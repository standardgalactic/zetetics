Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model 
Providing a comprehensive introduction to quantum field theory, this textbook covers the 
development of particle physics from its foundations to the discovery of the Higgs boson. 
Its combination of clear physical explanations, with direct connections to experimental 
data, and mathematical rigor make the subject accessible to students with a wide vari-
ety of backgrounds and interests. Assuming only an undergraduate-level understanding of 
quantum mechanics, the book steadily develops the Standard Model and state-of-the art 
calculation techniques. It includes multiple derivations of many important results, with 
modern methods such as effective field theory and the renormalization group playing a 
prominent role. Numerous worked examples and end-of-chapter problems enable students 
to reproduce classic results and to master quantum field theory as it is used today. Based 
on a course taught by the author over many years, this book is ideal for an introductory to 
advanced quantum field theory sequence or for independent study. 
MATTHEW D. SCHWARTZ is an Associate Professor of Physics at Harvard University.

Quantum field theory (QFf) provides an extremely powerful set of computational methods 
that have yet to find any fundamental limitations. It has led to the most fantastic agreement 
between theoretical predictions and experimental data in the history of science. It provides 
deep and profound insights into the nature of our universe, and into the nature of other 
possible self-consistent universes. On the other hand, the subject is a mess. Its foundations 
are flimsy, it can be absurdly complicated, and it is most likely incomplete. There are often 
many ways to solve the same problem and sometimes none of them are particularly satisfy-
ing. This leaves a formidable challenge for the design and presentation of an introduction 
to the subject. 
This book is based on a course I have been teaching at Harvard for a number of years. 
I like to start my first class by flipping the light switch and pointing out to the students 
that, despite their comprehensive understanding of classical and quantum physics, they 
still cannot explain what is happening. Where does the light comes from? The emission 
and absorption of photons is a quantum process for which particle number is not conserved; 
it is an everyday phenomenon which cannot be explained without quantum field theory. I 
then proceed to explain (with fewer theatrics) what is essentially Chapter 1 of this book. 
As the course progresses, I continue to build up QFT, as it was built up historically, as the 
logical generalization of the quantum theory of creation and annihilation of photons to the 
quantum theory of creation and annihilation of any particle. This book is based on lecture 
notes for that class, plus additional material. 
The main guiding principle of this book is that QFT is primarily a theory of physics, not 
of mathematics, and not of philosophy. QFT provides, first and foremost, a set of tools for 
performing practical calculations. These calculations take as input measured numbers and 
predict, sometimes to absurdly high accuracy, numbers that can be measured in other exper-
iments. Whenever possible, I motivate and validate the methods we develop as explaining 
natural (or at least in principle observable) phenomena. Partly, this is because I think hav-
ing tangible goals, such as explaining measured numbers, makes it easier for students to 
understand the material. Partly, it is because the connection to data has been critical in the 
historical development of QFT. 
The historical connection between theory and experiment weaves through this entire 
book. The great sucess of the Dirac equation from 1928 was that it explained the magnetic 
dipole moment of the electron (Chapter 10). Measurements of the Lamb shift in the late 
1940s helped vindicate the program of renormalization (Chapters 15 to 21). Measurements 
of inelastic electron-proton scattering experiments in the 1960s (Chapter 32) showed that 
QFT could also address the strong force. Ironically, this last triumph occurred only a few 
xv

Preface 
years after Geoffrey Chew famously wrote that QFT "is sterile with respect to strong inter-
actions and that, like an old soldier, it is destined not to die but just to fade away." [Chew, 
1961, p. 2]. Once asymptotic freedom (Chapter 26) and the renormalizability of the Stan-
dard Model (Chapter 21 and Part IV) were understood in the 1970s, it was clear that QFT 
was capable of precision calculations to match the precision experiments that were being 
performed. Our ability to perform such calculations has been steadily improving ever since, 
for example through increasingly sophisticated effective field theories (Chapters 22, 28, 
31,33,35 and 36), renormalization group methods (Chapter 23 and onward), and on-shell 
approaches (Chapters 24 and 27). The agreement of QFT and the Standard Model with 
data over the past half century has been truly astounding. 
Beyond the connection to experiment, 1 have tried to present QFT as a set of related 
tools guided by certain symmetry principles. For example, Lorentz invariance, the symme-
try group associated with special relativity, plays a essential role. QFT is the theory of the 
creation and destruction of particles, which is possible due to the most famous equation of 
special relativity E = mc2 . Lorentz invariance guides the definition of particle (Chapter 8), 
is critical to the spin-statistics theorem (Chapter 12), and strongly constrains properties of 
the main object of interest in this book: scattering or S-matrix elements (Chapter 6 and 
onward). On the other hand, QFT is useful in space-times for which Lorentz invariance 
is not an exact symmetry (such as our own universe, which since 1998 has been known 
to have a positive cosmological constant), and in non-relativistic settings, where Lorentz 
invariance is irrelevant. Thus, 1 am reluctant to present Lorentz invariance as an axiom of 
QFT (I personally feel that as QFT is a work in progress, an axiomatic approach is prema-
ture). Another important symmetry is unitarity, which implies that probabilities should add 
up to 1. Chapter 24 is entirely dedicated to the implications of unitarity, with reverberations 
throughout Parts IV and V. Unitarity is closely related to other appealing features of our 
description of fundamental physics, such as causality, locality, analyticity and the cluster 
decomposition principle. While unitarity and its avatars are persistent themes within the 
book, I am cautious of giving them too much of a primary role. For example, it is not clear 
how well cluster decomposition has been tested experimentally. 
I very much believe that QFT is not a finished product, but rather a work in progress. 
It has developed historically, it continues to be simplified, clarified, expanded and applied 
through the hard work of physicists who see QFT from different angles. While I do present 
QFT in a more or less linear fashion, I attempt to provide multiple viewpoints whenever 
possible. For example, I derive the Feynman rules in five different ways: in classical field 
theory (Chapter 3), in old-fashioned perturbation theory (Chapter 4), through a Lagrangian 
approach (Chapter 7), through a Hamiltonian approach (also Chapter 7), and through the 
Feynman path integral (Chapter 14). While the path-integral derivation is the quickest, 
it is also the farthest removed from the type of perturbation theory to which the reader 
might already be familiar. The Lagrangian approach illustrates in a transparent way how 
tree-level diagrams are just classical field theory. The old-fashioned perturbation theory 
derivation connects immediately to perturbation theory in quantum mechanics, and moti-
vates the distinct advantage of thinking off-shell, so that Lorentz invariance can be kept 
manifest at all stages of the calculation. On the other hand, there are some instances where 
an on-shell approach is advantageous (see Chapters 24 and 27). 

Preface 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Other examples of multiple derivations include the four explanations of the spin-
statistics theorem I give in Chapter 12 (direct calculation, causality, stability and Lorentz 
invariance of the S -matrix), the three ways I prove the path integral and canonical formula-
tions of quantum field theory equivalent in Chapter 14 (through the traditional Hamiltonian 
derivation, perturbatively through the Feynman rules, and non-perturbatively through the 
Schwinger-Dyson equations), and the three ways in which I derive effective actions in 
Chapter 33 (matching, with Schwinger proper time, and with Feynman path integrals). 
As different students learn in different ways, providing multiple derivations is one way in 
which I have tried to make QFT accessible to a wide audience. 
This textbook is written assuming that the reader has a solid understanding of quantum 
mechanics, such as what would be covered in a year-long undergraduate class. I have found 
that students coming in generally do not know much classical field theory, and must relearn 
special relativity, so these topics are covered in Chapters 2 and 3. At Harvard, much of the 
material in this book is covered in three semesters. The first semester covers Chapters 1 to 
22. Including both QED and renormalization in a single semester makes the coursework 
rather intense. On the other hand, from surveying the students, especially the ones who only 
have space for a single semester of QFT, I have found that they are universally glad that 
renormalization is covered. Chapter 22, on non-renormalizable theories, is a great place to 
end a semester. It provides a qualitative overview of the four forces in the Standard Model 
through the lens of renormalization and predictivity. 
The course on which this textbook is based has a venerable history, dominated by the 
thirty or so years it was taught by the great physicist Sidney Coleman. Sidney provides 
an evocative description of the period from 1966 to 1979 when theory and expeliment 
collaborated to firmly establish the Standard Model [Coleman, 1985, p. xii]: 
This was a great time to be a high-energy theorist, the period of the great triumph of 
quantum field theory. And what a triumph it was, in the old sense of the word: a glori-
ous victory parade, full of wondelful things brought back from far places to make the 
spectator gasp with awe and laugh with joy. 
Sidney was able to capture some of that awe and joy in his course, and in his famous Erice 
Lectures from which this quote is taken. Over the past 35 years, the parade has continued. 
I hope that this book may give you a sense of what all the fuss is about. 
Acknowledgements 
The book would not have been possible without the perpetual encouragement and enthusi-
asm of the many students who took the course on which this book is based. Without these 
students, this book would not have been written. The presentation of most of the material 
in this book, particularly the foundational material in Parts I to III, arose from an itera-
tive process. These iterations were promoted in no small part by the excellent questions 
the students posed to me both in and out of class. In ruminating on those questions, and 
discussing them with my colleagues, the notes steadily improved.

Preface 
I have to thank in particular the various unbelievable teaching assistants I had for the 
course, particularly David Simmons-Duffin, Clay Cordova, Ilya Feige and Prahar Mitra 
for their essential contributions to improving the course material. The material in this book 
was refined and improved due to critical conversations that I had with many people. In 
particular, I would like to thank Frederik Denef, Ami Katz, Aneesh Manohar, Yasunori 
Nomura, Michael Peskin, Logan Ramalingam, Matthew Reece, Subir Sachdev, lain Stew-
art, Matthew Strassler, and Xi Yin for valuable conversations. More generally, my approach 
to physics, by which this book is organized, has been influenced by three people most 
of all: Lisa Randall, Nima Arkani-Hamed and Howard Georgi. From them I learned to 
respect non-renormalizable field theories and to beware of smoke and mirrors in theoretical 
physics. 
I am indebted to Anders Andreassen, David Farhi, William Frost, Andrew Marantan and 
Prahar Mitra for helping me convert a set of decent lecture notes into a coherent and com-
prehensive textbook. I also thank Ilya Feige, Yang-Ting Chien, Yale Fan, Thomas Becher, 
Zoltan Ligeti and Marat Freytsis for critical comments on the advanced chapters of the 
book. 
Some of the material in the book is original, and some comes from primary literature. 
However, the vast majority of what I write is a rephrasing of results presented in the existing 
vast library of fantastic quantum field theory texts. The textbooks by Peskin and Schroeder 
and by Weinberg were especially influential. For example, Peskin and Schroeder's nearly 
perfect Chapter 5 guides my Chapter 13. Weinberg's comprehensive two volumes of The 
Quantum Theory of Fields are unequalled in their rigor and generality. Less general ver-
sions of many of Weinberg's explanations have been incorporated into my Chapters 8, 9, 
14 and 24. 
I have also taken some material from Srednicki's book (such as the derivation of the 
LSZ reduction formula in my Chapter 6), from Muta's book on quantum chromodyanmics 
(parts of my Chapters 13, 26 and 32), from Banks' dense and deep Concise Introduction 
(particularly his emphasis on the Schwinger-Dyson equations which affected my Chapters 
7 and 14), from Halzen and Martin's very physical book Quarks and Leptons (my Chapter 
32), Rick Field's book Applications Perturbative QCD (my Chapter 20). I have always 
found Manohar and Wise's monograph Heavy Quark Physics (on which my Chapter 35 
is based) to be a valuable reference, in particular its spectacularly efficient first chapter. 
Zee's Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell also had much influence on me (and on my 
Chapter 15). In addition, a few historical accounts come from Pais' Inward Bound, which 
I recommend any serious student of quantum field theory to devour. 
Finally, I would like to thank my wife Carolyn, for her patience, love and support as this 
book was being written, as well as for some editorial assistance.

On October 19, 1900, Max Planck proposed an explanation of the blackbody radiation 
spectrum involving a new fundamental constant of nature, h = 6.626 X 10-34 J s [Planck, 
1901]. Although Planck's result precipitated the development of quantum mechanics (i.e. 
the quantum mechanics of electrons), his original observation was about the quantum 
nature of light, which is a topic for quantum field theory. Thus, radiation is a great moti-
vation for the development of a quantum theory of fields. This introductory topic involves 
a little history, a little statistical mechanics, a little quantum mechanics, and a little quan-
tum field theory. It provides background and motivation for the systematic presentation of 
quantum field theory that begins in Chapter 2. 
1.1 Blackbody radiation 
In 1900, no one had developed a clear explanation for the spectrum of radiation from 
hot objects. A logical approach at the time was to apply the equipartition theorem, which 
implies that a body in thermal equilibrium should have energy equally distributed among 
all possible modes. For a hot gas, the theorem predicts the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion of thermal velocities, which is in excellent agreement with data. When applied to the 
spectrum of light from a hot object, the equipartition theorem leads to a bizarre result. 
A blackbody is an object at fixed temperature whose internal structure we do not 
care about. It can be treated as a hot box of light (or Jeans cube) in thermal equilib-
rium. Classically, a box of size L supports standing electromagnetic waves with angular 
frequencies

for integer 3-vectors ii, with c being the speed of light. Before 1900, physicists believed 
you could have as much or as little energy in each mode as you want. By the (classical) 
equipartition theorem, blackbodies should emit light equally in all modes with the intensity 
growing as the differential volume of phase space:

I(w) == V dw E(w) = const x c- w kBT 
(classical).

More simply, this classical result follows from dimensional analysis: it is the only quantity 
with units of energy x time x distance- 3 that can be constructed out of w, kBT and

c. We will set c = 1 from now on, since it can be restored by dimensional analysis (see 
Appendix A). 
The classical spectrum implies that the amount of radiation emitted per unit frequency 
should increase with frequency, a result called the ultraviolet catastrophe. Experimen-
tally, the distribution looks more like a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, peaked at some 
finite W, as shown in Figure 1.1. Clearly the equipartition theorem does not work for 
blackbody radiation. 
The incompatibility of observations with the classical prediction led Planck to postu-
late that the energy of each electromagnetic mode in the cavity is quantized in units of 
frequency: J 
(1.3) 
where h is the Planck constant and n == 2:' Albert Einstein later interpreted this as imply-
ing that light is made up of particles (later called photons, by the chemist Gilbert Lewis). 
Note that if the excitations are particles, then they are massless: 
(1.4) 
If Planck and Einstein are right, then light is really a collection of massless photons. As 
we will see, there are a number of simple and direct experimental consequences of this 
hypothesis: quantizing light resolves the blackbody paradox; light having energy leads to 
the photoelectric effect; and light having momentum leads to Compton scattering. Most 
importantly for us, the energy hypothesis was the key insight that led to the development 
of quantum field theory. 
With Planck's energy hypothesis, the thermal distribution is easy to compute. Each mode 
of frequency Wn can be excited an integer number j times, giving energy jEn = j(nwn) 
I Planck was not particularly worried about the ultraviolet catastrophe, since there was no strong argument why 
the equipartition theorem should hold universally; instead, he was trying to explain the observed spectrum. He 
first came up with a mathematical curve that fit data, generalizing previous work of Wilhelm Wien and Lord 
Rayleigh, then wrote down a toy model that generated this curve. The interpretation of his model as refening 
to photons and the proper statistical mechanics derivation of the blackbody spectrum did not come until years 
later. 

1.2 Einstein coefficients 
----------------------------------------------------------
in that mode. The probability of finding that much energy in the mode is the same 
as the probability of finding energy in anything, proportional to the Boltzmann weight 
exp( -energy /kBT). Thus, the expectation value of energy in each mode is

1924.)

It is this functional form that Planck showed in 1900 correctly matches experiment. 
What does this have to do with quantum field theory? In order for this derivation, which 
used equilibrium statistical mechanics, to make sense, light has to be able to equilibrate. For 
example, if we heat up a box with monochromatic light, eventually all frequencies must be 
excited. However, if different frequencies are different particles, equilibration must involve 
one kind of particle turning into another kind of particle. So, particles must be created and 
destroyed. Quantum field theory tells us how that happens. 
1.2 Einstein coefficients 
A straightforward way to quantify the creation of light is through the coefficient of spon-
taneous emission. This is the rate at which an excited atom emits light. Even by 1900, this 
phenomenon had been observed in chemical reactions, and as a form of radioactivity, but 
at that time it was only understood statistically. In 1916, Einstein came up with a simple 
proof of the relation between emission and absorption based on the existence of thermal 
equilibrium. In addition to being relevant to chemical phenomenology, his relation made 
explicit why a first principles quantum theory of fields was needed. 
Einstein's argument is as follows. Suppose we have a cavity full of atoms with energy 
levels E1 and E2. Assume there are n1 of the E1 atoms and n2 of the E2 atoms and let 
m.u = E2 - E1. The probability for an E2 atom to emit a photon of frequency wand transi-
tion to state E1 is called the coefficient for spontaneous emission A. The probability for 
5 

6 
Microscopic theory of radiation 
a photon of frequency w to induce a transition from 2 to 1 is proportional to the coefficient 
of stimulated emission B and to the number of photons of frequency w in the cavity, that 
is, the intensity I (w). These contribute to a change in n2 of the form 
dn2 = - [A + BI(w)] n2. 
(1.8) 
The probability for a photon to induce a transition from 1 to 2 is called the coefficient of 
absorption B'. Absorption decreases nl and increases n2 by B' I (w )nl. Since the total 
number of atoms is conserved in this two-state system, dnl + dn2 = O. Therefore, 
dn2 = -dnl = -[A + BI(w)] n2 + B'I(w)nl. 
(l.9) 
Even though we computed I (w) above for the equilibrium blackbody situation, these equa-
tions should hold for any I (w ). For example, I (w) could be the intensity of a laser beam 
we shine at some atoms in the lab. 
At this point, Einstein assumes the gas is in equilibrium. In equilibrium, the number 
densities are constant, dnl = dn2 = 0, and determined by Boltzmann distributions: 
where N is some normalization factor. Then 
and so 
I(w) =

However, we already know that in equilibrium

from Eq. (1.7). Since equilibrium must be satisfied at any temperature, i.e. for any (3, we 
must have

and 
A

(1.15) 
These are simple but profound results. The first, B = B', says that the coefficient of 
absorption must be the same as the coefficient for stimulated emission. The coefficients B 
and B' can be computed in quantum mechanics (not quantum field theory!) using time-
dependent perturbation theory with an external electromagnetic field. Then Eq. (1.15) 
determines A. Thus, all the Einstein coefficients A, Band B' can be computed without 
using quantum field theory. 
You might have noticed something odd in the derivation of Eqs. (1.14) and (1.15). We, 
and Einstein, needed to use an equilibrium result about the blackbody spectrum to derive 

1.3 Quantum field theory 
------------------------------------------------------------------
the AlB relation. Does spontaneous emission from an atom have anything to do with 
equilibrium of a gas? It does not seem that way, since an atom radiates at the same rate no 
matter what is around it. The calculation of AlB from first principles was not performed 
until 10 years after Einstein's calculation; it had to wait until the invention of quantum field 
theory. 
1.3 Quantum field theory 
The basic idea behind the calculation of the spontaneous emission coefficient in quan-
tum field theory is to treat photons of each energy as separate particles, and then 
to study the system with multi-particle quantum mechanics. The following treatment 
comes from a paper of Paul Dirac from 1927 [Dirac, 1927], which introduced the 
idea of second quantization. This paper is often credited for initiating quantum field 
theory. 
Start by looking at just a single-frequency (energy) mode of a photon, say of energy 
6.. This mode can be excited n times. Each excitation adds energy 6. to the system. So, 
the energy eigenstates have energies f1, 2f1, 36., .... There is a quantum mechanical sys-
tem with this property that you may remember from your quantum mechanics course: the 
simple harmonic oscillator (reviewed in Section 2.2.1 and Problem 2.7). 
The easiest way to study a quantum harmonic oscillator is with creation and annihilation 
operators, at and a. These satisfy 
(1.16) 
There is also the number operator N = at a, which counts modes: 
Nln) = nln). 
(1.17) 
Then, 
(1.18) 
Thus, at In) = C In + 1) for some constant C, which can be chosen real. We can determine 
C from the normalization (nln) = 1: 
C2 = (n + l1C21n + 1) = (nlaatln) = (nl(ata + 1)ln) = n + 1, 
so C = '>in + 1. Similarly, aln) = C/ln ~ 1) and 
C'2 = (n ~ llC'2ln ~ 1) = (nlata In) = n, 
so C' = Vii. The result is that 
aln) = vnln ~ 1). 
(1.19) 
(1.20) 
(1.21) 
While these normalization factors are simple to derive, they have important implications.

Microscopic theory of radiation 
Now, you may recall from quantum mechanics that transition rates can be computed 
using Fermi's golden rule. Fermi's golden rule says that the transition rate between two 
states is proportional to the matrix element squared: 
0.22) 
where the o-function serves to enforce energy conservation. (We will derive a similar for-
mula for the transition rate in quantum field theory in Chapter 5. For now, we just want to 
use quantum mechanics.) The matrix element M in this formula is the projection of the 
initial and final states on the interaction Hamiltonian: 
(1.23) 
In this case, we do not need to know exactly what the interaction Hamiltonian Hint is. All 
we need to know is that Hint must have some creation operator or annihilation operator to 
create the photon. Hint also must be Hermitian. Thus it must look like2 
{1.24) 
with HI having non-zero matrix elements between initial and final atomic states. 
For the 2 ---+ 1 transition, the initial state is an excited atom we call atoID2 with nw 
photons of frequency w = !:::"Ift: 
(1.25) 
The final state is a lower energy atom we call atoIDl with nw + 1 photons of energy b.: 
(1.26) 
So, 
M 2->l = (atoIDl; nw + 11(HJat + HIa)latoID2; nw/ 
= (atoIDlIHJlatoID2)(nW + 1lat lnw/ + (atoIDlIHIlatoID2)(nw + 1lalnw/ 
= M6(nw + 11nw + l/Vnw + 1 + 0 
= M6vnw + 1 
(1.27) 
where M6 = (atoIDlIHJlatoID2/' Thus, 
IM2->ll2 = IMol2(nw + 1). 
(1.28) 
If instead we are exciting an atom, then the initial state has an unexcited atom and nw 
photons: 
(1.29) 
2 Dirac derived HI from the canonical introduction of the vector potential into the Hamiltonian: H = 2~V --t 
2~ (p + eA)2. This leads to Hint ~ ~ A . P representing the photon interacting with the atom's electric 
dipole moment. In our coarse approximation, the photon field A is represented by a and so HI must be 
related to the momentum operator p. Fortunately, all that is needed to derive the Einstein relations is that HI 
is something with non-zero matrix elements between different atomic states; thus, we can be vague about its 
precise definition. For more details consult [Dirac, 1927] or [Dirac, 1930. Sections 61-64].

and the final state has an excited atom and nw - 1 photons: 
(11 = (atomz; nw - 11. 
This leads to 
and therefore,

dn2 = -dnl = -IMz-+112nz + IM1-+212nl = -IMoI2(nw + l)nz + IM oI2(nw)nl' 
(1.32) 
This is pretty close to Einstein's equation, Eq. (1.9): 
dn2 = -dnl = -[A + BI(w)] nz + B'I(w)nl' 
(1.33) 
To get them to match exactly, we just need to relate the number of photon modes of fre-
quency w to the intensity I(w). Since the energies are quantized by f1 = nw = n Zz 1711, the 
total energy is

(1.34) 
We should mUltiply this by 2 for the two polarizations of light. (Dirac actually missed this 
factor in his 1927 paper, since polaIization was not understood at the time.) Including the 
factor of 2, the intensity is 
(1.35) 
This equation is a standard statistical mechanical relation, independent of what nw actually 
is; its deIivation required no mention of temperature or of equilibIium, just a phase space 
integral. 
So now we have 
dn2 = -dnl = -IMolz [1 + ':3I(w)]n2 + IMol2 [':3I(w)]n1

without ever having to assume thermal equilibrium. This beautiful deIivation was one of 
the first ever results in quantum field theory.

Lorentz invariance and second 
quantization 
In the previous chapter, we saw that by treating each mode of electromagnetic radiation in a 
cavity as a simple harmonic oscillator, we can derive Einstein's relation between the coeffi-
cients of induced and spontaneous emission without resorting to statistical mechanics. This 
was our first calculation in quantum electrodynamics (QED). It is not a coincidence that 
the harmonic oscillator played an important role. After all, electromagnetic waves oscil-
late harmonically. In this chapter we will review special relativity and the simple harmonic 
oscillator and show how they are connected. This leads naturally to the notion of second 
quantization, which is a poorly chosen phrase used to describe the canonical quantization 
of relativistic fields. 
It is worth mentioning at this point that there are two ways commonly used to quan-
tize a field theory, both of which are covered in depth in this book. The first is canonical 
quantization. This is historically how quantum field theory was understood, and closely 
follows what you learned in quantum mechanics. The second way is called the Feynman 
path integral. Path integrals are more concise, more general, and certainly more formal, 
but when using path integrals it is sometimes hard to understand physically what you are 
calculating. It really is necessary to understand both ways. Some calculations, such as the 
LSZ formula which relates scattering amplitudes to correlation function (see Chapter 6), 
require the canonical approach, while other calculations, such as non-perturbative quan-
tum chromodynamics (see Chapter 25), require path integrals. There are other ways to 
peclorm quantum field theory calculations, for example using old-fashioned perturbation 
theory (Chapter 4), or using Schwinger proper time (Chapter 33). Learning all of these 
approaches will give you a comprehensive picture of how and why quantum field theory 
works. We start with canonical quantization, as it provides the gentlest introduction to 
quantum field theory. 
From now on we will set Ii = c = 1. This gives all quantities dimensions of mass to 
some power (see Appendix A). 
2.1 Lorentz invariance 
Quantum field theory is the result of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. 
Special relativity is relevant when velocities are a reasonable fraction of the speed of light, 
v rv 1. In this limit, a new symmetry emerges: Lorentz invariance. A system is Lorentz 
invariant if it is symmetric under the Lorentz group, which is the generalization of the 
rotation group to include both rotations and boosts. 

2.1 Lorentz invariance 
11 
--------------------------------------------------....... 
Nonnally, the more symmetric a system, the easier it is to solve problems. For example, 
solving the Schrodinger equation with a spherically symmetric potential (as in the hydro-
en atom) is much easier than solving it with a cylindrically symmetric potential (such as 
for the hydrogen molecule). So why is quantum field theory so much harder than quantum 
mechanics? The answer, as Sidney Coleman put it, is because E = mc2 . This famous 
relation holds for particles at rest. When particles move relativistically, their kinetic energy 
is comparable to or exceeds their rest mass, Ekin ~ m, which is only a factor of 2 away 
from the threshold for producing two particles. Thus, there is no regime in which the rel-
ativistic corrections of order v / c are relevant, but the effect from producing new particles 
is not. 
2.1.1 Rotations 
Lorentz invariance is symmetry under rotations and boosts. If you get confused, focus on 
perfecting your understanding of rotations alone. Then, consider boosts as a generalization. 
Rotations should be extremely familiar to you, and they are certainly more intuitive than 
boosts. Under two-dimensional (2D) rotations, a vector (x, y) transforms as 
x ----+ x cos e + y sin e, 
y ----+ -xsine + ycose. 
We can write this as 
(Xy) 
( x cos e + y sin e ) 
----+ -xsine + ycose 
( 
cose 
-sine 
or as 
sine) (x), 
cose 
y 
Xi ----+ Rijxj, 
xi = (~), 
i = 1,2. 
(2.1) 
(2.2) 
(2.3) 
(2.4) 
When an index appears twice, as in Rijxj, that index should be summed over (the Einstein 
summation convention), so RijXj = RilXl + Ri2X2. This is known as a contraction. 
Technically, we should write Xi = RJ x j. However, having upper and lower indices on 
the same object makes expressions difficult to read, so we will often just lower or raise all 
the indices. We will be careful about the index position if it is ever ambiguous. For the row 
vector, 
Xi = (x y) ----+ ( x 
y) ( c~s e 
sme 
(2.5) 
Note that RT = R- 1 . That is, 
(2.6) 
or equivalently, 
(2.7) 

12 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
This property (orthogonality) along with R preserving orientation (det R = 1) is enough 
to characterize R as a rotation. This algebraic characterization in Eq. (2.7) is a much more 
useful definition of the group than the explicit form of the rotation matrices as a function 
of e. The group of 2D rotations is also called the special orthogonal group 80(2). The 
group of 3D rotations is called 80(3). 
If we contract the upper and lower indices of a vector, we find 
Xi Xi = (x, y) G) = x2 + y2. 
(2.8) 
This is just the norm of the vector Xi and is invariant under rotations. To see that, note that 
under a rotation 
(2.9) 
since RT = R- 1 . In fact, another way to define the rotation group is as the set of linear 
transformations on jRn preserving the inner product XiXi = 6ijXixJ: 
(2.10) 
which you can check explicitly using Eq. (2.3). 
2.1.2 Lorentz transformations 
Lorentz transformations work exactly like rotations, except with some minus signs here and 
there. Instead of preserving r2 = x 2 + y2 + z2 they preserve 82 == t 2 - x 2 -
y2 -
z2. Instead 
of 3-vectors vi = (x, y, z) we use 4-vectors xJ10 = (t, x, y, z). We generally use Greek 
indices for 4-vectors and Latin indices for 3-vectors. We write XO for the time component 
of a 4-vector. 
Lorentz transformations acting on 4-vectors are matrices A satisfying 
(2.11) 
In this and future matrices, empty entries are O. gJ10V is known as the Minkowski metric. 
Sometimes we write TJJ10V for this metric, with gJ10V reserved for a general metric, as in 
general relativity. But outside of quantum gravity contexts, which will be clear when 
we encounter them, taking gJ10V = TJJ10V will cause no confusion in quantum field theory. 
Equation (2.11) says that Lorentz transformations preserve the Minkowskian inner product: 
(2.12) 
A rotation around the z axis leaves x 2 + y2 invariant while a boost in the z direction leaves 
t2 -
z2 invariant. So, instead of being sines and cosines, which satisfy cos2g + sin2e = 1, 
boosts are made from hyperbolic sines and cosines, which satisfy cosh2 (3 - sinh2 (3 = l. 
The Lorentz group is the most general set of transformations preserving the Minkowski 
metric. Up to some possible discrete transformations (see Section 2.1.3 below), a general 
Lorentz transformation can be written as a product of rotations around the x, y or z axes:

The Bi are ordinary rotation angles around the i axis, with 0 ~ Bi < 27f, and the f3i 
are hyperbolic angles sometimes called rapidities, with -00 < f3i < 00. Note that these 
matrices do not commute, so the order in which we do the rotations and boosts is important. 
We will rarely need an actual matrix representation of the group elements like this, but it 
is helpful to see. 
To relate the f3i to something useful, such as velocity, recall that for velocities v « 1 well 
below the speed of light, a boost should reduce to a Galilean transformation x -4 x + vt. 
The unique transformations that preserve t2 -x2 and reduce to the Galilean transformations

(2.16) 
These equations relate boosts to ordinary velocity. In particular, f3x = v to leading order 
in v. 
Scalar fields are functions of space-time that are Lorentz invariant. That is, under an 
arbitrary Lorentz transformation the field does not change: 
¢(x) -4 ¢(x). 
(2.17) 
Sometimes the notation ¢(xl-') -4 ¢((A-l)~ XV ) is used, which makes it seem like the 
scalar field is changing in some way. It is not. While our definitions of xl-' change in dif-
ferent frames xl-' -4 A~xv, the space-time point labeled by xl-' is fixed. That equations 
are invariant under relabeling of coordinates tells us absolutely nothing about nature. The 
physical content of Lorentz invariance is that nature has a symmetry under which scalar 
fields do not transform. Take, for example, the temperature of a fluid, which can vary from 
point to point. If we change reference frames, the labels for the points change, but the 
temperature at each point stays the same. A scalar (not scalar field) is just a number. For 
example, nand 7 and the electric charge e are scalars. 
Under Lorentz transformations A~, 4-vectors VI-' transform as 
VI-' -4 A~Vv. 
(2.18) 
13 

14 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
This transformation law is the defining property of a 4-vector. If VI-' is not just a number 
but depends on x, we write VI-'(x) and call it a vector field. Under Lorentz transforma-
tions, vector fields transform just like 4-vectors. For a vector field, as for a scalar field, 
the coordinates of x transform but the space-time point to which they refer is invariant. 
The difference from a scalar field is that the components of a vector field at the point x 
transform into each other as well. If you need a concrete example, think about how the 
components of the electric field E(x) rotate into each other under 3D rotations, while a 
scalar potential ¢(x) for which E(X) = V¢(x) is rotationally invariant. 
A vector field VI-'(x) is a set of four functions of space-time. A Lorentz-invariant theory 
constructed with vector fields has a symmetry: the result of calculations will be the same 
if the four functions are mixed up according to Eq. (2.18). For example, gl-'V81-' Vv(x) is 
Lorentz invariant at each space-time point x if and only if VI-' (x) transforms as a vector 
field under Lorentz transformations. If VI-' (x) were just a collection of four scalar fields, 
gl-'v 81-' Vv (x) would be frame-dependent. 
Some important 4-vectors are position: 
xl-' = (t,x,y, z), 
(2.19) 
derivatives with respect to xl-': 
(2.20) 
and momentum: 
(2.21) 
Tensors transform as 
(2.22) 
Tensor fields are functions of space-time, such as the energy-momentum tensor TI-'V(x) 
or the metric gl-'V (x) in general relativity. If you add more indices, such as Z I-'VOl{3, we still 
call it a tensor. The number of indices is the rank of a tensor, so TI-'v is rank 2, ZI-'VOl{3 is 
rank 4, etc. 
When the same index appears twice, it is contracted, just as for rotations. Contractions 
implicitly involve the Minkowski metric and are Lorentz invariant. For example: 
(2.23) 
Such a contraction is Lorentz invariant and transforms like a scalar Gust as the dot product 
of two 3-vectors V . lV, which is a contraction with Oij, is rotationally invariant). So, under 
a Lorentz transformation, 
(2.24) 
When writing contractions this way, you can usually just pretend 9 is the identity matrix. 
You will only need to distinguish 9 from 0 when you write out components. This is one of 
the reasons the 4-vector notation is very powerful. Contracting indices is just a notational 
convention, not a deep property of mathematics. 

2.1 Lorentz invariance 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
It is worth adding a few more words about raising and lowering indices in field theory. 
In general relativity, it is important to be careful about distinguishing vectors with lower 
indices (covariant vectors) and vectors with upper indices (contravariant vectors). When 
an index appears twice (in a contraction) the technically correct approach is for one index 
to be upper and one to be lower. However, that can make the notation very cumbersome. 
For example, if the indices are ordered, you must write V I-' (x) ----t AI-'l/ VI/ (x), which is 
different from VI-'(x) ----t AI/I-'VI/(x). It is easier just to write VI-' ----t AI-'I/VI/ where the 
index order is clear. In special relativity, we always contract with the Minkowski metric 
91-'1/ = '171-'1/' So, we will often forget about which indices are upper and which are lower 
and just use the modern contraction convention for which all contractions are equivalent: 
(2.25) 
Index position is important only when we plug in explicit vectors or matrices. 
Although the index position is not important for us, the actual indices are. You should 
never have anything such as 
(2.26) 
with three (or more) of the same indices. To avoid this, be very careful about relabeling. 
For example, do not write 
(2.27) 
instead write 
(2.28) 
You will quickly get the hang of all this contracting. 
The simplest Lorentz-invariant operator that we can write down involving derivatives is 
the d' Alembertian: 
D = 8; = 8; - 8; - 8; - 8;. 
(2.29) 
This is the relativistic generalization of the Laplacian: 
6 = '\72 = 8; + 8; + 8; . 
(2.30) 
Finally, it is worth keeping the terminology straight. We say that objects such as 
V2 = VjLVjL, 
</J, 
1, 
8jLVjL 
(2.31) 
are Lorentz invariant, meaning they do not depend on our Lorentz frame at all, while 
objects such as 
(2.32) 
are Lorentz covariant, meaning they do change in different frames, but precisely as 
the Lorentz transformation dictates. Something such as energy density is neither Lorentz 
invariant nor Lorentz covariant; it is instead the 00 component of a Lorentz tensor ~I/'

Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
2.1.3 Discrete transformations 
Lorentz transformations are defined to be those that preserve the Minkowski metric: 
(2.33) 
Equivalently, they are those that leave inner products such as 
(2.34) 
invariant. By this definition, the transformations 
P: (t, x, y, z) ----; (t, -x, -y, - z) 
(2.35) 
known as parity and 
T : (t,x , y, z ) ----; (-t,x,y,z) 
(2.36) 
known as time reversal are also Lorentz transformations. They can be written as 
- 1 
(2.37) 
-1 
Parity and time reversal are special because they cannot be written as the product of rota-
tions and boosts, Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14). Discrete transformations play an impOltant role in 
quantum field theory (see Chapter 11). 
We say that a vector is timelike when 
(2.38) 
and spacelike when 
VJ.lVJ.l < 0 
(spacelike). 
(2.39) 
Naturally, time = (t, 0, 0, 0) is timelike and space = (0, x, 0, 0) is spacelike. Whether 
something is timelike or spacelike is preserved under Lorentz transformations since the 
norm is preserved. If a vector has zero norm we say it is lightlike: 
VJ.lV/L = 0 
(lightlike). 
(2.40) 
If pJ.l is a 4-momentum, then (since p2 = m 2 ) it is lightlike if and only if it is massless. 
Photons are massless, which is the origin of the term lightlike. 
Many more details of the mathematical structure of the Lorentz group (such as its unitary 
representations) will be covered in Chapters 8 and 10. 
2.1.4 Solving problems with Lorentz invariance 
Special relativity in quantum field theory is much easier than the special relativity you 
learned in your introductory physics course. We never need to talk about putting long cars 
in small garages or engineers with flashlights on trains. These situations are all designed 

2.2 Classical plane waves as oscillators 
-----------------------------------------------------
o make your non-relativistic intuition mislead you. In quantum field theory, other than 
the perhaps unintuitive notion that energy can turn into matter through E = mc2 , your 
~on_relativistiC intuition will serve you perfectly well. 
For field theory, all you really need from special relativity is the one equation that defines 
Lorentz transformations: 
(2.41) 
This implies that contractions such as p2 == pM PM are Lorentz invariant. For problems that 
involve changing frames, usually you know everything in one frame and are interested in 
some quantity in another frame. For example, you may know momenta pi and p~ of two 
incoming particles that collide and are interested in the energy of an outgoing particle E3 
in the center-of-mass frame (the center-of-mass frame is defined as the frame in which 
the total 3-momenta, Ptot = 0). For such problems, it is best to first calculate a Lorentz-
invariant quantity such as P;ot = (pi + p~) 2 in the first frame, then go to the second frame, 
and solve for the unknown quantity. Since P;ot is Lorentz invariant, it has the same value 
in both frames. Usually, when you input everything you know about the second frame (e.g. 
Ptot = 0 if it is the center-of-mass frame), you can solve for the remaining unknowns. If 
you find yourself plugging in explicit boost and rotation matrices, you are probably solving 
the problem the hard way. This trick is especially useful for situations in which there are 
many particles, say pi, ... , p~, and therefore many Lorentz-invariant quantities, such as 
PiP4M or (p~ + p~)2 . 
2.2 Classical plane waves as oscillators 
We next review the simple harmonic oscillator and discuss the connection to special 
relativity. 
2.2.1 Simple harmonic oscillator 
Anything with a linear restoring potential (any potential is linear close enough to equilib-
rium), such as a spring, or a string with tension, or a wave, is a harmonic oscillator. For 
example, a spring has 
d2x 
m dt2 + kx = 0, 
(2.42) 
which is satisfied by x(t) = cos ( jI;,t), so it oscillates with frequency 
w={f. 
(2.43) 
A more general solution is 
(2.44) 
17 

18 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
The classical Hamiltonian for this system is the sum of kinetic and potential energies: 
1 p2 
1 
2 2 
H = - -
+ -mw x . 
(2.45) 
2 m 
2 
To quantize the harmonic oscillator, we promote x and p to operators and impose the 
canonical commutation relations 
[x ,p] = i. 
Analysis of the harmonic oscillator spectrum is simplest if we change variables to 
rmw ( 
iP ) 
a=YT x+ mw ' 
which satisfy 
so that 
H=w(ata+~). 
Thus, energy eigenstates are eigenstates of the number operator 
iT = ata, 
which is Hermitian. The results we derived in Section 1.3: 
iTln) = nln), 
atln) = Vn + lin + 1), 
aln) = v'nln - 1),

(2.50) 
(2.51) 
(2.52) 
(2.53) 
follow from these definitions. We can also calculate how the operators evolve in time (in 
the Heisenberg picture): 
i :ta = [a,H] = [a,w (ata +~)] = w(aata - ataa) = w[a, at]a = wa. 
(2.54) 
This equation is solved by 
a(t) = e- iwta(O). 
(2.55) 
2.2.2 Connection to special relativity 
To connect special relativity to the simple harmonic oscillator we note that the simplest 
possible Lorentz-invariant equation of motion that a field can satisfy is O¢ = O. That is, 
The classical solutions are plane waves. For example, one solution is 
¢(x) = ap(t)e'P'x, 
where 
(2.56) 
(2.57) 
(2.58) 

2.2 Classical plane waves as oscillators 
This is exactly the equation of motion of a harmonic oscillator. A general solution is 
¢(x, t) = J 
(~:~3 lap (t) eip.J5 + a; (t) e-iP''''] , 
(2.59) 
with (0; + if· p)ap(t) = 0, which is just a Fourier decomposition of the field into plane 
waves. Or more simply 
J

with ap and a; now just numbers and PI" == (wp,P) with wp == 1P1. To be extra clear about 
notation, px contains an implicit 4-vector contraction: px = pl"xl" = wpxo - if· x. 
Not only is O¢ = ° 
the simplest Lorentz-invariant field equation possible, it is one of 
the equations that free massless fields will always satisfy (up to some exotic exceptions). 
For example, recall that there is a nice Lorentz-covariant treatment of electromagnetism 
using 
( 
0 
Ex 
Ey 
E" ) 
- E 
0 
- Bz 
By 
Fl"v == 
- E: 
E z 
0 
-Ex 
. 
(2.61) 
-Ez -Ey 
Ex 
0 
This Fl"v transforms covariantly as a tensor under Lorentz transformations and thus con-
cisely encodes how E and jj rotate into each other under boosts. In terms of Fl"v, 
Maxwell's equations in empty space have the simple forms 
Any field satisfying these equations can be written as 
Fl"v = 0I"Av - OvAI"' 
(2.62) 
(2.63) 
Although not necessary, we can also require 0I"AI" = 0, which is a gauge choice (Lorenz 
gauge). We will discuss gauge invariance in great detail in Chapters 8 and 25. For now, it 
is enough to know that the physical E and jj fields can be combined into an antisymmetric 
tensor Fl"v, which is determined by a 4-vector AI" satisfying 0I"AI" = O. In Lorenz gauge, 
Maxwell's equations reduce to 
(2.64) 
Thus, each component of Av satisfies the minimal Lorentz-invariant equation of motion. 
That O¢ = 0 for a scalar field and OAI" = 0 for a vector field have the same form is not a 
coincidence. The electromagnetic field is made up of particles of spin 1 called photons. The 
polarizations of the field are encoded in the four fields A" (x). In fact, massless particles 
of any spin will satisfy 0Xi = 0 where the different fields, indexed by i, encode different 
polarizations of that particle. This is not obvious, and we are not ready to prove it, so let us 
focus simply on the electromagnetic field. For simplicity, we will ignore polarizations for 
now and just treat Av as a scalar field ¢ (such approximations were used in some of the 
earliest QED papers, e.g. [Born et al., 1926]). A general solution to Maxwell's equations 
in Lorenz gauge is therefore given by Eq. (2.60) for each polarization (polarizations will 
19 

20 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
be explained in Chapter 8). Such a solution simply represents the Fourier decomposition 
of electromagnetic fields into plane waves. The oscillation of the waves is the same as the 
oscillation of a harmonic oscillator for each value of p. 
2.3 Second quantization 
Since the modes of an electromagnetic field have the same classical equations as a simple 
harmonic oscillator, we can quantize them in the same way. We introduce an annihilation 
operator ap and its conjugate creation operator ab for each wavenumber p and integrate 
over them to get the Hamiltonian for the free theory: 
Ho = J (~~3WP (ab ap + ~), 
(2.65) 
with 
Wp = 1151. 
(2.66) 
This is known as second quantization. At the risk of oversimplifying things a little, that 
is all there is to quantum field theory. The rest is just quantum mechanics. 
First quantization refers to the discrete modes, for example, of a particle in a box. Second 
quantization refers to the integer numbers of excitations of each of these modes. However, 
this is somewhat misleading - the fact that there are discrete modes is a classical phe-
nomenon. The two steps really are (1) interpret these modes as having energy E = !iw and 
(2) quantize each mode as a harmonic oscillator. In that sense we are only quantizing once. 
Whether second quantization is a good name for this procedure is semantics, not physics. 
There are two new features in second quantization: 
1. We have many quantum mechanical systems - one for each p - all at the same time. 
2. We interpret the nt h excitation of the pharmonic oscillator as having n particles. 
Let us take a moment to appreciate this second point. Recall the old simple harmonic 
oscillator: the electron in a quadratic potential. We would never interpret the states In) of 
this system as having n electrons. The fact that a pointlike electron in a quadratic potential 
has analogous equations of motion to a Fourier component of the electromagnetic field is 
just a coincidence. Do not let it confuse you. Both are just the simplest possible dynamical 
systems, with linear restoring forces. 1 
In second quantization, the Hilbert space is promoted to a Fock space, which is defined 
at each time as a direct sum, 
(2.67) 
1 To set up a proper analogy we need to first treat the electron as a classical field (we do not know how to do 
that yet), and find a set of solutions (such as the discrete frequencies of the electromagnetic waves). Then we 
would quantize each of those solutions, allowing In) excitations. However, if we did this, electrons would have 
Bose-Einstein statistics. Instead, they must have Fermi-Dirac statistics, so we would have to restrict n to 0 or 
1. The second quantization of electrons will be discussed in Chapters 10 through 12, and the interpretation of 
an electron as a classical field, which requires Grassmann numbers, in Chapter 14. 

2.3 Second quantization 
of Hilbert spaces, Hn , of physical n-particle states. If there is one particle type, states in 
'Hn are linear combinations of states {Ipi, ... , p~ ) } of all possible momenta satisfying 
p; = m 2 with p? > O. If there are many different particle types, the Fock space is the 
direct sum of the Hilbert spaces associated with each particle. The Fock space is the same 
at all times, by time-translation invariance, and in any frame, by Lorentz invariance. Note 
that the Fock space is not a sum over Hilbert spaces defined with arbitrary 4-vectors, since 
the energy for a physical state is determined by its 3-momentum Pi and its mass mi as 
p? = V pl + m;' We thus write Ip), IpIL) and Ip) interchangeably. 
2.3.1 Field expansion 
Now let us get a little more precise about what the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.65) means. The 
natural generalizations of 
[a,atj = 1 
(2.68) 
are the equal-time commutation relations 
(2.69) 
The factors of 27r are a convention, stemming from our convention for Fourier transforms 
(see Appendix A). These a~ operators create particles with momentum p: 
(2.70) 
where Ip) is a state with a single pa11icle of momentum p. This factor of V2wp is 
just another convention, but it will make some calculations easier. Its nice Lorentz 
transformation properties are studied in Problem 2.6. 
To compute the normalization of one-particle states, we start with 
(010) = I , 
(2.71) 
which leads to 
(2.72) 
The identity operator for one-particle states is 
(2.73) 
which we can check with

(27r)3 2wp Ip) (p Ik) = 
(27r)3 2wp 2wp(27r) J (p - k) Ip ) = Ik). 
(2.74) 
We then define quantum fields as integrals over creation and annihilation operators for 
each momentum: 
(2.75) 
21 

22 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
where the subscript 0 indicates this is a free field. The factor of yf2W; is included for later 
convenience. 
This equation looks just like the classical free-particle solutions, Eq. (2.59), to Maxwell's 
equations (ignoring polarizations) but instead of ap and at being jitnctions, they are now 
the annihilation and creation operators for that mode. Sometimes we say the classical ap is 
c-number valued and the quantum one is q-number valued. The connection with Eq. (2.59) 
is only suggestive. The quantum equation, Eq. (2.75), should be taken as the definition of 
a field operator ¢o(x) constructed from the creation and annihilation operators ap and at. 
To get a sense of what the operator ¢o does, we can act with it on the vacuum and project 
out a momentum component: 
(2.76) 
This is the same thing as the projection of a position state on a momentum state in one-
particle quantum mechanics: 
(2.77) 
So, ¢o(x)IO) = Ix), that is, ¢o(x) creates a particle at position X. This should not be sur-
prising, since ¢o(x) in Eq. (2.75) is very similar to x = a + at in the simple harmonic 
oscillator. Since ¢o is Hermitian, (xl = (Ol¢o(x) as well. 
By the way, there are many states 1?jJ) in the Fock space that satisfy (P1?jJ) = e- iPX. Since 
(P1 only has non-zero matrix elements with one-particle states, adding to Ix) a two- or zero-
particle state, as in ¢6 (x) 10), has no effect on (P1x). That is, 1?jJ) = (¢o (x) + ¢6(x)) 10) 
also satisfies (P1?jJ) = e- ipx. The state Ix) == ¢o(x)IO) is the unique one-particle state with 
(P1?jJ) = e-ipx. 
2.3.2 Time dependence 
In quantum field theory, we generally work in the Heisenberg picture, where all the time 
dependence is in operators such as ¢ and ap . For free fields, the creation and annihilation 
operators for each momentum if in the quantum field are just those of a simple harmonic 
oscillator. These operators should satisfy Eq. (2.55), ap(t) = e-iwptap, and its conjugate 
at(t) = eiwptat, where ap and at (without an argument) are time independent. Then, we 
can define a quantum scalar field as 
(2.78) 
with pI" == (wp, if) and wp = I ifl as in Eq. (2.60). The 0 subscript still indicates that these 
are free fields. 

2.3 Second qUantization 
-------------------------------------------------------------
To be clear, there is no physical content in Eq. (2.78). It is just a definition. The physical 
content is in the algebra of ap and at and in the Hamiltonian Ho. Nevertheless, we will 
see that collections of ap and at in the form of Eq. (2.78) are very useful in quantum field 
theory. For example, you may note that while the integral is over only three components 
of PP' the phases have combined into a manifestly Lorentz-invariant form. This field now 
automatically satisfies O¢( x) = O. If a scalar field had mass m, we could still write it in 
exactly the same way but with a massive dispersion relation: wp == /t9 + m2 . Then the 
quantum field still satisfies the classical equation of motion: (D + m 2 )¢(x) = O. 
Let us check that our free Hamiltonian is consistent with the expectation for time 
evolution. Commuting the free fields with Ho we find 
( ~ )]-J~J~_l [ (t

(27r)\/2wp 
wpap e 
+ wpape 
= -iot¢o(x, t), 
(2.79) 
which is exactly the expected result. 
For any Hamiltonian, quantum fields satisfy the Heisenberg equations of motion: 
iot¢(x) = [¢, H]. 
(2.80) 
In a free theory, H = Ho, and this is consistent with Eq. (2.78). In an interacting theory, 
that is, one whose Hamiltonian H differs from the free Hamiltonian Ho, the Heisenberg 
equations of motion are still satisfied, but we will rarely be able to solve them exactly. To 
study interacting theories, it is often useful to use the same notation for interacting fields 
as for free fields: 
"'( ~ t) - J d

e 
. 
(2.81) 
At any fixed time, the full interacting creation and annihilation operators at(t) and ap(t) 
satisfy the same algebra as in the free theory - the Fock space is the same at every time, due 
to time-translation invariance. We can therefore define the exact creation operators ap (t) 
to be equal to the free creation operators ap at any given fixed time, ap(to) = ap and so 
¢(x, to) = ¢o(x, to). However, the operators that create particular momentum states Ip) in 
the interacting theory mix with each other as time evolves. We generally will not be able to 
sol ve the dynamics of an interacting theory exactly. Instead, we will expand H = H 0 + Hint 
and calculate amplitudes using time-dependent perturbation theory with Hint, just as in 
quantum mechanics. In Chapter 7, we use this approach to derive the Feynman rules. 
The first -quantized (quantum mechanics) limit of the second-quantized theory (quantum 
field theory) comes from restricting to the one-particle states, which is appropriate in the 
non-relativistic limit. A basis of these states is given by the vectors (x I = (x, tl: 
(xl = (01 ¢(x, t). 
(2.82) 
Then, a Schrodinger picture wavefunction is 
'l/J(x) = (xl'l/J) , 
(2.83) 
23 

24 
Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
which satisfies 
(2.84) 
In the massive case, the free quantum field ¢o(x) satisfies 8;¢o = (V2 - m2) ¢o and we 
have from Eq. (2.79) (with the massive dispersion relation wp = liP + m 2 ): 
i(018t¢(x, t)I1/J) = (01 J 
(d
3p
)3 v~m2 (ape- iPX - a~eipx) Iw) 
27f 
2wp 
= (01Vm2 - V2¢o(x)lw). 
(2.85) 
So, 
The final form is the low-energy (large-mass) expansion. We can then define the non-
relativistic Hamiltonian by subtracting off the mc2 contribution to the energy, which is 
irrelevant in the non-relativistic limit. This gives 
(2.87) 
which is the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for a free theory. Another way to derive 
the quantum mechanics limit of quantum field theory is discussed in Section 33.6.2. 
2.3.3 Commutation relations 
We will occasionally need to use the equal-time commutation relations of the second-
quantized field and its time derivative. The commutator of a field at two different points is 
Using Eq. (2.69), [ak, at] = (27f)3 03(j) - k), this becomes 
[¢(x), ¢(Y)] = J d

Since the integral measure and wp = Vj)2 + m 2 are symmetric under j) ---t -j)we can flip

The equivalent calculation at different times is much more subtle (we discuss the general 
result in Section 12.6 in the context of the spin-statistics theorem). 
Next, we note that the time derivative of the free field, at t = 0, has the form

(2.91) 
where 1T is the operator canonically conjugate to 1/>. As 1/>(£) is the second-quantized analog 
of the x operator, 1T(£) is the analog of the fJ operator. Note that 1T(£) has nothing to do 
with the physical momentum of states in the Hilbert space: 1T(£) 10) is not a state of given 
momentum. Instead, it is a state also at position £ created by the time derivative of 1/>(£). 
Now we compute

(2.92) 
Both of these integrals give (y3(£ - fJ), so we find 
(2.93) 
which is the analog of [x, fJ] = i in quantum mechanics. It encapsulates the field theory 
version of the uncertainty principle: you cannot know the properties of the field and its rate 
of change at the same place at the same time. 
In a general interacting theory, at any fixed time, 1/>(£) and 1T(£) have expressions in 
terms of creation and annihilation operators whose algebra is identical to that of the free 
theory. Therefore, they satisfy the commutation relations in Eqs. (2.90) and (2.93) as well 
as [1T(£) , 1T(Y)] = O. The Hamiltonian in an interacting theory should be expressed as a 
functional of the operators 1/>(£) and 1T(£) with time evolution given by OtO = i[H,O]. 
Any such Hamiltonian can then be expressed entirely in terms of creation and annihilation 
operators using Eqs. (2.75) and (2.91); thus it has a well-defined action on the associated 
Fock space. Conversely, it is sometimes more convenient (especially for non-relativistic or 
condensed matter applications) to derive the form of the Hamiltonian in terms of ap and 
abo We can then express ap and ab in terms of 1/>(£) and 1T(£) by inverting Eqs. (2.75) and 
(2.91) for ap and ab (the solution is the field theory equivalent of Eq. (2.47)). 
In summary, all we have done to quantize the electromagnetic field is to treat it as an 
infinite set of simple harmonic oscillators, one for each wavenumber p. More generally: 
Quantum field theory is just quantum mechanics with an infinite number of harmonic 
oscillators.

Lorentz invariance and second quantization 
2.3.4 Einstein coefficients revisited 
In quantum mechanics we usually study a single electron in a background potential V(x). 
In quantum field theory, the background (e.g. the electromagnetic system) is dynamical, so 
all kinds of new phenomena can be explained. We already saw one example in Chapter 1. 
We can now be a little more explicit about what the relevant Hamiltonian should be for 
Dirac's calculation of the Einstein coefficients. 
We can always write a Hamiltonian as 
(2.94) 
where Ho describes some system that we can solve exactly. In the case of the two-state 
system discussed in Chapter 1, we can take Ho to be the sum of the Hamiltonians for the 
atom and the photons: 
Ho = H atom + Hphoton-
(2.95) 
The eigenstates of H atom are the energy eigenstates l7Pn) of the hydrogen atom, with 
energies En. Hphoton is the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.65) above: 
Hphoton = ! (~: ~3 Wk ( akak + ~) . 
(2.96) 
The remaining Hint is hopefully small enough to let us use perturbation theory. 
Fermi's golden rule from quantum mechanics says the rate for transitions between two 
states is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the interaction between the two 
states: 
(2.97) 
and we can treat the interaction semi-classically: 
(2.98) 
As mentioned in Footnote 2 in Chapter 1, HI can be derived from the ~jJ. A interaction 
of the minimally coupled non-relativistic Hamiltonian, H = 2;' (jJ + eA)2. Since we are 
ignoring spin, it does not pay to be too precise about HI; the important point being only 
that Hint has a quantum field ¢ in it, representing the photon, and HI has non-zero matrix 
elements between different atomic states. 
According to Fermi's golden rule, the transition probability is proportional to the matrix 
element of the interaction squared. Then, 
Ml--+2 = (atom*;nk -IIHint latom;nk) ex (atom* IHI I atom) yrLk, 
M2--+1 = (atom; nk + IIHintlatom*; nk) ex (atomIHIlatom*) Vnk + 1,

ThuS, MI~2 and M2---7I agree with what we used in Chapter 1 to reproduce Dirac's 
calculation of the Einstein coefficients. Note that we only used one photon mode, of 
momentum k, so this was really just quantum mechanics. Quantum field theory just gave 
us a S-function from the d3p integration.

background.

We have now seen how quantum field theory is just quantum mechanics with an infinite 
number of oscillators. We already saw that it can do some remarkable things, such as 
explain spontaneous emission. But it also seems to lead to absurdities, such as an infinite 
shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom (see Chapter 4). To show that quantum field 
theory is not absurd, but extremely predictive, we will have to be very careful about how we 
do calculations. We will begin by going through carefully some of the predictions that the 
theory gets right without infinities. These are called the tree-level processes, which means 
they are leading order in an expansion in n. Since taking n -> 0 gives the classical limit, 
tree-level calculations are closely related to calculations in classical field theory, which is 
the subject of this chapter. 
3.1 Hamiltonians and Lagrangians 
A classical field theory is just a mechanical system with a continuous set of degrees 
of freedom. Think about the density of a fluid p(x) as a function of position, or the 
electric field E (x). Field theories can be defined in terms of either a Hamiltonian or a 
Lagrangian, which we often write as integrals over all space of Hamiltonian or Lagrangian 
densities: 
(3.1) 
We will use a calligraphic script for densities and an italic script for integrated quantities. 
The word "density" is almost always omitted. 
Formally, the Hamiltonian (density) is a functional of fields and their conjugate 
momenta H [¢, 7r]. The Lagrangian (density) is the Legendre transform of the Hamiltonian 
(density). Formally, it is defined as 
£[¢, ¢] = 7r[¢, ¢] ¢ - H[¢, 7r[¢, ¢]], 
(3.2) 
where ¢ = at¢ and 7r[¢, ¢] is implicitly defined by &~!'7fJ = ¢. The inverse transform is 
(3.3) 
where ¢[¢, 7r] is implicitly defined by &.c~:,J,J = 7r.

To make this more concrete, consider this example:

1'2 
1 
~ 2 
1: = 2(8~¢)(8~¢) - V[¢] = 2¢ - 2(\7¢) - V[¢], 
(3.4) 
where V[¢] is called the potential (density). Then 7r = ~~ = ¢, which is easy to solve for 
¢: ¢[¢, 7r] = 7r. Plugging in to Eq. (3.3) we find 
. 
. 
1 2 
1 
~ 
2 
7-{ = 7r¢[¢,7r]- 1:[¢,¢[¢,7r]] = 27r + 2 (\7¢) + V[¢]. 
(3.5) 
We often just write 7-{ = ~¢2 + ~ (\7 ¢)2 + V[¢] so that we do not have to deal with the 7r 
fields. For a more complicated Lagrangian it may not be possible to produce a closed-form 
expression for ¢[¢,7r]. For example, 1: = ¢2¢2 + ¢¢3 would imply 7r = 2¢2¢ + 3¢¢2 
from which ¢[¢, 7r] is a mess. There are also situations where the Legendre transform may 
not exist, so that a Hamiltonian does not have a corresponding Lagrangian, or vice versa. I 
Equations (3.4) and (3.5) inspire the identification of the Hamiltonian with the sum of 
the kinetic and potential energies of a system: 
'H = K+ V, 
(3.6) 
while the Lagrangian is their difference: 
1: = K - V. 
(3.7) 
Matching onto Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5), the kinetic energy is the part with time derivatives, 
K = ~¢2, and the potential energy is the rest, V = ~('\7¢)2 + V[¢]. 
The Hamiltonian corresponds to a conserved quantity - the total energy of a system -
while the Lagrangian does not. The problem with Hamiltonians, however, is that they are 
not Lorentz invariant. The Hamiltonian picks out energy, which is not a Lorentz scalar; 
rather, it is the 0 component of a Lorentz vector: p~ = (H, P). The Hamiltonian density 
is the 00 component of a Lorentz tensor, the energy-momentum tensor ~v. Hamiltonians 
are great for non-relativistic systems, but for relativistic systems we will almost exclusively 
use Lagrangians. 
We do not usually talk about kinetic and potential energy in quantum field theory. Instead 
we talk about kinetic terms and then about interactions, for reasons that will become clear 
after we have done a few calculations. Kinetic terms are bilinear, meaning they have 
exactly two fields. So kinetic terms are 
(3.8) 
where 
(3.9) 
I The Legendre transform isjust trading velocity, ¢" for a new variable called 11", which corresponds to momentum 
in simple cases. It does this trade at each value of <p, so <p just goes along for the ride in the Legendre transform. 
So let us hold ¢ fixed and write ,L[4>]. No information is lost in writing 4> as 11" as long as 11" = .c'[4>l and 
¢ are in one-to-one correspondence. For a function f(x), x and f'(x) are in one-to-one correspondence as 
long as f" (x) > 0 Of f" (x) < 0 for all x, that is, if the function is convex. Therefore, one can go back 
and forth between the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian as long as .c[¢, 4>] is a convex function of 1> at each 
value of ¢ and 7-{ [¢, 11"] is a convex function of 11". For multiple fields, ¢n and 1fn, the requirement is that 
Mij = oH [¢n, 1fn] /01l";01fj be an invertible matrix. 

31 
3.2 The Euler-Lagrange equations 
-----------------------~~--------------- ~~ ... 
It is standard to use the letters ¢ or 7r for scalar fields, 'IjJ,~ , X for fermions, Ap" JJ-L' Vp, for 
vectors and hp,II' TJ-LII for tensors. 
Anything with just two fields of the same or different type can be called a kinetic term. 
The kinetic terms tell you about the free (non-interacting) behavior. Fields with kinetic 
terms are said to be dynamical or propagating. More precisely, a field should have time 
derivatives in its kinetic term to be dynamical. It is also sometimes useful to think of a 
mass term, such as m 2 ¢2, as an interaction rather than a kinetic term (see Problem 7.4). 
Interactions have three or more fields: 
(3.10) 
Since the interactions are everything but the kinetic terms, we also sometimes write 
(3.11) 
It is helpful if the coefficients of the interaction terms are small in some sense, so that the 
fields are weakly interacting and we can do perturbation theory. 
3.2 The Euler-Lagrange equations 
In quantum field theory, we will almost exclusively use Lagrangians. The simplest reason 
for this is that Lagrangians are manifestly Lorentz invariant. Dynamics for a Lagrangian 
system are determined by the principle of least action. The action is the integral over time 
of the Lagrangian: 
5 = J 
dtL = J 
d4x£(x). 
(3.12) 
Say we have a Lagrangian £[¢' 0J-L¢] that is a functional only of a field ¢ and its first 
derivatives. Now imagine varying ¢ -+ ¢ + o¢ where o¢ can be any field. Then, 
J 
4 
[0£ 
8£ 
] 
05= 
d x 8¢ 0¢+ 8(8p,¢)0(8J-L¢) 
= J 
d4x {[~~ -8J-L8(~~¢) ] 0¢+8J-L[8(~~¢)0¢]}
. 
(3.13) 
The last term is a total derivative and therefore its integral only depends on the field values 
at spatial and temporal infinity. We will always make the physical assumption that our 
fields vanish on these asymptotic boundaries, which lets us drop such total derivatives 
from Lagrangians. In other words, it lets us integrate by parts within Lagrangians, without 
consequence. That is 
(3.14) 
in a Lagrangian. We will use this identity constantly in both classical and quantum field 
theory. 
In classical field theory, just as in classical mechanics, the equations of motion are deter-
mined by the principle of least action: when the action is evaluated on fields that satisfy the 

32 
Classical field theory 
equations of motion, it should be insensitive to small variations of those fields, ~~ = O. If 
this holds for all variations, then Eq. (3.13) implies 
o£ 
o£ 
01/> - 01' o(aj.tl/» = o. 
(3.15) 
These are the celebrated Euler-Lagrange equations. They give the equations of motion 
following from a Lagrangian. 
For example, if our action is 
(3.16) 
then the equations of motion are 
(3.17) 
Or, more simply, 01/> + V' [I/>J = 0, recalling the d' Alembertian 0 == a~. In particular, if 
.c = ~ (aj.tl/» ( oj.tl/» -
~m21/>2, the equations of motion are 
(3.18) 
This is known as the Klein-Gordon equation. The Klein-Gordon equation describes the 
equations of motion for a free scalar field. 
Why do we restrict to Lagrangians of the form £ [I/>, aj.tl/>J? First of all, this is the form 
that all "classical" Lagrangians had. If only first derivatives are involved, boundary condi-
tions can be specified by initial positions and velocities only, in accordance with Newton's 
laws. In the quantum theory, if kinetic terms have too many derivatives, for example 
£ = 1/>021/>, there will generally be disastrous consequences. For example, there may be 
states with negative energy or negative norm, permitting the vacuum to decay (see Chap-
ters 8 and 24). But interactions with mUltiple derivatives may occur. Actually, they must 
occur due to quantum effects in all but the simplest renormalizable field theories; for exam-
ple, they are generic in all effective field theories, which are introduced in Chapter 22 and 
are the subject of much of Part IV. You can derive the equations of motion for general 
Lagrangians of the form £ [I/>, oj.tl/>, ovoj.tl/>, ... J in Problem 3.1. 
3.3 Noether's theorem 
It may happen that a Lagrangian is invariant under some special type of variation I/> ---+ 
I/> + 51/>. For example, a Lagrangian for a complex field I/> is 
(3.19) 
This Lagrangian is invariant under I/> ---+ e- iO!I/> for any a E R This transformation is 
a symmetry of the Lagrangian. There are two independent real degrees of freedom in a 

3.3 Noether's theorem 
---------------------------------------------------------------
complex field ¢, which we can take as ¢ = ¢1 + i¢2 or more conveniently ¢ and ¢*. Then 
the Lagrangian is 
(3.20) 
and the symmetry transformations are 
¢ ~ e-uy-¢, 
¢* ~ eia¢*. 
(3.21) 
You should check that the equations of motion following from this Lagrangian are 
(0 + m 2 ) ¢ = 0 and (0 + m 2 ) 4>* = O. 
When there is such a symmetry that depends on some parameter a that can be taken 
small (that is, ilie symmetry is continuous), we find, similar to Eq. (3.13), that 
(3.22) 
where ¢n may be ¢ and ¢* or whatever set of fields ilie Lagrangian depends on. In contrast 
to Eq. (3.13), this equation holds even for field configurations ¢n for which the action is 
not extremal (i.e. for ¢n that do not satisfy the equations of motion), since the variation 
cOlTesponds to a symmetry. 
When the equations of motion are satisfied, then Eq. (3.22) reduces to aJLJJL = 0, where 
(3.23) 
This is known as a Noether current. 
For example, with the Lagrangian in Eq. (3.19), 
S¢ _ _ 'r/..

that 
(3.26) 
which vanishes when the equations of motion O¢ = -m2¢ and O¢* 
_m2¢* are

A vector field JJL that satisfies oJLJJL = 0 is called a conserved current. It is called 
conserved because the total charge Q, defined as 
(3.27) 
satisfies

d x \7 . J = O.

Classical field theory 
In the last step we have assumed J vanishes at the spatial boundary, since, by assumption, 
nothing is leaving our experiment. Thus, the total charge does not change with time, and is 
conserved. 
We have just proved a very general and important theorem known as Noether's 
theorem. 
Noether's theorem 
If a Lagrangian has a continuous symmetry then there exists a current asso-
ciated with that symmetry that is conserved when the equations of motion 
are satisfied. 
Recall that we needed to assume the symmetry was continuous so that small variations ~~ 
could be taken. So, Noether's theorem does not apply to discrete symmetries, such as the 
symmetry under ¢ --> -¢ of £ = ~¢D¢ - m 2¢2 - A¢4 with ¢ real. 
Important points about this theorem are: 
• The symmetry must be continuous, otherwise oex has no meaning. 
• The current is conserved on-shell, that is, when the equations of motion are satisfied. 
• It works for global symmetries, parametrized by numbers ex, not only for local (gauge) 
symmetries parametrized by functions a(x). 
This final point is an important one, although it cannot be fully appreciated with what we 
have covered so far. Gauge symmetries will be discussed in Chapter 8, where we will see 
that they are required for Lagrangian descriptions of massless spin-l particles. Gauge sym-
metries imply global symmetries, but the existence of conserved currents holds whether or 
not there is a gauge symmetry or an associated massless spin-l particle. 
3.3.1 Energy-momentum tensor 
There is a very important case of Noether's theorem that applies to a global symmetry of 
the action, not the Lagrangian. This is the symmetry under (global) space-time translations. 
In general relativity this symmetry is promoted to a local symmetry - diffeomorphism 
invariance - but all one needs to get a conserved current is a global symmetry. The current 
in this case is the energy-momentum tensor, ~v' 
Space-time translation invariance says that physics at a point x should be the same as 
physics at any other point y. We have to be careful distinguishing this symmetry which 
acts on fields from a trivial symmetry under relabeling our coordinates. Acting on fields, it 
says that if we replace the value of the field ¢(x) with its value at a different point ¢(y), 
we will not be able to tell the difference. To turn this into mathematics, we consider cases 
where the new points yare related to the old points by a simple shift: yV = XV -
~v with 
~v a constant 4-vector. Scalar fields then transform as ¢( x) --> ¢( x + ~ ) . For infinitesimal 
~I', this is 
¢(x) --> ¢(x +~) = ¢(x) + ~ v ov¢(x) + .. . , 
(3.29) 

3.3 Noether's theorem 
------------------------------------------------------------------
where the· .. are higher order in the infinitesimal transformation ~v. To be clear, we are 
considering variations where we replace the field ¢( x) with a linear combination of the 
field and its derivatives evaluated at the same point x. The point x does not change. Our 
coordinates do not change. A theory with a global translation symmetry is invariant under 
this replacement. 
This transformation law, 
(3.30) 
applies for any field, whether tensor or spinor or anything else. It is also applies to the 
Lagrangian itself, which is a scalar: 
(3.31) 
Since this is a total derivative, oS = J d4x o.c = ~v J d4x 8v.c = 0, which is why we 
sometimes say this is a symmetry of the action, not the Lagrangian. 
Proceeding as before, using the equations of motion, the variation of the Lagrangian is 
0.c[rPn,8"rPn] = 8 ('"' 
8.c 
orPn) 
o~v 
" ~ 
8(8"rPn) o~v . 
(3.32) 
Equating this with Eq. (3.31) and using Eq. (3.30) we find 
8v.c = 8,,( ~ 
8(:"~n) 8vrPn) 
(3.33) 
or equivalently 
(3.34) 
The four symmetries have produced four Noether currents, one for each 1/: 
(3.35) 
all of which are conserved: 8" ~v = O. The four conserved quantities are energy and 
momentum. T"v is called the energy-momentum tensor. 
An important component of the energy-momentum tensor is the energy density: 
'"' 8.c . 
E = Too = ~ -·- rPn - .c, 
n 8rPn 
(3.36) 
where ¢n = 8t rPn. For Lagrangians that satisfy ¢ = ~~ == 7r the energy density is identical 
to the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, Eq. (3.3), so that the energy density and the 
Hamiltonian density are identical. 
The conserved charges corresponding to the energy-momentum tensor are Qv 
= 
J d3x Tov. The components of Qv are the total energy and momentum of the system, 
which are time independent since 8tQv = 0 following from 8"T"v = O. This symmetry 
35 

36 
Classical field theory 
(invariance of the theory under space-time translations) means that physics is independent 
of where in the universe you conduct your experiment. Noether's theorem tells us that this 
symmetry is why energy and momentum are conserved. 
By the way, the energy-momentum tensor defined this way is not necessarily symmetric. 
There is another way to derive the energy-momentum tensor, in general relativity. There, 
the metric g/1>V is a field, and we can expand it as g/1>V = 'TI/1>V + ..jGN h/1>l/' If you insert this 
expansion in a general relativistic action, the terms linear in h/1>l/ that couple to matter will 
have the form h/1>v T/1>v, This Tp,v is the energy-momentum tensor for matter, and is con-
served. The energy-momentum tensor defined by Eq. (3.35) is often called the canonical 
energy-momentum tensor. 
3.3.2 Currents 
Both the conserved vector J/1> associated with a global symmetry and the energy-
momentum tensor T/1>v are types of currents. The concept of a current is extremely useful 
for field theory. Currents are used in many ways. For example: 
1. Currents can be Noether currents associated with a symmetry. 
2. Currents can refer to external currents. These are given background configurations, such 
as electrons flowing through a wire. For example, a charge density p(x) with velocity 
Vi(X) has the cun'ent 
(3.37) 
3. Currents can be used as sources for fields, appearing in the Lagrangian as 
(3.38) 
This current can be the Noether current, an explicit external current such as the charge 
current above, or just a formal place-holder. The current is never a dynamical field; that 
is, it never has its own kinetic terms. We may include time dependence in J/1>(x, t), but 
we will not generally try to solve for the dynamics of J/1> at the same time as solving for 
the dynamics ofreal propagating fields such as Aw 
4. Currents can be place-holders for certain terms in a Lagrangian. For example, if our 
Lagrangian is 
£ = -~F;v - ¢*D¢ - ieA/1> (¢*8/1>¢ - ¢8/1>¢*)' 
we could write it as 
1 
2 
* 
£ = --F -'" D"' - A J 
4 
/1>1' 
'I-' 
'I-' 
/1> 
/1> 
(3.39) 
(3.40) 
with J/1> = ie (¢*8/1>¢ - ¢8/1>¢*)' The point of this use of currents is that it is indepen-
dent of the type of interaction. For example, A/1>J/1> could mean A/1> ~,/1>1/! , in which case 
we would have J/1> = ~,/1>1/!. This notation is particularly useful when we are only inter-
ested in the field A/1> itself, not in whether it was created by ¢ or 1/!. Using currents helps 
separate the problem into two halves: how the field ¢ or 1/! produces the field A/1> and 
then how A/1> affects other fields. Often we are interested in only half of the problem. 

3.4 Coulomb's law

-------------------------------------------...... 
3.4 Coulomb's law 
The best way to understand classical field theory is by doing some calculations. In this 
section we derive Coulomb's law using classical field theory. 
Start with a charge of strength e at the origin. This can be represented with an external 
current: 
The Lagrangian is 
{ 
Jo(x) = p(x) = eJ3(x), 
Ji(x) = O. 
1 
2 
£., = -4F1w - AI-'Jw 
To calculate the equations of motion, we first expand

2

2 
£., = -4(0I-'Av - ovAl-') - AI-'JI-' = -"2 (0l-'Av) + "2 (0l-'AI-') - AI-'JI-" 
and note that 
Then, the Euler-Lagrange equations :L - 01-' 8(t,,~v) = 0 imply 
- Jv - 0l-'( -0l-'Av) - ov( 0l-'AI-') = 0, 
which gives 
These are just Maxwell's equations in the presence of a source. 
Expanding out FI-'v we find 
Now choose Lorenz gauge, 0l-'AI-' = O. Then, 
which has a formal solution

(3.42) 
(3.43) 
(3.45) 
(3.46) 
(3.47) 
(3.48) 
(3.49) 
where tr just means the inverse of 0, which we will define more precisely soon. This type 
of expression comes about in almost every calculation in quantum field theory. It says that 
the Av field is determined by the source Jv after it propagates with the propagator 
1 
ITA = O· 
We will understand these propagators in great detail as we go along. 
(3.50) 

38 
Classical field theory 
For the particular source we are interested in, the point charge at the origin, Eq. (3.41), 
the equations of motion are 
Ai = 0, 
e 
3 
Ao(x) = Do (x). 
(3.51) 
(3.52) 
There are also homogeneous solutions for which OAJ.l = O. These are electromagnetic 
waves that do not have anything to do with our source, so we will ignore them for now. 
3.4.1 Fourier transform interlude 
Continuing with the Coulomb calculation, we next take the Fourier transform. Recall that 
the Fourier transform of a 0-function is just I: J (k) = 1. That is 
(3.53) 
Since the Laplacian is l::. = ai, we have 
Thus, we identify 
(3.55) 
This also works for Lorentz-invariant quantities: 
(3.56) 
(3.57) 
More generally, 
So, 
(3.59) 
Thus, in general, 
(3.60) 
We will use this implicitly all the time. For a field theorist, box means "-k2". 

3.5 Green's functions 
---------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.2 Coulomb potential 
------------------------------------~----------------------------
Since 03 (x) is time independent, our scalar potential simplifies to 
Ao(x) = a03(x) = - ~ 03(X). 
We can solve this equation in Fourier space:

If 0 > 0 then the pole at k = -io lies on the negative imaginary axis. For eikr we must 
close the contour up to get exponential decay at large k. This misses the pole, so this term 
gives zero. For e-ikr we close the contour down and get 
Thus, 
e 1 
Ao(x) = 41f;::' 
(3.64) 
(3.65) 
This result can also be derived through the m 
----7 0 limit of the potential for a massive 
vector boson, as in Problem 3.6. 
3.5 Green's functions 
The important point is that we found the Coulomb potential by using 
(3.66) 
Even if J M were much more complicated, producing all kinds of crazy-looking electromag-
netic fields, we could still use this equation. 
39 

40 
Classical field theory 
For example, consider the Lagrangian 
(3.67) 
where ¢ represents a charged object that radiates the A field. Now A's equation of motion 
is (in Lorenz gauge) 
(3.68) 
This is just what we had before but with JI" = ie (¢*0l"¢ - ¢0l"¢*). And again we will 
have AI" = 6Jw 
Using propagators is a very useful way to solve these types of equations, and quite gen-
eral. For example, let us suppose our Lagrangian had an interaction term such as A 3 in it. 
The Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field does not have such a term (electromagnetism 
is linear), but there are plenty of self-interacting fields in nature. The gluon is one. Another 
is the graviton. The Lagrangian for the graviton is heuristically 
£ = -~hDh + ~Ah3 + Jh 
23' 
(3.69) 
where h represents the gravitational potential, as Ao represents the Coulomb potential. We 
are ignoring spin and treating gravity as a simple scalar field theory. The h 3 term represents 
a graviton self-interaction, which is present in general relativity and so A rv VG N. The 
equations of motion are 
Dh - Ah2 - J = 0. 
(3.70) 
Now we solve perturbatively in A. For A = 0, 
(3.71) 
This is what we had before. Then we plug in 
(3.72) 
D(ho + hd - A(ho + hd2 - J = 0, 
(3.73) 
which implies 
(3.74) 
so that 
(3.75) 
Thus, the solution to order A is 
(3.76) 
We can keep this up, resulting in a nice expansion for h. 

3.5 Green's functions 
--
This is known as the Green's function method. The object 
1 
II=--o 
(3.77) 
is known as a 2-point Green's function or propagator. Propagators are integral parts of 
quantum field theory. Classically, they tell us how a field propagates through space when 
it is sourced by a current J (x). Note that the propagator has nothing to do with the source. 
In fact it is entirely determined by the kinetic terms for a field. 
It is not hard to be more precise about this expansion. We can define II = - tr as the 
solution to 
(3.78) 
where Ox = g/1>1/ a~" a~v . Up to some subtleties with boundary conditions, which will be 
addressed in future chapters, the solution is 
II( 
) = J d4k ik(x-y) ~ 
x,y 
(27r)4 e 
k2 ' 
(3.79) 
which is easy to check: 
o II(x y) = - J d
4
k eik(x-y) = -04(x - y) . 
x, 
(27r)4 
(3.80) 
Note that II(x, y) = II(y, x). 
Using OyII(x, y) = -04(X - y) we can then write a field as 
h(x) = J 
d4y 04(x - y) h(y) = - J 
d4y [OyII(x, y)] h(y) = - J 
d4y II(x, y) Oyh(y), 
(3.81) 
where we have integrated by parts in the last step. This lets us solve the free equation 
Oyho(y) = J(y) by inserting it on the right-hand side of this identity, to give 
ho(x) = - J 
d4yII(x,y) J(y). 
(3.82) 
The next term in the expansion is Eq. (3.74), whose more precise form is 
(3.83) 
Substituting again into Eq. (3.81) and combining with the leading-order result, we find 
h(x) = - J 
d4yII(x,y) J(y) 
+A J 
d4w J 
d4y J 
d4zII(x,w)II(w,y)II(w,z)J(y)J(Z)+O(A2), (3.84) 
which is what was meant by Eq. (3.76). 
There is a nice pictorial representation of this solution: 
x~J(Z) 
h(x)=x~J(Y) + 
+ ... 
J(y) 
(3.85) 
41 

42 
Classical field theory 
These are called Feynman diagrams. The rules for matching equations such as Eq. (3.84) 
to pictures like this are called Feynman rules. The Feynman rules for this classical field 
theory example are: 
I. Draw a point x and a line from x to a new point Xi. 
2. Either truncate a line at a source J or let the line branch into two lines adding a new 
point and a factor of A. 
3. Repeat previous step. 
4. The final value for h(x) is given by graphs up to some order in A with the ends capped 
by currents J(Xi), the lines replaced by propagators II(Xi' Xj), and all internal points 
integrated over. 
As we will see in Chapter 7, the Feynman rules for quantum field theory are almost 
identical, except that for n i- 0 lines can close in on themselves. 
Returning to our concrete example of classical gravity, these diagrams describe the way 
the Sun affects Mercury. The zigzag lines represent gravitons and the blobs on the right 
represent the source, which in this case is the Sun. Mercury, on the left, is also drawn as a 
blob, since it is classical. The first diagram represents Newton's potential, while the second 
diagram has the self-interaction in it, proportional to A cv VG N. You can use this pictorial 
representation to immediately write down the additional terms. Drawing the next-order 
picture translates immediately into an integral expression representing the next term in the 
perturbative solution for h( x). In this way, one can solve the equations of motion for a 
classical field by drawing pictures.

Old-fashioned perturbation theory 
The slickest way to perform a perturbation expansion in quantum field theory is with Feyn-
man diagrams. These diagrams will be the main tool we will use in this book, and we will 
derive the diagrammatic expansion in Chapter 7. Feynman diagrams, while having advan-
tages such as producing manifestly Lorentz-invariant results, can give a very unintuitive 
picture of what is going on. For example, they seem to imply that particles that cannot exist 
can appear from nowhere. Technically, Feynman diagrams introduce the idea that a particle 
can be off-shell, meaning not satisfying its classical equations of motion, for example, with 
p2 i- m 2 . They trade on-shellness for exact 4-momentum conservation. This conceptual 
shift was critical in allowing the efficient calculation of amplitudes in quantum field theory. 
In this chapter, we explain where off-shellness comes from, why you do not need it, but 
why you want it anyway. 
To motivate the introduction of the concept of off-shellness, we begin by using our 
second-quantized formalism to compute amplitudes in perturbation theory, just as in quan-
tum mechanics. Since we have seen that quantum field theory is just quantum mechanics 
with an infinite number of harmonic oscillators, the tools of quantum mechanics such 
as perturbation theory (time-dependent or time-independent) should not have changed. 
We will just have to be careful about using integrals instead of sums and the Dirac 
6-function instead of the Kronecker 6. So, we will begin by reviewing these tools and 
applying them to our second-quantized photon. This is called old-fashioned perturbation 
theory (OFPT). 
As a historical note, OFPT was still a popular way of doing calculations through at least 
the 1960s. Some physicists, such as Schwinger, never embraced Feynman diagrams and 
continued to use OFPT. It was not until the 1950s through the work of Dyson and others 
that it was shown that OFPT and Feynman diagrams gave the same results. Despite the 
prevalence of Feynman's approach in modern calculations, and the efficient encapSUlation 
by the path integral formalism (Chapters 14 and onward), OFPT is still worth understand-
ing. It provides complementary physical insight into quantum field theory. For example, a 
souped-up version of OFPT is given by Schwinger's proper-time formalism (Chapter 33), 
which is still the best way to do certain effective-action calculations. Also, OFPT is closely 
related to the reduction of loop amplitudes into sums over on-shell states using unitarity 
(see Section 24.1.2). 
This chapter can be skipped without losing continuity with the rest of the text. 

4.1 Lippmann-Schwinger equation 
47 
------------------------------------------------------------------
~-----
4.1 Lippmann-Schwinger equation 
Just as in quantum mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum field theory works by 
splitting the Hamiltonian up into two parts: 
H=Ho+V, 
(4.1) 
where the eigenstates of Ho are known exactly, and the potential V gives corrections that 
are small in some sense. The difference from quantum mechanics is that in quantum field 
theory the states often have a continuous range of energies. For example, in a hydrogen 
atom coupled to an electromagnetic field, the associated photon energies, E = Wk = Ikl, 
can take any values. Because of the infinite number of states, the methods look a little 
different, but we will just be applying the natural continuum generalization of perturbation 
theory in quantum mechanics. 
We are often interested in a situation where we know the state of a system at early times 
and would like to know the state at late times. Say the state has a fixed energy E at early 
and late times (of course, it is the same E). There will be some eigenstate of Ho with 
energy E, call it I¢). So, 
Hol¢) = EI¢) . 
(4.2) 
If the energies E are continuous, we should be able to find an eigenstate 11/J) of the full 
Hamiltonian with the same eigenvalue: 
HI1/J) = EI1/J) , 
(4.3) 
and we can formally write 
1 
11/J) = I¢) + E _ Ho VI1/J) , 
(4.4) 
which is trivial to verify by multiplying both sides by E - Ho. This is called the 
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. I The inverted object appearing in the Lippmann-
Schwinger equation is a kind of Green's function known as the Lippmann-Schwinger 
kernel: 
1 
IlLs = E - Ho 
(4.6) 
The Lippmann-Schwinger equation is useful in scattering theory (see Chapter 5). In 
scattering calculations the potential acts at intermediate times to induce transitions among 
states I¢) that are assumed to be free (non-interacting) at early and late times. It says 
the full wavefunction 11/J) is given by the free wavefunction I¢) plus a scattering term. 
I Formally, the inverse of E - Ho is not well defined. Since E is an eigenvalue of Ho , det(E - Ho) = 0 
and (E - HO) - l is singular. To regulate this singularity, we can add an infinitesimal imaginary factor iE, 
leading to 
11/J) = 11» + E 
~ +' VI1/J), 
-
0 
u" 
(4.5) 
with the understanding that c should be taken to zero at the end of the calculation. 

48 
Old-fashioned perturbation theory 
What we would really like to do is express 11P) entirely in terms of I¢). Thus, we define 
an operator T by 
VI1P) = TI¢) , 
(4.7) 
where T is known as the transfer matrix. Inserting this definition turns the Lippmann-
Schwinger equation into 
1 
11P) = I¢) + E _ Ha TI¢), 
(4.8) 
which formally gives 11P) in terms of I¢). Multiplying this by V and demanding the two 
sides be equal when contracted with any state (¢j I gives an operator equation for T: 
1 
T = V + V E _ Ha T. 
(4.9) 
We can then solve perturbatively in V to get 
1 
1 
1 
T = V+V 
V+V 
V 
V+··· 
E - Ha 
E - Ha 
E-Ha 
= V + V Ihs V + V Ihs V Ihs V + .... 
(4.10) 
If we insert the complete set I:j I¢j)(¢jl of eigenstates I¢j) of Ha, the matrix elements 
become 
1 
(¢iITI¢f) = (¢ilVl¢f) + (¢flV E _ Ha l¢j)(¢jlVl¢i) + .... 
(4.11) 
WritingTfi = (¢fITI¢i) and Vij = (¢ilVl¢j), this becomes 
Tfi = Vfi + Vfjlhs(j)Vji + Vfj1hs (j)VjI;;Ihs (k)Vl;;i + ... , 
(4.12) 
where Ihs(k) = E.!E
k
• Again, E = Ei = Ej is the energy of the initial and final state 
we are interested in. This expansion is old-fashioned perturbation theory. 
Equation (4.12) describes how a transition rate can be calculated in perturbation theory 
as a sum of ternlS. In each term the potential creates an intermediate state I ¢j) which 
propagates with the propagator Ihs (j) until it hits another potential, where it creates a 
new field I¢I;;) which then propagates and so on, until they hit the final potential factor, 
which transitions it to the final state. There is a nice diagrammatic way of drawing this 
series, called Feynman graphs, which we will see through an example in a moment and in 
more detail in upcoming chapters. The first term Vij gives the Born approximation (or 
first Born approximation), the second term, the second Born approximation and so on. See, 
for example, [Sakurai, 1993] for applications of the Lippmann-Schwinger approximation 
in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. 
4.1.1 Coulomb's law revisited 
The example we will compute is one we will revisit many times: an electron scattering off 
another electron. The transition matrix element for this process is given by the Lippmann-

Here, Ei is the initial energy (which is the same as the final energy), and En is the energy 
of the intermediate state. The initial and final states each have two electrons Ii) = 
1'1f!~'1f!~) 
and (f I = ('1f!~'1f!! I, where the superscripts label the momenta, i.e. '1f!~ has ih, etc. The 
intermediate state can be anything in the whole Fock space, but only certain intermediate 
states will have non-vanishing matrix elements with V. 
In relativistic field theory, the instantaneous action-at-a-distance of Coulomb's law is 
replaced by a process where two electrons exchange a photon that travels only at the speed 
of light. Thus, there should be a photon in the intermediate state. Ignoring the spin of 
the electrons and the photon, the interaction of the electrons with the photon field can be 
written as 
v = ~e J 
d3x'1f!e(x)¢(X)'1f!e(x). 
(4.14) 
This interaction is local, since the fields '1f!e (x) and ¢( x), corresponding to the electrons 
and photon, are all evaluated at the same point. The factor of ~ comes from ignoring spin 
and treating all fields as representing real scalar particles. 
This interaction can turn a state with an electron of momentum PI into a state with an 
electron of momentum P3 and a photon of momentum fir. Since initial and final states both 
have two electrons and no photons, the leading term in Eq. (4.13) vanishes, Vfi = O. 
To get a non-zero matrix element, we need an intermediate state In) with a photon. There 
are two intermediate states that can contribute. In the first, the photon is emitted from the 
first electron and the intermediate state is before that photon hits the second electron. We 
can draw a picture representing this process: 
(4.15) 
The vertical dashed line indicates the time at which the intermediate state is evaluated. The 
second electron feels the effect of a photon that the source, the first electron, emitted at an 
earlier time. We say that the electron states interact in this case through a retarded propa-
gator. For this retarded case, In) =1 '1f!~¢i'1f!~) where I¢i) is a photon state of momentum

Old-fashioned perturbation theory 
which requires v~t) = 
(1j!!¢'IVI1j!~/' In this case, from the second electron's point of 
view, the effect is felt before the source, the first electron, emitted the photon. The photon 
propagator in this case is called an advanced propagator. Obviously, which diagram is 
advanced or retarded depends on what we call the source, but either way there are two 
intermediate states, one with a retarded and the other with an advanced propagator. 
To find an expression for these matrix elements, we insert our field operators: 
V~~) = ~(1j!;¢'IVI1j!~1 = ~ J 
d3x(1j!;¢'I1j!e(x)¢(x)1j!e(x)I1j!~/'

with a similar form for the electron, and that 
(4.20) 
and similarly for other matrix elements. The interaction V( x) is a product of three fields, 
and one can pair either of the electron fields in V( x) with either of the electron states in 
evaluating

V~~) = e J

(4.21) 
The other matrix elements, v~t), and those involving the final state are similar, which you 
can verify. 
Thus, we have at first non-vanishing order: 
Tfi = J 
d3p, (27r)3 53 (PI - P3 - p,) (27r)3 53(P2 - P4 + f},) E- ~ E .

(4.22) 
These 5-functions tell us that 3-momentum is conserved in the local interactions between 
the photon and the electrons. Note that nothing tells us that energy is conserved; if it were, 
then En = Ei and this matrix element would blow up. This should not surprise you; the 
energy of intermediate states has always been different from the energy of the initial and 
final states in quantum mechanics - due to the uncertainty principle, energy can be not 
conserved for short times. 
To find a form for En, let us first denote the intermediate photon energy as E" the 
incoming electron energies EI and E 2 , and the outgoing electron energies E3 and E 4 . 
The momenta of the electrons are PI, P2, P3, P4 as above. By conservation of momentum, 
the photon momentum must be fJ,. = PI - P3. The photon energy is whatever it needs to 
be to put the photon on-shell: 0 = p; = E~ -
p~, so E, = If}, I. That is, 
(4.23) 
For Eq. (4.22), we need the intermediate state energy, which is different for retarded and 
advanced cases. 
In the retarded case the first electron emits the photon and we look at the state before 
the photon hits the second electron, as shown in the figure in Eq. (4.15). In this case, at the 

4.1 Lippmann-Schwinger equation 
--------------------------------------~--~----------------------
intermediate time the first electron is already in its final state, with energy E 3 . So the total 
intermediate state energy is 
(4.24) 
Dropping the 27r factors and the overall momentum-conserving 5-functions for clarity (we 
will give a detailed derivation of these factors and their connection to scattering cross 
sections in the relativistic theory in Chapter 5), we then find 
(4.25) 
In the advanced case, the second electron emits the photon and we look at the interme-
diate state before the photon hits the first electron, as in the diagram in Eq. (4.17). Then 
the energy is 
(4.26) 
and 
(4.27) 
Finally, we have to add the advanced and retarded contributions, since they are both valid 
intermediate states. Overall energy conservation says El + E2 = E3 + E 4 , so El - E3 = 
E4 - E2 == t::,.E. So the sum is

Note, this is not the photon momentum in Eq. (4.23) since E, = lfi-rl # t::,.E, or more 
simply, since k2 # O. But kl" is a Lorentz 4-vector, since it comprises an energy and a 
3-momentum. The norm of kl" is

The 2E, is related to normalization, which, along with the 27r and 5-function factors, will 
be properly accounted for in the relativistic treatment of the transfer matrix in the next 
chapter. 
The remarkable feature of Tfi is that it contains a Lorentz-invariant factor of k\. This 
-b = -d is the Green's function for a Lorentz-invariant theory. If one of the elec-
trons were at rest, we would sum the appropriate combination of momentum eigenstates, 
which would amount to Fourier transforming ~ to reproduce the Coulomb potential, as in 
Section 3.4.

Old-fashioned perturbation theory 
4.1.2 Feynman rules for OFPT 
Let us summarize some ingredients that went into the scattering calculation above: 
• All states are physical, that is, they are on-shell at all times. 
• Matrix elements Vij will vanish unless 3-momentum is conserved at each vertex. 
• Energy is not conserved at each vertex. 
These are the Feynman rules for old-fashioned perturbation theory.2 As mentioned in the 
introduction to this chapter, on-shell means that the state satisfies its free-field equations 
of motion. For example, a scalar field satisfying (0 + m 2)¢ = 0 would have p2 = m 2. It 
is called on-shell since j!2 = E2 - m 2 at fixed E and m is the equation for the surface of 
a sphere. So on-shell particles live on the shell of the sphere. 
Despite the fact that the intermediate states in OFPT are on-shell, we saw that it was 
helpful to write the answer in terms of a Lorentz 4-vector kl-' with k2 -=I- 0 representing 
the momentum of an unphysical, off-shell photon. We were led to kl-' by combining two 
diagrams with different temporal orderings, which we called advanced and retarded. 
It would be nice if we could get kl-' with just one diagram, where 4-momentum is con-
served at vertices and so propagators can be Lorentz invariant from the start. In fact we 
can! That is what we will be doing in the rest of the book. As we will see, there is just one 
propagator in this approach, the Feynman propagator, which combines the advanced and 
retarded propagators into one in a beautifully efficient way. So we will not have to keep 
track of what happens first. This new formalism will give us a much more cleanly organized 
framework to address the confusing infinities that plague quantum field theory calculations. 
Before finishing OFPT, as additional motivation and for its important historical relevance, 
we will heuristically review one such infinity. 
4.2 Early infinities 
Historically, one of the first confusions about the second-quantized photon field was that 
the Hamiltonian 
H = J (~:~3Wk (a!ak +~) 
(4.32) 
with Wk = Ikl seemed to imply that the vacuum has infinite energy, 
1 J d
3
k I ~ I 
Eo = (OIHIO) = "2 
(21r)3 
k = 00. 
(4.33) 
Fortunately, there is an easy way out of this paradoxical infinity: How do you measure 
the energy of the vacuum? You do not! Only energy differences are measurable, and in 
these differences the zero-point energy, the energy of the ground state, drops out. This is 
the basic idea behind renormalization - infinities can appear in intermediate calculations, 
2 The easiest way to derive these rules rigorously for a general scattering process, with the conventional relativis-
tic normalization, and with proper account of the if: in Eq. 4.5, is actually to start from the Lorentz-invariant 
Feynman rules we derive in Chapter 7. See [Sterman, 1993, Section 9.5] for more details. 

4.2 Early infinities 
------------------------------------------------------------------
but they must drop out of physical observables. This zero-point energy does have con-
sequences, such as the Casimir effect (Chapter 15), which comes from the difference in 
zero-point energies in different size boxes, and the cosmological constant problem, which 
comes from the fact that energy gravitates. We will come to understand these two examples 
in detail in Part III, but it makes more sense to start with some less exotic physics. 
In 1930, Oppenheimer thought to use perturbation theory to compute the shift of the 
energy of the hydrogen atom due to the photons [Oppenheimer, 1930]. He got infinity 
and concluded that QED was wrong. In fact, the result is not infinite but a finite calcu-
lable quantity known as the Lamb shift, which agrees perfectly with data. However, it is 
instructive to understand Oppenheimer's argument. 
4.2.1 Oppenheimer and the Lamb shift 
Using OFPT we would calculate the energy shift using 
6.En = (7PnIHintl7Pn) + L I (7P~H~t;m) 12 
m#n 
n 
m 
(4.34) 
This is the standard formula from time-independent perturbation theory. The basic problem 
is that we have to sum over all possible intermediate states l7Pm), including ones that have 
nothing much to do with the system of interest (for example, free plane waves). It is still 
true in field theory that there are only a finite number of states below any given energy 
level E, so that as E ---> 00, E .!En ---> O. The catch is that there are an infinite number of 
states, and their phase space density goes as J d3 k rv E 3 , so that you get E ~~n ---> 00 and 
perturbation theory breaks down. This is exactly what Oppenheimer found. 
First, take something where the calculation makes sense, such as a fixed non-dynamical 
background field. Say there is an electric field in the z direction. Then the potential energy 
is proportional to the electric field: 
Hint = eE . X = elElz. 
(4.35) 
This interaction produces the linear Stark effect, which is a straightforward application of 
time-independent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. Our discussion of the Stark 
effect here will be limited to a quick demonstration that it is finite, and a representation of 
the result in terms of diagrams. 
Since an atom has no electric dipole moment, the first-order correction is zero: 
(4.36) 
At second order: 
II 
(4.37) 
The picture on the right side of this equation is the corresponding Feynman diagram: the 
-=- symbols represent the electric field which sources photons that interact with the elec-
tron (more general background-field calculations will be discussed in Chapters 33 and 34); 
the electron is represented as the solid line on the bottom; the points where the photon 
meets the electron correspond to matrix elements of Hint; finally, the line between the 
53

Old-fashioned perturbation theory 
two photon insertions is the electron propagator, the Eo!E-m factor in the second-order 
expression for t::.Eo. 
To show that t::.Eo is finite, we assume that Eo < 0 without loss of generality and that 
Em > El > Eo so that Eo is the ground state. Since t::.Eo < 0, by Eq. (4.37), we need to 
show that t::.Eo is bounded from below. Using the completeness relation 
(4.38) 
m 2:0 
m>O 
we have 
(4.39) 
The right-hand side of this equation is a positive number, thus t::.Eo is bounded from below 
and above (by 0) and hence the energy correction to the ground state is finite. While it is 
not hard to calculate t::.Eo exactly for a given system, such as the hydrogen atom, the only 
thing we want to observe here is that t::.Eo is finite. 
Now, instead of an external electric field, what would happen if this field were produced 
by the electron itself? Then we need to allow for the creation of photons by the electron and 
their annihilation back into the electron, which can be described with our second-quantized 
photon field. The starting Hamiltonian, for which we know the exact eigenstates, now has 
two parts: 
(4.40) 
with energy eigenstates given by electron wavefunctions associated with a set of pho-
tons, so 
(4.41) 
where we allow for any number of excitations nk of the photons of any momenta k. 
At second order in perturbation theory, only one photon can be created and destroyed, 
but we have to integrate over this photon's momentum. We are interested in the integration 
region where the photon has a very large momentum. By momentum conservation in OFPT, 
since the ground state only has support for small momentum, the excited state of the atom 
must have large momentum roughly backwards to that of the photon, p rv -k. Thus, the 
excited state wavefunction will approach that of a free plane wave. The excited state energy 
is E ;::::: 1P1 + Ikl and so at large k the integral will be

After evaluating the x integral to get 83 (p - k) and then the p integral, we find

Problems 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This means that there should be an infinite shift in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. 
oppenheimer also showed that if you take the difference between two levels, relevant for 
the shift in spectral lines, the result is also divergent. He concluded, "It appears improbable 
that the difficulties discussed in this work will be soluble without an adequate theory of the 
masses of the electron and proton; nor is it certain that such a theory will be possible on 
the basis of the special theory of relativity" [Oppenheimer, 1930, p. 477]. 
What went wrong? In the Stark effect calculation we only had to sum over excited elec-
tron states, through 2.:m>O I ?jim) (?jim I in Eq. (4.39), which was finite. For the Lamb shift 
calculation, the sum was also over photon states, which was divergent. It diverged because 
the phase space for photons, d3 k, is larger than the suppression, If I ' due to the energies 
of the intermediate excited states. In terms of Feynman diagrams, the difference is that in 
the latter case we do not consider interactions with a fixed external field, but integrate over 
dynamical fields, corresponding to intermediate state photons. Since the photons relevant 
to the (?jio I Hint I ?jim ; lk) matrix element are the same as the photons relevant to the second, 
(?jim; 1 k I Hint l?jio) matrix element, the photon lines represent the same state and should be 
represented by a single line. Thus the diagram contracts, 
!J.Eo = II 
(4.44) 
and the Stark effect diagram becomes a loop diagram for the Lamb shift. These pictures 
are just shorthand for the perturbation expansion. The loop means that there is an unknown 
momentum, k, over which we have to integrate. Momentum must be conserved, but it can 
split between the atom and the photon in an infinite number of ways. 
There was actually nothing wrong with Oppenheimer's calculation. He did get the 
answer that OFPT predicts. What he missed was that there are other infinities that even-
tually cancel this infinity (for example, the electron mass is infinite too, so in fact his 
conclusion was on the right track). This discussion was really just meant as a preview to 
demonstrate the complexities we will be up against. To sort out all these infinities, it will 
be really helpful, but not strictly necessary, to have a formalism that keeps the symme-
tries, in particular Lorentz invariance, manifest along the way. Although Schwinger was 
able to tame the infinities using OFPT, his techniques were not for everyone. In his own 
words, "Like the silicon chips of more recent years, the Feynman diagram was bringing 
computation to the masses" [Brown and Hoddesdon, 1984, p. 329].

Cross sections and decay rates 
The twentieth century witnessed the invention and development of collider physics as an 
efficient way to determine which particles exist in nature, their properties, and how they 
interact. In early experiments, such as Ruthelford's discovery of the nucleus in 1911 using 
a -particles or Anderson's discovery of the positron in 1932 from cosmic rays, the colliding 
particles came from nature. Around 1931, E. O. Lawrence showed that particles could be 
accelerated to relativistic velocities in the lab, first through a 4-inch cyclotron, which gave 
protons 80000 electronvolts of kinetic energy, soon to go up to around 1 million electron-
volts. The Large Hadron Collider can collide beams of protons with 7 trillion electronvolts 
of energy. Colliders provide a great way to study fundamental interactions because they 
begin with initial states of essentially fixed momenta, i.e. plane waves, and end up with 
final states, which also have fixed momenta. By carefully measuring the mapping from 
initial state momenta to final state momenta, one can then compare to theoretical models, 
such as those of quantum field theory. 
Quantum mechanics consists of an elaborate collection of rules for manipulating states 
in a Hilbert space. The experimentally measurable quantities that are predicted in quan-
tum mechanics are differential probabilities. These probabilities are given by the modulus 
squared of inner products of states. We can write such inner products as (1; t I Ii; ti), where 
Ii; ti) is the initial state we start with at time ti and (1; tIl is the final state we are inter-
ested in at some later time t I' Since quantum field theory is just quantum mechanics with 
lots of fields, the experimental quantities we will be able to predict are also of the form 
1(1; tIli; tiW, 
The notation (1; t I Ii; ti) refers to the Schrodinger picture representation, where the 
states evolve in time. In the Heisenberg picture, which will be the default picture for quan-
tum field theory, we leave the states alone and put all the time evolution into an operator. In 
the special case where we evolve momentum eigenstates from t = -00 to t = +00, rele-
vant for collider physics applications, we give the time-evolution operator a special name: 
the scattering or S-matrix. The S-matrix is defined as 
(1IS li)Heisenberg = (1; 00 I i; -OO)Schrodinger . 
(5.1) 
The S-matrix has all the information about how the initial and final states evolve in time. 
Quantum field theory will tell us how to calculate S-matrix elements. As we will explain 
in this chapter and the next, the S-matrix is defined assuming that all of the things that 
change the state (the interactions) happen in a finite time interval, so that at asymptotic 
times, t = ±oo, the states are free of interactions. Free states at t = ±oo are known as 
asymptotic states. 

5.1 Cross sections 
57 
---
The number of particles scattered classically is proportional to the cross-sectional area of _#.,_ 
the scattering object. 
S-matrix elements are the primary objects of interest for high-energy physics. In this 
chapter, we will relate S-matrix elements to scattering cross sections, which are directly 
measured in collider experiments. We will also derive an expression for decay rates, which 
are also straightforward to measure experimentally. Quantum field theory is capable of cal-
culating other quantities besides S-matrix elements, such as thermodynamic properties of 
condensed matter systems. However, since the tools we develop for S-matrix calculations, 
such as Feynman rules, are also relevant for these applications, it is logical to focus on 
S-matrix elements for concreteness. 
5.1 Cross sections 
A cross section is a natural quantity to measure experimentally. For example, Rutherford 
was interested in the size '(" of an atomic nucleus. By colliding a-particles with gold foil and 
measuring how many a-particles were scattered, he could determine the cross-sectional 
area, 0" = 
7['("2, of the nucleus. Imagine there is just a single nucleus. Then the cross-
sectional area is given by 
0" = --:-____ 
n~lm-ll-:) e-I-
· o--:f_· p:...a_I_"t-:-k_l_es_s_c_a_t_tG..,.r_e_d_--o:-:--_ = ~ ~ N 
tim 
[beam 
T~ , 
(5.2) 
where T is the time for the experiment and ~ is the incoming flux (~ = number density x 
velocity of beam) and N is the number of particles scattered. This is shown in Figure 5.1. 
In a real gold foil experiment, we would also have to include additional factors for 
the number density of protons in the foil and the cross-sectional area of the beam if it 
is smaller than the size of the foil. These factors, like the flux and time factors in Eq. (5.2), 
depend on the details of how the experiment is actually performed. In contrast, the number 
of scatterings, N, is determined completely by the short-distance interactions among the 
particles. 
It is also natural to measure the differential cross section, dO" / dO, which gives the num-
ber of scattered particles in a certain solid angle dO. Classically, this gives us information 
about the shape of the object or form of the potential off of which the a-particles are 
Scattered.

In quantum mechanics, we generalize the notion of cross-sectional area to a cross sec-
tion, which still has units of area, but has a more abstract meaning as a measure of the 
interaction strength. While classically an a-particle either scatters off the nucleus or it 
does not scatter, quantum mechanically it has a probability for scattering. The classical 
differential probability is P = N~,c' where N is the number of particles scattering into a 
given area and Nine is the number of incident particles. So the quantum mechanical cross 
section is then naturally

da = --dP

) 
(5.3) 
where if> is the flux, now normalized as if the beam has just one particle, and P is now 
the quantum mechanical probability of scattering. The differential quantities da and dP 
are differential in kinematical variables, such as the angles and energies of the final state 
particles. The differential number of scattering events measured in a collider experiment is 
dN = Lx da, 
(5.4) 
where L is the luminosity, which is defined by this equation. 
In practice, experimental data are presented as the di.fferential number of events seen 
for a given integrated luminosity. For example, Figure 5.2 shows the cross section for 
final states with four leptons (more precisely, four muons, four electrons, or two muons 
and two electrons) from colliding proton initial states, as measured by the ATLAS col-
laboration at the Large Hadron Collider. The cross section shown is differential in the

invariant mass ofthe four leptons (m41 = V (P1 + P2 + P3 + p4 )2). Each point on the plot 
shoWS the number of events where the measured mass fell inside the given 2.5 GeV inter-
val. As indicated on the figure, the data plotted correspond to an integrated luminosity of 
Lint = J L dt = 25.3 fb -1 combined from a 7 Te V and an 8 Te V run. To compare to these 
data, one would calculate dr;;:41 using quantum field theory at the two energies, multiply by 
the appropriate luminosities, and add the resulting distributions. This final state can come 
from Z-boson pair production, top-quark pair production, Z-boson plus jet production or 
Biggs-boson production, as the solid histograms show. The sum of the contributions agrees 
very well with the data if the Higgs boson is included. 
NoW let us relate the formula for the differential cross section to S-matrix elements. 
From a practical point of view it is impossible to collide more than two particles at a time, 
thuS we can focus on the special case of S-matrix elements where Ii) is a two-particle state. 
$0, we are interested in the differential cross section for the 2 ----7 n process: 
(5.5) 
In the rest frame of one of the colliding particles, the flux is just the magnitude of the 
velocity of the incoming particle divided by the total volume: <I> = lvi/V. In a different 
frame, such as the center-of-mass frame, beams of particles come in from both sides, and 
the flux is then determined by the difference between the particles' velocities. So, <I> 
1V1 - V21/V. This should be familiar from classical scattering. Thus,

such a convention would not be Lorentz invariant. Instead, in Chapter 2 we defined

Now let us turn to the S-matrix element UISli) in the numerator ofEq. (5.7). We usually 
calculate S-matrix elements perturbatively. In a free theory, where there are no interactions, 
the S-matrix is simply the identity matrix ]. We can therefore write 
S =] +iT, 
(5.16) 
where T is called the transfer matrix and describes deviations from the free theory.2 
Since the S-matrix should vanish unless the initial and final states have the same total 
4-momentum, it is helpful to factor an overall momentum-conserving o-function: 
(5.17) 
Here, 04 (I;p) is shorthand for 04( I;pr - I;Pf) , where pr are the initial particles' momenta 
and Pf are the final particles' momenta. In this way, we can focus on computing the non-
trivial part of the S-matrix, M . In quantum field theory, "matrix elements" usually means 
UIMli). Thus we have 
(5.18) 
Now, it might seem worrisome at first that we need to take the square of a quantity with 
a o-function. However, this is actually simple to deal with. When integrated over, one of 
2 The i in this definition is just a convention, moti vated by S "" eiT, which makes T Hermitian if S is unitary. 
Note that T defined by Eq. (5.16) is not exactly T and does not have to be Hermitian. Hermiticity of Twill 
play an important role in implications of unitarity, discussed in Chapter 24.

dlhIPS is Lorentz invariant in Problem 5.2. 
Putting everything together, we have 
(5.22) 
All the factors of V and T have dropped out, so now it is trivial to take V ---+ 00 and 
T ---+ 00. Recall also that velocity is related to momentum by iJ = iljpo. 
5.1.1 Decay rates 
A differential decay rate is the probability that a one-particle state with momentum Pl turns 
into a multi-particle state with momenta {pj} over a time T: 
dr = ~dP' 
(5.23) 
Of course, it is impossible for the incoming particle to be an asymptotic state at -00 if it is 
to decay, and so we should not be able to use the S-matrix to describe decays. The reason 
this is not a problem is that we calculate the decay rate in perturbation theory assuming 
the interactions happen only over a finite time T. Thus, a decay is really just like a 1 ---+ n 
scattering process. 
Following the same steps as for the differential cross section, the decay rate can be 
Written as

Note that this is the decay rate in the rest frame of the particle. If the particle is moving 
at relativistic velocities, it will decay much slower due to time dilation. The rate in the 
boosted frame can be calculated from the rest-frame decay rate using special relativity.

5.2 Non-relativistic limit 
In the non-relativistic limit, our formula for the cross section should reduce to the usual 
formula from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. To see this, consider the case where an 
electron ¢e of mass 111e scatters off a proton ¢p of mass 111p. From non-relativistic quantum 
mechanics, the cross section should be given by the Born approximation: 
(5.34) 
where the Fourier transform of the potential is given by 
(5.35) 
and k is the difference in the electron momentum before and after scattering, sometimes 
called the momentum transfer. For example, if this is a Coulomb potential, V (x) = 
4:~xl' 
~ ~ 
2 
then V(k) = f2 so 
(5.36) 
Let us check the mass dimensions in these formulas (see Appendix A). [V(x)] = 1, 
so [if (k)] = - 2 and then [( ~~ ) Born] = - 2, which is the correct dimension for a cross 
section. 
For the field theory version, the center-of-mass frame is the proton rest frame to a good 
approximation and ECM = 111p. Also, the scattering is elastic, so Ipil = Ipfl. Then, the 
prediction is 
(5.37) 

64 
Cross sections and decay rates 
What dimension should M have? Since [~~] = -2 and [m;2] = -2, it follows that M 
should be dimensionless. 
If we ignore spin, we will see in Chapter 9 (Eqn. (9.11)) that the Lagrangian describing 
the interaction between the electron, proton and photon has the form 
£ = -~F;v - ¢~(D + m;)¢e - ¢;(D + m;)¢p 
-
ieA~(¢~o~¢e -
¢~O~¢e) + ieA~(¢;o~¢p -
¢;o~¢p) + O(e2 ), 
(5.38) 
with ¢e and ¢p representing the electron and proton respectively. (This is the Lagrangian 
for scalar QED.) 
In the non-relativistic limit, the momentum p~ = (E, PJ is close to being at rest (m, 0). 
So, E rv m, that is, Ot¢ rv im¢ and 1P1 « m. Let us use this to factorize out the leading-
order time dependence, ¢e ---4 ¢eeimet and ¢p ---4 ¢peimpt. Then the Lagrangian becomes 
£ = -~F~v + ¢~V2¢e + 2emeAo¢:¢e + ¢;V2¢p - 2empAo¢;¢p +"', 
(5.39) 
- 2 
with ... higher order in :2' We have removed all the time dependence, which is 
appropriate because we are trying to calculate a static potential. 
Although we do not know exactly how to calculate the matrix element, by now we are 
capable of guessing the kinds of ingredients that go into the calculation. The matrix element 
must have a piece propOltional to -2emp from the interaction between the proton and the 
photon, a factor of the propagator f2 from the photon kinetic term, and a piece proportional 
to 2eme from the photon interacting with the electron. Thus,

which agrees with Eq. (5.36) and so the non-relativistic limit works. We will perform this 
calculation again carefully and completely, without asking you to accept anything without 
proof, once we derive the perturbation expansion and Feynman rules. The answer will be 
the same.

which has the usual ~ 
for the kinetic term and an interaction with just a charge e and no 
mass m in the coupling. Of course, the final result is independent of the normalization, but 
it is still helpful to see how relativistic and non-relativistic normalization conventions are 
related. Note that, since in the non-relativistic limit vk = k, this rescaling is closely 
related to the normalization factors ~ 
we added by convention to the definition of the 
y2wp 
quantum field. 

65 
5.3 e+e- ---+ p,+p,- with spin 
-------------------------~-------------...... 
So far, we have approximated everything, electrons and protons, as being spinless. This 
is a good first approximation, as the basic ~ form of Coulomb's law does not involve 
spin - it follows from flux conservation (Gauss's law) or, more simply, from dimensional 
analysis. In Chapter 10, we will understand the spin of the electron and proton using the 
Dirac equation and spinors. While spinors are an extremely efficient way to encode spin 
information in a relativistic setting, it is also important to realize that relativistic spin can 
be understood the same way as for non-relativistic scattering. 
In this section we will do a simple example of calculating a matrix element with spin. 
Consider the process of electron-positron annihilation into muon-antimuon pairs (this pro-
cess will be considered in more detail in Section 13.3 and Chapter 20). The electron does 
not interact with the muon directly, only through the electromagnetic force (and the weak 
force). The leading-order contribution should then come from a process represented by 
(5.43) 
This diagram has a precise meaning, as we will see in Chapter 7, but for now just think of 
it as a pictorial drawing of the process: the e+ e- annihilate into a virtual photon, which 
propagates along, then decays into a p,+ p,- pair. 
Let us get the dimensional part out of the way first. The propagator we saw in Chapters 3 
and 4 (see Eqs. (3.79) and (4.31)) gives -b, where kl" = pi + pi = pj + pt is the off-
shell photon momentum. For a scattering process, such as e-p+ ---+ e-p+, this propagator 
k\ gives the scattering potential. For this annihilation process, it is much simpler; in the 
center-of-mass frame k12 = eJ-, which is constant (if ECM is constant). By dimensional 
CM 
analysis, M should be dimensionless. The eJ- is in fact canceled by factors of V2El = 
CM 
v2E2 = V2E3 = V2E4 = VECM, which come from the (natural, non-relativistic) 
normalization of the electron and muon states. Thus, all these ECM factors cancel and M 
is just a dimensionless number, given by the appropriate spin projections. 
So, the only remaining part of M is given by projections of initial spins onto the 
intermediate photon polarizations, and then onto final spins. We can write 
(5.44) 
where 81 and 82 are the spins of the incoming states, 83 and 84 the spins of the outgoing 
states, and E is the polarization of the intermediate photon. 
Let us now try to guess the form of these spin projections by using angular momentum. 
This is easiest to do in the center-of-mass frame. At ultra-relativistic energies, we can 

66 
Cross sections and decay rates 
neglect the electron and muon masses. Then, with some choice of direction z, the incoming 
e- and e+ momenta are 
pi = (E, 0, 0, E) , 
p~ = (E,O,O, - E). 
(5.45) 
Next, we will use that the electron is spin ~. In the non-relativistic limit, we usually think 
of the spin states as being up and down. In the relativistic limit, it is better to think of the 
electron as being polarized, just like a photon. Polarizations for spin- ~ particles are usually 
called helicities (helicity will be defined precisely in Section 11.1). We can use either a 
basis of circular polarization (called left and right helicity) or a basis of linear polarizations. 
Linearly polarized electrons are like linearly polarized light, and the polarizations must be 
transverse to the direction of motion. So the electron moving in the z direction can either 
be polarized in the y direction or in the x direction. So there are four possible initial states: 
Next, we use that the photon has spin 1 and two polarizations (this will be derived 
in Chapter 8). To get spin 1 from spin ~ and spin ~, the electron and positron have to 
be polarized in the same direction. Thus, only the first two initial states could possibly 
annihilate into a photon. Since the electron polarization is perpendicular to its momentum, 
the photon polarization will be in either the x or y direction as well. The two possible 
resulting photon polarizations are 
fl = (0,1,0,0), 
E2 = (0,0,1,0). 
(5.47) 
Both of these polarizations are produced by the e+ e- annihilation: I +-H--» produces fl 
and 111) produces f2. 
Next, the muon and antimuon are also spin ~ so the final state has four possible spin 
states too. Similarly, only two of them can have non-zero overlap with the spin-l photon. 
However, the p,+ and p,- are not going in the z direction. Their momenta can be written as 
pj = E(I , 0, sine, cos e), 
p~ = E(I, 0, - sine, - cos e), 
(5.48) 
where e is the angle to the e+ e- axis. There is also an azimuthal angle ¢ about the z axis, 
which we have set to 0 since the problem has cylindrical symmetry. So in this case the two 
possible directions for the photon polarization are 
EI = (0,1,0,0), 
E2 = (O,O,cose,-sine). 
(5.49) 
You can check that these are orthogonal to pj and p~. 
Now say we do not measure the final muon spins. Then the matrix element is given by 
summing over all possible intermediate polarizations f and final state spins 83 and 84 for a 
particular initial state. Then there are only two non-vanishing possibilities: 
MI = M (I f--H--+) ---+ If)) = EIEI + f l E2 = -1, 
M2 = M(ll1) ---+ If)) = f2EI + f2E2 = - cose. 
(5.50) 
(5.51) 
If our initial beams are unpolarized, we should average over initial spins too. This gives

As discussed in Chapter 5, scattering experiments have been a fruitful and efficient way 
to determine the particles that exist in nature and how they interact. In a typical collider 
experiment, two particles, generally in approximate momentum eigenstates at t = - 00, 
are collided with each other and we measure the probability of finding particular outgoing 
momentum eigenstates at t = +00. All of the interesting interacting physics is encoded in 
how often given initial states produce given final states, that is, in the S-matrix. 
The working assumption in scattering calculations is that all of the interactions happen in 
some finite time - T < t < T. This is certainly true in real collider scattering experiments. 
But more importantly, it lets us make the problem well defined; if there were always inter-
actions, it would not be possible to set up our initial states at t = -00 or find the desired 
final states at t = +00. Without interactions at asymptotic times, the states we scatter can 
be defined as on-shell one-palticle states of given momenta, known as asymptotic states. 
In this chapter, we derive an expression for the S-matrix using only that the system is free 
at asymptotic times. In Chapter 7 we will work out the Feynman rules, which make it easy 
to perform a perturbation expansion for the interacting theory. 
The main result of this chapter is a derivation of the LSZ (Lehmann-Symanzik-
Zimmermann) reduction formula, which relates S-matrix elements (fISli) for n 
asymptotic momentum eigenstates to an expression involving the quantum fields ¢(x): 
UISli) = [i J 
d4xle-iP1Xl(o+m2)] .,. [i J 
d4xneiPnXn(O + m2)] 
X (nIT{ ¢(Xl) ¢(X2) ¢(X3)'" ¢(xn)}ln), 
(6.1) 
with the - i in the exponent applying for initial states and the +i for final states. In this 
formula, T {- . . } refers to a time-ordered product, to be defined below, and In) is the 
ground state or vacuum of the interacting theory, which in general may be different from 
the vacuum in a free theory. 
The time-ordered correlation function in this formula can be very complicated and 
encodes a tremendous amount of information besides S-matrix elements. The factors of 
0+ m2 project onto the S-matrix: 0 + m2 becomes _p2 + m2 in Fourier space, which 
vanishes for the asymptotic states. These factors will therefore remove all terms in the 
time-ordered product except those with poles of the form p2 !m2 , corresponding to prop-
agators of on-shell particles. Only the terms with poles for each factor of p2 - m 2 will 
• 
69 

70 
The S-matrix and time-ordered products 
survive, and the S -matrix is given by the residue of these poles. Thus, the physical content 
of the LSZ formula is that the S-matrix projects out one-particle asymptotic states from 
the time-ordered product of fields. 
6.1 The LSZ reduction formula 
In Chapter 5, we derived a formula for the differential cross section for 2 -; n scattering 
of asymptotic states, Eq. (5.22): 
1 
2 
da = (2E 1)(2E2)lih _ v211MI dllLIPS , 
(6.2) 
where dlhIPS is the Lorentz-invariant phase space, and M, which is shorthand for 
UIM Ii), is the S-matrix element with an overall momentum-conserving o-function 
factored out: 
(6.3) 
The state Ii) is the initial state at t = -00, and UI is the final state at t = +00. More 
precisely, using the operators at(t), which create particles with momentum p at time t, 
these states are 
Ii) = V2w1\/2w2 a11( - 00) ah2( -oo)ln), 
where In) is the ground state, with no particles, and 
If) = V 2W3'" V2wn aL(oo)'" a1joo)ln). 
(6.4) 
(6.5) 
We are generally interested in the case where some scattering actually happens, so let us 
assume If) i=- Ii), in which case the 1l does not contlibute. Then the S-matrix is 
UISli) = 2n / 2 .jwjW 2W3" ·wn (nlap3(00)," ap,,(oo) ahl( -00) ah2( -oo)ln). 
(6.6) 
This expression is not tenibly useful as is. We would like to relate it to something we can 
compute with our Lorentz-invariant quantum fields ¢( x ). 
Recall that we defined the fields as a sum over creation and annihilation operators: 
¢(x) = ¢(x, t) = J (d
3p
)3 ~ 
[ap(t)e- iPX + ah(t)eipx] , 
(6.7) 
27r 
V 2wp 
where wp = \/P + m 2 . We also start to use the notation ¢(x) = ¢(x, t) as well, 
for simplicity. These are Heisenberg picture operators which create states at some par-
ticular time. However, the creation and annihilation operators at time t are in general 
different from those at some other time t'. An interacting Hamiltonian will rotate the 
basis of creation and annihilation operators, which encodes all the interesting dynam-
ics. For example, if H is time independent, ap(t) = eiH(t- to)ap(to) e-iH(t- to), just as 
¢(x) = eiH(t- to)¢(x, to) e-iH(t-to), where to is some arbitrary reference time where we 
have matched the interacting fields onto the free fields. We will not need to use anything at 
all in this section about ap(t) and ¢(x, t) except that these operators have some ability to

annihilate fields at asymptotic times: (Sl l<t>(x, t = ±oo)lp) = Ceixp for some constant C,

(6.8) 
where pl1- = (wp, PJ. To derive this, we only need to assume that all the interesting dynam-
ics happens in some finite time interval, -T < t < T, so that the theory is free at t = ±oo; 
no assumption about the form of the interactions during that time is necessary. 
To prove Eq. (6.8), we will obviously have to be careful about boundary conditions at 
t = ±oo. However, we can safely assume that the fields die off at x = ±oo, allowing us to 
integrate by parts in x. Then, 
i J 
d4x eipx(O + m2 )<t>(x) = i J 
d4x eipx(o; - 8; + m2 )<t>(x) 
= i J 
d4x eipx(o; + tf2 + m2)<t>(x) 
= i J 
d4x eipx(o; + w;)<t>(x). 
(6.9) 
Note this is true for any kind of <t>(x), whether classical field or operator. Also, 
at [eiPX(iot +wp) <t>(x)] = (iwpeipx(iOt +wp) +eipX(io; +WpOt)] <t>(x) 
= ieipX(o; + w;)<t>(x), 
(6.10) 
which holds independently of boundary conditions. So, 
i J 
d4x eipx(O + m2)<t>(x) = J 
d4x at [eipX (iot + Wp)<t>(x)] 
= J 
dt at [eiwpt J 
d3x e-ipx (iot + WP)<t>(x)]. 
(6.11) 
Again, this is true for whatever kind of crazy interaction field <t>( x) might be. 
This integrand is a total derivative in time, so it only depends on the fields at the boundary 
t = ±oo. By construction, our ap(t) and at(t) operators are time independent at late and 
early times. For the particular case of <t>(x) being a quantum field, Eq. (6.7), we can do the 
x integral: 
Here we used Otak (t) = 0, which is nottrue in general, but true att = ±oo where the fields 
are free, which is the only region relevant to Eq. (6.11). The x integral gives a 03 (p - k)

The S-matrix and time-ordered products 
in the first term and a <53 (ji + k) in the second term. Either way, it forces Wk = wp and so 
we get 
Thus, 
i J 
d4x eipX(D + m2)¢(x) = J 
dt ad(eiwpt ) (y2W;ap(t)e-iwpt)] 
= J2wp [ap(oo) - ap(-oo)], 
which is what we wanted. Similarly (by taking the Hermitian conjugate), 
y2W; [a~(oo) - a~( -00)] = -i J 
d4x e- ipX(D + m2)¢(x). 
Now we are almost done. We wanted to compute 
(6.13) 
(6.14) 
(6.15) 
(6.16) 
and we have an expression for ap(oo) - ap(-oo). Note that all the initial states have at 
operators and - 00, and the final states have ap operators and +00, so the operators are 
already in time order: 
UISli) = V2nWl ... Wn (DIT {ap3 (00) .. . apn (00 )a~l ( - 00) a~2 (-oo)} 1.(1) ) (6.17) 
where the time-ordering operation T { ... } indicates that all the operators should be 
ordered so that those at later times are always to the left of those at earlier times. That is, 
T { ... } just manhandles the operators within the brackets, placing them in order regardless 
of whether they commute or not. 
Time ordering lets us write the S-matrix element as 
UISli) = V2nWl" .wn(DIT{[ap3 (00) - ap3(-00)]··· [apn(oo) - apn(-oo)] 
x [atl( -00) - ahl (00 )][a~2( - 00) -
a~2 (oo)]} 1.(1). 
(6.18) 
The time ordering migrates all the unwanted at (00) operators associated with the initial 
states to the left, where they annihilate on (fl, and all the unwanted a( -(0) operators to 
the right, where they annihilate Ii). Then there is no ambiguity in commuting the at, (00) 
past the apj (00) and everything we do not want drops out of this expression.l 
The result is then 
(P3 "'Pn ISlpIP2) = [i J 
d4xle-iPlXl(Dl +m2)] ... [i J 
d4xneiPnXn(Dn +m2)] 
x (DIT{¢(xl)¢(x2)¢(x3)'" ¢(xn)}ID) , (6.l9) 
where Di = (k 'f, which agrees with Eg. (6.1).2 This is the LSZ reduction formula. 
1 The only subtlety is when some momenta are identical, which would correspond to forward scattering. This 
ambiguity can be resolved by a careful consideration of the T --+ 00 limit; the result is the same as the analytic 
continuation of the case when all momenta are different. 
2 Pulling the 0 factors through the time-ordering operator is technically not allowed. However, as we will see in 
the next chapter, the effect of doing this is to introduce contact terms that do not contribute to the S-matrix. 

6.1 The LSZ reduction formula 
73 
____ 
------------------------------------------- ... 
EB .. 
6.1.1 Discussion 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The LSZ reduction says that to calculate an S-matrix element, multiply the time-ordered 
roduct of fields by some 0 + m 2 factors and Fourier transform. If the fields ¢ (x) were 
rree fields, they would satisfy (0 + m 2 )¢(x, t) = 0 and so the (Oi + m 2 ) terms would 
ive zero. However, as we will see, when calculating ampJiLUde. there will be factors of 
~ropagators O;m2 for the one-particle stales. These bl w up a. (0 + m 2 ) --'> O. The LSZ 
formula guarantees that the zeros and infinilies in the: c terms cancel, leaving a non-zero 
result. Moreover, the 0 + m 2 terms will kill anything that does not have a divergence, that 
will be anything but the exact initial and final state we want.3 That is the whole point of 
the LSZ formula: it isolates the asymptotic states by adding a carefully constructed zero to 
cancel everything that does not correspond to the state we want. 
It is easy to think that LSZ is totally trivial, but it is not. The projections are the only 
thing that tells us what the initial states are (the things created from the vacuum at t = -(0) 
and what the final states are (the things that annihilate into the vacuum at t = +(0). 
Initial and final states are distinguished by the ±i in the phase factors. The time ordering 
is totally physical: all the creation of the initial states happens before the annihilation of 
the final states. In fact, because this is true not just for free fields, all the crazy stuff that 
happens at intermediate times in an interacting theory must be time-ordered too. But the 
great thing is that we do not need to know which are the initial states and which are the 
final states anymore when we do the hard part of the computation. We just have to calculate 
time-ordered products, and the LSZ formula sorts out what is being scattered for us. 
6.1.2 LSZ for operators 
For perturbation theory in the Standard Model, which is mostly what we will study in this 
book, the LSZ formula in the above form is all that is needed. However, the LSZ formula 
is more powerful than it seems and applies even if we do not know what the particles are. 
If you go back through the derivation, you will see that we never needed an explicit form 
for the full field ¢( x) and its creation operators ab (t), which did not necessarily evolve like 
creation operators in the free theory. In fact, all we used was that the field ¢( x) creates free 
particle states at asymptotic times. So the LSZ reduction actually implies 
(P3'" Pn lSI P1P2) = [i J 
d4xl e - iP1Xl (01 + m2)] ... [i J 
d4XneiPnXn (On + m2)] 
x (DIT{Ol(xl)02(X2 )03(x3)'" On(xn)}ID) , 
(6.20) 
where the Oi(X) are any operators that can create one-particle states. By this we mean that 
(pIO(x)ID) = Zeipx 
(6.21) 
3 It should not be obvious at this point that there cannot be higher-order poles, such as ( 
1 
)2' coming out 
p2 _ rn2 
of time-ordered products. Such terms would signal the appearance of unphysical states known as ghosts, which 
violate unitarity. The fastest a correlation function can decay at large p2 in a unitary theory is as p-2, a result 
we will prove in Section 24.2. 

74 
The S-matrix and time-ordered products 
for some number Z. LSZ does not distinguish elementary particles, which we define to 
mean particles that have corresponding fields appearing in the Lagrangian, from any other 
type of particle. Anything that overlaps with one-particle states will produce an appropriate 
pole to be canceled by the 0 + m 2 factors giving a non-zero S-matrix element. Therefore, 
particles in the Hilbert space can be produced whether or not we have elementary fields for 
them. 
It is probably worth saying a little more about what these operators On(X) are. The 
operators can be defined as they would be in quantum mechanics, by their matrix elements 
in a basis of states 1/Jn of the theory Cnm = (1/Jn IOI1/Jm). Any such operator can be written 
as a sum over creation and annihilation operators: 
° = L J 
dql ... dqndPl··· dPmaL ... qL apm ... ap1 Cnm(ql, ... ,Pm). 
n ,m 
(6.22) 
It is not hard to prove that the Cnm are in one-to-one correspondence with the matrix 
elements of ° in nand m particle states (see Problem 6.3). One can turn the operator into 
a functional of fields, using Eq. (6.13) and its conjugate. The most important operators 
in relativistic quantum field theory are Lorentz-covariant composite operators constructed 
out of elementary fields, e.g. O(x) = ¢(x)8J-L¢(x)8J-L¢(x). However, some operators, such 
as the Hamiltonian, are not Lorentz invariant. Other operators, such as Wilson lines (see 
Section 25.2), are non-local. Also, non-Lorentz-invariant operators are essential for many 
condensed-matter applications. 
As an example of this generalized form of LSZ, suppose there were a bound state in our 
theory, such as positronium. We will derive the Lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics in 
Chapter 13. We will find, as you might imagine, that it is a functional of only the electron, 
positron and photon fields. Positronium is a composite state, composed of an electron, a 
positron and lots of photons binding them together. It has the same quantum numbers as the 
operator Op(x) = {Je(x)1/Je(x), where {J(x) and 1/J(x) are the fields for the positron and 
electron. Thus, Op(x) should have some non-zero overlap with positronium, and we can 
insert it into the time-ordered product to calculate the S-matrix for positronium scattering 
or production. This is an important conceptual fact: there do not have to be fundamental 
fields associated with every asymptotic state in the theory to calculate the S -matrix. 
Conversely, even if we do not know what the elementary particles actually are in the 
theory, we can introduce fields corresponding to them in the Lagrangian to calculate 
S-matrix elements in perturbation theory. For example, in studying the proton or other 
nucleons, we can treat them as elementary particles. As long as we are interested in ques-
tions that do not probe the substructure of the proton, such as non-relativistic scattering, 
nothing will go wrong. This is a general and very useful technique, known generally as 
effective field theory, which will play an impOltant role in this book. Thus, quantum field 
theory is very flexible: it works if you use fields that do not correspond to elementary par-
ticles (effective field theories) or if you scatter particles that do not have corresponding 
fields (such as bound states). It even can provide a predictive description of unstable com-
posite particles, such as the neutron, which neither have elementary fields nor are proper 
asymptotic states.

6.2 The Feynman propagator 
-------------------------------------~~---------------------- ---------
6.2 The Feynman propagator 
To recap, our immediate goal, as motived in Chapter 5, is to calculate cross sections, which 
are determined by S-matrix elements. We now have an expression, the LSZ reduction 
forJUula, for S-matrix elements in terms of time-ordered products of fields. Next, we need 
to figure out how to compute those time-ordered products. As an example, we will now 
calculate a time-ordered product in the free theory. In Chapter 7, we will derive a method 
for computing time-ordered products in interacting theories using pelturbation theory. 
We start with the free-field operator: 
(6.23) 
where ko = Wk = vi m 2 + k2 and ak and at are time independent (all time dependence is 
in the phase). Then, using 10) instead of In) to denote the vacuum in the free theory,

(01¢0(xd¢0(X2)10) = J 
(~:~3 2~k eik(X2- X,). 
(6.25) 
Now, we are interested in (OIT {¢(Xl)¢(X2)) 10). Recalling that time ordering puts the later 
field on the left, we get 
where T = tl - t2 . Taking k .-, -k in the first term leaves the volume integral J d3k 
invariant and gives

c -7 0 in the end. The location of the two poles in the complex plane is shown in Figure 6.1. 
Including an eiWT factor, as on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.28), we can integrate from 
-00 < W < 00 by closing the contour upwards when T > 0 and downwards when T < O. 
The first fraction in Eq. (6.29) then picks up the pole only if T < 0, giving 0 otherwise.

points to keep in mind: 
• ko i Vk2 + m 2 anymore. It is a separate integration variable. The propagating field 
can be off-shell! 
• The i comes from a contour integral. We will always get factors of i in 2-point functions 
of real fields. 
• The E is just a trick for representing the time ordering in a simple way. We will always 
take E ---+ 0 at the end, and often leave it implicit. You always need a +iE for time-
ordered products, but it is really just shorthand for a pole prescription in the contour 
integral, which is exactly equivalent to adding various 8(t) factors. 
• For E = 0 the Feynman propagator looks just like a classical Green's function for the 
Klein-Gordon equation (D+m 2)DF(x,y) = -io4 (x) with certain boundary con-
ditions. That is because it is. We are just computing classical propagation in a really 
complicated way. 
As we saw in Chapter 4 using old-fashioned perturbation theory, when using physical 
intermediate states there are contributions from advanced and retarded propagators, both 
of which are also Green's functions for the Klein-Gordon equation. The Lorentz-invariant 
Feynman propagator encodes both of these contributions, with its boundary condition rep-
resented by the iE in the denominator. The advanced and retarded propagators have more 
complicated integral representations, as you can explore in Problem 6.2.

Feynman rules 
In the previous chapter, we saw that scattering cross sections are naturally expressed in 
terms of time-ordered products of fields. The S-matrix has the form 
(7.1) 
where In) is the ground state/vacuum in the interacting theory. In this expression the fields 
¢( x) are not free but are the full interacting quantum fields. We also saw that in the free 
theory, the time-ordered product of two fields is given by the Feynman propagator:

where 10) is the ground state in the free theory. 
In this chapter, we will develop a method of calculating time-ordered products in pertur-
bation theory in terms of integrals over various Feynman propagators. There is a beautiful 
pictorial representation of the perturbation expansion using Feynman diagrams and an 
associated set of Feynman rules. There are position-space Feynman rules, for calculating 
time-ordered products, and also momentum-space Feynman rules, for calculating S-matrix 
elements. The momentum-space Feynman rules are by far the more important - they pro-
vide an extremely efficient way to set up calculations of physical results in quantum field 
theory. The momentum-space Feynman rules are the main result of Part I. 
We will first derive the Feynman rules using a Lagrangian formulation of time evolu-
tion and quantization. This is the quickest way to connect Feynman diagrams to classical 
field theory. We will then derive the Feynman rules again using time-dependent pertur-
bation theory, based on an expansion of the full interacting Hamiltonian around the free 
Hamiltonian. This calculation much more closely parallels the way we do perturbation the-
ory in quantum mechanics. While the Hamiltonian-based calculation is significantly more 
involved, it has the distinct advantage of connecting time evolution directly to a Hermitian 
Hamiltonian, so time evolution is guaranteed to be unitary. The Feynman rules resulting 
from both approaches agree, confirming that the approaches are equivalent (at least in the 
case of the theory of a real scalar field, which is all we have so seen so far). As we progress 
in our understanding of field theory and encounter particles of different spin and more com-
plicated interactions, unitarity and the requirement of a Hermitian Hamiltonian will playa 
more important role (see in particular Chapter 24). A third independent way to derive the 
Feynman rules is through the path integral (Chapter 14). 

7.1 Lagrangian derivation 
----
7.1 Lagrangian derivation 
In Section 2.3 we showed that free quantum fields satisfy 
[¢(x, t), ¢(x', t)] = 0, 
[¢(x, t), Ot¢(x', t)] = iM3(x - x') 
(7.3) 
(7.4) 
(we have temporarily reinstated n to clarify the cia ical limit). We also showed that free 
uantum fields satisfy the free scalar field Euler- Lagrange equalion (0 + m 2 )¢ = o. 
in an arbitrary interacting theory, we must generalLze lhese equation to specify how the 
dynamics is determined. In quantum mechanics, this is done with the Hamiltonian. So, 
one natural approach is to assume that iot¢(x) = [¢, H] for an interacting quantum field 
theory, which leads to the Hamiltonian derivation of the Feynman rules in Section 7.2. In 
this section we discuss the simpler Lagrangian approach based on the Schwinger-Dyson 
equations, which has the advantage of being manifestly Lorentz invariant from start to 
finish. 
In the Lagrangian approach, Hamilton's equations are replaced by the Euler-Lagrange 
equations. We therefore assume that our interacting fields satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions derived from a Lagrangian .c (the generalization of (0 + m 2 ) ¢ = 0), just like 
classical fields. We will also assume Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4) are still satisfied. This is a natural 
assumption, since at any given time the Hilbert space for the interacting theory is the same 
as that of a free theory. Equation (7.3) is a necessary condition for causality: at the same 
time but at different points in space, all operators, in particular fields, should be simultane-
ously observable and commute (otherwise there could be faster-than-light communication). 
This causality requirement will be discussed more in the context of the spin-statistics theo-
rem in Section 12.6. Equation (7.4) is the equivalent of the canonical commutation relation 
from quantum mechanics: [x, z3] = in. It indicates that a quantity and its time derivative 
are not simultaneously observable - the hallmark of the uncertainty principle. 
At this point we only know how to calculate (0 IT {¢(x)¢(x')}1 0) in the free theory. 
To calculate this commutator in an interacting theory, it is helpful to have the intermediate 
result 
where ID) is the vacuum in the interacting theory. The 04(X - x') on the right side of 
this equation is critically important. It signifies the difference between the classical and 
quantum theories in a way that will be clear shortly. 
To derive Eq. (7.5) we calculate 
Ot(DIT{¢(x)¢(x')}1 D) = od(DI¢(x)¢ (x')ID)8(t - t') + (DI¢(x')¢(x)ID)8(t' - t)] 
= (DIT {Ot¢(x)¢(x')}ID) + (DI¢(x)¢(x')ID)ot8(t - t') + (DI¢(x')¢(x)ID)ot8(t' - t) 
= (DIT {Ot¢(x)¢(x')}ID) + o(t - t')(DI[¢(x), ¢(x')]ID), (7.6) 
79 

80 
Feynman rules 
where we have used oxf}(x) = J(x) in the last line. The second term on the last line 
vanishes, since J(t - tl) forces t = tl and [if>(x), if>(xl)] = 0 at equal times. Taking a 
second time derivative then gives 
o;(DIT{if>(x)if>(y)}ID) = (DIT{o;if>(x)if>(x')}ID) + J(t - t')(DI[otif>(x), if>(x')]ID). 
(7.7) 
Here again J(t - tl) forces the time to be equal, in which case [Otif>(x) , if>(xl)] 
~ 
- iM3(x - Xl) as in Eq. (7.4). Thus, 
o;(DIT{if>(x)if>(y)}ID) = (DIT{o;if>(x)if>(x')}ID) - iM4(x - Xl) 
(7.8) 
and Eq. (7.5) follows. 
For example, in the free theory, (0 + m2 ) if>o(x) = O. Then Eq. (7.5) implies 
(Ox + m 2) DF(X, y) = - iM4(x - y), 
(7.9) 
which is easy to verify from Eq. (7.2). 
Introducing the notation (- .. ) = (DIT {- .. } ID) for time-ordered correlation functions 
in the interacting theory, Eq. (7.5) can be written as 
(0 + m2)(if>(x)if>(xl)) = ((0 + m2)if>(x)if>(xl)) - iM4(x - Xl). 
(7.10) 
It is not hard to see that similar equations hold for commutators involving more fields. 
We will get [Ot if> ( x), if> ( x j)] terms from the time derivatives acting on the time-ordering 
operator giving J-functions. The result is that 
Ox (if>(X)if>(X1) ... if>(xn)) = (Oxif>(x)if>(xd'" if>(xn)) 
- in L J4(x - Xj)(if>(xd'" if>(Xj-dif>(Xj+1)'" if>(xn)). 
(7.11) 
j 
You should check this generalization by calculating Ox (if>(X)if>(Xdif>(X2)) on your own. 
Now we use the fact that the quantum field satisfies the same equations of motion 
as the classical field, by assumption. In particular, if the Lagrangian has the form L = 
-~if>(0 + m2)if> + .cinM] then the (quantum) field satisfies (0 + m2)if> - L(nt[if>] = 0, 
where .crnM] = lq,Linr[¢], giving 
(Ox + m2) (if>xif>l ... if>n) = (L(nt [if>x] if>1 ... if>n) 
- in L J4(x - Xj) (if>1 ... if>j-1 if>j+1 ... if>n), 
(7.12) 
j 
where if>x =- if> ( x) and if>j =- if> (x j). These are known as the Schwinger-Dyson 
equations. 
The Schwinger-Dyson equations encode the difference between the classical and quan-
tum theories. Note that their derivation did not require any specification of the dynamics 
of the theory, only that the canonical commutation relations in Eq. (7.4) are satisfied.

7.1.1 Position-space Feynman rules 
-
The schwinger-Dyson equations specify a completely non-perturbative relationship 
aUlong correlation functions in the fully interacting theory. Some non-perturbative impli-
cations will be discussed in later chapters (in particular Sections 14.8 and 19.5). In this 
section, we will solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations in perturbation theory. 
For efficiency, we write 6xi = 04(x - Xi) and Dij = Dji = Dp(Xi' Xj). We will also 
set m = 0 for simplicity (the m i=- 0 case is a trivial generalization), and Ii = 1. With 
this notation, the Green's function equation for the Feynman propagator can be written 
concisely as 
(7.13) 
This relation can be used to rewrite correlation functions in a suggestive form. For example, 
the 2-point function can be written as 
(c/h¢2) = J 
d4x 6xl(¢x¢2) = i J 
d4x (OxDxd (¢x¢2) = i J 
d4xDx1 0 x(¢x¢2), 
(7.14) 
where we have integrated by parts in the last step. This is suggestive because Ox acting on 
a correlator can be simplified with the Schwinger-Dyson equations. 
Now first suppose we are in the free theory where Lint = O. Then the 2-point function 
can be evaluated using the Schwinger-Dyson equation, Ox (¢x¢y) = -i6xy , to give 
(7.15) 
as expected. For a 4-point function, the expansion is similar: 
(¢1¢2¢3¢4) = i J 
d4x DxIOx(¢x¢2¢3¢4) 
= J 
d4x Dxd6x2(¢3¢4) + 6x3(¢2¢4) + 6x4(¢2¢3)}. 
(7.16) 
Collapsing the 6-functions and using Eq. (7.15), this becomes

Feynman rules 
Each of these terms is drawn as a diagram. In the diagrams, the points Xl ... X4 corre-
spond to points where the correlation function is evaluated and the lines connecting these 
points correspond to propagators. 
Next, we will add interactions. Consider for example the 2-point function again with 
Lagrangian £ = -~¢D¢ + fJ¢3 (the 3! is a convention that will be justified shortly). Up 
to Eq. (7.14) things are the same as before. But now an application of the Schwinger-Dyson 
equations involves £(nt [¢] = %¢2, so we get 
(¢l ¢2) = i J 
d4x Dlx (~(¢;¢2) - iOX2 ) . 
(7.18) 
To simplify this, we introduce another integral, use 02y = iDyDy2 , and integrate by parts 
again to give 
(¢1¢2) = D12 -
~ J 
d4xd4yDxlDY2Dy(¢;¢y) 
= D12 - g: J 
d4xd4yDxlD2Y(¢;¢~) +ig J 
d4xDlxD2x(¢x). 
(7.19) 
If we are only interested in order g2, the (¢~ ¢~) term can then be simplified using the free 
field Schwinger-Dyson result, Eq. (7.17), 
(7.20) 
The (¢x) term in Eq. (7.19) can be expanded using the Schwinger-Dyson equations again: 
(¢x) = i J 
d4yDxyDy(¢y) = i~ J 
d4yDxy(¢~) = i~ J 
d4yDxyDyy + O(l). 
(7.21) 
Thus the final result is 
(¢1¢2) = D12 - g2 J 
d4Xd4Y(~D1XD;yDY2 + ~D1XDxxDyyDY2 
+~D1XD2XDxyDyy) . 
The three new terms correspond to the diagrams 
+ 
+ 
These diagrams now have new points, labeled X and y, which are integrated over. 
(7.22) 
(7.23) 
From these examples, and looking at the pictures, it is easy to infer the way the 
perturbative expansion will work for higher-order terms or more general interactions. 
1. Start with (external) points Xi for each position at which fields in the correlation 
function are evaluated. Draw a line from each point. 
2. A line can then either contract to an existing line, giving a Feynman propagator con-
necting the endpoints of the two lines, or it can split, due to an interaction. A split gives 
a new (internal) vertex proportional to the coefficient of £!nt[¢] times i and new lines 
corresponding to the fields in Lint [¢]. 

7.1 Lagrangian derivation

At a given order in the perturbative couplings, the result is the sum of all diagrams with 
3. all the lines contracted, integrated over the positions of internal vertices.

Thus, when the derivative is taken to turn the interaction into a vertex, Ihe prefactor 
becomes (n21)!' This (n - I)! is then canceled by Ih number or permutation of the lines 
coming out of the vertex, not including the line coming in, which we already fixed. In this 
way, the n! factors all cancel. The diagram is therefore associated with just the prefactor 
\ 9 K, etc. from the interaction. 
/\, , , 
In some cases, such as theories with real scalar fields, some of the permutations give the 
same amplitude. For example, if a line connects back to itself, then permuting the two legs 
gives the same integral. In this case, a factor of ~ in the normalization is not canceled, so 
we must divide by 2 to get the prefactor for a diagram. That is why the third diagram in 
Eq. (7.23) has a ~ and the second diagram has a ~. For the first diagram, the factor of ~ 
comes from exchanging the two lines connecting x and y. So there is one more rule: 
4. Drop all the n! factors in the coefficient of the interaction, but then divide by the 
geometrical symmetry factor for each diagram. 
Symmetries are ways that a graph can be deformed so that it looks the same with the 
external points, labeled Xi, held fixed. Thus, while there are symmetry factors for the 
graphs in Eq. (7.23), a graph such as 
(7.25) 
has no symmetry factor, since the graph cannot be brought back to itself without tangling 
up the external lines. The safest way to determine the symmetry factor is simply to write 
down all the diagrams using the Feynman rules and see which give the same integrals. In 
practice, diagrams almost never have geometric symmetry factors; occasionally in theories 
with scalars there are factors of 2. 
As mentioned in the introduction, an advantage of this approach is that it provides an 
intuitive way to connect and contrast the classical and quantum theories. In a classical 
theory, as noted above, the contact interactions are absent. It was these contact interactions 
that allowed us to contract two fields within a correlation function to produce a term in 
the expansion with fewer fields. For example, D(cPlcP2cP3cP4) = i012 (cP3cP4) + .... In the 
classical theory, all that can happen is that the fields will proliferate. Thus, we can have 
diagrams such as

(7.26) 
The first process may represent general relativistic corrections to Mercury's orbit (see 
Eq. (3.85)), which can be calculated entirely with classical field theory. The external points 
in this case are all given by external sources, such as Mercury or the Sun, which are 
illustrated with the blobs. The second process represents an electron in an external elec-
tromagnetic field (see Eq. (4.37)). This is a semi-classical process in which a single field 
is quantized (the electron) and does not get classical-source blobs on the end of its lines. 
But since quantum mechanics is first-quantized, particles cannot be created or destroyed 
and no closed loops can form. Thus, neither of these first two diagrams involve virtual 
pair creation. The third describes a process that can only be described with quantum field 
theory (or, with difficulty, with old-fashioned perturbation theory as in Eq. (4.44)). It is 
a Feynman diagram for the electron self-energy, which will be calculated properly using 
quantum field theory in Chapter 18. 
7.2 Hamiltonian derivation 
In this section, we reproduce the position-space Feynman rules using time-dependent 
perturbation theory. Instead of assuming that the quantum field satisfies the Euler-
Lagrange equations, we instead assume its dynamics is determined by a Hamiltonian H 
by the Heisenberg equations of motion iot¢(x) = [¢, H]. The formal solution of this 
equation is 
¢(x, t) = S(t, to)t¢(x)S(t, to), 
(7.27) 
where S(t, to) is the time-evolution operator (the S-matrix) that satisfies 
iotS(t, to) = H(t)S(t, to). 
(7.28) 
These are the dynamical equations in the Heisenberg picture where all the time depen-
dence is in operators. States including the vacuum state 1st) in the Heisenberg picture are, 
by definition, time independent. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the Hamiltonian can either be 
defined at any given time as a functional of the fields ¢ (x) and 'if (x) or equivalently as a 
functional of the creation and annihilation operators at and a
p . We will not need an explicit 
form of the Hamiltonian for this derivation so we just assume it is some time-dependent 
operator H ( t ) . 
The first step in time-dependent perturbation theory is to write the Hamiltonian as 
H(t) = Ho + V(t), 
(7.29) 
where the time evolution induced by Ho can be solved exactly and V is small in some 
sense. For example, Ho could be the free Hamiltonian, which is time independent, and V 
might be a ¢3 interaction: 

7.2 Hamiltonian derivation 
--------------------------------------------------------
(7.30) 
The operators ¢(x, t), H, Ho and V are all in the Heisenberg picture. 
Next, we need to change to the interaction picture. In the interaction picture the fields 
evolve only with Ho· The interaction picture fields are just what we had been calling (and 
will continue to call) the free fields: 
J.. (- t) = eiHo(t-to)J..(x)e-iHo(t-to) = J d

. 
To be precise, ¢(x) is the Schrodinger picture field, which does not change with time. The 
free fields are equal to the Schrodinger picture fields and also to the Heisenberg picture 
fields, by definition, at a single reference time, which we call to. 
by 
Using Eq. (7.27), we see that the Heisenberg picture fields are related to the free fields 
¢(x, t) = st(t, to) e-iHo(t-to)¢o(x, t) eiHo(t-to)S(t, to) 
= ut (t, to)¢o(x, t) U(t, to) . 
(7.32) 
The operator U(t,to) == eiHo(t-to)S(t,to) therefore relates the full Heisenberg picture 
fields to the free fields at the same time t. The evolution begins from the time to where the 
fields in the two pictures (and the Schrodinger picture) are equal. 
We can find a differential equation for U(t, to) using Eq. (7.28): 
iotU(t, to) = i (OteiHo(t-to)) S(t, to) + eiHo(t-to)iotS(t, to) 
= _eiHo(t-to) HoS(t, to) + eiHo(t-to) H(t)S(t, to) 
= eiHo(t-to) [-Ho + H(t)] e-iHo(t-to)eiHo(t-to)S(t, to) 
= VI(t)U(t, to), 
(7.33) 
where VI( t) == eiHo(t-to) V( t)e-iHo(t-to) is the original Heisenberg picture potential V( t) 
from Eq. (7.29), now expressed in the interaction picture. 
If everything commuted, the solution to Eq. (7.33) would be U(t, to) 
exp( -i It: VI(t')dt'). But VI(h) does not necessarily commute with VI(t 2 ), so this is 
not the right answer. It turns out that the right answer is very similar: 
U(t, to) = T { exp [-i 1: dt'VI(t')] } , 
(7.34) 
where T {} is the time-ordering operator, introduced in Chapter 6. This solution works 
because time ordering effectively makes everything inside commute: 
T{A .. ·B .. ·} = T{B .. ·A .. ·}. 
(7.35) 
Taking the derivative, you can see immediately that Eq. (7.34) satisfies Eq. (7.33). Since it 
has the right boundary conditions, namely U(t, t) = 1, this solution is unique. 
Time ordering of an exponential is defined in the obvious way through its expansion: 
U(t, to) = 1 - i it dt'VI(t') - ~ it dt'i

Feynman rules 
This is known as a Dyson series. Dyson defined the time-ordered product and this series 
in his classic paper [Dyson, 1949]. In that paper he showed the equivalence of old-
fashioned perturbation theory or, more exactly, the interaction picture method developed 
by Schwinger and Tomonaga based on time-dependent perturbation theory, and Feynman's 
method, involving space-time diagrams, which we are about to get to. 
7.2.1 Perturbative solution for the Dyson series 
We guessed and checked the solution to Eq. (7.33), which is often the easiest way to solve 
a differential equation. We can also solve it using perturbation theory. 
Removing the subscript on V for simplicity, the differential equation we want to solve is 
iotU(t, to) = V(t)U(t, to). 
Integrating this equation lets us write it in an equivalent form: 
U(t, to) = 1 - i rt dt'V(t')U(t', to), 
Jto 
where 1 is the appropriate integration constant so that U (to, to) = 1. 
(7.37) 
(7.38) 
Now we will solve the integral equation order-by-order in V. At zeroth order in V, 
U(t, to) = 1. 
(7.39) 
To first order in V we find 
U(t, to) = 1 - i (dt'V(t') + .... 
Jto 
(7.40) 
To second order,

U(t, to) = 1 - i 10 dt'V(t') 1 - i 10 dtIV(t") + ...

(7.41) 
The second integral has to < til < t' < t, which is the same as to < til < t and 
til < t' < t. So it can also be written as 
(dt' (' dtIV(t')V(t") = rt dtlli

where we have relabeled til f--+ t' and swapped the order of the integrals to get the third

(dt' (' dtIV(t')V(t") = ~ (dt' [ (' dtIV(t')V(t") + it dtIlV(tll)V(t')]

Continuing this way, we find, restoring the subscript on V, that 
U(t, to) = T {exp[ -i 1~ dt'Vr(t')]}. 
7.2.2 U relations 
It is convenient to abbreviate U with 
U21 == U(t2' td = T { exp [ -i 1:
2 
dt'Vr(t')] } . 
Remember that in field theory we always have later times on the left. It follows that 
U21U12 = 1, 
Ui/ = Udl = U12 
Multiplying this by U12 on the right, we find 
(7.44) 
(7.45) 
(7.46) 
(7.47) 
(7.48) 
(7.49) 
(7.50) 
which is the same identity with 2 ~ 1. Multiplying Eq. (7.49) by U23 on the left gives the 
same identity with 3 ~ 1. Therefore, this identity holds for any time ordering. 
Finally, our defining relation, Eq. (7.32), 
¢(x, t) = ut (t, to)¢o(x, t)U(t, to) 
(7.51) 
lets us write 
(7.52) 
7.2.3 Vacuum matrix elements 
In deriving LSZ we used that the vacuum state In) was annihilated by the operators ap(t) 
in the interacting theory at a time t = -00. To relate this to a state for which we know how 
the free-field creation and annihilation operators act, we need to evolve it to the reference 
time to where the free and interacting pictures are taken equal. This is straightforward: 
states evolve (in the Schrodinger picture) with S(t, to), and thus S(t, to) In) is annihilated 
by ap (to) at t = -00. Equivalently (in the Heisenberg picture) the operator ap (t) 
S(t, to)t ap(to) S(t, to) annihilates In) at t = -00. 
87 

88 
Feynman rules 
In the free theory, there is a state 10), which is annihilated by the ap . Since the ap 
evolve with a simple phase rotation, the same state 10) is annihilated by the (free the-
ory) ap at any time. More precisely, even if we do not assume 10) has zero energy, then 
ap(to) eiHo(t- to) 10) = ° at t = - 00. Since at the time to the free and interacting 
theory creation and annihilation operators are equal, the ap in both theories annihilate 
eiHoCt-to) 10) and S(t, to) ID). Thus, the two states must be proportional. Therefore 
ID) = Ni lim st (t, to) eiHoCt-to) 10) = NiUo- oo 10) 
(7.53) 
t-+ -
CX) 
for some number Ni. Similarly, (DI = Nj(OIUooo for some number N j . 
Now let us see what happens when we rewrite correlation functions in the interaction 
picture. We are interested in time-ordered products (DIT {¢(Xl) ... ¢(xn)} ID). Since aU 
the ¢(Xi) are within a time-ordered product, we can write them in any order we want. So 
let us put them in time order, or equivalently we assume tl > ... > tn without loss of 
generality. Then, 
(DIT{¢(xd ··· ¢(xn)) ID) = (DI¢(xt}··· ¢(xn)ID) 
= NiNj (01 UooOUOl¢o (Xl)UlOUOZ¢o (xz) Uzo '" UOn¢O(xn)UnoUo-ooIO) 
= NiNj (OIUool ¢o(xdUlz¢o (X2)U23 ... UCn- l)n¢O(xn)Un-ooIO) . 
(7.54) 
Now, since the ti are in time order and the Uij are themselves time-ordered products 
involving times between ti and tj, everything in this expression is in time order. Thus 
(D IT{ ¢(xd··· ¢(xn)} ID) 
= NiNj(0IT{UOO1¢O(Xl)U12¢O(X2)U23'" ¢O(xn)Un-oo} IO) 
= NiNj(OIT{¢o(xd··· ¢o(xn)Uoo,-oo}IO). 
(7.55) 
The normalization should set so that (DID) = 1, just as (010) = 1 in the free theory. This 
implies NiNj = (OIUoo_oo IO)- l and therefore 
Substituting in Eq. (7.46) we then get 
(OIT { ¢o(xd· .. ¢O(xn) exp[- i Jexooo dtV1(t)]} 10) 
(DIT{¢(xl)'" ¢(xn)}ID) = 
. 
(OIT {exp[-i Jexooo dtV1(t)]} 10) 
(7.57) 
7.2.4 Interaction potential 
The only thing left to understand is what V1(t) is. We have defined the time to as when the 
interacting fields are the same as the free fields. For example, a cubic interaction would be 

7.2 Hamiltonian derivation 
89 
---------------------------------------------------------- -----
all that the time dependence of the free fields is determined by the free Hamiltonian, 
ReC 
¢o(x, t) = eiHo(t-to)¢o(x)e-iHo(t-to), 
(7.59) 
and therefore 
VI = eiHo(t-to) [J d3X~¢O(x)3] e-iHo(t-to) = J 
d3x~¢O(x, t)3 . 
(7.60) 
So the interaction picture potential is expressed in terms of the free fields at all times. 
Now we will make our final transition away from non-Lorentz-invariant Hamiltonians to 
Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians, leaving old-fashioned perturbation theory for good. Recall 
that the potential is related to the Lagrangian by VI = - J d3x £int[¢O], where Lint is the 
interacting part of the Lagrangian density. Then, 
uoo,-oo=eXP[-i[: dtVI(t)] =exp[i[: d
4X£inMol]. 
(7.61) 
The J.':'oo dt combines with the J d3x to give a Lorentz-invariant integral. 
In summary, matrix elements of interacting fields in the interacting vacuum are given by 
(nl),( ) ... ),( 
)In) = (OIUool¢O(Xl)U12¢O(X2)U23 '" ¢O(xn)Un,-ooIO) 
(7.62) 
H

<p Xn 
(OIUoo,-ooIO) 
, 
where In) is the ground state in the interacting theory and 
(7.63) 
with £inMl = £[¢l - £o[¢], where £o[¢l is the free Lagrangian. The free Lagrangian is 
defined as whatever goes into the free-field evolution, usually taken to be just kinetic terms. 
For the special case of time-ordered products, such as what we need for S-matrix 
elements, this simplifies to 
which is a remarkably simple and manifestly Lorentz-invariant result. 
7.2.5 Time-ordered products and contractions 
We will now see that the expansion of Eq. (7.64) produces the same position-space Feyn-
man rules as those coming from the Lagrangian approach described in Section 7.1. To see 
that, let us take as an example our favorite ¢3 theory with interaction Lagrangian 
(7.65) 
and consider (DIT{ ¢(Xd¢(X2)}ln).

A similar expansion would result from any time-ordered product of interacting fields. Thus, 
we now only need to evaluate correlation functions of products of free fields. 
To do so, is it helpful to write ¢o(x) = ¢+ (x) + ¢_ (x), where

with ¢+ containing only creation operators and ¢_ only annihilation operators. Then prod-
ucts of ¢o fields at different points become sums of products of ¢+ and ¢_ fields at 
different points. For example, 
(01 T{ ¢O(Xl)¢O(X2)¢O(X)3¢O(y)3} 10) 
= (01 T{ [¢+(xd+¢-(Xl)] [¢+(X2)+¢-(X2)] [¢+(x) + ¢_(x)]3[¢+(y)+¢_(y)]3} 10) 
= (01 T{ ¢+(Xd¢+(X2)¢+(x)3¢+(y)3} 10) 
+ 2(01 T{ ¢+(X2)¢+(Xl)¢+(x)3¢+(y?¢_(y)} 10) + ... . 
(7.68) 
The last line indicates that the result is the sum of a set of products of ¢+ and ¢_ operators 
evaluated at different points. In each element of this sum, a ¢+ would create a particle that, 
to give a non-zero result, must then be annihilated by some ¢_ operator. The matrix ele-
ment can only be non-zero if every particle that is created is destroyed, so every term must 
have four ¢+ operators and four ¢_ operators. Each pairing of ¢+ with ¢_ to get a Feyn-
man propagator is called a contraction (not to be confused with a Lorentz contraction). 
The result is then the sum of all possible contractions. 
Each contraction represents the creation and then annihilation of a particle, with the 
creation happening earlier than the annihilation. Each contraction gives a factor of the 
Feynman propagator: 
(7.69) 
A time-ordered correlation function of free fields is given by a sum over all possible ways 
in which all of the fields in the product can be contracted with each other. This is a result 
known as Wick's theorem. Wick's theorem is given in Box 7.3 and proven in the appendix

To see how Wick's theorem works, let us return to our example and use the nota-
tion Dij == DF(Xi,Xj). The first term in the expansion of (QIT{¢(xl)¢(x2)}IQ) is 
(OIT{ ¢o(xd¢o(x2)}10), from Eq. (7.66). There is only one contraction here, which gives 
the propagator DF(Xl, X2) = D12 . The second term in Eq. (7.66) has an odd number of

Ids, and therefore cannot be completely contracted and must vanish. The third term in 
~:~7 .66) involves six fields, and there are mUltiple possible contractions: 
(OIT{ ¢rjXl )¢rjX2)¢rjX )¢rjx )¢rjx )¢o(y )¢rjy )¢o(y)} 10) 
== 9D12DxxDxyDyy + 6D1 2D~y 
+ 18DlxD2xDxyDyy + 9Dlx D2yDxxDyy + 18DI x D2yD~y 
+ 18DlyD2yDxyDxx + 9Dly D2xDxxDyy + 18D lyD2x D~y . 
(7.70) 
As in Eq. (7.66), we have to integrate over x and y. Thus, many of these terms (those on 
the last line) give the same contributions as other terms. We find, to order g2, 
(7.71) 
The position-space Feynman rules that connect this expansion to diagrams are the same 
as those coming from the Lagrangian approach in Section 7.1. Comparing to Eq. (7.22) 
we see that the sum of terms is exactly the same, including combinatoric factors, with two 
exceptions: the (0 IT { eiJ L,lot} 10) factor and the first two terms on the second line. The two 
new terms correspond to diagrams 
and 
These two differences precisely cancel. 
Xl • 
X2 • 
(7.72) 
To see the cancellation, note that the extra diagrams both include bubbles. That is, 
they have connected subgraphs not involving any external point. The bubbles are exactly 
what are in (01 T {eiJ L,lot} 10). To see this, note that Wick's theorem also applies to the 
denominator ofEq. (7.64). Up to order g2, Wick's theorem implies 
(01 T { eiJd4XL,;ot[¢o]} 10) = (010) + (~ y 
~ jd4x jd4Y (01 T { ¢o (x)3 ¢O(y) 3} 10) + .... 
(7.73) 
We have dropped the O(g) term since it involves an odd number of fields and therefore 
vanishes by Wick's theorem. Pelforming a similar expansion as above, we find 
(01 T{ eiJ d
4
XL,;oMo]} 10) = 1 + (~ y 
~ jd4x jd4y [9DxxDxyDyy + 6D~y] + O(l).

Feynman rules 
These diagrams are the bubbles QJ) and e. Expanding Eq. (7.71) including terms up 
to 0 (g2) in the numerator and denominator, we find 
(01 T{ ¢rAXl)¢O(x2)eiJ 'cint} 10) 
(01 T{ eiJ 'cmt} 10) 
D12 - g2 J [ ~ D1 2 Dxx DxyDYY+f2D12D~y + ... J 
1 - g2 J [iDxxDxyDyy + II2 D~yJ 
(7.75) 
Since H~2x = 1 - g2x + 0(g4), we can invert the denominator in perturbation theory to 
see that the bubbles exactly cancel. 
More generally, the bubbles will always cancel. Since the integrals in the expansion 
of the numerator corresponding to the bubbles never involve any external point, they just 
factor out. The sum over all graphs, in the numerator, is then the sum over all graphs with 
no bubbles multiplying the sum over the bubbles. In pictures, 
=( 
+ --D-- + ~ 
+ ~ 
+ ... 
+ --D--
+ ... )X(l + ~

(7.76) 
The sum over bubbles is exactly (01 T { eiJ 'cint} 10). So, 
(7.77) 
where "no bubbles" means that every connected subgraph involves an external point. 
7.2.6 Position-space Feynman rules 
We have shown that the same sets of diagrams appear in the Hamiltonian and the 
Lagrangian approaches: each point Xi in the original n-point function (DIT{¢(x l)' " 
¢(Xn)} In) gets an external point and each interaction gives a new vertex whose position 
is integrated over and whose coefficient is given by the coefficient in the Lagrangian. 
As long as the vertices are normalized with appropriate permutation factors, as in 
Eq. (7.24), the combinatoric factors will work out the same, as we saw in the example. 
In the Lagrangian approach, we saw that the coefficient of the diagram will be given by the 
coefficient ofthe interaction multiplied by the geometrical symmetry factor of the diagram. 
To see that this is also true for the Hamiltonian, we have to count the various combinatoric 
factors: 
• There is a factor of ~ from the expansion of exp( i'cint) = L: ~ (i'cjnt)m. If we expand 
m. 
m . 
to order m there will be m identical vertices in the same diagram. We can also swap 
these vertices around, leaving the diagram looking the same. If we only include the 
diagram once in our final sum, the m! from permuting the diagrams will cancel the ~ 
m. 
from the exponential. Neither of these factors were present in the Lagrangian approach, 

7.3 Momentum-space Feynman rules 
--------------------------------~----------------------
since internal vertices came out of the splitting of lines associated with external vertices, 
which was unambiguous, and there was no exponential to begin with. 
If interactions are normalized as in Eq. (7.24), then there will be a ~ for each interaction 
• 
J. 
with j identical particles. This factor is canceled by the j! ways of permuting the j 
identical lines corning out of the same internal vertex. In the Lagrangian approach, one 
of the lines was already chosen so the factor was (j - 1)!, with the missing j coming 
from using £(nt[¢] instead of £int[¢]. 
The result is the same Feynman rules as were derived in the Lagrangian approach. In both 
cases, symmetry factors must be added if there is some geometric symmetry (there rarely 
is in theories with complex fields, such as QED). In neither case do any of the diagrams 
include bubbles (subdiagrams that do not connect with any external vertex). 
7.3 Momentum-space Feynman rules 
The position-space Feynman rules derived in either of the previous two sections give a 
recipe for computing time-ordered products in perturbation theory. Now we will see how 
those time-ordered products simplify when all the phase-space integrals over the prop-
agators are performed to turn them into S-matrix elements. This will produce the 
momentum-space Feynman rules. 
Consider the diagram 
7i.= 
•• X_l __ 
X .. O .. _Y __ X_2 .... 
(7.78) 
To evaluate this diagram, first write every propagator in momentum space (taking m = 0 
for simplicity):

(211")4 p2 + ic: 
(7.79) 
Then there will be four d4p integrals from the four propagators and all the positions will 
appear only in exponentials. So,

(7.80) 
Now we can do the x and y integrals, which produce J4( -Pl +P3 +P4) and J4(p2 -P3 -P4) 
respectively, corresponding to momentum being conserved at the vertices labeled x and y 
in the Feynman diagram. If we integrate over P3 using the first J-function then we can 
replace P3 = Pl - P4 and the second J-function becomes J4(Pl - P2). Then we have, 
relabeling P4 = k,

Next, we use the LSZ formula to convert this to a contribution to the 8-matrix: 
U181i) = [-i J 
d4xle-iPiXl (P;)] [-i J 
d4x2eipjx2 (PJ)] (niT {¢(Xd¢(X2)) In) , 
(7.82) 
where pr and pj are the initial state and final state momenta. So the contribution of this 
diagram gives 
(7.83) 
Now we note that the Xl integral gives (27r)454(pl - Pi) and the X2 integral gives a 
(27r)4 54(p2 - Pi)' So we can now do the Pl and P2 integrals, giving

4 
(1812) = -2 
(27r)4 (Pi _ k)2 + iE k2 + iE (27r) 5 (pi - Pi) + .... 
(7.84) 
Note how the two propagator factors in the beginning get canceled. This always happens 
for external legs - remember the point of LSZ was to force the external lines to be on-shell 
one-particle states. By the way, this integral is infinite; Part III of this book is devoted to 
making sense out of these infinities. 
Finally, the 54 (pi - Pi) term in the answer forces overall momentum conservation, and 
will always be present in any calculation. But we will always factor it out, as we did when 
we related differential scattering amplitudes to 8-matrix elements. Recalling that 
(7.85) 
we have 
(7.86) 
We can summarize this procedure with the momentum-space Feynman rules. These 
Feynman rules, given in Box 7.1, tell us how to directly calculate iM from pictures. With 
these rules, you can forget about practically anything else we have covered so far. 
A couple of notes about the rules. The combinatoric factor for the diagram, as con-
tributing to the momentum-space Feynman rules, is given only by the geometric symmetry 
factor of the diagram. Identical particles are already taken care of in Wick's theorem; mov-
ing around the ap's and at's has the algebra of identical particles in them. The only time 
identical particles need extra consideration is when we cannot distinguish the particles we 
are scattering. This only happens for final states, since we distinguish our initial states by 
the setup of the experiment. Thus, when n of the same particles are produced, we have to 
divide the cross section by n!. 

7.3 Momentum-space Feynman rules 
-------------------------------~---------------------
• Internal lines (those not connected to external pOints) get propagators 
• 
p2=-m2+i E: • 
• Vertices come from interactions in the Lagrangian. They get factors of the 
coupling constant times i. 
• Lines connected to external points do not get propagators (their propaga-
tors are canceled by terms from the LSZ reduction formula). 
• Momentum is conserved at each vertex. 
• Integrate over undetermined 4-momenta. 
• Sum over all possible diagrams. 
7.3.1 Signs of momenta 
There is unfortunately no standard convention about how to choose the direction in which 
the momenta are going. For external momenta it makes sense to assign them their physical 
values, which should have positive energy. Then momentum conservation becomes 
(7.87) 
which appears in o-functions as 04(L:Pi - L:Pf). 
For internal lines, we integrate over the momenta, so it does not matter if we use kl" or 
-kl"' Still, it is important to keep track of which way the momentum is going so that all 
the o-functions at the vertices are also L:(Pin - Pout). We draw arrows next to the lines to 
indicate the flow of momentum: 
(7.88) 
We also sometimes draw arrows superimposed on lines, as 
.. 
. These arrows point 
in the direction of momentum for particles and opposite to the direction of momentum 
for antiparticles. We will discuss these particle-flow arrows more when we introduce 
antiparticles in Chapter 9. 
You should be warned that sometimes Feynman diagrams are drawn with time going 
upwards, particularly in describing hadronic collisions. 
7.3.2 Disconnected graphs 
A lot of the contractions will result in diagrams where some subset of the external vertices 
connect to each other without interacting with the other subsets. What do we do with graphs 
Where subsets are independently connected, such as the contribution to the 8-point function 
shown on the left in Figure 7.1 ? Diagrams like this have physical effects. For example, at

Disconnected diagram 
Connected diagram 
•• 
,. Disconnected graphs like the one on the lett have important physical effects. However, they 
have a different singularity structure and therefore zero interference with connected 
graphs, like the one on the right. 
a muon collider, there would be a contribution to the S-matrix from situations where the 
muons just decay independently, somewhat close to the interaction region, which look like 
the left graph, in addition to the contribution where the muons scatter off each other, which 
might look like the right graph in Figure 7.1. 
Clearly, both processes need to be incorporated for an accurate description of the col-
lision. However, the disconnected decay process can be computed from the S-matrix for 
1 --+ 3 scattering (as in either half of the left diagram). The probability for the 2 --+ 6 pro-
cess from the disconnected diagram is then just the product of the two 1 --+ 3 probabilities. 
More generally, the S-matrix (with bubbles removed) factorizes into a product of sums of 
connected diagrams, just as the bubbles factorized out of the full S-matrix (see Eq. (7.76)). 
The only possible complication is if there could be interference between the discon-
nected diagrams and the connected ones. However, this cannot happen: there is zero 
interference. To see why, recall that the definition of the matrix element that these 
time-ordered calculations produce has only a single o-function: 
(7.89) 
Disconnected matrix elements will have extra o-functions Mdisconnected = 04 (~subsetP) ( ... ) . 
Connected matrix elements are just integrals over propagators, as given by the Feynman 
rules. Such integrals can only have poles or possibly branch cuts, but are analytic functions 
of the external momenta away from these. They can never produce singularities as strong 
as o-functions. (The same decoherence is also relevant for meta-stable particles produced 
in collisions, where it leads to the narrow-width approximation, to be discussed in Sec-
tion 24.1.4.) Therefore, the disconnected amplitudes are always infinitely larger than the 
connected ones, and the intereference vanishes. You can check this in Problem 7.2. 
More profoundly, the fact that there can never be more than a single o-function coming 
out of connected amplitudes is related to a general principle called cluster decomposition, 
which is sometimes considered an axiom of quantum field theory [Weinberg, 1995]. The 
cluster decomposition principle says that experiments well-separated in space cannot influ-
ence each other. More precisely, as positions in one subset become well-separated from 
positions in the other subsets, the connected S-matrix should vanish. If there were an extra 
o-function, one could asymptotically separate some of the points in such a way that the

Technicalities of cluster decomposition aside, the practical result of this section is that 
the only thing we ever need to compute for scattering processes is 
(7.90) 
where "connected" means every external vertex connects to every other external vertex 
through the graph somehow. Everything else is factored out or normalized away. Bubbles 
come up occasionally in discussions of vacuum energy; disconnected diagrams are never 
important. 
7.4 Examples 
The Feynman rules will all make a lot more sense after we do some examples. Let us start

Let the incoming momenta be pi and p~ and the outgoing momenta be p~ and p~ .

We have dropped the is, which is fine as long as s, t and u are not equal to m 2 . (For that 
to happen, the intermediate scalar would have to go on-shell in one of the diagrams, which 
is a degenerate situation, usually contributing only to ] in the S-matrix. The is's will be 
necessary for loops, but in tree-level diagrams you can pretty much ignore them.) 
7.4.1 Mandelstam variables 
The variables s, t and u are called Mandelstam variables. They are a great shorthand, 
used almost exclusively in 2 ----7 2 scattering and in 1 ----7 3 decays, although there are 
generalizations for more momenta. For 2 ----7 2 scattering, with initial momenta PI and P2 
and final momenta P3 and P4, they are defined by 
These satisfy 
S == (PI + P2)2 = (P3 + P4)2, 
t == (PI - P3)2 = (P2 - P4)2, 
U == (PI - P4)2 = (P2 - P3)2. 
where mj are the invariant masses of the particles. 
(7.97) 
(7.98) 
(7.99) 
(7.100) 
As we saw in the previous example, s, t and u correspond to particular diagrams 
where momentum in the propagator has invariant P~ = s, t or u. This correspondence 
is summarized in Box 7.2. The s-channel is an annihilation process. In the s-channel, the

Iher frame, for e 'ample the frame of the lab in which we are ding the expcrim nt. We 
will use s, t and u a lot. 
7.4.2 Derivative couplings 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose we have an interaction with derivatives in it, such as 
(7.101) 
where three different scalar fields are included for clarity. In momentum space, these 0!1-'s 
give factors of momenta. But now remember that

¢(x) =

. 
(7.102) 
So, if the particle is being created (emerging from a vertex) it gets a factor of ip!1-' and if 
it is being destroyed (entering a vertex) it gets a factor of -ipw So, we get a minus for 
incoming momentum and a plus for outgoing momentum. In this case, it is quite important 
to keep track of whether momentum is flowing into or out of the vertex. 
For example, take the diagram 
(7.103) 
Label the initial momenta pi and p~ and the final momenta pi and p',f. The exchanged 
momentum is k!1- = pi + p~ = pi + p',f. Then this diagram gives 
'M = (,.\)2 (_. !1-)( 'k!1-)~(' /1/)(_ 'kl/) = _ ,.\2 [P2 . PI + (p2)2l(P~ 'p~ + (p~)2l

. 
(7.104) 
As a cross check, we should get the same answer if we use a different Lagrangian related 
to the one we used by integration by parts: 
(7.105) 
Now our one diagram becomes four diagrams, from the two types of vertices on the two 
sides, all of which look like Eq. (7.103). It is easiest to add up the contributions to the 
vertices before multiplying, which gives 
M = (i.\)2 [( -ip~)( -ipi) + (-iP2)2] :2 [(ip~)(iPi) + (iP;)2] 
= _ i.\2 (P2 . PI + (p2)2l(P~ . p~ + (p~)2l , 
(PI + P2)2 
(7.106) 
Which is exactly what we had above. So, integrating by parts does not affect the matrix 
elements, as expected. Thus the Feynman rules passed our cross check. 
99 

100 
Feynman rules 
To see more generally that integrating by parts does not affect matrix elements, it is 
enough to show that total derivatives do not contribute to matrix elements. Suppose we 
have a term 
(7.107) 
where there are any number of fields in this term. This would give a contribution from the 
derivative acting on each field, with a factor of that field's momenta. So if the vertex would 
have given V without the derivative, adding the derivative makes it 
( L P~ - L pt)v. 
(7.108) 
incoming 
outgoing 
Since the sum of incoming momenta is equal to the sum of outgoing momenta, because 
momentum is conserved at each vertex, we conclude that total derivatives do not contribute 
to matrix elements 
To be precise, total derivatives do not contribute to matrix elements in perturbation 
theory. The term 
(7.109) 
is a total derivative. If we add a term e clwa(3 Fp,vFa(3 to the Lagrangian, indeed noth-
ing happens in perturbation theory. It turns out that there are effects of this term that 
will never show up in Feynman diagrams, but are perfectly real. They have physical con-
sequences. For example, if this term appeared in the Lagrangian with anything but an 
exponentially small coefficient, it would lead to an observable electric dipole moment for 
the neutron. That no such moment has been seen is known as the strong CF problem (see 
Section 29.5.3). A closely related effect from such a total derivative is the mass of the r/ 
meson, which is larger than it could possibly be without total-derivative terms (see Sec-
tion 30.5.2). In both cases the physical effect comes from the strong interactions which are 
non-perturbative. 
7.A Normal ordering and Wick's theorem 
In this appendix we prove that the vacuum matrix element of a time-ordered product of free 
fields is given by the sum of all possible full contractions, a result known as Wick's theo-
rem. This theorem is necessary for the derivation of the Feynman rules in the Hamiltonian 
approach. 
7.A.1 Normal ordering 
To prove Wick's theorem, we will manipulate expressions with creation and annihilation 
operators into the form of a c-number expression plus terms that vanish when acting on the 
vacuum. This is always possible since we can commute the annihilation operators past the 
creation operators until they are all on the right, at which point they give zero when acting 
on the vacuum. 

7.A Normal ordering and Wick's theorem 
----------------------------------------------------------
For example, we can write 
(7.A.IlO) 
Then, since the terms with annihilation operators on the right vanish, as do the terms with 
creation operators on the left, we get 
(7.A.l11) 
We call terms with all annihilation operators on the right normal ordered. 
Normal ordered: all the at operators are on the left of all the a
p operators. 
We represent normal ordering with colons. So, 
(7.A.112) 
When you normal order something, you just pick up the operators and move them. Just 
manhandle them over, without any commuting, just as you manhandled the operators 
within a time-ordered product. Thus the o(p - k) from Eq. (7.A.110) does not appear 
in Eq. (7.A.112). 
The point of normal ordering is that vacuum matrix elements of normal-ordered products 
of fields vanish: 
(7.A.113) 
The only normal-ordered expressions that do not vanish in the vacuum are c-number 
functions. Such a function f satisfies 
(01 :f: 10) = f. 
(7.A.114) 
The nice thing about normal ordering is that we can use it to specify operator relations. For 
example, 
T {¢o(x)¢o(y)} = :¢o(x)¢o(y) + DF(x, y):. 
(7.A.llS) 
This is obviously true in vacuum matrix elements, since DF(X, y) = (OIT {¢o(x)¢o(Y)} 10) 
and vacuum matrix elements of normal-ordered products vanish. But it is also true at the 
level of the operators, as we show below. The point is that by normal ordering expressions 
we can read off immediately what will happen when we take vacuum matrix elements, but 
no information is thrown out. 
7.A.2 Wick's theorem 
Wick's theorem relates time-ordered products of fields to normal-ordered products of fields 
and contractions. It is given in Box 7.3. A contraction means taking two fields ¢O(Xi) and 
101 

102 
Feynman rules 
Wick's theorem 
all possible 
contractions 
¢O(Xj) from anywhere in the series and replacing them with a factor of DF(Xi,Xj) for 
each pair of fields. "All possible contractions" includes one contraction, two contractions, 
etc., involving any of the fields. But each field can only be contracted once. Since normal-
ordered products vanish unless all the fields are contracted, this implies· that the time-
ordered product is the sum of all the full contractions, which is what we will actually use 
to generate Feynman rules. 
Wick's theorem is easiest to prove first by breaking the field up into creation and 
annihilation parts, ¢o(x) = ¢+(x) + ¢_(x), where 
(7.A.l16) 
Since [ak' at] = (27f)\)3(p - k), commutators of these operators are just functions. In 
fact, the Feynman propagator can be written as 
DF(Xl, X2) = (OIT{¢o(xd ¢o(x2)}1 0) 
= [¢-(Xl), ¢+(X2)] e(tl - t2) + [¢-(X2) , ¢+(Xl)] e(t2 - tl)' (7.A.117) 
This particular combination represents a contraction. 
Let us verify Wick's theorem for two fields. For tl > t2 
T{¢o(xd¢o(X2)} = ¢+(Xl) ¢+(X2)+¢+(Xl) ¢-(x2)+¢-(xd ¢+(X2)+¢-(Xl) ¢-(X2) . 
(7.A. 11 8) 
All terms in this expression are normal ordered except for ¢_ (xd ¢+(X2). So, 
(7.A.1l9) 
For t2 > tl, the expression is the same with Xl ~ X2. Thus, 
(7.A.120) 
exactly as Wick's theorem requires. 
The full proof is straightforward to do by mathematical induction. We have shown that 
it works for two fields. Assume it holds for n - 1 fields. Without loss of generality, let tl 
be the latest time for all n fields. Then,

Since ¢+ (Xl) is on the left and contains at operators, we can just move it into the normal-

The result of Wick's theorem is that time-ordered products are given by a bunch of

vacuum matrix elements, all that remains for vacuum matrix elements of time-ordered 
products are the Feynman propagators.

QUANTUM 
ELECTRODYNAMICS 


Up until now, we have dealt with general features of quantum field theories. For example, 
we have seen how to calculate scattering amplitudes starting from a general Lagrangian. 
Now we will begin to 'explore what the Lagrangian of the real world could possibly be. In 
Part IV we will discuss what it actually is, or at least what is known about it so far. 
A good way to start understanding the consistency requirements of the physical uni-
verse is with a discussion of spin. There is a deep connection between spin and Lorentz 
invariance that is obscure in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. For example, well before 
quantum field theory, it was known from atomic spectroscopy that the electron had two 
spin states. It was also known that light had two polarizations. The polarizations of light 
are easy to understand at the classical level since light is a field, but how can an individual 
photon be polarized? For the electron, we can at least think of it as a spinning top, so there 
is a classical analogy, but photons are massless and structureless, so what exactly is spin-
ning? The answers to these questions follow from an understanding of Lorentz invariance 
and the requirements of a consistent quantum field theory. 
Our discussion of spin and the Lorentz group is divided into a discussion of integer 
spin particles (tensor representations) in this chapter and half-integer spin particles (spinor 
representations) in Chapter 10. 
8.1 Unitary representations of the Poincare group 
Our universe has a number of apparent symmetries that we would like our quantum field 
theory to respect. One symmetry is that no place in space-time seems any different from any 
other place. Thus, our theory should be translation invariant: if we take all our fields 'ljJ (x) 
and replace them by 'ljJ(x + a) for any constant 4-vector aV , the observables should look 
the same. Another symmetry is Lorentz invariance: physics should look the same whether 
we point our measurement apparatus to the left or to the right, or put it on a train. The 
group of translations and Lorentz transformations is called the Poincare group, IS0(1,3) 
(the isometry group of Minkowski space). 
Our universe also has a bunch of different types of particles in it. Particles have mass and 
spin and all kinds of other quantum numbers. They also have momentum and the value of 
spin projected on some axis. If we rotate or boost to change frame, only the momenta and 
the spin projection change, as determined by the Poincare group, but the other quantum 
109 

110 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
numbers do not. So a particle can be defined as a set of states that mix only among 
themselves under Poincare transformations. 
Generically, we can write that our states transform as 
(8.1) 
under a Poincare transformation P. A set of objects 'I/J that mix under a transformation 
group is called a representation of the group. For example, scalar fields 4>( x) at all points 
x form a representation of translations, since 4>( x) ---- 4>( x + a). Quite generally, in a given 
representation there should be a basis for the states I'I/J), call it {I'l/Ji)}, where i is a discrete 
or continuous index, so that 
(8.2) 
where the transformed states are expressible in the original basis. If no subset of states 
transform only among themselves, the representation is irreducible. 
In addition, we want unitary representations. The reason for this is that the things we 
compute in field theory are matrix elements, 
(8.3) 
which should be Poincare invariant. If M is Poincare invariant, and I'l/Jl) and 1'l/J2) 
transform covaliantly under a Poincare transformation P, we find 
(8.4) 
So we need ptp = 1, which is the definition of unitarity. The unitary representations of 
the Poincare group are only a small subset of all the representations of the Poincare group. 
For example, as we will discuss, the 4-vector representation, AIL' is not unitary. But the 
unitary ones are the only ones from which we will be able to compute Poincare-invariant 
matrix elements, so we have to understand how to find them. Thus, 
Particles transform under irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. 
This statement can even be interpreted as the definition of what a particle is. Of course, 
many particles can transform under the same representation of the Poincare group. What 
makes two particles identical is discussed in Section 12.1. 
By the way, there is an even stronger requirement on physical theories: the S-matrix 
must be unitary. Requiring a unitary S-matrix constrains the dynamics of the theory, while 
demanding unitary representations of the Poincare group is just a statement about free-
particle states. Implications of unitarity of the S-matrix is the subject of Chapter 24. 
One way to think of the allocation into irreducible representations is that our universe 
is clearly filled with different kinds of particles in different states. By doing things such 
as putting an electron in a magnetic field, or sending a photon through a polarizer, we 
manipulate the momenta and spins. Some states will mix with each other under these 
manipulations and some will not. We look at the ilTeducible representations because those 
are the building blocks with which we can construct the most general description of nature. 

8.1 Unitary representations of the poincare group 
---------------------------------------------------
We already know some representations of the Poincare group: the constant tensors, ¢, 
V, Tp/l .... The, e ar~ rinite-dimen ional ~epre entati n ,with 1,4, 16, . . . ~ lem~nts. They

translation. Uni"ortunately the. e are not unllary representalion , as we will see below. In 
fact, [here ar 
110 jinite-dimellsionollillitcuy repl'eselllatiOIlS of the Poinclirt group. 
'[he unitary in'educible representations of the Poin are group were elas Hied by Eugene 
Wigner in 1939 [Wigner, 1939]. They are all infinite dimensional and naturally described 
by fields. As you might imagine, before Wigner people did not really know what the rules 
were for constructing physical theories, and by trial and error they were coming across 
all kinds of problems. Wigner showed that irreducible unitary representations are uniquely 
classified by mass m and spin J, where m is a non-negative real number and spin is a 
non-negative half integer, J = O,~, 1, ~, ... Moreover, Wigner showed that, if J > 0, 
for each value of the momentum with p2 = m 2 there are 2J + 1 independent states in 
the representation if m > 0 and exactly 2 states for m = 0. 1 These states correspond 
to linearly independent polarizations of particles with spin J. If J = 0 there is only one 
state for any m. You can find the proof ofWigner's theorem in [Weinberg, 1995]. We are 
not going to reproduce the proof. Instead, we will do some examples that will make the 
ingredients that go into the proof clear. 
Knowing what the representations of the Poincare group are is a great start, but we still 
have to figure out how to construct a unitary interacting theory of particles in these repre-
sentations. To do that, we would like to embed the irreducible representations into objects 
with space-time indices. That is, we want to squeeze states of spin 0, ~, 1, ~, 2 etc. into 
scalar fields ¢(x), vector fields V!-'(x), tensor fields T!-,v(x), spinor fields 1jJ(x) etc. That 
way we can write down simple-looking Lagrangians and develop general methods for 
doing calculations. We see an immediate complication: tensors have 1,4,16,64, ... ,4n 
elements, but spin states have 1,3,5,7, ... , 2j + 1 physical degrees of freedom. The 
embedding of the 2j + 1 states for a unitary representation in the 4n -dimensional tensors 
is tricky, and leads to things such as gauge invariance, as we will see in this chapter.2 
8.1.1 Unitarity versus Lorentz invariance 
We do not need fancy mathematics to see the conflict between unitarity and Lorentz invari-
ance. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, you have an electron with spin up Ii) or spin 
down 11). This is your basis, and you can have a state which is any linear combination of 
these two: 
(8.5) 
I To be accurate, there are also tachyon representations with m 2 < 0, and continuous spin representations for 
2 Tn = O. These exotic representations seem not to be realized in nature and we will not discuss them further. 
If we did not care to write down local Lagrangians, we could avoid introducing gauge invariance altogether. 
Alternate approaches based on using on-shell physical states only are discussed in Chapters 24 and 27. How-
ever, quantum field theory with gauge invariance remains the most complete method for studying massless 
spin-l particles. 
111 

112 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
The norm of such a state is 
(8.6) 
This norm is invariant under rotations, which send 
II) ----+ cos ell) + sin ell) , 
11) ----+ - sinell) + cosell)· 
(8.7) 
(In fact, the norm is invariant under the larger group SU(2), which you can see using the 
Pauli matrices, but that is not important right now.) 
Say we wanted to do the same thing with a basis of four states IVI") which transform as 
a 4-vector. Then an arbitrary linear combination would be 
(8.8) 
The norm of this state would be 
(8.9) 
This is the norm for any basis and it is always positive, which is one of the postulates of 
quantum mechanics. However, the norm is not Lorentz invariant. For example, suppose we 
start with 11,b) = IVa), which has norm (1,bI1,b) = 1. Then we boost in the 1 direction, so we 
get 11,b') = cosh,8IVa) + sinh,81V1)' Now the norm is 
(8.10) 
Thus, the probability of finding that a state is itself depends on what frame we are in! We 
see that the norm is not invariant under the boost. In terms of matrices, the boost matrix 
is not unitary: At -1= A-I. 
A = (COSh,8 
Sinh,8) 
sinh ,8 
cosh ,8 
One way out, you might suppose, could be to modify the norm to be 
(8.11) 
(8.12) 
This is Lorentz invariant, but not positive definite. That is not automatically a problem, 
since inner products in quantum mechanics are in general complex numbers. In fact, even 
with this norm the probability P = I (1,b 11,b) 12 ::::: 0 for any state. However, the probabilities 
will no longer be :S;1. For example, suppose 11,b) = IVa) so that (1,bI1,b) = 1 as before. Any 
state related to this one by a boost such as 11,b') = cosh ,8IVa) + sinh ,81V1) must also be in 
the Hilbert space, by Lorentz invariance. And (1,b'I1,b') = 1, by construction. However, the 
probability of finding 11,b') in the state 11,b) = IVa) is I (Va 11,b')12 = cosh2,8. Since for,8 cI-
0, cosh,8 > 1, there is no way to interpret this projection as a probability. Thus, because 
Lorentz transformations can mix positive norm and negative norm states, the probabilities 
are not bounded. In Problem 8.1, you can show that having a probability interpretation, 
with 0 :s; P :s; 1, requires us to have only positive (or only negative) norm states. So 
unitarity, with a positive definite norm, is critical to have any physical interpretation of 
quantum mechanics.

ate that V; = V0
2 - VI
2 - V2
2 -
V32 has one positive term and three negative terms. In 
;act, the vector representation of the Lorentz group VI" that is four-dimensional is the direct 
SulU of two irreducible representations: a spin-O representation, which is one-dimensional, 
and a spin-l representation, which is three-dimensional. If we could somehow project the 
spin-l (or spin-O) representation out of the reducible tensor representations (VI" or hl"v), 
then we might be able write down Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians for a theory with positive 
norlU. 
The second thing is that, while there are in fact no non-trivial finite-dimensional irre-
ducible unitary representations of the Poincare group, there are some infinite-dimensional 
ones. We will see that instead of constant basis vectors, such as (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0) etc., 
we will need a basis EI"(p) that depends on the momentum of the field. So the plan is to 
first see how to embed the right number of degrees of freedom for a particular mass and 
spin (irreducible representation of the Poincare group) into tensors such as AI"" Then we 
will see how the infinite dimensionality of the representation comes about. 
8.2 Embedding particles into fields 
In this section we explore how to construct Lagrangians for fields that contain only particles 
of single spins. We will start with the classical theory, where we cannot ask for unitarity 
(there is no classical norm) but we can ask for the energy to be positive definite, or more 
generally, bounded from below. Having both positive and negative energy states classically 
heralds disaster after quantization. For example, if photons could have positive and negative 
energy, the vacuum could decay into pairs of photons with pi + p~ = O. This process does 
not violate energy or momentum conservation; it is normally only forbidden by photons 
having positive energies. An alternative criterion for determining whether a classical theory 
would be non-unitary when quantized is discussed in Section 8.7. 
The classical energy density E is given by the 00 component of the energy-momentum 
tensor, which was calculated in Section 3.3.1, Eq. (3.36), to be 
(8.13) 
The energy is E = J d3x E. 

114 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
8.2.1 Spin 0 
For spin 0, the embedding is easy, we just put the one degree of freedom into a J = 0 
scalar field ¢( x). The Lagrangian is 
(8.14) 
which is Lorentz invariant and transforms covariantly under translations. The equation of 
motion is 
(8 .15) 
which has solutions ¢ = e±ipx with p2 = m 2 . So this field has mass m. The Lagrangian 
is unique up to an overall constant for which the conventional normalization is given. 
The energy density corresponding to this Lagrangian is given by 
(8.16) 
This is a positive definite quantity and bounded from below by O. Thus the overall sign in 
the scalar Lagrangian is consistent with positive energy. 
8.2.2 Massive spin 1 
For spin 1, there are three degrees of freedom if m > O. This is a mathematical result, 
which we will not derive formally, but we will see how it works in practice. The smallest 
tensor field we could possibly embed these three degrees of freedom in is a vector field 
Afl which has four components. Sometimes we write 4 = 3 EEl 1 to indicate that the four-
dimensional representation of the Lorentz group is the direct sum of three-dimensional 
(spin-I) and one-dimensional (spin-O) representations ofthe rotation group 80(3). A com-
plete mathematical classification of the representations of the Lorentz group will be given 
in Chapter 10. In this chapter we will take the more physical approach of trying to engineer 
a Lagrangian that engenders a positive definite energy density, which we will see requires 
removing the spin-O degree of freedom. 
A natural guess for the Lagrangian for a massive spin-l field is 
(8.17) 
where A~ = AflAiL. Then the equations of motion are 
(8.18) 
which has four propagating modes. In fact, this Lagrangian is not the Lagrangian for a 
massive spin-l field, but the Lagrangian for four massive scalar fields, Ao, AI, A2 and A3 . 
That is, we have reduced 4 = 1 EEl 1 EEl 1 EEl 1, which is not what we wanted. The energy 
density in this case is 

8.2 Embedding particles into fields 
----------------------------------------------
O£' 
[; c== O( OtAIL) OtAIL - £, 
c== -~ [(OtAo)2 + ('~ Ao)2 + m 2 A~] + ~ [(Ot A)2 + (Vi Aj)2 + m 2 A2] , 
(8.19) 
which has a negative sign for the Ao field and a positive sign for the A fields. If we switched 
the overall sign, we would still have some fields with negative energy. So this Lagrangian 
will not produce a physical theory. 
By the way, you may wonder how we know if AIL transforms as a vector or as four 
scalars, since the Lagrangian is invariant under both transformations. That is, why did we 
get four scalars when we wanted a vector? As a very general statement, we do not get to 
impose symmetries on a theory. We just pick the Lagrangian, then we let the theory go. 
lf there are symmetries, and the Lagrangian is constructed correctly to preserve them, the 
symmetries will hold up in matrix elements in the full interacting theory. This is true even 
if we never figured out that the symmetries were there. For example, Maxwell's equations 
are Lorentz invariant. They work the same way if you have E and 13 instead of AIL" The 
Lorentz invariance is then obscure, but it still works. In fact, a very important tool in making 
progress in physics has been to observe symmetries in a physical result, such as a matrix 
element, then to go back and figure out why they are there at a deeper level, which leads 
to generalizations. That happened with Maxwell for electromagnetism, with Einstein for 
special and general relativity, with Fermi, Feynman, Glashow, Weinberg and Salam for the 
V - A theory of weak interactions, with Gell-Mann for the quark model, and in many other 
cases. 
Back to massive spin 1. There is one more Lorentz-invariant two-derivative kinetic term 
we can write down with the same dimension,3 AlLolLovAv. Allowing arbitrary coefficients 
for the different possible terms, the most general free Lagrangian is 
(8.20) 
where a and b are numbers. As long as b is non-zero, the 0ILAIL contraction forces AIL to 
transform as a 4-vector; if AIL transformed as four scalars, 0ILAIL would not be Lorentz 
invariant. Thus, we should now have 4 = 3 EB 1 instead of 4 = 1 EB 1 EB 1 EB 1 and have a 
chance to get rid of the one degree of freedom corresponding to spin 0, isolating the three 
degrees of freedom for a spin-l particle. 
The equations of motion are 
(8.21) 
Taking OIL of this equation gives 
(8.22) 
3 Terms with more derivatives such as AI" 0 2 AI" can also be considered, but they will always lead to negative 
energy. A simple explanation of this fact is given in Section 8.7 and a complete proof is given in Section 24.2. 
115 

116 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
If a = -b and m =1= 0, this reduces to ofJ.AfJ. = 0, which removes one degree of freedom. 
Since ofJ.AfJ. = 0 is a Lorentz-invariant condition, it has to remove a complete representa-
tion, which with one degree of freedom can only be the spin-O component. Taking a = 1 
and b = -1, we find 
(8.23) 
where the Maxwell tensor is FfJ.v = ofJ.AV - ovAw This is sometimes called. the Proca 
Lagrangian. Note that we did not say anything here about gauge invariance or electromag-
netism, we just derived that FfJ.v appears based on constructing a Lagrangian that generates 
a constraint to propagate only the spin-l field by removing the spin-O field. The equations 
of motion now imply (0 + m 2 ) AfJ. = 0 and ofJ.AfJ. = O. 
The energy-momentum tensor for the Proca Lagrangian is 
O£ 
(1 2 1 2 2) 
TfJ.V = o(ofJ.A,) ovA" - 9fJ.v £ = -FfJ.c>DvA,Ji + 9fJ.V 4F"/3 - 2m A" . 
(8.24) 
To simplify this, we will use the classical result (which you are encouraged to check) that 
the Maxwell action can be written as 
_ ~ F2 = ~ (£2 _ j32) 
4 fJ.V 
2 
' 
(8.25) 
(8.26) 
This looks like it has negative energy components. However, we can rewrite this energy 
density in the suggestive form 
[; = ~ (£2 + j32) + ~ m 2 ( A6 + 12) 
+ Aoot(ofJ.AfJ.) - Ao(O + m 2 )Ao + oi(AoFoi)' 
(8.27) 
The second line is the sum of three terms. The first two vanish on the equations of motion 
ofJ.AfJ. = 0 and (0 + m 2)Ao = O. Since the equations of motion were already used in the 
derivation of the energy-momentum tensor in Noether's theorem, we can use them again 
here. The final term is a total spatial derivative. Thus, while it contributes to the energy 
density, it makes no contribution to the total energy. Therefore, the total energy of the 
fields in the Proca Lagrangian is positive definite, as desired. 
Let us now find explicit solutions to the equations of motion. We start by Fourier 
transforming our (classical) fields. Since (0 + m 2 ) AfJ. = 0, we can write any solution as

conventionally normalize the polarizations by E~ E/1- = -l. 
To be explicit, let us choose a canonical basis. Take p/1- to point in the z direction, 
p/1- = (E,O,O,pz), 
then two obvious vectors satisfying P/1-E/1- = ° and E~ = -1 are 
E~ = (0,1,0, 0), 
E~ = (0,0,1,0). 
These are the transverse polarizations. The other one is 
L 
(pz 
E) 
E/1- = 
m'O,O, m 
. 
(8.29) 
(8.30) 
(8.31) 
This is the longitudinal polarization. It is easy to check that (E~)2 = -1 and P/1-E~ = 0. 
These three polarization vectors E~ (p) generate the irreducible representation. The basis 
vectors depend on p/1-, and since there are an infinite number of possible momenta, it is an 
infinite-dimensional representation. The vector space generated by integrating these basis 
vectors against arbitrary Fourier components ai (p) in Eq. (8.28) is the space of fields sat-
isfying the equations of motion, which form an infinite-dimensional unitary representation 
of the Poincare group. 
By the way, massive spin-l fields are not a purely theoretical concept: they exist! There 
is one called the p meson, which is lighter than the proton, but unstable, so we do not 
often see it. More importantly, there are really heavy ones, the Wand Z bosons, which 
mediate the weak force and radioactivity. We will study them in great detail, particularly 
in Chapter 29. But there is an important feature of these heavy bosons that is easy to see 
already. At high energy, E » m, the longitudinal polarization becomes 
L 
E 
E/1- rv -
(1,0,0,1). 
(8.32)

If we scatter these modes, we might have a cross section whose high-energy behavior scales 
as deJ rv g2 (EL) 2 rv g2 !~ , where g is the coupling constant (an explicit example where 
this really happens is the theory of weak interactions described in Chapter 29). Then, no 
matter how small g is, if we go to high enough energies, this cross section blows up. How-
ever, cross sections cannot be arbitrarily big. After all, they are probabilities, which are 
bounded by l. So, at some scale, what we are calculating becomes not a very good rep-
resentation of what is really going on. In other words, our perturbation theory is breaking 
down. We can see already that this happens at E rv ~. If m rv 100 GeV and g rv 0.1, cor-
responding to the mass and coupling strength of the Wand Z bosons (which are massive 
spin-l particles) we find E rv 1 TeV. That is why the TeV scale has been the focus of the 
!evatron and Large Hadron Colliders. A longer discussion of perturbative unitary violation 
IS given in Sections 24.l.5 and 29.2.

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
Also, the fact that there is a spin-l particle in this Lagrangian follows completely froIn 
the Lagrangian itself - we never have to impose any additional constraints. In fact, we did 
not have to talk about spin, or Lorentz invariance at all- all the properties associated with 
that spin would just have fallen out when we tried to calculate physical quantities. That 
is the beauty of symmetries: they work even if you do not know about them! It would be 
fine to think of AI-' as four scalar fields that happen to conspire so that when you compute 
something in one frame, certain ones contribute, and when you compute in a different 
frame, other ones contribute, but the final answer is frame independent. Obviously it is a 
lot easier to do the calculation if we know this ahead of time, so we can choose a nice 
frame, but in no way is it required. 
8.2.3 Massless spin 1 
The easiest way to come up with a theory of massless spin-l is to simply take the m ~ 0 
limit of the massive spin-l theory. Then the Lagrangian becomes 
1 
2 
£ = - 4Fl-'v, 
(8.33) 
which is the Lagrangian for electrodynamics, confirming that we are on the right track. 
Unfortunately, the massless limit is not quite as smooth as we would like. First of all, 
the constraint equation m2(o/.LAI-') = 0 is automatically satisfied for m = 0, so we no 
longer automatically have 0l-'AI-' = O. Thus, it seems the spin-O mode we removed should 
now be back. Another problem with the massless limit is that as m ~ 0 the longitudinal 
polarization blows up: 
L 
(pz 
E) 
EI-' = 
m'O,O, m 
~ 00. 
Partly, this is due to normalization. In the massless limit, pz ~ 
becomes lightlike, that is, 
PI-' ~ (E, 0, 0, E) , 
(8.34) 
E and the momentum 
(8.35) 
so a more invariant statement is that E~ ~ PI-' up to normalization. Finally, we expect from 
representation theory that there should only be two polarizations for a massless spin-l par-
ticle, so the spin-O and the longitudinal mode should somehow decouple from the physical 
system. 
Instead of trying to analyze what happens to the massive modes, let us just postulate the 
Lagrangian and start over with analyzing the degrees of freedom. So we start with 
1 
2 
£ = -4Fl-'v, 
FI-'v = ol-'Av - OvAl-" 
(8.36) 
This Lagrangian has an important property that the massive Lagrangian did not have: 
gauge invariance. It is invariant under the transformation 
(8.37) 
for any function a (x). Thus, two fields AI-' that differ by the derivative of a scalar are 
physically equivalent. 

8.2 Embedding particles into fields 
---
The equations of motion following from the Lagrangian are 
This is really four equations and it is helpful to separate out the 0 and i components: 
-oj Ao + at OJ Aj = 0, 
(8.39) 
DAi - oi(OtAO - ojAj) = 0. 
(8.40) 
To count the physical degrees of freedom, let us use the freedom of transforming the fields 
in Eq. (8.37) to impose constraints on Af.L, a procedure known as gauge-fixing. Since 
8Aj -+ ojAj + ala, unless ojAj is singular we can choose a so that ojAj = 0, known 
a~ Coulomb gauge. Then the Ao equation of motion becomes 
oj Ao = 0, 
(8.41) 
which has no time derivative. Now, under gauge transformations oiAi --7 oiAi + ala, so 
Coulomb gauge is preserved under Af.L --7 Af.L + of.La for any a satisfying ora = O. Since 
Ao -+ Ao + Ota and Ao also satisfies or Ao = 0 we have exactly the residual symmetry we 
need to set Ao = 0. Thus, we have eliminated one degree of freedom from Af.L completely, 
and we are down to three. One more to go! 
In Coulomb gauge, the other equations reduce to 
(8.42) 
which seem to propagate three modes. But do not forget that Ai is constrained by oiAi = 0. 
In Fourier space 
A ( ) - J d

(8.43) 
and the equations become p2 = 0 (equations of motion), PiEi = 0 (gauge choice), and EO = 
° 
(gauge choice). Choosing a frame, we can write the momentum as Pf.L = (E, 0, 0, E). 
Then these equations have two solutions, 
E~ = (0,1,0, 0), 
E~ = (0,0,1,0), 
(8.44) 
which represent linearly polarized light. Thus, we have constructed a theory propagating 
only two degrees of freedom, as is appropriate for irreducible unitary representations of a 
massless spin-1 particle. 
Another common basis for the transverse polarizations of light is 
(8.45) 
These polarizations correspond to circularly polarized light and are called helicity eigen-
states. 
We could also have used Lorenz gauge (of.LAf.L = 0), in which case we would have found 
that three vectors satisfy Pf.LEf.L = 0: 
E~ = (0,1,0, 0), 
E~ = (0,0,1, 0), 
E~ = (1,0,0,1). 
(8.46) 
119 

120 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
The first two modes are the physical transverse polarizations. The third apparent solution 
denoted f£ is called the forward polarization. It does not correspond to a physical state. 
One way to see this is to note that E£ is not normalizable «( f£)* E£ = 0). Another way is to 
note that EI" ex Pl",which corresponds to A I" = al"¢ for some ¢. This field configuration is 
gauge-equivalent to A I" = 0 (choose a = -¢ in Eg. (8.37)). Thus, the forward polarization 
corresponds to a field configuration that is pure gauge. Similarly, if we had not imposed 
the second Coulomb gauge condition, EO = 0, we would have found another polarization 
satisfying PiCi = 0 is fa = (1,0,0,0). This timelike polarization cannot be normalized 
so that( E~) * EL = - i5ij , since fa is timelike, and is therefore unphysical. 
8.2.4 Summary 
To summarize, for massive spin 1, we chose the kinetic term be - i F;:v + ~m 
2 A~ in order 
to enforce al"AI" = 0, which eliminated one degree of freedom from AI"' leaving the three 
for massive spin-I. We found that the energy density is positive definite if and only if the 
Lagrangian has this form, up to an overall normalization. The Lagrangian for a massive 
spin-1 particle does not have gauge invariance, but we still need F;:v-
For the massless case, having F;:v gives us gauge invariance. This allows us to remove 
an additional polarization, leaving two, which is the correct number for a massless spin-1 
representation of the Poincare group. 
For both massive and massless spin 1, we found a basis of polarization vectors E~ (p), 
with i = 1, 2, 3 for m > 0 and i = 1, 2 for m = O. The fact that the polarizations depend on 
pI" make these infinite-dimensional representations. The representation of the full Poincare 
group is induced by a representation of the subgroup of the Poincare group that holds pI" 
fixed, called the little group. The little group has finite-dimensional representations. For 
the massive case, the little group, holding for example pI" = (m, 0, 0, 0) fixed (or any other 
4-vector of mass m), is just the group of three-dimensional rotations, 80(3). 80(3) has 
finite-dimensional irreducible representations of spin J with 2J + 1 degrees of freedom. 
For the massless case, the group that holds a massless 4-vector such as (E, 0, 0, E) fixed 
is the group ISO(2) (the isometry group of the two-dimensional Euclidean plane), which 
has representations of spin J with two degrees of freedom for each J. Studying represen-
tations of the little group is the easiest way to prove Wigner's classification. Rather than 
work through the mathematics, we will understand the little group and induced represen-
tations through example, particularly in Section 8.4 below. The little group is revisited in 
Chapters 10 and 27. 
8.3 Covariant derivatives 
In order not to affect our counting of degrees of freedom, the interactions in the Lagrangian 
must respect gauge invariance. For example, you might try to add an interaction 
(8.47) 
but this is not invariant. Under the gauge transformation 

8.3 Covariant derivatives 
----------------------------------------------------------
(8.48) 
In fact, it is impossible to couple AIL to any field with only one degree of freedom, such 
as the scalar field ¢. We must be able to make ¢ transform to compensate for the gauge 
transformation of AIL' in order to cancel the alLa term. But if there is only one field ¢, it 
has nothing to mix with so it cannot transform. 
Thus, we need at least two fields ¢l and ¢2. It is easiest to deal with such a doublet by 
putting them together into a complex field ¢ = ¢l + i¢2, and then to work with ¢ and ¢*. 
Under a gauge transformation, ¢ can transform as 
(8.49) 
which makes m2¢*¢ gauge invariant. But what about the derivatives? laIL¢1 2 is not 
invariant. 
We can in fact make the kinetic term gauge invariant using something we call a covariant 
derivative. Adding a conventional constant e to the transformation of AIL' so AIL ---+ AIL + 
~8ILa, we find 
(aIL + ieAIL )¢ ---+ (aIL + ieAIL + iaILa)e-io:(x)¢ = e-io:(x) (aIL + ieAIL )¢· 
(8.50) 
This leads us to define the covariant derivative as 
D IL¢ = (aIL + ieAIL )¢ ---+ e-io:(x) D IL¢, 
(8.51) 
which transforms just like the field does. Thus 
L = -~F;l/ + (DIL¢)*(DIL¢) - m2¢*¢ 
(8.52) 
is gauge invariant. This is the Lagrangian for scalar QED. 
More generally, different fields ¢n can have different charges Qn and transform as 
(8.53) 
Then the covariant derivative is DIL¢n = (aIL - ieQnAIL) ¢n, where in Eq. (8.51) we have 
taken Q = -1 for ¢, thinking of it as an electron with charge -1. Thus, we write Q for 
the charges of the fields, and e is the strength of the electric charge, normalized so that 
Q = -1 for the electron, whence 1: ~ 1~7 is the normal fine-structure constant.4 Until 
we deal with quarks (for which Q = ~ or Q = - i), we will not write Q explicitly, and 
we will just take DIL = aIL + ieAw 
By the way, there is also a beautiful geometric way to understand covariant derivatives, 
similar to how they are understood in general relativity. Since the phase of ¢ is unobserv-
able, one can pick different phase conventions in different regions without consequence. 
Thus ¢(x) - ¢(y) or even I¢(x) - ¢(Y)I is not well defined. The gauge field records the 
change in our phase convention from point to point, with a gauge transformation repre-
senting a change in this convention. Turning these words into mathematics leads to the 
notion of Wilson lines, which will play an important role in non-Abelian gauge theories. 
4 It is interesting to note that the electric charge itself is e ~ 0.3 ~ ~, which is not actually that small. Doing an 
expansion in ~ is also popular in QeD, where 3 = Nc is the number of colors.

122 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
Thus, we postpone the detailed discussion of this interpretation of covariant derivatives 
until Chapter 25. 
8.3.1 Gauge symmetries and conserved currents 
Symmetries parametrized by a function such as a (x) are called gauge or local symme. 
tries, while if they are only symmetries for constant a they are called global symmetries. 
For gauge symmetries, we can pick a separate transformation at each point in space-time. 
A gauge symmetry automatically implies a global synunetry. Global symmetries imply 
conserved cunents by Noether's theorem. For example, the Lagrangian L = -¢*O¢ of a 
free complex scalar field is not gauge invariant, but it does have a symmetry under which 
¢ ----> e-ia ¢ for a constant a and it does have an associated Noether cunent. 
Let us see how the Noether cunent changes when the gauge field is included. Expanding 
out the scalar QED Lagrangian, Eq. (8.52), gives 
L = -~F;v + 0/J-¢*0/J-¢ + ieA/J-(¢0/J-¢* - ¢*o/J-¢) + e2 A~¢*¢ - m2¢*¢. 
(8.54) 
The equations of motion are 
(0 + m2) ¢ = -2ieA/J-0/J-¢ + e2 A~¢, 
(0 + m2) ¢* = 2ieA/J-0/J-¢* + e2 A~¢*. 
(8.55) 
(8.56) 
The Noether current associated with the global symmetry for which ~! = -i¢ and 88":: = 
i¢* is (using Eq. (3.23)) 
J/J- = L O(:/J-~n) 0:;: = -i(¢0/J-¢* - ¢*o/J-¢) - 2eA/J-¢*¢' 
(8.57) 
n 
The first term on the right-hand side is the Noether cunent in the free theory (e = 0). You 
should check this full current is also conserved on the equations of motion. 
By the way, you might have noticed that the term in the scalar QED Lagrangian linear 
in A/J- is just -eA/J-J w There is a quick way to see why this will happen in general. Define 
La as the limit of a gauge-invariant Lagrangian when A/J- = 0 (or equivalently e = 0). La 
will still be invariant under the global symmetry for which A/J- is the gauge field, since A/J-
does not transform when a is constant. If we then let a be a function of x, the transformed 
La can only depend on 0/J-a. Thus, for infinitesimal a(x), 
(8.58) 
for some Jw For example, in scalar QED with A/J- = 0, La = (0/J-¢)*(0/J-¢) - m2¢*¢ and 
OLo = (0/J-a)J/J- + (o/J-a)2 ¢*¢, 
(8.59) 
with J/J- given by Eq. (8.57). Returning to the general theory, after integration by parts the 
term linear in a is oLo = a0/J-Jw Since the variation of the Lagrangian vanishes on the 
equations of motion for any transformation, including this one parametrized by a, we must 
have 0/J-J/J- = 0 implying that J/J- is conserved. In fact, J/J- is the Noether current, since we 
have just rederived Noether's theorem a different way. To make the Lagrangian invariant 

8.4 Quantization and the Ward identity

witbDut using the equations of motion, we can add a field AI-' with bAI-' = al-'a and define 
C ::::: Co - AI-'JI-' so that 
b.C = .co - bAI-'JI-' = (aJLa) JJL - (aJLa) JJL = O.

Bence, the coupling AJLJJL between a gauge field and a 
oelher current i generi and 
universal. In scalar field theory there is also a term quadratic in A,L required to cancel the 
(81-'0'.)2 term in Eq. (8.59). In spinor QED, as we will ee, there i . ju L lhe linear ferm. 
8.4 Quantization and the Ward identity 
To quantize fields with multiple degrees of freedom, we simply need creation and annihi-
lation operators for each degree separately. For example, if we have two spin-O fields, we 
can write 
,J, (

Then the complex field ¢ = ¢1 + i¢2 can be written in the suggestive form as a real 
doublet: 
(8.63) 
with E1 = G) and E2 = G)' In this notation you can think of fj as the polarization 
vectors of the complex scalar field. To quantize spin-l fields, we will just allow for the 
polarizations to be in a basis that has four components instead of two and can depend on 
momentum fj ---t Ej (p).

There are separate creation and annihilation operators for each of the polarizations, and we

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
The creation and annihilation operators have polarization indices. To specify OUr 
asymptotic states we will now need to give both the momentum and the polarization. So

(8.65) 
Up to normalization. Thus 
(8.66) 
so our field creates a particle at position x whose polarization can be projected out with the 
appropriate contraction. 
Recall that the basis has to depend on pI' because there are no finite-dimensional unitary 
representations of the Lorentz group. To see it again, let us suppose instead that we tried 
to pick constants for our basis vectors. Say, E1 = (0,1,0, 0), E~ = (0,0,1,0) and E~ === 
(0,0,0,1). The immediate problem is that this basis is not complete, because under Lorentz 
transformations 
(8.67) 
so that for boosts these will mix with the timelike polarization (1,0,0,0). 
We saw from solving the classical equations of motion that we can choose a momentum-
dependent basis E1 (p), E~ (p) and E~ (p). For example, for the massive case, for PI' pointing 
in the z direction, 
pI" = (E,O,O,pz), 
(8.68) 
we can use the basis 
E'{(p) = (0,1,0,0), 
Ei(p) = (0,0,1,0), 
E'{(p) = (~, 0, 0, !). 
(8.69) 
which all satisfy E~E~ = - 1 and E~PI' = 0. 
What happened to the fourth degree of freedom in the vector representation? The vec-
tor orthogonal to these is E~(p) = 
~pl" = 
(~,O,O, ;,). In position space, this is 
E~ = 
~8ILa(x) for some scalar function a(x). So we do not want to include this spin-O 
polarization E~ (p) in the sum in Eq. (8.64). To see that the polarization based on the scalar 
a( x) does not mix with the other three is easy: if something is the divergence of a function 
a (x), under a Lorentz transformation it will still be the divergence of the same function, 
just in a different frame. So the polarizations in the spin-l representation (the E~'S) do not 
mix with the polarization in the spin-O representation, E~. 
Now, you may wonder, if we are redefining our basis with every boost, so that E1(p) ---t 
E1(pl), E~(p) ---t E~(pl), and E~(p) ---+ E~(pl), when do the polarization vectors ever mix? 
Have we gone too far and just made four separate one-dimensional representations? The 
answer is that there aroe Lorentz transformations that leave PI" alone, and therefore leave 
our basis alone. These are, by definition, the elements of the little group. For little-group 
transformations, we need to check that our basis vectors rotate into each other and form a 
complete representation. For example, suppose we go to the frame 
ql" = (m, 0, 0, 0). 
(8.70)

8.4 Quantization and the Ward identity

Tben we can choose our polarization basis vectors as

millions i to mix up the polarization vectors at fixed PI" So the spin-l representation i 
characterized by this smaller group, the little group, which is the subgroup of the Lorentz 
group that leaves PI" unchanged. This method of studying representations of the Lorentz 
group is called the method of induced representations. 
The little group also helps resolve the conflict between Lorentz invariance and unitarity 
discussed in Section 8.1.1. In quantum mechanics, we can expand any polarization in this 
basis. Let us fix the momentum ql". Then, any physical polarization vector EI" can be written 
as 
(8.72) 
corresponding to the state IE) = CjlJ). Since the basis states all have (jlj) = 1, we find 
(8.73) 
This inner product is rotation invariant, by the defining property of rotations, and boost 
invariant in a trivial way: under boosts the Cj'S do not change because the basis vectors Ei 
do. Thus, (EIE) is positive definite and Lorentz invariant. 
In quantum field theory, we will be calculating matrix elements with the field AI"' These 
matrix elements will depend on the polarization vector and must have the form 
(8.74) 
where M I" transforms as a 4-vector. Here, EI" is the polarization vector, which can be any of 
the Ei or any linear combination of them. For example, say we start with E1. Now change 
frames, so MI" ----7 M~ = Al"vMv. Then the matrix element is invariant: 
(8.75) 
where E~ (pi) = Al"v Ev (Ao:f3pf3). This new polarization E~ (pi) is still a physical state in our 
Hilbert space, since the basis is closed under the Lorentz group. More simply, we can say 
that EI"MI" is Lorentz invariant on the restricted space of 4-vectors fl"(p) = CjEi(p). This 
Sounds pretty obvious, but having understood the massive case in this language will greatly 
facilitate understanding the massless case, which is much more subtle.

A sample basis is, for plk in the z direction, 
plk = (E ,O,O, E), 
Ei(p) = (0, I, 0, 0), 
Ei(p) = (0,0, 1, 0). 
These satisfy (E~ ) 2 = -1 and E~PIk = 0. The two orthogonal polarizations are 
Ej (p) = (1,0,0,1), 
E~t(p) = (1,0,0,-1), 
where f and b stand for forward and backward.

(8.78) 
(8.79) 
But now we have a problem. Even though there is an irreducible unitary representation 
of massless spin-l particles involving two polarizations, it is impossible to embed these 
polarizations in vector fields like EW To see the problem, recall that in the massive case 
E1 and E~ mixed not only with each other under the little group SO(3), that is, Lorentz 
transformations preserving plk = (E, 0, O,Pz), but they also mixed with the longitudinal 
mode Ej, (p) = (~, O , O , ff; ). We saw this because icl l2 + IC212 + icLI2 is invariant under 
this SO(3), but ICli2 + IC212 itself would not be. There is nothing particularly discontinuous 
about the m ---+ ° limit. The momentum goes to Plk = (E, 0, 0, E) and the longitudinal 
mode becomes the same as our forward-polarized photon, up to normalization 
lim E~(p) = E~(p ) ex pw 
m--->O 
(8.80) 
The little group goes to ISO(2) in the massless case. There are still little-group members 
that mix E~ and E~ with the other polarization, Et (p) = Pw In general

This satisfies AT gA = g, so it is a Lorentz transformation. It also has A~pv = plk so it 
preserves the momentum plk = (E, 0, 0, E). Thus, this A is an honest member of the little 
group. However,

(11 NoW, consider the kind of matrix element we w uld gel from scattering a photon using 
the field Ai-" It would, just like the massive case, be 
M = El"lvfl") 
(8.85) 
where now EI" is some linear combination of the two physical polarizations E~ and E~. 
Then, under a Lorentz transformation,

is not. For example, under the explicit Lorentz transformation above, 
1 
(1 
1 
) 
I 
M = EI"MI" -> 
EI" + EPI" Mw 
(8.87) 
So we have a problem. The state with polarization f~ + ~PI" is not in our Hilbert space! 
Thus, there is no physical polarization for which the matrix element is the same in the new 
frame as it was in the old frame. There is only one way out - if PI"MI" = O. Then there is a 
physical polarization that gives the same matrix element and M is invariant. Thus, to have 
a Lorentz-invariant theory with a massless spin-l particle, we must have PI"MJ.' = O. 
This is extremely important and worth repeating. We have found that under Lorentz 
transformations the massless polatizations transform as 
(8.88) 
Generally, this transformed polarization is not physical and not in our Hilbert space because 
ofthe Pit term. The best we can do is transform it into f~ = C1 f~ + C2 E~. When we calculate 
something in QED we will get matrix elements 
(8.89) 
for some Mit transforming like a Lorentz vector. If we Lorentz transform this expression 
we will get 
(8.90) 
It is therefore only possible for M to be Lorentz invariant if M = E~M~, which happens 
only if 
(8.91) 
This is known as the Ward identity. The Ward identity must hold by Lorentz invariance 
and the fact that unitary representations for massless spin-l particles have two polariza-
tions. We did not show that it holds, only that it must hold in a reasonable physical theory. 
That it holds in QED is complicated to show in perturbation theory, but we will sketch the 
ingredients in the next chapter. We will eventually prove it non-perturbatively using path 
127

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
integrals in Chapter 14. The Ward identity is closely related to gauge invariance. Since the 
Lagrangian is invariant under AIL -+ AIL + 8IL Q;, in momentum space this should directly 
imply that ElL -+ ElL + PIL is a symmetry of the theory, which is the Ward identity. 
8.5 The photon propagator 
In order to calculate anything with a photon, we are going to need to know its propagator 
IIILv, defined by 
(8.92) 
evaluated in the free theory. The easiest way to calculate the propagator is to solve for the 
classical Green's function and then add the time ordering with the is prescription, as for a 
scalar. 
Let us first try to calculate the classical Green's function by using the equations of 
motion, without choosing a gauge. In the presence of a current, the equations of motion 
following from £: = -~F;:v - AlLllL are 
(8.93) 
so 
(8.94) 
or in momentum space, 
(8.95) 
We would like to write AIL = IIILvlv, so that (_p2gILv + PILPv)lIvD! = gILD!. That is, we 
want to invert the kinetic term. The problem is that 
(8.96) 
which follows since _p2gILv + PVPIL has a zero eigenvalue, with eigenvector PIL. Because it 
has a zero eigenvalue, the kinetic term cannot be invertible, just as for a finite-dimensional 
linear operator. The non-invertibility is a manifestation of gauge invariance: AIL is not 
uniquely determined by lp,; different gauges will give different values for Ap, from the 
same lp,-
So what do we do? We could try to just choose a gauge, for example 8IL Ap, = O. This 
would reduce the Lagrangian to 
1 
1 
- 4F p,v -+ "2Ap,DAp,-
(8.97) 
However, now it seems there are four propagating degrees of freedom in Ap, instead of two. 
In fact, you can do this, but you have to keep track of the gauge constraint 8p,AIL = 0 all

long. A cleaner solution, which more easily generalizes to non-Abelian theories, is to add 
a neW auxiliary (non-propagating) field that acts like a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the 
~onstraint through the equations of motion:

(8.98) 
(Writing "* instead of ~ is just a convention.) The equations of motion for ~ are just 
8 AJ1 = 0, which was the Lorenz gauge constraint. In different words, for very small 
~~here is a tremendous pressure on the Lagrangian to have o,..AJ1 = 0 to stay near the 
minimum. 
With the ~ term, the equations of motion for AJ1 are 
(8.99) 
Although not obvious, but easy to check, the inverse of the operator in brackets is 
(8.100) 
To check, we calculate 
[_p2 gw' + (1- ~ ) pJ1Pa] llav = [p2 g,..a - ( 1 - ~ ) pJ1pa] [p2 gav - (1 - ~)PaPv ] :4 
= gJ1V + [- ( 1 - ~ ) - (1 - ~) + ( 1 - ~) (1 -0] P;;v 
(8.101) 
The time-ordered Feynman propagator for a photon can be derived just as for a scalar 
field (Problem 8.4) with the result 
(8.102) 
This is the photon propagator in covariant or R~-gauge. 
As with the scalar propagator, the ic is a quick way to combine the advanced and 
retarded propagators into the time-ordered propagator. The sign for the numerator can be 
remembered using 
(

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
8.5.1 Covariant gauges 
In the covariant gauges, each choice of ~ gives a different Lorentz-invariant gauge. Some 
useful gauges are: 
• Feynman-'t Rooft gauge ~ = 1: 
. I"V 
iIII"V(p) = ~. 
p2 + ZE 
This is the gauge we will use for most calculations. 
• Lorenz gauge ~ = 0: 
gl"V _ ~ 
iIII"V(p) = -i 
.p 
p2 + ZE 
(8.104) 
(8.105) 
We saw that ~ ---+ 0 forces 0I"AI" = O. Note that we could not set ~ = 0 and then invert 
the kinetic term, but we can invert and then set ~ = O. 
• Unitary gauge ~ ---+ 00. This gauge is useless for QED, since the propagator blows up. 
But it is extremely useful for the gauge theory of the weak interactions. 
Other non-covariant gauges are occasionally useful. Lightcone gauge, with nl"AI" = 0 
for some fixed lightlike 4-vector nl" is occasionally handy if there is a preferred direction. 
For example, in situations with multiple collinear fields, such as the quarks inside a fast-
moving proton, lightcone gauge is useful (see Section 32.5 and Chapter 36). Coulomb 
gauge, \7. A = 0, and radial or Fock-Schwinger gauge, x I" AI" (x) = 0, also facilitate some 
calculations. For QED we will stick to covariant gauges. 
The final answer for any Lorentz-invariant quantity had better be gauge invariant. In 
covariant gauges, 
iIII"V(p) = ~ 
[gl"V _ (1 _ ~)PI"PV] . 
p2 + ZE 
p2 
(8.106) 
This means the final answer should be independent of ~. Thus, whatever we contract IIl"v 
with should give 0 if IIl"v ex PI"Pv' This is very similar to the requirement of the Ward 
identities, which say that the matrix elements vanish if the physical external polarization 
is replaced by EI" ---+ PI"" We will sketch a diagrammatic proof of gauge invariance in the 
next chapter, and give a full non-perturbative proof of both gauge invariance and the Ward 
identity in Chapter 14 on path integrals. 
8.6 Is gauge invariance real? 
Gauge invariance is not physical. It is not observable and is not a symmetry of nature. 
Global symmetries are physical, since they have physical consequences, namely conserva-
tion of charge. That is, we measure the total charge in a region, and if nothing leaves that 
region, whenever we measure it again the total charge will be exactly the same. There is no 
such thing that you can actually measure associated with gauge invariance. We introduce 
gauge invariance to have a local description of massless spin-l particles. The existence of

ese particles, with only two polarizations, is physical, but the gauge invariance is merely 
til edundancy of description we introduce to be able to describe the theory with a local 
a f 
Lagrangian.

~ould be the interactions of the gauge field with itself in gravity or in Yang-Mills lh aries 
(ChapterS 25 and 26). The controlled way that gauge invariance is broken, particularly 
by the introduction of covariant gauges, is critical to proving renormalizability of gauge 
theories, as we will see in Chapter 21. 
A useful toy model that may help distinguish gauge invariance (artificial) from the 
physical spectrum (real) is 
1 
2 
1 
2 
2 
1: = - 4Fl-'v + 2m (AI-' + 01-'7f) . 
(8.107) 
This has a gauge invariance under which AI-'(x) ---) AI-'(x) + 0l-'o:(x) and 7f(x) ---) 7f(x) -
ll(X). However, we can use that symmetry to set 7f = 0 everywhere. Then the Lagrangian 
reduces to that of a massive gauge boson. So the physics is that of three polarizations of 
a massive spin-l particle. When 7f is included there are still three degrees of freedom, but 
noW these are two polarizations in AI-' and one in 7f, with the third polarization of AI-' 
unphysical because of the exact gauge invariance. 
We could do something even more crazy with this Lagrangian: integrate out 7f. By setting 
7f equal to its equations of motion and substituting back into the Lagrangian, it becomes 
(8.108) 
This Lagrangian is also manifestly gauge invariant, but it is very strange. In reasonable 
field theories, the effects of a field are local, meaning that they decrease with distance. For 
example, a massive scalar field generates a Yukawa potential V(r) = 4;r e- mr so that its 
effects are confined to within the correlation length ~ rv ~. In contrast, at distances r » ~, 
the ~ rv r 2m 2 term in Eq. (8.108) becomes increasingly important. Thus Eq. (8.108) 
appears to describe a non-local theory. 
In quantum field theory, non-local theories have S-matrices that can have poles not asso-
ciated with particles in the Hilbert space. If there are poles without particles, the theory is 
not unitary (as we will show explicitly in Section 24.3). So non-locality and unitarity are 
intimately tied together. In this case, the Lagrangian looks like a Lagrangian for a massless 
spin-l field with two degrees of freedom. However, the missing pmticle, which would cor-
respond to the extra pole in the S-matrix, is precisely the longitudinal mode of AI-" which 
We can call either 7f or the third polarization of a massive spin-l particle. 
In practice, local symmetries make it much easier to do computations. You might won-
der why we even bother introducing this field AI-" which has this huge redundancy to it. 
Instead, why not just quantize the electric and magnetic fields, that is FI-'v itself? Well, you 
131 

132 
Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
could do that, but it turns out to be more complicated than using AIL' To see why, first note 
that F p,v as a field does not propagate with the Lagrangian £ = -
~ F;,v' All the dynamics 
will be moved to the interactions. Moreover, if we include interactions, either with a simple 
current Ap,Jp, or with a scalar field ¢* Ap,op,¢ or with a fermion 7f,p,Ap,'lj;, we see that they 
naturally involve AIL' If we want to write these in terms of Fp,v we have to solve for Ap, 
in terms of Fp,v and we will get some non-local thing such as Ap, = 6ovFp,v. Then We 
would have to spend all our time showing that the theory is actually local and causal. It 
turns out to be much easier to deal with a little redundancy so that we do not have to check 
locality all the time. 
Another reason is that all of the physics of the electromagnetic field is, in fact, not 
entirely contained in Fp,v. There are global topological properties of Ap, that are not 
contained in Fp,v but have physical consequences. An example is the Aharonov-Bohm 
effect, which you might remember from quantum mechanics. Other examples that come 
up in field theory are instantons and sphalerons, which are relevant for the U(l) problem 
and baryogenesis respectively, to be discussed in Section 30.5. There are more general 
gauge-invariant objects than Fp,v that can encode these effects. In particular, Wilson loops 
(see Section 25.2) are gauge invariant, but they are non-local. An approach to reformulat-
ing gauge theories entirely in terms of Wilson lines achieved some limited success in the 
1980s, but remains a longshot approach to reformulating quantum field theory completely. 
In summary, although gauge invariance is merely a redundancy of description, it makes 
it a lot easier to study field theory. The physical content is what we saw in the previous 
section with the Lorentz transformation properties of spin-1 fields: massless spin-l fields 
have two polarizations. If there were a way to compute S-matrix elements without a local 
Lagrangian (and to some extent there is, for example, using recursion relations, as we will 
see in Chapter 27), we might be able to do without this redundancy altogether. 
By the way, the word gauge means size; the original symmetry of this type was con-
ceived by Hermann Weyl as an invariance under scale transformations, now known as 
Weyl or scale invariance. The Lagrangian £ = -~ Fp,v + IDp,¢12 is classically scale invari-
ant. However, at the quantum level, scale invariance is broken (see Chapters 16 and 23). 
Effectively, the coupling constant becomes dependent on the characteristic energy of the 
process. A classical symmetry broken by quantum effects is said to be anomalous. The 
gauge symmetry associated with the photon, or other gauge fields, cannot be anomalous or 
else the Ward identity would be violated and the theory would be non-unitary. Anomalies 
are the subject of Chapter 30. 
8.7 Higher-spin fields 
This section, which can be skipped without losing continuity with the rest of the book, gen-
eralizes the discussion of spin 1 to particles of higher integer spin. In particular, we will 
construct the Lagrangian for spin 2 from the bottom up. A spin-2 particle has five polariza-
tions if it is massive or two polarizations if it is massless. The smallest tensor in which five 
polarizations would fit is a 2-index tensor hp,v. To determine the Lagrangian, rather than

6(n51 sweckelberg for the Abelian case [Slueckelberg, 1935], Sidney Coleman et al. [Cole-
man el al.. 1969' Callan el {Il., 1969J ['or the non-Abelian case, and Arkani-Hamed et 
of. [Arkaru-Hamed et al. 2003] for gravity. The bottom-up construction of the Lagrangian 
for general relativity was discussed by Feynman et al. [Feynman et at., 1996]. 
8.7.1 Longitudinal fields and spin 1 
-
Before turning to spin 2, let us re-analyze spin I in a way that makes it easier to see the 
ghosts. Any vector field can be written as 
(S.109) 
with 
(S.110) 
To see this, observe that this decomposition is invariant under shifts A~ ---> A~ + 0l-'a and 
7f -> 7f - a. Thus, there are an infinite number of ways to split a generic AI-' up this way. 
But from the point of view of A~, this is just a gauge transformation, and we already know 
that we can pick a so that the field is in Lorenz gauge where ol-'Ar = O. 
The beauty of this decomposition is that it lets us see whether the non-transverse polar-
izations are physical simply by looking at the Lagrangian. Start with the most general 
Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian for a vector field AI-': 
(S.111) 
Performing our substitution and using Eq. (8.110) gives 
(S.112) 
We will now show that for a + b =/=- 0, there are ghosts and the theory cannot be unitary. 
An easy way to see this is from 7r'S propagator. In momentum space it is 
II _

2(a + b)k4 - 2m2k 2 -

k 2 
(a + b)k2 - m 2 
. 
(S.113) 
Thus, 7r really represents two fields, one of which has negative norm for generic a and band 
therefore represents a ghost. If we choose a = -b however, the propagator is just mi k 2 ' 
which can represent unitary propagation. More generally, a kinetic term with more than 
two derivatives alw<;lYs indicates that a theory is not unitary. We will show in Section 24.2 
using the spectral decomposition that, in a unitary theory, the fastest that propagators can 
die off at large p2 is II rv ~. With a 0 2 kinetic term, the propagator would die off as J;,.

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
-
We can only remove the dangerous 4-derivative kinetic terms by choosing a = -b, 
leading to the unique physical Lagrangian for a massive spin-1 field we derived before. 
Taking a = -b = ~ and rescaling m 2 --+ ~m2 we get 
1 
1 
12212122 
1: = 2AJlDAJl - 2AJl8Jl8vAv + 2m AJl = -4FJlv + 2m AJl' 
(8.114) 
In this case, we see that the longitudinal modes get a kinetic term from the mass term, as 
expected. 
In the massless limit, there is no kinetic term at all for the longitudinal mode. If a mode 
has interactions but no kinetic terms, the theory is also sick. One way to see that is to take 
the limit that the kinetic term goes to zero. Suppose we had 
(8.115) 
If we rescale the fields to their canonical normalization, 7r c = jZ 7r, we get 
(8.116) 
So Z --+ 0 indicates infinitely strong interactions. Thus, we have to make sure that 7r never 
appears when we substitute AJl --+ AJl + 8Jl7r, which is just the statement that the theory 
must be gauge invariant. For interactions, this will be true if 
(8.117) 
with 8JlJJl = O. 
We can use the same method to determine the interactions. Start with a real field cfJ. The 
simplest Lorentz-invariant interaction we can write down involving AJl and cfJ is 
(8.l18) 
This is not gauge invariant. Nor is there any way to transform cfJ so that it is gauge invariant. 
For a complex field, the unique real interaction term we can write is 
where the substituted part has been integrated by parts. This is not zero. However, if we 
allow cfJ to transform as 
cfJ --+ cfJ - i7rcfJ, 
(8.120) 
then cfJ's kinetic term (8JlcfJ*) (8JlcfJ) will transform as 
(8JlcfJ*)(8JlcfJ) --+ (8JlcfJ*)(8JlcfJ) - i [(8JlcfJ*) (8Jl7r)cfJ - (8JlcfJ)(8Jl7r)cfJ*]- (7rcfJ*) D (7rcfJ) 
= (8JlcfJ*)(8JlcfJ) - i7r(cfJ*DcfJ - cfJDcfJ*) -
(7rcfJ*) D (7rcfJ) , 
(8.121) 
which exactly cancels the unwanted piece. However, now there are terms quadratic in 7r 
that do not cancel. These can be compensated by adding terms second order in the field, 
(8.122) 

8.7 Higher-spin fields 
---
(8.123) 
This is invariant up to ter~s .of.order 7f3, but it is exactly invariant under AIL ---+ ~IL + 0IL7f 
and rP ~ e-''''-¢. In fact, It IS Just the scalar QED Lagrangian that we have denved from 
the bottom up. 
8.7.2 Spin 2 
-
For spin-l fields, the procedure in the previous section is a bit tedious, since we already 
know about gauge invariance. The power of this technique becomes clear when we gener-
alize to spin 2. Let us start with a symmetric tensor hILv (we can force it to be symmetric 
by introducing only 10 independent elements in its Lagrangian). Then we can replace 
hILv = h~v + 0IL7fV + Ov7fIL 
(8.124) 
with oILhrv = O. A massive spin-2 field should have five polarizations, two in the trans-
verse components and three in the longitudinal components, 7f v. To make sure that 7f v has 
three physical components, we can further transform by 
(8.125) 
with OIL7fr = O. 
The most general kinetic terms of dimension 4 we can write down are 
£ = ahILvDhILv + bhILvoILoahva + chDh + dhoILovhILv + m2(xh~v + yh2), (8.126) 
where h = haa is the trace of the tensor. Let us start by looking at the mass term. After 
inserting the replacements in Eqs. (8.124) and (8.125), we find 
m2(xh~v + yh2) = 4m2(x + y)7fLD27fL + ... , 
(8.127) 
which says that a component of the field has a dangerous 4-derivative kinetic term. We can 
eliminate the 4-derivative kinetic term uniquely by taking x = -yo A similar analysis for 
the rest of the Lagrangian leads to 
1 
1

2 
2 
2 
£ = 2hILvDhILv - hlLvoILOahva + hoILovhILv - 2hDh + 2m (hILv - h). 
(8.128) 
This is the unique Lagrangian for a massive spin-2 field. It was first derived by Markus 
Fierz and Wolfgang Pauli in 1939 [Fierz and Pauli, 1939]. 
In the massless limit,

£kill = 4hILvDhILv - 2hILvOILOahva + 2hoILovhILv - 4hDh. 
(8.129) 
This happens to be the leading terms in the expansion of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian 
(see Eq. (8.146) below). 
For a massless spin-2 field, as with a massless spin-l field, the 7f IL should never appear 
in the interactions or the theory will be sick. A generic interaction would be 
(8.130)

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
----------------------------------------------------------------~ 
Then, having 7r v decouple when hl-'v ---+ hl-'v + 01-'7r v + Ov7r I-' forces 0l-'TI-'v = O. Thus, a 
massless spin-2 field must couple to a conserved tensor current. The simplest interaction 
would be 
(8. 131) 
Under 
(8.132) 
this gives 
(8.133) 
which does not vanish. 
The way out is, as in the spin-1 case, that we are allowed to perform replacements on 
¢ at the same time. However, with only this one interaction, any change in ¢ ---+ ¢'[¢, n] 
would automatically have a term with a 7r in it. We can make progress, however, if We 
modify our interaction Lagrangian to 
(8.134) 
and allow for ¢ to transform as 
(8.135) 
That works to cancel the term in Eq. (8.133). The Lagrangian /22 is now invariant up to 
terms with three or more fields: 
(8.136) 
Let us focus on the term linear in 7r, since small 7r represents an infinitesimal trans-

where the . .. contain terms with four or more fields. Integrating by parts, all the terms 
with one factor of 7r cancel. This process can continue as a perturbation expansion in the 
number of fields for terms with one factor of 7r. 
Continuing in this way, we are led to transformations

and 
(8.141) 
with a Lagrangian 
(8.142) 
his Lagrangian will be independent of 1r to linear order in 1r. 
r To make something invariant to all orders in 1r, the complete transformation can be 
written as 
(8.143) 
(8.144) 
where cj;(xa + 1ra) and ha(3(xi + 1ri) are to be understood as Taylor expansions in 1r. Here, 
is the Minkowski metric, which we usually call gf-Lv. A reader familiar with general 
~~~tivity will recognize this as a general coordinate transformation, and the Lagrangian as 
.L= j -det('r/f-Lv+ ~Plhf-Lv)cj;, 
(8.145) 
where MPI = GN
1/ 2 ~ 1019 GeV is the Planck scale, which has been introduced to make 
hf-Lv have mass dimension 1. 
In the same way, the kinetic terms for hf-Lv become 
(8.146) 
where R is the Ricci scalar. We have rescaled hf-Lv by a factor of J
P1 by dimensional 
analysis to give hf-Lv canonical dimension, since R has dimension 2 (every term in R has 
two derivatives). Thus, the Lagrangian for general relativity is given uniquely as the only 
Lagrangian that can couple a massless spin-2 particle to matter. 
This is obviously a very inefficient way to deduce the Lagrangian for a massless spin-2 
field. It is much nicer to use symmetry arguments, general coordinate invariance, the equiv-
alence principle, etc. The one thing those arguments do not tell you is why that theory is 
unique. For example, in general relativity, at some point you have to assume the connection 
is torsion free and compatible with the metric. What happened to the torsion tensor? If all 
you know about is general coordinate invariance, you have not yet constructed a physical 
theory. Constructing it this way you see that you generate the curvature tensor, not the 
torsion tensor. More precisely, it might be the torsion tensor for a different geometric con-
struction, but the expansion in terms of hf-Lv will be identical. The simple fact that there is a 
unique theory of a massless spin-2 particle coupled to matter is an important consequence 
of this approach. 
Of course, there are huge advantages to general relativity. In particular, this approach 
is based on Lorentz invariance and is entirely perturbative. In contrast, general relativity 
is background independent and non-perturbative. The Schwarzschild solution, from this 
language, is a coherent background of gravitons. That is not a productive language for

Spin 1 and gauge invariance 
doing calculations in general, although it is useful for certain calculations. For example, 
the perihelion shift of Mercury can be computed perturbatively this way (Problem 3.7). 
8.7.3 Spin greater than 2 
One can continue this procedure for integer spin greater than 2. There exist spin-3 particles 
in nature, for example the W3 with mass of 1670 MeV, as well as spin 4, spin 5, etc. These 
particles are all massive. One can construct free Lagrangians for them using the same trick. 
An interesting and profound result is that it is impossible to have an interacting theory of 
massless particles with spin greater than 2. The required gauge invariance would be so 
restrictive that nothing could satisfy it. We will prove this in the next chapter. Constructing 
the kinetic term for a spin-3 particle is done in Problem 8.8.

Scalar quantum electrodynamics 
Now that we have Feynman rules and we know how to quantize the photon, we are very 
close to QED. All we need is the electron, which is a spinor. Before we get into spinors, 
however, it is useful to explore a theory that is an approximation to QED in which the spin 
of the electron can be neglected. This is called scalar QED. The Lagrangian is 
with 
DI"¢ = 0l"¢ + ieAI"¢' 
DI"¢* = 0l"¢* - ieAI"¢*' 
(9.1) 
(9.2) 
(9.3) 
Although there actually do exist charged scalar fields in nature which this Lagrangian 
describes, for example the charged pions, that is not the reason we are introducing scalar 
QED before spin or QED. Spinors are somewhat complicated, so starting with this simpli-
fied Lagrangian will let us understand some elements of QED without having to deal with 
spinor algebra. 
9.1 Quantizing complex scalar fields 
We saw that for a scalar field to couple to AI" it has to be complex. This is because the 
charge is associated with a continuous global symmetry under which 
(9.4) 
Such phase rotations only make sense for complex fields. The first thing to notice is that 
the classical equations of motion for ¢ and ¢* arel 
(0 + m2) ¢ = i( -eAI") op,¢ + i0l" ( -eAp,¢) + (-eAI")2 ¢, 
(9.5) 
(0 + m 2) ¢* = i(eAp,) op,¢* + i0l"(eAp,¢*) + (eAI")2¢*. 
(9.6) 
So we see that ¢ and ¢* couple to the electromagnetic field with opposite charge, but have 
the same mass. Of course, something having an equation does not mean we can produce 
1 We are treating ¢ and ¢* as separate real degrees of freedom. If you find this confusing you can always write 
¢ = ¢1 + i¢2 and study the physics of the two independent fields ¢1 and ¢2. but the ¢ and ¢* notation is 
much more efficient.

Since a complex scalar field must be different from its conjugate by definition, we have 
to allow for a more general form. We can do this by introducing two sets of creation and 
annihilation operators and writing 
A.( ) - J d

(9.9) 
Thus, we can conclude that bp annihilates particles of opposite charge and the same mass 
to what ap annihilates. That is, bp annihilates the antiparticles. Note that in both cases 
wp = JiP + m 2 > O. 
All we used was the fact that the field was complex. Clearly at i=- bt as these operators 
create particles of opposite charge. So a global symmetry under phase rotations implies 
charge, which implies complex fields, which implies antiparticles. That is, 
Matter coupled to massless spin-l particles automatically implies the existence of 
antiparticles, which are particles of identical mass and opposite charge. 
This profound conclusion is an inevitable consequence of relativity and quantum 
mechanics. 
To recap, we saw that to have a consistent theory with a massless spin-l particle 
we needed gauge invariance. This required a conserved current, which in turn required 
that charge be conserved. To couple the photon to matter, we needed more than one 
degree of freedom so we were led to ¢ and ¢*. Upon quantization, complex scalar fields 
imply antiparticles. Thus, there are many profound consequences of consistent theories of 
massless spin-l particles. 
9.1.1 Historical note: holes 
HistOrically, it was the Dirac equation that led to antiparticles. In fact, in 1931 Dirac pre-
dicted there should be a particle exactly like the electron except with opposite charge. In 
1932 the positron was discovered by Anderson, beautifully confirming Dirac's prediction 
and inspiring generations of physicists.

Actually, Dirac had an interpretation of antiparticles that sounds funny in retrospect, but 
was much more logical to him for historical reasons. Suppose we had written 
J..( ) - J d

(t ipx + t -iPX) 
'f/ x -
(27r)3 -j2W;, ape 
cpe 
, 
(9.10) 
where both at and 4 are creation operators. Then 4 seems to be creating states of negative 
frequency, or equivalently negative energy. This made sense to Dirac at the time, since there 
are classical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation, E2 - p2 = m 2, with negative energy, 
so something should create these solutions. Dirac interpreted these negative energy creation 
operators as removing something of positive energy, and creating an energy hole. But an 
energy hole in what? His answer was that the universe is a sea full of positive energy states. 
Then 4 creates a hole in this sea, which moves around like an independent excitation. 
Then why does the sea stay full, and not collapse to the lower-energy configuration? 
Dirac's explanation for this was to invoke the Fermi exclusion principle. The sea is like the 
orbitals of an atom. When an atom loses an electron it becomes ionized, but it looks like it 
gained a positive charge. So positive charges can be interpreted as the absence of negative 
charges, as long as all the orbitals are filled. Dirac argued that the universe might be almost 
full of particles, so that the negative energy states are the absences of those particles [Dirac, 
1930]. 
It is not hard to see that this is total nonsense. For example, it should work only for 
fermions, not our scalar field, which is a boson. As we have seen, it is much easier to write 
the creation operator 4 as an annihilation operator to begin with, 4 = bp , which cleans 
everything up immediately. Then the negative energy solutions correspond to the absence 
of antiparticles, which does not require a sea. 
9.2 Feynman rules for scalar QED 
Expanding out the scalar QED Lagrangian we find 
1: = -~F;I/ - ¢*(O + m 2 )¢ - ieAIi [¢* (Oli¢) - (Oli¢*)¢] + e2 A!I¢1 2 .

(9.12) 
This propagator is the Fourier transform of (Ol¢* (x )¢(O) 10) in the free theory. It propagates 
both ¢ and ¢*, that is both particles and antiparticles at the same time - they cannot be 
disentangled. 
The photon propagator was calculated in Section 8.5:

9.2 Feynman rules for scalar QED

some of the interactions that connect AIL to ¢ and ¢* have derivatives in them, which 
will give momentum factors in the Feynman rules. To see which momentum factors we 
t look back at the quantized fields:

(a~eiPX + bpe- iPX ) . 
(9.15) 
A cP in the interaction implies the creation of an antiparticle or the annihilation of a particle 
at position x. A ¢* implies the creation of a particle or the annihilation of an antiparticle. 
When a derivative acts on these fields, we will pull down a factor of ±ipiL which enters the 
vertex Feynman rule. 
Since the interaction has the form 
(9.16) 
it always has one ¢ and one ¢*. Each piL comes with an i, and there is another i from the 
expansion of exp(iLint), so we always get an overall (-ie) i 2 = ie multiplying whichever 
±pl' comes from the derivative. There are four possibilities, each one getting a contribu-
tion from AiL¢*(OiL¢) and -AiL¢(OiL¢*)' Calling what ap annihilates an e- and what bp 
annihilates an e+ the possibilities are: 
• Annihilate e- and create e- - particle scattering

- ¢( 0iL¢*) gives a - (+p!) because an e- is being created by ¢*. We will come back to 
the anows in a moment. 
• Annihilate e+ and create e+ - antiparticle scattering 
(9.18) 
Here, ¢*(OiL¢) creates the e+ giving P~ and -(OiL¢*)¢ annihilates an e+ giving 
-( -p~). The next two you can do yourself.

• Create e- and create e+ - pair creation 
(9.20) 
First of all, we see that there are only four types of vertices. It is impossible for a vertex to 
create two particles of the same charge. That is, the Feynman rules guarantee that charge 
is conserved. 
Now let us explain the arrows. In the above vertices, the arrows outside the scalar lines 
are momentum-flow arrows, indicating the direction that momentum is flowing. We conven-
tionally draw momentum flowing from left to right. The arrows superimposed on the lines 
in the diagram are particle-flow arrows. These arrows point in the direction of momentum 
for particles (e-) but opposite to the direction of momentum for antiparticles (e+). If you 
look at all the vertices, you will see that if the particle-flow arrow points to the right, the 
vertex gives -iep 1"' if the particle-flow arrow points to the left, the vertex gives +iep w So 
the particle-flow arrows make the scalar QED Feynman rule easy to remember: 
A scalar QED vertex gives -ie times the sum of the momentum of the particles whose 
particle-flow arrows point to the right minus the momentum of the particles whose 
arrows point to the left. 
The four cases in Eqs. (9.17) to (9.20) are reproduced by this single rule. 
Particle-flow arrows should always make a connected path through the Feynman dia-
gram. For internal lines and loops, whether your lines point left or right is arbitrary; as 
long as the direction of the arrows is consistent with particle flow the answer will be the 
same. If your diagram represents a physical process, external line particle-flow arrows 
should always point right for particles and to the left for antiparticles. 
For loops it is impossible to always have the momentum going to the right. It is con-
ventional in loops to have the momentum flow in the same direction as the charge-flow 
arrows. For uncharged particles, such as photons or real scalars, you can pick any direc-
tions for the loop momenta you want, as long as momentum is conserved at each vertex.

Finally, we cannot forget that there is another 4-point vertex in scalar QED: 
(9.22) 
This vertex comes from 1 D" ¢ 12, so it is forced by gauge invariance. Its Feynman rule is 
(9.23) 
This is sometimes called a seagull vertex, perhaps due to its vague resemblence to the 
head-on view of a bird. The 2 comes from the symmetry factor for the two A fields. There 
would not have been a 2 if we had written ~ e2 A ~ 1 ¢ 12, but this is not what the Lagrangian 
gives us. The i comes from the expansion of exp( i£int) which we always have for Feynman 
rules. 
9.2.1 External states 
Now we know the vertex factors and propagators for the photon and the complex scalar 
field. The only thing left in the Feynman rules is how to handle external states. For a scalar 
field, this is easy - we just get a factor 1. That is because a complex scalar field is just two 
real scalar fields, so we just take the real scalar field result. The only thing left is external 
photons. 
For external photons, recall that the photon field is 
(9.24) 
As far as free states are concerned, which is all we need for S-matrix elements, the pho-
ton is just a bunch of scalar fields integrated against some polarization vectors E~ (k). 
Recall that external states with photons have momenta and polarizations, Ik, E), so that 
(OIA,,(x)lk, Ei) = 
E~(k)e-ikx. This leads to LSZ being modified only by adding a fac-
tor of the photon polarization for each external state: E" if it is incoming and E~ if it is 
Outgoing.

9.3 Scattering in scalar QED 
As a first application, let us calculate the cross section for M0ller scattering, e-e-
-> 
e- e-, in scalar QED. There are two diagrams. The t-channel diagram (recall the

So this simplifies to

and the ~ dependence has vanished. We expected this to happen, by gauge invariance, and 
now we have seen that it does indeed happen.

9.4 Ward identity and gauge invariance 
We saw in the previous example that the matrix elements for a particular amplitude in 
scalar QED were independent of the gauge parameter ~. The photon propagator is 
(9.33) 
A general matrix element involving an internal photon will be Ml"vIIl"v for some Ml"v' So 
gauge invariance, which in this context means ~ independence, requires Ml"vPI"Pv = O. 
Gauge invariance in this sense is closely related to the Ward identity, which required 
Pl"lvIl" = 0 if the matrix element involving an on-shell photon is EI"MW Both gauge 
invariance and the Ward identity hold for any amplitude in scalar QED. However, it is 
somewhat tedious to prove this in perturbation theory. In this section, we will give a couple 
of examples illustrating what goes into the proof, with the complete non-perturbative proof 
postponed until Section 14.8 after path integrals are introduced. 
As an non-trivial example where the Ward identity can be checked, consider the process 
e+ e- -+ ,T A diagram contributing to this is

Using only that the electron is on shell (not assuming P§ = p~ = P3 . t3 = P4 . t4), this 
simplifies slightly to 
(9.35) 
The crossed diagram gives the same thing with 1 +-+ 2 (or equivalently 3 +-+ 4) 
(9.36) 
To check whether the Ward identity is satisfied with just these two diagrams, we replace 
E3 v with p~ giving

and the Ward identity is satisfied. 
(9.38) 
(9.39) 
The above derivation did not require us to use that the photons are on-shell or massless. 
That is, we did not apply any of p~ = p~ = E3 . P3 = t4 . P4 = O. Thus, the Ward identity 
would be satisfied even if the external photon states were not physical; for example, if they 
were in a loop. In fact, that is exactly what we need for gauge invariance, so the same 
calculation can be used to prove ~ independence. 
To prove gauge invariance, we need to consider internal photon propagators, for example 
in a diagram such as

purpose, the entire right side of the diagram (or the left side) can be replaced by a generic

which is very closely related to the t-channel diagram above, Eq. (9.34). The integral can 
be written in the form 
(9.42) 
where we have inserted an extra integral over momentum and an extra 6-function to keep 
the amplitude symmetric in q and k. Comparing with Eq. (9.33), the polarization vectors 
E~ and E4 have been replaced by contractions with the photon propagators and P3 ---'; q and 
P4 ---'; k. Replacing II"o:( q) by ~q,"qa we see that the result does not vanish, implying that 
this diagram alone is not gauge invariant. 
To see gauge invariance, we need to include all the diagrams that contribute at the same 
order. This includes the u-channel diagrams and the one involving the 4-point vertex:

Scalar quantum electrodynamics 
Now if we replace IIJ.'''' (q) ----t ~ qJ.' q", we find 
which exactly vanishes. Thus, gauge invariance holds in this case. The case of ~ photon 
attaching to a closed scalar loop is similar and you can explore it in Problem 9.2. 
A general diagrammatic proof involves arguments like this, generalized to an arbitrary 
number of photons and possible loops. The only challenging part is keeping track of the 
combinatorics associated with the different diagrams. Some examples can be found in [Zee, 
2003] and in [Peskin and Schroeder, 1995]. The complete diagrammatic proof is actually 
easier in real QED (with scalars) than in scalar QED, since there is no 4-point vertex in 
QED. As mentioned above, we will give a complete non-perturbative proof of both gauge 
invariance and the Ward identity in Section 14.8. 
9.5 Lorentz invariance and charge conservation 
There is a beautiful and direct connection between Lorentz invariance and charge con-
servation that bypasses gauge invariance completely. What we will now show is that a 
theory with a massless spin-l particle automatically has an associated conserved charge. 
This profound result, due to Steven Weinberg, does not require a Lagrangian description: 
it only uses little-group invariance and the fact that for a massless field one can take the 
soft limit [Weinberg, 1964]. 
Imagine we have some diagram with lots of external legs and loops and things. Say 
the matrix element for this process is Mo. Now tack on an outgoing photon of momen-
tum qJ.' and polatization EJ.' onto an external leg. For simplicity, we take EJ.' real to avoid 
writing E~ everywhere. Let us first tack the photon onto leg i , which we take to be an 
incoming e- :

(9.47) 
We can simplify this using P; = m 2 and q2 = 0 in the denominator, since the electron 
and photon are on-shell, and qlLclL = 0 in the numerator, since the polarizations of physical 
photons are transverse to their own momenta. Then we get 
Pi' C 
Mi(Pi, q) = -e-MO(pi - q) .

Pi .q 
Now take the soft limit. By soft we mean that Iq· Pil « Ipj . Pkl for all the external 
momenta Pi, not just the one we modified. Then Mo (pi - q) RO Mo (Pi), where RO indi-
cates the soft limit. Note that photons attached to loop momenta in the blob in Mo are 
subdominant to photons attached to external legs, since the loop momenta are off-shell and 
hence the associated propagators are not singular as q ----+ O. That is, photons coming off 
loops cannot give Pi\ factors. Thus, in the soft limit, the dominant effect comes only from 
diagrams where photons are attached to external legs. We must sum over all such diagrams. 
If the leg is an incoming e+, we would get 
Pi ·c 
Mi (pi, q) RO e-Mo (Pi) ,

(9.49) 
where the sign flip comes from the charge of the e+. If the leg is an outgoing electron, it is

Scalar quantum electrodynamics 
Here comes the punchline. Under a Lorentz transformation, M(Pi, f) -t M(p;, 1"), 
where p; and 1" are the momenta and polarization in the new frame. Since M must be 
Lorentz invariant, the transformed M must be the same. However, polarization vectors do 
not transform exactly like 4-vectors. As we showed explicitly in Section 82.3, there are 
certain Lorentz transformations for which ql-' is invariant and 
(9.54) 
These transformations are members of the little group, so the basis of polarization vectors 
does not change. Since there is no polmization proportional to ql-" there does not exist a 
physical polarization f~ in the new frame that is equal to the transformed fl-'. Therefore, 
M has to change, violating Lorentz invariance. The only way out is if the ql-' term does not 
contribute. In terms of M, the little-group transformation effects 
M --; M + eMo [ 2: Qi - 2: Qil 
incoming 
outgoing 
(9.55) 
and therefore the only way for M to be Lorentz invariant is 
(9.56) 
incoming 
outgoing 
which says that charge is conserved. This is a sum over all of the particles in the original 
Mo diagram, without the soft photon. Since this process was arbitrary, we conclude that 
charge must always be conserved. 
Although we used the form of the interaction in scalar QED to derive the above result, it 
turns out this result is completely general. For example, suppose the photon had an arbitrm·y 
interaction with ¢. Then the Feynman rule for the vertex could have arbitrary dependence 
on momenta: 
= -ier I-' (p, q) . 
(9.57) 
The vertex must have a fJ. index to contract with the polarization, by Lorentz invm·iance. 
Furthermore, also by Lorentz invariance, since the only 4-vectors available are pI-' and ql-', 
we must be able to write rJ-L = 2pl-' F(p2, q2, P . q) + ql-'G (p2, q2, P . q). Functions such as 
F and G are sometimes called form factors. In scalar QED, F = G = 1. Since ql-'fl-' = 0 
we can discard G. Moreover, since p2 = m 2 and q2 = 0, the remaining form factor can 
only be a function of ~ by dimensional analysis, so we write rJ-L = 2pl-' F(~). Now we 
put this general form into the above argument, so that

Thus, we get the same result as before, and moreover produce a general definition of the 
charge Q i = - Fi (0). (This definition will re-emerge in the context of renormalization, 
in Section 19.3.) 
Thus, the connection between a massless spin-1 particle and conservation of charge 
is completely general. In fact, the same result holds for charged particles of any spin. 
The p:~ form of the interaction between light and matter in the soft limit is universal and 
spin fndependent. (It is called an eikonal interaction. The soft limit of gauge theories is 
discussed in more detail in Section 36.3.) The conclusion is: 
Massless spin-1 particles imply conservation of charge. 
Note that masslessness of the photon was important in two places: that there are only two 
physical polarizations, and that we can take the soft limit with the photon on-shell. 
"What's the big deal?" you say, "we knew that already." But in the derivation from the 
previous chapter, we had to use gauge invariance, gauge-fix, isolate the conserved current, 
etc. Those steps were all artifacts of trying to write down a nice simple Lagrangian. The 
result we just derived does not require Lagrangians or gauge invariance at all. It just uses 
that a massless particle of spin-1 has two polarizations and the soft limit. Little-group 
scaling was important, but only to the extent that the final answer had to be a Lorentz-
invariant function of the polarizations and momenta 4-vectors. The final conclusion, that 
charge is conserved, does not care that we embedded the two polarizations in a 4-vector 
EW It would be true even if we only used on-shell helicity amplitudes (an alternative proof 
without polarization vectors is given in Chapter 27). 
To repeat, this is a non-perturbative statement about the physical universe, not a state-
ment about our way of doing computations, like gauge invariance and the Ward identities 
are. Proofs like this are rare and very powerful. In Problem 9.3 you can show in a similar 
way that, when multiple massless spin-1 particles are involved, the soft limit forces them 
to transform in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. We now turn to the implications 
of the soft limit for massless particles of integer spin greater than 1. 
9.5.1 Lorentz invariance for spin 2 and higher 
A massless spin-2 field has two polarizations E~v' which rotate into each other under 
Lorentz transformations, and also into qP,qv' There are little-group transformations that 
send 
(9.60) 
153 

154 
Scalar quantum electrodynamics 
--
where these Ap vectors have to do with the explicit way the Lorentz group acts, which 
we do not care about so much. Thus, any theory involving a massless spin-2 field should 
satisfy a Ward identity: if we replace even one index of the polarization tensor by qp the 
matrix elements must vanish. The spin-2 polarizations can be projected out of Eptl as the 
transverse-traceless modes: qpEptl = Epp = O. 
What do the interactions look like? As in the scalar case, they do not actually matter, 
and we can write a general interaction as 
(9.61) 
where F(x) is some function, different in general from the spin-l form fa~tor F(x). The 
/-l and v indices on r pv will contract with the indices of the spin-2 polarization vector Epv. 
Taking the soft limit and adding up diagrams for incoming and outgoing spin-2 particles, 
we find 
(9.62) 
which is similar to what we had for spin 1, but with an extra factor of P~ in each sum. 
By Lorentz invariance, little-group transformations such as those in Eg. (9.60) imply 
that this should vanish if Eptl = qpAv for any Av. So, writing "-i == Fi(O), which is just a 
number for each particle, we find 
L "-iP'i] =0, 
outgoing 
(9.63) 
which implies 
(9.64) 
incommg 
outgoing 
In other words, the sum of "-iP'i is conserved. But we already know, by momentum conser-
vation, that the sum of pr is conserved. So, for example, we can solve for pi in terms of the 
others. If we add another constraint on the pr then there would be a different solution for 
pi, which is impossible unless all the pr are zero. The only way we can have non-trivial 
scattering is for all the charges to be the same: 
"-i = "-
for all i. 
(9.65) 
But that is exactly what gravity does! All particles gravitate with the same strength, "-i == 
Ml =,;0;;. In other words, gravity is universal. So, 
PI 
Massless spin-2 particles imply gravity is universal.

that is, the sum of the squares of the energies times some charges are conserved. That 
is way too constraining. The only way out is if all the charges are 0, which is a boring, 
non-interacting theory of free massless spin-3 field. So, 
There are no interacting theories of massless particles of spin greater than 2. 
And in fact, no massless particles with spin> 2 have ever been seen. (Massive particles of 
spin> 2 are plentiful [Particle Data Group (Beringer et al.), 2012].)

9.3 In this problem you will prove the uniqueness of non-Abelian gauge theories by Con_ 
sidering the soft limit when there are multiple scalar fields ¢i. Suppose these fields 
have a mass matrix ]vi (i.e. the mass term in the Lagrangian is L = Mij ¢i ¢j) and 
there are N massless spin-l particles A~, a = 1 ... N we will call gluons. Then the 
generic interaction between A~, ¢i and ¢j can be written as r~r(p, q) as in Eq. (9.57).

have a pole, for example as (qa + qb)2 ---7 O. 
(e) Such a pole indicates a massless particle being exchanged, naturally identified 
as a gluon. In this case, the r~JJlV interaction in part (d) can be resolved into a

scattering amplitude be Lorentz invariant in the soft limit. This implies that the 
gluons transform in the adjoint representation of a Lie group, as will be discussed 
in Chapter 25. 
9.4 The soft limit also implies that massless spin-2 particles (gravitons) must have self-
interactions. 
(a) To warm up, consider the soft limit of massless spin-! particles coupled to 
scalars (as in scalar QED). Just assuming generic interactions (not the scalar 
QED Lagrangian), show that there must be an AA¢* ¢ interaction for Compton

(b) Now consider Compton scattering of gravitons h off scalars. Show that there must 
be an hh¢¢ interaction. Then show that unlike the massless spin-! case the new 
interaction must have a pole at (ql + q2)2 = O. This pole should be resolved into 
a graviton exchange graph. Derive a relationship between the form of the graviton 
self-coupling and the h¢¢ coupling. 

The structure of the periodic table is due largely to the electron having spin ~. In non-
relativistic quantum mechanics you learned that the spin + ~ and spin -
~ states of the 
electron projected along a particular direction are efficiently described by a complex 
doublet: 
I~) = I J ). 
(10.1) 
You probably also learned that the dynamics of this doublet, in the non-relativistic limit, is 
governed by the Schrodinger-Pauli equation: 
where A and Ao are the vector and scalar potentials, jj 
V x A and fJB 
-2 
e 
is

the Bohr magneton, which characterizes the strength of the electron's magnetic dipole 
moment. The last term in this equation is responsible for the Stern-Gerlach effect. 
You may also have learned of a shorthand notation for this involving the Pauli matrices: 
(10.3) 
which let us write the Schrodinger-Pauli equation more concisely: 
(1004) 
where ~(x) = (x I~) as usual. This equation is written with the Pauli matrices combined 
into a vector a = (aI, a2, a3) so that rotationally invariant quantities such as (a . jj)~ are 
easy to write. That (a . jj)~ is rotationally invariant is non-trivial, and only works because

which are the same algebraic relations satisfied by infinitesimal rotations (we will review 
this shortly). Keep in mind that ai do not change under rotations - they are always given 
by Eq. (10.3) in any frame. ~ is changing and Bi is changing, and these changes cancel in 
(a . jj)~. 
We could also have written down a rotationally invariant equation of motion for~:

Spinors 
Since Oi transforms as a 3-vector and so does (Ji'lj;, this equation is rotationally invariant. It 
turns out it is Lorentz invariant too. In fact, this is just the Dirac equation! If we write 
(10.7) 
then Eq. (10.6) becomes 
(10.8) 
which is nice and simple looking. (Actually, this is the Dirac equation for a Weyl spinor, 
which is not exactly the same as the equation commonly called the Dirac equation.) 
Unfortunately, it does not follow that this equation is Lorentz invariant just because We 
have written it as (JI"0w For example, 
(10.9) 
is not Lorentz invariant. To understand these enigmatic transformation properties, we have 
to know how to relate the Lorentz group to the Pauli matrices. It turns out that the Pauli 
matrices naturally come out of the mathematical analysis of the representations of the 
Lorentz group. By studying these representations, we will find spin-~ particles, which 
transform in spinor representations. The Dirac equation and its non-relativistic limit, the 
Schrodinger-Pauli equation, will immediately follow. 
10.1 Representations of the Lorentz group 
In Chapter 8, we identified particles with unitary representations of the Poincare group. 
Due to Wigner's theorem, these representations are characterized by two quantum num-
bers: mass m and spin j. Recall where these quantum numbers come from. Mass is Lorentz 
invariant, so it is an obvious quantum number. Momentum is also conserved, but it is 
Lorentz covariant; that is, momentum is not a good quantum number for cliaracterizing 
particles since it is frame dependent. If we choose a frame in which the momentum has 
some canonical form, for example pI" = (m, 0, 0, 0) for m > 0, then the particles are 
characterized by the group that holds this momentum fixed, known as the little group. For 
example, the little group for pI" = (m, 0, 0, 0) is the group of 3D rotations, 80(3). The 
little group representations provide the second quantum number, j. The way the states 
transform under the full Poincare group is then induced by the transformations under the 
little group and the way the momentum transforms under boosts. 
There are no finite-dimensional non-trivial unitary representations of the Poincare group, 
but there are infinite-dimensional ones. We have seen how these can be embedded into 
fields, such as VI"(x), ¢(x) or TI"v(x). As we saw for spin 1, a lot of trouble comes from 
having to embed particles of fixed mass and spin into these fields. The problem is that, 
except for ¢( x), these fields describe reducible and non-unitary representations. For exam-
ple, VI" (x) has four degrees of freedom, which describes spin 0 and spin 1. We found 
that we could construct a unitary theory for massive spin 1 by carefully choosing the 
Lagrangian so that the physical theory never excites the spin-O component. For massless 

10.1 Representations of the Lorentz group 
in 1, we could also choose a Lagrangian that only propagated the spin-l component, but 
:lY by introdu~ing gauge invariance. This led directly to charge co~se~vation. 
. 
The next logIcal step to make these embeddings more systematIc IS to determme all 
ossible Lorentz-invariant fields we can write down. This will reveal the existence of the 
~pin-~ states, and help us characterize their embeddings into fields. 
10.1.1 Group theory 
--
A group is a set of elements {gil and a rule gi x gj = gk which tells how each pair of 
elements is multiplied to get a third. The rule defines the group, independent of any partic-
ular way to write the group elements down as matrices. More precisely, the mathematical 
definition requires the rule to be associative (gi x gj) X gk = gi X (gj x gk), there to 
be an identity element for which] x gi = gi X ] = gi, and for the group elements to 
have inverses, gi 1 x gi = ]. A representation is a particular embedding of these gi into 
operators that act on a vector space. For finite-dimensional representations, this means an 
embedding of the gi into matrices. Often we talk about the vectors on which the matrices 
act as being the representation, but technically the matrix embedding is the representation. 
Any group has the trivial representation r : gi ---7 ]. A representation in which each group 
element gets its own matrix is called a faithful representation. 
Recall that the Lorentz group is the set of rotations and boosts that preserve the 
Minkowski metric: AT gA 
g. The A matrices in this equation are in the 4-vector 
representation under which

These matrices give an embedding of elements of the Lorentz group into a set of matri-
ces. That is, they describe one particular representation of the Lorentz group (the 4-vector 
representation). We would now like to find all the representations. 
The Lorentz group itself is a mathematical object independent of any particular rep-
resentation. To extract the group away from its representations, it is easiest to look 
at infinitesimal transformations. In the 4-vector representation, an infinitesimal Lorentz 
transformation can be written in terms of side infinitesimal angles (ji and f3i as 
oXo = f3iXi, 
oXi = f3iXO - Cijk(jjXk,

These matrices are known as the generators of the Lorentz group in the 4-vector basis. 
They generate the group in the sense that any element of the group can be written 
uniquely as 
(10.16) 
up to some discrete transformations. The advantage of writing the group elements this way 
is that it is completely general. In any finite-dimensional representation the group elements 
can be written as an exponential of matrices. 
For any group G, some group elements 9 E G can be written as 9 = exp(icf Ai), where 
cf are numbers and Ai are group generators. The generators are in an algebra, because 
you can add and multiply them, while the group elements are in a group, because you 
can only multiply them. For example, the real numbers form an algebra ,(there is a rule 
for addition and a rule for multiplication) but rotations are a group (there is only one rule, 
multiplication). Lie groups are a class of groups, including the Lorentz group, with an 
infinite number of elements but a finite number of generators. The generators of the Lie 
group form an algebra called its Lie algebra. Lie groups are critical to understanding the 
Standard Model, since QED is described by the unitary group U(l), the weak force by the 
special unitary group 8U(2) and the strong force by the group 8U(3). The Lorentz group is 
sometimes called 0(1,3). This is an orthogonal (preserves a metric) group corresponding 
to a metric with (1,3) signature (i.e. g~v = diag (1, -1, -1, -1 )). 
Lie groups also have the structure of a differentiable manifold. For most applications of 
quantum field theory, the manifold is totally irrelevant, but it is occasionally important. For 
example, topological properties of the 3D rotation group 80(3) will help us understand 
the spin-statistics theorem. We sometimes distinguish the proper orthochronous Lorentz 
group, which is the elements of the Lorentz group continuously connected to the identity, 
from the full Lorentz group, which includes time reversal (T) and parity reversal (P). 
In a Lie algebra the multiplication rule is defined as the Lie bracket. With matrix rep-
resentations, this Lie bracket is just an ordinary commutator. Since any element of a Lie

Wi l l:> 
[Ji, Jj ] = iEijkJk, 
[Ji, K j] = iEijkKk, 
[Ki' K j] = -iEijdk. 
(10.17) 
(10.18) 
(10.19) 
These commutation relations define the Lorentz algebra, so(l, 3). You might recognize 
that [Ji' Jj] = iEijkJk is the algebra for rotations, 80(3), and in fact the Ji generate the 
3D rotation subgroup of the Lorentz group. 
These commutation relations define the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. Although 
these commutation relations were derived using Eq. (10.14) they must hold for any 
representation; for example in the rank-2 tensor representation Ji and Ki can be writ-
ten as l6-dimensional matrices. It is sometimes useful to use a different form for these 
commutation relations. We can index the generators by V/LV instead of Ji and K i : 
(10.20) 
Here each V/LV is itself a 4 x 4 matrix, for example, V 23 = J1 . A Lorentz transformation 
can be written in terms of V/LV as Av = exp(i8/Lv V/LV) for six numbers 8/Lv' These V/LV 
satisfy 
(10.21) 
By definition, the generators in any other representation must satisfy these same relations. 
For example, another representation of the Lorentz group is given by 
(10.22) 
This is an infinite-dimensional representation which acts on functions rather than a 
finite-dimensional vector space. These are the classical generators of angular momentum 
generalized to include time. You can check that L/Lv satisfy the commutation relations of 
the Lorentz algebra. 
By the way, not all the elements of the Lorentz group can be written as exp(icf Ai) 
for some cf. The generators of the Lorentz algebra 80(1,3) only generate the part of the 
Lorentz group connected to the identity, known as the proper orthochronous Lorentz group 
80+(1,3). It is possible for two different groups to have the same algebra. For example, 
the proper orthochronous Lorentz group and the full Lorentz group have the same algebra, 
but the full Lorentz group has in addition time reversal and parity. The group generated by 
0(1,3) and T is called the orthochronous Lorentz group, denoted 0+(1,3). The proper 
Lorentz group is the special orthogonal group 80(1,3), which contains only the elements 
with determinant 1, so it excludes T and P. Sometimes 80(1,3) is taken to include only 
p with 80+(1,3) excluding also T. These notations are more general than we need: in

odd space-time dimensions, parity has determinant 1 and is therefore a special orthogonal 
transformation. Rather than worry about group naming conventions, we will simply talk: 
about the Lorentz group with or without T and P. 
10.1.2 General representations of the Lorentz group 
The irreducible representations of the Lorentz group can be constructed from irreducible 
representations of 8U(2). To see how this works, we start with the rotation generators Ji 
and the boost generators K j . You can think ofthem as the matrices in Eq. (10.14), which 
is a particular representation, but the algebraic properties in Eqs. (10.17) to (10.19) are 
representation independent. 
Now take the linear combinations 
which satisfy 
1 
J~ = -(J. - iK) 
2-22 
2, 
[Jt, Jt] = iEijd:, 
[Ji-, Jj-] = iEijd-';, 
[Jt, Jj-] = O. 
(10.23) 
(10.24) 
(10.25) 
(10.26) 
These commutation relations indicate that the Lie algebra for the Lorentz group has two 
commuting subalgebras. The algebra generated by Ji+ (or Ji-) is the 3D rotation algebra, 
which has multiple names, so(3) = 
sl(2,~) = so(I,I) = su(2), due to multiple Lie 
groups having the same algebra. So we have shown that 
so(I,3) = su(2) EEl su(2). 
(10.27) 
Thus, representations of su(2) EElsu(2) will determine representations of the Lorentz group. 
The decomposition so(l, 3) = su(2) EEl su(2) makes studying the irreducible represen-
tations very easy. We already know from quantum mechanics what the representations 
of su(2) are, since su(2) = 3) is the algebra of Pauli matrices, which generates the 3D 
rotation group 80(3). Each irreducible representation of su(2) is characterized by a half-
integer j. The representation acts on a vector space with 2j + 1 basis elements (see Problem 
10.2). It follows that irreducible representations of the Lorentz group are characterized by 
two half-integers: A and B. The (A, B) representation has (2A + 1) (2B + 1) degrees of 
freedom. 
The regular rotation generators are J = J+ + J-, where we use the vector superscript 
to call attention to the fact that the spins must be added vectorially, as you might remem-
ber from studying Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Since the 3D rotation group 80(3) is a 
subgroup of the Lorentz group, every representation of the Lorentz group will also be a rep-
resentation of 80(3). In fact, finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz 
algebra, which are characterized by two half-integers (A, B), generate many representa-
tions of80(3): with spins j = A+B, A+B -1, ... , IA-BI, as shown in Table 10.1. For

example, the general tensor representations Ti-'l '''i-'n correspond to the (~, ~) representa-
tions of the Lorentz algebra. These are each irreducible representations of the Lorentz 
algebra, but reducible representations of the su(2) subalgebra corresponding to spin. 
The relevance of the decomposition in Table 10.1 for particle physics is that Lagrangians 
are constructed out of fields, Vi-'(x) and 'IjJ(x), which transform under the Lorentz group. 
However, particles transform under irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare 
group, which have spins associated with the little group (as discussed in Chapter 8). So, the 
decomposition of Lorentz representations as in Table 10.1 determines the spins of particles 
that might be described by given fields. For example, the Lorentz representation acting on 
rea14-vectors Ai-' (x) is the (!, !) representation (containing four degrees of freedom). It 
can describe spin-lor -0 representations of SO(3), with three and one degrees of freedom, 
respectively. We saw in Section 8.2.2 how the Lagrangian for a massive vector field could 
be chosen so that only the spin-l particle propagates. 
By the way, the group generated by exponentiating the Lie algebra of a given group 
is known as the universal cover of the given group. For example, exponentiating su(2) 
gives SU(2). Since SU(2) and SO(3) have the same Lie algebra, SU(2) is the universal 
cover of SO(3). The Lie algebra su(2) EB su(2) generates SL(2, q, which is there-
fore the universal cover of the Lorentz group. We will revisit the distinction between 
8L(2, q and the Lorentz group more in Section 10.5.1. For now, we will simply study 
su(2) EB su(2). Group theory is discussed further in the context of Yang-Mills theories in 
Chapter 25. 
10.2 Spinor representations 
So far we have only considered the tensor representations, Ti-'l"'i-'n' that have only integer 
spins. We will now discuss representations with half-integer spins. 
There exist two complex J = ! representations, (!, 0) and (0, !). What do these rep-
resentations actually look like? The vector spaces they act on have 2J + 1 = 2 degrees of 
freedom. Thus we need to find 2 x 2 matrices that satisfy 
[Ji, Jjl = iEijkJ-;;, 
[Ji-, In = iEijk J;, 
[Ji,Jn = o.

(10.31) 
(10.32) 
(10.33) 
Thus, we can set Ji- = ~O"i' which generates the "~" in (~, 0). What about Jt? This 
should be the "0" in (~, 0). The obvious thing to do is just take the trivial representation 
Jt = o. So the (~, 0) representation is 
(~,O) :

Since the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, at = a, the rotations are Hermitian and the boosts 
are anti-Hermitian (Kt = - K). Also notice that the group generators in the (~, 0) and 
(0, ~) representations are adjoints of each other. So we sometimes say these are complex-
conjugate representations. 
Elements of the vector space on which the spin-~ representations act are known as 
spinors. The (0, ~) spinors are called right-handed Weyl spinors and often denoted 'l/JR.

10.2.1 Unitary representations 
We have just constructed two 2D representations of the Lorentz group. But these rep-
resentations are not unitary. Unitarity means At A = 
1, which is necessary to have 
Lorentz-invariant matrix elements: 
(10044) 
Since a group element is the exponential of a generator A = eiA , unitarity requires that 
At = A, that is, that A be Hermitian. We saw that the boost generators in the spinor 
representations are instead anti-Hermitian. 
It is not hard to see that any representation constructed using SU(2) x SU(2) as above 
(which are all the finite-dimensional representations) will not be unitary. Since SU(2) is 
the special unitary algebra, all of its representations are unitary. So, the generators for the 
SU(2) x SU(2) decomposition J"""'-x = ~ (J±iK) are Hermitian. Thus exp(ie~J~ + 
ie~ J~) is unitary, for real e~ and e~ . But this does not mean that the corresponding 
representations of the Lorentz group are unitary. A Lorentz group element is 
(10045) 
where the ej are the rotation angles and (3j the boost "angles." These are real numbers. 
They are related to the angles for the h generators of SU(2) x SU(2) by e~ = ej - i{3j 
and ()~ = ej + i{3j. So for a boost, the .4 and L generators get multiplied by imaginary 
angles, which makes the transformation anti-unitary. Thus, none of the representations of 
the Lorentz group generated this way will be unitary and therefore there are no finite-
dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group. 
To construct a unitary field theory, we need unitary representations of the Poincare 
group, which are infinite dimensional; the corresponding representations of the Lorentz 
Subgroup of the Poincare group are also infinite dimensional. To construct these represen-
tations, we will use the same trick we used for spin 1 in Chapter 8. We will construct an 
infinite-dimensional representation by having the basis depend on the momentum pf1.. For 
165 

166 
Spinors 
fixed momentum, say pet = (m, 0, 0, 0) in the massive case, or pet = (E, 0, 0, E) in the 
massless case, the group reduces to the appropriate little group, 80(3) or 180(2) respec_ 
tively. These little groups do have unitary representations. Implementing this procedure for 
spin 1, we were led uniquely to Lagrangians with kinetic terms of the form -
~ F;v' and 
gauge invariance and charge conservation if m = O. We will now see how to construct 
Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians that describe unitary theories with spinors. 
10.2.2 Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians 
Having seen that we need infinite-dimensional representations, we are ,now ready to talk 
about fields. These fields are spinor-valued functions of space-time, which we write as 
V;R(X) = (~~~~D for the (O,~) representation, or v;dx) = (~~~~D for the (~, 0) 
representation. 
As in the spin-l case, we would like first to write down a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian 
for these fields with the right number of degrees of freedom (two). The simplest thing to 
do would be to write down a Lagrangian with terms such as 
(10.46) 
However, using the infinitesimal transformations Eqs. (10.39) and (10.40), it is easy to see 
that these terms are not Lorentz invariant: 
(10.47) 
This is just the manifestation of the fact that the representation is not unitary because the 
boost generators are anti-Hermitian. 
If we allow ourselves two fields, V; R and V; L, we can write down terms such as V; tv; R· 
Under infinitesimal Lorentz transformations, 
(10.48) 
which is great. We need to add the Hermitian conjugate to get a term in a real Lagrangian. 
Thus, we find that 
(10.49) 
is real and Lorentz invariant for any m. This combination is bilinear in the fields, but lacks 
derivatives, so it is a type of mass term known as a Dirac mass. A theory with only this 
term in its Lagrangian would have no dynamics. 
What about kinetic terms? We could try 
(10.50) 
which is both Lorentz invariant and real. But this is actually not a very interesting 
Lagrangian. We can always split up our field into components V;R = 
(~D, where V;1

= (3i'I/J1'I/JR - BjCijk'I/J1ak'I/JR' 
(10.51) 
Thus, we have found that 
O('l/J1'I/JR,'l/J1ai'I/JR) = ({3i'I/J1ai'I/JR,{3i'I/J1'I/JR-CijkBj'I/J1ak'I/JR), 
(10.52) 
which is exactly how a vector transforms: 
(10.53) 
as in Eq. (10.12). So VJt = ('l/J1'I/JR, 'l/J111'I/JR) is an honest-to-goodness Lorentz 4-vector. 
Therefore, 
(10.54) 
is Lorentz invariant. Note that od'I/J1'I/JR] + OJ ['l/J1aj'I/JR] is also Lorentz invariant, but not 
a viable candidate for the spinor Lagrangian since it is a total derivative. Similarly, 
(10.55) 
so ('l/Jl'I/JL, -'l/Jlai'I/JL) also transforms like a vector and the combination 'l/Jlot'I/JL -
'lfJlojaj'I/JL is Lorentz invariant. 
Defining 
aM == (1l, (1), 
aM == (1l, -(1), 
(10.56) 
we can write all the Lorentz-invariant terms we have found as 
(10.57) 
We added a factor of i in the kinetic term to make the Lagrangian Hermitian: 
(10.58) 
where we have used at = aM and integrated by parts. 
There is an even shorter-hand way to write this. Let us combine the two spinors into a 
four-component object known as a Dirac spinor:

If we also define 
(10.60) 
and lise the 4 x 4 matrices 
(10.61) 
known as Dirac matrices or ,),-matrices, our Lagrangian becomes 
(10.62) 
which is the conventional form of the Dirac Lagrangian. The equations of motion that 
follow are

Next we define a useful shorthand:

The Lorentz generators when acting on Dirac spinors can be written as

Sf.LV = 4bf.L,'"tJ = '2 O'f.LV , 
(10.68) 
which you can check by expanding in terms of O'-matrices. More generally, Sf.LV will satisfy 
the Lorentz algebra when constructed from any ,),-matrices satisfying the Clifford algebra. 
That is, you can derive from {')'f.L, ')'V} = 2gf.LV that 
(10.69) 
It is important to appreciate that the matrices S,w are different from the matrices Vf.LV 
corresponding to the Lorentz generators in the 4-vector representation. In particular, Sf.LV 
are complex. So we have found two inequivalent four-dimensional representations. In each 
case, the group element is determined by six real angles (Jf.LV (three rotations and three 
boosts). The vector or (~, ~) representation is irreducible, and has Lorentz group element 
(10.70) 
while the Dirac or (~, 0) Ell (0, ~) representation is reducible and has Lorentz group 
elements 
(10.71) 
There are actually a number of Dirac representations, depending on the form of the "1-
matrices. We will consider two: the Weyl and Majorana representations. 
In the Weyl representation, the Lorentz generators are

These are block diagonal. These are the same generators we used for the ( ~, 0) and 
(0, ~) representations above. This makes it clear that the Dirac representation of the 
Lorentz group is reducible; it is the direct sum of a left-handed and a light-handed spinor 
representation. 
Another representation is the Majorana representation:

(10.74) 
In this basis the "'I-matrices are purely imaginary. The Majorana is another (~ , 0) EEl (0, !) 
representation of the Lorentz group that is physically equivalent to the Weyl representation. 
The Weyl spinors, '¢L and '¢R, are in a way more fundamental than Dirac spinors such 
as '¢ because they cOlTespond to ilTeducible representations of the Lorentz group. But the 
electron is a Dirac spinor. More importantly, QED is symmetric under L 
+--7 R. Thus, 
for QED the "'I-matrices make calculations a lot easier than separating out the '¢ L and 
'¢ R components. In fact, we will develop such efficient machinery for manipulating the 
'Y-matlices that even in theories which are not symmetric to L +--7 R, such as the theory 
of weak interactions (Chapter 29), it will be convenient to embed the Weyl spinors into 
Dirac spinors and add projectors to remove the unphysical components. These projections 
are discussed in Section 11.1. 
10.3.1 Lorentz transformation properties 
When using Dirac matrices and spinors, we often suppress spinor indices but leave vector 
indices explicit. So an equation such as {"'II", "'IV} = 2gl"v really means 
'Y~,'Y~~ +'Y~, 'Y~~ = 2gl" v 6a~ , 
and the equation SI"V = ~ ["'!I" , "'IV] means

(10.76) 
(10.77) 
to be invaliant, the Lorentz transformations in the vector and Dirac representations must 
be related. Indeed, since 7f'YI"'¢ transforms like a 4-vector we can deduce that 
(10.78) 
where the As are the Lorentz transformations acting on spinor indices and Av are the 
Lorentz transformations in the vector representation. Wliting out the matrix indices 'Y~~ 
this means

10.3 Dirac matrices

here f.L refers to which ,-matrix, and a: and {3 index tbe element of (hal" matrix. You can 
:heck this with the explicit form~ for AI' and As in Eq . (10.70) and ( 10:71) above . . 
It is useful to study the propertle of the Loren 12 generator from the DIrac algebra Itself, 
without needing to choose a particular basis for the ,I". First note that 
hI", ,V} = 2gl"V 
==} 
(,0)2 = n, 
(,i)2 = - n. 
(10.80) 
So the eigenvalues of ,0 are ±1 and the eigenvalues of ,i are ±i. Thus, if we diagonalize 
° we will see that it is Hermitian, and if we diagonalize ,1, ,2 or ,3 we will see that they 
~r~ anti-Hermitian. This is true, in general, for any representation of the ,-matrices: 
,ot = ,0, ,it = _,i. 
(10.81) 
Then, 
(10.82) 
which implies 
(10.83) 
Again, we see that the rotations are unitary and the boosts are not. You can see this from 
the explicit representations in Eq (10.73). But because we showed it algebraically, using 
only the defining equation {,I", ,V} = 2g1"V, it is true in any representation of the Dirac 
algebra. 
Now, observe that one of the Dirac matrices is Hermitian, ,0. Moreover, 
,O,i,O = _,i = ,it, ,0,0,0 = ,0 = ,ot, 
so ,I"t = ,0,1",0. Then 
(10.84) 
,O(SI"V)t ,0 = ,0 ~ [rl"t: ,vt] ,0 = ~ [r0,l"t,O ,O,vt,O] = ~bl", ,V] = SI"V, 
(10.85) 
and so 
C"l As,O) t = ,0 exp(iBl"vSI"V)t ,0 = exp( -iBl"v,o Sl"vt ,0) = exp( -iBl"vSI"V) = A;l. 
(10.86) 
Then, finally, 
(10.87) 
which is Lorentz invariant. 
We have just been re-deriving from the Dirac algebra point of view what we found by 
hand from the Weyl point of view. We have seen that the natural conjugate for 1jJ out of

The point is that if; transforms according to A;; 1. Thus if;1jJ is Lorentz invariant. In contrast, 
7j; t 7j; is not Lorentz invariant, since 1jJ t 1jJ 
---7 (1jJ t AD (As 1jJ). For this to be invariant, we 
would need A! = A;;l, that is, for the representation of the Lorentz group to be unitary. 
171 

172 
Spinors 
----------------------~-----------------------
But the finite-dimensional spinor representation of the Lorentz group, like the 4-vector 
representation, is not unitary, because the boost generators are anti-Hermitian. As with 
vectors, for unitary representations we will need fields 'ljJ(x) that transform in infinite_ 
dimensional representations of the Poincare group. 
We can also construct objects such as 
(10.89) 
all transform like tensors under the Lorentz group. Also 
(10.90) 
is Lorentz invariant. We abbreviate this with 
(10.91) 
which is the Dirac Lagrangian. 
The Dirac equation follows from this Lagrangian by the equations of motion: 
(i/ft - m)'ljJ = O. 
(10.92) 
To be explicit, this is shorthand for 
(h~(381-' - mOa(3)'ljJ(3 = 0. 
(10.93) 
After multiplying the Dirac equation by (i/ft + m) we find 
0= (i/ft+m)(i/ft-m)'ljJ = (-~81-'8l/bl-'"V} - ~81-'8l/bl-'"Vl-m2) 'ljJ 
= _(82 + m 2 )'ljJ. 
(10.94) 
So 'ljJ satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation: 
(10.95) 
In Fourier space, this implies that on-shell spinor momenta satisfy the unique relativistic 
dispersion relation p2 = m 2 , just like scalars. Because spinors also satisfy an equation 
linear in derivatives, people sometimes say the Dirac equation is the "square root" of the 
Klein-Gordon equation. 
We can integrate the Lagrangian by parts to derive the equations of motion for ij;: 
(10.96) 
So, 
(10.97) 
This ,I-' on the opposite side from 81-' is a little annoying, so we often write 
<--
ij;(-i/ft -m)=O, 
(10.98) 
where the derivative acts to the left. This makes the conjugate equation look more like the 
original Dirac equation. 

173 
10.4 Coupling to the photon 
-------------------------~----------------- ~==~ 
10.4 Coupling to the photon 
tInder a gauge transform 'ljJ transforms just like a scalar. For a spinor with charge Q = -1, 
such as the electron, 
(10.99) 
Then we can use the same covariant derivative oJ.L + ieAJ.L as for a scalar. So 
(10.100) 
Then the Dirac equation becomes 
(if/J - eft - m)'ljJ = o. 
(10.101) 
Something very interesting happens if we try to compare the Dirac equation to the Klein-
Gordon equation for a scalar field ¢ coupled to AJ.L: 
[(ioJ.L - eAJ.L)2 - m2] ¢ = o. 
(10.102) 
Following the same route as before, we multiply 0 by (if/J - eft + m) giving 
0= (if/J - eft + m)(if/J - eft - m)'ljJ 
= [(iOJ.L - eAJ.L)(iOv - eAv)')'J.Ll'v - m2] 'ljJ 
= (~{iOJ.L - eAIL , iov - eAv}hJ.L, I'V} + ~[iOJ.L - eAJ.L, iOv - eAv]bJ.L, I'V]- m2) 'ljJ. 
(10.103) 
In Eq. (10.94), the anti symmetric combination dropped out, but now we find 
(10.104) 
So we get 
(10.105) 
where (JJ.Lv = 
~ bJ.L, I'V] as in Eq. (10.67). This equation contains an extra term compared 
to the spin-O equation, Eq. (10.102). 
The above manipulation can be condensed into the useful identity 
rfl2 _ D2 
eF 
J.LV 
11/ 
-
J.L +"2 J.Lv(J 
, 
(10.106) 
which concisely describes the difference between covariant derivatives on spinors and 
scalars. 
What is this extra term? Well, recall that the Lorentz generators acting on Dirac spinors 
are SJ.Lv = ~(JJ.Lv. These have the form (in the Weyl representation) 
(10.107) 

174 
Spinors

and since 
(10.108) 
we get

(10.109) 
This corresponds to a magnetic dipole moment. With conventional normalization, the size 
of the magnetic moment is /-lB = -2 
e 
. In the non-relativistic limit, as you can explore 
me 
in Problem 10.1, the Schrodinger-Pauli equation, Eq. (10.2), is reproduced with correct 
magnetic moment. So the Dirac equation makes a testable prediction: charged fermions 
should have magnetic dipole moments with size given by /-lB = 2!e' Experimentally, the 
moment is ~1.002/-lB. The 0.002 will be calculated later. 
To summarize, we found that while free spinors satisfy the equation of motion for a 
scalar field, when spinors are coupled to the photon, an additional interaction appears 
which corresponds to a magnetic dipole moment. The size of the electron's magnetic 
moment can be read off as the coefficient of this additional interaction. That the correct 
magnetic moment comes out of the Dirac equation is a remarkable physical prediction 
of Dirac's equation. Note that the coupling to the electric field in Eq. (10.109) is not an 
electric dipole moment - that would not have an i, but is simply the effect of a magnetic 
moment in a boosted frame. Electric dipole moments will be explored in Section 29.5.3 
and in Problem 11.10. 
Finally, note that the Noether current associated with the global symmetry 'ljJ ---+ e-iu'!jJ 
is 
(10.110) 
This, like any Noether current, is conserved on the equations of motion even if we set 
AI-' = O. The 0 component of this current gives the charge density 
(10.111) 
We originally hoped this would be Lorentz invariant, which it is not. Now we see that it 
transforms as the 0 component of a conserved current. We can interpret this as the prob-
ability density for a fermion. The conserved charge Q = J d3xJo is electron number, 
which is the number of electrons minus the number of positrons. The spatial components 
of J I-' denote electron number flow. The electron number current J I-' is related to the charge 
current eJI-" which couples to AI-" by a factor of the electric charge e. 
10.5 What does spin ~ mean? 
To understand spin-~ particles, let us begin by looking at what happens when we rotate 
them by an angle e in the z plane. For any representation, such a rotation is given by

Spinors 
--------------------------~-------------------------~ 
Thus, a 21f rotation does not bring us back where we started! If we rotate by 41f it WOUld 
but with a 21f rotation we pick up a -1. 
' 
By the way, this odd factor of -1 is the origin of the connection between spin and 
statistics. As a quick way to see the connection, consider a state containing two identical 
fermions localized on opposite sides of the origin in the :i; direction. Let their spins both 
point in the +z direction. So the state is l7/!d = l7/!i (i) 'ljJj (-i)). Now rotate the state 
around the z axis by 1f. Such a rotation interchanges the two particles, and does not affect 
the spins. It also induces a factor of As(1f) = i for each spinor. Thus, 17/!12) ~ -11/121) 
since the particles are identical, I7/! 12) = 17/!21). Thus, the wavefunction picks up a -1 
when the particles are interchanged. That is, the spinors are fermions. This argument is 
repeated with somewhat more detail in Chapter 12, where additional implications of the 
spin-statistics theorem are discussed. 
10.5.1 Projective representations 
How can something go back to minus itself under a 21f rotation? This is not something that 
can happen in the Lorentz group. By definition, all representations of the Lorentz group 
map 21f rotations to the identity element of the group: r [21f] = ]. And, by definition, the 
identity group element sends objects to themselves. The problem is that by exponentiating 
elements of the Lie algebra for the group we generated a different group, SL(2, <C), which 
is the universal cover of the Lorentz group, not the Lorentz group itself. So, technically, 
spinors transform as representations of SL(2, q . Why is this OK? 
Recall that the Lorentz group is defined as the group preserving the Minkowski metric 
AT gA = g. Observables, in particular the S-matrix, should be invariant under this sym-
metry. In quantum mechanics, we learned that states are identified with rays, so that I7/!) 
and AI7/!) for any complex number A are the same state. In field theory, we have care-
fully normalized our fields (and we will carefully renormalize them), so we do not want 
that norm to change in different frames. However, we can still have the fields change by 
a phase without upsetting their norms. Thus, for physical purposes what we are looking 
for is not exactly representations of the Lorentz group, but projective representations of 
the Lorentz group, in which group elements can change the phase of a state. Projective 
representations can have 
(10.120) 
which is a generalization of the normal requirement that r[glg2] = r[gllr[g2] for a group 
representation. The projective representations of 0 (1, 3) are the same as the representations 
of SL(2, q, which include the spinors. 
Using objects that have properties that are not directly observable is not new. For exam-
ple, in quantum mechanics we learned that wavefunctions are complex. There are plenty 
of implications of the complexity, but you do not actually measure complex things. In the 
same way, although we only measure Lorentz-invariant things (matrix elements), the most 
general theory can have objects, spinors, that are a little bit more complicated than the 
Lorentz group alone would naively suggest. Although spinors transform in representations 
of SL(2, q, the Poincare group is still the symmetry group of observables.

To prove that SO(3) is not simply connected, consider the geometric pictures shown 
in Figure 10.1. Any rotation in SO(3) can be specified by an axis 11 and an angle 
-1r S Bv < 1r. If we think of the axis as a point on the surface of a ball of radius T' = 1r, 
then the rotation can be specified by a point in the ball, with the distance from the origin 
being the angle Bv. Thus, a path through the group is a path through the ball. The identity 
group element is the center of the ball. There is one catch, however: rotations about an axis 
by an angle Bv are the same as rotations about an axis pointing in the opposite direction by 
the angle -Bv. ThLls, we have to identify antipodal points on the sphere as the same group 
element in SO(3). In this sense, 80(3) is a real projective space B 3/'"£2 = 1R1P'3. The full 
ball is SU(2), which is the universal cover of SO(3), and '"£2 is the fundamental group of 
SO(3) (for the full Lorentz group, the cover is SL(2, C)) and the fundamental group is 
still '"£2. 
The group 80(3) can be thought of as a ball of radius 7r with antipodal points identified. On 
the left is a contractible path through 80(3) and on the right is a non-contractible path. 
177 

178 
Spinors 
-
Paths from]' to]. in 80(3) go from the center of the ball back to the center. Figure 10.1 
shows examples of contractible and non-contractible paths. Remember that the antipodal 
points on the sphere are 7f and -7f rotations around the same axis, so they are the same 
group element, which is why the second path cannot be deformed to the identity without 
breaking the line. 
You can actually see these non-contractible paths without too much difficulty by jUst 
holding something (like a glass of water) in your hand with your arm outstretched and 
rotating your arm 360 degrees in a plane parallel to your body. Then your arm (the path) 
will be twisted, but the object in your hand will have mapped back· to itself. You can 
untangle your arm (the path) with another 360 degree rotation, in this case in a plane 
parallel to the ground, which gives another Z2 undoing the twist. Jfyou are careful, you will 
not even spill the water. Spinors maintain an imprint of how they have been rotated, which 
shows up as a minus sign after a 27f rotation, much like your arm would if it were an internal 
degree of freedom of the glass of water. This demonstration is sometimes called Dirac's 
belt trick, Feynman's plate trick, the Balinese cup trick or the quaternionic handshake. 
10.6 Majorana and Weyl fermions 
For QED, one only needs the electron, which is efficiently described in the reducible Dirac 
representation (~, 0) EB (0, ~) of the Lorentz group. In other theories, such as the Standard 
Model or supersymmetric theories, spinors that are not Dirac spinors are prevalent. In this 
section we discuss other Lorentz-invariant quantities that can be constructed using spinors 
that are not in the Dirac representation and introduce some efficient notation. 
10.6.1 Majorana masses 
There is one more way to get a Lorentz-invariant quantity out of 'l/JL and 'l/JR. Recall that 
we could not write down a mass term 'l/J1'l/JR for just a right-handed spinor. The Lorentz 
transformations, in Eq. (10.41), 
1 . 
O'l/JR = 2(~ej + (3j)Oj'l/JR, 
(10.122) 
imply that the natural candidate mass term m'l/J1'l/JR is not boost invariant: 
O('l/J1'l/JR) = {3j'l/J10j'l/JR =J O. 
(10.123) 
It turns out that there is different bilinear quantity that is Lorentz invariant: 
LMaj = 'l/Jko2'l/JR. 
(10.124) 
This is known as a Majorana mass. 
To see the Lorentz invariance, recall that for the Pauli matrices 01 and 03 are real, and 
02 is imaginary: 
( 0 -i) 
02 = 
i 
0 
'

af = - a2,

(10.126) 
(10.127) 
This implies al a2 = ala2 = - a2a l, aT a2 = a3a2 = -a2a3 and af a2 = -a2a2· 
That is, 
(10.128) 
and so 
(10.129) 
combining this with the transformation of 'if;R in Eq. (10.122) we see that CMaj in Eq. 
(10.124) is Lorentz invariant. 
Since a2 = (i -i) the Majorana mass can be expanded out to 
(10.130) 
Thus, we have shown that 'if; I 'if;2 - 'if;2'if;1 is Lorentz invariant. We often write this as 
'if;1'if;2-'if;2'if;1 ='if;a'if;{3ca{3, 
ca{3= (~1 ~) 
(10.131) 
which avoids picking a a2. 
There is only one problem: if the fermion components commute, 'if;1'if;2 - 'if;2'if;1 = O! For 
Majorana masses to be non-trivial, fermion components cannot be regular numbers, they 
must be anticornrnuting numbers. Such things are called Grassmann numbers and satisfy 
a Grassmann algebra. Further explanation of why spinors must anticornrnute is given in 
Chapter 12, on the spin-statistics theorem. The mathematics of Grassmann numbers is 
discussed more in Section 14.6 on the path integral. 
10.6.2 Notation for Weyl spinors 
In QED, we will be mostly interested in Dirac spinors, such as the electron. But since 
Weyl spinors correspond to irreducible representations of the Lorentz group, it is some-
times helpful to have concise notation for constructing products and contractions of Weyl 
spinors only. This notation is useful in many contexts besides gauge theories, such as super-
symmetry. It is also related to the spinor-helicity formalism we will discuss in Chapter 27. 
If you are just interested in QED, you can skip this part. 
Let us write 'if; for left-handed spinors and ;p for right-handed spinors. Sometimes the 
notation ;p is used, especially in the contexts of supersymmetry, but this can be confused 
with the bar notation for a Dirac spinor, ;p == 'if; t ,0, so we will stick with ;Po We index the 
two components ofleft-handed Weyl spinors with Greek indices from the beginning of the 
alphabet, i.e. 'if;a. For right-handed spinors, we use dotted Greek indices, i.e. ?fia. A Dirac 
spinor is 
179 

180 
Spinors 
------------------------------~----------------------------------
(10.132) 
Conventionally, left-handed spinors (and right-handed antispinors) have upper un dotted 
indices and right-handed spinors (and left-handed antispinors) have lower dotted indices. 
Recall that we showed that a Majorana mass is Lorentz invariant. This mass has the forlll. 
Lrnaj = 1/JT (J"21/J = -i (1/Jl1/J2 -1/J21/Jl) = i1/JaEa/31/J/3, 
where E"'/3 = -i(J"~(3 is the totally antisymmetric 2 x 2 tensor

- -Ea/3-

(10.133) 
(10.134) 
That is, E12 = E21 = 1, which leads to ca(3E/3, = o~. The E tensor serves the func-
tion for Weyl spinors that gIL" does for tensors - we can always contract spinors into 
Lorentz-invariant combinations with the E tensor. However, we have to be careful raising 
and lowering indices, since 
(10.135) 
While it seems that the index position makes things messy, it actually makes things eas-
ier, since spinors anticommute. We can define the inner product between two left-handed 
spinors as 
(10.136) 
so that the product is symmetric. Note that 1/J1/J =I 0 even though 1/Ja1/Ja = O. For right-
handed spinors, we define 
(10.137) 
which is also symmetric. I 
For Weyl spinors, the (J"-matrices (J"IL = (1, a) and (j1L = (1, -a) replace the Dirac 
,),-matrices. Recall that the kinetic term for a Dirac spinor 1/J = (1/J, X) is 
(10.138) 
Each of these two terms is separately Lorentz invariant. With spinor indices, (J"IL = (J"~a' 
the contractions are 
(10.139) 
where we have defined a left-handed spinor X == xt so that we can drop the t. You can 
think of X as the particle and X as the antiparticle for the same Weyl spinoI'. Similarly, 
(10.140) 
I These are opposite conventions to [Wess and Bagger, 1992], but consistent with what is used in spinor-helicity 
calculations (Chapter 27).

Problems 
We saw that the Dirac equation predicted that there is interaction between the elec-
tron spin and the magnetic field, siJ, with strength JlB = 2lic . When the electron 
me 
has angular momentum i, such as in an atomic orbital, there is also a iJi interaction 
and a spin-orbit coupling sE. The Dirac equation (along with symmetry arguments) 
predicts the strength of all three interactions, as well as other corrections. To see the 
effect of these terms on the hydrogen atom, we have to take the non-relativistic limit. 
(a) For the Schrodinger equation, we need the Hamiltonian, not the Lagrangian. 
Find the Dirac Hamiltonian by writing the Dirac equation as i8t 't/J = HD't/J. 
Write the Hamiltonian in terms of momenta Pi rather than derivatives 8i . 
(b) Calculate (HD + eAo)2 in the Weyl representation for 't/J = ('t/JL't/JR). Leave in 
terms of ai, Pi and Ai. Put back in the factors of c and n, keeping the charge e 
dimensionless. 
(c) Now take the square root of this result and expand in ~, subtracting off the zero-
point energy mc2 , i.e. compute H = HD - mc2 to order co. Looking at the ai 
term, how big are the electron's electric and magnetic dipole moments? 
(d) The size of the terms in this Hamiltonian are only meaningful because the spin 
and angular momentum operators have the same normalization. Check the nor-
malization of the angular momentum operators Li = CijkXjPk and the spin 
operators Si = 
~ai by showing that they both satisfy the rotation algebra: 
[Ji , Jj ] = iCijdk. 
(e) The gyromagnetic ratio, ge (sometimes called the 9-factor), is the relative size 
of the S iJ and iiJ interactions. Choose a constant magnetic field in the z direc-
tion, then isolate the BzLz coupling in H. Extract the electron gyromagnetic 
ratio ge by writing the entire coupling to the magnetic field in the Hamilto-
nian as JlBBz(Lz + geSz) = BzJlz, with ji == JlB(i + geS). How could you 
experimentally measure ge (e.g. with spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom)? 
(f) In spherical coordinates, the Schrodinger equation has a £2 term. With spin, 
you might expect that this becomes iji = JlB (i2 + geiS), making the is term 
proportional to the g-factor. This is wrong. It misses an important relativistic 
effect, Thomas precession. It is very hard to calculate directly, but easy to calcu-
late using symmetries. With no magnetic field, the atom, with spin included, is 
still rotationally invariant. Which of j = i + S or ji = i + geS is conserved 

182 
Spinors 
(i.e. commutes with H)? Using this result, how does the spin-orbit coupling 
depend on ge? 
(g) There are additional relativistic effects coming from the Dirac equation. Expand 
the Dirac equation to next order in ~, producing a term that scales as p4. 
(h) Now let us do some dimensional analysis - there is only one scale me. Show that 
the electron's Compton wavelength, the classical electron radius, re , the Bohr 
radius, ao, and the inverse-Rydberg constant, Ry-I, are all me times powers of 
a e . Are the splittings due to the p4 term fine structure (6.E rv a~E), hyperfine 
structure (6.E rv a!E) or something else? [Hint: write out a formula for the 
energy shift using time-dependent perturbation theory, then see which of the 
above length scales appears.] 
10.2 In this problem you will construct the finite-dimensional irreducible representations 
of SU(2). By definition, such a representation is a set of three n x n matrices TI, T2 
and T3 satisfying the algebra of the Pauli matrices h, Tj 1 = iCij k Tk. It is also helpfUl 
to define the linear combinations T± = TI ± iT2. 
(a) In any such representation we can diagonalize T3.lts eigenvectors are n complex 
vectors Vj with T3 Vj = Aj Vj. Show that T+Vj and T-Vj either vanish or are 
eigenstates of T3 with eigenvalues Aj + 1 and Aj - 1 respectively.

Spinor solutions and CPT 
.. ,-,

I 
In the previous chapter, we cataloged the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group 
0(1, 3), We found that in addition to the obvious tensor representations, cp, A!J.' h!J.v etc., 
there are a whole set of spinor representations, such as Weyl spinors 'ljJL, 'ljJR. A Dirac 
spinor 'ljJ transforms in the reducible (~, 0) EB (0, ~) representation. We also found Lorentz-
invariant Lagrangians for spinor fields, 'ljJ(x). The next step towards quantizing a theory 
with spinors is to use these Lorentz group representations to generate irreducible unitary 
representations of the Poincare group. 
We discussed how unitary representations of the Poincare group are induced from rep-
resentations of its little group. The little group is the group that leaves a given momentum 
4-vector P!J. invariant. When P!J. is massive, the little group is 80(3); when P!J. is mass-
less, the little group is ISO(2). As a consequence, massive particles of spin j should have 
2j + 1 degrees of freedom and massless particles of any spin > 0 have two degrees 
of freedom. In the spin-l case, we found that there were ambiguities in what the free 
Lagrangian was (it could have been aA!J.DA!J. + bA!J.o!J.ovAv for any a and b), but we 
found that there was a unique Lagrangian that propagated the correct degrees of free-
dom. We then solved the free equations of motion for a fixed momentum P!J. generating 
two or three polarizations f~(p). These solutions, which were representations of the lit-
tle group, if known for every value of P!J., induce representations of the full Poincare 
group. 
For the spin-~ case, there is a unique free Lagrangian (up to Majorana masses) that 
automatically propagates the right degrees of freedom. In this sense, spin ~ is easier 
than spin 1, since there are no unphysical degrees of freedom. The mass term couples 
left- and right-handed spinors, so it is natural to use the Dirac representation. As in the 
spin-l case, we will solve the free equations of motion to find basis spinors, Us (p) and 
vs(p) (analogs of f~), which we will use to define our quantum fields. As with complex 
scalars, we will naturally find both particles and antiparticles in the spectrum with the 
same mass and opposite charge: these properties fall out of the unique Lagrangian we can 
write down. 
A spin or can also be its own antiparticle, in which case we call it a Majorana spinor. 
As we saw, since particles and antiparticles have opposite charges, Majorana spinors must 
be neutral. We will define the operation of charge conjugation C as taking particles to 
antiparticles, so Majorana spinors are invariant under C. After introducing C, it is natural 
to continue to discuss how the discrete symmetries parity, P, and time reversal, T, act on 
spinors.

11.1 Chirality, helicity and spin 
--------------------------------------~------------------ ~------
11.1 Chirality, helicity and spin 
In a relativistic theory, spin can be a confusing subject. There are actually three concepts 
associated with spin: spin, helicity and chirality. In this section we define and distinguish 
these different quantities. 
Recall from Eq. (10.105) that the Dirac equation (iI/J - m)'IjJ = 0 implies 
(( .!l 
_ 
A )2 _ ~F 
I-'V 
2) .1. - 0

(11.1) 
and for the conjugate field if; = 'IjJ t ,0, 
if; ((i 8" I-' + eAI-')2 + ~ Fl-'vIJI-'V - m2) = O. 
(11.2) 
Thus, if; is a particle with mass m and charge opposite to 'IjJ; that is, if; is the antiparticle 
of 1/J. We will often call 1/J an electron and if a positron, although there are many other 
particle-antiparticle pairs described by the Dirac equation besides these. 
When we constructed the Dirac representation, we saw that it was the direct sum of 
twO irreducible representations of the Lorentz group: (~, 0) EB (0, ~). Now we see that it 
describes two physically distinguishable particles: the electron and the positron. Irreducible 
unitary spin-~ representations of the Poincare group, Weyl spinors, have two degrees of 
freedom. Dirac spinors have four. These are two spin states for the electron and two spin 
states for the positron. For charged spinors, there is no other way. Uncharged spinors can 
be their own antiparticles if they are Majorana spinors, as discussed in Section 11.3 below. 
To understand the degrees of freedom within a four-component Dirac spinor, first recall 
that in the Weyl basis the ,-matrices have the form 
IJI-') 
o ' 
(11.3) 
and the Lorentz generators SI-'V = ± [,1-', ,V] are block diagonal. Under an infinitesimal 
Lorentz transformation, 
(11.4) 
In this basis, a Dirac spinor is a doublet of a left- and a right-handed Weyl spinor: 
(11.5) 
Here left-handed and right-handed refer to the (~, 0) or (O,~) representations of the 
Lorentz group. The handedness of a spinor is also known as its chirality. 
It is helpful to be able to project out the left- or right-handed Weyl spinors from a Dirac 
spinor. We can do that with the ,5-matrix: 
(11.6) 

186 
Spinor solutions and CPT 
In the Weyl representation 
(11.7) 
so left- and right-handed spinors are eigenstates of ,5 with eigenvalues =fl. We can also 
define projection operators, 
(11.8) 
which satisfy pi = PR and pi = PL and 
(11.9) 
Writing projectors as 1~,5 is basis independent. 
It is easy to check that (,5) 2 = ]. and {,5, ,IL} = O. Thus ,5 is like another ,_ 
matrix, which is why we call it ,5, This lets us formally extend the Clifford algebra to 
five generators, ,M = ,0, ,1, ,2, ,3, h 5 so that {,M, ,N} = 2gM N with gM N = 
diag (1, -1, -1, -1, -1). If we were looking at representations of the five-dimensional 
Lorentz group, we would use this extended Clifford algebra. See [Polchinski, 1998] for a 
discussion of spinors in various dimensions. 
To understand the degrees of freedom in the spin or, let us focus on the free theory. In the 
Weyl basis, the Dirac equation is 
(11.10) 
In Fourier space, this implies 
(11.11) 
(11.12) 
So the mass mixes the left- and right-handed states. 
In the absence of a mass, left- and right-handed states are eigenstates of the operator 
h = ft with opposite eigenvalue, since E = 1P1 for massless particles. This operator 
projects the spin on the momentum direction. Spin projected on the direction of motion is 
called the helicity, so the left- and right-handed states have opposite helicity in the massless 
theory. 
When there is a mass, the left- and right-handed fields mix due to the equations of 
motion. However, since momentum and spin are good quantum numbers in the free theory, 
even with a mass, helicity is conserved as well. Therefore, helicity can still be a useful con-
cept for the massive theory. The distinction is that, when there is a mass, helicity eigenstates 
are no longer the same as the chirality eigenstates 'ljJL and 'ljJR. 
By the way, the independent solutions to the free equations of motion for massless 
particles of any spin are the helicity eigenstates. For any spin, we will always find 
§ . iN's = ±s 1P1 \jJ s, where § = J are the rotation generators in the Lorentz group for

ior example, h has eigenvalue ± 1 with eigen tate ' (0 'i, L 0) and (0 - i, l 0). The e 
are the tate of circularly polarized light inlhc z direction, which are helicilY eigen tales.

We have seen lhat the lefl- and righl-handed hira/if)' tales ',h and 1f;n 
• do not mix under Lorentz transformations - they transform in separate irreducible 
representations. 
• each have two components on which the a-matrices act. These are the two spin states of 
the electron; both left- and right-handed spinors have two spin states. 
• are eigenstates of helicity in the massless limit. 
We have now seen three different spin-related quantities: 
Spin is a vector quantity. We say spin up, or spin down, spin left, etc. It is the eigenvalue 
of 5 = % for a fermion. If there is no angular momentum, for example for a single particle, 
the spin and the rotation operators are identical 5 = J We also talk about spin s as 
a scalar, which is the eigenvalue s(s + 1) of the operator 52. When we say spin ~ we 
1 
mean s = 2' 
Helicity refers to the projection of spin on the direction of motion. Helicity eigenstates 
satisfy M'I}! = ± \[!. Helicity eigenstates exist for any spin. The helicity eigenstates of the 
photon correspond to what we normally call circularly polarized light. 
Chirality is a concept that only exists for spinors, or more precisely for (A, B) rep-
resentations of the Lorentz group with A i= B. You may remember the word chiral 
from chemistry: DNA is chiral, so is glucose and many organic molecules. These are not 
symmetric under reflection in a mirror. In field theory, a chiral theory is one that is not 
symmetric on interchange of the (A, B) representations with the (B, A) representations. 
Almost always, chirality means that a theory is not symmetric between left-handed Weyl 
spinors 1/; L and right-handed spinors 1/; R. These chiral spinors can also be written as Dirac 
spinors that are eigenstates of 'Y5. By abuse of notation we aJso write 1/; Land 1/; R for Dirac 
spinors, with 'Y51/; L = - 1/; Land 'Y51/; R = 1/; R· Whether a Weyl or Dirac spinal' is meant by 
1/; Land 1/; R will be clear from context. Chirality works for higher half-integer spins too. For 
example, a spin- ~ field can be put in a Dirac spinor with a f-L index, 1/;1-" Then "/51/;/1- = ±1/;/1-
are the chirality eigenstates. 
Whether spin, helicity or chirality is important depends on the physical question you are 
interested in. For free massless spinors, the spin eigenstates are also helicity eigenstates 
and chirality eigenstates. In other words, the Hamiltonian for the massless Dirac equation 
COmmutes with the operators for chirality, "/5, helicity, ¥, and the spin operators, S. The 
QED interaction ¢$1/; = ¢£.Ift.1/;L + ¢R$1/;R is non-chiral, that is, it preserves chirality. 
fIelicity, on the other hand, is not necessarily preserved by QED: if a left-handed spinor 
has its direction reversed by an electric field, its helicity flips. When particles are massless 
187 

188 
Spinor solutions and CPT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------~ 
(or ultra-relativistic) they do not change direction so easily, but the helicity can flip due to 
an interaction. 
In the massive case, it is also possible to take the non-relativistic limit. Then it is often 
better to talk about spin, the vector. Projecting on the direction of motion does not make So 
much sense when the particle is nearly at rest, or in a gas, say, when its direction of motion 
is constantly changing. The QED interactions do not preserve spin, however; only a strong 
magnetic field can flip an electron's spin. So, as long as magnetic fields are weak, spin is a 
good quantum number. That is why spin is used in quantum mechanics. 
In QED, we hardly ever talk about chirality. The word is basically reserved for chiral 
theories, which are theories that are not symmetric under L t-+ R, such as the theory of 
the weak interactions. We talk very often about helicity. In the high-energy limit, helicity 
is often used interchangeably with chirality. As a slight abuse of terminology, we say 'lj;L 
and 'lj;R are helicity eigenstates. In the non-relativistic limit, we use helicity for photons 
and spin (the vector) for spinors. Helicity eigenstates for photons are circularly polarized 
light. 
11.2 Solving the Dirac equation 
Now let us solve the free Dirac equation. Since spinors satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation, 
(0 + m 2 )'Ij; = 0 (in addition to the Dirac equation) they have plane-wave solutions: 
of, ( 
) - J d

(11.13) 
with Po = ViP + m2 > O. These are like the solutions AIL(x) = J Cg:)4 Ell (p)eipx for 
spin-1 plane waves. There are of course also solutions to (0 + m 2 )'Ij; = 0 with po < O. We 
will give these antiparticle interpretations, as in the complex scalar case (Chapter 9), and 
write 
( ) -J d
3
p 
() ipx 
Xs X -
(21f)3vS p e 
, 
(11.14) 
also with Po = Jtp + m 2 > O. These are classical solutions, but the quantum ver-
sions will annihilate particles and create the appropriate positive-energy antiparticles. The 
spinors Us (p) and Vs (p) are the polarizations for particles and antiparticles, respectively. 
They transform under the Poincare group through the transformation of plL and the little 
group that stabilizes plL. Thus, we only need to find explicit solutions for fixed pIL, as we 
did for the spin-1 polarizations. 
To find the spinor solutions, we use the Dirac equation in the Weyl basis: 
( 
-m

The Dirac spinor is a complex four-component object, with eight real degrees of freedom. 
The equations of motion reduce it to four degrees of freedom, which, as we will see, can 
be interpreted as spin up and spin down for particle and antiparticle. 
To derive a more general expression, we can solve the equations again in the boosted 
frame and match the normalization. If pI-' = (E, 0, O,Pz) then

In any frame US are the positive frequency electrons, and the v

electrons, or equivalently, positive frequency positrons. 
For massless spinors, pz = ±E and the explicit solutions in Eq. (l1.26) are 4-vectors 
with one non-zero component describing spinors with fixed helicity. The spinor solutions 
for massless electrons are sometimes called polarizations, and are useful for computing 
polarized electron scattering amplitudes. 
For Weyl spinors, there are only four real degrees of freedom off-shell and two real 
degrees of freedom on-shell. Recalling that the Dirac equation splits up into separate equa-
tions for'lj;L and 'lj;R, the Dirac spinors with zeros in the bottom two rows will be 'lj;L and 
those with zeros in the top two rows will be 'lj;R. Since'lj;L and 'lj;R have two degrees of 
freedom each, these must be particle and antiparticle for the same helicity. The embed-
ding of Weyl spinors into fields this way induces irreducible unitary representations of the 
Poincare group for m = O. 
11.2.1 Normalization and spin sums 
To figure out what the normalization is that we have implicitly chosen, let us compute the 
inner product: 

11.2 Solving the Dirac equation 
---
(11.27) 
Similarly, Vs (p )VSI (p) = -2mossl. This is the (conventional) normalization for the spinor 
inner product for massive Dirac spinors. It is also easy to check that Vs (p )USI (p) = 
uS(p)VSI(P) = O. 
We can also calculate 
(11.28) 
and similarly, v!(p )VSI (p) = 2Eoss'. This is the conventional normalization for massless 
Dirac spinors. Another useful relation is that, if we define pI" = (Ep, - PJ as a momentum 
backwards to pI", then v!(p )USI (p) = u1(p )VSI (p) = O. 
We can also compute the spinor outer product: 
2 L us(p)Us(p) = p + m, 
(11.29) 
s=l 
where the sum is over the spins. Both sides of this equation are matrices. It may help to 
think of this equation as Ls Is) (sl. For the antiparticles, 
2 L vs(p)vs(p) = p - m. 
(11.30) 
8=1 
You should verify these relations on your own (see Problem 11.2). 
To keep straight the inner and outer products, it may be helpful to compare to spin-l 
particles. We have found 
(sis') : 
f~*Pf~(p) = _ oij 
L IS)(81 :

8=1 
(11.32) 
So, When we sum over internal spin indices, we use an inner product and get a number. 
When we sum over polarizations/spins, we get a matrix.

Spinor solutions and CPT 
---------------------------------------------------------------~ 
11.3 Majorana spinors 
Recall from Section 10.6 that if we allow fermions to be anticommuting Grassmann nUrn_ 
bers (these "numbers" will be discussed more formally in Section 14.6) then we can write 
down a Lagrangian for a single Weyl spinor with a mass term: 
(11.33) 
The mass terms in this Lagrangian are called Majorana masses, and the Lagrangian is 
said to describe Majorana fermions. Majorana fermions transform under the same repre_ 
sentations of the Lorentz group as Weyl fermions. The distinction comes in the quanturn 
theory in which Majorana fermions are their own antiparticles. We will make this more 
precise through the notion of charge conjugation defined below. 
It is sometimes useful to use the Dirac algebra to represent Majorana fermions, like 
we use it to describe Weyl fermions with the PR / L = 
~(1 ± ')'5) projection operators. 
Majorana fermions can be put in four-component Dirac spinors as 
(11.34) 
This transforms like a Dirac spinor because (J"2'l/Jt transforms like 'l/JR. Then the Majorana 
mass can be written as 
m-
.m( t 
* 
T 
) 
2'l/J'l/J = ~2 'l/JL(J"2'l/JL - 'l/JL(J"2'l/JL , 
(11.35) 
which agrees with Eq. (11.33). 
Note that (in the Weyl basis), using (J"~ = ],

(-i) (-1 ) (J"2'l/Jt

i(J"2'l/Jt

(11.36) 
Let us then define the operation of charge conjugation C by 
(11.37) 
where 'l/Jc == -i')'2'l/J* means the charge conjugate of the fermion 'l/J. Thus, a Majorana 
fermion is its own charge conjugate. 
To understand why C is called charge conjugation, take the complex conjugate of the 
Dirac equation (if/J - ei - m)'l/J = 0 to get 
(11.38) 
which implies 
(11.39) 
Now recall that in the Weyl basis ')'2 is imaginary and ')'0, ')'1 and ')'3 are real. (Of course, 
we could just as well have taken ')'3 or ')'1 imaginary and ')'2 real, but it is conventional to

pick out "12') So w~ can define a new representation of the "I-matrices by iiJ. = "12"1;"12. 
This satisfies the DlIac algebra because "I~ = -1. So we get 
(iiiJ.oiJ. + eiiJ.AiJ. - m)'lj;c = 0, 
(11.40) 
which shows that 'lj;c satisfies the Dirac equation, albeit in a different "I-basis. Since the 
physics is basis independent, we can read off that 'lj;c has the opposite charge from 'lj;, 
justifying why we call this charge conjugation. 
Because 'lj; = 'lj;c = -i"{2'lj;* for Majorana fermions, they cannot be charged under any 
U(1) gauged or global symmetry of a theory. Under such a symmetry 'lj; -t eia'lj; and 
1/!c -t e-ia'lj;c, so 'lj; = 'lj;c cannot hold. We can also see this through the mass term, which 
is not invariant under the U(l) transformation: 
(11.41) 
This is true for gauge charges, that is those with a corresponding gauge boson, such as 
the photon, and also for global charges such as lepton number (which counts the num-
ber of electrons and neutrinos minus the number of positrons and antineutrinos), which 
have no associated gauge boson. If there are multiple Majorana fermions, they can trans-
form together under a real representations of an internal non-Abelian symmetry group. 
For example, gluinos in supersymmetry can be Majorana, transforming under the adjoint 
representation of SU(3). Non-Abelian gauge groups are introduced in Chapter 25. 
There are particles in nature called neutrinos, which apparently carry no charges. Thus, 
they may be Majorana or Dirac fermions. In fact, a number of experiments are trying hard 
to find out if neutrinos are Majorana (see Problem 11.9). Neutrino masses are discussed in 
Section 29.3.4. Weyl spinors do exist in nature, in an obvious way, since Dirac spinors are 
just two Weyl spinors put together. But Weyl spinors are also integral to the theory of weak 
interactions, which is chiral. A summary of the distinctions among spinoI' types is given in 
Box 11.1. 
11.4 Charge conjugation 
The notion of charge conjugation, under which Majorana fermions are invariant, can be 
applied to any four-dimensional spinor. For example, we can see how it affects the different 
spins of a Dirac spinor. Recall from Eq. (11.18) that a basis for a free Dirac spinor in its 
rest frame is given by

and so on, giving 
(1l.44) 
Thus, charge conjugation takes particles to antiparticles and flips the spin. In particular, 
invariance under C of a theory constrains how different spin states interact. 
Charge conjugation mayor may not be a symmetry of a particular Lagrangian. The 
operation of charge conjugation acts on spinors and their conjugates by 
C: 
'lj; --t -iT2'lj;*. 
In the Weyl basis, ')'2 = -')'2 and ')'f = ')'2, so 
C : 
'lj;* --t - i')'2'lj;, 
and in particular C 2 = 1, which is why C is called a conjugation operator. Then 
The transpose on a spinor is not really necessary. This last expression just means 
Now, anticommuting the spinors, relabeling a <-4 /3 and combining shows that 
Thus, 
Similarly, 
So the free Dirac Lagrangian is C invariant. 
We can also check that

(11.55) 
(11.56) 
Recall that the full Lorentz group, 0(1, 3), is the group of 4 x 4 matrices A with AT gA = g. 
In addition to the transformations smoothly connected to -n, this group also contains the 
transformations of parity and time reversal: 
P: (t, x) -+ (t, -x), 
T: 
(t,x) -+ (- t,x). 
(11.57) 
(11.58) 
Just as with charge conjugation, we would like to know how to define these transformations 
acting on spinors, and other fields, so that they are symmetries of QED or whatever theory 
We are stUdying. 
You might expect that the action of P and T should be determined from representation 
theory. However, recall that technically spinol's do not actually transform under the Lorentz 
group, 0(1, 3), only its universal cover, SL(2, C), so we are not guaranteed that T and P 
will act in any nice way on irreducible spinor representations. In fact they do not. Although 
We can define an action of T and P on spinors (and other fields), these definitions are only 
195 

196 
Spinor solutions and CPT 
------------------------------------------------------------------
useful to the extent that they are symmetries of the theory we are interested in. For example, 
we will define P so that it is a good symmetry of QED, but there is no way to define it 
so that it is preserved under the weak interactions. In any representation, we should have 
p 2 = T2 = 1. 
11.5.1 Scalars and vectors 
Before discussing vectors and spinors, let us begin with real scalar fields. For real scalars, 
parity should be a symmetry of the kinetic terms £ = - h&D¢ -
~m2¢2 or we are dead 
in the water. Thus, p 2 = 1 (we do not need to use p2 = 1 in the Lorentz group for this 
argument) and there are two choices: 
P: 
¢(t, x) ----t ±¢(t, -x). 
(11.59) 
The sign is known as the intrinsic parity of a particle. In nature, there are particles with 
even parity (scalars, such as the Higgs boson) and particles with odd parity (pseudoscalars, 
such as the ?fo). Since the action integrates over all x, we can change x ----t - x and the 
action will be invariant. 
For complex scalars, the free theory has Lagrangian £ = - ¢*D¢ - m 2 ¢* ¢, so the most 
general possibility is 
P: 
¢(t, x) ----t 'TJ¢(t, -x), 
(11.60) 
where'TJ is a pure phase. Recall that charged scalars always have a global symmetry under 
¢ ----t ein:¢ for a constant ct, which is why they can couple to the photon. So 'f/ is not even 
well defined, since we can always combine this transformation with a phase rotation and 
still have a symmetry. However, all charged particles must rotate the same way under the 
global symmetry of QED, so if we pick a convention for the phase of one charged particle, 
the phase of the others then becomes physical. 
We can go further, and redefine P so that all the parity phases for all particles are ±1. 
To see that, suppose 'f/ = ein:Q , where Q is the charge of ¢ and ct E IR. Then the operator 
pi = Pe-i%Q is also a legitimate discrete symmetry, which satisfies (PI)2 : '¢ ----t '¢, so 
(p
l )2 = -no Thus, we might as well call this parity, P, and P : '¢ ----t ±'¢. We actually 
have three global continuous symmetries in the Standard Model: lepton number (leptons 
only), baryon number (quarks only) and charge. Thus, we can pick three phases, which 
conventionally are taken so that the proton, neutron and electron all have parity + 1. Then, 
every other particle has parity ±1. 
From nuclear physics measurements, it was deduced that the pion, ?fo, and its charged 
siblings, ?f+ and ?f-, all have parity -1. Then it was very strange to find that a particle 
called the kaon, K +, decayed to both two pions and three pions. People thought for a while 
that the kaon was two particles, the 8+ (with parity +1, which decayed to two pions) and 
the T+ (with parity -1, which decayed to three pions). Lee and Yang finally figured out, in 
1956, that these were the same particle, and that paIity was not conserved in kaon decays. 
For vector fields, P acts as it does on 4-vectors. However, for the free vector theory to 
be invariant, we only require that 
P: 
Vo(t, x) ----t ±Vo(t, -x), 
~(t, x) ----t =FVi(t, -x). 
(11.61)

'fhe .notation j thal j r p : \1;

f P : V. -4 \Ii" we all it" a p eudovector, with parity + 1. For example, the p meson is a 
r ector and the a} me on i a pseucl vector. You have already seen pseudo vectors in three 
~inlen ion : the electric field is .a v~ctor. that flips sign under parity, while the magnetic 
field is a pseudovecLOr that r mam IIwarrant under parity. 
Ma less vectors such as tbe photon have to have parity - 1. To see this, just look at the 
coupling to a charged scalar. Under parity we would like 
(11.62) 
which is only possible if AI-' transforms like 8w That is, AI-' is a vector: 
P: 
Ao(t, x) ~ Ao(t, -x), 
(11.63) 
11.5.2 Spinors 
Now let us turn to spinors. In the Lorentz group, P commutes with the rotations. Thus, 
p does not change the spin of a state embedded in a vector field. This should be true for 
spinors too. For massless spinors, recall that left- and right-handed spinors are eigenstates 
of the helicity operator, which projects spin onto the momentum axis: 
(11.64) 
Since parity commutes with spin, 5, and energy but flips the momentum, it will take left-
handed spinors to right-handed spinors. That is, it will map (~, 0) representations to (0, ~). 
Therefore, P cannot be appended to either of the spin-~ irreducible representations alone. 
For Dirac spinors, which comprise left- and right-handed spinors, we can see that parity 
just swaps left and right, keeping the spin invariant. In the Weyl basis, this transformation 
can be written in the simple form 
P: 'l/J ~ 'Yo'l/J, 
(11.65) 
There is in principle a phase ambiguity here, as for charged scalars. But, as in that case, we 
can use invariance under global phase rotations, associated with charge conservation, to 
simply choose this phase to be 1, as we have done here. Despite this phase, a chiral theory 
(one with no symmetry under L f-7 R), such as the theory of weak interactions, cannot be 
invatiant under parity. 
Note that 
P : 
i[;'l/J(t, x) ~ 'l/J t 'Yo'Yo'Yo'l/J(t, - x) = i[;'l/J( t, -x), 
P: 
i[;'YI-''l/J (t, x) ...... 'l/J t 'Yo'Yo'YI-''Yo'l/J(t, - x) = i[;'Y Z 1/)(t, -x). 
Recalling that 'Y6 = 'Yo and 'Yt = - 'Yi, we see that 
P: 
i[;'Yo'l/J(t, x) ~ i[;'Yo'l/J(t, -x),

The currents contracted with Ai" in these terms are known as the vector current, Jf; "" 
1j;,i"'IjJ, and the axial vector current, J~ = 1j;,i",5'IjJ. These currents playa crucial role in 
the theory of weak interactions, which involves Jf; -
J~, or the V - A current. 
11.6 Time reversal 
Finally, let us turn to the most confusing of the discrete symmetries, time reversal. As a 
Lorentz transformation, 
T: 
(t,x) ---+ (-t,x). 
(11.72) 
We are going to need a transformation of our spinor fields, 'IjJ, such that (at least) the kinetic 
Lagrangian is invariant. To do this, we need 1j;,i"'IjJ to transform as a 4-vector under T, so 
that i1j;f/J'IjJ(t, x) ---+ i1j;f/J'IjJ( -t, x) and the action will be invariant. In particular, we need the 
O-component, 1j;,0'IjJ ---+ _1j;,0'IjJ, which implies 'IjJ t 'IjJ ---+ -'IjJ t 'IjJ. But this last form of the 
requirement is very odd - it says we need to tum a positive definite quantity into a negative 
definite quantity. This is impossible for any linear transformation 'IjJ ---+ f'IjJ. Thus, we need 
to think harder. 
We will discuss two possibilities. One we will call "simple T," and denote T. It is the 
obvious parallel to parity. The other is the T symmetry, which is normally what is meant 
by T in the literature. This second T was invented by Wigner in 1932 and requires T to 
take i ---+ -i in the whole Lagrangian in addition to acting on fields. While the simple T 
is the more natural generalization of the action of T on 4-vectors, it is also kind of trivial. 
Wigner's T has important physical implications. 
11.6.1 The simple T 
Before doing anything drastic, the simplest thing besides T : 'IjJ ---+ f'IjJ would be T : 'IjJ ---+ 
f'IjJ*, as with charge conjugation. We will call this transformation T to distinguish it from 
what is conventionally called T in the literature. So, 
(11.73) 
That T should take particles to antiparticles is also understandable from the picture of 
antiparticles as particles moving backwards in time. 

11.6 Time reversal

Then, 
¢t¢ -+ 7PTrtr7P* = r~j3rj3,7Pa7P; = -7P;(r~j3rj3lf 7Pa = -7Pt(rtr)T 7P, 
(11.74) 
"'e need rtr = 11, which says that r is a unitary matrix. That is fine. But we also need 
SO" 
-
~1i7P and the mass term 7P7P to be preserved. For the mass term, 
-
T 
" 
-
T 
7P7P ---+ 7P rll'or7P* = -?jJ(rtl'orl'o) 7P 
(11.75) 
This equals if;7P only if {r, I'D} = O. Next, 
if;l'i7P ---+ 7PTrt 1'0I'ir 7P* = -if;(rt 1'0l'irl'of 7P = -if;(rt I'irf 7P, 
(11.76) 
which should be equal to $l'i7P for i = 1,2,3. So I'ir + rl'T = 0, which implies [r, I'll = 
0, [r,1'3] = 0 and {r, 1'2} = O. The unique (up to a constant) matrix that commutes with 
11 and ~(3 and anticommutes with 1'2 and 1'0 is r = 1'01'2. Thus, 
Note that this is very similar to P . C. On vectors, we should have 
T: 
Ao(t, x) ---+ -Ao( -t, x), 
so that the interaction if;$7P in the action is invariant. 
Now consider the action of C . P . T. This sends 
and so 
CPT: 
7P(t, x) ---+ -i')'2 ho bOI'27P*]) * ( -t, -x) = -i7P( -t, -x) 
CPT: 
if;(t, x)')'/J>7P(t, x) ---+ if; ( -t, -x)')'/J>7P( -t, -x), 
CPT: 
A/J>(t, x) ---+ A/J>( -t, -x). 
(11.77) 
(11.78) 
(11.79) 
(11.80) 
(11.81) 
CPT also sends o/J> ---+ -ow Thus, if;7P, iif;l'/J>o/J>7P and if;A/J>I'/J>7P are all invariant in the 
action. 
This time reversal is essentially defined to be T rv (CP)-l, which makes CPT invari-
ance trivial. The actual CPT theorem concerns a different T symmetry, which we will now 
discuss. 
11.6.2 Wigner's T (i.e. what is normally called T) 
What is normally called time reversal is a symmetry T that was described in a 1932 
paper by Wigner, and shown to be an explanation of Kramer's degeneracy. To understand 
Kramer's degeneracy, consider the Schrodinger equation, 
iOt7P(t, x) = H7P(t, x), 
(1l.82) 
199 

200 
Spinor solutions and CPT 
...... ------------------------------------------
2 
where, for simplicity, let us say H = ~ + V(x), which is real and time independent. If 
we take the complex conjugate of this equation and also t ----7 -t, we find 
i(:3(l/J* (-t, x) = H 'IjJ* (-t, x). 
(11.83) 
Thus, 'IjJ'(t,x) = 'IjJ*(- t,x) is another solution to the Schrodinger equation. If'IjJ is an 
energy eigenstate, then as long as 'IjJ ic ~'IjJ* for any complex number ~, 'IjJ' will be another 
state with the same energy. This doubling of states at each energy is known as Kramer's 
degeneracy. In particular, for the hydrogen atom, 'ljJnlmUl) = Rn(r)Yim(e, ¢) are the 
energy eigenstates, so Kramer's degeneracy says that the states with m and -m will 
be degenerate (which they are). The importance of this theorem is that it also holds for 
more complicated systems, and for systems in external electric fields, for which the exact 
eigenstates may not be known. 
As we will soon see, this mapping, 'IjJ(t, x) ----7 'IjJ*( -t, x), sends particles to particles (not 
antiparticles), unlike the simple T operator above. It has a nice interpretation: Suppose you 
made a movie of some physics process, then watched the movie backwards; time reversal 
implies you should not be able to tell which was "play" and which was "reverse." 
The trick to Wigner's T is that we had to complex conjugate and then take 'IjJ' = 'IjJ*. 
This means in particular that the i in the Schrodinger equation goes to -i as well as the 
field transforming. This is the key to finding a way out of the problem that 'IjJ t 'IjJ needed to 
flip sign under T, which we discussed at the beginning of the section. The kinetic term for 
'IjJ is i"jj,,(o 80'IjJ; so if i ----7 - i then, since 80 ----7 -80, 'IjJ t 'IjJ can be invariant. Thus we need 
T: 
i ----7 - i . 
(11.84) 
This makes T an anti-linear operator. What that means is that if we write any object on 
which T acts as a real plus an imaginary part 'IjJ = 'ljJ1 + i'IjJ2, with 'ljJ1 and 'ljJ2 real, then 
T('ljJ1 + i'IjJ2) = T'ljJ1 - iT'ljJ2. 
Since T changes all the factors of i in the Lagrangian to -i, it also affects the ,,(-matrices. 
In the Weyl basis, only "(2 is imaginary, so 
T: 
"(0, 1,3 ----7 "(0,1,3, 
"(2 ----7 -"(2. 
( 11.85) 
For a real spinor, T is simply linear, so we can write its action as 
T: 
'IjJ(t, x) ----7 f 'IjJ( - t, if), 
(11.86) 
with f a Dirac matrix. Then, for ii/yyI"81"'IjJ to be invariant, we need "jj,,(0'IjJ to be invariant 
and ~"(i'IjJ ----7 - ;hi'IjJ. Thus, 
[r,"(o] = {r,"(l} = [r,"(2] = {r'''(3} = O. 
(11.87) 
The only element of the Dirac algebra that satisfies these constraints is r = "(1"(3 , up to a 
constant. Thus, we take 
T: 
1 
o 
o 
-1 
J~(-t,X).

It is straightforward to check now that the Dirac Lagrangian is invariant under T. 
Next, consider the combined operation of CPT. This sends particles into antiparticles 
moving as if you watched them in reverse in a mirror. On Dirac spinors, it acts as 
(11.90) 
It also sends AIL (x) ---+ AIL ( -x), ¢ ---+ ¢* (-x) and of course i ---+ -i. 
You can check (Problem 11.7) that any terms you could possibly write down, for 
example, 
(11.91) 
and so on, are all CPT invariant. The CPT theorem says that this is a consequence of 
Lorentz invariance and unitarity. A rigorous mathematical proof of the CPT theorem can 
be found in [Streater and Wightman, 1989]. It is not hard to check that any term you 
could write down in a local Lagrangian is CPT invariant; however, the rigorous proof does 
require a Lagrangian description. Some examples of how unitarity can be used without a 
Lagrangian are given in Chapter 24.

where VL is a left-handed (~, 0) two-component Weyl spinor and VR is a right-
handed (0, ~) Weyl spinor. Note that there are two mass terms: a Dirac mass 
m, as for the electron, and a Majorana mass, M. 
(b) We want to figure out what the mass eigenstates are, but as written the 
Lagrangian is mixing everything up. First, show that XL == ia2v1 transforms 
as a left-handed spinor under the Lorentz group, so that it can mix with VL. 
Then rewrite the mass terms in terms of VL and XL. 
(c) Next, rewrite the Lagrangian in terms of a doublet e == (v L, XL). This is not a 
Dirac spinor, but a doublet of left-handed Weyl spinors. Using Lkin, show that 
this doublet satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation. What are the mass eigenstates 
for the neutrinos? How many particles are there? 
(d) Suppose M » m. For example, M = 10lD GeV and m = 100 GeV What are 
the masses of the physical particles? The fact that as M goes up, the physical 
masses go down, inspired the name see-saw mechanism for this neutrino mass 
arrangement. What other choice of M and m would give the same spectrum of 
observed particles (i.e. particles less than rv 1 Te V)? 
(e) The left-handed neutrino couples to the Z boson and also to the electron 
through the W boson. The W boson also couples the neutron and proton. The 
relevant part for the weak-force Lagrangian is 
Using these interactions, draw a Feynman diagram for neutrinoless double {3-
decay, in which two neutrons decay to two protons and two electrons.

arrows on the e and v lines to respect lepton number flow. Show that you 
cannot connect the arrows on your diagram without violating lepton number. 
Does this imply that neutrinoless double (3-decay can tell if the neutrino has a 
Majorana mass? 
11.10 In Section lOA, we showed that the electron has a magnetic dipole moment, 
of order /-tE = -2 
e 
, by squaring the Dirac equation. An additional magnetic 
me 
moment could come from an interaction of the form B = iFJ1,vif bJ1, , 1V]7,b in the 
Lagrangian. An electric dipole moment (EDM) corresponds to a term of the form 
E = FJ1,v~1d1J1,,1V]7,b. 
(a) Expand the contribution of the electric dipole term to the Dirac equation 
in terms of electric and magnetic fields to show that it does in fact give

Spinor solutions and CPT

(c) It turns out that C, P and T are all separately violated in the Standard MOdel 
even though they are preserved in QED (and QeD). P is violated by the Weak 
interactions, but T (and CP) is only very weakly violated. Thus we expect 
unless there is a new source of C P violation beyond the Standard Model, th~ 
electron, the neutron, the proton, the deuteron etc., all should have unmeasUr_ 
ably small (but non-zero) EDMs. Why is it OK for a molecule (such as H20) 
or a battery to have an EDM but not the neutron (which is made up of quarks 
with different charges)?

lent to the ralement that the creation and annihilalion p rators for integer 'pin panicle 
satiSfy canonical commutation relations, while creation and annihilation operators for half-
integer spin particles satisfy canonical anticommutation relations. Particles quantized with 
canonical commutation relations are called bosons, and satisfy Bose-Einstein statistics, 
and particles quantized with canonical anticommutation relations are called fermions, and 
satisfy Fermi-Dirac statistics. 
The simplest way to see the connection between spin and statistics, mentioned in Chap-
ter 10, is as follows. One way to interchange two particles is to rotate them around their 
midpoint by 7[. For a particle of spin s, this rotation will introduce a phase factor of ei7rs . 
Thus, a two-particle state with identical particles both of spin s will pick up a factor of 
e21ris . For s a half-integer, this will give a factor of -1; for s an integer, it will give a factor 
of +1. This argument is made more precise in Section 12.2. 
Traditionally, the spin-statistics theorem is derived by pointing out that things go 
terribly awry if the wrong statistics are applied. For example, the spin-statistics the-
orem follows from Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix. Since the S-matrix is con-
structed from Lorentz-covariant fields, Lorentz invmiance is almost obvious. The catch 
is that the S-matrix is defined in terms of a time-ordered product of fields S 
rv T 
{¢l(Xl)'" ¢n(xn)}. If you choose commutation relations for particles of half-integer 
spin, this time-ordered product will not be Lorentz invariant. If you choose anticommuta-
tion relations, it will be. The relevant calculations m'e given in Section 12.4. An important 
result of this section is the propagator for a Dirac spinor. 
Another critelion that can be used to prove the spin-statistics theorem is that the total 
energy of a system should be bounded from below. When applied to free particles, we 
call this the stability requirement (instabilities due to interactions are a different story; 
see, for example, Chapter 28). For free particles, if the wrong statistics are used, antipar-
ticles will have arbitrmily negative energy. This would allow kinematical processes, such 
as an electron decaying into a muon, e-
----) p,- vev/-L' which is normally forbidden by 
energy onservation (not momentum con ervation). We take it f r granted that light par-
tiCles cannot decay t · heavier partiel ,but thi. i actually a non-trivial con equence of 
the pin-statl tic theorem. [n studying the lability requirement ill Section 12.5, we will 
investigate the Hamiltonian and energy-momentum tensor, which provide more generally 
Useful results. 
205 

206 
Spin and statistics 
~~----~ ----------------------------------------------------------~ 
One does not have to postulate stability for free particles, since it follows frollJ. 
spin-statistics, which follows from Lorentz invariance. However, requiring stability is a 
necessary and sufficient condition for the spin-statistics theorem. This is important in con_ 
texts such as condensed matter systems in which Lorentz invariance is irrelevant. There 
you could study representations of whatever the appropriate group is, say the Galilea~ 
group, and you would still find spinors, but you would not be interested in the S-matrix 
or causality. In this case, spinors would still have to be fermions to ensure stability of the 
system you are studying. 
There are other ways to see the connection between spin and statistics. A very impor_ 
tant requirement historically was that operators corresponding to observables that are 
constructed out of fields should commute at spacelike separation: 
[Ol(X), 02(Y)] = 0, 
(x - y)2 < 0. 
(12.1) 
We call this the causality criterion. Note that it is pretty crazy to imagine that a theory 
which involves generally smooth functions could produce objects that vanish in a com-
pact region but do not vanish everywhere. This would be mathematically impossible if 
[0 1 (x), O2 (y)] were an analytic function of x and y. Quantum field theory can get away 
with this because operator products give distributions, not functions. In fact, as we will 
show in Section 12.6, they give distributions with precisely the property of Eq. (12.1). 
The causality criterion was first proposed by Pauli in his seminal paper on spin-
statistics from 1940 [Pauli, 1940]. The idea behind this requirement comes from quantum 
mechanics: When two operators commute, they are simultaneously observable; they can-
not influence each other. If they could influence each other at spacelike separations, one 
could use them to communicate faster than the speed of light. This is a weaker requirement 
than Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix. Unfortunately, causality can only be used to prove 
that integer spin particles commute, but not that half-integer spin particles anticommute. 
The reason is that observables are bilinear in spinors, and hence have integer spin (can you 
think of an observable linear in a spinor?). 
Causality actually follows directly from Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix: time order-
ing is only Lorentz invariant for timelike separations. That is, the inequality ti < tj is 
Lorentz invariant as long as xr -x'j is timelike. If two points are spacelike separated, then 
one can boost to a frame where tj < ti. Thus, for spacelike separation, time ordering of 
a pair of fields is an ambiguous operation unless the fields commute. So causality follows 
from Lorentz invariance ofthe S-matrix. The converse is not true: Eq. (12.1) is a necessary 
condition, but not sufficient, for Lorentz invariance of the S -matrix. 
12.1 Identical particles 
To talk about spin-statistics, we first need to talk about identical particles. The universe is 
full of many types of particles: photons, electrons, muons, quarks, etc. Each particle has 
a momentum, Pi, a spin, Si, and a bunch of additional quantum numbers, ni, which say

(sIPInl" 'Is~p;n~ . . . ) = II On in:Os i s ~ 2wi(27f)303(pi - p) 
(12.3) 
We could have also acted with the creation operators in a different order, giving 
(12.4) 
Since the particles are identical, this must be the same physical state, so it can only differ 
by normalization. Since we have fixed the normalization, it can only differ by a phase: 
(12.5) 
where a = ei 4> for some real 4;. 
What can a depend on? Since it is just a number, it cannot depend on the momenta Pi 
or the spins Si, as there are no non-trivial one-dimensional representations of the (proper) 
Lorentz group. It could possibly depend on a Lorentz-invariant characterization of the path 
by which the particles are interchanged. However, in 3 + 1 dimensions, there are no such 
invariants (we derive this in the next section). Thus, a can only depend on n, the species 
of particle. So let us write a = an. 
Now we can swap the particles back, giving 
(12.6) 
Thus an = ± l. We call an = 1 bosons, which we say satisfy Bose-Einstein statistics, 
and we call an = -1 fermions, which we say satisfy Fermi-Dirac statistics. So every 
particle is either a fermion or a boson. The boson case implies that

Also, since (PI lth) = 2Wl (27f) 3 03 (PI - P2), we can use the same argument to show that

The physics of fermions is very different from the physics of bosons. With bosons, sUch 
as the photon, we can have multiple particles of the same momentum in the same state. 
In fact, thinking about multi-particle excitations in Chapter I led to the connection with 
the simple harmonic oscillator and second quantization in Chapter 2. Now consider What 
happens if we try to construct a state with two identical fermionic particles with the sarne 
momenta (a two-particle state). We find

(12.12) 
This is the Fermi exclusion principle, and it follows directly from the anticommutation 
relations. 
By the way, that identical particles must exist is an automatic consequence of using cre-
ation and annihilation operators in quantum field theory. You might wonder why we have to 
consider states produced with creation operators at all. If we demand that all operators are 
constructed out of creation and annihilation operators we are guaranteed that the cluster 
decomposition principle holds. The cluster decomposition principle requires that When 
you separate two measurements asymptotically far apart, they cannot influence each other. 
Technically, it says that the S-matrix should factorize into clusters of interactions. Many 
other methods for calculating S-matrix elements have been considered over the years, but 
the quantum field theory approach, based on creation and annihilation operators, remains 
the most efficient way to guarantee cluster decomposition. 
12.2 Spin-statistics from path dependence 
Rather than simply relating two states at a~ 10) and a~alI0), we can consider actually inter-
changing the particles physically. This will let us connect statistics directly to spin and 
representations of the Lorentz group. Suppose we have two particles at positions Xl and 
X2 at time t = O. Then, at some later time, we find them also at Xl and X2. Since they are 
identical, we could have had the particle at Xl move back to Xl and the particle at X2 move 
back to X2, or the particles could have switched places. We could also have had the par-
ticles spin around each other many times. There is a well-defined way to characterize the 
transformation, by the angle ¢ by which one particle rotated around the other. This angle 
is frame independent and a topological property associated with the path. In Figure 12.1, 
pictures of these exchanges are shown. 
In general, it is possible for the two-particle state to pick up a phase proportional to this 
angle ¢, as in Eq. (12.5). So we can define an operator S that switches the particles. Then 
the most general possibility for what would happen when we switch the particles is that

,he angle that one particle travels around another before coming back to its own or the 
other's position is a Lorentz-invariant characterization of the path. 
for some number K characteristic of the particle type. 
Now, with three spatial dimensions, the angle ¢ can only be defined up to 2n. For exam-
ple, tbe diagram in (he lhird 'figure can be unwrapped by pulling the X2 loop out of the 
page 0 thal the particles do not go arOllnd each other. Tints, the aCtion of S on the states is

implies that, for an interchange with ¢ = n, we can only have 
(12.14) 
So only fermionic and bosonic statistics are possible. In other words, in three dimensions, 
there is no way to characterize the path other than that the particles were swapped (¢ = n) 
or not (¢ = 0). 
Thus, there are only two possibilities, given by the first two paths in Figure 12.1. Con-
sider the second path. In a free-field theory, we can actually perform the exchange by 
acting with Poincare generators on the fields. One way would be to translate by the dis-
tance between Xl and X2, then to rotate the whole system by n so that particle 2 is back at 
Xl> as shown in Figure 12.2. 
Under the translation, nothing interesting happens. Under the rotation, what happens 
depends on the spin. For scalars, there is no spin, so our transformation takes 
(12.15) 
On the other hand, for spinors there is a non-trivial transformation. In fact, we worked it 
out explicitly in Section 10.5: for Dirac spinors, a rotation by an angle ez is represented by

Particles' positions can be interchanged by first translating the pair by X2 -
Xl, then 
rotating the pair around X2. Alternatively, we could have just rotated the two particles 
arOUnd their midpoint.

Spin and statistics 
....... -------------------------------------------------
Eq. (10.118): 
(12.16) 
which for {}z = n is the matrix with i and -i in the diagonal. So, suppose the particles 
were both spin out-of-the page (spin into-the-page is the same, but for spins in the x Or y 
direction, this manipulation will not take the particles back to themselves and one needs to 
consider a different route). Then, 
(12.17) 
So the two-particle state with identical spins has 
(12.18) 
which is to say that the spinors pick up a minus sign under the interchange. 
This derivation works for particles of any half-integer or integer spin. The only thing 
we need is that under a 2n rotation half-integer spin particles go to minus themselves, 
while integer spin particles go to themselves. This is practically the definition of spin. This 
derivation is appealing because it is directly related to spinors transforming in represen-
tations of the universal cover of the Lorentz group, SL(2, C), which is simply connected, 
while the Lorentz group itself is doubly connected. If you like this argument, then you can 
skip the rest of this chapter (except for the calculation of the Feynman propagator for Dirac 
spinors, which we will use later). 
In 2 + 1 dimensions, the situation is more interesting. There, paths with ¢ and ¢ + 21fn 
are distinguishable - we cannot unwrap the third path in Figure 12.1 into the first path 
anymore by pulling it out of the page. So in this case, 
(12.19) 
and K, can be an arbitrary number. Particles with K, ~ Z are called anyons. 
We can understand anyons also from the representations of the 3D Lorentz group, 
SO(2, 1). Recall that for four dimensions the little group of the Poincare group, which 
determined its irreducible representations, was SO(3) (for the massive case). For 80(3), 
we found that there were paths through the group, from 11 to 11, that were not smoothly 
deformable to the trivial path. For example, rotations by 2n around any axis have this 
property. However, any 4n rotation can be deformed to the trivial path. In other words, the 
fundamental group of 80(3) is Z2. With two spatial dimensions, the little group is 80(2).

12.3 Quantizing spinors 
The remaining connections between spin and statistics we want to explore involve quantum 
fields. So the first thing we must do is quantize our spinors. This is straightforward, up to 
the statistics issue. 
Recall that for a complex scalar the field we had

and the equations of motion are 
(if/J -

f-
7f;( -i f/J -
e~ - m) = O. 
(12.22) 
(12.23) 
(12.24) 
In Section 11.2, we saw that the free-field solutions can written in terms of constant two-
component spinors (s and 7)s, with s = 1,2 in the concise notation: 
us(p) = ( ~P'~~s ), vs(p) = ( 
V:'(J~s ).

are the solutions to the Dirac equation with arbitrary momentum describing electrons and 
positrons respectively. 
Thus, we take

where, as always, the energy is positive and determined by the 3-momentum wp

J f}2 + m 2 . So 'ljJ (x) annihilates incoming electrons and if; (x) annihilates incoming 
positrons. The full Feynman rules for QED will be derived in the next chapter. 
The next three sections will be devoted to deriving the spin-statistics theorem in three 
different ways. 
12.4 Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix 
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix is a 
sufficient condition for the spin-statistics theorem. The S-matrix is constructed from time_ 
ordered products, with the simplest non-trivial time-ordered product being the Feynman 
propagator. 
Time ordering must be defined for bosons and fermions. Fermionic creation and 
annihilation operators anticommute at generic momenta and times. Therefore, 
(12.28) 
Thus we cannot just define time ordering as "take all the operators and put them in time 
order," or else this equation would imply the time-ordered product must vanish. So we 
have to define time ordering for fermions by anticommuting the operators past each other, 
keeping track of minus signs. Thus, for generic functions 'ljJ(x) of fermionic creation and 
annihilation operators, the only consistent definition of time ordering is 
T {'ljJ(x)X(y)} = 'ljJ(x)X(y)8(xo - Yo) - X(y)'ljJ(x)8(yo - xo). 
(12.29) 
Now we can consider time-ordered products of fermionic fields. 
12.4.1 Spin 0

field and its conjugate is

and similarly, 
(12.31) 
Combining these equations we get 

12.4 Lorentz invariance of the s-matrix 
(12.33)

(12.35) 
where Po == W is an integration variable. This is a beautiful manifestly Lorentz-invariant 
expression. 
If we instead take anticommutation relations, we would need to use anti-time ordering. 
Then, 
This is not Lorentz invariant. Therefore the S-matrix for spin-O particles is Lorentz 
invariant if and only if they are bosons. 
12.4.2 Spinors 
Now let us repeat the calculation with spinors. We start the same way:

Note that 'IjJ(O);j)(x) refers to a matrix in spin or space: (OI'IjJ(O)Q~,a(x)IO) '" (u~)a(U~)i3. 
Now we sum over polarizations using the outer products from Eqs. (11.29) and (11.30):

L U 8 (P)U 8 (p) = P + m, L v8 (p)V S (p) = P - m,

giving 
(12.39) 
This is also a matrix in spinor space: {;(x)'IjJ(O) in this expression means {;Q(x)'IjJ,a(O). 
Note that this convention contrasts with when we write Lagrangian terms such as 
{;'IjJ = {;Q(x)'ljJQ(x) = TI'({;Q(x)'IjJ,a(x)), which have no free indices. Whether there is 
a contraction of spinor indices will be clear from context or explicitly indicated. 
In summary, we have found 
(OI'IjJ(O){;(x)IO) = (-iqj+m) J

(OI{;(x)'IjJ(O)IO) = -(-iqj+m) J

(12.42) 
These equations are independent of whether commutation or anticommutation relations are 
assumed. 
Now let us first assume commutation relations. Then the time-ordered product is 
defined in the usual way: T {'IjJ(O)~(x)}= 'IjJ(0)~(x)8( - t) + ~(x )'IjJ(0)8(t). Then we get, 
recycling results from Section 12.4.1,

12.5 Stability 
The Feynman propagator for Dirac spinors is more conventionally written as 
(12.45) 
This is an extremely important result, used in practically every calculation in QED. 
Let us trace back to what happened. We found for a scalar:

(12.48) 
(12.49) 
Now we can see that the problem is that p is odd under the rotation that takes p ----7 -p, so 
that an extra -1 is generated when we try to combine the time-ordered sum for the fermion. 
Rotating p ----7 -p is a rotation by 7r. We saw that this gives a factor of i in the fermion case. 
So here we have two fermions, and we get a -1. So it is directly related to the spin ~. This 
will happen for any half-integer spin, which gets an extra -1 in the rotation. 
Another way to look at it is that the p factor comes from the polarization sum, which 
in tum comes from the requirement that the free solutions satisfy the equations of motion, 
pUs(p) = pVs(p) = O. In fact, we can now see directly that the same problem will hap-
pen for any particle of half-integer spin. A particle of spin n + ~ for integer n will have 
a field with n vector indices and a spinor index, WMl ' ''Mn' So the corresponding polar-
ization sum must have a factor of 1M and the only thing around to contract 1M with is 
its momentum PM' Thus, we always get a p, plus possibly additional factors of p~, and 
the time-ordered product can never be Lorentz invariant unless the fields anticommute. 
These are fermions. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. In contrast, for integer spin there 
can only be an even number of P~ in the polarization sum. So these fields must commute to 
have Lorentz-invariant time-ordered products. These are bosons. They obey Bose-Einstein 
statistics. 
12.5 Stability 
One does not have to deal with time-ordered products to see the consequences of wrongly 
chosen statistics. In fact, a universe in which spinors commute would have disastrous con-
sequences - particles with finite momentum could have negative energy. The particles

would still be on-shell, E2 = r + m 2 , so this is not a problem with Lorentz invariance, 
but it would mean that all kinds of things such as p+ ---7 p+ e+ e- would not be forbidden. 
Recall from Eq. (8.13) that the energy density is given by the OO-component of the 
energy-momentum tensor: 
"" ere . 
E = Too = L.J - . ¢n - 'c. 
n O¢n 
(12.50) 
We derived this equation by identifying the energy-momentum tensor as the Noether CUr-
rent associated with space-time translations. We have already used this general definition 
of the energy density to constrain theories with integer spin particles in Chapter 8. Here, We 
will see how spin-statistics follows from having a positive-definite energy density. More 
precisely, we need the total energy given by 
(12.51) 
to be bounded from below, since a constant shift has no physical consequences. 
12.5.1 Free scalar fields 
For a free complex scalar field, 
(12.52) 
the energy-momentum tensor is, starting from Eq. (3.35), 
o,c 
~v = ~ 
O(0/l>¢n) ov¢n = -g/l>v'c 
= 0/l>¢*ov¢ + o/l>¢ov¢* - g/l>V [10/l>¢1 2 -
m 21¢12] . 
(12.53) 
The energy density is 
(12.54) 
Classically, this would obviously be positive definite. It is not quite that simple in the 
quantum theory. 
Using the free scalar fields, Eq. (12.20), the total energy is

(12.55) 
Doing the x integral first turns the phases into o-functions. Using w~ = r + m 2 then 
reduces the whole thing to

(with commutators). 
(12.57) 
This Vt'o term is an infinite contribution to the energy, which is independent of what state 
the system is in. It is just the zero-point energy for the sum of the particles and antipar-
ticles in the Hilbert space (each of which gives ~). Just as in classical mechanics, only 
differences in energy can have measurable effects (see Chapter 15). The important point 
for stability is that the energy difference between two states is 
6.E = J 
(~~3 wp (6.# particles + 6.# antiparticles) . 
(12.58) 
States with more particles (or antiparticles) have more energy. 
Now, suppose we had used anticommutation relations instead, then we would have had

which would mean 
6.E = J 
(~:~3 wp (6.# particles - 6.# antiparticles) . 
(12.60) 
In particular, the energy can be lowered by producing antiparticles! Thus, the vacuum could 
spontaneously decay into particle-antiparticle pairs. Particles could spontaneously decay 
into particles and antiparticles. Nothing would be stable - this would be a huge disaster. 
12.5.2 Free fermions 
Now we will do the same computation for ferrnions. Here the Lagrangian is 
(12.61) 
and the energy-momentum tensor is 
(12.62) 
So the energy density is 
(12.63) 
Using the equations of motion, this simplifies to

Now if we have anticommutators, this is just 
E= L [/ (~:~3WP(a;ta;+b;tb;) - vt'o] 
(withanticommutators), 
(12.67) 
s 
which again counts the number ofpartic1es and antipaItic1es, weighted by the energy. Note 
that for fermions the zero-point energy is negative. 
If we had commutators instead, we would have 
E = L [/ (~:~3 wp(a;ta; - b;tb;) - vt'o] 
(with commutators), 
s 
(12.68) 
which would have an energy unbounded from below. 
So the stability requirement, that is, that the energy must grow whell(we add more 
particles or antiparticles, holds if and only if the spin-statistics theorem holds. Again, 
just postulating Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix implies spin-statistics, which implies 
stability. 
12.5.3 General spins 
The spinor calculation in this case was much easier than the scalar case. Neveltheless, we 
can track through and find that the terms that survived the scalar calculation came from 
(12.69) 
In contrast, the relevant terms for spin ~ were (using commutation relations)

uadratic. This in tum comes from the fact that U1 Lagrangian for the . calar ha two 
:e~YIl(iVe kinetic terms, while the pin r ha • . ingle derivatives. 
More generally, every imeg r spin particle will be embedded in a tensor 
(A. 11,1111 Z,'IICt' " .). The term quadrnlic in these field will have an even number of 
'ndiCes to contract, forcing an even number of derivatives in the kinetic term. fn con-
I "'5t every half-integer pin particle will be embedded in a pinal' fiell, with ten orindices

(1/1 X" 'hill," .). They mtl t b contracted wiu1 barred spinor ('If; XI' fitw ... ), which 
IIlln'fonn in complex conjugate representation of the Lorentz group. To contract the e, 
we must insert a "til matrix, which must be contracted with a single Ow Thus, all kinetic 
tenus for integer spin fields will have an even number of derivatives and kinetic terms 
for half-integer spin fields will have an odd number of derivatives. This will lead to the 
same minus signs in the derivation of the Hamiltonian. Thus, all integer (half-integer) spin 
particles must be bosons (fermions). 
12.6 Causality 
The other connection between spin and statistics that is often discussed comes from consid-
erations of causality. Causality is a reasonable physical requirement. The precise condition 
is that the commutator of observables should vanish outside the lightcone, that is, at 
spacelike separation. For spin 0, the field itself is observable, so we require 
[¢(x), ¢(y)] = 0, 
(x - y)2 < O. 
(12.71) 
What does this commutator have to do with physics? Remember, we are just doing quan-
tum mechanics here. So when two operators commute they are simultaneously observable. 
Another way to say this is that if the operators commute they are uncorrelated and cannot 
influence each other. So, if we measure the field (remember ¢ measures the field) at x = 0 
it should not influence the measurement at a distant point y at the same time. On the other 
hand, if we measure the field at t = 0 it might affect the field at a later time t at the same 
position x. This is a precise statement of causality. 
What we are going to show below is that [$",(x),'lj;/3(Y)] does not vanish outside the 
lightcone. This would imply that if we could measure 'lj; (x), then we would have a violation 
of causality. Unfortunately, spinors appear not to be observables. The only things we ever 
measure are numbers, which are constructed out of bilinears in spinors. Thus, the physical 
requirement is only that 
[-0(x)'l/J(x) , -0(y)'lj;(y)] = 0, 
(x - y? < O. 
(12.72) 
This condition will be guaranteed if either [-0", (x) , 'lj;,e(y)] = 0 or {-0", (x), 'lj;,e(y)} = 0 
Outside the lightcone. Thus, having the spinors anticommute (or commute) at spacelike 
separation would be a sufficient condition for causality, but it may not be necessary. In 
fact, one expects that perhaps the commutator of spinor bilinears will vanish outside the

(12.75) 
This integral is tricky. We have to be careful since we expect it to be something non-
analytic - that is the only way it can vanish everywhere outside the lightcorre, but not 
vanish inside the lightcone. 
The result is a function we call D (t, r). For m = 0 it is 
1 
D(t, r) = 47fr [o(r + t) - o(r - t)] , 
(12.76) 
which has support only on the lightcone. For m =/= 0, we can find an exact expression for 
D(t, r) in terms of the Bessel function JO(x): 
1 0 { Jo(mJt2 - r2), 
D(t r) = --

, 
47fr or 
~Jo(mJt2 _ r2), 
t > r, 
r > t > -r, 
t < -r. 
We see that D(t, r) has support only in the future and past lightcones. 
(12.77) 
More generally, D(t, f') is a Green's function for the Klein-Gordon equation with 
boundary conditions: 
(0 + m 2 )D(t, f') = 0, 
D(O, f') = 0, 
~ D(t f')1 
= -o(f') . 
ut 
t=o 
(12.78) 
D(t, f') satisfies 
D(t, f') = -D( -t, f') 
and 
D(t, f') = D(t, -f'). 
(12.79) 

12.6 Causality 
at is, it is odd under time reversal and even under parity. This can be seen from the 
Tb I.cit form, or from the boundary condition on the Green's function. So, with x - y ==

which vanishes outside the lightcone as desired. 
The vanishing of anticommutators of spinors outside the lightcone is a sufficient but not 
necessary condition for causality; see Problem 12.1. 
12.6.2 Higher spins 
For spin 0 and spin ~ we found 
[¢(X),¢(y)] = D(t,r), 
{¢(x),¢(y)} = D1(r,t), 
(12.90) 
['l/J(x),7/J(y)] = (ifftx+m)D1(t,r), 
{'l/J(x) ,7/J(y)} = (i$x+m)D(t,r), 
(12.91) 
Since D(t,r) vanishes outside of the lightcone, but Dl(t,r) does not, we concluded that 
we needed commutators for spin 0 and anticommutators for spin ~. The prefactors are just 
spin sums - recall that I:spins 'flu = (1 + m) for Dirac spinors and I:spins = 1 for a scalar. 
For higher spin fields, the canonical quantization will result in the same integrals, but with 
a different prefactor operator. 
For higher spin fields, we will get the appropriate polarization sum. For massive spin 1, 
we would get 
[AJ-'(x), A,,(y)] = (gJ-'v + ~2 01-'0,,) D(t, r), 
{AJ-'(x) , Av(Y)} = (gl-'V + ~2 01-'0,,) Dl (t r), 
and again we have to pick commutators. 
(12.92) 

Problems 
for higher spin fields there will be more derivativ s acting on either the function D or 
We can see whether D or Dl appears by a impJe symmetry argum nl (due to Pauli). 
g~~erve that under the combined time reversal and parity tran formation, PT, 
D(t,f')=-D(-t,-f') and 
D1(t,f') = Dl(-t,-f'). 
(12.93) 
ThiS can be seen at once from Eqs. (12.75) and (12.81). Also, the commutator [¢(x), ¢(Y)] 
. odd under x ~ Y and the anticommutator is even. Derivatives are odd. Therefore, 
IS 
[AJ-L" " J-L" (x), Av,,,.vn(Y)] = 1(D,9J-Lv' 0J-L0v)D(t,r), 
(12.94) 
{AJ-L''''J-Ln(x), Av,,,.vn(Y)} = 1(D,gJ-Lv,oJ-Lov)D1(t,r), 
(12.95) 
since there must be an even number of derivatives in the function 1 by Lorentz invariance. 
For half-integer spin, we will get an odd number of derivatives. In general, the quan-
tity [~J-L''' ' J-Ln (x), 'ljiv,.'' vn(Y)l does not have definite quantum number under PT, since 
the fields are complex. But if we combine with the interchange of ap ~ bp , charge 
conjugation, the CPT transformation properties determine that 
[~J-L' ''' J-Ln (x) , 'ljiVl'''Vn (y)] = 1(0, gJ-LV, oJ-L0v)/JD1(t, r), 
{ ~J-L''' ' J-Ln (x ), 'ljiv' ''' Vn(Y)} = 1(D,9J-Lv' 0J-L0v)/JD(t,r), 
(12.96) 
(12.97) 
showing that all integer spin fields must have commutation relations and all half-integer 
fields must have anticommutation relations. 
In summary, for integer spins, which can be observables, causality is consistent only with 
commutation relations. For half-integer spins, anti commutation relations are a sufficient 
condition for causality. This method does not show that anticommutation relations for half-
integer spins are a necessary condition for causality. 
Problems 
12.1 In a causal theory, commutators of observables should vanish outside the light-
cone, [¢(x), ¢(y)] = 0 for (x -
y)2 < O. For spinol's, we found that with 
anti commutation relations { ~ (x ) , 'lji(Y)} = 0 outside the lightcone. This implies 
that integer spin quantities constructed out of spinors are automatically causal, 
e.g. 
[~'lji(x ),~'lji(y)] = O. However, this is not a proof that spinors must anti-
commute. What would happen to [?,b'lji(x),?,b'lji(y)] outside the lightcone if we 
used commutation relations for spinors? For simplicity, you can just look at 
(01 [~'lji(x) ,~'lji (Y)]IO ).

Quantum electrodynamics 
Now we are ready to do calculations in QED. We have found that the Lagrangian for 
QED is 
L = -~F;w + iijJI/J'I/J - mijJ'I/J, 
(13.1) 
with DI"'I/J = 0l"'I/J + ieAI"'I/J. We have also introduced quantized Dirac fields: 
(13.2)

(p - m)uS(p) = u8 (p)(p - m) = 0, 
(p + m)vS(p) = vS(p)(l + m) = 0, 
which will simplify a number of calculations.

we see that the interaction is Lint = -e-/fryl-'1/JAw Since there is no factor of momentUll1, 
the Feynman rule is the same for any combination of incoming or outgoing fields (unlike 
in scalar QED): 
(13.22) 
The J1, on the "II-' will get contracted with the J1, of the photon, which will either be in the 
91-'v of the photon propagator (if the photon is internal) or the ci-' of a polarization vector (if 
the photon is external). 
The "II-' = "I~f3 as a matrix will always get sandwiched between spinors, as in 
U"II-'u = U"'''I~f3Uf3 
(13.23) 
for e-e- scattering, or V"II-'u for e+ e- annihilation, etc. The barred spinor always goes on 
the left, since the interaction is 1jAI-'''II-'1/J. If there is an internal fermion line between the 
ends, the fermion propagator goes between the end spinors: 
.. 
P2 
(13.24) 
where the photon momenta are qi = p~ - pi and q~ = pj -
p~. In this example, the three 
"I-matrices get multiplied and then sandwiched between the spinors. To see explicitly what 
is a matrix and what is a vector, we can add in the spinor indices:

If we tie the ends of the diagram above together we get a loop: 
(13.26) 
For fermion loops we use the same convention as for scalar loops that the loop momentum 
goes in the direction of the particle-flow arrow. In the loop, since any possible interme-
diate states are allowed, we must integrate over the momenta of the virtual spinors as 
well as sum over their possible spins. The Ul)U", in Eq. (13.25) then gets replaced by a 
propagator that sums over all possible spins. This is done automatically since the numera-
tor of the propagator is (P2 + m)8", = 2:8 u;5U~. We also must integrate over all possible 
momenta constrained by momentum conservation at each vertex. So the loop in Eq. (13.26) 
evaluates to

wbere the trace is a trace of spinor indices. Computing Feynman diagrams in QED will 
often involve taking the trace of products of I -matrices. 
A useful general rule is that the spinor matrices are always multiplied together in the 
direction opposite to the particle-flow alTOW, which allows us to read off Eqs. (13.24) and 
(13.28) easily from the cOlTesponding diagrams. 
13.1.1 Signs 
Recall from Eq. (12.29) that spinors anticommute within a time-ordered product: 
T {- .. 'I/J(x)'I/J(y)··· } = -T { ... 'I/J(y)'I/J(x) , .. }. 
(13.29) 
Minus signs coming from such anticommutations appear in the Feynman rules. It is easiest 
to see when they should appear by example. 
Consider M011er scattering (e-e-
---+ e-e-) at tree-level. There are two Feynman 
diagrams, for the t-channel (in Feynman gauge): 
. Xl 
P3 
zMt = 
P2 
P4 
(13.30) 
and the u-channel: 
iMu = 
(13.31) 
The question is: What sign should each diagram have? 

228 
Quantum electrodynamics 
-------------------------------------------------------~ 
To find out, recall that these Feynman diagrams represent S-matrix elements. By the 
LSZ reduction theorem, they represent contributions to the Fourier transform of the Green's 
function: 
(13.32) 
with external propagators removed and external spinors added. The first non-zero Contri_ 
bution to this Green's function in perturbation theory comes at order e2 in an expansion of 
free fields: 
G4 = (-ie)2 J 
d4x J 
d4y 
x (OIT { '!f;( X l )1,b( X3)'!f;( X2)1,b( X4) ( 1,b( X )4i( X )'!f;( X)) ( 1,b(y )4i(y )'!f;(y)) } 10), 
(13.33) 
where the big C .. ) indicate that the spinors inside are contracted. More explicitly, we can 
write 
G4(XI, X2, X3, X4) = ( - ie)2,:;dj21~3f34 J 
d4x J 
d4y 
x (OIT{ '!f;aJXd1,ba3(X3)'!f;a2(X2)1,ba4(X4) 
x 1ff31(x)A/-L(x)'!f;f32(X)1ff33(y)AV(Y)~f3.(Y) }IO). 
(13.34) 
In this form, we can anticommute the spinors within the time ordering before performing 
any contractions. 
To get Feynman diagrams out of this Green's function, we have to perform contractions, 
which means creating fields from the vacuum and then annihilating them. To be absolutely 
certain about the sign coming from the contraction, it is easiest to anticommute the fields 
so that the fields that annihilate spinors are right next to the fields that create them. For the 
t-channel diagram, the top electron line is created by 1,b (X3) annihilated by '!f; (x), created 
by 1,b(x) and annihilated by '!f;(XI), and similarly for the bottom line. So we need 
G4(XI,X2,X3,X4) = (-ie)2':;,f321~3f34 J 
d4x J 
d4y 
X (0 IT {A/-L (x )AV (y ) '!f;a 1 (Xl )1,bf31( X )'!f;f32( X ){;a3( X3) 
x '!f;a2(X2){;f33(y)'!f;f3.(y){;a4(X4)}10). 
(13.35) 
Contractions of these spinors in this order gives the t-channel diagram in Eq. (13.30). 
For the u-channel, ordering the fields so that the contractions are in order gives 
G4(XI ,X2,X3,X4) = (-ie)2':;,f321~3f34 J 
d4x J 
d4y 
x (OIT {A/-L (x )AV (y )'!f;a,(XI)1,bf3,(X )'!f;f32(X )1f"'4(X4) 
x '!f;a2(X2){;f33(y)'!f;f34(y){;a3(X3)}10), (13.36) 
so that the u-channel diagram in Eq. (13.31) has a minus sign out front. The result is that 
the matrix element for M¢ller scattering has the form

effects. 
One can do the same exercise for loops. For example, a loop such as 
(13.38) 
comes from a term in the perturbative expansion of the time-ordered product for two photon 
fields of the form (leaving all spin or indices implicit) 
Gz = (-ie)2ba/3'" )(01 T{ A~(Xl)AII(xz)~(x)Aa(x)'ljJ(x)~(y)A/3(y)'ljJ(y)} 10). 
(13.39) 
To get the spinors into the order where they are created and then immediately destroyed, 
we need to anticommute 'ljJ(y) from the right to the left. That is, we use 
(13.40) 
Thus, the Feynman rule for this fermion loop should be supplemented with an additional 
minus sign. As an exercise, you should check that adding more photons to a fermionic loop 
does not change this overall minus sign. 
In summary, the Feynman rules for fermions must be supplemented by a factor of 
• -1 for interchange of external identical fermions. Diagrams such as s- and t-channel 
exchanges, which would be present even for non-identical particles, do not get an extra 
minus sign. The -1 is a relative minus sign between two diagrams that are related by 
interchanging two external identical particles. 
• -1 for each fermion loop. 
13.2 ,-matrix identities 
Before beginning the QED calculations, let us derive some useful identities about "(-
matrices. We will often need to take traces of products of ,,(-matrices. These can often 
be simplified using the cyclic property of the trace: 
Tr[AB .. . C] = Tr[B··· CAl· 
(13.41) 
229 

230 
Quantum electrodynamics 
----------------------------------------------------------~ 
We will often also use ')'5 == iT'O')'l ')'2/'3, which satisfies 
2 
')'5 = 1, 
')'5')'1-' = - ')'1-'')'5· 
(13.42) 
To keep the spin or indices straight, we sometimes write :n. for the identity on spinor 
indices. So, 
(13.43) 
and 
(13.44) 
The gI-'l/ are just numbers for each p, and v and pull out of the trace. 
Then 
(13.45) 
where we have cycled the ')'s-matrix in the second step. Thus 
(13.46) 
Similarly, 
(13.47) 
which leads to 
(l3.48) 
In a similar way, you can show 
(l3.49) 
and more generally that the trace of an odd number of ,),-matrices is zero. For four '"'(-
matrices, the result is (Problem 11.1) 
Tr[')'''''"'(I-''"'(,6')'I/] = 4(g"'l-'g,61/ _ g"',6gl-'l/ + gOOl/gl-',6). 
(13.50) 
You will use this last one a lot! You can remember the signs because adjacent indices give 
plus and the other one gives minus. 
A summary of important ,),-matrix identities is given in Appendix A. 
The muon, p,- , is a pmticle that is identical to the electron as far as QED is concerned, 
except heavier. Studying processes with muons therefore provides simple tests of QED. 
Indeed, the simplest tree-level scattering process in QED is e+ c 
--> p,+ p,-, which we 
calculate at tree-level here and at I-loop in Chapter 20. The leading-order contribution is

VCi(p2h~f3uf3(pI)klL = V(P2)IjIU(Pl) + V(P2)Ij2U(Pl)

e2 
M = - V(p2hlLu(pI)U(P3hlLv(P4) , 
(13.53) 
s 
where S = (PI + P2)2 as usual. 
To calculate IMI2 we need the conjugate amplitude. To get this, we first recall that 
(13.54) 
So, 
(13.55) 
This nice transformation property is another reason why using if; instead of 'l/J t is useful. 
Then, 
(13.56) 
and therefore 
e4 
IMI2 = 2" [v(P2hlLu(pl)] [u(P3hILV(P4)] [v(p4hVu(P3)] [u(pI)l'vV(P2)]' 
(13.57) 
s 
The grouping is meant to emphasize that each term in brackets is just a number for each 
J.L and each set of spins. Thus 1M 12 is a product of these numbers. For example, we could 
also have written 
e4 
IMI2 = 2" [v(p2hlLu(pI)] [u(Pl h
V v(P2)] [u(P3hILV(P4)] [v(p4hvu(p3)] , 
(13.58) 
s 
which shows that IMI2 is the contraction of two tensors, one depending only on the initial 
state, and the other depending only on the final state. 
13.3.1 Unpolarized scattering 
The easiest thing to calculate from this is the cross section for scattering assuming spin is 
not measured. The spin sum can be performed with a Dirac trace. To see this, we will sum 
Over the p,+ spins using 
231

Quantum electrodynamics 
-------------------------------------------------~ 
L

s 
S 
and over the p, - spins using 
(13.60) 
We have written each sum two ways to emphasize that these are sums over vectors of com_ 
plex numbers corresponding to external spinors, not over fermion fields. Thus, no ntinus 
sign is induced from reversing the order of the sum: u~ 
ii.~ = ii.~u~. 
Using these relations 
L L[U
S'(P3hl-'v
S(P4)] [ii

s' 
= (113 + ml-']) afj '~8(T/4 -
ml-'])8.'~a 
= Tr[(113 + ml-'hl-'(T/4 - ml-'hv]' 
which is a simple expression we can evaluate using ,-matrix identities. 
(13.61) 
Let us also assume that we do not know the polarization of the initial states. Then, if We 
do the measurement many times, we will get the average over each polarization. This leads 
to contractions and traces of the initial state, with a factor of ~ (! each for the incoming 
e+ and incoming e- ) to average over our ignorance. Thus we need 
1

IMI2 = 482 Tr[('f/l +mehV(11'2 - m e hlL] Tr [(113 + ml-'hl-'(T/4 - ml-'hV]. (13.62) 
spms 
These traces simplify using trace identities: 
Tr[(113 + ml-'ha (T/4 - ml-'h.B] = p~p~Tr[rp,a,O',.B] - m~Tr[ra,.B] 
= 4(P3P~ + P~P~ -

(13.63) 
So,

(13.68) 
13.3.2 Differential cross section 
For 2 -+ 2 scattering of particles of different mass, the cross section in the center-of-mass 
frame can be computed from the matrix element with Eq. (5.32): 
(13.69) 
There are only two variables on which the cross section depends: ECM and the scattering 
angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing muon. In the center-of-mass frame, 
the kinematics are as shown in Figure 13.1. 
With this choice of momenta, we find 
S = (Pl + P2)2 = 4E2 = E~M' 
(13.70) 
and so 
t = (Pl - P3)2 = m; + m~ - 2E2 + 2k-p,

Recall that scattering with spins transverse to the plane gave M ex 1 and scattering with 
spins in the plane gave M ex cos2 (), so this agrees with our previous analysis. You can 
check explicitly by choosing explicit spinors that our intuition with spin scattering agrees 
with QED even for the polarized cross section. Integrating the differential cross section 
over () gives ao = :~!l for the total cross section at tree-level. The I-loop correction to 
the total cross section Will be calculated in Chapter 20. 
13.4 Rutherford scattering e-p+ ---+ e-p+

' 
(13.79) 
where p = IPiI = Ipf l is the magnitude of the incoming electron momentum, which 
is the same as the magnitude of the outgoing electron momentum for elastic scatter-
ing. Rutherford calculated this using classical mechanics to describe how an electron 
would get deflected in a central potential, as from an atomic nucleus. We recalled in Sec-
tion 5.2 that Rutherford's formula is reproduced in quantum mechanics through the Born

(13.80) 
here k = Pi - PI is the momentum transfer satisfying I kl = 2p sin ~. 
'II We also reproduced these results from field theory, taking the non-relativistic limit 
before doing the calculation. We found that the amplitude is given by a t-channel diagram: 
(13.81) 
where the 2m; and 2m~ factors come from the non-relativistic normalization of the elec-
tron and proton states. Since t = (P3 - pd2 = _2p2 (1 - cos 8) = -4p2 sin ~ and 
E CM = mp in the center-of-mass frame, we reproduce the Rutherford formula. 
We will now do the calculation in QED. This will allow us to reproduce the above equa-
tion, but it will also give us the relativistic corrections. In this whole section, we neglect 
any internal structure of the proton, treating it, like the muon, as a pointlike particle. A 
discussion of what actually happens at extremely high energy, ECM » m p , is given in 
Chapter 32. 
13.4.1 QED amplitude 
As far as QED is concerned, a proton and a muon are the same thing, up to the sign of the 
charge, which gets squared anyway, and the mass. So let us start with e- p,- -) e- p,-. The 
amplitude is given by a t-channel diagram: 
(13.82) 
with k/l. = pi - pj. As in e+ e- -) p,+ p,-, the k/l. kl/ term drops out for on-shell spinors, 
as expected by gauge invariance. So this matrix element simplifies to 
(13.83) 
with t = (PI - P3)2. Summing over final states and averaging over initial states, 
235 

236 
Quantum electrodynamics 
---------------------------------------------------~ 
This is remarkably similar to what we had for e+e- -t p,+ p,-: 
4 
~ 2.:= IMI2 = :82 Tr[(lfi + mehl/(l/2 - mehP,]Tr[(1j3 + mp,hp,(T/4 - mp,h'l (13.85) 
spins 
In fact, the two are identical if we take the e+e- -t p,+ p,- formula and replace 
These changes send 8 -t t, or more generally, 
8 = (PI + P2)2 -t (PI - P3)2 = t, 
t = (PI - P3)2 -t (PI - P4)2 = U, 
U = (PI - P4)2 -t (PI + P2)2 = s. 
(13.86) 
(13.87) 
(13.88) 
(13.89) 
These replacements are not physical, since P2 -t -P3 produces a momentum with negative 
energy, which cannot be an external particle. It is just a trick, called a crossing relation, 
that lets us recycle tedious algebraic manipulations. You can prove crossing symmetries 
in general, even for polarized cross sections with particular spins, and there exist general 
crossing rules. However, rather than derive and apply these rules, it is often easier simply 
to write down the amplitude that you want and inspect it to find the right transformation. 
With the crossing symmetry we can just skip to the final answer. For e+ e- -t p,+ I-c

13.4.2 Corrections to Rutherford's formula 
Now let us take the limit mp » me to get the relativistic corrections to Rutherford's 
formula. In this limit we can treat the proton mass as effectively infinite, but we have to 
treat the electron mass as finite to go from the non-relativistic to the relativistic limit. As 
the proton mass goes to infinity, the momenta are

essentially the lab frame, the differential cross section is given by ~~ = 647r}E~M IMI2: 
(13.100) 
This is known as the Mott formula. Note that the limit mp --> 00 exists: there is no 
dependence on the proton mass. For slow velocities we can use v « 1 and P « E '" me

which is the Rutherford formula. In particular, note that the normalization factors, m~, 
worked out correctly. 
In the very high energy limit, E » m e, one can no longer assume that the final state 
proton is also at rest. However, one can now neglect the electron mass, so that v = 1. Then

where E' is the final state electron's energy. As mp ~ 00, E ~ E' and this reduces to the 
v ~ 1 limit of the Mott formula, Eq. (13.100). 
These formulas characterize the scattering of pointlike particles from other pointlike 
particles. Note that the final forms in which we have written these cross sections depend 
only on properties of the initial and final electrons. Thus, they are suited to experimen_ 
tal situations in which electrons are scattered by hydrogen gas and the final state proton 
momenta are not measured. Such experiments were carried out in the 1950s, notably at 
Stanford, and deviations of the measured cross section from the form of Eq. (13.103) led 
to the conclusion that the proton must have substructure. More shockingly, at very high 
energy, this pointlike scattering form was once again observed, indicating the presence 
of pointlike constituents within the proton, now known as quarks. We will discuss these 
important e- p+ scattering experiments and their theoretical interpretation in great detail 
in Chapter 32. 
13.5 Compton scattering 
The next process worth studying is the QED prediction for Compton scattering, ,,(e- ~ 
,,(e-. By simple relativistic kinematics, Compton was able to predict the shift in wavelength 
of the scattered light as a function of angle,

~A = -(1- cos e), 
(13.104)

but he could not predict the intensity of radiation at each angle. 
In the classical limit, for scattering of soft radiation against electrons, J. J. Thomson had 
derived the formula

(13.105) 
where 'T" e is the classical electron radius, 'T" e = ~, defined so that if the electron were a 
disk of radius 'T", the cross section would be 1f'T"2. The 1 comes from radiation polarized in 
the plane of scattering and the cos2e from polarization out of the plane, just as we saw for 
e+ e- ~ p,+ p,- in Section 5.3. From QED we should be able to reproduce this formula, 
plus the relativistic corrections.

We would next like to calculate the unpolarized cross section. 
13.5.1 Photon polarization sums 
To square this and sum over on-shell physical polarizations, it is helpful to employ a trick 
for the photon polarization sum. There is no way to write the sum over transverse modes in 
a Lorentz-invmiant way, since the only available dimensionless tensors are 9ILv and P;gv, 
but on-shell p2 = ° 
so p;f is undefined. 
Physical polarizations can be defined as orthogonal to plL and orthogonal to any other 
lightlike reference vector rlL as long as rlL is not proportional to pM. For example, if pM = 
(E, 0, 0, E), then the canonical polarizations tt = (0,1,0,0) and t~ = (0,0,1, 0) are 
orthogonal to plL = (E, 0, 0, - E). More generally, if plL = (E, if), then choosing the 
reference vector as rlL = pIL, where 
plL = (E, -if), 
(13.109) 
will uniquely determine the two transverse polarizations. Other choices of reference vector 
rf.L lead to transverse polarizations that are related to the canonical transverse polarizations 
by little-group transformations (Lorentz transformations that hold plL fixed). For example, 
with plL = (E, 0, 0, E) choosing rlL = (1 , 0, 1,0) leads to Et = (0, 1, 0,0) and E~ = 
(1, 0, 1, 1). Since E~ = t~ + iE pIL, there will be no difference in matrix elements calculated 
using these different polarization sets by the Ward identity. In fact, invariance under change 
of reference vector provides an important constraint on the form that matrix elements can 
have. This constraint will be efficiently exploited in the calculation of amplitudes using 
helicity spinors in Chapter 27. 
With the choice rlL = pIL, you should verify that (see Problem 8.5) 
(13.110) 
Now, suppose we have an amplitude involving a photon. Writing M = tILMIL, we find 
L IMI2 = t~iM;Mvt~ = - M;MIL+ 2~2 (pILM;MvPv + pILM;MvPv). (13.111)

13.5.2 Matrix element

Returning to the Compton scattering process, we are now ready to evaluate IMI2 summed 
over spins and polarizations. 1M 12 includes terms from the t-channel and s-channel dia-
grams squared as well as their cross terms (M~Ms + M;Md. To see what is involVed, 
let us just evaluate one piece in the high-energy limit where we can set m = O. In this limit

P4 = (w',w'sinB,O,w'cosB), 
P3 = PI +P2 -P4 = (E',p').

Near 8 = 11", as w » m, we see that the cross section becomes very large (but still finite). 
In this region of phase space, the photon and electron bounce off each other and go back 
the way they came. Or, in more Lorentz-invariant language, the direction of the outgoing 
photon momentum is the same as the direction of incoming electron momentum. Let us 
now try to understand the origin of the 8 = 11" singUlarity. 
Since the matrix element can be written in the massless limit as 
(13.141) 
forw » m and 
(13.142) 
243 

244 
Quantum electrodynamics 
---------------------------------------------------------------~ 
we see that the origin of the pole at e = 7r is due to the t-channel exchange. Looking back, 
the t-channel matrix element is 
2 
M t = - et 
E~E~*U(p3h l"(1}2 - 'I/4)"'{U(P2). 
(13.143) 
Since this scales as t we might expect the cross section to diverge as b "" (1+C~S of' In 
fact this would happen in a scalar field theory, such as one with interaction g¢3 for which 
(13.144) 
which has a strong t2 pole. In QED, we calculated the t-channel diagram in the massless

(13.145) 
This gives the entire t pole, so we do not have to wony about interference for the purpose 
of understanding the singUlarity. Where did the other factor of t come from to cancel the 
pole? 
For e = 7r - ¢ with ¢ "" 0, the momenta become 
PI = (w, 0, 0, w), 
P2 = (w,O,O,-w), 
P3 = (w, - wc/J,O,w), 
P4 = (w,w¢,O, -w) , 
(13.146) 
and then 
(13.147) 
So a t pole goes as p, but fx goes as ;4' But notice that the momentum factor in the 
matrix element also vanishes as P2 ---7 P4: 
1}2 - T/4 = -w¢ ~, 
kl" = (0, 1,0,0). 
(13.148) 
So, 
(13.149) 
Thus, one factor of ¢ is canceling. This factor came from the spinors, and is an effect of 
angular momentum conservation. 
If we include the electron mass, as in Eq. (13.140), we would have found w2¢~tm~ 
instead of wl¢, which is finite even for exactly backwards scattering. So there is not really 
a divergence. Still, the cross section becomes very large for nearly backwards scattering. 
More discussion of these types of infrared divergences is given in Chapter 20.

we can write W = WL + WHo Then we use {'>,(1 + {'5)

and so on. The general rule is that an odd number of {'-matrices couples RR and LL while 
an even number couples LR and RL. 
In particular, our interaction M t has three {,-matrices, so it couples RR and LL. Thus,

which is helicity conserving. So, U(P2) and U(P3) should be either both right-handed or 
both left-handed. This is consistent with a general property of QED, that in the limit of a 
massless electron, the left- and right-handed states completely decouple. 
Now recall our explicit electron polarizations in the massless limit:

so 
(13.161) 
Thus, everything is right-handed or everything is left-handed. 
This has an important physical implication. Consider shooting a laser beam at a high_ 
energy beam of electrons. Lasers are polarized. Suppose the laser produces left circularly 
polarized light. Such a beam will dominantly back-scatter only left-handed electrons. This 
is a useful way to polarize your electron beam. It also directly connects helicity for spinors 
to helicity for spin-l particles. 
13.6 Historical note 
Considering only 2 ----+ 2 scattering involving electrons, positrons, muons, antimuons 
and photons, there are quite a number of historically important processes in QED. Some 
examples are 
• ,,(e-
----+ ,,(e-: Compton scattering. Observed in 1923 by American physicist Arthur 
Holly Compton [Compton, 1923]. The differential scattering formula was calculated by 
Oskar Klein and Yoshio Nishina in 1929 [Klein and Nishina, 1929]. This was one of the 
first results obtained from QED, and was crucial in convincing us of the correctness of 
Dirac's equation. Before this, all that was known was the classical Thomson scattering 
formula, which was already in disagreement with experiment by the early 1920s. The 
Klein-Nishina formula agreed perfectly with available experiments in the late 1920s. 
However, at higher energies, above 2 Me V or so, it looked wrong. It was not until many 
years later that the discrepancy was shown to be due to the production of e- e+ pairs, 
with the positron annihilating into some other electron, and to Bremsstrahlung. 
• e-e-
----+ e- e-: M011er scattering. First calculated in the ultra-relativistic regime by 
Danish physicist Christian M011er [M011er, 1932]. In the non-relativistic regime it is 
called Coulomb scattering or Rutherford scattering. M011er calculated the cross section 
based on some guesses and consistency requirements, not using QED. The cross sec-
tion was calculated in QED soon after by Bethe and Fermi [Bethe and Fermi, 1932]. 
M011er scattering was not measured until 1950 by Canadian physicist Lome Albert 
Page [Page, 1950]. This was partly because researchers did not consider it interesting 
until renormalization was understood and radiative corrections could be measured. 
• e+ e-
----+ e+ e-: Bhabha scattering. First calculated by Indian physicist Homi Jehengir 
Bhabha in 1936 [Bhabha, 1936]. The positron was not discovered until 1932, so it was 
a while before the differential cross section that Bhabha predicted could be measured in 
the lab. However, the total cross section for e+ e- ----+ e+ e- was important for cosmic-ray 
physics from the 1930s onward. 
• "("( ----+ ,,(T Light-by-light scattering. In 1933, German physicist Otto Halpern real-
ized that QED predicted that light could scatter off light [Halpern, 1933]. There is no 
tree-level contribution to this process in QED. The first contribution comes from a boX

One should keep in mind that QED was being developed not long after quantum mechan-
icS itself was discovered. Physicists were still coming to terms with the violations of 
classical causality inherent in the quantum theory, and some, including Bohr and Dirac, 
suspected that the difficulties of QED might be related to an incomplete understanding 
of causality. Bohr, with Kramers and Slater, had proposed in 1924 a version of quantum 
mechanics in which energy was not conserved microscopically, only statistically [Bohr 
ef ai., 1924]. Although experiments in the late 1920s confirmed that energy was indeed 
conserved microscopically, an experiment by Shankland in 1936 implied that perhaps it 
was not [Shankland, 1936]. Dirac immediately jumped at this opportunity to disown QED, 
claiming, "because of its extreme complexity, most physicists will be glad to see the end 
of it" [Dirac, 1936, p. 299]. Bohr, as late as 1938, ruminated that perhaps the violations 
of causality in quantum mehanics were just the beginning and a more "radical departure" 
from classical theory would be necessary [Bohr, 1938, p. 29]. He nevertheless was suf-
ficiently impressed with QED and its "still more complex abstractions" that he argued it 
"entails the greatest encouragement to proceed on such lines." [Bohr, 1938, p. 17]. It turns 
out that the resolution of the difficulties of QED are not related to causality (although they 
do involve more complex abstractions). As we will see in Part III, the key to performing 
calculations in QED beyond leading order in a is to carefully relate observable quantities 
to other observable quantities. 
It was not until 1947, at the famous Shelter Island conference, that experiments finally 
showed that there were finite effects subleading in a, which gave theorists something pre-
cise to calculate. The next year, Schwinger came out with his celebrated calculation of the 
leading radiative correction to the electron magnetic moment: 9 - 2 = ~ (Chapter 17). 
That, and the agreement between Willis Lamb's measurement of the splitting between the 
2S1/2 and 2Pl/2 levels of the hydrogen atom (the hyperfine structure) and Hans Bethe's 
calculation of that splitting firmly established QED as predictive and essentially correct. 
For additional information about the history of QED, there are a number of excellent 
accounts. Abraham Pais' Inward Bound [Pais, 1986] is classic; Mehra and Milton's scien-
tific biography of Schwinger [Mehra et ai., 2000] and Schweber's book [Schweber, 1994] 
are also highly recommended.

This agrees with experiment, as the simulated data on the left side of Figure 13.2 
show. The angular distribution for scattering into muon neutrinos, e+ e- --; v/1v/1' is 
very different, as shown on the right side of Figure 13.2, where now () is the angle

the Z. Deduce how atot should depend on ECM for the two processes.

respectively. Assume the Z couples to the electron in the same way as it cou-
ples to neutrinos. Calculate the full angular dependence for e+ e- --; v/1v/1 as a

(d) An easier way to see parity violation is in ,8-decay. This is mediated by charged

far we have studied quantum field theory using the canonical quantization approach, 
S~ich' is based on creation and annihilation operators. There is a completely different way 
: do quantum field theory called the path integral formulation. It says 
(14.1) 
The left-hand side is exactly the kind of time-ordered product we use to calculate S-
matrix elements. The D¢ on the right-hand side means integrate over all possible classical 
field configurations ¢( X, t) with a phase given by the classical action evaluated in that field 
configuration. 
14.1 Introduction 
The intuition for the path integral comes from a simple thought experiment you can do in 
quantum mechanics. Recall the double-slit experiment: the amplitude for a field to propa-
gate from a source through a screen with two slits to a detector is the sum of the amplitudes 
to propagate through each slit separately. We add up the two amplitudes and then square 
to get the probability. If instead we had three slits and three screens, the amplitude would 
come from the sum of all possible paths through the slits and screens. And so on, for four 
slits, five slits, etc. Taking the continuum limit, we can keep slitting until the screen is gone. 
The result is that the final amplitude is the sum of all possible different paths. That is all 
the path integral is calculating. This is illustrated in Figure 14.1. 
There is something very similar in classical physics called Huygens' principle. Huy-
gens proposed in 1678 that to calculate the propagation of waves you can treat each point 
in the wavefront as the center of a fresh disturbance and a new source for the waves. A very 
intuitive example is surface waves in a region with obstructions, as shown in Figure 14.2. 
As the wave goes through a gap between barriers, a new wave starts from the gap and keeps 
going. This is useful, for example, in thinking about diffraction, where you can propagate 
the plane wave along to the slits, and then start waves propagating anew from each slit. 
Actually, it was not until 1816 that Fresnel realized that you could add amplitudes for the 
Waves weighted by a phase given by the distance divided by the wavelength to explain 
251 

252 
Path integrals 
------------------------~--------------------~ 
The classic double slit allows for two paths between the initial and final points. Adding 
more screens and more slits allows for more diverse paths. An infinite number of screens 
and slits makes the amplitude the sum over all possible paths, as encapsulated in the path 
integral. 
interference and diffraction. Thus, the principle is sometimes called the Huygens-Fresnel 
principle. The path integral is an implementation of this principle for quantum mechani_ 
cal waves, with the phase determined by ~ times the action. Huygens' principle follows 
from the path integral since, as you take n ---+ 0, this phase is dominated by the minimUm 
of the action which is the classical action evaluated along the classical path. For n of. 0, 
there is a contribution from non-minimal action configurations that provide the quantum 
corrections. 
There are a number of amazing things about path integrals. For example, they imply 
that by dealing with only classical field configurations you can get the quantum amplitude. 
This is really crazy if you think about it - these classical fields all commute;so you are also 
getting the non-commutativity for free somehow. Time ordering also just seems to pop out. 
And where are the particles? What happened to second quantization? 
One way to think about path integrals is that they take the wave nature of matter to 
be primary, in contrast to the canonical method which is all about particles. Path integral 
quantization is in many ways simpler than canonical quantization, but it obscures some of 
the physics. Nowadays, people often just start with the path integral, using it to define the 
quantum theory. Path integrals are particularly useful to quantify non-perturbative effects. 
Examples include lattice QCD, instantons, black holes, etc. On the other hand, for cal-
culations of discrete quantities such as energy eigenstates, and for many non-relativistic 
problems, the canonical formalism is much more practical. 
Another important contrast between path integrals and the canonical approach is which 
symmetries they take to be primary. In the canonical approach, with the Hilbert space 
defined on spatial slices, matrix elements came out Lorentz invariant almost magically. 
With path integrals, Lorentz invariance is manifest the whole way through and Feynman 
diagrams appear very natural, as we will see. On the other hand, the Hamiltonian and 
Hilbert space are obscure in the path integral. That the Hamiltonian should be Hermitian 
and have positive definite eigenvalues on the Hilbert space (implying unitarity) is very 
hard to see with path integrals. So manifest unitarity is traded for manifest Lorentz invari-
ance. Implications of unitarity for a general quantum field theory are discussed more in 
Chapter 24. 
In this chapter, we will first derive the path integral from the canonical approach in 
the traditional way. Then we will perform two alternate derivations: we will show that we

reproduce the same perturbation series for time-ordered products (Feynman rules), and also 
shoW that the Schwinger-Dyson equations are satisfied. As applications, we will demon-
strate the power of the path integral by proving gauge invariance and the Ward identity 
non-perturbatively in QED. 
14.1.1 Historical note 
Before around 1950, most QED calculations were done simply with old-fashioned per-
turbation theory. Schwinger (and Tomonaga around the same time) figured out how to 
do the calculations systematically using the interaction picture and applied the theory to 
radiative corrections. In particular, this method was used in the seminal calculations of 
the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron in 1947/8. There were no diagrams. 
The diagrams, with loops, and Feynman propagators came from Feynman's vision of par-
ticles going forwards and backwards in time, and from his path integral. For example, 
Feynman knew that you could sum the retarded and advanced propagators together into 
one object (the Feynman propagator), while Schwinger and Tomonaga would add them 
separately. 
Actually, Feynman did not know at the time how to prove that what he was cal-
culating was what he wanted; he only had his intuition and some checks that he was 
correct. One of the ways Feynman could validate his approach was by showing that 
his tree-level calculations matched all the known results of QED. He then just drew 
the next picture and calculated the radiative correction. He could check his answers, 
eventually, by comparing to Schwinger and Tomonaga and, of course, to data, which 
were not available before 1947. He also knew his method was Lorentz covariant, which 
made the answers simple - another check. But what he was doing was not under-
stood mathematically until Freeman Dyson cleaned things up in two papers in 1949 
[Dyson, 1949]. Dyson's papers went a long way to convincing skeptics that QED was 
consistent. 
253 

254 
Path integrals 
------------------------------~--------------------------~ 
There is a great story that Feynman recounted about the famous Poconos conference 
of 1948, where he and Schwinger both presented their calculations of the Lamb shift. 
Schwinger's presentation was polished and beautiful (but unintelligible, even to the eXperts 
such as Dirac and Pauli in the audience). Feynman got up and started drawing his pictures 
but not knowing exactly how it worked, was unable to convince the bewildered audience: 
Feynman recounted [Mehra et aI., 2000, p. 233]: 
Already in the beginning I had said that I'll deal with single electrons, and I was going 
to describe this idea about a positron being an electron going backward in time, and 
Dirac asked, "Is it unitary?" I said, "Let me try to explain how it works, and you can 
tell me whether it is unitary or not!" I didn't even know then what "unitary" meant. So 
I proceeded further a bit, and Dirac repeated his question: "Is it unitary?" So I finally 
said: "Is what unitary?" Dirac said: "The matrix which carries you from the present to 
the future position." I said, "I haven't got any matrix which carries me from the present 
to the future position. I go forwards and backwards in time, so I do not know what the 
answer to your question is." 
Teller was asking about the exclusion principle for virtual electrons; Bohr was asking about 
the uncertainty principle. Feynman did not have answers for any of these questions, he just 
knew his method worked. He concluded, "I'll just have to write it all down and publish it, 
so that they can read it and study it, because I know it is right! That's all there is to it." And 
so he did. 
14.2 The path integral 
The easiest way to derive the path integral is to start with non-relativistic quantum mechan-
ics. Before deriving it, we will work out a simple mathematical formula for Gaussian 
integrals that is used in practically every path integral calculation. We then reproduce 
the derivation of the path integral in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, which you 
have probably already seen. The quantum field theory delivation is then a more-or-less 
straightforward generalization to the continuum. 
14.2.1 Gaussian integrals 
A general one-dimensional Gaussian integral is defined as 
(14.2) 
To compute this integral, we first complete the square 
(14.3)

(14.5) 
SO, 
(14.6) 
For multi-dimensional integrals, we need only generalize to many Pi, which may be 
complex. Then ap2 ---+ pr aijPj = pt Aji, with A a matrix. After diagonalizing A the 
integral becomes just a product of integrals over the Pi, and the result is the product of 
one-dimensional Gaussian integrals, with a being replaced by an eigenvalue of A. That is, 
1
00 dp e-!vtAp+jtp = 
-00 
(14.7) 
where A comes from the product of the eigenvalues in the diagonal basis and n is the 
dimension of p. 
14.2.2 Path integral in quantum mechanics 
Consider one-dimensional non-relativistic quantum mechanics with the Hamiltonian 
given by 
'2 
, 
P 
H(t) = -
+ V(x, t) . 
2m 
Here iI, p and x are operators acting on the Hilbert space, and t is just a number. 
(14.8) 
Suppose our initial state Ii) = IXi) is localized at Xi at time ti and we want to project it 
onto the final state (f I = (x f I localized at x f at time t f. If ji did not depend on t, then we 
could just solve for the matrix element as 
(14.9) 
If instead we only assume iI (t) is a smooth function of t, then we can only solve for the 
matrix element this way for infinitesimal time intervals. So, let us break this down into n 
small time intervals ot and define tj = ti + jOt and tn = tf. Then, 
(IIi) = Jdxn ... dXI (x f le-iHCtf )ot IXn) (xn I· . ·IX2) (x2Ie-iH(t 2 )Ot IXI) (xlle-iH(h)ot IXi).

Now we can use the Gaussian integral in Eq. (14.6), J dp exp ( -
~ ap2 + J p) 
Iii exp U:), with a = i~ and J = i(Xj+l -
Xj) to get 
(14.12) 
where N is an x- and t-independent normalization constant, which we will justify ignoring 
later, and 
1 
L(x, x) = 2mx2 - V(x, t) 
(14.13) 
is the Lagrangian. We see that the Gaussian integral effected a Legendre transform to go 
from H ( x, p) to L ( x, x). 
Using Eq. (14.12), each term in Eq. (14.10) becomes just a number and the product 
reduces to 
(14.14) 
Finally, taking the limit ot --+ 0, the exponentials combine into an integral over dt and 
we get 
l
X (tf)=x f 
(IIi) = N 
_ 
Dx(t)eiS[xJ, 
X(t;)-Xi 
(14.15) 
where Dx means sum over all paths x(t) with the correct boundary conditions and the 
action is S[x] = J dt £[x(t), x(t)]. Note that N has been redefined and is now formally 
infinite, but it will drop out of any physical quantities, as we will see in the path integral 
case. 
14.2.3 Path integral in quantum field theory 
The field theory derivation is very similar, but the set of intermediate states is more com-
plicated. We will start by calculating the vacuum matrix element (OJ tf 10j ti). In quantum 
mechanics we broke the amplitude down into integrals over Ix)(xl for intermediate times 
where the states Ix) are eigenstates of the x operator. In field theory, the equivalents of i; 
are the Schrodinger picture fields ¢(x), which at any time t can be written as

Each field comprises an infinite number of operators, one at each point x. We put the hat 
on ¢ to remind you that it is an operator.

The equivalent of Ix) is a complete set of eigenstates of ¢: 
¢( x) I <I» = <I> (x) I <I». 
(14.19) 
The eigenvalues are functions of space <I>(X).1 The equivalents of Ip) are the eigenstates of 
11'( x) that satisfy 
1i"(x)III) = II (x) III) . 
(14.20) 
The III) states are conjugate to the I<I» states, and satisfy 
(III<I» = exp ( - i J 
d3x II(x) <I> (x) ) , 
(14.21) 
which is the equivalent of (iJ Ix) = e-iPX. The inner product of two I<I» states is

VII(<I>'III) (III<I» = J

(14.22) 
which is the generalization of (x'lx) = 8(x - x') = J g~ exp( -iiJ(x - x')). You can 
construct these states explicitly and check these inner products in Problem 14.4. 
Using ¢ and 1i" one can rewrite the Hamiltonian so as not to include any time derivatives. 
We found in Eq. (8.16) that the energy density for a real scalar field was given by 
£ = ~(8t¢)2 + ~C9¢)2 + ~m2¢2.

after the replacement of a(~~¢) = 3d) by ir (as in a Legendre transform). More generally, 
let us write 
~ 
1 
A 
7-{ = _ir2 + V(¢),

(14.25) 
where V( ¢) can include interactions. One can con ider more general Hamiltonians, as long 
as they are Hermitia? and positive ~efinite, but we stick to ones 5>1" this form for simplicity. 
We will also write H(t) = J d3x 7-{ with the t dependence of H(t) coming from how the 
field operators change with time in the full interacting theory.2 
Now we calculate the vacuum matrix element by inserting complete sets of intermediate 
states, as in quantum mechanics: 
(0; tflO; ti) = J 
D<PI(X)'" D<pn(x)(Ole-ic5tH(tn)l<pn)(<pn 1··· 1 <PI) (<PI le-ic5tH(to) 10). 
(14.26) 
Each of these pieces becomes 
(<PHI le-ic5tH(t j ) I<pj) = J 
DIIj (<PHlIIIj) (IIj lexp [-iot J 
d3X(~ir2 + V(¢))] I<r?j) 
= J 
dIIj exp (i J 
d3x IIj(x) [<PHI (x) - <Pj (x)]) 
x exp ( -iot J 
d3x (~II;(X) + V.(<P j ))). (14.27) 
Now we perform the Gaussian integral over IIj to give 
(14.28) 
where 
1 
2 
I: [<pj, 3t <Pj] = "2 (3t <pj) - V [<pj]. 
(14.29) 
Collapsing up the pieces ofEq. (14.26) gives 
(0; t flO; t i ) = N J 
D<p (x, t)eiS[<l>J, 
(14.30) 
where S[<p] = J d4xl:[<p] with the time integral going from ti to tf. For S-matrix ele-
ments, we take ti = -00 and tf = +00, in which case the integral in S[<p] = J d4x I:[<r?] 
is over all space-time. 
So the path integral tells us to integrate over all classical field configurations <P. Note 
that <P does not just consist of the one-particle states, it can have two-particle states, etc. We 
can remember this by drawing pictures for the paths - including disconnected bubbles - as 
2 If V depended on 7r and 40, there might be an ordering ambiguity; this is no different than in the non-relativistiC 
case and it is conventional to define the Hamiltonian to be Wey\ ordered with the 7r operators all to the left of

regimes. 
14.2.4 Classical limit 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As a first check on the path integral, we can take the classical limit. To do that, we need to 
put back n, which can be done by dimensional analysis. Since n has dimensions of action, 
it appears as 
(14.31) 
Using the method of stationary phase we see that, in the limit n ---t 0, this integral is 
dominated by the value of <I> for which S[<I>J has an extremum. But oS = 0 is precisely 
the condition that determines the Euler-Lagrange equations which a classical field satis-
fies. Therefore, the only configuration that contributes in the classical limit is the classical 
solution to the equations of motion. 
In case you are not familiar with the method of stationary phase (also known as the 
method of steepest descent), it is easy to understand. The quickest way is to start with the 
same integral without the i: 
(14.32) 
In this case, the integral would clearly be dominated by the <1>0 where S[<I>J has a minimum; 
everything else would give a bigger S[<I>J and be infinitely more suppressed as n ---t O. Now, 
when we put the i back in, the same thing happens, not because the non-minimal terms are 
zero, but because away from the minimum you have to sum over phases swirling around 
infinitely fast. When you sum infinitely swirling phases, you also get something that goes 
to zero when compared to something with a constant phase. Another way to see it is to 
use the more intuitive case with e-iS[<I>l. Since we expect the answer to be well defined, 
it should be an analytic function of <1>0. So we can take n ---t 0 in the imaginary direction, 
showing that the integral is still dominated by S[<I>oJ. 
14.2.5 Time-ordered products 
Suppose we insert a field at fixed position and time into the path integral: 
(14.33) 
What does this represent? 
259 

260 
Path integrals 
----~ ----------------------------------------------------------~ 
Going back through our derivation, this integral can be written as 
I = J 
VfP1 (x) ... VfPnUi!) 
x (Ole-iH(tn)OtlfPn)'" (fP2Ie- iH(t2)OtlfPl)(fPlle-iH(ttl8tI0)fPj(xj), 
(14.34) 
with fP(Xj, tj) getting replaced by fPj (Xj) since the j subscript on fPj (x) refers to the time. 
Now we want to replace fPiXj) by an operator. Since the subscript on fP is just its point in 
time, we have 
J 
VfPj(X) { e- iH(tn )Ot IfPj)fPj(Xj) (fPjI} = ¢(Xj) J 
VfPj(x)e-iH(tn)OtlfPj) (fPjl . 
(14.35) 
So we get to replace fP (x j) by the operator ¢( x j ) put in at the time t j . Then we can collapse 
up all the integrals to give 
(14.36) 
If you find the coUapsing-up-the-integrals confusing, just think about the derivation back-
wards. An insertion of ¢( Xj, tj) will end up by I fP j) (fP j I, producing the eigenvalue 
fP(Xj , tj). 
Now say we insert two fields: 
(14.37) 
The fields will be inserted in the appropriate matrix element. In paI1icular, the earlier field 
will always come out on the right of the later field. So we get 
(14.38) 
In general, 
(14.39) 
Thus, we get time ordering for free in the path integral! 
Why does this work? As a quick cross check, suppose the answer were 
(14.40) 
without the time ordering. The left-hand side does not care whether we write fP(Xl)fP(X2) 
or fP(x2)fP(xd, since these are classical fields, but the right-hand side does distinguish 
¢(Xl)¢(X2) from ¢(X2)¢(Xl), since the fields do not commute (at timelike separation). 
Thus, Eq. (14.40) cannot be correct. The only possible equivalent of the left-hand side 
would be something in which the operators effectively commute, such as the time-ordering 
operation. 
We are also generally interested in interacting theories. For an interacting theory, one has 
to be able to go between the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian to derive the path integral. 

14.3 Generating fUnctionals 
'hj i rarely done explicitly, and for lheories such as non-Abelian gauge theories, it may 
1 ! even be pos. ible. Fortunately. we can simply define the quantum theory through the 
11:111 integral expres ed in terms of an action. In the interacting case, we must normalize so 
~lat the interacting vacuum remains the vacuum, (12112) = 1. This fixes the normalization 
an d leads to 
(14.41) 
from which the constant N drops out. The generalization to arbitrary Green's functions is 
iven in Eq. (14.l). 
g Unless there is any ambiguity, from now on we will use the standard notation ¢(x) 
instead of <1> (x) for the classical fields being integrated over in the path integral. 
14.3 Generating functionals 
There is a great way to calculate path integrals using currents. Consider the action in the 
presence of an external classical source J (x). The vacuum amplitude in the presence of 
this source is then a functional called the generating functional and is denoted by Z[J]: 
Z[J] = J 
D¢exp {is[¢] + i J 
d4XJ(X)¢(x)} . 
(14.42) 
At J = 0, this reduces to the vacuum amplitude without the source: 
Z[O] = J 
D¢ei J d
4
x£[¢l . 
(14.43) 
We next introduce the variational partial derivative. Since J(y) = j d4x5(x - y)J(x) it 
is natural to define 
8J(x) 
4 
8J(y) =5 (x-y). 
(14.44) 
This partial derivative can be thought of as varying to the value of J at y, holding all other 
values of J fixed. This equation implies that 
8 J 
4 
8J(xd 
d x J(x) ¢(x) = ¢(Xl)' 
(14.45) 
Then, 
(14.46) 
and thus, 
_i_l_ ~I = jD¢exp{iS[¢]}¢(xd = (nl¢(x )112) 
Z[O] 8J(Xl) J=O 
j D¢ei J d4 xJ.:[¢l

(14.47)

262 
Path integrals 
Similarly 
So this is a nice way of calculating time-ordered products - we can calculate Z[J] once 
and for all, and then to get time-ordered products all we have to do is take derivatives. 
The generating functional is the quantum field theory analog of the partition function 
in statistical mechanics - it tells us everything we could possibly want to know about a 
system. The generating functional is the holy grail of any particular field theory: if You 
have an exact closed-form expression for Z[J] for a particular theory, you have solved it 
completely. 
14.3.1 Solving the free theory 
---------------------------------------------------------------
In the free theory, we can calculate the generating functional exactly. For a real scalar field, 
the Lagrangian is 
(14.49) 
Then, using the notation Zo [J] for the generating functional in the free theory, 
(14.50) 
We can solve this exactly since it is quadratic in the fields. We just need to use our relation 
(14.51) 
with A = i(O + m 2 ). To compute A-I we need to take the inverse of -(0 + m 2 ) and 
multiply by i. This inverse is a function II(x - y) satisfying 
(Ox + m2)II(x - y) = -o(x - y). 
(14.52) 
As we know, this equation is solved by the propagator 
II(x - y) = J d

These are the same three contractions we found in the canonical approach in Chapter 7 
(cf. Eq. (7.17». More generally, each derivative can either kill a J factor or pull a J factor 
down from the exponential. At the end, we set J = 0 so the kills must be paired up with the 
pUll-downs. The Zo[O] factor gives the vacuum bubbles that drop out of the connected part 
of the S-matrix, as they did in the Hamiltonian derivation of the Feynman rules presented 
in Section 7.2.

Then, we can write

where Zo[J] is the generating functional in the free theory.

For example, taking two derivatives to form the 2-point function and normalizing by Z[Qj 
we find

which agrees with Eq. (7.64) from Chapter 7. So we have reproduced the Feynman rules 
from the path integral. 
14.4 Where is the i€? 
In the derivation of the path integral, propagators seemed to come out as p2 -=m 2 without the 
iE. What happened to the iE, which was supposed to tell us about time ordering? Without 
the iE the path integral is actually undefined, both physically (for example, not specifying

14.4.1 S-matrix 
-
In using the path integral to calculate S-matrix elements, the fields being integrated over 
Ulust match onto the free fields at t = ±oo. We can write the S-matrix in terms of the path 
integral as 
UISli) = r 
V¢eiS[¢l. 
} ¢(t=±oo) constrained 
(14.63) 
This notation matches how boundary conditions are imposed in the non-relativistic path 
integral, where one integrates over x(t) constrained so that the path satisfies X(ti) = Xi 
and X(tf) = xf' In the path integral, the requirement is that the functions ¢(x) that are 
being integrated over match onto the free fields at t = ±oo. To make this more precise, we 
can write the constraints as projections on the states for which ¢(£) are eigenvalues: 
UISli) = J 
V¢eiS[¢lUI¢ (t = +oo))(¢ (t = -(0) Ii). 
(14.64) 
Here, we have reinstated the notation from Section 14.2.3 that I¢) is the eigenstate of the 
field operator ¢(£), as in Eq. (14.19): ¢(x) I¢) = ¢(x) I¢). Equation (14.64) says that the 
path integral is restricted to an integral over field configurations with the right boundary 
conditions for a scattering problem. 
Let us consider the free theory, and restrict to the case where If) = Ii) = 10), which 
is enough to derive the ie. For the vacuum amplitude, we need to evaluate (<1>10) with 10) 
defined by ap 10) = O. For a single harmonic oscillator, the vacuum is replaced by the 
ground state and, as you may recall, the ground state's wavefunction is ¢(x) = (xIO) =

e- 'IX ,up to some constants. The free-field theory version is also a Gaussian: 
(14.65) 
where N is some constant and 
(14.66) 
In Problem 14.3 you can derive this, and also find an explicit expression for E (x, y) in terms 
of Hankel functions. We give neither the derivation nor the explicit form since neither is 
relevant for the final answer. 
265

At this point, we have 
(OI<1>(t = +(0)) (<1>(t = -(0)1°) 
= INI2 exp ( -~ j d3x d3y[¢(x, (0) ¢(f}, (0) + ¢(x, -(0) ¢(f}, -(0)] [(x, f})) . 
(14.67) 
To massage this into a form that looks more like a local interaction in the path integral, We 
need to insert a dt integral. We can do that with the identity (see Problem 14.4) 
1(00) + 1(-00) = E~~+ E £: dt1(t)e- Eltl , 
(14.68) 
which holds for any smooth function 1 (T) (here, E --+ 0+ means E is taken to zero from 
above). Then

14.4.2 Reflection positivity 
Mathematical physicists will tell you that the iE is required by the condition of reflection 
positivity. This is the requirement that under time-reversal, fields should have positive 
energy. More precisely, the restricted Hilbert space of physical fields, ¢(x, t) with pos-
itive energy, generates another Hilbert space of positive-energy fields when reflected in

A quick way to ee how COJ1si tency affects the path il1tegral is that without the iE the

(14.73) 
Although this is the quickest way to justify the ie factor, it does not explain why ie 
appears and not -ie, which would be anti-time ordering. In fact, both ±ie are equally valid 
path integrals, although only +ie leads to causal scattering (-ie gives anti-time-ordered 
products). 
One problem with the mathematical physics arguments is that even with reflection posi-
tivity and with the ie factor, the path integral still is not completely well defined. In fact, the 
path integral has only been shown to exist for a few cases. As of the time of this writing, the 
path integral (and field theories more generally) is only known to exist (i.e. have a precise 
mathematical definition) for free theories, and for ¢4 theory in two or three dimensions. ¢4 
theory in five dimensions is known not to exist. In four dimensions, we do not know much, 
exactly. We do not know if QED exists, or if scalar ¢4 exists, or even if asymptotically free 
or conformal field theories exist. In fact, we do not know if any field theory exists, in a 
mathematically precise way, in four dimensions. 
14.5 Gauge invariance 
One of the key things that makes path integrals useful is that we can do field redefini-
tions. Here we will use field redefinitions to prove gauge invariance, by which we mean 
independence of the covariant-gauge parameter~. To do so, we will explicitly separate out 
the gauge degrees of freedom by rewriting AIL = AIL + 0IL7r and then factor out the path 
integral over 7r. The following is a simplified version of a general method introduced by 
Faddeev and Popov, which is covered in Sections 25.4 and 28.4. 
Recall that the Lagrangian for a massless spin-l particle is .c = -
~ F~v + JILAIL , which 
leads to the momentum space equations of motion: 
(14.74) 
These equations are not invertible because the operator k2 gILv -
kILkv has zero deter-
l1linant (it has an eigenvector klL with eigenvalue 0). The physical reason it is not 
267 

268 
Path integrals 
-------------------------------------------------~ 
invertible is because we cannot uniquely solve for AIL in terms of JIL because of gauge 
invariance: 
(14.75) 
In other words, many vector fields correspond to the same current. Our previous solution 
was to gauge-fix by adding the term 211; (GILAIL)2 to the Lagrangian. Now we will justify that 
prescription, and prove gauge-invariance: any matrix element of gauge-invariant operators 
will be independent of ~. More precisely, with a general set of fields ¢i and interactions We 
will show that correlation functions 
are ~ independent, where 0(X1 ... xn) refers to any gauge-invariant collection of fields. 
Recall that we can always go to a gauge where GILAIL = O. Since under a gauge trans_ 
formation GILAIL ---+ GILAIL + 00;, we can always find a function 0; such that Do; = GILA!". 
We will write this function as 0; = -bGILAw Now consider the following function: 
(14.77) 
which is just some function of ~, probably infinite. As we will show, thi~ represents the 
path integral over gauge orbits which will factor out of the full path integral. To see that, 
shift the field by 
(14.78) 
This is just a shift, so the integration measure does not change. Then, 
(14.79) 
This is still just the same function of ~, which despite appearances is independent of Aw 
We can multiply and divide Eq. (14.76) by f(~) in the two different forms, giving 
(OIT{0(X1·· ·xn)}IO) = Z~Ol ft~) J 
V1fVAILV¢iV ¢7 
x ei J d4x[L[A,¢il-~(D7r-&I'AI')2l 0(X1 ... xn). 
(14.80) 
Now let us do the "Stueckelberg trick" and perform a gauge transformation shift, with 1f(x) 
as our gauge parameter: 
(14.81) 
Again, the measure V1fVAILV¢i, the action .e[A, ¢i], and the operator 0, which is gauge-
invariant by assumption, do not change. We conclude that the path integral is the same as 
the gauge-fixed version up to normalization: 

14.6 Fermionic path integral

DAf1>D¢iD¢7 
x eif d
4 x.c[A'¢iJ-*(8I' A I')2 O(Xl··· xn). 
(14.82) 
conveniently, the same normalization appears when we perform the same manipulations 
to Z[O]: 
Z[O] = [f(~) J 
DW] J 
DAf1>D¢iD¢7eiJ d
4
x.c[A,¢;)-*(8I' A I')2. 
(14.83) 
Thus, the normalization drops out and we find that 
J VA1LD¢/D¢-;eiJ d",;C[A,4>·JO(Xi) 
(DIT{O(Xl·· ·xn )} ID) =

J DAf1>D¢iD¢;ei J d
4 x.c[A,¢il-* (81' A/i J2 
(14.84) 
That is, correlation functions calculated with the gauge-fixed Lagrangian will give the same 
results as correlation functions calculated with the gauge-invariant Lagrangian. In other 
words, (DIT{ O(XI ... xn)} ID) calculated with the gauge-fixed Lagrangian is completely 
independent of ~. 
Unfortunately, the above argument does not apply to correlation functions of fields that 
are gauge covariant. For example, (DI ~ (xI)1jJ(X2)ID) in general will depend on~. A simple 
example is (DIAf1>(x)Av(y)ID), which (at leading order) is just the ~-dependent photon 
propagator. That the S-matrix is gauge invariant, a fact that was understood in perturbation 
theory in Section 9.4, requires additional insight. A proof valid to all orders in perturbation 
theory using a different approach is discussed in Section 14.8.4. 
14.6 Fermionic path integral 
A path integral over fermions is basically the same as for bosons, but we have to allow for 
the fact that the fermions anticommute. At the end of the day, all you really need to use 
is that classical fermion fields satisfy {1f!(X) , x(y)} = O. This section gives some of the 
mathematics behind anticommuting classical numbers. 
A Grassmann algebra is a set of objects 9 that are generated by a basis {Bi}. These 
fJi are Grassmann numbers, which anticommute with each other, BiBj = -BjBi , add 
commutatively, Bi + Bj = Bj + Bi , and can be multiplied by complex numbers, aB E 9 for 
fJ E 9 and a E C. The algebra must also have an element 0 so that Bi + 0 = Bi. 
For one B, the most general element of the algebra is

Path integrals 
------------------------------~-----------------------~ 
and so on. Elements of the algebra that have an even number of Bi commute with all ele, 
ments of the algebra, so they compose the even-graded or bosonic sub algebra. Similarly, 
the odd-graded or fermionic sub algebra has an odd number of Bi and anticommutes within 
itself (but commutes with the bosonic subalgebra). The fermionic sub algebra is not closed 
since Bl B2 is bosonic. 
' 
Sometimes it is helpful to compare what we will do with fermions to an example of a 
Grassmann algebra that you might already be familiar with: the exterior algebra of dif-
ferential forms. Two forms A and B form a Grassmann algebra with the product USually 
denoted with a wedge, so that A A B = -B A A. So, for example, dx and dy would 
generate a two-dimensional Grassmann algebra. 
In physics our Grassmann numbers will be Bl = 'ljJ(xI) , B2 = 'ljJ(X2) , ... , so we will 
have an infinite number of them. Then quantities such as the Lagrangian are (bosonic) 
elements of g. To get regular numbers out, we need to integrate over V'ljJ. So we need to 
figure out a consistent way to define such integrals. 
To begin, we want integration to be linear, so that 
J 
dB l ··· dBn(sX+tY) = s.f dB l ··· denX+t J 
dB1··· dBnY, 
s, t E <C, 
X, Y E 9. 
(14.87) 
We do not put limits of integration on the integrals since there is only one Grassmann 
number in each direction. These are the analogs of the definite integrals, J~oo dx f(x), in 
the bosonic case. 
Next, we want the integrals to be like sums so that dB, like B, is an anticommuting object, 
and so is J dB. First consider one B. The most general integral is 
j de(a + bB) = a j de + b j dB B. 
(14.88) 
Since the integral is supposed to be a map from 9 to <C, the first term must vanish. We 
conventionally define J dB B = 1 and so 
jdB(a+bB)=b. 
Note that the obvious definition for derivatives is 
d 
dB (a + bB) = b, 
so integration and differentiation do the same thing on Grassmann numbers. 
For more Bi we define 
so that 
j dB1 ... dBnBn . . . B1 = 1. 
Note that we evaluate these nested integrals from the inside out. That is, 
j dB l dB2B2B1 = - j dB1dB2B1B2 = 1.

(14.94) 
where X is any element of 9 that is constant with respect to e: %(}X = O. This equality 
then holds by definition of integration. 
For the path integral, we need Gaussian integrals. For two ei , we have 
J

dBl dB2(1 - A l20l ( 2) = A l2 , 
(14.95)

If we think of Aij as a matrix, this is a sum over all elements {i, j} where we choose each 
row and column once, with the sign from the ordering. This is exactly how you compute a 
determinant. The n! for the number of permutations cancels the ~ in front. So 
n. 
J

(14.98) 
Note that this is different from what we found for ordinary numbers: 
(14.99) 
In the literature, authors often talk about general functions I(fh, fh, ... ), which are defined from their Taylor 
series. This notation does not mean I is a function in the usual sense, but rather that I is an element of the 
algebra generated by the Bi. This general notation is not particularly useful, and in the same way trying to 
decipher general functions I( dx, dy) is usually unnecessary. 
271 

272 
Path integrals 
---------------------------------------------------------~ 
Whether the determinant is in the numerator or denominator is occasionally important (bUt 
not for QED). With external cun-ents 'rJi and i'ii, 
J 
dBl ... dBnd(h ... dBne- OiAij()jHi;(),+iJi1Ji = /iA - 'ii J 
d8diie-(O-i;A - l)A(e-A - liJ) 
= det(A)ei;A -Iii, 
(14.100) 
which is all we need for the path integral. 
Now let us take the continuum limit, replacing the index i by a continuous variable x 
and ~i by 'l/J(x) and ~ by;j;(x). Then functions of Bi and Bi become functionals of'l/J(x) 
and 'l/J (x). The fermionic path integral is over all such fields : 
(14.101) 
As in the bosonic case, the ic comes from the boundary condition at t = ±oo. Then we 
have A = -i(if/J - m + ic) and so 
Z[i}, 'rJ] = N ei J d4x J d4Yi/(Y)(i$-m+ig)-lry(x) , 
where N = det( if/J - m) is some infinite constant. 
The 2-point function in the free theory is 
= J d
4
p 
i 
e -ip(x-y) 
(21f-)4 p - m + ic 
. 
This simplifies using (p - m) (p + m) = p2 - m 2, which implies 
1 
p+m 
p - m + ic 
p2 - m 2 + ic . 
So, 
(OIT{'l/J(x)-0(y)}IO) = J d

i(p + m). e-ip(x - y) , 
(27r)4 p2 - m 2 + Zc 
which is the Dirac propagator.

(14.105) 
Fermionic path integrals may seem really hard and confusing, but in the end they 
are quite simple, and you can usually forget about the fact that there is a lot of weird 
mathematics going into them. 
14.7 Schwinger-Dyson equations 
One odd thing about the path integral is that it only involves classical fields. Where is 
the quantum mechanics? Where is the non-commutativity? We saw in Section 7.1 that an

they are enough to completely . pecify the quantum theory. We wi ll al 0 how that these 
equation follow from the path inlcgr~tI and therefore they can be 1I ed to prOve that the 
canonical alld pa.th integral approache agree. Keep ill mind lhat the classical field in 
the path integral are not classical in the sense that they satisfy the classical equations of 
motion. In the path integral, one just integrates over all field configurations, whether or not 
they satisfy the equations of motion. 
14.7.1 Contact terms 
Since the contact terms in the Schwinger-Dyson equations indicate how the quantum field 
theory deviates from the corresponding classical field theory, it is natural to suspect that 
they are related to how the principle of least action is modified. In classical field theory, 
the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived by requiring that the action be stationary under 
variations ¢(x) ........ ¢(x) + c(x), where c(x) is an arbitrary function. Let us now investigate 
how the derivation is modified in the quantum theory. In this section, we take m = 0 for 
simplicity. 
Consider first the I-point function: 
(14.107) 
Now replace ¢( x) ........ ¢( x) + c( x) in the path integral. This is just a field redefinition, 
and since the path integral integrates over all configurations, the same answer must result. 
Since this is a linear shift, the measure is invariant, so 
(¢(x)) = _1_ Jv¢eifd4y(-~(<P+c)O(<P+c)) [¢(x) + c(x)] . 
Z[Q]

V¢eiJd4y( - H Dy</» { ¢(x) + c(x) - i¢(x) J 
d4zc(z)Dz ¢(z)} , 
(14.109) 
where we have integrated by parts to combine the cD¢ and ¢Dc terms. Comparing With 
Eq. (14.107), the ¢(x) term already saturates the equality, so the remaining terms must add 
to zero. Thus, 
Since the path integral does not depend on z except through the field insertion, the D z can 
be pulled outside of the integral. For the equality to hold for any c (z), we must have 
. 2 (

) I

(- ~) 
Dz 8J(z)8J(x) 
J = O = -~O (z - x) Z[O]. 
(14.111) 
In terms of correlation functions, this is 
(14.112) 
which is of course nothing but the Green's function equation for the Feynman propagator. It 
is also the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the 2-point function in a free scalar field theory. 
For an interacting theory, let us add a potential so that £ = -~¢D¢ + £int[¢]. Then 
the classical equations of motion are D¢ = £:nt [¢]. In the path integral, the addition of the 
potential contributes a term i J d4 Z c(z )£:nl [¢(z)] to the {} in Eq. (14.109) and Eq.(14.110) 
is modified to 
J 
d4zc(z) {Dz J 
V ¢ [eiS¢(z)¢(x)] 
-J 
V¢eis¢(x)£:nM(z)] + io4(z - x) J 
V¢eiS } = 0, 
(14.113) 
This can be written as a statement about correlation functions in the canonical picture: 
(14.114) 
which is the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the 2-point function in the presence of 
interactions. 
If we have more field insertions, the Schwinger-Dyson equations add contact inter-
actions, contracting the field on which the operator acts with all the other fields in the 
correlator. For example, with three fields: 
Dx(¢(x) ¢(y) ¢(z)) = (£:nt [¢(x)] ¢(y)¢ (z )) - io4(x - z)(¢(y) ) - io4 (x - y) (¢(z)) 
(14.115) 
and so on. In this way, the complete set of Schwinger-Dyson equations can be derived. 

14.7 Schwinger-Dyson equations 
SiJ1lilar equ~tions hold for theories with spinors or gauge bosons. For example, write the 
QBD Lagrangian as 
1 
-

L = 2AILOILV Av + 'ljJ (i$ - m)'ljJ - eAIL'ljJ'YIL'ljJ, 
(14.116)

the correlation function (A"''ljJ'ljJ) we would find 
D~v(Av(x)Aa(y)?,b(Zl) 'ljJ(Z2)) 
= eUIL(x)AO:(y)?,b(zd 'ljJ(Z2)) - io4(x - y) O~(?,b( Zl) 'ljJ(Z2))' 
(14.117) 
Another Schwinger-Dyson equation, for QED, is 
(i,~p81L + moKp) (i/JK(X) 'ljJo:(y)i/J(3(z)'ljJ,(w)) = -e(i/JK(x).;/J.KP'ljJo:(y) i/J(3(z)'ljJ,(w)) 
- iO,p04(x - w)('ljJa(Y) i/J(3(z)) - iOo:p04(x - y) ('ljJ,(w)i/J(3(z)), 
(14.118) 
with the minus sign coming from anticommuting ?,b(3(z) past 'ljJ'Y(w) in the last term. 
14.7.2 Schwinger-Dyson differential equation 
One has to be very careful going back and forth between the time-ordered products and path 
integrals. For example, the Schwinger-Dyson equation in Eq. (14.114) does not imply 
In fact, the left-hand side of this equation is zero, since 0 z only acts on ¢(z). The cor-
rect relationship is Eq. (14.113). To avoid confusion, it is safest not to go back and forth 
between the pictures, but rather to express the Schwinger-Dyson equations as expres-
sions relating observables, which can then be compared. The natural way to codify the 
observables is through the generating functional, which can be defined in both pictures. 
Let us then repeat the path integral derivation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation above 
for the generating functional based on the scalar Lagrangian L[¢] = -~¢O¢ + LinM]. 
Shifting ¢(y) ---+ ¢(y) + E(y) we find 
Z[J] = J V¢eiJd4y( -!CHc)DCcP+E)+L;o,[HEl+JHJE) 
= J V¢eiJd4Y£[1>l+J1> [l+iJ d4xE(X) ( - Ox¢(X) + 8~¢n[llf] +J(X)) +O(c2 )] . 
(14.120) 
As before, this should equal Z[J] for any E(Z). Thus, 
Ox J V¢eiJ d4Y£[1>l+J1>¢(x) = J V¢eiJ d
4 y£[1>l+J1> 8~¢n[~f] + J V¢eiJ d
4 y£ [1>l+J1> J(x) .

-
~Dx aJ(x) =

Z J , 
(14. 122) 
which is the Schwinger-Dyson differential equation. The slick notation .ernt [ ~ 
] , 
which means the functional .e'[X] taking X = 
aJ(~) as an argument, will be clatified 
below. 
An amazing thing about the Schwinger-Dyson differential equation is that, since it 
encodes the difference between the classical and quantum theories, it can be used to define 
the quantum theory. Therefore, it can be used to prove that the path integral and canonical 
approaches at'e equivalent. In particular, it can be used to define the generating functional: 
Z[ J] is the unique solution to this differential equation (with appropriate boundary Con-
ditions). Since Z[ J] defines all of the correlation functions, which define the theory, the 
Schwinger-Dyson differential equation also defines the theory. 
To show that the Schwinger-Dyson equation holds in the canonical theory, we first 
define a generating function ZP] by 
(14.123) 
Here, J(x) is an arbitrary classical current, but now ¢(x) is the quantum operator. This 
generates the correlation functions as well: 
A 
A 
1 
an Z 
I 
(¢;(Xl) ... ¢;(xn)) = Z[J] (_i)n aJ(xd'" aJ(xn) J=O 
(14.124) 
exactly as Z[J]. Thus, if we show that Eq. (14.122) holds for Z[J] and for Z[J], we have 
shown that Z[J] = Z[J], which shows that the path integral and canonical definitions 
agree. 
To demonstrate that Eq. (14.122) holds in the canonical theory, start with the Schwinger-
Dyson equations in Eq. (14.106) and insert factors of J at the same points as the field 
insertions. This gives 
D(¢(X)¢(Yl)'" ¢(Yn)J(Yl)'" J(Yn)) = (.ernt [¢(x)] ¢(yd'" ¢(Yn)J(Yl)'" J(Yn)) 
-i L 04(X - Yj)(¢(Yl) ... ¢(Yj-l)¢(Yj+l)'" ¢(Yn)J(Yl) ' " J(Yn))· 
(14.125) 
What we will show is that each term in this expression is in one-to-one correspondence 
with the Taylor expansion of Eq. (14.122). To show this, we need the expansion of the 
generating functional: 
Z[J] = (1 + i 1 
¢(y)J(y) + i
21 r ¢(y)J(y)¢(z)J(z) + ... ), 
y 
2 
y}z 
(14.126) 
where fy means f d4y. This expansion can be used for either the path integral or the 
canonical definition of the generating functional. 

14.8 Ward-Takahashi identity

A 
- iO oJ(x) = O(¢(x) + i¢(x) J
y 
¢(y)J(y) + ... ). 
(14.127) 
ThiS is the sum of all possible terms on the left-hand side of Eq. (14.125). 
for the lfnt term in Eq. (14.122), Schwinger's slick notation lfnt [aJ(~)] can be best 
derstood with an example. Suppose lint[¢] = -3
g, ¢3, then l(nM] = ~¢2 and so 
un 
. 
lint [ o~~~ )] Z [J] 
== t (o~~~) r (-.. + ~~ 11 L 
¢(y)J(y)¢(z)J(z)¢(w)J(w) + ... ), 
(14.128) 
where only one term is shown. Applying the !1J this becomes 
lint' [o~~~)] Z[J] = (- .. + i~!¢2(X) L 
¢(w)J(w) + ... ). 
(14.129) 
Then, since the full interacting quantum operator satisfies O¢ = lint' [¢], the expression 
simplifies to 
lint'[o~~~)] Z[J] = (- .. +iO¢(x) L 
¢(w)J(w)+···), 
(14.130) 
which is a sum of terms given by the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (14.125). 
Finally, 
J(x)Z[J] = (J(x) + iJ(x) 1 
¢(y)J(y)) 
= (L J(w - x)J(w) + i L 1J(w - x)J(w)¢(y)J(y) + ... ), 
(14.131) 
which has all the terms on the second line of Eq. (14.125). So each term in the expansion 
ofEq. (14.122) is verified and therefore Eq. (14.122) holds. 
Since the Schwinger-Dyson differential equation holds for both the path integral Z[J] 
and the canonically defined Z[J], Eq. (14.123), the two generating functionals must be 
identical. Thus, the path integral and canonical quantization are equivalent. 
By the way, you often hear that the canonical approach is purely perturbative. That is 
not true, since Z[J] is identical to Z[J]. Although non-perturbative statements can be made 
with the canonical approach, they are generally easier to make with path integrals, which 
is a practical distinction, not one of principle. 
14.8 Ward-Takahash i identity 
Recall that in the derivation of Noether's theorem, in Section 3.3, we performed a variation 
of the field that was also a global symmetry of the Lagrangian. This led to the existence 
277 

278 
Path integrals 
---------------------------------------------------------~ 
of a classically conserved cunent. Performing a similar variation on the path integral and 
following the steps that led to the Schwinger-Dyson equations will produce a general and 
powerful relation among correlation functions known as the Ward-Takahashi identity. The 
Ward-Takahashi identity not only implies the usual Ward identity and gauge invariance 
but since it is non-perturbative it will also play an important role in the renormalizatio~ 
of QED. 
14.8.1 Schwinger-Dyson equations for a global symmetry -
Consider the correlation function of 'IjJ(xl);fi(X2) in a theory with a global symmetry under 
'IjJ --> eia'IjJ: 
h2 = ('IjJ(xd i[;(X2)) = J 
V'ljJVi[;exP(i J 
d4X[i[;(i~ + m)'IjJ + ... ]) 'IjJ(Xl)i[;(X2), 
(14.l32) 
where the ... represent any globally symmetric additional terms. We do not need the 
photon, but you can add it if you like. Under a field redefinition which is a local 
transformation, 
(14.133) 
the measure is invariant. The Lagrangian is not invariant, since we have not transformed 
AJ.L (or even included it). Instead, 
(14.134) 
and 
(14.135) 
Since the path integral is an integral over all field configurations 'IjJ and 1[;, it is invariant 
under any redefinition, including Eq. (14.133) (up to a Jacobian factor, which in this case 
is just 1). Thus, expanding to first order in a, as in the derivation of the Schwinger-Dyson 
equations for a scalar field, 
0= J 
V'IjJ v i[; eiS [i J 
d4x i[;(x)ryJ.L 'IjJ(x) OJ.La(X)] 'IjJ(Xl)i[; (X2)

which implies 
J

V'IjJ vi[; eiS'IjJ(xl) i[;(X2). 
(14.137) 
That this equality must hold for arbitrary a( x) implies 
0J.L (jJ.L(x )'IjJ(xd i[;(X2)) = - 8(x - xd ('IjJ(Xl) i[;(X2)) + 8(x - X2) ('IjJ(xd i[;(X2)) ,

Photon fields AV have no effect since they are not charged and the interaction AIJ.7[;"(IJ.'IjJ is 
invariant under Eq. (14.l33). More importantly, the kinetic term for the photon also has no 
effect, thus these equations are independent of gauge-fixing. 
14.8.2 Ward-Takahashi identity 
To better understand the implications of Eg. (14.l38), it is helpful to Fourier transform. We 
first define a function MIJ.(p, ql, q2) by the Fourier transform of the matrix element of the 
CUl1'ent with fields: 
MIJ.(p, ql, q2) = J 
d4x d4xl d4x2 eipxeiQlxle- iQ2x2 (j1J.(x) 'IjJ(xd i[;(X2)).

(14.143) 
This is known as a Ward-Takahashi identity. It has important implications. In Sec-
tion 19.5, we will show that it implies that charge conservation survives renormalization, 
Which is highly non-trivial. The reason it is so powerful is that it applies not just to S-matrix 
elements, but to general correlation functions. It also implies the regular Ward identity, as 
We will show below.

One can give a diagrammatic interpretation of Ward-Takahashi identity: 
PJ.' ( 
ql ~ 
q~
) =

~~............... 
q,+p 
q2 
.. . .. 
(14.144) 
Here, the ® represents the insertion of momentum through the current. Note that these 
are not Feynman diagrams for S-matrix elements since the momenta are not on-shell. 
Instead, they are Feynman diagrams for correlation functions, also sometimes called 
off-shell S-matrix elements. The associated Feynman rules are the Fourier transforms of 
the position-space Feynman rules. Equivalently, the rules are the usual momentum space 
Feynman rules with the addition of propagators for external lines and without the external 
polarizations (that is, without removing the stuff that the LSZ formula removes). Momen_ 
tum is not necessarily conserved, which is why we can have ql +p coming in with q2 going 
out for general ql, P and q2. 
For correlations function with f fermions and b currents, the matrix element can be 
defined as 
M I1V1 .. • Vb(p,Pl·· 'Pb,ql" ·qf) 
= J 
d4xeipx eip,x'e-iq,y, ... (jJ.'(x)r'(xd·· . {J(yd ... ) 
(14.145) 
and the contractions as 
MVl ... Vb(p,Pl ··· Pb, ql ... qf) = J 
d4x eip,x'e-iq,y, ... (r' (xd" . {J(yd ... ). 
(14.146) 
Then, the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity is 
iPJ.'MJ.'Vl",Vb (p,Pl ... Pb, ql ... qf) = L QiMVl ···Vn(Pl, ... , qi - p, . .. , qf) 
outgoing 
- L QiMVl···Vn(Pl, ... , qi + p, ... , qf)· 
incoming 
(14.147) 
This sum is over all places where the momentum of the current can be inserted into one of 
the fermion lines. There are no terms where the momentum of the current goes out through 
another current, since currents jJ.' = {J(x lrJ.''ljJ(x) are gauge invariant and do not contribute 
to the Schwinger-Dyson equation. 
14.8.3 Ward identity 
Now let us connect the Ward-Takahashi identity to the normal Ward identity. Recall that 
the Ward identity is the requirement that if we replace EJ.' by PJ.' in an S-matrix element 
with an external photon, we get O. The basic idea behind the proof is that the S-matrix 
involves objects such as EJ.'O(AJ." .. ). By the Schwinger-Dyson equations, we can use 
OAJ.' = JJ.' up to contact terms to write EJ.'O(AJ.') = EJ.' (JJ.' ... ); then replacing EJ.' --t PI' 
gives zero since 8J.' (JJ." .. ) = 0 on-shell, by the Ward-Takahashi idenity. The tricky part

where the· .. are for the other particles involved in the scattering; DJ.l1/ here is shorthand 
for the photon kinetic terms. For example, in covariant gauges 
(14.149) 
Whether the photon is gauge-fixed or not will not affect the following argument. 
To simplify Eq. (14.148) we next use the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the photon: 
O~,60J.lI/(AI/(x) ... A(3 (Xk)"') = D~(3 [UJ.l(X) ... A(3(Xk)"') - iJ4(x - Xk) 9J.l(3("')] 
= UJ.l(x)· ·· ja(Xk)"') + D~aODF(x,xk)(-")' 
(14.150) 
where we have replaced -it54(x -
Xk) = OD F(X, Xk) on the second line to connect to the 
perturbation expansion, as in Section 7.1. The first term represents the replacement of the 
photon fields by currents. The second term represents a contraction of two external photons 
with each other. In diagrams: 
= 
(14.151) 
where the ® indicate current insertions. Since the contraction of two external photons gives 
a disconnected Feynman diagram, it does not contribute to the S-matrix. Thus, 
(14.152) 
This result is a very general and useful property of diagrams involving photons: 
S-matrix elements involving photons in QED with the external polarizations removed 
are equal to time-ordered products involving currents. 
281

L-~==~ --------------------------------------------~ 
This is also true for 8 -matrix elements in which the external momenta Pi are not assUllled 
to be on-shell. 
If we then replace the polarization Eet in Eq. (14.148) by the associated photon's 
momentum Pet' we find

(14.153) 
where mi are the masses of the fermions q; = m; and Meta···ab is given by Eq. (14.145). 
Using the Ward-Takahashi identity, Eq. (14.147), this becomes 
j 
(14.154) 
In terms of diagrams, we have found 
+ ... + 
(14.155) 
To get these diagrams, we first replace the external photons by currents, as in Eq. (14.151), 
and then remove the current associated with the photon with polarization Eet and feed its 
momentum pet into each of the possible external fermions, as dictated by Eq. (14.147). 
Now, each term in the sum in Eq. (14.154) has a pole at (qi ± p)2 = m;, not at q;-m;, 
2 
2 
and will vanish when multiplied by the prefactor gi - mi = 
ii~:: since qi is on-shell. 
Therefore, the sum vanishes and the Ward identity is proven. Note that this proof is non-
perturbative, and holds whether or not the external photons are assumed to have p2 = 0 
or not. 
By the way, the above derivation used that the photon interacted with the Noether current 
linearly. That is, that the interaction is Lint = ejet Aw This is not true for scalar QED, 
where the interaction is Lint = ieAet [¢* (°et¢) - (0et¢*)¢] + e2 A~I¢12 (cf. Eq. (9.11)). In 
scalar QED one can therefore have contractions of photons with other photons that do not

RENORMALIZATION 


NoW we come to the real heart of quantum field theory: loops. Loops generically are 
infinite. For example, the vacuum polarization diagram in scalar QED is

(15.2) 
This kind of divergent integral appears in almost every attempt to calculate matrix elements 
beyond leading order in perturbation theory: conections to the electron mass, conections 
to the hydrogen atom energy levels, etc. Even by the late 1930s, Dirac, Bohr, Oppenheimer 
and others were ready to give up on QED because of these divergent integrals. 
So what are we supposed to do about these divergences? The basic answer is very sim-
ple: this loop is not by itself measurable. As long as we are always computing measurable 
quantities, the answer will come out finite. In practice, the way it works is a bit more 
complicated - instead of computing a physical observable all along, we deform the theory 
in such a way that the integrals come out finite, depending on some regulating parame-
ter. When all the integrals are put together, the answer for the observable turns out to be 
independent of the regulator and the regulator can be removed. This is the program of 
renormalization. Why it is called "renormalization" will become clear in Chapter 18. 
15.1 Casimir effect 
Let us start with the simplest divergence, the one in the free Hamiltonian. Recall that for 
a free scalar field, which is just the sum of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators, the 
Hamiltonian is 
(15.3) 
kl' » pI" can be made precise by analytically continuing to Euclidean space, where it implies I k~ I » Ip~ I. 
For scaling arguments, we will more simply treat all the components of kl' as larger than all the components 
of pI' when considering such limits.

known as the zero-point energy. 
While the zero-point energy is infinite, it is also not observable. As with potential energy 
in classical mechanics, only energy differences matter and the absolute energy is unphysi_ 
cal (with the exception of the cosmological constant, to be discussed in Section 22.7.1). To 
get physics out of the zero-point energy we must consider the free theory in some context 
other than just sitting there in the vacuum. 
Consider the zero-point energy in a box of size a. If the energy changes with a, then We 
can calculate F = -
~! ' which will be a force on the walls of the box. In this case, we 
have a natural low-energy or infrared (IR) cutoff: If I > ~. Of course, this does not cut off 
the high-energy or ultraviolet (UV) divergence at large k, but if we are careful there will 
be a finite residual dependence on a that will give an observable force, called the Casimir 
force. 
Being careful, we realize immediately that if we change a then the energy inside and 
outside the box will change, which means we have to deal with all space again, compli-
cating the problem. So let us put in a third wall on our box far away, at L » a. Then the 
zero-point energy completely outside the box is independent of a, so we can immediately 
drop it. The setup is shown in Figure 15.1. 
We will work with a one-dimensional box for simplicity, and use a scalar field instead 
of the photon. In a one-dimensional box of size r the (classically) quantized frequencies 
are Wn = 
~n. Then the integral in the quantum Hamiltonian becomes a discrete (but still 
infinite) sum:2 
E(r) = (0 IHI 0) = L ~n ) 
n 
which represents the energy in a box of size r. 
7r 
Wn = -n, 
r 
(15.5) 
2 Continuous modes are normalized as [ab at] = (21r)3 03(p - k). For the Casimir force, the modes will be 
discrete, so [ak, at] = 0pk is appropriate. Then the Hamiltonian, H = J (~:)3 Wi (atap + apat), reduces 
to Eq. (15.3). 

15.2 Hard cutoff 
Tbe total energy is the sum of the energy on the right side, r = (L - a), plus the energy 
the left side, r = a: 
on 
Etot(a) = E(a) + 
E(L - a) = (~+ _1_) ~ ~ 
n. 
(15.6) 
a 
L - a 
2 6 
n =l 
We do not expect the total energy to be finite, but we do hope to find a finite value for the 
force: 
F(a) = - dElot = (~ -

(L - a)2

for L --' 00 this becomes 
71' 1 
F(a) = - -
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... ) = 00 . 
2 a2 
(15.7) 
(15.8) 
So tbe plates are infinitely repulsive. Needless to say, our prediction at this point does not 
agree with experiment. 
What are we missing? Physics! These boundaries at 0, a and L are forcing the 
electromagnetic waves to be quantized due to the interactions between the photons and 
the boundary plates. These plates are made of atoms. Now think about the super-high-
energy radiation modes, with super-small wavelengths. They are going to just plow through 
the walls of the box. Since we are only interested in the modes that are affected by the 
walls, these ultra-high-frequency modes should be irrelevant. The free theory is a little too 
idealized: without interactions, nothing can ever be measured. 
15.2 Hard cutoff 
Instead of putting in the detailed physics of the plates, it is easier to employ effec-
tive approximations. As we will see, all approximations that take into account certain 
gross properties of the interactions will be equivalent, providing a valuable lesson about 
renormalization. 
Say we put in a high-frequency cutoff A so that w < 71' A. We can think of A as t 
1 . 
, 
a OITllC size 
or some other natural scale that limits the high-frequency light. Then 
(15.9) 
So, 
E (r) = ~ ~ ~~ n = ~

n=l 
Then 
Eta! = E(L - a) + E (a) = ~ (A2 L + 2A) . 
(15.11) 
So, we get some infinite constant, but one that is independent of a. Thus F(a) = _d;Jaot 
:::: O. Now the force is no longer infinite, but vanishes. Is that the right answer?

The total energy with a floor-function cutoff does depend on a. The smooth line is the 
average of the oscillations, with - ~x(l - x ) --> - f2' as explained in the text. The dashed 
line on top is the large L limit of the hard cutoff energy, ~ A 2 L. The values A = 4 and 
L = 1000 have been used. 
Yes, to leading order. But we were a little too quick with this calculation. The hard cutoff 
means a mode is either included or not. Thus, even though we change r continuously, 
n m ax can only change by discrete amounts. We can write this mathematically with a floor 
function 
where l x J means the greatest integer less than x. Then the sum is 
7r 
E(r) = -lAr J(lAr J+l). 
4r 
(15.12) 
(15.13) 
Now the total energy, E tot(a) = E(L - a) + E(a), oscillates with a, as shown in 
Figure 15.2, and we see that total energy is not a smooth function of a. 
To deal with this oscillation, define a number x as 
x= Aa-lAaJ E [0,1), 
(15.14) 
which gives 
7r[ 
X(l-X)] 
E(a) = "4 A2a+A -2Ax-
a 
. 
(15.15) 
We will also take AL to be an integer, which is allowed because L was some arbitrary fixed 
size that does not change when we move the wall at a. Then l AL - Aa J = AL - I Aa 1· 
For simplicity, let us also assume Aa is not an integer, which lets us use I Aa 1 = l Aa J + 1. 
Then, 
(15.16) 

15.3 Regulator independence 
(15.17) 
he A2 L piece is the extrinsic energy of the whole system, which does not contribute to 
~e force, and a part that oscillates as x goes between 0 and 1. Keeping only terms up to 
order L 0 , the total energy is 
Jr 
2 
Jr 
Etot(a) = "4LA - 4a x(l - x). 
(15.18) 
The J LA2 term is the extrinsic energy, which does not contribute to the force, and a part 
that oscillates as 0 :s; x < l. 
Since x = Aa - l Aa J, as A ----; 00 at fixed a, there are more and more oscillations. In 
the continuum limit (A ----; 00), the plate will only experience the average force. Thus, we 
can average x between 0 and 1, using J x(l - x) = i. So, 
Jr 
2 
Jr 
Etot(a) :::::J "4LA - 24a· 
(15.19) 
This average is shown as the smooth line in Figure 15.2. 
The result is a non-zero and finite result for the force: 
F(a) = _ dEtot = -~. 
da 
24a2 
(15.20) 
putting back in the nand c, we find that the Casimir force in one dimension is 
F(a) = -~:~ . 
(15.21) 
This is an attractive force. We can see that the force is purely quantum mechanical because 
it is proportional to n. 
In three dimensions, remembering to account for the two photon polarizations, the 
answer is 
F(a) = _ Jr
2nc A 
240a4 
' 
(15.22) 
where A is the area of the walls of the box. Although predicted by Casimir in 
1948 [Casimir, 1948], the force was not conclusively observed until 1997 [Lamoreaux, 
1997]. 
15.3 Regulator independence 
You should find the calculation of the Casimir effect incredibly disconcerting. We found 
the force to be independent of A, but we needed to use a crazy model of the walls where the 
discreteness of the hard cutoff played an important role. What if we took a different model 
291 

292 
The Casimir effect 
~----~ -----------------------------------------------------~ 
besides the hard cutoff for regulating the UV modes? It seems obvious that we should get 
a different answer with each model. 
However, it turns out we will not. We get the same answer no matter what, as long as the 
cutoff satisfies some basic requirements. That is a pretty amazing fact. We will first try a 
few more regulators, then we will present the precise requirements and a proof of regulator 
independence. 
15.3.1 Heat-kernel regularization 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another reasonable physical assumption besides a hard cutoff would be that there is sOllle 
penetration depth of the modes into the walls, with high-frequency modes getting further. 
This means that the contribution of high-frequency modes to the relevant energy SUlll is 
exponentially suppressed. Thus we can try 
(15.23) 
This is called heat-kernel regularization.

which is the same thing we found with the floor-function cutoff. Note, however, that the 
extrinsic energy term was i LA 2 in the previous case and is ~ LA 2 in this case. 

15.3 Regulator independence

What else can we try? We can use a Gaussian regulator: 
E(r) = ~ LWne-(~)2, 
(15.29) 
n 
or a (_function regulator: 
(15.30) 
where we take s ---t 0 instead of W max ---t 00 and have added an arbitrary scale p, to keep 
the dimensions correct. p, does not have to be large - it should drop out for any p,. 
Let us work out the (-function case. Substituting in for Wn we get

The Casimir effect 
-----------------------------------------------------~ 
15.3.3 Regulator-independent derivation 
------------------------------~-------------------------~ 
Casimir showed in his original paper [Casimir, 1948] a way to calculate the force in a 
regulator-independent way. Define the energy as 
E(a) = ~ '""" ~ f(~) , 
2 L..- a 
aA 
n 
where f(x) is some function whose properties we will determine shortly. 
With this definition, the energy of the L - a side of the box is 
7r 
2,""" 
n (n) 
E(L-a) = 2(L-a)A L..- (L-a)2A2 f (L-a)A . 
n 
We can take the continuum limit of this (L ----7 (0) with x = (L "'a) A . Th~n, 
E(L-a) = ~LA2 j xdxf(x) - ~aA2 j xdxf(x). 
The first integral is just the extrinsic vacuum energy, with energy density 
p = ~A2 j xdx f(x). 
05.39) 
(15.40) 
(15.41) 
(15.42) 
The second integral simplifies with the change of variables x = 
a~' Adding the discrete 
sum, for the a side, with the continuum limit of the L - a side, gives 
Etot=E(a)+E(L-a)=PL+;a[~nfC:)- jndnfC:)]· 
(15.43) 
This contains the difference between an infinite sum and an infinite integral. Such a 
difference is given by the Euler-Maclaurin series: 
N 
N 
~F(n) -10 F(n)dn 
F(O) + F(N)

F(j-l)(N) - F(j-l)(O) 
=

+ 
12 
+ ... + B j 
j! 
+ ... , 
(15.44) 
where F(j) (N) = 
dJ:~;r) and Bj are the Bernoulli numbers. In particular, B2 = i and 
B j for odd j > 1 happen to vanish. 
In our case, F(n) = nf(a~)' So, assuming that f(x) dies sufficiently fast, 
lim xf(j)(x) = 0, 
(15.45) 
x--+oo 
then 
7r f(O) 
B4 
37r 
/I 
Etot = pL -
24a - 4! 2a3A2f (0) + .... 
(15.46) 
For example, if f(x) = e-x , then 
E tot = ~A2 L - 2:a + O(a;A) , 
(15.47) 
which gives the correct Casimir force. 

15.3 Regulator independence 
In fact, it is now clear that any regulator will give this force as long as 
lim xf(jl(x) = 0 
and 
f(O) = l.

We have two conclusions from this analysis: 
The Casimir force is independent of any regulator. 
The Casimir force is an infrared effect. 
15.3.4 Counterterms 
In the above analysis, we not only took W max ~ 00 but also L ~ 00. Why did we need 
this third boundary at r = L at all? Let us suppose we did not have it, and just calculated 
the energy inside the box of size r. Then we would get (with the heat-kernel regulator) 
E(r) = ~rA2 - 2:r + .... 
(15.49) 
This first term is the extrinsic energy, which is linear in the volume and is regulator depen-
dent. It can be interpreted as saying there is some finite energy density P = ~ = ~ A2. 
Now suppose that instead of just the free-field Lagrangian £ we used to calculate the 
ground-state energy, we took 
£ = £' + Pc, 
(15.50) 
where Pc is constant. This new term gives an infinite contribution of J dx Pc in the action. 
Now if we choose Pc = 
_~A2, the new term exactly cancels the ~rA2 term we found 
lIsing the heat-kernel regulator. In the (-function regulator, where no divergent terms come 
Ollt of the calculation, we could take Pc = O. 
The point is that since Pc is unmeasurable we can choose it to be whatever is convenient. 
Pc is called a counterterm. Counterterms give purely infinite contributions to intermediate 
steps in calculations, but when we compute physical quantities they drop out. Counterterms 
are an important tool in renormalization in quantum field theory.

The Casimir effect 
------------------------------------------------------
or equivalently

1+2+3+ ···=--. 
12 
(15.52) 
This bizarre identity has an important use in string theory. In string theory, the mass of 
particles is determined by the string tension a': 
2 
1. 
m = ,J +Eo, 
a 
(15.53) 
where j is the excitation number (the string harmonic) and Eo is the Casimir energy of 
the string, which is independent of j. So there is a whole tower of particles with different 
masses. In d dimensions, the Casimir energy is 
Eo = ~(~) (-~) 
a' 
2 
12' 
(15.54) 
where the - /2 comes from the same series we have just summed. Now, you can show in 
string theory that the j = 1 excitations comprise spin-l particles with two polarizations. 
So they must be massless. Then, solving for m = 0 you find d = 26. That is why string 
theory takes place in 26 dimensions. If you do the same calculation for the superstring, you 
find d = 10. 
15.4 Scalar field theory example 
Before we do any physical calculations, let us get an overview of the way things are going 
to work out in quantum field theory. Consider the theory of a massless real scalar field with 
Lagrangian 
(15.55) 
where A is a dimensionless coupling constant. At tree-level, ¢¢ ----7 ¢¢ scattering is given 
by the simple cross diagram: 
iM,~ X ~-iA. 
(15.56) 
The leading correction comes from loops, such as this s-channel one: 
(15.57) 
There are also t- and u-channel diagrams, but let us forget about them (for example, if 
we had three fields with a ~(¢f¢~ + ¢~¢§) interaction, there would only be an s-channel 
contribution to ¢1 ¢1 ----7 ¢3¢3). 

15.4 Scalar field theory example 
Let P :== PI + P2 = P3 + P4, then kI + k2 = P so we can set kI = k and k2 = P - k and 
grate over k. The diagram is then

\1'0 
::: p2. It i ai, 0 di mensionless and diverges as J dkk . So we expect lvI2 ~ log -b, where

8s M2 (s) = 2s 8pJ1- M2 (s) = 2; 
(271')4 k2 (p _ k)4 . 
(15.59) 
NoW the integral is convergent. It is not too hard to work out this integral, and we will do 
some examples like this soon. But for now, we will just quote the answer: 
8 
).,2 1 
8S M2 (s) = - 3271'2~' 
(15.60) 
TlUs means that 
).,2 
M2 = ---lns+c 
1671'2 
) 
(15.61) 
where c is an integration constant. Since the integral in Eq. (15.58) is divergent, c will have 
to be infinite. Also, since s has dimensions of mass squared, it is nice to write the constant 
as c = 1 
~;2 In A 2, where A has dimensions of mass. Then we have 
.>-2 
s 
M2 = - 3271'2 In A2' 
(15.62) 
So the total matrix element is 
).,2 
S 
M(s) = -)., -
3271'2 In A2' 
(15.63) 
This is an analog of the Casimir energy, E tot (a) = cA 2 L -
2~a' which has A dependence 
and dependence on the physical scale (Vs or a). We now need the analog ofthe observable, 
the force on the plates in the Casimir calculation. 
15.4.1 Renormalization of .x 
First of all, notice that, while M( s) is infinite, the difference between M(SI) and M(S2) 
at two different scales is finite: 
(15.64) 
Should we also expect that M (s) itself be finite? After all, M2 is supposed to be a physical 
cross section. 
To answer this, let us think more about .>-. It should be characterizing the strength of the 
¢4 interaction. So to measure)., we would simply measure the cross section for ¢¢ ----7 ¢¢ 
SCattering, or equivalently, M. But this matrix element is not just proportional to .>- but also 
297 

298 
The Casimir effect 
-------------------------------------------------~ 
has the A 2 correction above. Thus, it is impossible to simply extract A from this scatterin 
process. Instead, let us just define a renormalized coupling AR as the value of the matri~ 
element at a particular S = So. 
So, 
A2 
So 
AR == -M(so) = A+ --In- + .... 
327f2 
A2 
(15.65) 
This equation relates the parameter A of the Lagrangian to the value of the observed SCat_ 
tering amplitude AR at a particular center-of-mass energy So. We can also conclude that 
since A R is observable and hence finite, A must be infinite, to cancel the infinity from In 11.2 
Next, we will solve for A in terms of AR in perturbation theory by writing 
A = AR +aA~ + ... 
(15.66) 
and solving for a. Substituting into Eq. (15.65) we find 
2 
A~ 
8 0 
= AR +aAR + --In- + .... 
327f2 
A2 
(15.67) 
So, a = - 32~2 Inp and 
(15.68) 
Although the second term may be larger than the first as A --+ 00, this should be thought 
of as a formal solution as a power series in AR. 
Now, suppose we measure the cross section at a different center-of-mass energy s. Then 
(15.69) 
This equation gives us an expression for M (s) for any s that is finite order-by-order in per-
turbation theory. More importantly it gives us a physical prediction. The ¢4 cross section 
with s = 81 differs from the cross section with s = So by logarithmic terms. Remember, 
by definition AR is observable: it is the exact cross section at the scale So. So we are pre-
dicting one observable (cross section at s) in terms of another (cross section at so). By the 
way, the logarithmic behavior is a characteristic of loop effects - tree-level graphs only 
give you rational polynomials in momenta and couplings, never logarithms. This will play 
an important role in proofs of renormalizability (Chapter 21) and in making predictions in 
non-renormalizable theories (Chapter 22). 

Problems 
15.4.2 Interpretation of counterterms 
other way of getting the same result is to add a counterterm to the Lagrangian. That 
Afl ns adding another interaction that is just like the first, but infinite. So we take as our 
J1lea

So 
(15.73) 
which is finite. In particular, this choice of 6), makes M(so) 
-AR, which was our 
definition of AR above. 
Doing things this way, with counterterms but as a perturbative expansion in the physical 
coupling AR, is known as renormalized perturbation theory. The previous way, where we 
compute physical quantities such as M (Sl) - M (S2) directly, is sometimes called physical 
or on-shell perturbation theory. The two are equivalent, but for complicated calculations, 
renormalized perturbation theory is often much easier. 
Problems 
15.1 Evaluate the Casimir force using the Gaussian regulator in Eq. (15.29). 
15.2 Show that the Casimir force from the vacuum energy of fermions has the opposite 
sign than from bosons. 
15.3 It has been proposed that geckos use the Casimir force to climb wans. It is known 
that geckos do not use suction (like salamanders) or capillary adhesion (like some 
frogs). A gecko's foot is covered in a million tiny hairs called setae, which terminate 
in spatula-shaped structures around 0.51-lm wide. Use dimensional analysis and the 
form of the Casimir force to decide whether you think this could be possible. 
15.4 The vacuum energy of massive particles also contributes to the Casimir force. Before 
doing the calculation, how do you expect the Casimir force to depend on mass? Now 
do the calculation and see if you are correct (use any approximations you want - this 
problem is challenging). 
299

In the previous chapter, we found that although the energy of a system involving two plates 
is infinite, the force between the plates (the Casimir force), which is what is actually 
observable, is finite. At an intermediate step in the calculation, we needed to model the 
inability of the plates to restrict ultra-high-frequency radiation. We found that the force 
was independent of the model and only determined by radiation with wavelengths of the 
plate separation, exactly as physical intuition would suggest. More precisely, we proved the 
force was independent of how we modeled the interactions of the fields with the plates as 
long as the very short wavelength modes were effectively removed and the longest wave_ 
length modes were not affected. Some of our models were inspired by physical arguments, 
as in a step-function cutoff representing an atomic spacing; others, such as the (-function 
regulator, were not. That the calculated force is independent of the model is very satisfy_ 
ing: macroscopic physics (the force) is independent of microscopic physics (the atoms). 
Indeed, for the Casimir calculation, it does not matter if the plates are made of atoms, 
aether, phlogiston or little green aliens. 
The program of systematically making testable predictions about long-distance physics 
in spite of formally infinite short-distance fluctuations is known as renormalization. 
Because physics at short and long distance decouples, we can deform the theory at short 
distance any way we like to get finite answers - we are unconstrained by physically jus-
tifiable models. In fact, our most calculationally efficient deformation will be analytic 
continuation to d = 4 -
E dimensions with E --+ O. The beauty of renormalization is 
that the existence of a physical cutoff is totally inelevant: quantitative predictions about 
long-distance physics do not care what the sholt-distance cutoff really is, or even whether 
or not it exists. 
The core idea behind renormalization in quantum field theory is: 
Observables are finite and in-principle calculable functions of other observables. 
One can think of general conelation functions (niT {¢(xd ... ¢(Xn )} In) as a useful 
proxy for observables. Most of the conceptual confusion, both historically and among 
students learning the subject, stems from trying to express observables in terms of 
non-observable quantities, such as coupling constants in a Lagrangian. In practice: 
• Infinite results associated with high-energy divergences may appear in intermediate stepS 
of calculations, such as in loop graphs. 
• Infinities are tamed by a deformation procedure called regularization. The regulator 
dependence must drop out of physical predictions. 

Vacuum polarization 
Coefficients of terms in the Lagrangian, such as coupling constants, are not observable. 
• '[hey can be solved for in terms of the regulator and will drop out of physical predictions. 
We will tind that loops can produce behavior different from anything possible at tree-level.

(j~'1 (1)4 ) so 1 n :0 + .... Although ¢>4 theory was just a toy example, 
renormalization in QED which we begin in this chapter, is conceptually identical. 
Recall that the Coulomb potential V (r) 
4~r is given by the exchange of a single 
photon: 
(16.1) 
Indeed, 4; r is just the Fourier transform of the propagator (cf. Section 3.4). A I-loop 
correction to Coulomb's law comes from an e+ C loop inside the photon line: 
~
. 
(16.2) 
This will give us a cOlTection to V (r) proportional to e4 . We will show that while the charge 
e is infinite it can be replaced by a finite renormalized charge order-by-order in pelturbation 
theory. The physical effect will be a measurable cOlTection to Coulomb's law predicted by 
quantum field theory with logarithmic scale dependence, as in the ¢>4 toy model. 
The process represented by the Feynman diagram in Eq. (16.2) is known as vacuum 
polarization. The diagram shows the creation of virtual e+ e- pairs, which act like a virtual 
dipole. In the same way that a dielectric material such as water would become polarized 
if we put it in a electric field, this vacuum polarization tells us how the vacuum itself is 
polarized when it interacts with electromagnetic radiation. 
Since the renormalization of the graph is no different than it was in ¢>4 theory, the only 
difficult part of calculating vacuum polarization is in the evaluation of the loop. Indeed, the 
loop in Eq. (16.2) is complicated, involving photons and spinors, but we can evauate it by 
exploiting some tricks developed through the hard work of our predecessors. Our approach 
will be to build up the QED vacuum polarization graph in pieces, starting with ¢>3 theory, 
then scalar QED, and finally real QED. For convenience, some of the more mathematical 
aspects of regularization are combined into one place in Appendix B, which is meant to 
provide a general reference. In the following, we assume familiarity with the results from 
that appendix.

which will tell us the I-loop correction to the Yukawa potential. We will allow the initial 
and final line to be off-shell: p2 i= m 2 , since we are calculating the correction to the initial 
¢ propagator, p2~m2' which also must have p2 i= m 2 to make any sense, and since we will 
be embedding this graph into a correction to Coulomb's law (see Eq. (16.14) below).

= [k - p(l - X)]2 + p2x(1 - x) - m 2 + iE,

An important point is that the regulator scale A has to be just a number, independent of 
any external momenta. With the Pauli-Villars regulator we are using here, A is the mass 
of some heavy fictitious particle. It corresponds to a deformation of the theory at very high 
energies/short distances, like the modeling of the wall in the Casimir force. On the other 
band, Q is a physical scale, like the plate separation in the Casimir force. Thus, A cannot 
depend on Q. In particular, the In Q2 dependence cannot be removed by a redefinition of 
A like the 2 in Eq. (16.11) was. This point is so important it is worth repeating: the short-
distance deformation (A) cannot depend on long-distance physical quantities (Q). This 
separation of scales is critical to being able to take A -+ 00 to make predictions by relating 
observables at different long-distance scales such as Q and Qo. The coefficient of In Q2 is 
in fact regulator independent and will generate the physical prediction from the loop. 
16.1.1 Renormalization 
The diagram we computed is a correction to the tree-level ¢ propagator. To see this, observe 
that the propagator is essentially the same as the t-channel scattering diagram: 
If we insert our scalar bubble in the middle, we get 
(. )2 i

Since p2 < 0, let us write Q2 = _p2 with Q > O. Then, 
M(Q) = MO(Q) + M1(Q) = ~: (1 - 3;1l"2 ~: In ~~ + 0(g4)) .

a
(16.16)
Then we can define a renormalized coupling gR at some fixed scale Qo by 
(16.17)
This is called a renormalization condition. It is a definition and, by definition, it hOlds
to all orders in perturbation theory. The renormalization condition defines the COUpling
in terms of an observable. Therefore, you can only have one renormalization condition
for each parameter in the theory. This is critical to the predictive power of quantum field
theory.

for external photons, we could contract the f.L and l/ indices with polarization vectors, but 
illstead we keep them free so that this diagram can be embedded in a Coulomb exchange 
diagram as in Eq. (16.14). This integral is the same as in ¢3 theory, except for the numerator 
factors. In scalar QED there is another diagram:

[(p - k)2 - m 2 + is][k2 - m 2 + is] 
(16.24) 
Fortunately, we do not need to evaluate the entire integral. By looking at what possible 
form it could have, we can isolate the part that will contribute to a correction to Coulomb's 
law and just calculate that part. By Lorentz invariance, the most general fonn that II~1I 
could have is 
(16.25) 
for some form factors ,0.1 and ,0.2. Note that II~1I cannot depend on k/1>, since k/1> is 
integrated over. 
As a correction to Coulomb's law, this vacuum polarization graph will contribute to 
the same process that the photon propagator does. Let us define the photon propagator in 
momentum space by 
(16.26) 
Note that this expression only depends on x - y by translation invariance. This is the all-
orders non-perturbative definition of the propagator G/1>11 (p), which is sometimes called the 
dressed propagator. At leading order, in Feynman gauge, the dressed propagator reduces 
to the free propagator:

Note that we are calculating loop corrections to a Green's function, not an S-matrix ele_ 
ment, so we do not truncate the external propagators and add polarization vectors. One 
point of using a dressed propagator is that once we calculate ,6,1 and ,6,2 we can just USe 
GJw (p) instead of the tree-level propagator in QED calculations to include the loop effect. 
Next note that the ,6,2 term is just a change of gauge - it gives a correction to the unphys_ 
ical gauge parameter ~ in covariant gauges. Since ~ drops out of any physical process, by 
gauge invariance, so will ,6,2. Thus we only need to compute ,6,1. This means extracting 
the term proportional to gl1>l/ in III1>I/. 
Most of the terms in the amplitude in Eq. (16.24) cannot give gl1>v. For example, the 
pl1>pV term must be proportional to pl1>pV and can therefore only contribute to ,6,2, so we can 
ignore it. For the pl1> kl/ term, we can pull pl1> out of the integral, so whatever the remaining 
integral gives, it must provide a pI/ by Lorentz invariance. So these terms can be ignored 
too. The kl1> kV term is important - it may give a pl1>pV piece, but may also give a gl1>l/ piece, 
which is what we are looking for. So we only need to consider 
IIl1>v = ie2 J d4k

A natural renormalization condition is that the potential between two particles at some 
2 
reference scale ro should be V(ro) == - 4:~o' which would define a renormalized eR. It is 
easier to continue working in momentum space and to define the renormalized charge as 
V (P6) == e~po2 exactly. So 
eh == P6V(P6) = e2 - e
4II2(P6) + .... 
(16.52) 
Solving for the bare coupling e as a function of eR to order ek gives 
(16.53) 
Since II2 (P6) is infinite, e is infinite as well, but that is OK since e is not observable.

The potential at another scale P, which is measurable, is 
p2V(p) = e2 - e4Ih(p2) + ... = eh - ek [Ih(p2) - II2(P6)] + .... 
For concreteness, let us take Po = 0, corresponding to r = 00, so that the renormalized 
electric charge agrees with the macroscopically measured electric charge. Then

bation expansion in terms of a small parameter eR, which is also finite. We will now stUdy 
some of the physical implications of this potential.

This agrees with the Coulomb potential up to a correction known as the Uehling term. 
What is the physical effect of this extra term? One way to find out is to plug this potential 
into the Schrodinger equation and see how the states of the hydrogen atom change. Equiv-
alently, we can evaluale the effect in time-independent perturbation theory by evaluating 
the leading-order energy shift b.E = (1fJi 16. VI1fJi) using 6. V = - 6o'::m2 o(r). Since only 
the L = 0 atomic orbital have upport at r = 0, this extra term will only affect the S 
states of the hydrogen atom. The energy is negative, so their energies will be lowered. You 
might recall that, at leading order, the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom is determined 
only by the ptincipal atomic number n, so the 2P1/2 and 281/ 2 levels (for example) are 
degenerate. Thus, the Uehling term contributes to the splitting of these levels, known as the 
Lamb shift. It changes the 281/ 2 state by -27 MHz, which is a measurable conttibution to 
the -1028 MHz Lamb shift.

"BY the way the mea urement of the Lamb hift in 1947 by Walli Lamb [Lamb and 
Retherford, 1947] was one of the key experiments that convinced people to take quan-
turn field theory seriously. Measurements of the hyperfine splitting between the 281/ 2 and 
ZP1/2 states of the hydrogen atom had been attempted for many years, but it was only 
by using microwave technology developed during the Second World War that Lamb was 
able to provide an accurate measurement. He found 6.E ~ 1000 MHz. Shortly after his 
rneasurement, Hans Bethe calculated the dominant theoretical contribution. His calcula-
tion was of a vertex correction that was IR divergent. Now we know that the IR divergence 
is canceled when all the relevant contributions are included, but Bethe simply cut off the 
divergence by hand at what he argued was a natural physical scale, the electron mass. His 
result was that 6.E = - z4fz
57fm e In( a 4 Z4) ~ -1000 MHz, in excellent agreement with 
Lamb's value. The next year, Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga all independently pro-
vided the complete calculation, including the Uehling term and the spin-orbit coupling. 
Due to a subtlety regarding gauge invariance, only Tomonaga got it right the first time. The 
full I-loop result gives E(28 1/ 2 ) - E(2P 1/ 2 ) = 1051 MHz. The current best measurement 
of this shift is 1054 MHz.

One way to write the radiative correction to the potential is 
(16.64) 
where 
e~ff(Q) = e~[l + 1~~21n~:] . 
(16.65) 
In this case, for simplicity, we have defined the renormalized charge, eR 
eeff(rn), at 
Q = m rather than at Q = O. (One could also define eR at Q = 0, as with the Uehling 
potential; however, then one would need to include the full m dependence to regulate the 
m = 0 singularity.) 
Equation (16.65) is to be interpreted as an effective charge in QED that grows as 
the distance gets smaller (momentum gets larger). Near any particular fixed value of the 
momentum transfer pI-', the potential looks like a Coulomb potential with a charge eeff (p2) 
instead of eR. This is a useful concept because the charge depends only weakly on p2, 
through a logarithm. Thus, for small variations of p around a reference scale, the same 
effective charge can be used. Equation (16.65) only comes into play when one compares 
the charge at very different momentum transfers. 
The sign of the coefficient of the In ~ term is very important; this sign implies that the 
effective charge gets larger at short distances. At large distances, the charge is increasingly 
screened by the virtual electron-positron dipole pairs. At smaller distances, there is less 
room for the screening and the effective charge increases. However, the effective charge 
2 
only increases at small distances very slowly. In fact, taking rY.R = * = 
1~7 so that 
eR = 0.303, we get an effective fine-structure constant of the form 
(16.66) 
Because the coefficient of the logarithm is nume11cally small, one has to measure the 
potential at extremely high energies to see its effect. In fact, only very few high-precision 
measurements are sensitive to this logarithm. 
Despite the difficulty of probing extremely high energies in QED experimentally, one 
can at least ask what would happen if we attempted scattering at Q » m. From Eq. (16.66) 
we can see that at some extraordinarily high energies, Q rv 10285 eV, the loop correction, 
the logarithm, is as important as the tree-level value, the 1. Thus, perturbation theory is 
breaking down. At these scales, the 2-100p value will also be as large as the I-loop and 
tree-level values, and so on. The scale where this happens is known as a Landau pole. So, 
QED has a Landau pole: perturbation theory breaks down at short distances.

16.3.3 Running coupling

It is not difficult to include certain higher-order cOlTections to the effective electric charge. 
Adding more loops in series, we can sum a set of graphs to all orders in the coupling 
constant:

(16.69) 
which is known as a running coupling. Note that we have defined this running coupling to 
have the same renormalization condition as the I-loop effective charge: eeff = eR at p2 = 
-m 2. Although the running coupling includes contributions from all orders in perturbation 
theory, it still has a Landau pole at p ~ 10286 eY. 
Running couplings will play an increasingly important role as we study more compli-
cated problems in quantum field theory. They are best understood through the renormal-
ization group. As a preview of how the renormalization group works, note that Eq. (16.69)

The renormalization group comes from the simple observation that there is nothing special 
about the renormalization point. Here we have defined eR = eeff(m), but we could have 
renormalized at any other point p,2 instead of m 2 , and the results would be the same. Then

Problems 
16.1 Calculate the p"'pv pieces of the vacuum polarization graph in scalar QED and in 
spinor QED. Show that your result is consistent with the Ward identity. 
16.2 Calculate the Uehling potential, Eq. (16.60), by Fourier transforming the effective 
potential. 
16.3 The pions, 7[" ± , are charged scalar quark-antiquark bound states (mesons) with 
masses of 139 MeV. The tauon is a lepton with mass 1770 MeV. Consider the con-
tribution of the vacuum polarization amplitude to 7["+7["- --+ 7["+7[" - through a virtual 
T loop in QED. For simplicity, consider the 8-channel contribution only. 
(a) Plot IMI2 as a function of 8 for forward scattering (t = 0). You should find a 
kink at 8 = 80. What is 80? What is going on physically when 8 > 80? 
(b) Plot the real and imaginary parts of M separately. Calculate Im(M) explicitly 
and show that it agrees with your plot. 
(c) Find a relationship between Im(M) at t = 0 and the total rate for 7["+7["- ~

acting on electron doublets l'lji), where § = !O'. This was derived in Problem 10.1. The 
coupling g is the g-factor of the electron, representing the relative strength of its intrinsic 
magnetic dipole moment to the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. From the point of view 
of the Schrodinger equation, g is a free parameter and could be anything. However, the 
Dirac equation implies that g = 2, which was a historically important postdiction in excel-
lent agreement with data when Dirac presented his equation in 1932. A natural question 
is then: is g = 2 exactly, or does g receive quantum corrections? The answer should not 
be obvious. For example, the charge of the electron is exactly opposite to the charge of the 
proton, receiving no radiative corrections (we will prove this in Section 19.5), so perhaps 
the magnetic moment is exact as well. By the late 1940s there were experimental data that 
could be partially explained by the electron having an anomalous magnetic moment, that 
is, one different from 2. The calculation of this anomalous moment by Schwinger, Feyn-
man and Tomonaga in 1948, and its agreement with data, was a triumph of quantum field 
theory. 
17.1 Extracting the moment 
We would like a way to extract the radiative corrections to g without having to take the 
non-relativistic limit. To see how to do this, recall from Section 10.4 how the electron's 
magnetic dipole moment was derived from the Dirac equation. Charged spinors satisfy 
(iJ~ - m)1fJ = O. Multiplying thi by i J/J + m) shows that charged pinors alliO satisfy 
(.I/P +rn2 )'I/J = O. We then u e the operator relation (cf. Eq. (10. 106))

which can be compared directly to Eq. (17.1) to read off the strength of the magnetic diPole 
interaction geE. B.l Since B = % for spin ~, we find again that 9 = 2. If Eq. (17.2) had 
g' ~ FJ1.vuJ1.V in it, we would have found 9 = g' instead. Thus, a general and relativistic way 
to extract conections to 9 is to look for loops that have the same effect as an additional 
FJ1.vuJ1.V term. 
A generally useful way to think about corrections to the way photons interact with 
spinors, such as conections to g, is to consider off-shell S-matrix elements. The Feyn-
man rules for off-shell S-matrix elements are the same as for on-shell S-matrix elements 
except that p; = m; for the various external states is not enforced. In this case, the rei evan; 
process is e - (qd Ai' (p) -+ e - (q2), with polarization vector E J1. (P) and two spinor states 
U(q2) and U(ql)' At tree-level, the matrix element isjust EJ1.Mb, where 
(17.5) 
with the photon momentum constrained by momentum conservation to be pJ1. = q~ - qi. 
This result actually contains 9 = 2 in it, although it is hard to see in. this form. We expect 
something equivalent to an FJ1.vuJ1.V term, which should look like u( q2) PvuJ1.V u( ql) in 
momentum space. To see where FJ1.vuJ1.1/ is hiding, we need to massage the result a little. 
For the magnetic moment, we only have to allow for the photon, which conesponds to 
an unconstrained external magnetic field, to be off-shell; the spinors can be on-shell, which 
helps simplify things. For example, we can use the Gordon identity, which you derived in 
Problem 11.4, and which holds for on-shell spinors: 
Therefore 
(17.7) 
The first term is an interaction just like the scalar QED interaction: the photon couples to 
the momentum of the field, as in the D~ term in the Klein-Gordon equation. The q~ and q~ 
in this first term are just the momentum factors that appear in the scalar QED Feynman rule. 
j The E . § term is not an electric dipole moment since it has an imaginary coefficient. Instead, it is the Lorentz-
invariant completion of the magnetic moment.

101he correction to the magnetic moment must come from graph invol ving tbe photon and 
the electron that contribute corrections to the process in Eq. (17.5). We can parametrize the 
J1lost general possible result, at any-loop order, as 
iM" ~ A 
~ u(q,) Un" + !,p", hot + j,qi!)u(q,). (17.8) 
'11 
q2 
Here we have included all Lorentz vectors that might possibly appear, with the fi their 
unknown Lorentz scalar coefficients. The fi can depend in general on contractions of 
momenta, such as p. q or p2, or on contractions with ,-matrices, such as p. (In more general 
theories, they could also depend on ,5, but QED is parity invariant so ,5 cannot appear.) 
For the magnetic moment application, we can assume the external spinors are on-shell, 
but the photon, representing an unconstrained external magnetic field, must still be off-
shell. (Or, if you prefer, imagine this diagram is embedded in a larger Coulomb-scattering 
diagram with an off-shell intermediate photon and on-shell external spinors.) 
The 1; are not all independent. Using momentum conservation, pI" = q~ - qi, we can 
set 12 = 0 and substitute away all the pI" dependence. Then, if there are factors of cfJ-
or ¢ in the k they can be removed by using the Dirac equation, cfJ-u(qd = mu(qd, 
and U(q2)¢ = mu(q2). So, we can safely assume the fi are real functions that can only 
depend on ql . q2 and m, or more conventionally on p2 = 2m2 - 2ql . q2 and m 2. Moreover, 
2 
we can fix the relative dependence by dimensional analysis so the fi are functions of ~. 
Next, the Ward identity (which we showed in Section 14.8 holds even if the photon is 
off-shell) implies 
o = pl"u(fnl" + hqi + f4q~)U 
= hUJDu + (p. qdhuu + (p. q2)f4UU 
= (p . qdhuu + (p . q2)f4UU. 
(17.9) 
We then use p . ql = q2 . ql - m 2 = -p. q2 to get h = f4. Thus, there are only two 
independent form factors. We can then use the Gordon identity, Eq. (17.6), to rewrite the 
qi and q~ dependence in terms of al"v , leading to 
(17.10) 
which is our final form. This parametrization holds to all orders in perturbation theory. The 
functions Fl and F2 are known as form factors. The leading graph, Eq. (17.5), gives 
(17.11) 
Loops will give contributions to Fl and F2 at order a and higher. 
Which of these two form factors could give an electron magnetic moment? Fl modifies 
the original eAl"ijj,l"1jJ coupling. This renormalizes the electric charge, as we saw from

the actual magnetic moment is measured at non-relativistic energies with IPl « m, the 
moment that can be compared to data is 
g = 2 + 2F2(0). 
(17.12) 
Thus, we have reduced the problem to calculating F2 (0) . 
17.2 Evaluating the graphs 
There are four possible I-loop graphs that could contribute to MI". Three of them, 
(17.13) 
can only give terms proportional to ,I". This is easy to see because these graphs just correct 
the propagators for the corresponding particles. Thus, these graphs can only contribute to 
F1 and have no effect on the magnetic moment. The fourth graph is 
p

with pI" = q~ - qi. This is the only graph we have to consider for g - 2. 
Employing the Feynman rules, this graph is 

17.2 Evaluating the graphs

The new denominator is the cube of

(17.16) 
(17.17) 
(17.18) 
(17.l9) 
(17.20) 
(17.21) 
Thus, we want to shift k'" ---7 k'" - yp'" + zqi to make the denominator (k2 _ ~) 3. 
The numerator in Eq. (17.15) is 
N'" = U(q2){V(P + ~ + m){'"(~ + m){vu(qt) 
= - 2U(q2)[h'"p + ~'Y'" ~ + m2, '" - 2m(2k'" + P'")] u(qI). 
(17.22) 
Shifting k'" ---7 k'" - yp'" + zqi then gives 
1 
- '2N'" = U(q2) [(~ - YP + zqlt),'"p + (~ - YP + zqlt) ,'" (~ - YP + zqi)] u(qt) 
(17.23) 
Using k'" kV = ~ g'"v k2, the Gordon identity, x + y + z = 1 and a fair amount of algebra, 
this simplifies to 
-~N'" = [_~k2 + (1 - x )(1 - y)p2 + (1- 4z + z2)m2] U(q2){'"U(Ql) 
+ imz(1- z)PvU(q2)CT,"vU(Ql ) 
+ m(z - 2)(x - y)p'"U(q2)U(Ql ). 
(17.24) 
We have found three independent terms instead of two since we have not used the Ward 
identity. Indeed, the Ward identity should fall out of the calculation automatically. To see 
that it does, note that the p'" term gives a contribution to M~ of the form 
iM~ = 4e311dx dy dz o(x+y+z-1)m(z-2)(x-y) J 
(~:~4 (k2 _ ~ + if:)3 U(Q2)U(ql)' 
(17.25) 
Next, note that both ~ in Eq. (17.21) and the integral measure are symmetric in x +---* y, 
but the integrand is antisymmetric. Thus this term is zero.

culation has been performed up to 4-100p level. One cannot compare theory to experiment 
directly, since the theory is expressed as a function of a, which cannot be measured more 
precisely any other way. Therefore 9 - 2 is now used to define the renormalized value of 
the fine-structure constant, which comes out to a- 1 = 137.035999070 ± (9.8 x 10-10). 
Problems 
17.1 In supersymmetry, each fermion has a scalar partner, and each gauge boson has a 
fermionic partner. For example, the partner of the electron is the selectron (e), the 
partner of the muon is the smuon (P,), and the partner of the photon is the photino 
(A). The Lagrangian gets additional terms:

In this chapter we will study the following I-loop Feynman diagram: 
... o 
... 
which is known as the electron self-energy graph. You may recall we encountered this 
diagram way back in Chapter 4 in the context of Oppenheimer's Lamb shift calculation 
using old-fashioned perturbation theory. Indeed, this graph is important for the Lamb Shift. 
However, rather than compute the Lamb shift (which is rather tedious and mostly of his-
torical interest for us), we will use this graph to segue to a more general understanding 
of renormalization. You may also recall Oppenheimer's frustrated comment, quoted at the 
end of Chapter 4, where he suggested that the resolution of these infinities would require an 
"adequate theory of the masses of the electron and proton." In this chapter, we will provide 
such an adequate theory. 
The electron self-energy graph corrects the electron propagator in the same way that the 
photon self-energy graph corrects the photon propagator. Recall from Chapter 16 that the 
photon self-energy graph could be interpreted as a vacuum polarization effect that gen-
erated a logarithmic weakening of the Coulomb potential at large distances. Thus, by 
measuring rl V(rd - r2 V(r2) with two different values of r one could measure vacuum 
polarization and compare it to the theoretical prediction. In particular, we were able to 
renormalize the divergent vacuum polarization graph by relating it to something (the poten-
tial) that can be directly connected to observables (e.g. the force between two currents or 
the energy levels of hydrogen). 
Proceeding in the same way, the electron self-energy graph would correct the effect 
generated by the exchange of an electron. However, since the electron is a fermion, and 
charged, this exchange cannot be interpreted as generating a potential in any useful way. 
Thus, it is not clear what exactly one would measure to test whatever result we find by 
evaluating the self-energy diagram. 
For the self-energy graph, and many other divergent graphs we will evaluate, it is helpful 
to navigate away from observables such as the Lamb shift or the Coulomb potential, which 
are particular to one type of con'ection, to thinking of general observables. Unfortunately, 
the question of what is observable and what is not is extremely subtle and has no precise 
definition in quantum field theory. For example, one might imagine that -matrix elemeni. 
are observable; in many cases they are aCllJally infinite due to fR divergence as we will 
see in Chapter 20. Luckily, one does not need a preci e deriniti n of an observable to 
understand renormalization, since even non-observable quantilie can be renormalized. We

One advantage f renormaJizing general Green' functi n ralher than

ments is that the Green's functions can appear as internal subgraphs in many different 
s-matrix calculations. In particular, we will find that in QED, while there are an infinite 
number of divergent graphs contributing to the S-matrix, the divergences can be efficiently 
categorized and renormalized through the one-particle irreducible subgraphs (defined as 
graph thaI cannOI b · cuI in two by cutting a ingle pI' pagat r). As we will see, these one-

rganizing the discu. ion in terms of Green's functions and one-
particle irreducible diagrams will vastly simplify the proof of renormalizability in QED (in 
Chapter 21) and is clitical to a general understanding of how renormalization works in 
various quantum field theories. 
In this chapter, we abbreviate (nIT{ · · · }In) with ( ... ) for simplicity. 
18.1 Vacuum expectation values 
We begin our consideration of the renormalization of general Green's functions by 
considering the simplest Green's functions, the I-point functions: 
(4)(X)), 
('If; (x)) , 
(AI"(x)) , 
(18.2) 
These give the expectation values of fields in the vacuum, also known as vacuum 
expectation values. 
At tree-level, the vacuum expectation value of a field is the lowest energy configuration 
that satisfies the classical equations of motion. All Lagrangians we have considered so 
far begin at quadratic order in the fields, so that '1/) = A = 4> = 0 are solutions to the 
equations of motion. Other solutions, such as plane waves in the free theory, contribute 
to the gradient terms in the energy density and thus have higher energy than the constant 
solution. Thus, 'If; = A = 4> = 0 is the minimum energy solution and all the expectation 
values in Eq. (18.2) vanish at tree-level. More directly, we can see that (4)) = ('If;) = 
(Ai') = 0 at tree-level in the canonically quantized theory, since each quantum field has 
creation and annihilation operators that vanish in the vacuum. 
323 

324 
Mass renormalization 
At I-loop, vacuum expectation values, for example for (A",), could come from diagraltts 
such as 
This is called a tadpole diagram. It and all higher-loop contributions to (A",) vanish iden, 
tically in QED. This is easy to see in perturbation theory, . ince all fermion loops with an 
odd number of photons attached involve a trace over an odd number of ,),-matrices, which 
vanishes. It is also true that ('ljJ) = 0 to all orders in Q 0 
imply becau e one cannot draIN 
any diagrams. 
A somewhat simpler proof that (A",) or ('ljJ) must vanish is that non-zero values would 
violate Lorentz invariance, and Lorentz invariance is a symmetry of the QED Lagrangian. 
However, it may sometimes happen that the vacuum does not in fact satisfy every symmetry 
of the Lagrangian, in which case we say spontaneous symmetry breaking has Occurred. 
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is covered in depth in Chapter 28. A familiar example is 
the spontaneous breaking of rotational invariance by a ferromagnet when cooled below its 
Curie temperature. At low temperature, the magnet has a preferred spin direction, which 
could equally well have pointed anywhere, but must point somewhere. Another example 
is the ground state of our universe, which has a preferred frame, the rest frame of the 
cosmic microwave background. In both cases space-time symmetries are symmetries of 
the Lagrangian but not of the ground state. 
Spontaneous symmetry breaking can also apply to internal symmebies, such as global 
or gauge symmetries of a theory. For example, in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) 
theory of superconductivity, the U(l) symmetry of QED is spontaneously broken in 
type-II superconductors as they are cooled below their critical temperature. The attrac-
tive force between electrons due to phonon exchange becomes stronger than the repulsive 
Coulomb force and the vacuum becomes charged. Another important example is the 
Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of weak interactions (Chapter 29). This theory embeds 
the low-energy theory of weak interactions into a larger theory which has an exact SU(2) 
symmetry that acts on the left-handed quarks and leptons. 
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is an immensely important topic in quantum field the-
ory, which we will systematically discuss beginning in Chapter 28, including more details 
of the above examples. Now, it is merely a distraction from our current task of understand-
ing renormalization. Since (A",) = ('ljJ) = 0 in QED to all orders in perturbation theory, 
there is nothing to renormalize and we can move on to 2-point functions. 
18.2 Electron self-energy 
There are a number of 2-point functions in QED. In Chapter 9, we discussed the renormal-
ization of the photon propagator that corresponds to (A",Av). Two-point functions such as 
('ljJA",) vanish identically in QED since there are simply no diagrams that could contribute 
to them. That leaves the fermion 2-point function ('ljJ-$). 

18.2 Electron self-energy 
~---------------------------------------
AS with the photon, it is helpful to study (1jJ7(;) in momentum space. We define the 
mentum space Green's function by 
(liD 
(1jJ(x)7(;(y)) = J 
(~~4e-iP(X-Y)iG(P)' 
(1S.3) 
This is possible since the left-hand side can only depend on x - y by translation invariance. 
At tree-level, G(p) is just the momentum space fermion propagator: 
iGo(p) == _i_. 
p-m 
At HooP it gets a correction due to the self-energy graph: 
p - k o

(1S.4) 
(IS.5) 
(1S.6) 
If this graph were contributing to an S -matrix element, rather than just a Green's function, 
we would remove the propagators from the external lines (the Go factors in Eq. (1S.5)) and 
contract with external on-shell spinors. This i~2 (p) is what we would get from the normal 
Feynman rules without the external spinors. 
Before evaluating this graph, we can observe an interesting feature that was not present 
in the photon case (the vacuum polarization graph). Including the self-energy graph, the 
effective electron propagator to I-loop is

(1S.7) 
In an S-matrix element, this correction might appear on an external leg, such as 
-0-< . 
In that case G(p) is contracted with an on-shell external spinoI' and the result 
multiplied by a factor of p - m from the LSZ reduction formula. Now, there is no reason 
to expect that ~2(m) = 0 (and in fact it is not), so even after removing a single pole with 
P - m we see from Eq. (18.7) that there will still be a pole left over. That is, the S-matrix 
will be singular. This problem did not come up for the photon propagator and vacuum 
polarization, where the corrected photon propagator had only a single pole to all orders in 
perturbation theory. The resolution of this apparently singular S-matrix for electron scat-
tering is that the electron mass appearing in the LSZ formula does not necessarily have to

match the electron mass appearing in the Lagrangian. In the photon case, they were eqUal 
since both were zero. Once we evaluate the self-energy graph, we will then discuss ho ' 
the electron mass is renormalized and why the S-matrix remains finite.

18.2.1 Self-energy loop graph 
--
Evaluating the self-energy graph with Feynman parameters (see Appendix B) gives 
(18.8) 
Now we complete the square in the denominator and shift k ---+ k + px to give 
(18.9) 
where ~ = (1 - x)(m2 - p2x) and we have dropped the term linear in k in the numerator 
since it is odd under k ---+ -k and its integral therefore vanishes. This integrand scales as 
t4k and is therefore logarithmically divergent in the Uv. 
To regulate the UV divergence, we have to choose a regularization scheme. For peda-
gogical purposes we will evaluate this loop with both Pauli-Villars (PV) and dimensional 
regularization (DR). Recall (from Appendix B) that Pauli-Villars introduces heavy parti-
cles, of mass A with negative energy, for each physical particle in. the theory. Pauli-Villars 
is nice because the scale A is clearly a UV deformation, with the Pauli-Villars ghosts hav-
ing no effect on the low-energy theory as A ---+ 00. In dimensional regularization, which 
analytically continues to 4 - c dimensions, it is not clear that c is a UV deformation in any 
sense. Dimensional regularization is much easier to use for more complicated theories than 
QED, so eventually we will use it exclusively. For now, it is helpful to use two regulators 
to see that results are regulator independent. 
With a Pauli-Villars photon, the self-energy graph becomes 
(18.l0) 
with ~' = (1 - x) (m 2 - p2x) + xA 2 . Since we take A ---+ 00, we can more simply take 
~' = xA 2 . The regulated integral is now convergent and can be evaluated using formulas 
from Appendix B. The result is

Note that in both cases ~2 (m) f= 0, so there will be a double-pole in the 2-point function 
at Hoop with the possibly dangerous consequences discussed below Eq. (1S.7). Also note 
that both results have divergences proportional to both m and 1- This implies that we need 
tWO quantities to renormalize, to remove both divergences. 
18.2.2 Renormalization 
As discussed in the introduction, we want the Green's function G(p) defined in Eq. (1S.3) 
to be finite. Thus, the infinities from the O(e2) contribution to this Green's function must 
be removed through renormalization. 
As with the vacuum polarization, we need to figure out what parameters in the theory 
can be renormalized to cancel the infinities in the self-energy graph. To begin, let us write 
the Lagrangian as 
(1S.14) 
In the study of vacuum polarization in Chapter 9, we concluded that the charge in the 
Lagrangian, now written as eo, called the bare charge, could be used to absorb an infinity. 
Recall that we defined a renormalized electric charge via 
2

eo = eR + eR1Iz(p ) + ... = eR 1 - -

o 
127r2 
_p~ 
, 
(1S.15) 
where II2 (P6) is formally infinite. Since eo has already been renormalized by vacuum 
polarization, we cannot renormalize it in a different way for the self-energy graph. 
To make G(p) finite the obvious Lagrangian parameter that might absorb the infinity is 
the bare electron mass, mo. Indeed, from Eq. (1S.7), 
. 
i 
i. 
i 
~G2(P) = -- + --[z~2(p)1--, 
p - mo

(1S.16) 
We can see that an (infinite) redefinition of ma = m + ~m with ~m of order e2 could 
compensate for an infinity at order e2 in L:2(p). Unfortunately, we saw in Eqs. (1S.11) 
and (1S.13) that ~2(P) has two types of infinities, one independent of p and the other 
proportional to 1- The mass renormalization can only remove one of these infinities. Thus, 
to progress further we need something else to renormalize. But what could it be? Our 
327 

328 
Mass renormalization 
---------------------------------------------------~ 
Lagrangian only had two parameters, m and e, and we have already defined how e is 
renormalized. 
In fact, there is another parameter: the normalization of the fermion wavefunction. let 
us write the fermion field in terms of creation and annihilation operators that we have been 
using all along as the bare free field: 
'ljJ°(x) = ~J d
3
p _ 1_
(asuse-iPx +bstvseiPX). 
L: 
(27T)3 y'2W;, 
P P 
P P 
(18.17) 
The bare free field is canonically normalized to give all the tree-level scattering results We 
have already calculated. We then define the renormalized field as 
'ljJR(x) = _1_ ~ J d3
p _1_ (aSuSe-iPX + bstvseiPX) == _1_'ljJo 
~ 
L: 
(27T)3 J2wp 
P 
P 
P 
P 
~ 
(18.18) 
for some (formally infinite) number Z2. This is the origin of the term renormalization. We 
index bare (infinite) fields and parameters with a 0 and physical finite renormalized fields 
and parameters with an R. 
For the tree-level theory, Z2 = 1 is required to be consistent with the normalization Used 
in all our scattering formulas. So it is natural to account for radiative corrections by writing 
(18.19) 
where 62 is the counterterm, which has a formal Taylor series expansion in e starting at 
order e2 . We also write 
rno = ZmmR 
and expand Zm = 1 + 6m, with 6m the mass counterterm. 1 Then 
mo = mR + mR6m . 
(18.20) 
(18.21) 
As we will see, particularly when we cover renormalized perturbation theory in Chapter 19, 
using counterterms rather than bare and renormalized quantities directly will be extremely 
efficient. 
All the calculations we have done so far have been with fields with the conventional 
(bare) normalization. However, it is the Green's function of renormalized fields that should 
have finite physical values. So we define 
('ljJ°(x)1jJO(y)) = i J 
(~~4e-iP(X-Y)Gbare(p) 
and 
(1jJR(X)ijJR(y)) = i J 
(~:~4e-iP(X-Y) GR(p) 
and expect GR(p) to be finite. By definition, 
GR(p) = ;2 cbare(p). 
(18.22) 
(18.23) 
(18.24) 
I Another common convention is Z2mo == mR + 8m.. Our convention is more commonly used in modern field 
theory calculations.

So noW we can choose 02 and om to remove all the infinities in the electron self-energy.

for dimensional regularization will remove the infinities. With these choices, we will get 
finite answers for the 2-point function CR(p) at any scale p. 
We can choose different values for the counterterms which differ from these by finite 
numbers and CR (1) will still be finite. Any prescription for choosing the finite parts of the 
counterterms is known as a subtraction scheme. Not only must observables in a renor-
malized theory be finite, but they also must be independent of the subtraction scheme, as 
we will see. Nevertheless, there are some smart choices for subtraction schemes and some 
not-so-smart choices. 
The two subtraction schemes most often used in quantum field theory are the on-shell 
subtraction scheme and the minimal subtraction eMS) scheme. Minimal subtraction is by 
far the simplest scheme and the one used in almost all modem quantum field theory calcu-
lations. In minimal subtraction the counterterms are defined to have no finite parts at all, so 
that 02 and Om are given by Eqs. (18.27) and (18.28). More commonly, a slightly modified 
version of this prescription known as modified minimal subtraction NIS is used, in which 
In( 47r) and "(E finite parts in dimensionally regulated results are also subtracted off. MS 
just turns il back into f.L in dimensionally regularized amplitudes, 
In on-shell subtraction, the renormalized mass mR appearing in Green's functions is 
identified with the observed electron mass mp which can be defined to all orders as the 
position of the pole in the S-matrix.2 To see how this identification works in practice, it is 
helpful to look at the possible form of the higher-order corrections. 
2 Actually, there is no isolated pole in the S-matrix associated with the electron. Rather, the electron mass is the 
beginning of a cut in the complex plane. This will be discussed more in Chapter 24.

which is easy to sum. More generally, any possible graph contributing to this Green's 
function is part of some geometric series. Conversely, the entire Green's function can be 
written as the sum of a single geometric series constructed by sewing together graphs that 
cannot be cut in two by slicing a single propagator. We call such graphs one-particle 
irreducible (lPI). For example,

1- ma + 621- ma62 + ~2 (1) + ... 
(18.35) 
where the··· are formally O(e4 ) or higher. Then, usingEq. (18.21), ma = mR +mR6m, 
this becomes 
(18.36) 
We will write this more conveniently as 
'GR ( ) 
i 
z 
1 = ,- mR + ~R(1)' 
(18.37) 
with ~R(1) = ~2(1) + 621- (6m + (2)mR + O(e4 ). 
You may have noted that this result would follow easily from Eq. (18.26) if we could 
treat the counterterms as contributions to IPI graphs. To justify such treatment, all we have 
to do is rewrite the bare free Lagrangian in terms of renormalized fields: 
£ = ii/}fj'ljJa - maifa'ljJa = iZ2ifRfj'ljJR - Z2ZmmRifR'ljJR. 
(18.38) 
Using Eqs. (18.19) and (18.20) this becomes 
£ = iifRfj'ljJR - mRifR'ljJR + i62ifRfj'ljJR - mR(62 + 6m)ifR'ljJR. 
(18.39) 
Thus, we can treat the counterterms, which start at order e2 , as interactions whose Feyn-
man rules give contributions 621 and -(62 + 6m )mR to the IPI graphs. Then Eq. (18.37) 
follows from the general form Eq. (18.33) with m = mR and ~ = 
~R. Expanding 
the Lagrangian in terms of renormalized quantities leads to so-called renormalized per-
turbation theory. Renormalized perturbation theory will be discussed more completely, 
including interactions and the photon field, in the next chapter. 
18.3.1 On-shell subtraction 
Baving summed all of the IPI diagrams into the renormalized propagator, we can now 
identify the physical electron mass mp as the location of its pole. More precisely, the 
331 

332 
Mass renormalization 
~------
------------------------------------------------------~ 
renormalized propagator should have a single pole at p = mp with residue i. The location 
of the pole is a definition of mass, known as the pole mass. It is important to keep in mind 
that the pole mass is physical and independent of any subtraction scheme used to Set the 
finite parts of the counterterms. In the on-shell subtraction scheme, the finite parts of the 
counterterms are chosen so that mR = mp. In minimal subtraction, mR i= mp. In either 
case the 2-point Green's function still has a pole at mp. 
From Eq. (18.37), for GR(p) to have a pole at p = mp the IPI graphs must satisfy 
(18.40) 
Having residue i implies

where we have used L'Hopital's rule. This implies 
(18.42) 
These conditions define the pole mass, independent of the subtraction scheme. 
In the on-shell subtraction scheme, the renormalized mass mR is set equal to the pole 
mass mp. Then, recalling L:R(p) = L:2(p) + 62P - (6m + 62) mR +. ", these conditions 
imply to order e2

Recall that the LSZ theorem converts Green's functions to S-matrix elements by adding 
external polarizations and factors of p - ma to project onto physical one-particle states. 
However, we have now seen that the location of the pole in the electron propagator is 
not the value of the mass ma appearing in the Lagrangian, but rather at some other loca-
tion ffip. Moreover, we have found that only Green's functions of renorrnalized fields, 
333 

334 
Mass renormalization 
--------------------------------------------------
such as C R 
theorem to 
(;j;R'lj;R), should be finite. Thus, it would be natural to modify the LSZ 
(18.53) 
This is almost correct. 
The subtlety is that in the derivation of LSZ we had to assume that all the interactions 
happened during some finite time interval, and that as t ---+ ±oo we could treat the theory 
as free. In the free theory, the pole would be at m o. Thus, we really want the theory nOt 
to be entirely free at asymptotic times, but to include all of the corrections that mOVe the 
pole from mo to mp. Those corrections are precisely the series of IPI insertions onto the 
electron propagator. Thus, in projecting onto the pole mass, with the (p - mp) factors 
we must assume that all of the corrections to the on-shell external electron propagato; 
have been included. For example, diagrams such as ~ 
would only contribute to 
correcting the external electron propagator, which would then be removed by LSZ. 
Thus, the LSZ theorem in a renormalized theory is 
(f!S!i) = (Plf - mp) ... (T(i - mp) ('lj;R ... 'lj;R) amputated' 
(18.54) 
where amputated means the external lines are chopped off until they begin interacting 
with the other fields. Only amputated diagrams contribute to S-matrix elements. 
Note that amputating diagrams does not mean that self-energy graphs are never impor-
tant. When a self-energy bubble occurs on an internal line, as in H, 
which 
provides a radiative correction to Compton scattering, it will have an important physi-
cal effect. All the renormalized LSZ theorem says is that you should not correct external 
lines for S-matrix elements since those corrections are already accounted for in the updated 
definition of asymptotic states. 
18.4 Minimal subtraction 
In minimal subtraction, the counterterms are fixed with no reference to the pole mass. 
The prescription is simply that the counterterms should have no finite parts. Thus, with 
Pauli-Villars, we get Eq. (18.27): 
0:

02 = - -InA

subtraction for use with Pauli-Villars so that

C The subtracti n p(')int already appeared in 
hapter 16 on vacuum polarization where it 
was set equal to the long-distance scale where the renormalized electric charge, eR, was 
defined. As in that case, when one compares observables, such as combinations of the 
Coulomb potential T1 V(Td - T2 V(T2) measured at different scales, the subtraction point 
wiII drop out. 
The subtraction point also appears as the parameter p, in dimensional regularization. 
Recall that in dimensional regularization p, is introduced by the rescaling e2 ---+ p,4-de2, 
wbich lets the electric charge remain dimensionless in d dimensions. In dimensional 
regularization, minimal subtraction gives Eq. (18.28):

which is UV finite and has p, in it, not {t. As with Pauli-Villars, there is a one-parameter 
family of renormalized IPI corrections. In both cases, the subtraction point p, is an arbi-
trary scale which is not taken to infinity but will drop out of physical calculations. The 
In(47rC'E) terms in the counterterms are almost always left implicit in MS, and p, and {t 
Used interchangeably. 
The value of mR is finite in MS and known as the MS mass. The renormalized electron 
propagator will in general not have a pole at p = mR· There is still a pole at p = mp

In particular, the M8 mass depends on the arbitrary scale J-l. 
While your first instinct might be that this extra parameter J-l in minimal subtraction adds 
an unnecessary complication, it is actually extremely useful. The fact that physical observ_ 
abIes are independent of J-l gives a powerful constraint. Indeed, demanding dd 0 ===: 0

18.5 Summary and discussion 
In this chapter we saw that the electron self-energy graph contributes loop corrections to 
the electron propagator. This loop was divergent, but the divergence could be removed 
by renormalizing the electron's quantum field, 'lj;0 = vz;,'Ij;R, and redefining the elec-
tron mass, mo = ZmmR. In these equations, 'lj;0 and mO refer to bare quantities that are 
formally infinite, while 'lj;R and mR are finite renormalized quantities. The quantities Om 
and 02 defined by expanding the renormalization factors around the classical values, e.g. 
Z2 = 1 + 02, are known as counterterms. These counterterms can be chosen to cancel the 
infinite contribution of the electron self-energy graph to the renormalized electron propa-
gator. While the cancellation fixes the infinite parts of the counterterms, the finite parts are 
arbitrary. Conventions for fixing the finite parts are known as subtraction schemes. 
We saw that the general geometric series of loops correcting the propagator can be 
summed to all orders in 0:, leading to a renormalized propagator of the form 
'GR ( ) 
i 
~ 
P = P - mR + L:R(p) 
(18.66) 
Here, L:R(p) represents one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams plus counterterm con-
tributions. Up to order e2, we found L:R(p) = 
L:2(p) + 02P -
(om + (h)mR' This 
renormalized propagator should have a pole at the physical electron mass, the pole mass, 
with residue i: 
iGR(p) = 
i 
+ terms regular at p = mp.

(18.68) 
SoUletimes this is used to interpret Z2 as the residue of the pole. However, since both Z2 
ad the bare propagator are formally infinite, this interpretation must be made with care. 
a Two subtraction schemes were discussed. The first, the on-shell scheme, was defined by 
equating the locati~n of the pol~ of the propa~ator, m p, with the renormalized mas.s, m R == 
This, along wIth a constramt on the residue of the pole, generated two equatIons: 
'({W· 
dd ~R(r) 1 
= o. 
P 
p=mp 
(18.69) 
These equations, which apply to all orders in perturbation theory, fix the counterterms 62 
and 6m · They are known as the on-shell renormalization conditions. 
The second scheme, known as minimal subtraction, simply sets the finite parts of 62 and 
Om to zero. Modified minimal subtraction also subtracts off In( 471') and 'YE factors, which 
effectively replaces p, by JL in dimensionally regulated amplitudes. In minimal subtraction, 
the renormalized mass (written as mR or often just m) is known as the MS mass. It is in 
general different from the pole mass. At I-loop, we found 
mR=mp+~R(mp)=mp[l - 4:(5+3In~~)]
. 
(18.70) 
This expression depends on an arbitrary scale JL known as the subtraction point, which is 
not taken to 00. While the extra parameter JL may seem superfluous, we will see in Chap-
ter 23 that physical observables being independent of JL leads to an important constraint, the 
renormalization group equations. Even without using the renormalization group, JL inde-
pendence order-by-order in perturbation theory gives an important check that an observable 
has been calculated correctly. We will provide a number of examples in the next two 
chapters. 
You might wonder why on earth anyone would use an unphysical and arbitrary MS 
mass rather than the physical pole mass. The basic answer is that MS is a much simpler 
subtraction scheme than the on-shell scheme. It is often easier to compute loops in MS and 
then convert the masses back to the pole mass at the end rather than to do the computations 
in terms of the pole mass from the beginning. Numerically, the differences between pole 
masses and MS are often quite small for JL chosen of order mp. One important exception 
is the top-quark mass, where mp rv 175 GeV but mR rv 163 Gev. This 5% difference 
is important for precision physics, to be discussed in Chapter 31. A more sophisticated 
answer is that the MS mass has an appealing property that it is free of ambiguities related to 
non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics (so-called renormalon ambiguities). 
Indeed, for particles such as quarks, which can never be seen as asymptotic states, there is 
not actually a pole in the S-matrix, so the pole mass is not always a useful mass definition. 
It is important to keep in mind that the physical electron mass, mp, is the location of 
the pole in the electron propagator whether or not we identified this mass with mR. In 
the on-shell scheme, we cannot ask about radiative corrections to the electron mass mp

It is not always easy to determine which scheme experimental mass measurements COr, 
respond to. For example, the top mass has been measured at the Tevatron and the Large 
Hadron CollideI' by fitting a line shape to the output of a particular Monte-Carlo event gen_ 
erator called Pythia. Thus, one can say the top mass is measured in the Pythia sChellle 
Although the Pythia scheme is close to the on-shell scheme, for a precision top mass mea~ 
surement it is necessary to have a systematic way to convert between the two. A better Way 
to measure the top mass would be by directly examining the cross section for e+ e- -f tf 
for ECM rv 2mt rv 350 GeV. This would let us fit the IS mass, which is yet another mass 
scheme (and renormalon free, like the MS mass). 
Finally, we discussed that for S-maflix elements the LSZ reduction theorem should be 
modified to 
UISli) = (pit - mp) ... (T/i - mp) ('ljJR ... 'ljJR) amputated, 
(18.71) 
where amputated refers to not including diagrams with 1 PI corrections to external legs. 
This was necessary because those corrections are already included in what we call external 
states, with poles at mp. 
Despite the amputation of corrections to external legs, there are physical implications 
of the electron self-energy when the graph corrects internal lines. Historically, the most 
important such correction was the Lamb shift (the splitting between the 2S1/ 2 and 2P1/ 2 
levels of the hydrogen atom). Radiative corrections to the electron propagator were what 
Oppenheimer was missing when he calculated this shift in old-fashioned perturbation 
theory in 1932. Hans Bethe's famous estimate,

for the Lamb shift from 1947 came from cutting off the IR divergence in the self-energy

in QED.

normalized perturbation theory 
• 
The idea behind renormalization is that for every infinity there should be a free parameter 
to absorb it. In the previous chapter we made this goal more precise by promising that 
an UV divergences in all time-ordered correlation functions could be removed through 
renormalization. This is a sufficient condition for all S-matrix elements to be UV finite. So 
far we have renormalized the vacuum energy density (for the Casimir force), the electric 
charge (for the Coulomb potential), the electron mass and the electron field (to keep the 
pole in the electron propagator at the electron mass with residue i). Are we always going 
to need a new renormalization condition for every calculation?

written in terms of bare (unrenormalized) fields and couplings (as indicated by the 0 super-
scripts), it seems there are only five things we could possibly renormalize: the electron 
mass m, the electric charge e, the vacuum energy density p, and the normalization of the 
fields for the electron and the photon. An important point is that all we have are these five 
parameters, and they must be sufficient to absorb every infinity. There are many more than 
five correlation functions we can compute. So will QED be finite? 
At the risk of spoiling your suspense, the answer is yes. We will prove it in Chapter 21. In 
the current chapter, we introduce an efficient organizational framework for keeping track of 
the various infinities called renormalized perturbation theory. Renormalized perturbation 
theory will be used throughout the remainder of this book. After introducing the frame-
work, we discuss the remaining renormalization conditions that fix the photon field strength 
renormalization and the electric charge renormalization. Although we already renormal-
ized the electric charge, when we studied vacuum polarization in Chapter 15, we will 
renormalize it in a slightly different way here. Our new way will let us understand why 
it is not unnatural for the proton and electron to have exactly opposite charges. 
In this chapter, we use the abbreviation ( ... ) = (D IT {- .. }I D). 
19.1 Counterterms 
As We saw in the previous chapter, the Green's functions we expect to be finite are those 
of renormalized fields, G = 
('Ij;Rif;R A R ... ). For example, the renormalized fermion 
propagator was

Renormalized perturbation theory 
---------------------------------------------~ 
where the "regular" part is non-singular as p ----+ mp. Here mp is the pole mass, a finite 
non-perturbative definition of the electron mass. 
' 
The renormalized fields are conventionally related to the bare fields appearing in the 
QED Lagrangian in Eq. (19.1) by field strength renormalizations Z2 and Z3 as 
'ljJ0 = y!z;'ljJR, 
A~ =VZ;A~. 
(19.3) 
The (infinite) bare mass mo is related to a (finite) renormalized mass mR by a mass 
renormalization Zm: 
(19.4) 
The (infinite) bare electric charge eo is related to a (finite) renormalized electric charge elt 
by a charge renormalization Ze: 
(19.5) 
In Chapter 16, the renormalized electric charge was defined so that the Coulomb potential 
2 
was V(1") = ::r at very large 1"; in Chapter 18 the renormalized electron mass was defined 
as the location of the pole in the exact electron 2-point function. For now, we do not need 
to know how eR and mR are defined, just that they can be taken finite. 
After rescaling the fields in this, the QED Lagrangian becomes 
1 (R

£ = -4Z3 alLAv - avAIL 
+ iZ2i!;R f/J'ljJR - Z2 Zmm R7JJ R'ljJR - eRZeZ2y'Z;,1/JRJR'ljJR + PO· 
(19.6) 
We will from now on drop the subscript R on renormalized fields. Since we use 'ljJ0 and 
A~ for bare fields, this introduces no ambiguity. It is conventional also to define 
(19.7) 
Then, 
(19.8) 
We will ignore Po unless otherwise stated from now on, as the vacuum energy density plays 
merely a spectator role in the renormalization of QED. 
Next we want to expand around some classical tree-level values for these parameters. 
The field strengths are naturally expanded around Z2 = Z3 = 1; Zl should also be 
expanded around 1 so that eR represents the classical electric charge. Finally, we expand 
mo around some renormalized mass mR, which can be taken to be the pole mass or MS 
mass or any other convenient choice. It is not necessary to specify exactly how eR and mR 
are defined at this point. The expansions are conventionally written as 
Zl=1+o1 , 
Z2=1+02, 
z3=1+o3, 
Zm=1+om, 
with all the counterterms Oi starting at order e~. Sometimes we will also write

In renormalized perturbation theory, the counterterms appear as interactions in the 
Lagrangian and can be used in Feynman diagrams, just like any other interactions. The 
feynman rules are as follows: 
. * . 
(19.13) 
'[he * indicates a counterterm insertion as an interaction on an electron line. A counter-
term on a photon line gives the vertex 
(19.14) 
In a gauge-fixed Lagrangian, there is another term, like 21~ (iJI"A'll, which gives a new 
counterterm to renormalize ~ and modifies the pl"pV term in Eq. (19.14). In Feynman gauge, 
the Feynman rule for the photon line counterterm simplifies to 
(Feynman gauge). 
(19.15) 
Finally, there is the vertex counterterm: 
(19.16) 
A virtue of renormalized perturbation theory is that even though the counterterms are all 
large numbers, proportional to some regulator cutoff such as ~, they are defined through 
their Taylor expansions in powers of e R (starting at order e~). In particular, the perturbation 
expansion can be justified since eR is small, even if c « 1 (that is, e~ < eR). In contrast, 
the way we had renormalized in previous chapters was through an expansion in the bare 
COupling, eo rv ~, which is not small for c « 1 (that is e6 > eo). Thus, in renormalized 
perturbation theory one has a more legitimate perturbation expansion. 
It is important to keep in mind that the counterterms must be numbers (or functions of 
eR and mR) - they cannot depend on derivatives or momenta. For example, what would it 
mean if a field strength renormalization were 02 = D? Then our quantum field would be 
1/JR = VI + D'l/Jo, which would have completely different Feynman rules and interactions. 
As long as the counterterms are numbers, and finite numbers once the theory is regulated, 
the rules we have developed for quantum field theory are unchanged. Now it may happen

19.2 Two-point functions 
As a warm-up, let us redo the electron self-energy calculation using renormalized 
perturbation theory. Recall our notation for the 2-point Green's function: 
(19.17) 
In renormalized perturbation theory, the tree-level Feynman diagram for the 2-point 
Green's function is 
.. 
= ---
(19.18) 
This is just the renormalized electron propagator. Note that we are calculating Green's 
functions in this chapter, not S-matrix elements, so the external lines are not truncated and 
external polarizations/spinors are not added. 
At order e'h there is the loop graph, involving the ordinary vertices, from Eq. (19.12), 
.. o 
.. 
(19.19) 
where ~2(p) was computed in Section 18.2; and there is also the counterterm graph, 
i 
--i(p02 - (Om + 02)mR) 
z 
p-mR 
p-mR 
... * .. 
(19.20) 
Here, the counterterm is acting like a vertex, and since we are computing Green's functions 
not S-matrix elements, we do not amputate the externallines. So, 
. i i i  
zG(p) = 
+ 
i(~2(p)+p02-(Om+02)mR) 
+O(e~), (19.21) 
p-mR p-mR 
p-mR 
which agrees with Eq. (18.26). 
Now we see that the one-particle irreducible graphs (including counterterms) are ~(p) == 
~2(p) + p02 - (om + 02)mR + O(e~). Summing them results in 
(19.22) 

19.2 Two-point functions 
we can use the on-shell renormalization conditions

a Of particular interest to us in this chapter will be the value of the 62 counterterm in the 
on-shell scheme, which was calculated in Chapter 18 both in dimensional regularization,

(19.26) 
Next we will use a similar analysis for the photon self-energy to fix 63. 
19.2.1 Photon self-energy 
Proceeding as with the electron self-energy, we define the Fourier-transformed Green's 
function G'"v (p) in terms of the exact 2-point function in the full interacting theory as

(19.27) 
At order eJt there is a contribution to G'"v from the I-loop graph using the ordinary Feyn-
man rules in Eq. (19.12). The result was calculated in Section 16.2 and found to have the

The loop and the counterterm graph are the only one-particle irreducible contributions

II(p2) is the equivalent for the photon of I: (1) for the electron. 
Note that the dressed photon propagator GI"V(p) automatically has a pole at p2 = O. 
In the electron case, we had two on-shell renormalization conditions: one put the mass at 
the location of the pole, the other set the residue equal to i. In the photon case, only one 
condition is needed, to set the residue: 
II(O) = O.

This is fortuitous, as we only have one counterterm, (h. At order eA, this condition

~:ati on . This i allowed because phy ical results do not care how the infinities are removed. 
In thi case, the connection between 63 and the charge renormalization counterterm 5e is 
niveJl by Eq. (L9.1 1): Oc = o~ - 62 - 40:i. We will shortly find that 51 = 52 and therefore 
~le field trength and charge renonnalizations are actually proportional, 5e = -
~ 53. But 
first we have to define an on-shell renormalization condition for 53, which we do through 
[be 3-point Green's function in Section 19.3. 
BoW do we know that to all orders only one counterterm will be needed for on-shell 
renormalization of the photon propagator and not two, as for the electron? To answer this 
question, note that it might have been possible, a priori, for the loop to give 
____ ~

= _i(p2g"'v - p"'pV)ehII2(p2) - iM2g",vehIIM(p2) , (19.39)

with the additional term proportional to some dimensionful quantity M (presumably 
related to the electron mass). This would have led to 
. ",v. 
g"'v 
~G (p) = -~ p2(1 + ehII2(p2)) + M2IIM(p2) + p"'pv terms. 
(19.40) 
Then we would have needed a counterterm so that we could renormalize the photon mass 
back to its physical location. However, there is no such counterterm available in the QED 
Lagrangian. Would this imply that QED cannot be renormalized? No! 
To get an appropriate counterterm we would just have to modify the Lagrangian by 
adding a photon mass term: 
( 
0)2 
2 
L = LQED + m, A"" 
(19.41) 
which allows for the counterterm to appear in the redefinition of the bare photon mass m~. 
In QED, no M2 term appears at any order. Since the M2 term corresponds to a photon 
mass in the Lagrangian, it cannot appear by gauge invariance. Indeed, it is easy to see that a 
loop of the form ofEq. (19.39) violates the Ward identity, which we proved in Section 14.8 
holds to all orders in perturbation theory in QED even for off-shell photons. 
19.3 Three-point functions 
At this point we have shown that all infinities in all 1- and 2-point functions in QED can 
be canceled with three counterterms, 52, 5m and 53. Next, we look at 3-point functions. 
The first (and only non-trivial) 3-point function in QED is (1,b(xl)A"'(x)~(X2)). The 
one-particle irreducible contributions to this 3-point function should not include external

leg corrections, which we have already calculated and rendered finite by the counterter 
02, Om and 03 in the renormalization of the 2-point functions. As before, we write 
Ills 
--i'Rr"~ ~. 
This is normalized so that at leading order rl' = "lL. More generally, we showed in Chap_ 
ter 17 that, by Lorentz invariance and the Ward identity (which holds for off-shell photons) 
arbitrary contributions lO r / l can be wrill'en in terms oftwo Lorentz-scalar form factors p' 
, 
1 
and F 2 : 
(19.43) 
At leading order: 
(19.44) 
At next-to-1eading order (order e~), the form factors get contributions from a loop graph 
and from counterterms: 
+ ... . 
(19.45) 
From Eq. (19.16) we see that the counterterm gives rt" = 01/1", which contributes only to 
F1 (p2). 
We calculated F2 (p2) at I-loop when we considered corrections to the magnetic moment 
of the electron in Chapter 17. There we found a finite answer:

In particular, F2 (0) = 2~' which led to a prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment 
of the electron: g - 2 = 2F2 (0) = ~. Since this correction was finite, no counterterm was 
needed. 
We also began the calculation of F1 (p2) at I-loop. Appending the counterterm diagram 
to the expression for F1 (p2) in Chapter 17, we find

Now let us evaluate f(p2). The integral is both UV and IR divergent. We will regulate 
tbe UV divergence with dimensional regularization and the IR divergence with a photon 
mass, as we did the electron self-energy graph calculation in Section 18.2. In d dimensions

Given that 01 and 02 came from entirely different loop calculations (the vertex correc-
tion and the electron self-energy graph), it appears almost magical thqt 01 = 02. So their 
equality, if not just a coincidence, would imply something highly non-trivial about QED. 
In fact, 01 = 02 exactly, as we will prove in Section 19.5. This result is equivalent to the 
QED charge current, Jit = ijrylt'ljJ, not getting renormalized. 

19.4 Renormalization conditions in QED

19.4 Renormalization conditions in QED 
We have found it et of four renormalization conditions that fix the four counterterms (h, 62, 
63 and Dill in QED. ]n the 0 11- hell scheme, th~ ~enormalized electron mass mR is identified 
with ell pole rna . , mR = mp, and the condItions are 
~(mp) = 0, 
(19.60) 
~/(mp) = 0, 
(19.61) 
fI"(O) = ,IL, 
(19.62) 
II(O) = O. 
(19.63) 
In these equations, i~(p) is the coefficient of P-~R in the sum of IPI contributions to 
the electron 2-point function; II (p2) is the coefficient of pi2 (_getV + p;f) in the sum of 
alllPI contributions to the photon 2-point function in Lorenz gauge; and -ie Rret (p) is the 
sum of alllPI contributions to the 3-point function (1f;Aet'lj;) with p the photon momentum. 
The first two conditions fix the electron propagator to 
. 
i 
2G(p) = 
. + regular at p = mp; 
p-mp +2c. 
(19.64) 
the third condition fixes the renormalized electric charge eR to be what is measured by 
Coulomb's law at large distances. The final condition forces the photon propagator to be 
_igetV 
iGILV(p) = -2--' + petpV pieces + regular at p = mp. 
p + 2c. 
(19.65) 
These four conditions give non-perturbative definitions for the four free parameters, eo, 
Z2, Z3 and mo, in the QED Lagrangian. 
The four renormalization conditions listed above are not the only way to define the coun-
terterms in QED. In fact, as discussed in Chapter 18, any definition for counterterms that 
differs from these by only finite parts will also remove all the infinities in these Green's 
functions. Different conventions for the finite parts of counterterms are known as different 
subtraction schemes. In minimal subtraction, the finite parts of the counterterms are set to 
zero. In modified minimal subtraction, which is used in conjunction with dimensional regu-
larization, the only finite parts that are kept are the In( 47f) and ,E factors, which effectively 
convert jl back to f.L in unrenormalized amplitudes. 
In dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction, the QED counterterms are

This is a finite function, but depends on an arbitrary parameter fL. 
An important point, which is often confused, is that there are two scales involved in an 
renormalization: the cutoff scale A, which is taken to infinity, and a finite low-energy scal~ 
fL, the subtraction point. A has to do with the way the theory is deformed in the uv to 
Imake it convergent, and we can always take the limit A ----; 00 (after renormalization). fJ, is 
related to the renormalization condition. In the on-shell scheme, fL is implicit. For example 
in the on-shell scheme in the electron self-energy, mR is set equal to the pole mass; thi~ 
is effectively the choice fL = mp. For the photon, fL = O. Neither scale A nor fL can eVer 
affect a physical calculation, but for different reasons. A can never matter, because it is 
entirely unphysical and we always take A ----; 00 after renormalization. fL can never matter 
because the subtraction point is arbitrary. 
Let us recap the different quantities we have introduced related to renormalization: 
• The renormalized mass mR and electric charge eR are parameters in the Lagrangian 
of renormalized perturbation theory used in calculations. They are finite, but only well-
defined after a set of renormalization conditions or, equivalently, a subtraction scheme 
is introduced. 
• The counterterms 61, 62, 63 and 6m come from expanding the bare parameters in the 
un-renormalized QED Lagrangian around their tree-level values. The divergent parts of 
the counterterms depend on the regulator but not on the subtraction scheme. The finite 
parts of the counterterms depend on the subtraction scheme. 
• The cutoff A or ~ is an unphysical scale used to make formally divergent quantities finite 
in a consistent way. The divergent part of the cutoff dependence cancels between loop 
graphs and counterterm graphs. After this cancellation, the cutoff can be taken to 00. 
• The subtraction point fL allows for a one-parameter family of renormalization con-
ditions. Physical predictions that relate observables to other observables must be 
independent of fL. 
19.5 Z1 = Z2: implications and proof 
We found by explicit calculation that the two counterterms 61 and 62 were exactly equal 
at order e~. This was true with the counterterms defined in the on-shell scheme, where 61 
was fixed by rl-' = ,I-' and 62 was fixed by ~/ (mp) = 0, where mp is the electron pole 
mass. The two loops required to determine 61 and 62 were the IPI vertex correction and the 
IPI electron self-energy graph. Now, we will understand why these seemingly unrelated 
. calculations are in fact very closely connected. 

eo 
19.5 Z1 = Z2: implications and proof 
first, note that 61 = 62 implies Zl = Z2. Recalling Eq. (19.7), Zl == Ze Z2)Z:;' where 
:::' ZeeR, it follows that 
(19.68) 
ThUS, the renormalization of the electric charge is determined completely by the renor-
alization of the photon field strength. This explains why we were able to calculate 
:e renormalization of the electric charge from only the vacuum polarization graphs in 
Chapter 16. 
There is an important physical implication of Zl = Z2. Suppose we have a theory with 
tWO different kinds of particles: for example, a quark with charge Q q = ~ and an electron 
with charge Q e = -1. The Lagrangian including both fields is 
If Zle = Z2e and Zlq = Z2q for both the electron and quark, then this Lagrangian is 
(19.70) 
Thus, Zl = Z2 implies that the relationship between the coefficient of ifft and of eR-J does 
not receive radiative corrections. In other words, the ratio of charges of the electron and 
the quark is the same in the quantum theory as they would be classically. 
This is pretty remarkable. It explains why the observed charge of the proton and the 
charge of the electron can be exactly opposite, even in the presence of vastly different 
interactions of the two particles. A priori, we might have suspected that, because of strong 
interactions and virtual mesons surrounding the proton, the types of radiative corrections 
for the proton would be vastly more complicated than for the electron. But, as it turns out, 
this does not happen - the renormalization of the photon field strength rescales the electric 
charge, but the corrections to the relative charges of the proton and the electron cancel. 
For a quick way to see that Zl = Z2 to all orders, first rescale AI-' ----+ e~ AI-" Then the 
Lagrangian becomes 
At tree-level, with Zi = 1, this Lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformations 
(19.72) 
Note that the charges, Q i = -1, ~, appear in the transformation law but e R does not. 
Second, observe that the transformation has nothing to do with perturbation theory. Since 
the Lagrangian is gauge invariant as long as the regulator preserves gauge invariance, the 
loop corrections will be gauge invariant, and the counterterms should respect the symmetry 
too. That is, since charge is conserved at each vertex, it will be conserved in all the loops.

Renormalized perturbation theory 
19.5.1 All-orders proof of Z1 = Z2 
--..... 
A more formal proof that ZI = Z2 to all orders follows from the Ward-Takahashi identit 
In terms ofrenormalized fields, the Ward-Takahashi identity from Eq. (14.143) reads 
Y. 
(19.73) 
where 
M'" (p, ql, q2) == J 
d4x d4xl d4x2 eipx eiq,x, e-iq2x2 (1'" (x )'IjJ(Xl)ijJ(X2)) , 
(19.74) 
with j'" = '0,'"'IjJ and 
MO(ql,q2) == J 
d4xld4x2eiQ1Xle-iq2X2('IjJ(xdijJ(X2))' 
(19.75) 
Comparing Mo to the definition of G(~) in Eq. (19.17), 
('IjJ(x)ijJ(y)) = J 
(~:~4e-iQ(X-Y)iG(~), 
(19.76) 
we see that MO(ql, q2) = (2;r)484(ql - q2)iG(qIl) so that 
p,"M'"(p, ql, q2) = (2;r)4 84(p + ql - q2) [G(p + q/l) - G(q/l)]. 
(19.77) 
Next, we can relate M'" to the vertex correction. Recall that -'--ieRr'" was defined in 
Eq. (19.42) as the sum of 1PI contributions to matrix elements for the 3-point function 
('IjJ(xdAv(x)ijJ(X2)) with the external legs amputated, but not assuming the photon is 
on-shell. In this proof, we will need to take the limit where all the particles go on-shell 
carefully, so let us first generalize r'" to also allow for off-shell spinors. r'" can be formally 
defined as 
-ieRr'"(p, ql, q2) (2;r)4 84(p + ql - q2) == -ieR J 
d4x d4xl d4x2 eipxeiq,x'e-iQ2x2 
x (iG)-I(qIl) (j'"(X)'IjJ(Xl)ijJ(X2)) (iG)-I(p + qIl), 
(19.78) 
with iG(~) the 2-point function defined in Eqs. (19.17). Since this Green's function sums 
all the 1PI corrections to off-shell propagators, multiplying by its inverse amputates these 
propagators. Note that this is a more general amputation than what is done for S-matrix 
elements; for S -matrix elements, the external states are on-shell, so we would just use the 
on-shell renormalization conditions replacing G- 1 (~) by ~ - mp. 
Using Eqs. (19.74) and (19.78) we then get 
- G-1(q/l)M'"(p, ql, q2) G-1(p + qjd = (2;r)4r'"(p, ql, q2) 84(p + ql - q2). (19.79) 
Contracting with p'" lets us combine this with Eq. (19.77) to give 
G(p + qIl)-1 - G(q/l)-1 = p,"r'"(p, Ql, Q2). 
Next, we use that G(~) -1 = ~ - mp + ~(~) by Eq. (19.22) to get 
p + ~(qIl + p) -
~(~1) = p,"r'"(p, Ql, Q2).

are scheme independent. Note, however, that one can choose a more exotic subtraction 
scheme in which Zl = Z2 does not hold. 
By the way, there is a somewhat simpler way to connect the renormalization factors 
to the counterterms which employs the notation of an effective Lagrangian. Effective 
Lagrangians will be discussed in detail in Part IV. For now, let us simply observe that 
there exists a Lagrangian, 
(19.83) 
which produces at tree-level the identical 2- and 3-point functions that renormalized QED 
produces at loop level. Because fl' (p) can have In p2 terms and suchlike, this effec-
tive Lagrangian is non-local. The renormalization conditions let us match this effective 
Lagrangian on to the original renormalized Lagrangian, 
at large distances. In particular, the condition fl'(O) = ,I' implies that 
and the on-shell renormalized electron propagator is

19.1 Evaluate the four counterterms in scalar QED at I-loop in the on-shell scheme.

19.3 Prove Yang's theorem: a massive vector boson can never decay into two photons h 
. rOr 
the proof, you only need to consider the most general possible form the amplitude 
could have, not any particular Lagrangian or Feynman rules. 

We have shown that the 1-, 2- and 3-point functions in QED are UV finite at I-loop. We 
were able to introduce four counterterms (om, 01, 02, 03) that canceled all the infinities. 
Now let us move on to 4-point functions, such as 
(20.1) 
This could represent, for example, M¢ller scattering (e- e-
---7 C e-) or Bhabha scattering 
(e+e-
---7 e+e-). We will take it to be e+e- ---711+11- for simplicity, since at tree-level 
this process only has an s-channel diagram. Looking at these 4-point functions at I-loop 
will help us understand how to combine previous loop calculations and counterterms into 
new observables, and will also illustrate a new feature: cancellation of IR divergences. 
Recall that in the on-shell subtraction scheme we found 01 and 02 depended on a fic-
titious photon mass, m,. This mass was introduced to make the loops finite and is an 
example of an IR regulator. As we will see, the dependence on IR regulators, such as m_p 
drops out not in differences between the Green's functions at different scales (as with UV 
regulators) but in the sum of different types of Green's functions contributing to the same 
observable at the same scale. 
The general principle by which IR divergences cancel is the same as the principle by 
which UV divergences cancel: only physical, observable quantities are guaranteed to be 
finite. For UV divergences, it turns out that a simple proxy for the set of observables is the 
set of Green's functions of renormalized fields (¢1 (Xl )¢2 (X2) ... ). These Green's func-
tions are not observable, and often not gauge invariant, but are still UV finite. For IR 
divergences, Green's functions are not good enough. In fact, S-matrix elements or even 
differences of S-matrix elements at different scales are not good enough. As we will see, 
IR divergences only generally cancel after cross sections for processes involving different 
initial or final states are combined. 
In this chapter, we will perform one of the most important calculations in QED. We will 
show that although the cross section for the 2 ---7 2 process e+ e- ---711+ 11- is IR divergent 
at order eA, as is the cross section for the related 2 ---7 3 process e+e- ---711+11-" their 
sum is IR finite. More precisely, we will find from calculating

We will see how having to sum over final states (and sometimes initial states) With 
different particle multiplicities is related to a muon not being physically separable frorn its 
surrounding cloud of soft photons. Trying to make this photon cloud more precise leads 
natmally to the notion of jets. Similarly, trying to understand the initial state radiation 
contribution leads naturally to the notion of parton distribution functions. The total cross 
section calculation is so important that we will calculate it two ways, with a Pauli-Villars 
UV regulator and a photon mass IR regulator, and with dimensional regularization for both 
the UV and the IR, showing that the total cross section is regulator independent. 
At leading order, the cross section for e+ e-

(20.4) 
where Q2 = (PI + P2)2 = E~ ~d = s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

energy limit, Q » me, mIL' the differential cross section is (Eq. (13.78)) 
da 
ek

drl = 647r2Q2 (1 + cos 0). 
(20.5) 
The total tree-level cross section is then a simple integral: 
(20.6) 
What we would like to calculate is the next-to-Ieading-order correction to ao, which begins 
at O(a3 ). 

for an S-matrix calculation, only amputated graphs are necessary (see Section 18.3.2). 
b·s case, there are five relevant I-loop graphs in QED: 
111 t 1 
(20.7) 
Tbe next -to-leading order 0 (003) result is the interference between these graphs (of order 
,2) and the original graph (of order a). 
0: In addition to loop corrections to the 4-point function, we will also need to calculate 
al emission graphs to cancel the IR divergences. Real emission graphs correspond to 
re 
-
rocesses that are the same order in perturbation theory as the loops but involve more final 
~tate particles. We will do the loops first, then the real emission graphs, and then show that 
we can take m, ---> 0 after all the contributions are combined into the full cross section 
illol == 0-( e+ e- ---> p,+ Ie (+,)). 
An important simplifying observation is that since, as far as QED is concerned, the elec-
tron and muon charges, Qe and QI-" can be anything, the IR divergence must cancel order 
by order in Qe and QI-' separately. The tree-level cross section scales as 0-0 
rv Q~Q~. 
The loops in Eq. (20.7) scale as QeQ~, Q~QI-" Q~Q~, Q~Q~ and QeQI-'Q~ respectively, 
where Q x is the charge of the particles going around the vacuum polarization loop, which 
can be anything. In particular, we will focus on the cancellation of divergences propor-
tional to o-oQeQ~. This cancellation gives the critical demonstration of IR finiteness, and 
is phenomenologically relevant. Other loop contributions will be discussed afterwards.

The vertex correction is

(20.8) 
where pI-' = pi + p~ is the photon momentum entering the vertex with p2 = Q2. In this 
equation, r~ (p) refers to the 0 (e) contribution to the IPI vertex function, for which we do 
not introduce any new subscripts for readability. Conveniently, we already computed r~(p) 
for a general off-shell photon in Section 19.3, so we can just copy over those results. 
Recall from Section 19.3 that the general vertex function fl-'(p) can be parametrized in 
terms of two form factors:

In the high-energy limit, ~2 -+ 00, this form factor vanishes, F2 (p2) -+ O. This lnakes 
sense, since F2 couples right- and left-handed spinors, which are uncoupled in massless 
QED. 
The first form factor was both UV and IR divergent. Regulating the UV divergence in 
Fl(p2) with Pauli-Villars and the IR divergence with a photon mass, we found that

Note that the In A 2 has the right coefficient to be canceled by 01. More generally, the diver-
gences in the vertex correction and 01 will always cancel for arbitrarily complicated pro-
cesses involving a photon-fermion vertex. This is simply because the divergent part of the 
counterterm was determined by calculating the IPI contributions to (SliT {'lj;AiJ. 7/i} I D). 
In the divergent region of loop momentum, the external scales are irrelevant. Thus, the 
divergences for the 3-point function are the same whether or not it is embedded in a larger 
diagram, and therefore they will always be canceled by 01.

To evaluate the cross section at next-to-Ieading order, we need the first subleading term

(20.21) 
In the high-energy limit in which we are interested, the al"v term in fl" gives an odd number 
of ,-matrices in the second trace, forcing the contribution of the F2 form factor to vanish. 
This is consistent with F2 itself vanishing for p2 » m 2. So we have simply

In this difference, all the subtraction-scheme-dependent constants drop out. However, IR. 
divergent logarithms remain. This is because differences of logarithms are the logarithm Of 
a ratio but differences of double logarithms are not a double logarithm of a ratio. As We Win 
see, the resolution is that a cross section like this is not in fact an observable: only When 
we include contributions of proceses with different final states can we find an observable 
that is independent of m,. 
20.1.2 Real emission graphs

Next, we calculate the cross section for e+e-
---+ J-L+J-L-'. To fourth order in the muon 
charge, the only diagrams have the photon coming off a muon: 
iM= 
P, + 
(20.25) 
The cross section for this process starts off at order Q! Q~ e~, so it is the same order at 
tree-level as the interference between e+ e- ---+ J-L+ J-L- at tree-level and at I-loop. 
The diagrams give, in the limit Q » m in Feynman gauge,

where in this case,

(20.30) 
(20.31) 
Now note that pI" Ll"v = pI" XI" V = 
O. This would be true even if we did not sum 
over spins (by the Ward identity for the intermediate photon). In particular, since XI"V is 
a Lorentz-covariant function only of pI" (the other momenta are integrated over), it must 
have the form 
XI"V = (pl"pV _ p2gl"v) X (p2) . 
(20.32) 
Then, using Eq. (20.29) we find 
1 
Ll"v XI" V = (pip~ + prp~ - 2p2g1"V) (pl"pV - p2gl"v) X (p2)

where 0"0 = 12:RQ2 is the tree-level cross section for e+ e- ----+ JL+ JL - from before. 
We have conveniently included dIIL1PS in XI"V so that its definition would be equivalent 
to the cross section for,* ----+ JL+ JL-" where,* is a photon of mass Q. That is, 
e2 
r(,* ----+ JL+JL-,) = - 2:!?l"vX l"v. 
(20.35) 
One can interpret the - 9 I"V in this last formula as a sum over polarizations of the off-shell 
photon, which can mean either a transverse polarization sum or a sum over all polariza-
tions; since pI" XI"V = 0 the unphysical polarizations do not contribute. The result is that 
the unpolarized cross section factors into e+ e-
----+ ,*, which gives just a normalization 
since there is no phase space, and,* ----+ JL+ JL- f. More precisely, 
O"R = O"O[et~r(,* ----+ JL+JL-,)] . 
(20.36) 
This is a useful general result: since we sum over spins, all spin correlations between the 
initial and final state average out and the cross section can be calculated by considering two 
sub-processes, the creation and subsequent decay of an intermediate state. This is actually 
a special case of the narrow-width approximation, to be discussed in Section 24.1.4.

We have reduced the problem to the calculation of O"(ry* ---> p,+ P,- 1 ) in the 1 * res

where (3 == Qi. (In general, s + t + u = L m; and here only 1* and the real outgoing

The Xi variables are easier to use in this calculation than s, t and u. They can be thought 
of as the energy of the outgoing states in the 1* rest frame. For example,

We have found that the sum of the e+ e-

the graphs H + K ' 
and the e+e-
---+ 11+11-, cross section aR also at order 
e~ from the graphs K + k, 
was IR and UV finite. Photons emitted frolb. 
final state particles, such as the muons in this case, are known as final state radiation. The 
explanation of why one has to include final state radiation to get a finite cross section is 
that it is impossible to tell whether the final state in a scattering process is just a muon Or 
a muon plus an arbitrary number of soft or collinear photons. Trying to make this more 
precise leads naturally to the notion of jets. 
For simplicity, we calculated only the total cross section for e+ e- annihilation into 
states containing a muon and antimuon pair, inclusive over an additional photon. One Could 
also calculate something less inclusive. For example, experimentally, a muon might be 
identified as a track in a cloud chamber or an energy deposition in a calorimeter. So one 
could calculate the cross section for the production of a track or energy deposition. This 
cross section gets contributions from different processes. Even with an amazing detector, 
there will be some lower limit Eres on the energy of photons that can be resolved. Even for 
energetic photons, if the photon is going in exactly the same direction as the muon there 
would be no way to resolve it and the muon separately. That is, there will be some lower 
limit eres on the angle that can be measured between either muon and the photon. 
With these experimental parameters,

cuts, even with m, = 0, is complicated enough to be unilluminating. The result, which we

Sterman-Weinberg jet. 
sterman-Weinberg jets are not the most useful jet definition in practice. There are many 
otber ways to define a jet. Any definition is acceptable as long as it allows a separation 
into finite cross sections for (J2--->2 (the two-jet rate), (J2--->3 (the three-jet rate), and (J2--->n 
(the n-jet rate), which starts at higher order in perturbation theory. A jet definition simpler 
than Sterman-Weinberg simply puts a lower bound on the invariant mass of the photon-
muon pair, (p, + p!-,±) 2 > My. This single parameter limits both the collinear and soft 
singularities. An invariant mass cutoff is sometimes known as a JADE jet after the JADE

where the M J « Q limit has been taken in the second line. One does not have to take this 
limit; however, the limit shows, as with Eq. (20.57), a general result: 
• In physical cross sections, an experimental resolution parameter acts as an IR regulator. 
In other words, we did not need to introduce m,. In practice, it is much easier to calculate 
the total cross section using m, than by using a more physical regulator associated with 
the details of an experiment. 
An important qualitative feature of results such as the two- or three-jet rates is that for

would be of the same order. Thus, to be able to compare to experiment, 
one should not take M J too small. As a concrete example, the experiment BABAR at 
SLAC measured the decay of B mesons to kaons and photons (B ---> K "y). This experi-
lllent was sensitive only to photons harder than Eres = 1.8 GeV In other words, it could 
not distinguish a kaon in the final state from a kaon plus a photon softer than this energy.

tatively important effect. Since the logarithm is large, higher orders in perturbation theor 
are also important. The summation of these Sudakov double logarithms to all orders in pe;' 
turbation theory was an important impetus for the development of new powerful theoretical 
tools, in particular, Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (see Chapter 36) in the 2000s. 
While these muon-photon packets are hard to see in QED, they are easy to see in QeD 
In QCD, the muon is replaced by a quark and the photon replaced by a gluon. The qUark 
itself and the additional soft gluons turn into separate observable particles, such as pions 
and kaons. Thus, a quark in QCD turns into ajet of hadrons. These jets are a very real and 
characteristic phenomenon of all high-energy collisions. We have explained their existence 
by studying the infrared singularity structure of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory. 
In modem collider physics, it is common to look not at the rate for jet production far 
a fixed resolution parameter, but instead to look at the distribution of jets themselves. 1'0 
do this, one needs to define a jet through a jet algorithm. For example, one might cluster 
together any observed particles closer than some eres ' The result would be a set of jets of 
angular size eres . Then one can look at the distribution of properties of those jets, such as 
d:
J
' where mJ is the jet mass defined as the invariant mass of the sum of the 4-momenta 
of all the particles in the jet. It turns out that such distt'ibutions have a peak at some finite 
value of mJ. However, at any order in perturbation theory, one would just find results such 
as dda 
= _I_ln mQ.} , which grow arbitrarily large at small mass. Calculating the mass 
mJ 
mJ 
distribution of jets therefore requires tools beyond perturbation theory, some of which are 
discussed in Chapter 36. 
20.3 Other loops 
Now let us return to the other loops in Eq. (20.7). The box and crossed box diagrams 
+ 
(20.58) 
are UV finite. To see this, note that the loop integrals for either graph will be of the form 
J 
d4k 1 1 1 1 J 
d4k 
(27r)4 k 2 k 2 r'¥: '" 
0 ' 
(20.59) 
where k » Pi has been taken to isolate the UV-divergent region. These graphs are therefore 
UV finite, so no renormalization is necessary. The interference of these graphs with the 
tree-level graph contributes at order Q~ and Q~ in the electron and muon charges, which 
is the same order as 

20.3 Other loops 
(20.60) 
d similar cross terms. Besides the UV finiteness of the loops, there is nothing qualita-
aU 
tively new in these graphs. You can explore them in Problem 20.5. 
20.3.1 Vacuum polarization correction 
--
Next, we consider the vacuum polarization graph and its counterterm: 
iM" ~ H'H· 
(20.61) 
The interference between the tree-level amplitude for e+ e-
---7 p,+ p,- and these graphs 
gives a contribution to the cross section at order e~. This contribution is proportional to 
the square of the charges of whatever particle is going around the loop. For a loop involving 
a generic charge, there are no corresponding real emission graphs of the same order in that 
charge; thus, any IR divergences must cancel between these graphs alone. 
We evaluated these graphs in Section 16.2 (and in Section 19.2.1) for an off-shell photon. 
Copying over those results, the sum of the loop and its counterterms in this case gives an 
interference contribution 2Re (MoMfJ), which leads to a correction to the cross section 
of the form 
(20.62)

(20.63) 
For this physical application we have to sum over all particles j with masses mj and 
charges Qj that can go around the loop. This sum therefore includes electrons, muons, 
quarks, and everything else with electric charge in the Standard Model. 
A more suggestive way to write the vacuum polarization contribution is through an effec-
tive charge. Recall that it was these same vacuum polarization graphs that contributed to 
the running of the Coulomb potential. In the Coulomb potential, the virtual photon is space-
like, with _p2 > O. In Chapter 16, we found that for _p2 » m 2 the effective charge at 
I-loop was (Eq. (16.65)) 
(20.64) 
with the convention that eR == eeff( -m2 ). 
367

Infrared divergences 
Now look at the correction to the cross section, with just one virtual fermion f 
simplicity and Q2 » m2. Then we can use 
Or

Now recalling eTo (Q 
= 127rQ2 we find 
eT(Q2) = 12:~2 {I + 2Re [1~~2 In j2] + o(e~)} 
= 12:Q2!ek + 1~~2 In ~~2!2 + O(e~) 
= 12:Q2 leeff( _Q2) 14 + O(e~ff( _Q2)). 
(20.65) 
(20.66) 
Including the final state radiation and virtual correction from the muon vertex, we also have

eT 
127rQ2 
167r2 
eeff , 
(20.67) 
and thus 
The entire effect of the vacuum polarization graph is encapsulated in the scale-dependent 
effective charge. 
This is true quite generally (as long as the electron mass can be neglected) and explains 
why an effective charge is such a useful concept. 
You may have noticed that in the limit m ----+ 0 the effective charge in Eq. (20.67) appears 
to be IR divergent. However, since

(20.68) 
as long as the effective charge measured at some scale is finite, the charge at any other 
scale will be finite. In particular, we can measure the charge before neglecting the electron 
mass, then run the charge up to high energy. Or more simply, measure the electric charge 
through the e+e-
----+ p,+ p,- cross section at some scale Q1 and predict the effect at Q2 
(if we do this, however, the finite effect from the vertex correction and final state radiation 
contribution cannot be measured). 
Although we only showed the agreement for a single virtual fermion, since the same 
vacuum polarization graphs correct Coulomb's law as correct the e+ e-
----+ p,+ p,- croSS 
section, the agreement will hold with arbitrary charged particles. If there are many par-
ticles, it is unlikely that Q will be much much larger than all their massess. Of course, 
if Q « mj for some mass, that particle has little effect (the logarithm in Eq. (20.63) 
goes to zero). But we may measure the cross section at various Q above and beloW 
some particle thresholds. In this case, the effective charge changes, sometimes even dis-
continuously. Physical observables (such as cross sections) are not discontinuous, since

to account for a large part of the approximate doubling of the pp ---+ e+ e- cross section at 
next-to-leading order [Magnea and Sterman, 1990]. 
20.3.2 Initial state radiation 
Finally, we need to discuss the contributions to the e+ e-
---+ p,+ p, - (r) cross section to 
third order in the electron charge and first order in the muon charge. In other words, the 
following diagrams: 
(20.69) 
In the same way that final state radiation was necessary to cancel the IR singularity of the 
vertex correction involving the photon, the sum of these diagrams will be finite. The radi-
ation coming off the electrons in this process is known as initial state radiation. These 
real emission graphs are closely related to the real emission graphs with the photon com-
ing off the muons, and their integrals over phase space have IR divergences. However, the 
IR-divergent region is a little different and the physical interpretation of the divergences is 
very different. 
Let us suppose that the sum of the diagrams in Eq. (20.69) gives a finite total cross 
section for e+ e- ---+ p,+ p,-( +y) we call Utat. Then we should be able to calculate a more 
exclusive two-jet cross section, as in the previous section, for producing less than Eres 
of energy outside of cones of half-angle eres around the muons. In this case, however, 
there is no collinear singularity with the photons going collinearly to the muons. Instead, 
the IR divergences come from the intermediate electron propagator going on-shell. This 
propagator has a factor of 
2 The effective charge is regulator and subtraction scheme dependent. In the on-shell scheme, the effective charge 
is very difficult to calculate through particle thresholds. It is therefore more common to use dimensional regu-
larization with minimal subtraction to define the effective charge. In particular, in QeD, where the thresholds 
are very important for the effective strong coupling constant as, !'vIS is almost exclusively used, and there the 
effective charge is known to 4-100p order.

and a photon with w > Eres , we would find an unregulated collinear singularity associated 
with ee, ----70 and both 0"2--->3 and 0"2--->2 are therefore infinite! 
As you might guess, we are missing something. First of all, the collinear singularity does 
not actually produce an infinite cross section since it is cut off by the electron mass (the 
electron mass does not regulate the w ----7 0 soft divergence, just the collinear divergence). 
We actually already calculated a similar cross section with finite m for Compton Scatter_ 
ing e -, ----7 e -,. Indeed, it is easy to see that the collinear singUlarities associated with 
an intermediate electron going on-shell are the same in the two processes. For Compton 
scattering, we found in Section 13.5 that the differential cross section for w » m Was,

This is finite, although extremely large as ~ ----7 00. The cross section 0"2---73 for e+ e-
---7 
p,+ P, -, would have a similar factor. 
What are we to make of this large In ~ factor? For final state radiation, as long as 
Eres and eres were not very small, the cross section for 0"2---73 was not too large. More 
importantly, it was independent of the electron mass. In fact, it is intuitively obvious that 
the electron mass should be irrelevant to the cross section at high energy. So why is it 
appearing here? 
The resolution of this dilemma is easiest to understand by thinking about scattering pro-
tons instead of electrons (this part may not make sense until you have made it through 
Chapter 32). A proton is superficially made up of two up quarks and one down quark, 
but really it is a complicated bound state of those quarks interacting through the exchange 
of gluons, which are massless spin-l particles like the photon. When one collides pro-
tons at high energy, there is an interaction between one quark in one proton and one 
quark in another (or more generally, between gluons, quarks or antiquarks). But only a 
small fraction of the energy of the proton is usually involved in the scattering with the 
rest just passing through. One way to understand this is that the proton has a size of 
order rp = m:;;I ~ (1 GeV)-l. Thus, at energies Q » GeV, only a small dot of size 
Q-l « rp inside the big proton can be probed. In practice, it is impossible to calculate 
the probability that a certain quark will be involved in a short-distance collision, but we

tion. At ultra-high energies, when electrons and positrons collide, it is impossible for all 
a f the energy of the electron to go into the hard collision. Instead, only some fraction x 
~f the electron's energy will participate, with the rest of the energy continuing along the 
electron's direction in the form of radiation (photons). One can define functions fi(x , Q), 
where i = e- or I (or, technically speaking, anything else), that give the probability of 
finding object i inside an electron. In QED, these functions, sometimes called electron 
distribution functions (EDFs), are calculable. For example, the probability of finding 
a photon inside an electron with energy w = zQ in a collision at energy Q (assuming 
0 < z < 1) is 
J(z)= e~ [1+(1- Z)2]ln Q2 .

81r2 
z 
m 2 
(20.73) 
You can derive this in Problem 20.6. We will prove that this function is universal, in the 
sense that it gives the dominant behavior in the collinear limit for photon emission in any 
process, in Section 36.4. Using this function instead of a full matrix element is called the 
equivalent photon approximation or the Weizsacker-Williams approximation. 
If m « Q or if z « 1 then f, (z) is enormously large. In particular, when this loga-
rithm becomes bigger than ~, perturbation theory breaks down. The logarithms can be 
resummed in QED using theecfnalog of the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations (see Chap-
ter 32) for QED. In fact, the resummation of the large logarithms associated with initial 
state collinear singularities is quantitatively important for reproducing the line shape of the 
Z boson near resonance as measured by LEP (for a review, see [Peskin, 1990]). 
Another way to think about EDFs is that they include the effects of graphs such as 
+ 
(20.74) 
in which the photon is in the initial state. In these the collinear singularity is naturally 
cut off by the electron mass, or the IR regulator if the electron is massless. Either way, the 
incoming radiation represents the electron containing a photon, which is parametrized with 
theEDFs. 
How do we deal with the initial state collinear singularity in practice? It turns out that, 
for real experiments, the details of the EDFs and how the initial state IR divergences can-
cel are almost never important. For example, consider the LEP collider at CERN, which 
ran during the 1990s. For much of its life, this machine collided electrons and positrons 
at a center-of-mass energy near the Z-boson mass: Q ~ 91 GeV. At this energy the 
Z boson is produced resonantly, almost always involving all of the energy of the elec-
trons, with no phase space left for initial state radiation. Actually, since the electrons

ticular, the branching ratio for Z -4 bb has proven a particularly powerful way to look 
for physics beyond the Standard Model, since it happens to be sensitive not just to loops 
involving electrons, but also to loops involving hypothetical particles (such as charged 
Higgses). On the other hand, if you want to calculate the line shape of the Z boson in the 
resonance region, then initial state radiation is important. Indeed, the importance of the 
large logatithms, as in Eq. (20.72) has been experimentally validated of LEP. 
By the way, there is actually an interesting difference between initial state radiation in 
QED and QeD. In QED, there is an important theorem due to Bloch and Nordsieck [BlOch 
and Nordsieck, 1937], which says: 
Bloch-Nordsieck theorem 
Infrared singularities will always cancel when summing over final state radi- ' 
ation in QED with a massive electron as long as there is a finite energy 
resolution. 
In QeD, this is not true. At 2-100ps, IR singularities in QeD with massive quarks will 
not cancel summing over 2 -4 n processes only; one also needs to sum over 3 -t n 
processes [Doria et aI., 1980]. The uncanceled singularity, however, vanishes as a power 
of the quat'k mass and therefore disappears as ~q -4 O. Thus, in the high-energy limit of 
QeD, where the mass can be neglected, one can get an IR-finite answer summing only 
cross sections with two particles in the initial state. (This result has nothing to do with 
QeD being asymptotically free, and would hold even if there were enough flavors so that 
QeD were infrared free, like QED.) 
A more general theorem, due to Kinoshita, Lee and Nauenberg (KLN) [Kinoshita, 1962; 
Lee and Nauenberg, 1964] is that 
Kinoshita-lee-Nauenberg (KLN) theorem 
Infrared divergences will cancel in any unitary theory when all possible final 
and initial states in a finite energy window are summed over. 
The KLN theorem is mostly of formal interest, since we do not normally sum over initial 
states when computing cross sections. Proofs of the Bloch- Nordsieck and KLN theorems 
can be found in [Sterman, 1993].

The first step is to calculate the tree-level cross section in d = 4 - c dimensions. It is of 
course non-singular as c ---7 0; however, we will need the O(c) parts of the cross section 
for the virtual correction. We work in the limit ECM = Q » me, m," so that we can treat 
the fermions as massless. We first write an expression for a general e+ e-

Finally, we need the counterterm in the on-shell scheme (we need to use the on-shell 
scheme if we are to identify eR with the charge measured at Q = 0). The graph gives

which is finite as c ---+ 0 and exactly the result we found with Pauli-Villars and a photon

20.1 Derive the phase space formula in Eq. (20.42). 
20.2 Calculate the Sterman-Weinberg jet rates in Eqs. (20.55) and (20.56). 
20.3 Calculate the total cross section for e+ e -

radiation contribution. 
20.4 Calculate the cross section for e+ e-

20.5 Calculate the box and crossed box loop graphs in Eq. (20.58). Are they IR divergent? 
20.6 Calculate the splitting function for the QED function in Eq. (20.73). 

At this point, we have calculated some 2-, 3- and 4-point functions in QED where we found 
three UV-divergent I-loop graphs: 
(21.1) 
We saw that these UV divergences were artifacts of not computing something physical, 
since the UV-divergent answer was calculated using parameters in a Lagrangian that were 
not defined based on observables. More precisely, we saw that the normalizations of the 
electron and photon fields were not observable, and so these fields could be rescaled by 
wavefunction renormalization factors Z2 = 1 + 82 and Z3 = 1 + 83, with the coun-
terterms 83 and 82 dependent on the UV regularization and subtraction scheme. We also 
saW that the bare electric charge parameter eo appearing in the Lagrangian and the bare 
Lagrangian electron mass parameter ma could be redefined keeping physical quantities 
(such as the charge measured by Coulomb's law at large distances and the location of the 
pole in the electron propagator) finite. This introduced two new counterterms, 81 and 8m . 
We found that these same counterterms, and the four associated renormalization condi-
tions that define them to all orders in perturbation theory, made all the 2-, 3- and 4-point 
functions we have so far considered finite. 
The next question we will address is: Will this always be the case? Can these same 
four counterterms remove all of the infinities in QED? If so, QED is renormalizable. The 
general definition of renormalizable is 
• 
-. 
- Renormalizable
' 
. 
, 
In a renormalizable theory, all UV divergences can be canceled with a finite 
number of counterterms. 
It will not be hard to show that QED is renormalizable at I-loop. The impOliant observation 
is that UV divergences are the same whether or not the extemallegs are on-shell; they come 
from regions of loop momenta with k » Pi for any external momentum Pi. In pariicular, 
the same counterterms will cancel the UV divergences of divergent graphs even when the 
I-loop graphs are subgraphs in more complicated higher-order cOlTelation functions. We 
saw this explicitly in Chapter 20 for e+ e- --t p,+ p,- : the counterterms we derived from 2-
and 3-point functions removed the UV divergences in this 4-point case.

more useful for our pre ent purpose , is 
One-particle irreducible (1 PI) 
~ 
A Feynman diagram is 1 PI if all internal lines have some loop momentum 
going through them. 
Any graph involved in the computation of any Green's function can be computed by 
sewing together IPI graphs, with off-shell momenta, without doing any additional inte-
grals. Thus, ifthe four QED counterterms cancel all the UV divergences in IPI graphs, they 
will cancel the UV divergences in any Green's function. Keep in mind that for S-matrix 
elements we need to compute all (amputated) graphs, but for studying general properties 
of renormalizability it is enough to consider only the IPI graphs. 
It will be useful to consider a quantity D, the superficial degree of divergence, defined 
as the overall power of loop momenta ki in the loop integrals, including the powers of ki 
in the various d4k i . For example, we say J d4kk-2 has D = 2 and J d4kl J d4k2k14k24 
has D = O. If we cut off all the components of all the k~ at a single scale A, then a graph 
with degree of divergence D scales as AD as we take A ---+ 00 and as In A for D = O. 
21.1 Renormalizability of QED 
To approach renormalizability, we will continue our systematic study of removing infinities 
in Green's functions (which we began in Chapter 19), focusing on IPI graphs. We have 
already shown that the QED counterterms cancel the UV divergences in all the 2- aod 
3-point functions in QED. SO now we continue to 4-point and higher-point functions. 
21.1.1 Four-point functions 
Let us first consider the Green's function with four fermions, (OIT {;j;'Ij;;j;'Ij;} 10). We eval-
uated this correlation function in Chapter 20 for e+ e-
---+ p.,+ p.,- and found it to be UV 
finite. The only IPI graph contributing to the scattering amplitude based on the 4-point 
function is

of divergence. Thl! , for J -l op I PI graphs, if D < 0 the graph is not UV divergent. 
Next, the lPI contribution to the two-fernlion and two-photon Green's function is

This has D = -1 and is also not UV divergent. 
Finally, the last non-vanishing 4-point function is the four-photon function, which 
describes light-by-light scattering ii ---+ iT 
(21.4) 
This one has D = 
0 and appears logarithnlically divergent. However, we know that 
after regulating and performing the integrals, the result must be linear in the four photon 
polarizations and therefore have the form 
(21.5) 
By Lorentz invariance, dimensional analysis, and symmetry under the interchange of the 
photons, MI-'vpu must have the form 
(21.6) 
for some constant c. We also know by the Ward identity that this must vanish when any 
one of the photons is replaced by its momentum. Say AI-' has momentum ql-" Then 
(21.7) 
This must hold for all ql-', which is impossible unless c = 0, and therefore this loop must 
be UV finite. (The loop is actually quite a mess to compute; the low-energy linlit of the 
result will be computed using effective actions in Chapter 33.)

they will have D < 0 and be UV finite. It no longer matters if the propagators are fOr 
fermions or photons; any graph with more than four legs will always have more than fOur 
powers of k in the denominator. 
In conclusion, the four counterterms, 61,62,63 and 6m , suffice to cancel all the diver_ 
gences in any Green's function of QED at I-loop. Therefore, QED is renormalizable at 
I-loop. 
21.1.3 Renormalizability to all orders 
What about 2-100p and higher-loop IPI graphs? One can show they are finite by induc-
tion. The full proof is rather involved, due to complications with overlapping and nested 
divergences from different types of multi-loop diagrams, so we will just sketch the basic 
ingredients. 
So far, we have found that there are only a finite number of UV-divergent IPI graphs at 
I-loop in QED coming from a finite number of divergent amplitudes. These divergences 
can be canceled by a finite number of counterterms. If higher-loop IPI graphs contribute 
divergences in the same amplitudes, these can be removed by the same counterterms (defin-
ing them to higher order in eR) . Thus, we have only to show that there cannot be any new 
divergent contributions to amplitudes that were UV finite at I-loop. 
First, let us show that the superficial degree of divergence does not change when more 
loops are added. To go from n to n + 1 loops, we can add either a photon propagator or a 
fermion propagator. If we add an internal photon propagator, 
(21.9) 
it must split two fermion lines, so the new loop has two additional fermion propagators as 
well. By the definition of IPI, loop momenta go through all internal lines. So for k » pi, 
where Pi is any external momentum, each internal line will get ~ or k12 • Then, the matriX 
element is modified to

(21.11) 
wbich gives 
(21.12) 
The new graph again has the same degree of divergence as the graph it was modifying. 
So a fermion insertion also does not change the superficial degree of divergence. Actually, 
as we show in the next section, the superficial degree of divergence depends only on the 
external particles in the process (this is essentially just dimensional analysis since the only 
scale available is A). 
The proof of renormalizability works by induction. Suppose that all the IPI graphs (with 
counterterms) are finite at n-loops. We have proved this for QED for n = 1. At n + 1 loops, 
you might imagine a situation in which some graph would be divergent despite it having 
D < O. For example, it could happen that two loop momenta come in as kl - k2 in the 
denominator, in which case the degree of divergence would depend on precisely how we 
take the momenta to infinity; if we take ki and k~ to infinity holding pI-' = ki -
k~ 
fixed, then there are fewer powers of kl-' in the denominator. However, in this case, pI-' 
can be treated as an external momentum and so one fewer loop momenta are integrated 
over; thus, the diagram has effectively only n loops, which we have already proved to be 
finite. Unfortunately, various subtleties and special cases make the proof somewhat tedious. 
The key result is the BHPZ theorem in Box 21.3. This theorem was mostly proved by 
Bogoliubov and Parasiuk in 1957, completed by Hepp in 1966 and refined by Zimmermann 
in 1970. See [Weinberg, 1995] for more details. 
~ . 
BPHZ theorem 
:AII divergences can be removed by counterterms corresponding to superfi-
Cially divergent 1 PI amplitudes. 
Since we have shown in QED that there are only a finite number of superficially 
divergent scattering processes at I-loop, that these divergences can be removed with the 
four counterterms <h) 02 ) 03 and om, and that the superficial degree of divergence of an 
amplitude does not increase from n to n + 1 loops, the BPHZ theorem then implies 
QED is renormalizable.

Renormalizabitity in QED means thal alJ Ule UV divergence are canceled by the Sa 
four counterl rm we introduced al I-loop. These ar fil by two number: the pby ical va~e 
of the electric charae n (measured in CouLomb' law at long di tance) and Ule phy 'ic~~ 
value of the electron mas , mp. The other two counterterms are fixed by normalizing th 
electron and photon field. Thi is actually a pretty ama:ting conclusion: QED i completel e 
pecified nee R and m p are measured; · after that, we can make an infinite number:r 
arbitrarily preci e prediction . . The tw inilial mea L1rement are needed to define even th 
classical theory. In the quantum theory, both logarithmic corrections can be calculated, suc~ 
as to the scale-dependent effective charge (Chapter 16), as well as finite corrections, SUch 
as to the value of the anomalous magnetic moment (Chapter 17) or the e+ e-
---+ fJ,+ fJ, -
total cross section (Chapter 20). 
Renormalizability played a very important role in the historical development of quan. 
tum field theory and gauge theories. In particular, 't Hooft's 1971 proof ['t Hooft, 1971] 
that spontaneously broken gauge theories were renormalizable made people take Wein. 
berg's model of leptons seriously. Weinberg's model, which has now evolved into the 
Standard Model, had been proposed in 1967 and was subsequently ignored over concerns 
of renormalizability. 
21.2 Non-renormalizable field theories 
All else being equal, renormalizability is a desirable property for a theory to have: an infi· 
nite number of predictions follow from a finite number of measurements. Unfortunately, to 
make these predictions we have to be able to perform computations in the renormalizable 
theory. In practice, this is extremely challenging. Not only are loops difficult to evaluate, 
but perturbation theory in the coupling constants of a renormalizable theory often breaks 
down. For example, as we saw in Section 16.3.2, QED has a Landau pole. Thus, Coulomb 
scatteling above E = 10286 eV is a completely mystery in QED. In other words, we can· 
not predict every observable just because we can cancel all the UV divergences. Moreover, 
precisely because QED is renormalizable, low-energy measurements are totally insensitive 
to whatever completion QED might have above the Landau pole. That is, we have no 
way of probing the mysterious high-energy regime without building a 10286 eV collider. 
Other renormalizable theories are unpredictive in much more relevant regimes. For exam-
ple, QCD does not make perturbative predictions below cv 1 Ge V. Or consider string theory, 
which is not only renormalizable but actually finite: it has no UV divergences. Despite its 
formal beauty, string theory has yet to relate any observable to any other observable at all. 
A more modern view is that if one is interested in actually making physical predic-
tions, renormalizability (or finiteness in the case of string theory) is somewhat irrelevant. 
I In pure QED, only one measurement would actually be needed, since the electron mass mp is dimensionful. 
This measurement would give ~:D' where AQED is the location of the Landau pole, which is in one. to-one 
correspondence with eR.

In many contexts, non-renormalizable theories are in fact much more useful than renor-
malizable ones, despite the fact that renormalizable theories have fewer parameters. To 
understand better the connection between renormalizability and predictability, we first have 
to examine non-renormalizable theOlies. We will study their UV divergence structure for 
the remainder of this chapter, and give a number of concrete examples in the next chap-
ter. Non-renormalizable theories will play an increasingly important role as we progress 
through Parts IV and V as well. 
21.2.1 Divergences in non-renormalizable theories 
We saw that in QED there are a finite number of superficially divergent one-particle 
irreducible contributions to off-shell scattering amplitudes. The superficial degree of diver-
gence of a scattering amplitude is well defined, because, as we showed in the previous 
section, inserting additional photon or fermion propagators into a loop does not change the 
degree of divergence. Call the superficial degree of divergence of a scattering amplitude 
with f fermions and b photons Df •b. Some example amplitudes and values of Dj,b are 
shown in Table 21.1. 
It is not hard to work out the general formula: 
3 
D j,b = 4 - 2 f - b. 
(21.13) 
With scalar external states, the generalization is 
Df b 
= 4 -
~f - b - s 
, ,s 
2 
) 
(21.14) 
Where s is the number of scalars being scattered. Divergent IPI graphs can only possibly 
Contribute to Green's functions with D > O. 
Besides counting loop momentum factors in integrals, another way to derive Eq. (21.13) 
is to recall that the LSZ reduction formula relates Green's functions to matrix elements by

(21.15) 
Since fennion have dimension ~ and photon dimen ion I, the actual Green' fuuction ha 
dimension ~f + b. The Xi and Yj integraJ and prefactors have mass dimension ~ 2b - 3/ 
and the o-functi n ha dimen ion - 4. Thu , the dim n i n f M i ~J + b - 2b - 3f ,. 4.

QED is a special theory because it only has a single interaction vertex: 
(21.16) 
The coefficient of this interaction is the dimensionless charge e. More generally, we might 
have a theory with couplings of arbitrary dimension. For example, 
(21.17) 
These additional couplings change the power counting. 
Call the mass dimension of the coefficient of the ith interaction .6.i . For example, the 
gl term above has .6. 1 = [gil = 1 and g2 has .6.2 = [g2] = -3. Now consider a loop 
contribution to a Green's function with ni insertions of the vertices with dimension .6.i . 
For k » Pi, the only scales that can appear are k's and .6.' s. So, by dimensional analysis, 
the superficial degree of divergence of the same integral changes as 
(21.18) 
Thus,

= 4 - - f - b - ~

(21.19)

So, if there are interactions with .6.i < 0, then there can be an infinite number of values of 
ni, and therefore an infinite number of values of f and b with D j,b,n, > O. This means that 
there are an infinite number of Green's functions for which some IPI graph has D > O. 
Thus, we will need an infinite number of counterterms to cancel all the infinities. Such 
theories are called non-renormalizable. 
We generalize this terminology also to describe individual interactions. We also some-
times describe interactions of dimension 0 as marginal, dimension > 0 as relevant, and 
dimension < 0 as irrelevant. These terms come from the Wilsonian renormalization group 
and will be discussed in Chapter 23. 
Non-renormalizable interactions are those of mass dimension .6.i < O. Having any non-
renormalizable interaction term in the Lagrangian makes a theory non-renormalizable. 
On the other hand, if all the interactions have mass dimension .6.i > 0, then the the-
ory is called super-renormalizable (for example, L = - ~ ¢D¢ + rr ¢3 describes a 
super-renormalizable theory). 

21.2 Non-renormalizable field theories 
It is worth pointing out that a theory can also be non-renormalizable due to the prop a-
tOrS generating new divergences. For example, consider the theory of a massive vector 
::son. Recall that the propagator for a massive spin-l field is 
-i(9'"v - P:f) 
iII'"v rv 
(21.20) 
p2 - m 2 + if: 
At high energy, l' » Tn thi goe as ~2 not ? Thus, each loop contribution with a 
n ive vector propagator ontribute two more factors of k 2 than the cOITesponding loop 
nIp 
,viLlI a photon. or e 'ample, adding a massive spin-I particle to the light-by-light box 
diagram (the ~ 
indicates the massive spin-l particle) 
(21.21) 
turns a superficially logarithmically divergent integral into a quadratically divergent one: 
(21.22) 
Thus, there are an infinite number of superficially divergent Feynman diagrams for a theory 
with a massive vector boson, and hence such theories are not renormalizable. That is not 
to say that they cannot be renormalized (they can!), but only that all of the UV divergences 
cannot be canceled with a finite number of counterterms. 
21.2.2 Non-renormalizable theories are renormalizable 
Although non-renormalizable theories have an infinite number of superficially divergent 
integrals, that does not mean that they give nonsense (infinities) for observables. Instead, 
non-renormalizable theories can be renormalized, but only by continually adding terms 
to the Lagrangian to provide counterterms to cancel divergences. While such a procedure 
seems like it would destroy the predictivity of a theory, in fact non-renormalizable theories 
are still extremely predictive. 
As usual, let us start with an example. Consider the Lagrangian 
£ = -~¢(D + m2 )¢+ :!¢20¢2, 
(21.23) 
where 9 has mass dimension -2. A I-loop amplitude involving this vertex could generate 
a contribution to the 4-point amplitude:

where p rerer generi ally to ollle external m mentum and c; ar number. (The eXa 
expression will have many term with many different momenta involved.) If we had onl

the tree-level c ntributi n gp2 has th same m mentum dependence as the C2 A 2p2 divcr~ 
gence. To remove the other divergences, we have to add more terms. So let us enlarge oUr 
Lagrangian to 
.c = - ~</J(O + m2)</J + ARZ>.</J4 + 9RZg</J20</J2 + liRZ",</J20 2</J2 + ... , 
2 
(21.25) 
expanding Z>. = 1 + 6>., Zg = 1 + 6g and Z'" = 1 + 6"" the counterterm contribution to 
the 4-point function is 
(21.26) 
Thus, we can choose 
AR6>. = -9hcIA4, 
6g9R = -9hc2A2, 
6",liR = -9hc31nA, 
(21.27) 
and all the infinities in Eq. (21.24) will cancel. 
Of course, there will now be new infinities from loops involving AR and liR, but as long 
as we add every possible term consistent with the symmetries of the theory, we will always 
be able to remove all of the infinities at any given order. This will be possible as long 
as the divergences multiply functions that are polynomials in external momenta, such as 
could come from counterterms in a local Lagrangian. Now we will show that this always 
happens. 
In the region of loop momentum for which k » p for all external momenta p, the 
divergent integrals can always be written as sums of terms of the form 
(PI 
m) 
J 
dk 
I div = 
~ ... Pv 91 ' " 9n 
kj 
(21.28) 
for some number m of the various external momenta p~. These integrals can produce 
logarithms of the regularization scale A, or powers of A: 
m,n 
where the sum is over all possible products of 9i and external momenta. It is very imp0l1ant 
that there can never be terms such as In p2 coming from the divergent part of the integral; 
that is, nothing like A 2 In p2 can appear. This is simply because integrands do not have any 
In p2 terms to begin with and we can go to the divergent region of the integral by taking 
k » p before integrating over anything that might give a logarithm. 
More generally: 
Divergences coming from loop iJltegrals will always multiply polynomials in the 
external momenta. 

21.2 Non-renormalizable field theories 
391 
~------------------------------------------------------- ~----~-
A simple proof due to Weinberg of this important result is as follows [Weinberg, 1995]. A 
general divergent integral will have various momenta factors in it, such as 
1
00 kdk 
I(p) = 
-
. 
o k+p 
(21.30) 
Let us assume there is at least one denominator with a factor of p (if not, the loop trivially 
giveS a polynomial in external momenta). If we differentiate the integral with respect to p 
enough times, the integral becomes convergent. For example, 
I" (p) = roo 2 k dk = ~. 
Jo 
(k+p)3 
p 
(21.31) 
Then we can then integrate over p to produce a polynomial, up to constants of integration 
we can call A and c1A: 
I(p) = pln* - p + c1A = plnp - p(lnA + 1) + clA. 
(21.32) 
The constants of integration are in one-to-one correspondence with the divergences coming 
from any regulator. Moreover, multiple integrals of an integration constant over momenta 
can only ever produce a polynomial in momenta. Thus, the non-analytic terms must 
be independent of the integration constants or, equivalently, of the divergences (and the 
regulator). This proves the theorem. 
Now, polynomials in external momenta are exactly what we get at tree-level from terms 
in the Lagrangian. So we can always introduce counterterms to cancel these divergences, 
as in the scalar field example above. In this way, all S-matrix elements can be made UV 
finite. In order to have a counterterm, we need the corresponding term to actually be in our 
Lagrangian. So the easiest thing to do is just to add every possible term with any number of 
derivatives acting on any fields. Symmetries often make certain terms unnecessary, but by 
adding all the possible terms we guarantee that counterterms can be chosen so that every 
S-matrix element will be finite. 
21.2.3 Non-renormalizable theories are predictive 
As we have seen, non-renormalizable theories require the addition of an infinite number of 
terms in the Lagrangian to guarantee that all infinities can be removed with counterterms. 
Despite the infinite number of free parameters, these theories are still very predictive. We 
will give a number of examples in the next chapter. Here we sketch a simple argument of 
why this is true. 
The first observation is that, at tree-level, terms with more derivatives have weaker 
effects at low energy (long distances). For example, consider a theory with Lagrangian 
.c = -~4>(0 + m 2 )4> + )..4>4 + ;;24>204>2 + :;44>2024>2 + ... , 
(21.33) 
Where M is some scale added to make all the coupling constants dimensionless and the 
. '. represent operators with more derivatives or more fields (which have to be added to 
gUarantee that the infinities can be canceled). Now consider some observable, such as the 
4'point function (4)4), as a function of some energy scale E. To the extent that the energy

couplings in the Lagrangian to the terms in it expansion around E = 0: (rfo4) :::::0 A.r;ed

long a we arc only interested in phy ics at low energy, Ollly-!-

few mea urements and then predict th complete 111 mentum dependence. In thi way, to a 
n tl-renormalizable theOlY i predictive even at Lree-Ievel. 
e 
A remarkable and important fact is that non-renormalizable theories are predictive 
not just at tree-level but also at loop-level, through calculable quantum corrections. The 
key to the predictivity of non-renormalizable theories is the result we proved in Sec_ 
tion 21.2.2: UV divergences are always proportional to polynomials in momenta. Thus 
the infinite number of terms required to renormalize a non-renormalizable theory are al; 
polynomial in derivatives. Such terms lead to local, short-distance effects. In contrast, the 
non-divergent part of the loops in a non-renormalizable theory may have non-analytic 
momentum dependence, which can lead to long-distance interactions. 
To see in what way analytic functions of momenta correspond to local effects, Con_ 
sider the effective potential, V (r). By the Born approximation, V (r) is given by the 
Fourier transform of the 2-point function (see Section 13.4). Thus, a term ~2 ¢02¢ might 
contribute to this potential in perturbation theory as 
M(p2) 
= ----0-
= 
(21.34) 
Since the Fourier transform of a constant is 8(r), this term gives V(r) rv ~8(r), which is 
short -ranged. This should be reminiscent of the Uehling potential calculation in Chapter 16. 
The 8 (r) term in the potential is totally irrelevant at large distances. More insertions of this 
¢02¢ operator, or contributions from other non-renormalizable operators, will give more 
positive powers of momentum. We can Fourier transform these contributions by noting that 
(~~ J J 
(~:~3e-iP'X = (~~ J 
8
3 (£). 
(21.35) 
Thus, the tree-level contribution of any of the new terms we must add can have 
only short-ranged effects. In this sense, the terms we introduce in the Lagrangian for 
non-renormalizable theories are local. 
In contrast, loops can give corrections that are non-analytic in momenta. For example, a 
loop may give In p2. The Fourier transform is then 
(21.36) 
which completely dominates over the terms coming from polynomials in momentum. This 
dominance is beautifully exhibited in quantum gravity, discussed in the next chapter, where 
quantum corrections to Newton's potential completely dominate over corrections frow 
higher-curvature terms in the Lagrangian for general relativity.

Renormalizable theories are simple and beautiful: with just a handful of measurements a 
, n 
infinite number of predictions can be made. These theories are surpassed in their mathemat_ 
ical beauty only by finite theories (which are free of UV divergences) such as string thear 
or certain supersymmetric gauge theories. For example, one particular renormalizable th; 
ory, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interactions, has been 
remarkably successful phenomenologically. Since the 1970s, dozens of next-to-Ieading 
order calculations have been performed. A handful of observables have even been Com_ 
puted at next-to-next-to-Ieading order, involving 2-100p Feynman diagrams. The effective 
coupling constant in QCD is known in 4-100ps. 
Despite these amazing successes, it may seem somewhat surprising that, after decades 
of effort, only a handful of QCD observables have been computed beyond I-loop. There 
are even fewer measurements that are sensitive to the precision of these theoretical 
calculations. In some sense, the merit of renormalizability also limits its usefulness: 
to predict an infinite number of observables in perturbation theory with a finite num-
ber of parameters one must actually evaluate the loops! These loops provide a devilish 
mathematical challenge. Although it has been known for many years that all I-loop 
amplitudes could be reduced in terms of a set of master integrals [Passarino and Velt-
man, 1979], actually performing the reduction and evaluating the integrals remains 
extremely challenging. Difficulties include the factorial growth of terms in the ampli-
tude when computed with Feynman diagrams (see Chapter 27) and IR divergences 
which make the numerical evaluation of the loops infeasible. At 2-100ps, a com-
plete set of master integrals for the reduction is still not known. In addition, only for 
carefully chosen observables in certain theories is the perturbation series even conver-
gent. In many cases, convergence is destroyed by large logarithms (see Chapters 23 
and 36), or worse, because the expansion in coupling constants leads to a non-convergent 
senes. 
Luckily, however, not all of quantum field theory consists of computing loops in renor-
malizable theories. If one's goal is to make predictions that can be compared to experiment, 
it is often better to use a non-renormalizable theory rather than a renormalizable one. By 
isolating the relevant degrees of freedom for a physical problem, one can construct an 
appropriate effective theory which has a limited range of applicability, but is much more 
predictive in that range than the corresponding renormalizable theory on which it is based. 
These effective theories are generally non-renormalizable, but they are still predictive at 
the quantum level. 
In this chapter, we will look at examples from particle physics of predictive non-
renormalizable theories. We will discuss four examples corresponding to the four forces of

thiS material either in piralional or incomprehen ible. The hope i lbat, by applying Olll' 
current understanding of renormalization in various contexts, the need for more powerful 
techniques will become apparent. 
22.1 The Schrodinger equation 
Consider the Schrodinger equation with some external potential V( 7'): 
(22.1) 
This is a non-renormalizable, non-relativistic effective field theory. The parameter with 
negative mass dimension is simply ~. Thus, we should add all terms consistent with 
symmetries. Hence we should write a general Hamiltonian: 
(22.2) 
where the ai are numbers and the factors of m are added by dimensional analysis. As you 
may recall from Problem 10.1, we found a Hamiltonian of precisely this form from taking 
the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, with al 
-
~. More simply, we could 
expand the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian to get

H = j-j!2 + m 2 - m = ~ 
- L + _P- + .. . 
2m 
8m3 
16m5 
(22.3) 
so that al = -~, a2 = i, etc. 
As you well know from quantum mechanics, the Schrodinger equation is useful even 
if we do not know about Lorentz invariance or that al = 
-
~. The reason is that in 
the non-relativistic limit IPl « m, the higher-order terms generally have a very small 
effect. Nevertheless, through specially designed experiments, these coefficients can in fact 
be measured. For example, al contributes to the fine structure of the hydrogen atom, and 
Q2 contributes to the hyperfine structure. So even if al and a2 were not known from the 
Dirac equation, they could be measured from the hydrogen atom. Once measured, they 
Could then be used to make predictions: the fine structure of helium, for example, or lots 
of other things. 
395 

396 
Non-renormalizable theories 
Thus, the Schrodinger equation, and its generalization in Eq. (22.2), describe a very Pr 
dictive quantum theory. This theory is predictive despite it being non-renormalizable a e_ 
having an infinite number of terms - the Schrodinger equation made quantum predictio~d 
many years before the Dirac equation was discovered. 
S 
It is also important to note that the Schrodinger equation is not predictive for moment 
1P1 ;2: m, since all of the higher-order terms are then important. Thus, the SchrOdinge~ 
equation is predictive at low energy, but also indicates the scale at which perturbation 
theory breaks down. If we can find a theory that reduces to the Schrodinger equation at 
low energy, but for which perturbation theory still works at high energy, it is called a DV 
completion of the Schrodinger equation. Thus, the Dirac equation is a UV completion of 
the Schrodinger equation. The Dirac equation (and QED) are predictive to much higher 
energies (but not at all energies, because of the Landau pole). The Klein-Gordon equation 
is a different UV completion of the Schrodinger equation. 
22.2 The 4-Fermi theory 
Weak decays were first modeled by Enrico Fermi in 1933. He observed that the easiest way 
to model ,B-decay, in which a proton decays into a neutron, positron and neutrino, is with 
an interaction of the form 
(22.4) 
with maybe some ,),-matrices thrown in between the spinors. This is known as a 
4-Fermi interaction, both because there are four fermions in it and because Fermi used 
it as a very successful model of radioactive decay. Similar 4-Fermi operators, such as 
GF -0/L'l/Jvl-' -0e'l/Jve , also model the decay of the muon, p,- ~ e- vevw The Fermi constant 
is in fact best measured from the decay rate of the muon with the result 
(22.5) 
Since this was extracted from an actual experiment, it con-esponds to the renormalized 
value of the coupling. It is not obvious that G F in the muon 4-Fermi operator should be 
the same G F in the nuclear ,B-decay operator; that they are the same implies a deeper 
structure and a symmetry governing these decays, now understood through the theory of 
weak interactions. 
Since GF has mass dimension -2, LPermi is a non-renormalizable interaction. Thus, 
there will be an infinite number of divergent one-particle irreducible graphs and an infinite 
number of counterterms are needed to cancel them. To prepare 1\ r lhi , we mu t add to 
LFermi all terms consistent with its symmetries (whatever those might be). For example, we 
may have terms such as

by comparing the predictions of'l/J'ljJ'l/J'lp to those of 'l/J1'51'''''l/J'l/J1'51'''''l/J. All of these predic-
tions are for low-energy measurements and therefore almost totally independent of the ai 
(assuming the ai are not enormously large). 
Besides tree-level predictions, one can also calculate loops in this non-renormalizable 
theory and derive physically testable predictions from those loops. For simplicity, let us 
imagine that all the fermions in Eq. (22.6) are identical. Then there will be both tree-level 
and loop contributions to the process 'l/J'l/J -+ 'l/J'l/J. At tree-level, the Lagrangian generates 
S-matrix elements of the form 
(22.7) 
where s does not necessarily represent s = 
(PI + P2)2 but any kinematical Lorentz-
invariant quantity of mass dimension 2, and we are ignoring the external spinors for 
simplicity. At low energies, s « GJ/, this scattering is dominated by the leading term, 
with subleading terms suppressed by powers of sG p « 1. At I-loop, there is a contribution 
of the form 
On the right, we have parametrized the possible forms the result could take with three finite 
and calculable constants bo, bl , and b2 and a regulator scale A. Without any symmetry 
arguments, there is no reason to expect that any of the constants bi should vanish. Thus, 
M tree + M loop rv (G p + boA2G~) + sG~(al + b1 + b2 1nA2)

(22.9) 
where we have grouped terms by their momentum dependence. The key term in this expres-
sion is the b2s In s term, whlch has no analog coming from the classical Lagrangian, Eg. 
(22.6). 
To make physical predictions, we have to renormalize. To do so, we introduce counter-
terms in the usual way. Equation (22.6) is treated as a bare Lagrangian and Z-factors are 
introduced: 
(22.10)

398 
Non-renormalizable theories 
Then, we write ZF = 1 + fJF, Zl = 1 + fJ1, etc. (these are different Zi from the QED 
renormalization factors with the same name). Then we find

and we can choose 8F = -boA2GF and 81 = - a\ (h + b2 ln ~:), with So an arbitrary 
scale, to remove the infinities and reduce the leading two terms to the form of Eq. (22.7) 
where now G F and ai are the renormalized coefficients of these terms. This renormaliza~ 
tion removes almost the entire result of the loop; however, one term remains. We find the 
renormalized matrix element is 
M(s) = Mloop+Mtree+Mc.L rv GF+SG}( al - b2ln :0) +a2s2G}+··· . (22.12) 
At the scale s = So this is identical to the tree-level prediction. If the s dependence of the 
distribution at low energies is well-enough measured, GF, aI, b2, a2, etc. can be extracted 
from data. Although the constants ai are not calculable, the constant b2 is. More preCisely, 
one could plot 
M(S I) - GF 
M(S2) - GF

(22.13) 
and see whether the logarithmic scale dependence agrees with the theoretical calculation. 
Thus, b2 is a genuine testable prediction from a loop calculation in a non-renormalizable 
theory. 
The reason this works is because the In s dependence can never come from a tree-level 
calculation. This is because tree-level calculations come from local Lagrangians that have 
only integer powers of derivatives, never terms such as ,¢'l/J,¢ In D'l/J. This is a general 
result: 
Non-analytic energy dependence is a testable quantum prediction of non-renormalizable 
(or renormalizable) theories. 
We will see phenomenologically relevant examples of these logarithmic corrections to 
the real 4-Fermi theory in Chapter 23 (on the renormalization group) and in Chapter 31 (on 
precision tests of the Standard Model). 
22.2.1 UV completing the Fermi theory 
Although the 4-Fermi theory is very predictive, its predictive power is confined to the low-
energy regime. As energies approach G-;.1/2 rv 300 GeV, each tenll in Eq. (22.7) becomes 
important and perturbation theory breaks down. Thus, the 4-Fermi theory calls out for a 
UV completion. 
A UV completion of the 4-Fermi theory is a theory with massive vector bosons, the 
W± bosons (which are charged) and the Z boson (which is neutral). This UV completion 
actually combines the weak interactions with QED to form the electroweak theory, which

9w = 0.65, as discussed in Chapter 29.) Taylor expanding tne propagator in Eq. (22.15) to 
higher orders in ~2 gives predictions for the higher-order terms in the non-renormalizable 
Lagrangian in Eq. (22.6). For example, the next term would be M rv g2 Atrih ,I"UI U2,I"V2, 
which would conespond to a term ~1jj,I"'ljJ-fh1jj,I"'ljJ. This exactly parallels how the

The actual electroweak theory involves four gauge bosons conesponding to the genera-
tors of a non-Abelian gauge group SU(2) x U(l). We will study these non-Abelian gauge 
theories in great detail in Part IV, but for now, we only need one important fact: the p;:; 
terms in the numerator of the gauge boson propagator are no longer guaranteed to drop 
out. Thus, as discussed in the previous chapter, propagators can scale as ~

and 28 respectively. 
The main points of this section are 
• Non-renormalizable theories are predictive at low energy, despite the infinite number of 
terms in their Lagrangians. 
• Non-analytic momentum dependence in observables is a testable prediction of loop 
calculations. 
• The dimensionful coupling indicates a breakdown of perturbation theory at the scale of 
the coupling. 
• Dependence on powers of external momenta can be fit to data and give hints about the 
UV completion. 
In these two examples, corresponding to the electromagnetic and weak forces, we Were 
lucky enough to have UV completions from which the low-energy non-renormalizable 
theory could be calculated in perturbation theory. In the next two examples, corresponding 
to the strong and gravitational forces, this will not be true. 
22.3 Theory of mesons 
The first field-theoretic model of nuclear structure was conceived by Hideki Yukawa in 
1935. He noted that nuclear interactions seem to be confined within the nucleus, and there-
fore are of very short range. Keep in mind, he was trying to explain why neutrons and 
protons stick together, not anything to do with the substructure of the neutron or proton 
themselves. The confusion in the 1930s was whether what was binding the neutrons and 
protons had anything to do with what caused radioactive decay (the weak force). Yukawa 
was the first person to speculate that they were different. Actually, the more profound 
and lasting insight that he made was the connection between forces and virtual particle 
exchange. In 1935 people were still using old-fashioned perturbation theory, and nobody 
thought of virtual particles as actually existing. 
We already know that the exchange of a massive particle in the non-relativistic limit 
leads not to a Coulomb potential but to a Yukawa potential, VCr) = - 4!re-mr. Yukawa 
saw that m rv 100 Me V was the appropriate scale for nuclear interactions, and there-
fore postulated that there should be particles of mass intermediate between the nucleons 
('" 1 Ge V) and the electrons (rv 1 MeV), and he called them mesons. The mesons respon-
sible for the nuclear interactions are called pions, which we now know are bosonic 
quark-antiquark bound states. 
Incidentally, the first meson was discovered in 1936 by Carl Anderson in cosmic rays, 
four years after he discovered the positron. Anderson's meson had a mass of 100 Me V, very

pion exchange provides a powerful effective description of strong short-range nuclear 
forces. You probably already know that QCD is the actual theory of the strong nuclear 
force. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to use QCD to study nuclear physics. Even the 
simple explanation of why the strong force is short-ranged had to wait until asymptotic 
freedom was understood in the 1970s, 40 years after Yukawa's phenomenological explana-
tion. From the 1940s through the 1980s theorists were using a variety of methods, most 
notably current algebra, to make phenomenological predictions about strong interac-
tions. Today, current algebra has been superseded by effective field theory techniques that 
combine the insights of current algebra with quantum field theory. The result is a pow-
erfullow-energy non-renormalizable theory of nuclear interactions known as the Chiral 
Lagrangian. 
The Chiral Lagrangian is based on the observation that nuclear forces are invariant under 
an SU(2) symmetry called isospin, under which the proton and neutron transform as a 
doublet, 'l/Ji = (p+, n). Though the electromagnetic force can distinguish these two states, 
to the strong force, they are identical. Thus the pions, which mediate the strong interactions 
between neutrons and protons, should respect the SU(2) symmetry. There are three pions, 
the 7f+, 7f- and 7fo, where the superscript refers to electric charge. The Chiral Lagrangian 
combines them into a single matrix using the Pauli matrices aa for SU(2) as 
(22.17) 
where 7fo = 7f3 and 7f± = ~ 
(7fl ± i7f2). Here, F7r is a constant with dimensions of 
mass, so that U is dimensionless, and is called the pion decay constant. As we will see in 
Chapter 28, F1f can be extracted from the pion decay rate with the result F7r = 92 MeV. 
You are not expected to understand at this point why the pions should be representable 
this way - the reason is that they are Goldstone bosons for a spontaneously broken chi-
ral SU(2h x SU(2)R symmetry acting on left- and right-handed quarks in the QCD 
Lagrangian, as we explain in great detail in Chapter 28 - our goal here is only to see how the 
symmetry allows us to make systematic quantum predictions in the quantum theory. Using 
the parametrization in Eq. (22.17), one can easily write down terms in a Lagrangian that 
respect the SU(2) symmetry. In particular, the simplest term we can write down involving 
U is 
(22.18) 
Which is known as the Chiral Lagrangian. Here Dp = 8p -
iQiAp, with Qi the pion 
electric charge, is the covariant derivative from QED. 
401 

402 
Non-renormalizable theories 
Expanding the Chiral Lagrangian out to quadratic order gives normal kinetic terms and 
photon interactions from scalar QED: 
Lkin = ~(a",7rO)(a"'7rO) + (D",7r+)(D",7r-)t. 
(22.19) 
Expanding to higher orders produces interactions such as 
Lint = ~ 
[--317r07rOa",7r+a",7r- + .. . J + ~ 
[~(7r- 7r+)2a",7rOa"'7rO + ... J + .. .. 
F'/r 
F'/r 
18 
Since F" has dimensions of mass, the Chiral Lagrangian is non-renormalizable. The ~~~~~~ 
tant point is that the interactions in the Chiral Lagrangian have a special form since the 
are constrained by the SU(2) symmetry. In particular, each term has two derivatives, so f~ 
example, a term such as f:; 7rg is forbidden. The coefficient of each term is also completely 
fixed. 
Since this theory is non-renormalizable, we should also add more terms to absorb infini_ 
ties from loops. Since Ut U = 1 we cannot write down any non-trivial term without 
derivatives. There are only three terms you can write down with four derivatives: 
L4 = L1tr[(D",U)(D",U)t]2 + L2tr[(D",U)(DvU)t]2 
+ L3tr [(D",U)(D",U)t(DvU)(DIIU)t]. 
(22.21) 
Thus, the Chiral Lagrangian admits a derivative expansion, with the leading term, Lx in 
Eq. (22.18), dominant and L4 being suppressed at low energies. One could add additional 
terms, which would have six or more derivatives, but these would be additionally sup-
pressed, and unmeasurable from a practical point of view. The coefficients L1, L2 and L3 
have been fit from low-energy pion scattering experiments from which it has been found 
that L1 = 0.65, L2 = 1.89 and L3 = -3.06. Additional interactions are suppressed by 
powers of momentum divided by the parameter Frr = 92 MeV. 
As with the 4-Fermi theory, the quantum effects of the Chiral Lagrangian are calculable 
and measurable as well. They take the form of non-analytic logarithmic corrections to pion 
scattering cross sections and even have a name: chiral logs (see for example [Weinberg, 
1979]). 
As with any non-renormalizable theory, the Chiral Lagrangian points to its own demise-
it becomes non-perturbative at a scale Vi '" 47r Frr ~ 1200 MeV. Above this scale, all the 
higher-order interactions become relevant and the tl1e ry i nOI predictive. A UV comple-
tion of the Chiral Lagrangian is QCD, the the ry of quark and gluon '. This i . a completely 
different type of UV completion than the eleco' weak theory which UV-completed Lhe 
4-Ferrni theory or the Dirac equation which UV-completed l11 
chrodinger equation. For 
both of these theories, the fermions in the low-energy tJ1eory were present in lhe UV com-
pletion, but with different interactions. The theory of Q D doe n l have pions in it at alii 
Thus, one cannot ask about pion scattering at high energy in QeD. [n tead one mll I try

22.4 Quantum gravity 
The final non-renormalizable field theory we will discuss in this chapter is quantum gravity. 
This is the effective descliption of a massless spin-2 particle. We have already shown two 
important results about massless spin-2 particles. In Section 8.7, we embedded the spin-2 
particles in a tensor field h~v. The only consistent way to do this had a gauge symmetry 
under local space-time translations: 
(22.22) 
also known as general coordinate transformations. The Noether current for this sym-
metry is the energy-momentum tensor T~O', which we derived in Section 3.3.1, whose 
conserved charges are energy and momentum. In Section 9.5, we bypassed the discus-
sion of gauge invariance and showed, by considering the soft limit, that Lorentz invaliance 
implies that massless spin-2 particles are associated with a conserved charge. It is, nev-
ertheless, useful to desclibe massless spin-2 particles with a local Lagrangian, so we will 
review the results of Section 8.7, and continue to discuss quantum effects in this theory. 
In Section 8.7 we showed that a massless spin-2 particle can be embedded in a tensor 
field h/J,V only if the Lagrangian for h~v is invariant under infinitesimal transformations 
parametrized by four functions ~O': 
The first two terms are the gauge part; they are the analog of A~ ---+ A~ + 8~a in QED but 
with four types of a, now called ~O'. The last three terms are just the transformation proper-
ties of a tensor representation of the Poincare group under infinitesimal general coordinate 
transformations. We also showed that the unique kinetic term for h~v was 
1 
1 
L\in = 2h~vDh~v -
h~v8~80'hva + h8~8vh~v - 2 hDh. 
(22.24) 
The leading interactions have two delivatives and three factors of h and are therefore of the 
form Lint rv Ml Dh3 for some dimensional scale lUP1 . Thus, any interacting field theory 
Pl 
of massless spin-2 particles is automatically non-renormalizable. Finally, it is possible to 
show [Feynman et ai., 1996] that the minimal set of interactions can be combined into the 
concise form

You can either review these results from the bottom-up approach of Section 8.7, derive 
them using the top-down approach of general relativity, or just take them as given. You 
do not need to know general relativity to follow the subsequent discussion of quantum 
corrections. The only thing you need to know is that there is a symmetry, general coordi_ 
nate invariance, which vastly restricts the terms one can write down in a Lagrangian for a 
massless spin-2 particle. 
22.4.1 Quantum predictions 
-
General coordinate invariance implies that the Lagrangian must be a functional of h/.Lv and 
the Riemann curvature tensor R/.Ll.Ia!3 [h/.Ll.IJ. We also write 
R/.LV = ga!3 R a/.L!3l.1 , 
R = gllV R llv 
(22.27) 
for the Ricci tensor and scalar. 
The Riemann tensor can be thought of as

Ju t like the Chiral Lagrangian, the Lagrangian for gravity is non-renormalizablc but 
strongly constrained by symmetries. The higher-order terms we must add to be able to 
renormalize this non-renormalizable theory are all products of the metric and the Riemann 
tensor:

by which the orbit of Mercury would have to be measured to see the effect of this term. 
The higher-order terms, like the ones proportional to L1 and L 2 , contribute corrections 
to Newton's potential as well. One can actually solve Einstein's equations exactly with L1 
and L 2 . For L 1 , the result is that at large distances the potential around the Sun has the

Thus, the effects of the Li terms are short-ranged, as expected from the general argument

can be written as [Donoghue, 1994]

is that the higher-order terms in the gravity Lag;~ngian are unmeasurable. 
Now let us consider loops. The simplest loop that contributes a correction to Newton's 
potential is a correction to the graviton propagator, which has the same general form as 
the vacuum polarization graph. Since the calculations are tedious, we will just summarize 
results. In harmonic gauge, 2o/-,h/-,v = ovh/-,/-" the graviton propagator is

Thus, the radiative correction (the 3~~2 MJ r2 term) is a testable prediction that is paramet-
rically more important than the Li terms.PPor the perihelion shift of Mercury, the effect is 
one part in (Mplr)2 rv 1090, which we are not going to measure any time soon. Neverthe-
less, it is a genuine prediction of quantum gravity. This prediction is entirely independent 
of the UV completion of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. 
This calculation should make it clear that: 
There is nothing inconsistent about general relativity and quantum mechanics. 
General relativity is the only consistent theory of an interacting massless spin-2 particle. 
It is a quantum theory, just as solid and calculable as the 4-Fermi theory. It is non-
renormalizable, and therefore non-perturbative for energies E 
~ M p1 , but it is not 
inconsistent. At distances r rv AjPl rv 10-33 cm (the Planck length), all of the quantum 
corrections and all of the higher-order terms in the Lagrangian become important. 
So, if we want to use gravity at very short distances we need a UV completion. String 
theory is one such theory. It is capable of calculating the Li terms in Eq. (22.29). If we 
could measure the L i , then we could test string theory. However, as noted above, these Li 
terms have exponentially suppressed effects at distances greater than the Planck length. In 
fact, we can now understand why it is so difficult to test string theory: long-distance physicS 
is determined by symmetries in an effective quantum theory that is independent of the UV 
completion. The quantum prediction, the 3~~2 MiL T3 correction to Newton's potential, is

22.5 Summary of non-renormalizable theories 
We have looked at four important non-renormalizable theories: 
• The Schrodinger equation is perturbative for E < me. Its UV completion is the Dirac 
equation and QED, which is perturbative up to its Landau pole, E '" 10286 GeY. 
• The Fermi theory of weak interactions is perturbative for E < C-;.1/2 '" 300 GeV. 
Its UV completion is the electroweak theory with massive vector bosons Wand Z. 
The electroweak theory is also non-renormalizable. Its UV completion contains a Higgs 
boson. 
• The Chiral Lagrangian is the low-energy theory of pions. It is perturbative and very 
predictive for E < 47T'F7r '" 1200 MeY. Its UV completion is QCD. QCD is predictive 
at high energies. The fields in QCD, quarks and gluons, are related to pions and other 
hadrons (quark and gluon bound states) in a complicated, non-perturbative way. Thus, 
to study hadrons in QCD, we need non-perturbative methods, such as the lattice. In 
contrast, at low energy the Chiral Lagrangian is perturbative and therefore more useful 
than QCD for answering certain questions. 
• General relativity is the low-energy theory of gravity. It is perturbative for E < Mpl '" 
1019 GeY. It is extremely predictive at low energies, including predictive quantum cor-
rections. One possible UV completion is string theory. Gravitational physics at distances 
larger than the Planck length, 10- 33 cm, is independent of the UV completion, which 
explains why string theory (as a quantum theory of gravity) is so hard to test. 
These four examples correspond to the four forces of nature: the electromagnetic force, 
the weak force, the strong force, and gravity. Notice that the UV completions are all 
qualitatively very different. In some cases, certainly for many physical applications, the 
non-renormalizable theory is more useful than the renormalizable one. Renormalizable just 
means there are a finite number of counterterms; it does not mean that you can calculate 
every observable perturbatively. 
22.6 Mass terms and naturalness 
Baving discussed non-renormalizable interactions, which correspond to terms in a 
Lagrangian whose coefficients have negative mass dimension, we tum to terms whose 
coefficients have positive mass dimension. We begin with a discussion of renormalization 
of masses, with other possibilities discussed in Section 22.7.

22.6.1 Scalar masses

Let us begin the discussion of scalar masses with an explicit calculation. This will lead t 
a discussion of fine-tuning and naturalness. Consider the Lagrangian 
0 
(22.41) 
which describes a scalar of mass m coupled to a Dirac fermion of mass 111. We wil! 
investigate the effect of the fermion loop on the scalar mass.

The trace is Tt[(p + ~ + M)(~ + M)] = 4(k2 + k· p + M 2). Combining denominators, 
shifting kll ~ kll - pll (1 -x) and dropping terms in the numerator linear in kll gives

otlnterterms, which in any case are regulator dependent. 
C The divergences proportional to p2 and lvI2 are canceled with counterterms from the 
field strength and mass renormalizations of the scalar: 
(22.47) 
vsing on-shell renormalization, we set the pole of the propagator at the renormalized mass, 
with residue 1. As discussed in Section 18.3, after summing the geometric series of one-
particle irreducible contributions to the scalar propagator, the result is 
(22.48) 
with ~(p2) = ~2(p2)+p26¢-(6m + 6¢) m~. Theon-shell conditions are then ~(m~) = 
~/(m~) = 0 at the pole mass mp = mR, which imply

This is a perfectly finite result. 
In many calculations it is more efficient to use minimal subtraction than the on-shell 
scheme. In particular, indirect evidence for the mass of the Higgs boson came from pre-
cision measurements of the Wand Z masses and other electroweak parameters. As will 
be shown in Chapter 31, these get finite radiative corrections from loops involving quarks, 
most notably the top quark, and the Higgs. The on-shell pole mass for the top quark is 
mt rv 173.5 GeV while its MS mass is mt rv 165.6 [Particle Data Group (Beringer et al.), 
2012]. This 5% difference comes from loops involving gluons. For these calculations one 
should also use the MS mass for the Higgs bosons, which differs from the experimentally 
measured pole mass due primarily to the loop we just calculated involving the top quark.

This is an intriguing result. Although the difference is finite, as fill --+ 00 the difference 
grows very large. Indeed, the difference is sensitive to particles much heavier than the mass 
of the scalar. Although the result is finite, heavy particles are not decoupling. In this Way, 
the scalar mass is UV sensitive. Other, somewhat more philosophical, manifestations of 
the UV sensitivity are discussed below. 
To make this discussion more concrete, consider the sensitivity of the Higgs boson mass 
to the mass of the top quark. In this case, M = mt = 163 GeV is the top quark MS mass, 
A = At = 0.93 is the top-quark Yukawa coupling, and the Higgs boson pole mass is 
mp = 125 GeY. Then, Eq. (22.53) gives 
(22.54) 
so that m MS = 123.6 GeY. Thus, while there could have been a large difference, the dif-
ference turns out to be numerically less than 1 %. In contrast, suppose the Higgs pole mass 
were mp = 30 GeV, then the top loop would lead to m MS = 72 GeV, a correction of 140%. 
22.6.2 Fine-tuning 
We saw that although the scalar mass gets quadratically divergent corrections, for example 
from a fermion loop, these divergences can be removed with counterterms. The resulting 
physical pole mass must be determined from experiment as a renormalization condition. 
It does not get corrections at any order in perturbation theory, since by definition it is the 
physical value of the mass. However, we saw that there can be a large difference between 
the pole mass and the MS mass for a scalar. In particular, the difference in the squares of 
these masses is proportional to the square of the mass of any fermion that couples to the 
scalar. Since heavy fermions do not decouple, the scalar mass is UV sensitive. 
If we allow our elve to speculate about short-distance physics for which the Lagrangian' 
in Eq. (22.41) j the low-energy description, the UV sensitivity of the calar ma 
can lead 
to unc mt' rtable interpretalion ' . Suppose the theory were finite, for example if it were UV 
completed into string theory, or more simply if it were Lhe effective de cri.ption of omc 
condensed matter system (in which case A might repre ent 
me parameter of the micro-
scopic description, such as an inverse atomi 
pa ing). Then the bar rna 
m and cutoff A 
would be physical. In this situation, the pole mass would be given by m~ = m 2 + (mZ) 
plus higher-order terms, and we could take the A2 divergence in Eq. (22.46) literally. ThuS, 
to have a scalar whose mass m~ « A2 requires that the bare mass parameter m 2 in the 
Lagrangian must be m 2 ;:::;j A 2 + m~. For example, if the scalar were the Higgs whose pole 
mass is mp ;:::;j 125 GeV, and A were of order the Planck scale, A rv M p 1 rv 1019 GeV, we

'n Chtlpter 23. provid~ another way to think about fine-tuning and UV 
nsitivilY. 
J Much of Our intuition for fine-tuning and llaluralne .. comes fTom onden ed matter 
hysics. Consider, for example, some system that undergoes an order-disorder phase tran-
~ition. To be concrete, consider the loss of magnetization when a fen-omagnet is heated 
above its Curie temperature, Te . Such a transition can be parametrized with an order 
parameter cp( x), representing the magnitude of the magnetization in the ferromagnet. Lan-
dau showed that one could reproduce some of the phenomenology of phase transitions with 
an effective Lagrangian for cp. The Ginzburg- Landau approach models the phase transition 
with a Lagrangian valid for temperatures T near the critical temperature Te as 
(22.55) 
with a a number and b(T) some function that we are not concerned about here. The lin-
earity in temperature of the quadratic term gives cp a positive mass-squared above Te and 
a negative mass-squared below Te. The negative mass-squared indicates an instability, 
which we will discuss in more detail in the context of spontaneous symmetry break-
ing in Chapter 28. The point here is that the effective mass for the scalar is given by 
m2 = 2a(T - Te). Physically, the mass determines the coherence length ~ rv m - 1 of 
the system (as in the Yukawa potential V(r) = 4;re-mr = - 4;re- r/E). At high tempera-
tures, the spins in a fen-omagnet are thermally excited and uncon-elated beyond the atomic 
spacing A -1, so m rv A. At low temperatures, the spins are aligned and disorder has cor-
relations also of order A -1. Near the critical temperature, it is possible that m « A and 
there can be long-range correlations. In particular, to get a mass m 2 = 1O- 34A2 we have 
to fine-tune the temperature of the system by hand so that T is within Te to one part in 
10-34. Other things besides temperature can be tuned too; for example, interesting emer-
gent behavior may be seen in materials that have their chemical composition fine-tuned by 
a very specific amount of doping. 
In pmticle physics, one has no external dial to tune or chemical composition to vary. In a 
finite theory, one might imagine calculating all the UV couplings and parameters from first 
principles, and seeing that some differ by a part in 1034 to give a light Higgs pole mass. 
However, to actually calculate this mass from first principles, one would need not just 
the I-loop con-ection, but the entire non-pe1turbative dependence on the UV parameters. 
Moreover, one can still renormalize field strengths and Lagrangian parameters in a finite 
theory, so the prediction must be independent of such redefinitions. 
In a renormalizable theory, one can only measure the finite number of renormalized 
parameters. The scalar mass is one of them, thus its value does not depend on anything - it 
is an experimentally measured quantity. In a renormalizable theory, such as the Standard 
Model or the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, the fine-tuning manifests as a sen-
sitivity to changing parameters in the model. The fine-tuning in this case takes place in the

are no testable predictions of the anthropic principle. 
22.6.3 Fermion and gauge boson masses 
-
Other coefficients of positive mass dimension are fermion and gauge boson masses. Con-
sider first radiative conections to fermion masses. For example, we already calculated the 
self-energy graph of the electron in QED in Chapter 18. With dimensional regularization, 
the result was (Eq. (18.50»

which can be compared to Eq. (22.46). The difference between the pole and MS mass for 
the electron in QED was also calculated in Chapter 18, in Eq. (18.65): 
mp - mMS = 1~:2 m p ( 5 + 3ln ~~) , 
(22.57) 
which can be compared to Eq. (22.54). 
Although not apparent in the expansion around d = 4, the full result has no pole in 
d = 2 or d = 3 and is therefore not quadratically or linearly divergent. That is a non-trivial 
fact. In non-relativistic quantum mcchani • you do get a linearly illvergent shift. This can 
be seen from a simple integral over the cia ical electron . eU·-energy. 1 n the non-relativistic 
limit, the energy density of the electromagnetic field is p

t.m ~ I d3r p(r) ~ I d3r (:2 f ~ et 1~1 r:~r ~ etA.

There is no correction proportional to the scalar mass m, only to the fermion mass M. This 
graph is also not linearly divergent. 
What if we throw in some more fermions or a couple more scalars, or look at 6-100ps? 
It turns out that the mass shift will always be proportional to the fermion mass. The reason 
this happens is because the electron mass is protected by a custodial chiral symmetry. 
A chiral symmetry is a global symmetry under which the left- and right-handed electron 
have opposite charge: 'l/JL ---7 e-ia'I/JL and 'l/JR ---7 eia'I/JR. We can write the transformation 
concisely as 
Under this transformation, the kinetic term and QED interaction are invariant, 
7/;I/J'I/J ---7 'I/J t e-iC<iLYoI/Jeiai5'I/J = 7/;I/J'I/J, 
since I~ = 15 and [,5, IOllll = O. However, the mass term is not: 
me7/;'I/J ---7 me7/;e2iai5'I/J -=I- me7/;'I/J. 
(22.60) 
(22.61) 
(22.62) 
Thus, the mass term breaks the chiral symmetry. This is consistent with the expansion in 
terms ofWeyl fermions: 
(22.63) 
which shows that only the mass term couples fields with different charges under the chiral 
symmetry. 
The chiral symmetry is exact in the limit me ---7 O. That means that if me = 0 then, 
because of the exact symmetry, me will stay 0 to all orders in perturbation theory. For me -=I-
0, if we treat the mass as an interaction rather than a kinetic term, then every diagram that 
Violates the chiral symmetry, including a correction to the mass itself, must be proportional 
to me. We call the symmetry custodial because it acts like a custodian and protects the 
illass from large corrections, even if the symmetry is not exact. We also say sometimes that 
setting me = 0 is technically natural ['t Hooft, 1979] (See Box 22.1). 
413 

414 
Non-renormalizable theories 
It IS technically natural for a parameter to be small If quantum corrections t 
the parameter are proportional to the parameter itself. This happens if th~ 
theory has an enhanced symmetry when the parameter is zero. 
For another example, consider a vector boson mass. A photon mass term 
L = ... +m2 A2 
, 
I" 
(22.64) 
breaks gauge invariance. In the limit m, = 0, gauge invariance is exact, and thus gauge 
invariance is a custodial symmetry. Thus, any contribution to the photon mass will be 
proportional to m,. For m, = 0, the photon will not get any corrections to any order in 
perturbation theory. Keep in mind that this only works if the only term that breaks gauge 
invariance is the mass term. If there are other interactions breaking gauge invariance, the 
mass correction can be proportional to them as well. For example, in the theory of weak 
interactions, the Wand Z bosons have masses that get corrections proportional not only 
to mw and mz respectively, but also to fermion masses, since these masses are forbidden 
by the SU(2)weak gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the Standard MOdel 
(see Chapter 29). 
An important example of a custodial symmetry not related to anything being massless is 
custodial isospin, which will be defined in Section 31.2. 
22.7 Super-renormalizable theories 
In four dimensions there are not many options for Lagrangian terms with coefficients of 
positive mass dimension. The possibilities are mass terms, which we already discussed, 
a constant term, terms linear in fields, such as A 3 ¢, and cubic couplings among bosons, 
such as g¢3 or g¢A~. That exhausts the possibilities in four dimensions. We have already 
discussed masses, so now we will quickly go through the other possibilities. 
22.7.1 Cosmological constant and tadpoles 
The only possible term of mass dimension 4 is a constant: 
L= "'+p. 
(22.65) 
This constant p has a name: the cosmological constant. By itself, this term does nothing. 
It couples to nothing and in fact it can just be pulled out of the path integral. The reason it 
is dangerous is because when one couples to gravity and expands gI"l/ = 'TIl"l/ + IviPl hl"v, 
the Lagrangian becomes

briefly in Section 18.1 and will be studied in detail in the context of spontaneous symmetry

One can consider the short-distance limit of ¢3 theory in perturbation theory. Unfortu_ 
nately, this theory is sick in the same way a theory with a linear tadpole term is sick, since 
the potential is unbounded from below. If one adds a quartic term to the potential to make 
it bounded, then the quartic interaction will dominate over the cubic one at short distances. 
Thus, it is not clear how to make any self-consistent theoretical predictions in ¢3 theory.

The renormalization group is one of those brilliant ideas that lets you get something for 
nothing through clever reorganization of things you already know. It is hard to under-
estimate the importance of the renormalization group in shaping the way we think about 
quantum field theory. The phrase renormalization group refers to an invariance of 
observables under changes in the way things are calculated. There are two versions of 
the renormalization group used in quantum field theory, the Wilsonian renormaliza-
don group and the continuum renormalization group. They are defined in Boxes 23.1 
and 23.2. 
In a finite theory with a UV cutoff A, physics at energies E « A is inde-
pendent of the precise value of A. Changing A changes the couplings in the 
theory so that observables remain the same. 
The continuum renormaHzation group 
Observables are independent of the renormalization conditions, in particular, 
of the scales {Po} at which we choose to define our renormalized quanti-
ties. This invariance holds after the theory is renormalized and the cutoff is 
removed (A = 00, d = 4). In dimensional regularization with MS, the scales 
{Po} are replaced by 1-", and the continuum renormalization group comes 
from I-" independence. 
The two versions are closely related, but technically different. Much confusion arises 
from confiating them, for example trying to take A all the way down to physical low-
energy scales in the Wilsonian case or taking f.t --) 00 in the continuum case. Although 
the renormalization group equations have essentially the same form in the two versions, 
the two methods really are conceptually different and we will try to keep them separate 
as much as possible, concentrating on the continuum method, which is more practical for 
actual quantum field theory calculations. 
In both cases, the fact that the theory is independent of something means one can set 
up differential equations such as d~ X = 0, d~o X = ° or d~ X = 0, where X is some 
observable. Solving these differential equations leads to a trajectory in the space of theo-
ries. The term renormalization group (RG) or renormalization group evolution refers to the

flow along these trajectories. In practice, there are three types of things whose RG evo

nearby sites and get the same answer, with an appropriately rescaled value of the spin-sPin 
interaction strength. Thus, there should be a transformation by which nearby degrees of 
freedom are replaced by a single effective degree of freedom and parameters of the theor 
are changed accordingly. This is known as a block-spin renormalization group, and wa~ 
first introduced by Leo Kadanoff in the mid 1960s [Kadanoff, 1966]. In the continuum 
limit, this replacement becomes a differential equation known as the RG equation, Which 
was first understood by Kenneth Wilson in the early 1970s [Wilson, 1971]. 
The Wilsonian RG can be implemented through the path integral, an approach clari-
fied by Joseph PoJchinski in the mid 1980s [PoJchinski, 1984]. There, one can literally 
integrate out all the short-distance degrees of freedom of a field, say at energies E > A, 
making the path integral a function of the cutoff A. Changing A to A' and demanding 
physics be the same (since A is arbitrary) means that the couplings in the theory, Such 
as the gauge coupling g, must depend on A. Taking A' close to A induces a differential 
equation on the couplings, also known as the renormalization group equation. This induces 
a flow in the coupling constants of the theory as a function of the effective cutoff. Note, 
the RG is not a group in the traditional mathematical sense, only in the sense that it maps 
9 ---; g, where 9 is the set of couplings in a theory. 
Implementing the Wilsonian RG picture in field theory, either through a lattice or 
through the path integral, is a mess from a practical point of view. For actual calculations, at 
least in high-energy contexts, the continuum RG is exclusively used. In the continuum pic-
ture, the RG is an invariance to the arbitrary scale one chooses to define the renormalized 
couplings. In dimensional regularization, this scale is implicitly set by the dimension-
ful parameter f.J,. This approach to renormalization was envisioned by Stueckelberg and 
Petermann in 1953 [Stueckelberg and Petermann, 1953] and made precise the year after 
by Gell-Mann and Low [Gell-Mann and Low, 1954]. It found widespread application to 
particle physics in the early 1970s through the work of Callan and Symanzik [Callan, 
1970; Symanzik, 1970], who applied the RG to conelation functions in renormalizable 
theories. Applications of the enormous power of the continuum renormalization group to 
precision calculations in non-renormalizable theories, such as the Chiral Lagrangian, the 
4-Fermi theory, heavy-quark effective theory, etc., have been developing since the 19705, 
and continue to develop today. We will cover these examples in detail in Parts IV and V. 
The continuum RG is an extremely practical tool for getting partial results for high-
order loops from low-order loops. Recall from Section 16.3 that the difference between 
the momentum-space Coulomb potential V(t) at two scales, tl and t2, was propoJtional to

23.1 Running couplings 
Let us begin by reviewing what we have already shown about scale-dependent coupling 
constants. The scale-dependent electric charge, eeff(fi), showed up as a natural object in 
Chapter 16, where we calculated the vacuum polarization effect, and also in Chapter 20, 
where it played a role in the total cross section for e+ e-
---+ fi+ fi- (+y). In this section, 
we review the effective coupling and point out some important features exploited by the 
renormalization group. 
23.1.1 Large logarithms 
In Chapters 16 and 19 we calculated the vacuum polmization diagrams at I-loop and found 
(Eq. (19.29)) 
~+~

The entire functional form of this potential is phenomenologlcally important, especial 
at low energies, where we saw it gives the Uehling potential and contributes to the La Iy

In this limit, we can see clearly the problem of large logarithms, which the RG will sOlv

This is the effective coupling including the I-loop IPI graphs, This is called leading-
logarithmic resummation. 
Once all of these 1 PI I-loop contributions are included, the next terms we are missing 
should be subleading in some expansion. The terms included in the effective charge are 
of the form e~ ( e~ In ~ ) n for n :::::: O. For the 2-100p 1 PI contributions to be subleading, 
they should be of the form e'k ( e~ In ~ ) n . However, it is not obvious at this point that 
2 
there cannot be a contribution of the form e~ ln2 ~ from a 2-loop IPI graph. To check, 
we would need to perform the full 0 (e'k) calculation, including graphs with loops and 
counterterms. As you might imagine, trying to resum large logarithms beyond the leading-
logarithmic level diagrammatically is extremely impractical. The RG provides a shortcut 
to systematic resurnmation beyond the leading-logarithmic level. 
The key to systematizing the above QED calculation is to first observe that the probleJll 
we are trying to solve is one of large logarithms. If there were no large logarithms, we

V(p2) has both explicit P6 dependence, as in Eq. (23.5), and implicit P6 dependence, 
through the scale where eR is defined. In fact, recalling that eR was defin:d so that 
P5V(P6) = e~ exactly, and that ~he effective charge is defined by e:ff (p2) == p2V(p2), we 
can make the P6 dependence of V(p2) explicit by replacing eR by eeff(p6). 
So, Eq. (23.5) becomes

which is the same effective charge that we got above by summing IPI diagrams. 
Note, however, that we did not need to talk about the geometric series or IPI diagrams 
at all to arrive at Eq. (23.13); we only used the I-loop graph. In this way, the RO efficiently 
encodes information about some higher-order Feynman diagrams without having to be 
explicit about which diagrams are included. This improvement in efficiency is extremely 
helpful, especially in problems with multiple couplings, or beyond I-loop. 
23.1.2 Universality of large logarithms 
Before getting to the systematics of the RO, let us think about the large logarithms in a little 
Ihore detail. Large logarithms arise when one scale is much bigger or much smaller than 
every other relevant scale. In the vacuum polarization calculation, we considered the limit 
Where the off-shellness p2 of the photon was much larger than the electron mass m 2 . In the 
limit where one scale is much larger than all the other scales, we can set all the other phys-
ical scales to zero to first approximation. If we do this in the vacuum polarization diagram 
421 

422 
The renormalization group 
we find from Eq. (23.2) that the full vacuum polarization function II (p2) = e~II2 (p2) H 
at order e2 is 
3 
R 
II(p2 ) = 1~~2 [~ + In C.:";2 ) + const.] + 03 
(DR) , 
(23.14) 
where "const." is independent of p. 
The equivalent result using a regulator with a dimensional UV cutoff, such as Pauli_ 
Villars, is 
II(p2) = 
e~ 2 [In ( A 22) + const.] + 03 
(PV) . 
1271' 
- p 
(23.15) 
As was discussed in Chapters 21 and 22, the logarithmic, non-analytic dependence on 
momentum is characteristic of a loop effect and a true quantum prediction. The RG fOCUses 
in on these logarithmic terms, which give the dominant quantum effects in certain limits. 
If the only physical scale is p2, the logarithm of p2 must be compensated by a logarithm 
of some other unphysical scale, in this case, the cutoff A 2 (or f-L2 in dimensional regulariza_ 
tion) .. If we renormalize the theory at some scale Po by defining 03 = -1~~2 ln~, then 
this becomes 
0 
(PV) . 
(23.16) 
In dimensional regularization, the MS prescription is that 03 = 1~~2 ( -
~), so that 
II(p2) = 1~~2 [In(~:) +const.] 
(DR) . 
(23.17) 
In Eqs. (23.14) to (23.17), the logarithmic dependence on the unphysical scales A2, p~ or 
f-L2 uniquely determines the logarithmic dependence of the amplitude on the physical scale 
p2. The Wilsonian RG extracts physics from the In A 2 dependence (see Section 23.6), 
while the continuum RG uses p~ or f-L2. 
In practical applications of the RG, dimensional regularization is almost exclusively 
used. It is therefore impOltant to understand the roles of c = 4- d, the arbitrary scale f-L2 and 
scales such as p~ where couplings are defined. Ultraviolet divergences show up as poles of 
the form : . Do not confuse the scale f-L, which was added to make quantities dimensionally 
cOiTect, with a UV cutoff! Removing the cutoff is taking c ---> 0, not f-L ---> 00 . In minimal 
subtraction, renormalized amplitudes depend on f-L. In observables, such as the difference 
pi if (pi) -
p~ if (p~) , f-L necessarily drops out. However, one can imagine choosing 
03 = 
e~ [_ ~_lnf-L2] 
1271'2 
c 
p~ 
(23.18) 
in dimensional regularization so that Eq. (23.14) turns into Eq. (23.16). This is equivalent 
to choosing f-L2 = p~ in Eq. (23.14) and minimally subtracting the: term. Thus, we usually 
think of f-L as a physical scale where amplitUdes are renonnalized and f-L is often called the 
renormalization scale. 
Although we choose f-L to be a physical scale, observables should be independent of J-b. 
At fixed order in perturbation theory, verifying f-L independence can be a strong theoretical

and we never have to talk about the physical scale Po explicitly. 
Although fl, is a physical, low-energy scale, not taken to 00, the dependence of ampli-
tudes on fl, is closely connected with the dependences on ~. For example, in the vacuum 
polarization calculation, the In fl,2 dependence came from the expansion 
fl,c(~-lnp2 + ... ) =~+ln~~ +.... 
(23.20) 
The ~ pole and the In fl,2 in unrenormalized amplitudes are inseparable - in four dimen-
sions, there is no E and no fl,. In particular, the numerical coefficient of ~ is the same as 
2 
the coefficient of In ~. Thus, even in dimensional regularization, the large logarithms of 
the physical scale pI are connected to UV divergences, as they would be in a theory with 
a UV regulator A. Since the large logarithms correspond to UV divergences, it is possible 
to resum them entirely from the E dependence of the counterterms. This leads to the more 
efficient, but more abstract, derivation of the continuum RGE, as we now show. 
23.2 Renormalization group from counterterms 
2 
We have seen how large logarithms of the form In~ can be resummed though a dif-
P2 
ferential equation which establishes that physical quantities are independent of the scale 
P6 where the renorrnalized coupling is defined. Dealing directly with physical renormal-
ization conditions for general amplitudes is extremely tedious. In this section, we will 
develop the continuum RG with dimensional regularization, exploiting the observations 
made in the previous section: the large logarithms are associated with UV divergences, 
which determine the fl, dependence of amplitudes; fl,2 can be used as a proxy for the (arbi-
trary) physical renormalization scale P6; the ROE will then come from fl, independence of 
physical quantities. 
Let us first recall where the factors of fl, come from. Recall our bare Lagrangian for QED: 
(23.21) 
The quantities appearing here are infinite, or if we are in d = 4 -
E dimensions they are 
finite but scale as inverse powers of E. The dimensions of the fields can be read off from 
the Lagrangian:

with eR and the Zx dimensionless, even in d = 4 -
E dimensions. (In this chapter We 
will use the charge renormalization Ze instead of Zl, which we defined in Chapter 19 as 
Zl = ZeZ2~') Recall also from Chapter] 9 the I-loop MS counterterms (Eq. (19.66)): 
J - ~

where each of these counterterms is defined by Z x = 1 + J x .

At leading order in eR, Ze = 1 and so

At next order, we have

where Eq. (23.27) has been used in the last step. So, 
(23.29) 
This is the leading-order QED ,a-function. Taking E ----7 0, this agrees with Eq. (23.19) (and 
Eq. (16.73)) when we identify eR(J1,) = eeff(J1,), but here we calculated the ROE using only 
counterterms with no mention of logarithms. 
It is worth tracing back to which diagrams contributed to the ,B-function. The ,B-function 
depended on Ze = Z2Jze' In Chapter 19 we found Zl from the 1{;A/l'l/J vertex, Z3 came 
from the vacuum polarization diagrams, and Z2 from the electron self-energy. In QED, 
since Zl = Z2, the ,B-function can be calculated from Z3 alone, which is why Eq. (23.29) 

23.2 Renormalization group from counterterms

~grees with Eq. (23.19). In other theories, such as QCD, Zl -=I Z2 and all three diagrams 
will contribute. As we will see in Chapter 26, we will need to Use the full relation !5e =

The ,6-function is sometimes written as a function of Q = ~ defined by 
do: 
,6(0:) == f-t-. 
df-t 
The expansion is conventionally written as 
(23.30) 
(23.31) 
Matching to Eq. (23.29) in d = 4 then gives ,60 = -l At leading order (at E = 0), the 
solution is 
(23.32) 
which increases with f-t. Here, AQED is an integration constant fixed by the boundary con-
dition of the RGE. Using o:(me = 511 keY) = 1~7 we find AQED = 10286 eY. Since 0: 
blows up when f-t = A QED , AQED is the location of the Landau pole. 
In writing the solution to the RGE in Eq. (23.32) we have swapped a dimensionless 
number, 1~7' for a dimensionful scale A QED . This is known as dimensional transmuta-
tion. When we introduced the effective charge, we specified a scale and the value of 0: 
measured at that scale. But now we see that only a scale is needed. This uncovers a very 
profound misconception about nature: electrodynamics is fundamentally not defined by 
the electric charge, as you learned classically, but by a dimensionful scale A QED . More-
over, this scale only has meaning if there is another scale in the theory, such as the electron 
mass, so really it is the ratio mel AQED that specifies QED completely. 
While we have the counterterms handy, let us work out the RGE for the electron mass. 
The bare mass m O must be independent of f-t, so

We conventionally define

1m is called an anomalous dimension. (This terminology will be explained in Sec-

23.3 Renormalization group equation for the 
4-Fermi theory 
We have seen that the RGE for the electric charge allows us to resum large logarithms 
of kinematic scales, for example in Coulomb scattering. In that case, the logarithms Were 
resummed through the running electric charge. Large logarithms can also appear in pretty 
much any scattering process, with any Lagrangian, whether renormalizable or not. In fact 
non-renormalizable theories, with their infinite number of operators, provide a great aren~ 
for understanding the variety of possible RGEs. We will begin with a concrete example: 
large logarithmic corrections to the muon decay rate from QED. Then we discuss the gen-
eralization for renormalizing operators in the Lagrangian and external operators inserted 
into Green's functions. 
The muon decays into an electron and two neutrinos through an intermediate off-shell W 
boson. In the Standard Model, the decay rate comes from the following tree-level diagram, 
which leads to 
(23.37) 
plus corrections suppressed by additional factors of !!!:.i!:.. or m e , with 9 = 0.64 the weak

coupling constant and mw = 80.4 GeV (see Chapter 29 for more details). A photon loop

This approximation leads to the 4-Fermi theory, discussed briefly in Section 22.2 and to 
be discussed in more detail here and extensively in Part IV. The 4-Fermi theory replaces 
the W boson with a set of effective interactions involving four fermions. The relevant 
Lagrangian interaction in this case is 
(23.40) 
where PL = 1-215 projects onto left-handed fermions and G F 
= 
svlzg2 = 1.166 x 
mw 
10- 5 Ge V- 2 (see Section 29.4 for the derivation of Eq. (23.40)). This leads to a decay 
5 
rate of f (p,-
----7 1/l-'e- v e ) = G} 1~~3' which agrees with Eq. (23.37). The point of doing 
this is twofold: first, the 4-Fermi theory is simpler than the theory with the full propagat-
ing W boson; second, we can use the RG to compute the RG evolution of G F that will 
reproduce the large logarithms in Eq. (23.38) and let us resum them to all orders in a . 
It is not hard to go from the RGE for the electric charge to the RGE for a general operator. 
Indeed, the electric charge can be thought of as the coefficient of the operator Oe = 7jJj..'ljJ 
in the QED Lagrangian. The RGE was determined by the renormalization factor Ze = 
Z2~' which was calculated from the radiative correction to the 7jJj..'ljJ vertex (this gave 
Zl), and then subtracting off the field strength renormalizations that came from the electron 
self-energy graph and vacuum polarization graphs (giving Z2 and Z3, respectively). 
Unfortunately for the pedagogical purposes of this example, in the actual weak theory, 
the coefficient A of the large logarithm in Eq. (23.38) is 0 (see Problem 23.2). This fact is 
closely related to the non-renormalization of the QED current (see Section 23.4.1 below) 
and is somewhat of an accident. For example, a similar process for the weak decays of 
quarks does have a non-zero coefficient of the large logarithm, proportional to the strong 
COupling constant as (see Section 31.3). To get something non-zero, let us pretend that 
the weak interaction is generated by the exchange of a neutral scalar instead, so that the 
4-Fermi interaction is 
427 

428 
The renormalization group 
In this case, we will get a non-zero coefficient of the large logarithm. 
To calculate the renormalization factor for G, we must compute the I-loop cOlTection t 
this 4-Fermi interaction. There is only one diagram,

To get at the ROE, we just need the counterterm, which comes from the coefficient of the 
UV divergence of this amplitude. To that end, we can set all the external momenta and

To remove this divergence, we have to renormalize G. We do so by writing G = G RZe,

To extract the counterterm, we expand Ze = 1 + oe. The counterterm then contributes

a vector boson coupled to left-handed spinors, the anomalous dimension for the operator 
in Eq. (23.40) is zero and so G F does not run in QED. 
23.4 Renormalization group equation for general 
interactions 
In the muon decay example, we calculated the running of G, defined as the coefficient of 
the local operator Oc = Zc (1/J/l1/Je) (1/Jvc 1/JvJ in a 4-Fermi Lagrangian. More generally, 
429 

430 
The renormalization group 
we can consider adding additional operators to QED, with an effective Lagrangian of the 
form 
I: = - ~ Z3F;v + Z~7jjii (j)'ljJi -
Z~Z:nmf-7jji'ljJi + ZeZ2 i ~QieR{vt'ljJi + L Cj OJ (a:). 
J 
(23.54) 
These operators, OJ = Zjo",.ymA,,(x)··· Av(x)7jjil (x) ... 'ljJjn (x), are composite local 
operators, with all fields evaluated at the same space-time point. They can have any nUm_ 
ber of photons, ferrnions, , -matrices, factors of the metric, etc. and analytic (power-law) 
dependence on derivatives. Keep in mind that the fields A" and 'ljJj are the renormalized 
fields. The Cj are known as Wilson coefficients. Note that in this convention each Zj is 
grouped with its corresponding operator, which is composed ofrenormalized fields; the Z. 
is not included in the Wilson coefficient so that the Wilson coefficient will be a finite num~ 
ber at any given scale. Since the Lagrangian is independent of J-L, if we assume no mixing, 
the RGEs take the form 
d 
J-L -
(CO) = 0 
(no sum on j) . 
dJ-L 
J 
J 
(23.55) 
These equations (one for each j) let us extract the RG evolution of Wilson coefficients from 
the J-L dependence of matrix elements of operators. In general, there can be mixing among 
the operators (see Section 23.5.2 and Section 31.3), in which case this equation must be 
generalized to J-L d~ (2:= j Cj OJ) = O. One can also have mixing between the operators and 
the other terms in the Lagrangian in Eq. (23.54), in which case the RGE is just J-L d~ I: = O. 
The way these effective Lagrangians are used is that the Cj are first either calculated or 
measured at some scale J-Lo. We can calculate them if we have a (full) theory that is equiva-
lent to this (effective) theory at a particular scale. For example, we found G F by designing 
the 4-Fermi theory to reproduce the muon decay rate from the full electroweak theory, to 
leading order in + at the scale J-Lo = mw . This is known as matching. Altematively, 
mli" 
if a full theory to Which our effective Lagrangian can be matched is not known (or is not 
perturbative), one can simply measure the Cj at some scale J-La. For example, in the Chiral 
Lagrangian (describing the low-energy theory of pions) one could in principle match to the 
theory of strong interactions (QCD), but in practice it is easier just to measure the Wilson 
coefficients. In either case, once the values of the Cj are set at some scale, we can solve 
the RGE to resum large logarithms. In the toy muon-decay example, we evol ved G R to the 
scale J-L = m" in order to incorporate large logarithmic corrections of the form a In :::~, 
into the rate calculation. 
23.4.1 External operators 
Equation (23.55) implies that the RG evolution of Wilson coefficients is exactly compen-
sated for by the RG evolution of the operators. Operator running provides a useful language 
in which to consider physical implications of the RG. An important example is the running 
of the current J" (x) = ZJ1/;(x h"'ljJ(x), which we will now explore. Rather than thinking 
of J" as the coefficient of A" in the QED interaction, we will treat J,,(x) as an external 

23.4 Renormalization group equation for general interactions 
,---------------------------------------------------
operator: an operator that is not part of the Lagrangian, but which can be inserted into 
Green's functions. 
The running of JI'- is determined by the fL dependence of ZJ and of the renormalized 
fields 1jJ(x) and 'I/J(x) appearing in the operator. To find ZJ, we can calculate any Green's 
function involving JI'-. The simplest non-vanishing one is the 3-point function with the 
current and two fields, whose Fourier transform we already discussed in the context of the 
Ward-Takahashi identity in Section 14.8 and the proof of Z1 = Z2 in Section 19.5. We 
define

At next-to-leading order, there is a IPI loop contribution and a counterterm: 
(23.58) 
Here the ® indicates an insertion of the current and the * indicates the counterterm 
for the current, both with incoming momentum pl". The counterterm contribution to the 
Green's function comes from expanding ZJ = 1 + 6J directly in the Green's function (we 
have not added JI" to the Lagrangian). These two graphs give, in Feynman gauge,

(23.60)

Thus, 6J = 1~~2 [-:l, which also happens to equal 62 and 61. Thus Z2 = ZJ at I-loop. 
Now that we know ZJ we can calculate the renormalization of the current. The bare 
Current is independent of fL. Since Jt:are(x) = 7[;0"(1'-'1/)0 = L Z2JI"(x), then

The renormalization group 
--------------------------------------------~ 
Thus, the current does not run. In other words, whatever scale we measure the current a 
it will have the same value. To be clear, the current is renormalized, but it does not /. t, 
d. 
. 
1111. 
Defining the anomalous ImenSlOn 'Y J for the current by 
we have found that 
d 
t-t-JJ.L = 'YJJJ.L 
dt-t 
'YJ = O. 
That is, the anomalous dimension for the current vanishes. 
(23.62) 
(23.63) 
As you might have figured out by now, the Ward-Takahashi identity implies 'YJ = 0 to 
all orders. In fact, 'YJ = 0 is just the RG version of the Ward-Takahashi identity, which 
actually has a nice physical interpretation. The vanishing anomalous dimension of the CUr_ 
rent is equivalent to the statement that the total number of particles minus the number of 
antiparticles does not depend on the scale at which we count them. To see this, observe 
that the 0 component of the renormalized current when integrated over all space gives a 
conserved total charge: 
Q = 1 
d3x Jo = 1 
d3x 1j; t 1j; = total charge. 
(23.64) 
This does not change with time, since the current vanishes at infinity and 
OtQ = 
d xooJo = 
d xV'· J = J(oo) = O. 
13 
13~~ ~ 
(23.65) 
To see what Q does, note that since the (renormalized) fields at the same time anticommute, 
{1j;t(x),1j;(y)} = 83 (x - y),wehave 
1j;(x)Q = 1 
d3y1j;(x) 1j;t(y) 1j;(y) = Q1j;(x) + 1 
d3y83(x - y) 1j;(y) = Q1j;(x) + 1j;(x), 
(23.66) 
and 
Q1j;t(x) = J 
d3y1j;t(y) 1j;(y) 1j;t(x) =1j;t(x)Q+ J 
d3y83(x-y)1j;t(y) =1j;t(x)Q+1j;t(x). 
(23.67) 
So, 
[Q ,1j;]=-1j;, 
(23.68) 
That is, Q counts the number of particles minus antiparticles. The fields 1j; can be (and are) 
scale dependent. Thus, the only way for these equations to be satisfied is if Q does not have 
scale dependence itself. Thus, the current cannot run. 
23.4.2 Lagrangian operators versus external operators -
There is of course not much difference between the calculation of the RGE for the 
coefficients of operators in a Lagrangian or for external operators. In fact, the relation 
(23.69) 

23.4 Renormalization group equation for general interactions 
,-------------------------------------------------------
implies that the RGE for the Wilson coefficient and the operator it mUltiplies carry the 
same information. 
Some distinctions between external operators and operators in the Lagrangian include: 
1. External operators do not have to be Lorentz invariant, while operators in the 
Lagrangian do. 
Z. External operators can insert momentum into a Feynman diagram, while operators in 
the Lagrangian just give Feynman rules that are momentum conserving. 
3. For external operators, it is the operators themselves that run, whereas for operators 
in a Lagrangian we usually talk about their Wilson coefficients as having the scale 
dependence. 
In this sense, an operator in the Lagrangian is a special case of an external operator, which 
is Lorentz invariant and evaluated at p = O. For example, we can treat the 4-Fermi operator 
OF = {;,i-' PL 'I/J{;,i-' PL 'I/J as external. Then, we can determine its anomalous dimension 
by evaluating 
(23.70) 
This will amount to the same Feynman diagram as in Section 23.3, but now we can have 
momentum pi-' coming in at the vertex. As far as the RGE is concerned, we only need the 
UV divergences, which are independent of external momentum. So, in this case we would 
find that the operator runs with the same RGE that its Wilson coefficient had before. That 
is, it runs with exactly what is required by d~ (G FO F) = o. 
23.4.3 Renormalization group equation for Green's 
functions 
We have now discussed the RGE for operators, coupling constants and scalar masses. We 
can also consider directly the running of Green's functions. Consider, for example, the bare 
Green's function of n photons and m fermions in QED: 
(23.71) 
This is constructed out of bare fields, and since there is no J.L in the bare Lagrangian, this 
is J.L independent. The bare Green's function is infinite, but it is related to the renormalized 
Green's function by

The renormalization group 
Defining 
(23.75) 
this reduces to 
(23.76) 
This equation is known variously as the Callan-Symanzik equation, the Gell-Mann_ 
Low equation, the 't Hooft-Weinberg equation and the Georgi-Politzer equation. (The 
differences refer to different schemes, such as MS or the on-shell physical renormalization 
scheme.) 
One can also calculate Green's functions with external operators inserted, such as 
(DIT{ Y'(x) 1/11 (Xl) ~2(X2)}ID) considered in Section 23.4.1. For a general operator, we 
define

If there are more operators, there will be more 10 terms. 
23.4.4 Anomalous dimensions 
(23.77) 
(23.78) 
Now let us discuss the term "anomalous dimension". We have talked about the mass dimen-
sion of a field many times. For example, in four dimensions, [¢J = Ml, [mJ = Ml, 
[1/;J = M 3/ 2 and so on. These numbers just tell us what happens if we change units. To be 
more precise, consider the action for ¢4: 
s = J 
d4x [-~¢(D + m 2)¢ + 9¢4] . 
(23.79) 
This has a symmetry under xp. -7 txp., op. -7 )...op., m -7 )...m, 9 -7 9 and ¢ -7 )...¢. This 
operation is called dilatation and denoted by V. Thus, 
(23.80) 
The do are called the classical or canonical scaling dimensions of the various fields and 
couplings in the theory. 

23.5 Scalar masses and renormalization group flows 
,------------------------------------------------
NoW consider a correlation function 
(23.81) 
In a classical theory, this Green's function can only depend on the various quantities in the 
Lagrangian raised to various powers: 
(23.82) 
BY dimensional analysis, we must have a -
Cl -
... -
Cn 
n. Thus we expect that 
1J: Gn -7 Anen. 
In the quantum theory, en can also depend on the scale where the theory is renormalized, 
p. So we could have 
(23.83) 
where now a - Cl - ... - en = n - I. Note that f-L does not transform under D since it does 
not appear in the Lagrangian - it is the subtraction point used to connect to experiment. So 
when we act with D, only the x and m terms change; thus, we find D : en -7 An- ,en. 
Thus, en does not have the canonical scaling dimension. In particular, 
d 
f-L df-L en = ,en, 
(23.84) 
which is how we have been defining anomalous dimensions. Thus, the anomalous 
dimensions tell us about deviations from the classical scaling behavior. 
23.5 Scalar masses and renormalization 
group flows 
In this section we will examine the RG evolution of a super-renormalizable operator, 
namely a scalar mass term m 2¢2. To extract physics from running masses, we have to 
think of masses more generally than just the location of the renormalized physical pole in 
an S-matrix, since by definition the pole mass is independent of scale. Rather, we should 
think of them as a term in a potential, like a ¢4 interaction would be. This language is 
very natural in condensed matter physics. As we will now see, in an off-shell scheme 
(such as MS) masses can have scale dependence. This scale dependence can induce phase 
transitions and signal spontaneous symmetry breaking (see Chapters 28 and 34). 
23.5.1 Yukawa potential correction 
Recall that the exchange of a massive particle generates a Yukawa potential, with the mass 
giving the characteristic scale of the interactions. Just as the Coulomb potential let us 
understand the physics of a running coupling, the Yukawa potential will help us understand 
running scalar masses. For example, consider the Lagrangian 
(23.85) 
435 

436 
The renormalization group 
which has the scalar field interacting with some extemal current J. The cunent-cUr .. 
interaction at leading order comes from an exchange of ¢, which generate the YUka~~11 
potential. For the static potential, we can drop time derivative and Lhen Fourier transfor a

(23.86) 
In the language of condensed matter physics, this correlation function has a COITelation 
length ~ given by the inverse mass, ~ = ~. In this language, we can easily give a phYSical 
interpretation to a running mass: the Yukawa potential will be modified by m --> m(r) 
with calculable logarithmic dependence on r. 
To calculate m( r) we will solve the RG evolution induced by the A¢4 interaction. The 
first step to studying the RGE for this theory is to renormalize it at I-loop, for which 
we need to introduce the various Z-factors into the Lagrangian. In terms of renormalized 
fields,

(23.87) 
Since ¢ has mass dimension d;2, an extra factor of p,4-d has been added to keep All 
dimensionless, as was done for the electric charge in QED. The RGE for the mass comes 
from the p, independence of the bare mass, m 2 = m~Zm: 
(23.88) 
Since the only p, dependence in the Lagrangian comes from the ¢4 interaction, we need to 
compute the dependence of Om on AR and the dependence of AR on p,. 
We can extract Zm (and Z"') from corrections to the scalar propagator. The leading 
graph is

(23.89) 
The quadratic divergence in this integral shows up in dimensional regularization as a pole 
at d = 2 but is hidden if one expands near d = 4. Nevertheless, since quadratic divergences 
are just absorbed into the counterterrns, we can safely ignore them and focus on the log-
arithmic divergences. After all, it is the non-analytic logarithmic momentum dependence 
that we will resum using the renormalization group. 
Expanding in d = 4 - E dimensions, ~2 (p2) = \~,;1 i + ... . The counterterms from

So, to order AR, 0", = 0 and 6rn =

An alternative way to extract these counterterms is to use the propagator of the massless 
theory and to treat m~¢2 as a perturbation. This does not change the physics, since the

from the quadraticall y divergent integral. 
Next, we need the dependence of AR on p,. The ROE for AR is derived by using that the

Then, since 6).. starts at order AR we have p, d~ AR = -cAR + 0 (A 'k). Although not

from the radiative correction to the 4-point function. With zero external momenta, the loop

In the free theory, ~ scales as mol, by dimensional analysis. With interactions we see 
that it scales as mo to a different power of the mass, determined by v. This quantity v is 
known as a critical exponent. Dimensional transmutation has given us another scale with 
dimensions of mass, ro1, which has changed the scaling relation predicted by dimensional 
analysis. These critical exponents have been measured in a number of situations. We next 
discuss how to compare the result of our RG calculation to experimental results. 
23.5.2 Wilson-Fisher fixed point 
It is a remarkable experimental fact that very different physical systems exhibit very similar 
scaling behaviors in the vicinity of second-order phase transitions. For example, for many 
materials there is a critical point in the phase diagram when the liquid-gas phase transition 
becomes second order. In water, this critical point is at a critical temperature Tc = 173°C 
and a critical pressure Pc = 217 atm. One can measure correlation functions in water 
(for example by scattering light off it) and extract from those functions a characteristic 
scale ~ called the correlation length. For example, measuring the intensity of light as a 
function of momentum, one might find I(q) = 10(1 + q2~2)-1. In water, near its critical 
point, the correlation length is found to scale with temperature as ~ rv (T - Tc) -0,63. This 
0.63 is an example of a critical exponent. This particular critical exponent is called v and 
conventionally defined by ~ rv (T - Tc)-v. Remarkably, this scaling behavior with the 
same exponent v = 0.63, can be seen in thousands of other systems, with very different 
microscopic descriptions, near their critical points (see [Pelissetto and Vicari, 2002] for a 
review). A very important example is the 3D Ising model (defined on a rectangular lattice 
with nearest-neighbor spin-spin interactions). The set of systems that share this scaling 
behavior near their critical points are said to be in the 3D Ising model universality class. 
The universality of the critical exponent v suggests that it should be calculable without 
detailed knowledge of the microscopic system. In fact it can. Moreover, the universality 
can be understood with the RG. 
The starting point for a calculation of v from field theory is to represent the Ising model 
system with a single scalar field. For water, this field, ¢(x), might be the density, but it 
does not actually matter what the field is. All that matters is that the effective description 
shares the symmetries of the microscopic theory (in the case of Ising model systems, there 
is no symmetry and so a single scalar field will do). The effective description of a field 
theory near a second-order phase transition can be described by a Ginzburg-Landau model 
defined by the Lagrangian

Thus, corrections to the critical exponent are given by an anomalous dimension calculable

(23.105) 
But, what do we take for jJ and what do we take for AR? Here we atTive at the key reason 
for universality of critical exponents: although mR and AR are in general scale dependent, 
for certain values of mR and AR we may find that the right-hand sides of Eqs. (23.104) 
and (23.105) vanish. It is precisely at these values, which are fixed points of the RG evolu-
tion equations, that systems become universal. A simple example of a fixed point is where 
AR = mR = 0, or more generally when all couplings and masses vanish. Such a solution, 
for which all the RGEs are trivial, is known as a Gaussian fixed point (since at this point 
the Lagrangian is a free theory of a massless scalar field and the path integral is an exact 
Gaussian). To calculate v we want to find a non-trivial fixed point. 
In condensed matter physics we are interested in the macroscopic, long-distance behav-
ior of a system. In particle physics we are interested usually in the low-energy limit of a 
system, which is most accessible experimentally. So, in either case we would like to know 
What happens as we lower jJ. The behavior of a system as jJ is lowered gives the RG tra-
jectory or RG flow of the couplings in a system. For example, suppose we start near (but 
not on) the Gaussian fixed point. Then the RGE for AR at leacting order is dJ~nA,"R = - c, 
Which implies that if d > 4 (c < 0), the system will flow back towards the fixed point as 
jJ decreases, while for d < 4 (c > 0), the system will flow away from the fixed point. The

(23.107) 
Although the values of 771* and A* are scheme dependent and therefore unphysical, the crit-
ical exponents are scheme independent. Indeed, they must be, since they can be measured. 
You can explore the scheme dependence of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in Problem 23.6. 
See [Wilson and Kogut, 1974; Pelissetto and Vicari, 2002] or [Sachdev. 2011, Chapter 4] 
for more information. 
For c = 1 corresponding to three dimensions, 11 = 0.6 at this point, which is quite 
close to the observed value of 0.63. This (somewhat questionable) practice of expanding 
around d = 4 to get results in d = 3 is known as the epsilon expansion. You can compute 
the 2-100p value of 11 in Problem 23.5. Currently, 11 is known to 5-100ps in the epsilon 
expansion [Kleinert et aI., 1991] and has been computed many other ways (with Monte-
Carlo methods, high- or low-temperature expansions, Borel resummed perturbation theory, 
etc.). See [Pelissetto and Vicari, 2002] for a review. 
Regardless of whether the epsilon expansion can be justified, we can at least trust the 
qualitative observation of Wilson and Fisher. that there is a non-trivial fixed point (cou-
plings do not all vanish) in this effective theory for d < 4. As c increases, the fixed point 
will move away from the A*, due to large c2 corrections. This justifies the universality 
of the critical exponents in three-dimensional systems - even if we cannot calculate the 
anomalous dimension, we expect that for d < 3 it should still exist and should be separate 
from the Gaussian fixed point. 
Fixed points are interesting places. Exactly on the fixed point, the theory is scale invari-
ant, since /L d: m'h = /L d: AR = O. While there are many classical theories that are scale 
invariant (such as QED with massless fermions), theories that are scale invariant at the 
quantum level are much rarer. Such theories are known as conformal field theories. In 
a conformal theory, the Poincare group is enhanced Lo a larger group called the confor-
mal group. Recall that the Poincare group aoting on CUl1cLi n of space-time is gcnenlted 
by translations, Pf-L = -iOf-L' and Lorentz tran format.i n , 
/lV = 'i (x/IOV - ,'1;,,8,.)-
In the conformal group, these are supplemented with a generator for scale !ran for-
mations, D = -ixf-Lof-L, and four generators for special-conformal transformations. 
Kf-L = i (x 2 of-L - 2xf-Lxl/ol/). Invariance under the conformal group is so restrictive that 

23.5 Scalar masses and renormalization group flows 
Renormalization group flow in the Wilson-Fisher theory. The Wilson-Fisher fixed point is 
indicated by the * at m* = 0 and A = A*. The Gaussian fixed point at m = A = 0 is 
indicated by the o. The arrows denote flow as the length scale is increased, or equivalently, 
as f1 is decreased. Although the location of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is scheme 
dependent, the trajectories near the fixed point can be used to extract 
scheme-independent information about the conformal field theory living on the fixed point 
(such as critical exponents). 
correlation functions in conformal field theories are strongly constrained. On the other 
hand, conformal field theories do not have massive particles. In fact, they do not have par-
ticles at all. That is, there is no sensible way to define asymptotic single-particle states in 
such a theory. Thus, they do not have an S-matrix. 
One way to find conformal field theories is by looking for fixed points of RG flows 
in non-conformal field theories, as in the Wilson-Fisher example. Since conformal field 
theories have no inherent scales, dimensional parameters such as mR in the Wilson-Fisher 
theory become dimensionless. To see how the fixed point is approached, it is natural to 
rescale away any classical scaling dimension of the various couplings. In the Wilson-Fisher 
case, we do this by defining mR(/-L) 
ImR(/-L) so that mR is dimensionless. Then the

23.5.3 Varieties of asymptotic behavior 
---
One can easily imagine more complicated RG flows than those described by the Wilson_ 
Fisher theory. With just one coupling, such as in QED or in QCD, the RG flow is 
determined by the (J-function (J( 0:) = P, d~ 0:. When the coupling is small, the theory is 
perturbative, and then the coupling must either increase or decrease with scale. If the Cou. 
pling increases with p" as in QED, it goes to zero at long distances. In this case it is said 
to be infrared free. If it decreases with p, (as the strong coupling in QCD does, as we will 
show in Chapter 26), it goes to zero at shOlt distances and the theory is said to be asymptot. 
ically free. The third possibility in a perturbative theory is that (J( 0:) = 0 exactly, in Which 
case the theory is scale invariant. If the coupling is non-perturbative, one can still define a 
coupling through the value of a Green's function. Then, as long as (J( 0:) > 0 at one 0: and 
(J(o:) < 0 at a larger 0:, there is guaranteed to be an intermediate value where (J(o:*) == O. 
With mUltiple couplings there are other possibilities for solutions to the RGEs. For exam-
ple, one could imagine a situation in which couplings circle around each other. It is 
certainly easy to write down coupled differential equations with bizarre solutions; whether 
such equations correspond to anything in nature or in a laboratory is another question. 
There are not many known examples of perturbative conformal field theories in four 
dimensions. One is called N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. Another possibility is if the 
leading (J-function coefficient is small, for example if (J(o:) = (J00:2 + (Jl0:3 + ... , where 
(Jo happens to be of order 0:. Then there could be a cancellation between (Jo and (Jl and a 
non-trivial fixed point at some finite value of 0:. That this might happen in a non-Abelian 
gauge theory with a large enough number of matter fields was conjectured by Banks and 
Zaks [Banks and Zaks, 1982] and is known as the Banks-Zaks theory.

GeY the operator -b~nlnl)'I/; can be afely be ignored at low energy, but if A i lowered 
to 1 GeV this operator becomes extremely important. This language, although imprecise, 
actually is logical. It originates from the Wilsonian RG, as we will now explain. 
To begin, imagine that you have a theory with a physical short-distance cutoff AH , 
which is described by a Lagrangian with a finite or infinite set of operators Or of vari-
OUS mass dimensions r. For example, in a metal with atomic spacing ~ the physical cutoff 
would be AH rv ~-1 and the operators might include fr1J'!/J'/;J'I/;, where 'I/; correspond to 
H 
atoms. Let us write a general Lagrangian with cutoff AH as £(AH) = L Cr(AH) Air-r Or 
with Cr(AH) some dimensionless numbers. These numbers can be large and are probably 
impossible to compute. In principle they could all be measured, but we would need an 
infinite number ofrenormalization conditions for all the Cr(AH) to completely specify the 
theory. The key point, however, as we will show, is that not all the Cr(AH) are important 
for long-distance physics. 
At low energies, we do not need to take A to be as large as ~-1. As long as A is much 
larger than any energy scale of interest, we can perform loops as if A = 00 and cutoff-
dependent effects will be suppressed by powers of ff. (For example, for observables with 
E rv 100 GeV, you do not need A = 1019 GeV; A rv 1010 GeV works just as well.) So 
let us compute a different Lagrangian, £(A) = L Cr(A) A4- ror , with a cutoff A < AH, 
by demanding that physical quantities computed with the two Lagrangians be the same. 
With A = AL « AH, the coefficients Cr(AL) will be some other dimensionless numbers, 
which may be big or small, and which are (in principle) computable in terms of Cr(AH)' 
Now, if we are making large-distance measurements only, we should be able to work 
with £(AL) just as well as with £(AH)' So we might as well measure Cr(Ad to connect 
our theory to experiment. The important point, which follows from the Wilsonian RG, is 
that Cr(AL) is independent of Cr(AH) if r > 4. Since there will only be a finite number 
of operators in a given theory with mass dimension r <:::: 4, if we measure Cr <4(AL ) for 
these operators (as renormalization conditions), we can then calculate Cr >4(AL ) for all 
the other operators as functions of the Cr:sA(AL). An explicit example is given below. 
This result motivates the definition of relevant operators as those with T < 4 and irrel-
evant operators as those with r > 4. Operators with r = 4 are called marginal. We 
only need to specify renormalization conditions for the relevant and marginal operators, 
of which there are always a finite number. The Wilson coefficients for the irrelevant oper-
ators can be computed with very weak dependence on any boundary condition related to 
short-distance physics, that is, on the values of Cr(AH)' 
443 

444 
The renormalization group 
Thus, it is true that with A = AH or = AL the Lagrangian should have operator with 
coefficients determined by A to some power. Therefore irrelevant operator do get tno 
important as the cutoff is lowered. H wever, the important point is n t the ize of the te 
operators, but that their Wilson coefficients are computable. In other words: 
Se 
Values of couplings when the cutoff is low are insensitive to the boundary conditions 
associated with irrelevant operators when the cutoff is high. 
If we take the high cutoff to infinity then the irrelevant operators are precisely those" 
lOr 
which there is zero effect on the low-cutoff Lagrangian. Only relevant operators retnain 
when the cutoff is removed. So: 
The space of renormalizable field theories is the space for which the limit AH -; 00 
exists, holding the couplings fixed when the cutoff is AL . 
Another important point i that in the Wilsonian picture one does not want to take AL dOwn 
to phy ical cale of interest. One want. to lower A enough so that the irrelevant operators 
become in ensilive to boundary condition. , but then to leave it high enough so one can 
perfonn loop integral as if 
= 
. That i : 
The Wilsonian cutoff A should always be much larger than all relevant physical scales. 
This is in contrast to the J.L in the continuum picture, which should be taken equal to a 
relevant physical scale. 
For example, in the electroweak theory, one can imagine taking A = 100 TeV, not A = 
1019 OeV and not A = 1000eY. 
23.6.1 Wilson-Polchinski renormalization group equation 
To prove the above statements, we need to sort out what is being held fixed and what is 
changing. Since the theory is supposed to be finite with UV cutoff A, the path integral is 
finite (at least to a physicist), and all the physics is contained in the generating functional 
Z [J]. The ROE is then simply A di Z [J] = O. If we change the cutoff A, then the coupling 
constants in the Lagrangian must change to hold Z[J] constant. For example, in a scalar 
theory, we might have 
Z[J] = JAH D¢exp {i J d4x( -~¢(O + m2)¢ + ;~ ¢3 + ~~¢4 + ~~ ¢6 .. . + ¢J)} 
(23.110) 
for some cutoff AH on the momenta of the fields in the path integral. All the couplings, 
m, 93, 94 etc., are finite. If we change the cutoff to A then the couplings change to m', g~, gj 
etc., so that Z[J] is the same. 
Unfortunately, actually pelforming the path integral over a A-shell is extremely difficult 
to do in practice. A more efficient way to phrase the Wilsonian ROE in field theory was

The eo//\.2 factor makes the propagator go as e- p2 //\.2 ---+ 0 at high energy. You can get 
away with this only in a scalar theory in Euclidean space, but we will not let such tech-

Since he - ;::z only has support near p2 "" A 2 , the change in Lint comes from that momen-
tum region. Therefore, the ROE will be local in A. This is a general result, independent of 
the precise way the cutoff is imposed. It can also be used to define a functional differential 
equation known as the exact renormalization group (see Problem 23.7), which we will 
not make use of here. 
As a concrete example, consider a theory with a dimension-4 operator (with dimension-
less coupling g4) and a dimension-6 operator (with coupling g6 with mass dimension -2). 
Then the ROE Ad~ Z[J] = 0 would imply some equations that we can write as

It is not hard to solve the RGEs explicitly in the case when /34 and /36 are small. Actuali 
one does not need the fJi to be small; rather, one can start with an exact solution to t;' 
full RGEs and then expand perturbatively around the solution. For simplicity, we will jus~ 
assume that the fJi can be expanded in their arguments. To linear order, we can write 
(23.118) 
(23.119) 
and we assume a, b, c, d are small real numbers, so that the anomalous dimension does not 
overwhelm the classical dimension (otherwise perturbation theory would not be valid). It 
is now easy to solve this vector of homogeneous linear differential equations by changing 
to a diagonal basis:

As. As AH ---+ 00 the value of A6(A) goes to a constant value, entirely set by A4(A) and the 
anomalous dimensions. Arrows denote RG flow to decreasing A. Note the convergence is 
extremely quick. 
let us take >"'6 (AH) = 0 (any other boundary value would do just as well, but the solution 
is messier). Then, Eqs. (23.122) and (23.123) can be combined into 
(23.124) 
Setting A = AL « AH and assuming a, b, c, d « 2, so that 6. ~ 2, we find 
(23.125) 
In patticular, the limit AH ---> 00 exists. Back in terms of g4 and g6 we have fixed g4(AL ) 
and set g6(AH ) = O. Thus, as AH ---> 00 we have g6(AL ) = -L&-g4 (AL ). That is, the 
L 
boundary condition at large AH is totally irrelevant to the value of g6 at the low scale. That 
is why operators with dimension greater than 4 are called irrelevant. This result is shown 
in Figure 23.2. 
To relate all this rather abstract manipulation to physics, recall the calculation of the 
electron magnetic moment from Chapter 17. We ~ und lhal lhe moment was 9 = 2 at tree-
level and 9 = 2 + ~ al I-loop. If we had added to the QED Lagrangian an operator of the

with the cutoff set to some very high cale, say AN rv i'v1PI rv 1019 GeV. Then, when the 
Cutoff is lowered, even a little bit (say to 1015 Ge V), whatever you set your coefficient to at 
1I1pI would be totally irrelevant: the coefficient of 0 u would now be determined completely

Note that if we lowered the cutoff down to ay I MeV th n 00' would indeed g' 
a contribution to g, but a contribution ca1culabl entirely in term of a. With such a I~ve

cancel, since the theory is independent of cutoff. That i why one does n t want t take thY 
cutoff AL down to scales near physics of interest in the Wilsonian picture. To repeat, in the 
continuum picture, p, is of the order of physical scales, but in the Wilsonian picture 
A .e 
always much higher than all of the relevant physical scales. 
, It Is 
Returning to our toy RGEs, suppose we set A4(AH) = O. Then we would have found 
A,(A) ~ 
2+ ~ (of;; t] 
6 A6(A) 
2 + d - a - t:,. - (2 + d - a + t:,.) (A~) 
(23.126) 
Expanding this for a, b, c, d « 2 gives 
(23.127) 
which diverges as AH ~ oo! Thus, we cannot self-consistently hold the irrelevant 
couplings fixed at low energy and take the high-energy cutoff to infinity. 
The same would be true if we had a dimension 4 coupling (such as a gauge coupling) and 
a dimension-2 parameter, such as m 2 for a scalar. Then, we would have found an extraor-
dinary sensitivity of m 2(Ad to the boundary condition m2 (AH) if g(AL) is held fixed. 
Of course, like any renormalizable coupling, one should fix m 2(Ad through a low-energy 
experiment, for example measuring the Higgs mass. The Wilsonian RG simply implies that 
if there is a short-distance theory with cutoff AH in which mh is calculable, then mh(AH ) 
should have a very peculiar looking value. For example, suppose m(A£) = 10 GeV when 
AL = 105 GeV. Then, there is some value for m 2 (AH) with AH = 1019 GeV. If there 
were a different short-distance theory for which m 2(AH) were different by a factor of 
A2 
38 
. 
order # = 10-
,then m 2(A£) would differ by a factor of order 1 (see Problem 23.8). 
This is the fine-tuning problem. It is a sensitivity of long-distance measurements to small 
deformations of a theory defined at some short-distance scale. The general result is that 
relevant operators, such as scalar masses, are UV sensitive (unless they are protected by a 
custodial symmetry; see Section 22.6). 
23.6.2 Generalization and discussion 
The generalization of the above 2-operator example is a theory with an arbitrary set of 
operators On. To match onto the Wilson operator language (this is, after all, the Wilsonian 
RGE), let us write 
(23.128) 

23.6 Wilsonian renormalization group equation 
. ce there is a cutoff, all couplings (Wilson coefficients Cn) in the theory are finite. The 
~~B in the Wilsonian picture is Ad~ Z[J] = 0, which forces 
d 
A dA Cn = !1n( {Cm}, A) 
(23.129) 
for some !1n. In the continuum picture, the RGE we used was 
d 
J1. dJ1. Cn = 'YnmCm , 
(23.130) 
which looks a lot like the linear approximation to the Wilsonian RGE. In fact, we can 
linearize the Wilsonian RGE, not necessarily by requiring that all the couplings be small, 
bUt simply by expanding around a fixed point, which is a solution ofEq. (23.129) for which 
fin "" O. 
In the continuum language, although the cutoff is removed, the anomalous dimen-
sions 'Ymn are still determined by the UV divergences. So these two equations are very 
closely related. However, there is one very important difference: in the continuum picture 
quadratic and higher-order power-law divergences are exactly removed by counterterms. 
In the continuum picture of renormalization, the only UV divergences corresponding to 
physically observable effects are logarithmic ones (examples were given in various non-
renormalizable theories in Chapter 22). With a finite cutoff, one simply has A 2 terms in 
the ROE. This A 2 dependence was critical for the analysis of g4 and g6 in the previous 
subsection. 
For a theory with general, possibly non-perturbative !1n, consider a given subset S of 
the operators and its complement S. Choose coefficients for the operators in S to be fixed 
at a scale AL and set the coefficients for the operators in S to 0 at a scale AH . If it is 
possible to take the limit AH -7 00 so that all operators have finite coefficients at AL , 
the theory restricted to the set S is called a renormalizable theory. Actually, one does not 
have to set all the operators in S to 0 at AH ; if there is any way to choose their coefficients 
as a function of AH so that the theory at AL is finite, then the theory is still considered 
renormalizable. 
It is not hard to see that this definition coincides with the one we have been using 
all along. As you might imagine, generalizing the g4/ g6 example above, any operator 
with dimension greater than 4 will be non-renormalizable and irrelevant. Operators with 
dimension less than 4 are super-renormalizable and relevant. Marginal operators have 
dimension equal to 4; however, if the operator has any anomalous dimension at all it will 
become marginally relevant or marginally irrelevant. From the Wilsonian point of view, 
marginally irrelevant operators are the same as irrelevant ones - one cannot keep their 
Couplings fixed at low energy and remove the cutoff. 
Technically, the terms relevant and irrelevant should be applied only to operators cor-
responding to eigenvectors of the RG. Otherwise there is operator mixing. So, let us 
diagonalize the matrix ,mn and consider its eigenvalues. Any eigenvalue An of ,mn with 
An > 0 will will cause the couplings Cn to decrease as J1. is lowered. Thus, these operators 
decrease in importance at long distances. They are the irrelevant operators. Relevant oper-
ators have An < O. These operators increase in importance as J1. is lowered. If we try to 
take the long-distance limit, the relevant operators blow up. It is sometimes helpful to think

We have discussed the concept of unitarity a number of times now. Informally, unitarit 
means conservation of probability: something cannot be created from nothing, nOr ca~ 
something just disappear. Our insistence on unitarity constrains the states in the Hilben 
space to transform in unitary representations of the Poincare group. As we will see, this 
aspect of unitarity provides powerful constraints even if the set of states is not known 
exactly. (For example, we do not need to know the spectrum of bound states.) Unitarity 
also constrains the form that interactions can have, since the S-matrix must be unitary. 
In Chapter 8, we argued that particles should be identified with states in the Hilbert 
space that transform in unitary irreducible representations of the Poincare group. Single_ 
and multi-particle states are eigenstates of the momentum operator P/l' with P/lIX) =:: 
p/lIX) for a set of real numbers P/l with Po > 0 and p2 :::: 0, which transform in the 4-
vector representation of the Lorentz group. The corresponding adjoint states (XI satisfy 
(XIP/l = (Xlp/l for the same P/l.' Single-particle states IX) transform under irreducible 
unitary representations of the Lorentz group as well, as IX) ---7 exp( iB/lvS/lV) IX) where 
B /lV are the boost and rotation angles and S/lv are the generators of the Lorentz group in the 
representation of that particle. The transformations of a multi-particle state are induced by 
the transformations of the particles in that state. The vacuum In) is assumed to be Lorentz 
invariant and to have zero momentum: Pin) = O. 
An important feature of the Hilbert space is that it is complete, in the sense that 
1l = L J

(24.1) 
where the sum is over single- and multi-particle states IX) and 
(24.2) 
Up to an overall <5-function, this is the Lorentz-invariant phase space of the particles in state 
X, dIILIPs = (271/ 
<54 (I;p) dIIx . We verified the normalization of this completeness 
relation for one-particle states in Eq. (2.74); Eq. (24.1) is the natural generalization to 
multi-particle states. For the completeness relation to hold, all possible independent states 
in the theory must be included. As we will see, there is a close connection between unitarily 
of the S-matrix and having all the states included in the theory. 
We begin the discussion of implications of unitarity in Section 24.1 with the optical the-
orem. The optical theorem gives a powerful, non-perturbative relationship between cross 
sections and the imaginary part of scattering amplitudes. In perturbation theory, the optical

Section 24.2 discusses additional non-perturbative results for general field theories. We 
snow that one-particle states will always give poles in Green's functions . From this, a 
non-perturbative version of the LSZ reduction formula follows as a special case. Although 
naving states in a theory corresponding to every pole in Green's functions is a requirement 
of unitarity, unitary theories are not necessarily described by local Lagrangians. Some 
connections between locality and unitarity are discussed in Section 24.4. 
24.1 The optical theorem 
Unitarity is a fancy way of saying probabilities add up to 1. Conservation of probability in 
a quantum theory implies that, in the Schrodinger picture, the norm of a state I \If; t) is the 
same at any time t. For example, 
('II; tl\lf; t) = (\If; Ol\lf; 0) . 
(24.3) 
Now, since 
(24.4) 
unitarity means the Hamiltonian should be Hermitian, HT = H . Then, since the S-matrix 
is S = e-iHt , unitarity implies 
sts = 1. 
(24.5) 
That is, the S-matrix is a unitary matrix. Despite its apparent simplicity, this equation has 
remarkable consequences. 
One of the most important implications of unitarity is a relationship between scattering 
amplitudes and cross sections called (for historical reasons) the optical theorem. To derive 
the optical theorem, first recall from Chapter 5 that the S-matrix elements that we have 
been calculating with Feynman graphs were defined by 
(24.6) 
where the transfer matrix T is the non-trivial part of the S-matrix: 
S = 11. + iT. 
(24.7) 
The matrix T is not Hermitian. In fact, unitarity implies 1 = st S = (1 - iTt)(1 + iT) 
and so 
i (Tt - T) = TtT. 
(24.8) 
453

Implications of unitarity 
Sandwiching the left-hand side between UI and Ii) gives 
Uli (Tt - T) Ii) = i(i ITI J)* - i U ITli) 
= i(27r)4J4(Pi - Pj) (M*(f--->i) - M(i--->f)). 
(24.9) 
Using the completeness relation in Eq. (24.1), we get 
UITtTli) = L J 
dIIx UITt IX) (XITli) 
x 
= L(27r)4J4(p! - Px) (27r)4J4(Pi - px) J 
dIIxM (i--->X) M* (f--->X). 
(24.10) 
x 
Thus, unitarity implies: 
The generalized optical theorem 
This generalized optical theorem must hold order-by-order in perturbation theory. 
But while its left-hand side has matrix elements, the right-hand side has matrix ele-
ments squared. This means that at order .>-2 in some coupling the left-hand side must 
be a loop to match a tree-level calculation on the right-hand side. Thus, the imagi-
nary parts of loop amplitudes are determined by tree-level amplitudes. In particular, 
we must have loops - an interacting classical theory by itself, without loops, violates 
unitarity. 
An important special case of the generalized optical theorem is when Ii) = If) = IA) 
for some state A. Then, 
2iImM(A ---> A) = i L J 
dIIx (27r)4J4(PA - px)IM(A ---> X) 12.

In particular, when IA) is a one-particle state, the decay rate is 
So, 
ImM(A ---7 A) = mA L r(A ---> X) = mAr tot , 
X 
(24.11) 
(24.12) 
(24.13) 
where r tol is the total decay rate of a particle, equal to its inverse lifetime. This says that 
the imaginary part of the amplitude associated with the exact propagator is equal to mass 
times the total decay rate.

This special case is often called the optical theorem. It says that the imaginary part of the 
forward scattering amplitude is proportional to the total scattering cross section. 
24.1.1 Decay rates

To see the implications of Eq. (24.13), let us take as an example a simple theory with two 
scalar fields ¢ and 7r and Lagrangian 
£ = -~¢(D + M 2)¢ - ~7r(D + m 2)7r + ~¢7r2.

2 
(24.15) 
If !If > 2m then ¢ can decay into 7r7r. Then Eq. (24.13) implies 
ImM (¢ --+ ¢) = Mr (¢ --+ 7r7r) + other decay modes. 
(24.16) 
We will now verify this at order A 2 .

Now, x(1 - x) ::; ~, so for M < 2m this expression is real, and therefore ImM loop = O. 
In this regime the decay rate is also zero, so Eq. (24.16) holds for M < 2m. 
For M > 2m we use 
In( -A - if:) = InA - i7r.

The term with ITR(k - p)ITR(k) in it only has poles above the real ko axis. Thus, we can 
close the ko integration contour in the lower half-plane and the integral gives zero. Also, 
the two o-functions can never be simultaneously satisfied (this is easiest to see in the frame 
where if = 0 so that Po = M and Wk-p = Wk). Dropping such terms, we can use Eq.

This equation indicates that the imaginary part of the amplitude can be calculated by 
putting intermediate particles on-shell. 
It turns out the above manipulations can be performed for any amplitude. The generaliza_ 
tion of Eq. (24.33) is an efficient shortcut to calculating imaginary parts ofloop amplitudes 
known as the cutting rules. These rules are given in Box 24.3. Each way of putting inter-
mediate states in a loop amplitude on-shell is known as a cut. Cut diagrams are often drawn 
as 
with the dashed line indicating that the particles in the loop intersecting the cut are to be 
put on-shell. Cuts are directional, in the sense that cut particles should have positive energy 
when flowing from the left to the right side of the diagrams. You can explore another way 
to derive the cutting rules in Problem 24.1. An excellent discussion of the cutting rules can 
be found in [Veltman, 1994]. 
As an example, one can use the cutting rules to directly confirm the optical theorem.

24.1 The optical theorem 
. aoreement with Eg. (24.16). 
ill The discontinuity of an amplitude considered as a complex function of momenta is given 
the cutting ruJ . [ utkosky, 1960]. The discontinuity of an amplitude means the differ-
b~ce between the amplitude when the energies are given small positive imaginary parts or 
ell1aJll1cgative imaginary parts. That is, 
Disc iM (pO) == iM(pO + it:) - iM(pO - it:) = - 2ImM(pO). 
(24.37) 
Amusingly, the word cut refers simultaneously to the procedure of slicing open loops to 
form trees, to branch cut singularities associated with particle thresholds producing the dis-
continuity, and to Cutkosky's name. The analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex 
plane is a fascinating and important subject (see for example [Eden et aI., 1966]). 
By the way, you may have noticed in Eg. (24.30) that the entire loop amplitude was 
given by a sum of terms with a-functions, not just its imaginary part. In fact, one can 
perform similar substitutions for any loop amplitude, replacing all the propagators with 
UF = I1R + a and dropping all the terms with only I1R . For the remaining terms, one 
can substitute back in IIR = I1F - a to produce a set of terms with Feynman propagators, 
each one of which has at least one a-function. In this way, loops can be decomposed into 
tree amplitudes. That this can always be done is known as the Feynman tree theorem 
[Feynman, 1972]. Essentially, the Feynman tree theorem reduces Lorentz-covariant time-
dependent perturbation theory to old-fashioned perturbation theory (see Chapter 4), which 
is formulated in terms of on-shell intermediate states from the start. In fact, one of the 
simplest ways to prove the generalized optical theorem for a given theory, and hence that 
the theory is unitary, is using old-fashioned perturbation theory (see, for example [Sterman 
1993, Section 9.6]). 
24.1.3 Propagators and polarization sums 
The optical theorem and the cutting rules work for particles of any spin. For particles with 
spin, one must sum over final state spins in the decay rate. In fact, the optical theorem 
efficiently connects propagators to spin sums, as we now explain. 
For example, take Yukawa theory with Lagrangian 
£ = -~ ¢(D + M2)¢ + -J;(if/J - m)'ljJ + ).,¢-J;'ljJ.

(24.41) 
For the imaginary part of M loop, we have to put the intermediate states on-shell. This 
replaces the propagators by -27ri times a-functions, just as for the scalar case. The nUmer_ 
ator factor is unaffected, and stays as Tt[ (q-i - m) (0/2 + m)]. Thus, the cut loop amplitude 
gives 2]0.,1 times the decay rate, which is twice the imaginary part, as expected. 
Note, however, that the Tt[(¢ - m)(q6 + m)] factor in the decay rate came from a sum 
over physical on-shell final states, while this factor in the loop came from the numerators 
of the propagators. Thus, for the optical theorem to hold in general: 
The numerator of a propagator must be equal to the sum over physical spin states. 
This is a consequence of unitarity. 
As a check, for a massive spin-l field, the spin sum is (see Problem 8.5) 
(24.42) 
and the propagator is

(24.43) 
So the numerator is again given by the sum over physical spin states and the optical theorem 
holds. 
What about a massless spin-l field? There, the spin sum includes only transverse polar-
izations. There is no way to write the sum in a Lorentz-invariant way, but we can write 
it as 
where j5{L = (E, -if) (see Section 13.5.1). The photon propagator is

Unitarity for massless spin-I fields requires gauge invariance.

24.1.4 Unstable particles 
------------------------------------------------------------------
In Chapter 18 we showed that after summing all the IPI insertions the full propagator in 
the interacting theory becomes (Eq. (18.37) for a scalar) 
(24.47) 
where iE(p2) is defined as the sum of IPI self-energy graphs and mR is whatever renor-
Olalized rna 
appears in the Lagrangian (e.g. mn. i Ule M rna s). The pole mass mp was 
defined so that G(p2) ha a pole atp2 = m~, which led to m~ - mk + E (m~) = o. 
[f Ule particle i un. table, then E(p2) will in general have an imaginary part, and the 
definilion of pole mas need to be modi'fied. 11

(24.48) 
where the ·· · refer to non-IPI diagrams. If we assume that r tot « m p , as in a weakly 
coupled theory, then these additional contributions will be suppressed by additional factors 
of some couplings and can be ignored. Thus, ImE( m~) = m pr tot, which is non-zero for 
unstable particles. 
A natural way to keep the mass real is to modify the definition of pole mass so that 
m~ - m~ + ReE(m~) = o. 
(24.49) 
This new definition is sometimes called the real pole mass or the Breit-Wigner mass. By 
Eq. (24.48), near the pole the propagator has the form

From left to right, the Breit-Wigner distributions for r Imp = 50%, 10% and 1%.

(24.51) 
This is known as a Breit-Wigner distribution. It is the characteristic shape of a res-
onance. Examples are shown in Figure 24.1. The full-width at half-maximum of the 
Breit-Wigner distribution is 2mpf tot. This is why we use the words width and decay 
rate interchangeably. 
Note also that we can justify treating ~(p2) as constant when f tot « mp, since then 
the cross section only has support for p2 ~ m ~. In the f tot -7 0 limit, we can treat the 
cross section as a o-function with coefficient given by the integral over the Breit-Wigner 
distribution: 
r « mp. 
(24.52) 
This is called the narrow-width approximation. It says that near a resonance we can treat 
the resonant particle as being on-shell. In the narrow-width approximation, the production 
and decay of the resonance can be treated separately - there can be no interference between 
production and decay. For example,

P I consequence of unitarilY with other important implications, to be discussed further 
el"8-
. Section 24.3. 
In Another impllcau n of the narrow-width approximation is that cross sections can be 
calculated as production rates. For example, consider the process e+ e-
--; Z --; Dv in 
siIllplified model where the Z is a vector boson of mass mz that couples only to the 
:lectrOn, e- , and the neutrino, v, with strength g. At center-of-mass energies ECM « 
rnz, the total cross section for this process is proportional to g4. However, for ECM rv 
rnz, there is resonant enhancement and (J is proportional only to g2. Indeed, the total 
decay rate r of the Z is proportional to l (since r rv Im( i~) rv g2) and thus a factor 
2 
of l cancels near resonance, (J rv g4 ':rJ(p2 - m 2) rv ~J(p2 - m2). To exploit this 
resonance enhancement, from 1989 to 1996 the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at 
CERN collided electrons at the Z-pole (ECM = 91 GeV). Running at the Z-pole greatly 
enhanced the production rate of Z's and allowed for precision tests of the Standard Model. 
To compare this LEP data to theory predictions, the narrow-width approximation works 
excellently, and one can completely ignore Z lr interference. At higher center-of-mass 
energies, at which LEP ran from 1998 to 2000, Z lr interference is important and must be 
included. 
When r lol ;::: mp, there is no natural definition for the mass of a particle. For example, 
in a strongly coupled theory the decay rate becomes large as do both the real and imaginary 
parts of ~ (p2). A particle decaying very fast relative to its mass cannot be reliably iden-
tified as a particle. Examples include certain bound states in pure QCD called glueballs. 
These decay as fast as they are formed and do not form sharp resonances. Identifying a 
resonance with a particle only makes sense when r tot < mp. 
There are alternatives to the real pole mass. An obvious one is the complex pole mass, 
me, defined by mb - m~ + ~(mb) = O. A much more important mass definition is 
the M8 mass, mR, discussed in Section 18.4. The M8 mass is not defined by any pole 
prescription. Instead, it is a renormalized quantity which must be extracted from scattering 
processes that depend on it. Recall from Chapter 18 that a mass definition is equivalent to 
a subtraction scheme that is a prescription for determining the finite parts of counterterms. 
For the M8 mass, one simply sets the finite parts of the counterterms to zero. The 118 mass 
can be converted to the pole mass using Eq. (24.49). M8 masses are particularly useful for 
particles that do not form asymptotic states and cannot be identified as resonances, such 
as quarks. For example, there is no way to extract the bottom-quark mass from a Breit-
Wigner distribution. M8 masses are also important for precision physics, as we will see in 
Chapter 31. 
24.1.5 Partial wave unitarity bounds 
Another important implication of the optical theorem is that scattering amplitudes cannot 
be arbitrarily large. That unitarity bounds should exist follows from conservation of proba-
bility: what comes out should not be more than what goes in. Roughly speaking, the optical

a different bound, called the partial wave unitarity b lIJld. · .11 
Consider 2 -+ 2 elastic scattering of two particles A and B in the center-of-mass fra 
A(pd + B(P2) -+ A(P3) + B(p4). The total cross section for this process in the cen~e: 
of-mass frame is (integrating the general formula in Eq. (5.32) over d¢) 
er. 
O"tot(AB -+ AB) =

jdcOS(1IM ((1)1 2 . 
327TEcM 
(24.54) 
To derive a useful bound, it is helpful to decompose the amplitude into partial waves. We 
can always write 
00 
M((1) = 167T Laj (2j + l )Pj (cos(1), 
j=O 
where Pj (cos (1) are the Legendre polynomials that satisfy Pj (1) = 1 and 
1

Thus, we can perform the cos (1 integral in Eq. (24.54) to get

0" tot = E2 L..t (2) + 1) lajl . 
CM j=O 
(24.55) 
(24.56) 
(24.57) 
Now, the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, 
at (1 = 0, to the total cross section: 
ImM(AB-+AB at B = 0) = 2EcMlPiI L O"tot(AB-+X) 
x 
2:: 2EcM lpiIO"tot(AB-+AB), 
(24.58) 
and therefore 
(24.59) 
Since lajl 2:: Im(aj), this equation says that lajl cannot be arbitrarily large. This is 
an example of a partial wave unitarity bound. The sum on j can in fact be dropped 
by considering scattering of angular momentum eigenstates rather than plane waves (see 
[Itzykson and Zuber, 1980, Section 5.3]). 
To get a cleaner-looking bound, consider the case when the total cross section is well 
approximated by the elastic cross section; that is, when the only relevant final state is the 
same as the initial one, in which case the inequality becomes an equality. Moreover, let 
us take the high-energy limit, ECM » mA, mE, so that masses can be neglected and 
IPiI = ~ECM' Then Eq. (24.59) becomes 
Im(aj) = lajl2.

This equation is solved by a circle in the complex plane, as in Figure 24.2. It implies 
and 
(24.61) 
for all j. These bounds actually follow more generally, without having to assume the elastic 
scattering cross section dominates, but the complete derivation is more involved, requir-
ing angular momentum conservation of the S-matrix, which depends on the spins of the 
particles involved (see Problem 24.3). 
The partial wave unitary bound provides extremely important limitations on the behav-
ior of scattering amplitudes. For example, suppose we have a theory with a dimension-5 
interaction, such as 
(24.62) 
The s-channel exchange diagram gives 
(24.63) 
This has no angular dependence, so laol = 16:A2 and aj = 0 for j > O. Thus, this 
amplitude violates the unitarity bound for ECM > V161T" A (including the t- and u-channels 
does not change this bound by much). That does not mean this theory is not unitarity, but 
that this diagram cannot represent the physics of this process for ECI,! > V 161T" A. Of 
course, we already knew that because this is a non-renormalizable theory loops should 
become important around the scale A. The perturbative unitarity bound implies that loops 
must be important around the scale A. 
For a more physical example, the perturbative unitary bound would be violated by the 
Scattering of longitudinal TV bosons in the Standard Model if there were no Higgs boson. 
Due to the JL dependence of the longitudinal polarization of the TV boson, the amplitude

24.2 Spectral decomposition 
Fields are a crucial ingredient of quantum field theory. In a free theory (or an interactin 
theory at any fixed time) we have constructed a set of fields out of creation and annihilatio~ 
operators that add or remove particles from states in the Hilbert space. Constructing fields 
out of creation and annihilation operators has a number of advantages: it smoothly connects 
classical field theory and quantum mechanics; it leads naturally to a well-defined perturba_ 
tion expansion; and it guarantees that the cluster decomposition principle holds. I However, 
one can also consider a generalized notion of fields that is not necessarily connected to 
creation and annihilation operators. 
A field ¢( x) is an operator acting on the Hilbert space which is a function of space-time. 
Certain fields are associated with particles, meaning they have non-zero matrix elements 
with some single-particle states: 
(24.64) 
where Ip) is some one-particle state with momentum pM and In) is the vacuum. The nor-
malization N is a number. A special case is fields ¢(x) that are the renormalized interacting 
fields constructed out of creation and annihilation operators for which N = 1 by construc-
tion. Another special case is the bare fields ¢o (x) appearing in a bare Lagrangian, related to 
the renormalized fields by ¢o(x) = viz¢(x), where Z is the field strength renormalization. 
For these, N = viz. Another example, which will play an important role in Chapter 28, is 
the pions, which are composite particles of mass m7r '" 140 MeV. The neutral pion state 
11T'°) has a non-zero matrix element with the current J M5(x) = ij;(XhM151(J(X). Explicitly, 
(nIJ~(x)I1T'°(p)) = i eipxPMF7r with F7f = 92 MeV (up to some isospin factors that we are 
ignoring). 
Equation (24.64) does not care if the fields are elementary, meaning they appear in a 
Lagrangian, or composite, like the pions which are made of quarks. Indeed, going back-
and-fOlth between elementary and composite notation is the idea behind effective field 
theory, a powerful technique which will play an important role in Parts IV and V. In this 
section, we show how one can understand the existence of particles as poles in Green's 
functions without using creation and annihilation operators.

function is non-negative has important implications, as we will see. 
The two-point function can then be written as

(see Problem 24.2). 
The spectral density has a lot of information in it. Basically, it tells us about all the 
on-shell intermediate states in the theory. It is observable (in principle) since it is just

(24.76) 
As we have already observed, in a unitary theory II(p2) can have an imaginary part 
only when cuts can put intermediate particles on-shell. Thus, the spectral density con-
tains information about the particles in the theory. In particular, it can tell us about these 
particles regardless of whether there are fundamental fields corresponding to them in the 
Lagrangian. 
As an example, recall the Lagrangian in Eq. (24.15), which describes a scalar ¢ of mass 
M interacting with a scalar 1f of mass m, with interaction ~¢1f2. In this case, II(p2) has 
an imaginary part at p2 = j\;j2 (from Eq. (24.25)). This is an isolated pole. For p2 > 4m2 
(above the ¢ ----) 1f1f threshold) there is an additional imaginary part. To be explicit, using 
Eqs. (24.20) and (24.47) we have

This is typical of spectral functions: it has a pole at one-particle states (and possible bound 
states) and then a branch-cut singularity above the multi-particle threshold. Note that the 
coefficient of 0 (q2 - A12) is 1 only when we use on-shell renormalization. Otherwise, it 
is given by the residue of the pole in the II(p2) at the pole mass p2 = m'j" which is 
subtraction-scheme dependent. 
The spectral representation gives powerful non-perturbative constraints. For example, 
suppose we tried to define a UV-finite quantum field theory by writing the Lagrangian for 
a scalar field as 
(24.78)

itivity of p (q2), which follows from Eq. (24.67), was critical for this bound. The conclusion 
is: 
Propagators cannot decrease faster than ~ at large p2. 
This is a very powerful, general non-perturbative result. 
24.2.2 Spectral decomposition for bare fields 
Up to this point, ¢( x) has been referring to the renormalized field. However, all the deriva-
tions in this section work equally well for a bare field ¢o (x), since all we have used is that 
the fields have unitary transformations under the Poincare group. For a general quantum 
field theory, the bare fields ¢o (x) are infinite and meaningless. However, once the theory 
has been regulated (or if it is finite or conformal), then we can legitimately talk about 
cOlTelation functions of bare fields, calculated from some bare Lagrangian. 
For bare fields, let us write the spectral decomposition as 
(niT {¢o(x)¢o(y)} In) = J (2d4p

One can derive an important normalization condition on the spectral function for bare

To derive this, first observe that by taking a time derivative of Eg. (24.69) we find 
(24.83) 

24.3 Polology 
~------------------------------------------
(t,x). Next recall the canonical commutation relation among the bare free 
(24.84) 
We derived this relation for the free theory in Section 2.3.3, and used it as a specification of 
tbe dynamics for interacting theories in Section 7.1. Setting x' = 0 and t' = 0, this relation 
il11plies that 
~ib3(X) = at (nl [¢o(x), ¢o(O)lln) It=o = at 1

= - i53(x) 1
00 
dq2pO(l) , 
(24.85) 
from which Eq. (24.82) follows. 
The importance of Eq. (24.82) is that it constrains the form of the divergences that can 
appear. For example, recall that the bare fields are related to the renormalized fields by 
~o(x) = VZ¢(x). In the on-shell scheme, 
iZ 
(nIT{¢o(x)¢o(y)}ln) = 
2 
2 +' . 
(24.86) 
P - m p 
u,; 
Thus PO(p2) = ZO(p2 - m'J,) + PO(p2) as in Eq. (24.77), where PO(p2) is everything 
beyond the pole and, like PO(p2), is positive. Thus, the normalization condition implies 
(24.87) 
which then implies 0 ~ Z ~ 1. 
As an example, we computed Z = Z2 for QED in Chapter 18, finding 
a (1

where A is the Pauli-Villars mass and m')' is an IR regulator. Clearly, Z2 is not between 0 
and 1 as m')' ---- O. Unfortunately, the only conclusion we can really draw from tlris is that 
Z2 cannot be computed in perturbation theory, even in a finite theory. This is, of course, 
not a problem, since Z2 is not measurable. 
24.3 Polology 
The spectral decomposition also has non-trivial implications for arbitrary scattering ampli-
tudes. In particular, it will let us associate poles in the S-matrix with on-shell intermediate 
states. This proof follows [Weinberg, 1995, Section 10.2]. 
Consider the momentum space Green's function: 
Gn (Pl, .. . , Pn) = J 
d4xl eiPIXl ... J 
d4xne- iPnxn (n IT {¢(Xl) . .. ¢(xn)} In).

(\11' if>( '1)' .. if> (:I;,. ) In) i= 0 then G will have a pole at p = m and the Green's funct' tan 
will factorize near the pole. 
To prove this, we first write 
(OIT{¢(xd'" ¢(xn)}IO) 
= 8 1r(0IT{ ¢(xd ... ¢(X,.)) T{ ¢(xr+d . .. ¢(xn)} IO) + extra, 
(24.90) 
where 
(24.91) 
puts the two subsets in time order and "extra" refers to the other time orderings. We have 
dropped the subscripts on the fields for conciseness. 
Next, we insert a complete set of states. The sum time-ordered product can then be 
written as 
The complete set of states sums over all one- and multi-particle states, but we are only 
exhibiting one term from this sum - the one involving the one-particle state Iw) of mass 
m. Other one-particle states and all the multi-particle states in the sum are in the "extra" 
part. 
Now, inserting momentum operators, as in Eq. (24.66), we can write 
(DIT{¢(Xl)'" ¢(xr)}lw ) 
= e- iPWXl (01 T{ e-iFxl¢(xdeiFXl e-iFX1 ¢(X2)'" ¢(Xr)eiFx1 } Iw)

where we have defined xj == Xj - Xl for j :::; r. Similarly, 
(wIT{¢(xr+d " ·¢(xn)}ID) = eiPwx"+l( wIT{¢( O) ¢(X~+2)" ·¢ (x~)}ID), 
(24.94) 
with xj = Xj - Xr+1 for j > r. Then, changing variables on all but Xl and Xr+l, we have

where "extra" refers to anything else that contributes. This equation says that Green's 
functions always have poles when on-shell intermediate particles can be produced. For 
example, positronium (an e+ e- bound state) would appear as a pole in a Green's function 
con-esponding to e+ e- scattering. 
In deriving Eq. (24.105), the only thing we used was that the state Iw) is a one-particle 
state with overlap with the state with r fields ¢l ... ¢r. We never needed to associate W 
with a field in a Lagrangian. This formula does not distinguish elementary particles (those 
with con-esponding fields in a Lagrangian) from composite particles. All that is needed is 
that the particle transforms in an in-educible representation of the Poincare group, so that 
it has some on-shell momentum pI-' with p2 = m 2 . 
In fact, we never even used the fact that the fields ¢(x) each have non-vanishing matrix 
elements in one-particle states. Equation (24.105) holds even if the fields ¢i (x) are generic 
operators Oi (x), as long as the product 0 1 (Xl) ... Or (xr ) still has a non-zero matrix ele-
ment between the vacuum (01 and some one-particle state Iw). Now suppose thatthe ¢i(X) 
do con-espond to elementary fields. In fact, suppose they are the renormalized fields that 
satisfy 
(24.106) 
where Ip) is the one-particle state con-esponding to the field ¢. Then there will be a pole 
in the Green's function even for r = 1. For r = 1, the pole occurs when the momentuI11

11 11. This is exactly what we expect from the LSZ reduction formula, but now it has 
on- . 
been proven non-perlurbatively. 
Another important implication of Eq. (24. 105) is that massless spin-l particles that inter-
t with each other must transform in the adjoint representation of a non-Abelian gauge 
aC 
roup, If this were not true, that is, if the couplings among the particles did not satisfy 
~e Jacobi identity, Eq. (24.105) would be violated. We prove this in Chapter 27. See also 
problem 9.3. 
24.4 Local ity 
We have seen that we do not need to have fields in the Lagrangian corresponding to every 
particle. Green's functions will always have poles at the mass of any particle that has 
non-zero overlap with some subset of the fields in the Green's functions. However, if one 
wants to calculate S-matrix elements involving some particle, it is extremely helpful to 
have an associated field. In fact, it is often extremely useful to go from one description in 
which a pole is emergent as a bound state to a description in which that bound state has 
a corresponding field. For example, we go from a theory (QCD) in which a pion is a pole 
in a Green's function to a theory (the Chiral Lagrangian) with a field cOlTesponding to the 
pion. The two descriptions have their own Lagrangians. The QCD Lagrangian is useful for 
calculating the pion mass, while the Chiral Lagrangian is useful if one wants to calculate 
the 7r7r ----t 7r7r cross section, taking the pion mass from data. A great virtue of quantum 
field theory is its flexibility: one can use different Lagrangians for different processes. A 
number of examples of effective field theories, such as the Chiral Lagrangian, were given 
in Chapter 22. More will be discussed in Parts IV and V. 
There is an interesting connection between the emergence of particles as poles in Green's 
functions and locality. Informally, locality means that physics over here is independent of 
physics over there - we do not have to have the wavefunction of the universe to see what 
happens in our lab. However, defining locality in terms of observables is not straightfor-
ward - there are a number of different definitions we can give. For example, we could 
identify locality with the cluster decomposition principle (mentioned in Section 7.3.2), 
which requires the connected S-matrix not to be more singular than having poles or 
branch cuts (see [Weinberg, 1995, Chapter 4]). Alternatively, we could associate local-
ity with commutators vanishing outside the light cone (a property we called causality in 
Chapter 12). There are many related ways to define locality. 
To be concrete, we will define locality in terms of a Lagrangian. We take locality to mean 
that the Lagrangian is an integral over a Lagrangian density that is a fUllctional of fields and 
their derivatives evaluated at the same space-time point. For example, a Lagrangian term 
SUch as ¢O¢ is local by this definition, but a term such as ¢ 6 ¢ is not. To be clear, this 
475

Implications of unitarity 
definition is mathematical, not physical: it is a property of our calculational fralllew 
not of observables. Nevertheless, it has interesting consequences.

This is a very similar procedure to how we integrate out the Wand Z bosons to derive the 
4-Fermi theory (discussed already in Chapter 22 and an impOltant theme for Part IV). Now, 
both .c non-local and .c local appear to describe exactly the same theory, but one appears nOll-
local and the other local. Thus, our definition of locality, no negative powers of derivatives 
in the Lagrangian, already appears ambiguous. 
What goes wrong with the apparently local (but really non-local) Lagrangian, .c local? At 
energies p2 rv M2 we will see the apparent pole where the ¢ particle should have been, but 
had been integrated out. If the particle ¢ has really been removed from the Hilbert space 
when we integrated it out, unitarity would be violated. Indeed, the pole would give a non-
vanishing imaginary part to an appropriate amplitude, but there would be no corresponding 
on-shell state so the optical theorem would be violated. Thus, the non-local theory suggests 
that one should use a different effective description for energies greater than 1\11 in which 
the particle in the Hilbert space corresponding to the pole (present even in .c local) is given 
its own field.

boson. The non-locality tells us that an on-shell state is missing.

THE STANDARD 
MODEL 


So far, the only massless spin-l particle we have considered is the photon of QED. Yang-
Mills theories are a generalization of QED with multiple massless spin-l particles that 
can interact among themselves. Just as the Lagrangian description of QED is strongly con-
strained by gauge invariance, Lagrangians for Yang-Mills theories are strongly constrained 
by a generalization called non-Abelian gauge invariance. You already derived a number of 
these constraints by considering the soft limit in Problem 9.3. In this chapter we begin a 
systematic study of Yang-Mills theories. 
To begin, we review how the QED Lagrangian was determined. In Chapter 8 we saw that 
to write down a local Lagrangian for a massless spin-l particle, whose irreducible repre-
sentation of the Poincare group has two degrees of freedom, we had to embed the particle 
in a vector field AJL (x), which has four degrees of freedom. The two extra degrees of free-
dom in AJL(x) are removed in quantum field theory through gauge invariance. The gauge 
symmetry AJL(x) -; AJ.t(x) + ~aJ.ta(x) identifies the photon with an equivalence class of 
vector fields. The kinetic Lagrangian invariant under this symmetry is unique: [ = - i F;v 
with FJ.tv = aJLAv - avAI-" This kinetic Lagrangian propagates two degrees of freedom, 
as required for an irreducible unitary representation of a massless spin-l particle. To have 
the photon interact with matter, the interactions have to preserve the gauge symmetry. 
We found that an easy way to determine gauge-invariant interactions is with the covariant 
derivative DJL1/J = (aJL - iQeAJ.t)1/J. For example, replacing al" -; DJ.t in the fermionic 
kinetic term ,(iryJL a",1/J gives 1iJ"('" D",1/J, which is gauge invariant under the transformation 
1/J(x) -; eiQo:(x)1/J(x). In fact, 1iJ"(J.t DJ.t1/J contains the unique renormalizable interaction 
we can write down in QED. Yang-Mills theories are the unique generalizations of QED in 
which renormalizable self-interactions among massless spin-l particles are possible. 
We begin our study of Yang-Mills theories with an example. Suppose we have two fields 
¢l and ¢2. Then the kinetic Lagrangian 
(25.1) 
where ¢ = (¢1,¢2f, is invariant under a global SU(2) symmetry, ¢ -; U¢, with U a 
special unitary 2 x 2 matrix.! In general, such a U can always be written as 
I This Lagrangian is actually invariant under a larger U(2) = U(l) x SU(2) symmetry. But, as we will come 
to understand, there is no point in considering non-simple groups such as U(N) in quantum field theory. 
For example, in a gauge theory the coupling constants for the U(l) and SU(2) subgroups will in general be 
different; even if we set them equal at one scale, they will run differently. Moreover, the U (I) symmetry in 
Lagrangians such as Eq. (25.1) will often be violated by a quantum effect called an anomaly, to be discussed 
in Chapter 30. Thus, we will restrict attention to the simple SU(N) subgroups.

Yang-Mills theory 
(25.2) 
where T a = ~aa and aa are the Pauli sigma matrices (see Eq. (10.3)) and aa are real nu 
bers. The normalization of the T a matrices is chosen so that [Ta , TbJ = iEabcTc. Here "'~-
'" c 
is the Levi-Civita tensor (the totally antisymmetric tensor with E123 = 1). Infinitesill1al! y, 
¢ -+ ¢ + iaaTa¢. 
(25.3) 
We can promote the global 8U(2) symmetry to a local symmetry by elevating the r 
numbers aa to real functions of space-time aa (x). To make the kinetic terms invari:~l 
under the local symmetry, we can elevate the ordinary derivatives to covariant derivative: 
defined by 
(25.4) 
where 9 is a number (the strength of the force) and A~ are a set of three gauge bosons 
which transform as 
' 
(25.5) 
where r bc = 
Eabc are the structure constants for 8U(2). The unique gauge-invariant 
kinetic term for the A~ is 
LYM = - ~ 2::= (8I"A~ - 8vA~ + grbc A~A~)2 . 
(25.6) 
a 
You should check (Problem 25.1) that Lkin with 81" -+ DI" and .cYM are gauge invariant. 
This gauge symmetry is called non-Abelian because the group generators T a do not com-
mute with each other. Yang-Mills theories are also known as non-Abelian gauge theories. 
In Section 25.2 we wj[[ see why the form of Eq. (25.6) is natural from a geometric point 
of view. 
Note that the kinetic term in Eq. (25.6) includes renormalizable interactions among the 
three gauge bosons for 8U(2). These interactions are very important. For example, as we 
will see in Chapter 26, virtual gauge bosons produce a vacuum polarization effect with 
the opposite sign from virtual spinors or scalars. Thus, in contrast to QED where the fine-
structure constant was logarithmically weaker at larger distances, coupling constants in 
Yang-Mills theories can get logarithmically stronger at larger distances. This property of 
Yang-Mills theories explains qualitative features of the strong force, such as why quarks 
act as essentially free within a nucleus yet can never escape. In the next few chapters, we 
will study the fascinating physics of Yang-Mills theories. 
25.1 Lie groups 
We have already seen a few examples of Lie groups: the 3D rotation group 80(3), the 
Pauli spin group 8U(2) and the Lorentz group 0(1,3). The Lie group associated with 
QED, whose elements are phases eio: with 0 ::; a < 27f, is called U(l). This section 

25.1 Lie groups 
~--------------------------------------------
rovides a summary of some of the relevant mathematics of group theory (see also the 
p 
.' S 
. 
10 
discussIon III ectlOn 
.1). 
Lie groups are groups with infinite numbers of elements that are also differentiable man-
'folds. All groups have an identity element :n.. Any group element continuously connected 
~o the identity can be written as 
(25.7) 
where ea are numbers parametrizing the group elements and T a are called the group gen-
erators. Given any explicit form of the elements U of a Lie group, you can always figure 
out what the T a are by expanding in a small neighborhood of]. We performed this exercise 
for the Lorentz group, 0(1, 3), in Chapter 10. 
The generators of a Lie group Ta form a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra is defined through 
its commutation relations: 
(25.8) 
where r bc are known as structure constants. A Lie group is Abelian if r bc = 0 and 
non-Abelian otherwise. For example, the algebra 8u(2) associated with the non-Abelian 
group SU(2) has r be = cabe . 
Note that we are calling Eq. (25.8) a commutation relation, but really it is just a map-
ping 9 x 9 ~ 9. This mapping is more generally called a Lie bracket. By calling it a 
COimnutator, we are implying that it can be represented as 
[A , B] = AB - BA. 
(25.9) 
Such notation implies, in addition to the Lie bracket mapping, that products of elements 
are well defined. When this holds, then [A, [B, Cll = ABC - ACB - BCA + CBA and 
it automatically follows that 
[A, [B, Cll + [B , [C, All + [C, [A, Bll = o. 
(25.10) 
This last equation is known as the Jacobi identity. In terms of the structure constants, the 
Jacobi identity can be written as 
(25.11) 
The formal definition of a Lie algebra does not require that we write [A, B] = AB - BA, 
but it does require that the Jacobi identity holds. The Jacobi identity is formally defined 
only using the Lie bracket, and not through products. This is really just a technical math-
ematical point - in all the cases with physics applications, the generators are embedded 
into matrices and the Lie bracket can be defined as a commutator, so the Jacobi identity is 
automatically satisfied. 
An ideal is a subalgebra Ie 9 satisfying [g, i] c I for any 9 E 9 and i E I. A simple 
Lie algebra has no non-trivial ideals. Important simple Lie algebras are su(N) and so(N). 
The Standard Model is based on the gauge group SU(3) ® SU(2) ® U(l) whose Lie alge-
bra is 8u(3) EB 8u(2) EB u(l). The Standard Model Lie algebra is semisimple, meaning it is 
the direct sum of simple Lie algebras. A theorem that explains the importance of semisim-
pie Lie algebras in physics states that all finite-dimensional representations of semisimple 
483 

484 
Yang-Mills theory 
algebra are Hcnnitian (see Problem 25.3). Hence, one can con CrueL unitary theories base 
on semisimple algebra . There can be an infinite or finite n'Umber of generator r a fOr th d 
Lie rug bra. If there are a finite number, the algebra and the group it generates are said t e 
be finite dimensional. 
0 
Unitary groups can be defined as preserving a complex inner product: 
(25.12) 
That is, UtU = 1l. Elements of special unitary groups also have det(U) = 1. The grou 
SU(N) is defined by its action on N-dimensional vector spaces. In the defining repre~ 
sentation, group elements can be written as U = exp(iBara), where r a is a Hermitian 
matrix. There are N 2 -
1 generators for SU(N), so we say the dimension of the group 
d(G) = N 2 -1 forG = SU(N). 
The orthogonal groups preserve a real inner product: 
V· W = v· aT . a . w. 
(25.13) 
So, aTa = 1l. For these d(O(N)) = ~N(N - 1). Every orthogonal matrix has deter-
minant ± 1. Those with determinant 1 are elements of the special orthogonal group. The 
dimensions of O(N) and SO(N) are the same. 
Other finite-dimensional simple Lie groups include the symplectic groups, Sp(N), 
which are the next step in the generalization from a real to a complex inner product: 
they preserve a quaternionic inner product. An equivalent definition is that they satisfy 
ns = - sTn, with n = (~1l ~). Finally, there are five exceptional simple Lie groups, 
G2 , F 4, E6 , E7 and E8 . The algebras for SU(N), SO(N), Sp(N) and the exceptional 
groups are the only finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras [Cartan, 1894]. 
25.1.1 Representations 
We will now discuss representations of the SU(N) groups. These groups play an essential 
role in quantum field theory due to the simple observation that the free theory of N com-
plex fields is automatically invariant under U(l) x SU(N). The SU(N) groups are simply 
connected (see Section 10.5.1), meaning that they are topologically trivial. Thus, represen-
tations of the SU (N) groups are in one-to-one correspondence with representations of the 
su(N) algebra. 
Recall from Section 10.1 that representations of a Lie algebra can be constructed by 
embedding the generators into matrices. The two most important representations are the 
defining (or fundamental) representation and the adjoint representation. The fundamental 
representation is the smallest non-trivial representation of the algebra. For SU(N), the 
fundamental representation is the set of the N x N Hermitian matrices with determinant 
1. A set of N fields cPi transforming in the fundamental representation, transform under 
infinitesimal group transformations as

(25.15) 
where we have used that Tf~nd is Hermitian for SU(N) in the last step. In this way, we can 
always replace anti-fundamental generators with fundamental ones. 
Our default representation will be the fundamental one, so we write Ta (with no 
subscript) for Tf~nd' Generators in a general representation will be denoted T'R. It will 
occasionally be useful to write explicitly the row and column indices i and j as in Tlj. We 
use mid-alphabet Latin letters such as i and j to index the color (for SU(3) of the strong 
interactions) or flavor (as in up or down quark for SU(2)isospin), hence these are sometimes 
called color indices or flavor indices. We use early-alphabet Latin letters such as a and b 
to index different generators in the algebra. 
The algebra can be determined by expanding a basis of group elements around 1. 
For SU(2) the generators in the fundamental representation are the Pauli matrices (J'a 
conventionally normalized by dividing by 2: 
(25.16) 
These satisfy [Ta , Tb J = iEabeTc. For SU (3) the generators are often written in a standard 
basis T a = ~Aa, with A3 and AS diagonal (the Gell-Mann matrices):

The normalization of the generators is arbitrary and a convention must be chosen. 
A common convention in physics is to normalize the structure constants by 
L red jbcd = N 5ab . 
(25.18) 
e,d 
(In mathematics, the convention ~c,d red jbed = 5ab is often used instead.) Once the 
normalization of the structure constants is fixed, the normalization of the generators in any 
representation is also fixed. Indeed, [T'R, TJ?J = irbcT'R, which must hold for any repre-
sentation with the same r bc, is not invariant under rescaling of the T'R. Equation (25.18) 
implies that the generators for SU(N) in the fundamental representation are normalized 
so that

Which you can easily check for SU(2) or SU(3) using the explicit generators above.

and so on. 
(25.21) 
(25.22) 
The next important representation is the adjoint representation, which acts on the vec-
tor space spanned by the generators themselves. For SU(N) there are N 2 -1 generators, so 
this is an N 2 -I-dimensional representation. Matrices describing the adjoint representation 
are given by (T:dj)bc = -irbc. For SU(2) these are 3 x 3 matrices:

soon see, gauge fields must transform in the adjoint representation. There are lots of other 
representations as well, but the fundamental and adjoint representations are by far the most 
important for physics. 
It will be extremely useful to have basis-independent ways to characterize representa-
tions. These are known as Casimir operators or Casimirs. For example, for SU(2) we 
know J2 = 2:a TRTR is a Casimir operator with eigenvalue j(j + 1); j labels the rep-
resentation and is given the special name spin. More generally, we define the quadratic 
Casimir C2 (R) by 
(25.24) 
where the sum over a is implicit. That this operator will always be proportional to the 
identity follows from Schur's lemma: a group element that commutes with all other group 
elements in any irreducible representation must be proportional to 11.. In this case, it is 
enough to show that our operator commutes with all the generators: 
(25.25) 
We have used the anti symmetry of r bc in the last step. Therefore Eq. (25.24) holds for 
some C2 (R) by Schur's lemma. 

25.1 Lie groups 
ge 
'fa evaluate the quadratic Casimir, it is helpful to first define an inner product on the 
nerators. In any representation the generators can be chosen so that 
tr [TRTkJ = T(R)l5ab , 
(25.26) 
wbere T(R) is a number known as the index of the representation. Sometimes C(R) is 
written instead of T(R) for the index. For the fundamental representation, our convention 
in Eq· (25.18) implies

Setting a = bin Eq. (25.26) and summing over a gives 
d(R) C2 (R) = T(R) d(G) , 
(25.27) 
(25.28) 
(25.29) 
wbere d(R) is the dimension ofthe representation (d(fund) = Nand d(adj) = N 2 -1) and 
d(G) is the dimension of the group (number of group generators: d(SU(N)) = N 2 -1). 
Equation (25.29) implies that for SU(N) the quadratic Casimir for the fundamental 
representati on is 
N 2 -1 
CF == C2 (fund) = ~' 
(25.30) 
that is, (TaTa)ij = CF l5ij . In particular, CF" = ~ for SU(2) and CF = ~ for SU(3). For 
the adjoint representation, 
(25.31) 
that is, red f bed = C A l5ab. For the adjoint representation the index and quadratic Casimir 
are the same. Almost every calculation in Yang-Mills theories will have factors of CF or 
CAin it. 
Since, for any representation, 
(25.32) 
We can write 
(25.33) 
Where Ta are the fundamental generators. Thus, we can always replace the structure con-
stants with commutators and products of fundamental group generators. This is extremely 
handy when one tries to compute complicated gluon scattering amplitudes. 
In SU (N) one also has a Fierz identity of the form 
LTijTkl = ~ (l5il l5kj -
~l5ijl5kl) .

Yang-Mills theory 
You can check that, since the generators in SU(N) are traceless, summing'over (N Or chi 
gives zero. This is a useful relation, since it implies 
(25.35) 
for any A and B , which lets us reduce products of traces to single traces. 
Another invariant that characterizes SU(N) representations is the anomaly coefficl' ent 
A(R) defined by 
tr[TR{Tk,TR}] = ~A(R)dabC = A(R)tr[Ta {Tb,TC}] , 
(25.36) 
where dabc are as in Eq. (25.20), or equivalently by A(fund) = 1. These anomaly coeffi_ 
cients will be used in the study of anomalies in Chapter 30. Some relations among them 
are explored in Problem 25.4. 
In summary, the main relations we will use often for SU(N) are 
tr(TaTb) = T'j;Ti~ = TF 6ab , 
2..= (TaTa)ij = CF 6ij ,

with TF = !, CA = Nand CF = N;;/. These relations are used in almost every QeD 
calculation. 
25.2 Gauge invariance and Wilson lines 
Now that we understand the mathematics of Lie groups, we will develop a more geo-
metric way to think about gauge theories. This is not stIictly necessary, and if you just 
want to know the rules for computation, you can safely skip this section (and in fact the 
remainder of this chapter; the Feynman rules for non-Abelian gauge theories are given 
in Section 26.1). 
25.2.1 Abelian case 
Consider first a complex scalar field ¢(x). The phase of this field is just a convention. 
Thus, a theory of such a field should be invariant under redefinitions ¢(x) -+ eie<¢(x) (as 
if Q = 1). Now suppose we want to examine the field at two points xl-' and yl-' very far 
away from each other. In a local theory, the convention that we choose at xl-' should be 
independent of the convention we choose at yl-' . But then how can we tell if ¢(x) = ¢(y)? 
If we changed conventions we would have 
¢(y) - ¢(x) -+ eie«Yl ¢(y) - eie«xl ¢(x). 
(25.40) 

25.2 Gauge invariance and Wilson lines 
o. for example, I¢(y) - ¢(a;)1 depends on our choice of local phases. In fact, it i 
. l~ J sible to ome up with a convention-independent way ro compare the e field at dif-
~er~lll point.. M reover, it is also impos ible [0 compute 8/J-¢(:1,;), ince the derivative i a 
dijference, and the clifference d pend on the pha e choices. 
To make compari ons of field valu 
at different point wen defin -d, we need another 
'ngredient. This motivates defining a new field W (x, y) called a Wilson line. It is a kind of 
~i_local field that depends on two points. We want it to transform as 
W(x, y) --> eia(xlW(x, y)e-ia(Yl 
(25.41) 
SO that 
VV(x, y) ¢(y) - ¢(x) --> eia(xlW(x, y)e-ia(Yleia(Yl¢(y) - eia(xl¢(x) 
= eia(xl [W(x, y) ¢(y) - ¢(x)] , 
(25.42) 
The point of this is that now I W( x, y) ¢(y) - ¢( x) I is independent of our choice of a local 
phase convention. 
Taking y'" = xf-L + oxf-L, dividing by oxf-L, and letting oxf-L --> 0 lets us turn this difference 
into a derivative: 
D ~( ) = r 
W(x, x + ox)¢(x + ox) - ¢(x) 
f-L'I' X 
-
h}'n:,O 
oxf-L 
' 
(25.43) 
Then 
(25.44) 
which holds from Eq. (25.42) even if oxf-L in (25.43) is not small. 
We naturally want W (x, x) = 1. So if oxf-L is small, then we should be able to expand 
(25.45) 
where e is arbitrary. It then follows from the transformation of W(x, y) in Eq. (25.41) that 
(25.46) 
and then, from Eq. (25.43), Df-L¢ = 0f-L¢ - ieAf-L¢' In this way, the gauge field is intro-
duced as a connection, allowing us to compare field values at different points, despite their 
arbitrary phases. Another example of a connection that you might be familiar with from 
general relativity is the Christoffel connection, which allows us to compare field values at 
different points, despite their different local coordinate systems. 
It is possible to write a closed-form expression for VV(x, y): 
Wp(x,y) = exp(ie l
x 
Af-L(Z)dzf-L) . 
(25.47) 
This functional of Af-L (x) is known as a Wilson line. The integral is a line integral along 
the path P from yf-L to xf-L. More precisely, the path P is a function zf-L (A) with 0 ~ A ~ 1 
with zf-L(O) = yf-L and zf-L(l) = xf-L and so

An important observation is that if we set x = y we get a contour integral: 
W~op = exp(iC i A"dX") , 
(25.50) 
which is known as a Wilson loop. Wilson loops are gauge invariant, as can be seen frorn 
Eq. (25.49). By Stokes' theorem, the contour integral can be written as 
W~op = exp (i~ h 
F"vda"V) = 1 + i~ h 
F"vda"v + O(e
2
) 
(25.51) 
over the surface ~ with surface element a"V that the path P bounds. So the Wilson loop 
only depends on the gauge-invariant field strength F"v. As we will discuss in Section 25.5, 
Wilson loops have a simple discretization known as a plaquette, which is used to construct 
the lattice action. 
Next, note that since D,,¢(x) transforms nicely, so will D"Dv¢(x) and so 
(25.52) 
We then have 
Thus, remarkably [D", Dv 1 turns out not to be an operator but just a function. In this way, 
the field strength for QED can be defined as 
(25.54) 
This has a nice geometric interpretation: it is the difference between what you get from 
D"Dv, which compares values for fields separated in the v direction followed by a sep-
aration in the f-L direction, to what you get from doing the comparison in the other order. 
Equivalently, it is the result of comparing field values around an infinitesimal closed loop 
in the f-L - v plane, as shown in Figure 25.1. This is, not coincidentally, also the limit of 
the Wilson loop around a small rectangular path as in Eq. (25.51), as we discuss further in 
Section 25.5. 
25.2.2 Non-Abelian case 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The non-Abelian case is natural for a Lagrangian whose global symmetries include more 
than just a simple phase rotation. For example, the kinetic Lagrangian with N Dirac 
fermions is

This is invariant under a global SU(N) symmetry where the fields transform as

'l"i -+ e 
ij'l"j, 
(25.56) 
where T a are the SU(N) generators in the fundamental representation. 
The SU (N) symmetry of this Lagrangian is a global symmetry because a a does not 
depend on x. But now we have the same problem as in the Abelian case: we cannot compare 
field values at different points and cannot make a well-defined derivative. The solution 
is just as before. For a non-Abelian symmetry, the whole Wilson line construction goes 
through in exactly the same way. The Wilson line is now 
(25.57) 
Here we have inserted a path-ordering operator P{- .. }, which is important because the 
group generators at different points do not commute. You can explore why path ordering 
is necessary in Problem 25.6. The exponential in the Wilson line is defined by its Taylor 
expansion and the path ordering applies to the fields in each term. Explicitly, 
One can define Wilson lines in any representation using A~ TR in the definition in Eq. 
(25.57), but we stick to fundamental Wilson lines for now. Under gauge transformations,

where we have used that Tat = Ta for SU(N). 
In the non-Abelian case, it is often convenient to represent the gauge field as a l" 
algebra-valued field by writing 
Ie, 
(25.60) 
Then, W p (x, y) = P { exp (ig 1; AJ.L (z) dzJ.L) }, which looks a lot like the Abelian caSe. 
(Technically, A~ are the components of a Lie-algebra-valued one-form A = AlJ.dxlJ..) 
The infinitesimal expansion of the Wilson line is 
W(xlJ.,xlJ. + r5xlJ.) =] - igAIJ. r5xJ.L. 
(25.61) 
The local transformations can be expressed in terms of U(x) = eiaa(x)T
a E SU(N), 
which is the group element for the transformation at point x. They are 
~(x) -+ U(x) . ~(x) 
and 
W(x,y) -+ U(x)W(x,y)Ut(y), 
where Ut(y) = U- 1(y) in SU(N). 
(25.62) 
(25.63) 
To determine how A~ transforms, we could just expand the transformation of W. A 
more efficient way to derive the transformation law is to use that the covariant derivative 
must transform like the field DJ.L1l -+ U . DJ.L~ and therefore 
(25.64) 
where A~ is the transformed version of Aj.L" Thus, 
(25.65) 
which implies 
(25.66) 
In terms of components, the infinitesimal version is 
(25.67) 
plus terms higher order in D!. 
Finally, let us look at the commutator of covariant derivatives as before. We now find 
(25.68) 
As in the Abelian case, there are no derivatives acting on 'lj;(x) in this expansion. We noW 
see that the natural field strength in the non-Abelian case is

was defined with generators in the fundamental representation, the kinetic term just 
depends on the F:v fields, which naturally transform in the adjoint representation. 
We can now write down a locally SU(N) invariant Lagrangian:

QED strength e.

perturbation theory (see Section 7.4.2). However, it can contribute due to non-perturbative 
effects, as will be discussed in Sections 29.5 and 30.5. For example, in QeD, e is called 
the strong CP phase. If e were non-zero, the neutron would have an electric dipole moment 
proportional to e. The absence of such a moment experimentally is a mystery known as the 
strong CP problem. 
25.3 Conserved currents

It is not hard to check that the cunent is conserved on the equation of motion, 8"J~ "" 0, 
which we leave for an exercise (Problem 25.5). 
In contrast to the QED cunent, the Noether CUlTent associated with a global non-Abelian 
symmetry in a theory with gauge bosons is not gauge invariant (or even gauge Covari_ 
ant). Thus, it is not physical and there is not a well defined charge that one can measure. 
Although it is true that the charges 
(25.8 1) 
are conserved, that is 8t Qa = 0, these charges depend on our choice of gauge. Thus, in a 
non-Abelian gauge theory such as QeD there is no such thing as a classical cunent, like a 
wire with quarks in it instead of electrons. There is no simple analog of Gauss's law either; 
the gauge fields are bound up with the matter fields in an intricate and nonlinear way. 
One can define a matter current constructed only out of fermions as 
j~ = - -0n/"Tij'I/Jj, 
which is gauge covariant. However, this cunent satisfies 
D"j~ = 0, 
(25.82) 
(25.83) 
where D"j~ = 8"j~ + 9 r bc A~j~ is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation. 
Thus, the matter cunent is not conserved, 81Lj~ #- 0, and there is no associated conserved 
charge. 
Our observations about cunents follow from a very general theorem known as the 
Weinberg-Witten theorem [Weinberg and Witten, 1980): 
A theory with a global non-Abelian symmetry under which massless spin-1 
particles are charged does not admit a gauge-invariant conserved current. 
Another way to phrase the theorem without reference to gauge invariance (which is unphys-
ical) is that there cannot be a conserved Lorentz-covariant cunent in a theory with massless 
spin-l particles with non-vanishing values of the charge associated with that current.

c; 'fhe Weinberg-Witten theorem for spin 2 implies: 
A theory with a conserved and Lorentz-covariant energy-momentum tensor can never 
have a massless paIticle of spin 2. 
In this case also, Lorentz covariance is equivalent to saying that there cannot be a gauge 
field associated with the local symmetry. For the energy-momentum tensor, this local 
Symmetry is local translations (see Section 3.3.1) and the gauge field is the graviton 
(see Section 8.7.2). 
The Weinberg-Witten theorem does not say anything useful about the Standard Model, 
since it has non-conserved currents under which non-Abelian gauge fields and gravity are 
charged and conserved currents that are not gauge invariant. But it does say that if you 
started with a theory without gravity, say only with scalars, spinors and gauge fields, which 
does have a conserved energy-momentum tensor, you would never have some kind of phase 
transition that gives you a massless graviton, since the same energy-momentum tensor 
could no longer exist. String theory and the anti de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) 
correspondence get around this by having gravity emerge in a different space-time - ten 
dimensions for string theory from a two-dimensional world sheet, and four dimensions for 
the CFT from a ten-dimensional string theory. The Weinberg-Witten theorem assumes the 
space-time dimension is fixed. 
25.4 Gluon propagator 
The next step is to derive the gluon propagator. For simplicity, we call the massless spin-l 
particles gluons and the theory QCD, although the derivation that follows applies for any 
gauge group. We will compute the gluon propagator in the covariant Rf. gauges, as we did 
for the photon propagator, but we will find a new feature: Faddeev-Popov ghosts. These 
ghosts are unphysical viltual states. They are an artifact of insisting on Lorentz invariance 
(through the covariant Rf. gauges) from which reemerges the conflict between unitarity for 
massless spin-l particles and manifest Lorentz invariance (this conflict was the subject of 
Chapter 8). In some non-covariant gauges, such as axial gauges, discussed below, ghosts 
are absent. However, covariant gauges are vastly simpler for most calculations despite the 
required ghosts, thus we will learn to work with ghosts as the lesser of two evils. 
25.4.1 Faddeev-Popov procedure 
-
R.ecall our derivation of the photon propagator in QED. We first observed that the equations 
of motion for a photon coupled to an external current,

This modification led to a one-parameter family of propagators' we had t

that our modification would not violate gaug invariance through a dependence of PhYsic<t1 
quantities on~. 
A more systematic way of calculating the photon propagator came with the introduction 
of path integrals in Chapter 14. In Section 14.5 we observed that 
' f(~) = J

(25.86) 
implying that (up to an overall normalization factor A~J J D7r, which drops out of physi-
cal quantities) the un-gauge-fixed Lagrangian will give the same result as the gauge-fixed 
one. The interpretation of the normalization factor is that it describes the path integral Over 
gauge orbits, as can be seen in Eq. (25.85), on which physical quantities do not depend. 
Removing this normalization leaves a path integral over only the physical degrees of free-
dom for a massless spin-l particle. If any of these steps are not familiar, please review the 
derivation in Section 14.5. 
For the non-Abelian theory, we can do the same trick, but there are some subtleties. To 
start, we will need N 2 -
1 fields 7ra . The gauge transformation is more complicated in the 
non-Abelian case. For infinitesimal transformations parametrized by 7ra , we now have 
Aa ----+ Aa + ~o tra + r bcAb 7rc 
I-'

9 I-'

. 
(25.87) 
Since tra is in the adjoint representation, this can be written more concisely as 
1 
A~ ----+ A~ + -DI-'7ra, 
9 
(25.88) 
where DI-'7ra = 01-'7ra + 9rbc At7rc is the way a covariant derivative acts on a field trans-
forming in the adjoint representation. Note that DI-' mixes different tra fields, thus we might 
more accurately write D~b7rb; instead DI-'7ra is used for simplicity. Now let us multiply and 
divide our path integral by 
f[A] = J 
D7r exp [-i J 
d
4x 21~ (OI-'DJ-' 7ra)2] . 
(25.89) 
Unlike in the Abelian case, f is not just a number, but is now a functional of Aw Never-

(25.91) 
where we have redefined A~ ---7 A~ + Df-t1fa in the last step, which leaves £ [A, cPi] unaf-
fected. Since this redefinition removes 1f from the Lagrangian, the 1f integral just gives an 
unphysical constant. The result is almost identical to the Abelian case, except now i[A] 
depends on the gauge fields. 
Before evaluating this integral, let us pause and think about what is going on. When 
we gauge-fix the path integral, we are no longer guaranteed that only the physical trans-
verse modes of A~ propagate. Indeed, there are additional modes 1fa that have 4-derivative 
kinetic terms, and are therefore ghost-like (see Section 8.7). However, the path integral also 
tells us we have to divide out by the diagrams involving 1fa, just as we divide out by the 
vacuum bubbles in calculating the connected Green's functions. We could just calculate 
this way. But it is easier to rewrite j[A] in such a way that we can add Feynman diagrams 
instead of subtracting them. 
To simplify j[A], observe that in the form of Eq. (25.89), despite its dependence on Af-t, 
i[A] is still quadratic in 1f, so we can perform the Gaussian integral as a functional of AI-'" 
We find

with the determinant in the numerator.

Grassmann numbers: 
det( 0) = 1 
v1jJV1j; exp ( ~i 1

4x 1jJ01j; ) . 
(25.94) 
Thus, we can write 
(25.95) 
497

Yang-Mills theory 
for Grassmann.-valued fields c and C. Thus, we finally have the gauge-fixed path integral 
for a non-Abehan gauge theory: 
Z[O] = const. x jDAI"D¢iDCDcexp {ij d4x [.e[A, ¢d -
21~ (OI"A~)2 - caol" D I"CQ ]}. 
(25.96) 
Here ca and ca are anticommuting Lorentz scalars, called Faddeev-Popov ghosts a 
anti-ghosts respectively. There is one ghost and one anti-ghost for each gauge field. T~~ 
sector of this gauge-fixed Lagrangian involving just the non-Abelian gauge bosons is 
.eRE. = -~(F:v)2 -
2~ (OI"A~)2 + (0l"ca) (8ac01" + grbc At)cc. 
(25.97) 
This is the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian. The resulting propagator is

v;b ~QQQQQQQj /1;a = 
i 
p2 8ab 
p 
p2 + iE 
' 
(25.98) 
which is the same as the photon propagator up to the 8ab term. The ghost propagator and 
the interaction vertices for Yang-Mills theory are given in Section 26.l. 
Ghosts are unphysical since they violate the spin-statistics theorem. As we showed in 
Chapter 12, there cannot be physical states that anticommute and transform like scalars 
under the Lorentz group. However, nothing prevents ghosts from appearing in the path 
integral. As with physical fields, one can expand the path integral in perturbation theory, 
generating Feynman diagrams involving these ghosts. For S-matrix elements of physical 
states, the ghosts will appear in internal lines. 
One way to understand why ghosts have to be ferrnionic is so that they can cancel 
unphysical degrees of freedom of the gluons in loops. When we take the gluons off-shell, 
we are no longer guaranteed to have the right number of physical degrees of freedom. The 
ghosts are fermionic because they need a -1 in loops to cancel the + 1 from the unphysical 
polarizations. 
One can generalize the above argument to allow for integrals along arbitrary gauge orbits 
to be factored out. Begin by picking a gauge, that is, some element of the equivalence class 
of gauge fields, and call it A~. Fields in this gauge satisfy some constraint OrAl == 0, 
where C is a functional. For example, in Lorenz gauge we could take G[A] = 0I"A~. Any 
gauge field can be written as A~ = A~ + DJ.<7ra for some 7ra . In this way, we should be 
able to split the path integral into an integral over A~ and an integral over 7ra . To do so, we 
observe that 
(25.99) 
(25.100) 

25.4 Gluon propagator 
~-----------------------------------------------
as above. Folding the 1 in Eq. (25.99) into the path integral gives 
NoW we can shift A~ --7 A~ + DI"7ra . This is a linear shift, accompanied by a global 
transformation, so the measure does not change. Assuming the determinant is independent 
o[1r, we then have 
Z[Oj ~ con'" [j D'l J

d
4x £[A, ¢il). (25.102) 
The 7r integral is now just an (infinite) constant. Now we note that if we shift G by a 
constant the determinant does not change. So we can average over a Gaussian-weighted 
selection of shifts using 
Thus, 
For G[A~l 
0l"AI" this reduces to the Lagrangian for the covariant gauges discussed 
above. 
25.4.2 BRST invariance 
Since Faddeev-Popov ghosts are so strange, it is worth considering why they must be there 
from another perspective. Recall that to be able to renormalize a theory, we need to include 
every operator consistent with symmetries, or else there may be infinities for which we 
do not have appropriate counterterms. In QED, although gauge invariance was broken by 
the ~(Ol"AI")2 term, we still used gauge invariance to forbid additional gauge-violating 
terms. We were able to get away with this in QED because AI" coupled to a conserved 
CUrrent, so modifying only its kinetic term had no effect. In QCD, the gauge fields do 
not couple to a conserved current because of self-interactions of the gauge fields, so the 
* 
(Ol"A~) 2 term, with its associated Faddeev-Popov ghosts, is not so clearly an innocuous 
deformation. Remarkably, when ghosts are included, the QCD Lagrangian retains an exact 
global symmetry called BRST invariance (named after Becchi, Rouet, Stara and Tyutin). 
499

Yang-Mills theory 
BRST invariance is therefore critical in proving renormalizability of non-Abelian ga 
. 
Uge 
theones. 
BRST invariance can be seen even in QED, where it is a little simpler. Taking the Abelia 
limit of the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian with scalar matter fields ¢i included, we find 
n 
.c = -~F;" + (DI"¢n(D,'¢i) - m
2¢:¢i -
21~(Ol"A,i - cD c. 
(25.105) 
The term 21~ (Ol"AI")2 breaks the gauge symmetry down to a residual symmetry under which 
AI" --> AJ.L + ~oJ.La for fields a(x) satisfying On = O. This is a residual symmetry of the 
entire Lagrangian. Now note that the equations of motion for c and c are Dc = Dc :::: O. 
Thus, instead of gauge transforming with a parameter n, we can gauge transform with 
0'( x) = Bc( x) for any Grassmann number B. In other words, the Lagrangian is invariant 
under 
¢i(X) --> eifJc(x)¢i(X) = ¢i(X) + i8c(x)¢i(X), 
1 
AJ.L(x) --> AI"(x) + -8oJ.Lc(x) , 
e 
(25.106) 
(25.107) 
as long as the equations of motion Dc = Dc = 0 can be used. If we do not use the equations 
of motion, we find the first three terms in Eq. (25.105) are invariant; however, 
2

(0l"AJ.L) 
--> (o,"AJ.L) + -(o,AI") (Boc) + 2" (8oc)(8oc) . 
e 
e 
(25.108) 
Since B is Grassmann, B2 = 0 and the last term vanishes. Thus, if we also take 
(25. 109) 
then the Lagrangian is invariant without using the equations of motion. This is an example 
of BRST invariance. Since 8c(x) acts like O'(x) for the AJ.L and ¢i transformations, BRST 
is a generalization of gauge invariance that holds despite the gauge-breaking 21~ (Ol"AI")2 
term. 
In the non-Abelian case, the Lagrangian is 
(25.1 10) 
where DJ.Lca = oJ.Lca + grbc Atcc. Thus, we can proceed as in the Abelian case, defining 
the transformations as

As in the Abelian case, these are just gauge transformations with aa(x) = Bca(x) when 
acting on ¢i or A~; thus, .c[A~, ¢i] is invariant. Also the transformation of (Ol"ca) is

designed to exactly cancel the transformation of -
21~ (O{LA~) 2. However, unlike in the 
Abelian case, the D {L ca term is not invariant, because of the A ~ hidden in D {L ca: 
(25.114) 
fa make this covariant derivative invariant, we will need to transform ca as well. This can 
be done by defining the BRST transformation for ca as 
(25.115) 
Note that nowhere did we use that ca and ca were related in any way (as 1jJ and 1jJ are related 
by charge-conjugation invariance); thus, we are free to give them different transformation 
laws. To check this, we compute 
D{Lca -t D{Lca + erbC(D{Lcb) CC - erbc D 
(O{LCb)cc + ~cb(O{LCC) + ~A~rdecdce] . 
(25.116) 
The first two terms in brackets are equal, since (0 {L cb) C
C = -cC ( 0 {L cb) and f abc = - facb. 
For the last term, we note that by the Jacobi identity in Eq. (25.11), 
f abc f cde A~cdce = _ fbdc fcae A~cdce _ fdac f cbe A~cdce 
= 2fabc f bed A~cdcc, 
(25.117) 
where we have used antisymmetry of r bc and a fair amount of index relabeling to get to 
the second line. We therefore have that 
D{Lca -t D{Lca +e r bc (D{Lcb) CC - e r bc [( O{LCb) CC + gfbed A~cdccl = D{Lca (25.118) 
and that LFP is invariant. 
We conclude that the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian is BRST invariant. BRST invariance 
is global symmetry parametrized by a Grassmann number e under which fields transform 
as in Eqs. (25.111) to (25.115). 
One implication of BRST invariance is for renormalization. Since BRST invariance is 
an exact symmetry of the Lagrangian, it will be preserved in loops. Thus, one will not 
need any counterterms that violate BRST invariance. Since the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and 
anti-ghosts are critical in establishing BRST invariance of the gauge-fixed non-Abelian 
Lagrangian, this strongly constrains how they can appear at higher orders. The proof of 
renormalizability for non-Abelian theories shows that all the infinities are canceled with the 
finite number of counterterms corresponding to terms in the most general BRST-invariant 
Lagrangian. 
By the way, BRST invariance has a sophisticated mathematical foundation and many 
formal applications. For example, if one writes the transformations as cPi -t cPi + el:;,.cPi, 
A~ -'> A~ + el:;,.A~ and so on, the operator I:;,. turns out to be nilpotent, 1:;,.2 = o. You 
can check this in Problem 25.7. I:;,. is sometimes called the Slavnov operator. Thus, all 
states that are exact, IX) = I:;,.IY), for some IY) are closed, I:;,. IX) = O. This establishes 
a COhomology: there is a well-defined equivalence class of states that are closed but not 
exact. It turns out that one can identify physical states with the cohomology of 1:;,.. Shifting

25.4.3 Axial gauges 
---
The whole discussion of ghosts and BRST in the previous sections makes it seem like 
these are crucial things. Ghosts are in fact crucial, in the sense that you have to include 
them to get the right answer in perturbation theory, at least in covariant gauges. But ghOsts 
are also unphysical. They arise as an artifact of insisting on a gauge in which the gill on 
propagator is Lorentz covariant. If we never tried to embed the two physical polarizations 
of a massless spin-l particle into a field All (x) we would never have had to deal with 
ghosts. Or, if we restricted to gauge-invariant objects, such as the field strength FILII (as is 
done on the lattice), we also would not have to deal with ghosts. 
An alternative to dealing with ghosts is to choose a gauge in which the ghosts decou_ 
ple from the physical particles, and hence can be ignored. All such gauges are expliCitly 
Lorentz violating. The most important class of non-covariant gauges are the axial gauges,

Axial gauges make it clear that ghosts are not strictly necessary to describe non-Abelian 
auge theories. In practice, unless you are in a situation where there is some natural 
~irection r", axial gauges are very unwieldy. Ghosts are a formal annoyance, but from 
a practical point of view they are not that bad. On the other hand, for external polariza-
tions, having the freedom to choose r" separately for each gluon (corresponding to a basis 
of transverse polarizations) can be extremely useful. We will show how this freedom can 
be exploited to great practical advantage in Chapter 27 (on the spinor-helicity formalism). 
further discussion of non-covariant gauges can be found in [Liebbrandt, 1987]. 
25.5 Lattice gauge theories 
Before going on to perturbative calculations in non-Abelian gauge theories, it is worth 
discussing the only systematically improvable method for computing non-perturbative 
quantities in gauge theories: the lattice. Lattice simulations are useful when gauge fields 
are strongly interacting, as is the case for QCD at low energies. There are enormous practi-
cal difficulties with lattice simulations, and many open theoretical questions (such as how 
to simulate chiral gauge theories). Here we only superficially summarize the approach to 
lattice QCD pioneered by Wilson. This discussion is adapted from [Gattringer and Lang, 
2010]. 
Let us define a four-dimensional lattice with n sites sites in each dimension spaced a 
distance a apart. We denote the lattice sites by n. On the lattice, quantum field theory 
reduces to quantum mechanics with n~tes fields. Matter fields ¢( n) naturally reside on the 
lattice sites. We denote by fl a vector of unit length a in the p, direction, so ¢ (n + fl) and 
¢(n) are the field values on nearest-neighbor sites. Gauge transformations are also discrete, 
so we can rotate fields by group elements 
¢(n) --+ U(n) . ¢(n), 
(25.122) 
where U(n) = exp(iaa(n)Ta) defined separately on each site. To be able to compare field 
values at different sites in a gauge-invariant way, we need the discrete version of the Wilson 
line discussed in Section 25.2. We therefore define new fields W,,(n) transforming as 
(25.123) 
Then, 
¢t(n)W,,(n)¢(n + fl) --+¢t(n)Ut(n) U(n)W/-l(n)UI(n + fl) U(n + fl)¢(n + fl) 
=¢t (n)W" (n)¢(n + fl). 
(25.124) 
PrOducts of fields on distant lattice sites can be multiplied in a gauge-invariant way by 
multiplying together W,,(ni) factors along any path between the sites. The W/-l(n) can be 
thought to live between neighboring sites; thus they are called link fields. To connect any 
two sites, it is enough to have one link between every neighboring pair. For convenience,

The plaquette W 1'1/ (n) is a gauge-invariant object constructed from multiplying links in a 
closed loop. 
we also define 
(25.125) 
which acts as a link in the opposite direction. In analogy to the continuum case, we write 
TV/L(n) = exp(iaA/L (n)) , 
(25.126) 
where A/L(N) = A~(N)Ta and a is the lattice spacing. The coupling g, which is not a 
useful quantity on the lattice, has been absorbed into the gauge field. 
To construct the Yang-Mills action, we need a gauge-invariant object constructed out of 
the link fields. These will be the analogs of the Wilson loop. Indeed, from the transforma_ 
tion property in Eq. (25.123), any closed loop of links will be gauge invariant. The simplest 
loop just goes between two sites and back. However, since W/L (N)W _/L (n + fl) = ], this 
it not useful. The next simplest loop, which is non-trivial, goes in a little square. We call 
this a plaquette (see Figure 25.2) and define it by 
W/Lv(N) == W_v(n + v) TV_/L (n + fl + v) Wv(n + fl) W/L(N) 
= W~(N)W~(n + v) Wv(n + fl) lY/L(N). 
(25.127) 
To connect plaquettes to the continuum field strengths F/Lv(x) we can rewrite H T/-l V with 
the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula: 
exp(A) exp(B) = exp ( A + B + ~ [A, B] + ... ) . 
Up to order a 2 we find

To connect to the continuum limit, we Taylor expand:

(25.131) 
where F"" == (8"A" - 8I/A,,) - i [A", A"j, as in Eq. (25.69) with 9 = 1. Expanding at

(25.133) 
where Eq. (25.28) has been used to get the factor of N in the last step. We therefore define 
the Yang-Mills action on the lattice as 
(25.134) 
The lattice action is the sum over all plaquettes, which are in turn defined in terms of link 
fields TF,,(N) . One can now evaluate the path integral for the lattice (in Euclidean space) 
numerically by literally summing over values for the links at each site. 
There are many things one can calculate with the lattice. For a concrete example, the 
most straightforward physical quantities to calculate are particle masses. These can be 
extracted from 2-point functions, which are calculated on the lattice by inserting fields at 
different lattice points into the discretized path integral weighted by the Euclidean action. 
For example, to calculate the pion mass in QCD with one flavor, one would calculate the 
discrete Euclidean version of 
C(x)(!1 IO(O)O(x)I!1) = J 
DA"DiiDueisO(O)O(x), 
(25.135) 
where O(x) = u(xh 5u(x). This correlation function should die off at large distances as 
e-mr , where m is the mass of the lightest particle with the same quantum numbers as 
O. Thus, by varying the distance between the points, one can extract asymptotic behavior. 
One wants to find characteristic scaling at intermediate regimes, as shown on the left Fig-
Ure 25.3. This plot indicates that the pion mass scales as the square root of quark masses, 
a result we will derive using dural perturbation theory in Chapter 28. By using one such 
mel s t 
el the overall units, one can then predict other thing . uch as other particle masses. 
Besides ma es the lattice is used to calculate many non-perlllrbative quantities, such as 
form factor . . The lattice also gives insights into purely theoretical issues, such as sponta-
neous symmetry breaking in Yang-Mills theories with various number of flavors and colors 
(see Chapter 28).

In the previous chapter, we introduced Yang-Mills theory as the natural generalization of 
electrodynamics to systems with many fields. If we have N fields (Pi, then the Lagrangian 
.[ = -¢iD¢i is invariant under a global SU(N) symmetry, under which ¢i -7 UWPj for 
U E SU(N). In Yang-Mills theory there are massless spin-! particles which transform in 
the adjoint representation of SU(N). Since SU(N) is a non-Abelian group, Yang-Mills 
theories are often called non-Abelian gauge theories. It is perhaps worth emphasizing that 
the impOltant feature of these theories is not gauge invariance (which is an unphysical fea-
ture of Lagrangians) but the existence of massless spin-l particles that are charged, that is, 
they carry quantum numbers. In the next chapter we will discuss a method for performing 
S-matrix calculations in Yang-Mills theories that sidesteps gauge invariance altogether. 
These caveats aside, introducing a local Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory with gauge 
inv31iance is by far the most powedul and general method for studying these theories. 
Thus, we focus in this chapter on perturbative calculations in non-Abelian gauge theories. 
In Chapter 25, gauge invariance was motivated as allowing us to choose a different 
SU(N) convention at different points. We saw that we could compare field values at dif-
ferent points in a convention-independent way if we used Wilson lines W(x, y) defined so 
that W(x, y) ¢ (y) transforms as ¢(x). Expanding such a Wilson line out for small devia-
tions led to W (x, x + c5x) = l - igc5x" A~Ta, where T a are the generators of SU (N) in the 
fundamental representation. In this way, we found that a local theory needs one gauge field 
A~ for each generator, and thus the gauge fields A~ transform in the adjoint representation 
ofSU(N). 
Next, we found that, in computing the propagator for the gauge boson, we had to gauge-
fix, as in QED. But in the non-Abelian case, the covariant gauge-fixing (Re, gauges), 
when done properly through the path integral, generated new particles called Faddeev-
Popov ghosts, which have spin 0 but fermionic statistics. These particles never appear as 
external states but must be included in internal lines for consistency. That we need these 
ghosts is a horrible consequence of the Lagrangian formulation of field theory. There is 
no observable consequence of ghosts, we just need them to describe an interacting theory 
of massless spin-! particles using a local manifestly Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian. Alter-
native formulations (such as the lattice) do not require ghosts. Perturbative gauge theories 
in certain non-covariant gauges, such as lightcone gauge, are also ghost free. However, to 
maintain manifest Lorentz invariance in a perturbative gauge theory, it seems ghosts are 
unavoidable. 
In this chapter we will perform some perturbative calculations in the non-Abelian theory. 
This will allow us to understand both the theory of the strong interactions, QCD, which is 

26.1 Feynman rules 
509 
~--------------------------------------...... 
a non-Abelian gauge theory with gauge group SU(3), and the theory of the weak inter-
actions, which is based on SU(2). For simplicity, we will refer to the non-Abelian gauge 
theory as QeD, and the gauge bosons as gluons. Our results will be more general than this, 
but it is helpful to talk about QeD for concreteness. 
We will discuss some tree-level and I-loop results, including probably the most impor-
tant calculation in QeD - vacuum polarization. We will find that the QeD gauge coupling 
runs in the opposite direction from QED: it gets larger at larger distances. This makes the 
phenomenology of QeD completely different from the phenomenology of QED. In the 
next chapter, we will return to tree-level graphs through the spinor-helicity formalism. 
Due to the many possible contractions in each vertex, calculations in non-Abelian gauge 
theories quickly get intractably complicated. For example, the process gg ---+ ggg even at 
tree-level contains around 10 000 terms. Part of the reason things are so complicated is 
because there is a huge redundancy when we sum over off-shell intermediate states. In the 
next chapter, we will see that there is a smarter way to organize the tree-level structure. In 
this chapter we concentrate on processes with few gluons so that the number of terms is 
manageable and we can perform the calculations using traditional Feynman rules. 
26.1 Feynman rules 
The first step in performing perturbative calculations in a non-Abelian gauge theory is to 
work out the Feynman rules. The SU(N)-invariant Lagrangian for a set of N fermions and 
N scalars interacting with non-Abelian gauge fields is

(26.2) 
We have included scalars in this Lagrangian for generality, even though we have observed 
no scalar states in nature that are colored (charged under QeD). Many theories, such as 
supersymmetric QeD, do have colored scalars. The Higgs doublet in the Standard Model 
is an example of a scalar field charged under the weak gauge group SU(2).

These oab and oij factors just say that the color that comes in is the same as the color that

propagators appear as intermediate states.

where the sum over a is implicit and the i, j , k and l indices refer to the colors of the 
external quarks and antiquarks. This is identical to the QED case, up to e -> -gs, where 
g8 is the strong coupling constant, and the addition of the color factors. With on-shell 
spinors the ~ dependence drops out, as in QED. 
To understand the TXiTkl coefficient, let us consider different choices for the color of 
the incoming u and d quarks. There are three possibilities for each, which we often call 
red, green and blue for quarks and anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue for antiquarks. For 
example, suppose the incoming u is red and the incoming Ii is anti-green (i = 1, k = 2). 
Then, by explicit computation using Eq. (25.l5), 
(26.16) 
so that j = 1 and l = 2. Thal is, the final tate mllst at 0 have a red quark and an anti-green 
antiquark. This is, of course, just becau e color icon crved. Since Tu T22 = -~, the 
t-channel diagram ha the oppo. ire sign from the - 13+ ase and the potential is therefore 
repulsive (as it would be for say e+p+ scattering). 
On the other hand, suppose the u is red but the Ii is anti-red. Then the initial state is a 
color singlet. In this case i = 1 and k = 1 and

That only the color singlet channel is attractive is consistent with the observational fact 
that we do not find colored mesons (quark/antiquark bound states) in nature. 
In QCD, color-neutral bound states are called hadrons. Hadrons are either mesons, 
or baryons that are bound states of three quarks such as B = 
eijkqiqjqk (see Sec-
tion 28.2.3). One can perform a similar bound-state analysis for baryon QCD (see for 
example [Griffiths, 2008]). 
Unfortunately, the potentials we calculated are not quantitatively useful for the physics 
of light mesons such as pions. The problem is that 98 » 1 at low energy. We will discuss 
the scale dependence of 98 soon. But before that, we have to dis,?uss a way to measure 98 
in the first place. 
26.3 e+ e- ---+ hadrons and as 
One way to measure the strong coupling constant is from scattering processes. In particular, 
the total cross section for e+ e-
---+ hadrons, inclusive over the final-state hadrons, will 
giVe a clean way to measure 98' e+e-
---+ hadrons is a straightforward generalization of 
e+ e- ---+ muons discussed in depth in Chapter 20. All we have to do is add the color factors 
and appropriate sum over charges. 
26.3.1 e+ e- ---+ hadrons at tree-level 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The process e+ e- ---+ hadrons can proceed through an intermediate photon or a Z boson. 
Although we have not formally introduced the Z boson yet, as far as QCD is concerned, it

appear as asymptotic states and therefore do not have well-defined pole masses. 
In Chapter 20 we calculated that the total cross section for unpolarized e+ e- ~ ,* --? 
p,+ p,- scattering at tree-level is 
(26,21) 
The Feynman diagram for quark production is identical, except now we must factor in the 
charges of the quarks and sum over quark colors. Only color singlet pairs such as red/anti-
red can be produced. And thus we get a factor of N = 3 from the color sum. Thus, at 
tree-level, 
u(e+e- ~ qq) = 3uo ( (~y + (-~y + (-~y + (~y + (-~y + (~y),

The center-of-mass energies at LEP (an e+ e- collider at CERN), which ranged from 90 
to 205 Ge V, were above the bottom-quark pair-production threshold (rv9 Ge V) but below 
the top-quark pair-production threshold (rv350 Ge V), and so only five quarks should be 
summed over to compare theory to LEP data. The theory prediction for LEP is therefore

26.3.2 e+e- --7 hadrons at next-to-Ieading order 
------------------------------------------------------------------
NoW let us consider the radiative corrections to the total e+ e-
---7 hadrons rate. Again, 
we will be able to steal the results for the radiative correctipns to e+ e-
---7 f.L+ f.L- , which 
we computed in Chapter 20, modifying them only with the appropriate color factors when 
necessary. 
There are two real-emission contributions at next-to-leading order given by the diagrams 
(26.26) 
These are identical to the e+ e-
---7 f.L+ f.L- ,,( diagrams from Chapter 20, up to the replace-
ment e ---7 - 9s and the addition of a color matrix TIj, where a is the color of the gluon 
and i and j are the colors of the quarks. When we square these diagrams to get the cross 
section for fixed external colors, we get MMt rv TtjTj~ with no sum over a. For the color-
summed cross section, we then sum over a, i and j to get factor of Tr[TQTaj = CF = ~. 
Integrating over phase space gives the same thing as in QED, up to a e ~ as, the CF and 
0"0 -+ R~~aa from Eq. (26.24). So we have, from Eq. (20.A.102) of Chapter 20,

(26.27) 
The virtual graph 
(26.28) 
is also the same as in QED up to e ~ - 98' the color matrices, and the factor of R~~. In this 
case, the color matrices are TI'kTkj summed over a, since the gluon propagator contains 
a oab factor. The tree-level graph which contributes to the same final state has only a 6ij 
factor. Thus, the interference between these two gives TI'kTkj' Summing over final-state

As expected, the IR divergences cancel when we sum these graphs, giving a result 
(26.30) 
The Z boson couples like the photon with different charges (and different charges for left_ 
and right-handed quarks, as we will see in Chapter 29). However, QCD corrections are the 
same for left- or right-handed quarks, since QCD is non-chiral. Thus we find 
Rhad = R~ad (1 + :s + 0 ( a~ ) ) . 
(26.31) 
Thus, to explain the 3.5% discrepancy from the LEP 1 data, we require 7 
0.035 Or 
as = 0.11. For comparison, the fine-structure constant at LEP 1 energies is ae(mz) ~ 
1~9 = 0.0077. 
There are many other ways to measure as, such as from the hadronic decay rate of the T 
lepton, from deep inelastic scattering, lattice calculations, multijet rates, event shapes, etc. 
In each of these measurements, as is extracted from physical quantities. However, 0: 8 is 
only defined within some regularization and subtraction scheme, so some convention must 
be chosen to make comparisons between these extractions useful. In particular, since 0:
8 
is scale dependent (see next section), one also needs to evolve as to a common scale. It 
is conventional to present results for O:s defined in dimensional regularization with mod-
ified minimal subtraction (MS) at the scale /.L = mz. A comparison of various values of 
as extracted at different scales using different methods is shown in Figure 26.1. As of

26.4 Vacuum polarization 
~-----------------------------------------------
tIlis writing, the current world average is as = 0.1184 ± 0.0007. In the next section, we 
calculate the QCD fJ-function, which allows us to evolve as between the different scales. 
26.4 Vacuum polarization 
NoW we turn to vacuum polarization and the QCD fJ-function. Unlike in QED, where only 
tile electron loop contributed at I-loop order, in QCD there are five contributions: 
(26.32) 
given by the graphs 
~. 
+ ~ 
~ 
+ ~. 
(26.33) 
....... 
The first is the fermion (or scalar) loop, the next two are gauge boson loops, the fourth is 
the ghost loop and the fifth is the counterterm. We will use dimensional regularization to 
compute these loops, since it preserves gauge invariance. We will also do the calculation 
in Feynman gauge, ~ = 1, for which the propagator is 
(26.34) 
Results for arbitrary ~ are summarized at the end of this section (you can check them as an 
exercise). We will also express answers in terms of SU(N) Casimirs, so they will be valid 
for any N. 
26.4.1 Fermion bubble 
The fermionic loop is almost identical to the QED case. The integral is 
k - p 
iM';,?/-'v =

k 
== - trTaTb] (ig)2 J 
(~:~4 (p _ k)i2 _ m2 k2 ~ m2 Trh/-'(~ -? + mh,v(~ + m)]. 
(26.35) 
This is exactly the same as in QED but with a color factor tr[TaTb] = TFoab out front, 
With T F = ~. The result, as in the QED case, manifestly preserves gauge invariance. The 
result has the form 
(26.36) 
517 

518 
Quantum Yang-MillS theory 
So, taking loop amplitude from Chapter 16, Eq. (16.47) is expanded as in Eq. (16.45): 
(26.37)

26.4.2 Gluon bubble 
For the Ward identity to be satisfied in Yang-Mills theory, the contribution from the gluon 
and ghost graphs should be proportional to gJ.LV p2 - pJ.Lpv. The gluon bubble is

The overall factor of ~ is a symmetry factor that is required since gluons are their own 
antiparticles (unlike quarks). The numerator is

x [gV,6 (p+k)" - gf3°-(2k - pr _ gC7V(2p _ k)f3]. 
(26.40) 
We next introduce Feynman parameters, so 
(26.41) 
We then complete the square by k -; k + xp. This leads to 
(26.42)

(26.43) 
AS usual, the kl-'pv and k . p terms vanish since they are odd in k -> -k, so terms in the 
second line vanish. In dimensional regularization, we can replace kl-' kV -> ~ k2 gl-'v. Then 
the integrals are all straightforward. The result is

(26.44) 
Before analyzing this further, let us work out the other graphs. As in QED, it is expected 
that only the sum of all the relevant graphs will satisfy the Ward identity.

26.5 Renormalization at 1-loop

how the theory is renormalized. Introducing field strength, mass, and coupling constant 
renormalizations, the QCD Lagrangian becomes

Since the coupling constant appears in four different places, we actually need four separate 
renormalization factors for it, which we have called ZI, ZA3, ZA4 and Zlc' We will omit 
the SUbscripts R on the renormalized Lagrangian parameters in this section for simplicity.

The 2-point functions will give us 62, 6m, 63 and 63c. Let us start with the vacuum

have

function involving the ghost-gluon vertex to find the remaining counterterms, 0 A3, 0 A4 and 
81c at I-loop. The explicit calculations make a useful exercise (Problem 26.2). However, 
due to gauge invariance, these counterterms are in fact determined by the counterterms we 
have already computed (see Eqs. (26.80)-(26.87) below).

off. 
26.6 Running coupling 
With the results for these I-loop counterterms, we can now calculate the (3 function for non-
Abelian gauge theories. As discussed in Chapter 23, the renormalization group equation is 
determined by demanding that observables be independent of, variously, the UV cutoff, the 
subtraction point where the theory is renormalized, or the arbitrary scale fJ, in dimensional 
regularization. In practice, using MS subtraction, one usually sets fJ, equal to the subtraction 
point and then uses fJ, independence to find 0;(fJ,) as a solution to the RGE.

Since each 0 only depends on p. through gR, we solve this perturbatively, giving 
C C28 (

(3(gR) = -2gR + 2gR8gR 01 - 02 - 203 
. 
(26.92) 
Using the 1-100p values for the counterterms, we find 
(26.93) 
Note the very important fact that the ~ dependence completely cancels in (3(g R)' 
We could equally well have computed the {3-function for the running of the charge in 
the A3 interaction. Then we would have computed {3 from 
(26.94) 
That this gives the same answer as using the coupling to fermions is due to gauge 
invariance, as discussed in Section 26.6.3 below.

Specializing to QeD now, we take N = a, so C A = 3, and we write as = ~. Then, 
also using TF = ~, the RGE at I-loop (at c = 0) is p. d: as = - ~;{3o, with (30 = 11 -
2~f . 
So as long as there are fewer than 17 flavors of quarks (there are six in nature), (30 > 0 and 
hence a(p.) decreases with increasing p.. The solution to the 1-100p RGE can be written as 
2:rr

as(p.) = -(3- ln.-l':....-'

where AQCD is the location of the Landau pole of QeD. In contrast to QED, since aip.) 
increases at smaller p., this equation is valid for p. > AQCD . As discussed in Section 23.2, 
the scale A QCD appears through dimensional transmutation as a boundary condition set by 
a renormalization condition at a particular scale. Measuring Q s at any scale fixes AQCD . 
That the coupling constant gets weaker at high energy is called asymptotic freedom. 
Asymptotic freedom explains a number of important qualitative features of the strong inter-
actions, such as how QeD can be strong but also short-ranged and why free quarks have 
never been seen. 
26.6.2 Higher-order ,a-function 
The expansion of the QeD {3-function, (3( as) == p. d: as, in powers of as is

differential equation for as (p.) one can set c = O. The QeD (3-function is currently known

The 4-loop f3-function is one of the great triumphs of perturbative QeD. A comparison

26.6.3 Charge universality 
Recall that in QED Z1 = Z2 exactly in the on-shell scheme (as we proved in Section 19.5)· 
This is not the case in QeD, as can be seen explicitly from the I-loop counterterms. 
In QED, Z1 = Z2 had a number of implications. For example, it implied that there is 
a un'iver a1 electric charge even after radiative corrections. That is, the electron charge 
and lh prolon charge get renormalized in the same way, despite the fact that beyond 
I-loop the radjative con'ections are very different for the two objects. We also understood 

529 
26.7 Defining the charge 
~--------------------------~--------------- ~ .... 
Zl ::::: Z2 as a consequence of the non-renorm~lization of charge. In particular, we found 
. Section 23.4.1 that the QED current, JI" = 1/Y'(I"'lj;, was not renormalized. 
10 
Similarly, if there are two different species of quark, such as the up and down quarks, 
we would expect that they would couple to QCD with the same strength. With two species 
of quark, there are two separate interaction terms: 
from this equation we see that it is not strictly necessary to have Zl = Z2 for all quarks, 
only that the ratio Zd Z2 be the same. That Zd Z2 is the same for all quarks at I-loop 
folloWS trivially from the flavor independence of Zl and Z2. Thus, as far as quarks are con-
cerned, there is a universal renormalized charge gR and a well-defined covariant derivative, 
D/1 == op. - i9RA~Ta. 
For a non-trivial check, we recall that the same charge gR appears in the QCD 
Lagrangian multiplying the interactions of quarks with gluons as well as the gluon self-
interactions. We saw in Section 26.4 that the relative size of the gluon 3- and 4-point 
self-interactions was critical to the Ward identity being satisfied at I-loop. Thus, if the 
couplings of the 3- and 4-point vertices were renormalized differently, the Ward identity 
would be violated. The only way all of the factors of g8 in the QeD Lagrangian will be 
renormalized in the same way is if 
(26.104) 
At I-loop, from Eqs. (26.80) to (26.87), we find that 
(26.105) 
so that Eq. (26.104) does in fact hold to order g2. Indeed, charge in Yang-Mills theories is 
universal. 
26.7 Defining the charge 
Unlike in QED, where there are many ways to define the electric charge (from the 3-point 
fUnction, from the potential between two classical currents, etc.), in Yang-Mills theories, 
defining the charge with an observable is much more subtle. The problem is that the QeD 
current, J~, is not gauge invariant, as was discussed in Section 25.3. First we will see how 
the definition of the charge from generalizing QED fails for the QeD case, then we will 
deSCribe a gauge-invariant definition through the expectation value of a Wilson loop.

26.7.1 Physical definition of the strong coupling ----
Suppose we had tried to calculate the running coupling in QCD as we did in QED, b 
calculating the potential between two charges. That is, we calculate 
y 
V(1') = (DIT { JO (1')JO(O)} ID) , 
(26.106) 
with JO(x) = 6a(x), i(x) = 0 and; = Ixl. In QED (as we s,:w back in
2Section 3.4), th 
leading-order potential is V(1') = 4"rr,. or in momentum space V(r) = p. This is jUst the 
photon propagator with two factors of e from the eAfLJfL coupling in the Lagrangian. Ae 
next-to-leading order, we showed in Chapter 16 that the vacuum polarization graphs gl' t

which is equivalent to what you would get from the QED ,B-function calculation. 
In QCD this physical interpretation of the running coupling does not work. The analogy 
would be a potential defined from 
(DIT {JO'(1')JO'(O)} ID) = V(1'), 
(26.108) 
where J: = VyyfLTtj'IjJj is the Noether cunent associated with the global SU(3) transfor-
mation of QCD acting on quarks. Taking the cunent in the color singlet state, as in Eg. 
(26.18), the potential is just what we calculated in Eq. (26.19): 
g; 
V(1') = - CF 41f1' 
(26.109) 
and everything is fine, at leading order. 
At next-to-leading order, we must include the vacuum polatization graphs, which gives 
2 
something proportional to 63 with the associated as In -,:, factor. Renormalizing the 
potential at one scale and evaluating at another would imply that (with n f = 0)

which is not gauge invariant! The origin of the problem is that J: is not conserved, only 
covariantly conserved, DfLJ: = O. So ofLJ: = -gsrbc AtJ~ =I- O. This was shown 
in Se tion 25.3 (where the matter cunent was called j~). In other words, while a current 
of electron ' makes a well-defined source for photons, a cunent of quarks does not make a 
well-defined source of gluons. 
Another way to understand the problem is to recall that the .B-fullction calculation 
required not just the vacuum polarization graphs but also the vertex rellormaJization and 
the quark self-energy. These last two diagrams are absent for a classical current J; not 
associated with propagating fields.

potential and evaluate it at large distances and strong coupling might give us insights into 
confinement. This led Wilson to propose a definition of a potential in terms of a Wilson 
loop, which we now discuss. 
26.7.2 Potential from Wilson loops 
We saw that (OIT {J~(r )J~ (O)} /0) is not gauge invariant and therefore does not provide 
a useful definition of a potential in QeD. We now argue that a better definition can be made 
through the expectation value of a Wilson loop:

Problems 
,--------------------------------------------------------------
expectation values of Wilson loops are very natural things to evaluate in lattice QCD. 
Wilson's idea was that if the potential grew with distance it should act like In(H'Joop) rv T R 
rather than In (VVioop ) rv ~. That is, the expectation value would be proportional to the area 
of the Wilson loop. 
In his paper [Wilson, 1974] Wilson was able to show analytically that on the lattice 
In(1YloOP) scales as the area of the loop at strong coupling. His argument was that, as 
gs -' 00, contributions that have links not compensated by links in the opposite direction 
vanish. Thus, the leading contribution comes from configurations in which the entire loop 
is tiled with plaquettes, as in Figure 26.2. This has been confirmed by numerical simulation 
[Gattringer and Lang, 2010]. Unfortunately, Wilson's argument holds equally well in any 
gauge theory, including QED. The challenge with this approach is to show that confinement 
persists in the continuum limit, that is, after the lattice spacing is removed. This remains 
an open question in QCD. 
By the way, there is indirect experimental evidence for the linear growth of the energy 
with separation. In the 1970s, by carefully examining the spectrum of various hadrons, peo-
ple found the interesting relation that the square of the mass of hadrons was proportional 
to their spin, m 2 rv J. This is known as Regge behavior. Such a spectrum is exactly what 
one would expect from a spinning string. Moreover, a string at constant tension also has 
energy that grows linearly with the length of the string. One can think of the string as a tube 
of chromoelectric flux with constant energy density between two quarks. This led people to 
postulate strings as a fundamental explanation of the strong force before QCD was estab-
lished and understood. Now we know that the linear growth with distance is explained by 
QCD, so fundamental strings are not needed. In the 2000s, string theory had a resurgence 
as a theory of strong interactions when it was found that it could quantitatively explain 
features of strongly coupled QCD through the AdS/CFT duality [Maldacena, 1998].

Why are the matrix elements for gluon scattering such a mess and the final answer so 
simple? The root of the problem is our insistence on manifest locality, In fact, the entire 
formalism of quantum field theory that we have developed so far is based on describing 

27.1 Spinor-helicity formalism 
,--------------------------------------------------------~-------
illteractions among particles in terms of local Lagrangians. In a local Lagrangian, inter-
actions involve non-negative powers of derivatives, such as (Jk(h (x) ... cPi n (x). While the 
local Lagrangian description has its advantages, such as manifest Lorentz invariance, it also 
has disadvantages. In Chapter 8, we encountered subtleties in trying to write a Lagrangian 
for a massless spin-1 particle that would only propagate the two physical degrees of 
freedom. We needed to have a redundancy of description, called gauge invariance, that 
established an equivalence among different components of the vector field AIL (x) in which 
tbese two polarizations were embedded. We also saw that we could integrate out this redun-
dancy directly at the level of the path integral, which, in the covariant R~ gauges, led to 
an additional complication, Faddeev-Popov ghosts. Even if we work in a gauge without 
ghosts, such as lightcone gauge, there is still an enormous redundancy built into the entire 
Feynman-diagram approach. The A2(JA interaction allows for mUltiple contractions, gen-
erating six terms in the Feynman rule, and the A4 vertex generates another six. That is why 
even the gg ----7 gg process above has so many pieces. For five gluon scattering, such as 
gg ----7 ggg, there are of order 10000 terms in the matrix element. For a cross section, the 
number of terms is unmanageable without a computer. With just a few more gluons in the 
final state, even a numerical approach becomes unrealistic. 
In this chapter, we describe an alternative approach to constructing amplitudes, using 
only physical on-shell external states. This approach exploits the spinor-helicity formalism. 
This formalism is based on the simple observation that spin-l fields transform in the (~, ~) 
representation of the Lorentz group, so that they are naturally represented as bispinors, 
fwi = a~aEIL (recall, aIL = (X,5) from Eq. (l0.56)). In this way, the redundancy of 
embedding a massless spin-l particle into a vector field AIL (x) can be avoided. It will take 
a bit of patience to get used to the notation (as it did for Dirac spinors). Once that is done, 
we will see some remarkable simplifications. For example, we will find that for gg ----7 gg 
there are only two non-vanishing amplitudes, which are 
Adding the appropriate prefactor, squaring and summing over spins and colors then leads 
to Eq. (27.3) almost effortlessly. 
Besides simplifying calculations, the spinor-helicity approach has led to a number 
of insights into gauge theories, some of which we will discuss (such as their unique-
ness), and others (such as dual conformal invariance, or the sense in which gravity = 
(gauge theory)2) that are still not completely understood. We make some comments on the 
outlook for this approach in Section 27.7. 
27.1 Spinor-helicity formalism 
Since momenta transform in the (~, ~) representation of the Lorentz group, in a sense they 
are more naturally described as bispinors, Faa, than as 4-vectors, FIL(x). To understand

Gluon scattering and the spinor-helicity formalism 
bispinors, we first recall some of the notation and results from Chapter 10. In Se 
tion 10.6.2, we introduced a notation for Weyl spinors where 1/Ja meant a left-hand c-
spinor, in the (~, 0) representation, and 1/;n (with a dot over the Greek index and a tild
Cd 
meant a right-handed spin or, in the (O,~) representation. We also showed that

(27.6) 
You should think of ca {3 and c"'/3 as raising and lowering spinor indices, as gl.w does 
for vector indices (although you have to be careful of the index ordering since ca (3 is 
antisymmetric). The metric with one up and one down index is ca(3c{3'Y = o~. 
Two useful relations that you derived in Problem 10.3 are

(27.7) 
(27.8) 
where a~an = (oa"', aan ) and iT~a = (ana, -ana). Each of these equations is 16 
relations, which can be easily verified by explicit computation. Equations (27.5), (27.7) 
and (27.8) are the only results we need from Section 10.6.2. 
When dealing with spinors, we found the inner product 1/Jx = ca{31/Ja(x)X{3(x) was 
natural. This satisfies x1/J = 1/Jx, since fermion fields 1/)0. (x) and X{3 (x) anticommute, and 
provides a concise notation, particularly in applications to supersymmetry. In this chapter, 
we are not interested in spinor fields, which transform in unitary irreducible infinite-
dimensional representations of the Poincare group. Instead, we are interested in constant 
spinors, which transform in finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group. These 
constant spinors can be real numbers, complex numbers or Grassmann numbers. For appli-
cations to QCD, we will take them to be real or complex. We will therefore define helicity 
spinors as real or complex doublets transforming in the (~, 0) or (0, ~) representations 
of the Lorentz group. To repeat, these are just two-component vectors of numbers, like 
external spin states Ua, not Grassmann numbers like 1/Ja. 
In terms of helicity spinors, it is natural to rewrite the antisymmetlic inner product, Eq. 
(27 .5), as

(27.9) 
With these inner products, whether the spinors are left- or right-handed is indicated by 
angle or square brackets, so we drop the tilde. Since A and X are commuting numbers, we 
have 
(AX) = -(XA), 
[AX] = -[XA],

which can be checked with Eqs. (27.7) and (27.8). These equations allows us to convert 
from the vector representation to the (~, ~) representation of the Lorentz group and back. 
It follows that 
(27.14) 
In the special case that the momentum is lightlike we find det (pCta) 
O. For gauge 
theories, which have massless momenta, this is a very important constraint. It holds even 
if the momenta are complex, which, as we will see, is a very useful generalization. 
A result from linear algebra is that any 2 x 2 matrix with zero determinant can be written 
as an outer product 
(27.15) 
for two vectors A ex and). a. To check that the right-hand side corresponds to a massless 
bispinor, write ACt = (:~) and).a = (b 1

which agrees with Eq. (27.19). 
We have some additional identities among spinor-helicity products that are useful to 
know. To derive these, it is simplest to take all momenta incoming, so that we can use 
L pr = O. Note that this means some of the energies must be negative and unphysical. In 
terms of helicity spinors, momentum conservation implies Lj A~ >-~ = 0, or

Thus, for example, ifthere were only 4-momenta we would have (13) [32] = -(14) [42].

anyone of them in terms of any two others: 
1) = (13) 2) _ (12) 3).

Tbis is known as the Schouten identity. 
27.1.2 Polarizations 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Tbe real power of the spinor-helicity formalism comes when talking about vector boson 
polarizations. Recall that physical polarizations satisfy E; EI" = -1 and Pl"EI" = O. For 
example, for a fixed momentum, the polarizations for positive and negative helicity are 
I" 
(E 
E) 
I" _ 
1 ( 
.) 
I" _ 1 ( 
.) 
p = 
,0,0, 
, 
E+ - J2 0,1,2,0, 
C 
- J2 0,1, -2,0 . 
(27.28) 
Note that, although E; EI" = -1, the helicity polarizations satisfy EI"EI" = 0, without the 
conjugation. Thus, just as Pl"pl" = 0 implies pI" has a decomposition into an outer product 
of spinors, the same holds for EI". Also Et C I" = -1. Keep in mind that we always have 
momenta incoming in this chapter, and as the momentum flips the helicity flips. For exam-
ple, M (-, -, +, +) describes 2 ~ 2 scattering where, after the outgoing momenta are 
reversed back to physical (positive energy) momenta, all the helicities are negative. 
To figure out how to decompose the polarizations, it is helpful to introduce in addition 
to pI" another lightlike 4-momentum rl" called the reference momentum. The reference 
momentum must not be aligned with pI" (r . p # 0), but is otherwise arbitrary. It will often 
be convenient to take rl" to be the momentum of another gluon in a scattering diagram, but 
we leave rl" general for now. 
Writing paCt = p)[P and raCt = r)[r, we have 
(27.29) 
We can then check that 
E;(r)· E;(r) = ~[E;(r)]Cta[E;(r)]aci = ~ [pr]~rp) tr{r](pr)[p} =-1 
(27.30) 
as desired. Similarly, since (pp) 
E±' P = O. 
[pp] = 0, it follows that E+ . E+ = C 
. C = 0 and 
The freedom of choice of reference momenta automatically implies the Ward identity. 
Note that since spinors are two-dimensional, any spinor can be written as .\) = 
)~~~p) -
)~~~ r), so we can only either shift r by something proportional to r or by something 
proportional to p. To see this, note that shifting r ~ r + p implies 
~c (r ) = p)[r ~ p)[(r + p) = p)[r + p)[p

Finally, recall from Chapter 8 that Lorentz transformations which hold a particular 
momentum fixed are called little-group transformations. In terms of helicity spinors, the 
entire set of transformations that preserve the momentum paC. = p) [p are rescalings: 
p) ---+ zp), 
1 
[p ---+ - [p, 
z 
(27.35) 
which can also be seen in the explicit decompositions 1Il Eq. (27.17). Thus, little-
group transformations must be rescalings of this form. There is a separate little-group 
transformation associated with each momentum. 
If we have a gluon with momentum pI" then its polarizations transform under the little 
group associated with p as

lOp r . 
(27.36) 
Note that the polarizations are independent of rescalings of spinors associated with the ref-
erence momentum. Since any gluon scattering amplitude can be written entirely in terms of 
inner products of spinors associated with the momenta in the problem, and since momenta 
and reference vectors are little-group invariant, the little-group scaling of any amplitude 
is determined solely by the external polarizations. This strongly constrains the form that a 
scattering amplitude can have, to all orders in perturbation theory.

Explicitly, the number of factors of i) and (i minus the number of factors of i] and [i in

but it could not be something like (12) (34) since that would scale incorrectly under the 
little group. 
27.1.3 Dirac spinors 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dirac spinors can also be handled smoothly with helicity spinors (although we will not 
be using them much in this chapter). Recall that Dirac spinors can be either left- or right-
banded. Of course, a physical state can only be left- or right-handed. Thus we can write 
left- and right-handed Dirac spinors (in the Weyl basis) as 
(27.38) 
Note that, for massless fermions, particles and antiparticles are represented by the same 
spin states (cf. Eqs. (11.22) and (11.23)). That is, connecting to our usual Dirac spinal' 
notation, Ip) = PL u(p) and p] = PRU(p) (for particles) or Ip) = PLV(p) and p] = PRV(p) 
(for antiparticles). We see that, using helicity spinors, p] and p) can be seamlessly treated 
as either Weyl or Dirac. 
The ,),-matrices in the Weyl basis are

2 ---> 2 scattering of gluons, all of which have positive helicity (with incoming momenta). 
Choose all the polarizations to have the same reference vector rf-L, which can be any random 
lightlike direction not aligned with any of the pr. With this choice, it follows from Eq. 
(27.33) that 
+ _) 
+( _ _ (rr/[ji] _ 
Ei (7 
. Ej 
7) -
(ri)(rj) - 0, 
(27.47) 
so that all the polarizations are orth gonal: r:t · t = O. Howcvcr every term in (he 
s-channel amplitude has some Ei . Ej factor, a 
an been . een immediately rrom the explicit 
expression in Eq. (27.2). Therefore M (1+ 2-1- 3+ 4+) = O. It is easy LO see in th 
same way that all terms in the i-channel u-channel and 4-poinl veltex- hannel have at 
least one pair of polarization vectors contracted. We c nclude that the u'ce-level amplitude 
for + + + + scattering vanishes identically. 
This result is actually quite general: 
Amplitudes with all positive (or all negative) helicities vanish at tree-level in QCD, for 
any number of legs. 
To see why, again choose rf-L to be different from all the momenta so that Et . EJ ::= O. 
The only thing a polarization can gel contracted with be ide ' another polarization is a 
momentum. But at tree-level, each vertex an COlllTibule at most one factor of momentum 
(none for the 4-point vertex). Since there are always fewer vertices than external lines, 

27.2 Gluon scattering amplitudes 
there Illust be a polarization contraction in each term in the answer, and thus the amplitude 
ust vanish. 
J1l What about having one negative helicity? Call the momentum of the negative helicity 
luon pi. Now choose the reference vector for the P;#l polarizations to be pi. In this case, 
~e still have 4 . Ej = 0 for i, j -# 1, but we also now have. 
E+ 1 . E-
7' = [iT'] (11) = 0 
2 () 
1 () 
(l'i) [11'] 
, 
(27.48) 
SO every possible polarization contraction still must vanish. This works for any number 
of gluons greater than three. Remember that the reference momentum could not have 
p 7'Jl = O. But for three gluons, Pl . P3 = ~(pl + P3)2 = ~p~ = 0, so this trick does 
n~t work. Of course, for three gluons, you cannot have non-trivial scattering anyway (at 
least with real momenta; with complex momenta the three-gluon scattering amplitude does 
not automatically vanish, as we will discuss below). 
In summary, we have found: 
Amplitudes with all but one positive (or all but one negative) helicity vanish at tree-level 
for any number of external legs greater than three. 
Beyond this, there is no general rule, and indeed amplitudes generally do not vanish. 
Finally, QCD is parity invariant, so amplitudes are the same if we flip all the helicities. 
Therefore: 
Amplitudes are invariant under parity, which flips all the helicities hi ---+ - hi. 
Thus, the leading non-vanishing amplitudes will have at least two negative and two positive 
helicities. Those with exactly two negative or exactly two positive helicities are called 
maximum helicity violating (MHV) amplitudes. 
27.2.1 Color factors 
To get the full answer for gluon scattering amplitudes we need to deal with color. First 
recall from Eq. (25.33) that the structure constants for SU(N) are related to the generators 
in the fundamental representation by 
(27.49) 
This equation lets us reduce products of r bc factors to traces over products of matrices. 
Another important equation from Chapter 25 is Eq. (25.34):

(27.51) 
while contracting with Ali and Bjk gives 
(27.52) 
These identities are great for simplifying color factors in gluon scattering amplitudes. They 
hold for any A and B. 
For example, the matrix element in Eq. (27.2) has color factor r be r de. This simpli_ 
fies to 
r be r de = - 4tr{ [Ta, Tb]T
C }tr{ [TC, Td]Te} 
= -2tr{ [Ta, T b] [TC, T d]} + ~ tr{[Ta, TbJ}tr{ [TC, TdJ} 
= -2tr{ [Ta, T b ] [TC, T d]} , 
(27.53) 
where Eq. (27.49) was used on the first line, Eq. (27.51) on the second line, and the cyclic 
property of the trace on the third. 
That the -k terms dropped out can be understood on more general grounds. The * 
terms come from the difference between U(N) = SU(N) x U(l) and SU(N). One can 
think of the U(N) as SU(N) plus a photon. However, if we calculated gluon scattering in 
U(N) we would get the same result as in SU(N), since the photon has no self-interactions 
and gluons are not charged. This is why the -k correction in Eq. (27.51) drops out, a 
phenomenon sometimes called photon decoupling. Similarly, a product of color factors in 
any tree-level gluon scattering diagram will reduce to one big single trace over fundamental 
generators. At loop level, or when fermions are involv~d, SU(N) and U(N) are different, 
so photon decoupling is a tree-level trick. 
At tree-level, where SU(N) and U(N) are equivalent, there is an appealing graphical 
representation for the color connections in gluon scattering diagrams: U(N) has N 2 gen-
erators and is equivalent to a bifundamental representation, N x N. Thus, each gluon has 
a color and an anticolor, like red anti-blue (RB) or green anti-green (GG). It is then easy 
to draw the color flow for gluons by representing them with double lines, as in Figure 27.1. 
This is known as 't Hooft double-line notation ['t Hooft, 1974]. By the way, one can use 
double-line notation beyond tree-level as well. In fact, it is particularly useful for studying 
SU(N) gauge theories in the limit N ----) 00 , where SU(N) is equivalent to U(N) even at 
loop level. 
Once products of jabc factors are reduced to products of traces over fundamental gener-
ators, we can simplify those products using Eqs. (27.51) and (27.52). For example, setting 
A = B = ] in Eq. (27.52) gives

27.3 99 ---+ 99 
Now let us work out the cross section for 99 --) 99. We already know that only the MHV 
amplitudes are non-vanishing. We will actually only have to compute one MHV amplitude, 
M(l-, 2-,3+,4+), with the others related by crossings. 
As a reminder, in this chapter we take all momenta incoming and order the momenta 
clockwise. We take t = (PI + p4)2, U = (PI + P3)2 and s = (PI + P2)2 so that s + 
t + U = O. Note that these definitions are different from those used for two incoming and 
two outgoing momenta (cf. Section 7.4.1). Since all momenta are incoming, the physical 
process 99 --) 99 with all negative helicities is described by M(1-2-3+4+). 
We start by working out M(1-2-3+4+). We choose the reference momentum for CI 
and C2 to be r = P4 and the reference momentum for C3 and C4 to be Pl. Then the only 
polarization contraction that does not vanish is C2' C3. Also, we now have CI . P4 = C2' P4 = 
C3 . PI = C4 . PI = 0 as well as Ci . Pi = O. All of these constraints vastly simplify the 
answer. 
First of all, consider the diagram with the 4-point vertex. There are no momentum factors 
in the vertex, so the diagram can only give products of contractions of polarizations, such 
as (E2 . c3) (cI . c4). But since only one contraction, C2' C3, is non-zero, this diagram cannot 

546 
Gluon scattering and the spinor-helicity formalism 
----
contribute. Indeed, it is not hard to see that diagrams involving the 4-point vertex can ne ver 
contribute to MHV amplitudes. 
Next, we look at the s-channel diagram. Assuming only that Ci . Pi = 0, it is

For the (- , -, +, +) helicity choice, only the term contracting E2 with E3 can survive

(27.60) 
Now we put everything in terms of 0 by using various relations. For example, momentum 
conservation, Eq. (27.25), implies (12) [23] = - (14) [43], (PI + P2)2 = (P3 + P4)2 implies 
[34](43) = [21] (12), and (PI + P4)2 = (P2 + P3)2 implies [14](41) = [23] (32) . Then we 
can simplify the result as 
M (1-T3+4+) = -2 2rberde (21)[34]2 ([14](41)) ( (12)[21]) ( _ (12)[23])

which is a remarkably simple answer. It is a special case of a Parke-Taylor formula, as we 
will discuss shortly. 
As a check, we can look at the little-group scaling. There are two more spinors for each 
of the negative helicity gluons (l and 2) in the numerator than in the denominator, and 
two more spinors for each of the positive helicity gluons in the denominator than in the 
numerator. 
Next, consider the t-channel diagram, which is 2 f-7 4 and b f-7 d from the s-channel: 

27.3 gg -t gg 
~---------------------------------------------------
With our polarization choice, f1 . P4 = f4 . PI = fl . f4 = 0 and therefore 
Mt(rT3+4+) = O. 
(27.63) 
Finally, consider the u-channel diagram. This is 2 f-+ 3 and b f-+ C from the 3-channel: 
X [(E1 . E3)(P1 - P3)'" + 2f~(p3 . (1) - 2f'((p1 . (3)] 
X [(f2' (4)(P2 - P4)'" + 2f~(p4' (2) -
2f~(p2' (4)] . 
(27.64) 
This does not vanish but gives

(27.67) 
To get the cross section, we have to perform the color sums and square the matrix ele-

With this answer, it is not hard to complete the full cross section calculation. Since 
only the MHV channels do not vanish, and each one is gauge invariant by itself, the 
will all be given by some crossing of this result. For example, M(r2+3-4+) is give~ 
by M (1-2-3+4+) with S +-7 u. The six non-vanishing amplitudes correspond to the six

This final form is the standard way gg --+ gg is presented for QCD. 
27.4 Color ordering 
As we have seen in the gg --+ gg example, crossing relations can be extremely helpful 
in gluon scattering. For multi-gluon amplitudes, with n > 4 gluons, crossings can be 
complicated, so it is worth understanding how crossings work in general. The first step is 
to separate the color from the kinematics. 
Define a color-stripped amplitude as the part of the amplitUde with the color factor 
stripped off. The Feynman rules for computing color-stripped amplitUdes are the same as 
the regular QCD Feynman rules, but without a V2igsr bc factor. For example, for the 
four-gluon amplitude, the color-stripped s-channel amplitude is 
M s(1234) = 2
18 [(Cl . c2)(Pl - P2)'-' + 2E~(p2 . Cl) - 2ci(Pl . c2)] 
X[(c3 ' c4)(P3 - P4)'-' + 2c~(p4
' 103) - 2cj(P3' 104)]' 
(27.75) 

549 
27.4 Color ordering 
---------------------------~----------------...... 
tIere the numbers 1234 have implicit he1icities associated with each gluon. Note that Ms 
js antisymmetric under interchange of 1 f-4 2 or 3 f-4 4, so 
(27.76) 
AlsO, Ms(1234) = Ms(3412). 
The color factor for the s-channel diagram can be written in terms of single traces, using 
the SU(N) tricks from Section 27.2.1: 
f12a j34a = -2tr{ [1,2] [3, 4]} = -2 [tr{1234} - tr{2134} - tr{1243} + tr{2143}]. 
(27.77) 
This is a sum of four terms that is anti symmetric under 1 f-4 2 or 3 f-4 4. Thus, the full 
s_channel amplitude for M s (1234) can be written as a sum of terms that have the gluons 
ordered the same way in the color factor and the color-stripped amplitude: 
Ms(1234) = 4g; [tr{1234}Ms(1234) + tr{2134}M s(2134) 
+ tr{1243}Ms(1243) + tr{2143}M s (2143)] . (27.78) 
Note that all the terms in the sum have the same sign. 
The t-channel color-stripped amplitude is just the 2 f-4 4 cross of the s-channel one: 
(27.79) 
Similarly, the u-channel is a 2 f-4 3 cross: 
(27.80) 
Keep in mind, in these crossings, the polarizations stick with the momenta. For example, 
M s(1-2-3+4+) = M t (1-4+3+2-) =J M t (1-4-3+2+). Both t- and u-channels also 
have four terms in the color trace with appropriate signs, so the full amplitude can be 
written as a sum of single trace color factors and color-stripped amplitudes with positive 
signs. 
The result is that the full amplitude M(1234) = Ms(1234) + M t (1234) + Mu(1234) 
has twelve terms, four each from the s, t, u channels, all of which can be written as 
tr{ijkl}Ms(ijkl). The sum can be simplified further, since not all the color factors are 
independent due to the cyclic property of the trace tr{ 1234} = tr{ 2341 }. It is helpful to 
pair up terms, so that 
= tr{1234}M(1234),

Gluon scattering and the spinor-helicity formalism

is known as the color-ordered partial amplitude. We can then write the four-gluo 
scattering amplitude as 
n 
M (1234) = 4g; L tr {la(2) a(3)a( 4)} M (la(2)a(3) a( 4)) , 
UES 3 
(27.83) 
where S3 is the permutation group of {2, 3, 4}. Sometimes this group is written as S3 "" 
S4/Z4, with Z4 referring to the cyclic permutations. 
Note that the two diagrams that contribute to the color-ordered partial amplitude are the 
planar ones. In the double-line notation, the diagrams that are non-planar are suppreSsed 
by factors of -b and drop out of tree-level amplitudes for SU(N). Thus, at tree-level, We 
will always be able to express gluon scattering in terms of sums of planar diagrams. In 
fact, the decomposition into partial amplitudes and single traces works for any number of 
gluons, at tree-level. The generalized formula is simply 
M(12 ... n) = - 2 (v'2i9sr-
2 L tr{a(1)a(2) ... a(n)}M(a(1)a(2) ... a(n)). 
uESn/Zn 
(27.84) 
The general definition of M(12. " n) is the sum over all planar color-stripped graphs with 
a given ordering of the external momenta. This equation can be derived by using the cyclic 
property of the trace to uncross all the crossed diagrams (see Problem 27.3). Although it 
should not be obvious at this point why one would want to express an amplitUde in terms 
of M(12 .. . n), it turns out that M(12 . .. n) can be remarkably simple. 
For example, consider the MHV partial amplitude M(1-2 -3+4+) for gg -t gg. 
Plugging Eqs. (27.61) and (27.63) into Eq. (27.82), this partial amplitude is 
~( __ + +) _ 
(12)4 
M 1 2 3 4 
-
(12)(23)(34)(41) 
because M t (1 - 2- 3+4+) = O. We can also compute 
M (1 - 2+T 4+) = Ms (r2+3 - 4+) + M t (1- 2+3-4+) 
= Mu(1-T2+4+) + M t (1-3-2+4+) . 
(27.85) 
(27.86) 
Again M t (1-3-2+4+) vanishes, and we computed M u (1 - 2- 3+4+) in Eq. (27.66). So 
we have 
(27.87) 
which is remarkably similar to M(1-2-3+4+). In fact, an amazing feature of gluon 
scattering is that the color-ordered MHV amplitude for any number of gluons is 
(27.88) 

27.5 Complex momenta 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
where j and k are the two negative helicity gluons. This is known as the Parke-Taylor 
formula. It is an amazing result that shows that scattering amplitudes in QeD have a lot 
J110re symmetry to them than you might guess from looking at the Feynman rules. You are 
encouraged to verify that the Parke-Taylor formula reproduces the full gg ---> gg scattering 
aJ1lplitude at tree-level in Problem 27.2. 
As a highly non-trivial example, it is now quite easy to calculate the five-gluon scattering 
cross section (Problem 27.6). For five gluons, everything but the MHV amplitudes vanish, 
sa as with four gluons there is only one independent amplitude to compute, and it is given 
by the Parke-Taylor formula. If you tried to do five-gluon scattering with polarization 
vectors and momenta, it would have 10 000 terms. Using the spinor-helicity formalism, the 
calculation can be done by hand. 
27.5 Complex momenta 
We have seen that helicity spinors can be used to simplify Feynman diagrams. But so far, 
we have only used spinors for the external momenta and polarizations. We still have to 
compute the Feynman diagrams using the vertices from the Lagrangian. Of course, the 
spinor-helicity formalism is still an enormous help, but it would be nice to be able to apply 
the helicity formalism to internal lines too. This is not so simple, since we needed p2 = 0 to 
write the momentum in terms of spinors, but p2 =1= 0 in general on an internal line. In fact, 
there is a procedure, not using Feynman diagrams, that uses only on-shell internal states 
for which the helicities are also + or - For this to work, we need to consider complex 
momenta. With complex momenta, the 3-point vertex will not identically vanish if the 
three momenta are on-shell. As we will see, the 4-point and higher-order amplitudes can 
be built up from the 3-point amplitude, and then the limit of real momenta can be taken. 
27.5.1 3-point amplitude 
Rather than compute the 3-point amplitUde from the Feynman rules, let us just figure out 
what the most general possible amplitude could be: 
= ? 
(27.89) 
It must depend on the three polarization vectors Ei and the three momenta Pi, or 
equivalently on the spinors [1, [2, [3 and (1, (2, (3. Momentum conservation is 
1)[1 + 2)[2 + 3)[3 = 0 . 
(27.90) 
551 

552 
Gluon scattering and the spinor-helicity formalism 
---
Contracting this on the left with (1 or (2 gives the two equations 
(12)[2 = - (13)[3 , 
(21)[1 = -(23)[3 . 
(27.91) 
These equations imply either that (12) = 0, in which case (13) = (23) = 0 also , Ot 
that all the [i are proportional to each other, in which case [12] = [13] = [23] 
=::: 0 
Thus, the answer must be a function of only (ij ) or only [ij]. In the limit of real moment~ 
[ij] = (j i ) *, so all inner products vanish, which is a complicated way of saying that 
momentum conservation implies you cannot have non-trivial 3-point functions for real 
momenta. 
Now let us use little-group scaling. If we take 1 + then the total power of [1 minus the 
power of (1 must be 2 (see Section 27.1.2); for 1- it must be - 2. The same argument 
applies for the other momenta. Thus, for + + +, the most general amplitude is 
M (1 a+2b+3c+) = Cabc [12] [23] [31J 
c ube 
1 
or 
(12) (23) (31) , 
(27.92) 
where Cabc is some color structure. The second form diverges instead of going to 
zero in the limit of real momenta, therefore the first form is the only possibility. Since 
M (123) has mass dimension 1 (s e for example, lhc di cussion Ln Section 21.2.1) and 
[12] [23] [31] has mass dimension 3, c uhe must have dimcn .i n - 2. Thu , if we consider 
only renormalizable theories with dLmen ionles coupling the only s juLion is '(I,b = O. 
Next, consider the MHV amplitude. Again, there are only two po ibil ities allowed 
by little-group scaling. Since (12\iWPl) diverges in the limit of real momenta, the only 
possibility is 
(27.93) 
Similarly, 
(27.94) 
Now, we are calculating the amplitude for identical particles, which must be bosons 
since they have spin 1. Thus, the answer must be symmetric under interchange of two 
particles. This is true even for the crossed processes with 3 f--7 1. But the spinor products 
in this formula are totally antisymmetric. Thus, cabe must be totally antisymmetlic under 
the interchange of any two indices. 
For real on-shell momenta the 3-point function vanishes. But we can use the form of the 
complex 3-point function to write down a local interaction (with complex x ll ), then take 
the limit of real Xll to determine the unique local interaction with real fields. In that way. 
we can say things about real momenta using complex momenta as a tool.

27.5 Complex momenta 
------------------------------------------------------------------
where F scales as [1\11]-4 by dimensional analysis. Since F scales as an inverse power of 
rDass, it must have a pole as a function of some of the external momenta. To constrain F 
we use a very general result from Section 24.3: in a unitary theory, poles in the S-matrix 
con'espond to the exchange of on-shell intermediate states. 
For example, let us suppose the pole is in the s-channel. Then we should be able to 
describe the process through 12 ---+ P and P ---+ 34 with p 2 rv O. That is, 
(27.96) 
The requirement that P be nearly on-shell implies that the amplitude should factorize into 
the product of 3-point amplitudes that communicate through the exchange of a gluon of 
some helicity h = ±. 
The gluon is massless, so its propagator must be -jh(jab summed over helicities, which 
becomes singular as p 2 ---+ O. Let us define pI" = -pi -
p~ = p~ + p~. Since P is 
incoming for the left vertex, the 1 - 2- P- amplitude vanishes, and we need the helicity 
of P to be positive on the left. The helicity must therefore be negative on the right. Since 
the momentum is incoming in the left vertex, it is outgoing on the right. The spinors for 
- P can always be chosen to be related to the spinors for P by a factor of i. That is, 
(-P)) = iP), (-P)] = iP], (( -P) = i(P and [( -P) = i[P. Thus we find 
lim sM(la-2b-3c+4d+) = _cabeccde 
(12)3 
[34]3 
(27.97) 
8-->0 
(2P)(Pl) [3P] [P4] 
Using (2P) [P4] = -(21) [14]- (22) [24] and [3P] (PI) = [33] (31) + [34] (41) this reduces 
to 
Thus, 
lim stFabcd(s,t,u) = _cabeccde. 
8-->0 
(27.98) 
(27.99) 
Note that there are many different points in complex spinor space with p 2 = O. For 
example, if pI" = p~ + pt then p 2 = (34) [43] so p 2 = 0 if either (34) = 0 or [34] = O. 
Since we have pulled out a factor of [34]2 in Eq. (27.95), we should set (34) = O. This has 
no effect on the s-channel factorization limit, since (34) never appeared, but is important 
for the t-channel. 
For the t-channel, pI" = pi + p~ = -p~ -
p~. There are two possibi lities for the helicity 
of P. The two amplitudes are

(27. 101) 
To simplify this further, we have to be careful about which point in complex momentum 
space we are closing in on to take p 2 = O. Since p 2 = (41)[14], we can either have 
(41) = 0 or [14] = 0; either way one of the terms vanishes and not the other. It turns OUt 
that both terms simplify to the same form c ade Cbce ~, and thus we have 
lim tsFabcd (s, t, u) = c ade Cbce . 
t->O 
(27.102) 
Finally, the u-channel amplitude is the same as for the t-channel with 3 -
4 and 
c ~ d. So, 
lim USFabcd(s, t, u) = c acecbde. 
u->O 
(27.103) 
Unitarity implies that the 4-point function should have these single poles in the s, t 
and u channels. What kind of function can possibly satisfy Eqs. (27.99), (27.102) and 
(27.103) and have only single poles? First of all, since s + t + u = 0, there is only one 
independent dimensionless ratio we can construct, which we can take to be t or t. Since 
F has dimension - 4, we can always write 
(27 .104) 
for some function r bcd. For example, ~ = (S~t )2 := -It (2 + t + ~ ) - J. It is slightly 
more convenient to write 
Fabcd(S,t,U) = :tffbCd(D + t~ffbCd(¥). 
(27.105) 
Next, let u write II and fz as Taylor series: 
Fabcd(s, t, u) = s~ f a~bcd (~r + t~ f b~bcd (¥ r 
n =O 
n=O 
(27.106) 
We know negative powers of t cannot appear in the first sum, since otherwise there would 
be a -f.x or stronger singularity in the s-channel. Similarly, avoiding ~ or stronger poles 
excludes negative powers of 't in the second sum. 
Now, the s ~ 0 limit, Eq. (27.99), implies aobcd = _ c abec cde . Similarly, the u -+ 0 
limit, in which s ~ -t, implies bObcd = _ c acecbde from Eq. (27.103). Finally, we take 
the t ~ 0 limit in which u ~ -. and use Eq. (27.102) to get 
00

cadecbce = ~~ tsFabcd(s, t, u ) = ~~ 2: (a~bcd - (- It b~bCd) (D

For this not to be singular, we need a~bcd = (-1) n b~bcd for all n > O. Then

27.6 On-shell recursion 
------------------------------------------------------------------
which is the Jacobi identity. Therefore we conclude: 
Gauge theories based on Lie algebras are the unique interacting theories with massless 
spin-l particles. 
The only thing we used in this proof is that a pole corresponds to a nearly on-shell particle, 
which is a general requirement of unitarity. 
The same argument also goes through for massless particles of other spins. For spin 
0, there is no interesting constraint. For spin 2, it leads to C abc being constant. For 
spin 3, there is no solution. These are the same results we found using the soft limits 
in problem 9.3, using the same assumptions. Both derivations use Lorentz invariance, as 
manifested through little-group scaling, and both use the existence of a pole to factorize 
the amplitude. 
27.6 On-shell recursion 
One of the most important uses of complex momenta is to let us evaluate integrals using 
residues. Consider a general tree-level n-gluon scattering amplitude. Let us shift two of the 
spinors for gluons i and j as 
[i = [i + z[j, 
])=j)-zi), 
i) = i), 
[] = [j, 
(27.110) 
where z is some complex number. The momenta then shift to 
Pi = i)[i + z i)[j, 
Pj = j)[j - z i)[j, 
(27.111) 
which preserves masslessness, PI = PJ 
= 
0, and overall momentum conservation, 
Pi + Pj = Pi + Pj· 
With this shift, we can think of the amplitude as an analytic function of z, M(z), with 
the physical amplitude given by M(O). Now, if M(z) ---70 at z ---7 00 (that's a big if), then 
f 
dz 1 
~ 1 
0= -. -M(z) = M(O) + ~ -Res(M(z*)) , 
2Jr~ z 
z* 
poles z* 
(27.112) 
which lets us solve for the physical answer M (0) in terms of the location of the poles. 
Where can poles in M(z) come from? Since momentum proportional to z is added 
and subtracted from two external lines, we can trace z through the diagram: it comes in 
from gluon i and out through gluon j. So only propagators along this line can possibly 
contribute poles in M(z). Say a propagator with a z in it has momentum P!1(z). The 
pole is at P2 = 0, which puts this line on-shell, splitting the diagram into two on-shell 
subdiagrams. Thus, each pole lets us split the diagram in two. That the amplitude is the 
sum over such poles implies that it has an expression in terms of lower-order on-shell 
amplitudes. Thus, we will be able to build up tree-level amplitudes recursively. 
To be more specific, focus on a single pole associated with a nearly on-shell intermediate 
gluon with momentum P. Order the gluons 1 ... n with gluons a . .. b to the right of the P

nelicity h of the internal now on-shell particle with momentum pJ.L must be summed over. 
Note that, to be consistent with our convention that momenta are always incoming, h must 
flip from the left to the right. 
The BCFW formula requires the z ---+ 00 limit to be well behaved. This is almost always 
true, except for some choices of i and j. It is easiest to check if we already know the 
answer. For example, recall the MHV color-ordered partial amplitude for 99 ---+ gg: 
_

(12)3 
M(1 2 3 4 ) -

(27.118) 
Let us try i = 1 and j = 2. Then the only angle shift is 2) ---+ 2) - z1). So, (12) ---+ (12), 
(23) ---+ (23) - z(13) and (41) ---+ (41), and at large z this amplitude vanishes as ~ 
as desired. For the amplitude not to vanish as z ---+ 00, (12) would have to shift, which 
we could only get with i = 3 or i = 4 and j = 1 or j = 2. For i = 3 and j = 2, 
we find (12) ---+ (12) - z(13), (23) ---+ (23), (34) ---+ (34) and (41) ---+ (41) so the 
amplitude blows up as z3 . The general rule for 2 ---+ 2 is that the helicity combinations 
(i, j) = (+, +) , (-, -) or (-, +) are good, while (+, - ) is bad. 
Intriguingly, while BCFW works for gauge theories, it does not work for scalar field 
theories. For example, in a simple scalar field theory, such as ¢4 theory, there are tree-level 
amplitudes that are just constants. If the amplitude is momentum independent, shifting 
the momentum introduces no z dependence, and therefore amplitudes will not vanish at 
z = 00. Thus, BCFW implies that gauge theories are in a way simpler than scalar theories 
because they can be constructed from sewing together lower point amplitudes. Amplitudes 
for the exchange of spin-2 particles vanish even faster as z ---+ 00 than for gauge theories 
(for certain helicity choices). Thus, in a way, gravity is the simplest theory of them all. 
27.6.1 Example 
As an example, let us work out .M (1- 2- 3+ 4 +) using BCFW. There are still two diagrams 
contributing to this partial amplitude, s- and t-channel, but now we will get the answer 
from the 3-point veltex without using the Lagrangian. We take i = 1 and j = 4, which is a 
( - , +) combination and so has good behavior as z ---+ 00. For there to be a pole these have 
to be on opposite sides of the internal line. So the t-channel diagram has no poles and does 
not contribute. The s-channel diagram has pJ.L = -pr -
p~, so

with [1 = [1 + zg,4[4 and 4) = 4) - zg,41). Since M(1-2- p-) vanishes, we must have 
h = +. Then,

M(l 2 3 4 ) = (12)(23)(34)(41)' 
(27.123) 
This is identical to the MHV amplitude we computed in Section 27.3. Here we computed it 
without Feynman rules, just using the 3-point MHV amplitude, which is fixed by symmetry 
(little-group scaling) and sewing things together with scalar propagators, (Pa + ... + Pb )- 2. 
One reason BCFW is so efficient is that there is often only one diagram for each step in 
the recursion. This is always true for MHV amplitudes. For example, for the 7-point MBV 
amplitude, let us take i = 1 and j = 7, so that [1 = [1 + z[7 and 7) = 7) - zl). Then,

(27.124) 
with only one non-vanishing amplitude present in each step. In this way, one can 
use BCFW to prove the Parke-Taylor formula for tree-level MHV amplitudes (see 
Problem 27.7).

flaying two spinors makes things much easier. 
Little-group scaling for spin 2 implies that the 3-point amplitude must be

This equation makes graviton scattering amplitudes appear to be the square of the corre-
sponding gauge-theory amplitudes. This actually seems to be true in a certain sense quite 
generally, which is a very profound result that is not quite understood. 
As an additional bonus, some symmetries become clear from the description of an ampli-
tude in terms of spinors instead of through a Lagrangian. The most well-known one is 
called dual conformal invariance. Dual conformal invariance is a symmetry of amplitudes 
in certain very symmetric theories when momenta are replaced by momenta differences 
x; = p; - P;+l' It is part of a larger infinite-dimensional symmetry called Yangian 
invariance, which includes conformal invariance and special conformal invariance. 
Due to the accumulation of surprising theoretical data (like the Parke-Taylor formula, 
Eq. (27.88), or dual-conformal invariance) on the remarkable properties of scattering 
amplitudes, it is reasonable to expect that the simplest way to describe fundamental physics 
may not be with quantum field theory. For example, we may need to move away from the 
formulation of a theory in terms of a local Lagrangian, £(x), to one where locality is 
rather an emergent property. Of course, quantum field theory is likely to remain the most 
efficient tool for calculating scattering amplitudes with few final-state particles at low-loop 
order, much like Newtonian mechanics is still the tool of choice for computing the effect 
of macroscopic forces on macroscopic objects. However, quantum field theory may well 
be a certain limit of a more general theory, as classical mechanics is a limit of quantum 
mechanics. Formulating such a general theory based on purely theoretical data (as opposed 
to experimental data, as was the case for quantum mechanics) is a formidable but perhaps 
not insurmountable challenge.

p2 = (23) [32] = (14) [41] one also must choose (23) = 0 or [23] = O. Can you 
derive any additional constraints on the form of the amplitude from considering all 
four possible combinations, such as (23) = [14] = 0 or (23) = (14) = O? 

spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most important concepts in quantum field 
theory. The distinction between spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking is that with 
pontuneou symmetry breaking tile Lagrangian is invariant under the symmetry, but the 
ground late of the t.he ry i nol. With explicit symmetry breaking, there was never an 
exact . ymmetry to begin with. One u ually a sociates spontaneous symmetry breaking 
with phase transitions. The amazing thing about spontaneous symmetry breaking is that 
one can say a tremendous amount about the broken phase with an effective field theory 
whose only input is the symmetry that was broken - no detailed microscopic description is 
needed. We will see a number of examples in this chapter. 
You are undoubtedly already familiar with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the con-
text of felTomagnetic materials, such as iron. The magnetic moment of such a material 
---> 
can be represented by a field !'vI (x) related to the local direction the spins are pointing. At 
high temperature, the en tropic term in the free energy, F = E - T S, dominates the ener-
---> 
getic one and lvl (x) points in random directions at each point x. When a ferromagnetic 
material is cooled below its Curie temperature Tc (Tc = 1032 K for iron), the energetic 
contribution to the free energy, which is lower when neighboring atoms are aligned, starts 
to dominate. As the temperature is lowered, domains with aligned spins start to grow, and 
long-range order emerges. The typical size of these domains is known as the correlation 
---> 
length, ~. For T < T C it is helpful to write M (x) = i1 + iJ (x), where i1 is the expectation 
---> 
value of AI in the vacuum (T = 0), and iJ are the excitations around this minimum. At 
high temperature, the theory has a rotational symmetry (no direction is distinguished), but 
at low temperature, this symmetry is spontaneously broken, since i1 points in some partic-
ular direction. The field, iJ(x), that encodes excitations around the vacuum encodes spin 
waves whose quanta are called Goldstone bosons. 
In this chapter, we will see that spontaneous symmetry breaking has different impli-
cations depending on the nature of the symmetry. The simplest symmetries are discrete, 
such as a Z2 symmetry, ¢(x) ---7 -¢(x). For discrete symmetries, spontaneous symmetry 
breaking looks a lot like explicit symmetry breaking. On the other hand, if the symmetry 
is a continuous global symmetry, such as ¢ (x) ---7 eiO:¢(x) for any constant 0: E JR, the 
breaking of the symmetry automatically implies the existence of long-range correlations 
and associated massless particles. This is Goldstone's theorem, and the massless particles 
are the Goldstone bosons. If the symmetry is gauged, as for ¢ (x) ---7 eio:Cxl¢(x) with 
an associated massless gauge field AIL (x), then in the broken phase the gauge boson will 
acquire a mass. This is known as the Higgs mechanism. In this chapter, we will consider 
all of these cases, derive some important results about spontaneously broken theories, and 
show how to consistently quantize the theories in the broken phase.

Te, then near Te one should be able to write m2 (T) = c(T - Te) for some constant c. To 
derive this, we just have to assume that the full potential from the microscopic description 
can be Taylor expanded in T - Te. 
If m 2 (T) = c(T - Tc), then for T > Te the mass term has the right sign, 
m 2 > 0, and the Lagrangian describes an ordinary scalar field theory. For T < Te, 
however, m 2 < O. Then the extremum at ¢ = 0 is a local maximum of the potential 
V = -Lint = ~m2¢2 + fi¢4 instead of a minimum, and is unstable. Having a nega-
tive mass-squared implies that a momentum is spacelike. Spacelike momenta can be used 
to communicate faster than the speed of light, and therefore negative mass-squared par-
ticles are called tachyons (raxva is the Greek prefix for "fast"). Of course, since the 
microscopic theory is causal, there should be nothing non-casual about the effective theory 
above or below the phase transition, but this is hard to see by expanding around ¢ = O. 
The problem is that for T < Te the field ¢ cannot be treated as a small excitation. In order 
to have a perturbative quantum field theory, we have to consider excitations around the true 
vacuum. 
For T < Te , we replace m2 --4 _m2 so that m2 is still positive and the Lagrangian 
becomes

,------------------------------------------------------- r-----.. 
When a constant value ¢ = v satisfies the classical equations of motion £' [v] = 0, the 
classical expectation is that the field should be at this value over all space. If we take the 
classical limit of the quantum theory, by taking It ---) 0, we find 
(D I¢I D) = lim jv¢e Hd4X£ [¢l¢ = v. 
(28.4) 
/t->O 
Bere, It ---) ° has forced the path integral to be dominated by the tmionary point of the 
action, letting us ignore fiuctuali n and evaluale the integral exactly. Thu , we can identify 
thiS classical expectation with a quanLum vacuum expectation value v = (D I¢I D), eval-
uated at tree-level. We will discuss how quantum cOlTections make (DI ¢ID) differ from the 
stationary point of the action in Chapter 34. 
Thinking in terms of vacuum expectation values lets us understand what happens to a 
syrrunetry when it is spontaneously broken. The original Lagrangian was invariant under 
the Z2 symmetry ¢ ---) -¢. Since (D I¢ I D) = ±V 617/ are both minima, there must be two 
different vacua: ID+) with (D+I¢I D+) = v
617t and ID_) with (D_ I¢ I D_ ) = -v 617t. 
Since the Z2 symmetry takes ¢ ---) - ¢, it must take ID+) <--+ ID_ ) as well. The two 
possible vacua for the theory are equivalent, but one has to be chosen. This is just like 
having to choose a direction for the magnetization of a felTomagnet in the example from 
the introduction. 
The new Lagrangian is not invariant under ¢ ---) - ¢, so it seems the Z2 symmetry might 
have disappeared altogether. Actually, the Lagrangian is still invariant under the Oliginal 
¢ -7 - ¢ symmetry, because it acts on ¢ as ¢ -> - ¢ - 2v. So the symmetry is still 
there, it is just realized in a funny way. This is a general feature of spontaneously broken 
symmetries: the vacuum breaks them, but they are not actually broken in the Lagrangian, 
just hidden, and often realized only in a nonlinear way. 
28.2 Spontaneous breaking of continuous 
global symmetries 
In Section 3.3, we derived that the existence of a continuous global symmetry implies a 
Noether CUlTent JI-'(x) which is conserved, 0l-'JI-' = 0, on the equations of motion. This is 
true both in the classical and in the quantum theory. In the quantum theory, the conserved 
charge, 
Q = j d3xJO(x) = j d
3x ~ 
:¢~ a:::, 
(28.5) 
is an operator, since the fields are operators. Recalling the canonically conjugate fields 
7fm = o~~ and the canonical commutation relations[¢n(.i), 7rm (Y)] = i53(x - Y)5nm , we 
then find that 
[Q, ¢n(:Y)] = L j d3x [7rm (.i), ¢nW')] 5¢;~X) = _ia¢~Y),

so that Q generates the symmetry transformation. Also, since the charge is conserved . 
commutes with the Hamiltonian: [H, Q] = iotQ = O. 
' It 
The operator Q conesponds to a conserved charge no matter what vacuum We eXPa 
around. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occms, by definition, if the symmetric vacuu nd 
with QID)sym = 0, is unstable and the true (stable) vacuum is charged, QID) # O. If t~' 
vacuum has energy Eo, that is HID) = Eo I D), then 
e 
HQID) = [H, Q]ID) + QH ID) = EoQ In) 
(28.7) 
and therefore the state Q ID) is degenerate with the ground state. 
Now we can always construct states of 3-momentum pfrom the vacuum via 
In(p)) = -;i J 
d3x eip.x Jo(x)lr1) , 
(28.8) 
which have energy E(P) + Eo. Here, F is a constant with dimension of mass and the - 2· 
factor has been added for later convenience. Since In(O)) = -]iQID) has energy Eo, w~ 
can conclude that E(P) --> 0 as p --> 0 for these states. Therefore, the states In) must 
satisfy a massless dispersion relation. This is Goldstone's theorem: 
Spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries implies the exis-
tence of massless particles. 
The states In(p)) are known as Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem is very general. 
Sometimes it is useful to construct the Goldstone bosons from the vacuum using a Noether 
current. Often it is easier just to locate the Goldstone bosons in the broken phase of the 
theory through some other means. 
Multiplying Eq. (28.8) by \n(q)1 and integrating over J cg:f3 eip.g gives 
(28.9) 
where the normalization of one-particle states \n(q) In(p')) = 2wp(2n )383 (p - k) has been 
used. The Lorentz-invariant version of this equation, \n(q)IJ,..(y)ID) = iq,..FeiifiJ, is a 
useful way to identify a particle in the spectrum as the Goldstone boson, as we will see 
below. 
28.2.1 Linear sigma model 
The simplest relativistic theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuouS 
global symmetry has a complex scalar field with Lagrangian 
(28.10) 
Note that the terms here are canonically normalized for a complex field. This theory has a 
global U(l) symmetry ¢(x) --> eiD:¢(x) for constant Q. For m 2 > 0 the theory is unstab~e 
around ¢ = O. The potential V(¢) = _ m21¢12 + ~1¢1 4 is minimized when 1¢1 2 == ~. 

28.2 Spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries 
,-----------------------------------------------------------
So nOW there are an infinite number of equivalent vacua IDe) with (De 1¢IDe) = V 
2r;:2 eie 
fof any constant e. 
All the vacua are equivalent (by symmetry) so we can pick any convenient parametriza-
tion. It is conventional to pick ID) so that (D I¢I D) is real. Then (D I¢I D) = v = V
2r;:2. 
Instead of writing ¢( x) = v + ¢( x), with ¢( x) a complex field, it is often more convenient 
to expand around v by parametrizing ¢(x) in terms of two real fields o-(x) and 1f(x) as 
(28.11) 
with FJr a real number. Then V (¢) depends only on 0-, and not on 1f. Expanding the 
Lagrangian around the minimum we find 
(28.12) 
Choosing F1C = ~ = V2v then makes the 1f kinetic term canonically normalized. This 
theory is called a linear sigma model. The 1f field is massless and is the Goldstone boson. 
11' is often called a pion because, as we will see, it is closely related to the real-world 
hadrons 1f± and 1fo. 
The Lagrangian in Eq. (28.12) describes a massless particle 1f, as well as a massive 
particle 0-. Massless Goldstone bosons such as 1f will appear in any theory with spontaneous 
symmetry breaking (by Goldstone's theorem), with one massless particle for each broken 
symmetry. Note that having a massless particle has nothing to do with how we parametrize 
¢; if we wrote ¢(x) = ~ + ¢(x) there would be a mass matrix for the two complex 
components of ¢ which has a zero eigenvalue. Diagonalizing this matrix would lead back 
to our sigma model (see Problem 28.1). In the linear sigma model, the 0- field has mass 
mQ' = V2m. The 0- field can be visualized as radial excitations of the potential shown in 
Figure 28.1, which is commonly called a Mexican hat potential. 
Goldstone bosons are naturally associated with shift symmetries. Recall that the broken 
symmetry was ¢( x) --> eie ¢( x). The vacuum (¢) = V 
2r;:2 certainly breaks the symmetry. 
However, the symmetry is still realized as 
(28.13) 
with 0- invariant. This is a symmetry of the sigma-model Lagrangian, Eq. (28.12). That a 
phase rotation of ¢ amounts to a shift in 1f can be seen transparently in Eq. (28.11). The 
symmetry can be used to strongly constrain the sigma model, even if the full theory that 
is spontaneously broken is not known. In particular, the shift symmetry forbids a mass 
term for 1f(x). In fact, there is a close connection between Goldstone's theorem, which 
requires a massless mode, and shift symmetries of the Goldstone bosons, corresponding to 
lllovement around the flat direction of the potential, as in Figure 28.1.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking 
Mexican hat potential. The masses squared of particles are given by the second 
derivatives of the potential. Expanding around the origin, there are two tachyonic (negative 
mass-squared) modes (long-dashed line). Expanding around a minimum, there is one 
mode with positive mass-squared (small-dashed line), corresponding to excitations along 
the radial direction, and one massless mode (solid line), corresponding to excitations along 
the symmetry direction where the potential is flat. 
To distinguish the Goldstone bosons, whose interactions are determined by symmetry, 
from the radial modes, such as (J, which are model dependent and invariant under the 
symmetry, we can take the limit m -7 00 and A -7 00 keeping F7r = ~ fixed. Then the 
Lagrangian reduces to 
(28.14) 
which is a theory of a free pion. This decoupling limit is much more interesting in theories 
where the pions do not become fi"ee particles, like the ones we are about to discuss. The 
Lagrangian (28.14) is an example of a nonlinear sigma model, which is the linear sigma 
model in which the (J field has been decoupled. 
To see that 1r is the Goldstone boson in Eq. (28.8), we calculate the Noether current in 
the decoupling limit from Eq. (28.14) using the symmetry transformation in Eq. (28.13). 
We find 
f.L _ 8£ b7r _ 
J -
of.L7r b8 - F7r of.L7r. 
(28.15) 
Thus, defining 17r) as the state created and annihilated by the 7r field, we have 
(28.16) 
Comparing to Eq. (28.9) we see 17r) is the Goldstone boson. 
28.2.2 SU(2) X SU(2) 
Now let us study a more interesting case. The QCD Lagrangian including only the up and 
down quarks is

left-handed quarks and the right-handed quarks are completely decoupled. Indeed, writing 
the right- and left-handed spinors as 1/J:/ L = ~ (1 ± ')'5) 1/Jq, the Lagrangian is 
£: = - ~ (F:v) 2 + iuL I/JuL + iflR I/JuR + idL I/JdL + idR I/JdR. 
(28.18) 
This is invariant under separate rotations: 
(28.19) 
where gL E SU(2)L and gR E SU(2)R' Equivalently, the symmetry can be written as 
q ---> ei (e"T
a
+r5f3aTa)q where q = 
(~) is a flavor doublet of the Dirac spinors u and 
d. The set of transformations parametrized by ()a with (Ja = 0 is the diagonal subgroup, 
called isospin. The set of transformations parametrized by (Ja with ()a = 0 are the axial 
rotations. 
The SU(2)L x SU(2)R symmetry ofQCD is called a chiral symmetry, since it acts dif-
ferently on left- and right-handed fields. Actually. the Lagrangian in Eq. (28.18) is invariant 
under U(2) x U(2) = SU(2h x SU(2)R x U(I)v X U(I)A, with the two U(I) symmetries 
called vector and axial. The Noether ClllTents associated with these symmetries are (up to 
a sign) 
J~ = qTa,),i"q, 
J~a = qTa~/i",5q, J:: = ihi"q, J: = fi,),i",),5 q. 
(28.20) 
We will see in Chapter 34 that the axial U(I), under which q ..... ei1hs q, is not an exact sym-
mell'y of QCD with massless quarks since it is broken by quantum effects called anomalies. 
The vector U(I) symmetry, under which q ..... eieq, is a symmetry even when quark masses 
are included, as in Eq. (28.17). It corresponds to baryon number conservation (or quark 
number conservation: quarks contribute ~ to baryon number and antiquarks -
~). In the 
full Standard Model, including weak interactions, baryon number is also anomalous. How-
ever, the difference between baryon number and lepton number, B - L, is non-anomalous. 
Because of these anomalies, we will postpone the discussion of the U (1) symmetries until 
Chapter 34 and concentrate on the spontaneous breaking of SU(2) x SU(2). 
Spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2) x SU(2) happened 14 billion years ago, 
When the temperature of the universe cooled below Tc ~ AQCD . Below that scale, the 
thermal energy of quarks dropped below their binding energy and, instead of a big quark-
gluon plasma, hadrons appeared. Although it has not been proven from QCD itself, the 
ground state of QeD apparently has a non-zero expectation value for the quark bilinears 
flu and dd: 
(28.21) 
We will confirm this by checking that it implies a spectrum of hadrons consistent with 
nature. One may have imagined that (uu) and (dd) could have had different expectation

the proton. Indeed, the neutron IS a udd bound state and the proton a uud bound state. Thus 
the neutron and proton differ by d ~ u, which is why W = (~) form an isospin dOUblet 
like (~). The electric charge of course distinguishes the neutron from the proton, but this 
is a small effect, and negligible from the point of much of nuclear physics. If we ignore 
electric charge and quark masses, the proton and neutron are related by an exact unbroken 
isospin symmetry. 
At this point, we will forget all about QeD and just use the symmetry-breaking pattern 
SU(2) x SU(2) -) SU(2)isospin to write down an effective description in terms of composite 
fields. The low-energy theory that we construct will be one of pions. While the pions are, in 
reality, composite states of quarks and gluons, they are also Goldstone bosons. As we will 
see, the symmetry-breaking pattern alone will to tell us a tremendous amount about how 
pions must interact with each other. Their interactions are independent of whether they are 
composed of QeD fields or of little green aliens. 
As with the linear sigma model discussed in Section 28.2.1 above, we will model spon-
taneous symmetry breaking with a set of scalar fields I:ij (x) transforming linearly under 
SU(2) x SU(2): 
I: -) gLI:gl, 
I:t -) gRI:Tgl-
An effective Lagrangian for this field is the linear sigma model: 
£ = IOjLI:12 + m2 1I:12 - ~ 1I:14 , 
(28.22) 
(28.23) 
where 1I:12 = I:ijI:}i' This is invariant under SU(2) x SU(2) through Eq. (28.22). Note 
that only ordinary (not covariant) derivatives are required since we are interested in the 
global (not local) symmetries. Also, the potential has been chosen so that spontaneous 
symmetry breaking occurs. The potential is minimized for (I:ij ) = ~ G ~), where 
v = ~, which breaks the SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry down to the diagonal SU(2). One 
expects v rv V rv AQCD , but there can be constant factors between these quantities. To be 
clear, v = ~ depends on parameters in the sigma model, V = (UU)1/3 is the expectation 
value of a quark operator in the QeD vacuum, and AQCD is the location of the Landau 
pole in the running as . 
As in Section 28.2.1 we then write I: in terms of a modulus field a(x) and angular 
fields 7r(x):

with FJr = ~ = v chosen so that Ira (x) have canonically normalized kinetic terms, as you 
can check by expanding Eq. (28.23). If we write 9L = exp(i()'IJa ) and 9R = exp(i()'RTa )

where jabc = cabc are the structure constants for the unbroken subgroup SU(2)isospin. We 
see that for the unbroken transformations (isospin, ()'L = ()'R) the Ira fields transform in the 
adjoint representation. This is consistent with nature, where the physical pion fields, Ir°, Ir+ 
and Ir-, transform in the adjoint representation of isospin. Under the axial transformations, 
with ()'L = -()'R, the Ira fields transform nonlinearly - they shift at leading order. Higher-
order terms in the transformation can be determined straightforwardly (see Problem 28.2). 
This shift symmetry in Eq. (28.25) forbids a mass term for Ira. Indeed, since the field (5 
does not transform under any of the symmetries, it is irrelevant to anything we can predict 
using symmetries. So we will decouple (5 by taking m ---'> 00 and A ---'> 00, holding PIT 
fixed. Then we have

SU(2) as U ---'> 9L U 91. All we need to see the consequences of symmetry breaking is the 
nonlinear sigma model constructed only out of U. 
With nothing but symmetry to guide us, we should write down the most general

This is the Chiral Lagrangian. The covariant derivatives here contain only electroweak 
gauge fields, not gluons. The electroweak gauge boson kinetic terms are in L but not written 
for simplicity. Note that, since ut = U- 1 , terms such as uut are trivial. Thus, every term 
in the Chiral Lagrangian must have a derivative in it. In particular, a mass term for the 
pions is forbidden, which is consistent with the pions being massless Goldstone bosons.

-ttr [(DItU) (D ItU) t]. In other words, pion interactions have a very special form. Befo 
the advent of effective Lagrangians, like the Chiral Lagrangian, people understood t~e 
constraints among the interactions of pions using symmetries and on-shell states direct] e 
through a technique called current algebra. Since effective actions provide a more ef~~ 
cient way to encode the symmetries of a theory, current algebra is now mostly of historical 
interest. 
Note that the interactions coming from the leading term in the Chiral Lagrangian all 
have two derivatives, while the interactions from the subleading Li terms have four Or 
more derivatives. Thus, at low energy, these terms will give contributions suppressed b 
powers of J!". compared to the predictions of the leading term. Thus, even though the Chr-
ral Lagrangian is a non-renormalizable theory, it still makes predictions. In fact, it makes 
predictions at loop level as well through calculable non-analytic momentum dependence 
(sometimes called chirallogarithms). Once the leading term is renormalized, finite ana-
lytic predictions from the Chiral Lagrangian can also be made. Indeed, there is a whole 
industry of people computing various low-energy observables using the Chiral Lagrangian 
and its generalizations. 
By a lucky coincidence, the chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken by QCD is 
connected to weak interactions in the Standard Model. The weak interactions are the sub-
ject of Chapter 29, and here we only summarize some relevant results. In the Standard 
Model, SU(2h is gauged, with associated gauge bosons HT:. The interactions of the W 
bosons have the form 
.cweak = ~ W:(J: - J!a) = ~ W: [VijQn'"(1 - (5 ) TaQj + LnltTa(l - (5) Li] , 
(28.29) 
where Qi, with i = 1, 2,3, are SU(2) doublets of quarks and the L i , also with i = 1,2,3, 
are SU(2) doublets with leptons. For example, Ql = (u, d) and L1 = (e, ve ) . Vij is the 
CKM matrix which we set to 6ij for simplicity. Now, according to Goldstone's theorem, 
the pions are created from the vacuum by the chiral SU(2) cunent J~a, as in Eq. (28.16): 
(28.30) 
This would be h'ue even if SU(2) L were not gauged. This equation allows pions to turn 
into axial cunents. The matrix dement in Eq. (28.30) indicates that J~a = Frr8p 1fo. 
Indeed, this is nothing but the Noether current for i o. pin in the Chiral Lagrangian using 
the transformation properties in Eq. (28.25). 
The connection between the pions and the axial current in Eq. (28.30) let

and 'l/Ju, 'l/Jd, 'l/J" and 'i/Jv". refer to the up quark, down quark, muon, and muon neutrino 
fields, respectively, and the· .. represent the other fermion species. L4F comprises a set 
of 4-Fermi interactions involving four quarks, four leptons or two quarks and two leptons. 
GF can be measured from the leptonic interactions, such as the decay rate p,- --+ e-vev", 
which gives GF = 1.16 x 10-5 GeV- 2 (see Chapters 29 and 31). Then, Eq. (28.30) 
allows the pion to tum into an axial cUlTent, which turns into a leptonic current. The matrix 
element for n+ --+ p,+ Ve is then 
(28.33) 
Squaring this matrix element and integrating over the leptonic phase space, we find the rate 
for n+ --+ p,+ v" is 
(28.34) 
Using the measured pion lifetime T = r- 1 = 2.6 x 10-8 s, m,n: = 139.5MeV and 
m" = 106 MeV, we find the pion decay constant is F" = 92 MeV. l With F7r fit to data, 
there are no longer any free parameters in the leading-order Chiral Lagrangian, Eq. (28.28). 
We can therefore proceed to make predictions for amplitudes, such as (Y (nOna --+ n+ n- ), 
using the interactions in Eq. (28.28) that can be compared to data. 
One can also relate the pion mass to quark masses, using either CUlTent algebra or effec-
tive Lagrangians. Quark masses explicitly break chiral symmetry, which in tum implies 
that pions are not massless Goldstone bosons, but massive pseudo-Goldstone bosons. To 
see how the pions are affected by the quark masses, we write the quark-mass term as 
Ai = (mu 0) . 
o 
md 
(28.35) 
This term breaks chiral symmetry. However, we will now employ a trick to restore chiral 
symmetry. Let us pretend for a moment that the masses are not constants but fields (which 
happen to be constant). Then we can assign transformation properties to M. If we decide 
that under SU(2) x SU(2) the mass matrix transforms as !'vI --+ gL!'vI g1, then the mass term 
would be invariant. Constants treated as fields in this way are sometimes called spurions, 
since they are spurious (fictional) fields. Now, the low-energy theory of pions does not 
have quarks in it, but it can depend on the mass matrix. Therefore we can use spurious 
transformation properties to constrain the way the mass matrix can appear in the Chiral 
I Another common definition for Fir you may find in the literature is (S1IJ~(x)I71"- (p)) = if"plle-ipx 
instead of Eg. (28.30). Since 71"- = ~ 
(71"1 - i71"2). this leads to fTC = V2F" = 130 !\Ie V. To avoid a 
proliferation of factors of V2 we stick with F7r = 92 GeV Occasionally, J7r = 92 GeV is used [Peskin and 
SChroeder, 1995], but this convention is uncommon.

The prefactor ~3 is fixed so that the vacuum ~nergy contributed by .LNI matches the Vac_ 
uum energy in .Lm . Indeed, when (uu) = (dd) = V 3, we find .Lm = V3(mu + nod) 
which matches the expansion in Eq. (28.36). We can now read off the pion masses: 
'

m; = F2 (mu + md) .

This is known as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation. It says that the square of 
the pion mass scales linearly with the quark masses. For example, with V rv AQCD ,...., 
250 MeV, F.". = 130 MeV, and m.". = 140 MeV, this relation gives mu + md '" 11 Mev. 
The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation has been confirmed with lattice QCD (see Figure 
25.3). Keep in mind that these quark masses correspond to whatever renormalized masses 
appear in Eq. (28.35), which are not necessarily pole masses or MS masses. 
Thus, using only the pattern of symmetry breaking, we were able to extract the pion 
decay constant F."., relate pion masses to quark masses, and calculate quantum effects SUch 
as pion scattering. The symmetries also constrain the pion interactions with baryons, such 
as the proton and neutron. Indeed, it was the modeling of the strong interactions among 
protons and neutrons through Yukawa forces mediated by pion exchange that elucidated 
the symmetry principles we have so concisely encoded in the Chiral Lagrangian. 
By the way, note that if we contract Eq. (28.30) with Pi-' we find, if the current J~a is con-
served, that p2 F; = m;F; = O. This connects the chiral symmetry, with its corresponding 
conserved current, to masslessness of the Goldstone bosons. If the current is not exactly 
conserved, as in the real world because of quark masses, then 8i-'J~ = mqq"'lTaq #- 0, in 
which case the pion picks up a mass proportional to m q . 
28.2.3 SU(3) X SU(3) 
It is only a coincidence (as far as we know) that S' (2)weak and SU(2),l, relate the lime 
two quarks. To the extent that three quarks can be lreated as light, the di cu ion in ec· 
tion 28.2.2 can be extended to SU(3h x SU(3)n in a . lraightfolward way. The third 
lightest quark is the strange quark, whose mass, m

The relatively large strange quark masses can be added as a perturbation to this picture, as 
the up and down quark ma e ' were, and the re ulting effeclive theory seems to work very 
well phenomenologically. 
When SU(3h x SU(3)R -t SU(3)v through (uu) = (dd) = (88) = V3, the 16 
symmetries are reduced to 8, leaving 16 - 8 = 8 pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These are

Chiral symmetry relates many properties of these mesons. For details see [Georgi, 1984; 
Donoghue el aI., 1992]. 
Besides mesons, chiral symmetry breaking also describes baryons, which are bound 
states of three quarks. Three colored quarks can be combined into a color singlet with 
the totally antisymmetric tensor as B = Eijkqi qj qk. We need a little-group theory to see 
hoW they transform under the unbroken SU(3). The product of three triplets gives (see e.g. 
[Georgi, J 982]) 
3 Q9 3 Q9 3 = (6 EB 3) Q9 3 = (6 Q9 3) ffi (3 Q9 3) = 10 EB 8 ffi 8 ffi 1. 
(28.39) 
So there is a decuplet (the 10), two octets (called just 8 since the 8 is the adjoint 
representation which is real) and a singlet. The proton and neutron sit in one octet: 
(28.40) 
The meson and baryon octets in Eqs. (28.38) and (28.40) were given the enlightened 
moniker of the eightfold way by Murray Gell-Mann. 
Another way to represent the octet or the decuplet is by their quantum numbers. Such 
diagrams are shown in Figure 28.2. Gell-Mann worked out these representations in 1962, 
when everything but the D- had been seen. He was therefore able to predict that the D-
should exist, and, using symmetry, its mass and quantum numbers. The D- was discov-
ered in 1964 with exactly the properties Gell-Mann predicted. The D- was historically 
important as a true theoretical prediction and helped people believe in quarks. 
28.2.4 Discussion 
In summary, we have seen that spontaneous symmetry breaking of chiral SU(2) x SU(2) 
leads to a triplet of pions (or the meson octet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons for the three-
flavor case). The pions can be studied through a nonlinear sigma model with a field 
U(x) = exp(2i7raT a / F7f)' The Lagrangian written in terms of U(x) must be invariant 
under the full SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry. This strongly constrains the terms that can 
be written down. In fact, the transformation properties U(x) --> gLUg1, under which 
the pions themselves transform nonlinearly, determine almost everything about pion 
COUplings. This approach to determining pion couplings was pioneered by Callan, Cole-
man, Wess and Zurnino (CCWZ) in 1969 [Callan et al., 1969; Coleman et at., 1969].

Baryon octet and decuplet organized by quantum numbers. Diagonal lines have the same 
charge and horizontal lines have the same strangeness (number of strange quarks minus 
strange antiquarks in the hadron). 
The effective theory is extremely predictive even at the quantum level, despite being non-
renormalizable. Predictions were discussed in Chapter 22 on non-renormalizable theories. 
We have actually used the CCWZ trick a couple of times already: one was in building up 
the Lagrangians for massless spin-l and spin-2 particles, in Section 8.7, and the other was 
in the Faddeev-Popov procedure, in Sections 14.5 and 25.4. 
More generally, consider a continuous global symmetry G spontaneously broken down 
to a subgroup H. The vacuum is then invariant under H, but not under the remaining 
elements of G, which are denoted as a coset and written as G / H. The coset is not a 
subgroup of G (for example, it does not contain the identity element). We have seen that 
the Goldstone bosons transform in a linear representation of the unbroken subgroup H 
(e.g. the pions are a triplet of isospin) but nonlinearly under G / H . 
An important point is that the nonlinear transformations, under which the Goldstone 
bosons shift, are transformations of fields, such as 7fa(x), but not of states appearing as 
excitations around the same vacuum in a Hilbert space. In that sense, nonlinear transfor-
mations are like gauge transformations, which are a concept derived from the Lagrangian 
description. In contrast, linearly realized global symmetries, as for the unbroken group H, 
act on states. These are symmetries with associated conserved charges which can be mea-
sured. There is no conserved charged for a broken symmetry, despite the fact that it can be 
restored in a Lagrangian with a nonlinear transformation. Since the vacuum is not invari-
ant, the broken symmetry relates different ground states, and relates excitations around one 
ground state to excitations around another. 
Finally, consider the case when the phase trallsition under which a . ymmetry group 0 
is broken is smooth (i.e. second order). Above ('he 'ymmetry-breaking scale there should 
be states transforming linearly under the full group. Thu. , at the tran ition cale incc

bosons or with a linear multiplet. Thus, it mu. t be p s. ible t embed lhe Gold lone boson

28.3 The Higgs mechanism 
---------------------------------------------------------------
a precise definition of the order parameter. A more detailed discussion of this point is given 
jll [Weinberg, 1996, Section 19.6]. 
28.3 The Higgs mechanism 
We have seen that a spontaneously broken continuous global symmetry generates Gold-
stone bosons transforming as elements of the coset G / H, where G is the original symmetry 
grOUP and H is the symmetry group of the vacuum. Now we consider what happens if there 
js a gauge boson associated with the broken symmetry. As we will see, this causes the 
Goldstone boson to disappear from the spectrum and the gauge boson to become massive 
through a procedure known as the Higgs mechanism. 
The Higgs mechanism is not quite fairly named, since the same idea was discovered 
and understood by many people in different contexts, including Anderson (who proposed 
it first in a non-relativistic context in 1962), as well as Brout, Englert, Ginzburg, Guralnik, 
Hagan, Kibble, Landau and, of course, Higgs. 
We will first discuss one physical example, type-II superconductors, which can be under-
stood through an Abelian Higgs model. Then we will discuss non-Abelian theories, leading 
up to the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model of electroweak symmetry, which is the subject 
of the next chapter. 
28.3.1 Abelian Higgs model

which is known as the Abelian Higgs model. As before, the wrong-sign mass term for the 
scalar indicates that the ground state has I (c/J) I = :h. = V

them, we write, as in Eq. (28.11),

Spontaneous symmetry breaking 
---
This suggests that the gauge boson has picked up a mass: 
(28.45) 
Similarly, the a field has mass ma = v2m and 1T is massless. Unfortunately, because ther 
are bilinear terms mixing 1T, a and A{L' extracting the spectrum is not quite that simple. e 
We can simplify things by decoupling a through the limit m, A --) CXl with v fixed W, 
used this decoupling limit in Section 28.2.1. Taking this limit projects out the nonli'nea~ 
sigma model, which is constrained by symmetries, from the linear sigma model, which ha~ 
additional modes such as a, about which we cannot say much. In the decoupling limit, the 
Lagrangian in Eq. (28.43) simplifies to 
(28.46) 
This implies that we should set F7r = v so that 1T(X) has canonical normalization. This 
Lagrangian has a gauge boson mass term, a kinetic term for 1T, as well as an A{LfJ{L1T cross 
term indicating kinetic mixing between 1T and AI-" The kinetic mixing makes interpreting 
the physical spectrum tricky; however, it can be removed through gauge-fixing, as we will 
now see. 
The gauge symmetry in the Lagrangian in Eq. (28.46) is 
(28.47) 
Note that the 1T transformation is not the transformation law for a scalar field in a linear rep-
resentation, but it is a gauge transformation nonetheless. Now we can remove the kinetic 
mixing by choosing a gauge. One gauge, called unitary gauge, just uses the shift to set 
1T(X) = O. In this gauge the Lagrangian becomes simply that of a massive gauge boson. 
Another convenient gauge is Lorenz gauge, fJ{LA{L = O. In this gauge the cross term van-
ishes (after integration by parts), and the field 1T is massless with a normal kinetic term with 
the correct sign. In this gauge, the constrained gauge field has two degrees of freedom and 
the pion has one degree of freedom, which are the same three degrees of freedom of the 
unconstrained massive gauge boson in unitary gauge. Thus, we say that, in unitary gauge, 
the gauge boson eats the Goldstone boson through the Higgs mechanism. 
In the case of broken local symmetrie (in c ntrast to global ymmetries), th Low-energy 
theory has no memory lhat the ymmetry wa spontaneously br ken in tead of explicitly 
broken. Indeed, the Lagrangian in Eq. (28.44), with explicit symmetry breaking, cun be 
turned into the nonlinear sigma model in Eq. (28.46) by inLegraling in a pion. thaI is, 
by performing a field redefinition A{L --) A/, + e~ .. O,,1T (we performed this exerci.e in 
Section 8.7). This introduces a gauge invariancc Eq. (2 .47). Using thi. gauge invariance 
to set 1T = 0 reverts to the theory with the ma ive gauge boo on. In fact, introducing pion. in 
this way turns out to be an efficient way to snldy the high-energy PI' pertie of a theory with 
a massive gauge boson, since scalars are easier to com pule with than longitudinal modes or 
gauge bosons. That the pions and the longitudinal mode: are equivalent i a re Lilt kno\ II 
as the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem, to be discussed more in Section 29.2. 

28.3 The Higgs mechanism 
,---------------------------------------------------------
Although in the low-energy theory massive gauge bosons will not reveal if the origin of 
their masses is from spontaneous symmetry breaking or not, spontaneously broken theo-
ries are renormalizable while explicitly broken ones are not. How is this possible if they are 
indistinguishable? The difference is the (J field, also known as the Higgs boson, present 
in the spontaneously broken theory in Eq. (28.43), but not in the explicitly broken one, 
Bq. (28.44). The Higgs boson plays a crucial role in the renormalizability of spontaneously 
broken gauge theories. This is easy to see from simply looking at the Lagrangian: the lin-
ear sigma model, including the full ¢, has no terms with mass dimension greater than 4. In 
contrast, a nonlinear sigma model, with just the ?T fields, is generally non-renormalizable, 
as in Eq. (28.28). The Abelian Higgs model is a special case that happens to be renormaliz-
able without the (J field because a photon has no self-interactions, or equivalently, because 
the?T field has no interactions in the nonlinear sigma model. 
28.3.2 Superconductors 
The Abelian Higgs model is realized in nature in superconductors. The Ginzburg-Landau 
model of superconductivity simply postulates that the Lagrangian in Eq. (28.41) describes 
superconductors near the critical temperature Tc with ¢ the order parameter. So the 
effective Lagrangian is 
(28.48) 
with m 2 '" T - T c and D" the covariant derivative of QED. Below the critical temperature, 
the mass-squared for ¢ becomes negative and the U(l)QED is spontaneously broken. Thus, 
the photon picks up a mass, mAo The effective low-energy Lagrangian in unitary gauge 
in the decoupling limit is 
(28.49) 
One immediate consequence of this effective description is that the photon mass term 
makes it energetically unfavorable to have magnetic fields. Indeed, a constant magnetic 
field would come from a linearly growing A", giving an enormous contribution to the 
energy. Thus, magnetic fields must not be able to exist inside superconductors. The screen-
ing of magnetic fields inside superconductors is known as the Meissner effect. Another 
way to connect the Meissner effect to a photon mass is to recall that a massive photon gen-
erates a Yukawa potential with length scale R = ~A' known as the penetration depth. 
This is the characteristic scale with which magnetic fields can persist in a superconductor. 
What happens if we crank up the magnetic field B? At some point, the field energy 
Would be larger than the energy saved by having (¢) cJ 0, so we would lose supercon-
ductivity. Of course (¢) does not have to be 0 everywhere or v everywhere; it can have 
finite-size domains where superconductivity is lost. These domains will have a character-
istic size ~ = ~, known as the correlation length. The two length scales are set by the 
two parameters in the Ginzburg-Landau model: mA and m, with mA = ev = e ~. In the 
case that ~ < R, so-called type-II superconductors, the system is unstable to formation 
of flux tubes of cross-sectional area ?Te within the superconductor. These are known as 
577 
-: ' .. 

578 
spontaneous symmetry breaking 
Abrikosov vortices. For R > ~, the type-I superconductors, the vortex size is larger th 
the penetration depth, and so vortices will not spontaneously form. 
an 
To connect this model to superconductivity, we note that the flux in the vortices is qUaI _ 
tized in units of E1re, so the vortices cannot dissipate smoothly to zero. At the microsco : 
level, these vortices have to be formed by electrons swirling around within the materfa\C 
If there were any resistance to this motion, the electrons would slow down and the fi . 
would cbange. Thus, this system must be superconducting. Thus, the Ginzburg-Land~l( 
model gives a direct connection between the Meissner effect and superconductivity (se
U 
e.g. [Weinberg, 1995] or [Altland and Simons, 2010] for a less hand-waving eXPlanation)~ 
The Ginzburg-Landau effective field theory description corresponds to a beautiful 
microscopic picture due to Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer. There, the phase transition 
is understood as due to attractive interactions between electrons through phonon ex chang e. 
So ¢ is identified with pairs of electrons, ¢ rv e-e_, which are known as Cooper pairs Or 
BCS pairs. When (¢) i- 0, the ground state has a non-zero charge, which explains why 
the symmetry of QED is broken. 
28.3.3 Non-Abelian gauge theories 
Next, consider the spontaneous breaking of a gauged non-Abelian symmetry. The proce-
dure is almost identical to the Abelian case, but now there will be one massive gauge boson 
for each broken-symmetry generator. So the number of massive and massless bosons in 
the low-energy theory will depend on the representation of the group in which the order 
parameter transforms. 
For example, consider an 80(3) gauge theory. We introduce three real scalars ¢i and 
the Lagrangian 
(28.50) 
These scalars transform in the fundamental representation of 80(3). The potential is mini-
mized for I(¢')I = v = J 6rr/. By an 80(3) transformation, we can pick the direction and 
phase so that (¢3) = v and (¢1) = (¢2) = O. That is, without loss of generality, we take 
(28.51 ) 
This vacuum is invariant under H = 80(2) c G = 80(3), which rotates ¢1 and (/J2. 
Since 80(2) has one generator and 80(3) has three, there will be two Goldstone bosons 
that are eaten to form two massive gauge bosons. To see this explicitly, we can expand the 
Lagrangian in unitary gauge (that is, the nonlinear sigma model with 1r = 0). We find 
(28.52)

with m~ = g2v2, which describes two massive gauge bosons and one massless one, as 
expected. 
As a second example, consider an SU(5) gauge theory where the order parameter is 
a set of scalar fields <D a . This is called the Georgi-Glashow model. For SU (5) there are 
52 - 1 = 24 generators, which we call T~j in the adjoint representation. These are 24 trace-
less Hermitian matrices. One can write down a potential for <I> = <DaTa (see Problem 28.5) 
so that its expectation value is 
2 
2 -3 ). 
-3 
(28.55) 
The number of massless gauge bosons in the broken phase is determined by the subgroup 
ofSU(5) that is unbroken by this vacuum expectation value. Clearly, there will be an SU(3) 
subgroup, rotating the top-left 3 x 3 block, and an SU(2) subgroup, rotating the bottom-
right 2 x 2 block, which are unbroken and commute with each other. More generally, 
the mass term for A~ is given by tr([v, Tal [v, T a ]), so the unbroken subgroup is gener-
ated by the generators of SU(5) that commute with v. In addition to the block-diagonal 
SD(3) and SU(2) generators, there is also the generator proportional to v itself, which 
obviously commutes with v. This generates a U(l) subgroup. So this vacuum expectation 
value breaks SU(5) ---> SU(3) x SU(2) x U(l). That is, it breaks SU(5) to the Standard 
Model gauge group. This suggests that the Standard Model gauge group might actually 
be just the unbroken subgroup of a larger SU(5). There are two amazing things about this 
type of grand unification: the gauge coupling constants are related and must unify (which 
they appear to do, more-or-Iess), and the quantum numbers of the quarks and leptons are 
explained from SU (5) representations. 
A third example is the spontaneous breaking of SU(2) x U(l) 
---> U(l), corre-
SPonding to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry down to the U(l) symmetry of 
electromagnetism. We will study this example in detail in Chapter 29.

28.4 Quantization of spontaneously broken 
gauge theories 
To derive the Feynman rules for a spontaneously broken gauge theory, we have to W ork: 
out the propagators for the Goldstone bosons as well as the massive gauge bosons. First 
of all, as we already observed, a broken gauge theory at low energy is the same Whethe 
it is explicitly or spontaneously broken; the difference is in the extra fields, such as a . r 
the linear sigma model, which are in general heavy. While fields such as (J are releva~~ 
to the UV completion of the theory with massive vector bosons, they are also mOdel_ 
dependent (that is, how many there are and their quantum numbers depend on the details of 
spontaneous symmetry breaking, in contrast to the Goldstone bosons and massive vector 
bosons). Since the Goldstone bosons can be completely removed in unitary gauge, We can 
choose this gauge, and then the only field left is the massive vector boson we discllssed 
in Chapter 8. In unitary gauge, taking all the gauge boson masses equal for simpliCity, the 
Lagrangian is

This is the unitary-gauge propagator for the vector field. In many circumstances, it is 
preferable to be able to use other gauges, in which case the Goldstone bosons will also 
be propagating degrees of freedom. 
The easiest way to derive the Lagrangian for the Goldstone bosons and the vector 
fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking, that is, the gauged nonlinear sigma model, 
is the CCWZ method discussed in Section 28.2.4. Starting with the Lagrangian for the 
massive vector bosons, the Goldstone bosons are introduced to restore the broken sym-
metry. That is, we replace A~Ta --+ U A~TaU - I -

The new term removes the kinetic mixing and lets us invert the kinetic terms to find 
propagators. For the Abelian case, this completes the gauge-fixing. In the non-Abelian 
case, we have to gauge-fix carefully using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. We take as our 
gauge-fixing functional

The numerator in the vector boson propagator sums over the three physical polarizatio ns 
Thus there is no need for anything else. This is called unitary gauge because only phYsica' 
modes propagate. Thus, if you cut through a diagram, you will find only states that can I 
on-shell; thus unitarity will be satisfied trivially in the sense of the optical theorem.

In this gauge, all the propagators have the same mass and simple numerators. You can 
think of the gILl/ in the vector boson propagator as summing over all four polarizations with 
the ghosts removing the longitudinal and timelike polarizations (as in the massless case), 
but now the Goldstone bosons put the longitudinal polarizations back into the physical 
spectrum. 
Note that in any gauge with finite ( all the propagators scale as ;2 at large p, so the theory 
will be renormalizable in the power-counting sense. And, of course, it can be renormalized. 
But it is still non-renormalizable in the sense that an infinite number of counterterms are 
needed. No problems are solved by these fancy gauges - the theory will still be strongly 
coupled at the scale Fir = ~A, as we discussed in Section 22.2 and will elaborate upon in 
Chapter 29. 
The amazing thing about spontaneously broken gauge theories is that when they come 
from linear sigma models they are in fact renormalizable - you only need a finite number of 
counterterms. For renormalizability, the extra scalar field (J" in the linear sigma model plays 
a crucial role. In the Standard Model, this (J" is the Higgs boson. Since (J" is not charged 
under the broken or unbroken symmetry, its kinetic terms have nothing to do with 7r or AI'" 
Indeed, its Lagrangian is just that of Eq. (28.12):

At high energy this propagator scales as -\. (J" comes into the theory in exactly the right way

to cancel the extra divergences of the massive vector theory. This is not at all obvious 111 
any of the R~ gauges, but it is obvious physically: at high energy, E » m 2 , the masS can 
be neglected and spontaneous symmetry breaking becomes a small effect. Thus, at high 
energy, the linear sigma model is just a gauge theory coupled to a linearly transforming 
matter field, and is renormalizable for the same reason that non-Abelian gauge theories are 
renormalizable.

Now that we have studied spontaneously broken gauge theories, we are finally ready to 
understand the weak interactions. From a practical point of view, we understood almost 
everything we needed about this theory back when we introduced the Lagrangian for a 
massive vector boson. The weak interactions are mediated by massive vector bosons whose 
kinetic terms are described by the Proca Lagrangian we derived in Section 8.2.2. The low_ 
energy limit of the massive vector theory, the 4-Fermi theory, completely characterizes the 
most familiar effect of the weak force: radioactive decay. At high energy, there is no weak 
force, per se, only an electroweak force which is spontaneously broken down to the electric 
and weak forces at low energy. There are many aspects of electroweak physics that only 
become apparent at high energy, such as the existence of Wand Z bosons. 
Once we introduce the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model for electro weak unification, 
we will be able to explore this quantum field theory both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
We begin by describing the gauge sector and the symmetry-breaking pattern SU(2) X 
U(1) ----+ U(l). We will then see how the nonlinear sigma model with just the Wand 
Z bosons violates unitarity bounds at tree-level, indicating that the theory is sick (non-
perturbative above rv 1 Te V). We then show how the physical Higgs boson comes to the 
rescue and makes the theory perturbative again. The remainder of this chapter discusses 
the fermion sector, mass generation and mixing angles, the absence of tree-level flavor-
changing neutral CUlTents in the Standard Model, and CF violation.

Electroweak unification is based on the symmetry breaking of SU(2) x U(l)y -> U(l)EM' 
The high-energy U(l) symmetry is called hypercharge, denoted U(l)y; it is not to be 
confused with the low-energy U(l) associated with electromagnetism, denoted U(l)EM. 
As we will see, the massless particle we know as the photon is a linear combination of the 
hypercharge gauge bo on and one fthe generators of SU(2). 
Tn the Standard Model, S (2) x U(l )y is broken by the vacuum expectation value (vev) 
of a complex doublet H with hypercbnrge ~ called the Higgs multiplet. The Lagrangian is

Bere, g and g' are the SU(2) and U(l )y couplings, respectively. The factor of ~ in the 
BiJH coupling comes from the Higgs multiplet having hypercharge Y = ~ . 
The Higgs potential V(H ) = _ m 2 [H[ 2 + A[H[4 in Eq. (29.1) induces a vev for H , 
which we can take to be real and in the lower component without loss of generality. Thus 
we can expand 
(29.3) 
with v = 7>:.- and T a = ~(Ja the canonically normalized SU(2) generators. The factors of 
}z in this equation convert between the canonical normalization of a complex scalar (H) 
and a real scalar (h). Other conventions are sometimes used. As discussed in Chapter 28, 
it is simplest to study this theory in unitary gauge, so we set 1f = O. We also postpone the 
discussion of terms with h in them. Plugging in the vev, we get 
(29.4) 
These are the mass terms associated with three massive gauge bosons. 
To diagonalize the masses, we note that, because the kinetic terms for B/-, and W: are 
canonically normalized, we should only rotate and not rescale the gauge bosons in the 
diagonalization. Thus we define

the weak and hypercharge gauge groups, the Higgs boson h does not. Expanding out the 
Lagrangian, we find that the terms involving the Higgs boson are

gives v = 247 GeV, as discussed below in Section 29.4. In Chapter 31, we will discuss 
the renormalization conditions of the electroweak theory in more detail, in the Context of 
precision tests of the Standard Model. 
29.2 Unitarity and gauge boson scattering 
Before discussing fermions, we can answer one of the most important questions about 
electroweak symmetry breaking: what good is the physical Higgs boson? 
To see the problem that the Higgs boson solves, consider scattering of longitudinal W 
bosons off longitudinal Z bosons. We would like to evaluate 
(29.18) 
This is a physical process since the longitudinal polarizations of the Wand Z bosons 
are on-shell asymptotic states. Recall that for a momentum pJ.I. = (E, 0, O,Pz), the two 
transverse polarizations are E~1 = (0,1,0,0) and E~2 = (0,0,1,0) and the longitudinal 
polarization is E'i, = ~ (Pz, 0, 0, E). These all satisfy Ei . P = 0 and Ei . Ej = -6ij. At high 
energy, E = Jp~ + m 2 --; Pz, and so E'i, --; ~pJ.I., which will be the origin of dangerolls 
;:,,~ growing amplitudes. Unfortunately, setting E'i, = 
~pJ.I. only works at the leading order 
in 1.., since it violates EL . P = 0 and we will need to work to subleading order. We take 
m 
our longitudinal polarization vectors to be

CoUplings. Nevertheless, the matlix element still seems to grow with energy. 
In Chapter 24 we discussed some implications of unitarity. In particular, in Sec-
tion 24.1.5 we derived the partial wave unitarity bound which says that amplitudes cannot

to show that perturbative unitmity is violated for ECM 2:, 
00 GeV. That is it lVould b e 
violated, if there were no Higgs boson. 
To be clear, this bound does not imply that a theory without a Higgs is not unital' 
only that scattering amplitudes cannot be calculated reliably in perturbation theory. Sin:~ 
M ::::; 1 at E CM ::::; 800 GeV at tree-level, it is logical that loop amplitudes could be 
cv 1 as well. When loop and tree amplitudes m'e the same size, perturbation theory breaks 
down. Of course, we already knew that the theory with massive vector bosons Was noo_ 
renormalizable, so that loops could become important. The unitarity bound says that loops 
must become important at this scale and perturbation theory must break down. 
Now, let us see how the physical Higgs boson comes to the rescue. There is only OOe 
Higgs exchange diagram, in the t-channel. It gives

(29.28) 
This is exactly what would result from taking 9 --> 0 and mw ~ 0 holding v = 2 mt 
fixed in the full Lagrangian. Indeed, since the longitudinal modes/Goldstone bosons have 
a characteristic interaction strength of F7r , while the transverse modes interact with g, this 
limit will completely isolate the longitudinal components. 
Next, substitute H as in Eq. (29.3): 
H = exp i-

Here, w± and Z are the longitudinal modes for W: and Z. 
By the way, the interactions among the Goldstone bosons here are identical to the 
pion interactions in the Chiral Lagrangian. Indeed, for the Goldstone bosons, one only 
needs a nonlinear sigma model, which can be derived using the CCWZ method dis-
cussed in Sections 8.7 and 28.2.4: start with the unitary gauge Lagrangian and replace 
WIL ~ U-1WILU + U-1DILU, where U = exp(2iKaTa/V ). Then, taking 9 ~ 0 hold-
ing v fixed brings us to the nonlinear sigma model (h = 0 above). Thus, the vacuum 
expectation value v = (h) plays the role that F7T ~ (qq) 1/3 ~ AQCD plays in the Chiral 
Lagrangian. 
For WLZL ~ WLZL, all we need is the contact interaction on the last line. This 
looks just like a current-current interaction in scalar QED. There are (~) = 6 possible 
contractions, giving 
M4(W+Z ~ w+z) = - 3~2 [ (Pl - p2)IL(P3 - P4)i"" + (Pl + P4t(p2 + P3t] = :2' 
(29.31) 
Which agrees with the direct calculation of longitudinal gauge boson scattering above in 
the high-energy limit.

29.3 Fermion sector 
Next we discuss how to couple the eIectroweak gauge bosons to fermions. It turns out that 
the theory of weak interactions is chiral and maximally parity-violating: the SU (2) gauge 
bosons only couple to left-handed fermions. As we will discuss in Section 29.4, this fact 
was originally deduced from observations at low energy, well before the Wand Z bosons 
were produced in colliders. At this point, there is unfortunately no compelling explanation 
of why the weak interaction must couple this way. In this section, we simply present the 
model. 
In the Standard Model, the left-handed leptons (e, Ve, fl , v/1>' T, vr ) pair up to trans-
form under SU(2) in the fundamental representation, as do the left-handed quarks 
(d, u, s, c, b, t). There are three generations of SU(2) doublet pairs of quarks and leptons: 
(29.33) 
Here i = 1,2,3 indexes the generation. These all transform as left-handed Weyl spinors, 
i.e. in the (~, 0) representation of the Lorentz group. The right-handed fermions we index 
by the first-generation label: 
ek = {eR' flR, TR}, vk = {VeR' V/1>R, VrR} , 
uk = {UR' CR, tR} , dk = {dR , SR, bR} . 
(29.34) 
These all happen to be SU(2) singlets so they are uncharged under the weak interaction. 
They transform as right-handed Weyl spinors under the Lorentz group. It is worth remark-
ing that right-handed neutrinos have not yet been observed, but we include them here in 
case they do exist. Neutrinos are discussed in Section 29.3.4 below. 
All fermions couple to the hypercharg gauge b on. We write YQ and YL for the left-
handed fields' hypercharges (which happen to be the arne ~ r each generation) and Ye, Y,,, 
Yu and Yd for the right-handed field 
hypcrcharge (which al 0 happen to be the same for 
each generation). Putting everything together, the gauge interactions are 
,C = iLi($ - igwaTa - ig'YLJ/J)Li + iQi($ - igwaTa - ig'YQJ/J)Qi

To be clear, the R subscripts in expressions such as Eq. (29.34), or the L subscripts in 
Eq. (29.33), indicate the implicit chirality of the field. Since the fermions are all left- or 
right-handed Weyl spinors, it would be technically correct to replace QifftQi -t Q! (j /.JJjtQi 
and ukfftuk -t U~<T jtojtuk. However, since we will almost always be performing compu-
tations in the broken phase, where the left- and right-handed spinors combine into a single 
Dirac representation, it is generally easier to use the Dirac-spinor notation from the start, 
where Land R indicate implicit chirality projectors. That is, QifftQi = Qh°"ljtOjtPLQi 
with PL = ~(1 - "15) and uk fftuk = u~"I°"ljtojt PRuk with PR = !(1 + "15). 
Because hypercharge is a U(I) group, the hypercharges could be arbitrary real num-
bers. To find out what the actual hypercharges are in the Standard Model, we can use 
the known electric charges. First isolating the neutral gauge bosons, W~ and Bjt, and 
then changing to the Ajt - Zjt basis using Eq. (29.5) gives, for the electron and neutrino 
couplings,

(29.36) 
Since the electric charges are the coefficients of the coupling to the photon, we can read 
off from this equation the relationship between the hypercharges and the electric charges. 
Using that the electron is conventionally defined to have charge - 1, we see that YL = - ~ 
and Ye = -1. This implies that 1/L is neutral, in agreement with nature, and for 1/R to 
be neutral we also need Yv = O. Similarly using that the up quark has charge ~ and 
the d wn quark. ha charge - 1 we need YQ = !, y;, = ~ and Yd = -1. In summary, 
the quantum number of the lepton and quark field in the Standard Model are shown in 
Table 29.1. 
An obvious question arises: If the hypercharge could have been arbitrary real num-
bers, why did they turn out to have simple rational number ratio'? How do we know that 
the electric charge of the up quark is not - 0.6666665 tim s the electric charge of the

electron, rather than -
~ times it? Even such a small deviation would have important cOn_ 
sequences for our universe, since atoms w llid not be exactly n utral and there are a I 
of atoms! The answer is another profound and eamiful result of quantum field theoro~ 
electric charges must be quantized to guarantee consi tency of the quantum theory. It tur~' 
out that, given the particle content of the Standard Model, the hypercharges must satisf S 
certain constraints. In particular, YL + 3YQ = 0, a result we prove in Section 30.4. ThiY 
forces the electric charge of the electron to be exactly three times the electric charge of th: 
down quark and exactly opposite to the charge of the proton. 
29.3.1 Neutral currents 
-
The relationship between the hypercharge and the electric charge can be written in more 
general notation. A representation of SU(2) weak x U(l)y has some matrix T 3 associ_ 
ated with ~V~ and a number Y associated with Bw In the fundamental repreSentation 
of SU(2), T 3 = T3 = ~ (~ 
~l)' but we can allow for more general possibilities. There 
are a continuously infinite number of representations of U(l)y since 'ljJ ---> eiaY'ljJ leaves 
i1f; ($ - iY g' $) 'ljJ invariant for any Y E R Then, the part of the covariant derivative 
involving T3 and Y is 
DJ.L = 0J.L - igW;T3 - ig' BJ.LY1 
= 01" - ieAI" (T3 + Yll) - ieZI" (cot BwT3 - tan BwYll) , 
(29.37) 
where 1 is the identity matrix acting on the n-dimensional vector space on which T 3 acts 
in a given representation. So Q = T3 + Y1 measures the electric charge. For example, 
(29.38) 
shows that the left-handed electron has charge -1. 
It is sometimes helpful to write the neutral gauge boson interactions with general fields 
'ljJl and 'ljJ~ as 
£: = i1f;i ($ - igW3T 3 - ig' $Y/) 'ljJi + i1f;~ ($ - ig' $Yt) 'ljJ~, 
(29.39) 
which is a generalization of Eq. (29.35). We then rewrite this in terms of neutral currents 
that couple to the Z boson and photon as

(29.44) 
where we have used Qi = T3 + Y with T3 giving 0 when acting on right-handed states. 
29.3.2 Fermion masses and mixing angles 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, we have to discuss fermion masses. In fact, at this point we do not really have a left-
and a right-handed electron, but rather two separate unrelated fields that happen to have 
the same electric charge. In QED, left- and right-handed fermions were connected by a 
Dirac mass term. However, we now see that a mass term like CLen explicitly breaks SU(2) 
invariance, and thus is forbidden. To write down an electron mass, we can use the Higgs 
doublet. Then the masses appear only after electroweak symmetry breaking. For example, 
the term 
(29.45) 
will generate a mass term -me(!~LeR + eRed, with me = -J2v after H gets a vev. With 
this construction, the charged leptons and the down-type quarks (d, s, b) will get masses, 
and no additional breaking of SU(2) is required. 
To give mass to the remaining fermions, we can use LU2H*. To see that LU2H* is SU(2) 
invariant, we note that, since Hand L are fundamentals under SU(2), oH = ~()kUkH and 
5L = ~()kakL. Thus, 
o(L H*) 
i () L 
* H* 
i () L t 
H* 
0'2 
= -2 k a2uk 
- 2 k aka2 
= O. 
(29.46) 
In the last step we have used Eq. (10.130), aJ U2 + a2Uj = 0, whose complex conjugate 
along with 0'2" = -0'2 from Eq. (10.128) implies Eq. (29.46). Thus, we define 
H- -' H* 
= 2U2 
, 
(29.47) 
which transforms in the fundamental representation of SU(2) and has hypercharge -~ . 
Then we can write -yLii VR as a term that gives a mass to the neutrino (or the up-type 
quarks). 
We will focus on quarks first and then on leptons and neutrino masses in Section 29.3.4. 
Including all three generations, indexed by i and j (so that uk = (UR' CR, tR) and so on) 
we then have

.c. 
(29.48) 
Note that each term is SU(3) x SU(2) x U(l) invariant. 
In Eq. (29.48) there are two 3 x 3 Yukawa matrices, which contain a lot of parameters for 
just a few masses. In fact, if it were not for the gauge interactions, we could just diagonalize 
these matrices and the masses would be the only physical parameters. Fortunately, even 
with the gauge interactions, there is still a lot of redundancy in the Yukawa couplings. For 
example, the Yukawa matrices are general complex matrices, not necessarily Hermitian. 
So, for one generation, it might look like we have complex masses, mfhqR, m E <C. This 
595

is obviously an illusion since we can always redefine our fields by a phase, for exal11pl

Now we can freely change basis for the right-handed quarks by dR -) KddR and UR --? 
KuUR and the left-handed quarks by UL -) UuUL and dL -+ UddL. This removes the 
U and the K matrices from the Yukawa terms, leaving the diagonal mass matrices Mu 
and Ald. This is known as going to the mass basis. In the mass basis, the mass terms are 
then just 
(29.53) 
where mj and mj are the diagonal elements of :i2J..Id and :i2Afu respectively. Note that 
there is still a residual U (1)6 global symmetry, with six angles OJ and (3j, under which 
(29.54) 
There is no sum on j in these transformations. This symmetry has implications for CF 
violation, which we will discuss shortly. 
The kinetic terms are, of course, also modified by this basis change. The gauge boson 
interactions do not mix families in the original, flavor basis, where the Lagrangian is

where V = U! Ud • Thus, all of the interesting mixing effects are given by a single matrix, 
(29.57) 
known as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. 
The CKM matrix is a complex unitary matrix, and thus has nine real degrees of freedom. 
If V were real, it would be an 0(3) matrix, with three degrees of freedom. These are the 
three rotation angles. Thus there are three angles and six phases in V. However, we can 
use the U(1)6 symmetry in Eq. (29.54), under which the masses are invariant, to set some 
phases to zero. Under these transformations, V generally transforms. However, if all the 
rotations are the same, Goj = (3j = e, then V is unchanged. Thus we can only eliminate five 
phases this way, leaving overall four degrees of freedom: three angles and one phase. If we 
call the three angles e12 , e23 and e13 , corresponding to rotations in the ij-flavor planes, 
and the phase 6, the most general CKM matrix can be written as

where Cij == cos eij and Sij == sin eij . This has become a standard parametrization. The 
numerical values for the angles and phase are e12 = 13.02° ± 0.04°, e23 = 2.36° ± 
0.08°, e13 = 0.20° ± 0.02° and 6 = 69° ± 5° [Particle Data Group (Beringer et al.), 
2012]. 
Note that all the rotation angles are relatively small. Thus, the mass and flavor bases are 
fairly close and the CKM matrix is nearly diagonal. To a good approximation, e23 and e13 
are negligible, and the biggest one, e12 , gives all the flavor mixing. It is sometimes helpful 
to abbreviate this fact with an approximate parametrization in terms of A

This is known as the Wolfenstein parametrization. The angle ()12 is known as the 
Cabibbo angle. The Cabibbo angle is the rotation angle between the first two gener a-

the CKM malrix can be taken real. As we will see in 
e Ii n 29. below, if the Cl<M 
matrix is real, there can be no CF violation. Historically, CF violation was observed in 
the kaon system well before the third generation was discovered (even before charm Was 
discovered), and a third generation was predicted as necessary for CP violation. We discuss 
this more below. 
29.3.3 The unitarity triangle 
In the Standard Model, the CKM matrix is unitary by construction. However, if there were 
a fourth generation, the restriction of the CKM matrix to the three-generation subsector 
would not be unitary. Thus, testing the CKM matrix for unitarity assuming three genera-
tions is a way to indirectly look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In practice, we try 
to measure all the CKM elements separately to check whether unitarity in fact holds. The 
current best measured values are [Particle Data Group (Beringer et al.), 2012]

Precision flavor measurements mapped to the unitarity triangle [CKM fitter group (Charles , '@fjtU'* 
et a/.), 2012]. Length of the bottom edge has been normalized to 1, as compared to Fig. 
29.1, by dividing all edge lengths by Vcd Vel;. 
This unitarity constraint can be represented as a closed triangle in the complex plane, as 
shown in Figure 29.1. 
The lengths of the sides of the unitarity triangle measure flavor mixing and the angles 
of the triangle are sensitive to C P violation. Indeed, if all the CKM elements were real, 
the triangle would collapse to a line. Thus, we define a quantity J as twice the area of the 
(non-rescaled) triangle: 
(29.62)

bined into a global fit for the unitarity triangle. There are public numerical programs

29.3.4 Neutrinos 
---
Although neutrinos are very light, they are in fact massive. Neutrinos carry no ele c-
tric charge (hence their name). If we assume that both left- and right-handed neutrinos 
exist, then neutrino masses c~n ~e generated after electroweak symmetry breaking from 
interactions of the form Y/jL'Hvk (see Eq. (29.48». Since L' and H have the same 
weak and hypercharge quantum numbers, VR must be uncharged under both the Weak 
and electromagnetic force, as in Table 29.1. We thus sometimes refer to the right-handed 
neutrinos as sterile neutrinos. The most general renormalizable mass terms in the lepton 
sector are

(29.63) 
The last term in Eq. (29.63) denotes Majorana masses for the neutrinos, which are not 
forbidden by electroweak symmetry. In this term, v'R = 
V'J;()"2 is the charge conjugate 
Weyl spin or (see Section 11.3). 
If neutrinos have any quantum numbers at all, then Majorana mass terms are forbidden. 
The most natural quantum number for right-handed neutrinos to have is lepton number 
(see Section 30.5.1). That is, if right-handed neutrinos carry lepton number, then Majorana 
masses are forbidden and the masses must be Dirac. 
With neutrinos, we often go back and forth between Dirac spin or notation and Weyl 
spin or notation. Normally (as for the electron) we construct Dirac spinors out of inde-
pendent left- and right-handed Weyl spinors, 'I/J = (~~). As discussed in Section 11.3, 
we can also construct Dirac spinors out of single Weyl spinors as 'I/J R = 
(iU~;R) or 
'I/J L = (. V L *). Then, Dirac and Majorana mass terms can be written in a uniform 
ZU2vL 
notation as (focusing on one generation for simplicity) 
-
M -
Lv,mass = -m'I/JL'l/JR - 2'I/JR'l/JR. 
(29.64) 
In this notation, 'I/J Land 'I/J R can mix. Thus, the mass eigenstates are linear combinations 
that diagonalize the matrix (~ ;;) . As you showed in Problem 11.9, the physical masses 
are V 
m 2 + i 1Y12 ± ~ M. In the limit that M » m, one mass is mheavy ~ A1 and the other 
2 
is mlight ~ r;:;I 
«
mheavy' In particular, if one takes the Dirac masses to be electroweak 
scale, m ~ 100 GeV, and the Majorana masses to be very high, M ~ lvIp ] ~ 1019 GeV, 
then one finds mJight ~ 10-6 eV. This explanation of the lightness of neutrino masses is 
called the see-saw mcchllni m: a 
f goes up, m goes down. 
Why should the Majorana masses Mij be so large? On the one hand, the Majorana 
mass te1m are dimen ion 3 and bence super-renormalizable. So, following the Wilsonian 
RG picture ( ectioll 25.2) one expecls them to be UV sensitive. On the other hand, in the 
limit that A1ij = 0, the Lagrangian has a custodial symmetry, lepton number (or its non-
anomalous cousin B - L, see Section 30.5.1). Thus, radiative corrections to the Majorana 

29.3 Fermion sector 
-----------------------------------------------
masses will be propOltional to the Majorana masses themselves. In other words, in a the-
ory with right-handed neutrinos, it is technically natural (see Box 22.1) for the Majorana 
J)1asSes to be small. 
To understand the largeness of the see-saw scale, an important observation is that one 
does not need right-handed neutrinos at all to give neutrinos mass. If we allow non-
renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian, then neutrino masses can be produced from a 
dimension-5 term: 
(29.65) 
Such a term is in fact generated if we integrate out the right-handed neutrinos in Eq. (29.67) 
(see Problem 29.6). If the mass-eigenstate sterile right-handed neutrinos are very heavy, 
a dimension-3 mass term, like that in Eq. (29.64) is indistinguishable from a dimension-5 
mass term, like that in Eq. (29.65). Since right-handed neutrinos have never been observed, 
a model without them is in a sense simpler. In addition, there is no custodial symmetry 
when these dimension-5 terms are turned off. Thus, one expects these terms to be generated 
at least by quantum gravity at the Planck scale. In other words, in a theory without right-
handed neutrinos, the left-handed neutrinos naturally have masses parametrically smaller 
than the weak scale due to the see-saw mechanism. 
Regardless of whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac, or whether the masses come 
from operators of dimension 3, 4 or 5, the only neutrinos we can ever measure are left-
handed. Since left-handed neutrinos only interact via the weak force, it is more natural to 
work in the flavor basis than in the mass basis. We denote by VL e , VL!J. and VLT the left-
handed electron, muon and tauon neutrinos respectively. In the flavor basis, the couplings 
to the T1' boson are diagonal (but the masses are not): 
(29.66) 
The mass eigenstates are related to these by a unitary transformation. We write VL1, VL2 
and VL 3 for the mass eigenstates. Then

Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix. It the lepton analog ofthe CKM

Note that 1, 2, 3 refer to mass eigenstates defined in terms of flavor eigenstates by this 
matrix. We do not assume that m l < m2 < m3· 
As with the CKM matrix, the PNMS matrix contains three mixing angles, el2 , e13 and 
()23 (note that although we use the same notation, these angles are different from the CKM

mixing angles). The phase 6 is the Dirac phase. If neutrino masses are Dirac, there is onl 
this phase. However, if there is a Majorana component to the neutrino masses, then tw~ 
additional phases, Ct12 and Ct31, are possible. You can show why exactly two extra phases 
occur in Problem 29.6. Thus there are three masses, lliree mixing angles and one Or three 
phases in the neutrino sector. 
It is very difficult to measure masses and mixing angles in neutrinos. Neutrino masses 
were first observed indirectly using solar neutrinos (neutrinos coming from the SUn). 
Practically all of the neutrinos produced by the Sun should be produced as electron (flavor 
eigenstate) neutrinos. However, the number of electron neutrinos observed on Earth that 
came from the Sun was found to be only around one-third of the number expected. This 
was the solar neutrino problem. The resolution is that (flavor eigenstate) neutrinos oscil_ 
late as they propagate through space. Indeed, it is only in the mass basis that the neutrino 
propagators are diagonal (see Problem 29.7). The solar neutrino problem was finally con-
vincingly resolved by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in 2001, which found that 
35% of the solar neutrinos were lie and 65% were lIf.L or liT' This confirmed not only that 
neutrinos oscillate, but that the solar models which predicted their production rate Were 
correct. 
Atmospheric neutrinos are those produced by cosmic rays. Cosmic rays (mostly pro-
tons) hit nuclei in the atmosphere, producing pions, which decay as 1r-
--) j.L- vf.L -) 
(e-lIellf.L) Vw Thus, one expects a 2:1 ratio of muon to electron neutrinos coming from 
the atmosphere. Deviations from this ratio constrain other neutrino mixing angles and 
masses. Neutrino oscillations are also measured using reactor neutrinos (produced by 
nuclear reactors; mostly lIf.L) and accelerator neutrinos (produced by particle accelerators; 
mostly ve). 
Neutrino oscillations are only sensitive to differences in squares of neutrino masses. 
Solar oscillations give ~m~l = m~ - mf = (7.50 ± 0.20) x 10-5 eV2, while atmospheric 
oscillations give l~m~21 = Im§ -
m~ I = 0.00232 ± 0.00012 e V2. These differences 
are consistent willi either m3 > m2 > ml (normal hierarchy) or m2 > ml > m3 
(inverted hierarchy). The mixing angles are sin2(2e12) = 0.857 ± 0.024, sin2(2e23) > 
0.95 and sin2(2e13 ) = 0.098 ± 0.013. The Dirac CP phase J has not been measured 
as of this writing (but may be soon), nor have the Majorana CP phases. To measure the 
Majorana CP phases, one would first have to measure that neutrinos are Majorana, which 
is extraodinarily challenging on its own. Majorana neutrinos would imply lepton number 
violation, for example in neutrino-less double j1-decay (see Problem 11 .9). 
29.4 The 4-Fermi theory 
Well before the electroweak unification was understo d, it etIective low-energy descrip-
tion, the 4-Fermi theory, was proven to give a very accurate phenomenological de cripLion 
of the weak interactions. Precision measurement at low energy gave indications o;f how 
heavy the Wand Z bosons should be. They al 0 incticated that the theory sh uld in olve 
vector currents (V) such as ijyyf.L'ljJ and axial vector Current (A) llch as ijryl-''Ys7/J. Tn fact. 

29,4 The 4-Fermi theory 
the structure of the electroweak theory was deduced from the V - A (pronounced "V 
minus />:') structure of the 4-Fermi theory. Writing V - A = ,/-' - ,/-',5 = 2,/-' PL, with 
PL = ~ (1 - ,5), we see that the V - A structure in the low-energy theory corresponds to 
a chiral theory in which weak interactions involve only left-handed fermions. J

To derive the 4-Fermi theory, let us start with the lepton sector treating the neutrinos

(29.73) 
Using the 4-Fermi Lagrangian gives a CUlTent-CUlTent interaction amplitude that is identi-
cal to Eq. (29.72) for p2 « m~v' Thus, at low energy, the weak theory reduces to a set of 
4-Fermi interactions among leptons (and quarks) with a universal strength given by GF . 
In particular, the muon decay rate is easy to calculate from the 4-Fermi theory. In the 
limit m/-, » me, we find (cf. Problem 5.3) 
(29.74) 
Actually, there were some confusing indications through the 1950s that also scalar currents (S). such as 1jJ1jJ, 
or tensor currents (T), such as 1jJa!,v1jJ, were involved. Only the vector and axial vector currents can be easily 
embedded in a spontaneously broken renormalizable gauge theory; thus, careful measurements of spin and 
angular momentum in low-energy experiments were important inspirations for the electroweak theory.

From the measured muon lifetime, TJ-L = 2.197fl.s; this lets us deduce GF 
10- 5 GeV- 2. This determines that the electroweak vev is 
v = 247 GeV, 
l.166 ><

sinBw < 1, we also know that mw = Q2 ~() > 37.4 GeV and mz =

Thus, simply from the muon lifetime, we already knew in the 1960s that the H' and Z D1ust 
be quite heavy. Having an idea where to look helped motivate the design of the Super Pro-
ton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN, with which the liV and Z bosons were discovered in 1983. 
Quarks can be studied with charged-current interactions in the 4-Fermi theory, much 
like leptons. The only complication is that now flavor mixing is an issue. Including the first 
two generations, the weak currents are expanded to 
(29.76) 
where the· ., are the terms in Eq. (29.74), and similarly for J;. These mediate processes 
such as {3-decay, for example n -+ p+ e- De. From precision measurements of radioactive 
decays and from rates for kaon decay, such as K+ -+ 7Toe+ve (here, K+ = .5U), it Was 
deduced that G F in these processes is consistent with the leptonic measurements, and that 
sin Be = 0.22. 
The neutral-current interactions, mediated by Z-boson exchange, are much harder 
to measure directly in the lepton sector. The first observation was in 1973 when vp'e-
elastic scattering was observed. This was a great test of the electroweak theory, consistent 
with a Z boson, but it only gave a very poor measure of mz and Bw. It was not until 
the mid 1990s that Bw could be measured from this process directly. We now have very 
precise measurements: mw = 80 GeV, mz = 91.2 GeV and sin2Bw = 0.21. Moreover, 
measuring these quantities in multiple ways has provided important tests of the Standard 
Model and constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model physics (see Chapter 31). 
The Z boson couples to linear combinations of the J~ and QED currents. The

4-Fermi theory can then be written as

There is no J#MJ#M 4-Fermi interaction since the photon is massless and so, unlike the TV 
and Z bosons, its propagator can never be approximated by a constant. 

29.5 CP violation 
-
One immediate prediction of £ 4F is that, since the neutral current is flavor diagonal, 
there will be no flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes, such as 8 -4 ueve . 
This is an obvious result the way we have set things up, but it is not at all obvious without 
an electroweak theory. Indeed, historically, in the 1960s it was not at all clear why there 
were no FCNCs. In the 1960s the only hadrons known were made up of u, d and 8 quarks. 
The charm quark was then predicted to exist based on the absence of neutral currents, as 
we will now explain. When charm was discovered in 1974 the electroweak theory was 
spectacularly confirmed. 
To see why charm is required to avoid FCNCs, let us forget about leptons and consider 
a theory with only two generations of quarks. Then there is only one mixing angle, (}e, so 
we can choose a basis so that u and c quarks are flavor and mass eigenstates, while the 
left-handed d and 8 quarks are mixed. Then the two left-handed doublets are 
(29.80) 
The electromagnetic current is flavor diagonal for any number of quarks, so we will ignore 
it. The neutral current coming from weak interactions is 
J~ = fry/1.u + (cos (}ed + sin (}e8h/1. (cos (}ed + sin (}e8) 
+ c,/1.c+ (Cos(}e8 - sin (}ed),/1.(COs (}ed - sin (}e8) 
= u,/1.u + c,/1.c + d,/1.d + 8,/1.8, 
(29.81) 
where we have dropped the L subscripts for readability. This current is flavor diagonal, as 
expected. Now, suppose there were no charm quark. Then there would be no Q2 and the 
neutral current would have a non-vanishing cross term cos (}e sin (}ed,/1. s, implying d8 -4 
j.L+ j.L- and KG -4 p,+ p,- . So Glashow, Iliopoulos and Maiani (GIM) predicted that there 
must be a charm quark so that the flavor-changing process would cancel. The absence of 
FCNCs works for any number of generations, and is known as the GIM mechanism. It is 
a general consequence of the T 3 generator of SU(2) commuting with rotations in flavor 
space, as can be seen in Eq. (29.79). 
29.5 CP violation 
That parity is violated in the weak theory is obvious: the left-handed fields couple differ-
ently from the right-handed fields. Parity violation is manifest in nuclear ,6-decay, which 
always produces left-handed electrons. However, one might imagine that, while the uni-
verse is not invariant under reflection in a mirror, it might still be invariant under that 
reflection accompanied by the interchange of particles and antiparticles. This is C P invari-
ance. We now know that C P invariance is violated by rare processes involving hadrons. 
We call this weak CP violation. There is another possible form of CP violation, called 
strong CP violation, which is expected but has not been observed. The non-observation 
is known as the strong C P problem. We will now discuss both of these aspects of C P 
physics.

29.5.1 Weak CP violation

We derived how C and P act on fields and spinor bilinears in Chapter 11. Under the 
combination C P, we found: 
1!J(ljJj (t , x) --7 +1!JjWi (t, -x), 
ifii'lWj (t, x) --7 -1!Jj''lWi (t, -x) , 
1!Ju/l·Wj(t, x) --7 +1!Jj)J.Wi(t, -x), ifidl/ 5Wj(t, x) --71!Jj ir 5Wi(t, -x), 
(29.82) 
(29.83) 
which we can use to check which terms in the Standard Model Lagrangian can violate C p. 
We showed above that one can perform chiral rotations on the left- and right-handed 
ferlllions of the Standard Model so that the quark masses are diagonal and the mixing is 
moved to the CKM matrix V. The relevant part of the electroweak Lagrangian is

(29.85) 
Thus, the Standard Model Lagrangian is invariant under CP if V* = V, that is, if V is 
real. Thus: 
A non-zero phase in the CKM matrix implies CP violation. 
There is an easier way to see that complex numbers imply C P violation. We know that 
any term in any local Lagrangian must be CPT invariant., which i true with real or complex 
coefficients. Since T sends i --7 -i in addition to whatever it does on field 
if a term is 
T invariant for real coefficients, it must be T vioJatlllg for imaginary coefficient. By CPT 
invariance, we conclude that imaginary coefficients imply CP violation. 
Recall that, in the flavor basis, all the flavor structure is in the Yukawa matrices. Consider 
the up-type quark (uct) mass terms: 
.cYuk = - ~ 
[ULYuuR + uRYJUL] = - 2~ [u(Yu + Y~)u + u(Yu - YJ) r Su] . 
(29.86) 
Under CP, UiUj --7 UjUi and UilsUj --7 - Ujl5Ui (along with x --7 -X), so

Thus, again we see that the Lagrangian is C P invariant if the coefficients are real.

Whether or not a matrix is real is not a basis-invariant statement. Indeed, in the flavor 
basis where the W interactions are flavor diagonal and the mass matrix is complex, V = n, 
there is still CP violation. Conversely, even if the mass matrix were diagonal, and V were 
complex, there might still be no C P violation if some residual chiral rotation could remove 
the phase. For example, if one of the quarks is massless, this is always true. So it would be 
useful to have a basis-independent measure of C P violation. 
Now recall that we relate the Yukawa couplings to the diagonal mass matrices via 
(29.88) 
where Md = ~diag(md' m s , mb), Mu = ~diag(mu, me, mt) and V = UJUd. Thus, 
if Uu = Ud , then V = n with no flavor or CP violation. Before, we used the freedom 
to rotate right-handed fields without changing the weak interactions to remove Kd and 
Ku. We could equally well have rotated dR -> K duldR and UR -> KuUJUR so that 
Yd == udMdul and Yu = UuA1uUJ, which makes the Yukawa matrices Hermitian. So 
let us assume Yu and Yd are Hermitian, without loss of generality. If Yu and Yd could 
be simultaneously diagonalized, then V = n and there is no CP violation. Thus, CP 
violation is all encoded in the commutator 
(29.89) 
The matrix C is traceless and Hermitian because Yu and Yd are Hermitian. Thus, it is 
natural to look at its determinant as the obvious basis-invariant quantity: 
where, for any i, j, k and l, 
Im(VijVklViiVkj) = J~ cikmcjln' 
(29.91) 
m,n 
where Cijk is the antisymmetric 3-index tensor. This is a fancy way of saying 
where these products are all equal due to the unitarity of the CKM matrix. J is known as 
the Jarlskog invariant. In terms of the standard parametrization, 
(29.93) 
J has a nice geometric interpretation as well: it is twice the area of the unitarity triangle, 
as in Eq. (29.62). 
The important point about the Jarlskog invariant is that it vanishes if and only if there is 
no CP violation. That is, 
All weak CP violation in the Standard Model is proportional to Imdet[Yu , Yd]. 
We have already seen that if V is real there is no C P violation. If V is real then J = 0 
and so det C = O. Also, we note that if either two up-type or two down-type quarks are 

608 
Weak interactions 
degenerate then det C = 0 as well. For degenerate masses we get an extra phase rotat' 
IOn 
to remove the C P phase. 
Note that since det C has many factors of masses mi « v, it is in general quite Sll1all 
Thus, even if the C P phase is large, the physical manifestations of C P violation are boun . 
to be small. Another way to see this is to observe that if there were only two generation: 
then one could remove all the phases completely. Thus, any CP-violating effect in th~ 
Standard Model must involve all three generations. Consider, for example, the observed 
C P violation in kaon decays such as K+ ~ 71'+ 71' - . One might imagine that, at the quark 
level, this is just s ~ udu through a IV exchange. However, such a Feynman diagram 
only involves the first two generations, and thus cannot explain the observed CP violatio n. 
Instead, it must be a loop-induced process. But the CKM elements coupling either of the 
first two generations to the third are small, thus the amount of observed CP viOlation is 
going to be suppressed by products of small CKM elements. 
29.5.2 Measurements of weak CP violation 
There are lots of ways to measure the one CP phase in the Standard Model. That all these 
measurements are consistent is an important check on the CKM matrix and often provides 
stringent constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. We will give only a brief 
summary of these measurements. 
Historically, the first measurement of C P violation was through decays of neutral kaons. 
Kaons were discovered in 1946 through cosmic rays, and were "strange" because they had 
long lifetimes - they can only decay through strangeness-violating weak interactions. Their 
quark content is KO = 3d and KO = (is, which are flavor eigenstates, but CP conjugates 
of each other. The C P eigenstates are 
(29.94) 
with Kl CP-even and K2 CP-odd. Thus, to the extent that CP is a good symmetry, only 
Kl can decay to 71'1f, which is a CP-even final state, while K2 must decay to 71'71'71'. This 
makes K2 live much longer (52 ns) than Kl (0.089ns). What Christenson, Cronin, Fitch 
and Turlay famously found in 1964 was that the long-lived kaon sometimes did decay to 
1f71', about 0.2% of the time, indicating CP violation. If the Hamiltonian commuted with 
CP, Kl and K2 would be the mass eigenstates, but since CP is violated, these states can 
mix with each other. The mass eigenstates in the Kr/ K2 system can be written as 
(29.95) 
with E = 0 if C P is conserved. Christenson et al. found that E rv 2 X 10- 3 . The most 
precise value today is lEI = (2.228 ± 0.011) x 10- 3 . 
The kaon system is actually a little more complicated, since it is also possible that the 
CP eigenstate K2 could decay to 71'71' directly. To be more precise, if all the CP violation 
were due to mixing between Kl and K2 (this is called indirect CP violation of cP

In addition, there can be direct CP violation, also called CP violation from decay, for 
which we introduce a new parameter f ' with M(K2 -t 1f1f) ex c'. Arguments that exploit 
the approximate isospin invariance of the meson system (see Chapter 28) show that

Experimentally, it is found that I '~:~ I = 0.9951 ± 0.0008 so that Re ( ~) 
(1.65 ± 0.26) x 10- :>. It is also possible to measure a third type of C P violation, from 
the interference between mixing and decay, which would show up in Im(E). Cunent 
measurements give Im( E) = (1.57 ± 0.02) x 10- 3. 
It is not possible to calculate theoretically c or f' due to the non-perturbative QCD effects 
in the required matrix elements. But it is also not hard to see if the measurements are 
roughly consistent with theory. Since CP violation requires three generations, at the per-
turbative level, there must be loops involving top or bottom quarks involved in the decays. 
For example, we could have a VV loop and an intermediate top quark for the S -t udu 
decay. This would be suppressed by vtd ~ 0.084. The mixing can be estimated from box 
diagrams. The result is that the sizes of f and f' are apparently consistent with the CKM 
paradigm. 
For many years C P violation had only been measured in kaon decays and mixing 
(including also additional modes, such as KL ---+ p,+v,,1f-). The advent of B physics 
opened up a whole new world of CP-violating observables and has provided important 
checks on the CKM framework and strong constraints on new physics. CP violation has 
been observed in decays, first in B O ---+ K +1f- then in other modes, such as B O -t 1f+1f- , 
EO -t 1]Ko*, B+ -t pO K+, and also in interference B -t J/'ljJKs, B -t r/ K s, etc. So 
far, to the extent that we can connect these measurements to the CKM matrix (there are 
sometimes large theory uncertainties), everything seems perfectly consistent with a single 
CP phase. However, beyond-the-Standard-Model physics in CP violation could be just 
around the corner! 
29.5.3 Strong CP violation 
There is one more possible source of CP violation in the Standard Model. Sometimes 
global chiral symmetries, such as 1/) -t ei!5e'IjJ, that are symmetries of a classical 
Lagrangian are not symmetries of a quantum theory. When this happens we say the symme-
tries are anomalous. As we will discuss in the next chapter, anomalies can be understood 
as arising in situations in which a classical action is invariant under a symmetry trans-
formation, but the path integral measure is not. For example, if we perform a chiral 
transformation on a quark, we find

are allowed. Here F:v , W:v and B!J,v are the SU(3), SU(2) and U(l) field strengths 
respectively. In fact, not only are these terms allowed, but they must be included sinc~ 
they may be generated through UV-divergent loop corrections and thus the ei are needed 
to renormalize the divergences. On the other hand, since the Bi change if we perform chiral 
rotations, it is not clear whether they can have observable consequences, since observables 
must be independent of our chiral phase conventions. 
To see whether the Bi have observable consequences, let us revisit the Yukawa matrices, 
which we saw can be written as 
(29.101) 
Here, extra factors of UJ and U! have been inserted, without loss of generality. Then we 
can first perform chiral rotations on only the right-handed fields to remove Ku and Kd, 
and then perform non-chiral rotations to remove Ud and Uu ' The phase induced by the Kd 
and Ku chiral rotations is given by (see Problem 29.9)

A chiral rotation moves the phase back and forth between eQCD and BF leaving B 
unchanged. Thus, (j is a basis-independent measure of CP violation, and can be physi-
cal. (j is known as the strong CP phase. However, if det( MdMu) = 0, that is, if any of the 
quark masses vanish, then (j is again unphy..ical. 
Before discussing the strong CP phase fmUlcr, we note that the U(2) and U(l) angles 
can be removed completely by chiral rotations. We aw that rotating .Illy the right-handed 
fields can make the Yukawa couplings real, but 82 i unchanged by thel e rotations since 

29.5 CP violation 
,-----------------------------------------------------------------
right-handed fields are uncharged. Thus, we can rotate the left-handed fields only to put 
e2 into the Yukawa couplings then rotate the right-handed fields to remove it. Therefore, 
there is no basis-independent measure of CP violation for SU(2) and B2 is unphysical. 
Similarly, since neutrinos are uncharged, we can rotate them to show that the U (1) phase 
is unphysical. Thus, neither B2 nor Bl can have any physical consequences. 
We have seen that e is basis independent, and if none of the quark masses vanish, then it 
can potentially be measured. But how will it show up? Not in perturbation theory! To see 
this, note that we can write 
I-'va{3Fa Fa - 81-'K 
f 
I-'V 
o:{3 -
1-" 
(29.105) 
showing that fl-',/C<{3 F~v F~{3 is a total derivative. K I-' is known as a Chern-Simons current. 
Total derivatives never contribute in perturbation theory - the Feynman rule would have a 
factor of the sum of all momenta going into the vertex minus the momenta going out, 
which gives a factor of zero. Thus, (j can only have physical consequences through non-
perturbative effects. 
By the way, the non-perturbative effects coming from e can be thought of as due to 
configurations of gauge fields that are locally gauge equivalent to 0, but cannot be gauged 
away globally due to a topological obstruction. One can find such solutions, for example 
instantons. Unfortunately, instantons have not been used to give quantitative predictions 
for the effects of e. The problem is that integrals over instanton size are IR divergent and 
must be somehow cut off by AQCD . That AQCD should be relevant is consistent with e 
having no effect in perturbation theory: non-perturbative effects are tiny at weak coupling 
and infinitely important at large coupling. 
Although we cannot calculate the effect of e directly in QCD, we can actually make pre-
cise quantitative predictions using the Chiral Lagrangian, discussed in Chapter 28. Recall 
that the Chiral Lagrangian is a nonlinear sigma model in which the pions are embedded 
in a composite field U(x) = exp(2i7ra (X)Ta/Fn). Including the mass term, the Chiral 
Lagrangian is 
(29.106) 
where V 3 = (flu) = (dd) and M is the quark mass matrix in QCD. As we saw in Sec-
tion 28.2.2, the second term leads to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, F;m; = 
V3(mu + md). To see the dependence on () we first use our chiral rotation to remove 
the phase from the fl-'vcx{3 F:vF~{3 term in the QCD Lagrangian completely, putting 
it back in the Yukawa couplings. This leads to complex quark masses. That is, now 
M = (mu md) eiO. One immediate consequence is that the vacuum energy is now 
o dependent: 
(29.107) 
This equation indicates that different values of e correspond to different vacua, the {}-
vacua.

Weak interactions 
A more important consequence is that the neutron picks up an electric dipole mOm 
proportional to e. The calculation is not trivial, so we will only sketch it. The neutron aent 
the proton form an isospin doublet, so their couplings to the pion have to be of the forrn nd 
(29.108) 
where 'it is the proton-neutron isospin doublet. The first term is the ordinary Yukawa cou-
pling to the pseudoscalar pions, which gives rise to the Yukawa potential describing the 
strong nucle~r force among nucleons. The second term is CP-violating and must be pro-
portional to e. Upgrading isospin to SU(3) and using baryon mass relations one can Show 
that [Crewther et al., 1979]

(with the CP violation coming in at the 9rrNN vertex) generate a neutron electric dipole

(29.111) 
The current bound on the neutron EDM is IdNI < IdNI < 2.9 x 1O- 26e · cm, so that 
e < 10-10 . 
(29.112) 
The smallness of e despite the large amount of C P violation in the weak sector is known 
as the strong CP problem. 
Possible solutions to the strong C P problem include: 
• One of the quarks is massless, mu = O. Unfortunately there is no symmetry protecting 
m u = 0, since the chiral symmetry is anomalous. So m u would just have to be tuned 
to be small instead of tuning e to be small. Thus, the mu = 0 solution just moves the 
fine-tuning problem around. 
• Axions. The idea behind axions is to add fields to the Standard Model so that there 
is a new anomalous U(l) symmetry. This symmetry is known after its authors as a 
Peccei-Quinn symmetry. If this U(1)PQ is spontaneously broken, it will generate a 
new Goldstone boson, a. Then a chira! rotation can move the Goldstone boson into the 
e parameter, modifying the energy in Eq. (29.107) to 
( -

(29.l13) 
where fa is the axion decay constant. Then (a) = e and the ground state has no effec-
tive e. The excitations around this vacuum are known as axions, and additionally provide 

29.5 CP violation 
,---------------------------------------------------------
a viable dark-matter candidate. Expanding Eq. (29.113), one finds rna = m;ain , so 
that the axion decay constant is inversely proportional to the axion mass. Astrophys-
ical bounds (for example, axion emissions from red giants) require fa> 10lD GeV, 
while cosmological bounds (too many axions would overclose the universe) require 
fa < 1012 GeY. Thus, the axion should be very weakly coupled with a mass 10- 4 eV < 
rna < 10-2 eV. It is of course possible to evade these bounds with clever model 
building. 
One concern about the axion solution to the strong CP problem is that the U(l)PQ 
symmetry must be very special. For example, let ¢ denote the field whose expectation 
value breaks U(l)pQ. Since quantum gravity is non-renormalizable, we should generi-
cally include dimension n operators such as Cn M Ln ¢n + h.c. in the Lagrangian. After 
PI 
spontaneous breaking of U(l)pQ, these will contribute to the potential E(e, a) terms 
such as lenl filL cos(na + arg(cn)) which make (a) =I- e. For e to be consistent with 
MpI 
current bounds on the neutron EDM requires operators with n > 10 be forbidden (or 
have exponentially small coefficients). See [Kamionkowski and March-Russell, 1992] 
for more information. There are of course ways to build models that forbid dangerous 
operators . 
• Spontaneous C P violation. Here one supposes that, at some high scale, C P is an exact 
symmetry of nature, and is then spontaneously broken. When C P is a symmetry, the e 
term is forbidden. Thus, all the CP violation appears in the Yukawa matrices. One can 
then connect the generation of a large weak CP phase and a small strong CP phase 
to the generation of mass and mixing angles. There are many ways to do this, but no 
overwhelmingly compelling model at this point. 
29.5.4 Summary of CP violation 
We have seen that the Standard Model contains two types of C P violation: weak and 
strong. To date, only weak C P violation has been observed. In the Standard Model, one 
can describe the weak CP phase in a basis-invariant way in terms ohhe Jarlskog invariant: 
(29.l14) 
As an angle, we can also write 
(29.l15) 
Or, one can identify the CP phase with the parameter (j in the CKM parametrization in 
Eq. (29.58). This phase has been experimentally measured to be (j = 69° ± 5°. One can 
measure weak C P violation many ways: in decays, in mixing, or in interference between 
decays and mixing. Historically, C P violation was measured first in the K -7 2n decays, 
but now has been much more thoroughly tested using B mesons. 
The strong C P phase has two components. One is the eQco angle associated with

One of the great mysteries of the Standard Model is why weak CP violation is nearl 
maximal (5 ~ 7r) while strong CP violation is so small (8 « 1). Another important fa~ 
about CP violation is that it is also necessary to explain the abundance of matter OVer 
antimatter in the universe. It turns out that there is not enough C P violation in the Standard 
Model to explain this abundance. Thus, there is good reason to think that there is more to 
be learned about C P violation.

Most of the time, a symmetry of a classical theory is also a symmetry of the quantum theor 
based on the same Lagrangian. When it is not, the symmetry is said to be anomalolls. Sine: 
symmetries are extremely important for determining the structure of a theory, anomalies are 
also extremely important. In fact, anomalies have already been mentioned in two important 
contexts: in Chapter 28 they were invoked to justify why the Chiral Lagrangian was based 
on SU(2) x SU(2) ~ SU(2) and not U(2) x U(2), and in Chapter 29 they were Used 
to explain the strong CP problem. These results will be reviewed and properly justified in 
Section 30.5. 
Recall from Section 3.3 that continuous global symmetries imply conserved currents, 
through Noether's theorem. If a symmetry is anomalous then it is not actually a symmetry 
and the associated CWTent will not be conserved. Such a situation has dire consequences for 
theories in which the current couples to a massless spin-l particle, such as QED or Yang-
Mills theory. If the current to which a massless spin-l particle couples is not conserved, the 
Ward identity will be violated, unphysical longitudinal polarizations can be produced, and 
unitarity will be violated. Thus, in a unitary quantum theory, gauged symmetries (those 
with associated massless spin-l particles) must be anomaly free. It turns out that this is a 
strong requirement for a consistent quantum theory. For example, in the Standard Model, 
it forces electric charge to be quantized, and the quark and lepton charges to be related, as 
we will see in Section 30.4. 
Anomalies of symmetries associated with gauge bosons are called gauge anomalies. If 
a symmetry is not gauged, nothing goes terribly wrong if it is anomalous. That is, global 
anomalies do not lead to inconsistencies (the phrase anomaly free refers to the absence of 
gauge anomalies only). There are actually many global anomalies in the Standard Model. 
For example, baryon number conservation, that is, the symmetry that prevents quarks from 
turning into antiquarks, with associated Noether current Jtaryon = Li Qi/J1.qi, is anoma-
lous. This anomaly is allowed because there is no massless spin-l particle in the Standard 
Model that couples to Jtaryon' In fact, baryon number violation is a necessary condition 
to explain the preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. Global anoma-
lies also help explain why the r/ meson is so heavy (the U(l) problem) and generate 
one of the greatest mysteries of the Standard Model: the strong CP problem, discussed in 
Section 29.5.3. These topics are all discussed in Section 30.5. 
An important fact about anomalies is that they are infrared effects, from having mass-
less particles in the spectrum. This leads to the idea of anomaly matching: the spectrum 
of massless particles in a theory below a phase transition is strongly constrained by 
the spectrum above the transition. For example, we will show in Section 30.6 that 
anomaly matching implies that the SU(3)L x SU(3)R flavor symmetry of QCD must be 

30.1 Pseudoscalars decaying to photons 
617 
------------------------------------------------ ~ ...... 
spontaneously broken, a fact that we had to assume in our study of the Chiral Lagrangian 
jn Chapter 28. Anomaly matching provides strong constraints on the spectrum of bound 
states in strongly coupled theories. 
Another type of anomaly, one we have already seen, is that of scale invariance. QCD (in 
the absence of quark masses) is scale invariant as a classical theory, but the quantum theory 
js certainly not scale invariant. In this case, the anomaly is called the trace anomaly and is 
proportional to the ,6-function. Conformal field theories are trace-anomaly free. The study 
of conformal field theories is a fascinating subject, but beyond our scope. In this chapter 
we will focus entirely on chiral anomalies, that is, anomalies which arise in theories that 
treat left-handed and right-handed fermions differently. 
As in previous chapters we use the abbreviation (- .. ; == (0 IT { ... }I 0;. 
30.1 Pseudoscalars decaying to photons 
The way anomalies were first understood was through Feynman diagrams. This is not the 
easiest way to understand them, but it is important to show that they can be understood 
using methods you already know. We will start with the case in which a massive fermion 
runs around the loop. This avoids the ambiguities associated with massless fermions, which 
are discussed in Section 30.2. It also lets us calculate the rate for the decay 1['0 --> ii, 
which, as we will see, provides an important way to measure the number of colors of 
quarks. 
30.1.1 Triangle diagrams for massive fermions 
To begin, forget about symmetries and just consider the QED Lagrangian with a Yukawa 
coupling between a fermion 'IjJ and a pseudo scalar 1[': 
(30.1) 
You can think of 1[' as the neutral pion, '1/) as the proton, and the Yukawa coupling as A = ;:

To relate the result above to the physical pion decay rate, we need to know how the pion 
couples to charged fermions. These couplings can be extracted by recalling that the pions 
are Goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneously chiral symmetry of QCD. This 
interpretation of the pion was explained in Chapter 28, but we will review it here for clarity. 
Recall the QCD Lagrangian with two effectively massless flavors (mu , md « AQCD ):

which Wu and Wd transform as a doublet, but under a larger SU(2)L x SU(2)R symmetry 
under which the left-handed and right-handed quark doublets transform separately. Strong 
dynamics ofQCD induces condensates, (if;uWu ) ~ (ljjdWd) ~ A~CD' which spontaneously 
break SU(2)L x SU(2)R down to SU(2)isospin' Thus, in the low-energy theory, particles 
only form multiplets of SU (2 )isospin. For example, the proton and neutron form an isospin 
doublet \l! = (Wp, Wn). Under elements gL x gR of the chiral symmetry group, this doublet, 
which can be written as \l! = \l! L + \l! R, transforms as \l! L -+ gL \l! Land \l! R -+ gR \l! R. The 
nucleon mass term, mN\if\l! = mN\ifL\l!R + mNWR\l!L, is only invariant when gL = gR, 
that is, under SU(2)isospin. Since mN "-' 1 Ge V is large, in the theory with just the proton 
and neutron there is little evidence of the original chiral symmetry. 
A useful trick is to restore the full chiral symmetry by introducing a triplet of pions, na. 
These transform in the adjoint representation of isospin and nonlinearly under the broken 
generators of SU(2)L x SU(2)R. The transformation properties are efficiently encoded by 
embedding the pions in a field U = exp(2ina T a / F7r ) transforming as U -+ gLU gk. This 
lets us write down a Lagrangian invariant under SU(2)L x SU(2)R: 
£ = :; tr [(O!-,U) (o!-,U) t] + \if Li$\l! L + \if Ri$\l! R - mN (\hU\l! R + \if RUt\l! L) 
= ( - ~naDna + ... ) + W(i$ - mN)\l! + i 2mN na(w"'{5 T a\l! + ... ).

To connect to charge-eigenstate fields, recall that the charged pions are n± 
~ (n1 ± in2) and the neutral pion is nO = n 3. The proton and neutron form an isospin 
doublet. Using T3 = diag(~, -~), the interaction involving the nO and the proton is then 
i7!;-n O (if;p"'{5Wp) with WP the proton. In this way, the coupling of the neutral pion to a 
charged fermion (the proton) is determined. Thus, we can use Eq. (30.11) with A = i:

Although the nO --> --y--y rate was originally calculated (colTectly) through a proton 100 
[Steinberger, 1949], as we have done, it was not done using the Chiral Lagrangian All th P 
. 
at 
is in fact needed is that the neutral pion is one of the Goldstone bosons associated with 
the spontaneous breaking of SU(2h x SU(2)R --> SU(2). That is, one just needs to iden_ 
tify (nIJ~a(x)lna(p)) = ie'PX F1rp,., (as discussed in Chapter 28) and I take a = 3 for 
the neutral pion. In QCD, J~a = {j, a--y,.,--y5q with Til the i ospin generator. Although the 
pions are elementary particles in the Chiral Lagrangian but compo ile particles in QCD 
the cun-ent-algebra relation does not care: (nIJ~a(x)lna(p)) = ieipx F1rp,., holds in eithe; 
theory. Normally, we cannot calculate anything about pions in perturbative QCD. The 
decay nO --> --y--y is perhaps the unique exception to this rule: it does not get con-ections 
from QCD beyond I-loop. Although it is not at all obvious at this point, in the limit in 
which the pion is massless (so it is a Goldstone boson not a pesudo-Goldstone boson), the 
pion decay rate is exact at I-loop. Moreover, since the final result is independent of the 
mass of the particle going around the loop, we do not need to know the quark masses. In 
other words, we can take \It to be either the proton (which is part of an isospin doublet with 
the neutron) or the up and down quarks (which form an isospin doublet with each other). 
When \It is the (u, d) quark doublet instead of the (p+ , n) doublet, the factor of e2 in 
the amplitude is multiplied by a factor of Q;, where Qi is the charge of the quark. Using 
, 3 = diag (~, -
~) again, we see that the up quark gets the same isospin factor ~ as the 
proton, but the down quark gets -
~. In addition, we must sum over the number of colors 
N. Putting these factors together, the rate in Eq. (30.14) is multiplied by 
N 
3 
(30.15) 
Since the rate in Eq. (30.14) is already close to the known experimental value, we conclude 
that N = 3. Historically, this was one of first constraints on QCD [Adler, 1969], and it 
remains one of the easiest ways to measure the number of colors. l 
30.1.3 Currents and symmetries 
So far, we have just calculated the rate for a pseudo scalar to decay into two photons. We 
have not yet explained what this has to do with anomalous symmetries. In fact, the connec-
tion is not obvious. Indeed, the nO --> --y--y rate calculation has a tumultuous history: getting 
the rate right was one thing, understanding the calculation was another. In the 1940s, when 
nO --> --y--y was of particular interest, neither quantum field theory nor the profound impor-
tance of symmetries were well understood. Early attempts at this decay rate were producing 
non-gauge invariant amplitudes. A gauge-invariant result was finally achieved by Stein-
berger in 1949, using the recently proposed Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. However, 
Steinberger's result seemed to depend on the way in which the calculation was done. The 
1 We have shamelessly glossed over the fact that the 11"0 is massive and its mass is not less than the quark 
masses (at least the masses defined through the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation Eq. (28.37), m; == 
~ 
(mu + md)). A proper treatment of quark masses gives small corrections to our calculation. DetailS can 
be"found in [Adler, 1969], [Cheng and Li, 1985] or [Donoghue et aI., 1992].

------------------------------------------------....... 
puzzle was solved by Schwinger in 1951 who calculated a gauge-invmiant rate that was 
apparently free of ambiguities. (Schwinger's calculation, and his gauge-invariant proper-
time formalism, are described in Chapter 33.) The calculation then rested for 20 years, until 
quantum field theory had matured. It was not until 1969, through the work of Alder, Bell 
and Jackiw, that the subtleties in the 71'0 -+ " 
calculation, and the connection to anoma-
loUS symmetries, were finally understood. A discussion of the history of anomalies can be 
found in [Bastianelli and van Nieuwenhuizen, 2006, Section 5.4]. 
The relevant symmetries to be considered are present in the QED Lagrangian: 
I: = 1[J(i$ - e41 - m)1/J 
= 1[JL (i$ - e41)'ljJL + 1[JR(i$ - e41)'l/JR - m1[JL'l/JR - m1[JR'l/JL, 
(30.16) 
where the right- and left-handed fields are 'ljJR/L = 
~(1 ± ,5)'I/J as usual. In the limit 
Tn -+ 0, this Lagrangian is invariant under two independent global symmetries: 
(30.17) 
or equivalently, 
(30.18) 
The symmetries under which the left- and right-handed fields transform the same way are 
called vector symmetries, and the symmetries under which they transform with oppo-
site charge are called chiral symmetries. The Noether currents associated with these 
symmetries are 
(30.19) 
which are called the vector current and axial current respectively. The equations of 
motion imply 
(30.20) 
Thus, classically the vector symmetry is exactly conserved, which is important since it is 
the one that couples to QED, while the chiral symmetry is only conserved in the massless 
limit. 
To connect to the 71'0 -+ " 
calculation, we first recall that the result of the loop diagram, 
Eq. (30.10), was that M = A 4:;m E/1>l.'a{3 E~* E~* q'lqg. This loop can be interpreted as saying 
that the composite operator to which the pion couples, namely 1[J,5'I/J, has a non-zero value 
in the presence of a background electromagnetic field. More precisely,

30.2 Triangle diagrams with massless fermions 
It is not hard to see that the massless limit of the I-loop calculation we just did is not going 
to be smooth: the numerator trace in Eq. (30.7) vanishes as m ---+ 0, since it is proportional 
to m, and the final result in Eq. (30.10) blows up, since it is proportional to ~. Since 
what we are really interested in is the symmetry violation, it makes sense to recast the 
calculation as matrix elements of currents instead of matrix elements of the Goldstone 
bosons that these currents create from the vacuum. 
30.2.1 Current matrix elements 
We would like to see if the conservation laws op,P' = op,JP,5 = 0, which hold in the 
classical theory with massless fermions, also hold in the quantum theory. Recall from Sec-
tion 7.1 and Section 14.7 that the difference between classical and quantum theories 
is encoded in the Schwinger-Dyson equations. These equations describe how the clas-
sical equations of motion are modified for quantum fields inside correlation functions. 
Thus, we consider the correlation function (la5 (x) Jf.J, (y) JV (z)), which is closely related 
to the triangle diagrams computed in the previous section. We would like to know if 
a~", (la5(x) Jf.J,(y)JV(z)) = O. In this section, we calculate the relevant Feynman dia-
grams in perturbation theory. In Section 30.3, we use the path integral to rederive and 
reinterpret our perturbative result with the Schwinger-Dyson equations. 
In momentum space, we want to calculate 
iM~f.J,V(p , ql, q2) (21T)484(p - ql - q2)

(30.23) 
Here, the brackets indicate that the spin or indices inside are contracted. This looks like an 
S-matrix element without the LSZ projection factors putting the external states on-shell. 
We can evaluate it just as we would any other Green's function, but with the positions of 
some fields taken at the same point. Indeed, it is not hard to see that the leading diagramS

that contribute are the two in Eq. (30.2) without the external pion or photon lines, and 
without the coupling constants. Thus, at I-loop the correlation function is

(30.24) 
Rather than evaluating lvl~"'v and then contracting it variously with pC>, qi or q2' it is 
simpler to perform the contractions before evaluating the integrals. 
Contracting the axial current with its momentum pct gives 
(30.25) 
In this case, the integral is superficially linearly divergent as in the massive case. To 
simplify the integral, we can use { "15 , "I"'} = 0 and p"' = qi + q~ so that 
(30.26) 
Then, 
Each term in this expression has only one type of momentum in it (ql or q2), so by Lorentz 
invariance the integral of each term has to give either qi q'{ or q~ q2' both of which vanish 
when contracted with E"'vPcr. Thus, Pcx1Vl~"'v appears to vanish, in contradiction to our 
expectations. 
Before we make any rash conclusions, let us try to evaluate q~A1~ctv, which should be 
zero by the Ward identity of QED. We find 
(30.28) 
We can simplify these terms by writing qjl = U - (U - qjl) in the first term and qjl 
(U + q/l) - U in the second term, to remove terms in the denominator:

Now, if we were cavalier about the divergent integral, we would just shift k ---+ k + ql in 
the first integrand and k ---+ k + q2 in the second integrand to get something that identically 
vanishes. Unfortunately, this is incorrect. 
The mistake is to try to shift a linearly divergent integral. This is a very subtle point that 
confused many people for a long time. In fact, one ofthe reasons Schwinger set up his man-
ifestly gauge-invariant proper-time formalism (Chapter 33) was to resolve confusions in the 
literature about this type of integral. The most obvious way to make a divergent integral 
well-defined is to introduce a regulator. Unfortunately, none of our favorite regulators will 
work. For example, dimensional regularization has trouble with is since chiral fermions 
are a feature of four dimensions. One can use dimensional regularization, but it is very 
subtle. Pauli-Villars, which would introduce a heavy fermion, will not work either, since 
the fermion mass explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry we are trying to verify. Instead, we 
proceed by trying to make sense of the linearly divergent integrals directly. 
30.2.2 Linearly divergent integrals 
Consider the one-dimensional integral 
6(a) = I: 
dx[f(x + a) - f(x)] , 
(30.31) 
where the function f(x) goes to a constant at x = +00 and a different constant at x = -00. 
Then each term is linearly divergent, and we would like to know if the difference is finite 
or infinite. If we are allowed to shift x ---+ x - a on just the first term, then 6 (a) vanishes 
at the level of the integrand. On the other hand, if we Taylor expand around a = 0 we find 
6 (a) = I: 
dx [af'(x) + a; f"(x) + ... ] = a [f(oo) - f( - 00)], 
(30.32) 
where the higher-derivative terms do not contribute since f (±oo) = const. Thus, the dif-
ference between a linearly divergent integral and its shifted value has a linear dependence 
on the shift. 
In four dimensions, we can do the same thing. In this case, we will need to evaluate 
integrals such as 
(30.33)

Wick rotating, this is 
~a(al") = i J 
d4k~ (Fa[kE + a]- Fa [kE]) .

Taylor expanding the integrand around a = 0, as in the one-dimensional case, we get 
c,a(al") = i J ~::t [al" o~i (Fa [kE]) + ~al"av o~i O~E (Fa[kE]) + ... ] . (30.35) 
These derivative terms can then be integrated using Gauss's theorem. Since the integral is 
supposed to be linearly divergent, at large kE our function must scale as 
lim FQ;(kE) = Ak~:' 
kE-HXJ 
E 
(30.36) 
Therefore, everything but the term with one derivative vanishes too fast at infinity to 
contribute. To evaluate the one-derivative term, we write it as a surface integral:

(30.38) 
Finally, we use kakl" = ~k2ol"a and [24 = 271"2 to get 
(30.39) 
This is a general result: linearly divergent integrals that would vanish if we could shift are 
finite, with the result proportional to the necessary shift. 
30.2.3 Vector current conservation, continued 
We can now evaluate the integral in Eq. (30.30): 
1 MCl!J1V = _4iECl!vpa J d4k [(k - ql)P (k + q2)a _ (k - q2)P(k + ql)a]

Part of this integrand is quadratically divergent, but vanishes because Eavpa kP ka = O. 
Thus, we have a linear divergence. The first term has k shifted from the second by aa =

so that the vector cunent is conserved but the axial current is not. This second choice agrees 
with what we found in the massive case. When the electron has a mass, there is no longer 
an ambiguity - the chiral symmetry is already broken, so only the vector symmetry could 
possibly be conserved. 
30.2.4 Discussion 
We have found that the choice of momentum routing in the loops can affect the symmetry 
properties of the final result. You can think of this as a choice of regulator, although it 
is not really a regulator but rather a different type of ambiguity inherent in divergences 
of individual Feynman diagrams. If one insist on pre erving gauge invariance, then for

various I'-matrices so that there is only one PL left. Then we expand PL =

into two terms. The term without 1'5 is just Al'{:f.LV, corresponding to the 3-point function 
with all vector currents (J'" Jf.L J 1/ ). The other has a single 1'5, which gives the quantity

words, either o", (J'tJiJ'L) -=I- 0 or of.L (J'tJi J'L) -=I- O. Thus, the Ward identity cannot be 
satisfied. The same conclusion obviously holds for a theory with only a single right-handed 
fermion. In either case, the Ward identity must be violated and 
QED with a single Weyl fermion is inconsistent. 
What if we had left- and a right-handed fermions with different charges Q Land Q R?

In this case, the gauge boson Af.L couples to

In this case, there is a contribution to (J;:'ixJ::'j x J~jx ) with either fermion in the loop.

Therefore, the only way a theory with a gauge boson that couples to a single left-handed 
and a single right-handed fermion can be consistent is if QL = QR, as in QED.

This leaves us with an obvious follow-up question: Are the weak interactions ano", 
'<la_ 
lous? Since the 8U(2)weak gauge group of the Standard Model only couples to left-hande 
fields, it seems very dangerous. To answer this question, we need the generalization of th d 
above results to non-Abelian CUlTents. But first we repeat the chiral anomaly calcUlatio~ 
using a different technique. 
30.3 Chiral anomaly from the integral measure 
In the previous section, we calculated the chiral anomaly through Feynman diagrams. In 
the massless case, this calculation was very subtle and involved a careful choice of momen_ 
tum in a loop integral. A more direct connection between the anomaly and the violation 
of a symmetry uses the path integral. The intuitive idea, due to Kazuo Fujikawa, is that 
anomalies arise when there are symmetries of the action that are not symmetries of the 
functional measure in the path integral. 
To begin, we quickly review the path-integral proof of cunent conservation in the 
quantum theory from Section 14.5. We start with 
(O(Xl",.,Xn)) = Z~Ol J D7~D'Ij;exp[iJ d4Xi7/JQJ'lj;]O(Xl,""Xn), 
(30.54) 
where O(Xl" .. , xn) is some gauge-invariant operator. For example, you can think of 
o = P' (y)]V (z) . This action is invariant under the global symmetries 'Ij; --t eiD:'Ij; 
and 'Ij; -t e'{J'Y6'I/J. To derive ctment conservation for the vector symmetry, we redefine

The only part of the above derivation that changes when we consider an axial rotation 
'Ij; --t ei (3(x h 5 'Ij; is that the path integral measure is no longer invariant. 
To see how the measure changes, consider a general linear transformation 'Ij;(x) -> 
6.(x)'Ij;(x) and 7/J(x) --t 6.t(x)'Ij;(x) which generates a Jacobian factor: 
D7/J D'Ij; --t 1..11 - 2 D7/J D'Ij;. 
(30.57) 
The Jacobian ..1 = det 6. appears to a negative power because the transformed variables 
are ferrnionic (see Section 14.6). To make sense out of..1 we write 
..1 = det 6. = exp tr In 6.,

where the trace sums over the eigenvalues of In 1:1. For example, consider a non-chiral 
transformation l:1(x) = ei a(x). In this case, we can write tr In 1:1 = i J d4x a(x) and

Thus, 1.112 = 1 and the measure is invariant. For a chiral transformation, 1:1 (x ) = ei (3(xh

To find a sensible answer for this Jacobian, one approach is to work in QED. Thus, we 
consider the QED path integral

The action is still invariant under the global symmetries 1/; ~ eia1/; and 1/; ~ ei {3'5'l/J with 
AI-' unchanged. Under the local axial transformation, AI-' is invariant, so its transformation 
does not contribute to the Jacobian. 
To regulate the divergence, it is helpful first to introduce a one-particle Hilbert space

.1 = exp(i J 
d4XT'r[(XI,B(i:h5Ix)l) ,

with 1'r a Dirac trace.2 Now, we regulate the divergence in a gauge-invariant manner by

introducing an exponential regulator of the form exp(-:vI: jA2), where:vl: = p - e.q!(i:),

want to use the mathematical tricks we learned in quantum mechanics to write the function (3(x) in a suggestive 
form. There is in fact a beautiful interpretation of one-particle Hilbert spaces like this in quantum field theory, 
to which much of Chapter 33 is devoted.

We often abbreviate this with 
(30.71) 
which agrees with Eq. (30.22). This equation confirms the interpretation of the chiral 
anomaly as due to non-invariance of the path integral measure. 
Since this derivation did not appear to use perturbation theory, it seems to imply that the 
anomaly equation. Eq. (30.71), is exact. Indeed, the conclusion is correct: 
The chiral anomaly is I-loop exact. 
But the logic is flawed. In fact, the path integral transformation amounts to a I-loop com-
putation, as can be seen from Eq. (30.67) or by restoring factors of It (the correspondence 
between functional determinants and loops will be explored in Chapters 33 and 34). ThuS, 

30.4 Gauge anomalies in the Standard MOdel 
--------------------~~-------------------------------------
a more accurate statement is because the anomaly is exact at I-loop, the measure trans-
formation gives the correct answer. The I-loop exactness of the chiral anomaly was first 
proposed by Adler and Bell using diagrammatic arguments. Its most satisfying proof uses 
topological arguments (see for example [Nakahara, 2003] or [Weinberg, 1996] for details). 
30.4 Gauge anomalies in the Standard Model 
In this section, we will check that the currents associated with the SU(3)QCD x SU(2)weak x 
U(l)y gauge symmetries of the Standard Model are non-anomalous. If we write these three 
currents as JJCD , J:eak and J;: , then we have to show that A/-' (Jt J~ J~) = 0 for j , k, l any 
of the forces. This is easiest to do by reading charges or anomaly coefficients from the 
triangle diagrams. 
When all the three currents involved are associated with U(l)y, we call the puta-
tive anomaly the U(l)~ anomaly. It is easy to check that this vanishes. As we saw in 
Eq. (30.53), left-handed Weyl fermions and right-handed Weyl fermions contribute to the 
anomaly with opposite signs. Therefore, we have 
o/-,JI; = (LY? - L Y/) 3';:2 E/-,va(3 B/-,vBa (3, 
left 
right 
(30.72) 
where B/-,v is the field strength for U(l)y. The vanishing of the U(l)~ anomaly requires 
(30.73) 
Here, YL , Ye , Yv , YQ , Yu and Yd are the hypercharges for the left-handed leptons, the light-
handed electrons (or muon or tauon), the light-handed neutrinos (assuming they exist), 
the left-handed quarks, the light-handed up-type quarks and the right-handed down-type 
quarks, respectively. As derived in Chapter 29, these charges are (see Table 29.1) 
1

2 
1 
YL = -2' Ye = -1, 
Yv = 0, 
YQ = 6' 
Yu = 3' 
Yd = -3' 
(30.74) 
Plugging in to Eq. (30.73), we find that the anomaly in fact vanishes. Note that the anomaly 
would vanish for any number of generations, but that it does not vanish for the quarks or 
leptons alone. 
By the way, one can also trivially check that the U(1)~M anomaly vanishes in QED. In 
QED, all the left- and right-handed charged particles are Dirac, and hence have the same 
charges (QED is non-chiral). Thus, in QED, i:left Q1 = i:right Q1. That the U(l)~M 
anomaly vanishes also follows from the vanishing of anomalies in the electroweak theory, 
which we have nearly shown. 
For non-Abelian gauge theories, the currents associated with the gauge fields are of the 
form

The contribution proportional to the r bc gives the difference between the two loops. This 
clifference is UV divergent. However, since it is proportional to r bc, it can be removed 
through renormalization wil'hoUl violating gauge invariance. Indeed, it contributes to the 
renormalization of the f"bc A~A~aI.lA~ vertex in the Yang- Mills Lagrangian.

fundamental representation. Thus, A(fund) = 1. 
The contribution proportional to the anomaly constant dabc sum the two triangle dia-
grams. It is therefore proportional to the result from summing the diagrams in the U(1) 
case. We thus find

the normalization using the U(l)~ anomaly. For a U(l) TO = 1, dubc = <1 and so 
Eq. (30.80) reduces to Eq. (30.72). Note that Eq. (30. 0) can vani h either if the anomaly 
coefficients cancel in the sum, or if dabc = O. 
Now we would like check whether anomalies cancel in the Standard Model. Fo)' 8U(2), 
we can use {Ta , Tb} = ~ Jab]. Then dabc = 6bctl'{ rU} = O. Thu , there can never be

theory, but since QeD is non-chiral, there are no 8'U(3)~co anomalie in (he Standard 
Model. Next, consider mixed anomalies. An

same way, any anomaly with exactly one factor of SU(2) or SU(3) vanishes. The only 
possible anomalies are therefore SU(3)2U(1) and SU(2)2U(1). 
The SU(3)~CD U(1) anomaly gets contributions only from quarks. Using tr{TaTb} = 
loab, which holds for any SU(N), we find that this anomaly is proportional to

Plugging in the values in Eq. (30.74), this vanishes. The SU(2)2U(1) anomaly only gets

For this anomaly to cancel, left-handed leptons must have -3 times the hypercharge ofleft-
handed quarks, as they do. Thus, all possible anomalies associated with the SU(3)QCD x 
SU(2)weak x U(l)y of the Standard Model exactly vanish. 
There is one more type of gauge boson in the Standard Model whose anomalies must 
cancel: the graviton. The calculation of the anomaly with one gauge boson and two external 
gravitons produces 
(30.83) 
where R!-'vc>/3 is the Riemann tensor. Since the SU(N) generators are traceless, there 
are no grav2SU(2) or grav2SU(3) anomalies. The only thing we have to worry about is 
grav2U(1)y. Since all fermions couple to gravity, we must have 
0= 2:Yt - 2: Yr = (2YL - Ye - Yv) + 3(2YQ - Yu - Yd).

hypercharges are uniquely determined. The second solution, Eq. (30.86), is not realiZed in 
nature. 
Notice that any solution of Eq. (30.85) or Eq. (30.86) has YL + 3YQ = 0 exactly. 
As a consequence, the electron must have exactly the same electric charge as the proton. 
Without anomaly considerations, one might have imagined that the electron could have had 
say 3.0001 times the quark charge, giving a small residual charge to the atom. Anomaly 
cancellation says this cannot be true. Charge is quantized! 
Another question we can ask is: Can there be another U (1) force acting on the Standard 
Model particles that we do not know about? Let us call this force U(I)~ and the charges 
under this new group Y/. For anomalies to cancel, all the conditions in Table 30.1 must 
hold with Yi --> Y;.'. In addition, U(I)~ U(I)y, and U(1)y U(I)~, anomalies must cancel. 
As you can easily check, the only possibility is that Y/ satisfy Eq. (30.85) with Yi --> Y;'. 
Taking a = 1 and b = 0 sets y;" equal to the Standard Model hypercharges. The orthogonal 
possibility is a = 0, b = 1, which gives 
YI = Y: = Y~ = -1, 
(30.87) 
These charges are -1 for the leptons and 1 for quarks, or equivalently + 1 for baryons. We 
call this new group U(I)B-L and will discuss it more in the next section. 
30.5 Global anomalies in the Standard Model 
We have argued that anomalies must vanish for symmetries associated with gauge fields. If 
this were not true, the Ward identity would be violated and we could no longer guarantee 
that only the two physical polalizations of a massless spin-l particle would propagate. On 
the other hand, if the symmetry is a global symmetry not associated with a gauge field, it 
can be anomalous. For example, the 1r0 --> TY decay is due to an anomalous axial cun'ent 
as we discussed in Section 30.1. If G is a global symmetry, then G3 anomalies have no 
physical effect. The simplest way to see this is that, for a global symmetry, there is no 
associated EJ1-l/cx(3 FJ1-I/FJ1-1/ term for a current to diverge to. Thus, the global anomalies of 
interest are the G H2 anomalies, where H is one of the Standard Model gauge groupS.

30.5.1 Baryogenesis 
------------------------------------------------------------
An important example of a global symmetry of the Standard Model Lagrangian is baryon 
IlUmber, for which all quarks have B = ~ and leptons have B = O. That is u ~ 
·1 
eifiau, d ~ e"sad, e ~ e, Ve ~ Ve , etc. Another example is lepton number, for which 
quarks have L = 0 and leptons have L = 1. Substituting these quantum numbers into the 
anomaly constraints in Table 30.1 we see that all of the mixed anomalies vanish except for 
SU(2)2U(I)B and SU(2)2U(lk For these,

(30.88) 
where W:v is the SU(2) field strength and ng is the number of generations (ng = 3 in the 
Standard Model). So Band L are anomalous. 
On the other hand, this equation implies that the global symmetry B - L, where quarks 
have B - L = 
~ and leptons have B - L = -1, is non-anomalous (as we saw in 
Eq. (30.87)). Thus, while it is not possible to have a gauge boson associated with B or 
L, it is possible to have one associated with B - L. In fact, such gauge bosons are common 
in grand unified theories. If such a gauge boson exists, it would mediate processes that vio-
late B- and L-number conservation but preserve B - L, such as proton decay: p+ ~ 7r°e+. 
There are very strong bounds on the proton lifetime (T > 1033 years), so this hypothetical 
B - L gauge boson should be very heavy (~10
16 GeV). 
Returning to the Standard Model, it is natural to ask what physical effect the anomaly 
aILJ!! ;Ie 0 can have. Recall from Eq. (29.105) that the anomaly term is a total deriva-
tive, cILvcxf3W:v vV~f3 = 0ILKIL, so it cannot contribute at any order in perturbation theory 
(any Feynman diagram with this vertex would have a factor of L: PIL = 0). However, it 
could possibly contribute to the path integral through field configurations that are locally 
gauge equivalent to 0, but are topologically stable. A class of such configurations is the 
sphalerons, which violate Band L but preserve B - L. Sphalerons can mediate baryon 
number violation into leptons. 
Sphalerons are static configurations of the SU(2) gauge fields that can be locally 
gauged away. For these configurations, J d4x cILvcxf3W:v W~f3 rv 3 (167r2) 
;Ie O. The 
results of sphaleron calculations imply that the rate per unit volume for the transfer 
from baryon number to lepton number violation at zero temperature should be roughly 
r IV rv mw exp ( - ~) rv mw 10- 180 , which is exceedingly tiny. At temperatures of 
order mw, the rate can actually be much higher. 
One of the reasons baryon number violation is interesting is because of the preponder-
ance of matter over antimatter in the universe. In order to establish such an asymmetry, 
Andrei Sakharov showed in 1967 that three conditions must be met [Sakharov, 1967]: 
Sakllarov cond~tions to produce a matter-antimatter asymmetry 
: . f3~x ~30.-l . 
1. Baryon number must be violated. 
2. C and CP must be violated. 
3. There must have been some departure from thermal equilibrium. 

636 
Anomalies 
If any of these do not hold, the matter-antimatter a ymmetry would have been washed 
by thermal fluctuations. For example, by 
PI'invariance, the rare for allY conversionO~1 
matter into antimatter must be the same as th rate for c nver ion of antimatter into matte f 
hence the need for non-equilibrium dynamiC!. Inlriguingly aU of the e conditions are .f 
fact satisfied in the Standard Model: baryon number is violated by the anomaly, Cp ~I; 
violated because there are tJu'ee generations and hence a phase in the CKM matrix, and as 
the universe cool. it is out of equilibrium. In particular, as it cools through the electroweak 
pha e transition a malter-antimatter asymmetry can be produced. Unfortunately, to explain 
the matter-antimatter asymmetry quantitatively, we need more baryon number violation 
more CP violation, and a phase transition that is not as smooth as in the Standard MOdel 
(it should be strongly first order). That baryogenesis cannot be explained in the Standard 
Model remains an important motivation for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. 
30.5.2 The U(l) and strong CP problems 
-
Another important application of global anomalies is to the strong CP problem. This Was 
discussed in Section 29.5. There, we started from the Standard Model with Yukawa Cou-
plings to the Higgs doublet, spontaneously broke electroweak symmetry, then performed 
chiral rotations on the left-handed and right-handed quarks to move all CP violation into 
the CKM matrix. The CKM matrix could be taken real up to a single phase, known as the 
weak CP phase. However, in doing the chiral rotations, since the measure is not invariant, 
we generate a term

where Fa i the QCD field trength (one also generates c/-,va{3 P,~"F'~{J term for the weak

rotation of jll lthe right-handed field ). There wa therefore an addjtional cbiral-r tation-
invariant pha e called the trong CP phase, given by e = eQCD + arg det(YdYu )' We 
arglled that the neutron pick up an electric dipole moment proportional to e, and CUlTent 
experimental bound require B < 10- 12 . The strong CP problem is: Why is this phase so 
smaH? Po sible solutions were discussed in Chapter 29. 
Another example of a global anomaly is the chiral symmetry of QCD. Consider QeD 
in the limit that the three lightest quark flavors (up, down and strange) can be treated as 
massless. Then the Lagrangian is just 
L = - ~ (F:v) 2 + iij~J1Jq~ + iij~J1Jq~ , 
(30.90) 
where Land R refer to the left- and right-handed quarks. This Lagrangian ha a global 
U(3)L x U(3)R symmetry. The QCD vacuum has (ii/An) ~ V 3 ~ A~co f:. 0 spon-

In reality, quarks do have masses, and so the pseudoscalar mesons (the Goldstone bosons) 
pick up mass (becoming pseudo-Goldstone bosons) according to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-
Renner relation, Eq. (28.37): m;F; ::::0 V 3m q . 
Now, consider neutral mesons. Experimentally, the lightest two neutral mesons are the 
?fo (135 MeV) and the 7) (549 MeV). After that, the next lightest has mass 957 MeV, which 
we would like to identify with the 7)'. Unfortunately, if you work out the group theory 
factors for the Goldstone masses, you find that this is impossible. The mass of the diagonal 
Goldstone boson, the 7)', must satisfy m'r)l < V3m7fo [Weinberg, 1975]. Why the 7)' is 
so heavy is known as the U(I) problem. It is called that because the Goldstone boson 
corresponding to the axial diagonal U (1) is apparently missing. 
The solution to the U(I) problem should now be apparent: the symmetry of the QeD 
Lagrangian is not in fact U(3)L x U(3)R = U(lh X U(I)R x SU(3h X SU(3)R because 
the U(l)A under which qL ---> eieqL and qR ---> e-ieqR is anomalous. Under this U(l)A all 
quarks have charge 1, so the anomaly corresponds to SU(3)~cDU(I)A triangle diagrams. 
Since the symmetry is anomalous, it is not a symmetry. If there is no symmetry, it cannot 
be spontaneously broken and there can be no Goldstone boson. Note that the SU(3)L and 
SU(3)R do not have an SU(3);olor x SU(3)L anomaly, since the SU(3) generators are 
traceless. 
The U(l) problem and the strong CP problem are actually closely related. The same 
chiral rotations that move the CP phase between the quark mass matrix and BQCD 
are those corresponding to the anomalous U(l)A. In both cases, the anomaly is from 
SU(3)~cDU(1)A. Under the U(l)A rotation, the measure changes and the Lagrangian 
shifts to

Thus, the physics of the anomaly for both the strong CP and U(I) problems must come 
from topologically non-trivial gauge configurations. One might have tried to define the 
path integral excluding these configurations to solve the strong C P problem. But then 
the U(l) problem would not be solved. Thus, the heavy 7)' tells us that non-perturbative 
configurations must be important. 
It is challenging to calculate the 7)' mass in QeD, since non-perturbative methods are 
needed. One such method is the lattice, which has in fact been able to calculate the 7)' mass 
purely within QeD to within around 10%. Analytically, one can approach the problem by 
Summing over topological configurations, in this case instantons, but the result is only an 
order of magnitude estimate. Another approach is the large N limit of QeD, which relates 
the 7)' mass to the topological susceptibility, defined by

Now let us gauge the whole symmetry group G by introducing gauge bosons, but take 
their gauge couplings arbitrarily small so that the gauge bosons d not affect the phy ic . 
The anomalies, such as an SU(3)i anomaly, will have physical effect . H wever, weean 
cancel these anomalies by introducing a bunch of left- or right-handed spectator fermion. 
It is not hard to choose their quantum numbers so that all the anomalies cancel, and in fact 
there are many solutions. Since the gauge couplings are infinitesimal, these fermions wilJ 
also not affect the physics. 
Now consider the low-energy theory where the quarks are confined. Then the spectrum 
compri 'e not quark but mesons and baryons which are all color singlets. We have not 
PI' ven confinement, but it i apparenUy true, so let us just assume it happens. Indeed it is 
helpful at thi.s point to have in. the back of your mind a more general theory with N colors 
and nJ flavor , where we do not know if confinement happens or not. In the general case, 
me on are till fiq pair .• but baryon are bound states of N quarks or N antiquarks, which 
are fermions for N odd. 
Since anomalies are determined by massle 
particle , they are long-distance effect . 
Thus, they cannot change by a phase transition that happen at a fin ite scale such a AQCD. 
This implies that, since the theory above the pha e tran ition wa anomaly free, the theory 
below the transition must also be anomaly free. Another way to ee thi i thaL a gauge 
anomaly would imply an inconsistency of the gauge theory such as unitarity violation. 
Such a drastic change from a consistent field theory to an in on i tent one cannot happen 
just due to a phase transition. But below the fntn ition the rna sie 
quark are no longer 
around to cancel the anomalies of the spectaLor . 0 how can this happen? There must 
be other massless particles in the spectrum. There are two possibilities: a symmetry can 
be spontaneously broken, in which case there will be massless Goldstone bosons, or else 
there might be massless baryons.

and was anomalous to begin with, even without our fictitious gauge bosons. Before symme-
try breaking, the theory was anomaly free. But after symmetry breaking, when the quarks 
are confined, it seems there is a U(l)tEDU(l)7ro anomaly. This must somehow be com-
pensated for by the only relevant massless particle, the 7r0 . To see how, recall that the pion 
transforms under the broken symmetry as a shift 7r0 --+ 7r0 + () (this shift is what for-
bids a mass term for the pion, among other things). Therefore, we can compensate for the 
anomaly that rotates the coefficient of E/1va.(3 F/1vFa.(3 by adding a term

to the Chiral Lagrangian. In fact, this is the unique term whose chiral rotation 7r0 --+ 7r0 + () 
can exactly compensate the chiral rotation of the spectators. The factor of N comes from 
the N spectators that compensate for the N colors of quarks in the high-energy theory. It is 
in this way that the 7r0 --+ 'Y'Y rate is completely fixed by the anomaly and can be computed 
in perturbation theory, despite the fact that pions are composite objects. In fact, this was 
one of the early ways in which the number of colors N was cleanly measured. 
Now let us suppose instead that SU(3)L x SU(3)R were not spontaneously broken. Then 
there would be no Goldstone bosons whose transformations could compensate the anomaly 
of the spectator. Consider the SU(3)1 anomalies. These cancel if and only if the sum of the 
anomaly coefficients 2:iA(Ri) = 0, where the sum is over all left-handed fermions in the 
theory. In QCD the quarks transform in the fundamental representation with A(fund) = l. 
Including the three colors, the anomaly coefficient in QCD is then 3, thus the spectators 
contribute - 3, by construction. 
For the anomalies to be the same in the confined phase, color singlet fermions con-
structed out of quarks must be able to provide 2:iA(Ri) = 3 to cancel the spectators. 
Since QCD has N = 3, color singlet fermions must be baryons comprising three quarks. 
To see what the contributions of the baryons could be, we have to decompose the tensor 
product of three fundamental representations of SU(3)L into irreducible representations of 
SU(3)L. The decomposition is [Georgi, 1982] 
3 ® 3 ® 3 = (6 EB 3) ® 3 = (6 ® 3) EB (3 ® 3) = 10 EB 8 EB 8 EB 1. 
(30.95) 
These are the decuplet, two octets and one singlet. (These are the same decuplet and octet 
that were shown in Section 28.2.3 in the context of Gell-Mann's eightfold way.) Of these, 
the 8 and 1 are real representations so they give A(Ri) = O. To find A(ID) we use the iden-
tities A(Rl EB Rz) = A(Rd + A(R2 ) and A(Rl ® R2 ) = A(Rl) d(Rz) + d(Rd A(Rz), 
which you proved in Problem 25.4. First, we find 
A(6) = A(3 ® 3) - A(3) = 3A(3) + 3A(3) - A(3) = 7. 
(30.96) 
Then we find 
A(ID) = A(6 ® 3) - A(8) = 3A(6) + 6A(3) - A(8) = 27. 
(30.97) 
Ifthere are n decuplets of baryons, they will contribute 27n, which cannot possibly cancel 
the -3 from the spectators (we would need n = ~ decuplets!). We conclude that the 
chiral symmetry SU(3)L x SU(3)R of QCD must be spontaneously broken. Note that this

Yet, if the theories agree at the fixed point, the spectators one adds to cancel anomalies at

are identical in the two theories, despite their radically different particle content, is strong 
evidence for the conjectured duality. See [Terning, 2006] for a more in-depth discussion. 
Anomaly matching is one the few tools we have for making concrete statements about 
non-perturbative theories.

Precision tests of the 
Standard Model 
I 
We now have discussed the complete Standard Model of particle physics. The model is 
based on the gauge group SU(3)QCD x SU(2)weak x U(lhypercharge, which is spontaneously 
broken down to SU(3)QCD x U(l)EM at a scale v = 247 GeY. Assuming Dirac neu-
trino masses, the Standard Model has 27 parameters: three coupling constants g, g' and 
g8; six quark, three charged lepton, and three neutrino masses; three mixing angles and 
one phase among quarks; three mixing angles and one phase among leptons; the Higgs 
mass mh and vev v; the QCD vacuum angle 1J; and the cosmological constant A. While 
27 parameters might seem like a lot, there are an infinite number of measurements that 
could conceivably be done. Since the Standard Model is renormalizable, the result of any 
of these infinite number of measurements can, in principle, be expressed as a function of 
these 27 parameters. Thus, the Standard Model is an overconstrained system - we can test 
it by making enough measurements with enough precision. In this chapter, we discuss two 
ways in which quantum field theory at loop level is required to connect measurements to 
the parameters of the Standard Model. 
First we will discuss constraints on the gauge sector of the electroweak theory. At tree-
level, many observables depend only on the three parameters g, g' and v (or equivalently 
(le, sin2ew and the Fermi constant GF). The dominant radiative cOlTections to many of 
these observables are from virtual top-quark- and Higgs-boson-Ioop contributions to the 
HI -boson, Z -boson and photon propagators. Corrections to the gauge boson propagators 
are called oblique corrections. Oblique cOlTections provided important indirect informa-
tion about the mass of the top quark and Higgs boson before these particles were seen 
directly, and they continue to provide important constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model 
physics. Electroweak precision constraints are often expressed in terms of the S, T, U and 
p parameters, which will be defined and discussed in Section 31.2. 
Another area where loops play an important role in connecting observables to parameters 
of the Standard Model is in the arena of flavor physics. Recall from Chapter 29 that the 
CKM matrix is unitary in the Standard Model. If enough CKM elements are measured, this 
unitarity can be directly tested. The sensitivity of such tests to beyond-the-Standard-Model 
physics is only limited by the level of precision with which theory and experiment can be 
compared. In Section 31.3, we discuss important loop cOlTections from QCD. In palticular, 
We will show how virtual gluons modify the relation between CKM elements extracted at 
low energy (such as Vcb, which can be measured from B+ ~ fj07r+ decays) and CKM 
elements at the weak scale. The calculation we perform involves renormalization group 
evolution with operator mixing, a beautiful subject in its own right.

Precision tests of the Standard Model 
31.1 Electroweak precision tests 
~~~~~~~~~'u."""""""""""""ID~~~~~~"""""""""~". 
In this section we discuss precision electroweak physics, which is concerned (mainl 
with observables constructed out of leptons and electroweak gauge bosons. We disc y) 
uSs 
quark-based observables in Section 31.3 and in Chapters 32, 35 and 36. 
There are a few quantities that are basically only sensitive to electroweak physics and 
have been measured extremely well. We will focus on five of them: 
1. The electron magnetic dipole moment ~ge = 1.00115965218073 ± 2.8 x 10-13. 
2. The lifetime of the muon: 71-' = (2.1969811 ± 0.0000022) x 10-68. In GeV, the 
decay rate is 7;;1 = r (p,- -t lJl-'e- ve) = 2.99598 x 10- 19 GeV. 
3. The Z-boson pole mass: mZ,poJe = 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV 
4. The W-boson pole mass: mW,pole = 80.385 ± 0.015 GeV 
5. The polarization asymmetry in Z-boson production: 
(JL -

(31.1) 
(JL + (JR 
(J (eLeL -t Z + (J eReR -t Z 
This asymmetry, which can be measured using polarized electron beams, would vanish in 
a non-chu"al theory. Another important observable is the decay rate of the Z boson into 
electrons r (Z -t e+c), which you can explore in Problem 31.2. 
In the Standard Model, at leading order in perturbation theory, each one of these five 
observables depends only on three electroweak parameters: the strength of the QED 
coupling e (or equivalently the fine-structure constant Q e == ::), the Higgs vev v (or 
equivalently the Fermi constant G F == Jv 2 ) and the weak mixing angle 8 = sin Ow'

The polarization asymmetry Ae is non-zero because the Z boson has different couplings

(31.4) 
we find that

31.1 Electroweak precision tests 
-
Now we would like to know whether all the measured values for these observables are 
consistent with the Standard Model. 
To begin, we have to come up with a clean definition of the three parameters e, G F 
and sin2ew based on experiments. That is, we need to define renormalization conditions 
for them. We will denote the values of these couplings extracted from the first three 
measurements above with a circumflex, as G F, e and 82 . We also define 
mz == mZ,polc' 
(31.6) 
Any other quantity related to these three by tree-level algebraic relations will also be 
denoted with a circumflex. For example, v = J -./26 F or 
, 
ev 
mH! = 28' 
(31.7) 
This mw is not equal to mW,pole' We compute the difference in this chapter. 
Since ge is known extremely well, we use it to define e. We worked out that ge - 2 = 
~ at I-loop in Chapter 17, but actually the calculation is known to very high orders, 
1f 
competing with the experimental precision. This high-order calculation and the precise ge 
measurement give 
De(O) = (137.035999074 ± 0.000000044) - 1 , 
(31.8) 
with Dc = !:. The 0 argument of De refers to this being a long-distance (p2 ~ 0) measure-
ment. That is, this value of the fine-structure constant corresponds to the on-shell coupling 
e defined through the 3-point function in Section 19.3. For precision electroweak physics, it 
is more useful to work with Qe (mz) which is [Particle Data Group (Beringer et al.), 2012J 
ae (mz) - l = 127.944 ± 0.014. 
(31.9) 
The running of Cl:e has been discussed elsewhere (Chapters 16 and 23), thus we simply take 
this value as input. 
By the way, we will always evaluate running couplings and running masses with J-L set 
equal to an MS mass. Technically, De(mz) and De(mZ) differ by cOITections that begin 
at 2-100p and beyond, so which scale we choose is beyond the order we are working in 
this chapter. However, since the RGEs are calculated in the lVIS scheme, it makes sense to 
choose J-L to be an ]\iIS mass. An example where the choice of scale is important is for the 
top mass, as discussed around Eq. (31.62) below. 
Next, since Tp is extremely well measured, we use it to define G 
F = Ail 2 ' Using 
the measured values ml-' = 105.6583715 MeV and me = 0.510998910 MeV in our 
tree-level decay formula we get 
(31.1 0) 
which gives v = J V'26
F = 246.48 GeY. 
Finally, for sin2ew , there are many reasonable definitions. For example, one could define 
sin2ew == 1 - ~ , or one could define it from Ae· In the MS scheme, one could define 
m z 
it from the renormalized coupling constants as tan ew == ~. For precision tests, a logical 
643

choice is to base it on the next-best-measured quantity in tlns list, mz = mZ,pole. We call 
this value 8. It satisfies the relation

Plugging in the numbers (and using that 82 ~ 1 - ~

82 = 0.234289.

These are well outside the experimental bounds - by nearly 40 standard deviations in the 
mw case! This does not mean we have a contradiction within the Standard Model. We 
cannot make such a conclusion until we include loop corrections and carefully renormalize. 
31.1.1 Oblique corrections 
In order to test the electroweak sector, we will proceed in four steps: 
1. Express our fiducial quantities ae , G F and mz in terms of M8 Lagrangian parameters 
e, mz and sin2ew ' 
2. Solve for the Lagrangian parameters in terms of the fiducial quantities. 
3. Express any other quantity we want to compute (mw,pole and Ae) in terms of Lagrangian 
parameters. 
4. Substitute in the measured quantities to get our predictions. 
To be clear, in the notation we use for this chapter e and m z mean the M8 renormalized 
electric charge and Z -boson M8 mass, which are in general different from the charge e and 
pole mass mz in the on-shell scheme. Quantities with circumflexes (such as s, C and mw) 
are related to the fiducial quantities ae (mz), mz and G 
F by tree-level relations. 
There are many loops that can contribute to radiative corrections of the observables listed 
above. However, since the observables are given at tree-level by gauge boson exchange, the 
largest contributions will come from loops affecting the gauge boson propagators. For his-
torical reasons, these are called oblique corrections. An advantage of these observables 
is that, since the Standard Model would have the same sllucture with any number of gen-
erations, the oblique corrections from each generation will be gauge invariant and finite. 
We will therefore focus on the largest corrections, which come from loops of the third 
generation quarks (t, b) and from the Higgs boson.

and similarly for other 2-point functions. 
The Z -boson propagator gets radiative corrections from loops, which correct both the 
gJ1.V and pJ1.pV terms. By Lorentz invariance, we must find 
(31.17) 
However, since aU the observables in which we are interested have the gauge bosons cou-
pling to essentially massless fermions (which provide conserved cunents), the pJ1.pV terms 
will not contribute. Thus, we can simply write that the conections will give

The real part of IIzz is taken in Eq. (31.20) because the Z boson is unstable. I Note that 
if we use IIzz to I-loop order, it does not matter which m1 is used in the argument of 
IIzz - the difference is higher order. This is our first equation relating an observable (mz) 
to an MS quantity (mz). 
I Recall from Section 24.1.4 that 2-point functions for unstable particles have imaginary parts proportional to 
their decay widths. Since the width of the Z boson (l z = 2,5 GeV) is much less than its mass (mz = 91.2 
GeV), the relation Im [IIzzl = -mz,pOlc1Z applies. For p2 near m~, the 2-point function then becomes

For the remainder of this chapter, we will not write Re [1 explicitly. We will simply evaluate 
the real part of the various self-energy functions at the end of the calculation. 
For corrections to the photon propagator, recall that the photon is massless to all orders 
in perturbation theory, since its mass is forbidden by gauge invariance. Thus we have

Now, let us relate the renormalized electric charge e (the MS parameter in the 
Lagrangian) to the value e2 (mz ) = 47rae (mz) in Eq. (31.9) (which comes from a physical 
measurement). One way to define e2 (Q) is as the value of the effective charge relevant for

F on the left-hand side is the measured value, extracted from the muon lifetime 
in Eq. (31.1 0), while all the quantities on the right-hand side are MS quantities. 
The final observable, the Z-boson production asymmetry Ae, is determined by how the 
Z boson couples to electrons. In the 1\118 Lagrangian the Z and photon couplings are 
where c = Vf=S2. Here, s = sin ()w is the renormalized MS value for the sine of the

weak mixing angle. At tree-level, this Lagrangian gives Ae = (~ -8 2/ -S , as in Eq. (31.5).

At I-loop, there is a contribution to Z-boson production from IIzz vacuum polarization 
graphs and from vacuum polarization graphs that mix the Z boson with the photon: 
and 
(31.29) 
The first graph tells us that we should use the corrected propagator with a pole at mZ,pole 
rather than at m z. Since we evaluate these graphs with momentum p2 = m ~ going through 
the boson lines, we can account for the IIzz correction at I-loop by simply replacing mz 
by mz in the tree-level result. Since the tree-level result for Ae has no mz dependence, 
the effect of IIzz is higher order. 
The second graph gives a factor of II'~~P2) with p2 = m ~ and the photon charge rather

Now let us turn to our four advertised steps from the introduction to this section. Step 1 
is to express the three fiducial measured quantities in terms of Lagrangian parameters e, 
mz and s:

with the real part of I1zz implicit in the last equation. The left-hand sides of these three 
equations are the measured values while the right-hand sides are formal expressions in 
terms of renormalized MS Lagrangian parameters. 
Step 2 is to invert these equations (to leading order in ae ) giving e, mz and 8 in tenus 
of e, mz and Gp:

(31.39) 
Since these vacuum polarization graphs are already I-loop, we can use either mz and mw 
or mz and mw as the arguments of these vacuum polarization graphs. The difference is 
formally beyond the order we are working. 
It is not hard to get an expression for 8 2 instead of 8 2C2 using trigonometric identities. 
In terms of .§2, defined in Eq. (31.11) as the value of sin2ew extracted directly from our 
fiducial observables, we find 
(31.40) 
Step 3 is to express the other observables first in terms of Lagrangian parameters. For 
Ae we have already done this in Eq. (31.32). For mw, usin!:~ mtv = c2m1 and Eq. (31.22) 
we get

Next, we need to evaluate the various vacuum polarization amplitudes, which we can then 
plug in to get our experimental predictions. 
31.1.2 Electroweak vacuum polarization loops 
Now let us evaluate all the vacuum polarization graphs. We will focus on the contributions 
from the top quark, which gives the largest effect (proportional to ~ 
), and from the 
bottom quark, which is required by SU(2) invariance. The Higgs boson contributions are 
also important, but we leave their computation as an exercise (Problem 31.3). To compute 
IIij , we need to perform loops with left- or right-handed insertions. We will do this for 
general masses and couplings and then insert the appropriate masses and couplings for the 
appropriate self-energy function. 
The fermion contributions to the vacuum polarization functions come from loops such as 
(31.44) 
where the two masses ml and m 2 can be different (for example in IIww). The LL or RR 
amplitudes at I-loop are 
where 
6. = xm~ + (1- x)mi - x(l- X)p2 . 
(31.46) 
There is also a pl-'pV term, which we will just drop from now on since it does not contribute 
to the observables due to Ward identities. Stripping off the iglW as in Eq. (31.17) and 
expanding with d = 4 - c we get

The LR integral requires a mass insertion to turn R ;-; L so it must be odd in the masse 
By dimensional analysis we therefore expect it will be proportional to ml m2· The exa~~ 
result is 
(31.48) 
so that 
(31.49) 
As a check, the above calculation with ml = m2 = me should reproduce the QED vacuum 
polarization amplitude (vector-vector or IIvv). We find 
(31.50) 
This is proportional to p2 and agrees with the result for the vacuum polarization graph in 
Eq. (16.45), since II~1/ = gJLVIIvv. 
With these amplitudes, it is straightforward to plug in the charges and work out the 
vacuum polarization arnpliLUdes for the I jW j Z fields. IIww is proportional to IILL, since 
il only involves lefl-handed fields and II" is proportional to IIvv. For IIzz and IIz, we 
can 1I e lhat the Z boo 00 couples t T3 - s2Q with strength - {c (see Eq. (31.4)) to write 
everything in terms of vector and left-handed amplitudes. For a single (t, b) doublet, we get 
(31.51) 
i=t,b 
(31.52) 
(31.53) 
Here 6 ij means 6 with ml = mi and m2 = mj. The factor of N = 3 comes from 
the three colors of quarks; the ~ in II ww from the normalization of the VV ± generators; 
the ~IIvv comes from the T 3/hypercharge mixing, II3y ex: IILR + IIRR = ~IIvv. Note 

31.1 Electroweak precision tests 
that, since the IIij start at l-loop, it does not matter which definitions of sand e we use in 
these expressions. One can easily substitute the charges Qt = ~, Qb = - ~, T? = ~ and 
rt = -
~ to simplify these formulas, but the more general formulas help illustrate where 
some cancellations come from. 
With these results, we can now evaluate how the top and bottom quarks affect our 
predictions. For example, expanding out Eq. (31.43) gives

Let us first check that the divergent parts (and hence also the f.l-dependent parts) of this and 
m?V,pole in Eq. (31.42) are zero. Noting that

the divergent parts are 
(31.57) 
(31.58) 
(31.59) 
Using only Qt -
Qb = 1 = IQw± I we find that S:ff and m~V,pole would be finite if 
Ivtbl
2 = 1. For Ivtbl ~ 1, one must include all the other quark loops to see the finiteness. 
Doing so, we would find the divergent part of I1ww is 
(31.61) 
where unitarity of the CKM matrix has been used. Thus, the CKM matrix elements drop 
out of the divergent parts of the vacuum polarization graphs. Since the finite parts of loops 
involving light quarks are proportional to the light-quark masses, we can neglect their cor-
rections. Including the m; contributions from the top-bottom, top-strange and top-down 
graphs is therefore equivalent to including just the m; contribution from one of these 
graphs with vtb = 1. Thus, we set vtb = 1 and include just the top-bottom loop. 
Since the divergent contributions to our predictions for mrv,pole and s:rr (and hence Ae) 
cancel, we can now evaluate the I-loop corrections to these observables. To do so, the only 
remaining issue is what value to take for the electric charge and top mass. 
651 

652 
Precision tests of the Standard Model 
---------------------------------------------------------
For the electric charge, we must first convert the on-shell value from Eq. (31.8) to th 
_ 
e 
MS scheme at /-L = 0 and then run up to mz. The leading-order vacuum polarization dia. 
gram II-II determines the leading-order running coupling. Since we have to run Over a large 
range of energy to get an accurate value of e( mz) we hould incJud all charged particles 
and subleading-Ioop running. The running has in facl been calculated up to 4-100ps, and 
the current best MS value of the fine-structure constant at mz is given in Eq. (3l.9). We 
will simply use that value, since renormalization group evolution has already been COvered 
in Chapter 23. 
The current experimental value of the top mass is mt,pole = 173.5 ± 1.0 Ge V. This is the 
value of a parameter in Monte-Carlo simulations which produce distributions with the best 
fit to the observed line shape. Since this shape is approximately Breit-Wigner, we conclUde 
that this value corresponds most closely to the real pole mass defined in Section 24.l.4. Of 
course, working only at I-loop, it does not matter whether we use the top-quark pole mass 
or the MS mass in the oblique corrections, since differences are higher order. However, 
because of the strong (quadratic) dependence of the oblique corrections on the top mass, 
subleading (2-100p and higher) effects can be large. Large logarithms in these higher-order 
amplitUdes can be minimized by using the scale-dependent top-quark mass mt(/-L) in the 
MS scheme rather than the pole mass mt,pole' Converting to the MS mass using 3-loop 
QCD corrections gives [Melnikov and van Ritbergen, 2000] 
mt(mt) = mt,pole [1 _ ~ a 8 ~mt) _ 9.125 (aS ~i)) 2 _ 80.405 (as~t)) 3] 
= 163.0 GeV, 
(3l.62) 
where as(mt) = 0.1088 has been used. Note that there is a 10.5 GeV difference between 
the pole and the MS top-quark masses, so this is a fairly large effect. The W -boson 
and Z-boson masses should technically also be used in the MS scheme. However, since 
these particles are colorless, the scheme dependence is small and the difference can be 
neglected.2 
Now we can compute the I-loop corrections to Ae and mW,pole' Using the values 
discussed above, mt(md = 163.0 GeV, ae(mz) = 0.007816, mz = 91.1876 GeV, 
mb = 4.18 GeV and 82 = 0.234289, we gel 
mW,pole = 80.368 GeV. 
(31.63) 
Comparing to the experimental value m~~P = 80.399 ± 0.023 GeV we now find good 
agreement. We also get S;ff = 0.2313, giving a prediction 
Ae = 0.1491 
(31.64) 
to be compared to the experimental value A~xp = 0.1514 ± 0.0019. Both of these predic-
tions are now within nncertainlie 
f the dara. tn case you are curious, if we had used the top 
pole mass instead ofM 01, s, the I-loop val,ues would have been mW,pole = 80.440 GeV 
and Ae = 0,1522,

sensitive to the top mass, This sensitivity is related to mh = 0 not being technically natural and the hierarc Y 
problem, In the Standard Model, it turns out that mh,poie = 125 GeV gives mh(mh) = 124 GeV, so the 
difference happens to be numerically small.

These approximations give mW,pole = 80.285 and S;ff = 0.2314, which leads to Ae =

In addition to the topibottom contlibution, the other reasonably sized correction is from 
the Higgs boson. We use the value 
mH,pole = 125 GeV 
(31.67)

and S;ff = 0.2314, which gives Ae = 0.1477. These values are summarized in Table 31.1. 
31.2 Custodial SU(2), p, 5, T and U 
In the Standard Model, the W-boson and Z-boson masses have a ratio determined by the 
relative strengths of the weak and electromagnetic gauge couplings. That is, 
(31.70) 
653 

654 
Precision tests of the Standard Model 
...... ----------------------------------------------
This is a consequence of the way the SU(2) x U(l) symmetry is spontaneously brOke 
through the Higgs mechanism with a single SU(2) doublet. If the Higgs sector were rnor: 
complicated, there might be deviations from this, even at tree-level. It is therefore Useful to 
define something called the p-parameter, defined as 
(31.71) 
Denoting the tree-level value of P as Po, we see that Po = 1 in the Standard Model. 
Since the W -boson and Z -boson masses and the gauge couplings 9 and g' have nothin 
to do with the linear-sigma-model field h (the Higgs), it is natural to wonder what exact[~ 
guarantees that Po = 1. That is, can we see that Po = 1 purely from the low-energy 
effective theory, the nonlinear sigma model? The answer is yes; Po = 1 is guaranteed by a 
symmetry. To see this symmetry, recall that our original Higgs doublet H transformed as a 
doublet under SU(2). Writing H = ~ (~~ : ~~:), we see that the potential 
V(H) = A( HtH - V22) 2 = ~(hi + h~ + h~ + h~ _ V2)2 
(31.72) 
is actually invariant under a larger 80(4) symmetry, under which the quadruplet 
(hI , h2, h3 , h4 ) transforms in the fundamental representation. Note that SO( 4) has six gen-
erators, which is twice as many as SU(2). When H gets a vev (such as with hI = v and 
hz = h3 = h4 = 0) the 80( 4) symmetry is broken down to 80(3). Thus there are actually 
three unbroken (global) symmetry directions in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. 
In other words, there is a residual global SU(2) symmetry after electroweak symmetry 
breaking. This is known as custodial isospin or custodial SU(2). 
Despite the fact that we have introduced this symmetry as acting on H , it is not hard 
to see that it actually just acts on the Goldstone bosons. Thus, it should be present in the 
low-energy theory. In fact, it is even present in the 4-Fermi theory. The charged-current and 
neutral-current 4-Fermi interactions, coming from Wand Z exchange respectively, are

(31.74) 
So we see that the custodial symmetry forcing Po = 1 is just the symmetry that relates 
the strength of the weak part of the neutral-current interactions to the strength of the 
charged-current interaction. (If we restore the SU(2)L symmetry with Goldstone bosons, 
this equality of coupling strengths would translate to the equality F; = F;,2, which is 
guaranteed by the custodial SU (2).) 
As an example, COll. ider eleclroweak symmetry breaking by QCD. Recall that even if 
we did not have a Higg 
ector at all we would still have S (2) x U(l) -4 U(l) by the 
QeD (qq) condcl1!~ate . If this were the only source of electroweak ymmetry breaking, 

31.2 custodial SU(2), p, S, T and U 
655 
~-------------------------------------- ~=== 
would we still find Po = I? The answer is yes, because QeD does have a custodial 
SlJ(2) symmetry. In the massless quark limit, QeD has a full SU(2)L x SU(2)R sym-
metry, since the strong interactions treat the left- and right-handed fields identically. After 
symmetry breaking, since only SU(2)L has associated gauge bosons, the breaking would 
be SU(2)L x SU(2)R -> SU(2)j/, where this SU(2)v symmetry is precisely the custo-
dial symmetry that relates the vV-boson and Z-boson masses to the gauge charges. That 
chiral symmetry is broken in QeD is non-trivial but can be proved (at least in the 3-flavor 
case) using anomaly-matching arguments discllssed in Section 30.6. There are many the-
ories without custodial SU(2). For example, a theory with Higgs triplets instead of Higgs 
doublets generically does not have the symmetry. 
The custodial SU(2) symmetry relates SU(2)weak partners, such as the up and down 
quarkS, or top and bottom quarks. The Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model generally 
do not respect custodial SU(2). Mostly, the breaking is a small effect, since most of the 
Yukawa couplings are small. The exception is the top quark, whose Yukawa coupling is 
close to 1. Thus, the dominant contribution to ,0,p = p - 1 in the Standard Model is from 
the top quarks. 
To see how the top quark affects the p parameter, we first need a better definition; 
Eq. (31.71) depends on which version of sin2Bw we use. Traditionally, p is defined to mea-
sure the difference between the charged-current and neutral-current interaction strengths. 
The charged-current strength G ;harged can be measured from muon decay. The neutral-
current strength can, in principle, be measured from pure neutrino- neutrino scattering. 
Following Eq. (31.27), the neutral current strength is

In the same way that looking for deviations of p from 1 can tell us about custodial-
SU(2)-violating interactions, it is useful to have some additional ways to constrain and 
characterize new physics. To this end, the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U are 
often used [Peskin and Takeuchi, 1992]. These are defined as 
(31.79) 
(31.80)

where a e is ac(mz). Here new means that S, T and U are normalized by subtracting off 
the Standard Model prediction. S = T = U = 0 is defined with mt = 173 Ge V and mh = 
126 GeY. Current experimental measurements give S = 0.03 ± 0.10, T = 0.05 ± 0.12 and 
U = 0.03 ± 0.10. The actual allowed region is an ellipse, as shown in Figure 31.1. Thus. 
if you propose a model of physics beyond the Standard Model, you can calculate Sand T 
as a ShOltcUt to comparing with electroweak precision data. 
In practice, Sand T tend to give stronger constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model 
physics than U. T measures custodial isospin violation, since it is equivalent to p. S 
would get a contribution, for example, from a new generation of fermions, even if custodial 
isospin were preserved. For a new doublet, we would have

where ~1,2 are the fermion masses and Yi are the hypercharges. The mass splitting violates 
isospin and is strongly constrained by T. Even for one new multiplet with degenerate 
masses S is in conflict with experiment. 
An important application is that S strongly constrains models of new physics that replace 
the Higgs with QCD-like dynamics. As long as custodial isospin is preserved in these 
technicolor theories, T will be OK, but S will in general get contributions proportional to 
the number of techniquarks. For a single doublet, with lYe = 4 for technicolor, we might 
find S = 3~ = 0.45, which is severely ruled out. 
It is also often useful to think about Sand T as coming from higher-dimension operators. 
For example, suppose the Standard Model were augmented with the following operators: 
(3l.84) 
At tree-level, we would get contributions to Sand T proportional to the Wilson coefficients 
for these operators. In practice, one can take one's favorite model of new physics, for exam-
ple supersymmetry, integrate out the new particles before breaking electroweak symmetry, 
and then look at the coefficients C sand CT of the operators Os and OT that are generated 
by integrating out the new particles. Then S = 
4~CV 2CS and T = -
2~ V 2CT. It is often 
easier to use this shortcut than to compute the contributions of new physics to the vacuum 
polarization graphs and electroweak precision observables directly. 
31.3 Large logarithms in flavor physics 
So far in this chapter we have studied electroweak precision tests. These exploit the fact 
that the renormalizability of the Standard Model overconstrained the gauge sector. The 
Standard Model is also overconstrained in the flavor sector. As we saw in Chapter 29, the 
CKM matrix, based on three generations of quarks, must be unitary. Unitarity constrains 
various combinations of the CKM elements, such as 
(31.85) 
One way to visualize this constraint is the unitarity triangle, discussed in Section 29.3.3. 
To test if Eq. (31.85) is satisfied, we must be able to extract the CKM elements from data. 
To do so at high accuracy requires precision experimental and theoretical physics. 
Consider, for example, the extraction of the CKM elements V cb. This element char-
acterizes the strength of the aYb coupling in the Standard Model Lagrangian. Thus, it 
shows up in quark-level b -; c transitions. Of course, quarks are not directly observed, so 
one can only measure this transition rate indirectly through the decay rates of the various 
hadrons. An important class of measurements from which CKM elements are extracted are

Unfortunately, the process 13° -+ D+1f- is in fact much more complicated than the 
underlying quark-level process b -+ cud. Due to poorly known non-pelturbative hadronic 
matrix elements, there is a huge uncertainty in the prediction for the meson decay eVen 
with an accurate calculation of the quark decay rate (one approach to constraining the 
non-perturbative part using perturbative physics in the heavy-quark limit is discussed in 
Chapter 35). To understand the conuibution from perturbative Standard Model phYsics 
the subject of this chapter, let us for simplicity assume that the relationship between th~ 
13° -+ D+1f- decay rate and Vcb is known. 
What we will consider here is how radiative corrections from QCD affect the relationship 
between lIcb at the scale of the mass of the B hadron (rv5 Ge V) and Vcb at the scale of 
electroweak symmetry breaking (rv 100 Ge V), where unitarity of the CKM matrix should 
hold. As you can easily imagine, the b -+ cud decay rate when calculated to I-loop in QeD 
will give a large logarithmic correction of the form a s In %: . This logarithm is large and 
can have an important effect on the decay rate and hence on the extraction of the correct 
Vcb. The goal of this section is to calculate this large logarithm and similar logarithms to 
all orders in as. 
31.3.1 Matching to the 4-Fermi theory 
The b -+ cud decay is well-described by the 4-Fermi theory. We formally introduced the 
4-Fermi theory in Chapter 29, where we observed that the W- and Z-boson propagator 
can be effectively repJaced by i9~v and ilt'~" when the typical eoergie are much lower than 
mil' 
m? 
mw and mz. Thus the Lagrangian with lne full weak interaction would be equivalent to 
a simpler Lagrangian with just current-CUlTent interacti.ons among the fermion. We will 
now make this correspondence precise beyond leading order. 
What we want to have is some non-renormalizable effective Lagrangian with no W or 
Z which reproduces all the physics of the full elecu'oweak theory, up to corrections that 
are suppressed by powers of E /mw . We expect our Lagrangian to be 
L = -~F~v -
~ (G~v)2 + ~ 
1/;q (iJ/J - mq) 1/Jq - ~ 
CnOn(x), 
(31.86) 
q 
n 
with FJ.Lv the QED field strength, G~v the QCD field strength and On(x) a set of com-
posite local operators constructed out of fermions, covariant derivatives, and QED Of QeD 
field strengths. The Wilson coefficients Cn are numbers. They can depend on the renor-
malization group scale /1 and on constants such as mw, but not on momenta. Momentum 
factors should appear as derivatives in the operators On. In the case of the electroweak 
theory, the only scale that can appear in Cn is mw rv mz. So, by dimensional analysis, 
the higher the dimension of the operator, the more the matrix elements of that operator will 

31.3 Large logarithms in flavor physics 
-------------------------------------------~~-------------------
be suppressed at energies E « mw· The great thing about an effective Lagrangian such as 
Bq. (31.86) is that you can compute the Wilson coefficients by matching to the full theory 
[or one process and then use them to compute amplitudes for other processes. That is, the 
Wilson coefficients are independent of the external state. Although we have not yet proved 
it, this fact is the essential content of Wilson's operator product expansion (to be discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 32). 
The amplitude for the transition b -> cud in the Standard Model is given at tree-level by 
rr- exchange: 
fv/= 
b 
(31.87) 
where i and j are color indices and qL == 1-;/5 q. For p2 « mrv, this same amplitude is 
reproduced by a Lagrangian term -C10 1 with 
(31.88) 
and 
(31.89) 
where ~ = 8 
2 e.~ 2 (j 
. This is the tree-level matching result. Note that we are employ-
v2 
mw Sln 
w 
ing an efficient abbreviation: the same notation is used for the quark fields in Eq. (31.88) 
and for the external spinors in Eq. (31.87). 
31.3.2 One-loop matching 
Since as rv 0.1 » a e rv 0.01, electroweak corrections at I-loop are typically comparable 
in strength to 2-100p QCD corrections (for processes involving quarks). Thus, we will 
work to 1-100p in as and ignore electroweak effects. To perform the matching, we need 
to demand that matrix elements of the quarks be the same in both theories to order as. 
If the theories are matched properly, this equivalence should hold for any final state. An 
obvious choice is to pick on-shell initial and final states, relevant for the b -> cud decay. 
An alternative approach is to match by considering cb -> ud, with the external momenta 
all set to zero. This will give an off-shell matrix element inVOlving fewer scales at the 
cost of possibly introducing IR divergences. Since we will be working in dimensional 
regularization, having fewer scales makes the calculation much easier than it would be 
with on-shell external states.

the physical large logarithms we are trying to understand through effective field theory. 
To match onto the full theory with the effective theory, it is clear from Eq. (3l.l07) that 
we are going to need two operators

now compute the I-loop corrections in the effective theory. 
In the 4-Fermi theory, the I-loop graphs have no W propagator at all, and we get 
the leading coefficient C 1 = G in front of the whole diagram. Without the W propagator, 
the diagrams are now UV divergent. For each diagram MA through M G, there are 
contributions from both 0 1 and O2 . For example,

Note that these Wilson coefficients are IR finite (they do not depend on EfR). In other 
words, the IR-divergent terms from loops in the full theory have been reproduced by loops 
in the effective theory. The cancellation of IR divergences is a self-consistency check. As 
long as we are only integrating out heavy particles, such as the TV, IR divergences should 
cancel in the matching. If they did not, it would mean the infrared degrees of freedom are 
different in the two theories and we have not just integrated out short-distance physics.

a physical scale, such as the B mass. If this were all we could do with the effective theory 
it would not be very useful - we might as well use the full theory which gets the E / rnu: 
behavior right too. The real power of the effective theory is that we can now solve the 
RGEs to resum these logarithms. We saw how this works in Chapter 23. This is a practical 
application of those methods. 
To calculate the RGE, we need the anomalous dimensions of 0 1 and O2 . These are 
determined by the operator renormalizations. We can write our general Lagrangian with 
these operators as 
(31.115) 
where Oi are renormalized operators depending on renormalized fields. From the 
counterterms above, Eq. (31.112), we see that 
(3l.116) 
These two counterterms cancel all of the I-loop UV divergences in the effective theory. 
The RG evolution is obtained by demanding that the bare Lagrangian be independent of 
the arbitrary scale p,. First, we write out the operators in terms of bare fields: 
0 1 = (cn'"h) (dn'"UL) = z; 
(c~)"Y," b~)) (d~)"Y'"u~)) , 
21jJ 
(31.117)

in Chapter 26. In Feynman gauge, from Eq. (26.62),

To solve the RGE, we simply diagonalize the matrix. The eigenoperators are

0 0 = "2(01 + 02), 
0 3 = "2(01 - O2). 
(31.122) 
The new subscripts reflect a type of isospin quantum number. Since 0 0 is symmetric under 
d r> c it is a singlet while 0 3 , which is antisymmetric, is a triplet. The symmetry is of 
course broken by quark masses, but the UV divergences of the theory are independent of 
these masses. So the matching at p, = rnw gives 
Co(rnw) = C[l + 4~as(rnw)], C3 (rnw) = C[l- 2~as(rnw)] , 
and these run with 
as 
10=-,

as 
13 = -2-.

The RGEs can be easily integrated in the diagonal basis using 
(3l.l23) 
(31.124) 
(31.125) 
Using the I-loop anomalous dimension and (30 with nf = 5 (there are five active flavors 
between rnw and rnb) this gives 
Starting with as(rnz) = 0.1184, we run as at I-loop to find as(rnw) 
as(rnb) = 0.213. Plugging in these numbers leads to 
which implies 
(3l.l26) 
0.121 and 
(3l.l27) 
(31.128) 
The root-mean-square value of these, which is relevant for the b -+ cdu decay rate, is 
JC?(rnb) + C~(rnb) = l.09C, which is 9% higher than the tree-level value, and 11 % 
higher than the I-loop value JCf(rnw) + C?(rnw ) = 0.98C. 
Now recall that C == 
4~ Vcb Vu~. Suppose we had an accurate way to relate the 
4-Fermi theory at the scale rnb to the hadronic B -+ DJr decay rate (for example if 
hadronic matrix elements were known from the lattice). We could then use the measured 
rate r (B -+ DJr) ex: Web 12 to extract Veb. If one did not include the loop corrections, since 
the rate is quadratically sensitive to Vcb, the extracted value would come out 18% too low. 
This could falsely indicate that the CKM matrix is not unitary and give incorrect indications 
of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. 
Conveniently, we do not have to calculate the running from rnw down to the GeV 
scale on our own for every possible calculation. Instead, we can just integrate out new 
physics at rnw, match onto a standard set of operators, and use precomputed results. 
There is a standard basis, including 0 1 and O 2 up to Og, and additional operators such

One of the most remarkable results in all of physics is that the existence and properties 
of the proton can be explained by a local quantum field theory based on the gauge group 
SU(3). This result is additionally remarkable because, although we know QeD predicts 
the proton, we cannot prove it. Despite the powerful tools we have developed for doing 
perturbative calculations, we only know how to apply QeD to particles that are colored, 
not color-neutral particles such as hadrons. In this chapter, we will explore the connection 
between perturbative QeD and hadron physics. 
We have discussed two methods for studying hadrons so far. The first, chiral pertur-
bation theory (Section 28.2), takes from QeD only its symmetries. These symmetries 
are very powerful, and constrain the possible interactions that hadrons (especially the 
light mesons) can have, allowing for quantitative quantum predictions. Unfortunately, the 
Chiral Lagrangian is non-renormalizable, so one would need an infinite number of mea-
surements to make an infinite number of predictions. Since the Chiral Lagrangian cannot 
be matched systematically to QeD within a perturbative framework (in contrast to, say, 
how the 4-Fermi theory is matched to the electroweak theory), there are some questions it 
simply cannot answer. The other method is lattice QCD (Section 25.5). Lattice QCD lets 
us calculate any desired hadronic property, at least in principle. From a practical perspec-
tive, lattice calculations are still extremely computationally expensive. Moreover, there are 
some quantities, in particular scattering amplitudes, that are not well suited to lattice cal-
culations at all. To calculate what happens when we collide two protons, neither of these 
methods are adequate. 
Intuitively, it seems reasonable that perturbative QeD should have some predictive 
power for high-energy proton scattering. Although hadrons are strongly interacting, the 
strong force is scale dependent and becomes weak at very short distances (Section 26.6). 
Thus, one expects a collision between hadrons at very high energy to be dominated by inter-
actions among essentially free quarks or gluons, and perturbative QCD to be applicable. 
What is not obvious is whether perturbative calculations can be connected to experimen-
tal observations. In fact they can, due to the power of tools such as the operator product 
expansion and effective field theory. These tools allow us to make precise the factorization 
of short-distance from long-distance physics. 
QCD is an extremely rich subject. It is obviously impossible to cover all the important 
topics in one chapter. Instead, we will focus here on some aspects of perhaps the most 
important process in QeD: e-p+ scattering. We will begin with a historically oriented 
discussion of how the proton was understood by experiments that bombarded electrons at 
protons at very high energies. This will lead to the parton model, which was a precursor to 
QCD. We will then discuss the field theory version of the parton model and the DGLAP

32.1 Electron-proton scattering 
Electron-proton scattering is one of the best ways to study hadrons: it uses an essentially 
pointlike structureless probe (the electron) to make precision measurements of the pro-
ton. This is not dissimilar to the way Rutherford and collaborators discovered the atomic 
nucleus by slamming a-particles into thin metal sheets. From the resulting distributions, 
not only were they able to conclude that atoms had a hard center, but they also got a rough 
estimate of the size of the nucleus. 
32.1.1 Rutherford's experiment 
Rutherford and his team (Geiger and Marsden) produced a-particles (helium nuclei) from 
the decay of radon atoms. These a-particles have velocities around 2 x 107 m/s, giving 
them a kinetic energy of around 8 Me V. When shooting these "bullets" at a very thin sheet 
(a few atoms thick) of foil they sometimes found scattering angles greater than 90°. This 
was totally unexpected, considering the currently popular Thomson model (where the neg-
atively charged electrons are embedded in a positively charged medium, like plums in a 
pudding). Rutherford famously said, "It was quite the most incredible event that ever hap-
pened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you had fired a IS-inch shell at a 
piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you." [Andrade, 1964, p.lll]. 
To calculate the expected distribution, Rutherford used a classical model (of course he 
did, this was 191] i). Assuming a central Coulomb potential, the scattering angle e is fixed 
by the energy E and impact parameter b of the collision to be

Rutherford's group found a distribution consistent with this formula. 
Actually, Rutherford was hoping to find deviations from his scattering formula, which 
would have indicated new interactions of the electron with the nucleus. That he did not 
find any indicated to him that the a-particles must stop before they hit the nucleus. Using 
conservation of energy at zero impact parameter, an upper bound ?'rnax

nucleus is then given by -21rnv2 = 42Ze

4.8 X 10- 15 m [Rutherford, 191 I], which was his e timate for the maximal size of the 
nucleus. Incidentally, his best estimate came not from his famous gold foil but from lighter 
aluminum foil, a much less exotic material. To improve on this, one would like to take 
the smallest nucleus possible (a proton), the smallest probe possible (an electron), and the 
highest energy possible. This leads to high-energy e- p+ collisions. But it was not until 50 
years after Rutherford that the nucleus could be unraveled this way. 
32.1.2 Elastic e- p+ scattering 
Suppose the proton were structureless too, like the muon. Then we would expect e-p+ 
scattering to look like e- J-l+ scattering. In fact, it does, at least at low energy. The leading 
Feynman diagram is just the t-channel photon exchange diagram, which we have studied 
many times: 
(32.3) 
We call this Coulomb scattering. That the proton is composite is only relevant for pho-
tons that have enough energy to see its compositeness - at low energy, the proton is 
indistinguishable from an elementary fermion such as the muon. 
The relativistic cross section for Coulomb scattering of two spin-~ particles was 
calculated in Eq. (13.103) of Chapter 13:

(32.4) 
where E and E' are the electron's initial and final energies and qJ.L = kJ.L -

() = 0 is forward scattering. These quantities are related by 
q2=-2k'k'= - (4E'ESin2~) 
.

This formula applies in the lab frame, where the proton is initially at rest. Another use-
ful relation is that in the lab frame q2 = 2mp(E' - E). The derivation of Eq. (32.4)

used me = 0, so one cannot take the non-relativistic limit directly. Nevertheless, the no 
relativistic limit of e- p+ scattering in QED does reduce to the Rutherford formula n-
. 
, as 
explained in SectIOn 13.4. 
Equation (32.4) is carefully written in terms of only quantilie lhal can be measUr 
from the initial and final state electron. Thi i very important since the early - ~ 
scattering experiments, such as Hofstadter's famoLi experiment at 
t3nfol'd in the I:id 
1950s, collided electron beams with hydrogen ga , and only the olitgoiJlg electrons Could 
be measured. The first 47f detector, that is, one that measures all of the final-state particles 
including the proton remnants, was not built until 1973 (the MARK I detector at SLAC). A~ 
we will see, a tremendous amount can be and was learned about protons by just studyin 
the outgoing electrons. 
g 
If we did not know about QCD (as in the 1950s) we might have expected Eq. (32.4) to 
hold up to arbitrarily small distances. For example, a similar formula does appear to hold 
up to arbitrarily small distances for electron-muon scattering, which proceeds primarily 
through QED. Even in QED, Eq. (32.4) gets quantum corrections, as we saw for e+ fJ,-
scattering in Chapter 20. To study these corrections, it is helpful to remove the electron 
from the problem and think of an off-shell photon with spacelike momentum q/l as scatter-
ing off the proton, as in Chapter 20. In Chapter 17 and Section 19.3, we parametrized the 
most general type of interaction between an off-shell photon and a spin- ~ particle in terms 
of two form factors FI and F2 . This parametrization did not assume anything about the 
interactions, and must hold in QCD (or any theory). In this case, as in the QED case, the 
general vertex can be written as u(p') (ief/l) u(p), with u(p') the outgoing proton spinor 
and u(p) the incoming proton spinor, both of which we assume to be on-shell. Then the 
decomposition of f/l into form factors is 
iu/l V 
f/l(q) = FI(q2)r/l + -2 -qvF2(q2). 
mp 
(32.6) 
Recall that in QED FI (q2) gets divergent contributions, and must be renormalized, while 
F2 (q2) is finite. The on-shell renormalization condition FI (0) = 1 in this case normalizes 
the proton charge to Q = +1 at large distances. At I-loop in QED F2 (O) = ~, which 
gives the correction to the electron magnetic moment, usually expressed as its g-factor 
ge = 2 + ~ + .... 
For the proton, we know its magnetic moment: con'esponds to a g-factor of gp = 5.58, 
which is not close to 2. This suggests that the proton is not just a point particle like the 
electron. (The neutron's g-factor is gn = -3.82, which also seems very strange in pertur-
bation theory, considering that the neutron is neutral.) Repeating the tree-level Coulomb 
scattering calculation using the ieuf/lu vertex (which is not hard, since q2 is fixed), we get

This is known as the Rosenbluth formula. 
If the proton had only interacted through QED, FI(q2)and F2(q2) would be calculable 
and could be compared to data. For example, consider e-T+ scattering. The tauon is a 
lepton whose mass l. 7 Ge V is close to the proton mass. For e- T+ scattering, H (q2)

Here a definite scale 0.71 Gey2 appears, even in differences such as Fl (qi) - FI (q~). 
Form factors are particularly useful because they correspond to the Fourier transforms of 
scattering potentials, through the Born approximation (see Section 5.2). Indeed, up to some 
kinematic factors and normalization, FI(q2) = J d3xeiq.xV(x), which leads to V(r) = 
3 
711" e- mr in this case. Thus, the form of the proton is characterized by an exponential shape 
p(r) ~ e- r / ro , with characteristic size ro ~ (O.84Gey)-1 ~ Hm. 
The conclusion is that the proton has a characteristic size of order 1 fm. The value of this 
size is not surprising, since it is of the order of the proton's Compton wavelength. What 
is surprising is that there is a scale at all! In scattering electrons off tauons, all we would 
ever see is a form factor with logarithmic dependence on energy. The tauon's size is not of 
order m;; I; if it has a finite size at all, it is much, much smaller than m;; 1. 
To learn more about the proton, experiments had to go to higher energy. At energies 
Iq21 > 1 Ge y2, you might expect e- p+ to elucidate an even more complicated charge dis-
tribution with more and more scales. Instead, somewhat shockingly (from an experimental 
point of view), they simplify back to the point scattering case. That is, very high energy 
e- p+ scattering reveals pointlike constituents within the proton, now known as quarks. We 
will next explain how to see this simplification. 
32.1.3 Inelastic e- p+ scattering 
Up until now we have discussed elastic scattering: e-p+ -7 e-p+. At center-of-mass ener-
gies above m p , the proton can stalt to break apart. For example, at high enough energies, 
the reaction e-p+ -7 e- p+ 1r° can occur. At very high energies, the proton breaks apart 
completely, as shown in Figure 32.1. Remarkably, the physics simplifies in this deeply 
inelastic regime, and we will be able to make precise theoretical predictions. 
In deriving the parametrization of the cross section in terms of FI (q2) and F2 (q2) , 
we needed to use the reduction of the photon- proton interactions to terms of the form 
U(p')'yMU(p) or u(p')uMVqMU(p). When the proton breaks apart, as in deep inelastic scat-
tering (DIS), this parametrization will no longer do. Instead, we need to parametrize 
photon-proton-X interactions, where X is anything the proton can break up into. Thus, 
it makes sense to parametrize the cross section (instead of the vertex) in terms of the 
momentum transfer qM and the proton momentum Pi".

Quantum chromodynamics and the parton model 
----
As energy is increased, e-p+ scattering goes from elastic to slightly inelastic, with e-p+ 'lr0 
in the final state, to deeply inelastic, where the proton breaks apart completely. 
In the lab frame, the kinematics are shown in Figure 32.1. We define E and E' as the 
energies of the incoming and outgoing electron. We also define e as the angle between k 
and k', so e = 0 is forward scattering. The cross section can be written as 
(32.10) 
where L/LV is the leptonic tensor, which encodes polarization information for the elec-
tron or, equivalently, the off-shell photon. We already used a parametrization like this in 
Chapter 20 while discussing IR divergences. There the e+ e- -+ 1-"+ I-" - ( +,) cross section 
simplified using the same lepton tensor. For unpolarized scattering, the lepton tensor is 
(32.11) 
where k and k' are the electron's initial and final momentum. The factor of ~ comes from 
averaging over the initial electron's spin. Note that L!-'v = LvI-'" 
The hadronic tensor ~T!-,V includes an integral over all the phase space for all final state 
particles (as did X!-,V in Eq. (20.30». It gives the rate for ,*p+ -+ anything:

where E!-, is the polarization of the off-shell photon. Since final states are integrated over, 
TV!-'v can depend on P!-' and q!-' only. In unpolarized scattering, it must be symmetric, 
W!-,V = WV!-,. It also should satisfy q!-, W!-,V = 0 by the Ward identity (see Chapter 14), 
since the interaction is only through a photon. Thus, the most general parametrization is l 
(32.13)

As in the elastic case, we have set everything up so we only have to know the incoming and 
outgoing electron momenta, not anything about the final hadronic state X. That is, Wl and 
W2 can be completely determined by measuring only the energy and angular dependence 
of the outgoing electron. 
The defining assumption of the parton model, originally due to Feynman, is that some 
objects called partons within the proton are essentially free. When we connect to QeD, 
we will see that parton refers to not only quarks, but also the gluons and antiquarks in a 
hadron (and photons and, at least formally, every other particle in the Standard Model too). 
For now, let us just assume that there exist partons within the proton, some of which are 
charged. To test the parton model, we need to determine what the form factors TVl and W2 
would look like if the electron were scattering elastically off partons of mass mq inside the 
proton. An elastic parton scattering diagram is 
(32.17) 
where the circle represents the proton and the three lines coming in and three lines going 
out represent partons within the proton, only one of which participates in the interaction 
with the electron. 
This diagram is not that different from the one for electron-muon scattering. To evaluate 
it, call the scattered parton's initial momentum p; and its final momentum Pj, so that 
p; + q/L = pj by momentum conservation. Squaring both sides gives 
(32.18) 
Unfortunately, the parton momentum is not directly measurable. However, let us just 
assume it has some fraction ~ of the proton's momentum, p; = ~p/L. Then x = Jp~2q = ( 
In particular, if the parton model were valid, then by measuring x we would be measuring 
the fraction of the proton's momentum involved in the parton-level scattering. 
Now let us additionally suppose that the partons are weakly interacting. Then we should 
be able to calculate e- q --+ e- q elastic scattering in perturbation theory. In particular, 
we expect the form factors to have only weak, logarithmic dependence on Q2 Gust as for

this decoherence occurs amounts to a proof of factorization. Factorization is discussed in 
Section 32.4 below. 
With PDFs we can be more precise about the predictions of a theory with weakly inter-
acting partons. The parton model assumption is that the cross section for e- P+ -7 e- X

Here we initiate the standard convention that partonic quantities are given circumfiexes, 
for example 0-. 
Assuming the partons are free except for their QED interactions, the electron can only 
scatter off the charged particles in the proton which we are calling quarks. For a given quark 
momentum Pi, the e- q -'> C q partonic cross section is just like any pointlike scattering 
cross section in QED. It is given by the Rosenbluth formula, Eq. (32.7), with F1 = 1 and 
F2 = O. Before integrating over final electron energy E', the cross section is 
where Qi is the charge of the quark. You can check that Eq. (32.7) with F1 = 1 and 
F2 = 0 is reproduced from this if we integrate over the 6-function in light of the constraint 
in Eq. (32.5). Note that if we did not assume free quarks, there could have been generic 
form factors G1 (Q) and G2 (Q) in front of the sin2 ~ and cos2 ~ terms, as there are for low-
energy e- p+ elastic scattering as in Eq. (32.7). Such form factors would violate Bjorken 
scaling, and their absence is essentially the content of the parton-model prediction for DIS. 
In order to get the DIS cross section from this, we have to integrate over the incoming 
quark momentum. Since pr = ~PI:' and in the lab frame the proton is at rest, this implies 
mq = ~mp. We can also use that E - E' = v = 2:;;:X from Eqs. (32.14) and (32.15) and

accurate ones, demonstrating Bjorken scaling are shown in Figure 32.2. 
Another result of the parton model is that WI (x, Q) = 
~~ W 2 (x, Q) for Q » mp , 
which also follows from Eq. (32.24). This is known as the Callan-Gross relation. The 
proportionality can be traced back to the 2Q

amplitude, which is in turn due to the quarks being free Dirac fermions. Thus the Callan-

with s = E6M' This characteristic 1 + (1 - y) 2 behavior is often identified with the Callan_

Sometimes also dimensionless structure functions are used: 
(32.26) 
so that the Callan-Gross relation becomes .1'1 (x) = 2~.1'2(x) = ~ l:i QUi(X). These:F , 
should not be confused with the Fi in the original proton form factor, despite their alpha-
betical similarity. We will follow the standard convention and use these .1'i form factors in 
the QCD analysis in Section 32.4. 
32.1.4 Sum rules 
For PDFs to be probabilities, they must satisfy some constraints. For example, if the proton 
had exactly one down quark, then the down quark must have some momentum, and so 
J d~ fd(~) = 1. In reality, one can have virtual down-antidown quark pairs within the 
proton, so there can be more than one down quark. However, since down-quark number is 
conserved (in QED and QCD) we have 
(32.27) 
where fd,(O is the down-antiquark PDF. Similarly, because the proton has up-quark 
number of 2 and zero strange-quark number: 
and 
(32.28) 
The strange-quark sum rule also applies for bottom-quark and charm-quark PDFs. There 
is no conserved gluon number, so fg has no associated sum rule. In addition, 
L J 
d~ [Uj(~)l = 1. 
J 
(32.29) 
This sum rule follows from momentum conservation (see Problem 32.2). Each of these 
sum rules cOlTesponds to a classically conserved CUlTent (up, down, strange number or 
momentum). Numerically, itturns out that J d~~(fu(~)+ fd(~)) ~ 0.38. Thus, only around 
38% of the proton momentum is contained in the valence quarks (u and d). The gluon 
content of the proton, given by J d~ Ug(~), ranges from 35% to 50% depending on the 
scale (scale dependence of the PDFs will be discussed shortly). The remainder of the proton 
momentum is in sea quarks (meaning s, c or b quarks and d, il, c, sorb antiquarks).

MSTW parton distribution functions [MSTW group (Martin et al.), 2009] are shown for 
various partons. The central values for xf;ex, J-L) are shown for u, d, 9 and u. The 
factorization scale J-L = 2 GeV is used on the left and J-L = 200 GeV is used on the right. The 
sea quark PDFs other than u are not shown; they are qualitatively similar to the u PDF. 
In practice, the PDFs are determined not just from DIS, but from many other high-energy 
processes, such as pp and pp collisions. There are a number of different groups that perform 
global fits to PDFs. The fits differ by the way they weight different contributions, the order 
in as at which the associated perturbative calculations are performed, and how the PDFs 
are parametrized. Example parton distributions are shown in Figure 32.3. 
32.2 DGLAP equations 
We have seen that qualitatively correct features of DIS, such as Bjorken scaling and the 
Callan-Gross relation, follow from the parton modeL However, one can see already in Fig-
ure 32.2 that Bjorken scaling does not quite hold - there is some weak (logarithmic) Q2 
dependence visible in the structure function. In this section, we will show how the loga-
rithmic Q2 dependence can be calculated by combining the parton model with perturbative 
QCD. Thus, for now, we will continue to assume the parton model holds, so that the e-p+ 
cross section is given by a sum of parton-scattering rates, with the initial parton's energy 
given by classical probability functions 1i (0. In the next section, we will discuss to what 
extent the parton model itself can be proven within QCD. 
In Eq. (32.10) we wrote the e-p+ 
--+ e- X cross section in terms of the lep-
tonic tensor LfJv and the hadronic tensor HIfl"(x, Q), with the hadronic tensor given by 
IM(r*p+ --+ X)1
2 integrated over final states, as in Eq. (32.12). Let us write WfJV(z, Q) 
as the partonic version of WfJV(x, Q), given by IMb*q --+ X)1 2 integrated over final 
states. Here z is the partonic version of x: 
Q2 
z := --. 
2Pi .q 
(32.30) 
Now we use the parton model assumption that the probability of finding pf 
~pi" for 
some 0 .::; ~ .::; 1 is given by a PDF 1i(0. Thus, x = z~ and we have to integrate over~. 
This leads to

Quantum chromodynamics and the parton model 
-----------------------------------------------
(32.31 ) 
Let us check this at leading-order QCD. At order 0 (a~), the only partonic process that 
contIibutes to Wf.LV is "f* q ---> q. Then, with P~' and PI = pr + qf.L the initial and final 
quark momenta, we have

= 21fQ; [( _gf.LV + q~;V) + ~ (pr _ P~~ qqf.L) (pr - p~~ qqv)] 6(1- z). 
(32.32) 
We find TV1 = 21fQ;6(1 - z) = ~:ATV2' confirming the Callan-Gross relation at leading 
order. Plugging this leading-order H/f.LV (z, Q) into Eq. (32.3]) reproduces Eq. (32.24), 
confirming the normalization. 
For simplicity, let us consider the form factor TVa == - gf.LVWf.Lv' For the hadronic tensor, 
Wa(x, Q) == -gf.LvWf.LV = 3W1 (x, Q) - W2 (x, Q) ( m; + ~: ) . 
(32.33) 
For Q » m p , this simplifies to Wa = 3W1 -
~~ TV2 so that Wa = 2W1 at leading order. 
In palticular, 
(32.34) 
This equation motivates using TVa as a definition of PDFs, valid beyond leading order. 
Defining the PDFs in this way lets us calculate the Q dependence of the PDFs, as we will 
now see. In particular, we can now forget about all those confusing structure functions and 
focus on TVa, which is basically just the unpolarized cross section for "f*p+ ---> X. 
At the parton level, at leading order, TV6-'° = 41fQ;6(1 - z). At next-to-Ieading order in 
the parton model in QeD there is a virtual "f* q ---> q graph and s- and t-channel "f* q ---> qg

so that we can just present and discuss the relevant results without repeating similar 
calculational details. 
Using the same techniques described in Chapter 20, we can compute the virtual contri-
butions at NLO (see Eq. (20.A.lGI). The interference between the leading-order graph and 
the loop in Eq. (32.35) in d = 4 -

Looking at these results, it appears that WrY has a -b double pole but TVt does not, 
so that the poles will not cancel. However, there is in fact a -b pole in wt, coming from 
the 1~% (1- z)-~ terms. To see this, we need to use the fact that (1- Z)-I-E expanded 
around 10 = 0 gives a distribution. The relevant identity is

where 
(32.43) 
This distribution, Pqq(z), is known as a DGLAP splitting function, after Dokshitzer 
Gribov, Lipatov, Altarelli and Parisi. 
' 
At this point, all the double poles have canceled, but there is still a single ~ pole in the 
cross section whose residue is proportional to Pqq (z). Having a pole in a parton-level cross 
section is not a problem, as long as it drops out of physical predictions. Focusing on thl' 
A 
s 
pole, we can insert Wo into Eq. (32.31) to get 
Wo(x, Q) = 47r ~ 
Q; 11 ~~ h(O [0 (1 -z) - ~; Pqq (z) (~ + In ~: ) + finite] . 
(32.44) 
Now, using the definition of plus functions, we find that the splitting function in Eq. (32.43) 
satisfies 
(32.45) 
Thus, if we integrate Wo(x , Q) over x, to get the total DIS cross section at a given Q, the 
~ pole exactly vanishes. 
At fixed x the ~ pole does not cancel and Wo(x , Q) is divergent. However, as in many 
other examples (see Chapter 16), we need to take differences of cross sections to find finite 
answers. The difference in Wo(x, Q) at the same x but different scales Q and Qo is 
1.

, 
(32.46) 
This difference is a finite integral. The finite parts of Eq. (32.42) drop out of such dif-
ferences, but the ~ pole in the paI10n-level cross section leads to a physical quantum 
prediction for ilie logarithmic Q dependence of the hadronic cross section. (The finite 
parts ofEq. (32.42) do show up in differences of structure functions [Altarelli et ai. , 1979; 
Sterman, 1993].) 
Why should we have to calculate differences? Should Wo(x, Q) not be observable and 
hence finite without any new renormalization, since QCD is renormalizable? There are two 
answers. First, if we did the calculation in full QCD, the IR divergence would be cut off 
by some physical scale such as a quark mass mq or AQCD . Indeed, the same divergence 
occurs in Compton scattering in QED, and is cut off by the electron mass. However, this 
misses the point. Doing the calculation with massive quarks would replace the logarithm 
by ln~, which for Q » mq would be very large. Thus, ilie second answer is simply that 
the difference between Wo(x, Q) at two scales is a more practical quantity to calculate: 
we can get a testable answer in perturbation theory. Indeed, the logarithm in Eq. (32.46) 
exactly explains the violation of Bjorken scaling seen in Figure 32.2. 
As we have seen many times, renormalization lets us replace the calculation of differ-
ences with the calculation of observables in terms of renormalized quantities. In this case, 

32.2 DGLAP equations 
681 
~----------------------------------------------------- r--_. ... 
we need to define renormalized PDFs. We could do this by saying T1Vo is given exactly 
by Eq. (32.34) at some reference scale Qo. Since Qo is arbitrary, the independence of the 
cross section of Qo should lead to a renormalization group equation. In anticipation of a 
connection to the RG, we define 
(32.47) 
for every scale Q. For this equation to be consistent with Eq. (32.46) we need 
(32.48) 
which implies 
(32.49) 
This is known as a DGLAP evolution equation. It allows us to resum large logarithms in 
structure functions. 
We can do a quick check on the self-consistency of our results. For fq(x) to have a 
probabilistic interpretation, sum rules such as Eq. (32.27) should hold for any p,. Integrating 
over x in Eq. (32.48) and using Eq. (32.45) we see that J fi(X, p,) is indeed p, independent. 
In fact, if we assume Eq. (32.27), one can derive the singular part of Pqq(z) uniquely by 
2 
knowing that for Z > 1 it behaves as \-t:..z
z . This is a shortcut to deriving the splitting 
functions, discussed more in the next section. 
So far we have only considered partonic processes relevant for e-p+ ----t e- X, such 
as ,* q ----t q and ,* q ----t qg, which have quarks in the initial state. At next-to-leading 
order there are also processes such as ,* 9 ----t qq with initial state gluons. Since there is 
a probability of finding antiquarks and gluons in the proton, there are PDFs fij and fg for 
these partons as well. All of these PDFs mix under RG group evolution. Thus, DGLAP is 
really a set of coupled integro-differential equations. For quarks and gluons, these can be 
written in the form 
(32.50) 
The various splitting functions can be derived from cross sections for processes such as 
9 ----t gg or 9 ----t qq as we did for q ----t qg above. At leading order, they are 
Pqq(Z) = CF [[~ ~ :]2+ + ~O(l- Z)] 
Pqg(z) = TF [z2 + (1 - z)2] , 
Pgq(z) = CF [1 + (~- Z)2] ,

32.3 Parton showers 
In the previous section we derived the next-to-Ieading order prediction for deep inelastic 
scattering in the parton model. The key result was that the cross section for "y*q --> qg 
was IR divergent, but that this divergence could be absorbed in renormalized PDFs. In this 
section, we will trace the origin of the IR divergence, discuss its universality, and show 
how that universality can be exploited in an important semi-classical approximation called 
the parton shower. 
While regulating divergences in d = 4 -
f dimensions is efficient mathematically, it 
obscures some of the physics. So let us return to the ,* 
q --; qg cross section and see what 
it looks like in four dimensions. Summing over final state spins and colors and averaging 
over initial state spins and colors, the real emission diagrams in Eq. (32.35) give

satisfy s + i + U = _Q2. The physical region has Q2 = _ q2 > 0, s > 0 and t, u < O. As 
usual, we are putting hats on the partonic quantities. 
Now, \M\2 is singular at s = 0 and at i = O. At fixed incoming partonic momenta 
(fixed z and Q2), S is non-zero; thus, the only relevant singularity for calculating a = 
a( ,* q --; qg) is the i = 0 one. Defining e as the angle between the gluon and the incoming 
quark in the partonic center-of-mass frame, we find 
A

0 = t = (Pg - Pi) = -2pg' Pi = - 4EgE i sm 2' 
(32.57) 
so that the singularity occurs when e --; O. That is, it is a collinear singularity. This same 
collinear singularity occurs in Compton scatteJing in QED, as discussed in Sections 13.5.4 
and 20.3.2. 
In the pmtonic center-of-mass frame, the transverse momentum of the outgoing gluon 
with respect to the incoming quark can be written as p~ = (S~~2)2' The collinear i = 0 
singularity implies PT --; O. At small PT, dD "'-' 'I;" dp~, and the partonic cross section can

where 0-0 = 
7r sQ"-Qr. Here we recognize the non-singular part of the splitting function 
Pqq(z) from Eq. (32.43), although in this case the singularity at z = 1 is unregulated since 
we have worked in four dimensions. The dimensionally regularized calculation shows that 
the residue of the pole at P~ = 0 is the full distribution Pqq (z). A neat trick to derive the 
6" -function and distribution part of Pqq (z) from the z < 1 part is to exploit sum rules such 
as Eq. (32.27), which, to be consistent with Eq. (32.48), imply that Eq. (32.45) must hold 
(as discussed in the previous section). The equivalences in this paragraph all require a fair 
bit of calculation, which we leave to Problem 32.10. 
A remarkable fact about QCD is that the residue of ~ as PT ---+ 0 is always given by 
PT 
Pqq (z) for any process in which a final state gluon goes collinear to a quark. This is true 
both when the quark is in the initial state and when it is in the final state. For example, 
consider the decay rate of a massive vector boson "r* ---+ qqg with ,* having mass Q. The 
diagrams 
(32.59)

Thus, the residue of ~2 for this final state radiation case is proportional to the splitting 
function. In this case z is, by definition, the ratio of the energy carried by the final state 
quark to the energy of the mother parton, that is, the off-shell quark that splits into a 
quark and gluon. Alternatively, we could write the rate in terms of z and the transverse 
momentum of the quark with respect to its mother p~ = ~(l - xI)(l - xg)(l - X2). In 
x, 
that case, we would also find that the residue of ~ is proportional to Pqq (z ).

Quantum chromodynamics and the parton model 
....... --------------------------------------------------
One important use of the universality of the collinear limit is that it leads to an effiCient 
semi-classical approximation used in Monte Carlo simulations. One can interpret the split_ 
ting functions as probabilities for off-shell partons to branch. These probabilities grow as 
t and are largest for very collinear emissions. Since very collinear emi ion ar often not 
measurable, the simulations work by first picking a momentum for the hard t gLuon to 
be emitted, then picking the next hardest and so on, evolving a a Markov proces in a 
virtuality scale t. One can think of evolution in t as evolution in time from the moment of 
the collision, or evolution in distance from the collision point. 
To be more specific, let us integrate over z = 
EEd"ghla. At fixed small t, in which the 
mother 
collinear approximation is valid, z can be small, but not zero. The lower and upper bounds 
on z depend on the variable chosen for t (m2, p} or &Q2), but since these all go to zero 
in the strict collinear limit, the lower bound is z 2: C d2 for some constant c. Thus, for 
t « Q2, the probability of finding any glllon at the scale t is approximately

This should be consistent with the Taylor expansion 6.(to, HtSt) = 6.(to, t)+c5t-!it6.(to, t). 
Therefore 
d

The solution to this differential equation with to = Q2 is

The In2 Sf in this expression is the same Sudakov double logarithm characterizing soft-

32.4 Factorization and the parton model from QeD 
More details about parton showers can be found in [Sjostrand et aI. , 2006, Section 10] and 
[Ellis et aI., 1996, Section 5.2]. 
32.4 Factorization and the parton model 
from QeD 
For practical purposes, the parton model is all one needs to perform perturbative QCD 
calculations relevant for high-energy scattering involving hadrons. This phenomenological 
approach assumes factorization: that PDFs are universal objects, and any scattering pro-
cess involving protons can be computed using the same PDFs with a different perturbative 
calculation. It is remarkable that this procedure works so well, and it is therefore desirable 
to have a precise derivation of factorization. 
Unfortunately, factorization has only been proven in a couple of examples: inclusive 
deep inelastic scattering (where one measures only the outgoing electron) and the Drell-
Yan process (lepton pair production from pp or pp collisions). Even in these cases, the 
proofs are incredibly complicated, with subtlety after subtlety confounding the intuitive 
picture. The rigorous proofs involve characterizing the infrared singular regions of Feyn-
man diagrams (through pinch surfaces and Landau equations) and are beyond the scope 
of this text. We will discuss only the classic factorization proof for inclusive deep inelastic 
scattering using the operator product expansion. This leads to the identification of moments 
of the PDFs with operator matrix elements. In the next section, an alternative and more 
generally useful view of the PDFs as lightcone quark matrix elements is given. 
The first step to proving factorization is to define what exactly we mean by it. Intuitively, 
factorization says that the same universal non-perturbative objects (the PDFs), representing 
the long-distance physics, can be combined with many short-distance calculations in QCD. 
Roughly, 0' = f ® H , where f are the PDFs, H is the perturbative hard calculation, and ® 
denotes a convolution. Such a separation cannot be exactly true: the exact 0' must depend 
on all the brown muck inside the proton. Factorization really means that the calculation 
done this way is COlTect up to something small: 0' = f ® H + 0 ( A'QD ), where Q is 
some characteristic high-energy scale in the process. Already, you can see why proofs in 
cases that are not completely inclusive are so challenging: if there are many measured final 
states, there can be many scales Q and it is hard to make sure they are all always large in 
all regions of phase space. For inclusive DIS, we know what Q is, Q = J -(k - k,)2, 
which we take large while holding x = 
2~~q fixed. Thus, there is some hope that we can 
derive a factorization theorem. 
Our approach will first relate the DIS cross section to a product of currents JJ1. (x) JV (y). 
We then rewrite this product of CUlTents in terms of local operators, JJ1. (x)]V (y) = 
LnCn(x - y) On(x). The DIS limit Q2

----t 0 so that we can Taylor expand the Wilson coefficients Cn(x - y) around 
xJ1. = yJ1., keeping only the leading term. Then, matrix elements of these operators in 
proton states will give us a definition of the PDFs: f rv (P 101 P).

32.4.1 The operator product expansion 
------------------------------~-----------------------------
The operator product expansion is the position-space version of the low-energy expan_ 
sion used to derive effective Lagrangians. The operators in an effective Lagrangian are 
composite operators, where fields are taken at the same point. For example, recall how the 
4-Fermi theory approximates the theory of weak interactions (see Chapters 22, 29 and 31). 
If we integrate out the TiV boson at tree-level we end up with a non-local Lagrangian:

The operator product expansion (OPE) writes products of local operators evaluated at 
different points, in the limit that the points approach each other, as a sum over composite 
local operators. Let all possible operators in the theory be denoted by On. Then the OPE 
says that 
lim 01(X)02(Y) = ~ 
Cn(x - y) On(x) 
x -------+y 
L....t 
(32.72) 
n 
for any two operators 0 1 and O2 . The reason the OPE is powerful is because the expansion 
holds at the level of operators. That is, the Wilson coefficients Cn are just numbers, inde-
pendent of the external state. Thus, the Cn can be computed once and for all in perturbation 
theory and can then be used for any process. Moreover, to compute the Cn one just needs 
to evaluate any matrix element sensitive to them, then one determines the Cn relevant for 
all matrix elements. 
For example, the 4-Fermi theory comes from the expansion of two weak currents 
JI-'(x) = 1}(x)ryI-''Ij!(x) and JI-'(y) = 1}(y)ryI-''Ij!(y) approaching each other. We performed 
the I-loop OPE through matching to the 4-Fermi theory in Section 31.3. In the 4-Fenni 
case, as in other perturbative effective field theories, only a finite number of operators are 
relevant for a given precision. In the case of DIS, we will see that an infinite number of 
operators are important (the twist-2 operators, defined below) but the OPE will still be 
useful. 

32.4 Factorization and the parton model from QeD 
Intuitively, the existence of an OPE makes perfect sense: long-distance physics should 
be independent of short-distance physics. This is resoundingly true in many other contexts: 
Newton's laws are independent of quantum mechanics, chemistry is independent of nuclear 
physics, etc. That is, the OPE should work for the same reason effective field theories work: 
physics naturally compartmentalizes itself so that all irrelevant scales can be taken to be 
either 0 or 00 without strongly affecting the physics in which we are interested. Despite 
the fact that the OPE is physically sensible, a rigorous mathematical proof is still lacking. 
A practical form of the OPE is 
J 
d4x eiqxO(x)O(O) = L Cn(q)On(O), 
n 
(32.73) 
with the Wilson coefficients in momentum space and the operators in position space. We 
usually calculate the OPE by evaluating Cn(q). 
32.4.2 Products of currents 
To apply the OPE to DIS we first want to express WILV in terms of matrix elements of the 
electromagnetic current constructed from quarks. Treating the quark charge as Q = 1 for 
simplicity, this current is JIL (x) = ~(x )r1L1jJ(X) , with 1jJ(x) the quark field. You may recall 
from Eq. (14.152) that S-matrix elements for photons, which have the photon propagator 
amputated by LSZ, are equal to matrix elements of the current JIL to which the photon 
couples. This equivalence follows because in pure quark states with spinors Ul (p) and 
U2 (pi) with momentum p and pi, the current has matrix element 
(32.74) 
To check this equation, simply plug in the expression for JIL (x) as a product of the quantum 
quark fields in terms of creation and annihilation operators. Thus, a shorthand for the spinor 
product U2 (pl)rILUl (p) coming out of a Feynman diagram matrix element calculation is 
just the current matrix element at x = 0: (pIIJIL(O)lp). 
For DIS, ,*p+ ---7 X, we need the matrix element of this current (since that is what the 
photon couples to) at x = 0 between an initial proton state IP) and an arbitrary hadronic 
final state (X I. That is, we need 
(32.75) 
Comparing to Eq. (32.12) we see that 
WILV(w, Q) = L J 
dIIx(PIJIL(O)IX) (XIJv(O)IP)(2'71/54 (qlL + plL - p~) 
x 
= L J 
dIIx J 
d4xei(q+P-px)X(PIJIL (O)IX)(XIJv (0)IP). 
(32.76) 
x 
Here we write WILV as a function of the Lorentz invariants w = 
~ = 
2~~q > 1 and Q2 
(using w instead of Bjorken x avoids confusion with position). There is an implicit average 
over proton spins in T¥lLv. 
687 

688 
Quantum chromodynamics and the parton model 
----------------------------------------------------
We next simplify this using 
(P/JI"(O)/X) = (P/e-iP'XJI"(x)eiP.x /x) = e-i(P- px)'X (P/JI"(x)/X), 
where P is the momentum operator that generates translations. This gives 
W,LI/(w, Q) = L J 
dIIx J 
d4x eiq'X(P /JI-'(x) /X ) (X /J,AO)/P) 
X 
= J 
d4:r eiQ 'X(P/JI-'(x)J,/(O)/P). 
(32.77) 
(32.78) 
Having performed the sum over IX), we no longer have to think explicitly about what the 
final states are. Now we can focus on the product of two ClUTent operators. 
We would now like to use the Q --+ 00 limit (at fixed w) to expand the operator product 
JI-'(x)Jv(O) around xl-' = O. Unfortunately, there are two problem with uch an expan ion 
The first problem is that, while we know how to calculate matrix element of time-ordered 
products of fields at different points using Feynman rule. , we do not know how to cal ulate 
products that are not time ordered. The second problem is that large Q2 implies xl-'xl' -> 
o (see Problem 32.7), but it does not imply that xl" --+ O. In fact, the currents can be 
separated very far on the lightcone at large Q2. In momentum space, the problem is that We 
would like to Taylor expand in Q- 2. Since w = 
2~~q this limit implies w --+ O. However, 
kinematically P . q > ~ Q2, implying w > 1 (i.e. Bjorken x < 1), so a naive large 
Q2 expansion will take us out of the physical region. To solve this problem, we need to 
rearrange things so we can Taylor expand around w = O. 
To solve the first problem, we use the optical theorem to turn the product of currents into 
a time-ordered product. The optical theorem says that the total rate for 'Y* p+ --+ X is given 
by the imaginary part of the forward scattering rate 'Y*P+ --+ 1*P+' Using Egs. (32.12) 
and (24.11), we can write 
(32.79) 
where 
(32.80) 
TI-'v is called the forward Compton amplitude. It is a forward amplitude since the (off-
shell) photon and proton have the same momentum in the initial and final states. In terms 
of currents, we can write TI"/.I as 
(32.81) 
We have expressed a matrix element squared YVI"V ~ /Mb*p --+ X)/2 ~ /(T{J} )/2 as 
the imaginary part of a matrix element TI-'v ~ M b *p --+ 'Y*p) rv (T {J J}). 
It is conventional to expand TI-'v in terms of its own structure functions, as in (32.13), 
with a slightly different normalization: 
TI"V(w , Q) = TI ( - gl-'/.I + ql-'q/.l) + ~ 
(PI-' - p. q ql-' ) (pv - p. q qv) . (32.82) 
q2 
p. q 
q2

The DIS structure functions are then H'I = 2ImTI and H'2 = 4Imw~2 T2 . It is al~o 
conventional to use the form factors FI ,2 in Eg. (32.26) for the factorization analysis 10 

32.4 Factorization and the parton model from QeD 
which F 1,2 = 
2~Im(Tl,2)' Thus, we expect ImT2 = 21f Li QrXfi(X) at leading order, 
which will allow us to match to the parton model, once T2 is calculated. 
Writing the hadronic tensor in terms of a time-ordered product solves the first problem 
since it lets us use Feynman rules to calculate the operator product. But it does not change 
the fact that Q2 ---> 00 does not imply xl" ---> 0, and thus we cannot justify a small xl" 
expansion. Fortunately, although we cannot justify a small xl" expansion in general, we 
will be able to justify it in certain cases. In particular, we will be able to justify it when we 
integrate over w. 
To see how an integration over w works, recall first, from Section 24.1.2, that the imagi-
nary part of TI"V can only come from on-shell intermediate states IX) (these are, of course, 
the same physical states contributing to WI"V). Since w is real and greater than 1 in the 
physical region, it is helpful to analytically continue to the complex w plane at fixed Q2. 
At fixed Q2 > 0, Tl"v is an analyticfunction of w except for when (P ± q) 2 = Q2 (1 ± w) 
is the mass of a physical on-shell state IX).2 Therefore TI"V(w, Q) has branch cuts on the 
real w axis, with w > 1 (the physical region) or w < -1 (an unphysical region3). Then we 
can use that the imaginary part of a function with a cut is given by the discontinuity across 
the cut: 
WIlV(w, Q) = 2ImTl"v(w, Q) = - iTl"v(w + ie, Q) + iTl"v(w - ie, Q) = Disc( - iTl"v), 
(32.83) 
with Disc standing for discontinuity (see Section 24.1.2). You should check this equation 
yourself (Problem 32.8). TVllv is sometimes called the absorptive part of Tl"v, 
Now, suppose we integrate over 1 ~ w < 00, which con'esponds to integrating Bjorken 
x from 0 to 1. Such an integral according to Eq. (32.83) can be performed in the complex 
plane above and below the cut. Since Tl"v is analytic away from the real axis, we can 
deform this contour to be around w = 0, as shown in Figure 32.4. Thus, we only need 
to know Tllv(w, Q) near w = 0 and we can justify Taylor expanding at small w. In other 
words, we can justify using the OPE of JIl(X)JV(O) as Xll ---> 0 to derive results about 
TVllv as long as we integrate over all w. 
32.4.3 Operator product expansion for DIS 
Now let us apply the OPE to DIS. We want to write 
T{JI"(x)J"(y)} = 2:= Cn(x -
y)O~V(x). 
(32.84) 
n 
What we will do is first calculate the OPE for quark external states. Then, since the OPE 
applies at the level of operators, independent of external states, we will apply the OPE in 
proton external states to get a definition of the PDFs. 
2 While it is true that T!'v is analytic away from the real axis, it is not easy to show. The proof uses that 
TJ.Lv is a two-point function in an essential way [Sterman, 1993]. One difficulty in proving factorization for 
processes where the final state is not inclusive over all hadrons is that the analytic structure of general scattering 
amplitudes can be incredibly complicated. 
3 The on-shell states for -00 < w < 1 cut are not physical for DIS. Since w -> -w corresponds to P -> -P, 
this cut corresponds to deep inelastic scattering of electrons off antiprotons.

Note that this is a forward scattering amplitude, so the quark has the same momentum pI" 
in both the initial and the final state. 
Let us first concentrate on the p + q term. To calculate the OPE coefficients, at leading 
order, we expand the denominator in Eg. (32.85) for Q2 » p2. (This is the equivalent of 
expanding ~ 
for m?v » p2 to generate the 4-Fermi theory.) The expansion of the

with the ... representing the second term in Eq. (32.85). 
Whenever we have such a momentum-space expan ion, we can read off the Wil on 
coefficients and operators in the OPE. For the OPE to make en e, aU fact r of pi.! should 
come from factors of i81l in the operators evaluated on extemaJ slates (which depend all 
pll). On the other hand, all dependence on th short-di 'lance cale qll (and Q2 = _ q2) 

32.4 Factorization and the parton model from QeD 
must be in the Wilson coefficients. For example, a term (~) n in such an expansion would 
come from an operator On = '0on1jJ with Wilson coefficient Cn = q3.,.. A term (~.;y ~22 
would come from On = '081-'181-' 2 81'3 01jJ with a Wilson coefficient Cn = Js ql-'l ql-'2 ql'3 , 
and so on. For Eq. (32.87), the Wilson operators are messy, and so we will simplify before 
reading off the OPE. 
So far, we have not made any approximations. We want to evaluate the OPE in proton 
external states, using the operators and Wilson coefficients calculated in quark external 
states. In the DIS limit, Q ----+ (Xl at fixed w, we can drop terms in the operators that will 
give contributions proportional to powers of A'QCD . In the proton, pll is replaced by some 
component of the proton momentum pi" = ~ pI-', so that p2 = e p2 = ~2 m; :S A~CD' 
We do not need to know exactly what pI' is, but we do need to know that it has no access 
to Q. Terms such as O/Q2 in operators give factors of p2 /Q2 that are small. Thus, we can 
take the p2 / Q2 ----+ 0 limit in Eq. (32.87) to extract simplified operators. On the other hand, 
terms such as 81" /Q in operators then give factors of q . p/Q2 ~ w that are not small (we 
will be integrating over w). Thus we only need to keep terms with 81-'. 
We can also simplify the Dirac structure in Eg. (32.87). Since the final result must be 
symmetric in JL <C--+ 1/, we can symmetrize and use the relation 
, '1-' (1 + «)Iv + "t (1 + «hI-' = 2,I-'(pV + qV) + 2~fV (pI-' + ql-') -
2gl-'V (1 + «) . 
(32.88) 
The 1 term acting on quark states gives mq = O. Acting on proton states using 1 = Uf it 
gives ~mp « Q, so it can be dropped there as well. 
The second term in Eq. (32.85) gives the same OPE as the first with q ----+ -q. Therefore, 
we can drop terms odd in q and double the ones even in q. Thus we can write 
(32.89) 
up to terms that give AQD -suppressed contributions in proton external states. Note that all 
of the terms in the series have one ~r-matrix in them. All pI-' terms should come from deriva-
tives in operators in the OPE (through the replacement PI-' ----+ i81J and all ql-' terms should 
be in the Wilson coefficients. For example, the first line in Eq. (32.89) is reproduced by 
(32.90)

2 2n 
C~~'2'l-'n(q) = Q2 Q2n ql-'1 ... qlLn. 
(32.91) 
The second line in Eg. (32.91) decomposes similarly. 
It is standard to work in a basis of gauge-invariant operators that transform in irreducible 
representations of the Lorentz group. An operator of spin s will be a symmetric, traceless

This has gl-'vO~,~ = O. It differs from the O~v in Eq. (32.90) by a scalar operator 1j;(/J1jJ. 
That is, 
(32.93) 
The basis of spin-s operators is 
O~Y'I-'s = i/nl-'l iBM . .. iOl-'s( -Or 1/J + symmetrizations of f.Li -
traces. 
(32.94) 
These operators have mass dimension d = 2 + s + 27". Knowing the dimension and the 
spin fixes t == 2 + 27" = d - s. This quantity t is known as the twist of an operator. That is, 
twist = dimension - spin. Since the operators with extra 0 factors are suppressed, the OPE 
will be dominated by operators with the lowest twist. These are operators such as 8~,~ in 
Eq. (32.92), which is dimension 4 and spin 2 and hence has twist 2. In general, promoting 
the derivatives to covariant derivatives and adding a label for the quark flavor, we define 
O~""I-'n(x) = ?jjq (X)JI-'l iDI-'2 ... iDl-'n 1/Jq (x) + symmetrizations of f.Li - traces. (32.95) 
This is the canonical basis of gauge-invariant twist-2 quark operators. 
There are no gauge-invariant operators in QCD with twist less than 2. To see that, first 
note that gauge-invariant operators must have at least two quark fields or two gluon field 
strengths FI-'v, Adding more fields adds to the dimension and hence to the twist. Without 
derivatives, two quarks have dimension 3 and can only have spin 0 or 1; hence quark 
operators have at least twist 2. Derivatives add I to the dimension and at most 1 to the spin 
and hence cannot lower twist below 2. For gluons, F;v has dimension 4 and spin at most 
2. Thus, gluonic operators also have t 2: 2. Explicitly, the twist-2 gluon operators are

" I-'n = FI-'1ViDI-'2 ... iDl-'n-l Fl-'n U + symmetrizations of f.Li - traces. 
(32.96) 
The Wilson coefficients for these operators are zero at leading order. 
All gauge-invariant operators in QCD with twist higher than 2 are generically called 
higher twist. It is common to think of twist-2 operators as synonymous with the large Q2, 
fixed x limit, and higher twist operators as providing power corrections. 
In summary, after a bit of algebra and restoring quark charges, the OPE can be written 
in terms of twist-2 operators as (see [Manohar, 2003, Section 1.8])

This OPE is valid to leading power in A3~D and at leading order in O:s. 

32.4 Factorization and the parton model from QeD 
To use the OPE to calculate the time-ordered hadronic tensor TMV for DIS, we need to 
take the matrix element of this OPE in a proton state. By Lorentz invariance, all we can get 
after summing over proton spins is 
L)pI8~1 " Pn IP ) = A~pM l ... PM" - traces, 
(32.98) 
spins 
with A~ functions of Q. This expression is automatically symmetric. The traces give fac-
tors of p 2 = m~ « Q2 which are subleading compared to contractions of pM; with qM 
from the Wilson coefficients, which give factors of q . P = ~wQ2. Thus, we can drop the 
traces at leading power and we find 
Comparing to Eq. (32.82) we conclude that 
(32.100) 
In particular, since F1 = 
2~ ImT1 and F2 
2~ ImT2 we reproduce the Callan-Gross 
relation F1 = '4fF2 . More importantly, since F1 = ~ I:q Q~h( x) in the parton model, we 
find 
(32.101) 
This gives an operator definition of the PDFs in QCD. 
One consequence of this way of defining the PDFs is that it lets us calculate the PDF 
evolution from the RG evolution of the twist-2 operators. Beyond leading order, amplitudes 
An are divergent and thus the operators On must be renormalized. The RG evolution of the 
operators is compensated for by RG evolution of the Wilson coefficients, as discussed in 
Chapter 23. It is a straightforward exercise to work out the anomalous dimensions for the 
quark and gluon twist-2 operators. As in the example in Section 3l.3, there will be oper-
ator mixing. The result of the calculation is that the I-L dependence of the PDFs defined 
through operator matrix elements exactly agrees with the Altarelli-Parisi evolution, as 
derived in the parton model. The details of the calculation are clearly explained in [Peskin 
and Schroeder, 1995, Chapter 18].

32.4.4 Moments of the PDFs 
----------------------------------------------------------
With an operator definition of the PDFs, we can now check that the PDFs satisfy the 
sum rules from Section 32.1.4 that we deduced with physical arguments. For example 
J dxfq (x) should give the total number of valence quarks of a particular species. 
' 
The sum rules are generally of the form of integrals of xm times the PDFs: 
(32.102) 
This is known as a Mellin moment. Plugging in Eq. (32.101) we find 
(32.103) 
Writing the imaginary part as a discontinuity and deforming the contour to a small circle 
around the origin, as in Figure 32.4, we have 
(32.104) 
Thus, the An are precisely the Mellin moments of the PDFs. It is these moments that are 
rigorously defined by the OPE in DIS. 
Two important special cases are m = 2 and m = 1. For m = 2, the relevant twist-2 
operator is 
(32.105) 
This is a symmetrized version of the canonical energy-momentum tensor for a quark, which 
we derived in Eq. (12.62). The full energy-momentum tensor in QeD is a sum over the 
quark (and gluon) energy-momentum tensors. Thus, we can evaluate this sum in a proton 
state to get twice the proton's energy-momentum: 
L(PI8jVIP) = pI"PV, 
(32.106) 
J 
where the sum is over all partons (not just quarks). Using Eq. (32.102) with m = 2 and 
Eq. (32.98) we then find 
(32.107) 
The operator analy j therefore gives aju, tineation to the interpretation lbat I da; x/j(x) ==

32.5 Lightcone coordinates 
32.4.5 Summary 
In this section we have given a field theory definition of the parton distribution functions. 
We wrote the hadronic tensor Hff.LV for deep inelastic scattering in terms of expectation 
values oftwist-2 operators: An rv (PlonIP). Matching to the parton-model picture, these 
An can be identified with Mellin moments of the PDFs. This approach allows us to prove 
certain features of PDFs, such as their sum rules, that can only be justified semi-classically 
using the parton model. Although the An are non-perturbative, their scale dependence can 
be calculated in perturbation theory. Thus, one can predict logarithmic Q2 dependence 
of the DIS structure functions and calculable cOlTections to Bjorken scaling. The scaling 
violation is the same as we found with the DGLAP equations, but with this method, we did 
not have to assume the parton model. 
Although we have defined the PDFs for DIS non-perturbatively in terms of Wf.LV, this 
definition is not tremendously useful for processes other than DIS. What we would like to 
do is show that any process involving high-energy scattering of protons can be written as 
(J = H 0 j, with H a calculable hard function and j the same universal PDFs. For the DIS 
case, we simply defined j in terms of the non-perturbative hadronic form factor Wf.Lv . This 
is called the DIS PDF scheme. In this scheme, H is defined to be 1 to all orders, and the 
only prediction one can make is the scale dependence of the PDFs (or differences between 
form factors). In global PDF fits, this scheme is not used; instead theMS scheme is used, 
where only the ~ poles are absorbed into the PDFs. Changing schemes of course does not 
make our calculations any more predictive for DIS. 
32.5 Lightcone coordinates 
The proof of factorization above using the OPE relied on being able to perform a Taylor 
expansion at large Q2 in which we could drop subleading terms. There is another way to 
set up the DIS calculation so that subleading terms can be dropped, which leads to an alter-
native way to think about PDFs: as lightcone projections of proton matrix elements. This 
approach, while somewhat less rigorous than the OPE, is more friendly to more general 
factorization arguments. 
In the parton model, the PDFs j (~) are interpreted as the probability to find a parton 
inside the proton with momentum pf.L = ~Pf.L (we use ~ instead of x to avoid confusion 
with xf.L). We know what probabilities are in quantum mechanics (or quantum field theory): 
they are matrix elements squared. Thus, we should be able to write 
j(~) = L I(XI1jJIP)1 2 
J(~Pf.L - pf.L) = 
(pl 1jJt1jJl p )J(~p f.L - pf.L) , 
(32.108) 
X 
with pf.L the quark momentum as before. This is almost right, since 1jJ t 1jJ = i{!,o1jJ is the 
quark-number density (the zero component of the quark-number current Jf.L = i{!,f.L1jJ). 
However, it is not quite right, since the parton's momentum does not have to be exactly 
proportional to the proton momentum. The momenta only have to be proportional up to 
695

Quantum chromodynamics and the parton model 
....... ------------------------------------------------
some small transverse fluctuations. That is, we expect the component of pI" in the proton's 
direction to be ~PI", and the other components are small, ~9f. Obviously, the proton's 
direction has no meaning in the proton rest frame. The natural frame for this discussion is 
rather the center-of-mass frame. At hadron-hadron colliders, such as the LHC, the center_ 
of-mass frame is the lab frame, but for fixed target experiments (such as typical e- p-t-
experiments), it is not. So we will first change frames for DIS, then return to Eq. (32.108). 
The center-of-mass frame for ,*p -t X is known as the Breit frame. In this frame, the 
photon and proton momenta are 
ql" = (0,0,0, Q) , 
PI" = (Q, 0, 0, -Q). 
(32.109) 
Since ql" = kl" -
k~, the incoming and outgoing electron momenta must be 
k' = (~, 0, 0, - ~) , 
(32.110) 
so that the electron bounces right off the proton, as if it hit a brick wall. Hence, the Breit 
frame is sometimes refened to with the mnemonic brick wall frame. 
Now consider some parton in the proton with momentum pl". Its momentum should be 
collinear with the proton's momentum, pI" = ~PI", up to some transverse component PT. 
When we boost from the proton rest frame to the Breit frame, PT does not change, thus 
we expect PT rv mp « Q. A clean way to think about which momentum components are 
small at large Q is using lightcone coordinates. Let nl" be any light like 4-vector, that is, 
n2 = 0, and normalized such that nl" = (1, ii). For DIS, we can take nl" = (1,0, 0,1), 
which is backwards to the proton direction. Define the backwards direction to nl" as flP = 
(1, -ii), so that n . fi = 2. For DIS in the Breit frame, fil" = (1,0,0, -1) is the proton's 
direction. In general, any momentum kl" can be decomposed as 
1 
1 
kl" == 2" (fi . k) nl" + 2" (n . k) fil" + k~ 
(32.111) 
with kT . n = kT . fi = 0. k~ is the part of kl" in the transverse (x and y) directions. This 
can be checked by contracting with nl" or fil". We also find 
k2 = (n . k) (fi . k) + k~. 
(32.112) 
With this notation, we can interpret the momentum fraction ~ of the parton inside the proton 
to be the component of the momentum in the n direction. That is, n . p = ~ (n . P). The 
fi . p and PT components of the parton momentum are much smaller. That is, ijt:1P ~ O. 
Now that we are in a frame where the proton is very energetic, we can make Eq. (32.108) 
precise. We write 
f(~) = L J 
dIIx l(XI 'ljJ IP ) 1 2o(~n· P - n· p). 
x 
(32.113) 
This is the probability of finding a quark within a proton with a given momentum fraction. 
To be clear, in this equation, there is no scattering. Rather, it describes how the proton 
momentum splits up into pI" = pI" + p~, where pI" is the momentum of the parton and p~ 

32.5 Ughtcone coordinates 
is the momentum of everything else in the proton. Inserting a factor of j'd4p r54.(P-p - px) 
we find 
1(0 = J

We can simplify this further by noting that since the quark is going mostly in the n,fL 
direction fi,1)! ;::::; O. This implies "y01)! = - (n ,1) '1/) and so 2,°1)! = rA1)!. Then, 
(32.115) 
To make this gauge invariant, we can insert a Wilson line (see Section 25.2) stretching 
between the points x = 0 and x M = tn M where the quark fields are evaluated: 
(32.116) 
Thus, we arrive at 
(32.117) 
To be clear, n M = (1, n) is a Jightlike 4-vector pointing opposite to the direction of the 
proton's momentum. You can check in Problem 32.11 that moments of the PDFs defined 
this way reproduce matrix elements of twist-2 operators from Section 32.4.4. 
The advantage of an expression such as Eq. (32.117) is that it appears generically in 
high-energy processes in a frame where the proton is ultra-relativistic, such as the lab frame 
in hadron-hadron collisions. Similar analyses can therefore be done for other processes, 
such as Drell-Yan, direct photon production (pp --> ~, + X), dijet production, etc. Each 
of these has a scale Q (the invariant mass of the lepton pair in Drell- Yan, the transverse 
momentum of the photon, or the invariant mass of the dijet system). When Q » m p , by 
considering how the relevant momenta scale with Q (such as PM, pM and qM for DIS) one 
can often write down factorization formulas for cross sections using lightcone PDFs. If 
one is content with scaling arguments as a proof of these factorization formulas, then it is 
possible to have a tremendous amount of predictive power without an OPE.

ADVANCED TOPICS 


Effective actions and Schwinger 
proper time 
We have mentioned effective actions a few times already. For example, the effective action 
for the 4-Fermi theory is derived from the Standard Model by integrating out the Wand Z 
bosons. It is an effective action since it is valid only in some regime, in this case for energies 
less than mw. More generally, an effective action is one that gives the same results as a 
given action but has different degrees of freedom. For the 4-Fermi theory, the effective 
action does not have the VV and Z bosons. In this chapter we will develop powerful tools to 
calculate effective actions more generally. We will discuss three ways to calculate effective 
actions: through matching (or the operator product expansion), through field-dependent 
expectation values using Schwinger proper time, and with functional determinants coming 
from Feynman path integrals. 
The first step is to define what we mean by an effective action. The term effective action, 
denoted by r, generally refers to a functional of fields (like any action) defined to give the 
same Green's functions and S-matrix elements as a given action S, which is often called the 
action for the full theory. We write r = J d4x .ceff (x), where .ceff is called the effective 
Lagrangian. Differences between rand S include that r often has fewer fields, is non-
renormalizable, and only has a limited range of validity. When a field is in the full theory 
but not in the effective action, we say it has been integrated out. 
The advantage of using effective actions over full theory actions is that by focusing only 
on the relevant degrees of freedom for a given problem calculations are often easier. For 
example, in Section 31.3 we saw that in the 4-Fermi theory large logarithmic corrections 
to b -> cdu decays of the form a ~ Inn m W could be summed to all orders in perturbation 
mb 
theory. The analogous calculation in the full Standard Model would have been a nightmare. 
The effective action we will focus on for the majority of this chapter is the one arising 
from integrating out a fermion of mass m in QED. We can define this effective action 
r[A,J by 
J 
DAexp(ir[AI"D == J 
DA Dif; D1f; exp [i J 
d
4x ( -~ FI"t! + if; (iJ,V - m)1f; ) ] . 
(33.1) 
When AI" corresponds to a constant electromagnetic field, L eff [A] is called the Euler-
Heisenberg Lagrangian. The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian is amazing: it gives us the 
QED /3-function, Schwinger pair creation, scalar and pseudoscalar decay rates, the chiral 
anomaly, and the low-energy limit for scatteling n photons, including the light-by-
light scattering cross section. As we will see, the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian can be 
calculated to all orders in a e using techniques from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. 
703 

704 
Effective actions and Schwinger proper time 
c--==-~ -----------------------------------------------___ 
33.1 Effective actions from matching 
So far, we have only discussed how effective actions can be calculated through matching. 
This approach requires that matrix elements of states agree in the full and effective theories. 
For example, in the 4-Fermi theory, we asked that 
(33.2) 
where the subscript on the correlation function indicates the action used to calculate it. 
Writing the effective Lagrangian as a sum over operators Leff(X) = L CiOi(X) we were 
able to determine the Wilson coefficients Ci by asking that Eq. (33.2) hold order-by-order 
in perturbation theory. One-loop matching in the 4-Fermi theory was discussed in Sec-
tion 31.3. Other examples of matching that we considered include the Chiral Lagrangian 
(Section 28.2.2) and deep inelastic scattering (Section 32.4). 
In the 4-Fermi theory and for deep inelastic scattering, we matched by expanding prop-
agators pL1m:l 
Or p~~Q2 re pectively (see Eqs. (32.70) and (32.7 J ». The reason one can 
expand propagators t derive an effective Lagrangian is becau, e when a scale such a mw 
or Q is taken large the propagator can only propagate over a mall distance. In term of 
Feynman diagrams, we expand an exchange graph in a et of local interaction : 
(33.3) 
To see how this works in position space, consider matching a Yukawa theory with a massive 
scalar, 
(33.4) 
to an effective Lagrangian Leff which lacks that scalar and is useful for energies much 
less than m. For large m, fluctuations of ¢ around its classical configuration are highly 
suppressed. Thus, to leading order we can assume ¢ satisfies its classical equations of 
motion, ¢ = D+"m2 ijJ'Ij;, and that loops of ¢ are small corrections. Plugging the classical 
solution back into the Lagrangian gives 
(33.5) 
In this way Leff is guaranteed to give the same correlation functions as Ly but has no ¢ 
field in it. As long as m is larger than typical momentum scales, we can also Taylor expand 
this non-local effective Lagrangian in a series of local operators: 
(33.6) 
If ¢ were the VV and Z, this would give the 4-Ferrni theory supplemented by additional 
operators that have effects suppressed by powers of ~ 
at low energy. 
mw 

33.2 Effective actions from Schwinger proper time 
Setting ¢ to its classical equations of motion amounts to taking the steepest descent 
approximation in the path integral. To integrate out ¢ to all orders, we have to perfOlm the 
path integral exactly. Thus, we can define the effective action as 
J 
D1f; D1f; exp(i J 
d4x Leff[1f;, 1f;l) = J 
D¢D1f;D1f; exp(i J 
d4XLy[¢,1f;,1f;l), 
(33.7) 
which connects back to the definition given in Eq. (33.1). 
33.2 Effective actions from Schwinger 
proper time 
The next method we discuss for computing effective actions is through Schwinger proper 
time. The idea here is to evaluate the propagator for the particle we want to integrate out 
as a functional of the other fields. Pictorially, we can write this as 
+ 
+ 
+ .... 
(33.8) 
Then, when we integrate out the field, we will generate an infinite set of interactions among 
the other fields. 
The key to Schwinger's proper-time formalism is the mathematical identity

An alternative to performing the integral over p dIrectly IS first to introduce a one-particle 
Hilbert space spanned by Ix), as in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This lets us write 
(pix) = e ipx . Then, from Eq. (33.10) we get

dse- Sce-iSm2(y;Olx;s), (33.13) 
where Ix; s) == e-iSH lx). In the second step, we have interpreted iI as a Hamiltonian and 
s as a time variable known as Schwinger proper time. I Schwinger proper time gives an 
intuitive interpretation of a propagator: 
A propagator is the amplitude for a particle to propagate from x to y in proper time s, 
integrated over s. 
One has to be careful interpreting iI howev,er, since it conventionally includes only the p 
dependence and not the m dependence (as H = m 2 - ii would). 
We can go even further into quantum mechanics by defining the Green's function as an 
operator matrix element. Define the Green's function operator for a massive scalar as

i 
G == p2 _ m2 + i€ .

which is a Feynman parameter integral. Thus, in a loop, each particle has its own proper 
time, s or t, which denote how long each particle has taken to get around its part of the 
loop. Then the Feynman parameter x = s~t is how far one particle is behind the other one. 
33.2.1 Background fields 
Now suppose a field ¢ interacts with a photon field, through the usual scalar QED 
Lagrangian: 
(33.19) 
with DJ.' = OJ.' + ieAJ.L' As a step towards calculating the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, 
we will need the scalar propagator in the presence of a fixed external AJ.' field. We write 
(AI, .. IA) instead of (DI ... ID) when matrix elements are taken in the presence of an 
external field rather than the vacuum. Thus, the propagator in the presence of an external 
field Af-L is written as 
GA(X,y) = (AIT{¢(y)¢*(x)}IA).

This equation illustrates an advantage of the quantum mechanics operator formalism over 
Feynman diagrams: we can work in position and momentum space at the same time, 
through operators such as p - eA(x). 
Then, as in Eq. (33.15), we have 
GA(x, y) = (yIGAlx) = (yl

(33.22) 
where now 
(33.23) 
So we get the same formula as for the free theory, but with a different Hamiltonian. The 
interpretation of Eq. (33.22) is that G A (x, y) describes the evolution of ¢ from x to y in 
time s, including all possible interactions with a field Af-L over all possible times s. This is 
shown diagrammatically in Eq. (33.8). 
For a spin or, we want to evaluate 
GA(X, y) = (AIT{1/;(y)'!jj(x)}I A).

(33.27) 
and so the Dirac propagator is 
as before, but now with 
(33.29) 
Note that there is no Dirac trace here, since the Green's function is a matrix in spinor space. 
33.2.2 Field-dependent expectation values 
To connect to effective actions, recall from Section 33.l that to integrate out a field at tree-
level we set it equal to its equations of motion. Another way to phrase this procedure is that 
we set the field equal to a configuration for which the Lagrangian has a minimum. Now, 
classically, we can always expect to find the field at the minimum. So the minimum can be 
thought of as a classical expectation. The generalization to the quantum theory is to replace 
a field by its quantum vacuum expectation value: 
(33.30) 
The classical and quantum expectation values agree at tree-level, but can be different when 
loops or non-perturbative effects are included. We will consider how the vacuum can be 
destabilized by quantum effects in Chapter 34. Our focus here is not on the expecta-
tion value in the vacuum, but in the presence of a fixed electromagnetic field. Thus, in 
a background field, we can integrate out ¢ by replacing ¢ --> (AI¢IA). 
Let us go straight to the fermion case. The Lagrangian is 
(33.31) 
We now want to replace this by the effective Lagrangian where the current that Ai-' cou-
ples to is replaced by its expectation value in the given fixed configuration, which we are 
denoting as Ai-': 
(33.32) 

33.2 Effective actions from Schwinger proper time 
where 
J~ == (AI?j)(xhJ.Lw(x)IA). 
(33.33) 
This is not a vacuum matrix element, but a matrix element in the presence of a given state 
IA). 
Now we can calculate J~ using Schwinger proper time. First note that A = 0 is the 
vacuum, so J(; should reduce to the propagator G(x, y) with x = y when the field is 
turned off. Indeed, being explicit about the spin indices 
J(;(x) = (nl7/)c>(xh~QWa(x)ln) = -Tr[(nIWQ(x)7/)c> (xh~j3ln)] == -Tr(x IGiJ.Llx) . 
(33.34) 
The third form is meant to indicate that the trace of the matrix [w7/)i J.L 1 
0:13 is being taken. 
In the presence of a non-zero A field, we just have to replace this by the propagator in the 
AJ.L background: 
(33.35) 
where G A is the Green's function in Eq. (33.27). So, 
J~ = -Tr [1

ds e-SCe-ism2 (XITr[iJ.L(P -
eJ)ei((p-eA)2-~lTl'vFI"V)s ] Ix) , 
(33.36) 
where we have used that Tr of an odd number of i-matrices is zero. Next, note that the 
current is itself a variation:

(33.37) 
Integrating both sides with respect to AJ.L and using Eq. (33.32) gives 
(33.38) 
which is only a function of the background field AI"' For a spinor, iI is given in Eq. (33.29). 
For a complex scalar, the effective Lagrangian has a similar form: 
(33.39) 
with iI 
-(p - eA(x))2 as in Eq. (33.23). The scalar case is actually more difficult 
to derive than the spinor case using Schwinger's method because of the A~¢*¢ term in 
the scalar QED Lagrangian. We produce this Lagrangian using Feynman path integrals in 
Eq. (33.52) below.

33.2.3 Interpretation and cross check 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to an extra [actor of ~ the proper-time integral in Eq. (33.38) look ju t like (xiC 
1\ Iv) 
in Eq. (33.22) with. ' = 1/. Thi i ea y to under tand: the effective action urns cl0 ed 
loops, where the particle propagates back LO where it started after orne proper time s. 
ThaI i • it is an integral vel' (Xj 01 ; ). In term 
f Peynman diagrams. the effective action 
includes all diagrams with any number of external photons and one closed fermion loop; 
(33.40) 
The physical interpretation of the expectation value (xl e-iHslx ) 
(x; Olx; s) in 
Eq. (33.38) is therefore that it is the amplitude for a particle to go around a loop in proper 
time s based on evolution with the Hamiltonian fI. 
Note that the first diagram in Eq. (33.40) does not involve any photons at all, thus it 
should represent the vacuum energy of the system. This provides a nice consistency check. 
Setting A = 0, to get just the first diagram, the effective action becomes (in the complex 
scalar case)

Inserting 1l = J (~:~4Ik)(kl we find 
(33.42) 
where VT is the volume of space-time. It is convenient to remove this factor by writing 
r [OJ = - (VT) Veff with Veff an effective potential energy density, which in this case is just 
a constant. 
The integral over proper time is divergent from the 8 rv 0 region, cOJTesponding to where 
the loop has zero proper length. However, Schwinger proper time conveniently gives us a 
Lorentz-invariant and gauge-invariant way to regulate such divergences: cut off the integral 
for 8 > So. To evaluate Veff , we Wick rotate ko -+ iko and can integrate over the imaginary 
axis. This gives

where we have replaced 8 -+ -is in the second step. Then we find 
(33.44) 

33.3 Effective actions from Feynman path integrals 
The - )so is a divergent constant, conesponding to an extlinsic cutoff-dependent vacuum 
energy. This can be removed with a vacuum energy counterterm. The important term is in 
the integral over Jk2 + m 2 = Wb which counts the ground-state energies of the modes. 
It was this sum, not the constant, that led to the Casimir force discussed in Chapter 15. 
Note that we get Wk instead of ~Wk since this is the effective action for a complex scalar 
that has twice the energy of a real scalar. For a Dirac fermion, the calculation is identical, 
since fI = _f;2 in both cases when A = O. The only difference is that the Dirac trace and 
-~ in Eq. (33.38) give a factor of 4( - ~) = -2 compared to the scalar case in Eq. (33.39). 
The minus sign is consistent with a fermion loop and the factor of 2 is consistent with a 
Dirac spinor having twice the number of degrees of freedom of a complex scalar. These 
are the same results we found in Section 12.5 by computing the energy density from the 
energy-momentum tensor. One consequence is that in a theory with a Weyl fermion and 
a complex scalar of the same mass, such as in theories with supersymmetry, the vacuum 
energy is zero. 
33.3 Effective actions from Feynman 
path integrals 
An alternative approach to calculating the effective action is based on the Feynman path 
integral. Here we want to integrate over some fields by performing the path integral. For 
scalar QED, integrating out the scalar means 
J 
VA exp(ir[A]) = J 
VAv¢v¢*exP[i J 
d4X(-~F~v - ¢*(D2 + m2)¢)] . 
(33.45) 
In this case, since the original action is quadratic in ¢, we can evaluate the path integral 
exactly. We will ignore the if'. in this section for simplicity. 
Recall the general formula from Problem 14.1: 
(33.46) 
where N is some (infinite) normalization constant. Thus, for the scalar QED Lagrangian 
we find 
This equation will be satisfied if 
(33.48)

Effective actions and Schwinger proper time

To make this notation somewhat less opaque, we can turn this mysterious determinant into 
a sum by noting that 
ir[A] + i J 
d4X~F~v -InN = -In[det(-D2 - m 2 )] = - tr[In(-D2 - m 2 )]. 
(33.49) 
The trace is a sum over eigenvalues, in this case, eigenvalues of -In( - D2 - m 2 ). One 
can either evaluate this trace in momentum space, as will be discussed in Chapter 34, Or 
in position space, as we discuss here. The beautiful thing about a trace is that it is basis 
independent. So we can just evaluate the sum on position eigenstates. That is, using the 
quantum mechanics notation from Section 33.2 we have

these constants, and indeed we will exploit the fact that L eff can be shifted by a constant to 
remove infinities when L eff is renormalized. 
33.3.1 Fermions 
For fermions, we need to evaluate 
(33.53) 
Thus, 
ir[A] = i J 
d4x ( -~Fi-'v) + Tr[tr(In(ilP - m))] + const, 
(33.54) 
where Tr indicates a Dirac trace and tr is the normal integral over xi-' or pi-'. The effective 
Lagrangian is then

Leff(X) = - ~F;:1/ + i ( 00 ds e-iSm2Tl·[(xle-i.$2slx)] + const.

Another way to obtain this result is to observe that 
Tr(xlln(iI/J - m) Ix) = Tr(xlln( -iI/J - m) I.T) . 
So averaging the two gives 
122 
Tl'(xlIn(iI/J - m)lx) = "2Tr(xlln(- I/J - m) Ix). 
We can write this in terms of Schwinger parameters using the identity

which holds as So ---+ O. This lets us write Eq. (33.54) with Eq. (33.60) as Eq. (33.58). 
33.4 Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian 
Now we are ready to do some physics! We will calculate the effective action for the case of 
a constant background electromagnetic field F1w (which is not the same as constant AfL)' 
From Eq. (33.38) we need to evaluate (xle- iHs Ix), where H = -(j)- eA(x) )2+ ~a fLvFfLV 
in the spinor case and H = - (j) + eA(x))2 for scalars. There are a number of ways to 
evaluate this trace. The quickest way is to work in basis l'ljin) of eigenstates of H. Then we

Effective actions and Schwinger proper time 
c===~. ----------------------------------------------____ 
Thus, we just have to sum e-iE"s over all the eigenvalues En of iI. In this way, We 
reduce the problem to non-relativistic quantum mechanics. An alternative, somewhat more 
general, approach is discussed in Appendix 33.A. 
We are interested in constant Filv ' For a constant magnetic field in the z direction, We 
can take Ay = Bx and so the Hamiltonian becomes 
(33.63) 
with the eB(Y z term being the spin-magnetic moment interaction coming from (Y IlvFILU 
iI has eigenstates for any values of Pt) Py and pz. Writing 
. 
(33.64) 
reduces the problem to finding the eigenstates of p~ + (eBx)2 , which is just the non-
relativistic harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The result is that Xn are the harmonic 
oscillator wavefunctions and n takes discrete values, corresponding to the Landan levels 
of a non-relativistic electron in a magnetic field. The energies are therefore 
(33.65) 
where,\ = ± ~ comes from spin being up or down in the z direction. 
Thus we need to evaluate

In this form, the Lagrangian is more obviously real (except possibly near singularities as 
discussed in Section 33.4.3). 
Finally, the Lagrangian should be renormalized. We use minimal subtraction. Expanding 
the integrand perturbatively in e, we find 
Recosh(esX)

The leading two terms result in a UV divergence from the small proper-time region of the 
d8 integral. These divergences can be regulated in a Lorentz-invariant and gauge-invariant 
way by simply cutting off 8 > 80. The required counterterms are a constant and a renormal-
ization of the leading F~I/ term. Thus, we remove the infinities with minimal subtraction, 
giving 
This is the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. It is the renormalized effective action aris-
ing from integrating out a massive fermion for constant Ff-LI/' It is worth emphasizing that 
this effective Lagrangian is non-perturbative in e. It encodes an infinite number of I-loop 
diagrams, as in Eq. (33.40), and a tremendous amount of physics. We will go through a 
number of applications below. 
In Appendix 33.A, we derive this Lagrangian more slowly, using Schwinger's original 
method. The basic idea is to calculate (Yi e- iHs ix) = (y; Oix; 8) by solving the differential 
equation 
ios(Y; Oix; 8) = iDs (y; Oie- iHsix; 0) = (y; OiHix; 8). 
(33.74) 
The Heisenberg equations of motion isH"' = i [H, xl-' ] ~nd dd,pf-L = i [H ,pf-L] are used to 
get an explicit form for xf-L (,,) and pI-' (8) and therefore H (8). This method of calculation 
produces the full Green's function G(x, y) = (y; Oix; 8) , which is more generally useful 
715

Effective actions and Schwinger proper time 
....... ---------------------------------------------------
than the effective action alone. For x = y, which is relevant for the effective action, the 
differential equation reduces to (cf. Eq. (33.A.149)): 
- iOs(x; Olx; s) = tr [~eFcoth(eSF) + ~(J'F] (x; Olx; s), 
(33.75) 
where F = 
FfJ.v and (J' = 
(J fJ.V are matrices. The solution with appropriate boundary

(33.76) 
Again, this can be checked by differentiation. For a constant magnetic field, this is 
equivalent to Eq. (33.67). 
The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian was first calculated by Heisenberg and his student 
Hans Euler by finding exact solutions to the Dirac equation in a constant Fl'v background 
[Euler and Heisenberg, 1936]. Our derivation of it, particularly the one in Appendix 33.A, 
is due to Schwinger [Schwinger, 1951]. 
33.4.1 Vacuum polarization 
Expanding the unrenormalized Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, as in Eq. (33.72), we found 
two divergent terms which were removed with counterterms in Eq. (33.73). If we do not 
include these counterterms, the expansion gives 
(33.77) 
The first term in brackets is constant. It gives the vacuum energy density, as discussed in 
Section 33.2.3. The second term looks just like the tree-level QED kinetic term, -
~ F~v' 
Keeping only this term (before renormalization), we have 
(33.78) 
This is UV divergent, from the s rv 0 region. Regulating with a Lorentz-invariant UV

This logarithmic dependence on the cutoff is exactly what we found from computing the 
full vacuum polarization graph in QED. As discussed in Chapter 23, UV divergences deter-
mine RGEs, and this one determines the leading order ,B-function coefficient. We can read 

33.4 Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian 
off from the coefficient of the logarithm in Eq. (33.79) (as discussed in Chapter 23), that 
the ,B-function in QED at I-loop is 
e3 
,B(e) = 121r2 , 
which agrees with Eq. (16.73) (or Eq. (23.29)). 
33.4.2 Light-by-light scattering 
(33.80) 
The original motivation of Heisenberg and Euler was to calculate the rate for photons to 
scatter off other photons. This problem was suggested to them by Otto Halpern and is 
sometimes called Halpern scattering. The relevant Feynman diagram is 
P3 
iM= 
(33.81) 
This is a difficult loop to compute directly, even with today's technology, much less with 
what Euler and Heisenberg knew in 1936. We can get the answer (in the limit of low-
frequency light w « m) directly from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. The relevant 
term is the one to fourth order in e, which has the form ~~ ~4 [(F2)2 + i (F F)2] . This 
term was computed first in a paper by Euler and Kockel [Euler and Kockel, 1935]. Using 
it for light-by-light scattering conesponds to a tree-level Feynman diagram of the form 
iM = 
(33.82) 
Note that our effective Lagrangian is only valid when o!"Fa(3 = 0; thus we will only get 
2 
the result to leading order in ~. From the experimental point of view, this is enough, since 
light-by-light scattering of real on-shell photons has not yet been experimentally observed, 
at any frequency.

33.4.3 Schwinger pair production 
Notice that the effective Lagrangian in Eq. (33.73) has singularities for certain values of 
the electromagnetic field. To see where the singularities are, we first consider the case with 
13 and £ parallel. Then, 
F;v = 2(132 - E2) = 2(B2 - E 2) , 
where E = lEI and B = 1131, and 
FJwF/-,v = 4£ ·13 = 4EB,

Since coth(x) has no poles for x > 0, the singularities are all associated with constant

In this form, we can see that the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian has poles for real E when 
s is equal to Sn = 
~;; for n = 1,2, . .. As we will now see, these poles indicate that 
strong electric fields can create electron-positron pairs, a process known as Schwinger 
pair production (although it was predicted first by Euler and Heisenberg). 
How can electrons and positrons be produced from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, 
which has no electron field in it? They cannot. However, in a unitary quantum field theory, 

33.4 Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian 
forward scattering rates are related to the sum Over real production rates via the optical 
theorem. Recall from Section 24.1 that by the optical theorem (see Eq. (24.11)) 
) _ l~ x

We can apply this theorem to QED in the situation where IA) corresponds to a coherent 
collection of photons describing a large electric field. In QED, the sum over states IX) 
includes states with on-shell electrons and positrons. Since QED is unitary, the optical 
theorem holds. In the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian the states IA) are the same states as 
in QED. Thus, if the calculation of LEH has been done correctly, the left-hand side of 
Eq. (33.91) should be unchanged, as one would expect from a matching calculation. The 
right-hand side ofEq. (33.91), on the other hand, cannot be the same as in full QED, since 
QED has electrons in it and the Euler-Heisenberg theory does not. Thus, what would be a 
unitary process in full QED now appears as a non-unitary process in the effective theory. 
Unfortunately, it is not easy to use Eq. (33.91) to calculate the pair-production rate, since 
one would have to sum over an infinite number of multi-particle states. 
There is a nice shortcut, due to Schwinger, for evaluating the total pair-production rate. 
If there were no pair production, then the electric field state IA) would be constant in time. 
Thus (A ISIA) = 1 where S is the S-matrix. Since in this case the action is constant, S = 
eir. Therefore, I(AI eir 1A)1 2 = leir l
2 measures the probability for something other than 
A to be produced. In other words, 1 eir 12 gives the probability that no pairs are produced 
over the time T and volume V of the experiment. We then have 
(33.92) 
where in the last step we use that, for given background fields, the Euler-Heisenberg 
Lagrangian is just a number. Thus 2ImLEH is the probability, per unit time and volume, 
that any number of pairs are created. This is the continuum field version of the optical 
theorem relation ImM (A -> A) = mAr tob where r tot is the total decay rate of a single 
particle of mass mAo 
In order to calculate ImLEH we note that the integrand in Eq. (33.89) has poles at 
Sn = 
e~n. There is no pole at S = 0, as can be seen from expanding the integrand at 
small S. The imaginary part of this expression can be calculated using contour integration 
(Problem 33.3). The result is that2 
(33.93) 
Performing this sum, we find 
r (E -> e + e - pairs) = ~:: Li2 (e - "e'E
2
) 
) 
(33.94) 
with Li2 (x) the dilogarithm function. This is the rate for Schwinger pair production in an 
external electric field. 
2 This sum also has an interpretation as a sum over instantons (see for example [Kim and Page, 2002]).

The rate for pair production is negligible until E ;:, E critical = ~ ~ 1018 voltS/meter 
which is an enormous field. As of this writing, Schwinger pair production in QED has stili 
not been observed, since it is extremely difficult to get such fields in the lab. One might 
imagine, however, that such strong fields might be produced close to a particle with a very 
large charge, such as an atomic nucleus. The field around a nucleus is E "" 4:r~ Z. Now 
the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian is only valid for fields that have wavelengths greate; 
than 1~ o ' so the best we can say is that pair production would begin for Z large enough that

33.4.4 Connection to perturbation theory 
It is informative to consider which of the predictions we have derived from LEH are 
equivalent to perturbative calculations in QED, and which are not. 
2 
We found that the Schwinger pair-production rate depended on exp( - "err;; ). This depen-
dence on e indicates that pair production is a non-perturbative effect - you would never see 
pair production from constant electric fields at any fixed order in perturbative QED. Of 
course, you can get pair production in perturbation theory. But this would involve pho-
ton modes of frequencies larger than m. More precisely, one can show that [Itzykson and 
Zuber, 1980] 
r(E --'> e+e- ) = ~ J d4q()(q2 - 4m) (E(q)2f j1- 4~2 (1 + 2~2) 
(33.95) 
which vanishes when if is constant. The Schwinger pair-production rate is one of the 
very few analytic non-perturbative calculations in quantum field theory that give physical 
predictions. 
Other results, such as the rate for Iight-by-light scattering, could be calculated in per-
turbative QED. Nevertheless, the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian efficiently encodes the 
result of many loop calculations all at once. It is worth discussing exactly what graphs 
are included in the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, since this understanding will apply to 
similar effective actions in other contexts. 
Recall our expression for the effective Lagrangian where the fermion is integrated out, 
Eq. (33.38), 
(33.96) 
We have not assumed ~ L/I j con. tant at thi point, and in fact this effective action is exact. 
That is, since the Lagrangian was quadrati in 'l/J, this is a formal expression for the result 
of evaluating the path integral of 'I/J completely. It does, however, conespond to only I-loop 
3 This result actually follows more simply from dimensional analysis. The ground state of a hydrogen-like atom 
has energy Eo ~ - Z2Q2m e . To get pair production, a nucleus has to be able to capture an electron from the 
vacuum. emitting a positron into the continuum, so E o .:s - m e giving Z ?: ±, up to order I factors, which 
we cannot get by dimensional analysis. 

33.4 Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian 
graphs, those in Eq. (33.40), since there is only a single propagator going from x back to x 
in proper time s. But how can this expression be exact if it does not include higher loops? 
Are graphs such as 
or 
(33.97) 
which have internal photon and/or fermion loops, included or not? 
To answer this question, first recall that in the calculation of the effective action, and in 
the formal exact expression Eq. (33.38), the photon propagator plays no role. In fact, if we 
dropped the photon kinetic term from the original action, the only change in the effective 
action would be that the - j- F~v term would be missing. Thus, neither of the graphs above 
are included in the effective action calculation, since both involve the photon propagator. 
On the other hand, since nothing is thrown out (assuming the effective action f[A] is known 
exactly), any physical effect associated with these graphs must be reproducible within the 
effective theory. For example, these graphs in full QED contribute to the QED ,B-function, 
which has physical effects. The way the effective theory reproduces the physics of these 
loops is with its own loops involving effective vertices. Basically, the fermion loops are 
computed first, treating the photon lines as external, which generates new vertices. Then 
the photon lines coming off these vertices are sewn together in a loop amplitude using the 
photon propagator in the effective theory. 
For example, to reproduce the physics of the first graph in Eq. (33.97), the relevant 
effective vertex can be determined by cutting through the intermediate photon and then 
contracting the fermion loop to a point: 
(33.98) 
The second graph in Eq. (33.97) involves this vertex, associated with the inner fermion 
loop, and a 6-point vertex associated with the outer fermion loop. The physics of the 
diagrams in Eq. (33.97) are then reproduced by connecting the legs in these effective 
vertices: 
and 
(33.99) 
These graphs would reproduce the complete result from the graphs in Eq. (33.97), but we 
need the full Leff[A] to compute them. 
721 

722 
Effective actions and Schwinger proper time 
....... ---------------------------------------------------
In the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, we took FJ.iI/ constant. Thus, the full physics of the 
loops in Eq. (33.97) is not reproduced by the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian alone. Only if 
we had the full effective Lagrangian, by evaluating r[A] exactly, which would supplement 
the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian with additional terms depending on 8J.iFet{3 (and give 
corrections at higher order in a to the terms without derivatives), would the full theory be 
reproduced. This exact r[A] is not known. 
Even at energies above m e, the exact effective Lagrangian can be used. The electron 
still shows up as a pole in the scattering amplitude, as is clear already from Schwinger 
pair production in the constant FJ.i1/ approximation. Thus, one can treat the electron like a 
bound state and calculate S-matrix elements for it. Of course, this is a terribly ineffiCient 
way to calculate electron production and scattering, since we already know the full theory. 
It is more efficient to use the UV completion of r , namely QED, which has a Lagrangian 
that is local and real. 
33.5 Coupling to other currents 
The effective action from integrating out 1jJ can be generalized to the case where 1jJ couples 
to other things besides AI" In this way, we can calculate things such as the 7r0 -+ " 
rate, 
where 7r0 is the neutral pion from QCD (see Chapter 28). 
When 1jJ couples to things other than AJ.i' the effective Lagrangian has more terms. Say 
we had 
£ = 1[;(if/J - m)1jJ -
~¢(O + m~)¢ -
~7r(0 + m;)7r - eAJ.i1[;,J.i1jJ + >.¢1[;1jJ + g7r1[;,51jJ, 
(33.100) 
which has a scalar ¢ and a pseudoscalar 7r in addition to the external field Aw When we 
integrate out 'IjJ, the effective Lagrangian (without 1jJ) will just contain the other fields cou-
pled to the expectation value of the various 'IjJ bilinears in the background electromagnetic 
field, as in Section 33.2.2. That is,

eAJ.iJ~ + >'¢J</> + g7r J11" 
(33.101) 
where 
(33.102) 
We sometimes call these field-dependent expectation values classical currents, since they 
are just classical functionals of background AJ.i (x) fields. The calculation of these classical 
currents corresponds to the evaluation of Feynman diagrams such as 
(33.103) 

33.5 Coupling to other currents 
Here, the ® refers to insertions of the external current in the original theory, corresponding 
to an interaction with the scalar. The photon lines are the background electromagnetic 
fields. 
For the scalar cunent, 
J¢ = (AI?,b(x)?j;(x)IA) = Tr[(xIGAlx)]

=4m 1= 
ds e-ism2 (xle-iHSlx). 
(33.104) 
You may notice that J¢ = a:.ceff[A], with .ceff[A] in Eq. (33.38), a result that is useful 
and not surprising, since the ¢;j;?j; interaction and the mass term m;j;?j; have the same form. 
For the pseudoscalar current, 
J1': = (AI;j;(x)-l?j;(x)IA) = -Tr[(X IGA'llx)] 
= -Tr [1

(33.105) 
This current does not have a simple relation to .ceff [A], but as we will see, is not hard to 
compute. 
33.5.1 Currents at low energy 
Since the scalar current is J ¢ = a: .ceff [A], for the case of constant electromagnetic 
fields, we can read the answer from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, although additional 
counterterms may be required. We find (hiding the counterterms)

Note that the 7f coupling has just one term. The decay rates predicted from this effective 
Lagrangian are 
(33.114) 
(33.115) 
Not surplisingly, the pseudoscalar rate agrees exactly with Eq. (30.11). In this method of 
calculation, however, we gain additional insight into the associated anomaly. 
33.5.2 Chiral anomaly 
Connecting the 7f -+ 'Y'Y rate to an anomalous symmetry is straightforward in the effective 
action language. Recall that the QED Lagrangian, 
.c = if;(if/J - ieJ,.)'Ij; + mif;'Ij;, 
(33.116) 
is invariant under a vector symmetry, 'Ij; -+ eiO/'Ij;, and, in the limit m -+ 0, under a chiral 
, 
-
5 
symmetry, 'Ij; -+ etf5 '1j;. The associated Noether currents are JfJ-
'Ij;'YfJ-'Ij; and JfJ-
=== 
if;'Y/L'Ys'Ij;. By the equations of motion, the axial current satisfies 
(33.117) 
So the amount by which the axial current is not conserved is proportional to the fermion 
mass. 

33.6 Semi-classical and non-relativistic limits 
Now, we already calculated the expectation value of i/J'Y5'ljJ in the background electro-
magnetic field. In Eq. (33.111) we found (A Ii/J'Y5'ljJIA) = i 4::m Fl-'vF/J,V' This is consistent 
with Eq. (33.116) only if 
(AloI-'JI-'5IA) = - 2:FI-'l/FI-'l/' 
which agrees with Eq. (30.22). 
(33.118) 
33.6 Semi-classical and non-relativistic limits 
The Schwinger proper-time method is not only useful for calculating loops using quantum 
mechanics, it also gives a new perspective on the semi-classical and non-relativistic limits 
of quantum field theory. In particular, it illustrates where the particles are hiding in the 
path integral. As we will see, Schwinger proper time lets us derive one-particle quantum 
mechanics as the low-energy limit of quantum field theory. 
To begin, we return to the expression for the Green's function we derived above for a 
scalar particle in a background electromagnetic field, Eq. (33.22): 
G A(X, y) = (AIT{ ¢(x)¢(y)}IA) = 10= 
ds e-ism2 (Yle- iHSlx), 
(33.119) 
with iI = -(p - eA(x))2. This operator iI is the Hamiltonian in a one-particle quantum 
mechanical system that generates translations in Schwinger proper time s. The func-
tion GA(X,y) is computed for constant electromagnetic fields in Appendix 33.A. In this 
section, we rewrite G A (x, y) in terms of a quantum mechanical path integral. 
In quantum mechanics, the path integral gives the amplitude for a particle to propagate 
from xl-' to yl-' in time S (see Section 14.2.2): 
(Yle-iHSlx) = jZ(S)=Y VZ(T) exp(i J 
dT .c(z, i)), 
z(O)=x 
(33.120) 
where .c = pit - iI is the Legendre transform of the Hamiltonian. We would like to work 
out this Lagrangian in the case of a scalar in an electromagnetic field. 
To simplify things, we first write iI = - IT2 , where ITI-' = pI-' - eAI-' (x). The Heisenberg 
equations of motion for translation in s are

(33.124) 
This is an exact formal expression, only useful to the extent that we can solve for Z(T) . 
This world-line formulation was derived by a different method by Feynman [Feynman 
1950], although it had little application for many years. Interest in this approach wa~ 
revived by Polyakov [Polyakov, 1981] in the context of string theory, and by Bern and 
Kosower [Bern and Kosower, ]992] who used it to develop an efficient way to compute 
loop diagrams in QeD. 
33.6.1 Semi-classical limit 
In the limit that a particle is very massive, loops involving that particle are suppressed. 
Thus, it should be possible to treat a massive particle classically and the radiation it 
produces quantum mechanically. 
To take the large mass limit, we first rescale s ---t r:,2 and T ---t ~. This gives 
Now we see that, for large m, the m 2 ( ~~;)2 term completely dominates the path integral. 
Moreover, as m ---t 00, the action is dominated by the point of stationary phase, which is 
also the classical free-particle solution: 
(33.126) 
where vf1- = 
yl"~XM is the particle's velocity. So we get, rescaling s ---t sm2 back again, 
and plugging in the stationary phase solution, 
GA(x,y) = 1
00 
dsexp ( -i[sm2 + (y ~sX)2 + eVf1- 1
s 
dTAf1-(Z(T))]). 
(33.127) 
The first two terms in the exponent are independent of e and repre ent propagation of 
a free particle, similar to Eq. (33.ll). The next term i equivalenl to adding a term to the 
Lagrangian L = - eAf1-J/:, where J/: i Ih 
ource CllrreJ1l from a cIa ical ma sive particle 
moving at constant velocity: 
J;:(x) = vf1-0(x - VT) . 
(33.128) 
In words, a heavy particle produces a gauge potential All as if it is moving at a constant 
velocity. 

33.6 Semi-classical and non-relativistic limits 
This is the semi-classical limit. When a particle is heavy, the quantum field theory can 
be approximated by treating that particle as a classical source, but treating everything else 
quantum mechanically. You can study the fermion case in Problem 33.4. 
33.6.2 Non-relativistic limit 
In the non-relativistic limit, not only is the particle's mass assumed to be larger than the 
energy of typical photons, but the particle's velocity is also assumed to be much less than 
the speed of light. Define /:::,f; = yO -
XO and /:::'x = 117 - xl A particle moving slowly from 
xl" to yl" has /:::'t » /:::' x. 
Separating out the time component, the 2-point function in Eq. (33.123) becomes 
The classical path that minimizes the action, from the large m limit, has 
(33.130) 
We want to treat this time evolution classically, and leave the rest of the field fluctuations 
quantum mechanical. However, we can see that since both (g~:)2 and m 2 are large, the 
stationary phase will have ~; rv m and so s rv !i';'. That is, the integral is dominated by 
the region near zO = xO + 2mT and s = !i';'. To leading order in the expansion of sand 
zO around their stationary-phase points, we then find 
Now we change variables to T = 2~ to find

(33.132) 
This result is exactly the path integral expression in non-relativistic, first-quantized quan-
tum mechanics with a potential V = m. We have just derived that the non-relativistic limit 
of quantum field theory is quantum mechanics!

Our starting point is the formula for the effective action in Eq. (33.38): 
(33.A.133) 
with if = _(pJ.t _ eAJ.t(x))2 + ~ FlJ II(i·)O'Jw . We have dropped the c term, since we wil\ 
not need it with this method. Here A/.(x) is (0 be thought of as a classical gauge field 
configurati0An with position replaced by the operator X. We .would like to ~alculate L!'ff(X) 
when F~v.(x) = (8J.tA

_ 8I1A,~)(x) is con lant. We begll1 by calculatmg (yle- iHslx). 
Once thIS IS known, we will set y = ;l: and integral over 5 to get .Leff. 
33.A.1 proper-time propagation 
States such as Ix) are eigenstates of an operator xJ.t in a first-quantized Hilbert space. The 
operators xJ.t are Schrodinger-picture operators. They are related to .Heisenberg-picture 
operators by xJ.t(s) = eiHsxJ.te-iHs. Using the definition Ix; s) == e-iHslx) we find 
(33.A.134) 
Now, 
(33.A.135) 
and 
(33.A.136) 
Thus, if we can write if in terms of x(O) and x( s) we can turn Eq. (33.133) into an ordinary 
differential equation whose solution gives (y; olx; s). 
In quantum mechanics, the position and momentum operators satisfy [x, p] = i. In our 
4D first-quantized setup we generalize this to 
(33.A. 137) 
with the commutation applying at the same proper time s. To simplify the form of tl~C 
Hamiltonian, we introduce the operator IrJ.t = pJ.t - eAJ.L(x). Then, assuming Fin, IS 
constant, we get 
(33.A.13K) 

33.A Schwinger's method 
[fIl-'(s), fIV(s)] = -ieFl-'v. 
(33.A.139) 
In terms of ITI-', the Hamiltonian is 
H(s) = -:Vt2 = -fIl-'(s)ITI-'(s) + ~Fi'val-'V. 
(33.A.140) 
For simplicity, we will drop circumflexes on operators from now on. As a notational con-
venience, we will also replace J.L and v indices with boldface type. So the vectors xl-' and 
III-' are written as x and TI, respectively, and the matrices FILv and aILv are written as F 
and 0' respectively. Then tr( 0' F) = -a flVFi'V, with tr(· .. ) referring to a trace over J.L and 
v indices in this context. 
In this notation, the evolution of TIlL (s) generated by the Hamiltonian H (s) through the 
Heisenberg equations of motion becomes

(33.A.141)

This solution is easy to check by differentiating. In the limit A ...... 0, TI ...... p and this 
becomes x(s) = x(O) + 2sp(0), which is consistent with the eigenstates of x(s) being 
those which evolve into position XIL after a time s.

To evaluate (yle- iHS Hlx) in Eq. (33.133) using H, it is helpful first to rewrite H so 
that x( s) is on the left and x(O) is on the right. This is not hard: 
U(s) ·TI(s) = x(s)Kx(s )- 2x(s)Kx(O)+x(0)Kx(0)+Ki'V [xi'(s), XV (0)]. (33.A.147)

Background fields 
II 
In Chapter 33, we explored how fields could be integrated out exactly leaving an effective 
action. The concrete example we considered was integrating out the electron from QED. 
Then we defined the effective action r[A] = J d4 x .ceff by the relation 
In the special case where we are not concerned with the dynamics of AI" we can treat AI" 
as a classical background and drop the J VA on both sides. For example, in Chapter 33 
we were able to do the integral over the electron field ~ and 'if; exactly if we assumed 
that Fl"v was a space-time-independent classical background field, leading to the Euler-
Heisenberg effective Lagrangian. The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian differs from the exact 
.ceff [A] in that it does not contain terms with derivatives acting on Fl"v such as --4 (Oo.Fl"v)2 
me 
(since these terms vanish for constant Fl"v)' For predictions at low energy, terms with extra 
derivatives have effects suppressed by factors of ~, and we can ignore them to a first 
m e 
approximation. 
A fantastic feature of the Euler-Heisenberg example was that all the work was done in 
calculating .ceff[A]. Once .ceff was known, it was used to make a number of quantitative 
physical predictions with little additional effort: Schwinger pair production, light-by-
light scattering, the chiral anomaly, etc. These predictions were made by using .ceff as 
a classical Lagrangian generating only tree-level Feynman diagrams. Of course, for the 
Euler-Heisenberg case, this was only an approximation since we were just ignoring the 
dynamics of Aw But imagine how powerful the effective action would be if it were exact. 
An action r[AI"' ~ ' 'if;] which when used classically (at tree-level) reproduces all of the 
physics of a full quantum theory is called a IPI effective action (for reasons that will soon 
become clear). The only difference between 1 PI effective actions and effective actions 
like those discussed in Chapter 33 is that those actions had only some subset of the fields 
integrated out; for a IPI effective action, all the fields are integrated out. 
One can compute a IPI effective action by matching, that is by evaluating loops in the 
full theory and demanding that the effective action, when used at tree-level, agrees order-
by-order in perturbation theory with the full theory. As we show in Section 34.1.1, terms in 
the effective Lagrangian computed in this way are easily seen to correspond to one-particle 
irreducible diagrams in the full theory. An alternative approach (Section 34.1.2) is to iden-
tify the effective action as a Legendre transform of the generating functional of connected 
diagrams W[J]. (W[J] is related to the generating functional Z[J] from Section 14.3 as 
W[J] = - ilnZ[J].) This lets us identify the minimum ofr[</>] as the expectation of </> in 
the vacuum: r'[(</»] = O. As we will see, the Legendre transform approach also leads to 
733 

734 
Background fields 
--------------------------------------------------------
an alternative way to compute the effective action by shifting fields (Section 34.1.4): Write 
S[¢b + ¢] and integrate out ¢ leading to r[¢b]. In this approach, called the background. 
field method, ¢ represents the quantum fluctuations around a classical background ¢b. If 
we assume the background field ¢b is constant then the IPI effective action can be written 
as r[ ¢b 1 = - VTVeff( ¢b) with Veff( ¢h) known as the effective p tential. 
An example where the details of the effective potential are very important i in th case of 
spontaneous symmetry breaking. Consider the case of a ' ingle calar Ii ld with Lagrangian

(34.2) 
As we saw in Chapter 28, if m 2 > 0, the system is stable, but if m2 < 0 the system is 
unstable and spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. But what happens if m = O? To find 
out if the system with m = 0 is stable or not, we need to include quantum corrections. More 
generally, we would like to know how big the quantum cOlTecti n. arc 
ince they could 
conceivably flip the sign of the mass term. Quantum orrec[ion. are efficiently encoded 
in the effective potential. In this case, the effective potential is known a the Coleman_ 
Weinberg potential. Its minimum tells us the true quantum value of ¢. This potential has 
important implications for the Higgs potential in the Standard Model, as we discuss in 
Section 34.2.3. 
Another important application of the background-field method is in non-Abelian gauge 
theories. If we replace A~ ~ A~ + A~ and integrate out A~, we get a IPI effective 
action I1A~]. We can integrate out A~ order-by-or~er in perturbation theory by computing 
Feynman diagrams with fixed background fields A~. An advantage of this approach over 
ordinary perturbation theory is that since only the quantum field A~ propagates, only it 
has to be gauge-fixed. Thu. 
ne can choo. e a gauge-6xin[ functional that respects an 
exact gauge invariance a ociated with (he background field A~ . Ln this background-field 
gauge, which really is a family f gauge pm'ametrized by a number {, the IPI effective 
action is guaranteed to be gauge invariant. This is in contrast to the approach in Chapter 26, 
where in covariant Rf. gauges, the gauge-fixing parameter e appeared all over the place: 
in Green's functions, in counterterms, etc. In background-fi.el.d gauge, [he renormalization 
constants will be { independent. This will provide a quick way to PI' duce th QCD {3-
function, requiring only I-loop corrections to the glu n 2-point function be computed, not 
any 3-point functions (in the ordinary method we had to compute some I-loop 3-point 
graphs). 
]n general the I PI effective action is not guaranteed to be gauge invariant, although 
phy ica! predictions coming from it must be. Two examples of how [his work. are ~s­
cu 'sed: the effective potential in scalar QED is discussed in S ction 34.2.4 and the r [A~l 
in non-covariant gauges are discussed in Section 34.3.3. 
Here, we leave time ordering and the vacuum implicit, so (- . . ) == (nIT{- .. }In). Al 0

34.1 1 PI effective action 
34.1 1 PI effective action 
In this section we discuss how to compute a IPI effective action, by matching (Sec-
tion 34.1.1), through a Legendre transform (Section 34.1.2), or through a background-field 
calculation (Section 34.1.4). 
34.1.1 Matching 
Our goal is to compute a IPI effective action r defined so that if used classically (at tree-
level), it reproduces Green's functions in the full quantum theory. For example, in QED, we 
saw in Chapter 18 that the 2-point Green's function for the electron, including all quantum 
corrections, could be written as 
G(x, y) = (7jJ(x)1jj(y)) = J 
(~:~4 e-ip(x-y) 'P _ m ~ ~(p)' 
(34.3) 
where ~(p) is the sum of all IPI contributions to the electron self-energy graph. For this to 
come out of a tree-level calculation, we must take the kinetic terms for 7jJ in the effective 
Lagrangian to have the form L~~ = 1jj[iq) - m + ~(iq))J7jJ. 
In fact, in QED we already know what a number of the terms should look like: 
r = J 
d4x{ 1jj[iq) - m + ~(iq))J7jJ 
- e1jjr'-'(iq))AI-'7jJ -
~A/-,(iYL8V - Og/-'''')(1 + II(-O))Av + ... }, 
(34.4) 
where ~(p) is the sum of alliPI contributions to the electron self-energy graph, - erl-'(p) 
is the sum of alliPI vertex corrections (with on-shell spinors), and II(p2) is the IPI contri-
butions to the vacuum polarization function. Each of these was computed at I-loop in Part 
III (see Chapter 29). The· .. represent higher-dimension operators, such as (F~v?' which 
should generically be present. To compute these terms, one would need the set of IPI con-
tributions to 4-point and higher-point functions. For example, an additional set of terms 
(those with no derivatives acting on F/-,,,,) was computed at I-loop in the Euler-Heisenberg 
Lagrangian. In general, each term in the effective action contains all the IPI contributions 
to the n-point function with the fields in that term. That is why we call r the IPI effective 
action. (For the kinetic term, we conventionally define ~(iq)) to be all the IPI graphs except 
for the free propagator.) 
Taking derivatives of the effective Lagrangian with respect to the fields generates IPI 
Green's functions. Two derivatives give the inverse of the IPI 2-point function: 
_ 
{8 8 
_ }-l 
(7jJ(x)7jJ(y))1PI = 
81jJ(x) 81jj(y) (-i)r[7jJ, 7jJ, A] 
-.f={;= A=O· 
(34.5) 
Applying Eq. (34.5) to Eq. (34.4) reproduces Eq. (34.3). This should be reminiscent of how 
Green's functions come from derivatives of the generating functional Z[ J], a connection 
735 

736 
Background fields 
~ ..... -----------------------------------------------
that will be exploited in Section 34.l.2. In the same way, the IPI contributions to the 
3-point function are 
(34.6) 
For 4-point functions we find 
and so on. 
To compute complete Green's functions, we can string together IPI diagrams. For the 
2-point function, 
~ 0 
~ 
= 
~ 0 
~ 
+ ~ 
+ .. . . 
(34.8) 
The 4-point function gets tree-level contributions from the effective action from its IPI 
vertex as well as connected contributions to lower-point amplitudes: 
= 
+ 
+ crossings. 
(34.9) 
The 4-point function also gets a contribution from disconnected diagrams given by the 
product of two connected 2-point functions. Although disconnected diagrams can be com-
puted with the effective action, they are not of much interest since they do not contribute 
to S-matrix elements. Proceeding in this way, Green's functions in the full quantum theory 
can be constructed from tree-level diagrams using the IPI effective action. 
By the way, you might be wondering, if we can get the results of the full quantum 
theory with classical physics, why bother with loops at all? That is, why not just start from 
the effective action? The answer is that effective actions are in general highly non-local 
and hopelessly unconstrained. We have written r = J d4x L eff for notational simplicity, 
but not all effective actions can be written this way. For example, we might have found 
a contribution to a if;(Qd'lj;(Q2)'l/J(Q3)if;(q4) IPI diagram of the form iq2 +q3j~ . This could 
ql +q2 
come from a term in an effective action such as 
(34.10) 
which is very manifestly non-local. If we start with a local classical action and then perform 
the loops, things such as locality, Lorentz invariance and causality are easier to check and 

34.1 1 PI effective action 
confirm. Since the effective action contains basically the same information as the full S-
matrix, a construction of an effective action from first plinciples (unitarity, analyticity etc.) 
is essentially equivalent to the S-matrix program of the 1950s and 19605. This approach 
may eventually prove predictive, but at this point only effective actions derived from local 
classical Lagrangians are known to be consistent. 
On the other hand, if one expands the effective action at energies well below some 
physical scale, one should be able to write it as a series of local terms. In fact, this is 
the approach to most effective field theories, such as the 4-Fermi theory or the Chiral 
Lagrangian (although in these cases one leaves some fields as dynamical). In a low-energy 
limit, thinking of the effective action as being a series of terms can be useful. Since the 
effective action should obey the same symmetries as the classical action, the effective 
action should contain all terms consistent with those symmetries. Thus, a quick-and-dirty 
approach is to write down an effective action with all possible terms respecting the sym-
metries of the classical action, with coefficients (representing all the IPI graphs) estimated 
by dimensional analysis. We usually assume that anything that can happen from such an 
effective action will happen - if something does not happen, there should be a symme-
try reason for it. This approach is particularly useful in strongly coupled theories, such as 
low-energy QCD, and explains the success of the Chiral Lagrangian. 
34.1.2 Legendre transform 
At this point, we have defined a IPI effective action so that the vertices conespond to the 
sum of all 1 PI contributions to Green's functions. Although one can compute these vertices 
by simply evaluating the IPI graphs, one can also compute the effective action through a 
Legendre transform. This method is very powerful and gives us new intuition for how to 
think about the effective action, for example, showing that r' [( ¢)] = O. It also lets us 
justify the background-field method, which is the subject of most of this chapter. 
The key result, which we will now derive, is that r[¢] is the Legendre transform of a 
functional "J,llP] == - i In ZP]: 
(34.11) 
In this equation, J¢ is an implicit functional of ¢ defined as the solution to 
oW[J] I 
= ¢(x). 
oJ (x) J=J,p 
(34.12) 
These are the analogs of the Hamiltonian being the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian: 
H['if] = L [xrrJ - X7r'if with xrr an implicit function of 'if defined so that &~l:i;ll :i;=:i;". = 'if. 
The conjugate relation comes from varying Eq. (34.11) with respect to ¢: 
(34.13) 
737 

738 
Background fields 
c===~. ----------------------------------------------___ 
This lets us define ¢J as an implicit functional of J satisfying 
ar[¢] I

a¢ 
¢=¢J 
(34.14) 
which gives the inverse Legendre transform 
W[J] = r[¢J] + J 
d4xJ(x)¢J(x). 
(34.15) 
Equations (34.14) and (34.15) are the analogs of L[x] = H[7r] + 7r±X with 7r± an impliCit 
function of x defined so that a~l7rj 17r=7r
x = -x. Varying Eq. (34.15) with respect to J

(34.16) 
and brings us full circle back to Eq. (34.12). We will now take Eq. (34.11) as a new defi-
nition of r[¢] and show that it agrees with our previous definition, as the functional whose 
vertices are the sums of 1PI graphs. 
The first task is to get to know W [J]. It is defined by 
eKW[Jj = Z[J] = J 
D¢exp { ~ [s[¢] + J 
d
4x J¢]}, 
(34.17) 
where the n factors are restored here for later reference. Now, recall from Section 14.3 that 
Z[J] generates Green's functions via 
(34.18) 
Usually, we set J = 0 after taking the derivatives, turning the left-hand side of this equation 
into a vacuum matrix element. With J -I- 0, Z[J] generates Green's functions for ¢ in a 
background given by a classical cunent J(x) (see Chapter 33 for an example). A helpful 
way to think about W[J] is that it generates all connected diagrams: 
.

8n W[J] 
. 
( -~n) aJ(x1)' " aJ(x
n
) = -~n(JI¢(x1)'" ¢(xn)IJ)connected' 
(34.19) 
For example, taking n = 2 we find using W[J] = - inln Z[J] that

(34.20) 
where J i = J(Xi) is the same shorthand used in Section 14.3.2. The first term on the 
second line is the full Green's function, in the presence of the source, including connected 
and disconnected pieces. The second term is the disconnected pieces, which are subtracted 
off. You can try other examples and prove this interpretation of W[J] in Problem 34.1.

This gives us a physical interpretation of the Legendre relation in Eq. (34.12): for a given 
(classical) field configuration ¢c(x), the current J",c (x) is precisely the current in whose 
presence the expectation value of ¢ is ¢c: (J",c 1¢IJ",cI = ¢c' Conversely, since ¢J = 
~';(~], from Eq. (34.16) we see that ¢J can be identified as the expectation value of ¢ in 
the presence of a given current J: ¢J = (11¢IJ). Thus, ¢J", = ¢ and J¢J = J , as one 
would expect. 
Now we are ready to show that r[¢] in Eq. (34.11) is the same effective action whose 
vertices contain all the IPI graphs. Such an effective action, when used at tree-level, should 
give the same Green's functions as the action S[¢] would, including loops. Since tree-level 
contributions are classical, we only need to isolate the leading contribution as h ----; O. Since 
each term in ~S[¢] has a factor of ~, vertices and external states come with factors of ~ 
while propagators come with factors of h. The overall scaling of some sample diagrams is 
shown in Table 34.1. We see that connected tree-level diagrams scale as h -1, and each loop 
adds a factor of n. Disconnected diagrams can violate this scaling, but do not contribute to 
the S-matrix (see Problem 34.1). 
Now we can relate the effective action to W[ J], Since all connected diagrams can either 
be computed with W[ J] = -ih In Z[ J] using S[ ¢] to all orders in h, or they can be com-
puted with the equivalent of W [J] constructed using r[ ¢] instead of S [¢] in the h ----; 0 
limit, we must have 
(34.22) 
Taking h ----; 0 isolates exactly the tree-level diagrams computed using f[¢]. Taking h ----; 0 
also forces the field configurations contributing to the path integral to be exactly those that 
extremize the action. Thus, the ¢ integral just replaces ¢ by ¢J defined by [)~~/ I = -J 
as in Eq. (34.14). This leads to 
W[J] = r[¢J] + J 
d4x J(x) ¢J(x), 
(34.23) 
which is the (inverse) Legendre transform in Eq. (34.15).

Background fields 
----------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, the functional f[¢], defined as the Legendre transform of W[J], is the IPI 
effective action r[¢] described in Section 34.1.1, whose ve11ices are sums of IPI diagrarns 
in the full quantum theory. 
34.1.3 Cross checks 
----------------------------------------------------------------
To make the Legendre transform less abstract, let us try some examples. First, We win 
calculate the effective action for a free scalar field. We start with the Lagrangian .c ~ 
- ~¢(D + m 2 )¢. Then W[J] is calculated by performing a Gaussian path integral: 
W[J] = - i ln J 
v¢exp { i J 
d
4x [-~¢(O + m2)¢ + J¢] } 
J 
4 1 
1 
= 
d X"2 J 0 + m 2 J + const. 
To Legendre transform, we need J¢, which is defined to solve 
¢(x) = oW[J] I 
[)J(x) J=J", 
Thus, we find J¢ = (0 + m 2 )¢ and 
1 
o 
2 J¢(x). 
+m 
(34.24) 
(34.25) 
r[¢] = W[J¢] - J 
d4x J¢(x) ¢(x) = J 
d4x [-~¢(O + m2)¢] + const. 
(34.26) 
So, the effective action is identical to the classical action for a free-field theory (up to a 
constant), as we should expect. 
As another check, let us verify that, in an interacting theory, derivatives of r[¢] with 
respect to ¢ do generate full IPI Green's functions, as in Section 34.1.1. First, we take one 
derivative and reproduce Eq. (34.13): 
or[¢] = -J¢ 
o¢ 
. 
(34.27) 
This equation implies that the field configuration ¢o that satisfies this equation for J¢ = 0 
satisfies the classical equations of motion using the action r[¢]. The same field configura-
tion also has ¢o = a~y) I 
= (¢) by Eq. (34.21). In other words, the effective action is 
J=O 
minimized by the field configuration given by the expectation value of the quantum field ¢ 
in the true vacuum of the theory. 
Taking two de11vatives should give the inverse of the 2-point function, as in Eq. (34.5). 
To check this, we note that 
. 
02W 
I

G(x, y) = (¢(x)¢(y)) = -~ [)J(x) oJ(y) J=O = -2 oJ(x) J=o'

where ~~~) = ¢J(x) from Eq. (34.16) has been used. Thus we find

Brff.x)[)¢(Y) ¢=¢o = - o¢(x) J=O = ~G(x, y)

(34.29) 
where Eq. (34.27) has been used. This agrees with the equivalent of Eq. (34.5) for a scalar 
theory, except instead of evaluating ¢ = 0 we must evaluate ¢ on its expectation value 

34.1 1 PI effective action 
¢o = (¢) (in QED, these are the same since 'ljJ,;jJ and AIL have vanishing expectation 
values). 
34.1.4 Background fields 
At this point we have discussed some properties of the functional r [¢]: 
• It can be used at tree-level to generate Green's functions of ¢. 
• Its vertices correspond to the sum of IPI contributions to Green's functions with a given 
number of external states. 
• It is formally given by the Legendre transform of W[ J] = -i In Z[ J]. 
• Its minimum is at the value ¢o = (¢) in the true vacuum of the theory. 
We can calculate r[¢] by matching - each term is just the 1PI Green's function for certain 
external states, as in Eq. (34.4). We also know how to calculate an approximation to r[¢] 
by integrating out other fields besides ¢, as in Eq. (34.1). What we would like to show next 
is how to include fluctuations of ¢ itself in the computation of r [¢]. 
To begin, suppose we have an action S[¢]. From S[¢] we can compute its IPI 
effective action r[¢] through a Legendre transform. Now shift ¢ 
---+ ¢b + ¢ for a 
non-dynamical, but arbitrary, background-field configuration ¢b(X). Non-dynamical in 
this context means that ¢b is not integrated over in the path integral. For example, if 
S[¢] = J d4x( -~¢D¢ + fr¢3) we would find 
(34.30) 
This new action Sb[¢b, ¢]leads to a new effective action rb[¢b, ¢] which depends on ¢b. 
We can compute rd¢b, ¢] by matching, designing it so that its vertices reproduce the 
IPI graphs with external ¢ fields. In doing this, we need to use the new vertices such 
as ~¢2¢b, which give new interactions. For example, the 2-point function might get 
contributions from 
= 
+ 
+~+
. 
(34.31) 
where the single lines represent ¢ fields and the grounded lines represent ¢b fields. Terms 
such as ~¢bD¢b or fr¢g with no ¢ fields can be pulled right out of the path integral, 
since ¢b is not dynamical. Also terms such as ~ ¢~ ¢ can be ignored, since they will never 
contribute to a IPI graph. Thus, the computation is equivalent to one performed with 
(34.32) 
Reducing the Lagrangian in this way is not necessary, but simplifies some computations. 
741 

742 
Background fields 
....... -----------------------------------------------------
What we will show next is that fb[¢>b, 0] = fb[O, ¢>b] = r[¢>b], where f[¢>] is the effective 
action containing the IPI graphs in S[¢>]. To prove this, start by defining 
exp(iWb[¢>b, J]) = J 
D¢> exp { is[¢>b + ¢>] + i J 
d4x J¢>} . 
(34.33) 
The analog of Eq. (34.16) is then 8W~~b,J) = ¢> J;b' Now shift ¢> ---+ ¢> -
¢>b in the path 
integral to give 
Wb[¢>b, J] = W[J]-J 
d4x J¢>b· 
(34.34) 
Differentiating with respect to J gives 8W~~b ,JJ = 8~yJ - ¢>b, which implies 
(34.35) 
This is quite a natural relation. It says that when we replace ¢> ---+ ¢>b + ¢> in the path integral, 
the expectation value ¢> of a field in a given current shifts by -¢>b. 
Now, fb[¢>b , ¢>] can be computed through the Legendre transform, as in Eq. (34.12) but 
with additional dependence on the background field: 
fb[¢>b, ¢>] = Wb[¢>b, J¢;b] - J 
d4x J¢;b¢>. 
(34.36) 
Then using Eq. (34.34), we find 
fb[¢>b, ¢>] = W[J¢;b]-J 
d
4x J¢;b(¢>b + ¢» . 
(34.37) 
Now we take ¢> = ¢>J;b, use Eq. (34.35), and that J¢J = J to get 
fb[¢>b, ¢>J;b] = W[J]-J 
d
4x J¢>J = r[¢>J] = r[¢>J;b + ¢>b]. 
(34.38) 
Since this holds for any J, we find fb[¢>b, ¢>] = r[¢> + ¢>b] and therefore r[¢>b] = fb[¢>b, 0] 
as desired. It is also true that r[¢>] = fb[O, ¢>], but setting ¢>b = ° does not get us 
anywhere. 
Computing f[¢>] with the relation f[¢>b] = n. 
[<Pb , OJ mean computing graphs with no 
¢>b particles in loops and no external ¢> fields from 5[4> + </>bl. At zeroth order, r[¢>b] = 
S[¢>b]. The leading-order contribution comes from vacuum bubbles (O-point functions) in 
a constant background field: 
+ .... (34.39) 
Calculating the effective action this way is known as the background-field method. 
An occasionally useful shorthand for f[¢>b] = fb[¢>b, 0] is 
eir[¢bJ = 1 
D¢> eiSI¢+¢bl , 
restr. 
(34.40) 

34.2 Background scalar fields 
where the subscript "restr." means that only a restricted set of field configurations can be 
integrated over. Without some kind of restriction, we could just shift ¢ ----+ ¢ - ¢b and r [¢b] 
would be independent of ¢b. In perturbation theory, this restricted set is the IPI diagrams. 
More generally, whatever field configurations are necessary to produce the effective action 
must be included. 
34.1.5 Summary 
In Chapter 33, we discussed effective actions coming from integrating out a subset of fields, 
such as Leff[A] from integrating out 1j; and'lj; in QED. In this chapter, we have introduced 
IPI effective actions r[¢] (or r [A, 1j;, 'Ij; 1 for QED), in which quantum fluctuations of all 
fields have been integrated out. The vertices in this action correspond to IPI diagrams. 
Thus, the IPI effective action can be used at tree-level to give Green's functions including 
all quantum corrections. In general, the IPI effective action is highly non-local. 
We then saw that the IPI effective action could be written concisely as a Legendre trans-
form r[¢] = W[J¢] - J d4x ¢J¢, where J¢ is an implicit functional of ¢ defined so that 
r'[¢] = -J¢ and W[J] = -ilnZ[J]. This leads to a physical picture of the effective 
action: the minimum of r[¢] is at ¢c = (¢), the expectation value of ¢ in the true vacuum 
of the theory. The value of r[¢] away from its minimum corresponds to the action for the 
quantum system in the presence of an external current J¢. Conversely, with a non-zero 
current J, the minimum of the action shifts to (JI¢IJ). Thus, the effective action maps 
out how the minimum moves when the theory is modified. To repeat: only the true ground 
state, with J = 0, describes the solution to the quantum theory with a given classical action 
S[¢]. Values of r[¢] for ¢ -I- (¢) correspond to solutions to a different quantum theory, 
one where an external current is present. 
Finally, we found a convenient relation: that r[¢b] could be computed by evaluating IPI 
graphs in a theory using S[¢ + ¢b] instead of S[¢]. Since only IPI graphs contribute, we 
can equally well use S[¢ + ¢b] - S'[¢b]¢, which removes all the tadpole terms from the 
Lagrangian. It is worth emphasizing that removing the tadpoles is very important - it is the 
main reason we had to go through this whole rigmarole with the Legendre transform. Away 
from the true minimum of r[¢] there is a non-zero current J¢. For example, suppose the 
action S[¢] has a minimum at ¢ = 0 but the effective action r[¢] does not; then Jo -I- O. 
In computing the effective action, we really want to integrate out fluctuations about the 
true minimum, not around ¢ = O. That is where the current comes in: the J ¢ term exactly 
compensates the tadpole for any value of ¢. Thus, we can do the r[¢] calculation for a 
general J¢ and then simply set J = 0 to find the true minimum. 
34.2 Background scalar fields 
In this section we give some examples of effective action calculations with background 
scalar fields. We begin with a simple ¢4 theory, where one can ask the interesting question 
of whether spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs for L = -
~ ¢O¢ - if ¢4. The effective 
743

....... ---------------------------------------------------
potential in this case is called the Coleman-Weinberg potential. The Coleman-Weinberg 
potential has important implications for the Standard Model: it can tell us whether very 
large values of the Higgs field, h » v, can give a lower-energy state than h = v. We 
also discuss the contribution of gauge fields to an effective action, through a scalar QED 
example. Although the effective potential becomes gauge dependent when gauge fields are 
included, physical predictions will be gauge independent. We give an example of such a 
physical prediction. 
34.2.1 The COleman-Weinberg potential 
Consider a general theory of a single scalar field ¢, with Lagrangian 
1 
£ = -"2¢O¢ - V[¢], 
(34.41) 
where V[¢] is some potential. For example, V = ~m2¢2 + -liA¢4. With these signs, the 
classical minimum is at ¢ = 0, which preserves the Z2 symmetry under ¢ --4 -¢ of 
this Lagrangian. A natural question is whether quantum corrections change this. In other 
words, is (¢) = 0 in the full theory? If not, the Z2 symmetry under ¢ --4 -¢ of the 
classical Lagrangian is spontaneously broken. The question is particularly intriguing in 
the case when m 2 = 0, where an infinitesimal shift that makes m 2 < 0 would destabilize 
the system. The IPI effective action is exactly what we need to find out what happens at the 
quantum level: since r'[ (¢)] = 0, we just need to see if r'[O] = O. 
Following the general method outlined in the previous section, we shift ¢ --4 ¢b + ¢ and 
drop the tadpoles to get 
ei r[4>b) = eiJ d4x (-~4>bD4>b-V[4>b)) r D¢ ei J d4x( - ~¢D¢- H2V"(4>b)-:h4>3V'II(4>b)+"') 
Jrestr. 
(34.42) 
For a general potential, we will never be able to evaluate this path integral. However, we 
can easily evaluate it at I-loop order. I-loop means one ¢-loop (since ¢b does not propa-
gate) with an arbitrary number of external ¢b fields, as in Eq. (34.39). In the language of 
Chapter 33, we want to compute the ¢ propagator in terms of a background ¢b and close 
the ends of the propagator together to form a loop. 
Technically, I-loop means next-to-Ieading order in an expansion in n. Since n = 1, this 
loop expansion generically makes no sense. However, when there is a small coupling, then 
2-100p graphs will be suppressed by some coupling compared to l-loop graphs with the 
same number of external ¢b legs. Thus, the loop expansion in background-field calculations 
is not any less justified than in ordinary perturbation theory. Nevertheless, we will have to 
check for self-consistency to see that the quantum corrections are not large. 
Since none of the ¢3 or higher vertices can contribute at I-loop, we can truncate to 
quadratic order in ¢ giving 
ei r[4>bl = ei J d
4
x( -~4>bD4>b - V[4>b)) J

(34.43) 

34.2 Background scalar fields 
where the "restr." subscript has been dropped since the only diagrams left have one closed 
loop and are IP!. Now we have reduced our problem to a Gaussian integral, which we can 
do exactly: 
eif'[<Pb] = const. x eiJ d4x( -HbD<pb-V[<Pb]) 
1 
Jdet(D + V"[<,Db]) 
(34.44) 
So the calculation is reduced to evaluating this functional determinant. Using the standard 
tricks (see Chapter 33), we have r[<,D] = J d4x( -~<,DbD<,Db - V[<,Db]) + ~r[<,Db], where 
. 
1 
1 
Z~r[<,Db] = In 
+ const. = --tr In(D + V"(<,Db)) + const. (34.45) 
Jdet(D + V"(<,Db)) 
2 
Pulling out a <,Db-independent integral over In 0 we can make the logarithm dimensionless. 
Then, writing the trace as a d4x integral (see Chapters 30 or 33), we have 
i~r[<,Db] = -~ J 
d4x(xlln (1 + VI~<,Db]) Ix) + const. 
(34.46) 
Unfortunately, unless <,Db is constant, this integral is very hard to evaluate. So let us 
assume <,Db is constant. Then V" (<,Db) becomes just a function rather than a functional. For 
example, if V (<,D) = ~m2<,D2 + -ir<,D4 then V"(<,Db) = m 2 + %<,D~. This motivates us to think 
of V"(<,Db) as an effective mass-squared, and thus we define m;ff(<,Db) == V"(<,Db), often 
leaving the dependence of meff on <,Db implicit. 
Inserting a complete set of momentum states, we find 
(34.47) 
The J d4x just gives VT, which allows us to write ~r [<,Db] = 
-VT~Veff(<,Db), with 
Veff( <,Db) what we call the effective potential. The d4 k integral is very badly divergent. 
Since this is just a scalar field theory, nothing goes wrong if we Wick rotate k 2 ----+ - k1 
and impose a hard cutoff kE < A. Then we get 
~r[<,Db] = - VT 27f24 fA dkE k~ In (1 + mk;ff) + const.

with Cl, C2 and C3 some uninteresting, regulator-dependent but <,Db-independent, divergent 
constants (e.g. C2 = 64~2 A 2 with the hard cutoff used above). 
As usual, the various divergences can be removed through renormalization with the 
physics content residing in the logarithmic term. Adding counterterms in the usual way 
lets us write

with om, 0/\ and 0,), assumed to start at O(A~). Then m;ff(¢) = V"(¢) = m~ + 4}:¢2 + 
O(A~) and the effective action is 
(34.51) 
Now we need renormalization conditions to fix 0/\, Om and 0,),. 
To address the question of whether the Z2 symmetry of the classical Lagrangian is spon-
taneously broken for mR = 0 we need to define mR = 0 carefully. Normally we might 
define mR as the mass of ¢. Such a definition is problematic in the current case since it 
presupposes that ¢ is a physical degree of freedom with positive m~, which is what We 
are trying to check. For a classical potential, V(¢) = A + ~2 ¢2 + -£r¢4, the mass can 
be determined by m 2 = V"(O). Thus, an alternative to asking that a mass vanish is that 
V:k(O) = O. We therefore take m~ = V:fr(O) = 0 as one renormalization condition. Sim-
ilarly, A = 0 classically can be written as V(O) = 0, so we set AR = Veff(O) = 0, which 
sets a second renormalization condition. For AR, the analogous renormalization condition 
V:~'(O) = AR does not work, since the effective potential is singUlar at ¢ = 0 (when 
mR = 0). Instead, we can set V:~' (¢ R) = AR for some fixed (but arbitrary) scale ¢ R. 
Usingm~ = V:fr(O) = AR = Veff(O) and V:~'(¢R) = AR, solving for the counterterms, 
and plugging in gives 
V;:ff(¢) = -q} AR + --.!l. In -

which is known as the Coleman-Weinberg potential [Coleman and Weinberg, 1973]. 
Now let us return to our original question: Is (¢) = 0 or not? It seems from Eq. (34.52) 
that the minimum is now not at zero, but V' ( (¢)) = 0 when 
(34.53) 
Unfortunately, since 332H2 ~ 105 this is a large logarithm: IAR In ~ 
I » l. Thus, one 
expects higher-order terms in the background-field calculation (such as a ¢4 A~ In21i cor-
rection to V (¢ ) to be at least as important as the term we calculated. We cannot proceed 
further without resumming these large logarithms. 
34.2.2 Resummation of large logarithms 
In order to resum the large logarithms in the effective potential, it is useful to think about 
other equivalent ways that the potential can be calculated. First, it is possible, and almost as 
easy, to compute the effective potential by summing the relevant Feynman diagrams. For 

34.2 Background scalar fields 
simplicity, let us specialize to the massless theory with £ = _1 ¢O¢ -
A4~ ¢4. Since a con-

stant background field carries zero momentum, a I-loop diagram with n background fields 
is the same as a scalar loop with no external fields multiplied by a factor of (-~)...R¢~r. 
For example, with 10 external ¢b, the loop is 
= 
(34.54) 
with the 110 a symmetry factor (rotation and reflection). This diagram is badly IR divergent; 
and diagrams with more external fields are even more IR divergent. However, summing all 
the diagrams at the integrand level, we find

which is now IR finite. Rotating to Euclidean space and integrating up to k E < A as before, 
(34.56) 
we reproduce Eq. (34.48) with m;ff = 
~¢~. This approach, which is how Coleman and 
Weinberg originally calculated their potential, illustrates that ¢b acts as an IR cutoff on 
diagrams such as Eq. (34.54). 
Next we observe that the entire logarithmic term in the Coleman-Weinberg potential 
could have been extracted from the 4-point interaction alone. If we calculate the 4-point 
amplitude for non-zero external momenta, we find

to be some scale near Q == (stU)1/6 to minimize the logarithms. Then,

with M4(P,)

reproduced by 
(34.59) 
with ¢ R replacing p,. This implies that we can resum the large logarithms in Veff ( ¢) 
by resumming the large logs of p, in M 4 , which we can do by running A with the 
renormalization group. 
As discussed in Chapter 23, the renormalization group works by making the scale p, at 
which AR is defined arbitrary. Thus, we replace AR --> A(p,) to get 
(34.60) 
Since M4 (Q) is independent of p" we have 
(34.61) 
which is the J -loop ROE for A. We can solve this equation to find a result much like the

This implies that the resummed Coleman-Weinberg potential in the leading-log approxi-
mation is 
(34.63) 
Expanding out to order A~ reproduces the large logarithm of Eq. (34.52). 
Note that more generally we would also need to include the wavefunction renormal-
ization factor "/ in the running of A(p,). The Callan-Symanzik equation, Eq. (23.76), 
implies 
(p, :p, + (3 :A + 2"/) M 4 = o. 
(34.64) 
For £ = -!¢O¢ -
-.fr¢4 we find "/ = O(A4) , and so Eq. (34.64) with Eq. (34.57) gives 
Eq. (34.61) up to terms of higher order in A. At 2-loops and higher in this theory, the 
resummed effective potential is given by Veff(¢) = ir¢(p,)4A(p,) with p, = ¢, where the 
running of ¢ must be included as well. 
34.2.3 Higgs effective potential 
An important application of the Coleman-Weinberg approach is to the effective potential 
for the Standard Model Higgs boson. It will let us answer the very important question: 
Is the Standard ModeJ vacuum stable? If not, there must be physics beyond the standard 
model coming in to make it stable. 

34.2 Background scalar fields 
The most important contribution to the Higgs effective potential is from the top quark, 
since its Yukawa coupling is close to one. Including just the Higgs and the top quark, the 
relevant part of the electroweak Lagrangian from Chapter 29 is 
(34.65) 
where H is the Higgs doublet, Q is the lefthanded toplbottom quark doublet, and tR is 
the righthanded top quark. Expanding H = ~ (v: h) with v = ~ = 247 Ge V 
generates a canonically normalized physical Higgs scalar h with mass mh = v'2m. In this 
normalization we can read off that yt = v'2rr;,' ~ 0.93. 
You can show in Problem 34.2 that the contribution to the effective potential from a Dirac 
fermion with Yukawa coupling Y ¢1jJ?jJ is .0, Veff( ¢) = -
16~2 y4¢41n -;Ji. More generally, 
a useful formula for general contributions is

mZ,eff(¢) 
Veff ¢ = V ¢ + ~ -1 
'641f 2 mi,eff ¢ In

' 
, 
(34.66) 
where (_1)25 i is -1 for a fermion and 1 for a boson, n~ is the number of degrees of 
freedom (e.g. 12 for a colored Dirac spinor and 1 for a neutral scalar) and mi,eff(¢) is the 
¢-dependent mass, e.g. mi,eff = Y ¢ for a fermion or m;,eff = V" (¢) for the scalar itself. 
You can prove this general formula in Problem 34.2. 
Using Eq. (34.66) for the top-quark contribution to the effective potential, the effective 
mass is mt,eff = Jz yth, while for the Higgs, m~,eff = -m2 + 3)"h2 . Therefore, 
The factor of 12 in the top contribution comes from the 3 colors times 4 components of 
a Dirac spinor. We have chosen hR = v since this is the scale where we know the Higgs 
potential should be well approximated by its classical form. 
Now let us explore some of the physics of this potential. As long as h rv v rv m the 
logarithmic terms have little effect. However, at large values of h, the coefficient of h4 in 
the potential can get significant corrections. Taking the h » v limit, we get

(34.68) 
For our vacuum to be absolutely stable, this potential should be positive for all h, which 
2 
means the coefficient of the logarithm should be positive. Using).. = ~, yt = v'2~ 
and the MS mass for the top quark, mt = 163 GeV, we find absolute stability holds if 
mh > 247.7 GeY. This bound assumes the potential can be trusted for all h; however, 
for mh = 247.7 GeV, the potential only goes negative at a value well above the Planck 
scale where quantum gravity becomes strong. Asking that the potential be positive up to 
Mp1 ~ 1019 GeV gives a weaker bound, mh > 221 GeY. For h ;S M p1 , we do not have 
to worry about quantum gravity; however, we do have to worry about large logarithms. 
749

Background fields 
....... ----------------------------------------------------
Indeed, 64~2 In ~ 
= 0.12, which is comparable to i R::i 0.10 (for mh R::i 221 GeV) and 
so we cannot trust our bound without resumming the effective potential. 
To get a more accurate instability bound, one should also include contributions frorn 
gauge bosons, which are smaller than the top contribution, but not unimportant. Including 
the full 2-loop effective potential in the Standard Model and performing resummation at 
3-100p order, the absolute stability bound becomes [Degrassi et al., 2012] 
mh> 129.4 GeV ± 1.8 GeV. 
(34.69) 
In other words, if mh < 125.8 GeV we are 95% confident that our patch of the universe 
will eventually tunnel into a more stable vacuum. To refine this bound, one can ask not 
that our vacuum be absolutely stable, but that it be stable only for a Hubble time ( R::i 1010 
years). This weakens the bound by a few GeY. That the real Higgs boson mass is close to 
the bound of instability is an intriguing and unexplained fact. 
34.2.4 Scalar QED 
As a final example with background scalar fields, consider the effective potential in scalar 
QED. In this case we will find that the effective potential is not gauge invariant although 
some simple physical predictions coming from it are. 
We start with the Lagrangian

with DJ.L¢ = 0J.L¢ + ieAJ.L¢. For m 2 < 0, this is the Abelian Higgs model, studied 
in Section 28.3.1. Note that we have chosen normalization conventions so that expanding 
¢ = ¢l + i¢2 provides canonical normalization for the real fields ¢l and ¢2. In this way, 
the effective potential which is only a function of ¢ = J ¢i + ¢~ will have the canonical 
normalization for a real scalar field. 
Now, we want to ask whether mR = 0, meaning V:MO) = 0, leads to (¢) "lOin the 
quantum theory. We leave most of the details ofthe calculation in this case to Problem 34.3. 
The result of I-loop graphs involving ¢ or AJ.L is an effective potential

(34.71) 
Here we have chosen the same renormalization conditions as in Section 34.2.l: V(O) = 0, 
V"(O) = 0 and Villi (¢R) = AR (how eR is defined is irrelevant at this order). 
The first important thing to notice is that the potential in this case is not gauge invariant. 
One way to see why this is so is to recall that only IPI graphs are included in an effective 
potential. Thus, wavefunction renormalization graphs such as 
~ 
~ 
(34.72) 

34.2 Background scalar fields 
which would be included in an S-matrix calculation are simply discarded [Jackiw, 1974]. 
Another way to see the origin of the gauge dependence is to recall that through the 
Legendre-transform derivation of the effective action, we learned that the effective poten-
tial away from ¢ = (¢) is the potential in the presence of a non-zero external current. 
However, if this current J(x) is gauge invariant, then the interaction -J(x )¢(x) used to 
perform the Legendre transform is not gauge invariant, since ¢ transforms. Despite the 
gauge dependence of the effective potential, we expect physical quantities computed from 
Verr should be gauge invariant. We will now see how this can happen. 
The vacuum expectation value of ¢, given by VI ( (¢)) = 0, is where

(¢)2

8~2 AR 
In--~----
¢~ 
3 
ge~' 
(34.74) 
In particular, if we choose ¢R = (¢), meaning we define AR == V"" ((¢)), then AR = 
8~2 e~. Therefore, our assumption e~ ~ AR « 1 is proven self-consistent and there are 
no large logarithms. With the choice AR = 8~2 e~ we find 
(34.75) 
By the way, in defining AR in terms of (¢) we are trading a dimensionless parameter 
for a dimensionful one. In fact, the term dimensional transmutation, which we have used 
to describe running couplings in Chapter 23, originated from the paper of Coleman and 
Weinberg where the relation AR = 
8~2 e~ was first derived [Coleman and Weinberg, 1973]. 
Although we have shown that our calculation is self-consistent, we have yet to make any 
physical predictions. To do so, consider the spectrum in the spontaneously broken theory. 
When (¢) i= 0, the U(1) of the classical Lagrangian is broken. As in the Abelian Higgs 
model from Section 28.3.1, one of the real components of ¢ remains in the spectrum, with 
mass m~ = V" ((¢)) = ~ 
(¢)2. The other component of ¢ is eaten by the photon. The 
photon's mass is given by the relation m't,r = e~ (¢)2 as in Eq. (28.45). Thus, we find a 
prediction 
(34.76) 
independent of the only dimensionful scale (¢) (or equivalently, independent of AR). 
This scalar to vector mass ratio is a gauge-invariant prediction, despite the gauge depen-
dence of the effective potential. In the regime where predictions can be trusted, the 
~-dependent part of the potential only had effects at higher order in perturbation theory. 
More specifically, since AR = 
8~2 e~, the ~e~AR term in Eq. (34.71) could be canceled by 
something such as ~e~ appearing at 2-100ps. The 2-100p calculation has been done [Kang, 
1974]. Indeed, terms such as ~e~ do appear and the appropriate cancellations do happen

The lesson is that, although the effective potential itself is gauge dependent, physical pre-
dictions made using the IPI effective action formalism should still be gauge independent. 
We will see another example of how this can happen in Section 34.3.3 below. 
34.3 Background gauge fields 
An important application of effective actions and background fields is to non-Abelian 
gauge theories. In this case, we want to integrate out the fluctuations A~ for a fixed back-
ground field A~ (we put a tilde on the background field rather than a b subscript as above 
to avoid confusion with SU(N) indices). In this case, we will not assume the background 
field is constant, so that the vertices in r[A~l will represent the fulllPI graphs. To be able 
to calculate anything, we will have to work to fixed order in the coupling constant 9 (in 
contrast to the Coleman-Weinberg calculation, which assumed constant background fields 
and was valid to all orders in coupling constants but to fixed order in n). Effectively, we will 
just be doing normal perturbation theory in a new language. As we will see, this approach 
makes some calculations simpler, such as the calculation of the QCD ,B-function. 
Substituting A~ --t A~ + A~ in the Yang-Mills field strength leads to 
F:v --t allA~ - avA~ + allA~ - avA~ + gr
bc (AtA~ + AtA~ + AtA~ + AtA~ ) 
= F:v + jjllA~ - jjvA~ + grbc AtA~, 
(34.77) 
where F;v = allA~ - avA~ + grbc AtA~ is the field strength for the background field 
and 
(34.78) 
is a derivative that is covariant with respect to the background-field gauge tranSfOllllations. 
Then the Lagrangian 
L BP = -~ (F:v + jjllA~ - jjvA~ + gr
bc AtA~ r 
(34.79) 
is invariant under 
(34.80) 
Since LBP is symmetric in A~ <-+ A~, it is also invariant under 
(34.81) 
Unfortunately, we cannot keep both symmetries manifest at the same time. The advantaEe 
of keeping gauge invariance with respect to the background field manifest is that, since All 

34.3 Background gauge fields 
is not dynamical, we do not need its propagator and do not have to gauge-fix. That is, we 
can keep background-field gauge invariance manifest throughout the calculation. 
Now let us gauge-fix AIL through the Faddeev-Popov procedure. We can of course go to 
the usual one-parameter family of covariant gauges by adding 
(34.82) 
to LBF. This set of gauges is not ideal for background-field calculations, since it breaks all 
of the gauge symmetry. Instead, we will choose a different family of gauges corresponding 
to the condition DILAIL = 0 (instead of 0ILAIL = 0). Such a gauge-fixing breaks gauge 
invariance for the propagating AIL' but keeps manifest the gauge symmetry with respect to 
Aw Working out the Faddeev-Popov P!ocedure, as in Section 25.4, the result is what one 
would expect, Eq. (34.82) with OIL ~ Dw The Lagrangian is 
LBFG = LBF -
.2:,.(DILA~)2 + (DILca) (DILca) + grbC(DILca)A~cc. 
2~ 
(34.83) 
Here the ghosts ca , anti-ghosts ca and A~ all transform as adjoints under the gauge sym-
metry with respect to AIL and so the background gauge invariance is still exact. This type of 
gauge-fixing is called background-field gauge. It is really a family of gauges parametrized 
by [. Other choices of gauge are possible, as we discuss in Section 34.3.3. 
34.3.1 Renormalization 
A compelling virtue of the background-field method is that renormalization is drastically 
simpler than in regular non-Abelian gauge theories. For example, since the quantum fields 
AIL and c only appear in loops, it is useless to renormalize them: their renorrnalization fac-
tors would always cancel between vertices and propagators. We do need to renormalize 
the background gauge field AIL' which we do with AIL = 
VZ;;A~, and also its self-
interactions. Another way to see why only the background fields need renorrnalization 
is that the divergences from loops of AIL will appear as divergences in the effective action, 
which is a functional of only the background fields. Thus, these divergences can only be 
removed by renormalizing the background fields and their interactions. 
Renormalization is simplest in background-field gauge where the gauge invariance 
associated with the background field is unbroken. Thus, if the regulator respects gauge 
invariance, the effective action must be gauge invariant as well, and there are even fewer 
counterterms required. For example, at tree-level, Leff [A] = -
~ (F:,,)2. At I-loop, pos-
sible divergences can only be removed by renormalizing fields in the tree-level effective 
Lagrangian. Since 
(34.84) 
753 

754 
Background fields 
---
the only way for gauge invariance to be preserved is if ZA3 = Z3 and Z A4 = Z3. This 
is in contrast to the ordinary renormalization of non-Abelian gauge theories discussed in 
Chapter 26, where we could only show that Z A3 / Z3 = j Z A4 / Z3' Indeed, this ratio was 
1 9
2 
not 1, but equal:? 1 - E :g~2 C A (~ + 3) at I-loop. 
To see why Z A3 = Z3 and Z A4 = Z3 in another way, consider that at I-loop in 
dimensional regularization the bare 1-loop effective Lagrangian must have the form 
-
1-
c-
2 
0 
Lcff [A] = -"4 (F:,,)2 + ~(F:J + O(E ) 
(34.85) 
for some number c. If divergences appeared in any other form, the theory would not be 
gauge invariant or not be renormalizable. Therefore, we must be able to remove the diver_ 
gence by renormalizing i':v through the renormalization of AI" only and there cannot be 
any divergence in ZA3/Z3 or ZA4{Z3. _ 
So in background-field gauge, 63 =: Z3 - 1 must equal 6 A3 = Z A3 - l. Thus, the 
formula for the I-loop ,6-function from Eq. (26.94) simplifies to 
We can therefore extract the ,6-function from the gluon 2-point function alone - we 
will not have to compute any 3-point loops. Moreover, since the result should be the 
same ,6-function as we computed in Chapter 26, 83 cannot be ~ dependent. Recall from ' 
Section 26.5.3 that 63 = ~(1~:2)el- ~)CA and OA3 = ~(~)e; -
~~)CA. In 
background-field gauge, we therefore expect 83 = ~ (1~:2 ) (232 )C A- In particular, 83 must 
itself be independent of the parameter ~ of the background-field gauges. We will now 
verify this explicitly. 
34.3.2 Background-field Feynman graphs 
One approach to performing background-field calculations is using path integrals and func-
tional determinants. This method was discussed in Section 34.2.1. To see how it works 
for background-gauge fields, see [Peskin and Schroeder, 1995, Section 16.6]. For the ,6-
function calculation, it is perhaps more enlightening to see how the relevant I-loop graphs 
differ from what we computed in Chapter 26. Thus, we proceed following [Abbott, 1982], 
deriving the Feynman rules and computing the loops explicitly. 
The Feynman rules are derived from Eq. (34.83). The quantum-field propagator to zeroth 
order in the background field is just the ordinary RE gauge propagator with ~ replacing~:

The vertices involving quantum fields are all identical to those in non-Abelian gauge

contribute to IP! diagrams, so they can be ignored. 
To extract the QCD ,B-function, we will only need the divergent parts of the l-loop

in agreement with what we found in Chapter 26 (the C A term in Eq. (26.93)). 
34.3.3 Gauge dependence 
The calculation of the QCD ,6-function using the background-field method is clearly easier 
than the calculation we did in Chapter 26 since it involves fewer diagrams. In the traditional 
way of doing the calculation, we needed not just the vacuum polarization graphs, but also 
corrections to a vertex. For example, in Chapter 26, we used 02, 03 and 01 (from the quark 
and gluon field strength renormalizations and the q.Jq vertex), or we could have used 03 and 
o 
A 3, with 0 A 3 coming from gluon 3-point function (or we could have used the ghost vertex 
or the 4-point QCD vertex). Since 3- and 4-point Feynman diagrams are more complicated 
than 2-point diagrams, not only does the background-field method require fewer graphs, 
but the most complicated graphs are avoided. 
While the background-field advantage may not seem so important for the I-loop ,6-
function, consider the 2-100p or 3-100p ,6-function. There, reducing the number and 
complexity of the graphs required is enormously beneficial. Or consider a more com-
plicated theory, such as quantum gravity. In perturbative quantum gravity, there are an 
enormous number of interactions and graphs that need to be considered even for the 
I-loop running of G N. The background-field method, which keeps a copy of general coor-
dinate invariance manifest, makes the study of the renormalization in this theory much 
simpler ['t Hooft and Veltman, 1974]. 
757 

758 
Background fields 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The background-field method is important for conceptual reasons as well. One important 
application is to renormalizability. To show non-Abelian gauge theories are renormaliz_ 
able, we need to show that all the infinities can be reabsorbed into coupling and field 
strength renormalizations of terms present in the original action. The reason the proof is 
difficult is because gauge invariance has to be broken to compute the propagator, and there_ 
fore non-gauge-invariant divergences cannot be forbidden on gauge-symmetry grounds 
alone (one needs tools such as BRST invariance ~ r the prooO. For example, a term such 
as (Jabc AtA~) 2 is not forbidden. With the background-field mCLh d inc backgr und-
field gauge invariance is manifest at every lep. and ince the regulator re peer. Oauge 
invariance, it is impossible for a non-gauge-invariant lerm to be generated in the effective 
action. 
Background-field gauge is a natural gauge to pick since it preserves background gauge 
invariance. However, physical predictions should come out the same even if we choose 
a less natural gauge for which background-field gauge invmiance is explicitly broken. It 
is instructive to see how this actually happens. Recall that background-field gauge corre-
sponds to using a gauge-fixing term of the form ,C~:G = - 2 ~ (15 I-'A~? + ghosts, as in 
Eq. (34.83). From this, we found the I-loop effective Lagrangian in Eq. (34.102). What 
would happen if we used ~fix = (8I-'A~)2 + ghosts as in Eq. (34.82) instead? This gauge-
fixing is independent of AI-' and explicitly breaks background gauge invariance. In this 
case, the divergent part of the I-loop effective action is [Grism'u et al., 1975]

At first glance, this seems troubling, since the coupling must now be renormalized differ-
ently in the 4-point vertex and 3-point vertices to cancel the ~ poles. To see in what way this 
effective Lagrangian is equivalent to Eq. (34.1 02), recall that the effective action is only 
to be used for classical computations. In particular, for S-matrix elements, the background 
field states are on-shell. Then, substituting the identity

into Eq. (34.104), dropping the~otal derivative term and the term that vanishes on-shell 
(using the equations of motion DI-'F:v = 0)

reinforces what we found in Section 34.2.4: although the effective action itself is gauge 
dependent and unphysical, physical prediclions cOOlin' from the err clive action can still 
be gauge invariant.

Heavy-quark physics 
There are only six quarks. Three of them (up, down and strange) are light with masses 
mq .:S AQCD . Hadrons containing these quark only for example the pion and kaons an

Chiral Lagrangian (Chapter 28), which is a low-energy effective theory, peJ'lurbative when 
4:F~ and 4';l are small, with E a typical energy scale and 41fF;r '" 1200 MeV. The

mesons). Is there allY way to study charm and bottom physics in pertUl'bation theory? Ye ,

The heavy-quark limit presents a picture of heavy me on qualitatively similar [0 the 
hydrogen atom. Consider, for example, a B me, n that compri e a heavy b quark and a 
light valence antiquark (u or d). This is similar to how a hydrogen atom compri c a heavy 
proton and a light electron. Just as the proton is a talic ource f Coulomb potentia] in the 
Schrodinger equation, the b quark acts as a static ource for gluons. Unfortunately beca.tl e 
QCD is strongly coupled at low energies, the Coulomb potential i a bad approximation

qualitative picture is to think of a B meson a being like a proton but wi th the electron

For example, the spin states of a heavy-light meson 
ucb as a bfi bound late are t 0 
~ = 0 EJj 1, with the spin-O state called the B me on and the pin-I triplet called the B$. 
The mass difference between these is analogou to the energy plitling between the 
and 
P states of the hydrogen atom: it is 0 at leading order. In the hydrogen atom, the splitting 
between Sand P is due to magnetic moment interactions. If the proton is at rest (as it is in 
the mp -> 00 limit), it only produces an electric field. Therefore, the / P 'plilling mu t be 
suppressed by at least a factor of E /mp with E '" 10 cV lhe binding energy. To Jeading 
order in AQCD/mb the dynamics of a B meson is imilarly independent of pin, which 
is why Band B* are degenerate to leading order. Thi i known as heavy-quark spin

the spin § and the magnetic field ii, where fJ. is the magnetic moment of the heavy quark

Experimentally, m B = 5325 MeV and mB = 5279 :MeV and their difference 44 :MeV is 
consistent with this expectation. 
In addition to the spin symmetry, bottom and charm quark physics also simplifies due 
to a flavor symmetry. This is the analog of the fact that the nucleus of a hydrogen atom or 
a deuteron look the same to the electron. In the rest frame of the heavy quark, the hadron 
can be thought of as just the quark, sitting there. If mQ = 00 the quark cannot move. 
In fact, in this limit, the quark just acts as a source for gluons. This leads to a heavy-
quark flavor symmetry: the dynamics is independent ofthe flavor ofthe quark, to leading 
order in mQ 1 . This symmetry provides very strong constraints on the physics of heavy 
hadrons. For example, the D mesons should satisfy the same parametrization as in Eqs. 
(35.1) and (35.2) with mb ----) me: 
(35.4) 
(35.5) 
This implies that 
(35.6) 
So now we get a prediction for the masses-squared that is accurate up to mQ1 corrections, 
a stronger result than that in Eq. (35.3). In particular, using mE, mB' and mD = 1869 
MeV, this equation predicts that mD* = 1993 MeV. The experimental value is m D 
2010 MeV, so the heavy-quark limit prediction is off by only 0.8%. 
The momentum of a hadron containing a heavy quark can be written as 
(35.7) 
where v'" is the hadron's 4-velocity, normalized to v 2 = 1, and k'" « m Q. The key to 
understanding the heavy-quark flavor symmetry is that the brown muck has energies of 
order AQCD. Therefore, fluctuations in the muck do not have enough energy to reorient 
the heavy-quark velocity v'" - the muck can only change k"'. In this chapter, we discuss an 
effective theory for heavy quarks in which v'" is promoted to a conserved quantum number 
of the heavy-quark field. This leads to Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (HQET), a beautiful 
and predictive framework for studying bottom and charmed hadrons. Before introducing

Heavy-quark physics 
---
HQET, we will describe some more consequences of the heavy flavor and spin symmetries 
which can be understood without even introducing the effective Lagrangian. Our presen~ 
tation here will be somewhat brief, emphasizing important results and conceptual point s. 
More details can be found in the classic review [Georgi, 1990] and the texts [Manohar and 
Wise, 2000] and [Grozin, 2004]. 
35.1 Heavy-meson decays 
In this section we discuss how heavy-quark flavor and spin symmetries constrain decay 
rates of heavy mesons. We use the notation m Q to refer the mass of a heavy quark (b Or c) 
and mq to refer to the mass of a light quark (u, d or s). 
35.1.1 Leptonic decays 
First, consider the weak decays of the pseudoscalar mesons B - = (ub) ---> T 
V and 
D+ = (u e) ---> p,+v. As with pions, we define decay constants fB and fD through the 
matrix element of an axial current (see Chapter 28): 
(35.8) 
These definitions correspond to the conventional relativistic normalization, in which 
(35.9) 
and lead to the decay rate 
(35.10) 
and similarly for other leptonic modes. Since m T = 1776 MeV » ml-' = 105 MeV, the 
branching ratio to tauons dominates. The formula for leptonic D+ decays is identical, with 
mB replaced by m D . For D+ decays, the branching ratio to p,+v dominates due to the 
limited phase space for D+ ---> T+V. 
The relativistic normalization is not useful to extract scaling behavior as m Q ---> 00 since 
pO ---> 00. Instead, we should use non-relativistic normalization, with 
nr(B(p')\B(p) ) nr = (21r)3 J3 (iJ - p) = nr{D(P')ID(p)) nr ' 
(35.11) 
You can think of the B or D decay as the bor e quark within the meson annihilating with 
the brown muck, which has the quantum numbers of the light quark. The important point is 
that, in the heavy-quark limit, the muck has no knowledge of the heavy-quark mass. Thus, 
the matrix elements should be mass independent in the heavy-quark limit. Therefore we 
should have 
(35.12) 

35.1 Heavy-meson decays 
where u is some constant related to the brown muck, and V 11- is the velocity. Similarly,

up to A QCD ~ 10% corrections.

(35.14) 
Is Eq. (35.14) actually satisfied to 10%7 We can use the measured rate f(D+ ---) p,+v) 
::::: 2.42 X 10-13 MeV to predict the B ---) TV rate. Using the masses mE- = 5279 MeV 
and mD+ = 1869 MeV, Eq. (35.14) predicts r(B - ---) T-V) = 1.55 x 1O-14 lVleV. The 
current best-measured value is (6.7 ± 1.7) x 10- 14 MeV. Thus Eq. (35.14) is off by a factor 
of 3! So there is not fantastic agreement with current data, to say the least. Another way to 
phrase this is that the values of the decay constants extracted from the decay rates are I D = 
202 MeV and IE = 253 MeV. Their ratio is 1.25, compared to 
(i!;i; = 0.595, so again 
, 
V mE 
the heavy-quark-limit prediction is off by a large factor. This indicates that there must be an 
unusually large power cOlTection; that is, the AQCD term must have a coefficient of order 10 
mD 
or so. Intriguingly, lattice calculations give ID = 197MeV and IE = 1931VleV [Particle 
Data Group (Beringer et aZ.), 2012], whose ratio is only a factor of 2 off from the heavy-
quark limit prediction. The lattice also seems to confirm that there is a large _1_ cOlTection 
mQ 
to the decay constants. 
35.1.2 Exclusive semi-Ieptonic decays 
We can develop a more general view of how the brown muck wavefunctions factorize out of 
the heavy-quark wavefunctions. Let us continue using the decomposition pl1- = mQvl1-+ kl1-
with kl1- ~ AQCD . Then the brown muck in the B or D meson (recallIB) = Ib; muck), 
with its fluctuations of order AQCD , cannot affect the velocity vl1- or the spin sQ of the 
heavy quark. Thus, a general heavy-meson state, for example for a B, can be written as 
(35.15) 
where Sb is the b quark spin, and Sq is the spin of the light quark. Note that the light-quark 
spin is a good quantum number because the B and heavy-quark spins are good quantum 
numbers. Although the muck cannot change V 11- , the muck wavefunction can depend on V 11- • 
This factorization has immediate and important implications, such as the leptonic decay 
rates of B+ and D - discussed above. More generally, to measure properties of heavy 
mesons, we look at their current matrix elements, as we did above for weak decays. We 
are generally interested in couplings to the W bosons, through Jf = Q-y11-PLq, with PL = 
~ (1 - '5), or to photons, which interact through Jt = Q"I1-Q. We are interested in these 
quark currents, since the interaction strength of the W-boson and photon to these currents 
is related to the interaction strength of the equivalent leptonic currents by electroweak 
symmetry. By writing hadronic matrix elements in terms of ClllTents we can factorize off 
763 

764 
Heavy-quark physics 
------------------------------------------------------------------
the calculable electroweak part of the decay and effectively exploit the above factorization. 
For example, an interaction of a B meson with a photon would be determined by 
(BIIJtIB) = (b;VIS~lhl-'blb ; vSb) (muck;vls~lmuck;s~v). 
(35.16) 
In particular, in the limit that Band BI are both at rest with the same spins, then the vector 
current, which is conserved, just picks up the number of b quarks and we get 
(35.17) 
with the 2mB coming from the relativistic normalization. 
When the velocities are not the same, we need to be able to evaluate 
( muck; Vi s~ I muck; Sq v). We can always write 
( muck; Vi s~1 muck; Sqv) = ~Sq S ~ (v, Vi) . 
(35.18) 
First of all, there are only two possible spins for the pseudoscalar meson matrix elements 
so Sq, s~ = ±4 and the amplitude mu t be the same for both by parity. More impOltantly: 
by Lorentz invariance, ~ can nly depend on the combination W = v . v. Quite generally, 
since the muck is independent of the . pin we have 
(35.19) 
where r can be any tensor structure. The function ~(w) is known as an Isgur-Wise func-
tion and is a universal non-perturbative object. Since the Isgur-Wise function just depends 
on the muck wavefunctions, it is the same if we swap out one heavy quark for another and 
if we change the current. In particular, using the non-relativistic normalization, Eq. (35.11), 
and the vector current matrix element (35.17) we find the boundary condition ~(1) = 1. 
As an application, consider the extraction of the CKM element Vcb from data. There are 
a number of ways of measUl1ng Vcb but one of the cleanest is from exclusive decays, such 
as B ---+ D* lv. The rate for such decays can be measured as a function of the velocities v 
and Vi or the Band D* mesons. Working ont all the phase space factors, the result is

(35.21) 
35.2 Heavy-quark effective theory 
We have seen a number of leading-order predictions from the heavy-quark limit. To make 
systematic improvements on these predictions, it is helpful to have an effective field theory 
where the heavy-quark symmetries are exact. 
To derive this effective theory, we begin with the decomposition as in Eq. (35.7): 
(35.22) 
Here vI-' is the 4-velocity with v 2 = 1 and the components of kl-' are assumed to be much 
smaller than mQ. This decomposition is not unique, since we can shift kf.l --> kl-' + 6.kl-' by 
a small amount and vI-' --> vI-' - 6.kl-' / mQ. However, to leading order in m "Q 1 , vI-' is unique 
and this decomposition is well defined. In a hadron, the light quarks and gluons can have 
momenta kl-' '" AQCD , but not much larger, so interactions can only change v by AQCD. 
mQ 
Thus, to order mql, vI-' is a good quantum number of the heavy quark. Thus, we want to 
have an effective theory where quarks CatTY this quantum number, and the conservation of 
heavy-quark velocity is apparent at the level of the Lagrangian. 
Recall from Section 5.2 that to take the non-relativistic limit of a scalar field the-
ory, we rescale the fields by ¢ --> 
~e-imt¢ nr' The e-imt factor is a plane wave 
solution for a particle at rest. For moving particles, we generalize this to the replacement 
¢ --> r.b-
e -imQv,xXv. This change of variables induces 
v2mQ

Heavy-quark physics 
~----,.- ----------------------------------------------------------------
(35.23) 
The 2~Q term is subleading as mQ ---> 00 and can be dropped. Thus, the Heavy-Scalar 
Effective Theory Lagrangian at leading power is simply 
(35.24) 
To see how to generalize to the spinor case, let us take the heavy-scalar limit a dif-
ferent way. Just as e- imQv,x is the plane wave solution for a particle, eimQv,x is the 
plane wave solution for an antiparticle. In the heavy-scalar limit, pair production is sup_ 
pressed and we should be able to integrate the antiparticle out. To do this, we Write 
¢ = virn
Q e- imQv,x(Xv + Xv), where 
(35 .25) 
(35.26) 
Then, 
£ = IDM¢12 - m~I¢12 = X~iv' DXv - Xv(iv· D + 2mQ)Xv + 0(_1_). 
(35.27) 
mQ 
Thus, in deriving Eq. (35.24) we are removing the antiparticle field from the Lagrangian. 
For the spinor case, note that when pM = mQvM exactly, the Dirac equation for a heavy 
quark, tt/J = mQ'l/J, implies 
(1 - p)'l/J = O. 
Thus, we decompose the spinor field as 
where 
'l/J (x) = 'l/Jv(x) + iiv (x), 
1+p 
'l/Jv(x) = -2-1/J...x), 
-
1- P 
'l/Jv(x) = -2-1/J...x). 
(35.28) 
(35.29) 
(35.30) 
In the heavy-quark limit iiv(x) ::::J 0 since Eq. (35.28) holds. Thus, heavy-quark effective 
theory is defined by integrating the components -0v of'l/J out of the theory. This can be done 
systematically in powers of m c;/ . 
Setting -0v = 0 gives the HQET Lagrangian at leading power. It amounts to replacing 
(35.31) 
in analogy with ¢ ---> e-imQv,x Xv in the scalar case. Inserting this replacement into the 
QeD Lagrangian gives 

35.2 Heavy-quark effective theory 
We can then anticommute the Dirac matrices to get 
if (iI/J - m Q) 'ljJ --+ i Q1J v . D 1 + P Q 1J , 
2 
(35.33) 
which is independent of m Q as expected. Including the gluon and light quarks, the full 
leading-order HQET Lagrangian is then 
where q are light quarks and F:v is the gluon field strength. The HQET Lagrangian at 
sub leading power is discussed in Section 35.4. 
Note that the field Q1J has a label v, which is the velocity of the heavy quark. This 
velocity is an exactly conserved quantum number in the effective theory, although it is 
only approximately conserved in full QeD. The sum over velocities can be thought of as 
a division of the momentum space for the heavy quark into blocks of size AQ CD . Using 
pI-' = m QvJt + kJt , every heavy quark then lives in one of the blocks whose center is mQvJt . 
It is not necessary to indicate precisely how division into blocks is done or to worry about 
the block boundaries. In fact, the sum over v in L HQET is just formal. In practice, one fixes 
the velocity v based on the observable, such as the cross section for B 1J --+ D 1J,lv at a 
given v and v', which is measured. Then only two values of v are relevant and we can 
avoid giving a precise definition to what the sum actually means. 
From the HQET Lagrangian, we can read off that the propagator for the heavy quark is 
~.

35.3 Loops in HQEl 
Now let us turn to an application of HQET: calculating radiative corrections to leading_ 
order heavy-quark prediction, l..I!.fB =/ 
mD , or equivalently, for the relative decay rates 
D 
rnB 
, 
f(B ---4 Tv)jf(D ---4 !Lv). We would like in include loop cOlTections involving virtual 
gluons in these rates. 
The first step is to match to the effective theory. The B meson states in the full theory 
have momentum pJJ. and relativistic normalization, as in Eq. (35.9): 
(35.39) 
In HQET, states have velocities vJJ. and residual momenta kJJ., with non-relativistic 
normalization, as in Eq. (35.11): 
(35.40) 
The relevant current in the full theory is jJJ. = brJJ.u for some tensor fJJ. (in the electroweak 
theory, rJJ. = 
~(l - ,,/shJJ., but the heavy-quark system does not care what rJJ. is). At 
leading order, this CUlTent matches directly onto the equivalent current constructed out of 
HQET fields: 
(35.41) 
with Qv the heavy-quark field for the b, and q representing the light-quark field. The matrix 
element relevant for the leptonic decay is then 
(35.42) 
for some constant a determined by the brown muck. This is the same as Eq. (35.l2), but 
written with HQET fields. vJJ. is the only vector that can appear in this equation. Note 
that we have taken the residual momentum kJJ. = 0 in B ( v, k), which cOlTesponds to 
defining vJJ. through the momentum of the B hadron as pJJ. = mEvJJ. exactly. The formula 
l..I!.fB = 
fiiil2 then follows, as in Section 35.1.1. 
D 
V mE 
Now that we have an effective theory which reproduces ffB = Jm D at leading order, 
D 
mB 
we can consider perturbative corrections to this prediction. The dominant cOlTections in 
the limit where mb » me » AQCD are large logarithms of the form (as ln~ )n . These 
corrections can be resumrned in HQET through the renormalization group evolution of 
OJJ.. In particular, for B decays, this operator should be evaluated at mE, while for the D 
decays it should be evaluated at mD . Note that the equivalent current in full QeD does not 
run, because it is conserved. So one needs HQET to calculate this radiative effect through 
the renonnalization group. 

35.3 Loops in HQET 
35.3.1 Renormalization of HQEl 
To resum large logarithms through the running of 0"' we follow the same approach used 
to resum large logarithms in the 4-Fermi theory in Section 31.3 (see also Chapter 23). The 
first step is to renormalize the HQET Lagrangian. 
The renormalized fields are related to the bare fields as usual: 
1 ° 
q = ,;z:;q , 
(35.43) 
In general, the light-quark field strength renormalization Z2 , which is the same as in QCD, 
could be different from the field strength renormalization Zh for the heavy quark. Inter-
preting the original Lagrangian as comprising bare fields, the renormalized Lagrangian is 
then (ignoring the light-quark masses) 
(35.44) 
To order as , Z2 is the same as in pure QCD, since the light-quark-gluon graphs are the 
same. 
It turns out that Z3 is also the same as in pure QCD. The only possible difference could 
come from vacuum polarization diagrams involving heavy quarks; however, these vanish. 
The technical reason is that the heavy-quark propagators give v.k~ ie v .(p _ik )+ic ' with k the 
loop momentum. This has only two poles in kO (in contrast to the vacuum polarization 
graph in full QeD, which would have four), both of which are below the real kO axis. 
Thus, the integral over k O can be closed in the upper half plane and the loop integral is 
zero. A more physical explanation is that in the heavy-quark limit, heavy particles and 
antiparticles are completely different species: one is a fundamental and the other an anti-
fundamental of SU(3)Qco. Thus, the field Qv that annihilates a heavy quark does not create 
the corresponding antiquark - this is why there is only a single pole in v ' k~ie instead of the 
usual two. The simplest but most boring explanation is that virtual Q Q pairs are suppressed 
and in fact do not contribute at all in the m Q --7 00 limit. 
The remaining quantity to be computed in the HQET Lagrangian is Zh, which comes 
from the heavy-quark self-energy graph. Expanding Zh = 1 + 6h, the contribution of the 
counterterm will be 
(35.45) 
Thus, we expect the loop graph to have a ~ (v . p) divergence.

Heavy-quark physics 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the HQET Feynman rules, the loop is 
iM=

P 
This graph is IR divergent, as was the electron self-energy graph we computed in Chap_ 
ter 18. Since we only want the UV divergence, to extract the anomalous dimension, We 
will simply use the same trick we have used in many places (e.g. Section 26.4) to extract 
the pole from a scaleless integral in dimensional regularization (cf. Eq. (B.49)). Since the 
graph has mass dimension 1, the UV divergence can only be :v . 
p 1~:P, as expected from 
the form of the counterterm, and all we need is the coefficient of this term. 
Taking the derivative with respect to v . p and then setting p = 0 (since the divergence is 
now p independent) gives

The denominators in this graph (and in HQET graphs in general) are not of the form 
(k + X)2 and therefore it will not help to combine them using Feynman parameters. 
Instead, we use Schwinger parameters through the identity

This is the ordinary scaleless, UV- and IR-divergent dimensionally regularized integral we

35.3 Loops in HQET 
35.3.2 Running of O~ 
Now that we have the complete I-loop renormalization factors for the HQET Lagrangian, 
we can tum to the renormalization of the heavy-light current, which we wrote as 
O~ = QvPLq. This is a composite operator and must be renormalized separately from 
its constituent fields. The bare operator O~, bare = Q~rMqO is related to the renormalized 
operator by 0rM b

To find Zo, we can evaluate the correlation function (QIO~lq) at O-momentum (any 
momentum would do, since we are interested in the UV divergence). 
Writing Zo = 1+ 60, the counterterms give 
( ~62 + ~6h - 60 ) irM = (CF~~ - 60 ) rM.

We can simplify this by inserting a Schwinger parameter, through Eq. (35.48), as for the

This is the anomalous dimension for the heavy-light quark operator in HQET at I-loop. 
We are interested in the evolution of the Wilson coefficient C for this operator. We 
matched C = 1 at tree-level. Using d~ (CO) = 0, the Wilson coefficient evolves with 
-r00 Then, the RGE is solved with 
(35.62) 
For the fBI fD comparison, we are interested in the renormalization group effects 
between mM and mD. Including four flavors, /30 = VCA -
~TFnf = 2; and so, with 
11-0 = mb, 11- = me, as(mb) = 0.22 and as (me) = 0.35 we get 
6 
fBvrnB = [as(mb)] -25 = 1.12.

fDJmD 
as (me) 
So there is a 12% correction from this calculation. This does not explain the factor ~ 200% 
by which the ratio is off in the real world. Tbi large correction could be explained by power 
corrections propOltional to AQ CD , which happen to have a numerically large coefficient. 
mD 
This is unfortunate. On the other hand, it is not the effective the ry fau lt that the charm 
quark is so light! 
35.4 Power corrections 
Much of the predictive power of heavy-quark effective theory comes from the way the 
expansion of corrections in inverse powers of the heavy-quark mass is organized. At 
each order in mr:/ there will only be a finite number of operator that can contribute. 
These operators have matrix elements that although unknown are universal, such as the 
( muck; Vi s~ I muck; s~ v) matrix elements involved in the leading-order predictions. In 
some cases mQ 1 corrections vanish and therefore we can make predictions accurate to 
the small percentage level. 
To derive the subleading HQET Lagrangian we have to integrate out the small compo-
nent of the heavy-quark field (as opposed to just setting it to zero as we did in Section 35.2). 
To begin, we project out the large and small components of the heavy-quark field (cf. Eq. 
(35.31»: 
(35.64) 

35.4 Power corrections

where ItP Qv = Qv and l;P Qv = Qv· We then find 
1: = {;(iI/J-mQ)'1jJ = iQvv.DQv-tQv( -iv.D-2mQ)Qv+iQvI/JQv+iQvI/JQv, (35.65) 
with the l;p projectors left implicit. It is helpful to simplify this using 
Di == D'" - v'" (v . D) . 
(35.66) 
Note that if v'" = (1,15) then Di = (0,15) is just the spatial derivatives. Hence, 
(35.67) 
so we can write 
1: = {;(iI/J - mQ)'1jJ = iQv v . DQv +Qv (-iv . D - 2mQ )Qv + iQvI/J 1-Qv + i(JvI/J 1-Qv. 
(35.68) 
The field Qv can be thought of as describing fluctuations in components of the heavy-
quark momentum that leave its velocity fixed. These are massless excitations. The field Qv 
apparently has mass 2mQ. It describes processes in which heavy-quark-heavy-antiquark 
pairs are created. 
Since Qv is heavy, it can be integrated out of the Lagrangian. The easiest way to integrate 
out a field at tree-level is to set it equal to its equations of motion. These are 
(35.69) 
so that 
(35.70) 
The first new term, of order mc/, can be simplified by using the relation (see Eq. 10.106)

so that, including the gluon field strength and light-quark fields,

The Qv 2r::
Q Qv term is a covariant version of the non-relativistic kinetic energy t: of the 
heavy-quark field. Because of the D 1-, it contains only spatial components perpendicular 
to v. The gs Qva !-,vQvF'"v term is the chromomagnetic-moment interaction.

One can u e the subleading HQET Lagrangian co prove a number f powerful reSults 
about hadronic matrix elements. One example is Luke 
theorem, mentioned in Sec_

and Wi e,2000]. Here we di cu

corrections to meson masses. 
35.4.1 Hadron masses 
With the sub leading-power HQET Lagrangian we can now parametrize the mZ/ correc_ 
tions to hadron masses. To calculate masses we can take the expectation value of the HQET 
Hamiltonian. Let us write 
(35.73) 
with Hi '" mot. In the mQ ~ 00 limit, the Hamiltonian is just the heavy-quark rest 
mass, thus H-1 = mQ. The leading-order HQET Lagrangian, Eq. (35.34), leads to a 
Hamiltonian (cf. Eq. (12.63» 
(35.74) 
where (using Eq. (8.26» GQQ I) = ~E2 + lJ2) + ... is the energy density of the gluons, 
whose precise form we d not need. The mQJ HQET Lagrangian has no time derivatives, 
so the mOl Hamiltonian is just the negative of the mol Lagrangian:

where A '" AQCD is a non-perturbative matrix element coming from the light quarks and 
gluons. The prediction for the masses up to order m~ is then that the Band B* masses are 
degenerate, as are the D and D* masses. The splitting comes at order mO 1. 
The mOl corrections contain a kinetic energy term, which is spin independent:

Here, Al '" A~CD is some new non-perturbative parameter. We expect this matrix element

to be negative (so Al > 0) since the kinetic energy ~ 
should be positive.

An important result from these equations is that the difference between the squares 
of meson masses in the same multiplet begins at order mc/ and is flavor indepen-
dent: m~* - m~ = m'b* - m'b + o (m;;-l ). This led to the accurate prediction for mD* 
mentioned in the introduction to this chapter. 
Although two new non-perturbative quantities, A1 and A2, have appeared at sublead-
ing power, only two quantities have appeared. These same quantities contribute to other 
masses, form factors and inclusive decay rates. Thus, one can measure A1 and A2 and use 
those values, along with the computable corrections perturbative in as( mQ), to make many 
quantitive predictions in HQET.

Jets and effective field theory 
--.,.. 
776 
Almost every event of interest at high-energy colliders contains collimated collections of 
particles known as jets. An example event with jets is shown in Figure 36.1. The intuitive 
picture of how jets form is the semi-classical parton shower discussed in Section 32.3: a 
hard parton (quark or gluon) is produced at short distance. As the parton moves out from 
the collision point it radiates gluons; gluons in the radiation field then split into other gluons 
and quark-antiquark pairs. When the collection has spread out over length scales of order 
AQ~D' the quarks and gluons hadronize into color-neutral object. These hadron, then 
decay into stable or metastable particles (mostly pions), which the experiment attempt fO 
measure. Since the radiation is dominantly in the direction of the original hard parton, it 
can be added together to form a jet 4-momentum pj = 2:iEjetpf, which approximates 
the 4-momentum of the hard parton originally produced. For example, if the two jets are 
produced from the decay of a W boson (W -> qq at parton level), the dijet invariant mass 
should be close to the W -boson mass (PJ, + Ph)2 :::::; mW. Thus, jets provide a window 
into short-distance physics. Jets are useful both in Standard Model studies and in searches 
for physics beyond the Standard Model. 
The distribution of jets is described quite accurately by perturbative QCD. For exam-
ple, the 99 -> 99 cross section (computed in Chapter 27), when convolved with PDFs 
(discussed in Chapter 32), gives a contribution to the distribution of dijet events at hadron 
colliders. When all parton channels are included, the theoretical calculations are in excel-
lent agreement with data over a wide range of energies and production angles. The 
theoretical tools necessary for computing the distribution of jets in perturbative QCD have 
been explained in Chapters 25, 26, 27 and 32. 
Event display for a dijet event at the LHC as observed by the ATLAS experiment.

I-T 
Comparison of thrust data from four experiments at LEP to the calculation in perturbative 'iMhf. 
QCD at up to next-to-next-to-Ieading order in Q s . The fixed-order calculation has good 
agreement for 1 - T ;:::, 0.15, but fails to describe the peak region even qualitatively. 
On the other hand, some properties of jets, such as their mass, are not described well 
at any fixed order in as. For example, Figure 36.2 shows the distribution of thrust at LEP 
compared to the perturbative calculation at order as, a~ and a~. Thrust, which is defined 
and discussed in Section 36.1, is one way to characterize how dijet-like an event is. Events 
that produce values of thrust near 1 (the left side of the figure) appear to have two very 
collimated jets. In fact, near T = 1, one can show 1 - T ~ b (m~l + m~,), where 
mJl and mJ2 are the masses of the two jets and Q the center-of-mass energy. Clearly, 
the thrust distribution near T '" 1 is not described well in perturbation theory. In fact, the 
cross section computed in pelturbative QCD blows up as T ---t 1 at any finite order in as. 
One goal of this chapter is to understand the origin of these (unphysical) singularities. To 
reproduce the experimental fact that the distribution goes to zero as T ---t 1 requires the 
resummation of contributions to all orders in as. This resummation will generate distribu-
tions that turn over, qualitatively reproducing the Sudakov peak (the turnover in the data in 
Figure 36.2), and quantitatively improving the agreement between theory and experiment 
(cf. Figure 36.3). 
The singular terms in observables, such as the thrust distribution, are qualitatively similar 
to the large logarithms we have resummed with the renormalization group in previous chap-
ters (see Chapters 16, 23, 26, 31 and 35). In previous applications of the renormalization 
group, the singular terms were of the form (a In x) n with one additional logarithm at each 
subsequent order in a. With jets, there are often two logarilbm . POI' examp:le, in the cumu-
lant thrust distribution, R(T) = 
O"~ot J; 1.;, dT' ~ 1 - CF"S;--ln2(l - T) + .. '. we can . ee 
the double logs explicitly. In Section 32.3, we saw how such Sudako double logarithms 

778 
Jets and effective field theory 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
could be resummed semi-classically with Sudakov factors. Here we will be more systell1_ 
atic about the resummation by developing an effective field theory, called Soft-Collinear 
Effective Theory. This theory will let us resum the double logarithms systematically uSing 
the renormalization group. 
36.1 Event shapes 
Many applications of jet physics require exclusive jet definitions which isolate the radi-
ation going into jets from the rest of the event. On the other hand, certain properties of 
events with jets in them can be studied efficiently through inclusive observables called 
event shapes. Event shapes are, by definition, global observables (meaning tllat all final-
state particles contribute) with no free parameters. They have predominantly been useful 
at e+e- colliders.l 
The most widely studied event shape is called thrust. It is defined as

where the sum is over the 3-momenta Pj of all particles in the event, and the maximum is 
taken over all 3-vectors n with Inl = 1. The direction that maximizes thrust is called the 
thrust axis. Data for thrust from various experiments at LEP are shown in Figure 36.2. 
To develop intuition for thrust, consider the final state of an e+ e-
-7 hadrons event 
in which two very narrow jets are produced. Such pencil-like jets will have T rv 1 since 
Ipj . nl rv IPj I if n points along the direction of the pen il. For Llch event, the thru t 
axis will be close to the jet axis, independently of the jel definition. Jf an event has par-
ticles distributed evenly in all directions then there is no preferred n and (very roughly) 
IPj . iii rv Icos ePj I rv ~ IPj I. Thus, T rv ~ indicates a spherical event. In this way, thrust 
is a quantitative measure of how pencil-like or spherical an event is. In the following we 
will use 
T == 1 - T, 
(36.2) 
which goes to 0 in the dijet configuration and goes to ~ for spherical events. 
Although thrust is measured on metastable particles coming out of e+ e- collisions 
(mostly pions), it can also be computed in perturbation theory using quarks and gluons. 
Let Q = ECM be the center-of-mass energy. For Q » AQCD one expects the shape of the 
event to be frozen-in on time scales much shorter than the hadronization time. Thus, pertur-
bative QCD should provide a reasonable description of thrust up to corrections suppressed 
by some power of A~CD . 
Two event shapes closely related to thrust are heavy jet mass and light jet mass. To 
compute them, first find the thrust axis for a particular event using Eq. (36.1). Then partition 
the particles in the event into two hemispheres by the sign of p . n. Call the sum of the 
I At hadron colliders, the beam remnant makes it impractical to include all final-state radiation in an observable. 
While there are generalizations of e+ e- event shapes to hadronic event shapes, we will not discuss them.

36.1.1 Thrust in perturbative QeD 
Now we will compute thrust at leading order in perturbation theory in QCD. At zeroth 
order, the final state consists of two quarks (e+e- ---; qq). These quarks have massless 
back-to-back 4-vectors, and hence T = O. Thus, the zeroth-order distribution is ~~ = 
aoO(T), where ao = ;;r~ R had and R had = Lealars L~=u Q~ = 3.67 from Eq. (26.24). 
For the O( as) thrust distribution, conventionally called leading order (LO), the partonic 
process is e+e- ---; qqg. The total cross section at order as was calculated in Section 26.3 
using the results from the analogous process in QED computed in Chapter 20. There we 
found that atat = ao(1 + 4~CFas). To compute thrust at LO define s = (Pg + pq)2, 
t = (Pg + pq) 2 and u = (Pq + pq) 2. Since we treatthe quarks as massless, s + t + u = Q2. 
From now on, we set Q = 1 for simplicity, so s + t + u = 1. The differential cross section 
at order as is (see Section 20.1.2)

It is these singular terms that are the main focus of this chapter. 
In the region where r « 1, so that the event has pencil-like dijet kinematics, then r rv rl. 
You can prove this in Problem 36.l. An easy check is that at leading order r = min(s, t , 'U) 
and s, t and 'U are the invariant masses of pairs of partons so r = rl = PH and P L = O. We 
will use the equivalence between 7 and 71 in the singular limit in Sections 36.5.2 and 36.6. 
36.2 Power counting 
Our first task is to understand the origin of the singularities in the distribution of jet mass 
and related jet properties. To calculate jet mass in QCD, or to measure it, one needs a jet 
definition (for example, Sterman-Weinberg jets, discussed in Section 20.2). For any given 
jet definition, the distribution of the jet mass can be written in the form

(36.9) 
where "sing" refers to the part of the distribution that is singular as m 2 ---> O. The part 
labeled "non-sing" is regular as m 2 ---> O. For example, the singular part of the thrust dis-
tribution at leading order is shown in Eq. (36.8). The singular terms dominate the behavior 
of the di tribntion a l mall m 2 (or small 7 in the thrust ca e). Our approach will be to 
calculate these term t all order in a using effective field Lheory methods. We can add 
in the non- ingular part to the r ummed ingular di tribution by matching to perturbative 
QCD order-by-order in as. 

36.2 Power counting 
To calculate the singular part of d:2 we need an expansion paramater ,\ (the analog of 
F;;l in the Chiral Lagrangian, mc/ in HQET or mn} in the4-Fermi theory). A natural 
choice is the ratio of the jet mass m to scale Q, ,\ = 'B. In practice, it is often easier 
to use an expansion parameter that is inclusive, meaning that it gets a contribution from 
every observed hadronic particle in an event, rather than exclusive, like a jet mass, where 
only particles within the jet contribute. Examples of observables and inclusive expansion 
parameters are 
• Event shapes at e+e- collisions (see Section 36.l). We can take ,\ = T = 1 - T for 
thrust'\ = PH for heavy jet mass. 
• Deep inelastic scattering: e-p+ ----) e- X. Recall from Chapter 32 that deep inelastic 
scattering can be thought of as an off-shell photon with spacelike momentum ql" scat-
tering off a proton with momentum pI" into a hadronic final state with momentum X I" . 
The inclusive observables Q2 = _q2 and x = 2~~q can be measured from the outgoing 
electron only. The interesting kinematical region for jet physics is when the mass of the 
entire hadronic final state becomes small. The jet mass is m'} = p~ = (q + p)2 = 
Q2 l;;;X + m~. Neglecting the proton mass, this is m') = Q2 l;;;X. Thus, mJ ----) 0 as 
x ----) 1 and the ,\ = 9:f = vr-=-x can be used as an expansion parameter to describe 
the jet-like limit. 
• Heavy-to-light B meson decays. Consider the decay B ----) X sr, where Xs is any 
hadronic final state with strangeness s = 1. At the parton level this is Ib; muck) ----) 
Is; muck) I r) (see Chapter 35). In this case, the energy of the outgoing photon E, pro-
vides a clean inclusive observable. In the limit that E, ----) !!!;f-, Xs must be massless, 
and hence jet-like. Thus ,\ = 1 -
~~. is an inclusive expansion parameter. 
Let us take B ----) Xsr for concreteness, where ,\ = 1 - /!'B' In this case the jet 
is defined to include all hadrons in the final state. Of course, in a typical event, this jet 
definition does not look jet-like (it can be a single kaon). However, events that have small 
values of ,\ are jet-like, in the sense that the invariant mass of the hadronic final state 
is small. In perturbative QCD, we compute the final-state distribution in terms of quarks 
and gluons, ignoring hadronization to a first approximation. What collection of final-state 
quarks and gluons can have a small invariant mass? By momentum conservation, in the 
B meson rest frame the jet points backwards to the photon ih = -iJ,. Near ,\ = 0, 
IpJ I = Ip,l = E, ~ ~B, so the jet must have large energy and small invariant mass. 
Since p'} = (2:i pn2, for any two particles in the jet with momenta pr and pj, we have 
p') > 2Pi . Pj = 2EiEj (1 - cos Bij), where Bij is the angle between Pi and PJ . So, if any 
two particles have energies Ei and E j that are a substantial fraction of E, then they must 
have cos Bij ~ 1; that is, they must point in nearly the same direction. Such particles are 
said to be collinear. Alternatively, a particle can have small energy, in which case we say 
the particle is soft. 
They key to understanding jet properties in the ,\ ----) 0 limit is that QCD simplifies in 
soft and collinear limits. As we will see, the soft radiation depends only on the directions of 
the various jets or incoming hadrons in the event and their colors; it is independent of how 
781 

782 
Jets and effective field theory 
...... ----------------------------------------
the collinear radiation is distIibuted within each jet and of the spins of the collinear palti-
cles. The collinear radiation, on the other hand, can be computed for each jet separately, 
independently of the distribution and colors of the other jets in the event. 
To be precise about soft and collinear limits, lightcone coordinates are useful (see Sec-
tion 32.5). Suppose we have a jet with 4-momentum pj, energy Q and invariant mass rn. 
By assumption, A = S « 1. If the jet were a single parton, as it is at leading order 
in perturbation theory, then (neglecting quark masses) its momentum would be simply 
pj LO = Qnl", where nl" is a lightlike 4-vector, n2 = O. We conventionally normalize 
nO' = 1 so that nl" = (1, fi). Any 4-vector can be written in lightcone coordinates as 
1 
1 
pI" == 2(n. p)nl" + 2(n. p) nl" + pi, 
(36.10) 
where nl" = (1, -fi), which satisfies n . n = 2 and p ~ . n = p ~ . n = o. pi is the part of pI" 
in the transverse directions. In coordinates where nl" = (1, 0, 0,1) then nl" == (1, 0, 0 - 1) 
and pi =(O,PX,py,O). 
The invariant mass of a 4-vector in lightcone coordinates is 
p2 = (n . p) (n . p) + pl. 
(36.11) 
Up to terms subleading in ).., the large component of the jet is its energy ~n . p = Q. 
Thus, we must have n· p '" A2Q so that m 2 = (n· p)(n· p) + Pl = Q2)..2 has the right 
scaling. The transverse components can scale at most as AQ. Thus, the jet momentum can 
be written as 
(36.12) 
where'" indicates A scaling. This is called collinear scaling. 
A jet is not a single particle. In perturbation theory, we calculate the cross section for 
jet production by computing the cross section for producing a bunch of particles with 
momenta pr and writing pj = r.i pr. In order for p~ '" Q2 A2, all the pr in the jet 
must have collinear or softer scaling in all their components. Thus, the particle could have 
pr = Q()..2, 1, A) like the jet itself, or 
pr",{n·p, n·p,p~}"'Q{A2,A2,A2}, 
(36.13) 
which is known as ultrasoft scaling. We cannot have pr '" Q{l, 1, I} (hard scaling) or 
pr = Q( A, A, A) (soft scaling)? Since soft and ultrasoft modes will not both be relevant 
for a single calculation, we will use the terms soft and ultras oft interchangeably. 
36.3 Soft interactions 
In this section we discuss how cross sections for producing gluons simplify when that 
radiation has (ultra)soft scaling. The physical argument for simplifications in the soft limit 
2 Another possibility is pf ~ Q(>.2, >., >.) (Glauber scaling); however, then p1 = >.3 - >.2, which cannot 
vanish. Thus, these Glauber modes are purely virtual. Glauber modes play an important role in the rigorouS 
proof of factorization for Drell-Yan production but can be safely ignored in the applications we consider here. 

36.3 Soft interactions 
is similar to the argument that justifies the use of Gauss's law in classical electrodynamics. 
At large distance from a collection of charges, the electromagnetic field is determined 
almost completely by the net charge. One can include corrections through a multipole 
expansion (the dipole moment of the charge distribution gives the first subleading effect), 
but the leading effect at large distances is determined by Gauss's law. The soft limit of 
QCD is equivalent to a large-distance limit, where only the net color charge of the various 
jets is relevant, not the detailed distribution of colored particles within the jets. Leading 
power in A in the soft limit corresponds to the leading order in the multipole expansion for 
a charge distribution. 
We saw the usefulness of the soft limit back in Section 9.5, where we used it to connect 
charge conservation to Lorentz invariance of massless spin-l particles. In this section, we 
generalize aspects of that discussion and introduce an efficient way to describe soft radia-
tion patterns using Wilson lines. We begin with the discussion in an Abelian theory, where 
we show spin independence and the connection to Wilson lines, and then we discuss how 
things change in QCD. In this section, we work at tree-level and drop all if: factors. We 
also assume photon polarizations are real, so that we can write Ei instead of Et. 
36.3.1 Soft photon emission 
Suppose we have some process involving n external states with momenta P; (which can 
be incoming or outgoing) and charges Qi. In this discussion, Qi will refer to the charge 
of the particle state (pi I not the field 1/Ji (x), so electrons have Q = -1 and positrons have 
Q = + 1. We are interested in the case where these P; are all hard and well separated, so 
that they establish the jet directions. We will then consider how the matrix element in the 
state of just the particles with momenta P; is related to a matrix element in a state with 
additional soft photons. Let us write the matrix element M(Pi) for the process with just 
the P; as 
(36.14) 
In this and the next section, we will abbreviate 1/Jj == 1/Jj (0), since all fields in matrix 
elements like this will be evaluated at the same point, which we can take to be x = 0. 3 We 
would like to know how the matrix element changes when m photons with momenta kf 
are added to the final state in the limit that all the kf are soft, meaning kIL « P; for all i. 
That is, we would like to know how (Pl" . ; kl ... kml-$l .. ·1/Jnl··· Pnl relates to M(pi). 
Let us first recall the result in scalar QED derived in Section 9.5. There we showed that 
for the emission of a soft photon with momentum kIL and polarization ElL from an outgoing 
3 For a physical process, such as e+ e-
---> J1.+ J1. -, the matrix element should of course be calculated with 
the fields at different points, with those points integrated over as in the LSZ formula. However, since we are 
interested in the case where these Pi are all hard and well separated, we can expand the product of fields at 
different points in terms of local operators (through the operator product expansion). In momentum space, the 
difference between a matrix element for e+ e- ---> J1.+ J1. - and a matrix element of '/)'l/J{!'l/J is some calculable 
function C(pi). This c(p;) is a Wilson coefficient for matching onto the local operators that we focus on here. 
Since C(Pi) is independent of additional soft and collinear radiation, we set it to I for simplicity.

Emission from incoming positrons gives the same e;; ~~ factor, while outgoing positrons

The calculation in spinor QED is similar. Pulling off the spinor for an outgoing electron 
we write M = U(Pi) M(Pi) and then find 
' 
Using u(p)lp = u(p)( -m¢ + 2E· p) we then have 
(36.17) 
So the same e~ factor appears in the scalar and the spinor case. 
We can understand why the scalar and spinor give the same factor in a different way. 
The spinor propagator can be written as 
(36.18)

where we have taken the soft limit on the second line. We can then use the identity (see 
Problem 11.2) 
(36.20) 
to see that Eq. (36.17) again results. 
That the soft photon interaction is independent of Ihe , pin follow from general argu-
ments about Lorentz invariance. The denominator Pi . q follows from there beiog a pole 
associated with the emitting particle. By dimen ional analy i and Ih fa t [bat lhe only 
4-vectors available are Ef.L and pf, the form ~

then there is no way the Ward identity could be ali. fled: (he modified amplitude i. not 
even proportional to the original one. In fact, it is obvious physically that soft photons can-
not go around flipping helicities of particles, otherwise helicity would not be a very useful 
concept. More simply, we know charge must be conserved even when charged particles 

36.3 Soft interactions 
of different spin are scattered. For this to follow from the Ward identity, the form of the 
interaction in the soft limit must always be e ;:; Ohh" where h is the helicity of the particle 
before the emission and hi its helicity afterwards. For a rigorous proof, see [Weinberg, 
1964]. 
An important point is that the eikonal factors Qie:: :~ are independent of the energy of 
the charged-particle emitting photons. Writing pI" = Evl" with vI" the 4-velocity normal-
ized to VO = 1, the eikonal factor becomes Qie~. For massless particles, we usually 
write pr = Enr with n2 = 0 and nO = 1; then the eikonal factor is Qie~;:~. So the 
amplitude for emitting a soft photon depends on the directions that the charged particles 
are going and their charges, but not their energy. 
Now suppose we have two soft photon emissions in QED. If these both come from the 
same outgoing electron, then an amplitude is modified as

(36.21) 
where the second step is just algebra. Actually, this simple algebraic step even has a name; 
it is called the eikonal identity. The result is that the amplitude for two soft photons is 
given by the square of the one-photon emission amplitude. 
If there are multiple charged particles involved, then there are also diagrams where 
different particles emit the two photons. For these diagrams, the eikonal factors simply 
multiply. The result is that the sum of all the two-photon emission diagrams gives 
(36.22) 
where'l]j = -1 for an outgoing particle and 'l]j = 1 for an incoming particle. One corollary 
is that if we have two massless particles going in the same direction with momenta pi = 
El nJ.L and p~ = E2nJ.L the sum of the emissions from those particles is (Ql + Q2) ~.'~. In 
other words, the rate for emitting soft photons depends only on the total charge for particles 
in each direction. This is the reason that soft emissions factorize from collinear emissions: 
soft radiation is only sensitive to the net charge going in each collinear direction. 
The generalization to multiple emissions is straightforward. The amplitude for m pho-
ton emissions from the same particle simplifies using the eikonal identity to the product 
of m one-photon emission amplitudes. For different particles, the eikonal factors simply 
multiply. Writing p'j = Ejn'j, in the notation of Eq. (36.14) the result is that 
785 

786 
Jets and effective field theory 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
(36.23) 
This equation says that in the soft limit any of the m photons can come from any of the n 
charged particles. For each emission, the amplitude is corrected by an eikonal factor inde-
pendent of any other emission. As we will now see, this same amplitude can be reproduced 
by Wilson lines. 
36.3.2 Soft Wilson lines 
Recall from Section 25.2 that a Wilson line in QED is the exponential of a line integral 
over the gauge field. In this case, we want to integrate over the path of the charged particle. 
Writing nl-' = 1;;pl-' as the direction of a particle with momentum pI-', the relevant Wilson 
line is 
Y~ (x) = exp (ieQnnl-' 1
00 
ds AI-'(xV + snV) e-
ES
) 
(36.24) 
which goes from the point x out to 00 along the nl-' direction. We have inserted a conver-
gence factor e- ES to the expression in Eq. (25.47) to ensure that the photon field decouples 
at t = 00. Such decoupling is required for S-matrix calculations that involve asymptotic 
states (the e- ES factor is similar to the one derived in Section 14.4). We write this Wilson 
line as yt instead of Y since the particle is in the final state. For a final-state antiparticle, 
we would use Y. Qn can be either the charge of a single particle or the net charge of all 
particles in the nl-' direction. Indeed, a product of Wilson lines in the same direction is 
equivalent to a single Wilson line with the sum of the charges. 
Now consider the matrix element of this Wilson line in states with photons of momenta 
ki: (k1 . . . kmlYJ ID). If there is one photon, we need only expand Y,I to order e. A photon 
field at position y will annihilate a photon with momentum k and polarization €( k) in the 
external state: 
We then have 
(kIY~(O)ID) = ieQnnl-'(kl 1

(36.25) 
(36.26) 
This matches the leading-order eikonal interaction for an outgoing pmticle of charge Qn-
For incoming charged palticles, the appropriate Wilson line is 
Y(x) = exp (ieQnnl-' [°00 ds AI-'(xV + snV) e

36.3 Soft interactions 
which leads to 
(kIY(O)IO) = eQn 
n . E .

n· k -
ZE 
(36.28) 
which also agrees with the soft limit (you can check that the iE comes with the correct 
sign). We will drop these iE factors unless they are relevant from now on. 
Higher-order terms in the expansion of the Wilson line can be contracted with other 
external states. The ,h from the expansion of the Wilson line is exactly what is needed to 
avoid any extra symmetry factor in the Feynman rules (see Chapter 7). Thus, 
(kl ··· kmlyIt(O)ID) = 11 [-eQn~ : ~:] . 
(36.29) 
Now consider the matrix element (kl ... km I y lt (0) ... }Tn (0) I D) with multiple Wilson 
lines in directions nj with corresponding charges Qj. Each photon can be contracted with 
the field from any line. The combinatorics works out perfectly (as you can check) so that

where 'f/j is -1 for ljt factors (which correspond to outgoing charged particles) and 'f/j = 
+ 1 for lj factors (which correspond to incoming charged particles). 
The identity in Eq. (36.30) holds independently of any interactions in the Lagrangian. 
Indeed, it would hold even with a free U (1) gauge theory with no matter. When we include 
matter, comparing to Eq. (36.23), we find the tree-level relation

where all the fields are to be evaluated at x = O. Here, LQED means the matrix element 
is to be calculated using the interactions in the QED Lagrangian, while L free implies that 
the interactions in the Lagrangian are to be set to zero. We have to use the free Lagrangian 
on the right-hand side to avoid double-counting. In fact, having moved all the photons into 
the operator rather than the Lagrangian, we now have a simple factorized form for the 
amplitude: 
(36.32) 
In this form, we no longer need to write Lfree since the states (Pl' .. I and I ... Pn) have no 
photons and the state Ikl ... km ) has no charged particles. 
That the interactions of soft gluons with energetic charged particles can be described 
completely through Wilson lines; which are pure phase, is reminiscent of the description 
of interference patterns in geometric optics through the evolution of phase factors called 
eikonals. This is the reason that the e ~~~ factors are called eikonal factors and the soft 
limit is sometimes called the eikonallimit. (Wilson lines are also sometimes called eikonal 
factors as well.)

...... ------------------------------------------
Keep in mind that there is no restriction on the photon field A" appearing in the 
fl 
Wilson line; it is the same as a photon field in full QED. The only place [he sofL approxi_ 
mation is used in the whole derivation above is in saying that the momenta p~' entering [he 
amplitude M (Pi) are the same before and after the soft photon emission. This is equivalent 
to the Wilson line Y(x) and the field 1jJ(x) being evaluated at the same space-time point. 
In other words, the soft emissions leave the collinear momentum precisely unchanged, to 
leading power. The position-space language is very natural for soft emissions: a particle 
just moves along its classical trajectory, casually emitting soft photons. In fact, we already 
showed in Section 33.6.1 that Wilson lines naturally describe the semi-classical limit of a 
propagating charged particle. 
36.3.3 Soft gluon emission 
The above arguments for QED generalize in a straightforward way to QeD. We start with 
the matrix element for the process just involving quarks: 
(36.33) 
You can think of the subscript on the quark fields as a flavor index. We include to make it 
clear which field corresponds to which state. 
To see what happens when a soft gluon is emitted from a quark, we write M 
~ 
ui(p) M i. Abusing notation slightly, i now denotes the quark color index and we leave 
the momentum label implicit. The kinematical fa tors are the ame for emi.tting a gluon as 
for emitting a photon, so all that changes is a group factor Tid gets added:

k =-9SuiTti p .k Mj(p). 
(36.34) 
The eikonal factor is now -gT/j}X;. As in QED, this factor is independent of the spin of 
the colored particle. 
Now consider a final state with two soft gluons, one with momentum k1, polarization 
E1 and color a, and the other with k2 , E2 and b. If these gluons both come from the same 
quark, there are three graphs: 
c

(36.36) 
In the Abelian case, the two-photon emission amplitUde simplified with the eikonal identity 
to a form that was manifestly equal to what came out of the expansion of a Wilson line. 

36.3 Soft interactions 
In the non-Abelian case, the eikonal identity does not produce an obvious simplification, 
since [Ta , Tb] -10. Nevertheless, this amplitude is reproduced from a Wilson line. 
Recall from Section 25.2 that the Wilson line in a non-Abelian theory is path ordered: 
Y,J(x) = p{ eXP[i9sTijnl-' 1
00 
dsA~(X'/ + sn")e- cs]}. 
(36.37) 
Path ordering refers to ordering of the T a matrices such that the ones associated with the 
gluons closer to s = 0 are moved to the right. For an incoming particle, the Wilson line is 
Y n(x) = p{ exp [i9sTijnl-' [0
00 
ds A~(x" + sn")ecs] } . 
(36.38) 
As in the QED case, emissions from outgoing and incoming anti quarks will be reproduced 
using Yn and Y ~ respectively. 
We can expand to order g; to get 
(k1ak2bIY,J(O)10) =(igs)2TCTd 1
00 
ds 1
8 
dt(klak2bln.AC(tnl-')n· Ad(sn")1 0). 
(36.39) 
We can contract either gluon field with either gluon canceling the factor of 2 in front. These 
integrals are easy to evaluate, as in Eq. (36.26), with the result 
(klak2b IY~ (0)10) = (-98)2 [TaTb p' El

+ TbTa

p . (k1 + k2 ) P . k2 
(36.40) 
in agreement with Eq. (36.36) coming from graphs A and B in Eq. (36.35). In the Abelian 
case, Ta = 11. and the two factors can be combined with the eikonal identity to reproduce 
the QED result. 
The result is that factorization works in QeD just as in QED:

(36.41) 
Note that the Yi just account for emissions from the hard colored pa11icles. Other graphs, 
such as graph C in Eq. (36.35), which come from a vertex in the Lagrangian among gluons, 
are not accounted for in either Eq. (36.36) or Eq. (36.40). Indeed, the three-gluon vertex 
does not simplify in the soft limit, since when soft gluons interact among themselves, there 
is no separation of scales to produce a simplification. Thus, once the gluons leave the 
hard colored particles, they propagate and interact as in full QeD. Therefore, the gluon 
Lagrangian on the right- and left-hand sides of Eq. (36.41) should be the same as the full 
QeD Lagrangian: L = _~(F:J2. 
The matrices in the Wilson lines can be in any representation. There is a different Yn for 
antiquarks, or gluons. For example, for quarks Yn = (Yn)ij where i and j are fundamental 
color indices. The gluon Wilson line is often denoted Yn and the antiquark Wilson line by 
YJ. An often helpful relation is that YTa yt = YabTb or more explicitly

36.4 Collinear interactions 
In this section we will show why QCD cross sections factorize into matrix elements of 
jet fields in the limit that all radiation is in some number of collinear directions. To be 
concrete, consider dijet projection in e+ e- collisions. At leading order in perturbation 
theory, the final state consists of two quarks. Let us write the amplitude for this process 
when the quarks have momenta PI and P2 as (PIP2i'(b, i"1j!in). Now add to the final state 
gluons with momenta qal . .. qbl collinear to PI and momenta qa2 ... qb2 collinear to P2. 
Then, the matlix element factorizes as 
(PIP2; qal . .. qb2 1'(b,i"1j!ln) = '~f3 (PI; qal ... qbllX~ l In) (pz; qa2 ... qb2IX~3 In ) , 
(36.43) 
where ex and (3 are spinor indices. In this expression, the fields Xn are quark jet fields, 
defined as 
Xn(X) := WL (x )1j!(x), 
(36.44) 
where ni" is the direction of the jet and where Wtn is a path-ordered QCD Wilson line 
pointing in some lightlike direction t~ : 
W/Jx) = p{ eXp(igsTat~ 1
00 
ds A~(xl/ + st~)e-£s) . 
(36.45) 
It is common to take t~ = flP, but in fact the only restriction on t~ is that it is not 
collinear to the jet direction ni". For incoming collinear particles one should use W t n ' 
defined analogously to Yn in Eq. (36.38). 
As in Section 36.3, we will demonstrate the equivalence of Eq. (36.43) for scalar QED, 
where all of the essential features of the simplifications can be seen. Adding color and 
spin is then straightforward. For collinear emissions, gauge invariance plays a much more 
important role than for soft emissions. In order to understand the gauge dependence effi-
ciently, we will employ the spinor-helicity formalism from Chapter 27. The reader who 
needs motivation to learn about helicity spinors is encouraged to check Eq. (36.43) using 
polarization vectors. 
36.4.1 Collinear photon emission 
Let us begin, as in the soft emission case, with the matrix element for producing some set 
of charged particles with momenta pr in scalar QED: 
(36.46) 

36.4 Collinear interactions 
As in the previous section, all fields are implicitly evaluated at x = o. The fields ¢i create 
the states with momentum Pi and charges Qi. As in the soft case, the Qi for particles and 
antiparticles have opposite sign. If the particle is an antiparticle, we use ¢i instead of ¢:. 
Any combination of ¢ and ¢* fields is possible as long as the operator is gauge invariant. 
We simply write ¢1 ... ¢n to avoid cumbersome indices. We also take all the particles to 
be outgoing, for simplicity. Now we would like to see how M changes for a final state with 
additional photons, when each of those photons becomes collinear to one of the Pi. 
First, consider one photon with momentum q that is nearly collinear to one of the Pi that 
which we denote simply as Pl. Let us write nl" = 1;P'{ as the normalized lightlike 4-vector 
in the PI direction. In lightcone coordinates, both q and PI scale as 
(36.47) 
Thus, q . PI rv ,\2 and q . Pi rv 1 for i =I- 1. We want to extract the most dominant term in 
,\ -1 in (Pl··· Pn; ql¢l·· . ¢nIO). 
The photon with momentum q can be emitted from any of the Pi. Working only at tree-
level, but without making any other approximations yet, the scalar QED Feynman rules 
imply that 
""' 
Pi . E 
M(Pi,q) = ~ 
-eQi-M(pi + q). 
i 
Pi· q 
(36.48) 
The notation M(Pi + q) means the M(Pi) matrix element with Pi changed to Pi + q 
holding the other momentum fixed. If the Pi . E terms in the numerator scale uniformly with 
,\ then, since PI . q rv ,\2 , and Pi . q rv 1 for i =I- 1, the term with i = 1 will dominate 
this sum. That is, only the diagram where the photon is emitted from the leg to which it is 
collinear needs to be included at leading power. The i = 1 term does in fact dominate in 
a generic (non-collinear) gauge, as we will shortly see. However, one can choose a gauge 
where PI . E = 0 exactly (this is an axial gauge with p'{8I"A(x) = 0), in which case the 
i = 1 term vanishes. Thus, to extract the behavior of M(Pi, q) in the collinear limit we 
have to be careful with the gauge dependence. 
An advantage of helicity spinors (see Chapter 27) is that one can easily choose differ-
ent gauges for polarizations in different collinear sectors. Gauge dependence for helicity 
spinors amounts to dependence on the choice of reference vector TI" to which the polariza-
tions are orthogonal. Recall from Chapter 27 that polarizations satisfy E( q) . T = E( q) . q = 0 
and the only restriction on TI" is that it cannot be proportional to ql". 
In the one-photon case, let us take the photon to have negative helicity, so that 
[C(T)]"'a = v'2~. Then each term in the sum in Eq. (36.48) becomes 
Pi· E = v'2 
[Ti] (iq) 
= h~ 
Pi . q 
(iq) [qi][qT] 
[qi][qT]· 
(36.49) 
Since (ij) = [ji] up to a phase for real momenta and Pl· q = ~(lq) [q1] rv ,\2 we must have 
[q1] rv (q1) rv ,\. Similarly, since Pi· q rv ,\0 for i > 1 we must have [qi] rv (qi) rv ,\0. In a 
generic gauge, where 7' =I- Pi for any i, then [Ti] rv ,\0. The term with i = 1 in Eq. (36.49) 
then cale as tq!;l~rl ,...., >->-;0 rv ,\ -1. The other terms scale as [q~l[~T J rv >-~ ~ 0 rv ,\0. Thus, 
in a non-collinear gauge, the diagram where the photon is emitted from the leg to which it 
791 

792 
Jets and effective field theory 
------------------------------------------------------
is collinear does in fact dominate. In a collinear gauge where r = PI then the i = 1 terill 
~ AO 
vanishes exactly. However, each of the other terms now scales as [qi][ql] 
rv AO A rv ),-1. 
Thus, in a collinear gauge, the diagram with the photon coming from the collinear leg is 
zero and all the other diagrams get enhanced. Moreover, since the amplitude in scalar QED 
is gauge invariant, the sum of the i i=- 1 diagrams in collinear gauge must exactly reproduce 
the i = 1 diagram in the collinear limit. 
Now, consider multiple photon emissions. Say we want the amplitude for a final state 
in which all photons are collinear to some charged particle. Say momenta qa, ... qb, are 
collinear to PI, momenta qa2 ••• qb2 are collinear to P2 and so on. In a generic gauge, the 
matrix element is enhanced by a factor of * 
for each photon only for diagrams in which that 
photon connects directly to the charged particle collinear to it. Thus, in a generic gauge, 
(PI' .. Pn; qa, ... qbn I¢~ ... ¢n 10 ) So' (PI ; qa, ... qb, I ¢~ IO) ... (PI; qan ... qbni¢n 10). 
(36.50) 
Note that while the left-hand side is gauge invariant (assuming L: Qi = 0), the right-hand 
side is not. A gauge-invariant generalization of Eq. (36.50) is 
(PI ' .. Pn; qa, .. . qbnl¢~ . .. ¢nI O) 
So' (PI; qaJ ... qbll¢~WI10) ... (PI; qan ... qbnIW~¢nIO), (36.51) 
where T¥i is a Wilson line pointing in some direction tt that is not collinear to pt: 
(36.52) 
These are the same Wilson lines as in Eq. (36.24) but now pointing in the tt direction 
instead of the nf.' direction. 
As a first check on Eq. (36.51), note that in a generic gauge the Wilson line gives a factor 
of ::~ = [qiWr]' Since tf.' and rf.' are not collinear to qf.', these factors are subdominant to 
the), -1 contributions coming from Eq. (36.50). Thus, in a generic gauge the Wilson lines 
give only a power-suppressed contributions to matrix elements and so Eq. (36.51) reduces 
to Eq. (36.50). 
To velify Eq. (36.51) in scalar QED, first consider amplitudes with one photon of 
momentum qf.' going in the pi direction. Then the right -hand side of Eq. (36.51) contributes 
(36.53) 
where tf.' = ti is the direction of the Wilson line and rf.' can be collinear to pi or not. The 
[r~tJl] term in the middle expression comes from the emission from ¢1 while the [r~int] 
term comes from ~vi. The final form, which is manifestly gauge invariant, can be derived 
with the Schouten identity, Eq. (27.27) (or more simply by substituting [r = fHt [1 + \~;l [t, 
which is possible since spinors are two-dimensional). 
The amplitude for one emission in full scalar QED gets contributions from all lines: 
(36.54) 

36.4 Collinear interactions 
We can separate out the r -dependence and the i-dependence using 
[ri] _ ~ [it] 
[r q][qi] -
[r q][qt] + [iq][tqr 
(36.55) 
Since I: Qi = 0 the [T'~[~tJ terms do not contribute. We then have 
(36.56) 
The terms in this remaining sum are all of order A 0 unless i = 1. We thus find 
(PI' .. Pn; ql¢t ... ¢nID) ~ v'2eQI [l~~~!q] , 
(36.57) 
in agreement with Eq. (36.53). Thus Eq. (36.51) holds for one emission. For multiple 
emissions, the proof is almost as simple and we leave it to Problem 36.2. 
Collinear factorization in QED is almost identical to scalar QED, although the checks 
are messier. The equivalent of Eq. (36.51) in QED is 
(Pl '" Pn; qal . . . qbnl ~1 ... 'ljJnID) 
~ (PI; qal ... qb l l ~l WI lD) .. . (PI ; qan ... qbnIWn'ljJ~ ID ) . 
(36.58) 
Both sides of this equation are gauge invariant, so it is enough to check this factorization 
in a generic gauge. Consider again a one-photon emission in the pi direction. If this comes 
off the particle in the 1 direction, it gives 
_ eQI U(Pl) ~Til + ¢ M 
= - eQI U(Pl) (Pl' E + ~)M . 
2Pl . q 
PI . q 
2PI . q 
(36.59) 
In a generic gauge, Pi' E =I 0 and so this is enhanced by A-I, as in the scalar case (indepen-
dently of the -2 ~ ~ term, which could only make it more enhanced). This is the dominant 
Pl 'q 
contribution and has identical form coming from both sides of Eq. (36.58). On the left-hand 
side of Eq. (36.58), an emission can also come from particles in the i direction. These give 
1/i + ¢ 
- eQiu(pi) f-
-M. 
2Pi .q 
(36.60) 
In a generic gauge, there is no reason anything in this expression should be enhanced as ql" 
becomes collinear to pi. Thus, these i =I 1 emissions scale as A 0 in a generic gauge and 
can be ignored compared to the A- I enhanced emissions in Eq. (36.59). On the right-hand 
side, emissions from the Wilson lines give the same thing as in the scalar QED case, which 
also scale as A o. Thus, the two sides of Eq. (36.58) agree at leading power in a generic 
gauge. Since they are both gauge invariant, they therefore agree in any gauge. 
Collinear factorization in QCD is almost identical to QED. For example, the factoriza-
tion formula for a process involving a quark jet and an antiquarkjet is given in Eq. (36.43). 
We can perform the same check on Eq. (36.43) as we did in QED on Eq. (36.58). In a 
generic gauge, the only diagrams that contribute at leading power in QCD are those in 
which gluons are emitted from colored particles to which they are collinear. These dia-
grams are identical when coming from the factorized expression. In the factorized form, 
793 

794 
Jets and effective field theory 
...... ---------------------------------------------
the Wilson lines only give power-suppressed contributions in generic gauges. Thus, the 
two ides agree at leading power. Wben mUltiple gluon are emitted, one must also Con-
ide .. contributions in which a collinear gluon plits due to the A 3 or A4 vertex in the 
QeD Lagrangian. Although not obviou. lhe e again ag .. ee in a geneIic gauge. You are 
encouraged to check the equivalence in Problem 36.2. 
36.4.2 Splitting functions 
One consequence of collinear factorization is the universality of the Altarelli-Parisi 
splitting functions. Since the amplitude for emitting a collinear gluon from a quark is 
proportional to (SlI1/JWlp; q) , we can calculate the splitting function by squaring this 
amplitude. The amplitude is 
(36.61) 
where the first term in brackets comes from 1/J and the other from W. Choosing the spinor 
to be left-handed, so Ui (p) = (p, we find for a negative-helicity gluon, 
M_ = - V2gsTa ((qM) + [prj (pM) + [rt][pq] (PM)) 
[pqJ 
[qrJ 
[qr][qtJ 
(36.62) 
and for a positive-helicity gluon, 
M+ = _ V2gsTa ((pr) + (tr)(qp)) (pM). 
(qp) 
(qr) 
(rq) (qt) 
(36.63) 
These amplitudes are both gauge invariant. So let us choose 1'1-' = tl-', in which case the 
final terms in both amplitudes vanish. 
Now let us wIite pI-' = pI" + ql". Since pI" and ql" are nearly collinear, pI" = zpl" and 
ql" = (1 - z) pI" at leading power, so [p = fi[P and [q = vr-=z [P up to a phase that 
will drop out of the cross section. We then find 
(36.64) 
and 
(36.65) 
both of which are independent of the Wilson line direction tl-'. Squaring the amplitudes and 
summing over polarizations and colors gives 
'""

1 1 + Z 2 [ 
~ IM+I = gsCF p2 1- z MPj(PM) ,

(36.66) 
which we recognize as the DGLAP splitting function. Since we have already proven that 
collinear emissions for any process are given by matrix elements (p, q!1/JWISl), we have 
hereby proven the universality of the DGLAP splitting functions. You can calculate the 
gluon splitting function in a similar manner in Problem 36.3. 

36.5 Soft-Collinear Effective Theory 
36.5 Soft-Collinear Effective Theory 
In the previous sections, we have seen how matrix elements in QCD factorize for pro-
cesses involving soft or collinear radiation at tree-level. We also saw how soft radiation 
is only sensitive to the total (color) charge going in each direction, a result familiar from 
the multipole expansion in classical electromagnetism. It should therefore not surprise you 
that processes with soft and collinear radiation factorize (see also Problem 36.4). That is, 
at leading power, 
(Xl;'" ; Xm; Xsl7/JI ... 7/JmIO) 
~ (XI I7/JI WIIO)··· (XmIW);,7/JmIO) (XsXIYI ... Y~IO), (36.67) 
where Xj contains gluons going in the direction collinear to the jth jet and Xs contains 
the soft gluons. As before, all fields are evaluated at x = 0 and the subscripts on 7/J denote 
the quark flavor. We showed that this factorized expression holds, at tree-level, if all the 
final-state particles have momenta that fall into one of these sectors. 
The fact that the only relevant interactions at leading power are among particles going 
in the same direction or among soft gluons is a kind of superselection rule which can be 
imposed at the level of the Lagrangian. With this insight, we can write Eq. (36.67) as 
(Xl;'" ; Xm; Xsl 7/JI ... 7/JmIO)LQCD 
~ C(Q)(XI;··· ; Xm; Xsl7/JI WlyI ... Ym W);,7/JmIO)LsCETl 
(36.68) 
where LSCET is a Lagrangian in which all the sectors have been decoupled and C( Q) = 1 
(at tree-level). More explicitly, let us assign a new quantum number j = 1 ... m or "soft" 
to the states in Xj and Xs respectively. We also introduce fields 'ljJj and Aj for each sector 
that can create and annihilate only particles with those quantum numbers. Then 
(36.69) 
where Lj contains quarks and gluons in the jth collinear sector and Lsoft contains the soft 
quarks and gluons. Each of these Li and Lsoft are identical to LQCD. The Lagrangian LSCET 
is the Lagrangian for Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).4 
We have only demonstrated Eq. (36.68) at tree-level where C( Q) = 1. Loop contribu-
tions to the matrix elements on both sides of this equation will generically be both UV and 
IR divergent. However, since the soft and collinear tree-level matrix elements on both sides 
agree, the IR divergences in the loops should agree as well. After all, the IR divergences 
in loops must be able to cancel the IR divergences in phase space integrals over tree-level 
graphs (see Section 20.3).5 The UV divergences may be different, but they can be removed 
with counterterms that also can be different on the two sides. Thus, the difference between 
4 There are actually a number of different formulations of SCET, all of which are equivalent at leading power, 
and equivalent to the formulation we have described. A discussion of power corrections is beyond our scope. 
S Technically, the IR divergences only agree if the overlapping region between soft and collinear momenta is not 
double-counted in SCET. Conveniently, for the application discussed in this chapter, this zero bin gives zero in 
dimensional regularization, so we will ignore it.

Jets and effective field theory

the two sides ofEq. (36.68) should not depend on the IR scales or the UV cutoff. We there-
fore expect to be able to absorb the differences into the short-distance Wilson coefficient 
C(Q), which may depend on hard scales Q but not on soft or collinear scales. We will not 
prove this assertion, but we will verify it in explicit examples below. 
One of the important applications of SCET is to simplify derivations of factorization 
formulas. In the traditional approach to factorization, derivations are done using Feynman 
diagrams. Derivations in SCET are done at the level of fields. Working with fields has 
the great advantage of making universality manifest: the same objects appear in different 
factorization theorems. The simplest processes for which factorization can be analyzed 
are e+ e-
-+ hadrons (which is e+ e-
-+ qq at tree-level) or its crossings: deep inelastic 
scattering (e- P -+ e- X) and Drell-Yan (P P -+ e+ e-). Deep inelastic scattering was 
studied using full QCD in Chapter 32. Here we discuss Drell-Yan and e+ e- -+ hadrons. 
36.5.1 The Orell-Van process 
The Drell-Yan process refers to the creation of a pair of leptons in the collision of two 
hadrons, such as in P P -+ f.1.+ f.1.- + X [Drell and Yan, 1970). Let us denote the incoming 
hadron momenta as Pi and P,f, the outgoing lepton momenta as ki and k~, and the 
hadronic final-state momentum as p~. Let us also wlite qjJ, = ki + k~ as the momentum 
of the off-shell photon decaying to leptons (we ignore the weak interactions for simplicity). 
Thus Pi + P,f = ql1- + p~ and q2 > O. 
A rigorous factorization theorem exists for inclusive Drell-Yan, meaning only the final 
state leptons are measured [Collins et al., 1988]. This theorem states that the cross section is 
given by a convolution among parton distribution functions and a perturbative h<U'd process, 
up to corrections suppressed by factors of A'J:iD where !vI is the invariant rna . of the lepton 
pair. Since everything we have shown in this chapter so far is ba. ed on tree-level matrix 
elements, we are in no position to derive a rigorous factorization theorem in SCET. On 
the other hand, while the rigorous factorization theorem justifies performing perturbative 
calculations, it does not indicate a way to perform these calculations more efficiently than 
we would if we simply assumed factorization holds. Thus, we will simply assume that 
our tree-level results hold to all orders in perturbation theory and apply the effective field 
theory technology to resum large logarithms. 
We will focus on the threshold region, where the invariant mass of the lepton pair 
.!'vI == R approaches the center-of-mass energy Vs = V(P1 + P2 )2 of the hadronic 
collision. The key property of this kinematic region is that the scattering is almost elastic. 
In the center-of-mass frame, the energy Ex of the hadronic final state must be small. That 
is, the hadronic final state is soft. Therefore, the process near threshold involves incoming 
protons (which can be described with collinear fields) and outgoing soft radiation. To be 
clear, there are two small scales in this problem: A = 1 -
~2 « 1 and A~~D « 1. We 
are not interested in resumming logs of At~D (beyond what is encoded in as). We will 
treat scales of order AQCD (such as the proton mass) as being exactly zero and focus on 
logarithms of A. 

36.5 Soft-Collinear Effective Theory 
The setup for the factorization begins by pulling out the leptonic tensor L,"v, as in 
Chapters 20 and 32. The Drell-Yan cross section can be written as 
2e
4 
W'"v L 
drrl ,2 
dO" = ly[4s 
,"v 
LIPS' 
(36.70) 
where the leptonic tensor L'"v = Tr[ljlll''"ljf2l'V] is the same as for DIS, Eq. (32.11) (up 
to a factor of 2 from the spin averaging), and drrt'r~s refers to the leptonic phase space 
(the hadronic phase space is included in W'"V). Ignoring the weak interactions, and using 
just one quark flavor for simplicity, the lepton pair is produced through a neutral current 
J'" = ?[;,'"'IjJ. The hadronic tensor can be expressed in terms of this current (see Chapters 20 
and 32) as 
x 
(36.71) 
where Qq is the quark charge. The second line is derived by inserting factors of eiPx with 
iw the translation operator, just as in Eq. (32.77). We can sum over lepton spins (cf. Eq. 
(20.29)) remaining differential in the q'" to get 
(36.72) 
with qo = j ij'2 + lvI2. So far, everything is exact and applies in any kinematical regime. 
Now let us exploit the observation that as ~M ---+ vis the only relevant partonic states have 
either collinear scaling (with respect to the incoming hadrons) or soft scaling if they are in 
the hadronic final state. Let n'" = i
1 Pi. In the center-of-mass frame, TIP = i2 PI) points 
backwards to n'". The effective field theory operator we need to match onto at leading order 
is therefore 
(36.73) 
where Y nand Y n are as in Eq. (36.38) and WI and W2 are as in Eq. (36.45), pointing in 
directions ti and ti, with the integrals going from -00 to 0 (as the protons are incoming). 
The only restriction on ti is that it is not collinear to n'", thus we can take ti = TIP. 
Similarly, we can take ti = n'". The second form in Eq. (36.73) makes the color and spin 
indices explicit. 
Writing Xn = W ~ 'IjJ to simplify the notation, we then have 
(PIP2 lot'"(x)O'"(O) IPIP2! = -(DI [Y~Y n(X)L [Y~Y n(O)] klID) 
x '~a(PIIXfk(O)xfj(x)IPI) X '~i3(P2Ix~i(X)x~I(O)IP2)' (36.74) 
where i, j, k, I are color indices and 0:, (3, p, 0" are spinor indices. The factor of -1 comes 
from anticommuting the spinors to get them into this form.

Since the proton is a color-neutral object, the collinear matrix elements must be diagonal 
in color space. Thus, we can average over colors to write 
(36.75) 
The matrix element on the right has the usual implicit color sum. These bil factors induce 
a color trace on the soft Wilson lines. The color-averaged soft matrix element is called a 
soft function. The Drell-Yan soft function is defined by 
1 
-t-
-t-
WDy(x) == N tr (DIY "Y n(x)Y nY ,,(O)ID), 
(36.76) 
with tr denoting a color trace. 
The collinear matrix elements are closely related to parton distribution functions. To 
make the connection precise, we first multipole expand the collinear field: 
(P2Ix2(X) = (P21 [1 + ~(n
. x)(n· 0) + ~(n. x)(n· 0) + X-.l . O-.l + ... ] X2(0). 
(36.77) 
The detivatives can then act as momentum operators on the proton state, pulling out factors 
of the proton momentum. Now, the proton momentum is P!) = E2ni-' + O(AQCD ). Thus, 
at leading power in A~ D , the n . 0 and 0 -.l terms in this expansion can be dropped. Then 
the series is resummed into 
(36.78) 
where x~ == ~(n' x) nil. Moreover, we must have 
(36.79) 
where dx_ = )zd(n. x) and q~ = ~(n' q)ni-'. This proportionality follows from Lorentz 
invariance, since the matrix element can only be proportional to the two 4-vectors around: 
P!) and q~, which are both proportional to nil. To find the proportionality constant, we can 
contract both sides with 7ftP17 • This gives 
J 
dx_e- iHX- (P2Ix~(x- )x2(0)IP2) = yt:P J 
dx_e-iHX- (P2Ix2(X-)~X2(O)IP2)' 
(36.80) 
Finally, taking the inverse Fourier transform we can connect to the PDFs: 
(36.81) 
where fq coincides with the lightcone definition of the PDFs from Eq. (32.117): 
(36.82) 
Now we can put everything together. The 'Y-matrices combine into a Dirac trace: 
Trbll~'YIl7ftl = -16. We also use n . PI = n . P2 = yS to find 

36.5 Soft-Collinear Effective Theory 
Here, C is the Wilson coefficient from matching between JI" in QCD to 01" in SCET. Our 
normalization is such that C = 1 at leading order. You can calculate C and WDY(x) at 
I-loop in Problem 36.6. 
36.5.2 e+ e- ---+ dijets 
Next we will discuss the factorization formula for e+ e-
---7 dijets. This is a crossing of 
Drell-Yan, so up to some kinematic factors, the starting point is the same. Let ki and k~ 
be the electron momenta, and ql" = ki + k~ the total momentum. In the center-of-mass 
frame, ql" = (Q, 0, 0, 0) with Q > O. The cross section averaged over the incoming e+e-
spins is first written in terms of the current JI" = lfryl"'I/J as (cf. Eq. (20.34)) 
(J = (Ja ;~~ ~ J 
dIIx (21f)4 04(q - px) (DIJI"(O)IX)(XIJI"(O)ID), 
x 
(36.84) 
where (Ja 
= 
N ;;~; Lq Q~ is the tree-level e+ e-
---7 
hadrons cross section. 
Again, we are ign6ring the weak interactions for simplicity. The sum over 
states includes a color and spin sum. To check the normalization, at tree-level 
(DIJI"(O)IX)(XIJI"(O)I D) = NTr[Jjnl"R2/,I"] = -4NQ2, where pi and p~ are the 
momenta of the two outgoing quarks. Also, the inclusive integral over two-body phase 
space is JdIIx (21f)4 04(q-px) = 
8~ (see Eqs. (5.29) or (20.A.85)). Thus we find 
(J = (Ja at tree-level. 
For dijet production, only certain hadronic final states IX) can contribute to this sum. To 
be concrete, we consider the cross section when thrust is close to I, so T = 1 - T « 1. Let 
nl" denote the thrust axis. As discussed in Section 36.1, in order to have T « 1, all of the 
final state particles must either be collinear to nl", collinear to nP or soft. We denote states 
in these regions of phase space as IXI ), IX2 ) and IXs ) respectively. As shown at tree-level 
in Sections 36.3 and 36.4, matrix elements with final states in this kinematical regime agree 
with those from an effective theory with collinear sectors in the nl" and nP directions and a 
soft sector. The different sectors are completely decoupled from each other. In the effective 
theory, the cross section is given by 
(J = (Ja ;~~ ~(21f)4 04(q - px) (DIC*otl"(O)IX)(XICOI"(O)ID), 
x 
(36.85) 
with the same operator as in Drell-Yan, given in Eq. (36.73) and C its Wilson coef-
ficient. In terms of the jet fields Xn = WJ 'l/Jn defined in Eq. (36.44), the operator is 
01" = :\)YJ/,I"YnX2.

Since IX) = \X1 ; X 2; Xs), the matrix elements factorize:

x N Tr{ (D\~Xl\Xl) (Xl\Xl\D)} x N Tr{ (D\X2\X2)(X2\¢X2\D)} , 
(36.86) 
where Tr is a Dirac trace. To arrive at this form, simplifications have been applied following 
the Drell-Yan example above: The collinear matrix elements are color diagonal, so we have 
averaged over color. Also, the collinear scaling of the states \X1 ) and \X2 ) allowed us to 
insert the ¢ and ~ factors. Note that we did not need to talk about the scaling of x in this 
case, since all the operators are evaluated at x = O. 
To further simplify the cross section, we use that qJ.' = P'Jc1 + P'Jc2 + p'Jcs' Since q '" AO 
is the hard scale, it fixes the only A ° components, which are the large components of the 
collinear fields: n· P Xl = n . P X2 = Q. The 1- components of the collinear momenta scale 
as AI . Thus, we must also have pt = -p:L. Therefore, overall momentum conservation 
amounts to 
(36.87) 
Since the initial states are averaged over, the cross section cannot depend on the dijet 
axis ii. Let us therefore choose ii to be at e = ¢ = O. We then compensate for omitting an 
angular integral by adding a factor of 4Jro(e)o(¢) = JrQ202(piJ, where the ~2 comes 
from \P'Xl\ = ~. Thus, with fixed ii, we substitute

with ri and r~ the 4-vectors given in Eq. (36.91). H == 101 2 in this expression is called the 
hard function. 
To progress, we specialize to the calculation of thrust. As discussed in Section 36.1, if 
7 = 1 - T « 1, then 7 rv 71 where 71 == d2 (pr + pD, with pi and p~ defined as the 
sums of the momenta of all particles going into the two hemispheres defined by the thmst 
axis. All particles in IXl ) go into hemisphere 1, all particles in IX2 ) go into hemisphere 2, 
and soft particles in IXs ) can go either way. Let us write kj(l for the sum of soft momenta 
that go into hemisphere 1. From the power-counting discus;ion in Section 36.2, with ,\ = 
d2P~, rv 7 in this case, the collinear and soft momenta scale as 
(n. kx];,n· kxl,k±l) rv Q(,\2,,\2,,\2), 
(36.93) 
so thatp~, rv ,\2 and kr rv ,\4. Also Px, . kx]; rv ~(n. px,)(n. kXI) rv ,\2. Thus, the 
hemisphere-1 mass at leading power is 
p~, = (P'l, + k'J.:;)2 rv pt + Q(n· kx ;) = ri + Q(n· kXI)' 
We have used that ri = PXi from the 6-functions in Eq. (36.90). Therefore, 
Q27 rv p~, + P~2 rv ri + r~ + Q(n. kx ;) + Q(n· kx ;) . 
(36.94) 
(36.95) 
This equation implies that the observable of interest, 7, when small, reduces to a sum of 
a contribution from each collinear sector plus a contribution from the soft sector, with no 
interference. 
To calculate the thmst distribution we insert two more integrals and two more 
6-functions into our cross section to get

(36.96) 
Now, when 71 « 1, rl nand r2n must be small. Therefore ri and r~, as defined in 
Eq. (36.91), must have collinear scaling. Thus, we can extend the sum over collinear states 
IXI ) (XII and IX2) (X21 to sums over all states. This lets us write the cross section in terms 
of a universal object called ajet function. The jet function in the n"' direction is defined as

4 x eipXTr[(OIXn(x) I X)(Xltixn(O)1 0)].

(36.97) 
Here, Tr is a Dirac trace and the sum over colors is implicit. The normalization is set so 
that J(p"') = 6(p2) at leading order, as we show below. Since the sum over IX) in the jet 
801 

802 
Jets and effective field theory 
~ 
function is complete, it can be written as the discontinuity (twice the imaginary part) of a 
forward matrix element (see Section 24.1.2): 
(36.98) 
By Lorentz invariance and invariance under rescaling of ii, the jet function can only depend 
on p2, as we have written. Physically, the jet function gives something close to the prob-
ability of finding a jet with invariant mass p2 (it is not exactly this probability since soft 
radiation also contributes to jet masses). This same jet function appears in the factOlization 
formulas for many processes (for example, B ~ X si, deep inelastic scattering and direct 
photon production). Note that the jet function is only useful when evaluated at values of 
p2 « Q2 for some hard scale Q. Otherwise, extending the sum from collinear states to all 
states induces uncontrolled subleading power contributions. 
We also define the hemisphere soft function as 
Shemi(k1n, k2n) == L ~ tr { (DIYJYnIXs)(Xs/YJYnID)} 
Xs 
X c5(k1n - n . kx; )c5(k2n - n . kx; ) (36.99) 
As with the collinear radiation, the scale at which the soft function is to be evaluated is 
determined by the factorization formula. For T1 « 1 it implies kln « 1 and k2n « 1. 
Thus, we will extend the sum to include all rather than just soft states. The soft function 
for thrust is related to the hemisphere soft function by 
(36.100)

We will next compute the hard, jet and soft functions to order a s in perturbation theory 
using SCET and check that the singular behavior of thrust is reproduced. 
36.6 Thrust in SCET 
Having set up tl1e factOlization formula for ilirust in the dijet limit, we can now compute 
the hard, jet and soft functions in perturbation theory. We will work to order as, which 
allows for leading-log resummation. All our calculations will be done in Feynman gauge. 

36.6 Thrust in SCET 
36.6.1 Hard function 
The hard function is defined as H(Q) = IC(Q)1 2. We compute C by matching JI' to 01', 
which can be done independently of the dijet observable we are interested in. The hard 
function for dijet production is the same as for Drell-Yan and related to the hard function 
for deep inelastic scattering by analytic continuation. 
An example of matching was worked out in Section 3l.3 for the 4-Ferrni theory. 
The procedure here is identical. The Wilson coefficient is computed from the difference 
between radiative corrections to the current JI' in QCD and to 01' in SCET. We did 
the hard work for this loop in Chapter 20 and applied it to QCD in Chapter 26. From 
Eq. (20.AlOl), replacing eR ---> - gs and adding the QCD color factor (see Section 26.3.1), 
we have 
(36.102) 
There are also the wavefunction renormalization graphs and counterterm graphs which do 
not have to be calculated, as we explain shortly. 
In SCET, the loops are the virtual corrections to 01' = ?jJW1Yn,l'yJW]7fJ in a 
Lagrangian with decoupled fields .eSCET = .esaft + .en + .en. The virtual diagrams at 
order as have one of the following topologies: 
Hl 
H2 
H3 
H4 
H5 
/ 
~ 
H6 
(36.103) 
In diagrams H2, H3 and H 4, gluons with an endpoint on the operator vertex correspond 
to terms coming from the expansion of the Wilson line. For example, expanding Yn and 
Yn gives factors of gs :'; .. ~ and gs ~ .. ~ respectively; these gluon fields can then be contracted 
with a propagator from .esaft generating diagram H 4. Diagrams H5 and H6 are identical 
to the wavefunction graphs in pure QCD. Thus they will cancel in the matching, which is 
why we could ignore them in M Qco. 
Since .en and .en are completely decoupled, diagram Hl does not actually exist. In 
diagram H2, the gluon must be an ii-collinear gluon, and in diagram H3, the gluon 
must be n-collinear. In diagram H 4, each Wilson line (soft or collinear) gives a factor 
of gs ~ .. ~ for some lightlike 4-vector tl'. Since t . t = 0 the loop vanishes if the same 
Wilson line produces both gluons. Since collinear sectors are decoupled, the only contri-
bution to H 4 can therefore be from soft gluons, with one vertex from Yn and the other 
from YJ. Thus we need to compute H2 and H3 for collinear gluons and H 4 for soft 
gluons. 
803 

804 
Jets and effective field theory 
Diagram H2 gives 
(36.104) 
The integrand has LO pr duce a L rentz-invariant quantity of mass dimension d - 4. The 
only Lorentz invariant ar und are p2. which i zero, and fi . p. However, the integral is also 
invariant under fil-' --+ A;;',I' for any A, thu iL cann l be (fi . p) d-4. Thus it must vanish. 
The soft graph is 
= o. 
(36.105) 
Now there is simply no quantity with any mass dimension on which the graph could 
depend. Thus it also must vanish in dimension regularization. 
The result is that all of the purely virtual graphs completely vanish in SCET in dimen-
sional regularization. This is a feature of SCET that is incredibly useful. The virtual graphs 
can also be thought of as converting -l poles into --L poles. Since the IR singularities of 
EtR 
€"uv 
QCD are identical to those in SCET, the -l poles must drop out of the matching.6 The ~ 
~R 
E~ 
poles in both SCET and QCD are removed with counterterms in the respective theories. 
Thus, in dimensional regularization with MS, we simply drop all virtual graphs and all 1 
E 
poles of any sort. Thus, the Wilson coefficient can be read off from the virtual graph in 
QCD. From Eq. (36.102) we find

The jet function is defined in Eq. (36.98). Pulling the ift, out of the integral, it can be written

d4xe
iPX (Sl IT{X/3(0)Xcy(x)}ISl)]}. 
(36.108)

(36.109) 
6 An important check on SCET is provided by using an IR regulator other than dimensional regularization. Then 
one can see explicitly that the IR divergences of SCET and QCD match up. See for example [Manohar, 2003]. 

36.6 Thrust in SCET 
where Eq. (24.25) has been used on the last step. 
At order as the jet function is easiest to compute with cut diagrams using the optical 
theorem. There are eight possible cuts. Four cut the gluon and a quark:

These last four diagrams put the massless quark on shell, so they give scaleless integrals 
and vanish in dimensional regularization. 
One fairly easy way to calculate the jet function is in lightcone gauge, n . A = O. In 
lightcone gauge, the collinear Wilson line is W = 1 and so diagrams J1, J2 and J3 
vanish. J 4 is just the self-energy graph in QeD. Thus, the jet function is just the imaginary 
part of the quark propagator in lightcone gauge. We leave this approach to the calculation 
to Problem 36.5. 
We will instead evaluate the graphs in Feynman gauge. In Feymnan gauge, diagram J1 
is proportional to n . n and hence vanishes. Diagram J2 (before the cut) gives 
(36.110) 
Following the cutting rules in Section 24.1.2, we compute the discontinuity by replacing 
p2~i£ ---> (-27ri)J(p2) for the cut lines and summing over spins. After some algebra, this 
results in 
(36.111) 
Diagram J3 gives the same answer with n f-7 n. Graph J 4 is computed similarly, giving 
(36.112) 
Summing diagrams J1 to J 4 and the leading order result gives 
805 

806 
Jets and effective field theory 
To expand this in c we can use the identity 
(36.114) 
where the *-distribution is a generalization of a +-distribution for dimensional variables. 
*-distributions satisfy 
(36.115) 
and [1 (p2)] * = 1 (p2) for p2 > O. We then find 
J(p') d(p') + GF ;; {O(P')(,; + ~ +7 -ff') -[; 1. -f -~n ~ ] J 
(36.116) 
Since the jet function is an inclusive cross section at fixed p2, it should be IR finite. Thus, 
the ~ and ~ IR divergences in Eq. (36.116) lUll t be exactly canceled by the virtual graphs. 
We have not computed the virtual graphs (diagram J5 U1fough J8), since they vanish 
exactly in dimensional regularization. If one wer to eparale the UV from IR singularities, 
these virtual graphs would have to give ± - + terms with coefficients to precisely cancel 
.fIR 
g UY 
the IR divergences in Eq. (36.116). Thus, adding the virtual graphs simply converts all .1 
E 
and ~ divergences to UV divergences. These UV divergences are then removed with MS 
counterterms, just as in the hard function calculation. The result is that

36.6.3 Soft function 
The soft function is S(kl' k2 ) = o(kd o(k2 ) at zeroth order. This is simply because no 
radiation is emitted so the total soft momentum going into each hemisphere is zero. At 
next-to-Ieading order, the soft function is an integral over real emission graphs summed 
over gluon polarizations. We write 
(36.118) 
The diagrams are meant to indicate emissions from the Yn and Yn Wilson lines (as dia-
grams H2, H3 and H 4 in Eq. (36.103)). To distinguish which Wilson line the gluons are 
coming from, we draw the diagrams as we would in full QCD. Using Wilson lines instead 
of the full QCD Feynman rules is equivalent to taking the soft limit before the diagrams 
are evaluated. 

36.6 Thrust in SCET 
There is only one sector of soft gluons, thus either emission in Eg. (36.118) can go into 
either hemisphere. In Feynman gauge the terms that come from the sguare of one diagram 
are propOltional to n . n = 0 or fi . fi = O. Thus, we only need to evaluate the cross term. 
We find 
= C as 
f-l2E:

B(k1 ) 6(k )] . 
F 7r cT(1 _ E) 
k~+2c

(36.119) 
We then expand near E = 0 using Eg. (36.l14). Including the leading-order result, the 
hemisphere soft function to order as is 
Shemi (k1 , k2 ) = 6 (k1) 
6 (k2) [1 + C F ~; ( ~2) ] 
- 8CF ~; {[Ink: 1 
* 6(k2) + [Ink: 1 
* 6(kIl } . (36.120) 
The thrust soft function is then 
ST(k) = 1

dk'Shemi(k' ,k - k') 
= 6(k)[1+CF~;(~2)] - 16CF~;[lnk~L +O(a;).

36.6.4 Singular part of thrust 
Now let us put everything together to show that SCET reproduces the singular terms in 
the thrust distribution as T ----> O. Plugging Egs. (36.l07), (36.117) and (36.121) into Eg. 
(36.l01) we get

expression. 
36.6.5 Resummed thrust 
To resum the singular pmts of the thrust distribution, we need to calculate and solve the 
renormalization group equations for the hard jet and soft functions. These ROEs are easiest 
to derive by differentiating the fixed-order expressions with respect to f-l. Taking the f-l-
derivative of the hard function in Eg. (36.107) gives 
f-ldH = as(f-l) CF (81n Q: -12) H +O(a2).

The thrust distribution resummed with SGJ::T compared to data from LEP at Q = 91.2 GeV. 
Here NNNLL+NNLO means the resummation is performed at the 
next-to-next-to-next-to-Ieading logarithmic level and the non-singular distribution is 
calculated exactly at next-to-next-to-Ieading order, 0 (Q;~), in perturbative QCD. The 
agreement with data is excellent for 1 - T > 0.1 or so. For lower values of 1 - T, 
hadronization effects become important. 
This final expression is manifestly independent of /-l. Instead, it depends on /-lh, /-lj and /-ls. 
These three scales should be chosen as the characteristic scales associated with hard, jet 
and soft degrees of freedom. More precisely, one can see from the various combinations 
appearing in this expression that /-lh = Q, /-ls = TQ, and /-lj = y' /-lsQ = ...fiQ are natural 
choices. Choosing these scales gives

Jets and effective field theory 
To compare to data, one should add to this distribution the non-singular part of the thrust 
distribution computed at fixed order in perturbative QCD. The non-singular distribution is 
currently known at 0(0:;), called NNLO. 
Plots of the thrust distribution computed in SCET, resummed, and supplemented with 
the non-singular distribution from perturbative QCD are shown in Figure 36.3. The reSUffi_ 
mation is critical to providing qualitative agreement with the data. For small values of T 
the soft scale becomes comparable to hadron masses and then hadronization can no longer 
be ignored. Since /-is = TQ this happens for T :s rr;; rv 0.1. One can see the importance 
of these hadronization corrections directly in Figure 36.3. For values of T ;::: 0.1 the quan-
titative agreement with data is excellent. While power corrections can also be treated with 
effective field theory, they are beyond our scope.

A.1 Dimensional analysis 
In relativistic quantum field theory, it is standard to set 
c = 2.998 x 108meters/second = 1, 
which turns meters into seconds and 
n = ~ 
= l.054572 x 10-34 joules· seconds = 1, 
27r 
(A.I) 
(A.2) 
which turns joules into inverse seconds. This gives all quantities dimensions of energy 
(or mass, using E = mc2 ) to some power. Quantities with positive mass dimension (e.g. 
momentum p) can be thought of as energies, and quantities with negative mass dimension 
(e.g. position x) can be thought of as lengths. 
Sometimes we write the mass dimension of a quantity with brackets, as m 
[p] = [~l = 1, meaning these quantities have mass dimension 1. Other examples are 
Thus, 
[dx] = [x] = [t] = -1, 
[01-'] = [PI-'] = 1, 
[velocity] = [~] = [x] - [t] = O. 
The action should be a dimensionless quantity: 
[S] = [J d
4x£] = o. 
So Lagrangians (really, Lagrangian densities) have dimension 4: 
[£] = 4. 
For example, a free scalar field has Lagrangian £ = HOI-'</J)(ol-'¢) so 
[¢l = 1,

and so on. In general, bosons (whose kinetic terms have two derivatives) have mass dimen-

Keeping the factors of 27r straight is important. The origin of all the 27r's is the relation 
(A.13) 
This identity holds with either sign; our sign convention for quantum fields is discussed 
below. To remove the 27r from the exponent, we can rescale either x or p. We rescale p. 
Then 
I: dp e±ipx = 27r 8 (x). 
(A.14) 
Our convention for the Fourier transform is

(A.16) 
which has spatial components p f-7 -iV, as in quantum mechanics. 
I The origin of the term barn comes from the fact that inducing nuclear fission by hitting 235 U with neutrons is 
as easy as hitting the broad side of a barn. The inelastic neutron- 235U scattering cross section is arollnd 1 barn 
= 1O-28m2 at E ~ 1 MeV. 

A.2 Signs 
A.2 Signs 
Although the meat of most calculations is independent of the signs, physical results are 
very dependent on getting the sign right. Here we tabulate some of the signs in important 
equations. 
First, we will never use curved-space backgrounds, so the metric g"v and the Minkowski 
metric 'T}"v are interchangeable. The metric we use has sign convention 
-1 
(A.17) 
-1 
This convention makes p2 = pg - j!2 = m 2 > O. The alternative, g = diag( -1,1,1,1) , 
makes p2 < O. 
The signs of kinetic terms in Lagrangians are set so that the total energy is positive 
(see Sections 8.2 and 12.5). It is easiest to remember the signs by writing the Lagrangian 
as L = Lkin - V, where V is the potential energy, which should be positive in a stable 
system. For example, for a scalar field, the mass term ~m2¢2 should give positive energy, 
so V = 
~ m 2 ¢2 and L = 
-
~ m 2 ¢2. The kinetic term sign can then be recalled from 
p2 ----; -0 = -8~ in Fourier space and p2 = m 2 on-shell, so that the equations of motion 
should be (0 + m 2 ) ¢ = O. Therefore, we have 
L = -~¢(O + m 2)¢ = ~(8,,¢)(8"¢) -
~m2¢2. 
(A.l8) 
The factor of ~ makes the kinetic term contribute (0 + m 2 ) ¢ to the equations of motion 
(instead of 2 (0 + m 2 ) ¢). For a complex scalar, the Lagrangian is 
(A.l9) 
without the ~, since now variation with respect to ¢* will give (0 + m 2 ) ¢. 
For gauge bosons, the Lagrangian is

L = -4F"v = -28"Av8"Av + 28"Av8vA" = 2AvOAv - 2A,,(8,,8v)Av, (A.20) 
where F"v = 8"Av - 8vAw In this equation and many others we employ the modern 
summation convention under which contracted indices can be raised or lowered with-
out ambiguity: x . p = x"p" = x"p" = x"Pw All of these contractions are equal to 
g"Vx"pv = g"vx"pv. The sign and normalization of the -i factor in Eq. (A.20) can be 
understood as follows. In Lorenz gauge 8e<A" = 0 the Lagrangian is just L = 
~ AvOAv = 
~ AoOAo -
~ ADA. This gives the three spatial components A, which actually contain the 
propagating transverse degrees of freedom, the same kinetic terms as for scalars. (That the 
scalar component Ao with the wrong sign is not problematic is explained in Section 8.2.)

B.1 Integration parameters 
To evaluate loop integrals in quantum field theory, it is often helpful to introduce Feynman 
or Schwinger parameters. 
8.1.1 Feynman parameters 
Feynman parameters are based on a number of easily verifiable mathematical identities. 
The simplest is

(B.2) 
1 
(1

ABC = Jo dxdydzO(x+y+z-l)[xA+yB+zCP' 
(B.3) 
These are useful because they let us complete the square in the denominator. For example, 
(B.4) 
where.0. = -p2x(1 - x). Then we can shift k -> k + xp leaving an integral that only 
depends on k 2 . 
8.1.2 Schwinger parameters 
Another useful set of integration parameters are called Schwinger parameters. They are 
based on the following mathematical identities, which hold when Im(A) > 0:

when Im(A) > 0 and Im(B) > 0 (i.e. with Feynman propagators). These Schwinger 
parameters sand t have a nice physical interpretation: sand t are the proper times of the 
particles as they travel along their paths in the Feynman graph. This Schwinger proper-time 
interpretation is discussed in Chapter 32. 
Note that writing s+t = T and x = s!t' or t = XT and s = (l - x)T, Eq.(B.7) becomes 
-

the two particles in the loop.

Schwinger parameters are used in Chapters 34 and 35. 
B.2 Wick rotations 
After introducing Feynman parameters and completing the square, one is often left with an 
integral over a loop momentum kM in Minkowski space. Once the ic factors are put in for 
Feynman propagators, I-loop integrals often appear as

Assuming ~ > 0 (you can check that Wick rotation still works for ~ < 0 in Problem B.l), 
this integral has poles at ko = ,/[;,2 + ~-ic and ko = _Vk2 + ~+ic, as shown in Figure 
B.1. Since the poles are in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants ofthe ko complex plane, 
the integral over the figure-eight contour shown vanishes. Thus, the integrals over the real 
axis and the imaginary axis are equal and opposite. Therefore, we can substitute ko --+ iko

is known as a Wick rotation. After the Wick rotation, the i f: will no longer playa role and 
we can just set f: = O. 
Once Wick-rotated, the integrals are evaluated in a straightforward way. We will need 
the formula for the surface area of the Euclidean 4-sphere: J dD4 = 271"2 . Using this, we 
find 
Then, for example, Eq. (B .11) with n = 3 is evaluated as 
(B.13) 
Other useful formulas following from Wick rotations are 
and so on. 

B.3 Dimensional regularization 
Keep in mind that the Wick rotation is just a trick for evaluating integrals. There is 
nothing physical about it. In addition, note that the Wick rotation can only be justified if 
there are no new poles that invalidate the contour rotation. This caveat is only relevant for 
2-loop and higher integrals, which we will not encounter. 
B.3 Dimensional regularization 
The most important regularization scheme for modern applications is dimensional regular-
ization ['t Hooft and Veltman, 1972]. The key observation is that an integral such as 
(B.17) 
is divergent only if d ?: 4. If d < 4, then it will converge. If it is convergent we can 
Wick rotate, and the answer comes from analytically continuing all our formulas above to 
d dimensions. 
8.3.1 Spinor algebra 
In d dimensions, the metric is 
gILV = diag(1 -1 -1 ... -1) 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, 
(B.18) 
which means that there is exactly one timelike dimension in even non-integer d. This metric 
satisfies 
(B.19) 
The Lorentz-invariant phase space is 
(B.20) 
We can define spinor algebra to work the same way in d = 4 - c dimensions as in 
d = 4. More precisely, we assume there are d four-dimensional ,-matrices satisfying 
{,IL, ,V} = 2gILV. The identity matrix in spinor space satisfies Tr]a,8 = 4 as in four 
dimensions. In theories that involve ,5 we also assume such a matrix exists satisfying 
{,5,'/l} = O. 
(B.21) 
Theories with anomalies are the only places in which there can be subtleties with such a 
definition (see Chapter 30). An excellent discussion of spinors in various dimensions can 
be found in [Polchinski, 1998, Appendix B].

B.3.2 Scalar integrals 
We will manipulate the expressions so that they are only functions of the magnitude of k. 
Then we will use 
(B.22) 
where dnd denotes the differential solid angle of the d-dimensional unit sphere. Explicitly, 
dnd = sind- 2(¢d_l) sind- 3(¢d_2)'" sin(¢2) d¢l'" d¢d- l, 
(B.23) 
where ¢i is the angle to the i th axis, with 0 :s: ¢I < 27T and 0 :s: ¢i < 7T for i > l. For 
example, dn2 = d¢. For d = 3, we normally write ¢I = ¢ and ¢2 = () giving 
dn3 = d cos () d¢, 
(B.24) 
which is the usual volume element of a two-dimensional surface. Remember, d is the 
dimension of the solid volume, not the surface, which has dimension d - l. The (d - 1)-
dimensional surface areas of a ball of radius 1 in integer dimensions are 
0,2 = jdn2 = 27T (circle), jdn3 = 47T (sphere), jdn4 = 27T2 (three-sphere),' .. ,

nd = 21f!! Jo d¢n sinn- I¢n = 27T !! v0T r(~)

(B.29) 
Using r(l) = 1, this reproduces Eq. (B.28). 
In these expressions, r(x) is the Gamma function, which is the analytic continuation 
of the factorial. For integer arguments, it evaluates to 
r(l) = 1, r(2) = 1, r(3) = 2, 
r(x) = (x - 1)1 
(B.30) 

8.3 Dimensional regularization 
f(z) has simple poles at 0 and all the negative integers. We will often need to expand f(x) 
around the pole at x = 0:

This last integral is convergent in d = 4; however, the d-dimensional form is important for 
loops with IR divergences (see Chapter 20). 
All dimensionally regulated versions of divergent integrals will have poles at d = 4. 
Therefore, we often expand d = 4 - s and drop terms of order s. Another common con-
vention is d = 4 - 2s. If you are ever off by a factor of 2 in comparing to someone else's 
result, check the convention! 
8.3.3 Field dimensions 
Next, we should calculate the dimensions of all the fields and couplings in the Lagrangian. 
For the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density should have mass dimension d. 
For example, in QED, the Lagrangian is

LQED = -4(aILAv - avAIL) + 1/J(2'YlLalL - m)1/J - e1/J'YIL1/JAIL , 
(BAO) 
which implies the mass dimensions 
[Av] = d; 2, [1/J] = d; 1, 
[m] = 1, 
(BAI) 
and also [e] = 4;d. However, rather than have a non-integer dimensional coupling, it is 
conventional to take 
ol - d 
e -7 fJ.-2- e, 
(BA2) 
where p. is an arbitrary parameter of mass dimension 1. Then e remains dimensionless. 
One usually only makes this change for the factors of e (or other gauge couplings) 
directly participating in a loop. If a loop graph is not one-particle irreducible, there may 
be other factors of e for which it is often simpler to leave four-dimensional. This is just a 
convention. If all factors of e are modified as in Eq. (BA2), the answer will still be Cor-
rect, but may contain awkward logarithms of dimensionful scales when expanded around 
d = 4. These awkward logarithms drop out of physical quantities, of course, but they can 
be avoided at intermediate steps as well by only adding factors of fJ. to coupling constants 
participating in the loop. 
The factors of p. coming from Eq. (B.42) modify loop integrals as

(27r)d (P - 6.. + ic)2' 
(BA3) 
Keep in mind that fJ. is not a large scale. It is not a UV cutoff. The dimensional regular-
ization is removed when d -7 4, not when fJ. -7 00. Thus, fJ. is not like the Pauli-Villars 
mass M or a generic UV scale A. In fact, we will often use fJ. as a proxy for a physi-
cal infrared scale associated with a renormalization group point. Nevertheless, there are 
two unphysical parameters in dimensional regularization, c: and p.; both must drop out of 
physical predictions. 
Including this factor of fJ., the logarithmically divergent integral becomes

The 'YE comes from the integral J d:4k, the 47r comes from the phase space (2;)d and the 
fJ. comes from the p.4-d. This combination, 47re-I'E p.2, shows up frequently, so we give it 
a symbol 
(B.46) 
leading to 
(B.47) 

B.3 Dimensional regularization 
Sometimes we will omit the tilde and just write /-L for fl. Note that there is still a divergence 
in this expression as c ~ O. 
Dimensional regularization characterizes the degree to which integrals diverge at high 
energy through analytic properties of regulated results, rather than through powers of a 
cutoff scale. For example, the integral J (k2d~~)2 is logarithmically divergent. In d dimen-
sions, the equivalent integral J (i~~)2 rv r( 4;d) has a simple pole at d = 4, and 
no other poles for d < 4. A quadratically divergent integral, such as J k~~~' becomes 
J k~~k6. rv r( 2;d) in d dimensions. Expanding this result around d = 4 gives a ~ pole as 
did the expansion of the logarithmically divergent integral. However, this does not mean 
that power divergences are absent with dimensional regularization. Rather they are hidden, 
as poles in integer d < 4. For example, the quadratic divergence translates to a pole in 
r( 2;d) at d = 2. Thus, dimensional regularization translates the degree of divergence into 
the singularity structure of amplitudes in d dimensions. 
Dimensional regularization can also be used to regulate IR-divergent integrals. For 
example, J ddk(k2_~2)k4 is IR divergent for d < 4. We can evaluate this integral in 
d = 4 - c dimensions with c < 0 instead of c > O. A nice feature of dimensional 
regularization as an IR regulator is that it can be used for both virtual graphs and phase 
space integrals. 
Occasionally when using dimensional regularization we encounter an integral that is 
both UV and IR divergent; for example, the scaleless integral J d:"k. This integral is not 
convergent for any d. Nevertheless, it is useful to be able to do such integrals. To progress, 
we can introduce an arbitrary scale A to divide the UV and IR regions of Euclidean 
momenta: 
(B.48) 
where we have written d = 4 - c IR for the first integral, assuming c IR < 0, and d = 
4 - c uv for the second integral, assuming c uv > O. Rather than doing this split for 
every scaleless integral, since we know c IR and c uv must vanish from physical quantities, 
we often just set c IR = c uv = c. When this is done, the integral is just O. A simpler 
justification is that since there is no available quantity with non-zero mass dimension, 
scaleless integrals such as J d:4k must vanish in d dimensions. 
Often we are interested in just the UV divergence of an integral, which can be extracted 
from a scaleless integral as

This is a very useful shortcut to extracting the UV divergence. 
829 

830 
Regularization 
8.3.4 kJ..t integrals 
We will often have integrals with factors of momenta, such as kJ.' kl/, in the numerator: 
(B.50) 
These can be simplified using a trick. Since the integral is a tensor under Lorentz transfor-
mations but only depends on the scalar 6., it must be proportional to the only tensor around, 
gl-'I/. Then, just by dimensional analysis, we must get the same thing as in an integral with 
kJ.' kl/ replaced by ck2 gJ.'1/ for some number '. Contracting with gl-'I/, we see that c = ~ or 
more generally c = 
~. Therefore, 
(B.5l) 
If there is just one factor of kl-' in the numerator, for example in 
(B.52) 
then the integrand is antisymmetric under k -7 -k. Since we are integrating over all k, 
the integral must vanish. So we will only need to keep terms with even powers of k in the 
numerator. 
8.4 Other regularization schemes 
While dimensional regularization has a number of important advantages (it respects gauge 
invariance, it can regulate IR or UV divergences, no new fields are needed, etc.), it has 
the disadvantage of being unphysical. That is, one cannot think of analytical continuation 
into 4 - c dimensions as representing some sort of short-distance deformation. A number 
of regulators that do have short-distance interpretations, such as the hard cutoff regulator 
or heat-kernel regulator, are discussed in Chapter 15 in the context of the Casimir effect. 
Those regulators are unfortunately not useful for general field theory calculations. Here 
we discuss two regulation schemes that do have widespread applicability, the derivative 
method and Pauli-Villars regularization, and briefly mention a few more. 
8.4.1 Derivative method 
A quick way to extract the UV divergence of an integral is by taking derivatives. Consider 
a logarithmically divergent integral, such as 
(B.53) 

B.4 Other regularization schemes 
If we take the derivative, the integral can be done: 
d

(B.54) 
(B.55) 
where A is an integration constant representing the UV cutoff and is formally infinite. 
Similarly, for a quadratically divergent integral, one could take the second derivative and 
then integrate twice to give 
i 
( 
/:}. 
2) 
= - 811"2 
/:}'In Ai + A2 
(B.56) 
for two integration constants Al and A2 . 
The derivative method is not an ideal regulator. Since the cutoff A appears as a constant 
of integration, there is no way to relate A from one integral to A from another. In particular, 
cancellations that we expect due to constraints such as gauge invariance are not guaranteed 
to hold. Nevertheless, the derivative method is a quick way to check the coefficient of the 
logarithms appearing in any particular integral. 
8.4.2 Pauli-Villars regularization 
Pauli-Villars regularization requires that for each particle of mass m a new unphysical 
ghost particle of mass A be added with either the wrong statistics or the wrong-sign 
kinetic term. These new particles are designed to cancel exactly loop amplitudes with phys-
ical particles at asymptotically large loop momentum. For example, one can write down a 
Pauli-Villars Lagrangian for QED, which works at the I-loop level, as 
1 2

with A" the ghost photon and W the ghost electron and F"v = o"Av - OvA", We assume 
that both the ghost photon and ghost electron have bosonic statistics; the ghost photon has 
a wrong-sign kinetic term. 
For example, .cpv leads to a Feynman-gauge ghost-photon propagator of the form 
~ 
~

ip(xy) 
ig"V 
(OiT{A,,(x)Av(y)}i O) -
(211")4 e 
p2A2 + ic' 
(B.58) 
Since this has the opposite sign from the photon propagator, it will cancel the photon's 
contribution, for example, to the electron self-energy loop for loop momenta k" » A (see 
Chapter 18). The sign of the residue of the propagator is normally dictated by unitarity - a 
particle whose propagator has the sign in Eq.(B.58) has negative norm, and would generate 
probabilities greater than 1. SO, A" cannot create or destroy physical on-shell particles. 
Thus, fields such as A" are said to be associated with Pauli-Villars ghosts. The ghost 
electron propagator is the same as the regular electron propagator; however, ghost electron 
831 

832 
Regularization 
loops do not get a factor of -1 (since they are bosonic) and therefore cancel regular electron 
loops when kll- » A. 
In more detail, an amplitude with Pauli-Villars regularization will sum over the real 
particle, with mass m, and the ghost particle, with fixed large mass A » m: 
For k » A, m both terms in the new integrand scale as ~ and so the integrand vanishes 
at least as k16 making the integral convergent. We can now perform this integral by Wick 
rotation 
(B.60) 
so that 
(B.61) 
Note that the coefficient of the logarithm is consistent with what we found using the 
derivative method, in Eq. (B.SS) and with derivational regularization in Eq. (B.47). 
When using Pauli-Villars regularization, the identity 
1 
(B.62) 
is often useful. It allows us to evaluate divergent integrals by squaring the propagator and 
adding an integration parameter 3. In fact, due to the identity 
J 2d[ 1] J 21 
dm dm2 k2 _ m2 = 
dm (k2 - m2 )2 , 
(B.63) 
Pauli-Villars can be viewed as a systematic implementation of the derivative method. 
Pauli-Villars was historically important and serves a useful pedagogical function. 
Indeed, the introduction of Pauli-Villars ghosts is much more clearly a deformation in 
the UV, relevant at energy scales of order the Pauli-Villars mass or larger, than analyti-
cally continuing to 4 -
E: dimensions. However, in modern applications, Pauli-Villars is 
only occasionally useful. The.problem is that complicated multi-loop diagrams necessitate 
many fictitious particles (one for each real particle will not do it; the Lagrangian 1: PV only 
works at I-loop). Thus, Pauli-Villars quickly becomes impractical. In addition, it is not 
useful in non-Abelian gauge theories, since a massive gauge boson breaks gauge invari-
ance. (Pauli-Villars does work in an Abelian theory, at least at I-loop, as long as the gauge 
boson couples to a conserved current.) 

Problems 
8.4.3 Other regulators 
There are several other regulators that are sometimes used: 
• Hard cutoff: kE < A. This breaks Lorentz invariance, and usually every symmetry in 
the theory, but is perhaps the most intuitive regularization procedure. 
• Point splitting. Divergences at k -t 00 correspond to two fields approaching each other 
Xl ---7 X2. Point splitting puts a lower bound on this, Ixi' - x~ I > iEl" I. This also breaks 
translation invariance and is impractical for gauge theories, but is useful in theories with 
composite operators. 
• Lattice regularization. Although a lattice breaks both translation invariance and Lorentz 
invariance, it is possible to construct a lattice such that translation and Lorentz invariance 
are restored in the continuum limit (see Section 25.5).

"Once in a generation particle physicists elevate a quantum field theory text to the rank 
of classic. Two such classics are the texts by Bjorken and Drell and Peskin and Schroeder; 
it wouldn't surprise me if this new book by Schwartz joins this illustrious group." 
Mark Wise, California Institute of Technology 
"A wonderful tour of quantum field theory from the modern perspective, filled with insights 
on both the conceptual underpinnings and the concrete, elegant calculational tools of 
the subject." 
Nima Arkani-Hamed, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton 
"Schwartz has produced a new and valuable introduction to quantum field theory. He has 
rethought the whole presentation of the subject, from the introductory and foundational 
concepts to new developments such as effective field theory descriptions of quark dynamics." 
Michael E. Peskin, SLAC, Stanford 
"Schwartz's book grew out of a popular year-long course in quantum field theory at Harvard 
... That the book is neither superficial nor impossibly dense is rather remarkable and makes it 
easy to understand the course's success." 
Howard Georgi, Harvard University 
"In this book, Schwartz gives a thoughtful and modern treatment of many classical and 
contemporary topics. Students and experienced researchers will find much here of value." 
Edward Witten, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton 
Providing a modern introduction 
to quantum field theory, this 
comprehensive textbook develops the 
Standard Model of particle physics and 
explains state-of-the-art techniques 
for performing precision theoretical 
calculations. 
• 
Intuitive physical discussions of abstract 
concepts make quantum field theory 
accessible to students from a variety of 
backgrounds and interests. 
• 
Provides complete coverage, from quantum 
electrodynamics to the discovery of the 
Higgs boson. 
• 
Modern approaches, such as renormalization 
group methods and effective field theory, 
playa prominent role. 
• 
Assumes only an undergraduate-level 
understanding of quantum mechanics. 
• 
Numerous worked examples and end-of-
chapter problems enable students to 
reproduce classic results and to master 
quantum field theory.
