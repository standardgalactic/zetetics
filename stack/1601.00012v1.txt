Abstract
The numerical analysis of a family of distributed mixed optimal
control problems governed by elliptic variational inequalities (with pa-
rameter α > 0) is obtained through the ﬁnite element method when
its parameter h →0. We also obtain the limit of the discrete optimal
control and the associated state system solutions when α →∞(for
each h > 0) and a commutative diagram for two continuous and two
discrete optimal control and its associated state system solutions is
obtained when h →0 and α →∞. Moreover, the double convergence
is also obtained when (h, α) →(0, ∞).

Introduction
Following [8], we consider a bounded domain Ω⊂Rn whose regular bound-
ary ∂Ω= Γ1
S Γ2 consists of the union of two disjoint portions Γ1 and Γ2
with meas(Γ1 )> 0, and we state, for each α > 0, the following free boundary
system:
u ≥0; u(−∆u −g) = 0; −∆u −g ≥0 in Ω;
(1.1)
−∂u
∂n = α(u −b) on Γ1; −∂u
∂n = q on Γ2;
(1.2)
where the function g in (1.1) can be considered as the internal energy in Ω,
α > 0 is the heat transfer coeﬃcient on Γ1, b > 0 is the constant environment

temperature, and q is the heat ﬂux on Γ2. The variational formulation of
the above problem is given as ( system (Sα)):
Find u = uαg ∈K+ such that, ∀v ∈K+
aα(uαg, v −uαg) ≥(g, v −uαg)H −(q, v −uαg)Q + α(b, v −uαg)R,
(1.3)
where
V = H1(Ω),
K+ = {v ∈V : v ≥0 in Ω},
H = L2(Ω), Q = L2(Γ2), and R = L2(Γ1),
(u, v)H =

and
aα(u, v) = a(u, v) + α(u, v)R.
(1.4)
We note that a1, and therefore aα, is a bilinear, continuous, symmetric and
coercive form on V [25, 34], that is to say: there exists a constant λ1 > 0
and 0 < λα = λ1 min{1, α} such that
aα(v, v) ≥λα ∥v∥2

∀v ∈V.
(1.5)
In [8] the following family of continuous distributed optimal control problem
associated with the system (Sα) was considered for each α > 0:
Problem (Pα): Find the distributed optimal control gopα ∈H such that
Jα(gopα) = min
g∈H Jα(g)
(1.6)
where the quadratic cost functional Jα : H →R+
0 was deﬁned by:
Jα(g) = 1
2∥uαg∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H
(1.7)
with M > 0 a given constant and uαg is the corresponding solution of the
elliptic variational inequality (1.3) associated to the control g ∈H.

Several optimal control problems are governed by elliptic variational
inequalities ([1],[2],[3],[5],[6], [13],[14],[27],[31],[32],[39]) and there exists an
abundant literature about continuous and numerical analysis of optimal
control problems governed by elliptic variational equalities or inequalities
([4],[10],[11],[15],[16], [17],[18],[19],[20], [21],[22], [23],[24],[26], [29],[30],[35],
[36],[40]) and by parabolic variational equalities or inequalities ([7], [28]).
The objective of this work is to make the numerical analysis of the con-
tinuous optimal control problem (Pα) which is governed by the elliptic vari-
ational inequality (1.3) by proving the convergence of a discrete solution to
the solution of the continuous optimal control problem.
In Section 2, we establish the discrete elliptic variational inequality (2.3)
which is the discrete formulation of the continuous elliptic variational in-
equality (1.3), and we obtain that these discrete problem has unique so-
lutions for all positive h. Moreover, we deﬁne a family (Phα) of discrete
optimal control problems (2.8) and, we obtain several properties for the
state system (2.3) and for the discrete cost functional Jhα deﬁned in (2.7).
In Section 3, on adequate functional spaces, we obtain a result of global
strong convergence when the parameter h →0 (for each α > 0) and when
α →∞(for each h > 0) for the discrete state sytems and for the discrete
optimal optimal problem corresponding to (Pα). We end this work prov-
ing the double convergence of the discrete optimal solutions of (Phα) when
(h, α) →(0, ∞) obtaining a complete commutative diagram among two dis-
crete and two continuous optimal control problems given en Fig. 1. We
generalize recent results obtained for optimal control problems governed by
elliptic variational equalities given in [37, 38].

Properties of the discretization of the problem
(Pα)
Let Ω⊂Rn be a bounded polygonal domain; b a positive constant and τh
a regular triangulation with Lagrange triangles of type 1, constituted by
aﬃne-equivalent ﬁnite elements of class C0 over Ωbeing h the parameter
of the ﬁnite element approximation which goes to zero ([9], [12]). We take
h equal to the longest side of the triangles T ∈τh and we can approximate
the sets V and K+ by:
Vh = {vh ∈C0(Ω) : vh/T ∈P1(T), ∀T ∈τh},
K+h = {vh ∈Vh : vh ≥0 in Ω}
3

where P1(T) is the set of the polynomials of degree less than or equal to
1 in the triangle T.
Let Πh : C0(Ω) →Vh be the corresponding linear
interpolation operator and c0 > 0 a constant (independent of the parameter
h) such that, if 1 < r ≤2 ([9]):
∥v −Πh(v)∥H ≤c0 hr ∥v∥r ∀v ∈Hr(Ω),
(2.1)
∥v −Πh(v)∥V ≤c0 hr−1 ∥v∥r ∀v ∈Hr(Ω).
(2.2)
The discrete formulation (Shα) of the continuous system (Sα) is, for each
α > 0 , deﬁned as: Find uhαg ∈K+h such that, for all vh ∈K+h
aα(uhαg, vh −uhαg) ≥(g, vh −uhαg)H −(q, vh −uhαg)Q + α(b, vh −uhαg)R.
(2.3)
Theorem 2.1. Let g ∈H and q ∈Q be, then there exists unique solution
of the elliptic variational inequality (2.3).
Proof. It follows from the application of Lax-Milgram Theorem ([25], [27]).
Lemma 2.1. A) Let gn and g ∈H, and uhαgn and uhαg ∈K+h be the
associated solutions of the system (Shα) for each α > 0. If gn ⇀g in H
weak, then we have that:
i) ∃C > 0 (independent of h, α and of n) such that:
∥uhαgn∥V ≤C;
(2.4)
ii) ∀h > 0,
limn→∞∥uhαgn −uhαg∥V = 0.
(2.5)
B) We have that
∥uhαg2 −uhαg1∥V ≤1
λα
∥g2 −g1∥H
where uhαgi is the associated solution of the system (Shα) for gi, i = 1, 2.
Proof. We follow a similar methodology as in ([16], [33]).

Lemma 2.2. Let uαg ∈K+
T Hr(Ω), (1 < r ≤2) and uhαg ∈K+h be the
solutions of the elliptic variational inequalities (1.3) and (2.3) respectively
for the control g ∈H, there exists a positive constant C such that
∥uhαg −uαg∥V ≤C(α)h(r−1)/2.
(2.6)
Proof. If we consider v = uhαg ∈K+h ⊂K+ in the elliptic variational in-
equality (1.3) and vh = Πh(uαg) ∈K+h in (2.3), and calling w = Πh(uαg) −
uαg, we have that:
aα(uhαg −uαg, uhαg −uαg) ≤aα(uhαg, w) −(g, w)H + (q, w)Q −α(b, w)R
By using the coerciveness of aα, the estimation (2.2) and by some mathe-
matical computation, we obtain that:
∥uhαg −uαg∥2
V ≤C
λα
∥Πh(uαg) −uαg∥V ≤C
λα
hr−1∥uαg∥r
Now, we consider the continuous optimal control problem which was
established in (1.6). The associated discrete cost functional Jhα : H →R+
0
is deﬁned by the following expression:
Jhα(g) = 1
2∥uhαg∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H
(2.7)
where uhαg is the unique solution of the elliptic variational inequality (2.3)
for a given control g ∈H and a given parameter α > 0. Then, we estab-
lish the following discrete distributed optimal control problem (Phα): Find
gophα ∈H such that
Jhα(gophα) = min
g ∈H Jhα(g).
(2.8)
We remark that the discrete (in the space) distributed optimal control prob-
lem (Phα) is still an inﬁnite dimensional optimal control problem since the
control space H is not discretized.
Theorem 2.2. For the control g ∈H, the parameters α > 0 and h > 0, we
have:
a)
lim
∥g∥H→∞Jhα(g) = ∞.
5

b) Jhα(g) ≥
M
2 ∥g∥2
H −C ∥g∥H
for some constant C independent of
h > 0.
c) The functional Jhα is a lower weakly semi-continuous application in
H.
d) For each h > 0 and α > 0, there exists a solution of the discrete
distributed optimal control problem (2.8).
Proof. From the deﬁnition of Jhα(g) we obtain a) and b).
c) Let gn ⇀g in H weak, then by using the equality ∥gn∥2
H = ∥gn−g∥2
H−
∥g∥2
H + 2(gn, g)H we obtain that ∥g∥H ≤lim infn→∞∥gn∥H. Therefore, we
have
lim inf
n→∞Jhα(gn) ≥1
2∥uhαg∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H = Jhα(g).
d) It follows from [27].
Lemma 2.3. If the continuous state system has the regularity uαg ∈Hr(Ω)
(1 < r ≤2) for g ∈H and α > 0, then we have the following estimation
∀g ∈H:
|Jhα(g) −Jα(g)| ≤C(α)h
r−1
2
(2.9)
where C is a positive constant independent of h > 0.
Proof. By deﬁnition of the discrete cost functional Jhα, we have:
Jhα(g)−Jα(g) = 1
2 (∥uhαg∥2
H−∥uαg∥2
H) = 1
2∥uhαg−uαg∥2
H + (uαg, uhαg−uαg)H
and therefore, if we apply (2.6), it results:
|Jhα(g)−Jα(g)| ≤(1
2∥uhαg −uαg∥H + ∥uαg∥H) ∥uhαg −uαg∥H≤C(α) h
r−1
2 ,
and (2.9) holds.

Results of Convergence
3.1
Convergence when h →0
Theorem 3.1. Let uαg ∈K+
T Hr(Ω), (1 < r ≤2) and uhαg ∈K+h be the
solutions of the elliptic variational inequalities (1.3) and (2.3) respectively
for the control g ∈H, then uhαg →uαg in V when h →0+.
Proof. Similarly to the part a) of the Lemma 2.1, we can show that there
exist a constant C > 0 such that ∥uhαg∥V ≤C,
∀h > 0. Therefore, we
conclude that there exists ηα ∈V so that uhαg ⇀ηα in V (in H strong)
as h →0+ and η ∈K+. On the other hand, given v ∈K+ let be vh =
Π(v) ∈K+h for each h such that vh →v in V when h goes to zero. Now,
by considering vh ∈K+h in the discrete elliptic variational inequality (2.3)
we get:
aα(uhαg, vh−uhαg) ≥(g, vh−uhαg)H−(q, vh−uhαg)Q+α(b, vh−uhαg)R (3.1)
and when we pass to the limit as h →0+ in (3.1) by using that the bilinear
form a is lower weak semi-continuous in V , we obtain:
aα(ηα, v −ηα) ≥(g, v −ηα)H −(q, v −ηα)Q + α(b, v −ηα)R,
∀v ∈K+
and from the uniqueness of the solution of the discrete elliptic variational
inequality (1.3), we obtain that η = uαg.
Now, we will prove the strong convergence. As consequence of Lemma 2.2,
by passing to the limit when h →0+ in the inequality (2.6), it results:
lim
h→0+ ∥uhαg −uαg∥V = 0.
Henceforth we will consider the following:
Deﬁnition Given µ ∈[0, 1] and g1, g2 ∈H, we deﬁne:
a) the convex combinations of two data g1 and g2 as
g3(µ) = µ g1 + (1 −µ)g2 ∈H,
(3.2)
b) the convex combination of two discrete solutions
uhα3(µ) = µ uhαg1 + (1 −µ)uhαg2
∈K+h
(3.3)
7

c) and uhα4(µ) as the associated discrete state system which is the solu-
tion of the discrete elliptic variational inequality (2.3) for the control
g3(µ).
Following the idea given in [8, 33] we deﬁne two open problems. Given the
controls g1, g2 ∈H,
a)
0 ≤uhα4(µ) ≤uhα3(µ) in Ω,
∀µ ∈[0, 1], ∀h > 0,
(3.4)
b)
∥uhα4(µ)∥H ≤∥uhα3(µ)∥H
∀µ ∈[0, 1], ∀h > 0.
(3.5)
Remark 1: We have that (3.4) ⇒(3.5).
Remark 2: If (3.4) (or (3.5)) is true, then the functional Jhα is H-elliptic
and a strictly convex application because we have:
i)
∥g3µ∥2
H= µ∥g1∥2
H+(1−µ)∥g2∥2
H−µ(1−µ)∥g2 −g1∥2
H ∀g1, g2 ∈H, ∀µ ∈[0, 1]
ii)
∥uhα3(µ)∥2
H= µ∥uhα1∥2
H+(1 −µ)∥uhα2∥2
H−µ(1 −µ)∥uhα2 −uhα1∥2
H
∀g1, g2 ∈H, ∀µ ∈[0, 1], ∀α > 0.
Then we get:
µJhα(g1) + (1 −µ)Jhα(g2) −Jhα(g3(µ))
= µ(1 −µ)
2
∥uhαg2−uhαg1∥2
H+M

H ≥
M
2 µ(1 −µ) ∥g2 −g1∥2
H > 0 ∀µ ∈(0, 1), g1 ̸= g2 ∈H
and therefore, the uniqueness for the discrete optimal control problem (Phα),
deﬁned in (2.8), holds.

Theorem 3.2. Let uαgop ∈K+ be the continuous state system associated
to the optimal control gopα ∈H which is the solution of the continuous
distributed optimal control problem (1.6).
If, for each h > 0, we choose
an discrete optimal control gophα ∈H which is a solution of the discrete
distributed optimal control problem (2.8) and its corresponding discrete state
system uhα gophα ∈K+h, we obtain that:
uhα gophα →uαgopα in V strong when h →0+,
(3.6)
and
gophα →gopα in H strong when h →0+.
(3.7)
Proof. Now, we consider a ﬁxed value of the heat transfer coeﬃcient α > 0.
Let be h > 0 and gophα a solution of (2.8) and uhαgophα its associated discrete
optimal state system which is the solution of the problem deﬁned in (2.3)
for each h > 0. From (2.7) and (2.8), we have that for all g ∈H
Jhα(gophα) = 1
2∥uhαgophα∥2
H + M
2 ∥gophα∥2
H ≤1
2∥uhαg∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H.
Then, if we consider g = 0 and uhα0 his corresponding associated state
system, it results that:
Jhα(gophα) = 1
2∥uhαgophα∥2
H + M
2 ∥gophα∥2
H ≤1
2∥uhα0∥2
H.
Since ∥uhα0∥H ≤C
∀h, then we can obtain:
∥uhαgophα∥H ≤C
∀h
(3.8)
and
∥gophα∥H ≤
1
√
M
∥uhα0∥H ≤
1
√
M
C
∀h.
(3.9)
If we consider vh = b ∈K+h in the inequality (2.3) for gophα we obtain,
because the coerciveness of the application aα:
∥uhαgophα∥V ≤C
(3.10)
where the constant C is independent of the parameter h y α > 0. Now we
can say that there exist ηα ∈V and fα ∈H such that uhαgophα ⇀ηα in
9

V weak (in H strong), and gophα ⇀fα in H weak when h →0+. Moreover,
ηα ∈K+.
Let given v ∈K+, by taking vh = Π(v) ∈K+h we know that vh →v in V
strong when h →0+. Then, if we consider the variational elliptic inequality
(2.3) for g = gophα we have, taking into account that the application aα is a
lower weak semi-continuous application in V , that:
aα(ηα, v −ηα) ≥(fα, v −ηα) −(q, v −ηα)Q + α(b, v −ηα)R,
∀v ∈K+
and by the uniqueness of the solution of the problem given by the elliptic
variational inequality (1.3), we deduce that ηα = uα fα.
By using that the functional cost Jα is semi-continuous in H weak (see [8])
and Theorem 3.1, it results that f = uαgopα and ηα = ugopα.
Now, we consider v = uhαgophα ∈K+h ⊂K+ in the system (Sα) with control
gopα, and vh = Πh(uαgopα) in the discrete system (Shα) for the control gophα
and deﬁne wh = uhαgophα −uαgopα. After some mathematical work, we obtain
that:
aα(wh, wh) ≤−aα(uhαgophα, Πh(uαgopα)−uαgopα)+(q, Πh(uαgopα)−uαgopα)Q
−α(b, Πh(uαgopα) −uαgopα)R + (gophα, Πh(uαgopα) −uhαgophα)H
−(gopα, wh)H.
From the coerciveness of the application aα, and uhαgophα →uαgopα in H and
Πh(uαgopα) →uαgopα in H, we obtain that ∥wh∥V →0 if h →0 and then
(3.6) it holds. Its easy to see that (3.7) holds too.
3.2
Convergence when α →∞
Now, under the same hypothesis in §1, we consider the following free bound-
ary system [8]:
u ≥0; u(−∆u −g) = 0; −∆u −g ≥0 in Ω;
(3.11)
u = b on Γ1; −∂u
∂n = q on Γ2;
(3.12)
10

where the function g in (3.11) can be considered as the internal energy in
Ω, b is the positive constant temperature on Γ1 and q is the heat ﬂux on
Γ2. The variational formulation of the above problem is given as (S): Find
ug ∈K such that
a(u, v −ug) ≥(g, v −ug)H −(q, v −ug)Q, ∀v ∈K
(3.13)
where
K = {v ∈V : v ≥0 in Ω, v/Γ1 = b}.
In [8], the following continuous distributed optimal control problem (P)
associated with the elliptic variational inequality (3.13) was considered: Find
the continuous distributed optimal control gop ∈H such that
J(gop) = min
g∈H J(g)
(3.14)
where the quadratic cost functional J : H →R+
0 is deﬁned by:
J(g) = 1
2∥ug∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H
(3.15)
with M > 0 a given constant and ug is the corresponding solution of the
elliptic variational inequality (3.13) associated to the control g ∈H.
Therefore, as in §2, we deﬁne the discrete variational inequality formulation
(Sh) of the system (S) as follows: Find uhg ∈Kh such that
a(uhg, vh −uhg) ≥(g, vh −uhg)H −(q, vh −uhg)Q ∀vh ∈Kh.
(3.16)
where
Kh = {vh ∈Vh : vh ≥0 in Ω, vh/Γ1 = b}
The corresponding discrete distributed optimal control problem (Ph) of
the continuous distributed optimal control problem (P) is deﬁned as: Find
the discrete distributed optimal control goph ∈H such that
Jh(goph) = min
g∈H Jh(g) = 1
2∥uhg∥2
H + M
2 ∥g∥2
H,
(3.17)
where uhg is the solution of the elliptic variational inequality (3.16).
Theorem 3.3. i) Let g ∈H, and q ∈Q be, then there exists unique solution
of elliptic variational inequality (3.16).
ii) There exists a solution of the discrete optimal control problem (3.17)
11

Proof. i) It follows from the application of Lax-Milgram Theorem [25], [27].
ii) It follows from [33].
Theorem 3.4. Let g ∈H, q ∈Q and h > 0 be, then we have
limα→∞∥uhαg −uhg∥V = 0.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we consider α > 1 and we deﬁne w =
uhαg −uhg ∈V . By deﬁnition of aα, we have:
aα(w, w) −a1(w, w) = (α −1)∥w∥2
R.
After mathematical work, we obtain that:
a1(w, w) ≤a1(w, w) + (α −1)∥w∥2
R ≤(g, w)H −(q, w)Q −a(uhg, w) (3.18)
and by coerciveness of a1 it results that:
∥uhαg −uhg∥2
R ≤
C
α −1
and uhαg →uhg in Γ1, when α →∞.
Moreover, as a consequence of (3.18), we obtain that ∥uhαg∥V ≤C (C
constant independent of α and h). Then, there exist η ∈V such that
uhαg ⇀η in V (in H strong).
Then, the strong convergence in V is obtained similarly to the one in The-
orem 3.1
Theorem 3.5. If, for each h > 0 we choose gophα ∈H a solution of the op-
timal control problem (Phα) and consider its respective discrete state system
uhα gophα ∈K+h the solution of (2.3), we obtain that:
uhα gophα →uhfh in V when α →∞,
(3.19)
and
gophα →fh in H when α →∞.
(3.20)
where fh ∈H is a solution of the discrete optimal control problem (Ph) and
uhfh is its corresponding discrete state system solution of the variational
inequality (3.16).
12

Proof. As in Theorem 3.2, the inequalities (3.8) and (3.9)hold. Now, con-
sidering vh = b in (2.3)(and we take α > 1 without loss of generality) for
the control gophα and wh = b −uhα gophα, we obtain:
aα(uhα gophα, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q + α(b, wh)R
that is to say:
a1(−wh, wh) + a1(b, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q + (α −1)∥wh∥R. (3.21)
By the coerciveness of the application a1, it results that:
∥uhα gophα∥V ≤C ∀α > 0.
(3.22)
Moreover,
∥uhα gophα∥R ≤
C
α −1 ∀α > 0.
(3.23)
Then, there exists fh ∈H and ηh ∈V (we can see that ηh ∈Kh) such that
gophα ⇀fh in H
(3.24)
and
uhα gophα ⇀ηh in V (in H strong)
(3.25)
Let be vh ∈Kh ⊂K+h and given wh = vh −uhα gophα, we have:
aα(uhα gophα, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q + α(b, wh)R
a(uhα gophα, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q + α(b −uhα gophα, wh)R
and because of (3.24), (3.25) and similar arguments given in Theorem 3.2,
and the fact that the application a is semi-continuous in V weak, we obtain
that ηh is a solution of (3.16) for the control fh.
Then (by item (i) in
Theorem 3.3), ηh = uhfh.
If we consider vh = uhfh ∈Kh ⊂K+h in (2.3) for the control gophα ∈H
and wh = uhfh −uhα gophα, then:
aα(uhα gophα, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q + α(b, wh)R
13

a1(wh, wh) ≤a1(uhfh, wh) −(gophα, wh)H + (q, wh)Q −α(b, wh)R +
(α −1)(uhαgophα, wh)R.
Again, as consequence of the coerciveness of the application a1 and by (3.24),
(3.25), it results (3.19).
Now we see that fh is a solution of (2.8): because of Theorem 2.2 (c),and
by the deﬁnition of optimum:
Jh(fh) ≤lim
α→∞Jhα(gophα) ≤lim
α→∞Jhα(g) ∀g ∈H
and by Theorem 3.4 we conclude that
Jh(fh) ≤Jh(g) ∀g ∈H.
Finally, we see that:
Jh(fh) ≤lim
α→∞Jhα(gophα) ≤Jh(g) ∀g ∈H
then, if we consider g = fh:
lim
α→∞Jhα(gophα) = Jh(fh)
and, because (3.19),
lim
α→∞∥gophα∥H = ∥f∥H.
(3.26)
Then, by using (3.24), (3.25), we obtain (3.20).
Now, following the idea given in [38] we have this ﬁnal theorem:
3.3
Double convergence when (h, α) →(0+, ∞)
Theorem 3.6. If, for each h > 0 we choose gophα ∈H a solution of the
optimal control problem (Phα) and we consider its respective discrete state
system uhα gophα ∈K+h, which is the unique solution of (2.3), we obtain
that:
uhα gophα →ugop in V when (h, α) →(0+, ∞),
(3.27)
and
14

gophα →gop in H
when (h, α) →(0+, ∞).
(3.28)
where gop ∈H is the solution of the optimal control problem (P) and ugop is
its corresponding state system solution of the variational inequality (3.13).
Proof. As in Theorem 3.2, we have (3.8), (3.9) and (3.10) and, in conse-
quence, there exist u∗∈V with u∗/Γ1 = b and g∗∈H such that:
uhαgophα ⇀u∗
(strong
in
H)
(3.29)
and
gophα ⇀g∗
(3.30)
when (h, α) →(0+, ∞) in both cases. Let be v ∈K such that v/Γ1 = b.
We consider vh = Πh(v) ∈K+h in the state system (2.3) and we deﬁne
wh = vh −uhαgophα. Then we obtain
a(uhαgophα, wh) ≥(gophα, wh)H −(q, wh)Q.
Because the application a is semi-continuous weak in V and wh −→v −u∗
in H when (h, α) →(0, ∞), it results that u∗is solution of (3.13). But this
problem has unique solution, then we conclude that u∗= ug∗Moreover, we
have that:
aα(uhαgophα −ug∗, uhαgophα −ug∗) ≤(gophα, uhαgophα −Π(ug∗))H
+(q, uhαgophα−Π(ug∗))Q+α(b, uhαgophα−Π(ug∗))R−aα(ug∗, uhαgophα−Π(ug∗))
+aα(uhαgophα, Π(ug∗) −ug∗) −aα(ug∗, Π(ug∗) −ug∗).
Beacause the coerciveness of the application aα in V and by (3.29) and
(3.30), we obtain (3.27) when (h, α) →(0+, ∞).
As the functional Jhα is lower weakly semi-continuous in H (Theorem
2.2) and (3.30) we obtain that gophα ⇀gop.
We also have that lim(h,α)→(0,∞)Jhα(gophα) = J(gop), and then
lim(h,α)→(0,∞)∥gophα∥H = ∥gop∥H, and by (3.30), (3.28) the thesis holds.

Conclusion
In conclusion, by using the previous results given in [8], and [33] we ob-
tain the following commutative diagram among the two continuous optimal
control problems (P) and (Pα), and two discrete optimal control problems
(Ph) and (Phα) when h →0, α →∞and (h, α) →(0+, ∞), which can be
summarized by the following ﬁgure (Fig. 1):
