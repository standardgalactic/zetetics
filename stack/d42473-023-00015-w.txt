Plants need nitrogen-rich 
soils to thrive, but there are 
a limited number of plants 
able to extract nitrogen gas 
from the atmosphere and fix 
it in a useful form in the soil. 
However, new kinds of crops 
capable of nitrogen fixation 
may soon be possible, after 
Japanese scientists successfully 
transferred nitrogen-fixing genes 
into a photosynthetic organism. 
Nitrogen fixation is a process 
that chemically converts 
molecular nitrogen to ammonia, 
a nitrogen compound plants 
can use, explains Yuichi 
Fujita, a biochemist at Nagoya 
University, which is about 
300 km west of Tokyo, Japan. 
Much of the world’s farming 
is currently supported by 
nitrogen-containing chemical 
fertilizers, but they are energy-
intensive to produce and can 
lead to algal blooms when runoff 
pollutes waterbodies.
Many of the plants capable 
of nitrogen fixation are legumes, 
members of the bean family, 
but it would be game changing 
to have a wider variety of crops 
with this capacity, says Fujita. 
His research is part of the 
COI-NEXT project, a bioplastic’s 
project led by Kanazawa 
University and the Japan 
Science and Technology Agency. 
Fujita’s research is focussed on 
the efficient production of crops 
that could be used as feedstock 
for bioplastics.
FRESH FIX
Legumes fix nitrogen through 
nodules that develop on their 
roots and host nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria, but conventional 
plant breeding, or even 
genetic engineering, hasn’t yet 
succeeded at transferring the 
ability for nitrogen fixation via 
symbiosis with bacteria to 
other crops. 
Fujita’s team are instead 
exploring how to genetically 
engineer this ability, and have 
started with cyanobacteria, 
which can draw energy from the 
sun through photosynthesis, as 
plants can. Cyanobacteria are 
microorganisms that are either 
a single-cell or composed of 
single connected ‘filamentous’ 
cells. These microorganisms 
bear similarities to chloroplasts, 
the organelles responsible for 
photosynthesis within plant cells.
Passing the ability to fix 
nitrogen on to new crops has 
been challenging. This is largely 
because the process is driven by 
an enzyme called nitrogenase, 
which breaks down easily in the 
presence of molecular oxygen, 
a compound abundant in plant 
cells and the atmosphere. 
“Since plants generate 
oxygen through photosynthesis, 
nitrogenase needs to be 
protected not only from 
atmospheric oxygen, but also 
from the oxygen produced 
within the plant cell,” says Fujita.  
As a first step, his team 
has engineered the genes for 
nitrogen fixation into certain 
cyanobacteria. This was an easier 
proposition than plants, because 
there were already cyanobacteria 
which produce nitrogenase.  
The researchers identified 50 
genes that code for nitrogenase 
and its closely related enzymes 
and proteins in a nitrogen-
fixing cyanobacterium called 
Leptolyngbya boryana. They 
then introduced some of these 
genes into the genome of 
another strain of cyanobacteria 
which didn’t have this ability, 
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, 
which subsequently was able to 
produce small amounts of the 
enzyme. 
FUTURE FIXATIONS 
The achievement is exciting, 
but such small quantities of 
nitrogenase can’t “support 
nitrogen-fixing growth in 
cyanobacteria,” says Fujita, “so 
we are trying to introduce other 
genes to enhance nitrogenase 
activity.” 
The team’s cyanobacteria 
success is only a first step, 
and there are many hurdles to 
overcome before nitrogenase 
genes might be engineered into 
crops such as sugar beet, rice 
and maize. 
Fujita says protecting 
nitrogenase from oxygen 
generated in plants cells 
might require engineering its 
production to only happen at 
night, while photosynthesis is 
paused; or for it to occur in the 
roots, where photosynthesis 
does not take place. 
 Nagoya University researchers have engineered nitrogen-fixing genes 
from a cyanobacterium (Leptolyngbya boryana, pictured) that already 
creates a key enzyme into one that does not.
A STEP CLOSER TO NEW 
NITROGEN-FIXING CROPS 
The transfer of genes that allow nitrogen to be fixed from the atmosphere into PHOTOSYNTHESIZING 
CYANOBACTERIA could one day lead to similarly engineered crops.
