Abstract
Bryophytes and vascular plants represent the broadest evolutionary divergence in the land plant lineage, and comparative 
analyses of development spanning this divergence therefore offer opportunities to identify truisms of plant develop-
ment in general. In vascular plants, organs are formed repetitively around meristems at the growing tips in response to 
positional cues. In contrast, leaf formation in mosses and leafy liverworts occurs from clonal groups of cells derived 
from a daughter cell of the apical stem cell known as merophytes, and cell lineage is a crucial factor in repetitive organ 
formation. However, it remains unclear whether merophyte lineages are a general feature of repetitive organ formation 
in bryophytes as patterns of organogenesis in thalloid liverworts are unclear. To address this question, we developed 
a clonal analysis method for use in the thalloid liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, involving random low-frequency 
induction of a constitutively expressed nuclear-targeted fluorescent protein by dual heat-shock and dexamethasone treat-
ment. M. polymorpha thalli ultimately derive from stem cells in the apical notch, and the lobes predominantly develop 
from merophytes cleft to the left and right of the apical cell(s). Sector induction in gemmae and subsequent culture 
occasionally generated fluorescent sectors that bisected thalli along the midrib and were maintained through several 
bifurcation events, likely reflecting the border between lateral merophytes. Such thallus-bisecting sectors traversed 
dorsal air chambers and gemma cups, suggesting that these organs arise independently of merophyte cell lineages in 
response to local positional cues.

Introduction
Land plant development is characterized by apical growth, 
in which stem cells residing in the shoot apical meristem 
produce new tissues and organs, and changes in stem cell 
and apical function are linked to the origin of three-dimen-
sional land plant forms and their subsequent diversification 
(reviewed in Harrison 2017; Moody 2020). Whilst bryophyte 
meristems are thought to have a single apical cell whose 
geometry and cleavage patterns determine organ position 
and plants’ overall body plan (Harrison et al. 2009; Pari-
har 1967), lycophyte and fern meristems have one to a few 
apical cells (Harrison and Langdale 2010; Harrison et al. 
2007; Sanders et al. 2011), and seed plants have multicel-
lular meristems (Korn 2001, 2002; Poethig 1987; Poethig 
and Szymkowiak 1995). Apical cell daughters in non-seed 
plants are called ‘merophytes’ and proliferate to form clon-
ally related cell groups (Douin 1925; Gifford 1983; Korn 
1993). In mosses and leafy liverworts, the apical cells pro-
duce merophytes which divide to generate leaves or tissues 
such as epidermis and parenchyma (Crandall-Stotler 1980; 
Harrison et al. 2009; Parihar 1967; Ruhland 1924). Thus, 
merophytes serve as a repeating unit of shoot formation, 
and cell lineage is manifest in organ and tissue development. 
In contrast to other bryophytes, thalloid liverworts have

flattened whole plant bodies in place of forming individual 
leaves (Crandall-Stotler 1981; Shimamura 2016), and pat-
terns of thallus development and organogenesis are unclear.
The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L. grows as 
a flattened creeping thallus that periodically bifurcates 
from the apical notch, which houses cuneate apical cell(s) 
(Fig. 1a, b; Shimamura 2016; Solly et al. 2017). The 
duration between consecutive notch bifurcation events is 
termed the “plastochron”, and plastochron 1 covers the 
period between gemma germination and the first bifurca-
tion (Fig. 1a; Solly et al. 2017). On the dorsal side of the 
thallus, an assimilation organ, the ‘air chamber’ (Fig. 1c), 
and a cup-shaped organ generating vegetative propagules, 
the ‘gemma cup’ (Fig. 1b, d), respectively develop repeti-
tively or periodically. Histological and anatomical stud-
ies have shown that air chamber formation begins with 
aperture formation at a distance from the apical cells, 
and then an intercellular space, the ‘air pore’ (Fig. 1c), 
forms between epidermal cells by cell separation (Fig. 1e; 
Apostolakos et al. 1982; Ishizaki et al. 2013). Though 
Apostolakos et al. (1982) concluded from observations of 
intercellular spaces at the corner of most epidermal cells 
in M. paleacea that air chambers have no distinct mother 
cell but develop from air pore cells surrounding the initial 
aperture, direct evidence supporting their conclusion is 
lacking. In contrast to air pores, gemma cup primordia are 
evident a few cells away from the apical cells in M. poly-
morpha (Fig. 1f; Barnes and Land 1908), suggesting that 
dorsal merophytes contribute to gemma cup development. 
Whether dorsal merophytes are the sole contributor, or 
other merophytes also contribute to gemma cup develop-
ment is unclear.
This lack of clarity around dorsal organogenesis is 
inherent in histological and anatomical approaches which 
capture static snapshots of a series of dynamic develop-
mental processes, and the difficulties in distinguishing

merophyte borders in fully developed tissues. In this study, 
we used clonal analysis to label cell lineages (Poethig 
1987), and found that both air chambers and gemma cups 
are formed across merophyte boundaries, suggesting that 
positional cues regulate organogenesis in the liverwort M. 
polymorpha.
Materials and methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
A male accession of M. polymorpha, Takaragaike-1 (Tak-1), 
was used as wild-type plants. M. polymorpha was cultured 
on half strength Gamborg’s B5 medium containing 1% agar 
under 50–60 µmol photons ­m−2 ­s−1 of continuous white fluo-
rescent light at 22 °C.
Plasmid construction and transformation
Plasmid pMpGWB337tdTN-GUS was generated by LR 
recombination between pMpGWB337tdTN (Sugano 
et al. 2018) and pENTR-gus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) using LR Clonase II (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and used for Agrobacterium-mediated transfor-
mation of Tak-1 thallus (Kubota et al. 2013).
proMpSYP13B:mTurquoise2-MpSYP13B vector was gen-
erated as described in Kanazawa et al. (2016). An mTur-
quoise2-coding sequence was amplified with a primer set, 
mTurquoise2_BamHI_IF_Fw (CCC​CTT​CAC​CGG​ATC​
ATG​GTG​TCT​AAG​GGT​GAG​GAA​C) and mTurquoise2_
BamHI_IF_Rv (GCT​GCC​GCC​GGA​TCC​TTT​GTA​AAG​
CTC​ATC​CAT​TCC​G), and then inserted into the BamHI-
digested proMpSYP13B:MpSYP13B entry vector (Kanazawa 
et al. 2016) using In-Fusion HD Cloning System (TaKaRa, 
Shiga, Japan). The resultant entry vector was introduced into 
pMpGWB101 (Ishizaki et al. 2015) by LR recombination, 
and then used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of 
pMpGWB337tdTN-GUS plant thallus (Kubota et al. 2013).
SEM imaging
SEM images were taken with 21-day-old Tak-1 thalli using 
TM3000 (Hitachi High Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) as 
described previously (Nishihama et al. 2015).
Clonal analysis and fluorescence observation
Cre induction on mature gemmae was performed as follows: 
gemmae on a plate were treated with 3 µL of a solution con-
taining 5 µM DEX, air dried for 10–20 min, and subjected 
to heat shock by incubating the plate in a 37 °C air incubator 
for various periods. Cre induction on thalli was performed as 
follows: 8-day-old thalli were vacuum-infiltrated in a solu-
tion containing 5 µM DEX, transplanted onto agar media, 
air dried for 10–20 min, and then heat-shocked in a 37 °C 
incubator for 35–50 min.
Sector-formed thalli were embedded in 6% agar block 
and sectioned into ~ 200-µm-thick slices with LinearSlicer 
Pro 7(DOSAKA EM, Kyoto, Japan). tdTomato, mTur-
quoise2, and bright field images in mature gemmae, 1-day-
old gemmalings, 6-day-old thalli, and sliced samples were 
captured with fluorescence microscope BZ-X710 (Key-
ence, Osaka, Japan) and merged after equal adjustment of 
contrast and brightness for visibility by the BZ-X Analyzer 
(Keyence). Thalli were observed with fluorescence dissec-
tion microscope Leica M205 C (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). 
Obtained images were manually merged by using ImageJ 
(https​://image​j.nih.gov/ij/) after contrast and brightness 
were adjusted for visibility. Contribution of tdTomato-
positive and -negative regions to a gemma cup was evalu-
ated by counting the number of serrations existing in each 
region.
Histochemical assay for GUS activity
Histochemical assay for GUS activity was performed as 
described previously (Ishizaki et al. 2012).
Results
Exploitation of clonal analysis system
To determine how dorsal structures develop, we first 
established a Cre-loxP based clonal sector induction sys-
tem (Fig. 2a). A construct was designed to constitutively 
express a floxed ß-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under the M. 
polymorpha EF1α promoter (proMpEF1α), and condition-
ally express a Cre-recombinase/glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR) fusion protein under an M. polymorpha heat-shock 
promoter, MpHSP17.8A1 (Fig. 2a; Nishihama et al. 2016). 
The rationale for sector induction was that, following heat 
shock and dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, the Cre pro-
tein would excise the GUS gene allowing expression of a 
nuclear targeted red fluorescent protein, tdTomato-NLS, 
under proMpEF1α (Sugano et al. 2018). Two elements to 
control conditional expression of the Cre gene were included 
to avoid leaky excision of the floxed region. This system was 
expected to mark clonal sectors negatively by the absence of 
GUS staining or positively by the presence of red fluorescent 
signal (Fig. 2b).
Clonal analysis requires the production of many sectors 
induced randomly at different stages of development, and

there is therefore an optimal frequency of sector induc-
tion. Whereas a low frequency of induction generates too 
few sectors to generate sufficient data for analysis, a high 
frequency of induction can induce overlapping sectors, 
becoming uninformative. To optimise the frequency of sec-
tor induction and analyse organogenesis in gemmalings and 
thalli, we first treated gemmae with a solvent control solu-
tion or a solution containing 5 µM DEX, and then heat-
shocked gemmae for different periods of time at 37 °C. We 
subsequently examined gemmae by fluorescence micros-
copy. The frequency of cells showing fluorescence in the 
gemma increased as the duration of the heat-shock increased 
in DEX-treated gemmae, but increased to a lesser extent in 
untreated gemmae such that sectors were absent in gemmae 
with no heat shock and present in almost all cells in gemmae 
that were heat-shocked for 80 min (Fig. 2c). A 30–40 min 
heat-shock induced sectors at a moderate frequency that was 
compatible with the requirements of clonal analysis, and was 
thus used in further experiments, unless otherwise noted.

Lateral merophytes bisect thallus lobes
Cre induction in mature gemmae and subsequent plant 
development caused sector formation in various patterns. 
Some sectors bisected the thallus lobe (Fig. 3), spanning the 
dorsal to ventral axis (Fig. 3a), and such sectors persisted 
through several bifurcation events with well-defined sharp 
borders (Fig. 3b), consistent with a lateral merophyte origin 
(see merophyte sectors in Harrison et al. 2007, 2009; Sand-
ers et al. 2011 for comparison).
Air pores are formed independently of merophye 
cell lineage
Observations of air chambers at sector junctions showed 
an overlap with the edge of some air chambers, but other 
air chambers were divided into fluorescence-positive and 
-negative regions (Fig. 4a). Whilst the former constituted 
approximately half of cases, amongst the latter, a pattern 
where the sector border was positioned in the centre of the 
air pore predominated, but in some cases sectors were off 
centre (Fig. 4b). Only small proportion of air chambers had 
sectors that did not cross the air pore (Fig. 4b). Observation 
in an early developmental stage revealed sectors that covered 
not only entire air chambers but also half air chambers with 
the sector border positioned in the centre of the air pore 
(Fig. 4c, d). These data suggest that air chambers can be 
formed either within a merophyte cell lineage or between 
merophyte cell lineages (see Fig. 7).
Gemma cups are a multi‑lineage‑comprised organ
Next, we observed gemma cups that had formed during the 
second to fourth plastochrons (Fig. 5a; Solly et al. 2017) on 
thalli with persistent bisecting sectors (Fig. 3b) and found 
that such gemma cups were also bisected by the sectors and 
sometimes contained both fluorescence-positive and -nega-
tive gemmae (Fig. 5b). Not only the wall, but also the floor

of gemma cups (where gemma initials arise) were separated 
by such sectors (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that gemma 
cups are not derived from a single merophyte, but multiple 
merophytes. Contribution of a fluorescence-positive region 
(or conversely a fluorescence-negative region) to a gemma 
cup varied depending on the timing of its formation relative 
to notch bifurcation; those formed during the second and 
fourth plastochrons showed a range of contributions from 
0 to 100%, while those formed during the third plastochron 
showed approximately 50% contribution (Fig. 5d). These 
results suggest that gemma cups initiate from two or more 
cells at the boundary between thallus lobes arising from lat-
eral merophytes, that the process of bifurcation has some 
inherent variability, and that positional cues are important 
in gemma cup development.
Gemma cup initials are first recognizable a few cells 
away from the apical cells (Barnes and Land 1908), and 
the dorsal merophyte is believed to participate in gemma 
cup development. However, this idea has never been dem-
onstrated experimentally. Because gemma cups are never 
formed during the first plastochron (Fig. 5a), we induced 
Cre-loxP recombination on 8-day-old thalli, during the 
second plastochron. Sectors that were several cells wide 
emerged along the midrib during the third plastochron. 
These line-shaped sectors were later separated from the api-
cal notches (Fig. 6a), and were only present on the dorsal 
surface (Fig. 6b), suggesting a dorsal merophyte origin. Such

sectors also overlapped with gemma cups (Fig. 6c), suggest-
ing a minor contribution of dorsal merophytes to gemma 
cup development. Taken together, these observations suggest 
that gemma cups arise from dorsal merophytes and dorsal 
derivatives of lateral merophytes (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Clonal analysis has considerably contributed to understand-
ing plant development. Methodologies for clonal analysis 
widely vary, involving ploidy changes induced by col-
chicine (Satina et al. 1940), activation of GUS transgene 
expression by random or heat-shock-mediated removal of 
transposons (Dolan et al. 1994; Kidner et al. 2000; Scheres 
et al. 1994), inactivation of GUS transgene expression by 
heat-shock-mediated Cre-loxP excision (Saulsberry et al. 
2002), pale green pigmentation or chloroplast biogen-
esis defects induced by X-ray irradiation (Harrison et al. 
2007, 2009), utilisation of variegated species (Sanders 
et al. 2011), and so on. This paper reports a new clonal 
analysis method for M. polymorpha, which we anticipate 
will contribute to understanding patterns of M. polymor-
pha development. For the purpose of lineage visualisation, 
our method could be further improved by incorporating a 
multi-colour system such as Brainbow (Livet et al. 2007) 
and Brother of Brainbow (Wachsman et al. 2011). Clonal 
analysis could be utilised to analyse gene functions in the 
context of specific cell lineages or positions (Heidstra et al. 
2004; Sieburth et al. 1998). By taking advantage of live 
imaging, our method could be widely applied to conditional 
genetic analyses using various molecular tools established 
in M. polymorpha (Ishizaki et al. 2015; Kopischke et al. 
2017; Mano et al. 2018; Nishihama et al. 2016; Sugano 
et al. 2018).
Here, Cre induction in mature gemmae and subsequent 
growth occasionally generated sectors that bisected thalli 
and were maintained through bifurcation events, and such 
sectors are likely to arise by Cre induction in lateral mero-
phytes or apical cells. Some air chambers on such sec-
tors were divided into fluorescence-positive and -negative 
regions (Fig. 4). Air chambers are known to arise from

initial apertures that are formed in the limited area around 
an apical cell, and aperture-surrounding cells later develop 
into air pores (Apostolakos et al. 1982). Our analysis dem-
onstrated that air pores could emerge across merophyte 
boundaries as well as within single merophytes, sug-
gesting that air pore formation does not depend on cell 
lineages but on local cues around the notch (Fig. 7). We 
further found that most air-chamber sectors traversed air 
pores, suggesting that cells that constitute air chambers 
are derived from initial aperture-surrounding cells, which 
is consistent with the conclusions by Apostolakos et al. 
(1982).
Gemma cups were also divided by thallus-bisecting sec-
tors (Fig. 5), suggesting that no single initial cell gives rise 
to gemma cups and that gemma cup development is con-
trolled by local cues. Our observations that the boundary 
of thallus-bisecting sectors represents the border of lateral 
merophytes and that dorsal merophyte sectors are incor-
porated into gemma cups (Fig. 6) demonstrate that gemma 
cups derive from both dorsal and lateral merophytes 
(Fig. 7). Though the mechanisms that allow lateral mero-
phytes to contribute differentially to gemma cup formation 
(Fig. 5d) are unclear, the degree of lateral proliferation of 
lateral and dorsal merophyte cells may vary depending on 
the plastochron, or due to plasticity. Recently, an R2R3-
type MYB transcription factor, GEMMA CUP-ASSOCI-
ATED MYB1 (GCAM1), was reported to play an essential 
role in gemma cup formation (Yasui et al. 2019). GCAM1 
is expressed in the notch and the gemma cup floor and is 
proposed to maintain dorsal cells near the apical cell in 
undifferentiated status for gemma cup formation (Yasui 
et al. 2019). Clarification of the early expression pattern of 
GCAM1 in relation to dorsal and lateral merophytes could 
provide clues to the mechanism of gemma cup formation.
In angiosperms, tissue and organ differentiation is 
based on cell fates that are determined by positional sig-
nals (Kidner et al. 2000; Reinhardt et al. 2005; Scheres 
2001; Scheres et al. 1994; Sussex 1951, 1954; van den 
Berg et al. 1995). Flow of the phytohormone auxin speci-
fies the site of cell differentiation for organ formation, such 
as leaves and lateral roots. Cell lineages also contribute to 
the formation of tissue layers, such as the tunica and cor-
pus layers of the shoot apical meristem and the radial lay-
ers of root tissues, but their identities are often specified 
by cell-cell communications with other lineage cells. In M. 
polymorpha, auxin signaling via transcriptional regulation 
plays critical roles in the development of gemmae through 
regulation of cell division patterns (Kato et al. 2017). The 
intermerophyte pattern of organogenesis revealed in this 
study suggests that similar local signal-mediated cell-fate 
determination operates in M. polymorpha. In contrast, 
lateral organs in leafy bryophytes arise from merophyte 
cell lineages with clear histological boundaries (Crandall-
Stotler 1980; Harrison et al. 2009; Parihar 1967; Ruhland

have led to the morphological diversification of complex 
thalloid liverworts.
