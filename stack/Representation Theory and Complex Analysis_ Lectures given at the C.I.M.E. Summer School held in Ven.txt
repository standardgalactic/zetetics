C.I.M.E. means Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo, that is, International Mathematical Summer
Center. Conceived in the early ﬁfties, it was born in 1954 and made welcome by the world mathematical
community where it remains in good health and spirit. Many mathematicians from all over the world
have been involved in a way or another in C.I.M.E.’s activities during the past years.
So they already know what the C.I.M.E. is all about. For the beneﬁt of future potential users and co-
operators the main purposes and the functioning of the Centre may be summarized as follows: every
year, during the summer, Sessions (three or four as a rule) on different themes from pure and applied
mathematics are offered by application to mathematicians from all countries. Each session is generally
based on three or four main courses (24−30 hours over a period of 6−8 working days) held from
specialists of international renown, plus a certain number of seminars.
A C.I.M.E. Session, therefore, is neither a Symposium, nor just a School, but maybe a blend of both.
The aim is that of bringing to the attention of younger researchers the origins, later developments, and
perspectives of some branch of live mathematics.
The topics of the courses are generally of international resonance and the participation of the courses
cover the expertise of different countries and continents. Such combination, gave an excellent opportu-
nity to young participants to be acquainted with the most advance research in the topics of the courses
and the possibility of an interchange with the world famous specialists. The full immersion atmosphere
of the courses and the daily exchange among participants are a ﬁrst building brick in the ediﬁce of
international collaboration in mathematical research.

Preface
This volume collects the notes of six series of lectures given on the occasion
of the CIME session Representation Theory and Complex Analysis held in
Venice on July 10–17, 2004. We thank Venice International University for its
hospitality at the beautiful venue of San Servolo island.
Our aim in organizing this meeting was to present the audience with a wide
spectrum of recent results on the subject of the title, ranging from topics with
an analytical ﬂavor, to more algebraic or geometric oriented ones, without
neglecting interactions with other domains, such as quantum computing.
Two papers present a general introduction to ideas and properties of analysis
on semi-simple Lie groups and their unitary representations. Michael Cowl-
ing presents a panorama of various interactions between representation the-
ory and harmonic analysis on semisimple groups and symmetric spaces. Un-
expected phenomena occur in this context, as for instance the Kunze–Stein
property, that reveal a dramatic diﬀerence between these groups and group
actions and the classical amenable group (an extension of abelian groups).
Results of this type are strongly related to the vanishing of coeﬃcients of uni-
tary representations. Complementarily, Alain Valette recalls the notion
of amenability and investigates its relations with vanishing of coeﬃcients of
unitary representations of semi-simple groups and with ergodic actions. He
applies these ideas to show another surprising property of representations of
semi-simple groups and their lattices, namely Margulis’ super-rigidity.
Three papers deal in full detail with the hard analysis of semisimple group
representations. Ideally, this analysis could be split into representations of
real groups or complex groups, or of algebraic groups over local ﬁelds. A
deep account of the interaction between the real and complex world is given
by Masaki Kashiwara, whose paper studies the relations between the
representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups and the (microlocal)
geometry of the ﬂag manifolds associated with the corresponding complex
algebraic groups. These results, a considerable part of which are joint work
with W. Schmid, were announced some years ago, and are published here in

Preface
complete form for the ﬁrst time. David Vogan expresses unitary represen-
tations of real or complex semi-simple groups using tools of complex analysis,
such as minimal globalizations realized on Dolbeault cohomology with com-
pact supports. Edward Frenkel describes the geometric Langlands corre-
spondence for complex algebraic curves, concentrating on the ramiﬁed case
where a ﬁnite number of regular singular points is allowed.
Finally, Nolan Wallach illustrates brieﬂy a surprising application that
could be relevant for the future of computing and its complexity: his paper
studies how representation theory is related to quantum computing, focusing
attention in particular on the study of qubit entanglement.
We wish to thank all the lecturers for the excellence of their live and written
contributions, as well as the many participants from all age ranges and parts
of the world, who created a very pleasant working atmosphere.

Applications of Representation Theory
to Harmonic Analysis of Lie Groups (and Vice
Versa)
Michael Cowling
School of Mathematics, University of New South Wales, UNSW Sydney 2052,
Australia
michaelc@maths.unsw.edu.au
These notes began as lectures that I intended to deliver in Edinburgh in April,
1999. Unfortunately I was not able to leave Australia at the time. Since then
there has been progress on many of the topics, some of which is reported here,
and I have added another lecture, on uniformly bounded representations, so
that these notes are expanded on the original version in several ways.
I have tried to make these notes an understandable introduction to the
subject for mathematicians with little experience of analysis on Lie groups
or Lie theory. I aimed to present a wide panorama of diﬀerent aspects of
harmonic analysis on semisimple groups and symmetric spaces, and to try
to illuminate some of the links between these aspects; I may well not have
succeeded in this aim. Many readers will ﬁnd much of what is written here to
be elementary, and others may well disagree with my perspective. I apologise
in advance to both the neophytes for whom my outline is too sketchy and to
the experts for whom these notes are worthless.
I had hoped to produce an extensive bibliography, but I have not found
the time to do so. Consequently I must bear the responsibility for the many
omissions of important references in the subject.
Whoever wishes to delve into this subject more deeply will need a more
complete introduction. There are many possibilities; the books of S. Helga-
son [59, 60, 62] and of A.W. Knapp [71] come to mind immediately as essential
reading.

1 Basic Facts of Harmonic Analysis on Semisimple
Groups and Symmetric Spaces
I will deal with noncompact classical algebraic semisimple Lie groups, such as
SO(p, q), SU(p, q), Sp(p, q), SL(n, R), SL(n, C), and SL(n, H). The deﬁnitions
of these may be found in [59, pp. 444–447] or [71, pp. 3–6].
All noncompact algebraic semisimple Lie groups have various standard
subgroups and decompositions. I begin by describing these, then describe
families of unitary representations parametrised by representations of some
of these subgroups. Finally, I discuss the Plancherel formula. The fact that
most of the important representations are parametrised by representations of
subgroups allows arguments involving induction on the rank of the group.
1.1 Structure of Semisimple Lie Algebras
First, ﬁx a Cartan involution θ of the Lie algebra g of the group G, and write
k and p for the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of θ. Then k is a maximal compact
subalgebra of g, and p is a subspace; [X, Y ] ∈k for all X, Y ∈p. Since θ is an
involution, we have the Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra:
g = k ⊕p.
In this and future formulae about the Lie algebra, ⊕means “vector space
direct sum”. All Cartan involutions are conjugate in the group of Lie algebra
automorphisms of g, which is a ﬁnite extension of the group generated by
{exp ad X : X ∈g}. The Cartan involution θ extends to an automorphism Θ
of the group G, whose ﬁxed point set is a maximal compact subgroup K of G.
Next choose a maximal subalgebra of p; this is abelian, and is denoted by a.
All such subalgebras are conjugate under K. Let ad(X) denote the derivation
Y →[X, Y ] of g. Then the Killing form B, given by
B(X, Y ) = tr(ad(X) ad(Y ))
∀X, Y ∈g,
gives rise to an inner product on a:
(X, Y )B = −B(X, θY )
∀X, Y ∈g,
which gives rise to a dual inner product, denoted in the same way, on a∗,
which in turn extends to a bilinear form on aC, also denoted in the same way.
The third step in the description and construction of the various special
subalgebras of g and corresponding subgroups of G is to decompose g as a
direct sum of root spaces gα and a subalgebra g0. Simultaneously diagonalise
the operators ad(H), for H in a. For α in the real dual a∗of a (that is,
a∗= HomR(a, R)), deﬁne
gα = {X ∈g : [H, X] = α(H)X
∀H ∈a}.

For most α in a∗, gα = {0}, but when α = 0, then a ⊆g0, so g0 ̸= {0}. There
are ﬁnitely many nonzero α in a∗for which gα ̸= {0}; these α are called the
real roots of (g, a), and the set thereof is written Σ. This set is a root system,
a highly symmetric subset of a∗. Because g0 is θ-stable,
g0 = (g0 ∩k) ⊕(g0 ∩p) = m ⊕a,
say, where m is the subalgebra of k of elements which commute with a. Using
the fact that ad(H) is a derivation of g for each H in a, it is easy to check
that
(1.1)
[gα, gβ] ⊆gα+β.
In particular, g0 is a subalgebra, and gα and gβ commute when gα+β = {0}.
Clearly
g = g0 ⊕
⊕

α∈Σ
gα.
Now order the roots. The hyperplanes {H ∈a : α(H) = 0}, for α in Σ,
divide a into ﬁnitely many connected open cones, known as Weyl chambers.
Pick one of these (arbitrarily) and ﬁx it; it is called the positive Weyl chamber,
and written a+. A root α is now said to be positive or negative as α(H) > 0
or α(H) < 0 for all H in a+. Write Σ+ for the set of positive roots; then
Σ = Σ+ ∪−(Σ+). For some roots α and real numbers t, tα is also a root; the
possibilities are that t = ±1 (this always happens), t = ±1/2 or t = ±2 (these
last four possibilities may or may not occur). If (1/2)α is not a root, then α
is said to be indivisible; denote by Σ+
0 the set of indivisible positive roots.
We can now deﬁne some more important subalgebras: let
n =

α∈Σ+
gα
and
n =

α∈Σ+
g−α ;
it is easy to deduce from formula (1.1) that n and n are nilpotent subalgebras
of g. Deﬁne ρ by the formula
ρ(H) = 1
2 tr(ad(H)|n)
∀H ∈a;
then ρ = (1/2) 
α∈Σ+ dim(gα) α. We now have the ingredients for two more
decompositions of g: the Iwasawa decomposition and the Bruhat decomposi-
tion, written
g = k ⊕a ⊕n
and
g = n ⊕m ⊕a ⊕n.
The proof of the second (Bruhat) decomposition is immediate. For the ﬁrst
(Iwasawa) decomposition, note that if X ∈gα, then θX ∈g−α, so that, if
X ∈n, then
X = (X + θX) −θX ∈k ⊕n.

1.2 Decompositions of Semisimple Lie Groups
At the group level, there are similar decompositions (usually known as factori-
sations in undergraduate linear algebra courses). Let K, A, N and N denote
the connected subgroups of G with Lie algebras k, a, n and n, and let A+ and
A
+ be the subsemigroup exp(a+) of A and its closure. Let M and M ′ be the
centraliser and normaliser of a in K. Then both M and M ′ have m as their
Lie algebra. The group M ′ is never connected, while M is connected in some
examples and is not in others. However, M ′/M is always ﬁnite. In fact, the
adjoint action Ad of M ′ on a induces an isomorphism of M ′/M with a ﬁnite
group of orthogonal transformations of a, generated by reﬂections. This is the
Weyl group, W(g, a). It acts simply transitively on the space of Weyl cham-
bers, that is, every Weyl chamber is the image of a+ under a unique element
of the Weyl group. By duality, this group also acts on a∗, and permutes the
roots amongst themselves. Take a representative sw in M ′ of each w in the
Weyl group.
At the group level, there are three important decompositions:
G = KA
+K,
(1.2)
G = KAN,
(1.3)
G =

w∈W
MANswMAN
(1.4)
(this last formula involves a disjoint union). The Cartan decomposition (1.2)
arises from the “polar decomposition” G = K exp(p), in which the map
(k, X) →k exp(X) is a diﬀeomorphism from K × p onto G; every element
of p is conjugate to an element of a+ by an element of K. In the Iwasawa de-
composition (1.3), the map (k, a, n) →kan is a diﬀeomorphism from K×A×N
onto G. In the Bruhat decomposition (1.4), each of the sets MANswMAN
is a submanifold of G, and the |W| submanifolds are pairwise disjoint. There
is a unique longest element w of the Weyl group, which maps a+ to −a+;
the corresponding submanifold of G is open and its complement is a union of
submanifolds of lower dimension. More precisely,
G =

w∈W
swMANswMAN
=

w∈W
swsws−1
w NAMswMAN
=

w∈W
swwN wMAN,
where N w = s−1
w NSw∩N; each N w is a Lie subgroup of N, of lower dimension
unless w = w, and the map (n, m, a, n) →nman is a diﬀeomorphism from
N w × M × A × N onto N wMAN.

Applications of Representation Theory to Harmonic Analysis

For many purposes it is suﬃcient to think of the Bruhat decomposition
in the following way: the map (n, m, a, n) →nMAN of N × M × A × N
to G is a diﬀeomorphism of NMAN onto an open dense subset of G whose
complement is a ﬁnite union of lower dimensional submanifolds. In particular,
N MAN is of full measure in G/MAN, equipped with any of the natural
measures. I will use the abusive notation G ≃N MAN to indicate this sort
of “quasi-decomposition”.
There are integral formulae associated with these group decompositions.
In particular, we will use the formula
(1.5)

G
u(x) dx = C

K

a+

K
u(k1 exp(H)k2)

α∈Σ
sinh(α(H))dim(gα) dk1 dH dk2,
which relates the Haar measure on G with the Haar measure dk on K and
a weighted variant of Lebesgue measure dH on a+. For the formulae for the
Iwasawa and Bruhat decompositions, see [60, Propositions I.5.1 and I.5.21].
1.3 Parabolic Subgroups
The subgroup MAN, often written P, is known as a minimal parabolic sub-
group. Any subgroup P1 of G containing MAN is known as a parabolic sub-
group; such a group may be decomposed in the form
P1 = M1A1N1,
where M1 ⊇M, A1 ⊆A, and N1 ⊆N. The group M1 is a semisimple
subgroup of G, and has its own Iwasawa and Bruhat decompositions:
M1 = K1A1N 1
and
M1 ≃N
1M 1A1N 1.
In these formulae, K1 ⊆K, A1 ⊆A, N 1 ⊆N, M 1 ⊇M, and N
1 ⊆N;
moreover, N
1 = ΘN 1. If a1, a1, n1 and n1 denote the subalgebras of a and
n corresponding to A1, A1, N1 and N 1, then a = a1 ⊕a1 and n = n1 ⊕n1.
To each parabolic subgroup P1, we associate ρ1 on a1, deﬁned similarly to ρ;
more precisely,
ρ1(H) = 1
2 tr(ad(H)|n1)
∀H ∈a1
The point of this is mainly that the set of all subgroups P1 of G containing
P is well understood: it is a ﬁnite lattice with a well determined structure.
We conclude our discussion of the structure of G with one more deﬁni-
tion. A parabolic subgroup P1 of G is called cuspidal if M1 has a compact
Cartan subgroup, that is, if there is a compact abelian subgroup of K1 which
cannot be extended to a larger abelian subgroup of M1. Since M is compact,

6
M. Cowling
P is automatically cuspidal. It is a deep theorem of Harish-Chandra that
the semisimple groups which have discrete series representations, that is, ir-
reducible unitary representations which are subrepresentations of the regular
representation, are precisely those with compact Cartan subgroups.
1.4 Spaces of Homogeneous Functions on G
For this section, ﬁx a parabolic subgroup M1A1N1 of G. Take an irreducible
unitary representation µ of M1 and λ in the complexiﬁcation a∗
1C of a∗
1 (that
is, a∗
1C = HomR(a1, C)). Let Hµ denote the Hilbert space on which the rep-
resentation µ acts. Consider the vector space Vµ,λ of all smooth (inﬁnitely
diﬀerentiable) Hµ-valued functions ξ on G with the property that
ξ(xman) = e(iλ−ρ1)(log a)µ(m)−1ξ(x),
for all x in G, all m in M1, all a in A1 and all n in N1. These functions may
also be viewed as functions on G/N1, since ξ(xn) = ξ(x) for all x in G and
n in N1, or as sections of a vector bundle over G/P1. I shall take the naive
viewpoint that they are functions on G, even though there are often good
geometric reasons for using vector bundle terminology. Write πµ,λ for the left
translation representation on Vµ,λ:
[πµ,λ(y)ξ](x) = ξ(y−1x)
∀x, y ∈G.
The inner product on Hµ induces a pairing Vµ,λ′×Vµ,λ →V1,λ′−λ+iρ1: indeed,
⟨ξ(xman), η(xman)⟩
= ⟨e(iλ′−ρ1)(log a)µ(m)−1ξ(x), e(iλ−ρ1)(log a)µ(m)−1η(x)⟩
= e(iλ′−iλ−2ρ1)(log a)⟨ξ(x), η(x)⟩,
so the complex-valued function x →⟨ξ(x), η(x)⟩indeed satisﬁes the covariance
condition characterising V1,λ′−λ+iρ1.
Lemma 1.1. There is a G-invariant positive linear functional IP1 on V1,iρ1,
which is unique up to a constant. It may be deﬁned as (a constant multiple
of) the Haar measure on K,
ξ →

K
ξ(k) dk,
or as (a constant multiple of) the Haar measure on N 1,
ξ →

N 1

Proof. This can be proved by fairly explicit means, involving calculation of
Jacobians, to show that there is a constant c such that

K
ξ(k) dk = c

N
ξ(n) dn,
and then deducing that this expression is K-invariant and N-invariant, and
so invariant under the group generated by K and N, which is G itself.
Alternatively, this may be proved by using the fact that the “modular
function” of M1A1N1 is given by man →e−2ρ1(log a). See, for instance, [71,
pp. 137–141].
Normalise IP1 so that
IP1(ξ) =

K
ξ(k) dk.
An immediate corollary of this lemma is that the spaces Vµ,λ and Vµ,λ are
in duality: the map
⟨ξ, η⟩→IP1⟨ξ(·), η(·)⟩
is well deﬁned. Further, it is easy to check that
⟨πµ,λ(y)ξ, πµ,λ(y)η⟩= ⟨ξ, η⟩
∀y ∈G.
In particular, if λ is real, then the duality on Vµ,λ × Vµ,λ gives an inner
product on Vµ,λ relative to which πµ,λ acts unitarily. In this case, Vµ,λ may
be completed to obtain a Hilbert space Hµ,λ on which πµ,λ acts unitarily.
In some cases, when λ is not real, it is possible to ﬁnd an inner product
on Vµ,λ relative to which πµ,λ acts unitarily. The unitary representations
which arise by completing Vµ,λ relative to this inner product are known as
complementary series representations. It is also possible to work with other
completions of Vµ,λ. For example, if 1 ≤p ≤∞, and Im(λ) = (2/p −1)ρ1,
then
∥ξ(xman)∥p
Hµ =
µ(m)e(iλ−ρ1)(log a)ξ(x)

p
Hµ
= e−p(Im λ+ρ1)(log a) ∥ξ(x)∥p
Hµ
= e−2ρ1(log a) ∥ξ(x)∥p
Hµ
for all x in G, all m in M, all a in A and all n in N, so ∥ξ(·)∥p
Hµ ∈V1,iρ1.
In this case, πµ,λ acts isometrically on the completion of Vµ,λ in the Lp-
norm

IP1(∥·∥p
Hµ)
	1/p, and to all intents and purposes we are dealing with a
representation on a Hµ-valued Lp-space.
It is a notable fact that for the case where G = SO(1, n), the represen-
tations πµ,λ may be completed to obtain unitary representations in Sobolev

spaces, as well as isometric representations on Lp-spaces, and the Sobolev
spaces and the Lp-spaces are linked as in the Sobolev embedding theorem:
the degree of diﬀerentiation involved is such that the Sobolev space is ei-
ther included in the Lp-space (when p > 2) or the Lp-space is included in the
Sobolev space (when p < 2). To understand the corresponding result for other
families of semisimple Lie groups, such as SU(1, n), is an important problem,
to be discussed in the last lecture.
It is known that the representations πµ,λ on Vµ,λ are mostly irreducible—
for a given µ, the set of λ in a∗
1C for which πµ,λ is reducible is a countable
union of hyperplanes in a∗
1C. Here, reducible means that there are nontrivial
closed (in the C∞-topology) G-invariant subspaces of Vµ,λ.
1.5 The Plancherel Formula
The Plancherel formula for semisimple Lie groups was proved by Harish-
Chandra [53, 54, 55], following previous work by various people for various
special cases. The representations involved are the representations πµ,λ, where
µ is a discrete series representation of M1 (written µ ∈
M1d), and λ in a∗
1C
is real. Such representations are sometimes called unitary principal series
representations—in this nomenclature, the principal series is the collection
of all the πµ,λ without the restriction on λ. Other authors call the smaller
collection of representations the unitary principal series, and the larger col-
lections of representations is then known as the analytic continuation of the
principal series. All the cuspidal parabolic subgroups are involved.
A bit more notation is needed to state the Plancherel theorem: for u in
C∞
c (G), the operator πµ,λ(u) is given by the formula
πµ,λ(u) =

G
u(y) πµ,λ(y) dy,
which is to be interpreted as an operator-valued integral. Let P be a set of
nonconjugate cuspidal parabolic subgroups of G, and c be the more or less
explicitly determined function known as the Harish-Chandra c-function.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose that u ∈C∞
c (G). Then the operators πµ,λ(u) are
trace-class for all µ in 
M1d and λ in a∗
1C, and the L2(G)-norm of u is given
by
∥u∥2


πµ,λ(u)∗πµ,λ(u)
	
|c(P1, µ, λ)|−2 dλ.
Fortunately, a simpler formula is available for most of the analysis in the
following lectures. If the function u is K-invariant, on the left or the right or
both, then πµ,λ(u) = 0 unless P1 is the minimal parabolic and µ is the trivial
representation 1 of M. This reduces substantially the number of terms in the
Plancherel formula. Further, the operators π1,λ(u) are rank one operators, so

that the Hilbert–Schmidt norm and the operator norm ||| · ||| (and all the other
Schatten p-norms) coincide. Thus
∥u∥2
2 = cG

a∗|||πµ,λ(u)|||
2 |c(λ)|−2 dλ.
Let 1λ denote the function in V1,λ which is identically equal to 1 on K.
When u is K-bi-invariant, the formula simpliﬁes further: π1,λ(u) is a multiple
of the projection onto C1λ. This multiple, denoted u(λ), is given by
u(λ) =

G
u(x) ϕλ(x) dx
where
ϕλ(x) = ⟨π1,λ(x)1λ, 1λ⟩
∀x ∈G.
For K-bi-invariant functions u, the Plancherel formula becomes

the corresponding inversion formula is
(1.7)
u(x) = cG

a∗u(λ) ϕλ(x) |c(λ)|−2 dλ
∀x ∈G.
There are a number of integral formulae for ϕλ, which may be found in [60,
Chapter IV]. One of these is the following: for any x in G, denote by A(x)
the unique element of a such that x ∈N exp A(x) K. For any λ in a∗
C, the
spherical function ϕλ is given by
ϕλ(x) =

K
exp

(iλ + ρ)(A(kx))
	
dk
∀x ∈G.
It is worth pointing out that when G is complex, then there are explicit
formulae for ϕλ, in terms of elementary functions, and for several other cases
where dim(a) is small, there are formulae in terms of hypergeometric functions
or other less elementary functions (see, for instance, [64]). Perhaps the most
important technique for understanding spherical functions in a fairly general
context is M. Flensted-Jensen’s method [48] of reducing the case of a normal
real form to the complex case. It is possible to work with spherical functions
fairly eﬀectively: one can formulate conjectures using the complex case as a
guide, and prove many of these for some or all general semisimple groups.

2 The Equations of Mathematical Physics on Symmetric
Spaces
Let G be a semisimple Lie group with a maximal compact subgroup K; then
the quotient space X = G/K is, in a natural way, a negatively curved Rie-
mannian manifold. In particular, when G = SO(1, n), SU(1, n), or Sp(1, n),
the manifold X is a real, complex, or quaternionic hyperbolic space. The
Laplace–Beltrami operator on X is a natural second order elliptic diﬀerential
operator. I prefer to deal with the positive operator ∆, equal to minus the
Laplace–Beltrami operator. The L2 spectrum of ∆is the interval [b, ∞), where
b = (ρ, ρ)B. It is natural to study not only ∆, but also ∆−b, which is still a
positive operator and from some geometric points of view is more canonical
than ∆. We shall consider ∆−θb, where θ ∈[0, 1].
This lecture deals with the equations of mathematical physics on X, that
is, with the solutions of the equations
∂
∂tu1(x, t) + (∆−θb)u1(x, t) = 0
∂2
∂t2 u2(x, t) −(∆−θb)u2(x, t) = 0
∂2
∂t2 u3(x, t) + (∆−θb)u3(x, t) = 0
∂
∂tu4(x, t) + i(∆−θb)u4(x, t) = 0
for all (x, t) in X × R+, with boundary conditions uk(·, 0) = f for all k
in {1, 2, 3, 4}, u2(·, t) →0 (in some sense, depending on f) as t →∞, and
∂u3/∂t(·, 0) = i(∆−θb)1/2f. These equations are the heat equation, Laplace’s
equation, the wave equation, and the Schr¨odinger equation. In the Euclidean
case, these equations can be solved using the Fourier transform. The same is
true in this case.
2.1 Spherical Analysis on Symmetric Spaces
Any function f on X gives rise canonically to a K-right-invariant function
on G, also denoted by f. The key to the Fourier transform approach to these
equations is that, for any f in C∞
c (X),
π1,λ(∆f) = ((λ, λ)B + (ρ, ρ)B)π1,λ(f)
∀λ ∈a∗
C,
that is, ∆is a Fourier multiplier. Because ∆corresponds to a positive oper-
ator on L2(X), it is possible to use spectral theory to deﬁne m(∆) for Borel
measurable functions on [b, ∞). For bounded m, the operator m(∆) is deﬁned
by
m(∆)f =
 ∞
b
m(ζ) dPζf
∀f ∈L2(X),

where {Pζ} is the spectral resolution of the identity such that
∆f =
 ∞
b
ζ dPζf
∀f ∈Dom(∆).
Deﬁne the quadratic function Qθ by the formula
Qθ(λ) = (λ, λ)B + (1 −θ)(ρ, ρ)B
∀λ ∈a∗
C.
By spectral theory,
π1,λ((∆−θb)f) = Qθ(λ) π1,λ(f)
and
π1,λ(m(∆−θb)f) = m(Qθ(λ)) π1,λ(f).
At least formally, the solutions of the equations of mathematical physics on
L2(X) are given by
u1(·, t) = e−t(∆−θb)f
u2(·, t) = e−t(∆−θb)1/2f
u3(·, t) = eit(∆−θb)1/2f
u4(·, t) = eit(∆−θb)f
for all t in R+. These solutions may also be expressed in terms of convolutions
with kernels:
u1(xK, t) = Ht,θf(xK) = f ⋆ht,θ(x)
u2(xK, t) = Lt,θf(xK) = f ⋆lt,θ(x)
u3(xK, t) = Wt,θf(xK) = f ⋆wt,θ(x)
u4(xK, t) = St,θf(xK) = f ⋆st,θ(x),
for all x in G and t in R+; here, at least formally, the kernels are the K-bi-
invariant objects on G such that
ht,θ = e−tQθ
lt,θ = e−tQ1/2
θ
wt,θ = eitQ1/2
θ
st,θ = eitQθ.
These formulae should be compared with the results in the Euclidean case
obtained by classical Fourier analysis. For example, for the heat equation
in Rn,

12
M. Cowling
u(x, t) = f ⋆gt
Fu(ξ, t) = (Ff)(ξ) e−t|ξ|2
for all x and ξ in Rn and t in R+, where gt is the appropriately normalised
Gaussian kernel on Rn and F denotes the spatial Fourier transform.
In order to obtain useful information from these formulae for the solutions
to these equations, we need to have information about the kernels ht,θ, lt,θ,
wt,θ, and st,θ. This information can be of several types, for instance, point-
wise estimates, Lp estimates, or parametrix expressions (the latter means an
expression of the kernel as a sum of distributions). It is also important to
understand the regularity properties of ∆itself.
2.2 Harmonic Analysis on Semisimple Groups and Symmetric
Spaces
This section outlines some of the features of harmonic analysis on noncom-
pact semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces. In particular, we describe
the spherical Fourier transformation, and the Plancherel measure and the c-
function. We also prove a Hausdorﬀ–Young type theorem about the Fourier
transform of an Lp(G)-function for p in (1, 2), and a partial converse.
We ﬁrst discuss the spherical Fourier transform of an L1(G)-function. Let
W1 be the interior of the convex hull in a∗of the images of ρ under the Weyl
group W of (g, a). For δ in (0, 1), denote by Wδ and Tδ the dilate of W1 by
δ and the tube over the polygon Wδ, that is, Tδ = a∗+ iδ W1; Wδ and Tδ
denote the closures of these sets in a∗and a∗
C respectively.
If λ = λ0 −iρ, where λ0 lies in a∗, then the formula (1.2) deﬁning the
spherical function ϕλ becomes
ϕλ(x) =

K
exp

iλ0(A(kx))
	
dk
∀x ∈G,
which implies immediately that ϕλ is bounded. The spherical functions are
invariant under the Weyl group action on a∗
C, that is, ϕλ = ϕwλ for all w in W.
Hence ϕλ is bounded whenever λ lies in a∗−iwρ, for any w in W, and now a
straightforward interpolation argument implies that ϕλ is bounded whenever
λ lies in T1. A full proof of this is in Helgason [60, IV.8].
Further, the map λ →ϕλ from a∗
C to C(G), endowed with the topology
of uniform convergence on compact sets, is holomorphic and so, in particular,
continuous. It follows that if f is in L1(G), then f extends to a continuous
function in T1, holomorphic in T1. If f is a distribution on G which convolves
L1(G) into itself, then f is a bounded measure on G, and similarly, f also
extends continuously to T1, and holomorphically to T1.
We now discuss the Plancherel formula. Recall (1.6): for K-bi-invariant
functions u,

∀λ ∈a∗,
where each “Plancherel factor” |cα(·)|−2, which is given by an explicit formula

hood of the real axis and satisﬁes
(2.1)
|cα(z)|−2 ∼|z|2 (1 + |z|)dα−2
∀z ∈R,
where dα = dim(gα) + dim(g2α). This and other useful results about the
c-function may be found in Helgason’s book [60, IV.6]. It follows easily that
there exists a positive constant C such that
|c(λ)|−2 ≤C |λ|ν−ℓ(1 + |λ|)n−ν
∀λ ∈a∗.
We shall use a modiﬁed version µ of the Plancherel measure as well as an
auxiliary function Υ on a∗deﬁned by the rule
dµ(λ)/dλ = Υ(λ) =


∀f ∈L2(K\X).
The modiﬁed Plancherel measure is invariant under the action of the Weyl
group W (like the Plancherel measure), and moreover it is quasi-invariant
under translations, in the sense that for any measurable subset S of a∗,
µ(S + λ) ≤Υ(λ) µ(S)
∀λ ∈a∗.
We now describe a version of the Hausdorﬀ–Young inequality valid for
semisimple Lie groups. Write δ(p) for 2/p −1.
Theorem 2.1. Equip a∗with the modiﬁed Plancherel measure µ. Suppose that
1 < p < 2, and that f lies in Lp(G). Then f may be extended to a measurable
function on the tube Tδ(p), holomorphic in Tδ(p), such that λ0 →f(· + iλ0)
is continuous from Wδ(p) to Lp′(a∗), and such that

Further, for any closed subtube T of Tδ(p), there exists a constant C such that
 f(λ)
 ≤C Υ(λ)−1/p′ ∥f∥p
∀f ∈Lp(G)
∀λ ∈T.

14
M. Cowling
Proof. See [36].
It follows from this that if 1 < p < 2 and λ is in Tδ(p), then ϕλ is in Lp′(G),
and for every closed subtube T of Tδ(p), there exists a constant C such that
∥ϕλ∥p′ ≤CΥ(λ)−1/p′. This is a little sharper than the standard result, that
∥ϕλ∥p′ ≤C, which is based on the pointwise inequality |ϕλ1+iλ2| ≤ϕiλ2,
trivially true when λ1 and λ2 lie in a∗.
Using only the fact that the spherical functions ϕλ are in Lp′(G) when λ is
in Tδ(p) and 1 ≤p < 2 (which may be proved by interpolation, as above, or by
careful estimates on the spherical functions), J.-L. Clerc and E.M. Stein [23,
Theorem 1] showed that if 1 ≤p < 2, then the spherical Fourier transform of
an Lp-function extends to a holomorphic function in Tδ(p), bounded in closed
subtubes thereof, and that if f convolves Lp(G) into itself, then its spherical
Fourier transform extends to a bounded holomorphic function in Tδ(p).
Another consequence of Theorem 2.1 is the K-bi-invariant version of the
Kunze–Stein phenomenon: if 1 ≤p < 2 and k is in Lp(K\X), then the maps
f →f ∗k and f →k ∗f are bounded on L2(G). Indeed, without loss of gen-
erality we may assume that k ≥0, and then Herz’ principe de majoration [63]
shows that it suﬃces to have k(0) bounded. Some of our computations require
this result, and others the stronger result that the maps f →f∗k and f →k∗f
are bounded on L2(G), if k is in Lp(G). This stronger result is known as the
Kunze–Stein phenomenon. The Kunze–Stein phenomenon (which is discussed
in more detail in Section 3.3) and the generalisation of Young’s inequality to
locally compact groups have the following consequences.
Theorem 2.2. Suppose that 1 ≤r ≤∞. For a function k in Lr(G), denote
by K and K′ the operators f →k ∗f and f →f ∗k from S(G) to C(G). Then
K and K′ are bounded from Lp(G) to Lq(G), with a corresponding operator
norm inequality, provided that one of the following conditions holds:
(i) if r = 1, and 1 ≤p = q ≤∞;
(ii) if 1 < r ≤2, q ≥r, p ≤r′, 0 ≤1/p −1/q ≤1/r′, and (p, q) ̸= (r, r) or
(r′, r′);
(iii) if 2 < r < ∞, q ≥r, p ≤r′, 0 ≤1/p −1/q ≤1/r′, and (p, q) ̸= (r, r′);
(iv) if r = ∞, p = 1, and q = ∞.
Consequently, if k is in Lr(G) for all r in (2, ∞], K and K′ are bounded from
Lp(G) to Lq(G) when 1 ≤p < 2 < q ≤∞.
Proof. We give the details of this proof because it is short and indicative
of the diﬀerences between harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces and on
Euclidean spaces. Without loss of generality, we may restrict our attention
to the operator K, because G is unimodular, so the mapping f →ˇf, where
ˇf(x) = f(x−1) for all x in G, which has the property that (f ∗k)ˇ = ˇk∗ˇf, acts
isometrically on each of the spaces Ls(G). Thus K is bounded from Lp(G) to
Lq(G) if and only if K′ is.

For the cases where r = 1 and r = ∞, the result is standard. If 1 < r < 2,
then it suﬃces to prove that Lr(G) ∗Lp(G) ⊆Lr(G) when 1 ≤p < r and
Lr(G)∗Lp(G) ⊆Lp(G) when r < p ≤2. For then duality arguments establish
that Lr(G) ∗Lr′(G) ⊆Lp(G) when r′ < p ≤∞and Lr(G) ∗Lp(G) ⊆Lp(G)
when 2 ≤p < r′, and interpolation arguments establish the boundedness
in the set claimed. The ﬁrst inclusion follows by multilinear interpolation
between the inclusions L1(G) ∗L1(G) ⊆L1(G) and L2(G) ∗Ls(G) ⊆L2(G),
for any s in [1, 2). The second inclusion follows by multilinear interpolation
between the inclusions L1(G) ∗Ls(G) ⊆Ls(G) and Lt(G) ∗L2(G) ⊆L2(G),
for any s and t in [1, 2).
When r = 2, the result is easy: one ﬁrst reformulates the Kunze–Stein
phenomenon to show that L2(G) ∗L2(G) ⊆Ls(G) when 2 < s ≤∞, then
applies duality and interpolation.
When 2 < r < ∞, the result follows by multilinear interpolation between
the results when r = 2 and when r = ∞.
The ﬁnal consequence is proved by combining the results of (iii) and (iv).
We shall deal with functions which belong to Lr(G) for all r in (2, ∞];
the convolution properties thereof are described in the theorem just proved.
As a corollary of Theorem 2.1, we may establish a criterion for a function
on a∗to be the spherical Fourier transform of such a function. A technical
deﬁnition is necessary: for any small positive ϵ, let H∞(Tϵ) denote the space
of all bounded holomorphic functions in Tϵ, with the supremum norm; clearly
when δ < ϵ, H∞(Tϵ) may be injected into H∞(Tδ) by restricting H∞(Tϵ)
functions to Tδ. The inductive limit space 
ϵ>0 H∞(Tϵ) is denoted by A(a∗).
An element of the dual space of A(a∗) will be called, somewhat abusively, an
analytic functional on a∗.
Corollary 2.1. Suppose that T is an analytic functional on a∗. Then there
exists a K-bi-invariant function on G, k say, which belongs to Lr(G) for all
r in (2, ∞], such that

G
k(x) f(x) dx = T( f)
∀f ∈S(G).
If a∗is endowed with the Plancherel measure and if
T( f) =

a∗
f(λ) t(λ) |c(λ)|−2 dλ
∀f ∈S(G),
where t is Weyl group invariant and lies in L1(a∗) ∩L2(a∗), then k = t.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.1. Fix s in [1, 2). If f
is in Ls(G) then f is in A(a∗), and so composition with T provides a linear
functional on Ls(G). Thus there exists k in Ls′(G) such that

G
k(x) f(x) dx = T( f)
∀f ∈Ls(G).

16
M. Cowling
Since this works for arbitrary s, k has the properties claimed. The second part
of the corollary follows from the Plancherel formula.
It is clear that if T is an analytic functional on a∗, then for any h belonging
to H∞(Tϵ) for some positive ϵ, hT, deﬁned by the rule hT(g) = T(hg) for all
g in A(a∗), is also an analytic functional on a∗.
Now we consider the question whether Theorem 2.1 has a converse: if f
extends to a holomorphic function in Tδ(p), is it necessarily true that f must
lie in Lp(G)? It is too much to expect that we will be able to prove the
converse in the semisimple case, when even in Euclidean Fourier analysis this
is impossible. However, we can prove a result which is useful.
To ﬁnd an estimate for ∥f∥p, it is tempting to try to interpolate between
estimates for ∥f∥1 and ∥f∥2. Unfortunately, the straightforward interpolation
argument gives
∥f∥p ≤∥f∥δ(p)
1
∥f∥1−δ(p)
2
,
which is useless unless f is holomorphic in T1, for otherwise f could not be
in L1(G). To obviate this problem, the obvious estimate is replaced by an
estimate
∥f∥p ≤∥fϕicρ∥δ(p)
1
∥fϕic′ρ∥1−δ(p)
2
,
where the spherical functions ϕicρ and ϕic′ρ are chosen so that the ﬁrst factor
lies in L1(G). A technique of L. Vretare [101] enables us to compute the second

2.3 Regularity of the Laplace–Beltrami Operator
The following result, taken from [36], but based on much previous work, encap-
sulates the various Sobolev-type regularity theorems for the Laplace–Beltrami
operator. In the following, we denote by n the dimension of X, by ℓits real
rank, that is, the (real) dimension of A, and by ν the pseudo-dimension or

Σ+

 is the cardinality of the set of the
indivisible positive roots. The pseudo-dimension ν may very well be strictly
larger than the dimension n, as, for instance, in the case of SL(p, R).
If 1 ≤p, q ≤∞, we denote by |||T|||p;q the norm of the linear operator T
from Lp(X) to Lq(X). In the case where p = q we shall simply write |||T|||p. By
C we denote a constant which may not be the same at diﬀerent occurrences.
The expression
A(t) ∼B(t)
∀t ∈D,
where D is some subset of the domains of A and of B, means that there exist
(positive) constants C and C′ such that
CA(t) ≤B(t) ≤C′A(t)
∀t ∈D;
C and C′ may depend on any quantiﬁers written before the displayed formula.

the set of all (p, q) satisfying the following conditions:
(i) if α = 0 then 1 ≤p = q ≤∞;
(ii) if Re α = 0 and Im α ̸= 0, then 1 < p = q < ∞;

2.4 Approaches to the Heat Equation
Quite a bit is known about the heat kernel ht,θ. For complex Lie groups,
an explicit expression is available [57]. For other Lie groups, less explicit but
nevertheless useful pointwise formulae are known. In particular, P. Sawyer [91,
92] estimated the heat kernels in a number of special cases. In the general
case, the best estimates are due to J.-Ph. Anker [3], Anker and L. Ji [4, 5],
and Anker and P. Ostellari [6]. Those who study these questions often speak of
having problems “at the walls”; this is, for example, the major problem with
the pointwise estimates for the spherical functions. To a large extent, these
problems are unimportant, since, for instance, it is possible to show that the
heat kernel is very small near the walls so that the precise behaviour there is
irrelevant. By the inversion theorem for the spherical Fourier transform (1.7),
ht,θ(x) = cG

a∗e−tQθ(λ)ϕλ(x) |c(λ)|−2 dλ.
To estimate ht,θ, one needs to know about the functions ϕλ. By the Cartan
decomposition (1.2), it suﬃces to consider x in A. The “diﬃculties at the
walls” are two-fold: for H in a, ϕλ(exp H) is hard to handle when λ is close
to a wall of a Weyl chamber in a∗or when H is close to a wall of a Weyl
chamber in a. Even in the complex case, obtaining estimates “close to the
walls” is tricky, especially if one wants estimates which are uniform in both
λ and H. Some progress on this problem has been made recently by Cowling
and A. Nevo [42], based on an idea of H. Gunawan [52].
The other approach to the problem is to try to obtain other sorts of esti-
mates for the kernels. For the heat equation, this has been quite eﬀective. In
the next section, we summarise some of the results of [36, 37], and extend one
of these a little.
2.5 Estimates for the Heat and Laplace Equations
Putting together the facts of the previous section, it is relatively easy to obtain
estimates for the operators arising in the heat and Laplace equations.
Theorem 2.5. Let (Ht)t>0 be the heat semigroup. Then the following hold:
(i) for all p in [1, ∞],
|||Ht|||p = exp

−(1 −δ(p)2)bt
	
∀t ∈R+;

(ii) for all p, q such that 1 ≤p ≤q ≤∞,
|||Ht|||p;q ∼t−n(1/p−1/q)/2
∀t ∈(0, 1];
(iii) for all p, q such that either 1 ≤p < q = 2 or 2 = p < q ≤∞,
|||Ht|||p;q ∼t−ν/4 exp(−bt)
∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(iv) for all p, q such that 1 ≤p < 2 < q ≤∞,
|||Ht|||p;q ∼t−ν/2 exp(−bt)
∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(v) for all p, q such that 1 ≤p < q < 2,
|||Ht|||p;q ∼t−ℓ/2q′ exp



∀t ∈[1, ∞).
Theorem 2.6. Suppose that 0 ≤θ ≤1 and 1 ≤p, q ≤∞. The following hold:
(i) if t > 0, then Lt,θ is bounded from Lp(X) to Lq(X) only if p ≤q, p ≤p′
θ,
and q ≥pθ;
(ii) if pθ ≤p ≤p′
θ, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;p = exp

∀t ∈R+;
(iii) if p ≤q, p ≤p′

|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−n(1/p−1/q)
∀t ∈(0, 1];
(iv) if p < q = 2 or 2 = p < q, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−ν/4 exp

−[(1 −θ)b]1/2t
	
∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(v) if p < 2 < q, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−ν/2 exp

−[(1 −θ)b]1/2t

(vi) if p < q < 2 and q > pθ, then



∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(vii) if p < q < 2 and q > pθ, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−ℓ/2q′ exp

−[( 4

∀t ∈[1, ∞);

20
M. Cowling
(viii) if p < q = pθ, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−(ℓ+1)/q′
∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(ix) if 2 < p < q and p < p′
θ, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−ℓ/2p exp


∀t ∈[1, ∞);
(x) if p′
θ = p < q, then
|||Lt,θ|||p;q ∼t−(ℓ+1)/p
∀t ∈[1, ∞).
It is worth pointing out that the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the behaviour
of the solutions of the heat and Laplace equations is due to the fact that
the function exp(−tQθ(·)) extends to an entire function in a∗
C while the func-
tion exp(−tQθ(·)1/2) extends into a tube Tδ, where δ = (1 −θ)1/2, but into
no larger tube. This shows clearly that harmonic analysis on a noncompact
symmetric space involves phenomena with no Euclidean analogue.
2.6 Approaches to the Wave and Schr¨odinger Equations
Dealing with the wave equation is tricky. There is a method, due originally to
Hadamard, for obtaining a parametrix for the fundamental solutions, but for
large values of the time parameter this is not very easy to deal with except in
the complex case and a few other relatively simple special cases.
Despite this, considerable progress has been made, and there are many
important papers on this topic, starting, perhaps, with work of Helgason [61].
T. Branson, G. ´Olafsson, and H. Schlichtkrull, in various combinations (see
[13] and the references cited there), have studied the heat equation by analytic
methods, while O.A. Chalykh and A.P. Veselov [19] used algebraic methods.
S. Giulini, S. Meda and I [38] have given a parametrix expression for the
wave operator and used this to obtain Lp-Lq mapping estimates for the com-
plexiﬁed Poisson semigroup, and we have also [39] obtained Lp-Lq estimates
for the operator with convolution kernel wα
θ , deﬁned by the condition
wα
θ (λ) = Qθ(λ)−α/2 exp(iQθ(λ)1/2),
using a representation of this operator originating in T.P. Schonbek [94] in
the Euclidean case. There is interest in obtaining similar inequalities where
the exponential is replaced by exp(itQθ(λ)1/2), and t is allowed to vary. Such
inequalities, which belong to the family known as Strichartz estimates, are
now a standard tool in hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations.
Last but not least, let us consider the Schr¨odinger operator. Here, not very
much is known except in the usual special cases (complex groups and real rank
one groups). Note, however, that the spherical Fourier transform st,θ extends

Applications of Representation Theory to Harmonic Analysis
21
to an entire function, but this grows exponentially in any tube Tδ when δ > 0;
this suggests that, as far as restrictions on the indices are concerned, the
results should resemble those for the heat equation case more than those for
Laplace’s equation. Note also that the rapid oscillation of st,θ(λ) as λ →∞
in a∗implies that st,θ(λ) deﬁnes an analytic functional, so that the kernel is
in L2+ϵ(G) for all positive ϵ. In a “discrete symmetric space” (see later for
an indication of what this might mean), some results have been obtained by
A.G. Setti [95].
2.7 Further Results
Much more is known about harmonic analysis on semisimple groups than
is outlined here. In the area of spherical Fourier analysis, it is more than
appropriate to mention the book of R. Gangolli and V.S. Varadarajan [50],
which presents a complete picture of the Harish-Chandra viewpoint. Much of
the theory of spherical functions may be viewed as statements about certain
special functions, and generalised. T. Koornwinder [72] presents a pleasant
account of this interface between group theory and special functions. As men-
tioned above, in the complex case, there are explicit formulae for the spherical
functions. For some other groups, there are ways of getting some control of
the spherical functions.
For the purposes of harmonic analysis, there are a number of important
characterisations of the image under the spherical Fourier transformation of
spaces on the semisimple group G. In particular, there is a family of “Schwartz
spaces” on G, whose images were characterised by various authors, as well as a
Paley–Wiener theorem characterising the compactly supported functions. The
original Paley–Wiener results are due to Helgason [58] and Gangolli [49], and
the Schwartz space results are due to P.C. Trombi and V.S. Varadarajan [100].
The proofs have been simpliﬁed since then. See [2, 24, 60] for more in this
direction.
A lot of eﬀort has been put into determining conditions on a distribution or
on its Fourier transform which imply that it convolves Lp(G) into itself. The
major contributions here include [1, 77, 78, 96]. In the more general setting
of a Riemannian manifold, there are many results on the functional calculus
for the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Arguably, the key technique here has been
the use of the ﬁnite propagation speed of the solutions to the heat equation,
pioneered by J. Cheeger, M. Gromov, and especially M.E. Taylor [20, 99].

3 The Vanishing of Matrix Coeﬃcients
Semisimple groups diﬀer from other locally compact groups in the sense that
their unitary representations may be characterised by the rate of decay of
their matrix coeﬃcients. In this lecture, I make this statement more precise,
describing diﬀerent ways in which this decay can be quantiﬁed.
3.1 Some Examples in Representation Theory
Suppose that G is a Lie group. A unitary representation (π, Hπ) of G is a
Hilbert space Hπ and a homomorphism π from G into U(Hπ), the group of
unitary operators on Hπ. We always suppose that π is continuous when U(Hπ)
is equipped with the strong operator topology. We usually abuse notation a
little and talk of “the representation π”, the Hilbert space being implicit.
Recall that the representation π is said to be reducible if there are non-
trivial G-invariant closed subspaces of Hπ, and irreducible otherwise. A vector
ξ in Hπ is said to be smooth if the Hπ-valued function x →π(x)ξ on G is
smooth, or equivalently if all the C-valued functions x →⟨π(x)ξ, η⟩(where η
varies over Hπ) are smooth. Similar deﬁnitions may be made when the Hilbert
space Hπ is replaced by a Banach space.
For unitary representations, as distinct from Banach space representation,
there is a reasonably satisfactory theory of decompositions into irreducible
representations. An arbitrary unitary representation can be written as a direct
integral (a generalisation of a direct sum) of irreducible representations. Many
Lie groups, including semisimple Lie groups and real algebraic groups (groups
of matrices deﬁned by algebraic equation in the entries), have the property
that this direct integral decomposition is essentially unique. On the other
hand, many groups, such as noncommutative free groups, do not have unique
direct integral decompositions; this makes analysis on these groups harder.
To give an indication of the sorts of decomposition which appear for “good”
groups, we give two examples.
For the group Rn, the irreducible representations are the characters
χy : x →exp(−2πiy · x), where y varies over Rn. Given a positive Borel
measure ν on Rn with support Sν, form the usual Hilbert space L2(Sν, ν) of
complex-valued functions on Sν, and deﬁne the representation πν on L2(Sν, ν)
by the formula
[πν(x)ξ](y) = χy(x) ξ(y)
∀y ∈Sν
for all ξ in L2(Sν, ν) and all x in Rn. Any unitary representation of Rn is uni-
tarily equivalent to a direct sum of representations πν, with possibly diﬀerent
ν’s.
The ax + b group Q is deﬁned to be the group of all matrices Ma,b of the
form
Ma,b =

a


,

where a ∈R+ and b ∈R, equipped with the obvious topology.
The set N of matrices M1,b, with b in R, is a closed normal subgroup of
Q, and the quotient group Q/N is isomorphic to the multiplicative group R+.
By identifying x in R with the vector

x
1

in R2, we obtain an action of Q
on R, given by
Ma,b ◦x = a2x + ab
∀x ∈R
∀Ma,b ∈Q.
Using this action, we deﬁne the representation σ of Q on L2(R) by the formula
σ(Ma,b)ξ(x) = a−1ξ(M −1
a,b ◦x)
∀x ∈R.
Under the representation σ of Q, the Hilbert space L2(R) breaks up into two
irreducible subspaces, L2(R)+ and L2(R)−, containing those functions whose
Fourier transforms are supported in [0, +∞) and in (−∞, 0] respectively. The
restrictions of σ to these two subspaces are denoted σ+ and σ−. Any unitary
representation π of the group Q decomposes as a sum π1 ⊕π0, where π1 is
trivial on N and hence is essentially a representation of the quotient group
Q/N, and π0 is a direct sum of copies of the representations σ+ and σ−.
Unitary representations of semisimple groups have been described, albeit
incompletely and brieﬂy, in the ﬁrst lecture. Much more is known—see the
references there.
Associated to a unitary representation π of G, there are matrix coeﬃcients.
For ξ and η in H, x →⟨π(x)ξ, η⟩is a bounded continuous function on G,
written ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩. If ξ and η run over an orthogonal basis of Hπ, then we
obtain a matrix of functions corresponding to the representation of π(·) as
a matrix in this basis. Thus the collection of all matrix coeﬃcients contains
complete information about π; for many purposes, however, it is easier to
deal with spaces of functions on G rather than representations. As we may
decompose a unitary representation π of G, so we may decompose the matrix
coeﬃcients of π into sums of matrix coeﬃcients of “smaller” representations.
In the case of Rn, this decomposition writes a function on Rn as a sum or an
integral of characters—this is just Fourier analysis under a diﬀerent guise.
When G = Rn, the matrix coeﬃcients of the irreducible representations
of G are (multiples of) characters. These are constant in absolute value, and
in particular do not vanish at inﬁnity or belong to any Lp space with ﬁnite p.
However, the regular representation λ of G on L2(G) has matrix coeﬃcients
which decay at inﬁnity: if ξ, η ∈L2(G), then
⟨λ(x)ξ, η⟩=

G
λ(x)ξ(y) η(y) dy
=

Rn ξ(y −x) η(y) dy
∀x ∈Rn,
and ⟨λ(·)ξ, η⟩has compact support if ξ and η do, and is in C0(G) in general.
It is easy to show that, by choosing ξ and η appropriately, it is possible to
make ⟨λ(·)ξ, η⟩decay arbitrarily slowly.

24
M. Cowling
In the ax + b case, all the matrix coeﬃcients of a representation π1 which
is trivial on N are constant on cosets of N in Q, and do not vanish at inﬁnity,
no matter how π1 behaves on the quotient group Q/N. On the other hand, the
representations σ+ and σ−have the property that all their matrix coeﬃcients
vanish at inﬁnity; as in the Rn case, this decay may be arbitrarily slow.
3.2 Matrix Coeﬃcients of Representations of Semisimple Groups
All semisimple Lie groups are “almost direct products” of “simple factors”;
unitary representations break up as “outer tensor products” of representations
of the various factors, and the matrix coeﬃcients decompose similarly. There
is therefore little loss of generality in restricting attention to simple Lie groups,
that is, those whose Lie algebra is simple, for the rest of this lecture.
An important notion in the study of representations of a semisimple Lie
group is K-ﬁniteness. A vector ξ in Hπ is said to be K-ﬁnite if {π(k)ξ : k ∈K}
spans a ﬁnite dimensional subspace. The set of K-ﬁnite vectors is a dense
subspace of Hπ.
The ﬁrst key fact about a unitary representation π of a simple Lie group
G is that it decomposes into two pieces, π1 and π0. The representation π1 is
a multiple of the trivial representation, and the associated matrix coeﬃcients
are constants, while all the matrix coeﬃcients of π0 vanish at inﬁnity in G.
Several of the proofs of this involve looking at subgroups R of G similar to
the group Q described above, and “lifting” to G the decomposition from R.
The diﬃculty of the proof is in showing that G acts trivially on the vectors
where the normal subgroup N of R acts trivially.
The remarkable fact is that we can often say more than this: for most
representations of interest, there is control on the rate of decay. There are two
ways to quantify the rate of decay of matrix coeﬃcients: uniform estimates
and Lp+ estimates.
Recall, from Lecture 1, the Cartan decomposition: every x in G may be
written in the form
x = k1ak2,
where k1, k2 ∈K and a ∈A
+, the closure of exp(a+) in A. A uniform estimate
for a matrix coeﬃcient u is an estimate of the form
|u(k1ak2)| ≤C φ(a)
∀k1, k2 ∈K
∀a ∈A
+,
for some function φ in C0(A
+). An Lp+ estimate for u is the statement that,
for any positive ϵ, the function u is in Lp+ϵ(G), and ∥u∥p+ϵ, the Lp+ϵ(G)
norm of u, may be estimated. Matrix coeﬃcients of unitary representations
are always bounded, so that if u ∈Lp(G), then u ∈Lq(G) for all q in [p, ∞].
Thus the set of q such that u ∈Lq(G) is an interval containing ∞.
For irreducible representations of G, the K-ﬁnite matrix coeﬃcients are so-
lutions of diﬀerential equations on A. These are ℓ-dimensional generalisations

Applications of Representation Theory to Harmonic Analysis
25
of the hypergeometric diﬀerential equation, and an extension of the analysis
of diﬀerential equations with regular singular points to A leads to proofs of
the existence of asymptotic expressions for matrix coeﬃcients (ﬁrst carried
out by Harish-Chandra, but published in an improved and simpliﬁed version
by W. Casselman and D. Miliˇci´c [18]). In particular, it can be shown that, for
all K-ﬁnite matrix coeﬃcients of an irreducible unitary representation,
⟨π(exp(H))ξ, η⟩∼

γ∈I
C(ξ, η, γ)℘γ(H)e−(ρ+γ)(H)
as H →∞in a+, keeping away from the walls of a+, for some ﬁnite subset
I of a∗
C with the property that Re γ(H) ≥0 for all H in a+ and γ in I, and
some polynomials ℘γ of bounded degree; both the set I of “leading terms”
and the polynomials ℘γ are independent of ξ and η.
From this fact, it appears that the best sort of uniform estimate to consider
is one of the form
|u(k1 exp(H)k2)| ≤C ℘(H)e−γ(H)
∀k1, k2 ∈A
∀H ∈a+,
where γ ∈a+ and ℘is a polynomial. It can be shown that such estimates hold
for K-ﬁnite matrix coeﬃcients of irreducible representations.
Let us now formulate a conjecture.
Conjecture 3.1. Suppose that π is a unitary representation of a simple Lie
group G, that γ ∈a∗, and that 0 < γ(H) ≤ρ(H) for all H in a+. Then
|⟨π(k1 exp(H)k2)ξ, η⟩| ≤C(ξ, η) ℘π(H)e−γ(H)
∀k1, k2 ∈A
∀H ∈a+
if and only if a similar inequality, with the same γ, holds for each of the
irreducible representations involved in the decomposition of π.
Note that some of the representations involved in the decomposition of π
may admit uniform estimates with much more rapid decay rates. I know of
no proof of this conjecture in general, but it is certainly true in a few simple
cases.
By using Lp+ estimates, we may prove a version of Conjecture 3.1 for the
case where α = (1/m)ρ, for some positive integer m. To do this, we have to
ﬁnd a connection between uniform estimates and Lp+ estimates.
Suppose that 0 < t ≤1, that ℘is a positive polynomial on a+, and that
φ(exp(H)) = ℘(H)e−tρ(H)
∀H ∈a+.
If pt ≥2, and
|u(k1ak2)| ≤φ(a)
∀k1, k2 ∈K
∀a ∈A
+,
then u satisﬁes Lp+ estimates. Indeed, from (1.5),

More generally, if α ∈Tt, and
|u(k1 exp(H)k2)| ≤℘(H)e−α(H)
∀H ∈a+,
for some polynomial ℘, then u satisﬁes L2/t + estimates. This shows that
uniform estimates imply Lp+ estimates.
Conversely, good Lp+ estimates imply uniform estimates. More precisely,
if we know that ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈Lp+ϵ(G) for all positive ϵ and all K-ﬁnite smooth
vectors ξ and η in Hπ, then we argue that the function ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩and lots of
its derivatives lie in Lp+ϵ(G) for all positive ϵ; using an argument involving
the Sobolev embedding theorem and the exponential growth of G, we may
then show that
|⟨π(k1 exp(H)k2)ξ, η⟩| ≤C(ϵ, ξ, η)e−(2/p+ϵ)ρ(H)
∀k1, k2 ∈K
∀H ∈a+.
The details of this may be found in [30].
Observe that the uniform estimates are “nicer” than the Lp+ estimates
because they contain more information: decay can be faster in some directions
than others. However, they have the weakness that they are not translation-
invariant: if
|u(k1ak2)| ≤φ(a)
∀k1, k2 ∈K
∀a ∈A

On the other hand, spaces of matrix coeﬃcients are translation-invariant:
indeed
⟨π(·y)ξ, η⟩= ⟨π(·)(π(y)ξ), η⟩.

3.3 The Kunze–Stein Phenomenon
Possibly the most important decay estimate for matrix coeﬃcients of simple
(or semisimple) Lie groups is the Kunze–Stein phenomenon. This says that
L2+ estimates hold for the matrix coeﬃcients of the regular representation λ
of G on L2(G). More precisely, for all positive ϵ, there exists a constant Cϵ
such that, if ξ and η are in L2(G), then ⟨λ(·)ξ, η⟩∈L2+ϵ(G) and
∥⟨λ(·)ξ, η⟩∥2+ϵ ≤Cϵ ∥ξ∥2 ∥η∥2 .
This result was ﬁrst observed by R.A. Kunze and Stein for the case where
G = SL(2, R), then extended to a number of other simple Lie groups by
Kunze and Stein, and by others. Inspired by Kunze and Stein, C.S. Herz [63]
and then P. Eymard and N. Lohou´e [46] made inroads into the general case.
The ﬁrst general proof, which uses a simpliﬁed version of the argument of
Kunze and Stein, may be found in [29]. An important corollary of a little
functional analysis combined with the Kunze–Stein phenomenon is that, if π
is any representation of a simple Lie group G and, for some positive integer
m, ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈L2m+ϵ(G) for all positive ϵ and all ξ and η in a dense subspace
of Hπ, then ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈L2m+ϵ(G) for all positive ϵ and all ξ and η in Hπ;
further there exists a constant C(G, ϵ, m) such that
∥⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∥2m+ϵ ≤C(G, ϵ, m) ∥ξ∥∥η∥
∀ξ, η ∈Hπ.
The functional analysis serves to show that the m-fold tensor product π⊗m
of π is “weakly contained in the regular representation”; the Kunze–Stein
phenomenon then gives L2+ϵ/m estimates for ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩m. See [35] for more
details.
It may be conjectured that, if q ≥2 and ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈Lq+ϵ(G) for all
positive ϵ and all ξ and η in a dense subspace of Hπ, then ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈Lq+ϵ
for all ξ and η in H, and Lq+ estimates hold. This is certainly correct for the
cases when G = SO(1, n) or SU(1, n), but the proof for these groups does not
generalise. No such result can hold if q < 2: see [30] for the argument.
In any case, these ideas, together with the links between uniform estimates
and Lp+ estimates, establish the claim earlier that Conjecture 3.1 holds when
α = (1/m)ρ, for some positive integer m.
Recently, sharper versions of the Kunze–Stein phenomenon have been dis-
covered, at least for groups of real rank one. In particular, the Kunze–Stein
estimates are dual to the convolution estimate Lp(G) ∗L2(G) ⊆L2(G); by
interpolation with the obvious result L1(G) ∗L1(G) ⊆L1(G), this implies
that Lr(G) ∗Ls(G) ⊆Ls(G) when 1 ≤r < s ≤2. By using Lorentz spaces
Lp,q(G), it is possible to formulate versions of the Kunze–Stein convolution
theorem such as Lp,1(G) ∗Lp(G) ⊆Lp(G) for the case where p < 2 (see [32])
and L2,1(G) ∗L2,1(G) ⊆L2,∞(G) (see [66]). The study of related operators,
such as maximal operators, has also begun; the major result here is that of
J.-O. Str¨omberg [97].

3.4 Property T
Certain Lie groups (and many more locally compact groups) have property T.
This is a property with several equivalent formulations, one of which is that
the trivial representation is isolated in the unitary dual G of G, that is, the set
of all equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G, equipped
with a natural topology.
This property was introduced by D.A. Kazhdan [70] who proved that
SL(3, R), and many other simple Lie groups with dim(A) ≥2, have it. Shortly
after, S.P. Wang [103] observed that Kazhdan’s argument could be developed
to prove that all simple Lie groups with dim(A) ≥2 have property T. At about
the same times, B. Kostant [73, 74] established that Sp(1, n) and F4,−20 have
property T, while SO(1, n) and SU(1, n) do not. Since then property T has
appeared in a number of diﬀerent applications of representation theory, includ-
ing the proof (of J.M. Rosenblatt, D. Sullivan and G.A. Margulis [82, 88, 98])
that Lebesgue measure is the only ﬁnitely additive rotation-invariant position
additive set function on the sphere Sk, for k ≥5, and the construction by
Margulis [81, 83] of “expanders”, graphs with a very high degree of connectiv-
ity. The monograph of P. de la Harpe and A. Valette [56] presents a detailed
account of these applications, and much more; for more recent applications,
see also the monographs of P. Sarnak [89] and A. Lubotzky [79]. If G is a
simple Lie group with property T, then there exists pG in (2, ∞) such that
⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∈LpG+ϵ(G)
∀ξ, η ∈Hπ
for all unitary representations π of G with no trivial subrepresentations, and
further
∥⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩∥pG+ϵ ≤CG,ϵ ∥ξ∥∥η∥
∀ξ, η ∈Hπ.
In other words, there is uniform vanishing at inﬁnity of all matrix coeﬃcients
which vanish at inﬁnity. This can also be expressed with uniform estimates
for smooth K-ﬁnite matrix coeﬃcients.
Kazhdan’s proof that SL(3, R) has property T uses an argument like the
argument already given to show that matrix coeﬃcients decay at inﬁnity.
Indeed, SL(3, R) contains the subgroup Q1, of all elements of the form
⎡
⎣
a b x
c d y
0 0 1
⎤
⎦,
where a, b, c, d, x, y ∈R, and ad −bc = 1. The subgroups M1 and N1 of Q1
are deﬁned by the conditions that x = y = 0 (for M1) and a = d = 1 and
b = c = 0 (for N1).
Representation theory (“the Mackey machine”) shows that any unitary
representation π of Q1 splits into two: π = π1 ⊕π0, where π1 is trivial on
N1 and π0|M1 is a subrepresentation of the regular representation of M1. A

Applications of Representation Theory to Harmonic Analysis

representation whose matrix coeﬃcients vanish at inﬁnity cannot have a π1
component. Kazhdan used this analysis to deduce that π cannot approach 1.
In [30], it is shown that the matrix coeﬃcients of π, restricted to M1, satisfy
L2+ϵ estimates; this is then used to show that the matrix coeﬃcients satisfy
LpG+ estimates on G. Later, R.E. Howe [65], R. Scaramuzzi [93], J.-S. Li [75,
76] and H. Oh [85, 86] analysed the various possibilities more carefully, and
found optimal values for pG.
3.5 The Generalised Ramanujan–Selberg Property
Suppose that the simple Lie group G acts on a probability space Ω, preserving
the measure. Then there is a unitary representation π of G on L2(Ω) given
by the formula
[π(x)ξ](ω) = ξ(x−1ω)
∀ω ∈Ω
∀ξ ∈L2(Ω).
The constant functions form a 1-dimensional G-invariant subspace of L2(Ω);
denote by L2(Ω)0 its orthogonal complement. When G acts ergodically on Ω,
there is no invariant vector in L2(Ω)0 (this may be taken as the deﬁnition
of ergodicity). It follows that all the matrix coeﬃcients of the restriction π0
of π to L2(Ω)0 vanish at inﬁnity. If G has property T, then these matrix
coeﬃcients satisfy a LpG+ estimate. We deﬁne an action of G on a probability
space Ωto be a T-action if there is some ﬁnite q such that the restricted
representation π0 has matrix coeﬃcients which satisfy a Lq+ estimate. Then
every ergodic action of a group with property T is a T-action.
If the action of G on a probability space Ωis an T-action, then information
about the representation of G on Lp(Ω) comes from complex interpolation.
Indeed, suppose that p < 2, and that ξ ∈Lp(Ω)0 and η ∈Lp′(Ω)0, that is,
ξ ∈Lp(Ω), η ∈Lp′(Ω), and both have zero mean on Ω. For a complex number
z with Re(z) in [0, 1], deﬁne ξz and ηz:
ξz = |ξ|p(1−z/2)−1 ξ −

Ω
|ξ|p(1−z/2)−1 ξ
and
ηz = |η|p′z/2−1 η −

Ω
|η|p′z/2−1 η.
If Re(z) = 0, then
|ξ|p(1−z/2)−1 ξ
 = |ξ|p and
|η|p′z/2−1 η
 = 1, whence
∥ξz∥1 ≤2 ∥ξ∥p
p
and
∥ηz∥∞≤2;
similarly if Re(z) = 1, then
∥ξz∥2 ≤2 ∥ξ∥p/2
p
and
∥ηz∥2 ≤2 ∥η∥p′/2
p′
.
Consider the analytic family of functions on {z ∈C : Re(z) ∈[0, 1]} given by

30
M. Cowling
z →⟨π(·)ξz, ηz⟩.
When Re(z) = 0, these functions are bounded on G, while when Re(z) = 1,
these functions are coeﬃcients of π0, so satisfy Lq+ estimates. When z = 2/p′,
we get ⟨π(·)ξ, η⟩. By a standard complex interpolation argument, this function
on G satisﬁes L2q/p′+ estimates.
There are some important examples of T-actions of groups which do not
have property T. In particular, if G = SL(2, R) and X = G/Γ, where Γ is a
congruence subgroup, that is, for some N in Z+,
Γ =

a b
c d

∈SL(2, Z) : a −1 ≡d −1 ≡b ≡c ≡0
mod N

,
then the action of G on X is a T-action. Indeed, π0 satisﬁes a L4+ estimate.
This is a reformulation of a celebrated result of A. Selberg (generalising a re-
sult of G. Roelcke for SL(2, R)/SL(2, Z) which states, in our language, that for
this choice of Γ, the representation π0 satisﬁes a L2+ estimate). Selberg also
conjectured that π0 satisﬁes an L2+ estimate. This result is usually phrased
in terms of the ﬁrst nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on
the space K\G/Γ, a quotient of the hyperbolic upper half plane; the repre-
sentation theoretic version is due to I. Satake [90].
Similar results were discovered by M. Burger, J.-S. Li and Sarnak [16, 17],
and formulated in terms of the “Ramanujan dual”. It is now known that
every action of a real simple algebraic group G on the quotient space G/Γ
is a T-action, for any lattice Γ in G (arithmetic or not). As pointed out by
M.E.B. Bekka, this follows from the Burger–Sarnak argument and work of
A. Borel and H. Garland [12] (see [9] for more details). The Burger–Sarnak
argument has been reworked by a number of people, including L. Clozel, Oh
and E. Ullmo [26] and Cowling [33].
An observation by C.C. Moore [84] is relevant here; representations of
simple Lie groups with ﬁnite centres which do not weakly contain the trivial
representation automatically satisfy Lp+ estimates.

4 More General Semisimple Groups
In this lecture, I look at questions in graph theory and number theory. The
initial motivation is to shed light on analytical problems, such as ﬁnding the
behaviour of the eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on Riemannian
manifolds, by studying this problem for the eigenvalues of graph Laplacians. It
turns out that certain problems in discrete mathematics can also be attacked
eﬀectively using approaches and results from analysis.
4.1 Graph Theory and its Riemannian Connection
A graph G(V, E), usually written G, is a set V of vertices and a set E of edges,
that is, a symmetric subset of V × V . A path in G from v0 to vn of length n
is a list of vertices [v0, v1, . . . , vn] with the property that (vi−1, vi) ∈E when
i = 1, 2, . . . , n; we consider [v0] to be a path of length 0. The graph is said to
be connected if there is a path between any two vertices. The distance d(v, w)
between vertices v and w in a connected graph is the length of a shortest
path between them. The diameter of a ﬁnite connected graph is the greatest
distance between any pair of vertices. The degree of a vertex v, written deg v,
is the cardinality of the set of vertices at distance 1 from v; the degree of the
graph G is the supremum of the degrees of the vertices. We shall deal with
connected graphs of ﬁnite degree.
For a connected graph G of ﬁnite degree, the graph Laplacian ∆G is deﬁned
as a map on functions on V :
∆Gf(v) = f(v) −
1
deg v

w∈V
d(v,w)=1
f(w).
This operator is bounded on L2(V ) and self-adjoint. It is a natural analogue of
the Laplace–Beltrami operator ∆M on a Riemannian manifold M but, being
bounded, is easier to analyse.
There is already an extensive theory of “approximation” of a Riemannian
manifold M and ∆M by a graph G and ∆G. The underlying philosophy is that
properties of ∆M which are “local” in the manifold and are reﬂected spectrally
at inﬁnity are lost when the manifold is discretised, but that properties of ∆M
which are “global” in the manifold and are reﬂected in the spectrum “near 0”
will be seen in the properties of ∆G0. For some examples in this direction,
see [27, 28, 69].
Interesting examples of graphs arise in the study of semisimple groups
in two ways: as Cayley graphs of discrete groups and as “discrete symmetric
spaces”. We next consider Cayley graphs and then describe the p-adic numbers
and discrete symmetric spaces.

M. Cowling
4.2 Cayley Graphs
Suppose X is a set of generators for a group G, closed under the taking
of inverses. The Cayley graph of (G, X) is the graph G(G, E), where E is
the subset of G × G deﬁned by the condition that (x, y) ∈E if and only if
xy−1 ∈X (or equivalently yx−1 ∈X). The group G acts simply transitively
and isometrically on G(G, E) by left multiplication, so that Cayley graphs are
homogeneous: all points “look alike”. Cayley graphs are good for obtaining
examples of graphs of small degree and small diameter but high cardinality
(these are “expanders”, which are important in discrete mathematics).
Suppose that (un : n ∈N) is a sequence of positive deﬁnite functions on G,
normalised in the sense that un(e) = 1 for all n (where e denotes the identity
of G). Then un = ⟨πn(·)ξn, ξn⟩, where ∥ξn∥= 1. Suppose that |un(x)−1| < ϵn
for all x in X. Then
∥πn(x)ξn −ξn∥2 = ⟨πn(x)ξn −ξn, πn(x)ξn −ξn⟩
= 2 −2 Re⟨πn(x)ξn, ξn⟩,
and so
∥πn(x)ξn −ξn∥≤(2ϵ)1/2.
It follows, by induction, that
∥πn(x1 . . . xm)ξn −ξn∥≤m(2ϵn)1/2
∀x1, . . . , xm ∈X;
indeed
∥πn(x1 . . . xm)ξn −ξn∥≤∥πn(x1 . . . xm−1)(πn(xm)ξn −ξn)∥
+ ∥πn(x1 . . . xm−1)ξn −ξn∥.
Thus if un(x) →1 as n →∞for all x in X, un →1 as n →∞locally
uniformly on G.
Property T may be expressed in the following form: if none of the unitary
representations πn has a trivial subrepresentation, then the corresponding
matrix coeﬃcients un cannot tend to 1 locally uniformly. It becomes possible
to quantify property T, by ﬁnding numbers τG such that
sup
x∈X
|u(x) −1| > τG,
or perhaps (if G is ﬁnitely generated)

x∈X
|u(x) −1| > τG
or

x∈X
|u(x) −1|2
1/2
> τG,
for all normalised positive deﬁnite functions u which are associated to unitary
representations without trivial subrepresentations. (It might be argued, on

the basis of results about the free group, and of its utility in formulae like
inequality (4.1) that this ﬁnal deﬁnition is the best). This quantiﬁcation of
property T leads to estimates for a spectral gap for ∆G, acting on matrix
coeﬃcients of unitary representations. For the normalised positive deﬁnite
function u, equal to ⟨π(·)ξ, ξ⟩,
|u(x)| = |⟨π(x)ξ, ξ⟩| ≤∥π(x)ξ∥∥ξ∥≤1,
and for any complex number z in the closed unit disc,
Re(1 −z) ≥|1 −z|2

which is bounded away from 0 if τG is bounded away from 0 (using any of the
above deﬁnitions).
4.3 An Example Involving Cayley Graphs
Let G denote the group SL(3, Z) of all 3×3 integer matrices with determinant
1, and let X denote the symmetric generating subset
⎧
⎨
⎩
⎡
⎣
1 x12 x13
x21
1 x23
x31 x32
1
⎤
⎦: xij ∈{0, ±1},
|x12| + · · · + |x32| = 1
⎫
⎬
⎭
(that is, all xij but one are equal to 0). Burger [15] estimated τG for this
group (using the ﬁrst deﬁnition). Let π be a unitary representation of SL(3, Z)
in a Hilbert space Hπ, and S a ﬁnite set of generators of SL(3, Z). For
various examples of S and π, he obtains an explicit positive ε such that
maxγ∈S ∥π(γ)ξ −ξ∥/ ∥ξ∥≥ε, for all ξ in the space of π. As he observes,
these results give a partial solution to the problem of giving a quantitative
version of Kazhdan’s property (T) for SL(3, Z).
For any prime number p, let Gp denote the ﬁnite group SL(3, Fp), that is,
the group of matrices of determinant 1 with entries in the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp with
p elements. This is a quotient group of G. Indeed, deﬁne the normal subgroup
Γp of G by
Γp =
⎧
⎨
⎩
⎡
⎣
x11 x12 x13
x21 x22 x23
x31 x32 x33
⎤
⎦∈SL(3, Z) : xij ≡δij
mod p
⎫
⎬
⎭,
where δij is the Kronecker delta; then Gp is isomorphic to G/Γp. A unitary
representation of G/Γp with no trivial subrepresentation lifts canonically to

34
M. Cowling
a unitary representation of G with no trivial subrepresentation, and so the
estimates on the matrix coeﬃcients of all unitary representations of G imply, in
particular, estimates for the matrix coeﬃcients of these lifted representations.
Thus we obtain estimates on the degree of isolation of the trivial representation
of Gp which are uniform in p. A number of estimates of this type have recently
been summarised in the survey of P. Diaconis and L. Saloﬀ-Coste [44].
4.4 The Field of p-adic Numbers
For a prime number p, the p-adic norm on the set of rational numbers Q is
deﬁned by
|0|p = 0
and
|x|p = p−α,
where x = mpα/n, m and n being integers with no factors of p. It is easy to
check that |x|p = 0 only if x = 0, that |xy|p = |x|p|y|p, and that
|x + y|p ≤max{|x|p, |y|p}
∀x, y ∈Q.
The completion of Q in the associated distance dp, that is, dp(x, y) = |x−y|p, is
a totally disconnected locally compact ﬁeld, called the ﬁeld of p-adic numbers,
and written Qp. The algebraic operations of Qp are those of formal series of
the form
∞

n=N
anpn,
where N ∈Z and an ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1}, with “carrying”, for instance,
(−1)pk = (p −1)pk + (−1)pk+1
= (p −1)pk + (p −1)pk+1 + (−1)pk+2
= (p −1)pk + (p −1)pk+1 + (p −1)pk+2 + . . . .
The subset of Qp of all series where N ≥0 is an open and closed subring of Qp,
known as the ring of p-adic integers, and written Op; this is the completion of
Z in Qp. The ﬁeld Qp presents a few surprises to the uninitiated: for example,
if p ≡1 mod 4, then Qp contains a square root of −1. However, Qp does not
contain very many new roots, and the algebraic completion of Qp is of inﬁnite
degree over Qp.
Apart from R and C, the real and complex numbers, the locally compact
complete normed ﬁelds are “local ﬁelds”, that is, they are totally disconnected.
Every local ﬁeld is either a ﬁnite algebraic extension of Qp or a ﬁeld of Laurent
series in one variable over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Like Qp, these all have a compact open
“ring of integers”O. There is a unique translation-invariant measure on any
local ﬁeld which assigns measure 1 to O.

4.5 Lattices in Vector Spaces over Local Fields
Let V be the vector space Qn
p over the local ﬁeld Qp, with the standard basis
{e1, . . . , en}. A lattice L in V is a subset of V of the form
L = {m1v1 + m2v2 + · · · + mnvn : m1, m2, . . . , mn ∈Op},
where {v1, . . . , vn} is a basis for V . The set {v1, . . . , vn} is also called a basis
for L over Op, for obvious reasons. The standard lattice L0 is the lattice with
basis {e1, . . . , en}. All lattices are compact open subsets of V .
Given two lattices L1 and L2, it is possible to ﬁnd a basis {v1, . . . , vn} of
L1 over Op such that, for suitable integers a1, . . . , an,
(4.2) L2 = {m1pa1v1 + m2pa2v2 + · · · + mnpanvn : m1, m2, . . . , mn ∈Op}.
The order of the numbers ai may depend on the basis chosen, but the numbers
themselves do not. This result, known as the invariant factor theorem, may
be found in many texts on algebra, such as C.W. Curtis and I. Reiner [43,
pp. 150–153].
The group GL(n, Qp) acts on the vector space V and hence on the space
L of lattices in V . The stabiliser of the standard lattice L0 is the compact
subgroup GL(n, Op) of invertible Op-valued n × n matrices whose inverses
are also Op-valued (equivalently, whose determinant has norm 1). Thus the
space L may be identiﬁed with the coset space GL(n, Qp)/GL(n, Op). The
group GL(n, Qp) is not semisimple, and this is not quite the analogue of a
Riemannian symmetric space.
One example of a discrete symmetric space may be obtained by restricting
attention to the space L1 of lattices whose volume is equal to that of the
standard lattice. It follows from the invariant factor theorem that L1 may be
identiﬁed with the coset space SL(n, Qp)/SL(n, Op).
The more standard example of a discrete symmetric space is a quotient
space of L. Deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼on L by the stipulation that
L1 ∼L2 if L1 = λL2 for some λ in Qp; the equivalence class of L is written
[L]. Deﬁne d: L × L →N by
d(L1, L2) = max{ai : 1 ≤i ≤n} −min{ai : 1 ≤i ≤n},
where {ai : 1 ≤i ≤n} is as in formula (4.2) above. It is simple to check
that d factors to a distance function on the space [L] of equivalence classes of
lattices. We may identify [L] with the coset space PGL(n, Qp)/PGL(n, Op),
where PGL(n, Qp) is the quotient group GL(n, Qp)/Z, Z being its centre (that
is, the group of nonzero diagonal matrices), and PGL(n, Op) is the image of
GL(n, Op) in PGL(n, Qp). The key to this identiﬁcation is the observation that
the scalar matrix λI moves L to λL, and preserves the equivalence classes. The
space [L] has the structure of a simplicial complex, in which the vertices are the
equivalence classes [L], and the edges are pairs ([L1], [L2]) where d(L1, L2) = 1.
Similar constructions apply when Qp is replaced by another local ﬁeld.

M. Cowling
Perhaps the moral of this is just that a discrete symmetric space is a well
deﬁned combinatorial object; it has “invariant diﬀerence operators” analogous
to the “invariant diﬀerential operators” on a symmetric space, and various
functions and function spaces on a symmetric space have discrete analogues
which are easier to work with. In particular, the formulae for the spherical
functions are easier to deal with, so that, for example, it should be easier to
analyse the heat equation on a discrete symmetric space than on a normal
symmetric space. For the rank one case, compare [36] and [40, 41].
Useful bibliography on discrete symmetric spaces includes [14, 87] (for the
geometric and combinatorial structure), and [80] (for the spherical functions,
Plancherel theorem, . . . ). For the rank one case, these are “trees”(that is,
simply connected graphs), and analysis on these structures was developed by
A. Fig`a-Talamanca and C. Nebbia [47]. More detailed analysis on trees may
be found in, for instance, [40, 41].
4.6 Ad`eles
We conclude this outline of some of the generalisations of semisimple Lie
groups with a brief discussion of the ad`eles and ad`ele groups.
The ring of ad`eles, A, is the “restricted direct product” R×Πp∈P Qp, where
P is the set of prime numbers. An ad`ele is a “vector” (x∞, x2, x3, . . . , xp, . . .),
where x∞∈R, and xp ∈Qp; further, |xp|p > 1 for only ﬁnitely many p
in P. The operations in the ring are componentwise addition, subtraction, and
multiplication. For an ad`ele to be invertible, it is necessary and suﬃcient that
no component be zero, and that |xp|p ̸= 1 for only ﬁnitely many components.
The ring of ad`eles may be topologised by deﬁning a basis of open sets at
0 to be all sets of the form U∞× U2 × U3 × · · · × Up × · · · , where U∞is an
open set containing 0, as is each Up, and all but ﬁnitely many Up are equal to
Op. The translates of these sets by x then form a basis for the topology at x.
Similarly A may be equipped with product measure.
It is possible to form groups such as SL(2, A). One may think either of
matrices with “vector” entries, or equivalently as a “vector” of matrices:

(a∞, a2, · · · ) (b∞, b2, · · · )
(c∞, c2, · · · ) (d∞, d2, · · · )

∼

c∞d∞


.
Because the operations are component-by-component, these are equivalent
formulations.
The rational numbers may be injected diagonally into the ad`eles, that is,
the rational number r corresponds to the ad`ele (r, r, r, . . . ). Then Q “is” a
discrete subring of A, and A/Q is compact.
One of the major goals of number theorists is to understand the unitary
representation λ of SL(2, A) on the space L2(SL(2, A)/SL(2, Q)), and similar
representations involving other groups, such as SL(n, A). For the SL(2) case,
much information is contained in Gel’fand, Graev, and Pyateckii-Shapiro [51].

Applications of Representation Theory to Harmonic Analysis

The group SL(2, A) has unitary representations, which are “restricted tensor
products” of unitary representations of the factors, and quite a bit is known
about how λ decomposes into irreducible components. A number of important
conjectures in number theory may be reformulated in terms of the harmonic
analysis of SL(2, A).
An important recent result is concerned with the representation of G(A)
on L2(G(A)/G(Q)). The space G(A)/G(Q) has ﬁnite volume, so the constant
functions lie in the Hilbert space, and the representation contains a trivial
subrepresentation. Clozel [25] has recently proved a conjecture of A. Lubotzky
and R.J. Zimmer that all the other components of this representation are
isolated away from the trivial representation. A consequence of this is that
there exists p such that each of the other components satisﬁes an Lp+ estimate,
which in turn implies that the restriction of many unitary representations of
G(A) to G(Q) are irreducible (see [10, 11]).

5 Carnot–Carath´eodory Geometry and Group
Representations
In this lecture, following [7], I construct some unitary and uniformly bounded
representations of simple Lie groups of real rank one, using geometric methods.
5.1 A Decomposition for Real Rank One Groups
Theorem 5.1. Suppose that G is a real rank one simple Lie group, with an
Iwasawa decomposition KAN. Then G = KNK, in the sense that every
element g of G may be written (not uniquely) in the form k1nk2, where n ∈N
and k1, k2 ∈N.
Proof. Consider the action of the group G on the associated symmetric space
X (which may be identiﬁed with G/K). It will suﬃce to show that any point
x in X may be written in the form kno, where o is the base point of X (that
is, the point stabilised by K). Suppose that the distance of x from o is d. As
n varies over the connected group N, the point no varies over a subset No
of X which contains o. Since this subset is connected and unbounded, there
exists a point no in No whose distance from o is d. Now K acts transitively
on all the spheres with centre o, so there exists k in K such that kno = x, as
required.
5.2 The Conformal Group of the Sphere in Rn
Stereographic projection from Rn to Sn may be deﬁned by the formula
σ(x) =

∀x ∈Rn,
where (x, t) is shorthand for (x1, . . . , xn, t). It is a conformal map, that is, its
diﬀerential is a multiple Dσ of an orthogonal map. Its Jacobian Jσ is the nth
power of this multiple, that is,
Jσ(x) =

1 + |x|2

−n
∀x ∈Rn.
It is well known that G, the conformal group of the sphere, that is, the group of
all orientation-preserving conformal diﬀeomorphisms of Sn, may be identiﬁed
with SO0(1, n + 1). Let P denote the subgroup of G of conformal maps which
ﬁx the north pole b. By conjugation with σ, we may identify P with the group
of all conformal diﬀeomorphisms of Rn. This is the Euclidean motion group,
which is the semidirect product of the group SO(n) × R+ of conformal linear
maps of Rn (which are all products of rotations and dilations) and the group
of translations of Rn (isomorphic to Rn itself). Then P may be decomposed
as MAN, where MA is the subgroup of P giving linear conformal maps of

39
Rn (that is, σ(SO(n) × Rn)σ−1 and N = σ{τx : x ∈Rn}σ−1, where τx
denotes translation by x on Rn (that is, τxy = x + y). Write K for SO(n).
Then the groups K, M, A and N are those which arise in the Iwasawa and
Bruhat decompositions of G, described in Lecture 1. We can also establish
these decompositions geometrically: for instance, given g in G, there exists
a rotation k of Sn such that gb = kb. Then k−1gb = b, so k−1g ∈P, and
k−1g may be written in the form man, where m ∈M, a ∈A, and n ∈N.
Consequently, g = (km)an, and km ∈K; thus we have shown that G = KAN.
Theorem 5.2. Suppose that Fz(Sn) and Fz(Rn) are function spaces on Sn
and Rn, such that Tz : Fz(Sn) →Fz(Rn) is an isomorphism, where
Tzf = Jz/n+1/2
σ
f ◦σ,
and that translations and rotations act isometrically on F(Rn) and Fz(Sn)
respectively. Then πz : G →End(Fz(Sn)), given by
πz(g)f(x) = Jz/n+1/2
g−1
(x)f(g−1x)
(where Jg is the Jacobian of the conformal map g on Sn), is a representation
of G on Fz(Sn) by isomorphisms. If the maps Tz are isometric, then so is πz.
Proof. Since G = KNK, it suﬃces to show that N acts by isomorphisms
(which are isometric if the map Tz is isometric), since K acts isometrically.
Now
πz(στ −1

by the chain rule and the deﬁnitions, so
∥πz(n)f∥≤∥T −1

∥∥Tz∥∥f∥.
Clearly, if Tz is isometric, then πz is isometric.
Here are some examples. First, if Fz = Lp, where Re(z) = n(1/p −1/2),
then Tz is an isometry, by deﬁnition. In particular, if Re(z) = 0, then πz
acts unitarily on L2(S), giving us the “unitary class-one principal series” of
representations, indicated by the heavy vertical line in the diagram at the end
of this section.
Next, if F = Hs, where
s = −Re(z) ∈

then Tz is an isomorphism. Here
Hs(Rn) = {f ∈S′(Rn) : | · |s ˆf ∈L2(Rn)}
Hs(Sn) = {f ∈L1(Sn) :

(1 + k)sfk ∈L2(Sn)},
where 
k fk is the decomposition of f as a sum of spherical harmonics fk of
degree k.
One proof of this uses the remarkable formula
(5.2)
|1 −σ(x) · σ(y)| = Jσ(x)1/2nJσ(y)1/2n|x −y|
∀x, y ∈N.
Note that |x −y| is the Euclidean distance between x and y in Rn, and that
|1 −p · q|, henceforth written dSn(p, q), is the distance between p and q in
Sn (the length of the chord joining them, not the geodesic distance in the
sphere). This implies that, if s ∈(−n/2, n/2), then

where we integrate using the Riemannian volume element on the sphere. By
putting f = ¯g and taking square roots, we deduce that
∥T−sf∥Hs(Rn) = ∥f∥˜
Hs(Sn) ,
where the Hilbert space ˜Hs(Sn) is deﬁned like Hs(Sn), but with (1 + k)s
replaced by a quotient of Γ functions determined by the spherical harmonic
decomposition of dSn(·, ·) (see, for instance, [67]). More precisely,

where Cs depends only on n and s. Hence π−s acts unitarily on ˜Hs(Sn) when
s ∈(−n/2, n/2), indicated by the heavy horizontal line in the diagram at the
end of this section.
To show that πz acts uniformly boundedly on the Hilbert space ˜Hs(Sn)
when Re(z) = −s and s ∈(−n/2, n/2), we use the fact that TRe z is a unitary
map from ˜Hs(Sn) to Hs(Rn). Now Tzf = mi Im z/n TRe z, where miy denotes
pointwise multiplication by the function Jiy
σ , so it suﬃces to show that the

41
functions miy multiply the spaces Hs(Rn) pointwise. This is a little tedious,
but not hard (see [7]). Thus the region where the representations can be made
uniformly bounded is between the dashed lines in the diagram at the end of
this section.
It is easy to show that πz, as deﬁned in this section, is the same as π1,λ,
as deﬁned in Lecture 1, where λ = (2iz/n)ρ.

5.3 The Groups SU(1, n + 1) and Sp(1, n + 1)

“F-valued inner product” on the right vector space Fn by


j=1

j ¯xj
∀x, x′ ∈Fn.
We denote the projection of F onto the subspace of purely imaginary elements
by ℑ. The spheres S2n+1 in Cn and S4n+3 in Hn+1 are Carnot–Carath´eodory
(generalised CR) manifolds. For p in S2n+1 or S4n+3, we denote the subspace
of the tangent space Tp to the sphere at p of vectors orthogonal to pC or pH
by Up, and endow Up with the restriction of the standard Riemannian metric.
We denote either of these spheres, with its Carnot–Carath´eodory structure
(that is, a privileged nonintegrable subbundle of the tangent bundle, equipped
with an inner product), by S.
A diﬀeomorphism f : S →S is said to be Carnot–Carath´eodory contact
if f∗maps Up into Uf(p) for all p, and Carnot–Carath´eodory conformal if it

42
M. Cowling
is contact and in addition f∗

Up is a multiple of an orthogonal map for all p.
The groups SU(1, n+1) and Sp(1, n+1) may be identiﬁed with the conformal
groups of S2n+1 (in the complex case) and S4n+3 (in the quaternionic case).
The analogue of the stereographic projection is the Cayley transform from
a Heisenberg-type group N to the sphere S. We deﬁne N to be the set Fn ×
ℑ(F), equipped with the multiplication
(x, t)(x′, t′) = (x + x′, t + t′ + 1
2ℑ(x′ · x))
∀(x, t), (x′, t′) ∈Fn × ℑ(F).
The homogeneous dimension Q of N is deﬁned to be 2n + 2 in the complex
case and 4n+6 in the quaternionic case. The homogeneous dimension double-
counts the dimension of the “missing directions”. The Cayley transform is the
map σ: N →S, given by
σ(x, t) =

for all (x, t) in N. It is a (nontrivial) exercise in calculus to show that σ is
Carnot–Carath´eodory conformal when N is given the left-invariant Carnot–
Carath´eodory structure which at the group identity (0, 0) is Fn (that is,
{(x, 0) : x ∈Fn}) with its standard inner product. The Jacobian of the
transformation is given by the Qth power of the dilation factor, that is,
Jσ(x, t) =

.
The representations that we wish to investigate are given by the formula
πz(g)f(x) = Jz/Q+1/2
g−1
(x)f(g−1x).
We deﬁne the nonhomogeneous distance dS on S by
dS(p, q) = |1 −p · q|,
and the nonhomogeneous distance dN on N to be the left-invariant distance
such that
dN((0, 0), (x, z)) =
|x|4

.
Then, as proved geometrically in [7], the analogue of the remarkable formula
(5.2) is
dS(σ(x), σ(y)) = Jσ(x)1/2Q Jσ(y)1/2Q dN(x, y).
We now deﬁne the map Tz taking functions on S to functions on N much as
before:
Tzf(x, t) = Jσ(x, t)z/Q+1/2f(σ(x, t))
(compare with (5.1)), and a very similar calculation to (5.3) shows that

and ˜Hs(S) is deﬁned similarly on S.
If G = SU(1, n + 1), then S = S2n+1 and N is C × (iR) (setwise). In
this case, πz acts unitarily on L2(S) where Re(z) = 0, giving us the unitary
class-one principal series of representations (indicated by the heavy vertical
line in the diagram below). Further, the two kernels d−2s−Q
S
and d−2s−Q
N
are
positive deﬁnite and the “Sobolev spaces” are deﬁned for all s in (−Q/2, Q/2)
(the calculations may be found in [67] for dS, and in [31] for dN). This gives
a construction of the class-one complementary series (indicated by the heavy
horizontal line in the diagram below). Further, it can be shown that pointwise
multiplication by purely imaginary powers of Jσ is a bounded map on ˜Hs(N)
for all s in this range, and so when Re(z) ∈(−Q/2, Q/2) the representations
πz are uniformly bounded on ˜Hs(S), where s = −Re z (see [7]).

Class-one Unitary Representations of SU0(1, n + 1)
For Sp(1, n + 1), the picture is diﬀerent. The representations πz act by
isometries on Lp spaces when −2n −3 ≤Re(z) ≤2n + 3, and we might hope
that all the representations πx for x in (−2n −3, 2n + 3) might be unitary
on some Hilbert space, and all the representations πz for z inside this strip
might be made to act uniformly boundedly on some Hilbert space. When

44
M. Cowling
Re(z) = 0, we again obtain unitary representations on L2(S), the unitary
class-one principal series, represented by the heavy vertical line in the diagram
below.
However, ˜Hs(S) and ˜Hs(N) are only Hilbert spaces when the kernels
dS(·, ·)−2s−Q and dN(·, ·)−2s−Q are positive (semi) deﬁnite, and this is only
while
−2n −1 ≤s ≤2n + 1.
Nevertheless, at the expense of loosing the isometry of the representation it is
possible to modify the spaces ˜Hs, taking more standard Sobolev spaces Hs(S)
(spaces of functions with s derivatives in L2(S)—but only derivatives in the
Carnot–Carath´eodory directions) and show that the representations may still
be made uniformly bounded. This is achieved in [7].

Class-one Unitary Representations of Sp0(1, n + 1)
It is easy to show that πz, as deﬁned in this section, is the same as π1,λ,
as deﬁned in Lecture 1, where λ = (2iz/Q)ρ; this applies for both the unitary
and symplectic groups.
Cowling [30] showed that it is possible to make the representations inside
the strip uniformly bounded, but this paper provides no control on the norms
of the representations. Then Cowling and Haagerup [34] showed that it is
possible to control the spherical functions associated to the representations
πx, where −Q/2 < x < Q/2. A.H. Dooley [45] has recently shown that, for
the group Sp(1, n + 1), it is possible to choose a “Sobolev type” norm on N
(this is called the “noncompact picture”) so that ∥πx∥2 ≤2n −1 whenever
−Q/2 < x < Q/2. This is the best possible constant. It has also been shown,

working on the sphere (this is the “compact picture”), that the representations
of Sp(1, n+1) have special properties which show that this group satisﬁes the
Baum–Connes conjecture “with coeﬃcients” (see [7, 68]). It would be nice to
obtain a similar best possible result for the “picture changing” version, that
is, to show that |||Ts||||||T −1
s
||| ≤(2n −1)1/2, as this would unify all the known
results in this direction, and be best possible. This result should presumably
be approached from a geometric point of view; more relevant information on
the geometry of the spaces N and K/M is in the papers [7, 8]. There has also
been much work on understanding these representations from a diﬀerential
geometric point of view; see, for instance, [13], and other papers by these
authors.
It may also be possible to extend some of the ideas here to more general
semisimple groups: the Cayley transform treated here arises by composition
of various natural mappings which appear when one considers the Iwasawa
and Bruhat decompositions:
N →NMA ¯N/MA ¯N →G/MA ¯N = KA ¯N/MA ¯N ∼= K/M.

Introduction
The Langlands Program, conceived as a bridge between Number Theory and
Automorphic Representations [L], has recently expanded into such areas as
Geometry and Quantum Field Theory and exposed a myriad of unexpected
connections and dualities between seemingly unrelated disciplines. There is
something deeply mysterious in the ways the Langlands dualities manifest
themselves and this is what makes their study so captivating.
In this review we will focus on the geometric Langlands correspondence for
complex algebraic curves, which is a particular brand of the general theory.

Its origins and the connections with the classical Langlands correspondence
are discussed in detail elsewhere (see, in particular, the reviews [F2, F6]),
and we will not try to repeat this here. The general framework is the fol-
lowing: let X be a smooth projective curve over C and G be a simple Lie
group over C. Denote by LG the Langlands dual group of G (we recall this
notion in Section 2.3). Suppose that we are given a principal LG-bundle F on
X equipped with a ﬂat connection. This is equivalent to F being a holomor-
phic principal LG-bundle equipped with a holomorphic connection ∇(which
is automatically ﬂat as the complex dimension of X is equal to one). The pair
(F, ∇) may also be thought of as a LG-local system on X, or as a homomor-
phism π1(X) →LG (corresponding to a base point in X and a trivialization
of the ﬁber of F at this point).
The global Langlands correspondence is supposed to assign to E = (F, ∇)
an object AutE, called Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue E, on the moduli
stack BunG of holomorphic G-bundles on X:
holomorphic LG-bundles
with connection on X
−→
Hecke eigensheaves on BunG
E →AutE
(see, e.g., [F6], Sect. 6.1, for the deﬁnition of Hecke eigensheaves). It is ex-
pected that there is a unique irreducible Hecke eigensheaf AutE (up to iso-
morphism) if E is suﬃciently generic.
The Hecke eigensheaves AutE have been constructed, and the Langlands
correspondence proved, in [FGV, Ga2] for G = GLn and an arbitrary irre-
ducible GLn-local system, and in [BD1] for an arbitrary simple Lie group G
and those LG-local systems which admit the structure of a LG-oper (which is
recalled below).
Recently, A. Kapustin and E. Witten [KW] have related the geometric
Langlands correspondence to the S-duality of supersymmetric four-dimen-
sional Yang-Mills theories, bringing into the realm of the Langlands corre-
spondence new ideas and insights from quantum physics.
So far, we have considered the unramiﬁed LG-local systems. In other
words, the corresponding ﬂat connection has no poles. But what should hap-
pen if we allow the connection to be singular at ﬁnitely many points of X?
This ramiﬁed geometric Langlands correspondence is the subject of
this paper. Here are the most important adjustments that one needs to make
in order to formulate this correspondence:
•
The moduli stack BunG of G-bundles has to be replaced by the moduli
stack of G-bundles together with the level structures at the ramiﬁcation
points. We call them the enhanced moduli stacks. Recall that a level struc-
ture of order N is a trivialization of the bundle on the Nth inﬁnitesimal
neighborhood of the point. The order of the level structure should be at
least the order of the pole of the connection at this point.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
53
•
At the points at which the connection has regular singularity (pole of order
1) one can take instead of the level structure, a parabolic structure, i.e., a
reduction of the ﬁber of the bundle to a Borel subgroup of G.
•
The Langlands correspondence will assign to a ﬂat LG-bundle E = (F, ∇)
with ramiﬁcation at the points y1, . . . , yn a category AutE of Hecke
eigensheaves on the corresponding enhanced moduli stack with eigen-
value E|X\{y1,...,yn}, which is a subcategory of the category of (twisted)
D-modules on this moduli stack.
If E is unramiﬁed, then we may consider the category AutE on the moduli
stack BunG itself. We then expect that for generic E this category is equivalent
to the category of vector spaces: its unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible
object is AutE discussed above, and all other objects are direct sums of copies
of AutE. Because this category is expected to have such a simple structure, it
makes sense to say that the unramiﬁed geometric Langlands correspondence
assigns to an unramiﬁed LG-local system on X a single Hecke eigensheaf,
rather than a category. This is not possible for general ramiﬁed local systems.
The questions that we are facing now are
(1) How to construct the categories of Hecke eigensheaves for ramiﬁed local
systems?
(2) How to describe them in terms of the Langlands dual group LG?
In this article I will review an approach to these questions which has been
developed by D. Gaitsgory and myself in [FG2].
The idea goes back to the construction of A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld
[BD1] of the unramiﬁed geometric Langlands correspondence, which may be
interpreted in terms of a localization functor. Functors of this type were in-
troduced by A. Beilinson and J. Bernstein [BB] in representation theory of
simple Lie algebras. In our situation this functor sends representations of the
aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra g to twisted D-modules on BunG, or its enhanced
versions. As explained in [F6], these D-modules may be viewed as sheaves
of conformal blocks (or coinvariants) naturally arising in the framework of
Conformal Field Theory.
The aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra g is the universal one-dimensional central
extension of the loop algebra g((t)). The representation categories of g have a
parameter κ, called the level, which determines the scalar by which a generator
of the one-dimensional center of g acts on representations. We consider a
particular value κc of this parameter, called the critical level. The completed
enveloping algebra of an aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra acquires an unusually large
center at the critical level and this makes the structure of the corresponding
category gκc -mod very rich and interesting. B. Feigin and I have shown [FF3,
F3] that this center is canonically isomorphic to the algebra of functions on
the space of LG-opers on D×. Opers are bundles on D× with ﬂat connection
and an additional datum (as deﬁned by Drinfeld-Sokolov [DS] and Beilinson-
Drinfeld [BD1]; we recall the deﬁnition below). Remarkably, their structure

54
E. Frenkel
group turns out to be not G, but the Langlands dual group LG, in agreement
with the general Langlands philosophy.
This result means that the category gκc -mod of (smooth) g-modules of
critical level “lives” over the space OpLG(D×) of LG-opers on the punctured
disc D×. For each χ ∈OpLG(D×) we have a “ﬁber” category gκc -modχ
whose objects are g-modules on which the center acts via the central character
corresponding to χ. Applying the localization functors to these categories,
and their K-equivariant subcategories gκc -modK
χ for various subgroups K ⊂
G[[t]], we obtain categories of Hecke eigensheaves on the moduli spaces of
G-bundles on X with level (or parabolic) structures.
Thus, the localization functor gives us a powerful tool for converting local
categories of representations of g into global categories of Hecke eigensheaves.
This is a new phenomenon which does not have any obvious analogues in the
classical Langlands correspondence.
The simplest special case of this construction gives us the Beilinson-
Drinfeld Hecke eigensheaves AutE on BunG corresponding to unramiﬁed LG-
local systems admitting the oper structure. Motivated by this, we wish to
apply the localization functors to more general categories gκc -modK
χ of g-
modules of critical level, corresponding to opers on X with singularities, or
ramiﬁcations.
These categories gκc -modχ are assigned to LG-opers χ on the punctured
disc D×. It is important to realize that the formal loop group G((t)) naturally
acts on each of these categories via its adjoint action on gκc (because the
center is invariant under the adjoint action of G((t))). Thus, we assign to each
oper χ a categorical representation of G((t)) on gκc -modχ.
This is analogous to the classical local Langlands correspondence. Let
F be a local non-archimedian ﬁeld, such as the ﬁeld Fq((t)) or the ﬁeld of p-adic
numbers. Let W ′
F be the Weil-Deligne group of F, which is a version of the
Galois group of F (we recall the deﬁnition in Section 2.1). The local Lang-
lands correspondence relates the equivalence classes of irreducible (smooth)
representations of the group G(F) (or “L-packets” of such representations)
and the equivalence classes of (admissible) homomorphisms W ′
F →LG. In the
geometric setting we replace these homomorphisms by ﬂat LG-bundles on D×
(or by LG-opers), the group G(F) by the loop group G((t)) and representations
of G(F) by categorical representations of G((t)).
This analogy is very suggestive, as it turns out that the structure of the
categories gκc -modχ (and their K-equivariant subcategories gκc -modK
χ ) is
similar to the structure of irreducible representations of G(F) (and their sub-
spaces of K-invariants). We will see examples of this parallelism in Sects. 7
and 8 below. This means that what we are really doing is developing a local
Langlands correspondence for loop groups.
To summarize, our strategy [FG2] for constructing the global geometric
Langlands correspondence has two parts:

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
55
(1) the local part: describing the structure of the categories of g-modules of
critical level, and
(2) the global part: applying the localization functor to these categories to
obtain the categories of Hecke eigensheaves on enhanced moduli spaces of
G-bundles.
We expect that these localization functors are equivalences of categories
(at least, in the generic situation), and therefore we can infer a lot of informa-
tion about the global categories by studying the local categories gκc -modχ of
g-modules. Thus, the local categories gκc -modχ take the center stage.
In this paper I review the results and conjectures of [FG1]–[FG6] with
the emphasis on unramiﬁed and tamely ramiﬁed local systems. (I also discuss
the case of irregular singularities at the end.) In particular, our study of the
categories of gκc-modules leads us to the following conjecture. (For related
results, see [AB, ABG, Bez1, Bez2].)
Suppose that E = (F, ∇), where F is a LG-bundle and ∇is a connection on
F with regular singularity at a single point y ∈X and unipotent monodromy
(this is easy to generalize to multiple points). Let M = exp(2πiu), where
u ∈LG be a representative of the conjugacy class of the monodromy of
∇around y. Denote by Spu the Springer ﬁber of u, the variety of Borel
subalgebras of Lg containing u. The category AutE of Hecke eigensheaves
with eigenvalue E may then be realized as a subcategory of the category of
D-modules on the moduli stack of G-bundles on X with parabolic structure
at the point y. We have the following conjectural description of the derived
category of AutE:
Db(AutE) ≃Db(QCoh(SpDG
u )),
where QCoh(SpDG
u ) is the category of quasicoherent sheaves on a suitable
“DG enhancement” of SpDG
u . This is a category of diﬀerential graded (DG)
modules over a sheaf of DG algebras whose zeroth cohomology is the structure
sheaf of SpDG
u
(we discuss this in detail in Section 9).
Thus, we expect that the geometric Langlands correspondence attaches
to a LG-local system on a Riemann surface with regular singularity at a
puncture, a category which is closely related to the variety of Borel subgroups
containing the monodromy around the puncture. We hope that further study
of the categories of g-modules will help us to ﬁnd a similar description of the
Langlands correspondence for connections with irregular singularities.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 1 we review the Beilinson-
Drinfeld construction in the unramiﬁed case, in the framework of localiza-
tion functors from representation categories of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras to
D-modules on on BunG. This will serve as a prototype for our construction of
more general categories of Hecke eigensheaves, and it motivates us to study
categories of g-modules of critical level. We wish to interpret these categories
in the framework of the local geometric Langlands correspondence for loop
groups. In order to do that, we ﬁrst recall in Sect. 2 the setup of the classi-
cal Langlands correspondence. Then in Sect. 3 we explain the passage to the

56
E. Frenkel
geometric context. In Sect. 4 we describe the structure of the center at the crit-
ical level and the isomorphism with functions on opers. In Sect. 5 we discuss
the connection between the local Langlands parameters (LG-local systems on
the punctured disc) and opers. We introduce the categorical representations
of loop groups corresponding to opers and the corresponding categories of
Harish-Chandra modules in Sect. 6. We discuss these categories in detail in
the unramiﬁed case in Sect. 7, paying particular attention to the analogies be-
tween the classical and the geometric settings. In Sect. 8 we do the same in the
tamely ramiﬁed case. We then apply localization functor to these categories
in Sect. 9 to obtain various results and conjectures on the global Langlands
correspondence, both for regular and irregular singularities.
Much of the material of this paper is borrowed from my new book [F7],
where I refer the reader for more details, in particular, for background on
representation theory of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras of critical level.
Finally, I note that in a forthcoming paper [GW] the geometric Langlands
correspondence with tame ramiﬁcation is studied from the point of view of
dimensional reduction of four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

1 The Unramiﬁed Global Langlands Correspondence
Our goal in this section is to construct Hecke eigensheaves AutE correspond-
ing to unramiﬁed LG-local systems E = (F, ∇) on X. By deﬁnition, AutE
is a D-module on BunG. We would like to construct AutE by applying a
localization functor to representations of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra g.
Throughout this paper, unless speciﬁed otherwise, we let g be a simple Lie
algebra and G the corresponding connected and simply-connected algebraic
group.
The key observation used in constructing the localization functor is that
for a simple Lie group G the moduli stack BunG of G-bundles on X has a
realization as a double quotient. Namely, let x be a point of X. Denote by
Kx the completion of the ﬁeld of rational functions on X at x, and by Ox
its ring of integers. If we choose a coordinate t at x, then we may identify
Kx ≃C((t)), Ox ≃C[[t]]. But in general there is no preferred coordinate, and
so it is better not to use these identiﬁcations. Now let G(Kx) ≃G((t)) be
the formal loop group corresponding to the punctured disc D×
x around x.

It has two subgroups: one is G(Ox) ≃G[[t]] and the other is Gout, the group
of algebraic maps X\x →G. Then, according to [BeLa, DrSi], the algebraic
stack BunG is isomorphic to the double quotient
(1.1)
BunG ≃Gout\G(Kx)/G(Ox).
Intuitively, any G-bundle may be trivialized on the formal disc Dx and on
X\x. The transition function is then an element of G(Kx), which characterizes
the bundle uniquely up to the right action of G(Ox) and the left action of Gout
corresponding to changes of trivializations on Dx and X\x, respectively.
The localization functor that we need is a special case of the following
general construction. Let g be a Lie algebra and K a Lie group (g, K) whose
Lie algebra is contained in g. The pair (g, K) is called a Harish-Chandra pair.
We will assume that K is connected. A g-module M is called K-equivariant
if the action of the Lie subalgebra Lie K ⊂g on M may be exponentiated to
an action of the Lie group K. Let g -modK be the category of K-equivariant
g-modules.
Now suppose that H is another subgroup of G. Let DH\G/K -mod be
the category of D-modules on H\G/K. Then there is a localization functor
[BB, BD1] (see also [F6, FB])
∆: g -modK →DH\G/K -mod .
Now let g be a one-dimensional central extension of g which becomes trivial
when restricted to the Lie subalgebras Lie K and Lie H. Suppose that this
central extension can be exponentiated to a central extension G of the corre-
sponding Lie group G. Then we obtain a C×-bundle H\ G/K over H\G/K.
Let L be the corresponding line bundle and DL the sheaf of diﬀerential oper-
ators acting on L. Then we have a functor
∆L : g -modK →DL -mod .
In our case we take the formal loop group G(Kx), and the subgroups
K = G(Ox) and H = Gout of G(Kx). We also consider the so-called critical
central extension of G(Kx). Let us ﬁrst discuss the corresponding central
extension of the Lie algebra g ⊗Kx. Choose a coordinate t at x and identify
Kx ≃C((t)). Then g ⊗Kx is identiﬁed with g((t)). Let κ be an invariant
bilinear form on g. The aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra gκ is deﬁned as the
central extension
0 →C1 →gκ →g((t)) →0.
As a vector space, it is equal to the direct sum g((t))⊕C1, and the commutation
relations read
(1.2)
[A ⊗f(t), B ⊗g(t)] = [A, B] ⊗f(t)g(t) −(κ(A, B) Res fdg)1,
and 1 is a central element, which commutes with everything else. For a simple
Lie algebra g all invariant inner products are proportional to each other.

58
E. Frenkel
Therefore the Lie algebras gκ are isomorphic to each other for non-zero inner
products κ.
Note that the restriction of the second term in (1.2) to the Lie subalgebra
g⊗tNC[[t]], where N ∈Z+, is equal to zero, and so it remains a Lie subalgebra
of gκ. A gκ-module is called smooth if every vector in it is annihilated by
this Lie subalgebra for suﬃciently large N. We deﬁne the category gκ -mod
whose objects are smooth gκ-modules on which the central element 1 acts
as the identity. The morphisms are homomorphisms of representations of gκ.
Throughout this paper, unless speciﬁed otherwise, by a “gκ-module” will al-
ways mean a module on which the central element 1 acts as the identity.1 We
will refer to κ as the level.
Now observe that formula (1.2) is independent of the choice of coordinate t
at x ∈X and therefore deﬁnes a central extension of g⊗Kx, which we denote
by gκ,x. One can show that this central extension may be exponentiated to a
central extension of the group G(Kx) if κ satisﬁes a certain integrality condi-
tion, namely, κ = kκ0, where k ∈Z and κ0 is the inner product normalized
by the condition that the square of the length of the maximal root is equal to
2. A particular example of the inner product which satisﬁes this condition is
the critical level κc deﬁned by the formula
(1.3)
κc(A, B) = −1
2 Trg ad A ad B.
Thus, κc is equal to minus one half of the Killing form on g.2 When κ = κc
representation theory of gκ changes dramatically because the completed
enveloping algebra of gκ acquires a large center (see below).
Let Gx be the corresponding critical central extension of G(Kx). It is
known (see [BD1]) that in this case the corresponding line bundle L is the
square root K1/2 of the canonical line bundle on BunG.3 Now we are ready to
apply the localization functor in the situation where our group is G(Kx), with
the two subgroups K = G(Ox) and H = Gout, so that the double quotient
H\G/K is BunG.4 We choose L = K1/2. Then we have a localization functor
∆κc,x : gκc,x -modG(Ox) →Dκc -mod .
We will apply this functor to a particular gκc,x-module.
To construct this module, let us ﬁrst deﬁne the vacuum module over gκc,x
as the induced module
V0,x = Ind
gκ,x
g⊗Ox⊕C1C,
1 Note that we could have 1 act instead as λ times the identity for λ ∈C×; but
the corresponding category would just be equivalent to the category gλκ -mod.
2 It is also equal to −h∨κ0, where h∨is the dual Coxeter number of g.
3 Recall that by our assumption G is simply-connected. In this case there is a
unique square root.
4 Since BunG is an algebraic stack, one needs to be careful in applying the local-
ization functor. The appropriate formalism has been developed in [BD1].

where g ⊗Ox acts by 0 on C and 1 acts as the identity. According to the
results of [FF3, F3], we have
Endgκc V0,x ≃Fun OpLG(Dx),
where OpLG(Dx) is the space of LG-opers on the formal disc Dx = Spec Ox
around x. We discuss this in detail in Section 4.
Now, given χx ∈OpLG(Dx), we obtain a maximal ideal I(χx) in the
algebra Endgκc V0,x. Let V0(χx) be the gκc,x-module which is the quotient of
V0,x by the image of I(χx) (it is non-zero, as explained in Section 7.3). The
module V0,x is clearly G(Ox)-equivariant, and hence so is V0(χx). Therefore
V0(χx) is an object of the category gκc,x -modG(Ox).
We now apply the localization functor ∆κc,x to V0(χx). The following
theorem is due to Beilinson and Drinfeld [BD1].
Theorem 1. (1) The Dκc-module ∆κc,x(V0(χx)) is non-zero if and only if
there exists a global Lg-oper on X, χ ∈OpLG(X) such that χx ∈OpLG(Dx)
is the restriction of χ to Dx.
(2) If this holds, then ∆κc,x(V0(χx)) depends only on χ and is independent
of the choice of x in the sense that for any other point y ∈X, if χy = χ|Dy,
then ∆κc,x(V0(χx)) ≃∆κc,y(V0(χy)).
(3) For any χ = (F, ∇, FLB) ∈OpLG(X) the Dκc-module ∆κc,x(V0(χx))
is a non-zero Hecke eigensheaf with the eigenvalue Eχ = (F, ∇).
Thus, for any χ ∈OpLG(X), the Dκc-module ∆κc,x(V0(χx)) is the sought-
after Hecke eigensheaf AutEχ corresponding to the LG-local system Eχ under
the global geometric Langlands correspondence.5 For an outline of the proof
of this theorem from [BD1], see [F6], Sect. 9.4.
A drawback of this construction is that not all LG-local systems on X ad-
mit the structure of an oper. In fact, under our assumption that G is simply-
connected (and so LG is of adjoint type), the local systems, or ﬂat bundles
(F, ∇), on a smooth projective curve X that admit an oper structure corre-
spond to a unique LG-bundle on X described as follows (see [BD1]). Let Ω1/2
X
be a square root of the canonical line bundle ΩX. There is a unique (up to an
isomorphism) non-trivial extension
0 →Ω1/2
X
→F0 →Ω−1/2
X
→0.
Let FP GL2 be the PGL2-bundle corresponding to the rank two vector bundle
F0. Note that it does not depend on the choice of Ω1/2
X . This is the oper
bundle for PGL2. We deﬁne the oper bundle FLG for a general simple Lie
group LG of adjoint type as the push-forward of FP GL2 with respect to a
principal embedding PGL2  →G (see Section 4.3).
5 More precisely, AutEχ is the D-module ∆κc,x(V0(χx)) ⊗K−1/2, but here and
below we will ignore the twist by K1/2.

60
E. Frenkel
For each ﬂat connection ∇on the oper bundle FLG there exists a unique
LB-reduction FLB satisfying the oper condition. Therefore OpG(D) is a subset
of LocLG(X), which is the ﬁber of the forgetful map LocLG(X) →BunLG over
FLG.
Theorem 1 gives us a construction of Hecke eigensheaves for LG-local sys-
tem that belong to the locus of opers. For a general LG-local system outside
this locus, the above construction may be generalized as discussed at the end
of Section 9.2 below.
Thus, Theorem 1, and its generalization to other unramiﬁed LG-local sys-
tems, give us an eﬀective tool for constructing Hecke eigensheaves on BunG.
It is natural to ask whether it can be generalized to the ramiﬁed case if we
consider more general representations of gκc,x. The goal of this paper is to
explain how to do that.
We will see below that the completed universal enveloping algebra of gκc,x
contains a large center. It is isomorphic to the algebra Fun OpLG(D×
x ) of
functions on the space OpLG(D×
x ) of LG-opers on the punctured disc D×
x .
For χx ∈OpLG(D×
x ), let gκc,x -modχx be the full subcategory of gκc,x -mod
whose objects are gκc,x-modules on which the center acts according to the
character corresponding to χx.
The construction of Hecke eigensheaves now breaks into two steps:
(1) we study the Harish-Chandra categories gκc,x -modK
χx for various sub-
groups K ⊂G(Ox);
(2) we apply the localization functors to these categories.
The simplest case of this construction is precisely the Beilinson-Drinfeld
construction explained above. In this case we take χx to be a point in the
subspace OpLG(Dx) ⊂OpLG(D×
x ). Then the category gκc,x -modG(Ox)
χx
is
equivalent to the category of vector spaces: its unique up to an isomorphism
irreducible object is the above V0(χx), and all other objects are direct sums
of copies of V0(χx) (see [FG1] and Theorem 3 below). Therefore the local-
ization functor ∆κc,x is determined by ∆κc,x(V0(χx)), which is described in
Theorem 1. It turns out to be the desired Hecke eigensheaf AutEχ. More-
over, we expect that the functor ∆κc,x sets up an equivalence between
gκc,x -modG(Ox)
χx
and the category of Hecke eigensheaves on BunG with eigen-
value Eχ.
For general opers χx, with ramiﬁcation, the (local) categories gκc,x -modK
χx
are more complicated, as we will see below, and so are the corresponding
(global) categories of Hecke eigensheaves. In order to understand the structure
of the global categories, we need to study ﬁrst of local categories of gκc,x-
modules. Using the localization functor, we can then understand the structure
of the global categories. We will consider examples of the local categories in
the following sections.
It is natural to view our study of the local categories gκc,x -modχx and
gκc,x -modK
χx as a geometric analogue of the local Langlands correspondence.
We will explain this point of view in the next section.

2 Classical Local Langlands Correspondence
The local Langlands correspondence relates smooth representations of reduc-
tive algebraic groups over local ﬁelds and representations of the Galois group
of this ﬁeld. In this section we deﬁne these objects and explain the main
features of this correspondence. As the material of this section serves moti-
vational purposes, we will only mention those aspects of this story that are
most relevant for us. For a more detailed treatment, we refer the reader to the
informative surveys [Vog, Ku] and references therein.
The local Langlands correspondence may be formulated for any local non-
archimedian ﬁeld. There are two possibilities: either F is the ﬁeld Qp of p-adic
numbers or a ﬁnite extension of Qp, or F is the ﬁeld Fq((t)) of formal Laurent
power series with coeﬃcients in Fq, the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements (where q
is a power of a prime number). For the sake of deﬁniteness, in what follows
we will restrict ourselves to the second case.
2.1 Langlands Parameters
Consider the group GLn(F), where F = Fq((t)). A representation of GLn(F)
on a complex vector space V is a homomorphism π : GLn(F) →End V such
that π(gh) = π(g)π(h) and π(1) = Id. Deﬁne a topology on GLn(F) by
stipulating that the base of open neighborhoods of 1 ∈GLn(F) is formed by
the congruence subgroups
KN = {g ∈GLn(Fq[[t]]) | g ≡1 mod tN},
N ∈Z+.
For each v ∈V we obtain a map π(·)v : GLn(F) →V, g →π(g)v. A repre-
sentation (V, π) is called smooth if the map π(·)v is continuous for each v,
where we give V the discrete topology. In other words, V is smooth if for any
vector v ∈V there exists N ∈Z+ such that
π(g)v = v,
∀g ∈KN.
We are interested in describing the equivalence classes of irreducible
smooth representations of GLn(F). Surprisingly, those turn out to be related
to objects of a diﬀerent kind: n-dimensional representations of the Galois
group of F.
Recall that the algebraic closure of F is a ﬁeld obtained by adjoining to
F the roots of all polynomials with coeﬃcients in F. However, in the case
when F = Fq((t)) some of the extensions of F may be non-separable. We
wish to avoid the non-separable extensions, because they do not contribute
to the Galois group. Let F be the maximal separable extension inside a given
algebraic closure of F. It is uniquely deﬁned up to an isomorphism.
Let Gal(F/F) be the absolute Galois group of F. Its elements are the
automorphisms σ of the ﬁeld F such that σ(y) = y for all y ∈F.

62
E. Frenkel
Now set F = Fq((t)). Observe that we have a natural map Gal(F/F) →
Gal(Fq/Fq) obtained by applying an automorphism of F to Fq ⊂F. The group
Gal(Fq/Fq) is isomorphic to the proﬁnite completion Z of Z (see, e.g., [F6],
Sect. 1.3). Its subgroup Z ⊂Z is generated by the geometric Frobenius
element which is inverse to the automorphism x →xq of Fq. Let WF be the
preimage of the subgroup Z ⊂Gal(Fq/Fq). This is the Weil group of F.
Denote by ν be the corresponding homomorphism WF →Z.
Now let W ′
F = WF ⋉C be the semi-direct product of WF and the one-
dimensional complex additive group C, where WF acts on C by the formula
(2.1)
σxσ−1 = qν(σ)x,
σ ∈WF , x ∈C.
This is the Weil-Deligne group of F.
An n-dimensional complex representation of W ′
F is by deﬁnition a ho-
momorphism ρ′ : W ′
F →GLn(C) which may be described as a pair (ρ, N),
where ρ is an n-dimensional representation of WF , N ∈GLn(C), and we have
ρ(σ)Nρ(σ)−1 = qν(σ)ρ(N) for all σ ∈WF . The group WF is topological, with
respect to the Krull topology (in which the open neighborhoods of the identity
are the normal subgroups of ﬁnite index). The representation (ρ, N) is called
admissible if ρ is continuous (equivalently, factors through a ﬁnite quotient
of WF ) and semisimple, and N is a unipotent element of GLn(C).
The group W ′
F was introduced by P. Deligne [De2]. The idea is that by
adjoining the unipotent element N to WF one obtains a group whose complex
admissible representations are the same as continuous ℓ-adic representations
of WF (where ℓ̸= p is a prime).
2.2 The Local Langlands Correspondence for GLn
Now we are ready to state the local Langlands correspondence for the group
GLn over a local non-archimedian ﬁeld F. It is a bijection between two diﬀer-
ent sorts of data. One is the set of the equivalence classes of irreducible smooth
representations of GLn(F). The other is the set of equivalence classes of
n-dimensional admissible representations of W ′
F . We represent it schematically
as follows:
n-dimensional admissible
representations of W ′
F
⇐⇒
irreducible smooth
representations of GLn(F)
This correspondence is supposed to satisfy an overdetermined system of
constraints which we will not recall here (see, e.g., [Ku]).
The local Langlands correspondence for GLn is a theorem. In the case
when F = Fq((t)) it has been proved in [LRS], and when F = Qp or its ﬁnite
extension in [HT] and also in [He].

2.3 Generalization to Other Reductive Groups
Let us replace the group GLn by an arbitrary connected reductive group G
over a local non-archimedian ﬁeld F. The group G(F) is also a topological
group, and there is a notion of smooth representation of G(F) on a complex
vector space. It is natural to ask whether one can relate irreducible smooth
representations of G(F) to representations of the Weil-Deligne group W ′
F . This
question is addressed in the general local Langlands conjectures. It would take
us too far aﬁeld to try to give here a precise formulation of these conjectures.
So we will only indicate some of the objects involved referring the reader to
the articles [Vog, Ku] where these conjectures are described in great detail.
Recall that in the case when G = GLn the irreducible smooth representa-
tions are parametrized by admissible homomorphisms W ′
F →GLn(C). In the
case of a general reductive group G, the representations are conjecturally para-
metrized by admissible homomorphisms from W ′
F to the so-called Langlands
dual group LG, which is deﬁned over C.
In order to explain the notion of the Langlands dual group, consider ﬁrst
the group G over the closure F of the ﬁeld F. All maximal tori T of this
group are conjugate to each other and are necessarily split, i.e., we have an
isomorphism T(F) ≃(F
×). For example, in the case of GLn, all maximal
tori are conjugate to the subgroup of diagonal matrices. We associate to T(F)
two lattices: the weight lattice X∗(T) of homomorphisms T(F) →F
× and
the coweight lattice X∗(T) of homomorphisms F
× →T(F). They contain
the sets of roots ∆⊂X∗(T) and coroots ∆∨⊂X∗(T), respectively. The
quadruple (X∗(T), X∗(T), ∆, ∆∨) is called the root datum for G over F. The
root datum determines G up to an isomorphism deﬁned over F. The choice
of a Borel subgroup B(F) containing T(F) is equivalent to a choice of a basis
in ∆, namely, the set of simple roots ∆s, and the corresponding basis ∆∨
s in
∆∨.
Now, given γ ∈Gal(F/F), there is g ∈G(F) such that g(γ(T(F))g−1 =
T(F) and g(γ(B(F))g−1 = B(F). Then g gives rise to an automorphism of
the based root data (X∗(T), X∗(T), ∆s, ∆∨
s ). Thus, we obtain an action of
Gal(F/F) on the based root data.
Let us now exchange the lattices of weights and coweights and the sets of
simple roots and coroots. Then we obtain the based root data
(X∗(T), X∗(T), ∆∨
s , ∆s)
of a reductive algebraic group over C which is denoted by LG◦. For instance,
the group GLn is self-dual, the dual of SO2n+1 is Sp2n, the dual of Sp2n is
SO2n+1, and SO2n is self-dual.
The action of Gal(F/F) on the based root data gives rise to its action on
LG◦. The semi-direct product LG = Gal(F/F)⋉LG◦is called the Langlands
dual group of G.

64
E. Frenkel
According to the local Langlands conjecture, the equivalence classes of
irreducible smooth representations of G(F) are, roughly speaking, parame-
terized by the equivalence classes of admissible homomorphisms W ′
F →LG.
In fact, the conjecture is more subtle: one needs to consider simultaneously
representations of all inner forms of G, and a homomorphism W ′
F →LG cor-
responds in general not to a single irreducible representation of G(F), but
to a ﬁnite set of representations called an L-packet. To distinguish between
them, one needs additional data (see [Vog] and Section 8.1 below for more
details). But in the ﬁrst approximation one can say that the essence of the
local Langlands correspondence is that
Irreducible smooth representations of G(F) are parameterized in terms of ad-
missible homomorphisms W ′
F →LG.
3 Geometric Local Langlands Correspondence over C
We now wish to ﬁnd a generalization of the local Langlands conjectures in
which we replace the ﬁeld F = Fq((t)) by the ﬁeld C((t)). We would like to
see how the ideas and patterns of the Langlands correspondence play out in
this new context, with the hope of better understanding the deep underlying
structures behind this correspondence.
So let G be a connected simply-connected algebraic group over C, and
G(F) the loop group G((t)) = G(C((t))). Thus, we wish to study smooth
representations of the loop group G((t)) and try to relate them to some
“Langlands parameters”, which we expect, by analogy with the case of local
non-archimedian ﬁelds described above, to be related to the Galois group of
C((t)) and the Langlands dual group LG.
3.1 Geometric Langlands Parameters
Unfortunately, the Galois group of C((t)) is too small: it is isomorphic to the
pro-ﬁnite completion Z of Z. This is not surprising from the point of view of
the analogy between the Galois groups and the fundamental groups (see, e.g.,
[F6], Sect. 3.1). The topological fundamental group of the punctured disc is
Z, and the algebraic fundamental group is its pro-ﬁnite completion.
However, we may introduce additional Langlands parameters by using a
more geometric perspective on homomorphisms from the fundamental group
to LG. Those may be viewed as LG-local systems. In general, LG-local systems
on a compact variety Z are the same as ﬂat LG-bundles (F, ∇) on Z. If the
variety is not compact (as in the case of D×), then we should impose the
additional condition that the connection has regular singularities (pole of
order at most 1) at inﬁnity. In our case we obtain LG-bundles on D× with
a connection that has regular singularity at the origin. Then the monodromy
of the connection gives rise to a homomorphism from π1(D×) to LG. Now we

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
65
generalize this by allowing connections with arbitrary, that is regular and
irregular, singularities at the origin. Thus, we want to use as the general
Langlands parameters, the equivalence classes of pairs (F, ∇), where F is a
LG-bundle on D× and ∇is an arbitrary connection on F.
Any bundle F on D× may be trivialized. Then ∇may be represented by
the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator
(3.1)
∇= ∂t + A(t),
A(t) ∈Lg((t)).
where Lg is the Lie algebra of the Langlands dual group LG. Changing the
trivialization of F amounts to a gauge transformation
∇→∇′ = ∂t + gAg−1 −(∂tg)g−1
with g ∈LG((t)). Therefore the set of equivalence classes of LG-bundles with
a connection on D× is in bijection with the set of gauge equivalence classes
of operators (3.1). We denote this set by LocLG(D×). Thus, we have
(3.2)
LocLG(D×) = {∂t + A(t), A(t) ∈Lg((t))}/LG((t)).
We declare that the local Langlands parameters in the complex setting
should be the points of LocLG(D×): the equivalence classes of ﬂat LG-bundles
on D× or, more concretely, the gauge equivalence classes (3.2) of ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operators.
Having settled the issue of the Langlands parameters, we have to decide
what it is that we will be parameterizing. Recall that in the classical setting the
homomorphism W ′
F →LG parameterized irreducible smooth representations
of the group G(F), F = Fq((t)). We start by translating this notion to the
representation theory of loop groups.
3.2 Representations of the Loop Group
The loop group G((t)) contains the congruence subgroups
(3.3)
KN = {g ∈G[[t]] | g ≡1 mod tN},
N ∈Z+.
It is natural to call a representation of G((t)) on a complex vector space V
smooth if for any vector v ∈V there exists N ∈Z+ such that KN · v = v.
This condition may be interpreted as the continuity condition, if we deﬁne a
topology on G((t)) by taking as the base of open neighborhoods of the identity
the subgroups KN, N ∈Z+, as before.
But our group G is now a complex Lie group (not a ﬁnite group), and
so G((t)) is an inﬁnite-dimensional Lie group. More precisely, we view G((t))
as an ind-group, i.e., as a group object in the category of ind-schemes. At
ﬁrst glance, it is natural to consider the algebraic representations of G((t)).
We observe that G((t)) is generated by the “parahoric” algebraic groups Pi

66
E. Frenkel
corresponding to the aﬃne simple roots. For these subgroups the notion of
algebraic representation makes perfect sense. A representation of G((t)) is then
said to be algebraic if its restriction to each of the Pi’s is algebraic.
However, this naive approach leads us to the following discouraging fact:
an irreducible smooth representation of G((t)), which is algebraic, is neces-
sarily trivial (see [BD1], 3.7.11(ii)). Thus, we ﬁnd that the class of algebraic
representations of loop groups turns out to be too restrictive. We could relax
this condition and consider diﬀerentiable representations, i.e., the representa-
tions of G((t)) considered as a Lie group. But it is easy to see that the result
would be the same. Replacing G((t)) by its central extension G would not help
us much either: irreducible integrable representations of G are parameterized
by dominant integral weights, and there are no extensions between them [K2].
These representations are again too sparse to be parameterized by the geo-
metric data considered above. Therefore we should look for other types of
representations.
Going back to the original setup of the local Langlands correspondence,
we recall that there we considered representations of G(Fq((t))) on C-vector
spaces, so we could not possibly use the algebraic structure of G(Fq((t))) as an
ind-group over Fq. Therefore we cannot expect the class of algebraic (or dif-
ferentiable) representations of the complex loop group G((t)) to be meaningful
from the point of view of the Langlands correspondence. We should view the
loop group G((t)) as an abstract topological group, with the topology deﬁned
by means of the congruence subgroups, in other words, consider its smooth
representations as an abstract group.
So we need to search for some geometric objects that encapsulate repre-
sentations of our groups and make sense both over a ﬁnite ﬁeld and over the
complex ﬁeld.
3.3 From Functions to Sheaves
We start by revisiting smooth representations of the group G(F), where
F = Fq((t)). We realize such representations more concretely by considering
their matrix coeﬃcients. Let (V, π) be an irreducible smooth representation of
G(F). We deﬁne the contragredient representation V ∨as the linear span of
all smooth vectors in the dual representation V ∗. This span is stable under the
action of G(F) and so it admits a smooth representation (V ∨, π∨) of G(F).
Now let φ be a KN-invariant vector in V ∨. Then we deﬁne a linear map
V →C(G(F)/KN),
v →fv,
where
fv(g) = ⟨π∨(g)φ, v⟩.
Here C(G(F)/KN) denotes the vector space of C-valued locally constant func-
tions on G(F)/KN. The group G(F) naturally acts on this space by the

67
formula (g · f)(h) = f(g−1h), and the above map is a morphism of represen-
tations, which is non-zero, and hence injective, if (V, π) is irreducible.
Thus, we realize our representation in the space of functions on the quo-
tient G(F)/KN. More generally, we may realize representations in spaces of
functions on the quotient G((t))/K with values in a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space, by considering a ﬁnite-dimensional subrepresentation of K inside V
rather than the trivial one.
An important observation here is that G(F)/K, where F = Fq((t))) and K
is a compact subgroup of G(F), is not only a set, but it is a set of points of an
algebraic variety (more precisely, an ind-scheme) deﬁned over the ﬁeld Fq. For
example, for K0 = G(Fq[[t]]), which is the maximal compact subgroup, the
quotient G(F)/K0 is the set of Fq-points of the ind-scheme called the aﬃne
Grassmannian.
Next, we recall an important idea going back to Grothendieck that func-
tions on the set of Fq-points on an algebraic variety X deﬁned over Fq can
often be viewed as the “shadows” of the so-called ℓ-adic sheaves on X. We
will not give the deﬁnition of these sheaves, referring the reader to [Mi, FK].
The Grothendieck fonctions-faisceaux dictionary (see, e.g., [La]) is formu-
lated as follows. Let F be an ℓ-adic sheaf and x be an Fq1-point of X, where
q1 = qm. Then one has the Frobenius conjugacy class Frx acting on the stalk
Fx of F at x. Hence we can deﬁne a function fq1(F) on the set of Fq1-points of
V , whose value at x is Tr(Frx, Fx). This function takes values in the algebraic
closure Qℓof Qℓ. But there is not much of a diﬀerence between Qℓ-valued
functions and C-valued functions: since they have the same cardinality, Qℓ
and C may be identiﬁed as abstract ﬁelds. Besides, in most interesting cases,
the values actually belong to Q, which is inside both Qℓand C.
More generally, if K is a complex of ℓ-adic sheaves, one deﬁnes a function
fq1(K) on V (Fq1) by taking the alternating sums of the traces of Frx on the
stalk cohomologies of K at x. The map K →fq1(K) intertwines the natural
operations on sheaves with natural operations on functions (see [La], Sect.
1.2).
Let K0(ShX) be the complexiﬁed Grothendieck group of the category of
ℓ-adic sheaves on X. Then the above construction gives us a map
K0(ShX) →

m≥1
X(Fqm),
and it is known that this map is injective (see [La]).
Therefore we may hope that the functions on the quotients G(F)/KN
which realize our representations come by this constructions from ℓ-adic
sheaves, or more generally, from complexes of ℓ-adic sheaves, on X.
Now, the notion of constructible sheaf (unlike the notion of a function)
has a transparent and meaningful analogue for a complex algebraic variety X,
namely, those sheaves of C-vector spaces whose restrictions to the strata of a
stratiﬁcation of the variety X are locally constant. The aﬃne Grassmannian

68
E. Frenkel
and more general ind-schemes underlying the quotients G(F)/KN may be
deﬁned both over Fq and C. Thus, it is natural to consider the categories of
such sheaves (or, more precisely, their derived categories) on these ind-schemes
over C as the replacements for the vector spaces of functions on their points
realizing smooth representations of the group G(F).
We therefore naturally come to the idea, advanced in [FG2], that the
representations of the loop group G((t)) that we need to consider are not
realized on vector spaces, but on categories, such as the derived category
of coherent sheaves on the aﬃne Grassmannian. Of course, such a category
has a Grothendieck group, and the group G((t)) will act on the Grothendieck
group as well, giving us a representation of G((t)) on a vector space. But we
obtain much more structure by looking at the categorical representation. The
objects of the category, as well as the action, will have a geometric meaning,
and thus we will be using the geometry as much as possible.
Let us summarize: to each local Langlands parameter χ ∈LocLG(D×) we
wish to attach a category Cχ equipped with an action of the loop group G((t)).
But what kind of categories should these Cχ be and what properties do we
expect them to satisfy?
To get closer to answering these questions, we wish to discuss two more
steps that we can make in the above discussion to get to the types of categories
with an action of the loop group that we will consider in this paper.
3.4 A Toy Model
At this point it is instructive to detour slightly and consider a toy model of
our construction. Let G be a split reductive group over Z, and B its Borel
subgroup. A natural representation of G(Fq) is realized in the space of complex
(or Qℓ-) valued functions on the quotient G(Fq)/B(Fq). It is natural to ask
what is the “correct” analogue of this representation if we replace the ﬁeld Fq
by the complex ﬁeld and the group G(Fq) by G(C). This may be viewed as a
simpliﬁed version of our quandary, since instead of considering G(Fq((t))) we
now look at G(Fq).
The quotient G(Fq)/B(Fq) is the set of Fq-points of the algebraic variety
deﬁned over Z called the ﬂag variety of G and deﬁned by Fl. Our discussion
in the previous section suggests that we ﬁrst need to replace the notion of
a function on Fl(Fq) by the notion of an ℓ-adic sheaf on the variety FlFq =
Fl ⊗
Z Fq.
Next, we replace the notion of an ℓ-adic sheaf on Fl considered as an
algebraic variety over Fq, by the notion of a constructible sheaf on FlC =
Fl ⊗
Z C which is an algebraic variety over C. The complex algebraic group GC
naturally acts on FlC and hence on this category. Now we make two more
reformulations of this category.
First of all, for a smooth complex algebraic variety X we have a Riemann-
Hilbert correspondence which is an equivalence between the derived

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
69
category of constructible sheaves on X and the derived category of D-modules
on X that are holonomic and have regular singularities.
Here we consider the sheaf of algebraic diﬀerential operators on X and
sheaves of modules over it, which we simply refer to as D-modules. The sim-
plest example of a D-module is the sheaf of sections of a vector bundle on V
equipped with a ﬂat connection. The ﬂat connection enables us to multiply
any section by a function and we can use the ﬂat connection to act on sections
by vector ﬁelds. The two actions generate an action of the sheaf of diﬀerential
operators on the sections of our bundle. The sheaf of horizontal sections of this
bundle is then a locally constant sheaf of X. We have seen above that there is a
bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of rank n bundles on X with
connection having regular singularities and the set of isomorphism classes of
locally constant sheaves on X of rank n, or equivalently, n-dimensional repre-
sentations of π1(X). This bijection may be elevated to an equivalence of the
corresponding categories, and the general Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
is a generalization of this equivalence of categories that encompasses more
general D-modules.
The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence allows us to associate to any holo-
nomic D-module on X a complex of constructible sheaves on X, and this gives
us a functor between the corresponding derived categories which turns out to
be an equivalence if we restrict ourselves to the holonomic D-modules with
regular singularities (see [B2, GM] for more details).
Thus, over C we may pass from constructible sheaves to D-modules. In
our case, we consider the category of (regular holonomic) D-modules on the
ﬂag variety FlC. This category carries a natural action of GC.
Finally, let us observe that the Lie algebra g of GC acts on the ﬂag va-
riety inﬁnitesimally by vector ﬁelds. Therefore, given a D-module F on FlC,
the space of its global sections Γ(FlC, F) has the structure of g-module. We
obtain a functor Γ from the category of D-modules on FlC to the category of
g-modules. A. Beilinson and J. Bernstein have proved that this functor is an
equivalence between the category of all D-modules on FlC (not necessarily reg-
ular holonomic) and the category C0 of g-modules on which the center of the
universal enveloping algebra U(g) acts through the augmentation character.
Thus, we can now answer our question as to what is a meaningful geomet-
ric analogue of the representation of the ﬁnite group G(Fq) on the space of
functions on the quotient G(Fq)/B(Fq). The answer is the following: it is an
abelian category equipped with an action of the algebraic group GC. This
category has two incarnations: one is the category of D-modules on the ﬂag
variety FlC, and the other is the category C0 of modules over the Lie algebra g
with the trivial central character. Both categories are equipped with natural
actions of the group GC.
Let us pause for a moment and spell out what exactly we mean when
we say that the group GC acts on the category C0. For simplicity, we will

70
E. Frenkel
describe the action of the corresponding group G(C) of C-points of GC.6 This
means the following: each element g ∈G gives rise to a functor Fg on C0
such that F1 is the identity functor, and the functor Fg−1 is quasi-inverse to
Fg. Moreover, for any pair g, h ∈G we have a ﬁxed isomorphism of functors
ig,h : Fgh →Fg ◦Fh so that for any triple g, h, k ∈G we have the equality
ih,kig,hk = ig,high,k of isomorphisms Fghk →Fg ◦Fh ◦Fk.
The functors Fg are deﬁned as follows. Given a representation (V, π) of g
and an element g ∈G(C), we deﬁne a new representation Fg((V, π)) = (V, πg),
where by deﬁnition πg(x) = π(Adg(x)). Suppose that (V, π) is irreducible.
Then it is easy to see that (V, πg) ≃(V, π) if and only if (V, π) is integrable,
i.e., is obtained from an algebraic representation of G.7 This is equivalent
to this representation being ﬁnite-dimensional. But a general representation
(V, π) is inﬁnite-dimensional, and so it will not be isomorphic to (V, πg), at
least for some g ∈G.
Now we consider morphisms in C0, which are just g-homomorphisms. Given
a g-homomorphism between representations (V, π) and (V ′, π′), i.e., a linear
map T : V →V ′ such that Tπ(x) = π′(x)T for all x ∈g, we set Fg(T) = T.
The isomorphisms ig,h are all identical in this case.
3.5 Back to Loop Groups
In our quest for a complex analogue of the local Langlands correspondence we
need to decide what will replace the notion of a smooth representation of the
group G(F), where F = Fq((t)). As the previous discussion demonstrates, we
should consider representations of the complex loop group G((t)) on various
categories of D-modules on the ind-schemes G((t))/K, where K is a “com-
pact” subgroup of G((t)), such as G[[t]] or the Iwahori subgroup (the preimage
of a Borel subgroup B ⊂G under the homomorphism G[[t]] →G), or the
categories of representations of the Lie algebra g((t)). Both scenarios are vi-
able, and they lead to interesting results and conjectures which we will discuss
in detail in Section 9, following [FG2]. In this paper we will concentrate on
the second scenario and consider categories of modules over the loop algebra
g((t)).
The group G((t)) acts on the category of representations of g((t)) in the way
that we described in the previous section. An analogue of a smooth represen-
tation of G(F) is a category of smooth representations of g((t)). Let us observe
however that we could choose instead the category of smooth representations
of the central extension of g((t)), namely, gκ.
6 More generally, for any C-algebra R, we have an action of G(R) on the corre-
sponding base-changed category over R. Thus, we are naturally led to the notion
of an algebraic group (or, more generally, a group scheme) acting on an abelian
category, which is spelled out in [FG2], Sect. 20.
7 In general, we could obtain a representation of a central extension of G, but if G
is reductive, it does not have non-trivial central extensions.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
71
The group G((t)) acts on the Lie algebra gκ for any κ, because the adjoint
action of the central extension of G((t)) factors through the action of G((t)). We
use the action of G((t)) on gκ to construct an action of G((t)) on the category
gκ -mod, in the same way as in Section 3.4.
Now recall the space LocLG(D×) of the Langlands parameters that we
deﬁned in Section 3.1. Elements of LocLG(D×) have a concrete description
as gauge equivalence classes of ﬁrst order operators ∂t + A(t), A(t) ∈Lg((t)),
modulo the action of LG((t)) (see formula (3.2)).
We can now formulate the local Langlands correspondence over C as the
following problem:
To each local Langlands parameter χ ∈LocLG(D×) associate a subcategory
gκ -modχ of gκ -mod which is stable under the action of the loop group G((t)).
We wish to think of the category gκ -mod as “ﬁbering” over the space of
local Langlands parameters LocLG(D×), with the categories gκ -modχ being
the “ﬁbers” and the group G((t)) acting along these ﬁbers. From this point
of view the categories gκ -modχ should give us a “spectral decomposition” of
the category gκ -mod over LocLG(D×).
In the next sections we will present a concrete proposal made in [FG2]
describing these categories in the special case when κ = κc, the critical level.
4 Center and Opers
In Section 1 we have introduced the category gκ -mod whose objects are
smooth gκ-modules on which the central element 1 acts as the identity. As
explained at the end of the previous section, we wish to show that this cat-
egory “ﬁbers” over the space of the Langlands parameters, which are gauge
equivalence classes of LG-connections on the punctured disc D× (or perhaps,
something similar). Moreover, the loop group G((t)) should act on this cate-
gory “along the ﬁbers”.
Any abelian category may be thought of as “ﬁbering” over the spectrum of
its center. Hence the ﬁrst idea that comes to mind is to describe the center of
the category gκ -mod in the hope that its spectrum is related to the Langlands
parameters. As we will see, this is indeed the case for a particular value of κ.
4.1 Center of an Abelian Category
Let us ﬁrst recall what is the center of an abelian category. Let C be an abelian
category over C. The center Z(C) is by deﬁnition the set of endomorphisms
of the identity functor on C. Let us recall such such an endomorphism is a
system of endomorphisms eM ∈HomC(M, M), for each object M of C, which
is compatible with the morphisms in C: for any morphism f : M →N in C
we have f ◦eM = eN ◦f. It is clear that Z(C) has a natural structure of a
commutative algebra over C.

72
E. Frenkel
Let S = Spec Z(C). This is an aﬃne algebraic variety such that Z(C) is the
algebra of functions on S. Each point s ∈S deﬁnes an algebra homomorphism
(equivalently, a character) ρs : Z(C) →C (evaluation of a function at the point
s). We deﬁne the full subcategory Cs of C whose objects are the objects of C
on which Z(C) acts according to the character ρs. It is instructive to think of
the category C as “ﬁbering” over S, with the ﬁbers being the categories Cs.
Now suppose that C = A -mod is the category of left modules over an
associative C-algebra A. Then A itself, considered as a left A-module, is an
object of C, and so we obtain a homomorphism
Z(C) →Z(EndA A) = Z(Aopp) = Z(A),
where Z(A) is the center of A. On the other hand, each element of Z(A)
deﬁnes an endomorphism of each object of A -mod, and so we obtain a ho-
momorphism Z(A) →Z(C). It is easy to see that these maps set mutually
inverse isomorphisms between Z(C) and Z(A).
If g is a Lie algebra, then the category g -mod of g-modules coincides
with the category U(g) -mod of U(g)-modules, where U(g) is the universal
enveloping algebra of g. Therefore the center of the category g -mod is equal
to the center of U(g), which by abuse of notation we denote by Z(g).
Now consider the category gκ -mod. Let us recall from Section 1 that ob-
jects of gκ -mod are gκ-modules M on which the central element 1 acts as the
identity and which are smooth, that is for any vector v ∈M we have
(4.1)
(g ⊗tNC[[t]]) · v = 0
for suﬃciently large N.
Thus, we see that there are two properties that its objects satisfy. There-
fore it does not coincide with the category of all modules over the universal
enveloping algebra U(gκ) (which is the category of all gκ-modules). We need
to modify this algebra.
First of all, since 1 acts as the identity, the action of U(gκ) factors through
the quotient
Uκ(g)
def
= Uκ(g)/(1 −1).
Second, the smoothness condition (4.1) implies that the action of Uκ(g) ex-
tends to an action of its completion deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁne a linear topology on Uκ(g) by using as the basis of neighborhoods
for 0 the following left ideals:
IN = Uκ(g)(g ⊗tNC[[t]]),
N ⩾0.
Let Uκ(g) be the completion of Uκ(g) with respect to this topology. Note that,
equivalently, we can write
Uκ(g) = lim
←−Uκ(g)/IN.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
73
Even though the IN’s are only left ideals (and not two-sided ideals), one checks
that the associative product structure on Uκ(g) extends by continuity to an
associative product structure on Uκ(g) (this follows from the fact that the
Lie bracket on Uκ(g) is continuous in the above topology). Thus, Uκ(g) is a
complete topological algebra. It follows from the deﬁnition that the category
gκ -mod coincides with the category of discrete modules over Uκ(g) on which
the action of Uκ(g) is pointwise continuous (this is precisely equivalent to the
condition (4.1)).
It is now easy to see that the center of our category gκ -mod is equal to
the center of the algebra Uκ(g), which we will denote by Zκ(g). The argument
is similar to the one we used above: though Uκ(g) itself is not an object of
gκ -mod, we have a collection of objects Uκ(g)/IN. Using this collection, we
obtain an isomorphism between the center of category gκ -mod and the inverse
limit of the algebras Z(Endgκ Uκ(g)/IN), which, by deﬁnition, coincides with
Zκ(g).
Now we can formulate our ﬁrst question:
describe the center Zκ(g) for all levels κ.
In order to answer this question we need to introduce the concept of G-
opers.
4.2 Opers
Let G be a simple algebraic group of adjoint type, B its Borel subgroup
and N = [B, B] its unipotent radical, with the corresponding Lie algebras
n ⊂b ⊂g.
Thus, g is a simple Lie algebra, and as such it has the Cartan decomposition
g = n−⊕h ⊕n+.
We will choose generators e1, . . . , eℓ(resp., f1, . . . , fℓ) of n+ (resp., n−). We
have nαi = Cei, n−αi = Cfi. We take b = h ⊕n+ as the Lie algebra of B.
Then n is the Lie algebra of N. In what follows we will use the notation n for
n+.
Let [n, n]⊥⊂g be the orthogonal complement of [n, n] with respect to a
non-degenerate invariant bilinear form κ0. We have
[n, n]⊥/b ≃
ℓ
$
i=1
n−αi.
Clearly, the group B acts on n⊥/b. Our ﬁrst observation is that there is an
open B-orbit O ⊂n⊥/b ⊂g/b, consisting of vectors whose projection on each
subspace n−αi is non-zero. This orbit may also be described as the B-orbit of

74
E. Frenkel
the sum of the projections of the generators fi, i = 1, . . . , ℓ, of any possible
subalgebra n−, onto g/b. The action of B on O factors through an action of
H = B/N. The latter is simply transitive and makes O into an H-torsor.
Let X be a smooth curve and x a point of X. As before, we denote by
Ox the completed local ring and by Kx its ﬁeld of fractions. The ring Ox
is isomorphic, but not canonically, to C[[t]]. Then Dx = Spec Ox is the disc
without a coordinate and D×
x = Spec Kx is the corresponding punctured disc.
Suppose now that we are given a principal G-bundle F on a smooth curve
X, or Dx, or D×
x , together with a connection ∇(automatically ﬂat) and
a reduction FB to the Borel subgroup B of G. Then we deﬁne the relative
position of ∇and FB (i.e., the failure of ∇to preserve FB) as follows. Locally,
choose any ﬂat connection ∇′ on F preserving FB, and take the diﬀerence
∇−∇′, which is a section of gFB ⊗ΩX. We project it onto (g/b)FB ⊗ΩX. It
is clear that the resulting local section of (g/b)FB ⊗ΩX are independent of
the choice ∇′. These sections patch together to deﬁne a global (g/b)FB-valued
one-form on X, denoted by ∇/FB.
Let X be a smooth curve, or Dx, or D×
x . Suppose we are given a principal
G-bundle F on X, a connection ∇on F and a B-reduction FB. We will say that
FB is transversal to ∇if the one-form ∇/FB takes values in OFB ⊂(g/b)FB.
Note that O is C×-invariant, so that O ⊗ΩX is a well-deﬁned subset of
(g/b)FB ⊗ΩX.
Now, a G-oper on X is by deﬁnition a triple (F, ∇, FB), where F is a
principal G-bundle F on X, ∇is a connection on F and FB is a B-reduction
of F, such that FB is transversal to ∇.
This deﬁnition is due to A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld [BD1] (in the case
when X is the punctured disc opers were introduced earlier by V. Drinfeld
and V. Sokolov in [DS]).
Equivalently, the transversality condition may be reformulated as saying
that if we choose a local trivialization of FB and a local coordinate t then the
connection will be of the form
(4.2)
∇= ∂t +
ℓ

i=1
ψi(t)fi + v(t),
where each ψi(t) is a nowhere vanishing function, and v(t) is a b-valued func-
tion.
If we change the trivialization of FB, then this operator will get trans-
formed by the corresponding B-valued gauge transformation. This observa-
tion allows us to describe opers on the disc Dx = Spec Ox and the punctured
disc D×
x = Spec Kx in a more explicit way. The same reasoning will work on
any suﬃciently small analytic subset U of any curve, equipped with a local
coordinate t, or on a Zariski open subset equipped with an ´etale coordinate.
For the sake of deﬁniteness, we will consider now the case of the base D×
x .
Let us choose a coordinate t on Dx, i.e., an isomorphism Ox ≃C[[t]].
Then we identify Dx with D = Spec C[[t]] and D×
x with D× = Spec C((t)).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
75
The space OpG(D×) of G-opers on D× is then the quotient of the space of all
operators of the form (4.2), where ψi(t) ∈C((t)), ψi(0) ̸= 0, i = 1, . . . , ℓ, and
v(t) ∈b((t)), by the action of the group B((t)) of gauge transformations:
g · (∂t + A(t)) = ∂t + gA(t)g−1 −g−1∂tg.
Let us choose a splitting ı : H →B of the homomorphism B →H. Then
B becomes the semi-direct product B = H⋉N. The B-orbit O is an H-torsor,
and so we can use H-valued gauge transformations to make all functions ψi(t)
equal to 1. In other words, there is a unique element of H((t)), namely, the
element %ℓ
i=1 ˇωi(ψi(t)), where ˇωi : C× →H is the ith fundamental coweight
of G, such that the corresponding gauge transformation brings our connection
operator to the form
(4.3)
∇= ∂t +
ℓ

i=1
fi + v(t),
v(t) ∈b((t)).
What remains is the group of N-valued gauge transformations. Thus, we ob-
tain that OpG(D×) is equal to the quotient of the space &
OpG(D×) of operators
of the form (4.3) by the action of the group N((t)) by gauge transformations:
OpG(D×) = &
OpG(D×)/N((t)).
Lemma 1 ([DS]). The action of N((t)) on &
OpG(D×) is free.
4.3 Canonical Representatives
Now we construct canonical representatives in the N((t))-gauge classes of con-
nections of the form (4.3), following [BD1]. Observe that the operator ad ˇρ
deﬁnes a gradation on g, called the principal gradation, with respect to
which we have a direct sum decomposition g = '
i gi. In particular, we have
b = '
i≥0 bi, where b0 = h.
Let now
p−1 =
ℓ

i=1
fi.
The operator ad p−1 acts from bi+1 to bi injectively for all i ≥0. Hence we
can ﬁnd for each i ≥0 a subspace Vi ⊂bi, such that bi = [p−1, bi+1]⊕Vi. It is
well-known that Vi ̸= 0 if and only if i is an exponent of g, and in that case
dim Vi is equal to the multiplicity of the exponent i. In particular, V0 = 0.
Let V = '
i∈E Vi ⊂n, where E = {d1, . . . , dℓ} is the set of exponents of
g counted with multiplicity. They are equal to the orders of the generators of
the center of U(g) minus one. We note that the multiplicity of each exponent
is equal to one in all cases except the case g = D2n, dn = 2n, when it is equal
to two.

76
E. Frenkel
There is a special choice of the transversal subspace V = '
i∈E Vi. Namely,
there exists a unique element p1 in n, such that {p−1, 2ˇρ, p1} is an sl2-triple.
This means that they have the same relations as the generators {e, h, f} of
sl2. We have p1 = ℓ
i=1 miei, where ei’s are generators of n+ and mi are
certain coeﬃcients uniquely determined by the condition that {p−1, 2ˇρ, p1} is
an sl2-triple.
Let V can = '
i∈E V can
i
be the space of ad p1-invariants in n. Then p1 spans
V can
1
. Let pj be a linear generator of V can
dj . If the multiplicity of dj is greater
than one, then we choose linearly independent vectors in V can
dj .
Each N((t))-equivalence class contains a unique operator of the form ∇=
∂t + p−1 + v(t), where v(t) ∈V can[[t]], so that we can write
v(t) =
ℓ

j=1
vj(t) · pj,
vj(t) ∈C[[t]].
It is easy to ﬁnd (see, e.g., [F6], Sect. 8.3) that under changes of coordinate
t, v1 transforms as a projective connection, and vj, j > 1, transforms as a
(dj + 1)-diﬀerential on Dx. Thus, we obtain an isomorphism
(4.4)
OpG(D×) ≃Proj(D×) ×
ℓ
$
j=2
Ω⊗(dj+1)
K
,
where Ω⊗n
K
is the space of n-diﬀerentials on D× and Proj(D×) is the Ω⊗2
K -
torsor of projective connections on D×.
We have an analogous isomorphism with D× replaced by formal disc D or
any smooth algebraic curve X.
4.4 Description of the Center
Now we are ready to describe the center of the completed universal enveloping
algebra Uκc(g). The following assertion is proved in [F7], using results of [K1]:
Proposition 1. The center of Uκ(g) consists of the scalars for κ ̸= κc.
Let us denote the center of Uκc(g) by Z(g). The following theorem was
proved in [FF3, F3] (it was conjectured by V. Drinfeld).
Theorem 2. The center Z(g) is isomorphic to the algebra Fun OpLG(D×) in
a way compatible with the action of the group of coordinate changes.
This implies the following result. Let x be a point of a smooth curve
X. Then we have the aﬃne algebra gκc,x as deﬁned in Section 1 and the

denote its center by Z(gx).

5 Opers vs. Local Systems
We now go back to the question posed at the end of Section 3: let
(5.1)
LocLG(D×) =
(
∂t + A(t), A(t) ∈Lg((t))
)
/ LG((t))
be the set of gauge equivalence classes of LG-connections on the punctured
disc D× = Spec C((t)). We had argued in Section 3 that LocLG(D×) should
be taken as the space of Langlands parameters for the loop group G((t)).
Recall that the loop group G((t)) acts on the category gκ -mod of (smooth)
g-modules of level κ (see Section 1 for the deﬁnition of this category). We
asked the following question:
Associate to each local Langlands parameter σ ∈LocLG(D×) a subcategory
gκ -modσ of gκ -mod which is stable under the action of the loop group G((t)).
Even more ambitiously, we wish to represent the category gκ -mod as
“ﬁbering” over the space of local Langlands parameters LocLG(D×), with
the categories gκ -modσ being the “ﬁbers” and the group G((t)) acting along
these ﬁbers. If we could do that, then we would think of this ﬁbration as a
“spectral decomposition” of the category gκ -mod over LocLG(D×).
At the beginning of Section 4 we proposed a possible scenario for solving
this problem. Namely, we observed that any abelian category may be thought
of as “ﬁbering” over the spectrum of its center. Hence our idea was to describe
the center of the category gκ -mod (for each value of κ) and see if its spectrum
is related to the space LocLG(D×) of Langlands parameters.
We have identiﬁed the center of the category gκ -mod with the center Zκ(g)
of the associative algebra Uκ(g), the completed enveloping algebra of g of level
κ, deﬁned in Section 4. Next, we described the algebra Zκ(g). According to
Proposition 1, if κ ̸= κc, the critical level, then Zκ(g) = C. Therefore our
approach cannot work for κ ̸= κc. However, we found that the center Zκc(g)
at the critical level is highly non-trivial and indeed related to LG-connections
on the punctured disc.
Now, following the works [FG1]–[FG6] of D. Gaitsgory and myself, I will
use these results to formulate more precise conjectures on the local Langlands
correspondence for loop groups and to provide some evidence for these con-
jectures. I will then discuss the implications of these conjectures for the global
geometric Langlands correspondence.8
According to Theorem 2, Zκc(g) is isomorphic to Fun OpLG(D×), the al-
gebra of functions on the space of LG-opers on the punctured disc D×. This
isomorphism is compatible with various symmetries and structures on both
8 Note that A. Beilinson has another proposal [Bei] for local geometric Langlands
correspondence, using representations of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras of levels less
than critical. It would be interesting to understand the connection between his
proposal and ours.

algebras, such as the action of the group of coordinate changes. There is a one-
to-one correspondence between points χ ∈OpLG(D×) and homomorphisms
(equivalently, characters)
Fun OpLG(D×) →C,
corresponding to evaluating a function at χ. Hence points of OpLG(D×) para-
metrize central characters Zκc(g) →C.
Given a LG-oper χ ∈OpLG(D×), deﬁne the category
gκc -modχ
as a full subcategory of gκc -mod whose objects are g-modules of critical level
(hence Uκc(g)-modules) on which the center Zκc(g) ⊂Uκc(g) acts according
to the central character corresponding to χ. More generally, for any closed
algebraic subvariety Y ⊂OpLG(D×) (not necessarily a point), we have an
ideal
IY ⊂Fun OpLG(D×) ≃Zκc(g)
of those functions that vanish on Y . We then have a full subcategory
gκc -modY of gκc -mod whose objects are g-modules of critical level on which
IY acts by 0. This category is an example of a “base change” of the category
gκc -mod with respect to the morphism Y →OpLG(D×). It is easy to general-
ize this deﬁnition to an arbitrary aﬃne scheme Y equipped with a morphism
Y →OpLG(D×).9
Since the algebra OpLG(D×) acts on the category gκc -mod, one can say
that the category gκ -mod “ﬁbers” over the space OpLG(D×), in such a way
that the ﬁber-category corresponding to χ ∈OpLG(D×) is the category
gκc -modχ.10
Recall that the group G((t)) acts on Uκc(g) and on the category gκc -mod.
One can show (see [BD1], Remark 3.7.11(iii)) that the action of G((t)) on
Zκc(g) ⊂Uκc(g) is trivial. Therefore the subcategories gκc -modχ (and, more
generally, gκc -modY ) are stable under the action of G((t)). Thus, the group
G((t)) acts “along the ﬁbers” of the “ﬁbration” gκc -mod →OpLG(D×) (see
[FG2], Sect. 20, for more details).
The ﬁbration gκc -mod →OpLG(D×) almost gives us the desired local
Langlands correspondence for loop groups. But there is one important diﬀer-
ence: we asked that the category gκc -mod ﬁber over the space LocLG(D×) of
local systems on D×. We have shown, however, that gκc -mod ﬁbers over the
space OpLG(D×) of LG-opers.
9 The corresponding base changed categories gκc -modY may then be “glued” to-
gether, which allows us to deﬁne the base changed category gκc -modY for any
scheme Y mapping to OpLG(D×).
10 The precise notion of an abelian category ﬁbering over a scheme is spelled out in
[Ga3].

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program

What is the diﬀerence between the two spaces? While a LG-local system is
a pair (F, ∇), where F is an LG-bundle and ∇is a connection on F, an LG-oper
is a triple (F, ∇, FLB), where F and ∇are as before, and FLB is an additional
piece of structure, namely, a reduction of F to a (ﬁxed) Borel subgroup LB ⊂
LG satisfying the transversality condition explained in Section 4.2. Thus, for
any curve X we clearly have a forgetful map
OpLG(X) →LocLG(X).
The ﬁber of this map over (F, ∇) ∈LocLG(X) consists of all LB-reductions
of F satisfying the transversality condition with respect to ∇.
For a general X it may well be that this map is not surjective, i.e., that the
ﬁber of this map over a particular local system (F, ∇) is empty. For example,
if X is a projective curve and LG is a group of adjoint type, then there is a
unique LG-bundle FLG such that the ﬁber over (FLG, ∇) is non-empty, as we
saw in Section 1.
The situation is quite diﬀerent when X = D×. In this case any LG-bundle
F may be trivialized. A connection ∇therefore may be represented as a ﬁrst
order operator ∂t + A(t), A(t) ∈Lg((t)). However, the trivialization of F is not
unique; two trivializations diﬀer by an element of LG((t)). Therefore the set
of equivalence classes of pairs (F, ∇) is identiﬁed with the quotient (5.1).
Suppose now that (F, ∇) carries an oper reduction FLB. Then we consider
only those trivializations of F which come from trivializations of FLB. There
are fewer of those, since two trivializations now diﬀer by an element of LB((t))
rather than LG((t)). Due to the oper transversality condition, the connection ∇
must have a special form with respect to any of those trivializations, namely,
∇= ∂t +
ℓ

i=1
ψi(t)fi + v(t),
where each ψi(t) ̸= 0 and v(t) ∈Lb((t)) (see Section 4.2). Thus, we obtain
a concrete realization of the space of opers as a space of gauge equivalence
classes
(5.2)
OpLG(D×) =
*
∂t +
ℓ

i=1
ψi(t)fi + v(t), ψi ̸= 0, v(t) ∈Lb((t))
+,
LB((t)).
Now the map
α : OpLG(D×) →LocLG(D×)
simply takes a LB((t))-equivalence class of operators of the form (5.2) to its
LG((t))-equivalence class.
Unlike the case of projective curves X discussed above, we expect that the
map α is surjective for any simple Lie group LG. In the case of G = SLn
this follows from the results of P. Deligne [De1], and we conjecture it to be
true in general.

80
E. Frenkel
Conjecture 1. The map α is surjective for any simple Lie group LG.
Now we ﬁnd ourselves in the following situation: we expect that there exists
a category C ﬁbering over the space LocLG(D×) of “true” local Langlands
parameters, equipped with a ﬁberwise action of the loop group G((t)). The
ﬁber categories Cσ corresponding to various σ ∈LocLG(D×) should satisfy
various, not yet speciﬁed, properties. This should be the ultimate form of the
local Langlands correspondence. On the other hand, we have constructed a
category gκc -mod which ﬁbers over a close cousin of the space LocLG(D×),
namely, the space OpLG(D×) of LG-opers, and is equipped with a ﬁberwise
action of the loop group G((t)).
What should be the relationship between the two?
The idea of [FG2] is that the second ﬁbration is a “base change” of the
ﬁrst one, that is we have a Cartesian diagram

that commutes with the action of G((t)) along the ﬁbers of the two vertical
maps. In other words,
gκc -mod ≃C
×
LocLG(D×) OpLG(D×).
At present, we do not have a deﬁnition of C, and therefore we cannot make
this isomorphism precise. But we will use it as our guiding principle. We will
now discuss various corollaries of this conjecture and various pieces of evidence
that make us believe that it is true.
In particular, let us ﬁx a Langlands parameter σ ∈LocLG(D×) that is in
the image of the map α (according to Conjecture 1, all Langlands parameters
are). Let χ be a LG-oper in the preimage of σ, α−1(σ). Then, according to
the above conjecture, the category gκc -modχ is equivalent to the “would be”
Langlands category Cσ attached to σ. Hence we may take gκc -modχ as the
deﬁnition of Cσ.
The caveat is, of course, that we need to ensure that this deﬁnition is inde-
pendent of the choice of χ in α−1(σ). This means that for any two LG-opers,
χ and χ′, in the preimage of σ, the corresponding categories, gκc -modχ and
gκc -modχ′, should be equivalent to each other, and this equivalence should
commute with the action of the loop group G((t)). Moreover, we should ex-
pect that these equivalences are compatible with each other as we move along
the ﬁber α−1(σ). We will not try to make this condition more precise here
(however, we will explain below in Conjecture 4 what this means for regular
opers).
Even putting the questions of compatibility aside, we arrive at the follow-
ing rather non-trivial conjecture (see [FG2]).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program

Conjecture 2. Suppose that χ, χ′ ∈OpLG(D×) are such that α(χ) = α(χ′),
i.e., that the ﬂat LG-bundles on D× underlying the LG-opers χ and χ′ are
isomorphic to each other. Then there is an equivalence between the categories
gκc -modχ and gκc -modχ′ which commutes with the actions of the group G((t))
on the two categories.
Thus, motivated by our quest for the local Langlands correspondence, we
have found an unexpected symmetry in the structure of the category gκc -mod
of g-modules of critical level.
6 Harish–Chandra Categories
As explained in Section 3, the local Langlands correspondence for the loop
group G((t)) should be viewed as a categoriﬁcation of the local Langlands cor-
respondence for the group G(F), where F is a local non-archimedian ﬁeld.
This means that the categories Cσ, equipped with an action of G((t)), that
we are trying to attach to the Langlands parameters σ ∈LocLG(D×) should
be viewed as categoriﬁcations of the smooth representations of G(F) on com-
plex vector spaces attached to the corresponding local Langlands parameters
discussed in Section 2.3. Here we use the term “categoriﬁcation” to indicate
that we expect the Grothendieck groups of the categories Cσ to “look like”
irreducible smooth representations of G(F). We begin by taking a closer look
at the structure of these representations.
6.1 Spaces of K-Invariant Vectors
It is known that an irreducible smooth representation (R, π) of G(F) is auto-
matically admissible, in the sense that for any open compact subgroup K,
such as the Nth congruence subgroup KN deﬁned in Section 2.1, the space
Rπ(K) of K-invariant vectors in R is ﬁnite-dimensional. Thus, while most of
the irreducible smooth representations (R, π) of G(F) are inﬁnite-dimensional,
they are ﬁltered by the ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces Rπ(K) of K-invariant vec-
tors, where K are smaller and smaller open compact subgroups. The space
Rπ(K) does not carry an action of G(F), but it carries an action of the Hecke
algebra H(G(F), K).
By deﬁnition, H(G(F), K) is the space of compactly supported K bi-
invariant functions on G(F). It is given an algebra structure with respect to
the convolution product
(6.1)
(f1 ⋆f2)(g) =

G(F )
f1(gh−1)f2(h) dh,
where dh is the Haar measure on G(F) normalized in such a way that the
volume of the subgroup K0 = G(O) is equal to 1 (here O is the ring of integers

82
E. Frenkel
of F; e.g., for F = Fq((t)) we have O = Fq[[t]]). The algebra H(G(F), K) acts
on the space Rπ(K) by the formula
(6.2)
f ⋆v =

G(F )
f1(gh−1)(π(h) · v) dh,
v ∈Rπ(K).
Studying the spaces of K-invariant vectors and their H(G(F), K)-module
structure gives us an eﬀective tool for analyzing representations of the group
G(F), where F = Fq((t)).
Can we ﬁnd a similar structure in the categorical local Langlands corre-
spondence for loop groups?
6.2 Equivariant Modules
In the categorical setting a representation (R, π) of the group G(F) is re-
placed by a category equipped with an action of G((t)), such as gκc -modχ.
The open compact subgroups of G(F) have obvious analogues for the loop
group G((t)) (although they are, of course, not compact with respect to the
usual topology on G((t))). For instance, we have the “maximal compact sub-
group” K0 = G[[t]], or, more generally, the Nth congruence subgroup KN,
whose elements are congruent to 1 modulo tNC[[t]]. Another important exam-
ple is the analogue of the Iwahori subgroup. This is the subgroup of G[[t]],
which we denote by I, whose elements g(t) have the property that their value
at 0, that is g(0), belong to a ﬁxed Borel subgroup B ⊂G.
Now, for a subgroup K ⊂G((t)) of this type, an analogue of a K-invariant
vector in the categorical setting is an object of our category, i.e., a smooth
gκc-module (M, ρ), where ρ : gκc →End M, which is stable under the action
of K. Recall from Section 3.5 that for any g ∈G((t)) we have a new gκc-
module (M, ρg), where ρg(x) = ρ(Adg(x)). We say that (M, ρ) is stable under
K, or that (M, ρ) is weakly K-equivariant, if there is a compatible system
of isomorphisms between (M, ρ) and (M, ρk) for all k ∈K. More precisely,
this means that for each k ∈K there exists a linear map T M
k
: M →M such
that
T M
k ρ(x)(T M
k )−1 = ρ(Adk(x))
for all x ∈gκc, and we have
T M
1
= IdM,
T M
k1 T M
k2 = T M
k1k2.
Thus, M becomes a representation of the group K.11 Consider the corre-
sponding representation of the Lie algebra k = Lie K on M. Let us assume
that the embedding k  →g((t)) lifts to k  →gκc (i.e., that the central extension
cocycle is trivial on k). This is true, for instance, for any subgroup contained
11 In general, it is reasonable to modify the last condition to allow for a non-trivial
two-cocycle and hence a non-trivial central extension of K; however, in the case
of interest K does not have any non-trivial central extensions.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
83
in K0 = G[[t]], or its conjugate. Then we also have a representation of k on
M obtained by restriction of ρ. In general, the two representations do not
have to coincide. If they do coincide, then the module M is called strongly
K-equivariant, or simply K-equivariant.
The pair (gκc, K) is an example of Harish-Chandra pair, that is a pair
(g, H) consisting of a Lie algebra g and a Lie group H whose Lie algebra is
contained in g. The K-equivariant gκc-modules are therefore called (gκc, K)
Harish-Chandra modules. These are (smooth) gκc-modules on which the
action of the Lie algebra Lie K ⊂gκc may be exponentiated to an action of K
(we will assume that K is connected). We denote by gκc -modK and gκc -modK
χ
the full subcategories of gκc -mod and gκc -modχ, respectively, whose objects
are (gκc, K) Harish-Chandra modules.
We will stipulate that the analogues of K-invariant vectors in the category
gκc -modχ are (gκc, K) Harish-Chandra modules. Thus, while the categories
gκc -modχ should be viewed as analogues of smooth irreducible representations
(R, π) of the group G(F), the categories gκc -modK
χ are analogues of the spaces
of K-invariant vectors Rπ(K).
Next, we discuss the categorical analogue of the Hecke algebra H(G(F), K).
6.3 Categorical Hecke Algebras
We recall that H(G(F), K) is the algebra of compactly supported K bi-
invariant functions on G(F). We realize it as the algebra of left K-invariant
compactly supported functions on G(F)/K. In Section 3.4 we have already
discussed the question of categoriﬁcation of the algebra of functions on a
homogeneous space like G(F)/K. Our conclusion was that the categorical
analogue of this algebra, when G(F) is replaced by the complex loop group
G((t)), is the category of D-modules on G((t))/K. More precisely, this quotient
has the structure of an ind-scheme which is a direct limit of ﬁnite-dimensional
algebraic varieties with respect to closed embeddings. The appropriate notion
of (right) D-modules on such ind-schemes is formulated in [BD1] (see also
[FG1, FG2]). As the categorical analogue of the algebra of left K-invariant
functions on G(F)/K, we take the category H(G((t)), K) of K-equivariant
D-modules on the ind-scheme G((t))/K (with respect to the left action of K
on G((t))/K). We call it the categorical Hecke algebra associated to K.
It is easy to deﬁne the convolution of two objects of H(G((t)), K) by im-
itating formula (6.1). Namely, we interpret this formula as a composition of
the operations of pulling back and integrating functions. Then we apply the
same operations to D-modules, thinking of the integral as push-forward. How-
ever, here one encounters two problems. The ﬁrst problem is that for a general
group K the morphisms involved will not be proper, and so we have to choose
between the ∗- and !-push-forward. This problem does not arise, however,
if K is such that I ⊂K ⊂G[[t]], which will be our main case of interest.
The second, and more serious, issue is that in general the push-forward is
not an exact functor, and so the convolution of two D-modules will not be

84
E. Frenkel
a D-module, but a complex, more precisely, an object of the corresponding
K-equivariant (bounded) derived category Db(G((t))/K)K of D-modules on
G((t))/K. We will not spell out the exact deﬁnition of this category here, re-
ferring the interested reader to [BD1] and [FG2]. The exception is the case of
the subgroup K0 = G[[t]], when the convolution functor is exact and so we
may restrict ourselves to the abelian category of K0-equivariant D-modules
on G((t))/K0.
Now the category Db(G((t))/K)K has a monoidal structure, and as such
it acts on the derived category of (gκc, K) Harish-Chandra modules (again,
we refer the reader to [BD1, FG2] for the precise deﬁnition). In the special
case when K = K0, we may restrict ourselves to the corresponding abelian
categories. This action should be viewed as the categorical analogue of the
action of H(G(F), K) on the space Rπ(K) of K-invariant vectors discussed
above.
Our ultimate goal is understanding the “local Langlands categories” Cσ
associated to the “local Langlands parameters σ ∈LocLG(D×). We now
have a candidate for the category Cσ, namely, the category gκc -modχ, where
σ = α(χ). Therefore gκc -modχ should be viewed as a categoriﬁcation of a
smooth representation (R, π) of G(F). The corresponding category gκc -modK
χ
of (gκc, K) Harish-Chandra modules should therefore be viewed as a categori-
ﬁcation of Rπ(K). This category (or, more precisely, its derived category) is
acted upon by the categorical Hecke algebra H(G((t)), K). We summarize this
analogy in the following table.

their structure to the structure of the spaces Rπ(K) of K-invariant vectors of
smooth representations of G(F) in the known cases. Another possibility is to
test Conjecture 2 when applied to the categories of Harish-Chandra modules.
In the next section we consider the case of the “maximal compact sub-
group” K0 = G[[t]] and ﬁnd perfect agreement with the classical results about
unramiﬁed representations of G(F). We then take up the more complicated
case of the Iwahori subgroup I. There we also ﬁnd the conjectures and re-
sults of [FG2] to be consistent with the known results about representations
of G(F) with Iwahori ﬁxed vectors.
7 Local Langlands Correspondence: Unramiﬁed Case
We ﬁrst take up the case of the “maximal compact subgroup” K0 = G[[t]]
of G((t)) and consider the categories gκc -modχ which contain non-trivial K0-
equivariant objects.
7.1 Unramiﬁed Representations of G(F )
These categories are analogues of smooth representations of the group G(F),
where F is a local non-archimedian ﬁeld (such as Fq((t))) that contain non-
zero K0-invariant vectors. Such representations are called unramiﬁed. The
classiﬁcation of the irreducible unramiﬁed representations of G(F) is the sim-
plest case of the local Langlands correspondence discussed in Sections 2.2 and
2.3. Namely, we have a bijection between the sets of equivalence classes of the
following objects:
(7.1)
unramiﬁed admissible
homomorphisms W ′
F →LG
⇐⇒
irreducible unramiﬁed
representations of G(F)
where W ′
F is the Weil-Deligne group introduced in Section 2.1.
By deﬁnition, unramiﬁed homomorphisms W ′
F −→LG are those which
factor through the quotient
W ′
F →WF →Z
(see Section 2.1 for the deﬁnitions of these groups and homomorphisms). It
is admissible if its image in LG consists of semi-simple elements. Therefore
the set on the left hand side of (7.1) is just the set of conjugacy classes of
semi-simple elements of LG. Thus, the above bijection may be reinterpreted
as follows:
(7.2)
semi-simple conjugacy
classes in LG
⇐⇒
irreducible unramiﬁed
representations of G(F)

86
E. Frenkel
To construct this bijection, we look at the Hecke algebra H(G(F), K0).
According to the Satake isomorphism [Sat], in the interpretation of Langlands
[L], this algebra is commutative and isomorphic to the representation ring of
the Langlands dual group LG:
(7.3)
H(G(F), K0) ≃Rep LG.
We recall that Rep LG consists of ﬁnite linear combinations 
i ai[Vi], where
the Vi are ﬁnite-dimensional representations of LG (without loss of generality
we may assume that they are irreducible) and ai ∈C, with respect to the
multiplication
[V ] · [W] = [V ⊗W].
Since Rep LG is commutative, its irreducible modules are all one-dimensional.
They correspond to characters Rep LG →C. We have a bijection
(7.4)
semi-simple conjugacy
classes in LG
⇐⇒
characters
of Rep LG
where the character φγ corresponding to the conjugacy class γ is given by the
formula12
φγ : [V ] →Tr(γ, V ).
Now, if (R, π) is a representation of G(F), then the space Rπ(K0) of K0-
invariant vectors in V is a module over H(G(F), K0). It is easy to show
that this sets up a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of
irreducible unramiﬁed representations of G(F) and irreducible H(G(F), K0)-
modules. Combining this with the bijection (7.4) and the isomorphism (7.3),
we obtain the sought-after bijections (7.1) and (7.2).
In particular, we ﬁnd that, because the Hecke algebra H(G(F), K0) is com-
mutative, the space Rπ(K0) of K0-invariants of an irreducible representation,
which is an irreducible H(G(F), K0)-module, is either zero or one-dimensional.
If it is one-dimensional, then H(G(F), K0) acts on it by the character φγ for
some γ:
(7.5)
HV ⋆v = Tr(γ, V )v,
v ∈Rπ(K0), [V ] ∈Rep LG,
where HV is the element of H(G(F), K0) corresponding to [V ] under the iso-
morphism (7.3) (see formula (6.2) for the deﬁnition of the convolution action).
We now discuss the categorical analogues of these statements.
12 It is customary to multiply the right hand side of this formula, for irreducible
representation V , by a scalar depending on q and the highest weight of V , but
this is not essential for our discussion.

7.2 Unramiﬁed Categories gκc-Modules
In the categorical setting, the role of an irreducible representation (R, π) of
G(F) is played by the category gκc -modχ for some χ ∈OpLG(D×). The ana-
logue of an unramiﬁed representation is a category gκc -modχ which contains
non-zero (gκc, G[[t]]) Harish-Chandra modules. This leads us to the follow-
ing question: for what χ ∈OpLG(D×) does the category gκc -modχ contain
non-zero (gκc, G[[t]]) Harish-Chandra modules?
We saw in the previous section that (R, π) is unramiﬁed if and only if it
corresponds to an unramiﬁed Langlands parameter, which is a homomorphism
W ′
F →LG that factors through W ′
F →Z. Recall that in the geometric setting
the Langlands parameters are LG-local systems on D×. The analogues of
unramiﬁed homomorphisms W ′
F →LG are those local systems on D× which
extend to the disc D, in other words, have no singularity at the origin 0 ∈D.
Note that there is a unique, up to isomorphism local system on D. Indeed,
suppose that we are given a regular connection on a LG-bundle F on D. Let
us trivialize the ﬁber F0 of F at 0 ∈D. Then, because D is contractible, the
connection identiﬁes F with the trivial bundle on D. Under this identiﬁcation
the connection itself becomes trivial, i.e., represented by the operator ∇= ∂t.
Therefore all regular LG-local systems (i.e., those which extend to D)
correspond to a single point of the set LocLG(D×), namely, the equivalence
class of the trivial local system σ0.13 From the point of view of the realization
of LocLG(D×) as the quotient (3.2) this simply means that there is a unique
LG((t)) gauge equivalence class containing all regular connections of the form
∂t + A(t), where A(t) ∈Lg[[t]].
The gauge equivalence class of regular connections is the unique local
Langlands parameter that we may view as unramiﬁed in the geometric set-
ting. Therefore, by analogy with the unramiﬁed Langlands correspondence for
G(F), we expect that the category gκc -modχ contains non-zero (gκc, G[[t]])
Harish-Chandra modules if and only if the LG-oper χ ∈OpLG(D×) is LG((t))
gauge equivalent to the trivial connection, or, in other words, χ belongs to
the ﬁber α−1(σ0) over σ0.
What does this ﬁber look like? Let P + be the set of dominant integral
weights of G (equivalently, dominant integral coweights of LG). In [FG2] we
deﬁned, for each λ ∈P +, the space Opλ
LG of LB[[t]]-equivalence classes of
operators of the form
(7.6)
∇= ∂t +
ℓ

i=1
t⟨ˇαi,λ⟩ψi(t)fi + v(t),
13 Note however that the trivial LG-local system on D has a non-trivial group of
automorphisms, namely, the group LG itself (it may be realized as the group of
automorphisms of the ﬁber at 0 ∈D). Therefore if we think of LocLG(D×) as a
stack rather than as a set, then the trivial local system corresponds to a substack
pt /LG.

where ψi(t) ∈C[[t]], ψi(0) ̸= 0, v(t) ∈Lb[[t]].
Lemma 2. Suppose that the local system underlying an oper χ ∈OpLG(D×)
is trivial. Then χ belongs to the disjoint union of the subsets Opλ
LG ⊂
OpLG(D×), λ ∈P +.
Proof. It is clear from the deﬁnition that any oper in Opλ
LG is regular on
the disc D and is therefore LG((t)) gauge equivalent to the trivial connection.
Now suppose that we have an oper χ = (F, ∇, FLB) such that the underly-
ing LG-local system is trivial. Then ∇is LG((t)) gauge equivalent to a regular
connection, that is one of the form ∂t + A(t), where A(t) ∈Lg[[t]]. We have
the decomposition LG((t)) = LG[[t]]LB((t)). The gauge action of LG[[t]] clearly
preserves the space of regular connections. Therefore if an oper connection ∇
is LG((t)) gauge equivalent to a regular connection, then its LB((t)) gauge class
already must contain a regular connection. The oper condition then implies
that this gauge class contains a connection operator of the form (7.6) for some
dominant integral weight λ of LG. Therefore χ ∈Opλ
LG.
□
Thus, we see that the set of opers corresponding to the (unique) unramiﬁed
Langlands parameter is the disjoint union /
λ∈P + Opλ
LG. We call such opers
“unramiﬁed”. The following result then conﬁrms our expectation that the cat-
egory gκc -modχ is “unramiﬁed”, that is contains non-zero G[[t]]-equivariant
objects, if and only if χ is unramiﬁed (see [FG3] for a proof).
Lemma 3. The category gκc -modχ contains a non-zero (gκc, G[[t]]) Harish-
Chandra module if and only if
(7.7)
χ ∈

λ∈P +
Opλ
LG .
The next question is to describe the category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
of (gκc, G[[t]])
modules for χ ∈Opλ
LG.
7.3 Categories of G[[t]]-Equivariant Modules
Let us recall from Section 7.1 that the space of K0-invariant vectors in an
unramiﬁed irreducible representation of G(F) is always one-dimensional. We
have proposed that the category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
should be viewed as a categor-
ical analogue of this space. Therefore we expect it to be the simplest possible
abelian category: the category of C-vector spaces. Here we assume that χ
belongs to the union of the spaces Opλ
LG, where λ ∈P +, for otherwise the
category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
would be trivial (zero object is the only object).
In this subsection we will prove, following [FG1] (see also [BD1]), that our
expectation is in fact correct provided that λ = 0, in which case Op0
LG =
OpLG(D), and so
χ ∈OpLG(D) ⊂OpLG(D×).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
89
We will also conjecture that this is true for χ ∈Opλ
LG for all λ ∈P +.
Recall the vacuum module V0 = Vκc(g). According to [FF3, F3], we have
(7.8)
Endgκc V0 ≃Fun OpLG(D).
Let χ ∈OpLG(D) ⊂OpLG(D×). Then χ deﬁnes a character of the algebra
Endgκc V0. Let V0(χ) be the quotient of V0 by the kernel of this character.
Then we have the following result.
Theorem 3. Let χ ∈OpLG(D) ⊂OpLG(D×). The category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
is equivalent to the category of vector spaces: its unique, up to isomorphism,
irreducible object is V0(χ) and any other object is isomorphic to the direct
sum of copies of V0(χ).
This theorem provides the ﬁrst piece of evidence for Conjecture 2: we
see that the categories gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
are equivalent to each other for all χ ∈
OpLG(D).
It is more convenient to consider, instead of an individual regular LG-oper
χ, the entire family Op0
LG = OpLG(D) of regular opers on the disc D. Let
gκc -modreg be the full subcategory of the category gκc -mod whose objects
are gκc-modules on which the action of the center Z(g) factors through the
homomorphism
Z(g) ≃Fun OpLG(D×) →Fun OpLG(D).
Note that the category gκc -modreg is an example of a category gκc -modV
introduced in Section 5, in the case when V = OpLG(D).
Let gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
be the corresponding G[[t]]-equivariant category. It is
instructive to think of gκc -modreg and gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
as categories ﬁbered
over OpLG(D), with the ﬁbers over χ ∈OpLG(D) being gκc -modχ and
gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
, respectively.
We will now describe the category gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
. This description will in
particular imply Theorem 3.
In order to simplify our formulas, in what follows we will use the following
notation for Fun OpLG(D):
z = z(g) = Fun OpLG(D).
Let z -mod be the category of modules over the commutative algebra z.
Equivalently, this is the category of quasicoherent sheaves on the space
OpLG(D).
By deﬁnition, any object of gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
is a z-module. Introduce the
functors
F :gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
→z -mod,
M →Homgκc (V0, M),
G :z -mod →gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
,
F →V0 ⊗
z F.

90
E. Frenkel
The following theorem has been proved in [FG1], Theorem 6.3 (important
results in this direction were obtained earlier in [BD1]).
Theorem 4. The functors F and G are mutually inverse equivalences of cat-
egories
(7.9)
gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
≃z -mod .
This immediately implies Theorem 3. Indeed, for each χ ∈OpLG(D) the
category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
is the full subcategory of gκc -modG[[t]]
reg
which are an-
nihilated, as z-modules, by the maximal ideal Iχ of χ. By Theorem 4, this
category is equivalent to the category of z-modules annihilated by Iχ. But this
is the category of z-modules supported (scheme-theoretically) at the point χ,
which is equivalent to the category of vector spaces.
7.4 The Action of the Spherical Hecke Algebra
In Section 7.1 we discussed irreducible unramiﬁed representations of the group
G(F), where F is a local non-archimedian ﬁeld. We have seen that such repre-
sentations are parameterized by conjugacy classes of the Langlands dual group
LG. Given such a conjugacy class γ, we have an irreducible unramiﬁed rep-
resentation (Rγ, πγ), which contains a one-dimensional subspace (Rγ)πγ(K0)
of K0-invariant vectors. The spherical Hecke algebra H(G(F), K0), which is
isomorphic to Rep LG via the Satake isomorphism, acts on this space by a
character φγ, see formula (7.5).
In the geometric setting, we have argued that for any χ ∈OpLG(D)
the category gκc -modχ, equipped with an action of the loop group G((t)),
should be viewed as a categoriﬁcation of (Rγ, πγ). Furthermore, its subcate-
gory gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
of (gκc, G[[t]]) Harish-Chandra modules should be viewed
as a categoriﬁcation of the one-dimensional space (Rγ)πγ(K0). According to
Theorem 3, the latter category is equivalent to the category of vector spaces,
which is consistent with our expectations.
We now discuss the categorical analogue of the action of the spherical
Hecke algebra.
As explained in Section 6.3, the categorical analogue of the spherical Hecke
algebra is the category of G[[t]]-equivariant D-modules on the aﬃne Grass-
mannian Gr = G((t))/G[[t]]. We refer the reader to [BD1, FG2] for the precise
deﬁnition of Gr and this category. There is an important property that is sat-
isﬁed in the unramiﬁed case: the convolution functors with these D-modules
are exact, which means that we do not need to consider the derived category;
the abelian category of such D-modules will do. Let us denote this abelian
category by H(G((t)), G[[t]]).
According to the results of [MV], this category carries a natural structure
of tensor category, which is equivalent to the tensor category Rep LG of rep-
resentations of LG. This should be viewed as a categorical analogue of the

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
91
Satake isomorphism. Thus, for each object V of Rep LG we have an object of
H(G((t)), G[[t]]) which we denote by HV . What should be the analogue of the
Hecke eigenvector property (7.5)?
As we explained in Section 6.3, the category H(G((t)), G[[t]]) naturally
acts on the category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
, and this action should be viewed as a
categorical analogue of the action of H(G(F), K0) on (Rγ)πγ(K0).
Now, by Theorem 3, any object of gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
is a direct sum of copies
of V0(χ). Therefore it is suﬃcient to describe the action of H(G((t)), G[[t]])
on V0(χ). This action is described by the following statement, which follows
from [BD1]: there exists a family of isomorphisms
(7.10)
αV : HV ⋆V0(χ)
∼
−→V ⊗V0(χ),
V ∈Rep LG,
where V is the vector space underlying the representation V . Moreover, these
isomorphisms are compatible with the tensor product structure on HV (given
by the convolution) and on V (given by tensor product of vector spaces).
In view of Theorem 3, this is not surprising. Indeed, it follows from the
deﬁnition that HV ⋆V0(χ) is again an object of the category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
.
Therefore it must be isomorphic to UV ⊗C V0(χ), where UV is a vector space.
But then we obtain a functor H(G((t)), G[[t]]) →Vect, HV →UV . It follows
from the construction that this is a tensor functor. Therefore the standard
Tannakian formalism implies that UV is isomorphic to V .
The isomorphisms (7.10) should be viewed as the categorical analogues of
the Hecke eigenvector conditions (7.5). The diﬀerence is that while in (7.5) the
action of elements of the Hecke algebra on a K0-invariant vector in Rγ amounts
to multiplication by a scalar, the action of an object of the Hecke category
H(G((t)), G[[t]]) on the G[[t]]-equivariant object V0(χ) of gκc -modχ amounts
to multiplication by a vector space, namely, the vector space underlying the
corresponding representation of LG. It is natural to call a module satisfying
this property a Hecke eigenmodule. Thus, we obtain that V0(χ) is a Hecke
eigenmodule. This is in agreement with our expectation that the category
gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
is a categorical version of the space of K0-invariant vectors in
Rγ.
One ingredient that is missing in the geometric case is the conjugacy class
γ of LG. We recall that in the classical Langlands correspondence this was the
image of the Frobenius element of the Galois group Gal(Fq/Fq), which does
not have an analogue in the geometric setting where our ground ﬁeld is C,
which is algebraically closed. So while unramiﬁed local systems in the classical
case are parameterized by the conjugacy classes γ, there is only one, up to
an isomorphism, unramiﬁed local system in the geometric case. However, this
local system has a large group of automorphisms, namely, LG itself. One can
argue that what replaces γ in the geometric setting is the action of this group
LG by automorphisms of the category gκc -modχ, which we will discuss in the
next two sections.

7.5 Categories of Representations and D-Modules
When we discussed the procedure of categoriﬁcation of representations in
Section 3.5, we saw that there are two possible scenarios for constructing
categories equipped with an action of the loop group G((t)). In the ﬁrst one
we consider categories of D-modules on the ind-schemes G((t))/K, where K
is a “compact” subgroup of G((t)), such as G[[t]] or the Iwahori subgroup. In
the second one we consider categories of representations gκc -modχ. So far we
have focused exclusively on the second scenario, but it is instructive to also
discuss categories of the ﬁrst type.
In the toy model considered in Section 3.4 we discussed the category of g-
modules with ﬁxed central character and the category of D-modules on the ﬂag
variety G/B. We have argued that both could be viewed as categoriﬁcations of
the representation of the group G(Fq) on the space of functions on (G/B)(Fq).
These categories are equivalent, according to the Beilinson-Bernstein theory,
with the functor of global sections connecting the two. Could something like
this be true in the case of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras as well?
The aﬃne Grassmannian Gr = G((t))/G[[t]] may be viewed as the simplest
possible analogue of the ﬂag variety G/B for the loop group G((t)). Consider
the category of D-modules on G((t))/G[[t]] (see [BD1, FG2] for the precise
deﬁnition). We have a functor of global sections from this category to the
category of g((t))-modules. In order to obtain gκc-modules, we need to take
instead the category Dκc -mod of D-modules twisted by a line bundle Lκc.
This is the unique line bundle Lκc on Gr which carries an action of gκc (such
that the central element 1 is mapped to the identity) lifting the natural ac-
tion of g((t)) on Gr. Then for any object M of Dκc -mod, the space of global
sections Γ(Gr, M) is a gκc-module. Moreover, it is known (see [BD1, FG1])
that Γ(Gr, M) is in fact an object of gκc -modreg. Therefore we have a functor
of global sections
Γ : Dκc -mod →gκc -modreg .
We note that the categories D -mod and Dκc -mod are equivalent under the
functor M →M ⊗Lκc. But the corresponding global sections functors are
very diﬀerent.
However, unlike in the Beilinson-Bernstein scenario, the functor Γ can-
not possibly be an equivalence of categories. There are two reasons for this.
First of all, the category gκc -modreg has a large center, namely, the algebra
z = Fun OpLG(D), while the center of the category Dκc -mod is trivial.14 The
second, and more serious, reason is that the category Dκc -mod carries an
14 Recall that we are under the assumption that G is a connected simply-connected
algebraic group, and in this case Gr has one connected component. In general,
the center of the category Dκc -mod has a basis enumerated by the connected
components of Gr and is isomorphic to the group algebra of the ﬁnite group
π1(G).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
93
additional symmetry, namely, an action of the tensor category RepLG of rep-
resentations of the Langlands dual group LG, and this action trivializes under
the functor Γ as we explain presently.
Over OpLG(D) there exists a canonical principal LG-bundle, which we
will denote by P. By deﬁnition, the ﬁber of P at χ = (F, ∇, FLB) ∈OpLG(D)
is F0, the ﬁber at 0 ∈D of the LG-bundle F underlying χ. For an object
V ∈Rep LG let us denote by V the associated vector bundle over OpLG(D),
i.e.,
V = P ×
LG V.
Next, consider the category Dκc -modG[[t]] of G[[t]]-equivariant Dκc-modu-
les on Gr. It is equivalent to the category
D -modG[[t]] = H(G((t)), G[[t]])
considered above. This is a tensor category, with respect to the convolution
functor, which is equivalent to the category Rep LG. We will use the same
notation HV for the object of Dκc -modG[[t]] corresponding to V ∈Rep LG.
The category Dκc -modG[[t]] acts on Dκc -mod by convolution functors
M →HV ⋆M
which are exact. This amounts to a tensor action of the category RepLG on
Dκc -mod.
Now, A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld have proved in [BD1] that there are
functorial isomorphisms
Γ(Gr, HV ⋆M) ≃Γ(Gr, M) ⊗
z V,
V ∈Rep LG,
compatible with the tensor structure. Thus, we see that there are non-
isomorphic objects of Dκc -mod, which the functor Γ sends to isomorphic
objects of gκc -modreg. Therefore the category Dκc -mod and the functor Γ
need to be modiﬁed in order to have a chance to obtain a category equivalent
to gκc -modreg.
In [FG2] it was shown how to modify the category Dκc -mod, by simulta-
neously “adding” to it z as a center, and “dividing” it by the above Rep LG-
action. As the result, we obtain a candidate for a category that can be equiv-
alent to gκc -modreg. This is the category of Hecke eigenmodules on Gr,
denoted by DHecke
κc
-modreg.
By deﬁnition, an object of DHecke
κc
-modreg is an object of Dκc -mod,
equipped with an action of the algebra z by endomorphisms and a system
of isomorphisms
αV : HV ⋆M
∼
−→V ⊗
z M,
V ∈Rep LG,
compatible with the tensor structure.

94
E. Frenkel
The above functor Γ naturally gives rise to a functor
(7.11)
Γ Hecke : DHecke
κc
-modreg →gκc -modreg .
This is in fact a general property. Suppose for simplicity that we have an
abelian category C which is acted upon by the tensor category Rep H, where
H is an algebraic group; we denote this functor by M →M ⋆V, V ∈Rep H.
Let CHecke be the category whose objects are collections (M, {αV }V ∈Rep H),
where M ∈C and {αV } is a compatible system of isomorphisms
αV : M ⋆V
∼
−→V ⊗
C M,
V ∈Rep H,
where V is the vector space underlying V . One may think of CHecke as the
“de-equivariantized” category C with respect to the action of H. It carries a
natural action of the group H: for h ∈H, we have
h · (M, {αV }V ∈Rep H) = (M, {(h ⊗idM) ◦αV }V ∈Rep H).
In other words, M remains unchanged, but the isomorphisms αV get composed
with h.
The category C may in turn be reconstructed as the category of H-
equivariant objects of CHecke with respect to this action, see [Ga3].
Suppose that we have a functor G : C →C′, such that we have functorial
isomorphisms
(7.12)
G(M ⋆V ) ≃G(M) ⊗
C V ,
V ∈Rep H,
compatible with the tensor structure. Then, according to [AG], there exists a
functor GHecke : CHecke →C′ such that G ≃GHecke◦Ind, where the functor Ind :
C →CHecke sends M to M ⋆OH, where OH is the regular representation of H.
The functor GHecke may be explicitly described as follows: the isomorphisms
αV and (7.12) give rise to an action of the algebra OH on G(M), and GHecke(M)
is obtained by taking the ﬁber of G(M) at 1 ∈H.
We take C = Dκc -mod, C′ = gκc -modreg, and G = Γ. The only diﬀerence
is that now we are working over the base OpLG(D), which we have to take into
account. Thus, we obtain a functor (7.11) (see [FG2, FG4] for more details).
Moreover, the left action of the group G((t)) on Gr gives rise to its action on
the category DHecke
κc
-modreg, and the functor Γ Hecke intertwines this action
with the action of G((t)) on gκc -modreg.
The following was conjectured in [FG2]:
Conjecture 3. The functor Γ Hecke in formula (7.11) deﬁnes an equivalence
of the categories DHecke
κc
-modreg and gκc -modreg.
It was proved in [FG2] that the functor Γ Hecke, when extended to the
derived categories, is fully faithful. Furthermore, it was proved in [FG4] that

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
95
it sets up an equivalence of the corresponding I0-equivariant categories, where
I0 = [I, I] is the radical of the Iwahori subgroup.
Let us specialize Conjecture 3 to a point χ = (F, ∇, FLB) ∈OpLG(D).
Then on the right hand side we consider the category gκc -modχ, and on the
left hand side we consider the category DHecke
κc
-modχ. Its objects consist of a
Dκc-module M and a collection of isomorphisms
(7.13)
αV : HV ⋆M
∼
−→VF0 ⊗M,
V ∈Rep LG.
Here VF0 is the twist of the representation V by the LG-torsor F0. These
isomorphisms have to be compatible with the tensor structure on the category
H(G((t)), G[[t]]).
Conjecture 3 implies that there is a canonical equivalence of categories
(7.14)
DHecke
κc
-modχ ≃gκc -modχ .
It is this conjectural equivalence that should be viewed as an analogue of the
Beilinson-Bernstein equivalence.
From this point of view, one can think of each of the categories DHecke
κc
-modχ
as the second incarnation of the sought-after Langlands category Cσ0 corre-
sponding to the trivial LG-local system.
Now we give another explanation why it is natural to view the cate-
gory DHecke
κc
-modχ as a categoriﬁcation of an unramiﬁed representation of
the group G(F). First of all, observe that these categories are all equivalent
to each other and to the category DHecke
κc
-mod, whose objects are Dκc-modules
M together with a collection of isomorphisms
(7.15)
αV : HV ⋆M
∼
−→V ⊗M,
V ∈Rep LG.
Comparing formulas (7.13) and (7.15), we see that there is an equivalence
DHecke
κc
-modχ ≃DHecke
κc
-mod,
for each choice of trivialization of the LG-torsor F0 (the ﬁber at 0 ∈D of the
principal LG-bundle F on D underlying the oper χ).
Now recall from Section 7.1 that to each semi-simple conjugacy class γ in
LG corresponds an irreducible unramiﬁed representation (Rγ, πγ) of G(F) via
the Satake correspondence (7.2). It is known that there is a non-degenerate
pairing
⟨, ⟩: Rγ × Rγ−1 →C,
in other words, Rγ−1 is the representation of G(F) which is contragredient to
Rγ (it may be realized in the space of smooth vectors in the dual space to
Rγ).
Let v ∈Rγ−1 be a non-zero vector such that K0v = v (this vector is unique
up to a scalar). It then satisﬁes the Hecke eigenvector property (7.5) (in which
we need to replace γ by γ−1). This allows us to embed Rγ into the space of

96
E. Frenkel
locally constant right K0-invariant functions on G(F) (equivalently, functions
on G(F)/K0), by using matrix coeﬃcients, as follows:
u ∈Rγ →fu,
fu(g) = ⟨u, gv⟩.
The Hecke eigenvector property (7.5) implies that the functions fu are right
K0-invariant and satisfy the condition
(7.16)
f ⋆HV = Tr(γ−1, V )f,
where ⋆denotes the convolution product (6.1). Let C(G(F)/K0)γ be the
space of locally constant functions on G(F)/K0 satisfying (7.16). It carries
a representation of G(F) induced by its left action on G(F)/K0. We have
constructed an injective map Rγ →C(G(R)/G(R))γ, and one can show that
for generic γ it is an isomorphism.
Thus, we obtain a realization of an irreducible unramiﬁed representation
of G(F) in the space of functions on the quotient G(F)/K0 satisfying the
Hecke eigenfunction condition (7.16). The Hecke eigenmodule condition (7.15)
may be viewed as a categorical analogue of (7.16). Therefore the category
DHecke
κc
-mod of twisted D-modules on Gr = G((t))/K0 satisfying the Hecke
eigenmodule condition (7.15), equipped with a G((t))-action appears to be a
natural categoriﬁcation of the irreducible unramiﬁed representations of G(F).
7.6 Equivalences Between Categories of Modules
All opers in OpLG(D) correspond to one and the same LG-local system,
namely, the trivial local system. Therefore, according to Conjecture 2, we ex-
pect that the categories gκc -modχ are equivalent to each other. More precisely,
for each isomorphism between the underlying local systems of any two opers
in OpLG(D) we wish to have an equivalence of the corresponding categories,
and these equivalences should be compatible with respect to the operation of
composition of these isomorphisms.
Let us spell this out in detail. Let χ = (F, ∇, FLB) and χ′ = (F′, ∇′, F′
LB)
be two opers in OpLG(D). Then an isomorphism between the underlying local
systems (F, ∇)
∼
−→(F′, ∇′) is the same as an isomorphism F0
∼
−→F′
0 between
the LG-torsors F0 and F′
0, which are the ﬁbers of the LG-bundles F and F′,
respectively, at 0 ∈D. Let us denote this set of isomorphisms by Isomχ,χ′.
Then we have
Isomχ,χ′ = F0 ×
LG
LG ×
LG F′
0,
where we twist LG by F0 with respect to the left action and by F′
0 with respect
to the right action. In particular,
Isomχ,χ = LGF0 = F0 ×
LG Ad LG
is just the group of automorphisms of F0.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
97
It is instructive to combine the sets Isomχ,χ′ into a groupoid Isom over
OpLG(D). Thus, by deﬁnition Isom consists of triples (χ, χ′, φ), where χ, χ′ ∈
OpLG(D) and φ ∈Isomχ,χ is an isomorphism of the underlying local systems.
The two morphisms Isom →OpLG(D) correspond to sending such a triple to
χ and χ′. The identity morphism OpLG(D) →Isom sends χ to (χ, χ, Id), and
the composition morphism
Isom
×
OpLG(D) Isom →Isom
corresponds to composing two isomorphisms.
Conjecture 2 has the following more precise formulation for regular opers:
Conjecture 4. For each φ ∈Isomχ,χ′ there exists an equivalence
Eφ : gκc -modχ →gκc -modχ′,
which intertwines the actions of G((t)) on the two categories, such that EId =
Id and there exist isomorphisms βφ,φ′ : Eφ◦φ′ ≃Eφ ◦Eφ′ satisfying
βφ◦φ′,φ′′βφ,φ′ = βφ,φ′◦φ′′βφ′,φ′′
for all isomorphisms φ, φ′, φ′′, whenever they may be composed in the appro-
priate order.
In other words, the groupoid Isom over OpLG(D) acts on the category
gκc -modreg ﬁbered over OpLG(D), preserving the action of G((t)) along the
ﬁbers.
In particular, this conjecture implies that the group LGF0 acts on the
category gκc -modχ for any χ ∈OpLG(D).
Now we observe that Conjecture 3 implies Conjecture 4. Indeed, by Con-
jecture 3, there is a canonical equivalence of categories (7.14),
DHecke
κc
-modχ ≃gκc -modχ .
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the category DHecke
κc
-modχ
(namely, formula (7.13)) that for each isomorphism φ ∈Isomχ,χ′, i.e., an
isomorphism of the LG-torsors F0 and F′
0 underlying the opers χ and χ′,
there is a canonical equivalence
DHecke
κc
-modχ ≃DHecke
κc
-modχ′ .
Therefore we obtain the sought-after equivalence Eφ :gκc -modχ →gκc -modχ′.
Furthermore, it is clear that these equivalences satisfy the conditions of Con-
jecture 4. In particular, they intertwine the actions of G((t)), which aﬀects the
D-module M underlying an object of DHecke
κc
-modχ, but does not aﬀect the
isomorphisms αV .

E. Frenkel
Equivalently, we can express this by saying that the groupoid Isom natu-
rally acts on the category DHecke
κc
-modreg. By Conjecture 3, this gives rise to
an action of Isom on gκc -modreg.
In particular, we construct an action of the group (LG)F0, the twist of
LG by the LG-torsor F0 underlying a particular oper χ, on the category
DHecke
κc
-modχ. Indeed, each element g ∈(LG)F0 acts on the F0-twist VF0 of
any ﬁnite-dimensional representation V of LG. Given an object (M, (αV ))
of DHecke
κc
-modχ′, we construct a new object, namely, (M, ((g ⊗IdM) ◦αV )).
Thus, we do not change the D-module M, but we change the isomorphisms αV
appearing in the Hecke eigenmodule condition (7.13) by composing them with
the action of g on VF0. According to Conjecture 3, the category DHecke
κc
-modχ
is equivalent to gκc -modχ. Therefore this gives rise to an action of the group
(LG)F0 on gκc -modχ. But this action is much more diﬃcult to describe in
terms of gκc-modules.
7.7 Generalization to other Dominant Integral Weights
We have extensively studied above the categories gκc -modχ and gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
associated to regular opers χ ∈OpLG(D). However, according to Lemma 2,
the (set-theoretic) ﬁber of the map α : OpLG(D×) →LocLG(D×) over the
trivial local system σ0 is the disjoint union of the subsets Opλ
LG, λ ∈P +. Here
we discuss brieﬂy the categories gκc -modχ and gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
for χ ∈Opλ
LG,
where λ ̸= 0.
Consider the Weyl module Vλ with highest weight λ,
Vλ = U(gκc)
⊗
U(g[[t]]⊕C1) Vλ.
According to [FG6], we have
(7.17)
Endgκc Vλ ≃Fun Opλ
LG .
Let χ ∈Opλ
LG ⊂OpLG(D×). Then χ deﬁnes a character of the algebra
Endgκc Vλ. Let Vλ(χ) be the quotient of Vλ by the kernel of this character.
The following conjecture of [FG6] is an analogue of Theorem 3:
Conjecture 5. Let χ ∈Opλ
LG ⊂OpLG(D×). Then the category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
is equivalent to the category of vector spaces: its unique, up to isomorphism,
irreducible object is Vλ(χ) and any other object is isomorphic to the direct
sum of copies of Vλ(χ).
Note that this is consistent with Conjecture 2, which tells us that the
categories gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
should be equivalent to each other for all opers which
are gauge equivalent to the trivial local system on D.

8 Local Langlands Correspondence: Tamely Ramiﬁed
Case
In the previous section we have considered categorical analogues of the ir-
reducible unramiﬁed representations of a reductive group G(F) over a local
non-archimedian ﬁeld F. We recall that these are the representations contain-
ing non-zero vectors ﬁxed by the maximal compact subgroup K0 ⊂G(F).
The corresponding Langlands parameters are unramiﬁed admissible homo-
morphisms from the Weil-Deligne group W ′
F to LG, i.e., those which factor
through the quotient
W ′
F →WF →Z,
and whose image in LG is semi-simple. Such homomorphisms are parameter-
ized by semi-simple conjugacy classes in LG.
We have seen that the categorical analogues of unramiﬁed representations
of G(F) are the categories gκc -modχ (equipped with an action of the loop
group G((t))), where χ is a LG-oper on D× whose underlying LG-local system
is trivial. These categories can be called unramiﬁed in the sense that they
contain non-zero G[[t]]-equivariant objects. The corresponding Langlands pa-
rameter is the trivial LG-local system σ0 on D×, which should be viewed as
an analogue of an unramiﬁed homomorphism W ′
F →LG. However, the local
system σ0 is realized by many diﬀerent opers, and this introduces an addi-
tional complication into our picture: at the end of the day we need to show
that the categories gκc -modχ, where χ is of the above type, are equivalent
to each other. In particular, Conjecture 4, which describes what we expect to
happen when χ ∈OpLG(D).
The next natural step is to consider categorical analogues of represen-
tations of G(F) that contain vectors invariant under the Iwahori subgroup
I ⊂G[[t]], the preimage of a ﬁxed Borel subgroup B ⊂G under the evalu-
ation homomorphism G[[t]] →G. We begin this section by recalling a clas-
siﬁcation of these representations, due to D. Kazhdan and G. Lusztig [KL]
and V. Ginzburg [CG]. We then discuss the categorical analogues of these
representations following [FG2]–[FG5] and the intricate interplay between the
classical and the geometric pictures.
8.1 Tamely Ramiﬁed Representations
The Langlands parameters corresponding to irreducible representations of
G(F) with I-invariant vectors are tamely ramiﬁed homomorphisms W ′
F →
LG. Recall from Section 2.1 that W ′
F = WF ⋉C. A homomorphism W ′
F →LG
is called tamely ramiﬁed if it factors through the quotient
W ′
F →Z ⋉C.
According to the relation (2.1), the group Z ⋉C is generated by two elements
F = 1 ∈Z (Frobenius) and M = 1 ∈C (monodromy) satisfying the relation

100
E. Frenkel
(8.1)
FMF −1 = qM.
Under an admissible tamely ramiﬁed homomorphism the generator F goes
to a semi-simple element γ ∈LG and the generator M goes to a unipotent
element N ∈LG. According to formula (8.1), they have to satisfy the relation
(8.2)
γNγ−1 = N q.
Alternatively, we may write N = exp(u), where u is a nilpotent element of
Lg. Then this relation becomes
γuγ−1 = qu.
Thus, we have the following bijection between the sets of equivalence
classes
(8.3)
tamely ramiﬁed admissible
homomorphisms W ′
F →LG
⇐⇒
pairs γ ∈LG, semi-simple,
u ∈Lg, nilpotent, γuγ−1 = qu
In both cases equivalence relation amounts to conjugation by an element of
LG.
Now to each Langlands parameter of this type we wish to attach an irre-
ducible representation of G(F) which contains non-zero I-invariant vectors. It
turns out that if G = GLn there is indeed a bijection, proved in [BZ], between
the sets of equivalence classes of the following objects:
(8.4)
tamely ramiﬁed admissible
homomorphisms W ′
F →GLn
⇐⇒
irreducible representations
(R, π) of GLn(F), Rπ(I) ̸= 0
However, such a bijection is no longer true for other reductive groups: two
new phenomena appear, which we discuss presently.
The ﬁrst one is the appearance of L-packets. One no longer expects to be
able to assign to a particular admissible homomorphism W ′
F →LG a single
irreducible smooth representations of G(F). Instead, a ﬁnite collection of such
representations (more precisely, a collection of equivalence classes of represen-
tations) is assigned, called an L-packet. In order to distinguish representations
in a given L-packet, one needs to introduce an additional parameter. We will
see how this is done in the case at hand shortly. However, and this is the second
subtlety alluded to above, it turns out that not all irreducible representations
of G(F) within the L-packet associated to a given tamely ramiﬁed homomor-
phism W ′
F →LG contain non-zero I-invariant vectors. Fortunately, there is
a certain property of the extra parameter used to distinguish representations
inside the L-packet that tells us whether the corresponding representation of
G(F) has I-invariant vectors.
In the case of tamely ramiﬁed homomorphisms W ′
F →LG this extra pa-
rameter is an irreducible representation ρ of the ﬁnite group C(γ, u) of com-
ponents of the simultaneous centralizer of γ and u in LG, on which the center

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
101
of LG acts trivially (see [Lu1]). In the case of G = GLn these centralizers
are always connected, and so this parameter never appears. But for other re-
ductive groups G this group of components is often non-trivial. The simplest
example is when LG = G2 and u is a subprincipal nilpotent element of the
Lie algebra Lg.15 In this case for some γ satisfying γuγ−1 = qu the group of
components C(γ, u) is the symmetric group S3, which has three irreducible
representations (up to equivalence). Each of them corresponds to a particular
member of the L-packet associated with the tamely ramiﬁed homomorphism
W ′
F →LG deﬁned by (γ, u). Thus, the L-packet consists of three (equivalence
classes of) irreducible smooth representations of G(F). However, not all of
them contain non-zero I-invariant vectors.
The representations ρ of the ﬁnite group C(γ, u) which correspond to repre-
sentations of G(F) with I-invariant vectors are distinguished by the following
property. Consider the Springer ﬁber Spu. We recall that
(8.5)
Spu = {b′ ∈LG/LB | u ∈b′}.
The group C(γ, u) acts on the homology of the variety Spγ
u of γ-ﬁxed points
of Spu. A representation ρ of C(γ, u) corresponds to a representation of G(F)
with non-zero I-invariant vectors if and only if ρ occurs in the homology of
Spγ
u, H•(Spγ
u).
In the case of G2 the Springer ﬁber Spu of the subprincipal element u is
a union of four projective lines connected with each other as in the Dynkin
diagram of D4. For some γ the set Spγ
u is the union of a projective line (cor-
responding to the central vertex in the Dynkin diagram of D4) and three
points (each in one of the remaining three projective lines). The correspond-
ing group C(γ, u) = S3 on Spγ
u acts trivially on the projective line and by
permutation of the three points. Therefore the trivial and the two-dimensional
representations of S3 occur in H•(Spγ
u), but the sign representation does not.
The irreducible representations of G(F) corresponding to the ﬁrst two con-
tain non-zero I-invariant vectors, whereas the one corresponding to the sign
representation of S3 does not.
The ultimate form of the local Langlands correspondence for representa-
tions of G(F) with I-invariant vectors is then as follows (here we assume, as
in [KL, CG]), that the group G is split and has connected center):
(8.6)
triples (γ, u, ρ), γuγ−1 = qu,
ρ ∈Rep C(γ, u) occurs in H•(Spγ
u, C)
⇐⇒
irreducible representations
(R, π) of G(F), Rπ(I) ̸= 0
Again, this should be understood as a bijection between two sets of equivalence
classes of the objects listed. This bijection is due to [KL] (see also [CG]). It
was conjectured by Deligne and Langlands, with a subsequent modiﬁcation
(addition of ρ) made by Lusztig.
15 The term “subprincipal” means that the adjoint orbit of this element has codi-
mension 2 in the nilpotent cone.

102
E. Frenkel
How to set up this bijection? The idea is to replace irreducible representa-
tions of G(F) appearing on the right hand side of (8.6) with irreducible mod-
ules over the corresponding Hecke algebra H(G(F), I). Recall from Section 6.1
that this is the algebra of compactly supported I bi-invariant functions on
G(F), with respect to convolution. It naturally acts on the space of I-invariant
vectors of any smooth representation of G(F) (see formula (6.2)). Thus, we
obtain a functor from the category of smooth representations of G(F) to the
category of H(G(F), I). According to a theorem of A. Borel [B1], it induces a
bijection between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations
of G(F) with non-zero I-invariant vectors and the set of equivalence classes
of irreducible H(G(F), I)-modules.
The algebra H(G(F), I) is known as the aﬃne Hecke algebra and has
the standard description in terms of generators and relations. However, for
our purposes we need another description, due to [KL, CG], which identiﬁes
it with the equivariant K-theory of the Steinberg variety
St = N ×
N
N,
where N ⊂Lg is the nilpotent cone and N is the Springer resolution
N = {x ∈N, b′ ∈LG/LB | x ∈b′}.
Thus, a point of St is a triple consisting of a nilpotent element of Lg and two
Borel subalgebras containing it. The group LG × C× naturally acts on St,
with LG conjugating members of the triple and C× acting by multiplication
on the nilpotent elements,
(8.7)
a · (x, b′, b′′) = (a−1x, b′, b′′).
According to a theorem of [KL, CG], there is an isomorphism
(8.8)
H(G(F), I) ≃K
LG×C×(St).
The right hand side is the LG×C×-equivariant K-theory of St. It is an algebra
with respect to a natural operation of convolution (see [CG] for details). It is
also a free module over its center, isomorphic to
K
LG×C×(pt) = Rep LG ⊗C[q, q−1].
Under the isomorphism (8.8) the element q goes to the standard parameter
q of the aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(F), I) (here we consider H(G(F), I) as a
C[q, q−1]-module).
Now, the algebra K
LG×C×(St), and hence the algebra H(G(F), I), has a
natural family of modules which are parameterized precisely by the conjugacy
classes of pairs (γ, u) as above. On these modules H(G(F), I) acts via a central
character corresponding to a point in Spec Rep LG ⊗
C C[q, q−1], which is just

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
103
a pair (γ, q), where γ is a semi-simple conjugacy class in LG and q ∈C×. In
our situation q is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of F (hence a power of a
prime), but in what follows we will allow a larger range of possible values of q:
all non-zero complex numbers except for the roots of unity. Consider the quo-
tient of H(G(F), I) by the central character deﬁned by (γ, u). This is just the
algebra K
LG×C×(St), specialized at (γ, q). We denote it by K
LG×C×(St)(γ,q).
Now for a nilpotent element u ∈N consider the Springer ﬁber Spu. The
condition that γuγ−1 = qu means that u, and hence Spu, is stabilized by the
action of (γ, q) ∈LG×C× (see formula (8.7)). Let A be the smallest algebraic
subgroup of LG×C× containing (γ, q). The algebra K
LG×C×(St)(γ,q) naturally
acts on the equivariant K-theory KA(Spu) specialized at (γ, q),
KA(Spu)(γ,q) = KA(Spu)
⊗
Rep A C(γ,q).
It is known that KA(Spu)(γ,q) is isomorphic to the homology H•(Spγ
u) of the
γ-ﬁxed subset of Spu (see [KL, CG]). Thus, we obtain that KA(Spu)(γ,q) is a
module over H(G(F), I).
Unfortunately, these H(G(F), I)-modules are not irreducible in general,
and one needs to work harder to describe the irreducible modules over
H(G(F), I). For G = GLn one can show that each of these modules has
a unique irreducible quotient, and this way one recovers the bijection (8.4).
But for a general groups G the ﬁnite groups C(γ, u) come into play. Namely,
the group C(γ, u) acts on KA(Spu)(γ,q), and this action commutes with the
action of K
LG×C×(St)(γ,q). Therefore we have a decomposition
KA(Spu)(γ,q) =
$
ρ∈Irrep C(γ,u)
ρ ⊗KA(Spu)(γ,q,ρ),
of KA(Spu)(γ,q) as a representation of C(γ, u) × H(G(F), I). One shows (see
[KL, CG] for details) that each H(G(F), I)-module KA(Spu)(γ,q,ρ) has a
unique irreducible quotient, and this way one obtains a parameterization of
irreducible modules by the triples appearing in the left hand side of (8.6).
Therefore we obtain that the same set is in bijection with the right hand
side of (8.6). This is how the tame local Langlands correspondence (8.6), also
known as the Deligne–Langlands conjecture, is proved.
8.2 Categories Admitting (gκc, I) Harish-Chandra Modules
We now wish to ﬁnd categorical analogues of the above results in the frame-
work of the categorical Langlands correspondence for loop groups.
As we explained in Section 6.2, in the categorical setting a representation
of G(F) is replaced by a category gκc -modχ equipped with an action of G((t)),
and the space of I-invariant vectors is replaced by the subcategory of (gκc, I)
Harish-Chandra modules in gκc -modχ. Hence the analogue of the question

104
E. Frenkel
which representations of G(F) admit non-zero I-invariant vectors becomes
the following question: for what χ does the category gκc -modχ contain non-
zero (gκc, I) Harish-Chandra modules?
To answer this question, we introduce the space OpRS
LG(D) of opers with
regular singularity. By deﬁnition (see [BD1], Sect. 3.8.8), an element of this
space is an LN[[t]]-conjugacy class of operators of the form
(8.9)
∇= ∂t + t−1 (p−1 + v(t)) ,
where v(t) ∈
Lb[[t]]. One can show that a natural map OpRS
LG(D) →
OpLG(D×) is an embedding.
Following [BD1], we associate to an oper with regular singularity its
residue. For an operator (8.9) the residue is by deﬁnition equal to p−1+v(0).
Clearly, under gauge transformations by an element x(t) of LN[[t]] the residue
gets conjugated by x(0) ∈N. Therefore its projection onto
Lg/LG = Spec(Fun Lg)
LG = Spec(Fun Lh)W = h∗/W
is well-deﬁned.
Given µ ∈h∗, we write ϖ(µ) for the projection of µ onto h∗/W. Finally,
let P be the set of integral (not necessarily dominant) weights of g, viewed as
a subset of h∗. The next result follows from [F3, FG2].
Lemma 4. The categorygκc -modχ contains a non-zero (gκc, I) Harish-Chan-
dra module if and only if
(8.10)
χ ∈

ν∈P/W
OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(ν).
Thus, the opers χ for which the corresponding category gκc -modχ contain
non-trivial I-equivariant objects are precisely the points of the subscheme
(8.10) of OpLG(D×). The next question is what are the corresponding LG-
local systems.
Let LocRS,uni
LG
⊂LocLG(D×) be the locus of LG-local systems on D×
with regular singularity and unipotent monodromy. Such a local system is
determined, up to an isomorphism, by the conjugacy class of its monodromy
(see, e.g., [BV], Sect. 8). Therefore LocRS,uni
LG
is an algebraic stack isomorphic
to N/LG. The following result is proved in a way similar to the proof of
Lemma 2.
Lemma 5. If the local system underlying an oper χ ∈OpLG(D×) belongs to
LocRS,uni
LG
, then χ belongs to the subset (8.10) of OpLG(D×).
Indeed, the subscheme (8.10) is precisely the (set-theoretic) preimage of
LocRS,uni
LG
⊂LocLG(D×) under the map α : OpLG(D×) →LocLG(D×).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
105
This hardly comes as a surprise. Indeed, by analogy with the classical
Langlands correspondence we expect that the categories gκc -modχ contain-
ing non-trivial I-equivariant objects correspond to the Langlands parame-
ters which are the geometric counterparts of tamely ramiﬁed homomorphisms
W ′
F →LG. The most obvious candidates for those are precisely the LG-local
systems on D× with regular singularity and unipotent monodromy. For this
reason we will call such local systems tamely ramiﬁed.
Let us summarize: suppose that σ is a tamely ramiﬁed LG-local system
on D×, and let χ be a LG-oper that is in the gauge equivalence class of
σ. Then χ belongs to the subscheme (8.10), and the corresponding cate-
gory gκc -modχ contains non-zero I-equivariant objects, by Lemma 4. Let
gκc -modI
χ be the corresponding category of I-equivariant (or, equivalently,
(gκc, I) Harish-Chandra) modules. Note that according to Conjecture 2, the
categories gκc -modχ (resp., gκc -modI
χ) should be equivalent to each other for
all χ which are gauge equivalent to each other as LG-local systems.
In the next section, following [FG2], we will give a conjectural description
of the categories gκc -modI
χ for χ ∈OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(−ρ) in terms of the category
of coherent sheaves on the Springer ﬁber corresponding to the residue of χ.
This description in particular implies that at least the derived categories of
these categories are equivalent to each other for the opers corresponding to
the same local system. We have a similar conjecture for χ ∈OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(ν) for
other ν ∈P, which the reader may easily reconstruct from our discussion of
the case ν = −ρ.
8.3 Conjectural Description of the Categories of (gκc, I)
Harish-Chandra Modules
Let us consider one of the connected components of the subscheme (8.10),
namely, OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(−ρ). Here it will be convenient to use a diﬀerent realization
of this space, as the space Opnilp
LG of nilpotent opers introduced in [FG2].
By deﬁnition, an element of this space is an LN[[t]]-gauge equivalence class
of operators of the form
(8.11)
∇= ∂t + p−1 + v(t) + v
t ,
where v(t) ∈
Lb[[t]] and v ∈
Ln. It is shown in [FG2] that Opnilp
LG
≃
OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(−ρ). In particular, Opnilp
LG is a subspace of OpLG(D×).
We have the (secondary) residue map
Res : Opnilp
LG →LnFLB,0 = FLB,0 ×
LB
Ln,
sending a gauge equivalence class of operators (8.11) to v. By abuse of nota-
tion, we will denote the corresponding map
Opnilp
LG →Ln/LB = N/LG

106
E. Frenkel
also by Res.
For any χ ∈Opnilp
LG the LG-gauge equivalence class of the corresponding
connection is a tamely ramiﬁed LG-local system on D×. Moreover, its mon-
odromy conjugacy class is equal to exp(2πi Res(χ)).
We wish to describe the category gκc -modI
χ of (gκc, I) Harish-Chandra
modules with the central character χ ∈Opnilp
LG . However, here we face the ﬁrst
major complication as compared to the unramiﬁed case. While in the ramiﬁed
case we worked with the abelian category gκc -modG[[t]]
χ
, this does not seem to
be possible in the tamely ramiﬁed case. So from now on we will work with the
appropriate derived category Db(gκc -modχ)I. By deﬁnition, this is the full
subcategory of the bounded derived category Db(gκc -modχ) whose objects
are complexes with cohomologies in gκc -modI
χ.
Roughly speaking, the conjecture of [FG2] is that Db(gκc -modχ)I is equiv-
alent to Db(QCoh(SpRes(χ))), where QCoh(SpRes(χ)) is the category of quasi-
coherent sheaves on the Springer ﬁber of Res(χ). However, we need to make
some adjustments to this statement. These adjustments are needed to ar-
rive at a “nice” statement, Conjecture 6 below. We now explain what these
adjustments are the reasons behind them.
The ﬁrst adjustment is that we need to consider a slightly larger category
of representations than Db(gκc -modχ)I. Namely, we wish to include exten-
sions of I-equivariant gκc-modules which are not necessarily I-equivariant, but
only I0-equivariant, where I0 = [I, I]. To explain this more precisely, let us
choose a Cartan subgroup H ⊂B ⊂I and the corresponding Lie subalgebra
h ⊂b ⊂Lie I. We then have an isomorphism I = H ⋉I0. An I-equivariant
gκc-module is the same as a module on which h acts diagonally with eigenval-
ues given by integral weights and the Lie algebra Lie I0 acts locally nilpotently.
However, there may exist extensions between such modules on which the ac-
tion of h is no longer semi-simple. Such modules are called I-monodromic.
More precisely, an I-monodromic gκc-module is a module that admits an in-
creasing ﬁltration whose consecutive quotients are I-equivariant. It is natural
to include such modules in our category. However, it is easy to show that an
I-monodromic object of gκc -modχ is the same as an I0-equivariant object of
gκc -modχ for any χ ∈Opnilp
LG (see [FG2]). Therefore instead of I-monodromic
modules we will use I0-equivariant modules. Denote by Db(gκc -modχ)I0 the
the full subcategory of Db(gκc -modχ) whose objects are complexes with the
cohomologies in gκc -modI0
χ .
The second adjustment has to do with the non-ﬂatness of the Springer
resolution N →N. By deﬁnition, the Springer ﬁber Spu is the ﬁber product
N ×
N pt, where pt is the point u ∈N. This means that the structure sheaf of
Spu is given by
(8.12)
OSpu = O N ⊗
ON
C.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
107
However, because the morphism N →N is not ﬂat, this tensor product func-
tor is not left exact, and there are non-trivial higher derived tensor products
(the Tor’s). Our (conjectural) equivalence is not going to be an exact functor:
it sends a general object of the category gκc -modI0
χ not to an object of the
category of quasicoherent sheaves, but to a complex of sheaves, or, more pre-
cisely, an object of the corresponding derived category. Hence we are forced to
work with derived categories, and so the higher derived tensor products need
to be taken into account.
To understand better the consequences of this non-exactness, let us con-
sider the following model example. Suppose that we have established an
equivalence between the derived category Db(QCoh(N)) and another derived
category Db(C). In particular, this means that both categories carry an action
of the algebra Fun N (recall that N is an aﬃne algebraic variety). Let us sup-
pose that the action of Fun N on Db(C) comes from its action on the abelian
category C. Thus, C ﬁbers over N, and let Cu the ﬁber category corresponding
to u ∈N. This is the full subcategory of C whose objects are objects of C
on which the ideal of u in Fun N acts by 0.16 What is the category Db(Cu)
equivalent to?
It is tempting to say that it is equivalent to Db(QCoh(Spu). However,
this does not follow from the equivalence of Db(QCoh(N)) and Db(C) because
of the tensor product (8.12) having non-trivial higher derived functors. The
correct answer is that Db(Cu) is equivalent to the category Db(QCoh(SpDG
u ),
where SpDG
u
is the “DG ﬁber” of N →N at u. By deﬁnition, a quasicoherent
sheaf on SpDG
u
is a DG module over the DG algebra
(8.13)
OSpDG
u
= O N
L⊗
ON
Cu,
where we now take the full derived functor of tensor product. Thus, the cat-
egory Db(QCoh(SpDG
u )) may be thought of as the derived category of quasi-
coherent sheaves on the “DG scheme” SpDG
u
(see [CK] for a precise deﬁnition
of DG scheme).
Finally, the last adjustment is that we should consider the non-reduced
Springer ﬁbers. This means that instead of the Springer resolution N we should
consider the “thickened” Springer resolution
N = Lg ×
Lg N,
where Lg is the so-called Grothendieck alteration,
Lg = {x ∈Lg, b′ ∈LG/LB | x ∈b′}.
The variety N is non-reduced, and the underlying reduced variety is the
Springer resolution N. For instance, the ﬁber of N over a regular element
16 The relationship between C and Cu is similar to the relationship between gκc -mod
and and gκc -modχ, where χ ∈OpLG(D×).

E. Frenkel
in N consists of a single point, but the corresponding ﬁber of N is the spec-
trum of the Artinian ring h0 = Fun Lh/(Fun Lh)W
+ . Here (Fun Lh)W
+ is the
ideal in Fun Lh generated by the augmentation ideal of the subalgebra of W-
invariants. Thus, Spec h0 is the scheme-theoretic ﬁber of ϖ : Lh →Lh/W at
0. It turns out that in order to describe the category Db(gκc -modχ)I0 we need
to use the “thickened” Springer resolution.
Let us summarize: in order to construct the sought-after equivalence of
categories we take, instead of individual Springer ﬁbers, the whole Springer
resolution, and we further replace it by the “thickened” Springer resolution N
deﬁned above. In this version we will be able to formulate our equivalence in
such a way that we avoid DG schemes.
This means that instead of considering the categories gκc -modχ for in-
dividual nilpotent opers χ, we should consider the “universal” category
gκc -modnilp which is the “family version” of all of these categories. By de-
ﬁnition, the category gκc -modnilp is the full subcategory of gκc -mod whose
objects have the property that the action of Z(g) = Fun OpLG(D) on them
factors through the quotient Fun OpLG(D) →Fun Opnilp
LG . Thus, the category
gκc -modnilp is similar to the category gκc -modreg that we have considered
above. While the former ﬁbers over Opnilp
LG , the latter ﬁbers over OpLG(D).
The individual categories gκc -modχ are now realized as ﬁbers of these cate-
gories over particular opers χ.
Our naive idea was that for each χ ∈Opnilp
LG the category Db(gκc -modχ)I0
is equivalent to QCoh(SpRes(χ)). We would like to formulate now a “family
version” of such an equivalence. To this end we form the ﬁber product
Ln = Lg ×
Lg
Ln.
It turns out that this ﬁber product does not suﬀer from the problem of the
individual Springer ﬁbers, as the following lemma shows:
Lemma 6 ([FG2],Lemma 6.4). The derived tensor product
Fun Lg
L⊗
Fun Lg Fun Ln
is concentrated in cohomological dimension 0.
The variety Ln may be thought of as the family of (non-reduced) Springer
ﬁbers parameterized by Ln ⊂Lg. It is important to note that it is singular,
reducible and non-reduced. For example, if g = sl2, it has two components,
one of which is P1 (the Springer ﬁber at 0) and the other is the doubled aﬃne
line (i.e., Spec C[x, y]/(y2)).
We note that the corresponding reduced scheme is
(8.14)
Ln = N ×
N
Ln.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
109
However, the derived tensor product corresponding to (8.14) is not concen-
trated in cohomological dimension 0, and this is the reason why we prefer to
use Ln rather than Ln.
Now we set
MOpnilp
LG = Opnilp
LG
×
Ln/LB
Ln/LB,
where we use the residue morphism Res : Opnilp
LG →Ln/LB. Thus, informally
MOpnilp
LG may be thought as the family over Opnilp
LG whose ﬁber over χ ∈Opnilp
LG
is the (non-reduced) Springer ﬁber of Res(χ).
The space MOpnilp
LG is the space of Miura opers whose underlying opers
are nilpotent, introduced in [FG2].
We also introduce the category gκc -modI0
nilp which is a full subcategory of
gκc -modnilp whose objects are I0-equivariant. Let Db(gκc -modnilp)I0 be the
corresponding derived category.
Now we can formulate the Main Conjecture of [FG2]:
Conjecture 6. There is an equivalence of categories
(8.15)
Db(gκc -modnilp)I0 ≃Db(QCoh(MOpnilp
LG ))
which is compatible with the action of the algebra Fun Opnilp
LG on both cate-
gories.
Note that the action of Fun Opnilp
LG on the ﬁrst category comes from the
action of the center Z(g), and on the second category it comes from the fact
that MOpnilp
LG is a scheme over Opnilp
LG .
Another important remark is that the equivalence (8.15) does not preserve
the t-structures on the two categories. In other words, (8.15) is expected in
general to map objects of the abelian category gκc -modI0
nilp to complexes in
Db(QCoh(MOpnilp
LG )), and vice versa.
There are similar conjectures for the categories corresponding to the spaces
Opnilp,λ
LG
of nilpotent opers with dominant integral weights λ ∈P +.
In the next section we will discuss the connection between Conjecture 6
and the classical tamely ramiﬁed Langlands correspondence. We then present
some evidence for this conjecture.
8.4 Connection between the Classical and the Geometric Settings
Let us discuss the connection between the equivalence (8.15) and the real-
ization of representations of aﬃne Hecke algebras in terms of K-theory of
the Springer ﬁbers. As we have explained, we would like to view the cate-
gory Db(gκc -modχ)I0 for χ ∈Opnilp
LG as, roughly, a categoriﬁcation of the
space Rπ(I) of I-invariant vectors in an irreducible representation (R, π) of

110
E. Frenkel
G(F). Therefore, we expect that the Grothendieck group of the category
Db(gκc -modχ)I0 is somehow related to the space Rπ(I).
Let us try to specialize the statement of Conjecture 6 to a particular oper
χ = (F, ∇, FLB) ∈Opnilp
LG .
Let &
Sp
DG
Res(χ) be the DG ﬁber of MOpnilp
LG over χ. By deﬁnition (see Section 8.3),
the residue Res(χ) of χ is a vector in the twist of Ln by the LB-torsor FLB,0.
It follows that &
Sp
DG
Res(χ) is the DG ﬁber over Res(χ) of the FLB,0-twist of the
Grothendieck alteration.
If we trivialize FLB,0, then u = Res(χ) becomes an element of Ln. By
deﬁnition, the (non-reduced) DG Springer ﬁber &
Sp
DG
u
is the DG ﬁber of the
Grothendieck alteration Lg →Lg at u. In other words, the corresponding
structure sheaf is the DG algebra
O&
Sp
DG
u
= OLg
L⊗
OLg
Cu
(compare with formula (8.13)).
To see what these DG ﬁbers look like, let u = 0. Then the naive Springer
ﬁber is just the ﬂag variety LG/LB (it is reduced in this case), and O&
Sp0 is
the structure sheaf of LG/LB. But the sheaf O&
Sp
DG
0
is a sheaf of DG algebras,
which is quasi-isomorphic to the complex of diﬀerential forms on LG/LB, with
the zero diﬀerential. In other words, &
Sp
DG
0
may be viewed as a “Z-graded man-
ifold” such that the corresponding supermanifold, obtained by replacing the
Z-grading by the corresponding Z/2Z-grading, is ΠT(LG/LB), the tangent
bundle to LG/LB with the parity of the ﬁbers changed from even to odd.
We expect that the category gκc -modI0
nilp is ﬂat over Opnilp
LG . Therefore,
specializing Conjecture 6 to a particular oper χ ∈Opnilp
LG , we obtain as a
corollary an equivalence of categories
(8.16)
Db(gκc -modχ)I0 ≃Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
Res(χ))).
This bodes well with Conjecture 2 saying that the categories gκc -modχ1 and
gκc -modχ2 (and hence Db(gκc -modχ1)I0 and Db(gκc -modχ2)I0) should be
equivalent if the underlying local systems of the opers χ1 and χ2 are isomor-
phic. For nilpotent opers χ1 and χ2 this is so if and only if their monodromies
are conjugate to each other. Since their monodromies are obtained by expo-
nentiating their residues, this is equivalent to saying that the residues, Res(χ1)
and Res(χ2), are conjugate with respect to the FLB,0-twist of LG. But in this
case the DG Springer ﬁbers corresponding to χ1 and χ2 are also isomorphic,
and so Db(gκc -modχ1)I0 and Db(gκc -modχ2)I0 are equivalent to each other,
by (8.16).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
111
The Grothendieck group of the category Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
u )), where u is
any nilpotent element, is the same as the Grothendieck group of QCoh(Spu).
In other words, the Grothendieck group does not “know” about the DG or
the non-reduced structure of &
Sp
DG
u . Hence it is nothing but the algebraic
K-theory K(Spu). As we explained at the end of Section 8.1, equivariant
variants of this algebraic K-theory realize the “standard modules” over the
aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(F), I). Moreover, the spaces of I-invariant vectors
Rπ(I) as above, which are naturally modules over the aﬃne Hecke algebra, may
be realized as subquotients of K(Spu). This indicates that the equivalences
(8.16) and (8.15) are compatible with the classical results.
However, at ﬁrst glance there are some important diﬀerences between the
classical and the categorical pictures, which we now discuss in more detail.
In the construction of H(G(F), I)-modules outlined in Section 8.1 we had
to pick a semi-simple element γ of LG such that γuγ−1 = qu, where q is the
number of elements in the residue ﬁeld of F. Then we consider the specialized
A-equivariant K-theory KA(Spu)(γ,q) where A is the the smallest algebraic
subgroup of LG × C× containing (γ, q). This gives K(Spu) the structure of
an H(G(F), I)-module. But this module carries a residual symmetry with
respect to the group C(γ, u) of components of the centralizer of γ and u in
LG, which commutes with the action of H(G(F), I). Hence we consider the
H(G(F), I)-module
KA(Spu)(γ,q,ρ) = HomC(γ,u)(ρ, K(Spu)),
corresponding to an irreducible representation ρ of C(γ, u). Finally, each of
these components has a unique irreducible quotient, and this is an irreducible
representation of H(G(F), I) which is realized on the space Rπ(I), where (R, π)
is an irreducible representation of G(F) corresponding to (γ, u, ρ) under the
bijection (8.6). How is this intricate structure reﬂected in the categorical set-
ting?
Our category Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
u )), where u = Res(χ), is a particular cate-
goriﬁcation of the (non-equivariant) K-theory K(Spu). Note that in the clas-
sical local Langlands correspondence (8.6) the element u of the triple (γ, u, ρ)
is interpreted as the logarithm of the monodromy of the corresponding rep-
resentation of the Weil-Deligne group W ′
F . This is in agreement with the
interpretation of Res(χ) as the logarithm of the monodromy of the LG-local
system on D× corresponding to χ, which plays the role of the local Langlands
parameter for the category gκc -modχ (up to the inessential factor 2πi).
But what about the other parameters, γ and ρ? And why does our category
correspond to the non-equivariant K-theory of the Springer ﬁber, and not the
equivariant K-theory, as in the classical setting?
The element γ corresponding to the Frobenius in W ′
F does not seem to
have an analogue in the geometric setting. We have already seen this above in
the unramiﬁed case: while in the classical setting unramiﬁed local Langlands
parameters are the semi-simple conjugacy classes γ in LG, in the geometric

112
E. Frenkel
setting we have only one unramiﬁed local Langlands parameter, namely, the
trivial local system.
To understand better what’s going on here, we revisit the unramiﬁed case.
Recall that the spherical Hecke algebra H(G(F), K0) is isomorphic to the rep-
resentation ring Rep LG. The one-dimensional space of K0-invariants in an ir-
reducible unramiﬁed representation (R, π) of G(F) realizes a one-dimensional
representation of H(G(F), K0), i.e., a homomorphism Rep LG →C. The un-
ramiﬁed Langlands parameter γ of (R, π), which is a semi-simple conjugacy
class in LG, is the point in Spec(Rep LG) corresponding to this homomor-
phism. What is a categorical analogue of this homomorphism? The categori-
ﬁcation of Rep LG is the category Rep LG. The product structure on Rep LG
is reﬂected in the structure of tensor category on Rep LG. On the other hand,
the categoriﬁcation of the algebra C is the category Vect of vector spaces.
Therefore a categorical analogue of a homomorphism Rep LG →C is a func-
tor Rep LG →Vect respecting the tensor structures on both categories. Such
functors are called the ﬁber functors. The ﬁber functors form a category of
their own, which is equivalent to the category of LG-torsors. Thus, any two
ﬁber functors are isomorphic, but not canonically. In particular, the group of
automorphisms of each ﬁber functor is isomorphic to LG. (Incidentally, this
is how LG is reconstructed from a ﬁber functor in the Tannakian formalism.)
Thus, we see that while in the categorical world we do not have analogues of
semi-simple conjugacy classes γ (the points of Spec(Rep LG)), their role is in
some sense played by the group of automorphisms of a ﬁber functor.
This is reﬂected in the fact that while in the categorical setting we have a
unique unramiﬁed Langlands parameter, namely, the trivial LG-local system
σ0 on D×, this local system has a non-trivial group of automorphisms, namely,
LG. We therefore expect that the group LG should act by automorphisms
of the Langlands category Cσ0 corresponding to σ0, and this action should
commute with the action of the loop group G((t)) on Cσ0. It is this action
of LG that is meant to compensate for the lack of unramiﬁed Langlands
parameters, as compared to the classical setting.
We have argued in Section 7 that the category gκc -modχ, where χ =
(F, ∇, FLB) ∈OpLG(D), is a candidate for the Langlands category Cσ0. There-
fore we expect that the group LG (more precisely, its twist LGF) acts on the
category gκc -modχ. In Section 7.6 we showed how to obtain this action using
the conjectural equivalence between gκc -modχ and the category DHecke
κc
-modχ
of Hecke eigenmodules on the aﬃne Grassmannian Gr (see Conjecture 3). The
category DHecke
κc
-modχ was deﬁned in Section 7.5 as a “de-equivariantization”
of the category Dκc -mod of twisted D-modules on Gr with respect to the
monoidal action of the category Rep LG.
Now comes a crucial observation which will be useful for understanding
the way things work in the tamely ramiﬁed case: the category Rep LG may
be interpreted as the category of LG-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on the
variety pt = Spec C. In other words, Rep LG may be interpreted as the cate-
gory of quasicoherent sheaves on the stack pt /LG. The existence of monoidal

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
113
action of the category Rep LG on Dκc -mod should be viewed as the statement
that the category Dκc -mod “lives” over the stack pt /LG. The statement of
Conjecture 3 may then be interpreted as saying that
gκc -modχ ≃Dκc -mod
×
pt /LG pt .
In other words, if C is the conjectural Langlands category ﬁbering over the
stack LocLG(D×) of all LG-local systems on D×, then
Dκc -mod ≃C
×
LocLG(D×) pt /LG,
whereas
gκc -modχ ≃C
×
LocLG(D×) pt,
where the morphism pt →LocLG(D×) corresponds to the oper χ.
Thus, in the categorical setting there are two diﬀerent ways to think about
the trivial local system σ0: as a point (deﬁned by a particular LG-bundle on
D with connection, such as a regular oper χ), or as a stack pt /LG. The
base change of the Langlands category in the ﬁrst case gives us a category
with an action of LG, such as the categories gκc -modχ or DHecke
κc
-mod. The
base change in the second case gives us a category with a monoidal ac-
tion of Rep LG, such as the category Dκc -mod. We can go back and forth
between the two by applying the procedures of equivariantization and de-
equivariantization with respect to LG and Rep LG, respectively.
Now we return to the tamely ramiﬁed case. The semi-simple element γ ap-
pearing in the triple (γ, u, ρ) plays the same role as the unramiﬁed Langlands
parameter γ. However, now it must satisfy the identity γuγ−1 = qu. Recall
that the center Z of H(G(F), I) is isomorphic to Rep LG, and so Spec Z is
the set of all semi-simple elements in LG. For a ﬁxed nilpotent element u the
equation γuγ−1 = qu cuts out a locus Cu in Spec Z corresponding to those
central characters which may occur on irreducible H(G(F), I)-modules corre-
sponding to u. In the categorical setting (where we set q = 1) the analogue of
Cu is the centralizer Z(u) of u in LG, which is precisely the group Aut(σ) of
automorphisms of a tame local system σ on D× with monodromy exp(2πiu).
On general grounds we expect that the group Aut(σ) acts on the Langlands
category Cσ, just as we expect the group LG of automorphisms of the trivial
local system σ0 to act on the category Cσ0. It is this action that replaces the
parameter γ in the geometric setting.
In the classical setting we also have one more parameter, ρ. Let us recall
that ρ is a representation of the group C(γ, u) of connected components of the
centralizer Z(γ, u) of γ and u. But the group Z(γ, u) is a subgroup of Z(u),
which becomes the group Aut(σ) in the geometric setting. Therefore one can
argue that the parameter ρ is also absorbed into the action of Aut(σ) on the
category Cσ.

114
E. Frenkel
If we have an action of Aut(σ) on the category Cσ, or on one of its many
incarnations gκc -modχ, χ ∈Opnilp
LG , it means that these categories must be
“de-equivariantized”, just like the categories gκc -modχ, χ ∈OpLG(D), in the
unramiﬁed case. This is the reason why in the equivalence (8.16) (and in
Conjecture 6) we have the non-equivariant categories of quasicoherent sheaves
(whose Grothendieck groups correspond to the non-equivariant K-theory of
the Springer ﬁbers).
However, there is also an equivariant version of these categories. Consider
the substack of tamely ramiﬁed local systems in LocLG(D×) introduced in
Section 8.2. Since a tamely ramiﬁed local system is completely determined by
the logarithm of its (unipotent) monodromy, this substack is isomorphic to
N/LG. This substack plays the role of the substack pt /LG corresponding to
the trivial local system. Let us set
Ctame = C
×
LocLG(D×) N/LG.
Then, according to our general conjecture expressed by the Cartesian diagram
(5.3), we expect to have
(8.17)
gκc -modnilp ≃Ctame
×
N/LG Opnilp
LG .
Let Db(Ctame)I0 be the I0-equivariant derived category corresponding to
Ctame. Combining (8.17) with Conjecture 6, and noting that
MOpnilp
LG ≃Opnilp
LG
×
N/LG
N/LG,
we obtain the following conjecture (see [FG2]):
(8.18)
Db(Ctame)I0 ≃Db(QCoh(N/LG)).
The category on the right hand side may be interpreted as the derived cat-
egory of LG-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on the “thickened” Springer
resolution N.
Together, the conjectural equivalences (8.16) and (8.18) should be thought
of as the categorical versions of the realizations of modules over the aﬃne
Hecke algebra in the K-theory of the Springer ﬁbers.
One corollary of the equivalence (8.16) is the following: the classes of ir-
reducible objects of the category gκc -modI0
χ in the Grothendieck group of
gκc -modI0
χ
give rise to a basis in the algebraic K-theory K(Spu), where
u = Res(χ). Presumably, this basis is closely related to the bases in (equivari-
ant version of) this K-theory constructed by G. Lusztig in [Lu2] (from the
perspective of unrestricted g-modules in positive characteristic).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program

8.5 Evidence for the Conjecture
We now describe some evidence for Conjecture 6. It consists of the following
four groups of results:
•
Interpretation of the Wakimoto modules as gκc-modules corresponding to
the skyscraper sheaves on MOpnilp
LG ;
•
Connection to R. Bezrukavnikov’s theory;
•
Proof of the equivalence of certain quotient categories of Db(gκc -modnilp)I0
and Db(QCoh(MOpnilp
LG )), [FG2].
•
Proof of the restriction of the equivalence (8.15) to regular opers, [FG4].
We start with the discussion of Wakimoto modules.
Suppose that we have proved the equivalence of categories (8.15). Then
each quasicoherent sheaf on MOpnilp
LG should correspond to an object of the
derived category Db(gκc -modnilp)I0. The simplest quasicoherent sheaves on
MOpnilp
LG are the skyscraper sheaves supported at the C-points of MOpnilp
LG .
It follows from the deﬁnition that a C-point of MOpnilp
LG , which is the same as a
C-point of the reduced scheme MOp0
G, is a pair (χ, b′), where χ = (F, ∇, FLB)
is a nilpotent LG-oper in Opnilp
LG and b′ is a point of the Springer ﬁber cor-
responding to Res(χ), which is the variety of Borel subalgebras in LgF0 that
contain Res(χ). Thus, if Conjecture 6 is true, we should have a family of ob-
jects of the category Db(gκc -modnilp)I0 parameterized by these data. What
are these objects?
The answer is that these are the Wakimoto modules. These modules
were originally introduced by M. Wakimoto [Wak] for g = sl2 and by B.
Feigin and myself in general in [FF1, FF2] (see also [F3]). We recall from
[F3] that Wakimoto modules of critical level are parameterized by the space
Conn(Ω−ρ)D× of connections on the LH-bundle Ω−ρ over D×. This is the
push-forward of the C×-bundle corresponding to the canonical line bundle
Ωwith respect to the homomorphism ρ : C× →LH. Let us denote the
Wakimoto module corresponding to ∇∈Conn(Ω−ρ)D× by W∇. According
to [F3], Theorem 12.6, the center Z(g) acts on W∇via the central character
µ(∇), where
µ : Conn(Ω−ρ)D× →OpLG(D×)
is the Miura transformation.
It is not diﬃcult to show that if χ ∈Opnilp
LG , then W∇is an object of the cat-
egory gκc -modI
χ for any ∇∈µ−1(χ). Now, according to the results presented
in [FG2], the points of the ﬁber µ−1(χ) of the Miura transformation over χ
are in bijection with the points of the Springer ﬁber SpRes(χ) corresponding
to the nilpotent element Res(χ). Therefore to each point of SpRes(χ) we may
assign a Wakimoto module, which is an object of the category gκc -modI0
χ (and
hence of the corresponding derived category). In other words, Wakimoto mod-
ules are objects of the category gκc -modI
nilp parameterized by the C-points

116
E. Frenkel
of MOpnilp
LG . It is natural to assume that they correspond to the skyscraper
sheaves on MOpnilp
LG under the equivalence (8.15). This was in fact one of our
motivations for this conjecture.
Incidentally, this gives us a glimpse into how the group of automorphisms
of the LG-local system underlying the oper χ acts on the category gκc -modχ.
This group is Z(Res(χ)), the centralizer of the residue Res(χ), and it acts
on the Springer ﬁber SpRes(χ). Therefore g ∈Z(Res(χ)) sends the skyscraper
sheaf supported at a point p ∈SpRes(χ) to the skyscraper sheaf supported at
g · p. Thus, we expect that g sends the Wakimoto module corresponding to p
to the Wakimoto module corresponding to g · p.
If the Wakimoto modules indeed correspond to the skyscraper sheaves,
then the equivalence (8.15) may be thought of as a kind of “spectral decom-
position” of the category Db(gκc -modnilp)I0, with the basic objects being the
Wakimoto modules W∇, where ∇runs over the locus in Conn(Ω−ρ)D× which
is isomorphic, pointwise, to MOpnilp
LG (see [FG5] for more details).
Now we discuss the second piece of evidence, connection with Bezrukanikov’s
theory.
To motivate it, let us recall that in Section 7.4 we discussed the action of
the categorical spherical algebra H(G((t)), G[[t]]) on the category gκc -modχ,
where χ is a regular oper. The aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(F), I) also has a
categorical analogue. Consider the aﬃne ﬂag variety Fl = G((t))/I. The
categorical Hecke algebra is the category H(G((t)), I) which is the full subcat-
egory of the derived category of D-modules on Fl = G((t))/I whose objects
are complexes with I-equivariant cohomologies. This category naturally acts
on the derived category Db(gκc -modχ)I. What does this action correspond to
on the other side of the equivalence (8.15)?
The answer is given by a theorem of R. Bezrukavnikov [Bez2], which may
be viewed as a categoriﬁcation of the isomorphism (8.8):
(8.19)
Db(DFl
κc -mod)I0 ≃Db(QCoh( St)),
where DFl
κc -mod is the category of twisted D-modules on Fl and St is the
“thickened” Steinberg variety
St = N ×
N
N = N ×
Lg
Lg.
Morally, we expect that the two categories in (8.19) act on the two cate-
gories in (8.15) in a compatible way. However, strictly speaking, the left hand
side of (8.19) acts like this:
Db(gκc -modnilp)I →Db(gκc -modnilp)I0,
and the right hand side of (8.19) acts like this:
Db(QCoh(MOp0
LG)) →Db(QCoh(MOpnilp
LG )).

So one needs a more precise statement, which may be found in [Bez2], Sect.
4.2. Alternatively, one can consider the corresponding actions of the aﬃne
braid group of LG, as in [Bez2].
A special case of this compatibility concerns some special objects of the
category Db(DFl
κc -mod)I, the central sheaves introduced in [Ga1]. They corre-
spond to the central elements of the aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(F), I). These
central elements act as scalars on irreducible H(G(F), I)-modules, as well as
on the standard modules KA(Spu)(γ,q,ρ) discussed above. We have argued
that the categories gκc -modI0
χ , χ ∈Opnilp
LG , are categorical versions of these
representations. Therefore it is natural to expect that its objects are “eigen-
modules” with respect to the action of the central sheaves from Db(DFl
κc -mod)I
(in the sense of Section 7.4). This has indeed been proved in [FG3].
This discussion indicates an intimate connection between the category
Db(gκc -modnilp) and the category of twisted D-modules on the aﬃne ﬂag
variety, which is similar to the connection between gκc -modreg and the
category of twisted D-modules on the aﬃne Grassmannian which we dis-
cussed in Section 7.5. A more precise conjecture relating Db(gκc -modnilp)
and Db(DFl
κc -mod) was formulated in [FG2] (see the Introduction and Sect.
6), where we refer the reader for more details. This conjecture may be viewed
as an analogue of Conjecture 3 for nilpotent opers. As explained in [FG2], this
conjecture is supported by the results of [AB, ABG] (see also [Bez1, Bez2]).
Together, these results and conjectures provide additional evidence for the
equivalence (8.15).
9 Ramiﬁed Global Langlands Correspondence
We now discuss the implications of the local Langlands correspondence for
the global geometric Langlands correspondence.
We begin by brieﬂy discussing the setting of the classical global Langlands
correspondence.
9.1 The Classical Setting
Let X be a smooth projective curve over Fq. Denote by F the ﬁeld Fq(X)
of rational functions on X. For any closed point x of X we denote by Fx
the completion of F at x and by Ox its ring of integers. If we choose a local
coordinate tx at x (i.e., a rational function on X which vanishes at x to order
one), then we obtain isomorphisms Fx ≃Fqx((tx)) and Ox ≃Fqx[[tx]], where
Fqx is the residue ﬁeld of x; in general, it is a ﬁnite extension of Fq containing
qx = qordx elements.
Thus, we now have a local ﬁeld attached to each point of X. The ring
A = AF of ad`eles of F is by deﬁnition the restricted product of the ﬁelds Fx,
where x runs over the set |X| of all closed points of X. The word “restricted”

118
E. Frenkel
means that we consider only the collections (fx)x∈|X| of elements of Fx in
which fx ∈Ox for all but ﬁnitely many x. The ring A contains the ﬁeld F,
which is embedded into A diagonally, by taking the expansions of rational
functions on X at all points.
While in the local Langlands correspondence we considered irreducible
smooth representations of the group GLn over a local ﬁeld, in the global
Langlands correspondence we consider irreducible automorphic represen-
tations of the group GLn(A). The word “automorphic” means, roughly, that
the representation may be realized in a reasonable space of functions on the
quotient GLn(F)\GLn(A) (on which the group GLn(A) acts from the right).
On the other side of the correspondence we consider n-dimensional repre-
sentations of the Galois group Gal(F/F), or, more precisely, the Weil group
WF , which is a subgroup of Gal(F/F) deﬁned in the same way as in the local
case.
Roughly speaking, the global Langlands correspondence is a bijection be-
tween the set of equivalence classes of n-dimensional representations of WF
and the set of equivalence classes of irreducible automorphic representations
of GLn(A):
n-dimensional representations
of WF
⇐⇒
irreducible automorphic
representations of GLn(A)
The precise statement is more subtle. For example, we should consider the
so-called ℓ-adic representations of the Weil group (while in the local case we
considered the admissible complex representations of the Weil-Deligne group;
the reason is that in the local case those are equivalent to the ℓ-adic represen-
tations). Moreover, under this correspondence important invariants attached
to the objects appearing on both sides (Frobenius eigenvalues on the Galois
side and the Hecke eigenvalues on the other side) are supposed to match. We
refer the reader to Part I of the review [F6] for more details.
The global Langlands correspondence has been proved for GL2 in the 80’s
by V. Drinfeld [Dr1]–[Dr4] and more recently by L. Laﬀorgue [Laf] for GLn
with an arbitrary n.
Like in the local story, we may also wish to replace the group GLn by
an arbitrary reductive algebraic group deﬁned over F. Then on one side of
the global Langlands correspondence we have homomorphisms σ : WF →LG
satisfying some properties (or perhaps, some more reﬁned data, as in [A]).
We expect to be able to attach to each σ an automorphic representa-
tion π of GLn(AF ).17 The word “automorphic” again means, roughly, that
the representation may be realized in a reasonable space of functions on the
17 In this section, by abuse of notation, we will use the same symbol to denote a
representation of the group and the vector space underlying this representation.

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
119
quotient GLn(F)\GLn(A) (on which the group GLn(A) acts from the right).
We will not try to make this precise. In general, we expect not one but sev-
eral automorphic representations assigned to σ which are the global analogues
of the L-packets discussed above (see [A]). Another complication is that the
multiplicity of a given irreducible automorphic representation in the space of
functions on GLn(F)\GLn(A) may be greater than one. We will mostly ignore
all of these issues here, as our main interest is in the geometric theory (note
also that these issues do not arise if G = GLn).
An irreducible automorphic representation may always be decomposed as
the restricted tensor product 0′
x∈X πx, where each πx is an irreducible repre-
sentation of G(Fx). Moreover, for all by ﬁnitely many x ∈X the factor πx is
an unramiﬁed representation of G(Fx): it contains a non-zero vector invari-
ant under the maximal compact subgroup K0,x = G(Ox) (see Section 7.1).
Let us choose such a vector vx ∈πx (it is unique up to a scalar). The word
“restricted” means that we consider the span of vectors of the form ⊗x∈Xux,
where ux ∈πx and ux = vx for all but ﬁnitely many x ∈X.
An important property of the global Langlands correspondence is its com-
patibility with the local one. We can embed the Weil group WFx of each of
the local ﬁelds Fx into the global Weil group WF . Such an embedding is not
unique, but it is well-deﬁned up to conjugation in WF . Therefore an equiva-
lence class of σ : WF →LG gives rise to a well-deﬁned equivalence class of
σx : WFx →LG. We will impose the condition on σ that for all but ﬁnitely
many x ∈X the homomorphism σx is unramiﬁed (see Section 7.1).
By the local Langlands correspondence, to σx one can attach an equiva-
lence class of irreducible smooth representations πx of G(Fx).18 Moreover, an
unramiﬁed σx will correspond to an unramiﬁed irreducible representation πx.
The compatibility between local and global correspondences is the statement
that the automorphic representation of G(A) corresponding to σ should be
isomorphic to the restricted tensor product 0′
x∈X πx. Schematically, this is
represented as follows:
σ
global
←→π =
1
x∈X
′πx
σx
local
←→πx.
In this section we discuss an analogue of this local-to-global principle in
the geometric setting and the implications of our local results and conjectures
for the global geometric Langlands correspondence. We focus in particular on
the unramiﬁed and tamely ramiﬁed Langlands parameters. At the end of the
section we also discuss connections with irregular singularities.
18 Here we are considering ℓ-adic homomorphisms from the Weil group WFx to LG,
and therefore we do not need to pass from the Weil group to the Weil-Deligne
group.

9.2 The Unramiﬁed Case, Revisited
An important special case is when σ : WF →LG is everywhere unramiﬁed.
Then for each x ∈X the corresponding homomorphism σx : WFx →LG is
unramiﬁed, and hence corresponds, as explained in Section 7.1, to a semi-
simple conjugacy class γx in LG, which is the image of the Frobenius element
under σx. This conjugacy class in turn gives rise to an unramiﬁed irreducible
representation πx of G(Fx) with a unique, up to a scalar, vector vx such that
G(Ox)vx = vx. The spherical Hecke algebra H(G(Fx), G(Ox)) ≃Rep LG acts
on this vector according to formula (7.5):
(9.1)
HV,x ⋆vx = Tr(γx, V )vx,
[V ] ∈Rep LG.
The tensor product v = ⊗x∈Xvx of this vectors is a G(O)-invariant vec-
tor in π = 0′
x∈X πx, which, according to the global Langlands conjecture
is automorphic. This means that π is realized in the space of functions
on G(F)\G(AF ). In this realization vector v corresponds to a right G(O)-
invariant function on G(F)\G(AF ), or equivalently, a function on the double
quotient
(9.2)
G(F)\G(AF )/G(O).
Thus, an unramiﬁed global Langlands parameter σ gives rise to a function
on (9.2). This function is the automorphic function corresponding to σ.
We denote it by fπ. Since it corresponds to a vector in an irreducible repre-
sentation π of G(AF ), the entire representation π may be reconstructed from
this function. Thus, we do not lose any information by passing from π to fπ.
Since v ∈π is an eigenvector of the Hecke operators, according to formula
(9.1), we obtain that the function fπ is a Hecke eigenfunction on the double
quotient (9.2). In fact, the local Hecke algebras H(G(Fx), G(Ox)) act naturally
(from the right) on the space of functions on (9.2), and fπ is an eigenfunction
of this action. It satisﬁes the same property (9.1).
To summarize, the unramiﬁed global Langlands correspondence in the clas-
sical setting may be viewed as a correspondence between unramiﬁed homomor-
phisms σ : WF →LG and Hecke eigenfunctions on (9.2) (some irreducibility
condition on σ needs to be added to make this more precise, but we will ignore
this).
What should be the geometric analogue of this correspondence, when X
is a complex algebraic curve?
As explained in Section 3.1, the geometric analogue of an unramiﬁed ho-
momorphism WF →LG is a homomorphism π1(X) →LG, or equivalently,
since X is assumed to be compact, a holomorphic LG-bundle on X with a
holomorphic connection (it automatically gives rise to a ﬂat connection). The
global geometric Langlands correspondence should therefore associate to a
ﬂat holomorphic LG-bundle on X a geometric object on a geometric version
of the double quotient (9.2). As we argued in Section 3.3, this should be a
D-module on an algebraic variety whose set of points is (9.2).

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
121
Now, it is known that (9.2) is in bijection with the set of isomorphism
classes of G-bundles on X. This key result is due to A. Weil (see, e.g., [F6],
Sect. 3.2). This suggests that (9.2) is the set of points of the moduli space
of G-bundles on X. Unfortunately, in general this is not an algebraic variety,
but an algebraic stack, which locally looks like the quotient of an algebraic
variety by an action of an algebraic group. We denote it by BunG. The theory
of D-modules has been developed in the setting of algebraic stacks like BunG
in [BD1], and so we can use it for our purposes. Thus, we would like to attach
to a ﬂat holomorphic LG-bundle E on X a D-module AutE on BunG. This
D-module should satisfy an analogue of the Hecke eigenfunction condition,
which makes it into a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue E. This notion is
spelled out in [F6], Sect. 6.1 (following [BD1]), where we refer the reader for
details.
This brings us to the following question:
How to relate this global correspondence to the local geometric Langlands cor-
respondence discussed above?
As we have already seen in Section 1, the key element in answering this
question is a localization functor ∆κc,x from (gκc,x, G(Ox))-modules to
(twisted) D-modules on BunG. In Section 1 we have applied this functor
to the object V0(χx) of the Harish-Chandra category gκc,x -modG(Ox)
χx
, where
χx ∈OpLG(Dx). For an oper χx which extends from Dx to the entire curve X
we have obtained this way the Hecke eigensheaf associated to the underlying
LG-local system (see Theorem 1).
For a LG-local system E = (F, ∇) on X which does not admit the structure
of a regular oper on X, the above construction may be modiﬁed as follows (see
the discussion in [F6], Sect. 9.6, based on an unpublished work of Beilinson
and Drinfeld). In this case one can choose an LB-reduction FLB satisfying the
oper condition away from a ﬁnite set of points y1, . . . , yn and such that the
restriction χyi of the corresponding oper χ on X\{y1, . . . , yn} to D×
yi belongs
to Opλi
LG(Dyi) ⊂OpLG(D×
yi) for some λi ∈P +. Then one can construct a
Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to E by applying a multi-point version of the
localization functor to the tensor product of the quotients Vλi(χyi) of the
Weyl modules Vλi,yi (see [F6], Sect. 9.6).
The main lesson of this construction is that in the geometric setting the
localization functor gives us a powerful tool for converting local Langlands cat-
egories, such as gκc,x -modG(Ox)
χx
, into global categories of Hecke eigensheaves.
The category gκc,x -modG(Ox)
χx
turns out to be very simple: it has a unique
irreducible object, V0(χx). That is why it is suﬃcient to consider its image
under the localization functor, which turns out to be the desired Hecke eigen-
sheaf AutEχ. For general opers, with ramiﬁcation, the corresponding local
categories are more complicated, as we have seen above, and so are the corre-
sponding categories of Hecke eigensheaves. We will consider examples of these
categories in the next section.

9.3 Classical Langlands Correspondence with Ramiﬁcation
Let us ﬁrst consider ramiﬁed global Langlands correspondence in the clas-
sical setting. Suppose that we are given a homomorphism σ : WF →LG
that is ramiﬁed at ﬁnitely many points y1, . . . , yn of X. Then we expect
that to such σ corresponds an automorphic representation 0′
x∈X πx (more
precisely, an L-packet of representations). Here πx is still unramiﬁed for all
x ∈X\{y1, . . . , yn}, but is ramiﬁed at y1, . . . , yn, i.e., the space of G(Oyi)-
invariant vectors in πyi is zero. In particular, consider the special case when
each σyi : WFyi →LG is tamely ramiﬁed (see Section 8.1 for the deﬁnition).
Then, according to the results presented in Section 8.1, the corresponding
L-packet of representations of G(Fyi) contains an irreducible representation
πyi with non-zero invariant vectors with respect to the Iwahori subgroup Iyi.
Let us choose such a representation for each point yi.
Consider the subspace
(9.3)
n
1
i=1
π
Iyi
yi ⊗
1
x̸=yi
vx ⊂
1
x∈X
′πx,
where vx is a G(Ox)-vector in πx, x ̸= yi, i = 1, . . . , n. Then, because 0′
x∈X πx
is realized in the space of functions on G(F)\G(AF ), we obtain that the
subspace (9.3) is realized in the space of functions on the double quotient
(9.4)
G(F)\G(AF )/
n

i=1
Iyi ×

x̸=yi
G(Ox).
The spherical Hecke algebras H(G(Fx), G(Ox)), x ̸= yi, act on the sub-
space (9.3), and all elements of (9.3) are eigenfunctions of these algebras
(they satisfy formula (9.1)). At the points yi we have, instead of the action
of the commutative spherical Hecke algebra H(G(Fyi), G(Oyi), the action of
the non-commutative aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(Fyi), Iyi). Thus, we obtain a
subspace of the space of functions on (9.4), which consists of Hecke eigenfunc-
tions with respect to the spherical Hecke algebras H(G(Fx), G(Ox)), x ̸= yi,
and which realize a module over 0n
i=1 H(G(Fyi), Iyi) (which is irreducible,
since each πyi is irreducible).
This subspace encapsulates the automorphic representation 0′
x∈X πx the
way the automorphic function fπ encapsulates an unramiﬁed automorphic
representation. The diﬀerence is that in the unramiﬁed case the function fπ
spans the one-dimensional space of invariants of the maximal compact sub-
group G(O) in 0′
x∈X πx, whereas in the tamely ramiﬁed case the subspace
(9.3) is in general a multi-dimensional vector space.
9.4 Geometric Langlands Correspondence in the Tamely Ramiﬁed
Case
Now let us see how this plays out in the geometric setting. As we discussed
before, the analogue of a homomorphism σ : WF →LG tamely ramiﬁed at the

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
123
points y1, . . . , yn ∈X is now a local system E = (F, ∇), where F a LG-bundle
F on X with a connection ∇that has regular singularities at y1, . . . , yn and
unipotent monodromies around these points. We will call such a local system
tamely ramiﬁed at y1, . . . , yn. What should the global geometric Langlands
correspondence attach to such a local system? It is clear that we need to ﬁnd
a geometric object replacing the ﬁnite-dimensional vector space (9.3) realized
in the space of functions on (9.4).
Just as (9.2) is the set of points of the moduli stack BunG of G-bundles,
the double quotient (9.4) is the set of points of the moduli stack BunG,(yi) of
G-bundles on X with the parabolic structures at yi, i = 1, . . . , n. By deﬁni-
tion, a parabolic structure of a G-bundle P at y ∈X is a reduction of the ﬁber
Py of P at y to a Borel subgroup B ⊂G. Therefore, as before, we obtain that
a proper replacement for (9.3) is a category of D-modules on BunG,(yi). As in
the unramiﬁed case, we have the notion of a Hecke eigensheaf on BunG,(yi).
But because the Hecke functors are now deﬁned using the Hecke correspon-
dences over X\{y1, . . . , yn} (and not over X as before), an “eigenvalue” of the
Hecke operators is now an LG-local system on X\{y1, . . . , yn} (rather than
on X). Thus, we obtain that the global geometric Langlands correspondence
now should assign to a LG-local system E on X, tamely ramiﬁed at the points
y1, . . . , yn, a category AutE of D-modules on BunG,(yi) with the eigenvalue
E|X\{y1,...,yn},
E →AutE.
We now construct these categories using a generalization of the localization
functor we used in the unramiﬁed case (see [FG2]). For the sake of notational
simplicity, let us assume that our LG-local system E = (F, ∇) is tamely
ramiﬁed at a single point y ∈X. Suppose that this local system on X\y
admits the structure of a LG-oper χ = (F, ∇, FLB) whose restriction χy to
the punctured disc D×
y belongs to the subspace Opnilp
LG (Dy) of nilpotent LG-
opers.
For a simple Lie group G, the moduli stack BunG,y has a realization anal-
ogous to (1.1):
BunG,y ≃Gout\G(Ky)/Iy.
Let Dκc,Iy be the sheaf of twisted diﬀerential operators on BunG,y acting on
the line bundle corresponding to the critical level (it is the pull-back of the
square root of the canonical line bundle K1/2 on BunG under the natural
projection BunG,y →BunG). Applying the formalism of the previous section,
we obtain a localization functor
∆κc,Iy : gκc,y -modIy →Dκc,Iy -mod .
However, in order to make contact with the results obtained above we also
consider the larger category gκc,y -modI0
y of I0
y-equivariant modules, where
I0
y = [Iy, Iy].
Set

124
E. Frenkel
Bun′
G,y = Gout\G(Ky)/I0
y,
and let Dκc,I0y be the sheaf of twisted diﬀerential operators on Bun′
G,y act-
ing on the pull-back of the line bundle K1/2 on BunG. Let Dκc,I0
y -mod be
the category of Dκc,I0
y-modules. Applying the general formalism, we obtain a
localization functor
(9.5)
∆κc,I0
y : gκc,y -modI0
y →Dκc,I0
y -mod .
We note that a version of the categorical aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(Ky), Iy)
discussed in Section 8.5 naturally acts on the derived categories of the above
categories, and the functors ∆κc,Iy and ∆κc,I0
y intertwine these actions. Equiv-
alently, one can say that this functor intertwines the corresponding actions of
the aﬃne braid group associated to LG on the two categories (as in [Bez2]).
We now restrict the functors ∆κc,Iy and ∆κc,I0
y to the subcategories
gκc,y -modIy
χy and gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy, respectively. By using the same argument as
in [BD1], we obtain the following analogue of Theorem 1.
Theorem 5. Fix χy ∈Opnilp
LG (Dy) and let M be an object of the category
gκc,y -modIy
χy (resp. gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy). Then
(1) ∆κc,Iy(M) = 0 (resp., ∆κc,I0
y(M) = 0) unless χy is the restriction of
a regular oper χ = (F, ∇, FLB) on X\y to D×
y .
(2) In that case ∆κc,y(M) (resp., ∆κc,I0
y(M)) is a Hecke eigensheaf with
the eigenvalue Eχ = (F, ∇).
Thus, we obtain that if χy = χ|D×
y , then the image of any object of
gκc,y -modIy
χy under the functor ∆κc,Iy belongs to the category AutIy
Eχ of Hecke
eigensheaves on BunG,y. Now consider the restriction of the functor ∆κc,I0y to
gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy. As discussed in Section 8.3, the category gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy coincides
with the corresponding category gκc,y -modIy,m
χy
of Iy-monodromic modules.
Therefore the image of any object of gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy under the functor ∆κc,I0
y
belongs to the subcategory Dm
κc,I0
y -mod of Dκc,I0
y -mod whose objects admit
an increasing ﬁltration such that the consecutive quotients are pull-backs of
Dκc,Iy-modules from BunG,y. Such Dκc,I0
y–modules are called monodromic.
Let AutIy,m
Eχ
be the subcategory of Dm
κc,I0
y -mod whose objects are Hecke
eigensheaves with eigenvalue Eχ.
Thus, we obtain the functors
(9.6) ∆κc,Iy : gκc,y -modIy
χy →AutIy
Eχ,
∆κc,I0
y : gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy →AutIy,m
Eχ
It is tempting to conjecture (see [FG2]) that these functors are equivalences
of categories, at least for generic χ. Suppose that this is true. Then we may
identify the global categories AutIy
Eχ and AutIy,m
Eχ
of Hecke eigensheaves on

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
125
BunG,Iy and Bun′
G,I0
y with the local categories gκc,y -modIy
χy and gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy,
respectively. Therefore we can use our results and conjectures on the local
Langlands categories, such as gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy, to describe the global categories
of Hecke eigensheaves on the moduli stacks of G-bundles on X with parabolic
structures.
We have the following conjectural description of the derived category of
I0
y-equivariant modules, Db(gκc,y -modχy)I0
y (see formula (8.16)):
(9.7)
Db(gκc,y -modχy)I0
y ≃Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
Res(χy))).
The corresponding Iy-equivariant version is
(9.8)
Db(gκc,y -modχy)Iy ≃Db(QCoh(SpDG
Res(χy))),
where we replace the non-reduced DG Springer ﬁber by the reduced one: it is
deﬁned as the DG ﬁber of the morphism N →g over u.
If the functors (9.6) are equivalences, then by combining them with (9.7)
and (9.8), we obtain the following conjectural equivalences of categories:
(9.9)
Db(AutIy
Eχ) ≃Db(QCoh(SpDG
Res(χy))),
Db(AutIy,m
Eχ ) ≃Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
Res(χy))).
In other words, the derived category of a global Langlands category (mon-
odromic or not) corresponding to a local system tamely ramiﬁed at y ∈X
is equivalent to the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves on the DG
Springer ﬁber of its residue at y (non-reduced or reduced).
Again, these equivalences are supposed to intertwine the natural actions
on the above categories of the categorical aﬃne Hecke algebra H(G(Ky), Iy)
(or, equivalently, the aﬃne braid group associated to LG).
The categories appearing in (9.9) actually make sense for an arbitrary
LG-local system E on X tamely ramiﬁed at y. It is therefore tempting to
conjecture that these equivalences still hold in general:
(9.10)
Db(AutIy
E ) ≃Db(QCoh(SpDG
Res(E))),
Db(AutIy,m
E
) ≃Db(QCoh(&
Sp
DG
Res(E))).
The corresponding localization functors are constructed as follows: we repre-
sent a general local system E on X with tame ramiﬁcation at y by an oper χ
on the complement of ﬁnitely many points y1, . . . , yn, whose restriction to D×
yi
belongs to Opλi
LG(Dyi) ⊂OpLG(D×
yi) for some λi ∈P +. Then, in the same way
as in the unramiﬁed case, we construct localization functors from gκc,y -modIy
χy
to AutIy
E and from gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy to AutIy,m
E
(here, as before, χy = χ|D×
y ), and
this leads us to the conjectural equivalences (9.10).
The equivalences (9.10) also have family versions in which we allow E to
vary. It is analogous to the family version (8.15) of the local equivalences. As
in the local case, in a family version we can avoid using DG schemes.

126
E. Frenkel
The above construction may be generalized to allow local systems tamely
ramiﬁed at ﬁnitely many points y1, . . . , yn. The corresponding Hecke eigen-
sheaves are then D-modules on the moduli stack of G-bundles on X with
parabolic structures at y1, . . . , yn. Non-trivial examples of these Hecke eigen-
sheaves arise already in genus zero. These sheaves were constructed explicitly
in [F1] (see also [F4, F5]), and they are closely related to the Gaudin integrable
system.
9.5 Connections with Regular Singularities
So far we have only considered the categories of gκc-modules corresponding
to LG-opers on X which are regular everywhere except at a point y ∈X (or
perhaps, at several points) and whose restriction to D×
y is a nilpotent oper χy
in Opnilp
LG (Dy). In other words, χy is an oper with regular singularity at y with
residue ϖ(−ρ) (where ϖ : h∗→h∗/W). However, we can easily generalize
the localization functor to the categories of gκc-modules corresponding to LG-
opers which have regular singularity at y with arbitrary residue.
So suppose we are given an oper χ ∈OpRS
LG(D)ϖ(−λ−ρ) with regular sin-
gularity and residue ϖ(−λ −ρ), where λ ∈h∗. In this case the monodromy of
this oper around y is conjugate to
M = exp(2πi(λ + ρ)) = exp(2πiλ).
We then have the category gκc -modI0
χ of I0-equivariant gκc-modules with cen-
tral character χ. The case of λ = 0 is an “extremal” case when the category
gκc -modI0
χ is most complicated. On the other “extreme” is the case of generic
opers χ, corresponding to a generic λ. In this case one can show that the cat-
egory gκc -modI0
χ is quite simple: it contains irreducible objects Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χ)
labeled by the Weyl group of g, and each object of gκc -modI0
χ is a direct sum
of these irreducible modules. Here Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χ) is the quotient of the Verma
module
Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ = Ind
gκc
b+⊕C1 Cw(λ+ρ)−ρ,
w ∈W,
by the central character corresponding to χ.
For other values of λ the structure of gκc -modI0
χ is somewhere in-between
these two extreme cases.
Recall that we have a localization functor (9.5)
∆λ
κc,I0
y : gκc,y -modI0
y →Dκc,I0y -mod .
from gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy to a category of D-modules on Bun′
G,Iy twisted by the
pull-back of the line bundle K1/2 on BunG. We now restrict this functor
to the subcategory gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy where χy is a LG-oper on Dy with regular
singularity at y and residue ϖ(−λ −ρ).

Consider ﬁrst the case when λ ∈h∗is generic. Suppose that χy extends to a
regular oper χ on X\y. One then shows in the same way as in Theorem 5 that
for any object M of gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy the corresponding Dκc,I0
y-module ∆κc,I0
y(M)
is a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue Eχ, which is the LG-local system on X
with regular singularity at y underlying χ (if χy cannot be extended to X\y,
then ∆λ
κc,Iy(M) = 0, as before). Therefore we obtain a functor
∆κc,I0
y : gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy →Aut
I0
y
Eχ,
where Aut
I0
y
Eχ is the category of Hecke eigensheaves on Bun′
G,Iy with eigenvalue
Eχ.
Since we have assumed that the residue of the oper χy is generic, the
monodromy of Eχ around y belongs to a regular semi-simple conjugacy class of
LG containing exp(2πiλ). In this case the category gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy is particularly
simple, as we have discussed above. We expect that the functor ∆κc,I0y sets
up an equivalence between gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy and Aut
I0
y
Eχ.
We can formulate this more neatly as follows. For M ∈LG let BM be the
variety of Borel subgroups containing M. Observe that if M is regular semi-
simple, then BM is a set of points which is in bijection with W. Therefore
our conjecture is that Aut
I0
y
Eχ is equivalent to the category QCoh(BM) of
quasicoherent sheaves on BM, where M is a representative of the conjugacy
class of the monodromy of Eχ.
Consider now an arbitrary LG-local system E on X with regular singu-
larity at y ∈X whose monodromy around y is regular semi-simple. It is then
tempting to conjecture that, at least if E is generic, this category has the
same structure as in the case when E has the structure of an oper, i.e., it
is equivalent to the category QCoh(BM), where M is a representative of the
conjugacy class of the monodromy of E around y.
On the other hand, if the monodromy around y is unipotent, then BM is
nothing but the Springer ﬁber Spu, where M = exp(2πiu). The corresponding
category Aut
I0
y
E was discussed in Section 9.4 (we expect that it coincides with
AutIy,m
E
). Thus, we see that in both “extreme” cases: unipotent monodromy
and regular semi-simple monodromy, our conjectures identify the derived cat-
egory of Aut
I0
y
E with the derived category of the category QCoh(BM) (where
BM should be viewed as a DG scheme &
Sp
DG
u
in the unipotent case). One is
then led to conjecture, most ambitiously, that for any LG-local system E on X
with regular singularity at y ∈X the derived category of Aut
I0
y
E is equivalent
to the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves on a suitable DG version of
the scheme BM, where M is a representative of the conjugacy class of the
monodromy of E around y:
Db(Aut
I0
y
E ) ≃Db(QCoh(BDG
M )).

128
E. Frenkel
This has an obvious generalization to the case of multiple ramiﬁcation points,
where on the right hand side we take the Cartesian product of the varieties
BDG
Mi corresponding to the monodromies. Thus, we obtain a conjectural re-
alization of the categories of Hecke eigensheaves, whose eigenvalues are lo-
cal systems with regular singularities, in terms of categories of quasicoherent
sheaves.
It is useful to note that the Hecke eigensheaves on Bun′
G,Iy obtained above
via the localization functors may be viewed as pull-backs of twisted D-modules
on BunG,Iy (or, more generally, extensions of such pull-backs).
More precisely, for each λ ∈h∗we have the sheaf of twisted diﬀerential
operators on BunG,y acting on a “line bundle” Lλ. If λ were an integral weight,
this would be an actual line bundle, which is constructed as follows: note that
the map p : BunG,Iy →BunG, corresponding to forgetting the parabolic
structure, is a ﬁbration with the ﬁbers isomorphic to the ﬂag manifold G/B.
For each integral weight λ we have the G-equivariant line bundle ℓλ = G×
B Cλ
on G/B. The line bundle Lλ on BunG,Iy is deﬁned in such a way that its
restriction to each ﬁber of the projection p is isomorphic to ℓλ. We then set
Lλ = Lλ ⊗p∗(K1/2), where K1/2 is the square root of the canonical line
bundle on BunG corresponding to the critical level. Now, it is well-known
(see, e.g., [BB]) that even though the line bundle Lλ does not exist if λ is not
an integral weight, the corresponding sheaf Dλ
κc,Iy of Lλ-twisted diﬀerential
operators on BunG,Iy is still well-deﬁned.
Observe that we have an equivalence between the category Dλ
κc,Iy -mod
and the category of weakly H-equivariant Dκc,I0
y-module on Bun′
G,y on which
h acts via the character λ : h →C. If F is an object of Dλ
κc,Iy -mod, then
the corresponding weakly H-equivariant Dκc,I0
y-module on Bun′
G,y is π∗(F),
where π : Bun′
G,y →BunG,Iy.
Now, it is easy to see that the Dκc,I0
y-modules on Bun′
G,y obtained by
applying the localization functor ∆κc,I0
y to objects of gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy are always
weakly H-equivariant. Consider, for example, the case when χy is a generic
oper with regular singularity at y. Then its residue is equal to ϖ(−λ −ρ),
where λ is a regular element of h∗, and so its monodromy is M = exp(2πiλ).
The corresponding category gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy has objects Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy) that we
introduced above. The Cartan subalgebra h of gκc,y acts on Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy)
semi-simply with the eigenvalues given by the weights of the form w(λ + ρ) −
ρ + µ, where µ is an integral weight. In other words,
Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy) ⊗C−w(λ+ρ)+ρ
is Iy-equivariant. Therefore we ﬁnd that ∆κc,I0
y(Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy)) is weakly H-
equivariant, and the corresponding action of h is given by w(λ + ρ) −ρ :
h →C. Thus, ∆κc,I0
y(Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy)) is the pull-back of a Dw(λ+ρ)−ρ
κc,Iy
-module

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
129
on BunG,y. This Dw(λ+ρ)−ρ
κc,Iy
-module is a Hecke eigensheaf with eigenvalue Eχ
provided that χy = χ|D×
y , where χ is a regular oper on X\y.
Thus, for a given generic oper χy we have |W| diﬀerent Hecke eigensheaves
∆κc,I0y(Mw(λ+ρ)−ρ(χy)),
w ∈W,
on Bun′
G,y. However, each of them is the pull-back of a twisted D-module
on BunG,y corresponding to a particular twist: namely, by a “line bundle”
Lw(λ+ρ)−ρ. (Since we have assumed that λ is generic, all of these twists are
diﬀerent; note also that if µ = w(λ+ρ)−ρ, then exp(2πiµ) is in the conjugacy
class of the monodromy exp(2πiλ).) It is therefore natural to conjecture that
there is a unique Hecke eigensheaf on BunG,y with eigenvalue Eχ, which is a
twisted D-module with the twisting given by Lw(λ+ρ)−ρ.
More generally, suppose that E is a local system on X with regular sin-
gularity at y and generic regular semi-simple monodromy. Let us choose a
representative M of the monodromy which belongs to the Cartan subgroup
LH ⊂LG. Choose µ ∈h∗≃Lh to be such that M = exp(2πiµ). Note that
there are exactly |W| such choices up to a shift by an integral weight ν. Let
AutIy,µ
E
be the category of Hecke eigensheaves with eigenvalue E in the cate-
gory of twisted D-modules on BunG,Iy with the twisting given by Lµ. Then
we expect that for generic E the category AutIy,µ
E
has a unique irreducible
object. Its pull-back to Bun′
G,y is one of the |W| irreducible objects of Aut
I0
y
E .
(Note that tensoring with the line bundle Lν, where ν is an integral weight,
we identify the categories AutIy,µ
E
and AutIy,µ′
E
if µ′ = µ + ν.)
Similarly, one can describe the Hecke eigensheaves on Bun′
G,y obtained by
applying ∆κc,I0
y to the categories gκc,y -mod
I0
y
χy for other opers χy in terms of
twisted D-modules on BunG,y. In the opposite extreme case, when the residue
of χy is 0 (and so χy is a nilpotent oper), this is explained in Section 9.4. (In
this case one may choose to consider monodromic D-modules; this is not nec-
essary if λ is generic, because in this case there are no non-trivial extensions.)
Finally, it is natural to ask whether these equivalences for individual local
systems may be combined into a family version encompassing all of them.
The global geometric Langlands correspondence in the unramiﬁed case may be
viewed as a kind of non-abelian Fourier-Mukai transform relating the (derived)
category of D-modules on BunG and the (derived) category of quasicoherent
sheaves on LocLG(X), the stack of LG-local systems on the curve X. Under
this correspondence, the skyscraper sheaf supported at a LG-local system E
is supposed to go to the Hecke eigensheaf AutE on BunG. Thus, one may
think of LocLG(X) as a parameter space of a “spectral decomposition” of the
derived category of D-modules on BunG (see, e.g., [F6], Sect. 6.2, for more
details).
The above results and conjectures suggest that one may also view the
geometric Langlands correspondence in the tamely ramiﬁed case in a similar

130
E. Frenkel
way. Now the role of LocLG(X) should be played by the stack LocLG,y(X)
of parabolic LG-local systems with regular singularity at y ∈X (or, more
generally, multiple points) and unipotent monodromy. This stack classiﬁes
triples (F, ∇, FLB,y), where F is a LG-bundle on X, ∇is a connection on F
with regular singularity at y and unipotent monodromy, and FLB,y is a LB-
reduction of the ﬁber Fy of F at y, which is preserved by ∇. This stack is
now a candidate for a parameter space of a “spectral decomposition” of the
derived category of D-modules on the moduli stack BunG,y of G-bundles with
parabolic structure at y.19
9.6 Irregular Connections
We now generalize the above results to the case of connections with irregular
singularities. Let F be a LG-bundle on X with connection ∇that is regular
everywhere except for a point y ∈X, where it has a pole of order greater than
1. As before, we assume ﬁrst that (F, ∇) admits the structure of a LG-oper
on X\y, which we denote by χ. Let χy be the the restriction of χ to D×
y . A
typical example of such an oper is a LG-oper with pole of order ≤n on the
disc Dy, which is, by deﬁnition (see [BD1], Sect. 3.8.8), an LN[[t]]-conjugacy
class of operators of the form
(9.11)
∇= ∂t + 1
tn (p−1 + v(t)) ,
v(t) ∈Lb[[t]].
We denote the space of such opers by Op≤n
LG(Dy).
One can show that for χy ∈Op≤n
LG(Dy) the category gκc,y -modK
χy is non-
trivial if K is the congruence subgroup Km,y ⊂G(Oy) with m ≥n. (We recall
that for m > 0 we have Km,y = exp(g⊗(my)m), where my is the maximal ideal
of Oy.) Let us take the category gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
. Then our general formalism
gives us a localization functor
∆κc,Kn,y : gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
→Dκc,Kn,y -mod,
where Dκc,Kn,y -mod is the category of critically twisted20 D-modules on
BunG,y,n ≃Gout\G(Ky)/Kn,y.
This is the moduli stack of G-bundles on X with a level n structure at y∈X
(which is a trivialization of the restriction of the G-bundle to the nth inﬁni-
tesimal neighborhood of y).
19 One may also try to extend this “spectral decomposition” to the case of all con-
nections with regular singularities, but here the situation is more subtle, as can
already be seen in the abelian case.
20 this refers to the twisting by the line bundle on BunG,y,n obtained by pull-back
of the line bundle K1/2 on BunG, as before

Ramiﬁcations of the Geometric Langlands Program
131
In the same way as above, one shows that the D-modules obtained by
applying ∆κc,Kn,y to objects of gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
are Hecke eigensheaves with
the eigenvalue Eχ|X\y, where Eχ is the LG-local system underlying the oper
χ. Let AutKn,y
Eχ
be the category of these eigensheaves. Thus, we really obtain
a functor
gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
→AutKn,y
Eχ
.
By analogy with the case of regular connections, we expect that this functor
is an equivalence of categories.
As before, this functor may be generalized to an arbitrary ﬂat bundle
E = (F, ∇), where ∇has singularity at y, by representing it as an oper
with mild ramiﬁcation at additional points y1, . . . , ym on X. Let χy be the
restriction of this oper to D×
y . Then it belongs to Op≤n
LG(Dy) for some n, and
we obtain a functor
gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
→AutKn,y
E
,
which we expect to be an equivalence of categories for generic E. This also
has an obvious multi-point generalization.
This way we obtain a conjectural description of the categories of Hecke
eigensheaves corresponding to (generic) connections on X with arbitrary sin-
gularities at ﬁnitely many points in terms of categories of Harish-Chandra
modules of critical level over g. However, in the case of regular singularities,
we also have an alternative description of these categories: in terms of (de-
rived) categories of quasicoherent sheaves on the varieties BDG
M . It would be
desirable to obtain such a description for irregular connections as well.
Finally, we remark that the above construction has a kind of limiting
version where we take the inﬁnite level structure at y, i.e., a trivialization of
the restriction of a G-bundle to the disc Dy. Let BunG,y,∞be the moduli
stack of G-bundles on X with an inﬁnite level structure at y. Then
BunG,y,∞≃Gout\G(Ky).
We now have a localization functor
gκc,y -modχy →Aut∞
E ,
where E and χy are as above, and Aut∞
E is the category of Hecke eigen-
sheaves on BunG,y,∞with eigenvalue E|X\y. Thus, instead of the cate-
gory gκc,y -modKn,y
χy
of Harish-Chandra modules we now have the category
gκc,y -modχy of all (smooth) gκc,y-modules with ﬁxed central character (cor-
responding to χ).
According to our general local conjecture, this is precisely the local Lang-
lands category associated to the restriction of the local system E to D×
y
(equipped with an action of the loop group G(Ky)). It is natural to assume
that for generic E this functor establishes an equivalence between this category
and the category Aut∞
E of Hecke eigensheaves on BunG,y,∞(also equipped

132
E. Frenkel
with an action of the loop group G(Ky)). This may be thought of as the ul-
timate form of the local–to–global compatibility in the geometric Langlands
Program:

Let us summarize: by using representation theory of aﬃne Kac-Moody
algebras at the critical level we have constructed the local Langlands cate-
gories corresponding to the local Langlands parameters: LG-local systems on
the punctured disc. We then applied the technique of localization functors
to produce from these local categories, the global categories of Hecke eigen-
sheaves on the moduli stacks of G-bundles on a curve X with parabolic (or
level) structures. These global categories correspond to the global Langlands
parameters: LG-local systems on X with ramiﬁcation. We have used our re-
sults and conjectures on the structure of the local categories to investigate
these global categories. We hope that in this way representation theory of
aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras may one day fulﬁll the dream of uncovering the
mysteries of the geometric Langlands correspondence.

1 Introduction
This note is based on ﬁve lectures on the geometry of ﬂag manifolds and the
representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups, delivered at the CIME
summer school “Representation theory and Complex Analysis”, June 10–17,
2004, Venezia.
The study of the relation between the geometry of ﬂag manifolds and the
representation theory of complex algebraic groups has a long history. How-
ever, it was rather recently that we realized the close relation between the
representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups and the geometry of the
ﬂag manifold and its cotangent bundle. In these relations, there are two facets,
complex geometry and real geometry. The Matsuki correspondence is an ex-
ample: it is a correspondence between the orbits of the real semisimple group

on the ﬂag manifold and the orbits of the complexiﬁcation of its maximal
compact subgroup.
Among these relations, we focus on the diagram below.

The purpose of this note is to explain this diagram.
In the Introduction, we give an overview of this diagram, and we will
explain more details in the subsequent sections. In order to simplify the ar-
guments, in the Introduction we restrict ourselves to the case of the trivial
inﬁnitesimal character. In order to treat the general case, we need the “twist-
ing” of sheaves and of the ring of diﬀerential operators. For them, see the
subsequent sections.
Considerable parts of this note are joint work with W. Schmid, and were
announced in [21].
Acknowledgement. The author would like to thank Andrea D’Agnolo for the orga-
nization of the Summer School and his help during the preparation of this note.

advices.
1.1 Harish-Chandra Correspondence
Let GR be a connected real semisimple Lie group with a ﬁnite center, and KR
a maximal compact subgroup of GR. Let gR and kR be the Lie algebras of GR
and KR, respectively. Let g and k be their complexiﬁcations. Let K be the
complexiﬁcation of KR.
We consider a representation of GR. Here, it means a complete locally
convex topological space E with a continuous action of GR. A vector v in E

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
139
is called KR-ﬁnite if v is contained in a ﬁnite-dimensional KR-submodule of
E. Harish-Chandra considered
HC(E) := {v ∈E ; v is KR-ﬁnite} .
If E has ﬁnite KR-multiplicities, i.e., dim HomKR(V, E) < ∞for any ﬁnite-
dimensional irreducible representation V of KR, he called E an admissible
representation. The action of GR on an admissible representation E can be
diﬀerentiated on HC(E), and g acts on HC(E). Since any continuous KR-
action on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space extends to a K-action, HC(E) has
a (g, K)-module structure (see Deﬁnition 3.1.1).
Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A (g, K)-module M is called a Harish-Chandra module if
it satisﬁes the conditions:
(a) M is z(g)-ﬁnite,
(b) M has ﬁnite K-multiplicities,
(c) M is ﬁnitely generated over U(g).
Here, U(g) is the universal enveloping algebra of g and z(g) is the center of
U(g). The condition (a) means that the image of z(g) →End(M) is ﬁnite-
dimensional over C.
In fact, if two of the three conditions (a)–(c) are satisﬁed, then all of the
three are satisﬁed.
An admissible representation E is of ﬁnite length if and only if HC(E) is
a Harish-Chandra module.
The (g, K)-module HC(E) is a dense subspace of E, and hence E is the
completion of HC(E) with the induced topology on HC(E). However, for a
Harish-Chandra module M, there exist many representations E such that
HC(E) ≃M. Among them, there exist the smallest one mg(M) and the
largest one MG(M).
More precisely, we have the following results ([24, 25]). Let Tadm
GR
be the
category of admissible representations of GR of ﬁnite length. Let HC(g, K) be
the category of Harish-Chandra modules. Then, for any M ∈HC(g, K), there
exist mg(M) and MG(M) in Tadm
GR
satisfying:
HomHC(g,K)(M, HC(E)) ≃HomTadm
GR (mg(M), E),
HomHC(g,K)(HC(E), M) ≃HomTadm
GR (E, MG(M))
(1.1.1)
for any E ∈Tadm
GR . In other words, M →mg(M) (resp. M →MG(M)) is a
left adjoint functor (resp. right adjoint functor) of the functor HC: Tadm
GR
→
HC(g, K). Moreover we have
M ∼
−−→HC(mg(M)) ∼
−−→HC(MG(M))
for any M ∈HC(g, K).
For a Harish-Chandra module M and a representation E such that HC(E) ≃
M, we have

140
M. Kashiwara
M ⊂mg(M) ⊂E ⊂MG(M) .
We call mg(M) the minimal globalization of M and MG(M) the maximal
globalization of M. The space mg(M) is a dual Fr´echet nuclear space and
MG(M) is a Fr´echet nuclear space (see Example 2.1.2 (ii)).
Example 1.1.2. Let PR be a parabolic subgroup of GR and Y = GR/PR.
Then Y is compact. The space A (Y ) of real analytic functions, the space
C∞(Y ) of C∞-functions, the space L2(Y ) of L2-functions, the space Dist(Y )
of distributions, and the space B(Y ) of hyperfunctions are admissible rep-
resentations of GR, and they have the same Harish-Chandra module M. We
have
mg(M) = A (Y ) ⊂C∞(Y ) ⊂L2(Y ) ⊂Dist(Y ) ⊂B(Y ) = MG(M) .
The representation MG(M) can be explicitly constructed as follows. Let
us set
M ∗= HomC(M, C)K-ﬁni .
Here, the superscript “K-ﬁni” means the set of K-ﬁnite vectors. Then M ∗is
again a Harish-Chandra module, and we have
MG(M) ≃HomU(g)(M ∗, C∞(GR)) .
Here, C∞(GR) is a U(g)-module with respect to the right action of GR on
GR. The module HomU(g)(M ∗, C∞(GR)) is calculated with respect to this
structure. Since the left GR-action on GR commutes with the right action,
HomU(g)(M ∗, C∞(GR)) is a representation of GR by the left action of GR on
GR. We endow HomU(g)(M ∗, C∞(GR)) with the topology induced from the
Fr´echet nuclear topology of C∞(GR). The minimal globalization mg(M) is
the dual representation of MG(M ∗).
In § 10, we shall give a proof of the fact that M →mg(M) and M →
MG(M) are exact functors, and mg(M) ≃Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗U(g) M. Here,
Γc(GR; DistGR) is the space of distributions on GR with compact support.
1.2 Beilinson-Bernstein Correspondence
Beilinson and Bernstein established the correspondence between U(g)-modules
and D-modules on the ﬂag manifold.
Let G be a semisimple algebraic group with g as its Lie algebra. Let X be
the ﬂag manifold of G, i.e., the space of all Borel subgroups of G.
For a C-algebra homomorphism χ: z(g) →C and a g-module M, we say
that M has an inﬁnitesimal character χ if a · u = χ(a)u for any a ∈z(g) and
u ∈M. In Introduction, we restrict ourselves to the case of the trivial inﬁnites-
imal character, although we treat the general case in the body of this note. Let
χtriv : z(g) →C be the trivial inﬁnitesimal character (the inﬁnitesimal char-
acter of the trivial representation). We set Uχtriv(g) = U(g)/U(g) Ker(χtriv).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
141
Then Uχtriv(g)-modules are nothing but g-modules with the trivial inﬁnitesi-
mal character.
Let DX be the sheaf of diﬀerential operators on X. Then we have the
following theorem due to Beilinson-Bernstein [1].
Theorem 1.2.1.
(i) The Lie algebra homomorphism g →Γ(X; DX) in-
duces an isomorphism
Uχtriv(g) ∼
−−→Γ(X; DX) .
(ii) Hn(X; M ) = 0 for any quasi-coherent DX-module M and n ̸= 0.
(iii) The category Mod(DX) of quasi-coherent DX-modules and the category
Mod(Uχtriv(g)) of Uχtriv(g)-modules are equivalent by
Mod(DX) ∋M 
 Γ(X; M ) ∈Mod(Uχtriv(g)) ,
Mod(DX) ∋DX ⊗U(g) M
M ∈Mod(Uχtriv(g)) .


In particular, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1.2.2. The category HCχtriv(g, K) of Harish-Chandra modules
with the trivial inﬁnitesimal character and the category Mod K, coh(DX) of
coherent K-equivariant DX-modules are equivalent.
The K-equivariant DX-modules are, roughly speaking, DX-modules with an
action of K. (For the precise deﬁnition, see § 3.) We call this equivalence the
B-B correspondence.
The set of isomorphism classes of irreducible K-equivariant DX-modules is
isomorphic to the set of pairs (O, L) of a K-orbit O in X and an isomorphism
class L of an irreducible representation of the ﬁnite group Kx/(Kx)◦. Here Kx
is the isotropy subgroup of K at a point x of O, and (Kx)◦is its connected
component containing the identity. Hence the set of isomorphism classes of
irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with the trivial inﬁnitesimal character
corresponds to the set of such pairs (O, L).
1.3 Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence
The ﬂag manifold X has ﬁnitely many K-orbits. Therefore any coherent K-
equivariant DX-module is a regular holonomic DX-module (see [15]). Let
Db(DX) be the bounded derived category of DX-modules, and let Db
rh(DX)
be the full subcategory of Db(DX) consisting of bounded complexes of DX-
modules with regular holonomic cohomology groups.
Let Z −→Zan be the canonical functor from the category of complex
algebraic varieties to the one of complex analytic spaces. Then there exists
a morphism of ringed space π: Zan →Z. For an OZ-module F, let F an :=
OZan ⊗π−1OZ π−1F be the corresponding OZan-module. Similarly, for a DZ-
module M , let M an:=DZan⊗π−1DZπ−1M ≃OZan⊗π−1OZπ−1M be the corre-
sponding DZan-module. For a DZ-module M and a DZan-module N , we write

142
M. Kashiwara
HomDZ(M , N ) instead of Homπ−1DZ(π−1M , N ) ≃HomDZan(M an, N )
for short.
Let us denote by Db(CXan) the bounded derived category of sheaves
of C-vector spaces on Xan. Then the de Rham functor DRX : Db(DX) →
Db(CXan), given by DRX(M ) = RH om DX(OX, M an), induces an equiva-
lence of triangulated categories, called the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
([12])
DRX : Db
rh(DX) ∼
−−→Db
C-c(CXan) .
Here Db
C-c(CXan) is the full subcategory of Db(CXan) consisting of bounded
complexes of sheaves of C-vector spaces on Xan with constructible cohomolo-
gies (see [18] and also § 4.4).
Let RH(DX) be the category of regular holonomic DX-modules. Then it
may be regarded as a full subcategory of Db
rh(DX). Its image by DRX is a
full subcategory of Db
C-c(CXan) and denoted by Perv(CXan). Since RH(DX)
is an abelian category, Perv(CXan) is also an abelian category. An object of
Perv(CXan) is called a perverse sheaf on Xan.
Then the functor DRX induces an equivalence between Mod K, coh(DX)
and the category PervKan(CXan) of Kan-equivariant perverse sheaves on Xan:
DRX : Mod K, coh(DX) ∼
−−→PervKan(CXan) .
1.4 Matsuki Correspondence
The following theorem is due to Matsuki ([22]).
Proposition 1.4.1.
(i) There are only ﬁnitely many K-orbits in X and also
ﬁnitely many GR-orbits in Xan.
(ii) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of K-orbits and the
set of GR-orbits.
(iii) A K-orbit U and a GR-orbit V correspond by the correspondence in (ii)
if and only if U an ∩V is a KR-orbit.
Its sheaf-theoretical version is conjectured by Kashiwara [14] and proved by
Mirkovi´c-Uzawa-Vilonen [23].
In order to state the results, we have to use the equivariant derived cate-
gory (see [4], and also § 4). Let H be a real Lie group, and let Z be a topological
space with an action of H. We assume that Z is locally compact with a ﬁnite
cohomological dimension. Then we can deﬁne the equivariant derived category
Db
H(CZ), which has the following properties:
(a) there exists a forgetful functor Db
H(CZ) →Db(CZ),
(b) for any F ∈Db
H(CZ), its cohomology group Hn(F) is an H-equivariant
sheaf on Z for any n,

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
143
(c) for any H-equivariant morphism f : Z →Z′, there exist canonical functors
f −1, f ! : Db
H(CZ′) →Db
H(CZ) and f∗, f! : Db
H(CZ) →Db
H(CZ′) which
commute with the forgetful functors in (a), and satisfy the usual properties
(see § 4),
(d) if H acts freely on Z, then Db
H(CZ) ≃Db(CZ/H).
(e) if H is a closed subgroup of H′, then we have an equivalence
IndH′
H : Db
H(CZ) ∼
−−→Db
H′(C(Z×H′)/H) .
Now let us come back to the case of real semisimple groups. We have an
equivalence of categories:
IndGan
Kan : Db
Kan(CXan) ∼
−−→Db
Gan(C(Xan×Gan)/Kan).
(1.4.1)
Let us set S = G/K and SR = GR/KR. Then SR is a Riemannian symmetric
space and SR ⊂S. Let i: SR  →San be the closed embedding. Since (X ×
G)/K ≃X × S, we obtain an equivalence of categories
IndGan
Kan : Db
Kan(CXan) ∼
−−→Db
Gan(CXan×San) .
Let p1 : Xan × San →Xan be the ﬁrst projection and p2 : Xan × San →San
the second projection. We deﬁne the functor
Φ: Db
Kan(CXan) →Db
GR(CXan)
by
Φ(F) = Rp1!(IndGan
Kan(F) ⊗p−1
2 i∗CSR)[dS].
Here, we use the notation
dS = dim S.
(1.4.2)
Theorem 1.4.2 ([23]). Φ: Db
Kan(CXan) →Db
GR(CXan) is an equivalence of
triangulated categories.
Roughly speaking, there is a correspondence between Kan-equivariant
sheaves on Xan and GR-equivariant sheaves on Xan. We call it the (sheaf-
theoretical) Matsuki correspondence.
1.5 Construction of Representations of GR
Let H be an aﬃne algebraic group, and let Z be an algebraic manifold with an
action of H. We can in fact deﬁne two kinds of H-equivariance on DZ-modules:
a quasi-equivariance and an equivariance. (For their deﬁnitions, see Deﬁni-
tion 3.1.3.) Note that DZ ⊗OZ F is quasi-H-equivariant for any H-equivariant
OZ-module F, but it is not H-equivariant in general. The DZ-module OZ is

144
M. Kashiwara
H-equivariant. Let us denote by Mod(DZ, H) (resp. Mod H(DZ)) the category
of quasi-H-equivariant (resp. H-equivariant) DZ-modules. Then Mod H(DZ)
is a full abelian subcategory of Mod(DZ, H).
Let GR be a real semisimple Lie group contained in a semisimple algebraic
group G as a real form. Let FN be the category of Fr´echet nuclear spaces
(see Example 2.1.2 (ii)), and let FNGR be the category of Fr´echet nuclear
spaces with a continuous GR-action. It is an additive category but not an
abelian category. However it is a quasi-abelian category and we can deﬁne its
bounded derived category Db(FNGR) (see § 2).
Let Z be an algebraic manifold with a G-action. Let Db
coh(Mod(DZ, G)) be
the full subcategory of Db(Mod(DZ, G)) consisting of objects with coherent
cohomologies. Let Db
GR,R-c(CZan) be the full subcategory of the GR-equivariant
derived category Db
GR(CZan) consisting of objects with R-constructible coho-
mologies (see § 4.4). Then for M ∈Db
coh(Mod(DZ, G)) and F∈Db
GR,R-c(CZan),
we can deﬁne
RHomtop
DZ(M ⊗F, OZan)
as an object of Db(FNGR).
Roughly speaking, it is constructed as follows. (For a precise construction,
see § 5.) We can take a bounded complex DZ ⊗V
• of quasi-G-equivariant
DZ-modules which is isomorphic to M in the derived category, where each
Vn is a G-equivariant vector bundle on Z. On the other hand, we can rep-
resent F by a complex K
• of GR-equivariant sheaves such that each Kn
has a form ⊕a∈InLa for an index set In, where La is a GR-equivariant
locally constant sheaf of ﬁnite rank on a GR-invariant open subset Ua of
Zan.1
Let E (0, • )
Zan
be the Dolbeault resolution of OZan by diﬀerential forms
with C∞coeﬃcients. Then, HomDZ((DZ ⊗V
• ) ⊗K
• , E (0, • )
Zan
) represents
RHom DZ(M ⊗F, OZan) ∈Db(Mod(C)). On the other hand, HomDZ((DZ ⊗
Vn) ⊗La, E (0,q)
Zan ) = HomOZ(Vn ⊗La, E (0,q)
Zan ) carries a natural topology of
Fr´echet nuclear spaces and is endowed with a continuous GR-action. Hence
HomDZ((DZ ⊗V
• ) ⊗K
• , E (0, • )
Zan
) is a complex of objects in FNGR. It is
RHomtop
DZ(M ⊗F, OZan) ∈Db(FNGR).
Dually, we can consider the category DFNGR of dual Fr´echet nuclear spaces
with a continuous GR-action and its bounded derived category Db(DFNGR).
Then, we can construct R Γtop
c
(Zan; F ⊗ΩZan
L⊗DZM ), which is an object
of Db(DFNGR). Here, ΩZan is the sheaf of holomorphic diﬀerential forms
with the maximal degree. Let Dist(dZ, • ) be the Dolbeault resolution of
ΩZan by diﬀerential forms with distribution coeﬃcients. Then, the complex
Γc

Zan; K
• ⊗Dist(dZ, • ) ⊗DZ (DZ ⊗V
• )
	
represents R Γc(Zan; F ⊗ΩZan ⊗DZ
M ) ∈Db(Mod(C)). On the other hand, since Γc

Zan; K
• ⊗Dist(dz, • ) ⊗DZ
1 In fact, it is not possible to represent F by such a K
• in general. We overcome
this diﬃculty by a resolution of the base space Z (see § 5).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
145
(DZ ⊗V
• )
	
is a complex in DFNGR, it may be regarded as an object of
Db(DFNGR). It is R Γtop
c
(Zan; F ⊗ΩZan
L⊗DZM ). We have
R Γtop
c
(Zan; F ⊗ΩZan
L⊗DZM ) ≃

RHomtop
DZ(M ⊗F, OZan)
	∗.
Let us apply it to the ﬂag manifold X with the action of G. Let F be
an object of Db
GR, R-c(CXan). Then RHomtop
C (F, OXan) := RHomtop
DX(DX ⊗
F, OXan) is an object of Db(FNGR). This is strict, i.e., if we represent
RHomtop
C (F, OXan) as a complex in FNGR, the diﬀerentials of such a complex
have closed ranges. Moreover, its cohomology group Hn(RHomtop
C (F, OXan))
is the maximal globalization of some Harish-Chandra module (see § 10). Sim-
ilarly, RHomtop
C (F, ΩXan) := RHomtop
DX

(DX ⊗Ω⊗−1
X
) ⊗F, OXan	
is a strict
object of Db(FNGR) and its cohomology groups are the maximal globalization
of a Harish-Chandra module. Here ΩX is the sheaf of diﬀerential forms with
degree dX on X.
Dually, we can consider R Γtop
c
(Xan; F ⊗OXan) as an object of Db(DFNGR),
whose cohomology groups are the minimal globalization of a Harish-Chandra
module.
This is the left vertical arrow in Fig. 1.
Remark 1.5.1. Note the works by Hecht-Taylor [11] and Smithies-Taylor [27]
which are relevant to this note. They considered the DXan-module OXan ⊗F
instead of F, and construct the left vertical arrow in Fig. 1 in a similar way
to the Beilinson-Bernstein correspondence.
Let us denote by Mod f(g, K) the category of (g, K)-modules ﬁnitely
generated over U(g). Then, Mod f(g, K) has enough projectives. Indeed,
U(g) ⊗U(k) N is a projective object of Mod f(g, K) for any ﬁnite-dimensional
K-module N. Hence there exists a right derived functor
RHomtop
U(g)( • , C∞(GR)) : Db(Mod f(g, K))op →Db(FNGR)
of the functor HomU(g)( • , C∞(GR)): Mod f(g, K)op →FNGR. Similarly,

We assume that Y is projective. For N ∈Db(DY ) and K ∈Db(DY ×Z) we
deﬁne their convolution

where Dp2∗, Dp∗

D⊗are the direct image, inverse image, tensor product
functors for D-modules (see § 3). Similarly, for K ∈Db(CY an×Zan) and
F ∈Db(CZan), we deﬁne their convolution
K ◦F := R(pan

Let DRY ×Z : Db(DY ×Z) →Db(CY an×Zan) be the de Rham functor. Then we
have the following integral transform formula.

hol(DY ×Z), N ∈Db
coh(DY ) and F ∈Db(CZan),
set K = DRY ×Z(K ) ∈Db

then we have an isomorphism

GR, R-c(CSan), set K = DRX×S(K ) ∈Db

DS((N

≃RHomtop
DX(N ⊗(K ◦F), OXan)[dX −2dS]
(1.6.1)
in Db(FNGR).
Note that the non-characteristic condition in Theorem 1.6.1 is automatically
satisﬁed in this case.
1.7 Commutativity of Fig. 1
Let us apply Theorem 1.6.2 in order to show the commutativity of Fig. 1. Let
us start by taking M ∈Mod K, coh(DX). Then, by the Beilinson-Bernstein cor-
respondence, M corresponds to the Harish-Chandra module M := Γ(X; M ).
Let us set K = IndG
K(M ) ∈Mod G, coh(DX×S). If we set N = DX ⊗Ω⊗−1
X
∈
Mod(DX, G), then N
D◦K ∈Db
Mod(DS, G)
	
. By the equivalence of cate-
gories Mod(DS, G) ≃Mod(g, K), N
D◦K corresponds to M ∈Mod(g, K).
Now we take F = CSR[−dS]. Then the left-hand side of (1.6.1) coincides with
RHomtop
DS

N
D◦K , RH om (CSR[−dS], OSan)
	
≃RHomtop
DS(N
D◦K , BSR) ,
where BSR is the sheaf of hyperfunctions on SR. Since N
D◦K is an elliptic
DS-module, we have
RHomtop
DS(N
D◦K , BSR) ≃RHomtop
DS(N
D◦K , C ∞
SR ),
where C ∞
SR is the sheaf of C∞-functions on SR. The equivalence of categories
Mod(DS, G) ≃Mod(g, K) implies
RHomtop
DS(N
D◦K , C ∞
SR ) ≃RHomtop
U(g)(M, C∞(GR)) .
Hence we have calculated the left-hand side of (1.6.1):
RHomtop
DS((N
D◦K ) ⊗F, OSan) ≃RHomtop
U(g)(M, C∞(GR)) .
Now let us calculate the right-hand side of (1.6.1). Since we have
K := DRX×SK = DRX×S

IndG
K(M )
	
≃IndGan
Kan(DRX(M )),

148
M. Kashiwara
K ◦F is nothing but Φ(DRX(M ))[−2dS]. Therefore the right-hand side of
(1.6.1) is isomorphic to RHomtop
C (Φ(DRX(M )), ΩXan[dX]).
Finally we obtain
RHomtop
U(g)(Γ(X; M ) , C∞(GR))
≃RHomtop
C (Φ(DRX(M )), ΩXan[dX]),
(1.7.1)
or
MG(Γ(X; M )∗) ≃RHomtop
C (Φ(DRX(M )), ΩXan[dX]).
(1.7.2)
By duality, we have
mg(Γ(X; M )) ≃R Γtop
c
(Xan ; Φ(DRX(M )) ⊗OXan).
(1.7.3)
This is the commutativity of Fig. 1.
1.8 Example
Let us illustrate the results explained so far by taking SL(2, R) ≃SU(1, 1) as
an example. We set
GR = SU(1, 1) =
α β

X = P1.
Here G acts on the ﬂag manifold X = P1 = C ⊔{∞} by

Its inﬁnitesimal action LX : g →Γ(X; ΘX) (with the sheaf ΘX of vector ﬁelds
on X) is given by

We have
Γ(X; DX) = U(g)/U(g)∆,

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
149
where ∆= h(h −2) + 4ef = h(h + 2) + 4fe ∈z(g).
The ﬂag manifold X has three K-orbits:
{0}, {∞} and X \ {0, ∞} .
The corresponding three GR-orbits are
X−, X+ and XR,
where X± =
(
z ∈P1 ; |z| ≷1
)
and XR = {z ∈C ; |z| = 1}.
Let j0 : X\{0}  →X, j∞: X\{∞}  →X and j0,∞: X\{0, ∞}  →X be the
open embeddings. Then we have K-equivariant DX-modules OX, j0∗j−1
0 OX,
j∞∗j−1
∞OX and j0,∞∗j−1
0,∞OX. We have the inclusion relation:

There exist four irreducible K-equivariant DX-modules:
M0 = H1
{0}(OX) ≃j0∗j−1
0 OX/OX ≃j0,∞∗j−1
0,∞OX/j∞∗j−1
∞OX,
M∞= H1
{∞}(OX) ≃j∞∗j−1
∞OX/OX ≃j0,∞∗j−1
0,∞OX/j0∗j−1
0 OX,
M0,∞= OX,
M1/2 = OX
√z = DX/DX(LX(h) + 1).
Here, M0 and M∞correspond to the K-orbits {0} and {∞}, respectively,
while both M0,∞and M1/2 correspond to the open K-orbit X \ {0, ∞}.
Note that the isotropy subgroup Kz of K at z ∈X \ {0, ∞} is isomorphic
to {1, −1}, and M0,∞corresponds to the trivial representation of Kz and
M1/2 corresponds to the non-trivial one-dimensional representation of Kz.
By the Beilinson-Bernstein correspondence, we obtain four irreducible Harish-
Chandra modules with the trivial inﬁnitesimal character:
M0 = OX(X \ {0})/C = C[z−1]/C ≃U(g)/(U(g)(h −2) + U(g) f),
M∞= OX(X \ {∞})/C ≃C[z]/C ≃U(g)/(U(g)(h + 2) + U(g) e),
M0,∞= OX(X) = C ≃U(g)/(U(g) h + U(g) e + U(g) f),
M1/2 = C[z, z−1]√z ≃U(g)/(U(g)(h + 1) + U(g)∆).
Among them, M0,∞and M1/2 are self-dual, namely they satisfy M ∗≃M.
We have (M0)∗≃M∞.

150
M. Kashiwara
By the de Rham functor, the irreducible K-equivariant DX-modules are
transformed to irreducible Kan-equivariant perverse sheaves as follows:
DRX(M0) = C{0}[−1],
DRX(M∞) = C{∞}[−1],
DRX(M0,∞) = CXan,
DRX(M1/2) = CXan√z.
Here CXan√z is the locally constant sheaf on Xan \ {0, ∞} of rank one (ex-
tended by zero over Xan) with the monodromy −1 around 0 and ∞.
Their images by the Matsuki correspondence (see Proposition 9.4.3) are
Φ(DRX(M0)) ≃CX−[1],
Φ(DRX(M∞)) ≃CX+[1],
Φ(DRX(M0,∞)) ≃CXan,
Φ(DRX(M1/2)) ≃CXR
√z.
Note that CXR
√z is a local system on XR of rank one with the monodromy −1.
Hence (1.7.2) reads as
MG(M ∗
0 ) ≃MG(M∞) ≃RHomtop
C (CX−[1], ΩXan[1]) ≃ΩXan(X−),
MG(M ∗
∞) ≃MG(M0) ≃RHomtop
C (CX+[1], ΩXan[1]) ≃ΩXan(X+),
MG(M ∗
0,∞) ≃MG(M0,∞)≃RHomtop
C (CXan, ΩXan[1])
≃H1(Xan; ΩXan) ≃C,
MG(M ∗
1/2) ≃MG(M1/2)≃RHomtop
C (CXR
√z, ΩXan[1])
≃Γ

XR; BXR ⊗ΩXR ⊗CXR
√z
	
.
Here BXR is the sheaf of hyperfunctions on XR. Note that the exterior diﬀer-
entiation gives isomorphisms
OXan(X±)/C ∼
−−→
d
ΩXan(X±),
Γ(XR; BXR ⊗CXR
√z) ∼
−−→
d
Γ(XR; BXR ⊗ΩXR ⊗CXR
√z).
In fact, we have
mg(M0) ≃ΩXan(X+) ⊂ΩXan(X+) ≃MG(M0),
mg(M∞) ≃ΩXan(X−) ⊂ΩXan(X−) ≃MG(M∞),
mg(M0,∞) ∼

mg(M1/2) ≃Γ

≃MG(M1/2).

Here AXR is the sheaf of real analytic functions on XR.
For example, by (1.7.3), mg(M0) ≃R Γtop
c
(Xan; CX−[1]⊗OXan). The exact
sequence
0 →CX−→CXan →CX+ →0
yields the exact sequence:
H0(Xan; CX−⊗OXan) →H0(Xan; CXan ⊗OXan) →H0(Xan; CX+ ⊗OXan)
→H0(Xan; CX−[1] ⊗OXan) →H0(Xan; CXan[1] ⊗OXan),
in which H0(Xan; CX−⊗OXan) = {u ∈OXan(Xan) ; supp(u) ⊂X−} = 0,
H0(Xan; CXan ⊗OXan) = OXan(Xan) = C and H0(Xan; CXan[1] ⊗OXan) =
H1(Xan; OXan) = 0.
Hence we have
R Γtop
c
(Xan; CX−[1] ⊗OXan) ≃OXan(X+)/C.
The exterior diﬀerentiation gives an isomorphism
OXan(X+)/C ∼

1.9 Organization of the Note
So far, we have explained Fig. 1 brieﬂy. We shall explain more details in the
subsequent sections.
The category of representations of GR is not an abelian category, but it
is a so-called quasi-abelian category and we can consider its derived category.
In § 2, we explain the derived category of a quasi-abelian category following
J.-P. Schneiders [26].
In § 3, we introduce the notion of quasi-G-equivariant D-modules, and
study their derived category. We construct the pull-back and push-forward
functors for Db(Mod(DX, G)), and prove that they commute with the forget-
ful functor Db(Mod(DX, G)) →Db(Mod(DX)).
In § 4, we explain the equivariant derived category following Bernstein-
Lunts [4].
In § 5, we deﬁne RHomtop
DZ(M ⊗F, OZan) and study its functorial proper-
ties.
In § 6, we prove the ellipticity theorem, which says that, for a real form
i: XR  →X, RHomtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR) −→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗i∗i!CXR, OXan) is an

152
M. Kashiwara
isomorphism when M is an elliptic D-module. In order to construct this
morphism, we use the Whitney functor introduced by Kashiwara-Schapira
[20].
If we want to deal with non-trivial inﬁnitesimal characters, we need to
twist sheaves and D-modules. In § 7, we explain these twistings.
In § 8, we prove the integral transform formula explained in the subsec-
tion 1.6.
In § 9, we apply these results to the representation theory of real semisimple
Lie groups. We construct the arrows in Fig. 1.
As an application of § 9, we give a proof of the cohomology vanishing
theorem Hj(RHomtop
U(g)(M, C∞(GR))) = 0 (j ̸= 0) and its dual statement
Hj(Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗U(g)M) = 0 in § 10.
2 Derived Categories of Quasi-abelian Categories
2.1 Quasi-abelian Categories
The representations of real semisimple groups are realized on topological vec-
tor spaces, and they do not form an abelian category. However, they form a
so-called quasi-abelian category. In this section, we shall review the results of
J.-P. Schneiders on the theory of quasi-abelian categories and their derived
categories. For more details, we refer the reader to [26].
Let C be an additive category admitting the kernels and the cokernels. Let
us recall that, for a morphism f : X →Y in C, Im(f) is the kernel of Y →
Coker(f), and Coim(f) is the cokernel of Ker(f) →X. Then f decomposes as
X →Coim(f) →Im(f) →Y . We say that f is strict if Coim(f) →Im(f) is
an isomorphism. Note that a monomorphism (resp. epimorphism) f : X →Y
is strict if and only if X →Im(f) (resp. Coim(f) →Y ) is an isomorphism.
Note that, for any morphism f : X →Y , the morphisms Ker(f) →X and
Im(f) →Y are strict monomorphisms, and X →Coim(f) and Y →Coker(f)
are strict epimorphisms. Note also that a morphism f is strict if and only if
it factors as i ◦s with a strict epimorphism s and a strict monomorphism i.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1. A quasi-abelian category is an additive category admitting
the kernels and the cokernels which satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) the strict epimorphisms are stable by base changes,
(ii) the strict monomorphisms are stable by co-base changes.
The condition (i) means that, for any strict epimorphism u: X →Y and
a morphism Y ′ →Y , setting X′ = X ×Y Y ′ = Ker(X ⊕Y ′ →Y ), the
composition X′ →X ⊕Y ′ →Y ′ is a strict epimorphism. The condition (ii)
is the similar condition obtained by reversing arrows.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
153
Note that, for any morphism f : X →Y in a quasi-abelian category,
Coim(f) →Im(f) is a monomorphism and an epimorphism.
Remark that if C is a quasi-abelian category, then its opposite category
Cop is also quasi-abelian.
We recall that an abelian category is an additive category such that it
admits the kernels and the cokernels and all the morphisms are strict.
Example 2.1.2.
(i) Let Top be the category of Hausdorﬀlocally convex
topological vector spaces. Then Top is a quasi-abelian category. For a
morphism f : X →Y , Ker(f) is f −1(0) with the induced topology from
X, Coker(f) is Y/f(X) with the quotient topology of Y , Coim(f) is f(X)
with the quotient topology of X and Im(f) is f(X) with the induced
topology from Y . Hence f is strict if and only if f(X) is a closed subspace
of Y and the topology on f(X) induced from X coincides with the one
induced from Y .
(ii) Let E be a Hausdorﬀlocally convex topological vector space. Let us recall
that a subset B of E is bounded if for any neighborhood U of 0 there
exists c > 0 such that B ⊂c U. A family {fi} of linear functionals on E
is called equicontinuous if there exists a neighborhood U of 0 ∈E such
that fi(U) ⊂{c ∈C ; |c| < 1} for any i. For two complete locally convex
topological vector spaces E and F, a continuous linear map f : E →F is
called nuclear if there exist an equicontinuous sequence {hn}n⩾1 of linear
functionals on E, a bounded sequence {vn}n⩾1 of elements of F and a
sequence {cn} in C such that  |cn| < ∞and f(x) = 
n cnhn(x)vn for
all x ∈E.
A Fr´echet nuclear space (FN space, for short) is a Fr´echet space E such
that any homomorphism from E to a Banach space is nuclear. It is equiv-
alent to saying that E is isomorphic to the projective limit of a sequence
of Banach spaces F1 ←F2 ←· · · such that Fn →Fn−1 are nuclear for
all n. We denote by FN the full subcategory of Top consisting of Fr´echet
nuclear spaces.
A dual Fr´echet nuclear space (DFN space, for short) is the inductive limit
of a sequence of Banach spaces F1 →F2 →· · · such that Fn →Fn+1 are
injective and nuclear for all n. We denote by DFN the full subcategory
of Top consisting of dual Fr´echet nuclear spaces.
A closed linear subspace of an FN space (resp. a DFN space), as well as
the quotient of an FN space (resp. a DFN space) by a closed subspace,
is also an FN space (resp. a DFN space). Hence, both FN and DFN are
quasi-abelian.
A morphism f : E →F in FN or DFN is strict if and only if f(E) is a
closed subspace of F.
The category DFN is equivalent to the opposite category FNop of FN
by E →E∗, where E∗is the strong dual of E.
Note that if M is a C∞-manifold (countable at inﬁnity), then the space
C∞(M) of C∞-functions on M is an FN space. The space Γc(M; DistM)

154
M. Kashiwara
of distributions with compact support is a DFN space. If X is a complex
manifold (countable at inﬁnity), the space OX(X) of holomorphic func-
tions is an FN space. For a compact subset K of X, the space OX(K) of
holomorphic functions deﬁned on a neighborhood of K is a DFN space.
(iii) Let G be a Lie group. A Fr´echet nuclear G-module is an FN space E
with a continuous G-action, namely G acts on E and the action map
G×E →E is continuous. Let us denote by FNG the category of Fr´echet
nuclear G-modules. It is also a quasi-abelian category. Similarly we deﬁne
the notion of dual Fr´echet nuclear G-modules and the category DFNG.
The category (FNG)op and DFNG are equivalent.
2.2 Derived Categories
Let C be a quasi-abelian category. A complex X in C consists of objects
Xn (n ∈Z) and morphisms dn
X : Xn →Xn+1 such that dn+1
X
◦dn
X = 0. The
morphisms dn
X are called the diﬀerentials of X. Morphisms between complexes
are naturally deﬁned. Then the complexes in C form an additive category,
which will be denoted by C(C). For a complex X and k ∈Z, let X[k] be the
complex deﬁned by
X[k]n = Xn+k
dn
X[k] = (−1)kdn+k
X
.
Then X →X[k] is an equivalence of categories, called the translation functor.
We say that a complex X is a strict complex if all the diﬀerentials dn
X are
strict. We say that a complex X is strictly exact if Coker(dn−1
X
) →Ker(dn+1
X
)
is an isomorphism for all n. Note that dn
X : Xn →Xn+1 decomposes into
Xn ↠Coker(dn−1
X
) ↠Coim(dn
X) →Im(dn
X)↣Ker(dn+1
X
)↣Xn+1.
If X is strictly exact, then X is a strict complex and 0 →Ker(dn
X) →Xn →
Ker(dn+1
X
) →0 is strictly exact.
For a morphism f : X →Y in C(C), its mapping cone Mc(f) is deﬁned by
Mc(f)n = Xn+1 ⊕Y n and d n
Mc(f) =
3
−dn+1
X
0
f n+1 dn
Y
4
.
Then we have a sequence of canonical morphisms in C(C):
X
f
−−→Y
α(f)
−−−→Mc(f)
β(f)
−−−→X[1].
(2.2.1)
Let K(C) be the homotopy category, which is deﬁned as follows: Ob(K(C))=
Ob(C(C)) and, for X, Y ∈K(C), we deﬁne
HomK(C)(X, Y ) = HomC(C)(X, Y )/Ht(X, Y ),
where

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
155
Ht(X, Y ) = {f ∈HomC(C)(X, Y ) ; there exist hn : Xn →Y n−1 such that
f n = dn−1
Y
◦hn + hn+1 ◦dn
X for all n}.
A morphism in Ht(X, Y ) is sometimes called a morphism homotopic to zero.
A triangle in K(C) is a sequence of morphisms
X
f−→Y
g−→Z
h−→X[1]
such that g ◦f = 0, h ◦g = 0, f[1] ◦h = 0. For example, the image of (2.2.1)
in K(C) is a triangle for any morphism f ∈C(C). A triangle in K(C) is called
a distinguished triangle if it is isomorphic to the image of the triangle (2.2.1)
by the functor C(C) →K(C) for some morphism f ∈C(C). The additive cat-
egory K(C) with the translation functor
• [1] and the family of distinguished
triangles is a triangulated category (see e.g. [19]).
Note that if two complexes X and Y are isomorphic in K(C), and if X
is a strictly exact complex, then so is Y . Let E be the subcategory of K(C)
consisting of strictly exact complexes. Then E is a triangulated subcategory,
namely it is closed by the translation functors [k] (k ∈Z), and if X →Y →
Z →X[1] is a distinguished triangle and X, Y ∈E , then Z ∈E .
We deﬁne the derived category D(C) as the quotient category K(C)/E . It is
deﬁned as follows. A morphism f : X →Y is called a quasi-isomorphism (qis
for short) if, embedding it in a distinguished triangle X
f−→Y →Z →X[1],
Z belongs to E . For a chain of morphisms X
f−→Y
g−→Z in K(C), if two of f,
g and g ◦f are qis, then all the three are qis.
With this terminology, Ob(D(C)) = Ob(K(C)) and for X, Y ∈D(C),
HomD(C)(X, Y ) ≃

The composition of morphisms f : X →Y and g: Y →Z is visualized by the
following diagram:

if it is isomorphic to the image of a distinguished triangle in K(C). Then D(C)
is also a triangulated category.
Note that if X
f−→Y
g−→Z is a sequence of morphisms in C(C) such
that 0 →Xn →Y n →Zn →0 is strictly exact for all n, then the natural
morphism Mc(f) →Z is a qis, and we have a distinguished triangle
X →Y →Z →X[1]
in D(C).
We denote by C+(C) (resp. C−(C), Cb(C)) the full subcategory of C(C)
consisting of objects X such that Xn = 0 for n ≪0 (resp. n ≫0, |n| ≫0).
Let D∗(C) (∗= +, −, b) be the full subcategory of D(C) whose objects are
isomorphic to the image of objects of C∗(C). Similarly, we deﬁne the full
subcategory K∗(C) of K(C).
We call Db(C) the bounded derived category of C.
2.3 t-Structure
Let us deﬁne various truncation functors for X ∈C(C):
τ ⩽nX
: · · · −→Xn−1 −→
Ker dn
X
−→
0
−→
0
−→· · ·
τ ⩽n+1/2X : · · · −→Xn−1 −→

τ ⩾nX
: · · · −→

τ ⩾n+1/2X : · · · −→
0
−→
Coim dn
X
−→Xn+1 −→Xn+2 −→· · ·
for n ∈Z. Then we have morphisms
τ ⩽sX −→τ ⩽tX −→X −→τ ⩾sX −→τ ⩾tX
for s, t ∈
1
2Z such that s ⩽t. We can easily check that the functors
τ ⩽s, τ ⩾s : C(C) →C(C) send the morphisms homotopic to zero to morphisms
homotopic to zero and the quasi-isomorphisms to quasi-isomorphisms. Hence,
they induce the functors
τ ⩽s, τ ⩾s : D(C) →D(C)
and morphisms τ ⩽s →id →τ ⩾s. We have isomorphisms of functors:
τ ⩽s ◦τ ⩽t ≃τ ⩽min(s,t) , τ ⩾s ◦τ ⩾t ≃τ ⩾max(s,t) , and
τ ⩽s ◦τ ⩾t ≃τ ⩾t ◦τ ⩽s
for s, t ∈1
2Z.
We set τ >s = τ ⩾s+1/2 and τ <s = τ ⩽s−1/2.
We have a distinguished triangle in D(C):

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
157
τ ⩽sX −→X −→τ >sX −→(τ ⩽sX)[1].
For s ∈1
2Z, set
D⩽s(C) =
(
X ∈D(C) ; τ ⩽sX →X is an isomorphism
)
=
(
X ∈D(C) ; τ >sX ≃0
)
,
D⩾s(C) =
(
X ∈D(C) ; X →τ ⩾sX is an isomorphism
)
=
(
X ∈D(C) ; τ <sX ≃0
)
.
Then {D⩽s(C)}s∈1
2 Z is an increasing sequence of full subcategories of D(C),
and {D⩾s(C)}s∈1
2 Z is a decreasing sequence of full subcategories of D(C).
Note that D+(C) (resp. D−(C)) is the union of all the D⩾s(C)’s (resp. all
the D⩽s(C)’s), and Db(C) is the intersection of D+(C) and D−(C).
The functor τ ⩽s : D(C) →D⩽s(C) is a right adjoint functor of the inclusion
functor D⩽s(C)  →D(C), and τ ⩾s : D(C) →D⩾s(C) is a left adjoint functor of
D⩾s(C)  →D(C).
Set D>s(C) = D⩾s+1/2(C) and D<s(C) = D⩽s−1/2(C).
The pair (D⩽s(C), D>s−1(C)) is a t-structure of D(C) (see [3] and also
[18]) for any s ∈1
2Z. Hence, D⩽s(C) ∩D>s−1(C) is an abelian category. The
triangulated category D(C) is equivalent to the derived category of D⩽s(C) ∩
D>s−1(C). The full subcategory D⩽0(C) ∩D⩾0(C) is equivalent to C.
For X ∈C(C) and an integer n, the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) dn
X is strict,
(ii) τ ⩽nX →τ ⩽n+1/2X is a quasi-isomorphism,
(iii) τ ⩾n+1/2X →τ ⩾n+1X is a quasi-isomorphism.
Hence, for an object X of D(C), X is represented by some strict complex
if and only if all complexes in C(C) representing X are strict complexes. In
such a case, we say that X is strict. Then, its cohomology group Hn(X) :=
Coker(Xn−1 →Ker(dn
X)) ≃Ker(Coker(dn−1
X
) →Xn+1) has a sense as an
object of C. The following lemma is immediate.
Lemma 2.3.1. Let X →Y →Z
+1
−−→X[1] be a distinguished triangle, and
assume that X and Y are strict. If Hn(X) →Hn(Y ) is a strict morphism for
all n, then Z is strict. Moreover we have a strictly exact sequence:
· · · −→Hn(X) −→Hn(Y ) −→Hn(Z) −→Hn+1(X) −→Hn+1(Y ) −→· · · .
Remark 2.3.2. When C is either FN or DFN, a complex X in C is strictly
exact if and only if it is exact as a complex of vector spaces forgetting the
topology. A complex X is strict if and only if the image of the diﬀerential dn
X
is closed in Xn+1 for all n. Hence, denoting by F the functor from D(FN)
(resp. D(DFN)) to D(Mod(C)), a morphism f in D(FN) (resp. D(DFN)) is
an isomorphism if and only if so is F (u).

3 Quasi-equivariant D-Modules
3.1 Deﬁnition
For the theory of D-modules, we refer the reader to [16].
Let us recall the deﬁnition of quasi-equivariant D-modules (cf. [15]).
Let G be an aﬃne algebraic group over C and g its Lie algebra. A G-
module is by deﬁnition a vector space V endowed with an action of G such
that g →gv is a regular function on G for any v ∈V , i.e., there exist
ﬁnitely many vectors {vi}i in V and regular functions {ai(g)}i on G such
that gv = 
i ai(g)vi for any g ∈G. It is equivalent to saying that there is a
homomorphism V →OG(G) ⊗V (i.e., v →
i ai(g) ⊗vi) such that for any
g ∈G the action µg ∈EndC(V ) is given by V →OG(G)⊗V
i∗
g
−→V , where the
last arrow i∗
g is induced by the evaluation map OG(G) →C at g. Hence the
G-module structure is equivalent to the co-module structure over the cogebra
OG(G).
We denote by Mod(G) the category of G-modules, and by Mod f(G) the
category of ﬁnite-dimensional G-modules. It is well-known that any G-module
is a union of ﬁnite-dimensional sub-G-modules.
Let us recall the deﬁnition of (g, H)-modules for a subgroup H of G.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1. Let H be a closed subgroup of G with a Lie algebra h. A
(g, H)-module is a vector space M endowed with an H-module structure and
a g-module structure such that
(i) the h-module structure on M induced by the H-module structure coin-
cides with the one induced by the g-module structure,
(ii) the multiplication homomorphism g⊗M →M is H-linear, where H acts
on g by the adjoint action.
Let us denote by Mod(g, H) the category of (g, H)-modules.
Let X be a smooth algebraic variety with a G-action (we call it algebraic
G-manifold). Let µ: G×X→X denote the action morphism and pr: G×X→X
the projection. We shall deﬁne pk : G × G × X →G × X (k = 0, 1, 2) by
p0(g1, g2, x) = (g1, g2x),
p1(g1, g2, x) = (g1g2, x),
p2(g1, g2, x) = (g2, x).
µ(g, x) = gx,
pr(g, x) = x,
Then we have a simplicial diagram
G × G × X
p0

p1

p2
 G × X
µ

pr
 X.
It means that these morphisms satisfy the commutation relations:

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
159
µ ◦p0 = µ ◦p1,
pr ◦p1 = pr ◦p2,
µ ◦p2 = pr ◦p0.
Deﬁnition 3.1.2. A G-equivariant OX-module is an OX-module F endowed
with an isomorphism of OG×X-modules:
β : µ∗F ∼
−−→pr∗F
(3.1.1)
such that the following diagram commutes (associative law):

2β
 p∗
2pr∗F .
(3.1.2)
We denote by Mod(OX, G) the category of G-equivariant OX-modules which
are quasi-coherent as OX-modules.
For a G-equivariant OX-module F, we can deﬁne an action of the Lie
algebra g on F, i.e., a Lie algebra homomorphism:
Lv : g →EndC(F)
(3.1.3)
as follows. Let us denote by
LX : g →ΘX(X) →DX(X)
(3.1.4)
the inﬁnitesimal action of G on X. Here, ΘX denotes the sheaf of vector ﬁelds
on X, and DX denotes the sheaf of diﬀerential operators. It is a Lie algebra
homomorphism. Let us denote by
LG : g →Γ(G; DG)
(3.1.5)
the Lie algebra homomorphism derived by the left action of G on itself. Then
its image is the space of right invariant vector ﬁelds on G. Denoting by i: X →
G × X the map x →(e, x), we deﬁne
Lv(A)s = i∗
(LG(A) ⊠id)(βµ∗(s))

for A ∈g and s ∈F.
(3.1.6)
It is a derivation, namely
Lv(A)(as) =

LX(A)a
	
s + a

Lv(A)s
	
for A ∈g, a ∈OX and s ∈F.
The notion of equivariance of D-modules is deﬁned similarly to the one of
equivariant O-modules. However, there are two options in the D-module case.
Let OG ⊠DX denote the subring OG×X ⊗pr−1OX pr−1DX of DG×X. There are
two ring morphisms
pr−1DX →OG ⊠DX
and
OG×X →OG ⊠DX.

Deﬁnition 3.1.3. A quasi-G-equivariant DX-module is a DX-module M en-
dowed with an OG ⊠DX-linear isomorphism
β : Dµ∗M ∼
−−→Dpr∗M
(3.1.7)
such that the following diagram commutes (associative law):

Here Dµ∗, Dp∗
0, etc. are the pull-back functors for D-modules (see § 3.4). If
moreover β is DG×X-linear, M is called G-equivariant.
For quasi-G-equivariant DX-modules M and N , a G-equivariant morphism
u: M →N is a DX-linear homomorphism u: M →N such that
Dµ∗M

 Dpr∗M

commutes. Let us denote by Mod(DX, G) the category of quasi-coherent
quasi-G-equivariant DX-modules, and by Mod G(DX) the full subcategory of
Mod(DX, G) consisting of quasi-coherent G-equivariant DX-modules. Then
they are abelian categories, and the functor Mod G(DX) →Mod(DX, G)
is fully faithful and exact, and the functors Mod(DX, G) →Mod(DX) →
Mod(OX) and Mod(DX, G) →Mod(OX, G) are exact.
Roughly speaking, quasi-equivariance means the following. For g ∈G let
µg : X →X denotes the multiplication map. Then a DX-linear isomorphism
βg : µ∗
gM ∼
−−→M is given in such a way that it depends algebraically on g and
satisﬁes the chain condition βg1g2 = βg2 ◦βg1 for g1, g2 ∈G: the diagram

Example 3.1.
(i) If F is a G-equivariant OX-module, then DX ⊗OX F is a
quasi-G-equivariant DX-module.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
161
(ii) Let P1, . . . , Pℓbe a family of G-invariant diﬀerential operators on X.
Then DX/
 
i DXPi
	
is a quasi-G-equivariant DX-module.
Let M be a quasi-G-equivariant DX-module. Then the G-equivariant OX-
module structure on M induces the Lie algebra homomorphism
Lv : g →EndC(M ).
On the other hand, the DX-module structure on M induces the Lie algebra
homomorphism
αD : g →Γ(X; DX) →EndC(M ).
Hence we have:
αD(A)s = i∗
(LG(A) ⊠1)(µ∗(s))
	
Lv(A)s = i∗
(LG(A) ⊠1)(β ◦µ∗(s))
	
for s ∈M and A ∈g.
Set
γM = Lv −αD : g →EndC(M ).
Since we have
[Lv(A), P] = [αD(A), P] for any A ∈g and P ∈DX,
the homomorphism γM sends g to EndDX(M ). The homomorphism γM : g →
EndDX(M ) vanishes if and only if LG(A) ⊠1 ∈ΘG×X commutes with β for
all A ∈g. Thus we have obtained the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1.4. Let M be a quasi-G-equivariant DX-module. Let γM be as
above. Then we have
(i) γM is a Lie algebra homomorphism g →EndDX(M ),
(ii) M is G-equivariant if and only if γM = 0.
Thus M has a (DX, U(g))-bimodule structure.
When G acts transitively on X, we have the following description of quasi-
equivariant D-modules.
Proposition 3.1.5 ([15]). Let X = G/H for a closed subgroup H of G, and
let i: pt →X be the map associated with e mod H. Then M →i∗M gives
equivalences of categories
Mod(DX, G) ∼
−−→
Mod(g, H)


Mod G(DX)
∼
−−→Mod(H/H◦),
where H◦is the connected component of H containing the identity.
The g-module structure on i∗M is given by γM. We remark that Mod(H/H◦)
is embedded in Mod(g, H) in such a way that g acts trivially on the vector
spaces in Mod(H/H◦).

162
M. Kashiwara
Remark 3.1.6. The inclusion functor Mod G(DX) →Mod(DX, G) has a left
adjoint functor and a right adjoint functor
M −→C ⊗U(g) M
and
M −→HomU(g)(C, M ).
Here U(g) acts on M via γM.
3.2 Derived Categories
Recall that Mod(DX, G) denotes the abelian category of quasi-coherent quasi-
G-equivariant DX-modules. There are the forgetful functor
Mod(DX, G) →Mod(OX, G)
and
DX ⊗OX
• : Mod(OX, G) →Mod(DX, G).
They are adjoint functors to each other. Namely there is a functorial isomor-
phism in F ∈Mod(OX, G) and M ∈Mod(DX, G)
HomMod(OX,G)(F, M ) ∼= HomMod(DX,G)(DX ⊗OX F, M ).
(3.2.1)
Note that, for F ∈Mod(OX, G), the morphism γM : g →EndDX(M ) for
M = DX ⊗OX F is given by γM(A)(P ⊗s) = −PLX(A)⊗s+P ⊗Lv(A)s for
A ∈g, P ∈DX, s ∈F. Hence DX ⊗OX F is not a G-equivariant DX-module
in general.
Let Mod coh(DX, G) denote the full subcategory of Mod(DX, G) consist-
ing of coherent quasi-G-equivariant DX-modules. Similarly let us denote by
Mod coh(OX, G) the category of coherent G-equivariant OX-modules.
We shall introduce the following intermediate category.
Deﬁnition 3.2.1. A quasi-coherent OX-module (resp. DX-module) is called
countably coherent if it is locally generated by countably many sections.
Note that if F is a countably coherent OX-module, then there exists locally
an exact sequence O⊕I
X →O⊕J
X
→F →0 where I and J are countable sets.
Note also that any coherent DX-module is countably coherent over OX.
Hence a quasi-coherent DX-module is countably coherent, if and only if so is
it as an OX-module.
Note that countably coherent O-modules are stable by inverse images,
direct images and tensor products.
Let Mod cc(DX, G) denote the full subcategory of Mod(DX, G) consisting
of countably coherent quasi-G-equivariant DX-modules.
Let us denote by D(DX, G) the derived category of Mod(DX, G). Let
Dcc(DX, G) (resp. Dcoh(DX, G)) denotes the full subcategory of D(DX, G)
consisting of objects whose cohomologies belong to Mod cc(DX, G) (resp.
Mod coh(DX, G)).
Let us denote by Db(DX, G) the full subcategory of D(DX, G) consisting
of objects with bounded cohomologies. We deﬁne similarly Db
cc(DX, G) and
Db
coh(DX, G).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
163
Proposition 3.2.2. The functors
Db(Mod cc(DX, G)) →Db
cc(DX, G)
and
Db(Mod coh(DX, G)) →Db
coh(DX, G)
are equivalences of categories.
This follows easily from the following lemma and a standard argument
(e.g. cf. [19])
Lemma 3.2.3. Any quasi-coherent G-equivariant OX-module is a union of
coherent G-equivariant OX-submodules. Similarly, any quasi-coherent quasi-
G-equivariant DX-module is a union of coherent quasi-G-equivariant DX-
submodules.
3.3 Sumihiro’s Result
Hereafter we shall assume that X is quasi-projective, i.e., X is isomorphic to a
subscheme of the projective space Pn for some n. In such a case, Mod(DX, G)
has enough objects so that Db(DX, G) is a desired derived category, namely,
the forgetful functor Db(DX, G) →Db(DX) commutes with various functors
such as pull-back functors, push-forward functors, etc. This follows from the
following result due to Sumihiro [28].
Proposition 3.3.1. Let X be a quasi-projective G-manifold.
(i) There exists a G-equivariant ample invertible OX-module.
(ii) There exists a G-equivariant open embedding from X into a projective
G-manifold.
In the sequel, we assume
X is a quasi-projective G-manifold.
(3.3.1)
Let L be a G-equivariant ample invertible OX-module.
Lemma 3.3.2. Let F be a coherent G-equivariant OX-module. Then, for n ≫
0, there exist a ﬁnite-dimensional G-module V and a G-equivariant surjective
homomorphism
L ⊗−n ⊗V ↠F.
(3.3.2)
Proof.
For n ≫0, F ⊗L ⊗n is generated by global sections. Take a
ﬁnite-dimensional G-submodule V of the G-module Γ(X; F ⊗L ⊗n) such that
V ⊗OX →F ⊗L ⊗n is surjective. Then this gives a desired homomorphism.
Q.E.D.
Lemma 3.3.2 implies the following exactitude criterion.

164
M. Kashiwara
Lemma 3.3.3. Let M ′ →M →M ′′ be a sequence in Mod(OX, G). If
HomMod(OX,G)(E , M ′) →HomMod(OX,G)(E , M ) →HomMod(OX,G)(E , M ′′)
is exact for any locally free G-equivariant OX-module E of ﬁnite rank, then
M ′ →M →M ′′ is exact.
Let us denote by Mod lf (DX, G) the full subcategory of Mod coh(DX, G)
consisting of objects of the form DX ⊗OX E for a locally free coherent G-
equivariant OX-module E . By Lemma 3.3.2, for any M ∈Mod coh(DX, G),
there exists a surjective G-equivariant homomorphism N →M with N ∈
Mod lf (DX, G).
Lemma 3.3.2 together with standard arguments (see e.g. [19]), we obtain
Proposition 3.3.4. For any M ∈K−
Mod coh(DX, G)
	
there exist N
∈
K−
Mod lf (DX, G)
	
and a quasi-isomorphism N →M .
The abelian category Mod(DX, G) is a Grothendieck category. By a gen-
eral theory of homological algebra, we have the following proposition (see e.g.
[19]).
Proposition 3.3.5. Any object of Mod(DX, G) is embedded in an injective
object of Mod(DX, G).
Injective objects of Mod(DX, G) have the following properties.
Lemma 3.3.6. The forgetful functor Mod(DX, G) →Mod(OX, G) sends the
injective objects to injective objects.
This follows from (3.2.1) and the exactitude of F →DX ⊗OX F.
Lemma 3.3.7. Let I be an injective object of Mod(OX, G). Then the func-
tor F →HomOX(F, I ) is an exact functor from Mod coh(OX, G)op to
Mod(OX, G).
Proof. By Lemma 3.3.3, it is enough to remark that, for any locally free
E ∈Mod coh(OX, G),
HomMod(OX,G)

E , HomOX(F, I )
	 ∼= HomMod(OX,G)(E ⊗OX F, I )
is an exact functor in F.
Q.E.D.
Proposition 3.3.8. Let I be an injective object of Mod(OX, G). Then for
any F ∈Mod coh(OX, G),
E xtk
OX(F, I ) = 0
and
Extk
OX(F, I ) = 0
for k > 0.
(3.3.3)

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation

Proof. Let us prove ﬁrst the global case.
(1) Projective case.
Assume ﬁrst that X is projective. We have
Extk
OX(F, I ) = lim
−→
E
Extk
OX(F, E )
where E ranges over the set of coherent G-equivariant OX-submodules of I .
Hence it is enough to show that for such an E
β : Extk
OX(F, E ) →Extk
OX(F, I )
vanishes. We shall prove this by the induction on k > 0.
For n ≫0, there exists a G-equivariant surjective morphism V ⊗L ⊗−n →
F →0 by Lemma 3.3.2, which induces an exact sequence 0 →F ′ →V ⊗
L ⊗−n →F →0. We may assume that n is so large that Hm(X; E ⊗L ⊗n) =
0 for any m > 0. Then Extm
OX(V ⊗L ⊗−n, E ) = V ∗⊗Hm(X; E ⊗L ⊗n) = 0
for m > 0, and hence we obtain a commutative diagram with exact rows:
Extk−1

 Extk−1

OX(F, I ).
The homomorphism γ is surjective, because I is injective for k = 1 and the
induction hypothesis implies Extk−1
OX (F ′, I ) = 0 for k > 1. Hence we have
δ = 0, and the surjectivity of α implies β = 0.
(2) General case.
Let us embed X in a projective G-manifold ¯X and let
j : X  →¯X be the open embedding. Since
HomO ¯
X(N , j∗I ) = HomOX(j−1N , I )
for N ∈Mod(O ¯
X, G), j∗I is an injective object of Mod(O ¯
X, G). Let J be
the deﬁning ideal of ¯X \ X. Then J is a coherent G-equivariant ideal of O ¯
X.
Let us take a coherent G-equivariant O ¯
X-module F such that F|X ≃F.
Then, the isomorphism (see [6])
Extk
OX(F, I ) = lim
−→
n
Extk
O ¯
X(F ⊗OX Jn, j∗I )
implies the desired result.
The local case can be proved similarly to the proof in (1) by using
Lemma 3.3.7.
Q.E.D.
Proposition 3.3.9. Let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-
projective G-manifolds. Then for any injective object I of Mod(OX, G) and
F ∈Mod coh(OX, G), we have
Rkf∗

HomOX(F, I )
	
= 0
for k > 0.

166
M. Kashiwara
Proof.
The proof is similar to the proof of the preceding proposition.
The morphism f : X →Y can be embedded in ¯f : ¯X →¯Y for projective
G-manifolds ¯X and ¯Y . Let j : X →¯X be the open embedding. Let J be
the deﬁning ideal of ¯X \ X. Then, extending F to a coherent G-equivariant
O ¯
X-module F, one has
Rkf∗

HomOX(F, I )
	
≃lim
−→
n
Rk ¯f∗

HomOX( ¯

Hence, we may assume from the beginning that X and Y are projective.
Then we can argue similarly to (1) in the proof of Proposition 3.3.8, once we
prove
F →f∗HomOX(F, I ) is an exact functor in F ∈Mod coh(OX, G).
(3.3.4)
This follows from Lemma 3.3.3 and the exactitude of the functor
HomMod(OY ,G)(E , f∗HomOX(F, I )) ≃HomMod(OX,G)(f ∗E ⊗OX F, I )
in F for any locally free G-equivariant coherent OY -module E .
Q.E.D.
By this proposition, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 3.3.10. Let I be an injective object of Mod(DX, G). Then for
any morphism f : X →Y of quasi-projective G-manifolds and a coherent
locally free G-equivariant OX-module E
Rkf∗(E ⊗OX I ) = 0
for k > 0.
(3.3.5)
Lemma 3.3.11. For any morphism f : X →Y and M ∈Mod cc(DX, G) and
a coherent locally free G-equivariant OX-module E , there exists a monomor-
phism M →M ′ in Mod cc(DX, G) such that Rkf∗(E ⊗OX M ′) = 0 for any
k ̸= 0.
Proof.
Let us take a monomorphism M →I where I is an injective
object of Mod(DX, G). Let us construct, by the induction on n, an increasing
sequence {Mn}n⩾0 of countably coherent subobjects of I such that M0 = M
and
Rkf∗(E ⊗Mn) →Rkf∗(E ⊗Mn+1) vanishes for k ̸= 0.
(3.3.6)
Assuming that Mn has been constructed, we shall construct Mn+1. We
have
lim
−→
N ⊂I
Rkf∗(E ⊗N ) ∼= Rkf∗(E ⊗I ) = 0
for k ̸= 0.
Here N ranges over the set of countably coherent subobjects of I . Since
Rkf∗(E ⊗Mn) is countably coherent, there exists a countably coherent sub-
object Mn+1 of I such that Mn ⊂Mn+1 and the morphism Rkf∗(E ⊗Mn) →
Rkf∗(E ⊗Mn+1) vanishes for k ̸= 0.

Q.E.D.
3.4 Pull-back Functors
Let f : X →Y be a morphism of quasi-projective algebraic manifolds. Set
DX→Y = OX ⊗f −1OY f −1DY . Then DX→Y has a structure of a (DX, f −1DY )-
bimodule. It is countably coherent as a DX-module. Then
f ∗: N →DX→Y ⊗DY N = OX ⊗OY N
gives a right exact functor from Mod(DY ) to Mod(DX). It is left derivable,
and we denote by Df ∗its left derived functor:
Df ∗: Db(DY ) →Db(DX).
Now let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-projective alge-
braic G-manifolds. Then f ∗: N →DX→Y ⊗DY N = OX ⊗OY N gives also
a right exact functor:
f ∗: Mod(DY , G) →Mod(DX, G).
Lemma 3.3.2 implies that any quasi-coherent quasi-G-equivariant DY -
module has a ﬁnite resolution by quasi-coherent quasi-G-equivariant DY -
modules ﬂat over OY . Hence the functor f ∗: Mod(DY , G) →Mod(DX, G)
is left derivable. We denote its left derived functor by Df ∗:
Df ∗: Db(DY , G) →Db(DX, G).
(3.4.1)
By the construction, the diagram

morphism, then Df ∗sends Db
coh(DY , G) to Db
coh(DX, G).

3.5 Push-forward Functors
Let f : X →Y be a morphism of quasi-projective algebraic manifolds. Recall
that the push-forward functor
Df∗: Db(DX) →Db(DY )
(3.5.1)
is deﬁned by Rf∗(DY ←X
L⊗DXM ). Here DY ←X is an (f −1DY , DX)-bimodule
f −1DY ⊗f −1OY ΩX/Y , where we use the notations:
ΩX := ΩdX
X
and ΩX/Y := ΩX ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
.
Let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-projective algebraic
G-manifolds. Let us deﬁne the push-forward functor
Df∗: Db(DX, G) →Db(DY , G)
(3.5.2)
in the equivariant setting.
In order to calculate DY ←X
L⊗DXM , let us take a resolution of DY ←X by
ﬂat DX-modules:
0 ←DY ←X ←f −1(DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
) ⊗ΩdX
X ⊗DX
←f −1(DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
) ⊗ΩdX−1

←f −1(DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
) ⊗Ω0
X ⊗DX ←0.
(3.5.3)
It is an exact sequence of (f −1DY , DX)-bimodules. Thus, for a complex M of
DX-modules, DY ←X
L⊗DXM is represented by the complex of f −1DY -modules
f −1(DY ⊗OY Ω⊗−1
Y
) ⊗f −1OY Ω
•
X ⊗OX M [dX] .
(3.5.4)
The diﬀerential of the complex (3.5.4) is given as follows. First note that
there is a left DY -linear homomorphism
d: DY ⊗OY Ω⊗−1
Y
→DY ⊗OY Ω⊗−1
Y

given by
d(P ⊗dy⊗−1) = −

Here (y1, . . . , ym) is a local coordinate system of Y , dy⊗−1 = (dy1 ∧· · · ∧

ϕ: f −1(DY ⊗Ω⊗−1

Then, taking a local coordinate system (x1, . . . , xn) of X, the diﬀerential d of

We now deﬁne the functor

by
K f∗(M ) := f∗

For an injective object M of Mod(DX, G), Corollary 3.3.10 implies
Rkf∗(Ωp
X ⊗OX M ) = 0
for any p and any k > 0.
(3.5.5)
Hence if I
• is an exact complex in Mod(DX, G) such that all I n are injec-
tive, then K f∗(I
• ) is exact. Hence K f∗is right derivable. Let Df∗be its
right derived functor:
Df∗: D+(Mod(DX, G)) →D+(Mod(DY , G)).
For a complex M in Mod(DX, G) bounded from below, we have
K f∗M ∼
−−→Df∗(M )
as soon as Rkf∗(Ωp
X ⊗OX M n) = 0 for all k ̸= 0 and p, n.
(3.5.6)
By the construction, the following diagram commutes.
D+(Mod(DX, G))
Df∗

D+(Mod(DY , G))

Df∗

Since Df∗sends Db(Mod(DX)) to Db(Mod(DY )), we conclude that Df∗
sends Db(DX, G) to Db(DY , G), and Db
cc(DX, G) to Db
cc(DY , G).
Proposition 3.5.1. The restriction

170
M. Kashiwara
Kcc f∗: Kb(Mod cc(DX, G)) →Kb(Mod cc(DY , G))
of K f∗is right derivable and the diagram

 Db

quasi-commutes.
Proof. It is enough to show that, for any M ∈Kb(Mod cc(DX, G)), we can
ﬁnd a quasi-isomorphism M →M ′ such that the morphism Kf∗(M ′) →
Df∗(M ) is an isomorphism in Db(DY , G). In order to have such an isomor-
phism, it is enough to show that M ′ satisﬁes the condition in (3.5.6). By
Lemma 3.3.11, we have a quasi-isomorphism M →M ′ such that M ′ is a com-
plex in Mod cc(DX, G) bounded below and satisﬁes the condition in (3.5.6).
Since the cohomological dimension of Rf∗is ﬁnite, by taking n suﬃciently
large, the truncated complex τ ⩽nM ′ satisﬁes the condition in (3.5.6), and
M →τ ⩽nM ′ is a quasi-isomorphism.
Q.E.D.
Note that, if f is projective, Df∗sends Db
coh(DX, G) to Db
coh(DY , G) (see
[16]).
3.6 External and Internal Tensor Products
Let X and Y be two algebraic G-manifolds. Let q1 : X × Y
→X and
q2 : X × Y
→Y be the projections. Then for M1 ∈Mod(DX, G) and
M2 ∈Mod(DY , G), M1 ⊠M2 = (OX×Y ⊗q−1
1
OX q−1
1 M1) ⊗q−1
2
OY q−1
2 M2
has a structure of quasi-G-equivariant DX×Y -module. Since this is an exact
bi-functor, we obtain
• ⊠•
: Db(DX, G) × Db(DY , G) →Db(DX×Y , G).
Taking pt as Y , we obtain
• ⊗•
: Db(DX, G) × Db(Mod(G)) →Db(DX, G).
Here Mod(G) denotes the category of G-modules.
For two quasi-G-equivariant DX-modules M1 and M2, the OX-module
M1 ⊗OX M2 has a structure of DX-module by
v(s1 ⊗s2) = (vs1) ⊗s2 + s1 ⊗(vs2)
for v ∈ΘX and sν ∈Mν.
Since this is G-equivariant, we obtain the right exact bi-functor
• ⊗•
: Mod(DX, G) × Mod(DX, G) →Mod(DX, G).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
171
Taking its left derived functor, we obtain
•
D⊗•
: Db(DX, G) × Db(DX, G) −→Db(DX, G).
We have
M1
D⊗M2 ≃M1 ⊗OX M2
if either M1 or M2 are complexes in Mod(DX, G) ﬂat over OX.
The functor
•
D⊗• sends Db
cc(DX, G) × Db
cc(DX, G) to Db
cc(DX, G).
Note that, denoting by δ: X →X × X the diagonal embedding, we have
M1
D⊗M2 ≃Dδ∗(M1 ⊠M2).
Lemma 3.6.1. For F ∈Mod(OX, G) and M ∈Mod(DX, G), there exists a
canonical isomorphism in Mod(DX, G) :
(DX ⊗OX F) ⊗M ≃DX ⊗OX (F ⊗OX M ).
(3.6.1)
Here F ⊗OX M in the right-hand side is regarded as a G-equivariant OX-
module.
The proof is similar to the one in [16] in the non-equivariant case.
3.7 Semi-outer Hom
Let M ∈Mod coh(DX, G) and M ′ ∈Mod(DX, G). Then the vector space
HomDX(M , M ′) has a structure of G-modules as follows:
HomDX(M , M ′) →HomDG×X(µ∗M , µ∗M ′)
→HomOG⊠DX(µ∗M , µ∗M ′) ≃HomOG⊠DX(pr∗M , pr∗M ′)
≃HomDX(M , pr∗pr∗M ′) ≃HomDX(M , OG(G) ⊗C M ′)
≃OG(G) ⊗HomDX(M , M ′).
Here the last isomorphism follows from the fact that M is coherent.
We can easily see that for any V ∈Mod(G)
HomMod(G)(V, HomDX(M , M ′)) ∼= HomMod(DX,G)(V ⊗M , M ′).
(3.7.1)
Since V →V ⊗M is an exact functor, (3.7.1) implies the following lemma.
Lemma 3.7.1. Let I be an injective object of Mod(DX, G) and M
∈
Mod coh(DX, G). Then HomDX(M , I ) is an injective object of Mod(G).
Let RHom DX(M , • ) be the right derived functor of HomDX(M , • ):
RHom DX( • , • ): Db
coh(DX, G)op × D+(DX, G) →D+(Mod(G)).

172
M. Kashiwara
By (3.7.1) and Lemma 3.7.1, we have
HomD+(DX,G)(V ⊗M , M ′) ∼= HomD+(Mod(G))(V, RHom DX(M , M ′))
(3.7.2)
for V ∈Db(Mod(G)), M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) and M ′ ∈D+(DX, G). In particular
we have
HomD+(DX,G)(M , M ′) ∼= HomD+(Mod(G))(C, RHom DX(M , M ′)).
(3.7.3)
Lemma 3.7.2.
(i) RHom DX( • , • ) sends Db
coh(DX, G)op × Db(DX, G) to
Db(Mod(G)).
(ii) Let F G denote the functors forgetting G-structures:
F G :
Db(DX, G) →Db(DX),
Db(Mod(G)) →Db(C).
Then F G RHom DX(M , N ) ∼= RHom DX(F G M , F G N ) for any M ∈
Db
coh(DX, G) and N ∈Db(DX, G).
Proof.
We may assume that M ∈Db(Mod coh(DX, G)) by Proposi-
tion 3.2.2. Then, for an injective complex N in Mod(DX, G), we have
F G RHom DX(M , N ) ≃HomDX(M , N ) ≃RHom DX(F G M , F G N )
by Proposition 3.3.8. This shows (ii), and (i) follows from the fact that the
global homological dimension of Mod(DX) is at most 2 dim X (see [16]).
Q.E.D.
Remark that this shows that the global homological dimension of Mod(DX, G)
is ﬁnite. Indeed, the arguments of the preceding lemma show that for M ∈
Mod coh(DX, G) and N ∈Mod coh(DX, G), Hn(RHom DX(M , N )) = 0 for
n > 2 dim X. On the other hand, the global homological dimension of Mod(G)
is at most dim G (or more precisely the dimension of the unipotent radical of
G). Thus (3.7.3) shows that
HomD(DX,G)(M , N ) ≃HomD(Mod(G))(C, RHom DX(M , N )) = 0
for n > dim G + 2 dim X. Therefore, the global homological dimension of
Mod coh(DX, G) is at most dim G + 2 dim X. Hence so is Mod(DX, G).
3.8 Relations of Push-forward and Pull-back Functors
Statements
Let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-projective G-manifolds.
Then Df ∗and Df∗are adjoint functors in two ways. We use the notations:
dX/Y = dim X −dim Y .

Theorem 3.8.1. Let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-
projective G-manifolds.
(i) Assume that f is smooth. Then there exists a functorial isomorphism in
M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) and N ∈Db
coh(DY , G) :
HomDb(DY ,G)(N , Df∗M ) ∼= HomDb(DX,G)(Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], M ).
(3.8.1)
(ii) Assume that f is smooth and projective. Then there exists a functorial
isomorphism in M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) and N ∈Db
coh(DY , G) :
HomDb(DY ,G)(Df∗M , N ) ∼= HomDb(DX,G)(M , Df ∗N [dX/Y ]).
(3.8.2)
This theorem will be proved at the end of this subsection.
By Theorem 3.8.1, we obtain the following morphisms for a smooth and
projective morphism f : X →Y , M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) and N ∈Db
coh(DY , G).
Df ∗Df∗M [−dX/Y ] →M ,
(3.8.3)
M →Df ∗Df∗M [dX/Y ],
(3.8.4)
Df∗Df ∗N [dX/Y ] →N ,
(3.8.5)
N →Df∗Df ∗N [−dX/Y ].
(3.8.6)
Residue Morphism
In order to prove Theorem 3.8.1, we shall ﬁrst deﬁne the morphism
Df∗OX[dX/Y ] →OY .
(3.8.7)
Let f : X →Y be a smooth and projective morphism. Let F G be the functor
from Db(DY , G) to Db(DY ). Then we have, by the theory of D-modules
F G(Df∗OX[dX/Y ]) →OY
(3.8.8)
in Db(DY ). This morphism (3.8.8) gives a DY -linear homomorphism
HdX/Y (Df∗OX) →OY .
Since this is canonical, this commutes with the action of any element of G(C).
Hence this is a morphism in Mod(DY , G). On the other hand, we have
Hj(Df∗OX) = 0
for j > dX/Y .
We have therefore a morphism in Db(DY , G).
Df∗OX[dX/Y ] →τ ⩾0(Df∗OX[dX/Y ]) = HdX/Y (Df∗OX).
Therefore, we obtain a morphism Df∗OX[dX/Y ] →OY in Db(DY , G).

M. Kashiwara
Lemma 3.8.2 (Projection formula). There is a functorial isomorphism in
M ∈Db(DX, G) and N ∈Db(DY , G)
Df∗(M
D⊗Df ∗N ) ≃(Df∗M )
D⊗N .
Since this is proved similarly to the non-equivariant case, we omit the proof
(see e.g. [16]).
By this lemma, we obtain the residue morphism:
ResX/Y : Df∗Df ∗N [dX/Y ] →N ,
(3.8.9)
as the compositions of a chain of morphisms
Df∗Df ∗N [dX/Y ] ≃Df∗(OX[dX/Y ]
D⊗Df ∗N )
≃(Df∗OX[dX/Y ])
D⊗N
→OY
D⊗N ≃N .
Proof of Theorem 3.8.1
We shall prove ﬁrst the isomorphism (3.8.1) in Theorem 3.8.1. For N
∈
K+(Mod(DY , G)), we have a quasi-isomorphism
N ←DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
⊗Ω
•
Y ⊗N [dY ]
and a morphism
DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
⊗Ω
•
Y ⊗N →DY ⊗Ω⊗−1
Y
⊗f∗(Ω
•
X ⊗f ∗N )
≃K f∗(f ∗N )[−dX].
Thus we obtain a morphism in Db(DY , G):
N →Df∗Df ∗N [−dX/Y ],
(3.8.10)
even if f is not assumed to be smooth projective. This gives a chain of homo-
morphisms
HomDb(DX,G)(Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], M )
→HomDb(DY ,G)(Df∗Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], Df∗M )
→HomDb(DY ,G)(N , Df∗M ).
Let us prove that the composition is an isomorphism when f is smooth. Sim-
ilarly as above, we have a morphism in D(Mod(G))
RHom DX(Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], M ) →RHom DY (N , Df∗M ).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
175
By the theory of D-modules, forgetting the equivariance, this is an isomor-
phism in Db(C), assuming that f is smooth (see [16]). Hence this is an iso-
morphism in Db(Mod(G)). Finally we obtain by (3.7.3)
HomDb(DX,G)(Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], M )
≃HomDb(Mod(G))

C, RHom DX(Df ∗N [−dX/Y ], M )
	
∼
−−→HomDb(Mod(G))(C, RHom DY (N , Df∗M ))
≃HomDb(DY ,G)(N , Df∗M ).
The proof of (3.8.2) is similar using ResX/Y : Df∗Df ∗N [dX/Y ] →N given
in (3.8.9) instead of (3.8.10).
3.9 Flag Manifold Case
We shall apply Theorem 3.8.1 when X = G/P and Y = {pt}, where P is
a parabolic subgroup of a reductive group G. Note that X is a projective
G-manifold. Then, we obtain the following duality isomorphism.
Lemma 3.9.1. For any ﬁnite-dimensional G-module E and a (g, P)-module
M ﬁnitely generated over U(g), we have an isomorphism
Ext2 dim(G/P )−j
(g,P )
(M, E) ∼= HomC

Extj
(g,P )(E, M), C
	
.
(3.9.1)
Proof.
The category Mod coh(DX, G) is equivalent to the category Mod f(g, P) of
(g, P)-modules ﬁnitely generated over U(g), and Mod coh(DY , G) is equiva-
lent to the category Mod f(G) of ﬁnite-dimensional G-modules (see Proposi-
tion 3.1.5). The functor Df ∗is induced by the functor V →V from Mod(G)
to Mod(g, P). The right adjoint functor to the last functor is given by
M −→⊕
V V ⊗Hom(g,P )(V, M).
(3.9.2)
Here V ranges over the isomorphism classes of irreducible G-modules. Hence
the functor Df∗[−dX/Y ], the right adjoint functor of Df ∗, is the right derived
functor of the functor (3.9.2). Hence (3.8.2) implies that

V
HomD(Mod(G))(V ⊗RHom (g,P )(V, M)[dX], E[j])
≃HomD(Mod(g,P ))(M, E[j][dX]).
The last term is isomorphic to ExtdX+j
(g,P ) (M, E), and the ﬁrst term is isomorphic
to HomC

ExtdX−j
(g,P ) (E, M), C
	
because, when E and V are irreducible, we have
HomD(Mod(G))(V, E[j]) =
*
C
if V ≃E and j = 0,
0
otherwise.

4 Equivariant Derived Category
4.1 Introduction
In the case of quasi-equivariant D-modules, the category has enough objects,
and it is enough to consider the derived category of the abelian category of
quasi-equivariant D-modules. However the categories of equivariant sheaves
have not enough objects, and the derived category of the abelian category
of equivariant sheaves is not an appropriate category. In order to avoid this
diﬃculty, we have to enrich spaces themselves. In this paper, we follow a
deﬁnition of the equivariant derived categories due to Bernstein-Lunts [4].
4.2 Sheaf Case
Let G be a real Lie group and X a (separated) locally compact space with G-
action. We assume that X has a ﬁnite soft dimension (e.g. a ﬁnite-dimensional
topological manifold). We call such an X a G-space. If X is a manifold, we
call it a G-manifold.
In this paper, we say that G acts freely if the morphism ˜µ: G × X →
X × X ((g, x) →(gx, x)) is a closed embedding. Therefore, if X is a G-
manifold with a free action of G, then X/G exists as a (separated) topological
manifold.
Let Mod(CX) be the category of sheaves of C-vector spaces on X. We
denote by Db(CX) the bounded derived category of Mod(CX).
Let µ: G×X →X be the action map and pr: G×X →X the projection.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1. A sheaf F of C-vector spaces is called G-equivariant if it is
endowed with an isomorphism µ−1F ∼
−−→pr−1F satisfying the associative law
as in (3.1.2).
Let us denote by Mod G(CX) the abelian categories of G-equivariant sheaves.
If G acts freely, then we have the equivalence of categories:
Mod(CX/G) ∼
−−→Mod G(CX).
We will construct the equivariant derived category Db
G(CX) which has
suitable functorial properties and satisﬁes the condition:
if G acts freely on X, then Db(CX/G) ≃Db
G(CX).
Assume that there is a sequence of G-equivariant morphisms
V1 −→V2 −→V3 −→· · ·
where Vk is a connected G-manifold with a free action and
(i)
Hn(Vk; C) is ﬁnite-dimensional for any n,k,
(ii)
for each n > 0, Hn(Vk; C) = 0 for k ≫0.
(4.2.1)

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
177
Any real semisimple Lie group with ﬁnite center has such a sequence {Vk}.
If G is embedded in some GLN(C) as a closed subgroup, we can take Vk =
(
f ∈HomC(CN, CN+k) ; f is injective
)
. If G is a connected real semi-simple
group with ﬁnite center, then we can take (G × Vk)/K as Vk, where K is a
maximal compact subgroup of G and Vk is the one for K. Note that G/K is
contractible.
The condition (4.2.1) implies
C ∼
−−→“lim
←−”
k
RΓ(Vk; C).
This follows from the following lemma (see e.g. [19, Exercise 15.1]).
Lemma 4.2.2. Let C be an abelian category. Let {Xn}n∈Z⩾0 be a projective
system in Db(C). Assume that it satisﬁes the conditions:
(i) for any k ∈Z, “lim
←−”
n
Hk(Xn) is representable by an object of C,
(ii) one of the following conditions holds:
(a) there exist a ⩽b such that Hk(Xn) ≃0 for k > b and “lim
←−”
n
Hk(Xn) ≃
0 for k < a,
(b) C has ﬁnite homological dimension, and there exist a ⩽b such that
“lim
←−”
n
Hk(Xn) ≃0 unless a ⩽k ⩽b,
Then “lim
←−”
n
Xn is representable by an object of Db(C).
For example, we say that “lim
←−”
n
Xn is representable by X ∈Db(C) if there
exists an isomorphism lim
−→
n
HomDb(C)(Xn, Y ) ≃HomDb(C)(X, Y ) functorially
in Y ∈Db(C). In such a case, X is unique up to an isomorphism, and we write
X = “lim
←−”
n
Xn.
Let us denote by pk : Vk × X →X the second projection and by πk : Vk ×
X →(Vk × X)/G the quotient map. Here the action of G on Vk × X is the
diagonal action. We denote by the same letter ik the maps Vk×X →Vk+1×X
and (Vk × X)/G →(Vk+1 × X)/G.
Deﬁnition 4.2.3. Let Db
G(CX) be the category whose objects are F


F∞, Fk, jk, ϕk (k = 1, 2, . . .)
	
where F∞∈Db(CX), Fk ∈Db 

commutes. The morphisms in Db
G(CX) are deﬁned in an evident way.
The category Db
G(CX) is a triangulated category in an obvious way, and the
triangulated category Db
G(CX) does not depend on the choice of a sequence
{Vk}k (see [4]). We call Db
G(CX) the equivariant derived category.
By the condition (4.2.1), we have

Indeed, we have

There exists a functor of triangulated categories (called the forgetful func-
tor):
F G : Db
G(CX) →Db(CX).
Note that a morphism u in Db
G(CX) is an isomorphism if and only if F G(u)
is an isomorphism in Db(CX).
By taking the cohomology groups, we obtain cohomological functors:
Hn : Db
G(CX) →Mod G(CX).
Lemma 4.2.4. Assume that G acts freely on X. Then Db
G(CX) is equivalent
to Db(CX/G).

Q.E.D.
Since Mod(CX/G) is equivalent to Mod G(CX) in such a case, we have
if G acts freely on X, then Db(Mod G(CX)) ∼

(4.2.3)
For a G-equivariant map f : X →Y , we can deﬁne the functors
f −1, f ! : Db

Rf!, Rf∗: Db
G(CX) →Db
G(CY ).
The functors Rf! and f −1 are left adjoint functors of f ! and Rf∗, respectively.
Moreover they commute with the forgetful functor Db
G(CX) →Db(CX).

4.3 Induction Functor
The following properties are easily checked.
For a group morphism H →G and a G-manifold X,
there exists a canonical functor (restriction functor)
ResG
H : Db
G(CX) →Db
H(CX).
(4.3.1)
If H is a closed normal subgroup of G and if H acts
freely on a G-manifold X, then
Db
G(CX) ≃Db
G/H(CX/H).
(4.3.2)
For F
∈Db
G(CX), we denote by F/H the corresponding object of
Db
G/H(CX/H).
Let H be a closed subgroup of G and X an H-manifold. Then we have a
chain of equivalences of triangulated categories
Db
H(CX) ≃Db
H×G(CX×G) ≃Db
G(C(X×G)/H)
by (4.3.2). Here H × G acts on X × G by (h, g)(x, g′) = (hx, gg′h−1). Let us
denote the composition by
IndG
H : Db
H(CX) ∼
−−→Db
G(C(X×G)/H).
(4.3.3)
When X is a G-manifold, we have (X × G)/H ≃X × (G/H), and we
obtain an equivalence of categories
IndG
H : Db
H(CX) ∼
−−→Db
G(CX×(G/H))
when X is a G-manifold.
(4.3.4)
Note that the action of G on X × (G/H) is the diagonal action.
4.4 Constructible Sheaves
Assume that X is a complex algebraic variety and a real Lie group G acts
real analytically on the associated complex manifold Xan. We denote by
Db
G,R-c(CXan) the full subcategory of Db
G(CXan) consisting of R-constructible
objects. Here F ∈Db
G(CXan) is called R-constructible if it satisﬁes the follow-
ing two conditions:
(i) dim Hj(F)x < ∞for any x ∈Xan.
(ii) there exists a ﬁnite family {Zα} of locally closed subsets of Xan such
that
(a) Xan = 
α
Zα,

180
M. Kashiwara
(b) each Zα is subanalytic in (X)an for any (or equivalently, some) com-
pactiﬁcation X  →X of X,
(c) Hj(F)|Zα is locally constant .
For subanalyticity and R-constructibility, see e.g. [18].
We say that F is C-constructible (or constructible, for short) if we assume
further that each Zα is the associated topological set of a subscheme of X.
We denote by Db
G, C-c(CXan) the full subcategory of Db
G(CXan) consisting
of constructible objects.
4.5 D-module Case
The construction of the equivariant derived category for sheaves can be applied
similarly to the equivariant derived categories of D-modules.
Let G be an aﬃne algebraic group. Let us take a sequence of connected
algebraic G-manifolds
V1 −→V2 −→V3 −→· · ·
(4.5.1)
such that
G acts freely on Vk, and
for any n > 0, Extn
DVk (OVk, OVk) ∼= Hn(V an
k ; C) = 0 for k ≫0.
(4.5.2)
Such a sequence {Vk}k exists. With the aid of {Vk}k, we can deﬁne the equi-
variant derived category of D-modules similarly to the sheaf case. Let X be
a quasi-projective algebraic G-manifold. Let us denote by pk : Vk × X →X
the second projection and by πk : Vk × X →(Vk × X)/G the quotient mor-
phism.3 We denote by the same letter ik the maps Vk × X →Vk+1 × X and
(Vk × X)/G →(Vk+1 × X)/G.
Deﬁnition 4.5.1. Let Db
G(DX) be the category whose objects are M =

M∞, Mk, jk, ϕk (k ∈Z⩾1)
	
where M∞∈Db(DX), Mk ∈Db 
D(Vk×X)/G
	
and jk : Di∗
kMk+1 ∼
−−→Mk and ϕk : Dp∗

commutes.
3 The quotient (Vk × X)/G may not exist as a scheme, but it exists as an
algebraic space. Although we do not develop here, we have the theory of
D-modules on algebraic spaces. Alternatively, we can use Mod G(DVk×X) instead
of Mod(D(Vk×X)/G).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
181
Note that we have a canonical functor
Db
G(DX) →Db(DX, G).
We denote by Db
G,coh(DX) the full triangulated subcategory of Db
G(DX)
consisting of objects M with coherent cohomologies.
Similarly to the sheaf case, we have the following properties.
For a morphism f : X →Y of quasi-projective G-manifolds,
we can deﬁne the pull-back functor Df ∗: Db
G(DY ) →Db
G(DX)
and the push-forward functor Df∗: Db
G(DX) →Db
G(DY ).
(4.5.3)
The canonical functor Db
G(DX) →Db(DX, G) commutes with
the pull-back and push-forward functors.
(4.5.4)
For a closed algebraic subgroup H of G and an algebraic G-
manifold X, there exists a canonical functor ResG
H : Db
G(DX) →
Db
H(DX).
(4.5.5)
If H is a normal subgroup of G and if H acts freely on X and
if X/H exists, then Db
G(DX) ≃Db
G/H(DX/H).
(4.5.6)
If H is a closed algebraic subgroup of G and X is an algebraic
G-manifold, then we have
IndG
H : Db
H(DX) ∼
−−→Db
G(DX×(G/H)).
(4.5.7)
4.6 Equivariant Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence
Let X be a quasi-projective manifold. Let us denote by Xan the associated
complex manifold. Accordingly, OXan is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on
Xan. Then there exists a morphism of ringed spaces π: Xan →X. We denote
by DXan the sheaf of diﬀerential operators with holomorphic coeﬃcients on
Xan. For a DX-module M , we denote by M an the associated DXan-module
DXan ⊗π−1DX π−1M ≃OXan ⊗π−1OX π−1M .
Let us denote by Db
hol(DX) (resp. Db
rh(DX)) the full subcategory of
Db(DX) consisting of objects with holonomic cohomologies (resp. regular holo-
nomic cohomologies) (see [16]). Then the de Rham functor
DRX := RH om DXan (OXan, • an) : Db(DX) →Db(CX)
sends Db
hol(DX) to Db
C-c(CXan).
Then we have the following Riemann-Hilbert correspondence.
Theorem 4.6.1 ([12]). The functor DRX gives an equivalence of categories:
DRX : Db
rh(DX) ∼
−−→Db
C-c(CXan).
(4.6.1)

182
M. Kashiwara
Now, let G be an aﬃne algebraic group and X a quasi-projective G-
manifold. Then we deﬁne similarly Db
G,hol(DX) and Db
G,rh(DX) as full sub-
categories of Db
G(DX). Then we can deﬁne the equivariant de Rham functor:
DRX : Db
G,hol(DX) →Db
Gan, C-c(CXan).
Theorem 4.6.1 implies the following theorem.
Theorem 4.6.2. The functor DRX gives an equivalence of categories:
DRX : Db
G, rh(DX) ∼
−−→Db
Gan, C-c(CXan).
(4.6.2)
5 Holomorphic Solution Spaces
5.1 Introduction
Let G be an aﬃne complex algebraic group and let X be a quasi-projective
G-manifold. Recall that we denote by Xan the associated complex manifold
and, for a DX-module M , we denote by M an the associated DXan-module
DXan ⊗π−1DX π−1M ≃OXan ⊗π−1OX π−1M . Here π: Xan →X is the canon-
ical morphism of ringed spaces.
Let GR be a real Lie group and let GR →Gan be a morphism of Lie groups.
Hence GR acts on Xan.
Recall that FNGR is the category of Fr´echet nuclear GR-modules (see Ex-
ample 2.1.2 (iii)). We denote by Db
cc(DX, G) the full subcategory of Db(DX, G)
consisting of objects with countably coherent cohomologies, by Db
GR,ctb(CXan)
the full subcategory of Db
GR(CXan) consisting of objects with countable sheaves
as cohomology groups (see § 5.2), and by Db(FNGR) the bounded derived cat-
egory of FNGR.
In this section, we shall deﬁne
RHom DX(M ⊗K, OXan)
as an object of Db(FNGR) for M ∈Db
cc(DX, G) and K ∈Db
GR,ctb(CXan).
Here, we write RHom DX(M ⊗K, OXan) instead of RHom π−1DX(π−1M ⊗
K, OXan) ≃RHom DXan (M an ⊗K, OXan) for short.
We also prove the dual statement. Let DFNGR be the category of dual
Fr´echet nuclear GR-modules. We will deﬁne
R Γc(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DXM )
as an object of Db(DFNGR) for M and K as above. We then prove that
RHom DX(M ⊗K, OXan) and R Γc(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DXM )[dX] are dual to
each other.

5.2 Countable Sheaves
Let X be a topological manifold (countable at inﬁnity).
Proposition 5.2.1. Let F be a sheaf of C-vector spaces on X. Then the fol-
lowing conditions are equivalent.
(i) for any compact subset K of X, Γ(K; F) is countable-dimensional,
(ii) for any compact subset K of X, Hn(K; F) is countable-dimensional for
all n,
(iii) for any x and an open neighborhood U of x, there exists an open neigh-
borhood V of x such that V
⊂U and Im(Γ(U; F) →Γ(V ; F)) is
countable-dimensional,
(iv) there exist a countable family of open subsets {Ui}i of X and an epimor-
phism ⊕iCUi ↠F.
If X is a real analytic manifold, then the above conditions are also equivalent
to
(a) there exist a countable family of subanalytic open subsets {Ui}i of X and
an epimorphism ⊕iCUi ↠F.
Proof. For compact subsets K1 and K2, we have an exact sequence
Hn−1(K1 ∩K2; F) −→Hn(K1 ∪K2; F) −→Hn(K1; F) ⊕Hn(K2; F).
Hence, if K1, K2 and K1 ∩K2, satisfy the condition (i) or (ii), then so does
K1 ∪K2. Hence the conditions (i) and (ii) are local properties. Since the other
conditions are also local, we may assume from the beginning that X is real
analytic.
(ii)⇒(i)⇒(iii) are obvious.
(iii)⇒(iv)
Let us take a countable base of open subsets {Us}s∈S of X. Then,
for each s ∈S, there exists a countable open covering {Vi}i∈I(s) of Us such
that Im(Γ(Us; F) →Γ(Vi; F)) is countable-dimensional. Then the natural
morphism
'
s∈S, i∈I(s)
Im(Γ(Us; F) →Γ(Vi; F)) ⊗CVi →F
is an epimorphism.
(iv)⇒(a) follows from the fact that each CUi is a quotient of a countable direct
sum of sheaves of the form CV with a subanalytic open subset V .
(a)⇒(ii)
We shall prove it by the descending induction on n. Assume that
F satisﬁes the condition (a). Let us take an exact sequence
0 →F ′ →L →F →0,
such that L ≃⊕i CUi for a countable family {Ui}i of subanalytic open
subsets of X. Then, for any relatively compact subanalytic open subset

184
M. Kashiwara
W, Hk(W; CUi) is ﬁnite-dimensional (see e.g. [18]). Hence, the cohomology
group Hk(K; CUi) ∼=
lim
−→
K⊂W
Hk(W; CUi) is countable-dimensional, and so is
Hk(K; L) ≃⊕iHk(K; CUi). Therefore L satisﬁes (i), which implies that F ′
also satisﬁes the condition (i) and hence the condition (a). By the induction
hypothesis, Hn+1(K; F ′) is countable-dimensional. By the exact sequence
Hn(K; L) →Hn(K; F) →Hn+1(K; F ′),
Hn(K; F) is countable-dimensional.
Q.E.D.
Deﬁnition 5.2.2. A sheaf F of complex vector spaces on X is called a count-
able sheaf if F satisﬁes the equivalent conditions in Proposition 5.2.1.
Let us denote by Mod ctb(CX) the full subcategory of Mod(CX) consist-
ing of countable sheaves. Then, Mod ctb(CX) is closed by subobjects, quotients
and extensions. Moreover it is closed by a countable inductive limits. Let us de-
note by Db
ctb(CX) the full subcategory of Db(CX) consisting of objects whose
cohomology groups are countable sheaves. It is a triangulated subcategory of
Db(CX).
Lemma 5.2.3.
(i) If F, F ′ ∈Db
ctb(CX), then F ⊗F ′′ ∈Db
ctb(CX).
(ii) For F ∈Db(CX), the following conditions are equivalent.
(a) F ∈Db
ctb(CX),
(b) Hn(K; F) is countable-dimensional for any compact subset K and
any integer n,
(c) Hn
c (U; F) is countable-dimensional for any open subset U and any
integer n.
(iii) Let f : X →Y be a continuous map of topological manifolds. Then
Rf!F ∈Db
ctb(CY ) for any F ∈Db
ctb(CX).
Proof. (i) follows from (iv) in Proposition 5.2.1.
(ii)
(b)⇒(c)
If U is relatively compact, it follows from the exact sequence
Hn−1(K \ U; F) →Hn
c (U; F) →Hn(K; F) for a compact set K ⊃U, and if
U is arbitrary, it follows from Hn
c (U; F) = lim
−→
V ⊂⊂U
Hn
c (V ; F).
(c)⇒(b) follows from the exact sequence
Hn
c (X; F) →Hn(K; F) →Hn+1
c
(X \ K; F).
(a)⇒(b)
Let us show that Hn(K; τ ⩽kF) is countable-dimensional by the in-
duction on k. If Hn(K; τ ⩽k−1F) is countable-dimensional, the exact sequence
Hn(K; τ ⩽k−1F) →Hn(K; τ ⩽kF) →Hn−k(K; Hk(F))
shows that Hn(K; τ ⩽kF) is countable-dimensional.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
185
(b)⇒(a) We shall show that Hk(F) is a countable sheaf by the induction on
k. Assume that τ <kF ∈Db
ctb(CX). Then, for any compact subset K, we have
the exact sequence
Hn(K; F) →Hn(K; τ ⩾kF)) →Hn+1(K; τ <kF).
Since Hn+1(K; τ <kF) is countable-dimensional by (a)⇒(b), Hn(K; τ ⩾kF))
is also countable-dimensional. In particular, Γ(K; Hk(F)) = Hk(K; τ ⩾kF) is
countable-dimensional.
(iii)
For any open subset V
of Y , Hn
c (V ; Rf!F) ≃Hn
c (f −1(V ); F) is
countable-dimensional.
Q.E.D.
The following lemma is immediate.
Lemma 5.2.4. Let F be a countable sheaf and let H ↠F be an epimorphism.
Then there exist a countable sheaf F ′ and a morphism F ′ →H such that the
composition F ′ →H →F is an epimorphism.
By Lemma 5.2.4, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2.5. The functor Db(Mod ctb(CX)) →Db
ctb(CX) is an equivalence
of triangulated categories.
More precisely, we have the following.
Lemma 5.2.6. Let F be a bounded complex of sheaves such that all the co-
homology groups are countable. Then we can ﬁnd a bounded complex F ′ of
countable sheaves and a quasi-isomorphism F ′ →F.
If a Lie group G acts on a real analytic manifold X, we denote by
Mod G,ctb(CX) the category of G-equivariant sheaves of C-vector spaces which
are countable.
Remark 5.2.7. A sheaf F of C-vector spaces on X is not necessarily count-
able even if Fx is ﬁnite-dimensional for all x ∈X. Indeed, the sheaf ⊕x∈XC{x}
on X is such an example.
5.3 C∞-Solutions
Let X, G and GR be as in § 5.1. Let XR be a real analytic submanifold of Xan
invariant by the GR-action such that TxX ∼= C ⊗R TxXR for any x ∈XR. Let
M be a diﬀerentiable GR-manifold. Let us denote by C ∞
XR×M the sheaf of C∞-
functions on XR × M. Then, C ∞
XR×M is an f −1DX-module, where f : Xan ×
M →X is a canonical map. For M ∈Mod(DX) and K ∈Mod(CXR×M), we
write HomDX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
instead of Homf −1DX

f −1M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
for short.
Lemma 5.3.1. For any countable sheaf K on XR × M and a countably co-
herent DX-module M , HomDX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
has a structure of Fr´echet
nuclear space.

186
M. Kashiwara
Proof. The topology is the weakest topology such that, for any open subset
U of X, any open subset V of (U an ∩XR)×M and s ∈Γ(U; M ), t ∈Γ(V ; K),
the homomorphism
HomDX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
∋ϕ →ϕ(s ⊗t) ∈C∞(V )
(5.3.1)
is a continuous map. Here, C∞(V ) is the space of C∞-functions on V .
There exist a countable index set A and a family of open subsets {Ua}a∈A
of X, open subsets {Va}a∈A of XR × M and sa ∈Γ(Ua; M ), ta ∈Γ(Va; K)
satisfying the following properties:
(i) Va ⊂U an
a × M,
(ii) {sa}a∈A generates M , namely, Mx = 
x∈Ua(DX)x(sa)x for any x ∈X,
(iii) {ta}a∈A generates K, namely, Kx ≃
x∈Va C(ta)x for any x ∈XR × M.
Then by the morphisms (5.3.1), {sa} and {ta} induce an injection
HomDX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
↣

a∈A
C∞(Va).
We can easily see that its image is a closed subspace of %
a∈A C∞(Va), and
the induced topology coincides with the weakest topology introduced in the
beginning. Since C∞(Va) is a Fr´echet nuclear space and a countable product
of Fr´echet nuclear spaces is also a Fr´echet nuclear space, %
a∈A C∞(Va) is a
Fr´echet nuclear space. Hence, its closed subspace HomDX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
is also a Fr´echet nuclear space.
Q.E.D.
Let E (p,q,r)
Xan×M denote the sheaf of diﬀerential forms on Xan × M with C∞-
coeﬃcients which are (p, q)-forms with respect to Xan, and r-forms with
respect to M. We set E (0,n)
Xan×M = ⊕n=q+rE (0,q,r)
Xan×M. Then E (0, • )
Xan×M is a com-
plex of p−1DXan-modules, and it is quasi-isomorphic to p−1OXan, where
p: Xan × M →Xan is the projection.
Lemma 5.3.2. For any K ∈Mod GR,ctb(CXan×M) and M ∈Mod cc(DX, G),
HomDX

M ⊗K, E (0,q)
Xan×M
	
has a Fr´echet nuclear GR-module structure.
The proof is similar to the previous lemma.
We denote by Homtop
DX

M ⊗K, C ∞
XR×M
	
and Homtop
DX

M ⊗K, E (0,n)
Xan×M
	
the
corresponding space endowed with the Fr´echet nuclear GR-module structure.
5.4 Deﬁnition of RHomtop
Let us take a diﬀerentiable GR-manifold M with a free GR-action. Then we
have an equivalence of categories:
Mod GR(CXan×M)
≃
Mod(C(Xan×M)/GR)


Mod GR,ctb(CXan×M) ≃Mod ctb(C(Xan×M)/GR).

Deﬁnition 5.4.1. A countable GR-equivariant sheaf K on Xan × M is called
standard if K is isomorphic to '
j∈J
(Ej)Uj, where {Uj}j∈J is a countable family
of GR-invariant open subsets of Xan × M and Ej is a GR-equivariant local
system on Uj of ﬁnite rank. Note the (Ej)Uj is the extension of Ej to the
sheaf on Xan × M such that (Ej)Uj|(Xan×M)\Uj = 0.
Let us denote by Mod GR,stand(CXan×M) the full additive subcategory of
Mod GR(CXan×M) consisting of standard sheaves. With this terminology, we
obtain the following lemma by (5.4.1) and Proposition 5.2.1.
Lemma 5.4.2. For any K ∈C−
Mod GR(CXan×M)
	
with countable sheaves
as cohomologies, there exist K′ ∈C−
Mod GR,stand(CXan×M)
	
and a quasi-
isomorphism K′ →K in C−
Mod GR(CXan×M)
	
.
Similarly we introduce the following notion.
Deﬁnition 5.4.3. A countably coherent quasi-G-equivariant DX-module M
is called standard if M is isomorphic to DX ⊗OX E where E is a countably
coherent locally free G-equivariant OX-module.
Let Mod stand(DX, G) denote the full additive subcategory of Mod(DX, G)
consisting of standard modules.
For K ∈Kb 
Mod GR,ctb(CXan×M)
	
and M ∈Kb 
Mod cc(DX, G)
	
, we
deﬁned the complex Homtop
DX

M ⊗K, E (0, • )
Xan×M
	
of Fr´echet nuclear GR-modules
in Lemma 5.3.2.
Lemma 5.4.4.
(i) Let N ∈Mod stand(DX) and L ∈Mod stand(CXan×M).
Then, we have
Extj
DX(N ⊗L, E (0,q)
Xan×M) = 0
for any j ̸= 0 and any q.
(ii) We have isomorphisms in Db(C):
HomDX(M ⊗K, E (0, • )
Xan×M) ∼
−−→RHom DX(M ⊗K, E (0, • )
Xan×M)
≃RHom DX(M ⊗K, p−1OXan)
for M ∈K−(Mod stand(DX)) and K ∈K−(Mod stand(CXan×M)). Here
p: Xan × M →Xan is the projection.
Proof. (i)
Since N is a locally free DX-module and E (0,q)
Xan×M is a soft sheaf,
we have E xtj
DX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M) = 0 for j ̸= 0. Hence, RH om DX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M)
is represented by HomDX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M). Since HomDX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M) has
locally a C ∞
Xan×M-module structure, it is a soft sheaf. Hence, we obtain
Extj
DX(L, HomDX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M)) = 0 for j ̸= 0. Finally, we conclude that
HomC(L, HomDX(N , E (0,q)
Xan×M)) represents

(ii) follows immediately from (i).

Proposition 5.4.5. Let us assume that K ∈Kb
Mod GR,ctb(CXan×M)

M ∈Kb 
Mod cc(DX, G)
	
. Then,

isomorphisms in K−
Mod cc(DX, G)
	
and K′ →K ranges over the quasi-
isomorphisms in K−
Mod GR,ctb(CXan×M)
	
. Moreover, forgetting the topology
and the equivariance, it is isomorphic to RHom DX(M ⊗K, p−1OXan). Here
p: Xan × M →Xan is the projection.
Proof. There exist M ′ ∈K−(Mod stand(DX, G)) and a quasi-isomorphism
M ′ →M . Similarly by Lemma 5.4.2, there exist K′ ∈K−(Mod GR,stand(CX))
and a quasi-isomorphism K′ →K.
Then
HomDX(M ′ ⊗K′, E (0, • )
Xan×M) →RHom DX(M ⊗K, p−1OXan)
(5.4.2)
is an isomorphism in D(C) by the preceding lemma.
To complete the proof, it is enough to remark that, if a morphism in
K(FNGR) is a quasi-isomorphism in K(Mod(C)) forgetting the topology and
the equivariance, then it is a quasi-isomorphism in K(FNGR).
Q.E.D.
Deﬁnition 5.4.6. Assume that GR acts freely on M. For M ∈Db
cc(DX, G)

of Db(FNGR). Here, M ′ ranges over the set of objects of K−

isomorphic to M in Dcc(DX, G), and K′ ranges over the set of objects of
K−

isomorphic to K in D

Let us take a sequence of GR-manifolds with a free GR-action:
V1 −→V2 −→V3 −→· · ·
(5.4.3)
as in (4.2.1).
Lemma 5.4.7. For M ∈Db

DX(M ⊗p−1

5.5 DFN Version
In this subsection, let us deﬁne R Γtop
c
(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DXM ), which is the
dual of RHomtop
DX(M ⊗K, OXan). Since the construction is similar to the one
of RHomtop
DX(M ⊗K, OXan), we shall be brief.
Let us denote by Dist(p,q)
Xan the sheaf of (p, q)-forms on Xan with distrib-
utions as coeﬃcients. Then for any open subset U of Xan, Γc(U; Dist(p,q)
Xan )
is endowed with a DFN-topology and it is the dual topological space of
the FN-space E (dX−p,dX−q)
Xan
(U). Hence for M ∈K−(Mod stand(DX)) and
F ∈K−(Mod stand(CXan)), Γc(Xan; K ⊗Dist(dX, • )
Xan
⊗DX M )[dX] is a com-
plex of DFN-spaces, and it is the dual of Homtop
DX(M ⊗K, E (0, • )
Xan ). We
denote by Γtop
c
(Xan; K ⊗Dist(dX, • )
Xan
⊗DX M ) the complex of DFN-spaces
Γc(Xan; K ⊗Dist(dX, • )
Xan
⊗DX M ). If we forget the topology, it is isomorphic
to R Γc(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan ⊗DX M ) ∈Db(C). Thus we have deﬁned a functor:
R Γtop
c
(Xan; • ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DX • ): Db
ctb(CXan) × Db
cc(DX) →Db(DFN).
When X is a quasi-projective G-manifold, we can deﬁne its equivariant version

190
M. Kashiwara
R Γtop
c
(Xan; • ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DX • ): Db
GR,ctb(CXan) × Db
cc(DX, G) →Db(DFNGR).
We have
R Γtop
c
(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan
L⊗DXM )[dX] ∼=

RHomtop
DX(M ⊗K, OXan)
	∗.
(5.5.1)
Here ( • )∗: Db(FNGR)op ∼
−−→Db(DFNGR) is the functor induced by the du-
ality.
If we forget the topology and the equivariance, R Γtop
c
(Xan; K⊗ΩXan ⊗DX
M ) is isomorphic to R Γc(Xan; K ⊗ΩXan ⊗DX M ) ∈Db(C).
5.6 Functorial Properties of RHomtop
Statements
We shall study how RHomtop behaves under G-equivariant morphisms of
G-manifolds. We shall keep the notations G, GR as in § 5.1.
Let f : X →Y be a G-equivariant morphism of quasi-projective algebraic
G-manifolds. Let f an : Xan →Y an be the associated holomorphic map.
Theorem 5.6.1.
(i) Assume that f is smooth and projective. Then, there
exists a canonical isomorphism in Db(FNGR):
RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(f an)−1L, OXan) ≃RHomtop
DY (Df∗M ⊗L, OY an) [−dX/Y ]
for M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) and L ∈Db
GR,ctb(CY ).
(ii) Assume that f is smooth. Then, there exists a canonical isomorphism in
Db(FNGR):
RHomtop
DY (N ⊗R(f an)!K, OY an) ≃RHomtop
DX(Df ∗N ⊗K, OXan)[2dX/Y ]
for N ∈Db
coh(DY , G) and K ∈Db
GR,ctb(CX).
Preparation
Let us take a sequence {Vk} as in (4.2.1).
Let N ∈Db
cc(DY , G) and L ∈Db
GR,ctb(CY an). Then, by the deﬁnition, we
have
RHomtop
DY (N ⊗(L □× CVk), E (0, • )
Y an×Vk) = “lim
−→”
N ′,L′
Homtop
DY (N ′ ⊗L′, E (0, • )
Y an×Vk).
Here, N ′ ranges over the objects of K−
Mod cc(DY , G)
	
isomorphic to N in
D(Mod(DY , G)), and L′ ranges over the objects of K−
Mod GR,ctb(CY an×Vk)
	
isomorphic to L □× CVk in Db
GR,ctb(CY an×Vk). Then the morphism

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
191
DX→Y ⊗
DY
E (0, • )
Y an×Vk →E (0, • )
Xan×Vk
induces morphisms in Db(FNGR):
Homtop
DY (N ′ ⊗L′, E (0, • )
Y an×Vk) →Homtop
DX(f ∗N ′ ⊗(f an × idVk)−1L′, E (0, • )
Xan×Vk)
→RHomtop
DX

Df ∗N ⊗((f an)−1L □× CVk), E (0, • )
Xan×Vk
	
.
Thus we obtain a morphism
RHomtop
DY (N ⊗(L □× CVk), E (0, • )
Y an×Vk)
→RHomtop
DX(Df ∗N ⊗((f an)−1L □× CVk), E (0, • )
Xan×Vk)
for N ∈Db
cc(DY , G) and L ∈Db
GR,ctb(CYan). Taking the projective limit with
respect to k, we obtain
RHomtop
DY (N ⊗L, OY an) →RHomtop
DX(Df ∗N ⊗(f an)−1L, OXan).
(5.6.1)
Here, f is arbitrary.
Proof of Theorem 5.6.1
Let us ﬁrst prove (i). For M and L as in (i), we have morphisms
RHomtop
DY

Df∗M ⊗L[dX/Y ], OY an	
→RHomtop
DX

Df ∗Df∗M [dX/Y ] ⊗(f an)−1L, OXan	
→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(f an)−1L, OXan).
Here, the ﬁrst arrow is given by (5.6.1) and the last arrow is given by M →
Df ∗Df∗M [dX/Y ] (see (3.8.4)).
We shall prove that the composition
RHomtop
DY

Df∗M [dX/Y ] ⊗L, OY an	
→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(f an)−1L, OXan)
is an isomorphism in Db(FNGR).
In order to see this, it is enough to show that it is an isomorphism in
Db(C). Then the result follows from the result of D-modules:
R HomDY

Df∗M [dX/Y ], OY an	 ∼= R(f an)∗R HomDX(M , OXan).
The proof of (ii) is similar. Let N and K be as in (ii), then we have a
sequence of morphisms
RHomtop
DY (N ⊗Rf an
!K, OY an)
→RHomtop
DX(Df ∗N ⊗(f an)−1Rf an
!K, OXan)

192
M. Kashiwara
→RHomtop
DX(Df ∗N ⊗K, OXan)[2dX/Y ].
Here the last arrow is obtained by
K →(f an)!R(f an)!K ∼= (f an)−1R(f an)!K[2dX/Y ].
The rest of arguments is similar to the proof of (i) by reducing it to the
corresponding result in the D-module theory:
RH om DX(Df ∗N , OXan) ≃(f an)−1 RH om DY (N , OY an).
5.7 Relation with the de Rham Functor
Let X be an algebraic G-manifold. First assume that G acts freely on X.
Let p: X →X/G be the projection. Let M
∈Db
cc(DX, G) and K ∈
Db
GR,ctb(CXan). Let L be an object of Db
G,hol(DX). Let L /G be the object
of Db
hol(DX/G) corresponding to L . Set L = DRX(L ) ∈Db
Gan, C-c(CXan) (see
Subsection 4.6). Then the corresponding object L/Gan ∈Db
C-c(C(X/G)an) is
isomorphic to DRX/G(L /G).
Let us represent M by an object of K−
stand(DX, G) and L /G by an object
&
L ∈K−(Mod stand(DX/G)). Then L is represented by p∗&
L . Since L/Gan ≃
HomD(X/G)an(D(X/G)an ⊗
•5 Θ(X/G)an, &
L an) belongs to Db
ctb(C(X/G)an), there
exist F ∈K−(Mod stand(C(X/G)an)) and a quasi-isomorphism
F →HomD(X/G)an(D(X/G)an ⊗
•6
Θ(X/G)an, &
L an)
by Lemma 5.2.6. Thus we obtain a morphism of complexes of D(X/G)an-
modules:
D(X/G)an ⊗
•6
Θ(X/G)an ⊗F →&
L an.
(5.7.1)
Let M be a diﬀerentiable manifold with a free GR-action. Then for any E ∈
K−
GR,stand(CXan×M), the morphism (5.7.1) induces morphisms
Homtop
DX(M ⊗OX L ⊗E, E (0, • )

On the other hand, we have an isomorphism in Db(FNGR):

because M ⊗p−1OX/G p−1(DX/G ⊗5 • ΘX/G) →M is a quasi-isomorphism,
and M ⊗p−1OX/G p−1(DX/G ⊗5 • ΘX/G) and (pan)−1F ⊗E are standard

for M ∈Db

G,hol(DX) and E ∈Db
GR,ctb(CXan×M).
Let us take a sequence {Vk} as in (4.2.1). Let K ∈Db
GR,ctb(CXan). Setting
M = Vk, E = K ⊠CVk in (5.7.2), and then taking the projective limit with
respect to k, we obtain
RHomtop
DX((M
D⊗L ) ⊗K, OXan)
→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(DRX(L ) ⊗K), OXan).
(5.7.3)
When the action of G is not free, we can also deﬁne the morphism (5.7.3)
replacing X with Vk × X, and then taking the projective limit with respect
to k. Here {Vk} is as in (4.5.1). Thus we obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 5.7.1. Let M ∈Db
cc(DX, G) and K ∈Db
GR,ctb(CXan). Then for any
L ∈Db
G,hol(DX), there exists a canonical morphism in Db(FNGR) :
RHomtop
DX

(M
D⊗L ) ⊗K, OXan	
→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(DRX(L ) ⊗K), OXan).
For a coherent DX-module N , let us denote by Ch(N ) ⊂T ∗X the char-
acteristic variety of N (see [16]). For a submanifold Y of X, we denote by
T ∗
Y X the conormal bundle to Y . In particular, T ∗
XX is nothing but the zero
section of the cotangent bundle T ∗X.
Theorem 5.7.2. Let M ∈Db
coh(DX, G), L ∈Db
G,hol(DX). Assume that M
and L are non-characteristic, i.e.
Ch(M ) ∩Ch(L ) ⊂T ∗
XX.
(5.7.4)
Then, for any K ∈Db
GR,ctb(CXan), we have an isomorphism in Db(FNGR):
RHomtop
DX((M
D⊗L )⊗K, OXan) ∼
−−→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗(DRX(L )⊗K), OXan).

194
M. Kashiwara
Proof.
It is enough to show the result forgetting the topology and the
equivariance. Then this follows from the well-known result
RH om DX(M
D⊗L , OXan)
∼
←−−RH om DX(M , OXan) ⊗C RH om DX(L , OXan)

−−→RH om C

DRX(L ), RH om DX(M , OXan)
	
∼
−−→RH om DX(M ⊗DRX(L ), OXan).
Here, the ﬁrst and the third isomorphisms need the non-characteristic condi-
tion (see [18]).
Q.E.D.
6 Whitney Functor
6.1 Whitney Functor
In § 5, we deﬁned RHomtop
DX(M ⊗K, OXan) as an object of Db(FNGR). In this
section, we introduce its C∞-version. We use the Whitney functor developed
in Kashiwara-Schapira [20].
Theorem 6.1.1 ([20]). Let M be a real analytic manifold. Then there exists
an exact functor
•
w⊗C ∞
M : Mod R-c(CM) →Mod(DM).
Moreover, for any F ∈Mod R-c(CM), Γ(M; F
w⊗C ∞
M ) is endowed with a Fr´echet
nuclear topology, and
Γ(M; •
w⊗C ∞
M ) : Mod R-c(CM) →FN
is an exact functor.
Remark 6.1.2.
(i) For a subanalytic open subset U, Γ(M; CU
w⊗C ∞
M ) is
the set of C∞-functions f deﬁned on M such that all the derivatives of
f vanish at any point outside U. Its topology is the induced topology of
C∞(M).
(ii) For a closed real analytic submanifold N of M, the sheaf CN
w⊗C ∞
M is
isomorphic to the completion lim
←−
n
C ∞
M /In, where I is the ideal of C ∞
M
consisting of C∞-functions vanishing on N.
(iii) In this paper, the Whitney functor is used only for the purpose of the
construction of the morphism in Proposition 6.3.2. However, with this
functor and Thom (see [20]), we can construct the C∞-globalization and
the distribution globalization of Harish-Chandra modules.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
195
Hence we can deﬁne the functor
•
w⊗C ∞
M : Db
R-c(CM) →Db(DM),
R Γtop(M; •
w⊗C ∞
M ) : Db
R-c(CM) →Db(FN).
For any F ∈Mod R-c(CM), we have a morphism
F
w⊗C ∞
M →HomC(HomC(F, CM), C ∞
M ),
which induces a morphism in Db(FN)
R Γtop(M; F
w⊗C ∞
M ) −→RHomtop
C (F ∗, C ∞
M )
(6.1.1)
for F ∈Db
R-c(CM), where F ∗:= RH om (F, CM).
If a real Lie group H acts on M, we can deﬁne
Γtop(M; •
w⊗C ∞
M ) : Mod H,R-c(CM) →FNH.
Note that, for a complex manifold X and F ∈Db
R-c(CX), F
w⊗OX ∈
Db(DX) is deﬁned as F
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan .
6.2 The Functor RHomtop
DX( • , •
w
⊗OXan)
Let X, G, GR be as in § 5.1.
For M ∈Db
cc(DX, G), F ∈Db
GR,R-c(CX), let us deﬁne RHomtop
DX(M , F
w⊗
OXan) as an object of Db(FNGR), which is isomorphic to RHom DX(M , F
w⊗
OXan) forgetting the topology and the equivariance. The construction is sim-
ilar to the one in § 5.
Let M be a GR-manifold with a free GR-action. For M ∈Mod cc(DX, G)
and F ∈Mod GR,R-c(CXan×M), we endow HomDX(M , F
w⊗E (0,p)
Xan×M) with a
Fr´echet nuclear GR-module structure as in Lemma 5.3.1. Hence, for M ∈
K−(Mod cc(DX, G)) and F ∈K−(Mod GR,R-c(CXan×M)), we can regard the
complex HomDX(M , F
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×M) as an object of Db(FNGR). Taking the
inductive limit with respect to M , we obtain RHomtop
DX(M , F
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×M) ∈
Db(FNGR) for M ∈Db
cc(DX, G) and F ∈Db
GR,R-c(CXan×M).
Let us take a sequence {Vk} as in (4.2.1). Let M ∈Db
cc(DX, G) and
F ∈Db
GR,R-c(CXan). Forgetting the topology and the equivariance, we have
RHomtop
DX(M , (F □× CVk)
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×Vk)
≃RHom DX(M , F
w⊗OXan) ⊗R Γ(Vk; C)
in Db(C).

196
M. Kashiwara
As in Deﬁnition 5.4.8, we deﬁne
RHomtop
DX(M , F
w⊗OXan) = τ ⩽a RHomtop
DX(M , (F □× CVk)
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×Vk)
for k ≫a ≫0.
Thus we have deﬁned the functor
RHomtop
DX( • , •
w⊗OXan)
: Db
cc(DX, G)op × Db
GR,R-c(CXan) →Db(FNGR).
(6.2.1)
By (6.1.1), we have a morphism
RHomtop
DX(M , F
w⊗OXan) →RHomtop
DX(M ⊗F ∗, OXan)
(6.2.2)
in Db(FNGR).
6.3 Elliptic Case
Let XR be a closed real analytic submanifold of Xan invariant by GR. Let
i: XR  →Xan be the inclusion.
Assume that TxX ∼= C ⊗R TxXR for any x ∈XR.
In Lemma 5.3.2, we deﬁne Homtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR) ∈FNGR for a countably
coherent quasi-G-equivariant DX-module M . It is right derivable and we can
deﬁne the functor
RHomtop
DX( • , C ∞
XR) : Db
cc(DX, G)op →Db(FNGR).
Proposition 6.3.1. For M ∈Db
cc(DX, G), we have
RHomtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR) ≃RHomtop
DX(M , i∗CXR
w⊗OXan).
Proof. Let {Vk} be as in the preceding section. The restriction map
(i∗CXR □× CVk)
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×Vk →E (0, • )
XR×Vk
induces Homtop
DX(M , (i∗CXR □× CVk)
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×Vk) →Homtop
DX(M , E (0, • )
XR×Vk) in
Db(FNGR). It induces a morphism
RHomtop
DX(M , (i∗CXR □× CVk)
w⊗E (0, • )
Xan×Vk) →RHomtop
DX(M , E (0, • )
XR×Vk).
Taking the projective limit with respect to k, we obtain
RHomtop
DX(M , i∗CXR
w⊗OXan) →RHomtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR).
Forgetting the topology and the equivariance, it is an isomorphism since
i∗CXR
w⊗OXan ≃C ∞
XR (see [20]).
Q.E.D.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
197
Proposition 6.3.2. There exists a canonical morphism in Db(FNGR):
RHomtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR) −→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗i∗i!CXan, OXan)
for M ∈Db
cc(DX, G).
Proof.
This follows from the preceding proposition, (i∗CXR)∗≃i∗i!CXan
and (6.2.2).
Q.E.D.
Proposition 6.3.3. Let us assume that M ∈Db
coh(DX, G) is elliptic i.e.
Ch(M ) ∩T ∗
XRX ⊂T ∗
XX (cf. e.g. [16]). Then we have
RHomtop
DX(M , C ∞
XR) ∼
−−→RHomtop
DX(M ⊗i∗i!CXan, OXan)
in Db(FNGR).
Proof. Let BXR = RH om C(i∗i!CXan, OXan) be the sheaf of hyperfunc-
tions on XR. Forgetting the topology and the equivariance, we have isomor-
phisms:
RHom DX(M ⊗i∗i!CXan, OXan) ≃RHom DX(M , BXR)
≃RHom DX(M , C ∞
XR).
Here, the last isomorphism follows from the ellipticity of M . Hence we obtain
the desired result.
Q.E.D.
7 Twisted Sheaves
7.1 Twisting Data
If we deal with the non-integral inﬁnitesimal character case in the representa-
tion theory by a geometric method, we need to twist sheaves. In this note, we
shall not go into a systematic study of twisted sheaves, but introduce it here
in an ad hoc manner by using the notion of twisting data. (See [15] for more
details.)
A twisting data τ (for twisting sheaves) over a topological space X is a
triple (X0
π−→X, L, m). Here π: X0 →X is a continuous map admitting a
section locally on X, L is an invertible CX0×XX0-module and m is an isomor-
phism
m: p−1
12 L ⊗p−1
23 L ∼
−−→p−1
23 L
on X2.
Here and hereafter, we denote by Xn the ﬁber product of (n+1) copies of X0
over X, by pi (i = 1, 2) the i-th projection from X1 to X0, by pij (i, j = 1, 2, 3)

198

In other words, for (x1, x2, x3) ∈X0 ×X X0 ×X X0, an isomorphism
m(x1, x2, x3): L(x1,x2) ⊗L(x2,x3) ∼
−−→L(x1,x3)
is given in a locally constant manner in (x1, x2, x3) such that the diagram
L(x1,x2) ⊗L(x2,x3) ⊗L(x3,x4)
m(x1,x2,x3)⊗L(x3,x4)

m(x1,x2,x4)
																
L(x1,x4)
is commutative for (x1, x2, x3, x4) ∈X0 ×X X0 ×X X0 ×X X0.
In particular, we have i−1L ∼= CX0, where i: X0  →X1 is the diagonal
embedding. Indeed, for x′ ∈X0, m(x′, x′, x′) gives L(x′,x′)⊗L(x′,x′) ∼
−−→L(x′,x′)
and hence an isomorphism L(x′,x′) ∼
−−→C.
7.2 Twisted Sheaf
Let τ = (X0
π−→X, L, m) be a twisting data on X. A twisted sheaf F on X
with twist τ (or simply τ-twisted sheaf) is a sheaf F on X0 equipped with an

In particular, F is locally constant on each ﬁber of π. We can similarly
deﬁne a twisted sheaf on an open subset U of X. Let Mod τ(CU) denote the
category of τ-twisted sheaves on U. Then Modτ(CX): U →Mod τ(CU) is a
stack (a sheaf of categories) on X (see e.g. [19]).
If π: X0 →X admits a section s: X →X0, then the category Mod τ(CX)
is equivalent to the category Mod(CX) of sheaves on X. Indeed, the functor
Mod τ(CX) →Mod(CX) is given by F →s−1F and the quasi-inverse is given
by G →˜s−1L ⊗π−1G, where ˜s is the map x′ →

x′, sπ(x′)
	
from X0 to
X1. Hence the stack Modτ(CX) is locally equivalent to the stack Mod(CX)
of sheaves on X. Conversely, a stack locally equivalent to the stack Mod(CX)
is equivalent to Modτ(CX) for some twisting data τ (see [15]).
Let τtriv be the twisting data (X
id
−→X, CX). Then Mod τtriv(CX) is equiv-
alent to Mod(CX).
For a twisting data τ on X, we denote by Db
τ(CX) the bounded derived
category Db(Mod τ(CX)).
7.3 Morphism of Twisting Data
Let τ = (X0
π−→X, L, m) and τ ′ = (X′
0
π′
−→X, L′, m′) be two twisting data.
A morphism from τ to τ ′ is a pair u = (f, ϕ) of a map f : X0 →X′
0 over
X and an isomorphism ϕ: L ∼
−−→f1−1L′ compatible with m and m′. Here f1
is the map f ×
X f : X0 ×
X X0 →X′
0 ×
X X′
0. One can easily see that a morphism
u: τ →τ ′ gives an equivalence of categories u∗: Mod τ ′(CX) ∼
−−→Mod τ(CX)
by F →f −1F. Hence we say that twisting data τ and τ ′ are equivalent in
this case.
Let us discuss brieﬂy what happens if there are two morphisms u = (f, ϕ)
and u′ = (f ′, ϕ′) from τ to τ ′. Let g: X0 →X′
0 ×
X X′
0 be the map x′ →

f(x′), f ′(x′)
	
. Then the invertible sheaf K′ = g−1L′ on X0 satisﬁes p−1
1 K′ ∼=
p−1
2 K′, and there exists an invertible sheaf K on X such that

200
M. Kashiwara
π−1K ∼= g−1L′.
Then,
• ⊗K gives an equivalence from Mod τ(CX) to itself, and the diagram

quasi-commutes (i.e. ( • ⊗K) ◦u′∗and u∗are isomorphic).
7.4 Tensor Product
Let τ ′ = (X′
0 →X, L′, m′) and τ ′′ = (X′′
0 →X, L′′, m′′) be two twisting data
on X. Then their tensor product τ ′ ⊗τ ′′ is deﬁned as follows: τ ′ ⊗τ ′′ = (X0 →
X, L, m), where X0 = X′
0 ×
X X′′
0 , L = q−1
1 L′ ⊗q−1
2 L′′ with the projections
q1 : X1 ≃X′
1 × X′′
1 →X′
1 and q2 : X1 →X′′
1 , and m = m′ ⊗m′′. Then we can
deﬁne the bi-functor
• ⊗•: Modτ ′(CX) × Modτ ′′(CX) →Modτ ′⊗τ ′′(CX)
(7.4.1)
by (F ′, F ′′) →r−1
1 F ′ ⊗r−1
2 F ′′, where r1 : X0 →X′
0 and r2 : X0 →X′′
0 are the
projections.
For a twisting data τ = (X0 →X, L, m), let τ ⊗−1 be the twisting data
τ ⊗−1 := (X0 →X, L⊗−1, m⊗−1). Note that L⊗−1 ≃r−1L, where r: X1 →
X1 is the map (x′, x′′) →(x′′, x′). Then we can easily see that τ ⊗τ ⊗−1 is
canonically equivalent to the trivial twisting data. Hence we obtain
• ⊗• : Modτ(CX) × Modτ ⊗−1(CX) →Mod(CX).
For twisting data τ and τ ′, we have a functor
Hom( • , • ) : Modτ(CX)op × Modτ ′(CX) →Modτ ⊗−1⊗τ ′(CX).
(7.4.2)
They induce functors:
• ⊗• : Db
τ(CY ) ⊗Db
τ ′(CY ) →Db
τ⊗τ ′(CY )
and
RH om ( • , • ) : Db
τ(CY )op × Db
τ ′(CY ) →Db
τ ⊗−1⊗τ ′(CY ).
(7.4.3)
7.5 Inverse and Direct Images
Let f : X →Y be a continuous map and let τ = (Y0
π−→Y, LY , mY ) be a
twisting data on Y . Then one can deﬁne naturally the pull-back f ∗τ. This is
the twisting data (X0 →X, LX, mX) on X, where X0 is the ﬁber product

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
201
X ×Y Y0, LX is the inverse image of LY by the map X1 →Y1 and mX is the
isomorphism induced by mY .
Then, similarly to the non-twisted case, we can deﬁne
f −1 :
Mod τ(CY ) →Mod f ∗τ(CX),
f∗, f! : Mod f ∗τ(CX) →Mod τ(CY ).
(7.5.1)
They have right derived functors:
f −1 : Db
τ(CY ) →Db
f ∗τ(CX),
Rf∗, Rf! : Db
f ∗τ(CX) →Db
τ(CY ).
(7.5.2)
The functor Rf! has a right adjoint functor
f ! : Db
τ(CY ) →Db
f ∗τ(CX).
(7.5.3)
7.6 Twisted Modules
Let τ = (X0
π−→X, L, m) be a twisting data on X. Let A be a sheaf of
C-algebras on X. Then we can deﬁne the category Mod τ(A ) of τ-twisted A -
modules. A τ-twisted A -module is a pair (F, β) of a π−1A -module F on X0
and a p−1A -linear isomorphism β : L ⊗p−1
2 F ∼
−−→p−1
1 F satisfying the chain
condition (7.2.1). Here p: X1 →X is the projection. The stack Modτ(A ) of
τ-twisted A -modules is locally equivalent to the stack Mod(A ) of A -modules.
7.7 Equivariant Twisting Data
Let G be a Lie group, and let X be a topological G-manifold. A G-equivariant
twisting data on X is a twisting data τ = (X0
π−→X, L, m) such that X0 is
a G-manifold, π is G-equivariant and L is G-equivariant, as well as m. Let
µ: G×X →X be the multiplication map and pr: G×X →X the projection.
Then the two twisting data µ∗τ and pr∗τ on G×X are canonically isomorphic.
We can then deﬁne the G-equivariant derived category Db
G,τ(CX), similarly
to the non-twisted case.
If G acts freely on X, then denoting by p: X →X/G the projection, we
can construct the quotient twisting data τ/G on X/G such that τ ∼= p∗(τ/G),
and we have an equivalence
Db
G,τ(CX) ≃Db
τ/G(CX/G).

7.8 Character Local System
In order to construct twisting data, the following notion is sometimes useful.
Let H be a real Lie group. Let µ: H × H →H be the multiplication
map and qj : H × H →H be the j-th projection (j = 1, 2). A character
local system on H is by deﬁnition an invertible CH-module L equipped with
an isomorphism m: q−1
1 L ⊗q−1
2 L ∼
−−→µ−1L satisfying the associativity law:
denoting by m(h1, h2): Lh1 ⊗Lh2 →Lh1h2 the morphism given by m, the
following diagram commutes for h1, h2, h3 ∈H
Lh1 ⊗Lh2 ⊗Lh3
m(h1,h2)

m(h2,h3)

Lh1h2 ⊗Lh3
m(h1h2,h3)

Lh1 ⊗Lh2h3
m(h1,h2h3)
 Lh1h2h3.
(7.8.1)
Let h be the Lie algebra of H. For A ∈h, let LH(A) and RH(A) denote
the vector ﬁelds on H deﬁned by

LH(A)f
	
(h) = d
dtf(e−tAh)

t=0 and

RH(A)f
	
(h) = d
dtf(hetA)

t=0 .
(7.8.2)
Let us take an H-invariant element λ of HomR(h, C) ≃HomC(C ⊗R h, C).
Hence λ satisﬁes λ([h, h]) = 0. Let Lλ be the sheaf of functions f on H
satisfying RH(A)f = λ(A)f for all A ∈h, or equivalently LH(A)f = −λ(A)f
for all A ∈h. Then Lλ is a local system on H of rank one. Regarding q−1
1 Lλ,
q−1
2 Lλ and µ−1Lλ as subsheaves of the sheaf OH×H of functions on H×H, the
multiplication morphism OH×H ⊗OH×H →OH×H induces an isomorphism
m: q−1
1 Lλ ⊗q−1
2 Lλ ∼
−−→µ−1Lλ.
(7.8.3)
With this data, Lλ has a structure of a character local system.
If λ lifts to a character χ: H →C∗, then Lλ is isomorphic to the trivial
character local system CH = L0 by CH ∼
−−→Lλ ⊂OH given by χ.
For λ, λ′ ∈HomH(h, C), we have
Lλ ⊗Lλ′ ∼= Lλ+λ′
(7.8.4)
compatible with m.
7.9 Twisted Equivariance
Let H, λ, Lλ be as in the preceding subsection. Let X be an H-manifold. Let
pr: H × X →X and q: H × X →H be the projections and µ: H × X →X
the multiplication map.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
203
Deﬁnition 7.9.1. An (H, λ)-equivariant sheaf on X is a pair (F, β) where F
is a CX-module and β is an isomorphism
β : q−1Lλ ⊗pr−1F ∼
−−→µ−1F
(7.9.1)
satisfying the following associativity law: letting β(h, x): (Lλ)h ⊗Fx ∼
−−→Fhx
be the induced morphism for (h, x) ∈H ×X, the following diagram commutes
for (h1, h2, x) ∈H × H × X:

Let us denote by Mod (H,λ)(CX) the category of (H, λ)-equivariant sheaves on
X. It is an abelian category.
If λ = 0, then Mod (H,λ)(CX) ≃Mod H(CX).
For x ∈X and h ∈H, we have a chain of isomorphisms
Fx ∼
←−−
β (Lλ)h−1 ⊗Fhx ∼
−−→C ⊗Fhx ≃Fhx.
(7.9.2)
Here (Lλ)h−1 ∼
−−→C is induced by the evaluation map (OH)h−1 →C. Let Hx
be the isotropy subgroup at x ∈X and hx its Lie algebra. Then, (7.9.2) gives
a group homomorphism
Hx →Aut(Fx).
Its inﬁnitesimal representation coincides with hx
−λ
−−→C →EndC(Fx).
Lemma 7.9.2 ([15]). Let X be a homogeneous space of H and x ∈X. Then
Mod (H,λ)(CX) is equivalent to the category of Hx-modules M such that its
inﬁnitesimal representation coincides with hx
−λ
−−→C →EndC(M).
7.10 Twisting Data Associated with Principal Bundles
Let π: X0 →X be a principal bundle with a real Lie group H as a structure
group. We use the convention that H acts from the left on X0. Let h be the
Lie algebra of H and λ an H-invariant element of HomR(h, C). Let Lλ be the
corresponding character local character system. Let us identify X0×X X0 with
H ×X0 by the isomorphism H ×X0 ∼
−−→X0×X X0 given by (h, x′) →(hx′, x′).
Then the projection map H×X0 →H gives q: X0×XX0 →H((hx′, x′) →h),
and the multiplication isomorphism (7.8.3) induces

M. Kashiwara
p−1
12 (q−1Lλ) ⊗p−1
23 (q−1Lλ) ∼
−−→p−1
13 (q−1Lλ).
Thus (X0 →X, q−1Lλ) is a twisting data on X. We denote it by τλ. By the
deﬁnition, we have an equivalence of categories:
Mod τλ(CX) ∼= Mod (H,λ)(CX0).
(7.10.1)
For λ, λ′ ∈HomH(h, C), we have
τλ ⊗τλ′ ∼= τλ+λ′.
Assume that X, X0 are complex manifolds, X0 →X and H are complex
analytic and λ is an H-invariant element of HomC(h, C). Let OX(λ) be the
sheaf on X0 given by
OX(λ) = {ϕ ∈OX0 ; LX(A)ϕ = −λ(A)ϕ
for any A ∈h}.
(7.10.2)
Then OX(λ) is (H, λ)-equivariant and we regard it as an object of Modτλ(OX).
7.11 Twisting (D-module Case)
So far, we discussed the twisting in the topological framework. Now let us
investigate the twisting in the D-module framework. This is similar to the
topological case. Referring the reader to [15] for treatments in a more general
situation, we restrict ourselves to the twisting arising from a principal bundle
as in § 7.10.
Let H be a complex aﬃne algebraic group, h its Lie algebra and let
RH, LH : h →ΘH be the Lie algebra homomorphisms deﬁned by (7.8.2).
For λ ∈HomH(h, C), let us deﬁne the DH-module Lλ = DHuλ by the
deﬁning relation RH(A)uλ = λ(A)uλ for any A ∈h (which is equivalent
to the relation: LH(A)uλ = −λ(A)uλ for any A ∈h). Hence we have
Lλ ∼= HomDH(Lλ, OHan). Let µ: H × H →H be the multiplication mor-
phism. Then we have DH×H-linear isomorphism
m: Lλ
D
⊠Lλ ∼
−−→Dµ∗Lλ
(7.11.1)
by m

uλ ⊠uλ) = µ∗(uλ). It satisﬁes the associative law similar to (7.8.1)
(i.e., (7.11.2) with M = Lλ and β = m). For λ, λ′ ∈HomH(h, C), there is an
isomorphism
Lλ
D⊗Lλ′ ∼= Lλ+λ′
that is compatible with m.
Let X be a complex algebraic H-manifold. Then we can deﬁne the notion
of (H, λ)-equivariant DX-module as in §7.9. Let us denote by µ: H × X →X
the multiplication morphism.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
205
Deﬁnition 7.11.1. An (H, λ)-equivariant DX-module is a pair (M , β) where
M is a DX-module and β is a DH×X-linear isomorphism
β : Lλ
D
⊠M ∼

(7.11.2)
Then the quasi-coherent (H, λ)-equivariant DX-modules form an abelian cat-
egory. We denote it by Mod (H,λ)(DX).
Note that any (H, λ)-equivariant DX-module may be regarded as a quasi-
H-equivariant DX-module since Lλ = OHuλ ∼= OH as an OH-module, and
m(uλ ⊠uλ) = µ∗uλ. Thus we have a fully faithful exact functor
Mod (H,λ)(DX) →Mod(DX, H).
Similarly to Lemma 3.1.4, we can prove the following lemma (see [15]).
Lemma 7.11.2. An object M of Mod(DX, H) is isomorphic to the image of
an object of Mod (H,λ)(DX) if and only if γM : h →EndDX(M ) coincides with
the composition h
λ−→C →EndDX(M ).
Note that for λ, λ′ ∈HomH(h, C), Lλ⊗Lλ′ ∼= Lλ+λ′ gives the right exact
functor
•
D⊗• =
• ⊗
OX
• : Mod (H,λ)(DX) × Mod (H,λ′)(DX) →Mod (H, λ+λ′)(DX).
Note that for M ∈Mod (H,λ)(DX), the sheaf HomDX(M , OXan) is an
(Han, λ)-equivariant sheaf on Xan.
7.12 Ring of Twisted Diﬀerential Operators
Let π: X0 →X be a principal H-bundle over X, and λ ∈HomH(h, C). Let
Nλ = DX0vλ be the DX0-module deﬁned by the deﬁning relation LX0(A)vλ =

206
M. Kashiwara
−λ(A)vλ. Then Nλ is an (H, λ)-equivariant DX0-module in an evident way.
We set
DX,λ =
(
f ∈π∗E ndDX0 (Nλ) ; f is H-equivariant
)op .
Here op means the opposite ring. Then DX,λ is a ring on X, and Nλ is a right
π−1DX,λ-module.
If there is a section s of π: X0 →X, then the composition DX,λ →
E ndDop
X (s∗Nλ) = E ndDop
X (DX) = DX is an isomorphism. Hence DX,λ is
locally isomorphic to DX (with respect to the ´etale topology), and hence it is
a ring of twisted diﬀerential operators on X (cf. e.g. [15]). We have
Lemma 7.12.1. We have an equivalence Mod (H,λ)(DX0) ∼= Mod(DX,λ). The
equivalence is given by:
Mod (H,λ)(DX0) ∋
&
M →π∗Hom(DX0,H)(Nλ, &
M ) ∈Mod(DX,λ)
and
Mod(DX,λ) ∋M →Nλ ⊗DX,λ M ∈Mod (H,λ)(DX0).
Here π∗Hom(DX0,H)(Nλ, &
M ) is the sheaf which associates
HomMod (H,λ)(Dπ−1U)(Nλ|π−1U, &
M |π−1U)
to an open set U of X.
Note that OXan(λ) ∼= HomDX0 (Nλ, OXan
0 ) is an (Han, λ)-equivariant sheaf
and it may be regarded as a τλ-twisted DXan,λ-module:
OXan(λ) ∈Mod τλ(DXan,λ).
The twisted module OXan(λ) plays the role of OXan for DX-modules. For
example, deﬁning by
DRX(M ) := RH om DXan,λ(OXan(λ), M an)
and
SolX(M ) := RH om DX,λ(M , OXan(λ)),
we obtain the functors
DRX : Db(DX,λ) →Db
τ−λ(CXan),
SolX : Db(DX,λ)op →Db
τλ(CXan).
(7.12.1)
Note that we have
Mod(DXan,λ) ≃Mod τ−λ(DXan)
by M →OXan(−λ) ⊗M .

7.13 Equivariance of Twisted Sheaves and Twisted D-modules
Let π: X0 →X be a principal bundle with an aﬃne group H as a structure
group, and let λ ∈HomH(h, C). Assume that an aﬃne group G acts on X0 and
X such that π is G-equivariant and the action of G commutes with the action
of H. Then, as we saw in §7.6, we can deﬁne the notion of Gan-equivariant τλ-
twisted CXan-modules, and the equivariant derived category Db
Gan,τλ(CXan).
Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Then, for any A ∈g, Nλ ∋vλ →LX0(A)vλ ∈
Nλ extends to a DX0-linear endomorphism of Nλ and it gives an element of
DX,λ. Hence we obtain a Lie algebra homomorphism
g →Γ(X; DX,λ).
We can deﬁne the notion of quasi-G-equivariant DX,λ-modules and G-
equivariant DX,λ-modules. Moreover the results in the preceding sections for
non-twisted case hold with a suitable modiﬁcation, and we shall not repeat
them. For example, for λ, µ ∈HomH(h, C), we have a functor
•
D⊗• : Db(DX,λ, G) × Db(DX,µ, G) →Db(DX,λ+µ, G).
If GR is a real Lie group with a Lie group morphism GR →Gan,
RHomtop
DX,λ(M ⊗F, OXan(λ)) ∈Db(FNGR)
is well-deﬁned for M ∈Db
cc(DX,λ, G) and F ∈Db
GR,τλ,ctb(CXan). Note that
HomC(F, OXan(λ)) ∈Mod(DXan,λ) because OXan(λ) ∈Mod τλ(DXan,λ).
7.14 Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence
Let π: X0 →X, H, G and λ ∈HomH(h, C) be as in the preceding subsection.
Assume that λ vanishes on the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of H. Then
Lλ is a regular holonomic DH-module. Hence we can deﬁne the notion of
regular holonomic DX,λ-module (i.e. a DX,λ-module M is regular holonomic
if Nλ ⊗DX,λ M is a regular holonomic DX0-module).
Assume that there are ﬁnitely many G-orbits in X. Then any coherent
holonomic G-equivariant DX,λ-module is regular holonomic (see [15]). Hence
the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (see Subsection 4.6) implies the following
result.
Theorem 7.14.1. Assume that λ vanishes on the Lie algebra of the unipotent
radical of H. If there are only ﬁnitely many G-orbits in X, then the functor
DRX := RH om DXan,λ(OXan(λ),

G,coh(DX,λ) →Db
Gan,τ−λ, C-c(CXan)
is an equivalence of triangulated categories.

For F ∈Db(CX×Y ) and G ∈Db(CY ×Z), we deﬁne the object F ◦G of
Db(CX×Z) by
F ◦G := Rp13!(p12
−1F ⊗p23
−1G).
(8.1.1)
We call it the convolution of F and G.
Hence we obtain the functor
• ◦• : Db(CX×Y ) × Db(CY ×Z) −→Db(CX×Z).
In particular, letting X or Z be {pt}, we obtain
• ◦• : Db(CY ) × Db(CY ×Z) −→Db(CZ)
Db(CX×Y ) × Db(CY ) −→Db(CX).
This functor satisﬁes the associative law
(F ◦G) ◦H ≃F ◦(G ◦H)
for F ∈Db(CX×Y ), G ∈Db(CY ×Z) and H ∈Db(CZ×W ).
This can be generalized to the twisted case. Let τX (resp. τY , τZ) be a
twisting data on X (resp. Y , Z). Then we have a functor
• ◦• : Db
τX⊠(τY )⊗−1(CX×Y )×Db
τY ⊠(τZ)⊗−1(CY ×Z) −→Db
τX⊠(τZ)⊗−1(CX×Z).
Similarly, we can deﬁne the convolutions of D-modules. Let X, Y and Z
be algebraic manifolds. Then we can deﬁne, for M ∈Db(DX×Y ) and N ∈
Db(DY ×Z), the object M
D◦N of Db(DX×Z) by
M
D◦N := Dp13∗(Dp12
∗M
D⊗Dp23
∗N ).
(8.1.2)
We call it the convolution of M and N .
Hence we obtain the functor
•
D◦
• : Db(DX×Y ) × Db(DY ×Z) −→Db(DX×Z).
If X, Y and Z are quasi-projective G-manifolds, we can deﬁne
•
D◦
• : Db(DX×Y , G) × Db(DY ×Z, G) −→Db(DX×Z, G).
These deﬁnitions also extend to the twisted case.

If we assume the non-characteristic condition:


Theorem 5.7.2 implies that

(8.2.2)
Here, K:=DRX×Y (K ) ∈Db

we have
RHomtop
DX×Y (Dp1

Combining this with (8.2.1) and (8.2.2), we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 8.2.1 (Integral transform formula). Let G be an aﬃne alge-
braic group, and let GR be a Lie group with a Lie group morphism GR →Gan.

(8.2.4)
Remark 8.2.2. If G acts transitively on X, then the non-characteristic condi-
tion (8.2.3) is always satisﬁed. Indeed, let µX : T ∗X →g∗, µY : T ∗Y →g∗and
µX×Y : T ∗(X × Y ) →g∗be the moment maps. Then we have µX×Y (ξ, η) =
µX(ξ) + µY (η) for ξ ∈T ∗X and η ∈T ∗Y . Since K ∈Db
G,hol(DX), we have
Ch(K ) ⊂µ−1

Remark 8.2.3. Although we don’t repeat here, there is a twisted version of
Theorem 8.2.1.
9 Application to the Representation Theory
9.1 Notations
In this section, we shall apply the machinery developed in the earlier sections
to the representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups.
Let GR be a connected real semisimple Lie group with a ﬁnite center,
and let KR be a maximal compact subgroup of GR. Let gR and kR be the Lie
algebra of GR and KR, respectively. Let g and k be their complexiﬁcations. Let
K be the complexiﬁcation of KR. Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic
group with the Lie algebra g, and assume that there is an injective morphism
GR →Gan of real Lie groups which induces the embedding gR  →g.4
Thus we obtain the diagrams:
KR  

 	

K 	

GR  
 G
and
kR  

 	

k 	

gR  
 g.
Let us take an Iwasawa decomposition
GR = KR AR NR,
gR = kR ⊕aR ⊕nR.
(9.1.1)
Let a, n be the complexiﬁcation of aR and nR. Let A and N be the connected
closed subgroups of G with Lie algebras a and n, respectively.
4 In this note, we assume that GR →G is injective. However, we can remove this
condition, by regarding G/K as an orbifold.

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
211
Let MR = ZKR(aR) and mR = ZkR(aR). Let M and m be the complexiﬁ-
cation of MR and mR. Then we have M = ZK(A). Let P be the parabolic
subgroup of G with m ⊕a ⊕n as its Lie algebra, and PR = MRARNR ⊂GR.
Let us ﬁx a Cartan subalgebra t of g such that
t = C ⊗R tR
where
tR = (t ∩mR) ⊕aR.
(9.1.2)
Let T be the maximal torus of G with t as its Lie algebra.
We take a Borel subalgebra b of g containing t and n, and let B be the
Borel subgroup with b as its Lie algebra.
We have
K ∩P = M
and
K ∩B = M ∩B,
K ∩T = M ∩T,
and M/(M ∩B) ≃P/B is the ﬂag manifold for M.
Let ∆be the root system of (g, t), and take the positive root system
∆+ = {α ∈∆; gα ⊂b}. Let ∆k = {α ∈∆; gα ⊂k} = {α ∈∆; gα ⊂m} =
{α ∈∆; α|a = 0} be the set of compact roots, and set ∆+
k = ∆k ∩∆+. Let ρ
be the half sum of positive roots.
An element λ of t∗is called integral if it can be lifted to a character of T.
We say that λ|k∩t is integral if it can be lifted to a character of K ∩T = M ∩T.
Let z(g) denote the center of the universal enveloping algebra U(g) of g.
Let χ: z(g) →C[t∗] = S(t) be the ring morphism given by:
a −(χ(a))(λ) ∈Ker(b
λ−→C)U(g)
for any λ ∈t∗and a ∈z(g).
It means that a ∈z(g) acts on the lowest weight module with lowest weight
λ through the multiplication by the scalar (χ(a))(λ). For λ ∈t∗, let
χλ : z(g) →C
be the ring homomorphism given by χλ(a) := (χ(a))(λ). Note that
for λ, µ ∈t∗, χλ = χµ if and only if w ◦λ = µ for some w ∈W.
(9.1.3)
Here w ◦λ = w(λ −ρ) + ρ is the shifted action of the Weyl group W. We set
Uλ(g) = U(g)/

U(g) Ker(χλ)
	
.
Then Uλ(g)-modules are nothing but g-modules with inﬁnitesimal character
χλ.
Let X be the ﬂag manifold of G (the set of Borel subgroups of G).
Then X is a projective G-manifold and X ≃G/B. For x ∈X, we set
B(x) = {g ∈G ; gx = x}, b(x) = Lie(B(x)) the Lie algebra of B(x), and
n(x) = [b(x), b(x)] the nilpotent radical of b(x). Let x0 ∈X be the point of X
such that b(x0) = b. Then, for any x ∈X, there exists a unique Lie algebra
homomorphism b(x) →t which is equal to the composition b(x)
Ad(g)
−−−−→b →t
for any g ∈G such that gx = x0.

212
M. Kashiwara
Let Xmin = G/P. Let
π: X →Xmin
be the canonical projection. We set xmin
0
= π(x0) = e mod P.
Let ˜p: G →X be the G-equivariant projection such that ˜p(e) = x0. Then
this is a principal B-bundle. For λ ∈t∗= (b/n)∗= HomB(b, C), let DX,λ be
the ring of twisted diﬀerential operators on X with twist λ. Let τλ denote the
Gan-equivariant twisting data on Xan corresponding to λ (see §7.10, 7.12).
Note the following lemma (see [15] and Lemma 7.9.2).
Lemma 9.1.1.
(i) Let H be a closed algebraic subgroup of G with a Lie
algebra h ⊂g, Z an H-orbit in X and x ∈Z. Then the category
Mod H(DZ,λ) of H-equivariant DZ,λ-modules is equivalent to the category
of H ∩B(x)-modules V whose inﬁnitesimal representation coincides with
h ∩b(x) →b(x) →t
λ
−→C →EndC(V ).
(ii) Let H be a closed real Lie subgroup of Gan with a Lie algebra h ⊂g,
Z an H-orbit in Xan and x ∈Z. Then the category Mod H,τλ(CZ) of
H-equivariant τλ-twisted sheaves on Z is equivalent to the category of
H ∩B(x)-modules V whose inﬁnitesimal representation coincides with
h ∩b(x) →b(x) →t
−λ
−−→C →EndC(V ).
Note that, in the situation of (i), the de Rham functor gives an equivalence
Mod H(DZ,λ) ∼
−−→Mod Han,τ−λ(CZan).
9.2 Beilinson-Bernstein Correspondence
Let us recall a result of Beilinson-Bernstein [1] on the correspondence of U(g)-
modules and D-modules on the ﬂag manifold.
For α ∈∆, let α∨∈t be the corresponding co-root.
Deﬁnition 9.2.1. Let λ ∈t∗.
(i) We say that λ is regular if ⟨α∨, λ⟩does not vanish for any α ∈∆+.
(ii) We say that a weight λ ∈t∗is integrally anti-dominant if ⟨α∨, λ⟩̸=
1, 2, 3, . . . for any α ∈∆+.
Recall that ˜p: G →X = G/B is the projection. For λ ∈t∗= HomB(b, C), we
have deﬁned the twisting data τλ on Xan and the ring of twisted diﬀerential
operators DX,λ. We deﬁned also OXan(λ). Recall that OXan(λ) is a twisted
DXan,λ-module, and it is an object of Mod τλ(DXan,λ).
If λ is an integral weight, then the twisting data τλ is trivial and OXan(λ) is
the invertible OXan-module associated with the invertible OX-module OX(λ):
OX(λ) =
(
u ∈˜p∗OG ; u(gb−1) = bλu(g) for any b ∈B
)
.
(9.2.1)
Here B ∋b →bλ ∈C∗is the character of B corresponding to λ ∈HomB(b, C).
Note that we have

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
213
DX,λ+µ = OX(µ) ⊗DX,λ ⊗OX(−µ)
for any λ ∈t and any integral µ ∈t.
(9.2.2)
If λ is an anti-dominant integral weight (i.e., ⟨α∨, λ⟩∈Z⩽0 for any α ∈
∆+), let V (λ) be the irreducible G-module with lowest weight λ. Then we
have
Γ(X; OX(λ)) ≃V (λ).
(9.2.3)
Here the isomorphism V (λ) ∼
−−→Γ(X; OX(λ)) is given as follows. Let us ﬁx a
highest weight vector u−λ of V (−λ) = V (λ)∗. Then, for any v ∈V (λ), the
function ⟨v, gu−λ⟩in g ∈G is the corresponding global section of OX(λ).
The following theorem is due to Beilinson-Bernstein ([1]).
Theorem 9.2.2. Let λ be an element of t∗∼= HomB(b, C).
(i) We have
Hk(X; DX,λ) ≃
*
Uλ(g)
for k = 0,
0
otherwise.
(ii) Assume that λ −ρ is integrally anti-dominant. Then we have
(a) for any quasi-coherent DX,λ-module M , we have
Hn(X; M ) = 0
for any n ̸= 0,
(b) for any Uλ(g)-module M, we have an isomorphism
M ∼
−−→Γ(X; DX,λ ⊗U(g) M),
namely, the diagram

DX,λ⊗U(g) •

Mod(DX,λ)
Γ(X; • )

Mod(Uλ(g))
(9.2.4)
quasi-commutes.
(iii) Assume that λ −ρ is regular and integrally anti-dominant. Then
M ≃DX,λ ⊗U(g) Γ(X; M ),
and we have an equivalence of categories
Mod(Uλ(g)) ≃Mod(DX,λ).

9.3 Quasi-equivariant D-modules on the Symmetric Space
We set S = G/K. Let j : pt  →S be the morphism given by the origin s0 ∈
S. By Proposition 3.1.5, j∗: Mod(DS, G) ∼
−−→Mod(g, K) is an equivalence of
categories. Since Db(DS, G) = Db(Mod(DS, G)) by the deﬁnition, j∗induces
an equivalence
Lj∗: Db(DS, G) ∼
−−→Db(Mod(g, K)).
(9.3.1)
Let
Ψ : Db(Mod(g, K)) ∼
−−→Db(DS, G)
be its quasi-inverse.
Consider the diagram:

It is an object of Mod coh(DX,−λ, G).
For L ∈Db
K, coh(DX,λ), set L0 = IndG
K(L ) ∈Db
G,coh(DX×S,λ). Let us
calculate M0
D◦L0 ∈Db
coh(DS, G).
We have
M0
D◦L0 = Dp2∗(Dp∗

≃Rp2∗(DS←−X×S

On the other hand, we have

L⊗OX×SL0)
≃ΩX
L⊗DX(p∗

Let ˜j : X →X ×S be the induced morphism (x →(x, s0)). Then, we have
Lj∗Rp2∗L0 ≃R Γ(X; D˜j∗L0) ≃R Γ(X; L ).
Thus we obtain the following proposition.

Proof.
We know that Hn(M

K L ) ≃Ψ(M) for some M ∈

resolution whose components are of the form DX,−λ ⊗(Ω⊗−1
X

for an integrable µ ∈t∗and a ﬁnite-dimensional G-module V , we may assume
from the beginning that M = DX,−λ ⊗

9.4 Matsuki Correspondence
The following theorem is due to Matsuki ([22]).
Theorem 9.4.1.
(i) There are only ﬁnitely many K-orbits in X and also
ﬁnitely many GR-orbits in Xan.
(ii) There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of K-orbits in X
and the one of GR-orbits.
More precisely, a K-orbit E and a GR-orbit F correspond by the correspon-
dence above if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisﬁed:
(1) Ean ∩F is a KR-orbit,
(2) Ean ∩F is non-empty and compact.
Its sheaf-theoretic version was conjectured by the author [14] and proved
by Mirkovi´c-Uzawa-Vilonen [23]. Let SR = GR/KR be the Riemannian sym-
metric space and set S = G/K. Then S is an aﬃne algebraic manifold. The
canonical map i: SR  →San is a closed embedding.
We have the functor
IndGan
Kan : Db
Kan,τλ(CXan) →Db
Gan,τλ(C(X×S)an).
(9.4.1)
We deﬁne the functor
Φ: Db
Kan,τλ(CXan) →Db
GR,τλ(CXan)
by
Φ(F) = IndGan
Kan(F) ◦i∗i!CSan[2dS]
= R(pan
1 )!(IndGan
Kan(F) ⊗(pan
2 )−1i∗i!CSan)[2dS].
Here, pan
1
and pan
2
are the projections from Xan × San to Xan and San, re-
spectively. Note that i∗i!CSan is isomorphic to i∗CSR[−dS] (once we give an
orientation of SR). Hence we have
Φ(F) ≃Rp1R!(IndGan
Kan(F)|X×SR)[dS] ≃Rp1R!(IndGR
KR(F))[dS],
(9.4.2)
where p1R : Xan × SR →Xan is the projection.
Theorem 9.4.2 ([23]). The functor Φ induces equivalences of triangulated
categories:

Db
Kan,τλ,C-c(CXan) ∼

GR,τλ,R-c(CXan) .

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
217
We call Φ the Matsuki correspondence.
For some equivariant sheaves, the Matsuki correspondence is given as fol-
lows.
Proposition 9.4.3 ([23]). Let iZ : Z  →X be a K-orbit in X and let
iZa : Za  →Xan be the GR-orbit corresponding to Z.
(i) The restriction functors induce equivalences of categories:
Mod Kan,τλ(CZan) ∼
−−→Mod KR,τλ(CZan∩Za) ∼
←−−Mod GR,τλ(CZa).
(ii) Assume that F ∈Mod Kan,τλ(CZan) and F a ∈Mod GR,τλ(CZa) corre-
spond by the equivalence above. Then we have
Φ(R(ian
Z )∗F) ≃R(iZa)!F a[2 codimX Z].
The K-orbit Kx0 ⊂X is a unique open K-orbit in X and GRx0 ⊂Xan is
a unique closed GR-orbit in Xan. Set XR
min = GR/PR. Then XR
min = GRxmin
0
=
KRxmin
0
and it is a unique closed GR-orbit in Xan
min. We have
(Kx0)an = (π−1(Kxmin
0
))an ⊃GRx0 = KRx0 = (πan)−1(XR
min).
(9.4.3)
Let j : Kx0  →X be the open embedding and ja : GRx0  →Xan the
closed embedding. Then as a particular case of Proposition 9.4.3, we have an
isomorphism:
Φ(Rjan
∗F) ≃ja
∗(F|GRx0)
(9.4.4)
for any Kan-equivariant local system F on Kanx0.
9.5 Construction of Representations
For M ∈Mod f(g, K), let Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) be the set of homomor-
phisms from M to C∞(GR) which commute with the actions of g and KR.
Here, g and KR act on C∞(GR) through the right GR-action on GR. Then GR
acts on Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) through the left GR-action on GR.
Let us write by C∞(GR)KR-ﬁni the set of KR-ﬁnite vectors of C∞(GR).
Then C∞(GR)KR-ﬁni is a (g, K)-module and
Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ≃Hom(g,K)(M, C∞(GR)KR-ﬁni).
Note that, in our context, KR is connected and hence the g-invariance implies
the KR-invariance. Therefore, we have
Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ≃Homg(M, C∞(GR)) .
We endow Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) with the Fr´echet nuclear topology as in
Lemma 5.3.1.

218
M. Kashiwara
In any way, Hom(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) has a Fr´echet nuclear GR-module
structure. We denote it by Homtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)). Let us denote by
RHomtop
(g,KR)( • , C∞(GR)) : Db(Mod f(g, K)) →Db(FNGR)
its right derived functor.5 Note that Mod f(g, K) has enough projectives,
and any M can be represented by a complex P of projective objects in
Mod f(g, K), and then RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) is represented by a complex
Homtop
(g,KR)(P, C∞(GR)) of Fr´echet nuclear GR-modules. Note that for a ﬁnite-
dimensional K-module V , U(g) ⊗k V is a projective object of Mod f(g, K),
and Homtop
(g,KR)(U(g) ⊗k V, C∞(GR)) ≃HomKR(V, C∞(GR)).
Since we have Homtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ≃Homtop
DS (Ψ(M), C ∞
SR ) for any M ∈
Mod f(g, K), their right derived functors are isomorphic:
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ≃RHomtop
DS(Ψ(M), C ∞
SR )
for any M ∈Db(Mod f(g, K)).
Lemma 9.5.1. Let M be a Harish-Chandra module. Then Ψ(M) is an elliptic
DS-module.
Proof.
Let ∆be a Casimir element of U(g). Then there exists a non-
zero polynomial a(t) such that a(∆)M = 0. Hence the characteristic variety
Ch(Ψ(M)) ⊂T ∗S of Ψ(M) is contained in the zero locus of the principal
symbol of LS(∆). Then the result follows from the well-known fact that the
Laplacian LS(∆)|SR is an elliptic diﬀerential operator on SR.
Q.E.D.
If the cohomologies of M ∈Db(Mod f(g, K)) are Harish-Chandra modules,
then Ψ(M) is elliptic, and Proposition 6.3.3 implies
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ∼
−−→RHomtop
DS(Ψ(M) ⊗i∗i!CSan, OSan).
(9.5.1)
There is a dual notion. For M ∈Mod f(g, K), let Γc(GR; DistGR)⊗(g,KR)M
be the quotient of Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗C M by the linear subspace spanned by
vectors (RGR(A)u)⊗v+u⊗(Av) and (ku)⊗(kv)−u⊗v (u ∈Γc(GR; DistGR),
v ∈M, A ∈g, k ∈KR). Here, we consider it as a vector space (not consid-
ering the topology). In our case, KR is connected, and KR acts trivially on
Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗U(k) M. Therefore, we have
Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗(g,KR) M ≃Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗U(g) M.
It is a right exact functor from Mod f(g, K) to the category Mod(C) of
C-vector spaces. Let
5 We may write here Homtop
U(g)(M, C∞(GR)), but we use this notation in order to
emphasize that it is calculated not on Mod(U(g)) but on Mod f(g, K).

Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)

For any M ∈Db(Mod f(g, K)), we can take a quasi-isomorphism P
• →M
such that each P n has a form U(g) ⊗k V n for a ﬁnite-dimensional K-module
V n. Then, we have
Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗(g,KR) P n ≃Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗U(k) V n
≃(Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗C V n)KR ,
where the superscript KR means the set of KR-invariant vectors. The KR-
module structure on Γc(GR; DistGR) is by the right action of KR on GR. By
the left action of GR on GR, GR acts on Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗(g,KR) P n. Hence
it belongs to DFNGR. The object Γc(GR; DistGR) ⊗(g,KR) P
• ∈Db(DFNGR)
does not depend on the choice of a quasi-isomorphism P
• →M, and we
denote it by Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)M. Thus we have constructed a functor:
Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR) • : Db(Mod f(g, K)) →Db(DFNGR) .
(9.5.3)
If we forget the topology and the equivariance, (9.5.3) reduces to (9.5.2).
We have

L⊗(g,KR)M ≃

In general, RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) and Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)M are
not strict (see Theorems 10.4.1 and 10.4.2).
9.6 Integral Transformation Formula
Since X has ﬁnitely many K-orbits, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
(Theorem 7.14.1) implies the following theorem.

Recall that the de Rham functor is deﬁned by
DRX : M →RH om DXan,λ(OXan(λ), M an),
where M an = DXan,λ ⊗DX,λ M . Similarly to (9.4.1), we have the equivalence
of categories:

Let us take L ∈Db

Set L = DRX(L ) := RH om DXan,λ(OXan(λ), L an

and L0 = IndGan
Kan L = DRX×S(L0) ∈Db

coh(DX,−λ, G).
Then Theorem 8.2.1 (see Remark 8.2.2) immediately implies the following
result.
Proposition 9.6.2. For M ∈Db
coh(DX,−λ, G) and L ∈Db
K,coh(DX,λ) and
L = DRX(L ) ∈Db

(9.6.3)
in Db(FNGR).
Let us recall the equivalence Lj∗: Db
coh(DS, G) ∼
−−→Db(Mod f(g, K)) in
(9.3.1). Since Lj∗(M
D◦IndG
K(L )) has Harish-Chandra modules as cohomolo-
gies by Proposition 9.3.2, the isomorphism (9.5.1) reads as
RHomtop
DS(M

≃RHomtop
(g,KR)(Lj∗(M

(9.6.4)
in Db(FNGR). Thus we obtain the following proposition.

Now let us take as M the quasi-G-equivariant DX,−λ-module
M0 := DX,−λ ⊗Ω⊗−1

.
Then we have by Proposition 9.3.1
Lj∗(M0
D◦IndG
K(L )) ≃R Γ(X; L ).
On the other hand, we have
RHomtop
DX,−λ(M0 ⊗Φ(L), OXan(−λ))
≃RHomtop
C (Φ(L), ΩXan ⊗OXan OXan(−λ))
≃RHomtop
C (Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ)).
Here the last isomorphism follows from ΩX ≃OX(2ρ).
Thus we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 9.6.4. For L ∈Db
K(DX,λ), we have an isomorphism

Taking their dual, we obtain the following theorem.

10 Vanishing Theorems
10.1 Preliminary
In this section, let us show that, for any Harish-Chandra module M, the object
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) of Db(FNGR) is strict and
Extn
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) := Hn
RHomtop

for n ̸= 0.

222
M. Kashiwara
In order to prove this, we start by the calculation of the both sides of
(9.6.6) for a K-equivariant holonomic DX,λ-module L such that
L ∼
−−→j∗j∗L ,
(10.1.1)
where j : Kx0  →X is the open embedding of the open K-orbit Kx0 into X.
There exists a cartesian product
Kx0  
j


□
X
π

Kxmin

 
 Xmin.
Since Kxmin
0
∼= K/M is an aﬃne variety, Kxmin
0
→Xmin is an aﬃne mor-
phism, and hence j : Kx0  →X is an aﬃne morphism. Therefore
Dnj∗j∗M = 0
for n ̸= 0 and an arbitrary M ∈Mod(DX).
(10.1.2)
Hence by the hypothesis (10.1.1), we have
L ∼
−−→Dj∗j∗L .
(10.1.3)
Let V be the stalk L (x0) regarded as a (K ∩B)-module. Then its in-
ﬁnitesimal action coincides with k ∩b →b
λ−→C →EndC(V ) by Lemma
9.1.1.
Hence, if L ̸= 0, then we have
λ|t∩k is integral, in particular ⟨α∨, λ⟩∈Z for any α ∈∆+
k .
(10.1.4)
Recall that we say λ|t∩k is integral if λ|t∩k is the diﬀerential of a character of
K ∩T = M ∩T.
Conversely, for a (K ∩B)-module V whose inﬁnitesimal action coincides
with k ∩b →b
λ−→C →EndC(V ), there exists a K-equivariant DX,λ-module
L such that it satisﬁes (10.1.1) and L (x0) ≃V (see Lemma 9.1.1).
10.2 Calculation (I)
Let L be a K-equivariant coherent DX,λ-module satisfying (10.1.1).
Recall that π: X ≃G/B →Xmin = G/P is a canonical morphism. Let
s: X0 := π−1(xmin
0
) →X be the embedding. Then X0 ≃P/B ≃M/(M ∩B)
is the ﬂag manifold of M. Note that L |Kx0 is a locally free OKx0-module
(Kx0 = π−1(Kxmin
0
) is an open subset of X). Hence we have Ds∗L ≃s∗L .
Since X0 is the ﬂag manifold of M and s∗L is a DX0,λ-module, we have by
Theorem 9.2.2
Hn(X0; s∗L ) = 0
for n ̸= 0
(10.2.1)

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
223
under the condition:
λ|t∩k is integral and ⟨α∨, λ⟩∈Z⩽0 for α ∈∆+
k .
(10.2.2)
Hence Rnπ∗L

Kxmin
0
= 0 for n ̸= 0, and we have
Hn(X; L ) = Hn(Kx0; L ) = Hn(Kxmin
0
; π∗(L )).
(10.2.3)
Since Kxmin
0
∼= K/M is an aﬃne variety, we obtain
Hn(X; L ) = 0
for n ̸= 0
under the conditions (10.1.1) and (10.2.2).
(10.2.4)
Now let us calculate Γ(Kx0; L ). The sheaf L is a K-equivariant vector
bundle on Kx0. We have Kx0 = K/(K ∩B). Hence L is determined by the
isotropy representation of K ∩B on the stalk V := L (x0) of L at x0. We
have as a K-module
Γ(X; L ) = Γ(Kx0; L ) ∼= (OK(K) ⊗V )K∩B.
(10.2.5)
Here the action of K∩B on OK(K)⊗V is the diagonal action where the action
on OK(K) is through the right multiplication of K ∩B on K. The superscript
K ∩B means the space of (K ∩B)-invariant vectors. The K-module structure
on (OK(K) ⊗V )K∩B is through the left K-action on K.
Thus we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 10.2.1. Assume that λ satisﬁes (10.2.2) and a K-equivariant
holonomic DX,λ-module L satisﬁes (10.1.1), and set V = L (x0). Then we
have
Hn(X; L ) ∼=
*
(OK(K) ⊗V )K∩B
for n = 0,
0
for n ̸= 0
(10.2.6)
as a K-module.
For a (g, K)-module M, we shall calculate Hom(g,K)(M, Γ(X; L )). We
have the isomorphism HomK(M, Γ(X; L )) ∼
−−→HomK∩B(M, V ) by the evalu-
ation map ψ: Γ(X; L ) →L (x0) = V . Since L is a DX,λ-module, we have
ψ(At) = ⟨λ, A⟩ψ(t)
for any A ∈b and t ∈Γ(X; L ).
(10.2.7)
Indeed, LX(A) −⟨λ, A⟩∈mx0DX,λ for any A ∈b, where mx0 is the maximal
ideal of (OX)x0.
Lemma 10.2.2. For any (g, K)-module M, and L ∈Mod K(DX,λ) satisfying
(10.1.1), we have
Hom(g,K)(M, Γ(X; L ))
∼=
(
f ∈HomK∩B(M, L (x0)) ;
f(As) = ⟨λ, A⟩f(s) for any A ∈b and s ∈M
)
.
(10.2.8)

224
M. Kashiwara
Proof. Set V = L (x0).
For h ∈Hom(g,K)(M, Γ(X; L )), let f ∈HomK∩B(M, V ) be the element
ψ◦h. Since h is g-linear, (10.2.7) implies that f satisﬁes the condition: f(As) =
ψ(h(As)) = ψ(Ah(s)) = ⟨λ, A⟩ψ(h(s)) = ⟨λ, A⟩f(s) for any A ∈b and s ∈M.
Conversely, for f ∈HomK∩B(M, V ) such that f(As) = ⟨λ, A⟩f(s) for
A ∈b and s ∈M, let h ∈HomK(M, Γ(X; L )) be the corresponding element:
ψ(h(s)) = f(s).
Then, we obtain
h(As) = Ah(s)
at x = x0 for any A ∈g.
(10.2.9)
Indeed, we have g = k + b. The equation (10.2.9) holds for A ∈k by the
K-equivariance of h, and also for A ∈b because
f(As) = ⟨λ, A⟩f(s) = ⟨λ, A⟩ψ(h(s)) = ψ(Ah(s)).
Since h is K-equivariant, h(As) = Ah(s) holds at any point of Kx0. There-
fore we have h(As) = Ah(s).
Q.E.D.
10.3 Calculation (II)
Let L ∈Mod K, coh(DX,λ), and set L = DRX(L ) ∈Db
Kan,τ−λ(CXan). Now,
we shall calculate RHomtop
C (Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ))[dX], the right-hand side
of (9.6.6), under the conditions (10.1.1) and (10.2.2). We do it forgetting the
topology and the equivariance.
By the assumption (10.2.2), we can decompose λ = λ1 + λ0 where λ1
is integral and λ0|k∩t = 0. Then λ0 may be regarded as a P-invariant map
Lie(P) = m⊕a⊕n →C. Hence, we can consider the twisting data τλ0,Xan
min on
Xan
min. Then, the twisting data τλ0 on Xan is isomorphic to π∗τλ0,Xan
min. Since
the twisting data τλ1 is trivial, we have τλ ∼= π∗τλ0,Xan
min.
Since L ≃Dj∗j∗L , we have L ≃Rj∗j∗L. Hence, (9.4.4) implies that
Φ(L) = ja
∗(L|GRx0).
(10.3.1)
Here, ja : GRx0  →X is the closed embedding. We can regard L|GRx0 as a
GR-equivariant (π∗τ−λ0,Xan
min)-twisted local system
Then there exists a GR-equivariant τ−λ0,Xan
min-twisted local system L on
XR
min such that L|GRx0 ≃(πan)−1L, because the ﬁber of πan is simply con-
nected.
Hence, we have
RHom C (Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ)) [dX]

(πan)−1L, OXan(−λ + 2ρ)

[dX]
≃RHom C

L, R(πan)∗OXan(−λ + 2ρ)

[dX].

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
225
On the other hand, we have
R(πan)∗OXan(−λ + 2ρ) ≃OXan
min(−λ0) ⊗R(πan)∗OXan(−λ1 + 2ρ),
and we have, by the Serre-Grothendieck duality,
Rπ∗OX(−λ1 + 2ρ)[dX] ≃Rπ∗RH om OX(OX(λ1), ΩX)[dX]
≃RH om OXmin (Rπ∗OX(λ1), ΩXmin)[dXmin].
Since λ1|k∩t = λ|k∩t is anti-dominant, Rπ∗OX(λ1) is concentrated at degree
0 by Theorem 9.2.2 (ii), and V = π∗OX(λ1) is the G-equivariant locally free
OXmin-module associated with the representation
P →MA →Aut(Vλ1),
where Vλ1 is the irreducible (MA)-module with lowest weight λ1 (see (9.2.3)).
Thus we obtain
RHom C(Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ))[dX]
≃RHom OXmin(Rπ∗OX(λ1) ⊗OXan
min(λ0) ⊗L, ΩXan
min)[dXmin]
≃RHom OXan
min(Van ⊗OXan
min(λ0) ⊗L, ΩXan

On the other hand, since L is supported on XR
min,
RH om C(L, OXan
min) [dXmin] ≃RH om C(L, R ΓXR
min(OXan
min))[dXmin]
≃RH om C(L, BXR
min ⊗or XR
min).
Here, or XR
min is the orientation sheaf of XR
min, and BXR
min
= or XR
min ⊗
RH om C(CXR
min, OXan
min)[dXmin] is the sheaf of hyperfunctions. Thus we ob-
tain
RHom C

[dX]
≃RHom OXmin (V ⊗Ω⊗−1
Xmin ⊗OXan
min(λ0) ⊗L ⊗or XR
min, BXR
min).
Note that OXan
min(λ0) is a τλ0,Xan
min-twisted sheaf and L is a τ−λ0,Xan
min-twisted
sheaf. Hence OXan
min(λ0)⊗L is a (non-twisted) locally free OXan
min|XR
min-module.
Hence, so is Van ⊗Ω⊗−1
Xmin ⊗OXan
min(λ0) ⊗L ⊗or XR
min. Since BXR
min is a ﬂabby

Hn
RHom OXan

= 0 for n ̸= 0.
Hence, we obtain
Hn
RHom C(Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ)[dX])
	
= 0 for n ̸= 0.

M. Kashiwara
Proposition 10.3.1. Assume that λ ∈t∗satisﬁes (10.2.2), and let L be a
K-equivariant DX,λ-module satisfying (10.1.1). Then we have
(i) RHomtop
(g,KR)(Γ(X; L ), C∞(GR)) ∈Db(FNGR) is strict, and
(ii) Hn
RHomtop
(g,KR)(Γ(X; L ), C∞(GR))
	
= 0 for n ̸= 0.
Proof. Set M = Γ(X; L ). By (9.6.6), we have
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) ≃RHomtop
C

Φ(L), OXan(−λ + 2ρ)[dX]
	
.
Hence, forgetting the topology and the equivariance, the cohomology groups of
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) are concentrated at degree 0. On the other hand,
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) is represented by a complex in FNGR whose neg-
ative components vanish. Hence it is a strict complex.
Q.E.D.
10.4 Vanishing Theorem
By using the result of the preceding paragraph, we shall prove the following
statement.
Theorem 10.4.1. Let N be a Harish-Chandra module. Then we have
(i) RHomtop
(g,KR)(N, C∞(GR)) ∈Db(FNGR) is strict,
(ii) Hn(RHomtop
(g,KR)(N, C∞(GR))) = 0 for n ̸= 0.
Proof.
Since RHomtop
(g,KR)(N, C∞(GR)) is represented by a complex in
FNGR whose negative components vanish, it is enough to show that, forgetting
topology,
Extn
(g,KR)(N, C∞(GR)) = 0
for n ̸= 0.
(10.4.1)
We shall prove this by the descending induction on n. If n ≫0, this is
obvious because the global dimension of Mod(g, K) is ﬁnite.
We may assume that N is simple without the loss of generality.
By [2, 5], N/˜nN ̸= 0, where ˜n = [b, b] is the nilpotent radical of b. Since the
center z(g) acts by scalar on N, N/˜nN is U(t)-ﬁnite. Hence there exists a sur-
jective (t, T ∩K)-linear homomorphism N/˜nN ↠V for some one-dimensional
(t, T ∩K)-module V . Let λ ∈t∗be the character of V . Since S/(k∩˜n)S →V is
a surjective homomorphism for some irreducible M-submodule S of N, λ|k∩t
is the lowest weight of S, and hence λ satisﬁes (10.2.2).
Let us take a K-equivariant (DX,λ)|Kx0- module L ′ such that L ′(x0) ∼= V
as (B ∩K)-modules, and set L = Dj∗L ′.
Then by Lemma 10.2.2, Hom(g,K)(N, Γ(X; L )) contains a non-zero ele-
ment. Thus we obtain an exact sequence of (g, K)-modules
0 →N →M →M ′ →0
with M = Γ(X; L ).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
227
This gives an exact sequence
Extn
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) →Extn
(g,KR)(N, C∞(GR))
→Extn+1
(g,KR)(M ′, C∞(GR)),
in which the ﬁrst term vanishes for n > 0 by Proposition 10.3.1 and the last
term vanishes by the induction hypothesis. Thus we obtain the desired result.
Q.E.D.
By duality, we obtain the following proposition.
Theorem 10.4.2. Let N be a Harish-Chandra module. Then we have
(i) Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)N ∈Db(DFNGR) is strict,
(ii) Hn(Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)N) = 0 for n ̸= 0.
Recall that the maximal globalization functor MG: HC(g, K) →FNGR is
given by
MG(M) = H0
RHomtop
(g,KR)(M ∗, C∞(GR))
	
and the minimal globalization functor mg: HC(g, K) →DFNGR is given by
mg(M) = H0
Γc(GR; DistGR)
L⊗(g,KR)M
	
.
We denote by MGGR (resp. mgGR) the subcategory of FNGR (resp.
DFNGR) consisting of objects isomorphic to MG(M) (resp. mg(M)) for a
Harish-Chandra module M (see § 1.1). Then both MGGR and mgGR are equiv-
alent to the category HC(g, K) of Harish-Chandra modules.
The above theorem together with Theorem 10.4.1 shows the following
result.
Theorem 10.4.3.
(i) The functor M →MG(M) (resp. M →mg(M)) is
an exact functor from the category HC(g, K) of Harish-Chandra modules
to FNGR (resp. DFNGR).
(ii) Any morphism in MGGR or mgGR is strict in FNGR or DFNGR (i.e.,
with a closed range).
(iii) Any GR-invariant closed subspace of E in MGGR (resp. mgGR) belongs
to MGGR (resp. mgGR).
(iv) MGGR is closed by extensions in FNGR, namely, if 0 →E′ →E →
E′′ →0 is a strict exact sequence in FNGR, and E′ and E′′ belong to
MGGR, then so does E. A similar statement holds for mgGR.
Here the exactness in (i) means that they send the short exact sequences to
strictly exact sequences.
Proof. Let us only show the statements on the maximal globalization.
(i) follows immediately from Theorem 10.4.1.

Let M, M ′ be Harish-Chandra modules, and let u: MG(M) →MG(M ′)

is a morphism in HC(g, K) and MG(ψ) = u. Let I be the image of ψ, Then
MG(M) →MG(I) is surjective and MG(I) is a closed subspace of MG(M ′)
by (i).
(iii)
Let M be a Harish-Chandra module and E a GR-invariant closed sub-
space of MG(M). Then N := HC(E) ⊂M is a Harish-Chandra module and
MG(N) is a closed subspace of MG(M) by (ii), and it contains N as a dense
subspace. Since E is also the closure of N, E = MG(N).
(iv)
We have an exact sequence 0 →HC(E′) →HC(E) →HC(E′′) →0.
Since HC(E′) and HC(E′′) are Harish-Chandra modules, so is HC(E). Hence
we have a commutative diagram with strictly exact rows:
0
 E′


E


E′′


0
0
 MG(HC(E′))
 MG(HC(E))
 MG(HC(E′′))
 0.
Since the left and right vertical arrows are isomorphisms, the middle vertical
arrow is also an isomorphism.
Q.E.D.
Let us denote by Db
MG(FNGR) the full subcategory of Db(FNGR) consist-
ing of E such that E is strict and the cohomologies of E belong to MGGR.
Similarly, we deﬁne Db
mg(DFNGR). Then the following result follows immedi-
ately from the preceding theorem and Lemma 2.3.1.
Corollary 10.4.4. The category Db
MG(FNGR) is a triangulated full subcate-
gory of Db(FNGR), namely, it is closed by the translation functors, and closed
by distinguished triangles (if E′ →E →E′′ →E′[1] is a distinguished triangle
in Db(FNGR) and E′ and E belong to Db
MG(FNGR), then so does E′′).
This corollary together with Theorem 10.4.1 implies the following corollary.
Corollary 10.4.5. If M ∈Db(Mod f(g, K)) has Harish-Chandra modules as
cohomologies, then RHomtop
(g,KR)(M, C∞(GR)) belongs to Db
MG(FNGR).
Hence we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 10.4.6. Let λ ∈t∗, K ∈Db
GR,τ−λ,R-c(CX) and M ∈Db
coh(DX,λ, G).
Then we have
(i) RHomtop
DX,λ(M ⊗K, OXan(λ)) belongs to Db
MG(FNGR).
(ii) R Γtop
c

Xan; K ⊗ΩXan(−λ)
L⊗DX,λM
	
belongs to Db
mg(DFNGR).

Equivariant Derived Category and Representation
229
Proof.
Since (ii) is the dual statement of (i), it is enough to prove (i). By
Matsuki correspondence (Theorem 9.4.2), there exists L ∈Db
Kan,τ−λ,C-c(CXan)
such that K ≃Φ(L). By Theorem 9.6.1, there exists L ∈Db
K, coh(DX,λ) such
that DRX(L ) ≃L. Then Proposition 9.6.3 implies
RHomtop
DX,λ(M ⊗K, OXan(λ))
≃RHomtop
(g,KR)(Lj∗(M
D◦IndG
K L ), C∞(SR))[−dX].
Then the result follows from Corollary 10.4.5 and Proposition 9.3.2.
Q.E.D.
Let us illustrate Theorem 10.4.6 in the case M = DX,λ and K is a twisted
GR-equivariant sheaf supported on a GR-orbit Z of Xan.
Let us take a point x ∈Z. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional GR∩B(x)-module
whose diﬀerential coincides with gR ∩b(x) →b(x)
λ−→C →EndC(V ).
Then the Cauchy-Riemann equations give a complex

B(GR) ⊗V ⊗
•6
n(x)
GR∩B(x)
.
(10.4.2)
Then its cohomology groups belong to MGGR.
Indeed, if F is the τλ-twisted local system on Z associated with V ∗(see
Lemma 9.1.1), then (10.4.2) is isomorphic to RHomtop
DX,λ(M ⊗i!F, OXan(λ))
(up to a shift). Here i: Z →Xan is the embedding,

1 Introduction
Amenability was introduced in 1929 by J. von Neumann [vN29] for discrete
groups, and in 1950 by M. Day [Day50] for general locally compact groups.
Originating from harmonic analysis and representation theory, amenability
extended to a well-established body of mathematics, with applications in:
dynamical systems, operator algebras, graph theory, metric geometry,. . . One
deﬁnite advantage of amenability for groups is the equivalence of various,
apparently remote, characterizations. So in Chapter 1 we survey the classical
theory of amenability for a locally compact group G, (our basic reference being
Appendix G in [BHV]) and we establish the equivalence between:
•
G is amenable, in the sense that every action of G by homeomorphisms
on a compact space X, ﬁxes some probability measure on X;
•
any aﬃne G-action on a compact convex set (in a locally convex Hausdorﬀ
space) has a ﬁxed point;
•
G admits an invariant mean;

236
A. Valette
•
(Reiter’s property (P1)) For every compact subset Q ⊂G and ϵ > 0, there
exists f ∈L1(G)1,+ such that
maxx∈Q∥λG(x)f −f∥≤ϵ;
•
(Reiter’s property (P2)) The left regular representation λG on L2(G) al-
most has invariant vectors;
•
the representation ∞λG almost has invariant vectors.
In Chapter 2, we digress on ergodic theory for group actions on measure
spaces. The goal of the chapter is to establish Moore’s ergodicity theorem,
stating that if Γ is a lattice in a non-compact simple Lie group G, and H is
a non-compact closed subgroup of G, then Γ acts ergodically on G/H. We
deduce it from the Howe-Moore vanishing theorem, stating that coeﬃcients
of unitary representations of G having no non-zero ﬁxed vector, go to zero at
inﬁnity of G. Our basic reference for that chapter is [BM00].
In Chapter 3, we explain how amenability is used in the proof of Margulis’
super-rigidity theorem. Although semisimple Lie groups are very far from
being amenable, they contain a co-compact amenable subgroup (namely a
minimal parabolic subgroup) and this fact, together with Moore’s ergodicity
theorem, plays a crucial role in super-rigidity. References for this Chapter are
[Mar91] and [Zim84].
The presentation follows rather closely the CIME course taught at San Ser-
volo in June 2004. I thank heartily Enrico Casadio Tarabusi, Andrea D’Agnolo
and Massimo Picardello for bringing me to that magical place.
2 Amenability for Locally Compact Groups
2.1 Deﬁnition, Examples, and First Characterizations
For a compact space X, we denote by M(X) the space of probability measures
on X.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A locally compact group G is amenable if, for every compact
space X endowed with a G-action, there exists a G-ﬁxed point in M(X) (i.e.
G ﬁxes a probability measure on X)
Example 2.1. : Compact groups are amenable.
Indeed, let dg be normalized Haar measure on the compact group G. Let G
act on the compact space X. Pick any µ ∈M(X). Then ν =
7
G(g∗µ) dg is a
ﬁxed point in M(X).
Example 2.2. : SL2(R) is not amenable.

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
237
To see this, let SL2(R) act by fractional linear transformations on P 1(R) =
R ∪{∞}. Then SL2(R) ﬁxes no measure at all on P 1(R). Indeed look at
subgroups
N =
 1 ∗
0 1

(= translations on R);
A =

a
0
0 a−1

: a > 0

(= dilations on R);
The only N-invariant measures on P 1(R) are of the form s dx + t δ∞(where
dx is Lebesgue measure on R). Among these, the only A -invariant measures
are the t δ∞’s. But those are not w-invariant, where w =
 0 1
−1 0

(so that
w(x) = −1
x ).
Proposition 2.1. The following are equivalent:
i) G is amenable;
ii) Any aﬃne action of G on a (non-empty) convex, compact subset of a
Hausdorﬀ, locally convex topological vector space, has a ﬁxed point.
Proof: (ii) ⇒(i) : If X is a compact space, then M(X) is a convex subset
of C(X)∗(space of all Borel measures on X), and M(X) is compact in the
weak-∗topology.
(i) ⇒(ii) : Let C be a compact convex subset in E. To each µ ∈M(C),
we associate its barycentre b(µ) ∈C: this is the unique point in C such that,
for every f ∈E∗:
f(b(µ)) =

C
f(c) dµ(c)
(formally: b(µ) =
7
C c dµ(c)). If µ = 
i λiδci is an atomic measure, i.e. a
convex combination of Dirac masses, then b(µ) = 
i λici, and this can be ex-
tended to M(C) using density of atomic measures in M(C) (see Theorem 3.27
in [Rud73] for details). Clearly b commutes with aﬃne maps of C: b(T∗µ) =
T(b(µ)). In particular, if µ is a G-ﬁxed probability measure on C, then b(µ)
is a G-ﬁxed point in C.
□
Here is the famous Markov-Kakutani theorem.
Theorem 2.1. Every abelian group is amenable.
Proof: Let G be an abelian group, acting on a compact convex subset C
in E. For g ∈G, deﬁne An(g) : C →C by
An(g)x =
1
n + 1
n

i=0
gix.

238
A. Valette
Let G be the semi-group generated by the An(g)’s (n ≥0, g ∈G). For every
γ ∈G, the set γ(C) is convex compact.
Claim: 8
γ∈G γ(C) ̸= ∅
It is enough to see that γ1(C) ∩. . . ∩γm(C) ̸= ∅, for γ1, . . . , γm ∈G. Set
γ = γ1γ2 . . . γm ∈G. Since G is abelian: γ(C) ⊂γi(C) for i = 1, . . . , m, proving
the claim.
Take x0 ∈8
γ∈G γ(C). We claim that x0 is G-ﬁxed.
For every n ≥0, g ∈G, there exists x ∈C such that An(g)x = x0. For
f ∈E∗:
|f(x0 −gx0)| =
f
3
1
n + 1
3 n

i=0
gix −
n

i=0
gi+1x
44
=
1
n + 1|f(x −gn+1x)| ≤
2K
n + 1
where K = max{|f(c)| : c ∈C}. So f(x0) = f(gx0) for every f ∈E∗,
therefore x0 = gx0.
□
Deﬁnition 2.2. A mean on G is a linear form m on L∞(G), such that:
i) m(1) = 1;
ii) m(f) ≥0 for every f ∈L∞(G), f ≥0
Example 2.3. If µ is a Borel probability measure on G, absolutely continuous
with respect to Haar measure, then m(f) =
7
G f dµ deﬁnes a mean on G.
There are some important diﬀerences between probability measures and
means:
1. means make up a convex compact subset in L∞(G)∗(for the weak-∗topol-
ogy);
2. for A ∈B (the Borel subsets of G), let χA be the characteristic function
on G; let m be a mean on G, set m(A) = m(χA). The map m : B →
[0, 1] : A →m(A) satisﬁes:
(i) m(G) = 1;
(ii) If A1, . . . , An are pairwise disjoint, then m(A1 ∪. . . ∪An) = m(A1) +
. . . + m(An).
This second property is ﬁnite additivity (as opposed to σ-additivity).
In other words, we may think of a mean as a probability measure which is
only ﬁnitely additive.
Proposition 2.2. The following are equivalent:
i) G is amenable;
ii) G admits an invariant mean.

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
239
Proof: (i) ⇒(ii) Follows from compactness and convexity of the set of
means.
(ii) ⇒(i) Let G act on a compact space X. Fix x0 ∈X. For f ∈C(X),
set φf(g) = f(gx0). The map
φ : C(X) →L∞(G) : f →φf
is G-equivariant. So if m is an invariant mean on G, then µ(f) = m(φf)
deﬁnes a G-invariant linear functional on C(X). This µ is positive, unital, so
by the Riesz representation theorem it is a probability measure on X.
□
Example 2.4. The free group F2 on two generators a, b is not amenable.
To see it, assume by contradiction that F2 is amenable. Let m be an invariant
mean. Set
A = {w ∈F2 : w starts with a non-zero power (positive or negative)of a}.
Then A ∪aA = F2, so m(A) + m(aA) ≥1 and m(A) = m(aA), so m(A) ≥1
2.
On the other hand A, bA, b2A are pairwise disjoint, so m(A) + m(bA) +
m(b2A) ≤1; with m(A) = m(bA) = m(b2A), this gives m(A) ≤1

tradiction.
2.2 Stability Properties
Proposition 2.3. Every closed subgroup of an amenable group is amenable.
We postpone the proof until the end of section 2.5.
Proposition 2.4. :
i) Every quotient of an amenable group is amenable.
ii) Let 1 →N →G →G/N →1 be a short exact sequence, with N closed,
amenable in G. The following are equivalent:
•
G is amenable;
•
G/N is amenable.
Proof: (i) Every action of G/N can be seen as an action of G.
(ii) Assume that G/N is amenable. Let G act aﬃnely on a non-empty,
compact convex subset C. Since N is amenable, the set CN of N-ﬁxed points is
convex, compact and non-empty. Since N is normal, the set CN is G-invariant,
and the G-action factors through G/N. We conclude by amenability of G/N.
□
Example 2.5. Solvable groups are amenable.
This is proved by induction on the length of the derived series.

A. Valette
Example 2.6. Borel subgroups are amenable. More precisely, if G = KAN is a
semisimple Lie group, and P = MAN is a minimal parabolic subgroup, then
P is amenable.
Example 2.7. Non-compact semisimple Lie groups are not amenable.
Indeed, upon replacing G by G/Z(G), we may assume that G has trivial
centre. By root theory, G has a closed subgroup isomorphic to (P)SL2(R), so
G is not amenable.
Proposition 2.5. A connected Lie group G is amenable if and only if G is
an extension of a solvable group by a compact group.
Proof: Let G = RS be a Levi decomposition (with R closed, normal,
solvable, and S semisimple). Then G is amenable if and only if S/(R ∩S) is
amenable, if and only if S is compact.

2.3 Lattices in Locally Compact Groups
Deﬁnition 2.3. A discrete subgroup Γ ⊂G is a lattice if G/Γ carries a
G-invariant probability measure. A lattice Γ is uniform, or co-compact, if
G/Γ is compact.
Example 2.8.
1) Γ = Zn is a uniform lattice in G = Rn;
2) The discrete Heisenberg group
Γ = H(Z) =

⎛
⎝

is a uniform lattice in the Heisenberg group G = H(R);
3) Γ = Z2 ⋊⎛

1 1
⎞
⎠
n Z is a uniform lattice in
SOL = R2 ⋊⎛
⎝et

⎠
R;
4) Γ = SLn(Z) (n ≥2) is a non-uniform lattice in G = SLn(R);
5) Γ = Spn(Z) (n ≥1) is a non-uniform lattice in G = Spn(R);
6) The free group F2 can be embedded as a non-uniform lattice in SL2(R).
E.g.,
F2 ≃⟨

1 2
0 1

,

1 0


⟩
is of index 12 in SL2(Z);
7) Let Γg be the fundamental group of a closed Riemann surface of genus
g ≥2. Then Γg embeds as a uniform lattice in G = PSL2(R).

More examples of lattices will be given in section 4.5.
Proposition 2.6. Let Γ be a lattice in G. The following are equivalent:
i) G is amenable;
ii) Γ is amenable.
Proof of (ii) ⇒(i): Let G act aﬃnely on a compact convex subset C. Let
µ be an invariant probability measure on G/Γ. Since Γ is amenable, the set CΓ
is closed, convex, non-empty. For x0 ∈CΓ , the orbit map G →C : g →g.x0
is (right) Γ-invariant, so factors through G/Γ. So x =
7
G/Γ y.x0 dµ(y) ∈C,
and this x is a G-ﬁxed point, by G-invariance of µ.

2.4 Reiter’s Property (P1)
We denote by λG the left regular representation of G on the space of all
functions G →C. We set L1(G)1,+ = {f ∈L1(G) : f ≥0, ∥f∥1 = 1}.
Theorem 2.2. The following are equivalent:
i) G is amenable;
ii) (Reiter’s property (P1), see [Rei52]) For every compact subset Q ⊂G and
ϵ > 0, there exists f ∈L1(G)1,+ such that
maxx∈Q∥λG(x)f −f∥1 ≤ϵ.
Proof: (ii) ⇒(i) Using the assumption, we ﬁnd a net (fi)i∈I in L1(G)1,+
such that limi∈I ∥λG(x)fi −fi∥1 = 0 for every x ∈G. Let m be any weak-∗
limit point of the fi’s in the set of means on G. Then m is a G-invariant mean
on G.
(i) ⇒(ii) Recall that, for f ∈L1(G), φ ∈L∞(G):
(f ⋆φ)(x) =

G
f(y)φ(y−1x) dy =

G
f(y)(λG(y)φ)(x) dy
so that f ⋆φ ∈L∞(G).
Let m be an invariant mean on G. Since m is continuous on L∞(G), we
have (Caution: see “Added on proof” at the end of the paper!)
(1)
m(f ⋆φ) = m(φ)
if f ∈L1(G)1,+.
Since L1(G)1,+ is weak-∗dense in the space of all means on G, there exists
a net (fi)i∈I such that for every φ ∈L∞(G):
lim
i∈I

G
fi(y)φ(y) dy = m(φ).

242
A. Valette
For every f ∈L1(G)1,+, we also have, because of (1):
lim
i∈I

G
fi(y)(f ⋆φ)(y) dy = m(φ).
From this, we deduce limi∈I(f ⋆fi −fi) = 0 in the weak topology of L1(G).
Consider now the space E of all functions L1(G)1,+ →L1(G), endowed
with the pointwise norm topology. The set
Σ = {(f ⋆g −g)f∈L1(G)1,+ : g ∈L1(G)1,+}
is convex in E, and its weak closure contains 0, by the previous observation.
Since the weak closure of Σ coincides with its closure in the pointwise topology
(a general fact from functional analysis, see Theorem 3.12 in [Rud73]), there
exists a net (gj)j∈J in L1(G)1,+ such that limj∈J ∥f ⋆gj −gj∥1 = 0 for
every f ∈L1(G)1,+. Since ∥gj∥1 = 1, this convergence is uniform on norm-
compact subsets of L1(G)1,+. One such subset is {λG(x)f : x ∈Q}. So ﬁx
f0 ∈L1(G)1,+, and ﬁnd j ∈G large enough so that ∥λ(x)(f0 ⋆gj) −gj∥1 ≤ϵ
2
for x ∈Q ∪{1}. Set fQ,ϵ = f0 ⋆gj: then fQ,ϵ ∈L1(G)1,+ and
∥λG(x)fQ,ϵ −fQ,ϵ∥1
≤∥λG(x)(f0 ⋆gj) −gj∥1 + ∥gj −(f0 ⋆gj)∥1 ≤ϵ
for every x ∈Q.

2.5 Reiter’s Property (P2)
Deﬁnition 2.4. A unitary representation π of G almost has invariant vec-
tors, or weakly contains the trivial representation if, for every compact
subset Q of G and every ϵ > 0, there exists a non-zero ξ ∈Hπ such that
maxg∈Q∥π(g)ξ −ξ∥≤ϵ∥ξ∥.
For a unitary representation π, we denote by ∞π the (Hilbert) direct sum
of countably many copies of π.
Theorem 2.3. The following are equivalent:
i) G is amenable;
ii) (Reiter’s property (P2), see [Rei64]) The left regular representation λG
almost has invariant vectors.
iii) The representation ∞λG almost has invariant vectors.
Proof: (i) ⇒(ii) Fix a compact subset Q ⊂G and ϵ > 0. As G is
amenable, by Reiter’s property we ﬁnd f ∈L1(G)1,+ such that ∥λG(x)f −
f∥1 ≤ϵ. Set g = √f. Then g ∈L2(G) and ∥g∥2 = 1. Moreover, using
|a −b|2 ≤|a2 −b2| for a, b ≥0, we get

□
Finally we reach a result left unproved in section 2.2:
Corollary 2.1. Closed subgroups of amenable groups are amenable.

244
A. Valette
Proof: Let H be a closed subgroup of the amenable group G. Choose
a measurable section s for G →H\G; so every g ∈G is written uniquely
g = hs(y), with h ∈H, y ∈H\G. This gives an H-equivariant measurable
identiﬁcation G ≃H × H\G, inducing a unitary map L2(G) →L2(H) ⊗
L2(H\G) intertwining λG|H and λH ⊗1. Choosing an orthonormal basis of
L2(H\G), we identify λH⊗1 with the direct sum of [G : H] copies of λH, which
we embed as a subrepresentation in ∞λH. This means that ∞λH almost has
invariant vectors, hence H is amenable by Theorem 2.3.
□
2.6 Amenability in Riemannian Geometry
In the Introduction, we mentioned that amenability became relevant in various
ﬁelds of mathematics. In this section, independent of the rest of the Chapter,
we substantiate this claim and indicate how amenability enters Riemannian
geometry.
Let N be a complete Riemannian manifold. It carries a Laplace operator
∆N = d∗d = −div ◦grad.
This operator is self-adjoint on L2(N), so it has a non-negative spectrum, and
we denote by λ0(N) the bottom of its spectrum:
λ0(N) = inf{λ ≥0 : λ ∈SpecL2(N)∆N}.
The following result was obtained by R. Brooks [Bro81].
Theorem 2.4. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. Let ˜
M be the uni-
versal cover of M, and π1(M) its fundamental group. The following are equiv-
alent:
i) π1(M) is amenable;
ii) λ0( ˜
M) = 0.
□
Since π1(M) only depends of the topological structure of M, this shows
in particular that the property λ0( ˜
M) = 0 does not depend on the choice of
a Riemannian structure on M.
Example 2.9.
1. λ0(Rn) = 0, which gives another proof of the amenability
of Zn.
2. If H2 denotes the Poincar´e disk, with the metric of constant curvature −1,
then λ0(H2) = 1
4, which gives another proof of the non-amenability of the
surface group Γg, g ≥2.
3 Measurable Ergodic Theory
3.1 Deﬁnitions and Examples
In this section, the context will be the following:

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
245
•
G is a locally compact, σ-compact group;
•
(X, µ) is a standard measure space;
•
G is acting on (X, µ), i.e. we are given a measurable map G × X →X :
(g, x) →gx which is an action such that, for every g ∈G, the measure g∗µ
is equivalent to µ (i.e. they have the same null sets); when this happens,
we say that µ is quasi-invariant.
Deﬁnition 3.1. The measure µ is invariant if g∗µ = µ for every g ∈G;
Deﬁnition 3.2. The action of G on (X, µ) is ergodic if every G-invariant
measurable subset A is either null or co-null (i.e. µ(A) = 0 or µ(X −A) = 0).
Example 3.1. (invariant measures on homogeneous spaces, see section 9 in
[Wei65]) Let L be a closed subgroup of G; there always exists a quasi-invariant
measure on G/L; there exists an invariant measure on G/L if and only if the
restriction to L of the modular function of G, coincides with the modular
function of L. Since the action of G on G/L is transitive, it is trivially ergodic.
Example 3.2. (irrational rotation) Take X = S1, µ = normalized Lebesgue
measure. Fix θ ∈R −Q. Let G = Z act on S1 by powers of the irrational
rotation T of angle 2πθ:
T(z) = e2πiθz.
This action is measure-preserving, and ergodic.
To check ergodicity, it is convenient to appeal to Fourier series: if A ⊂S1 is
T-invariant, let χA be its characteristic function, and
χA(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
anzn
be its Fourier expansion in L2(S1). Then
T ∗(χA)(z) = χA(T −1z) =
+∞

n=−∞
e−2πinθanzn.
By T-invariance, we must have an = e−2πinθan for every n ∈Z, so an = 0 for
n ̸= 0, as θ is irrational; thus χA is constant, i.e. either χA = 0 and µ(A) = 0,
or χA = 1 and µ(A) = 1.
Example 3.3. (linear action on tori) The linear action of SLn(Z) on Rn leaves
Zn invariant, so descends to an action on the n-torus Tn = Rn/Zn. Let µ
be normalized Lebesgue measure on Tn: since Lebesgue measure is SLn(R)-
invariant on Rn, the measure µ is SLn(Z)-invariant on Tn. This action is
ergodic.

246
A. Valette
To check ergodicity of this action, we use n-variable Fourier series: if A ⊂
Tn is SLn(Z)-invariant, let χA be its characteristic function, and
χA(z1, . . . , zn) =

r∈Zn
arzr
(where zr = zr1
1 . . . zrn
n ) be its Fourier expansion in L2(Tn). For g ∈SLn(Z),
one has
(gχA)(z) = χA(g−1z) =

r∈Zn
arz
tg−1r =

r∈Zn
a tgrzr.
Since A is SLn(Z)-invariant, we have a tgr = ar for every r ∈Zn and g ∈
SLn(Z); i.e. ar is constant on SLn(Z)-orbits on Zn. Notice that non-trivial
orbits are inﬁnite. Since (ar)r∈Zn ∈ℓ2(Zn), we must have ar = 0 for r ̸= 0.
So χA is constant and we conclude as in Example 3.2.
Note that in example 3.3, SLn(Z) can be replaced by any subgroup with
inﬁnite non-trivial orbits on Zn. For n = 2, one can for example take the
inﬁnite cyclic subgroup generated by

2 1
1 1

.
Deﬁnition 3.3. A Borel space is countably separated if there exists a
countable family of Borel subsets separating points (i.e. two distinct points
can be put in two disjoint subsets of the countable family).
For example, Rn is countably separated since we can take the collection of
balls with rational centres and rational radii as a countable family separating
points.
Proposition 3.1. Let S be countably separated. If the G-action on (X, µ) is
ergodic, any measurable G-invariant map f : X →S, is almost everywhere
constant.
Proof: Let (Aj)j≥1 be a sequence of Borel subsets separating points in
S. Let Pn be the partition of S generated by A1, . . . , An. For every B ∈Pn,
the set f −1(B) is G-invariant, so it is either null or co-null; moreover there
exists a unique Bn ∈Pn such that f −1(Bn) is co-null. The sequence (Bn)n≥1
is decreasing, and the intersection 8∞
n=1 Bn is reduced to one point s, as the
Aj’s separate points in S. So f(x) = s almost everywhere.
□
The converse of Proposition 3.1 holds in the ﬁnite measure-preserving
case. The following result, due to Koopman [Koo31], is known today under
the name “Koopmanism”.
Proposition 3.2. Let G act on the probability space (X, µ), preserving µ. The
following are equivalent:
i) The action is ergodic;

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
247
ii) Any G-invariant function in L2(X, µ) is constant almost everywhere.
iii) Set L2
0(X, µ) = {f ∈L2(X, µ) :
7
X f dµ = 0} (the orthogonal of constants
in L2(X, µ)). The representation of G on L2
0(X, µ) has no non-zero ﬁxed
vector.
Proof: (i) ⇒(ii) : Follows from Proposition 3.1.
(ii) ⇒(iii): Obvious.
(iii) ⇒(i) : If a Borel subset A is G-invariant, set
ξA(x) =
 1 −µ(A) if x ∈A
−µ(A) if x /∈A
ξA is a G-invariant function in L2
0(X, µ), so ξA = 0; this gives the result.
□
Example 3.4. Proposition 3.2 false in inﬁnite measure. Indeed, let Z act
by translation on R: the action is not ergodic (why?). However the only
Z-invariant function in L2(R) is the constant 0.
3.2 Moore’s Ergodicity Theorem
We have seen that, if L is a closed subgroup of G, then the action of G on G/L
is trivially ergodic. A more interesting situation arises by considering H, L,
two closed subgroups of G. Question: when is the H-action on G/L ergodic?
Moore’s theorem gives the answer.
Theorem 3.1. The following are equivalent:
i) The H-action on G/L is ergodic;
ii) The L-action on H\G is ergodic.
Example 3.5. Let Γ = SL2(Z) act by fractional linear transformations on the
real projective line P1(R) ≃S1. Is the action ergodic? Write P1(R) = G/P,
where G = SL2(R) and P =
 ∗∗
0 ∗

. By Theorem 3.1, ergodicity of Γ on
G/P (situation with no invariant measure) is equivalent to ergodicity of P on
Γ\G (situation with a ﬁnite invariant measure).
Later we will see that these actions are ergodic.
Lemma 3.1. Let H be a closed subgroup of G; let (X, µ) be a G-space. The
following are equivalent:
i) H acts ergodically on X;
ii) G acts ergodically (via the diagonal action) on X × G/H.

248
A. Valette
Proof: (i) ⇒(ii) Contraposing, assume that G is not ergodic on X×G/H.
So ﬁnd A ⊂X×G/H, neither null nor co-null, G-invariant. Let p : X×G/H →
G/H be the second projection, set Ay = p−1(y) ∩A for y ∈G/H. Since p
is G-equivariant, one has Agy = gAy. Since G acts transitively on G/H, this
implies (by Fubini) that AeH is neither null nor co-null. But AeH is an H-
invariant subset in X, so H is not ergodic on X.
(ii) ⇒(i) Contraposing, assume that H is not ergodic on X. So ﬁnd
B ⊂X, neither null nor co-null, H-invariant. Choosing a measurable section
s for G →G/H, we may deﬁne
A = {(x, y) ∈X × G/H : x ∈s(y)B}.
The set A is then G-invariant: indeed, for g ∈G and (x, y) ∈A, we must check
that gx ∈s(gy)B. But s(gy) = gs(y)h for some h ∈H so gx ∈gs(y)B =
gs(y)hB = s(gy)B. One sees easily that A is neither null or co-null.
□
Proof of Theorem 3.1: By lemma 3.1, the action of H on G/L is ergodic
if and only if the action of G on G/L × H\G is ergodic, if and only if the
action of L on H\G is ergodic.
□
Deﬁnition 3.4. Let Γ be a lattice in a semisimple Lie group G. Say that Γ
is irreducible if, for any normal subgroup N of positive dimension in G, the
image of Γ in G/N is dense.
This deﬁnition is designed to eliminate examples of the form Γ = Γ1 × Γ2
in G = G1 × G2, with Γi a lattice in Gi (i = 1, 2).
Example 3.6. Let σ be the non-trivial element of Gal(Q(
√
2)/Q):
σ(r + s
√
2) = r −s
√
2.
Then SLn(Z[
√
2]) sits as a non-uniform irreducible lattice in SLn(R) ×
SLn(R), via the embedding g →(g, σ(g)).
Here is Moore’s ergodicity theorem [Moo66]:
Theorem 3.2. Let G be a connected, semisimple Lie group with ﬁnite centre.
Let Γ be an irreducible lattice in G, and H a closed subgroup in G. If H is
not compact, then Γ acts ergodically on G/H.
In the next section, we will deduce this result from the Howe-Moore van-
ishing theorem. Notice that Theorem 3.2 implies, in Example 3.5, that the
action of Γ on G/P is ergodic.

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity

3.3 The Howe-Moore Vanishing Theorem
Let π be a (strongly continuous) unitary representation of a locally compact
group G, on a Hilbert space H. Denote by Hπ(G) the space of ﬁxed vectors
in H.
Deﬁnition 3.5. π is a C0-representation if all coeﬃcients of π vanish at
inﬁnity on G, i.e. limg→∞⟨π(g)ξ|η⟩= 0 for every ξ, η ∈H.
Example 3.7. The left regular representation λG of G on L2(G) is C0.
Indeed, if ξ, η ∈L2(G) have compact support in G, then so does g →
⟨λG(g)ξ|η⟩. By density of Cc(G) in L2(G), we conclude that every coeﬃcient
vanishes at inﬁnity.
Example 3.8. C0-representations have no ﬁnite-dimension subrepresentation.
The reason is: if σ is a ﬁnite-dimensional unitary representation, then the
identity 1 = | det σ(g)| prevents σ from being C0. Observe that this implies
in particular that a C0-representation has no non-zero ﬁxed vector.
Here is the Howe-Moore theorem ([HM79], Theorem 5.1).
Theorem 3.3. Let G = %
i Gi be a semisimple Lie group with ﬁnite centre
and simple factors Gi’s, and let π be a unitary representation of G. Assume
that Hπ(Gi) = 0 for every i. Then π is C0.
From this we deduce Moore ergodicity.
Proof of Theorem 3.2: Let H be a closed non-compact subgroup of G.
To prove that Γ is ergodic on G/H, by lemma 3.1 it is enough to prove that
H is ergodic on G/Γ. So let π be the representation of G on L2
0(G/Γ). Take
a function on G/Γ which is Gi-invariant, lift to a left-Gi, right-Γ invariant
function on G, and project to a right-Γ invariant function on Gi\G. Since
Γ is irreducible, the image of Γ in Gi\G is dense, hence this function must
be a.e. constant. This shows that π(Gi) has no non-zero invariant function in
L2
0(G/Γ). By Howe-Moore (Theorem 3.3), π is a C0-representation. So π|H
is C0 as well, in particular (by Example 3.8) π|H has no non-zero invariant
vector. By Proposition 3.2 (valid since we have a ﬁnite invariant measure on
G/Γ), H is ergodic on G/Γ.
□
We will give a complete proof of the Howe-Moore theorem in the case of
SL2(R), and then indicate brieﬂy how to pass from SL2(R) to a more general
semisimple Lie group.
Let G be a locally compact group, and let α = (an)n≥1 be a sequence in
G. Set

Proposition 3.3. Let π be a (strongly continuous) unitary representation of
G. Let ξ, ξ0 be vectors in H such that limn→∞π(an)ξ = ξ0 in the weak topol-
ogy. Then π(x)ξ0 = ξ0 for every x ∈N +
α .
Proof: Fix x ∈U +
α . Let (ank)k≥1 be a subsequence of α such that
limn→∞a−1
nk xank = 1. For every η ∈H:
|⟨(π(x)ξ0 −ξ0)|η⟩| = |⟨π(x)ξ0|η⟩−⟨ξ0|η⟩|

Lemma 3.2. Let π be a unitary representation of G = SL2(R). If a vector
ξ ∈H is N-invariant, then it is G-invariant.
Proof: For a vector η ∈H of norm 1, consider φη(g) = ⟨π(g)η|η⟩, the
associated coeﬃcient function. For any closed subgroup H ⊂G, the vector η
is H-ﬁxed if and only if φ|H = 1, if and only if φ is H-bi-invariant (by the
equality case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality).
Here, ξ is N-invariant, so φξ =: φ is N-bi-invariant.
1st step: ξ is P-invariant. Indeed, by right N-invariance, φ descends to a
function ˜φ on G/N ≃R2 −{0}, which is continuous and constant on orbits
of N. In particular, ˜φ is constant on lines parallel to the horizontal axis, and
distinct from this axis. By continuity, ˜φ is equal to 1 on the horizontal axis.
Observing that this axis (minus {0}) is the P-orbit of
 1
0

, we get that
φ|P = 1, i.e. ξ is P-ﬁxed.
2nd step: Since φ is P-bi-invariant, φ descends to a function φ on G/P ≃
P1(R), which is continuous and constant on P-orbits. But there are exactly
two P-orbits, namely {0} and its complement. By continuity we have φ ≡1,
so φ ≡1 and ξ is G-ﬁxed.

and K = SO(2). In view of the Cartan decomposition G = KA+K, to show
vanishing of coeﬃcients it is enough to show that, for every ξ, η ∈H one has
limt→+∞⟨π(at)ξ|η⟩= 0. By compactness of closed balls in Hilbert spaces for
the weak topology, we ﬁnd an accumulation point ξ0 of the π(at)ξ’s:
lim
n→∞π(atn)ξ = ξ0
in the weak topology. By Mautner’s phenomenon (Proposition 3.3) and
example 3.9, ξ0 must be N-ﬁxed. By lemma 3.2, the vector ξ0 is also G-ﬁxed.
By assumption this implies ξ0 = 0, so the only weak accumulation point of
the π(at)ξ’s is 0. In other words w −limt→∞π(at)ξ = 0, which amounts to
the desired result.

Let us conclude by indicating how one can pass from SL2(R) to more
general semisimple groups, say SL3(R). Here

Claim: For each of these 3 copies of SL2(R), the restriction π|SL2(R) has no
non-zero ﬁxed vector.
Taking this claim for granted, we see (by the Howe-Moore theorem in the
case of SL2(R)) that π|SL2(R) is a C0-representation. Since A is generated by
its intersections with the three embeddings of SL2(R), we get for a ∈A:
lim
a→∞⟨π(a)ξ|η⟩= 0
i.e. π is C0.
Proof of the Claim: Assume that π|SL2(R) has a non-zero ﬁxed vector
ξ, say for the ﬁrst embedding of SL2(R). We are going to show that ξ is ﬁxed
under SL3(R).

We use the fact that SL3(R) is generated by elementary matrices Uij(t)
(t ∈R, i ̸= j). Let us show that ξ is U13(R)-invariant. Take u =

Then u ∈N +

enon (Proposition 3.3).

4 Margulis’ Super-rigidity Theorem
4.1 Statement
Recall that the real rank of a semisimple Lie group G, denoted by R−rk(G),
is the dimension of a maximal split torus in G. For example:
R −rk(SLn(R)) = n −1;
R −rk(SO(p, q)) = min{p, q}.
Theorem 4.1. (see [Mar91], Theorem 5.6) Take:
•
G, a connected, semisimple real algebraic group, with no compact factor,
and R −rk(G) ≥2;
•
Γ an irreducible lattice in G(R);
•
k a local ﬁeld of characteristic 0 (i.e. k = R, C or a ﬁnite extension of
Qp) and H a simple, connected, algebraic k-group.
Assume that π : Γ →H(k) is a homomorphism with Zariski dense image.
Then:
i) If k = R and H(R) is not compact, then π extends to a rational homo-
morphism G →H deﬁned over R (hence induces G(R) →H(R));
ii) If k = C, then either π(Γ) is compact, or π extends to a rational homo-
morphism G →H;
iii) If k is totally disconnected, then π(Γ) is compact.
4.2 Mostow Rigidity
One of the most spectacular applications of Theorem 4.1 is Mostow’s rigidity
theorem [Mos73].
Theorem 4.2. Let G, G′ be connected semi-simple Lie groups with trivial cen-
tre, no compact factors, and suppose Γ ⊂G, Γ ′ ⊂G′ are lattices. Assume Γ
irreducible in G and R−rk(G) ≥2. Let π : Γ →Γ ′ be an isomorphism. Then
π extends to an isomorphism G →G′.

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
253
In other words, the lattice determines the ambient Lie group.
Proof, from Theorem 4.1: For each simple factor H′
i of G′, ﬁnd a
structure of a simple real algebraic group such that H′
i = H′
i(R)o. By the Borel
density theorem [Bor60], Γ ′ is Zariski-dense in G′ = G′(R)o = %
i H′
i(R)o.
Similarly, write G = G(R)o. By Theorem 4.1 (case k = R), applied to each
factor H′
i, we may extend π to a rational homomorphism G →G′. Since π(G) is
an algebraic subgroup of G′, by Zariski-density we deduce π(G) = G′ and from
that: dimR π(G) = dimR G′, so π(G) = G′ by connectedness. Set N = Ker π.
Assume N ̸= {1}. Since G has no center, then dimR N > 0. Since Γ is an
irreducible lattice, the image of Γ is dense in G/N, which implies that π(Γ)
is dense in G′, contradicting discreteness of Γ ′.
□
We may rephrase the Mostow rigidity theorem as follows.
Let M, M ′ be locally symmetric Riemannian manifolds, with ﬁnite vol-
ume, irreducible (in the sense that neither M nor M ′ is locally a Riemannian
product), with rank ≥2. If π1(M) ≃π1(M ′), then M is isometric to M ′ (up
to a rescaling of metrics).
4.3 Ideas to Prove Super-rigidity, k = R
Lemma 4.1. Suppose P ⊂G and L ⊂H are proper real algebraic subgroups,
and there exists a rational Γ-equivariant map φ : G/P →H/L deﬁned over R
(where Γ acts on H/L via π - explicitly: φ(γ.x) = π(γ).φ(x)). Then π extends
to a rational homomorphism G →H deﬁned over R.
□
Proof: Idea: look at the graph of π:
gr(π) = {(γ, π(γ)) : γ ∈Γ} ⊂G × H,
and show that the Zariski closure gr(π)
Z is the graph of a homomorphism.
1st step: The projection of gr(π)
Z on the ﬁrst factor G, is onto: this follows
from the Borel density theorem.
2nd step: We have to show that, if (g, h1), (g, h2) ∈gr(π)
Z, then h1 = h2.
For this, let R(G/P, H/L) be the set of all rational maps G/P →H/L.
Let G × H act on R(G/P, H/L) by
((g, h).ψ)(x) = h.ψ(g−1x)
(ψ ∈R(G/P, H/L)). By assumption, our φ is Γ-equivariant. In terms of the
G × H-action, this means that φ is gr(π)-invariant. Since φ is rational, this
implies that φ is gr(π)
Z-invariant. In particular, for every x ∈G/P:
h1.φ(g−1x) = h2.φ(g−1x)
i.e. h−1
1 h2 ﬁxes φ(G/P) pointwise.

254
A. Valette
On the other hand, π(Γ) stabilizes φ(G/P), so π(Γ) also stabilizes
φ(G/P)
Z. By Zariski density of π(Γ), we deduce that H stabilizes φ(G/P)
Z.
Since H acts transitively on H/L, this implies that φ(G/P)
Z = H/L (i.e.
φ(G/P) is Zariski-dense in H/L).
As a consequence, h−1
1 h2 ﬁxes H/L pointwise, so h−1
1 h2 ∈8
h∈H hLh−1.
The latter is a proper normal subgroup of H. Since H is assumed to be simple,
this subgroup is {1}, i.e. h−1
1 h2 = 1. This concludes the proof.
□
We will apply this when P is a minimal parabolic subgroup of G, deﬁned
over R.

Set P0 = P ∩G(R)o. Then G(R)o/P0 is Zariski dense in the ﬂag variety
G/P. So, if we have a rational map φ : G/P →H/L deﬁned on a Zariski dense
subset of G(R)o/P0, which is Γ-equivariant as a map G(R)o/P0 →H/L, then
φ is Γ-equivariant.
It is therefore enough to ﬁnd a proper real algebraic subgroup L ⊂H and
a rational Γ-equivariant map G(R)o/P0 →H/L, deﬁned on a Zariski-dense
subset of G(R)o/P0. This will be done in two steps.
1st step: There is a proper real algebraic subgroup L ⊂H and a measur-
able Γ-equivariant map φ : G(R)o/P0 →H(R)/L(R).
2nd step: Any such measurable Γ-equivariant map agrees almost every-
where with a rational map.
We shall not elaborate on the second step, and refer instead to Chapter 5
in [Zim84]. Note however that it is here that R−rk(G) ≥2 is used! The proof
of the 1st step appeals to the following result of Furstenberg (Theorem 15.1
in [Fur73]), which will be proved in the next subsection.
Recall that, for a compact space X, we denote by M(X) the set of prob-
ability measures on X.
Proposition 4.1. Let X be a compact, metrizable Γ-space. There exists a
measurable Γ-equivariant map ω : G/P →M(X), i.e. ω(γx) = γω(x) for all
γ ∈Γ and almost all x ∈G/P.
Proof of the 1st step above: Let Q be a proper parabolic subgroup of
H, deﬁned over R. Then X = H(R)/Q(R) is a compact metrizable Γ-space.

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
255
By Proposition 4.1, we ﬁnd ω : G/P →M(X) measurable and Γ-equivariant.
We then argue as follows:
•
the orbit space H(R)\M(X) is countably separated (this is a result of
Zimmer [Zim78]);
•
Let ω : G/P →H(R)\M(X) be the composition of ω with the quotient
map M(X) →H(R)\M(X). Then ω(γx) = ω(x) a.e. in x ∈G/P. By
Moore’s ergodicity theorem 3.2, Γ acts ergodically on G/P. By Proposition
3.1, the map ω is almost everywhere constant on G/P. This means that
ω takes values essentially in a unique orbit H(R)µ0 ∈M(X).
•
For every µ ∈M(X), the stabilizer of µ in H(R) is the set of real points of a
proper, real algebraic subgroup of H. This is another result of Furstenberg
[Fur63].
Set then L = StabH(µ0). The map H(R)µ0 →H(R)/L(R) is H(R)-
equivariant. Composing, we get a Γ-equivariant measurable map φ : G/P →
H(R)/L(R), deﬁned on a Γ-invariant co-null set.
□
4.4 Proof of Furstenberg’s Proposition 4.1 - Use of Amenability
We give Margulis’ proof (see Theorem 4.5 in [Mar91]).
Denote by dg the Haar measure on G. Let Γ × G act on G × X by
(γ, g)(h, x) = (γhg−1, γx).
The projection p : G×X →G is (Γ ×G)-equivariant. Let Q be the set of non-
negative Borel measures µ on G × X such that p∗(µ) = dg and (γ, 1)∗µ = µ
for every γ ∈Γ. We make 3 observations.
•
Q is non-empty. Indeed, ﬁx D a Borel fundamental domain for Γ on G:
for every g ∈G, there exists a unique γg ∈Γ such that g ∈γgD. Fix
x0 ∈X and deﬁne φ : G →G × X : g →(g, γgx0). Then (γ, 1)φ(g) =
(γg, γγgx0) = φ((γ, 1)g). So φ is measurable, Γ-equivariant, and p ◦φ =
IdG. So φ∗(dg) ∈Q.
•
Q is convex (clear) and compact in the weak-∗topology. Indeed, if (Kn)n≥1
is an increasing sequence of compact subsets of G such that G = ∞
n=1 Kn.
Since X is compact, so is Kn×X, and therefore elements in Q are uniformly
bounded on Kn × X, namely µ(Kn × X) ≤
7
Kn dg for µ ∈Q. So Q is
bounded; since it is also weak-∗closed, by Tychonov it is weak-∗compact.
•
Q is (Γ × G)-invariant. This is because (γ, h)∗(dg) = dg, since G is uni-
modular.
Since P is amenable, there exists τ ∈Q which is ({1} × P)-invariant, hence
also (Γ × P)-invariant, by deﬁnition. As p∗(τ) = dg, we may disintegrate τ
over G:
τ =

G
(δg ⊗νg) dg

256
A. Valette
where νg ∈M(X) and the ﬁeld g →νg is measurable, and unique up to
modiﬁcation on a null set. Now
(γ, p)∗(τ) =

G
(δγgp−1 ⊗γ∗νg) dg
(h = γgp−1)
=

G
(δh ⊗γ∗νγ−1hp) dh.
By uniqueness: νg = γ∗νγ−1gp for almost every g ∈G. In particular νgp = νg
for almost every g ∈G and every p ∈P. So we may deﬁne a measurable map
ω : G/P →M(X) : gP →νg
which is Γ-equivariant.
□
4.5 Margulis’ Arithmeticity Theorem
Recall that two subgroups H1, H2 in the same group, are commensurable if
their intersection H1 ∩H2 has ﬁnite index both in H1 and H2.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let G be a real, linear, semisimple Lie group with ﬁnite cen-
tre. A lattice Γ in G is arithmetic if there exists a semisimple algebraic
Q-group H and a surjective continuous homomorphism φ : H(R)0 →G, with
compact kernel, such that φ(H(Z) ∩H(R)0) is commensurable with Γ (here
H(R)0 is the connected component of identity in H(R)).
Example 4.2. Let Φ be a quadratic form in n + 1 variables, with signature
(n, 1), and coeﬃcients in a number ﬁeld k ⊂R. We denote by SOΦ the
special orthogonal group of Φ: this is a simple algebraic group deﬁned over k.
Set Γ = SOΦ(O), where O is the ring of integers of k.
a) Φ = x2
1 + . . . + x2
n −x2
n+1; here k = Q and H = SOΦ, so that Γ =
SO(n, 1)(Z) is a non-uniform arithmetic lattice in SOΦ(R) = SO(n, 1).
b) Φ = x2
1 + . . . + x2
n −
√
2x2
n+1; here k = Q(
√
2) and H = SOΦ × SOσ(Φ),
where σ is the non-trivial element of Gal(k/Q). Then Γ = SOΦ(Z[
√
2]) is
a uniform arithmetic lattice in SOΦ(R) ≃SO(n, 1).
c) Φ = x2
1 + . . . + x2
n −δx2
n+1 where δ > 0 is a root of a cubic irreducible
polynomial over Q, having two positive roots δ, δ′ and one negative root
δ′′. Here k = Q(δ); let σ, τ be the embeddings of k into R deﬁned by
σ(δ) = δ′ and τ(δ) = δ′′. Then H = SOΦ × SOσ(Φ) × SOτ(Φ) and Γ
is an irreducible, uniform, arithmetic lattice in SOΦ(R) × SOσ(Φ)(R) ≃
SO(n, 1) × SO(n, 1).
Margulis’arithmeticity theorem is another spectacular application of super-
rigidity (Theorem 4.1).

Amenability and Margulis Super-Rigidity
257
Theorem 4.3. (see Chapter IX in [Mar91]) Let G be a connected semisimple
Lie group with trivial centre, no compact factors, and R −rk(G) ≥2. Let
Γ ⊂G be an irreducible lattice. Then Γ is arithmetic.
□
Non-arithmetic lattices are known to exist in SO(n, 1) for every n ≥2
(Gromov-Piatetskii-Shapiro [GPS88]), and in SU(n, 1) for 1 ≤n ≤3 (Deligne-
Mostow [DM86]).
For other rank 1 groups, i.e. Sp(n, 1) and the exceptional group F4(−20),
super-rigidity and arithmeticity of lattices have been established by Corlette
[Cor92] and Gromov-Schoen [GS92].
For a wealth of material on arithmetic groups, see [Bor69] and [WM].
Added on proof: It was pointed out to me by Gabriela Asli Nesin that equal-
ity (1) in the proof of Theorem 2.2 only holds for f left uniformly continuous
and bounded, so that strictly speaking my proof is valid only for discrete
groups.
To treat the general case, one may proceed as follows. Say that a mean
m on L∞(G) is topologically left invariant if m(f ⋆φ) = m(φ) for every φ ∈
L∞(G), f ∈L1(G)1,+. Observe then that, for every such f and such φ, the
function f ⋆φ is left uniformly continuous and bounded. Fix f0 ∈L1(G)1,+.
With m an invariant mean on L∞(G), set ˜m(φ) =: m(f0 ⋆φ). Then ˜m is a
topological left invariant mean on L∞(G) (for this, see the proof of Theorem
G.3.1 in [BHV]). Replacing m by ˜m, one may then repeat the end of the proof
of Theorem 2.2.

1 Introduction
Much of what I will say depends on analogies between representation theory
and linear algebra, so let me begin by recalling some ideas from linear alge-
bra. One goal of linear algebra is to understand abstractly all possible linear
transformations T of a vector space V . The simplest example of a linear trans-
formation is multiplication by a scalar on a one-dimensional space. Spectral
theory seeks to build more general transformations from this example. In the
case of inﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces, it is useful and interesting to intro-
duce a topology on V , and to require that T be continuous. It often happens

(as in the case when T is a diﬀerential operator acting on a space of functions)
that there are many possible choices of V , and that choosing the right one for
a particular problem can be subtle and important.
One goal of representation theory is to understand abstractly all the possi-
ble ways that a group G can act by linear transformations on a vector space V .
Exactly what this means depends on the context. For topological groups (like
Lie groups), one is typically interested in continuous actions on topological
vector spaces. Using ideas from the spectral theory of linear operators, it is
sometimes possible (at least in nice cases) to build such representations from
irreducible representations, which play the role of scalar operators on one-
dimensional spaces in linear algebra. Here is a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Suppose G is a topological group. A representation of G is
a pair (π, V ) with V a complete locally convex topological vector space, and
π a homomorphism from G to the group of invertible linear transformations
of V . We assume that the map
G × V →V,
(g, v) →π(g)v
is continuous.
An invariant subspace for π is a closed subspace W ⊂V with the property
that π(g)W ⊂W for all g ∈G. The representation is said to be irreducible if
there are exactly two invariant subspaces (namely V and 0).
The ﬂexibility in this deﬁnition—the fact that one does not require V to be
a Hilbert space, or the operators π(g) to be unitary—is a very powerful tech-
nical tool, even if one is ultimately interested only in unitary representations.
Here is one reason. There are several important classes of groups (includ-
ing reductive Lie groups) for which the classiﬁcation of irreducible unitary
representations is still an open problem. One way to approach the problem
(originating in the work of Harish-Chandra, and made precise by Knapp and
Zuckerman in [KZ77]) is to work with a larger class of “admissible” irreducible
representations, for which a classiﬁcation is available. The problem is then to
identify the (unknown) unitary representations among the (known) admissible
representations. Here is a formal statement.
Problem 1.2. Given an irreducible representation (π, V ), is it possible to
impose on V a Hilbert space structure making π a unitary representation?
Roughly speaking, this question ought to have two parts.
(1.2)(A)
Does V carry a G-invariant Hermitian bilinear form ⟨, ⟩π?
Assuming that such a form exists, the second part is this.
(1.2)(B)
Is the form ⟨, ⟩π positive deﬁnite?

The goal of these notes is to look at some diﬃculties that arise when one
tries to make this program precise, and to consider a possible path around
them. The diﬃculties have their origin exactly in the ﬂexibility of Deﬁni-
tion 1.1. Typically we want to realize a representation of G on a space of
functions. If G acts on a set X, then G acts on functions on X, by
[π(g)f](x) = f(g−1 · x).
The diﬃculty arises when we try to decide exactly which space of functions
on X to consider. If G is a Lie group acting smoothly on a manifold X, then
one can consider
C(X) = continuous functions on X,
Cc(X) = continuous functions with compact support,
C∞
c (X) = compactly supported smooth functions.
C−∞(X) = distributions on X.
If there is a reasonable measure on X, then one gets various Banach spaces
like Lp(X) (for 1 ⩽p < ∞), and Sobolev spaces. Often one can impose
various other kinds of growth conditions at inﬁnity. All of these construc-
tions give topological vector spaces of functions on X, and many of these
spaces carry continuous representations of G. These representations will not
be “equivalent” in any simple sense (involving isomorphisms of topological
vector spaces); but to have a chance of getting a reasonable classiﬁcation
theorem for representations, one needs to identify them.
When G is a reductive Lie group, Harish-Chandra found a notion of “in-
ﬁnitesimal equivalence” that addresses these issues perfectly. Inside every
irreducible representation V is a natural dense subspace VK, carrying an irre-
ducible representation of the Lie algebra of G. (Actually one needs for this an
additional mild assumption on V , called “admissibility.”) Inﬁnitesimal equiv-
alence of V and W means algebraic equivalence of VK and WK as Lie algebra
representations. (Some details appear in section 4.)
Deﬁnition 1.3. Suppose G is a reductive Lie group. The admissible dual of
G is the set G of inﬁnitesimal equivalence classes of irreducible admissible rep-
resentations of G. The unitary dual of G is the set Gu of unitary equivalence
classes of irreducible unitary representations of G.
Harish-Chandra proved that each inﬁnitesimal equivalence class of admis-
sible irreducible representations contains at most one unitary equivalence class
of irreducible unitary representations. That is,
(1.4)
Gu ⊂G.
This sounds like great news for the program described in Problem 1.2. Even
better, he showed that the representation (π, V ) is inﬁnitesimally unitary

262
David A. Vogan, Jr
if and only if the Lie algebra representation VK admits a positive-deﬁnite
invariant Hermitian form ⟨, ⟩π,K.
The diﬃculty is this. Existence of a continuous G-invariant Hermitian form
⟨, ⟩π on V implies the existence of ⟨, ⟩π,K on VK; but the converse is not true.
Since VK is dense in V , there is at most one continuous extension of ⟨, ⟩π,K to
V , but the extension may not exist. In section 3, we will look at some examples,
in order to understand why this is so. What the examples suggest, and what
we will see in section 4, is that the Hermitian form can be deﬁned only on
appropriately “small” representations in each inﬁnitesimal equivalence class.
In the example of the various function spaces on X, compactly supported
smooth functions are appropriately small, and will often carry an invariant
Hermitian form. Distributions, on the other hand, are generally too large a
space to admit an invariant Hermitian form.
Here is a precise statement. (We will write V ∗for the space of continuous
linear functionals on V , endowed with the strong topology (see section 8).)
Theorem 1.5. (Casselman, Wallach, and Schmid; see [Cas89], [Sch85], and
section 4). Suppose (π, V ) is an admissible irreducible representation of a re-
ductive Lie group G on a reﬂexive Banach space V . Deﬁne
(πω, V ω) = analytic vectors in V ,
(π∞, V ∞) = smooth vectors in V ,
(π−∞, V −∞) = distribution vectors in V = dual of (V ′)∞, and
(π−ω, V −ω) = hyperfunction vectors in V = dual of (V ′)ω.
Each of these four representations is a smooth representation of G in the
inﬁnitesimal equivalence class of π, and each depends only on that equivalence
class. The inclusions
V ω ⊂V ∞⊂V ⊂V −∞⊂V −ω
are continuous, with dense image.
Any invariant Hermitian form ⟨, ⟩K on VK extends uniquely to continuous
G-invariant Hermitian forms ⟨, ⟩ω and ⟨, ⟩∞on V ω and V ∞.
The assertions about Hermitian forms will be proven in Theorem 9.16.
The four representations appearing in Theorem 1.5 are called the minimal
globalization, the smooth globalization, the distribution globalization, and the
maximal globalization respectively. Unless π is ﬁnite-dimensional (so that all
of the spaces in the theorem are the same) the Hermitian form will not extend
continuously to the distribution or maximal globalizations V −∞and V −ω.
We will be concerned here mostly with representations of G constructed
using complex analysis, on spaces of holomorphic sections of vector bundles
and generalizations. In order to use these constructions to get unitary repre-
sentations, we need to do the analysis in such a way as to get the minimal or

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
263
smooth globalizations; this will ensure that the Hermitian forms we seek will
be deﬁned on the representations. A theorem of Hon-Wai Wong (see [Won99]
or Theorem 7.21 below) says that Dolbeault cohomology leads to the maximal
globalizations in great generality. This means that there is no possibility of
ﬁnding invariant Hermitian forms on these Dolbeault cohomology representa-
tions except in the ﬁnite-dimensional case.
We therefore need a way to modify the Dolbeault cohomology construction
to produce minimal globalizations rather than maximal ones. Essentially we
will follow ideas of Serre from [Ser55], arriving at realization of minimal glob-
alization representations ﬁrst obtained by Tim Bratten in [Bra97]. Because of
the duality used to deﬁne the maximal globalization, the question amounts to
this: how can one identify the topological dual space of a Dolbeault cohomol-
ogy space on a (noncompact) complex manifold? The question is interesting
in the simplest case. Suppose X ⊂C is an open set, and H(X) is the space
of holomorphic functions on X. Make H(X) into a topological vector space,
using the topology of uniform convergence of all derivatives on compact sets.
What is the dual space H(X)′?
This last question has a simple answer. Write C−∞
c
(X, densities) for the
space of compactly supported distributions on X. We can think of this as the
space of compactly supported complex 2-forms (or (1, 1)-forms) on X, with
generalized function coeﬃcients. (A brief review of these ideas will appear in
section 8). More generally, write
A(p,q),−∞
c
(X) =compactly supported (p, q)-forms
on X with generalized function coeﬃcients.
The Dolbeault diﬀerential ∂maps (p, q)-forms to (p, q+1) forms and preserves
support; so
∂: A(1,0),−∞
c
(X) →A(1,1),−∞
c
(X) = C−∞
c
(X, densities).
Then (see [Ser55], Th´eor`eme 3)
(1.6)
H(X)′ ≃A(1,1),−∞
c
(X)/∂A1,0
c (X).
Here the overline denotes closure. For X open in C the image of ∂is
automatically closed, so the overline is not needed; but this formulation has
an immediate extension to any complex manifold X (replacing 1 and 0 by the
dimension n and n −1). Here is Serre’s generalization.
Theorem 1.7. (Serre; see [Ser55], Th´eor`eme 2 or Theorem 8.13 below). Sup-
pose X is a complex manifold of dimension n, V is a holomorphic vector bundle
on X, and Ωis the canonical line bundle (of (n, 0)-forms on X). Deﬁne
A0,p(X, V) = smooth V-valued (0, p)-forms on X

264
David A. Vogan, Jr
A(0,p),−∞
c
(X, V) = compactly supported V-valued (0, p)-forms
with generalized function coeﬃcients.
Deﬁne the topological Dolbeault cohomology of X with values in V as
H0,p
top(X, V) = [kernel of ∂on A0,p(X, V)]/∂Ap−1,0(X, V);
this is a quotient of the usual Dolbeault cohomology. It carries a natural locally
convex topology. Similarly, deﬁne
H0,p
c,top(X, V) = [kernel of ∂on A(0,p),−∞
c
(X, V)]/∂A(p−1,0),−∞
c
(X, V),
the topological Dolbeault cohomology with compact supports. Then there is a
natural identiﬁcation
H0,p
top(X, L)∗≃H0,n−p
c,top (X, Ω⊗L∗).
Here L∗is the dual holomorphic vector bundle to L.
When X is compact, then the subscript c adds nothing, and the ∂opera-
tors automatically have closed range. One gets in that case the most familiar
version of Serre duality.
In Corollary 8.14 we will describe how to use this theorem to obtain Brat-
ten’s result, constructing minimal globalization representations on Dolbeault
cohomology with compact supports.
Our original goal was to understand invariant bilinear forms on minimal
globalization representations. Once the minimal globalizations have been iden-
tiﬁed geometrically, we can at least oﬀer a language for discussing this problem
using standard functional analysis. This is the subject of section 9.
There are around the world a number of people who understand analysis
better than I do. As an algebraist, I cannot hope to estimate this number.
Nevertheless I am very grateful to several of them (including Henryk Hecht,
Sigurdur Helgason, David Jerison, and Les Saper) who helped me patiently
with very elementary questions. I am especially grateful to Tim Bratten, for
whose work these notes are intended to be an advertisement. For the errors
that remain, I apologize to these friends and to the reader.
2 Compact Groups and the Borel-Weil Theorem
The goal of these notes is to describe a geometric framework for some basic
questions in representation theory for noncompact reductive Lie groups. In
order to explain what that might mean, I will recall in this section the sim-
plest example: the Borel-Weil theorem describing irreducible representations
of a compact group. Throughout this section, therefore, we ﬁx a compact
connected Lie group K, and a maximal torus T ⊂K. (We will describe an

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
265
example in a moment.) We ﬁx also a K-invariant complex structure on the
homogeneous space K/T. In terms of the structure theory of Lie algebras, this
amounts to a choice of positive roots for the Cartan subalgebra t = Lie(T)C
inside the complex reductive Lie algebra k = Lie(K)C. For more complete
expositions of the material in this section, we refer to [Kna86], section V.7, or
[Hel94], section VI.4.3, or [Vog87], chapter 1.
Deﬁne
(2.1)(a)
T = lattice of characters of T;
these are the irreducible representations of T. Each µ ∈T may be regarded as
a homomorphism of T into the unit circle, or as a representation (µ, Cµ) of T.
Such a representation gives rise to a K-equivariant holomorphic line bundle
(2.1)(b)
Lµ →K/T.
Elements of T are often called weights.
I do not want to recall the structure theory for K in detail, and most of
what I say will make some sense without the details. With that warning not
to pay attention, ﬁx a simple root α of T in K, and construct a corresponding
three-dimensional subgroup
(2.2)(a)
φα : SU(2) →K,
Kα = φα(SU(2)),
Tα = Kα ∩T.
Then Kα/Tα is the Riemann sphere CP1, and we have a natural holomorphic
embedding
(2.2)(b)
CP1 ≃Kα/Tα  →K/T.
The weight µ ∈T is called antidominant if for every simple root α,
(2.2)(c)
Lµ|Kα/Tα has non-zero holomorphic sections.
This is a condition on CP1, about which we know a great deal. The sheaf
of germs of holomorphic sections of Lµ|Kα/Tα is O(−⟨µ, α∨⟩); here α∨is the
coroot for the simple root α, and ⟨µ, α∨⟩is an integer. The sheaf O(n) on CP1
has non-zero sections if and only if n ⩾0. It follows that µ is antidominant if
and only if for every simple root α,
(2.2)(d)
⟨µ, α∨⟩⩽0.
Theorem 2.3. (Borel-Weil, Harish-Chandra; see [HC56], [Ser59]). Suppose
K is a compact connected Lie group with maximal torus T; use the notation
of (2.1) and (2.2) above.
(1) Every K-equivariant holomorphic line bundle on K/T is equivalent to Lµ,
for a unique weight µ ∈T.

266
David A. Vogan, Jr
(2) The line bundle Lµ has non-zero holomorphic sections if and only if µ is
antidominant.
(3) If µ is antidominant, then the space Γ(Lµ) of holomorphic sections is an
irreducible representation of K.
(4) This correspondence deﬁnes a bijection from antidominant characters of
T onto K.
As the references indicate, I believe that this theorem is due independently
to Harish-Chandra and to Borel and Weil. Nevertheless I will follow standard
practice and refer to it as the Borel-Weil theorem.
Before saying anything about a proof, we look at an example. Set
K = U(n) = n × n complex unitary matrices
(2.4)(a)
= {u = (u1, . . . , un) | ui ∈Cn, ⟨ui, uj⟩= δi,j} .
Here we regard Cn as consisting of column vectors, so that the ui are the
columns of the matrix u; δi,j is the Kronecker delta. This identiﬁes U(n) with
the set of orthonormal bases of Cn. As a maximal torus, we choose
T = U(1)n = diagonal unitary matrices

As a basis for the lattice of characters of T, we can choose
(2.4)(c)
χj
⎛
⎜
⎝
eiφ1

⎞
⎟
⎠= eiφj,
the action of T on the jth coordinate of Cn.
We want to understand the homogeneous space K/T = U(n)/U(1)n. Re-
call that a complete ﬂag in Cn is a collection of linear subspaces
(2.5)(a)
F = (0 = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fn = Cn),
dim Fj = j.
The collection of all such complete ﬂags is a complex projective algebraic
variety
(2.5)(b)
X = complete ﬂags in Cn,
of complex dimension n(n −1)/2. (When we need to be more precise, we may
write XGL(n).) We claim that
(2.5)(c)
U(n)/U(1)n ≃X.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
267
The map from left to right is
(2.5)(d)
(u1, . . . , un)U(1)n →F = (Fj),
Fj = span(u1, . . . , uj).
Right multiplication by a diagonal matrix replaces each column of u by a
scalar multiple of itself; so the spans in this deﬁnition are unchanged, and
the map is well-deﬁned on cosets. For the map in the opposite direction, we
choose an orthonormal basis u1 of the one-dimensional space F1; extend it
by Gram-Schmidt to an orthonormal basis (u1, u2) of F2; and so on. Each
uj is determined uniquely up to multiplication by a scalar eiφj, so the coset
(u1, . . . , un)U(1)n is determined by F.
It is often useful to notice that the full general linear group KC = GL(n, C)
(the complexiﬁcation of U(n)) acts holomorphically on X. For this action the
isotropy group at the base point is the Borel subgroup BC of upper triangular
matrices:
X = KC/BC.
The fact that X is also homogeneous for the subgroup K corresponds to the
group-theoretic facts
KC = KBC,
K ∩BC = T.
Now the deﬁnition of X provides a number of natural line bundles on X.
For 1 ⩽j ⩽n, there is a line bundle Lj whose ﬁber at the ﬂag F is the
one-dimensional space Fj/Fj−1:
(2.6)(a)
Lj(F) = Fj/Fj−1
(F ∈X).
This is a U(n)-equivariant (in fact KC-equivariant) holomorphic line bundle.
For any µ = (m1, . . . , mn) ∈Zn, we get a line bundle
(2.6)(b)
Lµ = Lm1
1
⊗· · · ⊗Lmn
n
For example, if p ⩽q, and F is any ﬂag, then Fq/Fp is a vector space of
dimension q −p. These vector spaces form a holomorphic vector bundle Vq,p.
Its top exterior power 5q−p Vq,p is therefore a line bundle on X. Writing
(2.6)(c)
µq,p = (0, . . . , 0
@ AB C
p terms
, 1, . . . , 1
@ AB C
q −p terms
, 0, . . . , 0
@ AB C
n −q terms
),
we ﬁnd
(2.6)(d)
Lµq,p ≃
6q−p
Vq,p.
One reason for making all these explicit examples is that it shows how
some of these bundles can have holomorphic sections. The easiest example is
Ln, whose ﬁber at F is the quotient space Cn/Fn−1. Any element v ∈Cn
deﬁnes a section σv of Ln, by the formula

268
David A. Vogan, Jr
(2.6)(e)
σv(F) = v + Fn−1 ∈Cn/Fn−1 = Ln(F).
Notice that this works only for Ln, and not for the other Lj. In a similar way,
taking q = n in (2.6)(c), we ﬁnd that any element ω ∈5n−p Cn deﬁnes a
section σω of Lµq,p, by
σω(F) = ω ∈
6n−p
(Cn/Fp).
By multiplying such sections together, we can ﬁnd non-zero holomorphic sec-
tions of any of the bundles Lµ, as long as
(2.6)(e)
0 ⩽m1 ⩽· · · ⩽mn.
In case m1 = · · · = mn = m, the sections we get are related to the
function detm on K (or KC). Since that function vanishes nowhere on the
group, its inverse provides holomorphic sections of the bundle corresponding
to (−m, · · · , −m). Multiplying by these, we ﬁnally have non-zero sections of
Lµ whenever
(2.6)(f)
m1 ⩽· · · ⩽mn.
Here is what the Borel-Weil theorem says for U(n).
Theorem 2.7. (Borel-Weil, Harish-Chandra). Use the notation of (2.4)–
(2.6).
(1) Every U(n)-equivariant holomorphic line bundle on the complete ﬂag man-
ifold X is equivalent to Lµ = Lm1
1
⊗· · · ⊗Lmn
n , for a unique
µ = (m1, . . . , mn) ∈Zn.
(2) The line bundle Lµ has non-zero holomorphic sections if and only if µ is
antidominant, meaning that
m1 ⩽· · · ⩽mn.
(3) If µ is antidominant, then the space Γ(Lµ) of holomorphic sections is an
irreducible representation of U(n).
(4) This correspondence deﬁnes a bijection from increasing sequences of inte-
gers onto 
U(n).
Here are some remarks about proofs for Theorems 2.3 and 2.7. Part (1)
is very easy: making anything G-equivariant on a homogeneous space G/H
is the same as making something H-equivariant. (Getting precise theorems
of this form is simply a matter of appropriately specifying “anything” and
“something,” then following your nose.)
For part (2), “only if” is easy to prove using reduction to CP1: if µ fails to
be antidominant, then there will not even be sections on some of those pro-
jective lines. The “if” part is more subtle. We proved it for U(n) in (2.6)(f),

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
269
essentially by making use of a large supply of known representations of U(n)
(the exterior powers of the standard representation, the powers of the deter-
minant character, and tensor products of these). For general K, one can do
something similar: once one knows the existence of a representation of lowest
weight µ, it is a simple matter to use matrix coeﬃcients of that representation
to construct holomorphic sections of Lµ. This is what Harish-Chandra did.
I cannot tell from the account in [Ser59] exactly what argument Borel and
Weil had in mind. In any case it is certainly possible to construct holomorphic
sections of Lµ (for antidominant µ) directly, using the Bruhat decomposition
of K/T. It is easy to write a holomorphic section on the open cell (for any
µ); then one can use the antidominance condition to prove that this section
extends to all of K/T.
Part (3) and the injectivity in part (4) are both assertions about the space
of intertwining operators
HomK(Γ(Lµ1), Γ(Lµ2)).
We will look at such spaces in more generality in section 9 (Corollary 9.13).
Finally, the surjectivity in part (4) follows from the existence of lowest
weights for arbitrary irreducible representations. This existence is a fairly
easy part of algebraic representation theory. I do not know of a purely complex
analysis proof.
Before we abandon compact groups entirely, here are a few comments
about how to generalize the linear algebra in (2.4)–(2.6). A classical compact
group is (in the narrowest possible deﬁnition) one of the groups U(n), O(n)
(of real orthogonal matrices), or Sp(2n) (of complex unitary matrices also
preserving a standard symplectic form on C2n). For each of these groups, there
is a parallel description of K/T as a projective variety of certain complete ﬂags
in a complex vector space. One must impose on the ﬂags certain additional
conditions involving the bilinear form that deﬁnes the group. Here are some
details.
Suppose ﬁrst that K = O(n), the group of linear transformations of Rn
preserving the standard symmetric bilinear form
B(x, y) =
n

j=1
xjyj
(x, y ∈Rn).
This form extends holomorphically to Cn, where it deﬁnes the group
(2.8)(a)
KC = O(n, C).
If W ⊂Cn is a p-dimensional subspace, then
W ⊥= {y ∈Cn | B(x, y) = 0, all x ∈W}
is a subspace of dimension n −p. We now deﬁne the complete ﬂag variety for
O(n) to be

270
David A. Vogan, Jr
(2.8)(b)
X = XO(n) = {F = (Fj) complete ﬂags | F ⊥
p = Fn−p,
0 ⩽p ⩽n}.
Notice that this deﬁnition forces the subspaces Fq with 2q ⩽n to satisfy
F ⊥
q ⊂Fq; that is, the bilinear form must vanish on these Fq. Such a subspace
is called isotropic. Knowledge of the isotropic subspaces Fq (for q ⩽n/2)
determines the remaining subspaces, by the requirement Fn−q = F ⊥
q . We get
an identiﬁcation
XO(n) ≃chains of isotropic subspaces (Fq) = (F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ),
(2.8)(c)
with dim Fq = q for all q ⩽n/2.
The orthogonal group is
(2.8)(d)
O(n) = {v = (v1, . . . , vn)|vp ∈Rn, B(vp, vq) = δp,q},
the set of orthonormal bases of Rn. As a maximal torus T in K, we can take
SO(2)[n/2], embedded in an obvious way. We claim that
(2.8)(e)
O(n)/SO(2)[n/2] ≃XO(n).
The map from left to right is
(2.8)(f)
(v1, . . . , vn)SO(2)n →F = (Fp),
Fp = span(v1 + iv2, . . . , v2p−1 + iv2p).
We leave to the reader the veriﬁcation that this is a well-deﬁned bijection, and
an extension of the ideas in (2.6) to this setting. (Notice only that O(n) is not
connected, that correspondingly X has two connected components, and that
the irreducibility assertion in Theorem 2.3(3) can fail.) The space X is also
homogeneous for the (disconnected) reductive algebraic group KC = O(n, C),
the isotropy group being a Borel subgroup of the identity component.
Finally, consider the standard symplectic form on C2n,
ω(x, y) =
n

p=1
xpyn+p −xn+pyp.
The group of linear transformations preserving this form is
(2.9)(a)
KC = Sp(2n, C);
the corresponding compact group may be taken to be
K = KC ∩U(2n).
(Often it is easier to think of K as a group of n × n matrices with entries
in the quaternions. This point of view complicates slightly the picture of KC,
and so I will not adopt it.) Just as for the symmetric form B, we can deﬁne

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
271
W ⊥= {y ∈C2n | ω(x, y) = 0, all x ∈W};
if W has dimension p, then W ⊥has dimension 2n −p. The complete ﬂag
variety for Sp(n) is
(2.9)(b)
X = XSp(2n) = {F = (Fj) complete ﬂags | F ⊥
p = F2n−p,
0 ⩽p ⩽2n}.
Again the deﬁnition forces Fq to be isotropic for q ⩽n, and we can identify
X ≃chains of isotropic subspaces (Fq) = (F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ),
(2.9)(c)
with dim Fq = q for all q ⩽n.
The complex symplectic group KC = Sp(2n, C) acts holomorphically on the
projective variety X.
The complex symplectic group is
(2.9)(d)
Sp(2n, C) = {v = (v1, . . . , v2n) | vp ∈C2n, ω(vp, vq) = δp,q−n
(p ⩽q)},
This identiﬁes KC with the collection of standard symplectic bases for C2n.
The compact symplectic group is identiﬁed with standard symplectic bases
that are also orthonormal for the standard Hermitian form ⟨, ⟩on C2n:
(2.9)(e)
Sp(2n) = {(v1, . . . , v2n) | vp ∈C2n, ω(vp, vq) = δp,q−n,
⟨vp, vq⟩= δp,q
(p ⩽q)},

3 Examples for SL(2, R)
In this section we will present some examples of representations of SL(2, R),
in order to develop some feeling about what inﬁnitesimal equivalence, minimal
globalizations, and so on look like in examples. More details can be found in
[Kna86], pages 35–41.
In fact it is a little simpler for these examples to consider not SL(2, R)
but the isomorphic group
(3.1)(a)
G = SU(1, 1) =
α β
β α

| α, β ∈C, |α|2 −|β|2 = 1

.
This is the group of linear transformations of C2 preserving the standard
Hermitian form of signature (1, 1), and having determinant 1. We will be
particularly interested in a maximal compact subgroup:
(3.1)(b)
K =

eiθ
0
0 e−iθ

| θ ∈R

.
The group G acts on the open unit disc by linear fractional transforma-
tions:
(3.2)(a)
α β
β α

· z = αz + β
βz + α.
It is not diﬃcult to check that this action is transitive:
(3.2)(b)
D = {z | |z| < 1} = G · 0 ≃G/K.
The last identiﬁcation comes from the fact that K is the isotropy group for
the action at the point 0.
The action of G on D preserves complex structures. Setting
(3.2)(c)
V −ω = holomorphic functions on D,
we therefore get a representation π of G on V −ω by
(3.2)(d)
[π(g)f](z) = f(g−1 · z) = f
 αz −β
−βz + α.

The representation (π, V −ω) is not irreducible, because the one-dimensional
closed subspace of constant functions is invariant. Nevertheless (as we will see
in section 4) the Casselman-Wallach-Schmid theory of distinguished global-
izations still applies. As the notation suggests, V −ω is a maximal globalization
for the corresponding Harish-Chandra module
(3.2)(e)
V K = polynomials in z

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
273
of K-ﬁnite vectors.
In order to describe other (smaller) globalizations of V K, we can control
the growth of functions near the boundary circle of D. The most drastic
possibility is to require the functions to extend holomorphically across the
boundary of D:
(3.3)(a)
V ω = holomorphic functions on D
This space can also be described as the intersection (over positive numbers
ϵ) of holomorphic functions on discs of radius 1 + ϵ. Restriction to the unit
circle identiﬁes V ω with real analytic functions on the circle whose negative
Fourier coeﬃcients all vanish. There is a natural topology on V ω, making it
a representation of G by the action π of (3.2)(d). As the notation indicates,
this representation is Schmid’s minimal globalization of V K.
A slightly larger space is
(3.3)(b) V ∞= holomorphic functions on D with smooth boundary values.
More or less by deﬁnition, V ∞can be identiﬁed with smooth functions on the
circle whose negative Fourier coeﬃcients vanish. The identiﬁcation topologizes
V ∞, and it turns out that the resulting representation of G is the Casselman-
Wallach smooth globalization of V K. Larger still is
(3.3)(c)
V (2) = holomorphic functions on D with L2 boundary values.
This is a Hilbert space, the square-integrable functions on the circle whose
negative Fourier coeﬃcients vanish. The representation of G on this Hilbert
space is continuous but not unitary (because these linear fractional transfor-
mations of the circle do not preserve the measure). Of course there are many
other function spaces on the circle that can be used in a similar way; I will
mention only
(3.3)(d)
V −∞= holomorphic functions on D with distribution boundary values.
This is the Casselman-Wallach distribution globalization of V K.
We therefore have
V ω ⊂V ∞⊂V (2) ⊂V −∞⊂V −ω.
These inclusions of representations are continuous with dense image. Holo-
morphic functions on the disc all have Taylor expansions
f(z) =
∞

We can describe each space by conditions on the coeﬃcients an; these descrip-
tions implicitly specify the topologies very nicely.

4 Harish-Chandra Modules and Globalization
In this section we will recall very brieﬂy some general facts about represen-
tations of real reductive groups. The ﬁrst problem is to specify what groups
we are talking about. A Lie algebra (over any ﬁeld of characteristic zero)
is called semisimple if it is a direct sum of non-abelian simple Lie algebras.
It is natural to deﬁne a real Lie group to be semisimple if it is connected,
and its Lie algebra is semisimple. Such a deﬁnition still allows some techni-
cally annoying examples (like the universal cover of SL(2, R), which has no
non-trivial compact subgroups). Accordingly there is a long tradition of work-
ing with connected semisimple groups having ﬁnite center. There are several
diﬃculties with that. As we will see, there are many results relating the rep-
resentation theory of G to representation theory of subgroups of G; and the
relevant subgroups are rarely themselves connected and semisimple. Another
diﬃculty comes from the demands of applications. One of the most important
applications of representation theory for Lie groups is to automorphic forms.
In that setting the most fundamental example is GL(n, R), a group which is
neither connected nor semisimple.
Most of these objections can be addressed by working with algebraic
groups, and considering always the group of real points of a connected re-
ductive algebraic group deﬁned over R. (The group GL(n) is a connected
algebraic group, even though its group of real points is disconnected as a Lie
group.) The diﬃculty with this is that it still omits some extremely important
examples. Some of the most interesting representation theory lives on the non-
linear double cover Mp(2n, R) of the algebraic group Sp(2n, R) (consisting of
linear transformations of R2n preserving a certain symplectic form). The “os-
cillator representation” of this group is fundamental to mathematical physics,
to the theory of automorphic forms, and to classical harmonic analysis. (Such
an assertion needs to be substantiated, and I won’t do that; but here at least
are some interesting references: [Wei64], [How88], [How89].)
So we want to include at least ﬁnite covering groups of real points of
connected reductive algebraic groups. At some point making a deﬁnition along

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
275
these lines becomes quite cumbersome. I will therefore follow the path taken
by Knapp in [Kna86], and take as the deﬁnition of reductive a property that
usually appears as a basic structure theorem. The deﬁnition is elementary and
short, and it leads quickly to some fundamental facts about the groups. One
can object that it does not extend easily to groups over other local ﬁelds, but
for the purposes of these notes that will not be a problem.
The idea is that the most basic example of a reductive group is the group
GL(n, R) of invertible n × n real matrices. We will recall a simple structural
fact about GL(n) (the polar decomposition of Proposition 4.2 below). Then
we will deﬁne a reductive group to be (more or less) any subgroup of some
GL(n) that inherits the polar decomposition.
If g ∈G = GL(n, R), deﬁne
(4.1)(a)
θg = tg
−1
the inverse of the transpose of g. The map θ is an automorphism of order 2,
called the Cartan involution of GL(n). Write O(n) = GL(n)θ for the subgroup
of ﬁxed points of θ. This is the group of n × n real orthogonal matrices, the
orthogonal group. It is compact.
Write gl(n, R) = Lie(GL(n, R)) for the Lie algebra of GL(n) (the space
of all n × n real matrices). The automorphism θ of G diﬀerentiates to an
involutive automorphism of the Lie algebra, deﬁned by
(4.1)(b)
(dθ)(X) = −tX.
Notice that if X happens to be invertible, then (dθ)(X) and θ(X) are both
deﬁned, and they are not equal. Despite this potential for confusion, we will
follow tradition and abuse notation by writing simply θ for the diﬀerential of
θ. The −1-eigenspace of θ on the Lie algebra is
(4.1)(c)
p0 = n × n symmetric matrices.
Proposition 4.2. (Polar or Cartan decomposition for GL(n, R)). Suppose
G = GL(n, R), K = O(n), and p0 is the space of n × n symmetric matrices.
Then the map
O(n) × p0 →GL(n)
(k, X) →k exp(X)
is an analytic diﬀeomorphism of O(n) × p0 onto GL(n).
Deﬁnition 4.3. A linear reductive group is a subgroup G ⊂GL(n, R) such
that
(1) G is closed (and therefore G is a Lie group).
(2) G has ﬁnitely many connected components.
(3) G is preserved by the Cartan involution θ of GL(n, R) (cf. (4.1)(a)).

276
David A. Vogan, Jr
Of course the last requirement means simply that the transpose of each element
of G belongs again to G. The restriction of θ to G (which we still write as θ)
is called the Cartan involution of G. Deﬁne
K = G ∩O(n) = Gθ,
a compact subgroup of G. Write
g0 = Lie(G) ⊂gl(n, R).
Finally, deﬁne
s0 = symmetric matrices in g0,
the −1-eigenspace of θ.
Proposition 4.4. (Cartan decomposition for linear real reductive groups).
Suppose G ⊂GL(n, R) is a linear reductive group, K = G ∩O(n), and s0 is
the space of symmetric matrices in the Lie algebra of G. Then the map
K × s0 →G,
(k, X) →k exp(X)
is an analytic diﬀeomorphism of K × s0 onto G.
One immediate consequence of this proposition is that K is a maximal
compact subgroup of G; that is, that any subgroup of G properly containing
K must be noncompact.
Here is a result connecting this deﬁnition with a more traditional one.
Proposition 4.5. Suppose H is a reductive algebraic group deﬁned over R,
and π: H →GL(V) is a faithful representation deﬁned over R. Then we can
choose a basis of V = V(R) in such a way that the corresponding embedding
π: H(R) →GL(n, R)
has image a linear reductive group in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.3.
Conversely, suppose G is a linear reductive group in the sense of Deﬁnition
4.3. Then we can choose H and π as above in such a way that
π(H(R))0 = G0;
that is, these two groups have the same identity component.
Here at last is the main deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.6. A real reductive group is a Lie group G endowed with a
surjective homomorphism
π: G →G ⊂GL(n, R)

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
277
onto a linear reductive group, such that ker π is ﬁnite. Use the diﬀerential of
π to identify
g0 = Lie( G) ≃Lie(G) = g0 ⊂gl(n, R).
This identiﬁcation makes θ into an automorphism ˜θ of g0. Deﬁne
K = π−1(K) ⊂G,
a compact subgroup (since π has ﬁnite kernel). Finally, deﬁne
s0 = −1-eigenspace of ˜θ on g0.
In the next statement we will use tildes to distinguish elements of G and
the exponential map of G for clarity; this is also helpful in writing down the
(very easy) proof based on Proposition 4.5. But thereafter we will drop all the
tildes.
Proposition 4.7. (Cartan decomposition for real reductive groups). Suppose
G is a real reductive group as in Deﬁnition 4.6. Then the map
K × s0 →G,
(˜k, 
X) →˜k exp∼( 
X)
is an analytic diﬀeomorphism of K × s0 onto G. Deﬁne a diﬀeomorphism ˜θ
of G by
˜θ(˜k exp∼( 
X)) = ˜k exp∼(−
X).
Then ˜θ is an automorphism of order two, with ﬁxed point group K.
We turn now to the problem of exploiting this structure for understanding
representations of a reductive group G. Recall from Deﬁnition 1.1 the notion
of representation of G.
Deﬁnition 4.8. Suppose (π, V ) is a representation of G. A vector v ∈V is
said to be smooth (respectively analytic) if the map
G →V,
g →π(g) · v
is smooth (respectively analytic). Write V ∞(respectively V ω) for the space
of smooth (respectively analytic) vectors in V . When the group G is not clear
from context, we may write for example V ∞,G.
Each of V ∞and V ω is a G-stable subspace of V ; we write π∞and πω for
the corresponding actions of G. Each of these representations diﬀerentiates to
a representation dπ of the Lie algebra g0, and hence also of the enveloping
algebra U(g). (We will always write
(4.9)
g0 = Lie(G),
g = g0 ⊗R C,

278
David A. Vogan, Jr
and use analogous notation for other Lie groups.) Each of V ∞and V ω has a
natural complete locally convex topology, making the group representations
continuous. In the case of V ∞, this topology can be given by seminorms
v →ρ(dπ(u)v)
with ρ one of the seminorms deﬁning the topology of V , and u ∈U(g). Since
the enveloping algebra has countable dimension, it follows at once that V ∞is
Fr´echet (topologized by countably many seminorms) whenever V is Fr´echet.
The condition that the function π(g)v be real analytic may be expressed
in terms of the existence of bounds on derivatives of the function: that if
X1, X2, . . . , Xm is a basis of g0, and g0 ∈G, then there should exist ϵ > 0 and
a neighborhood U of g0 so that for any seminorm ρ on V ,
ρ(dπ(XI)π(g)v) ⩽CϵI! ϵ−|I|
for all multiindices I = (i1, . . . , im) and all g ∈U. Here we use standard
multiindex notation, so that
XI = Xi1
1 · · · Xim
m ,
|I| =
m

j=1
ij,
and so on. This description suggests how to deﬁne the topology on V ω as an
inductive limit (over open coverings of G, with positive numbers ϵ(U) attached
to each set in the cover).
It is a standard theorem (due to G˚arding, and true for any Lie group) that
V ∞is dense in V . I am not certain in what generality the density of V ω in
V is known; we will recall (in Theorem 4.13) Harish-Chandra’s proof of this
density in enough cases for our purposes.
One of Harish-Chandra’s fundamental ideas was the use of relatively easy
facts in the representation theory of compact groups to help in the study of
representations of G. Here are some basic deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 4.10. Suppose (π, V ) is a representation of a compact Lie group
K. A vector v ∈V is said to be K-ﬁnite if it belongs to a ﬁnite-dimensional
K-invariant subspace. Write V K for the space of all K-ﬁnite vectors in V .
Suppose (µ, Eµ) is an irreducible representation of K. (Then Eµ is neces-
sarily ﬁnite-dimensional, and carries a K-invariant Hilbert space structure.)
The µ-isotypic subspace V (µ) is the span of all copies of Eµ inside V .
Proposition 4.11. Suppose (π, V ) is a representation of a compact Lie group
K. Then
V K ⊂V ω,K ⊂V ∞,K ⊂V ;
V K is dense in V . There is an algebraic direct sum decomposition
V K =

µ∈
K
V (µ).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
279
Each subspace V (µ) is closed in V , and so inherits a locally convex topology.
There is a unique continuous operator
P(µ): V →V (µ)
commuting with K and acting as the identity on V (µ). For any v ∈V and
µ ∈K, we can therefore deﬁne
vµ = P(µ)v ∈V (µ).
If v ∈V ∞,K, then
v =

µ∈
K
vµ,
an absolutely convergent series.
Finally, deﬁne
V −K =

µ∈
K
V (µ),
the algebraic direct product. The operators P(µ) deﬁne an embedding
V  →V −K,
v →

vµ.
There are natural complete locally convex topologies on V K and V −K
making all the inclusions here continuous, but we will have no need of this.
Returning to the world of reductive groups, here is Harish-Chandra’s basic
deﬁnition. The deﬁnition will refer to
ZG(g) = Ad(G)-invariant elements of U(g).
If G is connected, this is just the center of the enveloping algebra. Schur’s
lemma suggests that ZG(g) ought to act by scalars on an irreducible repre-
sentation of G, but there is no general way to make this suggestion into a
theorem. (Soergel gave an example of an irreducible Banach representation of
SL(2, R) in which ZG(g) does not act by scalars.) Nevertheless the suggestion
is correct for most representations arising in applications, so Harish-Chandra
made it into a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.12. Suppose G is real reductive with maximal compact subgroup
K, and (π, V ) is a representation of G. We say that π is admissible if π has
ﬁnite length, and either of the following equivalent conditions is satisﬁed:
(1) for each µ ∈K, the isotypic space V (µ) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
(2) each v ∈V ∞is contained in a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace preserved by
dπ(ZG(g)).

280
David A. Vogan, Jr
The assumption of “ﬁnite length” means that V has a ﬁnite chain of closed
invariant subspaces in which successive quotients are irreducible. Harish-
Chandra actually called the ﬁrst condition “admissible” and the second “qua-
sisimple,” and he proved their equivalence. It is the term admissible that has
become standard now, perhaps because it carries over almost unchanged to
the setting of p-adic reductive groups. Harish-Chandra also proved that a
unitary representation of ﬁnite length is automatically admissible.
Theorem 4.13. (Harish-Chandra). Suppose (π, V ) is an admissible repre-
sentation of a real reductive group G with maximal compact subgroup K.
(1) V K ⊂V ω ⊂V ∞.
(2) The subspace V K is preserved by the representations of g and K.
(3) There is a bijection between the set
{closed G-stable subspaces W ⊂V }
and the set
(
arbitrary (g, K)-stable subspaces W K ⊂V K)
.
Here W corresponds to its subspace W K of K-ﬁnite vectors, and W K
corresponds to its closure W in V .
The structure carried by V K is fundamental, and has a name of its own.
Deﬁnition 4.14. Suppose G is a real reductive group with complexiﬁed Lie
algebra g and maximal compact subgroup K. A (g, K)-module is a vector space
X endowed with actions of g and of K, subject to the following conditions.
(1) Each vector in X belongs to a ﬁnite-dimensional K-stable subspace, on
which the action of K is continuous.
(2) The diﬀerential of the action of K (which exists by the ﬁrst condition) is
equal to the restriction of the action of g.
(3) The action map
g × X →X,
(Z, x) →Z · x
is equivariant for the actions of K. (Here K acts on g by Ad.)
Harish-Chandra’s Theorem 4.13 implies that if (π, V ) is an admissible ir-
reducible representation of G, then V K is an irreducible (g, K)-module. We
call V K the Harish-Chandra module of π. We say that two such representa-
tions (π, V ) and (ρ, W) are inﬁnitesimally equivalent if V K ≃W K as (g, K)-
modules.
Theorem 4.15. (Harish-Chandra). Every irreducible (g, K)-module arises as
the Harish-Chandra module of an irreducible admissible representation of G
on a Hilbert space.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
281
(Actually Harish-Chandra proved this theorem only for linear reductive
groups G. The general case was completed by Lepowsky.) In light of this
theorem and the preceding deﬁnitions, we deﬁne
Gadm = inﬁnitesimal equivalence classes of
irreducible admissible representations
= equivalence classes of irreducible (g, K)-modules.
A continuous group representation with Harish-Chandra module X is
called a globalization of X.
We ﬁx now a ﬁnite length (g, K)-module
(4.16)(a)
X =

µ∈
K
X(µ).
In addition, we ﬁx a Hilbert space globalization
(4.16)(b)
(πHilb, XHilb)
(For irreducible X, such a globalization is provided by Theorem 4.15. For X
of ﬁnite length, the existence of XHilb is due to Casselman.) For the purposes
of the theorems and deﬁnitions that follow, any reﬂexive Banach space glob-
alization will serve equally well; with minor modiﬁcations, one can work with
a reﬂexive Fr´echet representation of moderate growth (see [Cas89], Introduc-
tion). The Hilbert (or Banach) space structure restricts to a norm
(4.16)(c)
∥∥µ : X(µ) →R
We will need also the dual Harish-Chandra module
Xdual = K-ﬁnite vectors in the algebraic dual of X.
The contragredient representation of G on the dual space (XHilb)′, deﬁned by
(4.16)(d)
(πHilb)′(g) = t(πHilb(g−1))
has Harish-Chandra module Xdual. (We will discuss the transpose of a lin-
ear map and duality in general in more detail in section 8.) In particular,
(XHilb)′(µ) = X(µ)′ inherits the norm
(4.16)(e)
∥∥′
µ : X(µ) →R
from (XHilb)′. This is unfortunately not precisely the dual norm to ∥∥µ, but
the diﬀerence can be controlled1: there is a constant C ⩾1 so that
1 The diﬀerence is that the dual norm to ∥∥µ involves the size of a linear functional
only on elements of X(µ), whereas ∥∥′
µ involves the size of a linear functional on
the whole space. The second inequality in (4.16)(f) is obvious. The constant in
the ﬁrst inequality is an estimate for the norm of the projection operator P(µ)
from Proposition 4.11. The estimate comes from the standard formula for P(µ)
as an integral over K of π(k) against the character of µ.

A Hilbert space globalization is technically valuable in the subject, but it
has a very serious weakness: it is not canonically deﬁned, even up to a bounded
operator. More concretely, suppose that X happens to be unitary, so that there
is a canonical Hilbert space globalization XHilb∼(coming from the unitary
structure). The nature of the problem is that the inﬁnitesimal equivalence
of XHilb and XHilb∼need not be implemented by a bounded operator from
XHilb to XHilb∼. A consequence is that the invariant Hermitian form on X
giving rise to the unitary structure need not be deﬁned on all of XHilb: we
cannot hope to look for unitary structures by looking for Hermitian forms on
random Hilbert space globalizations. Here is the technical heart of the work
of Wallach, Casselman, and Schmid addressing this problem.
Theorem 4.17. (Casselman-Wallach; see [Cas89]). In the setting of (4.16),
the norm ∥∥µ is well-deﬁned up to a polynomial in |µ| (which means the length
of the highest weight of the representation µ of K): if ∥∥∼
µ is the collection
of norms arising from any other Hilbert (or reﬂexive Banach) globalization of
X, then there are a positive integer M and a constant CM so that
∥∥µ ⩽CM(1 + |µ|)M∥∥∼
µ .
The proof of this result given by Wallach and Casselman is quite compli-
cated and indirect; indeed it is not entirely easy even to extract the result from
their papers. It would certainly be interesting to ﬁnd a more direct approach:
beginning with the Harish-Chandra module X, to construct the various norms
∥∥µ (deﬁned up to inequalities like those in Theorem 4.17); and then to prove
directly that the topological vector spaces constructed in Theorems 4.18, 4.20
carry smooth representations of G. The ﬁrst step in this process (deﬁning the
norms) is perhaps not very diﬃcult. The second seems harder.
Theorem 4.18. (Casselman-Wallach; see [Cas89]). In the setting of (4.16),
the space of smooth vectors of XHilb is
XHilb,∞=
⎧
⎨
⎩

µ∈
K
xµ | xµ ∈X(µ), ∥xµ∥µ rapidly decreasing in |µ|
⎫
⎬
⎭.
Here “rapidly decreasing” means that for every positive integer M there is a
constant CN so that
∥xµ∥µ ⩽CN(1 + |µ|)−N.
The minimum possible choice of CN deﬁnes a seminorm; with these semi-
norms, XHilb,∞is a nuclear Fr´echet space.
Regarded as a collection of sequences of elements chosen from X(µ), the
space of smooth vectors and its topology are independent of the choice of the
globalization XHilb.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
283
Deﬁnition 4.19. Suppose that X is any Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite
length. The Casselman-Wallach smooth globalization of X is the space of
smooth vectors in any Hilbert space globalization of X. We use Theorem 4.18
to identify it as a space of sequences of elements of X, and denote it X∞.
There is a parallel description of analytic vectors.

analytic vectors of XHilb is

Here “exponentially decreasing” means that there are an ϵ > 0 and a constant
Cϵ so that
∥xµ∥µ ⩽Cϵ(1 + ϵ)−|µ|.
The minimum choice of Cϵ deﬁnes a Banach space structure on a subspace,
and XHilb,ω has the inductive limit topology, making it the dual of a nuclear
Fr´echet space.
Regarded as a collection of sequences of elements chosen from X(µ), the
space of analytic vectors and its topology are independent of the choice of the
globalization XHilb.
Deﬁnition 4.21. Suppose that X is any Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite
length. Schmid’s minimal or analytic globalization of X is the space of ana-
lytic vectors in any Hilbert space globalization of X. We use Theorem 4.18 to
identify it as a space of sequences of elements of X, and denote it Xω.
Finally, we will need the duals of these two constructions.
Deﬁnition 4.22. Suppose that X is any Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite
length. The Casselman-Wallach distribution globalization of X is the contin-
uous dual of the space of smooth vectors in any Hilbert space globalization
of Xdual. We can use Theorem 4.18 to identify it as a space of sequences of
elements of X, and denote it X−∞. Explicitly,
X−∞=

Here “slowly increasing” means that there is a positive integer N and a con-

∥xµ∥µ ⩽CN(1 + |µ|)N.
This exhibits X−∞as an inductive limit of Banach spaces, and the dual of
the nuclear Fr´echet space Xdual,∞.

Deﬁnition 4.23. Suppose that X is any Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite

of Xdual. We can use Theorem 4.19 to identify it as a space of sequences of

Here “less than exponentially increasing” means that for every ϵ > 0 there is
a constant Cϵ so that
∥xµ∥µ ⩽Cϵ(1 + ϵ)|µ|.
This exhibits X−ω as a nuclear Fr´echet space.
When we wish to emphasize the K-ﬁnite nature of X, we can write the
space as XK = 

Our various globalizations now appear as sequence spaces, with gradually
weakening conditions on the sequences:
(4.24)
XK ⊂Xω ⊂X∞⊂X−∞⊂X−ω ⊂X−K.
The conditions on the sequences are: almost all zero, exponentially decreasing,
rapidly decreasing, slowly increasing, less than exponentially increasing, and
no condition. All of the conditions are expressed in terms of the norms chosen
in (4.16), and the naturality of the deﬁnitions depends on Theorem 4.17. We
could also insert our Hilbert space XHilb in the middle of the list (between
X∞and X−∞), corresponding to sequences in ℓ2. I have not done this because
that sequence space does depend on the choice of XHilb.
Even the spaces XK and X−K carry natural complete locally convex
topologies (still given by the sequence structure); the representations of g and
K are continuous for these topologies. (The group G will not act on either of
them unless X is ﬁnite-dimensional.)
5 Real Parabolic Induction and the Globalization
Functors
In order to get some feeling for the various globalization functors deﬁned in
section 4, we are going to compute them in the setting of parabolically induced

representations. Logically this cannot be separated from the deﬁnition of the
functors: the proof by Wallach and Casselman of Theorem 4.15 proceeds by
embedding arbitrary representations in parabolically induced representations,
and computing there. But we will ignore these subtleties, taking the results
of section 4 as established.
Throughout this section, G will be a real reductive group with Cartan
involution θ and maximal compact subgroup K, as in Deﬁnition 4.6. We want
to construct representations using parabolic subgroups of G, so the ﬁrst prob-
lem is to say what a parabolic subgroup is. In part because of the possible
disconnectedness of G, there are several possible deﬁnitions. We want to take
advantage of the fact that the complexiﬁed Lie algebra g (cf. (4.9)) is a com-
plex reductive Lie algebra, for which lots of structure theory is available.
Deﬁnition 5.1. A real parabolic subgroup of the real reductive group G is
a Lie subgroup P ⊂G with the property that p = Lie(P)C is a parabolic
subalgebra of g. Write
u = nil radical of p;
because this is an ideal preserved by all automorphisms of p as a real Lie
algebra, it is the complexiﬁcation of an ideal u0 of p0. Let U be the connected
Lie subgroup of P with Lie algebra u0; it is a nilpotent Lie group, normal in P.
This is the most liberal possible deﬁnition of real parabolic subgroup. The
most restrictive would require in addition that P be the normalizer of p (under
the adjoint action) in G.
The quotient Lie algebra p/u is reductive, and is always represented by a
subalgebra (a Levi factor) of p. But the Levi factor is not unique, and picking a
good one is often a slightly delicate matter. In the present setting this problem
is solved for us. Because θ is an automorphism of G, θP is another parabolic
subgroup. Deﬁne
(5.2)
L = P ∩θP,
a θ-stable Lie subgroup of G.
Proposition 5.3. Suppose P is a parabolic subgroup of the real reductive
group G, and L = P ∩θP.
(1) The subgroups P, L, and U are all closed in G.
(2) Multiplication deﬁnes a diﬀeomorphism
L × U →P,
(l, u) →lu.
In particular, L ≃P/U.
(3) L is a reductive subgroup of G, with Cartan involution θ|L.
(4) The exponential map is a diﬀeomorphism from u0 onto U.

286
David A. Vogan, Jr
(5) Every element of G is a product (not uniquely) of an element of K and
an element of P: G = KP. Furthermore
P ∩K = L ∩K
is a maximal compact subgroup of L and of P. Consequently there are
diﬀeomorphisms of homogeneous spaces
G/P ≃K/L ∩K,
G/K ≃P/L ∩K.
The ﬁrst of these is K-equivariant, and the second P-equivariant.
(6) The map
K × (l0 ∩s0) × U →G,
(k, X, u) →k · exp(X) · u
is an analytic diﬀeomorphism.
The last assertion interpolates between the Iwasawa decomposition (the
case when P is a minimal parabolic subgroup) and the Cartan decomposition
(the case when P is all of G, or more generally when P is open in G). We saw
in section 2 (after 2.5) an example of the diﬀeomorphism in (5), with G =
GL(n, C), P the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices, and K = U(n).
In this case L is the group of diagonal matrices in GL(n, C), and L ∩K =
U(1)n.
How does one ﬁnd parabolic subgroups? The easiest examples are “block
upper-triangular” subgroups of GL(n, R). I will assume that if you’ve gotten
this far, those subgroups are more or less familiar, and look only at more
complicated reductive groups.
It’s better to ask instead how to ﬁnd the homogeneous spaces G/P, in
part because construction of representations by induction really takes place
on the whole homogeneous space and not just on the isotropy group P. A
good answer is that one begins with the corresponding homogeneous spaces
related to the complex Lie algebra g, and looks for appropriate orbits of G on
those spaces. We will give some more details about this approach in section
6; but here is one example.
Suppose p and q are non-negative integers, and n = p + q. The standard
Hermitian form of signature (p, q) on Cn is
⟨v, w⟩p,q =
p

j=1
vjwj −
q

k=1
vp+kwp+k.
The group G = U(p, q) of complex linear transformations preserving this form
is a real reductive group, with maximal compact subgroup
(5.4)(a)
K = U(p) × U(q).
The group G does not have obvious “block upper-triangular” subgroups; but
here is a way to make a parabolic. Fix a non-negative integer r ⩽p, q, and
deﬁne

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
287
(5.4)(b)
fj = ej + iep+j,
gj = ej −iep+j
(1 ⩽j ⩽r)
The subspace
Ir = span(f1, . . . , fr)
is an r-dimensional isotropic plane (for the form ⟨v, w⟩p,q), and so is its com-
plex conjugate
Ir = span(g1, . . . , gr).
Deﬁne
(5.4)(c)
Pr = stabilizer of Ir in U(p, q);
this will turn out to be a parabolic subgroup of U(p, q). One checks easily that
θPr = stabilizer of Ir in U(p, q).
Writing Cp,q for Cn endowed with the Hermitian form ⟨v, w⟩p,q, we ﬁnd a
natural vector space decomposition
Cp,q = Ir ⊕Ir ⊕Cp−r,q−r.
This decomposition provides an embedding
(5.4)(d)
GL(r, C) × U(p −r, q −r)  →U(p, q) :
a matrix g in GL(r, C) acts as usual on the basis {fj} of Ir, by tg−1 on the
basis {gj} of Ir, and trivially on Cp−r,q−r. Now it is easy to check that
(5.4)(e)
Lr = Pr ∩θPr = GL(r, C) × U(p −r, q −r).
(I will leave to the reader the problem of describing the group Ur explicitly.
As a hint, my calculations indicate
dim Ur = r(2[(p −r) + (q −r)] + r).
If my calculations are incorrect, please disregard this hint.)
The example shows that
(5.4)(f)
G/Pr ≃r-dimensional isotropic subspaces of Cp,q.
As r varies from 1 to min(p, q), we get in this way all the maximal proper par-
abolic subgroups of U(p, q). Smaller parabolic subgroups can be constructed
directly in similar ways, or by using the following general structural fact.
Proposition 5.5. Suppose G is a real reductive group and P = LU is a
parabolic subgroup. Suppose QL = MLNL is a parabolic subgroup of L. Then
Q = QLU = ML(NLU)
is a parabolic subgroup of G, with Levi factor ML and unipotent radical N =
NLU. This construction deﬁnes a bijection
parabolic subgroups of L ↔parabolic subgroups of G containing P.

288
David A. Vogan, Jr
If you believe that the Pr are all the maximal parabolics in U(p, q), and if
you know about parabolic subgroups of GL(r, C), then you see that the conju-
gacy classes of parabolic subgroups of U(p, q) are parametrized by sequences
(possibly empty) r = (r1, . . . , rs) of positive integers, with the property that
r =

rj ⩽min(p, q).
The Levi subgroup Lr of Pr is
Lr = GL(r1, C) × · · · × GL(rs, C) × U(p −r, q −r).
Parallel analyses can be made for all the classical groups (although the possi-
bilities for disconnectedness can become quite complicated).
We turn now to representation theory.
Deﬁnition 5.6. Suppose P = LU is a parabolic subgroup of the reductive
group G. A representation (τ, Y ) of P is called admissible if its restriction to
L is admissible (Deﬁnition 4.12). In this case the Harish-Chandra module of
Y is the (p, L ∩K)-module Y L∩K of L ∩K-ﬁnite vectors in Y .
The notation here stretches a bit beyond what was deﬁned in section 4,
but I hope that is not a serious problem. The easiest way to get admissible
representations of P is from admissible representations of L, using the isomor-
phism L ≃P/U. That is, we extend a representation of L to P by making U
act trivially. Any irreducible admissible representation of P is of this form. On
any admissible representation (τ, Y ) of P, the group U must act unipotently,
in the following strong sense: there is a ﬁnite chain
0 = Y0 ⊂Y1 ⊂· · · ⊂Ym = Y
of closed P-invariant subspaces, with the property that U acts trivially on
each subquotient Yi/Yi−1. One immediate consequence is that the action of
U is analytic on all of Y , so that (for example) the P-analytic vectors for Y
are the same as the L-analytic vectors.
The main reason for allowing representations of P on which U acts non-
trivially is for the Casselman-Wallach proof of Theorem 4.17. They show that
(for P minimal) any admissible representation of G can be embedded in a
representation induced from an admissible representation of P. This statement
is not true if one restricts to representations trivial on U.
So how do we pass from a representation of P to a representation of G?
Whenever G is a topological group, H a closed subgroup, and (τ, Y ) a repre-
sentation of H, the induced representation of G is deﬁned on a space like
(5.7)(a)
X = {f : G →Y | f(xh) = τ(h)−1f(x)
(x ∈G, h ∈H)}.
The group G acts on such functions by left translation:
(5.7)(b)
(π(g)f)(x) = f(g−1x).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
289
To make the deﬁnition precise, one has to decide exactly which functions to
use, and then to topologize X so as to make the representation continuous.
Depending on exactly what structures are available on G, H, and Y , there are
many possibilities: continuous functions, smooth functions, analytic functions,
measurable functions, integrable functions, distributions, and many more.
To be more precise in our setting, let us ﬁx
(5.8)(a)
Y L∩K = admissible (p, L ∩K)-module;
by “admissible” we mean that Y L∩K should have ﬁnite length as an (l, L∩K)-
module. The theory of globalizations in section 4 extends without diﬃculty
to cover admissible (p, L ∩K)-modules. This means ﬁrst of all that Y L∩K is
the Harish-Chandra module of an admissible Hilbert space representation
(5.8)(b)
(τ Hilb, Y Hilb).
Using this Hilbert space representation, we can construct the subrepresen-
tations of smooth and analytic vectors, and dually the distribution and hy-
perfunction vectors (duals of the smooth and analytic vectors in a Hilbert
globalization of Y L∩K,dual). In the end, just as in (4.24), we have
(5.8)(c)
Y L∩K ⊂Y ω ⊂Y ∞⊂Y Hilb ⊂Y −∞⊂Y −ω ⊂Y −L∩K.
These are complete locally convex topological vector spaces; the inclusions are
continuous with dense image. All but the ﬁrst and last carry irreducible rep-
resentations of P, which we denote τ ω, etc. When Y L∩K is ﬁnite-dimensional
(as is automatic for P minimal), all of these spaces are the same.
We now want to use these representations of P and the general idea of
(5.7) to construct representations of G. That is, we want to begin with one of
the representations Y of (5.8)(a), and deﬁne an appropriate space of functions
(5.9)(a)
X = {f : G →Y | f(xp) = τ(p)−1f(x)
(x ∈G, p ∈P}.
What we will use constantly is Proposition 5.3(5). This provides an identiﬁ-
cation
(5.9)(b)
X ≃{f : K →Y | f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k)
(k ∈K, l ∈L ∩K}.
The description of X in (5.9)(a) is called the “induced picture”; we may write
Xind to emphasize that. The description in (5.9)(b) is the “compact picture,”
and may be written Xcpt. The great advantage of the ﬁrst picture is that
the action of G (by left translation) is apparent. The great advantage of the
second is that many questions of analysis come down to the compact group K.
Eventually we will need to understand at least the action of the Lie algebra g
in the compact picture; a formula appears in (5.14)(d). For the moment, notice
that an element of Xind is continuous (respectively measurable) if and only if
the corresponding element of Xcpt is continuous (respectively measurable). If

290
David A. Vogan, Jr
the representation τ is smooth (respectively analytic), then the same is true
of smooth (respectively analytic) functions.
The classical setting for induction is unitary representations. In the setting
of (5.7), suppose Y is a Hilbert space, with Hilbert space norm ∥·∥Y preserved
by H. We will choose the space X in (5.7)(a) to consist of certain measurable
functions from G to Y . If f is such a function, then
(5.10)(a)
g →∥f(g)∥Y
is a non-negative real-valued measurable function on G. Because of the trans-
formation law on f imposed in (5.7)(a), this function is actually right-invariant
under H:
(5.10)(b)
∥f(gh)∥Y = ∥f(g)∥Y
(g ∈G, h ∈H)
We want to ﬁnd a Hilbert space structure on some of these functions f. A
natural way to do that is to require ∥f(g)∥Y to be square-integrable in some
sense. Because of the H-invariance in (5.9)(b), what is natural is to integrate
over the homogeneous space G/H. That is, we deﬁne a Hilbert space norm
on these functions by
(5.10)(c)
∥f∥2
X =

G/H
∥f(g)∥2
Y dg.
Here dg is some measure on G/H; the integrand is actually a function on
G/H by (5.10)(b). The Hilbert space for the G representation is then
(5.10)(d)
X = {f as in (5.7)(a) measurable, ∥f∥X < ∞}.
The group G will preserve this Hilbert space structure (that is, the represen-
tation will be unitary) if dg is a G-invariant measure.
Let us see how to use this idea and our Hilbert space representation Y Hilb
of P to construct a Hilbert space representation of G. There are two diﬃcul-
ties. First, the representation Y Hilb need not be unitary for P, so (5.10)(b)
need not hold: the function ∥f(g)∥Y Hilb need not descend to G/P. Second,
the homogeneous space G/P carries no nice G-invariant measure (unless P is
open in G); so we cannot hope to get a unitary representation of G even if
τ Hilb is unitary.
Mackey found a very general way to address the second problem, essentially
by tensoring the representation τ by a certain one-dimensional character of P
deﬁning the bundle of “half-densities” on G/P. This is the source of a strange
exponential term (for example the “ρ” in section VII.1 of [Kna86]) in many
formulas for induced representations. There is a long-winded explanation in
Chapter 3 of [Vog87]. Because we will not be using parabolic induction to
construct unitary representations, we will ignore this problem (and omit the
“ρ” from the deﬁnition of parabolic induction). If the action of G changes the

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
291
measure dg in a reasonable way, we can still hope that G will act by bounded
operators on the Hilbert space of (5.10)(d).
The ﬁrst problem is more serious, since it seems to prevent us even from
writing down an integral deﬁning a Hilbert space. The function we want to
integrate is deﬁned on all of G, but it is dangerous to integrate over G: if
the representation of P were unitary, the function would be constant on the
cosets of P, so the integral (at least with respect to Haar measure on G) would
not converge. This suggests using instead of Haar measure some measure on
G that decays at inﬁnity in some sense. (One might at ﬁrst be tempted to
use the delta function, assigning the identity element of G the measure 1 and
every other element the measure zero. This certainly takes care of convergence
problems, but this measure behaves so badly under translation by G that G
fails to act continuously on the corresponding Hilbert space).
A reasonable resolution is hiding in Proposition 5.3(5).
Proposition 5.11. Suppose P is a parabolic subgroup of the real reductive
group G, and (τ Hilb, Y Hilb) is an admissible representation of P on a Hilbert
space. Deﬁne
XHilb
cpt
= {f : K →Y Hilb measurable |
f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k),

K
∥f(k)∥2
Y Hilbdk < ∞}.
Here dk is the Haar measure on K of total mass 1; the norm on XHilb
cpt
is the
square root of the integral in the deﬁnition. Deﬁne XHilb
ind
to be the correspond-
ing space of functions on G, using the identiﬁcation in (5.9). Then XHilb
ind
is
preserved by left translation by G. The corresponding representation πHilb of
G is continuous and admissible; its restriction to K is unitary.
It may seem strange that we have obtained a unitary representation of
K even though we did not assume that τ Hilb was unitary on L ∩K. This
is possible because we have integrated over K rather than over K/L ∩K.
If we apply this proposition with P = G (so that τ Hilb is a representation
of G), then XHilb = Y Hilb as a topological vector space, but the Hilbert
space structures ∥· ∥2
Y Hilb and ∥· ∥2
XHilb are diﬀerent: the latter is obtained
by averaging the former over K.
We now have a Hilbert space globalization of a Harish-Chandra module
for G, so the machinery of section 4 can be applied. To begin, it is helpful to
write down the Harish-Chandra module for G explicitly. This is
(5.12)(a) XK = {f : G →Y Hilb | f(xp) = τ(p)−1f(x), and f left K-ﬁnite}.
In order to understand this as a vector space, it is most convenient to use the
“compact picture” of (5.9)(b):
(5.12)(b)
XK
cpt = {f : K →Y Hilb | f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), and f left K-ﬁnite}.

292
David A. Vogan, Jr
Now a function f in XK
cpt can transform on the left according to a representa-
tion µ of K only if it transforms on the right according to representations of
L ∩K appearing in the restriction of the dual of µ. It follows that the func-
tions in XK
cpt must take values in Y L∩K. (This is not true of the corresponding
functions in the induced picture (5.12)(a).) Therefore
(5.12)(c)
XK
cpt = {f : K →Y L∩K | f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), and f left K-ﬁnite}.
As in (5.9), the drawback of this description of XK is that the action of the
Lie algebra g is not as clear as in (5.12)(a).
We turn next to the determination of X∞, the space of smooth vectors in
XHilb. Recall that “smooth” refers to the diﬀerentiability of the action of G,
not directly to smoothness as functions on G. What is more or less obvious
(from standard theorems saying that functions on compact manifolds with
lots of L2 derivatives are actually smooth) is this:
f ∈XHilb
cpt
is smooth for the representation of K if and only if
(5.13)(a)
it is smooth as a function on K with values in Y Hilb.
Smoothness of a function on K may be tested by diﬀerentiating by Lie algebra
elements either on the left or on the right. Because of the transformation
property imposed under L ∩K on the right, it therefore follows that the
K-smooth vectors in XHilb must take values in Y ∞:
(5.13)(b)
XHilb,K-smooth = {f : K →Y ∞| f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), and f smooth on K}.
(Implicitly there is a Fr´echet topology here, with seminorms like
sup
k∈K
ν(λ(u) · f);
here u ∈U(k) is acting by diﬀerentiation on the left (this is λ), and ν is a
seminorm deﬁning the topology of Y ∞.) We will show that XHilb,K-smooth is
precisely the set of smooth vectors of XHilb. In order to do that, we must show
that the left translation action of G on this space (as a subspace of XHilb) is
smooth. This means that we need to describe explicitly the action of the Lie
algebra g in the compact picture.
So suppose Z ∈g. The action of Z is by diﬀerentiation on the left:
(5.14)(a)
dπ(Z)f = λ(Z)f
(f ∈XHilb).
Now diﬀerentiation on the left by an element Z of the Lie algebra (which we
have written λ(Z)) is related to diﬀerentiation on the right (written ρ(Z)) by
the adjoint action:
(5.14)(b)
[λ(Z)f](g) = [ρ(−Ad(g−1)Z)f](g).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
293
We are interested in the restriction of f to K. By Proposition 5.3(6), any Lie
algebra element W ∈g has a unique decomposition
(5.14)(c)
W = Wk + Wp,
(Wk ∈k, Wp ∈l ∩s + u ⊂p.
We apply this decomposition to the element −Ad(k−1)Z in (5.14)(b), and
use the transformation property of f on the right under τ. The conclusion is
(5.14)(d) [dπ(Z)f](k) = [ρ((−Ad(k−1)Z))kf](k) + [dτ(Ad(k−1)Z))p(f(k))].
This is a kind of ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator on functions on K with values
in Y : the ﬁrst term is a ﬁrst derivative, and the second (zeroth order) term is
just a linear operator on the values of f. We can if we like move the derivative
back to the left:
(5.14)(e)
[dπ(Z)f](k) = [λ(Ad(k)(((−Ad(k−1)Z))k)f](k) + [dτ(Ad(k−1)Z))p(f(k))].
The space of K-smooth vectors in XHilb was deﬁned by seminorms in-
volving the left action of U(k), which is analogous to constant coeﬃcient dif-
ferential operators. We have seen in (5.14)(e) that the action of g is given by
something like variable coeﬃcient diﬀerential operators on K. Because the co-
eﬃcient functions are smooth and bounded on K, this proves that the action
of G on the K-smooth vectors of XHilb is in fact diﬀerentiable. That is,
(5.15)(a)
X∞= {f : K →Y ∞| f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), f smooth on K}.
A parallel argument identiﬁes the analytic vectors
(5.15)(b)
Xω = {f : K →Y ω | f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), f analytic on K}.
Finally, there are the distribution and hyperfunction globalizations to con-
sider. Each of these requires a few more soft analysis remarks. For example,
if V is reﬂexive topological vector space with dual space V ∗, then the space
of “generalized functions” on a manifold M with values in V is by deﬁnition
C−∞(M, V ) = [C∞
c (M, V ∗⊗(densities on M))]∗,
the topological dual of the space of compactly supported smooth “test densi-
ties” on M with values in V ∗. (Topologies on the dual space are discussed in
section 8; we will be interested most of all in the strong dual topology.) We
can then deﬁne
(5.15)(c)
X−∞= {f : K →Y −∞| f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), f generalized function on K}.
This is the Casselman-Wallach distribution globalization of X. Similarly, we
can make sense of
(5.15)(d)
X−ω = {f : K →Y −ω | f(kl) = τ(l)−1f(k), f hyperfunction on K},

294
David A. Vogan, Jr
Schmid’s maximal globalization of X. We have in the end a concrete version
of (4.24):
(5.16)(a)
XK ⊂Xω ⊂X∞⊂XHilb ⊂X−∞⊂X−ω ⊂X−K.
This time each space may be regarded as “functions” on K with values in
Y −L∩K, with weakening conditions on the functions: ﬁrst K-ﬁnite, then ana-
lytic, then smooth, then L2, then distribution-valued, and so on. (Beginning
with X−∞, these are not literally “functions” on K.) It is natural and conve-
nient to write
(5.16)(b)
XK = (IndG
P )K(Y ),
Xω = (IndG
P )ω(Y ),
X∞= (IndG
P )∞(Y ),
and so on.
6 Examples of Complex Homogeneous Spaces
In this section we will begin to examine the complex homogeneous spaces
for reductive groups that we will use to construct representations. We are
going to make extensive use of the structure theory for complex reductive
Lie algebras, and for that purpose it is convenient to have at our disposal
a complex reductive group. (This means a complex Lie group that is also a
reductive group in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.6.)
Deﬁnition 6.1. A complexiﬁcation of G is a complex reductive group GC,
endowed with a Lie group homomorphism
j : G →GC,
subject to the following conditions.
(1) The map j has ﬁnite kernel.
(2) The corresponding Lie algebra map
dj : g0 →Lie(GC)
identiﬁes g0 as a real form of Lie(GC). More explicitly, this means that
Lie(GC) = dj(g0) ⊕idj(g0),
with i the complex multiplication on the complex Lie algebra Lie(GC).
Using this, we identify Lie(GC) with the complexiﬁed Lie algebra g hence-
forth.
(3) The Cartan involutions of G and GC are compatible via the map j.

It is possible to construct a complexiﬁcation that actually contains the
linear reductive group im(π) in Deﬁnition 4.6, so that j may be taken to be the
composition of an inclusion with the ﬁnite covering π. The complexiﬁcation
of G is not unique, but the ambiguity will cause us no problems. If G is the
group of real points of a reductive algebraic group, we can of course take for
GC the group of complex points; this is perhaps the most important case.
We need notation for the maximal compact subgroup of GC. It is fairly
common to refer to this group as U (perhaps in honor of the case of U(n) ⊂
GL(n, C)). Since we will also be discussing parabolic subgroups and their
unipotent radicals, the letter U will not be convenient. So we will write
CG = maximal compact subgroup of GC.
Hypothesis (3) in Deﬁnition 6.1 guarantees that
K = CG ∩G.
The complex homogeneous spaces we want will be coverings of (certain)
open orbits of G on (certain) complex homogeneous spaces for GC. Here ﬁrst
are the homogeneous spaces for GC that we want.
Deﬁnition 6.2. In the setting of (6.1), a partial ﬂag variety for GC is a
homogeneous space
X = GC/QC,
with QC a parabolic subgroup of GC (Deﬁnition 5.1). (Recall that this means
q = Lie(QC) ⊂Lie(GC) = g
is a parabolic subalgebra). It will sometimes be helpful to write
Qmax
C
= {g ∈GC | Ad(g)q = q},
Qmin
C
= connected subgroup with Lie algebra q
= identity component of Qmax
C
.
It follows from standard structure theory for complex groups that
Qmax
C
∩identity component of GC = Qmin
C
.
Each element of the partial ﬂag variety Xmin = GC/Qmax
C
may be identiﬁed
with a parabolic subalgebra of g, by
gQmax
C
→Ad(g)(q).
Each element of Xmax = GC/Qmin
C
may be identiﬁed with a pair consisting
of a parabolic subalgebra of g and a connected component of GC.
Write LC for the Levi factor of QC deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.1, and

296
David A. Vogan, Jr
CL = CG ∩QC.
Then Proposition 5.3(5) says that
X = CG/CL,
a compact homogeneous space for CG.
Theorem 6.3. (Wolf [Wol69]). Suppose GC is a complexiﬁcation of the real
reductive group G, and
X = GC/QC = CG/CL
is a partial ﬂag variety for GC (Deﬁnition 6.2). Then X is a compact complex
manifold. The group G acts on X with ﬁnitely many orbits; so the ﬁnitely
many open orbits of G on X are complex homogeneous spaces for G.
Up to covering, the spaces on which we wish to construct representations
of G are certain of these open orbits. It remains to say which ones. For that,
it is helpful to think about what an arbitrary G orbit on X can look like. We
may as well look only at the orbit of the base point eQC. This G-orbit is
(6.4)(a)
G · (eQC) ≃G/H,
(H = G ∩QC).
Let us compute the Lie algebra of the isotropy group. Write bar for the com-
plex conjugation deﬁning the real form g0 = Lie(G) of g:
(6.4)(b)
A + iB = A −iB
(A, B ∈g0).
Then bar is an involutive automorphism of g, with ﬁxed points g0. It follows
that q is another parabolic subalgebra of g, and that the complexiﬁed Lie
algebra h of H is
(6.4)(c)
h = q ∩q.
So understanding h means understanding the intersection of the two parabolic
subalgebras q and q. The key to analyzing this in general is the fact that the
intersection of any two parabolic subalgebras must contain a Cartan subalge-
bra; this is essentially equivalent to the Bruhat decomposition. (In our case it
is even true that the intersection of q and q must contain the complexiﬁcation
of a Cartan subalgebra of g0; but we will not use this.) Once one has chosen
a Cartan in both parabolics, the analysis of the intersection comes down to
combinatorics of sets of roots. There are many interesting possibilities, but we
will be looking only at two extreme cases. One extreme is q = q. In this case
H is a real parabolic subgroup of G. This is the case we looked at in section
5. The following deﬁnition describes the opposite extreme. (The terminology
“nice” is entirely artiﬁcial, and not to be taken seriously.)

Deﬁnition 6.5. Suppose G is a real reductive group with complexiﬁed Lie
algebra g. A parabolic subalgebra q ⊂g is called nice if q∩q is a Levi subalgebra
l of q. In this case the group
Lmax = {g ∈G | Ad(g)q) = q} = j−1(Qmax
C
)
is a real reductive subgroup of G. The G orbit
Xmin
0
= G · (eQC) ≃G/Lmax ⊂GC/Qmax
C
= Xmin
is open, and therefore inherits a G-invariant complex structure.
Deﬁne
Lmin = identity component of Lmax.
A real Levi factor for q is by deﬁnition any subgroup L such that Lmin ⊂L ⊂
Lmax. A measurable complex partial ﬂag variety for G is by deﬁnition any
homogeneous space X = G/L, endowed with the complex structure pulled back
by the covering map
X0 = G/L →G/Lmax = Xmin
0
⊂Xmin.
(An explanation of the term “measurable” may be found in [Wol69].)
We say that q is very nice if it is nice, and in addition q is preserved by
the complexiﬁed Cartan involution θ. In this case every real Levi factor L is
also preserved by θ, so that L ∩K is a maximal compact subgroup of L.
Obviously the condition of being “nice” is constant on Ad(G)-orbits of
parabolic subalgebras. It turns out that every nice parabolic subalgebra is
conjugate by Ad(G) to a very nice one; so we may conﬁne our attention to
those.
If G is a compact group, then every parabolic subalgebra q of g is very
nice, and measurable complex partial ﬂag varieties for G are exactly the same
thing as partial ﬂag varieties for the (canonical) complexiﬁcation of G. We
will begin to look at some noncompact examples in a moment.
Proposition 6.6. Suppose G is a real reductive group, and q is a very nice
parabolic subalgebra of g (Deﬁnition 6.5). Let L be a real Levi factor for q, so
that
X0 = G/L
is a measurable complex partial ﬂag variety for G. Then L ∩K is a real Levi
factor for the (automatically nice) parabolic subalgebra q ∩k of k, so
Z = K/L ∩K
is a (compact partial) ﬂag variety for K and for KC. The inclusion
Z = K/L ∩K  →G/L = X0
is holomorphic, and meets every connected component of X0 exactly once.

We turn now to some examples for classical groups. Recall from section
2 that a classical complex group GC is a group of linear transformations of
Cn, perhaps preserving some standard symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear
form. A real form G is the subgroup deﬁned by some kind of reality condition
on the matrices. Just as we saw in section 2 for complete ﬂag varieties, a
partial ﬂag variety for GC will be a space of partial ﬂags in Cn, subject to
some conditions involving the bilinear form deﬁning the group. We need to
analyze the orbits of G on such ﬂags, which is usually a matter of linear
algebra.
Here is an example. Suppose G = GL(n, R) and GC = GL(n, C). A partial
ﬂag variety for GC is determined by a collection m of integers
(6.7)(a)
0 = m0 < m1 < · · · < mr = n.
The variety Xm is the collection of all possible partial ﬂags
(6.7)(b) Xm = {F = (Fj) | 0 = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fr = Cn,
dim Fj = mj}.
Here each Fj is a linear subspace of Cn. There is a standard ﬂag F std, with
(6.7)(c)
F std
j
= Cmj ⊂Cn,
embedded in the ﬁrst mj coordinates. The group GC acts transitively on Xm;
the isotropy group at the base point F std consists of block upper triangular
matrices
(6.7)(d)

So how does one understand the orbits of GL(n, R) on this space? If F is
a ﬂag of type m, then so is F. (If W is a subspace of Cn, then W consists of
all the complex conjugates of vectors in W.) The collection of dimensions
(6.7)(e)
dimC(Fj ∩F k)
is obviously constant on GL(n, R) orbits in Xm; and it is not very hard to
show that these invariants specify the GL(n, R) orbits completely. It is also not
so diﬃcult to describe exactly what sets of dimensions are possible. Roughly
speaking, the open orbits of GL(n, R) should be “generic,” and so should be
characterized by having all the dimensions in (6.7)(e) as small as possible. It
is an excellent exercise for the reader to work this out in detail for complete
ﬂags; the conclusion in that case is that the GL(n, R) orbits correspond to
elements of order 2 in the symmetric group Sn. (For complete ﬂags in general
split real groups G, there is a surjective map from G orbits to elements of
order 2 in the Weyl group, but the map can have non-trivial ﬁbers.)
We will analyze instead the much simpler case

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
299
(6.8)(a)
m = (0, m, n).
In this case
(6.8)(b)
Xm = {F ⊂Cn | dim F = m}
is the Grassmann variety of m-planes in Cn. The unique invariant of a
GL(n, R) orbit on Xm is the integer
(6.8)(c)
r = dim(F ∩F) ⩽m.
The integer r is a measure of the “reality” of F: F is the complexiﬁcation
of a real subspace if and only if r = m. The GL(n, R) orbit corresponding
to r = m is the real Grassmann variety of m-planes in Rn, and the isotropy
groups are examples of the real parabolic subgroups studied in section 5.
We are interested now in the opposite case, when r is as small as possible.
How small is that? The constraint comes from the fact that dim(F + F) ⩽n.
The sum has dimension 2m −r, so we ﬁnd 2m −r ⩽n, or equivalently
r ⩾2m −n. The conclusion is that possible values of r are
(6.8)(d)
min(0, 2m −n) ⩽r ⩽m.
The unique open orbit of GL(n, R) on Xm corresponds to the smallest possible
value of r; it is
(6.8)(e)
Xm,0 = {F ⊂Cn | dim F = m,
dim(F ∩F) = min(0, 2m −n)},
a complex homogeneous space for GL(n, R).
For deﬁniteness, let us now concentrate on the case
(6.8)(f)
2m ⩾n.
In this case we are looking at subspaces F ⊂Cn such that
(6.8)(g)
0 ⊂
F ∩F

⊂F + F = Cn.
Let us now look at the corresponding parabolic subalgebra q, the stabilizer of
F. We can choose a basis of Cn so that
F ∩F = span of middle 2m −n basis vectors
(6.8)(h)
F = span of ﬁrst m basis vectors
F = span of last m basis vectors
In these coordinates, we compute

which has dimension 2(n −m)(2m −n). It follows that q ∩q is not reductive
when n/2 < m < n: in these cases, the complex homogeneous space Xm,0 is
not “measurable” in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.5. (The same conclusion applies
to the cases 0 < m < n/2.)
We now look more closely at the case n = 2m. Recall that a complex
structure on a real vector space V is a linear map J such that J2 = −I.
Proposition 6.9. Suppose n = 2m is a positive even integer. Deﬁne
X = Xm,0 = {F ⊂C2m | dim F = m,
F ∩F = 0}.
Then X is a measurable complex partial ﬂag variety for GL(2m, R). Its points
may be identiﬁed with complex structures on R2m; the identiﬁcation sends a
complex structure J to the +i-eigenspace of J acting on (R2m)C = C2m.
The isotropy group at a subspace F corresponding to the complex structure
JF consists of all linear automorphisms of R2m commuting with the complex
structure JF ; that is, of complex-linear automorphisms of the corresponding
m-dimensional complex vector space. In particular, if we choose as a base
point of Xm,0 the standard complex structure, then the isotropy group is
L = GL(m, C) ⊂GL(2m, R).
This base point is “very nice” in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.5. The corre-
sponding O(n) orbit is

This compact subvariety consists of all orthogonal complex structures on R2m
(those for which multiplication by i preserves length).
We conclude this section with an easier example: the case of U(p, q). We
begin with non-negative integers p and q, and write n = p + q. There is a
standard Hermitian form

of signature (p, q) on Cn. The indeﬁnite unitary group of signature (p, q) is
(6.10)(b)
U(p, q) = {g ∈GL(n, C) | ⟨g · v, g · w⟩p,q = ⟨v, w⟩p,q
(v, w ∈Cn)}
Just as in the case of U(n), it is easy to check that every n×n complex matrix
Z can be written uniquely as Z = A + iB, with A and B in Lie(U(p, q)). It
follows that GL(n, C) is a complexiﬁcation of G. Let us ﬁx a partial ﬂag variety
Xm as in (6.7), and try to understand the orbits of U(p, q) on Xm. Consider
a ﬂag F = (Fj) in Xm. The orthogonal complement F ⊥
k (with respect to the
form ⟨·.·⟩p,q) is a subspace of dimension n −mk; we therefore get a partial
ﬂag consisting of the subspaces Fj ∩F ⊥
k inside Fj. The dimensions of these
subspaces are invariants of the U(p, q) orbit of F. We are interested in open
orbits, where the dimensions are as small as possible. The minimum possible
dimensions are
(6.10)(c)
dim Fj ∩F ⊥
k =
*
mj −mk,
k ⩽j
0,
j ⩽k.
Looking in particular at the case k = j, we see that on an open orbit, Fj∩F ⊥
j =
0. This means that the restriction of ⟨·.·⟩p,q to Fj will be a non-degenerate
Hermitian form, which will therefore have some signature (p(Fj), q(Fj)) =
(pj, qj). These non-negative integers must satisfy the conditions
(6.10)(d)
pj+qj = mj,
0 = p0 ⩽p1 ⩽· · · ⩽pr = p,
0 = q0 ⩽q1 ⩽· · · ⩽qr = q.
These sequences (p, q) are invariants of the U(p, q) orbit of F. Conversely, if
F ′ is any other ﬂag giving rise to the same sequence of signatures, then it is
easy to ﬁnd an element of U(p, q) carrying F to F ′. The following proposition
summarizes this discussion, and some easy calculations.
Proposition 6.11. Suppose Xm is a partial ﬂag variety for GL(n, C) as in
(6.7). The open orbits of U(p, q) on Xm are in one-to-one correspondence with
pairs of sequences (p, q) as in (6.10)(d). Write Xp,q for the corresponding
orbit. Each of these orbits is measurable (Deﬁnition 6.5). The corresponding
real Levi factor (Deﬁnition 6.5) is isomorphic to
r

U(pj −pj−1, qj −qj−1).

7 Dolbeault Cohomology and Maximal Globalizations
The central idea in these notes is this: we want to construct representations of
a real reductive group G by starting with a measurable complex ﬂag variety
X = G/L (Deﬁnition 6.5) and using G-equivariant holomorphic vector bun-
dles on X. For G compact connected, the Borel-Weil theorem (Theorem 2.3)
says that all irreducible representations of G arise in this way, as spaces of
holomorphic sections of holomorphic line bundles. In order to get some feeling
for what to expect about noncompact groups, we look ﬁrst at the example of
U(1, 1). In the language of Proposition 6.11, let us take r = 2 and consider
the complete ﬂag variety for GL(2, C), corresponding to
(7.1)(a)
m = (0, 1, 2).
Explicitly, Xm is just the projective space CP1 of lines in C2. We identify
(7.1)(b)
(C ∪∞) ≃Xm,



z

We consider the open U(1, 1) orbit Xp,q with
p = (0, 1, 1),
q = (0, 0, 1).
Explicitly, these are the lines in C2 on which the Hermitian form ⟨·.·⟩1,1 is
strictly positive. Because
⟨

it follows that the identiﬁcation of (7.1)(b) gives
(7.1)(c)
Xp,q ≃{z ∈C | |z| < 1},
the unit disc. The action of U(1, 1) on the disc is by linear fractional trans-
formations as in (3.2); the reason is

The standard base point is the origin z = 0, where the isotropy group is
U(1)×U(1). It follows that equivariant holomorphic line bundles on Xp,q are
in one-to-one correspondence with characters
(7.1)(d)
µ = (m1, m2) ∈(U(1) × U(1)) ≃Z2.
Write Lµ for the holomorphic line bundle corresponding to µ. Because µ
extends to a holomorphic character of the group of complex upper triangular
matrices, Lµ extends to a GL(2, C)-equivariant holomorphic line bundle on
the Riemann sphere Xm.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis

The most straightforward analogy with the Borel-Weil theorem suggests
deﬁning
(7.1)(e)
Hµ = holomorphic sections of Lµ.
If we endow this space with the topology of uniform convergence on compact
sets, then it is a complete topological vector space, and the action πµ of
G = U(1, 1) by left translation is continuous.
Proposition 7.2. The representation πµ of U(1, 1) is always inﬁnite-dimen-
sional. It is irreducible unless µ is antidominant; that is, unless m1 ⩽m2.
If µ is antidominant, there is exactly one proper closed G-invariant subspace:
the (m2 −m1 + 1)-dimensional space of sections extending holomorphically to
the entire Riemann sphere Xm.
Here are some hints about proofs. Any holomorphic line bundle on the
disc is holomorphically (although not equivariantly!) trivial, so the space of
sections may be identiﬁed with holomorphic functions on the disc; this is
certainly inﬁnite-dimensional. For µ anti-dominant, Theorem 2.3 provides a
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of sections extending to the Riemann sphere. The
dimension calculation is a standard fact about U(2), and the invariance of
this subspace is clear.
For the remaining assertions, examining Taylor series expansions shows
that every U(1) × U(1) weight of Hµ is of the form (m1 + k, m2 −k), with
k a non-negative integer; and that each of these weights has multiplicity one.
Now one can apply facts about Verma modules for gl(2) to ﬁnish.
Proposition 7.2 is a bit discouraging with respect to the possibility of
extending Theorem 2.3 to noncompact groups. The case of U(2, 1) is even
worse. Let us look at
(7.3)(a)
m = (0, 1, 2, 3),
p = (0, 1, 1, 2),
q = (0, 0, 1, 1).
Then Xp,q consists of complete ﬂags F with the property that the Hermitian
form is positive on F1 and of signature (1, 1) on F2. The isotropy group at the
standard base point is U(1)3, and its characters are given by triples
(7.3)(b)
µ = (m1, m2, m3) ∈Z3
Write Lµ for the corresponding equivariant holomorphic line bundle on
Xp,q (which automatically extends to be GL(3, C)-equivariant on Xm) and
(πµ, Hµ) for the representation of U(2, 1) on its space of holomorphic sections.
Proposition 7.4. In the setting of (7.3), the representation πµ of U(2, 1) is
zero unless µ is antidominant; that is, unless m1 ⩽m2 ⩽m3. In that case
it is ﬁnite-dimensional, and all holomorphic sections extend to the full ﬂag
variety Xm.

David A. Vogan, Jr
Again one can use Taylor series to relate the Harish-Chandra module of
Hµ to a highest weight module. What one needs to know is that if V is an
irreducible highest weight module for gl(3), and the non-simple root gl(2)
subalgebra acts in a locally ﬁnite way, then V is ﬁnite-dimensional. Again we
omit the details.
The behavior in Proposition 7.4 is typical. Holomorphic sections of vector
bundles on measurable complex partial ﬂag varieties rarely produce anything
except ﬁnite-dimensional representations of G. One way to understand this
is that the varieties fail to be Stein, so we should not expect to understand
them looking only at holomorphic sections: we must also consider “higher
cohomology.” We begin with a brief review of Dolbeault cohomology.
Suppose X is a complex manifold, with complexiﬁed tangent bundle TCX.
The complex structure on X provides a decomposition
(7.5)(a)
TCX = T 1,0 ⊕T 0,1
into holomorphic and antiholomorphic tangent vectors. These may be under-
stood as the +i and −i eigenspaces of the complex structure map J (deﬁning
“multiplication by i” in the real tangent space.) The two subspaces are in-
terchanged by complex conjugation. The space T 0,1 consists of the tangent
vectors annihilating holomorphic functions: the Cauchy-Riemann equations
are in T 0,1.
There is a terminological dangerous bend here. One might think that a
smooth section of T 1,0 should be called a “holomorphic vector ﬁeld,” but in
fact this terminology should be reserved only for holomorphic sections (once
those are deﬁned). We will call a smooth section a vector ﬁeld of type (1, 0).
On C, the vector ﬁeld
x ∂
∂z = x
2
 ∂
∂x −i ∂

is of type (1, 0), but is not holomorphic. If we replace the coeﬃcient function
x by 1 (or by any holomorphic function), we get a holomorphic vector ﬁeld.
Write
Am = complex-valued diﬀerential forms of degree m on X,
(7.5)(b)


p+q=m
Ap,q.
Here Ap,q consists of diﬀerential forms that vanish on sets of p′ type (1, 0)
vector ﬁelds and q′ type (0, 1) vector ﬁelds unless p′ = p and q′ = q. The de
Rham diﬀerential
d: Am →Am+1
satisﬁes
(7.5)(c)
d(Ap,q) ⊂Ap+1,q ⊕Ap,q+1.

and the fact the Lie bracket of two type (1, 0) (respectively type (0, 1)) vector
ﬁelds is type (1, 0) (respectively type (0, 1)). Now the decomposition in (7.5)(c)
allows us to write d = ∂+ ∂, with
(7.5)(d)
∂: Ap,q →Ap+1,q,
∂: Ap,q →Ap,q+1
The fact that d2 = 0 implies that
(7.5)(e)
∂2 = ∂
2 = 0,
∂∂+ ∂∂= 0.
If we try to write explicit formulas for ∂and ∂, the only diﬃculty arises
from terms involving [Y, Z], with Y a vector ﬁeld of type (1, 0) and Z of type
(0, 1). The bracket is again a vector ﬁeld, so it decomposes as
[Y, Z] = [Y, Z]1,0 + [Y, Z]0,1.
The ﬁrst summand will appear in a formula for ∂, and the second in a formula
for ∂. One way to avoid this unpleasantness is to notice that if Y is actually
a holomorphic vector ﬁeld, then the ﬁrst summand [Y, Z]1,0 is automatically
zero; one can take this as a deﬁnition of a holomorphic vector ﬁeld on X. If
Z is antiholomorphic, then the second summand vanishes.
Here are the formulas that emerge.
Proposition 7.6. Suppose X is a complex manifold, ω ∈Ap,q is a complex-
valued diﬀerential form of type (p, q) (cf. (7.5)), (Y0, . . . Yp) are holomorphic
vector ﬁelds, and (Z0, . . . , Zq) are antiholomorphic vector ﬁelds. Then

Deﬁnition 7.7. Suppose X is a complex manifold. The (p, q)-Dolbeault co-
homology of X is by deﬁnition
Hp,q(X) = (kernel of ∂on Ap,q)/(image of ∂from Ap,q−1).
This makes sense because of (7.5)(e). The space Ap,0 consists of smooth sec-
tions of the bundle Ωp of holomorphic p-forms on X; and it is easy to check
that
Hp,0 = kernel of ∂on Ap,0
= holomorphic p-forms on X.
In particular,
H0,0 = holomorphic functions on X.
Suppose now that V is a holomorphic vector bundle on X. One cannot
apply the de Rham diﬀerential to forms with values in a bundle, because
there is no canonical way to diﬀerentiate sections of a bundle by a vector ﬁeld.
However, we can apply type (0, 1) vector ﬁelds canonically to smooth sections
of a holomorphic vector bundle. Here is how this looks locally. Suppose Z is a
type (0, 1) vector ﬁeld (near x ∈X), and v is a smooth section of V (deﬁned
near x). Choose a basis (v1, . . . , vd) of holomorphic sections of V (still near x)
and write
(7.8)(a)
v =

givi,
with gi smooth on X (near x). Finally, deﬁne
(7.8)(b)
Z · v =

(Z · gi)vi.
Why is this well-deﬁned? If we choose a diﬀerent basis (v′
1, . . . , v′
d), then it
diﬀers from the ﬁrst by an invertible matrix Bij of holomorphic functions on
X (near x):
vi =

j
Bijv′
j.
If we expand v in the new basis, the coeﬃcient functions g′
i are
g′
j =

i
giBij.
Applying the vector ﬁeld Z and using the Leibnitz rule gives

Z · g′
j =

[(Z · gi)Bij + gi(Z · Bij)].
The second terms all vanish, because Z is a type (0, 1) vector ﬁeld and Bij
is a holomorphic function. What remains says (after multiplying by v′
j and
summing over j) that


that is, that our deﬁnition of Z · v is well-deﬁned.
What follows from (7.8) is that the Dolbeault ∂operator can be deﬁned
on (p, q) forms with values in a holomorphic vector bundle on X. Here is an
explicit account. Write
(7.9)(a)
Ap,q(V) = smooth (p, q) forms on X with values in V.
An element of this space attaches to p type (1, 0) vector ﬁelds and q type
(0, 1) vector ﬁelds a smooth section of V. The Dolbeault operator
(7.9)(b)
∂: Ap,q(V) →Ap,q+1(V)
is deﬁned by the formula in Proposition 7.6, with the terms of the form
(7.9)(c)
Zi · (smooth section of V)
deﬁned by (7.8). If we need to be more explicit, we may write this operator
as ∂
p,q(V). Just as in (7.5)(e), we have
∂
2 = 0.
Deﬁnition 7.10. Suppose X is a complex manifold, and V is a holomorphic
vector bundle on X. The (p, q)-Dolbeault cohomology of X with coeﬃcients
in V is by deﬁnition
Hp,q(X, V) = (kernel of ∂on Ap,q(V))/(image of ∂from Ap,q−1(V)).
This makes sense because of (7.5)(e). The space A0,0(V) consists of smooth
sections of V, and
H0,0(X, V) = kernel of ∂on A0,0(V)
= holomorphic p-forms on X.
In particular,
H0,0 = holomorphic sections of V.

308
David A. Vogan, Jr
As a ﬁrst application, we can understand the dependence of Dolbeault
cohomology on p. Recall that Ωp is the bundle of holomorphic p-forms on X.
It is easy to see that
Ap,q(V) ≃A0,q(Ωp ⊗V),
and that this isomorphism respects the ∂operators (up to a factor of (−1)p).
It follows that
Hp,q(X, V) ≃H0,q(X, Ωp ⊗V).
Here is the central fact about Dolbeault cohomology.
Theorem 7.11. (Dolbeault, Serre [Ser55]). Suppose V is a holomorphic vec-
tor bundle on a complex manifold X. Write OV for the sheaf of germs of
holomorphic sections of V. Then there is a canonical isomorphism
H0,q(X, V) ≃Hq(X, OV).
On the right is the ˇCech cohomology of X with coeﬃcients in the sheaf OV.
It may be helpful to see how Dolbeault cohomology looks on a homoge-
neous space. For this we can allow G to be any Lie group and L any closed
subgroup. Write
(7.12)(a)
X = G/L,
g = Lie(G)C ⊃Lie(L)C = l.
A G-invariant complex structure on G/L corresponds to a complex Lie sub-
algebra q ⊂g satisfying
(7.12)(b)
Ad(L)q = q,
q + q = g,
q ∩q = l.
In terms of the decomposition in (7.5)(a), q corresponds to the antiholomor-
phic tangent vectors:
(7.12)(c)
T 0,1
eL (G/L) = q/l,
T 1,0
eL (G/L) = q/l.
(All of this is described for example in [TW71] or in [Vog87], Proposition
1.19.) A complex-valued smooth vector ﬁeld on G/L may be identiﬁed with a
smooth function
(7.12)(d)
Y : G →g/l,
Y (gl) = Ad(l)−1Y (g)
(l ∈L, g ∈G)
(cf. (5.7)(a)). In this identiﬁcation, vector ﬁelds of type (0, 1) are those taking
values in q/l. Smooth functions on G/L correspond to smooth functions
f : G →C,
f(gl) = f(g).
The vector ﬁeld Y acts on f by
(7.12)(e)
(Y · f)(g) = [ρ(Y (g)) · f](g).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
309
That is, we diﬀerentiate f on the right by the Lie algebra element Y (g). (Of
course Y (g) is only a coset of l, but that is harmless since f is invariant on
the right by L. The condition on Y in (7.12)(d) forces the new function Y · f
also to be right invariant by L.)
From the identiﬁcation in (7.12)(d), it is not hard to deduce an identiﬁca-
tion of the smooth m-forms on G/L:
(7.13)(a)
Am(G/L) ≃HomL
6m
(g/l), C∞(G)

.
Here L acts on the exterior algebra by Ad, and on the smooth functions by
right translation. The decomposition
g/l = q/l ⊕q/l
(which follows from (7.12)(b)) gives
6m
(g/l) =

p+q=m
6p
(q/l) ⊗
6q
(q/l),
and a corresponding decomposition of the m-forms. The pieces are exactly
the (p, q) forms of (7.5)(b):
(7.13)(b)
Ap,q(G/L) ≃HomL
6p
(q/l) ⊗
6q
(q/l), C∞(G)

.
Writing formulas for the operators ∂and ∂in this setting is slightly unpleas-
ant, because the description of vector ﬁelds in (7.12)(d) does not obviously
hand us any holomorphic or antiholomorphic vector ﬁelds. We will sweep this
problem under the rug for the moment, by not writing formulas yet.
A smooth equivariant vector bundle V on G/L is the same thing as a
smooth representation (τ, V ) of L; the correspondence is
(7.13)(c)
V →(ﬁber of V at eL),
V →G ×L V.
The space of smooth sections of V may be identiﬁed with smooth functions
(7.13)(d)
f : G →V,
f(gl) = τ(l)−1f(g)
(l ∈L, g ∈G).
This description makes sense for inﬁnite-dimensional vector bundles. What
does it mean for V to be a holomorphic vector bundle? Certainly this ought
to amount to imposing some additional structure on the representation (τ, V )
of L. Here is the appropriate deﬁnition, taken from [TW71].
Deﬁnition 7.14. Suppose L is a Lie group with complexiﬁed Lie algebra l.
Assume that q is a complex Lie algebra containing l, and the adjoint action
of L extends to
Ad: L →Aut(q),
with diﬀerential the Lie bracket of l on q. A (q, L)-representation is a complete
locally convex vector space V , endowed with a smooth representation τ of
L and a continuous Lie algebra action (written just with a dot). These are
required to satisfy

310
David A. Vogan, Jr
(1) The q action extends the diﬀerential of τ: if Y ∈l and v ∈V , then
dτ(Y )v = Y · v.
(2) For l ∈L, Z ∈q, and v ∈V , we have
τ(l)(Z · v) = (Ad(l)Z) · (τ(l)v).
For l ∈L0, condition (2) is a consequence of condition (1).
Condition (2) can also be formulated as requiring that the action map
q × V →V,
(Z, v) →Z · v
is L-equivariant. This entire deﬁnition is formally very close to that of a
(g, K)-module in Deﬁnition 4.14, except that we have no ﬁniteness assumption
on the L representation.
Proposition 7.15. Suppose G/L is a homogeneous space for Lie groups, and
that q deﬁnes an invariant complex structure (cf. (7.12)). Then passage to the
ﬁber at eL deﬁnes a bijective correspondence from G-equivariant holomorphic
vector bundles V on G/L, to (q, L)-representations (τ, V ) (Deﬁnition 7.14).
Suppose U is an open subset of G/L, and U its inverse image in G. Then
holomorphic sections of V on U correspond to smooth functions
f : U →V
satisfying the transformation law
f(gl) = τ(l)−1f(g)
(l ∈L, g ∈U)
and the diﬀerential equations
(ρ(Z)f)(g) = Z · (f(g))
(Z ∈q, g ∈U).
Here ρ is the right regular representation of the Lie algebra on smooth func-
tions.
To be more honest and precise: this result is certainly true for ﬁnite-
dimensional bundles (where it is proved in [TW71]). I have not thought care-
fully about the appropriate abstract deﬁnition of inﬁnite-dimensional holo-
morphic vector bundles; but that deﬁnition needs to be arranged so that
Proposition 7.15 is true.
The transformation law in Proposition 7.15 is just what describes a smooth
section of V (cf. (7.13)(d)). For Z ∈l, the diﬀerential equation is a consequence
of the transformation law. The diﬀerential equations for other elements of q
are the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
Lie algebra cohomology was invented for the purpose of studying de Rham
cohomology of homogeneous spaces. It is therefore not entirely surprising that
Dolbeault cohomology (which we described in (7.5) as built from de Rham
cohomology) is also related to Lie algebra cohomology. To state the result, we
need one more deﬁnition.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
311
Deﬁnition 7.16. Suppose V is a (q, L)-representation (Deﬁnition 7.14).
The complex deﬁning Lie algebra cohomology is
Cm(q; V ) = Hom

The diﬀerential is

+

i<j
(−1)i+jω(Z0, . . . , Zi, . . . , Zj, . . . , Zm)
The Lie algebra cohomology of q with coeﬃcients in V is by deﬁnition
Hm(q; V ) = (kernel of d on Cm(q; V ))/(image of d from Cm−1(q; V )).
We now consider the subspace
Cm(q, L; V ) = HomL
6m
q/l, V

.
We are imposing two conditions: that ω vanish on the ideal generated by l in
the exterior algebra, and that the linear map ω respect the action of L (by
Ad on the domain and τ on the range). The diﬀerential d respects the second
condition; and in the presence of the second condition, it respects the ﬁrst as
well. We can therefore deﬁne the relative Lie algebra cohomology of q with
coeﬃcients in V as
Hm(q, L; V )=(kernel of d on Cm(q, L; V ))/(image of d from Cm−1(q, L; V)).
This cohomology is most often considered in the case when L is compact.
One reason is that when L is not compact, taking L invariants (as in HomL
in the deﬁnition of the relative complex) is not an exact functor, and should
really only be considered along with its derived functors. This diﬃculty will
come back to haunt us in section 9, but for now we ignore it.
Here now is Kostant’s description of Dolbeault cohomology for equivariant
bundles.
Proposition 7.17. (Kostant [Kos61], (6.3.5); see also [Won99], section 2).
Suppose G/L is a homogeneous space for Lie groups, and that q deﬁnes an in-
variant complex structure (cf.(7.12)). Suppose (τ, V ) is a (q, L)-representation
(Deﬁnition 7.14), and V the corresponding G-equivariant holomorphic vec-
tor bundle on G/L (Proposition 7.15). We regard C∞(G, V ) as a (q, L)-
representation by the “tensor product” of the right regular action on functions
with the action on V . Explicitly, the representation τr of L is
[τr(l)f](g) = τ(l)f(gl−1).

312
David A. Vogan, Jr
The action of Z ∈q is
[Z · f](g) = [ρ(Z)f](g) + Z · (f(g)).
The ﬁrst term is the right regular action of g on functions, and the second is
the action of q on V .
Then the space of smooth (0, q) forms on G/L with values in V is
A0,q(G/L, V) ≃HomL
6q
(q/l), C∞(G, V )

= Cq(q, L; C∞(G, V )),
(Deﬁnition 7.16). This identiﬁes the Dolbeault diﬀerential ∂with the relative
Lie algebra cohomology diﬀerential d, and so
H0,q(G/L, V) ≃Hq(q, L; C∞(G, V )).
To talk about (p, q) Dolbeault cohomology, we can use the fact mentioned
before Theorem 7.11. This involves the bundle Ωp of holomorphic p-forms
on X; so we need to understand Ωp in the case of X = G/L. This is an
equivariant vector bundle, so it corresponds to a certain representation of L:
the pth exterior power of the holomorphic cotangent space (T 1,0
eL )∗. According
to (7.12)(c), this is
6p
(q/l).
To specify the holomorphic structure, we need a representation of q on this
space, extending the adjoint action of l. This we can get from the natural
isomorphism
q/l ≃g/q,
which is a consequence of (7.12)(b). That is, in the correspondence of Propo-
sition 7.15,
(7.18)(a)
Ωp ↔
6p
(g/q)∗,
with the obvious structure of (q, L)-representation on the right. A consequence
of this fact, Proposition 7.17, and the fact before Theorem 7.11 is
(7.18)(b)
Hp,q(G/L, V) ≃Hq(q, L; C∞(G,
6p
(g/q)∗⊗V )).
With Dolbeault cohomology in our tool box, we can now make the idea at
the beginning of this section a little more precise. Beginning with a measur-
able complex ﬂag variety X = G/L and a G-equivariant holomorphic vector
bundle V over X, we want to consider representations of G on Dolbeault co-
homology spaces Hp,q(X, V). First of all, notice that G acts by translation on
the forms Ap,q(V) (cf. (7.9)), and that this action respects ∂. It follows that
we get a linear action of G on the Dolbeault cohomology. To have a repre-
sentation, of course we need a topological vector space structure. The space
of V-valued diﬀerential forms (for any smooth vector bundle on any smooth

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
313
manifold) naturally has such a structure; in our case, the forms are described
in Proposition 7.17 as a closed subspace of the (complete locally convex) space
C∞(G, V ) tensored with a ﬁnite-dimensional space. (This shows in particular
that if V is Fr´echet, then so is Ap,q(V).) With respect to this topology, any
diﬀerential operator is continuous; so in particular the ∂operator is contin-
uous, and its kernel is a closed subspace of Ap,q(V). It is also clear that the
action of G on Ap,q(V) is continuous.
We can impose on Hp,q(X, V) the quotient topology coming from the kernel
of ∂: a subset of the cohomology is open (or closed) if and only if its preimage
in the kernel of ∂is open (or closed). The action of G is clearly continuous
for this quotient topology. The diﬃculty is that the closure of the point 0 in
the quotient topology is equal to
(closure of the image of ∂)/(image of ∂).
In particular, the topology is Hausdorﬀonly if the image of ∂is closed. This
diﬃculty is essentially the only diﬃculty: if W is a complete locally convex
Hausdorﬀspace and U is a closed subspace, then the quotient topology on
W/U is complete and locally convex Hausdorﬀ. (In these notes “Hausdorﬀ” is
part of the deﬁnition of “locally convex”; I have mentioned it explicitly here
only for emphasis.)
Here is a summary of this discussion.
Proposition 7.19. Suppose X = G/L is a measurable complex ﬂag variety
for the real reductive group G (Deﬁnition 6.5), and that V is the holomor-
phic vector bundle on X attached to a (q, L)-representation (τ, V ). Endow
the Dolbeault cohomology Hp,q(X, V) with the quotient topology as above, and
deﬁne
Hp,q
top(X, V) = maximal Hausdorﬀquotient of Hp,q(X, V)
= kernel of ∂/closure of image of ∂.
Then Hp,q
top(X, V) carries a smooth representation of G (by translation of
forms).
Serious geometers ﬁnd the notion of Hp,q
top in this result to be anathema.
Many of the long exact sequences (that make life worth living in sheaf theory)
are lost on this quotient. Nevertheless, representation theory seems to demand
this quotient. We will make use of it once more in section 8, to formulate
Serre’s duality theorem for Dolbeault cohomology.
In the end our examples will oﬀer no conclusive evidence about the value
of the notion of Hp,q
top(X, V). We will recall next a theorem of Hon Wai Wong
which says that in all of the cases we will consider, the operator ∂has closed
range.
The ﬁrst deﬁnition is analogous to Deﬁnition 5.6.

314
David A. Vogan, Jr
Deﬁnition 7.20. Suppose G is a real reductive group, q is a very nice par-
abolic subalgebra of the complexiﬁed Lie algebra g, and L is a Levi factor of
for q (Deﬁnition 6.5). A (q, L) representation (τ, V ) (Deﬁnition 7.14) is said
to be admissible if the representation τ of L is admissible (Deﬁnition 4.12).
In this case the Harish-Chandra module of V is the (q, L ∩K)-module V L∩K
of L ∩K-ﬁnite vectors in V .
Because q = l⊕u, with u an L-stable ideal in q, every admissible represen-
tation (τ, V ) of L extends canonically to an admissible (q, L) representation,
by making u act by zero. If (τ, V ) is irreducible for L, then this is the only
possible extension. But if the representation of L is reducible, then other ex-
tensions exist, and even arise in practice.
Theorem 7.21. (Wong [Won99], Theorem 2.4). In the setting of Deﬁnition
7.20, assume that the admissible representation V is the maximal globaliza-
tion of the underlying (q, L ∩K) module. Let V be the G-equivariant holo-
morphic vector bundle on X = G/L attached to V (Proposition 7.15). Then
the ∂operator for Dolbeault cohomology has closed range, so that each of the
spaces Hp,q(X, V) carries a smooth representation of G. Each of these rep-
resentations is admissible, and is the maximal globalization of its underlying
Harish-Chandra module.
Wong goes on to explain how these Harish-Chandra modules are con-
structed from V L∩K, by a process called “cohomological parabolic induction.”
We will say only a little about this.
This theorem should be compared to Proposition 5.11, to which it bears
some formal resemblance. In detail it is unfortunately much weaker. With
real parabolic induction, using any globalization on L led to a globalization of
the same Harish-Chandra module on G. In the present setting that statement
may be true, but Wong’s methods seem not to prove it.
Another diﬀerence is that in section 5 we were able to get many diﬀerent
globalizations just by varying the kinds of functions we used. The situation
here is quite diﬀerent. It is perfectly possible to consider (for example) the
Dolbeault complex with generalized function coeﬃcients instead of smooth
functions. But the resulting Dolbeault cohomology turns out to be exactly
the same. (This is certainly true if the vector bundle V is ﬁnite-dimensional,
and it should be possible to prove a version for inﬁnite-dimensional bundles
as well.)
One goal of this section was to ﬁnd a reasonable extension of the Borel-
Weil Theorem to noncompact reductive groups. Theorem 2.3 suggested that
one might look at bundles that are “antidominant” in some sense; but Propo-
sitions 7.2 and 7.4 suggested that antidominant is not such a good choice for
noncompact G. I will dispense with further illuminating examples, and instead
pass directly to the deﬁnition we want.
Suppose therefore that
(7.22)(a)
q = l + u

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
315
is a very nice parabolic subalgebra (Deﬁnition 6.5), and L is a real Levi factor
for q. Write
(7.22)(b)
X = G/L,
dimC X = dimC(u) = n
(7.22)(c)
Z = K/L ∩K,
dimC Z = dimC(u ∩k) = s
Because of (7.18)(b), we are going to need
(7.22)(d)
2ρ(u) = representation of L on
6n
(g/q)∗
This is a one-dimensional character of L, so its diﬀerential (which we also
write as 2ρ(u)) is a linear functional on the Lie algebra l:
(7.22)(e)
2ρ(u): l →C,
2ρ(u)(Y ) = trace of ad(Y ) on (g/q)∗
This linear functional is of course divisible by two, so we can deﬁne ρ(u) ∈
l∗, even though the group character 2ρ(u) may have no square root. Any
G-invariant symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form on g provides an
L-equivariant identiﬁcation
(7.22)(f)
(g/q)∗≃u,
which allows for some simpliﬁcations in the formulas for 2ρ(u).
Let (τ L∩K, V L∩K) be an irreducible Harish-Chandra module for L, and
(τ ω, V ω) its maximal globalization. Regard V ω as (q, L)-representation by
making u act by zero. Let
(7.22)(g)
Vω = G ×L V
be the associated holomorphic vector bundle on X (Proposition 7.15).
We want to write a condition on τ, more or less analogous to “antidomi-
nant” in Theorem 2.3, that will force Dolbeault cohomology with coeﬃcients
in Vω to be well-behaved. For this purpose, a little bit of structure theory in
the enveloping algebra is needed. Put
(7.23)(a)
Z(g) = center of U(g)
The group G acts by algebra automorphisms on Z(g); the G0 action is trivial,
so G/G0 is a ﬁnite group of automorphisms. We need the ﬁxed point algebra
(7.23)(b)
ZG(g) = {u ∈U(g) | Ad(g)u = u, all g ∈G} ⊂Z(g).
(The ﬁrst algebra appeared already in the deﬁnition of admissible representa-
tions in Deﬁnition 4.12.) These algebras are described by the Harish-Chandra
isomorphism. For that, ﬁx a Cartan subalgebra

316
David A. Vogan, Jr
(7.23)(c)
h ⊂l
The Weyl group of h in g (generated by root reﬂections) is written
(7.23)(d)
W = W(g, h).
The Harish-Chandra isomorphism is
(7.23)(e)
ξg : Z(g)
∼
→S(h)W (g,h).
The disconnectedness of G provides a slightly larger group
(7.23)(e)
W G(g, h) ⊂Aut(g),
still acting as automorphisms of the root system. (We omit the deﬁnition in
general. In the special case that every component of G has an element nor-
malizing h, then W G is generated by W(g, h) and the automorphisms coming
from Ad(G).) The group W G contains W(g, h) as a normal subgroup, and
there is a natural surjective homomorphism
(7.23)(f)
G/G0 ↠W G(g, h)/W(g, h).
Now G/G0 acts on Z(g), and W G/W acts on S(h)W . These two actions are
compatible via the Harish-Chandra isomorphism of (7.23)(e) and (7.23)(f). In
particular, we get an isomorphism
(7.23)(g)
ξG : ZG(g)
∼
→S(h)W G(g,h).
It follows from (7.23) that there is a bijection
(7.24)(a)
(algebra homomorphisms ZG(g) →C)
←→
h∗/W G(g, h).
The connection with representation theory is this. On any irreducible ad-
missible representation (π, U) of G, the algebra ZG(g) must act by scalars.
Consequently there is an element
(7.24)(b)
λ = λ(π) ∈h∗
(deﬁned up to the action of W G) with the property that
(7.24)(c)
π(z) = ξG(z)(λ)
(z ∈ZG(g).
We call λ(π) the inﬁnitesimal character of π.
The notion of dominance that we need for the representation τ will be
deﬁned in terms of the inﬁnitesimal character of τ. To put the result in context,
here is a basic fact about how the Dolbeault cohomology construction of
Theorem 7.21 aﬀects inﬁnitesimal characters.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
317
Proposition 7.25. In the setting of Theorem 7.21, assume that the (q, L)-
representation (τ, V ) has inﬁnitesimal character λL(τ) ∈h∗. Write n =
dimC X, and ρ(u) ∈h∗for the restriction of the linear functional in (7.22)(e).
Then each G-representation H0,q(X, V) has inﬁnitesimal character λL −ρ(u),
and each G representation Hn,q(X, V) has inﬁnitesimal character λL + ρ(u).
The second assertion (about (n, q)-cohomology) is an immediate conse-
quence of the ﬁrst and (7.18)(b): tensoring a representation of L with 5n(g/q)∗
adds 2ρ(u) to its inﬁnitesimal character. The ﬁrst assertion is a version of
the Casselman-Osborne theorem relating the action of ZG(g) to cohomology.
(One can use the description (7.18)(b) of Dolbeault cohomology. The action
of ZG(g) in that picture is by diﬀerentiation on the left on functions on G.
Because we are considering central elements, this is equal to diﬀerentiation
on the right, which is where the (q, L)-cohomology is computed. We omit the
elementary details.)
Of course the weight λL in Proposition 7.25 is deﬁned only up to W L(l, h).
Deﬁnition 7.26. Suppose q = l + u is a Levi decomposition of a parabolic
subalgebra in the complex reductive Lie algebra g, and h ⊂l is a Cartan
subalgebra. A weight λ ∈h∗is called weakly dominant with respect to u if
for every coroot α∨corresponding to a root of h in u, ⟨α∨, λ⟩is not a strictly
negative real number. That is,
⟨α∨, λ⟩⩾0
or
⟨α∨, λ⟩is not real.
We say that λ is strictly dominant if (still for every such coroot)
⟨α∨, λ⟩> 0
or
⟨α∨, λ⟩is not real.
The set of coroots α∨for roots of h in u is permuted by W L(l, h), so these
condtions depend only on the W L(l, h)-orbit of λ.
The terminology here is far from standard. One common variant is to
require only that ⟨α∨, λ⟩never be a negative integer. That kind of hypothesis
is not suﬃcient for the assertions about unitarity in Theorem 7.27.
Theorem 7.27. In the setting of Proposition 7.25, assume also that λL+ρ(u)
is weakly dominant for u (Deﬁnition 7.26). Recall that Z = K/L ∩K ⊂X is
a compact complex subvariety, and set s = dimC(Z).
(1) Hn,q(X, V) = 0 unless q = s.
(2) If L = Lmax (Deﬁnition 6.5) and V is an irreducible representation of L,
then Hn,s(X, V) is irreducible or zero.
(3) If the Harish-Chandra module of V admits an invariant Hermitian form,
then the Harish-Chandra module of Hn,s(X, V) admits an invariant Her-
mitian form.
(4) If the Harish-Chandra module of V is unitary, then the Harish-Chandra
module of Hn,s(X, V) is unitary.

Suppose now that λL + ρ(u) is strictly dominant for u.
(5) If L = Lmax, then the representation V of L is irreducible if and only if
Hn,s(X, V) is irreducible or zero.
(6) The Harish-Chandra module of V admits an invariant Hermitian form if
and only if the Harish-Chandra module of Hn,s(X, V) admits an invariant
Hermitian form.
(7) The Harish-Chandra module of V is unitary if and only if the Harish-
Chandra module of Hn,s(X, V) is unitary.
This summarizes some of the main results of [Vog84], translated into the
language of Dolbeault cohomology using [Won99].
Theorem 7.27 is in many respects a valuable analogue of the Borel-Weil
theorem for noncompact groups. One annoying feature is that the statement
does not contain the Borel-Weil theorem as a special case. If G is compact,
then Theorem 7.27 concerns top degree cohomology and dominant V , whereas
Theorem 2.3 concerns degree zero cohomology and antidominant V . In order
to round out the motivation appropriately, here is an alternate version of
Theorem 2.3 addressing this incompatibility.
Theorem 7.28. (Borel-Weil, Harish-Chandra; see [HC56], [Ser59]). Suppose
K is a compact connected Lie group with maximal torus T; use the notation
of (2.1) and (2.2) above, and put n = dimC(K/T).
(1) The inﬁnitesimal character of the representation (µ, Cµ) of T is given by
the diﬀerential of dµ ∈t∗of µ.
(2) The weight dµ + ρ is strictly dominant (Deﬁnition 7.26) if and only if µ
is dominant in the sense of (2.2).
(3) The top degree Dolbeault cohomology Hn,n(K/T, Lµ) is non-zero if and
only if µ is dominant. In that case, the Dolbeault cohomology space is an
irreducible representation of K.
(4) This correspondence deﬁnes a bijection from dominant characters of T
onto K.
Here we say that µ is dominant if and only if the inverse character −µ is
antidominant (cf. (2.2)); that is, if and only if
⟨µ, α∨⟩⩾0
for every simple root α of T in K.
8 Compact Supports and Minimal Globalizations
Theorem 7.27 provides a large family of group representations with unitary
Harish-Chandra modules. It is entirely natural to look for something like a

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
319
pre-Hilbert space structure on these group representations, that might be com-
pleted to a unitary group representation. Theorem 7.21 guarantees that each
representation provided by Theorem 7.27 is the maximal globalization of its
Harish-Chandra module. As explained in the introduction, we will see in The-
orem 9.16 that maximal globalizations never admit G-invariant pre-Hilbert
space structures (unless they are ﬁnite-dimensional). We need something anal-
ogous to Theorem 7.21 that produces instead minimal globalizations. Because
of Deﬁnition 4.23, this means that we need to identify the dual of the topo-
logical vector space Hp,q(X, V). Let us ﬁrst examine this in the setting of
Deﬁnition 7.10, with V a holomorphic vector bundle on the complex manifold
X. The deﬁnition involves the topological vector spaces Ap,q(V) of smooth
(p, q)-forms on X with values in V (cf. (7.9)), and the Dolbeault operators
(8.1)(a)
Ap,q−1(V)
∂→Ap,q(V)
∂→Ap,q+1(V).
The ﬁrst point is to identify the topological duals of these three spaces. The
space C−∞
c
(W) of compactly supported distribution sections of a vector bun-
dle W is by deﬁnition the topological dual of the space C∞(W ⊗D), with D
the bundle of densities on the manifold. Because our manifold X is complex,
it is orientable; so the bundle of densities is just the bundle of top degree
diﬀerential forms on X. Top degree forms are (n, n)-forms (cf. (7.5)(b)), and
it follows easily that
(8.1)(b)
Ap,q(V)∗≃A(n−p,n−q),−∞
c
(V∗).
Any continuous linear map T : E →F between topological vector spaces
has a transpose tT : F ∗→E∗. The Dolbeault operators in (8.1)(a) therefore
give rise to transposes
(8.1)(c)
A(n−p,n−q−1),−∞
c
(V∗)
t∂
→A(n−p,n−q),−∞
c
(V∗)
t∂
→A(n−p,n−q+1),−∞
c
(V∗).
Calculating in coordinates shows that (up to a sign depending on p and q,
which according to [Ser55], page 19 is (−1)p+q+1) this transpose map “is”
just the ∂operator for the Dolbeault complex for V∗, applied to compactly
supported distribution sections. (The way this calculation is done is to regard
compactly supported smooth forms A(n−p,n−q+1),∞
c
(V∗) as linear functionals
on Ap,q(V), by pairing the V and V∗and integrating the resulting (compactly
supported smooth) (n, n)-form over X. Comparing the eﬀects of ∂and t∂on
A(n−p,n−q+1),∞
c
(V∗) now amounts to integrating by parts.)
Using this new complex, we can formulate an analogue of Deﬁnition 7.10.
Deﬁnition 8.2. Suppose X is a complex manifold of complex dimension n,
and V is a holomorphic vector bundle on X. The compactly supported (p, q)-
Dolbeault cohomology of X with coeﬃcients in V is by deﬁnition

320
David A. Vogan, Jr
Hp,q
c
(X, V) =
(kernel of ∂on A(p,q),−∞
c
(V))/(image of ∂from A(p,q−1),−∞
c
(V)).
At least if V is ﬁnite-dimensional, this is the ˇCech cohomology with compact
supports of X with coeﬃcients in the sheaf OΩp⊗V of holomorphic p-forms with
values in V. Just as in Proposition 7.19, there is a natural quotient topology
on this cohomology, and we can deﬁne
Hp,q
c,top(X, V) = maximal Hausdorﬀquotient of Hp,q
c
(X, V)
= kernel of ∂/closure of image of ∂.
In order to discuss transposes and duality, we need to recall a little about
topologies on the dual E∗of a complete locally convex space E. Details may
be found for example in [Tre67], Chapter 19. For any subset B ⊂E, and any
ϵ > 0, we can deﬁne
(8.3)(a)
Wϵ(B) = {λ ∈E∗| sup
e∈B
|λ(e)| ⩽ϵ} ⊂E∗.
This is a subset of E∗containing 0. The topologies we want on E∗are deﬁned
by requiring certain of these subsets to be open. The weak topology on E∗is
deﬁned to have neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of the sets Wϵ(B)
with B ⊂E ﬁnite. (Another way to say this is that the weak topology is
the coarsest one making all the evaluation maps λ →λ(e) continuous.) We
write E∗
wk for E∗endowed with the weak topology. (Treves writes E∗
σ, and
Bourbaki writes E∗
s; more precisely, each uses a prime instead of a star for the
continuous dual.) The topology of compact convergence on E∗is deﬁned to have
neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of the sets Wϵ(B) with B ⊂E
compact. We write E∗
cpt for this topological space; Treves writes E∗
c . The
strong topology is deﬁned to have neighborhood basis at the origin consisting
of the sets Wϵ(B) with B ⊂E bounded. (Recall that B is bounded if for every
neighborhood U of 0 in E, there is a scalar r ∈R so that B ⊂rU.) We write
E∗
str for this topological space; Treves and Bourbaki write E∗
b . Because a ﬁnite
set is automatically compact, and a compact set is automatically bounded, it
is clear that the topologies
(8.3)(b)
weak, compact convergence, strong
are listed in increasing strength; that is, each has more open sets than the
preceding ones. For any of these three topologies on dual spaces, the transpose
of a continuous linear map is continuous ([Tre67], Corollary to Proposition
19.5). If E is a Banach space, then the usual Banach space structure on E∗
deﬁnes the strong topology.
For most of the questions we will consider, statements about the strong
topology on E∗are the strongest and most interesting. Here is an example. We
can consider the double dual space (E∗)∗; what this is depends on the chosen

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
321
topology on E∗. Strengthening the topology on E∗allows more continuous
linear functionals, so
(8.4)(a)
(E∗
wk)∗⊂(E∗
cpt)∗⊂(E∗
str)∗.
Each of these spaces clearly includes E (the evaluation maps at an element of
E being continuous on E∗in all of our topologies). In fact
(8.4)(b)
(E∗
wk)∗= E
([Tre67], Proposition 35.1); this equality is a statement about sets, not topolo-
gies. Asking for similar statements for the other two topologies on E∗asks for
more; the most that one can ask is
Deﬁnition 8.5 . (see [Tre67], Deﬁnition 36.2). The (complete locally convex)
topological vector space E is called reﬂexive if the natural inclusion
E  →(E∗
str)∗
is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces.
For us, reﬂexivity will arise in the following way.
Deﬁnition 8.6. (see [Tre67], Deﬁnition 34.2). The (complete locally convex)
topological vector space E is called a Montel space if every closed and bounded
subset B ⊂E is compact.
Proposition 8.7. ([Tre67], Corollary to Proposition 36.9, and Corollary 3
to Proposition 50.2). A Montel space is reﬂexive. A complete nuclear space
is Montel. In particular, the analytic, smooth, distribution, and hyperfunction
globalizations of any ﬁnite-length Harish-Chandra module (cf. section 4) are
all reﬂexive.
Topological vector spaces that we deﬁne as dual spaces, like distribution
spaces and the maximal globalization, will usually be endowed with the strong
topology.
We are interested in the dual space of Dolbeault cohomology, which is a
quotient of subspaces of a simple space of forms. We therefore need to know
how to compute dual spaces of subspaces and quotients of topological vector
spaces.
Proposition 8.8. Suppose E is a complete locally convex topological vector
space, and M ⊂E is a closed subspace. Endow M with the subspace topology,
and E/M with the quotient topology (whose open sets are the images of the
open sets in E.) Write i: M →E for the inclusion, q: E →E/M for the
quotient map, and M ⊥⊂E∗for the subspace of linear functionals vanishing
on M.

322
David A. Vogan, Jr
(1) Every continuous linear functional λM on M (endowed with the subspace
topology) extends to a continuous linear functional λ on E. That is, the
transpose map
ti: E∗→M ∗
is surjective, with kernel equal to M ⊥.
(2) Suppose that E is reﬂexive. Then the vector space isomorphism
ti: E∗/M ⊥∼
→M ∗
is a homeomorphism from the quotient of the strong topology on E∗to the
strong topology on M ∗.
(3) If E/M is endowed with the quotient topology, then the continuous lin-
ear functionals are precisely those on E that vanish on M. That is, the
transpose map
tq: (E/M)∗→E∗
is injective, with image equal to M ⊥.
(4) Suppose that E and M ⊥are reﬂexive. Then the vector space isomorphism
tq: (E/M)∗∼
→M ⊥
is a homeomorphism from the strong topology on (E/M)∗onto the sub-
space topology on M ⊥induced by the strong topology on E∗.
The ﬁrst assertion is the Hahn-Banach Theorem (see for example [Tre67],
Chapter 18). The second may be found in [Bou87], Corollary to Theorem 1
in section IV.2.2. The third is more or less obvious. For the fourth, applying
the second assertion to M ⊥⊂E∗gives a homeomorphism
(M ⊥)∗
str ≃E/M.
Now take duals of both sides, and use the reﬂexivity of M ⊥.
Finally, we need a few general remarks about transpose maps (to be applied
to ∂). So suppose that
(8.9)(a)
T : E →F
is a continuous linear map of complete locally convex topological vector spaces,
and
(8.9)(b)
tT : F ∗→E∗
is its transpose. The kernel of T is a closed subspace of E, so the quotient
E/ ker T is a complete locally convex space in the quotient topology. The
image of T is a subspace of F, but not necessarily closed; its subspace topology
is locally convex, and the completion of im T may be identiﬁed with its closure
in F. We have a continuous bijection

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
323
(8.9)(c)
E/ ker T →im T,
but this need not be a homeomorphism. We now have almost obvious identi-
ﬁcations
ker tT = linear functionals on F vanishing on im T
(8.9)(d)
= (F/im T)∗⊂F ∗
im tT = linear functionals on E vanishing on ker T,
(8.9)(e)
and extending continuously from im T to F
= (im T)∗= (im T)∗⊂E∗
im tT = linear functionals on E vanishing on ker T
(8.9)(f)
= (E/ ker T)∗⊂E∗
The question of when these vector space isomorphisms respect topologies is
addressed by Proposition 8.8.
Lemma 8.10. In the setting of (8.9)(a), assume that the map (8.9)(c) is a
homeomorphism. Then tT has closed range.
This is immediate from the descriptions in (8.9)(e) and (8.9)(f), together
with the Hahn-Banach theorem. A famous theorem of Banach gives a suﬃcient
condition for (8.9)(c) to be a homeomorphism:
Theorem 8.11. ([Tre67], Theorem 17.1). In the setting of (8.9)(a), assume
that E and F are Fr´echet spaces. Then (8.9)(c) is a homeomorphism if and
only if T has closed range.
We can now say something about duals of cohomology spaces.
Proposition 8.12. Suppose that
E
T→F
S→G
is a complex of continuous linear maps of complete locally convex topological
vector spaces, so that S ◦T = 0. Deﬁne
H = ker S/ im T,
endowed with the quotient topology. This may be non-Hausdorﬀ, and we deﬁne
the maximal Hausdorﬀquotient
Htop = ker S/im T,
a complete locally convex topological vector space. Deﬁne the transpose complex

324
David A. Vogan, Jr
G∗
tS
→F ∗
tT
→E∗
with cohomology
tH = ker tT/ im tS
and maximal Hausdorﬀquotient
tHtop = ker tT/im tS.
(1) There is a continuous linear bijection
F ∗/im tS →(ker S)∗.
This is a homeomorphism if F is reﬂexive.
(2) The map in (1) restricts to a continuous linear bijection
tHtop = ker tT/im tS →(im T)⊥⊂(ker S)∗.
This is a homeomorphism if F is reﬂexive.
(3) There is a continuous linear bijection
H∗= (Htop)∗→(im T)⊥⊂(ker S)∗.
This is a homeomorphism if ker S and (im T)⊥are both reﬂexive.
(4) There is a linear bijection
H∗= (Htop)∗→tHtop.
This is a homeomorphism if F, its subspace ker S, and (im T)⊥⊂(ker S)∗
are all reﬂexive.
(5) Assume that E, F, and G are nuclear Fr´echet spaces, and that
H ≃Htop,
tH ≃tHtop
are Hausdorﬀ. The linear isomorphism
H∗= (Htop)∗≃tHtop
of (4) is a homeomorphism.
(6) Assume that E, F, and G are nuclear Fr´echet spaces, and that T and S
have closed range. Then tT and tS also have closed range, so the coho-
mology spaces
H ≃Htop,
tH ≃tHtop
are Hausdorﬀ. The linear isomorphism
H∗≃tH
of (4) is a homeomorphism.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
325
Proof.
Parts (1)–(3) are more or less immediate from Proposition 8.8, in
light of (8.9). Part (4) simply combines (2) and (3). For (5), we need to know
the reﬂexivity of the three spaces mentioned in (4). A subspace of a nuclear
space is nuclear, and therefore reﬂexive (Proposition 8.7). This shows that F
and ker S are reﬂexive. The dual of a nuclear Fr´echet space is nuclear ([Tre67],
Proposition 50.6), so (ker S)∗is nuclear; so its closed subspace (im T)⊥is nu-
clear, and therefore reﬂexive. For (6), the assertion about closed range follows
from Banach’s Theorem 8.11, and the fact that the cohomology is Hausdorﬀ
follows at once.
From these generalities in hand, we get immediately a description of the
topological dual of Dolbeault cohomology.
Theorem 8.13. (Serre [Ser55], Th´eor`eme 2). Suppose X is a complex man-
ifold of dimension n, and V is a smooth holomorphic nuclear Fr´echet vector
bundle on X. Write V∗for the topological dual bundle. Write Hp,q(X, V) for
the (p, q) Dolbeault cohomology of X with coeﬃcients in V, endowed with
the (possibly non-Hausdorﬀ) topological vector space structure deﬁned be-
fore Proposition 7.19, and Hp,q
top(X, V) for its maximal Hausdorﬀquotient.
Similarly deﬁne Hp,q
c
(X, V∗), the Dolbeault cohomology with compact support
(and generalized function coeﬃcients), and its maximal Hausdorﬀquotient
Hp,q
c,top(X, V∗) as in Deﬁnition 8.2. Then there is a natural topological isomor-
phism
Hp,q
top(X, V)∗≃Hn−p,n−q
c,top
(X, V∗).
If the Dolbeault cohomology operators for V have closed range, then the same
is true for the Dolbeault operators on compactly supported V∗-valued forms
with generalized function coeﬃcients, and
Hp,q(X, V)∗≃Hn−p,n−q
c
(X, V∗).
The main point is that the space of smooth sections of a smooth nuclear
Fr´echet bundle is a nuclear Fr´echet space; it is easy to imitate [Ser55], section
8, to deﬁne a countable collection of seminorms giving the topology. With
this fact in hand, Theorem 8.13 is a special case of Proposition 8.12, (4)–(6)
(together with (8.1) and Deﬁnition 8.2).
Corollary 8.14. (cf. Bratten [Bra97], Theorem on page 285). In the setting
of Deﬁnition 7.20, suppose X is the complex manifold G/L, and assume that
the admissible representation V is the minimal globalization of the underly-
ing (q, L ∩K)-module. Let Ap,q
c (X, V) be the Dolbeault complex for V with
generalized function coeﬃcients of compact support (cf. (8.1)(c)). Then the
∂operator has closed range, so that each of the corresponding coholomogy
spaces Hp,q
c
(X, V) carries a smooth representation of G (on the dual of a nu-
clear Fr´echet space). Each of these representations of G is admissible, and is
the minimal globalization of its underlying Harish-Chandra module.

326
David A. Vogan, Jr
This is immediate from Wong’s Theorem 7.21, Serre’s Theorem 8.13, and
the duality relationship between minimal and maximal globalizations (Deﬁ-
nitions 4.21 and 4.23). The theorem proved by Bratten is slightly diﬀerent:
he deﬁnes a “sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections” A(X, V), and proves
a parallel result for the sheaf cohomology with compact support on X with
coeﬃcients in A(X, V). When V is ﬁnite-dimensional, the two results are ex-
actly the same, since it is easy to check that Dolbeault cohomology (with
compactly supported generalized function coeﬃcients) computes sheaf coho-
mology in that case.
For inﬁnite-dimensional V , comparing Corollary 8.14 with Bratten’s re-
sults in [Bra97] is more diﬃcult. In these notes I have avoided many subtleties
by speaking only about the Dolbeault complex, and not about sheaf cohomol-
ogy. Part of the point of page 317 of Bratten’s paper is that I have in the
past (for example in Conjecture 6.11 of [Vog87]) glossed over the diﬃculty of
connecting sheaf and Dolbeault cohomology for inﬁnite-dimensional bundles.
In the same way, we can translate Theorem 7.27 into this setting. For con-
text, we should remark that Proposition 7.25 (computing inﬁnitesimal char-
acters of Dolbeault cohomology representations) applies equally to Dolbeault
cohomology with compact support. The weight λL −ρ(u) appearing in the
next corollary is therefore the inﬁnitesimal character of the representation
H0,r
c
(X, V).
Corollary 8.15. In the setting of Deﬁnition 7.20, recall that Z = K/L ∩
K is an s-dimensional compact complex submanifold of the n-dimensional
complex manifold X = G/L. Write r = n −s for the codimension of Z in
X. Assume that V is an admissible (q, L)-module of inﬁnitesimal character
λL ∈h∗(cf. (7.24)), and that V is the minimal globalization of the underlying
(q, L ∩K)-module. Assume that λL −ρ(u) is weakly antidominant for u; that
is, that −λL + ρ(u) is weakly dominant. Then
(1) H0,q
c
(X, V) = 0 unless q = r.
(2) If L = Lmax (Deﬁnition 6.5) and V is an irreducible representation of L,
then H0,r
c
(X, V) is irreducible or zero.
(3) If the Harish-Chandra module of V admits an invariant Hermitian form,
then the Harish-Chandra module of H0,r
c
(X, V) admits an invariant Her-
mitian form.
(4) If the Harish-Chandra module of V is unitary, then the Harish-Chandra
module of H0,r
c
(X, V) is unitary.
Suppose now that λL −ρ(u) is strictly antidominant for u.
(5) If L = Lmax, then the representation V of L is irreducible if and only if
H0,r
c
(X, V) is irreducible or zero.
(6) The Harish-Chandra module of V admits an invariant Hermitian form if
and only if the Harish-Chandra module of H0,r
c
(X, V) admits an invariant
Hermitian form.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
327
(7) The Harish-Chandra module of V is unitary if and only if the Harish-
Chandra module of H0,r
c
(X, V) is unitary.
These statements follow immediately from Theorem 7.27 and Theorem
8.13.
We will see in section 9 that the Hermitian forms of Corollary 8.15(6)
automatically extend continuously to H0,r
c
(X, V).
To conclude this section, notice that in the setting of the Borel-Weil Theo-
rem (Theorem 2.3), we have X = Z = K/T, so r = 0; Theorem 2.3 is therefore
“compatible” with Corollary 8.15.
9 Invariant Bilinear Forms and Maps between
Representations
In Theorem 7.21 and Corollary 8.14, we have identiﬁed many representations
with spaces related to smooth functions and distributions on manifolds. In
this section, we will use these realizations to describe Hermitian forms on the
representations. This is a three-step process. First, we will see (in Deﬁnition
9.6) how to
(9.1)(a) understand a Hermitian form on one representation as a special
kind of linear map between two representations.
Describing Hermitian forms therefore becomes a special case of describing
linear maps. For the representations we are considering, this amount to de-
scribing linear maps between function spaces. The second step (Theorem 9.8)
is to
(9.1)(b) understand spaces of linear maps between function spaces as topo-
logical tensor products of function spaces.
The third step (which we will deal with more or less case by case) is to
(9.1)(c) understand tensor products of function spaces as function spaces
on a product.
The second and third steps are closely connected to the Schwartz kernel
theorem for distributions, and rely on the theory of nuclear spaces that
Grothendieck developed to explain and generalize Schwartz’s theorem.
Before embarking on the technical details, we record the elementary ideas
that we will be trying to generalize. So suppose for a moment that A and B
are ﬁnite sets, say with n elements and m elements respectively. Deﬁne
(9.2)(a)
VA = {complex-valued functions on A} ≃Cn,
(9.2)(b)
V ∗
A = {complex-valued measures on A} ≃Cn,

328
David A. Vogan, Jr
and similarly for B. The space V ∗
A is naturally identiﬁed with the dual space
of VA (as the notation indicates), by
λ(f) =

A
f dλ =

a∈A
f(a)λ(a);
in the second formula, the measure λ has been identiﬁed with the linear combi-
nation of delta functions (unit masses at points of A)  λ(a)δa. For motivating
the ideas above, we are meant to be thinking of VA as the space of smooth
functions on the manifold A, and of V ∗
A as distributions on A. In this setting,
a version of (9.1)(b) is
(9.2)(c)
HomC(V ∗
A, VB) ≃VA ⊗VB.
The natural map from right to left is
f ⊗g →Tf⊗g,
Tf⊗g(λ) = λ(f)g.
A version of (9.1)(c) is
(9.2)(d)
VA ⊗VB ≃VA×B.
The composite map
(9.2)(e)
VA×B
∼
→HomC(V ∗
A, VB)
is
h →Kh,
[Kh(λ)](b) =

A
h(x, b) dλ(x).
The operator Kh is a kernel operator, and (9.2)(e) is an example of the
Schwartz kernel theorem.
One lesson that can be extracted even from this very simple example is
that some of the easiest linear maps to understand are those going from spaces
of distributions to spaces of functions. By rearranging the example slightly,
we could also have found a nice description of the linear maps from a space
of functions to a space of distributions.
As a second kind of warming up, here are two versions of the Schwartz
kernel theorem that we will be imitating in the steps (9.1)(b) and (9.1)(c)
above. In order to state these theorems, we will follow Schwartz and write
D′(M) for the space of distributions on the smooth manifold M with arbitrary
support; that is, the continuous dual of C∞
c (M). (Elsewhere we have written
this as C−∞(M, D), with D the bundle of smooth densities on M.)
Theorem 9.3. (Schwartz kernel theorem; see [Tre67], Theorem 51.7). Sup-
pose X and Y are smooth manifolds. Then the space L(C∞
c (Y ), D′(X)) (of
continuous linear maps from compactly supported smooth functions on Y to
distributions on X) may be identiﬁed with D′(X×Y ). The identiﬁcation sends
a distribution h on X × Y to the kernel operator

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
329
Kh : C∞
0 (Y ) →D′(X),
[Kh(φ)](ψ) = h(ψ ⊗φ).
Here on the left we are describing the distribution Kh(φ) by evaluating it on
a test function ψ ∈C∞
c (X). On the right, we regard ψ ⊗φ as a test function
on X × Y (to which the distribution h may be applied) by
(ψ ⊗φ)(x, y) = ψ(x)φ(y).
Formally, the kernel operator in the theorem may be written
Kh(φ)(x) =

Y
h(x, y)φ(y).
This equation makes sense as written if h = H(x, y)dx dy, with dx and dy
smooth measures on X and Y , and H a continuous function on X × Y . In
this case
Kh(φ) = f(x) dx,
f(x) =

Y
H(x, y)φ(y) dy.
Again following Schwartz, write E′(M) for the space of distributions with
compact support (what we have written elsewhere as C−∞
c
(M, D).) For us a
useful variant of the kernel theorem will be
Theorem 9.4. ([Tre67], page 533). Suppose X and Y are smooth manifolds.
Then the space L(E′(Y ), C∞
c (X)) (of continuous linear maps from compactly
supported distributions on Y to smooth functions on X) may be identiﬁed with
C∞(X × Y ). The identiﬁcation sends h ∈C∞(X × Y ) to the kernel operator
Kh : E′(Y ) →C∞(X),
[Kh(λ)](x) = λ(h(x, ·)).
We begin now with the machinery of linear maps and invariant Hermitian
forms.
Deﬁnition 9.5. Suppose E and F are complete locally convex topological
vector spaces. Write L(E, F) for the vector space of continuous linear maps
from E to F. There are a number of important topologies on L(E, F), but (by
virtue of omitting proofs) we will manage with only one: the strong topology
of uniform convergence on bounded subsets of E (cf. [Tre67], page 337). (The
deﬁnition is a straightforward generalization of the case F = C described in
(8.3) above.) Write Lstr(E, F) for the topological vector space of linear maps
with this topology. This is a locally convex space, and it is complete if E is
bornological; this holds in particular if E is Fr´echet or the dual of a nuclear
Fr´echet space.
Deﬁnition 9.6. Suppose E is a complete locally convex topological vector
space. The Hermitian dual Eh of E consists of the continuous conjugate-linear
functionals on E:
Eh = {λ: E →C, λ(av + bw) = aλ(v) + bλ(w)
(a, b ∈C, v, w ∈E)}.

330
David A. Vogan, Jr
These are the complex conjugates of the continuous linear functionals on E, so
there is a conjugate-linear identiﬁcation E∗≃Eh. We use this identiﬁcation
to topologize Eh (cf. (8.3)); most often we will be interested in the strong
topology Eh
str. In particular, we use the strong topology to deﬁne the double
Hermitian dual, and ﬁnd a natural continuous linear embedding
E  →(Eh)h,
which is a topological isomorphism exactly when E is reﬂexive.
Any continuous linear map T : E →F has a Hermitian transpose
T h : F h →Eh,
T h(λ)(e) = λ(Te).
The map T →T h is conjugate-linear. In case S ∈L(E, F h), we will also
write
Sh ∈L(F, Eh)
for the restriction of the Hermitian transpose to F ⊂(F h)h.
A Hermitian pairing between E and F is a separately continuous map
⟨, ⟩: E × F →C
that is linear in the ﬁrst variable and conjugate linear in the second. It is
immediate that such pairings are naturally in bijection with L(E, F h). The
correspondence is
⟨, ⟩T
↔
T : E →F h,
T(e)(f) = ⟨e, f⟩T .
In case E = F, we say that the pairing is a Hermitian form on E if in
addition
⟨e, f⟩= ⟨f, e⟩.
In terms of the corresponding linear map T ∈L(E, Eh), the condition is
T = T h. (Here we restrict T h to E ⊂(Eh)h.) The Hermitian form is said to
be positive deﬁnite if
⟨e, e⟩> 0, all non-zero e ∈E.
Of course one can speak about bilinear pairings between E and F, which
correspond to L(E, F ∗).
For tensor products we will make only a few general remarks, referring for
details to [Tre67].
Deﬁnition 9.7. Suppose E and F are complete locally convex topological
vector spaces. A “topological tensor product” of E and F is deﬁned by imposing
on the algebraic tensor product E⊗F a locally convex topology, and completing
with respect to that topology. We will be concerned only with the projective
tensor product. If p is a seminorm on E and q a seminorm on F, then we
can deﬁne a seminorm p ⊗q on E ⊗F by

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
331
p ⊗q(x) =
inf
x= ei⊗fi

i
p(ei)q(fi)
(x ∈E ⊗F).
The projective topology on E ⊗F is that deﬁned by the family of seminorms
p ⊗q, where p and q vary over seminorms deﬁning the topologies of E and F.
The projective tensor product of E and F is the completion in this topology;
it is written
E ⊗πF.
A characteristic property of this topology is that for any complete locally convex
topological vector space G, L(E ⊗πF, G) may be identiﬁed with G-valued jointly
continuous bilinear forms on E × F.
Here is Grothendieck’s general solution to the problem posed as (9.1)(b)
above.
Theorem 9.8. ([Tre67], Proposition 50.5). Suppose E and F are complete
locally convex topological vector spaces. Assume that
(1) E is barreled ([Tre67], page 346).
(2) E∗is nuclear and complete.
(Both of these conditions are automatic if E is nuclear Fr´echet or the dual of
a nuclear Fr´echet space.) Then the natural isomorphism
E∗⊗F ≃ﬁnite rank continuous linear maps from E to F
extends to a topological isomorphism
E∗⊗π F ≃Lstr(E, F).
To translate this into representation-theoretic language, we need a lemma.
Lemma 9.9. Suppose X1 and X2 are Harish-Chandra modules of ﬁnite
length for reductive groups G1 and G2.
(1) X1 ⊗X2 is a Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite length for G1 × G2.
(2) The minimal globalization of X1 ⊗X2 is the projective tensor product of
the minimal globalizations of X1 and X2:
Xω
1 ⊗π Xω
2 ≃(X1 ⊗X2)ω.
(3) The smooth globalization of X1 ⊗X2 is the projective tensor product of
the smooth globalizations of X1 and X2:
X∞
1 ⊗π X∞
2
≃(X1 ⊗X2)∞.
(4) The distribution globalization of X1 ⊗X2 is the projective tensor product
of the distribution globalizations of X1 and X2:
X−∞
1
⊗π X−∞
2
≃(X1 ⊗X2)−∞.

332
David A. Vogan, Jr
(5) The maximal globalization of X1 ⊗X2 is the projective tensor product of
the maximal globalizations of X1 and X2:
X−ω
1
⊗π X−ω
2
≃(X1 ⊗X2)−ω.
Proof.
The assertion in (1) is elementary. For the rest, ﬁx Hilbert space
globalizations XHilb
i
, with orthonormal bases {em
i } of Ki-ﬁnite vectors. Then
XHilb
1
⊗π XHilb
2
is a Hilbert space globalization of X1 ⊗X2, with orthonor-
mal basis {em
1 ⊗en
2}. (The projective tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is
topologically the same as the Hilbert space tensor product.) Now all of the
canonical globalizations in sight are sequence spaces. For example,
X∞
1
=
D
amem
1 | am ∈C, |am · mk| ⩽Ck, all k ⩾0
E
(cf. Theorem 4.18). The assertion in (3) amounts to the statement that the
projective tensor product of the space of rapidly decreasing sequences on N
with itself is the space of rapidly decreasing sequences on N×N. This is an easy
exercise (using the seminorms implicit in the deﬁnition of rapidly decreasing;
compare [Tre67], Theorem 51.5). The remaining cases can be treated in exactly
the same way.
Here is an abstract representation-theoretic version of the Schwartz kernel
theorem.
Corollary 9.10. Suppose X1 and X2 are Harish-Chandra modules of ﬁnite
length for G. Write Xdual
1
for the K-ﬁnite dual Harish-Chandra module, X∞
1
for its smooth globalization, and so on as in section 4.
(1) There is a natural identiﬁcation
HomK × K-ﬁnite(X1, X2) ≃Xdual
1
⊗X2.
This is a Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite length for G × G.
(2) There is a natural identiﬁcation (as representations of G × G)
Lstr(Xω
1 , X−ω
2
) ≃(Xdual
1
)−ω ⊗π X−ω
2
≃(Xdual
1
⊗X2)−ω.
That is, the space of continuous linear maps from the minimal globaliza-
tion of X1 to the maximal globalization of X2 may be identiﬁed with the
maximal globalization of a Harish-Chandra module for G × G.
(3) There is a natural identiﬁcation (as representations of G × G)
Lstr(X∞
1 , X−∞
2
) ≃(Xdual
1
)−∞⊗π X−∞
2
≃(Xdual
1
⊗X2)−∞.
That is, the space of continuous linear maps from the smooth globalization
of X1 to the distribution globalization of X2 may be identiﬁed with the
distribution globalization of a Harish-Chandra module for G × G.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
333
Proof.
The assertions in (1) are elementary. The ﬁrst isomorphism
in (2) is Theorem 9.8 (bearing in mind the fact from Deﬁnition 4.23 that
(Xω)∗= (Xdual)−ω). The second is Lemma 9.9(2). Part (3) is identical.
We want to express this corollary more geometrically in the presence of
geometric realizations of the representations Xi. As a warmup, we consider
the situation of Proposition 5.11.
Corollary 9.11. Suppose P1 and P2 are parabolic subgroups of the reductive
groups G1 and G2 (Deﬁnition 5.1), and that Ei is an admissible Harish-
Chandra module for Pi (Deﬁnition 5.6). Write
Xi = (IndGi
Pi )Ki(Ei)
for the induced Harish-Chandra module for Gi as in (5.12), and describe their
various canonical globalizations as in (5.15).
(1) The space Lstr(Xω
1 , X−ω
2
) of maps from the minimal globalization to the
maximal one may be identiﬁed with
(IndG1×G2
P1×P2 )−ω(Lstr(Eω
1 , E−ω
2
)),
the space of hyperfunction sections of the bundle on (G1 × G2)/(P1 × P2)
induced by the corresponding space of linear maps between representations
of Pi.
(2) The space Lstr(X∞
1 , X−∞
2
) of maps from the smooth globalization to the
distribution one may be identiﬁed with
(IndG1×G2
P1×P2 )−∞(Lstr(E∞
1 , E−∞
2
)),
the space of distribution sections of the bundle on (G1 × G2)/(P1 × P2)
induced by the corresponding space of linear maps between representations
of Pi.
The second observation was ﬁrst made by Bruhat, who used it to begin
the analysis of reducibility of induced representations. Here is the idea.
Corollary 9.12. (Bruhat [Bru56], Th´eor`eme 6;1). In the setting of Corol-
lary 9.11, assume that G1 = G2 = G. The the space of G-intertwining op-
erators from X∞
1
to X−∞
2
may be identiﬁed with the space of G∆-invariant
generalized function sections of the bundle on (G × G)/(P1 × P2) induced by
Lstr(E∞
1 , E−∞
2
). This space can in turn be identiﬁed with the space of contin-
uous linear maps
HomP1(E∞
1 , X−∞
2
),
or with
HomP2(X∞
1 , E−∞
2
).

334
David A. Vogan, Jr
The ﬁrst displayed formula (which is a version of Frobenius reciprocity)
identiﬁes intertwining operators with distributions on G/P2 having a certain
transformation property under P1 on acting on the left. Bruhat proceeds to
analyze such distributions using the (ﬁnite) decomposition of G/P1 into P2
orbits; equivalently, using the (ﬁnite) decomposition of (G×G)/(P1 ×P2) into
G∆orbits.
Here is the corresponding result for Dolbeault cohomology.
Corollary 9.13. Suppose q1 and q2 are very nice parabolic subalgebras for
the reductive groups G1 and G2, with Levi factors L1 and L2 (Deﬁnition 6.5),
and that Ei is an admissible (qi, Li ∩Ki)-module (Deﬁnition 7.20). Set
ni = dimC Yi = Gi/Li.
Write Eω
1 for the minimal globalization of E1, and E−ω
2
for the maximal
globalization of E2. These deﬁne holomorphic vector bundles
Eω
1 →Y1 = G1/L1,
E−ω
2
→Y2 = G2/L2.
Deﬁne
Xp,ω
1
= H0,n1−p
c
(Y1, Eω
1 )
(Deﬁnition 8.2), the compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology of Y1 with co-
eﬃcients in Eω
1 . This is an admissible representation of G1, the minimal glob-
alization of the underlying Harish-Chandra module Xp,K1
1
(Corollary 8.14).
Similarly, deﬁne
Xq,−ω
2
= Hn2,q(Y2, E−ω
2
)
(Deﬁnition 8.2), the Dolbeault cohomology of Y2 with coeﬃcients in E−ω
2
. This
is an admissible representation of G2, the maximal globalization of the under-
lying Harish-Chandra module Xq,K2
2
(Theorem 7.21).
(1) The space of continuous linear maps
E−ω
12 = Lstr(Eω
1 , E−ω
2
)
is an admissible (q1 ×q2, L1 ×L2)-representation (Deﬁnition 7.20), and is
the maximal globalization of its underlying Harish-Chandra module. Write
E−ω
12 →Y1 × Y2
for the corresponding holomorphic bundle.
(2) There is a natural identiﬁcation
Lstr(X·,ω
1 , X·,−ω
2
) ≃Hn1+n2,·(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ).
Here in each case the dot · indicates that one should sum over the possible
indices in question. More precisely,

p+q=m
Lstr(Xp,ω
1
, Xq,−ω
2
) ≃Hn1+n2,m(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
335
Proof.
The cohomology on Y1×Y2 is computed using a complex of forms
An1+n2,m(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ).
The ﬁbers of E−ω
12 are tensor products
(Edual
1
)−ω ⊗E−ω
2
(Corollary 9.10(2)). Using this fact, the group-equivariant description of forms
in Proposition 7.17, and standard ideas about tensor products of function
spaces (cf. [Tre67], Theorem 51.6), one can prove that
An1+n2,m(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ) ≃

p+q=m
An1,p(Y1, Edual,−ω
1
) ⊗π An2,q(Y2, E−ω
2
)
That is, the complex for Dolbeault cohomology on Y1 × Y2 is the projective
tensor product of the complexes for Y1 and Y2. Now one needs a K¨unneth
formula for tensor products of nice complexes. (Recall that we know from
Wong’s Theorem 7.21 that the ∂operators are topological homomorphisms,
and all the spaces here are nuclear Fr´echet.) We leave this step as an exercise
for the reader.
Corollary 9.14. In the setting of Corollary 9.13, assume that G1 = G2 = G.
Then the space of G-intertwining operators

p+q=m
HomG(Xp,ω
1
, Xq,−ω
2
)
may be identiﬁed with the space of G∆-invariant Dolbeault cohomology classes
in Hn1+n2,m(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ).
Because the coeﬃcient bundle E−ω
12 is a tensor product, the Dolbealt co-
homology on Y1 × Y2 has a natural quadruple grading; that is, each term of
the bidegree has a bidegree, reﬂecting the degrees on Y1 and Y2. We could
therefore write
(9.15)
HomG(Xp,ω
1
, Xq,−ω
2
) ≃H(n1,n2),(p,q)(Y1 × Y2, E−ω
12 ).
Just as in the setting of Corollary 9.12, the group G∆acts on Y1 ×Y2 with
ﬁnitely many orbits. Everything about the analysis of this setting is slightly
more complicated than in Corollary 9.12; even the Frobenius reciprocity iso-
morphisms described there are replaced by spectral sequences. Nevertheless
one should be able to ﬁnd some reasonable and interesting statements. We
leave this task to the reader (with some suggestions in section 10).
It is now a simple matter to apply this result to the description of invariant
Hermitian forms on Dolbeault cohomology representations. We begin with
some general facts about Hermitian forms on representations.

336
David A. Vogan, Jr
Theorem 9.16. Suppose XK is a Harish-Chandra module of ﬁnite length
for G. Write Xdual,K for the K-ﬁnite dual Harish-Chandra module, and
Xherm,K for the K-ﬁnite Hermitian dual; this is the same real vector space
as Xdual,K, with the conjugate complex structure. Write Xω and (Xherm)ω
for the minimal globalizations, and so on as in section 4.
(1) The algebraic Hermitian dual of X is isomorphic to (Xherm)−K. Accord-
ingly there is a natural identiﬁcation
Hom(X, (Xherm)−K) ≃(Hermitian pairings on X).
The conjugate linear automorphism of order two given by Hermitian trans-
pose corresponds to interchanging variables and taking complex conjugate
on Hermitian pairings. Hermitian forms on X correspond to the ﬁxed
points of this automorphism. We have
Homg,K(X, (Xherm)−K) ≃(invariant Hermitian pairings on X).
Any linear map on the left must take values in (Xherm)K.
(2) There is a natural identiﬁcation of the continuous Hermitian dual
(Xω)h = (Xherm)−ω.
Accordingly there is a natural identiﬁcation
Lstr(Xω, (Xherm)−ω) ≃(continuous Hermitian pairings on Xω.)
This restricts to
HomG,cont(Xω, (Xherm)−ω) ≃(invariant Hermitian pairings on Xω).
Any linear map on the left must take values in (Xherm)ω.
(3) There is a natural identiﬁcation of the continuous Hermitian dual
(X∞)h = (Xherm)−∞.
Accordingly there is a natural identiﬁcation
Lstr(X∞, (Xherm)−∞) ≃(continuous Hermitian pairings on X∞).
This restricts to
HomG,cont(X∞, (Xherm)−∞) ≃(invariant Hermitian pairings on X∞).
Any linear map on the left must take values in (Xherm)∞.
(4) Restriction of linear transformations deﬁnes isomorphisms of the (ﬁnite-
dimensional) spaces
HomG,cont(X∞, (Xherm)−∞) ≃HomG,cont(Xω, (Xherm)−ω)
≃Homg,K(X, (Xherm)−K).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
337
(5) Any (g, K)-invariant Hermitian form on the admissible Harish-Chandra
module XK extends continuously to the minimal and smooth globalizations
Xω and X∞.
(6) Assume that XK is irreducible. Then XK admits a non-zero invariant
Hermitian form if and only if XK is equivalent to the (irreducible) Harish-
Chandra module (Xherm)K. Such a form has a unique continuous exten-
sion to Xω and to X∞; it has no continous extension to X−∞or to X−ω
unless XK is ﬁnite-dimensional.
In all cases “continuous” Hermitian pairing means “separately continu-
ous.” It turns out that the separately continuous forms here are automatically
continuous; see for example [Tre67], Theorem 41.1.)
Proof.
All the assertions in (1) are easy. The ﬁrst assertion in (2)
is essentially Deﬁnition 4.23 (with some complex conjugations inserted). The
second then follows from the remarks in Deﬁnition 9.7. The third isomorphism
is an obvious consequence. The ﬁnal assertion in (2) is a special case of the
“functoriality of minimal globalization” established in [Sch85]. Part (3) is
proved in exactly the same way, using the Casselman-Wallach results. For part
(4), we can change −∞to ∞, −ω to ω, and −K to K by parts (1), (2), and
(3). Then these isomorphisms are again “functoriality of globalization.” Part
(5) restates (4) using the facts in (2) and (3). For part (6), the irreducibility
of (Xherm)K is elementary, so the assertion about forms on XK amounts to
(1) and Schur’s lemma. The existence of extensions to Xω and to X∞is (5).
For the non-existence of extensions to (say) X−∞, one can prove exactly
as in (3) that invariant Hermitian pairings on X−∞correspond to continuous
G-equivariant linear maps
HomG,cont(X−∞, (Xherm)∞).
A G-map of admissible group representations must restrict to a (g, K)-map
of the underlying Harish-Chandra modules; and in our setting that map (if
it is non-zero) has to be an isomorphism. From section 4, it follows that a
non-zero map T must restrict to an isomorphism
T ∞: X∞→(Xherm)∞.
The sequence space descriptions of the globalizations in section 4 show that
such an isomorphism cannot extend continuously to X−∞: a sequence (xµ)
would necessarily (by continuity) map to the sequence (T ∞(xµ)). This se-
quence is rapidly decreasing if and only if (xµ) is rapidly decreasing (by the
Casselman-Wallach uniqueness theorem for smooth globalization). If XK is
inﬁnite-dimensional, then X−∞must include slowly increasing sequences (xµ)
that are not rapidly decreasing, so T(xµ) cannot be deﬁned. The argument
for X−ω is identical.
We turn ﬁnally to Hermitian forms on Dolbeault cohomology representa-
tions. So suppose q = l+u is a very nice parabolic subalgebra for the reductive
group G, with Levi factor L. Put

(9.17)(a)
Y = G/L,
n = dimC Y.
Suppose E is an admissible (q, L∩K)-module (Deﬁnition 7.20), with minimal
globalization Eω. Deﬁne
(9.17)(b)
Eherm = L ∩K-ﬁnite Hermitian dual of E,
(cf. Deﬁnition 9.6); this is naturally an admissible (q, L∩K)-module. By The-
orem 9.16(2), the maximal globalization of Eherm is precisely the (continuous)
Hermitian dual of Eω:
(9.17)(c)
(Eherm)−ω ≃(Eω)h.
Deﬁne
(9.17)(d)
F = HomL ∩K × L ∩K-ﬁnite(E, Eherm) ≃Edual ⊗Eh,
a space of Hermitian forms on E (cf. Deﬁnition 9.6 and Corollary 9.10(1)).
This is an admissible (q×q, L∩K ×L∩K)-module. Its maximal globalization
is
(9.17)(e)
F −ω = Lstr(Eω, (Eω)h) ≃(Edual)−ω ⊗π (Eh)−ω,
the space of (separately continuous) Hermitian pairings on the minimal glob-
alization Eω (cf. Theorem 9.16(2) and Corollary 9.10(2)). The space F −ω
carries a conjugate-linear involution that we will write as bar. On Hermitian
pairings τ, it is deﬁned by
(9.17)(f)
τ(e, f) = τ(f, e).
On linear maps, it is Hermitian transpose (Deﬁnition 9.6). In the tensor prod-
uct (the last isomorphism of (9.17)(e)) it simply interchanges the factors.
(This makes sense because Eh is the same real vector space as Edual, with
the opposite complex structure. With respect to the q × q action, we have
(9.17)(g)
(X, Y ) · τ = (Y , X) · τ
(X ∈q, Y ∈q).
There is a similar formula for the L × L representation.
Corollary 9.18. In the setting of (9.17), deﬁne G representations
Xp,ω = H0,n−p
c
(Y, Eω),
which are minimal globalizations of the underlying Harish-Chandra modules
Xp. Write Y op for G/L with the opposite complex structure (deﬁned by q
instead of q).
(1) The Hermitian dual of Xp,ω is
(Xp,h)−ω ≃Hn,p(Y op, (Eh)−ω).

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
339
(2) The space of separately continuous Hermitian pairings on Xp,ω is
H(n,n),(p,p)(Y × Y op, F−ω);
here the coeﬃcient bundle is induced by the representation F −ωof (9.17)(e).
(3) The space of G-invariant Hermitian forms on Xp,ω may be identiﬁed with
the space of G∆-invariant real Dolbeault cohomology classes in
H(n,n),(p,p)(Y × Y op, F−ω).
Almost all of this is a formal consequence of Corollary 9.14, Theorem 9.16,
and the deﬁnitions. One point that requires comment is the reference to “real”
cohomology classes in (3). Suppose X is any complex manifold, and Xop the
opposite complex manifold: this is the same as X as a smooth manifold, and
the holomorphic vector ﬁelds on one are the antiholomorphic vector ﬁelds on
the other. Complex conjugation carries (p, q)-forms on X to (p, q) forms on
Xop, and respects ∂. Therefore complex conjugation deﬁnes a conjugate-linear
isomorphism of order two
Hp,q(X) ≃Hp,q(Xop).
Beginning with this idea, and the automorphism bar of F −ω, one ﬁnds a
conjugate linear isomorphism of order two
H(a,b),(c,d)(Y × Y op, F−ω) →H(b,a),(d,c)(Y × Y op, F−ω).
(The terms like (a, b) in the bidegree are transposed when we use the isomor-
phism
(Y × Y op)op ≃Y × Y op,
which interchanges the factors.) A “real” cohomology class is one ﬁxed by this
isomorphism.
What do the identiﬁcations of Hermitian pairings in Corollary 9.18 look
like? An element

is represented by a compactly supported (0, n−p)-form v on Y , with values in
the bundle Eω. (I will write v as if it were a smooth function, even though it
actually has generalized function coeﬃcients.) We can identify v as a function

Suppose now that τ is a cohomology class as in Corollary 9.18(2). A repre-
sentative τ may be identiﬁed with a smooth map

with F −ω the space of continuous Hermitian pairings on Eω. Consequently
the formal product τ ∧(v ⊗w) is a (2n, 2n) form on Y × Y op taking values in
(9.19)(e)
F −ω ⊗Eω ⊗Eω
At each point of G, we can apply the form value to the two vector values:
(9.19)(f)
F −ω ⊗Eω ⊗Eω →C,
φ ⊗e ⊗f →φ(e, f).
This deﬁnes a complex-valued (2n, 2n)-form that we might sensibly denote
τ(v, w). This form is compactly supported because v and w are. It has gen-
eralized function coeﬃcients, meaning that it is deﬁned as an element of the
dual space of smooth functions on Y × Y op. We may therefore integrate it
(that is, pair it with the function 1) and deﬁne
(9.19)(g)
⟨v, w⟩τ =

Y ×Y op τ(v, w)
This is the identiﬁcation in Corollary 9.18(2).
Here is a construction of unitary representations.
Corollary 9.20. In the setting of Deﬁnition 7.20, recall that Z = K/L ∩
K is an s-dimensional compact complex submanifold of the n-dimensional
complex manifold X = G/L. Write r = n −s for the codimension of Z in X.
Assume that V (2) is an irreducible unitary representation of L of inﬁnitesimal
character λL ∈h∗(cf. (7.24)). Write V ω for the subspace of analytic vectors
in V (2). Regard V ω as a (q, L)-module by making u act by zero, and let Vω be
the corresponding holomorphic bundle on X. Assume that λL −ρ(u) is weakly
antidominant for u; that is, that −λL + ρ(u) is weakly dominant. Then
(1) H0,q
c
(X, Vω) = 0 unless q = r.
(2) If L = Lmax (Deﬁnition 6.5), then H0,r
c
(X, V) is irreducible or zero.
(3) The representation H0,r
c
(X, Vω) admits a natural continuous positive def-
inite invariant Hermitian form. Completing H0,r
c
(X, Vω) with respect to
this form deﬁnes a unitary representation of G.
Suppose in addition that λL −ρ(u) is strictly antidominant for u. Then
H0,r
c
(X, Vω) is not zero.
This result is immediate from Corollary 9.18 and Corollary 8.15.

10 Open Questions
My original goal in these notes was to write down (explicitly and geomet-
rically) the pre-unitary structures provided by Corollary 9.20. According to
Corollary 9.18, this amounts to
Question 10.1. In the setting of Corollary 9.20, write F ω for the space of
continuous Hermitian pairings on the analytic vectors V ω for the unitary
representation V (2) of L. Regard F ω as a smooth L × L representation, and
write Fω for the corresponding holomorphic bundle on Y × Y op. Corollaries
9.18 and 9.20 provide a distinguished G∆-invariant Dolbeault cohomology
class in
H(n,n),(s,s)(Y × Y op, Fω),
with s the complex dimension of K/L ∩K. This class is non-zero if λL −ρ(u)
is strictly anti-dominant for u. The problem is to give a simple geometric
description of this class; perhaps to write down a representative (2n, 2s) form.
The space of forms F ω contains a distinguished line corresponding to the
invariant form on V ω. The diﬃculty is that this form is only L∆-invariant, so
the line does not deﬁne a one-dimensional subbundle of Fω (except along the
diagonal in Y × Y op).
In the case of Verma modules, construction of the Shapovalov form de-
pends entirely on understanding the universal mapping property of Verma
modules. In our setting, Question 10.1 should be related to questions of Frobe-
nius reciprocity for Dolbeault cohomology representations, and these are in
any case of interest in their own right.
Question 10.2. Suppose E is an admissible Harish-Chandra module for L,
with maximal globalization E−ω and minimal globalization Eω. Regard these
representations of L as (q, L)-modules, by making u act by zero. If X is any
smooth admissible representation of G, we would like to calculate
HomG(X, Hn,p(Y, Eω)).
This should be related to (in fact equal to if L is compact)
HomL(Hn−p(u, X), E−ω).
We will oﬀer a more precise statement in Conjecture 10.3. What appears in
the second formula is the cohomology of the Lie algebra u with coeﬃcients in
X. This is at least formally a representation of L; it is not clear how to deﬁne
a nice topology.
Similarly, we would like to calculate
HomG(H0,q
c
(Y, Eω), X).
This should be related to (equal to if L is compact)
HomL(Eω, Hq(u, X)).

Conjecture 10.3. (cf. [KV95], Theorem 5.120). Suppose XK is an admissible
Harish-Chandra module for G, with canonical globalizations Xg (for g = ω,
g = ∞, and so on). Suppose q = l + u is a very nice parabolic subalgebra
of g with Levi factor L (Deﬁnition 6.5). It is known that the Lie algebra
cohomology Hp(u, XK) is an admissible Harish-Chandra module for L. Here
are the conjectures.
(1) The u-cohomology complexes
Hom
6p
u, Xg
have the closed range property, so that the cohomology spaces inherit nice
locally convex topologies. That L acts continuously on these cohomology
spaces is easy.
(2) The representations of L on these cohomology spaces are canonical glob-
alizations:
Hp(u, Xg) ≃[Hp(u, XK)]g
for g = ω, g = ∞, and so on.
(3) In the setting of Question 10.2, there are two ﬁrst quadrant spectral se-
quences with E2 terms
Extr
L(Hn−t(u, Xω), E−ω)
and
Exta
G(Xω, Hn,b(Y, E−ω))
with a common abutment.
(4) There are two ﬁrst quadrant spectral sequences with E2 terms
Extr
L(Eω, Ht(u, X−ω))
and
Exta
G(H0,b
c (Y, Eω), X−ω).
Statement (1) makes sense with Xg replaced by any smooth globalization
of XK; one should ask only that the cohomology be some smooth globalization
of the right Harish-Chandra module. I have not thought carefully about this,
but I know no reason for it to fail. The speciﬁc version in (1) here ought to
be fairly easy to prove, however.
Similarly, statements (3) and (4) should probably be true with Xω and
X−ω replaced by any smooth globalization of XK. The speciﬁc versions here
are those most closely related to the construction of forms in Corollary 9.20.
In the case of the minimal globalization (the case g = ∞), generaliza-
tions of statements (1) and (2) of these conjectures have been established by
Tim Bratten in [Bra98]; he considers arbitrary parabolic subalgebras endowed
with real θ-stable Levi subalgebras. The generalization of (1) for the maximal
globalization follows easily by a duality argument.

Unitary Representations and Complex Analysis
343
Bratten has pointed out that the generalization of (2) cannot extend to
the case of real parabolic subalgebras and distribution or maximal globaliza-
tions. Here is one reason. Suppose that P = LU is a real parabolic subgroup
of G, and that XK is an irreducible Harish-Chandra module with maximal
globalization X−ω. Harish-Chandra’s subquotient theorem guarantees that
H0(u, X−ω) ̸= 0. (Simply embed the dual representation, which is a minimal
globalization, in a space of analytic sections of a bundle on G/P. Then evalua-
tion of sections at the identity coset eP deﬁnes a U-invariant continuous linear
functional on the dual representation; that it, a U-invariant vector in X−ω.
The same argument applies to the distribution globalization.) But H0(u, XK)
is equal to zero in almost all cases, contradicting the analogue of (2).
The spaces ExtL and ExtG are in the category of continuous represen-
tations of G. In order to interpret Conjecture 10.3, it would be helpful to
have
Conjecture 10.4. Suppose XK and Y K are admissible Harish-Chandra mod-
ules for G, with canonical globalizations Xg and Y g, for g = ω, g = ∞, and
so on. Then the standard complex
HomK
6p
(g/k, L(Xω, Y −ω)

has the closed range property. Its cohomology is isomorphic to Extg,K(XK,Y K).
The same result holds with ω replaced by ∞.
Results at least very close to this may be found in [BW80], Chapter 9; I
have not checked whether this statement follows from their results.

These notes are an expanded form of lectures presented at the C.I.M.E.
summer school in representation theory in Venice, June 2004. The sections of
this article roughly follow the ﬁve lectures given. The ﬁrst three lectures (sec-
tions) are meant to give an introduction to an audience of mathematicians
(or mathematics graduate students) to quantum computing. No attempt is
given to describe an implementation of a quantum computer (it is still not
absolutely clear that any exist). There are also some simplifying assumptions
that have been made in these lectures. The short introduction to quantum
mechanics in the ﬁrst section involves an interpretation of measurement that
is still being debated which involves the “collapse of the wave function” after
a measurement. This interpretation is not absolutely necessary but it simpli-
ﬁes the discussion of quantum error correction. The next two sections give
an introduction to quantum algorithms and error correction through exam-
ples including fairly complete explanations of Grover’s (unordered search) and
⋆Research partially supported by ARO and NSF grants.

Shor’s (period search and factorization) algorithms and the quantum perfect
(ﬁve qubit) code. The last two sections present applications of representation
and Lie theory to the subject. We have emphasized the applications to entan-
glement since this is the most mathematical part of recent research in the ﬁeld
and this is also the main area to which the author has made contributions.
The material in subsections 5.1 and 5.3 appears in this article for the ﬁrst
time.
1 The Basics
In his seminal paper [F1] Richard Feynman introduced the idea of a com-
puter based on quantum mechanics. Of course, all modern digital computers
involve transistors that are by their very nature quantum mechanical. How-
ever, the quantum mechanics only plays a role in the theory that explains why
the transistor switches. The actual switch in the computer is treated as if it
were mechanical. In other words as if it were governed by classical mechan-
ics. Feynman had something else in mind. The basic operations of a quantum
computer would involve the allowable transformations of quantum mechanics,
that is, unitary operators and measurements. The analogue of bit strings for a
quantum computer are superpositions of bit strings (we will make this precise
later) and the analogue of a computational step (for example the operation
not on one bit) is a unitary operator on the Hilbert space of bit strings (say
of a ﬁxed length). The reason that Feynman thought that there was a need
for such a “computer” is that quantum mechanical phenomena are extremely
diﬃcult (if not impossible) to model on a digital computer. The reason why
the ﬁeld of quantum computing has blossomed into one of the most active
parts of the sciences is the work of Peter Shor [S1] that showed that on a
(hypothetical) quantum computer there are polynomial time algorithms for
factorization and discrete logarithms. Since most of the security of the inter-
net is based on the assumption that these two problems are computationally
hard (that is, the only known algorithms are superpolynomial in complexity)
this work has attracted an immense amount of attention and trepidation. In
these lectures we will discuss a model for computation based on this idea and
discuss its power, ways in which it diﬀers from standard computation and
its limitations. Before we can get started we need to give a crash course in
quantum mechanics.
1.1 Basic Quantum Mechanics
The states of a quantum mechanical system are the unit vectors of a Hilbert
space, V , over C ignoring phase. In other words the states are the elements
of the projective space of all lines through the origin in V . If v, w ∈V then
we write ⟨v|w⟩for the inner product of v with w. We will follow the physics
convention so the form is conjugate linear in v and linear in w. Following Dirac

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
347
a vector gives rise to a “bra”, ⟨v| and a “ket” |v⟩the latter is exactly the same
as v the former is the linear functional that takes the value ⟨v|w⟩on w. Thus if
v is a state then ⟨v|v⟩= 1. In these lectures most Hilbert spaces will be ﬁnite
dimensional. For the moment we will assume that dim V < ∞. An observable
is a self adjoint operator, A, on V . Thus A has a spectral decomposition
V =
$
λ∈R
Vλ
with A|Vλ = λI. We can write this as follows. The spaces Vλ are orthogonal
relative to the Hilbert space structure. Thus we can deﬁne the orthogonal
projection Pλ : V →Vλ. Then we have A =  λPλ. If v is a state then we set
vλ = Pλv. A measurement of the state v with respect to an observable A yields
a number λ that is an eigenvalue of A with the probability ∥vλ∥2. This leads to
the following problem. If we do another measurement almost instantaneously
we should get a value close to λ. Thus one would expect the probability to
be very close to 1 for the state to be in Vλ. In the standard formulation of
quantum mechanics this is “explained” by the collapse of the wave function.
That is, a measurement by an apparatus corresponding to the observable A
has two eﬀects. The ﬁrst is an eigenvalue, λ of A (the measurement) with
probability ∥vλ∥2 and the second is that the state has collapsed to
vλ
∥vλ∥.
This is one of the least intuitive aspects of quantum mechanics. It has been the
subject of much philosophical discussion. We will not enter into this debate
and will merely take this as an axiom for our system.
If we have a quantum mechanical system then in addition to the Hilbert
space V we have a self adjoint operator H the Hamiltonian of the system.
The evolution of a state in this system is governed by Schroedinger’s equation
dφ
dt = iHφ.
Thus if we have the initial condition φ(0) = v then
φ(t) = eitHv.
Thus the basic dynamics is the operation of unitary operators. If U is a uni-
tary operator on V then |Uv⟩= U |v⟩and ⟨Uv| = ⟨v| U −1. This is the only
consistent way to have ⟨Uv|Uv⟩= ⟨v|v⟩for a unitary operator.
Of course, these ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces do not exist in isolation.
The state of the entire universe, u, is a state in a Hilbert space, U, governed
by the Schroedinger equation with Hamiltonian HU. We we will simplify the
situation and think of the ﬁnite dimensional space V as a tensor factor of U
that is

348
N.R. Wallach
U = V ⊗E
with E standing for the environment. This is not a tremendous assumption
since in practice the part of the universe that will have a real eﬀect on V is
given by this tensor product. Now, the Hamiltonian HU will not preserve the
tensor product structure. Thus, even though we are attempting to do only
operations on states in V the environment will cause the states to change in
ways that are beyond the control of the experiment that we might be attempt-
ing to do on states in V . Thus if we prepare a state on which we will do a
quantum mechanical operation, that is, by applying a unitary transformation
or doing a measurement we can only assume that the state will not “morph”
into a quite diﬀerent state for a very short time. This uncontrolled change of
the state is called decoherence caused by the environment.
The fact that our small Hilbert space V is not completely isolated from the
rest of the universe is the reason why it is more natural to use density matrices
as the basic states. A density matrix (operator) is a self adjoint operator T on
V that is positive semi-deﬁnite and has trace 1. In this context a state v ∈V
would then be called a pure state and a density matrix a mixed state. If v is
a pure state then its density matrix is |v⟩⟨v|. We note that this operator is
just the projection onto the line corresponding to the pure state v. Thus we
can identify the pure states with the mixed states that have rank 1. If T is a
mixed state then T transforms under a unitary operator by T →kTk−1 if k is
unitary. If we have a pure state u in U then it naturally gives rise to a mixed
state on V which is called the reduced density matrix and is deﬁned as follows.
Let {ei} be an orthonormal basis of E. Then u =  vi ⊗ei with vi ∈V . The
reduced density matrix is  |vi⟩⟨vi|. More generally, if T is a mixed state on
U then it gives rise to a mixed state Tr2(T) on V by the formula
⟨w|Tr2(T)|v⟩=

i
⟨w ⊗ei|T|v ⊗ei⟩.
This mixed state is the reduced density matrix. One checks easily that since
unitary operators don’t necessarily preserve the tensor product structure that
a unitary transformation of the state, T, will not necessarily entail a unitary
transformation of the reduced density matrix. We will mainly deal with pure
states in these lectures. However, we should realize that this is a simpliﬁcation
of what nature allows us to see.
1.2 Bits
Although it is not mandatory we will look upon digital computing as the
manipulation of bit strings. That is, we will only consider ﬁxed sequences
of 0’s and 1’s. One bit is either 0 or it is 1. Two bits can have one of four
values 00, 01, 10, 11. These four strings can be looked upon as the expansion
in base 2 of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, they can be looked upon as representatives
of the integers mod 4, or they can be considered to be the standard basis

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
349
of the vector space Z2 × Z2. In general, an n-bit computer can manipulate
bit strings of length n. We will call n the word length of our computer. Most
personal computers now have word length 32 (soon 64). We will not be getting
into the subtleties of computer science in these lectures. Also, we will not
worry about the physical characteristics of the machines that are needed to
do bit manipulations. A computer also can hold a certain number of words
in its memory. There are various forms of memory (fast, somewhat fast, less
fast, slow) but we will ignore the diﬀerences. We will look upon a computer
program as a sequence of steps (usually encoded by bit strings of length equal
to the word length) which implement a certain set of rules that we will call
the algorithm. The ﬁrst step inputs a bit string into memory. Each succeeding
step operates on a sequence of words in memory that came from the operation
of the preceding step and produces another sequence of words, which may or
may not replace some of the words from the previous step and may or may
not put words into new memory locations. If properly designed the program
will have rules that terminate it and under each of the rules an output of bit
strings. That is the actual computation. There are, of course, other ways the
program might terminate, for example it runs out of memory, it is terminated
by the operating system for attempting to access protected memory locations,
or even that it is terminated by the user out of impatience. In these cases there
is no (intended) output except possibly an error message.
This is the von Neumann model of computation. The key is that the com-
puter does one step of a program at a time. Most computers can actually
do several steps at one time. But this is because the computers are actually
several von Neumann computers working simultaneously. For example, a com-
puter might have an adder and a multiplier that can work independently. Or it
might have several central processors that communicate with each other and
attempt to do program steps simultaneously. These modiﬁcations will only
lead to a parallelism that is determined by the number of processors and can
only lead to a constant speed-up of a computation. For example, assume we
have 10 von Neumann computers searching through a sequence of N elements
with the task of ﬁnding one with a speciﬁed property. For example you have
N −1 red chips and 1 white one. The program might be set to divide the
sequence into 10 subsequences each of size N
10 and then each processor is as-
signed the job of searching through one part. In the worst case each processor
will have to evaluate N
10 elements. So we see a speed up of a factor of 10 over
using one processor in this simple problem (slightly less since the worst case
with one processor is N −1).
We will come back to a few more aspects of digital computing as we develop
a model for quantum computation.
1.3 Qubits
The simplest description of the basic objects to be manipulated by a quantum
computer of word length n are complex superpositions of bit strings of length

350
N.R. Wallach
n. Since a bit string is a sequence of numbers and the coeﬃcients of the
superpositions can also be some of these numbers we will use the ket notation
for the bit strings as pure states. These superpositions will be called qubits.
Thus one qubit is an element of the two dimensional vector space over C with
states
a |0⟩+ b |1⟩
and |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. We will be dealing with qubits quantum mechanically so
we ignore phase (multiples by complex numbers of norm 1). Thus our space of
qubits is one dimensional projective space over C. We will think of this qubit
as being in state |0⟩with probability |a|2 and in state |1⟩with probability
|b|2. Although this is a vast simpliﬁcation we will take the simplest one step
operation on a qubit to be a unitary operator (projective unitary operator to
be precise).
Contrasting this with bits we see that on the set of bits {0, 1} there are
exactly 2 basic reversible operations: the identity map and not that inter-
changes 0 and 1. In the case of qubits we have a 3 dimensional continuum
of basic operations that can be done. There is only one caveat. After doing
these operations which are diﬃcult to impossible classically we must do a
measurement to retrieve a bit. This measurement will yield 0 or 1 with some
probability. Thus in a very real sense going to qubits and allowing unitary
transformations has not helped at all.
An element of 2 qubit space will be of the form
u = a |00⟩+ b |01⟩+ c |10⟩+ d |11⟩
with |a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2 + |d|2 = 1. We interpret this as u is in state |00⟩with
probability |a|2, in state |01⟩with probability |b|2, etc. Similarly for n qubits.
The steps in a quantum computation will be unitary transformations. How-
ever, each unitary transformation given in a step will have to be broken up
into basic transformations that we can construct with a known and hopefully
small cost (time and storage).
A quantum program starts with an n qubit state, u0, the input, and then
does a sequence of unitary transformations Tj on the state so the steps are
u1 = T1u0, . . . , um = Tmum−1, and a rule for termination and at termination
a measurement. The output is the measurement of the state to which the
measured state has collapsed.

2 Quantum Algorithms
In the last lecture we gave simple models for a classical and a quantum com-
putation. In this lecture we will give a very simple example of a quantum
algorithm that implements something that is impossible to do on a Von Neu-
mann computer. We will next give a more sophisticated example of a quantum
algorithm (Grover’s algorithm [G1]) that does an unstructured search of N
objects of the type described in the last lecture in
√
N steps. At the end of the
lecture we will introduce the quantum (fast) Fourier transform and explain
why on a (hypothetical) quantum computer it is exponentially faster than the
Fast Fourier transform
2.1 Quantum Parallelism
Suppose that we are studying a function, f, on bit strings that takes the values
1 and −1 and assume that it takes only one step on a classical computer to
calculate its value given a bit string. For example the function that takes
value 1 if the last bit is 0, −1 if it is 1. We will think of bit strings of length n
as binary expansions of the numbers 0, 1, . . . , 2n −1. Thus our n qubit space,
V , has the orthonormal basis |0⟩, |1⟩, . . . , |N −1⟩with N = 2n −1. We can
replace f by the unitary operator deﬁned by T |j⟩= f(j) |j⟩. T operates on a
state v ∈V ,
v =
N−1

j=0
aj |j⟩,
N−1

j=0
|aj|2 = 1
by
Tv =
N−1

j=0
f(j)aj |j⟩.
Quantum mechanically this means that we have calculated f(j) with the
probability |aj|2. In other words the calculation of T on this superposition
seems to have calculated all of the values of f(j) simultaneously if all of
the |aj| > 0 in one quantum step. In a sense we have, but the rub is that
if we do a measurement then all we have after a measurement is f(j) |j⟩
with probability |aj|2 and since we ignore phase the value the object we are
calculating is lost. Perhaps it would be better to decide that we will operate
quantum mechanically and then read the coordinates classically? I assert that
we will still not be able to make direct use of this parallelism. The reason
is that we are only interested in very big N. In this situation the set of
states,
N−1

j=0
aj |j⟩, with |aj|2 all about the same size have a complement in the
sphere of extremely small volume. This implies that most of the states will
have probabilities, |aj|2 ∼
1
N . If n is, say, 1000 then all the coordinates will
be too small to measure classically. We can see this as follows. We consider

the unit sphere in real N dimensional space. Let ωN be the O(N) invariant
volume element on SN−1 that is normalized so that

SN−1
ωN = 1.
We write a state in the form v = cos θu + sin θ |N −1⟩with −π
2 ≤θ ≤π
2 .
With u an element of the unit sphere in N −1 dimensional space. Then we
have
ωN = cN cos θn−2ωN−1 ∧dθ
and cN ∼C

N with C independent of N. The set of all v in the sphere with
last coordinate aN−1 that satisﬁes |aN−1|2 ≥r2 >

which is extremely small for N large.
The upshot is that a quantum algorithm must contain a method of increas-
ing the size of the coeﬃcient of the desired output so that when a measurement
is made will have the output with high probability.
2.2 The Tensor Product Structure of n-qubit Space
Recall that the standard (sometimes called the computational) basis of the
space of 2 qubits is |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩. A physicist would also write |0⟩|1⟩=
|01⟩. We mathematicians would rather think that the multiplication is a tensor
product. That is |0⟩, |1⟩form the standard basis of C2. Then
|0⟩⊗|0⟩, |0⟩⊗|1⟩, |1⟩⊗|0⟩, |1⟩⊗|1⟩
form an orthonormal basis of C2 ⊗C2 with the tensor product Hilbert space
structure. In other words we identify |ab⟩with |a⟩⊗|b⟩. In this form the
original bit strings are fully decomposable that is are tensor products of n
elements in C2. We will call an n-qubit state a product state if it is of the
form
v1 ⊗v2 ⊗· · · ⊗vn
with ∥vi∥2 = 1 for i = 1, . . . , n. One very important product state is the
uniform state (N = 2n):
v =
1
√
N
N−1

j=0
|j⟩.
To see that it is indeed a product state we set u =
1
√
2(|0⟩+ |1⟩). Then
v = u ⊗· · · ⊗u (n-fold tensor product). This formula also shows that the
uniform state can be constructed in n = log2(N) steps. This can be seen by

making an apparatus that implements the one qubit unitary transformation

.
It has the property that H |0⟩= |0⟩+|1⟩
√

, H |1⟩= |0⟩−|1⟩
√

. We write H(k) for
I ⊗· · ·⊗H ⊗· · · I with all factors one qubit operations and all factors but one
the identity and in the k-th factor the Hadamard transformation. Thus on a
quantum computer that can implement a one qubit Hadamard transformation
in constant time can construct the uniform state in logarithmic time. We will
actually over simplify the model and assume that all one qubit operations can
be implemented is one step on a quantum computer, Then
u = H(1)H(2) · · · H(n) |0⟩.
With this in mind we can give our ﬁrst quantum algorithm. Set up an
apparatus that corresponds to an observable, A, with simple spectrum. Here
is the algorithm:
Make a uniform state v.
Measure A.
v collapses to |j⟩with j between 0 and N −1 with probability
1
N .
In other words we are generating truly random numbers. The complexity
of this algorithm is n. On a digital computer the best one can do is generate
pseudo random numbers. The classical algorithms involve multiplication and
division. Thus they are slightly more complex. However they do not generate
random numbers and no deterministic algorithm can (since the numbers will
satisfy the property that they are given by the algorithm).
2.3 Grover’s Algorithm
We return to unstructured search. We assume that we have a function, f, on
n-bit strings that takes the value −1 on exactly one string and 1 on all of
the others. We assume that given a bit string the calculation of the value is
one step (in computer science f might be called an oracle). Here is Grover’s
algorithm:
Form the uniform state u =
1
√
N
 |j⟩. Let T be the unitary transformation
deﬁned by T |j⟩= f(j) |j⟩. Let S be the orthogonal reﬂection about u. That
is
Su(v) = v −2 ⟨u|v⟩u.
Then Su is a unitary operator that in theory can be implemented quantum
mechanically with logarithmic complexity (indeed Grover gave a formula for
Su involving the order of n Hadamard transformations). If the number of bits
is 2 (we are searching a list of 4 elements) then we observe

354
N.R. Wallach
STu = −|j⟩
with f(j) = −1. Thus one quantum operation and one measurement yields the
answer. Whereas classically in the worst case we would have had to calculate
f three times and then printed the answer.
The general algorithm is just an iteration of this step. u0 = u and um+1 =
STum. A calculation using trigonometry shows that after [4π
√
N] steps the
coeﬃcient of |j⟩with f(j) = −1 has absolute value squared .99. (Here [x] is
the maximum of the set of integers less than or equal to x). Thus with almost
certainty a measurement at this step in the iteration will yield the answer.
2.4 The Quantum Fourier Transform
Interpreted as a map of L2(Z/NZ) to itself the fast Fourier transform can be
interpreted as a unitary operator on this Hilbert space. In general, if G is a
ﬁnite abelian group of order |G| then we deﬁne the Hilbert space L2(G) to be
the space of a complex valued functions on G with inner product
⟨f|g⟩=

x∈G
f(x)g(x).
Let G denote the set of unitary characters of G. Then it is standard that the
set {
1
√
|G|χ|χ ∈G} is an orthonormal basis of L2(G). If G = Z/NZ = ZN
and if we set χm(n) = e
2πinm

for m = 0, . . . , N −1 then we can deﬁne
F(f)(m) =

As in the case of the fast Fourier transform we will take N = 2n. The standard
orthonormal basis of L2(ZN) is the set of delta functions {δm|m = 0, . . . ,
N −1} with δm(x) = 1 if x = m and 0 otherwise. We will identify these delta
functions with the computational basis, that is |m⟩= δm. We therefore have
F |m⟩=

The linear extension to n qubit space is the quantum Fourier transform. The

less obvious is that we can devise a quantum algorithm to implement this

operator as (essentially) a tensor product of one qubit operators (which we
are assuming are easily implemented on our hypothetical quantum computer).
We will conclude this section with the factorization (due to Shor [S2]) that
suggests a fast quantum algorithm
If 0 ≤j ≤N −1 then we write j =

3 Factorization and Error Correction
In this section we will study the complexity of the quantum Fourier transform
and indicate its relationship with Shor’s factorization algorithm. We will also
discuss the role of error correction in quantum computing and describe a

3.1 The Complexity of the Quantum Fourier Transform
Recall that our simpliﬁed model takes a one qubit unitary operator to be one
computational step this is a simpliﬁcation but the one qubit operators that
will come into the rest of the discussion of the quantum Fourier transform
are provably of constant complexity. We will also be using some two qubit
operations which are also each of constant complexity. In addition we assume
an implementation of the total ﬂip, τ
v1 ⊗v2 ⊗· · · ⊗vn →vn ⊗vn−1 ⊗· · · ⊗v1
One can show that the complexity of this operation is a multiple of n. We will
show how to implement the transformation

To describe the steps in the implementation we need the notion of a controlled
one qubit operation. Let U ∈U(2) we deﬁne a unitary operator, CU, on
C2 ⊗C2 as follows
CU |j1j2⟩= (U |j1⟩) ⊗|j2⟩
if j2 = 1 and
CU |j1j2⟩= |j1j2⟩
if j2 = 0. We call j2 the control bit. If we are operating on n qubits and
applying a controlled U operation with the control in the k-th factor and
the operation in the l-th factor then we will write Cl,k
U
(the reader should be
warned that this is not standard notation). Thus
C23
U |0110⟩= |0⟩⊗U |1⟩⊗|1⟩⊗|0⟩
and
C23
U |0100⟩= |0100⟩.
If U is easily implemented then controlled U is also easily implemented. We
deﬁne

and recall that the Hadamard operator acting on the k-th qubit was denoted
H(k) in section 2. We will now describe an operator the implements the
quantum Fourier transform. It will be a product τ ◦AnAn−1 · · · A1 ◦τ with
A1 = C1,n
Un C1,n−1
Un−1 · · · C1,2
U2 H(1), . . .

357
Ak = Ck,n
Uk Ck,n−1
Uk−1 · · · Ck,k+1
U2
H(k), . . . , An = H(n).
We note that in this expression the operator Ak changes the k-th qubit but
doesn’t depend on the value of the j-th qubit for j < k. We leave it to
the reader to expand the product and see that it works. The operator Ak is
a product of k operators that we can assume are implemented in constant
time. Thus the complexity of the transform is a constant times n(n+1)
2
. This
is exponentially faster than the classical fast Fourier transform which has
complexity Nn.
Shor introduced this transform in order to give a generalization of an al-
gorithm of Deutch (cf. [NC]). Shor’s algorithm ﬁnds the period of a function
with an unknown period with complexity a power of the number of bits in-
volved. A very nice exposition of the period ﬁnding algorithm can be found
in [NC]. We will give a diﬀerent approach here.
We begin with a periodic integer valued function, f of unknown period L
which we know is less than 2n. We will work in 2n qubit space and consider
the values of the function to be between 0 and N −1 with N = 22n (this is not
necessary but is not a real restriction since we will know the range of values of
the function and for useful application we should be able to take n very large).
We can thus think of f as deﬁning a unitary map from
02n C2
⊗
02n C2
to itself by
F (|x⟩⊗|y⟩) = |x⟩⊗|f(x) + y⟩.
Here the addition is modulo 22n. We will think of each of the tensor factors
of 2n qubits as a register. The ﬁrst step in the algorithm is to construct the
uniform state

N

1≤x,y≤N−1
|x⟩⊗|y⟩
and then do a measurement in the second register (factor) getting

N

1≤x≤N−1
|x⟩⊗|yo⟩.
We now apply F and get
1
√
N

1≤x≤N−1
|x⟩⊗|f(x) + yo⟩.
Set g(x) = f(x) + yo. g is also a periodic function of period L projected into
Z22n. Thus it doesn’t matter what yo occurred. We now measure the second
register and get
1
H
|{x|g(x) = g(xo)}|

g(x)=g(xo)
|x⟩⊗|g(xo)⟩.

358
N.R. Wallach
We write N = LM + r with 0 ≤r < L then |{x|g(x) = g(xo)}| = M or
M + 1. Since we are assuming that N is large compared to L in formulas we
will use the approximation |{x|g(x) = g(xo)}| = M. We will also ignore the
congruence modulo 22n. Thus after the measurement in the second register
we have

M

s

where we may take as an approximation the sum over all 0 ≤s ≤M −1. We

We now observe that if q is a strictly positive integer and c is a real number
then we have


j=0
exp(2πijc)
is equal to
1 −exp(2πiqc)
1 −exp(2πic)
if c is not an integer and it is equal to q if c ∈Z. Thus observing that
MN = M 2  N
M
	
and we are approximating N
M by L we ﬁnd that if c = xL/N
is not an integer then the probability of having collapsed to |x⟩⊗|g(xo)⟩is
approximately
1
M 2L

1 −exp(2πiMc)
1 −exp(2πic)

2
.
And the probability of obtaining x with xL/N an integer is
1
√
L. We therefore
see that after a measurement it is most probable that the state will have
collapsed to |x⟩⊗|g(xo)⟩with xL/N very close to being an integer. That is, if
the integral part of N
x is an integer times L. One then checks if the outcome is
a period by substitution. If it is a period (i.e. a multiple of L) we must make
sure that we have found the minimal period. After on the order of log(L)
applications of this method one would have determined L with probability
close to 1
We note that this algorithm is probabilistic as are all known quantum
algorithms. This method of Shor is a special case of a larger class of algorithms
known as “hidden subgroup”problems. Here one starts with a group G, an

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
359
unknown subgroup H and a function f on G such that f is constant on the
cosets of H. The problem is to construct an eﬃcient algorithm to ﬁnd H. This
has been done for G ﬁnite and commutative, for H a normal subgroup and
for some two step solvable groups.
3.2 Reduction of Factorization to Period Search
We will now describe the method Shor uses to reduce the problem of factor-
ization to period search for which he had devised a fast quantum algorithm.
Consider an integer N for which we want to ﬁnd a nontrivial factor. We may
assume that it is odd and composite. Chose a number 1 < y < N −1 ran-
domly. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of N and y is not one then we are
done. We can therefore assume that gcd(y, N) = 1. Hence y is invertible as
an element of ZN (under multiplication). Consider f(m) = ym mod N. Then
since the group of invertible elements of the ring ZN is a ﬁnite group the
function will have a minimum period. We can thus use Shor’s algorithm to
ﬁnd the period, T. If T is even we assert that y
T
2 + 1 and N have a common
factor larger than 1. We can thus use the Euclidean algorithm (which is easy
classically) to ﬁnd a factor of N. Before we demonstrate that this works con-
sider N = 30 and y = 11. Then f(0) = 1, f(1) = 11, 112 = 121 = 1 mod 30,
so f(2) = 1 = f(0). Thus T = 2. Now 111 + 1 = 12. The greatest common
divisor of 12 and 30 is 6.
We will now prove the assertion about the greatest common divisor. We
ﬁrst note that
(y
T
2 + 1)2 = yT + 2y
T
2 + 1.
But yT = 1+m·N by the deﬁnition of T. Thus (y
T
2 +1)2 ≡2(y
T
2 +1) mod N.
Hence
(y
T
2 + 1)2 −2(y
T
2 + 1)
is evenly divisible by N. We therefore see that

(y

T
2 + 1

=

y

is evenly divisible by N. Hence, if y
T
2 + 1 and N have no common factor then
y
T
2 −1 is evenly divisible by N. This would imply that T
2 (which is smaller
than T) satisﬁes
f(x + T
2 ) = f(x).
This contradicts the choice of T as the minimal period. This is still not enough
to get a non-trivial divisor of N. We must still show that y can be chosen so
that N doesn’t divide y
T
2 + 1 and that we can choose y so that T is even.
Neither can be done with certainty. What can be proved is that if N is not a
pure prime power then the probability of choosing 1 < y < N −1 such that
gcd(y, N) = 1, f has even period and N doesn’t divide y
T
2 + 1 is at least

360
N.R. Wallach
3
4. The proof of this would take us too far aﬁeld, a good reference is [NC].
We note that classically the test whether a number, N, is a pure power of a
number a > 2 and if so to calculate the number is polynomial in the number
of bits of N. The upshot is that a quantum computer will factor a number
with very large probability (if the algorithm is done say 10 times then the
probability of success would be 0.999999 in polynomial time).
3.3 Error Correction
So far we have ignored several of the diﬃculties that we had indicated in sec-
tion 1 having to do with two problems that are caused by the environment.
The ﬁrst is that we can only really look at mixed states since we cannot com-
pute the actual action of the environment and the second is the decoherence
caused by the dynamics of the total system. We will assume that our quantum
computations are divided into steps that take so little time that our initial
pure states remain close enough to being pure states that we can ignore the
ﬁrst diﬃculty. For the second we will look at the decoherence over this small
period as a small error. For most of the systems that are proposed the most
likely error is a one qubit error. Thus as in classical error correction we will
show how to set up a quantum error correcting code that corrects a one qubit
error. The standard procedure is to encode a qubit as an element of a two
dimensional subspace of a higher qubit space.
That is we take V to be the space of n qubits and we take u0 and u1
orthonormal in V and assign
a |0⟩+ b |1⟩→au0 + bu1.
The right hand side will be called the encoded qubit. The question is what is
the most likely error if we transmit the encoded qubit? The generally accepted
answer is that it would be a transformation of the form
E = I ⊗· · · ⊗A ⊗· · · ⊗I
with all factors the identity except for an A in the k-th factor and this A is a
fairly arbitrary linear map on 1-qubit space that is close to the identity. The
problem is to ﬁx the error which means change E (au0 + bu1) to au0 + bu1
without knowing which qubit has an error, what the error is and not collapsing
the wave function of the unknown qubit. Classically one can transmit one bit
in terms of 3 bits. 0 →000, 1 →111. The most likely error is a not in one bit.
To ﬁx such an error one reads the sum of the entries of this possibly erroneous
output and if it is at most 1 then change it to 000 if it is at least 2 change it to
111. This will correct exactly one not in any position. Quantum mechanically
we must correct a continuum of possible errors. This seems to be impossible
and if it were impossible then quantum computation looked impossible also
since decoherence would set in before we could do any useful computation. As
usual, Shor [S3] found a method. We will describe a later development that

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
361
yielded a quantum analog of a perfect code (such as the three bit classical
error correction scheme described above).
We will describe a special class of error correcting codes that are known
as orthogonal codes (or non-degenerate codes). In fact, Shor’s original exam-
ple was not an orthogonal code, but we feel that these codes are easier for
mathematicians to understand. We will need some additional notation.
If X, Y ∈M2(C) then we deﬁne ⟨X|Y ⟩=
1
2tr(X∗Y ) (X∗= X† to a
physicist, is the Hermitian adjoint of X). Given j = 1, . . . , n we deﬁne Fj :
M2(C) →End
0n C2	
by
Fj(A) = I ⊗· · · ⊗A ⊗· · · ⊗I
where all of the factors on the right hand side are I except for the k-th term
which is A. We say that an isometry, T : C2 →0n C2 deﬁnes an orthogonal
code space if it has the following properties:
1. The maps Tj : M2(C) ⊗C2 →0n C2 given by Tj(X ⊗v) = Fj(X)T(v)
are isometries (onto their images) for i = 1, . . . , n.
2. If V = {X ∈M2(C)|tr(X) = 0}. Then the sum
Z = T(C2) ⊕
$
1≤j≤n
Tj(V ⊗C2)
is an orthogonal direct sum.
We will now show how to correct a one qubit error if we have an orthogonal
code. Let X1, X2, X3 be an orthonormal basis of V consisting of invertible
elements. For example we could choose the Pauli matrices

We write 0n C2 = Z ⊕Z′ with Z′ the orthogonal complement to Z. Let A
be an observable that acts by distinct scalars as indicated λ0I on T(C2), λijI
on Tj(Xi ⊗C2), 1 ≤j ≤n, 1 ≤i ≤3 and µI on Z
′. If we start with T(v)
and it has incurred an error and we have w rather than T(v) then we do a
measurement of A on w. If the measurement is µ then with high probability
the error wasn’t a one qubit error. Otherwise we assume a one qubit error
then there is j such that w = Tj(X ⊗v). X = aI + bX1 + cX2 + dX2. Thus
with probability 1 the eigenvalue will be one of λ0, λ1j, λ2j, λ3j. If it is λ0
then w will have collapsed to v. If it is λij then if w collapses to z then
Fj(X−1
i
)z = T(v) we have thus corrected the error.
Obviously, to use this idea we must have a way of ﬁnding T. We note ﬁrst
of all that dim Z ≤2n and dim Z = 6n + 2 . If 6n + 2 ≤2n then n ≥5 and
if n = 5 then 25 = 6 · 5 + 2. Thus the smallest n that we could use would be
n = 5. We will now give conditions on a map T that are equivalent to having
an orthogonal code. If w ∈0n C2 then w =  wj |j⟩. Let 0 ≤p < q < n be
two bit positions. Then we form a 4×2n−2 matrix as follows. The i = i0 +i12,
j = j0 + j12 + . . . + jn−32n−3 entry is wk where

k = j0 + · · · + jp−12p−1 + i02p + jp2p+1 + · · · +
jq−22q−1 + i12q + jq−12q+1 + · · · + jn−32n−1.
If p = 0, q = 1 this is just k = i0 + i12 + 22(j0 + j12 + · · · + jn−32n−3). Let
W(p, q, w) denote this matrix. We have
Theorem 1. T : C2 →0n C2 deﬁnes an orthogonal code if and only if
W(p, q, T |i⟩)W(p, q, T |j⟩)∗= 1
4δi,jI.
For all p, q and i, j ∈{0, 1}.
This can be written as a system of quadratic equations. If we put them
into Mathematica for n = 5 the ﬁrst solution is given as follows: We deﬁne
⟨j1j2j3j4j5⟩= |j1j2j3j4j5⟩+ |j5j1j2j3j4⟩+ |j4j5j1j2j3⟩
+ |j3j4j5j1j2⟩+ |j2j3j4j5j1⟩.
Then set
T |0⟩= 1
4 (|0000⟩+ ⟨11000⟩−⟨10100⟩−⟨11110⟩)
and
T |1⟩= 1
4 (|11111⟩+ ⟨00111⟩−⟨01011⟩−⟨00001⟩) .
Because of the symmetry it is easy to check that the condition of the theorem
is satisﬁed. This code was originally found by other methods (c.f. [KL]).

4 Entanglement
As we have seen the only non-trivial reversible one bit operation is not which
interchanges 0 and 1. We have made the simplifying assumption that all one
qubit unitary operators are easily implementable on a quantum computer. The
operation not gives rise to the unitary operator in one qubit with matrix

relative to the computational basis |0⟩, |1⟩. We will say that a transformation
of n bits that is given by applying either not or the identity to each bit is a
classical local transformation. A quantum local transformation in n qubits is
a unitary operator of the form
A1 ⊗A2 ⊗· · · ⊗An
where Ai ∈U(2). There is a major distinction between the classical and
the quantum cases. The classical local transformations act transitively on
the set of all n bit bit strings. Whereas the quantum local transformations
act transitively only in the case when n = 1. For example there is no local
transformation that takes the state
|00⟩+ |11⟩
√
2
to |00⟩(see the next section for a proof). We will call a state that is not a
product state (not in the orbit of |00⟩under local transformations) an en-
tangled state. The two code words of the ﬁve bit error correcting code are
entangled. Furthermore, entanglement explains some of the apparent para-
doxes that appeared in the early thought experiments of quantum mechanics.
It is also basic to quantum teleportation (a subject that we will not be cov-
ering in these sections). In this section we will study the orbit structure of
the local transformations on the pure states and in particular functions that
help to separate these orbits: the measures of entanglement. We will empha-
size methods that allow one to determine if two states are related by a local
transformation and to determine the extent of the entanglement of a state.
4.1 Measures of Entanglement
We will ﬁrst look at the example of an entangled state: |00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
. One way that
one can see that it is entangled is by observing that if we act on C2 ⊗C2 by
G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C) by the tensor product action, then G leaves invariant
a symmetric form, the tensor product of the symplectic forms on each of the
C2 factors that are SL(2, C) invariant. This form, ( , ), is given by
(|00⟩, |11⟩) = (|11⟩, |00⟩= 1,
(|01⟩, |10⟩) = (|10⟩, |01⟩) = −1
and all the other products are 0. We note that ( |00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
, |00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
) = 1 and
(|00⟩, |00⟩) = 0 so there can’t be a local transformation taking one to another
since the function φ(u) = |(u, u)| is invariant under local transformations. It is
an example of a measure of entanglement. Indeed, one can prove that a state,
u, in 2 qubits is entangled if and only if φ(u) > 0. Another property enjoyed
by this function is that for all pure 2 qubit states φ(u) ≤1 and φ(u) = 1 if

364
N.R. Wallach
and only if u is in the orbit of |00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
under local transformations. To prove
the upper bound we consider u = a |00⟩+ b |01⟩+ c |10⟩+ d |11⟩. Then φ(u) =
2(ad−bc). Since 2|a||d| ≤|a|2+|d|2 we have |φ(u)| ≤|a|2+|b|2+|c|2+|d|2 = 1.
Although it is not hard to prove the assertion about the orbit directly we will
use a result of Kempf and Ness [KN] which is useful in other contexts. For
those of you who are unfamiliar with semisimple Lie groups take G to be the
product of n copies of SL(2, C) and K to be n copies of SU(2).
Theorem 2. Let G be a semisimple Lie group over C and let K be a maximal
compact subgroup of G. Let (π, V ) be a ﬁnite dimensional holomorphic repre-
sentation of G with the K-invariant Hilbert space structure ⟨| ⟩. Let v ∈V
and m = inf{⟨π(g)v|π(g)v⟩|g ∈G}. Then if u ∈π(G)v and ⟨u|u⟩= m then
π(K)u = {w ∈π(G)v| ⟨w|w⟩= m}. Furthermore the inﬁmum is actually
attained if and only if the orbit π(G)v is closed.
In words this says that the elements of minimal norm in a G orbit form a
single K-orbit.
We will now give an idea of the proof. We note that Lie(G) = Lie(K) +
iLie(K). We therefore have
G = K exp(iLie(K)).
If X ∈iLie(K) then dπ(X)∗= dπ(X). Thus
d2
dt2 ⟨π(exp tX)v|π(exp tX)v⟩
= 4 ⟨dπ(X)π(exp tX)v|dπ(X)π(exp tX)v⟩≥0
With equality if and only if dπ(X)v = 0. Everything follows from this.
We will now show how the Kempf-Ness result applies to our situation for
2 qubits. We ﬁrst note that relative to G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C) the space
V = C2 ⊗C2 has the following orbit structure. For each λ ∈C −{0} the set
Mλ = {w ∈V |(v, v) = λ} is a single orbit. The other orbits are π(G) |00⟩
and {0}. The union of the latter two is M0. We set u0 = |00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
. We note
that we have Mλ = zπ(G)u0 with z2 = λ. We therefore see that the elements
in the unit sphere that maximize φ are contained in the set of elements the
form w = eiθ
π(g)u0
∥π(g)u0∥, g ∈G. For such a w we have φ(w) =
1
∥π(g)u0∥2 . Thus
maximizing φ on the unit sphere means (up to phase) minimizing the norm
on π(G)u0. The Kempf-Ness theorem implies that this subset of π(G)u0 is
π(K)u0. This completes the proof of the assertion.
We note that the group of local transformations on 0n C2 is the image
of S1 × SU(2)n with S1 the circle group acting by scalar multiplication and
SU(2)n acting by the tensor product action (i.e. by local transformations). We
will therefore concentrate on invariants for SU(2)n. We also note that if we
consider φ(u)2 rather than φ(u) then it is a polynomial function on C2 ⊗C2 as
a real vector space. We will only consider measures of entanglement that are

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
365
polynomials invariant under K = SU(2)n on 0n C2 as a real vector space.
We will use the term measure of entanglement for such a polynomial. We will
denote the algebra of such polynomials by PR( 0n C2)K. These are exactly
what we need to separate the K-orbits.
Theorem 3. If u, v ∈0n C2 then u ∈π(K)v if and only if f(u) = f(v) for
all f ∈PR( 0n C2)K.
We also note that if we look at the action of the circle group by mul-
tiplication on 0n C2 we can deﬁne a Z-grading on PR( 0n C2)K by f ∈
Pj
R( 0n C2)K if f ∈PR( 0n C2)K and f(zu) = zjf(u) for all z ∈S1 and
u ∈0n C2.
Theorem 4. If u, v ∈0n C2 then u ∈S1π(K)v if and only if f(u) = f(v)
for all f ∈P0
R( 0n C2)K.
Both of these theorems are consequences of the following result.
Theorem 5. Let U be a compact Lie group. Let (ρ, W) be a ﬁnite dimensional
representation of U on a real Hilbert space. Let P(W)U be the algebra of all
complex valued polynomials on W that are invariant under U. If u, v ∈W
then u ∈ρ(U)v if and only if f(u) = f(v) for all f ∈P(W)U.
Proof.
The necessity is obvious. Since v →∥v∥2 is in P(W)U we will
prove that if ∥v∥= ∥u∥= r > 0 and f(u) = f(v) for all f ∈P(W)U then u ∈
ρ(U)v. The Stone-Weierstrauss theorem implies that the restriction of P(W)
to the sphere of radius r, Sr, is uniformly dense in the space of continuous
functions on Sr. Suppose that ρ(U)v ∩ρ(U)u is empty then Uryson’s Lemma
implies there is a continuous function ϕ on Sr such that ϕ|ρ(U)v ≡1 and
ϕ|ρ(U)u ≡0. The uniform density implies that there exists an f ∈P(W) such
that |f(x) −ϕ(x)| < 1
4 for all x ∈Sr. Let du denote normalized invariant
measure on U. We deﬁne f(x) =
7
U
f(ρ(z)x)dz. Then f ∈P(W)U. We have
|f(v) −1| =

U
f(ρ(z)v)dz −1

U
|f(ρ(z)v)dz −ϕ(ρ(z)v)|dz ≤1

hence |f(v)| > 3
4 similarly |f(u)| < 1
4. This proves the theorem.
4.2 Three Qubits
These results make it reasonable to assert that the orbit of
|00⟩+|11⟩
√
2
under
local transformations consists of the most entangled two qubit states. In the
case of 3 qubits there is a similar result. First the ring of invariant (complex
polynomials) on C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 under the tensor product action of

366
N.R. Wallach
G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)
is generated by one element, f, of degree 4 (here we will be stating several
results without proof in this case the details can be found in [GrW]). We can
deﬁne it as follows: if v ∈C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 then we can write it as
v = |0⟩⊗v0 + |1⟩⊗v1
with v0, v1 ∈C2 ⊗C2. If we use the symmetric form deﬁned above we have
f(v) = det
(v0, v0) (v0, v1)
(v1, v0) (v1, v1)

.
As in the case of two qubits most of the orbits under G are described by the
values of f. Here we set Mλ = {v ∈C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2|f(v) = λ}. Then if λ ̸= 0
we have Mλ consists of a single orbit. If λ = 0 then there are 6 orbits in M0.
We note that f( |000⟩+|111⟩
√
2
) = 1
4. Thus Mλ = zG

|000⟩+|111⟩
√


with z4 = 4λ.
We will now describe the orbits in M0. First there is the open orbit in this
quartic given as the orbit of
w0 = |001⟩+ |010⟩+ |100⟩
√
3
.
If we remove this orbit from M0 then there are three open orbits in what
remains. They are the orbits of
|000⟩+|011⟩
√
2
, |000⟩+|101⟩
√
2
and
|000⟩+|110⟩
√
2
. If in
addition these are removed then what we have left is the union of 0 and the
product states (which form a single orbit).
One can show by an argument similar to that in two qubits that if u is
a state then |f(u)| ≤
1
4 and if uo =
|000⟩+|111⟩
√
2
then f(uo) =
1
4. Since the
set where f is non-zero is exactly the set of all elements C×G

|000⟩+|111⟩
√


we see that if u is a state with
|f(u)| ̸= 0 then u =
guo
∥guo∥with g ∈G.
Thus f(u) = f

guo
∥guo∥

=
1
∥guo∥4 f(guo) =
1
4∥guo∥4 . Thus the set of states with
|f(u)| =
1
4 are exactly the elements that minimize the value of ∥guo∥4 for
g ∈G. Thus Theorem 2 implies:
Proposition 6. If K = S1SU(2)×SU(2)×SU(2) then
{v ∈C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2||f(v)| = 1
4, ∥v∥= 1} = K

.
Thus one value of one invariant is enough to determine if a state can be
gotten from |000⟩+|111⟩

by local transformations. For example
v = |111⟩+ |001⟩+ |010⟩+ |100⟩

4. So it can be obtained by a local transformation
from |000⟩+|111⟩
√
2
.
So far we have been analyzing only one polynomial measure of entangle-
ment. There is the natural problem of determining a generating set for these
measures. To do this it is useful to reduce the problem to a problem involving
complex algebraic groups and complex polynomials. The basic idea is that
if G is a simply connected semi-simple Lie group over C then G is a linear
algebraic group. If K is a maximal compact subgroup of G and if (ρ, V ) is
a ﬁnite dimensional unitary representation of K then ρ extends to a regular
representation of G on V . The real polynomials on V are the complex poly-
nomials in both the bra and the ket vectors. The ket vectors give a copy of V
as a complex vector space whereas the ket vectors give a copy of the complex
dual representation of V . This implies that the algebra PR(V )K is naturally
isomorphic with P(V ⊕V ∗)G. In the case when we are dealing with qubits the
representation of G = SL(2)n on 0n C2 is self dual. We are thus looking at
the problem of determining the invariants of G acting on two copies of 0n C2
by the diagonal action. We analyze this problem for two and three qubits.
4.3 Measures of Entanglement for Two and Three Qubits
We ﬁrst look at 2 qubits and continue the discussion begun in the previous
subsection. As we have observed G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C) leaves invariant a
symmetric bilinear form on C2 ⊗C2. A dimension count shows that the image
of G on C2 ⊗C2 is the full orthogonal group for this form. Thus the action on
C2⊗C2 can be interpreted as the action of SO(4, C) on C4. We are thus looking
at the invariants of SO(4, C) on two copies of C4. Classical invariant theory
implies that the algebra of invariants is generated by the three polynomials
α(v ⊕w) = (v, v), β(v ⊕w) = (v, w) and γ(v ⊕w) = (w, w), This implies
Lemma 7. The algebra of measures of entanglement in 2 qubits is the set of
polynomials in (v, v), ⟨v|v⟩and (v, v).
Thus in this case we were using the only “interesting” measure, since we
are only considering states which are assumed to satisfy ⟨v|v⟩= 1.
The situation is diﬀerent for three qubits. We will describe a set of gener-
ators in this case that was determined in [MW1] our method is a modiﬁcation
which is an outgrowth of joint work with H. Kraft. As above we look upon
C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 as C2 ⊗C4 and G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)×SL(2, C) acting as
SL(2, C)×SO(4, C). For the moment we will ignore the SL(2, C) factor and
look at I⊗SO(4, C) acting on two copies of C2 ⊗C4. If we consider only the
action of SO(4, C) then we are looking at its action on 4 copies of C4. We
look at this as SO(4, C) acting on X ∈M4(C) under right multiplication by
the transpose of the matrix. Then the invariants for SO(4, C) are generated
by the matrix entries of XXT (the upper T stands for transpose) and det(X)
(for these results and others stated without proof in this subsection please see

368
N.R. Wallach
[GW]). We now look at the action of the remaining SL(2, C). The SL(2, C)
is acting on the left on the matrix via multiplication by the block diagonal
matrix
h =
g 0

.
Thus the SL(2, C) factor is acting on the generators of the SO(4, C) invariants
trivially on γ = det X (an invariant under the full G of degree 4) and via
hXXT hT with h as above, We write XXT in block form
 A B

then the SL(2, C) is acting on the components via A →gAgT , B
→
gBgT , C →gCgT . We note that A and C are symmetric and completely
general and B is an arbitrary 2 × 2 matrix which we can write as
a

+ Z
with Z a general two by two symmetric matrix. The coeﬃcient a deﬁnes
an invariant for G of degree 2 on the qubits which we will call α. The rest
of the action is by three copies of the action of SL(2, C) on the symmetric
2 × 2 matrices. Using the trace form we see that this is just the action of
SO(3, C) on three copies of C3. Again we look upon this as the action of
SO(3, C) on Y = M3(C) via left multiplication. The invariants in this case
are generated by β = det Y (an invariant of degree 6 on the qubits) and the
matrix coeﬃcients of Y T Y which yield 6 invariants of degree 4. The upshot
is the invariants are generated by an invariant of degree 2 (α), an invariant
of degree 4 (γ), an invariant of degree 6 (β) and 6 invariants of degree 4 (the
matrix coeﬃcients of Y T Y ), µ1, . . . , µ6. We note that the invariants γ and β
have the property that their squares are invariant under O(3) × O(4). Thus
γ2 and β2 are in the algebra generated by α and µ1, . . . , µ6. We can also
see from the invariant theory of SO(3) that the functions α, µ1, . . . , µ6 are
algebraically independent. We therefore see that the full ring of invariants is
C[α, µ1, . . . , µ6] ⊕C[α, µ1, . . . , µ6]β ⊕C[α, µ1, . . . , µ6]γ ⊕C[α, µ1, . . . , µ6]βγ.

5 Four and More Qubits
In the cases of 2 and 3 qubits it is fairly clear what the maximally entangled
states should be or at least there are just a few candidates for that honor. We
will see that there is an immense variety of states that are highly entangled in
the case of 4 qubits. This and the calculation of Hilbert series for measures of
entanglement (see subsection 5.2) indicate that the search for all measures of
entanglement or the complete description of the orbit structure for arbitrary
numbers of qubits will be so hard and complicated as to become useless.
However the case of 4 qubits gives some indications of how to ﬁnd more
invariants. Also, methods similar to the Kempf-Ness theorem can be used to
prove uniqueness theorems (for example the theorem of Rains [R] that implies
that the 5 bit error correcting code we discussed earlier is unique up to local
transformations).
As it turns out the orbit structure under
G = SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)×SL(2, C)
on C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 can be determined using the results of Kostant
and Rallis [KR]. Since it ﬁts in their theory in case of the symmetric pair
(SO(4, 4), SO(4)×SO(4)). We will now describe the outgrowth of this theory
purely in terms of qubits.
5.1 Four Qubits
We are therefore analyzing the action of G = SL(2) × SL(2) × SL(2) × SL(2)
on the space V = C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 ⊗C2 via the tensor product action
(g1, g2, g3, g4)(v1 ⊗v2 ⊗v3 ⊗v4) = g1v1 ⊗g2v2 ⊗g3v3 ⊗g4v4
We ﬁrst note that if H = SL(2) × SL(2) and if W = C2 ⊗C2 and if we
have H act on W by the tensor product action then there is a H-invariant
non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, (. . . , . . .), on W given as follows
(v ⊗w, x ⊗y) = ω(v, x)ω(w, y).
Here ω((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = x1y2 −x2y1. This form allows us to deﬁne a linear
map, T, of V onto End(W) in the following way
T(v1 ⊗v2 ⊗v3 ⊗v4)(w1 ⊗w2) = ω(v3, w1)ω(v4, w2)v1 ⊗v2.
We look upon G as H × H. Thus if g = (h1, h2) then

370
N.R. Wallach
T(gv)(w) = h1T(v)(h−1
2 w).
If A ∈End(W) then we deﬁne A# by (Aw1, w2) = (w1, A#w2). We note that
if h ∈H then h# = h−1. This implies that
T(gv)T(gv)# = h1T(v)h−1
2 (h1T(v)h−1
2 )#
= h1T(v)h−1
2 h2T(v)#h−1
1
= h1T(v)T(v)#h−1
1 .
We therefore have invariants f2j(v) = tr((T(v)T(v)#)j), j = 1, 2, . . . and
g4(v) = det(T(v)).
Theorem 8. The ring of invariants under the action of G on V is generated
by the algebraically independent elements f2, f4, g4, f6.
The following discussion gives a sketch of a proof.
We will use qubit notation for elements of V . Thus V has a basis consisting
of elements |i0i1i2i3⟩with ij = 0, 1. We set
v1 = 1
2(|0000⟩+ |1111⟩+ |0011⟩+ |1100⟩),
v2 = 1
2(|0000⟩+ |1111⟩−|0011⟩−|1100⟩),
v3 = 1
2(|1010⟩+ |0101⟩+ |0110⟩+ |1001⟩),
v4 = 1
2(|1010⟩+ |0101⟩−|0110⟩−|1001⟩).
These states can be described in terms of the Bell states for 2 qubits. Let
u± = |00⟩±|11⟩
√
2
and v± = |01⟩±|10⟩
√
2
then
v1 = u+ ⊗u+, v2 = u−⊗u−, v3 = v+ ⊗v+, v4 = v−⊗v−.
We note that if v = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + x4v4 then
T(v) =

Hence

and
g4(v) = x1x2x3x4.
We note that this implies that the functions f2, f4, g4, f6 are algebraically
independent. Set a = {v = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + x4v4|xj ∈C} and a′ =
{v = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + x4v4|xi ̸= ±xj for i ̸= j}. One can check that

the map G × a′ →V given by g, v −→gv is regular. Furthermore, if x ∈a′
then the set of g ∈G such that gx = x is ﬁnite. Since dim G = 12 and
dim a = 4 we see that if f is a G invariant polynomial then f is completely
determined by its restriction to a (since Gg′ has interior). We also note that
if N = {g ∈G|ga = a} then the group W = N|a is the subgroup of the group
generated by the linear maps given by the permutations of v1, v2, v3, v4 and
those that involve an even number of sign changes. For example,

corresponds to v1 →v1, v2 →−v3, v3 →−v2, v4 →v4. Thus W is the
subgroup of the group of signed permutations with an even number of sign
changes. One can check directly that every invariant under W is a polynomial
in (f2)|a, (f4)|a, (g4)|a,(f6)|a This completes the sketch of the proof of the
theorem.
Remark 9. This result is an explicit form of the Chevalley restriction theorem
for the group SO(4, 4).
We will now relate the space a to the orbit structure. For this we need
another construct. If v, w ∈C2 then we write vw for the product of v, w in
S2(C2). We set
[u1 ⊗u2 ⊗u3 ⊗u4, w1 ⊗w2 ⊗w3 ⊗w4]i =
⎛
⎝
j̸=i
ω(uj, wj)
⎞
⎠uiwi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
We say that v, w ∈V commute if [v, w]i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. We note
that [vi, vj]k = 0 for i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, 4. We also observe that if v, w ∈V and
g = (g1, . . . , g4) ∈G then [gv, gw]i = gi[v, w]i with the latter given by the
action of SL(2) on S2(C2). If v ∈V we will say that v is nilpotent if T(v)T(v)#
is nilpotent (that is, some power of T(v)T(v)# is 0). This is the same as saying
that f2j(v) = 0 for all j = 1, 2, . . . . Hilbert’s criterion for this condition is
Theorem 10. v is nilpotent if and only if there is a rational homomorphism,
φ, of the group C× = {z ∈C|z ̸= 0} into G such that limz→0 φ(z)v = 0. We
note that the action of G stabilizes the set of nilpotent elements.
If v ∈V set Gv = {g ∈G|gv = v}. We can now state the basic result
on the orbit structure of G on V . We will call an element of Ga semi-simple.
Then the Jordan decomposition of [KR] implies

372
N.R. Wallach
Theorem 11. An element v ∈V is semi-simple if and only if Gv is closed.
Let v be an element of V then v = s + n with s semi-simple and n nilpotent
such that [s, n]i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. If s, s′ are semi-simple and n, n′ are
nilpotent and commute with s, s′ respectively then s + n = s′ + n′ if an only
if s = s′ and n = n′. If g ∈G, v ∈a and gv ∈a then there exists w ∈W
such that wv = gv. If s ∈a and n, n′ ∈V are nilpotent and commute with s
then if there exists g ∈G such that g(s + n) = s + n′ then there exists h ∈Gs
such that hn = n′. Finally, if s ∈a and if Ns = {v ∈V |v is nilpotent and
commutes with s} then Ns consists of a ﬁnite number of Gs orbits.
We will next give a quantitative version of this theorem. We will ﬁrst
establish a bit more terminology.
We will say that a nilpotent element, n, is regular if setting U=T(n)T(n)#,
R = T(n)# then R, RU + UR, RU 2 + U 2R, RU 3 + U 3R are linearly indepen-
dent operators. A family of such examples is
a |0011⟩+ b |0100⟩+ c |1001⟩+ d |1010⟩
with abcd ̸= 0. It is easily seen that all of the regular elements of the above
form are in the G orbit of the element with a, b, c, d all equal to 1. Let us
call this element no. It turns out that there are 4 distinct regular nilpotent
orbits. There are 20 distinct nilpotent orbits. The general theory also allows
us to determine the general orbits. The number of diﬀerent “types” of orbits
is 90. The term “type” will become clear in the course of the discussion below
leading to an explanation of the quantitative statement.
For each i = 1, 2, 3, 4 we deﬁne εi ∈V ∗by εi(vj) = δij. Let Φ = {±(εi +
εj)|1 ≤i < j ≤4} ∪{εi −εj|1 ≤i ̸= j ≤4}. Set ∆= {α1 = ε1 −ε2, α2 =
ε2 −ε3, α3 = ε3 −ε4, α4 = ε3 + ε4}. If s ∈a then we deﬁne Φs = {α ∈
Φ|α(s) = 0}. One can show that if s ∈a then there exists w ∈W such that
Φws = Φ∩spanZ(∆∩Φws). The main theorem implies that we need only look
at elements s satisfying
Φs = Φ ∩spanZ(∆∩Φs).
Here are the possibilities with |∆∩Φs| ≤1.
∆∩Φs = ∅, s = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j,
∆∩Φs = {α1}, s = x1(v1 + v2) + x3v3 + x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j,
∆∩Φs = {α2}, s = x1v1 + x2(v2 + v3) + x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j,
∆∩Φs = {α3}, s = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3(v3 + v4), xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j,
∆∩Φs = {α4}, s = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3(v3 −v4), xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j.
We note that the permutation (123) maps the set {s|s = x1(v1 + v2) + x3v3 +
x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj} for all i ̸= j bijectively onto the set {s|s = x1v1 + x2(v2 +
v3)+x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j}. Similarly, there is a permutation that maps
the set indicated by ∆∩Φs = {α2} onto the set indicated by ∆∩Φs = {α3}.

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
373
Finally, the sign change v1 →v1, v2 →−v2, v3 →v3, v4 →−v4 takes the
set indicated by ∆∩Φs = {α3} onto the set indicated by ∆∩Φs = {α4}.
Thus by the basic theorem we need only consider the ﬁrst two in our list. For
|∆∩Φs| ≥2 we will only list the cases up to the action of signed permutations
involving an even number of sign changes. Here are all of the examples
1. ∆∩Φs = ∅, s = x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j.
2. ∆∩Φs = {α1}, s = x1(v1 + v2) + x3v3 + x4v4, xi ̸= ±xj for all i ̸= j.
3. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α2}, s = x1(v1 + v2 + v3) + x4v4, x1 ̸= ±x4.
4. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α3}, s = x1(v1 + v2) + x3(v3 + v4), x1 ̸= ±x3.
5. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α4}, s = x1(v1 + v2) + x3(v3 −v4), x1 ̸= ±x3.
6. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α2, α3}, s = x1(v1 + v2 + v3 + v4), x1 ̸= 0.
7. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α2, α4}, s = x1(v1 + v2 + v3 −v4), x1 ̸= 0.
8. ∆∩Φs = {α2, α3, α4}, s = x1v1, x1 ̸= 0.
9. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α3, α4}, s = x1(v1 + v2), x1 ̸= 0.
10. ∆∩Φs = {α1, α2, α3, α4}, s = 0.
We now count the number of Gs orbits in Ns in each of the 10 cases above.
Case 1 yields 1 since Ns = {0}. Case 2 yields 2. Case 3 yields 3. Cases 4 and
5 yield 8. Cases 6, 7 and 8 yield 7. Case 9 yields 27. Case 10 yields 20. The
total is our promised 90.
Here are some examples. The extremes in case 10 of the list involving the
non-zero orbits are the 4 regular nilpotent orbits and the orbit of product
states
{u1 ⊗u2 ⊗u3 ⊗u4|ui ∈C2 −{0}}.
We now look at the so called WHZ state. This is (up to normalization) s =
|0000⟩+ |1111⟩= v1 + v2. It appears in case 9. Thus there are 26 additional
orbits with s-component the WHZ state. Here is how you ﬁnd them. We note
that

The space of all elements v ∈V such that [s, v]i = 0 for all i is spanned by s
and
{|0, 0, 1, 1⟩, |0, 1, 0, 1⟩, |1, 0, 0, 1⟩, |1, 0, 1, 0⟩, |1, 1, 0, 0⟩}.
Let
S1 = {|0, 0, 1, 1⟩, |1, 1, 0, 0⟩},
S2 = {|0, 1, 0, 1⟩, |1, 0, 1, 0⟩},
S3 = {|1, 0, 0, 1⟩, |0, 1, 1, 0⟩}.
Then the orbits corresponding to s are the orbits through s + 
j∈J nj where
J is a subset of {1, 2, 3} and nj ∈Sj. There are 27 such orbits. The orbits

with minimal stability groups are the ones corresponding to |J| = 3. There
are 8 of them.
We note that for 2 and 3 qubits the state |00...⟩+|11...⟩
√
2
was arguably the
most entangled. In the case of 4 qubits this state is just v1+v2
√
2
and so it is not
even in a′.
This discussion indicates that the measures of entanglement for 4 qubits
will form a complicated algebra. One useful invariant of such an algebra is the
Hilbert series.
5.2 Some Hilbert Series of Measures of Entanglement
If V is a real vector space then we set Pj(V ) equal to the complex vector space
of all polynomials on V that are homogeneous of degree j. If W is a complex
vector space, then Pj
R(W) = Pj(V ) where V is W as a real vector space. We
say that a subalgebra, A, of Pj
R(W) is homogeneous if it is the direct sum of
Aj = Pj
R(W)∩A. If A is a homogeneous subalgebra of PR(W) then the formal
power series
hA(q) =

j≥0
qj dim Aj
is called the Hilbert series of A.
The results we have described for 2 and 3 qubits imply that
hPR(C2⊗C2)K =
1
(1 −q2)3
and
hPR(C2⊗C2⊗C2)K = (1 + q4)(1 + q6)
(1 −q2)(1 −q4)6 .
As we predicted the case of 4 qubits is much more complicated. Here is
the series (see [W])
Numerator: 1 + 3q4 + 20q6 + 76q8 + 219q10 + 654q12 + 1539q14 + 3119q16+
5660q18 + 9157q20 + 12876q22 + 16177q24 + 18275q26 + 18275q28+

654q42 + 219q44 + 76q46 + 20q48 + 3q50 + q54
Denominator: (1 −q2)3(1 −q4)11(1 −q6)6.
5.3 A Measure of Entanglement for n Qubits
In this subsection we will describe a speciﬁc measure of entanglement intro-
duced in [M-W2] that has been used experimentally as test of entanglement.
We will give a formula for it in terms of representation theory and show how
it can be slightly modiﬁed to be an entanglement monotone.
Let V = C2 ⊗···⊗C2 n-fold product. We look upon V ⊗V as

C2 ⊗C2	
⊗
· · · ⊗

C2 ⊗C2	
. Let

Quantum Computing and Entanglement for Mathematicians
375
S : C2 ⊗C2 →S2(C2)
and
A : C2 ⊗C2 →C2 ∧C2
be the canonical orthogonal projections. If F ⊂{1, . . . , n} then we deﬁne pF
to be the product
R1 ⊗· · · ⊗Rn
with Ri = A if i ∈F and Ri = S otherwise. Then if v ∈V we have
v ⊗v =

|F | even
pF (v ⊗v).
The pF are orthogonal projections so we have in particular
∥v∥4 =

|F | even
∥pF (v ⊗v)∥2 .
We set
Υ(v) = ∥v∥4 −∥p∅(v ⊗v)∥2 .
The following result is not completely obvious. We will sketch a reduction to
the same assertion for another measure of entanglement.
Theorem 12. A state v ∈V is a product state if and only if Υ(v) = 0.
This measure of entanglement is related to one denoted Q in [MW2] (they
are the same for 2 and 3 qubits) and which was deﬁned as follows. If 0 ≤j <
N = 2n and j =
n−1

m=0
jm2m then if 0 ≤i < n deﬁne ti(j) =

0≤m<i
jm2m +

i<m<n
jm2m−1. If v =

0≤j<N
vj |j⟩then we set vi,0 = 
ji=0
vj |ti(j)⟩and vi,1 =

ji=1
vj |ti(j)⟩. Thus if
v = |111⟩+ |001⟩+ |010⟩+ |100⟩
2
then
v2,0 = |01⟩+ |10⟩
2
, v2,1 = |00⟩+ |11⟩
2
.
We set Q(v) =
n−1

i=0
∥vi,0 ∧vi,1∥2. Here in W ⊗W, u ∧w = u⊗w−w⊗u
2
and we
use the tensor product inner product. We note that Q

N.R. Wallach
We note that in [MW2] we proved the (relatively easy) result that the
Theorem above is true for Q replacing Υ. Since Q(v) = 0 if and only if
∥pF (v ⊗v)∥2 = 0 for all |F| > 0 and Υ has the same property. Hence Υ(v) = 0
if and only if Q(v) = 0.
In a forthcoming article we will prove that Υ is an entanglement monotone.
This essentially means that quantum operations (such as measurements and
local transformations) cannot increase its value. This condition is sometimes
included in the deﬁnition of a measure of entanglement.
