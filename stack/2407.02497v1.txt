Introduction
The Standard Model of particle physics has been wildly successful at explaining physical phe-
nomenon for the past fifty years. Over that time the theory has been filled in with various particles
and more accurate measurements of their interactions and masses, but the fundamental structure
has endured. Perhaps the most perplexing mystery within the Standard Model is why fermions,
described by Dirac spinors, exist in three generations—each generation having identical charges
with respect to the fundamental forces but different masses and mixings with respect to the Higgs
field. This tri-fold symmetry of fermion generations strongly indicates there is a finite symmetry,
triality, that acts in conjunction with the charge, parity, and time reversal symmetries of Dirac
spinors in the Standard Model. In this work, we introduce this symmetry in the context of C, P,
and T, and work out the group theoretical implications.
Dirac spinors are a foundational part of the Standard Model.
They are not, however, an
irreducible representation space of the spacetime spin group, Spin(1, 3). Rather, Dirac spinors
are an irreducible representation space of the spacetime pin group, Pin(1, 3), a double cover of
the spacetime orthogonal group, O(1, 3), and a subgroup of the spacetime Clifford group Cl∗(1, 3)
(consisting of invertible Clifford algebra elements).[1] The identity component of the spacetime spin
group is the spacetime orthochronous spin group, Spin+(1, 3) (the group of rotations obtained by
exponentiating Cl(1, 3) bivectors), equivalent to SL(2, C), and the double cover of SO+(1, 3).
The spacetime orthochronous spin group extends to the spacetime pin group by adding spatial
reflections, called parity conjugations (P), and temporal reflections, called time conjugations (T).
To summarize, we have:
Spin+(1, 3) ⊗{1, P, T, PT} = Spin(1, 3) ⊗{1, T} = Pin(1, 3) ⊂Cl∗(1, 3) ⊂Cl(1, 3)
Because the weak interaction maximally violates P-symmetry (interacting with only left-chiral
parts of fermions), many modern authors choose to disregard foundational P-symmetry, building
theories up from Weyl spinors in an irreducible representation space of SL(2, C) = Spin+(1, 3).
However, it is very likely that all fermions consist of both left and right-chiral parts that are related
by a P-symmetry that is broken but should still be considered foundational.
Pin(1, 3) group elements, U, act as Cl(1, 3) Clifford algebra elements on Dirac spinors, in
conjunction with corresponding active Lorentz transformations, Ψ(x) →UΨ(x′), and via the
Clifford adjoint on Clifford vectors and other Clifford algebra elements, A(x) →UA(x′) U−. The
Spin+(1, 3) subgroup elements of Pin(1, 3) consist of combinations of spatial rotations and Lorentz
boosts,
Uθ = e−1
2 γγ0n1θ = cos θ
2 −γγ0n1 sin θ
2
Uζ = e−1
2 γ0n2ζ = cosh ζ
2 −γ0n2 sinh ζ
2
which combine to make scalar plus bivector plus pseudoscalar (γ = γ0γ1γ2γ3) elements, U ∈
Spin+(1, 3). Alternatively, Clifford rotation elements can be constructed from successive Clifford
reflections. Using the pseudoscalar, the reflection of any Clifford element, A ∈Cl(1, 3), or spinor,
Ψ, through a vector, u, can also be written as a Clifford adjoint,
A′ = RuA = (uγ)A(uγ)−= (uγ)A(u−γ)
Ψ′ = RuΨ = (uγ)Ψ
– 2 –

Arbitrary Clifford reflections, as elements of Pin(1, 3), can be constructed by combining spacetime
rotations with a reflection through the unit time Clifford basis vector, UT = γ0γ = γ1γ2γ3, called
“time conjugation” (T), or reflection through the three unit space Clifford basis vectors, UP =
−γ1γγ2γγ3γ = γ0, called “parity conjugation” (P)—with the negative sign by convention—or their
combination, UPT = γ. These P and T symmetry conjugations anticommute, PT = −TP, and
close to form the PT Group (of order 8), a finite subgroup of Pin(1, 3). For Pin(1, 3) these satisfy
{U2
P = 1, U2
T = 1, U2
PT = −1}, while for Pin(3, 1) we have {U′2
P = −1, U′2
T = −1, U′2
PT = −1},
so these two pin groups are not isomorphic. Also note that Spin(1, 3) = Spin+(1, 3) ⊗{1, PT}.
Since we like working with Spin+(1, 3) because of the isomorphism to SL(2, C), but we would also
like our spinors to change sign under P 2, corresponding to a 2π rotation, as they do in Pin(3, 1),
we can fudge a bit by defining U′
P = iγ0, providing the best of both worlds. Physically, we appear
to live in a world with underlying Pin(3, 1) symmetry, but it’s easier to work with Pin(1, 3) for
calculations.
The spacetime pin group, Pin(1, 3), is in Cl(1, 3), and can be extended to the Dirac algebra via
an antiunitary charge conjugation (C) operator, UC = iγ2K (in which K is the complex conjugation
operator), acting on complex Dirac spinors—transforming between particles and antiparticles.
When we look at quantized fermion fields, T-symmetry becomes more complicated due to the
positive energy constraint. A different unitary time conjugation operator, UQ
T = γ13, is associated
with T-symmetry (T). And this is carried back to the unquantized arena by defining yet a different,
antiunitary time conjugation operator on Dirac spinors, U′
T = −iUT UC = γ13K, which we also
associate with T-symmetry (T), and we subsequently label the previous unitary T-symmetry, with
UT = γ0γ, as TU. Under their complex conjugations and Clifford multiplications, {UC, U′
P , U′
T }
generate the CPT Group (of order 16).[2] The projective action of the CPT Group on quantized
or unquantized Dirac spinors can be graphically depicted, using weights, as action on a cube.
Since the CPT Group is the split-biquaternion group, it is natural to re-identify Dirac spinors as
biquaternions, with corresponding C, P, and T actions on them.
In physics, P-symmetry is violated by the weak interaction, and CP-symmetry is violated by
the Yukawa interaction with the Higgs field, but CPT-symmetry holds, with CPT ∼PTU here, so
Spin(1, 3) = Spin+(1, 3) ⊗{1, PTU} is an unbroken symmetry of nature. In the Standard Model,
Dirac spinors are found in triplets, corresponding to three generations of each kind of fermion,
each combining with the others according to a mixing matrix to produce mass states. Given this
three-fold symmetry, it is natural to introduce a discrete triality symmetry (t) that cycles between
generations of Dirac spinors.
The main result of this paper is that there is a unique way to
nontrivially extend the CPT Group by triality to the CPTt Group (of order 96) while preserving
CPT-symmetry. This CPTt Group acts projectively on a 24-cell of Dirac spinor triplets.

Gravitational Weights of a Massless Quantum Dirac Spinor
Massless fermions are quantized excitations of Weyl spinors, which are the left or right-chiral halves
of Dirac spinors, corresponding to spinor representation spaces of the spacetime Lorentz algebra,
so(1, 3), described via the Cl(1, 3) Clifford algebra. Using Pauli matrices, the Weyl representation
of Dirac matrices (the Cl(1, 3) Clifford basis vectors) are:
γ0 = σ1 ⊗σ0
γπ = −iσ2 ⊗σπ
These representative matrices multiply to give six Clifford bivector basis generators of so(1, 3),
Jπ = 1
4ϵπρσγρσ = −i
2σ0 ⊗σπ
Kπ = 1
2γ0π = 1
2σ3 ⊗σπ
corresponding to spatial rotations and spacetime boosts. Identifying the antisymmetric Clifford or
matrix product of these with the Lie bracket, the nonzero brackets of the Lorentz algebra are:
[Jπ, Jρ] = ϵπρσJσ
[Jπ, Kρ] = ϵπρσKσ
[Kπ, Kρ] = −ϵπρσJσ
This Lie algebra structure of so(1, 3) is further elucidated by identifying basis elements of a Cartan
subalgebra, {J3, K3}, and computing the eigenvalues, j3 and k3, with imaginary and real root
coordinates, jI
3 and kR

A Dirac spinor corresponds to a fermion or anti-fermion with specific momentum and spin.
Massive fermions can be treated as massless fermions interacting with a Higgs field.
Massless
fermions have definite helicity, with aligned or anti-aligned spin and momentum. Solutions to the
massless Dirac equation, 0 = iγµ∂µΨ, are constructed from Pauli spinor helicity states, puχ± =
±χ±, corresponding to a momentum direction,
pu = pπ

Although we usually think of a massless Weyl spinor as determined by its momentum, it is
equally valid to consider a Weyl spinor state as primary, and use that to determine its momentum.
Via spectral decomposition, we have:
2 χ∓χ†

in which we have determined the left or right null four-vector and momentum direction from a left

to conjugations of a massless quantum Dirac spinor. The charge conjugate, ΨC = iγ2Ψ∗, is:

Composition of the C, P, and T operators produces the CPT Group, GCPT = Q8 × Z2, of order
16, equivalent to the split-biquaternion group. To understand this equivalence, we can identify
the charge conjugation operator, C ∼I, with a split-complex number, I2 = 1, which commutes
with parity and time conjugation operators identified with unit quaternions, P ∼e3, T ∼e2, and
PT ∼e3e2 = −e1. The resulting compositional multiplication table is:

Because fermions exist in three generations, we can introduce a natural fourth discrete con-
jugation operator, triality (t), that maps between generations and satisfies t3 = 1.
One non-
trivial extension of the CPT Group, GCPT = Q8 × Z2, to a group, GCPTt′, acting on three
– 10 –

generations of fermions, can be constructed by identifying a triality generator element, such as
t′ ∼−1
2(1 + e1 + e2 + e3).[3] This choice of triality generator, t′, commutes with the split-complex
generator, C ∼I, and cycles quaternion basis elements, such as t′e1t′2 = e2. This triality generator
extends the PT group, GPT = Q8, to the binary-tetrahedral group, GPTt′ = 2T, and including
charge conjugation via the split-complex generator gives the CPTt’ Group, GCPTt′ = 2T × Z2,
the split-binary-tetrahedral group, of order 48. Although this is mathematically correct, this is
not the only choice of group extension by triality. The Standard Model is not invariant under
charge conjugation, C, so it is not expected that our t symmetry should commute with C. It is
the case that the Standard Model is invariant under CPT, so what we need is to have different C,
P, and T representatives that don’t commute with our t, such that the resulting CPT generator
does commute with t. Rather than guess at such new group representatives, we can revisit the
operation of C, P, and T on Dirac spinors, and translate these to operations on biquaternionic
spinors.
A Dirac spinor describes both a fermion and an anti-fermion, via positive and negative energy
Dirac solutions, (2.1). This suggests a re-arrangement of degrees of freedom, using the charge

the Pauli matrices satisfy σ∗

in which we use the antiunitary time conjugation operator, U′

Group action on fermions, with quaternionic multiplication from the right. From these C, P, and
T generators we have CPT ∼−i.
We can now add a triality generator, t ∼−1
2(1 + e1 + e2 + e3), to those of our new C, P, and
T representatives and see that this does not commute with C and does commute with CPT. With
the addition of t, since we have PT ∼e2e3 = e1, and t cycles quaternions, we can also construct
an expression for the complex conjugation generator in terms of other generators, K ∼tPTttT.
This K generator commutes with P, T, and t, but anti-commutes with C.
It is antiunitary,
corresponding to complex conjugation of a Dirac spinor, ΨK = KΨ = Ψ∗, and corresponds to
creation conjugation on the infinite-dimensional representation space generators of QFT,

Creation conjugation changes particle annihilation into particle creation, mapping positive energy
states to nonphysical negative energy states. This is not considered a symmetry of nature—but it
is part of our symmetry group.
The CPTt Group, GCPTt, a finite group of order 96, is generated by:
C ∼ie1
P ∼−Ke3
T ∼−Ke2
t ∼−1
2(1 + e1 + e2 + e3)
(3.6)
It contains the eight unit quaternions, {±1, ±e1, ±e2, ±e3}, comprising a quaternion subgroup,
Q8, and the unit complex numbers and conjugation operator, {±1, ±i, ±K, ±iK}, comprising
a dihedral subgroup, D4, of order 8. It also contains the sixteen quaternionic Hurwitz integers,
1
2(±1±e1±e2±e3), which extend Q8 to the binary tetrahedral group, 2T, of order 24. The remaining
64 elements of GCPTt are compositions of these, with 2T and D4 both normal subgroups of GCPTt
combining non-trivially due to their shared −1. The PT subgroup, GPT = Q8, which extends by t
to GPTt = 2T, commutes with K, so there is a Z2 subgroup, comprised of {1, K}, such that 2T ×Z2
is a subgroup of GCPTt. Consulting GAP, of 231 finite groups of order 96, only one monolithic
group has both a 2T × Z2 and D4 subgroup—this is the CPTt Group, GCPTt = (2T × Z2) ⋊Z2
(GAP ID [96, 190]).[5]

Just as the CPT Group acts on 8 quantized Dirac fermion states projectively represented as
the CPT cube in three dimensions, with vertices corresponding to fermion weights, (ωS, h, q), the
CPTt Group acts on three generations of fermion states projectively represented as a 24-cell, which
lives naturally in four dimensions. For the four weight coordinates of the 24-cell we can choose
(ωt, ωS, h, q), in which ωt = 4ωShq is a Euclidean boost weight, such that the eight weights of one
fermion correspond to the weights of an octonion under so(8). In these coordinates the projective
group action changes the signs of the first generation fermions, by matrices, CI, PI, and TI, and
the second and third generation particles have weights related to the first via multiplication times
a triality matrix, t. The resulting CPTt Group projective representation generators are:

The weights of the second and third generation particles are necessarily nonsensical under direct
interpretation, but are correct—matching those of the first generation—when considered under
triality. Similarly, the action of C, P, and T on the second (and similarly on the third) generation
particles are by the matrices CII = tCIt2, PII = tPIt2, and TII = tTIt2. To better understand what
triality is and where this triality matrix comes from, we need to understand division algebras.[6]

(such as electron, muon, and tau) represented as a 24-cell, acted on by the CPTt Group. The CPT cube of
the 8 first generation states is shown with red edges, the second generation CPT cube in green, and third
generation CPT cube in blue. The three generations are linked by triality, t, shown in black, with second

Discussion
The fundamental symmetries of a massless quantum Dirac spinor are the charge (3.1), parity (3.2),
and time (3.3) conjugations of the corresponding creation and annihilation operators.
Charge
conjugation swaps particles and anti-particles, parity conjugation reflects momentum and swaps
left and right helicities (preserving spin), and time conjugation reflects momentum and swaps spin
(preserving helicity). These conjugations correspond directly to operations on Dirac spinors or the
corresponding biquaternionic spinors, and to projective actions on their weights. Time conjugation
must be handled especially carefully, via a unitary UQ
T = γ13 on Dirac spinors or an antiunitary
U′
T = γ13K operator that preserves the group structure. The finite group generated by these C,
P, and T conjugations is the CPT Group, GCPT = Q8 × Z2, equivalent to the split-biquaternion
group. This group acts projectively on the 8 weights of fermion states in the CPT cube.
Using an isomorphism to biquaternionic Dirac spinors, the C = ie1, P = −Ke3, and T = −Ke2
generators (3.5) of the CPT Group are extended by a quaternionic triality generator, t = 1
2(1 +
e1 + e2 + e3), commuting with the CPT generator, CPT = −i, to produce the monolithic CPTt
Group, GCPTt = (2T × Z2) ⋊Z2, of order 96. This group acts projectively on the 24 weights (the
vertices of a 24-cell) corresponding to three generations of a fermion type and its corresponding
CPT cubes. It is important to note that the weights (spins and charges) of the second and third
generation fermions described this way are nonsensical when considered as weights of the Lorentz
algebra acting on the first generation—they only make sense as weights related to first-generation
weights by triality.
The identification of triality, t, as a partner to C, P, and T symmetries, and the extension
to the CPTt Group, seems likely to be of fundamental importance in the Standard Model and its
unification with gravity. Although it is possible to trivially extend the CPT Group to a composite
CPTt Group, such as extending the CPT Group by S4, such extension seems unlikely to present
the rich and varied generational mixing in the Standard Model, and we prefer a more unified
model, with a monolithic CPTt Group.
In the complete Standard Model there are 8 fermion
types: neutrinos, electron-type leptons, three colors of up-type quarks, and three colors of down-
type quarks. In a unified theory (which includes right-handed neutrinos) these must correspond
to 8 disjoint 24-cells. The only current proposal for a unified theory that meets this criteria, with
a triality symmetry acting between 192 distinct fermion weights grouped into 8 disjoint 24-cells,
is E8 Theory.[7, 8]

fermion: neutrinos (gray), electron-type leptons (yellow), up-type quarks (red, green, and blue) and down-
type quarks (orange, chartreuse, and purple). Each 24-cell includes a triality-related triplet (connected by
gray lines, with second and third generation fermions shown with smaller glyphs) of 8 fermion states (cubes,
not shown) related by C, P, and T conjugations.
