TWF IIRPACY

PREFACE.
T WAS induced to project this Volume, from a desire to do honour to
Inverness, for I
Take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof
;
and
also
from
having been favoured
vi^ith
a
perusal
of
many-
valuable old papers connected with the Burgh—in their original
language and caligraphy
unintelligible to ordinary
readers—and
which are
nearly
all unknown to the
public, having never be-
fore appeared in print.
Subscribers will judge for themselves of the value of the work,
but I may be permitted to say,
that though it has been my chief
relaxation, during the intervals of arduous occupations, for the last
eight years, great pains have been taken to ensure the
correctness
of the papers.
I have to express my acknowledgments
to Mr Dallas, Town-
Clerk of Inverness,
for affording
facilities in the examination of
the Burgh Archives ; and in the
translations
so graphically ren-
dered, and in the general superintendence of the work, Mr Alex-
ander Eraser, Accountant, Inverness, has rendered most important
service.
The Chartulary of Moray has been largely drawn upon,
and
also Mr
Innes'
Histories
of
the
Families
of Cawdor
and
Ivilravock.
Among unpublished papers, I have had permission to make selec-
tions from the rich collections of Mackintosh of Mackintosh, and
EOBERTSON of lushcS.
As Inverness has improved greatly of late years in its buildino-s,
and will doubtless continue to do so, whereby in time all ancient
structures must disappear, I desired while there was yet time, to
preserve some of these memorials.
The
illustrations
first photo-
graphed
for
this book have
been
lithographed and engraved
to
my satisfaction by Mr Paterson of Edinburgh, and
will, I hope
be considered an attraction.
The typography
is worthy of the reputation of
the Inverness
Advertiser Office, inaugurated by the late lamented Mr E. Forsyth
and now sustained by his sons.

INYEENESSIANA.
I.
WILLIAM THE LION'S CHARTERS,
1165-1214.
PART FIRST.
Seeing that there is no history of Inverness worthy of the
name, it is intended from documents examined, and as the
results of reading, to give some papers, which may be useful
as materials for a proper history of the town and parish of
Inverness to the coming and desiderated historian.
No disappointment
will,
it
is hoped,
arise
from
these
papers beginning when written testimony
is
available
to
substantiate them.
At the same time, we have no objection
to say that having, at a very
early period, been instructed
in and giving implicit belief to such authentic
local
stories
as the
fairy
revels in Tomnahurich,
the
skeleton
finger
marks in Beauly Priory, and
the sleeping piper of Craig-
how
Cursed be the coward that ever he was born,
Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn,
it is very unlikely we should refuse a ready assent to such
time-honoured statements
as, that Inverness was founded
many years before the coming of Christ, that it was a town
of importance during the Roman occupation of Britain, that
it was the seat of the Pictish Government, that Gaelic was
the only language, and tartan the only dress at that
Court,
and the like.
It is unquestionable that there was a Royal Castle at In-
verness
prior
to the reign of Malcolm Canmore, and it is
generally admitted that it was Malcolm who
first erected a
castle on the present
site—former
castles having stood on
the Crown lands
;
afterwards known as " Auld Castle Hill."
The oldest Scottish towns are situated in the neighbourhood
brsuch castles— the original inhabitants having congregated
A

INVERNESSIANA.
under
the
walls
to
secure
themselves
from
reciprocal
injuries, and from the oppression of men of power.
Such
towns
were
called " Burgs," and
the
inhabitants
" Bur-
genses," long before their incorporation by charter.
These
burgesses paid a sum yearly
to
the King, having in return
various protections and privileges.
The first written privilege to the town of Inverness was
general,
and
included
the
whole
of William
the
Lion's
burgesses in the province of Moray
; but
in the year 1464,
it
w^as
recognised by James
III.
as
having
had
special
application to the Burgh of Inverness.
It is as follows
:
AVilliam, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to all Sheriffs and Bailies of his
"whole land, Greeting—Know ye that I have granted thisliberty to my Burgesses
of IMoray, that none whatever in my realm shall take a poinding for the debt of
any one, vinless for their own proper debt
:
"Wherefore, I
strictly
foi'bid any
one in my realm to take a poinding otherwise, upon my plenary prohibition.
AVitnesses—AVilliam
de Hay, Philip de
Valoniis, llichard my Clerk
of
the
Prebend, at Bonkhill.
The second charter was granted in the year 1180, and for
the first time a grant of lands for the support of the Burgh
was given—viz., " that land beyond the Burgh
called the
Burch halev (Burgh Haugh ?) namely—what is between tha
hill and the water," and in James VI.'s charter of 1591,
there
is added the words cum silvestri ^arca (with the wood
park.)
The position of this land has been a vexed question.
As
in
the great Pictish controversy both
sides agreed
in
nothing but the authenticity of the word
^^ Benval," so the
town's authorities, in their numerous litigations, sometimes
with the Duifs of Muirtown, sometimes with the Robertsons
of Inshes, and other neighbouring landholders, all admitted
that there were such lands, but differed toto ccelo where they
lay.
It was contended
for the town of Inverness in one of
their
latest
lawsuits
that
the
hill
referred
to was
Craig
Phadrick, and the lands those betwixt and the river.
But
on the other side it was argued that the
'' real Burgh Haugh
lies on the east
side of the
river Ness, and which Haugh
extends along that side of the river and is literally situated
iyiter montem et aquam, there actually being a range
of
hills
behind
it.
Moreover,
there
is a quantity of land in
this
direction to this day (1812), answering to the silvestris parca
of the
charter, and
consisting of property holding of the
town of Inverness, bounding the present Haugh, which be-
longs to the town."
Again, "...
the Burgh Haugh,
which was even more
accessible than the Merkinch, being
very near to the town, and on the same
side of the river,
and lying close to the Castle Haugh."
The town's contention was found erroneous by the House

INVERNESSIANA.
of Lords, and the Burgh Haugh, the
first land granted to
the town, now close on seven hundred years since, was that
part of Drummond known as Campfield, lying to the right
of the road leading from
Inverness by Drummond
Brae,
lately belonging
to the Drummond Park Company.
The
adjoining lands 'twixt the road to Dores and the river, known
as
the
Island Bank
lands,
also formed a portion
of the
Burgh Haugh.
It will be observed that while the King was to make a
fosse round the town, the burgh were to enclose with a good
"paling.
" The palissades" existed as a defence in 1689, but
we have not observed any notice of them afterwards.
King
William's fosse came
to an inglorious
end.
The last part
of it was
to the north-east of the town, along what is now
Academy Street.
When Inverness was the emporium of the
Highlands, and before trade was w^ell nigh extinguished by
the taxations following upon the Union, nearly all the land
to the east of Church Street was covered with malt-kilns and
tanpits, the refuse of which found
its way into the fosse.
The very word was latterly converted into the " fou" or foul
pool, and the ditch finally closed up as a nuisance which had
become intolerable.
No boundary in burghal titles occurs so
often as "the fosse or foul pool."
The names of the witnesses to the charters
w^ill be
scru-
tinised with interest.
These charters have not, we believe,
appeared in English before, and the translations now made
have undergone consideration and research.
King William's
second charter is thus
;
William, by the grace of God King of Scot?!, to all good men of his whole land,
clerical and laical ; Greeting
: Know
all present and to come, that
I have for
ever discharged all my Burgesses of Inverness from toll and all custom throughout
^\J,S'^^^
my whole land
: Wherefore, I strictly i^rohibit any one from taking toll or any
custom from them of their own Goods and gear, ni^on my plenary forfeiture.
I
also prohibit any one from buying or selling in that Burgh, or in that Sheriffdom
beyond the Burgh, or exercising any merchandise, unless he shall be a Burgess
of the said Burgh, or Stallager (Stallayarius), or shall do this by permission of
the Burgesses.
I have likewise given and granted to the foresaid Burgesses, for
the support of the Burgh, that land beyond the Burgh called the Burch halev
(Burgh Haugh?)—namely, what is between the hill and the water, so tha.t none
shall have wannage* (Vannaf/unn) or pasturage in
it unless by their license:
Moreover, the whole Burgesses have agreed with me that
I shall make a fosse
^ouna^the foresaid Burgh, that they shall enclose the whole Burgh within the
fosse with a good paling, and shall uphold that paling by which it
is enclosed,
and always keep it good and
entire.

WILLIAM THE LION'S CHARTERS,
PART SECOND.
1165-1214.
King
William's
first
charter
was,
it would have been
observed in our
last, signed at Bonkill, and the second at
Eren.
This was no doubt Boncle in the shire of Berwick,
now united to Preston.
The barony of Boncle and Preston
at one time belonged to the
Stuarts, ancestors of the royal
family.
The name
" Eren,"
though
involved
in some
obscurity, is generally thought to signify Auldearn.
William the Lion's
third charter was signed
at Elgin,
and by it
is preserved the name of the
earliest burgess of
Inverness, of whom
there
is account.
He was
Geoffrey
Blund, and from
his name no doubt a southerner, having
Bad
some connection with
the
Castle.
We would have
wished the name of the oldest recorded burgess to have been
Highland, but had
it been, there would in
all probability
have
been no
surname.
A considerable
time
after
this
period the Provost of Inverness was styled
^' John, the son
of Thomas."
The freedom from combat was a great privilege, as
trial
by judicial
combat
or
battle was
then
established
over
Europe.
A difficulty arises as to the privileges—" half the
oath and half the forfeiture"—which
is a strict interpreta-
tion of the original ; but it is conjectured that while a certain
number
of compurgators
or
witnesses
(vide
Pobertson's
Charles V.) were anciently required
to support
a
party's
oath
at the trial of his
cause,
the burgesses of Inverness
were to have the privilege of requiring one-half of the stated
number only.
Half the forfeiture would seem to mean half
the penalty or fine usually imposed.
It will be noted that one of the once powerful family of
Comyn is a witness, and the witness
described as
'^ Hugh,
his son,"
is not Hugh,
son
of Freskin,
ancestor
of the
Sutherlands— the true reading being Hugh, son of William,
son of Freskin.
He was known as Hugo de Moravia, Lord
ofDuffus, 1203-1226.
King William's third charter is as follows
:
William, by the grace of God King of Scots, &c.
; Greeting
: Know ye that we
have given, granted, and by this otir present charter confirmed to Geoffrey Blund,
our burgess of Inverness, and to his heirs, and to all our burgesses of Inverness
and their heirs, perpetual liberty that they shall never have coaibat among them,

INVERNESSIANA.
O
nor shall any other bui'gess, or any other man of our whole kingdom, have com-
bat with our said burgesses of Moray or with their heirs, save only on oath.
Moreover, I have granted to my said burgesses of Moray and their heirs that
they may make half the oath and half the forfeiture which my other burgesses
make in my whole kingdom, and they shall be free of
toll throughout my whole
kingdom for ever.
AVitnesses—Earl David my brother (Duncan), Earl of Fife,
"Justiciary of Scotland, Gilbert Earl of Stratherne, Hugh, Chancellor, John do
Asting, Philip de Valoniis, William Cumyn, Peter de Pollock, William son of
Freskin, Hugh his son, and William his son, at Elgin, the second day of May.
One of the first points in William's fourth charter which
will
attract the reader's
attention
is the appointment of a
market day in Inverness— viz.,
^^ the Sabbath day in every
week."
There are many worthy people who would on no
account use the word " Sunday," conscientiously attributing
something sacred
to
the word
*^ Sabbath."
Such labour
under a delusion, the word signifying " Seventh"
day, the
day
of
rest, and
they ought
to
prefix
the
words
'^ the
Christian"
Sabbath
to
express
correctly
the
meaning
intended
to be conveyed.
Even apart from
religious obli-
gation, economic necessity demands the observance of a day
of rest.
Headers must
not come
to
the conclusion that
King William was a profane person, for the market day he
appointed at Inverness (diem Sabbati) was really the seventh
day
of
the
week,
our
Saturday.
In
ancient
writings,
especially legal documents, Sunday is universally translated
" dies Soils" or " dies Doininica"
Numerous references will be found in this charter to the
assizes of David
1st, the King's grandfather, and some of
these will be given in our next, concluding for the present
with William's fourth charter :—
William, by the grace of God King of Scots,
to the bishops,
abbots, earls,
barons, justiciaries, sheriffs, provosts, ministers, and all good men of his whole
realm, clerical and laical
; Greeting
: Know all present and to come that I have
appointed, a market-day in my burgh of Inverness—viz., the Sabba.th-day (diem
SdUbati) in every week, and have duly granted my sure peace to all who shall
come to my market of Inverness
; and I strictly forbid that any one shall unjustly
presume to cause any injury, molestation, or hindrance to those who shall come
to my market, either in coming or returning, upon my plenary forfeiture.
I
have also granted to my burgesses, who shall inhabit my burgh of Inverness, all
laws and righteous customs, which my other burgesses dwelling in my other
burghs of Scotland enjoy ; and that none within the Bailiary of Inverness shall
beyond my burgh, make cloth, dyed or cut, contrary to the assize of King David,
, , ~
.
\
my grandfather, and my own
; and if any cloth shall be found to have been dyed, v^'-^^'^j''^
cut, or made, contrary to this my prohibition, I charge my Sheriff of Inverness
to seize that cloth, and to deal therewith as was the custom and
assize in the
time of King David, my grandfather, unless
it shall happen that
I may have
given such liberty to any one by my charter.
I also
strictly forbid any one to
buy or sell beyond my burgh anything which
is contrary to the assize of King
David, my grandfather, and my own.
I likewise strictly forbid that any t9,vern
be kept in any country town beyond my burgh, unless in a town where a knight
laird of the town may be staying, and then a tavern may be kept there according
to the assize of King David, my grandfather, and my own.
I therefore strictly
charge my bailies of Inverness, as well as my foresaid burgesses of Inverness, to
be aiding, and that they compel
all to observe properly the aforesaid righteous
customs of the burgh
; and I forbid any one to presume to oppress unjustly my
foresaid burgesses contrary to the foresaid reasonable laws and customs, upon

III.
WILLIAM THE LION'S CHARTER.
1165-1214.
PART THIRD,
LAWS OF THE BURGHS.
Besides the four charters already quoted, King William,
it would appear, granted the Burgesses
of Elgin, Forres,
and Inverness
certain
privileges of pasturing
their
cattle
and cutting fuel in his forests, as is seen by the reservation
contained in the following charter
:
AVilliam, by the grace of God King of Soots,
to the bishops,
abbots,
earls,
barons, justiciars, sheriffs, provosts, ministers, and all good men in all his land,
clergy and laity
; Greeting
: Know now and in all time to come, that I have given
granted and by this my charter confirmed, to Richard, Bishop of Moray, that he
may build his mill upon my land of Upper Crokas, which is beyond the Lossie,
under the Castle of Elgin.
I have also granted, and by this my charter con-
firmed, to the said Bishop Richard and his successor's for ever, that of
all my
wood in Moray which
is Avithin my forests about Elgin, Forres, and Inverness,
they and their dependants may have the free use for timber and fuel, for their
own
peculiar
uses
without
trouble or molestation,—also that none
of their
neighbours take anything thence without their permission.
Nor farther shall
any of my foresters be allowed to give or
sell anything from the foresaid woods
unless they will it.
Reserving however to my Burgesses of Elgin, Forres, and
Inverness, the Easements they used to have in the time of my grandfather King
David, or the time of my brother King Malcolm, or my own time.
I have also
granted to the said Bishop Richard that he may peaceably feed his cattle in the
said wood, as also the pasture money for the cattle of his followers.
I have also
granted to the said Bishop Richard and his successois for ever, that they may
have for themselves and their followers pasturage in the foresaid wood as freely
and fully as their predecessors had in the time of the King my grandfather, or
King Malcolm my brother, or during my own time.
Wherefore I firmly prohibit
any of my foresters or any other, to inflict any injury, hindrance or molestation
on the foresaid Bishop Richiird or
his successors in any of the
tilings above
written which I have granted to them, and by this my charter confirmed, under
pain of my high displeasure.
Witnesses—Earl David my brother, Hugh my
Chancellor,
A.
Abbot
of
Dunfermline,
Jo.
:
Archdeacon
of Dunkeld,
Eai'l
Duncan, Earl Patrick, Earl Gilbert, Gil.
: Earl of Mar, Richard of the Prebend,
Allan son of Walter the Steward, Robert de Lend, William Comyn, William
son of Freskyn, Hugh his son, William de Lascel, Peter de Police.
At Forres.
That the King possessed some land within
the limits of
the burgh of Inverness, is evidenced by the following charter
in favour of the foresaid Bishop Richard
:
William, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all good men of his whole realm,
clerical and laical
; Greeting
: Know ye that
I have given and granted, and by
this my charter conbrmed, to Richard Bishop of Moray and
his
successors, in
free and perpetual alms, one toft in Banff, one in Cullen, one in Elgin, one in
Forres, one in Auldearn, one in Inverness, to be held, said tofts, as quietly fully

INVERNES8IANA.
and honourably
as other Bishops of my realm hold freely quietly fully and
honourably their tofts in any of my buvghs.
Witnesses —Hugh my Chancellor,
A. Abbot of Dunfermline, Earl Duncan, Earl GiU)cvt, Richard my Clerk of the
Prebend,
"William son
of Freskin,
Peter de Polloc, William de
Laceles.
At
Elgin.
That William visited Inverness is proved by the following
curious charter
in favour
of^ John the Hermit.
Lunnin is
believed to be Dunlichity ; but though there be a small lake,
where is the island ?
William, King of Scots, to the bishops, abbots, earls, barons, justiciars, sheriffs,
and all good men in his whole land
; Greeting
: Know that I have gianted, and
by this my charter contirmed, to John the Hermit (Johanni
hcrcinite.) the gift
which Simon Bishop of Moray at my request gave him, viz,
: the island which
is in the lake of Lunnin at the East, and half an oxgate of land in Duldauach.
Wherefore I will and tirndy deeiee that the foresaid John, so long as he shall
live, shall freely quietly and without molestation hold tlie foresaid lands as the
charter of the said Bisliop testifies and confiims.
Witnesses—Llatthew Bishop
of Aberdeen, Andrew Bishop of Caithness, Gregory Eishoi> of E,oss, Earl Wal-
thew, Earl Duncan, Bichard
de Bloicvil
Con.stidile, William son
of Frcskyn,
Walter de Berkeley, Bichard the Clerk.
At Inverness.
The Sheriff of Inverness was an important officer as early
as the time of David
I.
(1124-1153), for
it
is recorded in
his laws, that " if he who
is
challenged, passes and goes
for
his warrant dwelling
in Moray
or in Ross,
or in any
other of the bounds
or
places
pertaining
to
Moray, and
cannot find or apprehend his warrant,—he shall pass to the
Sheriff of Inverness, and the
Sheriff shall send with him
the King's
servants, who shall see
that he be righteously
treated and handled conform to the law of the land."
In the time of the same King, Gowrie
at
Scone, Stor-
month at Cluny, Athole at Raitt, Fife at Dalguish, Strathern
at Perth, Angus at Forfar, Mar and Buchan
at Aberdeen,
Ross and Moray
at Inverness,
are declared the
chief and
principal places
of the countries of Scotland, benorth the
Forth, through all the realm.
We now proceed to give some of the laws of the burghs
;
and
1.
Tlie Courts.—There were three head
courts within the
burgh:— 1st, after the Feast of Michaelmas;
2d, after the
Nativity of our Lord
;
3d, after Pasche ; and each burgess
not present without lawful excuse for his absence had to pay
a fine of four pennies.
2.
Pilgrims and
Travellers.—A burgess in pilgrimage,
or
in countries beyond the seas on
his lawful
affairs, had the
privilege that no legal proceedings were valid against him
until his return
;
and, with regard
to the families and pro-
perty of pilgrims,
'' If any burgess is passed in pilgrimage
with license of the Kirk and of his neighbours to the Holy
Land, or to St James, or to any other holy place, his house
and all his haill proper family, shall be in the peace of the

8
INVERNESSIANA.
King, and of the Provost and Bailies, until God bring him
home again."
3.
Watching and Warding.—Furth of each house inhabited,
a man should come to watch for fear of peril, who shall pass
from door to door, with a staff in his hand, and shall be of
man's
age.
And when curfew
is rung
in, he
shall come
forth with two weapons, and shall watch
carefully and dis-
creetly
till the morning
; and if he
fails
therein, he
shall
pay an unlaw of four pennies.
4.
Measures
and
Weights.—The
rood
of
land
within
a
burgh was 20
feet
; within a barony it was
6
elns, or 18
feet.
The eln wand regulated measures.
The weights were
stone and pound
; and the eln wand, stone, and pound, were
sealed with the standard of the burgh.
/ We conclude with the mode of dealing with people who
had been beaten until they were " black and blue," a saying
of respectable antiquity
:
'' If a man strikes another, and
makes him blae and bloudie, he that
is blae and bloudie
should be first heard, if he comes first, and makes his com-
plaint, for he should be
first heard whose skaith
is most
notorious.
And
if they be both blae and bloudie he who
accuses
first, shall be first heard."
These old laws
are
most
interesting, and
an
intimate
acquaintance with them will throw much light on. points of
present importance.
IV.
WILLIAM THE LION'S REIGN.
1165-1214.
PART LAST.
It is recorded by Lesleus, Bishop of Ross, that
^^ Richard
King of England (for Henry died while these things were
being done) furnished an expedition to the Holy Land, and
demanded from William a subsidy of ten thousand pounds
towards the expedition."
Part of this money was contributed
by Inverness
; and,
at the same
time, and
in honourable
consequence, the King granted arms, whereof the supporters
are an elephant and camel, to denote their connection with
the east, with our Saviour on the cross
in the centre.
The
town's
arms
were
re-matriculated
about
the
end
of the
seventeenth century.
In the year
1163,
the
Mackintosh history
relates that

INVERNESSIANA,
9
Shaw, second son of Duncan, third Earl of Fife, came north
with Malcolm IV.,
^'and for his services done against the
rebels in that expedition, was in the year 1163 rewarded by
the King with the Constabulary of the Castle of Inverness,
and the possession and command of the hinds and people of"*
Pettie,
Bracklie, and the forestry of Strathearn ;" and of
Shaw the second, son of the above,
it
is
said, " that when
Donald
of the
Isles had invaded
the
lands
of Eoss and
*
Moray, with a great power, and had made
several
assaults
against the
Castle of Inverness,
this Shaw
is recorded to
-
have carried himself, so as for his fidelity and manhood in
defending the Castle against the enemy, he was not only
established in his
father's possessions by a new right, but
also he was made Chamberlain of all the King's revenues in
these
parts
during
his
lifetime ;"
also,
Shaw's
youngest
brother,
" Duncan,
was
killed
in
the
country's
defence
against the
Islanders, near Inverness;
an.
1190."
There
is thus no family so long connected with the town and parish
of Inverness, as that of Mackintosh.
The
earliest reference made
to Inverness
ecclesiastically
occurs in a charter to Aberbrothoc, dated about 1170, where
the name of " Thomas,
Priest and Parson of Inverness,"
occurs (Tliome sacerdoti ejusdem ecclesice parsonce).
It is, there-
fore, obvious
that there must have been laymen, who had
^ the name and revenue of the parson, but who did not possess
the
priestly
function.
The name
'' Rogero de
Inuernys"
occurs in a charter, dated 1190 by Richard, Bishop of Moray,
in favour of William, son of Freskin, of certain lands within
the Barony of Duffus.
This Roger
is
also one of the wit-
nesses to a charter of protection by the said Bishop Richard
betwixt 1187 and 1203 to the Monastery of Kinloss, of their
various lands
; and amongst
others,
of three tofts, one in
Elgin, one in Forres, one in Inverness—the gift or donation
of King Malcolm—and five shillings of feu farm furth of his
three
tofts
in Elgin,
Forres,
and
Inverness—the
gift
of
Allan Durward.
These grants were renewed and confirmed
by Alex.
11. , in 1225.
It may be as well here to classify the tenure of the various
lands within the parish of Inverness.
1st.
Ohurcli Lanclfy-
The Bishop of Moray had the barony of Itinmylies
in the
parish of Inverness, with other lands, conferred upon him
by Alexander 11. in 1232.
This included the whole of the
parish of Inverness on the west side of the river Ness to the
march with Dunean, except the lands of Merkinch granted
to the burgh, and
that small part of the town across the
river still burghal, of which Young Street may be taken as
B

the
centre.
2d.
Castle Lands.—These
varied
at
different
periods, but a pretty full enumeration
is
to be found in a
Crown discharge to the Earl of Huntly in 1532, where it is
stated that the Earl " has
the following lands
in
fee
for
keeping of our Castle of Inverness
:—Little Hilton, Porter-
field,
Meikle
Hilton,
Castletown
of
Lathir,
Culduthel,
Knocknagail, Torbreck, Balrobert, Essich, Tordarroch, Bun-
achton, Duntelchaig, Bochruben, Duneancroy, Duneanmor,
Dochgarroch,Dochnalurg,T3ochfour,Dochcairn,Dochnacraig,
with the fishing under the Castle
Hill, &c."
The lands
of
Aultnaskiach and Easter and Wester Haughs, though Castle
lands, are not, it will be observed here, specially enumerated,
and some of the lands are in the parishes of Croy and Dores.
The whole of the parish of Bona was
Castle land, with the
exception of Easter and Wester Abriachan, which was
in-
cluded in
the
grant of
Kinmylies.
3d.
Town's Lands.'—
These were the lands granted by various monarchs down to
the time of James VI., and comprehended what is known as
*•' the
territory of the burgh of Inverness."
No doubt the
town has lost a deal of
its grants, but at same time many
unclaimed
subjects, within a pretty wide
circle, have been
taken possession of.
The principal lands held in feu of the
town are a considerable portion of the
estate of Inshes, of
Castle
Hill,. Drakies, Bogbain, Drummond, Burnside, &c.
4th.
Croion Lands.—These were granted and forfeited so often
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
correct
idea,
seeing
the
numerous changes.
They
consisted of lands held from the
Crown direct, conferring the right of freeholders upon the
possessors.
At one period this class was very numerous In
the
parish, and the
charter
to Kinmylies,
which
will be
given on a future occasion, has been quoted in support of
the view that the word " thane" was sometimes
used in
reference to a king's tenant.
In the preface to the printed
edition of the Chartulary of Moray, it is said
It would appear that the whole district of Moray having lapsed to the Crown,
whether by
forfeiture
or
otherwise,
while many
portions were
granted by
Malcolm and William, and their immediate successors in frank tenement or
baronage,
subject only to the burden
of
military service ;—a large part
still
remained the property of the Sovereign, who granted
it either on lease for a
limited period, or in perpetual feu farm, for the payment of a certain money
rent.
There is sufficient evidence in this chartulary that the feuars or perpetual
tenants, even of small portions of these Crown lands, bore the title of Thane.
These words are not only used synonimously, but the precise relation is marked
in more than one place, which the thane bore to the villain on the one hand, and
the dominus, or lord of a fief, on the other.
There is reason to believe that the
administrators or stewards of certain portions of Crown lands, and sometimes
even the tenants removable at pleasure, were also designated thanes.
The principal lands held of the Crown in the parish in
later years were, the barony of Culcabock,
at one time the

INVERNESSIANA.

property of the Grants, but for a long period part of and
incorporated into Inshes,part of Castle Hill, part of Culloden,
the part of Holm
belonging
to
the
Earl
of Moray,
&c.
When the Church lands and Castle lands in time came
to
be
sold,
the new proprietors, getting their charters
direct
from the Crown, became also freeholders.
V.
THE CHURCH IN INVERNESS IN THE REIGNS OF
WILLIAM THE LION AND ALEXANDER THE SECOND.
PART FIRST.
After the introduction of Christianity into
Scotland, the
services
of religion and instruction were
administered by
pious men, styled the servants of God.
The term ^fCuJdee^
has
been
attributed
to
Gaelic
and
Latin
origin^
b
languages giving the above meaning.
They had no regular
stipends, but depended upon voluntary offerings, while their
churches and seminaries were established by the piety of
their hearers, and in honour of the more celebrated of their
saints.
The clergy under the Eomish system were of two classes,
regular and secular.
The former very soon monopolised all
the revenues, and the actual parochial work was devolved
upon " vicars," because they acted in vice or place of the
parson,
prelate,
or monastery.
The
vicar's appointment
was at first temporary, but afterwards became a permanent
ecclesiastical appointment, with a cure of souls.
The teinds
were of two kinds, the greater, viz., of corn, wheat, barley,
oats, pease, &c., and the lesser, viz., the produce of animals,
such
as lamb, wool, milk,
flax,
cheese,
or the like.
The
greater teinds are also known as parsonage teinds, being due
by law
to the
rector,
or parson, serving the
cure, and the
lesser are known as vicarage teinds appropriable by the vicar.
A learned writer,
depicting the
state of the Church
at
and preceding the reign of James I., says
:
Church benefices -were only considered as posts of honour, or profit, to which
men did aspire by all the basest methods of sinning and servile compliances, and
when they were possessed
of them,
all
their thoughts were taken up with
intrigues of State, and how to serve and gratify their own ends of pleasure and
ambition.
It
is incredible to what degree corruptions and abuses were carried
by resignations, unions, and commendams, dispensing with pluralities, and non-
residence, and making bishops and abbots of the ignorant children of noblemen.

12
INVERNESSIANA.
Another
writer,
speaking
of the Reformation,
says :—
*^ When the storm came, the secular clergy were degraded
and powerless, the regulars eating the bread of the parish
ministers,
themselves
idle
or
secularised, could
not
be
defended."
These remarks
are necessary in order to understand the
grant of the Church„of Inverness after quoted.
Tb:6" Bislioprick of Moray^as founded in the end of the
reign of ATexanderiE;yT)rifeginning of that of David L, the
first Bishop found on record being named Gregory ; but the
first Bishop who received any grant of lands, was Simon
4th in order, who was elected in 1171 and died in 1184.
There were four Deaneries within the diocese,
viz., those
of Elgin,
Inverness,
Strathbogie, and
Strathspey,
which
may be held as of the nature of Presbyteries.
In Inverness
itself there was generally only a vicar, though occasionally
the name of Parson of Inverness and Dean of Inverness
is
to be met with.
The comparative value of the vicarages of
Inverness with other churches
in the north, may be seen
from Baiamond's Taxed Roll of Benefices, framed about the
year 1275 for the use of the Pope, thus
:—Yicaria de Inuer-
nesse, £5
;
the Deanery of Moray, £21
6s 8d ;
Croy, £4
;
Moy, £3:
Yicaria de Elgin, £3 6s 8d;
Pettie, £6 13s 4d;
Kingussie, £6 13s 4d;
the Deanery of Ross, £8;
Kintail,
4s 4d
;
Dingwall, 4s 4d
;
Tain, £4.
Besides
individuals, certain churches were profusely en-
dowed, to
the scandal and impoverishment of the Church
generally.
Thus the monastery of Arbroath, dedicated to
the fashionable High Church
saint, Thomas a Becket,
re-
ceived in the reign of William the Lion grants of no fewer
than 33 parish churches, one of them being Inverness.
So far as we are aware, the first reference made to Inver-
ness ecclesiastically, in any document now extant, is contained
in the following charter by William the Lion in favour of
the Church of St Mary of Inverness, and must have been
granted 'twixt the years 1164-1171.
As there are no bounds
defined,
it
is impossible
to say where the plough of land
then granted, lay.
Follows the charter
:<
William, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all good men of his whole land ;
Greeting
: Know that I have given and granted to God, and the Church of Saint
Mary of Inuii-nys, and Thomas,, priest, parson of the said church, one plough of
land in i^erpetual mortification.
Wherefore I will that the foresaid Thomas hold
the

13
family of Panmure, was in the highest degree improper
; and
it is no wonder that
after the death of Thomas, who was
both
parson
and
priest,
the poor
vicar
Eustachius, who
appears
to have succeeded, had various questions with St
Thomas
Church,
which
well
nigh
starved
him.
Its
managers were
truly—in a graphic, but
scarcely
elegant
expression of a northern ecclesiastic—" stipend-lifters," and
had to answer for their doings before the Pope.
It was a
constant aim of the Papacy
to encourage appeals even on
trifling jjoints, in order the more to establish its sway.
The
following is a translation, from
the Ethie MS. and the old
register, of the King's gift of the Church of Inverness, and
would have been granted 'twixt 1189-1199
:

The questions 'twixt the Yicar of Inverness and St Thomas

were
referred
by
the
Pope
to
the
amicable decision and award of the Bishop of Moray, who^
upon the ith February 1248, not long before the death of
Alexander the Second, issued and promulgated the following
foundation or endowment of the vicarages of Inverness and

It wiUJbe.observed^that the Vicar was to have
his
resid.-
ence adjoining the church, which the Yicar was
recently; in
possession of, and iTts particularly interesting to the writer
td~^now That" after
the lapse of six hundred years, while
endeavouring to preserve some authentic information
as
to
the early history of the church in Inverness, he writes these
papers, -4hough^Qat^within
its
walls,
still upon the
site of
the Vicar's_Mans(
In'^e year 1787 a considerable portion of the burgh was
sold by the authorities, under the statute relating to ruinous
tenements within the burgh, and amongst others an area of
ground upon the
east
side of Church
Street, .^escribed
as
^^ formerly the Second
Minister's,
or Vicm^-Mwm^b
The
authorities
perhaps did well to
give the subject this
alter-
native designation, because, some years
prior,
it
and
the
property, now
the
manse of the
minister
of
the
North
Church, had
been
the
cause
of
great
litigation
in
the
Supreme
Courts.
About the
time
of
the
usurpation,
a
second^ niinister in Inverness-was-settled, who was provided
with a manse.
The first minister had received the Vicar's
Manse after the Eeformation from the Magistrates of Inver-
ness, to whom had been granted, inter alia, the churches and

INVERNESSIANA.
15
other ecclesiastical property in the comprehensive charters
of Queen Mary, and in especial of James VI.
These manses having fallen into disrepair, the two ministers,
about the year
1775, applied
for
their being rebuilt, or at
least put into a tenantable condition.
Mr Robert Rose was
then
first minister, and possessed the Free North Manse,
while Mr Fraser possessed Mr Fraser-Mackintosh's house.
The
heritors
objected, and Mr Fraser being an
old man,
withdrew his claim
; but as Mr Rose persisted, the heritors,
among other defences, stated that he was
not in iDossession of
the original manse, which, if there were any obligation to
rebuild,
attached to it alone, and not to the second manse,
which was
originally
built
by
subscription.
In vain Mr
Rose argued at great length and with much ingenuity that
his manse was the Vicar's Manse, and deduced the whole
succession of ministers who had occupied it
;—the titles did
not bear out his contention, and after years of litigation the
matter was dropped.
Upon looking over the papers, there
can be no doubt the heritors were right
in
their view, and
the singular fact of the first minister having come to occupy
the second manse, must have arisen in this way, that being
a newer building erected in
1648,
some
second minister
promoted
to the
first charge had not quitted
his
manse.
The
effect of the
litigation was
that
both
manses were
abandoned and afterwards
sold
as ruinous tenements.
It
may be here observed that at present, and
for a very long
time
past,
the
glebes
of the
two
ministers have
in like
manner been changed.
It will be
also observed that the Yicar of Inverness was
taken bound to cause service to be decently performed in
the said church of Inverness and its chapels. A field beyond
Rose Street was known formerly as "St Thomas Chapel,"
no doubt from
St Thomas
of Aberbrothock.
" St
Giles'
Chapel" was either attached to or very near the church, and
from^^ertainpapers dated in 16£2^ it
is ^evident Jijmt-tliejja
weFe tw^^^Bu]Jiim|g^—chiKcIies or aisl^^:^ujed^aXthat time.
In a beautiful view^oTInvefness In the year 1680, of wliicIS
copies are in possession of the Rev. Dr Macdonald and Mr
Fraser-Mackintosh,
the church
is a
distinct
object.
The
present square tower is precisely as it now is, but the
spire
is
different, and the tower appears not at the end of the
church, but rather to its west,
or river
side.
Some inter-
esting particulars of the old High Church—described in 1769
ty the magistrates of the day as of such great age that no
particulars of its building were known—are furnished by
John Maclean, the Inverness
centenarian, who had
often
heard service within it.

So when your petition presented to us set forth that
our venerable brother, the

of Moray,
having
carefully weighed
the
capabilities, and with the consent of his chapter, taxed the jjerpetual vicarages
of Inverness and Aberkerder, and certain other churches of the diocese of Moray
(over which you have the right of patronage, and which, by the authority of the
apostolic chair, you hold for your own uses), as is said to be more fully contained
in the

Of Kin^ Alexander, Lord Hailes
says—^^That he
was
t^^^^
one of the wisest Princes that ever reigned over Scotland,"
^ and in another place
that
" Alexander had
a
particular
kindness for the mendicant friars of the order of St Dominic,
called with us the Black Friars.
,
For them^ he founded no
\
fewer than eight monasteries, at Edin Burgh, Berwick, Ayr,
Perth, Aberdeen, Elgin, Stirling, and Inverness."
Cardonel, in his Picturesque Antiquities of Scotland, says
of
the
order
Fraires
Prcedicatores—on
account
of
their
frequent preaching,
^^ that
according
to
their
rules,
the
brethren renounced all worldly possessions, abstained from
eating
flesh from September
to
Easter.
They lay neither
in feather-beds nor in sheets, but on a mattress
; and every

day, they were to say the office of the Virgin Mary.
Their
habit was a white gown and scapular."

be traced, and also in the year 1240 a charter from Alex-
ander,
which was described in the year 1530
as appearing
^' frcm

and partly
spoiled."
This
interesting charter
is
in these
terms
:
Alexander, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all good men

At Berwick,

The
first subject conveyed appears
rather
strange,
the
King's Highway.
Some light is thrown upon
this
gift by
a somewhat similar gift by Alexander in the year 1230
to
the same
Friars in Edinburgh, of a
street,
so well known
for ages— Black
Friars' Wynd—but in that case,
the con-
dition was annexed
^^ that the
said
Friars may, as
it shall
seem expedient,
construct
or erect houses or buildings
in
the foresaid street or passage, which is called the venelle."
Though the words in the charter to Inverness are

to DQake

or
in order to he
annexed to their adjoining lan^.
The vast differences now presented by the grounds from
what they were at the period
in
question, may be
to some
extent realised from there being a grant of an island to the
north of their land, and the only grant whose
limits can
_
now be traced with any certainty is that of the fishing.
It
u^/^-^^
will be observed
that the north boundary
is
described as -si

This, however,
denotes
" Cherry,"
which
is
well known as the next lowest shot to the
Friar's
Shot on
the
river
Ness.
There
was
considerable litigation about
the year 1774 as to the
limits of the various
fishings, and
arising therefrom a plan was prepared by Mr Home,
sur-
veyor, who laid down in a very
full manner the course of
the river below the old stone
bridge, with copious names.
Among these names, those of Crea-in-uisk, Martin's Cairn,
Don Henry's, Paule, Fortfield (now Dr Monro's Park) and
others, are not now commonly used.

Siibsequent grants
were .made,
and. „c5liarters_.giYeiiJby
RoLort Bruce, David II., and James V.^ which will be noted
aT tlie
proper time.
In
the
meantime, we have only
to
express our deep regret that
a
charter by
the Prior and
Monastery of a slated house in Bridge
Street
in
the year
1517 in favour of an ancestor of Mr Robertson
of Inshes,
has been mislaid in Edinburgh within
the
last few years.
It would serve to show the constitution of the Monastery,
and by a letter dated
in 1789 from a gentleman in Kelso,
to whom Arthur Robertson of
Inshes had lent
itj it had
then attached the seals of the governing body.
Of the Monastery there now remains but^art jof a single
column.
With reference to the mutilated
stone~~figur'e~for
some time lying in the Dunain portion of the Grey
Friars'
Burying-Ground,
inserted
in the wall a few years ago on
the writer's
suggestion, John Maclean,
the Inverness
his-
torian, says
Near the east end of the building was a splendid monumental
effigy of the
Regent Moray, the great favourer of the Reformation in Scotland.
He held
Courts in Inverness in 1570, to which he had obtained the hereditary Sheriffdom,
after the defeat of the Earl of Huntly.
The sculptured effigy rejiresented the
Regent lying on a couch, with his hand reposing on a bible, the book from which
history informs us he was wont to have portions daily read in his palace.
As
the patron of the Scottish Reformation, the memory of the Regent was disliked
by the Romanists, and on the arrival of the Pretender at Inverness in 1715
(?)
his partizans of that denomination, thinking of course that Romanism would
thenceforth be in the ascendant, they gave a veiy significant sign of their antici-
l^ations and hopes by proceeding one night to the Grey
Friars', and destroying
the monument, which they threw down, breaking the arms and
leaving the
effigy a headless stump.
The body, with the legs of the
effigy, however, still
remain, and may be seen by the curious.
The above is valuable as showing that tradition connected
the figure with the family of Moray
; but there was no cause
whatever why there should have been a handsome monu-
ment erected at Inverness to the Regent, who was buried
at St
Giles', Edinburgh.
As we find that
John^jStiiart,
Pnor^tjColdinghame,
the
Earl's
natural brother,
died at
Inverness in the year 1563, having come north^with his
brother to a
circuit,—readers
will have, we think, no~diffi-
culty in coming to the conclusion that
this figure denotes
the Prior.
His son was first Earl of Bothwell,~of'~EEe~[rne
of Stuart, and
his, the Earl's grandson,
Charles, came
to
such
a low
degree
as
to be
a common
trooper, and
is
introduced by Sir Walter Scott in one of the best known of
his
novels.
He
is
said
to have been killed
at Bothwell
Bridge.
The
figure
of a cherub,
which may have been
in
the
Monastery, and was fished out of the
river some years ago
in the
Castle
Shot, some time at Campfield, is in fair pre-
servation.

ALEXANDER THE SECOND'S REIGN
:
1214-1249.
SUPPLEMENTARy.
Communications from Provost Phineas Mackintosh and
Provost William Inglis of Inverness, to Captain, afterwards
General Hutton, regarding the monastery at Inverness, and
other
ecclesiastical remains, written
towards the
close of
last centmy , having recently been discovered in the Advocates'
Library, we have thought it right
to print Provost
Inglis*
letters.
The
letters were doubtless framed by the Town
Clerk,
because, though there is a difference in dates of six years,
the later communication by Provost Inglis, while it embodies
the whole of the first, adds to it.
We believe both Provosts
were wrong in supposing that the site of the High Church
had the former building dedicated to St Michael, as
it is
generally believed that
the parish
church dedicated to St
Mary stood
there.
Some other statements
also
must be
received with caution.
A resident in Inverness,
the late Mr James
Suter, jun.,
well entitled
to write on such
points, kindly made some
observations upon our seventh
article
:— 1. What
is now
styled the Friars' Shot is called three hundred years ago the
" Freschott," and
this word
signifies
that part of a river
which
is
affected by the
tide, sometimes
fresh, sometimes
salt water.
2. What is now termed the
'^ Cherry Shot"
is
derived from the
Gaelic word " Curach," a small boat, it
being at this place that boats were in use to land
; and the
term " Cherry Dyke" signified the bank whereon these small
boats were beached.
3. Further down the river than the
" Cherry Flat" was the
^^ Ship Flat," where larger vessels
used
to
lie
before
the
introduction of
piers.
The name
" Shipland" still prevails, and the ancient mansion house of
the family of Alves, Lairds of Shipland, with its fine garden,
is yet in fair preservation.
It is also stated that the Gaelic
of Ship
Flat
is
denoted by
the word now corrupted into
" Longman."
The words ^' Longman's Grave" have been a
frequent
puzzle.
4.
Beyond
the
Ship
Flat
was
the
" Scathegate," or Herring Bay, extending to Fortrose Point.
The Road to the sea by Rose JStreet was of old a well-known
locality— the " Scategate Road."
The enormous quantity

20
INVERNESSIANA.
of herring taken
in former
ages
is narrated by Boece
in
these terms
:
In the mouth of the Nesse standeth a town called Invemesse, where sometime
was great abundance
of
hei'ring taken, but now they
be gone, by the secret
working of God.
The common i^eople put the fault in the rich and men of
higher
calling, who envying the commodity of the poor inhabitants, will often
seem to bereave them of
this emolument by force and slaughter, whereupon
(as they say) it cometh to pass that the increase soon decayeth, and very small
store is taken there by many years after such injury offered.
As we are quoting
Boece, we may give another extract
regarding the neighbouring parish of Petty
:
In this j)ortion furthermore is the church of Pette, where the bones of little
Johne remain in great estimation.
Certes his carcasse hath been fourteen feet
long, his members well proportioned according to his stature, and not fully six
years before this book was written, he saw his haunch bone, which seemed so
great as the whole thigh of a man, and he did thrust his arme into the hollowness
thereof, whereby it appeareth that mighty people grew up in our region before
they were overcome with gluttony and excess.
Small herring used to be taken in great numbers by the
Clachnaharry
fishers
not
far
from
the
shore,
and
their
occupation, though well nigh gone for many years, has of late
rather revived.
Follows the communications from Provost Inglis
:
The Monastery at Inverness was situated in a fine plain on the east side of
the
river.
There remains of it now only one pillar, from the great size of which,
the building must have been extensive, or the architecture very disproportionate.
The ground which
it covered
is now used as a burying-place by a few families
in the jiarish, of the names of Baillie and Maclean, who, with their connexions,
seem to have acquired an exclusive right to it.
They have lately enclosed
it
with a good stone wall.
There is no monument in it which has the appearance
of great antiquity, excej)t the figure of a woman
(?) larger than the life, rudely
cut in stone, and much mutilated.
This Monastery has been always called by
the inhabitants " The Grey Friars," although the only one of which we have an
account in history was that founded by King Alexander the Second, anno. 1233,
said to have been of the Dominican Order.
Adjoining to the Monastery there
is a very rich
field of about six acres, which was always the Glebe of the first
minister of Inverness,
There are also a number of small houses in the lane
leading to it, from which the minister receives a feu or ground rent.
The salmon-fishing directly opposite to the Friary, and esteemed the most
valuable in the river, did also belong to it, and
is to this day called the Friar's
Coble or Shot.
It appears by the town's records that the stones of the Friars' Kirk were sold
in the year 1653 to Colonel Lilburn, commanding the troops of the Common-
wealth, for building a Fort at the river mouth, which was called Oliver's Fort.
On a rising ground, separated from the Monastery by the lane only, stood the
Parish Church, a very ancient structure, which having become quite ruinous,
was pulled down in the year 1769, and the present church built on its site.
On
the west side of the river opposite to the Friary, stood the chapel of the green,
supposed to belong to it.
The lands contiguous to the chapel were church lands,
and now hold feu of the town.
East of the Monastery, and only separated from
it by the street, stood St Mary's Chapel, of which no vestige remains.
It was
situated
in the centre of
a square
field about four acres in extent—now the
principal burying-ground of the town, and still called the Chapel-yard.
Adjacent
to
it
is the Glebe for the second minister.
South-east of this Glebe was St
Thomase's Chapel, of which there remains nothing.
The tradition is, that when the fort was built out of the ruins of the Monastery,
the stones of this Chapel were ap^Dlied towards building what is called the Old
Harbour,
in which many stones
curiously
carved, and which have evidently
been in some other building, are yet to be seen.
The lands of the Chaplainry of
our Lady's High Altar are situated on a rising ground south of St Thomas's



INVERNESSIANA.
21
Chapel, and near to the side of MacBeth's Castle, and Saint John's Chapel stood
in a field below the old Castlehill.
No vestige of the Chapel remains, but the
field
is to this day called Dire na Pouchk, or the Land of the Poor, and
is in
possession of the Church Session.
There was also a Chapel dedicated to Saint
Catherine on the west side of the river Ness, but no trace of
it, or any of the
others remains, nor would
their situations have been remembered, but that in
some old charters, the lands are described by the directions in which they lye
to the Chapels.
There were several religious houses of inferior note in the town
:—St Michael's
Manse, situated in the East Gate or East Street
; St Peter's Manse, in the street
called Kirk Gate, near the Friary.
There are some hovxses in town which have
in their Keddendos the payment of a small sum to Saint John and his successors,
and on one house there is an
ii'on
cross, such as the houses which belonged to
the Knights Templars are said to have been distinguished by.
I cannot learn
that there is even a tradition of a Nunnery having been here, nor can I discover
that there was any hospital ]irevious to the reign of Queen Mary.
The lauds, fishings, &c., belonging to the Friars were granted to the town of
Inverness by Queen Mary, and the grant confirmed by her son, James the Sixth.
Of each
of these
charters
copies may be had, if thought worth the trouble.
Impressions of the seal of the town are delivered herewith.
Mt Deae
Sir,—I
send you enclosed
the best
account
I
can
give
of
the
Monasteiy which existed in the town, and which
I believe to have been of the
Franciscan Order and not the Dominican.
At any rate, it is certain we had one
of the former order, and although history mentions the establishment of one of the
latter by Alexander the Second, yet have we no trace of it in any of our records,
nor any tradition respecting
it.
You know the spot where the shaft of
the
pillar still remains has been invariably called the Grey Friars, and in the Act of
the Town Council which mentions the sale to Colonel Lilburn, it
is expressly
called the Grey Friars' Kirk.
The price paid to the town for the stones of that
kii'k was
.
.
.
Both these orders of Friars you know were
bi'ought
into
Scotland in the reign of the second Alexander by William Malvoisin, Bishop of
St Andrews
; the Dominicans or Black Friars in the 1230, and the Franciscans
or Grey in following year.
Now,
as the historians
of these times
were
not
always accurate in
their statements, and as these two orders were introduced
into the kingdom nearly together, is it not i>robable that Black has by mistake
been inserted for Grey ?
I remember an old arched gateway which led into the buryingground
called
the Chai)el Yard, and which you know
is separated from the site of the Friars'
Kirk only by the street.
On this old arch was inscribed " Concordia res parvae
crescunt."
Now, if this was the motto of either of these Orders, it would clear
the matter up pretty much, for
if
it was the motto of the Black Friars, then
they i^robably had a convent here, and that place which we call the Chapel Yard
was the site of
it.
If, on the contrary, that was the motto of the Franciscans,
then a chapel belonging to them must have stood there.
I have written to my friend, the minister of Chanonry or Fortrose, for an
account of the Cathedral of that place—a venerable pile—and for coj^ies of seals
and any other curiosities he can furnish, and I know I shall soon hear from him
with all the information he can give.
I expect that the papers belonging to the
town, which are in Mr Charles Mackintosh's hands, will soon be returned to us,
and
if
they
arrive
before your
departure,
they
shall be
su^bmitted
to your
inspection.—I am, my dear sir, yours most sincerely,
(Signed)
Will.

THE CHURCH IN INVERNESS IN THE REIGNS OF
WILLIAM THE LION AND ALEXANDER THE SECOND.
PART FOURTH.
THE PARISH OF BONA.
Mr Buckle has been found much
fault with for under-
rating the so-styled universality of popular feeling in favour
of
the
Reformation,
and
accounting
for
the movement
rather to the cupidity of the nobility and gentry.
That the
latter was the mainspring, aided no doubt by the corruption
of the Romish clergy, cannot be doubted.
The reforming
clergy, expecting
to share
in
at least part of the Church
endowments, were wofully disappointed
; and not until the
reign of Charles I. had they any certain
stipends.
During
the reigns of Mary and James VI.
the Church patrimony
was donated to the laity in the most profuse manner
; and
from lack of supply, great numbers of coterminous parishes
were annexed and incorporated with one another—all to the
benefit of the heritors.
It is only within the present cen-
tury that a counter movement has
set
in, whereby many
churches quoad sacra have been
beneficially formed within
the Church.
These observations are not out of place in introducing the
parish of Bona, which has been united with Inverness since
1618, and never had much of an ecclesiastical
status since
the Reformation.
As now spelt, the pureness of its Latinity
has served to procure for Bona a Roman origin.
The very
oldest writing extant relative to it (after quoted) in the year
1233 gives the name
'' Baneth"
; the common spelling three
and four hundred years ago was " Bonnoche" and '^ Banache,"
and about a hundred
years ago
'' Bonath."
The Gaelic
definition is supposed to be " The white plain or field."
In
a petition presented by the ministers of Inverness last cen-
tury for the
erection of manses, they founded upon there
being two parishes
as one reason why each minister was
entitled to a manse.
With regard to the parish of Bona, so
much ignorance appears to have prevailed that they could
not condescend upon
its bounds, but merely that it was of
considerable
extent.
Fortunately, the
limits of the parish
can be designated from an
old deed granted
in favour of
John Maclean of Dochgarroch, in the year 1643, by Thomas
Fraser of Strichen.
It proceeds upon the narrative of a right

INVERNESSIANA.
23
acquired to the teinds of the whole parish of Bona by Strichen's
father, Thomas
Eraser, and his mother,
Isobel
Forbes,
in
1584, from Thomas
Innes, who was both parson and vicar
of Bona.
From
this
deed
the
limits
of Bona
are
well
defined, and extended from
Abriachan
at
the south-west
adjoining
Urquhart,
to
Dochgarroch
at
the
north-east
adjoining Inverness; thus including Lord
Seafield's lands
of Abriachan and Caiploch, Dunain's lands of Dochnacraig
or Lochend, the lands of Dochfour, and the lands of Doch-
garroch.
The Church of Bona may have been
at Abriachan, and
the place
is
still known
as
Gill
Fhianan.
The
present
burying-ground is called Claodh
Uradain, the burial-place of
Uradan, or Curidan, and this would infer that
there never
was
a church
there.
There was
a meeting-house
in
the
immediate vicinage, and there has been
for some years a
neat Free Church.
The name of Uradain, which
is
also
found in Corrimony, is synonymous with the Latin Quire-
tinus and the English Boniface, and is the same
saint who
is patron of Rosemarkie.
Bona also possesses a great stone
—the seat of Uradain—on the top of the ridge where the
saint used to rest, when crossing to the Caiploch to preach,
" The hollow of Ossian*,"
'' The grave of Bran," and " The
burn of Tuarie," supposed to be a Fingalian.
The parish and church of Bona must have been gifted at
an early period, as thei'e is no
trace of it in the chartulary
of Moray,
and,
indeed,
its
history
is almost
a blank.
It
appears to have been granted, with numerous other posses-
sions,
in the year
1592 by James
YI.
to
the
first Lord
Spynie, but not by
name.
In the year 1621, Alexander,
Lord
Spynie,
is
served
heir
in
special
to
his
father,
in
inter alia the right of patronage of Bona, and in the same
year. Bona
is
expressly
granted by
King James
to
his
Lordship.
Shaw states that in 1623, Lord Spynie disponed
his rights to Eraser of Strichen
; but it appears
that as late
as 12th June 1646, George, Lord Spynie, was served heir in
special to his father in the church of Bona.
On
the other
hand, it is evident that from the year 1584 the Erasers of
Strichen had some
interest
in
it, and in
1657,
Thomas
Eraser, then of Strichen, had the undoubted right.
In the
locality of 1756, Dochgarroch's right to his teinds was con-
tested, and his agent, Mr James Eraser, writing from Edin-
burgh, under date 4th February 1766, thus
refers
to Lord
* A very aged man, named Ferguson, who lived in thi3 hollow or glaick, and
died in spring 1867, was all his days commonly called " Ossian."

24
TNVERNESSIANA.
Striclien,—" Strichen was genteel enough to furnish all the
materials he could
direct
to."
The patronage came after-
wards by purchase
into
the family of Lovat, was
forfeited
in 1746, and again
restored.
General Fraser had a mind
to bestow the right of patronage on
the town of Inverness,
which
it
is a pity was not
effected.
It might have been
very
well
at
one
time, when
the
Lovats
were
principal
heritors in the united parish, that the right stood in them,
but, as they have now no land, this
privilege is
to say the
least anomalous.
In the year 1567, William Simpson, Reader at Bonach,
receives a salary of £20
Scots, due
at Candlemas of that
year.
The Barony of Bona is frequently alluded to on record, as
it was often in the King's hands by forfeitures and other-
wise.
Some notices of it will be taken in due order.
We
conclude the present notice by introducing the name of Elias,
Vicar of Bona, witness to an agreement betwixt the Chapter
of Moray and
Sir
Allan Durward
(Hostiarius), regarding
lands in
the
adjoining parish of Urquhart in 1233.
The
church
at " Aberihacyn"
is described
in the chartulary of
Moray
as
one
of
the common
churches
of
the
chapter.
Follows the agreement
(coinjyositio) regarding the lands of
the church of IJrquhart
:
Andrevv^, by the grace of God, Bishop of Moray, to all who shall see or hear
these i^resents. Greeting in the Lord Eternal
: Know all that by our mediation
an amicable settlement has been come to in the question which arose between
our chapter on the one part, and that noble person, Sir Allan Durward, on the
other i^art
; touching a half davoch of land which the said chapter maintained
to belong to the Church of Urquhart, which is a part of the i^rebend pertaining
to the Chancellorshii) of the Church of the Holy Trinity at Elgin,
The arrange-
ment
is as follows
:—The said chapter, and William at that time Chancellor of
the said Church of the Holy Trinity, demanded from the said noble man, Sir
Allan Durward, that he should yield his claim and the whole right which he
said he had to the said land.
And now the said Allan, for the sake of j)eace,
has given to the Church of Urquhart half the land sought, viz. , the half of the
half davoch—which
is called the half davoch of the church
foresaid—in pure,
free, and perpetual elimosina.
But he and his heirs will possess the other half
of the half davoch in ):)erpetual feu farm.
Giving therefor yearly to the Church
at Urquhart ten shillings, viz. , 5s at Pentecost, and 5s at the feast of St Martin
in winter next following.
But fui'ther, the said C]iu.rch of Urquhart will have
one plenary croft, and one toft of four acres assigned to the said church near it,
in a suitable and convenient place, in gift of the said noble person, in pure, free,
and perpetual elimosina.
And in firm and indubitable testimony of the i?remises,
to that part of this writing which shall remain with the said chapter,
is placed
the seal of the said noble man. Sir Allan Durward, and our own.
And to that
part which
shall remain with the often above-named noble man, is placed the
seal of our chapter and our own.

THE CHURCH IN INVERNESS IN THE REIGNS OF
WILLIAM THE LION AND ALEXANDER THE SECOND.
PART FIFTH.
KINMYLIES, 1232.
In these reigns, the Bishops of Moray were very active in
enlarging their revenues, and one of the most important of
the many grants in their favour was the charter of Kinmy-
lies
in 1232.
No bounds
are given
in the charter, but
in
the rental of the Bishoprick in 1565
;
the barony of Kin-
mylies comprehended Achmounie, in Grlen-Urquhart, feued
to Duncan Mac-Gillies
;
Easter Kinmylies, Wester Kinmy-
lies, Ballifeary, Easter Obriachan, Wester Obriachan, Kil-
whimmen, the
Mill
of Bught,
the fishings of Ness
called
Freschot,
Moniack,
Kiltarlity, with
the
fishings of Ess,
feued to Lord Lovat
; Boleskine and Foyers, held in feu by
the heirs of William Eraser ; the lands of Diirris, the tene-
ment
of Helen
Flemyng within
the burgh of Inverness,
possessed by Peter Winchester
; and the tenement of Robert
Waus, possessed by Jasper Waus.
This
fine property would appear
to have been possessed
prior
to the date of the grant by several Kings' tenants or
Thanes, to whom several references are made.
Reference is
also made to the King's milns, which existed
at that early
period.
These milns were afterwards granted
to the town,
and were so valuable that they were subdivided
into
five
estates, a mode
of
title we
believe
still
kept
up.
In a
similar manner the original grant of fishings to the town
from Clachnahalig to the sea, or four cobles—was subdivided
into eight half
cobles—the present
state
of possession —
whereof the town now possesses but one half coble.
In
respect of this subject, the public has the privilege of a free
day's fishing every eighth day during the season.
It is known that there was a church and burying ground
at Kinmylies, formerly Kilmylies, and
it may have been
dedicated
to the Virgin Mary, or a female
saint, Maillie or
Marion.
It would appear that some instruction and educa-
tion were given at the place from the word made use of by
the King in describing the lands
" j^rejjositiire.''
This word,
according to the best authorities, signified collegiate church.
The favour of the early Scottish Kings
to their burghs,
and particularly to Inverness,
is seen
in this charter, where
D

26
INVERNESSIANA.
their privileges of pasture are reserved, and it will be observed
that Alexander
also
reserves
the lands
of Merkinch, the
grant whereof shall be given in our next.
It may be instructive
to contrast
the reddendo
of
this
charter, with the present holding of the subjects.
The main
portion of Kinmylies proper now belongs to Evan Baillie of
Dochfour, and
at the end
of
this paper
will be found a
translation
of
his
obligations,
from
the
Crown
charter.
There is among other burdens a stipulation to keep in repair
the
choir of the parish church.
When the High Church
comes to be rebuilt,
it might be well to have a choir, seeing
that there is surplus teind from Kinmylies.
The ministers of the first charge have frequently mooted
the question of their being entitled
to have a grass glebe,
but it has hitherto never ended in any
decisive step.
The
grass glebe would fall to be designated primarily out of church
lands,
of which the old barony of Kinmylies
is the most
important.
The town of Inverness
is running a risk by
continuing to uplift the seat rents of the High Church, and
acting and behaving as
if they were owners
; and
further,
are running another risk by non-payment to the first minister
of the interest of the proceeds realised by them from the sale
of the ruinous manse, which
for many years past has not
been accounted
for.
At same time
it may be mentioned
that the town continues
to pay a sum for stipend in name
of " common good," undertaken under circumstances which
do not now exist.
Follows King Alexander's grant of Kin-
mylies
:
Alexander, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to
all good men of
all his
land, cleric and laic
; greeting
: Know
all present and to come that we have
given and by this our charter confirmed to Andrew, Bishop of Moray, and his
successors, Bishops of Moray, the whole land of our collegiate Church of Kin-
myly (totam terrain prepositure nostre de Kinmyly) in feu for ever
; to be held
by the said Bishop and his successors. Bishops of Moray, by their pro^jer bound-
aries, and with all their just pertinents, excepting the lands of Merkinch, which
we have granted to our burgesses of Inverness
; and excepting all the tofts and
lands, which have been given upon the day of this grant to bax'ons, knights, or
other good men of our land, within the boundaries of the
foresaid Collegiate
Church of Kinmylies
; and excepting all our
fishings, except one, which on the
day of this grant, was let for half a merk, which fishings the farmers or thaynes
of our said collegiate church were wont to have.
So, however, that our burgesses
of Inverness, and people dwelling in the tofts and lands of our barons, knights,
and other good men, who are feuars within the boundaries of the foresaid
col-
legiate church of Kinmylies, may have the privilege of pasture, which they were
wont to have within the bounds of the said collegiate church—giving, therefor,
to us and our heirs, ten pounds yearly, half at Pentecost, and half at the feast
of St Martin, in winter, and doing foreign, or out service, in the auxiliary forces
and armies, and other services, which j)ertain to the foresaid land of ELinmylies,
except those which belong to the thayne.
(Et faciendo fornisecum servitium in
auxiliis et aliis que ad predictam terrain de Kinmyly pertinent preter ea que at
Thaynnm pertinent. )
Wherefore, we will that the foresaid Andrew, Bishop of
Moray, and his successors, Bishops of Moray, hold the said land of the collegiate
church of Kinmylies for ever, freely and quietly as aforesaid, reserving to us all
l)leaa and questions, which can spring from the said land of the collegiate church

of Kinmylies, or the inhabitants of the same, except those which pertain to the
tbanage.
Further, the inhabiters
of the said hind of the collegiate church of
Kinmylies may frequent our mill at Inverness
;
but the Bishop himself, and his
successors, Bishops of Moray, shall be free from jiaying dues to our mill from
their own house at Kinmylies.
Further,
it shall be lawfid to the said Bishops
of Moray to grind the corn which they use in their own house of Kinmylies in
another mill if they chose.
Furthei-, we grant to the said Bishop, and his suc-
cessors, Bishops of Moray, that from the foresaid ten pounds they retain in their
own hands every year four merks for the tithes which pertain to them from the
mill at Elgin
; and ten
shillings, which
pertains to them from
the lands
of
IMunden and
Kelleys, and
sixteen
shillings, which pertain to them from the
tithes of the mills of Delpottie, and twenty shillings, which pertain to them
from the lands of Lovat, which belong to John Byseth, and twenty-two shillings
and eightpence, which pertain to the Archdeacon of Moray for tithes of the mills
built Avithin the parish of Forres, from which twenty-two
shillings and eight
pence to the Lord Archdeacon of Moray the said Bishops of Moray have relieved
us.

Follows reddendo clause in the present crown charter of
Kinmylies, dated in 1836
:
Giving therefor,—for the foresaid lands of Easter and Wester Kinmylies,
dominical lands, crofts, and pertinents of the same, the sum of twenty pounds
Scots money of old feu duty, and three shillings and four pence of the foresaid
money as an augmentation
; and that at two terms in the year—the feasts of

feu-duty and augmentation the first year of the entry of each
heir, and giving
suit and presence at three Head Courts, held at Spynie, and performing the
other services and conditions contained in the ancient infeftments.
And for the
foresaid lands of Balblair, Ballifeary, and Dalneach, crofts and pertinents of the
same, also j)arts of the said barony of Kinmylies, the sum of £18 15s 7d Scots
money, as the proportion corresponding to the lands and others above-mentioned
of the whole feu-duty of £40 Scots money, payable for the said lands of Balblair,
Ballifeary, Dalneich, crofts and pertinents, for the same, and for the lands of
Muirtown, the Mill of Bught, and pertinents of the same, also parts of the said
barony of Kinmylies, now pertaining to Huntly Duff of Muirtown, and that at
two terms in the year—the feasts of Pentecost and St Martin in winter, by equal
portions, and in the first year of the entry of each heir to the said lands doubling
the said proportion of feu-duty as use is, and performing other services and con-
ditions contained in the ancient infeftments.
And for the foresaid tithes, par-
sonage and vicarage, of the foresaid lands of Easter and Wester Kinmylies and
Ballifeary, and the pertinents of the same, the sum of one
shilling sterling as
the proportion corresponding to the same, determined by the Barons of Exche-
quer at the sum of £200 Scots, which is the whole feu-duty payable for the tithes
above-mentioned, and also for the lordship and barony of Aberbrothock, of which
they are parts, and that at two terms in the year— the feasts of Pentecost and
St Martin in winter, by equal portions, and a proportional part of the stipend
payable to the minister serving the cure of the Parish Church of Inverness, and
towards the lepairing of the choir of the said Parish Church, and all other taxes,
annuities, and other burdens laid or to be laid upon the tithes of the said parish.
XL
ALEXANDER THE SECOND'S REIGN, 1214-1249.
GRANT OF MERKINCH.
We read that Alexander had been at Inverness in the year
1219 or 1220, from a record of his proceedings
at Perth in

28
INVERNESSIANA.
the latter year.
It bears at the outset these words
:— ** The
Record made at St Johnston of Perth before the King, by-
all
the Dempsters of Scotland, Thursday, in the first
haill
week of Lentron, the seventh year of his Kynrik, after that
the King had been in hosting at Inverness, against Donald
Nelson" (of the Isles).
He was also in the North, according
to Lord Hailes, in the year 1222, in an expedition against
the Earl of Caithness, and the years 1228-29, when
one
Gillescop, besides disturbing the peace of the North, burnt
the town of Inverness, and spoiled the Crown
lands in the
neighbourhood.
Alexander came against him in person un-
successfully, but the next year the Earl of Buchan, Justicar
of Scotland, overthrew Gillescop, with his two sons.
It
is
related in the
Mackintosh
History
that
William
Mackintosh, brother of Farquhar, the third chief, was one of
Alexander's retainers, and accompanied the King when he
went to renew the league with Philip YII. of France.
In the year 1464, James III. ratified at Inverness, to the
burgh, all the Acts and
Charters granted by prior Kings,
viz., William, Alexander, David, and James the First.
When
James HI. came
to Alexander, he says " The tenor of the
charter by our most serene predecessor, Alexander, King of
Scots,
follows
in
this form," and after quoting
it,
King-
James adds, " The tenor of the second charter of the said
King Alexander, follows in this form."
It will be observed
that it is not stated which Alexander, second
or
third, but^
it is said that both charters are by the same King.
The curious circumstance has just been elicited that these
charters are by different Kings, and that James III.'s advisers
committed a blunder in
attributing them
to one monarch.
It is needless to narrate the circumstances under which this
discovery has been made.
Suffice
to say
that,
started by
ourselves, it has been tested and confirmed by high authority.
Singularly, also, the second
charter of Alexander, narrated]
by James III., is first in date, having been granted in 1236
by Alexander the Second in the 22d year of his reign.
The
other charter by Alexander the Third was granted in 1250,
in the second year of his
reign.
Alexander the Second's
charter, after quoted, grants
the lands of Merkinch
to the
town, but on reference
to the charter of Kinmylies in our
last, dated 1232, it will be observed that the lands of Merk-
inch were excluded
as having been granted
to the burgh.
This difficulty between dates can be explained in this way,
that in 1232 Alexander had given the corporeal possession
of the land to the burgh, though the charter was not actually
written until 1236
; when the King being then in Inverness,!

XII.
ALEXANDER THE THIRD, 1249-1285.
During the reign of Alexander the Third, which lasted
for thirty-six years, Scotland upon the whole enjoyed great
prosperity.
The population has been stated to have numbered

30
INVERNESSIA.NA.
close on two millions, and
the records were numerous and
regular.
Loss of men, wealth, and muniments, to an incon-
ceivable degree, followed the protracted
struggle with Eng-
land, from
the death of Margaret of Scotland to the
final
establishment of Robert Bruce on the throne.
At an early period, Alexander granted a charter to Inver-
ness, of which a copy
will be found
at the
end.
That he
visited
the town
is shown by a charter granted by him
to
the
Bishop
of Aberdeen,
dated
Inverness, 10th August,
1260.
It was during the first year of his reign, and at the
close of Alexander the
Second's,
that the great ship was
built
at Inverness
for the purpose of carrying
soldiers
to
the Holy Land by that powerful French nobleman, com-
monly called the Count de
St Paul.
The circumstance is
alluded
to
in the following terms by the historian
Paris,
when
regretfully
chronicling
the death
of
several
of the
French nobles, who were preparing in 1249 to assist in the
crusade
:
There also died on the journey at Avignon, Hugh de Chatelion, Count of St
Paul and Blois, who was killed by a stone hurled from a mangonelle at Avignon,
in the contest which the King was engaged in with the citizens of that place,
before he set sail—a sad presage of the prosecution of the crusade, for there was
not in the whole French army a more noble man, or one more powerful in battle.
He had in his retinue 50 chosen knights, as his standard-bearers in battle, but
when he died
all of them were disj^ersed and left desolate.
This Count Hugh
had built a handsome ship
at Inverness, in the country of Moray, and in the
Kingdom
of
Scotland,
in which he might be able to cross the
sea with the
Bolognese and Flemings, and those commonly called men of Arlterre
; but all
these preparations were cut short before completion, as a weaver cuts his web.
In this King's reign, a valuation of the whole of Scotland
was taken by Royal
order, which was known as the valua-
tion " of old extent."
Fordun states that so numerous and
powerful were the family of Comyn at this period, that there
were no fewer than thirty-two Knights of the name.
In 1263 Alexander visited the north and came the length
of Caithness.
By the Chamberlain's accounts, a new fence
or palisade was erected around the Castle
at an expense of
£1
18s
9d, and
inside was constructed a wardrobe-room,
with
a double wooden
roof,
at
a
cost
of £7
19s.
The
salary of the chaplain who
ofiiciated in the chapel of the
Castle was five merks yearly.
In the same year, Lawrence de
Grant
was
Sherifi"
of
Inverness.
Tho' the name appears
earlier in history, yet it
is from
this Lawrence, who married the
heiress of Glen-
charnich, whose posterity still retain the lands, the family
of Grant date their real establishment in the north.
Follows King Alexander the Third's Charter to the town
of Inverness
:

^
INVERNESSIANA.
31
Alexander, by the grace of God, King of Scots.
To all good men of his whole
realm.
Greeting
: Know ye that we have granted to our Burgesses of Inverness,
that none of them shall be poinded in our Kingdom for any but his own proper
debt, forfeit, or pledge.
Moreover, we command and charge our Sheriffs and
Bailies,
constituted on
the
northern
side of Delmoneth* and
all others,
or
their Bailies, to poind those who owed debts to our Burgesses, which they could
reasonably prove, for i-endering payment of such debts as may be justly due to
them without delay
; nevertheless, we strictly forbid them to presume to detain
or oppress any one unjustly with poindings for debts which he owes them, con-
trary to the foresaid grant
wliich we have made to them upon our
plenary
forfeiture.

ALEXANDER III
1249-1285. PART SECOND.
CHURCH
AND LANDS OF ABRIACHAN.
The lands
of Abriachan must have been granted
to the
Bishoprick of Moray at a very
early period, perhaps at
its
foundation.
They formed a part of the parish of Bona, now
united with Inverness, and are the southernmost portion of
the parish.
There are no remains
of the church, but the
locality is
indicated by the name of Cill-Fhianan.
There
are some old grave stones, one of which
is
sculptured, and
evidently of great antiquity.
Numerous traditions regard-
ing
this
stone prevail
in
the
primitive
district, and
it
is
matter
of
regret
that
the
immediate
locality,
which
is
picturesquely situated, is not tended and enclosed.
Abriachan
has
of
late come
into
repute from
its
red
granite, which is susceptible of the finest polish.
Besides an inveterate fondness for distillation, independent
of Government control, there were some peculiarities in the
appearance and habits of the Abriachan men, which did not
escape the notice
ol' their neighbours.
A Gaelic rhymer,
who perchance had been silenced in an alehouse wrangle,
1
•
* That is, of the Month, <w Mounth.
The Grampian hills were so named in
early times, and the terra Cairn of Mounth also sometimes occurs.
An anony-
mous author cited by Camden thus describes these
hills
:—"Mons, qui Mounth
vocatur qui a mari occidentali usque ad orientale extenditur ;" and another in
the 13th century writes thus:—" Quoddam vastum quod vocatur
le Mounth,
ubi est pessimum passaglum sine cibo."

32
INVERNESSIANA.
gave vent
to
his
feelings in a famous rhyme, which may
thus be clothed in an English dress
:
Abriachan rears but little men,
Addicted much to liquors strong ;
They'd speak for ever ; as to sense,
They only gabble all day long.
The Church lands
of
Abriachan, though
part
of Bona
parish, did not form part of the barony of Bona, as will be
seen by
the
deed
after
quoted, which
describes them
as
lying betwixt
the barony of Bona
at
the
north and
the
barony of Urquhart at the south.
It
is also probable that
the present bounds of Abriachan are not identical with their
former positions, because the estate of Dunain, comprehend-
ing Lochend or Davochnacraig, has a right of salmon fishing
in Loch Ness, ex adverso of the lands of Abriachan, to a rock
called the Black
Stone.
The old writings refer
also to the
barony of " Benquhar," a name
still known by the Gaelic
speaking people, and
is described
to us
as extending from
Balnagaick of Dunain, to the Red Burn of Dochnacraig.
The name of Abriachan under the spelling of *' Abirihacyn"
is first found in the year
1239, though
'•^ Urquhart beyond
Inverness,"
and
^^ Gillebride,
parson
of
Abertarff,"
its
neighbours, are met with
several years earlier
in the great
Charter of Bricius, Bishop of Moray, 1208-1215.
Andrew,
Bishop of Moray, on the 31st December 1239 grants inter alia
^' from a divine
regard
for
piety and
for
the
increase of
divine worship, with consent of his clergy, to the Church of
the Holy Trinity of Elgin, and
to the Canons
serving, and
who may in future serve God
there, in pure and perpetual
charity, for the common use of said Canons," under certain
reservations therein
particularly
specified, " the church of
Abirihacyn,
with
all
its
pertinents,
excepting
one
half
davoch of
land,
belonging
to
our
table and that
of our
successors."
In the Taxaciones heneiiciorum Ejnscopatus Mora-
viensis, the church of Abriachan is only valued at two merks,
but probably this included vicarages merely.
We find the lands—which extended
to a half davcch
granted by John, Bishop of Moray, to Sir Robert Lauder of
Quarrelwood, by the deed after
quotec}, on the
feast of St
Nicholas (6th December) 1334.
Agaii, on the 3d February
1376, on the resignation of Sir Robert de Chisholm, son of
Sir John de Chisholm, who had married Anne, daughter of
Sir Robert Lauder, Alexander, Bishop of Moray, disposes
the lands by the deed,
also
after quoted,
to
the Wolf of
Badenoch.

At a later period, the lands of Abriachan formed
in the
Episcopal rentals, a part of the Barony of Kinmylies, and
were finally feued out by the Bishop and Chapter to Hugh,
Lord Lovat, on 13th May 1544; and
are in the charter de-
scribed as the lands of Easter and Wester Abriachan, lying
within the Barony
of Kinmylies and Regality of Spynie,
Afterwards the lands came into possession of the family of
Grant, who wadsetted them
to the Erasers of Reelig, who
again assigned the right to Evan
Baillie, a younger son of
Alexander
Baillie, second of
Dochfour.
From
the repre-
sentatives of this Evan
Baillie,
styled Evan
l)hu, a well-
known lawyer in Inverness upwards of a century ago and a
great
ally and doer of Simon, Lord Lovat's
;—the
late Sir
James Grant of Grant redeemed the wadset, and the lands
of Abriachan are the only lands belonging to the Grants
in
the united parish of Inverness and Bona.
ALEXANDER III-1249-1285. PART THIRD,
SERVICE TO LAND IN THIS REIGN, HELD AT
INVERNESS.
In this reign
the commerce of Inverness was extensive,
•«/ and its annual fairs were attended by foreign merchants.
The
following connected with the town and the north, are extracts
from the accounts of the Sheriff of Inverness in 1263
:
Received of feus of many lands, &c., £133 13s 4d.
Item, to John de Walcliop, by gift of the Lord the King, 6 merks.
Item, for the expenses of 21 hostages or captives (obsidum) from Caithness, a
penny per day for each
; and for 2 from Scy (Skye), |d per day to each, with
the expenses of theii keepers, £30 13s 4d.
Received of the same (Alexander de Cumyn, Earl of Buchan)
for the fines
obtained in the town of Inverness, £95.
Memorandum, that it be enquired into whether Alexander Cuming, Earl of
Buchan, or Lawrence le Graunt,
Sheriff
of Inverness, ought to answer to the
Lord the King for the feu of the land of Inuery at the term of Pentecost (Whit-
sunday) in the year 1263.
Item, for 200 head of cattle from the land of the men of Caithness
58s, with
^
all expenses.
Item, for 20 lasts of herrings bought
for the use of
the Lord the King the
same year, 20 merks.
Item, for the carriage of said herrings by ship to Leith with the expenses of
guarding and carriage to the sea, 107s 3d.
Item, to the Sheriff for his captions in the burgh of Inverness for that year,
100 shillings.
With the deplorable loss of our early records, it is fortunate
that a service in the year 1262 has been preserved, and which

is hereafter quoted, in consequence of its having taken place
at Inverness, upon the day of the month next before the
feast of St Andrew the Apostle (29th November)
:

[Sallescot], Macbeth de Dych, Hugh Ranald, William son
of Turpun, Michael
son of Abraham, William de Brennath [Birnie], John de Oggiston [Gordonstown],
Gilpatrich Mac Gilbeg and John Faber de Ineys, regarding the land of Mefth
with the pertinents, to Avit, whether the ancestors of Eugenius Thane of Ratthen
[Eugenius, thane of Rathven and lord of Meft] have held the said land of our
Lord the King and his ancestors hereditarily, in chief, and if the said E. and his
heirs ought to hold
the said land of
our lord the king by right hereditarily
according to the tenor of the breve of the lord the king directed to the said
justiciar upon this matter.
All being sworn, say that Lord King William gave
the said land of Mefth with his house in the castle of Elgyn and with one net
upon the water of Spe and with the pertinents, to Yothre Mac Gilhys hereditarily
for the service of one serving man and for doing military service at home
; and
he held the said land with said pertinents throughout his whole life in the same
manner, and afterwards Eugenius his son grandfather of the foresaid Eugenius,
and Angus his son father of that Eugenius ; and that Eugenius similarly thus
far have held the foresaid land in the foresaid manner peacefully, hereditarily,
in chief of the Lord the King, and they know no reason why the said E. and his
heirs ought not to hold the said land otherwise than
of
the Lord the King
hereditarily by right.
The preceding is given not merely because the inquest was
held in Inverness.
It is interesting as showing the mode of
procedure in Scotland under the old form before the
loss of
the
national records and
the
introduction
of the English
practice
; and illustrative of the state of society and of the
country in those early times.
We fear that there is no one now to represent the Thane
of Rathven, but if there be any Gillies or Macgillies who can
connect himself with the Eugenius
referred
to, he
will be
able to substantiate a pedigree equal to that of any
subsist-
ing family, not excepting that of Innes, descendants of the
Flandrensian Berowald.
We have here Eugenius, of lawful
age in 1268, and mention made of Angus,
his
father,
of
Eugenius, his grandfather, and Yothre Macgilhys, his great-
grandfather.
As surnames
were
unknown, we may go a
step further back, and arrive at
Gillies
as
the great-great-
grandfather and founder, who may have lived in the year
1050,
if not
earlier, and his name has a good Celtic sound.
Mention also is made of a Macbeth of Dyke, no doubt a man
of consequence.
The lands of Meft were for a very long time the property
of the family of Innes.
They lie in the parish of Urquhart
and county of Elgin, and are now
the property of the Earl
of Fife, whose
predecessor
acquired them about the year
1760.
Their annual value appears to be £448 or thereby.

ALEXANDER III.
1249-1285. PART FOURTH,
THE ANNUAL OF NORWAY (RATIFIED AT INVERNESS),
FIRST SECTION.
The acquisition of the Western
Isles had long been an
object of importance to the Scottish kings^ and the disastrous
x/
results
to Norway of the battle of Largs paved the way for
a settlement, in pecuniary form.
Accordingly, on 2d July 1266, a composition or agreement
was come to, which included Man, copy of which is annexed^
and
is here introduced, not only
as a document of great
interest never hitherto printed in the English language, but
because it is in a measure closely connected with Inverness.
After Bruce was
settled
on
the
throne, he thought
it
desirable
to have
this agreement styled
" The Annual
of
Norway,"
ratified and confirmed by Haco V.
of Norway.
There met in consequence, at Inverness, representatives of
both kingdoms—King Robert being personally present—on
the Sunday next after the Feast of the Apostles Simon and
Jude, as will be seen by the deed
after quoted, which is of
so great length that it is divided into two sections.
Torfaeus, followed by Buchanan, states that it was
^^ farther
agreed that the King of Scotland's daughter Margaret, then
four years of age, should be married
to Haco son
to King
Magnus, when she arrived at a proper age."
But no such
stipulation
appears
in
the
contract.
On
the
contrary,
according to
Tytler, it was in consequence of the Queen's
death that Alexander
III.
" began to seek
alliances for his
children.
He married his daughter Margaret to Mnc, King
of Norway,
then a youth in
his fourteenth year."
Their
marriage contract is dated 25th July 1281.

PART FIFTH.
THE ANNUAL OF NORWAY (RATIFIED AT INVERNESS).
SECOND SECTION.
It was this agreement of 1266 which gave the Lordship of
the Isles
to the Scottish kings, but
as they had been pre-
viously granted in property to Somerled and his descendants,
it
is
questionable whether
for
a
considerable period
this
acquisition was not more troublesome than its worth.
Both monarchs it will be observed submitted themselves
to the jurisdiction of the Apostolic See.
Randolph
appears
as
Earl
of Moray
in
the month
of
October 1312, a date earlier than is generally supposed.
By the Chamberlain's rolls and the accounts of the Sheriff
of Inverness,
it appears
that the
latter
in 1263
disbursed
forty-seven
shillings and sevenpence " for the expenses of
the Preaching Friars (of Inverness) when going on the Lord
the King's message to Norway."
In the same year there is
charged for the expenses of the Chamberlain " while staying
at Inverness to feU the lands of the Lord the King,"
forty-
five shillings and fivepence.
The following entries are interesting
:
Item, to Kermac Macmaghan for 20 head of cattle from the territory of tho
.
Earl of Ross, given to him by the Earl of Buchan and Alan Hostiarius who hadj
the Lord
King's
authority by his
letters patent, at the time of the arrival oJ
the King of Norway, 100s.
Item, for the expenses of twenty one captives from Caithness, viz,, to each per]
day one penny, and for 25 weeks, and then they were set at liberty, £15 6s 3d.

Item, 4 merles deducted for the tenth of the Bishop of Moray, for the territory
of the wife of the late John Byset.

Shei-iff onght not to be called to account for £45
for the 29 head of cattle from the territory of the Earl of Ross which the Lord
King expected from
the
said
Earl,
until the Lord King shall have specially
commanded him to render an account.
Follows the remainder of the Annual of Norway
Moreover, Lord Magnus, King of Norway, by his ambassadors foresaid, and
Lord Alexander, King of Scotland, have submitted themselves, their heirs and
successors, in this matter,
to the jurisdiction of the Apostolic See, that
after
one admonition
has been given by
sentence
of excommu.nication against the
parties without any exception, and of interdict against the Kingdoms, it compel,
without legal quarrel and
trial of any kind,
the party
resiling from
foresaid.
Composition and final Agreement to pay to the party observing said Composition
and
final Agreement,
fully and completely, the said penalty of ten thousand
jnerks.
And further for observing the said Composition and final Agreement in
all and sundry
its articles which are not to be relaxed until said penalty, as
said
is,
shall have been fully paid, the said Composition and
final Agreement
shall endure in
its full strength and be of avail in and by
all ways for ever.
Accordingly,
both
parties have renounced
in
this
transaction
all
exception
because of fraud and all action because
of stratagem in
fact, and
privilege of
court, and specially restoration in full, and all letters had and obtained twixt the
said Kings and their ancestors up to this time, of whatever tenor they may be,
and all letters and apostolical indulgences that have been and may be obtained,
and all remedy of law, canonical and civil, by means of which said Composition,
resignation, quitclamation, and final Agreement can be impeded, disturbed,
or
destroyed, or in any other way weakened.
It has also been added to this Agree-
ment, and ordained by common
consent, twixt
the
Kings and Kingdoms of
Norway and
Scotland,
that
all
transgressions
and
offences
both
civil
and
religious which have been committed by either party, his ancestors and subjects,
upon the other, even up
to this present day,
are wholly
remitted,
and no
mode of hurt, anger, or vengeance
shall await for these
; And that the hostages
of said
islanders captured and detained by either party shall be freely set at
liberty and restored
; And if a private enemy of said Kings—to wit of Scotland
and Norway—flee for refuge to one of them he
shall not receive him into his
kingdom or dominion to the hurt of him from whom he has
fled, unless per-
chance at the time he obtain pardon, if he has deserved it, and if he shall not be
able to obtain the pardon of his offended lord, he
(the King) may not
delay
immediately after a
year
to remove
that person from
his
i^resence and
his
dominion, those being excepted who shall have committed the crime of
lese-
majesty, and they may
in nowise be received by either party.
Moreover, if
it ibappen that the subjects of the King of Norway, which God forbid, suffer
shipwreck or misfortune in the kingdom or dominion of the King of Scotland,
they shall be permitted freely and quietly to
collect their shattered or disabled
vessels together with all their property either personally or by means of others,
and to hold,
sell, and alienate the same without any chicanery, as long as they
shall not abandon them
; And if any one contrary to this Statute of the common
agreement shall take away fraudulently or violently anything of any kind from
said property or vessels, and for this be convicted as a thief and disturber of
the peace, he shall be punished according to his deserts, any law to the contrary
notwithstanding
; Also, if any one shall be found and convicted as a disturber
of the peace of this final Agreement passed and confirmed between the foresaid
Kings, their kingdoms and subjects, he
shall, because he has presumed to do so,
be so severely punished by the King in whose dominion he shall be found, that
his punishment may beget fear in others.

effect,
swore in a like manner on the soul of their Lord, the said Robert, King of Scot-

When it
is considered, that besides the King there were
present with him, at least four Bishops and three Earls
; and
for the King of Norway, one Archbishop, two Bishops, one
Earl, and two Barons,
it may be held that no other such
influential meeting ever took place at Inverness for a peace-
ful object.

MARGARET, MAIDEN OF NORWAY.
1286-1290.
At the time of Alexander the Third's death in 1286, there
was no living descendant of William the Lion in the direct
line, save Alexander's grandchild Margaret, then but
three

'eai-s old.
She was only child of Eric King of Norway, by
il^rgaret daughter of King Alexander,
Fordun
in
his
complaint
for
the
untimely
death
of
Alexander III. quotes the prophecy of Thomas the Rhymer
•egarding the sad
event, and introduces it
in the foUowing
|[uaint and dramatic manner
:
Do you not remember what that prophet, yoiir countryman, viz.
; Thomas
-of
Crsildon,
obscurely prophesying,
on the night preceding the death
of King
Llexander, in the Castle of Dunbar, had said of his death to the Earl of March,
?ho, as was his wont, enquired of him, as if by way of joke, what strange event
he following day would
disclose ?
Thomas
fetching from the bottom of
his
leart a sigh
full of sobbing,
is reported to have clearly revealed to the Earl in
iresence of his courtiers (what would haj)pen),
in this manner:—"Alas
!
to-
Qorrow
! day of calamity and misery
! for ere the twelfth hour is fully completed,
here will be heard throughout Scotland so violent a blast, that the like was not
:nGwn «f in times past.
Its breath shall astound the nations, amaze the hearers,
>ring down the lofty, and level to the ground the immoveable."
The Earl with
lis attendants was, because of this serious a,ddress, observant on the morrow,
Old kept watch eveu until noon, and perceiving no trace in the clouds of heaven,
lor signs of wind, thinking Thomas a madman they hurried
off to luncheon,
?here, while the Earl was scarcely seated at table, and the hand of the clock
ilmost approached the hour of mid-day, a messenger came in haste to the gate,
listurbed with imi^atient knocks the ears of the Earl and entreated to be allowed
,peedj entrance.
The stranger was accordingly admitted and asked
for
his
idings.
Tidings, said he, I have, but disastrous and to be deplored by the whole
iingdom
of
Scotland, since
alas, the renowned King reached the end
of his
jresent life, last night at Kinghorn, and I am come to tell thee this.
The Earl
it this recital, as if awakened from heavy sleep along with his comi^anions struck
;heir breasts, and found that the prophecies of Thomas were become more than
jrobable.
Shortly
after Alexander's
death, six guardians were ap-
pointed, whereof the three
for the
part benorth
the Forth
weve the Bishop of St Andrews, the
Earl of Fife, and
the
Earl of Buchan, who for a time conducted affairs successfully.
By and bye it was agreed, with the unanimous consent of
England, Scotland, and Norway, that Margaret the Maiden
should marry, when she attained the age of fifteen, the King
^{ England's son.
Edward attempted almost immediately
to
interfere
in
Scottish
affairs, but he had no reasonable
excuse for doing so.
Meantime Queen Margaret, who had never been strong,
was, on her journey to
Scotland, taken
ill, and landing in
Orkney, died theie in the month of September 1290, in the
eighth year of her age.
No provision having been made
for regulating the suc-
cession, the country was instantly divided
into factions, the
two
strongest
being
the
supporters
of Baliol and
Bruce.
The death of Margaret, de facia, had put Edward
I. out of
the
field altogether, but unfortunately an opportunity was
given him of interfering in the affairs of Scotlajid, which he
instantly took advantage of, and one step leadiiag to another,
lie at length determined on the complete subjugation of the

42
INVERNESSIANA.
country, and almost succeeded.
As
this
first opportunity
for interference arose
in part from the men
of Moray, we
have in those papers introduced the matter as not irrelevant
to the general design.
The Bishop of St Andrews and John
Comyn
of Badenoch,
two
of the
guardians
of
Scotland,
having
usurped
the
whole
authority,
allowed,
it
would
appear, a system x)f robhery and slaughter
to be carried on
against the men of Moray.
In consequence of this, and
early in the year
1291, an appeal
in name of Donald, Earl
of Mar, one of the seven Earls of Scotland, and of the men
of Moray, was lodged with Edward, which is hereafter given.
There were three appeals or protests taken in the presence
of the two Regents, and were recorded together, viz.
:
1. An appeal
for the seven
Earls of Scotland, of whom
Duncan, son of the late Earl of Fife, was one.
2. The appeal
for the Earl of Mar and
all the King of
Scotland's freemen of Moray, and
3. An appeal
for
Bruce,
that his claims
to
the Crown
were in danger of being disregarded in favour of Baliol.
It
is unnecessary
to
detail the various usurping acts of
Edward, but it
is intended in subsequent chapters
to give
some extracts connected with Inverness while under English
yoke.
Follows the copy appeal and protest, the blanks being in
the principal illegible
: —
Since ye Lord William, Bishop of St Andrews, and Lord John Cumyn, who
conduct and regard yourselves, as guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland, for
upholding and defending its approved laws, liberties, and customs
have
made and of your own authority substituted others as your deputies, for whose
substitution no authority or power was given you by the nobles, magnates, and
community of the Kingdom of Scotland
; And since these deputies your substi-
tutes came to the territory of Moray, which is under the immediate government
of the King of Scotland, and with the authority and i^ower committed them by
you, have there destroyed and plundered the lands and towns of the free men of
the Lord the King
of Scotland,
' burnt the
said
towns
and their
barns Jfull
of corn, carried away with them all the property of the said men of Moray, and
cruelly killed
as many men, women, and
little children
as they could come
at
: and as for these losses, injuries and sore troubles no amends have been made
by you or by your dex^uties
: "Wherefore, because of your failure
(to
make amends), and the injury inflicted upon the foresaid men of Moray by your
deputies,

injuries, losses, and conflagrations, in
order

These are by no means exhausted, and
it
is pro-

who issued the following protection 7th June 1292
:
The King to his beloved Stephen de Glynwhym
; Greeting
: Since Blacduff,
son
of Malcolm,
late Earl of Fife, who from the hearing of the Court of our
beloved
and
faithful John,
illustrious King of Scotland, has appealed to us,
from lack of justice and unjust judgment, and has urgently begged, that being

INVERNESSIANA.
45
ill consequence of foresaid appeal under our care, we should grant him our special
protection
; and as it is just that appellants pending their appeals be defended in
their right, we command you to guard and protect the foresaid Macduff with
his
household,
gear, and property, from injuries and violence of every kind,
as he
is,
pending said appeal before
us,
releas-ed as
to
all
things from
the
jurisdiction of said King and his people.
Moreover, we command
all our sub-
jects to obey and observe you in the premises and matters belonging thereto.
Step
by
step
this was followed np
until Edward
took
possession of Scotland by force.
In 1296, with great policy,
he ordered that their lands be restored to abbots, priors, and
other churchmen.
Letters patent were accordingly directed
to the different Sheriffs.
Amongst others
(1) Master Henricus de Banff', Chancellor of the Church
of Moray, has letters to the Sheriff of Inverness.
(2) The Master of the Knights Templars obtains letters
to various
Sheriffs, including those of Inverness, Cromarty
Dingwall, and Nairn.
(3) The Master of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem
in
Scotland,
obtains
letters upon the towns of Inverness,
Dingwall, and
others.
(4) The Abbot of Scone obtains
letters
to the Sheriff of
Inverness
; and
(5) William de Kinghorn, Parson of the Church of Kil-
tearn, obtains letters to the said Sheriff.
Ordinances were passed in favour of the wives of captives,
and
for the restoration
of lands held by sub-tenants and
others, thus
:—Eva, wife of Alexander Comyn, of Badenoch,
is allowed the sum of 30 merks yearly from the proceeds of
her own and her husband's
lands, of the King's " special
favour
for
her
support and
that
of her
children."
The
Countess of Ross
in like manner
is allowed £100.
These
grants are dated 4th September 1296.
Upon the 8th of September, on the application of Patrick
Earl of March and others for the restoration to said lords of
the lands of their immediate tenants, Sheriffs are commanded
to restore the lands and possessions of the immediate tenants
of certain lords and others who had come under the peace
of Edward, and
to retain
the possessions of such
as were
still in captivity.
Ingelramus de Gaynes has letters patent
to this purport to the Sheriff of Inverness, &c.
Upon
the
10th
of September 1296
the
following was
issued
:
It is commanded to all and sundry the men of John Comyn of Badenoch and
Lochaber, by the faith and love in which they are firmly bound to the King j
that to the
said Earl
(the Earl of Surrey, G-aardian of Scotland) as Guardian
of the King's Castles, fortalices,
islands, lands, and tenements foresaid, in
all
things which
pertain
to
that
Guardianship,
with
galleys and
all means of
navigation in their power—they be obedient, submissive, advising, and helping,
as often and whenever they shall be required by the said Earl on the
part of
the King for that purpose, and that they so demean themselves in the premises
that he can deservedly commend their diligent fidelity to the King,

46
INVERNESSIANA.
Upon the 7tli March 1297 the payment of the pensions of
the Friars of Inverness are included in the following order
:
The King to
his beloved and
faithful John de Warenne, Earl
of Surrey,
his Guardian of the Kingdom and territory of Scotland
; Greeting
: We com-
tnand you that ye search in the Rolls of Accounts of the times of Alexander and
John, late Kings of Scotland, for the rents of the towns of Berwick, Edinburgh,
Stirling, Glasgow, Ayr, Wigton,
Perth, Aberdeen, Montrose,
Elgir, and Inver-
ness,
to
give
to our beloved brethren in
Christ of the order of Predicatores
dwelling in these towns,
such sums
of the rents of said towns
for this
year,
of our charity and special favour, as they by the rolls of said accounts from the
time of the
foresaid John, appear to you yearly to have received, and to have
been allowed in the rendering of the accounts of the rents of the said towns by
the favour and charity of Alexander, late King of Scotland, and of the foresaid
John.
In 1305 in an ordinance for the stability of Scotland, the
following are nominated Justices
for the land beyond
the
Mountains (Us terres de la les monies)'.—Reginald
le Chien;
Johan de Yaux, Earl
of Northumberland; and Johan
de
Estrivelyn is nominated Sheriff of Inverness.
In the same
year, from Breviates of
the Petitions or Requests presented
to the King for lands or preferment in Scotland, the follow-
ing two are selected— Oliver Avenel
petitions for the lands
of John de la Haye, in the County of Inverness, which lands
the King had given him at the late war.
Cristyn del Arde,
wife of Hugh de Ross, petitions for the lands of Sir Lawrence
de
Strathbolgy
in
Sutherland and
Caithness,
as
also
the
lands of Alisandre Pilche, Burgess of Inverness.
Upon
this name, which
is frequently referred
to in the
older
titles belonging
to the Burgh, some remarks will be
made in our next.

DURING THE TROUBLES FROM 1290 TO 1306.
PART THIRD.
Patricius Pylche is one of the inquest regarding the death
of the ancestor of Patricius de Blanthyre in 1263.
During the reign of Robert Bruce, and immediately pre-
ceding years, Alexander
Pylche was one
of the principal
men of Inverness, and the first of the name found on record
in the north.
From the Chamberlain's Rolls, the following
extract is made
:
Account ot Alexander Pylche, Sheriff of Inverness, rendered at Scone the 7th
day of June, in the year
of grace 1328,
of the
contribution imposed
for the
preservation of peace.
First, he charges himself with £95 12s 63d for foresaid
contribution
levied from
all lands within his
jurisdiction, except that levied

INVERNESSIANA.
47
from the Earl of Moray and his tenants
; and with £90 12s 6^d for the contribution
levied from the lands of the said Earl and his tenants within said jurisdiction
for the same period.
The amount of his receipts are £186 5s
Id.
From which
there are allocated of the account in part for the collecting of foresaid contribu-
tion 32s.
And so he owes £184 13s Id.
Again,
in
1342, William
Ballock,
the
Chamberlain
of
Scotland, charges himself with 32s received from the Provost
of the burgh
of Inverness, for the account of William de
Ross, and with £6 13s 4d from the Provost of said burgh,
for the account of Alexander Pylche.
Alanus de Pylche, probably Alexander's
son, appears as
Sheriff- Substitute of Inverness in 1328.
The property, of Alexander Pylche would appear to have
been considerable.
He had lands at Direbught, in Church
Street, in Bridge Street, and in the East
Gate.
The name
of another of the family occurs frequently in old charters
—viz., that of Sir William Pylche, who was living in 1360,
and may also have been son of Alexander
By a deed of
1443, a feu of 2s is referred
to, as payable from a particate
of land on
the east
side of Church
Street, to
the heirs of
William Pylche, Lord of Gartly.
In another of 1453, the
granter is Mariota, daughter of the late Alexander
Pylche
burgess
of
Inverness,
with
consent
of John
Pratt,
her
husband, the subjects conveyed being a part of Castle Hill.
In 1455 Agnes, also a daughter of Alexander Pylche, con-
veys subjects in the East Gate of Inverness.
The position
of the property in Bridge Street of Sir William Pylche, on
the south
side
thereof, may be inferred with precision, for
the one adjoining to it is described as to the west, stretching
to the river Ness.
Lastly, in 1458, a deed is granted by a
lady styling herself Elizabeth Pylche, daughter and one of
the heiresses of William
Pylche, dominus de Cidcahock.
The
name is found still later.
The family of Comyn became very powerful in the reign
of Alexander
III.
and
subsequent
years.
In
the North
nothing escaped their grasp, and among other families who
for the time succumbed to their encroachments, was that of
Mackintosh.
The Mackintoshes continued keepers
of the
Castle of Inverness until
1271, when Ferchard, fifth chief,
died, leaving an only child, Angus, of tender
years.
Fer-
chard's
father, Shaw, had obtained liothiemurchus, as also
the lands of Meikle Geddes and Pate
;
and until Shaw's
death Ferchard lived in Badenoch, and was styled sometimes
Ferchard, son of Shaw, sometimes
Ferchard, Seneschall of
Badenoch.
Supported by the English faction, the Comyns,
in the minority of Angus Mackintosh, not only took posses-
sion of Geddes and Rate, but also of the Castle of Inverness,
~>

INVERNESSIANA.
and the connection of the Mackintoshes with the
locality
was
for
a
time
thus
broken.
This
apparent
ill-fortune
ultimately
tended
to
the
establishment
of the
family
of
Mackintosh on an enduring basis
;
for Angus Mackintosh,
being brought up with his maternal grandfather, Macdonald
of the Isles, was thrown into the society of Eva, heiress of
Clan Chattan.
They were married in 1292, she bringing to
her husband the great estate of Glen Lui and Loch Arkaig.
They
lived
for many
years
at
Tor
Castle,
the
principal
residence of the
chiefs of the ancient Clan Chattan.
Tor
Castle erected by Gillicattan Mor in the eleventh century,
is a picturesque ruin, strongly placed on a high rock over-
hanging
the river Lochy, where
in
its course
it abruptly
forms an angle.*
The Mackintoshes now hold in their Crown charters the
title of Seneschall of Lochaber, and as showing the antiquity
of the
office
there
is
here quoted a deed, dated in 1234,
wherein
one
of
the
witnesses
is
Edward,
Seneschall
of
Lochaber.
Though
partly
dislodged
from
their
original
estate, the family of Mackintosh have
still a considerable
stake in Brae Lochaber.
Follows the agreement
:
AaREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHAPTER OF THE CHURCH OP MORAY, AND ALEXANDER
DE STRYVELINE, REGARDING A HALP DAVOCH LAND OP DEVETH (DAVIOT).
This is the agreement made between the Chapter of the Church of Moray of
the one part, and the noble person Alexander de Stryveline of the other, viz.,
That the foresaid Alexander and his heirs if he any have, by his wife, viz,, the
daughter of that noble person Freskyn de Kerdal of happy memory, shall hold
in feu farm of the foresaid chapter, the half davoch of land which they have at
Deveth, and which belongs to the Church at the same place.
Giving therefor to
the foresaid Chapter for its common table yearly two merks for every service, and
demand pertaining to foresaid Chapter,
viz, , the one-half at Pentecost and the
other half at the feast of St Martin in winter next following, and performing the
military service attached to
foresaid lands.
And as often
as either shall con-
travene foresaid agreement he shall
in name of penalty give for the use of the
fabric of the Cathedral Church 20s, the agreement, however, shall continue and
be observed for ever.
And for the stable and undoubted testimony of the pre-
mises to that part of this writins; done in mode of Chirograph, which will remain
in the
possession of the foresaid noble person Alexander,
is affixed the Seal of
the Chapter of Moray, along with the Seal of Lord Andrew, Bishop of Moray, with
the subscription of the Canons.
And to that
jDart which
will remain
in the
IDOssession
of the Chapter of Moray, is appended the Seal of the before named
noble person Alexander de Stryveline, along with the Seal of the nobleman. Lord
Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteath, with the testimony of those who were engaged,
viz.. Lord F. Earl of
Ross, and Lord M. de Alto Monte, Sheriff
of Inverness
;
William Prath, Alexander Ruffi,
Merlesweyn, barons
; Fercard,
Seneschall
of
Badenoch,
Edward,
Seneschall of
Lochaber,
John and John,
clerics of
the
Bishop, and others.
Done in the year of G-race 1234."
This
deed
is
closely
connected with
the
Mackintoshes.
The present chief
is the direct descendant of Ferchard, the

of whose chiefs selected as their title that of

gratify a whim of the writer, Mr Rliind of Inverness, who visited the spot
with him in the summer of 1871, took measurements of, and projecting the ruins,

Seneschall of Badenoch, one of the witnesses
; he holds the
title of Edward,
Seneschall of
Lochaber, another
of
the
witnesses
; and is owner of the lands referred to in the deed.
Though long incorporated with a large farm, there are people
living who can point out Ach-na-heglash
or Kirktown of
Daviot.
Angus Mackintosh, who materially assisted Bruce, was
not restored
to his paternal
estate—indeed
it
is
said that
Bruce
demolished
the
Castle
of
Inverness—but
he was
recompensed by other lands.
The feud with the Comyns was
not
settled
until 1442, and then, so
far as regarded them
and the lands of Geddes and Kate, in a highly tragic way.
The family of Huntly were then rising into power in the
north, and Alexander, Lord Gordon, granted to Mackintosh
a charter of these lands,
still extant, on the 5th of October
1442.
Going, as the Mackintoshes supposed, to take peace-
able possession
in virtue of this
right, and accepting the
Comyns' invitation to the banquet, the feud was terminated
in
the manner narrated
in the Statistical Account
of the
parish of Croy and Dalcross.
The stone
to which one of
the Comyns affected to address himself; behind which one
of
the
Mackintoshes
listened, and
received
the warning
which turned the tables, and proved
fatal
to the would-be
murderers, has ever since this period, and is up to the present
day, regarded with interest by the house of Mackintosh.

ROBERT BRUOB.
1306-1329. PART FIRST.
So soon as fairly established on the throne, Bruce turned
his attention
to the settlement of all
differences and ques-
tions with Norway.
As
formerly
noticed,
the agreement
made by Alexander
III. was
ratified
; and at Inverness in
November
1312,
the adjustment
was made
between
the
kings of Scotland and Norway after quoted, of the mischief
caused bjC"evil_doers^ as they are styled.
Master Roger,
of Inverness7~Chancellor of Moray,
appears
to have been
engaged
in
all
northern
affairs
of
importance.
King
Robert, it will be observed, agreed to pay 600 merks in full
of all claims
for the Orkney affairs.
On the other hand,
satisfaction was given, inter alia, to the unhappy burgesses
of St Andrews, whose goods, amounting to £600 value, were
G

50
INVERNESSIA.NA.
seized, their persons imprisoned, and who, in the pathetic
language of the deed,
'' had, after long imprisonment, and
many other
difficulties, returned home empty."
This last
word though simple is full of significance.
Follows the memorandum between the kings of Scotland
and [Norway, dated at Inverness, November 1312
:
Blemorandum that in the year of the Lord 1312, on the Sunday next after the
feast of All Saints (Nov. 1.) at Inverness in Scotland.
The Most Serene Prince
Lord Haquin Fifth, by the Grace of God King of Norway, by his procurators and
special ambassadors. Lord Bernerus de Berkerey his baron, and Ivarus son
of
Olaus, Canon
of the Churches
of Bergen and Orkney on the one part ; and
Robert by the like Grace, King of Scots,
personally on the other part, met to
treat harmoniously regarding certain injuries and matters of discords between
said Kings, the kingdoms and inhabitants of
their kingdoms, which had arisen
and were committed, and
to
allay,
remove,
reform,
and
correct
the
same-
mutually.
At which day and place the procurators and Ambassadors of the
Lord King of Norway foresaid in name of the said King and his subjects whose
interest
it
concerned, sought
that amends
be made amicably, and obtained
for certain
injuries,
losses, and
troubles
inflicted and perpetrated upon
the
subjects of the said Lord King of Norway, and their possessions within
their
own lands of Orkney and Zetland, by certain evil doers from the said kingdom
of Scotland, both by invasion of the said lands of Orkney, and by the capture
of the nobleman Lord Bernerus Peff, Knight, Seneschall depute of the said Lord
King of Norway in those parts, who, though his own property was taken and
carried off by them, had of necessity to redeem his life out of the hands of the
evil doers, with the rents of the said Lord King, which
after
collecting and
levying in the foresaid parts at the time, he had in his x)Ossession.
The said
Lord King
of Scotland though he knew himself
to be ignorant
of the crime
perpetrated after this manner, and of the losses inflicted, and to be entirely free
of it, yet after having heard the ambassadors, from reverence for the
said Lord
King of Norway, he declared that the matter was clearly worthy of
belief, nor
did they hear anything else by report in the foresaid parts.
Wherefore, for the
sake
of the peace entered into between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland
in times past, and to cherish
in future a greater love, he agreed to give to the
said ambassadors,
in name
of the said Lord King of Norway,
for the
losses
inflicted in Orkney by the
foresaid
evil
doers, six hundred merks sterling, to
be paid to them in reckoned money in the Church
of St Magnus in Orkney
which sum
of money,
so promised for
said
losses, the
said procurators
and
ambassadors, in name of their said Lord, and their own, freely with consent, and
unanimously,
agreed to receive
in iDayment,
freeing the
said Lord
King
of
Scotland, his kingdom, and subjects for ever of^all obligation and action because
of any kind or hurt done to the said king of Norway, his kingdom, or subjects,
— so that if the losses incurred shall in any way extend beyond the sum of six
hundred merks, they
acknowledge by
these presents that
they have
wholly
conceded that,
leaving the punishment of
said malefactors and their
deserts
entirely to the pleasure of the foresaid King of Scotland
;—the amends to be
made for the losses sustained in Zetland, by consent of said ambassadors, remain
in
suspense
until
it
shall
clearly
a]3pear what the
extent
is,
after faithful
investigation be made by said ambassadors, and when the foresaid Lord King of
Scotland
shall be
sufiiciently informed
concerning
said
losses, he
will cause
reasonable amends to be made for the same.
Also, on the part of the said Lord
King of Scotland and his subjects, satisfaction was sought and granted in his
presence for the imprisonment of his burgesses and merchants
of the
city of
St Andrews in Scotland, who in no way committed
offence against the said
Lord King of Norway
or
his
subjects, and for the capture of their goods in
the kingdom of Norway by the ofiicers and
servants
of the said Lord King of
Norway while they were in his kingdom, which property amounts
to
the sum
of
six hundred pounds sterling, and of which pro^jerty the foresaid merchants
were not able to obtain restoration,
but,
after long imprisonment, and many
other
difficulties,
they
returned home
emj)ty.
Likewise
there was
sought
satisfaction and amends
for the
capture, punishment, and binding in fetters
of Patricius de Monte Alto, Knight of the said King of
Scotland, and for the
spoliation of his goods in the land of Orkney, by the Bailie of the Lord King of
Norway, and the
said Patricius, so detained in chains, was obliged to release

INVERNESSIANA.
51
himself from chains and save his life by payment of forty merks sterling.
And
said ambassadors,
considering
the
friendly reply
of
the
said
Lord
King
of
Scotland, and the reasonable satisfaction made to their jjetitions as was proper,
assembled, and delivered up, in name of their Lord the King of Norway aforesaid,
the goods of the foresaid merchants, taken in the kingdom of Norway, (by the
bailies of the King as said
is and detained there to this time) to be restored
and
fully surrendered
to
said merchants or their attorneys.
Accordingly, in
any case which occurred before the day of the making
of these presents,
said
goods, in like case, shall not be cai)tured again, just as if said merchants, with
their goods, while passing over from the kingdom of Norway were turned back,
as
if repulsed by tempest.
Also, they made amends and restoration for the
injuries inflicted upon, and the losses incurred by Patricius de Monte aforesaid,
sinoe the truth
has been discovered by faithful enquiry,
in presence of the
subjects of the said Lord King
of Scotland to that end deputed.
To observe
which
all
and
sundry
faithfully, the
foresaid
Bernerus de Berkereye, and
Ivarus, son
of Olaus, procurators and ambassadors of the Lord King of Norway
aforesaid, publicly swore on the soul of the said King and their own
; and the
said Lord King
of Scotland, by the venerable
father, Lord Ferchard, by the
Grace of God Bishop of Caithness, the nobleman, Lord Magnus, Earl of Caith-
ness, and the discreet man. Master Koger, of Inverness, Chancellor of the Church
of Moray, having a special mandate to this effect, swore publicly on his and their
souls.
In testimony of
all which the
present memorandum made in mode of
indented chirograph, one part of which, remaining in possession of the Lord King
of Norway,
is signed with the seal of the said Lord King of Scotland
; and the
other part,
remaining in possession
of
the
said
Lord King
of
Scotland,
is
signed, for the sake
of truth and steadfastness of good faith, with the
seals of
the
said ambassadors, in the name of their Lord, along with the
seals of the
venerable
father. Lord William, by the
Grace of God Bishop of Orkney, and
of the nobleman, Lord Magnus, Earl of Caithness and Orkney,
XXIL
ROBERT BRUCE.
1306-1329. PART SECOND.
In the great Charter by Bruce to his nephew of the Earl-
dom of Moray, from which
parts
are hereafter quoted,
it
may be observed that the King granted
full
lieutenancy
and
regality—in fact,
as much as
it was possible to grant.
Randolph thus became not only Earl, but
in
effect King
of
Moray,
with
full,
complete,
and
sole
jurisdiction
within the limits
of the province.
It
is to be noted that
the
ancient
burghs
of
Elgin,
Forres,
and
Nairn,
which
formerly held of the King, were to some extent deprived of
their former privileges, being ruled in future to hold of the
Earl of Moray and
his heirs, thereby undoubtedly lowering
their
status.
Inverness
is, however, excepted.*
From
it
Randolph
is only to draw
certain emoluments, the town's
* The following translation of part of the Charter, given in the
Second Edition of
Shaw's Moray,
is unique
:—Salvo etiam nobis,
et heredibus nostris, in hac donationa
nostra, hurgo Nostra de Inverness, cum loco Castelli, et terris ad dictum hurgxiyn pertln-
entibus, cum piscatione aquae de Ness,
&c.,
&c.
Thus
translated—Reserving
also
from this our donation, to ourselves and to our heirs, our Citadel of Inverness, with the
ground of the Castle, and the lands pertaining to the said Citadel, with the fishery of
the river Ness, &c., &c.

52
INVERNESSIANA,
liberties and
privileges remaining unaltered.
The
site of
the
Castle
is
also
reserved,
which would
infer
that
the
building had been demolished during the preceding troubles,
but that it was intended to re-establish a stronghold.
EXTBACTS FROM BRUCe's CHARTER TO RANDOLPH.
After granting full lieutenancy throughout the Province
of Moray, the Charter proceeds
:
Together with our great custom of the burgh of Inverness and with the cocket
therof, with their liberties in all things, excepting onlj- the small custom of said
burgh, witli full power of attaching, accusing and in all administering and judging
all of said Sheriffdom who
shall do
skaith,
hurt,
or
loss unduly to
foresaid
custom, as freely in all things as we or any of our officials might in the i^remises
attach, accuse, administer or judge said transgressors
; and that the said Earl
and his heirs may in future as freely and quietly hold and possess the
fines,
escheats, and forfeitures thereto
belonging
as we or any
of our ^predecessors
have at any time held said fines, escheats, or forfeitu.res
: Wiierefore we strictly
charge and command our Sheriff of Inverness and his
officers, and the Provosts
and officers of said burgh who may for the time be, and others whom it concerns
that they be attending and succouring, advising and assisting in the premises the
foresaid Earl and his heirs foresaid and their
officers, our royal power being
invoked in this matter, if it be necessary without any other special mandate of
ours intervening.
"We will also and grant that the said Thomas and his heirs
foresaid have,
hold, and possess said Earldom with the Manor-house of Elgin,
which we also wish to be held and called as the chief Mansion-house of
the
Earldom of Moray, with
all other Manor-houses, burghs, towns, thanages, and
all our royal lands,
rents, and exits contained within foresaid marches, with
advocations of churches, &c.
We also will and grant from us and our heirs that
all barons and free tenants of said Earldom who hold of us and our predecessors
in chief (in capite) and their heirs,
shall perform to the said Thomas and his
heirs foresaid, homage, fealty,
sxiit, court, and
all other services, and shall also
hold
their baronies and tenements
of him and his
heirs
foi'esaid,
reserving,
however, the barons and free tenants foresaid and their heirs, and the rights
and liberties of their courts in so far as
rightly used.
"We also
will and grant
that the burghs and
their burgesses of Elgin,
Forres, and Invernarne (Nairn)
have and exercise the same liberties which they had in
the time
of Lord Alex-
ander King of Scots foresaid and in ours, reserving only this that they held of
us without mediate (Sine medio), and now they hold of the said Earl with said
liberties
: Reserving also to us and our heirs in this our donation our burgh of
Inverness with the site (loco) of the Castle and the lands pertaining to said burgh
with the fishing of the Water of Ness, and with the mills of said burgh with the
sequel of said burgh and of the lands belonging to said burgh only.
At page 26 of Robertson's Index, reference is thus made to
Thomas
Randolph
:—" Carta
to Thomas Ranulph, Earl of
Murray, the isle of Man, 100 merks sterling, at Inverness."
He also obtained a charter of the new customs and coquet
of Inverness, to which the foregoing doubtless refers.
The King
in
1313
granted
a
charter
to
the
friars
of
Inverness of a yearly gift of £10 sterling in these terms
:
Robert by the Grace of God King of Scots,—To
all good men of his whole
realm
; Greeting
: Know all present and future, that for the honour of God, and
of the glorious Virgin Mary His mother, and

Churchmen did not always agree among themselves, and
amongst others the house of Pluscarden seem
to have dis-
owned the authority of the Bishop of Moray.
They were,
however, brought to confess their
errors.
For, on the 20th
October 1345, there met in the chapter-house of the Cathe-
dral Church of Moray, Lords John and Richard, Bishops of
Moray and Dunkeld, the Dean and Chapter of Moray, and
others, before whom William of Inverness and Adam Young,
monks of the house of the vale of St Andrew of Pluscardy,
of their own accord confessed under pain of excommunica-
tion
;
and acknowledged
that
the Bishops
of Moray
had,
have, hold, and exercised visitation and
correction as often
as
it seemed expedient
to them, and
that they
also have
power to appoint and remove priors and friars in said house.

ROBERT BRUCE.
1306-1329, PART THIRD.
In the year 1325, Robert
directs a precept
to the Sheriff
of Inverness, to do full and speedy justice at the suit of the
burgesses of Inverness, against all invading their privileges,
by buying and selling in prejudice of them and the liberties
of the
burgh.
Mr Roger
of Inverness,
clericus,
in
this
reign, receives a charter of the lands of Fintray and Balmaly,
in
Buchan.
There
is
also
a memorandum
of complaint
lodged against the Sheriff of Inverness, by Simon Fraser and
Margaret his wife.
It was observed in the preceding chapter that Randolph
bad plenary power in the province of Moray.
It
is men-
tioned in the Scoti-chronicon " that he (Randolph) continued

INVERNESSIANA.
on in his course dispensing justice even to Inverness, where
it was told the Judge
that a certain person
lately returned
from
the Court of Rome, had been found by chance in the
court of justice, who was arrested
for
the slaughter
of a
priest, and accused of spilling the blood of a loyal subject.
Although
it was
sufficiently shown he was absolved from
the crime, yet it was necessary that he should be punished
for the
offence, and
by a punishment
so much the more
severe, as he was not afraid
to have laid
sacrilegious hands
upon the anointed
(priest) of the Lord.
The murderer of
the priest
is
accordingly destroyed,
his blood
is returned
upon
his own
hand, and
the justice of the just judge
is
extolled on all hands."
The
historian
adds
'^ And
neither
is
it
a
wonderful
matter
if a
secular judge avenges
the murder of a priest,
since even an ecclesiastical judge punishes
this crime.
For
we read that in the diocese of Moray, a certain knight slew
a
priest, and immediately sought
to be
absolved
by
his
ordinary, John, Bishop de Molendinis.
The Bishop, how-
ever, knowing that a case
of this kind should be reserved
for
his Apostolic superior, sent him to the Court of Rome,
where he obtained absolution
;
and on his return he brought
a
letter
to
the
Bishop,
setting
forth
that
he
had
been
absolved, and nothing remained but that the Bishop should
enjoin him a salutary penance.
He (the Bishop) gave him
permission
to
die
in prison, testifying in
this way, before
God and men, that he inflicted a salutary penance upon him
for his crime."
Prior to this period, there were but few charters, and the
answer of the barons to the King, that
their swords were
their rights, was doubly true.
In the reign of David II.,
however, and
especially after his return from
captivity, the
charters and records become
so numerous, that
in place of
painfully searching for any documents whatever, in a reign,
it will now be necessary
to make
selections.
Very many
writs, dating from 1365 to 1500 remain, which illustrate in
a great measure the holding of property within the burgh
and its territory.
In the reign of Robert Bruce, in all probability, lived the
last
in the male line of the proprietors of Auld
Castlehill,
but his surname is, so far as we are aware, unknown.
Where
the names of the burgesses of Inverness are given, prior to
David II., it
is only their Christian names, for instance
in an agreement between
the
Bishop
of Ross and John
Byzett regarding the church and lands of Kiltarlity, one of
the witnesses
is Peter, burgess of Inverness.
This deed is

INVERNESSIANA.
dated
in
1226.
The
two
sisters,
heiresses
of
the
Auld
(^yVi^v^^^
Castle, appear
in the reign of David II. , and were named
/.^/u-L
Susanna and Edua.
That one of these married a Cuthbert,
'^-^^^'^
through whom that family acquired Castlehill about 1368,
A^v^
has hitherto been generally considered correct.
If, however,
this were so, the male line again failed about a century later,
for we find betwixt the years 1440 and 1456 frequent men-
tion made of Donald of the Auld
Castle, who is witness to
j
many deeds.
No surname
is given
to him, and
in 1458 a
j
deed is found bearing to be granted by Elena Guys (Gray ?),
\
lady
of Auld
Castle, with
consent
of Thomas
Gray, her
i
husband, wherein
she
refers
to her predecessor and uncle,
-i
Donald of the Auld Castle.
!
In the brieve granted by James VII., in the year 1686, to
satisfy the descent from gentle blood of the French Minister,
I
Colbert, the latter traces himself thus
:—Edward, his seventh
'
progenitor, in a right line, settled in France
; being a son of
Edward, younger son of Castlehill, his mother being Mar-
garet Lindsay of Edzell.
The grandfather of Edward who
settled in France was George Cuthbert of Castlehill, married
i
to Marjory Rose of Kilravock.
George was son of James of
-^
Castlehill by Joan
Eraser of
Foyers.
James was son of
George
of
Castlehill
by
Catherine
Dunbar
of
Tarbat.
I
George was son of James Cuthbert, baron of Castlehill, and
Lady Elizabeth Lyon of Glammis, a descendant of the Lord
Glammis, son-in-law of Robert II.
With
this James
the pedigree commences abruptly, and
it
is
matter of regret that
it cannot be
cleared up
satis-
factorily how
or when
the
Cuthberts
acquired
Castlehill.
I
That they
had an
extraordinary
hold
in
the burgh and
i
neighbourhood betwixt
the
years
1550
and 1700
is
un-
I
doubted,
and
we
conclude
this
chapter
by
giving
the
i
declaration
of the

of Inverness

of 1660, in illustration of their number and position in the

Council at that period
We do sincerely affirm and declare that we judge it unlawful to subjects upon

And that all these gatherings, convocations, petitions, protestations, and erect-

carrying on of the late troubles were unlawful and seditious

thereafter), and the other intituled A Solemn League and Covenant, were and

DAVID
II.
1329-1370. PART FIRST.
One
of
the
first deeds
in
this
reign,
connected
with
Inverness and
its neighbourhood,
is a charter dated at the
Castle of Urquhart, on the 4th of July 1342, granted by
William,
Earl
of
Ross,
in
favour
of
Reginald,
son
of
Roderick of the
Isles, of ten davochs of land in Kennetal,
lying,
it
is
said,
in
the county of
Argyle.
The
gather-
ing
in
the
Castle
was
important,
as
the
following
are
described as witnesses
:—The Venerable Fathers in
Christ
Lords John and Roger, by
the grace of God, Bishops
of
Moray and Ross;
Robert de Lauder, James de
Kerdale,
and William de Mowbray, Knights
; Sir Thomas de Lichton,
Canon of Moray, John de Barclay, Adam de Urcharde, John
Young de Dyngwall, and many others, cleric and laic.
This
charter is confirmed by King David in the year 1344.
William, last of the Earls of Ross
of the original
line,
granted two
charters
of two davochs of land—viz.. South
Kinrara and Dalnavert, in Badenoch, in favour of Malmoran
of Glencharny.
The
first
is without
date, but
the above
William de Mowbray, and John de Barclay, are witnesses.
The second charter is dated at Nairn the 22d day of Novem-
ber 1338.
Nearly a century
later
these
charters
are
for
some object confirmed by Alexander de Yla, Earl of Ross,
great grandson of William, whose confirmation
is dated
at
Kessock,
before
these witnesses
:— Celestine
of
the
Isles,
his son, John Macleod
of Glenelg, Torquil Macleod of the
Lews, John Ross of Balnagown, George Munro of Fowlis,
Nigel Macleod, his Seneschal, Nigel Flemyng, his Secretary,
with many others.
There
is no
date, but
it was probably
between 1428 and 1448.
In 1497
these
lands, which had
meantime been attached to the Barony of Dunachton, passed
on the marriage of the heiress of the Barons Macniven, to
the family of Mackintosh.
This Kinrara was
styled of old

INVERNESSIANA.
57
Kinrara-na-choille, Kinrara of the woods, a
title which
it
merits to this day, because of the
fine timber which grows
there naturally.
Upon
the
31st
December
1344, King David grants
a
letter in favour of
the Burgesses
of Inverness, which we
think has never hitherto been noticed.
It has neither date
nor witnesses.
The letter is in these terms
:
David by the Grace
of God, King of Scots, to all good men,
his subjects, to
whom these present letters shall come
; Greeting
: Know that we have granted
to our Bui'gesses of Inverness, and their heirs, that no Justiciar,
or any other
servant
of
ours, except our
Chamberlain, to whom
it pertains by
office
[ex
officio) shall sit in judgment or investigate
as to the correction or punishment
of the measures or weights of our said Burgesses of Inverness— the investigation,
correction, and punishment of which we commit for ever to our Chamberlain only
by these presents
;
Therefore
let
all, whose interest
it
is, know that we com-
mand and order that no one i^resume to harass or annoy our said Burgesses of
Inverness
in any way in
face of
this our grant, under the pain
of losing
all
that according
to our royal laws (regiam majestatem nostram) he might lose:
In testimony of which matter our seal is appended to these presents.
Given at
ISTetherdale the last day of December in the year of our reign the sixteenth.
There can now be little doubt that the Parochial Church
of Inverness, dedicated to St Mary, stood within the Chapel
Yard Burial-ground, or that the High Church stands on the
site
of the church
dedicated
to
St Michael.
During the
reign of David II. frequent donations and
sales were made
to the churches and altarages in Inverness, and amongst the
earliest now extant is the following sale by Nicholas, of the
burgh of Forres,
to
the Altar
of the Holy
Cross,
in the
Parochial Church of St Mary's, dated at Inverness on the
4th day of February 1363
:
To all who shall see or hear of this charter Nicholaus de fforays, grandson and
heir of Thomas Gryme, late burgess of Inverness
; Greeting in the Lord
: Know
that I for the increase of divine worship in lieu of 40s. in reckoned money, paid
by Master Eustachius, now Vicar of Inverness and burgess
thereof, and by
me fully received, have
sold,
given, grantef^, and by this my present charter,
confirmed to God and to the Altar of the Holy Cross,
in the Pai-ochial Church
of Inverness, and for the maintenance of a chaplain there, to worship for ever,
one
acre
of my arable land lying in the upper plain of the old Castle of Inver-
ness, called the Mill -flat,
extending in breadth 'twixt the land of the said Holy
Cross at the west on the one part, and the land of John Scott, burgess of the
said burgh of Inverness, at the east on the other, and in length from the high-
way of the mill called the King's, on the south at the head, stretching towards
le Bromybanc to the north at the end
:
To be held ancl had the said acre of land
with the pertinents by God, and the Altar of the Holy Cross foresaid, and the
chaplain worshipping there, of me and my heirs for ever, freely, quietly, wholly,
and honourably
: And
I, Nicholaus de
fforays
aforesaid, and my heirs,
shall
warrant, acquit, and for ever defend the said acre of land, with the pertinents
to the foresaid Altar of the Holy Cross, and to the chaplain there who shall for
the time be
celebrating
divine worship against
all men and women
: And
if
it happens, which God forbid, that I, my heirs, assignees, and others who
shall
succeed us by whatsoever title, go against, or impugn this ray pious sale, donation,
and concession, I oblige me, and my heirs, assignees, and all others our s.uccessors
by whatsoever
title,
in one hundred shillings
sterling,
to be paid in name of
penalty before any legal steps, towards
the fabric
of the Cathedral Church of
Elgin; Renouncing hereby
all remedy
of
law, canonical or civil,—this x^resent
Charter, however, to remain for ever in its own strength
;
In witness of which
thing my seal is appended to this present Charter, and for the greater security
and evidence of this transaction, I have procured and caused
to be appended
H

to the present Charter the common
seal of the Burgh of Inverness, together
with
the
seal
of
the foresaid
Master Eustachius,
vicar
thereof.
Given at
Inverness, the fourth day of the month of February, in the year of the incar-
nation
of the Lord
13G3.
Witnesses—John Scott, John
de Coule, Welande
de Scykkhwv (Chishohn), Thomas
le Grant,
William
the
Doomster, Thomas
Dyll, Briseus Pyot, Symon, son of Henry, Andrew Chepman, burgess of the said
place of Inverness, and many others.
The acre
in question would appear
to form part of the
lands of Milnfield, and the deed shows the antiquity of the
name of Kingsmills.
XXV.
DAVID II.
1329-1370.
PART SECOND.
John Scot, burgess of Inverness, was a liberal benefactor
of the Church
at Inverness
in
this
reiorn.
The
followino:
deed is entitled, though not quite correctly, " The Founda-
tion of the Chapel, and also of the Chaplaincy of the Blessed
Virgin Mary
of
Inverness."
The two roods
in
question,
with
the house
to be
built
thereon
for the
chaplain, no
doubt lay at the back of the present wall of the Chapel
yard,
and now
form
part
of
the
glebe
of
the
second
minister of Inverness
:
To all who
shall see or hear of this
writ, John Scot, burgess
of Inverness,
wishes salvation in the Lord
: Let all know that I am bound and by good faith
am more firmly obliged
to Sir Ade (Adam) de Narryn,
chaplain, and
to the
chaplains his successors who may, for the time, be in the chapel of the Blessed
Virgin Mary of Inverness, for the purpose of continually performing their divine
functions, in the sum of a hundred
shillings of
sterling money, to
be received
annually from me and my heirs for ever, at two terras in the year, to wit, the
one half at the feast of Pentecost (Whitsunday), and the other half at the feast
of St Martin in the winter (Martinmas).
I also confess that I and my heirs are
bound to build for the said Sir Ade and the chai>lains
his successors in time to
come, in the first year of the said Sir Ade's entrance on his duties, a suflScient
dwelling-house upon the two roods of land lying contiguous to the wall of the
burying ground of the foresaid chapel on the eastern side thereof, one of which
roods Matilda Deefe (Dyll ?) presented to the foresaid chapel
; but the second I
and my heirs hold of the Vicar of Inverness who may for the time be, and also
to build a sufiicient fence round about the said dwelling-house and a passage
leading to the same, at the term of the entrance upon oflice of the said Sir Ade,
beginning at the feast of the apostles Philip and James (1st May), of the year of
grace 1362
:
To be held and possessed, the foresaid two roods of land, with the
dwelling-house, passage, and pertinents whatsoever, by the said Sir Ade and the
chaplains his successors for ever of me and my heirs, freely, quietly, and peace-
ably
; which two
roods
of land
with the
dwelling-house,
passage, and
their
j)ertinents as said
is, I and my heirs
sliall warrant and defend to the foresaid
Sir Ade and the chaplains his successors for ever against all mortals
:
And if it
happen that I or my heirs, which God forbid, fail in the payment of
the said
sum of money within the twentieth day after the lapse of any of the above said
terms, or resile in any way whatever from any of the foresaid obKgations to the
hurt
of the
foresaid Sir Ade, or
of
his
successors, I and they shall
give, for
every week during which we shall
abstain from making payment of the
said
sum
of
money,
two
shillings
sterling
in name
of i)euahy,
to
be
devoted

INVERNESSIANA.
59
to
the
lighting
of the
Holy
Cross
of
the
Cathedral
Chinch
of
Elgin
And I, John Scot foi'esaid, and my
heirs,
shall
give, we hcing induced thereto
by special affection, every year to the said Sir Ade, for
all the term of his life
only, a
tit and
suitable robe
(adorned) with
fur, at the
feast of St Andrew's
(November 30th) in the winter, to be worn by himself.
I have also given up for
uie and my heirs to the said Sir Ade, for the term of his
life only, one acre of
my land, lying in the Shypflat (Ship lands), between the land
of William, sur-
named "Walkere, at the south on the one
side, and my own land on the other
in
breadth, and
in
length between the
highway, which
is
called Scathegat,
and the water of Ness
; And for the observing of the premises, all and
each
faithfully, I bind me and my heirs, and
all
the lands and possessions which we
have, or in time to come may have, within and without the burgh of Inverness
:
And,
if
it happen, which Cod
forbid,
that
I or any one
of my heirs con
travene the premises, or any of the premises, or say them nay in any way, we
shall give in name of penalty to the edifice of the Cathedral Church of
Elgin,
before the beginning of any lawsuit, one hundred pounds sterling, notwithstand-
ing the present obligation, which shall endure perpetually in
its own
strength,
and we submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Moray, and of
his
official who may for the time be, that it may be lawful to them or one of them
to compel us more strictly to observe all the premises by every manner of eccle-
siastical
censure.
In
testimony
of
all which my
seal
is
to
these
presents
appended
; and for the greater security, I have procured to be appended to these
presents the seal of the venerable father in Chiist, Lord John, by the Grace of
God, Bishoi) of Moray, along with the seal of a discreet man. Master Eustachius,
now
vicar of
Inverness,
Given
at
Inverness, the
8fch day
of
the month
of
August, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord, 1361.
Members of congregations who delight in presenting their
favourite ministers with
Geneva gowns, may take a hint
from
the worthy John
Scot, who gave the chaplain, at
the
beginning of each winter,
a robe adorned with
fur, which
enabled him not only to make a creditable appearance, but
also protected him against the blasts of winter.
The following by John of Inverness, Chancellor of Moray,
is
curious,
in
respect
of
its minute
directions
as
to
the
keeping up of prayers for the dead, and the avoidance, as it
is termed, of the souls " being long without the wonted aids
of
intercession."
A time
was
coming when
the
wishes
of
this
devout
John,
who
prayed
that
God
Omni-
potent might visit and protect the conservors of his ordina-
tion,
but divine
justice
strike the
violators, were
to
be
set at nought.
In Inverness all the churches, church-yards,
manses, and
salaries, were granted
to the burgh, burdened
with
certain meagre allowances
for elemosynary
purposes.
Follows John's bequest
:
John of Inverness, Chancellor of the Church of Moray, to all who shall inspect
the present
letters
;
Greeting, eternal in
the Lord
: Know
all, that
since my
Lord John de Moravia, Pantler
of Scotland and
his
heirs, are held obliged to
pay at Elgin yearly for ever to me and my assignees, eight merks sterling as in
his charter made
to this
effect
is more
fully contained,
I,
the foresaid John,
ordain and assign six merks of the foresaid eight merks to be paid ye:\rly for ever
at two terms of the year ; to
wit one-half within 15 days
after the feast of
Pentecost, and the other half within 15 days
after the feast
of St Martin in
winter, to a chaplain to worship for ever in behalf of my soul, the souls of my
father and mother,
the
soul
of
Lord Andrew de
Moravia, of good memory,
father of the
foresaid John, and
the souls
of
all
the
faithful dead,
at
the
Altar
of the Holy Cross
in the Church
of
the. Holy Trinity of Elgin, which
chaplain shall wear a habit
in the Church and at
all divine hours both day and
night, as
shall be held
to be that of
a chaplain founded in the church
for the

60
INVERNESSIA.NA.
fii'st time
: Item—I ordain and assign two shillings and eight pence of annual
rent to be paid yearly into the treasury for j)roviding bread,
wine, and wax for
the foresaid chaplain
; And I desire that when the foresaid chaplain goes away,
another be appointed in his place as quickly as possible, that the souls foresaid
may not long be without the wonted
aids of intercession.
Item—I ordain and
assign ten shillings of annual rent together with other ten shillings elsewhere
assigned, to be distributed yearly on the day of my anniversary in the same
manner as distribution is made on the anniversary of Master John de Spaldyng.
Item—I ordain and assign ten shillings of annual rent,
to be distributed yearly
on the day of the anniversary of Lord Andrew de Moravia among the chajjlains
and vicars who with distinction are personally engaged in performing the duties
of his funeral
rites—the absent and unpunctual are totally exchided.
Item
I ordain two shillings
to be paid yearly for ever
for the lighting of the Holy
Cross, and two shillings sterling for the lighting of the Blessed Virgin Mary, so
that the church and the holders of said lights may be able yearly on the day of
the anniversary of the
foresaid Lord Andrew, when they
are performing the
offices of the dead
for him, to serve four wax
lights burning round
his tomb.
May the Grace of God Omnipotent now visit and protect the conservors of this
my present ordination, but let divine justice strike the violators.
Amen
!
In
testimony of which matter my seal together with the common seal of the chapter
is appended
to these presents.
Given at the Chanonry of Elgin in the year of
the Lord 1351, the 20th day of the month of April.
John
de
Moravia,
Panetarius
(Pantler)*
of
Scotland,
founded a chaplaincy from the rents of Altirlies and Croy,
under the following circumstances
:—Master John of Inver-
ness,
before-mentioned,
wishing
to
found
and
endow
a
chaplainship within the Church of Moray, for the good of
his
soul, and
that
of Andrew de Moravia, gave John de
Moravia the sum of 100 merks, so as to provide an annual
rent of eight merks.
This shows that the rate then current
was eight per cent.
Accordingly John de Moravia acknow-
ledged
the money, and
granted
an
obligation
as above.
The foregoing deed is the order by Master John of Inverness
for its distribution.
The foundation is confirmed two years
afterwards, in 1353, by Thomas de Moravia, younger brother
of John.

1329-1370. PART THIRD.
As many writings connected with Inverness at this period
refer to pious donations, it is proper to give explanations of
some of the offices and duties performed, in order to enable
the reader the better to understand the objects of the deeds.
The
following extract from Shaw contains these explana-
tions,
perhaps
in
as
distinct and popular a form as can
be desired
:
Chaplains were those clergy who officiated in chajjels ; and these chapels were
of different kinds.
In parishes of great extent, Chapels of Ease were erected in distant
corners
for the conveniency of the aged and infirm, and the rector of the parish main-
tained a curate there to read prayers and sing masses.
Vestiges of such chapels
are to be seen in many parishes.
Some chapels were called Free
Chapels, which were not dependent on any
parish, but had proper endowments for their own ministers, whose charge was
called "a chaplainry," and the minister " a parochial chaplain."
Generally such chapels
as had
churches,
church-yards, and
glebes were, I
think, either Chajpels of Ease or Free Chapels.
Besides these, there were domestic chapels or oratories built near the residence
of great men, in which the domestic chaplain or priest officiated.
Such chapels were at Calder, Kilravock, Boharm, &c.
And almost in every parish there were private chaj)els, one or more, built by
private persons, that masses might be said or sung there for their own souls and
that of the souls of their friends.
Some small salary was mortified for that end, and usually granted to the priest
of the parish.
In the College of Elgin, I find the private Chapels of St John, St Thomas, St
Colin, and the Holy Cross.
The office
of saying mass
in such chapels was called chantry
or chanting
masses.
The salary for the priests' officiating, or saying mass at an altar, was
called altarage.
The service performed for the dead, how soon they expired, was the Obit, and
the register of the dead was called obituary.
In the first antiphone of the office of Obit are the words Dirigc nos Domine,
and hence came the Dirge.

Sir
Robert de Chisholm's deed to the Holy Rood is after
quoted.
It is in beautiful preservation with Sir Robert's seal
fresh and
entire.
The
proceedings of a
court held by Sir
Robert are also given.
There appear to have been two Sir Roberts—father and
son.
The
second
Sir
Robert
Chisholm's
issue
in
male
descent shortly failed.
The present family of Chisholm are
descended of Alexander Chisholm, second son of the
first
Sir Robert, who married Margaret of the Ard, and
as por-
tion er of the Ard
does homage
to
the
Bishop
of Moray
in 1368.
The
lands
contained
in
Sir
Robert's
deed,
form
those
known as Direbught, mortified to, and now in possession of,
the kirk-session
; and thus, though
indirectly, the revenues
go as
directed by Queen Mary's
charter, when gifting the
Church
revenues
within
the
territory
of
the
burgh
of
Inverness after the Reformation.
Sir Robert's deed
is endorsed,
*' A charter of six
acres
pertenand to ye Rud," and is as follows
:
To all who shall see or hear of this charter, Sh' Robert de Chesolme, Lord of
the same, wishes eternal salvation in the Lord
: Since it is known to all that all
flesh returns into dust, and that there
is nothing after death except He who is
the true safety and who redeemed the human race on the cross
; Hence I make
it known to all by these presents that
I have
given, granted, and by this my
present charter confirmed
for the salvation of my soul, and of the souls of my
successors and
predecessors, and
of
all
the
faithful, six
acres of
arable land
lying
within
the
territory
of
the
old
castle
in the
lower
plain
thereof,
between the land of Edua of the said old castle, in breadth at the east on the
one side, and
the land which
is called
le Burrojelde at the west on the other,
and in length stretching from the common highway of our Lord the King at the
south, and the land which
is
called Hcvydland
at
the
norfch, for making an
increase of divine worship for ever to the altar of the Holy Rood of Inverness.
To be held and had the said six acres of land by the said altar of the Holy Rood of
the said Church for making perpetual increase there, from me and my heirs and
assignees, freely,
quietly, fully and honourably, and according
as
I, the
said
Lord, gave, or could
give, within the kingdom of
Scotland, all and
sundry, or
particular
lands
for
the
increase
of
chapel,
church,
or
of
any
other,
by all right possible, canonical or civil, the said six acres of land.
I acknowledge
by these presents that
I have given and granted them
freely, quietly, clearly
and honourably, for ever, and
I, the foresaid Robert, my heirs, successors, and
assignees, whomsoever shall warrant, and acquit, and for ever, defend the said
six acres to the foresaid altar of the Holy Rood of the foresaid Church of Inver-
ness, for
the subsistence
of one chaplain
there, performing
(divine worship)
;
and if it happen that I, my heirs, successors, or
assignees whomsoever,
contra-
vene
this my
pious
donation
and
grant,
which
God
forbid,
I
will
and
grant, as
also by these
presents
oblige my
person, the persons
of my
heirs,
successors, and
assignees
whomsoever, and the
lands
of
myself, my
heirs,
successors, and assignees, for ever, as far as by law I shall be able in any manner,
to be excommunicated, interdicted, and bound by every manner of ecclesiastical
censure, by means of the Bishop of Moray, who for the time shall be, or of his
chapter
; under
x^enalty of
forty pounds of good sterling money, to be paid to
the building of the Cathedral Chiirch of Moray before any step of law, without
any remission
; this present charter, nevertheless, enduring by its own strength.
In witness of which thing my seal
is
api^ended to these presents
; and
for the
greater security and evidence of this
matter, I have
procured and caused the
seals of the chapter
of the Church
of Moray and
of the
official
of the same,
along with the seal of the community of the burgh of Inverness, to be appended
to this present charter
: Given at Inverness on the feast of the exaltation of the

follows
:

held by me, Robert
de Cheshelme, Lord
of
that
Ilk,
Justiciary
of
the said.
Regality of Moray, at Le Ballocis Hill near Inverness, the 26fch day of January
in the year of Grace 1376, and in presence of the noble and powerful Lord John
de Dunbarre, Earl
of Moray
: Compeared at the
bar, James, son
of Stephen,
burgess of
Inverness, cited by "William Lambe, Sheriff
of
said
Regality, in the
Sheriffdom
of
Inverness, to answer and show
in what manner and in what
way he held and possessed
those six acres of land lying on the west side of the
land of Deyrbowchte (Direbught), between the land of the nobleman Sir William
Pylche on the one side, on the one part and the Highland Road (viam Scoticanam)
by which we go
to Drekechys
(Drakies) towards the
south, on
the
other, in
breadth.
The said James mentioned that he occupied and held the
said six
acres of land of the sisters Eufamia and Edua, once owners of the old Castle, in
feu and heritage, and he likewise produced the charters of the said ladies of the
old Castle.
Patricius de Crawfourde, as mandatory of said noble and powerful
Loi'd John de Dunbarre,
Et^.rl of Moray, asserted in name and on behalf of said
noble Earl that any one
holding any land
in
feu and heritage
cannot
sell or
alienate the same without permission of and confirmation by his Lord Superior,
specially procured or obtained for that purpose.
But the same James alleges in
his own behalf that he had a good and
clear confirmation
of
said
six acres of
land by the grandfather of the said noble Lord John de Dunbar, Earl of Moray,
viz.—by Lord Thomas Ranulphi's father, late Earl of Moray.
The said Patricius-
de Crawfourde thereupon
sought sight
of said
confirmation
: Whereupon the
said James protested and clearly showed that the said confirmation had been in
safe keeping along with
his very many other evidents in
the custody of a late
j)articular friend in the house of the Preachiug Friars of Inverness, and had been
burnt there and completely destroyed, at the time of the burning oT said house.
Upon this, the said Patricius asked for caution.
The said James asked permis-
sion
from
the
judge
to
go
to
advise
and
consult
with
his
friends
about the finding of said caution.
The said James was allowed, and went away
under sure caution for a little while out of court in company with his advisers.
So when James had taken counsel, he returned and presented himself in court,
declaring and finding the said caution that the said confirmation was completely
burnt
as aforesaid, and upon
this he placed himself
at the disposal and deter-
mination of an assize of the good men of his country.
Whereupon Patricius de
Crawfourde, by express command of said noble Lord the Earl of Moray, collected
and raised for the disposal and determination of the i)remises, the better, the
more ancient, and more
faithful of those then
in
attendance at
said
court, a
great oath being administered
to them,
viz., those underwritten noblemen
Sirs Robert de Innes and AVilliam Pylchee, Knights
; Alexander de Moray, Lord
of Coulbyn
; Hugh de Rose, Lord of Kilravock
; Adam Flemyng, Ingeramus de
Wenton, Eugenius de Berkeley, Thomas de Brothy, Gilbert de
on, Thomas
de Wenton, John de la Cow
, William Lambe, Henry de Doles, and Lawrence
Blac, with many others
: Which assize thus carefully sworn to speak concerning
the truth and certainty of the premises pronounce
clearly, and
boldly declare,
that they very often saw and heard such a confirmation read in many Courts of
the
Sheriffs of the Regality of Inverness, held by Galfridus de Munbeyn, and
also by Alan de Wenton, the
Sheriffs of the Regality
of the
Sheriffdom
of
Inverness
: And
this I, Robert de Chehelme, lord
of that
Ilk, as Justiciar, by
virtue of my office, testify by means of these presents
:
In testimony of which
thing my seal, along with the seals of those who were engaged fiom among those
present at said assize, is appended in witness of the ijremises
: Given and done,

DAVID II.
1329-1370, PART FOURTH.
King David granted in 1359 to the chaplain of the Church
of the Blessed Mary certain lands at the Carse.
This deed
has been printed in " Antiquarian Notes."
It was followed
by an Instrument of Resignation of the lands by the com-
munity of Inverness, dated 4th March of the same year, and
is as follows
:
Resignation of a Piece of Land hy the Community of the Burgh of Inverness.
The burgesses and community of the burgh of Inverness, to all who shall see
or hear of these letters
; Greeting eternal in the Lord
: Know all that since the
pious sincerity of devotion has just induced the inclination of the most serene
prince our Lord David, by the grace of God illustrious King of Scots, to increase,
for the support of each chaplain performing divine worship in the Chaj)el of St
Mary's, of the foresaid burgh, the possessions of said chapel by an equal revenue,
—"We, from reverence of the excellent King, and at the special instance of our
fellow burgher, John called Scot, on the day of March next after the Feast of
the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (26th), in the churchyard of foresaid
chapel, in the year of the Lord 1359, with unanimous consent and assent of
all
of us, have by staflf and baton given up and for us and our
successors or
heii's
j)urely aad simply for ever resigned to our Lord the King foresaid all right and
claim which w^e have had or could have, or which our heirs or successors at any
time hereafter could have by any title in the said piece of land of the Gras, with
the pertinents, containing 18 acres of land, lying next
to the land of St Mary's
Parochial Church of said burgh, at the south on the one part, looking beyond
le Scathgate at the east, and extending itself
in length equally lengthwise with
the land of
St Mary aforesaid, and twixt the Cras at
the north on the other
l^art
; in which piece of land, with the pertinents, our Lord the King foresaid
has infeft the foresaid chapel
in pure and perpetual cliarity by his Chai'ter, as
in said Charter
is more
clearly contained
: Renouncing
for us, our
heirs and
successors, for
ever, and
also by these presents,
all
right,
claim, and
action
therein which we had, have, or may hereafter have, and which our heirs or
successors shall
or can
hereafter have
in the piece of land
aforesaid.
And in
case it happen that we, our heirs, or successors, do or attempt anything against
the premises or any of the premises, we oblige us and our said heirs and succes-
sors as strictly as we
are able by these presents, in one hundred pounds stg. in
name
of penalty to be paid
to the fabric of the Cathedral Church of Moray as
often as it shall happen, which God forbid, in future
; the foresaid royal Charter
and these present
letters
nevertheless
to endure by their own strength
; sub-
mitting us and them, in this event, to the coercion of the Lord Bishop of Moray,
who shall
for
the time be, and
of
his
ministers without licence
of any other
judge or power, and without allegation or pretext of any right or privilege.
In
witness of which matter we have api^ended to these presents the common seal of
our burgh foresaid.
Done and given at Inverness, the 4th day of the month of
March, and year foresaid.

as any lord

Abei'bi'othok, for which rood the said John and his heirs shall i^ay yearly, at the
feast of St Martin
in
winter,
twelve pence sterling for the illuminating of St
Katherine's aforesaid, to the Vicar who shall for the time be in the Parochial
Church of Inverness
: To be held and had by him and his heirs for ever of us
and our successors, freely, quietly, and honourably, with all their pertinents, in
pure and perpetual charity
:
Paying therefor, he
and
his heirs yearly to one
chaplain
performing
divine
worship

in
said
Church, one hundred
shillings
sterling at two terms in the year—namely, one half at the Feast of
Pentecost, and the other half at the Feast of St Martin, in the winter
:
But if it
happens, which God forbid, that the said John Scot or his heirs fail in payment
of said money within twenty days after the
lajjse of any of the above written
terms, he and they shall give for every week during which they shall refrain
fi'om payment of said money, two shillings
sterling,
in name of penalty to be
converted to the use of lighting the Holy Cross of the Cathedral Church of the

all and sundry the premises

its own
strength, and they
have submitted themselves
to the
jurisdiction of the Bishop cf Moray and his official who may for the time be that
they or any of them may strictly compel them to observe all the premises by all
manner of ecclesiastical censure

as often as
it
shall happen that the foresaid Church is vacant, they may present a fit chai)lain
to us and our successors for said Chapel

In a parliament held at Perth, 18th February 1369, it is
jrecommended that the King and his Court go occasionally
into the Highlands and burden them with
the expenses of
sustenance, and
so
relieve
to some
extent
the Lowlands, 1~
'Already heavily burdened.
The lands
specially mentioned
are— ^' Kynthir, Knapdale, Arayne, the dominions
of John
of the Isles, John
of Lome, and
Gillaspic Cambel."
The
Lord of the Isles proving very troublesome, the king came
in person
to
Inverness, and
his expedition was successful^
inasmuch as John, Lord of the Isles, made a complete sub-
"'
jpiission.
The instrument
taken on
the
occasion
is
here
given, dated on the 15th of November 1369
:
To all who may see the ]3resent letters,— John de Yle, Lord of the Isles, wishes
salvation in the
Saviou.r of
all
:
Since my most serene prince and master, the
revered lord David, by the grace
of God,
illustrious King
of Scots, has been
stirred up against my i^erson because
of certain
faults committed by me, for
which reason, coming humbly to the presence of my said lord, at the Town of
Inverness, on the 15th day
of the month
of November, in the year
of
grace

1
70
INVERNESSIANA.
1369, in the
presence
of the
pi-elates, and
of vei-y many
of the nobles
of his
kingdom, I offered and submitted myself to the pleasure and favour of my said
master, by suppliantly entreating
for favour and for the remission of my
late
'
faults, and
since my
said
lord,
at the instance of his
council, has graciously
admitted me
to
his goodwill and favour, granting besides
that
I may remain
in (all) my possessions whatsoever and not be removed, except according to the
process and demand of law
:
Let it be clearly jDatent to you all, by the tenor of
these presviuts, that I, John de Yle, foresaid, promise and covenant, in good faith,
that I
shall give and make reparation
to
all good men of this kingdom what-
soever for such injuries,
losses, and troubles as have been wrought by me, my
sons, or others whose names are niore
fully
set
forth
in the royal
letters of
remission
granted to me, and to whomsoever
of the kingdom as
are faithful
I
shall thus far make the- satisfaction
conchxded
for,
and
I
shall
justly
note
purchased lands and
superiorities,
and
I
shall govern them
according to my
ability
; I shall promptly cause my sons and my subjects, and others my adherents,
to be in peaceable subjection, and that due justice shall be done to our lord the
King, and
to
the laws and customs
of
his kingdom, and that they shall be
obedient to, and shall appear before the
justiciars, sheriffs, coroners, and other
royal servants, in each sheriffdom, even better and more obediently than in the
time of Robert of good memory the predecessor of my lord the King, and as the
inhabitants of the
said lands and
superiorities have been accustomed
to
do.
They
shall answer both promptly and
dutifully to the
royal
servants what is
imposed regarding
contributions and other burdens and services due, and also
for the time past, and in the event that within the
said lands or superiorities
any person or persons shall offend against the King, or one or more of his faithful
servants, and if he or they shall despise to obey the law, or if he or they shall be
unwilling
to
obey in
the i)remises, and
in any one
of the
premises,
I
shall
immediately, entirely laying aside stratagem and deceit, jiursue that person or
those persons as enemies, and as rebels of the King and Kingdom, with all my
ability, until he
or they shall be expelled from the
limits
of
the lands and
superiorities, or I shall make him or them obey the common law
; And for per-
forming, implementing, and faithfully
observing these things, all and
each, I
personally have taken the oath in j)resence of the foresaid prelates and
nobles,
and
besides
I have
given and
surrendered
the under written
hostages,
viz.,
Donald my son, begotten
of the daughter of the Lord Seneschal
of
Scotland,
Angus, son
of my late
son John, and one Donald, another and natural son of
mine, whom,
because
at the time of the completion
of
this
present
deed,
I
have not, at
presence, ready and prepared, I shall cause them
to go into, or
to
be given up at
the Castle of Dumbarton, at
the feast of our Lord's birth now
next to come,
if
I
shall be able
otherwise on
this
side, or at the feast
of the
purification of the Blessed Virgin
(or Candlemas, 2d February) next following
thereafter, under jjain of the
breach of the oath given, and under pain
of the
loss
of
all things which with regard
to the
lord
our King, I shall be
liable
to lose, in whatever manner
; And for securing the entrance of these hostages as
promised,
I
have
found my Lord Seneschal
of
Scotland, Earl
of
Strathern,
security, whose seal
for the purpose
of the present
security, and
also for the
greater evidence of the matter is appended, along with my own proper seal, to
these presents in testimony of the premises.
Acted and given, year, day, and
place foresaid.
While
at Inverness the King on the 16 th. of November
gave to his beloved and faithful cousin John de Inverpeffer,
the office of Sheriff of Banff.
At Inverness on the 8th of November a charter was granted
by Walter Leslie, Lord of Filorth, to John de Urquhart, son
of Adam de Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty.

ROBERT II.
1370-1390. PART FIRST.
The first of the Stuart Kings succeeded to a difficult and
anxious position.
The state of the Highlands, and particu-
larly
the
Islands,
was
as
regards "the
throne
chronically
critical.
When ^le' power of the Lords of the Isles was at
length extinguished, another family, crafty, subtle, insidious,
ever
hypocritically clothed with
the
cloak of religion as a
mask to hide their real objects of aggrandisement, arose, the
cause of misery to their neighbours, of discontent between
Crown and subject, and of civil warfare within the kingdom.
^' Fause as a Campbell" has been
for centuries
proverbial,
and it has been
mischievously
said
in
explanation of
this
alleged peculiarity that
it was derived from their ancestor,
the knight with the crooked or wry mouth, who was unable
to sj)ea7c straight or on the square.
The knight having in con-
sequence, and
by
the
circumventing
of
his
neighbours,
prospered greatly, his descendants followed his example.
The King appears
to have come to Inverness
early in his
reign, for in a petition by William Earl of Ross, dated 24th
June 1371, he says
'' then when my Lord the King came to
the town of Inverness, he found me without any land
or
Lordship, my whole Earldom of Ross seized and recognosced
in his hands," &c.
Reference was formerly made
to
the questions between
the Church of Aberbrothoc which had received
a grant of
the Church
of Inverness from William
the
Lion, and
the
vicar,
regarding
the
tithes
of
Inverness.
We now
give
Appeal
to
the
Apostolic
See
for
the Abbot
against
the
Bishop
of Moray.
The document though
verbose
is
in-
teresting, and brings up vividly the procedure in Ecclesias-
tical
Courts
Rve
hundred
years
ago.
The
document
is
entitled " Appeal
to the Pope on
the part of the Abbot of
Aberbrothoc, against the process before the Bishop regard-
ing
the
tithes
of
the
Church
of
Inverness"—and
is
as
follows
:—
In the name of God, Amen.
By this
present
public instrument
let
it

clearly known
to
all men

:
In presence of me notary public, and of the subscribed
witnesses,
the discreet man Andrew Ox, rector of the Church of Inverarity, in the diocese
of St Andrews, personally appointed procurator of the reverend men the Lords

72
INVERNESSIANA.
Abbot and Convent, of the Monastry of Aberbrothoc in the diocese of St Andrews,
held
in
his hand a paper schedule, written apparently wholly on the one
side,
and read it word for word, of which schedule the tenor follows in this form
:
In the name of God, Amen, since the remedy of appeal or challenge is advan-
tageously found to be the refuge of the oppressed, or in truth of those who fear
that they are by law
oppressed, hence it
is that
as you Reverend Father and
Lord,
Lord
Alexander by the Grace
of God Bishop
of Moray,
lately at the
Monastery of Scone in the diocese of St Andrews, at the Coronation of our Lord
King Robert now reigning, did
verbally intimate
to
the venerable
father in
Christ Lord John, Abbot
of Aberbrothoc, in
said diocese of St Andrews, that
at the instance of Master Eustachius, vicar of
Inverness, in your
diocese you
ordered a process against him regarding certain tithes of said Church, and when
the said Abbot demanded of you with instance a copy of
it, and said he had
not heard of this before, you rej^lied that he
should go down himself or by a
procurator to the parts of your diocese of Moray, where you had sent the process,
and that you would give him
there without
difficulty the copy he sought
:
Whereupon the said Abbot being quite satisfied, and while engaged with other
matters connected with his monastery, sent specially to your presence in Moray,
the
discreet men Lord James Eraser, Knight, and Alexander Skirmechour,
as
procurators for himself and his Convent, with full power to obtain-said copy for
the purpose of considering said i^rocess, whether it would do him good or harm
;
and the said James and Alexander then frequently and
urge'ntly sought the
premises
to be delivered
to them
by you, or that
a day and
place be assigned
them for the exhibition of that x^rocess,
in order that they might get an oppor-
tunity of copying and transcribing
it
:
You expressly answered that you then
had no time to implement the premises sought, and knew not of another day or
place to assign
:
Whereupon Lord James and Alexander, perceiving the foresaid
abbot and convent to be oppressed in
this matter contrary to justice, j)rotested
by appealling, and worn out with weariness by you during many diets, and after
heavy labour and expense, they returned to their distant Lord with the business
unaccomplished
:
Whence
the
abbot,
wishing
to guard
against
loss
to
his
monastery, and thinking to engage your benevolence by many fervent requests,
has sent me, Andrew Ox, as his procurator, with full power to seek and receive
a copy of
foresaid process, and
to do
the other
things that may be needful or
suitable for the indemnity of foresaid monastery
; and though I have often and
diligently asked
for the
copy,
you,
however, have been unwilling to
give
it
;
Wherefore, for thesa and other reasons
to be set forth at
fit time and place,
I,
Andrew, procurator foresaid, of the abbot and convent, and in my ijrocuratorial
character, carefully bearing in mind that you favour too much the opposite party,
and strive to suppress the right of the abbot and convent, as you refuse to give
a copy of foresaid process, which you ought to give, and do not grant an oppor-
tunity for transcribing it, appeal in this writ from you, Loid Alexander, Bishop
of Moray, and from your foresaid process, which
is, as
I
susjDect, irregular and
inept
unless
it be framed
of new, since you dare not bring
it
to
light, and
summon you to the Holy Apostolic See, and thereafter demand most urgently
of the apostles that it be exhibited to me
: And I place the abbot, convent, and
monastery foresaid, and
all their
followers, or
those who
desire
to adhere to
them, and their whole goods moveable and unmoveable, under the care, defence,
and protection
of the
aforesaid Apostolic
See
:
And do not you, Alexander,
Lord Bishop, and
let no one deputed by you, in anywise proceed against said
abbot and convent by means of suspension, excommunication,
sequestration of
fruits,
or by sentences
of
interdict,
since you
are the open
enemy
of
said
monastery
and monks,
by your
having
otherwise
rashly
deprived them
of
thirty-five pounds sterling of the fruits of their church of Abirkerthor contrary
to God
and
justice and the apostolic favours granted to the monastery, which
they intend to prove where above set forth
:
For this injury I personally also
summon you
in
their name to the said Apostolic See
: Protesting in name as
above to improve,
correct, amend
this
appeal, and add
to and take from the
same according as to my foresaid lords and their
council shall seem expedient
:
Let not
therefore your
process, in this manner hid under a bushel, do hurt to
the foresaid abbot and convent or their monastery
:
If by means of it you shall
perchance proceed justly or unjustly to enter into possession of goods moveable
or unmoveable, which, however, you ought not to do against those not lawfully
cited, I
offer
you caution in my character of procurator both for the recovery
of
said possession and the interrui)ting of the annual
prescription, and
I am
ready by
waiting, to
abide the law and
to do those things which have to be
done by law in
such case for the recovery of like possession
:
If, however, you
shall
perchance proceed
to
a
definite
sentence, which
to hear
of
would
l>o

INVERNESSIANA.
,
73
sufficiently absurd, as you will not
be able
to decide anything against a party
unheard, and a sentence by the law
itself does not
hold, when the edict of
citation comes not to the knowledge of the party.
Though the sentence may by
the very law be
entirely null, however,
I appeal from
it and summon you in
this writ seeking the Apostles most urgently as above, whom if you deny I again
appeal and summon as above, protesting by the powerful name of said Abbot and
Convent that they do not intend, because of
this appeal, to depart from other
appeals previously interponed by them, but using the same they also purpose,
as occasion shall demand, to assist themselves by means of the former.
After
the reading of
this apjieal, I was urgently required by the said Lord Andrew,
procurator foresaid to furnish him with a public instrument on the above written
appeal and to reduce
the same as
interponed,
into
.a public form and sign it
with my usual sign, he, however, paying all outlays and expenses.
This appeal
was acted, read, interponed, and published in the Cathedral Church of Elgin in
Moray on the above named year, day, month, indiction and
pontificate, there
being present the venerable and
discreet men Master William
de
Chesholme,
Treasurer of Moray, Lord John Bell, Eector of the Church of Kyngorn in the
diocese of St Andrews,
Lords John de Flandris, John de
Tarres,
chaplains
;
Andrew de Feltoun, Thomas Glaswrycht, John Aurifabro,* laymen, and many
other witnesses to the premises specially called and required in presence of me
the foresaid Lord.,
And I, AYilliam Leweryk^, clerk of the diocese
of Brechin, by apostolic and
imjjerial authority, notary public in the premises, was present and engaged at
the reading of said schedule, and also at the interposition and publication of the
present appeal, together with the before-named
witnesses, and by reducing, I
have written said appeal into this public form with my hand, and on foresaid
appeal and its contents, I have by the
special request of the said Lord Andrew
as procurator, made this public instrument, and being required and asked,
I
have signed it with my usual sign to the faith and testimony of the premises.
The Bishop's reply
will be given
in our
next.
It
is of
great length, very amusing, and shows Bishop Alexander to
have been an adept with the pen.

ROBERT
II.
1370-1390.
PART SECOND
The Bishop's letter or answer to the appeal of the Abbot
of Aberbrothock is now given.
He had more scope than the
Abbot, who was obliged to confine himself to a dry narrative,
and took full advantage of the liberty, just as showy lawyers
were wont
to do in the irreclaiming petitions and answers,
when such were permitted.
The Bishop
incisively declares
" that the churches of said monks, their necessarv manor
places and houses are desolate, in ruins and destroyed.
The
churches themselves even
are without their necessary orna-
ments, divine offices and sacraments, and, as it were, quite
j destitute.
•
The
vicars
are
complaining,
the
parishioners
[grumbling, not without grave scandal and strong
cry, and
* The terms Glaswrycht and Aurifabro point to the occupations of thiese individuals,
^the fermer-being a glazier and the latter a goldsmith.
K

74
INVERNESSIANA.
the danger of souls, and many heavy and enormous
daily
open sins which cannot be set forth shortly with the pen."
The
Bishop
also
complains
of the
violent
proceedings
taken in name of the Abbot against the church and town of
Inverness, " by powerful laymen whose power and ferocity
could not in any way be resisted—as, for instance, the noble
and a man of great power—W.
de
F.," probably William
de Fentoun,
or William de Foderingham, who broke into
the Vicar's house,
threatened
his
life,
&c.,
as graphically
detailed in the answer.
^.
The town and churches of Inverness must have suffered
/
greatly, for the Bishop goes on
to relate piteously, "As in
the
foresaid
Church of Inverness, which
also
is a
noble,
strong, and distinguished
place, abounds in
fruits, and has
a concourse
of many
noble
Knights
and
other powerful
''
men, is evidently patent, so that a single garment fit for the
Abbot or a part of him, and
so that a small missal which
^
may be worth two pence will not be found therein, let alone
for me when
performing my
yearly
visitations
to reform
foresaid
defects, and for the covering and protecting of
it,
whose roof does not in any degree shelter either the greater
altar,
or
the wardrobe
from
being
befouled,
nay
rather
jumbled together by the rains as often as they fall."
'
The above clearly shows the importance both in strength
and residency of Inverness
at
this period.
The monastery
suffered probably at the same time, for it will be recollected
that in the Court held by Sir Robert de Chisholm
in 1376
reference was made to the destruction by fire previously of a
charter which lay for presumed greater safety in the house
of the Preaching Friars of Inverness.
^
Follows the Bishop's Letter to Pope Gregory
:
^tW. flMV^ '7^"
-^^ ^^^® most Holy Father in Christ, Lord Gregory, by divine providence, chief
pontiff
of the Sacred Roman and Universal Church,
his humble and devout
suppliant, Alexander, Bishop
of Moray, in Scotland, with recommendation of
the petitioner's kisses for the feet of the blessed
: Most holy Father and Lord,
not only from clear indications, but also from experience of the matter itself, it
evidently appears and can be gathered that monks dead to the world by reason
of
their vow, serve the world at the present time more frequently and with an
abject show both
of obedience and poverty,
over- abounding in wealth, they
wantonly busy themselves in provoking
revolts
against their
superiors.
The
churches of said monks, their necessary manor
j)laces and houses are desolate,
in rviins and destroyed.
The churches themselves even are without their neces-
sary ornaments, divine
offices and sacraments, and
as
it were quite destitute.
The
vicars
are
complaining,
the
parishioners
grumbling,
not without
grave
scandal, and strong cry, and the danger of souls, and many heavy and enormous
daily open
sins which cannot be
set forth
shortly with the pen.
"When the
ordinaries of the places, as they are bound, i)roceed to the reformation of these
defects, and come desiring to fulfil the usual duty
of
visitation, immediately
these monks presume arrogantly, and impudently, and busy themselves against
said
ordinaries by flocking together
for
their dispersion by appeal, so that it
happens once and again that defects of this nature, destruction and heavy losses
are i^assed over and remain uncorrected through the malicious impudence of the
monks themselves.
There came lately to me one Andrew Ox, presbyter of the

INVERNESSIANA.
75
diocese of St Andrews, as procurator, as he asserted, and with
procuratorial
functions on behalf of the abbot and convent of the monastery of Aberbrothoc,
of the order of St Benedict, in the foresaid diocese of St Andrews, who hokl in
my diocese of Moray two parish churches, viz., of
Inverness and
Abei'kerdor,
and the rectors or parsons of these churches are invoked.
He exhibited to me
in the Cathedral Church of Moray a certain wi'it of appeal, if so it may or can
be termed, very contemptuously and
ii-reverently, as
is
clear
in
said
writ, in
name and on the part of said Abbot and monks, and in it he has appealed from
lue and summoned me to the Apostolic See, pretending and alleging the following
frivolous and gi'oundless reasons
:—First, for instance, he says in many confused
words that I have oppressed the foresaid Abbot and monks, inasmuch as that I
denied to said Abbot or his procurators a copy of a
certain j)rocess in a certain
case of tithes that had been moved 'twixt the abbot and the vicar of Inverness,
and
is now pending and held
before me, for which hardship he appeals, &c.,
which assuredly is not true.
The truth is, however, that while the Abbot's pro-
curators were asking a copy of the process to be given them, I replied that I had
not the process lying beside me, but they should come to the
place where the
cause was being pled, and where there were writers who had written the process
or other judicial acts, if there were any, and they would there obtain the copy
they were seeking.
Now the copy of notaries is not given in every place to those
who ask
for
it, and there is not everywhere notaries of court or sworn scribes,
who write
judicial
transactions, and in whose keeping these remain, inasmuch
as they are kept elsewhere, but at one time one, and at another another, who
may be had with most readiness,
write such transactions
; and
so, because
of
the want of notaries, when such judicial proceedings perish, it is not from any
fault on the part of the judge, and I am not obliged, as I think, to preserve that
process, if there was any, always and everywhere in readiness in a bag, to be
exhibited on every occasion
And, further, they contumaciously and
with contempt spurned and refused to consider the matter, or even to listen.
The
truth itself, however, is my witness, that
I never of my own
accord, or from
design or through malice, was silent or denied to said abbot or his procurators
the process, or a copy of
it, or in any way proceeded against him, in as far as I
was able, to injure or hurt in any manner his right or cause.
In addition, how-
ever, he
inserts that he
appeals from me and my irregular
process,
and in
conclusion, subjoins that the edict of citation did not come to the knowledge of
the
party.
This
is utterly void
of
effect and without the shadow
of
truth.
Especially since—at the beginning of this lawsuit, when the cause was moved
there compeared at the first edict
of citation the venerable men—viz.. Master
"WilUam de Spiny and John de Bothuyll, canons of Moray, together with others,
joint procurators of said Abbot, who exhibited sufficient power of procuratory,
and at divers times and seasons proceeded with the cause and lawsuit.
There-
after, no citation had been made in the continuation of the process, since in the
church
of Inverness regarding whose fruits there was
litigation, it had been
made
public, and proclamations were then made
publicly before
the j)eople
where the Abbot had and has
his procurators always who might and could
defend him
if they wished, and also inform him regarding a process of law of
whatsoever kind, or of a cause of
strife.
Citations and proclamations of
this
kind were not wont to be made suddenly or hastily, but open and publicly, and
between the solemnities of the services
; even in the greater Church or Cathedral
where the cause was being handled they were madu
public during the space of
forty days and thereafter of eight weeks.
And I am not, the Most High willing,
bound to transmit to another diocese mandates, edicts, or citations.
His duty
it was who was informed, or ought to be, not to desert the cause when initiated
or begun in mockery of law, the judge and the party, but
to continue
it even
unto the end.
From
these it
is clearly gathered that he is and has not been
ignorant that this process or any particle of
it was instituted and held, nor can
he say with a safe conscience that the party was not cited and that it came not
under his notice.
Nay, rather does it seem more likely that by aijpealing, since
he has maliciously and knowingly neglected
to observe the term
of
appeal
appointed by law, he does not and by law will not be able to j)reserve the force
and form of appeal by a pretext of
this
sort.
In the second
place, he goes on
to call me the open enemy of said Abbot, monks, and monastery, attaching and
specifying a cause—to
wit, that
I have
spoiled them
of
thirty-five
ahilUngsL. ;^^^v»-**'-8t^
sterling from their Church of Aberkerdor.
But, assuredly, it
is more
certain
f
than truth, and clearer than light, that this statement is altogether destitute of
truth, and expressly contains a lie.
I disavow, deny, and repel that spoliation,
and the crime of spoliation, and all undue receipt of any money whatsoever, as such
is no part of a
j)riest's duty.
And granted
that some
trilling sum
of money

76
INVERNESSIANA.
from said Churcli
of Aberkerdor, regarding which
said Abbot complains and
murmurs, has come in my name to some one or other of my oflScers, which I,
however, do
not
admit, nor believe
to be
true,
it,
however, had never been
held or received with the intention, purpose, or form of spoiling, or otherwise
doing injury in any measure whatever, which God forbid.
And even
if any-
thing has been received in my name, by reason and form of ordinary justice, and
in the accustomed mode and order, I have always offered and offer that
I shall
answer for the debt in the i^resence of any good man whatsoever, within or with-
out the diocese.
Thus, I altogether deny, rejDel, and entirely exclude spoliation,
and all action or pretended case of spoliation.
But since the Abbot fictitiously,
maliciously, and falsely treats of and opposes against me an accusation or crime
of spoliation, certainly it can deservedly and really be objected against him as
opponent, and I object what he accuses me of, both of the crime of spoliation in
this affair, and the express and violent invasion of
ecclesiastical freedom and
immunity, and it can be well and effectively argued, and notably and with pro-
bability reprehended, especially since said Abbot is aglow with the flame of spite
and the
desire
of
revenge, and not inspired with zeal for justice.
After the
cause 'twixt himself and the foresaid
vicar of Inverness had been moved and
begun, spurning, omitting, and even altogether contemning the path of ordinary
law, in contempt, disobedience, and irreverence
of my ordinary jurisdiction
nay, rather more truly for the Apostolic See, under whose special protection
my foresaid Church of Moray
lives—with
sure
knowledge, malicious design,
and with intention of obtaining a worthless revenge, he placed, appointed, and
caused to be
placed and appointed
at
said Church and town
of
Inverness,
powerful laymen, whose power and ferocity could not in any way be resisted,
as, for instance, the noble and a man of great power, W. de F., who in name
and on the part of said Abbot, with an armed and great host, violently entered
the houses of the foresaid vicar, broke and
caused to be broken lockfast places
and doors, destroying, plundering, and even carrying away with him
into his
den the victuals and various other things found there, and in divers ways doing
injury to the person and friends of said vicar.
He also threatened the vicar
himself with death, so that he durst not enter his own house or appear anywhere
in the town, but was compelled to lie hid within the Church until security through
the pressing instance and intervention or intercession of many good men had been
accepted by the foresaid potentate in his
behalf.
And the foresaid nobleman
was wont
to say
publicly,
openly,
and unreservedly,
that
he
on
the
part,
authority, and with the consent and by the bidding of said Abbot, had altogether
so acted and not otherwise.
Experience and the series of transactions argue the
express
and
infallible
truth
of
the
fact—nay,
rather
they
expressly
and
efficaciously prove it.
For it is evident that
it was not
before the commence-
ment
of
that
case
or lawsuit, but after,
and
before the commission of that
violence, and also from the time thereof, since and after, and even continuously
up
to the
present
time,
the
foresaid
noble and
powerful procru-ator of said
Abbot had been appointed, and by name specially included,
in whatsoever his
letters or procuratories for the administration
of
all the fruits of the foresaid
Church of Inverness solely by reason of this case, and wholly to obtain and dis-
pose thereof according
to the pleasure
of
his
will.
From which
it may be
clearly concluded that not only had he been appointed to commit the foresaid
violence, yea, rather to make use of the same for absorbing and taking away the
right of the party and of the ordinary jurisdiction, bat also griituitously with
the most malignant and wanton design on the part of foresaid Abbot.
And he
is not content with that malice or wickedness of his, for over all his churches or
quasi churches he has also appointed powerful laymen who spoil and deprive his
poor vicars of the pensions due them, or of some particles thereof, and hence-
forth they
can
but
sj)end a wretched
life.
These also
oi^jiress the common
people.
They deprive churches and souls of the accustomed services to such
a degree that because of the power of such seculars the ordinaries are not
able,
even with the common ornaments, to do in their churches as is provided for, as
in the
foresaid Church
of
Inverness,
which
also
is a noble,
strong, and
dis-
tinguished
place,
and abounds
in
fruits, and has a concourse of many noble
knights and other powerful men, is evidently patent,
so that a
single garment
fit for the Abbot, or a part
of him, and so that a small missal which may be
worth twopence will not be found therein, let alone for me when performing my
yearly visitations to foresaid church, for the reforming of foresaid defects, and
for covering and protecting it, whose roof does not in any degree shelter either
the
greater
altar or the wardrobe from being befouled or rather jumbled to-
gether by the rains as often as they fall.
For this foresaid violent and foolish
deed of spoliation and invasion, if sentence of excommunication had been passed

INVERNESSIANA.
77
both by canonical statute and by that of the Provincial Assembly, there
is no
doubt it has fallen upon said Abbot who commanded and authorised, and after
the fact ratified it
: And I have pronounced that sentence of excommunication
against him and declare him unlosed therefrom.
However, as lawsuits may be
everlasting, and should be put an end to, and I always would desire to embrace
those things which pertain to peace, and let
it
be my good fortune
to
fear a
fault where there is none, though I do not believe that the foresaid Abbot has
injured me in any way, however, incontinent after this appeal was issued and
intimated, I fixed a
certain term
for the
said Abbot
in writs signed with my
seal, and openly and publicly affixed upon the doors of the Church,
to wit the
last day of the month of August in the Cathedral of Moray, to instruct regard-
ing the alleged grievance if he should please, and to hear the revocation of
said
gi'ievance,
if I have done anything or if aught has been done on my behalf, and
to consider then what had been done.
At which day and place the Abbot though
long expected,
and being often and publicly summoned, came not, either com-
pearing by himself or by a procurator,
I caused revocation
of this grievance,
if perchance
I have
inflicted
any, to be made by word and in writing, and I
revoked and do revoke it with effect.
Accordingly, certain letters of citation of
said
process being exhibited and
there
read,
set forth and published, which
casually and not without diligence
I had found with the writers, I have given
command publicly that wherever they had found or knew where to find this
process or any part thereof, greater or less which can belong by right thereto,
they should give up and exhibit to said Abbot or his procurator a copy without
show of difficulty under pain of excommunication as in a certain public instru-
ment made regarding this
is more clearly and specifically contained.
And
it
was because of my having denied, as he falsely asserted, a copy of this process
that he at first and principally appealed.
By this revocation,
so efficaciously
and lawfully made, it is evident that jurisdiction has been reserved to me to
proceed in said cause,
jvist as
if this
aj)peal had not been interposed.
Since,
therefore, an appeal may not be a chain of injustice, but rather a protection for
the
innocent and
oppressed, men should not have recourse from justice and
judge to frivolous appeal.
As for this frivolous, malicious, and fictitious appeal,
which as it is clearer than light, however that the term thereof appointed by
law had completely elapsed,
it contains not nor can contain the
force, form,
or
effect of an appeal.
I have not, nor do I wish to accuse it, nor have I caused it
to
be accused,
because
of the
feigned, malicious,
unti^uthful, and unavailing
reasons
therein
inserted,
as the
accusation
of
it,
if
so made, would redound
beyond doubt to the great loss and prejudice of churches, the cure of
souls, and
even the persons of men, which cannot be tolerated, as we must not indu.lge in
evils, both justice and the order of law persuading otherwise.
After having
also had in this matter the frequent and attentive advice of skilled i)ersons,
I
have repelled and refused, do repel and refuse the reasons of appeal, as contrary
to law and reason, and as informal,
useless, and unavailing, and I have caused
and decreed them to be repelled and refused, reserving this matter and business
as before in all things to my authority and ordinary jurisdiction, saving always
the reverence due to the Holy Apostolic See.
And I have
caused to be given,
and give these my letters patent, annexed to said frivolous appeal, under my seal
to said Abbot or his procurator in behalf of the apostles refutatory, and in room
thereof if they ought so
to be styled, and
I transmit it and said letters to be
presented to your Holiness.
In testimony
whereof
to
these
presents for the
apostles' refutatory, as is above set forth, my
seal
is appended, together with
the subscription and sign of the within written Notary.

ROBERT II.
1370-1390,
PART THIRD.
Katharine de
Spencer, daughter and heiress of the late
/Henry
de
Spencer,
with
consent
of John
Fulirwith, her
\J husband, grants to John, called Bosse, burgess of Inverness,
a yearly rent of two
shillings
upliftable furth of the tene-
ment on the
east
side of the Church
Street of Inverness,
belonging to the heirs of the late Alexander de Marre.
The
seal of Gilbert Waus, burgess of Inverness, and that of the
community of the burgh of Inverness, are attached as
^' she
had at present no proper
seal of her own."
The witnesses
are John de Kynkarne, Provost
; Thomas
son
of Henry,
Thomas son of Donald, and Thomas Pollock, bailies
;
Bar-
tholomew son of William, John Scott, Symon
Pistor, John
Ruary,
Grillespic, Richard
son
of David,
William Waus,
Ralph de Chapman, Michael Rechy, Walter son of William,
Michael Reid, Thomas son of John, Thomas son of Patrick,
Thomas Cuthbert, at that time clerk of the community, with
many others.
It
will be
noticed liow
very common
the
name Thomas was, and that all the names with one or two
exceptions are Lowland.
In 1379, the King granted to his son, the Wolf of Bade-
noch, certain lands
within
the Sheriffdom
of Inverness on
which
the
feu was
payable
at
Inverness.
The name
of
Minigaig is now hardly kijown, but it included a section
of
the Grampian range, watered
to the north by the numerous
sources
of
the
river
Tromie.
The
person
forfeited
was
obviously
a Comyn,
and
that
connection
is
five
hundred
years after
still retained, for we find that the pass
leading
into Athole by Gaick
river, and
its
feeder
the water
of
Gairbh Gaick,
is
still known as Rathaid nan-Cuimeinach.
The other names Rene and Cragy were probably portions of
Minigaig.
The Charter is as follows
:
Robert by the Grace of God,
&c., to all good men of his whole realm, cleric
and laic
; Greeting
: Know that we have given, granted, and by this our present
charter
confirmed,
to our beloved
son Alexander
Senescall, knight, Lord
of
Badenoch, the lands of Minigge (Minigaig), Rene, and Cragy, with the pertinents
within the Sheriffdom of Inverness, which belong to us by reason of the escheat
of William son of Walter
: To be held and had by the said Alexander and his
heirs and
assignees of us and our heirs in feu and
heritage, by all their right
marches and divisions, with
all and sundry liberties,
commodities, easements,
and their just pertinents whatsoever belonging to said lands, or which in future
can
in any way justly belong, freely, quietly,
fully, wholly, and honourably
:
Giving therefor
to us and our
heirs,
the
said Alexander and
his
heirs and
assignees annually, one penny silver in name of feu farm at Inverness
if asked
only, in lieu
of all other secular service, exactipn, or demand
:
In testimony of

INVERNESSIANA.
79
which
thing, to this our present charter we have commanded our
seal to be
appended
: These being witnesses—the venerable fathers in Christ, William and
John, our chancellor. Bishops of the Churches of St Andrews and Dunkeld
; John
de Carrie, our first-born Senescall of Scotland
; Robert de Fyff and de Menteth,
our son
; our beloved cousin William de Douglas and de Marr, Earls
; our beloved
nephew James de
Lyndesay,
and
our cousin
Alexander
de
Lyndesay.
At
Methven, the 18th day of the month of Octobei', the 9th year of our reign.—1379.
Upon
the
20th
of March
1379,
the King granted the
following charter of subjects in Church
Street and Gordon
Terrace, Inverness, to Robert de Appleton
:
Robert, by the Grace
of God, King of Scots,
to
all the good men
of
all
his realm, cleric and
laic
; Greeting
: Know that we have given, granted, and
by this our present charter confirmed, to our beloved and
faithful Robert de
Appylton, a certain passage within our Burgh of Invirnyss, lying in the street
which
is
called
le Kyrkgate (Church Street), on the south
side
of said
street,
'twixt the land
of said Robert on the east side on the one part, and the land of
Stephen de Camera on the west on
the other, together with a
certain
part of
our Castle-hill of Invirnyss,
extending
in length from the edifice of William
Pilche, Knight, even to the water of Nyss, and in breadth from the end of the
edifice of the said Robert up to the wall
of our foresaid Castle
: To be held
and had bj' the said Robert and his heirs, of us and our heirs, in feu and heritage,
throughout
all
their right meiths and marches, with all and sundry
liberties,
commodities,
easements,
and
just
pertinents
whatsoever
belonging to
said
passage, with the portion of Castle-hill foresaid, or which may in any way in
future belong, freely, quietly, and in peace
; Giving therefor yearly to us and our
heirs, the said Robert and
his
heirs three silver pennies
: In witness of which
thing, &c.
At Dundee, the 20th day of March, in the year of our reign the 8th.
For the witnesses we
are referred
to
a
previous
entry.
Unfortunately, we know not which
to select, as
the entries
are not always according to date.
The name " Robert de Appleton" appears in several deeds
about this time, which circumstance
indicates that he was
evidently a man of some position in Inverness or
its neigh-
bourhood.
In 1380
the King was
at Inverness, and on the 11th of
August confirmed
a
charter by Adam
Pingile, burgess of
Aberdeen, in favour of Grod, the blessed Virgin Mary, all the
holy angels, and to a chaplain to perform divine worship for
ever
in the Cathedral Church of Aberdeen, of the lands of
Folethrowle, in the barony of Kynedward, and sheriffdom of
Aberdeen.
The feuds between the Wolf of Badenoch and the See of
Moray are well known, but the following declaration under
the hands
of a notary, dated 11th October
1380,
gives a
minute account of certain disputes which for the time were
settled amicably.
The
subject of dispute appears
to have
come in part before the king when he was at Inverness in
August, and while dispensing justice
in the church of St
Mary's, before a numerous and influential assemblage.
The
declaration
to the
effect
that " the lands of the Bishop of
Moray in Badenoch are not held of the Lord of Badenoch"
is as follows
:

80
INVERNESSIANA.
In the name
of God, Amen
:
Let
all present as well as future know that
in the year of the Lord 1380, in the third
indiction, on the 11th day of the
month
of October, in the second year
of
the pontificate of Lord Clement, by
divine providence Pope, the seventh
of that name, and in the
tenth year of
the
reign
of the
excellent
prince,
Lord Robert the
Seneschall, by the
like
providence King of Scots, second
of
the name reigning
in Scotland, while the
illustrious man. Lord Alexander the Seneschall, Lord of Badenoch, son of our
said Lord Robert, and his lieutenant in the northern parts of the kingdom was
holding his court at
" the Standing Stones" of Easter Kingussie, in Badenoch,
in the
diocese
of Moray, and while he was sitting as Lord, amid
his vassals and
subjects, for the distribution of justice as was reported, and there were standing
by his
tribunal the noblemen William de Camera, justiciary clerk of our Lord
the King, and secretary and seal-bearer of the said Lord Alexander, the
Lords
Alexander Man, and Martin de Caldor, archdeacon and chancellor of the Church
of Ross, Robert
de Apyltoun, burgess
of Inverness, and other free-tenants
of
Badenoch, and
others who owed
suit, following, compearance,
or the
service
attached to the Court of the Regality of Badenoch, and who were cited by John
Gray,
a layman, mair
of Badenoch, for
said day and
i)lace by command, by
means
of
the letters of the said Lord Alexander, whereof the tenor word for
word follows, and
is
to
this
effect
:—Alexander Seneschall, Lord of Badenoch
to our beloved John Gray
; Greeting
: Know that we have granted you
i\i\l
power to
cite
all and sundry tenants who hold any land within the marches of
our Regality of Badenoch, by giving you
special mandate by these presents in
the i^remises, and by having regard to whatsoever you shall cause to be lawfully
done as to the foresaids
: Wherefore, for your strictly understanding, we command
you to cite the reverend father in Christ, Lord Alexander, by the grace of God,
Bishop of Moray at Logachnacheny,* in a lavpful place, and distinctly by himself
at Ardinche,f also at the Church land of Kingussie, at the land of the Chapel
of Rate,J at the land of the Chapel of Nachtan,§ at the land
of
the Bishop of
Kyncardyn, and at any and every j)lace, and by divers witnesses
; also at the land
of GartinenagallylT holding of him, at Kyncardyn holding of him
: that they com-
pear before us at the Standand Stanys of Rathe of Kyngucy Easter, on the 10th
day of the month of October next to come, to show us by what evidents they
claim to hold
said lands within the bounds of our Regality foresaid, there to
do what the order of law
shall demand, and be thou there,
having with thee
these our
letters
and the testimony of thy citation,
according to the tenor of
this our command
:
In testimony of which matter, to these
presents we have
commanded our
seal to be appended at the Castle of Ruthven, the 14th day of
the month of
July, in the year of the Lord 1380
:—The foresaids
thereafter
compearing, suits are then called, and according to custom the court is fenced.
The reverend father in Christ, Alexander, by the grace of God, Bishop of Moray,
accompanied by a becoming retinue, directed his steps to the Court, and standing
without
the Court,
after
silence had been
obtained,
modestly
offered what
follows, speaking thus—Protestation being premised that because of
this com-
pearance
or any other
things we
shall say or
do here, we
do
not mean to
acknowledge you illustrious man. Lord Alexander Seneschall, Lord of Badenoch,
as Lord
Superior
of
the
lands which our Church of Moray and we hold in
Badenoch, but since
it has come to our knowledge that you, as it pleased you,
caused us to be cited in our
said lands
to this day and place, to show you how
we hold those
lands,
therefore
we
set forth for the information
of
all here
present, that we lately in
the month of August last past, in the Church
of St
Mary
of Inverness before our Lord the King and the

of Dunkeld, Chancellor
of
Scotland, John Lyonne, Chamberlain of
Scotland,
Thomas de Erskin, Hubert de Cheshelm, Knights, and many others, disclaimed
you Lord Alexander and your court, and acknowledged our Lord the King, and
now here again wc say and show that we and our Church
of Moray hold said
lands—viz., of Eatmorcus,
Logykeny,
Kingucy,
Inche, Ardinche, and
of
the
chapels of Rate and Nachtan, and the land of Kyncardyn, and of whichsoever of
these, of our Lord
the King of Scotland
; and we deny we hold these lands
or any of them of you
; and
so disclaim you and your court, and invoke and
acknowledge our Lord the King and
his court, and as regards these we seek
as
witnesses you Lord Alexander and all here standing, and thee notary that hereon
thou give us a public document.
The said Lord Alexander replied that since he
was requested he would accordingly willingly afford testimony to these matters
as they did not stand in the way.
Lord Alexander then caused the said Lord
Bishop to be called in his court to answer for said lands, the Bishop then returned
into court from which he had not gone far, and when silence was obtained, gave
pledge in the hand of the said Lord Alexander, not as Lord of Badenoch, but as
Sheriff of Inverness,
that by the force of the disclamation made, he was bound
to refrain fi'om further process against him and his Church, and from sentence,
judgment,
decreet,
recognition of said
lands, looinding, or any other mode of
distraining.
The said Lord Alexander refused
to accept of said j)ledge.
The
Lord Bishop then carried said pledge in defect of the Sheriff of Inverness, and
offered it to the said William de Camera, justiciary clerk of our Lord the King as
King's minister, and the said William also refused to accept it, and as there was
no other royal minister present, the said Lord Bishop extended said jsledge to, and
found caution in the hands of Robert de Galbrath, macer of our Lord the King,
there present, who accepted the pledge, and thereupon the said Lord Bishop
withdrew a short space from the court.
As Lord Alexander still continued the
process against him, he again returned to the court and reiterated the disclama-
tion formerly made with the pi'eceding protestation and extension of the pledges
offered by him, and which were likewise repelled by the said Lord Alexander
the Seneschall, as
Sheriff of Inverness, and by the said
justiciary clerk of our
Lord the King in
face of the court, and of Patricius de
Crautord,
Sheriff
of
Banff, who
recently had entered the court, as he said,
after the foresaid griev-
ances had been inflicted upon the said Lord Bishop, and offered, and produced
caution
in
his hand
as a minister of
the King though
of another
territory,
Patricius
also refused to receive said
i)ledge.
And as afterward
in said court
there was passed a certain judgment
or decreet
against said Lord Bishoi), for
taking sasine of foresaid lands, with the exception of the land of Rathmorcus, in
the hand of the said Lord Alexander,
the Bishop returned to
the court and
thrice warned and inhibited any servant of the said Lord Alexander from going
to said lands to seize, recognosce, or
attempt any other thing to the prejudice
of the
royal crown and regal
dignity and
jurisdiction, or to the hurt
of his
privilege, and that of the Church of Moray, under pain of
all which, as against
our Lord the King he could lose, and under the threat that he would proceed as
severely as possible by law and custom against any such invaders of ecclesiastical
matters
and
sacrilegious, and
as
j)lunderers
and
violators of the royal and
apostolic protection, by every mode of church censure and by
all other ways.
Upon
all which matters
the said
Lord
Bishop
sought of me notary
within
written a liublic instrument to be made for him, and for this called as witnesses
the said Lord Alexander and all the forementioned persons and the whole court
itself, and thereupon retired.
Now on the morrow, to wit, the 12th day of the
month and year foresaid, before noon, there were assembled together, in the Castle
of Ruthven, in Badenoch, in the diocese
of Moray, in the first instance in the
chapel, and afterward in the great chamber behind the
hall, the said reverend
father in
Christ, Lord Alexander, by the Grace
of God, Bishop of Moray, and
the said Lord Alexander the Seneschall, Lord of Badenoch
: and while they were
talking together regarding said process transacted on the day previous against said
Lord Bishop, atidof the judgment or decreet given in the court then held, and the
Bishop was
accusing Lord Alexander and
his
assessors and
advisers
of
the
iniquity, nay rather of the nullity
of that process and judgment or decreet, and
while many things were being said on both sides. Lord Alexander at length fully
informed after having i^reviously had a consultation with his council, of whom
there
were present
at
the
time, Patricius
de
Crauford, William de Camera,
Alexander Man, Martin de Caldor, and Robert de Apylton above written, and
Lord
William
de
Fodryngham,
knight, who had
just
lately come
to Lord
Alexander, by the unanimous advice
of these revoked and annulled his whole
process, and said judgment, or decreet passed, or issued in court, as incautiously
passed and
issued,
so
far
as they had proceeded from
fact,
and held it and.

INVERNESSIANA.
desired it to be held for himself and his successors, the future Lords of Badenoch,
as revoked and annulled, nay rather as none of his and not done by his judge
:
In token of which the said Lord Alexander caused the whole process with the
deci-eet
to be
torn from the roll of
that
day's court by the
said William de
Camera, his secretary and seal-bearer, and to be given to me the within written
notary to be burnt
; which process with the decreet, I the within written notary,
in presence
of
said Lords,
the Bishop and
Alexander, and of the others next
after named, by command
of Alexander
himself,
and
in
presence
of
Lords
Robert de Sancto Claro, the Dean, and Alexander of Urchard, a canon of Moray,
John Grey, vicar of Artildol
; Gilbert, Patricius, and Donald, perpetual vicars of
Kingussie,
Logykeny, and Kyncardyn
; Richard, son of William, a chaplain
;
Gilbert de Glencharny, Lord of that Ilk, Andrew Faucounere of Lethinvar, and
Hugh de Ros
of
Kylrawoc, Barons
; Malcolm le Graunt, David Reede, John
de
Brothy, Thomelinus Herys, Ferchinus, and many
others,
cleric and
laic,
placed with my own hands in a large
fire kindled in said chamber to be
burnt,
by sjiecial command of both parties, and together with all the foresaid persons,
saw devoured and consumed by
fire in token and continual memorial that the
Lords of Badenoch cannot demand, or in future ask for anything of the Bishop,
or Church
of Moray in respect
of
foresaid lands.
Upon
all which the Lord
Bishop sought of me notary within written a public instrument, or public instru-
ments to be made for him.
In stable and undoubted testimony of
all which to
the present letters reducted into the form of a public instrument, the said Lord
Alexander Seneschall caused his seal to be appended
: Given and done as above in
presence of the witnesses named.
And I, William de Spyneto, a cleric
of the
diocese of Moray, notary public by imperial authority, was engaged, together with
the foresaid
witnesses
in
all and sundry the premises, while
as
is before
set
forth they were being acted and done, and so I saw and heard these things done,
and from another writ I have reduced them into
this form and have signed in
testimony of all the premises with my sign and usual subscriiition.

84
INVERNESSIANA,
Robert, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all good men of his whole realm;
Greeting
: Know that we have given,
granted, and by this our
i^resent charter
confirmed to our beloved son, Alexander, Earl of Buchan, a half davoch

whatsoever
: Paying therefor, the said Alexander our son, and his heirs, to us and
our
heirs,
annually one penny
silver, in name of blench-farm, at the Castle
of Urquhart, if asked.
The Bishop of Moray, who had a troubled
see, harassed
on the one hand with powerful barons, and on the other by
grasping
titulars, feeling aggrieved at being summoned to,
and thereby held as a subject of the Sheriff Court of Inver-
ness, promulgated the following appeal, entitled
:
Appeal from the Judgment of the Sheriff Court.
Be it known
to
all,
that
we,
Alexander, by the grace
of God, Bishop
of
Moray,
appeal from
the judgment given against us as said is, in the Court of
the Sheriff of our most
excellent
Prince,
Lord Robert, by the
grace of
God,
illustrious King of Scots, held at
Inverness on the 6th day
of the month
of
October, in the year of the Lord 1383,
last past, to the Court of the Justiciar
of our said Lord King, in the matter regarding our giving suit at the said Court
of the Sheriff, and pronounce the judgment null
;
And
if the judgment ought
to be pronounced, it is in itself rotten and corrupt, for this reason, because from
the time
of
the beginning of which men have
no remembrance and to
the
present,
the
continuous Bishops of Moray,
our predecessors, have been and
were, and we, during our time, have been, and
are now,
(saving the present
controversy), in
full and peaceful i)ossession of the privilege of not giving such
suits, with the knowledge and toleration of the late Catholic Princes our Lords,
Kings
of Scotland, and of our present Lord King, and of the Sheriffs of Inver-
ness, who have for the time been, and
if anything was ordained regarding this
matter,
by the non-use, and through
contrary
acts,
with the permission and
tolerance of the Prince, and
of his
servants, and the lapse of
time,
it
is, and
has been removed
; and for other reasons
to be urged
at time and place
; for
which we protest
: In testimony of which appeal our seal is appended to these
presents, which
are
to be handed
to
the
Lord
Sheriff
of
Inverness or
his
Depute.
Given at Spyny, the 5th day of November, in the year of the Lord, 1383.
He
also
issues
the following
procuratory for
serving
his
appeal.
From the procurators being directed
^^ to go to the
chief house of our
said Lord the King
at
Inverness, and
there publish our said appeal,"
&c., it
is obvious that by
this time the Castle had been rebuilt, and then occupied in
the King's name.
The procuratory letter is as follows:
Know all, that we Alexander, by the grace
of God Bishop of Moray, make
and appoint our beloved and discreet men Lords John de Sancto-Clare (Sinclair)
prebendary of Croy, Eustachius of Inverness, canons of our Church, Adam Wyff
and Thomas de Marr, our
servants, and each
of them
in whole, so that the
condition of the occupant be not
better, but what one of them
shall begin,
the
other may pursue and accomplish, our procurators and attorneys for pre-
sentation and publication to Lord William de Fodryghame, acting in room of the
Sheriff of Inverness, or his depute,
of our appeal interponed by us against the
judgment given against us, as said is, in his Court held
at Inverness
the
sixth
day of
the month
of October last
past,
regarding the suit to be made by us
to said Court, and to
find pledge in the hand
of said
Sheriff,
his depute
or
mair, and also in the hand of the Justiciar of our Lord the King, or of any other
of his servants, which
said judgment given against us on said day and place.

INVERNESSIANA.
S5
and regarding
said suit, was and
is bad and
false
:
And
in absence of the
foresaids to go to the chief house of our said Lord the King at Inverness, and
there publish our said appeal,
before witnesses, and to protest
that our right
shall
in no way suffer through
their absence, and
to do
all other and
sundry
which shall be proper regarding the premises, and we promise that we hold valid
and stable everj^thing that shall be done in the
premises
by them, or one of
them.
Given under our seal at Spynie, the 5th day of November, in the year of
the Lord, 1383.
How tlie Bishop compounded differences with Lovat will be
seen in our next.
XXXTII.
ROBERT
II.
1370-1390; PART FIFTH.
Bishop Alexander, at Inverness, upon the 30th of Nov„
1384, made the
following agreement with Hugh
Fraser^
Lord of Loveth, with regard
to the lands of the latter held
of the Bishop, in the Aird.
By this agreement Lovat bound
himself, and gave
his word of honour that he would be a
good friend and faithful
to the Bishop, and
his
subjects,
particularly to those of Kinmylies.
Probably at
this early
period the Lovats had an eye to Kinmylies, though they do
not appear
to have got any charter
to it for two hundred
years after.
^
.
The agreement is as follows :—
^^- ^^' ^^^
Be it clearly known by this authentic
writing, that in the year of the Lord
1384, and on the last day of the month of November,it was agreed upon between
the reverend
father, Lord Alexander, by the Grace of God, Bishop of Moray,
on the one
part, and the
noble man, Hugh Fresel, Lord of
Loveth, on the
other, viz.
:—that the said Hugh without any further delay, or allegation of any
kind
of danger, whether of war or of any other event whatsoever,
from the
day of the contingent comi)letion of these presents, shall pay to the foresaid
Lord Bishop twenty j)ounds sterling of usual money, at the Feasts of Pentecost
and St Martin next to come, by
eqiial portions, and over and above that sum,
fifty shillings at the Feast of St Martin
foresaid
: Surrendering
altogether
all
the debts both of the annual rents of Kyntallirty, Ess, and Munichok (Moniack),
and of the teind-sheaves
of Vardlau due by the
said Hugh for the terms and
seasons bypast, with
this addition, that he shall
offer no impediment from
that time because of any contingent danger, whether of war, or of any other
event whatever, but from that time he, freely and fully satisfy for the annual
rent due by him for Kyntallirty,
Ess, and Munichok, and also that for the rest
no impediment shall
avail,
either for himself or
his, whereby the
said Lord
Bishop may not freely, according to the pleasure of his free
will,
dispose of his
tithes of Yardlau
: And moreover the foresaid Hugh has granted and obliged
himself, having given his word of honour, that he will be a good and faithful
friend to the foresaid Lord Bishop, to all his subjects and possessions, and chiefly
to the two towns of Kynmylies, and shall not offer molestation, or hurt, either to
them
or to any other
of his
whole lands
wherever
situated,
nor permit
as
nauch as he conveniently can, any to be offered by his own subjects or others,
and he shall faithfully and
efficiently give his assistance to obtain redress
for
the losses that have been, or may be inflicted, on said subjects
: And if it happen
that he
fail in payment of said sum of money, and of the annual rent at fore-
said terms,
or offer an impediment,
at any time,
to the levying of the tithes

INVERNESSIANA.
of Vardlau, the whole sum now due and remitted shall revive and be of avail
in the state in which it now is, as if there had been no remission granted
: The
foresaid Hugh has also obliged himself that he
will give
all due diligence to
recover that portion of the annual rent of Kyntallirty and of
le Uss which per-
tains to the part
of the foresaid lands
of Kyntallirty belonging to the noble
man William de Fenton
: And for the faithfully observing of these things the
foresaid parties have to the present writing each appended his
seal, and have
confirmed the same with holy oath.
Given at Inverness, day and year aforesaid.
In
April
1385,
at
a
General
Council, David, Earl of
Strathern, son of King Robert, complains
of his brother,
Alexander the
Senescall, Earl of Buchan, that he occupies
the Barony and Castle of Urquhart to
his prejudice.
The
matter is referred
to amicable arrangement, failing which,
it
is
to be taken up at the next meeting of Council, with
continuation of days.
Among other
matters before the
Council,
the Earl
of
Carrie
is to go
to the northern parts
to
see justice done,
'' because there is heavy and frequent complaint by prelates,
nobles, and very many of the community of the kingdom of
the want of justice in
the upper and northern
parts, that
many evil-doers and Ketherans (broken men) wander about,
congregate and
shelter
there, who by
killing, plundering,
and
burning,
lay waste and
cruelly consume
clergy and
laity."
This same year a tragic event occurred at Inverness, which
is thus narrated in the
^' Red Book" of Clanranald
:—" It was
Donald the son of Angus, that was killed at Inverness (by
his own harper, Mac-i-Cairbe), son of John of the Isles, son
of Alexander, son of Donald, son of John, son of Angus Og."
Upon the 2d day of February 1386, the Bishop of Moray
and
Alexander
the
Seneschal, met
within
the
house
of
Thomas, son of John, burgess of Inverness, and entered into
the following agreement regarding
the
lands
of Rothie-
murchus
and
others.
It
is
entitled
computation made
between Lord zUexander the Seneschal, and Lord Alexander
Bishop of Moray—and is as follows
:
Memorandum that on the second day of the month of February, in the house
of Thomas son of John, burgess
of
Inverness,
in the year 1386,
a reckoning
being made between the Great Lord, Alexander the Senescall, Lord of Badenoch,
on the one part, and Lord Alexander, Bishop of Moray, on the other, regarding
the rent of
E-atraurchus and the annual of Culnecavil (Coulnakyle) within the
barony of Abernethy
:
All things being reckoned and allocated, the foresaid
Lord Alexander remained debtor to the foresaid Lord Bishop in 11 merks, of
which five merks were gifted and remitted, and for the
six merks satisfaction
had been made to the foresaid Lord Bishop.
Concerning other things pending
'twixt them nothing was then done,
as
for instance regarding the tithes of the
justiciary and
sheriff-courts held in his time, nor regarding the sixty shillings
due
for the
tithes
of
the
three Fynlarigs which John
Gray,
Constable
of
Euthven,
received.
Item memorandum that from the time
of the
death of
Christin M'Crath
till the time in which Lord Alexander entered to the Barony
of Abernethy, nothing has been allocated.
The
Countess
of Ross,
being
ill-treated by her second

INVERNESSIANA.
87
husband, separated herself from him.
By sentence of the
Bishops of Moray and Ross pronounced within the church
of the Preaching Friars of Inverness, on 2d November 1389,
she was ordained
to return under certain safe-guards, the
Wolf finding as
his securities, Robert Earl of Sutherland,
Alexander de Moravia of Culbin, and Thomas de Chisholm.
The sentence is as follows
:
In the name of Christ, we, Alexander and Alexander by the
grace of God,
Bishops of the Churches of Moray and Ross, diocesans and judges ordinary of
the parts underwritten, sitting in the judgment seat, and having God alone before
our eyes, by the advice of skilled men with whom we have been in communi-
cation as to all these matters, having heard and understood what each party wished
to offer against the other, and having considered the mode of procedure, pronounce,
decern, and declare by this writ, that Lady Eufamia, Countess of Ross, must be
restored to Lord Alexander,
Senescall, Earl
of Buchan and Lord of Ross,
as
her husband and spouse, together with her possessions
: And we have restored
her as far as by law we can, to be treated honouraby with matrimonial affection

ROBERT II.
1370-1390.
PART SIXTH AND LAST.
In this reign, and in the year 1386, was fought the battle
of Invernahaun,
in the county of
Inverness,
still an im-
portant theme among Gaelic-speaking people, and regarding
which so many anecdotes are current.
The burn where, at
its affluence with the Eileach, the Mackintoshes encamped
after the
first day's combat, in Strath-an-Eileach of Kin-
gussie,
is known
to
this day as
Ault-Reidh-an-Toiseaich.

INVERNESSIANA.
,
Where the leader of the Camerons fell on the following day-
is
the well known Clach-Thearlaich, by the water, and
in
the corry of the same name.
The section which fled by Loch
Errochtside, hotly followed by the Clan Yurich, forming a
sudden rally, cut ofl the head of one of the Macphersons, a
man either of dark complexion, or so designed by his
resi-
dence.
This occurred at a little streamlet near Dalinlongart,
termed Ault-a-ceanndhu.
He was the
last who
fell,
the
pursuit having there ended.
Besides
his
troubles with
the Wolf of Badenoch,
the
Bishop of Moray had many and serious
differences with the
Earl of Moray.
These formed the
subject of reference
to
the Earl of Fife, guardian of the kingdom, afterwards the
noted Duke of Albany,
flis decision was pronounced within
the Church of the Preaching Friars of Inverness, on the
28th of October 1389.
In the pages of our great
novelist,
two men, one in Scottish and the other in English
history,
stand
out
prominently
as
villains
without
a
redeeming
feature, viz., Ramorney in " The Fair Maid of Perth," and
Varney
in
" Kenilworth."
In
the
deed
after
quoted,
Ramorney, then an
esquire,
is found in the
train
of
the
Lord Guardian.
Among the complaints of the Bishop against the Earl of
Moray, was that of encouraging robbers to enter and waste
his lands.
This was a mean, but far from uncommon device
on the part of great Lords, such
as Huntly, Montrose, and
Argyle.
They
were themselves
too
close
to
the
seat
of
Government, and so within reach of the law, that it would
have been dangerous
to
act openly.
It was in this odious
form that nigh three hundred years after this period, so late
as 1634,
the Gordons
revenged
the
^'burning
of
Fren-
draught," so that, as related in a manuscript of 1720,
" the
Crichtons
of
Frendraught
which
once
possessed
three
parishes, Forgue, Inverkeithing, and Aberchirder, were by
these
inroads
of their enemies reduced
to poverty, and in
seventy years were stripped of all and extinguished."
Follows the arrangement
betwixt
the
Bishop
and
the
Earl of Moray :—
Arrangements for amending the complaints of the Bishop of Moray against the Earl
of Moray, and of the Earl against the Bishop> by the Lord Guardian of the
Kingdom with advice of his Council.
This indenture testifieth that on
the
vigil of the Apostles Simon and Jude,
(28th October), in the year of the Lord 1389, in
the Church
of
tlie Preaching
Friars of Inverness, it is ordained and determined by the illustrious man, Lord
Robert, Earl of Fyff and Meneteth, guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland and
his council, both in virtue of his office and by reason of
the submission of the
Lords, the Bishop of Moray on the one pax-t, and the Earl of Moray on the other,
in the form which follows, concerning all and sundry accusations,
actions, com-
plaints, lawsuits, and controversies, real and j)ersona], moved or arisen betwixt

INVERNESSIANA.
89
thein even unto this day
:
First, that the kiss of j)eace being exchanged, they on
both sides
foi* the rest, be and continue true, firm, and cordial friends, and that
none of them by himself, or his, vokmtarily do injury to the otlit-r, and
if this
happen by chance, he who has suffered injury shall require the jiarty injuring to
make amends, and though the latter may not be willing to atone, the former shall
not take vengeance, but refer the matter to the said Lord Guardian, or to our
Lord the King, who shall cause this to be atoned for
:
Item—Thiit the order of
certain
arbiters between the said Bishop and Earl, the order of which arbiters
hereafter follows, be strictly and faithfully observed in all its i^oints and articles
:
And as to the case of Lossy, it
is ordained that
if time
permit, an
assize be
chosen from the lands of the Realty and Kegality, together with others
trust-
worthy, in presence
of the Lord Guardian, which assize shall determine who last
was true and lawful possessor, and he shall possess
; and if because of occupation,
the said Lord
Gxiardian shall not be able to cause a vacancy, he himself shall
give another judge capable of executing his own order
: As to the case of the
indignities offered to the Bishop by the
Earl, by order
of the Guardian, the
Bishop has jjurged himself therefrom, and he has held the Bishop excused that
he made comislaints for the injuiies inflicted upon him
:
As
to the
case
of
following the
Earl's standard,
as
it touches in
iDax't our Lord the King,
it
is
ordained that both parties ought to compear at the next general council, or in
Parliament, to undergo the determination of the general council of our Lord the
King
:
As to the Kethrans (broken men), it is enjoined the Earl, that he purge
himself for their introduction, to the loss of the Bishop ; and because they
(the
Kethrans) have not indemnified him according to his
command, and he
has
purged
himself
therefor,
he
is
commanded
to
aj^point
officers,
wise and
just men,
to execute justice upon the
evil doers
:
Item—The servants of the
Earl are not to take fish from the Bishop's fishers against their will, nor compel
them to
sell to themselves for less than to others, and they are to give satis-
faction
for what has
been, and may
be bought
:
Item—The Earl
is not to
intei'fere with cases belonging to the church court, nor usurp nor hinder the
jurisdiction of the Bishop in wills or others
:
Item—That all the annual rents
due to the Bishoj) from the lands of the Earl, for the terms and years bypast, be
l^aid him at that feast of St Martin in winter
that
shall now next come, and
that he satisfy him and his for
all losses before the feast of the purification of
St Mary next following thereafter.
Follows the order of ai^biters as to the com-
2olaints of the Earl against the Bisho20
:
First as to the town of Cuthilfeld, let a
perambulation be made with common consent
of the Lords
:
For
this, that
the Bishop caused the men of the
Earl
to swear before Lord Alexander,
the
Senescall, &c
:
Since he has done this for the better he shall not be punished
:
And, for this, that it is said that he excommunicated the squires of the Earl on
account of
a robe
:
The Bishop denies, but
let him
refrain from such things
in future
; Regarding the process against those who captured the lord treasurer,
&c.
:
The Bishop has not done enough by excommunicating, but he ought also
to have imposed an interdict
:
As
to
the
sustentation
of the manors
in the
canohry, and the non-resident,
let the Earl make provision as before, and let
him
chiefly demand
it
for the repair of the church and non-residence, when
the Bishop and the chapter
(do)
this
:
As to those coming to
the water
of
Petgavny,
if
it can be proved
let the Bishop atone and cease for the future
:
For the slaughter of David
de
Berclay,
let the Bishop purge himself, and he
in presence of the said Lord Guardian and his Coimcil, with the Lords Bishops
of Ross,
Caithness, and Abbot
of Kinloss,
and many others,
for this (made)
solemn x^ui-gation
:
Item —The Bishop may compel those who defile the Church
of St Egidius to give satisfaction by reconciliation, and let the Bishop restore to
the burgesses the money received from them for this purpose
:
Regai'ding the
boy
of Peter Grame,
the Bishop
is without
fault.
Folloivs
the
order of
the
arbiters regarding the comjylaints of the Bishop against the Earl
:
First, Let the
Earl cause
all those, whom he says and aj)proves to be his, to answer and abide
the law to the Bishop and
his, for the
losses
inflicted by them, or let the Earl
himself give
satisfaction
for them
:
Item— Let
the
servants
of
the
Bishop
distrain and poind the lands of the Earl for the annual rent, and let them take
the poinds to the lands of the Bishop
;
as the arbiters have seen the evidents
of King Alexander for this course, and
let the annual rents of the time bypast
be restored to the Bishop
: For the annual rent of Muthes satisfaction is made
by the Earl to Lord Alexander, the Senescall, and let the Bishop seek frOm him
:
Regarding the corn of Dolesbrachti, let the Earl satisfy the Bishop,
if he has
not satisfied Lord Alexander, for said corn
:
Regarding the rents of the tithes
of the Churches of
Elgin, Dyk,
and
all other
tithes,
let
the
receivers and
debtors be compelled by the Bishop to pay
:
As to John de Pylmur, let him
M

90
INVERNESSIANA.
satisfy the Bishop
for the malt taken away from the Mill ot Grange
:
Let the
Earl compel Alexander de Greenlau to satisfy the burgesses for the tithes of
Levynyshalch, and let the burgesses
satisfy the
Lord Bishop
:
Let Haugand
Schaw and William Cocas
give
satisfaction
for the losses of Auchonkeny, for
Avhioh the Lord Treasurer will be responsible
:
As to the Friars of Mala Villa,
let the Earl commit the cause to some good man who shall do justice to the
Bisliop and others complaining of them
:
The same course is to be pursued with
regard to Henry Grame, Alexander Grenlau, Slorach, John Bard, and Kobert
Ciaufurd.
Item—That the immunity and decency (honestas) of the cloister and
chauonrj'must be observed, and neither the Earl, his friends, nor guests may stable
horses,
nor
seize
the
houses,
nor
break open
nor burn
the
gardens
of the
Canons.
Item—That the Earl's chaplain may not hereafter receive the excom-
mindcated
to the
Sacraments
in
his
Chapel, nor others to the prejudice
of
mother Church, and that he restore all offerings to the parish Church
: James
de Jonystoun must satisfy the wounded William Swan
: As to John Eraser, the
friend
of Hugh
Eraser,
let
the Earl cause him to make amends to Thomas of
Kirktoun
:
Kegarding the horses of the Earl,
let them not hereafter be sent
into the lands
of the Bishop
:
The oxen,
horses, and other property
of
the
Bishop's men, taken at the time of the fair of St Egidius,
are to
be
restored
:
Noblemen
in
quest of corn
or other goods are not hereafter to beg for it, nor
labour to this end
; or let them send among the husbandmen
:
As
to the 40s
received by Symon Faber, let the Earl cause him to restore them
: Ysaac de Forp
must be given up to the Bishop, and let him execute justice upon him
:
As to
Alexander M'Caneny,
if he can be found within the Kegality, let a pledge be
found, and
let the Earl do justice
:
As to the tithes of the Canons and
clerics,
the
Earl must henceforth leave them, and neither intromit with them himself
nor by his
: Moreover, these things above written,
all and sundry, the foresaid
Lord Earl with his Council, commanded and oidered to be fulfilled and faithfully
observed by the
said Bishop and Earl and
theirs, under the
i^ain of £200 of
usual money,
to be applied without remission to the fabric of the Church of
Moray, when and as often as anything should be done contrary
to any of the
premises
:
In testimony of all which,

XXXV.
ROBERT III.
1390-1406.
PART FIRST.
Eobert III. liad hardly succeeded to the throne, when his
brother,
the Wolf of Badenoch, capped
all previous
evils
done
to the
Bishop of Moray, by the
destruction
of
the
Cathedral.
The Wolf is known to this day among
Gaelic-
speaking people as Alasdair Mor.
This event occurred in June 1390, and is briefly noted in the
Chartulary of Moray, under the head of " Quedam Memora-
bilia," in these terms
:

INVERNESSIANA,
91
In that year, before said Coronation [that of Robert III.], the followers of Lord
Alexandei', the Senescall, son of the deceased King, in the end of the month of
May burnt the town of Forres, and the choir of the Clmrch of St Lawrence,
and the manor of the Archdeacon within the town, and in
the month of June
following, on the feast of St Botulph the Abbot, in the presence of the said Lord
Alexander, they bnrnt the whole town
of Elgin and the Church of St Egidius
therein, the House of God near Elgin, eighteen noble and beautiful mansions
belonging to the canons and chaplains, and which must be more bitterly deplored,
the
noble and beautiful Church of Moray, the miiTor of our native country and
the honour of the kingdom, with
all the books,
charters,
and other valuable
things of the country therein kept for security.
The loss of the books and charters is irreparable, but it is
fortunate that the Chartulary,
afterwards compiled, which
has been printed by the Bannatyne Club, and
to which we
are so much indebted,
is so full.
The Wolf before this had
received a charter of the Castle Hill of the town of Inverness,
with ane taillie without
date.
This
charter, unfortunately,
does not appear
to be extant, though of local
interest, but
as it is noted in a roll of charters, before a charter
to John
Earl of Moray of inter alia of £20
sterling out of the great
custom
of
the
burgh
of
Inverness,
dated,
Edinburgh,
5th April, 1390, it is evident
it was granted prior to that
date.
The celebrated fight on the North
Inch, of St Johnston,
occurred on
the 28th of September 1396.
As the question
of the identity of the respective combatants
is not
likely
ever
to be authoritatively ascertained and
laid
at
rest, we
content ourselves with the brief notandmn in the Chartulary
of Moray, under the head before referred
to
of
^' Qaedam
Memorabilia"
:
Memorandum that in the year of the Lord 1396, on the 28th day of the month
of September, at Perth, before Lord Robert King of Scotland and the nobles of
the kingdom, there assembled for the purpose, since a firm peace could not be
made 'twixt tbe two
clans,
to wit of Clanhay and Clanqwhwle, but slaughters
and plunders were being committed
daily on
both
sides,
thirty
of
eiich side
without armour of iron (mail) witli axes, swords, and small knives (dirks), however,
met by agreement, that one party might sweep away and destroy the other, and
they engaged in conflict.
The whole party of Clanhay, except one, succumbed and
died on the field, and of the other party ten were left surviving.
Alexander, Bishop of Moray, was dead by 1398, but his
successor,
William,
finds
himself
in
collision
with
civil
jurisdiction.
The reasons after given are against a judgment
pronounced by William deFodryngham, theDepute-Sheriff of
Inverness, at Inverness on 1st October 1398.
The document
is dated on
the anniversary of the 11,000
Virgins.
It
is
not a little singular that this day is one of four feasts in all
recorded
for
October
in
the
" Kalendarium
Qiioddam
Celticum"
(Celtic Calendar), viz.— 3d October, St Francis
;
18th, Luke the Evangelist;
21st, Eleven Thousand Virgins
—aen mile deg lanogli

Jude

Reasons against the Judgment of the Court of the Sheriff.
The reasons of William, Bishop of Moray, against the judgment given agninst
him at Inverness, in the Court of the Sheriff, on the
first day of the month of
October, in the year of
the Lord 1398
:
First, since from the time
of whose
I
»
i'~
y
beginning the memory of men has no recollection, and to this time continuously
''**t^ f /
**
'
*^^® Bishops of Moray, his i^redecesors, have been, and were, and he himself during
/
his time has
been, and
is,
to-day, saving the present controversy, in full and
peaceful possession of the liberty of not giving suits at the Courts of the Sheriff
of
Inverness.
The deceased Catholic Princes, the Lords Kings of Scotland, and
our i^resent Lord King, and the Sheriffs
of Inverness, who for the time have
been, knew, and allowed this, and
if any thing has been ordained regarding
this from want of
i)ractice, and through contrary acts with the indulgence of
the Prince and the i^ermission of his servants, and the lapse of time, it has been
and is removed
:
Item —That the Church of Moray and the Bishop have been
for many years immediately and continuously preceding in peaceful possession
of the liberty of not giving
suits
at
said Court of the
Sheriff, and according
to the statutes of King Robert, ought not to be deprived of the possession
of
that liberty, which they have held for a year and more without a legal writ
Item- -Because the Court in which the judgment was given was no Court, for in
such Court there ought to be a Sheriff or his lieutenant, three
or
four
suitors,
a
clerk of feu and judge of feu
; now in that Court there was only one
suitor,
viz.
:—John, son of Michael, suitor of Avoch ; nor was there a clerk of feu nor judge,
but said John Michael, who was only a suitor in Court, and was assumed as a
judge, and gave that judgment, and so performed the office of Court and judge
:
Item—Because
all the lands of the Church
of Moray were given in pure and
perpetual charity, and so for these such suit is not due
:
Item—All suit is due
for a certain fixed place, but the Bishop of Moray has no such place
for which
he ought to give such suit
:
/i^em—Because there ought not to be suspected
and inimical judges, and Lord William de Fodryngham, Knight, lieutenant of
the Lord Sheriff of
Inverness, says publicly in i)resence of many that he never
will be a friend to Lord William, Bishop of Moray
:
Item—Because the said
John Michael, who passed sentence, had no iiower to pronounce such a sentence,
as he is not a man of free estate
:
Item—Because the sentence was not engrossed
in writing
:
Item—Because the members of Court were not sufficient for deter-
mining such
a cause
:
Item—Because the Bishop was not
lawfully cited
to
proceed in
the cause nor to hear
sentence.
The Bishop therefore
seeks
all
innovations after
interposition of appeal from said judgment to be completely
recalled, and
first of
all by the judge of
apj)eal—viz., the Lord Justiciar, and
also those
things which in the meantime between the sentence and the appeal
which was afterward interposed from it by means of the
triers, be recalled as if
they had been renewed after appeal, and that the judgment given had been bad
and inconsiderate, and that said Bishop had
ai:)pealed properly, and ye
will
so pronounce, if the Loi'd be
in your heart.
These reasons were presented
to
Lord William de Camera, Clerk of Justiciary at Elgin, on the anniversary of the
martyrdom of
the 11,000 holy
virgins
(21st
Oct.),
in the year
foresaid,
and
there were present the
discreet men Lord Robert Cantor (chanter), canon of
Koss, Stephen Wode, and Galfridus de Rainfrew, burgesses of Aberdeen
; and
Robert de Moravia, burgess of Elgin
; and many other witnesses to the premises,
closed by said Lord Bishop under his seal.
The letter of
sist, by Murdoch the
seneschall, following
upon the foregoing reasons, is now given
:

:
Since it
appears
to
us, by our
clerk of justiciary, that the venerable
father in
Christ,
Lord William, by the grace of God Bishop of Moray, has aj^pealed from a certain
judgment
given
against
him,
if
it may be called a judgment, pronounced
in
your court at Inverness, on the
1st day of the month of Octoljer last past, at
our justice-aire court last held within your sheriffship, and as he declares that
said judgment,
if judgment
it may be
called, is null
in
itself and badly given,
and he contradicts said judgment by his
letters i^atent, and by reasons therein
contained, showing by said reasons that he
is
not bound to give suit at your
court foresaid, and asking
of the authority
of our
office, and in virtue
of
his
appeal, such remedy that you may not do any further prejudice to himself or

his church of Moray in
their

: We command and order you, by the
authority of our office,
tliat as soon as ye see these presents ye
stop progress
in said process, and see ye take care to meddle no further in said judgment or
in any other process touching that cause by petition of suit or by receiving of
fine, or anything thereto appertaining until at our justice aire next to be held within
your jurisdidtion
it shall be determined whether said judgment, so given and
contradicted by said Bishop, and
so by him appealed
against, was well
or
ill
given.
Moi-eover, warn
all suitors
of your court
foresaid, who were consenting
at the pronouncing of said judgment, that they compear before us at our next
justice aire to hear the determination of said judgment in form of law.
And see
that ye or they do not omit
these in any way, under every pain which may
follow such omission.
Seeing that the said Lord Bishop has found in the hand
of our justiciary
clerk in our room a pledge that the judgment
is none, and
if it may be called a judgment, it is in itself nau^t and corrupt.

of which thing we have caused the
seal of our office

ROBERT III.
1390-1406. PART SECOND.
William, Bishop of Moray, was much troubled by Alex-
ander of the Isles, third son of John, Lord of the Isles, best
known in the Highlands
as Alasdair
Carracli,
first
of the
house of Keppoch.
By the document after quoted, Alasdair
in the year 1398 took it on himself to partition the Bishop's
lands of Kinmylies, originally granted by Alexander 11. , in
the following manner
:— Upper or Wester Kinmylies to one
Reginald Macalyshander, Lower or Easter Kinmylies, now
Muirtown, to John de Chisholm, and
the fishings on the
Ness
to John
Qwhyte, burgess
of
Inverness.
From
this
period down
to
the
close of the 17th
century, or
for three
hundred
years,
the
family
of Keppoch,
as
opportunities
arose, continued
their attentions towards
Inverness, which
were by no means valued or appreciated by the burgh.
On
the contrary, an outpost was erected where watchers, to give
notice of the dreaded approach of the Macdonalds and other
western
tribes, constantly lay.
This was at
Ballifeary, the
town or place of watching.
Clachnaharry has the same
signification, being the stone
behind which watchers regarded
the opposite and
hostile
coasts of Ross.
The ill-feeling and jealousy entertained by
Inverness to Dingwall, Tain, and other northern burghs will
be abundantly illustrated by-and-bye.
^
At this early period water must have overflowed inuch of
what has now been reclaimed.
The line of rocks at Clach-
naharry ran into the sea, and communication from the Aird

94
INVERNESSIANA.
was alone practicable by the broad road, still reraaining in
part, which crept up the slope of the Leachkin, having, as
the
traveller went northward, the Craig Phadric range
to
the right.
It is certain the inner Moray Firth, and notably the Beauly
Firth, are both receding
; and the quantity of land reclaimed
betwixt Clachnaharry on the one side, and Millburn on the
other, within the last one hundred and fifty years is incredible.
It is to be hoped that much of the foreshore from the Long-
man's Grave to Alturlies, ex adverso of the lands of Raigmore
and Culloden, and others, will soon be reclaimed.
Not only
would a great eyesore, when the
tide
is at
its ebb, be re-
moved,
but
the
reclaimed
land would form
a
sure
and
valuable wintering, and better bathing waters, much needed
at Inverness, could be had.
Follows the warning against those occupying the lands of
Kinmylies
:
iMM'l^f^/. Zll.
William, by
divine mercy Bishop
of Moray, to Lord Donald,
dean
of the
/
Christianity of Inverness
(the Deanry of
Inverness), and to the parish chaplain
of the church of Inverness, and to any of them
; Greeting in the Lord, and to
diligently attend to and perform the within-vrritten
: We have lately heard
with displeasure that the illustrious man and
potent, Alexander
of the Isles,
Lord
of Lochaber, led
astray by the advice of certain parties, though he could
not by right and fact (de jure de facto) however, gave in donation the land of
Upper Kinmylies to Eaynald Mac Alyschandir, and the land of Lower Kinmylies
to John de Cheshelm
of
the Aird, and the fishing of Lower Kinmylies
or the
keeping of it to John Qwhyte, burgess of Inverness, which lands and towns were
and are with the fishing foresaid and other pertinents the property of the church
of Moray, and belonged to it from the time of whose beginning mankind has no
recollection, by the
gift
of Alexander, King
of Scotland, and in
j)OSsession of
which our predecessors the Bishops of Moray have been and we have been during
our time, and now are peacefully and quietly with the excei)tion of the present
controversy
: That therefore such hurt may not turn to the damage and prejudice
of our church and the prejudice of us and the gift of the King, we
enjoin and
command you and each of you, under pain of canon law, that ye and each of
you inhibit the foresaid Raynald and John, and their procurators and attorneys,
if they any have, under pain of excommunication, from meddling with said lands
or
their
fruits
or with
said
fishing, but allow us and the church of Moray as
peacefully enjoy
said
lands
as
our
predecessors
peacefully
possessed
them.
Therefore
pviblicly proclaim and cause to be proclaimed these
warnings,
both
in the church on Sundays and
feasts, and
at the
cross
in
public on mai'ket
days and at the market place, to the end it may possibly reach their knowledge
:
Also warn the saids Eaynald, John, and John, and their attorneys, when they
meet you or ye can find them, to refrain from committing the injuries aforesaid
:
And preserve one of
these our
letters to be made public
to the
eyes of
all by
being fixed
to the doors
of the church, and the
other faithfully beside you
for
making execution thereof
:
In testimony of this our mandate we have caused
our authentic
seal
to be appended to
these i^resents.
Given in our church of
Moray the 20th day November in the year of the Lord 1398.
Four years afterwards, on the 3d
of July 1402, Alasdair
Carrach did much mischief at Elgin by robbing the canonry
and burning
the town.
He made amends, however, on the
6th of October following, all
as detailed under the heading
in
the chartulary
of Moray
already
referred
to
in
these
words
:

Memorandum that when Alexander of the
Isles, third
son
of the
Iiord
of
the
Isles, had
violently entered the Canonry
of Elgin with
his captains, on
the third day of the month of Jiily, in the year of the Lord
1402, and had com-
pletely plundered it of
all goods found therein, and had burnt in great part the
town
of
Elgin, and returned to his own people with the
spoil, then he came
back with a great army to the Canonry of Elgin on the 6th day of the month of
October following, and being
informed that the canonry enjoyed from of old
immunity and
privilege of refuge, and that he and his because
of the
infringe-
ment and violation of the immunity had incurred the sentence of excommunica-
tion, he and his upon reflection humbly
entreated to be absolved
: And
the
reverend
in Christ, Lord William of Spyny, Bishop
of Moray, first before the
doors of the church and afterwards
before
the great
altar, being
pontifically
arrayed, absolved theiii
: And Alexander himself
offered a great cross with gold
inlaid, and the rest of the captains in suitable manner each a small image, and
he commanded the cross
to be
raised along with
a
bell where the immunity
begins in the direction of the town.
Before parting with Alasdair Carracli, it is just to say that
in the ancient and
fine
Gaelic poem of " The Owl," he
is
thus referred to
:
Chunnaic mi Alasdair Carrach,
An duin' is allaile bha 'n Albainn,

(Alasdair Carrach^ have I seen,
The most illustrious man in Scotland,
Oft have I listened to him.

Upon the 20th of August 1400, William, Bishop of Moray^
demands payment of four merks from the Abbey of Arbroath's
churches
of
Aberchirder
and
Inverness,
in name
of the
subsidy imposed on all benefices within the diocese of Moray,
for the rebuilding of the Cathedral.

ROBERT III.
1390-1406.
PART THIRD AND LAST.
The agreement after referred to, betwixt Alasdair Carrach
and the Earl of Moray, might have given some countenance
to the proceedings of the former regarding Kinmylies, re-
ferred
to
in
the
preceding
chapter.
At
Caldor,
in
the
Sheriffdom of Nairn, on the 25th of September 1394, an
agreement
is come
to
'twixt Thomas de Dunbar, Earl of
Moray,
and
Alexander
of
the
Isles,
Lord
of
Lochaber.
Alexander
shall have under
his guardianship, defence, and
protection, all lands and possessions of the regality of Moray,
and
all church lands, for a term
of seven years from the

date of signing the deed, and he shall adhere
to and stand
by said Earl, against all, save the King, the Earl of Fife,
and the Lord of the Isles.
The excepted lands are those of
Hugh Eraser, Thomas de Chesholme, and Lord William de
Fodrynham, regarding whom there is an agreement betwixt
them.
The Earl for said term shall give to Alexander yearly
80 merks
of lands—viz., le Bonacht
for £20, the lands of
Essy for ^20, and 20 merks
to be
paid, ten merks at the
Feast of Pentecost next
to come, and the other ten merks
at the Feast of St Martin next thereafter following, and so
on yearly until
it
shall have been
settled by the advice of
the Lord the Earl of Fife, regarding
the lands of twenty
merks, which Malcolm de Grant has, that
they belong
to
the Earl of Moray.
After
this has been settled, Alexander
shall receive according to the old taxation, &c.
The document is signed in duplicate by the parties.
There
are no witnesses.
In
this reign occurred the fight
in the neighbourhood,
of Inverness, which gave
rise,
as
is generally
credited, to
the name of Loban.
The following account is that given by
David Carey,
the
first
editor of the
Inverness Journal, who
appears to have taken much interest in Highland Traditions
during his
stay in the north, 1807-1812.
This, however,
did not make him an
authentic
writer,
for
in
his
novel,
^' Lochiel, or the Field of Culloden," history is travestied in
a singular manner
:
Druim-deur, i.e., E-idge of Tears, now called Drtimderfait,
is a mountainous
ridge on the north side
of Kessock, which tradition
reports
to have been the
scene of a most sanguinary event, from which
it no doubt derived
its name.
The circumstances are said to have been as follows
: About the year 1400, Donald
Lord of the Isles, who, it would seem, treading in the footsteps of his ancestors,
was anxious
to
rival the exploits of the Vikings
of
yore,
having collected a
powerful army, made a descent on the coast of Ross, and encamped on
this ridge
of rocks facing the town of Inverness, which he threatened with fire and sword, if
not ransomed at a most exorbitant rate.
Luckily for the town, the Provost,
whose name was Junor, was a man of
great penetration and address.
Aware
of the
situation of Donald's army, which had been greatly fatigued, and was
in the utmost want of provisions. Provost Junor, who, by temporising, had ob-
tained a short delay, contrived to smuggle into Donald's camp a vast quantity
of
strong liquors, which were eagerly consumed by
the besiegers, who soon
owned the power of the
potent
beverage
by sinking
into the most profound
slumber.
In the meantime,
the Provost collected
a number
of
resolute ad-
herents, and landing with his arma hlanca
at dead of night,
in the midst of
Donald's camp, massacred every man who was found within it, except one single
individual, who escaped by hiding himself beneath, a loban, a species of basket,
which is dragged upon two parallel pieces of wood, with the
ends laid upon an
axle, and serves
instead of
a cart in various
parts
of the Highlands.
This
islander, who was
so
providentially permitted to
survive his
less
fortunate
countrymen, unwilling, it may be supposed, to be the bearer of stich melancliQly
tidings to
his friends
at home, afterwards took up his residence on the very
spot where this tragedy was acted, and his descendants have to this day followed
his example, by
residing upon and
cviltivating the same portion
of ground,
which they have occupied as labourers or tenants for these four hundred years,
and have been known by the name of Logan,
or more properly Loban, from
the vehicle which saved the life of the founder of the family.

INVERNESSIANA.
97
About the year
1398,
Charles Macgilleane of the very
ancient house of Maclean
settled
in the ^'orth under the
protection of Donald, Lord of the
Isles.
He had lands in
Urquhart
and was
Constable
of
the
Castle.
From him
sprung all the Macleans in the North, known as Clan Thearlaich.
From their long connection with Inverness and
its neigh-
bourhood, first in Urquhart, afterwards at Bona and Doch-
garroch, it is intended in next chapter to give some particulars
of this family, the second in continuous standing connected
with the parish of Inverness.
The families third and fourth
in
this
position,
are
Robertson of
lushes, and
Baillie of
Dochfour and Dunean.
In 1405, payment in
lieu of the coquet of Inverness
is
made of new by command of the Duke of Albany, within the
tune of the account of 10s, by William de Camera, to William
Modena the King's Claviger (key-bearer).

(Lammas) in the year 1405 to the date of this account.

of 24 lasts 13
dakirs* of skins conveyed in two vessels to

XXXVIII.
JAMES
I.
1406 1437.
PART FIRST.
Although James
I. began to reign nominally in 1406, yet
from his long captivity in England, the supreme power lay
with the Dukes of Albany, the Regents.
More immediately
connected with
the north
at
this epoch, the unjust setting
aside by the first Regent of the claims of Donald, Lord of
the Isles, to the Earldom of Ross, gave rise to the battle of
Harlaw, and numerous disturbances in the Highlands^j^hich
were only, and then but
for a time, settled byJKing James
when he came to Inverness in 1427.
It is stated in the M.S.
History of the Erasers that " in
the march of Donald of the Isles, before this fight, he burnt
the greatest part of Inverness, and the oak bridge, one of
the finest
in the kingdom.
One John Cumine, a burgess,
son of Cumine of Earnside, in Moray, arrayed
in his head-
piece, and armed with a two-handed sword, offered so stout
a resistance at the west end of the bridge, as would have
compelled the assailants, had there been tea such men (says
the chronicler) in the town, to have retired in dismay."
In
a curious and
in many respects highly incorrect fragment
of a manuscript history of the Macdonalds, written
in the
reign of Charles II., and published by the lona Club, the
following
references
are made
to
the part
taken
by
the
Mackintoshes
:—" He (Macdonald) ordered the rest
to the
wings, the right commanded by Hector Roy Maclean, and
the left by Callum beg Mackintosh, who had that day received
from
Macdonald
a
right
of
the
lands
of
Glengarry
in
Lochaber, by way of
pleasing him
for
yielding the
right
wing
to Maclean, and
to prevent any quarrel between him
and Maclean.
Mackintosh
said he would take the lands,
and
make
the
left
behave
as
well
as
the
rights
A
little
further on the writer proceeds, " Now it happened this same
Callum beg Mackintosh was with King James
I. after his
release from
his
captivity
in England,
in the same place
where the battle was fought.
The King asked him how far
they
followed
the
chase.
Mackintosh
replied
that
they
followed it farther than His Majesty thought.
So the King
riding on a pretty pace, asked Mackintosh if they came that
length.
He answering, said that in his opinion there was a
heap of stones before them, and that he left there a mark to
show that he followed the chase that length, and with that

r
INVERNESSIANA.
99
he bronglit a man's arm with
its gauntlet out of the heap.
The King behokling
it,
desired him
to be with him that
night at Aberdeen.
The King upon his arrival there going
to
his
lodgings,
Mackintosh
said
in
presence
of the
b}^-
standers, that he had performed
his word
to the King, and
now he woukl betake himself to his own lodgings; where-
upon he immediately left the town, for he dreaded that the
King would apprehend him."
The
M.S.
History
of
the
Mackintoshes
records
with
reference to Harlaw
:— ^' In this war he (Malcolm) lost many
of his
friends,
particularly James
Mackintosh (Shaw)
of
Rothiemurchus.
Many
of
the
tribe
of
Clan
Yean
were
afterwards missed."
The Mackintoshes' spirited and prudent
conduct at Harlaw might have been advantageously followed
by the Macdonalds whf^n they were unfortunately transferred
by the Commander-in-Chief, to the left wing at Culioden.
The famous poem
'' The War
Song,
by
Lachlan
Mor
Macvurich, of Albin, to Donald of Isla, King of the Isles,
/
i
and Earl
of Ross, on
the Day of the
Field
of Harlaw,"
composed to excite the enthusiasm of the followers of Donald
\o^
of the Isles, should be studied by those who assert that the \
Gaelic language is of limited compass.
There are in alpha-
'
;
betical
order,
lines
for
almost every
letter
in
the
Gaelic
alphabet, together consisting of three hundred and
thirty-
eight, each letter being first exhausted, some having upwards
of forty alliteratives, the whole forming a chain of epithets
so copious, but pointed and
incisive, as to excite
astonish-
ment and admiration.
The battle of Harlaw was fought on
24th July 1411.
In 1412, we find from " the accounts of the great chamber-
lains of Scotland,"
&c., that "payment
is made
to Lord
Alexander, Earl of Mar, for various labours and expenses
incurred
in the war against the Lord of the
Isles, for the
utility of the whole kingdom, of £122 7s 4d
; and
also to
him for the construction of a fortalice at Inverness, for the
utility of the kingdom, against said Lord of the
Isles, of
£100
; and for lime to Inverness for the construction of said
fortalice, and for food and the carriage of wood, £32 10s 3d.
In 1414, payment is made to Lord Alexander, Earl of Mar,
in consideration of his
divers labours and expenses about
the Castle of Inverness, of £52 lis 3d."
In 1414, Donald Thane of Cawdor
is served heir to his
father Andrew, in the lands
of Dunmaglass.
The inquest
was held at the Castle
Hill
of Inverness, and
a copy from
the Cawdor
papers
is given
as it
contains
several names
connected with the town.
Dunmaglass, which
is still held

in feu of the Earl of Cawdor, has thus been long in the
Cawdor
titles.
The lands were feued
to the head of the
tribe Macgillivray in 1626, whose descendant now possesses
them.
Follows the " Retoured Inquest of Donald Thane ot
Cawdor :"
This inquest was made at the Castle Hill of Inverness, the 20th day of the
month of June, in the year of the Lord 1414, before Nicholissa de Kerdale, and
William de Grame, lords and portioners of the barony of Kerdale, in the earldom
of Moray, within the sheriffdom of
Inverness, and
lords superior of the lands
of Doymcglass
(Dunmaglass), and Lord Thomas Senescall, their
bailie in that
part,
by those
within
written,
viz.
:—John son of Thomas,
Provost
of
the
burgh of Inverness, William le Eoss, Hugh Symson, John Pollock, William son
of Thomas, Donald son of Farchard, William de Altrilly, John son of Walter,
Gilbrede
M'Michy,
Gillemore M'Phale, Paul Duff, Donald son of Rotheric,
John son of Kotheric, John Bridison, Fergusius M 'Lucas, Martin M'Fery, and
Brydas
son
of .Oristin, who,
being
faithfully
sworn,
declare
that
the
late
Andrew de Oaldor,
father of Donald Thane of Caldor, bearer of these presents,
died vest and seised,
as of feu, at the faith and i^eace of our Lord the King of
Scotland, of the lands
of Duninaglass, with the pertinents
; and that the said
Donald of Caldor is lawful and nearest heir of the said late Andrew, his father,
of said lands with the
pertinents, and
is
of lawful age
: And that the
said
lands of Dunmaglass, with the pertinents, are held of the barony of Kerdale, and
that they are held blench-farm
: Paying one silver penny ab the Feast of Pente-
cost if asked only
: And that the
said Donald failed in nothing with regard to
the Lord King, or the Lords his superiors,
for which he ought not by law to
recover his
heritage
: In testimony of which Inquest, the seal of the said Lord
Thomas Senescall, bailie of said lords of Kerdale, is appended to these presents,
together with the seals of those who were engaged on said Inquest
: Year, day,
month, and place foresaid.
As followers of the Lords of the Isles, whose power in the
eastern portion of Inverness and
Ross became important
when the Earldom of Ross opened
to them, Macleans and
Macleods of insular derivation began to establish a footing
in these places.
The first of the Macleans who
settled
in the north was
Charles
Maclean,
a
descendant
of
the
ancient
house
of
Maclean, which first divided into two great branches, those
of Duart and Lochbuy.
This
Charles
Maclean had some
post in the Castle of Urquhart, with various
lands, and by
him was erected, as is matter of tradition, Castle Spioridail
of Bona.
Charles Maclean was
the founder
of the Clan
Thearlaich, and not having a sufiicient following of his own,
enrolled himself with the Clan Chattan.
This occurred in
the time of the before-mentioned Malcolm beg Mackintosh,
who succeeded in 1409 and died about 1457, and the event
is recorded in the M.S.
History in
these terms—"To
this
Malcolm,—Tearlaich, vic-Eachin, vic-A^olan, (sic) from whom
the family of Clan Tearlaich sprung, subscribed himself and
his successors, followers for ever."
The name of Charles, with that of Hector his son, is found as
witnesses in the deed after referred to, granted by Alexander
Earl of Ross, in 1439.
At Inverness, on
the 24th of October in
the year 1439,

I
INVERNESSIANA.
101
Alexander,
Earl
of Ross,
grants
obligation
in
favour
of
Alexander Sutherland and his spouse, Marion of the
'' Ilys,"
sister of said Earl, and their heirs,
to the effect that he will
be upright with them in the defence of the castle and lands
of Dunbeth, and the lands of Ra, with the pertinents
^' agane
all tlia that leffis ore dee may."
In the event of the loss of
said lands, the Earl
obliges himself to give to said
parties
as much lands heritably as shall be an equivalent from those
of his own,
" betwxe
the bryg of Alnes and the gyrth of
Tavne, within the Erldovvm of Ross."
The witnesses
are
Lauchlayne Maklan
of Dowart, John Makloyde
of Dun-
vegane,
Carlich Mackachyn, Alexander Maccullauch,
and
Aychyn Carlichsonn, with sundry others.
The above Hector, designed in the MS. " Hector M^Tear-
lach, chief of that family," married Margaret, third daughter
of the above named Malcolm Mackintosh.
His descendant,
Alexander, vic-Coil, vic-Farquhar, vic-Eachen, on 4th April
1609, subscribed for himself and his race of Clan Tearlaich
a new bond of unity with the Clan Chattan, and there have
been
several
intermarriages
in
later
times
betwixt
the
Mackintoshes and Macleans.
Hector Maclean, with
several of his
sons, was
killed
at
Castle Spioridail, about the year 1480, some say at an earlier
period, leaving in life, but one son, Farquhar, a child.
From
this circumstance, and from want of powerful
friends,
the
Macleans were unable
to maintain their hold in Urquhart,
which was possessed by the Grants.
The Macleans, however,
held
certain
rights
in the
district
as
late
as
1680.
The
ancient title-deeds of Dochgarroch are not now
extant, but
it
is understood that the above Farquhar Maclean was the
first who possessed Dochgarroch, and his son Donald, styled
Donald Farquhar's son,
is found there in the year 1557, as
appears from the record of an inquest held in Inverness on
the 31st July 1557.
Both Farquhar and Donald had a
title
to the island of
Raasay flowing from the Bishops of the Isles, but it is very
doubtful if they derived an}^ benefit, for Archdeacon Munro,
writing in 1549, speaks of it and of the island of Rona,
*' as
pertaining
to Macgilliecallum of Raasay be the sword, and
to ye Bishope of ye Isles be heritage."
So late as 1630 Alexander, before-named
in 1609, son of
Donald Maclean, son of Farquhar, son of Hector,
is served
heir to his predecessors in
the kinds of Raasay and
others,
but these were never given up by the Macleods.
In the time of this Alexander Maclean, the family was at
its strongest.
He was thrice married, first to a daughter of

102
INVERNESSIANA.
Kilravock, second
to
a daughter of Glenmoriston, through
whom the family was carried on, and third to a daughter of
Munro of Daan, in the county of Ross.
Alexander acquired the easter half of Dochgarroch in feu
from the Gordons, the wester half from William
Baillie of
Duncan, and from
his time the Macleans
of Dochgarroch
have in peace and war had an honourable
position.
John
Maclean, the head of the family, was out
with
Dundee in
1689, and fought
at
Killiecrankie.
His
son, Lachlan, was
an officer in Borlum's
battalion in 1715.
John, eldest son
of the proprietor at the time, was killed at Culloden.
Every
generation
since
that time
has
sent out as
soldiers some
members of the family, who have always acquitted themselves
with
credit.
Allan
Maclean,
Esq., Drummond,
formerly
one of the Magistrates of Inverness, is tenth in direct descent
from Charles, who first
settled
in the north, and according
to the late Colonel Maclean of Woodside,
in
his
history of
Clan Tearlaich,22d in direct descent from Gillean-na-Tuaidh,
the hero of Mingarry Muir fight in 1178.
XXXIX.
JAMES
I.
1406-1437.
PART SECOND.
King James returned from captivity in April 1424, and
shortly
took
vigorous
steps
to
consolidate
the
supreme
power.
In the Parliament held at Perth 30th September 1426
:
It is ordanit be the King ande the Parliament that everilk lorde hafande landis

When the King came to Inverness in 1427 to repress the
turbulence of the Highland chiefs, he, according to Fordun,
composed the well-known distich
:
Ad turrira fortem ducamus caute cohortem
;
Per Christi sortem, mernerunt hi quia mortem.
(Let us cautiously lead an army to the strong citadel
;
By the fate of Christ these have merited death.)
According to Fordun, the King at this time
Caused to be arrested Alexander
of the

his son-in-law,
leader
of two thousand, John Koss, William
Lesly, Angus de
Moravia, and Mackmakcn (Matheson) leaders of two thousand
; and also other
lawless catcrans and great captains in proportion, to the number of about fifty.
Alexander Makgorrie
of Garmoran (sou of Godfrey Macdonald, Lord
of Uist),
leader of a thousand men, and John MacArthur
(of
the family of Campbell),
a great chief among his own clan, and the leader of a thousand and more, were
convicted, and being adjudged to death were beheaded.
There James Cambel
was hung, being accused and convicted of the slaughter of John of the Isles (John
Mor, first of the Macdonalds of
Isla. )
The rest were sent here and there to the
dift'erent castles of the noblemen throughout the kingdom, and were afterwards
condemned to different kinds
of death, and some were set at liberty.
From the Rolls of the Great Chamberlains of Scotland we
obtain the following glimpses of this period, 1425-1429

King James was again
at
Inverness
in
the month
of
August
1428, as
is seen from
his having granted
to
the
town
the
following
charter,
dated
at
Inverness, the 28th
day of August 1428
;
James, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to the Provost and Bailies of our
Burgh
of Inverness
; Greeting
: Whereas on the part of the burgesses
of our
Bargh of
Inverness, it has reached our ears by way of common complaint, that
some persons dwelling within the bounds and liberty of said burgh usurp and
infringe
its
liberty and
privilege, by buying and selling merchandise or
other
saleable goods, beyond the said burgh, to the no small loss and prejudice
of our
said burgh
: Therefore, we strictly command and charge you, that in the accus-
tomed places of
the said burgh and
liberties thereof, ye cause
to be
publicly
proclaimed, by our authority, that those inhabiting all and singular the bounds
of the
said burgh and liberty
thereof, who have any merchandise or goods
whatsoever to be sold, shall assemble at the market place of our said burgh for
selling them, and shall actually present themselves there as in our other burghs
and their
liberties, as the custom
is and
as
is observed within our kingdom
:
That if they shall not obey our commands in
the
premises, we will and ordain
that all merchandise and goods of the foresaid description thus afterwards bought
and sold beyond our burgh, be fully escheated, confiscated, and specially retained
by you, under our authority, for our use and benefit
: "Whereupon we, by these
presents, commit
to you and each of you, conjunctly and
severally, our power
and authority
:
Given under the testimonial of our great seal at Inverness, the
28th day of August, in the twenty-third year of our reign (1428).

JAMES
I.
1406-1437.
PART THIRD AND LAST.
It is probable that Fordun was in error in fixing the King's
visit
to Inverness in 1427.
The MS. History of the Mack-
intoshes makes it 1428, and
relates the same events thus—
" In 1428 the King came to Inverness to administer justice
and suppress such
depredations.
Most of the
leaders
of
these robbers were taken
into custody, some of them gave
sureties and were dismissed home, some were retained
in
confinement, and
the
rest
suffered
the
stroke
of
justice.
When the power and fidelity of Malcolm Mackintosh became
famous among
his
neighbours,
the
garrison
of Inverness
was committed to his charge, an office his
predecessors liad
long held."
The historian goes on to state,
^' At that time,
Alexander
of the
Isles,
Earl
of Ross
(son
of Donald of
Harlaw),
for many
atrocities and
cruelties which he
per-
petrated, was
seized
at Inverness and conveyed
to
Perth.
His friends, however, prevailed upon the King to grant him
his
liberty.
But
as soon
as he was home, he
collected a
band of men accustomed to live by rapine, fell upon Inver-
ness, pillaged and burnt
the houses, and then besieged the
fort
itself.
But
in
vain, for
it was gallantly defended by
the bravery and vigour
of the
Governor, and Alexander,
understanding
that an
assault was
meditated
upon him,
retired
precipitately
towards Lochaber.
These events
fell
out in 1429."
What occurred in Lochaber
is thus narrated by Fordun
:
— "Accordingly, though
the Lord King was informed that
the Lord
of the
Isles when
set
before him had
pursued
courses that were not proper while he was his own master,
he warned him, however, frequently and wisely to change
his conduct to better, and to refrain from licentious proceed-
ings, and so behave for the future towards the King and his
lieges as to merit therefor to obtain
his greater favour, and
be reckoned among his special retinue.
As he promised to
behave well in future the King gave him his liberty, calling
to mind one of the memorable words of Valerius, who said,
—
^ If it
is glorious
to overcome an enemy,
it
is not
less
praiseworthy to know to compassionate the unhappy
; because
though warlike valour merits
infinite
glory, yet clemency
great
love.'
Thereafter the said Lord of the
Isles having
returned home, followed the advice of the baser sort, and in
o

106
INVERNESSIANA.
contempt burnt the royal town of Inverness.
The King wa3
greatly incensed because of this, gathered an army in the
year of the Lord 1429, and on a certain moor in Lochaber
on the vigil of the Nativity of St John the Baptist, routed
the said Alexander, who had with him upwards of
10,000
men of Ross and the Isles, where, when the King's standard
was
unfurled, two tribes
forsook him—viz., those of Clan
Katan and Clan Cameron, and arrayed themselves under the
King's command.
On the Feast of Palms following,
the
tribe of Clan
fcatan killed in a certain church nearly the
whole race of Clan Cameron."
The latter occurrence is thus referred to in the Mackintosh
History
:
" In the following year 1430, a keen dispute arose
between the tribes (Clan Chattan and Clan Cameron) at the
celebration of a festival.
Their minds were highly inflamed,
a violent engagement followed.
Many of the Clan Chattan
fell, and the Camerons were almost extirpated."
The Mackintosh History proceeds to relate, " On the day
following
our
Lord's
resurrection
the
before-mentioned
Alexander Earl of Ross threw
himself in the power
and
implored mercy of the King, while he was in the Temple of
the Holy Cross celebrating the sacred worship.
The Queen
and other nobles
that were present entreated the King on
his behalf.
He was
sent to the Prison of Tantallon, where
he was confined
till October of that year.
In that month
James II. was born, and during the public rejoicing Alex-
ander was pardoned, along with some others of the nobility
who had incurred the Sovereign's displeasure."
On the day preceding his granting the charter to the Town
of Inverness quoted in
last chapter, the King granted the
following remission
to several of the Clan
Chattan.
This
remission has been already published in the Kilravock papers,
but
as
it
is dated
at Inverness and contains several
local,
names, it is here given
:
Bemission for Dominic Grogick and 25 with him.
James, by tlie Grace of God, King of Scots, to all his good men to whom the
present
letters
shall come
; Greeting
: Know that we have remitted to Dominic
Grogych, Dominic

homicides, rapines, thefts, burnings, or other transgressions of whatsoever kind
foresaid, any hurt, molestation, injury, or
loss, or from visiting them or any of
them with death, under the pain of loss of life and limbs
:
In testimony of which
matter, we have caused these present letters to endu.re for
all time, to be made
liatent under our great seal for foresaid persons.
At Inverness, the 27th day of
the month of August, in the year of our reign the 23d.
This remission
to con-
tinue, i)rovided the forewritten persons are of the true alliance and following of
Angus and Malcolm M'lntosche, and are not under our arrest.
From the conflagrations and destructions tlie town under-
went betwixt the years 1400 and
1430,
it
is little wonder
that but few documents of the period remain.
The following
presentation by the burgesses and community to the chap-
laincy of the Holy Cross
is, however,
still extant
:
To the reverend father in Christ and our Lord, Lord Andrew, by the Grace
of God,
and
of
the Apostolic
See, Bishop of Moray,
we, the
burgesses and
community of the burgh
of Inverness, give the reverence and honour due
: For
the chaplaincy of the Holj'' Cross, belonging of clear right to our presentation,
and your fatherly collation, now in our hands, by the resignation of Lord Henry
Dyngvale,
chaplain
thereof, by the
tenor
of these
presents, we present
our
discreet and
distinguished
cleric, Thomas Levynsthon,
to your fatherhood for
foresaid chaplaincy, and we humbly beg and entreat that said chaplaincy of the
Holy Cross, resigned as is aforesaid, be conferred by your ordinary authority upon
the said Master Thomas,
the presentee, or on his procurator, and that you pro-
vide him or his procu.rator in his name with the same, and induct and invest him
with the real, actual, and
corporal possession
of the
rights and pertinents of
the same, and when inducted and invested, that you defend him, and do all
other things that are proper ar.d which
it
belongs
to you and
your
ordinary
and pastoral
office to do
:
In testimony of which
matter, we have
caused our
common seal to be appended to these
i:)resents.
At said burgh, on the 9th day
of the month of December, in the year of the Lord 1429.
Upon 11th February 1431, an inquest is held at Inverness
as to the tenure by which the lands of Kilravock are held.
The following entries appear
in
the chamberlain
rolls of
1434
and
1435
: — Account

to the date of
this account, and likewise for the three years
included in this account.
They charge themselves first with
£5 7s 5d for
arrears of their
last account, as
is
clear from
the end
thereof.
The sum
of arrears is clear.

without arrears is £117 13s 8Jd ; do. with arrears, £123 Os 13d.
In 1434, there is owing £25, which is for the fine imposed
upon tlie burgesses of Aberdeen because they did not cause
victuals
to
be
conveyed
to
Inverness, which
fine depends
upon the king's pleasure.
This year (1435) the chamberlain charges himself with the
exits of various burghs in connection with ^^Iter Camerarii."

Upon the 6th of November
1436,
Christiana Makferry
/
sold to the community of Inverness
the piece of ground at
the corner of Bridge Street and Church Street, whereon the
Tolbooth
stood, by the following charter which
is endorsed
'' Ye Charter of ye Tolbuth
: "—

Duncan Makfery, burgess of Inverness

made by me in the hands of the

my present charter confirmed to the burgesses and community of foresaid burgh,
one particate of my land lying in Bridge Street, on the north side of the said
street, between my land at the north on the one
side, and the
King's common
highway at the south on the other, whose front extends beyond Church Street
at the east, and the back to the land of Donald Sutor towards the west, for true
value
to me in reckoned money given and entirely paid; which land, with the
pertinents my said late father in his legitimate power
(liege poustie)
of
his
own conquest publicly in face of court, by resignation made of his own accord,
bestowed upon and invested me with, by sasine obtained
:
To be had and held,
the
said particate of land with the pertinents, by the foresaid
burgesses and
community
of
the
said burgh and their
successors, who for the

shall
be, of me, my heirs and assignees for ever in feu and heritage, and free burgage,

soever, both named, and not named,
belonging to said land, or which may in
future justly belong, as freely, wholly,
fully, honourably, well, and in peace, as
any land in the kingdom of Scotland is given and granted

and for ever defend, the foresaid particate of land, with the pertinents in, and
by all ways
as
aforesaid, to the foresaid
bui-gesses and community and their
successors
:
In testimony of which matter because I have no seal of my own, I
have with instance procured the common seal of the prior and convent of the
preaching Friars of said burgh, together with the
seal of "Walter Andrew,
and
caused them
to be appended
to
this
writ at
said
burgh, the 6th day of the
month of November, in the year of the Lord 1430.
The witnesses being Lords,
John perpetual vicar of said burgh, John de Mu^nroo, John "Walter,
chaplains,
with many others, to the premises specially called and requested.
Upon the 4th of September 1437, Alexander de Yle, who
claimed the earldom of Ross through his mother, made the
following donation
to the Prior and
Friars
of
Inverness.
This annual was with others transferred at the Reformation
to the magistrates of Inverness, and, we understand, it still
forms part of the revenues of the burgh
:
To all the faithful to whose knowledge the present letters
shall come, Alex-
ander de He, Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles
; Greeting eternal in the Lord ;
Know, that we, for the salvation of our soul, and for the salvation
of the souls
of our father,
ancestors, and successors, have given, granted, and by this pre-
sent writ confirmed to the religioiTs men, the prior and friars of the Dominican
Preachers of Inverness, twenty
shillings
of annual rent,
of
the usual money
of
the kmgdom of
Scotland, to be paid annually
at two terms in
the
year,
viz., of Pentecost and St Martin's, by equal j)ortions of our land and ferry of
Easter Kessock,* with the pertinents in pure and perpetual charity, as freely as
any annual rent is given and granted to any other religious men in the kingdom
of
Scotland
: In
testimony
of which matter we have caused our
seal
to
be
appended at Inverness the 4th day of the month of September, in the year of the
Lord 1437.
These, with many others, being witnesses,
viz.,
Torquil M'Loyde,
Lord of Leyvhous (Lewis), George Munro of Foulis, Alexander M'CuUach, and
Lord Beane.
On 17th July 1439, Agnes, daughter of Nicolaus Peddock^
late burgess of Inverness, with consent and assent of Michael
Thomson, her spouse, and also of her nearest heirs and their
friends,
sells
to Andrew
Rede, burgess
of
said burgh
of
Inverness,
that annual rent of three
shillings, due
to her
from a certain particate of land lying in
said burgh in the
Church Street thereof, on the east side of the same, between
the land of the
late Bartholomew, son of William, at the
north on
the one side, and the common vennel of our lord
the king at the south on the other
; also that annual rent of
12d, belonging
to her, from
a certain acre of land lying in
the Damysdale, between the land of Andrew of Kinloss at
the west on the one side, and the land of the said Andrew
on the east on the other, for true value, &c.
'' In testimony
of which thing,
as
I had no
seal
of my own,
I and my
husband
have procured with
instance and
caused
to
be
appended
to this writ the seals of Donald Faber and Hugh

sterling is payable by the Estate of Redcastle to the burgh for lands at Kessock.

Nicolaus Man, and for the greater security of this matter we
have with instance procured the common seal of said burgh,
also to be appended.

In a convention held
this year at Stirling at the instance
of Sir Alexander Livingston of Callander, to cover his illegal
acts, there appeared representatives of the clergy and nobility,
and according
to Tytler
that
there might
at
least be an
appearance of the presence of a third estate, James of Parcle,
commissary of Linlithgow, William
Cranston, burgess and
commissary of Edinburgh, and Andrew
Reid, burgess and
commissary of Inverness, were present as representatives of
the burghs, and sanctioned by
their
seals
the transaction
which took
place.
This
is the first time, it
is understood,
so far as the records are known to .exist, of a representative
from Inverness attending Parliament, but that they did so
on prior occasions can hardly admit of doubt.
In 1440 the name of Waus, so long and honourably con-
nected with
Inverness, appears for the first time in a deed
by John Bathane, heir of the late Thomas Bathane, burgess
of Inverness, who sells
to his cousin Alexander Waus, and
Janet, his spouse, and
their
heirs and assignees, an annual
rent of 3s of the usual money of Scotland, of one particate
of land lying in
the
Dymisdale
Street,
on the west
side
thereof, which
lies between the land
of the
late Magnus
Sartor at the south on the one part, and the common vennel
at the north on the other, whose front extends to the King's
common
highway towards
the
east, and
the back
to
the
ridge of the Castle Hill towards
the west, &c.
" In
testi-
mony of which,
since

Alexander de He had the earldom of Ross formally con-
ferred upon him by James L, and in the minority of his son
the second James, the Estates of Scotland appointed Alex-
ander justiciar of the Kingdom benorth the Forth.
Upon
the 17th August 1442, Alexander grants
at Inverness the
following precept of sasine in favour of William Thane of
Cawdor
:
Alexander de lie, Earl of Ross, Lord of the
Isles, and Justiciar of the part
north of the water of Forth, to John
Grant, Sheriff-Depute of
Inverness, our
bailie
in
this
part
; Greeting
:
Since, by inquest made by ovir command and
retoured
to our
chapel, it
is found
that
the
late Donald
of
Caldor,
father
of "William of Caldor, bearer of these presents, died last vest and seized as of feu
at the peace and faith of our Lord the King, of the lands of the Thanage
of
Caldor with the pertinents, and the offices of Sheriff of Nairn and constabulary
thereof, with the
tax
of beer and fish, together with the annual rent
of
six
merks
of Balmakath, and of the lands
of Both and Banchre with pertinents,
and of the lands of the half
of Rate, together with the mill thereof, with perti-
nents lying in the Earldom of Moray, within the Sheriffdom of Nairn

INVERNESSIANA.
Gordon, styled
as early as 1421, Alexander de Seton, Lord
of Gordon, who was created Earl of Huntly in 1449, regard-
ing the lands of Kynedward, as appears from the register of
Aberdeen.
Alexander, Earl of Ross, married Elizabeth, only daughter
of Sir Alexander Seton, by his wife, heiress of Gordon.
The
Countess of Ross was
sister of the above mentioned Alex-
ander, first Earl of Huntly, and had two daughters, Margaret,
married to John, Earl of Sutherland; and Florence, married
to Mackintosh.
As the power of the Earls of Ross and Lords
of the Isles waned and sunk, that of the Gordons from this
period rose rapidly.
George, second Earl of Huntly, through
whom
the
line was continued, was only a younger son of
Earl Alexander, having succeeded by special destination in
bis father's patent.
The following charter in favour of Andrew Reid, referred
to
in
a
previous
chapter
of
subjects
in
Church
Street,
Inverness, is dated 17th August 1443
:
To all who shall see or hear of this charter, Maurice Kerde and Donald Moray,
tutors of Catherine, daughter of Duncan Goldsmyt, late burgess in Inverness
;
Greeting eternal in the Lord
: Know that we, with consent and assent of Evote
Stewart, husband
of the
said
Catherine,
and
of
the
other
relatives
of
the
parents,
both on
the
father's
side
and
the mother's, have
given,
granted,
alienated, and by title
of
sale
sold, and by this our present charter confirmed
to our beloved Andrew Rede, bux-gess of
said burgh, all that particate of
land,
with the
pertinents
lying within the burgh of Inverness, in the Church Street
thereof, on the east side of said street, as
it extends
itself in length from
the
King's common highway of said Church
Street towards the
west,
to the old
ditch towards
the
east, between the land of the foresaid Andrew, on the south
on the one part, and the land of Morice Stewart,
at
the
north
on the
other,
for
a
certain sum of money,
&c,, &c:
Giving therefor yearly, to our
lord the
King, the service used and wont, and to the heirs of William Pilche, late Lord
of Garty,
or his assignees,
2s at two terms
in
the
year, &c
:
In testimony of
which thing, because we had no seals of our own, we, Maurice and Donald, in
name
of
the said Catherine, have with instance, procured the seals of Ronald
Clerk and Thomas Tailzeour, two of the bailies of
said burgh, to be appended
to these presents, and for the greater evidence of the matter and knowledge of
the premises, the foresaid Evote
Stewart, husband of the
said
Catherine, for
himself and the other
family
relatives,
as he had no seal of
his own, with
instance, procured to be appended to this charter the
seal
of Donald Faber,
burgess
of
said burgh, and likewise we, both with one
assent, have procured
the common seal of said burgh to be appended to this charter.
At
said
burgh,

Thomas
Cuthbert, Hugh
Clerk,
James Johnson, Robert Nicolson,
Sandy Waus, and William Buthe, and divers others.
In the foregoing deed
the name of William de Bught
appears as a witness, and in the following he is the grantee.
This William appears to have possessed a great deal of land.
His surname is
doubtful.
It
is curious to find such a low-
land term as Bught, by old people called
'^ The Bught,"
in
the north at so early a period.
In the Scottish laoguage it
is perfectly descriptive of the locality.
The Gaelic name is

INVERNESSIANA.
113
Kill-a-vean, synonymous with Tor-a-vean.
The Saint here
indicated is probably Baitan or Baothin, cousin and succes-
sor of Coluim Cille
Baetini ard Aingleach
Coluim Cille Caindleach.
Their anniversary was the same, the 9th June.
Archibald,
Earl of Moray, referred to was brother to the Earl of Douglas,
killed by James II., who was himself forfeited in the year
1452.

To all who shall see or hear of this charter, Donald of the Old Castle, Lord of
that Ilk
; Greeting eternal in the Lord
: Know that I, with consent and assent of
the great and
potent
Lord Archibald de Douglas, Earl of Moray, have given,
granted, and by deed
of
sale,
have
given, and
alienated from me and my
heirs for ever, to my beloved William de Buyche (Bught), burgess of Inverness,
five acres of my land lying in the lordship of the old
Castle, four of which lie
together near the Bradstane twixt the land of the Blessed Virgin Mary on both
sides, both on
the south and
north, and
the
fifth
acre
of land
lies near the
stream
of Scourburn, as foresaid burn runs towards
the south, and my own.
land
towai-ds the north on the other, for a
certain sum of money given and
fully paid to me in my pressing necessity
:
To be held and had, the foresaid
five
acres
of
land,
with the
pertinents,
by the
foresaid
William,
his
heirs
and assignees of me, my heirs and assignees,
in feu and heritage for
ever, by
all
their old and
right marches
and
divisions,
with
all
their commodities,
liberties, and
easements, and just pertinents
whatsoever, as well not named as
named, belonging to said acres of land, with the pertinents, or which, in future
can in any way belong, freely, quietly, wholly, fully, and honourably, well and
in
peace,
without revocation for ever
:
Giving
therefor
yearly the foresaid
William, his heirs and
assignees, to me and my
heirs, two pence
of the usual
money of Scotland, in name of blench farm if asked, in lieu of all other burden,
secular
service,

the pertinents
in, and by
all ways
as
is
foresaid
to
the
foresaid
William,

; of which five acres, with the pertinents, I have given to the foresaid
William,
sasine
and hereditary
state with
effect,
reserving
all rights
as the
custom is
:
In testimony of which thing I have caused my seal to be appended
to
this my present charter
:

of
Inverness, on the 14th day of
the month of April, in the year of the Lord 1447
:
The witnesses being—John

with many others called and specially asked.
XLIIL
JAMES
II.
1437-1460,
PART THIRD.
In a deed signed at Inverness on the 20th July 1440, the
following
are
witnesses—Thomas
Eraser, Lord of Lovat;
Sir
Walter
Ogilvie,
knight;
William
Leslie,
Sheriff
of
Inverness.
In 1442 is found the name of John Grant, SherifP-Depute
of Inverness.
p

114
INVERNESSIANA.
In the year 1448, the name is first recorded of Robertson
of Tnshes, so long and
closely connected with the town of
Inverness.
The
deed
is
granted
by
John
Robertson,
tlie
first in the north who
took
that surname,
probably
following the example of his
relative,
the
first Baron
of
{Strowan, who in 1437 was called Robert Reoch Duncan son.
The
Robertsons
are
called
Clan
Donachy, from
their
ancestor, Duncan de Atholia, and it seems obvious that the
granter of the deed was a grandson of the founder, and uncle
of the first Baron of Strowan.
The well-known poet and fighting man, the prototype of
the Baron
of Bradwardine, was
Alexander
Robertson
of
Strowan, who figured in the risings of 1688, 1715, and 1745.
If poets are generally scribblers, Strowan must have used up
much paper, for his writing is not smaller than what is termed
half-text.
In a curious letter to John Robertson of Inshes,
in the year 1734, he thus expresses himself:
Hermitage, November 2d, 1734.
Dear
Sir,—You
certainly have heard how I am opposed by some very little
fellows
of my name
: All the
considerable
part
of my family have
declared
their abhorrence to the recreants of their chief
: They have done me that honour,
and I should be at a great loss if Inches's subscription did not corroborate their
friendly
and
just
sentiments.
I have sent
their
declaration with my good
friend John
Robertson of Balnagard,
not
doubting but
you'll
join
with
so
honourable a crowd, which,
till I have the joy of seeing you, will give me the
greatest
satisfaction.
If your son will do me the same honour I shall be glad,
and will defer further explanations
till
I have the pleasure of embracing you,
as being with a true heart,— Dear Sir, your affectionate cousin and servant,
A. EOBERTSON OF StROWAN.
In the deed
after quoted, John Robertson grants on the
20th April 1448, a particate of his land on the east side of
Castle Street, to William
Michael.
The locality is known,
as a very ancient gateway still remains on that other half of
Inshes property in the same neighbourhood which remained
with them until last century
:
To all who shall see or hear of this charter, John Robertson, son and heir of
the
late
Robert,
son
of
Duncan,
burgess
of
Inverness
;
Greeting
eternal in
the Lord
: Know that I have given, granted, and by title of
sale, delivered and
set in feu farm, and also by my present chai^tei', confirmed to my beloved "William
Michael,
burgess
of Inverness, one particate
of my
land and
burgage,
lying
within
said burgh, in
the
Dyraingisdale on the
eastern
side thereof, between
my land at the south on the one
side, and the land of Alexander Man at the
north on the other
; whose front extends to the King's common highway towards
the west, and the back to the land of Thomas Cuthbert at the east
: To be held
and had, said whole particate of land, with the pertinents, by the said "William, his
heirs, and
assignees,
of me, my
heirs, and
assignees, for ever, freely, quietly,
wholly,
honourably,
well
and
in
peace, with
all commodities,

said
lands,_ with
the pertinents as
well named

and to our Lord the King five pence, to be paid at the terms appointed within
said
burgh
: And
I,
the
said John, my
heirs, and
assignees,
shall
warrant,
acquit, and for ever defend, said particate of land, with the pertinents, to the
foresaid William ]\lichael, his heirs, and assignees, in and by all means as is fore-
said, and against all mortal men and women
: And if it happen that I, my heirs,
or assignees, contravene this my assedation, or revoke
it
in any way,
I oblige
me, my
heirs, and
assignees, in
ten pounds of usual Scots money, to be fully
paid toward the
fabric of the Parish Church of Inverness before any step in
law, the present charter, however,
to endure for ever by
its own strength
: In
testimony
of which
thing,
as
I had no
seal
of my
own,
I have with
great
instance procured and caused to be appended to my jiresent charter, the seals
of the prudent men Thomas Cuthbert and Alexander Man,
burgesses of said
burgh
:
And
for the greater
security
of
this
matter,
I
have
with instance
procured and causetl to be appended to this my charter, the seal of the discreet
man Andrew Grame, one of the bailies of said burgh, who for me gave sasine
of said land
: At said burgh,
the
20th
day
of
the month
of
April,
in the
year of the Lord 1448
: Witnesses— Patrick Fergusane, Walter Johnson, Richard
Hoge, John Thomson, jun., John Gray, and John Williamson, with many others.
We shall hereafter have cause again to refer to the family
of lushes and to trace their descent, but meantime conclude
by an extract from the Session records as to the pulpit in the
<jraelic Church, which, coming
to
the Robertsons through
intermarriage with the families of Vans
of Easter Inshes *
and
Sinclair of
Rattar,
was
gifted
to
the
church.
It
is
termed a " little desk," and came from Holland.
It will be
observed
that Inshes
was
to have two pews
in
return
in
heritage for ever.
Inshes' mother, described as the posses-
sor of the desk, was
Janet
Sinclair, and
it
was
she who
erected
the singularly handsome burial place of the family
of Inshes near the Church-yard gate
:
At Inverness, the first day of August, one thousand six hundred and seventy-
six
years—The
said day there was
a supplication presented by Mr William
Robertson of Inches, making
his humble
address to the session of Inverness,
regretting his inconvenience for himself and family in the High Church
of the
said burgh,
for the reverend and incumbent attention of the
said ordinances,
desiring he might be licensed and impowered to cause build and erect two sufficient
pews next
to the
Guildiy's desk,
whereuj)on which
supi^lication,
after
ripe
and grave advisement, was found very reasonable, and knowing him to be a de
serving person
; The whole members
of the
session did unanimously grant the
said two pews and thereby,
to inherit and enjoy them peaceably and quietly
in all times coming, without any controlling, questioning, or backcalling thereof
:
But to remain in his possession as an undoubted heritage
: For which two pews
the said Mr William did give the little desk belonging some time to his mother,
and to be given to Hugh Robertson, treasurer, and James Cuthbert, late bailie
;
Ordaining these presents to be
insert and registered
in
the
principal Session
Register of the said burgh,
therein to remain for the future
security and pre-
servation thereof.
Extracted by me,
(Signed)
John Innes, Clerk to the Session.
* There
are three Vasses and one Cuthbert, very
respectable people, genuine old
re^identers, now
living in Inverness, but being all females, there
is every
prospect of
these surnames, once so cumiaon and influential in Inverness, becoming extinct.

JAMES
II.
1437-1460. PART FOURTH.
Upon the 2 2d of January 1449, in a Parliament held at
Edinburgh, King James confirms
his Queen's dowry and
sets forth whence derived.
Among other sources of income
she has
'' The Lordships
of Brechin, Badenoch, and Aber-
nethy, the great custom of the burgh of Perth with the rents
of the same, the Castle of Inverness with the great custom
and rents of the burgh of Inverness."
Upon the 13th of August 1449, John de Yle, who had in
this
year
succeeded
his
father
Alexander,
Earl
of
Ross,
granted at Inverness a charter to the Master of Sutherland,
of which the essentials are now quoted
:
To all who shall see or hear of this charter, John de Yle, Earl of Koss and Lord
of the
Isles
; Greeting
eternal in the Lord
:
Know
all that we ha,ve given,
granted, and by this our present charter confirmed
to our beloved cousin, Alex-
ander de Sutherland of Dunbeth, all and sundry the lands of Easter Kindeace,
with the pertinents lying in our Earldom of Ross, within the Sheriffdom of Inver-
ness, for
his homage and faithful
service
:
Which lands belonged to the late
Thomas de Fentoune
of
Ogil,
and which
said Thomas ....
resigned
....
To be had and held the said lands of Easter Kindeace, with the perti-
nents, by the
foresaid Alexander de Sutherland, his heirs and assignees, of us
and our
successors,
Earls
of Ross, in
feu and heritage
for
ever, by all
right
marches, ancient and devised, in woods and plains ....
hunting, hawk-
ing,
fishing, and
fowling ....
In
testimony of which
thing we have
caused our seal to
be appended to our present
charter, at
Inverness the 13th
day of the month of August, in the year of the Lord 1449, there being present,
John Stewart, Lord of Lorn
; Lachlan M'Gilleoin of Dowarde
; John Murchardi
M'Gilleoin of Fynschenys
; John Lachlan M'Gilleoin of CoUa
;
William, Thane
of Cawdor
; Master Thomas Lochmalony,
chancellor
of
the church of Ross
;
Andrew Reede, Provost
of the burgh of Inverness
; and Alexander Flemmyng
of Perth, with divers others called in testimony.
In 1449, for the first time, is found any charter or deed
connected with
Inverness, written
in the language of the
country.
All deeds prior
to this date, referred
to in these
papers, are written
either in the Latin
or Norman-French
languages.
Exact copies
of two deeds
are here given, so
that the language and spelling then used may be noted.
The first
is a charter
of alienation by Andrew Graham,
burgess of Inverness, with consent of Elizabeth, his
wife,
daughter of Donald, and Donald his son and heir, in favour
f William of B Light, of an
acre of land in
the Gairbread,
dated 20th July 1449.
The lands of Gairbread are to the
north-east of the town beyond Rose Street

There is some doubt as
to where this rood
lay.
The Ship-Flat
is generally under-
stood to have lain on the east side of the river banks.
The
Chapel of the Green, one of the bounds, lay on the Green of
Muirtown,
or
'^ Muckle Green,"
on
the west
side
of the
river.
At the present time Mr Matheson, M.P., pays a feu
of 12s 7d for the following lands, viz., those of the Chaplainry
of the Green, part of Merkinch and Planefield.
The explanation may be that at this early period, as most
of the waters of the Ness found
their way to the sea by the
Abban, the
Ship-Flat extended
to both
sides of the then
estuary
:

JAMES
II.
1437-1460,
PART FIFTH.
The following charter of half an
acre of land in Domes-
dale,
was
granted
by
John
Thomas
Foyre,
burgess
of
Inverness,
to Andrew
Reid,
so
frequently named, and
is
dated 3d August 1450 :—
To all who shall see or hear of this Charter, John Thome Foyre, burgess of
Inverness
; Greeting eternal in the Lord
: Know that I have given, granted, and
by title
of sale
delivered,
and
also by my
present Charter
confirmed, to
the
honourable man Andrew Rede, burgess
of said burgh, one half acre of
arable
land, lying within the eastern part of the plain, " lie Damysdale" of said burgh,
between the land of Donald Tailzour on the
east
side on the one
part, and the
land of Alexander Man on the west on the other, whose front extends to the
King's common highway towards the south, and the back to the land of the
Altar of the Holy Cross towards the north, for a certain sum
of money
fully
counted and paid into my hands
: To be held and had the said whole half acre
of land with the pertinents by the foresaid Andrew, his heirs and assignees, of
me my heirs and assignees, for ever,
freely,
quietly, wholly, honourably, well,
and in peace,
with
all commodities,
liberties, and easements, and
their just
pertinents whatsoever, as well not named as named, belonging to said land with the
pertinents or which may in future in any way iustly belong
: And I the said John,

INVERNESSIANA.
119
\
my heirs and assignees, shall warrant, acquit, and for ever defend said half acre
of land with the pertinents to the foresaid Andrew, his heirs and
assignees,
in
and by all means as is foresaid against all mortal men and women
:
And if it
happen that I, ray heirs, executors or assignees, contravene this my sale or revoke
it in anyway, I oblige me, my heirs, executors, and assignees, in £10 of the usual
money of Scotland, to be fully paid toward
the work of
the Parish
Church
of
Invei'ness, before any step whatsoever of law, the present charter, however, shall
endure for ever by its own strength.
In testimony of which matter my
seal
is appended to the present charter,
and for the
greater security of this matter
I
liave
with
great instance procured and caused to be appended to my present
charter the seal
of the
discreet man
William Tawson,
one
of
the
bailies of
said burgh, who for me gave sasine of said land to the foresaid Andrew, reserving,
liowever, the rights
of
parties, together with the common seal of the
foresaid
burgh.
At said bvirgh, the 3d day of the month
of August,
in the year of the
Lord I-ISO. "Witnesses— Hugh Clerk, John Gravnt, Walter Thome, John Pilche,
Thomas
Angusson,
and John
Vaus,
with many
others
called and
specially
requested.
Tytler, quoting the Auckinleck
Chronicle, narrates under
the date of 1451
:
The Earl of Ross, who died in 1449, had transmitted to his eldest son John, his
treason along with his title
; and the new
earl, who was connected by marriage
with the
Livingstons,
broke
ovit into rebellion, and seized the royal castles of
Inverness, Urquhart, andRuthven in Badenoch.
This last place he immediately
demolished
; tlrquhart was committed
to
Sir James Livingstone, who, on the
first^news of Ross's rebellion, had escaped from theEling's
court to thejiigh-
Jands^
' whilst Inverness
castle was supplied with military
stores and strongly
''garrisoned.
The Mackintosh MS.
History on this point
states, " In
the
year
1451, when Malcolm
Mackintosh was worn out
with age, and John Earl of Ross, his
friend, in a
state of
rebellion, James
II. gave the command of the garrison of
Inverness
to one
called
Crichton, whom the same Earl
of
Ross
afterwards
threw
out
of
it
by stratagem."
Tytler
further records under date 1452
:
James promoted to the
office of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom the Earl
of Huntly, committing to his assured loyalty and experience in war the task of
putting down
the rebellion
of
Crawford and Ross,
and empowering him
to
promise to all who came forward to join the royal standard an ample indemnity
for past offences, as well as to those who continued firm in their original loyalty
the most
substantial marks
of
the
favour of
the Crown.
.Huntly,
in
the
execution
of
his new
office,
instantly
raised
a
large
force
in
the
northern
counties
; and having displayed the royal banner, encountered the Earl of Craw-
ford, surnamed " The Tiger," on a level moor beside the town of Brechin and
gave him a total defeat.
The action was fought with detennined bravery on both
sides, and, although Huntly
far outnumbered
his opponents, for a long time
proved doubtful.
Huntly's two brothers, Sir William and Sir Henry Seton,
fell at Brechin.
Upon the
forfeiture of the Earl of Douglas, his brother
the Earl of Moray, and of John Earl of Ross shortly after,
the following lands were annexed to the Crown
:
The castles and lordships
of Inverness and Urquhart, with the water-mails
or rents due for the fishings of Inverness
;
the lordships of Abernethy, and the
several baronies
of
Urquhart, Glen-orchane, Bonnechen, Bonochar, Annache,
Edderdail, otherwise
called Ardmanache, Petty, Brachly, and Strathern
; and,
lastly, the Redcastle with the lordships in the county of Ross which are attached
to
it.

On the 20th May 1451, Andrew Reid, Burgess of Inver-
ness, whose name appears in
so many deeds, and who had
filled the offices
of Provost and Commissary of Inverness,
with consent of his
spouse, Marjory Grant, presents a dis-
creet man. Lord Thomas de Tayn, to the perpetual chaplainry
of the altar of St
Catherine, within
the Parish Church of
Inverness, and humbly entreats John, Bishop of Moray, to
admit the presentee
to foresaid presentation by delivery to
him of his
ring, and that he command the
rural dean
to
induct and invest the presentee in corporal and real posses-
V
sion of said chaplainry, with the pertinents.
Given under
his seal, at Inverness, on the day on which he made his will,
viz., 20th
day
of May
1451.
Whereupon
the
Bishop
of
Moray issued the following order and precept
:
To
all and sundry sons
of Holy Mother Clmrch, to whose knowledge these
present letters shall come, John, by the grace of God, and of the Apostolic See,
Bishop of Moray
;
G-reeting,
in him who
is the true
salvation
of
all
: Know,
that we for the praise and glory of God omnipotent, the Holy Mother Mary,
St
Catherine
the
Virgin, and
of
all saints, have created,
and
by pontifical
authority
of new have erected a perpetual chaplaincy in the Parish Church of
Inverness, to the altar of St Catherine in the same, for one chaj)lain
to perform
there for
ever
divine worship for the souls of the most
serene
prince and our
lord. Lord James, by divine clemency King of Scots, and of Queen Mary, his spouse,
and for the
souls of the late Andrew Reid, burgess of Inverness, and Marjory
Grant, his spouse, and for the souls of their predecessors and successors, and of
all the faithful dead, to which chaplaincy we attach by said authority and for ever
unite
all and sundry lands, tenements, acres, crofts, and annual rents acquired
by their own conquest by the said
late Andrew and Marjory and assigned
to
said chaplaincy, both lying within and without said burgh, according as in our
other
letters made thereupon, and
specially
expressed, and
also contained in
the register of our Church
is more
fully contained, which
chaplaincy, with all
its
rights and
pertinents, on the request and devout
supplication of the
said
Marjory, and from
a sense
of love, we bestow upon
the
discreet man. Lord
Thomas
of Tayn,
presbyter, and
with the same
also provide him,
and have
inducted and presently invested him therewith by delivery of our
ring, and by
committing specially to him the cure and administration thereof in things spiritual
and temporal, which chaplain and all chaplains
his
successors for
ever
in said
chaplaincy, we will and appoint to be bound with the other perpetual chaplains
of
said church
similarly
engaged,
and bound,
to perform the
service
of the
blessed Virgin Mary every Saturday in
ecclesiastical garb, with
note in
said
church, and
also
at
vespers on Sundays, and at the
greater mass and
second
vespers on
all Sundays and festivals, and the
six holidays at the
altar
of the
Holy Cross iu foresaid Church
: We therefore commit to you, the dean of our
Christianity
of Inverness, in
virtue
of your sacred obedience by the tenor
of
these
presents, and command that you induct and appoint the foresaid Lord
Thomas,
or
his
procurator in
his name,
in and to
real, actual, and corporal
possession of said chaplaincy, and of
all the rights and pertinents thereof
; and
when inducted and appointed canonically, you defend him by strictly restraining
contradictors and
rebels,
if
there
be
any,
by
ecclesiastical
censure by
our
ordinary authority, and in sign of your appointment and of delivery of possession
to him, append your seal on the second tail after ours, to remain
for ever with
said appointment.
Given under our round seal, at our Palace of Spiny, the 6th
day of the month
of March,
in the year of the Lord
1451, according
to the
course and computation of the Scottish Church and of our consecration the 15th.
In the Parliament held at Stirling on 25th October 1451,
it is ordained
:

Among the Crown receipts for 1457 we have £16 received
from

Custuniarii of the great custom
of the burgh of
Inverness—and 20s received from the
bailies of the burgh
of Inverness, of the King's rents of said burgh.
Among

In the year 1454 occurred the fight betwixt a section of the

The circum-
stances have been frequently narrated, but never
correctly,

INVERNESSIANA.
127
nor
is
it known
tliat
the
principal
actors
were
not only
reconciled but became brothers*in-law.
The following ac-
count,
written
about
200
years
after
by
Mackintosh
of
Kinrara, bears every mark of being an unbiassed account,
and he treats of the event as one to be deplored
:
In 1454, a sudden and unexpected contest sprung up between Malcolm Mack-
intosh, commonly called Gilliecallum Oig, Mac-Mic-Gilliecallum Beg, grandson
of the afore-mentioned Malcolm Mackintosh (of Mackintosh), and John Munro,
tutor of Fowlis.
A very keen contention followed.
The origin of it was this
:
—John Munro was second son of Hugh Munro of Fowlis, and acted as tutor to
John Munro, his nephew, bj' his brother George Munro of Fowlis.
Returning
from a tour to the south for despatching his pupil's business, a dissension took
place between him and the inhabitants of Strathardle.
He was contemptuously
treated
and loaded
with great abu.se.
Intent upon revenge, he comes home,
informing his friends and relations
of the injury he has sustained, and implores
their assistance.
At the head of two hundred chosen men he advances with
all possible
speed,
and
before
his approach
is
observed
enters
Strathardle,
ravages the country, and carries off the herds of cattle.
At the river Findhorn
on
his
return,
the
afore-mentioned Malcolm
Oig,
meets
him
by accident,
and understanding the matter, is urged by the young men that follow him to
demand
a part
of the plunder.
John offers him twenty-four cows and a bull,
which Malcolm Oig
proudly
and
rashly
rejects,
insisting
on no less
than
one-third part.
John treats
his demand with scorn, and proceeds on his way
determined to give none.
Malcolm Oig incensed, instantly communicates this
to
his
friends,
and
immediately commands
the
inhabitants
of
Petty
and
Lochardill
to follow John and obstruct his progress until he, with the men
of
Strathnairn, shall have come
up.
His commands
are
obeyed.
They pursue
John beyond the water of Ness, and overtake him at a lake called Clachnaharry.
He (John) sends
off forty men with the booty, and encourages the rest to fight.
A fierce conflict ensues.
A few fall on each
side.
John, almost
slain,
is
left
among the dead, but Lord Lovat upon better information
takes care
of
his
recovery.
John was afterwards called " Baichlich," i.e. maimed, because he lost
his hand in that engagement.
From him descended the family of
Milltown.
Malcolm Oig was not present in that battle which arose from his temerity, for
the conflict took place before he came up.
The same Malcolm Oig afterwards married Janet Munro, sister of John.
A commemorative monument was
erected several years
ago by the late Hugh Kobert Dufi of Muirtown, on a
site
amid the rocks where the fight took place.
On the 4th August 1455, the King granted the following
letter
to the burgh
of Inverness, which
still
exists and is
endorsed in the handwriting of the period, partly in Latin
and partly in the Scottish language.
'^ Letters in favour of
the burgh of Inverness that Chanonri, called Forte la Rose
and Rosmarkin, that
their
gift
shall not
be prejudicial to
the gift of the burgh of Inverness of their liberty granted of
old before."
James, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to all good men of his whole realm,
cleric and
laic
; Greeting
: Though we
have otherwise
annexed,
united, and
incorporated the town of Fortrose, now called the Canonry, in which is situated
the Church
of Ross, with the burgh of Lower Rosemarky, together with the
liberties, commodities, and essements thereof, and with the other privileges and
customs—according as the foresaid burgh of Lower Rosemarky is more freely
infefted—it was not, nor is it our intention by this
that prejudice should arise
in any way to us, our bui'gesses, or our burgh of Inverness in our great customs,
or
to
the
former liberties or privileges granted to our said burgesses or to ovxr
burgh of Inerness aforesaid at a time of which there is no recollection thereof by
our predecessors, kings of Scotland; but rather to preserve and confirm, and by

128
INVERNESSIANA.
these presents we do confirm, unhurt and unweakened, the
rights,
liberties,
and privileges of our
said burgh and burgesses
thereof, in and by all as they
were infeft
:
and we
do not
wish by
this
union
or
annexation
granted
to
the Bishop or Church of Eoss to derogate in any way from said privileges and
liberties of our foresaid burgh.
In testimony of which matter to our present
charter we have commanded our great seal to be appended.

; John and George, Bishops
of the Churches of St Andrews, Moray, and Brechin

JAMES
II.
1437-1460. PART EIGHTH.
The
battle
of Brechin
fought
in
1452 by the
Earl
of
Huntly, on the part of the King, opposed
to the tiger Earl
of Crauford, and the other nobles in rebellion, consolidated
the power of the family of Huntly in the north, whence no
subsequent attempts
at dislodgment were
successful.
By
the beginning
of
the
16th
century, they
were, hereditary
keepers of the Castle of Inverness, and
all powerful
in the
neighbourhood,
supplanting
the
old
Earls
of
Ross
and
Moray.
Amongst those who rendered service to the Earl of Huntly
at the battle of Brechin was Alexander, son of Sir William
Baillie of Lamington, by his wife Marion Seton.
The
Baillies
claim,
and
probably
with
justice,
to
be
descended from
Alexander de
Baliol,
brother of John de
Baliol, who founded Baliol College, Oxford, which Alexander
was grand-uncle of King John Baliol.
The
tradition undoubtedly
is that
the above Alexander
Baillie was the first of the name who settled in the north at
Dunean.
The ancient titles of Dunean do not
exist, and it
is thus
difficult to determine what the original right granted was.
The
oldest document
extant
is an infeftment dated
17th
September 1554, in favour of David Baillie, the fourth pro-
prietor in the half of the lands of Sheuglie.
In the MS. history of the Baillies of Dunean,
it is stated
that
Alexander
married
Catherine,
only daughter of
Sir
Duncan
Grant
of
Freuchie,
by whom
he had two
sons,
Alexander, who
predeceased, and William, who
succeeded
his father, and was constable of the Castle of Inverness, an

INVERNESSIANA.
129
office long retained
in the family.
To whom William was
married is unknown, but his successor's name was Alexander,
who is found acting as Sheriff-Depute of Inverness in 1534,
as constable in 1546, and as a juryman the same year.
His
wife's name is
also unknown, but
it
is
stated that he had
two
sons, David and Thomas.
David, the
eldest
son, and
above referred to as infeft in the lands of Sheuglie, is found
on record holding a Court as Sheriff-Depute on 24th April
1553.
He
is
generally
styled
Constable
of the
Castle of
Inverness, and married Margaret, daughter of Hugh Rose
of Kilravock by his wife Margaret Urquhart of Cromarty.
It
is stated
that he was
infeft
in Dunain,
Torbreck, Bal-
robert, &c., on 17th February 1554, but we have not seen
the deed, and that he died in April 1558.
He is referred to
by the Earl of Huntly, in the following letter printed among
the Kilravock papers
;
Traist cousin,
after
hearty commendation
;
you
shall know I have got a
relaxation of the horning to tlie
M'l'arsoneis,
and another to your brother and
his accomplices, which you
shall receive, and keep the same
until
I advertise
you of
nevv.
You
need
not
to
ijroclaim
them,
because
they
are
already
relaxed by my letters afore, which
is sufficient thereanent
; therefore,
let the
men know that you have them lying beside you, but use them not, and j)roclaim.
them
not, until
I
advertise
you
of new,
and
let no more of your brother's
accomplices know of the same, but
so many as
I
caused relax
afore, until
I
advertise you of new.
You
shall receive this copy of the book of respond for
the Sheriff comi^ts,
and
cause David
Baillie and
Culloden provide
for their
letters
of bond
to be
for my
defence.
And God have you in keeping.
At
Finletter the xxv. of December.—Yours,
(Signed)
Huntly.
Endorsed " To our traist cousing Huchon Ros of Kilravok."
David had two sons, Alexander and William.
The eldest
Alexander, got a charter under the hands of the Regent of
his lands
of Dunain
in 1564.
In 1567 he
is
noticed
as
witness
to
a
charter.
In
1566-8, he
is found
acting
as
Sheriff-Depute.
On 15th August 1571 , he received a charter
from George Earl of Huntly of the lands of Balrobert, and
dying unmarried
in
1576, was
succeeded by
his
brother
William, who was called " William Mor Duneancroy."
He
married
Catherine,
third
daughter
of
Robert
Munro
of
Fowlis, by his wife Margaret Ogilvie of Findlater.
In 1583
William was
Provost of Inverness, and
in 1591
he is met
with as one of the witnesses to a charter.
He died prior to
1600—leaving
three
sons—Alexander,
James,
and
John.
Alexander, the eldest son, married Catherine Munro of the
family of Milltown, descended of the tutor of Fowlis, who
was wounded at Clachnaharry, and acted
as Bailie for the
family of Huntly.
He left at least two sons —William,
his
successor, 8th of Dunain, and David Baillie, first of Dochfour.
His daughter, Catherine, married one of the younger sons of
Fraser of Kilbokie.

i
We shall refer on a future occasion to the further descent
of the Baillies of Dunain, as also to the Baillies of Dochfour,
whose descendant, the present Evan Baillie of Dochfour, is
one of the principal landowners in the Highlands. "
In the year 1455, according
to Lesley—" He
(the King)
made such arrangements with the principal Captains of the
Isles and Highlands, that the same were as peaceable as any
part of the Lowlands, and obedient as well in paying of all
duties of their lands to the King, as ready to serve in war
with great companies
;
and
specially Donald, Lord of the
Isles and Earl of Ross, who oft before had made bands with
the Earls of Douglas and Crawfurd against the King, and
intromitted with the King's house of Inverness, and called
himself King of the
Isles
;
yet he came
to the King and
obtained
remission, and gave pledges
for good
rule, and
brought a company of 3000 men to the King at the siege of
Roxburgh."
Donald above referred to was not Earl of Ross,
but Donald Balloch.
In a Parliament held
at Edinburgh on 4th August and
following
days
in
1455,
it
is
ordained by
reason
of the
poverty of the Crown, which is often the cause of the poverty
of the realm, by advice and full council of Parliament thaTlT
certain lordships and
castles be annexed
to the Crown in
j
each part of the realm
for the residence of the King, and ~^
that such lordships shall not be given away in fee or frank
tenement to any of whatever estate or degree
: Among others
so disposed of we have—" Item, ye houss of Inuerness and
Urcharde, and ye lordschipe of Thaine, and ye lordschipe of
Albernethy,
with

of Inuerness,

The following grant, dated 10th July 1455, by Hugh son
of Michael, vicar of Daviot, to the altar of St Michael, the
Archangel, within the parish church of Inverness, is inter-
esting
:
v_>
* This is the great possession
of nearly 40,000 acres of land in the Braes of Strath-
dearn, received from the fanjily of Huntly in 1557, by that of Mackintosh, in part of the
assythment for the murder of William Mackintosh of Mackintosh in 1550.

1437-1460.
PART NINTH.
From the Chamberlain's accounts for the year 1456, we
find that he charges himself with rents of the lands round
Inverness, lying '^within the Barony of Leffaris* and Regality
of Ballockhill which are of the property of Moray."
" Item he charges himself with £144 of the rents of the
lands of Ard, Strathglass, Abertarf, and Strathardok, which
are in the hands of the Lord King, through the death of the
late Thomas Eraser of Lovat, in ward
of the
earldom
of
Moray from the said term with the tenandries thereof."
The
sum of this charge is evident.
" Item he charges himself with £50 of rents of the lands
of Urquhart and Grienmoriston for said term, which are the
property of the Lord King, and are granted to the Lord Earl
of Ross for
his
life, together with the
Castle
thereof, and
with £10 of rents of the lands of Bonoch and Bannachar for
the said term, which are the property of the Lord King, and
were worth of old 100 merks, except the fishings."
At Inverness on the 8th August 1456, Hugh Angus, son
and heir of the late Angus Peter, burgess of Inverness, sells
to his beloved William Bayth 8s 9d of annual
rent, from
six particates of land lying within said burgh, in the street
of Dymigisdaile on the west side thereof, whereof five parti-
cates lie contiguous between the common vennel at the south
on the one part, and the land of John William at the north
on the other;
Whereof the front
extends
to
the
King's
common highway towards the east, and the back to the land
of Ranald Clerk towards the west, to wit of two particates
of land between the said common vennel, which were Alex-
ander
Gollan's, 3s of annual rent
; Item 7d of annual rent
of the particate of land which was the late John Duncan's
:
Item 2s 4d of annual rent of the particate of land of Donald
Johnston
: Item 2s 4d of annual rent of the particate of
land of Ranald Clerk
: Item 6d of the annual rent of the
particate of land which was that of the late Andrew Reide,
in the same street (via) in the west part to the cross of the
burgh (market) on which a stone house was built, and between
the land of John Reide at the south on the other
side and
the King's common highway at
the north on the
other,
whose front extends to the King's common highway towards
'^ Castle Leather, at this time apparently a Barony.

to tlie land of Ranald Clerk towards
the west
: And all, &c.
'^ In testimony of which thing my
seal is appended
to the present
charter, and
for the greater
security of this matter the seal of the honourable man Hugh
Clerk, bailie, who for me gave heritable state and sasine, as
the manner
is,
of the
said annual
rents
to
the
foresaid
William, &c.
At said burgh the 8th day of the month of
August 1456.
Witnesses—the discreet men Alexander Vans,
John
Ceras,
Robert
Ceras,
Donald
Skynnar,
with many
others."
Andrew Black, chaplain, on the 20th of October 1456, as
son of the late John Blaik, burgess of Inverness, sells to his
beloved Alexander Yaus, burgess of said burgh, 6s of annual
rent of two particates of land lying within said burgh, one
of which
lies
in Church
Street
on
the
east
side
thereof,
between the land of the late James Johnson at the south on
the one
part, and the land of John Thome Junior at the
north on
the
other;
whose
front
extends
to
the King's
common highway towards the west, and the back to the Old
Fosse towards the east— to wit, of that particate of land 3s
of annual rent.
Item—3s of annual rent of one particate of
land lying in
the same highway on
the west
side of said
street, between the land of Thomas Cuthbert at the south
on the one
side, and the land
of Matilda Beichan
at the
north on the other part ; whose front extends
to the King's
common highway towards
the
east, and
the back
to
the
Water of Ness towards the west, for a certain sum, &c.
" In
testimony of which thing, as
I had no
seal of my own, I
have, with instance, procured and caused
to be appended to
my present charter the
seal of the
discreet man, William
Michael, one of the bailies of said burgh, at said burgh, the
20th October
in the year
1456.
Witnesses—John Junior,
John Thome, bailie (who for me gave with effect hereditary
state and sasine, as the manner is, of said 6s of annual rent
to the foresaid
Alexander), William de Botha, Donald of
the Old Castle, John Coupillande, and John Gray Bkynar,
with many others."
In a Parliament held
at Edinburgh on 6th March 1457,
it seems speedful
to the King and the three
estates, as
to
the
Article
of
Session,
that
it be
continued
until
next
Parliament,
in manner
following—" That
is
to
say,
the
Lords of Session shall sit thrice in the year, each time forty
days, in these three places, Edinburgh, Perth, and Aberdeen;
the number of persons shall be nine, three from each estate,
and the clerk of the register.
The next session
to be held
in Aberdeen on 15th June, &c.," and among those appointed

i
134
INVERNESSIANA.
to this session we have Walter Thorn sone, of Inverness, as
one of the three appointed for the burghs.
From the Chamberlain Accounts for 1457, we find there
is
disbursed
to
" Alexander Flemyng,
burgess
of Perth,
Keeper of the Castle of Inverness for the fabric and repair
of the houses in said
Castle, and the enclosure round the
walls thereof by command of the Lord King."
No sum is
mentioned.
1457.
The
Chamberlain
charges
himself with, among
others, £50 for
'' the whole rents of the Lordship of Urqu-
hart and Glenmoriston
for said term, and with £10 for the
whole rents of the Barony of Bona and Bannachar
for said
term."
From the discharge we have " to Lord John Oggilby of
Luntrethyn on the part of his spouse
for the terce due to
her of the rents
of the lands
of the property
of Moray,
near Inverness, belonging to the Court of Ballokhill, for the
i
said term, &c., £16 12s 9d
; and allocated to those accounting
f
for the
rents
of the lands
of Urquhart and Glenmoriston
granted by the Lord King
to the Earl of Ross along with
the Castle thereof for the term of his life for said term, £50
;
and to the Mair, near Inverness for said term, 13s 4d."
To Celestine of the Isles at the time when the Lord King
was last at Inverness, for his fee for said term, £13 6s 8d.
For the expenses of the Lords
the Bishop of Moray and
Lord Glammis for feuing of lands near Elgin and Inver-
ness, 44s.
Deductions allowed the Chamberlains—"and allowed them
of the rents of the water of the burgh of Inverness for which
the bailies of said burgh have rendered an account, which
rents extend
for the year
to 80 merks, £17 15s 7d of said
term, but the rest of said term of the rents of said water of
Ness, viz., £8 17s 9d, are allowed above, and negligently, in
terce due to the wife of Lord John de Oggilby of the rents,
of the property of the lands of Ballochill in the Earldom of
Moray, because the rents of said water of Ness are the pro-
perty of the Crown of which it is known, that nothing pertains
to the Earls of Moray."
Upon the 8th February 1457, the before-mentioned Hugh
Angusson, burgess
of Inverness,
sells
to
his beloved and
special
cousin,
Alexander Wans,
burgess of
said
burgh,
those
annual
rents
of
the
lands under written
with
the
intention and
to the end
of the assignation
thereof being
made to the altar of St Michael within the Parish Church of
Inverness, for the augmentation of divine worship there and
to a chaplain to perform divine service for ever.

Street,

part, and the land of the said
late Richard Johnson at the north on the other, and all, &c.
" In witness of which thing I have caused my seal
to be
appended to my present charter, and for the greater evidence
and security of the matter, I have procured with instance to
be appended to this present charter, the seal of the prudent
man Hugh Clerk, one of the bailies of said burgh, who gave
sasine of said annual rents to the foresaid Alexander, before
these witnesses Andrew Grame, Donald of the Old
Castle,
John Gray, Andrew Gardin, and William Grame, at said
burgh, 8th February 1457."
King James was at Inverness
in the month
of October
1457, as appears by the following charter to the burgh of
Tain and St Duthus
:
James, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to all good men of his whole realm?
cleric and laic; Greeting
: Know that we, for the praise and honour of God Omni-
potent, and
of St Duthac,
have
approved,
ratified,
and by this our present
charter have confirmed the infeftments,
donations, and concessions made and
gi-anted in times past by our i)redecessors, kings of Scots, to the said St Duthac,
and to his collegiate church
of Tain, and to the chaplains and
clerics thereof,
and to the town of Tain, and those inhabiting the town itself, with the immunity
granted them within the four angular
crosses
placed
around
the
limits
of
the bounds of Tain, and all liberties and privileges whatsoever, hitherto granted
them by our said predecessors, as freely, quietly, fully, wholly, honourably, well,
and in
peace, as
the chaplains,
clerics, and inhabitants possessed and enjoyed
said immunity, liberties, and privileges heretofore, together with the first foun-
dations
of said immunity, and liberties, and
privileges foresaid,
so, however,
that our present confirmation does not turn out in future to the prejudice of
our burgesses of Inverness, with the infeftments and others made and granted
to the said burgh
of Inverness by our
predecessors
:
In testimony
of which
matter, to our present charter of confirmation we command our great seal to be
appended
:
"Witnesses—The reverend father in Christ, George, Bishop of Brechin,
ou^r chancellor

our beloved cousins, Alexander, Lord Montgomery, Patricius,
Lord Glamis, Robert, Lord Boyd, James de Levingstoun, our great chamberlain,

with the original, nothing being added or removed which might change the sub-

Altlioiigli
the privileges of the burgh of Inverness were
expressly reserved by the foregoing charter, the town would
appear
to have taken alarm, and
in consequnce, at Edin-
burgh on the 22 d October, ten days after, the King granted
the following letter
:
James by the grace of God King of Scots, to all good men of his whole realm,
cleric and laic
; Greeting
: Know that we have approved, ratified, and confirmed
the infeftments and concessions made by our predecessors, Kings of Scots, to
the collegiate church of St Duthac and the
chaplains and
clerics thereof, and
to others inhabiting the town of Tain, with the immunity granted them within
the four angular crosses around the limits and bounds of the said town, and the
liberties and privileges also granted them by our said ancestors
;
It never was,
nor is it, our intention by this to create any prejudice to ourselves or our burgh
of Inverness, or our burgesses,
thereof in our great or small customs, liberties,
or privileges, granted to our
said burgesses or our bvirgh
of Inverness by our
predecessors Kings
of Scots beyond the recollection of memory
; nay, rather
but to preserve unencumbered and unimpaired the rights,
liberties, privileges,
and infeftments
of
said
burgh
of
Inverness,
and
of our
burgesses
thereof,
according as they were infefted
free and unhurt
in and by all means, and we
have and do confirm them by these presents
:
"Wherefore we
straitly command
and charge all and sundry our lieges and subjects, that no one in contravention
of the liberty of said burgh of Inverness, and of the burgesses thereof,
sell, exer-
cise, merchandize, or infringe their privileges, or presume to attempt any thing
in contravention of their infeftments in future times, under all the pain which
they shall incur towards our royal laws.
Given under our great
seal at Edin-
burgh the 22d day of the month of October, in the year of the Lord 1457, and
of our reign the 21st.

as
well,

of these presents, of the constituted order of
acolytes, with respect
to whom
by our foresaid authority,
by the tenor of these presents we dispense in the

his time only to the presentation of
the
said William Buthe, and to our
collation, we
confer upon him,
and by
the
same also provide for him, and by delivery of our ring, we have inducted and in-
vested him partially with the same by committing
to him
specially the cure

:
Which John,

PART SECOND.
Most of the deeds extant refer to lands and acres within
what
is known as the
territory of the burgh of Inverness,
and to those who care about tracing localities
illustrated by
the
charters now being published,
it
will be useful to give
here a document containing a pretty full enumeration of the
contents of the parish of Inverness and Bona, framed in the
year 1634,
It is in the main correct, and its omissions and
errors are brought out by the objections stated for the land-
ward heritors, who appear with justice to have complained of
the
stenters
dealing so leniently with the town's
territory.
The paper is in the handwriting of Lachlan Mackintosh of
Kinrara, second son of Sir Lachlan Mackintosh of that Ilk,
and
is
entitled " Coppie of the
Stent
Roll of the par
:
of
Inverness, with the reasons of reduction thereof."
Lachlan Mackintosh was a man of varied accomplishments,
a
scholar,
lawyer,
genealogist, and
withal a good
soldier.
He
it was who
wrote, in elegant Latin, the history of the
family,
which
appears
by
the
title
page
to
have
been
finished in 1677
:
At Inverness the last day of March 1634 years,
for obedience to the charge
given
to the
haill parishioners
of
Inverness,
and to the heritors,
liferenters,
owners, and possessors of the lands within the said parish
of
Inverness and
parish of Bona, now united and annexed
thereto,
conform
to
the
letters
of
horning raised
at the
instance
of
the
minister,
elders,
and

of
the
Session of Inverness, dated at Edinburgh the 13th day of February last, bypast,
charging them to convene and choose stenters, who, by advice of masons, wrights,
slaters, glass-wrights, and other craftsmen requisite, shall modify and set down
what sum

sufficiently repair the said kirk of Inverness in the side walls,

said burgh should
be*stented to, for payment of the said sum

Sum of the acres above written is 335g acres.
Reasons proving that
the forewritten stent (being most unequally propoHioned,
and in law reducibleJ, cannot be a rule for future stents vnthin the Parish of
Inverness.
The reasons of reduction
:
First, the pretended stent
roll is reducible because the heritors and others of
the landward of the Parish of Inverness (outwith the territory
of the town)
supposed and ordained to pay the
just half of the foresaid stent
were never
summoned, nor present at the
stenting,
for of 15 heritors and others
of that
part of the landward who were stented, there were none present but two, viz,
:
—Alexander
Baillie and James
Fraser, and
all
the
rest were
burgesses
of
Inverness
; and further,
they who were nominated to be
stenters, were all of
the town and territory of Inverness, excej^t the forenamed James Fraser, who
disclaims that ever he was one of the stenters
of that stent.
This reason is
verified by the pretended stent roll itself.
Secondly, the pretended stent roll is reducible because the pretended stenters
were never warranted nor authorised by the kirk-session of Inverness to stent
the parish,
else there had been an Act of the kirk-session for that
effect, but
there is no such Act to be produced, and therefore.
Thirdly,
the pretended
stent
roll
is reducible
because by
it the
stent
is
equally proportioned on every plough of the parish, and it cannot be denied but
several ploughs in that
parish
are twice better than others, and in
all equity
every plough should be stented according to the just value
thereof, as well as
every burgh is taxed according to its value.
Fourthly, the stent roll is reducible because
several lands and rents of the
parish are totally left out and not stented at
all, viz.,
first there are 4 ploughs
of the common tacks and acres of the town lands omitted, for the immunity, com-
mon tacks and acres of the town are estimated by the
stent
roll itself to 24
ploughs, and every plough is stented in 25 merks, and so should bear 600 merks,
and yet are not stented but in 500 merks, and so 100 merks of the stent, being
the proportion
of 4 ploughs,
are omitted, and but
20 ploughs only stented
;
secondly,
of the foresaid 20 ploughs of the town lands that bear stent, the acres
alone by the pretented stenters' own confession ia the stent roll make 14 ploughs,
for each
acre
is
stented in a merk, and the pretended stent
roll bears the
number of 335J acres, estimated to 14 ploughs, allowing 25 merks to each plough,
and
it cannot be denied but the common tacks of Inverness, by and over the
acres are 18 ploughs, which, with the number of 14 aforesaid, makes 32 ploughs,
so that 20 ploughs only being stented there are 12 ploughs
of the town lands
omitted and not stented at
all
; thirdly, the plough of
little Hilton
is totally
omitted
; fourthly, the two ploughs of Castlehill are altogether omitted
; fifthly,
the whole burgh roods, mill rents,
mill crofts, and rent of the water of Ness,
which
are estimated to be worth 24 chalders of victual
or 24 j)loughs
of old
extent, are omitted, so that in effect there are 39 or 40 ploughs
of the town's
lands omitted and not stented at all j and this fourth reason also is clear by the
stent roll.
Fifthly, the stent roll is reducible because some lands of the landward are
stented above their just proportion, suppose the proportions by ploughs were
right, as it
is not—for
first, the lands
of Culloden are stented in 12 ploughs,
there
being but
xi.
within
the parish of Inverness,
for the twelfth
j)lough
thereof, viz., Culchunnick, lies within the parish of Daviot
; second, the lands
of Culcabock, Meikle Hilton, and Knockintinnel are stented for 8 ploughs, being
in effect but 6 of old extent.
Sixthly, the stent
is reducible because the stenters were so gross as to even
the burgh of Inverness, but with the third part of any stent imposed on that
parish.
Note.—The 2d, 4th, 5th, and 6th reasons above written might reduce a stent
of 200,000 pounds.

INVERNESSIANA.
147
It is to be remembered that the most part of this pretended
stent, being so
inequally proportioned, was never paid as yet, nor the kirk and steeple restored,
3 was projected at the time of imposius that stent.
The first reason of the reduction
is that of
the 15 heritors of the landward,
there were but 2 present, and all the rest of the stenters were burgesses of the
)wn.
2. Of the 4 stenters there was but one only of the landward who disclaimed
Ihis being on it.
3. The proportioning the ploughs is unequal, some ploughs being twice better
[than others.
4. Some lands, to the quantity of 40 or 50
chalders, of the town lands and
[other rents,
are omitted
altogether, and others,
viz., those of
the landward
Iwronged and estimated above their avail.
5. The town and landward of the parish have not been equally valued in said
stent.
6. This pretended stent-roll differs from that which is the ground of the charge
whereby Drakies was charged.
7. There is no Act of the Kirk-Session authorising the stenters.
8. Two of the stenters disclaim under their hand their being on that stent.
9.
Drakies, in the writ of his suspension, confesses that stent was imiiosed in
time of the wadset, and should not be charged on Mackintosh.
10. There is no lawful probation in the decreet.
11. The decreet is null as to the annual rent.
12.
It is null because it makes Mr James Baird compear for Mackintosh, he
not being in the suspension as a party.
13.
It is null because the
first sheet
is added after the subscribing and the
margin not subscribed.
14. It makes no mention of the writer, and therefore Jas.
6, 13p. , cap. 175 (is
incompetent).

The king's miln at the Haugh having been found destruc-

dated 16th May 1474 :—
James, by the grace ot God, King of Scots, to
all and sundry our lieges and
subjects whom
it
effeirs,
to whose knowledge these our
letters
shall come
;
Greeting
:
For as much as we
are truly informed by our commissioners that
passed into the north parts of our realm for the setting of our lands and revenues,
that our miln,
built upon the water of Ness, on the west side of our Castle of
Inverness, has done, and daily does, great scaith and damage to our true lieges
inhabiting the said burgh, through the destruction of young
fry of
fish,
to the
great
hurt of them and scaith to us, in the custom
of our said burgh:
We,
therefore, considering the scaiths beforewritten, fou.nded of verity, with advice of
our said commissioners, have given, and granted, and by these, our letters, give
and grant to the Alderman,
Bailies,
Council,
and community of our burgh
of Inverness, our said miln to be destroyed and cast down for evermore, for the
eschewing of the
scaiths beforesaid,
the
said Alderman, Bailies,
Council and
community, paying yearly to us for the said miln the sum of six merks of annual
of the usual money of our realm at the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas,
by even portions for evermore,
only, for
all other manner of duties that, we
may ask
or require
for the
said miln
; and besides we have granted, and by
these our letters grant to the said community and burgh, the thirled multure of
the lands pertaining to us, which were thirled to our said miln of
before,
to
come to the milns of Inverness, aye and until it be thought expedient to us or
our
successors
to
build
a
miln
in
another
competent
i)lace
that
might
do no scaith to our said lieges in their fishings for the said annual
:
Wherefore,
we charge straitly, and command all and sundry our lieges and subjects foresaid,
that none of you take upon hand to vex, inquiet, or disturb the saids Alderman,
Bailies, and Council, with the community of our said burgh, in the destruction
and downcasting of the said miln and brooking of the said thirled multure dur-
ing the time foresaid, under
all the highest pain and chai-ge, you and each one
of you, commit and incur against our majesty in that part

The
exactions
of the
clergy on the
occasion
of births,
marriages,
and
deaths
were
so
offensive,
and
the
dis-
solute lives of many of their number made the ecclesiastical
system so odious, that in course of time it fell almost with-
out a struggle.
It is well that those of the present day should know what
their
predecessors and the then
inhabitants
of Inverness
suffered
ecclesiastically, while the
charity, kindliness, and
peaceful example set, must not be overlooked.
These observations occur with relation to the composition
into a money payment, made by David, Bishop of Moray,
and Master Alexander Sutherland, perpetual Vicar of Inver-
ness on the. one part, and the Alderman, Bailies, and com-
munity of the burgh of Inverness on
the other
part, dated
20th July 1474.
It may be mentioned that the " corpse present" was a tax
exacted by the vicar on the death of a parishioner, usually
the deceased's best cow.
The " upmast claith" also claim-
able by the vicar was the deceased's uppermost bed covering.
These scandalous exactions were sharply denounced by Sir
David Lindsay in his satire of the three estates
:
The vicar tuik the best cow be the held
Incontinent when my father was deid.

Their upmaist claes, that was of raploch grey,
The vicar gart his clerk bear them away.
Follows the memorandum of agreement
:
Memorandum that
it is appointed, concorded, and decreed by us, David, by
the grace of God, Bishop of Moray, and oiir chapter,
chapterly gathered there-
for in the
consistorial place
of our
said
kirk, the 20th day of the month of
July, the year of God 1474, in these causes and matters after-following, proponed
and furthshown before us, the foresaids David, Bishop, and canons of our chapter,
by
those
parties
after written—that is to say. Master Alexander Sutherland,
vicar perpetual of the said burgh of Inverness, and the alderman, bailies, and
community
of the
said burgh, in the first, anent the debate betwixt the said
parties
of
the
taking
of the corpse-present and
the uppermost
cloth
to be
taken within the same burgh, and the freedom of the same, off free burgesses, or
off their servants,
it is provided, and finally decreed for ever to eudure, that the
said vicar nor his successors shall never have nor raise corpse-present nor upper-
most cloth off no free burgess nor his servants within the
said burgh of Inver-
ness, or the freedom of the same
: And
also, the said vicar shall have
off the
seculars (the
laity), of every child in the freedom of the same, but fourpence,
and twopence to be given to the clerk
: And also, that none shall pay a pound of
wax to the
vicar, but that they pay
(of their own
will), and are of power to
pay by law a corpse-present and uppermost cloth to the said vicar
: And as anent
the teind salmon, they shall be sorted even as they are
taken, the great
toge-
ther, the middlemost together, and
the
smallest together, and
tlie
said vicar
shall take to the teind the second best of every sort

if any burgess
shall happen to dwell without the town immunity, and
within the freedom of

and upperQiost cloth and all other demand of the
foresaid vicar as
they that
remain within the said town and burgh

LIV.
JAMES III,
1460-1488,
PART FOURTH,
It would have been seen in Chapter L. that the Baron of
Kih'avock could not build a place of defence without a license
from the Earl of Ross.
Alexander Earl of Ross and Lord
of the Isles having risen
in
rebellion, whereby he incurred
forfeiture, and the doom of sentence being imminent, it was
a prudent step on the part of the Thane of Cawdor to tender
his submission, as Sheriff of Nairn, and offer his
service
to
the Crown.
This was done at Inverness upon the
13th of January
1475, in presence of George Earl of Huntly, Lieutenant of
the north
; whereupon John Kinloch, Priest of Brechin, at
the
instance
ot
the Thane,
issues
the
following
notarial
instrument
:
In the name of God, Amen
: By this public instrument be
it evidently patent
to
all,
that in the year from the incarnation
of the Lord 1475, on
the
13th
day of the month of January, the 9th indiction, and the 5th year of the ponti-
ficate
of the most Holy Father
in Christ, and
our
Lord
Sextus, by Divine
Providence Pope the 4th, in
presence of me notary public and of the witnesses
under written, before the great and potent Lord George Earl of Huntly, Lord of
Gordon and Badenoch, and lieutenant, there personally compeared the nobleman
"William de Caldor, thane thereof, submitting himself to our supreme lord the
King, and to the
said Lord-Lieutenant in his name before
the
term
limited
and
assigned
to him and others, after public proclamation made at the market
cross of the burgh of Inverness, according to the form and tenor of the instruction
of our supreme lord the King, and offered, that he was ready and prepared,
always strictly to obey and serve in all commands and services of the King for
all
his lands and
office of Sheriffdom of Nairn, with the pertinents,
belonging
to him by hereditary right, held formerly of John
late Earl of Ross
; and to
do for our supreme lord the King those things which he is by law bound, offering
himself and his homage to the said Lord-Lieutenant
in name
of our supreme
lord the King, and sought
of new
to be
infeft in
his
said lands and foresaid
office with the
pertinents by name as
above, and sought that the remission of
his
past crimes might be granted him.
The said Lord Lieu.tenant with joy
received the foresaid "William in the King's name.
"Upon which all and sundry
the foresaid Thane William sought of me notary public within written, public
instrument or instruments to be made for him;
These things were done at the
burgh of Inverness about 10 o'clock forenoon or thereabouts, the year, month,
day, indiction, and pontificate as above
: Present—the noblemen Alexander Gor-
doune
of Megmar, Thomas Cummyn of Alter, Hugh Rose of Kylrawak, Alex-
ander Morvate of Balquholy, Duncan Forbes of Foulis, Alexander Strathauchin
of Leddyntusch, and David Ogiluy of Tolwad, with many others, all witnesses to
the premises called and also required.
A citation is issued under the great seal at Edinburgh, on
the 30th September 1475, against John Earl of Ross, and
Lord of the Isles, to be served at the Castle of Dingwall and

152
INVERNESSIANA.
at the cross and market place of Inverness, to answer for
his
treasons
and
correspondence
with
Edward
King
of
England.
The execution of date 16th October 1475 bears that the
messenger passed to the Castle of Dingwall and asked entry
to the presence of John Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles,
the which he could not
get.
Then he warned, summoned,
and
charged
the
said John
to compear
before
the
next
Parliament at Edinburgh on
1st December, to answer
for
his treasons and communings with the King of England,
and with Sir James of Douglas, some time Earl of Douglas,
&c.
And also the same day at the market
cross
of Inver-
ness, he summoned by open proclamation the
said John,
&c.,
before these witnesses, John
Lessar, Henry Fynlaw,
bailies of the said burgh, John of Dunbar, Archibald Brothy,
with divers others.
The messenger takes
instruments
on
his
citations and
executions of charge, the one at Dingwall and the other
at
Inverness.
The witnesses to the latter at Inverness are the
prudent men John Lessar, Henry Fynlaw,
bailies
; John
Dunbar, Archibald
Brothy, Hugh
Clerk, Engine Achlek,
Donald Anderson, Adam Brothy, and M^Gillemartyn, with
many others.
As John failed to appear, the doom of forfeiture is pro-
nounced against him in Parliament on 1st December 1475.
In the deed after noticed, reference
is made
to William
Cuthbert, bailie of Inverness, and Lord
of the Old
Castle.
In the genealogy ofMons. Colbert, the minister of Louis XIY.
,
there
is
no mention made
of a William
Cuthbert,
thus
establishing
the
fact
that
there
were
two
families—the
Cuthberts of Castlehill, and of Auld Castle.
Donald Johnson, burgess
of Inverness, with consent and
assent of his wife Janet, daughter of Donald Coysone, sells
to Marjory Michael three acres of his land lying in the terri-
tory of the Old Castle, viz., two acres between the land of
the Holy Cross of the Parish Church of Inverness, on both
sides, both on the south and north, whose front extends to
the King's common highway which leads to Easter Drakies
towards the west, and the back to the Brumebank towards the
east, and the third acre lying in the territory of said Old Castle,
which is called the Goat Acre, between the land of the Old
Castle at the north on the one side, and the land of St Mary
the Virgin of the great altar of the Parish Church of said burgh
at the south on the other, whose front extends to the King's
common highway which leads to Easter Drakies towards the
west, and the back to the Brumebank towards the east, &c.

writes
^^ From the ruins of the family of Clandonald, and some of
the neighbouring Highlanders, and also by their own virtue,
the surname of Clankenzie,

PART FIFTH.
The following deed by Alexander
Donaldson,
dated at
Inverness 6tli July 1481,
is curious, in respect of the nature
of part of the
subject conveyed.
Upon the subjects which
lay on the
east
side of Church
Street was
erected a barn
containing three couples and two forks,
'^ and on the west
part of said land, without the barn, a bigging or small room,
well and completely
enclosed."
In the
after parts of the
deed this latter is more than once referred to, and seems
to
have been considered as of some importance.
Perhaps the
temporary nature of the
structure, as it was merely a bigg-
ing, that is, a rudely and hurriedly constructed
erection, as
well as its manifest usefulness in connection with the barn
occasioned the frequent mention
;
To all who shall see or hear
of this
charter, Alexander Donaldson,
son and
heir of the
late Donald Symonson,
burgess of Inverness
; Greeting eternal in
the Lord
: Know that I, with consent and assent of Matilda my mother and of
my friends and relatives, have given, granted, and by this my present charter
confirmed, to the honourable man Lord Thomas Moravia, a piece
of my laud
lying in said burgh, in Church
Street, on the east side thereof, between the
land of Thomas Johnson at the south, and the land of Marjory Awes at the north,
in breadth, and in length from my own land
at
the
west,
towards
" le fouU
poull"
at the
east, upon which piece a barn
is built containing three couples
and two forks, and on the west part of said land, without the barn, a bigging or
chamber which
is well and completely
enclosed, without any impediment or
obstacle,
for a certain sum of money, which the foresaid Lord Thomas com-
pletely and faithfully paid into my hands, with which I hold me well content,
pacified, and paid
: To be held and had,
said piece of land with the edifices and
enclosure as said is, of me, my heirs,and assignees, by the foresaid Lord Thomas,
his
heirs
and assignees in
feu and
heritage
forever,
with
all
commodities,
liberties, and
easements, and
their
just

whatsoever,

or which may in future
in any way justly belong,

wholly,
honourably, well and in peace, and without any annual to any one,
but freely to himself and
liis
heirs
as said is
: And I, the said Alexander, my
heirs and assignees, shall warrant, acquit, and for ever defend said piece of land
with
tbe enclosure and
edifices
as said
is against all mortals
:
In testimony of
which matter, as
I had no seal of my own present, I have procured with great
instance, and caused
to be appended to this my present charter, the seal of the
discreet man Andrew Fcrchard, one of the bailies of said burgh, who for me gave
with effect sasine and
hereditary possession
of
said piece of
hind
with
the
enclosure to the said Lord Thomas
:
At said burgh the Gth day of the month of
July in the year of the Lord 1481.
Witnesses—Lord Thomas Johnson, Lord
WilUani
Fartick, Hugh Anguson, John Alexanderson, Thomas Grey, servitor,
with many others called and sijecially asked.
The following obligation by Farquhar Mackintosh, younger
of Mackintosh, to the baron of Kilravock, is interesting, and
has reference
chiefly to Ewen, son of Hector Maclean, who
resisted Kilravock's claim to the lands of Urquhart.
It
is
signed at Croy, but several of the
parties referred to were
inhabitants of Inverness, and it is therefore given
:
Be it known to all men by these present letters, that I, Farquhar Mackintosh,
son and apparent heir to l)uncan Mackintosh, Captain
of the
Clan
Cliattan,
to be bound and obliged, and by the tenor
of
these present
letters, and
the
faith of my body, loyally and truly, bind and oblige me, to a right honourable
man, Hugh the Kose, baion of Kilravock, and to his sons, his brother, kin and
party, in lawful help, supply, maintenance and defence,
in
all actions, causes
and quarrels they have ado (with), for all the days of my life
;
Excepting my
allegiance to my sovereign lord the King, and my father's worship, and to stand,
enjoy, and bide at the counsel of the said Hugh Kose, baron, and his son's, Hugh
the Kose, son and apparent heir to the foresaid baron, William the Kose and
Alexander the Kose, brothers german to the foresaid baron, in all actions, lawful
and honest matters I have, or shall have, to do in time to come
: And the fore-
said persons
shall
be
i>rinci])al of my counsel,
and
I
shall
not
d(.li\er
nor
outgive any matter that
I
shall have
to
do, without
the
advice, counsel, and
consent of the foresaid persons, and
s[)ecially the foresaid baron and Hugli
his
son
:
And if that Ewen Makachtane will come before Mackintosh my father and
me, and bind him
to underly Mackintosh and eight persons chosen by them
with him, in all matters debateable betwixt the foresaid baron and Ewen,
the
foresaid
Mackintosh and the
eight persons
being sworn to
give
each one
of
them, as far as they have right or law,
it appeases me
:
And if the said Ewen
will not, I the foresaid Farquhar, bind and oblige me, as it
is
befoi-e written,
to take lawful part with the said baron, his children and party, against the said
Ewen and his party
: And this to do and fulfil in all things and by all things, in
manner and form before written, the
great oath sworn, and the holy gospel
toached,
I, the foresaid Farquhar, bind and oblige me to the said Hugh the
Kose, baron, his sons, brothers, kin, and party, as
is before written, under the
pain of inability,
perjury, and infamy, in
the most
strict
style, and form
of
band or obligation, that made is or can
be
devised
: And
also all lands, tacks,
mails, and
profits which were
in the hands
of the foresaid
baron,
his sons,
bi'others, kin and
party, which
I have intromitted with before the making of
this band, I freely assign and
deliver to themselves
again in such
likewise as
they had before
:
And I shall not intromit with any tacks or profits which they
have or shall have in time to come, as our band proports
: And if
it liap})en the
foresaid baron, his children, and party,
to get tacks or roums
in any
places,
so
that my roums
be not menaced, I bind and oblige me with all my power to
help,
supply, maintain, and defend
to the utmost, under pains
foresaid,
all
fraud, guile, delay, exception (being) posti)oned and removed.
In witness hereof,
because
I, the
said Farquhar, have no
seal proper of my own, I have pi'ocured
with instance the seal of an honourable man, Henry Fynlasone,
bailie of Inver-
ness, to be affixed to
this present writ, before these witnesses Hugh the Rose,
son aiid apparent to the foresaid baron, William the Kose, John Barbour, burgess
of
Invei-ness
; Gillemycell JMalys, tailor
; Kob.
Tailyour, and Donald Makfaill,
with others, divers and sundry.
And also I, Duncan Mackintosh, consent and
give
leave
to my
foresaid son Farquhar,
to bind,
keep, and
fulfil
this band
with
all circumstances
before
written
; in likewise
allow
the
foresaid baron
to bind
with my foresaid son.
In witness
hereof, I have
affixed my proper
seal to this
present writ
at
Croy, before
these
witnesses, in time of the said
procuration, the 23d day of September the year 1481.

JAMES in.
1460-1488. PART SIXTH.
The following singular document appears in the last place
where it might be expected to be found—that is, among the
Kilravock muniments.
There had been considerable ill-feeling between the Mack-
intoshes and
Roses
in connection with
the
possession
of
Glen-Urquhart.
The Roses, with whom
the
district was
permitted to remain, were unable to retain possession long.
The history of the family states that Lachlan Mackintosh of
Gellovie,
commonly
called
Lachlan
Badenoch,
had
five
daughters.
Of these,
the names
of four are
given—viz.,
More, or Marion, married
first to the Laird of Macgregor,
and secondly,
to
Stewart, Baron of Kincardine;
Marjory,
married to Ewen MacAUan of Lochiel
;
Catherine, to Ranald
Macdonald of Moidart
; Jean, to Calder of Assenauly
; and
, to Farquhar, son of Hector Maclean, founder of the
good old house of Kingairloch.
Whether Lady Kingairloch
was the Margaret mentioned in the following deed is doubt-
ful.
Tytler,
referring
to
the unhappy
life
of Annabella
Drummond, after she became widow of James L, says—" It
was a melancholy consequence of the
insecurity of persons
and of property in those dark times
that a widow became
the mark or the victim of every daring adventurer, and by
repeated nuptials was compelled
to defend
herself against
the immediate attacks of licentiousness or ambition,"—and
we here see how a father proposed to treat his own daugh-
ter
:—
.
This indenture, made at Inverness the 15th day of May, the year of God 1482
years,
proporfcs and
bears
witness,
that
it
is
appointed and fully
accorded
betwixt honourable men, Lauchlan Mackintosh
of
Gellovie,
ou the one part,
and Donald, Angus Mackintosh's son, on the other part, in form, manner, and
effect, as after follows—that is to say, for so much as it is
rehearsed, presumed,
and in some part known by part of the eldest of the land, that Hugh the Rose,
baron of Kilravock, should have no title of right to the Castle
of Kilravock,
nor to
the ground that it stands on
;
therefore, the
said Donald is obliged to
the said Lauchlan, in all
possible
haste, that he shall take the
Castle of Kil-
ravock, and then
deliver the
castle to the said Lauchlan, so that he come to
rescue him in haste, and come to receive the
castle when it is taken
: And for
the which taking, the said Lauchlan Mackintosh shall make incontinent, without
any longer delay, the said Donald Angussone, constable and keeper under himself
of the said castle, as long as it may be brukyt (held) and enjoyed by any manner
of way,
either by the
law,
or in
spite of the law
; and he shall give the said
Donald for the keeping of the said castle, in his
fee, all the land that was called
Cannekell, that is to say, all the land that is betwixt the new mill that was
last
made under the
said castle and the town
of the Holme, on the water
side of
Nairn, and
all the land that
is betwixt the said
castle and the kirk
of
Croy,
together with the said
mill, free, so long
as the
said
castle may be kept and

enjoyed as said is, -and ten raerks worth of land free in his fee, for all the days
of the said Donald's lifetime, either in Petty or in
Strathnairn,
or where the
said Laiichlan may easiest and best get and
lose the
said ten merks worth
of
land free in his fee as said is
: And if
it happen that the said Lauchlan cause or
make the said Donald, by any manner
of means,
deliver the said castle, after
that
it be
taken,
to the said baron of Kilravock,
or to his folks or friends, he
shall make the said Donald sure forthwith,
>vithout any longer delay,
of ten
pounds worth of lands, free in his fee for
all the days
of
his
life, in such like
places as is above written, without fraud or
guile.
And, besides, for the more
kindness, truthfulness, and security, the said Donald
shall marry and espouse
Margaret, daughter to the said Lauchlan Mackintosh, the said Lauchlan bringing
the dispensation out of Kome at his expense
: And as soon as the said
castle is
taken by the said Donald, the said Lauchlan shall cause, incontinent, without
any longer delay, handfast Margaret
his
said daughter, with the
said Donald,
and lie with him as she were his lawful wife
: And as soon
as the dispensation
comes home, the said Donald is obliged, incontinent, without any longer delay,
to marry and espouse the said Margaret, and to hold her in honour and worship
at
all his power as his wedded wife,
for
all
the
days
of
his
life
: And
the
said Lauchlan shall make thankful payment of forty merks of the usual money of
Scotland
in marriage goods
to
the
said
Donald,
in
penny and pennyworth
thereof, ten merks
to be paid in hand the first day that his said daughter
is
handfast, or lies with the said Donald, and ten merks at the next term thereafter
following, whether it be Whitsunday or Martinmas, and so forth, ten merks at
each term, Whitsunday and Martinmas, aye, and
until the
said forty merks
be thankfully paid.
The said Lauchlan shall clothe his daughter honestly as
effeirs, and the
costs thereof not to be counted in the
said forty merks
; and
he shall hold and sustain his said daughter honestly in his own house two years,
if
it please the said Donald that she remain so long with her father.
And the
said Donald
is become loyal and true son in
service, and in
all things
to the
said Lauchlan
as
to his carnal father for
all
the
days
of
his
life
;
and the
said Lauchlan is become loyal and true
father in all defence, help, and supply,
for all the days of his
life to the said Donald,
as a
carnal father should be to
his son.
And to the fulfilling, firm, and faithful keeping of all the points above
written, the said Lauchlan and the said Donald have sworn the great oath, the
holy gospel being touched, all fraud, guile, cavillation, and frivolous exceptions
being excluded and byput.
And for ihe more
security, to this indenture the
foresaid Lauchlan and Donald
have interchangeably affixed to their seals
; and
because
the
said Donald had no seal proper of his own, he has procured with
instance the seal of an honourable man, William Thane of Cawdor, to be affixed
for him, at day and place before written.
The following shows the tax ordered to be
levied by the
Parliament, held at Edinburgh on the 21st March
1483, on

then importance and wealth

I summoned peremptorily by open proclamation,

William, Lord Crichtoun
:
And, moreover, the

foresaid, I passed with the said letter
and these witnesses, Thomas Scot, John Fraser, John Cowy,
William Johnson, one of the bailies of Tain
; Thomas Rede,
a bailie of Cromarty
; Magnus Vans, burgess of Inverness
;
and Alexander Sutherland, brother and familiar follower
to
the said Lord Crichtoun, to the town of Tain in Ross, &c."
This William, Lord
Crichton, was a man of great influ-
ence during the reign of James III.
His crime was treason-
able correspondence with
the English
Court.
In 1483, in
dread of his
life, he sought sanctuary within the girth of
Tain, and lived in the Vicar's house.
He of course did not
obey the summons, and was in 1484 outlawed in consequence,
and his estates were forfeited. He resided for several years in
Tain
; and afterwards met the King at Inverness, and was,
in some degree, reconciled to him.
He seems to have died
in poverty.

JAMES IV:
1488-1513. PART FIRST,
Andrew
Fercharson
having founded a
cliaplainship
in
the Parish Church of Inverness to
St Peter, and provided
certain acres, houses, and annual rents, within and without
the burgh for its support, presents thereto the discreet man
Thomas
Copland.
His presentation
is dated at Inverness
22d April 1490.
Thereafter, Andrew, Bishop of Moray, at
Inverness on the 20th July 1490, commands John M'Cellan,
vicar of Fernway, or any of his chaplains, to invest, induct,
and appoint the said Thomas in
said
office,
to
defend him
therein and to furnish him with
the
fruits
thereof.
Docu-
ments exactly similar have already appeared in full.
John Grant, one of the bailies of Inverness, on the I5th
July
1490,
infefts
the Chaplain of the Altar of St Peter
within the Parish Church of Inverness, in an annual of six
merks, granted by Andrew Farquhar's son styled Alderman
of the said Burgh, in the following terse and concise terms
:
To
all and sundry to whose knowledge these^ present letters shall come, John
the Grant one
of
the bailies
of the burgh
of Inverness sends greeting in God
everlasting
: To you all I make it known that Andrew Fercharson, Alderman of
the said burgh, not compelled, strained, nor seduced, but of his own benevolence
and free will, made pure and simple resignation into my hands
as
bailie, into
the favours of the Holy Apostle St Peter
in the Parish Kirk of Inverness, and
to Sir Thomas Coupland, perpetual chaplain to the same, of six merks of annual
rent yearly, to be paid of all and sundry the foresaid Andrew Fercharson's lands
lying within the said burgh and without, of his own proper conquest, for services
to be done weekly by the foresaid Sir Thomas and his
successors
for ever, at
the said altar, that
is for to say, that he and his successors shall say mass all
Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, at the same, and to be at all founded services
without and within the said Kirk at even song, high mass, all festival times in
the year, at the Roodmass
of Friday, and our Ladymass on Saturday, and to
pray for the
souls
of
the
said Andrew, his wife, his forbears and friends for
ever
:
And this
I make
it known to
all whom it effeirs, me to have given the
said state
of six merks of annual yearly to the said Sir Thomas
as said
is.
In
witness of the which thing I have appended to this my letter of sasine, my seal at
the said biirgh the 15th day of July the year of God, one thousand four hundred
and ninety years, before these witnesses Sir Thomas Johnson, chaplain, John
Alexanderson,
William Dalcous, David Skynner, and Thomas Cuk,
servitor,
with others sundry.
In a bond between the Thane of Cawdor and Mackintosh,
anent the marriage of Huchone, Allan's son, dated, Cawdor,
20th August 1490, Sir Marteyne, Dean of Inverness, is one
of the witnesses.
In the year 1492, in a question regarding the marches of
Croy and Kildrummie betwixt Andrew, bishop
of Moray,
and Hugh Pose of Kilravock, Master Alexander Sutherland,
vicar of Inverness, formerly referred to, is one of the arbiters.

.

Under the great seal. ...
At
Inverness,
the
10th day of the month of
November, in the year of the Lord 1492, and of our reign the 5th.
The following extract from Tytler's History may be read
with advantage in reference
to the period now arrived
at,
the early part of James the Fom^th's reign
:
For a considerable time past the condition of the Highlands, and the reduction
of such wild and remote districts under
a more regular form of government
than that to which they had hitherto submitted, appears to have been a subject
which
occupied a large share of the
attention and anxiety of the
sovereign.
To
attach to
his
interest the principal chiefs of
these provinces
;
to overawe
and subdue the petty Princes who affected independence
;
to carry into their
territories,
hitherto
too
exclusively
governed by
their own
capricious
or
tyrannical
institutions, the same system of
a severe, but
regular and
rapid
administration of
civil and criminal justice, which had beeu established
in
his
Lowland dominions, was the laudable object of the King ; and for this purpose
he
succeeded, with that energy and activity which remarkably distinguished
him, in opening up an intercourse with many of the leading men of the northern
counties.
With the Captain of the Clan Chattan, Duncan Mackintosh
; with
Ewan, the son of Alan, Captain of the Clan Cameron
; with Campbell of Glen-
urcha
; the Macgilleouns of Dowart and Lochbuy ; Mackane of Ardnamurchan ;
the Lairds of Mackenzie and Grant
; and the Earl of Huntly, a baron of the
most extensive power in those northern districts—he appears to have been
in
habits
of constant and regular communication,
rewarding them by presents,
in the shape either of money or of grants of land, and securing their services in
reducing to obedience
su^ch of their fellow-chieftains as proved contumacious,
or
actually
rose into
rebellion.
But James was not content with
this.
He
rightly judged that the personal presence of the sovereign in those distant parts
of his dominions would be attended with salutary effects
,• and in 1490, on two
different occasions, he rode, accompanied by his chief counsellors and the lords
of his household, from Perth across the "Mounth," the term
applied
to the
extensive chain of mountains which extends across the country, from the border
of the Mearns to the head of Loch Kannoch.
In 1493, although much occupied
with other
cares
and
concerns,
he found time
to
penetrate twice into the
Highlands, proceeding as far as Dunstaffnage and Mingarry in Ardnamurchan,
and in the
succeeding year, such was the indefatigable activity with which he
executed his public duties,
that he thrice visited the
Isles.
The
first
of these
voyages, which took place in April and May, was conducted with great state.
It
afforded the youthful monarch an opportunity of combining business and
amusement,
of
gratifying his passion for sailing and hunting, of investigating
the state of the fisheries, of fitting ovit his barges for defence as well as pleasure,
and of inducing his nobles to build and furnish, at their own expense, vessels in
which they riiight accompany their sovereign.
It had the effect also of impi-ess-
ing upon the inhabitants of the
Isles a salutary idea of the wealthy grandeur
and military power of the King.
The rapidity with which he travelled from
place to place, the success and expedition with which he punished all who dared
to oppose him, his generosity to his friends and attendants, and
his gay and con-
descending familiarity with the lower
classes of his subjects, all combined to
I

163
increase his popularity, and to consolidate and unite, by the bonds of equal laws
and affectionate allegiance, the remotest parts of the kingdom.
At Tarbet,
in Cantire, he
re]xiired the
fort originally built by Bruce, and
established an emporium for his shipping, transporting thither his artillery, laying
in a stock
of gunpowder, and carrying along with him his master gunners,
in
whose training and
practice he appears, from the payments in the
treasurer's
books, to have busied himself with much perseverance and enthusiasm.
Those
warlike measures were generally attended with the best
effects
; most
of the
chieftains
readily submitted to a prince who could carry hostilities
within
a
few
days
into the
heart
of
their country, and
attack them in
their island
fastnesses with a force which they found it vain to resist.
One only. Sir John
of the
Isles, had the folly to defy the
royal
vengeance,
ungrateful
for that
repeated lenity with which his treasons had been already pardoned.
His great
power
in the
Isles probably induced him to believe that the king would not
venture to drive him to
extremities
; but
in this he was
disappointed.
King
James instantly summoned him to stand his trial for treason
; and in a Parlia-
ment, which assembled at Edinburgh soon after the king's return from the north,
this formidable rebel was stripped of his power, and
his lands and possessions
forfeited to the Crown.

JAMES
IV,
1488-1513. PART
SECOND.
The king was
at Inverness
in the month of November
1493, as appears by the following order, which is endorsed
—*' The
king's
letters
directed
to
the Sheriff of Ross to
charge all the merchants and inhabitants of Tain,
Suther-
land, Ross, and Caithness, to present all their goods market-
able to the burgh of Inverness."
The Sheriff is Hugh Ross
of Balnagown, and one of the witnesses
to his execution is
I Angus Macculloch, a member of the ancient family of Mac-
culloch of the Plaids
;
James, by the grace ot God, king ot
Scots,—To our Sheriff of Ross and his
I deputes
;
Greeting
:
Forasmuch as it is humbly meaned and comjplained unto us
I by our lieges the alderman, bailies, council, and community of our burgh of In-
' verness, that whereas the goods customable
passing furth of Koss,
Caithness,
and Sutherland should be brought before our officers of customs and searchers of
our said burgh, and there our customs and duties of the same paid, nevertheless,
the persons inhabiting the bounds
foresaid have,
of
long time
byegone, not
broughtjthe said goods to our said burgh of Inverness, but to the burgh of Tain ;
and the customs and duties pertaining to us thereof intromitted with and up-
taken and withholden from us by the
bailies and community of Tain, in great
prejudice to us, and heavy damage and scaith to our said burgh of Inverness, and
hurting of the old privileges of the same, as is alleged
: Our will is heretor, and
; we charge you
strictly and command that
ye,
incontinent,
these our letters
I
seen, pass, and in our name and authority command and charge all and sundry,
our lieges inhabiting the said bounds of Tain, Sutherland, and Caithness, that
they, in time coming, come to the market of Inverness with
all manner of mer-
chandise, and
that as
to their principal market, under the pain of
escheating
of the said goods, unto the time that they show,
if they have i^rivileges or free-
doms to the contrary of old
: And this in no wise leave undone, as ye will answer
to us upon the execution of your office, and under all the hurt, pain, charge, and
offence that after may follow
:

letters, by you duly exe-
cuted and endorsed, again to the bearers.

The 12th day of May,
I, David Koss, Sheriff in this part, have made execution
of these our
sovereign
lord's
letters in
the town
of Tain, in
all and sundry
points and
ai'ticles contained in the present
letters, after the form of the same
before these witnesses
:—Angus Macculloch of the Plaids, Walter Ross, Donald
Reed, and Hugh*Alexanderson, bailies of Tain.
In witness of the which I have
affixed my seal.
The
following
discharge
by
the
Abbot
of Cambus-
kenneth, to the Baron of Kilravock, relates to some question
which had been before the
Circuit Court
at
Inverness.
It
may be
observed
that the
Chartulary of Cambuskenneth,
an elegant and well-edited volume, was
lately presented to
the members
of the Grampian Club by
the
Marquis
of
Bute
:
We, Henry, by the permission
of God, Abbot of Cambuskenneth, and trea-
surer to our sovereign lord for the time, quitclaim, and discharge Hugh Rose of
Kilravock and his borrows (sureties)
; that
is to say. Sir Alexander Gordon of
Migmar, Henry Chene of Essilmont, and John the Ross of Auchinlosk, of the
sum of £42, owing by them to us in our sovereign lord's name, after the tenor
of their obligation, for a composition made with us
by the said Hugh in the
Justice Aire of Inverness, because our sovereign lord has by his letters remitted
and forgiven
to
the
said Hugh
the
said
sum,
and
has
taken
contentation
therefor, as the said letters bear, which we have
received to show upon count
for
our
warrant
:
And,
therefore, we
discharge by these
presents
the
said
Hugh and his sureties foresaid of the
said sum, and of
their
obligation made
to lis thereupon for ever.
In witness hereof we have subscribed this quitclaim
with our hand, and
affixed our signet
to the
same, at Stirling
the 8th day of
February the year of God 1494 years.
By precept of clare
constat,

At
Inverness
on
the same
day
the king granted the
following remission to the Thane of Cawdor, John his son,
William Dallas of Cantray, and William Dallas of Bud-
gate
:
James, by the grace of God, King of Scots, to all and sundry our
justices,
sheriffs,
justice
clerks,
coroners, and
their
deputes,
and
all
others,
our
officers, lieges, and subjects whom it effeirs, to whose knowledge these our letters

April, the year of God
1493 years, William Thane of Cawdor, John
of Cawdor,
his son and apparent
heir, William Dallas of Cantray, and William Dallas
of Budgate were accused
and convicted
of
certain criminal actions committed by them, and doom given
upon them to have been beheaded therefor, nevertheless we therefore moved of
pity, considering and understanding they were ever our true lieges, and obedient
to our laws, and never found guilty
of before, granted to them their
li^^es, heri-
tages, and goods, to live and remain in time to come our true lieges, like as they
did of before the giving of the said doom upon them, and thei-efore of our special
grace, favour, and authority royal, have remitted, and by these our letters remit
to them and each of them
all actions, criminal and
civil, committed and done
by them or any of them in time bygone, before the giving of the said doom upon
them, and cancel and annul the said doom, and
all sentence and
process that

PART THIRD.
The grasping family of Argyle about this time began
to
look to the north
for
seizures.
They
did
establish them-
selves in Cawdor, but the attempt to settle in the rich terri-
tory of the Aird lasted but for a time.
The charter of which

ditarily to me, with
their sundry pertinents lying
in the
earldom
of Moray,
and within the sheriffdom of Inverness, for a certain sum of money paid to me
in my urgent necessity by the
said Lord Earl.
...
In testimony of which
matter my seal is appended to this my present charter at
Inverness,
the 29th
day of
the month of
January,
in the year of
the Lord 1497, before these wit-
nesses
:—Walter Murray, John Murray, Lord Andrew Cunyngham,
rector
of
Lochow; Finlay Macknab of Powayne
; Charles M 'Arthur, Archibald Uchiltre,
Donald M'Clachlane and Duncan Stewart, son and heir apparent
of
Dougall
Stewart of Deyapyn, with divers others.
From the Kilravock papers the following account is taken
of the " Hership of Cromartie "
:—" Doule M'Gilliecallum
and William Alansone spoiled and carried off from the lands
of Master Alexander
Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty, 600
cows and oxen, each worth
13s 4d,
80
horses,
each worth
26s 8d, 1000 sheep, each worth 2s, 200
swine,
each worch
3s, with
plenishing
to
the
valae
of £300
; and
also
500
bolls of victual and £300 of the mails of the Sheriff's lands.
The Chiefs
of Clan
Chattan and
the
Baron of Kilravock
became security for these persons, and on
the 1st February
1497, the Lords of Council sitting at Inverness, pronounced
decree against
Kilravock,
as
being
probably more
easily
made amenable.
Kilravock endeavours to operate his relief
against the Mackintoshes
in
various
ways, but with what
success is not known.
The debt established by the Urqu-
harts against the Roses, 800 merks,
was
at
length
settled
by bond,
dated at
Inverness, 20th November
1501."
It
would appear from the following, however, that very shortly
after, the Mackintoshes
lost or yielded
their rights
to
the
Baronies of Urquhart and
Glenmoriston
to
the
Laird
of
Kilravock, which
was a heavy
price indeed when it seems
clear from the account in
the History of the Mackintoshes
that the quarrel with the
Sheriff of Cromarty was none of
their seekino:

the
Incarnation
of
the Lord

the month
of November, in the second indiction and in
the 7th year of the pontificate of
the most holy father in Christ and
our Lord,
Lord Alexander
Sixth, by Divine Providence,
Pojie,
in presence of me notary
public and the underwritten witnesses, the prudent man Walter Hay, personally
constituted
procurator
for
the within written
purpose, of the honourable man
Alexander Hay of Mayn, by his command as to me notary was sufficiently evident,
came to the lands of
Culcabock and Knockintinnel, lying within
the Sheriffdom
of Inverness, and set forth in name of
the said Alexander of Mayn, that it had
very lately reached the ears of
the said
Alexander, that
the discreet man Lord
William Paterson, unjustly received and obtained to the loss and prejudice of
said
Alexander,
a
certain
pretended
sasine
of said lands pertaining as
he asserted
hereditarily to him the
said
Alexander, by what
title, as the
said procurator
.
asserted, he knew not
:
Wherefore because of the premises, the foresaid procu.
rator desiring that the mandate committed to him in this part be given
effect to
by due execution upon the soil of said lands, by all the proper modes by which it
ought, and that the said alleged and pretended sasine received by the said Lord
William as premised, be made void and of no effect
; by the placing of earth and
stone in a dish, he
deseised, ejected, and as the manner is divested the said Lord
William of the said lands of Culcabock and Knockintinnel, with the pertinents,
by the breaking and destruction of the
said dish
: Protesting that the said pre-
tended
sasine
so received should not in
future prejudice the
said Alexander
and
his
heirs
: On
all and sundry
which,
the said Walter Hay, in name
as
above,
demanded
of
me,
notary
public underwritten, one or more public in-
struments to be made for him
: These things were done
as above on the soil of
said lands, at nine o'clock in the forenoon or thereabouts, in the year, month, day,
indiction,
and pontificate
as
above
:
Present there—Thomas
Fold,
William
Kannach,
Nichol Thomson,
John
Tailzour,
and
William,
with
divers
other
witnesses
to
the
premises, entreated and
speciaily required.
And
I, Thomas
Guthrie,
M.A., priest of the diocese of Brechin, notary public by holy apostolic
and
royal authority, forasmuch as
I, along with the forenamed
witnesses, was
present at the premises all and sundry, while thus, as is premised, they were acted
said and done, and saw, knew and heard, and took note, that they all and sun-
dry were thus
done,
I, therefore, have made thereupon this present public in-
strument
written with my own hand, and have signed
it
with my
usual and
accustomed sign and name, being called on and requested so to do for faith and
testimony of the premises.

JAMES
IV.
1488 1513. PART FOURTH.
In 1499 King James granted at
Inverness
to Mackay of
Stratlinaver a charter
of which
the
following
is
the sub-
stance
;
James, &c. , Know that we, for the good, faithful, and gi-atuitous service done
to us by our beloved
servant, Odo alias Y. Mackay of Strathnaver, both in the
time of peace and war, by services done and to be done, have given, granted, and
by this present charter confirmed to the said Odo Mackay and his heirs, all and
sundry the lands under-written,
viz., the lands of Armidill, Strathie, Rynivee,
Kynald,
Gollesby,
Dybrid,
Cattak,
Bronych,
Kilchallumkill
in
Strabroray,
Davoch-Lochnaver, Davoch-Ereboll, and two tenths of the land of Stromay, with
the mill of Rynald with the pertinents, lying in Caithness and Sutherland, within
our shire
of
Inverness, which lands and
mill, with
their pertinents belonged
formerly by inheritance to Alexander Sutherland, and now pertain to us, having
lawfully fallen into our hands, by reason of the
forfeiture and execution of the
said Alexander Sutherland,
convicted of
treason.
Given,
&c., at Inverness, on
the 4th day of November, A.D. 1499, and 12th of our reign.
In
the
same
year
on
the
20th
of
October,
Andrew,
Bishop of Moray, presented Sir John Matheson to the Chap-
laincy of St John the Baptist, within the Parish Church of
Inverness, on the nomination of Hugh Fraser, Lord of Lovat.
Mr Anderson, in his history of the Erasers, states— " From
the frequent presentations to
this altarage by the family of
Lovat, it is not unlikely that the patronage
to the Parish
Church,
still
alternately enjoyed with the Crown, had
its
origin."
The carrying through of the service of the heiresses of the
Thane of Cawdor
is
partly shown by
the instrument after
given.
Though it is a lengthy document it is interesting as
showing
the
formalities
prior
to
holding
the
Court
of
Inquisition
:
In the name of God, Amen.
By
this
present public instrument,
let it be
clearly known to
all, that in the year of
the incarnation of the Lord 1499, on
the 27th day of the month of January, the third
indiction, in the year
of the
Pontificate
of
the most Holy Father in Christ and our Lord, Lord Alexander,
by the will of the divine clemency, Pope
Sixth, and in
the
12th year
of the
reign of the most powerful and illustrious lord, ovir lord King of
Scots, James
4th, in

JAMES IV.
1488-1513.
PART FIFTH
The sitting as judge of John Stirling was questioned by the
heirs male of the Laird of Cawdor,
and
they
took instru-
ments in
the hands of a notary-public
within
the Court-
room of the burgh of Inverness,
on the 11th of February
1499, and the notary thereupon expede the following instru-
ment
:
In the Court of the Sheriff of Inverness, held, begun, and affirmed by the noble-
man, John Sterlyng, Sheriff in
that
part, by virtue of
the commission
of our
supreme lord the king, specially deputed to
this end, in the Court-room of
the
Burgh
of
Inverness,
and in presence of me notaiy public, and of the witnesses
under-written, there was
personally
constituted the
circumspect man, Master
John Caldor, precentor of the Cathedral Church of Koss, prolocutor of the hon-
ourable man, William, Thane of Caldor, and of Andrew Caldor, his son and heir
apparent, as he asserted
; After reading of
a certain breve
of the chapel of our
lord the king, obtained by the noble and potent
lord, Archibald, Earl of Argyle,
and tutor
dative
of Muriel Caldor, daughter and heiress reputed (asser^e) of the
late John Caldor, of the lands
of
the Lordship of
Caldor, the
said prolocutor
alleged that the foresaid John Stirlyng, Sheriff in that part, was a suspected judge.
for and because of this, that he was the servant and friend to the said Archibald,
Earl of Argyle, and to his deceased father, and that said Sheriff in that part was
in the power of said Earl, in so far as he was andis Senescal to our supreme lord the
king, and said Earl is master of the chamber to our foresaid lord the king
; And
that said Sheriff in that part, could not judicially engage in the serving of breves
of our supreme
lord the
king,
except in defect of the Sheriff Principal of said
•sheriffdom,
as, he asserted,
is plainly cautioned and held in law in the third
book of the Regiam Magistatem, where it thus says—The judge delegate cannot
interpone his
offices,
unless
the
judge
ordinary had
first
been
refused, and
also when he who
succeeds
in
law is thought to have a just cause by reason
of the ignorance of the other, but it is not so in this case, in which a commission
has been granted not
because of
a just cause it is null
; Wlierefore, it is clearly
proved there was no cause of ignorance nor of suspicion in the principal Sheriff,
and at
first, why
the
cause
was
not devolved upon him, and
said prolocutor
sought that these exceptions be admitted and sustained throughout the court,

172
INVERNESSIANA.
and said Sheriff commanded parties to be removed, and in said court by his asses-
sors sought the declaration of
said exceptions, and again commanded parties to
enter,
and
found
those
exceptions
invalid,
and
so declared
to
the
party
;
and
the
said
prolocutor
adhering
to
his
first
protestation,
for remedy
of
law,
for
these
rational
exceptions,
proposed
by
him,
and
not
admitted,
has protested, as far as he could, in not affirming the court
(against the ruling
of the court)
; On all and sundry which the said Master John, in his character of
procurator as above, asked to be made for him by me notary public underwritten
public instruments one or more.
These things were done in the foresaid Court-
house at eleven o'clock forenoon or thereabout, in
the
year, day, month, indic-
tion, and
pontificate as above.
Present
there—the reverend
father in Christ,
Andrew, Bishop of Moray
; John Cumyn of Ernside
; William Munro of Foulis ;
John Ogilvy,
Sheriff-Depute of
Inverness
; John Kennedy ; David Dunbar of
Durris
; "William Dolas of Cantray
: Gilbert Waus, clerk
; and Lord John Ding-
wall, notary public, with divers others, witnesses to the premises, likewise called
and asked.
The Baron of Kilravock also took instruments in a notary's
hands, who wrote the following deed
:
The honourable man, John Ogilvy,
Sheriff of Inverness, in that
part
spe-
cially deputed, gave to me notary public underwritten, to be
read,
a
charter,
written on parchment, and sealed with the great seal of our supreme Lord the
King, and which
seal,
as was
apparent, was torn
at the
bottom, of
a sixth
part ; of the conjunct infeftment as in said charter, is more fully and
effica-
ciously contained,
belonging
to the late John
Caldor,
son and
heir
of
the
late apparent William Thane of Caldor, and also of Elizabeth, relict of the said
late John Caldor, and to the longest liver of them, and also to
their heirs, law-
fully procreated betwixt them of the lands of the half of Rait, and of the lands
of the two Banchors, with all their pertinents, which
charter from end to end
I read, beginning thus
:—James, by the Grace of God, King of Scots, to all men of
his whole realm, cleric and laic, greeting,
&c.
; and ends thus
:—At Inverness,
the 3d day of the month
of February, in the year of the Lord 1497, and of
our reign the 10th.
After the reading of which charter, the
foresaid Sheriff ••
Depute gave, and delivered, by his own hands, said charter, to Hugh Rose, baron
of Kilravock, as procurator and factor of the foresaid Elizabeth
Rose, relict of
said late John Caldor, and the said Hugh Rose received said charter as factor
and procurator
of the
foresaid Elizabeth
Rose,
and
asked
to
be
delivered
him by the said depute
foresaid, letters of sasine, together with instruments,
documents, and
evidents, made
thereupon.
Then
the
said
depute asserted
that he had not got any, with the exception of
that
charter, and if
he had or
could obtain any he would deliver and give them, as he gave and delivered the
charter.
The said Hugh Rose
protested that the want of said letters and in-
struments,
and
specially
of an obligation made and contracted betwixt the
said Hugh Rose, on the one
part, and
the
aforesaid William Thane
of Caldor
on the
other, should
not hereafter be to his prejudice or that of the aforesaid
Elizabeth,
considering that
he, the
said Hugh Rose of Kilravock, desired and
sought said obligation and letters,
evidents,
documents, and instruments,
be-
longing to the
said Elizabeth
Rose,
according
to
the command,
form,
and
effect of the letters of our supreme lord the King.
Upon which all and sundry
the said Hugh Rose asked to be made for him by me notary public under written
one or more public instruments.
These things were done
in the street of the
Parish Church of Inverness, at the hour
of twelve noon
or thereabouts,
year,
month, day, indiction, and pontificate as above.
Present there—the circumspect
men John Macgillelane,
perpetual chaplain
of the Parish Church
of
Inver-
ness ; Thomas Gordoun
in Strade ; William Sutherland and Andrew Curroixr,
witnesses to the premises called and si^ecially required.
At
Inverness, upon
the
26th
October 1499,
the King
issues new letters to Alexander Lord Gordon, and others, his
Sheriffs
in
that
part,
to
levy and
distrain
the goods of
Donald Corbett, and many others, who
spuilzied the lands
in Ardmeanoch and Kedcastle, while Kilravock was Captain
thereof,
in consequence of
the former
letters
directed
to
Hugh Ross of Balnagown
not having been implemented.

afterwards part of the thanage of Cawdor, was an important
one.
The summer shealling was Dalmigavie, and the lands
stretched from the burn of Hohn to Inverfarigaig, with the
exception of one small piece of land called " The Dowinche,"
near the mill of Borlum, part of the Castle lands, and pro-
bably the lands of Ballichernoch.
The Mackintoshes were
at
this time
increasing
their possessions, and having just
failed with Urquhart and
Glenmoriston,
had
almost
ac-
quired Durris.
Shaw,
in referring to the following
document, being a
reference betwixt the Dunbars and Mackintoshes, dated
at
Inverness, 20th June 1499, says :—
From this writing appears something of
the nature of bonds of manrent and
service, which at that time and afterwards became frequent. Some of these bonds
were obligations granted by a clan to their chief, som-e were granted by vassals
to their superiors, and some were an obligation to pay a kind of black-mail or
fee, to preserve themselves and their lands from harm.
Such was Cumnock's
giving
the town
of Durris to
Ferchard,
to preserve
his
brother's lands and
his own, from the ravage
of the Clan Chattan.
But
I do not find that
this
contract was implemented.
From the deed it appears that Mackintosh owed service to
five persons and four families, viz.
:—The Archbishop Duke
of Ross (the King's brother), the Earl of Mar, the Bishop
of Moray, the Earl of Huntly, and his son Alexander.
The
original contract upon which this reference followed, as well
as the reference
are, with other valua})le papers of the old
Sheriffs of Moray, in the possession of their representative
Guthrie of Scotscalder.
The whole would form an
inter-
esting volume.
Follows the " writing" referred to
:
At Inv^ness, June 20th 1499, Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, knight, and Fer-
chard Mackintosh, captain of the Clan Chattan, have chosen the persons follow-
ing, and Andrew, Bishop of Moray, oversman, to agree them in
all isoints con-
tained in
a contract made by umquhile Sir Alex. Dunbar of the Westfield, and
Sir James of Cumnock, his son and heir, under their seals, and Ferchard Mackin-
tosh, captain of the Clan Chattan, and Duncan and Ferchard, his sons, under their
seals.
The
said
Sir James has chosen JMr Patrick Dunbar, parson of Kilmuir,
and Sir John Annesly, parson of Kirkmichael, canons of the Cathedral of Ross
;

AVm. Alexanderson and Donald Malcolmson, which i>ersons ordain,
that
Sir
James, betwixt this and Michaelmas next, shall get a resignation from his brother,
David Dunbar, of the town of Durris with the pertinents into the king's hands,
and take them by charter and sasine, and give them by charter and sasine to the
said Ferchard heritably, for service made and to be made, and
all this against
Michaelmas next; for the which the said Ferchard, at the sasine-taking, shall give
to Sir James and his heirs a letter of manrent for him and his heirs, in best form,

Earl of Mar, to
the

Alexander excepted
: And Sir James' son

the

; and Ferchard's
son Duncan, and failing him any other lawful son of his, shall marry the daugh-

Alexander whom God assoilzie, or of David Dunbar ;
and for payment of
the
tocher, Ferchard shall give 300
merks,
or so many cows as my Lord
of Moray
shall ordain.
And to take away any controversy that may happen between them,
their kin or friends, they have chosen Mr Gavin Dunbar, dean of Moray, David
Dunbar, and Alexander Urquhart of Burdsyards, on Sir James' part, and Mr John
Spence, Hutcheon Rose, baron of Kilravock, and John Grant of Freuchie on Fer-
chard's
part,

JAMES IV.
1488-1513.
FART NINTH.
The wise and moderate measures of the King up to 1499,
according
to
Tytler, " were
succeeded
by
proceedings
so
severe as
to border on
injustice.
The charters which had
been granted during the last six years
to the vassals of the
Isles, were summarily revoked.
Archibald, Earl of Argjde,
was installed in the office of lieutenant, with the ample and
invidious power of leasing out the
entire
lordship
of the
Isles.
The
ancient
proprietors
and
their
vassals
were
violently
expelled from
their
hereditary
property,
whilst
Argyle and other royal favourites appear to have been en-
riched by new grants of their estates and lordships.
We are
not
to wonder
that
such
harsh proceedings
were
loudly
reprobated.
The inhabitants
saw
with
indignation
their
rightful masters exposed to insult and indigence, and at last
broke into open rebellion.
Donald Dhu, grandson of John,
lord of the Isles, had been shut up for forty years a solitary
captive
in
the
Castle of
Inchconnal.
His mother was a
daughter of the first Earl of Argyle
; and although there is
no doubt that both he and his
father were
illegitimate, the
affection of the Islesmen overlooked the blot in his scutcheon,
and
fondly
turned
to him
as
the true heir of Ross and
Innisgail.
To
reinstate him
in
his
rights, and place him
upon the throne of the Isles, was
the object of the present
rebellion.
A party, led by the Maclans of Glencoe, broke
into
his dungeon,
liberated him
from
his
captivity, and
carried him in safety to the Castle of Torquil Macleod in the
Lews, whilst measures were concerted throughout the wide
extent of the Isles for the
establishment of their independ-
ence,
and
the destruction of the
regal power.
Although
James received early intelligence of the meditated insurrec-
tion, and laboured
by every method
to
dissolve the union
amongst
its confederated
chiefs,
it now burst
forth
with
destructive fury.
Badenoch was wasted with all the ferocity
of Highland warfare, Inverness given to the flames
; and so
widely and rapidly did the contagion of independence spread
throughout the Isles, that it demanded the most prompt and
decisive measures
to
arrest
it.
But James' power, though
shook, was too deeply rooted to be thus destroyed."
On 15tli March 1503, Parliament ordained inter alia
:—
Item.—That there be Justice-Deputes
for the
Isles and

INVERNESSIANA.
183
Sheriifs, and the ythat are Justices and Sheriffs for the North
Isles to sit in Inverness or Dingwall.
Item.—It
is
thought
expedient
that the lands betwixt
Badenoch and Lorn, which are
called Durwart and Glen-
towart, come
to Perth;
Mamore and Lochaber
to Inver-
ness, &c.
Item.— It
is statute and ordained that the Justice aire of
all the three Sheriffdoms— that
is
to
say, Inverness, Ross,
and CaithnesSj be held in the town of Inverness.
In 1503, the parish clerk of Inverness has some dispute
with the parishioners as to his salary.
The matter comes at
length before the Church Courts, and on 20th July 1504
is
issued the judgment following
:
In the name of Christ, we, John Spence, succentor of the Cathedral Church of
Moray, and official of Moray, sitting in judgment in the case by Thomas Foulis,
parish clerk of the parish church of the burgh of Inverness, alleging that he
ought to receive from every burgess of said burgh, who has divers ploughs in
various
places or in
various
tacks or cultivated lands, for every plough under
cultivation within the limits of said burgh or without, wheresoever, one firlot of
grain, actor, on the one part, contrary and against John Ogilvy, Provost, and the
burgesses of foresaid burgh, defenders, on the other, alleging the contrary : Having
first learnt and heard the allegations
of the foresaid parties, and attestations,
depositions, and sayings of witnesses
; and also the use and custom of the said
burgh, held, observed, and approved hitherto as far as there
is any record, and
the other merits of the case being seen, considered, understood, and fully
dis-
cussed,
observed, and to be duly observed, we, by this our final sentence, which
we make known in these writings, with advice of our assessors and men learned
in the law, pronounce, decern, and declare the said Thomas Foulis,
clerk, to
have clear title and just right to one complete firlot of grain or victual, according,
as has been the custom of said burgh from every burgess thereof, or, at
least, to
receive one whole gallon for every Sunday yearly throughout the year, to be
received and exacted by said clerk along with his other accustomed income and
offerings, and that
notwithstanding the plurality of the burgesses cultivating
or labouring the lands or landward tacks of said ploughs
; and also the cottars
of said bui'gesses shall satisfy yearly to the foresaid clerk for themselves as the
custom is, and the foresaid burgesses and their cottars we ordain yearly to make
payment in the premises,
all and sundry, as aforesaid, to the said Thomas Foulis,
parish clerk, as the fee of his office for the administration thereof, at the
usual
yearly terms
: This our final sentence was read, carried, and pronounced in these
writings, in the Parish Church of Inverness, foresaid at 10 o'clock A.M. or there-
abouts on the 10th day of December in the year of our Lord 1503, the seventh
indiction, and in the 12th year of the pontificate of the most holy father in
Christ and our Lord, Lord Alexander the
sixth, by divine providence,
Pope.

this public form and have signed it with my accustomed and wonted sign, name,

INVERNESSIANA,
In 1505 an insurrection had again broken
out, but the
King's measures, according
to
Tytler, " produced a speedy
and extensive effect in dissolving the confederacy.
Maclean
of Dowart, Macquarrie of Ulva, with Macniell of Barra, and
Mackinnon, offered their submission, and were received into
favour; and the succeeding year (1506) witnessed the utter
destruction of Torquil Macleod,
the great head of the re-
bellion, whose Castle of Stornoway in Lewis was stormed by
Huntly ;
whilst Donald Dhu, the captive upon whose aged
head his vassals had made
this desperate attempt
to place
the crown of the Isles, escaping the grip of the conqueror,
fled to Ireland, where he soon after died."
The following is a copy of the Sheriff's indorsation on the
summons in the process of treason against Torquil Macleod
of the Lews
:
The 24th day of the month of December the year of God 1505 years,
I, John
Ogilvy,
Sheriff-depute ot Inverness, past with these our sovereign lord's letters
and sought Torquil Macleod of the Lewis, and because I could not apprehend him
personally, and there was no sure passage to me to his dwelling place, I past to the
market cross of the burgh of Inverness, at eleven hours before noon, and there, by
open iDroclamation made at the market-cross, I summoned, warned, and charged
the
said Torquil Macleod of the Lewis to compear before our sovereign Lord
the King, or his Justice, in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh the 3d day of February
next to come, in the hour of cause, with continuation of days, to answer to our
sovereign lord or his justice for the treasonable art, part, and assistance taken and
done with Donald
Isla, bastard son to Angus of the
Isles, bastard, taking part
with him and invading our sovereign
lord's lieges
of the
Isles, and destroying
them to the
effect that the said Donald should be Lord of the Isles
; and upon
all points and
articles in these our sovereign lord's letters and after the form
of the same,
and this
I did before these witnesses John of Chalmer,
Robert
Innes, Alex. Michelsone, John Auchinlek, alderman of Inverness
; John Cuth
bert, John Vaus,
bailies
of the said burgh
; JamesDonaldsone, Alex. Adeson,
Henry Auchinlek,
Patersone, John of Rutherford, Sir William Patersone,
parson
of
Boleskine, and
Sir John
ke,
chaplain and notary public, and
others divers, and for the more witnessing of
this execution
I have affixed my
signet to these presents.
The legal proceedings of the burgh of Inverness against
the other northern burghs, which were for the time silenced
by the troubles in the north, were resumed in
1508, and
it
is fortunate that the very
full evidence then produced has
been preserved.
Even the ages of most of the witnesses are
given

by John Ogilvy,
Sheriff-Depute, the 28th day of May, the year
of God 1508.

wall occupied no freedom, but at the licence of the alderman, bailies, and council
of Inverness, and that he saw Earl Alexander of Ross make supplication to the
alderman and bailies of Inverness to make a certain (number) of Dingw.all free
to occupy their freedom.
And confirmed the same as to Tain.
"William, Thane of Calder, deponed that the burgh of Inverness ever occupied

of Ross, the burghs of Ross, Moray and
Caithness, and all the tenants of the same, come to the Sheriff-Court of Inver-
ness, and who were absent he caused poind them without favour, and attour
that the said Sir Thomas Stewart caused escheat
all the goods that came not
to the king's burgh of Inverness, and that Sir Thomas Stewart held the chamber-
lainaire in Inverness, and caused
all the forestallers of Dingwall, Tain, Wick,
and
all other places within the shire that occupied any freedoms, to come to
the aire of Inverness
;
And that himself saw the Sheriff make officers to escheat
all goods that were bought in the sheriffdom of Inverness that passed by the
burgh
; And that he saw the men of Dingwall and Tain put their goods iu the
ship
of Inverness, and pay the customs and duties there but
of tolerance of
Inverness,
(Aged 45 years.
John Clunes, in Cromarty, deponed that he saw the men of Dingwall buying
their goods, and put them in the ship of Inverness, and sail with them, and that
he wist never that Tain had any freedom but of licence of Inverness.
And that he
saw one called Donald Watson, in Dingwall, buy his freedom in Inverness, and
he was a child with him that time.
(60 years.)
William Dallas, of Cantray, deponed that he saw ever the burgh of Inverness
brook and enjoy all the freedom from Duncansbay to the West Sea, and heard

and that he heard say, that Earl Alexander of the
Isles required the Alderman
and bailies of Inverness to give their tolerance.
(50 years.)
William Dallas, of Budgate,
dej)oned that the burgh of Inverness was ever
the

it
is the head
staple of Caithness, Sutherland, Ross.

that he saw them come ever to the Justiceaire and Chamberlainaire to Inverness.
(Aged 60 years.)
Donald Noble deponed that he saw good men in Inverness and Dingwall, and
sailing together, but he heard never what freedom
they had, but dealt with

James Clerk deponed that he knows no freedom that Dingwall nor Tain has,
but deponed that he saw part of the men of Dingwall part ever to the burgh of
Inverness, and said it had been better to Dingwall and Tain to have holden use
and wont, aad claim nothing.
(Aged 60.)
Alexander Hossack deponed that

PART TENTH.
In the year 1508, Andrew, Bishop of Moray, confirmed
various foundations in favour of the altar of St Michael by
the deed after quoted, which, though lengthy, is interesting
in its full descriptions.
The benefactors were—William of
Bught, Alexander Waus, and Elizabeth Pylche, widow
o-f
William Pylche, Lord of Culcabock, the date of the grants
being
about
1455.
The
name
of
the
Lady
of
Castle
Hill in this document appears to be written Ellen Gouss.
The right of patronage
is conferred by William of Bught
upon the Council who have certain powers of administration
conferred upon them, but as they shall answer at the Great
Day.
The
offices
to
be performed are prescribed for
the
chaplains.
The
burn
called
Scourburn,
bordering upon
Broadstone, and described as running to the soidh, has now
no
existence.
Probably from the lands being
undrained,
water at this period settled on them, and the course may have
been towards the Millburn, by the road leading past Midmills
from the heights of the Crown and Broadstone.
Eeference is made, it will be observed, to a piece of land
termed of old the kail-yard.
It would appear that its culti-
vation, therefore, is of a pretty old date, though Dr Johnson
says he was told at Aberdeen " that the people learned from
Cromwell's soldiers to make shoes and to plant kail :'^-

this, I lay it on their consciences as they shall be
willing to answer in the day
of judgment in presence of the Judge of
all.
In testimony of which thing,
in

late William
Pilche, Lord of Culcabock, in her pure widowhood, in honour of St Michael, the

error, gave and granted two
acres of land lying in the " Schapflat," between her own land
at the west and
that of Ronald Clark at the

Upon the 23th of December 1508, John Dingwall, notary,
takes the following instrument and infeftment in favour of
John Auchlek, as chaplain of St Catherine's, Inverness, upon
the presentation of the Alderman,
Bailies, and Council of
Inverness
:
In the name of God, Am.en, by this present public instrument be it evidently
clear and made known to
all, that in the year of the incarnation of the Lord
1508, on the 28th day of the month of December, in the 12th indiction, and in
the 6th year of the pontificate of the most holy father in Christ and our Lord,
Lord Julius 2d, by divine providence, Pope, in presence of me, notary public,
and of the within-written witnesses, the honourable men, John Auchlek, alder-
man of the burgh of Inverness, the bailies, and common Council thereof for the
time being, personally constituted, with unanimous consent and assent, for the
perpetual
chai^laincy of the
blessed
virgin, Katherine, founded in the parish
church of Inverness, belonging to the presentation of said alderman, bailies, and
Council as they
assert, and of
full right to the ordinary collation of the Lord
Bishop
of
Moray, vacant by the resignation, demission, or renunciation of the
discreet man Sir Thomas Moray, last chaplain and possessor thereof, or about to
become vacant in a short time on the said Sir Thomas' own motion, presented
the discreet man
Sir John Auchlek, chaplain of said diocese of Moray,
to
the
reverend father in Christ and our Lord, Lord Andrew, bishop of Moray, and
commendator of Pittenweem and Coltinghame (Coldinghame ?)
in England, and
granted
it to him with the intention of neither changing, nor
in the form
of
increasing things used and wont
:
And the said John in foresaid church,
is and
shall be bound to do faithfully for the increase of divine worshij) in tlie said
parish church and choir thereof, and
also at the altar of the blessed virgin Ka-
therine foresaid,
in
singing and celebrating
of things divine, according as his
predecessors at said altar and the other chaplains of foresaid church and choir
of Inverness in times past have done,
or are now doing, and to perform, and
praise, and observe the usual divine duties
:
Also, he has bound and obliges

after the
strictest form of
obligation, by pledging
his honour
after
having touched the holy gospel of God corporally with his hands that no prejudice,
loss, or injury shall happen to any one contrary to the premises, or any of them
bj"- word or deed, by whatsoever means, or adverse to said parish church, choir,
and altar, and the liberty and government of said burgh and community thereof
:
Upon all and sundry which things, the said alderman, bailies, and Council on
the one part, and the foresaid Lord John on the other, demanded one or more
public instruments to be made for them by me, notary public under-written
:
These things were done in the choir of the Preaching Friars of Inverness, the
12th hour, midday, or thereabouts, in the year, month, day, indiction, and ponti-
ficate
as

:
There
being

the
discreet
men,
James
Donaldson,
Thomas Patrickson, John Cuthbert of the Old Castle, John Waus, Henry Ker,
and John Ker, burgesses of said burgh of Inverness, with divers other witnesses
to the premises called and also required.
And
I, John Dingwall,
^Driest of the diocese
of Moray, by holy
apostolic,
imperial, and royal
authority, notary public, foreasmu.ch as
I, along with the
forenamed witnesses, was present at the premises all and sundry, while thus
they were acted, said and done, and saw, knew, heard, and took note that they
all and sundry were thus done
;
I,
therefore, have made therefrom this pre-
sent public instrument, faithfully written with my own hand, and have reduced
it into this public form, and have signed
it with my usual and wonted
sign,
name, and
subscription, being
called on and requested so to do, for faith and
testimony of the truth of all and sundry the things premised.
The following instrument of protest at the
instance of
certain trades within the Lordship of Ardmannoch, hindered
by the Bailie of the Lordship from
crossing Kessock Ferry
with their goods to the Fair of the Holy Cross of Inverness,
is interesting.
It is dated 13th September 1509.
The
fair
of the Holy Cross or Roodmass was held on 3d May
:
In the name of God, Amen, by this present public instrument be
it clearly
known to all that in the year of the incarnation of the Lord, 1509, on the 13th
day of the month of September, in the 12th indiction, and in the sixth year of the

II., by
divine providence, Pope
: In presence of me, notary public, and of the witnesses
underwritten, John Waus, one of the bailies of the burgh of Inverness, personally
constituted together with me, notaiy public, and the witnesses underwi-itten,
went to the town of Kessock in Ardmannach, near the harbour or ferry thereof,
to
certain merchants there personally
assembled with
their
merchandise
or
wares,
in the cause
of the market of the foresaid burgh of Inverness, and en-
quired the cause of their coining, and they replied that they had come there with
their goods in the interest of the market of the Holy Cross of said burgh ot Inver-
ness, and that they were hindered by Henry Stewart, bailie of the reverend father
in Christ, Andrew, Bishop of Caithness, and chamberlain of our supreme lord
the King,
for Ross and Ardmannach, of whose reason they were truly entirely
ignorant, the said John, along with me, notary public, and the witnesses under-
written, came to the presence of the said Henry, the
bailie, there present, and
asked of him why and by what power he hindered the merchants and their goods
and others from coming to the burgh of our supreme lord the King
of
Inver-
ness, in the interest of the market thereof, and did not, according as was just,
admit them to the market of our said supreme Lord
:
And, moreover, the said
Bailie of Inverness offered to the said Henry, bailie of Ross and Ardmannach,
sufficient pledges for due payment to be made to him for said merchants and
others, whatsoever, who come to said market of whatsoever dues,
it is held they
are liable in, if any
:
The said Henry, bailie of Ross and Ardmannach, publicly
acknowledged that he prevented the foresaid merchants and their wares from
said market and burgh of Inverness, and he also refused wholly and
entirely
said
Bailie to
receive them and their goods
to
pledge.
From
all and sundry
which the said
Bailie
of Inverness solemnly appealed to the assistance of law
:
Of and on
all and sundry which the said
Bailie
of Inverness demanded
of me
notary pviblic underwritten public instruments, one or more to be made for him
:
These things were done at the harbour or ferry, near Kessock, in Ardmannach,
at the seventh hour after mid-day or thereabouts, the year, month, day, indiction,
and
pontificate,
as
above.
Present there— John

Avith divers other
witnesses
to the
premises, called and required.

they were acted, said, and done, and saw, knew, and heard, and took note that

JAMES IV.
1488 1513. PART TWELFTH AND LAST.
Upon the 9tli September 1513, the King, together with
many of the nobles and prominent men of Scotland, fell at
Flodden, a disaster
which, but
for the
King's
fatal pro-
crastination and obstinacy, should not have occurred.
Before concluding
this
reign, several matters connected
with Inverness which then happened are here noted.
The Earldom of Moray was granted in 1501 by James to
his natural son, James Stuart, commonly called the Earl of
Moray.
Upon his death, in 1544,
it reverted to the Crown,
and four years afterwards was
conferred on George, Earl of
Huntly.
In 1544
it was taken from Huntly, and
finally
granted by Queen Mary
in
1562
to
her
ungrateful
ille-
gitimate
brother,
the
Eegent.
It
is
said
that
Castle
Stuart, in Petty, but on doubtful authority, was a favourite
residence of King James IV., and originally designed
for a
Royal hunting seat.
It has also been stated, but erroneously,

is issued
to

as Mackintosh and Lochiel, are not designed by their proper
surnames.

JAMES V.
1513 1542.
PART FIRST.
In the latter year of James the Fourth's reign, the High-
lands and Isles had been comparatively quiet, but the feuds
and
divisions
among the great
nobles consequent on the
minority
of
the new
King,
spread
to
the
north.
The
intrigues of the family of Huntly, and the feuds of various
branches of the Macdonalds and of other
clans, kept
the
north
in
a
state
of
perpetual
disquietude,
resulting
in
ultimate
loss
to themselves.
The Argyle family now be-
came prominently mixed up in
all western
troubles, from
which they issued unharmed.
A commission under the quarter
seal
to William, Lord
Ruthven, and others, as
Sheriffs of Inverness, for executing
a
brief of idiotry and
the
cognoscing
of John,
Earl
of
Sutherland, is issued of date 3d May 1514.
These contemplated proceedings were interrupted by the
Earl's death, and his sister Elizabetli having succeeded, the
old surname sunk on her marriage with the Earl of Huntly's
second son.
Brieves having been issued, dated 17th September 1514,
Lady Elizabeth was served
heir in
special to the Earldom
of Sutherland and to her brother at Inverness upon the 3d
day of October 1514.
Among those on the inquest were
Thomas
Eraser, Lord Lovat, George Haliburton of Gask,
James Fenton of Ogle, James Dunbar of Cumnock, Alex-
ander Gumming of Altyre, James Gumming of Earnside,
Alexander
Urquhart
of
Burdsyards,
David
Dunbar
of
Durris, Alexander Brodie of that
Ilk, David
Douglas
of
Pittendriech, Hugh Rose of
Kilravock, Henry
Dallas
of
Cantray, William Dallas of Budgate, Alexander Strachan
of Gulloden, John Gorbet of Alford, John Vans
of Loch-
slyne, William Macculloch of Plaids, and Thomas Paterson,
burgess of Inverness.
Upon the 14th November 1514, Muriel Burrek grants the
following
charter
of a
peck
of land on
the
east
side of
Doomsdale Street in favour of Henry Simon's
son, burgess
of Inverness
:
To all wlio shall see or hear of this charter, Muriel Burrek ; Greeting iu the
Lord
: Know that I have sold and alienated from me, my
heirs, and assignees,
to my beloved Henry Symondson, burgess of
Inverness, one iieck of my land

far off, belonging to said land, with the pertinents, or which can justly in future
in any way belong,

without any revocation,
reclamation,
or
contradiction whatsoever to be made
by me, my heirs, and assignees or others, or on our part in time to come
: Giving
therefor annually, the said Henry, his heirs, and assignees,
to our supreme lord
the King one penny, and to Thomas Donaldson, burgess
of Inverness, and his
heirs, nine pence annually, and that in lieu of every other burden and secular

or required
for

his heirs, and

And
I, Thomas Finlay,

said Henry, that peck of land of mine lying in breadth within the land of the
said Finlay Bayne towards the south, and the land of Henry Talzeour towards
the
north, and

and

of the month of November, A.D. 1514, along with the seal of William Reed, one
of the
bailies present at the sealing of these presents, John Cuthbert, artisan,
James Dempster, and Alexander Anderson, and Patrick Brabiner, messenger,
with divers others.
In 1515 the Earl of Huntly was Sheriff of Inverness, and
by the month of June of that year the Countess of Suther-
land had married his son, Adam Gordon of Aboyne.
In the same year William Mackintosh of Mackintosh was
murdered in the town of
Inverness, and
the circumstances
are thus detailed
in
the MS.
History
:
" On
the 20th of
May 1515,
as he was asleep in his house in Inverness, he
was barbarously assassinated by John Roy Maclachlan-vic-
Allan, his own near
cousin.
The
assassin with his accom-
plices
eloped, but coukl not long escape divine vengeance.
Lachlan,
the brother of
William,
sent
Dougal
MacGili-
challum with twenty men
in pursuit of them
; who
traced
them through
Ross, Caithness, Strathnaver, Assynt, Loch-
alsh,
Abertarff,
Strathspey,
Strathdee,
and
to
Glenesk,
where they were (13 in number) all killed and
their
heads
brought to Moy, and set up in several places, a.d. 1516."
At Inverness, on the 19th March 1516, Andrew Low, son
and
heir of the
late Lawrence Faber, sells to the prudent
man, Henry Symondson, burgess of the burgh of Inverness,
a piece of land lying within tke burgh of Inverness, and on
the east side of the Doomsdalc Street, which
piece
lies be-
tween the land of Finlay Bane at the south, on the one side,
and the land of Eugenius Faber at the north, on the other,

required.
The annexed is probably the oldest lease extant connected
with property in
the town.
The merchants of the present
day, with their spacious and hands :)me
shops, may be
sur-
prised to hear that three centuries ago a space ten feet long
and two and a-half deep was thought worthy of being set ou
a formal lease.
The paper is marked on the back,

It would appear that the burgh possessed a " cuck-stool,"
the use of which is explained in the following extract
:—"A
woman indicted
for being a common
scold,
if
convicted,
shall be placed in a certain engine of correction, called
the
* trebucket,'
* castigatory,'
or
^cucking-stool";
which,
in
the Saxon
language, signifies
the
^ scolding-stool
;' though
now
it
is
frequently corrupted
into
the
' ducking-stooF
;
because the residue
of the judgment
is, that when
she
is
placed
therein,
she
shall

The whole
ecclesiastical staff at Inverness either did not
know what their precise duties were, or more probably ne-
glected them, and were in consequence, from the vicar down
to the parish clerk, cited before the Bishop of Moray, at the
instance of the Provost and
Bailies of Inverness, as repre-
senting the community.
The Bishop's decision, which prescribes the various offices
and duties is now given.
It will be observed that for breach
of the orders, fines are to be imposed, and
if there
should
occur a contumacious absence of three months, deprivation
of office might follow.
The deed
is very interesting, and
contains the names of all the ecclesiastics with their offices.
It is dated 22d August 1523:—
John, by divine mercy, Bishop of Moray, to all and sundry to whose knowledge
the present letters shall come
; Greeting, in the Saviour of all
: Know that on
the day of the date of these presents there compeared before us the honest and
discreet men, the lords and masters, James Hepburn,

Inverness
;
William Bawdoun, curate
thereof ; Magnus Wans, parish clerk of said church and chaplain of St Peter,
in the same, for himself, and as procurator of Lord Hugh Waus,
his brother
chaplain of the

; Andrew Cutberd, by a pro-
curator
;
John Auchinlek and John Scott, chaplains of the altars of the blessed
Virgin Mary, St John,
and
St Catherine the Virgin, founded in said church,
being lawfully cited by our letters of citation on the one part ; and the Provost
and bailies of the aforesaid burgh of Inverness, in their own name and on behalf
of the community, on the other, with respect to the service and manner of the
oflBces of divine worship—viz., vespers and other hours in said church, and the
form of attendance at service, and ministration of said curate,
clerk, and chap-
lains:

it
is duly incumbent, by virtue of our pastoral ofBce, to bring about as
much as we are able the increase
of
divine worship, to lead the good, reprove
the slothful, and to unite iu love aud peace those who disagree, having heard the
allegations and replies
of both the above said parties, and having the merits of
the case before us, with the intention and purpose as above, with the express
consent and assent of saids Provost, bailies, and community, and of the vicar,
curate, clerk, and chaplains, by the advice and counsel of the canons, worshipful
men, and men skilled in the law,
for the time assisting and advising us, we
have made, decerned, and ordained, and by our ordinary authority make, decern,
and by the tenor of these presents conform the underwritten foundation, ser-
vice, and attendance to endure in times to come in said Parish Church of Inver-
ness

the vigils of the saints, and to minister and perform the other duties which are
incumbent upon a vicar or curate to
exercise, together with the duties of the

of
said
church,
according
to
the
praiseworthy custom
of
our
diocese
hitherto observed in said church, and the parish
clerk, who for the time
shall
be,
is to be
similarly engaged in
said
offices,
vespers, and
holy processions,
there
to minister and chant,
reside in said church, and to perform the
other
duties annexed and pertaining to his office, according to the praiseworthy customs
of said church, and they shall be bound each and all strictly, as we by our ordi-
nary authority bind them to the i^remises, and with their consent in times to

successors
:
Moreover,

and his successors, to reside personally in their chaplainaries in foresaid church
by reason thereof, to worship and serve

dress, and there to chant and
serve, and to perform the duty in
turn of sub-chanter, to wear mantles, and adorn the divine worship according as
seems
fit, as we by our ordinary authority and with their consent,
assent, and
desire, and that of the said provost,
bailies, and community of the burgh, bind
them
to the premises in name
of
their chaplainaries
:
Also, by like decree,
we have appointed and ordained, in order to the more strict observance of said
foundation, for the punishment of said curate, clerk, vicar, and chaplains, if they
are away, or absent themselves from, said divine duties as foresaid, that whoever
is absent
shall
be bound
for
his absence on Sundays, and festivals, to make

ecclesiastical
censure,

of and distribute
these towards pious
uses, and

the counsel and advice of

:
If,
moreover, it shall happen that said parish clerk or the chaplains founded and so
fixed to residence as is premised or any of them be absent without just leave for
the space of three months from

King James granted the following Charter of Confirma-
tion to the Friars of Inverness of the previous Charters al-
ready quoted of their respective dates, by Alexander II. and
Robert the Bruce.
In the
narrative, it will be observed,
that from length of time and negligent preservation, these
Charters appeared wasted and partly spoiled.
The Charter
is dated at Perth, on 31st August 1530, and is as follows:
James, by the grace of God, King of Scots,—To
all good men of his whole
land, Clergy and Laity ; Greeting : Know ye, for as much as we have examined
and considered two Charters, granted by our late most noble progenitors of happy
memory, Alexander, King of Scots, and Robert, King of Scots, to our devout
mendicant preaching Friars of our Burgh of Inverness, viz.
: The one Charter,
containing therein a grant of our Royal Highway, lying in length from the water
of Ness, as far as the lands granted to them by the Abbot and Convent of our
Monastery of Arbroath, and extending in breadth between the burying-ground
of the Parish Church of the said Burgh, and the walls of the place of the said
Friars, together with the Island lying on the north side of the said place, and on
the south side of the said water,* with the whole water and fishing thereof, from
the foresaid highway, as far as the Scurrie, in pure and perpetual charity ; and
the other Charter, containing therein a grant of ten pounds ot the money of our
kingdom, out of the customs of our said Burgh, to be paid annually to them, as
is more fully contained in the said Charters, to that
effect as under-written
;
and whereas, from length of time and negligent preservation, these Charters ap-
pear wasted and partly spoiled, whereof the tenors
follow, in these words :
*' Alexander, by the grace of God, King of Scots,—To all good men of his whole
realm ; Greeting
: Know ye, that we have given, granted, and by this our pre-
sent Charter, confirmed to our endowed chaplains, the preaching Friars of

the Parish Church and the wall of the said Friars, and that Island of
our land lying on the north side of the said Friars, on the south side of the water
of Ness, with the whole water and fishing from the foresaid Friars' Road, as far as
Scurry, in pure and perpetual charity, with all commodities, liberties, and ease-
ments, to be enjoyed freely, quietly,

underly the law at the next Justice-aire, for art and part of
the oppression done to Mr Gawin Dunbar, Treasurer of Ross,
coming upon him, in company with Robert, Bishop of Ross,
and his accomplices, in the Cathedral Church of Ross, and
laying hands upon him, and
cruelly wounding him, to the

In the name of God, Amen, by this present public instrument he it evidently
patent and known to

on the 13th day of the month of May, the second indiction, and in the 10th year
of the pontificate of the most Holy Father in Christ, and our lord, by divine pro-

co-notaries, and of
the under-written witnesses, the Keverend Father in Christ and Lord, Patrick,
by divine mercy, Bishop of Moray, and the honourable and distinguished men,
masters and lords, William Paterson, Alexander Sutherland, John Lokart, and
Thomas Wallace, canons of the Cathedral Church of Moray, and subdean and
prebendaries of Duff us, Innerkethny, and Unthank, personally constituted, came
to the house of relics of said Cathedral Church of Moray, in which is preserved
the Seal of the Chapter, and there, neither led by force or fear, nor having fallen
into error, but of their own free
will agreed, took part
in, and ordered to be
sealed with the Seal of their Chapter, a certain charter and precept of sasine of
the said Keverend Father, to the noble and potent Lord, Hugh Fraser, Lord of
Lovat, of and regarding the church lands of Easter Kiumylies, Wester Kinmy-
lies, Ballifeary, Easter Abriachan, Wester Abriachan, the Mill of Bught, Kilqu-

fully contained.
Upon which, all and sundry, the discreet man, Lord Andrew
Dow, procurator, in name of the said noble Lord Hugh, Lord of Lovat, sought from
us, CO notaries under-written, one or more public instruments to be made for him.
These things were done in the said house of
relics, about 12 A.M.,
year, day,
month, indiction, and pontificate as
above.
Present there, Lords James Doug-
las, Thomas Hay, and John
Gibson,
priests and notaries-public, and George
Kirk, with divers other witnesses

called

And I, William Wiseman, priest of the diocese of Moray, notary-public, by holy
Aijostolic authority, forasmuch as
I, along with the witnesses foreuamed, was
present at the signing of said charter and precept
of sasine, and at the other
things, all and sundry, while thus,
as
is premised, they were acted, said, and
done, and saw, knew, and heard, and took note that they,
all and sundry, were
thus done
;
I, therefore, have made therefrom, together with the subscribed co-
notary, this present public instrument,
faithfully written with my own hand,
and have reduced it into this public form of instrument, and have signed it with
my accustomed and usual sign, name, and cognomen, being called on and requested
so to do for faith and testimony of all and sundry the premises.

sent

Master Alexander Sutherland, Dean
of Caithness,
canon and official of Moray
: Greeting, in him
in whom
is the salvation of all
;
Know that we have received with becoming reverence the letters of the Keverend
Father in Christ and Lord, Marcus
Germanus, by divine mercy, Patriarch of
Aquileia, legate de latere, with power of our most holy lord the Pope, and of his
apostolic seat,
legate to the whole Kingdom of Scotland, under his round seal
and manual subscription, written on parchment, genuine, complete, not erased
nor worn
out,
but free from every flaw and supposition, presented to us by our
beloved James Grant of Culcabock, and Master Hugh Cragy, procurator of Agnes
Fraser, wife of the said James, of the diocese of Moray, by command of said Prince,

to the effect underwritten, as appeared lawful to us, they being the principals
principally mentioned in the document
in these
letters, of which the tenor fol-
lows
: Marcus Germanns, by divine mercy, Patriarch of Aquileia, with the power
of legate de latere of our most holy lord, Paul, Third Pope, and of the apostolic
see, legate to the whole Kingdom of Scotland, to the Reverend Father in Christ,
the Bishop of Moray,
or to his vicar or official general in spiritualibus, Eternal
Greeting in the Lord
: On the part of onr beloved in Christ, John Grant, layman,
and Agnes Fraser, his wife, of your diocese, a petition brought to us contained,
that they for certain reasonable causes,
desired to marry, but as they were con-
nected together in the fifth degree of
affinity, they were prevented, and being
aware of this impediment, they frequently knew one another carnally, and are
not able to implement their desire in that respect without obtaining an apostolic
dispensation therefor
: Wherefore, the said petitioners have humbly entreated us
that they be graciously i^rovided duly, with the favour of an absolution and op-
portunity, with the benefit of a dispensation for these things by the apostolic
see
: We, accordingly,
willing to provide for the salvation of the souls of said
petitioners in this matter, and being moved by their humble supplications, com-
mit to you, by the Ai)ostolic authority granted to us, and which we employ in
this matter with circumspection, that if it is so, ye absolve said petitioners from
the crime of incest and excesses of that kind, and thereafter enjoin to each of
them, by way of punishment, a salutary i3enance and others which by law are in
use to be enjoined
: Then that ye mercifully give dispensation to the said peti-
tioners, that notwithstanding the impediment of the said fifth degree of affinity,
they may freely contract marriage together and solemnize that, in the face of the
Church, and after it has been contracted, therein lawfully to continue, provided
that the
said woman,
on that account,
shall not be carried away by any one,
decreeing that the children begotten, if there be any, and those that may hereafter
be begotten, be legitimate.
Given at Edinburgh, in the diocese of St Andrews,
in the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 1544, the 9fch April, and the 10th year
of the Pontificate of our foresaid lord the Pope.
Ita, siib^cribitur, on the front
page, M. Patriarcha legatus, and at the foot, M. A.
Tidaldimus, and on the
fold, M. de Montemerlo.
After presentation, reception, and reading of which
Apostolic letters of the foresaid Lord Legate by the said John Grant, personally
present, and by the said Master Hugh,
procurator of said Agnes, in her name,
the principals in said letters principally named, we duly, with requisite instance,
thought fit to proceed to the execution of said Apostolic letters of dispensation
regarding the
fifth degree of affinity between the said John Grant and Agnes,
according to the tenor of said letters
: We, therefore, willing, as we are bound, to
obey the Apostolic mandate in all things, and considering the petition of said par-
ties just and reasonable, find from the depositions of certain witnesses produced,
sworn and examined before us, that all and sundry in said Apostolic letters were
and are true, and that the said John and Agnes are connected together and re-
lated in the fifth degree of affinity, and that knowing this impediment they fre-
quently knew one another carnally, according as is contained in said letters, and
that the said Agnes, on account of the present dispensation would now be car-
ried off
: Wherefore, we have absolved the said John and Agnes from the crime
of incest foresaid, and other excesses, and enjoined upon them a salutary penance
for the crimes, and mercifully have dispensed, as by the tenor of these presents,
we dispense to the said John,
personally i)resent, and to Agnes,
in the person
of
said
Master Hugh, her procurator,
that notwithstanding the impediment
of the fifth degree of affinity, they may freely contract and solemnize said mar-
riage betwixt them in face of the Church, decreeing the children born, or to be
born, legitimate
:
In faith and testimony of
all and sundry the premises, we
have ordered, and caused the present
letters,
or this present public instrument
to be made thereon and written by the underwritten notary public, to be corrobo-
rated by the appending of our official seal of Moray.
These things were given and
acted in the Consistory of Moray, the last day of the month of April, and in the
second indiction, in the tenth year of the pontificate of the Most Holy Father in
Christ and our Lord, Lord Paul, by divine providence. Pope Third, at the hour of
10 A.M. or thereabouts.

The
following
singular and
interesting
statute, by the
i
!rrovost, Magistrates, and Town Council of Inverness,
re-
ceived royal confirmation through the Earl o± Arran,
pro-
tector and governor of the kingdom.
It is directed against
outlandish men of great
clans, who had, with other mis-
deeds, by
divers
and
sundry
sinister ways
obtained
in-
fluence over widows of deceased burgesses, and who, while
unfit to trade, had still entered into and possessed many of
the common tacks
and steadings of the burgh,
spending
the
profits
outwith
the
same.
This
curious
document,
which has been most fortunately preserved
in the town's
archives, is dated 19th March 1545, and is as follows
:

Nichol Ker, James Merchant,
and William Gumming,
burgesses
of the said burgh, and the remanent of the
Council and community of the said burgh, gathered and congregated in the Tol-
booth of the said burgh of Inverness,
for sundry matters and business concern-
ing our common weal, and in special touching the great hurt and skaith which
have been this long time bygone used through indrawing of outlandish men of
great clans not able nor qualified to use merchandice, nor make daily residence,
nor policy, nor any manner of bigging within the said burgh, but allenarly to
brook and possess the profit of the common tacks and steadings of the said burgh,
and the profits thereof to be spent and used outwith the said burgh at their
pleasure, contrary to the statutes and acts of burghs, nor any good cause done
for the weal of the said burgh for the said tacks and steadings ; which outlandish
men and great clans have by divers and sundry sinister ways purchased their
freedoms through solicitation and labours of great clanned men, and others ad-
jacent to the said burgh, by reason that the widows within the said burgh have
brooked and possessed the common tacks and steadings of the same, after the
decease of their husbands, wherethrough the saids tacks and steadings, are pos-
sessed and brooked by outlandish men of great clans by reason of their interest
with the said widows, wherethrough the neighbours, children, and native-men
of the said burgh who were, and are able to use merchandice, policy, and other
virtues concerning the weal
of the said burgh,
are put from
the tacks, and
steadings, and native rowmes thereof, through the which they must of necessity
and of main force pass to other parts to dwell, wherethrough all virtue and mer-
chandice within the said burgh are abused, ceased, and decayed, nor the
said
burgh
able to
serve our Sovereign Lady, nor her
lieges,
at times necessary
:
Herefor, and for sundry other
reasonable
cavises
and
considerations moving
us, we, the saids Provost, Bailies, Council, with the advice of the foresaid com-
munity,
Statute, Decern, and Ordain that no widow shall have, nor brook any
tacks nor steadings in time coming within the said burgh, burrowage, and liberty
thereof, of the old manner, by reason of the decease of their husbands, but the
same to be brooked, enjoyed, occupied and possessed in
all times coming by the
heirs male lawfully gotten, or to be gotten, by the neighbours' own bodies, posses-
sors of the saids tacks and steadings instantly, and no others' heirs male, and
never
in time coming to be brooked, used, nor possessed by any widow of the
old manner, by reason of their husband's decease
; Providing always that the
heirs male of the saids neighbours gotten, or to be gotten, of their own bodies,
be thought qualified by the Provost and Bailies and their Council for the time, to

the Provost, Bailies, and Council, with them for the timo, shall dispone the same
to other neighbours worthy and qualified therefor, as they think cause, for the
weal of the said burgh

And if any of the saids neighbours' heirs male, gotten,
or to be gotten, as said
is, happens
to be young at the time of the decease
of
tlieir fathers, or others to whom they ought to succeed,
then, and in that case,
the nearest of the father's kin being (a) free man and indweller within the said
bjirgh, be thought worthy,
qualified, and responsible by the saids neighbours,
shall intromit with his tacks and steadings, being within age unto the time the
pupil and child be of perfect and lawful age, and shall make count of the profit
thereof once in the year to the saids Provost, Bailies, and Council for the time,
that it may be known by them that the said
profit be put to the utility of the
said pupil and child, and decoration and policy of the said burgh
: In witness of
the which thing to this our statute,

1542-1567. PART FOURTH.
Following out the
evil schemes of the family of Huntly
to ruin the Mackintoshes, Alexander, Lord Gordon, obtained
a royal precept,
directing the Bishop of Moray
to receive
him as vassal in room of William Mackintosh of Dunachton
in the Barony of Moy and
others, which precept is dated at
Inverness, 8th August 1552, and passed the great seal.
At Inverness, on the 23d August 1552, George, Earl of
Huntly, prolocutor
for John Rose, brother
to the laird of
Kilravock, asked acts and instruments that Margaret Vans
confessed and declared, in presence of Sir John Campbell of
Lundy, Knight, justice-depute,
etc., that she passed of her
own free will, with the said John and his accomplices, furth
of this burgh of Inverness, and was not ravished by them
against her win.
The instrument
is thus subscribed: "It
is so
; James Myller,
notary, and one of the
scribes in the
justiciary office, for the time."
At Inverness, on the 24th August 1552, there was granted
" Commission nnder
the
great
seal, by
Mary,
Queen
of
Scots, with advice of James, Duke of Chatelherault, Earl of
Arran, Lord Hamilton, Protector and Governor of the King-
dom,
to Archibald,
Earl of Argyle, Lord
Campbell and
Lome, and Justice-General of Scotland.
This Commission
narrates,
that notwithstanding the
said Governor has re-
mained
for a long time dispensing
justice in the burgh of
Inverness, the Clanranald nevertheless refused obedience to
Her Majesty's authority and laws, with the other subjects of
the kingdom ;
Wherefore Her Majesty gives full power to
the said Earl of Argyle to assemble his friends and vassals,
and with them to go to the Clanranald, and to pursue them
with fire and sword, and within
whatever islands they may
seek
refuge,
for
their
disobedience;
depredations,
and
murders."

John Grant
of Mulbayne
is
served
heir
to
his father
James Grant of Freuchie, in,
inter
alia, the lands of Urqu-
hart, with the castle thereof, at Inverness, in the year 1553.
Two years later, and in the month of July 1555, Mary of
Guise, Queen Regent, who had succeeded the Earl of Arran as
Protector, visited Inverness, and held a Convention of Estates,
and
Courts
for the
punishment of crimes.
Sir R.
Gor-
don
states
that the
Queen
Regent, marching northward,
came in July
to
Inverness, accompanied by the
Earls of
Huntly, Argyle, Athole, Marishall, the Bishop ofRoss and Ork-
ney, and sundry other noblemen, "where she held Justice-
aires,
with most extreme and
rigorous
punishment,
and
charged every one of the Captains of the Highlands to bring
in the offenders
of
their own kin, according to the order
prescribed
in King James the
Fifth's
time, under great
pains
; wherethrough many were entered, both of Mackenzie
kin, Balnagown, Lord Lovat, Mackintosh,
Laird of Grant,
and many others, whereof there were sundry executed
; and
among the rest, the Laird of Grant being charged
to bring
in a special friend of his own^
called James Grant, for his
oppression,
because
he
could
not
be
apprehended
and
brought quick (alive) to justice, he caused him and the rest
of his
company
to
be
slain, and
their heads
to
be
pre-
sented to the Queen Regent.
At the same time, the Earl
of Caithness was charged likewise for the like causes, and
was put in ward, first in Inverness, and next in the Castle
of Edinburgh, when he paid great sums
of money
ere he
was delivered.
Mackay, the same time Captain of Strath-
naver, by the assistance
of the Clan Gun, who had done
great injuries and wrongs to the country of (Sutherland, next
adjacent
to them, would not enter
;
therefore,
the Queen
caused the Earl of Sutherland convene a great army, and
pass within the country of Strathnaver ; and likewise sent
certain ships by sea, whereby he was
constrained to render
himself, and come with
Sir Hew Kennedy to
the Queen,
where he remained in ward in Edinburgh divers years there-
after
; and sundry pledges were received
for the Clan Gun,
who were kept in some strength
for their good rule during
the Queen Regent's pleasure."
" After the Queen had made her residence in Inverness,
and
visited
the
county
of
Ross,
she
returned
to Elgin,
Banff,
and Aberdeen,
where she held
aires likewise
; but
not with so great execution of men's bodies, but rather by
composition of money, &c."
It is related in the History of the Frasers, that " whilst
the Queen remained
at Inverness, Alexander, Lord Lovat,

paid his
respects
to
her,
attended by a numerous retinue
when she condoled with him on
the
loss of his father and
clan.
Both the Lady Lovat and
the Lady Dowager waited
upon Her Majesty at the same time
; and Lord Lovat,
at
the head of 200 chosen
followers, re-conveyed her
to
the
banks of the
Spey.
On bidding him
adieu,
she paid him
great commendations for his politeness and hospitality."
Alexander Sutherland, feudatory of the Chaplaincy of St
Mary of the
Green, within
the Burgh of Inverness, with
consent of Sir Thomas Sutherland, chaplain thereof, grants
an annual

Evil days now fell on the Prior and Convent of Inverness,
and upon the 23d June 1559,
they were obliged to deposit
their charters and gear, for
security, with the Provost and
Magistrates of Inverness.
Their buildings, no doubt, soon
became ruinous.
Nothing is known of the fate of the effects
handed over, which included " a little
relic of silver ;" but
there are records to show that the tenements, annual rents,
and other property of the
friars were
speedily divided or
leased out by the town authorities among themselves:

MARY.
1542-1567.
PART SIXTH.
The Queen visited Inverness
in
course of the year 1562,
and remained for some time, staying, according to universal
tradition, in the house
at the foot of Bridge
Street, known
as "The Wine Shop."
The foundations of this building may
even
be
older
than
the
period
of
the
Queen's
sojourn.
Various accounts
have appeared of the occurrences which
then took place.
It is therefore thought right to insert here
the account from the Mackintosh History, completed within
a hundred years after.
This has not been published, and is
thus new
:
Lachlan Mor
Mackintosh went to Edinburgh for his education about 1558,
and returned to live upon his estate in the year 1562, being then nineteen years
of age.
He was but a few months at home when Queen Mary came to Inverness,
in the month of September.
A little time before this, John Gordon of Findlater,
second son to the Earl
of Huntly, had mortally wounded James
Ogilvy. for
which the Queen ordered him to prison
; but he broke his confinement, and fol-
lowed the Queen to the north, with a view to cut off the Earl of Moray, and to
oblige the Queen to marry himself, though he was at that time married to ano-
ther woman.
The Earl of Huntly could never digest his being deprived of the
earldom of Moray, and having both the Queen and the Earl
of Moray in the
north, he thought it a proper time to cut off the one and to oblige the other to
marry his son, in which event his ambition would be fully gratified.
In order
to this he raised a considerable force, and finding that the Queen, on her way to
Inverness, would not touch at his house of Huntly, he
left her.
When she ar-
rived at
Inverness, she was denied access into the Castle, whereof Huntly was
constable, and she found that
it was garrisoned by Huntly's men.
Upon
this,
her former suspicions were heightened.
But next day her fears were dispelled
by the coming of the Clan Chattan, and after them the Erasers and Munroes, to
her aid.
The castle was then attacked
: the captain surrendered and was hanged,
the garrison were pardoned
; and on the Queen's return, upon the 28th October
the battle of Corrichie was fought, wherein Huntly was trodden to death under
foot, and his sons, John and Adam, made prisoners.
John was beheaded, and
Adam for his youth was pardoned.
From Randolph's communications
to
Cecil we learn
the
following in connection with Queen Mary's visit to Inverness:
" On 10th August 1562,"
he
writes,
^^ from
Stirling she
taketh her journey, as
far north
as
Inverness, the
farthest
part of Murray, a
terrible journey, both
for horse and man,



INVERNESSIANA.
229
the countries are so
poor, and the victuals
so scarce.
It
is
her will that I should attend upon her thither.
It is thought
that it will be a journey for her of two months and more."
On the lltli August she
started from Edinburgh on this
terrible
journey,
and
on
the 11th September
leaves
Dar-
nawaj, arriving that same evening in Inverness.
On the 18th September he writes from Spynie
:
At the Queen's
arrival
at
Inverness, she purposing
to have lodged in the
Castle, which pertaineth to herself, and the keeping only to the Earl of Huntly
[Lord Gordon] being Sheriff by inheritance, was refused there to have entry,
and enforced to lodge in the town.
That
night, the Castle being summoned
to be rendered to the Queen, answer was given by those that kept it, in Lord
Gordon's
behalf, that without his command
it should not be delivered.
The
next day the country assembled to the assistance of the Queen.
The Gordons,
also, made their friends come out.
"VVe looked every hour to what shall become
of the matter.
We left nothing undone that was needful.
And the Gordons,
not
fie ding themselves
so well
served,
and
never
amounting
to
above
five
hundred men, sent word to those that were within, amounting only to twelve or
thirteen
able men,
to render
the
Castle, which they did.
The captain was
hanged, and his head set upon the Castle
; some others condemned to perpetual
imprisonment
;
and the rest received mercy.
In
all those
garbulles, I assure
your honour
I never saw
the Queen merrier
;
never dismayed
;
nor, never
thought I, that stomach to be in her, that I
find.
She repented nothing but,
when the lords and others at Inverness came in the morning from the watche,
that she was not a man, to know what life it was to lye all
night in the fields,
or to walk upon the causeway, with a jack and knapsack, a Glasgow buckler,
and a broadsword.
Lest your honour should speere [enquire] what in this mean-
time I did, it may please you to know that, in good
faith, when so many were
occupied, I was ashamed to sit still, and did as the rest.
At Inverness, on the 15th of October 1563, John Camp-
bell of Cawdor was
served
heir
in the Barony
of Strath-
nairn, before James, Earl of Moray, Sheriff- Principal.
On
the inquest were Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail, Alexander
Ross of Balnagown, Robert Munro
of Fowlis, Hugh Rose
of
Kilravock,
Alexander
Falconer
of Halkerton,
Robert
Dunbar of Durris, William Eraser of Struy, Y. Mackay of
Ear, Jasper Yaus of Lochslyne, Alexander Urquhart, sheriff
of Cromarty, Hugh Eraser of Guisachan, George Munro of
Davochcartie, and Alexander Chisholm of Comer.
William Sutherland, parson and exhorter
at the Church
of Moy,
for
misdoings,
fell
under
the
censure
of
the
General Assembly.
The Assembly on the 30th June 1564,
pronounced the following censure
:— " Eorasmuch as it was
complained by the Commissioner of Moray, upon William
Sutherland, parson and exhorter at the Kirk of Moy, that he
had not only disobeyed his charge commanding him to marry
the woman with whom he before had committed fornication,
but
also had, in despite
of the
said Commissioner, ryvein
(torn
up)
his
letters
of
charges
thereto,
and
had
not
obeyed his summons charging him to compear to this General
Assembly
:
In consideration
of
this
despiteful ryveing
of
the Commissioner's letters, and also not compearing to this
Assembly, the Kirk deprives him of
all ecclesiastical func-

tion, and also ordains
the censurers of the Kirk to proceed
against him for his contempt."
The head of the Clan Gun was, by
tradition, executed at
Inverness, by
the
Kegent,
for
taking
'^ the crown of the
causeway."
In a rental of the Bishoprick of Moray, compiled in 1565,
the tenements
of Helen Fleming and Robert Waus, within
the burgh of Inverness, and possessed respectively by Peter
Winchester and Jasper Waus, are inserted
as each paying
one pound of pepper yearly.
At Edinburgh, 22d September A. D. 1565.—The King and Queen's
Majesties,
for certain occasions moving them, ordain an officer of arms to pass, and in their
Highnesses' name and authority, command and charge George Munro of Davoch-
carty, and Andrew Munro, his son, and all others, havers and vv^ithholders of the
Castle of Inverness, to deliver the same to Hugh Rose of Kilravock, whom their
Majesties have recommended
to
receive the same within
six hours next after
they be charged thereto, under the pain of treason.

Henry B.
The King and Queen,
four days
later, sent the following
letter to Kilravock
:
True Friend, we greet you well.
Seeing the defection of the Earl of Murray
so unnaturally against us, it is not convenient that any his houses or ours be re-
tained by him or any
in his name
;
and amongst the rest have we thought ex-
pedient to commit the keeping of our Castle of Inverness to you, having so good

Upon the 9th of October 1565,

order
:
Rex et Regina.
Captains and keepers of the Castle of
Inverness,—We charge you that, in
continent this present seen, ye deliver the Castle thereof to our true cousin and
counsellor, George, Earl of Huntly, and others having his commission thereto,
with
all
plenishing and
moveables received by
you,
taking
their
discharge
thereof ;
and this in no wise ye leave undone, as ye will answer to us under all
highest pain and charge
;
keeping this present for your warrant.

By the Treasurer's letter of 27th October,
it would appear
that Kilravock,
if he got possession of the
Castle
at
all,
must have given it up almost immediately
:
From the Lord Treasurer.
True Friend,—After hearty
commendation,
I have
received your writing,
whereas ye thereby have
signified how commission was received by you from
Master Thomas Ker, for receiving the place of Inverness, and that there is no
certain duty appointed to
be given unto you for keeping
thereof, and await-
ing in the charge committed to you, in that
behalf.
It pleased the King and
Queen's Majesties, and their
secret
council,
to commit th« charge thereof unto
you at the time of the making of the commission, and then no order was taken
to spend any expenses or duty therefor
:
Yet, because
I have understood
since
then that the said place is by you rendered again to such as had new commission
to receive it, and that ye continue not in keeping thereof, nor have not sustained
any expenses therethrough, ye
will not seek damage in that
case.
Always ye
may be assured if ye had continued and borne that charge, that the furtherance

which lay in me, in accomplishing the desire of your writing, should not have
been omitted.
This commits you to God.
At Edinbui-gh, the 27th of October
1505.—Yours assuredly,
Maister ROT, Kichardson, Thesur.
To his assured good friend the Baron of Kilravock, this be delivered.

MARY.
1542-1567. PART SEVENTH AND LAST.
From the process of reduction of the sentence of forfeiture
and treason pursued by the relict and children of the
late
George, Earl
of Huntly, in April 1567, the following ex-
tracts are taken with reference to the Earl's participation in
the events at Inverness at the time of the Queen's visit in
the autumn of 1562
:
The process of which reduction is sought was raised against the Earl of Huntly
and his followers, and doom of forfeiture pronounced, because of a conspiracy
entered into to seize the Queen's person on her northward progress.
The docu-
ment goes on to say,
" because the purposes desired at Aberdeen could not be
performed as then, they concluded to put violent hands on our said sovereign
and her counsellors and other her servants and assisters being with her for the
time, wherever opportunity might serve, and specially in the town of Inverness
;
and in devising of sundry wicked persons, men of arms, to convene and come to
the said burgh of Inverness
for performing of their said wicked intent, and in
the treasonable withholding of the Castle of Inverness, and in the treasonable
assistance given to the keepers thereof, against our said sovereign's command,
and for the treasonable besetting of her Highness' march in her passage from In-
verness to Craigaboyne, and for the treasonable assistance and counsel given
to
the said late John Gordon and the persons being in the fortalices and castles of
Findlater and Auchindown.
In the summons of which redu.ction is sought, the Earl and his followers are
charged with coming to Inverness in the night-time, upon the Friday after the
3d of SeiJtember 1562,
" when our said sovereign and her company were in the
town of Inverness, should have treasonably invaded and put hands on her per-
son, and
also on the persons
of the
lords
of
secret
covincil and
session, and
others
being
with
her Highness
for
the
time,
and to have
slain
or
other-
wise demeaned her and them,
as they
thought good,
and
also
in
devising
that the said lord and his said late
father should address them to the
castle of
Inverness,
with their
servants and
friends,
to
awaifc upon the
said
late Sir
John's (Sir John Gordon of Deskfurd) coming with his company, and
to espy
the places where our said sovereign, her said lords and company were lodged,
and to have been in readiness to fortify and
assist the performing of the said
enterprise, for amplifying and performing of the which the said Earl, upon the
said Friday, the 11th day of September foresaid, came
to Turodown with 160
horsemen, and there tarried all night, upon the coming of his said brother send-
ing in sundry parts
spies to the said town of Inverness to perceive and espy
what our said sovereign and her said lords were doing.
And so did all that was
in him to i^erform the said wicked enterprise, did not the purpose fail upon the
part of the said Sir John and his
folk, and in the treasonable commanding, al-
lowing, and ratifying of the treasonable holding and furnishing of the house and
fortalice of Inverness against the Queen's Majesty, the same pertaining to her,
the said Earl being only keeper thereof in her name,
after that his servants
being therein, for whom he
is obliged to answer, were divers times charged to
have delivered the said house and
fortalice, and to have made the same patent
to her Highness to have lodged therein, and after charge given to that effect by
Williara Bryson, messenger at command of her letters after sound of trumpet."

INVERNESSIANA.
Shortly
before the unfortunate Qaeen was dethroned she
granted
the
following
Charter
to
the
town
of Inverness.
It is full and interesting, and shows how thorough and com-
plete had been the change.
James VT. was proclaimed King
on 29 th July 1567, his mother being
still but twenty- three
years
old
:
Mary, by the grace of God Queen
of Scots, To
all. good men of her whole
kingdom, cleric and
laic
;
Greeting
: Know that we, carefully considering our
duty toward the
service of God, and because of the ardent zeal which we have
for the upholding of the State, and for the preservation of due order among our
subjects, and chiefly within our burgh of Inverness
; considering, therefore, that
we, by our
office, are bound, and ought to consider our duty toward God, by
whose providence we are placed in the government of this kingdom, and also
that it is by our office incumbent upon us to provide by every honest means tor
the
ministers
of the Word
of God, and that hospitals should be
maintained
within our said burgh for poor, mutilated, and wretched, for orphans and child-
ren without parents
; we, after our perfect age, with advice of the Lords of our
Secret Council, have given, granted, disponed, and for us and our successors for
ever confirmed, and also by the tenor of these presents we gave, granted, dis-
poned, and for us and our successors for ever confirmed to our beloved, the Pro-
vost, bailies, council, and community of our said burgh of Inverness and their
successors
for
ever,
all and sundry the
lands, tenements,
houses,
buildings,
churches, chapels, orchards, gardens, acres,
crofts, annual
rents, fruits, duties,
profits, emoluments, rents,
alms, obits, and anniversaries whatsomever, which
in any way pertained or are known to pertain to whatsoever chaplaincies, vicar-
ages,
altarages,
and
prebendaries,
in
whatsoever church,
chapel,
or
college
within the liberty, privilege, and parish of our said burgh of Inverness, founded
by whatsoever patron, in the possession whereof the chaplains, vicars, and pre-
bendaries thereof had been formerly, wherever the foresaid houses, tenements,
buildings, orchards,
gardens,
acres,
crofts, annual rents,
anniversaries,
fruits,
profits, and emoluments
lie or were formerly levied respectively, with manor-
places, gardens, acres, lands, annual rents, emoluments, duties, mills, and
fish-
ings which formerly pertained to the Dominican or Preaching Friars of our said
burgh, together with all and sundry lands, houses, tenements, lying within our
said burgh, privilege and pai'ish tliereof, with all annual rents of whatsoever house,
lands, or tenement, within our said burgh, given, donated, and founded to what-
soever chaplaincies, altarages, churches, mortuaries, and anniversaries whereso-
ever they are within our kingdom
; and also with all and sundry annual rents and
other duties paid to, or which could be demanded by whatever church without our
said burgh from the Provost or bailies of the common rent of the same, for cele-
brating orisons, with the pertinents
: To be held and had all and sundry the fore-
said lands, tenements, houses, buildings, gardens, orchards, acres, crofts, annual
rents,
fruits,
duties,
profits,
emoluments,
rents,
alms,
obits,
anniversaries,
churches, chapels, the abodes of the Friars, gardens, milns, and fishings thereof,
with their pertinents, by the foresaid Provost, bailies, council, and community,
and their successors, of us and our successors for ever, according as they
lie in
length and breadth in houses, buildings, walls, materials, wood, stone and lime,
with free ish and entry, and with all and sundry liberties, commodities, profits,
easements, and their just pertinents whatsoever, as well not named as named,
both under and above ground, belonging, or which can in any way in
future
justly belong to foresaid lands, tenements, houses, buildings, gardens, orchards,
acres, crofts, annual rents, fruits, duties, mills, fishings, emoluments, and others
above-written, with the
pertinents, freely,
quietly, fully, wholly, honourably,
well, and in peace, without revocation or contradiction whatsoever
; with power
to the foresaid Provost, bailies, council, and community, and their successors by
themselves or their collectors whom they appoint, of levying and receiving fore-
said annual rents, fruits, and duties whatsoever, wherever they had been
for-
merly levied, of setting and removing foresaid lands and tenements, of building
up and repairing broken-down places, and of converting and applying the same
into hospitals or other similar lawful uses, according as to them, with the ad-
vice of the ministers and elders of the said burgh, shall seem exi^edient, as fully
in all as the foresaid prebendaries, chaf)lains, vicars, or friars above-written, could
have formerly been able to enjoy and possess the same
: And the foresaid Pro-
vost, bailies, council, and their successors shall be bound and obliged to main-
tain ministers, readers, and other ecclesiastical burdens, with the foresaid annual

233
rents, profits, and duties, in proportion to their value and quantity, and to apply
the places and buildings repaired to hospitality and others before-written
; and
also, considering with what great fraud a great number of said prebendaries,
chaplains, vicars, aiad
friars
before-wi'itten, who, after
tlie change
of religion,
disi^oned, alienated, and gifted away into the hands of certain particular men,
their lands, annual
rents, and tenements, formerly mortified to chaplains, pre-
bendai-ies, friars, and other places respectively
; and also that very many of our
lieges claimed right to, and recovered certain lands, tenements, and annual rents,
mortified by their predecessors by means of brieves of our chapel, or otherwise by
sasine, as
heirs
of their j)redecessors who formerly donated the same to the
church, which seems to have happened partly by the negligence of the ofhcers of
our said burgh, and partly by the collusion of said prebendaries, chaplains, vicars,
and friars above-written
:
Wherefore, with advice
foresaid, by
these presents
we rescind and annul all and sundry such alienations, dispositions, and
sasines,
by which the
first purpose and intention of the founders are infringed, altered,
or varied, by applying the same to particular uses, to the effect that they may
be converted to the uses above-written, which declaration of ours we will to be
of as much strength and efficacy as if the persons who obtained such dispositions
had been individually cited and their infeftments rescinded without further
lirocess
:
And
also, with
advice foresaid, we unite
and incorporate
all and
sundry the foresaid
lands, tenements,
houses,
buildings,
churches,
burying-
grounds, chapels,
orchards, gardens, acres,
croffcs, annual
rents, fruits,
duties,
profits, emoluments, rents, alms, obits, anniversaries, abodes of the friars, mills,
and fishings thereof, with their pertinents, into one budy for ever, to be called
our foundation for the ministers and hospitality of our said burgh of Inverness
:
We will also that one sasine by the foresaid Provost and bailies, or any of them,
in name of said community, at the Court-house of our said burgh, shall be ac-
cepted as sufficient sasine once for all, for ever, in future, as if the same, notwith-
standing the distance of the places, were taken upon the
particular lands per-
taining to said chaplains, prebendaries, vicars, and friars, or to foresaid annual
rents, anniversaries, rents, profits, and duties due to them
: Moreover, by thes-e
presents we forbid the
chaplains, prebendaries, vicars, and
friars, who before
said change of religion had been provided, to be prejudiced by this our present
infeftment, but we reserve to them the use of said fruits and duties during their
life only
:
Commanding, therefore, our chamberlains, present and future, and
their collectors and factors, and any other vphose interest it
is, that no one, iu
kind
or
in
specie, presume
to
receive
or levy said
fruits particularly above-
written for any time past or future, nor hinder and cause any impediment to
the foresaid Provost, bailies, councillors, and community, and their successors,
in peaceful possession thereof
;
also requiring and ordaining our Lords of Session
that they direct our letters in all the four forms, at the instance of said Provost,
^bailies, community, and their successors, to the
effect above written, and also
commanding intromittors whatsoever with said fruits that they promptly attend,
obey, and make thankful payment thereof to them..
In witness of which thing,
to this our present charter, we command our great seal to be appended.

JAMES VI.
1567-1599.
PART FIRST.
King James being but a year old at his coronation, a suc-
cession
of
the
nobility
strove
for and
wielded
power
as
Governors of the kingdom.
They might have the interest
of the country at heart, but showed by
their acts that they
mainly looked to
their own aggrandisement, and were con-
sistent only in the appropriation of ecclesiastical property.
Upon the 20th
of December
1567,
in
the
process
and
doom of forfeiture against the Earl of Bothwell, public pro-
clamation was ordered
to be made
at the Market Cross
of
Inverness
; and on 15th August 1568, in a summons against
John, some time Archbishop of St Andrews, and others, the
execution of the messenger bears that it was executed at the
Market Cross of Inverness.
The
first
Protestant minister in Inverness, Mr Thomas
Howieson, is said to have been appointed in 1568.
In June 1569
the Regent Moray was in Inverness, and
exacted considerable sums from those who assisted the Earl
of Huntly.
He sent, on 24th April previous, the following
letter to the Baron of Kilravock
:
True Friend, after our hearty commendation
: At this convention of the no-
bility, amongst other matters it
is concluded that all such as remain obstinate
and disobedient to the King our sovereign and his authority, shall be reduced
to the obedience thereof
; for which purpose we mind with the first to repair to
these parts, and have appointed the first day of June to be at Brechin.
Where-
fore, we most
affectuously
desire you that
ye, well and subtantiously accom-
panied with your haill kin, friends, servants, tenants, and
all that will do
for
you, fail not to be in the burgh of Inverness the said first day of June, ready to
come forward and meet or otherwise to receive such directions as shall be thought
good to the welfare of our cause
;
wherein ye shall do us most acceptable plea-
sure, and declare yourself an earnest favourer of the King our sovereign's autho-
rity, to the obedience whereof, in the end, all men must be brought.
This we
give you to God.
At Edinburgh, the 24th day of April 1569.—Your good friend,
James Regent.
To our true friend the Baron of Kilravock.
In
this same year
is found recorded the name of John
Eose, burgess of Inverness, and Margaret Vaus, his spouse.

Hugh
Fraser, Lord Lovat, was
Slierifit- Principal of In-
verness, and constable of the Castle, in 1574.
Of him, the
History of the Fraser Family relates
:
'^ His Lordship was
a great promoter of manly
sports, and an expert bowman.
It was a general custom in those days for all the nobility to
meet at stated periods, for the purposes of tilting, fencing,
riding the horses, and the
like exercises.
At one of tliese
rencontres in the Chapel-yard of Inverness, Lord Lovat dis-^
mounted the laird of Grant, and the Sheriff of Moray.
This,
with some taunt which
followed, so
irritated
these gentle-
men
as
to
occasion
sharp
words, when
Lovat
said
that
as he had given them a specimen of his
tilting, he would
now try the mettle of their riding.
Dashing the rowels into
his steed, he rode through the river, and made straight
for
the hill of Clachnaharry, bidding them keep apace
;
here he
leaped his horse over the ledge of the rock, and dared
his
pursuers to follow.
But they, terrified with the appearance
of the place judged it wisest to desist.
The impression, says
our author, made by his horse's shoes below, was visible for
upwards of sixty years after, as it was kept clean by a man
who had an annual pension for preserving it,"
At
Inverness, on
the
11th
day
of January
a.d.
1574,
Patrick Grant of Glenmoriston sells to Alexander Cuthbert,
burgess of Inverness, two roods of burgage land, built upon,
lying in the burgh of Inverness, near the Market Cross, be-
tween the lands of the heirs of the late George Cuthbert of
the Old Castle at
the east, and the lands of the late Robert
Waus, burgess of Inverness, at the west
;
whose fronts ex-
tend to the Market Cross of said burgh at the south, and the
backs to the common passage
at the
north.
The reddendo
is lOd, payable yearly to the King and his
successors, and
to the abbot and convent of Kinloss and their successors 6s
Scots, payable
at
the two
usual
terms, by equal
portions.
Alexander Paterson, one of the
bailies
of Inverness, gives
sasine.
The witnesses are the honest men, John Cuthbert,
burgess of Inverness
; David Cuthbert, there
;
John Name,
heir apparent of Cromdell
; John Stuart, alias M' Walter, in
Inverness
;
John
Bane,
cordiner
in
Inverness
;
William
Bane, squire
; Thomas Finlayson, officer of said burgh of In-
verness
; Jasper Cumming and William Cumming, notaries-
public
;
and William Cumming, Town-Clerk of Inverness,
acts as notary.

of fishings in the
River Ness from the Inshes collection is
interesting.
Here
will be seen indications of the
desire for
entails, which
re-
ceived legislative sanction in 1685.
The deed is dated 26th
January 1575, and contains
the names of the Provost, bai-

The following precept and command by the King to
the
authorities of Inverness, to attend at Edinburgh, on the 1st
of August then next ensuing, to account for their rents, cus-
toms, &c., is dated 9th May 1575
:
James, by the grace of God King of
Scots, to the Bailies and Collectors of
Customs of our burgh of Inverness
; Greeting
:
Since, with the advice and con-
sent of our
dearest
cousin James, Earl
of Mortoun, Lord Dalkeith, &c., our
Regent, and that
of our kingdom and
lieges, we have ordered our Exchequer
Court to be held at Edinburgh, and to begin on Wednesday, the 1st day of the

238
INVERNESSIANA.
month of August next to come, with
continuation of
days, we command and
order you that ye be there on the 20th day of said month, before the auditors of
our accounts, prompt and ready to render your account of
all and sundry rents,
returns, and customs due by you to
us, from the time of the rendering of last
account of your duties, carrying with you
all monies due by you to us, whose
terms
are,
or will then be elapsed, and also an account of the expenses, and of
the disposal of the common goods of said burgh, to be looked into by said audi-
tors to see if they were usefully disposed of or dissipated diffusely, and that ye
premonish all others having or pretending an interest herein fifteen days before
said day, conform to Act of our Parliament, and that this ye in nowise omit,
under the penalty of £10.
Given under testimony of our great seal, at Edinburgh,
the 9th day of the month of May, in the year of our reign the ninth, 1575.
To the Bailies and Custumariis of our burgh of Inverness,
in behalf of the Exchequer, &c.
The following instrument of sasine " of a piece of waste
land" sliows that the system of granting or fening out Burgh
property to high officials
is of some antiquity.
The date of
the charter on which the sasine proceeds
is 19th July L574
:
In the name of God, Amen.
By this present public instrument let it be evi-
dently patent and made known to all men, that in the year of the Incarnation
of our Lord 1575, and on the 1st day of the month of September, in presence of
me, notary-pviblic, and of the subscribed witnesses, there personally appeared the
prudent man William Cuthbert, Provost of the burgh of Inverness, who had and
held in his hands a charter made by the discreet men, viz., John Cuthbert, burgess
of the burgh of Inverness, Jasper Dempster, and William Gumming, burgesses and
bailies of said burgh of Inverness, under the manual subscriptions of said bailies
to the said William Guthbert and his heirs and assignees on one piece of waste land
of the said community of Inverness, lying within said burgh of Inverness, on the
south side of the wall of the late place of the Preaching Friars of
Inverness,
lying between the king's common highway at the east, at the south to the com-
mon passage or highway which leads to the water of Ness, between the Parish
Church of Inverness and the foresaid place of the Preaching Friars of Inverness,
between the king's common highway at the north and the wall of the place
of
the Preaching Friars of Inverness
at the west, according as
is in said charter
more fully contained, at the end of which the following precept of sasine was
added, under the form following, and
is thus
:—Moreover, we order and com-
mand our
beloved
Jasper
Dempster,
burgess of
Inverness, ....
and
each of you, conjunctly and separately, our bailies, that when ye see these pi'e-
sents, ye
go
the
one
or
other
of you
to
the
foresaid
piece
of
waste land
above-written, lying on the east of the wall of the place of the Preaching Friars
of Inverness, between the
king's common highway
at the
east, the common
highway which goes to the water of Ness at the south, the king's common high-
way at the north, and the wall of the Friars of Inverness at the west, and there
upon the

or other
of you
state,
sasine, and
hereditary possession thereof to the foresaid William Cuthbert, or to
his sure
attorney or procurator, lawful bearer of these presents, by delivery of earth and

to you and each of you, conjunctly and severally, we commit our full and
ir-
revocable power, by the tenor of these presents
:
In testimony of which thing,

JAMES VI.
1567-1599. PART THIRD,
In the Parliament held
at Edinburgh
in October 1579
James
Kynross was
Commissioner
of
the burgh, and in
1581 William BaiJlie is recorded as representative.
The following, being
the views
entertained of Scotland
and the Highlands at this period by a co-temporary, is taken
from a scarce small book in the French language, entitled,
^' La Eecerche des Singvlaritez plvs Remarqvables, concern-
ant 'estat d' Escosse," dedicated to the very august and very
merciful Princess Mary, Queen of Scotland and Dowager of
France, of date 1579, and the author of which subscribes
himself thus, "Yostre tres humble et tres obeissant Servi-
teur David Chambre, d' Ormont."
While writing of the
Church and
the
Saints, he remarks—" And among all the
other Christian kings, those of Scotland are not the
least
fortunate in having a great number of such devout men, as
natives
in
their own country, as
also some
strangers who
retired
thither, like Amphibolus, a native of that
country,
called the first bishop of Scotland, who lived about the year
274
;
St
Palladius,
called
the
Apostle
of
Scotland
;
St

240
INVERNESSIANA.
Eeo'uliis, who broiigbt the relics of St Andrew out of Greece;
St Kentigern, Bishop of Glasgow, and son of Eugenius IIL,
and nephew
of Lotht, king of the
Picts, by
his daughter
Themeta
;
St
Fiacre, who
died
in
France,
brother
of
Farquhar, King of Scotland;
Cornan, Ajdan, St
Colman,
St Finnan, all bishops;
St Aidannan, St Fothed, &c."
Under the title,
'' TEstat de Noblesse," we have—" All
the nobles called
^ my lords,' and some Sards' (lairds), as also
the bishops and prelates have vassals who hold their lands of
them in fief, commonly without high jurisdiction, and pro-
bably these
vassals have
others
called subvassals, and
all
these are obliged to serve their oldest superior against all others
save the king.
The greatest power for resisting enemies in
times of war consists in gentlemen, younger brothers, those
termed nobles, and some
lords, called
' lards,' and in those
of their posterity who are sustained as much with the reve-
nues which they have had
in
gift of their
parents, as by
what
they have
acquired
for
their
service
and
industry,
without having any other particular title of honour than that
they
are called
after the name of the village or possession
where they dwell."
Of the people of Scotland he says there are three kinds.
" In the second rank or degree are all those who speak the
the language called
' Gachtlet' (Gaelic),— after the name of a
certain Gatheius,—common to the Irish and some people of
the East Indies, as is proved by some Jesuits not long since.
In ancient times
this language was common to
all the
in-
habitants of Scotland.
Those of this rank are robust, strong,
courageous, brave, active; and they always observe entirely
their ancient manners, as
well in wearing a kind of dress,
as
in observing
great sobriety in
their food.
They
also
possess
several
large provinces
and
isles, which contain as
great an extent
of
land
as
the provinces which those of
the low country
occupy.
But
these
lands
of
this
second
part of Scotland are almost all moorish, full of woods and
mountainous.
They have also large fortresses fortified by na-
ture, not only sufficient to protect themselves and the others
of the low country
in case of necessity, when they
betake
themselves there, during the times of the first incursions of
enemies, but also by this means they have always in a short
time the means of attacking their enemies
;
so that in read-
ing the histories one will find this mode of succour to have
been one of the principal occasions
that the kings of Scot-
land have continued always free, without being subjects
to
any strangers.
The inhabitants of these lands are called in_
the Scottish tongue
' hechtlandmenj' in French
^ the people
y
n

INVERNESSIANA.
-
241
of the highlands.'
These are understood among the French
to be nothing less than
savages, yet they resemble them in
no_w^7'
Of the
sobriety
of the
Scots
he
says:—"All
historians prove that the
sobriety anciently observed by the
Scots and practised at present
(particularly by the inhabit-
ants of the Highlands, a race very patient to endure hunger
and all other
evils)
has
been one of the
chief occasions of
protecting the country of Scotland for so long a time against
ei:i£Xlltes."
In the year 1582 many Presbyterians having refused
to
pay the Bishops
their former
rents,
it was
ordered by the
Privy Council
that
all such
should
be
imprisoned
in the
Castle of Inverness.
Sutherland and Strathnaver were disjoined from the She-
riftdom of Inverness
in
the
jeav 1583.
The occurrence
is
thus
related by
Sir Robert Gordon
:—" The year of God
1583, Alexander, Earl of Sutherland, obtained the superior-
ity of Strathnaver, together with the heritable Sheriffship of
Sutherland and
Strathnaver, from
the Earl of Huntly, for
the
lordship of Aboyne, which gift of the Earl of Huntly
was confirmed by His Majesty's charter under his great seal,
whereby
Sutherland and
Strathnaver
were
disjoined and
dismembered from the Sheriffdom of Inverness."
In 1582 the burgh of Inverness renewed
their legal pro-
ceedings against Tain, as appears by the following document
endorsed " Town of Tayne, Ane Act betwix Tane and Inver-
ness"
:
At Edinburgh, the last day of February, the year of God 1582 years, anent our
Sovereign Lord's letters, pursued at the instance of the late Mr Robert Creytoun,
of Elrok, Advocate to our Sovereign Lord for the time, and the Provost, bailies, and
Council of the burgh of Inverness, against Andrew Ross, Adam Hay, DonaldM'Cra
Mor, Allan Andrew M'Hucheone, Walter Douglas, Andrew Crystesone, Andrew
Macculloch, Farquhar Reid, Donald Tailzeor, Walter M'Quhill, Thomas M'Jo-
seph, John Mor, elder, Alexander
M'Gillechrist, and
all and sundry persons,
inhabitants of the burgh of Tain, to hear and see our Sovereign Lord's letters
directed in all the four forms, and each form to be executed after the others
within three days, and the warding to be in the Castle of Blackness, in case of
disobedience, charging the said persons, inhabitants of the said town of Tain in
general, and by their names in special, as they shall be required, to desist and
cease from
all exercising and using of the freedoms and privileges of the said
burgh of Inverness, in buying of skins, hides, iron, salmon, and other merchan-
dise, to be brooked and enjoyed by the said pursuers, aye and until the said in-
dwellers in Tain show their privilege and freedom to the contrary, and aye until
they be lawfully called and orderly put therefrom by the law, conform to their
infeftments of the same, granted by our Sovereign Lord's noble progenitors, and
the said Lord's decreet given thereupon, of the
date 16th day of March, the
year of God 1500 years, in
all points, or
else to have alleged a reasonable cause
why the same should not have been done, as at more length
is contained in the
said letters
:
The said Provost and bailies of the said burgh of Inverness com-
pearing, by Mr Oliver Colt, their procurator, and Mr David McGill, now Advo-
cate to our Sovereign Lord, for his Highness'
interest, being personally present
in place of the said late Mr Robert Creytoun, advocate, who
is deceased, and
the^ said inhabitants of the said town of Tain compearing by Mr John Russell,
their procurator, who alleged that no letters ought to be granted against the said

inhabitants, because the said burgh of Tain is a free burgh, endowed and privi-
leged with all immunities of a free burgh holding of the king at the
least, ac-
coriiing to their erection into a free burgh, which is lawfully confirmed by the
king's predecessors, whereof they have been in possession of a free burgh past
memory of man, and therefore no letters should be directed as is desired, which
allegation the said Mr John offers himself to prove
sufficiently, and the same
being found relevant, they have assigned and assign to the said inhabitants of
Tain, the 15th day of April next to come, with continuation of days, for proving
of the said allegation sufficiently, and to that effect ordains them to have letters
to summon such
witnesses and probation, and to produce such writs, rights,
reasons, and documents as they have or will use for proving thereof, against the
said day, reserving to the said pursuers
all their defences contra producenda ;
and also supersedes the giving forth of the interlocutor upon other two
allega-
tions proposed by the said Mr John Russell, procurator foresaid in the said mat-
ter, until the same day, and in

1567-1599. PART FOURTH.
King James was always in an impecunious state, and the
Estates in 1583
voted him 20,000 pounds Scots for the ob-
jects stated in the narrative of the letters annexed.
The proportion payable by the burghs was £3333 6s 8d Scots,
and the letters command the Provost and
bailies of Inver-
ness to appoint stentors to uplift the sum due from the town.
The
proportion is not
stated, but this was unnecessary,
in
respect that
all Royal burghs had a
certain value placed
upon them by which the respective proportions were allo-
cated and determined.
The
seal
is
entire, and the
document, dated 20th April
1583, is endorsed ^^Lres taxatioun."
James, by the grace of God King of Scots, to our Provost and bailies of our burgh
of
Inverness, and
to
our
lovites,
messengers,
our
sheriffs
in
that
part,
conjunctly
and

specially
constituted
;
Greeting
:
Forasmuch, as we
being
come
at
the
pleasure
of God
to
this
estate
and
age, and understanding
the
necessary
occasions
urging us
to
have
the
aid
and
support
of
our
Estates,
touching
the
discharge and
relief
of
such
debts as have
been
contracted
in the
troublous times bypast of
our young
age,
as also for making
of such
charges as will be required toward the pre-
paration for our marriage, and
others and most needful and weighty
affairs,
concerning our honour and welfare, we, having now convened a good number of
our estates for their good advice in the premises, so as we may be at once re-
lieved of bygone duty, and good order to' be preserved for the honourable enter-
tainment of our Estate hereafter, our said estates presently assembled, after ma-
ture deliberation hereupon, willing to give us their best advice in all things, ac-
cording to their bounden duty, and to condescend to the support of our necessary
and honourable affairs to the utmost of their ability
:
Finding that the charges
requisite hereanent crave the presence of
a greater number of our estates, have
thought expedient therefore that the final resolution and advice upon our pre-

243
sent proposition shall be deferred
till the assembly of our estates in the next
parliament, to hold and begin, God willing, in our Tolbooth of Edinburgh, upon
Thursday the 24th day of October next to come, with of continuation days, or
to a new convention of our Estates in greater number than is presently assembled
and in respect of such needful charges as necessarily are to be provided for in
the meantime, which may not goodly
sujffer delay, our
said estates presently
convened have
willingly granted a taxation of twenty thousand pounds, to be
uplifted and paid by our said estates, to be counted and allowed in the first end
of that sum that shall be condescended upon by them at our next parliament or
convention, that is to say, ten thousand pounds by the spiritual Estate, j)rovid-
ing that the third thereof be taken of the thirds of
benefices, so that such as
pay their thirds shall only be astricted in payment of the two parts of the said
ten thousand pounds, and the ministry to be free for so much of the said thirds
as is assigned to them in their stipends, and so much as happens to be deducted
through that occasion to be added to the parts that have been ordained to be
paid by the other Estates
; six thousand six hundred thi-ee score and six pounds,
thirteen shillings, and four pence to be paid by the burghs and
free
holders,
together with our property, and three thousand three hundred and thirty-three
pounds, six shillings and eight pence, in complete payment of the said taxation
of twenty thousand pounds, by the burghs, and that at one term,
viz., upon the
first day of August next to come
; and for inbringing of our burgh's part of said
taxation and relief you the said Provost and bailies
: Our will is herefor, and we
charge you
strictly and command that incontinent, these our
letteis seen, ye
pass and in our name and authority command and charge the inhabitants of our
said burgh to convene and elect certain persons to stent their neighbours, and
that ye command the persons elected to accept this charge upon them in setting
the said stent upon the inhabitants of our said burgh, and to convene and set
the same, and make a stent roll thereupon, as
effeirs, within twenty-four hours
next after they be charged by you
thereto, under the pains
of
rebellion, and
putting of them to our horn, and if they fail therein the said twenty four hours
being bypast, that ye incontinent thereafter denounce the disobeyers our rebels,
and put them to our horn, and escheat and inbring all their moveable goods to
our use for their contempt, and so the said stent roll being made and set as said
is, that ye charge the burgesses, neighbours, and inhabitants of the said burgh
to make i)ayment of their part of the said extent to you, conform to the said taxed
roll to be made and given out thereupon within the space of three days next after
they be charged by you thereto, under the said pain of rebellion and putting of
them to our horn, and if they
fail therein, the said three
days being bypast,
that ye incontinent
thereafter denounce the disobeyers our rebels, and put them
to our horn, and escheat and inbring all their moveable goods to our use for their
contempt, and if need be that ye poind and distrain as ye shall think most ex-
pedient, as ye will answer to us thereupon
; the which to do we commit to you,
conjunctly and severally, our full power, by these our letters, delivering them
by you duly executed and endorsed again to the bearer.

JAMES VI.
1567-1599.
PART FIFTH.
At the time of acquiring the lands of the Preaching Friars
(see No.
85)
Provost
Cuthbert
appears
not
to
have had
enough
to
pay for
the
price, and
to have been
obliged to
borrow 200 merks from Alexander Bayne
of Tulloch, and
Agnes Fraser, his wife.
The Provost was able to redeem the
mortgage
in
1584, as
is
seen by the
following instrument

244
INVERNESSIANA.
of redemption and renunciation.
The notary, it will be ob-
served, drops all Papal reference in his dates
:
In the name ot God, Amen.
By this present public instrument be
it clearly
known to all, that in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord 1584, on the 29th
day of the month of May, in the eighteenth year of the most serene Prince
James VI., and sixth king of that name, in presence of me notary-public and the
witnesses underwritten, there compeared the honourable man, Alexander Bane
of TuUoch and Agnes Fraser, his wife, hereditary owner of all and sundry lands
•within the wall of the place of the Preaching Friars
of Inverness, both arable
and garden, removing and excepting the church and the passage to the church,
which lies between the water of Ness at the west and the
king's common
high-
way at the east, and the wall which lies at the common passage at the north, on
the north side
of the Parish Church of Inverness at the south, and the wall
which lies at the march at the north on both sides, lying within the burgh of
Inverness and sheriffdom thereof ; and also another piece of land built upon,
with the pertinents, lying within said burgh, on the eastern side of the wall of
the place of the Preaching Friars of Inverness, between the king's common high-
way at the east and south and the common passage or way which leads to the
water of Ness, between the Parish Church of Inverness and the place of the late
Preaching Friars of Inverness and the king's common highway at the north, and
the wall ot said place of the Friars at the west, of their own mere, pure, and
spontaneous will confessed, and by the tenor of this present public instrument,
confess, that the foresaid lands with their pertinents were held by them of the
Provost,
bailies,
council, and community of
Inverness, and were lawfully re-
deemed from them by the honourable man, William Cuthbert, burgess of Inver-
ness, hereditary owner and feudatory of
all and sundry foresaid
lands, with
their pertinents, by virtiie of letters of reversion of the foresaid Alexander Bane
of Tulloch and Agnes Fraser, his wife, to the foresaid William Cuthbert, his
heirs and -assignees, made for the reversion of all and sundry the foresaid lands,
with their pertinents, for the sum of 200 merks of the usual money of the king-
dom of Scotland, acording as in the letters of reversion is more fully contained,
and the premises all and sundry are fully and wholly contained in said letters of
reversion
: Moreover, the foresaid Alexander Bane of Tulloch and Agnes Fraser,
his wife, for themselves and their heirs and assignees, have renounced, according
as by the tenor of the present public instrument they renounce, all claim and
title of sasine which they had, have, or in any way shall have, to all and sundry
the foresaid lands, with their pertinents, in virtue of the alienation of the fore-
said William Cuthbert to us, in conjunct fee, and the heirs lawfully procreated
or to be procreated betwixt us and assignees whomsoever
:
And of
all and
sundry the said renunciation by the foresaid William
Cuthbert, by virtue
of
said letters of redemption and completion, and all and sundry therein contained,
the foresaid Alexander Bane of Tulloch and Agnes Fraser his spouse gave a charter
and precept of sasine, and sundry documents requisite made regarding foresaid
lands to the foresaid William Cuthbert really and with effect
: On all and sundry
which the foresaid William Cuthbert sought of me notary-public underwritten
public instruments one or more

at Holyrood House as
Commissioner

Inverness, and

In the Parliament held at Edinburgh that year appoint-
ment is made
" for the furtherance and furthsetting of the
criminal justice over all the realm."
" Justice aires shall be
held twice every year in time coming
over all
the shires
of
this realm in the months of April and October." The course to
be pursued is thus set forth
:
" And to the effect that all execu-
tions and arrestments requisite may be duly prepared before
the coming of the said Justice-Deputes,
it is statute and or-
dained that our sovereign Lord, with advice of his Chancel-
lor, Treasurer, and Justice-Clerk,
shall nominate and give
commission to honourable and worthy persons, being known
of honest fame and esteemed no maintainers of evil or op-
pression, and

on matters relating to the Isles, as follows
:
Right trusty Cousin and Counsellor, we greet you heartily well. We doubt not
but the cruelties and disorders in the Isles these years bygone have greatly moved

you, whereanent we intend, God willing, to take some siiecial pains
ourself, as
well there as in the Borders, where we have been lately occupied (we directed
our mind unto you what we thought raetest to be done in this behalf in October
last, not doubting but you have been careful thereof since then.)
Always fear-
ing that the Islesmen within the bounds of your lieutenancy shall press to make
some rising and gathering, before conveniently we may put order to the matters
standing in controversy in the West Isles, we desire you effectuously that with all
goodly diligence you send to Donald Gorme's son M'Cloydof the Lewis, M'Cloydof
the Harrich, the Clanrannald, and others being of power in these parts, willing
and commanding them to contain themselves in quietness, and that they forbear
to make any manner of convention or gatherings, to the hinder and disturbance
of our good deliberation, for we have written effectuously to Angus M'Conell,
and have spoken with M'Clane, being here for the same
effect.
And so not
doubting but you
will do what in you lies, that all things remain quiet and in
good order within the bounds of your charge, as ye will do us special and accept-
able service, commit you in the protection of Almighty God.

Seeing the numerous changes
taking
place,
the
burgh
appears to have been anxious that their various possessions

248

sliould be assured
to
them,
hence
they applied
for, and
obtained from the King, after the attainment of his lawful
age, the following
confirmation in regard to the old King's
Milns, and the dry and astricted multures of the lands thirled
tliereto.
The Balloch
Hill is the part of the ridge of Alt-
naskiach nearest to Inverness, and the mills are supposed to
have been at the foot of the hill, near the Haugh Brewery.
The remains of a mill-lade have been frequently observed,
having its intake opposite to Bellfield, and its course rather
nearer the foot of the hill than the present Dores Road

ness,
for pacific possession and enjoyment of the premises, as if the same had
been given and granted of old, word
for word by our most noble progenitors
:
Moreover, of new with advice and consent of our computers of the roll, we have
given and granted, and by the tenor of our present charter give and grant full
power and liberty to the said Provost and bailies, the councillors and community

built or to be built, in hurt and prejudice of our said burgh, and of the disposi-
tion of the multures above specified, shall be demolished, pulled down, and de-
stroyed

Master
Oliver
Coult,

The salary

Many dis-
tinguished lawyers held the office subsequently, and among
others,

is
thought, was Twenty Pounds Scots

Falconer, Lady Kilravock, because she could not write.
In
the same year the old feuds betwixt the families
of
Huntly and Mackintosh again broke out with great violence,
the Gordons invading and wasting Petty and Culloden, and
stirring up Lochiel and Keppoch to waste and harry Bade-
noch and Strathspey.
On the other hand, the Mackintoshes,
with the assistance of the Grants, not only defended them-
selves, but invaded Auchindown and
the
Cabrach.
The
Town of Inverness became mixed up in these quarrels, and
alwavs sided with the Mackintoshes.

The following charter of the lands of Drummond, formerly
and
still in
the
Gaelic termed Drumdevan
(the ridge
of
shelter), dated 5th February 1591, is naturally an object of
special interest to the writer of this book.

As
the lands
of Drummond were counted a part of the
territory of the burgh,
it followed that the doings of Robert
Waus, in connection with Drummond, put the Magistrates
and Council of Inverness in a ferment.
They no doubt de-
nounced him as solemnly as ever any
ecclesiastic did whose
lands had been violently seized.
They also disbarred him from
all burgess
rights, and his possessions and
tacks, as will be
seen by the contract after-quoted, wherein he is designed
as
'^ Kobert Waus, sometime burgess, and now only inclweller of the
said burgh."
The power of the burgh was not to be success-
fully resisted, hence Waus, after some years of conflict,
re-
nounced his charter and rights to Drumdevan, and the burgh
replaced him in his civic
rights, all as detailed
at length in
the following contract, which is dated 2d June 1595
:
At Inverness, the 11th day of June, the year of God 1595 years, it is appointed,
concorded, finally ended, and agreed betwixt honourable and discreet persons and
parties underwritten
: That
is to say, Alexander Cuthbert, Provost of the burgh
of Inverness
; George Gumming, William Eobertson, Finlay Macphail, and Thomas
Cuthbert elder,
bailies and burgesses of the said burgh, with advice and consent
of John Cuthbert of Auld
Castle-hill, Mr John Eose, William Cuthbert, Alex-
ander Gumming, James Waus,
burgesses and Council of the said burgh, on the
one part, and Robert Waus, sometime
biu-gess, and now only in-dweller of the
said burgh, on the other part, in manner, form, and effect, as follows
: That is to
say
; Forasmuch as the said Robert Waus being most justly deprived of all liberty
and freedom which he has of the burgh of Inverness, as also being justly deprived
. by the laws of this realm of
all
his possessions and tacks which he enjoys and
holds immediately of the Provost,
Bailies, Council and community of the burgh
of Inverness, and their successors, and that for the wrongous and fraudful omit-
ting furth of our sovereign lord's signature and confirmation granted to the burgh
of Inverness, of the town and land of Drumdivan, under specified, being a pendicle
and commonty to the burgh of Inverness, with all crofts and pendicles belonging
thereto, which general confirmation to the burgh of Inverness, upon their haUl
lands and possessions, the said Robert Waus was directed by consent of Provost,
Bailies, and Council, to obtain in favour of the burgh of Inverness, and then* suc-
cessors,
in doing and performing whereof,
he,
as commissioner
foresaid, most
wrongously left out of the
said
signature and confirmation the said town and
land of Drumdivan, with the crofts thereof, and has most wrongously aj)propriated
the same to his own particular use, by taking of infeftment thereupon in his own
person, as the i^rocess of deprivation led thereupon contrar the said Robert Waus
most justly proports
: Always [albeit] the said Provost, Bailies, and Council fore-
said, being moved of mercy towards the said Robert Waus, their neighbour, and
understanding perfectly his willing intention and mind to denude himseK and his
heirs of all heritable right, title, interest,
property, and possession that he or his
heiis had, have, or may i^retend to the said lands of Drumdivan, crofts and pen-
dicles thereof, and to dispone and transfer the same in the persons of the said Pi'O-

INVERNESSIANA.
253
vost, Bailies, Council, and commiinity of the burgh of Inverness, and their su.c-
cessors, to remain and abide with them heritably and irredeemably for ever, in
recomi)ence and satisfaction of his,
the said Robert's,
offence foresaid, done and
committed by him against the said burgh of Inverness
:
Therefore, and for the
causes underwi-itten, the said Provost,
Bailies,
and
Council,
above named,
for
themselves and then- successors, have renounced and discharged, and by the tenor
hereof renounces, and simpliciter discharges the sti'ength, force, and effect, of the
said decreet of deprivation,
obtained at the procurator-fiscal's instance, contrar
the said Robert "NVaus, by vii'tue whereof the said Robert is depi'ived of all liberty
and j)ossessions which he has of the burgh of Inverness, the said decreet being of
the date the thu-d day of June 1592 years, which decreet, with all that has followed
or may follow thereupon, the said Provost,
Bailies, and
Cou.ncil, for themselves
and their successors, will and grant that the same shall remain and abide ineffec-
tual for ever
: And will and grant that the same
shall never make faith in judg-
ment or outwith judgment, contrar the said Robert Waus, and his heirs, wherever
the same shall ha^jpen to be produced hereafter
: And fui-ther, for the said Robert
Waus' further secimty, the said Provost, Bailies, and Council, oblige them within
eight days after the date hereof, to

his jpossessions, which he holds immediately of the said burgh of Inverness, and

The
southern extremity of Drumdevan extended
to
the
Burn of Hohne, and overhanging the burn, in a commanding
position, was a tortaiice
called
'' The
Glack,"
whereof the
foundations still remain.
This part of Drumdevan was feued
by the burgh to Alexander Mackintosh " of ye Holme" as
early as 6th June 1607, for a yearly feu-duty of £10 Scots,
and is the property of Alexander's representative, the present
Angus Mackintosh of Holme.
The remainder of Drummond
was feued about a century ago to Phineas Mackintosh, Pro-
vost of Inverness, great granduncle of the present proprietor.
The ancient name of Lochardill has been
lately
revived, as
may be noted on referring to the Ordnance Map of the Parish.

XCIII.
JAMES VI.
1567-1599.
PART NINTH.
Upon the
1st of January 1591, the King granted to the
burgh the important and comprehensive
charter, quoted in

INVERNESSIANA.
255
this and the following chapter, which is known as the Golden
Charter of the Burgh.
It ratifies most
of the prior ones,
from the time of William
the
Lion, and grants new lauds
and
rights.
Many of the heritable rights have been lost,
such as the right of pasture,
peats, feal, and turf, on Craig
Phadrick, Caiploch,
Daviot, and Bogbain, and the right of
ferrying upon Loch Ness.
The following is an exact copy of
the charter
:
James, by the Grace of God, King of Scots, to
all good men of this whole land,
both cleric and laic
: Greeting
: Be it known that we, after our lawful and perfect
age, complete
of twenty-five
years, and onr general and last
revocation,
con-
sidering the ancient erection of our burgh of Inverness, by our famous progenitors
of hapi^y memory, into a free burgh of the Kingdom, and seriously examining the
long antiquity, the good and pleasant situation of our said burgh, and that by the
industry thereof, and the inhabitants therein to beyond
sea, commerce, negotia-
tion, and navigation, and merchandizing of the free burgesses of our said burgh,
the Eevenues of our Crown are augmented, our Kingdom increased and brought
to utility, and understanding our said burgh on every
sidfi to bo environed with
great, troublesome, and rebellious tribes or clans, tending to the detriment of our
Kingdom, and discommoding of our Crown, and that it may be better preserved
to us and our
successors, for all time coming,
that our
said
burgh, and
all the
donations of lands, i)atrimonies, revenues, liberties, piivileges, profits, commodities,
and casualties granted to our said burgh, and to the Provost, aldermen,
bailies,
councillors, btu'gesses, and community of the same, and to their successors, may
be observed and defended, and may be adorned and augmented with more ample
liberties, patrimonies, and revenues
; therefore, these things moving us, and for
several other reasonable causes and considerations, moving our mind by our own
sure knowledge and proper motions, with advice and
exj)ress consent and assent
of our faithful and beloved Counsellor, John Lord Thirlstane, our Chancellor ; Sir
Eobert Melville of Murdocarne, Knight, our Treasurer
; John Cockburn of Ormis-
ton, Elnight, our Justice Clerk
; David Seaton of Parbooth, Euler of our Accounts,
and Mr Robert Douglas, Provost of Lincludine, our Collector-General and Trea-
sui'er of our new augmentations ; have ratified and apx^roved, and for us and our
successors perpetually confirmed,
and by the tenor of our present
charter, we
ratify and approve, and for us and our successors perpetually confirm,
all and
sundry the charters,
confirmations, infeftments,
rights,
titles,
securities, letters,
wribings, evidents, donations, concessions, commodities, liberties, emoluments, and
privileges, contained in the same, made, given, grantbd, and confirmed, by us and
our famous Progenitors, being Kings and Queens of this our Kingdom for the time,
to our foresaid burgh, and the Provost, Aldermen, Bailies, Councillors, Burgesses,
and community of the same, and to their successors of whatsomever forms, tenors,
or giftings, the saids charters, infeftments, confirmations, rights, titles, securities,
letters, writs and evidents, donations, concessions, commodities, liberties, immuni-
ties, and privileges contained in the same, made, given, granted, and confirmed by us
and our famous progenitors
of happy memory. King William, King Alexander,
King David, and King James the
First, Kings of Scotland,
for the time, to our
said burgh, and to the Provost, Aldermen,
Bailies,
Councillors,
Burgesses, and
community of the same, and to their successors of the same, and moreover, the
charter and confirmation lately made and granted by our famous great-grandfather
of blessed memory. King James the Fourth of that name,
likewise the charter

reign of our foresaid late beloved mother, the 25th year
: And we will and grant,
and for us and our successors i)erpetually do enact and ordain that the said gene-
rality shall nowise hurt, offend, or bring prejudice to the said speciality, and that

256

and that this our present approbation,
ratification, and confirmation of the pr^-

and of so great
valvie,
strength, and
sufficiency,
to our said burgh of Inverness,
the Provost, Aldermen,
Bailies,
Councillors,
Burgesses, and community thereof,
and to their successors, as
if
gifts,
charters, infeftments,
confirmations,
rights,
titles, securities, letters,
writs, and evidents, had been i^articularly confirmed by
us and her in our present charter and confu-mation, word by word, at length in-
serted and incorporated, notwithstanding that
b,y reason of plurality, multitudo,
leng-th, and i^rolixity of the same, they need nowise be inserted or incorporated,
according to. this and other defects whatsomever, for us and our successors dispense
by thftse presents
: Moreover, we with advice,

JAMES
VI.
1567-1599.
PART TENTH.
The remainder of the King's
charter
is now given.
The
rights of petty customs of all the towns and villages in the
north, even to Wick,
to be applied
to the public good of
Inverness, have long been
lost,
if, indeed, they were ever
exacted, as we]l as the trading monopoly betwixt Inverness
and Tarbetness.
The island of Clava, one of the Orkneys, though not men-
tioned in
this
charter,
or in any other that has been exa-
mined, belonged also to the burgh of Inverness.
It was
never of much value, and was disponed in 1675 to James
Moncrieff, of Edinburgh, for the sum of £133
6s 8d, and a
feu duty of £2 Scots per annum
:
Moreover, we, with advice, express consent and assent of our foresaids, have
given and granted, as by the tenor of these presents we give, grant, and for us
and our successors perpetually confirm to the foresaids Provost, Bailies, Coun-
cillors, Burgesses, and community of our said burgh of Inverness, and their succes-
sors, that they should be all time coming crowners [coroners] within themselves,
and that they shall have liberty and jurisdiction within the said burgh of Inver-
ness,
in
all Justice-aires and Courts
of Justice, and
in
other Courts what-
somever, crowners of their own fellow-burgesses, dwelling in our said burgh of
Inverness, whom themselves. Provost,
Bailies,
Councillors
of
the same, and
their successors, at their own pleasure yearly, and for so long time as they will
please, have thought fit to be chosen, and likewise that all time coming they shall
have and may have within themselves a Sheriff of their own fellow-burgesses,
dwelling in our said burgh of Inverness, whom the said Provost, Bailies, Coun-
cillors, and their successors, according to their pleasure yearly, and for every
year they will, and think fit to be chosen, which crowners and sheriffs of our said
burgh of Inverness shall have, by their own charter, the full and free power and
authority of our heirs and
successors. Kings
of
Scotland,
of
administrating,
exercising, and governing of the full and whole
offices
of crowners and sheriffs
within our said burgh of Inverness, and liberties
of the same, and the foresaid

Inverness
: As also the said weekly markets of the foresaid eight free fairs, of
justly correcting transgressors
in them, and duly punishing excesses, amercia-
ments, fines, escheats, commodities, casualties,

ing from them, of lifting and gathering them, with
all rent, escheats, amercia-
ments, commodities, and fines of the Courts and Jurisdictions of the same, the

in time coming
: And with
all customs, anchor-
age, and commodities of the foresaid ports and havens, and with all and sundry
the ferm dues, customs, tolls, profits, commodities,
casualties, and other things
foresaid, we, by these j)resents,
give,
grant, and for us and our successors per-
petually confirm, to our foresaid Provost,
Bailies,
Councillors, and community
of our said burgh of Inverness, and their successors for ever, to the upholding,

of their offices
:

as to the said Crowners and Sheriffs, and those who hold their places, and de-
putes who shall be for the time, in all and sundry things pertaining to the said
offices of Crowners and Sheriffs, that they answer, obey, and apply themselves
promptly under pain

JAMES VI.
1567-1599. PART ELEVENTH.
The Earl of Huntly, Sheriff cf Inverness, and Keeper of
the Castle of Inverness, at Aberdeen, on the 11th February
1592, wrote the following
letter to the Provost, bailies, and
Council of Inverness, to fortify the town with walls against
unreasonable adjacent clans and Highlandmen, meaning by
his " professed enemies"
the Clan Ohattan.
As the paper
is much decayed, the writing crabbed and
contracted, and
the
spelling
singular,
it was with
difficulty
that the
fol-
lowing modernisation has been effected
:
Trusty friends, after hearty commendation, it is not yet out of your remem-
brance that the King served a charge to you which was delivered in Elgin, to
fortify and wall your town to the
effect ye might be the more able to do his
highness
service and us pleasure, in keeping of yourselves unhurt, unharmed,
or in any sort oppressed with such unreasonable clans as are most adjacent to
you, and in special, such as our professed enemies
: In respect whereof we will
earnestly desire you with all convenient expedition to put hand and make your
town so strong by walls and fosses as your ability will serve, in doing whereof
ye
shall have our assured concurrence and aid
to maintain you as our
old
defenders under his highness
:
"VVe have taken upon us that ye
shall not
be
troubled by our highlandmen, and have passed an assurance to you upon your
good deserving to us in times to come, reserving the rest to your diligence in this
your own cause, as well as to do us
service, we commit you to God.
At Aber-
deen, the 11th of February 1592.—Your very trusty friend,
Huntlye.
Upon the 29th March 1592 James, Earl
of Moray, ob-
tains ratification of his infeftments, among others, the town
and lands of Cullard, with the tower and
fortalice thereof,
the Broadland (Borlum), one-half of the
lands of Holm,
with the salmon and other fishings thereof in the water of
Ness, &c., within the parishes of Dores and Inverness.
Upon the
9th March 1593
the
Earl
of Huntly
is
in
trouble, and a commission is granted to John, Earl of Athole,
Lord Balvany, as His Majesty's Commissioner within the
bounds of the shires of Elgin, Forres, Nairn, Inverness, and
Cromarty, " to pass, search, seek, and take George, Earl of
Huntly, William, Earl of Angus, Francis, Earl
of Errol,"
and others, as
Papists, and as practising against the estate
of the true
religion, and for
the burning of Donniebristle,
and murder of James, Earl of Moray.
He is instructed
to
concur, fortify, and assist the Earl Marishall, and
for
this
effect
to
repair
to him
with
his
forces,
within
the
said
bounds, at such times as the necessity
shall
so
require, or
as
he
shall
be
advertised
or
desired
by
the
said
Earl
Marishall.

The following curious agreement betwixt The Mackintosh
and the Magistrates of Inverness with reference to the house
and fortalice called the Steeple of Inverness, dated at Inver-
ness, the 10th day of September 1593, is from the Mackin-
tosh charters
:
Forasmuch as Lachlan Mackintosh of Dunachton, one of the Commissioners
granted to Andrew Lord Ochiltrie and John Earl of Athole for prosecuting of
George Earl of Huntly and his accomplices for the slaughter of the Earl of
Moray, as the said Commission at more length proports, being
truly informed
that the Earl of Huntly is assembling to persecute the said Lachlan Mackintosh,
his friends and partakers, also the house of Inverness which was delivered by
the King's authority and charges to John Earl of Athole, Lord of Balveny and
lieutenant from Spey northward, undischarged as yet,
for
the
which causes,
above written, the said Lachlan Mackintosh, one of
the commissioners foresaid
has charged the provost, bailies, council, and community of Inverness to render
and deliver the house and fortalice called the steeple of Inverness into his hands
for defending of the town and
lieges from the invasion of the Earl of Huntly
;
which provost,
bailies,
council and community,
all in one voice, have bound
and obliged them to keep the foresaid steeple and fortalice thereof from the said
Earl of Huntly, to their own use and utility, without the King's i^ower, authority
and charge passed by the King's majesty and council, and in case we do the
contrary to the said Lachlan Mackintosh and his kin, we owe the deadly feud
of the said Lachlan Mackintosh, his kin, friends, assisters and partakers on us
and ours
: And for the verification
of this we have subscribed these presents
with our hands
: At Inverness, the 10th day of September, the year of God 1593
years, before these witnesses
:—
"VVm. Macqueen of Coi'rebroche, John M'Ferson

to
^' the
aged,
diseased, and infirm, they paying such reasonable composi-
tion therefor, for the furtherance of this service, chiefly the
payment of the wages of horsemen and footmen, &c."
These
treasons are said
to have been highly aggravated, by their
taking place " even in this time appointed for his Highness's
baptism
of his
dearest son
the
Prince, whom God
in his
mercy has granted
to the consort of this nation, by the as-
sistance and witnessing of the Sovereign Princes

1595, it was ordained the Presbyteries
in
all parts of the
county do proceed against the Papists within their bounds,

with the sentence of excommunication, and because of the
weakness of the Presbytery of Inverness,
ordains them to
proceed therein with the advice of Masters George Munro,
John Munro, John Mackenzie, and Andrew Crombie.
In 1596
are recorded the names of Alexander Cuthbert,
Provost of Inverness, and John Cuthbert,
of Auld
Oastle
hill; and in 1597 Mr Thomas Howieson, minister of Inverness.
In June of this latter year, according to Melville's Auto-
biography and Diary (1551-1610),
^^a deputation of minis-
ters went this summer through the provinces
of Aberdeen,
Moray, and Ross, to complete, as far as possible, the plant-
ing of them with ministers.
The Chief of the Clan Mac-
kintosh surprised the deputation by the zeal and cordiality
he showed towards the object.
He met them at Inverness,
exhibited a plan
for
settling ministers
in his country, and
subscribed it in their presence.
' Now,' said he,
' it may be
thought I am
liberal because nae minister will venture to
come among us.
Get me men and say
(try) me.
I will
find sufficient caution in St Johnston, Dundee, or Aberdeen,
for safety of their persons, obedience
to
their doctrine and
discipline, and guid payment of their stipend.' "
In 1597, in a Parliament held at Edinburgh on the 19th

Our Sovereign Lord, with advice
of the Estates of this present Parliament,
considering that the inhabitants of the Highlands and
Isles of this realm, which
are

not
only-

th6x_h^Y?.Ukewise through

it
is statute and ordained, that
all

JAMES VI.
1567-1599.
PART SIXTEENTH AND FINAL.
Much of what is recorded in this and the preceding chapter
relates to the lands of the Friars.
The family of Cuthbert
shared prominently in the spoils of the
Church
;
that of
Eobertson of Inshes comes,
about

time, prominently
forward ;
and two remoter
degrees of the family of Dun-
maglass
have
been
preserved
through
the
circumstance

Alister,
chieftain of
the
sept,
having
in
1578
acted
as
procurator
for
Margaret
Kar,
wife
of
Provost
Cuth-
bert.
The son of this Alister, named Farquhar M^Alister,
received a feu of Dunmaglass from Campbell of Cawdor in
1626, and in the litigations consequent on the death of the
late John Lachlan Macgillivray of Dunmaglass, none of the

father, Allister, who has been handed down by tradition as
^'Allister More."
Here
however, we have
the names
of
Allister's
father and grandfather, Farquhar and Duncan,
which latter probably lived prior to 1500
