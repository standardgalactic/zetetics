Deciphering construction rules in swarms 
4 
With the notable exception of Man, insect societies are living organisms that build the most 
5 
diverse and complex forms of architecturei (see Figures 1 & 2). The nests built by ants, wasps, 
6 
bees and termites play a crucial role in the growth and survival of colonies. The amazing 
7 
evolution of construction techniques used by social insects has provided a whole set of 
8 
innovations in terms of architectural designs that proved to be efficient to solve problems as 
9 
various as controlling nest temperature, ensuring gas exchanges with the outside environment or 
10 
adapting nest architecture to growing colony sizeii. The big question is: how these efficient 
11 
designs emerge from the combination of millions of local building actions performed by 
12 
individual workers? The explanation for these phenomena lies in the interactions between these 
13 
workers and it has been provided more than fifty years ago by French biologist Pierre-Paul 
14 
Grassé, who has introduced the concept of stigmergyiii.  
15 
 
16 
Stigmergy in a nutshell 
17 
There is no master architect, nor even a supervisor in these colonies. Grassé has shown that the 
18 
key information required to ensure the coordination of building actions performed by insects was 
19 
provided by their previously achieved work: the architecture itself. Grassé coined the term 
20 
stigmergy from the Greek words stigma, meaning « sting » and ergon meaning « work » to 
21 
describe this form of indirect communication. For instance, each time an ant or a termite worker 
22 
executes a building action, in response to a local stimulus, such as adding or removing a piece of 
23 
material from the existing nest structure, it modifies the stimulus that has triggered his action. 
24 
The new stimulus will then influence other specific actions from that worker or potentially from 
25 
any other workers in the colony. The stimulus itself can be a particular pattern of matter 
26 
sometimes soaked with chemical signals called pheromones. Coordination is simply achieved 
27 
through judiciously chosen stimulating patterns of matter. And the architecture provides enough 
28 
information and constraints to ensure the coordination and regulation of building actions. The 
29 
whole chain of stimuli and behavioral responses leads to an almost perfect collective construction 
30 
that may give the impression that the whole colony is following a well-defined plan. Thus, 
31 

 
2 
individual insects do not need any representation or any blueprint to build their nest. My 
32 
colleagues and I have spent the last twenty years identifying and characterizing the interactions 
33 
involved in the coordination of nest building in various species of waspsiv, antsv and termitesvi. 
34 
This work has led us to identify similar building principles behind the impressive diversity of 
35 
insect nest architectures and to build distributed construction models that implement these 
36 
principles.

Assembling molded paper cells 
39 
A nice example of stigmergic behavior is provided by nest building in social wasps. The vast 
40 
majority of wasp nests are built with wood pulp and plant fibers that are chewed and cemented 
41 
together with oral secretions (see figure 3). The resulting paper is then shaped by the wasps to 
42 
build the various parts of the nest: the pedicel, which is a stalk-like structure connecting the comb 
43 
to the substrate, the cells that are building blocks from which a comb is made of, or the external 
44 
envelope that protect the combs. Building activities are driven by the local configuration of cells 
45 
that are detected by wasps as they move on the surface of the nestvii. To decide where to build a 
46 
new cell, wasps use the information provided by the local arrangement of cells on the outer 
47 
circumference of a comb (see figure 4). However, potential building sites do not have the same 
48 
probability to be chosen by wasps when they start to build a new cell. Wasps prefer to add new 
49 
cells to a corner area where three adjacent walls are already present, while the probability to start 
50 
a new row, by adding a cell on the side of an existing row, is very low.  
51 
 
52 
Same rules, different patterns 
53 
We have investigated the consequences of applying these local rules on the development of 
54 
combs and on the resulting nest architecture with a simple individual-based modelviii. In this 
55 
model, wasps are represented by asynchronous agents moving in a three-dimensional discrete 
56 
hexagonal space, and whose building actions are controlled by a stochastic response function to 
57 
the state of the local environment. Each agent only detects the first twenty-six neighboring cells 
58 
that are adjacent to the cell it occupies at a given time, and it does not have any representation of 
59 
the nest architecture to be built. Each agent follows a simple set of construction rules that have 
60 
been determined by the analysis of experimental data (see figure 5). Some of these configurations 
61 
trigger a building action, and as a consequence, a new cell is added to the comb at the particular 
62 

 
3 
place that was occupied by the agent. In all the other cases, no particular building action takes 
63 
place and the agent just moves toward another place. As construction rules are stochastic, we can 
64 
implement in the model the probability values associated with each particular configuration of 
65 
cells that have been estimated from experimental data. The simulations of the model reproduced 
66 
the growth dynamics and the shape of the natural nests showing that the complexity of these 
67 
architectures does not require sophisticated construction rules. Moreover the exploration of the 
68 
morphospace has revealed that a whole variety of nest architectures that closely match those 
69 
found in nature can be built with simple stigmergic algorithms (see Figure 6).  
70 
 
71 
From stigmergy to self-organization 
72 
Stigmergic interactions are also involved in a large number of spatial patterns built by social 
73 
insects, such as networks of pheromone trails, epigeous nest architectures or underground 
74 
foraging galleries in ants and termites. However the dynamics and the properties of these 
75 
emerging patterns are quite different from what has been seen previously in wasps’ nests 
76 
construction. Indeed, in that case, stigmergic interactions between individuals promote positive 
77 
feedbacks that create the patterns and act for their subsistence against negative feedbacks that 
78 
tend to eliminate them. In social insects, these positive feedbacks may result from several kinds 
79 
of behaviors such as imitation, recruitment, reinforcement processes and are usually implemented 
80 
under the form of individual responses to stimuliix. In combination with negative feedbacks that 
81 
may take the form of saturation, exhaustion (i.e. pheromone evaporation) or competition, these 
82 
positive feedbacks are the two basic ingredients of self-organization in biological systemsx. A 
83 
wide range of studies demonstrated that self-organization was a major component of a wide range 
84 
of collective behaviors in social insects but also in many group-living animals and human 
85 
crowdsxi.  
86 
 
87 
Piling up mud balls 
88 
Together with the emergent properties, non-linear interactions lead self-organized systems to 
89 
bifurcations. A bifurcation is the appearance of new stable solutions when some of the system’s 
90 
parameters change. This corresponds to a qualitative change in the collective behavior. In the 
91 
case of ant nest construction, a pheromone added to the building material by the workers is a key 
92 
parameter that controls the shape transitions in the nest structure. In the garden ant Lasius niger, 
93 
we have shown that the pheromone stimulates the deposition of building material. As a 
94 

 
4 
consequence, ants tend to accumulate more material at the same place, thus creating a positive 
95 
feedback. Piling up mud pellets rapidly leads ant workers to build pillars. Then, once pillars have 
96 
reached a critical height, workers start to add pellets on their sides; and they use their body as a 
97 
kind of template to decide at which height they stop to increase the size of the pillar and start to 
98 
build a roof. 
99 
 
100 
Environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity 
101 
The air temperature in the surrounding environment has a dramatic consequence on the shape of 
102 
roofs built by ants over the pillars. When temperature increases, we got a transition from a large 
103 
number of thin pillars topped with capitals with a globular shape, to a small number of larger 
104 
pillars covered with thin horizontal roofs (see figure 7). To understand the construction dynamics 
105 
that leads to this shape transition, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model in which 
106 
we have incorporated the behavior of ants characterized in the experimentsxii. In the model, ant 
107 
workers are represented by agents whose behavioral rules are modeled according to probabilities 
108 
to perform simple elementary actions depending on the current state of the environment around 
109 
the agent (see figure 8). The model showed that the evaporation rate of the building pheromone is 
110 
a highly influential parameter on the resulting structures (see figure 9). The functional 
111 
consequences are quite unexpected since without changing building rules a shape transition is got 
112 
for free, simply driven by the evaporation rate of the building pheromone. So when temperature 
113 
increases, ants build shelters that are much more appropriate for their protection. And this feat is 
114 
not encoded in their own behavior: it is a genuine product of the interplay between the 
115 
construction process and the chemical properties of the building pheromone. Further explorations 
116 
of the model also revealed that the building rules identified in ants are able to generate some 
117 
unexpected complex structures such as helicoidal ramps (see Figure 10). Thus in social insects, 
118 
self-organization enables a real economy of the amount of code that is required at the individual 
119 
level to get these amazing nest architectures.  
120 
While being extremely simple, stigmergy is a powerful mechanism for coordinating the building 
121 
actions of myriads of simple-minded creatures. Traces left and modifications made by groups of 
122 
insects in the environment may feed back on them and organize in turn their collective behavior. 
123 
It is also a powerful mechanism for reshaping and optimizing the extended phenotypexiii of 
124 
colonies when they face challenging and variable environmental conditions.

Figure 1. Nests of the African genus of termites Apicotermes are constructions made out of clay 
129 
whose shape resembles that of an old pottery designed and made by skilled craftsmenxiv. This is 
130 
one of the most complex structures ever built in the animal kingdom by a group of animals and it 
131 
requires the coordination of building actions of thousands of tiny blind creatures.  
132 
 
133 
Figure 2. A virtual tour inside an Apicotermes nest reveals beautiful spiral staircases and the 
134 
sophisticated harmony of its architecture. Here computer tomography shows that the inner 
135 
architecture resembles a parking garage in which regularly spaced floors delimiting chambers are 
136 
connected by helicoidal ramps. This architectural complexity is even much more remarkable 
137 
because of the sharp contrast that exists with the behavioral simplicity of the workers that have 
138 
built it.

3D discrete space, having access to local space and time information and acting on a pure 
150 
stimulus-response basis. (A) To build a nest, agents use a set of stochastic rules (pi) defined as the 
151 
association of a particular stimulating configuration and a brick to be deposited. (B) Small 
152 
differences in the execution of rules give rise to important morphological changes of the resulting 
153 
architectures. With the experimentally-measured probabilities, these rules lead to the construction 
154 
of a round shape comb similar to Polistes dominulus nests; with different probability values, 
155 
indented combs are built similar to the nest of Parapolybia varia, a species living in south-east 
156 
Asia.

rebuild new structures from the old ones (C).

Figure 9. The mean lifetime of the building pheromone has a major impact on the resulting shape

evaporation rate (A) or large roofs when lifetime is short corresponding to a strong evaporation 
175 
rate (B).

Figure 10. Growth and remodeling of ant nest architecture. With a large amount of building 
178 
material, ant agents build a laminar structure: roofs are built through the progressive merging of 
179 
the growing capitals and new pillars are built over the successive floors. The cross sections show 
180 
the construction of helicoidal shape connections between successive layers as a consequence of 
181 
the constant digging activity of the ant agents that remodel the whole nest structure.
