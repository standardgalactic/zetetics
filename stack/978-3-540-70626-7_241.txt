Zeeman Effect
Klaus Hentschel
Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943) had been searching for the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds
on spectral lines since 1892. Michael Faraday’s (1791–1867) demonstration of the
rotation of the plane polarization of light in electric ﬁelds had led Faraday himself
and several other experimenters to expect such an inﬂuence. But Zeeman only suc-
ceeded in late 1896, after having installed a strong R¨uhmkorff electromagnet and
a large concave grating, which latter he had obtained personally from its inven-
tor Henry Augustus Rowland (1848–1901). For discovering the effect bearing his
name, Zeeman obtained the Nobel Prize for physics of 1902, together with the the-
oretical physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928), who provided its classical
theoretical interpretation.
Initially, in late October 1896, Zeeman could only observe a diffuse line broad-
ening that had actually been predicted by Joseph Larmor’s (1857–1942)  electron
theory. But in November, Zeeman was able to conﬁrm a prediction by his Leiden
colleague, Lorentz, concerning the polarization of the two fringes. In the spring of
1897, Zeeman ﬁrst recorded distinct splittings of spectral lines into doublets and
triplets. These features became understandable by interpreting the splitting as due
to a precession of  electrons under the inﬂuence of the external magnetic ﬁeld. As
negatively charged particles, electrons have to precess around the axis of a magnetic
ﬁeld H at the so-called Larmor frequency νL = 1/2 e/m H/c. There were three pos-
sibilities: the external magnetic ﬁeld was either (i) parallel or (ii) antiparallel or (iii)
orthogonal to the electron’s axis of precession. All other cases could be explained
as linear  superpositions of these three basic cases. In case (i), the energy of the
electron is increased, in (ii) decreased, and in (iii) unchanged. Hence a splitting into
three components ought to result, and the splitting should be proportional to the
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Even the size of the observed triplet splitting was of
the right order of magnitude, given a speciﬁc charge e/m of the electron of roughly
1.6 · 107 e.m.u. J.J. Thomson had just determined this through electric and magnetic
deviation of  cathode rays and inferred the existence of “corpuscles” in them.
So, this normal Zeeman effect was explained fairly well by classical Larmor–
Lorentz electron theory. In Niels Bohr’s (1885–1962) atomic model, this normal
Zeeman triplet could also be derived. Because of the external magnetic ﬁeld, not
all elliptic orbits of similar eccentricity were energetically equivalent any more.
Depending on the inclination of the electron’s orbit with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld, the energy is slightly increased, decreased or unchanged (for orthogonal
orientation). Space quantization ( Stern–Gerlach experiment) restricts this orbit
inclination to only a few permitted angles, labeled by a new ‘magnetic’  quantum

number m = −1, 0 or +1, thus leading to a splitting into three energy levels. As
Arnold Sommerfeld (1861–1949) showed in 1916, other symmetric splittings into
an odd number of components could be handled similarly, with M = 2J + 1 as the
so-called multiplicity of the normal Zeeman splitting (cf. Fig. 1). Using the  corre-
spondence principle, Bohr’s assistant Hendrik Anthony Kramers (1894–1952) also
tried to derive the relative intensities of the various multiplet components, but agree-
ment with observations was insufﬁcient.
In the winter of 1897/98, Thomas Preston (1860–1900) in Dublin, Alfred Cornu
(1841–1902) in Paris and Albert Michelson (1852–1931) in Chicago, independently
found “anomalous” splittings of spectral lines into quartets, sextets, octets, and
even more complicated patterns. Such splittings, which soon became known as the
anomalous Zeeman effect, remained absolutely mysterious in the classical electron
theory and deeply problematic for  Bohr’s atomic model as well.
It was also unclear why the anomalous Zeeman effect changed over to the normal
effect under very large magnetic ﬁeld strengths, as Friedrich Paschen (1865–1947)
and Ernst Back (1881–1959)found in 1912. Around 1920, Carl Runge (1856–1927)
in G¨ottingen and Alfred Land´e (1888–1976)in T¨ubingen did manage to describe the
complicated anomalous Zeeman patterns phenomenologically. Carl Runge showed
that the splittings ν followed a numerological rule with q1 and q2 integer numbers
smaller than the “Runge denominators” r1 and r2: (see Fig. 2 for an example)
ν = q
r · νL = q1
r1
νL −q2
r2
νL ⇒q
r = q1r2 −q2r1

Land´e introduced the  Land´e g-factors with strange coefﬁcients ∼m(m + 1),
etc., but both of these approaches remained ad hoc. Persistent problems with the
anomalous Zeeman effect substantially contributed to the crisis of  quantum theory

Zero-Point Energy
c.1923 – early 1925. Only after the introduction of the concept of  spin in late 1925
and the development of quantum mechanics could the observed splittings and rela-
tive intensities for the anomalous Zeeman effect be properly derived and physically
understood as the result of gyroscopic forces of the electron’s magnetic moment
μ = −eh/2mc, i.e. one full Bohr magneton and not half a Bohr magneton, as would
be expected from classical electron theory (see [9, pp. 97ff., 108] [6]).

Zero-Point Energy

The concept of zero-point energy ﬁrst appeared in 1912, when Max Planck (1858–
1947) published his “second theory” of  black-body radiation [1]. In this theory the
energy of a harmonic oscillator of frequency ν in thermal equilibrium at temperature
T is equal to
