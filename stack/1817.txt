Eigenforms — Objects as Tokens for
Eigenbehaviors
by Louis H. Kauffman1
This essay is a discussion of Heinz von Foerster's concept of an eigenform, wherein an object is seen
to be a token for those behaviors that lend it (the object) its apparent stability in a changing world.
I. Introduction
This essay is a contemplation of the notion of eigenform as explicated by Heinz von
Foerster in his paper [4]. In that paper Heinz performs the magic trick of convincing
us that the familiar objects of our existence can be seen to be nothing more than tokens
for the behaviors of the organism that create stable forms. This is not to deny an
underlying reality that is the source of these objects, but rather to emphasize the role
of process and the role of the organism in the production of a living map that is so
sensitive that map and territory are conjoined. Von Foerster's papers [4,5,6] in the
book [3] were instrumental in pioneering the ﬁeld of second order cybernetics.
The notion of an eigenform is inextricably linked with second order cybernetics.
One starts on the road to such a concept as soon as one begins to consider a pattern of
patterns, the form of form or the cybernetics of cybernetics. Such concepts appear to
close around upon themselves, and at the same time they lead outward. They suggest
the possibility of transcending the boundaries of a system from a locus that might have
been within the system until the circular concept is called into being, and then the
boundaries have turned inside out. As Ranulph Glanville has pointed out “The inside
is the outside is the inside is the...”
Forms are created from the concatenation of operations upon themselves and
objects are not objects at all, but rather indications of processes. Upon encountering an
object, after that essay of Heinz, you are compelled to ask: How is that object created?
How is it designed? What do I do to produce it? What is the network of productions?
Where is the home of that object? In what context does it exist? How am I involved in
its creation?
Taking Heinz's suggestion to heart we ﬁnd that an object in itself is a symbolic
entity, participating in a network of interactions, taking on its apparent solidity and
stability from these interactions. We ourselves are such objects, we as human beings
are “signs for ourselves,” a concept originally due to the American philosopher C. S.
Peirce [9]. In many ways Heinz's eigenforms are mathematical companions to Peirce's
work. We will not follow this comparison in the present essay, but the reader familiar
with Peirce is encouraged to do so.

Heinz performed a creative act that invites each of us into an unending
epistemological investigation. The key to this act is the stance of an observing system.
In an observing system, what is observed is not distinct from the system itself, nor can
one make a separation between the observer and the observed. These stand together in
a coalescence of perception. From the stance of the observing system all objects are
non-local, depending upon the presence of the system as a whole. It is within that
paradigm that these models begin to live, act and converse with us. We are the models.
Map and territory are conjoined.
In this paper, sections 2 and 3 discuss the nature of object, leading from the
descriptions and assumptions that we use in the everyday world to the somewhat
different concepts of object that occur in scientiﬁc work, particularly in the physics of
the very small. We indicate how the concept of object arising as eigenform (i.e. as
token for the interaction and mutual production of the observer and the observed)
intermediates among these points of view. 
Section 4 gives an exposition of the form of Heinz's model. Once this
mathematical model is on the table, one can discuss how it is related to our concept of
“object.” This section contains examples of fractal and geometric eigenforms.
Section 5 is a recounting of a conversation of the author and Ranulph Glanville in
which Ranulph asked “Does every recursion have a ﬁxed point?” In the language of
the present essay this is the question “Does every process have an eigenform?” The
obvious answer is no, but the answer that comes from Heinz's model is yes! There is
always an ideal eigenform. The challenge is to integrate that form into the context of
one's living. 
In section 6 we point out that the construction of eigenforms in the sense of
Heinz's model can be accomplished without an idealized excursion to inﬁnity. The
method was invented by Alonzo Church and Haskell Curry in the 1930's. This method
is commonly called the “lambda calculus.” The key to lambda calculus is the
construction of a self-reﬂexive language, a language that can refer and operate upon
itself. In this way eigenforms can be woven into the context of languages that are their
own metalanguages, hence into the context of natural language and observing
systems.
In section 7 we consider naming and self-reference and return to Heinz's
deﬁnition of “I.” The concept of section 7 is essentially related to the lambda calculus
where names can act on names and their referents. We discuss how self-reference
occurs in language through an indicative shift welding the name of a person to his/her
(physical) presence and shifting the indication of the name to a metaname. More could
be said at this point, as the indicative shift is a linguistic entry into the world of
Godelian sentences and the incompleteness of formal systems. We emphasize the
natural occurrence of eigenforms in the world of our linguistic experience and how
this occurrence is intimately connected to our structure as observing systems.
Section 8 is an appendix discussing the relationship between eigenforms and the
structure of quantum mechanics. Eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are, in this view,
particular examples of eigenforms. From the world of observing systems, quantum

Eigenforms
73
mechanics is a mathematical articulation of the non-locality and superposition of
forms. This appendix will be unfolded in a sequel to this paper. 
II. Objects 
What is an object? At ﬁrst glance, the question seems perfectly obvious. An object is,
well... An object is a thing, a something that you can pick up and move and manipulate
in three dimensional space. An object is three dimensional, palpable, like an apple or a
chair, or a pencil or a cup. An object is the simplest sort of thing that can be subjected
to reference. All language courses ﬁrst deal with simple objects like pens and tables.
La plume est sur la table. 
An object is separate from me. It is “out there”. It is part of the reality separate
from me. Objects are composed of objects, their parts. My car is made of parts. The
chair is a buzzing whirl of molecules. Each molecule is a whirl of atoms. Each atom a
little solar system of electrons, neutrons and protons. But wait! The nucleus of the
atom is composed of strange objects called quarks. No one can see them. They do not
exist as separate entities. The electrons in the atom are special objects that are not
separate from each other and from everything else. And yet when you observe the
electrons, they have deﬁnite locations.
The physicist's world divides into quantum objects that are subject to the
constraints of the uncertainty principle, and classical objects that live in the dream of
objective existence, carrying all their properties with them. The difference between the
quantum level of objects and the classical level of objects is actually not sharp. From
the point of view of the physicist all phenomena are quantum phenomena, but in
certain ranges, such as the world of the very small, the quantum effects dominate. It is
not the purpose of this essay to detail this correspondence, but a little more
information can be found in section 8.
A classical object has a location at a given time. You can tell where it is. You can
tell a story of where it has been. If the classical object breaks up into parts, you will be
able to keep track of all the parts. Yet electrons and positrons can meet each other and
disappear into pure energy! Should we allow objects to disappear? What sort of an
object is the electromagnetic ﬁeld of radio and television signals that ﬂoods this room? 
Is my thought to be thought of as an object? Can I objectify my thought by writing
it down on paper or in the computer? Am I myself an object? Is my body an object in
the three dimensional space? Is the space itself an object? Objects have shape. What is
the shape of space? What is the shape of the physical universe. What is the shape of
the Platonic universe?
It seemed simple. Then, with more experience, the transformations of pattern that
formed the space and the objects in it began to appear highly interwoven. In the
physical microworld objects, if they were objects at all, did not have many of the
properties of macroscopic objects like heads of cabbage and bowling balls. Give me a
good macroscopic object any day, fully separate and useful. Don't confuse me with
these subatomic fantasies of interconnectedness.

Louis K. Kauffman
If a person (a thought, feeling and symbol object) were to read this section with
the hope of ﬁnding a clear deﬁnition of object, he/she might be disappointed. Yet
Heinz von Foerster in his essays [3,4,5,6] has suggested the enticing notion that
“objects are tokens for eigenbehaviors.” We want to see the meaning of this phrase of
Heinz. The short form of this meaning is that there is a behavior between the perceiver
and the object perceived and a stability or repetition that “arises between them.” It is
this stability that constitutes the object (and the perceiver). In this view, one does not
really have any separate objects, objects are always “objects perceived,” and the
perceiver and the perceived arise together in the condition of observation.
III. Shaping a World
We, identify the world in terms of how we shape it. We shape the world in response to
how it changes us. We change the world and the world changes us. Objects arise as
tokens of that behavior that leads to seemingly unchanging forms. Forms are seen to
be unchanging through their invariance under our attempts to change, to shape them.
Can you conceive of an object independent of your ability to perceive it? I did not
say an object independent of your perception.
Lets assume that it is possible to talk of the tree in the forest where we are not. But
how are we to speak of that tree? One can say, the tree is there. What does this mean?
It means that there is a potentiality for that tree to appear in the event of the
appearance of a person such as myself or yourself in the place called that forest. What
is the tree doing when I am not in the forest?
I will never know, but I do know that “it” obediently becomes treeish and located
when “I” am “there.” The quotation marks are indications of objects dissolving into
relationships. Whenever “I” am present, the world (of everything that is the case) is
seen through the act of framing. I imagine a pure world, unframed. But this is the
world of all possibilities. As soon as we enter the scene the world is ﬁltered and
conformed to become the form that frame and brain have consolidated to say is reality. 
IV. Heinz's Eigenform Model
We have just moved through a discussion showing how the concept of an object has
evolved to make what we call objects (and the objective world) processes that are
interdependent with the actions of observers. The notion of a ﬁxed object has changed
to become a notion of a process that produces the apparent stability of the object. This
process can be simpliﬁed in a model to become a recursive process where a rule or
rules are applied time and time again. The resulting object of such a process is called
by Heinz von Foerster the eigenform of the process, and the process itself is called the
eigenbehavior. 

Eigenforms
75
In this way Heinz created a model for thinking about object as token for
eigenbehavior.   This model examines the result of a simple recursive process carried
to its limit. For example, suppose that:
That is, each step in the process encloses the results of the previous step within a box.
Here is an illustration of the ﬁrst few steps of the process applied to an empty box X: 
If we continue this process, then successive nests of boxes resemble one another, and
in the limit of inﬁnitely many boxes, we ﬁnd that 
the inﬁnite nest of boxes is invariant under the addition of one more surrounding box.
Hence this inﬁnite nest of boxes is a ﬁxed point for the recursion. In other words, if X 
denotes the inﬁnite nest of boxes, then
X = F(X). 
F(X) = 
X
X
F(X)
F(F(X))
F(F(F(X)))
...
X=F(F(F(...)))=
...
F(X) =
= X

76
Louis K. Kauffman
This equation is not meant to denote something arcane! It is a description of a state of
affairs. Place your gaze on the inﬁnite nest of boxes and note that if you add one more
surrounding box, then there is no change to the resulting form. The form of an inﬁnite
nest of boxes is invariant under the operation of adding one more surrounding box.
The inﬁnite nest of boxes is one of the simplest eigenforms.
In the process of observation, we interact with ourselves and with the world to
produce stabilities that become the objects of our perception. These objects, like the
inﬁnite nest of boxes, may go beyond the speciﬁc properties of the world in which we
operate. They attain their stability through this process of going outside the immediate
world. Furthermore, we make an imaginative leap to complete such objects that
become tokens for eigenbehaviors. It is impossible to make an inﬁnite nest of boxes.
We do not make it. We imagine it. And in imagining that inﬁnite next of boxes, we
arrive at the eigenform that is the object for this process. 
The leap of imagination to the inﬁnite eigenform is akin to the human ability to
create signs and symbols. In the case of the eigenform X with X = F(X), X can be
regarded as the name of the process itself or as the name of the limiting (imaginative)
result of the process. Note that if you are told that 
X = F(X)
 
, 
then substituting 
 
F(X)
 
 for 
 
X
 
, you can write
 
X = F(F(X))
 
.
Substituting again and again, you have
 
X = F(F(F(X))) = F(F(F(F(X)))) = F(F(F(F(F(X))))) = ...
The process arises from the symbolic expression of its eigenform.
 
 In this view
the eigenform is a kind of implicate order for the process that generates it. 
Sometimes one stylizes the structure by indicating where the eigenform 
 
X
 
reenters its own indicational space by an arrow or other graphical device. See the
picture below for the case of the nested boxes.

77
Does the inﬁnite nest of boxes exist? Certainly it does not exist in this page or
anywhere in the physical world with which the writer or presumably the reader is
familiar. The inﬁnite nest of boxes exists in the imagination! In that sense it is a
symbolic entity.
The key concept in the understanding of eigenform is its placement in the
reciprocal relationship of the object (the “It”) and the process leading to the object (the
process leading to “It”). In the diagram below we have indicated these relationships
with respect to the eigenform of nested boxes. Note that the “It” is illustrated as a
ﬁnite approximation (to the inﬁnite limit) that is sufﬁcient to allow an observer to
infer/perceive the generating process that underlies it.
Just so, an object in the world (cognitive, physical, ideal,...) provides a conceptual
center for the investigation of a skein of relationships related to its context and to the
processes that generate it. An object can have varying degrees of reality just as does an
eigenform. If we take Heinz's suggestion to heart that objects are tokens for
The It
The Process leading to It.

eigenbehaviors, then an object in itself is a entity, participating in a network of
interactions, taking on its apparent solidity and stability from these interactions. An
object in this view is an amphibian between the symbolic and imaginary world of the
mind and the complex world of personal experience. The object when viewed as
process is a dialogue between these worlds. The object when seen as a sign for itself,
or in and of itself, is as imaginary as a pure eigenform.
Why are objects only apparently solid? Of course you cannot walk through a brick
wall even if you think about it differently. I do not mean apparent in the sense of
thought alone. I mean apparent in the sense of appearance. The wall appears solid to
me because of the actions that I can perform. The wall is quite transparent to a
neutrino, and will not even be an eigenform for that neutrino.
This example shows quite sharply how the nature of an object is entailed in the
properties of its observer.
Heinz's model can be expressed (as indeed he did express it) in quite abstract and
general terms. Suppose that we are given a recursion symbolically by the equation
 
X(t+1) = F(X(t))
 
.
Here 
 
X(t)
 
 denotes the condition of observation at time 
 
t
 
. 
 
X(t)
 
 could be as simple as a
set of nested boxes, or as complex as the entire conﬁguration of your body in relation
to the known universe at time t. Then 
 
F(X(t))
 
 denotes the result of applying the
operations symbolized by 
 
F
 
 to the condition at time 
 
t
 
. You could, for simplicity,
assume that 
 
F
 
 is independent of time. Time independence of the recursion 
 
F 
 
will give
us simple answers and we can later discuss what will happen if the actions depend
upon the time. In the time independent case we can write
 
J = F(F(F(...)))
 
the inﬁnite concatenation of F upon itself. We then see that 
 
F(J) = J
 
since adding one more 
 
F
 
 to the concatenation changes nothing. Thus 
 
J
 
, the inﬁnite
concatenation of the operation upon itself leads to a ﬁxed point for 
 
F
 
. 
 
J
 
 is said to be
the eigenform for the recursion 
 
F
 
. It is just like the nested boxes, and we see that every
recursion has an eigenform. Every recursion has an (imaginary) ﬁxed point.
We end this section with one more example. This is the eigenform of the Koch
fractal [10]. In this case one can write symbolically the eigenform equation
 
K = K { K  K } K
 
to indicate that the Koch Fractal reenters its own indicational space four times (that is,
it is made up of four copies of itself, each one-third the size of the original. The curly

Eigenforms
79
brackets in the center of this equation refer to the fact that the two middle copies
within the fractal are inclined with respect to one another and with respect to the two
outer copies. In the ﬁgure below we show the geometric conﬁguration of the reentry.
In the geometric recursion, each line segment at a given stage is replaced by four line
segments of one third its length, arranged according to the pattern of reentry as shown
in the ﬁgure above. 
The recursion corresponding to the Koch eigenform is illustrated in the next
ﬁgure. Here we see the sequence of approximations leading to the inﬁnite self-
reﬂecting eigenform that is known as the Koch snowﬂake fractal.
Five stages of recursion are shown. To the eye, the last stage vividly illustrates how the
ideal fractal form contains four copies of itself, each one-third the size of the whole.
The abstract schema
 
K = K { K K } K 
K = K { K K } K

80

for this fractal can itself be iterated to produce a “skeleton” of the geometric recursion:
K = K { K K } K 
   = K { K K } K  {  K { K K } K  K { K K } K  } K { K K } K  
   = ...
We have only performed one line of this skeletal recursion. There are sixteen K's
in this second expression just as there are sixteen line segments in the second stage of
the geometric recursion. Comparison with this abstract symbolic recursion shows how
geometry aids the intuition. The interaction of eigenforms with the geometry of
physical, mental, symbolic and spiritual landscapes is an entire subject that is in need
of deep exploration.
It is usually thought that the miracle of recognition of an object arises in some
simple way from the assumed existence of the object and the action of our perceiving
systems. What is to be appreciated is that this is a ﬁne tuning to the point where the
action of the perceiver and the perception of the object are indistinguishable. Such
tuning requires an intermixing of the perceiver and the perceived that goes beyond
description. Yet in the mathematical levels, such as number or fractal pattern, part of
the process is slowed down to the point where we can begin to apprehend the process.
There is a stability in the comparison, in the one-to-one correspondence that is a
process happening at once in the present time. The closed loop of perception occurs in
the eternity of present individual time. Each such process depends upon linked and
ongoing eigenbehaviors and yet is seen as simple by the perceiving mind.
 
V. A Conversation with Ranulph Glanville
 
This essay has its beginnings in a conversation with Ranulph Glanville. Ranulph asked
“Does every recursion have a ﬁxed point?'' hoping for a mathematician's answer. And
I said ﬁrst, “Well no, clearly not, after all it is common for processes to go into
oscillation and so never come to rest.” And then I said, “On the other hand, here is the
 
Theorem: Every recursion has a ﬁxed point.
Proof.
 
 Let the recursion be given by an equation of the form
 
X' = F(X)
 
where
 
 X'
 
 denotes the next value of 
 
X
 
 and 
 
F
 
 encapsulates the function or rule that
brings the recursion to its next step. Here 
 
F
 
 and 
 
X
 
 can be any descriptors of actor and
actant that are relevant to the recursion being studied. Now form 
 
J = F(F(F(F(...))))
 
,

Eigenforms
81
the inﬁnite concatenation of F upon itself. Then we see that 
F(J) = F(F(F(F(F(...))))) = J.
Hence J is a ﬁxed point for the recursion and we have proved that every recursion has
a ﬁxed point.//
Ranulph said “Oh yes I remember that! Can I quote your proof?” and I said
“Certainly, but you will have to make your attribution to Heinz and his paper ‘Objects:
Tokens for (Eigen-)Behaviors’ [4], for that is where I came to appreciate this result,
although I ﬁrst understood it via the book 
 
Laws of Form
 
 [2] by G. Spencer-Brown.”
And I went on to say that this theorem was in my view a startling magician's trick
on Heinz's part, throwing us into the certainty of an eigenform (ﬁxed point)
corresponding to any process and at the same time challenging us to understand the
nature of that ﬁxed point in some context that is actually relevant to the original
ground of conversation. Ranulph agreed, and our emails settled back into the usual
background hum.
 
VI. Church and Curry
 
Alonzo Church and Haskell Curry [1] showed (in the 1930's, long before Heinz wrote
his essays) how to make eigenforms without an apparent excursion to inﬁnity. Their
formalism is usually called the “lambda calculus.” The key concept in their work is the
use of a domain where there is (in a well-deﬁned sense) no distinction between the
language and metalanguage. They use a language that can talk about itself and operate
upon itself. 
In the Church-Curry language (the lambda calculus), there are two basic rules:
Naming and Reﬂexivity.
 
1. Naming. 
If you have an expression in the symbols in lambda calculus then there is always a
single word in the language that encodes this expression
 
. The application of this word
has the same effect as the application of the expression itself. For example, suppose
we consider the expression 
 
“Form the square of a number N and add one.”
 
Then in the lambda calculus there will be a word, lets say it is “
 
Squatch
 
” that has the
same effect as this operation. So “
 
Squatch N
 
” means “square N and add one.” We
have: 
 
Squatch 3 = 3x3 + 1 = 10.

82
Louis K. Kauffman
2. Reﬂexivity. 
Given any two words 
 
A
 
 and 
 
B
 
 in the lambda calculus, there is permission to form their
concatenation 
 
AB
 
, with the interpretation that 
 
A 
 
operates upon or qualiﬁes 
 
B
 
.
 
 In this
way, every word in the lambda calculus is both an operator and an operand. The
calculus is inherently self-reﬂexive. 
We have given an example of reﬂexivity with the equation 
 
Squatch N = NxN + 1
 
.
But lambda calculus will also allow 
 
Squatch Squatch = Squatch x Squatch + 1.
 
 
One then has to ask what it means to multiply Squatch by itself, but the language
allows you to write this equation and then ask the question! 
Here is an example. Let 
 
GA
 
 denote the process that creates two copies of 
 
A
 
 and
puts them in a box.
Then in lambda calculus we are allowed to apply G to itself. The result is two copies
of G next to one another, inside the box.
This equation about GG exhibits GG directly as a solution to the eigenform equation
thus producing the eigenform without an inﬁnite limiting process.
More generally, we wish to ﬁnd the eigenform for a process 
 
F
 
. We want to ﬁnd a 
 
J
 
so that 
 
F(J) = J
 
. Church and Curry admonish us to create an operator 
 
G
 
 with the
property that 
 
GX = F(XX)
 
 
So 
 
GG
 
 is a ﬁxed point for 
 
F
 
. 
We have solved the eigenvalue problem without the customary ritual excursion to
inﬁnity. If you reﬂect on this magic trick of Church and Curry you will see that it has
come directly from the postulates of Naming and Reﬂexivity that we have discussed
AA
GA = 
GG = 
GG
X =
X

Eigenforms
83
above. These notions, that there should be a name for everything, and that words can
be applied to the description and production of other words, allow the language to
refer to itself and to produce itself from itself. The Church-Curry construction was
devised for mathematical logic, but it is fundamental to the logic of logic, the
linguistics of linguistics and the cybernetics of cybernetics. 
I like to call the construction of the intermediate operator 
 
G
 
, the “gremlin” (See
[9].) Gremlins seem innocent enough. They just duplicate entities that they meet, and
set up an operation of the duplicate on the duplicand. But when you let a gremlin meet
a gremlin then strange things can happen. It is a bit like the story of the sorcerer's
apprentice. A recursion may happen whether you like it or not.
A formal eigenform must be placed in a context in order for it to have human
meaning. The struggle on the mathematical side is to control recursions, bending them
to desired ends. The struggle on the human side is to cognize a world sensibly and
communicate well and effectively with others. For each of us, there is a continual
manufacture of eigenforms (tokens for eigenbehavior). Such tokens will not pass as
the currency of communication unless we achieve mutuality as well. One can say that
mutuality itself is a higher eigenform. Achieving mutual understanding will be
recognized. As with all eigenforms, the abstract version exists. Realization happens in
the course of time.
 
VII. The Form of Names
 
The simplicity of a thought, the apparent clarity of distinction is mirrored in the sort of
eigenforms that come from the Church-Curry realm as described in the last section.
Consider a linguistic example: Each person has a name (at least one). In the course of
time we are introduced to people and come to know their names. We know that name
not as an item to look up about the person (and this applies to certain objects as well)
but as a direct property of the person. That is, if I meet Heinz he appears to me as
Heinz, not as this person with certain characteristics, whose name I can ﬁnd in my
social database if I care to do so. It is like this only when we are ﬁrst introduced. At
the point of introduction there is this person and there is his name separate from him.
Once learned, 
 
the name is shifted
 
 and occurs in space right along with the person.
Heinz and his name are in the same cognitive space which is also in the same place as
the apparent physical space. We can observe this shifting process in the course of
learning a name. We can also observe how physical and cognitive spaces are
superimposed. The many classical optical illusions illustrate these matters vividly. 
Now we have Heinz with his name inseparable from his presence, and this is true
even if he is not physically present, for the shift has occurred and will not be undone.
But we also have his name Heinz separate from him, and able to be pinned upon
another. And we have his name not quite separate from him, but rather this Heinz is
the name of the name we have attached to him! This is Heinz's metaname. How do we
distinguish among all these different names for Heinz? We use the same symbols for
them, yet they are different. Lets choose a way to indicate the differences.

84
Louis K. Kauffman
We start with the reference:
Heinz -----> Cybernetic Magician
(The arrow will indicate that the entity on the left is the name of the entity on the right.)
We get to know him and shift the reference.
#Heinz -----> Cybernetic Magician Heinz
Now the name is in the cognitive space of Heinz, and the metaname #Heinz refers to
that conjunction. We shall call this 
 
the indicative shift
 
.
 
name -----> object
#name-----> object name
 
The indicative shift occurs, constantly weaving the apparent external reality with the
linguistic reality. 
 
Self-reference occurs when one calls up (names) the metanaming
operator
 
.
At ﬁrst the metanaming operator is not marked and no name has been chosen for
it. But then its name is chosen (as 
 
#
 
). We have
 
# ----->
 
 
That is, 
 
#
 
 refers at ﬁrst to the singular place where there is an absence of naming, a
void in the realm of distinctions. 
Then the shift occurs. We have the reference of the meta-naming operator to itself
(as the operator enters a space formerly void!).
 
# -----> #
 
Suppose that the meta-naming operator has another name, say M. Then we have
 
M -----> #
 
which shifts to a self-reference at the second articulated level of meta naming
 
#M -----> #M
 
These are the eigenforms of self consciousness in the realm of names.
Heinz said [5]: 
 
“I am the observed link between myself and observing myself.”
 
Self-reference at this level, the action of a domain upon itself, leading to cognition, is
the beginning of the realm of eigenforms in Heinz's world.

VIII. Appendix - Eigenform, Eigenvalue and Quantum Mechanics
There are two reasons for including a discussion of quantum mechanics in this essay.
On the one hand the quantum mechanics of the twentieth century has been a powerful
force in asking us to rethink our notions of objects and causality. On the other hand,
Heinz von Foerster's notion of eigenform is an outgrowth of his background as a
quantum physicist. We should ask what eigenforms might have to do with quantum
theory and with the quantum world.
In this section we meet the concurrence of the view of object as token for
eigenbehavior and the observation postulate of quantum mechanics. In quantum
mechanics observation is modeled not by eigenform but by its mathematical relative
the eigenvector. The reader should recall that a vector is a quantity with magnitude and
direction, often pictured as an arrow in the plane or in three dimensional space.
In quantum physics [11], the state of a physical system is modeled by a vector in a
high-dimensional space, called a Hilbert space. As time goes on the vector rotates in
this high dimensional space. Observable quantities correspond to (linear) operators
 
 H
 
on these vectors 
 
v
 
 that have the property that the application of 
 
H
 
 to 
 
v
 
 results in a new
vector that is a multiple of v by a factor λ. 
(An operator is said to be linear if H(av +w) = aH(v) + H(w) for vectors v and w,
and any number a. Linearity is usually a simplifying assumption in mathematical
models, but it is an essential feature of quantum mechanics.) In symbols this has the
form:
Hv = λv.
One says that v is an eigenvector for the operator H, and that λ is the eigenvalue. The
constant λ is the quantity that is observed (for example the energy of an electron).
These are particular properties of the mathematical context of quantum mechanics.
The λ can be eliminated by replacing H by G = H/λ (when λ is non zero) so that 
Gv = (H/λ)v = (Hv)/λ = λv/k = v.
Thus
Gv = v.

In quantum mechanics observation is founded on the production of eigenvectors  v
with Gv=v where v is a vector in a Hilbert space and G is a linear operator on that
space. 
Many of the strange and fascinating properties of quantum mechanics emanate
directly from this model of observation. In order to observe a quantum state, its vector
is projected into an eigenvector for that particular mode of observation. By projecting
the vector into that mode and not another, one manages to make the observation, but at
the cost of losing information about the other possibilities inherent in the vector. This
is the source, in the mathematical model, of the complementarities that allow exact
determination of the position of a particle at the expense of nearly complete
uncertainty about its momentum (or vice versa the determination of momentum at the
expense of knowledge of the position).
Observation and quantum evolution (the determinate rotation of the state vector in
the high dimensional Hilbert space) are interlocked. Each observation discontinuously
projects the state vector to an eigenvector. The intervals between observations allow
the continuous evolution of the state vector. This tapestry of interaction of the
continuous and the discrete is the basis for the quantum mechanical description of the
world.
Heinz was certainly aware, as a practicing physicist, of this model of observation
in quantum theory. His theory of eigenforms is a sweeping generalization of quantum
mechanics that creates a context for understanding the remarkable effectiveness of
that theory. If indeed the world of objects is, in fact, a world of tokens for
eigenbehaviors, and if physics demands forms of observations that give numerical
results, then a simplest example of such observation is the observable in the quantum
mechanical model. 
This is a reversal of epistemology, a complete turning of the world upside down.
Heinz has tricked us into considering the world of our experience and ﬁnding that it is
our world, generated by our actions and that it has become objective through the self-
generated stabilities of those actions. He has convinced us to come along with him and
see that all of cybernetics conﬁrms this point of view. He has left the corollaries to us.
He has not confronted the physicists and the philosophers head on. He has brought us
into his world and let us participate in the making of it. And he has pointed to the
genesis and tautological nature of quantum theory to those of us who might ask the
question.
But he has also left the consequence of the question to us. For if the world is a
world of eigenforms and most of them are in time oscillatory and unstable, must we
insist on stability at the level of our present perception of that world? In principle,
there is an eigenform, but that form leads always outward into larger worlds and new
understanding. In the case of quantum mechanics, the whole theory has the
appearance of an elementary exercise conﬁrming the view point of objects as tokens
for eigenbehaviors in a special case. Heinz leaves us with the conundrum of ﬁnding
the more general physical theory that conﬁrms that special case.

This dilemma is itself a special case of the dilemma that Heinz has given us. He
said it himself many times. If you give a person an undecidable problem, the action of
that person in attempting to solve the problem reveals the identity of the person and
the nature of his/her creativity
