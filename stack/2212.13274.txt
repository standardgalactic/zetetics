Radio frequency antennas based on Rydberg atoms can in principle reach sensitivities beyond
those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are
needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. This paper presents a detailed theoretical investi-
gation of Rydberg antenna sensitivity, elucidating parameter regimes that could cumulatively lead
to 2–3 orders of magnitude sensitivity increase. Of special interest are three-laser setups proposed
to compensate for atom motion-induced Doppler spreading. Such setups are in indeed shown to
be advantageous, but only because they restore sensitivity to the expected Doppler-limited value,
removing signiﬁcant additional oﬀ-resonance reductions.
Rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a ground state
electron into a very high orbit. The resulting hydrogen-
like atomic state can have (depending on the exact ex-
cited state) an electric dipole moment scaling with prin-
cipal quantum number n as pRy ∼ea0n2 where a0 is
the Bohr radius. For n = O(102) this implies a potential
O(104) increase in the coupling strength of the atom with
an incident external electric ﬁeld Ein(t).
Designing practical devices requires a number of ad-
vances that have been accumulating over the past 30+
years [1–5]. Detection sensitivity actually requires two
nearby Rydberg states with energy diﬀerence close to
the resonance condition ∆ERy = ℏωin where ωin is the
FIG. 1. Example three-laser, ﬁve-state 87Rb Rydberg atom
setup.
In combination, Probe, Dress, and Coupling beams
promote the atom from its ground state |1⟩to a selected
n = 52 Rydberg state |4⟩. An additional vapor cell RF lo-
cal oscillator [10, 11] couples the latter to a second Rydberg
state |5⟩(lower in energy in this case). The incident ﬁeld, with
small frequency diﬀerence |ωin −ωLO| ≪ωLO, is superposed
upon the latter, and through resonant tuning inﬂuences the
Probe beam transmission PEIT. The dominant single photon
decay paths are also shown. The values for this example are
(γ12, γ23, γ34, γ25)/2π = (6606.50, 646.18, 1.64, 1.09) kHz.
incident ﬁeld center frequency, constrained also by the
photon unit angular momentum. The “frequency tuner”
part of the setup hence requires choosing diﬀerent state
pairs to obtain near-resonance.
There are many such
pairs available, enabling unprecedented coverage from
near-DC to to THz regimes [6–8].
The Rydberg state population is maintained by a ﬁnely
tuned laser setup, exciting the atom via a selected se-
quence of transitions. The focus here is the 3-laser setup,
Fig. 1, enabling Doppler control [9], signiﬁcantly extend-
ing a recent 2-laser setup analysis [12].
The combina-
tion of laser, local oscillator (LO) [10, 11], and inci-
dent ﬁeld illumination creates a coherent superposition
of core and Rydberg states.
When resonantly tuned,
this state is highly sensitive to Ein, permitting its read-
out through variation of the Probe beam transmission
PEIT(t) = Pph(t)/P0 where P0 is the laser power and Pph
the power at the photodetector [1–5]. The eﬀect is known
as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The
Rydberg coupling is quantiﬁed by the Rabi frequency
ΩRy(t) = 1
ℏERy(t) · dRy = 1
2[ΩLO + Ωin(t)]
(1)
with (large) transition dipole moment dRy [2] and ERy =
ELO + Ein the total ﬁeld in the narrow band inﬂuencing
the Rydberg transition. The LO multiplier e−iωLOt has
been factored out, and Ωin(t) may then be thought of
as a narrow band communication signal centered on the
(small) frequency diﬀerence ∆ωin = ωin −ωLO [13–15].
We study in this paper the adiabatic linear sensitivity
SEIT deﬁned by
PEIT[ΩRy(t)] = PEIT(ΩLO) + SEIT(ΩLO)Ωin(t)
+ O(|Ωin|2, ∆ωin/ωLO)
(2)
in which we identify SEIT = ∂PEIT/∂ΩLO. As indicated
by the error term, even in the linear regime the sensitiv-
ity degrades for increasingly oﬀ-resonance |∆ωin|. The
rate at which this occurs sets the antenna bandwidth for
the given Rydberg state setting [13–15].
This will be
quantiﬁed in detail elsewhere.
The strong illuminations permit a semiclassical mod-
eling approach in which the E-ﬁeld is treated as classi-

cal, coupling to the atom via the standard Stark term,
while the spontaneous decays are treated statistically [2].
Thus, the full atom–photon ﬁeld problem is replaced by
one involving atom states alone, described by a density
matrix ˆρ, projected here onto the (ﬁve, in this case) illu-
mination driven states. The equation of motion
∂tˆρ = i[ˆρ, ˆH] + ˆD[ˆρ]
(3)
(setting ℏ= 1) includes both unitary evolution via the
Stark Hamiltonian ˆH, and nonunitary relaxation via the

Due to the tree-like structure seen in Fig. 1, in which
there are no closed excitation loops (e.g., no additional
laser directly coupling states |3⟩, |5⟩or |2⟩, |4⟩) one
may consistently transform to a “rotating” frame in
which all driving frequencies are absorbed into the states:
|n⟩→ei(εn+∆n)t|n⟩and ρmn →ei(εm−εn+∆m−∆n)tρmn,
where εn are the bare atom energy levels and ∆n =
εn −εm −ωmn is the detuning of the illumination cou-

in which ∆2 = ∆P , ∆3 = ∆P +∆D, ∆4 = ∆P +∆D+∆C,
∆5 = ∆P +∆D+∆C+∆LO. The lines emphasize the core
and Rydberg subspaces. For atom velocity v, the energy
levels are Doppler shifted relative to the stationary illu-
minators, with resulting detuning shifts ∆α →∆α+kα·v
where kα is the wavevector of illuminator α. Note that
even as v/λLO is at least O(104) smaller than the laser
values, ELO(x) will also not be plane-wave like, being
strongly inﬂuenced by the vapor cell geometry.
The
Doppler shift of ∆LO will hence be neglected.
Since the (3) is linear in ˆρ, by listing its elements as a
column vector ρ, one obtains
∂tρ = Gρ,
G = iH + D
(5)
with commutator matrix Hmn,pq = Hqnδpm −Hmpδqn
and elements of D similarly determined by the decay
rates. The steady state, or adiabatic, density matrix ρad
therefore satisﬁes Gρad = 0. Existence of a nonempty
kernel follows from conservation of probability, P · ρ ≡
tr[ˆρ] = 1, translating to PT G = 0, guaranteeing reduced
rank of G. The sensitivity derivative, as seen below, will
involve the same derivative ∂ρ/∂ΩLO. One obtains

velocity is vth =
p
kBT/m = 169 m/s. For λ = 1 µm
this leads to Doppler shifts vth/λ ≃170 MHz, enormous
compared to the ∼1 MHz, or less, resonant linewidths
encountered below. A naive estimate is hence that fewer
than 1% and 0.01% of atoms, that happen to be moving
slowly, will contribute to Sth
EIT for 1D and 2D setups, re-
spectively. In fact, it is generally much worse than this.
It will be seen that the v dependence causes diﬀerent
atom populations to give opposite-sign, near-canceling
contributions to Sth
EIT unless one enforces the condition
P
α kα = 0. The latter does not lead to true Doppler
compensation (e.g., eﬀectively smaller T), it simply re-
stores the above naive Doppler-reduced estimate.

with cell length L, αP = 2kP N0|d12|2/ϵ0ℏ, and atomic
number density N0. This is a linear response result, fail-
ing for large |ΩP | (hence competing with the desire to
increase photon count); ΩP /2π < 3 MHz is found to
be a reasonable experimental compromise.
Note that
Re[ρth
21] corresponds to an index of refraction, perhaps
detectable via an alternative interference measurement.
Note also that absorption is a consequence of decay pro-
cesses: Im[ˆρth] is nonzero only due to the presence of
ˆD[ˆρth], mainly through the relatively large value γ12.
Spectral properties of ˆH dominate the resonant behavior,
but ˆD[ˆρth] generates the EIT signal.
If one assumes that only ΩP varies along the beam,
then (8) is computed by solving the ODE pair

with all other parameters taken as ﬁxed. The two density
matrix derivatives are computed via (6). Depending on
setup details, these could be extended to treat simulta-
neous inhomogeneity of the remaining Ωα, generated by
exponentials of other components of ˆρth.
For L ≲1 cm we ﬁnd that ΩP ≃ΩP (0) may be
taken as uniform, yielding the simpliﬁcation RP (L) =

For numerical simplicity, most examples below will use
this limit. At the end we consider solutions of (9) for
larger L, addressing questions of optimal cell length.
The ﬁrst (1D setup) Doppler eﬀect demonstration is
shown in Fig. 2. The maximum sensitivity Sth
EIT ∼10−3
(Mrad/s)−1, indeed about 1% of the T = 0 value (not
shown), occurs very close to (kC/kP )Dopp ≡1−kD/kP =
−0.00549, and drops by O(102) at the physical value
kC/kP = 0.6197 in Fig. 1. Since kC cannot physically
be varied without strongly varying ∆C, this result is ar-
tiﬁcial, but is next conﬁrmed for the physically consistent

limitation on the linear response regime. The negative Sth

values at ΩLO/2π = 0.85 MHz seen in Fig. 3 reach a local min-
imum at ΩLO/2π ∼0.4 MHz, reverse sign at ΩLO/2π ∼0.1
MHz as seen here, then grow to much larger positive values.
The enhancement with increasing ΩD seen in Fig. 3 is pre-
served. Inset: Star conﬁguration (kα units of rad/nm).
2D “star” conﬁguration kP +kD +kC = 0 (Fig. 5 inset).
Figure 3 shows the eﬀect of perturbation of the angle θC
of kC for various ΩD. The sensitivity magnitude in all
cases drops by O(10) on ∼1◦scales, corresponding to
∼1 MHz shift in the detuning ∆C. The O(10−4) peak
sensitivity value for ΩD/2π = 3.9 MHz is consistent with
the naive estimate above. The increase with ΩD (and
with ΩC, but not shown) occurs because increasing the
oﬀ-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian (4) reduces
the inﬂuence of the Doppler-dominated diagonal com-
ponents. The eﬀect saturates above ΩD/2π ∼30 MHz
because the increasing velocities involved are suppressed
by the Maxwell distribution (7).
Insight into these eﬀects is obtained from the under-
lying 1D and 2D “velocity spectra” shown, respectively,
in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 and in Fig. 4. Diﬀerent
atom populations clearly contribute very diﬀerently. For
example, for the 2D case with θC = θDopp
C
, the station-
ary atom value SEIT(v = 0) ≃0.05 is actually domi-
nated by neighboring large negative sensitivity regions
SEIT(v) ∼−0.3. In both 1D and 2D cases, away from
the Doppler point, the scale of variation with v is un-
changed, but the geometry of the positive and negative
regions changes dramatically, with Sth
EIT →0 through a
combination of cancellation between regions and shrink-
ing of the near-resonant region.
Note that even as the 1D conﬁguration has a built in
O(10−2) Doppler disadvantage, it is simpler to set up
and has geometric advantages, such as larger L and con-
veniently overlapping laser beams, that have made it the
dominant experimental focus. The active vapor volume
could then be increased to gain a factor of O(10) over the
result in Fig. 2. Similar 2D setup gains the would require

as not to stray too far out of the estimated linear response

greatly broadening the ∼1 mm2 intersecting beams.
Figure 5 shows an exploration of the very small LO
amplitude limit (now limited to θC = θDopp
C
). For van-
ishing ∆α used here, symmetry dictates that P th
EIT be
even, hence Sth
EIT →0 for ΩLO →0. Indeed, a negative
maximum is found for ΩLO/2π ∼0.4 MHz, but push-
ing to lower ΩLO yields the surprising result that SEIT
changes sign at ΩLO/2π ∼0.1 MHz, then grows to an
O(102) times larger positive maximum at ΩLO/2π ∼10
kHz, before ﬁnally turning around to vanish. This max-
imum also grows roughly linearly with ΩD.
Finally we return to consider inhomogeneous probe
beams.
Figure 6 shows exact and approximate sensi-
tivity results vs. input power and cell length. The dif-
ferences are not huge, but for given ΩP (0) the two can
give very diﬀerent predictions for the maximum sensitiv-
ity point, highlighted here for ΩP (0)/2π = 2.7 MHz. In
either case, one can more than double the sensitivity by
going to considerably longer than L = 1 cm. Of course
there are practical issues that may make this diﬃcult.
We have explored here several avenues for increasing
Rydberg antenna sensitivity using 2D “Doppler aware”
setups.
The highlight, perhaps, is demonstration of
an O(102) boost from Sth
EIT ∼10−3 (upper curve of
Fig. 3, representing “typical” experimental setups) to
∼10−1 (upper curve of Fig. 5, optimally small ΩLO,

5
large ΩD).
There are a number of extensions of the
theory, relevant to applications, that will be presented
elsewhere: measurement noise considerations (e.g., pho-
ton shot noise replaces SEIT by the signal-to-noise ratio
measure SNR = ΩP Sth
EIT/
q
P th
EIT); non-adiabatic eﬀects
and accompanying signal bandwidth limitations; as well
as other forms of signal distortion including nonlinear re-
sponse. The ﬁve-state projection (4) also deserves more
careful consideration. Inﬂuence of additional nearby but
nonresonant states is unlikely to change the basic con-
clusions, but could inﬂuence detailed line shapes in the
high resolution limits of interest here.
