Self-Adjoint Operator
Werner Stulpe
Self-adjoint operator, a sharpening of the concept of a symmetric operator. A linear
 operator A acting in a complex  Hilbert space H and deﬁned on a dense linear
submanifold DA is called symmetric or Hermitian if ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aφ|ψ⟩for all
φ, ψ ∈DA. A densely deﬁned operator in H is symmetric if and only if the scalar
products ⟨φ|Aφ⟩, φ ∈DA, are real.
The adjoint A∗of a densely deﬁned linear operator A is deﬁned as follows. The
domain DA∗of A∗consists of all vectors φ ∈H for which there exists a vector
χφ ∈H such that ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨χφ|ψ⟩for all ψ ∈DA; since DA is dense in H, χφ is
uniquely determined, and A∗φ = χφ concludes the deﬁnition of A∗. In particular,
⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨A∗φ|ψ⟩for all ψ ∈DA and all φ ∈DA∗. The adjoint is a closed
( operator) linear operator, but the submanifold DA∗need not be dense in H; DA∗
is dense in H if and only if A is closable in which case A = A∗∗(by deﬁnition,
A∗∗= (A∗)∗). A densely deﬁned linear operator A is called self-adjoint if A = A∗,
i.e., ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aφ|ψ⟩for all φ, ψ ∈DA = DA∗.
A densely deﬁned linear operator is symmetric if and only if A∗is an extension of
A (brieﬂy written as A ⊆A∗), that is, A∗coincides with A on DA, but possibly has
a larger domain. It can be shown that a symmetric operator satisﬁes A ⊆A∗∗⊆A∗
where A∗∗is the closure ( operator) of A. Thus, for a closed symmetric opera-
tor, A = A∗∗⊆A∗holds true, and for a self-adjoint operator, A = A∗∗= A∗.
A symmetric operator is called essentially self-adjoint if its closure A = A∗∗is
self-adjoint; an essentially self-adjoint operator satisﬁes A ⊆A∗∗= A∗. A nec-
essary and sufﬁcient criterion for the self-adjointness of a symmetric operator A is
that RA+iI = RA−iI = H, where I is the unit operator and RA+iI, for instance,
the range of the operator A + iI which is deﬁned on DA; a criterion for the es-
sential self-adjointness of A is that RA+iI and RA−iI are dense in H.—For a linear
operator with domain DA = H the concepts of symmetry and self-adjointness are
equivalent; a symmetric or self-adjoint operator deﬁned on H is necessarily bounded
( operator).

Self-Adjoint Operator

S
An (unbounded) symmetric operator need not have a self-adjoint extension; if
a self-adjoint extension exists, it is in general not unique. A symmetric operator A
has exactly one self-adjoint extension if and only if A is essentially self-adjoint.
Self-adjointness is a crucial property of an operator since only self-adjoint opera-
tors always have a spectral decomposition as pointed out below. The Hamiltonian
operators of quantum mechanics ( Hamiltonian operator) are often given as essen-
tially self-adjoint differential expressions.
(Spectral decomposition, see  Density operator; Ignorance interpretation; Mea-
surement theory; Objectiﬁcation; Operator; Probabilistic Interpretation; Propensi-
ties in Quantum Mechanics; Wave Mechanics).
As an example, let the simple differential operator P0 = −i d
dx be deﬁned
on DP0 = {ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx) | ψ absolutely continuous, ψ′ ∈L2([a, b], dx),
ψ(a) = ψ(b) = 0} (absolutely continuous functions are in particular differentiable
almost everywhere). The domain DP0 is a dense submanifold of L2([a, b], dx) and
can alternatively be characterized according to DP0 = {ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx) | ∂ψ ∈
L2([a, b], dx), ψ(a) = ψ(b) = 0} where ∂ψ is the derivative of ψ in the sense of
distributions; the linear operator P0 in L2([a, b], dx) is unbounded and closed. By
integration by parts, P0 is symmetric. The adjoint P ∗
0 is again given by P ∗
0 = −i d
dx ,
but on the domain DP ∗
0 = {ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx) | ∂ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx)} which is
larger than DP0; P ∗
0 is also closed, but not symmetric. So P0 is not self-adjoint;
nevertheless, P0 has inﬁnitely many self-adjoint extensions, namely, Pα = −i d
dx on
DPα = {ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx) | ∂ψ ∈L2([a, b], dx), ψ(a) = eiαψ(b), α ∈R}.
The multiplication operator Q0 on DQ0 = L2([a, b], dx) deﬁned by (Q0ψ)(x)
= xψ(x) is bounded and self-adjoint where ∥Q0∥= max{|a|, |b|}. The multi-
plication operator Q in L2(R, dx), deﬁned on DQ = {ψ ∈L2(R, dx) | idRψ ∈
L2(R, dx)} by Qψ = idRψ, i.e., by (Qψ)(x) = xψ(x), is unbounded and self-
adjoint. The differential operator P = −i d
dx in L2(R, dx), deﬁned on DP ={ψ ∈
L2(R, dx) | ∂ψ ∈L2(R, dx)}, is also unbounded and self-adjoint. The same holds
for the Laplace operator H0 = − = −

in L2(R3, dx), de-
ﬁned on DH0 = {ψ ∈L2(R3, dx) | ∂iψ, ∂i∂jψ ∈L2(R3, dx), i, j = 1, 2, 3}. As a
ﬁnal example, the Schr¨odinger operator
◦
H = −+V (x) = −+V (x1, x2, x3) in
L2(R3, dx) where V is a suitable real-valued function, can be deﬁned on the dense
linear submanifold C∞
0 (R3) (consisting of the inﬁnitely differentiable complex-
valued functions on R3 with compact support); under relatively general conditions
on the function V ,
◦
H is essentially self-adjoint, its self-adjoint extension H has the
domain DH = DH0, and the spectrum (see the fourth of the following paragraphs)
of H is bounded from below.
In the sequel, let H be a separable  Hilbert space; for a nonseparable Hilbert
space some of the following statements must slightly be modiﬁed. The eigenvalues
( operator) of a symmetric or self-adjoint operator, if there are any, are real, there
are at most countably many ones, and the corresponding eigenspaces are orthogo-
nal ( Hilbert space) to each other; in general, such an operator does not have a

694
Self-Adjoint Operator
complete orthonormal system of eigenvectors. A compact ( operator) self-adjoint
operator A does have countably many eigenvalues with 0 as only possible accumu-
lation point. Each nonzero eigenvalue is of ﬁnite multiplicity, i.e., the corresponding
eigenspace is ﬁnite-dimensional. The eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal, more-
over, A has a complete orthonormal system of eigenvectors which is obtained
by choosing an  orthonormal basis in each eigenspace and joining these bases.
Correspondingly, a compact self-adjoint operator has the spectral decomposition
A = ∞
i=1 λiPφi where λ1, λ2, . . . are the nonzero eigenvalues of A, counted ac-
cording to their multiplicity and arranged according to |λ1| ⩾|λ1| ⩾. . . > 0,
φ1, φ2, . . . is an orthonormal system of corresponding eigenvectors, Pφi = |φi⟩⟨φi|
are the corresponding one-dimensional orthogonal projections ( projection), and
the sum converges in the operator norm ( operator) or is ﬁnite (in the latter
case, 0 must be an eigenvalue of inﬁnite multiplicity, provided that H is inﬁnite-
dimensional).
A bounded self-adjoint operator need not have any eigenvalue. Instead, every
bounded or unbounded self-adjoint operator has a spectral decomposition. A spec-
tral measure E is a mapping that assigns an orthogonal  projection E(B) to
each Borel set B of the real line R such that (i) E(∅) = 0, E(R) = I and (ii)

φ = ∞
i=1 E(Bi)φ for every sequence of mutually disjoint Borel sets
B1, B2, . . . and all φ ∈H; as a consequence, the projections E(Bi) are orthogo-
nal to each other. Furthermore, the mapping associating each Borel set B with the
number ⟨ψ|E(B)ψ⟩is a probability measure if ψ ∈H is a unit vector. The spectral
theorem for self-adjoint operators now states that there is a one-one correspondence
between the self-adjoint operators A in H and the spectral measures such that (i)
DA =

ψ ∈H
 
R λ2 ⟨ψ|E(dλ)ψ⟩< ∞
;
and (ii) ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩=

R λ ⟨ψ|E(dλ)ψ⟩
for all ψ ∈DA; the self-adjoint operator is uniquely determined by the scalar
products ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩, ψ ∈DA. The representation (ii) of A is called its spectral
decomposition.
The concept of spectral measure is closely related to the concept of spectral fam-
ily. A spectral family F is a function assigning an orthogonal projection F(λ) to
each real number λ such that (i) F(λ) ⩽F(μ) for λ ⩽μ, (ii) limλ→∞F(λ)φ = φ
and limλ→−∞F(λ)φ = 0 for all φ ∈H, and (iii) limϵ→0 F(λ + ϵ)φ = F(λ)φ for
all λ ∈R and all φ ∈H; the function associating each real number λ with the num-
ber ⟨ψ|F(λ)ψ⟩is a cumulative distribution function if ψ is a unit vector. A spectral
measure E deﬁnes a spectral family according to F(λ) = E((−∞, λ]), conversely,
there exists exactly one spectral measure such that E((λ, μ]) = F(μ) −F(λ).
Using the spectral family corresponding to the spectral measure of a self-adjoint op-
erator, the integrals in the spectral theorem can be considered as Riemann–Stieltjes
integrals, e.g., ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩=

 ∞
−∞λ d⟨ψ|F(λ)ψ⟩.
The spectrum σA of a self-adjoint operator A is a subset of R that can be charac-
terized by the spectral measure E of A or by the corresponding spectral family F.
A real number λ belongs to the spectrum of A if and only if, for every ϵ > 0,
E((λ −ϵ, λ + ϵ)) ̸= 0 (equivalently, λ is a point of increase of F). A real number
is an eigenvalue of A if and only if E({λ}) ̸= 0 (equivalently, F is discontinuous
at λ in the sense that limϵ→0 F(λ −ϵ)φ ̸= F(λ)φ for some φ ∈H); λ is a point

of the spectrum that is not an eigenvalue if and only if E((λ −ϵ, λ + ϵ)) ̸= 0 for
every ϵ > 0 and E({λ}) = 0 (equivalently, λ is a point of increase of F and F is
continuous at λ). Finally, λ is not a point of the spectrum if and only if there exists
an ϵ > 0 such that E((λ −ϵ, λ + ϵ)) = 0 (equivalently, λ is a point of constancy of
F). The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator is a closed subset of the real line and for
bounded self-adjoint operators a compact set.
For a self-adjoint operator A with spectral measure E and for a complex-valued
Borel-measurable function f on the real line, a closed operator f (A) can be deﬁned
by (i) Df (A) =
:
ψ ∈H
 
R |f (λ)|2 ⟨ψ|E(dλ)ψ⟩< ∞
;
and (ii) ⟨ψ|f (A)ψ⟩=

R f (λ) ⟨ψ|E(dλ)ψ⟩where Df (A) is dense in H. The association of the functions
f and the operators A with the operators f (A) is called the functional calculus
of the self-adjoint operators. If f is real-valued, then f (A) is self-adjoint, and the
spectral measure of f (A) is given by Ef (A)(B) = E(f −1(B)) where f −1(B) =
{λ ∈R | f (λ) ∈B}. If is f bounded, f (A) is bounded. If A is bounded, the set of all
operators f (A) where f is a continuous complex-valued function, is the C∗-algebra
generated by A, i.e., the smallest C∗-algebra containing A; this C∗-algebra is a
commutative C∗-algebra of (bounded) operators. The continuous functions f need
not be bounded since, in the deﬁnition of f (A), it is sufﬁcient to integrate over the
spectrum of A which is compact if A is bounded. If A is a bounded self-adjoint
operator, the set of all f (A) where f is a bounded measurable function, is the von
Neumann algebra generated by A ( algebraic quantum mechanics).
Another version of the spectral theorem states that every self-adjoint operator
is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator acting in some Hilbert space
of square-integrable functions or in a direct sum of such Hilbert spaces. A vector
χ ∈H is called a cyclic vector for A, A being a self-adjoint operator, if the sub-
manifold generated by the vectors E(B)χ where B is a Borel set of R and E the
spectral measure of A, is dense in H. Let A be a self-adjoint operator with a cyclic
vector χ (which need not exist in general), and let μχ be the measure deﬁned on
the Borel sets of R by μχ(B) = ⟨χ|E(B)χ⟩. Then there exists a  unitary operator
U from H onto the Hilbert space L2(R, μχ) of the μχ-quadratically integrable
functions such that (i) DA =
:
ψ ∈H
 
R λ2|(Uψ)(λ)|2 μχ(dλ) < ∞
;
and (ii)
(UAU−1φ)(λ) = λφ(λ) where φ = Uψ for some ψ ∈DA. The realization of A
as a multiplication operator in L2(R, μχ) is not unique (since the cyclic vector χ
is not unique) and is called a spectral representation of A. If the ﬁnite measure μχ
is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure dλ, i.e., if μχ and dλ have the same sets of
measure zero, then A can be represented as a multiplication operator in the Hilbert
space L2(R, dλ) of the Lebesgue-quadratically integrable functions. For a self-
adjoint operator A with no cyclic vector, there is also a spectral representation. In
this case there exist countably many vectors χ1, χ2, . . . ∈H and a unitary operator
U from H onto the direct sum L2(R, μχ1) ⊕L2(R, μχ2) ⊕. . . such that UAU−1
is again a multiplication operator, i.e., (UAU−1φ)(λ) = λφ(λ) where φ = Uψ is
an element of the direct sum and ψ ∈DA.
As an example, let A be a (bounded or unbounded) self-adjoint operator in H
with a spectrum consisting entirely of eigenvalues; equivalently, A has a complete
orthonormal system of eigenvectors. Let λi be the eigenvalues and Pi the orthogonal

projections onto the corresponding eigenspaces. Then the spectral measure EA of
A is given by EA(B)φ = 
{i|λi∈B} Piφ, B being a Borel set of R and φ ∈H,
and the spectral decomposition reads Aψ = 
i λiPiψ, ψ ∈DA. The self-adjoint
differential operators Pα mentioned above are of the type of the operator A. As
another example, the spectral measure EQ of the self-adjoint operator Q introduced
above is given by EQ(B)φ = χBφ where χB(x) = 1 for x ∈B, χB(x) = 0 for
x ̸∈B, and φ ∈L2(R, dx); the spectrum σQ of Q is R. The spectral measure
of the operator Q0 reads EQ0(B)φ = χB∩[a,b]φ where φ ∈L2([a, b], dx); σQ0 =
[a, b]. Finally, the differential operator P is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication
operator Q, more precisely, P = F −1QF and DP = {ψ ∈L2(R, dx) | ψ =
F −1φ, φ ∈DQ} where F is the  unitary operator of the Fourier transform, so
EP (B) = F −1EQ(B)F and σP = R. Furthermore, FPF −1 = Q is an instance of
the general statement of the preceding paragraph.
The spectral representation of a self-adjoint operator A can be related to a gener-
alized eigenvector problem of A encompassing the so-called improper eigenvalues
and eigenvectors. For a rigorous treatment of quantum mechanics, the concept of
improper eigenvalues and eigenvectors is not necessary; however, for calculational
purposes it is sometimes useful to work with this concept which is mostly done in a
formal, heuristic manner. For instance, if A has no proper eigenvalues, the points λ
of the spectrum of A are improper eigenvalues where the improper eigenvectors φλ,
Aφλ = λφλ, are not elements of the Hilbert space H. Moreover, there exists a com-
plete orthonormal system of improper eigenvectors. If, in addition, A has a cyclic
vector χ ∈H and the measure μχ deﬁned above is absolutely continuous w.r.t. the
Lebesgue measure, then the improper eigenvalues are of multiplicity 1, a complete
orthonormal system of improper eigenvectors φλ satisﬁes ⟨φλ|φμ⟩= δ(λ−μ), δ be-
ing the δ-distribution, and every vector ψ ∈H can be written as ψ = 
σA α(λ)φλ dλ
where σA is the spectrum of A and α(λ) = ⟨φλ|ψ⟩, α ∈L2(σA, dλ).—A sound
mathematical basis for the concept of improper eigenvalues and eigenvectors is pre-
sented in [8]; beyond that, the improper eigenvectors can, under some conditions
on A, be interpreted as eigenfunctionals in the context of the so-called Gelfand
triples [9].
If A is a self-adjoint or only symmetric operator and if φ1, φ2, . . . is a complete
orthonormal system in H that belongs to the domain DA, then the statement ψ =
Aχ, χ ∈DA, can be expressed by the matrix representation ( operator) βi =

j aijαj, i = 1, 2, . . ., where αj = ⟨φj|χ⟩, βi = ⟨φi|ψ⟩, and aij = ⟨φi|Aφj⟩. The
matrix elements satisfy aij = aji, i.e., they form a Hermitian matrix.

Semi-classical Models
Markus Arndt
The Notion of Semi-classicality
Within the literature on quantum physics the word “semi-classical” is used both very
often and with different meanings. But three situations are most commonly encoun-
tered: Firstly, quantum systems that are approximated by classical models at high
 quantum numbers. Secondly, the mathematical description of composite systems
which can be simpliﬁed by dividing the problem into a classical and a quantum
sector. And ﬁnally, open quantum systems which reveal classical properties in their
interaction with a complex environment.
The various deﬁnitions of semi-classicality apply to a vast range of physical
systems, covering quantum optics [1], atomic physics [2], molecular physics [3],
mesoscopic and solid state physics [4] or even  quantum gravity [5]. A recent
and comprehensive resource letter by Gutzwiller [6] provides nearly four hundred
commented references to important papers on that subject. And a number of these
papers have been collected and reprinted in [7].
Systems at High Quantum Numbers
It has been proven in countless experiments, that quantum physics is the correct
theory for describing the world of elementary particles, atoms and molecules. It
is also widely believed, that quantum theory is equally correct in the macroscopic
world. However, in many cases the use of classical models is simpler and already
fully sufﬁcient for the description of observed phenomena. This is why Niels Bohr
suggested the  correspondence principle, which should connect the two worlds in
the limit of sufﬁciently high quantum numbers [8]. In this sense, quantum theory
should become “semi-classical”.
A good example for this is the hydrogen atom: When Bohr built his ﬁrst atom
model  Bohr’s atom model [8], aiming at the quantitative understanding of atomic
