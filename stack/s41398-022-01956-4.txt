While there is substantial evidence that cannabis use is associated with differences in human brain development, most of this
evidence is correlational in nature. Bayesian causal network (BCN) modeling attempts to identify probable causal relationships in
correlational data using conditional probabilities to estimate directional associations between a set of interrelated variables. In this
study, we employed BCN modeling in 637 adolescents from the IMAGEN study who were cannabis naïve at age 14 to provide
evidence that the accelerated prefrontal cortical thinning found previously in adolescent cannabis users by Albaugh et al. [1] is a
result of cannabis use causally affecting neurodevelopment. BCNs incorporated data on cannabis use, prefrontal cortical thickness,
and other factors related to both brain development and cannabis use, including demographics, psychopathology, childhood
adversity, and other substance use. All BCN algorithms strongly suggested a directional relationship from adolescent cannabis use
to accelerated cortical thinning. While BCN modeling alone does not prove a causal relationship, these results are consistent with a
body of animal and human research suggesting that adolescent cannabis use adversely affects brain development.

INTRODUCTION
There is substantial evidence that adolescent cannabis use is
associated
with
poorer
cognitive
function
[2],
as
well
as
differences in brain structure and function [3]. However, evidence
is mixed as to whether the cognitive and neurobiological
differences identiﬁed are caused by adolescent cannabis use or
are pre-existing and might dispose individuals to be more likely to
initiate cannabis use. Research in humans suggests that long-term
differences in prefrontal morphometry in adolescents using
cannabis are most pronounced in regions of the brain that show

the highest levels of expression for the cannabinoid receptor 1
gene (CNR1) [4]. Additionally, animal research has shown that THC
exposure in adolescent rats alters the morphological trajectory of
pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex [5]. However, adult and
older adolescent twin studies have found comparable cognitive
function in monozygotic twins discordant for cannabis use,
though these studies have not investigated brain structure or
function [6, 7].
A recent paper by Albaugh et al. [1] found that, in a sample of
799 adolescents, initiation of cannabis use between the ages of 14
and 19 was associated with a higher rate of cortical thinning
during that period. In that study, there were no differences in
cortical thickness among the groups at age 14 and the subsequent
cortical thinning was associated with amount of cannabis used
from 14 to 19 in a dose-dependent pattern. It also found that
regions demonstrating cannabis-related cortical thinning had, on
average, greater availability of CB1 receptors (as assessed by
Positron Emission Tomography in a separate sample of young
adults),
suggesting
that
the
accelerated
thinning
may
be
mediated, in part, by cannabis exposure affecting the brain’s
endogenous cannabinoid system. That said, it remains possible
that these brain changes may not be a consequence of the
cannabis exposure but may reﬂect instead a neurodevelopmental
trajectory caused by other factors that is related to a higher
likelihood of adolescent cannabis use.
Cortical thinning in adolescence is well-established as a normal
trajectory of brain development. Studies estimate cortical thinning
of around 1% annually, which comes out to around 0.03–0.06
millimeters per year [8–11]. There is also work showing that
negative early life experiences are associated with premature
thinning in adolescence [12], which is, in turn, associated with
negative outcomes, including greater likelihood of attention-
deﬁcit/hyperactivity symptoms [13] and symptoms of depression
[14]. Likewise, Albaugh et al. found an association between
accelerated cortical thinning and attentional impulsivity, particu-
larly in the DPFC region identiﬁed as being related to cannabis use
[1]. In total, this literature suggests that accelerated prefrontal
thinning resulting from cannabis use is likely to be a negative
prognostic factor for mental health outcomes.
Bayesian causal network (BCN) modeling is a method for
estimating
the
directional
relationships
between
a
set
of
differentially related variables [15]. This approach models the
relationships among variables as a directed acyclic graph using
the conditional dependencies among variables. The structure of a
BCN
can be
estimated
through
use
of
structure
learning
algorithms. These algorithms apply an emerging understanding
of how directional relationships are predicated on conditional
dependence to determine the BCN that best represents the joint
probability distributions of a dataset [16]. Assuming that there are
no hidden variables unaccounted for, these networks can be
interpreted as implying causal relationships [17]. This approach
has recently been used to test the direction of effect between
binge drinking and prefrontal and temporal gray matter devel-
opment, ﬁnding that atypical gray matter development appeared
to be increasing the likelihood of binge drinking rather than binge
drinking producing cortical atrophy [18].
The current study used the same BCN modeling approach as
Robert et al. [18] with the same IMAGEN data used in Albaugh
et al. [1], to assess whether initiation of cannabis use and changing
cortical thickness across adolescence are causally related. We did
this by including all variables in the analyses of Albaugh et al., as
well as several other potential confounders as variables in a BCN.
Specially, in our BCN models we included genetic factors putting
individuals at risk for cannabis use, demographic factors, life
history, psychopathology, and other substance use. Inclusion of
this large set of variables was ideal for the analytic strategy
planned, as BCN learning algorithms operate best on many
interrelated variables, which allows them to determine the
conditional dependencies among them.
METHODS
Participants and procedures
Participants were drawn from the IMAGEN study conducted across eight
European sites. Local ethics research committees approved the study at
each site (London, England: Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery Research
Ethics Subcommittee, Waterloo Campus, King’s College London; Notting-
ham, England: University of Nottingham Medical School Ethics Committee;
Mannheim, Germany: Medizinische Fakultaet Mannheim, Ruprecht Karl
Universitaet Heidelberg and Ethik-Kommission II an der Fakultaet fuer
Kliniksche Medizin Mannheim; Dresden, Germany: Ethikkommission der
Medizinischen Fakultaet Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden Medizinische
Fakultaet; Hamburg, Germany: Ethics Board, Hamburg Chamber of
Physicians; Paris, France: CPP IDF VII (Comité de protection des personnes
Ile de France), ID RCB: 2007-A00778-45 September 24, 2007; Dublin,
Ireland: TCD School of Psychology REC; and Berlin, Germany: Ethics
Committee of the Faculty of Psychology). Written consent was obtained
from the adolescent’s parent or guardian, and verbal assent was obtained
from the adolescent.
The IMAGEN study included 2223 adolescents recruited at age 14 for
MRI, genotyping, and self-report data collection who were assessed again 5
years later using the same battery. The ﬁnal sample of Albaugh et al. (N =
799) was used in the current study, with 162 participants removed for
lacking one or more of the additional measures added to this analysis. This
resulted in a ﬁnal sample of 637 participants, which did not differ on any
demographic or drug use measure from the sample of Albaugh et al. (p >
0.05). Of note, we also repeated analyses in the exact sample from Albaugh
et al. (N = 799) using only the variables included in that study, ﬁnding very
similar results (shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
Of note, participants were selected for the Albaugh et al. [1] study such
that all were cannabis naïve at age 14.
Measures
European school survey project on alcohol and drugs.
Cannabis use and
tobacco use were assessed at age 14 and age 19 with the ESPAD [19], a
self-report questionnaire regarding the use of alcohol, nicotine, and
cannabis as well as other substances. Participants indicated how many
times they had used each of the substances in their lifetime, in the past
12 months, in the past 30 days, and in the past 7 days using a 7-point
scale (where 0 indicates never; 1, 1–2 times; 2, 3–5 times; 3, 6–9 times;
4, 10–19 times; 5, 20–39 times; and 6, ≥40 times). However, since all
participants were selected to be cannabis naïve at age 14, only
cannabis use at age 19 was included in BCN modeling and other
analyses.
Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test.
The Alcohol Use Disorders
Identiﬁcation Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item alcohol screening tool that assesses
alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-associated problems
[20]. AUDIT was administered to youths at age 14 and 19. The AUDIT
Alcohol Consumption scale (AUDIT-C) was used in the present study and is
composed of items on AUDIT that explicitly assess the amount and
frequency of alcohol consumption.
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
(CTQ) is an assessment of adverse experiences occurring during
childhood with good validity and internal consistency [21]. This self-
report measure contains 70 items that make up ﬁve factors: physical
abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional
neglect. Responses are on a 5-point Likert-type scale according to the
frequency with which an experience occurred, with 1 = “never true” and
5 = “very often true.” In the current study, we summed the ﬁve factors to
create a total score.
Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire.
The Strengths and Difﬁculties
Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess symptoms of hyperactivity and
inattention [22], which we used as a measure of Attention Deﬁcit/
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The SDQ is a reliable and valid
measure of youth emotional and behavior symptoms; scores on the SDQ
are predictive of increased probability of clinician-rated psychiatric
disorders and it has good retest stability over 4–6 months [23].

Substance Use Risk Proﬁle Scale.
The Substance Use Risk Proﬁle Scale
(SURPS) was used to assess personality traits related to substance use
[24]. The SURPS is a 23-item 4-point Likert scale measure that assesses
four personality variables: anxiety sensitivity, introversion/hopelessness,
impulsivity,
and
sensation-seeking.
From
this
measure,
the
trait
sensation seeking was selected for BCN modeling, as it was the trait
with the largest bivariate relationship with cannabis use at age 19 (r =
0.29 at age 19).
Pubertal Development Scale.
Pubertal status was assessed using the
pubertal development scale, a self-report measure completed by the
participant. This measure has been shown to have good reliability and to
correspond with accepted self-report and biological measures of pubertal
development [25].
Socioeconomic status.
A composite of socioeconomic status (SES) was
derived by aggregating: Mother’s Education Score, Father’s Education
Score, Family Stress Unemployment Score, Financial Difﬁculties Score,
Home Inadequacy Score, Neighborhood Score, Financial Crisis Score,
Mother Employed Score, and Father Employed Score in a manner
consistent with prior work in the IMAGEN dataset [26].
Demographic questionnaire.
Children’s age, sex, and handedness were
measured using a demographic questionnaire completed by their parent/
guardian.
Structural MRI.
Structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) data were
acquired with a 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared
gradient echo sequence based on the one used in the Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative protocol [27]. These T1 images were
processed using the CIVET pipeline (v2.1.0) on the CBRAIN platform
using Compute Canada. In the current project, average cortical
thickness was extracted from the regions of interest identiﬁed in
Albaugh et al. that showed a dose-dependent response to cannabis use.
This region spanned the left and right dorsomedial and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortices and is hereafter referred to as the dorsal prefrontal
cortex (DPFC).
For consistency with prior work using BCN modeling in the IMAGEN
dataset [18], we used a principal components analysis to create a single
variable for cortical thickness in both hemispheres. All variables (cortical
thickness, cannabis use, other substance use, age, puberty, polygenic
risk score for cannabis use, childhood trauma, socioeconomic status,
handedness, and ADHD symptoms) were residualized for site and sex.
This single variable was derived from the ﬁrst principal component. This
was done for consistency with recent work using BCN modeling focused
on alcohol and brain morphometry in the IMAGEN dataset [18]. This was
done for DPFC thickness at age 14 (eigenvalue = 1.8; percent of
variance explained = 92%) and the change in DPFC from ages 14 to 19
(eigenvalue = 1.7; percent of variance explained = 87%).
Polygenic risk score.
In calculating a polygenic risk score (PRS) for
cannabis, genotypes were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project
phase 3 reference panel for Europeans using the Michigan Imputation
Server [28]. SNPs that did not meet quality control criteria (Minor Allele
Frequency < 0.01; Genotype Call Rate < 95%; Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium
< 1 × 10−6) were excluded. Genetic variants imputed with lower accuracy
(R2 < 0.6), insertion/deletions and palindromic
SNPs were excluded,
resulting in 5,183,147 SNPs. The PRS was calculated based on a genome-
wide association study (GWAS) conducted in an independent sample. This
GWAS described the genetic correlates of total lifetime frequency of
cannabis use using data from the International Cannabis Consortium, UK
Biobank, and 23andMe datasets [29]. All participants (53,179 cases and
131,586 controls) included in the GWAS were of European Ancestry, as are
all participants in the present analysis. This PRS was calculated using PLINK
2.0 [30]. Index variants were identiﬁed by clumping using an r2 threshold
of 0.1 with a 1000 kb window using the 1000 Genomes (EUR) as reference.
The available summary statistics for this GWAS included 11,535,788 SNPs.
After quality control procedures (i.e., removal of indels and palindromic
SNPs and retention of SNPs that overlap with those available for the target
sample) we had 4,595,692 SNPs, of which 145,015 remained after clumping
for use in the PRS. No p-value threshold from the GWAS was used for the
association of SNPs to cannabis use (i.e., p = 1.0 was used as the threshold
in PRSlice).
Analyses
To determine the relationship of variables to each other outside of BCN
modeling, we also conducted bivariate Pearson’s correlations between all
variables used in BCN analyses.
Then BCN analyses were conducted using the package bnlearn [16] in R
following a template of the analyses conducted in Robert et al. [18]. Code

Cannabis_Bayesian_Networks. First, a list of “blacklisted” pathways was
set (Supplementary Table 2), which are pathways that cannot exist for
logical reasons (e.g., age 19 cannabis use affecting sex at birth). Then the
structure learning algorithms were applied to derive directed acyclic
graphs representing the directional relationships between variables. To
derive statistics on the BCN models, the algorithms were run 10,000 times
with bootstrap re-sampling (i.e., samples drawn randomly with replace-
ment) for samples 100% of the size of the entire dataset. From these
bootstrapped BCN models a summary model is derived aggregating their
results. The strength of a connection between two variables was
determined as the percentage of the bootstrapped BCN models in which
a connection was present. The direction of a connection was determined
as the percentage of models with a connection in which the connection
was directed from one variable to another. To ensure a sparse model
containing only robust connections, we thresholded all models resulting
from structure learning algorithms such remove connections with strength
under 90%. Of note, this was primarily a choice made for visualization
purposes and did not affect the structure learning process.
We conducted BCN analyses using three different types of structure
learning algorithms. In score-based algorithms, the presence and direction
of the relationships between variables are determined by testing
numerous, randomly generated potential BCN models to evaluate which
conﬁguration of directed edges has the best model ﬁt [31, 32]. In
constraint-based algorithms, the speciﬁc tools used to determine the
directional relationship between variables are statistical independence
tests, which are combined with known rules about how the joint
probability of three variables provides information about their directional
relationship [32, 33]. In hybrid algorithms, key elements of score-based and
constraint-based algorithms are combined to leverage the strengths of
each approach.
To assess the consistency of results, we tested numerous structure
learning algorithms from the three domains of algorithm: score-based,
constraint-based, and hybrid [32, 34]. Our strategy was to extensively test
algorithms from each of the three major BCN structure learning algorithm
classes using a variety of options and parameters [32]. The algorithms and
parameters tested are shown in Table 2. In doing this, we picked the most
established algorithm in each class and created BCNs with that algorithm
using a variety of approaches. Then we tested a second algorithm within
these same classes using that approach’s default settings only. For the
score-based models we used the hill climbing algorithm as the primary
approach and the tabu algorithm as the secondary approach. For the
constraint-based models we used the grow-shrink algorithm as the
primary
approach
and
the
incremental
association
Markov
blanket algorithm as the secondary approach. For the hybrid models, we
used the max-min hill climbing algorithm as the primary approach and the
rsmax2 algorithm as the secondary approach.
As noted, we repeated the primary analyses from the score-based
algorithm approach (i.e., hill climbing) and the constraint-based algorithm
approach (i.e., grow-shrink) using different values for key modiﬁable
parameters. For the hill climbing algorithm, the speciﬁc ﬁt index by which
the model ﬁt is assessed is critical to the validity of this approach. Our
primary analysis used the Bayesian Information Criterion as the ﬁt index,
which is among the most common and interpretable of these criteria [35].
Additionally, a secondary analysis used the Akaike Information Criterion as
the ﬁt index. Another ﬂexible parameter for the hill climbing algorithm is
the starting point for model building. In our primary analysis the hill
climbing algorithm started from an empty BCN, but in a separate
secondary analysis the hill climbing algorithm started from a randomly
generated BCN. Additionally, perturbations can be randomly introduced to
the hill climbing algorithm to reduce the chance of landing at a local
minimum. Thus, in another secondary analysis, we introduced random
perturbations of the BCN to our primary analysis’s hill climbing procedure.
For the grow-shrink algorithm, the most ﬂexible parameter is the test used
to determine dependence/independence. Our primary dependence test
was the mutual information test, which determines the amount of
information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing
the other random variable [36]. However, in two separate secondary

analyses we used two other common independence tests: the Fisher Z test
and the Pearson’s correlation.
In addition to these analyses, we also built models using our primary
algorithm (hill climbing) with one direction between cannabis use and
DPFC thickness “blacklisted”. By testing both backlisted directions in
separate models, we were able to compare the two model’s ﬁt statistics as
another means of evaluating the directional relationship between these
two variables.
RESULTS
Preliminary analyses
Pearson’s correlation analyses are reported in Table 1. As expected
from Albaugh et al., change in cortical thickness in the dorsal
prefrontal (DPFC) region of interest between ages 14 and 19 was
associated with cannabis use during that same period (r = −0.17,
p = 1e-5). Of note, a cannabis use PRS [29] was associated with
cannabis use levels reported at age 19 (r = 0.10, p = 0.02).
Bayesian network results
All BCN modeling algorithms yielded similar patterns of connec-
tions with similar coefﬁcients. Figure 1 shows the summary model
from our primary analysis, which aggregates across the 10,000
bootstrapped resampling to yield strength and direction coefﬁ-
cients. This model used the hill climbing algorithm starting from
an empty graph with Bayesian information criterion as the
goodness of ﬁt metric and found that cannabis use was affecting
DPFC thickness in 96% of models. Notably, cannabis use was the
only variable directly affecting DPFC thickness. Also noteworthy,
despite their relationship in bivariate correlations, the cannabis
use PRS did not show a direct link to cannabis use in BCN
modeling.
Strength and direction coefﬁcients for the cannabis use to DPFC
thickness connection across all models are shown in Table 2.
Additionally, for all modeling approaches used, model coefﬁcients
with greater than 60% strength are reported in Supplementary
Tables 3–12. Our primary model, Hill Climbing, is also visualized
including all coefﬁcients with strength greater than 60% in
Supplementary
Fig.
2.
For
all
score-based
algorithms,
the
connection from cannabis use to DPFC thickness had a strength
ranging from 99% to 100% and a direction ranging from 91% to
96%. Similar results were found across constraint-based algo-
rithms, with the connection from cannabis use to DPFC thickness
having strength ranging from 91% to 97% and direction ranging
from 81% to 82%. The two-hybrid algorithms, Max–min hill
climbing and RSMAX2, showed comparable results to the score-
based algorithms, ﬁnding strength values of 92%/93% and
direction values of 95% in these algorithms. In analyses with
one direction restricted (i.e., “blacklisted”) between DPFC thickness
and cannabis use, the model in which cannabis use was only
allowed to affect DPFC thickness had a better ﬁt than the model in
which DPFC thickness was only allowed to affect cannabis use
(ΔBIC = 5.2).
DISCUSSION
In using BCN modeling to attempt to disentangle the direction-
ality of the relationship between adolescent cannabis use and
DPFC thinning, the current study’s results were overwhelmingly
supportive of the conclusion that adolescent cannabis use affects
DPFC thickness rather than the alternative hypotheses that DPFC
thickness development affects an adolescent’s likelihood of
beginning to use cannabis or that the two are not affecting one
another. To ensure stability of the results, we tested two
algorithms from each of the three BCN structure learning classes
using a variety of analytic approaches for each algorithm. In
addition to these bottom-up approaches to model building, we
also used a top-down model building strategy that pre-speciﬁed

the relationship between cannabis use and change in DPFC
thickness to test which showed a better model ﬁt. BCNs built using
every algorithm and parameter combination indicated cannabis
was affecting DPFC thickness, with most models ﬁnding this in
over 90% of bootstrap samples and all models ﬁnding this in over
80% of bootstrap samples. Score-based and constraint-based
approaches to BCN construction are sufﬁciently unique that their
convergence in the current study adds to the conﬁdence of these
results. Thus, the consistency of results among these approaches is
compelling evidence in favor of a causal relationship of adolescent
cannabis use on DPFC thickness.
One notable feature of the models constructed is that the
strength of the relationship between cannabis use and DPFC
thickness was expected given how the region was chosen: the
region of DPFC that we used was selected speciﬁcally because it
was found in our previous work to be related to cannabis use [1].
Therefore, it was unsurprising that the strength of the connection
between cannabis use and DPFC thinning from ages 14 to 19 was
100%. However, what is notable in the current results is that the
direction of this relationship was so consistently found to go from
cannabis use to cortical thickness. This was not explored in our
previous analyses and represents the unique contribution of
this study.
There are several relationships noteworthy for being present or
absent in the current ﬁndings. Many connections identiﬁed by the
BCN algorithms were expected based on existing literature. For
instance, low socioeconomic status showed a directional effect on
smoking at age 14, which is consistent with a robust literature
linking smoking to low socioeconomic status [37]. Likewise, early
pubertal development showed a directional relationship with age
14 alcohol use, as has been shown previously [38]. However, there
were also expected relationships not present. One of these was a
relationship between the cannabis PRS and cannabis use. Despite
its bivariate association with cannabis use (r = 0.10), the PRS for
cannabis use was not associated with cannabis use in any BCN
model. This is because BCN models report the relationship
between variables in the context of all other variables in the
model, suggesting that other factors in the model better explain
the likelihood of cannabis use. The lack of associations of the
cannabis PRS with cannabis use or DPFC thickness is evidence
against an alternate explanation that a pre-existing genetic
trajectory causally affects DPFC thinning and cannabis use in a
confounding manner. There were also some expected relation-
ships that were not observed in our main model but were found
when the strength threshold was lowered to 60%, as reported in
Supplementary Tables 3–12. For example, there was a directional
relationship from ADHD symptoms at age 14 to alcohol use at age
14, suggesting that ADHD may have a weak directional effect on
alcohol use. Further, it should be noted that the current results
differ from the observed relationship between alcohol use and
brain structure using BCN structure learning algorithms conducted
by Robert et al. [18]. In that study, BCN structure learning
algorithms overwhelmingly indicated that volume reduction in
the prefrontal and temporal cortices was causally affected by
alcohol consumption in adolescents from the IMAGEN study. The
discrepancy between that study and the current one illustrates
that BCN algorithms can arrive at quite different results in similar
situations.
Given their importance to the current study, it is worth
considering how BCN structure learning algorithms estimate the
directional relationships between variables. These algorithms
apply an emerging understanding of how directional relationships
are predicated on conditional dependence to determine the BCN
that best represents the joint probability distributions of a dataset
[16]. In score-based algorithms, the presence and direction of the
relationships
between
variables
are
determined
by
testing
numerous, randomly generated potential BCN models to evaluate
which conﬁguration of directed edges has the best model ﬁt
[31, 32]. In constraint-based algorithms, the speciﬁc tools used to
determine the directional relationship between variables are

statistical independence tests, which are combined with known
rules about how the joint probability of three variables provides
information about their directional relationship [32, 33]. In hybrid
algorithms, key elements of score-based and constraint-based
algorithms are combined to leverage the strengths of each
approach. Score-based and constraint-based approaches to BCN
construction are sufﬁciently unique that their convergence in the
current study adds to our conﬁdence in these results. Within the
assumptions and constraints of the methodology, BCN models
offer a
complementary
approach
to
infer probable
causal
associations from amidst the complex, confounded, and colinear
measurements that so typically characterizes nonexperimental
human research.
One important limitation of these ﬁndings is that BCN modeling
estimates the direction of a relationship only in the context of the
variables included in its models: BCN modeling is not able to
detect hidden or unmeasured variables that may be affecting the
variables within the model and, consequently, like most statistical
methods, is susceptible to unmeasured confounders. The present
analysis did include many relevant variables in the BCN model that
represent
obvious
potential
confounding
factors,
including
demographics, genetics, psychopathology, personality, childhood
adversity, and measures of other substance use. While there are, of
course, an inﬁnitely large number of potential confounders, the
current analysis suggests that in the context of many of the most
likely confounders, there is a directional relationship from
adolescent cannabis use to dorsal prefrontal cortical thickness
that is consistent with causality. However, it remains possible that
some unmeasured confounder could alter these results. Consider-
ing this, we suggest that the best way to conceive of the present
approach is that it addresses a central, but unresolved, question
on the directionality of the previously observed association
between cannabis use and dorsal prefrontal cortex thickness,
but that it does so within the conﬁnes of the speciﬁc (and
necessarily ﬁnite) number of confounders that were included.
While certainly not deﬁnitive, the present results provide a
thorough initial test of this question using BCNs, ﬁnding results
highly supportive of a causal effect of cannabis on brain
development. We hope that future work, whether employing
causal modeling or not, further investigates this matter and
continues to evaluate other potential confounding variables.
Another consideration is that the association between DPFC
thinning and cannabis use was still relatively small, r = 0.17 in
bivariate analyses. This suggests that there is much more than
cannabis use that goes into cortical development and other
important psychological and social contributors to development
should not be overlooked. Of note, cannabis use was assessed in
the current study using a retrospective, self-report measure and its
possible that with a more thorough measure (e.g., ecological
momentary assessment of cannabis use) the effect sizes seen in
bivariate analyses may have been larger. However, a correlation of
0.17 is not insigniﬁcant either, particularly when compared to
other meaningful effect sizes found in similar datasets [39].
Prior research has estimated normative cortical thinning of
around 1% annually, which comes out to around 0.03–0.06 mm
per year [8–11]. Results of the current study were highly consistent
with this prior literature, as the average percent reduction in
cortical thickness from ages 14 to 19 was 3.6% (i.e., 0.12 mm
reduction in thickness). In cannabis-using participants, the average
percent reduction was 4.4% (0.14 mm reduction in thickness),
compared to an average reduction of 3.1% in cannabis abstinent
participants (a 0.10 mm reduction in thickness). The heaviest using
participants (those who used cannabis 40 or more times between
the ages of 14 and 19) demonstrated a 5% reduction in cortical
thickness (i.e., 0.17 mm reduction in thickness), while the lightest
using participants (those reporting fewer than 10 uses between
the ages of 14 and 19) showed a 4.1% reduction (0.13 mm).
Compared to those who did not use cannabis, this represents a

30% greater reduction in cortical thickness in all cannabis-using
participants, a 24% greater reduction in the lightest using
participants, and a 38% greater reduction in the heaviest using
participants. Notably, differences in rate of thinning comparable to
those found in the current manuscript have been noted as
signifying greater risk of depression in adolescents in other work
[14]. Thus, while noting that the quantiﬁcation of cortical thinning
is imperfect, resting on MRI contrast images [40], we think that
these ﬁndings do suggest an association sufﬁciently large to merit
concern.
The present results report a notable association between DPFC
thinning and cannabis use in a dose-dependent manner. While
noting again the caveats associated with inferring causation from
human research, these ﬁndings complement other humans
[1, 3, 4, 7, 41] and animal [5] research and add to the increasingly
compelling evidence base that adolescent cannabis use affects
brain development.
