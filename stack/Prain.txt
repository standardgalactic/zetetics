Summary 
 
This thesis reports an investigation of interactions between adults with 
congenital deafblindness and the disability support workers who mediate their 
support. These interactions are examined with a view to better understanding 
how social togetherness, or the good life as posited by Reinders (2002), might 
be better understood, evaluated and ultimately enhanced.  
 
A number of studies investigate interactions between children with congenital 
deafblindness and their parents and educators, and there is increasing 
evidence of the efficacy of interventions to enhance these interactions. 
However, there is very little information in the scientific literature which 
contributes to a better understanding of interactions for adults with congenital 
deafblindness and approaches which are effective with these adults. While 
some authors argue that approaches used with children are equally applicable 
to adults, there are a number of key differences between children and adults 
with congenital deafblindness. In particular, the circumstances surrounding their 
social and communicative interactions have not been adequately addressed in 
the literature. It is this paucity of knowledge which this thesis seeks to address 
to better inform policy and practice. The thesis draws on the literature 
concerning adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities as there are 
many similarities in social and emotional development, and the practical 
circumstances of support shared by these two groups.      
 

2 
 
In order to better understand the good life for adults with congenital 
deafblindness, the study employed a mixed method design. An observational 
coding approach was combined with interviews of interaction partners to better 
understand what occurs in the interactions of adults with congenital 
deafblindness.  
 
This thesis highlights the importance of using mixed methods, or at least 
multiple perspectives, when evaluating interactions with adults with congenital 
deafblindness. It demonstrates that examining interactions from only one 
perspective, or using one method in isolation, gives a limited and partial 
understanding of the situation. For example, the findings from phase one of the 
study reported in this thesis demonstrated few instances of interaction between 
adults with congenital deafblindness and their support staff. Similar studies in 
the past have interpreted such results as suggesting that the staff required 
further training in how to interact with their clients. However, the findings from 
phase two of the study, which used a different research method, revealed 
higher levels of interaction. Phase two also yielded additional information that 
helped to explain the low levels of interaction observed in the first phase. The 
findings from this second phase suggest a mismatch in worldviews between 
disability support workers and those formulating interventions to enhance 
interactions for adults with congenital deafblindness. For this reason, staff 
training to address issues raised by the first phase of the study, without 
reference to the findings and insights gained from the second phase, may not 
deliver long-term, positive outcomes for adults with congenital deafblindness. 

3 
 
This is because the type of intervention does not adequately address the 
mismatch in worldviews between the intervener and the disability support 
workers.  
 
There is a clear need for multiple methods and perspectives in both evaluating 
and enhancing interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness. This 
thesis offers some practical recommendations to progress the situation for 
clinicians, researchers, disability support workers, and most importantly adults 
with congenital deafblindness. However, much work remains to develop 
effective tools and methods for evaluating interactions with people with 
congenital deafblindness. This thesis also poses some important questions 
about evaluating opportunities for adults with congenital deafblindness to 
experience the good life within the broader quality of life construct.

Chapter One: Introduction  
 
Little is known about the interpersonal experiences of adults with congenital 
deafblindness. In the course of my work as a speech pathologist visiting adults 
with congenital deafblindness in their own homes and day settings, I became 
curious about the dissonance between the evidence-based literature in the field 
of congenital deafblindness and the practices I observed. Upon reflection and 
examination of current literature I questioned the extent to which adults with 
congenital deafblindness experience the good life, a concept posited by 
Reinders (2002). According to Reinders (2002) the good life is one which 
includes civic friendship; a relationship that goes beyond legal and service 
related spheres, and which involves living together in the pursuit of shared 
ideals. I was also interested in how to better understand the current interactions 
of adults with congenital deafblindness, and how to measure the quality of their 
interactions and their lives. 
 
This thesis is about interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness 
and the disability support workers who mediate their support. The thesis is 
exploratory in nature and has largely arisen out of my concern with the 
extremely limited success I have experienced in achieving lasting, sustainable 
outcomes for the adults with congenital deafblindness with whom I work. While 
the theory and evidence found in the scientific literature relevant to this field 
appear sound, they do not adequately account for the issues I have 
experienced in creating lasting change for adults with congenital deafblindness. 
Consequently, this thesis is fundamentally an exploration of relationships. 

5 
 
Relationships between disability support workers and adults with congenital 
deafblindness, between scientist practitioners and adults with congenital 
deafblindness, and between scientist practitioners and disability support 
workers. Clearly, there are multiple sets and combinations of relationships 
which require attention in order to better understand and create opportunities for 
adults with congenital deafblindness to experience the good life. 
 
The remainder of this introductory chapter explains the reasons why particular 
words, styles and language are used throughout this thesis; namely, the use of 
full words rather than acronyms, the use of the term deafblind, and the use of 
the personal pronoun I. Definitions of key terms used throughout the thesis are 
presented, as well as an explanation of why literature on people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities has been used. Key similarities and 
differences between adults with congenital deafblindness and people with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities are also discussed. The chapter 
concludes with an overview of the remaining chapters in this thesis. 
 
Clarification of terms and language  
The use of full words rather than acronyms  
There are a number of terms used repeatedly throughout this thesis which could 
be abbreviated to acronyms. For example, people with congenital deafblindness 
could be abbreviated with an acronym to people with CDB. While it is 
recognised that this is a more expeditious means of expression, the full words 
will be used throughout the thesis for a number of reasons.  

6 
 
First, there is considerable disagreement and discrepancy amongst different 
authors about the appropriate terms to be used, including some country and 
regional differences. Because of these differences, if acronyms are used, some 
confusion can arise as to what each letter in the acronym represents. For 
example, people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (see 
definition below) can be referred to as people with: profound and multiple 
disabilities (PMD), profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD), profound 
learning disabilities (PLD), and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
(PIMD). Indeed, at the 12th World Congress of the International Association for 
the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disability, 11 different terms were used in 41 
presentations to describe what were supposedly the same group of people 
(Nakken & Vlaskamp, 2007). 
 
Second, within disciplines acronyms become a common way to expedite 
communication. However, for people outside or new to a discipline the 
acronyms have no meaning and can be alienating. The focus of this thesis is on 
human interaction and communication; people from a variety of disciplines are 
likely to find it of relevance and interest. It therefore seems important to optimise 
shared meaning and understanding, and minimise the opportunity for 
miscommunication, which acronyms have the potential to create. 
 
Finally, Miller and Crabtree (2000) argue that most clinical research is published 
in a language that benefits researchers, not the people and clinicians which the 

7 
 
research is about. Consequently, they call for this issue of language to be 
redressed by qualitative researchers in particular.  
 
The use of the term deafblind 
There is no one internationally recognised and accepted way of writing 
deafblind. Enersdvedt (1996) notes that the terms deafblind, deaf-blind, dual 
sensory impaired, and multisensory impaired are all used to describe this 
population. He states that while dual sensory and multisensory may be more 
accurate and to the point, historically deafblind and deaf-blind have been used 
and are still the most commonly used terms.  
 
The term deafblind will be used in this thesis rather than the hyphenated 
version. This recognises that deafblindness is a condition presenting other 
difficulties than those caused by deafness and blindness alone, and that the 
whole is more than the sum of its parts (Wills, 2011, p. 2). 
 
The use of I 
The first person, I, will be used throughout this thesis as it is considered 
important to highlight and acknowledge the role of researcher as instrument and 
how this instrument has been calibrated (cf. Guba & Lincoln, 1981). My 
experiences as a speech pathologist working with people with deafblindness for 
over 15 years have influenced the nature of this research project and it is 
necessary to be aware of these experiences to better understand the project. 
Furthermore, Kamler and Thomson (2006) emphasise the importance of 

8 
 
reflexivity in research. They argue that research is about the personal and the 
person of the researcher, and that reflexive practice involves the use of the 
personal I. Additionally, using the personal I helps to address the “discredited 
modernist pretence of impersonal objectivity in research writing” (V. Prain, 
1997). 
 
Key terms and definitions  
Congenital deafblindness—see below under the clarification of populations 
being discussed. 
 
Disability support worker—multiple terms are used in the literature for this role, 
including direct support worker, carer, attendant carer, special care worker and 
instructor. The term used in this thesis to denote this role is disability support 
worker, as this is the term used by the organisation that employs the staff who 
participated in this study. This term is commonly used in Australia to describe 
staff employed to work with people with disabilities in their homes, day centres 
and in the community. The term is consistent with the occupational roles 
covered by two definitions from the Australian Standard Classification of 
Occupations, Australian Bureau of Statistics:  
3421-15 Residential Care Officer: Provides care and supervision for children or 
disabled persons in group housing or government institutions….  
 
3421-17 Disabilities Services Officer: Works in a range of adult service units 
which provide education and community access to people with intellectual, 
physical, social and emotional disabilities (McLennan, 1997, p. 275). 
  
Profound intellectual and multiple disability—see below under the clarification of 
populations being discussed.  

9 
 
 
Scientist practitioner—this term will be used throughout the thesis to describe 
clinicians, researchers and clinical researchers. The scientist practitioner model 
“values the contributions of both science training and practice training to the 
education of a psychologist” (Stricker, 2002, p. 1277). It is equally applicable to 
other health sciences and researcher practitioners from other disciplines such 
as health, allied health and education. The scientist practitioner model equally 
values research and practice and sees value in including both, regardless of 
whether it is research or practice which is being undertaken.  
 
Given much of the research in the field of congenital deafblindness is done by 
practitioners who have recognised the need to evaluate the efficacy of their 
interventions the scientist practitioner model is of particular relevance. The 
literature on congenital deafblindness is equally relevant and applicable for both 
clinicians and researchers. Therefore, it is reasonable and expeditious to use 
the term scientist practitioner when referring to clinicians, researchers, and 
clinical researchers in this field.  
 
It should be noted, the term scientist practitioner is not commonly used in the 
fields of deafblindness or profound intellectual and multiple disability, or indeed 
within my own profession of speech pathology. Consequently, the use of the 
term scientist practitioner will be examined further in chapter seven, in light of 
findings from the current study, to determine the relevance and application of 
this term to these fields.   

10 
 
Clarification of populations being discussed  
Two distinct groups of people will be discussed throughout this study: people 
with congenital deafblindness and people with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. It is important that both groups are mentioned individually 
throughout the study. While these two groups have much in common, there are 
also some important distinctions which mean they cannot be viewed as one 
group. However, it is useful to consider each of these groups when examining 
issues relating to one or the other, as much can be learnt from one group which 
is of relevance to the other. For example, there is extremely limited literature 
specifically addressing measures of quality of life for people with congenital 
deafblindness. However, there is more literature addressing quality of life 
measures for people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. This can 
provide insights into issues around measuring the quality of life of people with 
congenital deafblindness who have in common idiosyncratic communication 
and complex support needs. 
 
Certainly there are many similarities between models of interaction and 
intervention strategies used with each group, and a number of authors 
acknowledge these similarities. For example, Hostyn and Maes (2009) note the 
similarity between the core characteristics of interaction with people with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities and those characteristics identified 
by Janssen et al. (2003b) in their study involving children with congenital 
deafblindness. These authors collaborated to develop the Scale for Dialogical 
Meaning Making (Hostyn, Janssen, Daelman, & Maes, 2009), a tool potentially 

11 
 
useful in evaluating interactions with both people with congenital deafblindness 
and those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Caldwell (2006) 
notes the similarities between the approaches of Intensive Interaction, used with 
people with learning difficulties who are nonverbal, and Co-creating 
Communication, the approach described by Nafstad and Rodbroe (1999) in 
guiding work with people with congenital deafblindness. In addition, the final 
report from a project conducted in the United States of America investigating 
the assessment of children with deafblindness included children with multiple 
disabilities. It recognised the similar issues related to assessment that these two 
groups, which often overlap, face (see Rowland, Chen, Stillman, & Mar, 2009).  
 
Before looking at the similarities and differences between these two groups, it is 
important to define each group separately in order to establish which 
interventions and approaches are applicable for each group and why. Nakken 
and Vlaskamp (2007) argue the need to establish which treatments and 
interventions are most effective with people with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities as distinct from other groups which may appear to have 
similar characteristics.   
 
Congenital deafblindness 
The definition of deafblindness used in this study is a functional rather than a 
medical definition; it is the definition used by Deafblind International (see 
http://www.deafblindinternational.org): 
 

12 
 
The term deafblindness describes a condition that combines in varying degrees 
both hearing and visual impairment. Two sensory impairments multiply and 
intensify the impact of each other creating a severe disability which is different 
and unique. All deafblind people experience problems with communication, 
access to information and mobility. However, their specific needs vary 
enormously according to age, onset and type of deafblindness.  
Deafblind people are unable to use one sense to fully compensate for the 
impairment of the other. Thus they will require services which are different from 
those designed exclusively for either blind people or deaf people (Deafblind 
International, 2012). 
 
This study focuses on the subgroup of people with congenital deafblindness. 
People with congenital deafblindness were born with a combined vision and 
hearing impairment, or lost vision and hearing prior to the acquisition of 
language (Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006a). 
 
Profound intellectual and multiple disability 
The definition of profound intellectual and multiple disability used in this study is 
also a functional, rather than a clinical definition. It is taken from a report on the 
needs of, and services for, people with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities in the United Kingdom (Mansell, 2010):  
People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (this phrase is the 
term used internationally. It refers to the same people often identified in the UK 
as having ‘profound and multiple learning disabilities’) are among the most 
disabled individuals in our community. They have a profound intellectual 
disability, which means that their intelligence quotient is estimated to be under 
20 and therefore that they have severely limited understanding (World Health 
Organisation, 1992). In addition, they have multiple disabilities, which may 
include impairments of vision, hearing and movement as well as other problems 
like epilepsy and autism. Most people in this group are unable to walk unaided 
and many people have complex health needs requiring extensive help. People 
with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities have great difficulty 
communicating; they typically have very limited understanding and express 
themselves through non-verbal means, or at most through using a few words or 
symbols. They often show limited evidence of intention. Some people have, in 
addition, problems of challenging behaviour such as self-injury (Mansell, 2010, 
p. 3). 

13 
 
Similarities between adults with congenital deafblindness and adults 
with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
Low incidence disabilities  
Congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disability are 
low incidence disabilities. Their occurrence in the general population is rare and 
consequently they form minority groups in terms of presence in the general 
community, disability support services, and the research literature. Being low 
incidence disabilities has implications for service delivery, research, and the 
development of appropriate and relevant policies governing service delivery, 
which will be discussed at the end of this section.      
While recognised as being low in incidence, considerable challenges remain in 
determining exact numbers of people with these disabilities. Estimates suggest, 
even with changes in the population of people with deafblindness, that about 
200 people per million inhabitants of a developed country will have 
deafblindness, and about one fifth of these people will have congenital 
deafblindness (Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006a).  In Australia, it was estimated that 
there were 3,984 people with deafblindness in 2005. This was based on 
estimates of there being 20 per 100,000 people with deafblindness in developed 
countries (M. Prain, 2005). However, only 682 (14.45%) of these people were 
identified in Prain’s (2005) study due to the way in which information about 
disability type is recorded by governments and service providers in Australia.   
It has also proven problematic to establish accurate estimates of prevalence of 
people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Emerson (2009a, 
2009b) established an estimate of the number of people with profound 

14 
 
intellectual and multiple disabilities in England of 16,442. Given the population 
of England was estimated to be 51,810,000 in 2009 (Office for National 
Statistics, 2011) the percentage of people with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities from these estimates is 0.032%. Emerson (2009a, 2009b) also 
reports that this figure will accelerate further in years to come, with a greater 
number of people reaching adulthood. In Australia, McVilly and Forster (2010) 
applied a similar methodology to that adopted by Emerson (2009a, 2009b) and 
achieved comparable results.  
In order to better understand how these low incidence groups compare with 
other disability groups it is necessary to also look at population estimates of 
other groups. For example, Wellesly, Hockey, Montgomery and Stanly (1992) 
found 0.76% with intellectual disability compared to 0.06% with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. People with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities, and also often adults with congenital deafblindness, are 
subgroups of the larger group of people with intellectual disabilities. For this 
reason there is potential for their different and specific needs to go unaddressed 
as policies and service delivery models relevant to the majority are applied to 
them. The low incidence of people with congenital deafblindness and profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities also means they have received less 
attention from researchers. Thus their needs are not as well documented and 
addressed as the needs of people with mild and moderate intellectual 
disabilities and no sensory impairments.   

15 
 
Shared services and the policies which shape these services  
In Australia there are few accommodation services specifically for adults with 
congenital deafblindness and no day services specifically for this group.  
Consequently, these adults receive services alongside adults with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities, and other disabilities (M. Prain, 2005; Ward, 
1994). For this reason, adults with congenital deafblindness receive services 
from staff who are guided by general, rather than disability specific, training and 
policies. It is therefore relevant to investigate literature on training, intervention 
strategies and the perceptions and attitudes of staff working with adults with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities when researching the situation for 
adults with congenital deafblindness, and vice versa.

means 
of 
communication requiring skilled and sensitive communication partners. The 
reasons why each group use idiosyncratic behaviours may vary. Adults with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities use nonlinguistic means of 
expression due to cognitive impairments. Adults with congenital deafblindness 
use nonlinguistic means of expression because of dual sensory impairment. 
Both groups require communication partners to be highly observant and aware 
of facial expression, vocalisations, body language and muscle tension. It is 
important to note that many adults with congenital deafblindness do develop 

16 
 
symbolic means of communication. However, the focus of this study is on those 
adults who communicate primarily through nonsymbolic means.  
 
The description of people for whom Intensive Interaction (see Nind & Hewett, 
1994) is an appropriate intervention describes both people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities and many adults with congenital 
deafblindness.  
Intensive Interaction is relevant for people who: 
- 
have few or limited communication behaviors 
- 
lack the abilities needed for being social with other people  
- 
may have ritualistic, self involved, self injurious or aggressive 
behaviours which exclude others 
- 
remain untouched by traditional approaches.  
- 
do not yet know that being with another human being can be 
unthreatening and even pleasurable (Nind & Hewett, 1994, p. 11). 
 
The importance of touch  
Touch is an important aspect of communication for both adults with congenital 
deafblindness and adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, but 
for different reasons. Touch is the earliest sense to develop and the last sense 
to fade (Nicholas, 2010). This makes it a powerful sense for augmenting or 
providing information to adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
whose other senses, particularly vision and hearing, may not always provide 
meaningful information. Many adults with congenital deafblindness on the other 
hand require information to be provided in a tactile way simply because of the 
absence of vision and hearing. Even those adults with congenital deafblindness 
who have functional vision and hearing, like adults with profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities, will benefit from having visual and auditory information 
supplemented with tactile information.  

17 
 
Differences between adults with congenital deafblindness and 
adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
From the above information it is clear that people with congenital deafblindness 
and those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities have a number of 
attributes in common. However, it is important to recognise key differences 
between the groups in order to ensure their defining and specific needs are 
addressed from a policy and service delivery perspective.  
 
People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities are more likely to have 
vision and hearing impairments than the rest of the population (Meuwese-
Jongejeugd et al., 2008). This means some adults belong to both groups. The 
primary difference between adults with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities and adults with congenital deafblindness is the difference in 
cognitive ability. Cognitive ability is often masked in adults with congenital 
deafblindness by their dual sensory impairment and ability to develop higher 
level communication skills is greater in this group. For this reason, there are 
intervention strategies, particularly around meaning making and development of 
symbolic communication, which are more applicable to adults with congenital 
deafblindness than those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (see 
Souriau, Rodbroe, & Janssen, 2008). 
 
Forster, Gray, Taffe, Einfeld and Tonge (2011) point out that there are 
significant differences between people with severe intellectual disabilities and 
those with profound intellectual disabilities in scores on the Developmental 
Behaviour Checklist, indicating differences in behavioural and emotional 

18 
 
problems. Because of these differences, it is important to exercise caution when 
treating the two separate groups as one single group. 
 
Overview of thesis chapters 
Chapter two of the thesis focuses on the relationship between adults with 
congenital deafblindness and scientist practitioners. It presents the ways in 
which scientist practitioners have understood and evaluated the situation for 
people with congenital deafblindness. The chapter describes the notion of the 
good life, which underpins the central issue to be examined in this thesis. It 
provides a broad overview of the construct of quality of life, within the context of 
intellectual disability, and discusses useful frameworks for operationalising the 
good life. It then examines what is currently known about interactions with 
people with congenital deafblindness. The chapter concludes with an 
examination of the differences between adults and children with congenital 
deafblindness, highlighting the need for specific research into the situation for 
adults.  
 
One of the key differences for adults with congenital deafblindness is their 
interaction partners, namely disability support workers. Chapter three examines 
what is currently known about interactions between disability support workers 
and people who communicate primarily through nonsymbolic means, and how 
this information has been generated. As stated earlier, adults with congenital 
deafblindness often share services with people with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. There is value in examining the literature on interactions 

19 
 
between 
disability 
support 
workers 
and 
people 
who 
communicate 
nonsymbolically to gain insights into what may be occurring for adults with 
congenital deafblindness.  
 
An overview of current intervention strategies aimed at enhancing and 
improving interactions is examined and critiqued. The key intervention 
strategies 
discussed 
are 
participative 
management, 
supervision 
and 
observational approaches, Active Support, Intensive Interaction, and video 
feedback strategies. As this thesis is concerned with evaluating the degree to 
which adults with congenital deafblindness experience the good life, typically 
used outcome measures are examined. The discussion highlights the 
inadequacy of currently used measures to satisfactorily evaluate opportunities 
for experiencing the good life.  
 
The majority of the information in chapter three, and indeed in the literature, is 
from the perspective of scientist practitioners. There seems considerable value 
in gaining a greater understanding of what is occurring in interactions with 
disability support workers from their own perspective. Chapter three therefore 
also examines what is currently known and understood from the perspective of 
disability support workers. The chapter concludes with an examination of the 
broader context within which disability support workers are operating in order to 
provide greater insight into factors which may impact on their interactions.  
 

20 
 
Chapter four discusses how my own perspectives have been shaped and 
influenced. While chapters two and three raise some methodological issues 
about examining interactions between disability support workers and people 
who communicate nonsymbolically, chapter four examines some of the 
methodological issues inherent in research with adults with congenital 
deafblindness. It also looks at how the nature of congenital deafblindness 
influences research methodologies. In addition, the research design used for 
the two phases of the study in this thesis is presented. 
 
Given the participants in phase one and phase two of the study are almost 
identical, chapter four concludes with descriptions of the research participants in 
each phase of the study and the context of the study.  
 
Chapter five presents the aims, design and results of the first quantitative phase 
of the study. It concludes with an analysis of the methodological issues, 
challenges, and potential solutions to the problems encountered using an 
observational coding method. Attention is given to the potential benefits and 
issues related to using a consensus coding approach. 
 
Chapter six presents the aims, design and results from the second qualitative 
phase of the study. Chapter six concludes with an evaluation of the quality of 
the research undertaken in phase two using Tracy’s (2010) eight big tent 
considerations for quality in qualitative research.  
 

21 
 
Chapter seven presents a summary of key findings from the quantitative and 
the qualitative phases of this study in light of existing literature and theory. The 
need for alternative intervention and research methodologies is highlighted. 
These would optimise opportunities for people with congenital deafblindness 
and those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities to experience the 
good life. Key elements addressed include the need for multiple perspectives 
and the need to address power imbalances in research and intervention. The 
concepts of reciprocity and relational agency are examined as strategies for 
addressing power imbalances. This section highlights the lack of reciprocity 
between researchers and research participants, and the dearth of processes 
involved in relational agency in research in congenital deafblindness to date. 
The application of Integral Theory and action research are presented as 
potential frameworks to address the current methodological and philosophical 
issues inherent in this field. Video Interaction Guidance is a current intervention 
tool used to promote opportunities to experience the good life. Video Interaction 
Guidance is presented, in conjunction with the principles of action research, as 
being consistent with many of the requirements that are necessary to foster 
sustainable positive outcomes. The chapter also examines organisational and 
governmental policies in the context of creating long-term sustainable outcomes 
for people with congenital deafblindness and people with profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities.   
Chapter eight provides a summary of the key findings and the contribution of 
the research documented in this thesis. It also presents the limitations of the 

22 
 
study. Chapter eight concludes with the theoretical, philosophical, research and 
clinical implications of the study. 
 
 

23 
 
Chapter Two: Adults with congenital deafblindness and 
their experience of the good life 
 
As mentioned at the start of the introduction, this thesis is fundamentally an 
examination of three sets of relationships involving adults with congenital 
deafblindness, disability support workers and scientist practitioners. This 
chapter focuses on the scientist practitioner’s relationship with adults with 
congenital deafblindness. It discusses the related issue of scientist practitioners’ 
relationships with adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
These relationships are largely evaluative in nature. That is, for the most part 
scientist practitioners have endeavoured to develop models and tools with 
which to examine and evaluate the behaviours and development of people with 
congenital deafblindness. This chapter also presents the ways in which scientist 
practitioners have understood and interpreted the life circumstances for adults 
with congenital deafblindness and people with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. The chapter includes some evaluation of the methodologies used to 
date and highlights some problems with these methodologies. Many of these 
methodological difficulties are considered in more detail in chapter four. It is 
important to present current theories, models and frameworks for evaluating the 
interactions of adults with congenital deafblindness in order to determine the 
best way to evaluate the efficacy of interventions with this group. It is also 
important to understand the limitations of current tools in order to assess 
options to expand on what is currently available to address these limitations.  
 

24 
 
This chapter presents Reinders’ (2002) concept of the good life, as it underpins 
the problems observed in the interactions of adults with congenital 
deafblindness which this thesis explores. The examination of the good life 
highlights the need for an emphasis on the social interactions of adults with 
congenital deafblindness in both research and practice.  
 
However, in understanding the importance of the good life for adults with 
congenital deafblindness, it is necessary to appreciate how this concept fits 
within the quality of life construct. Therefore, an overview of what is currently 
understood by scientist practitioners about evaluating the quality of life of 
people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, and why this may be 
applied to adults with congenital deafblindness, is presented. This is followed by 
a more detailed look at how the good life, as posited by Reinders (2002), can be 
operationalised using both a quality of life framework and a framework of 
interaction based on human communication development theory. A number of 
existing models are discussed, including how they are, or could potentially be, 
used to gain insights into the degree to which an individual has opportunities to 
experience the good life.   
 
Once these overarching concepts necessary to understanding the topic have 
been presented, the chapter focuses on what is currently known and 
understood about interactions with people with congenital deafblindness. 
Initially an historical perspective is taken to help frame and locate the current 
study in time. The chapter then focuses specifically on what is known and 

25 
 
understood about interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness. As the 
literature about interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness is limited, 
what is known and understood about interactions with children with 
deafblindness is presented to gain greater insight into what may be occurring 
for adults. The differences between the situation for children and that of adults 
are also highlighted.  
 
The good life  
The good life according to (J. S. Reinders, 2002) is the central concept 
underpinning the problem to be addressed in this thesis. Reinders argues that:  
people with ID [intellectual disability] are People First, i.e. they are not just 
citizens, but human beings in the first place. They are not only bearers of 
institutional roles, they are also – and more importantly – identified by their 
proper names. To regard them in that capacity, we do not talk about students 
tenants, employees or clients; instead, we talk about John, Jack or Jody. To 
include them in that capacity we need to include them in our informal 
relationships as well as our institutions. If community living is a human 
experience, we should expect that people with disabilities want to be included in 
the lives of others as John, Jack or Jody, i.e. we should expect them to want us 
not only as bearers of institutional roles, but as friends and companions who 
have chosen them to be part of their lives. To be part of a social world is to be 
included in the bonds of civic friendship. ‘Civic friendship’ in this connection 
means a type of relationship between citizens which goes beyond the legal 
sphere and includes the social sphere. People who enjoy civic friendship live 
and work together in the pursuit of shared ideals. To be included in these kinds 
of relationships is what makes human life worth living for everybody, not just 
people with ID [intellectual disability] (J. S. Reinders, 2002, p. 3). 
 
Reinders (2002) is reflecting primarily on the circumstances of people with an 
intellectual disability. As discussed in chapter one, while there are some 
similarities and differences, people with congenital deafblindness and those with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities invariably share services and 
issues related to communicating nonsymbolically. In particular, Reinders’ (2002) 

26 
 
assertions are applicable to adults with congenital deafblindness living in 
supported accommodation. While problematic to operationalise, as will be 
discussed later in this chapter, Reinders’ (2002) concept of the good life is 
consistent with the perspectives of a number of scientist practitioners working 
with adults with intellectual disabilities and those with congenital deafblindness.  
 
Johnson, Walmsley and Wolfe, (2010, p. 131) in discussing a good life for all, 
including those with intellectual disabilities, state “fundamentally it is a life lived 
with and for others”. However, these authors go on to argue that public policy 
and the current workforce are ill-equipped to support this ideal for adults with 
intellectual disabilities. These issues will be discussed further in the following 
chapter. 
 
Martens (2007), writing specifically about deafblindness, promotes ideals 
consistent with the good life presented by Reinders (2002). In her examination 
of togetherness with a woman who is deafblind she writes “a life filled with 
pleasure and warm relationships as a result is possible when a person meets 
others and gets involved with them” (Martens, 2007, pp. 24-25). Martens also 
uses Wikipedia's definition of togetherness, which reflects Reinders (2002) 
sentiments, stating it is “the feeling of being close to another person emotionally 
and physically. It makes one feel warm on the inside and creates an altogether 
positive atmosphere for the people involved”.  
 

27 
 
Similarly, and also supporting the idea of the importance of the good life for 
people with congenital deafblindness, Hostyn states:  
especially for persons with congenital deafblindness (CDB), harmonious 
relationships are indispensable for a good quality of life because of their 
dependency on others to explore the world and to develop their own abilities. 
Since the relationships between persons with CDB and their partners are at risk 
for problems, interventions need to address the quality of the relationship itself 
(Hostyn, 2008, p. i). 
 
Human communication development theory lends support to the relevance and 
importance of addressing the need for the experience of social togetherness, or 
the good life, in order for development to occur. Zeedyk (2006) argues “intimacy 
is transformative. It is from emotional intimacy with another person that 
individualistic capacities derive, including self-awareness, representation, 
language, and even consciousness” (Zeedyk, 2006, p. 326). Trevarthen also 
argues the need to acknowledge the mutual regulation between individuals and 
two-way relationships, as this causes goals and processes of regulation which 
when positive, lead to a more effective autonomic state in both individuals 
(Trevarthen, 2005).  
 
This thesis is not necessarily advocating that staff form close personal 
friendships with the adults with congenital deafblindness with whom they work 
in a way that could compromise their professional responsibilities. But it does 
support the view that this human need and human right is operationalised and 
made explicit in their work (cf. McVilly, 2007). Considerably more work is 
required to address ways of achieving this and these are discussed in further 
detail in chapter seven. 
 

28 
 
If we are to apply this concept of the good life to the lives of adults with 
congenital deafblindness to make judgements about the opportunities they are 
given for this desirable mainstream human experience, we need a way to validly 
and reliably measure these. However, before looking at ways of operationalising 
the good life, it is necessary to understand how this concept fits within the 
broader construct of quality of life. 
 
Quality of life 
The focus of this thesis is on interactions between adults with congenital 
deafblindness, disability support workers and scientist practitioners, and the 
impact these interactions have on the quality of life of adults with congenital 
deafblindness. It is therefore necessary to have a broad understanding of the 
construct of quality of life. However, this is a very complex construct which has 
received much attention from researchers. The intention in this thesis is to give 
a broad overview of the construct and highlight some of the key complexities 
and challenges inherent in its measurement. This section will not provide a 
detailed account of the history of the construct or the many and varied tools 
developed to measure it (see Petry & Maes, 2009b). This, albeit brief, reflection 
is important for a number of reasons. The term quality of life is used frequently 
in literature about people with congenital deafblindness. Most research 
investigating 
quality 
of 
life 
enhancing 
interventions, 
however, 
focus 
predominantly on the intervention without contextualising how the intervention 
fits within the quality of life construct.  
 

29 
 
Quantitative measurement of quality of life of persons with intellectual 
disabilities is still a new field. In fact, quality of life measures designed 
specifically for people with intellectual disabilities have only been developed in 
recent years (Schmidt et al., 2010). Thus considerably more work is required to 
determine both the validity and reliability of these measures. There are no 
quality of life measures specifically designed for people with congenital 
deafblindness. The literature drawn upon in this thesis about quality of life 
comes from work with people with intellectual disabilities and, where possible, 
those who communicate nonsymbolically. 
 
Verdugo, Schalock, Keith and Stancliffe (2005) argue two key reasons for the 
importance of measuring quality of life. First, it gives an integral, 
multidimensional view of an individual’s life allowing identification of, and 
planning for, support needs. Or, as Petry and Maes (2009) state, “the main 
purpose of measuring QOL [quality of life] must be to maintain and enhance the 
things that already, or could, add worth to people’s lives and to take action to 
improve the things that currently detract from the quality of people’s lives” (Petry 
& Maes, pp. 25-26). Second, it helps to reorient the focus and activities of public 
organisations and service providers, giving the individual a central role whose 
views and experiences must always be considered. 
 
Use of the term quality of life and the quality of life construct has developed and 
changed over time. Schalock (2004) posits that the quality of life construct 
within the disability context is currently used as a sensitising notion, a unifying 

30 
 
theme and a social construct ultimately to enhance an individual’s wellbeing 
across time and setting. Verdugo et al. (2005) assert that it is also used as a 
criteria for assessing the effectiveness of strategies designed to enhance an 
individual’s quality of life. One such strategy, discussed in more detail in chapter 
three, is Active Support. Jones et al. (1999) argue that deinstitutionalisation 
alone has not satisfactorily enhanced the quality of life of people with severe 
intellectual disabilities. They devised a coding tool to evaluate the impact of 
Active Support on the engagement and interactions of adults with severe 
intellectual disabilities. However, there are issues with measuring quality of life 
enhancing strategies using tools which do not include all quality of life domains.  
Within the functions of the quality of life construct cited above, there is general 
agreement that the construct consists of a number of quality of life domains 
(Felce & Perry, 1995; McVilly & Rawlinson, 1998; Petry, Maes, & Vlaskamp, 
2005; Verdugo et al., 2005). While the nature and number of domains varies 
from author to author, Verdugo et al. (2005) argue:  
the number of domains is less important than the recognition that any proposed 
QOL [quality of life] model must recognise the need for a multi-element 
framework, the realisation that people know what is important to them, and that 
the essential characteristics of any set of domains is that they represent in 
aggregate the complete QOL [quality of life] construct (Verdugo et al., 2005, p. 
709).  
 
These domains are presented more fully in the following section about 
operationalising the good life.  
 
For each domain there are perceptions, behaviours or conditions that are 
considered to be the quality of life indicators for each quality of life domain 
(Schalock, 2004; Verdugo et al., 2005). Again, different authors posit varying 

31 
 
natures and numbers of indicators for each quality of life domain. In particular, 
while domains of quality of life are asserted to be consistent across all people, 
the indicators for different domains appear to vary for people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities relative to those with mild or moderate 
intellectual disabilities (Petry et al., 2005). For example, hygiene, nourishment, 
rest, technical aids and communication were named as important indicators of 
quality of life for people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. 
These indicators are not present in other models of quality of life designed with 
people with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities in mind, or indeed for the 
general population (Petry et al., 2005).  
 
In terms of measurement, multiple authors point out the need for pluralism and 
a cross systems approach (Montisci & Grant, 2010; Petry & Maes, 2009b; 
Schalock, 2004; Schalock et al., 2002). That is, the quality of life of an individual 
needs to be considered at the levels of the different systems and relationships 
within which they operate. These can be micro/individual  (e.g., partners, family 
and friends), meso/organisational (e.g., neighbours, service providers, and local 
community), or macro/societal (e.g., the overarching patterns of society, culture 
and sociopolitical influences) (Montisci & Grant, 2010; Petry & Maes, 2009b; 
Schalock, 2004). Measurement must also include both subjective and objective 
measures, as well as societal indicators (Felce & Perry, 1995; Schalock, 2004). 
 
The quality of life construct within the disability context is clearly a multifaceted, 
complex interconnection of domains and indicators requiring subjective and 

32 
 
objective measurement within the different systems an individual is involved in. 
Montisci and Grant (2010) suggest some other factors which complicate the 
situation further. These include the fact that to date, most research in the area 
of quality of life has involved people with intellectual disabilities who can speak 
and not those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Proxies have 
been used in instances where individuals are unable to self-report. However, 
there are numerous issues around the use of proxies. In addition, most quality 
of life models have for the most part been developed by academics without 
involving those whom the measures will be used with. Montisci and Grant 
(2010) also note that improving services does not necessarily lead to the 
improvement of a service user’s quality of life. These issues are discussed in 
more detail later in this chapter. 
 
This highly abbreviated summary of the key features of the quality of life 
construct provides a theoretical context for the discussion which follows. In 
examining ways in which the good life might be operationalised, rather than 
exploring potential measures of the good life, I will refer to measures of 
opportunities for experiencing the good life. This shifts the focus from the highly 
questionable assumption that someone else’s experiences can be measured, to 
an emphasis on creating an environment which is conducive to certain 
experiences.  
 

33 
 
Operationalising the good life as a domain of quality of life   
As presented above, any model of quality of life must employ a multi-element 
framework which incorporates multiple quality of life domains. There is general 
agreement amongst authors as to what these domains are. Petry et al. (2005) 
adopt the domains described in Felce’s and Perry’s (1995, 1996a, 1996b) 
model. Their (2005) research focuses on people with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. It has more in common with research about adults with 
congenital deafblindness than other research focusing on those with mild and 
moderate intellectual disabilities. The five domains used in Felce’s and Perry’s 
(1995, 1996a, 1996b)  model are:  
physical well being (health, personal safety, fitness, mobility), material well 
being (finance and income, housing quality, transport, security and tenure), 
social well being (personal relationships, community involvement), development 
and activity (competence, productivity and activity), and emotional well being 
(positive affect, fulfilment stress, mental health, self esteem, status and respect, 
faith and belief, sexuality) (Felce & Perry, 1995, p. 53).    
 
These are no different for anyone. “People with PMD [profound multiple 
disabilities] have the same needs as other people with regards to participation, 
relations, choices, competences, and physical and socio-emotional well-being” 
(Petry & Maes, 2007, p. 138). 
 
While social wellbeing is just one of the multiple domains of the quality of life 
construct, it takes on more prominent importance for those with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities, and for those with congenital deafblindness. 
This is because “to gratify their needs on several domains of quality of life they 
need a secure relationship with a sensitive responsive parent and/or direct 
support staff” (Petry et al., 2005, p. 44). This will be explored further in the 

34 
 
following section of this chapter, but for now I will continue to examine how the 
good life might be operationalised as a domain of the quality of life construct.  
 
It seems reasonable to expect that any measure of quality of life which 
addressed the domains of interpersonal relationships and social inclusion, and 
the associated quality of life indicators, would give us some understanding of 
the extent to which an individual has opportunities to experience the good life. 
While some studies do demonstrate enhanced quality of interactions (Chen, 
Klein, & Haney, 2007; Janssen, Riksen-Walraven, & Van Dijk, 2003a), there is 
an implication that this enhances the individual’s quality of life, without using 
any specific measure to evaluate this. As mentioned above, this is one of the 
key critiques of the quality of life construct presented by Montisci and Grant 
(2010).  
 
Inversely, most quality of life measures have only been assessed to determine 
their psychometric properties, that is, their validity and reliability. They have not 
been widely used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions on the individual’s 
quality of life. Furthermore, it is questionable whether they are adequately 
sensitive to detect the changes which may result from an intervention 
specifically focused on enhancing quality interactions, ultimately aiming to 
enhance personal relationships and social inclusion. This is likely due to the 
relatively recent shift in use of the quality of life construct. It is now used as a 
conceptual framework for assessing quality outcomes and a guide for quality 
enhancement strategies, as well as for measuring the efficacy of these 

35 
 
strategies (Verdugo et al., 2005). As the focus with regard to quality of life has 
become more evaluative, it is questionable whether the tools being developed 
to measure it are sensitive enough to detect sometimes subtle but important 
changes resulting from interventions. Certainly more work is required to 
evaluate the current tools’ sensitivity to change resulting from intervention.     
 
Another concern with quality of life measures is their ability to actually measure 
what they purport to measure. “The type of quality of life being measured in a 
study needs to be clearly defined and congruent with the type of quality of life 
measurement tool used, such as generic, health related or disease specific” 
(Sherifali & Pinelli, 2007, p. 95). Maes, Lambrechts, Hostyn and Petry  (2007) 
reviewed studies of quality of life enhancing interventions and highlighted this 
issue. Researchers tend to use a variety of tools to measure the efficacy of 
interventions which they suggest improve quality of life without actually using 
any generic or domain specific quality of life measures.  
 
There appears to be a need for broad, holistic and domain specific quality of life 
measures which address issues relating to particular populations, and take into 
account current trends in public policy. For example, while public policy in many 
countries has helped to improve quality of life in some quality of life domains— 
such as physical and material wellbeing, and safety and security—public policy 
has also moved towards a focus on community or social inclusion. This has 
been interpreted and implemented in a way that has resulted in reduced 
opportunities for social togetherness. This is because of an emphasis on people 

36 
 
accessing local community facilities where there is no one who knows them well 
or how to best interact with them. As Clegg et al. (1991b)  argue, it is possible 
that educational goals have been emphasised to the point of excluding more 
personal goals. Such outcomes appear to be at odds with the good life of 
Reinders (2002) who states “community is the experience of sharing one’s life 
with people” (J. S. Reinders, 2002, p. 2). Community is not a location.  
 
Research indicates that interactions with people who are congenitally deafblind 
are largely lacking in quantity and quality (Preisler, 2005; Vervloed, Van Dijk, 
Knoors, & Van Dijk, 2006). However, there is a paucity of data about how these 
experiences affect people’s quality of life and few tools to gather these data. As 
mentioned earlier, the underlying premise of intervention studies aiming to 
enhance the quality of interactions is that this necessarily improves the 
individual's quality of life; there is little evidence to support this assertion.    
 
One of the greatest issues in assessing quality of life for people with congenital 
deafblindness who are nonsymbolic communicators, and thus cannot self-
report, is the reliance on proxy reports of those who are deemed to know them 
well. The measurement of quality of life necessitates integrating the individual’s 
view of their quality of life. (Schmidt et al., 2010). This creates issues in relation 
to proxy reporting which is problematic for a variety of reasons when applied to 
those who cannot self-report. There is disagreement in the literature around the 
validity of proxy reporting (Petry & Maes, 2009b; Schmidt et al., 2010). Verdugo 
et al. (2005) suggest we can either ignore people who are unable to self-report 

37 
 
or obtain data through proxies which are potentially biased and invalid. 
Cummins (2002) argues there is no evidence to support the use of proxy 
reporting as a valid measure of an individual’s quality of life. He states that a 
person cannot reliably report on the experiences of another when relying on 
indirect cues and personal knowledge because it is not possible for proxies to 
make a disinterested judgement (Cummins, 2002).  
 
However, a number of studies are emerging in which proxy reports have been 
compared with self-reports. Some studies that use measures designed 
specifically for use with people with intellectual disabilities have demonstrated 
moderate to high agreement between individuals and their proxies (McVilly, 
Burton-Smith, & Davidson, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2010). This may give us an 
indication of the validity of some measurement tools used with proxies which 
might be adaptable for use with adults with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities, and those with congenital deafblindness. However, people with 
intellectual disabilities tend to rate their quality of life higher than their proxies 
do. There is also variation between the magnitude of agreement across different 
types of quality of life domains, with higher agreement usually identified in the 
physical rather than in the emotional domain (Schmidt et al., 2010). 
 
Two other strategies are suggested in the literature to improve the validity of 
using proxy measures. One is to employ a mixed method approach which, as 
discussed above, should be employed in any quality of life measure. This 
means the emphasis, when using proxies, shifts from gaining an holistic 

38 
 
perspective, to helping verify the reliability of the proxy reports. An example of 
this is the approach taken by Lyons (2005) in which quantitative observational 
data were paired with proxy reports through interviews to give a measure of life 
satisfaction. The main benefit of this approach is that data are triangulated 
using two different data collection methods, strengthening the findings.  
 
However, there are some limitations to this multimodal approach. Creswell 
(2009) notes three in particular. Considerable expertise is required to study a 
phenomenon using two data collection methods; it is difficult to compare the 
analyses of data which are in different forms; and it is not always clear how to 
resolve discrepancies that appear when comparing the data. In addition, 
Cummins (2002) notes that proxy reports are more likely to be valid if the data 
being collected is of an objective rather than subjective nature, as was the case 
in Lyons’ (2005) study.  
 
The second strategy is to use proxy reports as a complementary perspective 
rather than to replace self-reporting. The complementary perspective reframes 
the issue of who can give the most accurate report. It instead focuses on what 
each person reporting contributes to the overall understanding of the 
individual’s quality of life (Sherifali & Pinelli, 2007). Having a number of people 
who know the individual well report as proxies may enrich this understanding 
(Sherifali & Pinelli, 2007).  
 

39 
 
There is little information in the scientific literature about the experiences of 
people with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. There is even less information about the experiences of 
disability support workers who spend the most time with people with congenital 
deafblindness. It is disability support workers who complete the quality of life 
measures on behalf of the person with deafblindness whom they are deemed to 
know well. Given the key role disability support workers play in mediating the 
experiences of the people with whom they work, and in deciding what 
constitutes a good quality of life for these individuals, there seems value in 
better understanding the worldview of these staff. In so doing, we might better 
understand their perspective as proxy informants on behalf of people with 
congenital deafblindness or profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. This is 
discussed further in chapter four.  
 
Domains of social inclusion: the good life for people with congenital 
deafblindness  
People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities have received 
significantly less attention in the literature on quality of life than their peers with 
moderate and mild intellectual disabilities who are able to self-report. There is 
also a paucity of information about people with congenital deafblindness in this 
literature.  Measuring quality of life for people with congenital deafblindness who 
do not communicate symbolically poses greater challenges due to the need for 
proxy reporting. There are also other differences that require consideration that 
are not well addressed in the quality of life literature.  
 

40 
 
People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities and those with 
congenital deafblindness are often isolated with few social networks, depending 
more heavily on service providers for social interaction. Montisci and Grant 
(2010) argue that disability specific services need to work in close partnership 
with institutions in civil society to build their capacity to include people with 
disabilities. This is because disability specific services meet only a part of their 
need for social contact with others. However, people with profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities, and those with congenital deafblindness, often have 
little or no contact with their families and are unable to interact with the broader 
community without the mediation of service providers. Consequently, the quality 
of services provided by disability organisations largely, if not solely, influences 
the personal relationships and social involvement influencing the quality of life 
of this group of people. In addition, “the communicative and relational aspect 
takes on such a central place in people with PMD [profound and multiple 
disabilities] that it influences all other aspects of functioning” (Petry & Maes, 
2007, p. 139).  
 
It is not surprising that an increasing number of studies are emerging where the 
focus of quality of life measures and quality of life enhancing interventions for 
people with profound and multiple disabilities are on interpersonal relations, the 
first domain established by Petry (2006) (e.g.. Bloomberg, West, & Iacono, 
2003; de Voil, 2000; Firth, .Elforde, Leeming, & Crabbe, 2008; Golden & Reese, 
1996).  The following section focuses on operationalising the good life in terms 
of social interactions and relationships. 

41 
 
Operationalising the good life using features of good quality 
interactions 
The characteristics of good interaction learnt in infancy are applicable to all 
human interactions regardless of age or ability (Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006b).  
Research into human communication development has provided a framework 
with which to evaluate the quality of human interactions. A number of 
researchers in the field of congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual 
and multiple disability are using these features to evaluate the efficacy of 
interventions to enhance quality interactions. Interactions are the building blocks 
upon which relationships are established. We can gain important insights into 
what the good life might look like for adults with congenital deafblindness by 
examining those frameworks and studies which use measurements grounded in 
human communication development theory.  
 
It is well beyond the scope of this thesis to provide an account of the extensive 
research that has been undertaken about the complex processes involved in 
the development of human interaction and communication skills. What is 
presented are a number of frameworks and models grounded in human 
communication development theory. These have been designed by scientist 
practitioners in the pursuit of improving the quality of life of people with 
congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. It should be noted that it is also beyond the scope of this thesis to 
give a thorough account of the development and content of these frameworks. 
Instead, an overview of each is given and I discuss how they have been, or 

42 
 
might be, used to operationalise the good life for people with congenital 
deafblindness within the broader quality of life construct.  
 
As pointed out above, high-quality relationships between people with congenital 
deafblindness and the people who mediate their support are necessary in order 
to achieve good outcomes across a number of quality of life domains, if not all 
of them. For this reason a number of researchers have focused specifically on 
enhancing interactions between people with congenital deafblindness and 
significant others. While these studies aim to improve the individual’s quality of 
life, as mentioned above, it cannot be assumed that improving the quality of 
interactions will necessarily result in improved quality of life. The quality of life 
measures which are currently available may also not be sensitive enough to 
detect changes in interactions and relationships resulting from intervention. The 
frameworks, models and tools examined below have demonstrated efficacy in 
evaluating intervention approaches grounded in human communication 
development theory. There may be value in incorporating such measures into a 
quality of life measure for people with congenital deafblindness or profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. To this end, I have considered five 
frameworks grounded in human communication development theory. This is not 
an exhaustive list and indeed there are numerous tools developed specifically 
for children with deafblindness which could potentially be used as an adjunct to 
a quality of life measure. The tools below have been selected based on their 
current use in professional practice and the evidence of their efficacy in peer 
reviewed literature.  

43 
 
The first four have been designed specifically for use with people with 
congenital deafblindness, and the first three were designed for use with 
children. 
 
The Developmental Profile was developed by Nafstad and Rodbroe (1999). 
“The developmental profile is the name of a map of markers which includes 
cues which can support intuitive competence in interaction and communication” 
(Nafstad & Rodbroe, 1999, p. 49). This framework builds on the premise that 
intuitive competence alone is inadequate to foster quality interactions and 
relationships for people with congenital deafblindness.  
 
The Developmental Profile was born out of the Co-creating Communication 
approach and contains “cues for categorised video analysis” in terms of social 
interaction, proximity, exploration and communicative expressions. The aim of 
the tool is to improve the quality of interaction and communication between a 
person with deafblindness and their communication partner.  
 
While considerable work went into developing The Developmental Profile and it 
is reportedly “in frequent use” (Ehrlich, 2007), there is limited evidence of its use 
as a measurement tool in the literature. There is, however, one study that is 
particularly useful and relevant to this thesis. It involves the use of The 
Developmental Profile with an adult with congenital deafblindness in a 
residential setting. Ehrlich’s (2007) study highlights some key issues around 
using The Developmental Profile in this setting. Given the dearth of information 

44 
 
about appropriate tools to evaluate communicative skills in adults with 
congenital deafblindness, the findings of Ehrlich’s (2007) study are valuable, 
particularly the benefits and limitations of using The Developmental Profile.  
 
One benefit of The Developmental Profile was that it was possible to use the 
tool designed for children in an adult setting and develop an intervention plan 
based on the results. The participant with deafblindness in Ehrlich’s (2007) 
study was found to have more cognitive skills than he was able to demonstrate 
through communicative capabilities as some low-functioning cues were no 
longer observed. This led Ehrlich to suggest that “the experiences of adults 
seem to play a crucial role in the difference of the use of The Developmental 
Profile with children and with adults” (Ehrlich, 2007, p. 57). Using The 
Developmental Profile in a different context highlighted some differences 
between children and adults with congenital deafblindness. (These are 
elaborated on at the end of this chapter.) However, Ehrlich (2007) also raises a 
number of difficulties and limitations associated with this tool. 
 
Difficulty in understanding the meaning of the cues and accomplishing the 
profile is reported due to the simple illustrations and lack of clear assessment 
questions. Recognising the cues and the way in which video sequences might 
be analysed is dependent on how the assessor understands the cues and how 
the interaction partner creates the profile result. This tool also requires a broad 
theoretical knowledge, as well as personal knowledge of the adult with 
congenital deafblindness. A further issue is the amount of time required for the 

45 
 
whole process. This need for a thorough knowledge of the theory underpinning 
the measurement tool as well as personal knowledge of the individual being 
assessed is of key importance. Many of the tools available require the person 
administering them to interpret the behaviours of an individual to fit within a set 
of predetermined codes or types of behaviour. Typically it is scientist 
practitioners who administer the evaluations. This is despite the fact that 
disability support workers who support the individual are likely to have a greater 
understanding of the nature of their behaviours. However, these staff will often 
have an inadequate understanding of the theoretical background to the tool 
and, as a result, the nature of the codes. This issue is examined further in 
chapter seven.  
 
Ehrlich (2007) states “during my investigations I continuously recognised the 
gap between dedicated attention to an individual’s needs and the fulfilment of 
organizational and financial requirements” (Ehrlich, 2007, p. 5). These issues 
have not been well addressed in the pursuit of interventions which will have 
sustainable positive outcomes for adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 
Given these challenges, Ehrlich (2007) suggests the following to improve The 
Developmental Profile for use with adults: the reiteration of the cues into 
assessment questions, which contain observable behaviour; inclusion of 
consideration of an adult’s life experiences within the interpretation of the 
results; and that theoretical knowledge is imparted to caregivers in a concise, 
easy and efficient way. 

46 
 
 
While there are clearly some issues associated with using The Developmental 
Profile, particularly with adults, it is a way to measure and evaluate the building 
blocks of interaction upon which the good life is built. Ehrlich’s (2007) suggested 
recommendations when using the tool with adults could also improve its use 
with this population. Ehrlich’s (2007) insights might also be applied to other 
tools predominantly used with children as her study is one of the few that raises 
issues relevant to work with adults. Her recommendations will be considered 
further in chapter seven which examines the best options for evaluating 
strategies for enhancing opportunities to experience the good life.   
 
The second framework considered is the set of categories of interactive 
behaviour used with the intervention approach CONTACT. This approach was 
developed and implemented by Janssen et al. (2003a). It was designed to 
evaluate the efficacy of intervention aimed at fostering harmonious interactions 
and relationships between children with deafblindness and their educators.   
 
The evaluation tool is made up of eight categories of behaviour which are coded 
for both children and their educators. The categories of behaviour are:  
1.  Initiatives; starting an interaction or bringing up something new as part of 
an answer,  
2.  Confirmations; clear acknowledgement that an initiative has been noticed 
and recognised,  
3.  Answers; positive (approving) or negative (disapproving) reactions to the 
partners utterance,  
4.  Turns; turn taking or becoming the actor and turn giving, or allowing the 
other to become the actor,  
5.  Attention; focusing on the partner, the content of the interaction or the 
individuals and / or the objects within the interaction context,  

47 
 
6.  Regulation of intensity of the interaction – for the educator: waiting while 
the child regulates the intensity of the interaction and for the child: 
appropriate regulation (e.g., turning his or her head away or laying a hand 
on the partner’s hand) – and inappropriate regulation (e.g., self abusive or 
aggressive behaviour), 
7.  Affective involvement; mutual sharing of emotions and  
8.   Independent acting – for the educator: acting while not focusing on the child 
and for the child: executing actions independently (e.g., putting on a 
garment or part of a garment) (Janssen et al., 2003a, p. 218). 
 
The process which incorporates the coding of these eight behaviour categories 
is as follows. Intervention goals are developed in collaboration with the child’s 
care givers and educators. These intervention goals are presented as three or 
four aims and are translated in terms of the eight core categories of interactive 
behaviour presented above. For example, within a given activity intervention 
goals might be: turn giving more often, affective involvement more often, 
initiatives less often. Intervention focuses on changing educator behaviours in 
order to address the intervention goals. Video analysis and coaching occurs 
with individual educators and groups of educators in order to change their 
behaviours.  
 
This tool is of potential value in operationalising and measuring possible 
opportunities for experiencing the good life for a number of reasons. Given its 
developmental orientation, it is equally applicable to adults as it is to children. 
This is because the targeted increase in positive behaviours and decrease in 
negative behaviours are selected based on the level at which the individual is 
currently operating. There is also flexibility in this model to focus on behaviours 
and activities specific to individuals and locations, making it applicable for use 
with adults. In addition, the tool has demonstrated interrater reliability and has 

48 
 
been used to demonstrate the efficacy of intervention. However, to date it has 
only been used with children in child specific settings, so some questions 
remain about its application to adults with congenital deafblindness in adult 
specific settings.  
  
The issue raised by Ehrlich (2007) about the requirement of the observer using 
the coding tool to have a good understanding of the theoretical background of 
the tool is also applicable here. The CONTACT intervention approach would 
largely preclude disability support workers from being the observers, despite the 
fact that they have the best personal knowledge of the individual with 
deafblindness, thus denying the input of this valuable knowledge in the process. 
 
The third framework considered is the Promoting Learning through Active 
Interaction (PLAI) curriculum developed by Chen et al. (2007). As with the 
previous two frameworks, this also has been designed specifically for children 
rather than adults. The curriculum draws upon research on infant development, 
early intervention, severe disability and deafblindness. 
 
PLAI consists of six key components: a communication interview to be 
conducted with the primary care giver of the child, and five modules with goals, 
objectives and activities for each. The five modules are: understanding child 
cues, 
identifying 
child 
preferences, 
establishing 
predictable 
routines, 
establishing turn taking, and encouraging communicative initiations (Chen et al., 
2007, p. 151). 

49 
 
 
Chen et al. (2007) do not use the curriculum itself as a tool to measure its own 
efficacy. Nevertheless, the curriculum itself requires the observation and 
documentation of a variety of key observable events and behaviours. These 
include behaviour states, the child’s typical reaction to events and activities, and 
identification of activities to be carried out in the same sequence each day. All 
of these observable events and behaviours could potentially form measures of 
opportunities to experience the good life. 
 
The measurement tools used to evaluate the efficacy of the PLAI curriculum 
were analysis of video recorded interactions before and at various points during 
the implementation of the curriculum, and pre- and post-implementation care 
giver questionnaires. The key criteria for analysis in both the videos and 
questionnaires were frequency and type of anticipatory sensory cues given by 
care givers. A significant increase in the frequency and type of cues given by 
care givers was observed using both the video analysis and care giver 
questionnaires following implementation of the curriculum. High interrater 
reliability was achieved between the two raters who coded the videos. This is a 
positive finding. As stated above the curriculum has the potential to track the 
change and development of a variety of key behaviours over time, beyond 
anticipatory sensory cues presented by care givers. However, as with the 
categories of interactive behaviour coded in the CONTACT approach, the PLAI 
curriculum has only been trialled with children. This leaves questions around its 
applicability to adults with congenital deafblindness.  

50 
 
 
The fourth framework considered is the set of guidelines developed by Rodbroe 
and Janssen (2006b). This is the only framework presented here which has not 
been used specifically to assist in documenting or evaluating an individual’s 
current status or change in behaviours over time. The key features of Rodbroe 
and Janssen’s (2006) guidelines for high-quality dyadic interaction are:  
1a. Attunement: being aware of the child’s feelings and needs and responding 
to them promptly and effectively, 
1b  Co-regulation: continual and mutual adaptation process in which adult and 
child dynamically alter their actions in relation to the ongoing and 
anticipated actions of their partner,   
2.  Reciprocity: social interaction involving mutual exchanges,  
3.  Turn taking: exchanging turns between two partners,  
4.   Mutual attention and proximity: when partners are oriented on and directed 
to each other and the theme in their dyadic interactions, 
5.  Rhythm and tempo: communicative musicality which organises and 
regulates shared rhythms and pitch in vocalisations, 
6.  Novelty and processing: novel stimuli from the communication partner, the 
environment or inside the body which requires processing and triggers an 
orienting response (Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006b).  
 
The DVD accompanying the booklet in which the guidelines are described, 
clearly shows that each of these features is observable and potentially 
measurable. However, additional work is required to develop and test a tool 
incorporating these features of high-quality interaction and its applicability with 
both children and adults.   
 
Certainly a number of authors have demonstrated ways in which some of these 
key features can be documented or evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. 
For example, Forster (2011) demonstrates it is possible to identify and quantify 
the duration of affect attunement observed in disability support workers 
interacting with adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Both 

51 
 
Chen et al. (2007) and Janssen et al. (2003a), incorporate turn taking behaviour 
as a key feature of interaction to be evaluated. Chen et al, (2007) do this 
qualitatively as part of the PLAI curriculum and Janssen et al. (2003) include it 
as a quantifiable measure of the efficacy of intervention.  
 
The key features of high-quality interactions set out by Rodbroe and Janssen 
(2006) are often subtle, complex, interrelated behaviours. These provide a 
sound framework grounded in human communication development theory with 
which to operationalise and evaluate the essential precursors to experiencing 
the good life.  
 
The final tool considered as a potential means for measuring opportunities to 
experience the good life is the Scale for Dialogical Meaning Making (S-DMM) 
(Hostyn et al., 2009). It is applicable to the evaluation of any one-to-one human 
interaction. The S-DMM was developed by scientist practitioners with 
experience with people with congenital deafblindness or profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities. The authors provide key considerations when using the 
tool with these populations. The tool has a strong theoretical background 
emphasising and acknowledging the asymmetrical and dynamic process of 
creating meaning when two people are in dialogue. One of the strengths of this 
tool, distinguishing it from others, is that it evaluates the process of the two 
people in interaction. It does not focus on the individuals within the process, but 
rather what occurs between them. It is the quality of this process which 
determines the degree to which an individual may experience the good life, that 

52 
 
is, the sense of togetherness within the relationship. The tool has five 
subscales: mutual openness, joint embedding context, non-manipulative 
negotiating, joint confirmation, and non-evaluativeness.  
 
To use the scale at least two observers, who have done in depth training to 
understand the theoretical concepts underpinning the scale, watch a video 
segment of two people in interaction or dialogue in a familiar situation. Once 
observers are achieving at least 70% agreement with other observers on 
practice videos, they are ready to rate actual videos. The S-DMM uses a 
consensus coding approach involving dialogue between the two observers to 
reach agreement about the ratings. However, interrater reliability can still be 
calculated by each observer prior to the consensus rating procedure. This is a 
key advantage of this tool. It creates an opportunity to test agreement between 
observers, but not at the expense of gaining greater insight into the processes 
involved in the interaction between the two in the video being rated.  
 
One of the limitations of the S-DMM, as with all the tools discussed in this 
section, is the need for those using these tools to have a sound knowledge of 
the theory underpinning the tool. Interestingly, Hostyn et al. (2009) state there 
would be value in the interaction partner of the person with a disability being 
one of the observers. However, it would take considerable time to train them in 
the concepts and constructs evaluated by the tool. This issue is examined 
further in chapter seven. 
 

53 
 
It is important to note that each of the five frameworks considered have arisen 
from, and employ the use of, video analysis within their development and 
implementation. This highlights the value and necessity of the use of video to 
analyse interactions with the aim of better understanding what is occurring in 
these complex, nonverbal, nonsymbolic exchanges.  
 
Each of these frameworks also has a strong emphasis on the key features of 
quality interaction which are documented in the literature on human 
communication development. These key features of quality interactions are 
included in measures of the efficacy of interventions. While these intervention 
approaches have been found to be effective (Chen et al., 2007; Janssen et al., 
2003a) and to endure to some extent (Janssen, Riksen-Walraven, & van Dijk, 
2004), there is no research into their efficacy in adult residential services for 
people with congenital deafblindness. In addition, they are limited in their scope 
and do not contemplate some of the issues raised by Ehrlich (2007), such as 
balancing the needs of individuals and those of the employing organisation, 
which will impact on the nature of interactions.  
 
The intervention approaches described by Janssen et al. (2003a) and Chen et 
al. (2007) are developmentally oriented, strengths-based models which could 
potentially be used in adult services. However, there are a number of other 
issues in adult services which are not well addressed in the literature. To 
achieve enduring, long-term, positive outcomes for adults with congenital 
deafblindness, these issues need to be addressed prior to initiating 

54 
 
interventions previously used successfully with children with congenital 
deafblindness.   
 
In presenting ways in which the good life can be operationalised using the 
quality of life construct and human communication development theory it is 
apparent that a number of key issues are not addressed in the literature. As 
discussed above, a strong emphasis on the pivotal quality of life domains of 
social interaction and personal relationships is justified. Yet these domains are 
interconnected with, and will influence and be influenced by, other quality of life 
domains. For this reason, it is erroneous to claim a person’s quality of life has 
been improved due to a positive change in their interactions if only tools which 
focus on interactions are used. However, as stated earlier, it is not clear 
whether quality of life measures will be sensitive enough to detect the subtle 
changes resulting from intervention. I therefore argue that an approach is 
required that uses both the broad quality of life construct together with a method 
specifically designed to evaluate interaction. Only by combining these two ways 
of operationalising the good life can we learn more about the strengths and 
limitations of the tools currently available to measure the impact of interventions 
designed to enhance opportunities for adults with congenital deafblindness to 
experience the good life.  
 
The remainder of this chapter highlights a number of other issues not well 
addressed in the literature about the experiences of adults with congenital 

55 
 
deafblindness. These also require consideration in determining the most useful 
evaluation strategies.   
 
What is currently known about interactions with people with 
congenital deafblindness  
Now that some potential ways to operationalise and measure opportunities for 
experiencing the good life have been explored, past and current tools and 
methods used to study the situation of people with congenital deafblindness will 
be examined. An historical perspective is provided to situate current research in 
the context that has shaped thinking in this area. The history of services and 
intervention in the field of congenital deafblindness is also relevant. Due to the 
lag between research and practice, some outdated thinking still pervades 
current practices.  
Historical perspective  
Apart from being a low incidence disability, another reason why so little is 
known about the experiences of people with congenital deafblindness is that 
there are no records of people with congenital deafblindness prior to the 1950s. 
Before then only children who acquired deafblindness, such as Helen Keller, 
were educated (Enerstvedt, 1996). Up until the 1980s the primary goal of 
educators of children with deafblindness was to teach them symbolic 
communication skills. These resembled those of sighted and hearing people, 
such as sign language and use of pictures and objects (Hart, 2006). This 
emphasis on symbolism of the dominant culture remains strong in the disability 
sector in Australia. It is still common to read recommendations in 

56 
 
communication assessments which focus on the use of symbols rather than on 
the more interactive approaches which are emerging from the research 
literature.   
 
After years of very limited success in teaching children with deafblindness to 
express themselves using symbols of the dominant culture, and with the 
development of technology to video record human interactions, scientist 
practitioners began to look at human communication development in a new 
way. Van Dijk (1966) raised the issue that inadequate attention was paid to the 
developmental stages before symbolism as early as 1966. But it was not until 
the late 1980s that publications about nonsymbolic communication were 
produced. These included a pamphlet on Augmented Mothering (the original 
name given to Intensive Interaction) (Caldwell (2006), and Siegel–Causey’s and 
Guess’ (1989) book on nonsymbolic communication. In the 1990s Nind and 
Hewett described and expanded on an approach they named Intensive 
Interaction (Nind & Hewett, 1994). Nafstad and Rodbroe proposed a Co-
creating Communication framework to better understand optimal conditions for 
developing the communication skills of people with congenital deafblindness 
(Nafstad & Rodbroe, 1999) (mentioned above). Chen and Haney (1995) also 
published an early intervention model for children who are deafblind. It drew on 
the principles of contingent responding and mutual, reciprocal and pleasurable 
interactions described in the infant development literature.  
 

57 
 
Daelman, Nafstad, and Rodbroe (1993), and Preisler (2005) point out that what 
is basic developmentally seems to remain basic throughout life. This means 
research on early human development is very useful for scientist practitioners 
working with people with developmental disabilities. However, despite the call to 
increase the emphasis on developmentally appropriate communication and 
intervention informed by developmental theory, outdated thinking about age 
appropriateness (cf. Forster, 2010) and the principles of normalisation theory 
(cf. Wolfensberger, 2000) persist.  
 
As mentioned above, there is some lag in evidence-based research being 
implemented in practice. The current trend in intervention with people with 
congenital deafblindness has shifted from an emphasis on symbolism to more 
developmentally oriented interactive approaches grounded in theory on human 
communication development. Given this, what do we know about what is 
currently occurring for adults with congenital deafblindness in their adult–adult 
interactions?  
 
What is currently known about interactions with adults with congenital 
deafblindness?  
Very few studies investigate interactions with adults with congenital 
deafblindness; most of those that do are single case designs. Despite some 
methodological limitations, including in being able to generalise findings, these 
studies help reveal the issues facing adults with congenital deafblindness and 
their communication partners relative to those of children. The following is a 
brief summary and analysis of some of these studies.   

58 
 
 
Similar to studies of child–parent and child–educator interactions, Romer and 
Shoenberg (1991) found staff initiated by far the majority of interactions, that 
these interactions were infrequent and brief in duration, and that opportunities 
for interaction were missed by staff. Their study is one of the very few which 
investigates interactions between staff and residents of a residential service 
specifically for people with deafblindness.  
 
Ehrlich (2007), Hart (2001), and Nyling (2003) all look at interactions with just 
one adult with congenital deafblindness. Ehrlich (2007) and Hart (2001) with just 
one communication partner, and Nyling (2003) with a staff team. While all had a 
slightly different focus in their research aims, each consistently states the 
importance of sustained interactions with skilled partners and the staff’s 
familiarity with the adults and their communicative behaviours. This is consistent 
with Reinders’ (2010) assertion that a high-quality relationship between staff 
and client is imperative for professional knowledge. Of particular interest is 
Ehlich’s (2007) observation about the tension between staff meeting the needs 
of the individual while at the same time meeting those of the organisation for 
which they work. This was also noted by Forster and Iacono (2008). The 
broader issues which influence staff and their relationships with the people they 
support are not well understood or documented, and require investigation to 
better understand staff behaviours.  
 

59 
 
Ehrlich (2007), Hart (2001) and Nyling (2003) all raise issues specific to working 
with adults with congenital deafblindness. These include the challenge for staff 
to work in a developmentally appropriate way in light of the shift in emphasis 
away from age appropriateness in interactions (cf. Forster, 2010). Working with 
adults who have become passive due to extinction of earlier communicative 
behaviours from lack of experience and opportunities to learn and develop 
these skills is also a problem. These potential issues must be taken into 
account if an intervention approach applied to children with congenital 
deafblindness is to be extrapolated to an adult setting.  
 
What is currently known about interactions with children with congenital 
deafblindness?  
Nafsted and Rodbroe (1999), Chen and Haney (1995), Chen et al. (2007), 
Janssen et al. (2003a), Senses Foundation (2000), and Hart (2006) all offer 
strategies and techniques for interacting with people with congenital 
deafblindness in a way most likely to foster and enhance opportunities for high-
quality interactions, or the good life. All of these authors have drawn on the 
work of researchers in the field of human communication development, 
including the frameworks discussed above. 
 
There is now growing agreement about the need for interventions aimed at 
enhancing 
communicative 
interactions 
with 
people 
with 
congenital 
deafblindness. The elements of these interventions include attunement, 
contingent responding, mutuality and reciprocity. Current researchers are 
discovering that these elements are lacking in the interactions with people with 

60 
 
congenital deafblindness (see Hart, 2010; Preisler, 2005; Romer & Schoenberg, 
1991; Vervloed et al., 2006).  
 
Nevertheless, the predominant assumption that underpins intervention studies 
with people with deafblindness is that interactions will be improved and 
enhanced by training the interaction partner/s of the person with deafblindness. 
They do not consider the broader social framework within which the interactions 
are occurring. They also assume that addressing the knowledge and skills of 
the communication partner is the key to changing the interaction. Studies 
investigating interactions with people with congenital deafblindness are 
increasingly taking into account the social validity of the research, that is, the 
willingness of participants to be involved and the need to involve participants in 
setting goals (e.g., Janssen et al., 2003a). However, there is an underlying 
assumption that the participants agree there is a problem that needs solving. 
Willingly being involved in research and enjoying the process does not 
inherently imply that the participants agreed there was a problem to begin with, 
or that they fully agree with the solution they are being taught.  
 
Differences for adults with congenital deafblindness  
The majority of studies in this area have involved children and adolescents with 
deafblindness. Some authors report that the strategies and techniques used 
with children who are deafblind are equally applicable to adults with congenital 
deafblindness (e.g., Daelman et al., 2004; Nafstad & Rodbroe, 1997, 1999; 
Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006b; Senses Foundation, 2000). While the strategies 

61 
 
and approaches these authors suggest may be relevant and applicable to 
adults with congenital deafblindness, there are a number of factors which make 
the situation for adults with congenital deafblindness different from that of 
children with congenital deafblindness. These are discussed below. It is 
important to consider these differences before applying the communication 
principles used with children to maximise the potential for sustainable positive 
outcomes.  
 
There may be potential differences in the expectations of the communication 
partners of children and adults. Certainly more rapid development resulting from 
intervention with children might be expected compared to adults due to 
maturation effects. However, it is also likely that previously learnt skills may be 
uncovered when working with adults with congenital deafblindness. Ehrlich 
(2007) acknowledges that it may be the case with adults who are deafblind that 
low-functioning cues get lost and are not seen anymore, probably due to 
deprivation caused by nonappropriate support in the past. These potential 
differences in the expectations of communication partners are not well 
addressed or documented in the literature and require further investigation.  
 
Nyling (2003) notes that children with congenital deafblindness are often more 
inspiring as many of the adults tend to be rather passive due to their lack of 
experiences 
with 
interaction. 
Nyling 
(2003) 
also 
acknowledges 
that 
communication partners’ intuition in interaction and communication is less 
reliable with adults with congenital deafblindness. It may easily become affected 

62 
 
by the discrepancy between developmental age and chronological age. This 
assertion of Nyling’s (2003) seems well founded and reasonable. However, 
there is little evidence in the research available to support it. As mentioned 
above, prevailing attitudes about normalisation and age appropriateness may 
influence service providers’ behaviours. Unfortunately there is a dearth of 
information to inform us about what actually does influence the behaviour of 
interaction partners of people with congenital deafblindness. Like Nyling (2003) 
we can make well informed, reasonable guesses, but this is not sufficient to 
guide practice. Considerably more work is required to better understand what 
influences the behaviours of communication partners to best influence these 
behaviours for positive outcomes in interaction.  
 
Janssen (2009) points out some of the additional challenges facing the 
interaction partners of adults with congenital deafblindness as substantial 
challenging behaviours and passivity. Again, there is no research in the field of 
deafblindness which helps us to understand how these behaviours in adults 
influence their interactions with others. 
 
A final but important difference between the interactions of children with 
congenital deafblindness and those of adults with congenital deafblindness is 
the nature of their interaction partners. In investigating the good life and how it 
might be operationalised for adults with congenital deafblindness, it is of key 
importance to gain a greater understanding of what is currently occurring for 
them in interactions with others. It is common for adults with profound 

63 
 
intellectual and multiple disabilities to have little or no contact with their families. 
For many, disability support workers are the people with whom they interact 
most (Forster & Iacono, 2008; Golden & Reese, 1996; McVilly & Parmenter, 
2006). While there is less evidence available to support the case that adults 
with congenital deafblindness also have limited interaction with people other 
than disability support workers, they do form a subgroup of people with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (Meuwese-Jongejeugd et al., 
2008). Others who do not have a profound intellectual disability still share 
services and experience similarities in communication issues impacting on 
relationships with others.  
 
While strategies used with children with congenital deafblindness are often 
applicable to adults with congenital deafblindness, the staff working in adult 
disability settings are rarely adequately trained in the use of these. Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that adults with congenital deafblindness often lose, or stop 
using, communication skills they learnt at school when they move to community 
residential units and day services. This is because few staff are familiar with 
sign language and even fewer with tactile signing methods. It would also be 
expected that parents and educators have much more interest, motivation and 
training in responding to children with congenital deafblindness than the 
disability support workers in residential and day program settings who are the 
primary communication partners of adults with congenital deafblindness. In 
Australia most states have specific services for children with deafblindness; 
these services are less common for adults (M. Prain, 2005; Ward, 1994). 

64 
 
 
Given that disability support workers are in many cases the primary interaction 
partners of adults with congenital deafblindness, they will to a large extent, if not 
solely, be the mediators of these adults’ experience of the good life. For this 
reason, their reports on what occurs during their interactions with adults with 
congenital deafblindness is of vital importance. This perspective departs from 
dominant methodologies in investigating interactions with this group. The 
possible effects of the different dynamics inherent in these relationships are yet 
to be investigated (Parker, Davidson, & Banda, 2007).  
 
This chapter has focused on the relationship between scientist practitioners and 
people with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. The chapter examined the theory underpinning current 
intervention approaches and gaps which remain in our understanding of the 
situation for adults with congenital deafblindness.  
The following chapter looks at what is understood about staff–client interactions 
and the perspectives of the staff who work with people who communicate 
nonsymbolically. It highlights what is known to be working well in enhancing 
staff–client interactions to optimise opportunities to experience the good life, as 
well as some limitations and areas which require further investigation.  
Ehrlich (2007) states “during my investigations I continuously recognised the 
gap between dedicated attention to an individual’s needs and the fulfilment of 
organizational and financial requirements” (Ehrlich, 2007, p. 5). These issues 
are discussed further in the following chapter and in chapter seven.  

65 
 
Chapter Three: Disability support workers  
 
As has already been established, one of the key differences between children 
and adults with congenital deafblindness is the nature of their primary 
communication partners: parents and educators for children, and disability 
support workers for adults. Given the very limited research investigating 
interactions between disability support workers and adults with congenital 
deafblindness, we can gain important and relevant information from the 
literature on interactions between disability support workers and adults with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. As noted in chapter one, in 
Australia often the same organisations and staff provide services to both adults 
with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities (M. Prain, 2005; Ward, 1994). Similar issues, such as missed 
opportunities for communication, low and infrequent levels of interaction (e.g., 
Finlay, Antaki, Walton, & Stribling, 2008; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991), and high 
staff turnover (Hall & Hall, 2002; Hewitt & Larsen, 2007) are experienced by 
both populations.  
 
This chapter focuses on the relationships, or more specifically the interactions, 
which form the basis of relating between people who communicate 
nonsymbolically and the disability support workers who mediate their support. It 
also explores the relationship between scientist practitioners and disability 
support workers, in particular, how scientist practitioners have come to 
understand the situation for disability support workers. 
 

66 
 
Current understandings about interactions between disability support workers 
and adults who communicate through nonsymbolic means are discussed. In 
particular, how this information has been generated. Most of the literature in this 
field arises from the premise that there is a problem with the nature of the 
interactions between staff and clients, so generally the literature consists of 
intervention studies aimed at improving staff–client interactions. This 
information will help determine what strategies have proven most effective in 
enhancing opportunities to experience the good life and the limitations of these 
interventions. 
 
The chapter also examines how the efficacy and outcomes of these 
interventions have been measured. The majority of research in this field has 
been largely directed from the perspective of scientist practitioners. The chapter 
concludes by exploring what is currently known about the perspectives of 
disability support workers on their interactions with adults with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. These perspectives might help develop our 
understanding of the best way to enhance opportunities for nonsymbolic 
communicators to experience the good life and how best to evaluate these.  
 
What is currently known about interactions and how has this 
knowledge been generated?  
In order to pursue opportunities for adults with congenital deafblindness to 
experience the good life there is value in examining strategies which have been 
trialled with people who also communicate nonsymbolically. The efficacy of 
these interventions also needs to be examined. This will assist in determining 

67 
 
the key features of interventions which might be applied to the situation for 
adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 
In an attempt to address the apparent mismatch between staff–client 
communication and the associated low levels and poor quality of client 
engagement in meaningful and rewarding activity, the efficacy of a variety of 
intervention approaches, used over the past three decades, has been 
investigated. As noted in the previous chapter, it was not until the 1980s that 
more developmentally oriented approaches to intervention were introduced. 
What follows is a summary of the research investigating different staff training 
and development foci, and models aimed at enhancing improved interactions 
between staff and people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
Methodological issues and gaps in current knowledge are highlighted. These 
findings are then discussed in terms of what we know and what we need to 
know in order to provide quality support to adults with congenital deafblindness. 
It must be noted that the following is not an exhaustive list of intervention 
strategies used with adults who communicate nonsymbolically and there is an 
emphasis on evidence based practices currently being employed in Victoria, 
Australia  
  
Overview of intervention strategies 
Participative management, supervision, observational approaches and training 
Studies dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s demonstrate recognition 
by scientist practitioners of the need to involve disability support workers in the 
formulation of intervention processes. Burgio, Whitman and Reid (1983) and 

68 
 
Rasing and Duker (1992) used a participative management model in which staff 
set their own intervention goals. In the study conducted by Burgio et al. (1983) 
staff rated themselves on the achievement of their goals. This approach was 
found to be effective in increasing staff–client interactions, reducing 
inappropriate client behaviours, and was viewed as acceptable to staff. Like 
many intervention studies, this study provided no information about the 
endurance or sustainability of these intervention effects. While the authors 
report that this approach was acceptable to staff, the investigation was initiated 
by scientist practitioners rather than disability support workers. It is unclear what 
the staff’s perception of the situation was prior to the intervention. This indeed is 
true for all the intervention studies reviewed here and is discussed later in the 
chapter. It should be noted that in both these studies the participants with 
disabilities were children. Nevertheless, the studies are of relevance in so far as 
the staff who participated were residential care workers.  
 
Specific approaches to the supervision of staff have also been found to be 
effective in changing staff behaviour. Seys and Duker (1986) did not involve 
staff to the same level as Burgio et al. (1983) and Rasing and Duker (1992). 
Seys and Duker (1986) found increased staff–client interactions through the use 
of a targeted supervision approach. Dyer, Schwartz and Luce (1984) adopted a 
similar supervision approach to increasing age appropriateness of client 
activities. They found a pyramidal supervision approach to be effective in terms 
of cost and in changing staff behaviour. However, this study did not address the 
endurance or sustainability of the approach. Nevertheless, there is value in 

69 
 
looking at the intervention process in this instance rather than the intervention 
goal.   
 
Another limitation of these studies, as Seys and Duker (1986) point out, is that  
there was no measure or evidence of changes to client outcomes resulting from 
the changed staff behaviour. Van Oorsouw, Embregts, Bosman and Jahoda 
(2009) reviewed studies involving staff training. They found that it was more 
common to measure changes in staff behaviours than changes in client 
behaviours. This raises concerns about these evaluation tools given these 
interventions aim to impact positively on at least some domains of the clients’ 
quality of life.  
 
Some studies evaluate changes to both staff and client behaviours. They give a 
better indication of whether changes in staff behaviour have an impact on the 
clients, and if so in what way. Clegg et al. (1991a; 1991b) examine the effects 
on client behaviour resulting from changing staff behaviour. The intervention 
applied asked staff to spend 10 minutes in interaction with one client. Clegg et 
al. (1991a) found that people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
responded positively to being talked to about one third of the time. Their most 
likely response to being talked to was neutral or a lack of response. Correlations 
have been found between habituation and the frequency at which mothers 
touched and looked at their child (Riksen-Walraven, 1978). This could help 
explain the low level of client response in the study done by Clegg et al. 
(1991a), but this requires further investigation. Clegg et al. (1991b) coded staff 

70 
 
and client behaviours during the application of a variety of interaction strategies. 
They found the most frequent positive client responses occurred in response to 
being talked to and social games.  
 
Most 
research 
about 
interactions 
between 
adults 
who 
communicate 
symbolically and the staff who support them evaluates the efficacy of different 
intervention strategies. There are some studies, though, that are more 
exploratory in nature. For example, Duker et al. (1989) looked at the impact of 
client behaviours on staff behaviours and some correlations were found. Based 
on their findings, Duker et al. (1989) recommended that intervention should 
focus on increasing ambulatory and looking behaviours, and decreasing 
stereotypic behaviours in clients in order to improve staff responses.  
 
Their study highlights the marked shift in the philosophy underpinning work with 
people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities which has occurred 
over the past 20 years. Duker et al. (1989) recommended interventions which 
would make the clients more appealing to staff by, for example, reducing 
stereotypic behaviours. In contrast, the current interactive and dialogical 
approaches value and respect any behaviours as potential bases for interaction 
and points of connection. However, as mentioned earlier, there is value in being 
aware of past attitudes and approaches to intervention. Due to lags between 
research and practice, these attitudes and practices often persist.    
 

71 
 
Many intervention studies aimed at enhancing the quality of life of adults who 
communicate nonsymbolically involve some degree of training for the staff who 
support these adults. However, there remains limited evidence that training 
alone improves staff performance. It is also not yet clear what the key elements 
of effective training are. Van Oorsouw, Embregts, Bosman and Jahoda (2009), 
in their meta-analysis of training for staff working with people with intellectual 
disabilities, provide valuable insights and considerations for running effective 
training. These include: a) in-service training combined with on-the-job coaching 
is more effective than either one in isolation; b) in-service training should vary in 
technique, for example, providing literature, instruction, video demonstration 
and modelling; and c) verbal feedback is important to achieve better outcomes 
both for in-service training and on-the-job coaching. They also note there is a 
lack of clarity around how best to evaluate the efficacy of training. Currently, 
mostly client outcome variables are measured rather than long-term staff 
behaviour change. This highlights a change from other studies discussed in this 
chapter which focused more heavily on staff behaviours than client behaviours 
in their evaluations. Based on what has been presented, clearly an optimal 
evaluation would include both, and address the sustainability of the outcomes.    
 
Of key relevance to this investigation are two intervention approaches that 
typically evaluate both staff and client behaviours in their outcome measures. 
These two systematic, evidence-based approaches to increasing client 
engagement and interactions between clients and staff are Active Support and 
Intensive Interaction. These approaches are examined here in some detail as 

72 
 
they have become increasingly popular in the past decade and are being 
implemented in organisations which provide services to adults with congenital 
deafblindness in Australia. Video Interaction Guidance techniques are also 
discussed. These are a newer set of approaches to encouraging positive 
interactions, which have only very recently been applied in the disability context. 
They show good potential as a sustainable approach to intervention.  
 
Active Support  
Active Support is “a package of procedures which includes activity planning, 
support planning and training on providing effective assistance” (Jones et al., 
1999, p. 164). Increasingly, studies are finding that Active Support increases the 
meaningful engagement of adults with intellectual disabilities, including those 
with severe and profound intellectual disabilities (e.g., Jones et al., 1999; 
Mansell, Elliott, Beadle-Brown, Ashman, & Macdonald, 2002; Riches et al., 
2011; Stancliffe, Harman, Toogood, & McVilly, 2007). Stancliffe et al. (2007)  
claim that staff help consistently results in and maintains the engagement of 
residents. This is relevant to the current study as staff help necessarily involves 
interactions and shared experiences upon which opportunities to experience the 
good life can be founded. Another outcome of Active Support reported in the 
research literature is that the effectiveness of Active Support is independent of a 
client’s level of adaptive behaviour (Stancliffe et al., 2007). This suggests its 
potential value for promoting opportunities to experience the good life for adults 
with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities.   
 

73 
 
Jones et al. (1999) found that implementing Active Support did not increase 
levels of social engagement for the adults with intellectual disabilities in their 
study. This is of particular interest and relevance to this thesis. Of some 
concern in evaluating the efficacy of Active Support as an intervention is the 
construct of meaningful engagement. The judgement about what constitutes 
meaningful activity has typically been made by scientist practitioners without 
consultation with individuals with intellectual disabilities, their families, or the 
staff who support them.  
 
Despite these potential limitations, proponents of Active Support have 
developed tools to evaluate the efficacy of implementing an Active Support 
program. These could potentially be used to examine opportunities for adults 
with congenital deafblindness to experience the good life. These tools have a 
number of advantages over some of the evaluation tools mentioned earlier in 
this chapter, and over those designed for use with children mentioned in the 
previous chapter. For example, the coding tool devised by Jones et al. (1999) to 
evaluate the efficacy of Active Support has established interrater reliability. It 
examines both client and staff behaviours, and has been used in adult 
residential settings with clients with severe intellectual disabilities.  
 
Intensive Interaction  
“Intensive Interaction is an approach to teaching and spending time with people 
with learning difficulties which is aimed specifically at developing the most 
fundamental social and communication abilities” (Nind, 1999, p. 96). It is an 
intervention approach specifically designed for people with profound intellectual 

74 
 
and multiple disabilities. It has also been applied to people on the autism 
spectrum. Like Active Support, Intensive Interaction is becoming increasingly 
popular as a whole-of-service approach to increasing client engagement and 
interaction. As presented in the previous chapter, the theoretical foundations of 
Intensive Interaction are very similar to intervention approaches with people 
with congenital deafblindness and draw largely on infant communication 
development theories. However, unlike research into interactions with people 
with congenital deafblindness, there is considerably more literature available on 
the implementation and efficacy of Intensive Interaction programs in settings 
where staff support adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. 
This research can provide valuable insights to progress work with adults with 
congenital deafblindness.  
 
Studies investigating the efficacy of Intensive Interaction have found increased 
observable discrete behaviours related to interactive ability. These include: eye 
gaze, bodily orientation to partner, proximity to partner, emotional valence and 
joint focus (Kellett & Nind, 2003a, 2003b; Leaning & Watson, 2006; Zeedyk, 
Caldwell, & Davies, 2009). 
 
One of the key issues raised by researchers investigating the outcomes of 
Intensive Interaction, which can help inform research with adults with congenital 
deafblindness, is the importance of reflective practice. “Reflection is vital to 
sustaining as well as improving our interaction practice” (Kellett & Nind, 2003b, 
p. 52). Such a professional activity could inform or suggest a useful research 

75 
 
methodology in which participants might be asked to consider and interpret their 
practice. Reflective practice is an important component of supervision (Carroll, 
2010), lending support to approaches that used targeted supervision as an 
intervention strategy. Reflective practice could and should be considered as 
both a potential research method for data creation, as well as an intervention 
strategy.  
 
Similarly, Nind and Hewett (1994) emphasise the importance of staff sharing 
their experiences with each other and being mindful of pitfalls, such as being 
too passive, not moving on, forcing an agenda, boredom, tasklessness, and 
issues around age appropriateness. These topics may be important to consider 
during supervision or other reflective practices. Certainly, they are not well 
addressed in the current research literature, but warrant further investigation.    
 
Of particular bearing to the pursuit of opportunities for the good life for adults 
with congenital deafblindness is Sandford’s (2011) presentation of literature 
linking positive psychology and Intensive Interaction. She argues:  
a review of the (above) literature suggests that positive psychology can offer a 
number of valuable insights and questions that could usefully be explored in 
relation to Intensive Interaction, most especially the concept of flow and the 
emphasis on strengths (Sandford, 2011, p. 4).  
 
The concept of flow was developed by Csikszentmihalyi and can be described 
as the moments when we lose track of time by being engaged and absorbed in 
something which poses the right degree of challenge to our level of ability 
(Sandford, 2011).  
 

76 
 
Similarly, Harding and Berry (2009) highlight the consistencies between 
Intensive Interaction and three major schools of psychological thought: 
humanistic psychology, attachment theory, and positive psychology. They argue 
that “these approaches share a core tenet that positive human relationships are 
crucial to our sense of self-worth, ability to realise our potential and our 
psychological well-being” (Harding & Berry, 2009, p. 758). Clearly, the principles 
of Intensive Interaction are compelling when considering ways to address the 
good life for adults with congenital deafblindness and those with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. 
 
Notwithstanding this, despite the many studies reporting positive effects of 
Intensive Interaction “there still appears to be a number of philosophical, 
practical and organisational barriers to sustained approach adoption” (Firth et 
al., 2008, p. 11). These issues are discussed further below.  
 
Video Interaction Guidance and Marte Meo 
Marte Meo, meaning “on one’s own strength”, is an approach which identifies 
and fosters skills to enable positive interactions and development (Aarts, 2008). 
Marte Meo employs Video Interaction Guidance, a process whereby the 
clinician and interaction partner review edited videos of naturally occurring 
interactions. They describe what is occurring on the screen, how the person 
with the need for development is getting their needs met, and why this is 
occurring. The Marte Meo intervention method is associated with an approach 
to coping based on empowerment (Vik & Hafting, 2009).  
 

77 
 
Reviewing videos of naturally occurring interactions is becoming increasingly 
popular as an approach to intervention. Marte Meo shares this strategy with a 
number of other approaches. These include: Video-feedback Intervention to 
promote Positive Parenting (see Groeneveld, Vermeer, Van Ijzendoorn, & 
Linting, 2011), Video Interaction Guidance (see Kennedy & Sked, 2008) used 
with people with congenital deafblindness, and interaction guidance with video 
analysis (see Martens, van de Ven, & Janssen, 2003; Snow & Telling, 2011). 
 
There is relatively limited research investigating the efficacy of the Marte Meo 
approach. Studies that have employed it report improved interactions between 
the following groups: mothers with post-natal depression and their infants (Vik & 
Braten, 2009), families newly caring for internationally adopted children 
(Osterman & Moller, 2010), and Aboriginal mothers and their young children 
(Lee, Griffiths, Glossop, & Eapen, 2010). It has also been effective with children 
who display externalising behaviour problems in a school setting (Axberg, 
Hansson, Broberg, & Wertberg, 2006). 
 
Of key interest are the assertions of Snow and Telling (2011). They note that 
some of the reasons for the success of video analysis are: its applicability in 
different environments, the way staff are supported to become active 
independent learners, and the limited paper work involved. These points relate 
specifically to staff working with adults with congenital deafblindness. However, 
these assertions require further research to better understand staff perspectives 
and possible other benefits of this approach.  

78 
 
 
Certainly these approaches are consistent with the principles of reflective 
practice and targeted supervision, mentioned above, as worthwhile when 
discussing Intensive Interaction. Indeed Video Interaction Guidance does not 
preclude the use of other approaches and could readily be incorporated into 
Active Support or Intensive Interaction processes.  
 
Outcome measures 
The above discussion touched on outcome measures that are associated with a 
variety of intervention strategies. This section examines typically used outcome 
measures in more detail. In particular, those used to determine the efficacy of 
interventions designed to improve interactions, or opportunities to experience 
the good life. There is general agreement in the literature around the need to 
increase and enhance the quantity and quality of interactions between disability 
support workers and the nonverbal adults they support (see Clegg et al., 1991a, 
1991b; Finlay et al., 2008; Golden & Reese, 1996; Healy & Noonan Walsh, 
2007; Jones et al., 1999; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991). These authors have 
reached their conclusions through observational studies using a variety of 
coding tools to measure behaviours. These include: initiations of interaction 
(Finlay et al., 2008; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991), positive behaviours (e.g., 
smiling, eye contact) and negative behaviours (e.g., self-stimulation) (Clegg et 
al., 1991a; Golden & Reese, 1996). 
 
Clegg et al. (1991a) note that the broad coding categories used in their study 
limit what is revealed by it. They point out that simple systems are more likely to 

79 
 
generate robust reproducible findings. In another study, these authors note the 
decrease in reliability of observations of adults with limited physical movements 
and those with vision impairments (Clegg et al., 1991b). This is of particular 
relevance to investigations of the interactions of adults with congenital 
deafblindness, as all will have vision impairments and associated idiosyncratic 
behaviours, increasing the challenge of achieving inter-observer reliability. 
 
A variety of intervention strategies and approaches have been outlined above. 
Prior to trialling these interventions on adults with congenital deafblindness, 
there is a need to establish the validity and reliability of the outcome measures 
used to evaluate their effectiveness. Outcome measures for interventions in 
related populations have typically included levels of participant behaviours, such 
as eye contact, smiling, self-stimulation (Leaning & Watson, 2006); 
vocalisations, active engagement (Firth et al., 2008; Forster & Iacono, 2008); 
and staff engagement with residents (Forster & Iacono, 2008). Behaviour 
states, such as asleep, drowsy, awake–active, have also been used as 
outcome measures (e.g., Foreman, Arthur-Kelly, & Pascoe, 2007). Outcomes 
are commonly measured using direct observation and video recordings (e.g., 
Firth et al., 2008; Forster & Iacono, 2008; Leaning & Watson, 2006). 
 
This variety of outcome measures highlights the importance of including 
measures that take into account both the nature of staff and client behaviours, 
and the frequency and duration of these behaviours. As well as establishing the 
reliability of outcome measures, there is also a need to involve disability support 

80 
 
workers in determining what exactly is being measured and what would be 
considered a positive outcome.  
 
There is a major issue inherent in improving and enhancing the quality and 
quantity of interactions between staff and adult clients through training. A 
number of researchers have recognised the importance of involving staff in the 
development of intervention goals and strategies. However, the researchers 
proceed with the premise that there is a problem that requires intervention 
without first gaining greater insight into how the staff perceive the current 
situation. All of the research cited above on what occurs in interactions between 
staff and clients, and the efficacy of intervention approaches, employed purely 
quantitative methods. This research fails to address or examine what is 
occurring from the perspective of the staff involved in the interactions.  
 
Staff perspectives  
Staff play a key role as interaction partners and mediators of the life 
experiences of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, and 
those with congenital deafblindness. Yet their perspectives are largely lacking 
from the research in which they are involved, as is their view on the relative 
need for intervention. A number of studies assess staff satisfaction with the 
process (e.g., Burgio et al., 1983; Firth et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2003a; 
Riches et al., 2011). However, they do not involve staff from the outset in the 
design of the research. 
 

81 
 
Much of the research into communication and interactions with people with 
congenital deafblindness has been about educators by educators (e.g., Amaral, 
2003; Bruce, 2002; Janssen et al., 2004). Educators will inherently bring a 
different lens to the situation. They have worked in the role themselves and thus 
have a sound understanding of the context. The disability support workers who 
mediate the support of adults with congenital deafblindness are rarely the 
people who are undertaking the research. As mentioned, this is a major 
limitation of most of the research undertaken to date. Ehrlich’s (2007) study is 
one of the few where a disability support worker undertook the research. Her 
study indicated there were issues for staff in balancing the needs of clients and 
the organisation. It also discussed the difficulty for staff in administering 
assessment tools which require a thorough knowledge of the theory 
underpinning them. These issues are not well addressed in most current 
approaches to intervention.       
 
A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of certain intervention 
approaches, but they have rarely involved staff in the establishment phases of 
the research process. There also remain issues in the long-term efficacy of 
approaches, particularly due to the high turnover of staff (Hall & Hall, 2002; 
Hewitt & Larsen, 2007), but also due to initiative decay (cf.Buchanan, Claydon, 
& Doyle, 1999). This occurred in the study of Firth et al. (2008) that 
implemented Intensive Interaction in a residential service for adults with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
 

82 
 
Clegg et al. (1991a) raise the issue that staff in their study were not asked about 
the perception of their roles or their interactions with clients. They contend that 
this type of research is needed. Maes et al. (2007) similarly argue the need to 
involve staff as informants in research into quality of life enhancing strategies 
for adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
 
The dominant methodological approach to investigating interactions between 
staff and adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities is multiple, 
single case experimental design, using an observational coding tool. This is 
similar to research into interactions between people with congenital 
deafblindness and their interaction partners. In more recent years an increasing 
variety of research designs and methods are being employed.  
 
Greater insights into staff perspectives are beginning to emerge with an 
increase in the use of qualitative research methods. As interest in, and use of, 
qualitative research methods has grown (Creswell, 2009), researchers 
investigating interactions with people with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities are increasingly using interviews as a data collection method. This 
enables them to gain greater insights into staff–client interactions (e.g., Forster 
& Iacono, 2008; Healy & Noonan Walsh, 2007; Koski, Martikainen, Burakoff, & 
Launonen, 2010). Koski et al. (2010) interviewed staff pre- and post-training to 
gain an understanding of the impact of training from the staff's perspectives. 
Healey and Noonan Walsh (2007) and Koski et al. (2010) interviewed staff 
about communicating with people with profound intellectual and multiple 

83 
 
disabilities. They found gaps in staff’s knowledge about what staff believed was 
important when communicating with the people they support and how they 
actually communicated. Overall, the researchers identified an inconsistency 
between the strategies used by staff to communicate and the communicative 
needs of the clients they supported. This is also reflected in the study by Firth et 
al. (2008) which indicated inconsistency between staff reports and researcher 
observations. These findings suggest the need for further development of 
intervention strategies, but they do not elucidate the best method of 
intervention.  
 
Hart (2006) speculates that a mismatch in the modalities of communication 
between two partners might have a more significant effect on development than 
the sensory impairment itself. As presented in the literature above, there is 
increasing evidence that such mismatches in modalities of communication are 
common in interactions between staff and adults with congenital deafblindness, 
and those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. While much of the 
intervention in this area has tried to target these mismatches, little has been 
done to address the mismatch between what staff report and what researchers 
observe.  
 
The information that is available on staff’s perspectives highlights the value in 
seeking their views. It offers new and varied insights into the current situation 
for adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities and congenital 
deafblindness. For example, Forster and Iacono 
(2008) found that 

84 
 
communicating in the preferred way of a person with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities was of importance to staff. However, this communication 
style was perceived by staff as conflicting with the policy and preferred practices 
of their employing organisation. This is consistent with Ehrlich’s (2007) claims 
that staff struggle to balance the needs of clients and those of the organisation.  
Age appropriate communication in particular was raised as an issue. This is 
consistent with Nyling’s (2003) assertion that working in a developmentally 
appropriate way is challenging for disability support workers who support adults. 
Forster and Iacono’s (2008) study provides more valuable insight into why this 
may be (the perception that it is in conflict with organisational policy and 
practices). However, further research is required in this area to better 
understand the perspectives and motivations of staff with regard to interacting 
with adults in a developmentally appropriate way.  
 
Interestingly, only those studies which utilised multiple methods of data creation 
found discrepancies between reports from staff in interviews and researcher 
observations, highlighting a key issue for research and practice. The methods of 
data collection included: participant observation using a coding tool combined 
with staff interviews (e.g,. Healy & Noonan Walsh, 2007), or staff interviews 
combined with researchers’ informal observations and log trail (e.g., Firth et al., 
2008). The discrepancy between the views of staff and researchers needs to be 
reconciled before sustainable positive outcomes can be achieved for adults with 
congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. In contrast, McVilly’s (1997) survey of staff needs took a quantitative 

85 
 
approach to involving staff as informants. Staff rated as high their need for 
training in management of inappropriate behaviour, and in communication skills. 
Most rated their job readiness as low. McVilly’s (1997) study demonstrates the 
potential value in using quantitative approaches to better understand staff 
perspectives. Nevertheless, quantitative methods necessarily limit the 
information gained. They also risk missing new insights not yet considered by 
the researcher, which qualitative methods are more likely to achieve. 
 
Indeed, the studies that are discussed above which employed qualitative and 
mixed methods have yielded new information that may provide further insights 
into why intervention effects do not necessarily endure. The issue of long-term 
efficacy and sustainability of intervention is of key concern to me after years of 
observing strategies which were working well, but were abandoned after staff 
turnover. The intervention approaches employed to date do not adequately 
address the need for their positive outcomes to be sustained. In order to 
address this issue of sustainability a broader examination of the factors 
influencing staff–client interaction is required. The following section summarises 
some key issues which need to be considered when designing interventions if 
they are to achieve sustainable positive outcomes.  
 
Issues to be considered when designing interventions 
In examining the good life for adults with congenital deafblindness I have 
established the importance of gaining a greater understanding of the 
perspectives of disability support workers. However, to better appreciate these 

86 
 
perspectives, there is also value in understanding the broader context in which 
disability support workers are operating. The literature presented so far points to 
the need for change, yet to facilitate long-term sustainable change there is a 
need to understand the history and current factors shaping the sector. 
 
Hewitt and Larsen (2007) highlight a number of key issues for the disability 
sector. These are: recruitment and high turnover of staff; low wages; the need 
for training; staff burnout; and the need for staff supervision. All of these issues 
impact on service users. These are also all long-term issues which have 
changed little over time and essentially are the result of a lack of financial 
investment by government into the sector. 
 
With regard to recruitment, Hall and Hall (2002) point out the inconsistencies 
from management about what characteristics are desirable in direct support 
staff. They conclude with a recommendation to better evaluate staff values and 
attitudes prior to hiring them. Given the difficulty in hiring staff in the first 
instance due to the low wages relative to the high demands of the role (Hewitt & 
Larsen, 2007), it is extremely difficult for organisations to be selective and only 
hire staff with a high level of alignment in their values and attitudes. There is a 
clear need to develop cultures of practice within organisations in which new 
staff can be indoctrinated. 
 
Adults with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities are served by the broader, much larger disability sector and are thus 

87 
 
impacted by generalist policies and approaches. “In a way, the rhetoric of the 
right of participation and full citizenship might lead to limitations, instead of 
enlargement, of freedom of choice for these individuals and their families” 
(Nakken & Vlaskamp, 2007, p. 84). Of key concern is the current emphasis on 
community inclusion and community capacity building. The Victorian State 
Disability Plan (State Government of Victoria, 2002) posits that inclusive 
communities are places where people can participate in all aspects of 
community life. While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this statement, 
problems occur in the interpretation of such statements when applied to people 
with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, including those with 
congenital deafblindness. The primary issue is that the term community is 
understood as a place. If a person with a disability is present in a public space, 
such as a café, swimming pool or gymnasium, the implication is that they have 
then had an experience of being in the community. A number of authors argue 
community is an experience and not a place (Caldwell, 2007; J. S. Reinders, 
2002). It is troubling that these experiences of being in the community could be 
exchanged for, or valued over, actual experiences of community or social 
connectedness or togetherness as a result of policy directives. Yet “these 
disconnections between policy visions and stakeholder expectations persist” 
(Bigby, Wilson, Balandin, & Stancliffe, 2011, p. 173). Indeed this issue with 
public policy is acknowledged by Johnson, Walmsley and Wolfe (2010). These 
authors propose that ideas of belonging and relationship-building may be more 
tangible than those of community and inclusion in the pursuit of a good life for 
people with intellectual disabilities.  

88 
 
This backdrop of a poorly resourced sector governed by broad governmental 
and organisational policies which do not necessarily address issues faced by 
smaller subgroups of people with disabilities should be considered in the design 
of quality enhancing interventions (cf. Productivity Commission, 2011). To 
ignore them is to most likely limit the long-term efficacy and sustainability of the 
approach.  
 
The past two chapters have highlighted some of the limitations in the research 
conducted to date with regard to enhancing the quality of life of adults with 
congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. I have focused specifically on research aimed at enhancing 
opportunities for these adults to experience the good life and how this might be 
evaluated.  A summary of the key issues is set out below. 
 
1. There is a lack of information as to whether the tools designed to evaluate 
quality of life are sensitive enough to detect changes resulting from 
intervention which would increase opportunities to experience the good 
life.  In particular, there is a paucity of data that relates to the domains of 
quality of life which consider personal relationships and social inclusion. 
2. There is a lack of tools developed specifically for adults which take into 
consideration differences in their needs relative to those of children. 
3. There is limited information about what is currently occurring in interactions 
between adults with congenital deafblindness and the disability support 
workers who mediate their support.  

89 
 
4. There is a lack of information from the perspective of disability support 
workers on what is occurring in these interactions.  
5. There is a paucity of intervention tools which adequately address the broad 
variety of factors influencing staff–client interactions in order to achieve more 
sustainable outcomes.  
 
The following chapter explores in more detail the methodological issues 
associated with research with adults with congenital deafblindness. Drawing on 
all of this information and my own experiences and perspectives as a scientist 
practitioner, I present the key questions to be addressed by this study and 
provide an overview of the design of the study.    
 
 

90 
 
Chapter Four: Research design 
 
Researchers have a responsibility to ensure the methodological integrity of their 
research, which includes explicitly stating the factors that shaped and 
influenced the research design. This chapter outlines my own orientation as a 
scientist practitioner and the factors that have contributed to my perspective. It 
reviews the methodological issues associated with the research topic from 
philosophical and pragmatic points of view. I then outline the rationale for the 
methodology I selected in light of the factors that shaped my understanding of 
the research topic. Ethical and practical issues relating to investigations 
involving participants with congenital deafblindness are also discussed. The 
chapter concludes with an overview of the research aims and methodology 
adopted.  
 
It is important to note that the placement of research aims and questions in this 
chapter is intentionally unorthodox. The reader requires background information 
to understand how the research aims and questions were derived. Therefore, 
the research aims and questions are presented toward the end of the chapter 
under the heading: Design of the study. 
 
My perspective as researcher 
In order to evaluate the trustworthiness of research, researchers must declare 
their philosophical position and ensure that the methods selected produce data 
that satisfactorily explain the issues in question. I approached the current 
investigation having qualified with a bachelor’s degree in speech pathology, and 

91 
 
having specialised in work with people with deafblindness for the past 15 years. 
The questions raised in this study are influenced by my clinical experience and 
how it has informed my understanding of the best way to provide appropriate 
support to disability support workers and in turn adults with congenital 
deafblindness. 
  
Given my perspective has largely been shaped by my experiences as a 
clinician, it is important to understand the clinical research paradigm. Miller and 
Crabtree (2000) suggest a number of strategies for clinical research as opposed 
to biomedical research. These assume transformation is grounded in 
experience rather than being rational, and that research participants must 
actively engage in methods if they are to take them up. This necessitates 
employing research methods which diverge from the quantitative methods 
traditionally used in biomedical research. In order to join the evidence-based 
medicine space, clinical researchers need to collaborate across disciplines; use 
multiple methods, bridging metaphors and theories; and often emphasise 
participatory and advocacy-based approaches (Miller & Crabtree, 2000). 
“Research designs in clinical research inherently require multimethod thinking, 
or critical multiplism, with the particular combinations of data gathering, analysis 
and interpretation approaches being driven by the research question and the 
clinical context” (Miller & Crabtree, 2000, p. 619). 
 
The original aim of this investigation was to identify interventions that enhance 
the quality of life of adults with congenital deafblindness with an emphasis on 

92 
 
the quality of life domains of social inclusion and personal relationships. I 
originally intended to undertake an intervention study given the positive results 
being achieved using interventions designed specifically for children with 
congenital deafblindness. However, on reflection, I was not satisfied that the 
tools available were adequate or appropriate to detect or evaluate change in the 
quality of life of an adult with congenital deafblindness as the result of targeted 
intervention. These issues were highlighted in relation to possible ways of 
operationalising the good life in chapter two. I was also dissatisfied with the way 
in which disability support workers have been involved in research to date. I 
suspected that this issue was related to the poor endurance and sustainability 
of intervention outcomes that I have witnessed. For these reasons, the current 
study was exploratory in nature in order to gain greater and deeper insights into 
what is currently occurring for adults with congenital deafblindness in their 
interactions with staff, and the factors potentially influencing these interactions. 
Several other factors with regard to the nature of congenital deafblindness also 
influenced and shaped the research design. These issues need to be fully 
presented as they substantially influenced the methodology ultimately selected.  
 
Methodological issues 
Why research this group?  
The number of people with deafblindness is low relative to other disability 
groups. However, the impact of dual sensory impairment on an individual’s 
wellbeing is pervasive. In addition, many of the interventions and strategies 
developed and applied to this group are relevant to other disability groups who 

93 
 
experience complex communication issues. These include people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities, autism, and dementia. It should be noted 
that “the number of individuals with fragile health and a combination of profound 
disabilities is increasing in the developed world as a result of advanced medical 
care, efforts of parents, and availability of facilities for education and living” 
(Nakken & Vlaskamp, 2007, p. 83). Better understanding the needs of, and 
issues facing, people with deafblindness can also benefit these other groups, 
which are increasing in number. The experiences of these groups are also 
largely mediated through paid staff, either disability support workers or nursing 
home staff. A sound understanding of the needs of these individuals will inform 
professional development for both direct support staff and other professionals 
involved in the lives of people with complex communication needs.    
 
How the nature of congenital deafblindness influences the selection of 
research methodologies  
In gaining a greater understanding of the current situation and the needs of 
adults with congenital deafblindness, it is important to examine where they are 
located in the broader disability research context. This helps to explain why little 
is currently known about this group. It also explains why methodologies 
considered to give the highest level of scientific evidence, that is, randomised 
control trials (cf. National Health and Medical Research Council, 1998, 2009) 
are not only challenging to achieve with this population but also not necessarily 
appropriate. “Good social science is problem driven and not methodology driven 
in the sense that it employs those methods that for a given problematic, best 
help answer the research questions at hand” (Flyvbjerg, 2006, p. 242). 

94 
 
The fact that deafblindness is a low incidence disability impacts on the nature of 
research with this group. Within the broader disability context, the field of 
deafblindness is relatively small. Estimates based on demographic studies in 
the Nordic countries during the 1970s, and more recently in Denmark in 2003, 
state that there will be 200 people with deafblindness per million in developed 
countries, and about one fifth of these people will have congenital deafblindness 
(Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006a). It remains extremely difficult in Australia to 
determine numbers of people with deafblindness. A 2005 study revealed only a 
very small percentage to be receiving services relative to the numbers 
estimated in the population. This is largely due to the lack of ability of service 
and government databases to adequately record dual sensory impairment (M. 
Prain, 2005). Only 0.2% of government funded disability service users (i.e., 322 
people) were recorded as having a primary disability of deafblindness in 
Australia in 2008-09 (Australian Institute of Health and Wellfare, 2011). 
Robertson and Emerson (2010) estimate that 212 per 100,000 of the general 
population in the United Kingdom have severe impairments of both hearing and 
vision, rising to 806 per 100,000 by 2030. Robertson and Emerson (2010) used 
multiple population-based national surveys to estimate prevalence. While these 
data bases arguably provided large, well constructed samples on which to base 
the estimates, they were limited in that they typically relied on self-report of 
disability. There was therefore no guarantee of diagnostic integrity in the 
samples. The only possible solution to this would be to conduct large scale 
screening studies. In Australia, the relatively small size of the population of 
people with congenital deafblindness influences the resources available to 

95 
 
conduct such studies with the desired precision. The issue of determining 
accurate numbers of people with deafblindness in itself highlights the low 
incidence of this disability, which in turn impacts on research. This is because it 
is difficult to locate large samples in one geographic location, necessarily 
limiting the nature of research options for this population.   
 
People with congenital deafblindness within the context of deafblindness  
When developing an understanding of the specific needs of people who are 
deafblind, there is a distinction between those who were born deafblind and 
those who acquire deafblindness later in life. The latter group, those with 
acquired deafblindness, account for about 80% of the deafblind population 
(Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006a). Though presenting with a dual sensory 
impairment, they typically display age appropriate cognitive and communicative 
functioning due to the delayed onset of their dual sensory impairment 
(Rönnberg & Borg, 2001). People with congenital deafblindness display more 
complex developmental issues and have greater support needs arising from 
their dual sensory impairment from birth (Rönnberg & Borg, 2001). Of particular 
concern are the major difficulties experienced by individuals with congenital 
deafblindness in acquiring communication skills, together with their relatively 
low level of interpersonal and social engagement (Pierangelo & Giuliani, 2007). 
 
The paucity of research concerning adults with congenital deafblindness 
therefore emerges in the context of these persons being a minority group within 
an already small population of people with deafblindness. Furthermore, the 

96 
 
developmental and associated communication difficulties experienced by this 
group, coupled with their idiosyncratic behavioural presentations, further 
confounds the selection of appropriate research methodologies. Adults with 
congenital deafblindness who communicate nonsymbolically cannot participate 
in research which requires them to work directly with the scientist practitioner 
providing information in either quantitative (e.g., surveys) or qualitative (e.g., 
interviews) forms.  
   
Why is little known about the experiences of adults with congenital 
deafblindness?  
Understanding why little is known about the experiences of adults with 
congenital deafblindness also highlights some key methodological issues in 
relation to research with this group. There are three likely explanations for the 
limited research into interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness.  
1.  The heterogeneity of people with deafblindness means it is difficult to find a 
group of individuals similar enough to apply a single and coherent  
intervention strategy to (Chen & Haney, 1995). This heterogeneity results 
from different levels of vision and hearing impairment, combined with 
different levels of physical and cognitive ability, depending on additional and 
associated disabilities. Typically, deafblind people require individualised 
interventions that do not lend themselves readily to large scale evaluation. 
Subsequently, many studies of people with congenital deafblindness utilise 
single case designs (Parker et al., 2007). While such studies can generate 
important insights to inform our understanding of the needs of such people 

97 
 
and meta analyses of multiple single case designs can lend weight to their 
findings, generalisation of findings by statistical inference is not possible.   
 
2.  There are specific education settings and services for children with 
congenital deafblindness, but this is rarely the case for adults. In Australia 
there are limited accommodation options for adults with deafblindness and 
no day services specifically for adults with deafblindness (M. Prain, 2005; 
Ward, 1994). People with deafblindness are therefore dispersed in the 
general population and among service settings. This fact complicates 
recruitment and the conduct of research. It also vitiates the implementation 
of comparable support and intervention programs. Mackintosh (2001) 
investigated an intervention strategy for adults with multiple disabilities, 
including a sensory impairment, living in community residences. She found 
that the travel between research participants limited her involvement with 
the intervention, thus limiting the research project.  
 
3. While some adults with congenital deafblindness develop symbolic 
communication skills, many do not and rely on others to interpret their 
idiosyncratic behaviours. For this reason, many people with congenital 
deafblindness are not able to self-report about their experiences, so 
researchers are dependent on proxy reports from people who know the 
individuals with congenital deafblindness well. This, as discussed in chapter 
two, poses challenges around validity, as well as raising additional practical 
and ethical issues when working with this group.  

98 
 
As discussed in chapter three, disability support workers are in many instances 
the people who adults with congenital deafblindness interact with the most, and 
who know these adults best. However, due to high staff turnover in this industry 
in Australia (Productivity Commission, 2011, p. 703), those who know the adults 
with congenital deafblindness best may have only known them for a short 
fraction of their life span.  
 
Issues around observing and recording idiosyncratic behaviours  
At Deafblind International conferences people presenting papers on the 
communication of people with congenital deafblindness often show a video and 
interpret the behaviour of the person with deafblindness in the video. 
Frequently, one or more people will raise their hands to dispute the 
interpretation of the behaviour and suggest an alternative meaning behind the 
behaviour.  
 
There are means within observation studies to minimise observer bias and 
maximise the objectivity of observers. For example Janssen et al. (2004) trained 
observers until 80% interobserver agreement was reached for all target 
behaviours during three sessions per participant prior to data collection. In order 
to control for observer drift and bias, observers were kept naïve as to the 
experimental hypothesis. In addition, before each observation session, the 
observers read the response definition. The observers were also not given 
feedback on the reliability of their scoring. However, one of the issues with 
quantitative measures is that they do not allow for alternative explanations 

99 
 
beyond the coding schedule being used in the study.  Thus they potentially limit 
new learning about the nature of communication and interaction of people with 
deafblindness.  
 
Typically used methodologies in researching interactions with people with 
congenital deafblindness  
As mentioned above, due to the heterogeneity and low incidence of people with 
congenital deafblindness there are very limited scientific investigations involving 
this population. The most common approach to research in this field has been 
single subject experimental design. Parker et al. (2007) identified 54 single 
subject studies with participants who are deafblind. The scope of the review 
covered the years from 1965 to 2006. The earliest study which met the authors’ 
criteria was published in 1969 and most studies employed quantitative research 
methods.  
 
However, qualitative methods are starting to be employed in research with 
people with congenital deafblindness (e.g., Hart, 2010; Martens, 2007; Preisler, 
2005). Interestingly, most of these studies examine the communicative nature, 
meaning and purpose of body language and gestures. This adds an important 
contribution to knowledge about interacting with people who are deafblind. But it 
is very much from the perspective of scientist practitioners, supported by 
literature and theory around communication development. There remains 
almost no information from the perspective of those who spend most time 
interacting with adults with congenital deafblindness, namely disability support 
workers. 

100 
 
Some researchers have included social validity measures in their studies. This 
addresses one of the issues raised by Maes et al. (2007) that those trained in 
the intervention processes are not consulted about the processes. Chen, Klein 
and Haney (2007) reported on parent feedback following their involvement in 
the Promoting Learning through Active Interaction (PLAI) program. And 
Janssen et al. (2004) undertook several measures to ensure the educators and 
parents involved in their study would accept and commit to the intervention 
program. During their study, educators were repeatedly consulted before, 
during, and after the intervention. They were also involved in: the selection of 
target behaviours and intervention situations, adapting the interaction context, 
and defining the intervention aims. An adapted social validity scale was used to 
assess the satisfaction of the educators with: the intervention procedure, the 
results, the observation procedure, the manual, and the experimental design. 
However, the participants in these studies were not involved in selecting or 
creating the coding tool to be used and thus had no input into what was 
considered important to measure or evaluate with regard to the intervention 
aims.  
 
“Because of the low incidence of deafblindness a cross section of practitioners, 
researchers, consumers, and families must collaborate to create a mosaic of 
evidence based approaches for education and rehabilitation” (Parker et al., 
2007, p. 697). I would include disability support workers as having a key role to 
play in both informing researchers and research.  

101 
 
Additional methodological issues   
One of the difficulties with research investigating issues for people with 
congenital deafblindness is the lack of tools with which to conduct reliable 
observations. In particular, tools with the capacity to take into account the 
complexities 
of 
the 
behaviours 
exhibited 
by 
adults 
with 
congenital 
deafblindness. Increasing numbers of studies are finding that quality of life and 
indices of pleasure can be observed with reasonable validity and reliability for 
those with complex communication needs (Green & Reid, 1996; Lyons, 2005; 
Petry & Maes, 2006). Despite this, significant methodological challenges remain 
in the measurement of quality of life for people with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities, and those with congenital deafblindness. A particular 
challenge is determining whether changes to quality of life have occurred as a 
result of quality of life enhancing interventions, as discussed in chapter two. 
Maes, Lambrechts, Hostyn and Petry (2007) reviewed studies investigating the 
efficacy of quality of life enhancing interventions for people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. Their review highlights a number of key 
methodological issues with current research in this area. Namely: sample sizes 
tend to be small; interobserver scores for most studies are acceptable but they 
are moderate and variable; there is often no control group; and some authors 
report wide variation in outcome between clients. In addition, some studies do 
not demonstrate maintenance, a key concern given the high turnover of staff in 
this sector, discussed in the previous chapter.  
 

102 
 
A number of additional concerns were raised in the literature and do not appear 
to have been satisfactorily addressed in any of the studies reviewed for this 
thesis. These concerns are: a lack of focus on determining the best conditions 
for implementing quality enhancing strategies (e.g., organisational supports, 
staff development strategies, location); a lack of consultation with the staff 
trained to implement the quality enhancing strategies as to whether the 
objectives of the intervention were clear; more fundamentally, the need to ask 
staff whether the objectives of the intervention were compatible with their values 
and vision; and whether the intervention attunes to staff priorities. 
 
The selection of a methodology must of course be informed by its established 
validity and its practical application to the research question. The nature of the 
participants and the context in which the research is to be conducted can also 
influence the approach to the research and the selection of a methodology, or 
combination of methodologies. The following section addresses these issues in 
relation to the current research topic.    
 
Design of the study 
Research aims and questions 
The impetus for this study emerged from my experiences over the past 15 years 
working with disability support workers to further develop the communication 
skills of adults with congenital deafblindness in order to improve their quality of 
life. The original aim of this study was to identify interventions which improve 
and enhance the quality of life of adults with congenital deafblindness with 

103 
 
specific emphasis on the quality of life domains of social inclusion and personal 
relationships. These domains are the most relevant to an individual’s 
experience of the good life. (See chapter two for an explanation of the quality of 
life construct and why these domains are of pivotal importance in evaluating the 
quality of life of adults with congenital deafblindness). However, the specific 
aims of the study changed. This was because of a number of factors that 
influenced the aim, objectives and design of this study. These factors included: 
- 
extremely limited information about the current experiences of adults with 
congenital deafblindness 
- 
a paucity of tools with which to evaluate the efficacy of interventions 
which consider the quality of life construct 
- 
the perspectives of the primary communication partners of adults with 
congenital deafblindness are lacking in the literature and it is unclear 
whether current interventions are consistent with their needs and values 
- 
adults with congenital deafblindness are a very small heterogeneous 
group 
- 
adults with congenital deafblindness, for the most part, are unable to self-
report about their experiences. 
 
For these reasons, considerably more information was required. It was 
therefore necessary to adjust the aim to reflect the need for additional 
information prior to commencing intervention. Thus the aim of this study was to 
investigate Reinders’ (2002) construct of the good life in relation to adults with 
congenital deafblindness and, more specifically, the issues set out below. 

104 
 
Research Aims 
- 
To investigate what is currently occurring in interactions between adults 
with congenital deafblindness living in community residences and the 
staff who mediate their support. (Interactions, as stated in chapter two, 
provide the vehicle through which opportunities to experience the good 
life can occur.)  
- 
 To gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing these 
interactions. 
- 
To gain a deeper understanding of factors which would contribute to 
determining the most philosophically and methodologically sound and 
effective method for evaluating these interactions.  
 
At the outset of this investigation I had planned to conduct an intervention study. 
In the initial phase, while reviewing the literature, I was searching for a 
measurement tool which I could use to generate baseline data. Given the 
dearth of tools used with adults with congenital deafblindness to evaluate their 
interactions, the coding tool devised by Jones et al. (1999) was selected. While 
it was designed to evaluate active engagement, it was also designed to 
determine the frequency, duration and nature of staff : client interactions, 
including documentation of instances of ‘social engagement’.  It has a number 
of features that address many of the issues I have discussed in earlier chapters. 
- 
It has established validity and reliability, and has been used successfully 
in an Australian context (Stancliffe et al., 2007).  

105 
 
- 
It is an objective measure removing the need for proxy reports. 
- 
It has been used in adult residential settings with adults who 
communicate nonverbally. 
- 
Its theoretical underpinnings are less abstract and academic than those 
tools grounded in human communication development theory outlined in 
chapter two. This makes the tool potentially more accessible to disability 
support workers. 
- 
It examines the behaviours of both staff and clients. 
- 
It specifically identifies social interaction as a behavioural code, thus 
potentially indicating frequency of opportunities for adults with congenital 
deafblindness to experience the good life.  
 
The coding tool devised by Jones et al. (1999) was selected in order to address 
the following research questions in line with the research aims stated above. 
 
Research questions – phase one 
1. Is the coding tool designed by Jones et al. (1999) equally useful and reliable 
for observing the interactions of a different but similar population, namely 
adults with congenital deafblindness? 
2. What is the form and frequency of interactions between adults with    
congenital deafblindness and the staff who mediate their support? 
3. Are the form and frequency of interactions between adults with congenital 
deafblindness and the staff who support them similar to those between 
adults with severe intellectual disabilities and the staff who support them? 
This question arises out of the fact that there is very limited information 

106 
 
about the form and frequency of interactions between disability support 
workers and the people who adults with congenital deafblindness share 
services with in Australia, namely adults with severe intellectual disabilities. 
As stated, I had originally intended to undertake an intervention study. The 
results from the first phase of the study, paired with my clinical experience, 
fuelled the need to explore the situation further. This phase yielded more 
questions I felt needed to be addressed in order to better understand what was 
required of an intervention strategy that would be sustainable. Typically used 
quantitative methods were not appropriate to address the nature of the 
questions raised in chapter three, and that also arose from the first phase of the 
study.   
 
Therefore, the second phase of the investigation, which used qualitative 
methods, addressed the following research questions. 
 
Research questions – phase two 
1. What are the perspectives of staff on their interactions with adults with 
congenital deafblindness? 
2. How do accounts by staff of their interactions with adults with congenital 
deafblindness contribute to an understanding of the interactions observed in 
quantitative studies? How might this information influence intervention 
approaches aiming to facilitate opportunities to experience the good life?  
 

107 
 
Use of mixed methods 
Given the scarcity of information about what occurs in the interactions of adults 
with congenital deafblindness and how best to examine them, a mixed method 
approach was deemed most valuable to address the research questions. Mixed 
method designs employ both quantitative and qualitative research methods in 
varying sequences or concurrently. In the current study, a qualitative 
methodology was used to better understand and build upon the findings of the 
initial quantitative phase of the study.  
 
The strategy of inquiry employed in this investigation is best described as the 
concurrent triangulation strategy outlined by Creswell (2009). The data were 
generated in two distinct phases, that is, sequentially rather than concurrently. 
The two data sets were compared to determine convergence, difference, or a 
combination of both, which is typical of the concurrent triangulation strategy. 
The mixing of the qualitative and quantitative methods occurs at the level of 
interpretation, at which point the two data sets need to be transformed in order 
to be in a state in which they can be compared.  
 
The concurrent triangulation strategy was chosen to offset the limitations of one 
method with the strengths of the other. However, this strategy has its own 
limitations. It requires considerable effort and expertise to adequately 
investigate a phenomenon with two separate methods. It can also be difficult 
comparing analyses of data of two different forms. In addition, there is potential 

108 
 
difficulty in dealing with discrepancies that may arise when comparing the data 
(Creswell, 2009). 
 
The method used in the quantitative phase of the study was observation using 
the quantitative coding tool devised by Jones et al. (1999). The qualitative 
method used in phase two was interview combined with researcher’s log trail. 
These methods are described in more detail in subsequent chapters. The 
remainder of this chapter outlines the ethics procedure that governed the two 
phases of the study. The sampling method used to recruit participants in the 
investigation and the setting where the study took place is discussed. More 
detailed descriptions of the participants are provided in chapters five and six.     
 
Ethics 
Ethics approval was granted to undertake the study proposed in BSETAPP 66 – 
07 PRAIN by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University Human 
Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (see Appendix A.). The application was 
supported by the organisation where the participants with congenital 
deafblindness were provided with accommodation support and where the 
disability support workers were employed. A discussion about the ethical issues 
arising during the study and how these were addressed is included at the end of 
chapter six.  
 

109 
 
Participants 
Participants in this study were selected using a typical case sampling approach; 
one of the purposive sampling strategies usually used for qualitative research 
outlined by Patton (2002). As is common in research with people with 
congenital deafblindness, the sample was taken from the researcher’s place of 
work. While this is a relatively common practice, its merits and limitations are 
rarely discussed. Issues associated with immersion of researcher in the context 
of the phenomenon being researched, and researcher bias, are examined in the 
discussion of consensus coding in the following chapter.    
 
Two houses (residential services owned and operated for people with multiple 
disabilities) were selected to increase the potential number of participants. It 
was limited to two due to time constraints around data collection and analysis. 
The two houses were specifically for adults with congenital deafblindness; the 
adults living in these two houses communicated predominantly through 
nonverbal means. In Australia, there are extremely few accommodation 
services specifically for adults with congenital deafblindness, with services 
operating in only four of the eight states and territories. These services do not 
adequately meet the needs of the relevant populations (M. Prain, 2005).  
 
The methodologies and results of the quantitative and qualitative phases of the 
study are presented in chapter five (quantitative) and chapter six (qualitative). 
These chapters conclude with key findings and recommendations arising from 

110 
 
these discrete phases of the study. An integrated discussion of these findings, 
as well as implications, is provided in chapter seven.  
 
 

111 
 
Chapter Five: Phase one 
 
The previous chapters presented information about what is currently understood 
about interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness and the staff 
who support them. I have discussed how this understanding has been 
determined by scientist practitioners to date, my own clinical experiences, and 
how these have shaped my understanding of the situation. It is the interaction 
between these bodies of knowledge and ways of knowing which gave rise to the 
first phase of this study. 
 
This chapter presents the research aims, design, procedure, and results from 
the first phase of the study. The chapter discusses the results in light of the 
relevant literature and my own experiences and observations. It concludes with 
recommendations for future research, which includes a rationale for the second 
phase of the study. It should be noted that much of the content from this chapter 
is published in the articles “Observing the behaviour and interactions of adults 
with congenital deafblindness living in community residences” (M. Prain, 
McVilly, Ramcharan, Currie, & Reece, 2010) and “Being reliable: issues in 
determining the reliability and making sense of observations of adults with 
congenital deafblindness”. (M. Prain, McVilly, & Ramcharan, 2012a). However, 
the rationale for the second phase of the study is not presented in either of 
these articles.  
 

112 
 
Aims of phase one 
The aims of the first phase of the study were to examine the topography of 
current interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness and their 
support staff, and to compare these with the interactions of adults with severe 
intellectual disabilities. A concurrent aim was to investigate the reliability of a 
coding system originally designed by Jones et al. (1999) for use in the 
observation of adults with severe intellectual disabilities when applied to adults 
with congenital deafblindness.  
 
The coding system was selected for a number of reasons. First, the Jones et al.  
(1999) coding system had been specifically designed for use in observations 
involving adults with severe disabilities interacting with staff. This is in contrast 
to many other tools that have been designed with parent(mother)–infant 
interaction as their theoretical basis. Second, the items in the observation 
schedule reflected typical everyday activities for adults with severe and multiple 
disabilities in community residential settings. This was consistent with the 
context in which the observations were to be conducted. Third, the original tool 
had established validity and reliability, and these psychometric properties had 
been replicated in an Australian community residential service setting for adults 
with intellectual disabilities (Stancliffe, Harman, Toogood & McVilly, 2007).  
Finally, the use of the tool would enable meaningful comparisons to be made 
between the interactions of adults with congenital deafblindness and those with 
severe intellectual disabilities.     
 

113 
 
The research questions addressed by this first phase of the study are set out 
below. 
1. Is the coding tool designed by Jones et al. (1999) useful and reliable for 
observing the interactions of adults with congenital deafblindness? 
2. What is the form and frequency of interactions between adults with 
congenital deafblindness and the staff who mediate their support? In other 
words what are the current opportunities for adults with congenital 
deafblindness to experience the good life? 
3. Are the form and frequency of interactions between adults with congenital 
deafblindness and the staff who support them similar to those between 
adults with severe intellectual disabilities and the staff who support them? 
 
Design of phase one 
This phase of the study was conducted as observational research in a 
naturalistic setting and involved a purposive sample. It was essentially 
exploratory, consistent with the research objective to ascertain the form and 
frequency of the interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness and 
the staff who mediate their support. A multiple, single case design was used, 
which is typical in deafblind research, due to the relatively small size of the 
potential participant population (Parker et al., 2007). 
 
Ethics 
As outlined in chapter four, this investigation was approved by the Royal 
Melbourne Institute of Technology University Human Research Ethics 

114 
 
Committee. Staff and legal guardians of the adults with congenital 
deafblindness were given statements in plain English that explained the 
research to be undertaken (see Appendix B). They were also given consent 
forms to be completed if they agreed to participate in the research. Issues 
related to consent are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
 
Participants in phase one  
Adults with congenital deafblindness  
Nine adults with congenital deafblindness from two community residences in an 
Australian metropolitan setting participated in the first phase of the study: five 
from house one and four from house two. Three residents were male and six 
were female, aged between 22 and 44 years (M = 34.33 years, SD = 6.78 
years). All participants had lived in the residences for at least 10 years and all 
satisfied the criteria for congenital deafblindness as described by Rodbroe & 
Janssen (2006a). Three also had diagnoses of cerebral palsy, one had an 
additional diagnosis of epilepsy, and one had both diagnoses of cerebral palsy 
and epilepsy. Deafblindness was defined in chapter one and it is generally 
agreed that a functional definition is of more use than a medical definition. For 
research purposes, however, there is value in having a greater understanding of 
the nature of the vision and hearing impairments of the research participants. 
The following provides some additional information about the participants in the 
current study.  
 

115 
 
The precise nature of the vision and hearing impairments varied among 
residents; all were reported in agency records to satisfy the criteria for having a 
hearing disability. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2007) 
describes a hearing disability as encompassing deafness, hearing impairment 
and hearing loss. The World Health Organisation defines these terms in the 
following way: 
Deafness refers to the complete loss of hearing ability in one or two ears. 
Hearing impairment refers to both complete and partial loss of the ability to 
hear. 
 
There are two types of hearing impairment, according to which part of the ear is 
affected. Conductive hearing impairment is a problem in the outer or middle ear. 
It is often medically or surgically treatable. A common example is chronic 
middle ear infection. Sensorineural hearing impairment is a problem with the 
inner ear, or, occasionally with the hearing nerve. It is usually permanent and 
requires rehabilitation such as the use of a hearing aid. Sensorineural hearing 
impairment is commonly due to excessive noise, ageing and infectious 
diseases such as meningitis, measles rubella and mumps (World Health 
Organisation, 2012a). 
 
 
Agency records also indicated that all participants satisfied the criteria for being 
legally blind. A person who is legally blind in Australia has a visual acuity of 6/60 
or less, or a visual field of less than 10 degrees, or both (Retina Australia, 
2009). The definition of legal blindness in Australia is consistent with the World 
Health Organisation’s definition of low vision and blindness, which are as 
follows:  
There are four levels of visual function, according to the International 
Classification of Diseases – 10 (Update and Revision 2006):  
 
normal vision 
 
moderate visual impairment 
 
severe visual impairment 
 
blindness. 
 
Moderate visual impairment combined with severe visual impairment are 
grouped under the term “low vision”: low vision taken together with blindness 
represents all visual impairment (World Health Organisation, 2012b). 

116 
 
It should be noted that some people with moderate visual impairment may not 
satisfy the criteria for legal blindness in Australia.  
 
Each of the participants with deafblindness was assessed using the Vineland 
Adaptive Behaviour Scales (Sparrow, Cicchetti, & Balla, 2005). Adaptive 
behaviour is defined by the authors of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 
as the performance of daily activities required for personal and social sufficiency 
(Sparrow et al., 2005). All the participants with deafblindness scored low on 
adaptive level. A score of low on adaptive level is equivalent to a percentile rank 
range of 2 and below (Sparrow et al., 2005).   
 
Speech pathology reports indicated that all residents were intentional 
communicators and used primarily nonsymbolic means for expressive 
communication (e.g., vocalisations, facial expression and body language). See 
Tables 1 and 2 for more detailed participant information.

Disability Support Workers:  
Nine disability support workers participated in the first phase of the investigation: five in house one and four in house two. There were seven females and two 
males aged between 24 and 59 years (M = 34.33 years, SD = 14.36 years).  Both males worked in house one. Eight staff had completed a national vocational 
qualification (a pretertiary, certificate level course); the other staff member was enrolled to complete the same course during the first phase of the study. The 

118 
 
staff had worked with people with congenital deafblindness for an average of five years, 10 months (range = 22-154 months). See Table 2 for further 
information.

Rationale for time and place of observations in phase one 
Interactions with staff in the clients’ homes rather than their day services or with 
their families were selected for analysis as the adults with deafblindness spend 
more time with the staff in their houses than any other person. Consequently, it 
was asserted that the residential staff would be best positioned to interact with 
the participants and report on their behaviours and support needs.  
 
All the residents attend day services from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. 
Monday to Friday. Five of the nine adults with deafblindness have regular 
contact with their families, two have infrequent contact, and two have no 
contact, thus they have most interactions with staff who work in their homes. 
 
Observers  
Two observers coded the residents’ behaviour, including any interactions they 
had with staff. Observer 1 was a qualified speech pathologist with over 10 
years’ experience working with people with deafblindness and observer 2 was a 
psychology honours student. Observer-rater training included two meetings with 
the whole research team. The research team in phase one of the study 
consisted of myself, my two PhD supervisors, and a graduate student. The 
observation codes were discussed in light of examples drawn from the initial 
time spent in the houses videoing. In addition, the two coders independently 
coded seven video segments and compared their results in discussion.     
 
 

 
120 
 
Materials 
A JVC Everio hard disk camcorder was used to film the residents’ behaviour 
and coding was conducted post hoc using the observation schedule devised by 
Jones et al. (1999). The resident behaviours in this tool were: social 
engagement, nonsocial engagement—domestic, nonsocial engagement—
personal, 
nonsocial 
engagement—other, 
challenging 
behaviour, 
and 
disengagement (see Table 3a. for descriptions). Staff behaviours in the tool 
were: assistance, praise, restraint, other conversation, and processing (see 
Table 3b for descriptions). Disengagement was mutually exclusive of the social 
and nonsocial engagement codes. Each observer independently recorded 
behaviours defined in the coding system at every second of the 10-minute 
observation periods. Data were entered into a coding spreadsheet that broke 
the 10-minute sessions into one second intervals (or 600 seconds per 
observation). These data were subsequently analysed using the statistical 
software SPSS (IBM, 2008).    
 
 

 
121 
 
Table 3a: Observation codes for clients, adapted from Jones et al. (1999)  
Social engagement 
Comprised recognisable speech or attempts to speak, signs, 
gestures or other attempts to gain or retain the attention of another 
person (except by challenging behaviour), or the giving of 
attention, as evidenced by eye contact or orientation of the head, 
to another person who is reciprocally interacting. 
 
Nonsocial engagement 
—domestic 
Comprised getting ready for, doing, or clearing away, a household 
or gardening activity (e.g., washing clothes or setting the table). 
 
Nonsocial engagement 
—personal 
Comprised getting ready for, doing, or clearing away a self-help or 
personal activity (e.g., brushing teeth). 
 
Nonsocial engagement 
—other 
Comprised getting ready for, doing or clearing away a recreational 
activity (e.g., looking at a magazine) or educational activity, the 
content of which could not be coded under the two codes above 
(e.g., matching colours). 
 
Challenging behaviour 
Comprised self-injury, aggression to others, damage to property, 
stereotypy or other inappropriate behaviours (e.g., public 
masturbation, stripping, spitting, pica, tugging at someone or 
pestering/pushing/pulling a person). 
 
Disengagement 
Comprised all other behaviour (i.e., when not engaged socially, 
nonsocially or in challenging behaviour), including no activity, 
passively holding materials, walking/wandering outside of the 
context of an engagement activity, smoking and unpurposeful 
activity (e.g., manipulating materials to no apparent purpose, minor 
self-stimulation, talking quietly to self, fiddling with buttons or 
picking at clothing).

Assistance 
Comprised explicit instruction to perform an activity (e.g., “pick up 
the spoon”), implicit instruction (e.g., questions about what step of 
the activity comes next) or presentation of materials in the context 
of an activity (e.g., handing a resident a towel to dry their hands), 
gestural prompting of an activity (e.g., pointing to the tin to be put 
in the cupboard), demonstration (e.g., showing the person what to 
do and then prompting him or her to do it), physical prompting or 
guidance (e.g., giving hand over hand guidance as a resident 
pours a cup of tea), guiding or arranging the materials being used 
by the resident in an activity (e.g., holding an item steady on a 
chopping board as a resident cuts it), or giving corrective feedback 
containing guidance or instruction.

or “That's right” or patting a resident on the back). 
 
Restraint

physically preventing activity (e.g., saying “No”, holding a 
resident’s hands down or saying the resident's name in a 
controlling manner). 
 
Conversation 
Comprised all other interactions neither 
encouraging nor 
discouraging of activity (e.g., pleasantries). 
 
Processing 
Comprised doing something to a resident without assisting their 
participation (e.g., dressing a resident or holding a resident by the 
hand while walking).

Procedure 
Consent  
Given the complexity of the disability of participants and the extent of their 
support needs, consent was provided by guardians or family members who 
ordinarily acted in that capacity. Consent was also obtained for one resident 
who was not part of the study, but who could have inadvertently been filmed 
during data collection. 
 
Participant observation  
The decision to film staff–client interactions was made for two primary reasons.  
1. Interactions between staff and adults with deafblindness are often tactile in 
nature involving positioning of body parts, movement and varying degrees 
of strength or force. Interactions can be fleeting and subtle and filming them 
allows the opportunity to replay the footage repeatedly to analyse in finer 
detail what is happening in the interaction.  
2. Filming the interactions enables staff to observe them afterwards to 
stimulate their memory of the interaction and give the researcher further 
insight into what is happening in the interaction.  
 
Each participant with congenital deafblindness was filmed in half-hour blocks on 
varied days and in random order, over three-hour filming periods, starting in the 
afternoon from approximately 3:00 p.m. This time period was selected as staff 
suggested it was the most active time in the house. This was also consistent 
with the observation times used by Jones et al. (1999).  At the start of the study, 
each house was visited on two occasions in order for the researchers to meet 

 
124 
 
the residents and staff, and allow them to become desensitised to having 
someone filming; the data collected during this time was not included in the 
analysis. During the filming, staff were instructed to interact with residents as 
they would ordinarily.  
 
Filming took place in the shared areas within the homes (kitchen, dining room, 
lounge room, and outdoor area). Personal areas (bedroom, bathroom, and 
toilet) were not filmed, nor were any personal care routines (washing, toileting). 
Filming was not done in public or away from the home, and only occurred when 
two consenting staff members were working. This was in line with what had 
been approved by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Human 
Research Ethics Committee. 
 
Data analysis 
Thirty-four 30-minute observations were recorded over eight days of filming. 
See Table 4 for distribution of the data across participants. Only one video for 
Ben was coded as he spent most of the time in his bedroom which was an 
unfilmed area. Some additional footage was discarded (n = 12) where the 
segments were less than 15 minutes long (i.e., a resident left a shared area), 
the lighting was too low, or if the camera positioning was inadequate. The 10-
minute segments were taken from the 5- to 15-minute mark of the 30-minute 
observations. These time frames were selected to allow staff and residents a 
period of adjustment to the filming. 
 

 
125 
 
The initial observation periods to allow the participants time to become 
accustomed to being filmed also allowed the two observers who would code the 
videos an opportunity to observe the types of behaviours which were occurring 
and discuss how these would be coded. The coding schedule was discussed by 
the research team at length over two meetings to ensure the researchers were 
in agreement about how certain behaviours would be coded.  
 
It must be noted it is recognised there are various ways of constructing reality. 
This is why the current program of research has employed a mixed method 
design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The first 
phase of the study employed a quantitative observational coding strategy. The 
limitations of this approach are discussed and ameliorated through the use of 
qualitative strategies employed in the second phase of the study.

Phase one results  
Interrater reliability using percentage agreement  
Percentage agreement does not address reliability in the strict psychometric 
sense of true score variance and error variance. It does, however, address the 
inconsistency of measurements that can be attributed to differences between 
observers (Cordes, 1994). Percentage agreement was initially calculated by 
taking the number of agreements between observers and dividing these by the 
sum of agreements and disagreements between observers, multiplied by 100. 
This is a method frequently used in behavioural research (Cordes, 1994; 
Watkins & Pacheco, 2000).  
 
For the initial calculations, a random sample of seven videos from the 34, 
(approximately 20%) was used to calculate interrater reliability (or the 
percentage agreement between the two observers). Three different time 
intervals were used for observation to ascertain which gave the best result 
(highest percentage agreement). The time intervals used were: 1-second 
intervals across all codes observed concurrently; 2-second intervals across all 
codes observed concurrently; and 3-second intervals across all codes observed 
concurrently. 
 
The highest level of agreement was attained for 1-second intervals (88%), 
compared to 2-second (87%) and 3-second (86%) intervals. All subsequent 
calculations were made using 1-second time intervals, that is, agreement was 
calculated for every second of the 600-second videos.  
 

 
127 
 
Examination of the individual resident and staff codes at 1-second intervals 
including every second observed, that is, occurrence and nonoccurrence of the 
behaviour, resulted in high percentage agreement scores. Two codes achieved 
perfect interrater reliability and all were above 90% (see Table 5). 
 
However, the high level of agreement could have been accounted for by 
agreement on absence of occurrence of most staff and client behaviours. 
Sturmey’s (2009) investigation of the interrater reliability of the Functional 
Analysis Checklist similarly resulted in inflated percentage agreement due to 
large levels of agreement about the nonoccurrence of particular items on the 
coding tool. For this reason, percentage agreement was then calculated for 
occurrence only. That is, only 1-second intervals, where at least one rater noted 
the occurrence of a behaviour, were included in the calculations. Again, 
agreement was divided by agreement plus disagreement and multiplied by 100. 
This method of analysis resulted in a notably different profile of percentage 
agreement for the observations. Using this method, only three behavioural 
codes had acceptable levels of agreement, that is, over 60%, with two 
behavioural codes having 0% agreement (see Table 5). 
 
Finally, the potential impact on the results of disagreement resulting from slight 
variation in recording onset and end of behaviours between the two raters was 
investigated. The percentage agreement was calculated by comparing the total 
number of occurrences of each behaviour within the 600-second sample. This 
increased the percentage agreement for each code. But it did not change the 

 
128 
 
interpretation of the results based on the criteria proposed by Watkins and 
Pacheco (2000) (i.e., achieving a result of 0.6 or 60% or greater) for any of the 
codes (see Table 5). 
 
 
Of key interest is the substantial variation in results depending on how 
percentage agreement is calculated. Probable reasons for this variation and key 
considerations for future research are presented later in this chapter.

The second observer, as part of her Psychology Honours thesis, calculated 
percentage agreement for just the original sample of seven videos (i.e., 20% of 
the videos available) used initially to determine which time interval resulted in 

 
129 
 
the highest percentage agreement score. A comparison of the results from the 
total data set with the results of the sample of seven is shown in Table 6. While 
there is some evidence of concurrence between the findings based on the 
sample and those of the total data set (e.g., nonsocial—domestic and social), in 
most instances there are substantial discrepancies (e.g., nonsocial—other, 
processing, conversation, and praise).

Interrater reliability using Cohen’s kappa    
Interrater reliability was also calculated using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960). 
Cohen’s kappa provides an estimate of agreement between two independent 
observers, taking into account levels of chance agreement (Portney & Watkins, 
2000). It is important to note that out of the 34 video segments only kappa 

 
130 
 
scores for behaviours coded within each video segment were calculated. If 
neither rater observed any instances of challenging behaviour during a 
particular video segment, the kappa for challenging behaviour for that video was 
not calculated.   
 
While a total of 90 behaviours were recorded, kappa could only be calculated 
for 67 of these, as in 23 instances one of the variables was a constant. In such 
cases kappa can sometimes be calculated by adding weighted variables so that 
there are no constants. However, due to the extreme distribution of data, when 
this approach was tried even adding the weighted variables did not give 
sufficient variance in the data to calculate kappa. This was also the case for 
perfect agreement, instances of which were given a default kappa value of 1. 
See Table 5 for kappa values for the resident and staff behaviours.  
 
It is suggested that a kappa value of 0.6 or higher is acceptable for 
observational research (Suen & Ary, 1989; Watkins & Pacheco, 2000). 
Therefore, the occurrence of disengagement, non-social-personal and non-
social-domestic activities could be reliably distinguished. Kappa for resident 
behaviours coded as non-social-other and challenging behaviour fell below the 
criteria recommended. For staff behaviours, kappa values were all lower than 
0.6, and so should be interpreted with caution. See Table 5 for a summary of 
kappa scores. 
 

 
131 
 
Resident and staff behaviour 
While data from the two observers was used to calculate interrater reliability, 
only the data recorded by the first observer will be reported in this section of the 
results. Typically only a sample of the full data set is used to calculate interrater 
reliability, thus only data from one observer are used when reporting the 
topography of behaviours. In this instance, while two full data sets were 
available, given the high overall percentage agreement between the two 
observers, it was deemed reasonable to use only the primary researcher’s data 
set when looking at participant behaviours. 
  
The most frequently observed resident behaviour was disengagement at 85%, 
followed by non-social-personal engagement at 13%, and challenging 
behaviour at nine percent. Challenging behaviour was often coded at the same 
time as other behaviours. This is why adding all the average percentages 
together did not achieve a sum of 100% of time observed. Total resident 
engagement 
(social 
engagement, 
non-social-personal/other/domestic 
engagement) was 15%.  
 
Total staff engagement (assistance, restraint, praise, other, conversation, 
processing) accounted for less than two percent of the observations. 
Interactions between residents and staff were observed in only 10 out of the 34, 
10-minute sessions (i.e., 30%). The most frequently observed staff behaviour 
during interactions was assistance (0.8% of total observed time), followed by 
processing (0.2% of total observed time). Praise was not observed in any 

 
132 
 
session. See Tables 5, 7a and 7b and 9 for results summaries. See Appendix C 
for a sample of the data sheets.

One of the aims of this study was to compare the engagement and interaction 
of adults with congenital deafblindness with their peers with severe intellectual 
disabilities with whom they often share services. Table 8 shows results from the 

 
133 
 
current study compared with the results from the study conducted by Jones et 
al. (1999) using the same coding schedule. The different profiles of engagement 
between the participants in the current study and the research conducted by 
Jones et al. (1999) are discussed below.

Discussion  
Aims of phase one  
The following are the principal aims of phase one of the study.  
1.  To evaluate the utility of an existing observation coding system, previously 
used in relation to the experiences of adults with intellectual disabilities in 
community residences.  
2.  To document the topography of the behaviours and interactions of adults 
with congenital deafblindness.    
 
Discussion relating to the first aim of phase one of the study 
Interrater reliability  
The utility of the Jones et al. (1999) tool was investigated in terms of interrater 
reliability. Interrater reliability was assessed using the coded data from two 
raters from different disciplines (speech pathology and psychology). Given the 

 
134 
 
discrete nature of the observations, and the potential for difficulty observing 
these behaviours in the participant population, observations were video 
recorded.  
 
Comparison between interrater reliability using percentage agreement and Cohen’s 
kappa 
The results from phase one of this investigation, similar to Sturmey’s (2009) 
analysis of the reliability of the Functional Analysis Checklist, revealed inflated 
overall interrater reliability using percentage agreement. This was due to high 
levels of agreement about nonoccurrence of behaviours. Again, like Sturmey’s 
(2009) study, when interrater reliability was recalculated using occurrence only 
or Cohen’s kappa, the agreement between raters diminished markedly. There 
was a large variation in results between percentage agreement calculated using 
both occurrence and nonoccurrence of behaviours, and Cohen’s kappa, and 
marked high levels of agreement around nonoccurrence of behaviours. This 
signalled the need to calculate percentage agreement in other ways.  
 
Reporting an interobserver percentage agreement figure is not sufficient in itself 
to establish the reliability of observational data (Cordes, 1994). Regardless of 
an overall percentage agreement figure, further analysis will always be required 
to best evaluate the reliability of a study. This is highlighted in this investigation 
by the broad variability in the results depending on the method used to calculate 
interobserver reliability.  
 

 
135 
 
While calculating percentage agreement using occurrences only, it was noted 
that one rater often perceived the onset of behaviour one second before or one 
second after the other observer. Notwithstanding this, there was general 
agreement between the two raters about an episode of a particular behaviour. 
For this reason, to take into account variation in perception of onset and ending 
of behaviour, percentage agreement was calculated using overall number of 
occurrences, rather than occurrences second by second. (See the section on 
analysis using percentage agreement.) While this approach did not increase the 
level of acceptability of the results of any of the behaviour codes (i.e., achieving 
a result above 0.6 or 60%), it did increase them all and potentially could alter 
the interpretation of results.  
 
It should also be noted that several different ways of calculating kappa have 
been developed (Randolph, 2005). These variations have been proposed to 
address the paradox of apparent high levels of agreement in data, but 
comparatively poor kappa scores. These paradoxical results have been 
attributed to observer bias and the disproportionate use of particular 
observation codes, the latter phenomena being evident in the current data set. 
 
Interrater reliability using Cohen’s kappa was found to be variable from code to 
code. Three resident behaviours had very high levels of interrater reliability: 
disengagement, non-social-personal, and non-social-domestic. These three 
behavioural codes all achieved interrater reliability of > 0.89. The other two 
resident codes, and all staff codes, were < 0.48.  Interrater reliability could be 

 
136 
 
increased to an acceptable level by trimming off the first and last seconds of the 
staff-client interactions when using percentage agreement. Originally, the 
coding system was designed for use with adults with severe intellectual 
disabilities. These data suggest that the coding system also has some merit for 
observing and documenting the behaviours and interactions of adults with 
congenital deafblindness. However, inferences based on analysis of the 
interactions directly between staff and residents should be made with caution 
due to the comparatively low level of interrater reliability. It is anticipated that 
higher interrater reliability would be achieved with slight variations in the 
parameters of some codes, particularly challenging behaviour and non-social-
other engagement. This is discussed later in this chapter.  
 
Issues with sampling data 
Most quantitative studies take a sample of results when calculating interrater 
reliability. The current study found that a sample of seven coded videos, 
approximately 20% of the data set, revealed different results to those achieved 
when all the data were taken into account. One behaviour observed in three 
videos was coded differently by each observer, substantially reducing the 
overall agreement.  In the sample of seven videos, this particular behaviour was 
not observed at all by either observer, thus not providing an accurate reflection 
of the entire data set.  
 
This first phase of the study raises questions around the construct validity, that 
is, the ability of a tool to measure an abstract concept or construct (Portney & 
Watkins, 2000). The coding tool originally devised by Jones et al. (1999) was 

 
137 
 
found to have satisfactory reliability with both English and Australian 
populations of adults with severe intellectual disabilities (Jones et al., 1999; 
Stancliffe et al., 2007). The reasons this tool was used in the current study with 
adults with congenital deafblindness are set out earlier in this chapter. However, 
a number of issues were revealed when using the tool with a different 
population, which impacted on its reliability in the study.   
 
Of particular concern was the client code disengagement and the staff codes 
assistance and processing. In three videos one client was seen briefly exploring 
and then casting toys from a box. These behaviours were consistent with the 
description in the coding tool of disengagement. However, one rater recognised 
the behaviour as being developmentally appropriate engagement and coded the 
behaviour as non-social-other. This significantly reduced the agreement 
between observers in these three videos. It is important to be mindful that data 
obtained from direct observation may depend as much on the behaviour of the 
observers as on the behaviour of the subjects (Cordes, 1994), as evidenced in 
the above example.  
 
In addition, interactions between staff and clients are often tactile. Determining 
whether a staff member is fully acting upon (as in the code processing) or 
assisting the client can be more difficult with adults with congenital 
deafblindness than it is with adults with severe intellectual disabilities who can 
see and hear. There are three potential ways to address this issue. First, the 
criteria for each behaviour code could undergo modifications if the tool is to be 

 
138 
 
used with a population who are deafblind. Second, more attention could be paid 
to these issues when training the observers. Third, a consensus coding 
approach could be taken. Consensus coding is discussed later in this chapter.  
 
The issue with the construct validity of the codes in the tool also highlights the 
need to always calculate reliability code by code, rather than simply calculating 
global reliability. This is because problems can only be revealed by the code 
during code calculations (Cissna, Garvin, & Kennedy, 1990). Cordes (1994) 
also highlights the importance of evaluating both the reliability and validity of 
observational data to determine how meaningful and interpretable the results 
are. Cordes (1994) points out that two raters could score inaccurately and still 
show high agreement as they may both be inaccurate in the same way. There is 
no point to being reliable if the validity or underlying premise of what is being 
measured is flawed.   
 
Potential benefits of consensus coding   
In observational studies the better the description of target behaviour the better 
the observational data, but very specific behaviours require extensive observer 
training (Suen & Ary, 1989). For adults with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities, and those with congenital deafblindness, it can be difficult to train 
observers in the full range of an individual’s behaviours and what they might 
mean in different contexts. This poses challenges to adequately calibrating the 
observers in order to achieve acceptable levels of interobserver agreement.  
 

 
139 
 
As stated earlier, percentage agreement is commonly used to estimate inter- 
rater reliability in observational studies. However, when interpreting reports of 
percentage agreement of calculations it is often unclear what defined an 
opportunity for an agreement or how different judgements were compared. 
Consensus coding on the other hand may lead to an increased awareness of 
the extent and location of disagreements between observers, and even provide 
explanations and possible solutions to these disagreements (Cordes, 1994).  
 
Consensus coding shows promise as a means of improving interobserver 
agreement. It also potentially provides an opportunity to gain greater insights 
and learning about the interactions of adults with idiosyncratic behaviours, such 
as those with congenital deafblindness. Roch (2006) investigated rating 
accuracy in the context of group rating and found the anticipation of group 
discussion and the process of reaching consensus positively influenced rating 
accuracy. Roch (2006) also posits that consensus may produce more valid 
results. In the current study, had the two observers had the opportunity to 
discuss the toy casting behaviour of one of the participants, the construct 
validity of the coding tool could have been challenged. As a result, substantially 
higher agreement may have been achieved on the code non-social-other 
engagement. Consensus coding ostensibly seems the least scientific approach 
in light of benchmarks set out by government organisations, such as the 
National Health and Medical Research Council. The Council argues for 
randomised control trials as providing the highest quality of evidence (National 
Health and Medical Research Council, 1998, 2009). However, if undertaken 

 
140 
 
with clear parameters, consensus coding can be done in a rigorous and 
scientific manner. It may yield greater insights and learning, and increase 
reliability without losing trustworthiness.  
 
The Scale for Dialogical Meaning Making (S-DMM) was discussed in chapter 
two as a potential means of operationalising and evaluating opportunities for 
experiencing the good life. It highlights the potential value of using a consensus 
coding approach. In their study evaluating the efficacy of the S-DMM Hostyn, 
Daelman, Janssen & Maes (2010) outline a rigorous initial observer training 
process similar to other observational studies not employing consensus coding 
(e.g., Janssen et al., 2004; Vervloed et al., 2006). The training included a review 
of the theoretical background of the S-DMM and practice coding videos not 
included in the study. The observers were then given specific information about 
the people in the videos they would be coding, such as their typical ways of 
expressing satisfaction, dissatisfaction, engagement and disengagement. The 
two observers then independently coded the videos in the study, but unlike 
other observational studies, the observers noted down qualitative reasoning for 
their coding. This made the coding process replicable to a degree. Following the 
observers’ independent coding, they compared and discussed both similar and 
differing scores, as well as their justification for each, and finally a shared score 
was agreed upon. This process was audio taped. Through this approach, 
interrater reliability can be ascertained using the scores given by each observer 
prior to the negotiation phase and then compared with the postnegotiation 

 
141 
 
scores. The advantage is that more is learnt about the coding process from 
reviewing the discussion between the two observers. 
 
A further distinct advantage of consensus coding over more straight quantitative 
coding approaches is its mixed method orientation. Mixed method approaches 
can potentially elicit new knowledge and test and verify this knowledge in the 
challenging context of research and evaluation in the field of intellectual 
disability (McVilly, Stancliffe, Parmenter, & Burton-Smith, 2008).  While there 
are some clear benefits to using consensus coding to achieve interobserver 
agreement, Cordes (1994) argues that it shares the same limitations as other 
measures. Consequently, its use in combination with other analyses appears 
advisable.  
 
Additional methodological and theoretical issues associated with phase one 
In terms of the coding system, the resident code nonsocial engagement-
personal almost exclusively involved mealtimes. (This code encompasses 
preparing for, doing, or cleaning up after a personal self-help activity.) This can 
be attributed to the filming occurring within the shared living areas of the homes 
and excluding personal areas and personal care activities. Had filming not been 
restricted to specific areas within the residences, the level of nonsocial 
engagement-personal, and the frequency and length of interactions between 
the staff and residents, might have been higher. Anecdotal evidence from the 
researcher who conducted the filming indicated that Ben spent most time in the 
nonfilmed areas of the house, only coming into the shared areas for mealtimes. 
This might account for the lack of disengagement and preponderance of 

 
142 
 
nonsocial engagement—personal (i.e., mealtimes) of Ben relative to the other 
residents.  
 
One rater coded Brett as engaging in non-social-other behaviour in three 
separate videos; the other rater did not use this code at all for this participant.  
The behaviour which the rater coded as non-social-other, was removing 
children’s toys from a box, exploring them briefly and then casting them away. 
The coding category disengagement includes nonpurposeful manipulation of 
objects (Jones et al., (1999). Brief exploration and casting away of toys would 
therefore fit within this definition. However, given the developmental level of the 
participant and the nature of the objects being manipulated, his actions could 
also be viewed as developmentally appropriate engagement. Similarly, Belle 
spent some time in some of the videos tapping different objects against her 
body. Both raters coded this as disengagement. However, taking into 
consideration her level of development and profound vision and hearing deficits, 
this behaviour could be interpreted as engagement. Additional work is required 
to fine tune the coding categories with regard to engagement. The aim should 
be to more clearly acknowledge abilities consistent with the psycho-social 
developmental levels of adults with congenital deafblindness and also the 
idiosyncratic nature of their behaviours.  
 
The two raters also showed marked variation in their coding of social behaviour, 
highlighting the problematic nature of this particular coding category when 
observing adults with congenital deafblindness. The lack of agreement on this 

 
143 
 
particular code resulted in no kappa value being calculated for it. Only six 
instances of social behaviour were coded, all of which were recorded by one 
rater alone. Given the idiosyncratic nature of the behaviours of adults with 
congenital deafblindness, it is recommended that future studies adjust the 
description of the code social to recognise individual differences. These should 
be discussed thoroughly prior to commencing the coding process.  
 
Phase one of the study employed video recordings to capture the behaviour of 
adults with congenital deafblindness and support staff. The recordings were 
subsequently watched and coded by two observers. In contrast, Jones et al. 
(1999) coded the observations in real time using Psion palmtop computers 
programmed to capture the 11 behaviour codes. An advantage of the approach 
used in the current study was the ability to replay the footage to accurately code 
the behaviours. Live coding, despite its less intrusive nature, may reduce 
precision. It requires a high level of focused attention from the observers, 
compared with video recordings. Furthermore, considering the idiosyncratic and 
discrete nature of some of the observations, capturing these on video allows for 
additional analyses using consensus coding techniques. The application of 
consensus coding to these data, possibly involving direct support staff as 
observers, could be the subject of a further study.      
 
In relation to the sample, the small number of participants, though typical of 
deafblind studies (Parker et al., 2007), prevented data analysis using inferential 
statistics. Therefore the present study is limited to being descriptive in nature. 

 
144 
 
Discussion relating to the second aim of phase one of the study 
Staff/client behaviours  
A second aim of the first phase of the study was to identify the topography of 
the interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness and the staff who 
support them. The adults with congenital deafblindness were predominantly 
observed to be disengaged according to the parameters of the coding schedule. 
The lack of involvement in activity, social or nonsocial, was notably high, 
particularly relative to the level of engagement of the participants in the Jones et 
al. (1999) study at their baseline (preintervention) measure. For comparisons, 
see Table 8. 
 
Nonsocial engagement-personal and challenging behaviour were the second 
and third highest occurring resident behaviour categories, respectively. 
However, even these categories of behaviour were considerably lower than 
disengagement.  
 
It is reasonable to suggest that there might only be a moderate level of 
nonsocial engagement-personal observed due to filming occurring late in the 
afternoon. Therefore, this finding is not surprising. However, the relatively high 
levels of challenging behaviour during this time-predominantly head hitting and 
rocking back and forth, constituting almost 10% of the observation time- 
warrants further investigation. Such analyses could inform the focus of 
interventions designed specifically to increase and enhance social engagement, 
or opportunities to experience the good life. Techniques could be used like 
those in approaches such as: Co-creating Communication (see Nafstad & 

 
145 
 
Rodbroe, 1999), Intensive Interaction (see Nind and Hewitt, 1994) and the 
guidelines outlined by Rodbroe and Janssen (2006a, 2006b).   
 
Total resident engagement (comprising the social and three nonsocial 
engagement codes) accounted for 15.13% of the overall observations. This is in 
contrast to the findings of Jones et al. (1999) who reported an average 33.1% 
total resident engagement (range = 23-38%) at the baseline level of their 
intervention study. It is important to note that the sample used in the Jones et al. 
(1999) study consisted of 19 adults with severe intellectual disabilities, only five 
of whom were described as having sensory impairments. The degree to which 
sensory impairment alone affects levels of engagement and the effects of a staff 
training intervention on levels of engagement for adults with congenital 
deafblindness is yet to be investigated.  
 
Total staff engagement with the residents was negligible across all observation 
categories, with assistance, restraint, other conversation and processing each 
accounting for less than one per cent of the observations. Praise was not 
observed on any occasion. It was noted that the code for conversation was only 
used in relation to three clients known to have hearing assessed as adequate to 
perceive speech. Verbal acts on the part of staff were coded this way. None of 
the clients who were reported to be deaf had interactions with staff that met 
criteria to be coded as conversation, though the code was sufficiently broad as 
to include nonverbal conversation. Interestingly, in the second phase of the 
study, staff offer accounts of more social tactile interactions with the adults with 

 
146 
 
deafblindness. This significant discrepancy between the two data sets is 
examined in chapter seven. 
 
The frequency and length of the interactions between the staff and residents 
was relatively low. On average, each 10-minute session contained one 
interaction that lasted approximately eight seconds. It is feasible that this might 
be attributed to staff feeling discomfort being filmed and therefore avoiding 
interaction with the resident under observation. However, by visiting each house 
on two occasions prior to collecting usable data, it was anticipated that staff 
would become desensitised to having someone filming in the house. 
Furthermore, by analysing the 5- to 15-minute segment from the 30-minute 
observations, it was predicted that the initial 5-minute buffer would allow the 
staff and residents to adjust to being filmed. All staff who took part in this 
investigation reported that what had been filmed was typical and that their 
behaviour had changed very little, if at all, due to being filmed. This was 
reported during interviews conducted after filming that involved explicit reflection 
about the filmed segments. 
 
Implications and recommendations from phase one 
The coding system devised by Jones et al. (1999) for the observation of adults 
with severe intellectual disabilities living in community residences was found to 
have variable reliability. The low reliability score for interactions between staff 
and residents highlighted the discrete nature of the participants’ behaviour and 
subsequent difficulties associated with coding such complex human behaviours.   

 
147 
 
 
The findings from phase one highlighted the lack of resident involvement in 
activities and a paucity of (social) interaction with staff. Practice solutions to 
increase the frequency, duration and quality of staff–client interactions, and the 
subsequent effect of these on the residents’ quality of life, or potential 
experience of the good life warrant investigation. The current findings highlight 
the need for further work on observation tools to establish baseline measures 
for an intervention study. The study should be designed to increase levels of 
social activity and interaction among adults with congenital deafblindness. 
 
 

 
148 
 
Recommendations 
Seven recommendations for future studies are made based on the findings from 
phase one of the study.  
1. That interrater reliability be calculated using both percentage agreement and 
kappa, then, if there is large variation between the two, calculate percentage 
agreement using only occurrences.  
2. That for sequential observational studies, percentage agreement be 
calculated using number of occurrences of each behaviour overall, 
regardless of the time interval they occur at, as a reasonable means to allow 
for slight human variation which potentially lowers the significance of the 
findings.  
3. That if a sample of the entire data set is to be used, the entire data set 
should be scanned to see if there are any major variations between 
observers on any given code. Caution should be exercised when evaluating 
the merits of observational studies that use a sample of the results rather 
than the entire data set.   
4. If the coding system is to be used again with adults with congenital 
deafblindness, it is recommended that the parameters describing each 
coding category be adjusted slightly to take into consideration the 
participants’ level of psycho-social development and the idiosyncratic ways 
in which adults with congenital deafblindness engage with themselves, 
others and the environment. 
5. Consensus coding should be considered for use in observational studies of 
populations which use idiosyncratic, context dependent behaviours.  

 
149 
 
6. Longer observation periods and/or observation periods at different times of 
the day should be considered. This recommendation is also made by 
Correa-Torres (2008) with regard to observations of the interactions of 
students with deafblindness in classrooms.  
7. An intervention such as the Hanging Out Program (Forster, 2008) should be 
considered. It suggests staff spend 10 minutes with a client giving them their 
full attention, then reflecting on what worked well in the interaction, what did 
not work so well, and what might be tried in future. Such a process would 
ensure adults with congenital deafblindness receive more consistent and 
sustained attention from staff than they were observed to in this phase of the 
study.  
 
Rationale for phase two  
The above recommendations could be applied to future studies employing 
quantitative observational research methods. Nevertheless, this phase of the 
study does not satisfactorily address some of the overarching aims of the study, 
thus presenting the need to consider alternative research methods. While this 
phase of the study reveals low levels of staff–client interaction, it gives no 
insight as to why these levels are so low. Notes taken during the filming periods 
indicate that initially staff requested direction from the researcher and appeared 
somewhat uncomfortable with the low levels of interaction and client 
engagement. The staff commented that not much usually happens at that time 
of the day and asked whether the researcher wanted them to do something in 
particular. These observations raise a number of questions: how do staff 

 
150 
 
perceive what is occurring during the observation periods, what are staff 
perceptions of their interactions with the adults they support, and can a better 
understanding of staff perspectives help explain the low levels of interaction 
observed?  Further work is required for these questions to be answered. 
 
Given the lack of literature investigating the interactions of adults with 
congenital deafblindness, valuable insights can be gained from the research on 
interactions between people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities 
and their support staff. This literature is considered both relevant and important 
for three reasons. First, many adults with congenital deafblindness, like adults 
with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, express themselves primarily 
through idiosyncratic nonsymbolic means. Second, their communication 
partners are often primarily disability support workers (Forster & Iacono, 2008; 
Golden & Reese, 1996). Third, in the research literature on interactions with 
people with congenital deafblindness and people with profound intellectual and 
multiple 
disabilities 
there 
is 
evidence 
of 
missed 
opportunities 
for 
communication, communication breakdowns, and limited engagement in social 
interaction (Clegg et al., 1991b; Finlay et al., 2008; Golden & Reese, 1996; 
Healy & Noonan Walsh, 2007; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991). These findings 
have important implications for people with congenital deafblindness and their 
experience of personal relationships and social engagement. These 
experiences are imperative to a person’s quality of life (Felce & Perry, 1996b; 
Petry et al., 2005) and indeed their experience of the good life (cf. J. S. 
Reinders, 2002).  

 
151 
 
As well as drawing upon literature from a different but related area, there is a 
need to take a different methodological approach to investigating staff–client 
interactions in order to adequately address the nature of the questions being 
posed. There are increasing numbers of observation based studies 
investigating staff-client interactions, as interpreted by researchers (e.g., Clegg 
et al., 1991a, 1991b; Janssen et al., 2003a; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991; 
Vervloed et al., 2006). Very few of these have involved the staff as direct 
informants, giving them an opportunity to express what is happening in the 
interaction from their perspective. In an evaluation of quality enhancing 
interventions for people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities Maes, 
Lambrechts, Hostyn and Petry (2007) found that none addressed whether the 
interventions were compatible with the values and priorities of staff. That is, if 
they had ecological validity, and if so how staff were motivated to utilise the 
interventions. The limited evidence available indicates that how staff perceive 
and make sense of their role can influence their interactions with their clients. 
Consequently, these staff perceptions require further investigation.

Chapter Six: Phase two 
 
This chapter presents the research design, procedure and findings from the 
second phase of the study. The findings are discussed in light of the first phase 
of the study, the literature, and my experiences and observations. Much of the 
content of this chapter has been published in the article “Interacting with adults 
with congenital deafblindness: the experience of disability support workers” (M. 
Prain, McVilly, & Ramcharan, 2012b). However, due to constraints around word 
limits, the article focused on the following research questions which arose from 
a review of the literature and the results from the first phase of the study.  
1. What are the perspectives of staff on their interactions with adults with 
congenital deafblindness? 
2. How do accounts by staff of their interactions with adults with congenital 
deafblindness contribute to an understanding of the limited interactions 
observed in quantitative studies?  
 
This chapter adds to what was presented in the article by examining the 
concept of tacit knowledge in relationship to the good life for adults with 
congenital deafblindness. It also raises some additional key points about 
communication from analysis of the data. The chapter concludes with an 
examination of the quality of the qualitative work undertaken in this second 
phase of the study.  
 

 
153 
 
Design of phase two  
The first phase of the study used quantitative methods to investigate the form, 
frequency and duration of interactions between adults with congenital 
deafblindness and their support staff (see M. Prain et al., 2010). The second 
phase addressed different questions. These required qualitative research 
methods to generate adequate data. A number of authors have argued for the 
need to improve our understanding of the perspectives of interaction partners of 
people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities and those with 
congenital deafblindness (see Maes et al., 2007; Parker et al., 2007). For this 
reason, semistructured interviews were selected as the most appropriate 
research method to address the research aims. A concurrent advantage of 
using interviews as the research method is their inherent facility for offering 
opportunities for reflection upon work practices. The benefits of this were 
highlighted in chapter three during the discussion about the insights that can be 
gained from Intensive Interaction practices.  
 
Ethics  
As documented previously in chapters four and five, this study was approved by 
the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University Human Research Ethics 
Committee. 
 
Participants 
The criteria for inclusion in the second phase of the study were that the 
participants were staff members supporting adults with congenital deaf 

 
154 
 
blindness. For the purpose of the ethics application, those persons supported 
by the staff, namely adults with congenital deaf blindness, were also considered 
participants.   
 
Disability support workers 
The same nine disability support workers who participated in the first phase of 
the study were invited to participate in the second phase. All but one agreed to 
participate in the second phase, leaving eight participants: four from house one 
and four from house two. The number of staff interviewed represented 80% of 
the entire potential of permanent staff working across the two houses.  
 
Six participants were female and two were male. Age range was between 24 
and 59 years (M = 31 years, 5 months SD = 12 years, 9 months). Both males 
worked in house one. All eight staff had completed a Certificate IV in Disability 
Studies (a pretertiary, national vocational certificate level course). Their 
experience working with people with congenital deafblindness varied from 22 to 
154 months. See Table 9 for details of the staff who participated in this phase of 
the study.

Adults with congenital deafblindness 
The same nine adults with congenital deafblindness who participated in the first 
phase of the study participated indirectly in phase two in that staff interactions 
with these individuals were the topic of discussion during the interviews. See 
Table 1 for details of the adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 
Interview procedure  
The eight staff participants were interviewed to gain their perspectives on their 
interactions with the adults they supported. A semi structured interview was 

 
156 
 
deemed the best method to address the research questions. This method 
involves researchers developing an interview guide to address a specific topic 
of enquiry. It is more flexible than a survey style interview which can reduce 
comparability of interviews within the study, but results in a better understanding 
of the informants’ perceptions (Minichiello, Aroni, Timewell, & Alexander, 1995). 
The issue of comparability of interviews is addressed at the end of this chapter 
when discussing credibility and resonance of the results. 
 
An interview schedule, which consisted of eight open-ended questions (see 
Appendix D), was designed to guide the interview but also allow the participants 
to give rich descriptions of their work with adults with congenital deafblindness. 
Assistance was sought from an experienced qualitative researcher not involved 
in the research project to devise the interview schedule. This ensured the 
schedule was free of leading terminology. Examples of the questions asked are: 
tell me about your last shift, tell me about time you spent with Belle during your 
last shift, tell me about other times you've spent with Belle.    
 
Towards the end of the interview, all but three of the staff member participants 
were shown video footage in which they were interacting with the adults with 
congenital deafblindness with whom they work. “The immediate nature of the 
videotape captures emotional nuances, embodied perceptions, spatial 
influences, relational understandings, situational factors and temporal 
manifestations” (Raingruber, 2003, p. 1155). Given the nonverbal nature of 
many interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness, video cued 

 
157 
 
reflection is a useful tool to elicit information which most likely would not be 
yielded through interview alone. 
 
 The video footage had been obtained during the earlier phase of the study and 
was used to prompt the staff to recall their interactions and give a description 
from their perspective of their interactions. General prompts were used, for 
example, “Can you talk me through what is happening here?” Three of the eight 
participants did not view video footage of themselves due to inadequate audio 
visual facilities in the house. These staff were given a brief, broad description of 
an interaction which the researcher had observed and were asked to talk the 
researcher through the interaction in more detail. 
 
Six of the interviews took place in the house where the staff member worked 
either immediately prior to or following a shift. Two of the interviews took place 
at the head office of the organisation where the staff were employed, as at the 
time of interviewing two of the staff had been promoted to team leader roles and 
were not working in the houses. (See Appendix E for a sample interview.) 
  
Each interview was audio recorded and lasted approximately half an hour. The 
audio recorded interviews were then transcribed and imported to NVivo Version 
8 (QSR International, 2008) by me.     
 
 

 
158 
 
Interview analysis procedure 
Analysis was conducted using NVivo software and the approach outlined by 
Charmaz  (2006). However, theoretical sampling was not employed, making the 
process more consistent with thematic analysis (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). 
The sampling was designed to address the questions raised by the first phase 
of the study. Given the relatively small number of staff who provide dedicated 
support to adults with congenital deafblindness, the potential participant 
population for the current study was limited. Consequently, there was 
insufficient data available to generate a single generalisable theory which 
Charmaz (2003) might identify as substantive or formal grounded theory. 
However, adopting Charmaz’s approach provided a robust framework to elicit 
important conceptual and practical issues that addressed the topic of inquiry. In 
the results section of this chapter I present details of the themes arising from 
the data and provide direction for professional development for direct support 
staff. My two PhD supervisors independently reviewed my analysis and the final 
results were derived from a consensus approach involving myself and my 
supervisors. The key steps in the process were:  
- 
several readings of the data to obtain an holistic perspective 
- 
initial themes were identified, clustered and checked against data, 
research literature, and my observations  
- 
a working hypothesis was induced from the themes  
- 
constant comparison between data, observations and literature was 
undertaken to test and refine the hypothesis. 

 
159 
 
Using this process, themes were recorded in the NVivo software as free nodes. 
Coded material was then grouped into broader themes. Free nodes were 
grouped into organised catalogues (tree nodes) after multiple rounds of fine 
tuning the coding of themes. Text search queries were run on key words in the 
themes, such as happy, to ensure all the data segments on this theme were 
explored. Memos were created and sorted during the coding process as 
described by Charmaz (2006) to assist the analytical process. (See Appendix F 
for coded categories induced using NVivo.)  
Rigour of the methodology  
Lincoln and Guba (1985) recommend a number of strategies to strengthen 
rigour and credibility of findings in naturalistic inquiry. These include prolonged 
engagement (in the current instance I had worked with people with congenital 
deafblindness in their homes for 15 years), persistent observation (inherent in 
the analysis process as described above), and triangulation through use of 
different sources and methods.  
As discussed in the previous chapter, the perspectives of disability support 
workers are largely lacking from the scientific literature. Frankham (2009) raises 
three problems relating to disability service users as informants in research 
which are equally applicable to disability support workers. These are: 
 - 1. that one person may be viewed as representing the group and this need 
not be the case; 

 
160 
 
- 2. that because they have had the experience they are assumed to 
understand the experience beyond just describing it; and  
- 3. if the stories and accounts of informants in research are not questioned, 
information about how experiences and realities are constructed will be missed.   
In the current study, the first two points have been addressed through elements 
of the methodology which were developed to increase the credibility and 
resonance of the study. These will be discussed at length at the end of this 
chapter.  
The third point, however, is a critical issue for research and practice involving 
both scientist practitioners and disability support workers working with adults 
with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, and those with congenital 
deafblindness. It is important to reflect upon the epistemological frameworks 
and broader social and cultural context which influence the perspectives of 
disability support workers. This will be discussed in more detail in the following 
chapter when exploring the concept of relational agency (Edwards, 2009) as a 
process to facilitate collaboration between different professionals.  
This second qualitative phase elucidates findings from the first quantitative 
phase of the study, as well as the current scientific literature and the 
researcher’s observations. 
Phase two results 
While a grounded theory methodology was employed in this study, it was not 
possible to generate a single generalisable theory. This was largely due to the 

 
161 
 
small sample size which was restricted because of the nature of the population 
being investigated. Through analysis of the data three themes were formulated: 
(1) 
the 
construction 
of 
client 
happiness; 
(2) 
accounting 
for 
client 
disengagement; and (3) imperatives of the staff role.  
 
Theme 1-The construction of client happiness 
Underpinned by staff’s tacit knowledge of the adults they support, the theme the 
construction of client happiness was induced as a factor important to staff. It 
influences how they interact with the adults with congenital deafblindness. All 
staff described how the adults they supported expressed happiness. For 
example, “You tell by all her noises now that she’s happy” (Christine about 
Annie), and “Well with Ben, when he’s happy he’ll giggle and laugh and smile” 
(James about Ben). All staff also described activities and events which they 
asserted made the clients happy. For example, “ … you kind of just have to you 
know stick to her routine to keep her happy” (Kate about Ada), and “Oh happy 
face. He likes the shower so he can stay in the water as long as he wants” 
(Jenny about Ben, when asked to elaborate on how she knows he likes the 
shower).   
 
However, staff were not always able to determine the moods and preferences of 
the adults with whom they worked. Six staff expressed uncertainty in reading 
the clients’ body language. This is significant as it is the tacit knowledge of the 
clients’ idiosyncratic behaviours which appears to guide staff responses. 
Uncertainty in knowing how best to respond could impact on the staff–client 

 
162 
 
relationship. Examples of this uncertainty included: “it’s a lot of guess work” 
(Joe, in response to the question, “Do you feel pretty confident you can always 
judge their (responses)?”), and “Ada’s a really hard one to interact with because 
she doesn’t really show emotions” (Christine about Ada). 
 
In response to different questions throughout their interviews, three staff stated 
that the adults with congenital deafblindness were generally happy. In response 
to the question, “Is there anything else you think is important to add, or anything 
you’d like to add about working with this group?” Christine answered, “Um, no 
not really. I just really think they’re happy, our clients”.  
 
Similarly, Joe was asked, “And how do you think that shift (his most recent shift 
at work) was for the clients?” Joe responded by saying, “Routine. I think they 
like the routine. I think it goes quite routinely for them and it makes them happy 
and comfortable, they know what’s coming and they know what they’re 
doing.  Everything’s provided and they’re happy”. 
 
Three staff also stated that they felt clients were happy based on a lack of 
behaviours perceived as negative, exemplified by the descriptions: “… not 
huffing, not upset” (Carla about Ada), and “… not fidgety or anxious, not acting 
abnormal” (Jane generally about the clients).    
Both the interview and video data revealed a lack of staff engagement and 
interaction if the clients are not displaying overt signs of unhappiness. The 
statement “… if he’s happy we just leave him” (Jane about Ben), exemplifies the 

 
163 
 
staff’s reasoning for their lack of engagement with the clients. However, staff did 
respond to clients when they were perceived as being unhappy.  
 
Four staff spoke of how they respond to perceived client unhappiness, for 
example “Annie gets up and down so whenever she gets up and down we sort 
of talk to her on the way” (Kim about Annie), and “it’s her way of saying she’s 
not happy with something so I’m just rubbing her arm making her feel more 
comfortable” (Carla about Ada while watching a video of their interaction).   
 
Theme 2-Accounting for client disengagement  
Like the construction of client happiness, it is the tacit knowledge developed by 
staff which underpins their rationalisation of their clients’ disengagement. One of 
the recurrent characteristics of this theme was staff’s description of client 
disengagement in terms of relaxing. This is of importance as seven staff spoke 
of disengagement in these terms. Viewing disengagement in this way potentially 
limited clients’ opportunities for engagement. This component is exemplified by 
the statements: “They’ve got all week, they’re doing this, that and the other and 
the weekends they they’re just, they don’t want to do much” (Kim generally 
about the clients), and “… it’s like, a person that works in an office job or 
whatever um, they work nine to five and when they come home they don’t want 
to do anything” (James generally about the clients).   
 
Five staff posited that the clients did not want to engage, again potentially 
limiting their opportunities for engagement. This was exemplified by the 

 
164 
 
statements, “Well they’ve got their own routines that they just like to do 
themselves and you feel like you could step in and help but you don’t. You don’t 
because you know they’re happy doing their thing you know” (Joe generally 
about the clients), and “… unless you invite him down to an activity or go out he 
doesn’t really interact with anyone, like he’s got his room” (Kate about Aaron).   
 
Four staff expressed perceived failure at past attempts to engage clients which 
potentially limited staff’s willingness to attempt to engage the clients now. For 
example, “It’s like, years ago our house manager wanted us to um work, work 
one on one with the clients in the afternoon. But we found that the clients didn’t 
want to do anything. They just played up and had tantrums” (James), and “A lot 
of times he’s just very disinterested, uninterested. Um, when you get him 
involved in stuff he just sort of, just has this snotty look on his face and he puts 
his nose up at you. Um, and gives you this I don’t know, like a no, I’m not 
interested” (Jane about Brett).  
 
And five staff stated that the clients were difficult to interact with for a variety of 
reasons. For example, “… oh Ada’s a really hard one to interact with because 
she doesn’t really show emotions”, (Kate about Ada), and “Um with Brett. 
‘Cause he’s one of the least functional in the house I find it quite difficult to 
interact with him” (Jane about Brett). 
 To a lesser extent, (four) staff rationalised client disengagement using logistical 
issues. For example, “But we’ve got three wheelchairs that need to be pushed 
so it doesn’t work out if we want to go out on the weekends with them” (Jane). 

 
165 
 
Loss of client abilities was also cited as an issue by (three) staff. For example, 
“… um she likes you know just sitting outside, sitting on the swing. She used to 
like trampoline but she doesn’t like that so much the older she gets she’s not as 
like sensory wise like not I don’t know, you can’t really get proper hearing tests 
done on her ‘cause she can’t go to the doctors ‘cause she just lashes out” 
(Christine about Annie).  
 
Theme 3 – Imperatives of the staff role  
The way in which staff constructed their work role appeared to impact on the 
nature of their interactions with their clients. The interview data, to a large 
extent, was consistent with the quantitative data from the first phase of 
the  study, which coded video observations and revealed extremely few 
interactions between staff and residents (M. Prain et al., 2010). 
 
When recounting their most recent shift, all the staff spoke of domestic and 
personal care tasks. Most staff were consistent in their description, talking 
through the routine of tasks. The tasks consisted of varying sequences of 
getting clients out of bed, bathing, dressing, feeding and medicating clients, 
preparing meals, putting clients to bed, house cleaning, book work and 
shopping, depending on the time of day and day of the week of the shift. The 
overwhelming majority of responses from staff to the question “Talk me through 
your most recent shift” (i.e., describe in sequence your shift) fell under the 
categories of personal care and domestic chores. 
 

 
166 
 
All but one staff member spoke of domestic chores and personal care tasks in 
relation to their most recent shift. Typical descriptions within the data were:   
I came in at 7 o’clock, got Brett up, took him to the toilet, showered him, got him 
back to his room and um changed him get him ready for school, day service. 
Um once I got him to breakfast I got Ben, get him up, get him in the shower, 
changed him and he had his breakfast as well then I started cleaning up the 
house vacuuming and um mopping the floors um yeah the other staff usually 
does the girls. Belle, Belinda and um Bonnie [James about his most recent 
shift].  
 
[And] Serve dinner, sort them out, um we have to spoon feed some of the 
clients at [the house] if they can’t feed themselves. Then we shower, yeah we 
shower one of them, change nappies around that time, change nappies on 
about three of them [Joe about his most recent shift].  
 
[And] … it’s up at 6 and you’ve got to get up and everyone up and bathed and 
medicated and fed ready to go out the door at you know certain times [Kim 
about her most recent shift].   
 
From the interview data it is clear that these tasks are considered by staff to be 
the imperative of the role and that social interaction with the clients independent 
of functional tasks is not. The staff’s responses to this question focused on what 
they did and not how they did it, which may suggest a limitation of the question 
asked. Certainly, any human interaction can be viewed as social by its very 
nature and therefore the interactions occurring during personal care and 
domestic chores could be viewed by staff as social. However, the only staff 
member who made comment on the nature of her interactions with clients being 
social or otherwise was Jane. She said, “I would have interacted with all the 
clients but not in a social way”. This is also consistent with the findings of the 
first phase of the study. Further work is required to better understand how staff 
perceive their interactions with clients in light of most of these being around 
functional domestic and personal care tasks.   
 

 
167 
 
Other minor themes which emerged under imperatives of the staff role were:  
activities out of the house (four staff) and adherence to the routine (four 
staff). For example: “But on weekends we take them out like a drive through the 
park” (James generally about the clients), and “… they mainly get their needs 
met through the routine anyway which we all know” (Kate generally about the 
clients). 
 
Discussion 
The second phase of this investigation was designed to build upon and 
triangulate  the data from the first phase of the study, as is common in mixed 
method investigations (Creswell, 2009). The first phase of the study identified 
low levels of engagement in a range of interpersonal and practical activities by 
adults with congenital deafblindness living in community residences (M. Prain et 
al., 2010). This was a matter of concern, as personal relationships and social 
engagement are asserted as important to a person’s quality of life (Felce & 
Perry, 1995; Petry et al., 2005). For people with complex disabilities, support 
staff are often their principal source of interpersonal interaction and mediators of 
engagement. The study saw value in investigating how staff view and interpret 
engagement experienced by the adults they support.   
 
The second phase of the study was designed to gain an understanding of staff 
perspectives. This was seen as an important step towards developing an 
intervention to promote the engagement of adults with congenital deafblindness 
in meaningful interaction that would enhance their health, wellbeing and quality 

 
168 
 
of life. This second phase investigated the perspectives of staff on their 
interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness. It sought to elucidate how 
these perspectives might influence staff behaviours, based on reports from staff 
themselves. It also sought to use staff accounts of their own interactions with 
adults with congenital deafblindness to develop an explanation of the limited 
interactions observed in the previous quantitative phase of the study (see M. 
Prain et al., 2010).    
 
Three central and recurrent themes were generated from the analysis of the 
data from the second phase of the study: construction of client happiness, 
accounting for disengagement, and imperatives of the staff role. Key issues 
relating to these themes are now examined. 
 
Construction of client happiness  
The current data suggest happiness, a private personal state, is ascribed by 
staff to a variety of behaviours exhibited by the adults with congenital 
deafblindness, including smiling, giggling, laughing, and a happy face. Every 
staff member interviewed gave accounts of client behaviours which they had 
interpreted as signalling the clients’ happiness or pleasure. Research by Lyons 
(2005) and Green and Reid (1996) found indices of happiness could be reliably 
evaluated by people familiar with a person with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. Therefore, the associations staff are making between these 
overt expressions within a social context seem reasonable. The frequency and 
context (e.g., time and place) of these occurrences however, requires further 

 
169 
 
investigation. This is because the types of interactions described by the staff 
during the interviews were not seen on the videos and, consequently, not coded 
in the previous study. As mentioned above, only three adults with congenital 
deafblindness were observed in the first phase of the study to have staff 
members interacting with them in a way which was consistent with the code 
conversation. However, during the interviews a number of accounts were given 
by staff of interactions they had with the adults they support which, if observed, 
would have been coded as conversation. For example: “tickling her legs”, 
“making her laugh”, “playing peek-a-boo”. Further investigation is required to 
ascertain potential reasons for this discrepancy between what was observed in 
phase one and what was reported in phase two. Potential reasons for this 
discrepancy are discussed below.      
 
It seems that a two-pronged approach would be useful in further examining 
happiness from the perspective of adults with congenital deafblindness. First, to 
examine what is currently happening during situations in which the adults with 
congenital deafblindness are overtly happy (e.g., smiling, laughing), and looking 
at how these situations can be extended, increased and expanded. Second, to 
engage in discussion with the staff around key aspects of quality of life and how 
they can be translated on an individual basis to the lives of the adults with 
congenital deafblindness with whom they work. This would involve looking at 
activities where the adults with congenital deafblindness express happiness 
overtly. It would also challenge the notion that a lack of distress, unhappiness or 
behaviours of concern indicate that the individual is happy.  

 
170 
 
 
This fundamental disparity in the way the behaviours of adults with 
deafblindness are interpreted by different observers highlights a key issue for 
scientist practitioners in this field. Where I, and indeed Jones et al. (1999) and 
Stancliffe et al. (2007), see disengagement and an issue with quality of life, the 
staff see almost the inverse: happiness. The observations of both groups are 
relative and bound by context. For example, scientist practitioners see the 
clients in the context of what is valuable and possible, as reported by the 
research literature. Staff view the clients in the context of the range of 
behaviours they have observed them to exhibit. These contexts bring each 
group to very different conclusions and interpretations of what they are seeing. 
This major difference in interpretation poses a number of challenges and 
questions for future work in this area. 
 
1. In order to progress the situation for adults with congenital disabilities and 
those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, the perspectives of 
both scientist practitioners and disability support workers need to be 
considered in both research and practice settings, and especially when 
coding or attributing meaning to client behaviours.  
2. Similarly, both the perspectives of scientist practitioners and disability 
support workers should be considered when assessing the quality of life of 
adults with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities.  

 
171 
 
3. When discrepancies between the perspectives of scientist practitioners and 
disability support workers are evident, negotiation is required with a view to 
achieving consensus agreement, ultimately to better the situation for the 
client.  This process could be further enhanced by involving family members 
or others who know the client well, if available.  
 
Accounting for client disengagement  
Staff in the current study gave repeated and multiple accounts for why the 
adults with congenital deafblindness appeared to be largely disengaged. Not 
wanting to engage and relaxing were two of the key explanations given by staff 
for the clients’ disengagement. Potentially it is the passivity of the adults with 
congenital deafblindness which leads the staff to assume they are tired. 
Janssen (2009) and Nyling (2003) state that adults with congenital 
deafblindness tend to be more passive than children with congenital 
deafblindness. This is due to lack of experience in interaction, posing additional 
challenges for their communication partners. 
 
It is possible that adults with congenital deafblindness have not previously 
received consistent positive responses to their attempts to engage with others 
and so have simply given up on social interaction, and developed learned 
helplessness (cf. Seligman, 1975). If this is so, it has important implications for 
developing and prioritising clinical and other support programs. These would 
need to focus on intentional social interaction in an effort to address the 
(re)acquisition of skills and rejuvenate motivation to engage with others. Ehrlich 

 
172 
 
(2007) used the Co-creating Communication developmental framework in her 
study of a man with congenital deafblindness. She found that low functioning 
cues were lost from the man’s communicative repertoire and were not seen 
anymore, probably due to deprivation caused by nonappropriate support in the 
past.   
 
Again, at the heart of this issue is the difference in tacit knowledge and hence 
interpretations of behaviour by the staff, compared to those of scientist 
practitioners. What I and other scientist practitioners view as disengagement, 
the staff view as relaxing or tired. Only one staff member suggested the clients 
might be bored.  
 
Imperatives of the staff role  
Using an analytical framework based on the commonly accepted life domains 
asserted to constitute quality of life (see Felce & Perry, 1995; Petry et al., 2005), 
there is a strong emphasis on physical, material and emotional wellbeing in the 
staff accounts of their role in supporting adults with congenital deafblindness. 
There is however, little or no mention of social wellbeing or personal growth and 
development. Staff play a significant role in mediating the experiences of the 
adults they support. Staff development practices and organisational policy and 
procedures could better emphasise the importance of supporting these adults in 
all life domains. In addition, ongoing evaluation of the impact of changes to staff 
development and policy and procedures should occur.    

 
173 
 
The emphasis staff place on meeting the physical and material needs of the 
adults they support may help to account for the discrepancy between 
interactions observed in phase one of the study and reported in phase two. As 
the staff were being filmed, it is likely they wanted to be seen as doing a good 
job. If social interaction is not considered by the staff to be an imperative of their 
role, they may not feel comfortable demonstrating this type of interactive 
behaviour on film. During the course of my work, disability support workers have 
expressed some discomfort about being observed by the public interacting with 
adults with congenital deafblindness in ways which more effectively engage the 
adult. This is because of the perception of staff that these appear unusual. 
Clearly, further work is needed to better appreciate these issues. They are not 
currently well understood or documented, but they potentially limit opportunities 
for adults with congenital deafblindness to experience the good life. 
  
Additional issues that warrant further investigation  
The contribution of tacit knowledge  
In the initial analysis of the data, the staff’s tacit knowledge about the adults with 
congenital deafblindness emerged strongly as a central and recurrent theme. 
However, it was not included in the key themes. While it largely underpins the 
first two themes-construction of client happiness and accounting for 
disengagement-on its own it added little to help explain the low levels of 
interaction observed in the first phase of the study. Upon reflection about the 
methodological issues and challenges in examining the good life for adults with 
congenital deafblindness, the tacit knowledge of staff about the adults they 
support is potentially a valuable asset in a cooperative research paradigm.  

 
174 
 
During the analysis of the interviews, as coded categories were grouped 
together and compared with other categories, the theme which emerged most 
strongly was tacit knowledge about the adults with congenital deafblindness. 
This was supported by the most coded statements from all staff. Elements of 
this theme emerged from the answers to every question asked of the staff about 
their work and interactions with the clients.   
 
A key component of this theme was knowledge about the likes and dislikes of 
the adults with congenital deafblindness. This is considered important as all 
staff gave unsolicited accounts of client likes and dislikes and how this 
knowledge impacts on how they engage with the adults they support. Examples 
of this component from the data are: “… she kind of likes to be with you and be 
in the kitchen” (Kate about Alison), and “She just likes us tickling and playing 
with her” (Jane about Belle).       
 
Similarly, staff knowledge of the abilities and disabilities of the adults with 
congenital deafblindness was raised by all staff. This knowledge also impacts 
on how staff engage with clients. This component is exemplified by statements 
such as: “… they help you with the routine as well. They … lift their body up or 
whatever” (James about Brett and Ben), and “I took her for a ride and she 
peddles. She’s getting better at peddling. She realised if she wanted to go a bit 
faster she’d need to try more” (Joe about Belinda).    
 

 
175 
 
All staff also gave examples of recognition of clients’ physical and emotional 
states. Given that all the adults with congenital deafblindness in this study are 
primarily nonsymbolic communicators, this component is of key importance for 
staff in knowing how to best respond to their clients. This component is 
exemplified by statements such as: “He’s quite comfortable when he’s outside” 
(Jenny about Brett), and “I hadn’t seen them in ages so Aaron was pretty 
excited” (Christine about Aaron).   
 
Six staff made reference to the personality traits of the adults they support. This 
component highlights the knowledge staff have developed over time about their 
clients’ natures and personalities, and this contributes to how they engage with 
them. It is exemplified in statements such as: “Alison and Annie are really lazy”. 
(Christine about Alison and Annie), and “He’s quite an impatient bloke” (Jane 
about Ben).     
 
This tacit knowledge, developed over time, largely underpins how the staff 
initiate interactions and respond to their clients. A number of authors have 
recognised the important role that tacit knowledge of staff plays in the 
development of high-quality relationships with service users (e.g., H. Reinders, 
2010; Schuengel, Kef, Damen, & Worm, 2010). 
 
Data from the current study highlights the role which tacit knowledge plays in 
how staff respond to and engage with the adults they support. Researchers and 
service organisations need to work to harness the benefits of the potentially 

 
176 
 
large reservoir of tacit knowledge held by support staff. At the same time, it is 
important to develop an understanding of how this knowledge is formed, 
modified and used by staff in day-to-day decision making.  Given the large 
extent to which staff mediate the experiences of adults with congenital 
deafblindness, understanding how the tacit knowledge of staff is shaped is 
necessary when looking to enhance the likelihood of improved quality outcomes 
for the clients. The following chapter suggests ways staff can be involved more 
equally in intervention and research processes. It also discusses how the 
knowledge of disability support workers and scientist practitioners can be 
declared and negotiated to benefit each other, as well as the adults with 
congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities with 
whom they work. 
 
Mismatch in communication modes 
There was insufficient data to include mismatch in communication modes as a 
key theme in the study. Nevertheless, there did appear to be some consistent 
issues across the interviews and observations which contribute to an increased 
understanding of the situation, and warrant further investigation. Given the 
study’s focus was on interaction, there is intrinsic value in examining staff 
perspectives on communication.  
 
There appears to be a distinct mismatch between staff reports about how the 
adults with congenital deafblindness express themselves and how the staff 
express themselves to the adults with congenital deafblindness. In particular, 
the clients are reported to express themselves using informal vocalisations and 

 
177 
 
the staff report using speech. For example, when talking about Annie, Kim said, 
“And you can talk to Annie and go right up to her and say you or you’re beautiful 
Annie and she’ll go ooohhh”, and “I’d talk to her and as she’d get going she’d 
start vocalising sort of, sometimes she sort of sings” (Joe about Belinda).  
 
Similarly, the clients are reported to use body language and facial expression 
and the staff use signs. This is illustrated by statements such as: “With Belle I 
usually sign food or toilet and she’s pretty good she usually goes” (Jenny about 
Belle), and “… if you sign toilet she goes straight to the toilet so if you sign to 
her she understands signs like dinner and toilet and bus” (James about Belle), 
and “Yeah if you sign man, she’ll go Yeah” (Kim about Alison). There is no 
mention of any of the adults with congenital deafblindness using signs to 
express themselves throughout the interviews.  
 
There is nothing inherently wrong with communication partners using different 
modes of communication. Given what is now understood from the literature on 
infant communication development and the importance of reciprocity and 
intersubjectivity, as discussed in chapter two, it is likely that the mismatch in 
communication modes in these instances is reducing opportunities for high-
quality interactions. 
The staff also raise issues about the challenges of communicating with the 
adults with congenital deafblindness. For example, statements such as, “… 
there’s no communication in that house at all, well there is but there’s no direct 
communication with the clients” (Joe), and “… because they can’t talk and 

 
178 
 
you've got to kind of watch their body actions and their noises” (Christine), and 
“they’re really difficult clients because they don’t communicate properly” (Kate). 
Throughout the interviews staff repeatedly reported understanding and 
responding to a wide range of communicative behaviours of the adults they 
support. But they appeared to struggle to articulate the ways the clients do 
communicate and express themselves. From my experience this appears to be 
a double-edged sword: the staff find it difficult to label and acknowledge as 
valid, the communicative behaviours of the adults they support.  
 
For these reasons interventions such as Video Interaction Guidance and Marte 
Meo, discussed in chapter three, have potential to bring into focus, and 
generate language for, what is occurring, and address mismatches in 
communication modes. Both these interventions have an emphasis on labelling 
and reflecting upon behaviours underpinned by tacit knowledge. However, 
these interventions are relatively new and much more research is required to 
investigate their efficacy in a range of settings, including residential settings for 
adults with congenital deafblindness.   
 
Issues around methodology  
The second phase of the study used a qualitative approach. This generated 
data which have provided a greater understanding of how staff perceive their 
role. It also enabled insights about the interaction (or lack of interaction) 
between adults with congenital deafblindness and their support staff than was 
available from the quantitative analysis alone. However, there were 

 
179 
 
discrepancies between the two phases of the study. The first phase indicated 
limited social interactions (M. Prain et al., 2010). In the second phase, staff 
described social interaction occurring during personal care and other activities 
not captured during the observation sessions in phase one. This suggests a 
major limitation to the first phase of the study. In the first phase, observations of 
personal care activities were not conducted for ethical reasons. However, it 
could be that had such observations been conducted, quite different 
conclusions might have been made with respect to the form and frequency of 
social interaction between adults with congenital deafblindness and the staff 
who support them. Furthermore, these same findings raise questions as to why 
social interaction might only take place in the context of the privacy of personal 
care, and not at other times in people’s lives. Given the staff in the current study 
indicated that they did not consider social interaction with their clients as an 
imperative of their role, it is possible they interacted with their clients less than 
usual while being filmed. This is because they wanted to be seen as carrying 
out what they perceived to be the functional imperatives of their role. This also 
requires further investigation.  
 
While the first phase alone clearly did not adequately capture the full nature of 
what occurs between staff and adults with congenital deafblindness, neither did 
the second phase alone. This highlights the value and contribution that a mixed 
method approach can make. Staff spoke of social interactions which if observed 
would have been coded as conversation. But it is difficult from the interviews to 

 
180 
 
know how frequently these type of interactions occur and for how long, which a 
quantitative approach can offer. 
 
Limitations 
No single, generalisable theory was generated from this phase of the study. 
While the method outlined by Charmaz (2006) was used to guide the analytic 
process, theoretical sampling was not undertaken, making the process more 
consistent with thematic analysis (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). Although no 
single substantive theory was generated, the analytic process elucidated some 
conceptual, philosophical and practical issues, which impact on interactions 
between adults with congenital deafblindness and the staff who support them. 
  
In addition, member checking only occurred at the end of the data collection 
phase of the research. That is, participants were given an opportunity to 
comment on the transcripts of their interviews. A future study could extend the 
current investigation to include an opportunity for participants to comment on 
the themes induced from their data. Indeed, the following chapter examines 
more closely the philosophical and methodological issues associated with 
researching adults with congenital deafblindness. It is argued that rather than 
simply member checking the final outcome of the data analysis, staff need to be 
much more actively involved in the research process. Issues relating to staff 
involvement and engagement, and the potential benefits of employing an action 
research methodology in the current context, are also explored.  

 
181 
 
Evaluating the quality of phase two of the study  
This chapter concludes with an examination of the quality of the work presented 
in light of the preceding chapters. This study employed qualitative research 
methods in a field which predominantly employs quantitative research methods. 
As a result there is a need to highlight and elaborate on the quality of the 
qualitative work undertaken in this study. In addition, Tracy (2010) argues the 
need to demonstrate quality of qualitative research given the methodological 
conservatism evident in government and funding agencies. For example, the 
National Health and Medical Research Council has a preference for quantitative 
research (see National Health and Medical Research Council, 1998, 2009). 
 
Tracy (2010) presents a model for ascertaining quality in qualitative research 
and proposes eight big tent criteria for excellent qualitative research. The 
following addresses each of these criteria and documents how these criteria 
have been addressed. 
 
1. Worthy topic  
This criterion, addressed more fully in the first three chapters, is clearly 
addressed by this study. There is inherent interest in the topic. It has received 
little direct attention from researchers, although a number have identified the 
need for further studies (e.g., Maes et al., 2007; Parker et al., 2007). As stated 
earlier, though the population of adults with congenital deafblindness is small, 
findings in this area are applicable more broadly to others with complex 

 
182 
 
communication needs, such as those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities, autism, acquired brain injury and dementia.  
 
2. Rich rigour  
The rigour of this study is addressed in the methods section of this chapter 
which specifically discusses criteria for rigour in qualitative research or 
naturalistic inquiry as presented by Lincoln and Guba (1985). 
 
3. Sincerity 
While any researcher will bring subjective values and biases to their subject of 
investigation, there is a need to document these explicitly when undertaking 
qualitative research given the researcher is the research instrument. Key points 
in this thesis demonstrate reflexivity, acknowledgement of biases, and 
transparency about methods and challenges. These are found in chapter four, 
where my perspectives as a researcher are declared, and in the current chapter 
when acknowledging the limitations of this study.  
 
4.  Credibility  
The term credibility is commonly used to refer to the reliability and replicability of 
quantitative studies. It is achieved through different processes when applied to 
qualitative 
research, 
such 
as 
thick 
description, 
triangulation 
and/or 
crystallisation, multivocality and partiality (Tracy, 2010). The following 
demonstrates how each of these has been achieved in the current study.  

 
183 
 
The researcher's tacit knowledge of the culture in which they are researching is 
of high importance. Good qualitative research examines what is occurring below 
the surface and explores that which is assumed, implicit and has become 
common sense to the research participants (Tracy, 2010). This is one of the 
greatest strengths of the current study. My prolonged exposure to the research 
setting and culture enabled a deeper understanding of the meanings behind the 
language used during the interviews. It also gave me knowledge of what was 
not mentioned or elaborated on by the staff. My tacit knowledge of the setting 
also enabled me to provide the thick descriptions, using the language of the 
staff, necessary for credibility.  
 
The second phase of the study triangulates the quantitative data from the first 
observational phase, as it highlights a lack of emphasis on social interaction 
between staff and adults with congenital deafblindness. It perhaps therefore 
offers an even greater contribution to current knowledge by crystallising the 
topic. Crystallisation involves utilising multiple methods, researchers, and 
theoretical frameworks to open up a more complex and in depth understanding 
of the topic while remaining partial.  
 
Multivocality is achieved in the current study by presenting the viewpoints of the 
staff, which both support and diverge from the viewpoints of myself and other 
scientist practitioners. Indeed, it is this multivocality within the current study 
which highlights the need for alternative intervention and research methods in 
this field. These are discussed in further detail in the following chapter.  

 
184 
 
5. Resonance 
Tracy (2010) presents two key practices which achieve resonance: aesthetic 
merit and transferability. She argues a good quality qualitative report will employ 
at least one of these practices, but that they often go hand in hand. My report of 
the data analysis is somewhat lacking in aesthetic merit largely due to the 
discrepancy between my own perspective and that of the staff. This is 
discussed at length in the next chapter. However, resonance is achieved 
through the applicability of the findings from this phase of the research to other 
populations and settings. These include dementia patients in nursing homes 
and adults who communicate nonsymbolically in any residential setting. While 
qualitative research cannot claim generalisability in a statistical sense, its 
findings can still be useful with other populations and in other circumstances 
and settings.  
 
6. Significant contribution  
The current study makes a theoretical contribution to the field. Its findings 
highlight that to achieve sustainable, improved, quality interactions between 
staff and adults with congenital deafbindness, closer attention must be paid to 
the relationships and interactions between scientist practitioners and the staff 
working with the adults with congenital deafblindness. These relationships and 
interactions have received little attention from researchers but are paramount to 
achieving positive results for adults with congenital deafblindness. This issue is 
discussed further in the next chapter. 

 
185 
 
This in turn gives the current study heuristic significance as it demands further 
investigation into the efficacy of more collaborative research and intervention 
processes. It also overlaps into the realm of policy by highlighting the need to 
make explicit the role of staff in providing sustained opportunities for social 
engagement with adults with congenital deafblindness. In addition, the current 
study is practically and methodologically significant. It presents alternative 
approaches to both intervention and research as a result of its findings. 
 
7. Ethical  
This study was approved by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology 
University Human Research Ethics Committee, which largely addresses 
procedural ethics. Nevertheless, Tracy (2010) notes the importance of 
addressing a number of additional ethical considerations, namely: situational, 
cultural, relational and exiting ethics.   
 
“A situational ethic assumes that each circumstance is different and that 
researchers must repeatedly reflect on, critique and question their ethical 
decisions” (Tracy, 2010, p. 847). These situational ethical considerations arise 
repeatedly throughout a research project and need to be reflected upon and 
evaluated on an ongoing basis. Some of the types of situational ethical 
considerations which arose during phase two of the study were: whether to 
interview staff during or outside their paid work hours (this was negotiated with 
each participant), whether to go ahead with filming when staff had not received 
the message that filming would be occurring (this was also negotiated each 

 
186 
 
time), and what to do when a resident of the house not participating in the 
research walked into the line of the video camera (consent was sought for this 
resident to be filmed).  
 
It is impractical to list every situational ethical consideration which arises during 
a research project, but it is important to recognise the researcher has been 
mindful of these issues. In this instance, for the most part these issues were 
addressed through supervision and negotiation with the research participants as 
the need arose.  
 
In considering relational ethics, I would assert there was no fundamental breach 
of trust or ethical misconduct. However, on reflection, a significant limitation of 
the research process was the asymmetry in the relationship between myself as 
researcher/interviewer and the research participants/interviewees. I discuss and 
elaborate on the importance of reciprocity and collaboration for both intervention 
and research purposes in the following chapter. It is important to note here 
though, that while the processes I followed are well documented research 
protocols, I experienced a level of discomfort because of the inherent 
asymmetry in an interview format.  
 
Exiting ethics, or those beyond the data collection phase, have been largely 
addressed through the publication of the article “Interacting with adults with 
congenital deafblindness – the experiences of disability support workers” (M. 
Prain et al., 2012b). The article enabled the perspectives of staff, which are 

 
187 
 
largely absent from the literature, to be presented. The following chapter also 
addresses future directions for research which have been informed and shaped 
by this study.  
 
8. Meaningful coherence  
Elements relevant to this final criterion are: the use of methods and procedures 
which fit the stated research objective and achieve these objectives, and 
meaningfully 
interconnect 
literature, 
research 
questions, 
findings 
and 
interpretations. The second and third chapters highlight the need for qualitative 
investigations into the perspectives of disability support workers on their 
interactions with the adults they support. The findings not only achieve the goal 
of gaining greater insight into staff perspectives, but demonstrate the value of 
using qualitative methods to generate such insights. Literature is drawn upon 
throughout the discussion section of this chapter to support assertions made in 
light of the findings of the study.   
 
The following chapter summarises the findings from the two phases of the study 
and examines these in relation to the existing literature and overarching aims of 
the study. Key issues and questions raised by the study are discussed and the 
chapter concludes with recommendations for future work from philosophical, 
theoretical and practical perspectives.

Chapter Seven: Discussion  
 
This thesis builds on the existing body of research literature about people with 
congenital deafblindness and offers new insights and recommendations for 
further work in the field. It explores the application of a mixed method design 
and is informed by work concerning adults with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. This chapter examines key findings from the study as a 
whole in light of existing literature and theory. Based on these findings the 
chapter discusses the need for alternative methodologies for research and 
interventions aimed at examining and promoting further opportunities for adults 
with congenital deafblindness to experience the good life.  
 
The organising concept which links and elucidates the findings of each phase of 
the study is the perspectival dissonance between disability support workers and 
what is proposed by existing research conducted by scientist practitioners. 
Dissonance—meaning a lack of agreement, consistency or harmony—is 
documented repeatedly in the research literature on interactions with people 
with congenital deafblindness (e.g., Hart, 2010; Janssen, Riksen-Walraven, & 
van Dijk, 2002; M. Prain et al., 2010; Romer & Schoenberg, 1991; Vervloed et 
al., 2006). However, it is rarely discussed with regard to the relationships and 
interactions between scientist practitioners and disability support workers. The 
study of Wareing and Newell (2005) is one of the few which considers the 
relationships between scientist practitioners, disability support workers and 
clients. Their analysis of a discussion between a scientist practitioner and a 
team of disability support workers about a client reveals the connectedness of 

 
189 
 
staff and clients as opposed to being separate and discrete entities. 
“Understanding the device ‘Worker/Client’ as tied has significant implications 
not just for how we support people constituted as having an intellectual 
disability, but also for understanding the largely unexplored relationship 
between all of us who provide support and our silent partner – the client” 
(Wareing & Newell, 2005, p. 113). This chapter discusses some potential ways 
to further examine these relationships with a view to sustainable approaches to 
staff and client development.  
 
Revisiting the good life 
This thesis has examined the good life, as posited by Reinders (2002), and 
elucidated some key issues and factors which require consideration with regard 
to its measurement and evaluation. Reinders (2002) refers to the good life as 
civic friendship, or positive interactive experiences beyond being a client of a 
service for people with disabilities. This is not possible for most adults with 
congenital deafblindness without the mediation of staff. The current study 
identified limited opportunities for the adults with congenital deafblindness to 
experience the good life within the disability specific services they receive. 
Considerably more work is required within these services before staff can better 
facilitate and mediate interactions between their clients and the communities in 
which they live. This again highlights the need for intervention at the disability 
service level. Disability support workers need to be able to create opportunities 
for adults with congenital deafblindness to experience social togetherness, or 
the good life, initially with disability support workers themselves. Once these 

 
190 
 
workers better understand how this is achieved, they may be able to facilitate 
the good life with others less familiar with their clients.       
 
As stated at the outset, this thesis is essentially an examination of three 
relationships which contribute to an understanding of the good life, and to 
creating opportunities for experiencing the good life. These three relationships 
are: those between scientist practitioners and people with congenital 
deafblindness, those between disability support workers and people with 
congenital deafblindness, and those between scientist practitioners and 
disability support workers. The same principles scientist practitioners apply to 
improve relationships and interactions between people with congenital 
deafblindness and their communication partners can be applied to the 
relationships and interactions between these communication partners and 
scientist practitioners.  
 
Hart (2010) argues that “if language is to be an outcome for partnerships 
involving congenitally deafblind people, equal contributions must be made by 
both partners, deafblind and nondeafblind”  (Hart, 2010, p. 23). I would apply 
this same principle a little more broadly. It is relevant to opportunities to 
experience the good life as an outcome without necessarily aiming for 
language. It is also relevant to the partnerships between scientist practitioners 
and the primary interaction partners of people with congenital deafblindness. 
That is, the interaction partners of people with congenital deafblindness need to 
make equal contributions to the formulation of intervention and research goals 

 
191 
 
and processes if they are to fully engage with, and participate in, these 
processes. Scientist practitioners need to ensure these are negotiated. Issues 
raised by the communication partners of people with congenital deafblindness 
need to be acknowledged and accounted for within the process of negotiating 
clinical and research goals.  
 
The acknowledgement of the perspectival dissonance between scientist 
practitioners and disability support workers is a key contribution of this 
investigation into what is currently understood about interactions with people 
with congenital deafblindness. This study also provides insights into issues 
which must be addressed for intervention approaches to be effective and 
sustainable. The next section provides a summary of the study’s key findings 
and issues which require further investigation and consideration.  
 
Summary of key findings 
Phase one of the study aimed to examine the current topography, frequency 
and duration of interactions between adults with congenital deafblindness and 
the staff who support them. It also investigated the utility and reliability of a 
coding tool previously used with adults with severe intellectual disabilities with 
whom adults with congenital deafblindness share services. The first phase of 
the study revealed extremely low levels of interaction between the staff and 
adults with congenital deafblindness (less than two percent of the observed 
time). It also revealed high levels of disengagement of the adults with congenital 
deafblindness and a preponderance of assisting and supporting behaviours by 

 
192 
 
the staff; extremely limited social or conversational behaviour was observed. 
The interrater reliability of the coding tool with this different population was 
found to be variable. A number of issues with regard to observational studies 
and the interrater reliability of observational studies were raised. Seven 
recommendations were made based on the findings of phase one of the study.  
 
1.  That interrater reliability be calculated using both percentage agreement 
and kappa, then, if there is large variation between the two, calculate 
percentage agreement using only occurrences. 
2.  That for sequential observational studies, percentage agreement be 
calculated using number of occurrences of each behaviour overall, 
regardless of the time interval they occur at, as a reasonable means to 
allow for slight human variation which potentially lowers the significance of 
the findings. 
3.  That caution is exercised when using samples from data sets. 
4.  That changes be made to the coding tool used if employed with people with 
congenital deafblindness.  
5.  Consider using a consensus coding approach.  
6.  Consider filming for longer periods at different times of the day.  
7. The implementation of an intervention such as the Hanging Out 
Program (Forster, 2008) should be considered to increase time staff spend 
interacting with clients. 
See chapter five for a more detailed presentation of these recommendations.  

 
193 
 
These recommendations centre around ways to improve phase one of the study 
if it were to be conducted again. Phase one also raised some questions which 
are not well addressed in the literature. The rationale for phase two of the study 
emerged from reflection upon both the literature and the findings from phase 
one of the study. 
 
Phase two, like phase one, was exploratory in nature and also aimed to gain 
insight into what is currently occurring for adults with congenital deafblindness 
in their interactions with staff. However, phase two was conducted from the 
perspective of the staff, ultimately to better understand how best to 
operationalise and evaluate the good life for adults with congenital 
deafblindness. Interviews were conducted with disability support workers to 
generate qualitative data in order to gain an understanding of the perspectives 
of those who spend the most time with adults with congenital deafblindness. 
The interview data were analysed in light of the very low levels of interaction 
observed in the first phase of the study. The analysis both triangulated the data 
from the first phase and provided insights into potential explanations for the low 
levels of interaction observed. The analysis of the interviews also highlighted 
the differences between the perspectives of staff relative to those of scientist 
practitioners, as evidenced in the literature. A number of issues and questions 
arose from the analysis of the interview data in phase two.  
 
 1.  It is scientist practitioners who code behaviours in intervention studies, but 
should the opinions of those who know the clients better, namely the 

 
194 
 
disability support workers who mediate the support of adults with congenital 
deafblindness, be given more creed? 
2.  It is people who know the clients well who complete proxy quality of life 
questionnaires, but should the observations of researchers be given more 
creed? 
3.  How are these discrepancies between the worldviews of scientist 
practitioners and disability support workers reconciled with the best 
outcome for adults with congenital deafblindness?  
 
The two phases of this study present data in different forms and collected 
through different methods. However, when integrated, these data indicate that 
the adults with congenital deafblindness who participated in the study 
experienced extremely low levels of interaction outside of personal care and 
domestic tasks. Given the perspectives of the staff who mediate their support, 
there were very limited opportunities for these adults to experience the good 
life.  
 
The remainder of this chapter examines this issue from various philosophical 
and theoretical perspectives to determine the most beneficial paradigm with 
which to progress the current situation for scientist practitioners, disability 
support workers and most importantly adults with congenital deafblindness.  
Information presented in the earlier chapters of this thesis will be drawn upon to 
substantiate the claims made.  

 
195 
 
Directions for future research and practice 
The need for multiple perspectives   
This study has highlighted the need for pluralism when determining methods to 
investigate interactions with people who are unable to self-report, in this 
instance, adults with congenital deafblindness. The mixed method approach 
that was used both triangulated and crystallised (see Tracy, 2010) data, but 
also revealed inconsistencies in the findings, depending on the method used. 
For example, the observational coding tool devised by Jones et al. (1999) and 
used in the first phase of the study revealed that the adults with congenital 
deafblindness were for the most part disengaged. The interviews used in the 
second phase of the study revealed clients to be happy and relaxed, but also 
confirmed that they experience very limited opportunities for social interaction. 
  
If multiple methods are not employed, it is recommended that the nature of 
participants vary to optimise the opportunity for multiple perspectives on the 
situation being researched. For example, Neander and Skott (2008) interviewed 
both parents and therapists about their experiences of early intervention 
processes. This yielded considerably different perspectives from the two 
participant groups, opening up the possibility for a broader, deeper 
understanding of the situation. While the present study employed different 
methods, it is likely that the difference in perspectives identified would have 
been revealed had interviews also been carried out with multiple categories of 
staff (e.g., interviewing both direct support staff and allied health clinicians), had 
they been available. 

 
196 
 
There is considerable value in seeking multiple perspectives on a situation. In 
analysing the interview data, I was frequently challenged by reading how staff 
interpreted the behaviours of the adults they support relative to the way I, as a 
scientist practitioner, would have interpreted them. Interpretations of observers 
are necessarily underpinned by the observers’ tacit knowledge, which shapes 
their ontological beliefs and epistemological framework. That is, researchers will 
only see something which they believe exists and will select methods for 
documenting and measuring its existence accordingly. For example, a disability 
support worker may see an adult with deafblindness who urinates while clothed 
as carrying out an act of spite as it means the support worker will have to 
change them. A scientist practitioner on the other hand may view this same act 
as one of sensory stimulation to alleviate boredom or create a pleasurable 
experience. These two people’s ontological beliefs, their beliefs about what 
exists in this instance, are quite different. One is grounded in day-to-day, case-
by-case, experiential practice; the other is grounded in a theoretical framework 
for explaining motivations of behaviours of concern. (Note: the term behaviours 
of concern is used in Victoria, Australia, rather than challenging behaviour, to 
shift the focus of how these behaviours are perceived and understood.)  
 
Nevertheless, in other instances staff clearly recognise idiosyncratic indications 
of pleasure or displeasure in context, which a scientist practitioner unfamiliar 
with the person with deafblindness may misinterpret. Both disability support 
workers and scientist practitioners, while having different epistemological 
frameworks, have valuable information to bring to an open discussion on 

 
197 
 
interpretation of behaviours of individuals with congenital deafblindness or 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. For this reason, any intervention 
or research methodology which aims to address quality of interactions or quality 
of life for people with congenital deafblindness, should necessarily involve the 
perspectives of their primary communication partners. Given that these will 
often differ substantially, it is necessary to continue negotiations about 
meanings and goals until each perspective has been adequately considered 
and accounted for.  
 
The need to address power imbalances in research and intervention  
This study has highlighted the difference in perspectives between scientist 
practitioners, as represented in both the literature and my own perspective, and 
disability support workers. In examining the best way forward for research and 
intervention with people with congenital deafblindness it is apparent that there is 
not only a difference in perspectives, but a difference in power. There is a need 
to address the current power imbalances in research and intervention in this 
field. This is discussed further below. A number of research and practice 
methodologies are also suggested. These can be utilised to ensure issues 
around power are taken into consideration and ameliorated as much as 
possible. 
 
The need to address the power imbalance between scientist practitioners and 
disability support workers can be argued as a moral imperative. It is also a 
means to ensure more sustainable outcomes in research aiming to achieve 

 
198 
 
better outcomes for people with disabilities. Researchers investigating 
interactions with people with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities have an implicit motivation to enhance and improve the 
circumstances for these groups. This means there is a need to reflect upon the 
nature of power within the research process.  
 
Kamler and Thomson (2006) note the importance of reflexivity as a researcher. 
They argue that reflexivity involves examining how we may perpetuate power 
relationships and advancing particular ways of labelling and discussing people, 
experiences and events. As discussed in chapter three, the perspectives of 
disability support workers are largely lacking from the research in which they 
are involved. Rather, it is researchers who report on interventions involving staff 
and make recommendations to train staff so that the staff see the situation more 
from the researchers’ perspective. The researchers do not appear to value, 
examine or incorporate the perspectives of staff in the research or intervention 
processes. However, “the moral principle of respect for persons is most fully 
honoured when power is shared not only in the application of knowledge about 
persons, but also in the generation of such knowledge” (Heron, 1981, p. 35). 
 
Miller and Crabtree (2000) state “clinical researchers share ownership of the 
research with clinical participants, thus undermining the patriarchal bias of the 
dominant paradigm and opening its assumptions to investigation” (Miller & 
Crabtree, 2000, p. 616). This is certainly an ideal of clinical research. However, 
most research examining the efficacy of different intervention models with 

 
199 
 
adults with congenital deafblindness and for people with profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities fails to involve disability support workers as equals in 
the research process. This potentially limits the long-term efficacy of the 
intervention due to lack of ownership and intentionality on the part of the staff. It 
also runs counter to Heron’s (1981) argument that researching people requires 
a commitment to providing conditions under which research participants can 
develop skills in independent inquiry into the human condition.  
 
Increasingly, people with disabilities and their families are becoming more 
equitably involved in informing and shaping the services they receive and the 
research in which they are involved (e.g., Gilbert, 2004; McLaughlin, 2010; 
Ramcharan, Grant, & Flynn, 2004; Walmsley & Johnson, 2003).  Verdugo et al. 
(2005) note the increasing involvement of people with intellectual disabilities 
and their families in the design and implementation of research around quality 
of life measurement and evaluation. However, for those who cannot self-report 
and have little contact with family, it is the staff who mediate their support who 
will need to be involved in these research and practice activities. In any event, 
regardless of whether the adult with a disability is able to self-report or not, the 
perspective of their primary communication partners, usually staff, is of 
importance in understanding and shaping the situation. 
 
When exploring power imbalances there is value in examining Lukes’ (2005) 
three-dimensional model of power in which he stresses the importance of the 
concept of latent conflict (Lorenzi, 2006). Lukes argues that the conflict is latent 

 
200 
 
because those subject to power (i.e., adults with congenital deafblindness in 
their relationships with disability support workers and disability support workers 
in their relationships with scientist practitioners) do not express, or are unaware 
of, their own interests. Lukes asserts that those in power can exercise power 
over those subject to their power by influencing and shaping their wants and 
preferences. He also states that power can be exercised by preventing 
grievances in order to ensure the status quo. Lukes argues it is important to 
investigate this third dimension of power-the power to prevent the formation of 
grievances. “In order to gather evidence to support the claim that an apparent 
case of consensus is not genuine, but imposed, one must investigate inaction, 
consider structural and institutional power, and consider ways in which 
demands are prevented from being raised” (Lorenzi, 2006, p. 93). These ideas 
are consistent with Wareing and Newell’s (2002) notion of a choice between no 
choice inherent in the power imbalances evident in the disability sector. In 
addition, these ideas are useful to consider when looking at how the staff 
construct client happiness and account for their disengagement. They are also 
useful when contemplating the relationship between disability support workers 
and scientist practitioners. I will return to these ideas when looking at theory and 
practice in enhancing opportunities for adults with congenital deafblindness to 
experience the good life.  
 
This study has highlighted the need for different research processes in order to 
achieve different research outcomes. We need to change the way we undertake 
research processes in order to do justice to the complexities inherent in the 

 
201 
 
individuals and interactions involved in the research process (Reason & Rowan, 
1981). This is also necessary to achieve more long-term sustainable outcomes.  
 
Most research into interaction with people with congenital deafblindness, and 
those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, is of a clinical nature 
and many of the researchers involved in these fields are current or former 
practising clinicians. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the power 
imbalances evident in the research are equally present in clinical settings. For 
example, Neander and Skott’s (2008) study of therapeutic processes in early 
intervention revealed marked perceived power imbalances from those receiving 
services. This however, requires further investigation in relation to services for 
adults with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. 
 
There is also value in considering the language used in both clinical and 
research settings to maximise collaboration. In particular, how roles and titles 
are named. At the outset of this thesis I argued a case for using the term 
scientist practitioner to encapsulate the valuing of both science training and 
practice training of clinicians and clinical researchers. However, this term seems 
particularly alienating in the context of examining the quality of life of adults with 
congenital deafblindness or profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Given 
the above argument for the need for more mutual, reciprocal, collaborative 
practice, I suggest scientist practitioners carefully consider the title they give 
themselves when working in the disability sector. The aim should be to minimise 

 
202 
 
alienation and foster collaboration with families, staff and people with 
disabilities. Disability support workers are best placed to collaborate with 
scientist practitioners in improving the quality of life of adults with congenital 
deafblindness. I suggest scientist practitioners-working as researchers, 
clinicians or clinical researchers-name themselves disability resource workers. It 
denotes both the similarities, namely that both are working within the disability 
sector, as well as the differences, namely that support workers provide direct 
support while resource workers provide structures and strategies to enable this 
support. Regardless of the terminology used, it is imperative that at the outset of 
collaboration, roles and responsibilities within the relationship are made explicit 
and negotiated if necessary. It is reasonable to expect that disability support 
workers will engage with, and reflect upon, the processes if these are 
negotiated at the outset. Disability resource workers will bring information from 
the scientific literature and both groups will bring information from their 
workplace observations.  
 
There are a number of philosophies, methodologies and constructs which 
appear more compatible with the needs articulated above. They show promise 
for progressing the situation for adults with congenital deafblindness and 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Key concepts and principles 
inherent in good quality interactions, as presented by Rodbroe and Janssen 
(2006b), provide a useful framework for ensuring multiple perspectives are 
considered and that power is distributed more equitably. In particular, the 
concept of reciprocity appears to be a necessary element in fostering 

 
203 
 
harmonious relationships between scientist practitioners and disability support 
workers. Edwards’ (2007, 2009) construct of relational agency also provides a 
useful backdrop to using an action research methodology and an integral theory 
approach to research and intervention that is more likely to effect positive long-
term sustainable outcomes. These ideas are discussed further below. 
 
An additional challenge in researching interactions with people with congenital 
deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities is 
that there are necessarily two others with different roles, experiences and 
perspectives: the person with deafblindness and their interaction partner. Most 
research to date has focused on the interactions and relationships between the 
person with a disability and their communication partner. It has not addressed 
the interactions and relationships between the communication partner and the 
scientist practitioner.  
 
Reciprocity  
I assert that scientist practitioners need to practice what we preach in the field 
of congenital deafblindness: symmetrical, reciprocal, attuned co-created 
interactions with participants in our research and those involved in therapy with 
us. It is practice based on these principles of interaction that will create the 
conditions for new insights, learning and empowerment.   
 
Reciprocity is a key concept to emerge from research into human 
communication development and a key principle in models of intervention with 
people with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple 

 
204 
 
disabilities (Chen et al., 2007; Rodbroe & Janssen, 2006b). Indeed, Daelman, 
Nafstad and Rodbroe (1993) assert that one of the greatest risks for a person 
with congenital deafblindness is a lack of reciprocity between themself and their 
environment. However, we need to apply this concept beyond interactions 
between clients and their communication partners, to our own interaction with 
the communication partners of our clients and the participants in our research.  
 
Increasingly, scientist practitioners are recognising the importance of reciprocity 
in relationships in both clinical and research practices. A major theme 
generated by Neander and Skott (2008) in their study about parents’ and 
therapists’ experiences of early intervention was striving towards reciprocal 
responsiveness. Both parents and therapists remarked upon the fact that “those 
qualities that are important in normal relationships are just as important in the 
therapeutic relationship” (Neander & Skott, 2008, p. 300). Along these lines, 
Pound (2011) argues the need for more reciprocal, two-way relationships 
between healthcare professionals, including support workers, and people with 
communication disabilities. She states, “dominant cultural narratives of disability 
and rehabilitation tend to emphasise a unilateral perspective on need, 
dependency, and giving” (Pound, 2011, p. 197). Just as these narratives and 
cultures appear to persist in interactions and relationships between adults with 
congenital deafblindness and support staff, so too the dominant positivist 
research paradigm perpetuates this “unilateral perspective on need” of research 
participants. However, employing the social model of disability helps redress 
this imbalance and increases opportunities for more reciprocal interactions and 

 
205 
 
relationships. “Social capital retains a focus on social connectedness and 
revisits the economic metaphor of the capital to be gained from investing in 
social ties and social networks” (Pound, 2011, p. 205). 
 
Pound (2011) argues that paying attention to the social model of disability 
allows us to : 
- 
create opportunities and conditions for people to develop as active 
citizens  
- 
value explicitly human resources such as experience, knowhow, passion 
and compassion  
- 
reconstrue service recipients as colleagues, providers and role models 
- 
harness the resources they bring to therapeutic endeavours and civic 
wellbeing. 
 
This in no way devalues the expertise of clinicians and researchers. Although 
Pound (2011) is talking about relationships between service providers and 
people with disabilities, the same holds true for relationships between scientist 
practitioners and agents of intervention, namely the communication partners of 
adults with congenital deafblindness. Indeed, her first point-“create opportunities 
and conditions for people to develop as active citizens”-can only be achieved if 
we apply the remaining principles to our relationships with the interaction 
partners of adults with nonsymbolic communication.  
 

 
206 
 
While Pound (2011) argues the need for reciprocity within therapeutic 
relationships, the need exists equally within the context of research. Petersen 
(2011) also argues for the need for reciprocity within the process of research 
with human participants. She claims that if we cannot say we have risked 
ourselves throughout the research process, potentially by declaring our 
intentions, beliefs and biases to the research participants, we cannot say it is 
reciprocal.  
 
Tregaskis (2004) suggests a number of key principles that are useful to 
consider when examining how to progress the current situation for scientist 
practitioners, 
disability 
support 
workers 
and 
adults 
with 
congenital 
deafblindness.  Using the social model of disability, she offers from her personal 
experience, “strategies to engage in dialogue through difference” which, while 
not explicitly stated, are clearly underpinned by valuing mutual and reciprocal 
interactions and relationships. The strategies she proposes are: developing a 
shared agenda for change; acknowledging and understanding the pressures 
faced by the other party; and sharing skills and knowledge to speed up 
achieving change. These strategies are consistent with Edwards’ (2007, 2009) 
notion of relational agency .  
 
Relational agency  
Edwards’ concept of relational agency “is intended to capture a capacity to align 
one’s thoughts and actions with those of others to interpret aspects of one’s 
world and to act on and respond to those interpretations” (Edwards, 2007, p. 4). 
It also aims to “strengthen purposeful responses to complex problems” 

 
207 
 
(Edwards, 2009, p. 39). One of the key findings of this study is the perspectival 
dissonance between scientist practitioners and disability support workers. The 
concept of relational agency is therefore useful to address this mismatch of 
worldviews and ultimately progress the situation for adults with congenital 
deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
 
Edwards (2011) poses an argument which highlights one of the limitations in 
research with people with congenital deafblindness to date. She states 
“relational engagement with the knowledge and motives of others can produce 
a form of common knowledge which comprises a partially shared understanding 
of what matters for other contributing experts. This knowledge can then mediate 
responsive professional action”. Edwards (2011) also states that aiming for 
responsive professional action without engaging with the knowledge and 
motives of all those involved in the situation is erroneous. In terms of current 
research, there is evidence to suggest the efficacy of intervention strategies 
with people with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities. However, the studies investigating these strategies have not 
examined the knowledge and motivations of the communication partners of the 
person with a disability. The current study highlights the marked difference in 
the knowledge and motives of scientist practitioners and disability support 
workers, and the need to acknowledge and consider these differences in 
worldviews before initiating, or as part of, the intervention process.  
 
According to Edwards (2007): 

 
208 
 
- 
Strong forms of agency are necessary for professional practice in 
complex settings and can be learnt. 
- 
Such agency needs to be evident outside the institutional shelters of 
established systems. 
- 
Individual agency can be strengthened through a capacity for joint 
attention (Edwards, 2007, pp. 8-9).  
- 
It is possible to contest interpretations of the object of activity, while 
working within sets of professional values. 
- 
The nature of the object of activity mobilises and changes.  
- 
Relationships are fluid, collaborations may be with different people, and 
relationships may shift within the action. 
- 
Expanding objects of activity occur within co-evolving systems. 
 
As mentioned previously, a limitation of intervention studies to date is that it is 
unclear whether the interventions are aligned with the values and priorities of 
staff, and the extent to which any mismatch in values and priorities might 
influence or affect intervention outcomes. However, in light of the findings from 
phase two of this study, the accounts and perceptions of support staff could 
lead us to believe there is no need for intervention. There is a need to 
problematise this situation in a meaningful way for disability support workers 
who work with adults who communicate nonsymbolically. A dialogue between 
scientist practitioners and disability support workers which necessarily 
challenges epistemological commitments is required in order to determine a 
shared goal or object of activity. As Edwards (2009) states “if object of activity 

 
209 
 
and object motives are not aligned in the same way for each collaborator, 
attention needs to be paid to aligning their motives.”   
 
Further investigation is required to determine different professional groups’ 
understanding of the good life, belonging and happiness, as their alignment is 
important to bring coherence across their specialist practices. This is the first 
stage of a three-stage process of preparation prior to relational engagement 
(Edwards, 2009). As a first step in this process, quality of life measures, such as 
the Quality of Life – Profound Multiple Disability (Petry & Maes, 2009a), could 
be used to start discussion around the experiences of clients in relation to 
belonging and relationship building. This could provide an opportunity to 
determine and negotiate shared objects of activity between different 
professionals 
working 
with 
adults 
who 
communicate 
nonsymbolically.  
Conversations are required about how we determine what constitutes a good 
life, belonging and happiness, and draw into question current epistemological 
commitments and social and cultural expectations.  
 
With regard to the second and third stages stated above, how the good life is 
valued and evaluated is one of the multiple points upon which the perspectives 
of scientist practitioners and disability support workers are dissonant. It appears 
that the staff who are responsible for mediating the experiences of adults with 
congenital deafblindness have a perspective on this lack of opportunity that 
differs from what is typically valued in the research literature. This could feasibly 
present as a barrier to the enhancement of practice. In identifying these 

 
210 
 
differences in worldview, the current study has started to elucidate the values, 
categories and motives which require discussion in order to negotiate action 
with regard to the good life for adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 
Edwards’ description of the two-stage process of relational agency within a 
constant dynamic is clearly applicable and valuable in addressing the nature of 
interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities. These stages are: 
1.  Working with others to expand the ‘object of activity’ or task being worked on, by 
recognising the motives and the resources that others bring to bear as they 
interpret it 
2.  Aligning one’s own responses to the newly enhanced interpretations with the 
responses being made by the other professionals to act on the expanded object 
(Edwards, 2009, p. 39). 
 
The current study has commenced the process involved in this first stage 
articulated by Edwards. It has recognised some of the motives and resources of 
both scientist practitioners and disability support workers to expand an 
understanding of the good life for adults with congenital deafblindness. Clearly 
there is much more work to be done, however again, this affirms the need for 
seeking and working with multiple perspectives, and the value of qualitative 
methodologies.  
 
There is little evidence of the second stage of relational agency in the scientific 
literature on work between scientist practitioners and disability support workers. 
Current intervention and research methodologies utilised in the field of 
congenital deafblindness require adaptation or expansion in order to support 
and facilitate these processes of relational agency to benefit all involved. 

 
211 
 
As discussed above, the current methodologies used in intervention studies 
with adults with congenital deafblindness are largely lacking in genuine 
reciprocity between researchers and participants. In addition, the role and value 
of relational agency is not addressed. In the next section I discuss 
methodologies that may help to tackle this situation. In particular, two mutually 
compatible approaches to research: Integral Theory and Action Research. Both 
are capable of addressing the complexities of researching interactions with 
adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 
Recommended philosophical and theoretical frameworks 
Integral Theory  
Integral Theory is a relatively new approach to addressing and understanding 
multifaceted complex phenomenon. It offers a useful framework for considering 
both research and intervention with regard to the good life for people with 
congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.  
There are multiple perspectives, social, political, economic and cultural factors 
influencing and impacting on the situation for adults with congenital 
deafblindness. An Integral Theory framework can help to ensure each of these 
elements is considered and addressed in progressing what is a complex 
situation. “An integral approach ensures that you are utilizing the full range of 
resources for any situation with the greatest likelihood of success” (Wilbur, 
2006, p. 2). 
 

 
212 
 
Integral Theory, as a result of its applicability within, across and between 
disciplinary boundaries, has a wide range of applications. It has been used in 
fields such as healthcare, organisational management, ecology, economics, 
psychotherapy 
and 
community 
development 
(Esbjorn-Hargens, 
2010; 
Hochachka, 2010). In looking at the residential settings of adults with congenital 
deafblindness as communities, Integral Theory’s applicability across disciplines 
is valuable. It ensures the perspectives of all members of the community, 
regardless of role or discipline (e.g., resident, clinician, disability support worker, 
or family member), are valued and accounted for. This is also consistent with 
applying the notion of relational agency as discussed earlier.    
 
According to Integral Theory, there are at least four irreducible perspectives 
which must be considered in the process of coming to understand any given 
topic or issue. Ken Wilber first introduced the integral approach and these 
perspectives in a quadrant model in 1995 (Esbjorn-Hargens, 2010). The four 
perspectives are: in the upper left quadrant, subjective (I, intentional); in the 
lower left quadrant, intersubjective (we, cultural); in the upper right quadrant, 
objective (it, behavioural); and in the lower right quadrant, interobjective (it is, 
social) (see Figure 1).  
 
 
 
 
 


 
214 
 
associated with the lower right quadrant include dialogue, participatory 
methods, focus groups, participant-observer techniques, and appreciative 
inquiry. Practices associated with the upper left quadrant include self-reflection, 
self-inquiry, counselling, journaling, and meditation. It is worthy of note that 
participant-observer techniques potentially fall within the realm of Video 
Interaction Guidance techniques. These were discussed in chapter three and 
are becoming increasingly popular as an intervention technique to enhance 
interactions with people with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities. However, when used in these contexts, the qualitative 
aspect of their transformative nature is not well documented or understood. The 
majority of research in this field has been of a quantitative nature. Few 
researchers who are working with the communication partners of people with 
disabilities have documented any reflections on the interpersonal or cultural 
aspect of their interventions. This is discussed further below in the context of a 
literature review of papers focusing on interactions with people with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities.   
 
Applying these perspectives to the examination of the good life for adults with 
congenital deafblindness we can see there are at least three subjective, 
personal perspectives: that of the scientist practitioner, that of the disability 
support worker, and that of the adult with congenital deafblindness. It should be 
noted there is much work to be done to develop technologies which better 
contribute to an understanding of the perspective of adults who cannot self-
report. Nevertheless, there are a variety of observable behaviours associated 

 
215 
 
with the upper right quadrant within interactions as exemplified by most of the 
research in this field to date. For example, appropriate and inappropriate 
educator responses (see Janssen et al., 2003a), child and teacher actions and 
reactions (see Vervloed et al., 2006), and initiatives, confirmations, answers, 
turn taking, turn giving (see Janssen, Riksen-Walraven, Van Dijk, Huisman, & 
Ruijssenaars, 2011). The social, political and economic factors influencing 
policies governing the expectations of behaviour of the staff is associated with 
the lower right quadrant. The cultural context, determining the meanings given 
to interactions between staff and clients, and staff and scientist practitioners, is 
associated with the lower left quadrant. These are particularly important in the 
process of relational agency. 
 
These four perspectives or dimensions are always present at any given 
moment. “Integral theory insists that you cannot understand one of these 
realities through the lens of any of the others” (Esbjorn-Hargens, 2010, p. 36). 
An individual has direct access to experiential, behavioural, cultural and social 
or systemic aspects of any given situation at any given time. So too, the 
quadrants can be applied to a given phenomenon, for example, the good life for 
adults with congenital deafblindness. Thus it offers a more integrated framework 
for both understanding situations and enabling sustainable transformation.  
 
Each quadrant in Wilbur’s model contains levels of development; levels of depth 
within the quadrants on the left hand side, and levels of complexity within the 
quadrants on the right hand side. “The inclusion of levels is important because 

 
216 
 
they allow us to appreciate and better interface with the realities associated with 
each quadrant” (Esbjorn-Hargens, 2010, p. 41). 
 
Integral Theory applies a framework of quadrants, levels, lines, states and 
types. To exclude an element in any inquiry or explanation is to settle for a less 
comprehensive understanding of, or a reduced engagement with, reality 
(Esbjorn-Hargens, 2010). However, constraints of time and funding on research 
in the current climate are prohibitive to employing the full range of elements 
involved in Integral Theory. Notwithstanding this, addressing the first two 
elements of quadrants and developmental levels can still provide a considerably 
more integrated model than most other available research approaches.  
 
Another advantage of an Integral Theory approach over other theoretical 
frameworks is its demonstrated capacity to address sustainable development. 
“Increasingly development practitioners recognise that people’s interiority 
(feelings, beliefs, worldviews) influence and inform development interventions” 
(Hochachka, 2010). Sustainable approaches require individual needs to be met 
and “as an individual’s sphere of consideration and care expands to include 
others beyond oneself, and as that person acts in concert with others who also 
share this expanded worldview, the closer the community or society comes to 
sustainability” (Hochachka, 2010).  
 
The current study has highlighted that most research to date has focused 
primarily on the needs of the adults with congenital deafblindness without 

 
217 
 
paying much attention to the needs of their interaction partners. As is stated 
above, when an individual’s needs are met they are able to expand their own 
focus of consideration to include others. Consequently, scientist practitioners 
must spend more time addressing the needs of interaction partners in order to 
achieve sustainable outcomes for people with congenital deafblindness.  
 
The model in the literature review presented by Hostyn and Maes (2009) to 
demonstrate the key areas examined by researchers when investigating 
interactions with people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities can 
be viewed in terms of the Integral Theory framework of quadrants. In doing this 
we can see aspects lacking from the research approach in work done in this 
area to date. The right and left sides of the quadrants are associated with 
qualitative and quantitative research methods, respectively. Thus to more fully 
understand a phenomenon of inquiry, mixed methods are required. However, 
none of the studies reviewed addressed all four of the quadrants or 
perspectives from which the phenomenon of interacting with someone with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities can be viewed. Only one of the 15 
studies reviewed employed a mixed method design. It is noteworthy that most 
studies in this field centre on the upper two quadrants which address the 
perspectives and behaviours of individuals. Hostyn and Maes (2009) identified 
four studies out of 15 which provide some information about the influence of the 
setting, mostly from the perspective of staff. But much more work is needed to 
better understand if and how factors relating to the lower two quadrants, that is, 

 
218 
 
cultural and social factors, influence interactions with people who communicate 
nonsymbolically.    
 
A limitation of resources necessitates pragmatism in the current research 
environment. Studies such as that conducted by Hostyn and Maes (2009) which 
review current literature in terms of aims, design and findings, are of great 
value. They enable us to gain a more integrated understanding of the 
phenomenon in question, as they can pool the perspectives from different 
Integral Theory quadrants.    
 
Applying an Integral Theory approach to the current study indicates that it has 
not considered the lower left quadrant, that is, the household co-created culture, 
or the lower right quadrant (its), that is, how organisation and government 
policies influence the situation and staff behaviours. There is clearly a need to 
examine what is occurring from the perspective of these lower quadrants. Given 
the current emphasis in governmental and organisational policies on community 
inclusion and community capacity building, it is of concern that the 
fundamentals of social interaction and relationship building are not evident as 
priorities in the discourse of those mediating support. As Reinders (2002) 
argues, community is an experience, not a place. It is beyond the scope of this 
thesis to address this issue more fully. But it is recommended that for a more 
comprehensive understanding of the situation for adults with congenital 
deafblindness that the perspectives from these lower quadrants are included in 
future research.  

 
219 
 
 
Participatory Action Research  
This section does not go into a detailed account of Participatory Action 
Research. Rather, it gives a broad overview of the philosophical underpinnings 
of the approach and presents the key features that address the issues raised in 
this thesis. In this section I also present some key issues to be mindful of if the 
approach is to be used in the context of residential services for adults with 
congenital deafblindness.  
 
The current study has revealed a number of concerns with typically used 
methodologies employed when investigating interactions of adults with 
congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities, as well as intervention studies aiming to enhance and improve these 
interactions. Participatory Action Research offers an alternative methodology for 
research in this field which addresses many of the concerns raised by the 
current study. The term Participatory Action Research encompasses a variety of 
approaches and has broad origins in human rights activism. Three attributes 
distinguish Participatory Action Research: shared ownership of research 
projects, community-based analysis of social problems, and an orientation 
toward community action (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000). There is inherent value 
in taking a community action orientation, given that research with adults with 
congenital deafblindness necessarily takes place within the communities to 
which they belong. In addition, as identified in the above section on Integral 

 
220 
 
Theory, few researchers have addressed the perspective of the lower left 
quadrant which relates to the perspective of the cultural, we.   
 
The application of Participatory Action Research to the residential communities 
of adults with congenital deafblindness is somewhat different to its traditional 
applications to communities who are oppressed and marginalised, often living in 
developing countries. However, the current study, combined with the available 
literature, consistently points to the need for development within the residential 
communities of adults with congenital deafblindness and those with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. Indeed, one of the central issues to emerge 
from this study is that disability support workers do not view the extreme 
disengagement and limited opportunities for experiencing the good life of clients 
as a problem, and thus see no need for research. This again indicates that the 
needs of the staff should be examined more closely; as mentioned above it is 
only when individuals’ needs are met that their sphere of care can expand. 
 
Despite the setting being different to those in which Participatory Action 
Research has been traditionally undertaken, its central processes are well 
suited to addressing the issues inherent in typical research methods used in 
intervention studies with people with congenital deafblindness discussed above. 
The features of this methodology which address these issues are as follows. 
- 
It recognises that there are differences between the frameworks and 
models used to understand and interpret reality by health professionals 
and by the people they are working with.  

 
221 
 
- 
It allows respect and empathy for the insights and knowledge people 
from different backgrounds have and the issues they face. 
- 
It helps to avoid mistakes and develop programs that take into account 
the cultural, socioeconomic and political  influences on the outcome of 
programs (De Koning & Martin, 1996). 
 
Various names are used for very similar processes of research. Here, I am 
using the term Participatory Action Research. However, any action research 
method necessarily emphasises participation. This is noted by Greenwood and 
Levin (2007) who state that action research is composed of a balance of three 
elements: action, research, and participation. It is important to understand that 
Participatory Action Research means different things to different researchers 
and that it is not a method per se, but rather a methodology influenced by 
phenomenology, hermeneutics and feminist theory (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). 
Both quantitative and qualitative research methods may be employed within a 
Participatory Action Research project. However, qualitative methods, such as in 
depth interviews, focus groups, life histories and participant-observation are 
most commonly used (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). “Participatory Action 
Research aims to create new forms of knowledge through a creative synthesis 
of the different understandings and experiences of those who take part” 
(Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005).  
During Participatory Action Research, a key criterion for evaluating the quality of 
the research is to evaluate the quality of the participation. De Koning and Martin 
(1996) suggest the quality of participation is evaluated by questioning: does 

 
222 
 
community participation happen at all stages of the research? Which groups in 
the community represent which parts of the process? However, as articulated 
by Hochachka (2010), participation is not a panacea and participatory 
methodologies require further work to achieve two key outcomes. First, the 
capacity of practitioners to employ participatory methodologies, and second, 
that the methodologies necessarily facilitate an understanding of the 
participants and the process of empowerment (Hochachka, 2010). “To work 
with participatory approaches effectively, requires a new understanding of 
development that is internalized in our institutions, interactions, attitudes and 
mind sets” (Hochachka, 2010, p. 24).  
 
One of the central issues to emerge from this study is that disability support 
workers do not view the extreme disengagement and limited opportunities for 
experiencing the good life as a problem, and thus see no need for research. A 
research space is therefore required in which all participants’ perspectives can 
be contributed, acknowledged and valued equally.  
One of the unique qualities of PAR [Participatory Action Research] is that the 
research project should serve the shared interests of both the researchers and 
the researched community. In achieving this, a complex negotiation process is 
needed and most often it involves a shift of power between the researcher and 
the community (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005, pp. 195-196). 
 
Integral Theory and Participatory Action Research processes offer philosophical 
and theoretical frameworks which address many of the issues inherent in the 
research carried out to date with people with congenital deafblindness and their 
interaction partners. The following section examines how a research and 
practice method might be operationalised within these philosophical and 

 
223 
 
theoretical frameworks. Some Participatory Action Research projects begin with 
an intervention and, through this intervention, participation and dialogue lead to 
further development (Liamputtong & Ezzy, 2005). This approach fits well with 
the action research cycle, which involves repeated cycles of planning, acting, 
observing or collecting data or information, reflecting and reviewing, then 
starting the cycle again. Video Interaction Guidance (see Kennedy, Landor, & 
Todd, 2011) offers a potential means for achieving this and it is discussed in the 
next section.  
 
Potential methods for operationalising the good life in research and 
practice  
Intervention studies in the fields of congenital deafblindness and profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities are starting to recognise the advantages of 
adopting a more participatory approach. As mentioned in chapter three, 
approaches such as Video Interaction Guidance and Marte Meo, which utilise 
the analysis of naturally occurring interactions which have been video recorded, 
are becoming increasingly popular. These approaches share some common 
philosophical underpinnings with Participatory Action Research. They both 
involve knowledge creation and learning through action and reflection. The 
Hanging Out Program (Forster, 2008), recommended as an intervention in 
chapter five to increase interactions between staff and clients, sits perfectly with 
Video Interaction Guidance. The filmed interaction is essentially a hanging out 
or HOP session. Video Interaction Guidance adds to the Hanging Out Program 
because it enables staff to observe their interactions and reflect on them with a 
trained guide. 

 
224 
 
 
This type of approach also addresses a key issue raised in chapter two. That is, 
evaluation of an interaction with a person with congenital deafblindness requires 
both a sound knowledge of the theory underpinning the evaluation tool as well 
as personal knowledge of the person with congenital deafblindness. Video 
Interaction Guidance is a collaborative process whereby the guide, a person 
with a sound knowledge of theories of human communication development and 
human interaction, works with the communication partner of a person with 
congenital deafblindness. As a result, both gain greater insights into the needs 
of both interaction partners. Consequently, this approach largely addresses the 
need for these two specific knowledge sets, which is required for a more 
thorough evaluation of an interaction.   
 
However, most research to date that has involved Video Interaction Guidance 
with people with deafblindness has used quantitative research methods to 
evaluate its efficacy. As mentioned in chapter four, this limits the research 
participants’ involvement in determining what is important to measure or 
evaluate. Using a more participatory research approach and more qualitative 
methods initially during a Video Interaction Guidance based intervention, would 
produce a more shared and collaborative approach to determining what needs 
to be evaluated and how. This approach is consistent with the process of 
relational agency discussed earlier in this chapter. In addition, as Video 
Interaction Guidance necessitates the filming of interactions, the videos can be 
observed and coded post hoc once the scientist practitioner and disability 

 
225 
 
support worker have negotiated what there would be value in coding. If a 
quantitative approach is agreed upon, the recommendations with regard to 
coding and determining interrater reliability, which arose from the first phase of 
the study in this thesis, should be considered. However, all aspects of the 
research process would necessarily be discussed and negotiated between all 
research participants.  
 
The outcome of this process would essentially be a means for operationalising 
the good life. This could take into consideration the need for a knowledge of the 
theories around quality of life and human communication development 
(responsibility of the scientist practitioner), the need for knowledge specific to 
the individual with deafblindness (responsibility of the disability support worker), 
the need for a co-created understanding of what the good life looks like for 
specific individuals, and the need for the research participants to have equal 
control in all aspects of the research process.  
 
A potential tool that could be used for both intervention and evaluation in 
relation to increasing and enhancing opportunities for adults with congenital 
deafblindness to experience the good life is the Scale for Dialogical Meaning 
Making (see Hostyn et al., 2009). This tool was mentioned in chapter two when 
looking at potential ways of operationalising the good life and in chapter five 
when examining the merits of consensus coding. The more collaborative 
approach to coding and sound theoretical underpinnings in this tool means it 
has strong potential to address some of the issues with current methods for 

 
226 
 
evaluating interactions. Nevertheless, its concept dense language would most 
likely be alienating to disability support workers. Therefore, further work would 
be required to explore how disability support workers perceive and express the 
concepts of the Scale for Dialogical Meaning Making. This could enable the 
language of the coded features of interaction to be changed to make it more 
accessible to them. These features could be negotiated by the scientist 
practitioner during Video Interaction Guidance sessions, and then videos of 
interactions with the same person with congenital deafblindness could be 
analysed using the negotiated codes and the consensus coding approach.    
 
Depending on evaluation methods determined by the scientist practitioner and 
disability support workers within the context of a Participatory Action Research 
project, it is feasible and likely that the upper two and lower right quadrants of 
the Integral Theory framework of quadrants would be considered. However, I 
suggest there is great value in explicitly stating at the start of the research that 
current policy with relation to quality of life will be examined and interpreted by 
the community. An explicit statement should also be made at the outset that 
findings and learnings from the research process will be disseminated to policy 
makers in order to help inform and shape policy around quality of life for people 
with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. 
This ensures that the lower right quadrant is also addressed and incorporated 
into the process. The following section elaborates on the need for this 
information within the research process.  

 
227 
 
The need for specific policies  
There is very limited information available about the impact of organisational 
and government policies on staff behaviours. As seen above when presenting 
the ways in which phenomena are examined using Integral Theory, it is 
imperative that the external social world, the sphere of the lower right quadrant, 
is considered, to have a full understanding of the situation. The need to address 
the influence of the external social world is highlighted by the current emphasis 
on community inclusion and community capacity building in government policy. 
It is of concern that the fundamentals of social interaction and relationship 
building are not evident as priorities in the discourse of those mediating support, 
particularly given that, as Reinders (2002) argues, community is an experience, 
not a place. For people with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual 
and multiple disabilities it seems that there are some precursors to community 
inclusion which need to be addressed in organisational policy and staff 
development. These include the importance of supporting frequent, sustained 
and pleasurable social interactions, including with peers, family members and 
paid staff. However, based on the current findings, it cannot be taken for 
granted that these social interactions, fundamental to achieving what Reinders 
(2002) refers to as the good life, will occur. The expectation and the means by 
which they are to occur need to be made explicit in policy, service standards, 
procedures, and in staff development. As mentioned in chapter two, this thesis 
is not advocating that disability support workers become friends with the clients 
they support. Instead, I am arguing that disability support workers provide, as 
part of their work role, opportunities for intimacy, social togetherness and an 

 
228 
 
experience of the good life. The aim of this is to optimise the quality of life of the 
adult they are working with. To achieve this, such an objective must be made 
explicit in policy and procedural documents. 
 
Additional issues for consideration  
While I have recommended an Integral Theory approach be taken to ensure 
sustainable outcomes of intervention with adults with congenital deafblindness, 
considerable work is required in addressing the perspectives of all participants 
from all four quadrants. As demonstrated by the literature review of Maes et al. 
(2007), multiple studies can lead to a more integrated understanding of what is 
occurring in a given situation. There would be great value in scientist 
practitioners working together collaboratively, but examining intervention 
approaches from different Integral Theory perspectives or quadrants.  
 
 
 
 

 
229 
 
Chapter Eight: Conclusion 
 
This final chapter returns to the problem identified at the outset of this thesis 
when I questioned the extent to which adults with congenital deafblindness 
experience the good life. The chapter revisits the issues which became 
apparent when looking at how best to answer this question. Key learnings from 
the thesis are presented. The thesis concludes with a presentation of the 
limitations of the study and the theoretical, philosophical, research and clinical 
implications of the work undertaken in this study.  
 
As described in chapter two, the good life can be operationalised as part of, as 
well as sitting within, the quality of life construct. Quality of life is a term used 
frequently in conjunction with interventions aimed at enhancing interactions with 
people who are congenitally deafblind. But little has been done to evaluate the 
impact of these interventions on the individual’s quality of life, or their 
experience of the good life.  
 
A major aim of this thesis was to investigate Reinders’ (2002) construct of the 
good life in relation to adults with congenital deafblindness. Subsequently, when 
investigating the life experience of adults with congenital deafblindness, three 
key questions emerged.  
 
1. How do we measure the quality of life of adults with congenital 
deafblindness who cannot self-report? 

 
230 
 
2. What are the perspectives of the primary interaction partners of adults with 
congenital deafblindness, namely disability support workers, and how might 
these perspectives contribute to an explanation of the low levels of 
interaction observed in quantitative studies? 
3. What is needed to increase the likelihood that adults with congenital 
deafblindness will experience the good life? 
 
There is much work required to develop valid and reliable measures of good 
quality interactions and relationships, especially for those with complex 
communication support needs, such as those with congenital deafblindness.  
This thesis provides some insights into features that need to be addressed 
when developing such measures, and approaches that could be adopted. 
These are set out below. 
 
1. A mixed method or multiple perspective approach. This thesis highlights 
the value of using a mixed method, or mixed perspective, approach to 
ameliorate the shortcomings of individual methods or perspectives when 
used in isolation. A major issue with only using one method or perspective 
is that it provides only a partial understanding of the phenomenon being 
investigated. However, if only one research method is to be used, then the 
limitations of this method could be at least partially addressed by 
considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. For example, 
scientist practitioners, disability support workers, family members, and 
policy makers.  

 
231 
 
2. The value of drawing upon literature on adults with profound 
intellectual and multiple disabilities to provide potential insights into 
the situation for adults with congenital deafblindness. Given that both 
are low incidence disabilities, and thus will most likely attract less attention 
from researchers than other larger disability groups, there is potential value 
in collaboration between researchers from each field of interest. A good 
example of this type of collaboration is seen in how the Scale for Dialogical 
Meaning Making was developed. Input to the development of this tool came 
from both researchers with backgrounds in working with people with 
profound intellectual and multiple disability and those with backgrounds in 
working with people with congenital deafblindness.  
 
3. The need to more equally involve disability support workers in the 
research processes in which they are involved. The disability support 
workers involved in the current study demonstrated a wealth of knowledge 
about the adults with whom they work: their abilities, disabilities, 
preferences, personalities and typical behaviours. As Schuengel, Kef, 
Damen and Worm (2010) state, the hearts and minds of disability support 
workers are our most valuable resource in working with people with 
profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. When seeking to ensure that 
the commitment, knowledge and skills of disability support workers are 
directed towards the best interests of their clients, it is vital that those 
providing direction and support to disability support workers first understand 
their perspectives. It is possible that past attempts to influence staff 

 
232 
 
behaviour in relation to their clients have not been successful because of a 
lack of alignment between policy, educational strategies and the a priori 
perspective of disability support workers. It is the power of these a priori 
perspectives to influence staff behaviour, and subsequently the experience 
and outcomes for people with congenital deafblindness, that was most 
evident in the findings presented in chapter six.         
 
4. Clear policies and procedures regarding the value and nature of social 
interaction with clients who are nonsymbolic communicators are 
required. Evident in some of the findings of this thesis was that the disability 
support workers are often not applying all that they know about their clients 
to the clients’ best advantage. For these reasons, clear policy, education, 
and effective frontline leadership are critical.   
 
5. The need to foster harmonious relationships between scientist 
practitioners and disability support workers. Insufficient attention has 
been paid to these relationships in the research to date. Yet the 
philosophical perspectives of the social model of disability, relational agency, 
Integral Theory, and Participatory Action Research all concur with the 
importance of fostering and examining these relationships in order to effect 
positive sustainable change for adults with congenital deafblindness.  
 

 
233 
 
Based on the findings of the current investigation, a three-pronged approach to 
increasing the likelihood of adults with congenital deafblindness experiencing 
the good life is suggested.  
 
1. Create opportunities for intentionally building relationships between 
scientist practitioners and disability support workers, and between 
disability support workers and adults with congenital deafblindness. 
The development of these relationships has the potential to increase the 
capacity of the support environment, including the direct support workforce, 
in a culturally sensitive, developmentally appropriate way. Video Interaction 
Guidance (see Kennedy et al., 2011; Kennedy & Sked, 2008), as discussed 
in the previous chapter, shows promise as a means of achieving this. It 
includes all three parties and employs processes consistent with those 
required for sustainable outcomes. The principles and practices of Active 
Support also provide a useful framework with an increasing evidence base 
within which Video Interaction Guidance could be utilised. These and other 
valuable programs have already been developed, but a lot more attention 
should be paid to the rationales and experiences of the direct support staff 
before implementing these programs. Given the critical role direct support 
staff have in the consistent implementation of support and intervention, 
programs that do not take into account the vision, experience and concerns 
of direct support staff run the risk of being ineffective and limiting positive 
change. This would address the lower left quadrant (cultural, we) when 
applying the Integral Theory framework for understanding phenomena, and 

 
234 
 
potentially the upper right quadrant (behavioural, it) depending on the nature 
of evaluating interactions and relationships.  
 
2. Factor time into every day to ensure opportunities to build and expand 
on social interactions and relationships. Such processes need to be 
supported by mechanisms to formally monitor the allocation of this time and 
evaluate its impact on the lives of people with congenital deafblindness, and 
the staff providing their support. The Hanging Out Program (Forster, 2008), 
as discussed in chapters five and seven, suggests a protocol for ensuring 
such time is spent with clients. The principles and practices of reflective 
practice would also support this (see Carroll, 2010). This addresses the 
upper left quadrant of the Integral Theory framework (personal, I) and 
potentially the upper right quadrant (behavioural, it) depending again on how 
this is evaluated. 
 
3. Policies need to support staff in this challenging process by explicitly 
stating that they have a primary role of providing regular opportunities 
for sustained interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness. 
Furthermore, staff rostering and budgeting need to acknowledge and reflect 
these activities as valued priorities. This would address the lower right 
quadrant of the Integral Theory framework (sociopolitical, its).   

 
235 
 
Limitations of this study 
Small sample size 
As discussed in chapter four, the low incidence and heterogeneity of 
deafblindness necessitates certain types of research design. The current study 
used, what is in deafblind research, a typically small sample. It is worth noting 
that nine is actually a much larger than usual sample in research in 
deafblindness. While small sample size means the statistical generalisability of 
the findings is problematic, the results from both phases of the study have been 
found to achieve resonance as discussed at the end of chapter six. Tracy 
(2010) argues that resonance is achieved through a study’s potential value 
across contexts or situations, that is, its transferability. Certainly, both the 
theoretical and practical implications of this thesis have broader application than 
simply being limited to the context of the study. They are broadly applicable to 
any professional context in which team members working with a target group 
have different worldviews. They would apply in most residential facilities, such 
as nursing homes, hostels, generic disability residential services, and day 
services. It is also worth noting that the methods and findings of each phase of 
the study have been published in peer reviewed journals, thus undergoing 
additional scrutiny from those outside the research team involved in the project.  
 
Impact of video recording  
Video recording is becoming increasingly popular and common in research and 
practice with people with congenital deafblindness, yet it is not well understood 
how being video recorded impacts on people’s behaviour. Erickson (1992) 

 
236 
 
suggests that when people agree to be video recorded and trust the researcher, 
a video camera is no more obtrusive than a notepad or audio recorder. 
However, it remains difficult to ascertain the effect on behaviour of being video 
recorded. During the interviews all staff were asked if they thought what had 
been recorded was typical. All staff affirmed that it was, with some saying they 
were a little uncomfortable about being filmed at first but that this discomfort 
passed. It remains wise to exercise caution in presuming that human behaviour 
would have been the same, had it not been observed (see Angrosino & Mays 
de Perez, 2000). 
 
Member checking  
While all staff were asked to read transcripts of their interviews and those who 
responded reported them to be accurate accounts, no feedback was sought 
from staff on the final formulation of the results from the analysis of the 
interviews. Again, as mentioned above, while resonance was achieved, the 
method would have been improved by using a member checking process to 
further strengthen the trustworthiness of the results. This process was not 
possible in the current study due to time and other resource constraints 
(including the availability of the staff), but should be considered in future 
research of this nature.  
 
Variable reliability  
As presented in chapter five, the interrater reliability calculated in the first phase 
of the study demonstrated marked variability. Results for coded categories 

 
237 
 
which achieved less than 60% interrater agreement should be considered with 
caution given that Watkins and Pacheco (2000) specify a criteria of interrater 
reliability of >60% to be acceptable.  
 
Theoretical implications  
The current study highlights the need for adjustments when applying human 
communication development theory (applied successfully with children), to 
intervention with adults with congenital deafblindness. As Forster (2011) 
argues, developmental theories of human communication are relevant to a 
degree when applied to adults with developmental disabilities, such as those 
with congenital deafblindness and profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. 
Indeed, as presented in chapter two, these theoretical frameworks for 
understanding human communication development offer a potential means of 
operationalising the good life. Models and frameworks, such as The 
Developmental Profile (Nafstad & Rodbroe, 1999), the PLAI (Promoting 
Learning through Active Interaction) curriculum (Chen et al., 2007), and the 
Scale for Dialogical Meaning Making (Hostyn et al., 2009) all draw upon human 
communication development theory. They also all highlight important 
processes, such as attunement, reciprocity, turn taking and giving, and 
coregulation of proximity and tempo necessary for mutually pleasurable 
sustainable interactions within which interaction and communication skills can 
be developed. However, Forster (2011) notes a number of reasons why 
interacting with an adult with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities might 
be different to interacting with an infant. These include: restricted movement, 

 
238 
 
limited reaching behaviour and use of gesture, and reduced alertness. All of 
these contribute to fewer behaviours that might elicit attunement from 
interaction partners. These are consistent with the arguments of Ehrlich (2007), 
Nyling (2003) and Janssen (2009) They write about the differences between 
interacting with adults with congenital deafblindness as opposed to children with 
congenital deafblindness, as discussed in chapter two. Theories of human 
communication development have proved useful in shaping guidelines and 
strategies for further developing communication skills with people with 
congenital deafblindness. However, the current study together with Forster’s  
(2011) work, highlight some unique differences for adults. These need to be 
considered and accounted for when applying a developmental framework 
grounded in human communication development theory to their interactions.  
 
Taking an Integral Theory approach (as presented in chapter seven) can 
address these issues without diminishing the value of applying the theory of 
human communication development. Integral Theory provides a more holistic 
perspective and takes into account the sociopolitical and cultural influences on 
the interactions in question. The current study demonstrated the need to 
expand on existing theory in order to account for the differences observed in the 
situation for adults. Integral Theory provides a potential theoretical framework to 
achieve this, and its potential application could be the focus of future research.  
 
 

 
239 
 
Philosophical implications  
As presented at the outset of this thesis, Reinders (2002) argues the need to 
consider the good life for people with intellectual disabilities. One of the key 
contributions of this thesis is the notion that if the relationships between scientist 
practitioners and disability support workers more resembled the relationships 
which Reinders (2002) describes when he is talking about experiencing the 
good life for people with disabilities, the greater the likelihood adults with 
congenital deafblindness may also experience the good life. The philosophical 
underpinnings of the social model of disability, relational agency, and Integral 
Theory, as discussed in the previous chapter, are all consistent with and 
support this assertion. 
 
This philosophical stance means valuing and ensuring that multiple methods 
and perspectives are considered within collaborative, participatory processes 
involving all key stakeholders (most likely scientist practitioners, disability 
support workers, management within disability and government organisations 
and policy makers). This is potentially problematic in the current context. The 
disability sector has extremely limited resources and the research context more 
highly values quantitative methods than qualitative methods. This means 
considerable work is required to promote the value in working with more 
qualitative, participatory, philosophical underpinnings. Nevertheless, I maintain 
that to achieve sustainable systemic outcomes which increase the likelihood of 
all parties experiencing the good life, these more qualitative, emergent 
processes are required.  

 
240 
 
 
Hart (2010) articulates the paradox in the need for interaction partners of people 
with congenital deafblindness to be equals within the interaction while at the 
same time taking responsibility for the outcomes of interaction. This exact 
paradox mirrors what is required of scientist practitioners in working with 
disability support workers. To date these interactions have largely been 
unilateral with little evidence of reciprocity. While it is important to acknowledge 
the inherent power imbalances in these relationships, there is considerable 
scope for a more open discourse within the relationship. This will enable each 
others’ understanding of the situation for adults with congenital deafblindness to 
be expanded, and ultimately progress this situation.  
 
Research implications  
The current study has highlighted a number of issues with methodologies 
typically used to examine interactions with adults with congenital deafblindness. 
It makes a number of key recommendations for future research in this area. 
 
1. That mixed methods, or if not mixed methods at least multiple perspectives, 
are considered in the research process.  
2. That scientist practitioners practice the type of attuned, reciprocal, balanced 
interactions with the participants in their research with disability support 
workers, which they expect disability support workers to practice with adults 
with congenital deafblindness.  

 
241 
 
3. Given the limited numbers of people with congenital deafblindness and 
limited resources to conduct research, it is recommended that scientist 
practitioners with similar research interests work together across state and 
national boundaries to increase the breadth and depth of studies 
undertaken.  
 
Clinical implications  
The worldviews of scientist practitioners and disability support workers differ 
markedly, as evidenced in this study. There is considerable value in using 
Edwards’ (2007, 2009) construct of relational agency to foster harmonious 
relationships between scientist practitioners working in clinical practice and 
disability support workers working with adults with congenital deafblindness. 
The relationships between scientist practitioners and disability support workers 
were explored in chapter three. It was evident that the worldviews of scientist 
practitioners have largely dominated the discourse around interacting with 
people with congenital deafblindness and those with profound intellectual and 
multiple disabilities. In addition, for the most part the sustainability of 
intervention strategies used to date has been questionable. Using the construct 
of relational agency as a backdrop to interactions between scientist practitioners 
and disability support workers will better assist each to understand the needs 
and perspectives of the other. This will ultimately progress the situation for their 
shared clients and help to redress the lack of voice of disability support workers 
in the discourse around interacting with adults they support.   
 

 
242 
 
Closing remarks 
This study has highlighted that both scientist practitioners and disability support 
workers share the object of activity of contributing towards positive emotional 
feelings in the adults with congenital deafblindness with whom they work. I have 
articulated these feelings in this thesis as being an experience of the good life, 
while in their interviews staff articulated this feeling as happiness. The study has 
also highlighted that considerable work remains in both determining how these 
positive feelings are evaluated and how conditions conducive to evoking these 
feelings are created on a regular basis in a sustainable way.  
 
There are power imbalances inherent in both relationships between disability 
support workers and adults with congenital deafblindness, and those between 
scientist practitioners and disability support workers. Yet I maintain that with 
power comes responsibility. It is time for scientist practitioners to take 
responsibility and acknowledge and relinquish some of the power they have in 
order to engage in more reciprocal interactions with disability support workers. 
This will enable us to achieve the shared aim of positive feelings or the good life 
for adults with congenital deafblindness. In turn, this process may make the 
disability support workers’ sphere of care expand, enabling them to relinquish 
some of the power that affects the relationships they have with the adults with 
congenital deafblindness whom they support, and so achieve the all important 
experience of social togetherness that Reinders (2002) asserts as the basis of 
the good life.

Dear … 
 
You are invited to participate in a research project being conducted by RMIT University. This 
information sheet describes the project in straightforward language, or ‘plain English’. Please 
read this sheet carefully and be confident that you understand its contents before deciding 
whether to participate. If you have any questions about the project, please ask one of the 
investigators.   
 
Who is involved in this research project? Why is it being conducted? 
 
This research project is being undertaken by Meredith Prain, as part of a PhD program at RMIT 
University. Meredith is investigating communication between adults with congenital 
deafblindness and those who provide support services. The project is being supervised by Dr 
Keith McVilly and Dr Paul Ramcharan who both lecture in the School of Health Sciences, 
Division of Disability Studies at RMIT University.  
 
The project has been approved by the RMIT Human Research Ethics Committee. Able 
Australia, an organisation providing services to people with deafblindness is in support of the 
research project.  
 
Why have you been approached? 
 
You are either a family member or Guardian of an adult with congenital deafblindness and 
intellectual disability, or a person providing direct support services to adults with congenital 
deafblindness and intellectual disability living in supported accommodation. 
 
What is the project about? What are the questions being addressed? 
 
We know very little about how adults with congenital deafblindness interact and communicate 
with those who provide their support services.  The purpose of this project, the first in a series of 
such studies, is to identify how and why adults with congenital deafblindness and the staff who 
work with them currently interact.  The project will also explore the attitudes and perspectives of 
the staff towards interactions with their deafblind clients.  
 
The key questions to be addressed by this research project are: 

 
246 
 
 
- 
What are the main functions of the interactions between adults with congenital 
deafblindness and their support workers currently? 
- 
How do disability support workers currently view their interactions with adults with 
congenital deafblindness?  
 
It is expected that 8 adults with congenital deafblindness and approximately 12 – 16 disability 
support workers will be involved in this initial study.  
 
If I agree to participate, what will I be required to do? 
 
Adults with congenital deafblindness - Your family member with congenital deafblindness will be 
videoed while at home during interactions with the staff in their house. There will be a person 
with a video camera at the house for approximately 15 x 3 hour sessions. These videos will be 
watched by two different people and the interactions will be analysed.  
 
Disability Support Workers – You will be interviewed about your interactions with the adults with 
deafblindness with whom you work. The interviews will be 1:1 with the researcher and will take 
approximately one hour. Questions asked will focus on what happens during the interaction and 
how you feel about the interactions.  You could also be invited to participate in a small focus 
group.    
 
You will also be videoed during interactions you have with your clients. There will be a person 
with a video camera at the house you work in for approximately 15 x 3 hour sessions. These 
videos will be watched by two different people and the interactions will be analysed.  
 
What are the risks or disadvantages associated with participation? 
 
There are no perceived risks outside the participants’ normal day to day activities. No one will 
see the videos except the researchers and research assistants. What you say and do is 
confidential between yourself and the researchers, except where the researchers are aware of 
any activity that places, or potentially places the person with disability at risk of harm or 
exploitation. In which case, the researchers are obliged to bring this to the attention of the 
appropriate authorities.     
 
If you are concerned about your responses to any of the questions during the interview or if you 
find participation in the project distressing, you should contact Meredith Prain or Dr Keith 
McVilly as soon as convenient. Meredith or Keith will discuss your concerns with you 
confidentially and suggest appropriate follow-up, if necessary.  Alternatively you can speak with 
an advocate or other appropriate person.   
 
What are the benefits associated with participation? 
 
While there are no direct personal benefits to any of the participants in this study, there are 
potentially longer term benefits for both adults with congenital deafblindness and their disability 
support workers. These potential benefits include developing a better understanding of both 
adults with congenital deafblindness and those who support them and thus having an evidence 
base to inform staff training and on which to develop and deliver better services.    
 
What will happen to the information I provide? 
 
Information you provide will be kept in a locked, secure place or in password protected 
computer files.  The research data will be kept securely at RMIT for a period of 5 years before 
being destroyed.   
 
Only the researchers and research assistants will view video footage of you or your family 
member.  
 

 
247 
 
Any information that you provide can be disclosed only if (1) it is to protect you or others from 
harm, (2) a court order is produced, or (3) you provide the researchers with written permission. 
 
It is anticipated that the results will be disseminated in papers for publication and conference 
presentations. However, in any publications or conference presentations, no real names will be 
used when disseminating information and every effort will be made to hide the identity of 
participants.   
 
What are my rights as a participant? 
 
 The right to withdraw your participation at any time, without effecting the services 
provided to your family member or, if you are a staff member, your employment. 
 The right to have any unprocessed data withdrawn and destroyed, provided it can be 
reliably identified, and provided that so doing does not increase the risk for the 
participant. 
 The right to have any questions answered at any time. 
 
What other issues should I be aware of before deciding whether to participate? 
 
This is most likely the first study in a series of studies and you may be requested to take part in 
future research projects. You can of course decline to participate in future studies.  
 
Whom should I contact if I have any questions?

Appendix E: Sample interview 
 
WAL interview 20/10/08 34 mins  
First of all I was wondering if you could just tell me a bit about your background. 
I know you just did that but can you say it again for the tape recorder?  So what 
brought you into this field? 
 
Yeah, so I used to be an IT consultant, um and I took a year off as part of a 
community service program for Extensia where I used to work. And it was 
minimal pay leave for a year and I decided to try disability and I loved it so much 
I decided not to go back to my old job.  
 
That’s pretty impressive. So did they, like did Able Australia pay you or your… 
 
No, um it was equal to unemployment pay for people to go out and do what they 
wanted to do.  
 
Right. 
 
And during that time I decided to do the TAFE course and work part time for 
Able as well during that year. 
 
Right, okay, so the position was advertised at Able? 
 
Yep.  
 
Oh cool. I’ve never heard of anyone coming to Disability that way. Um and can 
you tell me about your last shift? Just talk me through what happened on your 
last shift. Were you here over night?  
 
No I do morning shifts usually.  
 
Yep okay that’s fine.  
 
So just what I do?  Um like what? 
 
Um, I guess just tell me what happened from the time you got here.  
 
Um, well I come in at 7 and whoever does the sleepover the routine is pretty set 
‘cause we all know pretty much who does what. Um so the sleepover person 
will have three people of their choice showered um by the time I come in. Then I 
come in and um shower whoever is still in bed.  
 
So who was it today? 
 
Today was the two guys.  

 
267 
 
 
Mmhmm. 
 
So yeah I did, I showered XX and XX. Just usual, nothing out of the ordinary, 
they were very cooperative, they you know they knew their stuff. You know they 
knew what to do, um and then yeah I gave them breakfast um, got them 
dressed, gave them breakfast, um did the laundry, made the beds while they 
were eating. 
 
Mmhmm. 
 
So when they finished eating what did they do? They um, yeah XX was ready to 
be picked up about quarter past eight and XX was just walking around the 
house um or crawling around the house, whatever he does. Um and then I got 
the bus ready. Um.  
 
So, how, what do you do to get the bus ready? 
 
Oh I just reverse it out of the car port and it’s easier for them to walk straight to 
the door.   
 
Oh great. Yeah that’s a good idea.  
 
So at the end of the rail, I sort of stop the door at the end of the rail so they just 
jump in and they don’t have to wander off somewhere else. They can feel the 
bus at the end of the railing.  
 
That’s really good. 
 
I just, yeah, I don’t know what the other guys do but that’s what I do. So I park it 
right next to the railing.  
 
You don’t know if any of the others do that as well?  
 
No, I think we all do it differently. I think some of them let the clients walk 
around the railing and then into the bus which you could do as well um or you 
can do what I do which is just park it straight just… 
 
Keep it straight. 
 
Yeah, then you can open the door as wide as you want for them to get in and 
not damage the car. Um and then they pretty much walk themselves to the car, 
into the car. Um I seatbelt them and then I get XX into the car last because he 
doesn’t like waiting. He’s quite an impatient bloke. What else? And then I drive 
them to their day service.  
 
Oh okay so whoever comes in in the morning does the bus run. 
 

 
268 
 
Yeah I do the bus run ‘cause the night, they might have had a bad night, didn’t 
have enough sleep or whatever so it’s best not to let them drive the car.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
So that’s our thing here.  
 
Okay. 
 
And then um pick up, yeah drop off the medication. Monday mornings we drop 
off the medication at the chemist after I do the bus run. Um do you want me to 
get into detail or just… 
 
Um… 
 
Like when I drop them off what they do? 
 
Yeah that would be good.  
 
So when I drop XX off at Gateway, it’s just around the corner ‘cause he doesn’t 
like being in the bus. He gets agitated when it’s too warm in the bus, gets 
agitated when it takes too long ‘cause we’re stuck in traffic and agitated at the 
red lights um yeah. 
 
So what does he do when he’s agitated? 
 
He just starts to kick things.  
 
Mmm. 
 
The seat, he starts to bang back, he’s thrashing around the back and he starts 
biting his knuckles. He never hurts us. He doesn’t, he knows, he might reach 
out and sort of touch us but very gently.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
He’ll self-harm and harm property but never other clients or staff. So, he’s good 
that way. But yeah, take him out and pretty much they’re ready to take him into 
the, take him into Gateway. Yeah straight away. 
 
Okay that’s good.  
 
Um, cause they know he doesn’t like to wait too.  
 
[Laughs] He’s got everyone sussed out.  
 

 
269 
 
Um and then I drop XX and XX at um Knox. It’s Scope’s day service. Um yeah 
and it’s all ladies there and it’s quite nice and they do activities. They really 
enjoy going. 
 
What makes you think that? 
 
Um because they come home, they’re just really happy.  
 
Okay. 
 
You can feel their um, not all the time ‘cause I think sometimes they might have 
new staff or try new things, they might get a bit anxious but when it’s set into a 
routine I think they like it. Yep. 
 
And so when you said they come happy, what is it about them? 
 
Um, they just come home really relaxed um you know not fidgety or anxious or 
not um acting abnormal. Well not normal for them. You know. Um ‘cause we 
know what is abnormal for them and we know when they’re not relaxed.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Just yeah. 
 
So they might be vocalising more? 
 
Yeah, jumpy, or they might be noisy in their vocal sounds or they might be, 
might do things that are not normal behaviour, you know like um XX might go 
and sit somewhere that’s not her usual position.  
 
Gee I’ve never seen her do that. 
 
She doesn’t do that but you know for example you know something’s a bit not 
right.  
 
And so what would you do if they are behaving differently? 
 
Um I try to investigate what, you know, why she’s like that medically and what 
happened during day service. Sometimes it happens too with XX when she 
comes home. She’s not quite herself and we sort of we would ask at day 
service how she was.  
 
Mmhmm, okay that’s great. So, you dropped XX and the two women and the 
bus gets the other two.  
 
Yeah the other bus comes before we leave. We leave at 9 and the other bus 
comes pretty early about 8:15, 8:30.  
 

 
270 
 
Mmhmm, okay and then you just come back and do… 
 
And then I finish the cleaning yeah when I come back.  
 
And how do you think the last shift was for the clients.  
 
Um the shift, no, yeah, just routine. Nothing out of the ordinary, just, they just, 
they knew, like I tap XX on the shoulder and she knows that it’s time to get on 
the bus. And I sort of shuffle XX. She knows that yeah yeah it’s time to get into 
the wheelchair and it’s time to, ‘cause she knows she’s not going to the toilet at 
that time, like she just knows, she knows. 
 
‘Cause they’ve got dressed… 
 
Yeah like XX, if I tap her on the shoulder at you know any other time she would 
go to the toilet or she would think that she’s eating but that time she just knows. 
They all know, their, their, what they need to do.  
 
Mmhmm, so the morning is one of the most routine times.  
 
Yeah it’s very structured ‘cause there are just so many things to do.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
And we’ve got a very limited time frame to do it.  
 
Mmhmm and I guess that’s a sign that they enjoy it, that they do get up and… 
 
Yeah, yep, yep, XX was um, he couldn’t wait to go this morning, he was just 
standing by the security door looking out like you know just trying to get out.  
 
Is that unusual? 
 
Yeah, no, sometimes he does that. Sometimes yeah. 
 
It’s a good sign isn’t it? 
 
Yeah.  
 
That they enjoy their placement. It’s interesting, so clearly he likes it but that 
time on the bus. 
 
He doesn’t like it yeah. He just doesn’t like the bus.  
 
Um, and can you tell me about a time that you interacted with each of the 
clients during the last shift. So, yeah, I mean you’ve done that a little bit. Would 
you have interacted with all five clients? 
 

 
271 
 
No, yeah, in some way I would have to, because yeah, I would have to get 
everybody ready or I’d have to tell them it’s time to eat or it’s, but not in a social 
sense, in a sense that oh you know, you have to go to the toilet now or you 
need to you know eat now. It’s time for your medication. It’s more it’s very um 
what do you call it, sort of more… 
 
Functional.  
 
Yeah yeah in the mornings yeah.  
 
So are there times in the day when there is more social?  
 
Yeah that would be in the afternoon or on the weekend. Probably more on the 
weekend than in the afternoon. The afternoon we sort of just let them relax and 
chill out a bit so, yeah other than when we take them to the doctors or whatever. 
 
So can you even think of a weekend or afternoon shift that you’ve worked 
recently and talk about times that you interacted with each of the clients.  
 
Yep. Um, I worked yesterday but yesterday I was pretty much busy doing paper 
work.  
 
Right. 
 
Getting all the um profiles, typing up… 
 
For the audit?  
 
Yeah, I was pretty busy yesterday. XX and I are XX’s key worker so yesterday 
sort of we were doing that um but we took ‘em outside um Saturday and 
Sunday just to sit outside, enjoy the sunshine, get a bit of sun on their skin 
‘cause they’re a bit pale. Um, get on the trampoline with XX. That’s what we did 
this weekend. Yeah, pretty much. Did the paper work.  
 
Okay um and how have you felt about being videoed?  
 
Yeah I’m fine with that. 
 
Okay that’s good.  
 
Yeah yeah.  
 
Do you think it changed the way you would normally be?  
 
Not really, I mean, I’m more conscious obviously of how I’m looking and you 
know but other than that we just do what we need to do.  
 
Mmhmm and do you feel that what was videoed was pretty typical?  

 
272 
 
 
Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah.  
 
Mmhmm okay.  
 
There was one video really early on when you were sitting with XX. 
 
Yeah yeah, yeah. 
 
So could you talk me through that? 
 
Um so in the afternoons we like to usually chill out a bit um except when we 
have to take them out for appointments or whatever. Um when we don’t I like to 
spend a little bit of time, I mean I can’t spend time with all of them. But because 
XX XX and probably XX are more functional. XX just likes being on his own. 
Occasionally he might sort of want a cuddle or you know just follow you round a 
little but he’s not, he just likes being alone.  
 
So what happens if you would approach him?  
 
Um he would just do that (pushes with her forearm) that get away, I don’t want 
you near me um when we introduce new things especially. Um yeah, if he’s 
happy he’s right, if he’s happy we just leave him unless we need to go out for 
some reason.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Um with XX. ‘Cause he’s one of the least functional in the house I find it quite 
difficult to interact with him and know what his response is. A lot of times he’s 
just very disinterested, uninterested. Um, when you get him involved in stuff he 
just sort of, just has this snotty look on his face and he puts his nose up at you. 
Um, and gives you this I don’t know, like a no, I’m not interested, and just sort of 
covers himself with a T-shirt or puts himself in a ball and he’s just not, that’s just 
how he is.  
 
He actually pulls away from the… 
 
He, when you try to get him to do whatever, like maybe play strings with him or 
you know or give him a towel to pull or whatever he’ll just yeah, he’ll just do that. 
So he’s the least sort of you know functional in terms of I don’t know 
cooperative or interested. He’s the least interested is probably the right word.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Um, but XX, XX and XX love interaction from us.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 

 
273 
 
Yep. So it encourages us obviously more to spend some time with them.  
 
Sure, yep okay. So perhaps talk me through that time with XX.  
 
So yeah, before dinner we’ve got a bit of time like about 3:30 to 4:30 before 
cooking and after coming home and afternoon tea that sort of one hour I try to 
spend that hour with someone and that day was XX, giving her, you know she 
gets bored. She can hear us and you know she can hear the TV but um I think 
she gets bored in the afternoon. So I tend to I don’t know, like we don’t take her 
for walks every day but we do something and I was just trying to give her an 
activity to do.  She hadn’t strung beads and pasta for a while so yeah I thought 
I’d let her do that.  
 
Mmhmm and so that’s something she enjoys?  
 
She likes stringing stuff. Yeah. But not all the time. You wouldn’t give her like 
beads and pasta to string every day. She wouldn’t do it.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
But if you bring, it’s like with my son, if with his toys you know I’ll let him play 
with them for a few weeks and then I’ll hide them for a few months and then 
when they come out it’s always, it’s brand new, oh wow. New activities, new 
toys. It save money. 
 
That’s a good strategy.  
 
Yep 
 
What about with XX and XX? 
 
Yep. XX is more like physical so we give her massages. She loves sort of 
physical interaction with us. Um, head massages, shoulder massages, back 
rubs, she loves that or just holding hands and stroking. Yep. She loves touch 
and she’s very gentle. Um we do that with XX.  
 
And so how do you know she loves that.  
 
Because she’ll cuddle up to you when you do it. She’ll watch and she’ll, when 
you go away she’ll grab you and put your hand to wherever she wants you to 
touch her like her head or wherever and ask for more.  
 
Mmhmm good, that’s rewarding.  
 
Yeah she’ll be like, you just know when, she leans into you when you do those 
things.  
 
Mmhmm. 

 
274 
 
 
Yep.  
 
Okay and XX? 
 
With XX lately it’s been a bit harder ‘cause she’s been quite ill.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
And we’ve had to be a bit more careful with her arm.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
‘Cause she had a fracture and it’s still healing.  
 
When was that? 
 
Oh, during day service.  
 
Oh no.  
 
Yeah, so it’s taken her a long time to heal over it. Yeah internally as well. So 
with XX we tend to be more gentle, we, we don’t do as much as we used to with 
XX. 
 
Mmhmm. 
 
‘Cause XX used to really like doing stuff, like play dough, but she’s lost some 
feeling or some movement in one of her arms with the fracture um yeah so it’s a 
bit sad that way.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Or she just likes us tickling her and playing with her like she just has the biggest 
smile on her face like she’s enjoying it. We’ll play peek-a-boo with her, hide her 
face with a blanket. Yeah she loves that.  
 
Someone was telling me that’s a ritual is it before bed? 
 
XX, yeah, XX does that with her.  
 
Oh good okay. 
 
Yeah, she just has the biggest smile on her face.  
 
Good okay, so is there, so there’s things with each of them, even with XX that 
he likes. Is there anything you can think of that XX likes?  
 

 
275 
 
XX has his box of toys, he’s got his box of toys and he pretty much plays with 
them on his own with like his one good arm. So he’ll um I’m not sure if you 
video taped but what he does is, I put it on the side, I think the others do too, I 
put it on the side of his good arm. That’s what I do. You know he’s got one good 
arm um so we put the box on that side all these little toys for him and he knows 
or if he knows that when he sits on his chair like he knows to reach around for 
his box of toys and when it’s not there ‘cause it’s cleaned up it’s not there, oh 
there’s one there, I didn’t see that. He’ll um, yeah we’ll know he’s looking for it.  
 
Because you’ll see… 
 
Yeah sweeping the floor for it and then we’ll bring it over and he spends quite a 
lot of time entertaining himself with all the toys.  
 
Mmhmm 
 
Um putting them in his mouth and then touching it, feeling it and he finds it quite 
hilarious throwing it around the room. It hasn’t hit anyone so it’s not a 
destructive behaviour.  
 
It’s not too far that they go is it? 
 
No. So that’s what he does. 
 
And you can’t join him in it? 
 
Well there’s not really much that we could, other than pick up his toys and put 
them, and he could continue flinging it. ‘Cause when he runs out he just gets 
bored and then he just falls asleep when he’s bored.  
 
Uhuh okay. So you said XX sometimes comes up and will cuddle you? 
 
Yeah he comes up and cuddles us. 
 
So then does that mean he wants… 
 
He wants some time with us yeah.  
 
So what would you do? 
 
So then we’ll just give him a cuddle. Walk around. ‘Cause he holds onto us. 
When we walk around. He cuddles up from the back um so we’ll walk around 
with him hanging onto us from the back um yeah and just let him do that for a 
while until he pushes us away and he’s had enough.  
 
So you just go about your routine  
 

 
276 
 
Yeah we just, yeah yeah yeah. He does, he’ll hold on and if for example I go to 
oh make the lunches or something he’ll just hold on while I make the lunches 
um and he’s not um, he’s not, he doesn’t physically. He doesn’t distract you, like 
he won’t grab my hand and say no don’t butter the bread. He’ll just hold on. 
 
He’s just there.  
 
Yeah. He’ll just hold on.  
 
Does he watch what you’re doing?  
 
He sees through, sort of through one eye. He can see us.  
 
So he’s a bit interested in whatever you’re up to. 
 
Yeah.  
 
Okay okay that’s great. That’s pretty much all I had so is there anything else 
you think’s important to mention or say about working with these clients.  
 
Um I really enjoy working here. With them.  
 
That shows.  
 
I really like working here.  
 
What is it that you think you like? 
 
I don’t know. I’m really happy when I finish my shifts and go home. I feel good.  
 
Terrific.  
 
I feel like I’ve been out and about doing stuff.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Um, obviously this job pays a lot less than what I used to get paid for but it’s 
more um in the community interacting with different people that I like about it.  
 
Okay. 
 
Yeah and it’s not just a nine to five stuck in the office sort of a job.  
 
Sure. 
 
That I like.  
 
Okay that’s great. We’re lucky to have you.  

 
277 
 
 
Yeah.  
 
Okay terrific thank you so much for your time I really appreciate it.  
 
[Stopped interview and then started again when more information came 
up in post interview conversation.]  
 
Oh also, I was just going to say that when they’re at home sometimes they have 
an appointment like with a specialist in the middle of the day ‘cause it’s hard to 
get these appointments we keep them at home. If they’re unwell or, for some 
reason we have to keep them at home  
 
Mmhmm.  
 
Usually we have one or two people at home um it’s often a really good 
opportunity with us, and I know the others do this too, um because the ratio is in 
favour of the staff, it’s either 1:1 or 1:2 depending on the combination of the 
residents  
 
If they have to stay home does the roster change so that someone is there? 
 
Yeah yeah. 
 
You have extra staff right through the middle of the day? 
 
If there are more than four then we have two staff on but if there are only one 
resident or two then there’s just one staff. Like I’ll just stay through my morning 
shift until 2 o’clock. Um and it’s a really good opportunity for us to um take them 
out one on one or one on two and what we usually do is we take them out to the 
grocery shopping, we take them out doing chores with us.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
And they really really like it. They, it’s like a special time um you know they get 
that one on one time with us. Um and we yeah we often do that when they’re at 
home.  
 
And so how do you know they like it? 
 
Um because they’re really good when we go out. Um if they didn’t like it they 
would vocalise, like they would let us know and they would not cooperate with 
us when we go out but all the time they will just go along.  
 
And that’s true of all five of them? 
 
No, no, XX doesn’t like going out, period.  
 

 
278 
 
Okay. 
 
XX doesn’t like going out. We’ve taken him out and he just doesn’t, he really 
doesn’t like it. So we, yeah, he really just doesn’t like, he wants to stay here. 
 
Okay. 
 
XX doesn’t mind either way. Um XX LOVES going out during the day time 
‘cause I might take her out to buy some bread, some milk, or we’ll have a 
coffee, she loves her… she’ll carry the groceries um push the trolley. She loves 
it. XX’s really really great. Um XX you’ve got to push her in but she likes it as 
well ‘cause she’ll feel the air and um XX’s really good as well.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
So XX XX and XX.  
 
You said XX in particular really loves it. What is it she does that makes you 
know that she really… 
 
I don’t know, but she really likes going out. As long as it’s not a noisy place like 
during Christmas time is not a good time to take XX out. 
 
Sure.  
 
But um usually yeah, like she really really really likes it.  
 
Okay, that’s great. So it’s only if they have an appointment.  
 
Yeah, usually if they’re at home and for some reason that they’re at home and 
we stay home with them.  
 
Mmm. 
 
That is a great opportunity to take them out. Yeah ‘cause on the weekends 
‘cause we don’t, we can’t use the bus for the wheelchairs, cause that bus won’t 
allow us to use a wheelchair and the old bus we could only fit in one or two 
wheelchairs and three of them sit in wheelchairs so we’ve got a sort of like a 
transport issue. Logistics with these guys and number of staff um number of 
wheelchairs.  
 
It’s usually two staff to five. 
 
But we’ve got three wheelchairs that need to be pushed so it doesn’t work out if 
we want to go out on the weekends with them it would more likely be… 
 
Could one go out with two? 
 

 
279 
 
Yeah if, one could go out as long as um there is only one wheelchair to push 
and the other so that when we go out because XX needs a wheelchair, XX 
needs a wheelchair um XX needs a wheelchair and XX doesn’t like going out 
you know the chances are you would take XX in the wheelchair and let XX hold 
onto the handle of the wheelchair.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Or take XX out and have XX hold the handles of the wheelchair.  
 
So really, one of the three and XX. 
 
Yeah that’s right.  
 
Uhuh. 
 
Yeah with one staff.  
 
So does that happen sometimes?  
 
Yeah it happens sometimes, yeah when we need to run out and do stuff we’ll 
take them.  
 
Mmhmm. 
 
Yeah but it’s just organising um the…  
 
It’s a bit hit and miss. 
 
Yeah it’s got to be the right place.  
 
Mmhmm. 
  
For, ‘cause you don’t wanna be stuck in a place that’s unfamiliar with two 
unhappy residents.  
 
[Both laugh.] 
 
You just wouldn’t want to be in that situation.  
 
Sure. 
 
Okay that’s terrific to hear that. How often would that happen? 
 
It depends. Like the other day XX took um who did he take. He took XX ‘cause 
XX always gets to go out ‘cause she’s the most physically able and he chose to 
take XX to a BBQ in Croydon ‘cause they have a trampoline and XX loves 

 
280 
 
trampolines. Um when they went there they both chucked a tantrum ‘cause it 
was noisy and there were a lot of people.  
 
Was it at the Croydon house? 
 
Yeah.  
 
Okay. 
 
Yeah they didn’t have a very good time. 
 
Oh that’s a shame. 
 
Yeah. 
 
It was a good idea. Did XX go on the trampoline? 
 
Yeah. He doesn’t like people XX. He likes to be on his own. Yeah.  We’ll try and 
do something else. 
 
So if those situations come up you’ll always give it a go? 
 
Yeah like if there’s an opportunity like we’ll do it, but there’s always that 
possibility, it’s often a really good possibility that they won’t enjoy it and if they 
don’t enjoy it we won’t enjoy it. So yeah. 
 
Mmhmm. 
 
It’s got to be the right combination of place time and resident.  
 
Uhuh and not too noisy, fingers crossed. Would you say most of the time they 
do enjoy it and it only backfires sometimes? 
 
Well I play it safe ‘cause I don’t want to put myself in that situation. I play it safe 
and I know what works. And what works is taking XX out with me one on one 
gong for a walk, going to the shops, doing the groceries and I know that works. 
And I also know that it works with XX and XX and I know that it works with um 
XX and like XX in combination with XX, doing these things with me um but I 
wouldn’t attempt it in a shopping centre or take them for a walk with XX and XX 
or XX and XX ‘cause you know the chances of it turning bad are pretty high.  
 
Yeah sure. And what do you do at the supermarket and shopping centre? 
 
Well um XX just holds onto the side of the wheelchair so I don’t need to guide 
her.  
 
She can just… 
 

 
281 
 
She follows, she holds onto the handle of the wheelchair yeah and I push the 
wheelchair and when I need to buy something XX holds the groceries for me 
and then XX or XX will have the other groceries or whatever on her lap.  
 
Okay great so they’re involved and they know there’s stuff going on.  
 
That’s, it works for me. 
 
Yeah that’s really good for them too. Yeah okay, I’m really glad you said that. 
Okay. Is there anything else? 
 
No, I don’t, not really, unless you’ve got any other questions to ask. 
 
They’re the main questions. That’s really, yeah. 
 
And yeah, that’s just dong that is from learning over time you know.  
 
How long do you think it took you? 
 
Oh it took me a while to um feel comfortable enough to take them to the doctors 
or take them to do things like that because when I started with Able I was a 
respite worker so that helped a lot and coming into the house you know you’ve 
got another staff to help you but when you’re doing respite you’re on your own 
so coming from a more challenging area. 
 
And do you think you learnt a lot from the other staff members?  
 
Yeah we always exchange tips which helps.  
 
Yeah it seems to be a pretty stable group of staff here which is good. I think it 
makes a big difference for the clients.  
 
Yeah and when we do, like we had a new casual um XX come home on the bus 
because she just knows your voice. Her sense of hearing is very acute and she 
just knew this person was new and she she was, she just cracked it you know,  
she started to bang her head, she started to scream, bang her head on the 
ground banged her head against the wall and she hasn’t done that for a long 
long time. 
 
And it was because of the new… 
 
She knew we had a new person um yeah. 
 
So what do you do when that happens? 
 
We medicated her because that staff was sleeping over and she calmed down. 
Yeah she got used to the staff after a few hours. She was fine.  
 

 
282 
 
Okay 
 
Like she was really good after dinner but it was just the first three hours that she 
sort of didn’t.  
 
It’s hard isn’t it? Okay. Great.
