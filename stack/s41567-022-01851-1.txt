strip topology

Topological solitons commonly appear as energy-minimizing field 
configurations, but examples of stable, spatially localized objects with 
coexisting solitonic structures and singular defects are rare. Here we use 
a nonpolar chiral liquid crystal system to show how twist domain walls 
can co-self-assemble with vortices to form spatially localized topological 
objects with spontaneous folding. These soliton–vortex assemblies, 
which we call ‘möbiusons’, have a topology of the molecular alignment 
field resembling that of the Möbius strip’s surface and package localized 
field excitations into folded structures within a confinement-frustrated 
uniform far-field background. Upon supplying energy in the form of 
electric pulses, möbiusons with different overall symmetries of structure 
exhibit folding-dependent rotational and translational motions, as well 
as topological cargo-carrying abilities that can be controlled by tuning 
the amplitude and frequency of the applied fields. We demonstrate 
on-demand transformations between various möbiusons and show 
examples of encoding information by manipulating folds in such 
structures. A model based on the energetics of solitons and vortices 
provides insights into the origins of the folding instability, whereas 
minimization of the Landau–de Gennes free energy closely reproduces 
details of their internal structure. Our findings may provide a route 
towards topology-enabled light-steering designs.
Topological solitons and singular defects can enable diverse physical 
behaviour and technological utility, ranging from dislocation-mediated 
malleability of metals1 to Skyrme–Witten descriptions of elementary 
particles as three-dimensional solitons2–4 and models of cosmic 
string emergence after the Big Bang5. In liquid crystals (LCs), singular 
topological defects, which contain spatial regions where molecular 
ordering directions cannot be defined, typically appear as transient 
structures1,2,5–11, although they can be stabilized by colloidal inclu-
sions, patterned boundary conditions and confinement12–18. Solitonic  
structures in chiral LCs can also stabilize singular point and line  
defects (vortices) against shrinkage or annihilation2,19,20. How-
ever, the morphology of known field configurations containing  
such structures is limited to straight-line or looped configurations  
of twist walls and skyrmions coexisting with singular defects2. In this 
work, we show how solitonic twist walls in a chiral LC can co-self-assemble 
with vortices and then spontaneously fold into diverse spatially  
localized configurations. The nonpolar director field n(r), which 
describes the average local rod-like LC molecular alignment direc-
tion, exhibits highly elaborate, three-dimensional (3D) structures that  
comprise both solitonic and singular regions with the non-orientable 
n(r) tangent to a Möbius strip’s surface. These spatially localized  
excitations, which we call ‘möbiusons’, spontaneously fold into 
diverse structures with different symmetries. We reconstruct and 
numerically model the 3D n(r) by using nonlinear optical microscopy

back to the mesophase (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Video 1), a process  
that allows for embedding topologically nontrivial n(r) configura-
tions. When a voltage of U ≈ 3 V is applied across the LC, this fibre-like  
twisted region spontaneously curves and folds (Fig. 1d and Supple­
mentary Video 1) until eventually relaxing into various stable 
möbiuson configurations (Fig. 1e–i) that emerge depending on the 
originally straight fibre’s length. These emergent möbiusons are 
classified based on the number of folds N (Fig. 1e–i) and the sym-
metry of their polarizing optical micrographs (POMs), where such 
structures with mirror symmetric and right- or left-handed fold-
ing are denoted by NM, NR and NL, respectively. Micrographs of NM 
möbiusons contain a single mirror symmetry plane, character-
ized by the two-dimensional (2D) symmetry group D1 (Fig. 1e).  
Each micrograph of NR or NL structure contains a two-fold rotation 
axis (2D symmetry group C2), whereas NR and NL are mirror images of 
each other (Fig. 1f,g). Even-N möbiusons are either NR or NL, with their 
ends folding counter-clockwise or clockwise, respectively, whereas 
odd-N möbiusons are NM. Among special cases (Fig. 1), möbiusons 
with N = 2 exhibit all three types (2M, 2R and 2L), and the ones with N = 1 
are torons with D∞ symmetry (Fig. 1h)2, denoted by 1∞. Möbiusons can 
and by minimizing the Landau–de Gennes free energy1,10–14, respec-
tively, showing how möbiusons emerge from competing free 
energy contributions. Möbiusons display inter-transformations, 
symmetry-dependent electrically powered rotational and 
translational motions and cargo-carrying abilities that exceed 
the known effects of out-of-equilibrium dynamics of defects  
and solitons6–9.
Emergence and inter-transformation of 
möbiusons
In a glass cell with perpendicular boundary conditions, confine-
ment hinders chiral LC’s tendency to twist, causing frustration  
(Fig. 1a). Möbiusons embed localized fibre-like regions of twisted n(r), 
which spontaneously fold and locally relieve the frustration (Fig. 1a). 
Across these fibre-like regions, n(r) twists by 180° while being tan-
gent to a Möbius strip (as detailed below), the simplest non-orientable  
surface with only one side (Fig. 1b). To create a möbiuson, we first 
apply a voltage of U ≈ 3.5 V and generate an extended fragment of a 
localized fibre-like structure with 180°-twisted n(r) across its width by 
local melting of the chiral LC using laser tweezers and then quenching

inter-transform through the creation and annihilation of folds, pre-
serving or changing 2D symmetries. For example, upon increasing the 
voltage by ~0.02 V beyond the initial equilibrium value, a möbiuson can 
transform into its lower-N counterpart (Supplementary Video 2). This 
fold annihilation process reduces N by 2 with the following selection 
rules: mirror-symmetric möbiusons retain symmetry and transform as 
NM → (N − 2)M, whereas left- or right-handed ones change handedness, 
that is, NR → (N − 2)L and NL → (N − 2)R. However, low-N möbiusons with 
N ≤ 3 are exceptions, where 3M→2M and N = 2 of all symmetries can trans-
form to 1∞. These transformations are summarized in Extended Data 
Fig. 1. To add extra orders of folding to an existing localized excitation, 
one can grab one end of the initial möbiuson with laser tweezers and 
stretch it slowly. After turning off the laser, new folds emerge as the 
elongated möbiuson evolves towards equilibrium (Supplementary 
Video 3) by following the transformation rules in a reverse order. Stable 
möbiusons can be used to encode information, as shown in Fig. 1i for 
the example of ‘CU’.
Three-dimensional structures of möbiusons
To understand the mechanism behind the formation of möbiusons, 
we investigate their internal structures. Before folding, the fibre-like 
translationally invariant feature (referred to as a cholesteric finger21,22; 
Fig. 1c), comprises a twist wall and two vortex lines (twist disclinations) 
at the top and bottom substrates, which turn at the finger’s ends and 
close into a single loop (Fig. 2a–c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). This 
nonsingular wall is a one-dimensional soliton embedded into the  
background n0 of the unwound director field, where one-point  
compactification of its physical space2,23 connects the equivalent  
director orientations after the 180° twist, much like in the case of  
making a Möbius strip from paper (Fig. 1b). A loop of the vortex line 
embeds the twist wall into the n0 background, as seen within the 
cross-sections (Fig. 2a,b), where both the soliton and the vortex are 
labelled as elements of the first homotopy group, π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2). The LC 
order is reduced within the vortex cores and the free energy density is 
much higher as compared with bulk regions1,14, whereas the twist wall 
is energetically favourable due to the LC’s intrinsic chirality (Fig. 2a 
and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). The electric field applied along n0 tends 
to constrain the extent of the twisted region by dielectrically coupling 
to n(r). The energy-minimizing shrinking tendency of the vortex  
line and expanding tendency of the twist wall, both tuneable by  
applied voltage, thus render the linear configuration of co-assembled 
soliton and vortex lines unstable, driving them to curve and fold  
(Figs. 1c–i and 2c–l). Optical micrographs obtained at different depths 
of focus reveal that the twist wall takes a longer spatial trajectory  
while the vortex line adopts a shorter one (Fig. 2j and Supplementary 
Video 4). In high-N möbiusons (Figs. 1i and 2j–l), this leads to multiple 
folded regions, further lowering the total free energy by optimizing 
the geometric configurations of walls and singular vortex lines. The 
formation of möbiusons represents a symmetry-breaking process of 
the initial linear configuration with D2 symmetry of the 2D optical image 
into structures with D1 or C2 symmetry. A special case emerges when 
the initial fibre-like finger fragment is short, so that the two ends inter-
act while curving, eventually merging to yield the 1∞ toron (Fig. 2c–i 
and Supplementary Video 5). We reproduce this transformation in 
numerical simulations using Landau–de Gennes free energy minimiza-
tion1,10–14 and confirm that, when the two ends meet, the total free energy 
is reduced by merging and annihilating the two vertical segments of 
the high-energy π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) = ℤ2 vortex line (Fig. 2c–f). The process of 
merging the finger’s ends transforms a single vortex loop into two 
loops upon reconnection, which then shrink into nanoscale loops iden-
tified as π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) point defects2,24. In the horizontal midplane, the 
ensuing solitonic structure is the π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) skyrmion, which emerges 
from looping and reconnecting the ends of a π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) twist wall 
(Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, the overall topological transformation 
contains reconnection of a single π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) twist vortex loop of zero 
hedgehog charge into two loops after the finger’s ends merge, which 
then become two π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) point defects of opposite relative hedgehog 
charge (±1), as well as the transformation of a π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) twist wall frag-
ment into a π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) skyrmion tube terminating at the π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) point 
defects. Remarkably, this transformation between topological objects 
of different homotopy classes23 is driven by free energy minimization 
(Fig. 2f) and involves embedding the solitonic structures into the back-
ground n0 by singular defects of the same homotopy group, both before 
and after the transformation.
To further probe the 3D structures of möbiusons, we utilize 
three-photon excitation fluorescence polarizing microscopy 
(3PEF-PM)25 synergistically combined with the structural analysis  
based on minimizing the free energy10–14. The 3PEF-PM imaging  
with different polarizations of the excitation laser light allows for the 
reconstruction of n(r), which then serves as initial conditions for the 
Landau–de Gennes free energy minimization, yielding the equilibrium 
3D structures used to simulate 3PEF-PM images (Methods). The  
agreement between the computer-simulated and experimental  
images validates the n(r) reconstruction (Fig. 3, Extended Data Figs. 4 
and 5 and Supplementary Video 6), revealing the 3D morphology  
of the co-assembled vortex lines and twist walls. Around the folds,  
the twist wall bulges, allowing a larger region of favourable twist  
while constraining the length of the energetically costly vortex line 
(Fig. 3i–q and Extended Data Fig. 6), revealing the vortex’s shrinking 
tendency and the twist wall’s expanding tendency. The vortex line  
of 2M displays mirror symmetry with respect to the vertical plane  
containing the D1 mirror plane, but its overall 3D configuration is  
asymmetric with respect to the cell’s horizontal midplane (Fig. 3a–c,g, 
i–k, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Video 6). The vortex 
loop of 2R (Fig. 3d–f,h,l–n and Extended Data Fig. 6b) exhibits  
the two-fold rotation symmetry with respect to the vertical axis along 
its centre but is also asymmetric with respect to the cell’s midplane. 
The handedness of folding, determined when viewed along the  
cell substrate’s normal, the +z direction, correlates with the vortex  
loop symmetry, so that the 3D n(r) of 2R and 2L and all the right–left 
versions of möbiusons can be obtained from one another by flipping 
the LC sample upside down (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8). 
Although POM images of 2R and 2L distantly resemble twistions19,20,  
3D imaging reveals different topology as these möbiusons comprise 
π1(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2) = ℤ2 vortex lines whereas twistions contain π2(𝕊𝕊2/ℤ2)  
point defects. The up–down asymmetry of high-N möbiusons manifests 
itself at the opposite ends of these structures, although they  
are symmetric with respect to the cell midplane within the central 
regions comprising many repeated folds (Extended Data Fig. 8b).  
For möbiusons with many folds, lateral displacement amplitudes  
of the twist wall Dt and the vortex line Dv from the average centre­line 
and the periodicity of folding L vary with temperature, and the  
voltage U and the periodicity TU of the oscillating electric field  
(Fig. 4). By minimizing the free energy as a function of L, we find that 
the folded structure has lower free energy than the unwound state or 
the straight finger, with the equilibrium configuration featuring 
L/Dt ≈ 1.76, close to the experimentally measured ratio of L/Dt ≈ 1.84 
(Fig. 4c).
Folding instability within the möbiuson
To gain insights into the möbiuson formation, we constructed an ana-
lytical model based on the minimization of the free energy including 
the vortex lines and the twist wall. The energy density of the vortex line 
Fv contains contributions from its singular isotropic core (Fc) and elas-
tic deformations of n(r) around it (Fn
v). Fc can be estimated based on 
the energy difference between the isotropic and nematic phase and 
the radius of the isotropic core (rc). To evaluate Fn
v, we parameterize 
n(r) around the top vortex line along y in a möbiuson by using the ansatz

where the radial integral from rc to p/4 is consistent with the observa-
tion that n(r) rotates by π/2 from the far-field alignment to its centre 
on either side of the vortex. The shrinking preference of the vortex line 
is manifested by Fv > 0 (Fig. 4e). To calculate the energy for the twist 
wall, we assume an ansatz of nt = (0, sin(

uniform twist rate and width w (Fig. 4d). The associated linear energy

increasing |E|, consistent with experiments. The free energy of the twist 
wall is lower than that of the far-field background, implying an expand-
ing tendency, or spontaneous folding in presence of a length-expanding 
constraint (Fig. 4e,f). Considering möbiusons observed in experiments 
and simulations (Figs. 1 and 4c and Supplementary Video 1), we assume 
that the vortex lines and twist wall follow sinusoidal paths around a 
common centreline (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8a) while having 
different displacement amplitudes Dv and Dt, respectively, interrelated 
by an effective width w = weq + |Dt −Dv| sin (

difference within a folded structure allows the expansion tendency of 
the twist wall to be fulfilled while reducing the energy penalty due to

The twist wall energy density in a möbiuson decreases with Dt 
(Extended Data Fig. 9a), whereas that of the vortex lines increases 
with Dv (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Minimization of equation (4) yields 
a structure with an equilibrium L = 11.2 μm and L/Dt ≈ 1.75, consist-
ent with experiments (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 9c). Changes of 
twist wall displacements with varying |E| also qualitatively agree with 
experiments (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Increasing Dt from 0 reduces the 
overall energy, revealing the folding instability of the linear fibre-like 
structure (Dt = 0) and how möbiusons emerge from the competition 
between the voltage-dependent shrinking tendency of the vortex line 
and the expanding tendency of the twist wall (Extended Data Fig. 9).
Self-propulsion of möbiusons and control of 
topological cargo
When subjected to an oscillating field applied across the cell, along n0, 
möbiusons exhibit rotational and translational motions (Fig. 5a–c) 
dependent on their symmetry. In our LC with positive dielectric ani-
sotropy, the oscillating electric field tends to rotate the möbiuson’s 
n(r) towards n0, periodically squeezing it. The balances between the 
electric, elastic and viscous torques while periodically varying the 
applied voltage originate nonreciprocal dynamics of n(r) structures2,6 
and squirming motion of particle-like möbiusons dependent on their 
symmetry. NM and NR,L structures exhibit electrically powered transla-
tions and rotations, respectively. Meanwhile, 1∞ torons retain their axial 
symmetry in an oscillating electric field and display only Brownian 
motion, differently from LCs with negative dielectric anisotropy, where 
squirming motions emerge along with field-induced symmetry break-
ing of n(r) structures6–8. The linear and angular velocities of möbiusons 
with different symmetries (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Videos 7–9) 
depend on the frequency f of the applied field. For example, the trans-
lational speed of 2M peaks at 0.4 µm s−1 for f ≈ 100 Hz (Fig. 5a,d and 
Supplementary Video 7). Above 100 Hz, the speed decays exponentially 
with f. Above 1,000 Hz, the translational motion of NM is indistinguish-
able from Brownian motion (Fig. 5a). At f ≲ 100 Hz, NM become unsta-
ble and shrink following the transformation rules (Fig. 4b and Extended 
Data Fig. 1). The angular speeds of NR,L rotations depend on f, peaking 
at low frequencies and decreasing exponentially with f (Fig. 5b). The 
translational and angular speeds decrease as N increases. The direction

for 2R and 2L and for NR and NL (Fig. 5c), consistent with the fact that the 
left–right versions of möbiusons have similar 3D n(r) and differ only 
in terms of their 3D orientations relative to cell substrates (Supple-
mentary Video 9).
Möbiusons can induce dynamics of high-symmetry topologi-
cal solitons, such as torons, hopfions and skyrmions with axisym-
metric n(r), which by themselves do not exhibit electrically powered 
motion in LCs with positive dielectric anisotropy. Möbiuson–soliton 
interactions (Fig. 6a) impart co-propulsions as shown by the solitons’  
trajectories for 2M translating a toron (Fig. 6b), a skyrmion bag  
(Fig. 6c) and a hopfion (Fig. 6d) as topological cargos (Supplementary  
Video 10). Interesting dynamics emerge from the rotational  
motion of the 2R interacting with a toron, which could be called  
‘topological dancing’ (Fig. 6e, Supplementary Video 10). Compared 
with the self-propelling speed, 0.4 µm s−1, of 2M at 100 Hz, the speeds  
of 2M–soliton complexes for torons, skyrmion bags and hopfions 
are 0.25, 0.07 and 0.15 µm s−1, respectively, whereas the linear speed 
along the ‘dancing’ trajectory in Fig. 5e is 0.26 µm s−1. The different  
co-propulsion speeds stem from the different effective viscous 
drag forces of these möbiuson–soliton assemblies, calling for their  
systematic analysis.
Conclusions and outlook
Möbiusons exhibit diverse folded configurations of co-assembled 
twist solitons and singular vortices in the order parameter field, both 
being topological mimics of the Möbius strip. Their non-orientable 
field configurations cannot emerge in polar systems, such as magnets 
or ferroelectrics, but potentially could have counterparts in other 
systems with nonpolar order parameters1, in polarization fields of 
light26 and in other branches of science ranging from particle physics 
to cosmology3–5,21. Electrically powered emergent self-propulsions  
show möbiuson stability under out-of-equilibrium conditions and 
might help establish LCs as model systems to explore active matter 
behaviours and to transport cargo at the mesoscale27. While the con-
finement used in our work partially limits the diversity of folded con-
figurations, even more possibilities could exist without confinement, 
including vortex–soliton assemblies with knotted configurations and 
Möbius-strip-like structures on larger scales. Such topology-based 
designs could enable novel mechanical responses in LC polymers and 
elastomers28 and organize nanoparticles into mesoscale spatial pat-
terns29. While chirality is known for stabilizing multi-dimensional soli-
tons, we have shown that chirality can stabilize various co-assemblies 
of topological solitons and vortices, potentially enabling phases of 
matter analogous to twist grain boundary and blue phases in LCs and 
the A-phase in magnets30–37.

Methods
Materials and sample preparation
Chiral LCs were prepared by mixing 4-cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl (5CB; 
EM Chemicals) or a commercially available nematic mixture E7  
(Slichem) with a small amount of a left-handed chiral additive, choles-
terol pelargonate (Sigma-Aldrich). To define the equilibrium pitch (p) 
of the ensuing chiral LCs, the weight fraction of the added chiral dopant 
was calculated using Cdopant = 1/(hhtpp), where the helical twisting power 
hhtp = 6.25 𝜇𝜇m−1 for the cholesterol pelargonate additive. Additionally, 
for high-resolution, aberration-free 3D nonlinear optical imaging, a 
partially polymerizable chiral LC mixture was prepared by mixing 
E7-based chiral LC (69%), reactive mesogens RM-82 and RM-257 (at 
fractions of 12% and 18%, respectively; both from Merck) and 
ultraviolet-sensitive photoinitiator Irgacure 369 (1%; Sigma-Aldrich). 
The sample cells were assembled from indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated 
glass slides or coverslips treated with 25% solution of polyimide SE5661 
(Nissan Chemicals) to obtain strong perpendicular (homeotropic) 
boundary conditions. The polyimide was applied to the substrates by 
spin-coating at 2,700 rpm for 30 s followed by baking (for 5 min at 90 °C 
and then for 1 h at 180 °C). The LC cell gap thickness was defined to be 
10-15 μm by using silica spheres as spacers between two substrates, 
and the ratio between the cell gap and the pitch was d/p = 2.2. Metal 
wires were attached to the ITO and connected to an external voltage 
supply (GFG-8216A; GW Instek) for electric control.
Generating and imaging localized structures in chiral LCs
To generate a möbiuson, we utilized an ytterbium-doped fibre 
laser (YLR-10-1064, IPG Photonics), operating at 1,064 nm. First, we 
laser-generated an extended fibre-like fragment in a uniform unwound 
background under a sinusoidal electric field by using a laser power 
between 30 and 40 mW (Supplementary Video 1). Then, we switched 
off the laser and carefully adjusted the voltage to be around 3.0 V such 
that the fibre-like fragment did not shrink or extend. The two ends of 
the fibre-like fragment then spontaneously curved, forming möbiu-
sons of various orders and symmetries, depending on the length of 
the fibre-like fragment and the spontaneous initial curving directions 
of its ends. High-N structures (N > 20) could be generated from a long 
fibre-like fragment or by adding extra orders to a low-N möbiuson 
(Supplementary Video 3). Torons, hopfions and skyrmion bags were 
also generated by laser tweezers by following procedures as reported 
previously24,34,35.
Bright-field and polarizing optical microscopy images were 
obtained by using a multi-modal imaging setup built around an IX-81 
Olympus inverted microscope (which is also integrated with the 
3PEF-PM imaging setup described below) and charge coupled device 
cameras (Grasshopper and Flea FMVU-13S2C-CS, Point Grey Research 
or Spot 14.2 Color Mosaic, Diagnostic Instruments) with 100×, 40× 
and 20× Olympus objectives with high numerical aperture (NA) of 1.4, 
0.75 and 0.4, respectively. The translational speed, angular velocity 
and trajectories of solitons were analysed by using ImageJ software 
(National Institutes of Health).
Three-dimensional nonlinear optical imaging
The 3D nonlinear optical imaging of möbiuson structures such as 2M 
and 2R was performed using the 3PEF-PM setup built around the IX-81 
Olympus inverted optical microscope integrated with the 
ytterbium-doped fibre laser25. To reduce material birefringence that 
leads to 3PEF-PM imaging artefacts35, before imaging, the möbiusons 
stabilized in the partially polymerizable chiral LC mixture were 
photo-polymerized by weak ultraviolet illumination and the unpolym-
erized LC was washed away and replaced by infiltrating an index- 
matching immersion oil. We used a Ti–sapphire oscillator (Chameleon 
Ultra II; Coherent) operating at 870 nm with 140 fs pulses at a repetition 
rate of 80 MHz as the source of the laser excitation light. An 
oil-immersion 100× objective (NA 1.4) was used to collect the 
fluorescence signal. The fluorescence signal was detected by a photo-
multiplier tube (H5784-20; Hamamatsu) after a 417/60 nm bandpass 
filter. The 3PEF-PM imaging involves a third-order nonlinear process25, 
during which LC molecules are excited via the three-photon absorption 
process and the signal intensity scales as cos6β, where β is the angle 
between the polarization of the excitation light and the long axis (tran-
sition dipole) of the LC molecule. Different polarization states of the 
excitation were controlled by a pair of half-wave and quarter-wave 
retardation plates. The patterns of strong 3PEF-PM intensity obtained 
for a linearly polarized excitation beam reveal the spatial regions where 
cosβ is large, reflecting where n(r) is close to parallel to the polarization 
of the laser beam (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5). On the other hand, the 
laser excitation with circular polarization helps to visualize regions 
with n(r) parallel to glass substrates regardless of their azimuthal 
orientations (Fig. 3g,h). The experimental 3D fluorescence images were 
processed by applying uniform contrast enhancement and 
depth-dependent intensity correction and then compared with their 
numerically simulated counterparts.
Numerical modelling and visualization
We reconstructed the director field configuration of solitons by  
minimizing the Landau–de Gennes free energy of a continuum  
representation of a chiral LC, which reads
F = ∫∫fsurface d2r + ∫∫∫fbulk d3r,
(5)
where the bulk energy density ( fbulk) was integrated over the 3D volume 
occupied by the LC whereas the surface free energy density ( fsurface) 
was integrated over the 2D surfaces at the top and bottom interfaces 
with substrates. The bulk energy density in the Q tensor formalism can 
be written as10,11,38

all indices is assumed. The molecular tensor order parameter is defined 
by Q =

2 (3nn −I ) where S is the scalar order parameter and I is the 
identity matrix. The first three terms in equation (6) correspond to the 
thermotropic energy that describes the nematic–isotropic transition 
of the LC, and minimization of the thermotropic energy yields the 
equilibrium scalar order parameter Seq =
−B+√B2−24AC
6C
. The next five 
terms correspond to the elastic energy that comes from the distortion 
in n(r), including the terms related to molecular chirality. Together, 
the thermotropic and elastic terms reflect the energy penalties associ-
ated with deviating the molecular director away from its equilibrium 
configuration and order. The final two terms describe the dielectric 
coupling between Q and the electric field E. The surface free energy

performed on a 3D grid with a spacing of 33.9 nm in all directions, and 
a typical simulation volume was a cuboid box with 64 × 112 × 50 grid 
points, corresponding to physical dimensions of 2.17 × 3.80 × 1.70 μm3. 
Doubling the grid spacing (to 67.8 nm) on a 128 × 224 × 100 grid 
(8.6 × 15.2 × 6.8 μm3) did not yield qualitative differences in the mini-
mized field configurations. We note that using grid spacings larger 
than ξ leads to an underestimation of the free energy of the defect cores. 
Nevertheless, variations in field configurations at micrometre length 
scales, which are three orders of magnitude larger than ξ and the size 
of the defect core, rather than the system’s behaviour within the cores 
of defect lines, are most relevant to our study of möbiuson structure 
in this work. The excellent agreement between the simulated field 
configurations and their experimental counterparts justifies the used 
rescaling and grid spacing, which allowed for modelling of structures 
containing defects at the expense of nanometre-scale details within 
their cores. Minimizations of extended fragment structures were per-
formed on a grid with 100 × 100 × 100 points and spacing of 10.17 nm. 
To gain insights into the origins of the folding instability, we simulated 
the snake-like fragment of the möbiuson using a computational box 
with 50 × L × 50 grid points, where L is the length of a repeating unit cell 
containing the periodically folded structure to be determined by 
energy minimization. The boundary conditions at the edges of this 
unit cell on planes orthogonal to the y axis in Fig. 2l are periodic. By 
minimizing the field configurations with different L values, we obtained 
the energy-minimizing period L, as well as the equilibrium director 
configuration and other geometric characteristics of the folded  
structure. The numerical results agree well with experimental 
observations.
We simulated POMs by the Jones matrix method using the 
energy-minimizing n(r) of solitons21,38,39. We first spilt the cell into 50 
thin sublayers along the z direction, then the Jones matrix for each pixel 
in each sublayer was calculated by finding the local optical axis and the 
ordinary and extraordinary phase retardation. The optical axis is along 
the local molecular direction, and phase retardation comes from the 
optical anisotropy of the LC, for example, no = 1.58 and ne = 1.77 for 
5CB. The Jones matrix for the whole LC cell was obtained by multiplying 
all the Jones matrices for each sublayer. The simulated single- 
wavelength POM was obtained as the analyser component of the prod-
uct of the Jones matrix and the incident polarization. Coloured POMs 
were then obtained as the combination of single-wavelength POMs 
corresponding to red, green and blue primary colours at wavelengths 
of 650, 550 and 450 nm, respectively, with intensities matching the 
light source in the experiment.
The 3D field configurations of solitons were visualized by the 
isosurfaces of nz, the vertical component of n(r), at |nz| = 0.8, coloured 
according to the orientations of n(r), as well as by the isosurface of 
regions of reduced scalar order parameter (S = 0.45 for fibre-like frag-
ments and S = 0.5 for möbiusons) to visualize singular vortex lines. 
Computer simulations of the 3PEF-PM images were based on the signal 
intensity I3PEF−PM ∝cos6β. In both our experiments and simulations, the 
intensity patterns obtained for different linear polarizations of excita-
tion light were coloured as shown in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5.  
Visualizations were performed in ParaView open-source freeware.

relative to the far-field background. The increased values of free energy density 
in the middle of the twist wall is higher due to the contribution of the dielectric
