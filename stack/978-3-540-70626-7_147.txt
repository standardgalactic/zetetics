POVM (Positive Operator Value Measure)
Roderich Tumulka
POVM: positive-operator-valued measure, also called generalized observable.
A mathematical object, consisting of a family of operators on  Hilbert space,
that occurs in quantum theoretical formulas for the probability distribution of the
random outcome of a quantum mechanical experiment. The concept of POVM
contains, as a special case, that of  observables represented by  self-adjoint
operators.
Overview
Outline of Deﬁnition. The word “measure” in “positive-operator-valued measure” is
understood in the sense of mathematical probability and measure theory [5], where
it means “additive set function”. A set function E(·) is a function whose argument
is a set (rather than a number, or a point in space). Possible arguments are subsets 
of a basic set . Typical relevant examples of  include the real line R, n-space Rn,
or ﬁnite sets. A set function is called additive if for any two disjoint sets 1, 2 it
is true that
E(1 ∪2) = E(1) + E(2).

(The full mathematical deﬁnition, see below, requires slightly more.)

POVM (Positive Operator Value Measure)

P
Examples of measures include probability measures, for which E() is a number
between zero and one, giving the probability that a given random variable assumes
a value in the set . For a POVM, E() is a (bounded) positive operator on a
Hilbert space H . An  operator T is called positive if ⟨φ|T φ⟩⩾0 for all φ ∈H ;
this is also sometimes called positive semi-deﬁnite in the literature; every (bounded)
positive operator is self-adjoint. Finally, it is part of the deﬁnition of a POVM that
it is normalized in the sense that E() = I, where I is the identity operator on
H , Iψ = ψ. In case  is a ﬁnite (or countable) set, E() can be expressed by
singletons:
E() =

ω∈
E({ω}).
(2)
(Below we write E{ω} instead of E({ω}).)
Probabilities from POVMs. From a POVM E(·) on a set  one can create probabil-
ity measures on  in the following way: Given any vector ψ ∈H with ∥ψ∥= 1,
then
Pψ() = ⟨ψ|E()|ψ⟩
(3)
deﬁnes a probability measure Pψ(·) on . To see this, note that ⟨ψ|E()|ψ⟩is a
nonnegative real number since E() is a positive operator, and
Pψ() = ⟨ψ|E()|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|I|ψ⟩= ∥ψ∥2 = 1.
(4)
Physical Role. The physical relevance of POVMs is based on the following main
theorem about POVMs: For every quantum physical experiment E whose possible
outcomes lie in a space , there exists a POVM E(·) on  such that, whenever the
experiment E is carried out on a quantum system with state vector ψ, the random
outcome Z has probability distribution given by
P(Z ∈) = ⟨ψ|E()|ψ⟩.
(5)
Observables. When all operators E() are projection operators ( projection) then
E(·) is also called a PVM or projection-valued measure. The widespread concept of
 observables as represented by self-adjoint operators is contained in the concept of
POVM as the special case of a PVM on  = R. The self-adjoint operator A usually
called the “observable” is obtained from E(·) by setting
A =

R
E(dλ) λ .
(6)
Conversely, given A, the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators provides the
right hand side of this equation, that is, provides the unique PVM E(·) on R that
makes this equation true. Thus, the self-adjoint operator A summarizes the entire
information encoded in the PVM E(·) in just one operator.

POVM (Positive Operator Value Measure)
Examples
Observables as represented by self-adjoint operators correspond to the simplest
cases of quantum experiments, usually connected with “ideal measurements.”
POVMs are necessary for more complex experiments.
Time of Arrival. Send a particle towards a detector and measure the time at which the
detector clicks. As a consequence of the main theorem about POVMs, the statistics
of the random result, depending on the initial wave function of the particle, is given
by a POVM, i.e., is of the form (5). Since this POVM is a “proper POVM”, i.e., not
a PVM, there is no self-adjoint operator summarizing it; in other words, there is no
“time operator”. ( Time in quantum mechanics).
Sequence of Ideal Measurements. Readers familiar with the formalism of ideal
quantum measurement of an observable (self-adjoint operator) A may consider a
sequence of such measurements, ﬁrst one corresponding to A1, then another corre-
sponding to A2, and so on, up to An. Suppose that these measurements are carried
out one immediately after another, so that we can neglect the unitary time evolution
in between. Suppose further that the Ai have purely discrete spectrum. Note that the
operators Ai need not commute with each other, as they are not measured simulta-
neously, but in a speciﬁed order. The sequence of outcomes forms a vector in Rn,
whose distribution is given by a POVM E(·) that can be constructed from the PVMs
Ei(·) associated by (6) with Ai as follows:
E
:
(λ1, . . . , λn)
;
= E1{λ1}1/2 · · · En{λn}1/2En{λn}1/2 · · · E1{λ1}1/2.
(7)
(The powers 1/2 can be omitted as P 1/2 = P for every projection P; however, in the
above form the equation still deﬁnes a POVM E(·) when the Ei(·) are themselves
proper POVMs.)
In case the Ai commute with each other, E(·) is a PVM on Rn. In this sense,
a PVM can represent a family of commuting observables. In particular, the three
position operators Qx, Qy, Qz of non-relativistic quantum mechanics of a single
particle together give rise to the following PVM P(·) = E(·) on R3:
P()ψ(x, y, z) =
<
ψ(x, y, z)
if (x, y, z) ∈,
0
otherwise.
(8)
However, when the Ai do not commute then E(·) is not a PVM but a proper POVM.
To make the setting more general, we can allow that the choice of second observ-
able A2 depends on the outcome of the ﬁrst measurement. To take this into account,
replace Ei{λi} in (7) by Ei,λ1,...,λi−1{λi}.
Position Measurements with Constraints. In some cases, not all square-integrable
functions on R3 are possible as physical wave functions of a single particle, but only
those from a suitable subspace Hphys [2,4]. For example, photon  wave function
are functions  : R3 →C3 obeying the constraint ∇·  = 0. As another example,
Dirac wave functions ψ : R3 →C4 are usually regarded as physical only if they

P
consist exclusively of Fourier components with positive energy, in other words, if
they lie in the positive spectral subspace Hphys of the Dirac Hamiltonian. In this
case, the usual position operators and the associated PVM as in (8) often map phys-
ical state vectors into unphysical ones, and are thus not deﬁned as operators on the
physical Hilbert space Hphys. The problem is solved by replacing the “generalized
position observable” P(·) with ˜P (·) deﬁned by
˜P () := Pphys P() Pphys,
(9)
where Pphys denotes the projection to Hphys. Then ˜P () is an operator on Hphys,
and ˜P (·) is a proper POVM on R3.
Fuzzy Measurements. An ideal detector, when detecting the particle in the region
 ⊆R3, would collapse the wave function ψ(x, y, z) to the function in (8). Real
detectors, however, might, for example, cut off the wave function in an unsharp
way, corresponding to a proper POVM ˜P (·) that arises from the PVM P(·) of (8)
by smearing out (convolving) with a “bump function” f (for example a Gaussian):
˜P () =


d3x

R3 P(d3y) f (y −x).
(10)
The Main Theorem About POVMs
It is not difﬁcult to understand the main theorem; here is a simple argument [3].
Suppose the experiment E begins at time t1 and ends at time t2, and suppose the
quantum state of system and apparatus at time t1 is (t1) = ψ ⊗φ. We make three
assumptions: (1) The time evolution from t1 to t2 is given by a unitary operator U.
(2) The  Born rule, according to which the probability distribution of the conﬁgu-
ration Q at time t2 is given by ⟨(t2)|P(·)|(t2)⟩with P(·) the position PVM as in
(8). (3) The outcome Z is a function f of the conﬁguration Q at time t2. Then, for
 ⊆,
P(Z ∈) = P

Q ∈f −1()

= ⟨(t2)|P(f −1())|(t2)⟩
(11)
= ⟨ψ ⊗φ|U∗P(f −1())U|ψ ⊗φ⟩= ⟨ψ|E()|ψ⟩
(12)
with
E() = ⟨φ|U∗P(f −1())U|φ⟩,
(13)
where the scalar product in (13) is a partial scalar product in the Hilbert space of
the apparatus. It can be shown that (13) deﬁnes a POVM.

Mathematical Aspects
Deﬁnition. The mathematical deﬁnition of POVM contains some details we have
omitted above. The family of sets  for which E() is deﬁned is required to be
a σ-algebra, i.e., closed under the complement operation  → \  and under
forming countable intersections. A POVM E(·) is further supposed to be σ-additive,
i.e., additive for any countable union of pairwise disjoint sets 1, 2, . . . ,
E

(14)
where the series on the right hand side is required to converge weakly, i.e., ⟨ψ|E
(i)ψ⟩converges for every ψ ∈H . (Then it automatically also converges strongly,
i.e.,  E(i)ψ converges for every ψ ∈H .)
Integration. Just as integrals can be deﬁned relative to a probability measure P,

 P(dω) f (ω), one can deﬁne integrals relative to a POVM. Such integrals have
occurred above in (6) and (10). One can deﬁne them by
