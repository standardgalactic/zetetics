Abstract: 
There are two main methods of calculating the thermodynamic properties of water and solutes: mass 
action (including the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equations of state and model) and Gibbs 
free energy minimization (e.g. Leal et al., 2016). However, in certain regions of pressure and 
temperature the HKF model inaccurately predicts the speciation and concentration of solutes (e.g. 
Miron et al., 2019). The Deep Earth Water (DEW) model uses a series of HKF-type equations to 
calculate the properties of water and solute concentrations at high temperatures (373 – 1473 K) and 
pressures (0.1 – 6 GPa) (e.g. Huang and Sverjensky, 2019; Pan et al., 2013; Sverjensky et al., 2014). 
The DEW model is synthesized in an Excel spreadsheet and calculates Gibbs energies of formation, 
equilibrium constants, and standard volume changes for reactions. Here we present an object-oriented 
Python implementation of the DEW model, called DEWPython. Our model expands on DEW by 
increasing model efficiency, streamlining the input process, and incorporating SUPCRT in-line. 
Additionally, our model builds in minerals and aqueous species from the thermodynamic database 
slop16.dat (Boyer, 2019) which would normally be calculated separately. We also present a set of 
reactions relevant to icy ocean world interiors calculated with the DEWPython. The favorability of 
these reactions indicates likely formation of certain organic species under extreme pressures relevant 
to ocean worlds.  
 
1. Introduction 
1.1. The need for improved geochemical frameworks to ocean worlds 
Internal liquid water beneath the ice shells of ocean worlds, including Europa, Enceladus, and Titan 
could be suitable for life (e.g. Mann, 2017). The differing input materials, thermal histories, and 
geophysical properties of these moons (e.g. radius, density) likely results in differing ocean 
compositions (e.g. Vance et al., 2018, Neri et al. 2020). Titan and Europa represent endmember 
ocean worlds with different ocean compositions and physical properties. 
Titan is an icy moon with an organic-rich (containing methane and other hydrocarbons) atmosphere 
and is the only moon in the solar system with any significant atmosphere. The surface temperature is 
94 – 97 K and additionally has a methane-centric cycle, similar to that of water on earth (Jennings et 
al., 2016). Although there are several hypotheses, the exact origin of the atmosphere on Titan is 
uncertain (Owen, 2000). One hypothesis is that the atmosphere on Titan originated from its ocean 
(e.g. Miller et al., 2019). If supported, this hypothesis would have direct implications for the evolution 
of Titan, the current oceanic composition, and the potential habitability of its ocean. A methane-rich 
ocean, for example, would result in a lower freezing temperature compared to a pure water ocean.   
Europa’s ocean similarly has an uncertain history of formation (e.g., Pappalardo, 1999). Based on 
spectroscopic observations, a few main hypotheses exist about the composition of the modern ocean, 
where it could contain hydrated sulfide or sulfate salts, chloride salts, or some combination thereof  
(Dalton et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2016; Ligier et al., 2016; Trumbo et al., 2019). The salt composition 
and concentration could potentially constrain the temperature of Europa’s ocean as well as the 
potential habitability (Johnson et al. 2019, Buffo et al. 2020, Vance et al. 2021).  
Reliable geochemical modelling is necessary to determine which of these hypothesized compositions 
is the most robust. The semi-empirical Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state is in 
broad current use for computing the thermodynamic properties of aqueous complexes and ions at

differing temperatures and pressures. However, HKF provides unphysical results in certain regions of 
pressure-temperature space where it is inaccurate at predicting the properties of water (e.g., density, 
Gibbs energy) due to inadequate experimental data on the dielectric constant of water at high 
temperatures and pressures (Miron et al., 2019). The improvement of this model and the equations of 
state for organic molecules at various pressures and temperatures can help inform about the rates at 
which they form, their mechanisms of formation, and the locations at which they form.   
With planned NASA missions Europa Clipper and Dragonfly to Europa and Titan respectively, the 
accuracy and usability of thermodynamic models need to be improved; better models enable the 
prediction of chemical processes occurring in these worlds and allow preparation for the analysis of 
spacecraft measurements, such as ocean compositions inferred from molecular species possibly 
present in Europa’s exosphere or Titan’s atmosphere. 
 
1.2. Software Background 
Several thermodynamic frameworks calculate thermodynamic properties of aqueous systems at 
extreme ranges of temperature and pressure relevant to icy ocean worlds, with different relative 
merits. We review them here to provide context for the development of DEWPython. 
SUPCRTBL (Zimmer et al., 2016) is a refinement of SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992) which 
calculates the Gibbs energy of formation, volume of formation, and changes in entropy, enthalpy, 
and specific heat for minerals, aqueous species, and reactions. Also pertinent to this work, 
SUPCRT96 is an intermediary between SUPCRT92 and SUPCRTBL that incorporates updated 
equations, however, still produces values in the units of SUPCRT92. These properties are calculated 
either under conditions where the pressure is equivalent the liquid-vapor saturation conditions (for 
our use, 273–623 K, 1–16.2 MPa– i.e. psat), at isobars and isotherms ranging from 273–1273 K and 
0–500 MPa, or at any point within a P-T grid. 
SeaFreeze (Journaux et al., 2020) is a local basis function approach to calculating the properties of 
icy polymorphs Ih, III, V, and VI, at the complete range of conditions that could be found in oceans 
and hydrospheres in our solar system (200 – 400 K, 0 – 2300 MPa). The temperature range of 
SeaFreeze is also extendable past this upper end for the properties of liquid water only. The density 
is calculated in SeaFreeze as a derivative of Gibbs energy with pressure that is accurate in the high 
pressure—temperature (PT) range.  
The Deep Earth Water model (DEW; Huang and Sverjensky, 2019; Pan et al., 2013; Sverjensky, 
2019; Sverjensky et al., 2014) is synthesized in an Excel spreadsheet that similarly calculates Gibbs 
energy of formation, equilibrium constants, and standard volume change for reactions. DEW has an 
extended range of validity and can function under several other equations of state (general validity ~ 
373 – 1473 K, 100 – 6000 MPa). There are several online implementations of DEW, such as in 
ENKI ThermoEngine (Ghiorso and Wolf, 2019) and CHNOSZ (Dick, 2019), however, there is no 
specific one-to-one replication of the original spreadsheet in Python format (ThermoEngine can run 
DEW reactions, but does not have the flexibility of the original model).  
The main goals of this work are to make the outputs from DEW transferrable between programs 
and to speed up calculations of mineral species (normally the properties of each mineral species 
would have to be calculated externally and then input into DEW). The Python implementation 
(Supplementary Text S1) allows for a direct comparison of different thermodynamic calculations and 
a Python-centric evaluation of reactions at extreme temperatures and pressures.  DEWPython

additionally includes minerals and aqueous species from the thermodynamic database slop16.dat 
(Boyer, 2019) typically known as a SUPCRT dataset.  
2. Methods 
We reconstructed DEW as the open-source Python package DEWPython with the goal of 
combining a wide P-T range and the calculation of joint mineral and organic thermodynamic 
properties and aqueous speciation. Table 1 compares the general features of the thermodynamic 
models synthesized into DEWPython. 
Table 1: Features of thermodynamic models compared to DEWPython. 
 
2.1. Code conversion 
The base main code of DEWPython converts the functions from the Deep Earth Water Model’s VBA 
storage into Python functions. This porting was accomplished with the aid of the Vb2Py Python 
module (http://vb2py.sourceforge.net/). These functions were then further rewritten to remove the 
dependency on Vb2Py. An internal inconsistency in the representation of the constant “G” was 
corrected in DEWPython. Converted functions were tested directly against their Excel counterparts. 
To reconstruct the interface for DEW (see Supplementary Text S1), input/validation loops were 
utilized and combined into the “set_inputs()” and “set_outputs()” methods of the DEWModel class. 
The custom sheets for water density, dielectric constant, and water free energy were integrated using 
the comma separated value format using the “import_custom_sheets()” method. To mimic the 
“input” sheet of DEW, functions “set_TPRho() and set_preferences()” were coded using a similar 
interactive input/validation loop. 
The embedded dictionaries for aqueous species and gaseous species were created utilizing the pandas 
package to upload the DEW spreadsheet and store every species in text files. To create the embedded 
mineral dictionary, every mineral in the slop16 thermodynamic data file (Boyer, 2019) was run through 
SUPCRT96 under psat conditions. The lower limit on temperature was set at 25 °C as the psat pressure 
does not change until above 100 °C. Additionally, SUPCRT96 was used instead of SUPCRTBL due 
to the unique ability to handle the slop16 data file. These SUPCRT output txt files were manually 
combined using a custom file input code and created as a nested dictionary of thermodynamic 
properties for each mineral species available.

The equations for each cell are handled in the “calculate_aq()”, “calculate_gas()”, and 
“calculate_H2O()”. The individual calculations for DEW were handled with numpy arrays substituting 
the Excel sheet columns, and the equations are directly substituted from the spreadsheet, pulling the 
values that would be on the “Reaction Information” spreadsheet directly from the embedded 
dictionaries. Each of the calculate functions was written to update input and output arrays for aqueous, 
gaseous, and water inputs/outputs. The “calculate()” function runs each these submethods and 
combines the values into single arrays of “delG”, “logK”, and “delV”/  If mineral inputs/outputs are 
being used, their values will be queried from the dictionary during the “calculate()” function and 
subsequently combined with these arrays as well. 
Plots from the Excel spreadsheet’s “Results” sheet were replicated using the “make_plots()” method. 
This method uses sets and default dictionaries to sort the pressure and temperature lists and create 
tuples of pressure and temperature combinations to properly separate the plots by temperature and 
pressure increments.  
SUPCRTBL was implemented in the function using the subprocess module of Python. The 
“outLoop()” function contains and prints the output of SUPCRTBL that would otherwise be in the 
command line. The “run_supcrt()” method utilizes “subprocess.Popen()” and a “while” loop to 
interactively take input and to end when the text file from SUPCRTBL is produced. Note, this method 
requires the user to save reactions in the “.rxn” file format.  
The last two methods implemented were the “calculate_supcrt()” and the “calculate_supcrt_special()” 
methods. The former will calculate the outputs from a psat SUPCRT96 or SUPCRTBL file and store 
it as a nested dictionary of reactions. The latter method performs the same calculations and storage. 
However, this method performs the calculations for files calculated at isotherms and isobars beyond 
psat temperatures. The “make_supcrt_plots()” method creates the same plots as DEW for pre-input 
SUPCRTBL or supcrt96 fields. This method currently only handles the plots for the psat conditions.   
The code for DEWPython was uploaded and published on Github with the inclusion of additional 
__init__, manifest, license, and setup files. This package was then uploaded to the Python Package 
Index (PyPI) utilizing the sdist/bdist_wheel Python functions and the twine utility. Documentation 
for the DEWPython package was created using the pdoc3 package (https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) 
and was provided through Github pages.   
We validated the model through direct comparisons the model through direct comparisons of 
reactions and species to the values output by the DEW spreadsheet. Following the validation of the 
model, the heretofore mentioned reactions were run in Jupyter notebooks. The same reactions were 
run in SUPCRT96 and integrated into a DEW() object through the “calculate_supcrt()” method. The 
comparison plots were created through 3D plotting in matplotlib allowing simple and direct 
comparisons between DEW and supcrt. An example of the validation between the DEW spreadsheet 
and DEWPython is shown in Supplementary Figures S1 – S2. The SeaFreeze values were calculated 
separately implementing SeaFreeze at the same pressures and temperatures as a pure reaction of a 
single water molecule. 
The integrated SUPCRT96 in the DEWPython package was used to run the suite of reactions at a PT 
range of 673 – 1473 K (the upper range of DEW) and 100 – 500 MPa (the upper range of SUPCRT96).

2.2. Model validation and reactions relevant to icy ocean worlds 
We modeled a number of reactions with key significance to Europa and Titan in order to compare 
the differences between the output of each thermodynamic model incorporated into DEWPython, 
and to investigate their relevance in the oceans of Europa and Titan. Specifically, we investigated the 
stabilities of methanol, methane and ethane, and calcite. The Cassini mission determined that there 
is both ethane and methane in Titan’s atmosphere (e.g. Griffith et al., 2006). The stability of these 
substances in the ocean could either validate or rule it out as a possible source of atmospheric 
methane/ethane, as opposed to photochemical or meteoritically delivered. Methanol potentially acts 
as an antifreeze in Titan’s ocean (Dougherty et al., 2018). Calcite is a carbon sink on Earth and a key 
component of some living organisms; the presence and stability of carbonate minerals  in icy ocean 
worlds could be indicative of its availability to possible organisms, as well as the redox state of 
carbon (Glein and Waite, 2020). 
We additionally modeled the stability of acetic acid and pyruvate, which are listed in the 
Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figures S3 – S9). These two compounds are also relevant to 
prebiotic chemistry (e.g. Barge et al., 2020, 2019). 
3. Results and Discussion 
In our comparison of DEWPython to SeaFreeze, DEW, and SUPCRT96, we find that generally 
DEWPython is consistent with these models. Specifically DEWPython produces identical results as 
DEW, results within 1% of SUPCRT when the same source for aqueous/gaseous species is used, and 
within 3% of SeaFreeze at valid ranges. As such, DEWPython can accurately predict properties of 
aqueous species under conditions of elevated pressure and temperature occurring in icy ocean worlds.  
3.1. Comparison of water properties between DEW and SeaFreeze 
The density of water calculated by SeaFreeze and that calculated by DEWPython (𝜌 SeaFreeze – 𝜌 
DEWPython) agree within a difference of ~ 2 % (Figure 1). At lower temperatures and pressures this 
difference is less than 1 %, however, at the temperature and pressure extremes (~6000 MPa, 1300 K) 
calculated in this study the differences reach slightly over 2%. DEWPython is inaccurate at low 
temperatures and high pressures (>3000 MPa, 373-573 K) as this region falls in the range of ice VII 
which is not accounted for in the model.  
The difference in the Gibbs free energy of the formation of water (ΔGf SeaFreeze – ΔGf DEWPython; 
Figure 2) tends to increase between DEWPython and SeaFreeze with increasing temperature. 
SeaFreeze calculates nearly identical values for water density as the Deep Earth Water model (DEW) 
does. However, the two differ slightly at high pressures and temperatures, as expected from the 
parameterization of DEW using the Zhang and Duan (2005) equation for the density of water 
(SeaFreeze “water2” uses the Brown 2018 equation of state which uses local basis functions). At high 
pressures and temperatures, the Zhang and Duan equation of state becomes less reliable and is only 
valid up to the 1473 K limit. Given that the Gibbs free energy derives directly from water density in 
DEW, calculated Gibbs free energy exhibits similar behavior. The implication of this result is that 
DEW may not actually need to be re-evaluated in context of differing Gibbs of water values for 
DEW’s range of validity.

3.2. Comparison between DEW and SUPCRT reactions 
A. Methanol 
The stability of methanol (CH3OH) is strongly dependent on the specific reaction pathway and the 
aqueous reactants and products. We focus on the dissociation of methanol into the methyl and 
hydroxyl radicals (CH3OH(aq) ⇌ CH3(aq) + OH(aq)) in the wide pressure-temperature (PT) space 
enabled by SUPCRT and DEW, and show other possible methanol formation and dissociation 
pathways in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figure S10). Figure 3 shows the equilibrium 
constant (in standard log10 mol units) for the dissociation reaction in the available PT space. Methanol 
is relatively stable compared to its dissociation products, particularly in the high temperature, low 
pressure regime. Comparing the stability of the reaction across different bodies by overlaying the 
geotherms of Titan, Europa and Ceres obtained from the literature, methanol appears to be most 
stable within the interior of Ceres, becoming more stable with increasing depth. The “warm” Europa 
geotherm is most conducive to the dissociation of methanol, but even in that case, methanol is still 
more stable relative to its dissociation products. Should methanol be present in the interiors or oceans 
of these bodies, it appears likely that it would not dissociate unless other reactants would cause it to 
do so (e.g. oxidants). 
In the overlapping PT regions between SUPCRT and DEW, calculated log Ks differ somewhat 
between the models, particularly at higher pressures and temperatures. For example, following the 
geotherm for Ceres, SUPCRT yields log K <-5 at the highest pressure within Ceres, whereas DEW 
yields log K >-4.

B. Ethane and methane 
As discussed, Titan’s atmosphere contains both ethane and methane. Here we explore the stability of 
ethane in water C2H6 + H2 ⇌ 2CH4; other reaction pathways and extended calculations are shown in 
Supplementary Figures S11 – S13. The formation of methane from ethane and hydrogen is favorable 
under pressure and temperature conditions relevant to Titan’s and Europa’s oceans (Fig. 4), suggesting 
that ethane formation in their oceans through this pathway is inhibited. The reaction only becomes 
unfavorable in the deeper interiors, i.e., in the silicate mantles of Europa and Titan. If ethane converts 
to methane in Titan’s ocean, it would imply that the ethane discovered by Cassini in Titan’s 
atmosphere would have originated from photochemistry in the atmosphere, surface or ice shell, or 
have an external source. Ethane additionally could be produced by surface lakes or directly in the 
atmosphere utilizing a cyclical process where evaporation or volcanic action release methane that 
converts to ethane. Minor organic solutes C2H6, CH4 and N2 evaporate to CH4 in the atmosphere. 
This would combine with N2 to form complex organics/will also form C2H6 in the atmosphere, which 
precipitate back into the lake through aerosol sedimentation (Raulin, 2008). Alternatively, ethane 
production from methane could occur within the silicate interior of Titan, although Titan’s interior is 
unlikely to be hydrated (e.g. Monteux et al., 2018).

C. Aqueous calcium carbonate 
Aqueous calcium carbonate formation from its constituent ions (Ca+2 + CO32- ⇌ CaCO3) is favorable 
throughout the P-T space encompassed by SUPCRT and DEW, but is highest at the low pressure-
high temperature regime, and high pressure-low temperature regime (Fig. 5). The formation of 
aqueous calcite is most favorable in the deep interior of Ceres (log K > 8; Fig. 5).  
This result indicates that the formation of calcium carbonate is potentially an effective carbon sink in 
icy ocean worlds: once formed, carbon stored as calcite would not be easily soluble in icy ocean worlds 
(similar to its behavior on Earth e.g., Broecker & Takahashi, 1977). It is also important to note that 
the log K values calculated by SUPCRT and DEW diverge at high temperature values (Fig. 5). This 
difference partially results from the different equations; however, the bulk of the difference likely 
arises from a difference in the source of thermodynamic data. Specifically, DEW uses aqueous calcium 
carbonate data from Facq et al. (2014) and the slop16 thermodynamic file uses calcium carbonate data 
from Sverjensky et al. (1997) (and generally contains aqueous species data from several different 
sources).

4. Conclusion and Future Directions 
We have created new functionality for the Deep Earth Water Model by implementing it in the Python 
package DEWPython. DEWPython comprises a replication of the DEW spreadsheet in the Python 
programming language that operates functionally similar, but additionally builds in a dictionary of 
minerals/aqueous species under psat conditions, produces high-resolution datasets without the 
runtime limitations of Excel, fixes coded errors in DEW, and integrates SUPCRTBL inline. We’ve 
also provided the options to optimize/expedite running reactions in DEW. Furthermore, 
DEWPython features an interactive user interface and extensive documentation that allow the user to 
determine exactly where the outputs come from instead of feeding through a black box of Visual Basic 
integrated macros.  
Generally, the results from SUPCRT are consistent with the DEW results in the PT regions where 
they overlap. However, in several cases (e.g., the dissolution of aqueous calcium carbonate and the 
dissolution of methanol; Figs. 3 and 5) the results for ΔG and log K differ at high pressures and 
temperatures.  
The discrepancies in specific reactions between SUPCRT and DEW could originate from different 
data sources for specific aqueous organic species in the former. Given the composition of the 
SUPCRT slop16 (a sequential access database containing thermodynamic data for organic, ionic, and 
mineral species) from multiple sources (e.g., Canovas and Shock, 2016, which is not contained in 
DEW), it is plausible that internal inconsistencies exist within the database that cause different end 
behaviors under psat conditions. Similarly, because DEW obtains some species’ thermodynamic data 
from different sources than SUPCRT models, it is highly plausible they will eventually encounter 
differences for these species.1 Additionally, there is a slight (< 0.08 MPa) difference in the manner in 
which pressures are calculated in the psat for both DEW and for SUPCRT which results from a 
difference in equations used between the two programs. Species with a greater pressure dependence 
could cause a difference in the end result as well. 
The Python integration of DEW provides a robust method to determine the possible organic species 
that occur in the oceans of icy worlds. The favorability of organic species can then be combined with 
data from the upcoming Europa Clipper or Dragonfly missions to validate and refine the model 
assumptions for all icy ocean worlds. We find that the different temperature profiles of different ocean 
worlds shift the stability of the chemical reactions tested here and yield markedly different amounts 
of minerals and products (§3.2). For example, for a fixed concentration of dissolved calcium and 
carbonate ions, the production of calcite is about four orders of magnitude higher within Ceres than 
within Europa at a fixed temperature, and at least three orders of magnitude higher within Titan than 
within Europa (Fig. 5). In addition, the source of ethane in Titan’s atmosphere and lakes is unlikely to 
be the dissolved methane in Titan’s ocean, since ethane appears to be unstable relative to methane 
under the relevant temperature and pressure conditions (Fig. 4). Finally, methanol is 
thermodynamically stable relative to its dissociation products in Titan’s and Europa’s oceans, 
signifying that it may be present in the oceans, where it could lower the liquidus temperature of water, 
in line with experimental predictions from Dougherty et al. (2018). 
However, there is still room for refinement of DEWPython and extension of its applications. The 
first main addition to DEWPython will be the addition of more organic species to the aqueous species 
text file. A first step here is the inclusion of the organic species outlined in Shock, 2016 for the 
 
1 Full lists of sources for both DEW and SUPCRT are available in the DEW 2019 model and slop16 file respectively.

evaluation of reactions present in the citric acid cycle. DEWPython could also be used in conjunction 
with FREZCHEM (Marion et al., 2010) to further model reactions at lower temperatures. 
An extension of these added organic molecules could convolve the use of DEW to evaluate the 
thermodynamic favorability of reactions relating to different chondrite compositions. A simplified 
version of DEW is implemented in the Gibbs energy minimization code Perple_X (Connolly, 2017, 
2009; Connolly and Galvez, 2018), but it does not include the database extensions we have added 
here. Adding the thermodynamic database solutes, organics and minerals to such a code would be a 
useful endeavor. 
Further refinement of the DEWPython package will also be helpful. There are specifically several 
refinements on the documentation/organization side of DEWPython that will make the package more 
user-friendly, such as the implementation of a graphic user interface, or standardization of variable 
names/printouts of variable names.  
Having the values for the change in free energy provides a robust ground truth that could potentially 
provide the basis for a neural network. Therefore, another potential application of DEWPython is for 
the machine learning (ML) analysis of the free energy values of these reactions to the known species 
compositions.
