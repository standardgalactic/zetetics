Preface
This book is intended as a combination of a reference book for those who work
with cavitation or bubble dynamics and as a monograph for advanced students
interested in some of the basic problems associated with this category of multi-
phase ﬂows. A book like this has many roots. It began many years ago when,
as a young postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, I was
asked to prepare a series of lectures on cavitation for a graduate course cum sem-
inar series. It was truly a baptism by ﬁre, for the audience included three of the
great names in cavitation research, Milton Plesset, Allan Acosta, and Theodore
Wu, none of whom readily accepted superﬁcial explanations. For that, I am
immensely grateful. The course and I survived, and it evolved into one part of
a graduate program in multiphase ﬂows.
There are many people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for the roles they
played in making this book possible.
It was my great good fortune to have
known and studied with six outstanding scholars, Les Woods, George Gadd,
Milton Plesset, Allan Acosta, Ted Wu, and Rolf Sabersky.
I beneﬁted im-
mensely from their scholarship and their friendship. I also owe much to my
many colleagues in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers whose in-
sights ﬁll many of the pages of this monograph. The support of my research
program by the Oﬃce of Naval Research is also greatly appreciated. And, of
course, I feel honored to have worked with an outstanding group of graduate
students at Caltech, including Sheung-Lip Ng, Kiam Oey, David Braisted, Luca
d’Agostino, Steven Ceccio, Sanjay Kumar, Douglas Hart, Yan Kuhn de Chizelle,
Beth McKenney, Zhenhuan Liu, Yi-Chun Wang, and Garrett Reisman, all of
whom studied aspects of cavitating ﬂows.
The book is dedicated to Doreen, my companion and friend of over thirty
years, who tolerated the obsession and the late nights that seemed necessary to
bring it to completion. To her I owe more than I can tell.

UNITS
In most of this book, the emphasis is placed on the nondimensional parameters
that govern the phenomenon being discussed. However, there are also circum-
stances in which we shall utilize dimensional thermodynamic and transport
properties. In such cases the International System of Units will be employed
using the basic units of mass (kg), length (m), time (s), and absolute temper-
ature (K); where it is particularly convenient units such as a joule (kg m2/s2)
will occasionally be used.

Chapter 1
PHASE CHANGE,
NUCLEATION, AND
CAVITATION
1.1
INTRODUCTION
This ﬁrst chapter will focus on the mechanisms of formation of two-phase mix-
tures of vapor and liquid. Particular attention will be given to the process of the
creation of vapor bubbles in a liquid. In doing so we will attempt to meld to-
gether several overlapping areas of research activity. First, there are the studies
of the fundamental physics of nucleation as epitomized by the books of Frenkel
(1955) and Skripov (1974). These deal largely with very pure liquids and clean
environments in order to isolate the behavior of pure liquids.
On the other
hand, most engineering systems are impure or contaminated in ways that have
important eﬀects on the process of nucleation. The later part of the chapter
will deal with the physics of nucleation in such engineering environments. This
engineering knowledge tends to be divided into two somewhat separate ﬁelds of
interest, cavitation and boiling. A rough but useful way of distinguishing these
two processes is to deﬁne cavitation as the process of nucleation in a liquid
when the pressure falls below the vapor pressure, while boiling is the process
of nucleation that ocurs when the temperature is raised above the saturated
vapor/liquid temperature. Of course, from a basic physical point of view, there
is little diﬀerence between the two processes, and we shall attempt to review the
two processes of nucleation simultaneously. The diﬀerences in the two processes
occur because of the diﬀerent complicating factors that occur in a cavitating
ﬂow on the one hand and in the temperature gradients and wall eﬀects that
occur in boiling on the other hand. The last sections of this ﬁrst chapter will
dwell on some of these complicating factors.

1.2
THE LIQUID STATE
Any discussion of the process of phase change from liquid to gas or vice versa
must necessarily be preceded by a discussion of the liquid state. Though simple
kinetic theory understanding of the gaseous state is suﬃcient for our purposes, it
is necessary to dwell somewhat longer on the nature of the liquid state. In doing
so we shall follow Frenkel (1955), though it should also be noted that modern
studies are usually couched in terms of statistical mechanics (for example, Carey
1992).
Our discussion will begin with typical phase diagrams, which, though ideal-
ized, are relevant to many practical substances. Figure 1.1 shows typical graphs
of pressure, p, temperature, T, and speciﬁc volume, V , in which the state of the
substance is indicated. The triple point is that point in the phase diagram at
which the solid, liquid, and vapor states coexist; that is to say the substance
has three alternative stable states. The saturated liquid/vapor line (or binodal)
extends from this point to the critical point. Thermodynamically it is deﬁned by
the fact that the chemical potentials of the two coexisting phases must be equal.
On this line the vapor and liquid states represent two limiting forms of a single
“amorphous” state, one of which can be obtained from the other by isother-
mal volumetric changes, leading through intermediate but unstable states. To
quote Frenkel (1955), “Owing to this instability, the actual transition from the
liquid state to the gaseous one and vice versa takes place not along a theoretical
isotherm (dashed line, right, Figure 1.1), but along a horizontal isotherm (solid
line), corresponding to the splitting up of the original homogeneous substance
into two diﬀerent coexisting phases...” The critical point is that point at which
the maxima and minima in the theoretical isotherm vanish and the discontinuity
disappears.

The line joining the maxima in the theoretical isotherms is called the vapor
spinodal line; the line joining the minima is called the liquid spinodal line Clearly
both spinodals end at the critical point. The two regions between the spinodal
lines and the saturated (or binodal) lines are of particular interest because the
conditions represented by the theoretical isotherm within these regions can be
realized in practice under certain special conditions. If, for example, a pure
liquid at the state A (Figure 1.1) is depressurized at constant temperature, then
several things may happen when the pressure is reduced below that of point
B (the saturated vapor pressure). If suﬃcient numbers of nucleation sites of
suﬃcient size are present (and this needs further discussion later) the liquid will
become vapor as the state moves horizontally from B to C, and at pressure below
the vapor pressure the state will come to equilibrium in the gaseous region at a
point such as E. However, if no nucleation sites are present, the depressurization
may lead to continuation of the state down the theoretical isotherm to a point
such as D, called a “metastable state” since imperfections may lead to instability
and transition to the point E. A liquid at a point such as D is said to be in
tension, the pressure diﬀerence between B and D being the magnitude of the
tension.
Of course one could also reach a point like D by proceeding along
an isobar from a point such as D′ by increasing the temperature.
Then an
equivalent description of the state at D is to call it superheated and to refer to
the diﬀerence between the temperatures at D and D′ as the superheat.
In an analogous way one can visualize cooling or pressurizing a vapor that
is initially at a state such as F and proceeding to a metastable state such as F′
where the temperature diﬀerence between F and F′ is the degree of subcooling
of the vapor.
1.3
FLUIDITY AND ELASTICITY
Before proceding with more detail, it is valuable to point out several qualitative
features of the liquid state and to remark on its comparison with the simpler
crystalline solid or gaseous states.
The ﬁrst and most obvious diﬀerence between the saturated liquid and sat-
urated vapor states is that the density of the liquid remains relatively constant
and similar to that of the solid except close to the critical point. On the other
hand the density of the vapor is diﬀerent by at least 2 and up to 5 or more
orders of magnitude, changing radically with temperature. Since it will also be
important in later discussions, a plot of the ratio of the saturated liquid density
to the saturated vapor density is included as Figure 1.2 for a number of diﬀerent
ﬂuids. The ratio is plotted against a non-dimensional temperature, θ = T/TC
where T is the actual temperature and TC is the critical temperature.
Second, an examination of the measured speciﬁc heat of the saturated liquid
reveals that this is of the same order as the speciﬁc heat of the solid except at
high temperature close to the critical point. The above two features of liquids
imply that the thermal motion of the liquid molecules is similar to that of the
solid and involves small amplitude vibrations about a quasi-equilibrium position

function of temperature for various pure substances.
within the liquid. Thus the arrangement of the molecules has greater similarity
with a solid than with a gas. One needs to stress this similarity with a solid to
counteract the tendency to think of the liquid state as more akin to the gaseous
state than to the solid state because in many observed processes it possesses a
dominant ﬂuidity rather than a dominant elasticity. Indeed, it is of interest in
this regard to point out that solids also possess ﬂuidity in addition to elasticity.
At high temperatures, particularly above 0.6 or 0.7 of the melting temperature,
most crystalline solids exhibit a ﬂuidity known as creep. When the strain rate is
high, this creep occurs due to the nonisotropic propagation of dislocations (this
behavior is not like that of a Newtonian liquid and cannot be characterized
by a simple viscosity). At low strain rates, high-temperature creep occurs due
simply to the isotropic migration of molecules within the crystal lattice due to
the thermal agitation. This kind of creep, which is known as diﬀusion creep, is
analogous to the ﬂuidity observed in most liquids and can be characterized by

a simple Newtonian viscosity.
Following this we may ask whether the liquid state possesses an elasticity
even though such elasticity may be dominated by the ﬂuidity of the liquid in
many physical processes. In both the liquid and solid states one might envisage
a certain typical time, tm, for the migration of a molecule from one position
within the structure of the substance to a neighboring position; alternatively
one might consider this typical time as characterizing the migration of a “hole”
or vacancy from one position to another within the structure.
Then if the
typical time, t, associated with the applied force is small compared with tm, the
substance will not be capable of permanent deformation during that process
and will exhibit elasticity rather than ﬂuidity. On the other hand if t ≫tm the
material will exhibit ﬂuidity. Thus, though the conclusion is overly simplistic,
one can characterize a solid as having a large tm and a liquid as having a small
tm relative to the order of magnitude of the typical time, t, of the applied
force. One example of this is that the earth’s mantle behaves to all intents and
purposes as solid rock in so far as the propagation of seismic waves is concerned,
and yet its ﬂuid-like ﬂow over long geological times is responsible for continental
drift.
The observation time, t, becomes important when the phenomenon is con-
trolled by stochastic events such as the diﬀusion of vacancies in diﬀusion creep.
In many cases the process of nucleation is also controlled by such stochastic
events, so the observation time will play a signiﬁcant role in determining this
process. Over a longer period of time there is a greater probability that vacan-
cies will coalesce to form a ﬁnite vapor pocket leading to nucleation. Conversely,
it is also possible to visualize that a liquid could be placed in a state of tension
(negative pressure) for a signiﬁcant period of time before a vapor bubble would
form in it. Such a scenario was visualized many years ago. In 1850, Berthelot
(1850) subjected puriﬁed water to tensions of up to 50 atmospheres before it
yielded. This ability of liquids to withstand tension is very similar to the more
familiar property exhibited by solids and is a manifestation of the elasticity of
a liquid.
1.4
ILLUSTRATION OF
TENSILE STRENGTH
Frenkel (1955) illustrates the potential tensile strength of a pure liquid by means
of a simple, but instructive calculation. Consider two molecules separated by
a variable distance s.
The typical potential energy, Φ, associated with the
intermolecular forces has the form shown in Figure 1.3. Equilibrium occurs at
the separation, xo, typically of the order of 10−10m. The attractive force, F ,
between the molecules is equal to ∂Φ/∂x and is a maximum at some distance,
x1, where typically x1/xo is of the order of 1.1 or 1.2. In a bulk liquid or solid
this would correspond to a fractional volumetric expansion, ∆V/Vo, of about
one-third. Consequently the application of a constant tensile stress equal to that

Figure 1.3: Intermolecular potential.
pertinent at x1 would completely rupture the liquid or solid since for x > x1 the
attractive force is insuﬃcient to counteract that tensile force. In fact, liquids
and solids have compressibility moduli, κ, which are usually in the range of 1010
to 1011 kg/m s2 and since the pressure, p = −κ(∆V/Vo), it follows that the
typical pressure that will rupture a liquid, pT , is −3×109 to −3×1010 kg/m s2.
In other words, we estimate on this basis that liquids or solids should be able to
withstand tensile stresses of 3 × 104 to 3 × 105 atmospheres! In practice solids
do not reach these limits (the rupture stress is usually about 100 times less)
because of stress concentrations; that is to say, the actual stress encountered at
certain points can achieve the large values quoted above at certain points even
when the overall or globally averaged stress is still 100 times smaller. In liquids
the large theoretical values of the tensile strength defy all practical experience;
this discrepancy must be addressed.
It is valuable to continue the above calculation one further step (Frenkel
1955). The elastic energy stored per unit volume of the above system is given
by κ(∆V )2/2Vo or |p|∆Vo/2. Consequently the energy that one must provide
to pull apart all the molecules and vaporize the liquid can be estimated to be
given by |pT |/6 or between 5 × 108 and 5 × 109 kg/m s2. This is in agreement
with the order of magnitude of the latent heat of vaporization measured for
many liquids.
Moreover, one can correctly estimate the order of magnitude
of the critical temperature, TC, by assuming that, at that point, the kinetic
energy of heat motion, kTC per molecule (where k is Boltzmann’s constant,
1.38×10−23 kg m2/s2K) is equal to the energy required to pull all the molecules
apart. Taking a typical 1030 molecules per m3, this implies that TC is given
by equating the kinetic energy of the thermal motions per unit volume, or
1.38 × 107 × TC, to |pT|/6. This yields typical values of TC of the order of
30 →300◦K, which is in accord with the order of magnitude of the actual
values.
Consequently we ﬁnd that this simplistic model presents a dilemma

because though it correctly predicts the order of magnitude of the latent heat
of vaporization and the critical temperature, it fails dismally to predict the
tensile strength that a liquid can withstand. One must conclude that unlike
the latent heat and critical temperature, the tensile strength is determined by
weaknesses at points within the liquid. Such weaknesses are probably ephemeral
and diﬃcult to quantify, since they could be caused by minute impurities. This
diﬃculty and the dependence on the time of application of the tension greatly
complicate any theoretical evaluation of the tensile strength.
1.5
CAVITATION AND BOILING
As we discussed in Section 1.2, the tensile strength of a liquid can be manifest
in at least two ways:
1. A liquid at constant temperature could be subjected to a decreasing pres-
sure, p, which falls below the saturated vapor pressure, pV . The value of
(pV −p) is called the tension, ∆p, and the magnitude at which rupture
occurs is the tensile strength of the liquid, ∆pC. The process of rupturing
a liquid by decrease in pressure at roughly constant liquid temperature is
often called cavitation.
2. A liquid at constant pressure may be subjected to a temperature, T, in
excess of the normal saturation temperature, TS. The value of ∆T = T −
TS is the superheat, and the point at which vapor is formed, ∆TC, is called
the critical superheat. The process of rupturing a liquid by increasing the
temperature at roughly constant pressure is often called boiling.
Though the basic mechanics of cavitation and boiling must clearly be similar, it
is important to diﬀerentiate between the thermodynamic paths that precede the
formation of vapor. There are diﬀerences in the practical manifestations of the
two paths because, although it is fairly easy to cause uniform changes in pressure
in a body of liquid, it is very diﬃcult to uniformly change the temperature. Note
that the critical values of the tension and superheat may be related when the
magnitudes of these quantities are small. By the Clausius-Clapeyron relation,

where ρL, ρV are the saturated liquid and vapor densities and L is the latent
heat of evaporation. Except close to the critical point, we have ρL ≫ρV and
hence dp/dT ≈ρV L/T. Therefore
∆TC ≈∆pC ·

(1.2)
For example, in water at 373K with ρV = 1 kg/m3 and L ≈2 × 106 m2/s2 a
superheat of 20K corresponds approximately to one atmosphere of tension. It

is important to emphasize that Equation (1.2) is limited to small values of the
tension and superheat but provides a useful relation under those circumstances.
When ∆pC and ∆TC are larger, it is necessary to use an appropriate equation
of state for the substance in order to establish a numerical relationship.
1.6
TYPES OF NUCLEATION
In any practical experiment or application weaknesses can typically occur in two
forms. The thermal motions within the liquid form temporary, microscopic voids
that can constitute the nuclei necessary for rupture and growth to macroscopic
bubbles. This is termed homogeneous nucleation. In practical engineering sit-
uations it is much commoner to ﬁnd that the major weaknesses occur at the
boundary between the liquid and the solid wall of the container or between the
liquid and small particles suspended in the liquid. When rupture occurs at such
sites, it is termed heterogeneous nucleation.
In the following sections we brieﬂy review the theory of homogeneous nu-
cleation and some of the experimental results conducted in very clean systems
that can be compared with the theory.
In covering the subject of homogeneous nucleation, it is important to re-
member that the classical treatment using the kinetic theory of liquids allows
only weaknesses of one type: the ephemeral voids that happen to occur be-
cause of the thermal motions of the molecules. In any real system several other
types of weakness are possible. First, it is possible that nucleation might occur
at the junction of the liquid and a solid boundary. Kinetic theories have also
been developed to cover such heterogeneous nucleation and allow evaluation of
whether the chance that this will occur is larger or smaller than the chance of
homogeneous nucleation. It is important to remember that heterogeneous nucle-
ation could also occur on very small, sub-micron sized contaminant particles in
the liquid; experimentally this would be hard to distinguish from homogeneous
nucleation.
Another important form of weaknesses are micron-sized bubbles (microbub-
bles) of contaminant gas, which could be present in crevices within the solid
boundary or within suspended particles or could simply be freely suspended
within the liquid. In water, microbubbles of air seem to persist almost indeﬁ-
nitely and are almost impossible to remove completely. As we discuss later, they
seem to resist being dissolved completely, perhaps because of contamination of
the interface. While it may be possible to remove most of these nuclei from
a small research laboratory sample, their presence dominates most engineering
applications. In liquids other than water, the kinds of contamination which can
occur in practice have not received the same attention.
Another important form of contamination is cosmic radiation. A collision
between a high energy particle and a molecule of the liquid can deposit suﬃcient
energy to initiate nucleation when it would otherwise have little chance of oc-
curring. Such, of course, is the principal of the bubble chamber (Skripov 1974).
While this subject is beyond the scope of this text, it is important to bear in

mind that naturally occurring cosmic radiation could be a factor in promoting
nucleation in all of the circumstances considered here.
1.7
HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION
THEORY
Studies of the fundamental physics of the formation of vapor voids in the body
of a pure liquid date back to the pioneering work of Gibbs (Gibbs 1961). The
modern theory of homogeneous nucleation is due to Volmer and Weber (1926),
Farkas (1927), Becker and Doring (1935), Zeldovich (1943), and others.
For
reviews of the subject, the reader is referred to the books of Frenkel (1955)
and Skripov (1974), to the recent text by Carey (1992) and to the reviews
by Blake (1949), Bernath (1952), Cole (1970), Blander and Katz (1975), and
Lienhard and Karimi (1981). We present here a brief and simpliﬁed version of
homogeneous nucleation theory, omitting many of the detailed thermodynamical
issues; for more detail the reader is referred to the above literature.
In a pure liquid, surface tension is the macroscopic manifestation of the
intermolecular forces that tend to hold molecules together and prevent the for-
mation of large holes. The liquid pressure, p, exterior to a bubble of radius R,
will be related to the interior pressure, pB, by
pB −p = 2S
R
(1.3)
where S is the surface tension. In this and the section which follow it is assumed
that the concept of surface tension (or, rather, surface energy) can be extended
down to bubbles or vacancies a few intermolecular distances in size. Such an
approximation is surprisingly accurate (Skripov 1974).
If the temperature, T, is uniform and the bubble contains only vapor, then
the interior pressure pB will be the saturated vapor pressure pV (T). However,
the exterior liquid pressure, p = pV −2S/R, will have to be less than pV in order
to produce equilibrium conditions. Consequently if the exterior liquid pressure
is maintained at a constant value just slightly less than pV −2S/R, the bubble
will grow, R will increase, the excess pressure causing growth will increase, and
rupture will occur. It follows that if the maximum size of vacancy present is
RC (termed the critical radius or cluster radius), then the tensile strength of
the liquid, ∆pC, will be given by
∆pC = 2S/RC
(1.4)
In the case of ephemeral vacancies such as those created by random molecular
motions, this simple expression, ∆pC = 2S/RC, must be couched in terms of the
probability that a vacancy, RC, will occur during the time for which the tension
is applied or the time of observation. This would then yield a probability that
the liquid would rupture under a given tension during the available time.
It is of interest to substitute a typical surface tension, S = 0.05 kg/s2, and a
critical vacancy or bubble size, RC, comparable with the intermolecular distance

of 10−10 m. Then the calculated tensile strength, ∆pC, would be 109 kg/m s2
or 104 atm. This is clearly in accord with the estimate of the tensile strength
outlined in Section 1.4 but, of course, at variance with any of the experimental
observations.
Equation (1.4) is the ﬁrst of three basic relations that constitute homoge-
neous nucleation theory. The second expression we need to identify is that giving
the increment of energy that must be deposited in the body of the pure liquid
in order to create a nucleus or microbubble of the critical size, RC. Assuming
that the critical nucleus is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings
after its creation, then the increment of energy that must be deposited consists
of two parts. First, energy must be deposited to account for that stored in the
surface of the bubble. By deﬁnition of the surface tension, S, that amount is S
per unit surface area for a total of 4πR2
CS. But, in addition, the liquid has to be
displaced outward in order to create the bubble, and this implies work done on
or by the system. The pressure diﬀerence involved in this energy increment is
the diﬀerence between the pressure inside and outside of the bubble (which, in
this evaluation, is ∆pC, given by Equation (1.4)). The work done is the volume
of the bubble multiplied by this pressure diﬀerence, or 4πR3
C∆pC/3, and this is
the work done by the liquid to achieve the displacement implied by the creation
of the bubble. Thus the net energy, WCR, that must be deposited to form the
bubble is
WCR = 4πR2
CS −4
3πR3
C∆pC = 4
3πR2
CS
(1.5)
It can also be useful to eliminate RC from Equations (1.4) and (1.5) to write
the expression for the critical deposition energy as
WCR = 16πS3/3(∆pC)2
(1.6)
It was, in fact, Gibbs (1961) who ﬁrst formulated this expression. For more
detailed considerations the reader is referred to the works of Skripov (1974) and
many others.
The ﬁnal step in homogeneous nucleation theory is an evaluation of the
mechansims by which energy deposition could occur and the probability of that
energy reaching the magnitude, WCR, in the available time. Then Equation
(1.6) yields the probability of the liquid being able to sustain a tension of ∆pC
during that time. In the body of a pure liquid completely isolated from any ex-
ternal radiation, the issue is reduced to an evaluation of the probability that the
stochastic nature of the thermal motions of the molecules would lead to a local
energy perturbation of magnitude WCR. Most of the homogeneous nucleation
theories therefore relate WCR to the typical kinetic energy of the molecules,
namely kT (k is Boltzmann’s constant) and the relationship is couched in terms
of a Gibbs number,
Gb = WCR/kT
(1.7)
It follows that a given Gibbs number will correspond to a certain probability of
a nucleation event in a given volume during a given available time. For later use
it is wise to point out that other basic relations for WCR have been proposed.

For example, Lienhard and Karimi (1981) ﬁnd that a value of WCR related to
kTC (where TC is the critical temperature) rather than kT leads to a better
correlation with experimental observations.
A number of expressions have been proposed for the precise form of the
relationship between the nucleation rate, J, deﬁned as the number of nucleation
events occurring in a unit volume per unit time and the Gibbs number, Gb, but
all take the general form
J = JOe−Gb
(1.8)
where JO is some factor of proportionality. Various functional forms have been
suggested for JO. A typical form is that given by Blander and Katz (1975),
namely
JO = N
 2S
πm
 1
2
(1.9)
where N is the number density of the liquid (molecules/m3) and m is the mass
of a molecule. Though JO may be a function of temperature, the eﬀect of an
error in JO is small compared with the eﬀect on the exponent, Gb, in Equation
(1.8).
1.8
COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS
The nucleation rate, J, is given by Equations (1.8), (1.7), (1.6), and some form
for JO, such as Equation (1.9). It varies with temperature in ways that are
important to identify in order to understand the experimental observations.
Consider the tension, ∆pC, which corresponds to a given nucleation rate, J,
according to these equations:
∆pC =

16πS3
3kT ln(JO/J)
 1
2
(1.10)
This can be used to calculate the tensile strength of the liquid given the temper-
ature, T, knowledge of the surface tension variation with temperature, and other
ﬂuid properties, plus a selected criterion deﬁning a speciﬁc critical nucleation
rate, J. Note ﬁrst that the most important eﬀect of the temperature on the ten-
sion occurs through the variation of the S3 in the numerator. Since S is roughly
linear with T declining to zero at the critical point, it follows that ∆pC will be a
strong function of temperature close to the critical point because of the S3 term.
In contrast, any temperature dependence of JO is almost negligible because it
occurs in the argument of the logarithm. At lower temperatures, far from the
critical point, the dependence of ∆pC on temperature is weak since S3 varies
little, so the tensile strength, ∆pC, will not change much with temperature.
For reasons that will become clear as we progress, it is convenient to divide
the discussion of the experimental results into two temperature ranges: above
and below that temperature for which the spinodal pressure is roughly zero.
This dividing temperature can be derived from an applicable equation of state
and turns out to be about T/TC = 0.9.

Figure 1.4: Experimentally observed average lifetimes (1/J) of a unit volume of
superheated diethyl ether at four diﬀerent pressures of (1) 1 bar (2) 5 bar (3)
10 bar and (4) 15 bar plotted against the saturation temperature, TS. Lines
correspond to two diﬀerent homogeneous nucleation theories. (From Skripov
1974).
For temperatures between TC and 0.9 TC, the tensile strengths calculated
from Equation (1.10) are fairly modest. This is because the critical cluster radii,
RC = 2S/∆pC, is quite large. For example, a tension of 1 bar corresponds to
a nucleus RC = 1 µm. It follows that sub-micron-sized contamination particles
or microbubbles will have little eﬀect on the experiments in this temperature
range because the thermal weaknesses are larger. Figure 1.4, taken from Skripov
(1974), presents typical experimental values for the average lifetime, J−1, of a
unit volume of superheated liquid, in this case diethyl ether. The data is plot-
ted against the saturation temperature, TS, for experiments conducted at four
diﬀerent, positive pressures (since the pressures are positive, all the data lies in
the TC > T > 0.9TC domain). Figure 1.4 illustrates several important features.
First, all of the data for J−1 < 5s correspond to homogeneous nucleation and
show fairly good agreement with homogeneous nucleation theory. The radical
departure of the experimental data from the theory for J−1 > 5s is caused
by radiation that induces nucleation at much smaller superheats. The ﬁgure
also illustrates how weakly the superheat limit depends on the selected value of
the “critical” nucleation rate, as was anticipated in our comments on Equation
(1.10). Since the lines are almost vertical, one can obtain from the experimental

Figure 1.5: Limit of superheat data for ﬁve diﬀerent liquids compared with the
liquid spinodal lines derived from ﬁve diﬀerent equations of state including van
der Waal’s (1) and Berthelot’s (5). (From Eberhart and Schnyders 1973).
results a maximum possible superheat or tension without the need to stipulate a
speciﬁc critical nucleation rate. Figure 1.5, taken from Eberhart and Schnyders
(1973), presents data on this superheat limit for ﬁve diﬀerent liquids.
For most liquids in this range of positive pressures, the maximum possible
superheat is accurately predicted by homogeneous nucleation theory. Indeed,
Lienhard and Karimi (1981) have demonstrated that this limit should be so close
to the liquid spinodal line that the data can be used to test model equations of
state for the liquid in the metastable region. Figure 1.5 includes a comparison
with several such constitutive laws. The data in Figure 1.5 correspond with a
critical Gibbs number of 11.5, a value that can be used with Equations (1.6)
and (1.7) to yield a simple expression for the superheat limit of most liquids in
the range of positive pressures.
Unfortunately, one of the exceptions to the rule is the most common liquid of
all, water. Even for T > 0.9TC, experimental data lie well below the maximum
superheat prediction.
For example, the estimated temperature of maximum
superheat at atmospheric pressure is about 300◦C and the maximum that has
been attained experimentally is 280◦C. The reasons for this discrepancy do not
seem to be well understood (Eberhart and Schnyders 1973).
The above remarks addressed the range of temperatures above 0.9TC. We
now turn to the diﬀerences that occur at lower temperatures.
Below about
0.9TC, the superheat limit corresponds to a negative pressure. Indeed, Figure
1.5 includes data down to about −0.4pC (T ≈0.85TC) and demonstrates that
the prediction of the superheat limit from homogeneous nucleation theory works
quite well down to this temperature. Lienhard and Karimi (1981) have examined
the theoretical limit for water at even lower temperatures and conclude that a
more accurate criterion than Gb = 11.5 is WCR/kTC = 11.5.
One of the reasons for the increasing inaccuracy and uncertainty at lower
temperatures is that the homogeneous nucleation theory implies larger and

larger tensions, ∆pC, and therefore smaller and smaller critical cluster radii. It
follows that almost all of the other nucleation initiators become more important
and cause rupture at tensions much smaller than predicted by homogeneous nu-
cleation theory. In water, the uncertainty that was even present for T > 0.9TC
is increased even further, and homogeneous nucleation theory becomes virtually
irrelevant in water at normal temperatures.
1.9
EXPERIMENTS ON TENSILE
STRENGTH
Experiments on the tensile strength of water date back to Berthelot (1850)
whose basic method has been subsequently used by many investigators.
It
consists of sealing very pure, degassed liquid in a freshly formed capillary tube
under vacuum conditions. Heating the tube causes the liquid to expand, ﬁlling
the tube at some elevated temperature (and pressure). Upon cooling, rupture
is observed at some particular temperature (and pressure). The tensile strength
is obtained from these temperatures and assumed values of the compressibility
of the liquid. Other techniques used include the mechanical bellows of Vincent
(1941) (see also Vincent and Simmonds 1943), the spinning U-tube of Reynolds
(1882), and the piston devices of Davies et al. (1956). All these experiments
are made diﬃcult by the need to carefully control not only the purity of the
liquid but also the properties of the solid surfaces. In many cases it is very
diﬃcult to determine whether homogeneous nucleation has occurred or whether
the rupture occurred at the solid boundary. Furthermore, the data obtained
from such experiments are very scattered.
In freshly drawn capillary tubes, Berthelot (1850) was able to achieve ten-
sions of 50 bar in water at normal temperatures.
With further reﬁnements,
Dixon (1909) was able to get up to 200 bar but still, of course, far short of the
theoretical limit. Similar scattered results have been reported for water and
other liquids by Meyer (1911), Vincent (1941), and others. It is clear that the
material of the container plays an important role; using steel Berthelot tubes,
Rees and Trevena (1966) were not able to approach the high tensions observed in
glass tubes. Clearly, then, the data show that the tensile strength is a function
of the contamination of the liquid and the character of the containing surface,
and we must move on to consider some of the important issues in this regard.
1.10
HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION
In the case of homogeneous nucleation we considered microscopic voids of radius
R, which grow causing rupture when the pressure on the liquid, p, is reduced
below the critical value pV −2S/R. Therefore the tensile strength was 2S/R.
Now consider a number of analogous situations at a solid/liquid interface as
indicated in Figure 1.6. The contact angle at the liquid/vapor/solid intersection
is denoted by θ.
It follows that the tensile strength in the case of the ﬂat

hydrophobic surface is given by 2S sinθ/R where R is the typical maximum
dimension of the void. Hence, in theory, the tensile strength could be zero in
the limit as θ →π. On the other hand, the tensile strength for a hydrophilic
surface is comparable with that for homogeneous nucleation since the maximum
dimensions of the voids are comparable. One could therefore conclude that the
presence of a hydrophobic surface would cause heterogeneous nucleation and
much reduced tensile strength.
Of course, at the microscopic scale with which we are concerned, surfaces are
not ﬂat, so we must consider the eﬀects of other local surface geometries. The
conical cavity of case (c) is usually considered in order to exemplify the eﬀect
of surface geometry. If the half angle at the vertex of this cavity is denoted by
α, then it is clear that zero tensile strength occurs at the more realizable value
of θ = α + π/2 rather than θ →π. Moreover, if θ > α + π/2, it is clear that the
vapor bubble would grow to ﬁll the cavity at pressures above the vapor pressure.
Hence if one considers the range of microscopic surface geometries, then it
is not at all surprising that vapor pockets would grow within some particular
surface cavities at pressures in the neighborhood of the vapor pressure, partic-
ularly when the surface is hydrophobic. Several questions do however remain.
First, how might such a vapor pocket ﬁrst be created? In most experiments it
is quite plausible to conceive of minute pockets of contaminant gas absorbed in
the solid surface. This is perhaps least likely with freshly formed glass capillary
tubes, a fact that may help explain the larger tensions measured in Berthelot
Figure 1.6: Various modes of heterogeneous nucleation.

tube experiments. The second question concerns the expansion of these vapor
pockets beyond the envelope of the solid surface and into the body of the liquid.
One could still argue that dramatic rupture requires the appearance of large
voids in the body of the liquid and hence that the ﬂat surface conﬁgurations
should still be applicable on a larger scale. The answer clearly lies with the de-
tailed topology of the surface. If the opening of the cavity has dimensions of the
order of 10−5 m, the subsequent tension required to expand the bubble beyond
the envelope of the surface is only of the order of a tenth of an atmosphere and
hence quite within the realm of experimental observation.
It is clear that some speciﬁc sites on a solid surface will have the optimum
geometry to promote the growth and macroscopic appearance of vapor bubbles.
Such locations are called nucleation sites. Furthermore, it is clear that as the
pressure is reduced more and more, sites will become capable of generating and
releasing bubbles to the body of the liquid. These events are readily observed
when you boil a pot of water on the stove. At the initiation of boiling, bubbles
are produced at a few speciﬁc sites. As the pot gets hotter more and more sites
become activated. Hence the density of nucleation sites as a function of the
superheat is an important component in the quantiﬁcation of nucleate boiling.
1.11
NUCLEATION SITE POPULATIONS
In pool boiling the hottest liquid is in contact with the solid heated wall of the
pool, and hence all the important nucleation sites occur in that surface. For
the purpose of quantifying the process of nucleation it is necessary to deﬁne a
surface number density distribution function for the nucleation sites, N(RP),
where N(RP)dRP is the number of sites with size between RP and RP + dRP
per unit surface area (thus N has units m−3). In addition to this, it is necessary
to know the range of sizes brought into operation by a given superheat, ∆T.
Characteristically, all sizes greater than R∗
P will be excited by a tension of
βS/R∗
P where β is some constant of order unity. This corresponds to a critical
superheat given by
∆T = βST/LρV R∗
P
(1.11)
Thus the number of sites per unit surface area, n(∆T), brought into operation
by a speciﬁc superheat, ∆T, is given by

The data of Griﬃth and Wallis (1960), presented in Figure 1.7, illustrates this
eﬀect. On the left of this ﬁgure are the measurements of the number of active
sites per unit surface area, n, for a particular polished copper surface and the
three diﬀerent liquids. The three curves would correspond to diﬀerent N(RP)
for the three liquids. The graph on the right is obtained using Equation (1.11)

with β = 2 and demonstrates the veracity of Equation (1.12) for a particular
surface.
Identiﬁcation of the nucleation sites involved in the process of cavitation is
much more diﬃcult and has sparked a number of controversies in the past. This
is because, unlike pool boiling where the largest tensions are experienced by
liquid in contact with a heated surface, a reduction in pressure is experienced
by the liquid bulk. Consequently very small particles or microbubbles present
as contaminants in the bulk of the liquid are also potential nucleation sites.
In particular, cavities in micron-sized particles were ﬁrst suggested by Harvey
et al.
(1944) as potential “cavitation nuclei.”
In the context of cavitating
ﬂows such particles are called “free stream nuclei” to distinguish them from the
“surface nuclei” present in the macroscopic surfaces bounding the ﬂow. As we
shall see later, many of the observations of the onset of cavitation appear to
be the result of the excitation of free stream nuclei rather than surface nuclei.
Hence there is a need to characterize these free stream nuclei in any particular
technological context and a need to control their concentration in any basic
experimental study. Neither of these tasks is particularly easy; indeed, it was
not until recently that reliable methods for the measurement of free stream
nuclei number densities were developed for use in liquid systems of any size.
Methods used in the past include the analysis of samples by Coulter counter,
and acoustic and light scattering techniques (Billet 1985). However, the most
reliable data are probably obtained from holograms of the liquid, which can be
reconstructed and microscopically inspected. The resulting size distributions are
usually presented as nuclei number density distribution functions, N(RN), such
that the number of free stream nuclei in the size range from RN to RN + dRN
present in a unit volume is N(RN)dRN (N has units m−4).

Bacon 1978, Katz 1978) at the cavitation numbers, σ, as shown) and in the
ocean oﬀLos Angeles, Calif. (O’Hern et al. 1985, 1988).
Figure 1.8 are some typical distributions measured in the ﬁltered and deaerated
water of three diﬀerent water tunnels and in the Paciﬁc Ocean oﬀLos Angeles,
California (O’Hern et al. 1985, 1988). Other observations (Billet 1985) produce
distributions of similar general shape (roughly N ∝R−4
N
for RN > 5 µm) but
with larger values at higher air contents.
It is much more diﬃcult to identify the character of these nuclei. As dis-
cussed in the next section, there are real questions as to how small gas-ﬁlled
microbubbles could exist for any length of time in a body of liquid that is not
saturated with that gas. It is not possible to separately assess the number of

solid particles and the number of microbubbles with most of the existing ex-
perimental techniques. Though both can act as cavitation nucleation sites, it
is clear that microbubbles will more readily grow to observable macroscopic
bubbles. One method that has been used to count only those nuclei that will
cavitate involves withdrawing sample ﬂuid and sucking it through a very small
venturi. Nuclei cavitate at the low pressure in the throat and can be counted
provided the concentration is small enough so that the events are separated in
time. Then the concentrations of nuclei can be obtained as functions of the
pressure level in the throat if the ﬂow rate is known. Such devices are known
as cavitation susceptibility meters and tend to be limited to concentrations less
than 10 cm−3 (Billet 1985).
If all of the free stream nuclei were uniform in composition and character, one
could conclude that a certain tension ∆p would activate all nuclei larger than
β∆p/S where β is constant. However, the lack of knowledge of the composi-
tion and character of the nuclei as well as other ﬂuid mechanical complications
greatly reduces the value of such a statement.
1.12
EFFECT OF CONTAMINANT GAS
Virtually all liquids contain some dissolved gas. Indeed it is virtually impossible
to eliminate this gas from any substantial liquid volume. For example, it takes
weeks of deaeration to reduce the concentration of air in the water of a tunnel
below 3 ppm (saturation at atmospheric pressure is about 15 ppm).
If the
nucleation bubble contains some gas, then the pressure in the bubble is the
sum of the partial pressure of this gas, pG, and the vapor pressure. Hence the
equilibrium pressure in the liquid is p = pV +pG −2S/R and the critical tension
is 2S/R −pG. Thus dissolved gas will decrease the potential tensile strength;
indeed, if the concentration of gas leads to suﬃciently large values of pG, the
tensile strength is negative and the bubble will grow at liquid pressures greater
than the vapor pressure.
We refer in the above to circumstances in which the liquid is not saturated
with gas at the pressure at which it has been stored. In theory, no gas bubbles
can exist in equilibrium in a liquid unsaturated with gas but otherwise pure
if the pressure is maintained above pV + pG where pG is the equilibrium gas
pressure (see Section 2.6). They should dissolve and disappear, thus causing
a dramatic increase in the tensile strength of the liquid. While it is true that
degassing or high pressure treatment does cause some increase in tensile strength
(Keller 1974), the eﬀect is not as great as one would expect. This dilemma has
sparked some controversy in the past and at least three plausible explanations
have been advanced, all of which have some merit. First is the Harvey nucleus
mentioned earlier in which the bubble exists in a crevice in a particle or surface
and persists because its geometry is such that the free surface has a highly
convex curvature viewed from the ﬂuid so that surface tension supports the high
liquid pressure. Second and more esoteric is the possibility of the continuous
production of nuclei by cosmic radiation. Third is the proposal by Fox and

Herzfeld (1954) of an “organic skin” that gives the free surface of the bubble
suﬃcient elasticity to withstand high pressure. Though originally less plausible
than the ﬁrst two possibilities, this explanation is now more widely accepted
because of recent advances in surface rheology, which show that quite small
amounts of contaminant in the liquid can generate large elastic surface eﬀects.
Such contamination of the surface has also been detected by electron microscopy.
1.13
NUCLEATION IN FLOWING LIQUIDS
Perhaps the commonest occurrence of cavitation is in ﬂowing liquid systems
where hydrodynamic eﬀects result in regions of the ﬂow where the pressure falls
below the vapor pressure.
Reynolds (1873) was among the ﬁrst to attempt
to explain the unusual behaviour of ship propellers at the higher rotational
speeds that were being achieved during the second half of the ninteenth century.
Reynolds focused on the possibility of the entrainment of air into the wakes of
the propellor blades, a phenomenon we now term “ventilation.” He does not,
however, seem to have envisaged the possibility of vapor-ﬁlled wakes, and it
was left to Parsons (1906) to recognize the role played by vaporization. He also
conducted the ﬁrst experiments on “cavitation” (a word suggested by Froude),
and the phenomenon has been a subject of intensive research ever since because
of the adverse eﬀects it has on performance, because of the noise it creates and,
most surprisingly, the damage it can do to nearby solid surfaces.
For the purposes of the present discussion we shall consider a steady, single-
phase ﬂow of a Newtonian liquid of constant density, ρL, velocity ﬁeld, ui(xi),
and pressure, p(xi). In all such ﬂows it is convenient to deﬁne a reference veloc-
ity, U∞, and reference pressure, p∞. In external ﬂows around solid bodies, U∞
and p∞are conventionally the velocity and pressure of the uniform, upstream
ﬂow. The equations of motion are such that changing the reference pressure
results in the same uniform change to the pressure throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld.
Thus the pressure coeﬃcient
Cp(xi) = p(xi) −p∞
1
2ρU 2∞
(1.13)
is independent of p∞for a given geometry of the macroscopic ﬂow boundaries.
Furthermore, there will be some location, x∗
i , within the ﬂow where Cp and p
are a minimum, and that value of Cp(x∗
i ) will be denoted for convenience by
Cpmin. Note that this is a negative number.
Viscous eﬀects within the ﬂow are characterized by the Reynolds number,
Re = ρLU∞ℓ/µL = U∞ℓ/νL where µL and νL are the dynamic and kinematic
viscosities of the liquid and ℓis the characterized length scale.
For a given
geometry, Cp(xi) and Cpmin are functions only of Re in steady ﬂows. In the
idealized case of an inviscid, frictionless liquid, Bernoulli’s equation applies and
Cp(xi) and Cpmin become dependent only on the geometry of the ﬂow bound-
aries and not on any other parameters. For purposes of the present discussion,
we shall suppose that for the ﬂow geometry under consideration, the value of

Figure 1.9: Schematic of pressure distribution on a streamline.
Cpmin for the single-phase ﬂow is known either from experimental measurement
or theoretical calculation.
The stage is therefore set to consider what happens in a given ﬂow when ei-
ther the overall pressure is decreased or the ﬂow velocity is increased so that the
pressure at some point in the ﬂow approaches the vapor pressure, pV , of the liq-
uid at the reference temperature, T∞. In order to characterize this relationship,
it is conventional to deﬁne the cavitation number, σ as
σ = p∞−pV (T∞)
1
2ρLU 2∞
(1.14)
Any ﬂow, whether cavitating or not, has some value of σ. Clearly if σ is suf-
ﬁciently large (p∞suﬃciently large compared with pV (T∞) or U∞suﬃciently
small), single-phase liquid ﬂow will occur. However, as σ is reduced, nucleation
will ﬁrst occur at some particular value of σ called the incipient cavitation num-
ber and denoted by σi. For the moment we shall ignore the practical diﬃculties
involved in observing cavitation inception.
Further reduction in σ below σi
causes an increase in the number and extent of vapor bubbles.
In the hypothetical ﬂow of a liquid that cannot withstand any tension and
in which vapor bubbles appear instantaneously when p reaches pV , it is clear
that
σi = −Cpmin
(1.15)
and hence the incipient cavitation number could be ascertained from observa-
tions or measurements of the single-phase ﬂow.
To exemplify this, consider
the nucleation of a free stream nucleus as it travels along the streamline con-
taining x∗
i (see Figure 1.9).
For σ > −Cpmin the pressure along the entire

trajectory is greater than pV . For σ = −Cpmin the nucleus encounters p = pV
only for an inﬁnitesmal moment.
For σ < −Cpmin the nucleus experiences
p < pV for a ﬁnite time. In so far as free steam nuclei are concerned, two fac-
tors can cause σi to be diﬀerent from −Cpmin (remember again that −Cpmin
is generally a positive number). First, nucleation may not occur at p = pV .
In a degassed liquid nucleation may require a positive tension, say ∆pC, and
hence nucleation would require a cavitation number less than −Cpmin, namely
σi = −Cpmin −∆pC/ 1
2ρLU 2
∞. In a liquid containing a great deal of contaminant
gas ∆pC could actually be negative, so that σi would be larger than −Cpmin.
Second, growth of a nucleus to a ﬁnite, observable size requires a ﬁnite time
under conditions p < pV −∆pC. This residence time eﬀect will cause the ob-
served σi to be less than −Cpmin −∆pC/ 1
2ρLU 2
∞. As we shall see in the next
chapter, the rate of growth of a bubble can also be radically aﬀected by the
thermodynamic properties of the liquid and vapor which are, in turn, functions
of the temperature of the liquid. Consequently σi may also depend on the liquid
temperature.
1.14
VISCOUS EFFECTS IN
CAVITATION INCEPTION
The discussion in the previous section was deliberately conﬁned to ideal, steady
ﬂows. When the ﬂow is also assumed to be inviscid, the value of −Cpmin is a
simple positive constant for a given ﬂow geometry. However, when the eﬀects
of viscosity are included, Cpmin will be a function of Reynolds number, Re, and
even in a steady ﬂow one would therefore expect to observe a dependence of the
incipient cavitation number, σi, on the Reynolds number. For convenience, we
shall refer to this as the steady viscous eﬀect.
Up to this point we have assumed that the ﬂow and the pressures are laminar
and steady. However, most of the ﬂows with which the engineer must deal are
not only turbulent but also unsteady.
Vortices occur not only because they
are inherent in turbulence but also because of both free and forced shedding
of vortices. This has important consequences for cavitation inception because
the pressure in the center of a vortex may be signiﬁcantly lower than the mean
pressure in the ﬂow. The measurement or calculation of −Cpmin would elicit
the value of the lowest mean pressure, while cavitation might ﬁrst occur in
a transient vortex whose core pressure was much lower than the lowest mean
pressure.
Unlike the residence time factor, this would tend to cause higher
values of σi than would otherwise be expected. It would also cause σi to change
with Reynolds number, Re. Note that this would be separate from the eﬀect of
Re on Cpmin and, to distinguish it, we shall refer to it as the turbulence eﬀect.
In summary, there are a number of reasons for σi to be diﬀerent from the
value of −Cpmin that might be calculated from knowledge of the pressures in
the single-phase liquid ﬂow:
1. Existence of a tensile strength can cause a reduction in σi.

2. Residence time eﬀects can cause a reduction in σi.
3. Existence of contaminant gas can cause an increase in σi.
4. Steady viscous eﬀect due to dependence of Cpmin on Re can cause σi to
be a function of Re.
5. Turbulence eﬀects can cause an increase in σi.
If it were not for these eﬀects, the prediction of cavitation would be a straight-
forward matter of determining Cpmin. Unfortunately, these eﬀects can cause
large departures from the criterion, σi = −Cpmin, with important engineering
consequences in many applications.
Furthermore, the above discussion identiﬁes the parameters that must be
controlled or at least measured in systematic experiments on cavitation incep-
tion:
1. The cavitation number, σ.
2. The Reynolds number, Re.
3. The liquid temperature, T∞.
4. The liquid quality, including the number and nature of the free stream
nuclei, the amount of dissolved gas, and the free stream turbulence.
5. The quality of the solid, bounding surfaces, including the roughness (since
this may aﬀect the hydrodynamics) and the porosity or pit population.
Since this is a tall order, and many of the eﬀects such as the interaction of
turbulence and cavitation inception have only recently been identiﬁed, it is
not surprising that the individual eﬀects are not readily isolated from many of
the experiments performed in the past. Nevertheless, some discussion of these
experiments is important for practical reasons.
1.15
CAVITATION INCEPTION
MEASUREMENTS
To illustrate some of the eﬀects described in the preceding section, we shall
attempt to give a brief overview of the extensive literature on the subject of
cavitation inception. For more detail, the reader is referred to the reviews by
Acosta and Parkin (1975), Arakeri (1979), and Rood (1991), as well as to the
book by Knapp, Daily, and Hammitt (1970).
The ﬁrst eﬀect that we illustrate is that of the uncertainty in the tensile
strength of the liquid. It is very diﬃcult to characterize and almost impossible
to remove from a substantial body of liquid (such as that used in a water tunnel)
all the particles, microbubbles, and contaminant gas that will aﬀect nucleation.
This can cause substantial diﬀerences in the cavitation inception numbers (and,

Figure 1.10: The inception numbers measured for the same axisymmetric head-
form in a variety of water tunnels around the world. Data collected as part of
a comparative study of cavitation inception by the International Towing Tank
Conference (Lindgren and Johnsson 1966, Johnsson 1969).
indeed, the form of cavitation) from diﬀerent facilities and even in the same
facility with diﬀerently treated water. The ITTC (International Towing Tank
Conference) comparative tests (Lindgren and Johnsson 1966, Johnsson 1969)
provided a particularly dramatic example of these diﬀerences when cavitation
on the same axisymmetric headform (called the ITTC headform) was examined
in many diﬀerent water tunnels around the world. An example of the variation
of σi in those experiments is reproduced as Figure 1.10.
As a further illustration, Figure 1.11 reproduces data obtained by Keller
(1974) for the cavitation inception number in ﬂows around hemispherical bodies.
The water was treated in diﬀerent ways so that it contained diﬀerent populations
of nuclei as shown on the left in Figure 1.11. As one might anticipate, the water
with the higher nuclei population had a substantially larger cavitation inception
number.
Because the cavitation nuclei are crucial to an understanding of cavitation
inception, it is now recognized that the liquid in any cavitation inception study
must be monitored by measuring the number of nuclei present in the liquid.
Typical nuclei number distributions from water tunnels and from the ocean
were shown earlier in Figure 1.8. It should, however, be noted that most of the
methods currently used for making these measurements are still in the develop-
ment stage. Devices based on acoustic scattering and on light scattering have

water and the corresponding cavitation inception numbers on hemispherical

been explored.
Other instruments known as cavitation susceptibility meters
cause samples of the liquid to cavitate and measure the number and size of the
resulting macroscopic bubbles. Perhaps the most reliable method has been the
use of holography to create a magniﬁed three-dimensional photographic image
of a sample volume of liquid, which can then be surveyed for nuclei. Billet (1985)
has recently reviewed the current state of cavitation nuclei measurements (see
also Katz et al. 1984).
It may be of interest to note that cavitation itself is also a source of nuclei
in many facilities. This is because air dissolved in the liquid will tend to come
out of solution at low pressures and contribute a partial pressure of air to the
contents of any macroscopic cavitation bubble. When that bubble is convected
into regions of higher pressure and the vapor condenses, this leaves a small air
bubble that only redissolves very slowly, if at all. This unforeseen phenomenon
caused great trauma for the ﬁrst water tunnels, which were modeled directly on
wind tunnels. It was discovered that after a few minutes of operating with a
cavitating body in the working section, the bubbles produced by the cavitation
grew rapidly in number and began to complete the circuit of the facility to
return in the incoming ﬂow. Soon the working section was obscured by a two-
phase ﬂow. The solution had two components. First, a water tunnel needs to
be ﬁtted with a long and deep return leg so that the water remains at high

pressure for suﬃcient time to redissolve most of the cavitation-produced nuclei.
Such a return leg is termed a “resorber.” Second, most water tunnel facilities
have a “deaerator” for reducing the air content of the water to 20 to 50% of
the saturation level. These comments serve to illustrate the fact that N(RN) in
any facility can change according to the operating condition and can be altered
both by deaeration and by ﬁltration.
One of the consequences of the eﬀect of cavitation itself on the nuclei popu-
lation in a facility is that the cavitation number at which cavitation disappears
when the pressure is raised may be diﬀerent from the value of the cavitation
number at which it appeared when the pressure was decreased. The ﬁrst value
is termed the “desinent” cavitation number and is denoted by σd to distin-
guish it from the inception number, σi. The diﬀerence in these values is termed
“cavitation hysteresis” (Holl and Treaster 1966).
One of the additional complications is the subjective nature of the judgment
that cavitation has appeared. Visual inspection is not always possible, nor is it
very objective since the number of events (single bubble growth and collapse)
tends to increase gradually over a range of cavitation numbers. If, therefore, one
made a judgment based on a certain event rate, it is inevitable that the inception
cavitation number would increase with nuclei population. Experiments have
found that the production of noise is a simpler and more repeatable measure
of inception than visual observation. While still subject to the variations with
nuclei population discussed above, it has the advantage of being quantiﬁable.
Most of the data of Figure 1.8 is taken from water tunnel water that has been
somewhat ﬁltered and degassed or from the ocean, which is surprisingly clean.
Thus there are very few nuclei with a size greater than 100 µm. On the other
hand, there are many hydraulic applications in which the water contains much
larger gas bubbles.
These can then grow substantially as they pass through
a region of low pressure in the pump or other hydraulic device, even though
the pressure is everywhere above the vapor pressure. Such a phenomenon is
called “pseudo-cavitation.” Though a cavitation inception number is not par-
ticularly relevant to such circumstances, attempts to measure σi under these
circumstances would clearly yield values much larger than −Cpmin.
On the other hand, if the liquid is quite clean with only very small nuclei,
the tension that this liquid can sustain would mean that the minimum pressure
would have to fall well below pV for inception to occur. Then σi would be much
smaller than −Cpmin. Thus it is clear that the quality of the water and its
nuclei could cause the cavitation inception number to be either larger or smaller
than −Cpmin.
1.16
CAVITATION INCEPTION DATA
Though much of the inception data in the literature is deﬁcient in the sense that
the nuclei population and character are unknown, it is nevertheless of value to
review some of the important trends in that data base. In doing so we could
be reassured that each investigator probably applied a consistent criterion in

Figure 1.12: Cavitation inception characteristics of a NACA 4412 hydrofoil
(Kermeen 1956).
assessing cavitation inception. Therefore, though the data from diﬀerent inves-
tigators and facilities may be widely scattered, one would hope that the trends
exhibited in a particular research project would be qualitatively signiﬁcant.
Consider ﬁrst the inception characteristics of a single hydrofoil as the angle
of attack is varied. The data of Kermeen (1956), obtained for a NACA 4412
hydrofoil, is reproduced in Figure 1.12. At positive angles of attack the regions
of low pressure and cavitation inception will occur on the suction surface; at
negative angles of attack these phenomena will shift to the pressure surface.
Furthermore, as the angle of attack is increased in either direction, the value
of −Cpmin will increase, and hence the inception cavitation number will also
increase.
As we will discuss in the next section, the scaling of cavitation inception with
changes in the size and speed of the hydraulic device can be an important issue,
particularly when scaling the results from model-scale water tunnel experiments
to prototypes as is necessary, for example, in developing ship propellers. Typical
data on cavitation inception for a single hydrofoil (Holl and Wislicenus 1961)
is reproduced in Figure 1.13. Data for three diﬀerent sizes of 12% Joukowski
hydrofoil (at zero angle of attack) were obtained at diﬀerent speeds. They were
plotted against Reynolds number in the hope that this would reduce the data
to a single curve.
The fact that this did not occur demonstrates that there
is a size or speed eﬀect separate from that due to the Reynolds number. It

Figure 1.13: The desinent cavitation numbers for three sizes of Joukowski hy-
drofoils at zero angle of attack and as a function of Reynolds number, Re (Holl
and Wislicenus 1961). Note the theoretical Cpmin = −0.54.
seems reasonable to suggest that the missing parameter is the ratio of the nuclei
size to chord length; however, in the absence of information on the nuclei, such
conclusions are purely speculative.
To complete the list of those factors that may inﬂuence cavitation inception,
it is necessary to mention the eﬀects of surface roughness and of the turbulence
level in the ﬂow. The two eﬀects are connected to some degree since roughness
will aﬀect the level of turbulence. But roughness can also aﬀect the ﬂow by
delaying boundary layer separation and therefore aﬀecting the pressure and ve-
locity ﬁelds in a more global manner. The reader is referred to Arndt and Ippen
(1968) for details of the eﬀects of surface roughness on cavitation inception.
Turbulence aﬀects cavitation inception since a nucleus may ﬁnd itself in
the core of a vortex where the pressure level is lower than the mean. It could
therefore cavitate when it might not do so under the inﬂuence of the mean
pressure level. Thus turbulence may promote cavitation, but one must allow
for the fact that it may alter the global pressure ﬁeld by altering the location of
ﬂow separation. These complicated viscous eﬀects on cavitation inception were
ﬁrst examined in detail by Arakeri and Acosta (1974) and Gates and Acosta
(1978) (see also Arakeri 1979). The implications for cavitation inception in the
highly turbulent environment of many internal ﬂows such as occur in pumps
have yet to be examined in detail.

1.17
SCALING OF CAVITATION INCEPTION
The complexity of the issues raised in the last section helps to explain why
serious questions remain as to how to scale cavitation inception. This is perhaps
one of the most troublesome issues a hydraulic engineer must face. Model tests
of a ship’s propeller or large pump-turbine may allow the designer to accurately
estimate the noncavitating performance of the device.
However, he will not
be able to place anything like the same conﬁdence in his ability to scale the
cavitation inception data.
Consider the problem in more detail. Changing the size of the device will
alter not only the residence time eﬀect but also the Reynolds number. Further-
more, the nuclei will now be a diﬀerent size relative to the device than in the
model. Changing the speed in an attempt to maintain Reynolds number scaling
may only confuse the issue by further alterating the residence time. Moreover,
changing the speed will also change the cavitation number. To recover the mod-
eled condition, one must then change the pressure level, which may alter the
nuclei content. There is also the issue of what to do about the surface roughness
in the model and in the prototype.
The other issue of scaling that arises is how to anticipate the cavitation
phenomena in one liquid based on data obtained in another. It is clearly the case
that the literature contains a great deal of data on water. Data on other liquids
are quite meager. Indeed, I have not located any nuclei number distributions
for a ﬂuid other than water. Since the nuclei play such a key role, it is not
surprising that our current ability to scale from one liquid to another is quite
tentative.
It would not be appropriate to leave this subject without emphasizing that
most of the remarks in the last two sections have focused on the inception of
cavitation. Once cavitation has become established, the phenomena that occur
are much less sensitive to special factors such as the nuclei content. Hence the
scaling of developed cavitation can proceed with much more conﬁdence than
the scaling of cavitation inception. This is not, however, of much solace to the
engineer charged with avoiding cavitation completely.

SPHERICAL BUBBLE
DYNAMICS
2.1
INTRODUCTION
Having considered the initial formation of bubbles, we now proceed to identify
the subsequent dynamics of bubble growth and collapse. The behavior of a sin-
gle bubble in an inﬁnite domain of liquid at rest far from the bubble and with
uniform temperature far from the bubble will be examined ﬁrst. This spher-
ically symmetric situation provides a simple case that is amenable to analysis
and reveals a number of important phenomena. Complications such as those
introduced by the presence of nearby solid boundaries will be discussed in the
chapters which follow.
2.2
RAYLEIGH-PLESSET EQUATION
Consider a spherical bubble of radius, R(t) (where t is time), in an inﬁnite
domain of liquid whose temperature and pressure far from the bubble are T∞and
p∞(t) respectively. The temperature, T∞, is assumed to be a simple constant
since temperature gradients were eliminated a priori and uniform heating of
the liquid due to internal heat sources or radiation will not be considered. On
the other hand, the pressure, p∞(t), is assumed to be a known (and perhaps
controlled) input which regulates the growth or collapse of the bubble.
Though compressibility of the liquid can be important in the context of bub-
ble collapse, it will, for the present, be assumed that the liquid density, ρL, is
a constant. Furthermore, the dynamic viscosity, µL, is assumed constant and
uniform. It will also be assumed that the contents of the bubble are homoge-
neous and that the temperature, TB(t), and pressure, pB(t), within the bubble
are always uniform. These assumptions may not be justiﬁed in circumstances
that will be identiﬁed as the analysis proceeds.
47

Figure 2.1: Schematic of a spherical bubble in an inﬁnite liquid.
The radius of the bubble, R(t), will be one of the primary results of the
analysis. As indicated in Figure 2.1, radial position within the liquid will be
denoted by the distance, r, from the center of the bubble; the pressure, p(r, t),
radial outward velocity, u(r, t), and temperature, T(r, t), within the liquid will
be so designated. Conservation of mass requires that
u(r, t) = F (t)
r2
(2.1)
where F (t) is related to R(t) by a kinematic boundary condition at the bubble
surface. In the idealized case of zero mass transport across this interface, it is
clear that u(R, t) = dR/dt and hence
F (t) = R2 dR
dt
(2.2)
But this is often a good approximation even when evaporation or condensation
is occurring at the interface. To demonstrate this, consider a vapor bubble. The
volume rate of production of vapor must be equal to the rate of increase of size
of the bubble, 4πR2dR/dt, and therefore the mass rate of evaporation must be
ρV (TB)4πR2dR/dt where ρV (TB) is the saturated vapor density at the bubble
temperature, TB.
This, in turn, must equal the mass ﬂow of liquid inward
relative to the interface, and hence the inward velocity of liquid relative to the
interface is given by ρV (TB)(dR/dt)/ρL. Therefore
u(R, t) = dR
dt −ρV (TB)

Figure 2.2: Portion of the spherical bubble surface.
In many practical cases ρV (TB) ≪ρL and therefore the approximate form of
Equation (2.2) may be adequate. For clarity we will continue with the approx-
imate form given in Equation (2.2).

Note that the viscous terms vanish; indeed, the only viscous contribution to the

(2.7)
after application of the condition p →p∞as r →∞.
To complete this part of the analysis, a dynamic boundary condition on the
bubble surface must be constructed. For this purpose consider a control volume
consisting of a small, inﬁnitely thin lamina containing a segment of interface
(Figure 2.2). The net force on this lamina in the radially outward direction per
unit area is
(σrr)r=R + pB −2S
R
(2.8)
or, since σrr = −p + 2µL∂u/∂r, the force per unit area is
pB −(p)r=R −4µL
R
dR
dt −2S
R
(2.9)

In the absence of mass transport across the boundary (evaporation or conden-
sation) this force must be zero, and substitution of the value for (p)r=R from
Equation (2.7) with F = R2 dR
dt yields the generalized Rayleigh-Plesset equation

Given p∞(t) this represents an equation that can be solved to ﬁnd R(t) provided
pB(t) is known. In the absence of the surface tension and viscous terms, it
was ﬁrst derived and used by Rayleigh (1917). Plesset (1949) ﬁrst applied the
equation to the problem of traveling cavitation bubbles.
2.3
BUBBLE CONTENTS
In addition to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, considerations of the bubble con-
tents are necessary. To be fairly general, it is assumed that the bubble contains
some quantity of contaminant gas whose partial pressure is pGo at some ref-
erence size, Ro, and temperature, T∞. Then, if there is no appreciable mass
transfer of gas to or from the liquid, it follows that
pB(t) = pV (TB) + pGo
 TB
T∞
 Ro
R
3
(2.11)
In some cases this last assumption is not justiﬁed, and it is necessary to solve a
mass transport problem for the liquid in a manner similar to that used for heat
diﬀusion in the next section (see Section 2.6).
It remains to determine TB(t). This is not always necessary since, under
some conditions, the diﬀerence between the unknown TB and the known T∞is
negligible. But there are also circumstances in which the temperature diﬀerence,
(TB(t) −T∞), is important and the eﬀects caused by this diﬀerence dominate
the bubble dynamics. Clearly the temperature diﬀerence, (TB(t) −T∞), leads
to a diﬀerent vapor pressure, pV (TB), than would occur in the absence of such
thermal eﬀects, and this alters the growth or collapse rate of the bubble. It is
therefore instructive to substitute Equation (2.11) into (2.10) and thereby write
the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in the following general form:
(1)

pV (T∞) −p∞(t)

The ﬁrst term, (1), is the instantaneous tension or driving term determined by
the conditions far from the bubble. The second term, (2), will be referred to as

the thermal term, and it will be seen that very diﬀerent bubble dynamics can
be expected depending on the magnitude of this term. When the temperature
diﬀerence is small, it is convenient to use a Taylor expansion in which only the
ﬁrst derivative is retained to evaluate
pV (TB) −pV (T∞)
ρL
= A(TB −T∞)
(2.13)
where the quantity A may be evaluated from
A =
1
ρL
dpV
dT
= ρV (T∞)L(T∞)
ρLT∞
(2.14)
using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. It is consistent with the Taylor expansion
approximation to evaluate ρV and L at the known temperature T∞. It follows
that, for small temperature diﬀerences, term (2) in Equation (2.12) is given by
A(TB −T∞).
The degree to which the bubble temperature, TB, departs from the remote
liquid temperature, T∞, can have a major eﬀect on the bubble dynamics, and
it is neccessary to discuss how this departure might be evaluated. The deter-
mination of (TB −T∞) requires two steps. First, it requires the solution of the
heat diﬀusion equation,


r2 ∂T


(2.15)
to determine the temperature distribution, T(r, t), within the liquid (αL is the
thermal diﬀusivity of the liquid). Second, it requires an energy balance for the
bubble. The heat supplied to the interface from the liquid is
4πR2kL
∂T
∂r

r=R
(2.16)
where kL is the thermal conductivity of the liquid. Assuming that all of this
is used for vaporization of the liquid (this neglects the heat used for heating or
cooling the existing bubble contents, which is negligible in many cases), one can
evaluate the mass rate of production of vapor and relate it to the known rate
of increase the volume of the bubble. This yields
dR
dt = kL
ρV L
∂T
∂r

r=R
(2.17)
where kL, ρV , L should be evaluated at T = TB.
If, however, TB −T∞is
small, it is consistent with the linear analysis described earlier to evaluate these
properties at T = T∞.
The nature of the thermal eﬀect problem is now clear. The thermal term
in the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.12) requires a relation between (TB(t) −
T∞) and R(t). The energy balance Equation (2.17) yields a relation between

(∂T/∂r)r=R and R(t). The ﬁnal relation between (∂T/∂r)r=R and (TB(t)−T∞)
requires the solution of the heat diﬀusion equation. It is this last step that causes
considerable diﬃculty due to the evident nonlinearities in the heat diﬀusion
equation; no exact analytic solution exists. However, the solution of Plesset
and Zwick (1952) provides a useful approximation for many purposes.
This
solution is conﬁned to cases in which the thickness of the thermal boundary
layer, δT , surrounding the bubble is small compared with the radius of the
bubble, a restriction that can be roughly represented by the identity
R ≫δT ≈(T∞−TB)/

This can be directly substituted into the Rayleigh-Plesset equation to generate
a complicated integro-diﬀerential equation for R(t). However, for present pur-
poses it is more instructive to conﬁne our attention to regimes of bubble growth
or collapse that can be approximated by the relation
R = R∗tn
(2.21)

2.4
IN THE ABSENCE OF THERMAL
EFFECTS
First we consider some of the characteristics of bubble dynamics in the absence
of any signiﬁcant thermal eﬀects.
This kind of bubble dynamic behavior is
termed “inertially controlled” to distinguish it from the “thermally controlled”
behavior discussed later.
Under these circumstances the temperature in the
liquid is assumed uniform and term (2) in the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.12)
is zero.
Furthermore, it will be assumed that the behavior of the gas in the bubble
is polytropic so that
pG = pGo
Ro
R
3k
(2.26)
where k is approximately constant. Clearly k = 1 implies a constant bubble
temperature and k = γ would model adiabatic behavior. It should be under-
stood that accurate evaluation of the behavior of the gas in the bubble requires
the solution of the mass, momentum, and energy equations for the bubble con-
tents combined with appropriate boundary conditions which will include a ther-
mal boundary condition at the bubble wall. Such an analysis would probably
assume spherical symmetry.
However, it is appropriate to observe that any
non-spherically symmetric internal motion would tend to mix the contents and,
perhaps, improve the validity of the polytropic assumption.
With the above assumptions the Rayleigh-Plesset equation becomes

where the overdot denotes d/dt. Equation (2.27) without the viscous term was
ﬁrst derived and used by Noltingk and Neppiras (1950, 1951); the viscous term
was investigated ﬁrst by Poritsky (1952).
Equation (2.27) can be readily integrated numerically to ﬁnd R(t) given the
input p∞(t), the temperature T∞, and the other constants. Initial conditions
are also required and, in the context of cavitating ﬂows, it is appropriate to
assume that the microbubble of radius Ro is in equilibrium at t = 0 in the ﬂuid
at a pressure p∞(0) so that
pGo = p∞(0) −pV (T∞) + 2S

(2.28)

Figure 2.3: Typical solution of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for spherical bub-
ble size/ initial size, R/R0. The nucleus enters a low-pressure region at a di-
mensionless time of 0 and is convected back to the original pressure at a dimen-
sionless time of 500. The low-pressure region is sinusoidal and symmetric about
250.
and that dR/dt|t=0 = 0. A typical solution for Equation (2.27) under these
conditions and with a pressure p∞(t), which ﬁrst decreases below p∞(0) and
then recovers to its original value, is shown in Figure 2.3. The general features
of this solution are characteristic of the response of a bubble as it passes through
any low-pressure region; they also reﬂect the strong nonlinearity of Equation
(2.27). The growth is fairly smooth and the maximum size occurs after the
minimum pressure. The collapse process is quite diﬀerent. The bubble collapses
catastrophically, and this is followed by successive rebounds and collapses. In
the absence of dissipation mechanisms such as viscosity these rebounds would
continue indeﬁnitely without attenuation.
Analytic solutions to Equation (2.27) are limited to the case of a step func-
tion change in p∞. Nevertheless, these solutions reveal some of the character-
istics of more general pressure histories, p∞(t), and are therefore valuable to
document. With a constant value of p∞(t > 0) = p∗
∞, Equation (2.27) is inte-
grated by multiplying through by 2R2 ˙R and forming time derivatives. Only the
viscous term cannot be integrated in this way, and what follows is conﬁned to
the inviscid case. After integration, application of the initial condition ˙R(0) = 0

the subsequent velocity of the interface is relatively constant.
It should be
emphasized that Equation (2.33) nevertheless represents explosive growth of
the bubble, in which the volume displacement is increasing like t3.
Now contrast the behavior of a bubble caused to collapse by an increase in
p∞to p∗

where, in the case of k = 1, the gas term is replaced by 2pGo ln(Ro/R)/ρL.
However, most bubble collapse motions become so rapid that the gas behavior
is much closer to adiabatic than isothermal, and we will therefore assume k ̸= 1.
For a bubble with a substantial gas content the asymptotic collapse velocity
given by Equation (2.36) will not be reached and the bubble will simply oscillate
about a new, but smaller, equilibrium radius. On the other hand, when the
bubble contains very little gas, the inward velocity will continually increase
(like R−3/2) until the last term within the square brackets reaches a magnitude
comparable with the other terms. The collapse velocity will then decrease and
a minimum size given by

will be reached, following which the bubble will rebound. Note that, if pGo is
small, the Rmin could be very small indeed. The pressure and temperature of
the gas in the bubble at the minimum radius are then given by pmax and Tmax
where
pmax

pGo [(k −1)(p∗

(2.38)
Tmax

To [(k −1)(p∗

(2.39)
We will comment later on the magnitudes of these temperatures and pressures
(see Section 3.2).
The case of zero gas content presents a special albeit somewhat hypothetical
problem, since apparently the bubble will reach zero size and at that time have
an inﬁnite inward velocity.
In the absence of both surface tension and gas
content, Rayleigh (1917) was able to integrate Equation (2.31) to obtain the
time, tT C, required for total collapse from R = Ro to R = 0:

It is important at this point to emphasize that while the above results for
bubble growth are quite practical, the results for bubble collapse may be quite
misleading. Apart from the neglect of thermal eﬀects, the analysis was based on
two other assumptions that may be violated during collapse. Later we shall see
that the ﬁnal stages of collapse may involve such high velocities (and pressures)
that the assumption of liquid incompressibility is no longer appropriate. But,
perhaps more important, it transpires (see Chapter 5) that a collapsing bub-
ble loses its spherical symmetry in ways that can have important engineering
consequences.

2.5
STABILITY OF VAPOR/GAS BUBBLES
Apart from the characteristic bubble growth and collapse processes discussed in
the last section, it is also important to recognize that the equilibrium condition
pV −p∞+ pGE −
2S
RE
= 0
(2.41)
may not always represent a stable equilibrium state at R = RE with a partial
pressure of gas pGE.
Consider a small perturbation in the size of the bubble from R = RE to
R = RE(1 + ϵ) , ϵ ≪1 and the response resulting from the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation. Care must be taken to distinguish two possible cases:
(i) The partial pressure of the gas remains the same at pGE.
(ii) The mass of gas in the bubble and its temperature, TB, remain the same.
From a practical point of view the Case (i) perturbation is generated over a
length of time suﬃcient to allow adequate mass diﬀusion in the liquid so that
the partial pressure of gas is maintained at the value appropriate to the concen-
tration of gas dissolved in the liquid. On the other hand, Case (ii) is considered
to take place too rapidly for signiﬁcant gas diﬀusion. It follows that in Case
(i) the gas term in the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.27) is pGE/ρL whereas in
Case (ii) it is pGER3k
E /ρLR3k. If n is deﬁned as zero for Case (i) and n = 1 for
Case (ii) then substitution of R = RE(1 + ϵ) into the Rayleigh-Plesset equation
yields

2( ˙R)2 + 4νL
˙R
R =

(2.42)
Note that the right-hand side has the same sign as ϵ if
2S
RE
> 3nkpGE
(2.43)
and a diﬀerent sign if the reverse holds.
Therefore, if the above inequality
holds, the left-hand side of Equation (2.42) implies that the velocity and/or
acceleration of the bubble radius has the same sign as the perturbation, and
hence the equilibrium is unstable since the resulting motion will cause the bubble
to deviate further from R = RE. On the other hand, the equilibrium is stable
if npGE > 2S/3RE.
First consider Case (i) which must always be unstable since the inequality
(2.43) always holds if n = 0. This is simply a restatement of the fact (discussed
in Section 2.6) that, if one allows time for mass diﬀusion, then all bubbles will
either grow or shrink indeﬁnitely.
Case (ii) is more interesting since in many of the practical engineering situ-
ations pressure levels change over a period of time that is short compared with

equilibrium requires

for a given mass of gas there exists a critical bubble size, RC, where
RC =

8πS
1/2
(2.45)
This critical radius was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Blake (1949) and Neppiras and Nolt-
ingk (1951) and is often referred to as the Blake critical radius. All bubbles of
radius RE < RC can exist in stable equilibrium, whereas all bubbles of radius
RE > RC must be unstable. This critical size could be reached by decreasing
the ambient pressure from p∞to the critical value, p∞c, where from Equations
(2.45) and (2.41) it follows that
p∞c = pV −4S

which is often called the Blake threshold pressure.

The isothermal case (k = 1) is presented graphically in Figure 2.4 where
the solid lines represent equilibrium conditions for a bubble of size RE plotted
against the tension (pV −p∞) for various ﬁxed masses of gas in the bubble and
a ﬁxed surface tension. The critical radius for any particular mG corresponds to
the maximum in each curve. The locus of the peaks is the graph of RC values and
is shown by the dashed line whose equation is (pV −p∞) = 4S/3RE. The region
to the right of the dashed line represents unstable equilibrium conditions. This
graphical representation was used by Daily and Johnson (1956) and is useful in
visualizing the quasistatic response of a bubble when subjected to a decreasing
pressure. Starting in the fourth quadrant under conditions in which the ambient
pressure p∞> pV , and assuming the mass of gas in the bubble is constant, the
radius RE will ﬁrst increase as (pV −p∞) increases.
The bubble will pass
through a series of stable equilibrium states until the particular critical pressure
corresponding to the maximum is reached. Any slight decrease in p∞below
the value corresponding to this point will result in explosive cavitation growth
regardless of whether p∞is further decreased or not. Indeed, it is clear from this
analysis that the critical tension for a liquid should be given by 4S/3R rather
than 2S/R as maintained in Chapter 1, since stable equilibrium conditions do
not exist in the range
4S
3R < (pV −p∞) < 2S
R
(2.47)
Other questions arise from inspection of Figure 2.4.
Note that for a given
subcritical tension two alternate equilibrium states exist, one smaller stable
state and one larger unstable state.
Suppose that a bubble at the smaller
stable state is also subjected to pressure oscillations of suﬃcient magnitude
to cause the bubble to momentarily exceed the size, RC. It would then grow
explosively without bound. This eﬀect is important in understanding the role
of turbulence in cavitation inception or the response of a liquid to an acoustic
ﬁeld (see Chapter 4).
This stability phenomenon has important consequences in many cavitating
ﬂows. To recognize this, one must visualize a spectrum of sizes of cavitation
nuclei being convected into a region of low pressure within the ﬂow. Then the p∞
in Equations (2.41) and (2.47) will be the local pressure in the liquid surrounding
the bubble, and p∞must be less than pV for explosive cavitation growth to
occur. It is clear from the above analysis that all of the nuclei whose size, R,
is greater than some critical value will become unstable, grow explosively, and
cavitate, whereas those nuclei smaller than that critical size will react passively
and will therefore not become visible to the eye. Though the actual response
of the bubble is dynamic and p∞is changing continuously, we can nevertheless
anticipate that the crtical nuclei size will be given approximately by 4S/3(pV −
p∞)∗where (pV −p∞)∗is some representative measure of the tension in the
low-pressure region. Note that the lower the pressure level, p∞, the smaller
the critical size and the larger the number of nuclei that are activated. This
accounts for the increase in the number of bubbles observed in a cavitating ﬂow
as the pressure is reduced.
A quantitative example of this eﬀect is shown in Figure 2.5, which presents

Figure 2.5: The maximum size, RM, to which a cavitation bubble grows accord-
ing to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation as a function of the original nucleus size,
Ro, and the cavitation number, σ, in the ﬂow around an axisymmetric head-

and Brennen 1991).
results from the integration of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for bubbles in the
ﬂow around an axisymmetric headform. It shows the maximum size which the
bubbles achieve as a function of the size of the original nucleus for a typical
Weber number, ρLRHU 2
∞/S, of 28,000 where U∞and RH are the free stream
velocity and headform radius.
Data are plotted for four diﬀerent cavitation
numbers, σ, representing diﬀerent ambient pressure levels. Note that the curves
for σ < 0.5 all have abrupt vertical sections at certain critical nuclei sizes and
that this critical size decreases with decreasing σ. Numerical results for this
and other ﬂows show that the critical size, RC, adheres fairly closely to the
nondimensional version of the expression derived earlier,
RC ≈κS/ρLU 2
∞(−σ −Cpmin)
(2.48)
where Cpmin is the minimum pressure coeﬃcient in the ﬂow and the factor κ is
close to unity.
Note also from Figure 2.5 that, whatever their initial size, all unstable nuclei
grow to roughly the same maximum size. This is because both the asymptotic
growth rate and the time available for growth are relatively independent of the

size of the original nucleus.
From Equation (2.33) the growth rate is given
approximately by
dR
dt = U∞(−σ −Cpmin)

(2.49)
Moreover, if the pressure near the minimum pressure point is represented by
Cp = Cpmin + Cp∗(s/RH)2
(2.50)
where s is a coordinate measured along the surface, RH is the typical dimension
of the body, and Cp∗is a constant which is typically of order one, then the
typical time available for growth, tG, is given approximately by
tG = 2RH(−σ −Cpmin)

(2.52)
and therefore only changes modestly with cavitation number within the range
of signiﬁcance.
2.6
GROWTH BY MASS DIFFUSION
In most of the circumstances considered in this chapter, it is assumed that
the events occur too rapidly for signiﬁcant mass transfer of contaminant gas to
occur between the bubble and the liquid. Thus we assumed in Section 2.3 and
elsewhere that the mass of contaminant gas in the bubble remained constant. It
is convenient to reconsider this issue at this point, for the methods of analysis of
mass diﬀusion will clearly be similar to those of thermal diﬀusion (Scriven 1959).
Moreover, there are some issues that require analysis of the rate of increase or
decrease of the mass of gas in the bubble. One of the most basic issues is the fact
that any and all of the gas-ﬁlled microbubbles that are present in a subsaturated
liquid (and particularly in water) should dissolve away if the ambient pressure
is suﬃciently high. Henry’s law states that the partial pressure of gas, pGE, in
the bubble, which is in equilibrium with a saturated concentration , c∞, of gas
dissolved in the liquid will be given by
pGE = Hc∞
(2.53)
where H is Henry’s law constant for that gas and liquid combination. (Note
that H decreases substantially with temperature.) Consequently, if the ambient
pressure, p∞, is greater than (Hc∞+ pV −2S/R), the bubble should dissolve
away completely. As we discussed in Section 1.12, experience is contrary to this
theory, and microbubbles persist even when the liquid is subjected to several
atmospheres of pressure for an extended period.

The process of mass transfer can be analysed by noting that the concentra-
tion, c(r, t), of gas in the liquid will be governed by a diﬀusion equation identical
in form to Equation (2.15),
∂c
∂t + dR

R
r
2 ∂c
∂r = D
r2
∂


r2 ∂c


(2.54)
where D is the mass diﬀusivity, typically 2 × 10−5 cm2/sec for air in water
at normal temperatures. As Plesset and Prosperetti (1977) demonstrate, the
typical bubble growth rates due to mass diﬀusion are so slow that the convection
term (the second term on the left-hand side of Equation (2.54)) is negligible.
The simplest problem is that of a bubble of radius, R, in a liquid at a ﬁxed
ambient pressure, p∞, and gas concentration, c∞. In the absence of inertial
eﬀects the partial pressure of gas in the bubble will be pGE where
pGE = p∞−pV + 2S/R
(2.55)
and therefore the concentration of gas at the liquid interface is cS = pGE/H.
Epstein and Plesset (1950) found an approximate solution to the problem of a
bubble in a liquid initially at uniform gas concentration, c∞, at time, t = 0,
which takes the form
RdR
dt = D
ρG
[c∞−cS(1 + 2S/Rp∞)]
(1 + 4S/3Rp∞)

1 + R(πDt)−1
2

(2.56)
where ρG is the density of gas in the bubble and cS is the saturated concen-
tration at the interface at the partial pressure given by Equation (2.55) (the
vapor pressure is neglected in their analysis). The last term in Equation (2.56),
R(πDt)−1
2 , arises from a growing diﬀusion boundary layer in the liquid at the
bubble surface. This layer grows like (Dt)
1
2 . When t is large, the last term in
Equation (2.56) becomes small and the characteristic growth is given approxi-
mately by
[R(t)]2 −[R(0)]2 ≈2D(c∞−cS)t
ρG
(2.57)
where, for simplicity, we have neglected surface tension.
It is instructive to evaluate the typical duration of growth (or shrinkage).
From Equation (2.57) the time required for complete solution is tCS where
tCS ≈
ρG [R(0)]2
2D(cS −c∞)
(2.58)
Typical values of (cS −c∞)/ρG of 0.01 (Plesset and Prosperetti 1977) coupled
with the value of D given above lead to complete solution of a 10µm bubble in
about 2.5s. Though short, this is a long time by the standards of most bubble
dynamic phenomena.
The fact that a microbubble should dissolve within seconds leaves unresolved
the question of why cavitation nuclei persist indeﬁnitely. One possible explana-
tion is that the interface is immobilized by the eﬀects of surface contamination.

Another is that the bubble is imbedded in a solid particle in a way that in-
hibits the solution of the gas, the so-called Harvey nucleus. These issues were
discussed previously in Section 1.12.
Finally we note that there is an important mass diﬀusion eﬀect caused by
ambient pressure oscillations in which nonlinearities can lead to bubble growth
even in a subsaturated liquid.
This is known as “rectiﬁed diﬀusion” and is
discussed later in Section 4.9.
2.7
THERMAL EFFECTS ON GROWTH
In Sections 2.4 through 2.6 some of the characteristics of bubble dynamics in
the absence of thermal eﬀects were explored. It is now necessary to examine
the regime of validity of these analyses, and it is convenient to ﬁrst evaluate the
magnitude of the thermal term (2.24) which was neglected in Equation (2.12)
in order to produce Equation (2.27).
First examine the case of bubble growth. The asymptotic growth rate given
by Equation (2.33) is constant and hence in the characteristic case of a constant
p∞, terms (1), (3), (4), (5), and (6) in Equation (2.12) are all either constant or
diminishing in magnitude as time progresses. Furthermore, a constant, asymp-
totic growth rate corresponds to the case
n = 1
;
R∗= {2(pV −p∗
∞)/3ρL}
1
2
(2.59)
in Equation (2.21). Consequently, according to Equation (2.24), the thermal
term (2) in its linearized form for small (T∞−TB) will be given by
term(2) = Σ(T∞)C(1)R∗t
1
2
(2.60)
Under these conditions, even if the thermal term is initially negligible, it will
gain in magnitude relative to all the other terms and will ultimately aﬀect the
growth in a major way. Parenthetically it should be added that the Plesset-
Zwick assumption of a small thermal boundary layer thickness, δT , relative
to R can be shown to hold throughout the inertially controlled growth period
since δT increases like (αLt)
1
2 whereas R is increasing linearly with t.
Only
under circumstances of very slow growth might the assumption be violated.
Using the relation (2.60), one can deﬁne a critical time, tc1 (called the ﬁrst
critical time), during the growth when the order of magnitude of term (2) be-
comes equal to the order of magnitude of the retained terms, as represented by
( ˙R)2. This ﬁrst critical time is given by
tc1 = (pV −p∗
∞)

(2.61)
where the constants of order unity have been omitted for clarity.
Thus tc1

calling Equation (2.25),
Σ(T) =

(2.62)
it can be anticipated that Σ2 will change by many, many orders of magnitude
in a given liquid as the temperature T∞is varied from the triple point to the
critical point since Σ2 is proportional to (ρV /ρL)4. As a result the critical time,
tc1, will vary by many orders of magnitude. Some values of Σ for a number of
liquids are plotted in Figure 2.6 as a function of the reduced temperature T/TC
and in Figure 2.7 as a function of the vapor pressure. As an example, consider a
typical cavitating ﬂow experiment in a water tunnel with a tension of the order
of 104 kg/m s2. Since water at 20◦C has a value of Σ of about 1 m/s
3
2 , the ﬁrst

liquids as a function of the vapor pressure (in kg/m s2).
critical time is of the order of 10s, which is very much longer than the time of
growth of bubbles. Hence the bubble growth occurring in this case is unhindered
by thermal eﬀects; it is “inertially controlled” growth. If, on the other hand,
the tunnel water were heated to 100◦C or, equivalently, one observed bubble
growth in a pot of boiling water at superheat of 2◦K, then since Σ ≈103 m/s
3
2
at 100◦C the ﬁrst critical time would be 10µs. Thus virtually all the bubble
growth observed would be “thermally controlled.”
2.8
THERMALLY CONTROLLED GROWTH
When the ﬁrst critical time is exceeded it is clear that the relative importance
of the various terms in the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation, (2.12), will change. The
most important terms become the driving term (1) and the thermal term (2)
whose magnitude is much larger than that of the inertial terms (4). Hence if

the tension (pV −p∗
∞) remains constant, then the solution using the form of
Equation (2.24) for the thermal term must have n =

behavior is

Consequently, as time proceeds, the inertial, viscous, gaseous, and surface ten-
sion terms in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation all rapidly decline in importance.

(2.64)
where the group ρLcPL∆T/ρV L is termed the Jakob Number in the context of
pool boiling and ∆T = TW −T∞, TW being the wall temperature.
The result, Equation (2.63), demonstrates that the rate of growth of the
bubble decreases substantially after the ﬁrst critical time, tc1, is reached and
that R subsequently increases like t
1
2 instead of t. Moreover, since the thermal
boundary layer also increases like (αLt)
1
2 , the Plesset-Zwick assumption remains
valid indeﬁnitely.
An example of this thermally inhibited bubble growth is
including in Figure 2.8, which is taken from Dergarabedian (1953). We observe
that the experimental data and calculations using the Plesset-Zwick method
agree quite well.
When bubble growth is caused by decompression so that p∞(t) changes sub-
stantially with time during growth, the simple approximate solution of Equation

(2.63) no longer holds and the analysis of the unsteady thermal boundary layer
surrounding the bubble becomes considerably more complex. One must then
solve the diﬀusion Equation (2.15), the energy equation (usually in the ap-
proximate form of Equation (2.17)) and the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.12)
simultaneously, though for the thermally controlled growth being considered
here, most of the terms in Equation (2.12) become negligible so that the sim-
pliﬁcation, pV (TB) = p∞(t), is usually justiﬁed. When p∞is a constant this
reduces to the problem treated by Plesset and Zwick (1952) and later addressed
by Forster and Zuber (1954) and Scriven (1959). Several diﬀerent approximate
solutions to the general problem of thermally controlled bubble growth dur-
ing liquid decompression have been put forward by Theofanous et al. (1969),
Jones and Zuber (1978) and Cha and Henry (1981). Theofanous et al. include
nonequilibrium thermodynamic eﬀects on which we comment in the following
section. If these are ignored, then all three analyses yield qualitatively similar
results which also agree quite well with the experimental data of Hewitt and
Parker (1968) for bubble growth in liquid nitrogen. Figure 2.9 presents a typi-
cal example of the data of Hewitt and Parker and a comparison with the three
analytical treatments mentioned above.
Several other factors can complicate and alter the dynamics of thermally con-
trolled growth, and these are discussed in the sections which follow. Nonequilib-
rium eﬀects are addressed in Section 2.9. More important are the modiﬁcations
to the heat transfer mechanisms at the bubble surface that can be caused by sur-
face instabilities or by convective heat transfer. These are reviewed in Sections
2.10 and 2.12.
2.9
NONEQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS
One factor that could aﬀect the dynamics of thermally controlled growth is
whether or not the liquid at the interface is in thermal equilibrium with the
vapor in the bubble. Most of the analyses assume that the temperature of the
liquid at the interface, TLS, is the temperature of the saturated vapor in the
bubble, TB. Theofanous et al. (1969) have suggested that this might not be
the case because of the high evaporation rate. They employ an accommodation
coeﬃcient, Λ, deﬁned (Schrage 1953) by
GV = Λ

(2.65)
where GV is the evaporative mass ﬂux and KV is the gas constant of the vapor.
For a chosen value of Λ this eﬀectively deﬁnes a temperature discontinuity at the
interface. Clearly Λ = ∞corresponds to the previously assumed equilibrium
condition. Plesset and Prosperetti (1977) demonstrate that if Λ is of order unity
then the nonequilibrium correction is of the order of the Mach number of the
bubble wall motion and is therefore negligible except, perhaps, near the end of
a violent bubble collapse (see Fujikawa and Akamatsu 1980 and Section 3.2).

Figure 2.9: Data from Hewitt and Parker (1968) on the growth of a vapor bubble
in liquid nitrogen (pressure/time history also shown) and comparison with the
analytical treatments by Theofanous et al. (1969), Jones and Zuber (1978), and
Cha and Henry (1981).
On the other hand, if Λ is much smaller than unity, signiﬁcant nonequilibrium
eﬀects might be encountered.
Theofanous et al. (1969) explore the eﬀects of small values of Λ theoretically.
They conﬁrm that values of order unity do not yield bubble histories that diﬀer
by very much from those that assume equilibrium. Values of Λ of the order of
0.01 did produce substantial diﬀerences. However, the results using equilibrium
appear to compare favorably with the experimental results as shown in Figure
2.9. This suggests that nonequilibrium eﬀects have little eﬀect on thermally
controlled bubble growth though the issue is not entirely settled since some
studies do suggest that values of Λ as low as 0.01 may be possible.
2.10
CONVECTIVE EFFECTS
Another way in which the rate of heat transfer to the interface may be changed
is by convection caused by relative motion between the bubble and the liquid.

Such enhancement of the heat transfer rate is normally represented by a Nus-
selt number, Nu, deﬁned as the ratio of the actual heat transfer rate divided
by the rate of heat transfer by conduction. Therefore in the present context
the factor, Nu, should be included as a multiplier in the thermal term of the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Then one seeks a relationship between Nu and the
Peclet number, P e = WR/αL, where W is the typical translational velocity
of the bubble relative to the liquid. The appropriate relationship for a growing
and translating bubble is not known; analytically this represents a problem that
is substantially more complex than that tackled by Plesset and Zwick. Never-
theless, it is of interest to speculate on the form of Nu(P e) and observe the
consequences for the bubble growth rate. Therefore let us assume that this re-
lationship takes the approximate form common in many convective heat transfer
problems:
Nu =
1
for P e ≪1
=
CP em
for P e ≫1
(2.66)
where C is some constant of order unity. We must also decide on the form of
the relative velocity, W, which could have several causes. In either a cavitating
ﬂow or in pool boiling it could be due to pressure gradients within the liquid
due to acceleration of the liquid. It could also be caused by the presence of
nearby solid boundaries.
Despite the diﬃculties of accurate assessment of the convective heat trans-
fer eﬀects, let us consider the qualitative eﬀects of two possible translational
motions on a bubble growing like R = R∗tn. The ﬁrst eﬀect is that due to
buoyancy; the relative velocity, W, caused by buoyancy in the absence of vis-
cous drag will be given by W ∝gt with a factor of proportionality of order one.
The viscous drag on the bubble will have little eﬀect so long as νLt ≪R2. The
second example is a bubble growing on a solid wall where the eﬀective convec-
tive velocity is roughly given by dR/dt and hence W ∝R∗tn−1. Thus the Peclet
numbers for the two cases are respectively
R∗gtn+1
αL
and
(R∗)2t2n−1
αL
(2.67)
Consider ﬁrst the case of inertially controlled growth for which n = 1. Then
it follows that convective heat transfer eﬀects will only occur for P e ≥1 or for
times t > tc2 where
tc2 =

ρLα2

 1
4
and
αLρL
(pV −p∗∞)
(2.68)
respectively where the asymptotic growth rate given by Equation (2.33) has
been used. Consequently, the convective enhancement of the heat transfer will
only occur during the inertially controlled growth if tc2 < tc1 and this requires
that
pV −p∗
∞> ρL
Σ4αL

ρL(Σ2αL)

(2.69)

respectively. Since Σ increases rapidly with temperature it is much more likely
that these inequalities will be true at low reduced temperatures than at high
reduced temperatures. For example, in water at 20◦C the right-hand sides of
Inequality (2.69) are respectively 30 and 4 kg/msec2, very small tensions (and
correspondingly minute superheats) that could readily occur. If the tension is
larger than this critical value, then convective eﬀects would become important.
On the other hand, in water at 100◦C the values are respectively equivalent to
superheats of 160◦K and 0.5◦K, which are less likely to occur.
It follows that in each of the two bubble motions assumed there is some
temperature below which one would expect P e to reach unity prior to tc1. The
question is what happens thereafter, for clearly the thermal eﬀect that would
otherwise begin at tc1 is now going to be altered by the enhanced heat transfer.
When P e > 1 the thermal term in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation will no longer
grow like t
1
2 but will increase like t
1
2 /Nu which, according to the relations (2.67),
is like t

2 −2m and t
1
2 −m for the two bubble motions. If, as in many convective
heat transfer problems, m = 1
2, it would follow that thermal inhibition of the
growth would be eliminated and the inertially controlled growth would continue
indeﬁnitely.
Finally, consider the other possible scenario in which convective heat trans-
fer eﬀects might inﬂuence the thermally controlled growth in the event that
tc2 > tc1. Given n = 1

become unity at

using Equation (2.63). Consequently, convective heat transfer could alter the
form of the thermally controlled growth after t = tc3; indeed, it is possible
that inertially controlled growth could resume after tc3 if m > 1
4. In the other
example of bubble growth at a wall, the Peclet number would remain at the value
less than unity which it had attained at tc1. Consequently, the convective heat
transfer eﬀects would delay the onset of thermally inhibited growth indeﬁnitely

or form of the thermally controlled growth if the reverse were true.
2.11
SURFACE ROUGHENING EFFECTS
Another important phenomenon that can aﬀect the heat transfer process at the
interface during bubble growth (and therefore aﬀect the bubble growth rate) is
the development of an instability on the interface. If the bubble surface becomes
rough and turbulent, the increase in the eﬀective surface area and the unsteady
motions of the liquid near that surface can lead to a substantial enhancement
of the rate of heat transfer to the interface. The eﬀect is to delay (perhaps even
indeﬁnitely) the point at which the rate of growth is altered by thermal eﬀects.
This is one possible explanation for the phenomenon of vapor explosions which
are essentially the result of an extended period of inertially controlled bubble

growth.
Shepherd and Sturtevant (1982) and Frost and Sturtevant (1986) have exam-
ined rapidly growing nucleation bubbles near the limit of superheat and have
found growth rates substantially larger than expected when the bubble was
in the thermally controlled growth phase. The experiments examined bubble
growth within droplets of superheated liquid suspended in another immiscible
liquid. Typical photographs are shown in Figure 2.10 and reveal that the sur-
faces of the bubbles are rough and irregular.
The enhancement of the heat
transfer caused by this roughening is probably responsible for the larger growth
rates. Shepherd and Sturtevant (1982) attribute the roughness to the devel-
opment of a baroclinic interfacial instability similar to the Landau-Darrieus
instability of ﬂame fronts. It is also of interest to note that Frost and Sturte-
vant report that the instability could be suppressed by increasing the ambient
pressure and therefore the temperature and density within the bubble. At an
ambient pressure of 2 bar, the onset of the instability could be observed on
the surface of ether bubbles and was accompanied by a jump in the radiated
pressure associated with the sudden acceleration in the growth rate. At higher
ambient pressures the instability could be completely suppressed. This occurs
because the growth rate of the instability increases with the rate of growth of
the bubble, and both are signiﬁcantly reduced at the higher ambient pressures.
It may be that, under other circumstances, the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities
described in Section 2.12 could give rise to a similar eﬀect.
2.12
NONSPHERICAL PERTURBATIONS
Apart from the phenomena described in the preceding section, it has, thus far,
been tacitly assumed that the bubble remains spherical during the growth or
collapse process; in other words, it has been assumed that the bubble is stable

mass; the droplet is clear and transparent.

diﬀerent events, were taken 31, 44, and 58 µs after nucleation and the droplets

to nonspherical distortions. There are, however, circumstances in which this is
not true, and the subsequent departure from a smooth spherical shape can have
important practical consequences.
The stability to nonspherical disturbances has been investigated from a
purely hydrodynamic point of view by Birkhoﬀ(1954) and Plesset and Mitchell
(1956), among others. These analyses essentially examine the spherical equiv-
alent of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability; they do not include thermal eﬀects. If
the inertia of the gas in the bubble is assumed to be negligible, then the ampli-
tude, a(t), of a spherical harmonic distortion of order n (n > 1) will be governed
by the equation:

The coeﬃcients require knowledge of the global dynamic behavior, R(t).
It
is clear from this equation that the most unstable circumstances occur when
˙R < 0 and ¨R ≥0 (where overdots denote diﬀerentiation with respect to time,
t). These conditions will be met just prior to the rebound of a collapsing cavity.
On the other hand, the most stable circumstances occur when ˙R > 0 and ¨R < 0,
which is the case for growing bubbles as they approach their maximum size.
The fact that the coeﬃcients in Equation (2.71) are not constant in time
causes departure from the equivalent Rayleigh-Taylor instability for a plane
boundary. The coeﬃcient of a is not greatly dissimilar from the case of the
plane boundary in the sense that instability is promoted when ¨R > 0 and
surface tension has a stabilizing eﬀect.
The primary diﬀerence is caused by

Figure 2.12: The orders of the spherical harmonic disturbances that, during
bubble growth, produce (i) the maximum disturbance amplitude (nA) and (ii)

the da/dt term, which can be interpreted as a geometric eﬀect. As the bubble
grows the wavelength on the surface increases, and hence the growth of the wave
amplitude is lessened. The reverse occurs during collapse.
Plesset and Mitchell (1956) examined the particular case of a vapor/gas
bubble initially in equilibrium that is subjected to a step function change in the
pressure at inﬁnity. Thermal and viscous eﬀects are assumed to be negligible.
The eﬀect of a ﬁxed mass of gas in the bubble will be included in this presen-
tation though it was omitted by Plesset and Mitchell. Note that this simple
growth problem for a spherical bubble was solved for R(t) in Section 2.4. One
feature of that solution that is important in this context is that ¨R ≥0. It is
this feature that gives rise to the instability. However, in any real scenario, the
initial acceleration phase for which ¨R ≥0 is of limited duration, so the issue
will be whether or not the instability has suﬃcient time during the acceleration
phase for signiﬁcant growth to occur.
It transpires that it is more convenient to rewrite Equation (2.71) using

plitude to bubble radius, (a/y)max, for spherical harmonic disturbances on the

represent the eﬀects of surface tension and gas content respectively. Note that
a positive value of
(pV −p∞)(1 −β1 + β2)
(2.77)
implies bubble growth following t = 0 whereas a negative value implies collapse.
Some typical numerical integrations of Equation (2.72) in cases of bubble
growth are shown in Figure 2.11 where the amplitude scale is arbitrary. Plesset
and Mitchell performed hand calculations for small n and found only minor
ampliﬁcation during growth. However, as can be anticipated from Equation
(2.72), the amplitudes may be much larger for large n. It can be seen from
Figure 2.11 that the amplitude of the disturbance reaches a peak and then
decays during growth.
For given values of the parameters β1 and β2, there
exists a particular spherical harmonic, n = nA, which achieves the maximum
amplitude, a; in Figure 2.11 we chose to display data for n values which bracket
nA. The dependence of nA on β1 and β2 is shown in Figure 2.12. A slightly
diﬀerent value of n denoted by nB gives the maximum value of a/y. Since the
latter quantity rather than a represents a measure of the wave amplitude to
wavelength ratio, Figure 2.12 also shows the dependence of nB on β1 and β2.
To complete the picture, Figure 2.13 presents values of (a)max, (a/y)max and
the sizes of the bubble (y)a=max and (y)a/y=max at which these maxima occur.
In summary, it can be seen that the initial acceleration phase of bubble
growth in which ¨R ≥0 is unstable to spherical harmonic perturbations of fairly
high order, n. On the other hand, visual inspection of Equation (2.71) is suﬃ-
cient to conclude that the remainder of the growth phase during which ˙R > 0,
¨R < 0 is stable to all spherical harmonic perturbations. So, if inadequate time is
available for growth of the perturbations during the acceleration phase, then the
bubble will remain unperturbed throughout its growth. In their experiments on
underwater explosions, Reynolds and Berthoud (1981) observed bubble surface
instabilities during the acceleration phase that did correspond to fairly large n
of the order of 10. They also evaluate the duration of the acceleration phase in
their experiments and demonstrate, using an estimated growth rate, that this
phase is long enough for signiﬁcant roughening of the surface to occur. How-
ever, their bubbles become smooth again in the second, deceleration phase of
growth. The bubbles examined by Reynolds and Berthoud were fairly large,
2.5 cm to 4.5 cm in radius. A similar acceleration phase instability has not, to
the author’s knowledge, been reported for the smaller bubbles typical of most
cavitation experiments. This could either be the result of a briefer acceleration
phase or the greater stabilizing eﬀect of surface tension in smaller bubbles.

CAVITATION BUBBLE
COLLAPSE
3.1
INTRODUCTION
In the preceding chapter some of the equations of bubble dynamics were devel-
oped and applied to problems of bubble growth. In this chapter we continue
the discussion of bubble dynamics but switch attention to the dynamics of col-
lapse and, in particular, consider the consequences of the violent collapse of
vapor-ﬁlled cavitation bubbles.
3.2
BUBBLE COLLAPSE
Bubble collapse is a particularly important subject because of the noise and ma-
terial damage that can be caused by the high velocities, pressures, and temper-
atures that may result from that collapse. The analysis of Section 2.4 allowed
approximate evaluation of the magnitudes of those velocities, pressures, and
temperatures (Equations (2.36), (2.38), (2.39)) under a number of assumptions
including that the bubble remains spherical. It will be shown in Section 3.5
that collapsing bubbles do not remain spherical. Moreover, as we shall see in
Chapter 7, bubbles that occur in a cavitating ﬂow are often far from spherical.
However, it is often argued that the spherical analysis represents the maximum
possible consequences of bubble collapse in terms of the pressure, temperature,
noise, or damage potential. Departure from sphericity can diﬀuse the focus of
the collapse and reduce the maximum pressures and temperatures that might
result.
When a cavitation bubble grows from a small nucleus to many times its
original size, the collapse will begin at a maximum radius, RM, with a partial
pressure of gas, pGM, which is very small indeed. In a typical cavitating ﬂow
RM is of the order of 100 times the original nuclei size, Ro. Consequently, if

radius (relative to the initial radius) for a pressure diﬀerence, p∞−pGM, of
0.517 bar. Results are shown for the incompressible analysis and for the methods
of Herring (1941) and Gilmore (1952).
Schneider’s (1949) numerical results
closely follow Gilmore’s curve up to a Mach number of 2.2.
the original partial pressure of gas in the nucleus was about 1 bar the value of
pGM at the start of collapse would be about 10−6 bar. If the typical pressure
depression in the ﬂow yields a value for (p∗
∞−p∞(0)) of, say, 0.1 bar it would
follow from Equation (2.38) that the maximum pressure generated would be
about 1010 bar and the maximum temperature would be 4 × 104 times the
ambient temperature!
Many factors, including the diﬀusion of gas from the
liquid into the bubble and the eﬀect of liquid compressibility, mitigate this
result. Nevertheless, the calculation illustrates the potential for the generation
of high pressures and temperatures during collapse and the potential for the
generation of shock waves and noise.
Early work on collapse focused on the inclusion of liquid compressibility in
order to learn more about the production of shock waves. Herring (1941) in-
troduced the ﬁrst-order correction for liquid compressibility assuming the Mach
number of collapse motion, |dR/dt|/c, was much less than unity and neglecting
any noncondensable gas or thermal eﬀects so that the pressure in the bubble
remains constant. Later, Schneider (1949) treated the same, highly idealized
problem by numerically solving the equations of compressible ﬂow up to the
point where the Mach number of collapse, |dR/dt|/c, was about 2.2. Gilmore
(1952) (see also Trilling 1952) showed that one could use the approximation in-
troduced by Kirkwood and Bethe (1942) to obtain analytic solutions that agreed
with Schneider’s numerical results up to that Mach number. Parenthetically we

note that the Kirkwood-Bethe approximation assumes that wave propagation in
the liquid occurs at sonic speed, c, relative to the liquid velocity, u, or, in other
words, at c + u in the absolute frame (see also Flynn 1966). Figure 3.1 presents
some of the results obtained by Herring (1941), Schneider (1949), and Gilmore
(1952). It demonstrates how, in the idealized problem, the Mach number of
the bubble surface increases as the bubble radius decreases. The line marked
“incompressible” corresponds to the case in which the compressibility of the
liquid has been neglected in the equation of motion (see Equation (2.36)). The
slope is approximately −3/2 since |dR/dt| ∝R−3
2 . Note that compressibility
tends to lessen the velocity of collapse.
We note that Benjamin (1958) also
investigated analytical solutions to this problem at higher Mach numbers for
which the Kirkwood-Bethe approximation becomes quite inaccurate.
When the bubble contains some noncondensable gas or when thermal eﬀects
become important, the solution becomes more complex since the pressure in the
bubble is no longer constant. Under these circumstances it would clearly be very
useful to ﬁnd some way of incorporating the eﬀects of liquid compressibility in a
modiﬁed version of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Keller and Kolodner (1956)
proposed the following modiﬁed form in the absence of thermal, viscous, or
surface tension eﬀects:

where pc(t) denotes the variable part of the pressure in the liquid at the loca-
tion of the bubble center in the absence of the bubble. Other forms have been
suggested and the situation has recently been reviewed by Prosperetti and Lezzi
(1986), who show that a number of the suggested equations are equally valid
in that they are all accurate to the ﬁrst or linear order in the Mach number,
|dR/dt|/c. They also demonstrate that such modiﬁed Rayleigh-Plesset equa-
tions are quite accurate up to Mach numbers of the order of 0.3. At higher
Mach numbers the compressible liquid ﬁeld equations must be solved numeri-
cally.
However, as long as there is some gas present to decelerate the collapse,
the primary importance of liquid compressibility is not the eﬀect it has on the
bubble dynamics (which is slight) but the role it plays in the formation of shock
waves during the rebounding phase that follows collapse. Hickling and Plesset
(1964) were the ﬁrst to make use of numerical solutions of the compressible
ﬂow equations to explore the formation of pressure waves or shocks during the
rebound phase. Figure 3.2 presents an example of their results for the pressure
distributions in the liquid before (left) and after (right) the moment of minimum
size. The graph on the right clearly shows the propagation of a pressure pulse
or shock away from the bubble following the minimum size. As indicated in
that ﬁgure, Hickling and Plesset concluded that the pressure pulse exhibits
approximately geometric attentuation (like r−1) as it propagates away from

tributions in the liquid before collapse (left) and after collapse (right) (without
viscosity or surface tension). The parameters are p∞= 1 bar, γ = 1.4, and the
initial pressure in the bubble was 10−3 bar. The values attached to each curve
are proportional to the time before or after the minimum size.
the bubble. Other numerical calculations have since been carried out by Ivany
and Hammitt (1965), Tomita and Shima (1977), and Fujikawa and Akamatsu
(1980), among others. Ivany and Hammitt (1965) conﬁrmed that neither surface
tension nor viscosity play a signiﬁcant role in the problem. Eﬀects investigated
by others will be discussed in the following section.
These later works are in accord with the ﬁndings of Hickling and Plesset
(1964) insofar as the development of a pressure pulse or shock is concerned. It
appears that, in most cases, the pressure pulse radiated into the liquid has a
peak pressure amplitude, pP , which is given roughly by
pP ≈100RMp∞/r
(3.2)
Though Akulichev (1971) found much stronger attentuation in the far ﬁeld,
it seems clear that Equation (3.2) gives the order of magnitude of the strong
pressure pulse, which might impinge on a solid surface a few radii away. For
example, if p∞≈1 bar this implies a substantial pulse of 100 bar at a distance
of one maximum bubble radius away (at r = RM). Experimentally, Fujikawa
and Akamatsu (1980) found shock intensities at the wall of about 100 bar when
the collapsing bubble was about a maximum radius away from the wall. We
note that much higher pressures are momentarily experienced in the gas of the
bubble, but we shall delay discussion of this feature of the results until later.
All of these analyses assume spherical symmetry. Later we will focus atten-
tion on the stability of shape of a collapsing bubble before continuing discussion
of the origins of cavitation damage.

3.3
THERMALLY CONTROLLED COLLAPSE
Before examining thermal eﬀects during the last stages of collapse, it is im-
portant to recognize that bubbles could experience thermal eﬀects early in the
collapse in the same way as was discussed for growing bubbles in Section 2.7. As
one can anticipate, this would negate much of the discussion in the preceding
and following sections since if thermal eﬀects became important early in the
collapse phase, then the subsequent bubble dynamics would be of the benign,
thermally controlled type.
Consider a bubble of radius, Ro, initially at rest at time, t = 0, in liquid at
a pressure, p∞. Collapse is initiated by increasing the ambient liquid pressure
to p∗
∞. From the Rayleigh-Plesset equation the initial motion in the absence of
thermal eﬀects has the form
R/Ro = 1 −pct2 + 0(t3)
(3.3)
where pc is the collapse motivation deﬁned as
pc =
(p∗
∞−pV )

(3.4)
If this is substituted into the Plesset-Zwick Equation (2.20) to evaluate the
thermal term in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, one obtains a critical time tc4,
necessary for development of signiﬁcant thermal eﬀects given by
tc4 = (Ro/Σ)2/3
(3.5)
One problem with such an approach is that the Plesset-Zwick assumption of a
thermal boundary layer that is thin compared to R will be increasingly in danger
of being violated as the boundary layer thickens while the radius decreases.
Nevertheless, proceeding with the analysis, it follows that if tc4 ≪tT C where
tT C is the typical time for collapse (see Section 2.4), then thermally controlled
collapse will begin early in the collapse process. It follows that this condition
arises if

where the term in the square bracket is a simple constant of order unity. If
Inequality (3.6) is violated, then thermal eﬀects will not begin to become im-
portant until later in the collapse process.

3.4
THERMAL EFFECTS IN
BUBBLE COLLAPSE
Even if thermal eﬀects are negligible for most of the collapse phase, they play
a very important role in the ﬁnal stage of collapse when the bubble contents
are highly compressed by the inertia of the inrushing liquid. The pressures and
temperatures that are predicted to occur in the gas within the bubble during
spherical collapse are very high indeed. Since the elapsed times are so small (of
the order of microseconds), it would seem a reasonable approximation to assume
that the noncondensable gas in the bubble behaves adiabatically. Typical of the
adiabatic calculations is the work of Tomita and Shima (1977), who used the
accurate method for handling liquid compressiblity that was ﬁrst suggested by
Benjamin (1958) and obtained maximum gas temperatures as high as 8800◦K in
the bubble center. But, despite the small elapsed times, Hickling (1963) demon-
strated that heat transfer between the liquid and the gas is important because
of the extremely high temperature gradients and the short distances involved.
In later calculations Fujikawa and Akamatsu (1980) included heat transfer and,
for a case similar to that of Tomita and Shima, found lower maximum tem-
peratures and pressures of the order of 6700◦K and 848 bar respectively at
the bubble center. The gradients of temperature are such that the maximum
interface temperature is about 3400◦K. Furthermore, these temperatures and
pressures only exist for a fraction of a microsecond; for example, after 2 µs the
interface temperature dropped to 300◦K.
Fujikawa and Akamatsu (1980) also explored nonequilibrium condensation
eﬀects at the bubble wall which, they argued, could cause additional cushioning
of the collapse. They carried out calculations that included an accommodation
coeﬃcient similar to that deﬁned in Equation (2.65). As in the case of bubble
growth studied by Theofanous et al. (1969), Fujikawa and Akamatsu showed
that an accommodation coeﬃcient, Λ, of the order of unity had little eﬀect.
Accommodation coeﬃcients of the order of 0.01 were required to observe any
signiﬁcant eﬀect; as we commented in Section 2.9, it is as yet unclear whether
such small accommodation coeﬃcients would occur in practice.
Other eﬀects that may be important are the interdiﬀusion of gas and vapor
within the bubble, which could cause a buildup of noncondensable gas at the
interface and therefore create a barrier which through the vapor must diﬀuse
in order to condense on the interface. Matsumoto and Watanabe (1989) have
examined a similar eﬀect in the context of oscillating bubbles.

Section 2.4 we will distinguish between the two important stages of the motion
excluding the initial inward acceleration transient. These are

1. the asymptotic form of the collapse in which ˙R ∝R−3
2 , which occurs prior
to signiﬁcant compression of the gas content, and
2. the rebound stage, in which the acceleration, ¨R, reverses sign and takes a
very large positive value.
The stability characteristics of these two stages are very diﬀerent. The calcula-
tions of Plesset and Mitchell (1956) showed that a bubble in an inﬁnite medium
would only be mildly unstable during the ﬁrst stage in which ¨R is negative;
disturbances would only grow at a slow rate due to geometric eﬀects. Note that
for small y, Equation (2.72) reduces to
d2a
dy2 + 3
2y
da
dy + (n −1) a
y2 = 0
(3.8)
which has oscillatory solutions in which the amplitude of a is proportional to
y−1
4 . This mild instability probably has little or no practical consequence.
On the the hand, it is clear from the theory that the bubble may become
highly unstable to nonspherical disturbances during stage two because ¨R reaches
very large positive values during this rebound phase. The instability appears to
manifest itself in several diﬀerent ways depending on the violence of the collapse
and the presence of other boundaries. All vapor bubbles that collapse to a size
orders of magnitude smaller than their maximum size inevitably emerge from
that collapse as a cloud of smaller bubbles rather than a single vapor bubble.
This fragmentation could be caused by a single microjet as described below,
or it could be due to a spherical harmonic disturbance of higher order. The
behavior of collapsing bubbles that are predominantly gas ﬁlled (or bubbles
whose collapse is thermally inhibited) is less certain since the lower values of
¨R in those cases make the instability weaker and, in some cases, could imply
spherical stability. Thus acoustically excited cavitation bubbles that contain
substantial gas often remain spherical during their rebound phase.
In other
instances the instability is suﬃcient to cause fragmentation. Several examples

of fragmented and highly distorted bubbles emerging from the rebound phase
are shown in Figure 3.3. These are from the experiments of Frost and Sturtevant
(1986), in which the thermal eﬀects are substantial.
A dominant feature in the collapse of many vapor bubbles is the development
of a reentrant jet (the n = 2 mode) due to an asymmetry such as the presence
of a nearby solid boundary. Such an asymmetry causes one side of the bubble
to accelerate inward more rapidly than the opposite side and this results in the
development of a high-speed re-entrant microjet which penetrates the bubble.
Such microjets were ﬁrst observed experimentally by Naude and Ellis (1961)
and Benjamin and Ellis (1966). Of particular interest for cavitation damage
is the fact that a nearby solid boundary will cause a microjet directed toward
that boundary. Figure 3.4, from Benjamin and Ellis (1966), shows the initial
formation of the microjet directed at a nearby wall. Other asymmetries, even
gravity, can cause the formation of these reentrant microjets. Figure 3.5 is one of
the very ﬁrst, if not the ﬁrst, photographs taken showing the result of a gravity-
produced upward jet having progressed through the bubble and penetrated into
the ﬂuid on the other side thus creating the spiky protuberance. Indeed, the
upward inclination of the wall-induced reentrant jet in Figure 3.4 is caused by
gravity. Figure 3.6 presents a comparison between the reentrant jet development
in a bubble collapsing near a solid wall as observed by Lauterborn and Bolle
(1975) and as computed by Plesset and Chapman (1971).
Another asymmetry that can cause the formation of a reentrant jet is the
proximity of other, neighboring bubbles in a ﬁnite cloud of bubbles. Then, as
Chahine and Duraiswami (1992) have shown in their numerical calculations,

the bubbles on the outer edge of such a cloud will tend to develop jets directed
toward the center of the cloud; an example is shown in Figure 3.7.
Other
manifestations include a bubble collapsing near a free surface, that produces a
reentrant jet directed away from the free surface (Chahine 1977). Indeed, there
exists a critical surface ﬂexibility separating the circumstances in which the
reentrant jet is directed away from rather than toward the surface. Gibson and
Blake (1982) demonstrated this experimentally and analytically and suggested
ﬂexible coatings or liners as a means of avoiding cavitation damage. It might
also be noted that depth charges rely for their destructive power on a reentrant
jet directed toward the submarine upon the collapse of the explosively generated
bubble.
Many other experimentalists have subsequently observed reentrant jets (or
“microjets”) in the collapse of cavitation bubbles near solid walls. The progress
of events seems to diﬀer somewhat depending on the initial distance of the
bubble center from the wall. When the bubble is initially spherical but close to
the wall, the typical development of the microjet is as illustrated in Figure 3.8,
a series of photographs taken by Tomita and Shima (1990). When the bubble
is further away from the wall, the later events are somewhat diﬀerent; another
set of photographs taken by Tomita and Shima (1990) is included as Figure 3.9

and shows the formation of two toroidal vortex bubbles (frame 11) after the
microjet has completed its penetration of the original bubble. Furthermore, the
photographs of Lauterborn and Bolle (1975) in which the bubbles are about a
diameter from the wall, show that the initial collapse is quite spherical and that
the reentrant jet penetrates the ﬂuid between the bubble and the wall as the
bubble is rebounding from the ﬁrst collapse. At this stage the appearance is
very similar to Figure 3.5 but with the protuberance directed at the wall.
On the other hand, when the initial bubble is much closer to the wall and
collapse begins from a spherical cap shape, the photographs (for example, Shima
et al. (1981) or Kimoto (1987)) show a bubble that “pancakes” down toward
the surface in a manner illustrated by Figure 3.10 taken from Benjamin and
Ellis (1966). In these circumstances it is diﬃcult to observe the microjet.
The reentrant jet phenomenon in a quiescent ﬂuid has been extensively stud-
ied analytically as well as experimentally. Plesset and Chapman (1971) numer-
ically calculated the distortion of an initially spherical bubble as it collapsed
close to a solid boundary and, as Figure 3.6 demonstrates, their proﬁles are in
good agreement with the experimental observations of Lauterborn and Bolle
(1975). Blake and Gibson (1987) review the current state of knowledge, partic-
ularly the analytical methods for solving for bubbles collapsing near a solid or
a ﬂexible surface.
When a bubble in a quiescent ﬂuid collapses near a wall, the reentrant jets
reach high speeds quite early in the collapse process and long before the volume
reaches a size at which, for example, liquid compressibility becomes important
(see Section 3.2). The speed of the reentrant jet, UJ, at the time it impacts the

opposite surface of the bubble has been shown to be given by
UJ = ξ(∆p/ρL)1/2
(3.9)
where ξ is a constant and ∆p is the diﬀerence between the remote pressure, which
would maintain the bubble at equilibrium at its maximum or initial radius, and
the remote pressure present during collapse. Gibson (1968) found that ξ = 7.6
ﬁt his experimental observations; Blake and Gibson (1987) indicate that ξ is a
function of ratio, ϱ, of the initial distance of the bubble center from the wall to
the initial radius and that ξ = 11.0 for ϱ = 1.5 and ξ = 8.6 for ϱ = 1.0. Voinov
and Voinov (1975) found that the value of ξ could be as high as 64 if the initial
bubble had a slightly eccentric shape.
Whether the bubble is ﬁssioned due to the disruption caused by the microjet
or by the eﬀects of the stage two instability, many of the experimental observa-
tions of bubble collapse (for example, those of Kimoto 1987) show that a bubble
emerges from the ﬁrst rebound not as a single bubble but as a cloud of smaller
bubbles.
Unfortunately, the events of the last moments of collapse occur so
rapidly that the experiments do not have the temporal resolution neccessary to
show the details of this ﬁssion process. The subsequent dynamical behavior of
the bubble cloud may be diﬀerent from that of a single bubble. For example, the
damping of the rebound and collapse cycles is greater than for a single bubble.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that virtually all of the observations
described above pertain to bubble collapse in an otherwise quiescent ﬂuid. A
bubble that grows and collapses in a ﬂow is subject to other deformations that
can signiﬁcantly alter the noise and damage potential of the collapse process.
In Chapter 7 this issue will be addressed further.
3.6
CAVITATION DAMAGE
Perhaps the most ubiqitous engineering problem caused by cavitation is the
material damage that cavitation bubbles can cause when they collapse in the
vicinity of a solid surface. Consequently, this subject has been studied quite
intensively for many years (see, for example, ASTM 1967; Thiruvengadam 1967,
1974; Knapp, Daily, and Hammitt 1970). The problem is a diﬃcult one because
it involves complicated unsteady ﬂow phenomena combined with the reaction
of the particular material of which the solid surface is made.
Though there
exist many empirical rules designed to help the engineer evaluate the potential
cavitation damage rate in a given application, there remain a number of basic
questions regarding the fundamental mechanisms involved.
In the preceding sections, we have seen that cavitation bubble collapse is
a violent process that generates highly localized, large-amplitude shock waves
(Section 3.2) and microjets (Section 3.5) in the ﬂuid at the point of collapse.
When this collapse occurs close to a solid surface, these intense disturbances gen-
erate highly localized and transient surface stresses. Repetition of this loading
due to repeated collapses causes local surface fatigue failure and the subsequent
detachment or ﬂaking oﬀof pieces of material. This is the generally accepted

explanation of cavitation damage. It is also consistent with the metallurgical
evidence of damage in harder materials. Figure 3.11 is a typical photograph of
localized cavitation damage on a pump blade. It usually has the jagged, crys-
talline appearance consistent with fatigue failure and is usually fairly easy to
distinguish from the erosion due to solid particles, which has a much smoother
appearance. With iron or steel, the eﬀects of corrosion often enhance the speed
of cavitation damage.
Parenthetically it should be noted that pits caused by individual bubble
collapses are often observed with soft materials, and the relative ease with which
this process can be studied experimentally has led to a substantial body of
research evidence for soft materials. Much of this literature implies that the
microjets cause the individual pits. However, it does not neccessarily follow
that the same mechanism causes the damage in harder materials.
Indeed, the issue of whether cavitation damage is caused by microjets or by
shock waves or by both has been debated for many years. In the 1940s and 1950s
the focus was on the shock waves generated by spherical bubble collapse. When
the phenomenon of the microjet was ﬁrst observed by Naude and Ellis (1961)
and Benjamin and Ellis (1966), the focus shifted to studies of the impulsive
pressures generated by these jets. But, even after the disruption caused by the
microjet, one is left with a remnant cloud of small bubbles that will continue
to collapse collectively. Though no longer a single bubble, this remnant cloud
will still exhibit the same qualitative dynamic behavior, including the possible
production of a shock wave following the point of minimum cavity volume. Two
important research eﬀorts in Japan then shifted the focus back to the remnant
cloud shock. First Shima et al. (1983) used high speed Schlieren photography
to show that a spherical shock wave was indeed generated by the remnant cloud

ﬂow pump.

at the instance of minimum volume. Figure 3.12 shows a series of photographs
of a collapsing bubble along with the corresponding pressure trace. The instant
of minimum volume is between frames 6 and 7, and the trace clearly shows
the peak pressure occuring at that instant. When combined with the Schlieren
photographs showing a spherical shock being generated at this instant, this
seemed to relegate the microjet to a subsidiary role.
About the same time,
Fujikawa and Akamatsu (1980) used a photoelastic material so that they could
simultaneously observe the stresses in the solid and measure the acoustic pulses.
Using the ﬁrst collapse of a bubble as the trigger, Fujikawa and Akamatsu
employed a variable time delay to take photographs of the stress state in the

solid at various instants relative to the second collapse. They simultaneously
recorded the pressure in the liquid and were able to conﬁrm that the impulsive
stresses in the material were initiated at the same moment as the acoustic pulse
(to within about 1 µs). They also conclude that this corresponded to the instant
of minimum volume and that the waves were not produced by the microjet.
However, in a later investigation, Kimoto (1987) was able to observe stress
pulses that resulted both from microjet impingement and from the remnant
cloud collapse shock. Typically, the impulsive pressures from the latter are 2 to
3 times larger than those due to the microjet, but it would seem that both may
contribute to the impulsive loading of the surface.
For detailed experimental evaluation of the comparative susceptibility of var-
ious materials to cavitation damage, the reader is referred to Knapp, Daily, and
Hammitt (1970). Standard devices have been been used to evaluate these com-
parative susceptibilities. The most common consists of a device that oscillates
a specimen in a liquid, producing periodic growth and collapse of cavitation
bubbles on the face of the specimen. The tests are conducted over many hours
with regular weighing to determine the weight loss. It transpires that the rate
of loss of material is not constant. Causes suggested for changes in the rate of
loss of material include time constants associated with the fatigue process and
the fact that an irregular, damaged surface may produce an altered pattern of
cavitation. Commonly, these test cells are operated by a magnetostrictive device
in order to achieve the standard frequencies of 5 kHz or, sometimes, 20 kHz.
These frequencies cause the largest cavitating bubble clouds on the surface of
the specimen because they are close to the natural frequencies of a signiﬁcant
fraction of the nuclei present in the liquid (see Section 4.2). In addition to the
magnetostrictive devices, standard material susceptibility tests are also carried
out using cavitating venturis and rotating disks.
In most practical devices, cavitation damage is a very undesirable. However,
there are some circumstances in which the phenomenon is used to advantage.
It is believed, for example, that the mechanics of rock-cutting by high speed
water jets is caused, at least in part, by cavitation in the jet as it ﬂows over a
rough rock surface. Many readers have also been subjected to the teeth-cleaning
power of the small, high-speed cavitating water jets used by dentists; those with
dentures may also have successfully employed acoustic cavitation to clean their
dentures in commercial acoustic cleaners. On the other side of the coin, the
violence of a collapsing bubble is suspected of causing major tissue damage in
head injuries.
3.7
DAMAGE DUE TO CLOUD COLLAPSE
In many practical devices cavitation damage is observed to occur in quite lo-
calized areas, for example, in a pump impeller. Often this is the result of the
periodic and coherent collapse of a cloud of cavitation bubbles.
Such is the
case in the magnetostrictive cavitation testing equipment mentioned above. A
typical cloud of bubbles generated by such acoustic means is shown in Figure

3.13. In other hydraulic machines, the periodicity may occur naturally as a
result of regular shedding of cavitating vortices, or it may be a response to a
periodic disturbance imposed on the ﬂow. Example of the kinds of imposed
ﬂuctuations are the interaction between a row of rotor vanes and a row of stator
vanes in a pump or turbine or the interaction between a ship’s propeller and
the nonuniform wake behind the ship. In almost all such cases the coherent
collapse of the cloud can cause much more intense noise and more potential for
damage than in a similar nonﬂuctuating ﬂow. Consequently the damage is most
severe on the solid surface close to the location of cloud collapse. An example of
this phenomenon is included in Figure 3.14 taken from Soyama, Kato, and Oba
(1992). In this instance clouds of cavitation are being shed from the leading
edge of a centrifugal pump blade and are collapsing in a speciﬁc location, as
suggested by the pattern of cavitation in the left-hand photograph. This leads
to the localized damage shown in the right-hand photograph.
At the time of writing, a number of research eﬀorts are focusing on the
dynamics of cavitation clouds. Later, in Section 6.10, we analyze some of the
basic dynamics of spherical bubble clouds and show that the interaction between
bubbles lead to a coherent dynamics of the cloud, including natural frequencies
that can be much smaller than the natural frequencies of individual bubbles.
These studies suggest that the coherent collapse can be more violent than that
of individual bubbles. However, a complete explanation for the increase in the
noise and damage potential does not yet exist.

acoustically. From Plesset and Ellis (1955).

3.8
CAVITATION NOISE
The violent and catastrophic collapse of cavitation bubbles results in the pro-
duction of noise as well as the possibility of material damage to nearby solid
surfaces. The noise is a consequence of the momentary large pressures that are
generated when the contents of the bubble are highly compressed. Consider the
ﬂow in the liquid caused by the volume displacement of a growing or collapsing
cavity. In the far ﬁeld the ﬂow will approach that of a simple source, and it is
clear that Equation (2.7) for the pressure will be dominated by the ﬁrst term
on the right-hand side (the unsteady inertial term) since it decays more slowly
with radius, r, than the second term. If we denote the time-varying volume
of the cavity by V (t) and substitute using Equation (2.2), it follows that the
time-varying component of the pressure in the far ﬁeld is given by
pa =
ρL
4πR
d2V
dt2
(3.10)
where pa is the radiated acoustic pressure and we denote the distance, r, from the
cavity center to the point of measurement by R (for a more thorough treatment

see Dowling and Ffowcs Williams 1983 and Blake 1986b). Since the noise is
directly proportional to the second derivative of the volume with respect to
time, it is clear that the noise pulse generated at bubble collapse occurs because
of the very large and positive values of d2V/dt2 when the bubble is close to its
minimum size. It is conventional (see, for example, Blake 1986b) to present the
sound level using a root mean square pressure or acoustic pressure, ps, deﬁned
by
p2
s = p2a =
 ∞
0
G(f)df
(3.11)
and to represent the distribution over the frequency range, f, by the spectral
density function, G(f).
The crackling noise that accompanies cavitation is one of the most evident
characteristics of this phenomenon to the researcher or engineer. The onset of
cavitation is often detected ﬁrst by this noise rather than by visual observation
of the bubbles.
Moreover, for the practical engineer it is often the primary
means of detecting cavitation in devices such as pumps and valves. Indeed,
several empirical methods have been suggested that estimate the rate of material
damage by measuring the noise generated (for example, Lush and Angell 1984).
The noise due to cavitation in the oriﬁce of a hydraulic control valve is
typical, and spectra from such an experiment are presented in Figure 3.15. The

lowest curve at σ = 0.523 represents the turbulent noise from the noncavitating
ﬂow. Below the incipient cavitation number (about 0.523 in this case) there
is a dramatic increase in the noise level at frequencies of about 5 kHz and
above. The spectral peak between 5 kHz and 10 kHz corresponds closely to
the expected natural frequencies of the nuclei present in the ﬂow (see Section
4.2).
Most of the analytical approaches to cavitation noise build on knowledge
of the dynamics of collapse of a single bubble. Fourier analyses of the radi-
ated acoustic pressure due to a single bubble were ﬁrst visualized by Rayleigh
(1917) and implemented by Mellen (1954) and Fitzpatrick and Strasberg (1956).
In considering such Fourier analyses, it is convenient to nondimensionalize the
frequency by the typical time span of the whole event or, equivalently, by the col-
lapse time, tT C, given by Equation (2.40). Now consider the frequency content
of G(f) using the dimensionless frequency, ftT C. Since the volume of the bub-
ble increases from zero to a ﬁnite value and then returns to zero, it follows that
for ftT C < 1 the Fourier transform of the volume is independent of frequency.
Consequently d2V/dt2 will be proportional to f2 and therefore G(f) ∝f4 (see
Fitzpatrick and Strasberg 1956). This is the origin of the left-hand asymptote
in Figure 3.16. The behavior at intermediate frequencies for which ftT C > 1
has been the subject of more speculation and debate. Mellen (1954) and others
considered the typical equations governing the collapse of a spherical bubble
in the absence of thermal eﬀects and noncondensable gas (Equation (2.36))
and concluded that, since the velocity ˙R ∝R−3
2 , it follows that R ∝t
2
5 .
Therefore the Fourier transform of d2V/dt2 leads to the asymptotic behavior
G(f) ∝f−2
5 . The error in this analysis is the neglect of the noncondensable
gas. When this is included and when the collapse is suﬃciently advanced, the
last term in the square brackets of Equation (2.36) becomes comparable with
the previous terms. Then the behavior is quite diﬀerent from R ∝t
2
5 . Moreover,
the values of d2V/dt2 are much larger during this rebound phase, and therefore
the frequency content of the rebound phase will dominate the spectrum. It is
therefore not surprising that the f−2
5 is not observed in practice. Rather, most
of the experimental results seem to exhibit an intermediate frequency behavior
like f−1 or f−2. Jorgensen (1961) measured the noise from submerged, cavi-
tating jets and found a behavior like f−2 at the higher frequencies (see Figure
3.16). However, most of the experimental data for cavitating bodies or hydro-
foils exhibit a weaker decay. The data by Arakeri and Shangumanathan (1985)
from cavitating headform experiments show a very consistent f−1 trend over
almost the entire frequency range, and very similar results have been obtained
by Ceccio and Brennen (1991) (see Figure 3.20). Though the data of Blake et al.
(1977) for a cavitating hydrofoil exhibit some consistent peaks, the overall trend
in their data is also consistent with f−1. This is also the asymptotic behavior
exhibited at higher frequencies by the data of Barker (1973) for a cavitating foil.
Several authors have also analyzed the eﬀects of the compressibility of the
liquid. Mellen (1954) and Fitzpatrick and Strasberg (1956) conclude that this
causes faster decay like f−2 above some critical frequency, though this has not

been clearly demonstrated experimentally.
In Figure 3.16 typical functional
behaviors of G(f) have been included in a graph showing measurements of some
of the noise from a cavitating jet taken by Jorgensen (1961).
The peaks in many of the spectra of the noise from cavitating ﬂows (for
example those of Figures 3.15 and 3.16) tend to lower frequencies as the cavi-
tation number decreases, primarily because of an increase in the amplitude of
the higher frequencies. This trend is further illustrated by the data for cavi-
tating jets presented in Figure 3.17. Given some form for the asymptotes at
high and low frequency and some functional behavior for the location of the
peak frequency, it is not unreasonable to seek to reduce the measured spec-
tra for a given type of cavitating ﬂow to some universal form.
Arakeri and
Shangumanathan (1985) were able to reduce the noise spectra from cavitating
headform experiments to a single band provided the bubble population was low
enough to eliminate bubble/bubble interaction. Blake (1986a) has attempted a
similar task for the various kinds of cavitation that can occur on a propeller,
since the ability to scale from model tests to the prototype is important in that
context. There remain, however, a number of unresolved issues that seem to
demand a closer examination of the basic mechanics of noise production even
in the absence of bubble/bubble interactions.
Recently Ceccio and Brennen (1991) have recorded the noise from individual
cavitation bubbles in a ﬂow; a typical acoustic signal from their experiments is
reproduced in Figure 3.18. The large positive pulse at about 450 µs corresponds
to the ﬁrst collapse of the bubble. This ﬁrst pulse in Figure 3.18 is followed by
some facility-dependent oscillations and by a second pulse at about 1100 µs.
This corresponds to the second collapse, which follows the rebound from the
ﬁrst collapse. Further rebounds are possible but were not observed in these
experiments.
A good measure of the magnitude of the collapse pulse is the acoustic im-
pulse, I, deﬁned as the area under the pulse or
I =

padt
(3.12)
where t1 and t2 are times before and after the pulse at which pa is zero. For
later purposes we also deﬁne a dimensionless impulse, I∗, as
I∗= 4πIR/ρLU∞R2
H
(3.13)
where U∞and RH are the reference velocity and length in the ﬂow. The average
acoustic impulses for individual bubble collapses on two axisymmetric headforms
(ITTC and Schiebe headforms) are compared in Figure 3.19 with impulses pre-
dicted from integration of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Since these theoretical
calculations assume that the bubble remains spherical, the discrepancy between
the theory and the experiments is not too surprising. Indeed one interpretation
of Figure 3.19 is that the theory can provide an order of magnitude estimate
and an upper bound on the noise produced by a single bubble. In actuality,

the departure from sphericity produces a less focused collapse and therefore less
noise.
Typical spectra showing the frequency content in single bubble noise are
included in Figure 3.20. If the events are randomly distributed in time (see
below), this would also correspond to the overall cavitation noise spectrum.
These spectra exhibit the previously mentioned f−1 behavior for the range
1 →50 kHz; the rapid decline at about 80 kHz represents the limit of the
hydrophone used to make these measurements.
The next step is to consider the synthesis of cavitation noise from the noise
produced by individual cavitation bubbles or events.
This is a fairly simple
matter provided the events can be considered to occur randomly in time. At
low nuclei population densities the evidence suggests that this is indeed the case
(see, for example, Morozov 1969). Baiter, Gruneis, and Tilmann (1982) have
explored the consequences of the departures from randomness that could occur
at larger bubble population densities. Here, we limit the analysis to the case of
random events. Then, if the impulse produced by each event is denoted by I

Consider the scaling of cavitation noise that is implicit in this construct. We
shall omit some factors of proportionality for the sake of clarity, so the results
are only intended as a qualitative guide.
Both the experimental results and the analysis based on the Rayleigh-Plesset

equation indicate that the nondimensional impulse produced by a single cavita-
tion event is strongly correlated with the maximum volume of the bubble prior
to collapse and is almost independent of the other ﬂow parameters. It follows
from Equations (3.10) and (3.12) that

and the values of dV/dt at the moments t = t1, t2 when d2V/dt2 = 0 may be
obtained from the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. If the bubble radius at the time
t1 is denoted by RX and the coeﬃcient of pressure in the liquid at that moment
is denoted by Cpx, then

(3.17)
The aforementioned integrations of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation yield a factor
of proportionality, β, of about 35. Moreover, the upper envelope of the experi-
mental data of which Figure 3.19 is a sample appears to correspond to a value
of β ≈4. We note that a quite similar relation between I∗and RM/RH emerges
from the analysis by Esipov and Naugol’nykh (1973) of the compressive sound
wave generated by the collapse of a gas bubble in a compressible liquid. Indeed,
the compressibility of the liquid does not appear to aﬀect the acoustic impulse
signiﬁcantly.
From the above relations, it follows that
I ≈β

Consequently, the evaluation of the impulse from a single event is completed by
some estimate of RM. Previously (Section 2.5) we evaluated RM and showed it
to be independent of U∞for a given cavitation number. In that case I is linear
with U∞.
The event rate,
˙
NE, can be considerably more complicated to evaluate than
might at ﬁrst be thought. If all the nuclei ﬂowing through a certain, known
streamtube (say with a cross-sectional area in the upstream ﬂow of AN) were
to cavitate similarly, then the result would be
˙
NE = NANU∞
(3.19)

where N is the nuclei concentration (number/unit volume) in the incoming
ﬂow. Then it follows that the acoustic pressure level resulting from substituting
Equations (3.19), (3.18) and (2.52) into Equation (3.14) becomes
pS ≈β
3 ρLU 2

(3.20)
where we have omitted some of the constants of order unity. For the relatively
simple ﬂows considered here, Equation (3.20) yields a sound pressure level that
scales with U 2
∞and with R4
H because AN ∝R2
H. This scaling with velocity
does correspond roughly to that which has been observed in some experiments
on traveling bubble cavitation, for example, those of Blake, Wolpert, and Geib
(1977) and Arakeri and Shangumanathan (1985).
The former observe that
pS ∝U m
∞where m = 1.5 to 2. There are, however, a number of complicating
factors that can alter these scaling relationships. First, as we have discussed
earlier in Section 2.5, only those nuclei larger than a certain critical size, RC, will
actually grow to become cavitation bubbles. Since RC is a function of both σ and
the velocity, U∞, this means that the eﬀective N will be a function of RC and
U∞. Since RC decreases as U∞increases, this would tend to produce powers,
m, somewhat greater than 2. But it is also the case that, in any experimental
facility, N will typically change with U∞in some facility-dependent manner.
Often this will cause N to decrease with U∞at constant σ (since N will typically
decrease with increasing tunnel pressure), and this eﬀect would then produce
values of m that are less than 2.
Diﬀerent scaling laws will apply when the cavitation is generated by tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations such as in a turbulent jet (see, for example, Ooi 1985 and
Franklin and McMillan 1984). Then the typical tension experienced by a nu-
cleus as it moves along a disturbed path in a turbulent ﬂow is very much more
diﬃcult to estimate. Consequently, the models for the sound pressure due to
cavitation and the scaling of that sound with velocity are less well understood.
When the population of bubbles becomes suﬃciently large, the radiated
noise will begin to be aﬀected by the interactions between the bubbles.
In
Chapters 6 and 7 we discuss some analyses and some of the consequences of
these interactions in clouds of cavitating bubbles.
There are also a number
of experimental studies of the noise from the collapse of cavitating clouds, for
example, that of Bark and van Berlekom (1978).
3.9
CAVITATION LUMINESCENCE
Though highly localized both temporally and spatially, the extremely high tem-
peratures and pressures that can occur in the noncondensable gas during col-
lapse are believed to be responsible for the phenomenon known as luminescence,
the emission of light that is observed during cavitation bubble collapse. The
phenomenon was ﬁrst observed by Marinesco and Trillat (1933), and a num-
ber of diﬀerent explanations were advanced to explain the emissions. The fact
that the light was being emitted at collapse was ﬁrst demonstrated by Meyer

and Kuttruﬀ(1959). They observed cavitation on the face of a rod oscillat-
ing magnetostrictively and correlated the light with the collapse point in the
growth-and-collapse cycle. The balance of evidence now seems to conﬁrm the
suggestion by Noltingk and Neppiras (1950) that the phenomenon is caused by
the compression and adiabatic heating of the noncondensable gas in the collaps-
ing bubble. As we discussed previously in Sections 2.4 and 3.4, temperatures
of the order of 6000◦K can be anticipated on the basis of uniform compression
of the noncondensable gas; the same calculations suggest that these high tem-
peratures will last for only a fraction of a microsecond. Such conditions would
indeed explain the emission of light. Indeed, the measurements of the spectrum
of sonoluminescence by Taylor and Jarman (1970), Flint and Suslick (1991),
and others suggest a temperature of about 5000K. However, some recent ex-
periments by Barber and Putterman (1991) indicate much higher temperatures
and even shorter emission durations of the order of picoseconds. Speculations
on the explanation for these observations have centered on the suggestion by
Jarman (1960) that the collapsing bubble forms a spherical, inward-propagating
shock in the gas contents of the bubble and that the focusing of the shock at
the center of the bubble is an important reason for the extremely high apparent
“temperatures” associated with the sonoluminescence radiation. It is, however,
important to observe that spherical symmetry is essential for this mechanism
to have any signiﬁcant consequences. One would therefore expect that the dis-
tortions caused by a ﬂow would not allow signiﬁcant shock focusing and would
even reduce the eﬀectiveness of the basic compression mechanism.
When it occurs in the context of acoustic cavitation (see Chapter 4), lumi-
nescence is called sonoluminescence despite the evidence that it is the cavitation
rather than the sound that causes the light emission. Sonoluminescence and the
associated chemistry that is induced by the high temperatures and pressures
(known as “sonochemistry”) have been more thoroughly investigated than the
corresponding processes in hydrodynamic cavitation. However, the subject is
beyond the scope of this book and the reader is referred to other works such
as the book by Young (1989). As one would expect from the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation, the surface tension and vapor pressure of the liquid are important
in determining the sonoluminescence ﬂux as the data of Jarman (1959) clearly
show (see Figure 3.21). Certain aqueous solutes like sodium disulphide seem to
enhance the luminescence, though it is not clear that the same mechanism is
responsible for the light emission under these circumstances. Sonoluminescence
is also strongly dependent on the thermal conductivity of the gas (Hickling 1963,
Young 1976), and this is particularly evident with gases like xenon and krypton,
which have low thermal conductivities. Clearly then, the conduction of heat in
the gas plays an important role in the phenomenon. Therefore, the breakup
of the bubble prior to complete collapse might be expected to eliminate the
phenomenon completely.
Light emission in a cavitating ﬂow was ﬁrst investigated by Jarman and Tay-
lor (1964, 1965) who observed luminescence in a cavitating venturi and identiﬁed
the source as the region of bubble collapse. They also found that an acoustic
pressure pulse was associated with each ﬂash of light. The maximum emission

was in a band of wavelengths around 5000 angstroms, which is in accord with
the many apocryphal accounts of steady or ﬂashing blue light emanating from
ﬂowing water. Peterson and Anderson (1967) also conducted experiments with
venturis and explored the eﬀects of diﬀerent, noncondensable gases dissolved in
the water. They observe that the emission of light implies blackbody sources
with a temperature above 6000◦K. There are, however, other experimenters
who found it very diﬃcult to observe any luminescence in a cavitating ﬂow.
One suspects that only bubbles that collapse with signiﬁcant spherical symme-
try will actually produce luminescence. Such events may be exceedingly rare in
many ﬂows.
The phenomenon of luminescence is not just of academic interest.
For
one thing there is evidence that it may initiate explosions in liquid explosives
(Gordeev et al. 1967). More constructively, there seems to be signiﬁcant inter-
est in utilizing the chemical-processing potential of the high temperatures and
pressures in what is otherwise a benign environment. For example, it is possible
to use cavitation to break up harmful molecules in water (Dahi 1982).

Chapter 4
DYNAMICS OF
OSCILLATING BUBBLES
4.1
INTRODUCTION
The focus of the two preceding chapters was on the dynamics of the growth
and collapse of a single bubble experiencing one period of tension.
In this
chapter we review the response of a bubble to a continuous, oscillating pressure
ﬁeld. Much of the material comes within the scope of acoustic cavitation, a
subject with an extensive literature that is reviewed in more detail elsewhere
(Flynn 1964; Neppiras 1980; Plesset and Prosperetti 1977; Prosperetti 1982,
1984; Crum 1979; Young 1989). We include here a brief summary of the basic
phenomena.
One useful classiﬁcation of the subject uses the magnitude of the bubble
radius oscillations in response to the imposed ﬂuctuating pressure ﬁeld. Three
regimes can be identiﬁed:
1. For very small pressure amplitudes the response is linear. Section 4.2 con-
tains the ﬁrst step in any linear analysis, the identiﬁcation of the natural
frequency of an oscillating bubble.
2. Due to the nonlinearities in the governing equations, particularly the
Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.12), the response of a bubble will begin to
be aﬀected by these nonlinearities as the amplitude of oscillation is in-
creased. Nevertheless the bubble may continue to oscillate stably. Such
circumstances are referred to as “stable acoustic cavitation” to distinguish
them from those of the third regime described below. Several diﬀerent
nonlinear phenomena can aﬀect stable acoustic cavitation in important
ways. Among these are the production of subharmonics, the phenomenon
of rectiﬁed diﬀusion, and the generation of Bjerknes forces. Each of these
is described in greater detail later in the chapter.
113

3. Under other circumstances the change in bubble size during a single cycle
of oscillation can become so large that the bubble undergoes a cycle of
explosive cavitation growth and violent collapse similar to that described
in the preceding chapter. Such a response is termed “transient acoustic
cavitation” and is distinguished from stable acoustic cavitation by the fact
that the bubble radius changes by several orders of magnitude during each
cycle.
Though we imply that these three situations follow with increasing ampli-
tude, it is important to note that other factors are important in determining the
kind of response that will occur for a given oscillating pressure ﬁeld. One of the
factors is the relationship between the frequency, ω, of the imposed oscillations
and the natural frequency, ωN, of the bubble. Sometimes this is characterized
by the relationship between the equilibrium radius of the bubble, RE, in the
absence of pressure oscillations and the size of the hypothetical bubble, RR,
which would resonate at the imposed frequency, ω. Another important factor
in determining whether the response is stable or transient is the relationship
between the pressure oscillation amplitude, ˜p, and the mean pressure, ¯p∞. For
example, if ˜p < ¯p∞, the bubble is never placed under tension and will therefore
never cavitate.
A related factor that will aﬀect the response is whether the
bubble is predominantly vapor-ﬁlled or gas-ﬁlled. Stable oscillations are more
likely with predominantly gas-ﬁlled bubbles while bubbles which contain mostly
vapor will more readily exhibit transient acoustic cavitation.
We begin, however, with a discussion of the small-amplitude, linear response
of a bubble to oscillations in the ambient pressure.
4.2
BUBBLE NATURAL FREQUENCIES
The response of a bubble to oscillations in the pressure at inﬁnity will now
be considered.
Initially we shall neglect thermal eﬀects and the inﬂuence of
liquid compressibility. As discussed in the next section both of these lead to an
increase in the damping above that represented by the viscous terms, which are
retained. However, both can be approximately represented by increases in the
damping or the “eﬀective” viscosity.
Consider the linearized dynamic solution of Equation (2.27) when the pres-
sure at inﬁnity consists of a mean value, ¯p∞, upon which is superimposed a
small oscillatory pressure of amplitude, ˜p, and radian frequency, ω, so that
p∞= ¯p∞+ Re{˜pejωt}
(4.1)
The linear dynamic response of the bubble will then be
R = RE[1 + Re{ϕejωt}]
(4.2)
where RE is the equilibrium size at the pressure, ¯p∞, and the bubble radius
response, ϕ, will in general be a complex number such that RE|ϕ| is the am-
plitude of the bubble radius oscillations. The phase of ϕ represents the phase
diﬀerence between p∞and R.

For the present we shall assume that the mass of gas in the bubble, mG,
remains constant. Then substituting Equations (4.1) and (4.2) into Equation
(2.27), neglecting all terms of order |ϕ|2 and using the equilibrium condition
(2.41) one ﬁnds

The connection with the stability criterion of Section 2.5 is clear when one
observes that no natural frequency exists for tensions (pV −¯p∞) > 4S/3RE
(for isothermal gas behavior, k = 1); stable oscillations can only occur about a
stable equilibrium.
The peak frequency, ωP , is an important quantity to consider in any bubble
dynamic problem.
Note from Equation (4.41) that ωP is a function only of
(¯p∞−pV ), RE, and the liquid properties. Typical graphs for ωP as a function
of RE for several (¯p∞−pV ) values are shown in Figures (4.1) and (4.2) for water
at 300◦K (S = 0.0717, µL = 0.000863, ρL = 996.3) and for sodium at 800◦K (S
= 0.15, µL = 0.000229, ρL = 825.8). As is evident from Equation (4.41), the

of (¯p∞−pV ) as indicated.
second and third terms on the right-hand side dominate at very small RE and
the frequency is almost independent of (¯p∞−pV ). Indeed, no peak frequency
exists below a size equal to about 2ν2
LρL/S. For larger bubbles the viscous term
becomes negligible and ωP depends on (¯p∞−pV ). If the latter is positive, the
natural frequency approaches zero like R−1
E . In the case of tension, pV > ¯p∞,
the peak frequency does not exist above RE = RC.
It is important to take note of the fact that for the typical nuclei commonly
found in water, which lie in range 1 to 100 µm, the natural frequencies are
of the order, 5 to 25 kHz. This has several important practical consequences.
First, if one wishes to cause cavitation in water by means of an acoustic pressure
ﬁeld, then the frequencies that will be most eﬀective in producing a substantial
concentration of large cavitation bubbles will be in this frequency range. This is
also the frequency range employed in magnetostrictive devices used to oscillate
solid material samples in water (or other liquid) in order to test the susceptibil-
ity of that material to cavitation damage (Knapp et al. 1970). Of course, the
oscillation of the nuclei produced in this way will be highly nonlinear; never-
theless, the peak response frequency will be less than but not radically diﬀerent
from the peak response frequency for small linear oscillations.
It is also important to note that, like any oscillator, a nucleus excited at its
resonant frequency, ωP, will exhibit a response whose amplitude is primarily a

function of the damping. Since the viscous damping is rather small in many
practical circumstances, the amplitude given by Equation (4.7) can be very large
due to the factor µL in the denominator. It could be heuristically argued that
this might cause the nucleus to exceed its critical size, RC (see Section 2.5), and
that highly nonlinear behavior with very large amplitudes would result. The
pressure amplitude, ˜pC, required to achieve RE|ϕ| = RC −RE can be readily
evaluated from Equation (4.7) and the results of the last section:

(4.9)
and in many circumstances this is approximately equal to 4µLωN. For a 10 µm
nuclei in water at 300◦K for which the natural frequency is about 10 kHz this
critical pressure amplitude is only 0.002 bar.
Consequently, a nucleus could
readily be oscillated in a way that would cause it to exceed the Blake critical
radius and therefore proceed to explosive cavitation growth. Of course, nonlin-
ear eﬀects may substantially alter the estimate given in Equation (4.9). Further
comment on this and other critical or threshold oscillating pressure levels is
delayed until Sections 4.8 and 4.9.

4.3
EFFECTIVE POLYTROPIC CONSTANT
At this juncture it is appropriate to discuss the validity of the assumption that
the gas in the bubble behaves polytropically according to Equation (2.26). For
the circumstances of bubble growth and collapse considered in Chapter 2 the
polytropic assumption is usually considered acceptable for the following reasons.
First, during the growth of a vapor bubble the gas plays a relatively minor role,
and the preponderance of vapor will tend to determine the bubble temperature.
Second, during the later stages of collapse when the gas predominates, the
velocities are so high that an adiabatic assumption, k = γ, seems appropriate.
Since a collapsing bubble loses its spherical symmetry, the resulting internal
motions of the gas would, in any case, generate mixing, which would tend to
negate any more sophisicated model based on spherical symmetry.
The issue of the appropriate polytropic constant is directly coupled with
the evaluation of the eﬀective thermal damping of the bubble and was ﬁrst
addressed by Pfriem (1940), Devin (1959), and Chapman and Plesset (1971).
Prosperettti (1977b) analysed the problem in detail with particular attention
to thermal diﬀusion in the gas and predicted the eﬀective polytropic exponents
shown in Figure 4.3. In that ﬁgure the eﬀective polytropic exponent is plotted

the behavior tends to become isothermal with k = 1.
On the other hand,
at higher frequencies (at which there is insuﬃcient time for heat transfer) the
behavior initially tends to become isentropic (k = γ). At still higher frequencies
the mean free path in the gas becomes comparable with the bubble size, and
the exponent can take on values outside the range 1 < k < γ (see Plesset
and Prosperetti 1977). Crum (1983) has made measurements of the eﬀective
polytropic exponent for bubbles of various gases in water.
Figure 4.4 shows
typical experimental data for air bubbles in water. The results are consistent
with the theory for frequencies below the resonant frequency.

standing of the theory in which

E. As we shall discuss in the next section, this analysis also
predicts an eﬀective thermal damping that is related to Im{Υ}.
While the use of an eﬀective polytropic exponent (and the associated thermal
damping given by Equation (4.15)) provides a consistent approach for linear
oscillations, Prosperetti, Crum, and Commander (1988) have shown that it may
cause signiﬁcant errors when the oscillations become nonlinear. Under these

circumstances the behavior of the gas may depart from that which is consistent
with an eﬀective polytropic exponent, and there seems to be no option but to
numerically solve the detailed mass, momentum, and energy equations in the
interior of the bubble.
4.4
ADDITIONAL DAMPING TERMS
Chapman and Plesset (1971) have presented a useful summary of the three pri-
mary contributions to the damping of bubble oscillations, namely that due to
liquid viscosity, that due to liquid compressibility through acoustic radiation,
and that due to thermal conductivity. It is particularly convenient to represent
the three components of damping as three additive contributions to an eﬀec-
tive liquid viscosity, µE, which can then be employed in the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation in place of the actual liquid viscosity, µL :
µE = µL + µT + µA
(4.13)
where the “acoustic” viscosity, µA, is given by
µA = ρLω2R2
E
4cL
(4.14)
where cL is the velocity of sound in the liquid. The “thermal” viscosity, µT ,
follows from the same analysis as was used to obtain the eﬀective polytropic

where Υ is given by Equation (4.12).
The relative magnitudes of the three components of damping (or “eﬀective”
viscosity) can be quite diﬀerent for diﬀerent bubble sizes or radii, RE. This is
illustrated by the data for air bubbles in water at 20◦C and atmospheric pressure
that is taken from Chapman and Plesset (1971) and reproduced as Figure 4.5.
Note that the viscous component dominates for very small bubbles, the thermal
component is dominant for most bubbles of practical interest, and the acoustic
component only dominates for bubbles larger than about 1 cm.

NONLINEAR EFFECTS
The preceding sections assume that the perturbation in the bubble radius, ϕ,
is suﬃciently small so that the linear approximation holds. However, as Plesset
and Prosperetti (1977) have detailed in their review of the subject, single bubbles
exhibit a number of interesting and important nonlinear phenomena. When a
liquid that will inevitably contain microbubbles is irradiated with sound of a
given frequency, ω, the nonlinear response results in harmonic dispersion, which
not only produces harmonics with frequencies that are integer multiples of ω
(superharmonics) but, more unusually, subharmonics with frequencies less than
ω of the form mω/n where m and n are integers. Both the superharmonics
and subharmonics become more prominent as the amplitude of excitation is
increased. The production of subharmonics was ﬁrst observed experimentally
by Esche (1952), and possible origins of this nonlinear eﬀect were explored in
detail by Noltingk and Neppiras (1950, 1951), Flynn (1964), Borotnikova and
Soloukin (1964), and Neppiras (1969), among others.
Neppiras (1969) also
surmised that subharmonic resonance could evolve into transient cavitation.
These analytical and numerical investigations use numerical solutions of the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation to explore the nonlinear characteristics of a single
bubble excited by an oscillating pressure with a single frequency, ω. As might
be expected, diﬀerent kinds of response occur depending on whether ω is greater
or less than the natural frequency of the bubble, ωN. Figure 4.6 presents two

radius 1 µm in water at a mean ambient pressure of 1 bar plotted as a function of

examples of the kinds of response encountered, one for ω < ωN and the other
for ω > ωN. Note the presence of subharmonics in both cases.
Lauterborn (1976) examined numerical solutions for a large number of diﬀer-
ent excitation frequencies and was able to construct frequency response curves
of the kind shown in Figure 4.7. Notice the progressive development of the
peak responses at subharmonic frequencies as the amplitude of the excitation is
increased. Nonlinear eﬀects not only create these subharmonic peaks but also
cause the resonant peaks (both the main resonance near ω/ωN = 1 and the
subharmonic resonances) to be skewed to the left, creating the discontinuities
indicated by the dashed vertical lines. These correspond to bifurcations or sud-
den transitions between two valid solutions, one with a much larger amplitude
than the other. Prosperetti (1977a) has provided a theoretical analysis of these
transitions.
4.6
WEAKLY NONLINEAR ANALYSIS
When the amplitudes of oscillation are large, there are no simple analytical
methods available, and one must resort to numerical calculations such as those
of Lauterborn (1976) in order to investigate the phenomena that result from
nonlinearity. However, while the amplitudes are still fairly small, it is valid to
use an expansion technique to investigate weakly nonlinear eﬀects.
Here we
shall retain only terms that are quadratic in the oscillation amplitude; cubic
and higher order terms are neglected.
To illustrate weakly nonlinear analysis and the frequency dispersion that
results from this procedure, Equations (4.1) and (4.2) are rewritten as

When these are substituted into Equation (2.27), all cubic or higher order terms
are neglected, and the coeﬃcients of the time-dependent terms are gathered

We shall ﬁrst examine the characteristics of the radial oscillations that are
caused by a single excitation frequency. It is clear from the form of Equation
(4.18) that, in this case, the only non-zero ϕn occur at frequencies that are
integer multiples of the excitation frequency.
Consequently, for this class of

problems we may chose δ to be the excitation frequency; then ˜p1 is the amplitude
of that excitation and ˜pn = 0 for n ̸= 1. Figure 4.8 provides two comparisons
between the weakly nonlinear solutions and more exact numerical integrations
of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Clearly these will diverge as the amplitude of
oscillation is increased; nevertheless the examples in Figure 4.8 show that the
weakly nonlinear solutions are qualitatively valuable.
Figure 4.9 presents examples of the values for |ϕn| for three diﬀerent ampli-
tudes of excitation and demonstrates how the harmonics become more important
as the amplitude increases. In this example, the frequency of excitation is ωN/6;
the prominence of harmonics close to the natural frequency is characteristic of
all solutions in which the excitation frequency is less than ωN.
Weakly nonlinear solutions can also be used to construct frequency response
spectra similar to those due to Lauterborn (1976) described in the preceding
section. Figure 4.10 includes examples of such frequency response spectra ob-
tained by plotting the maximum possible deviation from the equilibrium radius,
(Rmax−RE)/RE, against the excitation frequency. For convenience we estimate

Clearly the weakly nonlinear solutions exhibit subharmonic resonances similar to
those seen in the more exact solutions like those of Lauterborn (1976). However,
they lack some of the ﬁner detail such as the skewing of the resonant peaks that

produces the sudden jumps in the response at some subresonant frequencies.
The advantages of the weakly nonlinear analyses become more apparent
when dealing with problems of more complex geometry or multiple frequencies of
excitation. It is particularly useful in studying the interactions between bubbles
in bubble clouds, a subject that is discussed in Chapter 6.
4.7
CHAOTIC OSCILLATIONS
In recent years, the modern methods of nonlinear dynamical systems analysis
have led to substantial improvement in the understanding of the nonlinear be-
havior of bubbles and of clouds of bubbles. Lauterborn and Suchla (1984) seem
to have been the ﬁrst to explore the bifurcation structure of single bubble oscil-
lations. They constructed the bifurcation diagrams and strange attractor maps
that result from a compressible Rayleigh-Plesset equation similar to Equation
(3.1). Among the phenomena obtained was a period doubling sequence of a pe-
riodic orbit converging to a strange attractor. Subsequent studies by Smereka,
Birnir, and Banerjee (1987), Parlitz et al. (1990), and others have provided
further information on the nature of these chaotic, nonlinear oscillations of a
single, spherical bubble.
It remains to be seen how far real bubble systems
that involve departures from spherical symmetry and from the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation adhere to these complex dynamical behaviors.
In Section 6.10, we shall explore the linear, dynamic behavior of a cloud of

bubbles and will ﬁnd that such clouds exhibit their own characteristic dynamics
and natural frequencies. The nonlinear, chaotic behavior of clouds of bubbles
have also been recently examined by Smereka and Banerjee (1988) and Birnir
and Smereka (1990), and these studies reveal a parallel system of bifurcations
and strange attractors in the oscillations of bubble clouds.
4.8
THRESHOLD FOR TRANSIENT
CAVITATION
We now turn to one of the topics raised in the introduction to this chapter:
the distinction between those circumstances in which one would expect stable
acoustic cavitation and those in which transient acoustic cavitation would occur.
This issue was ﬁrst addressed by Noltingk and Neppiras (1950, 1951) and is
reviewed by Flynn (1964) and Young (1989), to which the reader is referred for
more detail.
We consider a bubble of equilibrium size, RE, containing a mass of gas, mG,
and subjected to a mean ambient pressure, ¯p∞, with a superimposed oscillation
of frequency, ω, and amplitude, ˜p (see Equations (4.1) and (4.2)). The ﬁrst
step in establishing the criterion is accomplished by the static stability analysis
of Section 2.5. There we explored the stability of a bubble when the pressure
far from the bubble was varied and identiﬁed a critical size, RC, and a critical
threshold pressure, p∞c, which, if reached, would lead to unstable bubble growth
and therefore, in the present context, to transient cavitation. The added com-
plication here is that there is only a ﬁnite time during each cycle during which
growth can occur, so one must address the issue of whether or not that time is
suﬃcient for signiﬁcant unstable growth.
The issue is determined by the relationship between the radian frequency,
ω, of the imposed oscillations and the natural frequency, ωN, of the bubble. If
ω ≪ωN, then the liquid inertia is relatively unimportant in the bubble dynamics
and the bubble will respond quasistatically.
Under these circumstances the
Blake criterion (see Section 2.5) will hold. Denoting the critical amplitude at
which transient cavitation will occur by ˜pC, it follows that the critical conditions
will be reached when the minimum instantaneous pressure, (¯p∞−˜p), just reaches
the critical Blake threshold pressure given by Equation (2.45). Therefore
˜pC = ¯p∞−pV + 4S

(4.23)
On the other hand, if ω ≫ωN, the issue will involve the dynamics of bubble
growth since inertia will determine the size of the bubble perturbations. The
details of this bubble dynamic problem have been addressed by Flynn (1964)
and convenient guidelines are provided by Apfel (1981). Following Apfel’s con-
struction, we note that a neccessary but not suﬃcient condition for transient
cavitation is that the ambient pressure, p∞, fall below the vapor pressure for part
of the oscillation cycle. The typical negative pressure will, of course, be given by

(¯p∞−˜p). Moreover, the pressure will be negative for some fraction of the period
of oscillation; that fraction is solely related to the parameter, β = (1 −¯p∞/˜p)
(Apfel 1981). Then, assuming that the quasistatic Blake threshold has been ex-
ceeded, the bubble growth rate will be given roughly by the asymptotic growth
rate of Equation (2.33). Combining this with the time available for growth, the
typical maximum bubble radius, RM, will be given by
RM = f(β)π

where we have neglected the vapor pressure, pV . In this expression the function

4.9
RECTIFIED MASS DIFFUSION
We now shift attention to a diﬀerent nonlinear eﬀect involving the mass transfer
of dissolved gas between the liquid and the bubble. This important nonlinear
diﬀusion eﬀect occurs in the presence of an acoustic ﬁeld and is known as “recti-
ﬁed mass diﬀusion” (Blake 1949a). Analytical models of this phenomenon were
ﬁrst put forward by Hsieh and Plesset (1961) and Eller and Flynn (1965), and
reviews of the subject can be found in Crum (1980, 1984) and Young (1989).
Consider a gas bubble in a liquid with dissolved gas as described in Section
2.6. Now, however, we add an oscillation to the ambient pressure. Gas will tend
to come out of solution into the bubble during that part of the oscillation cycle
when the bubble is larger than the mean because the partial pressure of gas in
the bubble is then depressed. Conversely, gas will redissolve during the other half
of the cycle when the bubble is smaller than the mean. The linear contributions
to the mass of gas in the bubble will, of course, balance so that the average gas
content in the bubble will not be aﬀected at this level. However, there are two
nonlinear eﬀects that tend to increase the mass of gas in the bubble. The ﬁrst of
these is due to the fact that release of gas by the liquid occurs during that part
of the cycle when the surface area is larger, and therefore the inﬂux during that
part of the cycle is slightly larger than the eﬄux during the part of the cycle
when the bubble is smaller. Consequently, there is a net ﬂux of gas into the

bubble which is quadratic in the perturbation amplitude. Second, the diﬀusion
boundary layer in the liquid tends to be stretched thinner when the bubble is
larger, and this also enhances the ﬂux into the bubble during the part of the
cycle when the bubble is larger.
This eﬀect contributes a second, quadratic
term to the net ﬂux of gas into the bubble. Recent analyses, which include all
of the contributing nonlinear terms (see Crum 1984 or Young 1989), yield the
following modiﬁcation to the steady mass diﬀusion result given previously in

where one must choose an appropriate µ to represent the total eﬀective damping
(see Section 4.4) and an appropriate eﬀective polytropic constant, k (see Section
4.3).
Valuable contributions to the evolution of these results were made by
Hsieh and Plesset (1961), Eller and Flynn (1965), Safar (1968), Eller (1969,
1972, 1975), Skinner (1970), and Crum (1980, 1984), among others.
Strasberg (1961) ﬁrst explored the issue of the conditions under which a
bubble would grow due to rectiﬁed diﬀusion. Clearly, the sign of the bubble
growth rate predicted by Equation (4.27) will be determined by the sign of the
term
c∞−cS(1 + 2S/RE ¯p∞)

Γ2

(4.34)
In the absence of oscillations and surface tension, this leads to the conclusion
that the bubble will grow when c∞> cS and will dissolve when the reverse is
true. The term involving surface tension causes bubbles in a saturated solution

theoretical predictions.
(cS = c∞) to dissolve but usually has only a minor eﬀect in real applications.
However, in the presence of oscillations the term Γ3/Γ2 will decrease below unity
as the amplitude, ˜p, is increased. This causes a positive increment in the growth
rate as anticipated earlier. Even in a subsaturated liquid for which c∞< cS this
increment could cause the sign of dR/dt to change and become positive. Thus
Equation (4.27) allows us to quantify the bubble growth rate due to rectiﬁed
mass diﬀusion.
If an oscillating pressure is applied to a ﬂuid consisting of a subsaturated or
saturated liquid and seeded with microbubbles of radius, RE, then Expression
(4.34) also demonstates that there will exist a certain critical or threshold am-
plitude above which the microbubbles will begin to grow by rectiﬁed diﬀusion.
This threshold amplitude, ˜pC, will be large enough so that the value of Γ3/Γ2
is suﬃciently small to make Expression (4.34) vanish. From Equations (4.29)

Typical experimental measurements of the rates of growth and of the thresh-

the work of Crum (1980, 1984) and are for distilled water that is saturated with

Equation (4.35).
air. It is clear that there is satisfactory agreement for the cases shown. How-
ever, Crum also observed signiﬁcant discrepancies when a surface-active agent
was added to the water to change the surface tension.
Finally, we note again that most of the theories assume spherical symmetry
and that departure from sphericity could alter the diﬀusion boundary layer in
ways that could radically aﬀect the mass transfer process. Furthermore, there is
some evidence that acoustic streaming induced by the excitation can also cause
disruption of the diﬀusion boundary layer (Elder 1959, Gould 1966).
Before leaving the subject of rectiﬁed diﬀusion, it is important to emphasize
that the bubble growth that it causes is very slow compared with most of the
other growth processes considered in the last two chapters. It is appropriate
to think of it as causing a gradual, quasistatic change in the equilibrium size
of the bubble, RE. However, it does provide a mechanism by which very small
and stable nuclei might grow suﬃciently to become nuclei for cavitation. It is
also valuable to observe that the Blake threshold pressure, p∞c, increases as
the mass of gas in the bubble, mG, increases (see Equation (2.46)). Therefore,
as mG increases, a smaller reduction in the pressure is necessary to create an
unstable bubble. That is to say, it becomes easier to cavitate the liquid.

BJERKNES FORCES
A diﬀerent nonlinear eﬀect is the force experienced by a bubble in an acoustic
ﬁeld due to the ﬁnite wavelength of the sound waves. The spatial wavenumber

will be denoted by k = ω/cL. The presence of such waves implies an instanta-
neous pressure gradient in the liquid. To model this we substitute
˜p = ˜p∗sin(kxi)
(4.36)
into Equation (4.1) where the constant ˜p∗is the amplitude of the sound waves
and xi is the direction of wave propagation. Like any other pressure gradient,
this produces an instantaneous force, Fi, on the bubble in the xi direction given
by
Fi = −4
3πR3
dp∞
dxi

(4.37)
Since both R and dp∞/dxi contain oscillating components, it follows that the
combination of these in Equation (4.37) will lead to a nonlinear, time-averaged
component in Fi, which we will denote by ¯Fi. Substituting Equations (4.36),
(4.1), and (4.2) into (4.37) yields
¯Fi = −2πR3
ERe{ϕ}k˜p∗cos(kxi)
(4.38)
where the radial oscillation amplitude, ϕ, is given by Equation (4.3) so that
Re{ϕ} =
˜p(ω2 −ω2

(4.39)
If ω is not too close to ωN, a useful approximation is
Re{ϕ} ≈˜p/ρLR2
E(ω2 −ω2
N)
(4.40)
and substituting this into Equation (4.38) yields
¯Fi = −πkRE(˜p∗)2 sin(2kxi)
ρL(ω2 −ω2

(4.41)
This is known as the primary Bjerknes force since it follows from some of the
eﬀects discussed by that author (Bjerknes 1909). The eﬀect was ﬁrst properly
identiﬁed by Blake (1949b).
The form of the primary Bjerknes force produces some interesting bubble
migration patterns in a stationary sound ﬁeld. Note from Equation (4.41) that
if the excitation frequency, ω, is less than the natural frequency, ωN, (or RE <
RR) then the primary Bjerknes force will cause migration of the bubbles away
from the nodes in the pressure ﬁeld and toward the antinodes (points of largest
pressure amplitude). On the other hand, if ω > ωN (or RE > RR) the bubbles
will tend to migrate from the antinodes to the nodes. A number of investigators
(for example, Crum and Eller 1970) have observed the process by which small
bubbles in a stationary sound ﬁeld ﬁrst migrate to the antinodes, where they
grow by rectiﬁed diﬀusion until they are larger than the resonant radius. They
then migrate back to the nodes, where they may dissolve again when they
experience only small pressure oscillations. Crum and Eller (1970) and have

shown that the translational velocities of migrating bubbles are compatible with
the Bjerknes force estimates given above.
Finally, it is important to mention one other nonlinear eﬀect. An acoustic
ﬁeld can cause time-averaged or mean motions in the ﬂuid itself. These are
referred to as acoustic streaming,. The term microstreaming is used to refer to
such motions near a small bubble. Generally these motions take the form of
circulation patterns and, in a classic paper, Elder (1959) observed and recorded
the circulating patterns of microstreaming near the surface of small gas bubbles
in liquids. As stated earlier, these circulation patterns could alter the processes
of heat and mass diﬀusion to or from a bubble and therefore modify phenomena
such as rectiﬁed diﬀusion.

Chapter 5
TRANSLATION OF
BUBBLES
5.1
INTRODUCTION
This chapter will brieﬂy review the issues and problems involved in construct-
ing the equations of motion for individual bubbles (or drops or solid particles)
moving through a ﬂuid and will therefore focus on the dynamics of relative
motion rather than the dynamics of growth and collapse. For convenience we
shall use the generic name “particle” when any or all of bubbles, drops, and
solid particles are being considered.
The analyses are implicitly conﬁned to
those circumstances in which the interactions between neighboring particles are
negligible. In very dilute multiphase ﬂows in which the particles are very small
compared with the global dimensions of the ﬂow and are very far apart com-
pared with the particle size, it is often suﬃcient to solve for the velocity and
pressure, ui(xi, t) and p(xi, t), of the continuous suspending ﬂuid while ignoring
the particles or disperse phase.
Given this solution one could then solve an
equation of motion for the particle to determine its trajectory. This chapter
will focus on the construction of such a particle or bubble equation of motion.
Interactions between particles or, more particularly, bubble, are left for later.
The body of ﬂuid mechanical literature on the subject of ﬂows around parti-
cles or bodies is very large indeed. Here we present a summary that focuses on
a spherical particle of radius, R, and employs the following common notation.
The components of the translational velocity of the center of the particle will be
denoted by Vi(t). The velocity that the ﬂuid would have had at the location of
the particle center in the absence of the particle will be denoted by Ui(t). Note
that such a concept is diﬃcult to extend to the case of interactive multiphase
ﬂows. Finally, the velocity of the particle relative to the ﬂuid is denoted by
Wi(t) = Vi −Ui.
Frequently the approach used to construct equations for Vi(t) (or Wi(t))
given Ui(xi, t) is to individually estimate all the ﬂuid forces acting on the parti-

cle and to equate the total ﬂuid force, Fi, to mpdVi/dt (where mp is the particle
mass, assumed constant). These ﬂuid forces may include forces due to buoyancy,
added mass, drag, etc. In the absence of ﬂuid acceleration (dUi/dt = 0) such an
approach can be made unambigiously; however, in the presence of ﬂuid acceler-
ation, this kind of heuristic approach can be misleading. Hence we concentrate
in the next few sections on a fundamental ﬂuid mechanical approach, which
minimizes possible ambiguities. The classical results for a spherical particle or
bubble are reviewed ﬁrst. The analysis is conﬁned to a suspending ﬂuid that is
incompressible and Newtonian so that the basic equations to be solved are the
continuity equation

where ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the suspending ﬂuid. It
is assumed that the only external force is that due to gravity, g. Then the actual
pressure is p′ = p −ρgz where z is a coordinate measured vertically upward.
Furthermore, in order to maintain clarity we conﬁne attention to rectilinear
relative motion in a direction conveniently chosen to be the x1 direction.

HIGH Re FLOWS AROUND A SPHERE
For steady ﬂows about a sphere in which dUi/dt = dVi/dt = dWi/dt = 0, it is
convenient to use a coordinate system, xi, ﬁxed in the particle as well as polar
coordinates (r, θ) and velocities ur, uθ as deﬁned in Figure 5.1.

where, because of the boundary condition (ur)r=R = 0, it follows that D =
−WR3/2. In potential ﬂow one may also deﬁne a velocity potential, φ, such
that ui = ∂φ/∂xi.
The classic problem with such solutions is the fact that
the drag is zero, a circumstance termed D’Alembert’s paradox.
The ﬂow is
symmetric about the x2x3 plane through the origin and there is no wake.
The real viscous ﬂows around a sphere at large Reynolds numbers, Re =
2WR/ν > 1, are well documented. In the range from about 103 to 3 × 105,
laminar boundary layer separation occurs at θ ∼= 84◦and a large wake is formed
behind the sphere (see Figure 5.2).
Close to the sphere the “near-wake” is
laminar; further downstream transition and turbulence occurring in the shear
layers spreads to generate a turbulent “far-wake.” As the Reynolds number
increases the shear layer transition moves forward until, quite abruptly, the
turbulent shear layer reattaches to the body, resulting in a major change in

right) past a sphere showing, at the top, laminar separation at Re = 2.8 × 105

the ﬁnal position of separation (θ ∼= 120◦) and in the form of the turbulent
wake (Figure 5.2). Associated with this change in ﬂow pattern is a dramatic
decrease in the drag coeﬃcient, CD (deﬁned as the drag force on the body in the
negative x1 direction divided by 1
2ρW 2πR2), from a value of about 0.5 in the
laminar separation regime to a value of about 0.2 in the turbulent separation
regime (Figure 5.3). At values of Re less than about 103 the ﬂow becomes quite
unsteady with periodic shedding of vortices from the sphere.
5.3
LOW Re FLOWS AROUND A SPHERE
At the other end of the Reynolds number spectrum is the classic Stokes solution
for ﬂow around a sphere. In this limit the terms on the left-hand side of Equation

(5.14)
Several subcases of this solution are of interest in the present context.
The
ﬁrst is the classic Stokes (1851) solution for a solid sphere in which the no-
slip boundary condition, (uθ)r=R = 0, is applied (in addition to the kinematic
condition (ur)r=R = 0). This set of boundary conditions, referred to as the
Stokes boundary conditions, leads to
A = −WR3
4
,
B = +3WR
4
and
F1 = −6πρνWR
(5.15)
The second case originates with Hadamard (1911) and Rybczynski (1911) who
suggested that, in the case of a bubble, a condition of zero shear stress on the
sphere surface would be more appropriate than a condition of zero tangential
velocity, uθ. Then it transpires that
A = 0
,
B = +WR
2
and
F1 = −4πρνWR
(5.16)

Real bubbles may conform to either the Stokes or Hadamard-Rybczynski so-
lutions depending on the degree of contamination of the bubble surface, as we
shall discuss in more detail in the next section. Finally, it is of interest to ob-
serve that the potential ﬂow solution given in Equations (5.7) to (5.10) is also
a subcase with
A = +WR3
2
,
B = 0
and
F1 = 0
(5.17)
However, another paradox, known as the Whitehead paradox, arises when the
validity of these Stokes ﬂow solutions at small (rather than zero) Reynolds
numbers is considered. The nature of this paradox can be demonstrated by ex-
amining the magnitude of the neglected term, uj∂ui/∂xj, in the Navier-Stokes
equations relative to the magnitude of the retained term ν∂2ui/∂xj∂xj. As is
evident from Equation (5.11), far from the sphere the former is proportional
to W 2R/r2 whereas the latter behaves like νWR/r3. It follows that although
the retained term will dominate close to the body (provided the Reynolds num-
ber Re = 2WR/ν ≪1), there will always be a radial position, rc, given by
R/rc = Re beyond which the neglected term will exceed the retained viscous
term. Hence, even if Re ≪1, the Stokes solution is not uniformly valid. Rec-
ognizing this limitation, Oseen (1910) attempted to correct the Stokes solution
by retaining in the basic equation an approximation to uj∂ui/∂xj that would
be valid in the far ﬁeld, −W∂ui/∂x1. Thus the Navier-Stokes equations are
approximated by
−W ∂ui
∂x1
= −1
ρ
∂p
∂xi
+ ν
∂2ui

(5.18)
Oseen was able to ﬁnd a closed form solution to this equation that satisﬁes the
Stokes boundary conditions approximately:

(5.19)
which yields a drag force
F1 = −6πρνWR

1 + 3
16 Re

(5.20)
It is readily shown that Equation (5.19) reduces to (5.11) as Re →0. The
corresponding solution for the Hadamard-Rybczynski boundary conditions is
not known to the author; its validity would be more questionable since, unlike
the case of Stokes’ boundary conditions, the inertial terms uj∂ui/∂xj are not
identically zero on the surface of the bubble.
More recently Proudman and Pearson (1957) and Kaplun and Lagerstrom
(1957) showed that Oseen’s solution is, in fact, the ﬁrst term obtained when
the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used in an attempt to patch
together consistent asymptotic solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations for

both the near ﬁeld close to the sphere and the far ﬁeld. They also obtained the
next term in the expression for the drag force.

The additional term leads to an error of 1% at Re = 0.3 and does not, therefore,
have much practical consequence.
The most notable feature of the Oseen solution is that the geometry of the
streamlines depends on the Reynolds number. The downstream ﬂow is not a
mirror image of the upstream ﬂow as in the Stokes or potential ﬂow solutions.
Indeed, closer examination of the Oseen solution reveals that, downstream of
the sphere, the streamlines are further apart and the ﬂow is slower than in the
equivalent upstream location. Furthermore, this eﬀect increases with Reynolds
number. These features of the Oseen solution are entirely consistent with ex-
perimental observations and represent the initial development of a wake behind
the body.
The ﬂow past a sphere at Reynolds numbers between about 0.5 and several
thousand has proven intractable to analytical methods though numerical solu-
tions are numerous. Experimentally, it is found that a recirculating zone (or
vortex ring) develops close to the rear stagnation point at about Re = 30 (see
Taneda 1956 and Figure 5.4). With further increase in the Reynolds number
this recirculating zone or wake expands. Deﬁning locations on the surface by
the angle from the front stagnation point, the separation point moves forward
from about 130◦at Re = 100 to about 115◦at Re = 300. In the process the
wake reaches a diameter comparable to that of the sphere when Re ≈130. At
this point the ﬂow becomes unstable and the ring vortex that makes up the
wake begins to oscillate (Taneda 1956). However, it continues to be attached to
the sphere until about Re = 500 (Torobin and Gauvin 1959).
At Reynolds numbers above about 500, vortices begin to be shed and then
convected downstream. The frequency of vortex shedding has not been studied
as extensively as in the case of a circular cylinder and seems to vary more with
Reynolds number. In terms of the conventional Strouhal number, St, deﬁned
as
St = 2fR/W
(5.22)
the vortex shedding frequencies, f, that Moller (1938) observed correspond to a
range of St varying from 0.3 at Re = 1000 to about 1.8 at Re = 5000. Further-
more, as Re increases above 500 the ﬂow develops a fairly steady “near-wake”
behind which vortex shedding forms an unsteady and increasingly turbulent
“far-wake.” This process continues until, at a value of Re of the order of 1000,
the ﬂow around the sphere and in the near-wake again becomes quite steady.
A recognizable boundary layer has developed on the front of the sphere and
separation settles down to a position about 84◦from the front stagnation point.
Transition to turbulence occurs on the free shear layer, which deﬁnes the bound-
ary of the near-wake and moves progessively forward as the Reynolds number
increases. The ﬂow is similar to that of the top picture in Figure 5.2. Then

Re = 9.15
Re = 37.7
Re = 17.9
Re = 73.6
Re = 25.5
Re = 118

the events described in the previous section occur with further increase in the
Reynolds number.
Since the Reynolds number range between 0.5 and several hundred can often
pertain in multiphase ﬂows, one must resort to an empirical formula for the drag
force in this regime. A number of empirical results are available; for example,
Klyachko (1934) recommends

which ﬁts the data fairly well up to Re ≈1000. At Re = 1 the factor in the
square brackets is 1.167, whereas the same factor in Equation (5.20) is 1.187.
On the other hand, at Re = 1000, the two factors are respectively 17.7 and
188.5.
5.4
MARANGONI EFFECTS
As a postscript to the steady, viscous ﬂows of the last section, it is of interest to
introduce and describe the forces that a bubble may experience due to gradients
in the surface tension, S, over the surface. These are called Marangoni eﬀects.
The gradients in the surface tension can be caused by a number of diﬀerent
factors. For example, gradients in the temperature, solvent concentration, or
electric potential can create gradients in the surface tension. The “thermocap-
illary” eﬀects due to temperature gradients have been explored by a number
of investigators (for example, Young, Goldstein, and Block 1959) because of
their importance in several technological contexts.
For most of the range of
temperatures, the surface tension decreases linearly with temperature, reaching
zero at the critical point. Consequently, the controlling thermophysical prop-
erty, dS/dT, is readily identiﬁed and more or less constant for any given ﬂuid.
Some typical data for dS/dT is presented in Table 5.1 and reveals a remarkably
uniform value for this quantity for a wide range of liquids.
Surface tension gradients aﬀect free surface ﬂows because a gradient, dS/ds,
in a direction, s, tangential to a surface clearly requires that a shear stress act
in the negative s direction in order that the surface be in equilibrium. Such
a shear stress would then modify the boundary conditions (for example, the
Hadamard-Rybczynski conditions used in the preceding section), thus altering
the ﬂow and the forces acting on the bubble.
As an example of the Marangoni eﬀect, we will examine the steady motion
of a spherical bubble in a viscous ﬂuid when there exists a gradient of the
temperature (or other controlling physical property), dT/dx1, in the direction
of motion (see Figure 5.1). We must ﬁrst determine whether the temperature (or
other controlling property) is aﬀected by the ﬂow. It is illustrative to consider
two special cases from a spectrum of possibilities. The ﬁrst and simplest special
case, which is not so relevant to the thermocapillary phenomenon, is to assume
that T = (dT/dx1)x1 throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld so that, on the surface of the

Much more realistic is the assumption that thermal conduction dominates the
heat transfer (∇2T = 0) and that there is no heat transfer through the surface
of the bubble. Then it follows from the solution of Laplace’s equation for the

The latter is the solution presented by Young, Goldstein, and Block (1959), but
it diﬀers from Equation (5.24) only in terms of the eﬀective value of dS/dT.
Here we shall employ Equation (5.25) since we focus on thermocapillarity, but
other possibilities such as Equation (5.24) should be borne in mind.
For simplicity we will continue to assume that the bubble remains spherical.
This assumption implies that the surface tension diﬀerences are small compared
with the absolute level of S and that the stresses normal to the surface are
entirely dominated by the surface tension.
With these assumptions the tangential stress boundary condition for the
spherical bubble becomes

and this should replace the Hadamard-Rybczynski condition of zero shear stress
that was used in the preceding section. Applying Equation (5.26) with Equation
(5.25) and the usual kinematic condition, (ur)r=R = 0, to the general solution
of the preceding section leads to

and consequently, from Equation (5.14), the force acting on the bubble becomes
F1 = −4πρLνLWR −2πR2 dS
dx1
(5.28)
In addition to the normal Hadamard-Rybczynski drag (ﬁrst term), we can iden-
tify a Marangoni force, 2πR2(dS/dx1), acting on the bubble in the direction of
decreasing surface tension. Thus, for example, the presence of a uniform tem-
perature gradient, dT/dx1, would lead to an additional force on the bubble of
magnitude 2πR2(−dS/dT)(dT/dx1) in the direction of the warmer ﬂuid since
the surface tension decreases with temperature. Such thermocapillary eﬀects
have been observed and measured by Young, Goldstein, and Block (1959) and
others.
Finally, we should comment on a related eﬀect caused by surface contam-
inants that increase the surface tension.
When a bubble is moving through
liquid under the action, say, of gravity, convection may cause contaminants to
accumulate on the downstream side of the bubble. This will create a positive
dS/dθ gradient which, in turn, will generate an eﬀective shear stress acting in
a direction opposite to the ﬂow. Consequently, the contaminants tend to im-
mobilize the surface. This will cause the ﬂow and the drag to change from the
Hadamard-Rybczynski solution to the Stokes solution for zero tangential veloc-
ity. The eﬀect is more pronounced for smaller bubbles since, for a given surface
tension diﬀerence, the Marangoni force becomes larger relative to the buoyancy
force as the bubble size decreases.
Experimentally, this means that surface
contamination usually results in Stokes drag for spherical bubbles smaller than
a certain size and in Hadamard-Rybczynski drag for spherical bubbles larger
than that size. Such a transition is observed in experiments measuring the rise
velocity of bubbles as, for example, in the Haberman and Morton (1953) exper-
iments discussed in more detail in Section 5.12. The eﬀect has been analyzed in
the more complex hydrodynamic case at higher Reynolds numbers by Harper,
Moore, and Pearson (1967).
5.5
MOLECULAR EFFECTS
Though only rarely important in the context of bubbles, there are some eﬀects
that can be caused by the molecular motions in the surrounding ﬂuid. We brieﬂy
list some of these here.
When the mean free path of the molecules in the surrounding ﬂuid, λ, be-
comes comparable with the size of the particles, the ﬂow will clearly deviate
from the continuum models, which are only relevant when λ ≪R. The Knud-
sen number, Kn = λ/2R, is used to characterize these circumstances, and
Cunningham (1910) showed that the ﬁrst-order correction for small but ﬁnite
Knudsen number leads to an additional factor, (1 + 2AKn), in the Stokes drag
for a spherical particle. The numerical factor, A, is roughly a constant of order
unity (see, for example, Green and Lane 1964).

When the impulse generated by the collision of a single ﬂuid molecule with
the particle is large enough to cause signiﬁcant change in the particle velocity,
the resulting random motions of the particle are called “Brownian motion”
(Einstein 1956). This leads to diﬀusion of solid particles suspended in a ﬂuid.
Einstein showed that the diﬀusivity, D, of this process is given by
D = kT/6πµR
(5.29)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant. It follows that the typical rms displacement,
λ, of the particle in a time, t, is given by
λ = (kTt/3πµR)
1
2
(5.30)
Brownian motion is usually only signiﬁcant for micron- and sub-micron-sized
particles. The example quoted by Einstein is that of a 1 µm diameter particle
in water at 17◦C for which the typical displacement during one second is 0.8 µm.
A third, related phenomenon is the reponse of a particle to the collisions of
molecules when there is a signiﬁcant temperature gradient in the ﬂuid. Then
the impulses imparted to the particle by molecular collisions on the hot side
of the particle will be larger than the impulses on the cold side. The particle
will therefore experience a net force driving it in the direction of the colder
ﬂuid. This phenomenon is known as thermophoresis (see, for example, Davies
1966). A similar phenomenon known as photophoresis occurs when a particle is
subjected to nonuniform radiation. One could, of course, include in this list the
Bjerknes forces described in Section 4.10 since they constitute sonophoresis.
5.6
UNSTEADY PARTICLE MOTIONS
Having reviewed the steady motion of a particle relative to a ﬂuid, we must now
consider the consequences of unsteady relative motion in which either the par-
ticle or the ﬂuid or both are accelerating. The complexities of ﬂuid acceleration
are delayed until the next section. First we shall consider the simpler circum-
stance in which the ﬂuid is either at rest or has a steady uniform streaming
motion (U = constant) far from the particle. Clearly the second case is readily
reduced to the ﬁrst by a simple Galilean transformation and it will be assumed
that this has been accomplished.
In the ideal case of unsteady inviscid potential ﬂow, it can then be shown
by using the concept of the total kinetic energy of the ﬂuid that the force on a
rigid particle in an incompressible ﬂow is given by Fi, where
Fi = −Mij
dVj
dt
(5.31)
where Mij is called the added mass matrix (or tensor) though the name “induced
inertia tensor” used by Batchelor (1967) is, perhaps, more descriptive.
The
reader is referred to Sarpkaya and Isaacson (1981), Yih (1969), or Batchelor
(1967) for detailed descriptions of such analyses. The above mentioned methods

also show that Mij for any ﬁnite particle can be obtained from knowledge of
several steady potential ﬂows. In fact,
Mij = ρ


volume
of fluid
uikujk d(volume)
(5.32)
where the integration is performed over the entire volume of the ﬂuid. The
velocity ﬁeld, uij, is the ﬂuid velocity in the i direction caused by the steady
translation of the particle with unit velocity in the j direction. Note that this
means that Mij is necessarily a symmetric matrix. Furthermore, it is clear that
particles with planes of symmetry will not experience a force perpendicular to
that plane when the direction of acceleration is parallel to that plane. Hence if
there is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the k direction, then for i ̸= k,
Mki = Mik = 0, and the only oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements that can be nonzero
are Mij, j ̸= k, i ̸= k. In the special case of the sphere all the oﬀ-diagonal terms
will be zero.
Tables of some available values of the diagonal components of Mij are given
by Sarpkaya and Isaacson (1981) who also summarize the experimental results,
particularly for planar ﬂows past cylinders. Other compilations of added mass
results can be found in Kennard (1967), Patton (1965), and Brennen (1982).
Some typical values for three-dimensional particles are listed in Table ??. The
uniform diagonal value for a sphere (often referred to simply as the added mass
of a sphere) is 2ρπR3/3 or one-half the displaced mass of ﬂuid. This value can
readily be obtained from Equation (5.32) using the steady ﬂow results given
in Equations (5.7) to (5.10). In general, of course, there is no special relation
between the added mass and the displaced mass. Consider, for example, the
case of the inﬁnitely thin plate or disc with zero displaced mass which has a
ﬁnite added mass in the direction normal to the surface.
Finally, it should
be noted that the literature contains little, if any, information on oﬀ-diagonal
components of added mass matrices.
Now consider the application of these potential ﬂow results to real viscous
ﬂows at high Reynolds numbers (the case of low Reynolds number ﬂows will
be discussed in Section 5.8). Signiﬁcant doubts about the applicability of the
added masses calculated from potential ﬂow analysis would be justiﬁed because
of the experience of D’Alembert’s paradox for steady potential ﬂows and the
substantial diﬀerence between the streamlines of the potential and actual ﬂows.
Furthermore, analyses of experimental results will require the separation of the
“added mass” forces from the viscous drag forces. Usually this is accomplished
by heuristic summation of the two forces so that
Fi = −Mij
dVj
dt −1
2ρACij|Vj|Vj
(5.33)
where Cij is a lift and drag coeﬃcient matrix and A is a typical cross-sectional
area for the body.
This is known as Morison’s equation (see Morison et al.
1950).
Actual unsteady high Reynolds number ﬂows are more complicated and not
necessarily compatible with such simple superposition. This is reﬂected in the

Table 2.1. Added masses (diagonal terms in Mij) for some three-dimensional
bodies (particles): (T) Potential ﬂow calculations, (E) Experimental data from
Patton (1965).
fact that the coeﬃcients, Mij and Cij, appear from the experimental results to
be not only functions of Re but also functions of the reduced time or frequency of
the unsteady motion. Typically experiments involve either oscillation of a body
in a ﬂuid or acceleration from rest. The most extensively studied case involves
planar ﬂow past a cylinder (for example, Keulegan and Carpenter 1958), and
a detailed review of this data is included in Sarkaya and Isaacson (1981). For
oscillatory motion of the cylinder with velocity amplitude, UM , and period, t∗,
the coeﬃcients are functions of both the Reynolds number, Re = 2UMR/ν, and
the reduced period or Keulegan-Carpenter number, Kc = UMt∗/2R. When the
amplitude, UM t∗, is less than about 10R (Kc < 5), the inertial eﬀects dominate
and Mii is only a little less than its potential ﬂow value over a wide range of

Reynolds numbers (104 < Re < 106). However, for larger values of Kc, Mii
can be substantially smaller than this and, in some range of Re and Kc, may
actually be negative. The values of Cii (the drag coeﬃcient) that are deduced
from experiments are also a complicated function of Re and Kc. The behavior of
the coeﬃcients is particularly pathological when the reduced period, Kc, is close
to that of vortex shedding (Kc of the order of 10). Large transverse or “lift”
forces can be generated under these circumstances. To the author’s knowledge,
detailed investigations of this kind have not been made for a spherical body, but
one might expect the same qualitative phenomena to occur.
5.7
UNSTEADY POTENTIAL FLOW
In general, a particle moving in any ﬂow other than a steady uniform stream will
experience ﬂuid accelerations, and it is therefore necessary to consider the struc-
ture of the equation governing the particle motion under these circumstances.
Of course, this will include the special case of acceleration of a particle in a
ﬂuid at rest (or with a steady streaming motion). As in the earlier sections we
shall conﬁne the detailed solutions to those for a spherical particle or bubble.
Furthermore, we consider only those circumstances in which both the particle
and ﬂuid acceleration are in one direction, chosen for convenience to be the x1
direction. The eﬀect of an external force ﬁeld such as gravity will be omitted;
it can readily be inserted into any of the solutions that follow by the addition
of the conventional buoyancy force.
All the solutions discussed are obtained in an accelerating frame of reference
ﬁxed in the center of the ﬂuid particle. Therefore, if the velocity of the particle
in some original, noninertial coordinate system, x∗
i , was V (t) in the x∗
1 direction,
the Navier-Stokes equations in the new frame, xi, ﬁxed in the particle center
are

(5.34)
where the pseudo-pressure, P , is related to the actual pressure, p, by
P = p + ρx1
dV
dt
(5.35)
Here the conventional time derivative of V (t) is denoted by d/dt, but it should be
noted that in the original x∗
i frame it implies a Lagrangian derivative following
the particle. As before, the ﬂuid is assumed incompressible (so that continuity
requires ∂ui/∂xi = 0) and Newtonian. The velocity that the ﬂuid would have
at the xi origin in the absence of the particle is then W(t) in the x1 direction.
It is also convenient to deﬁne the quantities r, θ, ur, uθ as shown in Figure 5.1
and the Stokes streamfunction as in Equations (5.6). In some cases we shall
also be able to consider the unsteady eﬀects due to growth of the bubble so the
radius is denoted by R(t).

First consider inviscid potential ﬂow for which Equations (5.34) may be
integrated to obtain the Bernoulli equation

The ﬁrst part, which involves W and D, is identical to that for steady transla-
tion. The second, involving A and B, will provide the ﬂuid velocity gradient in
the x1 direction, and the third, involving E, permits a time-dependent particle
(bubble) radius. The W and A terms represent the ﬂuid ﬂow in the absence of
the particle, and the D, B, and E terms allow the boundary condition

to be satisﬁed provided

In the absence of the particle the velocity of the ﬂuid at the origin, r = 0, is
simply −W in the x1 direction and the gradient of the velocity ∂u1/∂x1 = 4A/3.
Hence A is determined from the ﬂuid velocity gradient in the original frame as

Equation 5.47 is an important result, and care must be taken not to confuse the
diﬀerent time derivatives contained in it. Note that in the absence of bubble

from setting F1 = mpdV/dt∗is

where mp is the mass of the “particle.” Thus for a massless bubble the acceler-
ation of the bubble is three times the ﬂuid acceleration.
In a more comprehensive study of unsteady potential ﬂows Symington (1978)
has shown that the result for more general (i.e., noncolinear) accelerations of
the ﬂuid and particle is merely the vector equivalent of Equation (5.47):
Fi = −1

(5.52)
The ﬁrst term in Equation (5.51) represents the conventional added mass eﬀect
due to the particle acceleration. The factor 3/2 in the second term due to the
ﬂuid acceleration may initially seem surprising. However, it is made up of two
components:
1.
1
2ρdVi/dt∗, which is the added mass eﬀect of the ﬂuid acceleration
2. ρτDUi/Dt∗, which is a “buoyancy”-like force due to the pressure gradient
associated with the ﬂuid acceleration.

The last term in Equation (5.51) is caused by particle (bubble) volumetric
growth, dτ/dt∗, and is similar in form to the force on a source in a uniform
stream.
Now it is necessary to ask how this force given by Equation (5.51) should be
used in the practical construction of an equation of motion for a particle. Fre-
quently, a viscous drag force F D
i , is quite arbitrarily added to Fi to obtain some
total “eﬀective” force on the particle. Drag forces, F D

(5.54)
have both been employed in the literature. It is, however, important to recognize
that there is no fundamental analytical justiﬁcation for such superposition of
these forces.
At high Reynolds numbers, we noted in the last section that
experimentally observed added masses are indeed quite close to those predicted
by potential ﬂow within certain parametric regimes, and hence the superposition
has some experimental justiﬁcation. At low Reynolds numbers, it is improper
to use the results of the potential ﬂow analysis. The appropriate analysis under
these circumstances is examined in the next section.
5.8
UNSTEADY STOKES FLOW
In order to elucidate some of the issues raised in the last section, it is instructive
to examine solutions for the unsteady ﬂow past a sphere in low Reynolds number
Stokes ﬂow. In the asymptotic case of zero Reynolds number, the solution of
Section 5.3 is unchanged by unsteadiness, and hence the solution at any instant
in time is identical to the steady-ﬂow solution for the same particle velocity.
In other words, since the ﬂuid has no inertia, it is always in static equilibrium.
Thus the instantaneous force is identical to that for the steady ﬂow with the
same Vi(t).
The next step is therefore to investigate the eﬀects of small but nonzero
inertial contributions. The Oseen solution provides some indication of the eﬀect
of the convective inertial terms, uj∂ui/∂xj, in steady ﬂow. Here we investigate
the eﬀects of the unsteady inertial term, ∂ui/∂t. Ideally it would be best to
include both the ∂ui/∂t term and the Oseen approximation to the convective
term, U∂ui/∂x. However, the resulting unsteady Oseen ﬂow is suﬃciently dif-
ﬁcult that only small-time expansions for the impulsively started motions of
droplets and bubbles exist in the literature (Pearcey and Hill 1956).
Consider, therefore the unsteady Stokes equations in the absence of the con-
vective inertial terms:
ρ∂ui
∂t = −∂P
∂xi
+ µ ∂2ui
∂xj∂xj
(5.55)
Since both the equations and the boundary conditions used below are linear in
ui, we need only consider colinear particle and ﬂuid velocities in one direction,

say x1. The solution to the general case of noncolinear particle and ﬂuid veloc-
ities and accelerations may then be obtained by superposition. As in Section
5.7 the colinear problem is solved by ﬁrst transforming to an accelerating coor-
dinate frame, xi, ﬁxed in the center of the particle so that P = p + ρx1dV/dt.
Elimination of P by taking the curl of Equation (5.55) leads to
(L −1
ν
∂
∂t)Lψ = 0
(5.56)
where L is the same operator as deﬁned in Equation (5.37). Guided by both the
steady Stokes ﬂow and the unsteady potential ﬂow solution, one can anticipate
a solution of the form
ψ = sin2 θ f(r, t) + cos θ sin2 θ g(r, t) + cos θ h(t)
(5.57)
plus other spherical harmonic functions. The ﬁrst term has the form of the
steady Stokes ﬂow solution; the last term would be required if the particle were
a growing spherical bubble. After substituting Equation (5.57) into Equation
(5.56), the equations for f, g, h are

It transpires that this is independent of g or h.
Hence only the solution to
Equation (5.58) for f(r, t) need be sought in order to ﬁnd the force on a spherical
particle, and the other spherical harmonics that might have been included in
Equation (5.57) are now seen to be unnecessary.
Fourier or Laplace transform methods may be used to solve Equation (5.58)
for f(r, t), and we choose Laplace transforms. The Laplace transforms for the
relative velocity W(t), and the function f(r, t) are denoted by ˆW(s) and ˆf(r, s):

then the general force on the particle or bubble in unsteady Stokes ﬂow when
the Stokes boundary conditions are applied.
Compare this result with that obtained from the potential ﬂow analysis,
Equation (5.51) with τ taken as constant. It is striking to observe that the
coeﬃcients of the added mass terms involving dVi/dt∗and dUi/dt∗are identical
to those of the potential ﬂow solution. On superﬁcial examination it might be
noted that dUi/dt∗appears in Equation (5.71) whereas DUi/Dt∗appears in
(5.51); the diﬀerence is, however, of order Wj∂Ui/dxj and terms of this order
have already been dropped from the equation of motion on the basis that they
were negligible compared with the temporal derivatives like ∂Wi/∂t.
Hence
it is inconsistent with the initial assumption to distinguish between d/dt∗and
D/Dt∗in the present unsteady Stokes ﬂow solution.
The term 9νW/2R2 in Equation (5.71) is, of course, the steady Stokes drag.
The new phenomenon introduced by this analysis is contained in the last term
of Equation (5.71).
This is a fading memory term that is often named the
Basset term after one of its identiﬁers (Basset 1888). It results from the fact
that additional vorticity created at the solid particle surface due to relative
acceleration diﬀuses into the ﬂow and creates a temporary perturbation in the
ﬂow ﬁeld. Like all diﬀusive eﬀects it produces an ω
1
2 term in the equation for
oscillatory motion.
Before we conclude this section, comment should be included on two other
analytical results.
Morrison and Stewart (1976) have considered the case of
a spherical bubble for which the Hadamard-Rybczynski boundary conditions
rather than the Stokes conditions are applied. Then, instead of the conditions
of Equation (5.67), the conditions for zero normal velocity and zero shear stress
on the surface require that

Comparing this with the solution for the Stokes conditions, we note that the
ﬁrst two terms are unchanged and the third term is the expected Hadamard-
Rybczynski steady drag term (see Equation (5.16)). The last term is signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent from the Basset term in Equation (5.71) but still represents a
receding memory.
The second interesting case is that for unsteady Oseen ﬂow, which essentially
consists of attempting to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the convective
initial terms approximated by Uj∂ui/∂xj. Pearcey and Hill (1956) have exam-
ined the small-time behavior of droplets and bubbles started from rest when
this term is included in the equations.
5.9
GROWING OR COLLAPSING BUBBLES
We now return to the discussion of higher Re ﬂow and speciﬁcally address the
eﬀects due to bubble growth or collapse.
A bubble that grows or collapses
close to a boundary may undergo translation due to the asymmetry induced
by that boundary. A relatively simple example of the analysis of this class of
ﬂows is the case of the growth or collapse of a spherical bubble near a plane
boundary, a problem ﬁrst solved by Herring (1941) (see also Davies and Taylor
1942, 1943). Assuming that the only translational motion of the bubble (with
velocity, W) is perpendicular to the plane boundary, the geometry of the bubble
and its image in the boundary will be as shown in Figure 5.5. For convenience,
we deﬁne additional polar cooordinates, (˘r, ˘θ), with origin at the center of the
image bubble. Assuming inviscid, irrotational ﬂow, Herring (1941) and Davies
and Taylor (1943) constructed the velocity potential, φ, near the bubble by
considering an expansion in terms of R/h where h is the distance of the bubble
center from the boundary.
Neglecting all terms that are of order R3/h3 or
higher, the velocity potential can be obtained by superposing the individual
contributions from the bubble source/sink, the image source/sink, the bubble
translation dipole, the image dipole, and one correction factor described below.
This combination yields

(5.76)
The ﬁrst and third terms are the source/sink contributions from the bubble and
the image respectively. The second and fourth terms are the dipole contributions
due to the translation of the bubble and the image. The last term arises because
the source/sink in the bubble needs to be displaced from the bubble center by
an amount R3/8h2 normal to the wall in order to satisfy the boundary condition
on the surface of the bubble to order R2/h2. All other terms of order R3/h3
or higher are neglected in this analysis assuming that the bubble is suﬃciently
far from the boundary so that h ≫R. Finally, the sign choice on the last three
terms of Equation (5.76) is as follows: the upper, positive sign pertains to the
case of a solid boundary and the lower, negative sign provides an approximate
solution for a free surface boundary.

Figure 5.5: Schematic of a bubble undergoing growth or collapse close to a plane
boundary. The associated translational velocity is denoted by W.
It remains to use this solution to determine the translational motion, W(t),
normal to the boundary. This is accomplished by invoking the condition that
there is no net force on the bubble. Using the unsteady Bernoulli equation and
the velocity potential and ﬂuid velocities obtained from Equation (5.76), Davies
and Taylor (1943) evaluate the pressure at the bubble surface and thereby obtain
an expression for the force, Fx, on the bubble in the x direction:

In the absence of gravity this corresponds to the equation of motion ﬁrst ob-
tained by Herring (1941). Many of the studies of growing and collapsing bubbles
near boundaries have been carried out in the context of underwater explosions
(see Cole 1948). An example illustrating the solution of Equation (5.78) and the
comparison with experimental data is included in Figure 5.6 taken from Davies
and Taylor (1943).
Another application of this analysis is to the translation of cavitation bubbles
near walls. Here the motivation is to understand the development of impulsive
loads on the solid surface (see Section 3.6), and therefore the primary focus is
on bubbles close to the wall so that the solution described above is of limited
value since it requires h ≫R. However, as discussed in Section 3.5, considerable
progress has been made in recent years in developing analytical methods for the
solution of the inviscid free surface ﬂows of bubbles near boundaries. One of

Figure 5.6: Data from Davies and Taylor (1943) on the mean radius and central
elevation of a bubble in oil generated by a spark-initiated explosion of 1.32 ×
106 ergs situated 6.05 cm below the free surface.
The two measures of the
bubble radius are one half of the horizontal span (△) and one quarter of the
sum of the horizontal and vertical spans (⊙). Theoretical calculations using
Equation (5.78) are indicated by the solid lines.
the concepts that is particularly useful in determining the direction of bubble
translation is based on a property of the ﬂow ﬁrst introduced by Kelvin (see
Lamb 1932) and called the Kelvin impulse. This vector property applies to the
ﬂow generated by a ﬁnite particle or bubble in a ﬂuid; it is denoted by IKi and
deﬁned by
IKi = ρ

SB
φnidS
(5.79)
where φ is the velocity potential of the irrotational ﬂow, SB is the surface of the
bubble, and ni is the outward normal at that surface (deﬁned as positive into
the bubble). If one visualizes a bubble in a ﬂuid at rest, then the Kelvin impulse
is the impulse that would have to be applied to the bubble in order to generate
the motions of the ﬂuid related to the bubble motion.
Benjamin and Ellis
(1966) were the ﬁrst to demonstrate the value of this property in determining
the interaction between a growing or collapsing bubble and a nearby boundary
(see also Blake and Gibson 1987).
5.10
EQUATION OF MOTION
In a multiphase ﬂow with a very dilute discrete phase the ﬂuid forces discussed in
Sections 5.1 to 5.8 will determine the motion of the particles that constitute that

discrete phase. In this section we discuss the implications of some of the ﬂuid
force terms. The equation that determines the particle velocity, Vi, is generated
by equating the total force, F T
i , on the particle to mpdVi/dt∗. Consider the
motion of a spherical particle or (bubble) of mass mp and volume τ (radius R)
in a uniformly accelerating ﬂuid. The simplest example of this is the vertical
motion of a particle under gravity, g, in a pool of otherwise quiescent ﬂuid. Thus
the results will be written in terms of the buoyancy force. However, the same
results apply to motion generated by any uniform acceleration of the ﬂuid, and
hence g can be interpreted as a general uniform ﬂuid acceleration (dU/dt). This
will also allow some tentative conclusions to be drawn concerning the relative
motion of a particle in the nonuniformly accelerating ﬂuid situations that can
occur in general multiphase ﬂow. For the motion of a sphere at small relative
Reynolds number, ReW ≪1 (where ReW = 2WR/ν and W is the typical
magnitude of the relative velocity), only the forces due to buoyancy and the
weight of the particle need be added to Fi as given by Equations (5.71) or
(5.75) in order to obtain F T
i . This addition is simply given by (ρτ −mp)gi
where g is a vector in the vertically upward direction with magnitude equal to
the acceleration due to gravity. On the other hand, at high relative Reynolds
numbers, ReW ≫1, one must resort to a more heuristic approach in which
the ﬂuid forces given by Equation (5.51) are supplemented by drag (and lift)
forces given by 1
2ρACij|Wj|Wj as in Equation (5.33). In either case it is useful
to nondimensionalize the resulting equation of motion so that the pertinent
nondimensional parameters can be identiﬁed.
Examine ﬁrst the case in which the relative velocity, W (deﬁned as positive
in the direction of the acceleration, g, and therefore positive in the vertically
upward direction of the rising bubble or sedimenting particle), is suﬃciently
small so that the relative Reynolds number is much less than unity. Then, using
the Stokes boundary conditions, the equation governing W may be obtained
from Equation (5.70) as

and w = W/W∞where W∞is the steady terminal velocity given by
W∞= 2R2g(1 −mp/ρτ)/9ν
(5.82)
In the absence of the Basset term the solution of Equation (5.80) is simply
w = 1 −e−t/tR
(5.83)
and the typical response time, tR, is called the relaxation time for particle
velocity (see, for example, Rudinger 1969). In the general case that includes

the Basset term the dimensionless solution, w(t∗), of Equation (5.80) depends
only on the parameter mp/ρτ (particle mass/displaced ﬂuid mass) appearing in
the Basset term. Indeed, the dimensionless Equation (5.80) clearly illustrates
the fact that the Basset term is much less important for solid particles in a gas
where mp/ρτ ≫1 than it is for bubbles in a liquid where mp/ρτ ≪1. Note
also that for initial conditions of zero relative velocity (w(0) = 0) the small-time
solution of Equation (5.80) takes the form
w = t∗−

Hence the initial acceleration at t = 0 is given dimensionally by 2g(1−mp/ρτ)/(1+
2mp/ρτ) or 2g in the case of a massless bubble and −g in the case of a heavy
solid particle in a gas where mp ≫ρτ. Note also that the eﬀect of the Basset
term is to reduce the acceleration of the relative motion, thus increasing the
time required to achieve terminal velocity.
Numerical solutions of the form of w(t∗) for various mp/ρτ are shown in
Figure 5.7 where the delay caused by the Basset term can be clearly seen. In
fact in the later stages of approach to the terminal velocity the Basset term
dominates over the added mass term, (dw/dt∗).
The integral in the Basset
term becomes approximately 2t

altered Basset term leads to a more rapid approach to terminal velocity than
occurs for the Stokes boundary condition, the diﬀerence is not qualitatively
signiﬁcant.
If the terminal Reynolds number is much greater than unity then, in the
absence of particle growth, Equation (5.51) heuristically supplemented with a
drag force of the form of Equation (5.53) leads to the following equation of
motion for unidirectional motion:

case.
For the purposes of reference in Section 5.12 note that, if we deﬁne a

or, alternatively, if CD is deﬁned as 4/3F r2, then it could be written as
F ∗(Re, CD) = 0

5.11
MAGNITUDE OF RELATIVE MOTION
Qualitative estimates of the magnitude of the relative motion in multiphase
ﬂows can be made from the analyses of the last section. Consider a general
steady ﬂuid ﬂow characterized by a velocity, U, and a typical dimension, ℓ; it
may, for example, be useful to visualize the ﬂow in a converging nozzle of length,
ℓ, and mean axial velocity, U. A particle in this ﬂow will experience a typical
ﬂuid acceleration (or eﬀective g) of U 2/ℓfor a typical time given by ℓ/U and
hence will develop a velocity, W, relative to the ﬂuid. In many practical ﬂows it
is necessary to determine the maximum value of W (denoted by WM) that could
develop under these circumstances. To do so, one must ﬁrst consider whether
the available time, ℓ/U, is large or small compared with the typical time, tR,
required for the particle to reach its terminal velocity as given by Equation
(5.81) or (5.90). If tR ≪ℓ/U then WM is given by Equation (5.82), (5.86), or
(5.91) for W∞and qualitative estimates for WM/U would be

when WR/ν ≪1 and WR/ν ≫1 respectively. We refer to this as the qua-

On the other hand, if tT ≫ℓ/U, WM can be estimated as
W∞ℓ/UtR so that WM/U is of the order of

for all WR/ν. This is termed the transient regime.
In practice, WR/ν will not be known in advance.
The most meaningful
quantities that can be evaluated prior to any analysis are a Reynolds number,
UR/ν, based on ﬂow velocity and particle size, a size parameter
X = R
ℓ|1 −mp

(5.99)
and the parameter
Y = | 1 −mp

(5.100)
The resulting regimes of relative motion are displayed graphically in Figure 5.8.
The transient regime in the upper right-hand sector of the graph is character-
ized by large relative motion, as suggested by Equation (5.98). The quasistatic
regimes for WR/ν ≫1 and WR/ν ≪1 are in the lower right- and left-hand sec-
tors respectively. The shaded boundaries between these regimes are, of course,
approximate and are functions of the parameter Y , which must have a value

in the range 0 < Y < 1. As one proceeds deeper into either of the quasistatic
regimes, the magnitude of the relative velocity, WM/U, becomes smaller and
smaller. Thus, homogeneous ﬂows (see Chapter 6) in which the relative motion
is neglected require that either X ≪Y 2 or X ≪Y/(UR/ν). Conversely, if
either of these conditions is violated, relative motion must be included in the
analysis.
5.12
DEFORMATION DUE TO
TRANSLATION
In the case of bubbles, drops, or deformable particles it has thus far been tacitly
assumed that their shape is known and constant. Since the ﬂuid stresses due
to translation may deform such a particle, we must now consider not only the
parameters governing the deformation but also the consequences in terms of the
translation velocity and the shape. We concentrate here on bubbles and drops
in which surface tension, S, acts as the force restraining deformation. However,
the reader will realize that there would exist a similar analysis for deformable
elastic particles. Furthermore, the discussion will be limited to the case of steady
translation, caused by gravity, g. Clearly the results could be extended to cover
translation due to ﬂuid acceleration by using an eﬀective value of g as indicated
in the last section.
The characteristic force maintaining the sphericity of the bubble or drop
is given by SR. Deformation will occur when the characteristic anisotropy in

the ﬂuid forces approaches SR; the magnitude of the anisotropic ﬂuid force
will be given by µW∞R for W∞R/ν ≪1 or by ρW 2
∞R2 for W∞R/ν ≫1.
Thus deﬁning a Weber number, We = 2ρW 2
∞R/S, deformation will occur when
We/Re approaches unity for Re ≪1 or when We approaches unity for Re ≫1.
But evaluation of these parameters requires knowledge of the terminal velocity,
W∞, and this may also be a function of the shape. Thus one must start by
expanding the functional relation of Equation (5.95) which determines W∞to
include the Weber number:
F (Re, We, F r) = 0
(5.101)
This relation determines W∞where F r is given by Equations (5.93). Since all
three dimensionless coeﬃcients in this functional relation include both W∞and
R, it is simpler to rearrange the arguments by deﬁning another nondimensional
parameter known as the Haberman-Morton number, Hm, which is a combi-
nation of We, Re, and F r but does not involve W∞. The Haberman-Morton
number is deﬁned as
Hm =

(5.102)
In the case of a bubble, mp ≪ρτ and therefore the factor in parenthesis is
usually omitted. Then Hm becomes independent of the bubble size. It follows
that the terminal velocity of a bubble or drop can be represented by functional
relation
F (Re, Hm, F r) = 0
or
F ∗(Re, Hm, CD) = 0
(5.103)
and we shall conﬁne the following discussion to the nature of this relation for
bubbles (mp ≪ρτ).
Some values for the Haberman-Morton number (with mp/ρτ = 0) for various
saturated liquids are shown in Figure 5.9; other values are listed in Table 5.2.
Note that for all but the most viscous liquids, Hm is much less than unity. It
is, of course, possible to have ﬂuid accelerations much larger than g; however,
this is unlikely to cause Hm values greater than unity in practical multiphase
ﬂows of most liquids.
Having introduced the Haberman-Morton number, we can now identify the
conditions for departure from sphericity. For low Reynolds numbers (Re ≪1)
the terminal velocity will be given by Re ∝F r2. Then the shape will deviate

port, Bradshaw, and Richardson 1967).

Thus if Hm < 1 all bubbles for which Re ≪1 will remain spherical. However,
there are some unusual circumstances in which Hm > 1 and then there will be
a range of Re, namely Hm−1
2 < Re < 1, in which signiﬁcant departure from
sphericity might occur.
For high Reynolds numbers (Re ≫1) the terminal velocity is given by
F r ≈O(1) and distortion will occur if We > 1. Using F r = 1 and Hm =
We3F r−2Re−4 it follows that departure from sphericity will occur when
Re ≫Hm−1

(5.105)
Consequently, in the common circumstances in which Hm < 1, there exists a
range of Reynolds numbers, Re < Hm−1

nonspherical shapes occur when Re > Hm−1
4 . For Hm > 1 departure from
sphericity has already occurred at Re < 1 as discussed above.
Experimentally, it is observed that the initial departure from sphericity
causes ellipsoidal bubbles that may oscillate in shape and have oscillatory tra-
jectories (Hartunian and Sears 1957). As the bubble size is further increased
to the point at which We ≈20, the bubble acquires a new asymptotic shape,
known as a “spherical-cap bubble.” A photograph of a typical spherical-cap
bubble is shown in Figure 5.10; the notation used to describe the approximate
geometry of these bubbles is sketched in ﬁgure 5.11. Spherical-cap bubbles were
ﬁrst investigated by Davies and Taylor (1950), who observed that the terminal
velocity is simply related to the radius of curvature of the cap, RC, or to the

bubbles. Figure 5.12 is taken from from their review and shows that the value of

2 reaches a value of about 1 at a Reynolds number, Re = 2W∞RB/ν,
of about 200 and, thereafter, remains fairly constant. Visualization of the ﬂow
reveals that, for Reynolds numbers less than about 360, the wake behind the
bubble is laminar and takes the form of a toroidal vortex (similar to a Hill (1894)
spherical vortex) shown in the left-hand photograph of Figure 5.13. The wake
undergoes transition to turbulence about Re = 360, and bubbles at higher Re
have turbulent wakes as illustrated in the right side of Figure 5.13. We should
add that scuba divers have long observed that spherical-cap bubbles rising in the
ocean seem to have a maximum size of the order of 30 cm in diameter. When
they grow larger than this, they ﬁssion into two (or more) bubbles. However,
the author has found no quantitative study of this ﬁssion process.

In closing, we note that the terminal velocities of the bubbles discussed here
may be represented according to the functional relation of Equations (5.103) as
a family of CD(Re) curves for various Hm. Figure 5.14 has been extracted from
the experimental data of Haberman and Morton (1953) and shows the depen-
dence of CD(Re) on Hm at intermediate Re. The curves cover the spectrum
from the low Re spherical bubbles to the high Re spherical cap bubbles. The
data demonstrate that, at higher values of Hm, the drag coeﬃcient makes a rel-
atively smooth transition from the low Reynolds number result to the spherical
cap value of about 2.7. Lower values of Hm result in a deep minimum in the
drag coeﬃcient around a Reynolds number of about 200.

HOMOGENEOUS
BUBBLY FLOWS
6.1
INTRODUCTION
When the concentration of bubbles in a ﬂow exceeds some small value the bub-
bles will begin to have a substantial eﬀect on the ﬂuid dynamics of the suspend-
ing liquid. Analyses of the dynamics of this multiphase mixture then become
signiﬁcantly more complicated and important new phenomena may be manifest.
In this chapter we discuss some of the analyses and phenomena that may occur
in bubbly multiphase ﬂow.
In the larger context of practical multiphase (or multicomponent) ﬂows one
ﬁnds a wide range of homogeneities, from those consisting of one phase (or
component) that is very ﬁnely dispersed within the other phase (or component)
to those that consist of two separate streams of the two phases (or components).
In between are topologies that are less readily deﬁned.
The two asymptotic
states are conveniently referred to as homogeneous and separated ﬂow. One of
the consequences of the topology is the extent to which relative motion between
the phases can occur. It is clear that two diﬀerent streams can readily travel
at diﬀerent velocities, and indeed such relative motion is an implicit part of
the study of separated ﬂows. On the other hand, it is clear from the results
of Section 5.11 that any two phases could, in theory, be suﬃciently well mixed
and the disperse particle size suﬃciently small so as to eliminate any signiﬁcant
relative motion. Thus the asymptotic limit of truly homogeneous ﬂow precludes
relative motion. Indeed, the term homogeneous ﬂow is sometimes used to denote
a ﬂow with negligible relative motion. Many bubbly ﬂows come close to this
limit and can, to a ﬁrst approximation, be considered to be homogeneous. In
the present chapter we shall consider some of the properties of homogeneous
bubbly ﬂows.
In the absence of relative motion the governing mass and momentum con-
servation equations reduce to a form similar to those for single-phase ﬂow. The
175

eﬀective mixture density, ρ, is deﬁned by
ρ =

N
αNρN
(6.1)
where αN is the volume fraction of each of the N components or phases whose
individual densities are ρN. Then the continuity and momentum equations for
the homogeneous mixture are

(6.3)
in the absence of viscous eﬀects.
As in single-phase ﬂows the existence of a
barotropic relation, p = f(ρ), would complete the system of equations. In some
multiphase ﬂows it is possible to establish such a barotropic relation, and this
allows one to anticipate (with, perhaps, some minor modiﬁcation) that the entire
spectrum of phenomena observed in single-phase gas dynamics can be expected
in such a two-phase ﬂow. In this chapter we shall not dwell on this established
body of literature. Rather, we shall conﬁne attention to the identiﬁcation of a
barotropic relation (if any) and focus on some ﬂows in which there are major
departures from the conventional gas dynamic behavior.
From a thermodynamic point of view the existence of a barotropic relation,
p = f(ρ), and its associated sonic speed,
c =
dp
dρ
 1

(6.4)
implies that some thermodynamic property is considered to be held constant. In
single-phase gas dynamics this quantity is usually the entropy and occasionally
the temperature. In multiphase ﬂows the alternatives are neither simple nor
obvious. In single-phase gas dynamics it is commonly assumed that the gas is
in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times. In multiphase ﬂows it is usually the
case that the two phases are not in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other.
These are some of the questions one must address in considering an appropriate
homogeneous ﬂow model for a multiphase ﬂow. We begin in the next section
by considering the sonic speed of a two-phase or two-component mixture.
6.2
SONIC SPEED
Consider an inﬁnitesmal volume of a mixture consisting of a disperse phase
denoted by the subscript A and a continuous phase denoted by the subscript
B. For convenience assume the initial volume to be unity. Denote the initial
densities by ρA and ρB and the initial pressure in the continuous phase by pB.
Surface tension, S, can be included by denoting the radius of the disperse phase
particles by R. Then the initial pressure in the disperse phase is pA = pB+2S/R.

Now consider that the pressure, pA, is changed to pA + δpA where the dif-
ference δpA is inﬁnitesmal. Any dynamics associated with the resulting ﬂuid
motions will be ignored for the moment. It is assumed that a new equilibrium
state is achieved and that, in the process, a mass, δm, is transferred from the
continuous to the disperse phase.
It follows that the new disperse and con-
tinuous phase masses are ρAαA + δm and ρBαB −δm respectively where, of
course, αB = 1 −αA. Hence the new disperse and continuous phase volumes
are respectively

where the thermodynamic constraints QA and QB are, as yet, unspeciﬁed.
Adding these together and subtracting unity, one obtains the change in total

no disperse particles are created or destroyed, then the ratio δpA/δpB may be
determined by evaluating the new disperse particle size R + δR commensurate
with the new disperse phase volume and using the relation δpA = δpB −2S

This is incomplete in several respects. First, appropriate thermodynamic con-
straints QA and QB must be identiﬁed. Second, some additional constraint
is necessary to establish the relation δm/δpB. But before entering into a dis-
cussion of appropriate practical choices for these constraints (see Section 6.3)
several simpler versions of Equation (6.11) should be discussed.

We ﬁrst observe that in the absence of any exchange of mass between the
components the result reduces to

(6.13)
In other words, the acoustic impedance 1/ρc2 for the mixture is simply given by
the average of the acoustic impedance of the components weighted according to
their volume fractions.
Perhaps the most dramatic eﬀects occur when one of the components is a
gas (subscript G), which is much more compressible than the other component
(a liquid or solid, subscript L). In the absence of surface tension (p = pG = pL),
according to Equation (6.13), it matters not whether the gas is the continuous
or the disperse phase. Denoting αG by α for convenience and assuming the gas
is perfect and behaves polytropically according to ρk
G ∝p, Equation (6.13) may
be written as
1
c2 = [ρL(1 −α) + ρGα]
 α
kp + (1 −α)
ρLc2
L

(6.14)
This is the familiar form for the sonic speed in a two-component gas/liquid or
gas/solid ﬂow. In many applications p/ρLc2
L ≪1 and hence this expression may
be further simpliﬁed to
1
c2 = α
kp [ρL(1 −α) + ρGα]
(6.15)
Note however, that this approximation will not hold for small values of the gas
volume fraction α.
Equation (6.14) and its special properties were ﬁrst identiﬁed by Minnaert
(1933). It clearly exhibits one of the most remarkable features of the sonic ve-
locity of gas/liquid or gas/solid mixtures. The sonic velocity of the mixture can
be very much smaller than that of either of its constituents. This is illustrated
in Figure 6.1 where the speed of sound, c, in an air/water bubbly mixture is
plotted against the air volume fraction, α. Results are shown for both isother-
mal (k = 1) and adiabatic (k = 1.4) bubble behavior using Equation (6.14) or
(6.15), the curves for these two equations being indistinguishable on the scale
of the ﬁgure. Note that sonic velocities as low as 20 m/s occur.
Also shown in Figure 6.1 is experimental data of Karplus (1958) and Gouse
and Brown (1964). We shall see later (Section 6.8) that the dynamics of the
bubble volume change cause the sound speed to be a function of the frequency.
Data for sound frequencies of 1.0 kHz and 0.5 kHz are shown, as well as data

pressure for k = 1.0 and 1.4. Experimental data presented is from Karplus

and extrapolated to zero frequency(△).
extrapolated to zero frequency. The last should be compared with the analytical
results presented here since the analysis of this section neglects bubble dynamic
eﬀects. Note that the data corresponds to the isothermal theory, indicating that
the heat transfer between the bubbles and the liquid is suﬃcient to maintain
the air in the bubbles at roughly constant temperature.
Further discussion of the acoustic characteristics of dilute bubbly mixtures
is delayed until Section 6.8.
6.3
SONIC SPEED WITH CHANGE
OF PHASE
Turning now to the behavior of a two-phase rather than two-component mix-
ture, it is necessary not only to consider the additional thermodynamic con-
straint required to establish the mass exchange, δm, but also to reconsider the
two thermodynamic constraints, QA and QB, which were implicit in the two-
component analysis. These latter constraints were implicit in the choice of the
polytropic index, k, for the gas and the choice of the sonic speed, cL, for the
liquid. Note that a nonisentropic choice for k (for example, k = 1) implies that
heat is exchanged between the components, and yet this heat transfer process

was not explicitly considered, nor was an overall thermodynamic contraint such
as might be placed on the global change in entropy.
We shall see that the two-phase case requires more intimate knowledge of
these factors because the results are more sensitive to the thermodynamic con-
straints. In an ideal, inﬁnitely homogenized mixture of vapor and liquid the
phases would everywhere be in such close proximity to each other that heat
transfer between the phases would occur instantaneously. The entire mixture of
vapor and liquid would then always be in thermodynamic equilibrium. Indeed,
one model of the response of the mixture, called the homogeneous equilibrium
model, assumes this to be the case. In practice, however, one seeks results for
bubbly ﬂows and mist ﬂows in which heat transfer between the phases does not
occur so readily. A second common model assumes zero heat transfer between
the phases and is known as the homogeneous frozen model. In many circum-
stances the actual response lies somewhere between these extremes. A limited
amount of heat transfer occurs between those portions of each phase that are
close to the interface. In order to incorporate this in the analysis, we adopt an
approach that includes the homogeneous equilibrium and homogeneous frozen
responses as special cases but that requires a minor adjustment to the analysis
of the last section in order to reﬂect the degree of thermal exchange between
the phases. As in the last section the total mass of the phases A and B after
application of the incremental pressure, δp, are ρAαA + δm and ρBαB −δm,
respectively. We now deﬁne the fractions of each phase, ϵA and ϵB which, be-
cause of their proximity to the interface, exchange heat and therefore approach
thermodynamic equilibrium with each other. The other fractions (1 −ϵA) and
(1 −ϵB) are assumed to be eﬀectively insulated so that they behave isentropi-
cally. This is, of course, a crude simpliﬁcation of the actual circumstances, but
it permits qualitative assessment of practical ﬂows.
It follows that the volumes of the four fractions following the incremental
change in pressure, δp, are
(1 −ϵA)(ρAαA + δm)
[ρA + δp(∂ρA/∂p)S]
;
ϵA(ρAαA + δm)
[ρA + δp(∂ρA/∂p)E]
(1 −ϵB)(ρBαB −δm)
[ρB + δp(∂ρB/∂p)S]
;
ϵB(ρBαB −δm)
[ρB + δp(∂ρB/∂p)E]
(6.16)
where the subscripts S and E refer to isentropic and phase equilibrium deriva-
tives, respectively.
Then the change in total volume leads to the following
modiﬁed form for Equation (6.11) in the absence of surface tension:

The exchange of mass, δm, is now determined by imposing the constraint
that the entropy of the whole be unchanged by the perturbation. The entropy

prior to δp is
ρAαAsA + ρBαBsB
(6.18)
where sA and sB are the speciﬁc entropies of the two phases. Following the
application of δp, the entropy is

Note that if the communicating fractions ϵA and ϵB were both zero, this would
imply no exchange of mass. Thus ϵA = ϵB = 0 corresponds to the homoge-
neous frozen model (in which δm = 0) whereas ϵA = ϵB = 1 clearly yields the
homogeneous equilibrium model.
Substituting Equation (6.20) into Equation (6.17) and rearranging the result,
one can write

ρc2 = αA
p [(1 −ϵA)fA + ϵAgA] + αB
p [(1 −ϵB)fB + ϵBgB]

where L = hV −hL is the latent heat. It is normally adequate to approximate
fV and fL by the reciprocal of the ratio of speciﬁc heats for the gas and zero
respectively.
Thus fV is of order unity and fL is very small.
Furthermore
gL and gV can readily be calculated for any ﬂuid as functions of pressure or
temperature. Some particular values are shown in Figure 6.2. Note that gV is
close to unity for most ﬂuids except in the neighborhood of the critical point.
On the other hand, gL can be a large number that varies considerably with
pressure. To a ﬁrst approximation, gL is given by g∗(pC/p)η where pC is the
critical pressure and, as indicated in ﬁgure 6.2, g∗and η are respectively 1.67
and 0.73 for water. Thus, in summary, fL ≈0, fV and gV are of order unity,
and gL varies signiﬁcantly with pressure and may be large.
With these magnitudes in mind, we now examine the sensitivity of 1/ρc2 to

(6.25)
where kV = (1 −ϵV )fV + ϵV gV and kL = ϵLg∗(pC)η. Note ﬁrst that the result
is rather insensitive to ϵV since fV and gV are both of order unity. On the
other hand 1/ρc2 is sensitive to the interacting liquid fraction ϵL though this
sensitivity disappears as α approaches 1, in other words for mist ﬂow. Thus
the choice of ϵL is most important at low vapor volume fractions (for bubbly
ﬂows). In such cases, one possible qualitative estimate is that the interacting
liquid fraction, ϵL, should be of the same order as the gas volume fraction, α.
In Section 6.6 we will examine the eﬀect of the choice of ϵL and ϵV on a typical
vapor/liquid ﬂow and compare the model with experimental measurements.
6.4
BAROTROPIC RELATIONS
Conceptually, the expressions for the sonic velocity, Equations (6.13), (6.14),
(6.15), or (6.24), need only be integrated (after substituting c2 = dp/dρ) in
order to obtain the barotropic relation, p(ρ), for the mixture. In practice this
is algebraically complicated except for some of the simpler forms for c2.
Consider ﬁrst the case of the two-component mixture in the absence of mass
exchange or surface tension as given by Equation (6.14). It will initially be
assumed that the gas volume fraction is not too small so that Equation (6.15)
can be used; we will return later to the case of small gas volume fraction. It is
also assumed that the liquid or solid density, ρL, is constant and that p ∝ρk
G.
Furthermore it is convenient, as in gas dynamics, to choose reservoir conditions,
p = po, α = αo, ρG = ρGo to establish the integration constants. Then it follows
from the integration of Equation (6.15) that
ρ = ρo(1 −α)

and that

where ρo = ρL(1 −αo) + ρGoαo. It also follows that, written in terms of α,
c2 = kpo

As will be discussed later, Tangren, Dodge, and Seifert (1949) ﬁrst made use
of a more limited form of the barotropic relation of Equation (6.27) to evaluate
the one-dimensional ﬂow of gas/liquid mixtures in ducts and nozzles.

In the case of very small gas volume fractions, α, it may be necessary to
include the liquid compressibility term, 1 −α/ρLc2
L, in Equation (6.14). Exact
integration then becomes very complicated. However, it is suﬃciently accurate
at small gas volume fractions to approximate the mixture density ρ by ρL(1−α),
and then integration (assuming ρLc2
L = constant) yields

Implicit within Equation (6.29) is the barotropic relation, p(α), analogous to
Equation (6.27). Note that Equation (6.29) reduces to Equation (6.27) when
po/ρLc2
L is set equal to zero. Indeed, it is clear from Equation (6.29) that the
liquid compressibility has a negligible eﬀect only if αo ≫po/ρLc2
L. This pa-
rameter, po/ρLc2
L, is usually quite small. For example, for saturated water at
5 × 107 kg/msec2 (500 psi) the value of po/ρLc2
L is approximately 0.03. Nev-
ertheless, there are many practical problems in which one is concerned with
the discharge of a predominantly liquid medium from high pressure contain-
ers, and under these circumstances it can be important to include the liquid
compressibility eﬀects.
Now turning attention to a two-phase rather than two-component homoge-
neous mixture, the particular form of the sonic velocity given in Equation (6.25)
may be integrated to yield the implicit barotropic relation

because the approximation ρ ≈ρL(1 −α) is not suﬃciently accurate.

Dodge, and Seifert (1949); more general results for any polytropic index are
given in this section.

Given the reservoir conditions po and αo as well as the polytropic index k and
the liquid density (assumed constant), this relates the velocity, u, at any position
in the duct to the gas volume fraction, α, at that location. The pressure, p,
density, ρ, and volume fraction, α, are related by Equations (6.26) and (6.27).
The continuity equation,
A = Constant/ρu = Constant/u(1 −α)
(6.37)
completes the system of equations by permitting identiﬁcation of the location
where p, ρ, u, and α occur from knowledge of the cross-sectional area, A.
As in gas dynamics the conditions at a throat play a particular role in de-
termining both the overall ﬂow and the mass ﬂow rate. This results from the
observation that Equations (6.33) and (6.31) may be combined to obtain

is true when the ﬂow is choked. Denoting choked conditions at a throat by the
subscript ∗, it follows by equating the right-hand sides of Equations (6.28) and
(6.36) that the gas volume fraction at the throat, α∗, must be given when k ̸= 1

Thus the throat gas volume fraction, α∗, under choked ﬂow conditions is a

Solutions of Equations (6.39) and (6.40) for two typical cases, k = 1.4 and
k = 1.0, are shown in Figure 6.3. The corresponding ratio of the choked throat
pressure, p∗, to the reservior pressure, po, follows immediately from Equation
(6.27) given α = α∗and is also shown in Figure 6.3. Finally, the choked mass

This dimensionless choked mass ﬂow rate is exhibited in Figure 6.4 for k = 1.4
and k = 1.
Data from the experiments of Symington (1978) and Muir and Eichhorn
(1963) are included in Figures 6.3 and 6.4. Symington’s data on the critical
pressure ratio (Figure 6.3) is in good agreement with the isothermal (k = 1)
analysis indicating that, at least in his experiments, the heat transfer between
the bubbles and the liquid is large enough to maintain constant gas temperature
in the bubbles.
On the other hand, the experiments of Muir and Eichhorn
yielded larger critical pressure ratios and ﬂow rates than the isothermal theory.
However, Muir and Eichhorn measured signiﬁcant slip between the bubbles and

the liquid (strictly speaking the abscissa for their data in Figures 6.3 and 6.4
should be the upstream volumetric quality rather than the void fraction), and
the discrepancy could be due to the errors introduced into the present analysis
by the neglect of possible relative motion (see also van Wijngaarden 1972).
Finally, the pressure, volume fraction, and velocity elsewhere in the duct or
nozzle can be related to the throat conditions and the ratio of the area, A, to
the throat area, A∗. These relations, which are presented in Figures 6.5, 6.6,
and 6.7 for the case k = 1 and various reservoir volume fractions, αo, are most
readily obtained in the following manner. Given αo and k, p∗/po and α∗follow
from Figure 6.3. Then for p/po or p/p∗, α and u follow from Equations (6.27)
and (6.36) and the corresponding A/A∗follows by using Equation (6.37). The
resulting charts, Figures 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7, can then be used in the same way as
the corresponding graphs in gas dynamics.
If the gas volume fraction, αo, is suﬃciently small so that it is compara-
ble with po/ρLc2
L, then the barotropic Equation (6.29) should be used instead
of Equation (6.27). In cases like this in which it is suﬃcient to assume that
ρ ≈ρL(1 −α), integration of the momentum Equation (6.34) is most readily

The throat pressure, p∗(or rather p∗/po), is then obtained by equating the

The resulting relation, though algebraically

VAPOR/LIQUID NOZZLE FLOW
A barotropic relation, Equation (6.31), was constructed in Section 6.4 for the
case of two-phase ﬂow and, in particular, for vapor/liquid ﬂow. This may be used
to synthesize nozzle ﬂows in a manner similar to the two-component analysis of
the last section. Since the approximation ρ ≈ρL(1 −α) was used in deriving
both Equation (6.31) and Equation (6.42), we may eliminate α/(1 −α) from
these equations to obtain the velocity, u, in terms of p/po:

Though algebraically complicated, the equation that results when the right-

numerically to obtain the critical pressure ratio, p∗/po, for a given ﬂuid and
given values of αo, the reservoir pressure and the interacting ﬂuid fractions ϵL
and ϵV (see Section 6.3). Having obtained the critical pressure ratio, the critical
vapor volume fraction, α∗, follows from Equation (6.31) and the throat velocity,
c∗, from Equation (6.46). Then the dimensionless choked mass ﬂow rate follows
from the same relation as given in Equation (6.44).

acting ﬂuid fractions were chosen with the comment at the end of Section 6.3
in mind. Since ϵL is most important at low vapor volume fractions (i.e., for
bubbly ﬂows), it is reasonable to estimate that the interacting volume of liquid
surrounding each bubble will be of the same order as the bubble volume. Hence
ϵL = αo or αo/2 are appropriate choices. Similarly, ϵV is most important at high
vapor volume fractions (i.e., droplet ﬂows), and it is reasonable to estimate that
the interacting volume of vapor surrounding each droplet would be of the same
order as the droplet volume; hence ϵV = (1 −αo) or (1 −αo)/2 are appropriate
choices.
Figures 6.8 and 6.9 also include data obtained for water by Maneely (1962)
and Neusen (1962) for various reservoir pressures and volume fractions. Note
that the measured choked mass ﬂow rates are bracketed by the homogeneous
frozen and equilibrium curves and that the appropriately chosen partially frozen
analysis is in close agreement with the experiments, despite the neglect (in the
present model) of possible slip between the phases. The critical pressure ratio
data is also in good agreement with the partially frozen analysis except for some
discrepancy at the higher reservoir volume fractions.
It should be noted that the analytical approach described above is much sim-
pler to implement than the numerical solution of the basic equations suggested
by Henry and Fauske (1971). The latter does, however, have the advantage that
slip between the phases was incorporated into the model.
Finally, information on the pressure, volume fraction, and velocity elsewhere
in the duct (p/p∗, u/u∗, and α/α∗) as a function of the area ratio A/A∗follows
from a procedure similar to that used for the noncondensable case in Section
6.5. Typical results for water with a reservoir pressure, po, of 500 psia and using
the partially frozen analysis with ϵV = αo/2 and ϵL = (1 −αo)/2 are presented
in Figures 6.10, 6.11, and 6.12. In comparing these results with those for the
two-component mixture (Figures 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7) we observe that the pressure
ratios are substantially smaller and do not vary monotonically with αo. The
volume fraction changes are smaller, while the velocity gradients are larger.
6.7
FLOWS WITH BUBBLE DYNAMICS
Up to this point the analyses have been predicated on the existence of an eﬀective
barotropic relation for the homogeneous mixture. Indeed, the construction of
the sonic speed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 assumes that all the phases are in dynamic
equilibrium at all times. For example, in the case of bubbles in liquids, it is
assumed that the response of the bubbles to the change in pressure, δp, is an
essentially instantaneous change in their volume. In practice this would only be
the case if the typical frequencies experienced by the bubbles in the ﬂow are very

much smaller than the natural frequencies of the bubbles themselves (see Section
4.2). Under these circumstances the bubbles would behave quasistatically and
the mixture would be barotropic.
In this section we shall examine some ﬂows in which this criterion is not met.
Then the dynamics of individual bubbles as manifest by the Rayleigh-Plesset
Equation (2.12) should be incorporated into the solutions of the problem. The
mixture will no longer behave barotropically.
Viewing it from another perspective, we note that analyses of cavitating ﬂows
often consist of using a single-phase liquid pressure distribution as input to the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The result is the history of the size of individual
cavitating bubbles as they progress along a streamline in the otherwise purely
liquid ﬂow. Such an approach entirely neglects the interactive eﬀects that the
cavitating bubbles have on themselves and on the pressure and velocity of the
liquid ﬂow. The analysis that follows incorporates these interactions using the
equations for nonbarotropic homogeneous ﬂow.
It is assumed that the ratio of liquid to vapor density is suﬃciently large
so that the volume of liquid evaporated or condensed is negligible. It is also
assumed that bubbles are neither created or destroyed. Then the appropriate
continuity equation is
∂ui
∂xi
=
η
(1 + ητ)
Dτ
Dt
(6.47)
where η is the population or number of bubbles per unit volume of liquid and
τ(xi, t) is the volume of individual bubbles. The above form of the continuity
equation assumes that η is uniform; such would be the case if the ﬂow originated
from a uniform stream of uniform population and if there were no relative motion
between the bubbles and the liquid. Note also that α = ητ/(1 + ητ) and the
mixture density, ρ ≈ρL(1 −α) = ρL/(1 + ητ). This last relation can be used
to write the momentum Equation (6.3) in terms of τ rather than ρ:
ρL
Dui
Dt = −(1 + ητ) ∂p

(6.48)
The hydrostatic pressure gradient due to gravity has been omitted for simplicity.
Finally the Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (2.12) relates the pressure p and the
bubble volume, τ = 4

where pB, the pressure within the bubble, will be represented by the sum of a
partial pressure, pV , of the vapor plus a partial pressure of noncondensable gas
as given in Equation (2.11).
Equations (6.47), (6.48), and (6.49) can, in theory, be solved to ﬁnd the
unknowns p(xi, t), ui(xi, t), and τ(xi, t) (or R(xi, t)) for any bubbly cavitating
ﬂow. In practice the nonlinearities in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and in the
Lagrangian derivative, D/Dt = ∂/∂t + ui∂/∂xi, present serious diﬃculties for

all ﬂows except those of the simplest geometry. In the following sections several
such ﬂows are examined in order to illustrate the interactive eﬀects of bubbles in
cavitating ﬂows and the role played by bubble dynamics in homogeneous ﬂows.
6.8
ACOUSTICS OF BUBBLY MIXTURES
One class of phenomena in which bubble dynamics can play an important role is
the acoustics of dilute bubbly mixtures. When the acoustic excitation frequency
approaches the natural frequency of the bubbles, the latter no longer respond in
the quasistatic manner assumed in Section 6.2, and both the propagation speed
and the acoustic attenuation are signiﬁcantly altered. An excellent review of
this subject is given by van Wijngaarden (1972) and we will include here only a
summary of the key results. This class of problems has the advantage that the
magnitude of the perturbations is small so that the equations of the preceding
section can be greatly simpliﬁed by linearization.
Hence the pressure, p, will be represented by the following sum:
p = ¯p + Re

˜pejωt
(6.50)
where ¯p is the mean pressure, ω is the frequency, and ˜p is the small amplitude
pressure perturbation. The response of a bubble will be similarly represented
by a perturbation, ϕ, to its mean radius, Ro, such that
R = Ro

1 + Re

ϕejωt
(6.51)
and the linearization will neglect all terms of order ϕ2 or higher.
The literature on the acoustics of dilute bubbly mixtures contains two com-
plementary analytical approaches. In important papers, Foldy (1945) and Carstensen
and Foldy (1947) applied the classical acoustical approach and treated the prob-
lem of multiple scattering by randomly distributed point scatterers representing
the bubbles. The medium is assumed to be very dilute (α ≪1). The multiple
scattering produces both coherent and incoherent contributions. The incoher-
ent part is beyond the scope of this text.
The coherent part, which can be
represented by Equation (6.50), was found to satsify a wave equation and yields
a dispersion relation for the wavenumber, k, of plane waves, which implies a
phase velocity, ck = ω/k, given by (see van Wijngaarden 1972)

(6.53)
ωN is the natural frequency of a bubble in an inﬁnite liquid (Section 4.2), and
δD is a dissipation coeﬃcient that will be discussed shortly. It follows from

Equation (6.52) that scattering from the bubbles makes the wave propagation
dispersive since ck is a function of the frequency, ω.
As described by van Wijngaarden (1972) an alternative approach is to lin-
earize the ﬂuid mechanical Equations (6.47), (6.48), and (6.49), neglecting any
terms of order ϕ2 or higher. In the case of plane wave propagation in the di-
rection x (velocity u) in a frame of reference relative to the mixture (so that
the mean velocity is zero), the convective terms in the Lagrangian derivatives,
D/Dt, are of order ϕ2 and the three governing equations become

Assuming for simplicity that the liquid is incompressible (ρL = constant) and
eliminating two of the three unknown functions from these relations, one obtains

˜p, or ˜u, the velocity perturbation):

where αo is the mean void fraction given by αo = ητo/(1 + ητo). This equation
governing the acoustic perturbations is given by van Wijngaarden, though we
have added the surface tension term. Since the mean state must be in equilib-
rium, the mean liquid pressure, ¯p, is related to pGo by
¯p = pV + pGo −2S

(6.58)

Note that at the low frequencies for which one would expect quasistatic bubble
behavior (ω ≪ωN) and in the absence of vapor (pV = 0) and surface tension,
this reduces to the sonic velocity given by Equation (6.15) when ρG α ≪ρL(1−

where δD = 4νL/ωNR2
o. For the incompressible liquid assumed here this is iden-
tical to Equation (6.52) obtained using the Foldy multiple scattering approach
(the diﬀerence in sign for the damping term results from using j(ωt−kx) rather
than j(kx −ωt) and is inconsequential).
In the above derivation, the only damping mechanism that was included was
that due to viscous eﬀects on the radial motion of the bubbles. As discussed
in Section 4.4, other damping mechanisms (thermal and acoustic radiation)
that may aﬀect radial bubble motion can be included in approximate form in
the above analysis by deﬁning an “eﬀective” damping, δD, or, equivalently, an
eﬀective liquid viscosity, µE = ωNR2
oδD/4.
The real and imaginary parts of k as deﬁned by Equation (6.61) lead re-
spectively to a sound speed and an attenuation that are both functions of the
frequency of the perturbations. A number of experimental investigations have
been carried out (primarily at very small α) to measure the sound speed and
attenuation in bubbly gas/liquid mixtures. This data is reviewed by van Wijn-
gaarden (1972) who concentrates on the more recent experiments of Fox, Cur-
ley, and Lawson (1955), Macpherson (1957), and Silberman (1957), in which
the bubble size distribution was more accurately measured and controlled. In
general, the comparison between the experimental and theoretical propagation
speeds is good, as illustrated by Figure 6.13. One of the primary experimen-
tal diﬃculties illustrated in both Figures 6.13 and 6.14 is that the results are
quite sensitive to the distribution of bubble sizes present in the mixture. This
is caused by the fact that the bubble natural frequency is quite sensitive to the
mean radius (see Section 4.2). Hence a distribution in the size of the bubbles
yields broadening of the peaks in the data of Figures 6.13 and 6.14.
Though the propagation speed is fairly well predicted by the theory, the same
cannot be said of the attenuation, and there remain a number of unanswered
questions in this regard. Using Equation (6.61) the theoretical estimate of the
damping coeﬃcient, δD, pertinent to the experiments of Fox, Curley, and Law-
son (1955) is 0.093. But a much greater value of δD = 0.5 had to be used in order
to produce an analytical line close to the experimental data on attenuation; it
is important to note that the empirical value, δD = 0.5, has been used for the
theoretical results in Figure 6.14. On the other hand, Macpherson (1957) found
good agreement between a measured attenuation corresponding to δD ≈0.08
and the estimated analytical value of 0.079 relevant to his experiments. Similar
good agreement was obtained for both the propagation and attenuation by Sil-
berman (1957). Consequently, there appear to be some unresolved issues insofar
as the attenuation is concerned. Among the eﬀects that were omitted in the

above analysis and that might contribute to the attenuation is the eﬀect of the
relative motion of the bubbles. However, Batchelor (1969) has concluded that
the viscous eﬀects of translational motion would make a negligible contribution
to the total damping.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that virtually all of the reported data
on attenuation is conﬁned to very small void fractions of the order of 0.0005 or
less. The reason for this is clear when one evaluates the imaginary part of k
from Equation (6.61). At these small void fractions the damping is proportional
to α. Consequently, at large void fraction of the order, say, of 0.05, the damping
is 100 times greater and therefore more diﬃcult to measure accurately.
6.9
SHOCK WAVES IN BUBBLY FLOWS
The propagation and structure of shock waves in bubbly cavitating ﬂows rep-
resent a rare circumstance in which fully nonlinear solutions of the governing
equations can be obtained. Shock wave analyses of this kind have been inves-
tigated by Campbell and Pitcher (1958), Crespo (1969), Noordzij (1973), and
Figure 6.13: Sonic speed for water with air bubbles of mean radius, Ro =
0.12mm, and a void fraction, α = 0.0002, plotted against frequency. The ex-
perimental data of Fox, Curley, and Larson (1955) is plotted along with the
theoretical curve for a mixture with identical Ro = 0.11 mm bubbles (dotted
line) and with the experimental distribution of sizes (solid line). These lines use
δ = 0.5.

Figure 6.14: Values for the attenuation of sound waves corresponding to the
sonic speed data of Figure 6.13.
The attenuation in dB/cm is given by
8.69 Im{k} where k is in cm−1.
Noordzij and van Wijngaarden (1974), among others, and for more detail the
reader should consult these works. Since this chapter is conﬁned to ﬂows with-
out signiﬁcant relative motion, this section will not cover some of the important
eﬀects of relative motion on the structural evolution of shocks in bubbly liquids.
For this the reader is referred to Noordzij and van Wijngaarden (1974).
Consider a normal shock wave in a coordinate system moving with the shock
so that the ﬂow is steady and the shock stationary.
If x and u represent a
coordinate and the ﬂuid velocity normal to the shock, then continuity requires
ρu = constant = ρ1u1
(6.62)
where ρ1 and u1 will refer to the mixture density and velocity far upstream
of the shock. Hence u1 is also the velocity of propagation of a shock into a
mixture with conditions identical to those upstream of the shock. It is assumed
that ρ1 ≈ρL(1 −α1) = ρL/(1 + ητ1) where the liquid density is considered
constant and α1, τ1 =
4
3πR3
1, and η are the void fraction, individual bubble
volume, and population of the mixture far upstream.
Substituting for ρ in the equation of motion and integrating, one also obtains
p + ρ2

ρ

(6.63)
This expression for the pressure, p, may be substituted into the Rayleigh-Plesset

equation using the observation that, for this steady ﬂow,

It will be found that dissipation eﬀects in the bubble dynamics (see Sections
4.3 and 4.4) strongly inﬂuence the structure of the shock. Only one dissipative
term, that term due to viscous eﬀects (last term on the left-hand side) has been
included in Equation (6.66). However, note that the other dissipative eﬀects
may be incorporated approximately (see Section 4.4) by regarding νL as a total
“eﬀective” damping viscosity.
The pressure within the bubble is given by
pB = pV + pG1
!τ1
$τ"k
(6.67)
and the equilibrium state far upstream must satisfy
pV −p1 + pG1 = 2S$R1
(6.68)
Furthermore, if there exists an equilibrium state far downstream of the shock
(this existence will be explored shortly), then it follows from Equations (6.66)
and (6.67) that the velocity, u1, must be related to the ratio, R2

2S/ρLR1 = 0.1 m2/sec2, and k = 1.4. Also shown by the dotted line is the
sonic velocity, c1, under the same upstream conditions.
Hence the “shock velocity,” u1, is given by the upstream ﬂow parameters
α1, (p1 −pV )/ρL, and 2S/ρLR1, the polytropic index, k, and the downstream
void fraction, α2. An example of the dependence of u1 on α1 and α2 is shown
in Figure 6.15 for selected values of (p1 −pV )/ρL = 100 m2/sec2, 2S/ρLR1 =
0.1 m2/sec2, and k = 1.4. Also displayed by the dotted line in this ﬁgure is the
sonic velocity of the mixture, c1, under the upstream conditions (actually the
sonic velocity at zero frequency); it is readily shown that c1 is given by

Alternatively, one may follow the presentation conventional in gas dynamics
and plot the upstream Mach number, u1/c1, as a function of α1 and α2. The
resulting graphs are functions only of two parameters, the polytropic index, k,
and the parameter, R1(p1 −pV )/S. An example is included as Figure 6.16 in
which k = 1.4 and R1(p1 −pV )/S = 200. It should be noted that a real shock
velocity and a real sonic speed can exist even when the upstream mixture is
under tension (p1 < pV ). However, the numerical value of the tension, pV −p1,
for which the values are real is limited to values of the parameter R1(p1 −
pV )/2S > −(1 −1/3k) or −0.762 for k = 1.4. Also note that Figure 6.16 does
not change much with the parameter, R1(p1 −pV )/S.

and downstream void fractions, α1 and α2, for k = 1.4 and R1(p1−pV )/S = 200.
Bubble dynamics do not aﬀect the results presented thus far since the speed,
u1, depends only on the equilibrium conditions upstream and downstream. How-
ever, the existence and structure of the shock depend on the bubble dynamic
terms in Equation (6.66). That equation is more conveniently written in terms
of a radius ratio, r = R/R1, and a dimensionless coordinate, z = x/R1:

It could also be written in terms of the void fraction, α, since
r3 =

(6.73)
When examined in conjunction with the expression in Equation (6.69) for u1,
it is clear that the solution, r(z) or α(z), for the structure of the shock is a
function only of α1, α2, k, R1(p1 −pV )/S, and the eﬀective Reynolds number,
u1R1/νL, which, as previously mentioned, should incorporate the various forms
of bubble damping.

Figure 6.17: The typical structure of a shock wave in a bubbly mixture is
illustrated by these examples for α1 = 0.3, k = 1.4, R1(p1 −pV )/S ≫1, and
u1R1/νL = 100.
Equation (6.72) can be readily integrated numerically using Runge-Kutta
procedures, and typical solutions are presented in Figure 6.17 for α1 = 0.3, k =
1.4, R1(p1−pV )/S ≫1, u1R1/νL = 100, and two downstream volume fractions,
α2 = 0.1 and 0.05. These examples illustrate several important features of the
structure of these shocks. First, the initial collapse is followed by many rebounds
and subsequent collapses. The decay of these nonlinear oscillations is determined
by the damping or u1R1/νL. Though u1R1/νL includes an eﬀective kinematic
viscosity to incorporate other contributions to the bubble damping, the value
of u1R1/νL chosen for this example is probably smaller than would be relevant
in many practical applications, in which we might expect the decay to be even
smaller. It is also valuable to identify the nature of the solution as the damping
is eliminated (u1R1/νL →∞).
In this limit the distance between collapses
increases without bound until the structure consists of one collapse followed by
a downstream asymptotic approach to a void fraction of α1 (not α2). In other
words, no solution in which α →α2 exists in the absence of damping.
Another important feature in the structure of these shocks is the typical
interval between the downstream oscillations. This “ringing” will, in practice,
result in acoustic radiation at frequencies corresponding to this interval, and
it is of importance to identify the relationship between this ring frequency and
the natural frequency of the bubbles downstream of the shock. A characteristic
ring frequency, ωR, for the shock oscillations can be deﬁned as
ωR = 2πu1
$∆x
(6.74)
where ∆x is the distance between the ﬁrst and second bubble collapses. The
natural frequency of the bubbles far downstream of the shock, ω2, is given by

Figure 6.18: The ratio of the ring frequency downstream of a bubbly mixture
shock to the natural frequency of the bubbles far downstream as a function of the
eﬀective damping parameter, νL/u1R1, for α1 = 0.3 and various downstream
void fractions as indicated.

and typical values for the ratio ωR/ω2 are presented in Figure 6.18 for α1 = 0.3,
k = 1.4, R1(p1 −pV )/S ≫1, and various values of α2. Similar results were
obtained for quite a wide range of values of α1. Therefore note that the frequency
ratio is primarily a function of the damping and that ring frequencies up to a
factor of 10 less than the natural frequency are to be expected with typical values
of the damping in water. This reduction in the typical frequency associated with
the collective behavior of bubbles presages the natural frequencies of bubble
clouds, which are discussed in the next section.
6.10
SPHERICAL BUBBLE CLOUD
A second illustrative example of the eﬀect of bubble dynamics on the behavior of
a homogeneous bubbly mixture is the study of the dynamics of a ﬁnite cloud of
bubbles. Clouds of bubbles occur in many circumstances. For example, breaking
waves generate clouds of bubbles as illustrated in Figure 6.19, and these aﬀect
the acoustic environment in the ocean.
One of the earliest investigations of the collective dynamics of bubble clouds
was the work of van Wijngaarden (1964) on the oscillations of a layer of bubbles

Figure 6.19: Photograph of a breaking wave showing the resulting cloud of
bubbles. The vertical distances between the crosses is about 5 cm. Reproduced
from Petroﬀ(1993) with the author’s permission.

near a wall. Later d’Agostino and Brennen (1983) investigated the dynamics of a
spherical cloud (see also d’Agostino and Brennen 1989, Omta 1987), and we will
choose the latter as a example of that class of problems with one space dimension
in which analytical solutions may be obtained but only after linearization of the
Rayleigh-Plesset Equation (6.49).
The geometry of the spherical cloud is shown in Figure 6.20. Within the
cloud of radius, A(t), the population of bubbles per unit liquid volume, η, is
assumed constant and uniform. The linearization assumes small perturbations
of the bubbles from an equilibrium radius, Ro:
R(r, t) = Ro [1 + ϕ(r, t)] , |ϕ| ≪1
(6.76)
We will seek the response of the cloud to a correspondingly small perturbation

in the pressure at inﬁnity, p∞(t), which is represented by
p∞(t) = p(∞, t) = ¯p + Re ˜pejωt
(6.77)
where ¯p is the mean, uniform pressure and ˜p and ω are the perturbation ampli-
tude and frequency, respectively. The solution will relate the pressure, p(r, t),
radial velocity, u(r, t), void fraction, α(r, t), and bubble perturbation, ϕ(r, t),
to ˜p. Since the analysis is linear, the response to excitation involving multiple
frequencies can be obtained by Fourier synthesis.
One further restriction is necessary in order to linearize the governing Equa-
tions (6.47), (6.48), and (6.49). It is assumed that the mean void fraction in the
cloud, αo, is small so that the term (1 + ητ) in Equations (6.47) and (6.48) is
approximately unity. Then these equations become

It is readily shown that the velocity u is of order ϕ and hence the convective
component of the material derivative is of order ϕ2; thus the linearization implies
replacing D/Dt by ∂/∂t. It then follows from the Rayleigh-Plesset equation that

inﬁnite ﬂuid (equation 4.8). It must be assumed that the bubbles are in stable
equilibrium in the mean state so that ωN is real.
Upon substitution of Equations (6.76) and (6.80) into (6.78) and (6.79) and
elimination of u(r, t) one obtains the following equation for ϕ(r, t) in the domain

The entire ﬂow has thus been determined in terms of the prescribed quantities

Note ﬁrst that the cloud has a number of natural frequencies and modes
of oscillation. From Equation (6.85) it follows that, if ˜p were zero, oscillations
would only occur if

and, therefore, using Equation (6.86) for λ, the natural frequencies, ωn, of the

liquid, and
2. ωn = ωN

the cloud are contained in a small range just below ωN.
Typical natural modes of oscillation of the cloud are depicted in Figure 6.21,
where normalized amplitudes of the bubble radius and pressure ﬂuctuations are
shown as functions of position, r/Ao, within the cloud. The amplitude of the
radial velocity oscillation is proportional to the slope of these curves. Since each
bubble is supposed to react to a uniform far ﬁeld pressure, the validity of the
model is limited to wave numbers, n, such that n ≪Ao/Ro. Note that the ﬁrst
mode involves almost uniform oscillations of the bubbles at all radial positions
within the cloud. Higher modes involve amplitudes of oscillation near the center
of the cloud, which become larger and larger relative to the amplitudes in the rest
of the cloud. In eﬀect, an outer shell of bubbles essentially shields the exterior
ﬂuid from the oscillations of the bubbles in the central core, with the result
that the pressure oscillations in the exterior ﬂuid are of smaller amplitude for
the higher modes. The corresponding shielding eﬀects during forced excitation
are illustrated in Figure 6.22, which shows the distribution of the amplitude of
bubble radius oscillation, |ϕ|, within the cloud at various excitation frequencies,
ω. Note that, while the entire cloud responds in a fairly uniform manner for
ω < ωN, only a surface layer of bubbles exhibits signiﬁcant response when
ω > ωN. In the latter case the entire core of the cloud is essentially shielded by
the outer layer.
The variations in the response at diﬀerent frequencies are shown in more

detail in Figure 6.23, in which the amplitude at the cloud surface, |ϕ(Ao, t)|, is
presented as a function of ω. The solid line corresponds to the above analysis,
which did not include any bubble damping. Consequently, there are asymptotes
to inﬁnity at each of the cloud natural frequencies; for clarity we have omitted
the numerous asymptotes that occur just below the bubble natural frequency,
ωN. Also shown in this ﬁgure are the corresponding results when a reasonable
estimate of the damping is included in the analysis (d’Agostino and Brennen
1989). The attenuation due to the damping is much greater at the higher fre-
quencies so that, when damping is included (Figure 6.23), the dominant feature
of the response is the lowest natural frequency of the cloud. The response at
the bubble natural frequency becomes much less signiﬁcant.
The eﬀect of varying the parameter, αo(1 −αo)A2
o/R2
o, is shown in Figure
6.24. Note that increasing the void fraction causes a reduction in both the am-
plitude and frequency of the dominant response at the lowest natural frequency
of the cloud. d’Agostino and Brennen (1988) have also calculated the acoustical
absorption and scattering cross-sections of the cloud that this analysis implies.
Not surprisingly, the dominant peaks in the cross-sections occur at the lowest
cloud natural frequency.
It is important to emphasize that the analysis presented above is purely
linear and that there are likely to be very signiﬁcant nonlinear eﬀects that may
have a major eﬀect on the dynamics and acoustics of real bubble clouds. Hanson
et al. (1981) and Mørch (1980, 1981) visualize that the collapse of a cloud of

bubbles involves the formation and inward propagation of a shock wave and that
the focusing of this shock at the center of the cloud creates the enhancement of
the noise and damage potential associated with cloud collapse (see Section 3.7).
The deformations of the individual bubbles within a collapsing cloud have been
examined numerically by Chahine and Duraiswami (1992), who showed that the
bubbles on the periphery of the cloud develop inwardly directed reentrant jets
(see Section 3.5).
Numerical investigations of the nonlinear dynamics of cavity clouds have
been carried out by Chahine (1982), Omta (1987), and Kumar and Brennen
(1991, 1992, 1993). Kumar and Brennen have obtained weakly nonlinear so-
lutions to a number of cloud problems by retaining only the terms that are
quadratic in the amplitude; this analysis is a natural extension of the weakly
nonlinear solutions for a single bubble described in Section 4.6. One interesting
phenomenon that emerges from this nonlinear analysis involves the interactions
between the bubbles of diﬀerent size that would commonly occur in any real
cloud. The phenomenon, called “harmonic cascading” (Kumar and Brennen
1992), occurs when a relatively small number of larger bubbles begins to re-
spond nonlinearly to some excitation. Then the higher harmonics produced will
excite the much larger number of smaller bubbles at their natural frequency.
The process can then be repeated to even smaller bubbles.
In essence, this
nonlinear eﬀect causes a cascading of ﬂuctuation energy to smaller bubbles and
higher frequencies.
In all of the above we have focused, explicitly or implicitly, on spherical bub-
ble clouds. Solutions of the basic equations for other, more complex geometries
are not readily obtained. However, d’Agostino et al. (1988) have examined
some of the characteristics of this class of ﬂows past slender bodies (for exam-
ple, the ﬂow over a wavy surface). Clearly, in the absence of bubble dynamics,
one would encounter two types of ﬂow: subsonic and supersonic. Interestingly,
the inclusion of bubble dynamics leads to three types of ﬂow. At suﬃciently
low speeds one obtains the usual elliptic equations of subsonic ﬂow. And when
the sonic speed is exceeded, the equations become hyberbolic and the ﬂow su-
personic.
However, with further increase in speed, the time rate of change
becomes equivalent to frequencies above the natural frequency of the bubbles.
Then the equations become elliptic again and a new ﬂow regime, termed “super-
resonant,” occurs. d’Agostino et al. (1988) explore the consequences of this and
other features of these slender body ﬂows.

CAVITATING FLOWS
7.1
INTRODUCTION
We begin this discussion of cavitation in ﬂows by describing the eﬀect of the
ﬂow on a single cavitation “event.” This is the term used in referring to the
processes that occur when a single cavitation nucleus is convected into a region
of low pressure within the ﬂow, grows explosively to macroscopic size, and col-
lapses when it is convected back into a region of higher pressure. Pioneering
observations of individual cavitation events were made by Knapp and his asso-
ciates at the California Institute of Technology in the 1940s (see, for example,
Knapp and Hollander 1948) using high-speed movie cameras capable of 20,000
frames per second. Shortly thereafter Plesset (1948), Parkin (1952), and others
began to model these observations of the growth and collapse of traveling cavi-
tation bubbles using modiﬁcations of Rayleigh’s original equation of motion for
a spherical bubble. Many analyses and experiments on traveling bubble cavita-
tion followed, and a brief description these is included in the next section. All
of the models are based on two assumptions: that the bubbles remain spherical
and that events do not interact with one another.
However, observations of real ﬂows demonstrate that even single cavitation
bubbles are often far from spherical.
Indeed, they may not even be single
bubbles but rather a cloud of smaller bubbles.
Departure from sphericity is
often the result of the interaction of the bubble with the pressure gradients and
shear forces in the ﬂow or the interaction with a solid surface. In Section 7.3 we
describe some of these eﬀects while still assuming that the events are suﬃciently
far apart in space and time that they do not interact with one another or
modify the global liquid ﬂow in any signiﬁcant way. Often the words “limited
cavitation” are used to distinguish these circumstances from the more complex
phenomena that occur at higher event densities.
When the frequency of cavitation events increases in space or time such
that they begin to interact with one another, a whole new set of phenomena
may be manifest. They may begin to interact hydrodynamically, and some of
217

the resulting phenomena are described and analysed in Chapter 6. Often these
interaction phenomena can have important practical consequences as is the case,
for example, with cloud cavitation (see section 3.7).
But increase in the density of events also causes the formation of large-scale
cavitation structures either because of the coalescence of individual bubbles (of-
ten because they accumulate in regions of recirculating ﬂow) or because a large
region of the ﬂow vaporizes. Typical large-scale structures include cavitating
vortices and attached cavities. As a result, cavitating ﬂows can exhibit a number
of diﬀerent kinds of cavitation; later in this chapter we shall describe some of
the forms that large-scale cavitation structures can take. Some of the analytical
methods used to understand and predict these structures are discussed in the
next chapter.
7.2
TRAVELING BUBBLE CAVITATION
Since the early work by Plesset (1948) had demonstrated some approximate
validity for models of cavitation events that use the equation we now refer to
as the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, Parkin (1952) was motivated to attempt a
more detailed model for the growth of traveling cavitation bubbles in the ﬂow
around a body. It was assumed that the bubbles began as micron-sized nuclei
in the liquid of the oncoming stream and that the bubble moved with the liquid
velocity along a streamline close to the solid surface. Cavitation inception was
deemed to occur when the bubbles reached an observable size of the order of
1 mm. Parkin believed the lack of agreement between this theory and the exper-
imental observations was due to the neglect of the boundary layer. Subsequent
experiments by Kermeen, McGraw, and Parkin (1955) revealed that cavitation
could result either from free stream nuclei as earlier assumed or from nuclei orig-
inating from imperfections in the headform surface, which would detach when
they reached a critical size. Later, Arakeri and Acosta (1973) observed that, if
separation occurs close to the low-pressure region, then free stream nuclei could
not only be supplied to the cavitating zone by the oncoming stream but could
also be supplied by the recirculating ﬂow downstream of separation. Under such
circumstances some of these recirculating nuclei could be remnants from a cav-
itation event itself, and hence there exists the possibility of hysteretic eﬀects.
Though the supply of nuclei either from the surface or from downstream may
occasionally be important, the majority of the experimental observations indi-
cate that the primary supply is from nuclei present in the incident free stream.
Other viscous boundary layer eﬀects on cavitation inception and on traveling
bubble cavitation are reviewed by Holl (1969) and Arakeri (1979).
Rayleigh-Plesset models of traveling bubble cavitation that attempted to
incorporate the eﬀects of the boundary layer include the work of Oshima (1961)
and Van der Walle (1962).
Holl and Kornhauser (1970) added the thermal
eﬀects on bubble growth and explored the inﬂuence of initial conditions such as
the size and location of the nucleus. Like Parkin’s (1952) original model these
improved versions continued to assume that the nucleus or bubble moves along

a streamline with the ﬂuid velocity. However, Johnson and Hsieh (1966) showed
that since the streamlines that encounter the low-pressure region are close to the
surface and, therefore, close to the stagnation streamline, nuclei will experience
large ﬂuid accelerations and pressure gradients as they pass close to the front
stagnation point. The eﬀect is to force the nuclei to move outwards away from
the stagnation streamline. Moreover, the larger nuclei, which are those most
likely to cavitate, will be displaced more than the smaller nuclei. Johnson and
Hsieh termed this the “screening” eﬀect, and more recent studies have conﬁrmed
its importance in cavitation inception. But this screening eﬀect is only one of
the eﬀects that the accelerations and pressure gradients in the ﬂow can have on
the nucleus and on the growing and collapsing cavitation bubble. In the next
section we turn to a description of these interactions.
7.3
BUBBLE/FLOW INTERACTIONS
The maximum-modulus theorem states that maxima of a harmonic function
must occur on the boundary and not in the interior of the region of solution
of that function (see, for example, Titchmarsh 1947). Consequently, a pressure
minimum in a steady, inviscid, potential ﬂow must occur on the boundary of
that ﬂow (see Kirchhoﬀ1869, Birkhoﬀand Zarantonello 1957). Moreover, real
ﬂuid eﬀects in many ﬂows do not alter the fact that the minimum pressure
occurs at or close to a solid surface.
Perhaps the most common exception
to this rule is in vortex cavitation, where the unsteady eﬀects and/or viscous
eﬀects associated with vortex shedding or turbulence cause deviation from the
maximum-modulus theorem; but discussion of this type of cavitation is delayed
until later. In the many ﬂows in which the minimum pressure does occur on
a boundary, it follows that the cavitation bubbles that form in the vicinity
of that point are likely to be aﬀected by and to interact with that boundary,
which we will assume is a solid surface.
We observe, furthermore, that any
curvature of the solid surface or, more speciﬁcally, of the streamlines in the
vicinity of the minimum pressure point will cause pressure gradients normal to
the surface, which are often substantially larger than those in the streamwise
direction.
These normal pressure gradients will force the bubble toward the
surface and may cause substantial departure from sphericity.
Consequently,
even before boundary layer eﬀects are factored into the picture, it is evident
that the dynamics of individual cavitation bubbles may be signiﬁcantly altered
by interactions with the nearby solid surface and the ﬂow near that surface. In
this section we focus attention on these bubble/wall or bubble/ﬂow interactions
(grouped together in the term bubble/ﬂow interactions).
Before describing some of the experimental observations of bubble/ﬂow in-
teractions, it is valuable to consider the relative sizes of the cavitation bubbles
and the viscous boundary layer. In the ﬂow of a uniform stream of velocity, U,
around an object such as a hydrofoil with typical dimension, ℓ, the thickness
of the laminar boundary layer near the minimum pressure point will be given
qualitatively by δ = (νLℓ/U)
1
2 .
Parenthetically, we note that transition to

turbulence usually occurs downstream of the point of minimum pressure, and
consequently the appropriate boundary layer thickness for limited cavitation
conﬁned to the immediate neighborhood of the low-pressure region is the lam-
inar boundary layer thickness. Moreover, the approximate analysis of Section
2.5 yields a typical maximum bubble radius, RM, given by
RM ≈2ℓ(−σ −Cpmin)
(7.1)
It follows that the ratio of the boundary layer thickness to the maximum bubble
radius, δ/RM, is roughly given by
δ
RM
=
1
2(−σ −Cpmin)
 νL
ℓU
 1
2
(7.2)
Therefore, provided (−σ−Cpmin) is of the order of 0.1 or greater, it follows that
for the high Reynolds numbers, Uℓ/νL, which are typical of most of the ﬂows
in which cavitation is a problem, the boundary layer is usually much thinner
than the typical dimension of the bubble. This does not mean the boundary
layer is unimportant. But we can anticipate that those parts of the cavitation
bubble farthest from the solid surface will interact with the primarily inviscid
ﬂow outside the boundary layer, while those parts close to the solid surface will
be aﬀected by the boundary layer.

EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS
Some of the early (and classic) observations of individual traveling cavitation
bubbles by Knapp and Hollander (1948), Parkin (1952), and Ellis (1952) make
mention of the deformation of the bubbles by the ﬂow. But the focus of attention
soon shifted to the easier observations of the dynamics of individual bubbles in
quiescent liquid, and it is only recently that investigations of the deformation
caused by the ﬂow have resumed. Both Knapp and Hollander (1948) and Parkin
(1952) observed that almost all cavitation bubbles are closer to hemispherical
than spherical and that they appear to be separated from the solid surface by
a thin ﬁlm of liquid. Such bubbles are clearly evident in other photographs of
traveling cavitation bubbles on a hydrofoil such as those of Blake et al. (1977)
or Brian¸con-Marjollet et al. (1990).
A number of recent research eﬀorts have focused on these bubble/ﬂow in-
teractions, including the work of van der Meulen and van Renesse (1989) and
Brian¸con-Marjollet et al. (1990). Recently, Ceccio and Brennen (1991) and
Kuhn de Chizelle et al. (1992a,b) have made an extended series of observations
of cavitation bubbles in the ﬂow around axisymmetric bodies, including studies
of the scaling of the phenomena. Two axisymmetric body shapes were used,
both of which have been employed in previous cavitation investigations. The
ﬁrst of these was a so-called “Schiebe body” (Schiebe 1972) which is one of a
series based on the solutions for the potential ﬂow generated by a normal source
disk (Weinstein 1948) and ﬁrst suggested for use in cavitation experiments by

Van Tuyl (1950). One of the important characteristics of this shape is that the
boundary layer does not separate in the region of low pressure within which
cavitation bubbles occur. The second body had the ITTC headform shape orig-
inally used by Lindgren and Johnsson (1966) for the comparative experiments
described in Section 1.15. This headform exhibits laminar separation within the
region in which the cavitation bubbles occur. For both headforms, the isobars
in the neighborhood of the minimum pressure point exhibit a large pressure gra-
dient normal to the surface, as illustrated by the isobars for the Schiebe body
shown in Figure 7.1. This pressure gradient is associated with the curvature
of the body and therefore the streamlines in the vicinity of the minimum pres-
sure point. Consequently, at a given cavitation number, σ, the region below
the vapor pressure that is enclosed between the solid surface and the Cp = −σ
isobaric surface is long and thin compared with the size of the headform. Only
nuclei that pass through this thin volume will cavitate.
The observations of Ceccio and Brennen (1991) at lower Reynolds numbers
will be described ﬁrst. Typical photographs of bubbles on the 5.08 cm diameter
Schiebe headform during the cycle of bubble growth and collapse are shown
in Figure 7.2. Simultaneous proﬁle and plan views provide a more complete
picture of the bubble geometry. In all cases the shape during the initial growth
phase was that of a spherical cap, the bubble being separated from the wall

by a thin layer of liquid of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer
thickness. Later developments depend on the geometry of the headform and the
Reynolds number, so we begin with the simplest case, that of the Schiebe body at
relatively low Reynolds number. Typical photographs for this case are included
in Figure 7.2. As the bubble begins to enter the region of adverse pressure
gradient, the exterior frontal surface begins to be pushed inward, causing the
proﬁle of the bubble to appear wedge-like. Thus the collapse is initiated on
the exterior frontal surface of the bubble, and this often leads to the bubble
ﬁssioning into forward and aft bubbles as seen in Figure 7.2.
Two other processes are occuring at the same time. First, the streamwise
thickness of the bubble decreases faster than its spanwise breadth (spanwise
being deﬁned as the direction parallel to the headform surface and normal to
the oncoming stream), so that the largest dimension of the bubble is its spanwise
breadth. Second, the bubble acquires signiﬁcant spanwise vorticity through its
interactions with the boundary layer during the growth phase. Consequently, as
the collapse proceeds, this vorticity is concentrated and the bubble evolves into
one (or two or possibly more) cavitating vortex with a spanwise axis. These
vortex bubbles proceed to collapse and seem to rebound as a cloud of much
smaller bubbles. Often a coherent second collapse of this cloud was observed
when the bubbles were not too scattered by the ﬂow. Ceccio and Brennen (1991)
(see also Kumar and Brennen 1993) conclude that the ﬂow-induced ﬁssion prior
to collapse can have a substantial eﬀect on the noise impulse (see Section 3.8).
Two additional phenomena were observed on the ITTC headform, which ex-
hibited laminar separation. The ﬁrst of these was the observation that the layer
of liquid underneath the bubble would become disrupted by some instability.
As seen in Figure 7.3, this results in a bubbly layer of ﬂuid that subsequently
gets left behind the main bubble. Thus the instability of the liquid layer leads
to another process of bubble ﬁssion. Because of the physical separation, the
bubbly layer would collapse after the main body of the bubble.
The second and perhaps more consequential phenomenon observed with the
ITTC headform only occurs with the occasional bubble.
Infrequently, when
a bubble passes the point of laminar separation, it triggers the formation of
local “attached cavitation” streaks at the lateral or spanwise extremities of the
bubble, as seen in Figure 7.4. Then, as the main bubble proceeds downstream,
these “streaks” or “tails” of attached cavitation are stretched out behind the
main bubble, the trailing ends of the tails being attached to the solid surface.
Subsequently, the main bubble collapses ﬁrst, leaving the “tails” to persist for
a fraction longer, as illustrated by the lower photograph in Figure 7.4.
The importance of these occasional “events with tails” did not become clear
until tests were conducted at much higher Reynolds numbers, with larger head-
forms (up to 50.5 cm in diameter) and somewhat higher speeds (up to 15 m/s).
These tests were part of an investigation of the scaling of the bubble dynamic
phenomena described above (Kuhn de Chizelle et al. 1992a,b). One notable
observation was the presence of a “dimple” on the exterior surface of all the
individual traveling bubbles; examples of this dimple are included in Figure
7.5. They are not the precursor to a reentrant jet, for the dimple seems to be

instability of the liquid layer under a traveling cavitation bubble. From Ceccio
and Brennen (1991) experiments with a 5.08 cm diameter ITTC headform at

relatively stable during most of the collapse process. More importantly, it was
observed that, at higher Reynolds number, “attached tails” occurred even on
these Schiebe bodies, which did not normally exhibit laminar separation. More-
over, the probability of occurence of attached tails increased as the Reynolds
number increased and the attached cavitation began to be more extensive. As
the Reynolds number increased further, the bubbles would tend to trigger at-
tached cavities over the entire wake of the bubble as seen in the lower two
photographs in Figure 7.5. Moreover, the attached cavitation would tend to re-
main for a longer period after the main bubble had disappeared. Eventually, at
the highest Reynolds numbers tested, it appeared that the passage of a single
bubble was suﬃcient to trigger a “patch” of attached cavitation (Figure 7.5,
bottom), which would persist for an extended period after the bubble had long
disappeared. This progression of events and the changes in the probabilities of
the diﬀerent kinds of events with Reynolds number imply a rich complexity in
the micro-ﬂuidmechanics of cavitation bubbles, much of which remains to be
understood. Its importance lies in the fact that these diﬀerent types of events
cause diﬀerences in the collapse process which, in turn, alters the noise pro-
duced (see Kuhn de Chizelle et al. 1992b) and, in all probability, the potential

for cavitation damage. For example, the events with attached tails were found
to produce signiﬁcantly less noise than the events without tails. Due to the
changes in the probabilities of occurence of these events with Reynolds num-
ber, this implies a scaling eﬀect that had not been previously recognized. It
also suggests some possible strategies for the reduction of cavitation noise and
damage.
When examined in retrospect, one can identify many of these phenomena in
earlier photographic observations, including the pioneering, high-speed movies
taken by Knapp. As previously noted, Knapp and Hollander (1948), Parkin
(1952), and others noted the spherical-cap shape of most traveling cavitation
bubbles. The ITTC experiments (Lindgren and Johnsson 1966) emphasized the
diversity in the kinds of cavitation events that could occur on a given body,
and later authors attempted to identify, understand, and classify this spectrum
of events. For example, Holl and Carroll (1979) observed a variety of diﬀer-
ent types of cavitation events on axisymmetric bodies and remarked that both
traveling and attached cavitation “patches” occurred and could be distinguished
from traveling bubble cavitation. A similar study of the diﬀerent types of cav-

itation events was reported by Huang (1979), whose “spots” are synonymous
with “patches.”
7.5
LARGE-SCALE CAVITATION
STRUCTURES
When the density of cavitation events becomes large enough, they begin to in-
teract and to alter the ﬂow in a signiﬁcant way. This increase in density may
come about as a result of a decrease in the cavitation number, which causes the
activation of increasingly smaller nuclei, or it may result from an increase in the
population of nuclei in the oncoming stream. As long as the interaction eﬀects
are small, they seem to cause a decrease in the rate of growth of the bubbles
(see, for example, Arakeri and Shanmuganathan 1985) and a shift in the spec-
trum of the cavitation noise (see, for example, Marboe, Billet, and Thompson
1986). Signiﬁcant progress has been made in developing analytical models that
incorporate such weak interaction eﬀects on traveling bubble cavitation; these
models are described in chapter 6.
An example of dense traveling bubble cavitation is included in Figure 7.6.
Note that the bubbles seem to merge to form a single vapor-ﬁlled wake near the
trailing edge of the foil. Notice also the wispy trails of very small air bubbles that
remain after the vapor-ﬁlled cavity collapses. In a water tunnel special eﬀorts
are required to allow these ﬁne bubbles suﬃcient time to dissolve before they
recirculate back to the working section. Without such eﬀorts the population of
small bubbles in the tunnel would quickly reach unacceptable levels. Even with
special eﬀorts it is clear that cavitation itself contributes to the population of
nuclei in a closed loop water tunnel.
The large-scale cavitation structures that are formed when the cavitation
number is reduced can take a variety of forms, and we review these in the
next few sections. In many practical devices such as pumps or propellers, the
ﬁrst large-scale structure to be observed as the cavitation number is decreased
takes the form of a cavitating vortex, so we begin with a discussion of vortex
cavitation.
7.6
VORTEX CAVITATION
Many high Reynolds number ﬂows of practical importance contain a region of
concentrated vorticity where the pressure in the vortex core is often signiﬁcantly
smaller than in the rest of the ﬂow. Such is the case, for example, in the tip
vortices of ship’s propellers or pump impellers or in the swirling ﬂow in the
draft tube of a water turbine. It follows that cavitation inception often occurs
in these vortices and that, with further reduction of the cavitation number,
the entire core of the vortex may become ﬁlled with vapor.
Naturally, the
term “vortex cavitation” is used for these circumstances.
In Figures 7.7 to
7.12 we present some examples of this particular kind of large-scale cavitation

hydrofoil at zero incidence angle, a speed of 13.7 m/s and a cavitation number
of 0.3. The ﬂow is from left to right and the leading edge of the foil is just to
the left of the white glare patch on the surface (Kermeen 1956).

structure.
Figure 7.7 consists of photographs of cavitating tip vortices on a
ﬁnite aspect ratio hydrofoil at an angle of attack.
In those experiments of
Higuchi, Rogers, and Arndt (1986) cavitation inception occurred in the vortex
some distance downstream of the tip at a cavitation number of about σ = 1.4.
With further decrease in pressure the cavitation in the core becomes continuous,
as illustrated by the picture on the left in Figure 7.7. This transition is probably
triggered by an accumulation of individual bubbles in the core; they will tend to

migrate to the center of the vortex due to the centrifugal pressure gradient. With
further decrease in σ, bubble and/or sheet cavitation appear on the hydrofoil
surface (Figure 7.7, photograph on right) and disturb the tip vortex which is
nevertheless still apparent. Cavitating tip vortices are also quite apparent in
unshrouded pump impellers as illustrated by Figure 7.8.
When continuous cavitating tip vortices occur at the tips of the blades of
a propeller they create a surprisingly stable ﬂow structure. As illustrated by
Figure 7.9 the intertwined, helical cavitating vortices from the blade tips can
persist for a long distance downstream of the propeller.
Clearly cavitation can occur in any vortex, and Figures 7.10 and 7.11 present
two further examples. Figure 7.10 shows a typical picture of a cavitating vor-
tex in the swirling ﬂow in the draft tube of a Francis turbine.
Often these
draft tube vortices can exhibit quite complex patterns of unsteady ﬂow. The
vortices in a turbulent mixing layer or wake will also cavitate, as illustrated
in Figure 7.11, a photograph of the separated wake behind a lifting ﬂat plate
with a ﬂap. Looking closely at the structures in this turbulent ﬂow, one can
identify not only the large transverse vortices that contain many bubbles, but
also the ﬁlament-like longitudinal vortices ﬁrst identiﬁed in a single-phase mix-
ing layer ﬂow by Bernal and Roshko (1986).
After that discovery by Bernal
and Roshko one could recognize this secondary vortex structure in photographs
of cavitating wakes and mixing layers taken many years previously, and yet its
importance was not appreciated at the time. The streamwise vortices can play

a particularly important role in cavitation inception. Katz and O’Hern (1986)
have shown that, when streamwise vortices are present, inception occurs in these
longitudinal structures before it occurs in the primary or transverse vortices.
The three-dimensional shedding of vortices from a ﬁnite aspect ratio foil or
other device can often lead to the formation and propagation of a ring vortex
with a vapor/gas core. Figure 7.12 shows such a cavitating vortex ring that has
just emerged from the closure region of an attached cavity on an oscillating foil.
Often these ring vortices can persist for quite a distance as they are convected
downstream. Another example is shown in Figure 7.13; in this case the vortex
shedding is caused by the natural oscillations of a partially cavitating foil (see
Section 7.9). The cavitating ring vortex has its own velocity of propagation
relative to the surrounding ﬂuid and has therefore moved substantially above
the rest of the wake at the moment when the photograph was taken.
7.7
CLOUD CAVITATION
In many ﬂows of practical interest one observes the periodic formation and
collapse of a “cloud” of cavitation bubbles. Such a structure is termed “cloud
cavitation.” The temporal periodicity may occur naturally as a result of the
shedding of cavitating vortices (see, for example, Figure 7.11), or it may be
the response to a periodic disturbance imposed on the ﬂow. Common examples
of imposed ﬂuctuations are the interaction between rotor and stator blades
in a pump or turbine and the interaction between a ship’s propeller and the
nonuniform wake created by the hull.
In many of these cases the coherent
collapse of the cloud of bubbles (see, for example, Figure 3.14) can cause more
intense noise and more potential for damage than in a similar nonﬂuctuating
ﬂow (see Section 3.7). Bark and van Berlekom (1978), Shen and Peterson (1978),
Franc and Michel (1988), Kubota et al. (1989), and Hart et al. (1990) have
studied the complicated ﬂow patterns involved in the production and collapse

of a cavitating cloud on an oscillating hydrofoil. These studies are exempliﬁed
by the photographs of Figure 7.14, which show the formation, separation, and
collapse of a cavitation cloud on a hydrofoil oscillating in pitch. All of these
studies emphasize that a substantial bang occurs as a result of the collapse
of the cloud; in Figure 7.14 this occurred between the middle and right-hand
photographs.
Cloud cavitation continues to be a primary concern for propeller and pump
manufacturers and is currently the subject of active research. In Chapter 6 we
presented some simpliﬁed, analytical investigations that provided some qualita-
tive information on the coherent dynamics of these structures. More accurate
modeling of these complex, unsteady multiphase ﬂows poses some challenging
problems that have only begun to be addressed. The recent numerical modeling
by Kubota, Kato, and Yamaguchi (1992) is an important step in this direction.
7.8
ATTACHED OR SHEET CAVITATION
Another class of large-scale cavitation structures is that which occurs when a
wake or region of separated ﬂow ﬁlls with vapor. Referring back to Figure 7.6,
we note that Kermeen (1956) only observed dense traveling bubbles when the
angle of attack was small. At angles of attack greater than about 10◦(or less
than about −2◦) cavitation occurred as a single vapor-ﬁlled separation zone as
illustrated in Figure 7.15. This form of cavitation on a hydrofoil or propeller
blade is usually termed “sheet” cavitation; in the context of pumps it is known
as “blade” cavitation.
Bluﬀbodies often exhibit a sudden transition from traveling bubble cavi-
tation to a single vapor-ﬁlled wake as the cavitation number is decreased. An
example is shown in Figure 7.16 which includes two photographs of a cavitating
sphere; the transition occurs when the bubbly wake in the picture on the left
suddenly becomes a single vapor-ﬁlled void as seen in the picture on the right.
Figure 7.14: Three frames illustrating the formation, separation, and collapse
of a cavitation cloud on the suction surface of a hydrofoil (0.152 m chord)

mean incidence angle of 5◦. The ﬂow is from left to right, the tunnel velocity is
7.5 m/s and the mean cavitation number is 1.1. Photographs by E.McKenney.

1.05 (Kermeen 1956). The ﬂow is from left to right.

photographs shows bubble cavitation and bubbly wake prior to the transition
to the fully developed cavity shown on the right (Brennen 1970). The ﬂow is
from right to left, the velocities being 5.6 m/s and 10.7 m/s, respectively.
In the context of bluﬀbodies, a vapor-ﬁlled wake is often called a “fully devel-
oped” or “attached” cavity. Clearly sheet, blade, fully developed, and attached
cavities are terms for the same large-scale cavitation structure.
When a sharp edge provides a clean deﬁnition for the leading edge of a fully
developed cavity, the surface of that cavity is often glassy smooth since the
separating boundary layer is usually laminar. This initially smooth surface can
be seen in the right-hand photograph of Figure 7.16 and in the photographs of
Figure 7.17. Depending on the shape of the forebody the interfacial boundary

respectively.

layer may rapidly undergo transition to a turbulent interfacial layer, as is the
case in the photograph of the cavitating ogive in Figure 7.17 and the cavitating
sphere in the photograph on the right of Figure 7.16.
For other headforms
transition may be delayed almost indeﬁnitely, as in the case of the cavitating
disc of Figure 7.17 (see Brennen 1970).
When there is no sharp edge to initiate a fully developed cavity, several
diﬀerent phenomena may occur. Cavitation separation may still occur along a
well-deﬁned and stable line on the body surface, as exempliﬁed by the photo-
graph on the right in Figure 7.16. Or the separation line may be interrupted,
as in the photograph of Figure 7.18. For example, such a scalloped leading edge
is typical of cavitation in bearings (Dowson and Taylor 1979).
Other forms of developed cavitation can be strikingly diﬀerent from that of
Figures 7.17 or 7.18. Sometimes the cavities occur as streaks, as exempliﬁed by
the photograph in Figure 7.19 of cavitation on the surface of a biconvex hydrofoil
(Arakeri 1975). Again a tranverse periodicity appears to occur in which one can
envisage that the expansion of the ﬂow in the streamtubes containing cavities
results in an increase in the pressure in the ﬂuid in between these cavitating
streamtubes and therefore inhibits further lateral spreading of the cavitation.
Currently there does not appear to be any clear understanding of the reason for
the transverse periodicity of Figures 7.18 and 7.19.

7.9
CAVITATING FOILS
On a lifting foil (a hydrofoil), attached cavitation can take a number of forms,
as discussed in the review by Acosta (1973). When, as sketched in Figure 7.20,
the attached cavity closes on the suction surface of the foil, the condition is
referred to as “partial cavitation.” This is the form of attached cavitation most
commonly observed on propellers and in pumps. At lower cavitation numbers,
the cavity may close well downstream of the trailing edge of the foil, as shown
in the lower sketch in Figure 7.20.
Such a conﬁguration is termed “super-
cavitation” and propellers for high-speed boats are often designed to be operated
under these conditions.
In between these regimes, experiments have shown
(Wade and Acosta 1966) that, when the length of the cavity is close to the
length of the foil (between about 3/4 and 4/3 times the chord), the ﬂow becomes
unstable and the size of the cavity ﬂuctuates quite violently between these limits.
During this ﬂuctuation cycle, the cavity lengthens fairly smoothly. On the other
hand, it shortens by a process of “pinching-oﬀ” of a large cloud of bubbles from
the rear of the cavity, and this cloud can collapse quite violently as described
previously. However, there is also shed vorticity bound up in the cloud, and
this is concentrated by the collapse of the cloud. One result is the formation of
the vortex ring seen in Figure 7.13. In pumps and other devices, this condition
between partial and supercavitation clearly needs to be avoided because of the
potential damage that can result. Further discussion of this oscillating cavity
phenomenon is included in Section 8.8. It should also be noted that cavities
may ﬂuctuate for other reasons, as discussed in the next section.
Methods for the analysis of both partially and supercavitating ﬂows are
discussed in the next chapter.

partial cavitation (b) supercavitation.

7.10
CAVITY CLOSURE
The ﬂow in the vicinity of cavity closure deserves further comment because it
is quite complex and involves processes that have not, as yet, been discussed.
First, the ﬂow is invariably turbulent since the boundary layer, which detaches
from the body along with the free surface, produces an interfacial boundary
layer. This is almost always unstable and undergoes transition to yield a tur-
bulent interfacial layer (Brennen 1970). The level of turbulence in this layer
grows rapidly as the closure region is approached, so the ﬂow in that vicinity
usually appears as a frothy turbulent mixing motion. Where the two free sur-
face streams collide, some ﬂow is deﬂected back into the cavity. Observations
of this “reentrant jet” were part of the motivation for the reentrant jet model
of cavity closure, which is sometimes employed in potential ﬂow solutions (see
Section 8.2). However, actual reentrant jets are nothing like as coherent as the
jet in that model; they could better be described as a frothy turbulent mass
tumbling back into the cavity.
Changes to the structure of the ﬂow in the closure region can occur in hor-
izontal ﬂows when the buoyancy forces become signiﬁcant. Such will be the
case when the Froude number based on cavity length, ℓ, F r = U∞
$
(gℓ)
1
2 , is
less than some critical value denoted by F rc. For bodies of small aspect ratio
(such as axisymmetric headforms) it appears that F rc ≈2.5 (Brennen 1969)
and, when F r < F rc, the reentrant jet structure no longer occurs. Instead, a
pair of counter-rotating vortices with gas/vapor cores form in the closure region
(Cox and Claydon 1956); this type of closure is much steadier and less turbulent
than the reentrant jet type, which is prevalent at higher Froude numbers. The
rate at which vapor/gas can be entrained by the counter-rotating vortex closure
is much higher than for the reentrant jet closure (Brennen 1969).
Returning to our discussion of the reentrant jet form of cavity closure, we
note that this ﬂow can also exhibit signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations. These ﬂuctuations
can be caused by vortex shedding from the rear of the cavity (Young and Holl
1966); they may also be the result of some other, less well understood instabil-
ity associated with this complex multiphase ﬂow. Knapp (1955) ﬁrst described
the cyclic process in which a “pinching oﬀ” mechanism (similar to that de-
scribed in the last section) produces vortices that initially have large, bubbly
vapor/gas cores (see also Furness and Hutton 1975). As the vapor condenses
and the core of the cloud/vortex collapses, the vorticity is concentrated and the
vortices become more intense before they enter the normal, single-phase wake
ﬂow. After condensation, only small, remnant gas bubbles containing the resid-
ual noncondensable component remain to be convected away into the far wake.
It is, incidentally, this supply of microbubbles to the tunnel population that
neccessitates the use of a resorber in a cavitation tunnel (see Section 1.15).
It should also be noted that under some circumstances this cyclic process in
the cavity closure region is more evident than in others. Moreover, there are
several other instabilities that can trigger or promote such a cyclic shedding pro-
cess. We have already discussed one such instability in the preceding section, the
partial cavitation instability. A somewhat similar cavity pulsation phenomenon

occurs when large super-cavities are created by supplying noncondensable gas
to the wake of a body. Such cavities, which are visually almost indistinguish-
able from their natural or vapor-ﬁlled counterparts, are known as “ventilated”
cavities. However, when the gas supplied is increased to the point at which
the entrainment processes in the closure region (see below) are unable to carry
away that volume of gas, the cavity may begin to ﬂuctuate; a pinching-oﬀpro-
cess sheds a large gas volume into the wake, and this is followed by regrowth of
the cavity. This phenomenon was investigated by Silberman and Song (1961)
and Song (1962). Finally, we should mention one other process that may be at
work in the closure region. In the case of predominantly vapor-ﬁlled cavities
Jakobsen (1964) has suggested that a condensation shock provides a mechanism
for cavity closure (simple shocks of this kind were analysed in Section 6.9). This
last suggestion deserves more study than it has received to date.
Both the large-scale ﬂuctuations and the small-scale turbulence in the clo-
sure region act to entrain bubbles and thus remove vapor/gas from the cavity,
though it is clear from the preceding paragraphs that the precise mechanisms
of entrainment may diﬀer considerably from one closure conﬁguration to an-
other. Measurements of the volume rate of entrainment for large cavities with
the steady, reentrant jet type of closure (for example, Brennen 1969) suggest
that the volume rate increases with velocity as U n
∞where n is a little larger than
unity. Using axisymmetric headforms of diﬀerent size, b, Billet and Weir (1975)
showed that though the volume entrainment rate scaled approximately with
U∞b2, there was a signiﬁcant variation with cavitation number, σ, the volume
rate increasing substantially as σ decreased and the cavity became larger.
Under steady-state conditions, the removal of vapor and noncondensable
gas by entrainment in the closure region is balanced by the supply process of
evaporation and the release of gas from solution along the length of the free
surface. These supply processes will, in turn, be aﬀected by the state of the
interfacial boundary layer. A turbulent layer will clearly enhance the heat and
mass diﬀusion processes that produce evaporation and the release of gas from
solution. One of the consequences of the balance between the supply of non-
condensable gas (air) and its removal by entrainment is the inherent regulation
of the partial pressure of the noncondensable gas (air) in the cavity. Brennen
(1969) put together a simpliﬁed model of these processes and showed that the
results for the partial pressure of air were in rough agreement with experimental
measurements of that partial pressure. Moreover, there is an analogous balance
of heat in which the latent heat removed by the entrainment process must be
balanced by the heat diﬀused to the cavity through the interfacial layer. This
requires a cavity temperature below that of the surrounding liquid. (This ther-
mal eﬀect in fully developed cavity ﬂows is analogous to the thermal eﬀect in
the dynamics of individual bubbles described in Sections 2.3 and 2.7.) The tem-
perature depression produced by this process has been investigated by a number
of authors including Holl, Billet, and Weir (1975). Though it is usually small in
water at normal temperatures, it can be signiﬁcant at higher temperatures or in
other liquids at temperatures similar to those at which single bubbles experience
signiﬁcant thermal eﬀects on growth (see Section 2.7).

Chapter 8
FREE STREAMLINE
FLOWS
8.1
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we brieﬂy survey the extensive literature on fully developed
cavity ﬂows and the methods used for their solution. The terms “free streamline
ﬂow” or “free surface ﬂow” are used for those situations that involve a “free”
surface whose location is initially unknown and must be found as a part of
the solution.
In the context of some of the multiphase ﬂow literature, they
would be referred to as separated ﬂows. In the introduction to Chapter 6 we
described the two asymptotic states of a multiphase ﬂow, homogeneous and
separated ﬂow. Chapter 6 described some of the homogeneous ﬂow methods and
their application to cavitating ﬂows; this chapter presents the other approach.
However, we shall not use the term separated ﬂow in this context because of the
obvious confusion with the accepted, ﬂuid mechanical use of the term.
Fully developed cavity ﬂows constitute one subset of free surface ﬂows, and
this survey is intended to provide information on some of the basic properties
of these ﬂows as well as the methods that have been used to generate analytical
solutions of them. A number of excellent reviews of free streamline methods can
be found in the literature, including those of Birkkoﬀand Zarantonello (1957),
Parkin (1959), Gilbarg (1960), Woods (1961), Gurevich (1961), Sedov (1966),
and Wu (1969, 1972). Here we shall follow the simple and elegant treatment of
Wu (1969, 1972).
The subject of free streamline methods has an interesting history, for one
can trace its origins to the work of Kirchhoﬀ(1869), who ﬁrst proposed the
idea of a “wake” bounded by free streamlines as a model for the ﬂow behind
a ﬁnite, bluﬀbody. He used the mathematical methods of Helmholtz (1868)
to ﬁnd the irrotational solution for a ﬂat plate set normal to an oncoming
stream. The pressure in the wake was assumed to be constant and equal to the
upstream pressure. Under these conditions (the zero cavitation number solution
245

described below) the wake extends inﬁnitely far downstream of the body. The
drag on the body is nonzero, and Kirchhoﬀproposed this as the solution to
D’Alembert’s paradox (see Section 5.2), thus generating much interest in these
free streamline methods, which Levi-Civita (1907) later extended to bodies with
curved surfaces. It is interesting to note that Kirchhoﬀ’s work appeared many
years before Prandtl discovered boundary layers and the reason for the wake
structure behind a body. However, Kirchhoﬀmade no mention of the possible
application of his methods to cavity ﬂows; indeed, the existence of these ﬂows
does not seem to have been recognized until many years later.
In this review we focus on the application of free streamline methods to fully
developed cavity ﬂows; for a modern view of their application to wake ﬂows the
reader is referred to Wu (1969, 1972). It is important to take note of the fact
that, because of its low density relative to that of the liquid, the nature of the
vapor or gas in the fully developed cavity usually has little eﬀect on the liquid
ﬂow. Thus the pressure gradients due to motion of the vapor/gas are normally
negligible relative to the pressure gradients in the liquid, and consequently it
is usually accurate to assume that the pressure, pc, acting on the free surface
is constant. Similarly, the shear stress that the vapor/gas imposes on the free
surface is usually negligible. Moreover, other than the eﬀect on pc, it is of little
consequence whether the cavity contains vapor or noncondensable gas, and the
eﬀect of pc is readily accommodated in the context of free streamline ﬂows by
deﬁning the cavitation number, σ, as
σ = p∞−pc
1
2ρLU 2∞
(8.1)
where pc has replaced the pV of the previous deﬁnition and we may consider
pc to be due to any combination of vapor and gas. It follows that the same
free streamline analysis is applicable whether the cavity is a true vapor cavity
or whether the wake has been ﬁlled with noncondensable gas externally intro-
duced into the “cavity.” The formation of such gas-ﬁlled wakes is known as
“ventilation.” Ventilated cavities can occur either because of deliberate air in-
jection into a wake or cavity, or they may occur in the ocean due to naturally
occurring communication between, say, a propeller blade wake and the atmo-
sphere above the ocean surface.
For a survey of ventilation phenomena the
reader is referred to Acosta (1973).
Most of the available free streamline methods assume inviscid, irrotational
and incompressible ﬂow, and comparisons with experimental data suggest, as
we shall see, that these are reasonable approximations. Viscous eﬀects in fully
developed cavity ﬂows are usually negligible so long as the free streamline de-
tachment locations (see Figure 8.1) are ﬁxed by the geometry of the body. The
most signiﬁcant discrepancies occur when detachment is not ﬁxed but is located
at some initially unknown point on a smooth surface (see Section 8.3). Then
diﬀerences between the calculated and observed detachment locations can cause
substantial discrepancies in the results.
Assuming incompressible and irrotational ﬂow, the problems require solution

ysis.
of Laplace’s equation for the velocity potential, φ(xi, t),

(8.2)
subject to the following boundary conditions:
1. On a solid surface, SW(xi, t), the kinematic condition of no ﬂow through
that surface requires that
dSW
dt
= ∂SW
∂t
+ (∇φ) · ∇SW = 0
(8.3)
2. On a free surface, SF (xi, t), a similar kinematic condition that neglects
the liquid evaporation rate yields
dSF
dt
= ∂SF
∂t + (∇φ) · ∇SF = 0
(8.4)
3. Assuming that the pressure in the cavity, pc, is uniform and constant,
leads to an additional dynamic boundary condition on SF . Clearly, the
dimensionless equivalent of pc, namely σ, is a basic parameter in this class
of problem and must be speciﬁed a priori.
In steady ﬂow, neglecting
surface tension and gravitational eﬀects, the magnitude of the velocity on
the free surface, qc, should be uniform and equal to U∞(1 + σ)
1
2 .
The two conditions on the free surface create serious modeling problems both
at the detachment points and in the cavity closure region (Figure 8.1). These
issues will the addressed in the two sections that follow.

In planar, two-dimensional ﬂows the powerful methods of complex variables
and the properties of analytic functions (see, for example, Churchill 1948) can
be used with great eﬀect to obtain solutions to these irrotational ﬂows (see the
review articles and books mentioned above). Indeed, the vast majority of the
published literature is devoted to such methods and, in particular, to steady,
incompressible, planar potential ﬂows. Under those circumstances the complex
velocity potential, f, and the complex conjugate velocity, w, deﬁned by
f = φ + iψ
;
w = df
dz = u −iv
(8.5)
are both analytic functions of the position vector z = x + iy in the physical,
(x, y) plane of the ﬂow. In this context it is conventional to use i rather than
j to denote (−1)
1
2 and we adopt this notation. It follows that the solution to a
particular ﬂow problem consists of determining the form of the function, f(z)
or w(z). Often this takes a parametric form in which f(ζ) (or w(ζ)) and z(ζ)
are found as functions of some parametric variable, ζ = ξ + iη. Another very
useful device is the logarithmic hodograph variable, ϖ, deﬁned by
ϖ = log qc
w = χ + iθ
;
χ = ln qc
|w|
;
θ = tan−1 v
u
(8.6)
The value of this variable lies in the fact that its real part is known on a free
surface, whereas its imaginary part is known on a solid surface.
8.2
CAVITY CLOSURE MODELS
Addressing ﬁrst the closure problem, it is clear that most of the complex pro-
cesses that occur in this region and that were described in Section 7.10 cannot
be incorporated into a potential ﬂow model. Moreover, it is also readily appar-
ent that the condition of a prescribed free surface velocity would be violated
at a rear stagnation point such as that depicted in Figure 8.1. It is therefore
necessary to resort to some artifact in the vicinity of this rear stagnation point
in order to eﬀect termination of the cavity. A number of closure models have
been devised; some of the most common are depicted in Figures 8.2 and 8.3.
Each has its own advantages and deﬁciences:
1. Riabouchinsky (1920) suggested one of the simpler models, in which an
“image” of the body is placed in the closure region so that the streamlines
close smoothly onto this image. In the case of planar or axisymmetric bod-
ies appropriate shapes for the image are readily found; such is not the case
for general three-dimensional bodies. The advantage of the Riabouchinsky
model is the simplicity of the geometry and of the mathematical solution.
Since the combination of the body, its image, and the cavity eﬀectively
constitutes a ﬁnite body, it must satisfy D’Alembert’s paradox, and there-
fore the drag force on the image must be equal and opposite to that on
the body. Also note that the rear stagnation point is no longer located

Figure 8.2: Closure models for the potential ﬂow around an arbitrary body

as shown. In planar ﬂow, these geometries in the physical or z-plane transform
to the geometries shown in Figure 8.11.
on a free surface but has been removed to the surface of the image. The
deﬁciences of the Riabouchinsky model are the artiﬁciality of the image
body and the fact that the streamlines downstream are an image of those
upstream. The model would be more realistic if the streamlines down-
stream of the body-cavity system were displaced outward relative to their
locations upstream of the body in order to simulate the eﬀect of a wake.
Nevertheless, it remains one of the most useful models, especially when
the cavity is large, since the pressure distribution and therefore the force
on the body is not substantially aﬀected by the presence of the distant
image body.
2. Joukowski (1890) proposed solving the closure problem by satisfying the
dynamic free surface condition only up to a certain point on the free
streamlines (the points C and C′ in Figure 8.2) and then somehow con-
tinuing these streamlines to downstream inﬁnity, thus simulating a wake
extending to inﬁnity.
This is known as the “open-wake model.”
For
symmetric, pure-drag bodies these continuations are usually parallel with
the uniform stream (Roshko 1954). Wu (1956, 1962) and Mimura (1958)
extended this model to planar ﬂows about lifting bodies for which the
conditions on the continued streamlines are more complex. The advan-
tage of the open-wake model is its simplicity. D’Alembert’s paradox no

longer applies since the eﬀective body is now inﬁnite. The disadvantage is
that the wake is signiﬁcantly larger than the real wake (Wu, Whitney, and
Brennen 1971). In this sense the Riabouchinsky and open-wake models
bracket the real ﬂow.
3. The “reentrant jet” model, which was ﬁrst formulated by Kreisel (1946)
and Efros (1946), is also shown in Figure 8.2. In this model, a jet ﬂows
into the cavity from the closure region. Thus the rear stagnation point, R,
has been shifted oﬀthe free surfaces into the body of the ﬂuid. Moreover,
D’Alembert’s paradox is again avoided because the eﬀective body is no
longer simple and ﬁnite; one can visualize the momentum ﬂux associated
with the reentrant jet as balancing the drag on the body.
One of the
motivations for the model is that reentrant jets are often observed in real
cavity ﬂows, as discussed in Section 7.10. In practice the jet impacts one
of the cavity surfaces and is reentrained in an unsteady and unmodeled
fashion. In the mathematical model the jet disappears onto a second Rie-
mann sheet.
This represents a deﬁciency in the model since it implies
an unrealistic removal of ﬂuid from the ﬂow and consequently a wake of
“negative thickness.” In one of the few detailed comparisons with experi-
mental observations, Wu et al. (1971) found that the reentrant jet model
did not yield results for the drag that were as close to the experimental
observations as the results for the Riabouchinsky and open-wake models.
4. Two additional models for planar, two-dimensional ﬂow were suggested
by Tulin (1953, 1964) and are depicted in Figure 8.3. In these models,
termed the “single spiral vortex model” and the “double spiral vortex
model,” the free streamlines terminate in a vortex at the points P and
P ′ from which emerge the bounding streamlines of the “wake” on which
the velocity is assumed to be U∞. The shapes of the two wake bounding
streamlines are assumed to be identical, and their separation vanishes
Figure 8.3: Two additional closure models for planar ﬂow suggested by Tulin
(1953, 1964). The free streamlines end in the center of the vortices at the points
P and P ′ which are also the points of origin of the wake boundary streamlines
on which the velocity is equal to U∞.

far downstream. The double spiral vortex model has proved particularly
convenient mathematically (see, for example, Furuya 1975a) and has the
attractive feature of incorporating a wake thickness that is ﬁnite but not
as unrealistically large as that of the open-wake model. The single spiral
vortex model has been extensively used by Tulin and others in the context
of the linearized or small perturbation theory of cavity ﬂows (see Section
8.7).
Not included in this list are a number of other closure models that have
either proved mathematically diﬃcult to implement or depart more radically
from the observations of real cavities. For a discussion of these the reader is
referred to Wu (1969, 1972) or Tulin (1964). Moreover, most of the models
and much of the above discussion assume that the ﬂow is steady. Additional
considerations are necessary when modeling unsteady cavity ﬂows (see Section
8.12).
8.3
CAVITY DETACHMENT MODELS
The other regions of the ﬂow that require careful consideration are the points at
which the free streamlines “detach” from the body. We use the word “detach-
ment” to avoid confusion with the process of separation of the boundary layer.
Thus the words “separation point” are reserved for boundary layer separation.
Since most of the mathematical models assume incompressible and irrota-
tional potential ﬂow, it is necessary to examine the prevailing conditions at a
point at which a streamline in such a ﬂow detaches from a solid surface. We
ﬁrst observe that if the pressure in the cavity is assumed to be lower than at
any other point in the liquid, then the free surface must be convex viewed from
the liquid. This precludes free streamlines with negative curvatures (the sign
is taken to be positive for a convex surface). Second, we distinguish between
the two geometric circumstances shown in Figure 8.4. Abrupt detachment is
the term applied to the case in which the free surface leaves the solid body at a
vertex or discontinuity in the slope of the body surface.
For convenience in the discussion we deﬁne a coordinate system, (s, n), whose
origin is at the detachment point or vertex. The direction of the coordinate, s,
coincides with the direction of the velocity vector at the detachment point and
the coordinate, n, is perpendicular to the solid surface. It is suﬃciently accurate
for present purposes to consider the ﬂow to be locally planar and to examine
the nature of the potential ﬂow solutions in the immediate neighborhood of
the detachment point, D. Speciﬁcally, it is important to identify the singular
behavior at D. This is most readily accomplished by using polar coordinates,
(r, ϑ), where z = s + in = r eiϑ, and by considering the expansion of the

and the following properties of the ﬂow at an abrupt detachment point then
become evident. First, from Equation (8.8) it is clear that the acceleration of
the ﬂuid tends to inﬁnity as one approaches the detachment point along the
wetted surface. This, in turn, implies an inﬁnite, favorable pressure gradient.
Moreover, in order for the wetted surface velocity to be lower than that on the
free surface (and therefore for the wetted surface pressure to be higher than that
in the cavity), it is necessary for C to be a positive constant. Second, since the
shape of the free surface, ψ = 0, is given by

it follows that the curvature of that surface becomes inﬁnite as the detachment
point is approached along the free surface. The sign of C also implies that the
free surface is convex viewed from within the liquid. The modiﬁcations to these
characteristics as a result of a boundary layer in a real ﬂow were studied by
Ackerberg (1970); it seems that the net eﬀect of the boundary layer on abrupt
detachment is not very signiﬁcant.
We shall delay further discussion of the
practical implications of these analytical results until later.
Turning attention to the other possibility sketched in Figure 8.4, “smooth
detachment,” one must ﬁrst ask why it should be any diﬀerent from abrupt
detachment. The reason is apparent from one of the results of the preceding

paragraph. An inﬁnite, convex free-surface curvature at the detachment point is
geometrically impossible at a smooth detachment point because the free surface
would then cut into the solid surface.
However, the position of the smooth
detachment point is initially unknown.
One can therefore consider a whole
family of solutions to the particular ﬂow, each with a diﬀerent detachment
point. There may be one such solution for which the strength of the singularity,
C, is identically zero, and this solution, unlike all the others, is viable since its
free surface does not cut into the solid surface. Thus the condition that the
strength of the singularity, C, be zero determines the location of the smooth
detachment point. These circumstances and this condition were ﬁrst recognized
independently by Brillouin (1911) and by Villat (1914), and the condition has
become known as the Brillouin-Villat condition. Though normally applied in
planar ﬂow problems, it has also been used by Armstrong (1953), Armstrong
and Tadman (1954), and Brennen (1969a) in axisymmetric ﬂows.
The singular behavior at a smooth detachment point can be examined in a
manner similar to the above analysis of an abrupt detachment point. Since the

from Armstrong and Tadman (1954) and Brennen (1969a), in the latter case
for diﬀerent water tunnel to sphere radius ratios, B/b (see Figure 8.15). The
experimental results are for diﬀerent sphere diameters as follows: 7.62 cm (⊙)
and 2.86 cm (2) from Brennen (1969a), 5.08 cm (△) and 3.81 cm (▽) from
Hsu and Perry (1954). Tunnel velocities are indicated by the additional ticks at

where C is a diﬀerent real constant, the strength of the three-half power sin-
gularity. By parallel evaluation of w and f one can determine the following
properties of the ﬂow at a smooth detachment point. The velocity and pres-
sure gradients approach zero (rather than inﬁnity) as the detachment point is
approached along the wetted surface. Also, the curvature of the free surface ap-
proaches that of the solid surface as the detachment point is approached along
the free surface. Thus the name “smooth detachment” seems appropriate.
Having established these models for the detachment of the free streamlines
in potential ﬂow, it is important to emphasize that they are models and that
viscous boundary-layer and surface-energy eﬀects (surface tension and contact
angle) that are omitted from the above discussions will, in reality, have a sub-
stantial inﬂuence in determining the location of the actual detachment points.
This can be illustrated by comparing the locations of smooth detachment from
a cavitating sphere with experimentally measured locations. As can readily be
seen from Figures 8.5 and 8.6, the predicted detachment locations are substan-
tially upstream of the actual detachment points. Moreover, the experimental
data exhibit some systematic variations with the size of the sphere and the
tunnel velocity. Exploring these scaling eﬀects, Brennen (1969b) interpolated

between the data to construct the variations with Reynolds number shown in
Figure 8.6. This data clearly indicates that the detachment locations are de-
termined primarily by viscous, boundary-layer eﬀects. However, one must add
that all of the experimental data used for Figure 8.6 was for metal spheres and
that surface-energy eﬀects and, in particular, contact-angle eﬀects probably also
play an important role (see Ackerberg 1975). The eﬀect of the surface tension
of the liquid seems to be relatively minor (Brennen 1970).
It is worth noting that, despite the discrepancies between the observed loca-
tions of detachment and those predicted by the smooth detachment condition,
the proﬁle of the cavity is not as radically aﬀected as one might imagine. Figure
8.7, taken from Brennen (1969a), is a photograph showing the proﬁle of a fully
developed cavity on a sphere. On it is superimposed the proﬁle of the theo-
retical solution. Note the close proximity of the proﬁles despite the substantial
discrepancy in the detachment points.
The viscous ﬂow in the vicinity of an actual smooth detachment point is com-
plex and still remains to be completely understood. Arakeri (1975) examined
this issue experimentally using Schlieren photography to determine the behav-
ior of the boundary layer and observed that boundary layer separation occurred
upstream of free surface detachment as sketched in Figure 8.8 and shown in Fig-
ure 8.9. Arakeri also generated a quasi-empirical approach to the prediction of
the distance between the separation and detachment locations, and this model
seemed to produce detachment positions that were in good agreement with the
observations. Franc and Michel (1985) studied this same issue both analytically
and through experiments on hydrofoils, and their criterion for the detachment
location has been used by several subsequent investigators.
In practice many of the methods used to solve free streamline problems
involving detachment from a smooth surface simply assume a known location
of detachment based on experimental observations (for example, Furuya and

WALL EFFECTS AND
CHOKED FLOWS
Several useful results follow from the application of basic ﬂuid mechanical prin-
ciples to cavity ﬂows constrained by uniform containing walls. Such would be
the case, for example, for experiments in water tunnels. Consequently, in this
section, we focus attention on the issue of wall eﬀects in cavity ﬂows and on the
related phenomenon of choked ﬂow. Anticipating some of the results of Figures
8.16 and 8.17, we observe that, for the same cavitation number, the narrower the
tunnel relative to the body, the broader and longer the cavity becomes and the

lower the drag coeﬃcient. For a ﬁnite tunnel width, there is a critical cavitation
number, σc, at which the cavity becomes inﬁnitely long and no solutions exist
for σ < σc. The ﬂow is said to be choked at this limiting condition because,
for a ﬁxed tunnel pressure and a ﬁxed cavity pressure, a minimum cavitation
number implies an upper limit to the tunnel velocity. Consequently the choking
phenomenon is analogous to that which occurs in a the nozzle ﬂow of a com-
pressible ﬂuid (see Section 6.5). The phenomenon is familiar to those who have
conducted experiments on fully developed cavity ﬂows in water tunnels. When
one tries to exceed the maximum, choked velocity, the water tunnel pressure
rises so that the cavitation number remains at or above the choked value.
In the choked ﬂow limit of an inﬁnitely long cavity, application of the equa-
tions of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy lead to some simple re-
lationships for the parameters of the ﬂow. Referring to Figure 8.10, consider a
body with a frontal projected area of AB in a water tunnel of cross-sectional
area, AT . In the limit of an inﬁnitely long cavity, the ﬂow far downstream will
be that of a uniform stream in a straight annulus, and therefore conservation of
mass requires that the limiting cross-sectional area of the cavity, AC, be given
by
AC
AT
= 1 −U∞
qc
= 1 −(1 + σc)−1

(8.12)
which leads to
σc ≈2AC
$AT
(8.13)
for the small values of the area ratio that would normally apply in water tunnel
tests. The limiting cavity cross-sectional area, AC, will be larger than the frontal
body area, AB. However, if the body is streamlined these areas will not diﬀer
greatly and therefore, according to Equation (8.12), a ﬁrst approximation to the
value of σc would be
σc ≈1 −

1 −AB
AT
2
(8.14)
Note, as could be anticipated, that the larger the blockage ratio, AB/AT , the
higher the choked cavitation number, σc. Note, also, that the above equations

assume frictionless ﬂow since the relation, qc/U∞= (1 + σ)
1
2 , was used. Hy-
draulic losses along the length of the water tunnel would introduce other eﬀects
in which choking would occur at the end of the tunnel working section in a
manner analogous to the eﬀects of friction in compressible pipe ﬂow.
A second, useful result emerges when the momentum theorem is applied to
the ﬂow, again assumed frictionless. Then, in the limit of choked ﬂow, the drag
coeﬃcient, CD(σc), is given by
CD(σc) = AT

imate validity of this result can be observed in Figure 8.16; it is clear that for

AB ≈2.
Wall eﬀects and choked ﬂow for lifting bodies have been studied by Cohen
and Gilbert (1957), Cohen et al. (1957), Fabula (1964), Ai (1966), and others
because of their importance to the water tunnel testing of hydrofoils. Moreover,
similar phenomena will clearly occur in other internal ﬂow geometries, for ex-
ample that of a pump impeller. The choked cavitation numbers that emerge
from such calculations can be very useful as indicators of the limiting cavitation
operation of turbomachines such as pumps and turbines (see Section 8.9).
Finally, it is appropriate to add some comments on the wall eﬀects in ﬁnite
cavity ﬂows for which σ > σc. It is counterintuitive that the blockage eﬀect
should cause a reduction in the drag at the same cavitation number as illustrated
in Figure 8.16. Another remarkable feature of the wall eﬀect, as Wu et al. (1971)
demonstrate, is that the more streamlined the body the larger the fractional
change in the drag caused by the wall eﬀect. Consequently, it is more important
to estimate and correct for the wall eﬀects on streamline bodies than it is for
bluﬀbodies with the same blockage ratio, AB/AT . Wu et al. (1971) evaluate
these wall eﬀects for the planar ﬂows past cavitating wedges of various vertex
angles (then AB/AT = b/B, ﬁgure 8.15) and suggest the following procedure
for estimating the drag in the absence of wall eﬀects. If during the experiment
one were to measure the minimum coeﬃcient of pressure, Cpw, on the tunnel
wall at the point opposite the maximum width of the cavity, then Wu et al.
recommend use of the following correction rule to estimate the coeﬃcient of
drag in the absence of wall eﬀects, CD(σ′, 0), from the measured coeﬃcient,
CD(σ, b/B). The eﬀective cavitation number for the unconﬁned ﬂow is found
to be σ′ where
σ′ = σ + 2Cpw(2 −σ)
$
3(1 −Cpw)

As illustrated in Figure 8.16, Wu et al. (1971) use experimental data to show
that this correction rule works well for ﬂows around wedges with various vertex
angles.

STEADY PLANAR FLOWS
The classic free streamline solution for an arbitrary ﬁnite body with a fully
developed cavity is obtained by mapping both the geometry of the physical
plane (z-plane, Figure 8.2) and the geometry of the f-plane (Figure 8.11) into
the lower half of a parametric, ζ-plane. The wetted surface is mapped onto
the interval, η = 0, −1 < ξ < 1 and the stagnation point, 0, is mapped into
the origin. For the three closure models of Figure 8.2, the geometries of the
corresponding ζ-planes are sketched in Figure 8.11. The f = f(ζ) mapping
follows from the generalized Schwarz-Christoﬀel transformation (Gilbarg 1949);
for the three closure models of Figures 8.2 and 8.11 this yields respectively

where C is a real constant, ζI is the value of ζ at the point I (the point at
inﬁnity in the z-plane), ζC is the value of ζ at the end of the constant velocity
part of the free streamlines, and ζR and ζJ are the values at the rear stagnation
point and the upstream inﬁnity point in the reentrant jet model.
The wetted surface, AOB, will be given parametrically by x(s), y(s) where s
is the distance measured along that surface from the point A. Then the boundary
conditions on the logarithmic hodograph variable, ϖ = χ + iθ, are
θ−(ξ) ≡θ(ξ, 0−) = πF (−ξ) + θ∗(s(ξ))

where the superscripts + and −will be used to denote values on the ξ axis of
the ζ-plane just above and just below the cut. The function F (−ξ) takes a value
of 1 for ξ < 0 and a value of 0 for ξ > 0. The function θ∗(s) is the inclination
of the wetted surface so that tan θ∗= dy/ds

Now consider the conditions that can be applied to evaluate the unknown
parameters in the problem, namely C and ζI in the case of the Riabouchinsky
model, C, ζI, and ζC in the case of the open-wake model, and C, ζI, ζR, and ζJ
in the case of the reentrant jet model. All three models require that the total
wetted surface length, s(1), be equal to a known value, and this establishes
the length scale in the ﬂow. They also require that the velocity at z →∞
have the known magnitude, U∞, and a given inclination, α, to the chord, AB.
Consequently this condition becomes
ϖ(ζ0) = 1
2 log(1 + σ) + iα
(8.32)
This is suﬃcient to determine the solution for the Riabouchinsky model. Addi-
tional conditions for the open-wake model can be derived from the fact that f(ζ)
must be simply covered in the vicinity of ζ0 and, for the reentrant jet model, that
z(ζ) must be simply covered in the vicinity of ζ0. Also the circulation around
the cavity can be freely chosen in the re-entrant jet model. Finally, if the free
streamline detachment is smooth and therefore initially unknown, its location
must be established using the Brillouin-Villat condition (see Section 8.3). For
further mathematical detail the reader is referred to the texts mentioned earlier
in Section 8.1.
As is the case with all steady planar potential ﬂows involving a body in an
inﬁnite uniform stream, the behavior of the complex velocity, w(z), far from the
body can be particularly revealing. If w(z) is expanded in powers of 1/z then
w(z) = U∞e−iα + Q + iΓ
2π
1
z + (C1 + iC2) 1
z2 + O( 1
z3 )
(8.33)
where U∞and α are the magnitude and inclination of the free stream. The
quantity Q is the net source strength required to simulate the body-cavity sys-
tem and must therefore be zero for a ﬁnite body-cavity. This constitutes a cavity

closure condition. The quantity, Γ, is the circulation around the body-cavity so
that the lift is given by ρU∞Γ. Evaluation of the 1/z term far from the body
provides the simplest way to evaluate the lift.
The mathematical detail involved in producing results from these solutions
(Wu and Wang 1964b) is considerable except for simple symmetric bodies. For
more complex, bluﬀbodies it is probably more eﬃcient to resort to one of
the modern numerical methods (for example a panel method) rather than to
attempt to sort through all the complex algebra of the above solutions. For
streamlined bodies, a third alternative is the algebraically simpler linear theory
for cavity ﬂow, which is brieﬂy reviewed in Section 8.7. There are, however, a
number of valuable results that can be obtained from the above exact, nonlinear
theory, and we will examine just a few of these in the next section.

SOME NONLINEAR RESULTS
Wu (1956, 1962) (see also Mimura 1958) generated the solution for a ﬂat plate
at an arbitrary angle of incidence using the open-wake model and the methods
described in the preceding section. The comparison between the predicted pres-
sure distributions on the surface of the plate and those measured by Fage and
Johansen (1927) in single phase, separated wake ﬂow is excellent, as shown by
the examples in Figure 8.12. Note that the eﬀective cavitation number for the
Figure 8.12: Comparison of pressure distributions on the surface of a ﬂat plate
set at an angle, α, to the oncoming stream. The theory of Wu (1956, 1962)
(solid lines) is compared with the measurements in wake ﬂow made by Fage and
Johansen (1927) (◦). The case on the left is for a ﬂat plate set normal to the
stream (α = 90◦) and a wake coeﬃcient of σ = 1.38; the case on the right is
α = 29.85◦, σ = 0.924. Adapted from Wu (1962).

Figure 8.13: Lift coeﬃcients for a ﬂat plate from the nonlinear theory of Wu
(1962). The experimental data (Parkin 1958) is for angles of incidence as follows:
8◦(▽), 10◦(2), 15◦(△), 20◦(⊕), 25◦(⊗), and 30◦(3). Also shown is some
data of Silberman (1959) in a free jet tunnel: 20◦(+) and 25◦(×).
wake ﬂow (or base pressure coeﬃcient) is not an independent variable as it is
with cavity ﬂows. In Figure 8.12 the values of σ are taken from the experimental
measurements. Data such as that presented in Figure 8.12 provides evidence
that free streamline methods have value in wake ﬂows as well as in cavity ﬂows.
The lift and drag coeﬃcients at various cavitation numbers and angles of
incidence are compared with the experimental data of Parkin (1958) and Sil-
berman (1959) in Figures 8.13 and 8.14. Data both for supercavitating and
partially cavitating conditions are shown in these ﬁgures, the latter occurring
at the higher cavitation numbers and lower incidence angles. The calculations
tend to be quite unstable in the region of transition from the partially cavitating
to the supercavitating state, and so the dashed lines in Figures 8.13 and 8.14
represent smoothed curves in this region. Later, in Section 8.8, we continue the
discussion of this transition. For the present, note that the nonlinear theory
yields values for the lift and the drag that are in good agreement with the ex-
perimental measurements. Wu and Wang (1964a) show similar good agreement

for supercavitating, circular-arc hydrofoils.
The solution to the cavity ﬂow of a ﬂat plate set normal to an oncoming
stream, α = 90◦, is frequently quoted (Birkkoﬀand Zarantonello 1957, Woods
1961), usually for the case of the Riabouchinsky model. At small cavitation
numbers (large cavities) the asymptotic form of the drag coeﬃcient, CD, is (Wu
1972)
CD(σ) =
2π
π + 4

1 + σ +
σ2
(8π + 32) + O(σ4)

(8.34)
where the value for σ = 0, namely CD = 0.88, corresponds to the original
solution of Kirchoﬀ(in that case the cavity is inﬁnitely long and the closure
model is unnecessary). A good approximation to the form of Equation (8.34)
at low σ is
CD(σ) = CD(0)[1 + σ]
(8.35)
and it transpires that this is an accurate empirical formula for a wide range of
body shapes, both planar and axisymmetric (see Brennen 1969a), provided the
detachment is of the abrupt type. Bodies with smooth detachment such as a
sphere (Brennen 1969a) are less accurately represented by Equation (8.35) (see
Figure 8.18).
Since experiments are almost always conducted in water tunnels of ﬁnite
width, 2B, another set of solutions of interest are those in which straight tun-
nel boundaries are added to the geometries of the preceding section, as shown
in Figure 8.15. In the case of symmetric wedges in tunnels, solutions for all
three closure models of Figure 8.2 were obtained by Wu et al. (1971). Drag
coeﬃcients, cavity dimensions, and pressure distributions were computed as
functions of cavitation number, σ, and blockage ratio, b/B. As illustrated in

Figure 8.15: Notation for planar ﬂow in a water tunnel.

presented as a function of cavitation number, σ, for various ratios of wedge width

model (solid lines) including the choked ﬂow conditions (dashed line with points
for various b/B indicated by arrows), for the experimental measurements (open
symbols), and for the experimental data corrected to b/B →0. Adapted from

radius, b, for various tunnel radii, B, from the numerical calculations of Brennen

some results from Rouse and McNown (1948). On the right the half-length of
the cavity, ℓ, is compared with the experimental data of Brennen (1969a) (◦)
for which B/b = 14.7.
Figure 8.16, the results compare well with experimental measurements provided
the cavitation number is low enough for a fully developed cavity to be formed
(see Section 7.8). In the case shown in Figure 8.16, this cavitation number was
about 1.5. The Riabouchinsky model results are shown in the ﬁgure since they
were marginally better than those of the other two models insofar as the drag
on the wedge was concerned. The variations with b/B shown in Figure 8.16
were discussed in Section 8.4.
For comparative purposes, some results for a cavitating sphere in an ax-
isymmetric water tunnel are presented in Figures 8.17 and 8.18. These results
were obtained by Brennen (1969a) using a numerical method (see Section 8.11).
Note that the variations with tunnel blockage are qualitatively similar to those
of planar ﬂow. However, the calculated drag coeﬃcients in Figure 8.18 are sub-
stantially larger than those experimentally measured because of the diﬀerence
in the detachment locations discussed in Section 8.3 and illustrated in Figure
8.5.
Reichardt (1945) carried out some of the earliest experimental investigations
of fully developed cavities and observed that, when the cavitation number be-
comes very small, the maximum width, 2d, and the length, 2ℓ, of the cavity in
an unconﬁned ﬂow (b/B = 0) vary roughly with σ in the following way:

LINEARIZED METHODS
When the body/cavity system is slender in the sense that the direction of the ve-
locity vector is everywhere close to that of the oncoming uniform stream (except,
perhaps, close to some singularities), then methods similar to those of thin air-
foil theory (see, for example, Biot 1942) become feasible. The approximations
involved lead to a more tractable mathematical problem and to approximate

cavity ﬂows (upper sketches): a partially cavitating foil (left) and a supercavi-
tating headform (right). Solid boundaries are indicated by the thick lines and
the free streamlines by the thick dashed lines.
solutions in circumstances in which the only alternative would be the applica-
tion of more direct numerical methods. Linear theories for cavity ﬂows were
pioneered by Tulin (1953). Though the methods have been extended to three-
dimensional ﬂows, it is convenient to begin by describing their application to
the case of an inviscid and incompressible planar ﬂow of a uniform stream of
velocity, U∞, past a single, streamlined cavitating body. It is assumed that the
body is slender and that the wetted surface is described by y = h(x) where
dh/dx ≪1. It is also assumed that the boundary conditions on the body and
the cavity can, to a ﬁrst approximation, be applied on the x-axis as shown in
Figure 8.19. The velocity components at any point are denoted by u = U∞+u′
and v where the linearization requires that both u′ and v are much smaller than
U∞. The appropriate boundary condition on the wetted surface is then
v = U∞
dh
dx
(8.38)
Moreover, the coeﬃcient of pressure anywhere in the ﬂow is given by Cp ≈
−2u′$
U∞, and therefore the boundary condition on a free streamline becomes
u′ = σU∞
$
2
(8.39)
Finally, a boundary condition at inﬁnity must also be prescribed.
In some
instances it seems appropriate to linearize about an x-axis that is parallel with
the velocity at inﬁnity. In other cases, it may be more appropriate and more
convenient to linearize about an x-axis that is parallel with a mean longitudinal
line through the body-cavity system. In the latter case the boundary condition
at inﬁnity is w(z →∞) →U∞e−iα where α is the angle of incidence of the
uniform stream relative to the body-cavity axis.
Even within the conﬁnes of this simple problem, several diﬀerent conﬁgura-
tions of wetted surface and free surface are possible, as illustrated by the two

examples in Figure 8.19. Moreover, various types of singularity can occur at the
end points of any segment of boundary in the linearized plane (points A through
G in Figure 8.19). It is important that the solution contain the correct singular
behavior at each of these points. Consider the form that the complex conjugate
perturbation velocity, w = u′ −iv, must take for each of the diﬀerent types of
singularity that can occur. Let x = c be the location of the speciﬁc singularity
under consideration. Clearly, then, a point like D, the stagnation point at a
rounded nose or leading edge, must have a solution of the form w ∼i(z −c)−1/2
(Newman 1956). On the other hand, a sharp leading edge from which a free
surface detaches (such as A) must have the form w ∼i(z −c)−1/4 (Tulin 1953).
These results are readily derived by applying the appropriate conditions of con-
stant v or constant u′ on θ = 0 and θ = 2π.
The conditions at regular detachment points such as E or F (as opposed to
the irregular combination of a detachment point and front stagnation point at
A) should follow the conditions derived earlier for detachment points (Section
8.3). If it is an abrupt detachment point, then w is continous and the singular
behavior is w ∼(z−c)1/2; on the other hand, if it is a smooth detachment point,
both w and dw/dz must be continuous and w ∼(z −c)3/2. At cavity closure
points such as B or G various models have been employed (Tulin 1964). In the
case of the supercavitating body, Tulin’s (1953) original model assumes that the
point G is a stagnation point so that the singular behavior is w ∼(z−c)1/2; this
is also the obvious choice under the conditions that u′ is constant on θ = ±π.
However, with this closure condition the circulation around the body-cavity
system can no longer be arbitrarily prescribed. Other closure conditions that
address this issue have been discussed by Fabula (1962), Woods and Buxton
(1966), Nishiyama and Ota (1971), and Furuya (1975a), among others.
In
the case of the partial cavity almost all models assume a stagnation point at
the point B so that the singular behavior is w ∼(z −c)1/2. The problem of
prescription of circulation that occurred with the supercavitation closure does
not arise in this case since the conventional, noncavitating Kutta condition can
be applied at the trailing edge, C.
The literature on linearized solutions for cavity ﬂow problems is too large
for thorough coverage in this text, but a few important milestones should be
mentioned. Tulin’s (1953) original work included the solution for a supercavitat-
ing ﬂat plate hydrofoil with a sharp leading edge. Shortly thereafter, Newman
(1956) showed how a rounded leading edge might be incorporated into the lin-
ear solution and Cohen, Sutherland, and Tu (1957) provided information on the
wall eﬀects in a tunnel of ﬁnite width. Acosta (1955) provided the ﬁrst partial
cavitation solution, speciﬁcally for a ﬂat plate hydrofoil (see below). For a more
recent treatment of supercavitating single foils, the reader is referred to Furuya
and Acosta (1973).
It is appropriate to examine the linear solution to a typical cavity ﬂow prob-
lem and, in the next section, the details for a cavitating ﬂat plate hydrofoil will
be given.
Many other types of cavitating ﬂow have been treated by linear theory,
including such problems as the eﬀect of a nearby ocean surface. An important

class of solutions is that involving cascades of foils, and these are addressed in
Section 8.9.
8.8
FLAT PLATE HYDROFOIL
The algebra associated with the linear solutions for a ﬂat plate hydrofoil is
fairly simple, so we will review and examine the results for the supercavitating
foil (Tulin 1953) and for the partially cavitating foil (Acosta 1955). Starting
with the latter, the z-plane is shown on the left in Figure 8.19, and this can be
mapped into the upper half of the ζ-plane in Figure 8.20 by
ζ = i

(8.40)
The point H∞at η = i corresponds to the point at inﬁnity in the z-plane and
the point C∞, the trailing edge of the foil, is the point at inﬁnity in the ζ-
plane. It follows that the point B, the cavity closure point, is at ξ = c where
c = (ℓ/(1 −ℓ))1/2 and ℓis the length of the cavity, AB, in the physical plane.
The chord of the hydrofoil, AC, has been set to unity. Since there must be
square-root singularities at A and B, since v is zero on the real axis in the
intervals ξ < 0 and ξ > c and u′ = σU∞/2 in 0 < ξ < c, and since w must be
everywhere bounded, the general form of the solution may be written down by
inspection:
w(ζ) = σU∞

+ U∞(C0 + C1ζ)
[ζ(ζ −c)]1/2
(8.41)
where C0 and C1 are constants to be determined. The Kutta condition at the
trailing edge, C∞, requires that the velocity be ﬁnite and continous at that
point, and this is satisﬁed provided there are no terms of order ζ2 or higher in
the series C0 + C1ζ.
The conditions that remain to be applied are those at the point of inﬁnity
in the physical plane, η = i. The nature of the solution near this point should
therefore be examined by expanding in powers of 1/z. Since ζ →i + i/2z +

O(z−2) and since we must have that w →−iαU∞, expanding Equation (8.41)
in powers of 1/z allows evaluation of the real constants, C0 and C1, in terms of
α and σ:

(8.43)
In addition, the expansion of w in powers of 1/z must satisfy Equation (8.33). If
the cavity is ﬁnite, then Q = 0 and evaluation of the real part of the coeﬃcient
of 1/z leads to

the foil to be determined. This yields the lift coeﬃcient,


(8.45)
Thus the solution has been obtained in terms of the parameter, ℓ, the ratio of
the cavity length to the chord. For a given value of ℓand a given angle of attack,
α, the corresponding cavitation number follows from Equation (8.44) and the
lift coeﬃcient from equation 8.45. Note that as ℓ→0 the value of CL tends
to the theoretical value for a noncavitating ﬂat plate, 2πα. Also note that the
lift-slope, dCL/dα, tends to inﬁnity when ℓ= 3/4.
In the supercavitating case, Tulin’s (1953) solution yields the following re-
sults in place of Equations (8.44) and (8.45):

where now, of course, ℓ> 1. Note that the lift-slope, dCL/dα, is zero at ℓ= 4/3.
The lift coeﬃcient and the cavity length from Equations (8.44) to (8.47) are
plotted against cavitation number in Figure 8.21 for a typical angle of attack of
α = 4◦. Note that as σ →∞the fully wetted lift coeﬃcient, 2πα, is recovered
from the partial cavitation solution, and that as σ →0 the lift coeﬃcient tends
to πα/2. Notice also that both the solutions become pathological when the
length of the cavity approaches the chord length (ℓ→1). However, if some
small portion of each curve close to ℓ= 1 is eliminated, then the characteristic
decline in the performance of the hydrofoil as the cavitation number is decreased
can be observed. Speciﬁcally, it is seen that the decline in the lift coeﬃcient
begins when σ falls below about 0.7 for the ﬂat plate at an angle of attack of
4◦. Close to σ = 0.7, one observes a small increase in CL before the decline
sets in, and this phenomenon is often observed in practice, as illustrated by the
experimental data of Wade and Acosta (1966) included in Figure 8.21.

Figure 8.21: Typical results from the linearized theories for a cavitating ﬂat
plate at an angle of attack of 4◦. The lift coeﬃcients, CL (solid lines), and the
ratios of cavity length to chord, ℓ(dashed lines), are from the supercavitation
theory of Tulin (1953) and the partial cavitation theory of Acosta (1955). Also
shown are the experimental results of Wade and Acosta (1966) for ℓ(△) and
for CL (◦and •) where the open symbols represent points of stable operation
and the solid symbols denote points of unstable cavity operation.
The variation in the lift with angle of attack (for a ﬁxed cavitation number)
is presented in Figure 8.22. Also shown in this ﬁgure are the lines of ℓ= 4/3 in
the supercavitation solution and ℓ= 3/4 in the partial cavitation solution. Note
that these lines separate regions for which dCL/dα > 0 from those for which
dCL/dα < 0. Heuristically it could be argued that dCL/dα < 0 implies an
unstable ﬂow and the corresponding region in ﬁgure 8.22 for which 3/4 < ℓ< 4/3
does, indeed, correspond quite closely to the observed regime of unstable cavity
oscillation (Wade and Acosta 1966).
8.9
CAVITATING CASCADES
Because cavitation problems are commonly encountered in liquid turbomachines
(pumps, turbines) and on propellers, the performance of a cascade of hydrofoils
under cavitating conditions is of considerable practical importance. A typical
cascade geometry (z-plane) is shown on the left in Figure 8.23; in the termi-
nology of these ﬂows the angle, β, is known as the “stagger angle” and 1/h,
the ratio of the blade chord to the distance between the blade tips, is known as
the “solidity.” The corresponding complex potential plane (f-plane) is shown
on the right. Note that the geometry of the linearized physical plane is very
similar to that of the f-plane.

Figure 8.22: The lift coeﬃcient for a ﬂat plate from the partial cavitation model
of Acosta (1955) (dashed lines) and the supercavitation model of Tulin (1953)
(solid lines) as a function of angle of attack, α, for several cavitation numbers,
σ, as shown. The dotted lines are the boundaries of the region in which the
cavity length is between 3/4 and 4/3 of a chord and in which dCL/dα < 0.
Figure 8.23: On the left is the physical plane (z-plane), and on the right is
the complex potential plane (f-plane) for the planar ﬂow through a cascade
of cavitating hydrofoils. The example shown is for supercavitating foils. For
partial cavitation the points D and E merge and the point C is on the upper
wetted surface of the foil. For a sharp leading edge the points A and B merge.
Figures adapted from Furuya (1975a).

Figure 8.24: The ζ-plane obtained by using the cascade mapping function.
The ﬁrst step in the analysis of the planar potential ﬂow in a cascade
(whether by linear or nonlinear methods) is to map the inﬁnite array of blades
in the f-plane (or the linearized z-plane) into a ζ-plane in which there is a
single wetted surface boundary and a single cavity surface boundary. This is
accomplished by the well-known cascade mapping function
f
or
z = h
2π
e−iβ ln(1 −ζ/ζH) + eiβ ln(1 −ζ/¯ζH)
(8.48)
where h∗(or h) is the distance between the leading edges of the blades and
β∗(or β) is the stagger angle of the cascade in the f-plane (or the linearized
z-plane). This mapping produces the ζ-plane shown in Figure 8.24 where H∞
(ζ = ζH) is the point at inﬁnity in the original plane and the angle β′ is equal
to the stagger angle in the original plane. The solution is obtained when the
mapping w(ζ) has been determined and all the boundary conditions have been
applied.
For a supercavitating cascade, a nonlinear solution was ﬁrst obtained by
Woods and Buxton (1966) for the case of a cascade of ﬂat plates.
Furuya
(1975a) expanded this work to include foils of arbitrary geometry. An interesting
innovation introduced by Woods and Buxton was the use of Tulin’s (1964)
double-spiral-vortex model for cavity closure, but with the additional condition
that the diﬀerence in the velocity potentials at the points C and D (Figure 8.23)
should be equal to the circulation around the foil.
Linear theories for a cascade began much earlier with the work of Betz
and Petersohn (1931), who solved the problem of inﬁnitely long, open cavities
produced by a cascade of ﬂat plate hydrofoils. Sutherland and Cohen (1958)
generalized this to the case of ﬁnite supercavities behind a ﬂat plate cascade,
and Acosta (1960) solved the same problem but with a cascade of circular-arc
hydrofoils. Other early contributions to linear cascade theory for supercavitat-
ing foils include the models of Duller (1966) and Hsu (1972) and the inclusion
of the eﬀect of rounded leading edges by Furuya (1974).
Cavities initiated at the leading edge are more likely to extend beyond the
trailing edge when the solidity and the stagger angle are small. Such cascade
geometries are more characteristic of propellers and, therefore, the supercavitat-
ing cascade results are more often utilized in that context. On the other hand,

solution of partial cavitation in an inﬁnitely long cascade of ﬂat plates (Acosta
and Hollander 1959). The points E∞and H∞are respectively the points at
upstream and downstream inﬁnity in the z-plane.
most cavitating pumps have larger solidities (> 1) and large stagger angles.
Consequently, partial cavitation is the more characteristic condition in pumps,
particularly since the pressure rise through the pump is likely to collapse the
cavity before it emerges from the blade passage. Partially cavitating cascade
analysis began with the work of Acosta and Hollander (1959), who obtained the
linear solution for a cascade of inﬁnitely long ﬂat plates, the geometry of which
is shown in Figure 8.25. The appropriate cascade mapping is then the version
of Equation (8.48) with z on the left-hand side.
The Acosta and Hollander
solution is algebraically simple and therefore makes a good, speciﬁc example.
The length of the cavity in the ζ-plane, a, provides a convenient parameter for
the problem and should not be confused with the actual cavity length, ℓ. Given
the square-root singularities at A and C, the complex velocity, w(ζ), takes the
form

Wade (1967) extended this partial cavitation analysis to cover ﬂat plate foils of
ﬁnite length, and Stripling and Acosta (1962) considered the nonlinear problem.
Brennen and Acosta (1973) presented a simple, approximate method by which
a ﬁnite blade thickness can be incorporated into the analysis of Acosta and
Hollander. This is particularly valuable because the choked cavitation number,
σc, is quite sensitive to the blade thickness or radius of curvature of the leading
edge.

analysis:

where d is the ratio of the blade thickness to normal blade spacing, h cos β, far
downstream. Since the validity of the linear theory requires that α ≪1 and
since many pumps (for example, cavitating inducers) have stagger angles close
to π/2, a reasonable approximation to Equation (8.53) is
σc ≈α(θ −α) + θ2d
(8.54)
where θ = π/2−β. This limit is often used to estimate the breakdown cavitation
number for a pump based on the heuristic argument that long partial cavities
that reach the pump discharge would permit substantial deviation angles and
therefore lead to a marked decline in pump performance (Brennen and Acosta
1973).
Note, however, that under the conditions of an inviscid model, a small par-
tial cavity will not signiﬁcantly alter the performance of the cascade of higher
solidity (say, 1/h > 1) since the discharge, with or without the cavity, is essen-
tially constrained to follow the direction of the blades. On the other hand, the
direction of ﬂow downstream of a supercavitating cascade will be signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the cavities, and the corresponding lift and drag coeﬃcients will be
altered by the cavitation. We return to the subject of supercavitating cascades
to demonstrate this eﬀect.
A substantial body of data on the performance of cavitating cascades has
been accumulated through the eﬀorts of Numachi (1961, 1964), Wade and
Acosta (1967), and others. This allows comparison with the analytical models,
in particular the supercavitating theories. Figure 8.26 provides such a compari-
son between measured lift and drag coeﬃcients (deﬁned as normal and parallel
to the direction of the incident stream) for a particular cascade and the theo-
retical results from the supercavitating theories of Furuya (1975a) and Duller
(1966). Note that the measured lift coeﬃcients exhibit a rapid decline in cas-
cade performance as the cavitation number is reduced and the supercavities
grow. However, it is important to observe that this degradation does not oc-
cur until the cavitation is quite extensive. The cavitation inception numbers
for the experiments were σi = 2.35 (for 8◦) and σi = 1.77 (for 9◦). However,

the cavitation number must be lowered to about 0.5 before the performance is
adversely aﬀected. In the range of σ in between are the partial cavitation states
for which the performance is little changed.
For the cascades and incidence angles used in the example of Figure 8.26,
Furuya (1975a) shows that the linear and nonlinear supercavitation theories
yield results that are similar and close to those of the experiments.
This is
illustrated in Figure 8.26. However, Furuya also demonstrates that there are
circumstances in which the linear theories can be substantially in error and for
which the nonlinear results are clearly needed. The eﬀect of the solidity, 1/h, on
the results is also important because it is a major design factor in determining
the number of blades in a pump or propeller. Figure 8.27 illustrates the eﬀect of
solidity when large supercavities are present (σ = 0.18). Note that the solidity
has remarkably little eﬀect.

and Acosta (1967), and the analytical results for a supercavitating cascade are

8.10
THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOWS
Though numerical methods seem to be in the ascendant, several eﬀorts have
been made to treat three-dimensional cavity ﬂows analytically. Early analyses
of attached cavities on ﬁnite aspect ratio foils combined the solutions for planar
ﬂows with the corrections known from ﬁnite aspect ratio aerodynamics (Johnson
1961). Later, stripwise solutions for cavitating foils of ﬁnite span were devel-
oped in which an inner solution from either a linear or a nonlinear theory was
matched to an outer solution from lifting line theory. This approach was used by
Nishiyama (1970), Leehey (1971), and Furuya (1975b) to treat supercavitating
foils and by Uhlman (1978) for partially cavitating foils. Widnall (1966) used a
lifting surface method in a three-dimensional analysis of supercavitating foils.
For more slender bodies such as delta wings, the linearized procedure out-
lined in Section 8.7 can be extended to three-dimensional bodies in much the
same way as it is applied in the slender body theories of aerodynamics. Tulin
(1959) and Cumberbatch and Wu (1961) used this approach to model cavitating
delta wings.
8.11
NUMERICAL METHODS
With the modern evolution of computational methods it has become increasingly
viable to consider more direct numerical methods for the solution of free surface
ﬂows, even in circumstances in which analytical solutions could be generated. It
would be beyond the scope of this text to survey these computational methods,
and so we conﬁne our discussion to some brief comments on the methods used

in the past. These can be conveniently divided into two types. Some of the
literature describes “ﬁeld” methods in which the entire ﬂow ﬁeld is covered by
a lattice of grids and node points at which the ﬂow variables are evaluated.
But most of the work in the past has focused on the use of “boundary element”
methods that make use of superposition of the fundamental singularity solutions
for potential ﬂows. A few methods do not ﬁt into these categories; for example,
the expansion technique devised by Garabedian (1956) in order to construct
axisymmetric ﬂow solutions from the corresponding planar ﬂows.
Methods for the synthesis of potential ﬂows using distributed singularities
can, of course, be traced to the original work of Rankine (1871). The ﬁrst at-
tempts to use distributions of sources and sinks to ﬁnd solutions to axisymmet-
ric cavity ﬂow problems appear to have been made by Reichardt and Munzner
(1950). They distributed doublets on the axis and sought symmetric, Rankine-
like body shapes with nearly constant surface pressure except for fore and aft
caps in order to simulate Riabouchinsky ﬂows. The problem with this approach
is its inability to model the discontinuous or singular behavior at the free surface
detachment points. This requires a distribution of surface singularities that can
either be implemented explicitly (most conveniently with surface vortex sheet
elements) or by the equivalent use of Green’s function methods as pioneered
by Treﬀtz (1916) in the context of jets. Distributions of surface singularities to
model cavity ﬂows were ﬁrst employed by Landweber (1951), Armstrong and
Dunham (1953), and Armstrong and Tadman (1954). The latter used these
methods to generate solutions for the axisymmetric Riabouchinsky solutions
of cavitating discs and spheres.
The methods were later extended to three-
dimensional potential ﬂows by Struck (1966), who addressed the problem of an
axisymmetric body at a small angle of attack to the oncoming stream.
As computational capacity grew, it became possible to examine more com-
plex three-dimensional ﬂows and lifting bodies using boundary element methods.
For example, Lemonnier and Rowe (1988) computed solutions for a partially
cavitating hydrofoil and Uhlman (1987, 1989) has generated solutions for hy-
drofoils with both partial cavitation and supercavitation. These methods solve
for the velocity. The position of the cavity boundary is determined by an it-
erative process in which the dynamic condition is satisﬁed on an approximate
cavity surface and the kinematic condition is used to update the location of the
surface. More recently, a method that uses Green’s theorem to solve for the
potential has been developed by Kinnas and Fine (1990) and has been applied
to both partially and supercavitating hydrofoils. This appears to be superior to
the velocity-based methods in terms of convergence.
Eﬀorts have also been made to develop “ﬁeld” methods for cavity ﬂows.
Southwell and Vaisey (1946) (see also Southwell 1948) ﬁrst explored the use of
relaxation methods to solve free surface problems but did not produce solutions
for any realistic cavity ﬂows. Woods (1951) suggested that solutions to axisym-
metric cavity ﬂows could be more readily obtained in the geometrically simpler
(φ, ψ) plane, and Brennen (1969a) used this suggestion to generate Riabouch-
insky model solutions for a cavitating disc and sphere in a ﬁnite water tunnel
(see Figures 8.5, 8.17 and 8.18). In more recent times, it has become clear that

boundary integral methods are more eﬃcient for potential ﬂows. However, ﬁeld
methods must still be used when seeking solutions to the more complete vis-
cous ﬂow problem. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the last few years in
developing Navier-Stokes solvers for free surface problems in general and cavity
ﬂow problems in particular (see, for example, Deshpande et al. 1993).
8.12
UNSTEADY FLOWS
Most of the analyses in the preceding sections addressed various steady free
streamline ﬂows. The corresponding unsteady ﬂows pose more formidable mod-
eling problems, and it is therefore not surprising that progress in solving these
unsteady ﬂows has been quite limited. Though Wang and Wu (1965) show how
a general perturbation theory of cavity ﬂows may be formulated, the implemen-
tation of their methodology to all but the simplest ﬂows may be prohibitively
complicated. Moreover, there remains much uncertainity regarding the appro-
priate closure model to use in unsteady ﬂow. Consequently, the case of zero
cavitation number raises less uncertainty since it involves an inﬁnitely long cav-
ity and no closure. We will therefore concentrate on the linear solution of the
problem of small amplitude perturbations to a mean ﬂow with zero cavitation
number. This problem was ﬁrst solved by Woods (1957) in the context of an os-
cillating aerofoil with separated ﬂow but can be more conﬁdently applied to the
cavity ﬂow problem. Martin (1962) and Parkin (1962) further reﬁned Woods’
theory and provided tabulated data for the unsteady force coeﬃcients, which
we will utilize in this summary.
The unsteady ﬂow problem is best posed using the “acceleration potential”
(see, for example, Biot 1942), denoted here by φ′ and deﬁned simply as (p∞−
p)/ρ, so that linearized versions of Euler’s equations of motion may be written
as
∂φ′
∂x = ∂u
∂t + U∞
∂u
∂x
(8.55)
∂φ′
∂y = ∂v
∂t + U∞
∂v
∂x
(8.56)
It follows from the equation of continuity that φ′ satisﬁes Laplace’s equation,
∇2φ′ = 0
(8.57)
Now consider the boundary conditions on the cavity and on the wetted surface
of a ﬂat plate foil. Since the cavity pressure at zero cavitation number is equal
to p∞, it follows that the boundary condition on a free surface is φ′ = 0.
The linearized condition on a wetted surface (the unsteady version of Equation
(8.38)) is clearly
v = −αU∞−∂h
∂t
(8.58)
where y = −h(x, t) describes the geometry of the wetted surface, α is the angle
of incidence, and the chord of the foil is taken to be unity.
We consider a

coeﬃcients for a ﬂat plate hydrofoil at zero cavitation number.
ﬂat plate at a mean angle of incidence of ¯α that is undergoing small-amplitude
oscillations in both heave and pitch at a frequency, ω. The amplitude and phase
of the pitching oscillations are incorporated in the complex quantity, ˜α, so that
the instantaneous angle of incidence is given by
α = ¯α + Re ˜αejωt
(8.59)
and the amplitude and phase of the heave oscillations of the leading edge are
incorporated in the complex quantity ˜h (positive in the negative y direction) so
that
h(x, t) = Re

˜hejωt
+ xRe

˜αejωt
(8.60)
where the origin of x is taken to be the leading edge. Combining Equations
(8.56), (8.58), and (8.60), the boundary condition on the wetted surface becomes
∂φ′
∂y = Re

(ω2˜h + ω2 ˜αx −2jωU∞˜α)ejωt
(8.61)
Consequently, the problem reduces to solving for the analytic function φ′(z)
subject to the conditions that φ′ is zero on a free streamline and that, on
a wetted surface, ∂φ′$∂y is a known, linear function of x given by Equation
(8.61).

In the linearized form this mathematical problem is quite similar to that of
the steady ﬂow for a cavitating foil at an angle of attack and can be solved by
similar methods (Woods 1957, Martin 1962). The resulting instantaneous lift
and moment coeﬃcients can be decomposed into components due to the pitch
and the heave:
CL = ¯CL + Re

(˜h ˜CLh + ˜α ˜CLp)ejωt
(8.62)
CM = ¯CM + Re

(˜h ˜CMh + ˜α ˜CMp)ejωt
(8.63)
where the moment about the leading edge is considered positive in the clockwise
direction (tending to increase α). The four complex coeﬃcients, ˜CLh, ˜CLp, ˜CMh,
and ˜CMp, represent the important dynamic characteristics of the foil and are
functions of the reduced frequency deﬁned as ω∗= ωc/U∞where c is the chord.
The tabulations by Parkin (1962) allow evaluation of these coeﬃcients, and
they are presented in Figure 8.28 as functions of the reduced frequency. The
values tabulated by Woods (1957) yield very similar results. Note that when
the reduced frequency is much less than unity, the coeﬃcients tend to their
quasistatic values; in this limit all but Re{ ˜CLp} and Re{ ˜CMp} tend to zero,
and these two nonzero coeﬃcients tend to the quasistatic values of dCL/dα and
dCM/dα, namely π/2 and 5π/32, respectively.
Acosta and DeLong (1971) measured the oscillating forces on a cavitating
hydrofoil subjected to heave oscillations at various reduced frequencies. Their
results both for cavitating and noncavitating ﬂow are presented in Figure 8.29
for several mean angles of incidence, ¯α. The analytical results from ﬁgure 8.28
are included in this ﬁgure and compare fairly well with the experiments. Indeed,
the agreement is better than is manifest between theory and experiment in
the noncavitating case, perhaps because the oscillations of the pressure in the
separated region or wake of the noncavitating ﬂow are not adequately modeled.
Other advances in the treatment of unsteady linearized cavity ﬂows were
introduced by Wu (1957) and Timman (1958), and the original work of Woods
was extended to ﬁnite cavitation numbers (ﬁnite cavities) by Kelly (1967), who
found that the qualitative nature of the results was not dependent on σ. Later,
Widnall (1966) showed how the linearized acceleration potential methods could
be implemented in three dimensions. Another valuable extension would be to
a cascade of foils, but the author is unaware of any similar unsteady data for
cavitating cascades.
Indeed, apart from the work of Sisto (1967), very little
analytical work has been done on the problem of the unsteady response of
separated ﬂow in a cascade, a problem that is of considerable importance in the
context of turbomachinery. Though progress has been made in understanding
the “dynamic stall” of a single foil (see, for example, Ham 1968), there seems
to be a clear need for further research on the unsteady behavior of separated
and cavitating ﬂows in cascades.
The unsteady lift and moment coeﬃcients
are not only valuable in determining the unsteady characteristics of propulsion
and lift systems but have also been used to predict the ﬂutter and divergence
characteristics of cavitating foils (for example, Brennen et al. 1980).

symbols) and for cavitating ﬂow for a mean incidence of 8◦, for very long choked
cavities (2) and for cavities 3 chords in length (3). Adapted from Acosta and
