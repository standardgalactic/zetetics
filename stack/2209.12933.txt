INTEGRALS DETECTING DEGREE 3 STRING COBORDISM
CLASSES
DOMENICO FIORENZA AND EUGENIO LANDI
Abstract. The third string bordism group is known to be Z{24Z. Using Wal-
dorf’s notion of a geometric string structure on a manifold, Bunke–Naumann and
Redden have exhibited integral formulas involving the Chern-Weil form represen-
tative of the ﬁrst Pontryagin class and the canonical 3-form of a geometric string
structure that realize the isomorphism BordString
3
Ñ Z{24Z (these formulas have
been recently rediscovered by Gaiotto–Johnson-Freyd–Witten). We will show how
these formulas naturally emerge when one considers certain natural Up1q-valued
and R-valued 3d TQFT associated with the classifying stacks of Spin bundles with
connection and of String bundles with geometric structure, respectively.
1. Introduction
It is not hard to show that in degree n less or equal to 6 the String bordism group,
BordString
n
is isomorphic to the framed bordism group Bordfr
n. Indeed, BString “
BOx8y is the eighth stage in the Whitehead tower of the classifying space of or-
thogonal group and so the obstructions to lifting the classifying map of the tangent
bundle of an n-dimensional string manifold M through all the higher stages of the
tower lie in the cohomology groups HkpM; πkBOq for k ě 8. In particular, all of
these obstructions vanish if n ď 7. By the celebrated Pontryagin-Thom isomorphism
one has Bordfr
n – πnpSq, where S is the sphere spectrum or, equivalently, that Bordfr
n
is isomorphic to the n-th stable homotopy group of the spheres. All this together,
for n “ 3, gives
BordString
3
– Bordfr
3 – π3pSq – Z{24Z
One may wish to express the isomorphism ϕ: BordString
3
–ÝÑ Z{24Z as some charac-
teristic number given by integrating some canonical diﬀerential 3-form on a closed
string 3-manifold M: ϕrMs “
ş
M ωM. Clearly, there is no hope that this can be
true, since the integral takes real values while ϕ takes values in Z{24Z, and there
is no injective group homomorphism from Z{24Z to R. There is however a variant
of this construction that may work. Instead of considering just a string 3-manifold
M, one considers a string 3-manifold M endowed with some additional structure Υ.
This structure should be such that any M admits at least one Υ. To the pair pM, Υq
there could be associated canonical 3-form ωM,Υ such that
ş
M ωM,Υ takes integral
values. Then, if a change in the additional structure Υ results in a change in the
value
ş
M ωM,Υ by a multiple of 24 one would have a well deﬁned element

in Z{24Z, depending only on the string 3-manifold M; and this could indeed rep-
resent the isomorphism ϕ. In this form the statement is indeed almost true. The
correct version of it has been found by Bunke and Naumann [BN14] and, indepen-
dently, by Redden [Red11]. Their additional datum Υ consists of a triple pη, W, ∇q,
where η is a geometric string structure on M in the sense of Waldorf [Wal13], W is
a spin 4-manifold with BW “ M,1 and ∇is a spin connection on W such that the
restriction ∇
ˇˇ
M coincides with the spin connection datum of the geometric string
structure η. Out of the data pM, η, W, ∇q one can compute
ψpM, η, W, ∇q :“ 1

ωη,
where pCW
1
p∇q is the Chern-Weil 4-form for the ﬁrst Pontryagin class, evaluated
on the connection ∇, and ωη is the canonical 3-form associated with the geometric
string structure η.2
From the interplay between geometric string structures and
diﬀerential cohomology it follows that ψpM, η, W, ∇q P Z. Keeping pM, ηq ﬁxed and
letting pW, ∇q vary, one ﬁnds
ψpM, η, W1, ∇1q ´ ψpM, η, W0, ∇0q “ 1

W

where W “ W1YM W opp

denotes the closed spin 4-manifold obtained gluing together
W0 (with the opposite orientation) and W1 along M, and 1
2p1pWq P H4pW; Zq is the
ﬁrst fractional Pontryagin class of W. One has
ˆApWq “ ´ 1
24
ż
W
p1pWq
for any closed oriented 4-manifold W. By the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the ˆA-
genus of a closed oriented manifold is an integer if the manifold is spin, and is an even
integer if moreover the dimension of the manifold is of the form 8k ` 4. Therefore
in our case we have that
ş
W p1pWq P 48Z and so
ş
W
1
2p1pWq P 24Z. Therefore the
function
ψpM, ηq :“ ψpM, η, W, ∇q
mod 24
is well deﬁned.
One concludes by showing that ψpM, ηq is actually independent
of the geometric string structure η, and only depending on the string cobordism
class of M. Additivity is manifest from the deﬁnition, so the above integral formula
deﬁnes a group homomorphism ψ: BordString
3
–ÝÑ Z{24Z. A direct computation with
the canonical generator of BordString
3
, i.e., with S3 endowed with the trivialization
of its tangent bundle coming from S3 – SUp2q, then shows that ψ is indeed an
isomorphism.
The aim of this note is to show how the above integral formula for ψ, as well as its
main properties, naturally emerge in the context of topological ﬁeld theories with
values in the symmetric monoidal categories associated with morphisms of abelian
groups.
1Such a W surely exists, since BordSpin

2This expression has been recently considered by Gaiotto–Johnson-Freyd–Witten in the context
of minimally supersymmetric models in two dimensions [GJFW19].

2. Symmetric monoidal categories from morphisms of abelian groups
and TQFTs
By Bordξ
d,d´1pXq we will denote the symmetric monoidal category of pd, d ´ 1q-
bordism with tangential structure ξ and background ﬁelds X. Contenting us with
an informal deﬁnition,3 this we mean that the objects of Bordξ
d,d´1pXq are pd ´ 1q-
dimensional closed manifolds M equipped with a certain reduction ξ of the structure
group of the “d-stabilized” tangent bundle TM‘R, and a map f : M Ñ X to a space,
or more generally smooth stack, of background ﬁelds X. Morphisms W : M0 Ñ M1
in Bordξ
d,d´1pXq are d-manifolds with a ξ-structure on the tangent bundle and map
to X such that BW “ M0
š M1 and such that the restrictions of the tangential
structure and of the map to the target of W coincide “up to a sign” with those of the
Mi’s. The only tangential structures we will be concerned with will be orientations,
spin, and string structures; we will denote them by or, Spin, and String, respectively.
The monoidal structure on Bordξ
d,d´1pXq is given by disjoint union.
Remark 2.1. The trivial bundle R will always be oriented with t1u as a positively
oriented basis. This way the datum of a d-stable orientation on pd ´ 1q-manifold M
reduces to the datum of an orientation of M.
Example 2.2. Let X “ Ωd´1
cl
be the smooth stack of closed pd ´ 1q-forms. Then an
object of Bordor
d,d´1pΩd´1
cl q is given by a closed oriented pd´1q-manifold M equipped
with an (automatically closed) pd ´ 1q-form ωd´1;M. A morphism W : M0 Ñ M1 in
Bordor
d,d´1pΩd´1
cl q is the datum of an oriented d-manifold W with BW “ M1
š Mopp

where “opp” denotes the opposite orientation, equipped with a closed pd ´ 1q-form
ωd´1;W such that
ωd´1;W
ˇˇ
Mi “ ωd´1;Mi
for i “ 0, 1.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let C be a symmetric monoidal category. A pd, d´1q-dimensional C-
valued topological quantum ﬁeld theory (TQFT for short) with tangential structure
ξ and background ﬁelds X is a symmetric monoidal functor
Z : Bordξ
d,d´1pXq Ñ C.
A typical target is C “ Vect, the category of vector spaces (over some ﬁxed
ﬁeld K). In this case the functor Z maps the pd ´ 1q-manifold M (with tangential
structure and background ﬁelds) to a vector space VM and the d-manifold W to a
liner map ϕW : VM0 Ñ VM1. Equivalently, if W is a d-manifold with BW “ M, then
ZpWq is an element of VM.4 This example is so typical5 that when one speaks of a
TQFT without specifying the target C one means C “ Vect. Yet there are plenty of
3See, e.g., [Lur09, GP21] for for a rigorous deﬁnition, and, e.g., [Sch13] for an introduction to
smooth stacks in the context of ﬁeld theories.
4this corresponds to thinking of all of the boundary of W as “outgoing” so that W0 “ H, and
to identifying elements of VM with linear maps K Ñ VM by means of the distinguished basis t1u
of K.
5It is the original Atiyah’s deﬁnition [Ati88]

DOMENICO FIORENZA AND EUGENIO LANDI
interesting targets other than Vect. Here we will be concerned with the symmetric
monoidal categories naturally associated with abelian groups and with morphisms
of abelian groups.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let pA, `q be an abelian group.6 By Ab we will denote the sym-
metric monoidal category with
ObpAbq “ A;
HomAbpa, bq “
#
ida
if a “ b
H
otherwise
The tensor product is given by the sum (or multiplication) in A and the unit object
is the zero (or the unit) of A. Associators, unitors and braidings are the trivial ones.
Remark 2.5. Notice that Ab is a rigid monoidal category: the dual of an object a is
given by the opposite element ´a (or the inverse element a´1q.
Spelling out Deﬁnition 2.3 for C “ Ab we see that a TQFT with tangential
structure ξ and background ﬁelds X with values in Ab consists into a rule that
associates with any closed pd ´ 1q-manifold Md´1 (with tangential structure and
background ﬁelds) an element ZpMd´1q P A in such a way that:
‚ ZpMd´1 \ M1
d´1q “ ZpMd´1q ` ZpM1
d´1q (monoidality);
‚ if Md´1 “ BWd then ZpMd´1q “ 0 (functoriality).
Example 2.6 (Stokes’ theorem for closed forms). A paradigmatic example of a TQFT
with values in an abelian group is provided by Stokes’ theorem. Take the stack X of
background ﬁelds to be the smooth stack Ωd´1
cl
of closed pd´1q-forms as in Example
2.2, and let Rb be the symmetric monoidal category associated with the abelian
group pR, `q. Then
Z : Bordor

M ωm `
ş
M1 ωM1 is given
by the additivity of the integral, and functoriality is precisely Stokes’ theorem: if
Md´1 “ BWd and ωd´1 is the restriction to Md´1 of a closed pd ´ 1q-form on Wd
(that we will denote by the same symbol ωd´1), we have
ZpMd´1, ωd´1q “

Remark 2.7. Chern-Weil theory provides diﬀerential form representatives for Pon-
tryagin classes. These representatives can be seen as morphisms of smooth stacks
pCW

We have an induced symmetric monoidal morphism

If one keeps the principal bundle P ﬁxed and changes the so-connection ∇into a

TQFT descends to a TQFT with background ﬁelds BSO, i.e., we have a commutative
diagram

4k`1,4kpBSOq
The (p4k ` 1q-stabilized) tangent bundle provides a symmetric monoidal section to
the forgetful morphism Bordor
4k`1,4kpBSOq Ñ Bordor
4k`1,4k, so we get an absolute (i.e.,
with trivial background) oriented TQFT

pkpTMq.
The same argument applies replacing the single Pontryagin class pk with a poly-
nomial Φ “ Φpp1, p2, . . . q in the Pontryagin classes. This way one obtains plenty
of R-valued oriented TQFTs. These are in particular R-valued oriented cobordism
invariants, and Thom’s isomorphism
ΩSO
‚
b R – Rrp1, p2, . . . s
implies that indeed every R-valued oriented cobordism invariant is of this form.
More generally, one can associate a symmetric monoidal category with a morphism
of abelian groups, as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.8. Let ϕA : Amor Ñ Aob be a morphism of abelian groups. By ϕb
A we
will denote the symmetric monoidal category with
Obpϕb
Aq “ Aob;
Homϕb
Apa, bq “ tx P Amor : a ` ϕApxq “ bu.
The composition of morphism is given by the sum in Amor. The tensor product of
objects and morphisms is given by the sum in Aob and in Amor, respectively. The
unit object is the zero in Aob. Associators, unitors and braidings are the trivial ones,
i.e., they are given by the zero in Amor.

DOMENICO FIORENZA AND EUGENIO LANDI
Remark 2.9. It is easy to see that Deﬁnition 2.8 is indeed a generalization of Deﬁni-
tion 2.4: if ιA : 0 Ñ A denotes the initial morphism for A, then one has an evident
isomorphism ιb
A – Ab.
As we did for TQFTs with values in Ab, we can spell out the data of a TQFT (with
tangential structure ξ and background ﬁelds X) with values in ϕb
A. It consists into a
rule that associates with any closed pd´1q-manifold Md´1 (with tangential structure
and background ﬁelds) an element ZpMd´1q P Aob, and with any d-manifold Wd
(with tangential structure and background ﬁelds) an element ZpWdq P Amor in such
a way that:
‚ ZpMd´1 \ M1
d´1q “ ZpMd´1q ` ZpM1
d´1q and ZpWd \ W 1
dq “ ZpWdq ` ZpW 1
dq
(monoidality);
‚ if Md´1 “ BWd then ZpMd´1q “ ϕA pZpWdqq (functoriality).
The following example is the immediate generalization of Example 2.6.
Example 2.10 (Stokes’ theorem). Take as stack of background ﬁelds the smooth
stack Ωd´1 of smooth pd ´ 1q-forms. Then we have a TQFT
Z : Bordor

R
pMd´1, ωd´1q ÞÑ
ż
Md´1
ωd´1
pWd, ωd´1q ÞÑ

dωd´1.
As in Example 2.6, monoidality is given by the additivity of the integral and functo-
riality is given by Stokes’ theorem: if Md´1 “ BWd, ωd´1 is the restriction to Md´1
of a pd ´ 1q-form on Wd (that we will denote by the same symbol ωd´1), then we
have

Example 2.11 (Holonomy and curvature). A generalization of the above Example for
d “ 2 is obtained by taking X “ BUp1q∇, the stack of principal Up1q-bundles with
connection. As target we take the symmetric monoidal category associated with the
exponential morphism
expp2πi´q: R Ñ Up1q.
There’s a natural TQFT produced by these data and given by
Z : Bordor

pW2, P, ∇q ÞÑ

where holM1p∇q is the holonomy of the connection ∇along the closed oriented 1-
manifold M1 (i.e., the usual holonomy along a copy of S1, extended monoidally using

the fact that M1 is a disjoint union of ﬁnitely many copies of S1), and F∇is the
curvature 2-form of ∇. The fact that Z is a TQFT is encoded in the fundamental
integral identity relating holonomy along the boundary and curvature in the interior:

Remark 2.12. The stack BUp1q∇can be seen as the stack associated by the Dold-Kan
correspondence with the chain complex of sheaves
C8p´; Up1qq

2πidlog
ÝÝÝÝÑ Ω1p´q,
with C8p´; Up1qq in degree 1. This precisely encodes the fact that the local data for
a principal Up1q-bundle with connection pP, ∇q over smooth manifold M endowed
with an open cover U “ tUαuα P I are given by
‚ smooth maps gαβ : Uαβ Ñ Up1q
‚ 1-forms Aα on Uα
such that
‚ gαβgβγgγα “ 1 on Uαβγ;
‚ Aβ ´ Aα “

If M is a smooth manifold, the set of homotopy classes of maps from M to BUp1q∇
classiﬁes the isomorphism classes of principal Up1q-bundles with connection over M,
so that
rM, BUp1q∇s – ˆH2pM; Zq,
where ˆHnp´; Zq denotes degree n ordinary diﬀerential cohomology (or Deligne co-
homology), see, e.g., [Bry93,FSS12]. In terms of the Dold-Kan correspondence, this
reduces to the usual deﬁnition of ordinary diﬀerential cohomology as an hypercoho-
mology:
ˆHnpM; Zq – HnpM; C8p´; Up1qq Ñ Ω1q – HnpM; Z Ñ Ω0 Ñ Ω1q.

is the one that directly encodes the naive idea of an ordinary diﬀerential cohomology
class as the datum of integral cohomology class together with a closed diﬀerential
form representing it, see, e.g., [Bun12, Proposition 3.24].

Example 2.16 (TQFTs from spin connections). Let BSpin “ lim
ÝÑ BSpinpnq be the
classifying space for the inﬁnite spin group. One has H4pBSpin; Zq – Z, with a
generator given by the ﬁrst fractional Pontryagin class 1
2p1. This can equivalently
be seen as a map (well deﬁned up to homotopy)
1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ KpZ, 4q. Also
the Eilenberg-MacLane space KpZ, 4q can be seen as a classifying space: one has
KpZ, 4q – B3Up1q, i.e., KpZ, 4q is the classifying space for Up1q-principal 3-bundles.
Brylinksi and McLaughlin show in [BM94] how one can construct a ˇCech cocycle
representative for 1
2p1 starting from a ˇCech cocycle representative for a principal
Spin bundle. This construction can be reinterpreted as a reﬁnement of the map of
classifying spaces 1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ B3Up1q to a morphism of smooth stacks
1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ B3Up1q

on a principal Spin bundle one can construct a Deligne cocycle representative for
an ordinary diﬀerential cohomology class 1
2 ˆp1 lifting 1
2p1 to diﬀerential cohomology.
This too admits a natural interpretation in terms of smooth stacks: it is a lifting
of 1
2p1 to a morphism of smooth stacks 1

3. Geometric string structures
In this Section we recall Waldorf’s notion of a geometric string structure [Wal13].
We present it by using the language of smooth stacks. Doing this, on the one hand
the presentation is extremely fast, and on the other hand all the main features of
geometric string structures are very easily derived.
To begin with, recall that the classifying space of the string group is given, essen-
tially by deﬁnition, by the homotopy ﬁber of the ﬁrst fractional Pontryagin class.
In other words BString is deﬁned as the homotopy ﬁber product
BString
˚
BSpin
KpZ, 4q
1
2p1
.
We have already remarked that KpZ, 4q – B3Up1q, so that BString is equivalently
deﬁned as the homotopy ﬁber of 1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ B3Up1q. We have also recalled that,
seen this way, the ﬁrst fractional Pontryagin class can be reﬁned to a morphism of
smooth stacks 1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ B3Up1q. This naturally leads to deﬁning the smooth
stack of principal string bundles as the homotopy pullback
BString
˚
BSpin
B3Up1q
1
2p1
.
Explicitly, this means that a principal string bundle over a manifold M is the da-
tum of principal spin bundle P over M together with the choice of a trivialization
of the associated principal Up1q-3-bundle. Notice that this contains both a topolog-
ical condition (the Up1q-3-bundle has to be trivializable, and this is equivalent to
1
2p1pPq “ 0 P H4pM; Zq) and additional structure (the choice of a trivialization).
We also noticed that the morphism of stacks 1
2p1 : BSpin Ñ B3Up1q admits a
reﬁnement to a morphism of stacks 1
2 ˆp1 : BSpin∇Ñ B3Up1q∇, and this leads to
deﬁning the stack of principal string connections as the homotopy pullback
BString∇
˚
BSpin∇
B3Up1q∇
1
2 ˆp1
.
Yet, it is not BString∇the stack we are interested here, but a variant of it that
has a “more topological” nature as we are going to explain in Proposition 3.8 and
in Remark 3.9. To begin with, notice that the sequence of forgetful morphisms of

hand, a map M Ñ BStringp0q
∇consists in the datum of a principal spin connection
on M together with a trivialization of the associated Up1q-3-bundle, entirely for-
getting the connection data. A geometric string structure on M lies between these
two extremes: it consists into a principal spin connection on M together with a
trivialization of part of the data of the associated Up1q-3-connection.

Proposition 3.8. Let M be a smooth manifold, and let P : M Ñ BSpin be a
principal spin bundle on M. Then P can be enhanced to a geometric string structure
on M if and only if 1
2p1pPq “ 0.
Proof. By Lemma 3.6 and Lemma 3.7, a lift of P to a geometric string structure
induces in particular a lift of P to a string bundle, i.e., to a morphism ˜P : M Ñ
BString. By deﬁnition of BString this is equivalent to a trivialization of 1
2p1pPq,
and so implies 1
2p1pPq “ 0 in H4pM; Zq. Vice versa, if 1
2p1pPq “ 0 in H4pM; Zq then
1
2p1pPq is homotopically trivial in rM, B3Up1qs. Since every spin bundle admits a
spin connection, we can lift P to a principal string connection pP, ∇q: M Ñ BSpin∇.
By Remark 3.4, we have 1
2pp0q
1 pP, ∇q » 1
2p1pPq, and so 1
2pp0q
1 pP, ∇q is homotopically
trivial in rM, B3Up1qs. By Deﬁnition 3.1 this means that pP, ∇q can be lifted to
a morphism ηp0q : M Ñ BStringp0q
∇.
From the proof of Lemma 3.6 we see that
the obstruction to lifting ηp0q to a morphism ηp1q : M Ñ BStringp1q
∇is given by an
element in rM, B2Ω1s – H2pM, Ω1q “ 0, where the latter equality follows from
the fact that Ω1 is a ﬁne sheaf on M. Similarly, the obstruction to lifting ηp1q to a
morphism ηp2q : M Ñ BStringp2q
∇is given by an element in rM, BΩ2s – H1pM, Ω2q “

0. Therefore we see there is no obstruction to enhancing P to a geometric string
structure.
□
Remark 3.9. Since H0pM, Ω3q “ Ω3pMq is nonzero, the argument in the proof of
Proposition 3.8 can’t be used to show that a string bundle on M always admit
a string connection.
At the same time, it does not really prevents such a con-
nection to exist: the argument shows that for a particular choice of a geometric
string structure lifting the topological structure of the string bundle there could be
a nonzero obstruction (the canonical 3-form of the geometric string structure) to an
actual string connection, but it is still possible that changing the spin connection
on the underlying spin bundle and its lift to a geometric string structure this ob-
struction may vanish. The question whether a string bundle always admits a string
connection or not7 is, up to our knowledge, undecided at the moment and there
is no consensus on which answer should be expected, see, e.g., the discussion at
https://mathoverflow.net/q/426197.
4. Morphisms of morphisms of abelian groups and homotopy fibers
In Section 2 we have seen how one can associate a rigid symmetric monoidal
category to a morphism of abelian groups. This construction is actually functorial.
To see this, recall that morphisms of abelian groups are the objects of a category
whose morphisms are commutative diagrams.
That is, if ϕH : Hmor Ñ Hob and
ϕG : Gmor Ñ Gob are morphisms of abelian groups, then a morphism from ϕH to ϕG
is a commutative diagram of the form
Hmor
Hob
Gmor
Gob
ϕH
fmor
fob
ϕG
The pair pfob, fmorq deﬁnes a symmetric monoidal functor f : ϕb
H Ñ ϕb
G, and the
functoriality of the construction is easily checked. We recall the following
Deﬁnition 4.1. Given a functor p : D Ñ C and an object c of C, the homotopy ﬁber
(or essential ﬁber) of p over c is the category hoﬁb pp; cq with objects the pairs px, bq
with x an object in D and b P homCpc, ppxqq an isomorphism; morphisms from px, bq
to px1, b1q in hoﬁb pp; cq are those morphisms a : x Ñ x1 in D such that the diagram
ppxq
ppx1q
c
ppaq
b
b1
commutes. By relaxing the condition that b is an isomorphism, and allowing it to
be an arbitrary morphism, we obtain the notion of lax homotopy ﬁber and denote it
by hoﬁblax pp; cq.
7Or, more generally, whether a principal G bundle for G a Lie 2-group always admits a G-
connection as it is the case for ordinary Lie groups.

16
DOMENICO FIORENZA AND EUGENIO LANDI
When p : D Ñ C is a monoidal functor between monoidal categories, we will
always take c to be the monoidal unit 1C of C, and will simply write hoﬁb ppq and
hoﬁblax ppq for hoﬁb pp; 1Cq and hoﬁblax pp; 1Cq, respectively. It is immediate to see
that if p is a monoidal functor, the monoidal structures of C and D induce a natural
monoidal category structure on hoﬁb ppq and on hoﬁblax ppq.
Remark 4.2. If C is a groupoid, then there is no diﬀerence between the homotopy
ﬁber of p at c and its lax homotopy ﬁber. This consideration in particular applies
to the categories ϕb.
When p is the monoidal functor f : ϕb
H Ñ ϕb
G associated with a commutative
diagram of abelian groups, we can give a simple explicit description of the homotopy
ﬁber of p. This is provided by the following easy Lemma.
Lemma 4.3. Let
Hmor
Hob
Gmor
Gob
ϕH
fmor
fob
ϕG
be a commutative diagram of abelian groups, and let f : ϕb
H Ñ ϕb
G be the associated
monoidal functor. Then we have
Obphoﬁb pfqq “ Gmor ˆGob Hob
Morhoﬁbpfq ppg, hq, pg1, h1qq “
␣
x P Hmor s.t.
#
fmorpxq “ g1 ´ g
ϕHpxq “ h1 ´ h
(
.
Proof. By deﬁnition, an object in hoﬁb pfq is a pair pg, hq with h an object in ϕH
and g an isomorphism from 1ϕG to fphq in ϕG. Making this explicit, we see that
h P Hob, and g P Gmor is such that 0Gob ` ϕGpgq “ fobphq, i.e., ϕGpgq “ fobphq. This
gives Obphoﬁb pfqq “ Gmor ˆGob Hob. As far as concerns the morphisms, we have

INTEGRALS DETECTING DEGREE 3 STRING COBORDISM CLASSES
17
Proof. To begin with, let us check that Ξ does indeed take its values in kerpϕGqb.
For pg, hq an object in hoﬁb pfq, by Lemma 4.3 we have
ϕGpΞpg, hqq “ ϕGpg ´ λphqq “ ϕGpgq ´ fobphq “ 0Gob.
Since kerpϕGqb is a discrete category, in order to show that Ξ is a functor we only
need to show that a morphism x : pg, hq Ñ pg1, h1q in hoﬁb pfq induces an identity
Ξpg, hq “ Ξpg1, h1q. From Lemma 4.3 we know that x satisﬁes the two identities
fmorpxq “ g1´g and ϕHpxq “ h1´h. Since fmor “ λ˝ϕH, the two identities together
give
g1 ´ g “ fmorpxq “ λ pϕHpxqq “ λph1 ´ hq “ λph1q ´ λphq,
i.e., g ´ λphq “ g1 ´ λph1q which is the desired identity. The monoidality of Ξ is
manifest. To prove the second part of the statement, we begin by noticing that since
pg, 0Hobq is mapped to g, the functor Ξ is always essentially surjective and so it is
an equivalence iﬀit is fully faithful. If Ξ is fully faithful, then we must have
Morhoﬁbpfq
`
pg, hq, pg, hq
˘
“ t0Hmoru.
Since
kerpϕHq Ď kerpfmorq Ď Morhoﬁbpfq
`
pg, hq, pg, hq
˘
,
this implies the injectivity of ϕH. Since both p0Gmor, 0Hobq and pλphq, hq are mapped
by Ξ to 0Gmor, fully faithfulness implies the existence of a morphism from p0Gmor, 0Hobq
to pλphq, hq in hoﬁb pfq, and by Lemma 4.3 such a morphism is in particular an
element x in Hmor such ϕHpxq “ h. This shows that ϕH is also surjective, and so an
isomorphism. Vice versa, assume ϕH is an isomorphism, and let pg, hq and pg1, h1q
be such that Ξpg, hq “ Ξpg1, h1q. This is equivalent to λph1 ´hq “ g1 ´g. Since ϕH is
an isomorphism there exists a unique element x in Hmor such that ϕHpxq “ h1 ´ h.
We also have
fmorpxq “ λ pϕHpxqq “ λph1 ´ hq “ g1 ´ g
so that this element x is a morphism (necessarily unique) from pg, hq to pg1, h1q
in hoﬁb pfq.
Finally, let pg, hq and pg1, h1q be such that Ξpg, hq ‰ Ξpg1, h1q.
If
Morhoﬁbpfq
`
pg, hq, pg1, h1q
˘
is nonempty, then also MorkerpϕGqbpg ´ λphq, g1 ´ λph1qq
has to be nonempty, and so we get g ´ λphq “ g1 ´ λph1q, a contradiction. This
shows that if ϕH is an isomorphism then Ξ is an equivalence.

Proposition 5.2. The symmetric monoidal functor ZSpin

Proof. By deﬁnition of lax homotopy ﬁber, an object in the source of ZSpin
String consists
of an object in Bordor
4,3pBStringp2q
∇q, i.e., in a closed oriented 3-manifold M3 equipped
with a geometric string structure, together with a morphism in Bordor
4,3pBSpin∇q
from the unit object (i.e., the empty manifold) to the spin manifold underlying M3.
This is precisely the datum of a spin 4-manifold W4 with BW4 “ M3, equipped
with a spin connection ∇such that the restriction ∇

M3 coincides with the spin
connection datum of the geometric string structure η. In other words, the objects of

StringpM3, η, W4, ∇q,
where we see the quadruple pM3, η, W4, ∇q as a pair consisting of the object pM3, ηq
and of the morphism pW4, ∇q. On the object pM3, ηq we act with ZString at the object
level, obtaining the object

□
Remark 5.3 (Further examples). There are other situations where exactly the same
construction as the one we presented here applies. For instance one can replace the
ﬁrst fractional Pontryagin class 1
2p1 with the ﬁrst Chern class c1. In this case one
notices that the classifying space BSU of the special unitary group is the homotopy
ﬁber of c1: BU Ñ KpZ, 2q so that SU and U enjoy the same kind of relationship
as String and Spin. Then one verbatim repeats the construction presented in the
article to obtain an integral formula realizing the isomorphism
BordSU
1
– Z{2.

20
DOMENICO FIORENZA AND EUGENIO LANDI
In this case the relevant vanishing bordism group is BordU
1 “ 0, and the relevant
index theorem is Gauss-Bonnet formula: for a closed oriented 2-manifold W2 the
integer
ş
W2 c1pW2q is even.
Another example is obtained by going one step higher in the Whitehead tower
of the orthogonal group and consider the Fivebrane group instead of the String
group.
One has that the classifying space BFivebrane is the homotopy ﬁber of
1
6p2: BString Ñ KpZ, 8q, so Fivebrane is to String as String is to Spin, and one has a
vanishing 7-dimensional bordism group given by BordString
7
“ 0. For a closed oriented
string 8-manifold W8, which is in particular a closed oriented spin 8-manifold with
p1pW8q “ 0 in H8pW8; Qq, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem gives that

ş
W8 p2pW8q P 240Z, and verbatim repeating the arguments
in the present paper should give an integral formula realizing the isomorphism

– Z{240Z.
The reader should however be advised that the argument for ﬁvebrane bordism
sketched above is not complete: in order to make it fully work one would need to
know that any principal string bundle admits a string connection and as we noticed
in Remark 3.9 this is presently not clear. The fact that the argument presented
above produces the correct order 240 for the seventh ﬁvebrane bordism group could
be seen as an indication that the answer to whether every principal string bundle
admits a string connection may be aﬃrmative.
