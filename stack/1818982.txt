ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose a model for the initial stage of the development of the universe analogous to cavitation in a liquid in a negative
pressure field. It is assumed that at the stage of inflation, multiple breaks of the metric occur with the formation of areas of physical vacuum
in which the generation of matter occurs. The proposed model explains the large-scale isotropy of the universe without ultrafast inflationary
expansion and the emergence of a large-scale cellular (cluster) structure, as a result of the development of cavitation ruptures of a false vacuum.
It is shown that the cavitation model can be considered on par with (or as an alternative to) the generally accepted inflationary multiverse
model of the Big Bang.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the main problems of the Big Bang theory is the amaz-
ing homogeneity and isotropy of the observed cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation1,2 discovered in 1964 by Penzias and
Wilson3 and predicted earlier by Gamow.4 Also a mystery is the
cluster structure of the distribution of visible matter in the universe
and its uniformity at sizes exceeding 100 Mpc.1,2 The inflationary
model of the initial stage of the expansion of the universe, proposed
by Guth5 and further developed by Linde,6–10 Vilenkin,11–14 and oth-
ers,15–28 explains the observed isotropy and uniformity of the CMB
but causes a mixed reaction in the scientific world since it assumes
the generation of ∼1080 unrelated space–time universes at the stage
of inflationary expansion. The existence of our universe (one of the
myriad universes) where, as a result of evolution, life of the terrestrial
type arose is explained by the anthropic principle. Thus, to be consis-
tent with the inflationary model, the Hubble constant, characterizing
the expansion of our universe, varied from H ∼1042 s−1 −1036 s−1 to
the present value H ≈2.2 ⋅10−18 s−1.29–34
The inflationary theory of the expansion of the universe is
based on the presence of the Λ-term in the equations of the gen-
eral theory of relativity. The acceleration of the expansion of the
universe recently discovered by Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt35–38
is also explained by the presence of the Λ-term in the equations of
the dynamics of the universe. Nevertheless, many cosmologists are
skeptical about the existence of a superfast inflationary stage of the
Big Bang.29–34
It is known that the application of methods and approaches
developed in hydrodynamics is useful for solving various cosmolog-
ical problems (see, for example, Refs. 39–42).
In this paper, we propose a cavitation model of the inflationary
stage of the Big Bang, which is similar to cavitation in a liquid subject
to a negative pressure field. We use the concepts of false and physi-
cal vacuum accepted in the modern literature on the early universe.
False vacuum is a state in quantum field theory that is not a state cor-
responding to a local, not global, energy minimum. Such a state is
stable for a certain time (metastable), but it can “tunnel” into a state
of true vacuum. The true (physical) vacuum in quantum physics
is the lowest (ground) energy state of the quantized field, which
has momentum, angular momentum, and other quantum number
quantities equal to zero. The physical vacuum is also considered a
space completely empty of matter. Without going into the details of
the theory, it is important to note that a false vacuum corresponds
to a state with negative pressure, p < 0. The true (physical) vacuum
is associated with an empty space or with a space containing phys-
ical fields. In a space without a false vacuum filled with matter at a
nonzero temperature, the pressure is always positive. In our model,
as in Guth’s pioneering work,5 the effect of the cosmological Λ-term
is regarded as a source of negative pressure acting on the region of a
false vacuum, and the physical vacuum appears as vacuum bubbles,

which can be regarded as a break in the metric because in the field of
physical vacuum, the cosmological constant Λ becomes very small
or vanishes.
The introductory Sec. II considers in brief (a) the phenomenon
of cavitation in a liquid and the ideas underlying its understanding,
(b) the legitimacy of the application of these ideas to the early stage
of the expansion of the universe, and (c) the difference between the
standard inflationary and cavitation models in their description of
the transition from a false vacuum to a physical one.
Section III considers the proposed cavitation model of the infla-
tionary stage of the expansion of the universe. It is shown that within
the framework of this model, it is possible to explain the isotropy
and homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the
distribution of visible matter, and the observed large-scale cellular
(cluster) structure of the universe.
Section IV qualitatively examines the expansion of the
“cavitation” bubble in a false vacuum and the generation of mat-
ter/energy at its borders. Qualitative considerations are presented to
explain the inhomogeneous distribution of energy in cells associated
with bubbles of the physical vacuum.
In Conclusions, the main results and consequences of the cavi-
tation model for the inflationary stage of the universe expansion are
formulated in brief.
II. CAVITATION IN A LIQUID (BRIEF INTRODUCTION)
The similarity of the observed large-scale cellular pattern of
the universe to the region of developed cavitation in a liquid is not
accidental in our opinion. It is supported by the fact that the early
inflationary stage of the expansion of the universe is associated with
the cosmological term in the Einstein equations, which plays the role
of negative pressure in the cavitating fluid. We believe that the infla-
tionary stage of the development of the universe is accompanied by
breaks in the metric – the appearance of “bubbles” of the physical
vacuum, similar to the formation of bubbles in a liquid at nega-
tive pressure, the absolute value of which exceeds a certain critical
value.
The main difference between our approach and the one
adopted in the inflationary theory is that the transition from a false
vacuum to a physical one does not take place all at once in the
entire universe due to the “rolling” of the universe into a potential
well2 but rather takes place initially at certain points, which later
become the cells of the large-scale structure observed in the universe.
The emergence of “bubbles” of the physical vacuum significantly
slows down the inflation of the universe at the inflation stage and
serves as a place for the generation of matter in them. Moreover,
the formation of metric discontinuities during the transition from a
false vacuum (where repulsion due to the Λ-term acts) to a physi-
cal vacuum is an isotropizing factor since negative pressure is kept
in areas of false vacuum near the threshold of generation of dis-
continuities; any local excess of negative pressure is damped by an
increase in the number of “bubbles” of the physical vacuum. There-
fore, superfast inflation in times <10−32 s is not required for large-
scale homogeneity and isotropy of the matter density distribution
and CMB in our universe. Note that a similar feedback mechanism
of formed cavitation bubbles, which limits the magnitude of the neg-
ative pressure in the cavitating liquid, was considered by authors in
Refs. 43 and 44.
For an ideal gas, the pressure is always positive; only the pres-
sure difference can be negative. In contrast, “negative pressure” is
a key concept in fluid mechanics of liquids with stretching tension
that may lead to cavitation or formation of voids. In other words,
negative pressure is possible only in media, inside of which natural
boundaries with a thickness much less than the characteristic size
of cavities (bubbles) can exist. In a gas, such “natural” boundaries,
and hence negative pressure, cannot exist since gas molecules fill any
empty region of space.
Thus, the presence of negative pressure at the inflationary
expansion stage of the universe, caused by the presence of the
Λ-term, allows us to consider the universe as a liquid in which
natural boundaries can exist that separate the “false vacuum” with
the equation of state ρ + p
c2 = 0 from the real physical vacuum with
zero energy density or filled with matter with p ≥0. The presence
of boundaries between “false vacuum” and true vacuum, as is well
known (see, for example, Ref. 1), leads to the generation of parti-
cles due to tidal forces associated with the gradient of the gravi-
tational field at the discontinuity of the metric. In Sec. IV, we will
qualitatively consider these phenomena.
Three fundamental ideas lie in the theory of the formation and
dynamics of cavitation bubbles in a liquid. The first concerns the
cause of bubble expansion in a liquid,45 the second concerns the
mechanism of bubble formation,46 and the third concerns the mech-
anism limiting the rate of bubble formation (the reverse influence of
the emerging bubbles on the rate of their generation).43,44
1.
In 1917, Rayleigh introduced the concept of negative pressure
and wrote a simple condition under which a bubble either
expands or collapses.45 The sum of pressures acting on the
boundary surface of the bubble is
P = P−+ PL,
(1)
where PL = 2σ/Rb is the Laplace pressure, σ is the surface ten-
sion coefficient, Rb is the bubble radius, and P−is the negative
pressure (Fig. 1). Since the Laplace pressure drops to ∼1/Rb
with an increase in the bubble radius, then for
∣P−∣> 2σ

(2)
bubbles grow indefinitely. The source of negative pressure in
a liquid can be the pressure of saturated vapors in a bubble,
injection of a gas into a liquid, or stretching of the liquid itself
(e.g., behind the front of a shock wave).
2.
In 1942, Zel’dovich,46 and independently Fisher in 1948,47
considered the formation of a bubble as a local liquid-
saturated vapor phase transition under negative pressure
caused by the stretching of the liquid. According to
Zel’dovich, the number of bubbles of radius Rb produced per
unit time depends exponentially on the energy required to
create it,

For water, as an example, σ = 0.072 N/m and T = 300 K,
∣Pcr∣∼700 MPa. This value is more than 10 times higher than that
observed in experiments.48 We need to take into account that the
pre-exponential factor in (5) reduces ∣Pcr∣to 220 MPa.3 It was shown
in Ref. 43 that considering the dependences of the surface tension
coefficient on negative pressure and bubble radius makes it possible
to bring the critical pressure at which cavitation begins to approach
the experimentally measured values, which are close to 30 MPa
–50 MPa.48
Due to the exponential dependence of Γ on ∣P−∣
kBT consequently
even with a slight excess of the absolute value of the negative pres-
sure in the liquid above the threshold, the number of bubbles of
a critical size arising in a unit volume can exceed the number of
water molecules. The mechanism limiting the rate of growth of
the density of cavitation bubbles was considered by the authors in
Refs. 43 and 44. It was shown that for any initial value of negative
pressure exceeding the critical one, it will always decrease to a value
close to the critical one as a result of the expenditure of energy stored
in the excess negative pressure on the generation and growth of cav-
itation bubbles. Below, we will discuss this mechanism in brief using
water as an example since it is key to the cavitation model of the
expansion of the universe at an early stage.
A. Classic cavitation: Saturation effect on the bubble
generation rate
Assume that the volume in which a super-critical negative pres-
sure occurs is of the order of l3
−. The formation of bubbles is asso-
ciated with an increased volume of the cavitation region, which in
turn leads to excessive positive pressure that reduces the value of
the negative pressure in the area. The density of bubbles nb that

of pore formation in (3).

However, as was shown in experiments with liquid helium (see, for
example, Ref. 45) at low temperatures, ∣Pcr∣does not depend on
temperature.
The temperature dependence of the nucleation rate (3) is called
the Arrhenius law. Arrhenius assumed such temperature depen-
dence for the rates of chemical reactions. If we follow the Arrhenius
law, the probability of formation of cavitation bubbles in cryogenic
liquids such as 4He and 3He should tend to zero at T →0. How-
ever, in experiments,50 nucleation at temperatures below 1 K did
not depend on temperature because in cryogenic liquids, the forma-
tion of cavitation bubbles does not follow the Arrhenius law but is
determined by the tunnel effect.
B. Cavitation in a cryogenic liquid: The tunnel effect
The possibility of tunnel nucleation (creation of growing bub-
bles) in liquid helium was first considered by Lifshitz and Kagan in
197251 in the quasi-classical approximation. The expression for Γ in
this case does not depend on temperature as in (3) and (4) but is
determined by the eigenvalues of the energy of zero-point vibrations
in the potential well and the height of the potential barrier. A theory
describing the tunneling production of bubbles in the general case
was developed in Ref. 43. The approach described below can serve as
a model for constructing a theory of the formation of “bubbles” of a
true vacuum in a false vacuum at the stage of inflationary expansion
of the universe.
The kinetic energy associated with the expansion of the bubble
(kinetic energy of the added mass) is45

(15)
In accordance with Ref. 51, we formally write the Lagrange func-
tion for a bubble as the difference between the kinetic energy of the
bubble (15) and the potential energy (4),

In (16), we neglected the fluid expansion (the dependence of ρ on

Considering that in our thin layer approximation the velocity

quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian (18) for a point particle
corresponds to the stationary Schrödinger equation, we can assume
that Eq. (18) corresponds to the equation43

where Ψ is the wave function. The passage from the classical Hamil-
tonian (18) to the Schrödinger equation (19) is carried out by the
standard replacement of the momentum ⃗pb and the Hamiltonian Hb
with the corresponding operators ˆpb = −i h−∂
∂⃗r and ˆHb = i h−∂
∂t acting
on the wave function Φ = eiEt/ h- Ψ(r).
Equation (19) differs from the usual Schrödinger equation in
which the particle is considered to be pointwise in the Schrödinger
equation and the square of the modulus of the wave function
describes the probability of being in a given point in space. Whereas
in our case, described by Eq. (19), “particles” correspond to a hollow
sphere with an infinitely thin shell with a mass M = 4πρR3
b depend-
ing on its radius, and the square of the modulus of the wave func-
tion describes the probability that the shell will have a radius Rb.
Of course, if the mass M is constant, Eq. (19) goes into the usual
Schrödinger equation. Thus, as for the conventional Schrödinger
equation, our task is to find the spectrum of the eigenvalues E and
the corresponding eigenfunctions for Eq. (19) at a given fixed value
of negative pressure P−.
As an example, let’s consider the tunneling regime of cavita-
tion in 4He. Figure 4 shows the potential barrier and wave functions
χ = xΨk corresponding to the self-energies of Eq. (19) describing
tunneling nucleation for 4He in a negative pressure field.43 The ver-
tical lines on Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) correspond to the values of x at
which Ub = E. At x2 > x > x1, the wave function decays. At x > x2,
the pore radius begins to grow since the surface tension cannot
compensate for the tensile forces associated with negative pressure.
For T →0, only the zero mode contributes to the bubble formation
probability Γ. At a finite temperature of helium, higher modes
also contribute. The estimate of the nucleation rate based on the
quantum mechanical description has the following form:43

m is the volume of the
Helium atom, dm is the radius, Ek is the eigenvalue of the k-th mode
in Kelvin, and Ψk(x2,k) is the value of the k-th wave function at point
x2 (see Fig. 4). It should be noted that at ∣P−∣= 1.78 MPa in 4He,
there are only two cavitation modes.
Below, we will study how the inflationary stage of the expansion
of the universe can change, if the tunnel inception of cavitation is
possible, similar to cavitation in cryogenic liquid helium.
III. CAVITATION INFLATION MODEL
In traditional inflationary cosmological models, it is assumed
that at the initial stage, there is a phase transition from a false
vacuum to a physical one, with an explosive release of energy.
As a result, a superfast (inflationary) expansion of the universe
occurs, which is subsequently replaced by inertial expansion.1,2 This
approach is generally accepted for most modern cosmological mod-
els with the cosmological Λ-term.1,2 Inflationary expansion, as we
said above, was introduced to explain the isotropy of the CMB and
the mass distribution on scales of the order of 1000 Mpc.

3 ˜ρV)
1/2 = ˜Λ1/2, which
corresponds to the solution of Eq. (21).
Following the analogy with the tunneling mechanism of cavita-
tion generation in cryogenic liquids,43 described in Sec. II B, we will
consider space–time with a false vacuum as a kind of quantum liq-
uid (similar to cryogenic helium), which can be in one of two states.
In one of the false vacuum states, the formation of physical vacuum
bubbles does not occur. In another, the formation of physical vac-
uum bubbles becomes possible. The two states are separated by a
potential barrier, the height of which depends on the value of the
cosmological Λ-term (which determines the effective negative pres-
sure). The higher the absolute negative pressure, the lower the height
of the barrier. We may also assume that the false vacuum is in the
ground state, similar to the one considered above (the zero mode for
4He, shown in Fig. 4) as an example.
By analogy with cavitation in a liquid, described in Sec. II, we
will assume that for a value of negative pressure ∣˜P−∣> ∣˜Pcr∣in the
false vacuum (the region where the energy-momentum tensor in the
Einstein’s equations corresponds to the presence of the Λ-term), dis-
continuities of the metric begin and the “bubbles” of the physical
vacuum appear, in which the energy-momentum tensor is equal to
zero. If ∣˜P−∣< ∣˜Pcr∣, then the probability of cavitation rupture forma-
tion is sharply reduced. The appearance of “bubbles” of the physical
vacuum leads to a decrease in the absolute value of negative pressure
(Λ-term) and accordingly leads to a decrease in the probability of
the formation of new discontinuities in the metric. Thus, space–time
“cavitation” (the formation of “bubbles” of the physical vacuum) is
an isotropization factor in the universe since it keeps negative pres-
sure in any part of the universe near the threshold for generation of
discontinuities.
Since Λ = 0 in the “bubbles” of the physical vacuum, they do not
contribute to the expansion of the universe. Therefore, the effective
(averaged over the entire volume of the universe) negative pressure
can be written as ˜P−= −˜ρV(1 −˜v), where ˜v is the relative volume
occupied by the “bubbles” of the physical vacuum. Accordingly,
Eq. (22) takes the following form:
1
a
d2a
dτ2 = 8π
3 ˜ρV(1 −˜v).
(23)
Since with an increase in the volume of physical vacuum ˜v the abso-
lute value of negative pressure ∣˜P−∣falls, then a moment should come
when the appearance of new discontinuities in the metric (areas of
transition from a false vacuum to a physical one) will become impos-
sible. Let us write out a phenomenological equation describing the
generation of discontinuities, similar to Eqs. (3) and (12),
dn
dτ = ξ ⋅exp(−
β
˜ρV(1 −˜v)),
(24)
where β is a parameter characterizing the threshold at which the gen-
eration of discontinuities begins and ξ is a pre-exponential factor
similar to those of (3) and (20).
Taking into account the expansion of the universe, the relative
volume occupied by the discontinuities has the following form:
˜v = ∫

dτ′ (r0

= ∫

a(τ′)3

)

dτ′,
(25)
where a0 and r0 are the initial size of the universe and the discontinu-
ity (physical vacuum “bubble”) radius in Planck units, respectively.
Since regardless of the size of the universe a the metric discontinuity
that appeared at the moment of time τ′ has the size r0, the relative
volume in (25) at this time τ′ is equal to (r0/a(τ′))
3. In (25), we
took into account that the physical vacuum bubble over time begins
to expand at the rate of expansion of the universe at the time the
bubble appears.
Substituting (24) into (25), we obtain
˜v = ξ∫
τ

˜ρV(1 −˜v(τ′)))( r0

(26)
Since with increasing ˜v the exponent factor
β
˜ρV(1−˜v) in (25) grows as
∼
1
(1−˜v), then, over time, the generation of bubbles will stop when
β
˜ρV(1−˜v) ≫1. Hence, consequently, the parameter
β
˜ρV must always
be less than unity since if
β
˜ρV > 1, the generation of bubbles will be
significantly suppressed from the very beginning.
On the other hand, for ˜v ≪1, the size of the universe grows
exponentially, a = a0eγVτ. Therefore, the relative volume occupied by
bubbles is
˜v = ξa3

(27)
It follows from (27) that if
ξ
3γV ≪1, the bubble formation does
not play a role. It should be noted that since for any values of
β
˜ρV
and
ξ
3γV the relative volume of “bubbles” of the physical vacuum
never reaches unity, the presence of discontinuities only reduces the
exponent of the inflationary expansion of the universe.
To demonstrate the effect of cavitation at the inflationary stage,
let us choose, for example, the dimensionless density ˜ρV = 0.01, cor-
responding to γV = 0.29/tp. Figure 5 shows the calculation results
taking, for example, β = 10−5, ˜ρV = 0.01, and r0 = 0.05 for the val-
ues ξ = 150 and 50. Since for τ > 5 the relative volume of “bubbles”
of the physical vacuum ceases to depend on time [Fig. 5(a)], the
radius of the universe enters the exponential stage. For τ ≥5, new
discontinuities do not affect the expansion of the universe.
So far, we have considered the case of the formation of phys-
ical vacuum bubbles without taking into account the generation of
radiation and massive particles at the boundaries of the metric dis-
continuities. Let us choose the following model of effective mass
generation in a bubble. Let the mass density in the universe be
proportional to the relative volume occupied by the true vacuum,
˜ρR = ˜v˜ρ0,R, where ˜ρ0,R is the density of matter in Planck units. Below
(Sec. IV), it is shown that a physical vacuum bubble is a potential well

for particles generated at the boundary between a false and physi-
cal vacuum – in other words, massive and massless particles do not
spread throughout the entire volume of the universe but are concen-
trated in “bubbles.” Accordingly, Eqs. (23)–(25) take the following

where θ = ˜ρ0,R/˜ρV and u = dRb/dt is the rate of expansion of the dis-
continuity boundary in units of the speed of light, independent of
the rate of expansion of the universe. The question as to the rea-
sons for the increase in the size of the “bubble” of the true vacuum,
which is not associated with the general expansion of the universe, is
considered in Sec. IV.
It is convenient to introduce the variable ˆv = ˜v(1 + θ), trans-
forming Eqs. (28)–(30) to the following form:

dτ2 = −8π

Equations (31) and (32) coincide with (23) and (24), respectively,
and (32) at u = 0, up to the factor (1 + θ), coincides with (25).
Over time, the relative volume occupied by the expanding
“bubbles”—the areas of the physical vacuum—becomes dominant,
and the radiation expansion of the universe begins. This is described,
in the adopted variables, by the equation1

where aR is the radius of the universe at which the false vacuum is
almost completely replaced by the physical one and the inequality
(1 −˜v) ≪1 becomes valid.
Let us consider the case when at the initial moment of time
n = n0 discontinuities of the metric (“bubbles” of the physical vac-
uum) with radius r0 ≪a0 appear, after which their radii grow in
accordance with Eq. (33). In this case, dn

Figure 6 shows the computed results for β = 10−5, ˜ρV = 0.01,
r0 = 0.05, θ = 0.04, u = 0.0005, and ξ = 150 and 50. As seen from
Fig. 6(a), in a relatively short time on the order of τ ≈3, “bubbles”
of physical vacuum are generated, which then expand until they
displace the false one. Bubbles born after τ ≈3 practically do not
contribute to the volume of physical vacuum.
Indeed, the main contribution to the displacement of the false
vacuum by “bubbles” will be made by bubbles that have arisen in
a time on the order of

FIG. 6. Inflationary stage of expansion of the universe with discontinuities in density and finite energy density generated at the edges of the “bubble” of the physical vacuum
(Sec. IV). The calculation parameters are β = 10−5, ˜ρV = 0.01, r0 = 0.05, θ = 0.04, u = 0.0005, and ξ = 150 and 50. (a) Dependences of the quantities ˜v (lines 1 and

universe. Line 1 corresponds to the case without generation of true vacuum bubbles, while lines 2 and 3 correspond to the case with generation of such bubbles. Line 2
corresponds to ξ = 150, and line 3 corresponds to ξ = 50. The vertical lines show the values at which the true vacuum displaces the false one and the radiation expansion
of the universe begins. For τ ≥5, new discontinuities do not affect the value of ˆV and correspondingly on growths of a (a).
Figure 7 shows the result of the calculation, with the same
parameters as in Fig. 6, now assuming r0 = 0. The dotted lines in
Fig. 7(a) show a solution corresponding to (31).
In light of the above, the scenario of the initial stage of the
expansion of the universe can be divided into three stages. At
the first stage, over a fairly short period of time, a certain num-
ber of false vacuum breaks are generated in the universe and
are evenly distributed. At the second stage, the resulting voids
of true vacuum areas expand due to the generation of radia-
tion energy at their boundaries, and this expansion rate exceeds
the expansion rate of the universe because of the remaining false
vacuum (see Sec. IV). At the third stage, the formed “bubbles”
of true vacuum completely cover the entire volume of the uni-
verse, forming a foamy-like structure (radiation energy is con-
centrated in the bridges between the voids). At this stage, the
generation of energy ends, and the cooling of the universe and
the process of nucleosynthesis begin, corresponding to the stan-
dard model of the Big Bang. As for dark energy and dark matter,
in accordance with the described scenario, they should be con-
centrated in narrow, denser clusters, where most of the visible
matter is concentrated, bordering on rarefied regions of the cosmic
web.

FIG. 8. Bubble of a physical vacuum in a false vacuum. The border separating the
true vacuum from the false one is a source of energy (particles). The arrows show
the direction of motion of the generated particles. They cannot leave the area of
the bubble due to the anti-gravitational forces acting on them from the side of the
false vacuum.
IV. THE BOUNDARY OF THE TRUE VACUUM BUBBLE
Consider the true vacuum bubble of radius Rb formed in
false vacuum in the frame of reference associated with the cen-
ter of a spherically symmetric discontinuity for a time much
less than the characteristic time of the expansion of the universe

has the form
ds2 = evc2dt2 −eλdr2 −r2(dθ2 + sin2θ).

the letter denotes the derivative with respect to time, and the prime

In the area of the false vacuum (r ≥Rb), Λ ≠0, while in the
area of the true vacuum (r < Rb), Λ = 0. This implies that ˙λ = 0 and
accordingly that the second term on the right-hand side of (38) is
equal to zero. Without going into the details of some straightfor-
ward calculations, we write out an expression for the ds interval in
the regions of false and true vacuum,

The transition from a false vacuum to a real one requires special
consideration that goes beyond the scope of the article, so we restrict
ourselves to the assumption that this transition region exists and has
a finite thickness δr ≪r0.
Consider the forces acting on particles in the region of false and
real vacua. Considering the gravitational field at the discontinuity to
be independent of time, the force acting on a particle of mass m and
velocity v in the centrally symmetric case, according to Ref. 53, is

The force at the border is directed toward the physical vacuum. This
is to be expected since the cosmological constant Λ acts as antigravity
which “pushes” any particles out of the false vacuum.

From (43), consequently, the restoring force acting on the par-
ticle increases given a larger radius of the “bubble” of physical vac-

Let us qualitatively describe the process of matter generation at the
boundary between physical and false vacuum using the example of
the creation of a massive particle–antiparticle pair. Since the force
acting on a particle with mass in the region of the false vacuum
r = Rb + 0 is not equal to zero [formula (39)] and at the point
r = Rb −0 is equal to zero, then at the border of the false and true
vacuum, the tidal forces arise,
ft = f +0 −f −0 ≈
mc2
√
1 −v2

ΛRb.
(46)
To create a particle–antiparticle pair, tidal forces must perform work
equal to twice the rest mass of the particles at a length scale on the
order of the de Broglie length of the particle (antiparticle).
This energy is taken from the negative energy of the false vac-
uum, defined by a non-zero Λ-term. Thus, the generation of a sub-
stance in a bubble of a physical vacuum is accompanied by the
“melting” of a false vacuum, which determines the velocity u in
Eq. (30). The radius of the physical vacuum bubble grows with the
expansion of the universe. Therefore, relative to the center of the
bubble, the source of matter (energy) escapes with a velocity equal
to the relativistic sum of the expansion velocity of the universe and
the speed of “melting” of the false vacuum. Thus, at the border of
each bubble of the physical vacuum, a thin layer of matter is formed,
held by its own gravitational field and moving away from the center
of the bubble.
V. CONCLUSIONS
1.
A cavitation model of the inflation stage is proposed, in
which it is assumed that at a certain value of negative pres-
sure (Λ-term in Einstein’s equations) metric discontinuities
occur – regions of physical vacuum are formed where the
Λ-term is equal to zero.
2.
It is shown that the discontinuities of the metric during the
transition from a false to a physical vacuum are an isotropiz-
ing factor since they keep negative pressure in any part of the
universe near the threshold of generation of discontinuities.
Any local excess of negative pressure is quickly damped by an
increase in the number of “bubbles” of physical vacuum.
3.
It is shown that taking into account cavitation significantly
slows down the inflation process.
4.
The mechanism of generation of matter in the universe at the
stage of inflationary expansion is indicated, and it is shown
that matter should be concentrated in the vicinity of bound-
aries of bubbles of the physical vacuum. A model of cavi-
tation inflation is built, taking into account energy genera-
tion. The transition from inflationary to radiation expansion
is qualitatively analyzed.
5.
The bubbles of physical vacuum can be the embryos of the
large-scale cellular structure of the universe.
6.
Since the observed “voids” in the structure of the universe are
the result of the evolution of the “bubbles” of the physical
vacuum that arose at the initial stage of inflationary expan-
sion, the observed size of the rarefied regions (voids) should
decrease with increasing distance from an observer.
