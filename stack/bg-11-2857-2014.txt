Abstract. Ocean acidiﬁcation is a result of the uptake of an-
thropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean and
has been identiﬁed as a major environmental and economic
threat. The release of several thousands of petagrams of
carbon over a few hundred years will have an overwhelm-
ing effect on surface ocean carbon reservoirs. The recorded
and anticipated changes in seawater carbonate chemistry
will presumably affect global oceanic carbonate production.
Coccolithophores as the primary calcifying phytoplankton
group, and especially Emiliania huxleyi as the most abun-
dant species have shown a reduction of calciﬁcation at in-
creased CO2 concentrations for the majority of strains tested
in culture experiments. A reduction of calciﬁcation is asso-
ciated with a decrease in coccolith weight. However, the ef-
fect in monoclonal cultures is relatively small compared to
the strong variability displayed in natural E. huxleyi com-
munities, as these are a mix of genetically and sometimes
morphologically distinct types. Average coccolith weight is
likely inﬂuenced by the variability in seawater carbonate
chemistry in different parts of the world’s oceans and on
glacial/interglacial time scales due to both physiological ef-
fects and morphotype selectivity. An effect of the ongoing
ocean acidiﬁcation on E. huxleyi calciﬁcation has so far not
been documented in situ. Here, we analyze E. huxleyi coc-
colith weight from the NW Mediterranean Sea in a 12-year
sediment trap series, and surface sediment and sediment core
samples using an automated recognition and analyzing soft-
ware. Our ﬁndings clearly show (1) a continuous decrease
in the average coccolith weight of E. huxleyi from 1993 to
2005, reaching levels below pre-industrial (Holocene) and
industrial (20th century) values recorded in the sedimentary
record and (2) seasonal variability in coccolith weight that
is linked to the coccolithophore productivity. The observed
long-term decrease in coccolith weight is most likely a re-
sult of the changes in the surface ocean carbonate system.
Our results provide the ﬁrst indications of an in situ impact
of ocean acidiﬁcation on coccolithophore weight in a natural
E. huxleyi population, even in the highly alkaline Mediter-
ranean Sea.

Introduction
A key question in global climate change research is how
the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere into
the ocean will affect the ocean ecosystem in the near future
(Bindoff et al., 2007; Kleypas et al., 2006; Kroeker et al.,
2013). Model projections have shown that the global carbon-
ate system will undergo substantial changes with a drastic
decline in pH and calcium carbonate saturation by the end
of the century (Orr et al., 2005; Zeebe, 2012). Calcifying or-
ganisms are most likely to be negatively affected by the pro-
cess commonly called ocean acidiﬁcation (OA), and a series
of studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of calciﬁcation

K. J. S. Meier et al.: Emiliania huxleyi coccolith thinning in the Mediterranean Sea
in response to OA for a variety of different organism groups
(Kleypas, 1999; Lischka et al., 2011; Moy et al., 2009; Riebe-
sell et al., 2000; van de Waal, 2013). Coccolithophores are
the major calcifying phytoplankton group and a reduction
in coccolithophore calcium carbonate production inﬂuences
the global carbonate cycle and reduces organic carbon export
(Gehlen et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2012). Various culturing
studies have demonstrated that the most abundant coccol-
ithophore species Emiliania huxleyi reacts to increased CO2
with a decrease in calciﬁcation, but the response is highly
variable between strains (De Bodt et al., 2010; Langer et
al., 2009; Hoppe et al., 2011). The genetic diversity among
E. huxleyi (Read et al., 2013) even contains a haplotype that
can heavily calcify under elevated CO2 and is environmen-
tally restricted to high latitudes and upwelling regions (Beau-
fort et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2012), but this has not been re-
ported in the Mediterranean thus far (Beaufort et al., 2011).
The in situ response to OA is more difﬁcult to investigate,
as physiological measurements on coccolithophore calciﬁca-
tion are not feasible over extended time periods in the ﬁeld.
The degree of coccolith calciﬁcation is deﬁned as the “pri-
mary variation in amount of biogenic calcite incorporated
in a coccolith” (Young et al., 1997). Coccolith calciﬁcation
is expressed by coccolith weight and increases under con-
ditions that are favorable for coccolithophore calciﬁcation.
Therefore it is an indicator for the calciﬁcation rate of the
coccolithophore cell (Bach et al., 2012). A global study on
the variations of coccolith weight over the natural range of
CO2 concentrations in the world’s oceans has shown that
coccolith weight decreases with increasing CO2 and this ef-
fect can also be traced back in sedimentary archives of the
last glaciation under natural CO2 variations (Beaufort et al.,
2011). However, the variability in the degree of coccolith
calciﬁcation between E. huxleyi types is an important factor
when investigating the response of average coccolith weight
to OA events in natural assemblages (Berger et al., 2014),
and previous reports on an increase in E. huxleyi weight in re-
sponse to ocean acidiﬁcation may be due to morphotype vari-
ability (Beaufort et al., 2011; Grelaud et al., 2009; Iglesias-
Rodriguez et al., 2008). In summary, coccolith weight de-
creases in laboratory experiments mimicking future OA sce-
narios, it decreases during periods of natural CO2 increase
during the last glacial termination, and it is currently lower in
oceanic regions with naturally elevated CO2 concentrations.
In this study we tested whether the ongoing ocean acidiﬁ-
cation has already affected the weight of E. huxleyi in the NW
Mediterranean Sea. We carried out weight measurements on
E. huxleyi coccoliths from a sediment trap series deployed
in the Gulf of Lions from 1993 to 2005, and compared them
to environmental data in order to determine which environ-
mental factors may have driven changes in coccolithophore
calciﬁcation. We also investigated sediment records from the
region representing the 20th century and the Holocene in or-
der to test if coccolith weight has decreased since the begin-
ning of the industrial age.

Site description
The Mediterranean Sea is known to be highly supersaturated
with respect to carbonate throughout the entire basin from the
surface to depth (Álvarez et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2010,
2007). At the same time, it serves as a sink for anthropogenic
CO2, which is absorbed in the surface layers and transported
into the deeper parts of the basin through mixing (Ait-Ameur
and Goyet, 2006; Bethoux et al., 2005). The absolute values
of anthropogenic carbon in the Mediterranean Sea are excep-
tionally high and a decrease in pH between 0.061 and 0.148
since the pre-industrial age has been suggested (Schneider et
al., 2010; Touratier and Goyet, 2011; Touratier et al., 2012).
These unique features make the Mediterranean an interesting
subject for studying the effect of anthropogenic acidiﬁcation
on calcifying organisms.
A key area that combines all of these aspects is the NW
Mediterranean. A natural annual variation in pCO2 driven
mainly by temperature can be observed in the surface water
column with the highest values occurring in the upper 50 m
in summer under well-stratiﬁed conditions (Copin-Montégut
et al., 2004). In winter the water column becomes unstable
at temperatures below ∼13 ◦C and the surface water mixes
with the underlying intermediate waters that are rich in dis-
solved inorganic carbon (DIC). This leads to an increase in
pCO2 in surface waters in autumn and early winter when bio-
logical production is low. However, mixing also brings nutri-
ents into the photic zone resulting in phytoplankton blooms
beginning in late winter and early spring, which lead to a
pCO2 decrease (Copin-Montégut and Bégovic, 2002; Copin-
Montégut et al., 2004).
Long-term algal pigment observations at the Dynamics of
Atmospheric Fluxes in the MEDiterranean Sea (DYFAMED)
site in the NW Mediterranean Sea have shown that hapto-
phytes (including coccolithophores) are generally the domi-
nant algal class throughout the year (Marty and Chiaverini,
2010; Marty et al., 2002). Production of haptophytes is high-
est in February/March and mostly takes place between 20
and 50 m water depth (Marty et al., 2002). This annual cy-
cle is controlled by a seasonal change between nitrate limita-
tion during winter and phosphate limitation during summer
(Marty et al., 2002).
A prominent hydrological change was observed in the NW
Mediterranean Sea in 2006, with a warming of the deeper
water masses due to mixing of the entire water column dur-
ing winter (Marty and Chiaverini, 2010). This event was pre-
sumably preconditioned by drought years from 2003 to 2005,
leading to a salinity increase and subsequently more intense
mixing in winter. After these intense mixing events, nutrient
levels were higher than usual, leading to diatoms becoming
more abundant during the following spring blooms (Marty
and Chiaverini, 2010).

Material and methods
The sediment trap material investigated here originates
from the Gulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean Sea (43◦02′ N,
5◦11′ E, 1030 m water depth, Fig. 1). A sediment trap was
continuously deployed over 6-month periods from 1993 to
2005 in the Planier canyon at 500 m water depth and 530 m
above the bottom. No samples were available for the peri-
ods February–April 1994, June 1996–January 1997, June–
September 2000 and May–September 2004. The collected
particles used here were ﬁltered and picked to remove mi-
crozooplankton from the samples. The trap details and the
description of the original sample processing have been pub-
lished before (Heussner et al., 2006). Trap cups were ﬁlled
with a formalin solution and neutralized with sodium borate,
and pH was monitored before deployment and before pro-
cessing to verify and ensure carbonate preservation.
Splits of the original sediment trap samples were brought
into homogenous suspension in water. An aliquot represent-
ing between 0.2 and 2 mg of trap particles was taken from the
suspension with a glass pipette and placed on a 47 mm diam-
eter and 0.45 µm pore size cellulose nitrate ﬁlter. The ﬁlter
was oven dried at 50 ◦C over night and embedded in Canada
balsam on a glass slide to make the ﬁlter transparent.
All slides were analyzed with a polarizing microscope (Le-
ica DMRBE) with a 2 megapixel Spot Insight camera. Rou-
tine checks on the assemblage showed that E. huxleyi dom-
inated the assemblage throughout the record. 40 ﬁelds of
view were taken automatically and analyzed with the auto-
mated recognition software SYRACO (Beaufort and Doll-
fus, 2004). Image analysis was performed on the output ﬁles
for Emiliania huxleyi to obtain length and weight of the indi-
vidual coccoliths. In total 35 602 coccoliths were identiﬁed.
Only those data points within the inner fence of a box and
whisker plot of coccolith length and weight were included in
the analysis (values larger than 4.22 µm length and 12.28 pg
weight were eliminated – 1035 data points). For methodolog-
ical details see previous studies (Beaufort, 2005; Beaufort et
al., 2011, 2008).
The selected surface and the Holocene sediment samples
were collected during RV Meteor cruise M40/4 (1998). Mul-
ticorer station #82 from the Gulf of Lions (42◦18.51′ N,
3◦46.4′ E, 1078 m water depth, 0–1 cm) spans approximately
the last 40 to 80 years, assuming approximate sedimenta-
tion rates of 0.1 to 0.15 cm yr−1 (Miralles et al., 2005) and
a bioturbation depth of 5–8 cm for the position. The gravity
core station #87 taken near the Balearic Islands (38◦59.28′ N,
4◦1.38′ E, 1913 m water depth, 0–30 cm, sampled every cm)
covers the time span of about 200 to 10 800 years BP (Emeis
et al., 2003). Smear slides were prepared using standard pro-
tocols and coccolith measurements were carried out as de-
scribed above.
Environmental data covering the time span of the analyzed
trap samples were collected from the DYFAMED database

parameters, temperature, salinity and nutrient measurements
are only available for the DYFAMED site, which is located
about 200 km east of the trap position (43◦25′ N, 7◦52′ E),
i.e., upstream with respect to the general E–W circulation
of the Northern Current along the slope (Fig. 1). It has been
shown before that this data can be used for comparison with
the sediment trap data (Heussner et al., 2006). Carbonate
system measurements (i.e., alkalinity and DIC) are only
available for the years 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005. Data
were obtained for the upper 200 m of the water column.
Missing measurements were replaced with values obtained
from linear regression of the measurements from above and
below. [CO2] and pH were calculated from the measured to-
tal alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon measurements
with the CO2SYS macro (Lewis and Wallace, 1998) using
the CO2 dissociation constants by Mehrbach et al. (1973),
reﬁt by Dickson and Millero (1987), KHSO4 by Dickson
(1990) and the seawater scale for pH. This data based on
carbonate system measurements was then compared to
theoretical carbonate system parameters calculated by the
CO2SYS macro as described above, by using atmospheric
[CO2] and alkalinity calculated from salinity (Schneider et
al., 2007) for the entire time span.

1997) and particulate inorganic carbon data (PIC) are derived

close as possible to the trap location (43◦N, 5◦10′ E, 10′ res-
olution).
A singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was carried out on the
coccolith weight and the environmental data sets using the
software package R and following the method described in
Golyandina and Korobeynikov (2012). For this, an evenly
spaced time series without gaps (monthly values) was pro-
duced from the data. Monthly averages were calculated in
those cases where traps were sampled twice in one month.
Small gaps (less than 3 months) were ﬁlled by linear inter-
polation between the values before and after the gap. Longer
gaps were ﬁlled using the monthly averages from all years,
which were adjusted for the speciﬁc year. Gap ﬁlling meth-
ods are explained in detail in supplementary Fig. 1.
The SSA decomposed the data into trends, seasonal sig-
nals and residuals. For analysis of the seasonality, the trends
and 12-month frequencies were added and run through a
principal component analysis (PCA) in order to determine
which variables explain most of the variance in the data.
Cross-correlation was calculated on the time-series and on
the seasonal signals extracted by the SSA to determine if a
lagged response of E. huxleyi coccolith weight to the envi-
ronmental parameters is likely.

Results and discussion
4.1
E. huxleyi coccolith weight and length
Seasonality and long-term trends are clearly shown in the
weight and length of E. huxleyi coccoliths collected by the
sediment trap investigated here (Fig. 2). The mean weight of
E. huxleyi coccoliths shows maxima from February to May
and minima from August to November during most parts of
the record. The annual amplitude in average weight is about
1 pg. There are two periods in the record during which max-
ima occur twice a year. From 2001 to 2002 and from late
2004 to late 2005 maxima occur around January and June
(Fig. 2a, b). Average coccolith length shows little seasonal
variability with an amplitude of about 0.1 µm (Fig. 2c, d).
The inter-annual variability in weight and length of E. hux-
leyi is relatively small, but a long-term decrease can be ob-
served from 1993 to 2005 (Fig. 2a, c), with a more pro-
nounced decrease starting in 2001 and a further decrease
only in weight from September 2004 onwards. Annual mean
weight values decrease from about 5 pg in the ﬁrst part of the
record to less than 4 pg towards the end, equaling approxi-
mately a 20 % reduction in average weight (Fig. 2a, c). An-
nual mean length values show the same trend, but decrease
only from 3.16 to 3.06 µm, which is a reduction of about 3 %.
Theoretically, a reduction in length could be responsible for a
decrease in weight without changing how well the coccolith
is calciﬁed. Coccolith weight has been shown to be approx-
imately linearly correlated to the cube of coccolith length
(Young and Ziveri, 2000). This means that a 3 % reduction

in length (a reduction to 97 %) equals approximately a 9 %
loss in weight (0.973 ≈0.91), which is considerably less than
the observed weight decrease of about 20 %. Therefore, coc-
colith weight decreases more than can be expected based on
the length reduction, indicating that coccoliths become less
calciﬁed.
There are four intervals in the 1993–2005 trap deployment
during which exceptionally low weight and length values
of about 2 to 3 pg and less than 3 µm have been observed
(Fig. 2). These are November 1993 to April 1994, June to
November 2000, May to August 2004 and September to De-
cember 2005. As these extremely low measurements are not
randomly spread over the record but last over periods of sev-
eral months, it is likely that they represent a mechanism that
leads to decreased coccolith weight. Carbonate dissolution
during or after sample preparation is unlikely to have oc-
curred, as all samples have been treated in the same way, and
previous studies did not show a decrease in the carbonate
content during these periods (Heussner et al., 2006). In most
of these samples very few coccoliths were detected (Fig. 2),
which suggests that E. huxleyi production could have been
lower. The years 2000, 2004 and 2005 were characterized
by intense mixing events during late winter (Marty and Chi-
averini, 2010). In late winter and early spring of these years
E. huxleyi is still abundant, but in the following months num-
bers decrease to a minimum (Fig. 2). As diatoms have a
tendency to be more abundant during years following mix-
ing events (Marty and Chiaverini, 2010), the decrease in

E. huxleyi production may be related to a different phyto-
plankton community structure. In addition, in the years 2000
and 2004 coccolith weight changes from a one maximum per
year to a two maxima per year signal after these coccolith-
poor periods (Fig. 2). This may indicate, that the normal sea-
sonal development of the E. huxleyi population was disturbed
following intense winter mixing. The unusual seasonality can
last for extended periods. After the change in late 2000 it took
the system until 2003 before a normal seasonal signal estab-
lished again in E. huxleyi weight (Fig. 2).
The low weight period in winter 1993/1994 at the begin-
ning of the trap record is different from the other events.
Here, coccolith weight is already low during a moderate mix-
ing event that is indicated by a sudden temperature drop mea-
sured at the trap (Heussner et al., 2006) and lasts exception-
ally long. Coccolith numbers are exceptionally low only dur-
ing part of this event (Fig. 2), indicating normal productiv-
ity. The exact mechanism leading to these periods with ex-
tremely low coccolith weight and length values remains un-
clear, but it seems very likely that they represent exceptional
phases that are different from the normal seasonal signal in
the record. Therefore, measurements from these periods have
been excluded from all analyses.
4.2
Sediment transport
Seasonal changes in sediment resuspension plays an impor-
tant role in particle transfer on the Gulf of Lions margin
(Canals et al., 2006; Heussner et al., 2006). In a previous
multi-sediment trap study, including the trap investigated
here, a linear increase of the carbonate content in the sedi-
ment trap material with increasing mass ﬂux was observed
(Heussner et al., 2006). In the samples used here the in-
ﬂuence of biological production on the sedimentation was
shown to be highest compared to other settings in the Gulf
of Lions (Heussner et al., 2006). This is likely because the
trap was deployed in relatively shallow water (500 m water
depth, mid-water column) and was located in the eastern part
of the Gulf of Lions where the inﬂuence of resuspended ma-
terial transport is smallest (Heussner et al., 2006). The lack
of a linear relationship between total mass ﬂux and the num-
ber of E. huxleyi coccoliths per gram of particles in our trap
is shown in Fig. 3. This indicates that the majority of E. hux-
leyi coccoliths are likely to reﬂect the actual export produc-
tion rather than resuspension, as has also been observed for
silicoﬂagellates in the same trap (Rigual-Hernández et al.,
2010).

small inﬂuence of sediment transport and resuspension on coccolith

4.3
Environmental controls
Emiliania huxleyi coccolith weight and length have been
shown to vary with different environmental parameters. Pos-
sible causes for the observed seasonal and long-term vari-
ations in E. huxleyi weight and length could be E. huxleyi
morphotype selectivity related to environmental factors, or
a physiological response to the changing environment, e.g.,
changes in E. huxleyi calciﬁcation due to natural environ-
mental variability (seasonal) or global change (such as long-
term ocean acidiﬁcation, global warming).
4.3.1
Seasonal variation in temperature, nutrients,
salinity and the carbonate system
The seasonal variability in temperature, salinity, nutrient con-
centration and the carbonate system parameters is clearly ex-
pressed in both the raw measurements and the SSA extrac-
tion of the seasonal signal (Figs. 4 and 5). The seasonal com-
ponent of the signal is larger than the trend component in
most of the parameters, except for coccolith weight, atmo-
spheric CO2 and pH (Fig. 5). This is the reason why atmo-
spheric CO2 and pH are the only parameters with a signiﬁ-
cant (but very low) correlation to coccolith weight (Table 1).
However, when assuming a lagged response, signiﬁcant cor-
relations can also be found with temperature, nitrate, phos-
phate, alkalinity, [CO2], [CO2−
3 ] and Calcite but still low
r values (Table 1). Regarding only the seasonal signals ex-
tracted with the SSA further improves the correlation (Ta-
ble 2). The highest signiﬁcant correlations were found with
coccolith weight lagging two months behind temperature,
Calcite, [CO2−
3 ] (r values around −0.7), [CO2] (r ∼0.7),

are best correlated to coccolith weight with no lag (r ∼0.7
and −0.6), while salinity and alkalinity show best correla-
tions with coccolith weight lagging 4–5 months (r ∼-0.4 and
−0.5). The results from the PCA analysis on the combined
trend and seasonal signals from the SSA analysis summa-
rize these ﬁndings (Fig. 6). The ﬁrst PCA axis explains 62 %
of the variance and represents temperature, Calcite, [CO2−

[CO2], nitrate and phosphate, i.e., those parameters in which
the seasonal signal dominates and that show best correla-
tions with coccolith weight assuming a lagged response of
two months. The second PCA axis explains 31 % of the vari-
ance and is controlled by the parameters with a strong trend
component, i.e., atmospheric CO2 and pH, but also picks up
the seasonal signal in salinity and alkalinity, with the best
correlation to coccolith weight at lag of 4–5 months.
From this analysis, the normal seasonal succession in en-
vironmental variables and coccolith weight can be identiﬁed.
In February, at the beginning of the spring bloom in the Gulf
of Lions area, temperature and thus also Calcite and [CO2−

are lowest, but nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) reach their
maximum. The spring bloom starts with diatoms, followed
by haptophytes (including coccolithophores), which reach
their maximum between February and May (Marty et al.,
2002). During the course of the bloom, nutrients decrease
while temperature increases. Coccolith weight increases dur-
ing the bloom, reaching maximum values about 2 months af-
ter the onset. The causal relationships between the different
variables and coccolith weight are difﬁcult to determine sta-
tistically, as there is considerable covariation between the pa-
rameters. Comparison with earlier studies may help to iden-
tify which of the correlations found in our data set are mean-
ingful.
E. huxleyi morphotypes show a distinct temperature pref-
erence in the NW Paciﬁc, with a morphotype below 4.1 µm
length preferring warmer waters, and larger morphotypes
characteristic of colder water masses (Hagino et al., 2005). In
paleoceanographic studies, E. huxleyi coccoliths > 4 µm are
frequently used as a cold-water indicator (Flores et al., 2010).
In our record there is no detectable seasonal variability in
E. huxleyi length and the vast majority of coccoliths mea-
sured here are below 4 µm, implying that the length variation
observed in our data cannot result from E. huxleyi morpho-
type temperature selectivity. In addition, a direct inﬂuence of

temperature on coccolith weight has not been found in cul-
turing experiments (De Bodt et al., 2010) or to be statisti-
cally signiﬁcant in a recently published global study (Beau-
fort et al., 2011). In our study, however, E. huxleyi coccolith
weight has its maximum in February to May when temper-
atures are still relatively low and decreases during summer
when temperatures reach a maximum of about 16 to 20 ◦C in
the upper 40 m (Figs. 4 and 5). Therefore, the possibility that
the temperature increase during the year contributes to de-
creased average weight in E. huxleyi cannot be ruled out en-
tirely, as the statistical support for temperature is highest. As
mentioned above, the seasonal temperature variability also
causes changes in the carbonate system (Copin-Montégut et
al., 2004), which in turn could be responsible for coccolith
calciﬁcation changes (see below).

mental data in Fig. 4 by a single spectrum analysis (SSA). Monthly
averages and the deviation from the average for every year (bars)
are shown.
Salinity has been suggested to inﬂuence E. huxleyi mor-
phometry, which has been consequently proposed as an in-
dicator for past sea surface salinity (Bollmann et al., 2009;
Fielding et al., 2009). However, a recent global survey has
shown that the calciﬁcation state of E. huxleyi is not related
to salinity (Beaufort et al., 2011), which is conﬁrmed by our
data. The salinity variability is too small (Figs. 4 and 5) to ac-
count for a substantial change in coccolith length (Bollmann
et al., 2009) and from all variables tested, the statistical sup-
port for salinity (and alkalinity) controlling coccolith weight
is lowest. Therefore salinity is not one of the main factors
controlling weight and length of E. huxleyi here.
Nutrient availability inﬂuences calciﬁcation in E. huxleyi
in two ways: increased coccolith weight has been observed
in cells grown under higher nutrient conditions and pro-
duced during coccolithophore blooms (Beaufort et al., 2007),
but also under phosphate limitation despite slower growth
(Kayano and Shiraiwa, 2009; Müller et al., 2008; Satoh et al.,
2009). At the trap site both effects may play a role. Satellite-
derived primary production data shows a seasonal productiv-
ity cycle with maxima occurring in late winter/early spring,
and phosphate limitation occurring in summer (Figs. 4 and
5). Absolute nutrient values are highest in winter (December
to February) with about 6 µmol L−1 nitrate and 0.2 µmol L−1
phosphate, and then decrease to extremely low values in sum-
mer. The lower part of the photic zone also shows little sea-
sonal variability but generally slightly higher values, up to 8
µmol L−1 nitrate and 0.4 µmol L−1 phosphate (Figs. 4 and 5).
Coccolith weight of E. huxleyi shows a seasonal cycle that

Figure 6. PCA of the combined seasonal and trend data from the
SSA. The ﬁrst PCA axis explains 62 % of the variance, the second
axis 31 %. The data clusters in months (represented by grey num-
bers) and the arrows point in the direction of the maximum values.
The main coccolithophore production season from February to May
(Marty et al., 2002) is marked in green. At the beginning of the sea-
son, nutrients and [CO2] are highest, while temperature, [CO2−
3 ]
and Calcite are lowest. A 2-month lag between these initial condi-
tions and the maximum in coccolith weight is observed.
lags 2 months behind the nutrient and productivity pattern
(Figs. 4 and 5), whereas coccolith length shows no prominent
seasonality. This lagged response may be due to the presence
of diatoms at the beginning of the spring bloom. The general
productivity pattern in the Gulf of Lions seems therefore to
be responsible for an increase of E. huxleyi coccolith weight
in February to May. If the P-limitation in summer has an ef-
fect, it is not strong enough to level out the seasonal signal
in E. huxleyi weight, but may be one of the reasons for the
reduced seasonal signal in E. huxleyi coccolith length. A less
pronounced seasonality in nitrate and phosphate concentra-
tions in 2001 and 2002 is paralleled by a reduced seasonal
signal of E. huxleyi coccolith weight (Fig. 4), further indica-
tion of the importance of nutrient supply for E. huxleyi calci-
ﬁcation. Interestingly, the PIC data does not follow the pro-
ductivity and coccolith weight trends (Fig. 4). As recently
shown (Daniels et al., 2012) this may be due to suspended
particles that are common in coastal regions.
A recently published conceptual model on the effects of
the carbonate chemistry on coccolithophore calciﬁcation de-
scribes calciﬁcation following an optimum curve response to
gradients in pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (Krug
et al., 2011). Calciﬁcation will decrease outside the optimum

conditions, with decreasing pH and increasing DIC in the
case of OA. An experimental design to test the effect of in-
dividual parameters of the carbonate system has conﬁrmed
that pH, [HCO−
3 ] and [CO2−
3 ] are the main factors control-
ling coccolith morphology and weight (Bach et al., 2012).
[CO2−
3 ] was also the most statistically signiﬁcant factor con-
trolling coccolith weight in a global set of sediment and water
samples (Beaufort et al., 2011).
In the data presented here, the seasonal signal can be ob-
served on the carbonate system (e.g., [CO2], pH, [CO2−
3 ],
Calcite) in the water column at the DYFAMED site (Figs. 4
and 5). The upper part (0–50 m depth) shows stronger sea-
sonal variability with elevated [CO2] and decreased [CO2−
3 ]
in late winter and early spring. The lower part (70–200 m
depth) shows the opposite and a weaker signal (Fig. 4).
The upper and lower parts of the water column have simi-
lar [CO2] and [CO2−
3 ] values during winter and early spring
when the water column is well mixed (Fig. 4). The tem-
perature increases only in the upper 50 m of the water col-
umn during the year (Fig. 4) indicating stratiﬁed conditions
in summer and autumn. This leads to a decrease in [CO2]
and an increase in [CO2−
3 ] in the upper 50 m of the water
column (Copin-Montégut and Bégovic, 2002), whereas the
lower part is relatively stable. Seasonal variations in carbon-
ate chemistry such as Calcite, [CO2−
3 ] and [CO2] therefore
strongly covary with temperature. The largest average coc-
colith weight of E. huxleyi over the year is reached in Febru-
ary to May despite the elevated [CO2] and low [CO2−
3 ] val-
ues. Therefore, the effect of the seasonal variation in the car-
bonate system parameters is smaller than the effect of the

increase in coccolithophore production shown above (Figs. 4
and 5), in agreement with a recently published global survey
(Beaufort et al., 2011).
In summary, temperature, nutrients and carbonate chem-
istry are statistically the most likely candidates for control-
ling the seasonal changes in coccolith weight. Due to the
strong covariation between the parameters, it is difﬁcult to
identify the signiﬁcance of single parameters. The combined
effect of all parameters seems to control the phytoplank-
ton succession during the spring bloom. Emiliania huxleyi
weight is highest from February to May, which is during the
maximum in production of haptophytes. This follows earlier
observations, that optimum growth conditions favor calciﬁ-
cation in coccolithophores.
4.3.2
Long-term trends
The Mediterranean Sea has undergone acidiﬁcation since the
onset of industrialization and the effect is largest in the NW
Mediterranean Sea (up to 0.14 pH units, Touratier and Goyet,
2011; Touratier et al., 2012). Between the two time periods
for which direct measurements of the carbonate system are
available, [CO2] increases about 1 µmol kg−1, pH drops by
about 0.02, [CO2−
3 ] decreases by 7 µmol kg−1, and the calcite
saturation decreases by 0.14 units when comparing the time
periods from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005 (Fig. 7). The
calculated carbonate system parameters for the entire record
are in the same range and show the same seasonal amplitude
as the direct measurements (Fig. 4). The SSA analysis con-
ducted on this data, coccolith weight and other environmental
data reveals signiﬁcant trends only for coccolith weight and
pH, whereas temperature, nutrients, salinity and other car-
bonate system parameters present limited variability (Fig. 8).
Therefore, the most likely cause for the observed mass loss
of E. huxleyi coccoliths is the observed change in surface wa-
ter pH. However, also other parameters for which no data is
available may have an additional inﬂuence, such as irradiance
and turbidity (e.g., Charalampopoulou et al., 2011).
Further support for a reduction of coccolithophore calci-
ﬁcation due to the inﬂuence of ocean acidiﬁcation comes
from the comparison of pre-industrial Holocene and indus-
trial 20th century records of coccolith weight with the sedi-
ment trap data. From 1994 to 2000, the scale of the observed
weight variability in E. huxleyi coccoliths from the sediment
trap is within the range of that recorded in pre-industrial
Holocene sediments (Fig. 9). From 2001, annual averages lie
in the range of the 20th century surface sediments of the Gulf
of Lions, that cover an approximate range of about 40–80
years before the sampling in 1998. From 2004 they fall be-
low these 20th century average weight values (Fig. 9). Even if
long-term sediment records that average over a considerable
amount of time (40–80 years in the 20th century surface sed-
iment, and a few hundred years in the Holocene record) may
not be directly comparable to the interannual trend from the
sediment trap, two conclusions can be drawn: (1) coccolith

K. J. S. Meier et al.: Emiliania huxleyi coccolith thinning in the Mediterranean Sea
weight is lower in sediments from the 20th century than in
the pre-industrial Holocene and (2) during recent years the
average weight of E. huxleyi coccoliths has sunk to values
unprecedented in the last 10 000 years.

Physiological vs. morphotype selectivity
Recent evidence suggests resilience to lower pH environ-
ments for a genetically distinct type of the common species
E. huxleyi (Beaufort et al., 2011; Read et al., 2013), indi-
cating that the community response of coccolithophores to
OA may be different from what can be observed in labo-
ratory experiments on just one strain. Our study examines
a natural assemblage and it is very likely that the coccol-
iths measured here represent more than just one genetic type
within E. huxleyi (Read et al., 2013). This natural E. hux-
leyi assemblage shows a response to OA, which may be due
to both physiological responses, e.g., a decrease in calciﬁca-
tion, and morphotype selectivity within E. huxleyi. This gives
two possible explanations for the observed discrepancy be-
tween ﬁeld and laboratory studies: (1) strains tested in culture
are unusual in their response to OA and only display small
changes in calciﬁcation compared to the majority of types in
natural populations. There are, however, different types that
have been tested in culture and while the response is vari-
able, it is still within a similar order of magnitude (Hoppe
et al., 2011). (2) Therefore, the observed weight decrease in
the natural assemblage is probably due to a change in rel-
ative abundance of types, with lightly calcifying types be-
come more abundant over time. Likewise, the seasonal vari-
ation may be due to alternating populations over the year.
This has been demonstrated in a different part of the Mediter-
ranean Sea, where winter/early spring populations are dom-
inated by a heavily calcifying E. huxleyi morphotype, while
lighter-calcifying types are present during summer (Trianta-
phyllou et al., 2010). Our data also shows stronger calciﬁed
coccoliths during late winter and spring. This seems to be
more likely due to a population change as the magnitude in
weight change would be difﬁcult to explain by physiological
responses.
Alternating populations may also explain the periods of
extremely low weights that occur over the record. These oc-
cur after strong mixing events, when the phytoplankton com-
munity is dominated by diatoms. Only few coccolithophores
are found during these periods and they probably represent
lightly calcifying types. As these mixing events become more
frequent towards the end of the record, they may also be
responsible in part for the coccolith weight decrease. The
mechanism would then rather be a regime shift towards a
diatom-dominated spring bloom that prevents the prolifera-
tion of heavily calciﬁed E. huxleyi morphotypes.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that long-term and seasonal variabil-
ity in the average weight of E. huxleyi coccoliths in the Gulf
of Lions has different causes. In the long-term the seawater
carbonate system displays the strongest change of all envi-
ronmental parameters. Change in the surface water pH is the
parameter most likely to have caused the decrease of E. hux-
leyi coccolith average weight below Holocene and 20th cen-
tury values in the western Mediterranean Sea. Productivity
has a large inﬂuence on E. huxleyi weight on the seasonal
scale and future changes in the nutrient regime may have ad-
ditional inﬂuence on the CaCO3 quota in coccolithophores.
Still, this study is only a ﬁrst step in understanding what the
effects of ocean acidiﬁcation on coccolithophore calciﬁca-
tion will be in the future. As the physiological response to the
changing environment may be smaller than the ecological re-
sponse, future work should try to disentangle these two pro-
cesses of coccolithophore community calciﬁcation response
to ocean acidiﬁcation for reliable projections of the future
global carbonate production.
