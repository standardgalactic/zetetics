Abstract
A good grasp of hydro-morphodynamic processes plays a major role in modern river manage-
ment to accommodate its often-conﬂicting functions. In the last century, a variety of models has
been developed to improve our perception of sediment transport and the resulting changes in
river bed topography, using several empirical formulations. Therefore, there is a demonstrated
need to establish a framework that helps the river engineer to select the closest model to the
measurements.
This study suggested a Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) framework to direct the modeler to-
wards the most robust and sensible representation of the hydro-morphodynamic conditions of
the river under investigation. The proposed framework employs Bayesian Model Evidence
(BME) resulting from Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) as a model evaluation yardstick for
ranking competing models. BMA performs a compromise between bias and variance, i.e. it
blends a measure for goodness of ﬁt with a penalty for unacceptable model complexity. This
approach requires many model simulations, which are computationally expensive. However,
this issue can be deminished by a mathematically optimal response surface via the aPC tech-
nique projects the original model. This response surface, also known as a reduced (surrogate)
model, can exhibit the reliance of the model on all relevant parameters for calibration at high-
order accuracy.
The proposed framework was implemented in the model selection of two test cases; namely a
test case model, based on an experiment done by Yen and Lee (1995) and a river model of a 10-
km stretch of the lower Rhine, provided by the Federal Waterways Research Institute (BAW) in
Karlsruhe. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework was acceptably able to detect
the most desirable model in which a good agreement existed between the simulation results and
measurement data when the complete knowledge of initial parameters lacked. Further, the BMS
framework could direct us to the most probable parameter regions for the task of optimization
via probability density distributions of uncertain variables. Overall, this research ﬁlls a void
in the literature with respect to selection of sediment transport equation for representation of
hydro-morphodynamics of natural rivers. The suggested approach provides an objective guid-
ance in the model selection to assist even less experienced users by reducing the professional
expertise required for further optimization tasks.

1 Introduction
Rivers are present in nature in a variety of forms, such as straight, sinuous, meandering, and
braided, because of interacting processes among water ﬂow, sediment transport, and vegeta-
tion. Anthropogenic activities can severely modify these processes often resulting in undesired
and unforeseen consequences at a variety of spatial and temporal levels. This modiﬁcation
causes safety problems, environmental hazards, as well as environmental degradation, with
massive resources and economic damages for the entire society. Therefore, modeling of hydro-
morphodynamics, also known as river morphodynamics, is vital to understand how the men-
tioned interacting processes work. The results can assist decision-making at multiple levels that
can promote environmentally friendly and cost-effective river basin and land management.
However, modeling the complex interactions of hydro- and morphodynamic processes is driven
by various physical and numerical parameters, and many processes are reproduced using empir-
ical formulations. Generally, several formulations for the same process (e.g. bed load transport
equation) exist and the modeler must be aware of the limitations of these models to be able to
reproduce the real behaviors of the river.
The current chapter starts with Section 1.1 that contains the deﬁnition of the term hydro-
morphodynamics and the necessity of its modeling. In Section 1.2, an overview of hydro-
morphodynamic investigations is provided. Section 1.3 brieﬂy highlights the development of
morphodynamic models; i.e. sediment transport models, over the course of time. A comparison
of transport models is presented in Section 1.4 followed by the challenges of model selection in
Section 1.5. The objective of this study is elaborated in Section 1.6. At last, the outline of the
present study is presented in Section 1.7.
1.1 Hydro-Morphodynamics
Modern river management must accommodate numerous functions, such as ﬂood protection
and provision of safe and efﬁcient navigation, ﬂoodplain agriculture, ecology, and recreation.
Thus, a good grasp of hydro-morphodynamic processes, which assess the hydraulic regime

and sediment transport in rivers, plays a signiﬁcant role to serve its often-conﬂicting functions,
especially for multi-function rivers in densely populated areas.
Hydro-morphodynamics comprises of hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. Both terms will
frequently be used throughout this study, and are worth deﬁning from the outset. Hydrodynam-
ics is a part of ﬂuid mechanics that is concerned with forces applying on or exerted by ﬂuids
and is widely used in engineering practices to study how energy and forces interact with ﬂuids.
A river hydrodynamic model uses a series of equations to explore how the conservation laws of
mass, energy, and momentum apply to the incompressible liquid, water. These models enable
a river engineer to investigate the processes in water bodies and provide predictions at various
scale levels. These levels are as follows: (I) in planning and design - to assess the effectiveness
and the impact of river engineering works, to satisfy planning and design speciﬁcations; (II)
in operational forecasting - e.g. information required about the rise of ﬂood levels to decide
whether detention basins must be deployed or whether there is a need for emergency measures
such as evacuation or forced inundation; (III) in maintenance - to sustain the river for ﬂood
conveyance and navigation.
On the other hand, river morphodynamics is the study of river bed topography in response
to erosion and sedimentation. The understanding of river morphodynamics is essential for
proper management and prediction of critical erosion and sedimentation processes occurring
in streams, such as bank erosion, sediment balance in dam regulation, sediment wave propaga-
tion, interactions with man-made structures (bridges, weirs), silting up of reservoirs, sediment
mining, degradation/aggradation, planform changes.
1.2 Overview of Hydro-morphodynamic Investigations
The ﬁrst observation of water ﬂow and sediment transport was carried out during the Renais-
sance period by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1510), the Italian artist and engineer (Wu, 2008).
Since then, scientists and engineers conducted many studies on river processes. Water ﬂowing
in natural rivers is capable of scouring riverbeds, carrying particles (heavier than water) and
depositing materials, resulting in the bed topography changes. In this phenomenon sediment
transport is of great importance. The reasons include but are not limited to risk assessment of
scouring of bridges, weirs and channel banks; estimation of the siltation in an upstream reservoir
of a dam; prediction of possible bed form changes of rivers and estuaries (Apsley, 2014).
The development of sediment transport models has been insigniﬁcant, in comparison with the
other branches of science, and the proposed theories have not been able to predict the actual

16
Introduction
sediment discharges accurately. The reason stems from the dependency of sediment discharge,
in a complex way, to several parameters related to ﬂow and sediment. These parameters include
depth, width, density, energy gradient, temperature, viscosity, and turbulence of the ﬂowing
water, as well as the size distribution, shape, density, cohesiveness, and concentration of the
moving particles. Consequently, presenting a mathematical model which accounts for all these
wide-ranging parameters in longitudinal and lateral directions, to predict the amount of moving
material, is a strenuous task.
Due to this difﬁculty, almost all the existing sediment load predictors have been derived under
certain simpliﬁcations and assumptions that are seldom met in natural rivers. Hence, in gen-
eral, a fraction of the inaccuracies in sediment discharge estimations can be accredited to the
underlaying assumption (Habibi, 1994; Papanicolaou et al., 2008).
Another source of difﬁculty in the development and assessment of sediment load predictors
is the presence of uncertainty in sediment transport data. This uncertainty is largely because
of limitations in measurement equipment and the signiﬁcant temporal and spatial variations of
concentration and transport rates of sediment particles in natural channels. Traditional mea-
surement procedures of bed bathymetry, grain size distribution, bed morphology and velocity,
and shear stress distributions use limited point or cross-sectional measurements. They are, thus,
applicable to a limited spatial and temporal resolution and prevent satisfactory model calibra-
tion and veriﬁcation (Papanicolaou et al., 2008). Therefore, the current primary effort aims at
reducing the uncertainty in the morphodynamic model results.
1.3 Advancement of Sediment Calculations
The sediment transport investigations are founded upon the premise that a particular relationship
exists between hydraulic parameters, and bed material characteristics of a stream, and the rate
at which the ﬂow transports the particles. In the period of over a century since du Boys (1879)
presented the ﬁrst "modern" equation, a plenty of formulae has been introduced. For the ﬁrst
few decades, the focus of most studies maintained on the estimation of bed load transport.
Afterward, from 1937 with the induction of the concept of turbulence in ﬂuid mechanics mostly
by Prandtl and von Karman, more efforts were made for the formation of suspended and total
material load equations.
Bed load is the fragment of the bed material that migrate periodically during ﬂood events, either
via rolling or sliding motion or via jumping in the river channel. Many ﬂuvial research and man-
agement applications require estimates of bed load because it controls the three-dimensional

17
morphology of streams. The bed load transport formulae appear based on four fundamental
concepts: (I) critical bed shear stress or ﬂow discharge, e.g. du Boys (1879), Meyer-Peter and
Müller (1948) and Schoklitsch (1934), (II) stochastic and probability concepts for sediment
movement, e.g. Einstein (1950) and Misri et al. (1984), (III) energy exchange of the ﬂow, e.g.
Bagnold (1966) and Celik and Rodi (1991) and (IV) dimensional and regression analysis, e.g.
Rottner (1959) and Ackers and Rodney White (1973).
The development of most bed load transport formulae could be regarded mainly in two stages.
Firstly, a theoretic relationship is obtained which attempts to relate the bed load transport rate
to hydraulic and sedimentological quantities. In the former case, this typically contains the
derivation of an equation which describes the transport conditions that are observed in a suite
of experimental and, sometimes, ﬁeld data e.g. Schoklitsch (1934), Rottner (1959), Parker and
Klingeman (1982), and Bathurst (2007). However, in the latter the formation of a relationship
from fundamental mechanical or physical principles, e.g. Yalin (1963). Secondly, the basic
equation regularly has been revised taking into account its performance against data of initial
analysis, e.g. Meyer-Peter et al. (1934) or, by the improvement of coefﬁcients and factors of the
formulae by available data, e.g. Ackers and Rodney White (1973).
Numerous bed load transport formulae originate from the original author’s experimental data,
which usually have been accompanied by data obtained by one or several other investigators,
commonly including that of Gilbert (1914), e.g. Schoklitsch (1934). Moreover, the capability
of a formula has been regularly evaluated based on its agreement with a limited amount of
ﬁeld data (Müller, 1937). Thus, most formulae owe their origin to a relatively limited data set,
though their effectiveness has been established via comparatively few ﬁeld data. It is a matter
of concern that there seem to be more bed load formulae than reliable datasets by which to test
them. Consequently, none or even few formulae have been either widely accepted or recognized
as being particularly appropriate for designated application.
1.4 Comparison of Transport Models
A considerable importance has been attached to independent evaluations of the performance of
the various sediment transport equations, particularly to those assessments, which have included
ﬁeld data. According to López et al. (2014), key components that affect the performance of
equations are inherent bed load transport variability, the changing alluvial conditions of the
river bed and sampling efﬁciency. While the scarcity of reliable ﬁeld data apparently has not
eased veriﬁcations of bed load transport formulas, there has been some attempts to evaluate
their performance.

18
Introduction
Johnson (1943) was perhaps the ﬁrst person to launch a comparison of the performance of
bed load transport formulas, through least squares regression, using observed (ﬂume) data.
He concludes that the selection among the examined methods (the du Boys, Chang, MacDou-
gal, Meyer-Peter, O’Brien, and U.S. Waterways Experiment Station formulae) might be made
merely based on the "comfort" of the variable measurements, required for the calculation.
Since the ﬁrst comparison of Johnson (1943), several evaluations of the performance of bed
load transport formulae, using both ﬁeld and laboratory data have been published subsequently.
These studies are included but not limited to Hubbell and Matejka (1959), Jordan (1965), Cole
et al. (1973), Shulits and Hill (1968), White et al. (1973) , Carson and Grifﬁths (1987), Yang and
Wan (1991), Chang (1994); Reid et al. (1996), Batalla (1997), Martin (2003), Martin and Ham
(2005). Batalla (1997) concludes that the degree of accuracy between observed and predicted
values differs signiﬁcantly from one formula to another. Moreover, he reports the percentage
of observations in which the discrepancy ratio between observed and predicted rates fell in
a range between 0.5 and 2.0. The reported percentage ranges from 25% (van Rijn) to 38%
(Brownlie), 52% (Meyer-Peter and Müller), 65% (Engelund -Hansen), and 68% (Ackers and
White). Similarly, most evaluations deduced that no formula performs reliably satisfactory; this
can be accredited to the limitations of the test data and the restrictions of the experiment and
the physical characteristics of the transport phenomenon (López et al., 2014).
Most efforts to assess the performance of bed load transport formulae have been commenced
through the simple comparison of the calculated (bed-load) sediment transport rate with the
measured bed-load transport rate of either a laboratory ﬂume or a natural stream. However,
Carson and Grifﬁths (1987) thoroughly examined some assumptions underlying the entire ap-
proach to computing gravel bed load, as well as the form of some renowned equations. Also,
they speciﬁed research directions, which is essential to present a more comprehensive under-
standing of the river behavior.
Gomez and Church (1989) conducted one of the most comprehensive evaluations of bed load
formulae. Given the results and recommendations of their study, the following notes can be
made:
(I) In spite of being evaluated over a relatively wide range of hydraulic conditions, the perfor-
mance of many of the formulae has not been evaluated outside the range of grain sizes from
which they were derived (mostly sand to ﬁne gravel size range).
(II) It seems to have been little effort to select test data which is consistently related to the
hydraulic and sedimentological conditions which the formulae were explicitly intended to de-
scribe (e.g. steady ﬂow and equilibrium sediment transport conditions). The authors assert
that laboratory data commonly refer to ﬂume studies with signiﬁcant sidewall effects, or poorly

deﬁned hydraulic and sedimentological parameters, and the sediment discharge measurements,
which more accurately describe the total or suspended load instead of the observed bed load
transport rate.
Overall, most evaluations conclude with a recommendation or representative formula, but no
universal relationship between bed load discharge and hydraulic conditions has been established
yet (Habersack and Laronne, 2002).
1.5 Challenges in Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
Several failures, such as bridge collapse (pier foundation erosion), the formation of sand bars in
estuaries and navigable rivers, destruction of banks and levees, stemmed from the incapability
of engineers to predict hydro-morphodynamic conditions of rivers such as sediment motion.
Despite the improvement in the description of physical processes, the degree of accuracy in
morphodynamic model results remains challenging to assess and is also less than that of hydro-
dynamics alone (Villaret et al., 2013).
Bed-load transport rates are extremely challenging to predict. Robert (2003) argues that the
complexity and irregularity of natural coarse-grained surfaces lead to the hurdle in the prediction
of bed-load transport rates. He declares that this complexity results in speciﬁc problems in
deﬁning the initiation of bed-load transport for a wide range of particle sizes, the effects of bed-
forms on shear stress zoning and on bed-load movement itself (e.g. downstream migration of
sand bed-forms), the high spatial variability of local tractive forces applied on the bed surface
owing to spatial segregation in grain sizes, deformation in local ﬂow gradients, bed undulation,
and various features associated with channel conﬁgurations, such as meander bends, dunes,
bars, etc. There are also signiﬁcant practical hurdles related to the calculation of the moving
distance of individual grains and the spatial and temporal scales at which these convoluted
problems need to be addressed.
Bed-load transport is a vastly spatially and temporally inconsistent phenomenon, and the func-
tions that correspond ﬂow intensity to bed load demonstrate this variability. Such relations have
an uncertainty that can be reﬂected in some orders of magnitude (Gomez and Church, 1989).
This uncertainty originates partially from the highly local and unsteady nature of the driving
forces but is also connected to varying rates of sediment supply from upstream, the conﬁgura-
tion and the river bed structure (Wilcock, 2001; Di Cristo et al., 2006; Greco et al., 2012).
The recently developed sediment transport models are not as comprehensive as a hydraulic engi-
neer desires. According to Papanicolaou et al. (2008), some of the limitations of most sediment

20
Introduction
transport models are as follows:
(I) Under the assumption that sediment entrainment is triggered by the excess shear stress in-
stead of the near-bed ﬂow turbulent characteristics, shear stress, in most entrainment formulas
is determined by assuming uniform ﬂow conditions (Gomez and Church, 1989; Almedeij and
Diplas, 2005). Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that turbulent sweeps, outward interac-
tions, and ejections are the main triggering mechanisms of sediment transport.
(II) The conventional approach in sediment transport models, for example, excess shear stress
models (settling velocity models) is to calculate the transport rate by using a single characteris-
tic grain size, such as the median (Raudkivi, 1998). It is likely that this approach underpredicts
or overpredicts the transport rate of individual fractions when bimodal or multimodal distribu-
tions are present on the river bed. The reason is that it does not account for differential transport
of sediment particles with a different size or density.
(III) Most multidimensional models deal with ﬂow and sediment processes as entirely uncou-
pled or semi-coupled within one computational time step (or even during a sequence of time
steps in some cases). Thus, the effect of changes in bed elevation and bed material size distri-
bution on the ﬂow ﬁeld can be considered approximately.
Although bed load transport equations are abundant and used extensively in both applied and
theoretical studies, acute testing of such equations in the literature remains limited. Testing the
predictive abilities of these formulae over intermediate temporal scales (approximately decadal)
and spatial scales (a length of at least several kilometers) remains noticeably more demanding
due to lack of ﬁeld data on bed load transport rates at these levels. According to Wilcock
(2001), the absence of sufﬁcient ﬁeld data to analyze bed load transport complexities (e.g.
variability) is identiﬁed as the crucial reason why the expectation to obtain the high predictive
power of equations under selected conditions cannot be satisﬁed. According to Gomez and
Church (1989), there are more bed load equations in existence than there are reliable data to test
them.
To sum up, there is no consensus among researchers in the literature on the selected methods,
concerning choice of the best representative equation, since each equation has its limitations and
the range of application within the selected data set (Martin, 2003; Sinnakaudan et al., 2006).
These challenges hinder a simple model selection for a less experienced engineer.
1.6 Goals of this Study
An issue in many hydro-morphodynamic studies is the determination of the best model that de-
scribes the morphodynamic condition of a river in any modeling exercise. It is widely accepted

1.7 Outline
21
that no model can be labeled as ideal for the range of existing morphodynamic conditions.
Evaluating the relative performance of competing models can often be challenging given the
limited available data. Another complication stems from difﬁculties in obtaining a unique set
of the model parameters. The choice of model parameters demands a substantial degree of
expertise from end-users to adapt the model to their application correctly. Hence, a necessity
of a framework that allows the modeler to rank different available models according to their
capability of future predictions is obvious.
To respond to the mentioned necessity, the present thesis is aimed in constructing a Bayesian
model selection framework and to evaluate its applicability in the selection of the most suitable
hydro-morphodynamic numerical model. Bayesian model selection uses concepts of proba-
bility theory and numerical integration to obtain a model ranking. The proposed framework is
aimed at providing objective guidance in model selection to assist even less experienced users in
related engineering and management questions by reducing the professional expertise required
for manual calibration.
The description of speciﬁc goals follows below.
I: To design the framework as a programming routine in Python 2.7 that ranks the compet-
ing hydro-morphodynamic models, digitalized by Telemac2D-Sisyphe, after their assessments
according to the Bayes’ theory.
II: To evaluate the framework using test cases considering different available variants of a
hydro-morphodynamic model in Telemac2D-Sisyphe.
1.7 Outline
The structure of present thesis titled "Bayesian Model Selection for Hydro-morphodynamic
Models" entails acknowledgments, thesis’ declaration and abstract; also, lists of content, ﬁgures
and tables, nomenclature, the six main chapters, annexes, and the bibliography.
Chapter 1 is devoted to the introduction of this thesis that brieﬂy contains the deﬁnition and
main features of hydro-morphodynamics, an overview of hydro-morphodynamic modeling, ad-
vancement of sediment calculations, followed by the performed studies on model comparisons
to shed some light on the performance of each sediment transport equation. All the information
has been derived through citations taken from research articles. Further, it addresses the restric-
tions and challenges of hydro-morphodynamic model selection. The last section of this chapter
explains how the present study intends to overcome these challenges as goals deﬁnition.

22
Introduction
Chapter 2 discloses the main features of hydro-morphodynamic models. First, it provides the
description of governing equations, computational modules setup within the initial and bound-
aries conditions, and the numerical solution proposed by the Telemac-2d-Sisyphe. The second
section of this chapter presents a detailed study of selected sediment transport equations imple-
mented in this study. Then, the chapter continues with the description of the two considered case
studies. This description entails the geometry, the boundary conditions, and the measurement
data.
Chapter 3 describes the methodology of the current study. It introduces the mathematical def-
initions and explanations of the method for calculation of Bayesian Model Evidence (BME)
according to the Bayesian theory, which serves as the basis for the selection of competing
hydro-morphodynamic models. Also, it comprises the introduction of a stochastic model re-
duction technique, called "Response Surface," and how it shows the dependence of each model
on the parameter space using few of its evaluations. Additionally, the Bayesian updating to
improve the response surfaces is presented. At last, bootstrap ﬁltration is enclosed, which sieve
poorly performed parameter sets from the rest.
Chapter 4 entails the setups and the results of Bayesian model selection (BMS) for the channel
bend experiment of Yen and Lee (1995). Furthermore, it covers the assessment of the parameter
behavior of the individual hydro-morphodynamic model as well as uncertainty investigation of
the selected evaluated morphodynamic models.
Chapter 5 presents BMS for the second examined case study, namely the numerical model of
the 10-km stretch of the lower Rhine with two different scenarios. First section includes the
settings and results for a benchmarked test case using synthetic measurements, also known as
Twin Experiment. Then, the results for a real scenario; i.e. using the authentic two-year period
measurements for calibration and validation steps is given in the second section.
Chapter 6 summaries the thesis, and presents the conclusions of the present study, followed by
some suggestions for future research work.

2 Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
In morphodynamic modeling of river systems, empirical relations (models) normally calculate
the entrainment, transport, and deposition of sediment to derive morphological changes, i.e.
river bed evolution. These models can be computationally demanding because the boundaries of
the ﬂow ﬁeld can vary owing to the coupling between ﬂow ﬁeld and channel morphology, which
entails frequent re-computation of ﬂow conditions. Moreover, the aforementioned empirical
models are abundant, and this creates a great challenge for the modeler in the selection of the
most appropriate model, which can simulate the real behavior of the river.
The following chapter starts with a description of the hydro-morphodynamic model (Telemac-
2d-Sisyphe) in Section 2.1, followed by a detailed study of the selected bed-load transport
equations in Section 2.2. Subsequently, the description of the selected case studies to be im-
plemented in the Bayesian selection framework, is presented. It must be noted that we restrict
ourselves to the channels with ﬁxed banks, carrying non-cohesive sediment. First, a test case
model of a channel bend, based on an experiment done by Yen and Lee is described in Section
2.3. At last, Section 2.4 addresses the real river case study of the river Rhine.
2.1 Hydro-Morphodynamic Model
The hydro-morphodynamic model used in this study has been built in the TELEMAC-
MASCARET (www.telemac.org) simulation software, which is an open-source integrated suite
of solvers for simulation in the ﬁeld of free surface ﬂow (Hervouet, 2000). It is the product
of a consortium of core organizations: Artelia (formerly Sogreah, France), Bundesanstalt für
Wasserbau (BAW, Germany), Centre d’Etudes Techniques Maritimes et Fluviales (CETMEF,
France), Daresbury Laboratory (United Kingdom), Electricité de France R&D (EDF, France),
and HR Wallingford (United Kingdom).
The modules used in this study are as follows: (I) The hydrodynamic module (TELEMAC-
2D) that focuses on free-surface maritime or river hydraulics. (II) The morphodynamic module

(SISYPHE) that is part of the hydro-informatic ﬁnite element system (TELEMAC) and de-
scribes sediment transport processes and the resulting changes in the riverbed. These two mod-
ules are internally coupled, i.e. the relevant hydrodynamic variables are exchanged between
hydrodynamic and morphodynamic modules. The technical set-up of the modules and their
speciﬁcations are summarized in the subsequent section.
2.1.1 Governing Equations
Shallow Water Equations: The hydrodynamic module (TELEMAC-2D) solves the shallow
water equations also known as Saint Venant equations, which is the depth-integrated derivation
of the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain under the condition that horizontal
scale is much greater than vertical length scale.

where h denotes water depth (m). u,v are ﬂow velocities in x- and y directions, respectively
(m/s), Z is free surface elevation (m), and Sh is source or sink of ﬂuid (m/s). Sx,Sy represent
source or sink terms in dynamic equations (m/s2), and ϑt is momentum coefﬁcient (m2/s). In
Equation 2.1, the variables h,u and v are unknown, and they are in Cartesian coordinate system
(Lang, 2010).
Bed Shear Stress: In the momentum equation in Equation 2.1, the bed shear stress is repre-
sented as a source or a sink term of momentum (Sx,Sy) within the domain. In the sediment
transport processes, the bed shear stress plays a major role and, it is calculated by:

Bottom Evolution: Near-bed ﬂow ﬁelds govern local rates of sediment transport. These ﬂow
ﬁelds are mostly ruled by the bottom topography and the changes in bed evolution. To calculate
the bed evolution, the morphodynamic module, SISYPHE, solves the Exner equation:
(1−n)∂Zf
∂x +∇.Qb = 0 ,
(2.4)
where n is the non-cohesive bed porosity, Zf is the bed evolution, and Qb is the volume of
sediment transport (bed-load) per unit width (m2s−1). Equation 2.4 speciﬁes that variation
of sediment bed thickness can be computed from a simple mass balance and it is plausible
for equilibrium conditions (Tassi, 2014). The detailed study of considered sediment transport
formulae that predict the bed load is presented in Section 2.2.
Bed Slope Effect: Slanting riverbed leads to an increase of bed load transport rate in the downs-
lope direction, and to a reduction of the rate in upslope bed load direction. Accounting for the
bed slope effect, we can implement a correction of sediment transport rate to the magnitude as
well as the direction of the transport via the Soulsby’s formula (Equation 2.5).
θc

(2.5)
This formula makes a correction in the critical shear stress θco as a function of bed slope χ,
angle of repose of the sediment φs, and angle of current to upslope direction ψ with θc the mod-
iﬁed threshold bed shear stress. Moreover, the modiﬁcation of sediment-transport-rate direction
owing to the slope bed effect is taken into account by:
tanα = tanδ −T ∂Zf
∂n ,
(2.6)
where α is the angle between the direction of solid transport and the ﬂow direction, δ is the
direction of bottom stress in relation to the ﬂow direction, and n ,here, is the coordinate along the
axis perpendicular to the ﬂow. The deviation coefﬁcient (T) is calculated according to Talmon
et al. (1995) and depends on the Shields parameter and an empirical coefﬁcient (parameter of
deviation) β2:

Secondary Current Effects: Direction of bed load movement diverges from the main ﬂow
direction because of helical ﬂow effect. Engelund (1974) proposed an expression to account for
this fact based on the assumption that the mean water depth, the bed roughness, and the bottom
shear stress are constant in the cross-section. According to this formula, the angle between bed
load movement and main ﬂow direction is deﬁned as:
δ = 7h
r ,

In the morphodynamic module (SISYPHE), there is a possibility of the introduction of a new
sediment transport formula in addition to the existing equations. This user-deﬁned equation
can be added as a new subroutine to the Fortran ﬁle used in SISYPHE. Further information
about the computational procedures of TELEMAC-2D and SISYPHE modules is available in
Hervouet (2007) and Tassi (2014), respectively.

After a thorough review of the literature, six widely used sediment transport predictors are
selected for detailed investigation.
• Meyer-Peter and Müller formula (1948)

introduced as d50, which is a diameter for which 50% of grains are larger. Moreover, the

with the correction factor for skin friction µ, and the bottom shear stress τ0.
2.2.1 Meyer-Peter and Müller Formula (1948)
Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948) formulated an empirical equation for prediction of bed load
transport in open channel ﬂows. Their formula is one of the most commonly used bed load
predictors.
In 1934, Meyer-Peter, Favre, and Einstein introduced a relationship to estimate the transport
rate of uniform grains of gravel. In their experimental investigations, only two grains sizes of
gravel with diameters of 5.05 mm and 28.60 mm were considered. The proposed relationship is
as follows:
q2/3
b
= 250q2/3I −42.5ds ,
(2.12)
in which qb represents bed load transport rate per unit width (kg/s.m), q is water discharge
per unit width (m3/s.m), ds is the diameter of bed material (m), and I is the slope of the chan-
nel. However, this equation is not applicable to the majority of alluvial streams, because it is
restricted to rivers with rather coarse uniform materials. Therefore, they extended their experi-
ments to include non-uniform and smaller sediment grains.
Formulation of the transport Equation: Meyer-Peter and Müller (1984) developed the fol-
lowing empirical equation for bed load transport of non-uniform particles, using a wider range
of data and the outputs of the previous studies:
(ns/n)2/3RbI
(s−1)dm
= 0.047+0.25ρ1/3(qb/ρs)2/3/
h
(γs −γ)1/3i
dm ,
(2.13)
where n and ns are Manning coefﬁcients deﬁned by v = 1
nRb2/3I1/2, v = 1
nsRb2/3I′1/2, respec-
tively. ns is calculated by:
ns = d1/6
90 /26 ,
(2.14)
in which d90 is the grain size for which 90% of sediments are ﬁner.
Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948) discovered that the total shear stress is not accountable for
sediment transport in the presence of an undulated bed; a part of the shear stress, however,
is consumed to overcome the form resistance, and the bed load transport is a function of the
remaining part. Thus, they divided the slope I as I = I′ +I′′, where I′ is the portion of the total
energy slope required to overcome the grains’ resistance and induce bed load motion, and I′′ is
the rest of the energy slope needed to overpower bed undulation resistance.

Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
Einstein (1950) divided the hydraulic radius into two parts instead of one slope, then the rela-
tionship between the two parts of the hydraulic radius can be derived from:
R

b =
ns
n
3/2

(2.15)
where R

b represents the hydraulic radius due to grain resistance.
Equation 2.13 can be
rewritten, using Equation 2.15 as:
Φb =



0
if θ
′ < θc
αmpm(θ
′ −θc)
3
2
otherwise
,
(2.16)
with αmpm a coefﬁcient (= 8 by default), θc the dimensionless critical Shields parameter (= 0.047
by default). The characteristic sand grain diameter was originally chosen to d64 by Meyer-Peter
and Müller. This classical bed-load formula has been validated for coarse sediments in the range
0.4mm < d50 <29.0mm, and it is based on the concept of initial entrainment. The Equation 2.16
has basically the same form as du Boys (1879) formula in the sense that the transport rate is
related to an effective shear stress (θ
′ −θc).
Advantages and Disadvantages: Most of the data used in the calibration of Meyer-Peter-
Müller’s formula were obtained from ﬂows with little or no suspended load and for coarse
sands and gravels. Hence, it is suggested that this procedure should be used for the similar ﬂow
and sediment conditions.
Equation 2.16 gives zero bed-load transport for θ
′ of 0.047. This implies that there is no sedi-
ment transport for values less than 0.047 and motion of the bed material begins when θ
′ reaches
the value of 0.047. Therefore, according to Meyer-Peter and Müller the dimensionless critical
shear stress(θc) has a constant value of 0.047, and the quantity (θ
′ −0.047) is regarded as the
effective or extra shear stress responsible for bed load transport. However, Misri et al. (1984),
in their experimental studies, found that bed load transport is not zero even for 0.047. This is
due to the fact that the critical dimensionless shear stress for smaller particles is not constant
and is signiﬁcantly smaller than 0.047, as can be seen from the Shields’ diagram. The reason
that Meyer-Peter and Müller reached a constant value of 0.047 for θc is that they used mainly
large particle sizes in their experimental studies.
2.2.2 Einstein-Brown Formula (1950)
The Einstein-Brown bed-load equation is a modiﬁcation of Einstein Formula (1942). The Ein-
stein theory has been described in detail in various studies, e.g. Yalin (1977); Raudkivi (1998);

2.2 Detailed Study of Selected Equations
29
Simons and Sentuerk (1977); Graf (1971); Garde and Ranga Raju (1977), and Vanoni (2006).
Therefore, in the following section, only a short description of the theoretical concept is pre-
sented.
The methods employed in Einstein’s formula (1942) to predicting bed and suspended load are
different. His renowned bed-load function is based on physical principles and probability theo-
ries, whereas, suspended sediment transport is calculated from a deterministic approach through
the depth integration of the product of local concentration and ﬂow velocity. However, the
computation of suspended load is affected by the bed-load through the injection of reference
concentration from the bed-load function into the suspended sediment integration.
In his bed-load function, Einstein regarded the bed load transport as the movement of sediment
particles in a thin layer with the thickness of two times of the particle diameter exactly above
the bed. The ﬂuctuating lifting force transfers these grains by saltation, and then the particles
jump a longitudinal distance of approximately 100 particle diameters. The jumping length was
assumed to be autonomous of the hydraulic conditions and associated with the sediment size.
The Einstein theory is based on dividing the bed material mixture into several size classes.
Firstly, the transport rate of each size class is computed, and then the total sediment discharge
is calculated by adding the individual rates. The method results in complex and burdensome
computations; nevertheless, the procedures are unambiguous.
The main difference between the Einstein’s method of bed-load calculation and the previously
published methods of du Boys (1879), and Meyer-Peter and Müller (1948) is that Einstein
did not utilize any concept for the incipient motion of sediment. Furthermore, the bed-load
transport in Einstein theory is associated with the ﬂuctuations of turbulence rather than to the
average values of the forces that are exerted on the sediment particles by the ﬂow.
Einstein’s bed-load formula incorporates all relevant variables of water and sediment transport,
yet, the method has not produced acceptable accuracy in most applied river engineering projects
because the experimental data obtained in the laboratory was only used in the calibration.

Einstein assumes that the probability f to be some function of particle weight over the average

and Ψ. He proposed A = 0.465, and B = 0.391 by ﬁtting with measurement data:
f(θ
′) = exp(−0.391/θ
′) .
(2.18)
Numerous sediment transport researchers modiﬁed Einstein’s stochastic model, and similar
equations were developed. However, Rouse, Boyer and Laursen have developed one of the
most popular modiﬁcations of Einstein’s formula, which is known as the Einstein-Brown rela-
tionship (Brown, 1950). In this correction, Brown (1950) ﬁtted a new curve to Einstein’s data,
with the function of f(x) = x−3, instead of f(x) = exp(−x), Brown’s curve was as follows:
f(θ
′) = 40(θ
′)
3 .
(2.19)
It is believed that his curve applies well for high value of bed shear stress θ
′.
How-
ever, Einstein’s and Brown’s curves are often used together, forming the Einstein-Brown
bed load equation. This formula is presented in Equation 2.19, which is recommendable for
gravel (d50 > 2mm), and large bed shear stress (θ > θc). The solid transport rate is expressed as:
Φs = F(D∗)f(θ

The Einstein-Brown equation is rather closer to reality for low θ (large Ψ) than DuBoys and
other excess shear models, because it shows some transport for θ < θc, while excess shear
models show none. A major drawback of the Einstein-Brown formulation, however, is that
there are no bed-form effects.

2.2.3 Modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen Formula by Chollet & Cunge
(1980)
Engelund and Hansen (1967) assumed that there was a deﬁnite relationship between the rate of
sediment discharge and the energy dissipation of the ﬂow. They introduced a new approach for
the prediction of transport rate of total bed material load. Data from four suites of experiments
in a large laboratory ﬂume were used to calibrate the proposed equation. Due to the limitation
in data for calibration, the formula is recommended for ﬁne sediments, in the range 0.15mm <
d50 < 1.00mm. Furthermore, the equation is a function of mean ﬂow velocity, water surface
slope, hydraulic radius, the median diameter of bed material mixture, and relative density of
sediment particles.
Engelund and Hansen’s research is based on a simple transport mechanism in dune bed area,
where sediment particles are eroded from the stream-side and deposited on the lee side of the
dunes. They propose that the moving sediment in the presence of dune beds is raised to a
height equivalent to the dune height (h). The energy (per unit time and width) needed for this
action can be expressed as (ρs −ρ)gqth, where qt represents the volumetric transport rate of
bed material per unit width of the channel.
Formulation of the transport Equation: Assuming that the particle velocity is proportional to
the friction or the shear velocity u∗=


, and the effective shear stress (τ
′ −τc), which is
transferred from the ﬂuid to the moving grains, Engelund and Hansen developed the following
equation:
(ρs −ρ)gqth = α(τ

τ0
ρ

(2.21)
where τc denotes critical bed shear stress at which the bed material particles start to move, τ
′
is bed shear stress due to the grain roughness only, L is length of the dune, τ0 stands for ﬂow
shear stress at the bed, and α is a dimensionless coefﬁcient to be determined experimentally.
Equation 2.21 can be rearranged to derive the following:

bed, derivable from Darcy-Weisbach equation for open channel ﬂows, f = 2g×(4R) I
V 2, where
R is the hydraulic radius of ﬂow cross section, and V is average ﬂow velocity.
Dimensionless forms of τ
′, and τc can be written as following, using the deﬁnition of the

expression θ

′2. Therefore, the transport equation becomes:
fΦs = const.×θ ∗5/2 .
(2.26)
The validity of a transport formula of this type is tested by comparison with four sets of exper-
iments in a large laboratory ﬂume, reported in Guy et. al. (1966), and the calibrated form of
Equation 2.26 is:
Φs = 0.1×θ
′5/2 .
(2.27)
Advantages and Disadvantages: Engelund and Hansen’s derivation is directly based on bed
load transport phenomenon. Their initial assumption (the sediments are elevated to the dune
height in the presence of a dune bed) is valid when only bed-load particles are considered.
However, this assumption is used for developing total load equation, which includes both bed
and suspended loads.
Another questionable assumption is that the particle velocity, for the whole sediment material
in transport, is proportional to the bed shear velocity u∗. This hypothesis is also typically
applicable to the bed-load particulate matters and cannot describe the velocity of suspended
solids properly. In general, the velocity of suspended particles in the direction of the ﬂow is
strictly proportional to the velocity of the surrounding ﬂuid (Bagnold, 1966; Toffaleti, 1969;
Van Rijn, 1984).

2.2 Detailed Study of Selected Equations
33
Moreover, the dimensionless critical shear velocity (θ
′
c), is replaced with a constant value of
0.06. Nonetheless, this value is not constant, according to Shields (1936), and is function of
both ﬂow and sediment characteristics, such as bed shear velocity u∗, kinematic viscosity of
ﬂow ν, ﬂow density ρ, sediment density ρs, and particle size ds. Conversely, the constant value
of (θ
′
c) is only applicable for the large particle size, where boundary Reynolds number (R∗) is
nearly greater than 100, i.e. for particles which typically move within the bed load layer.
Modiﬁcation of the Engelund-Hansen Formula: The classic method of Engelund and Hansen
(1967) has been revised by Chollet and Cunge (1980) to rectify the drawback of the dimension-
less critical Shield’s parameter (θ
′
c), to account for different transport regimes, and to suggest a
threshold for incipient motion of sediment particles. The proposed formulation is as following:
qt = 0.05fn

k2H1/3θ 5/2

(2.28)
where fn is the fraction in the bed of sediment class n, and K is the Strickler coefﬁcient. More-
over, the Strickler coefﬁcient can be replaced by setting k2H1/3 equal to g/CD, in which the
bottom drag coefﬁcient (CD) can be derived using the following equation:
CD =

κ
ln(zb/z0)

or
CD =

(2.29)
Here, κ is the Von Karman constant, zb represents the height of the ﬁrst velocity node above
the bed, z0 is the roughness height (or skin roughness length deﬁned in the sediment transport
model), and H the total water depth.
Considering the Equation 2.10 for non-dimensional current-induced sand transport rate (Φs),
the bottom drag coefﬁcient (CD), the modiﬁed version of Engelund-Hansen formula can be
expressed as:
Φs = 0.1

2.2.4 Van Rijn Formula (1984)
van Rijn (1984) develops his bed-load equation based on the product of the saltation height, the
representative velocity of bed-load particles, and the concentration of sediment materials in the
bed layer. Moreover, in his later researches, he proposes an approach to estimate suspended load
via the depth integration of the product of the vertical proﬁles of ﬂow velocity and sediment
concentration, and a simpliﬁed procedure for computation of sediment loads. His equations
are mostly based on a revision of existing equations implementing numerical and regression
analysis techniques with plenty of ﬁeld and lab data.
Formulation of the Transport Equation: According to van Rijn (1984), in the bed-load trans-
port, the particles are displaced by rolling, and saltating along the bed surface. The transport
rate (qb) of the bed load is deﬁned as the following:
Qb = ub δb cb ,
(2.32)
where ub is the particle velocity, δb the saltation height, and the bed-load concentration is de-
noted by cb. By numerically solving the equation of the motion for a spherical saltating particle,
the following relationships for calculation of the saltation height (δb), and the particle velocity
(ub):

(2.33)
Here, dimensionless particle diameter (D∗) and dimensionless transport stage parameter (T) can
be calculated from the following equations (Ackers and Rodney White, 1973; Yalin, 1963):
D∗= D50 ×

T = (u

The critical shear velocity (u∗,cr) according to Shields can be obtained from:
u∗,cr =

(ρs
ρ −1)×gD50 ×θcr
0.5
.
(2.35)
In addition, Van Rijn used Chezy formula to compute bed shear velocity related to grains (u

deﬁned as:
u

∗=
√g
c


× ¯u ,
(2.36)

2.2 Detailed Study of Selected Equations
35
in which c
′ is Chezy-coefﬁcient related to grains, ¯u is mean ﬂow velocity.
Van Rijn assumes that bed-load transport can be deﬁned accurately as a function of two di-
mensionless parameters D∗and T. By analyzing 130 sets of measured bed load transport in
laboratory ﬂumes, with particle diameters ranging from 0.2 mm to 2.0 mm, he shows that the
bed load concentration Cb can be derived through:
Qb
q
g(s−1)d503 = 0.053 T 2.1
D0.3
∗
or
Φs = 0.053 T 2.1
D0.3
∗
.
(2.37)
Equation 2.33 is dimensionally homogeneous and provides the bed-load transport rate Qb per
unit width of channel in volumetric ratio. The equation has been veriﬁed with 580 datasets from
bed-load transport in experimental ﬂumes and natural rivers carrying sand sediment particles.
Van Rijn concludes that the results demonstrate that near 77% of predicted bed load discharges
are within 0.5 - 2.0 times of the measured transport rates.
Advantages and Disadvantages: One advantage of Van Rijn’s theory is that the energy slope
(or water surface) has been removed from the sediment transport rate computations. Energy
slope is one of the most signiﬁcant variables that inﬂuences all the physical characteristics of
open channel ﬂows. Nonetheless, it is rather sensitive to minor changes in water surface eleva-
tion, which are not simply determined, and its measurement, especially for natural rivers during
the ﬂood events, is utterly demanding. The replacement of energy slope via Chezy formula
sounds rational for large-scale natural streams. On the other hand, for experimental ﬂumes and
small-scale streams, this alternative is irrelevant and may inject errors into the computations, be-
cause in such cases, the conditions are controlled and measurement of the water surface slope is
manageable (Habibi, 1994). What is more, the proposed expressions of bed-load transport rate,
i.e. Equation 2.37 is valid for the sand grains (diameter between 0.2 mm and 2.0 mm). How-
ever, in natural streams with high energy slope, near-bed grains mostly include gravel particles,
which are larger than 2.0 mm of diameter.
2.2.5 Hunziker Formula (1995)
The formula of Hunziker (1995) is an adaptation of the Meyer-Peter Müller formula to account
for fractional transport calibrated with the experiments of Gunter (1971) and Suzuki and Hano
(1991) with grain diameters from 0.9 to 4.0 mm. The principle of this transport function is the
concept of same incipient motion for all sediments. As per all sediment formulae that assume
threshold conditions for the onset of erosion, the transport within the idea of this method only
initiates if the dimensionless shear stress of the ﬂow is greater than the dimensionless threshold.

36
Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
According to Parker (1992) and Wilcock (1992), the transport model was selected to be surface
based, and the transport capacity of each fraction is calculated as a function of the mean grain
size of the surface layer. This procedure ensures incipient motion of all grains at the same
threshold value.
The model applies the mixing layer concept suggested by Hirano (1971), in which the mixing
layer is supposed to be equal to the surface layer. It was concluded that using the basic structure
of the MPM formula, and multiplication of the excess shear stress with the hiding function,
the identical mobility condition for the mobile armor case was satisﬁed without any further
correction. The applied structure differs from previous approaches, where either the total shear
stress or the critical shear stress are corrected by the hiding function (Sutherland, 1992).
Formulation of the Transport Equation:The basic structure of the transport equation for a
fraction in a dimensionless form is expressed by:
Φb = p1 ×8
h
ϕi(θ
′
dms −θcdms)
i1.5
,
(2.38)
in which pi is the fraction of class i in the surface or mixing layer. The dimensionless Shields
factor referred to the mean surface grain size is deﬁned by:
θ
′
dms =
τ
′
0
ρg(s−1)dm
(2.39)
where τ
′
0 represents the reduced bed shear stress accounting for bed form losses. The modiﬁed
critical Shield’s parameter for any grain class within the surface is determined by:
θcdms = θcr
dmo
dm
0.33
,
(2.40)
where θcr the critical Shields parameter (θcr = 0.047), dm and dmo are the mean grain size of
the surface layer and subsurface layer in meter, respectively.
The hiding function (ϕi) is computed using:
ϕi =
 di
dm
−α
,
(2.41)
with di the grain size of class i and α is a constant.
Hunziker (1995) states that, in the particular case of uniform bed sediment, the procedure used
in the Meyer-Peter Müller (MPM) formula to correct for bed forms led to a signiﬁcantly large
form drag. The reason for this is the inaccurate parameterization of skin friction implemented
in MPM formula; namely, Kr = 26/D1/6
90 . This result is in accordance with the earlier results
of Jaeggi (1984), Smart and Jaeggi (1983). According to Jaeggi (1984), the parameter kr had

2.2 Detailed Study of Selected Equations
37
been calibrated using the Nikuradse (1933) tests and the effect of form roughness evidently
overestimated during the development of the original MPM formula. In light of this ﬁnding,
Hunziker (1995) used an alternative bed-form correction proposed by Yalin and Scheuerlein
(1988). The intention of this correction was to account not only for bed-form effects, but to
consider also the effect of moving particles in bed-load transport. As a result, Hunziker (1995)
derived the following improved MPM relation,

form correction of Yalin and Scheuerlein (1988) instead of the original bed-form correction
considered by Meyer-Peter and Müller.
Equation 2.36 involves reducing the coefﬁcient 8 to a value of 5, in comparison to the original
equation of Meyer-Peter and Müller (Equation 2.16), taking into account the form roughness by
an appropriate relation, and discarding the parameter (ks/kr)1.5. In Equation 2.42, the value of
the parameter, representing critical shear stress has been marginally raised from 0.047 to 0.05.
However, this value is constant only for hydraulically rough conditions.
Using the new constant in the MPM expression (Equation 2.27), the volumetric sediment trans-
port for each sediment class presented in Equation 2.23 is replaced by:
Φs = p1 ×5

(2.43)
As mentioned before, the critical Shields parameter is calculated as a function of the dimen-
sionless mean grain size D∗. It is worth noting that according to Hunziker, stability problems
may occur outside the parameter range α ≤2.30, and di/dm ≥0.25.
Advantages and Disadvantages: The valuable conclusion of Hunziker (1995); i.e. MPM for-
mula over-corrected for form drag, is, however, incomplete and obscured by additional factors,
such as α. It is incomplete in the sense that it speciﬁes that some form of correction for form
drag, the one according to Yalin and Scheuerlein (1988), is still required even for data without
bed forms, which does not hold according to Wong and Parker (2006).
2.2.6 Wu Formula (2000)
This equation is particularly recommended for the calculation of graded sediment since, in its
derivation, the different fractions were explicitly implemented. In Wu et al. (2000), the authors

38
Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
argue that the hiding and exposure effect in the modeling of non-uniform sediment transport
needs to be considered. The argument stems from the fact that the coarse particles on the
bed in non-uniform sediment movement are readily entrapped in comparison with the uniform
sediment of equal sizes, due to a higher possibility of exposure to the ﬂow.
In their study, they assumed that sediment particles have a spherical shape with different diam-
eters as shown in Figure 2.1, and deﬁned the exposure height ∆i, for a particle with diameter di,
as the height difference between the apexes of particle and its upstream neighbor. The particle
di is regarded as being at exposed state, if ∆i > 0, otherwise it is at hidden state.
Figure 2.1: Deﬁnition of the exposure height (Wu et al. 2000)
∆i is a random variable, due to randomly sediment particle distribution on the bed, and assumed
to follow a uniform probability distribution f, expressed by:
f =

−dj ≤∆i ≤di

.
(2.44)
The probability of particles dj residing in the front of particles di can be assumed to be the
total rate of fraction of particles di in the bed material, pb j. Thus, the total hidden and exposed
probabilities of particles di, can be obtained by:
phi =
N
∑

(2.45)
where N denotes the total number of particle size fractions of non-uniform sediment mixtures,
phi and pei are the total hiding and exposing probabilities of particles di. They show in their

study that there is a correlation of phi + pei = 1 between phi and pei. This correlation can be
deﬁned via the hiding and exposure factor using laboratory and ﬁeld data:
ξi =
 pei

−0.6
.
(2.46)
An expression for determining the critical bed shear stress for incipient motion of non-uniform
sediment was derived by introducing the hiding and exposure factor in Equation 2.46:
τci
γc −γ = θc
 pei
phi
−0.6
,
(2.47)
where τci is the critical shear stress for particle di in non-uniform sediment mixtures, and θc is
interpreted as the non-dimensional critical shear stress for the related uniform sediment or the
mean size of bed materials. Using ﬁeld and laboratory data, θc was determined to be equal 0.03.
The authors adopted the threshold equation suggested by Parker et al. (1983) for the incipient
motion of non-uniform sediment as the reference transport threshold to ascertain the critical
shear stress,
W ∗
ri = qbi (ρs/ρ −1) g
pbi u3∗
,
(2.48)
where W ∗
ri represents a reference transport parameter, qbi is the volumetric bed load transport
rate of the fraction i per unit width, and pbi shows the gradation of the fraction i of bed material.
Characteristic parameters and relationship: The type of formulas, which relate the bed load
transport rate of non-uniform bed-load to the excess shear stress (τb −τc), can be written as:
Φb = f3
τb
τc
−1

,
(2.49)
where Φb is a non-dimensional bed-load transport rate, qb is the bed load transport rate per unit
width, and τb is the total bed shear stress due to grain roughness. By extending Equation 2.49,
the non-dimensional fractional bed load transport rate Φbi is deﬁned as:
Φbi =
qbi
pbi
q
g(s−1)di3 ,
(2.50)
in which qbi denotes the transport rate of the ith fraction of bed load per unit width (m2/s).
The bed shear stress is calculated by τb = γ Rb J, where Rb is the hydraulic radius of channel
bed, and J is the energy slope. However, the bed load transport corresponds only to the grain
shear stress τb
′, when sand ripples and dunes exist and is calculated by τb
′ = γ Rb
′ J, where Rb
′
is the hydraulic radius of the grain roughness on the bed. Therefore, the following expression
calculates the grain shear stress by using the Manning’s formula for uniform ﬂow:
τb

posure factor (Equation 2.46), and θm is the calculated shields parameter for dm. Finally, they
concluded that the proposed hiding and exposure correction factor could account for not only
the inﬂuence of sediment particle size but also that of bed-material gradation.
In conclusion, most of discussed formulae assume threshold conditions for the inception of
erosion (e.g. Meyer-Peter and Müller, and van Rijn). Other methods are based on similar energy
concept (e.g. Modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen) or can be a derivation from a statistical approach (e.g.
Einstein-Brown). Ultimately, the available formulae can be viewed merely as scale equations
of the ﬂow. On this account, it is perhaps not astonishing that so many variations have been
presented so far, and adjudicating their merits remains challenging. It is also noteworthy to
mention that the physics of bed load transport remains incompletely analyzed. Therefore, there
is no reason to postulate that any one of the existing formulae necessarily represents a complete
or even a close correlation with the measurements.

2.3 Channel Bend Model of Yen and Lee (1995)
41
2.3 Channel Bend Model of Yen and Lee (1995)
Yen and Lee (1995) conducted sets of experiments in a laboratory channel bend to investigate
bed topography and transverse sediment sorting in an alluvial channel bend under unsteady ﬂow
conditions with non-uniform sediment. Five experiments, with the same primary sediment-size
gradation but with dissimilar inﬂow hydrographs, were performed in an 180◦channel bend with
a constant radius of curvature. For the purpose of this study, we select the hydrograph of run
number 4 and the corresponding collected measurement data (Yen and Lee, 1995).
Model Geometry: The channel, illustrated in Figure 2.2 , is 1m wide and has a central angle of
180 degrees. Two straight reaches of 11.5 m long connect the channel to a stilling basin in the
upstream and a sediment-settling tank in downstream. A weir controls the water depth at the
downstream end to produce relatively uniform ﬂow along the bend with the base ﬂow discharge.
Before each run of the experiment began, a layer of sand around with thickness 20 cm and a
mean diameter of 1.0 mm had been placed on the bed.
Numerical Model: The numerical model of the bend channel embodies an unstructured, trian-
gular mesh with 709 nodes and 1050 elements to be solved by Finite Element Method (FEM)
as shown in in Figure 2.3.
Inﬂow Hydrograph: A triangular-shaped hydrograph was considered with the base ﬂow of
Qb f = 0.02 m3
s , and a peak discharge of Qpeak = 0.053 m3
s in a period of 300 minutes as shown
in Figure 2.4. The peak of the hydrograph applied in the present experiment was adjusted at
the point of the ﬁrst third of total duration. A sluice gate, whose opening was set at a step of 1
mm each time, manually operated the discharge. Additionally, a weir at the outﬂow controlled
a constant water depth of hbf = 5.44 cm and hpeak = 10.30 cm. Measurements of water levels
taken by point gauge at the upstream end revealed that the error of discharge laid within 20.5%
of the set values. (Yen and Lee, 1995)
Measurements: The results of the physical experiment are the measurements of bed topo-
graphic evolution, taken by point gauge. These results were obtained at the end of hydrograph,
for the run of experiments after termination of the ﬂow, and complete but gradual drainage of
water. These evolution measurements deﬁne the erosion and deposition of sediment near the
bed of the channel at the cross sections of 90 and 180 degrees of the bending channel after 300
minutes of time; normalized with the initial water depth h0 = 0.054 m.
As seen in Figure 2.5, the evolution proﬁles illustrate non-smooth slopes, which are proper of
nature systems, tools, and human errors. The representative cross-section in channels presents
a high sediment deposition in the inner bank and erosion in the outer bank. As indicated in Yen

and Lee (1995), this conﬁguration speciﬁcally occurs at 90◦, in which a higher slope of the bed
evolution and more deposition of sediment in the inner bank exist. However, the bed evolution
at the 180◦cross section clearly shows that a smoother slope and deeper scour depth emerged
in the outer bank.

2.4 The River Rhine Model
45
2.4 The River Rhine Model
Meandering channel sections present a particularly difﬁcult challenge for modeling sediment
transport. They are characterized by high levels of sedimentation on inside bends and erosion
on outside bends. The dynamic conditions in curved channels mean that the shape of the banks
and riverbed is constantly changing, thus inﬂuencing the ﬂow characteristics. This change may
affect especially the inland navigation and ﬂood situations.
Study area: The central reach of the Lower Rhine at Düsseldorf/Neuss (Rhine-km 739.0 to
Rhine-km 749.0, see Figure 2.6) is implemented as a complex hydro- and morphodynamic
model. An intense meandering with two close meandering curves and active bed-load transport
Figure 2.6: The Study area of the lower Rhine model (Source: Google Maps, 2017)
characterize this section of the river. In the ﬁrst upper-stream curvature, a mean radius of
approximately 800 m exist with a ﬂow section of 2.5 km; the counter-curvature is directly
connected with an average radius of approximately 600 m to 1.5 km of ﬂow section. A further
river curve follows, which has a much larger radius of 2.5 km and ends in a nearly straight river
course. The river stretch is about 400 m wide, and the width reduces to 220 m between the two
bends. Along the 10 km long section of the river, there is an average gradient of about 0.17
o/oo, which corresponds to a slope which is characteristic of the entire Rhine bottom (Messing,
2008).
The Rhine ﬂows freely in this section, i.e. neither in the upper nor lower stream is there a
congestion control by transverse structures. However, the morphology of the Lower Rhine is,

46

among other things, through the construction of the Rhine and the canalization of the tributaries
(for example, the Neckar and the Moselle) is profoundly affected. Additionally, for a long time
dumping and dredging of bed material has been performed to provide safe inland navigation.
Model Geometry: A comprehensive database was used to create the model geometry. In addi-
tion to laser scan data, information was also available on the groynes, longitudinal and bridge
structures in the study area. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) based on this data includes, in
addition to the main river channel, the adjacent ﬂoodplains to the dikes.
-Digital Terrain Model-Floodplain: The terrain model is based on aerial mapping data from
January 1997 (aerial mapping data of 639km-760km from 17.01.97 - BAW-97953). These
were available for the ﬂoodplain as a grid with a resolution of 1 m x 1 m.
-Digital Terrain Model-Main channel: The model geometry in the area of the river channel was
modeled based on the cross section proﬁle data from the year 2000 at a distance of 100 m each.
-Digital Terrain Model-Groynes: The position and height of the groynes were taken from the
groyne cadaster, plan data, and ﬂoodplain data.
Numerical Model: A two-dimensional numerical sediment transport model was established by
the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) as a component of the "ar-
tiﬁcial grain-feeding of bed material on the central Lower Rhine" project, aiming at improving
the efﬁciency of future hydrological design and optimizing the measures economically.
The numerical model of the 10 km Rhine section has an unstructured, triangulated grid with
41277 nodes and 81684 elements. The grid elements can be categorized into three groups. The
edge length in the riverbed is 10-15 m, while a ﬁner resolution of about 5-10 m was selected
for the groynes and banks. Moreover, the elements with an edge length of approximately 50
m represent the ﬂoodplains. The model was extended up- and downward by 500 m, to obtain
a stable ﬂow pattern in the inlet and outlet region. The terrain geometry was adopted, only the
groynes were removed manually in this 500 m. In this way, numerical instabilities, particularly
because of the groynes, are avoided at the inlet cross-section.
For the 2D model considered, the ﬂoodplains are ﬁrst deﬁned as "rigid bed." In these areas,
there can be no erosion of the original site. However, it is possible for material to deposit here,
for example, when the ﬂood is running off and is eroded again during a next ﬂood wave.
While the inlet and outlet cross-sections for the hydraulics (Telemac-2D) have been completely
opened, the bed load (Sisyphe) is only entered or discharged in the main river channel. In
this way, during a ﬂood, the whole ﬂow is not forced through the main channel, but can also
overﬂow the ﬂoodplains. Further, a so-called "equilibrium condition" realizes the entry of bed

load in the inlet cross-section, i.e. the theoretical transport rate on the edge nodes is calculated,
and the load is transported into the model area, but the height of the nodes remains unchanged.
Figure 2.7: Model boundaries, velocities, grid of the lower Rhine model (Source: Backhaus (2013))
Roughness: Different roughness zones were deﬁned for the model area (see Figure 2.8), to
determine the natural ﬂow resistance. Their spatial deﬁnition, as well as roughness value as-
signment, was carried out in the ﬂoodplain area using existing orthophotos and local approaches
taking into account the respective vegetation and surface conditions. In the river main channel,
different bottom samples could be used for the roughness coverage within the model area. Since
these samples showed only slight differences among one another, the entire ﬂow tube was pro-
vided with a similar roughness value. Thus, the roughness values deﬁned for the individual
zones as part of the model calibration. These ﬁve different zones categorize the domain of the
river stretch: the main channel, the ﬂoodplain, the groynes, the vegetation area and residence
area.
The Nikuradse roughness coefﬁcients, obtained in the calibration process, for all zones, are
presented in Table 2.1.

"SedDB"
(www.geoportal.bafg.de) offers the possibility to get an overview of the data collected
on the waterways and evaluated data of the soil samples, as well as impact and suspended
matter measurements. It also provides direct access to the parameters recorded in a variety
of measurement campaigns.
Within the framework of the "Erfolgskontrolle Geschiebebe-
wirtschaftung" (ECG), sampling is carried out on a regular basis (6 times per year) for the
detection of the bed and suspended matter load at the sites of the lower Rhine. These data
are subsequently entered into the SedDB. With the aid of the obtained knowledge, the grain
distribution and its variation within the model range could be analyzed. Within the framework
of the numerical investigations, a grain distribution averaged by the soil samples present in the
model area was used.
With the help of the natural measurement data already from the SedDB, a mean initial grain
distribution was established for the model area. This initial grain distribution, which is shown
in the numerical model according to Figure 2.9 were divided into ten fractions was the basis for
the subsequent study of different morphological and hydraulic parameters.
Morphological Factor: To ensure the comparability of the 2D models, these models are based
on an identical mesh grid. As the 10 km long model with 41277 nodes requires a considerably
large computational time, a new approach to reducing the computation time was implemented.
Wurms and Schröder (2012) reduced the required computation time by approximately the same

factor using the so-called morphological factor. The concept provides that the hydrograph is
compressed and a factor, that falls between 2 to 10, simultaneously multiplies the transport
rate. The results of the ﬁrst attempts to implement this approach also in the "Neuss-Düsseldorf"
model showed that deviations of up to 15% of the transport load occur in comparison to that of
the original model with no factor (Backhaus, 2013). Therefore, the approach of the morpholog-
ical factor is pursued further in this work.
Hydraulic Boundary Conditions: As the hydrodynamic boundary conditions, the discharge
values are set at the upstream model edge (inlet edge) and the water level at the downstream
model edge (outlet edge) in the control ﬁle. The inlet and outlet boundaries include the entire
through-ﬂow area (the river main channel as well as the ﬂoodplains). In the part of the inlet
side, the two control structures in nature have been removed within the ﬁrst 500 m. Due to
this undisturbed starting range, possible numerical instabilities should be prevented, and the
adjustment of a near-natural ﬂow situation should be made possible.
An important hydrological variable for the bed-load transport and thus for the erosion phenom-
ena is the discharge. This variable is determined for the boundaries of the investigation area
via a so-called key curve that describes a functional relationship between the water level of the
gauge Düsseldorf (Rhine-km 744.2) and the associated ﬂow (See Figure 2.10). The hydrograph
starts on 27th of June 2002 and ﬁnishes on the ﬁfth of May, 2004. The discharge data at the
inlet boundary were derived every one hour from the gauge located in Düsseldorf (See Figure
2.7). Then, these values have been delayed by minus 30 min, because the Düsseldorf gauge
is situated approximately 5.7 km downstream of the inlet edge.
The measurements at the
Büderich station (Rhein-km 749.5) can calculate the connection between discharge and trans-
port. The outlet water level data also originated from the 60 min values of the measurement
location Büderich, which is located at about 5.3 km upstream of the outlet edge. The water
level values are therefore shifted by plus 30min, and lowered down by 0.90 m (corresponds to
a slope gradient of 0.17 o/oo).

2.4 The River Rhine Model

52
Hydro-Morphodynamic Modeling
The hydrograph and water level, illustrated in Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11 are compressed by
a factor of four in time, to accelerate the simulation process (the real morphological values are
received in one-hour period).
Morphodynamic Boundary condition: The deﬁnition of the morphodynamic boundary con-
ditions occurs in the numerical model by assuming an equilibrium boundary condition at both
model edges (inlet and outlet edge).
The inlet boundary was deﬁned in such a way that only a bed-load entry occurs in the decisive
bedload carrying region within the main river channel because the transport quantities via the
ﬂoodplains are negligible and their detection in the model would lead to an overestimation of the
bed-load entry. On the lower model margin, on the other hand, the morphodynamic boundary
condition was determined according to the hydrodynamic boundary condition over the entire
through-ﬂow region.
Initial Conditions: A primary calculation was performed to calculate the initial hydrodynamic
conditions. A stationary calculation was carried out from an unvarying initial water level. The
hydrodynamic boundary conditions (inﬂow and water level) corresponded to the initial condi-
tions of the actual calculation. The stationary result subsequently served as initial hydrodynamic
conditions.
The determination of the initial morphodynamic conditions also took place using an initializa-
tion step. Assuming a uniform initial grain distribution within the entire model area, a morpho-
dynamic simulation was carried out over two years (2000 to 2002) to allow an adaptation of the
grain distribution to the local ﬂow and transport processes. A uniform grain size distribution
were used as initial distribution for the actual calculations.
Bed Evolution Measurements: For the hyrdo-morphodynamic calibration, hydraulic and mor-
phological data were available over a period of two years. These data set give information on
the river bed is given by the so-called "bed Eco-Sounding", which were available for the years
2000-2010 every two years. These elevation data, which have been measured for all hectome-
ter proﬁles of the investigation area, serve as a basis for the linear interpolation of the vertical
positions between the proﬁles.
The bed evolution from 2002 to 2004 is presented in Figure 2.12. The blue regions corre-
spond to the eroded areas and the deposition zones are presented with red color. Comparing the
measurements with every nodes in the unstructured grid of the numerical model is not useful,
because the bed evolution at a speciﬁc place for a speciﬁc time can not be predicted. How-
ever, the mean bed level change is obtainable with a certain reliability. Hence, an average bed
evolution for each 100 meters of river reach was taken into account.

Each measurement point is in the center of a region, whose dimensions correspond to a length
of 100 meters and the width of the river stretch. The measurement value is the river bottom
elevation from which the averaged bed morphological evolution over the analogous area is
computable. The averaged bed evolution for the calibration period (2002-2004) and for the
validation period (2004-2006) are presented in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14, respectively. The

Twin Experiment: A twin experiment (generated synthetic measurement data) is considered to
verify the ability of the framework in ranking the competing morphological models (sediment
transport variants in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe). For this purpose, we postulate certain calibration
parameters and a "true" sediment equation and run the simulation. Subsequently, we accept the
simulation result as the measurement to be used in the Bayesian selection framework. The goal
is to infer if the framework can identify the best sediment formula and guide the user to the

55
presumed calibration parameters.
Bed Evolution Measurements: Since in the twin test, there is no restriction of data avail-
ability concerning the calibration and the validation processes, we divide the total simulation
period into two intervals; namely, the calibration period and the validation period. The hydro-
morphodynamic model of the lower Rhine with the variant of Wu equation was simulated for
the duration of about 34 days. The intermediate bed morphological evolution (17 days), shown
in Figure 2.15, is used as the measurements of the calibration process and the ﬁnal output (after
34 days) is implemented in the validation scheme.
Similar to the real measurements, each observation point in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16 is
located in the center of an area which dimensions correspond to a length of 100 meters and
the width of the fairway stretch. The measurement value is the averaged bed morphological
evolution over the analogous area.

2.5 Summary
This chapter introduced the description of the hydro-morphodynamic model (Telemac). All
the equations and parameters necessary to compute the bed evolution have been mentioned in
Section 2.1. Firstly, the shallow water equations derive the hydrodynamic conditions, and then
the morphodynamic module calculate the sediment transport rate to be used for its ﬁnal output,
which is the bed evolution, calculated by Exner equation (Equation 2.4). Section 2.2 provided
a detailed analysis of the selected sediment transport formulae in this study. Additionally, bed
slope effect and secondary current effect modify the bed evolution. This procedure is repeated at
every time step, and the coupling between the hydrodynamic (Telemac2d) and morphodynamic
(Sisyphe) modules is also taken into account.
Two case tests have been described in this chapter. A test case model, based on an experiment
done by Yen and Lee (1995) and a real river case study of the river Rhine. The channel bed
model of Yen and Lee (1995) has been inspired by a laboratory experiment in a 180◦channel
bend to investigate bed topography and crosswise sediment sorting in a channel bend under
unsteady ﬂow conditions. The results of the physical experiment are the measurements of bed
topographic evolution. The second case study is performed on a river model from the central
reach of the Lower Rhine at Düsseldorf/Neuss (Rhine-km 739.0 to Rhine-km 749.0). The
numerical model of the 10 km Rhine section has an unstructured, triangulated grid with 41277
nodes and 81684 elements and ﬁve different roughness zones.

3 Bayesian Model Selection
Framework
The greatest challenge in the hydro-morphodynamic modeling is the selection of reliable and
feasible models that can adequately describe real behaviors of surface ﬂows and simultaneously
account for uncertainty. To address this issue, the present thesis proposes a framework that pro-
vides objective guidance in model selection to assist even less experienced users in selection of
the most suitable hydro-morphodynamic model by reducing the professional expertise required
for manual calibration.
The current chapter presents the methods implemented in the proposed Bayesian Model Se-
lection (BMS) framework. Bayesian model selection uses concepts of probability theory and
numerical integration to obtain a model ranking. First, a stochastic model reduction techniques
is discussed in Section 3.1. Moreover, the improvement method of this response surface is ad-
dressed in Section 3.2. Subsequently, Section 3.3 introduces the concept of Bayesian model
selection based on the posterior distribution of sensitive parameters. This chapter ﬁnishes with
a description of the properties of the BMS toolkit in Section 3.5, in which the ﬁxed terms in
different components of the framework are deﬁned.
3.1 Surrogate Model Construction
Since required simulation results for such a framework is computationally expensive, a model of
the outcome is considered instead. The model reduction is established using so-called surrogate
models (response surface). This model shows the dependence of original model’s output on
the design variables via projections on the orthonormal polynomial basis. In other words, the
surrogate model is a black box that simply reproduce the model outputs in a limited context and
does not require to be acquainted with the internal properties of the original model. Hence, the
response surface of a simple case may not represent the model with different conditions. This
indicates that a trade-off between a wide context of applicability and large computational time
is needed.

58
Bayesian Model Selection Framework
Consideration of alternative system representation signiﬁcantly enhances the sureness of the
modeler and reduces the potential bias in modeling. Even though building response surface is
conceptually straightforward, it is known to be computationally demanding, because the statis-
tical accuracy of their predictions relies on the number of considered realizations. Therefore,
an alternative methodology, discussed in Section 3.1.1, is implemented, which requires only a
few model evaluations to create a response surface.
3.1.1 Data-Driven Polynomial Chaos Expansions
The alternative approach for construction of a response surface is Polynomial Chaos Expansion
(PCE). In general, all PCE techniques are efﬁcient approximations and advanced approaches
to statistical regression to exhibit the dependence of a model to alteration of variables via a re-
sponse surface that is deﬁned using an orthonormal polynomial basis in the parameter space (Li
and Zhang, 2007). In other words, a high-dimensional polynomial approximately represents the
reliance of model output on all related input parameters. The PCE offers an accurate high-order
method of counting for nonlinear effects in stochastic analysis. One of the excellent charac-
teristics of PCE is the high-order approximation of error propagation (Oladyshkin and Nowak,
2012a) along with its computational speed compared to Monte-Carlo method (Oladyshkin et al.,
2011a).
The PCE methods postulate a correct knowledge of the probability density functions of all input
parameters and they are optimal only if they are applied to a ﬁnite number of certain parametric
probability distributions. However, the information regarding the statistical distribution of input
parameters is, unfortunately, scarce, especially in environmental engineering and sciences (Red-
Horse and Benjamin, 2004). Moreover, another source, which introduces new subjectivity into
the analysis and may result in bias, is to build probability density functions of any particular
shape from samples of limited size or scattered information. In a related application study
(Oladyshkin et al., 2011b), the authors illustrate that new subjectivity in data interpretation
could strictly affect uncertainty quantiﬁcation and risk assessment, and thus lead to failure.
Hence, there was a demand for further adaptation of the chaos expansion technique to a larger
assortment of distributions.
Given the mentioned challenges, Oladyshkin and Nowak (2012b) present the generalization of
PCE to arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) expansion that accommodates a broad spectrum of
arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures. The distributions not only can be
either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous, but they can also be delineated either an-
alytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histograms

59
or as raw data sets. The aPC adjusts to arbitrary probability distribution shapes of input parame-
ters and can even work with unidentiﬁed distribution forms when only a few statistical moments
can be derived from limited data or expert judgment (Oladyshkin et al., 2011b; Oladyshkin and
Nowak, 2012a).
Multi-dimensional aPC: Let us consider a stochastic process in the probability space (Ω,A,Γ)
with space of events Ω, σ-algebra A, and probability measure Γ. The stochastic model is
Y = f(ω) with multi-dimensional model input ω, i.e ω = {ξ1,ξ2,...,ξN} ∈Ωand model output
Y. Here, N is equal to the total number of input (uncertain) parameters. The model output Y
can be expressed via a multivariate polynomial expansion (response surface) as follows:
Y(X,ω) ≈˜Y(X,ω) =
P
∑
i=1
ci(X)φi(ω) .
(3.1)
Here, the coefﬁcients ci denote the reliance of the model output Y at the measurement location
(X) on the input parameters ξ1,ξ2,...,ξN. The value P in Equation 3.1 depends on the total
number of input parameters N and on the order of the expansion d according to the combinatory
formula P = (N +d)!/(N!d!). Moreover, the function φi illustrates the multi-variate orthogonal
polynomial basis for ξ1,ξ2,...,ξN. Here, a surrogate model of ﬁrst order is considered.
Assuming the independence of the input parameters, the multi-dimensional basis can be created
as a simple product of the corresponding univariate polynomials:
φi(ω) ≈
N
∏
j=1
P
(αi
j)
j
(ω) ,
N
∑
j=1
αi
j ≤M, i = 1,...,N ,
(3.2)
where αi
j is a multivariate index that contains the combinatory information how to count all
possible products of individual univariate basis functions. In fact, the index α can be seen as
P×N matrix, which contains the corresponding degree (e.g. 0, 1, 2, etc.) for parameter number
j in expansion term k.
The set of polynomials {P(0)
j
,...,P(d)
j
} shapes an orthogonal basis of degree d in the space of
parameter ωj. Generally, the polynomial P(k)
j (ω j) of degree k in an individual parameter ωj can
be expressed as a simple linear combination of the different powers i of ωj:
P(k)
j (ωj) =
P
∑
i=1
P(k)
i,j ωi
j,
k = 0,...d, j = 0,...N ,
(3.3)
where P(k)
i,j is the coefﬁcient for the power i = 0,...,k within the polynomial P(k)
j (ωj).

60
Bayesian Model Selection Framework
According to Oladyshkin et al. (2013), an orthogonal polynomial basis can be deﬁned for any
arbitrary polynomial measures, as ωj has ﬁnite statistical moments, such as mean, variance,
skewness, etc. up to order 2d −1.
The following relation deﬁnes the P(k)

(3.4)
where µ(k,j) denotes the ith non-central (raw) statistical moments of the random variable ωj. It
is apparent from Equation 3.4 that statistical moments are the sole source of information needed
about the input distributions and propagated in all polynomial expansion-based stochastic ap-
proaches (Oladyshkin and Nowak, 2012a). In the current study, an orthonormal basis is taken
into account.
3.1.2 Collocation Method
There are many different methods to compute the unknown coefﬁcients ci(X) of the expansion
in Equation 3.1. The objective of the available methods is to derive ci(X) from the weighted
residual minimization or projection point of view. In this study, the non-intrusive Probabilistic
Collocation Method (PCM) is applied because it does not enforce any rearrangement, or sim-
pliﬁcation on the initial ﬂow model, i.e. no change in the system of the governing equations.
In other words, this approach can consider any simulation model as a black-box, that means
the commercial software can be used without any modiﬁcations required. The fundamental
conception of this method was presented by Villadsen and Michelsen (1978).
Collocation Approach and Formulation: The main idea of the collocation method is to match
the unknown coefﬁcients ci to model outputs Yi evaluated with different parameters sets ω j.
A given N-dimensional set of parameters ωj is named as a collocation point in the multidi-
mensional parameter space. The number of collocation points ωj is equal to the number P of
unknown coefﬁcients ci in the formulated chaos expansion in Equation 3.1. It requires P (from
combinatory formula) model evaluations in total, which leads to the following:
MΦ(ω)Vc(X) = VY(X) ,
(3.5)
where Vc is the P×1 vector of unknown coefﬁcients ci, VY is the P×1 vector holding the model
output Yi(ωi) for each collocation point ωi, and the P × P matrix MΦ contains the P Hermite

3.1 Surrogate Model Construction
61
polynomials Hj(ωi) evaluated at the P collocation points. It is worth mentioning that the matrix
MΦ(ω) is space- and time-independent and can be produced once for the given expansion degree
and parameter number, whereas the Vc(X) vectors and VY(X) are space- and time-dependent.
Selection of Collocation Points: The efﬁciency of PCM strongly (the solution Vc(X) in Equa-
tion 3.5) rests on the selection of collocation points (Li and Zhang, 2007).
Villadsen and
Michelsen (1978) assert in their book that the best selection of collocation points agrees with
the roots of the polynomial of one degree higher than the order considered in the chaos expan-
sion. Thus, the resulting polynomial surface is precise at the collocation points and applies a
polynomial interpolation or extrapolation on interior and exterior of the domain with colloca-
tion points, respectively. Moreover, the number of available points in the multi-dimensional
case, is larger than the required number of collocation points. Therefore, a principal strategy for
the selection of collocation points must be considered from the available strategies, which are
as follows: (I) totally random and (II) selection based on the distribution of the input parame-
ters. In this study, the second option is implemented. The focus is on the best estimation of the
mean stochastic characteristics and hence, the selection of the collocation points from the most
plausible section of the input parameters’ distributions.
The scheme used in this study, which is analogous to Gaussian quadrature, entails selecting
the collocation points from the roots of the next higher order orthogonal polynomial for each
uncertain parameter at a given order of polynomials. These points are the ones from which
we derive the approximation of the real model via a response surface (see e.g. Villadsen and
Michelsen (1978); Webster et al. (1996); Tatang et al. (1997)).
Let us consider the polynomial order is d, then the number of available collocation points
is (d + 1)N, which is continuously greater than the required number of collocation points.
For example, in case of the ﬁrst-order PCM, the P sets of collocation points; denoted as
(ξ1,1,ξ2,1,,ξN,1), (ξ1,2,ξ2,2,,ξN,2), ···, (ξ1,P,ξ2,P,,ξN,P), are essential. They are selected from
all the combinations of the two roots of the second-order Hermite polynomial.
Here we show how to make the selection of the P sets of collocation points. The ﬁrst set
of collocation point always contains the roots with the highest probability for each random
variable. Note that we sort the roots based on closeness to the mean value in the case of uniform
probability. The other sets of collocation points are picked by maintaining as many of the
variables with high probability as possible (Li and Zhang, 2007). The P sets of collocation
points for a given type of polynomial chaos of known N and d are independent of physical
problems at hand. As for integration points in Gaussian quadrature, the selection of collocation
points only must be done once and can, henceforth, be arranged in advance.
Since the polynomial chaos expansion is a black box model, Webster et al. (1996) suggest the

62
Bayesian Model Selection Framework
consideration of a linear approximation as a ﬁrst guess for the response surface. Therefore, a
linear response surface is considered to approximate the model throughout this study.
Post-processing computations: When the coefﬁcients have been estimated, the polynomials
in Equation 3.1 can represent the initial model. This procedure implies that the computational
cost of evaluating different statistical quantities is signiﬁcantly reduced.
Each model output Y(X) has its own response surface, and consequently its coefﬁcients in space
and the mean value of the output Y(X) can be represented via coefﬁcient c1(X). The following
expression calculates the variance.
σ2
Y(X) =
P
∑
i=2

i (X) .
(3.6)
Monte Carlo simulation can be directly performed on the constructed polynomial to evaluate
more complex statistical quantities. By doing so, the probability density function and cumula-
tive distribution function of the model output can be readily obtained.
3.2 Bayesian Updating of Surrogate Model
The aPC method presented in Section 3.1 builds a response surface; also known as surrogate
model ˜Y(ω), that approximates the original simulation model Y(ω). In fact, this reduced model
is exceptionally faster than the original model, because the reduced model is solely a polyno-
mial and has functional properties owing to the orthogonal basis. Once a surrogate model has
been created, inverse modeling (also known as history matching) to the available observations
becomes an exceptionally signiﬁcant subject to enhance the model quality. The reliability of
history matching, however, increases with the number of available observations.
Conventionally, an iterative manual approach of trial and error is implemented to adjust the
simulation models to reproduce past measurements in the ﬁeld of river engineering. However,
such a manual process requires a remarkably sound expertise of the investigation’s processes.
Moreover, the non-trivial and non-linear relations of the matched parameters within the model
can signiﬁcantly complicate the history matching process (Oliver et al., 2001).
Another important issue regarding history matching methods is that they can yield non-unique
solutions (Oliver et al., 2008), i.e. several simulated models and parameter sets can ﬁt the
observation data similarly well. Nevertheless, stochastic approaches can deal with such type
of uncertainty arising during the matching process without the necessity to limit the parameter
space artiﬁcially. In fact, their outputs are a probability distribution of possible parameters

sets instead of a single best parameter set. However, stochastic approaches are more expensive
than classical optimization-based calibration methods, as they need to examine the full range of
possible model results with numerous model runs.
Methods based on response surfaces or other surrogate models have recently been integrated
with more precise forms of Bayesian updating that apply Bayesian theory (see e.g. Smith and
Geﬂand (1992)) in practice for model updating and forecasting. In the current section, a fully
accurate Bayesian updating is implemented to match the response surface ˜Y(ω) to available
measurements in a data vector yo of past or real-time observations of system behavior. This
approach not only provides the essential ﬂexibility to deal with arbitrary distributions of model
parameters, including high-order statistical moments, but it can also handle the conditional
parameter distributions that occur after Bayesian updating. In addition, Bootstrap ﬁltering is
the most direct yet straightforward numerical implementation of Bayes theorem, which can
consider arbitrary non-linear model equations and arbitrary distribution forms as opposed to
(Ensemble) Kalman Filters (Evensen, 2009). Henceforth, Bootstrap ﬁltering is a suitable match
for combination with the aPC technique.
3.2.1 Bayesian Updating
In this Section, Bayesian updating via weighted bootstrap (see e.g. Smith and Geﬂand (1992))
is applied to ﬁt the surrogate model ˜Y(ω) to available measurements in a data vector yo past
observations of system behavior. According to Bayes and Price (1763), Bayes’ theorem is
deﬁned as follows:
f(ω|yo) = f(yo|ω)f(ω)
f(yo)
,
(3.7)
where f(ω) denotes the joint prior PDF for the vector of model parameters ω, f(yo) is the prior
probability of yo, used as normalization constant, f(yo|ω) is the conditional PDF of y for given
ω, i.e., the likelihood of the parameters, and f(ω|yo) is the conditional PDF of ω for given yo,
which is intended to be approximated rapidly and precisely. Bay’s theorem (Equation 3.7) can
be rewritten the following expression:
p(Θk|Mk,yo) = p(yo|Mk,Θk)p(Θk|Mk)
p(yo|Mk)
,
(3.8)
where p(yo|Mk) represents a model-speciﬁc normalizing constant for the posterior of the pa-
rameters (Θ), p(Θk|Mk,yo).
To set up the Monte Carlo framework for calibration and model ranking, we have produced a
set of predictions based on NMC random realizations of parameters for each competing model.
These realizations were drawn from uniform priors p(θk|Mk) of uncertain parameters.

64
Bayesian Model Selection Framework
On the common assumption that the measurement errors are independent and have Gaussian
distribution, the likelihood function p(yo|Mk,Θk) is deﬁned as following:
p(yo|Mk,Θk) = 2π−Ns/2|R′|
1
2 exp

−1
2
 yo −˜Y(Θk)
TR−1  yo −˜Y(Θk)

,
(3.9)
where R is the diagonal (co)variance matrix of size Ns × Ns (Ns refers to the length of the
measurement dataset) with standard deviation of measurement error (ε). Though other arbitrary
error distributions could be considered, the assumption on the measurement error distribution
remains throughout the study.
Likelihood weights are assigned to each realization of Θk using Equation 3.9. To update the
surrogate model ˜Y(Θk) (or ˜Y(ω)) through an iterative procedure, the realization Θk with the
highest probability (likelihood) is chosen and the original (hydro-morphodynamic model in
Telemac-2d-Sisyphe) is executed. The result of this run, then, is used as new information for
reconstructing the response surfaces at the measurement locations.
When the prior information is far from the reality, it is likely that the surrogate model is highly
imprecise and produces wrong outcomes. This imprecision stems from the fundamental princi-
ple of all chaos expansion methods that the approximation error is the lowest where the high-
est (prior) probability density occurs, that means signiﬁcant errors may befall in less probable
regions. Avoiding this, an advanced iterative approach for aPC-based Bayesian updating is
considered that allows performing updating task even where the prior assumptions on model
parameters are offset from the reality. In this method, the response surface is reiterated to be-
come more precise in the relevant areas of high posterior probability.
3.2.2 Bootstrap Filtering
Likelihood weights, which represents the probability of the parameter set being able to repro-
duce the measurements, have assigned to the samples from the prior distribution of parameters
(realizations) using Equation 3.9. In bootstrap ﬁltering (also known as rejection sampling), the
purpose is to ﬁlter poorly performed realizations. It accommodates the quantiﬁcation of the
post-calibration parameter and the predictive uncertainty and is more accurate than ensemble
Kalman ﬁltering or linearized methods, as stated in Oladyshkin et al. (2013). To do so, a number
Np of realizations of parameter vectors Θk,i are drawn from the prior PDF p(Θk|Mk):
Θ(k,i) ∼p(Θk|Mk),
i = (1,Np) ,
(3.10)

3.3 Bayesian Model Selection
65
where Np is an adequately large number. Additionally, assigning relative importance weights
wi to each realization Θ(k,i) by the following expression:
wi =
p(yo|Mk,Θk,i)
max{p(yo|Mk,Θk,i)} ,
(3.11)
where max{p(yo|Mk,Θk,i)} is the biggest individual values p(yo|Mk,Θk,i) available over all
realizations i = (1,Np).
Then, realization Θk,i is acknowledged as a valid ensemble member of the posterior distribution,
if wi ≥ui is satisﬁed for a random number ui drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval
of (0,1).
Weight disproportion, which leads to weight collapse, is a typical issue encountered in the
ﬁltering schemes; however, including a resampling step can mitigate this problem. This step
can be considered before the second ﬁltration (ﬁltration of the prior distribution for validation),
where it is likely that no realization remains after the ﬁrst ﬁltration. Note that the posterior
distributions of uncertain parameters are considered as prior knowledge of parameters for the
validation process.
Sample Enlargement: In the bootstrap ﬁltering step, the particles with negligible weights are
removed from the prior distributions of uncertain parameters. Then, the objective of this step
is to enlarge the parameter set in the proximity of the remaining particles that possess higher
likelihood weights.
In this case, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to estimate probability density function
of a random variable is used as the basis for drawing new samples of random numbers. In this
scheme, a small amount of zero-centered random noise is added onto each observation.
3.3 Bayesian Model Selection
In this section, a statistical framework, called Bayesian selection that can provide objective
guidance in model selection is explained. This framework ranks the plausibility of competing
models according to Bayes’ theorem. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) (see Draper (1995);
Hoeting et al. (1999)) is a formal statistical approach with remarkable features. These features
are included but not limited to allowing the user to compare alternative conceptual models, to
test their adequacy, combine their forecasts into a more robust output estimation, and quan-
tify the contribution of conceptual uncertainty to the general prediction uncertainty (Schöniger
et al., 2014). An updated posterior model parameters’ probabilities from the corresponding

66
Bayesian Model Selection Framework
prior beliefs are used as model weights for ranking of the competing models. These posterior
probabilities are based on the ability of each model in reproducing the measurement data.
According to Schöniger et al. (2014), BMA implicitly follows the principle of parsimony or
Occam’s razor, in which the posterior model weights indicate an optimal trade-off between
model goodness of ﬁt and complexity. Hence, it plays a signiﬁcant role in the quantiﬁcation
of model prediction uncertainty, which reinforces the foundation for managerial purposes and
risk assessment. BMA ranks competing models without averaging them. Therefore, Bayesian
selection will be used in the following section to avoid any confusion.
3.3.1 Bayesian Selection
In this section, the formulation of the Bayesian selection is presented according to Hoeting
et al. (1999). Let us consider Nm credible, competing models Mk. The posterior predictive
distribution of a desired realization Θk given the vector of observed data y0 can be expressed as:
p(Θk|y0) =
Nm
∑
k=1
p(Θk|yo,Mk)P(Mk|yo) ,
(3.12)
with p(Θk|yo,Mk) representing a conditional probability distribution and P(Mk|yo) being dis-
crete posterior model weights.
In Bayes’ theorem, the model weights can be calculated by:
P(Mk|yo) =
p(yo|Mk)P(Mk)
∑Nm
i=1 p(yo|Mi)P(Mi)
,
(3.13)
where P(Mk) is subjective credibility of model Mk accounting for its plausibility in the set of
models before any observed data have been considered. In Hoeting et al. (1999), the authors
state that a "reasonable and neutral choice" for the choice of P(Mk) could be equally likely priors
P(Mk) = 1/Nm, where little prior knowledge about the advantages of the different models under
investigation exists. In this study, subjective credibility of each model follows the assumption
of equally likely priors of P(Mk) = 1/Nm. The denominator in Equation 3.13 normalizes all
model weights by a normalizing constant of the posterior distribution of the models.
In Equation 3.13, p(yo|Mk) quantiﬁes the BME term, also referred to as marginal likelihood or
prior predictive of the observed data based on the prior distribution of the parameters (Kass and
Raftery, 1995):
p(yo|Mk) =
ˆ
Ωk
p(yo|Mk,Θk)p(Θ|Mk)dΘk ,
(3.14)
where Θk denotes the vector of parameters of model Mk with a dimension equal to the number
of parameters N(p,k), Ωk is the corresponding parameter space, p(yo|Mk,Θk) is the likelihood of

3.3 Bayesian Model Selection
67
a realization of the model Mk to have produced the observed data set yo (calculated by Equa-
tion Equation 3.9) and p(Θ|Mk) represents their prior distribution of each model. To rank
the competing models, if p(yo|Mk) is computed under the assumption of equal model priors
(P(Mk) = 1/Nm), the model that maximizes marginal likelihood is the one with the highest
probability of being the "true" given observed data.
The BME term can either be assessed by integration over the full parameter space Ωk (Equation
3.14, mentioned in Kass and Raftery (1995) as Bayesian integral, or by the posterior probability
distribution of the parameters p(Θk|Mk,yo) via rewriting Bayes’ theorem (Equation 3.8) with
respect to the parameter distribution instead of model distribution.
Generally, three approaches exist for solving Equation 3.14; namely Analytical Evaluation,
Mathematical Evaluation and Numerical Evaluation. The ﬁrst method can be considered under
strongly limiting assumptions, whereas the other two approaches are more preferable. A full
description of all three methods can be found in Schöniger et al. (2014). They conducted a
thorough comparison of nine ways to assess Bayesian model evidence. In the present study, the
focus is on the numerical evaluation approach in the computation of the BME.
Numerical Evaluation: Evans and Swartz (1995) offers a rigorous review of numerical meth-
ods to assess the Bayesian integral (Equation 3.14). They stated that traditional integration
schemes; e.g. adaptive Gaussian quadrature, are the algorithms of choice for low-dimensional
applications. Another review on strengths and limitations of numerical methods that can also
be applied to highly complex models is given by Schöniger et al. (2014).
In this thesis, Simple Monte Carlo integration (Hammersley, 1960) is considered. According to
Schöniger et al. (2014), this method is the most suitable approach since it is bias-free and dis-
pense with any assumptions on the shape of the parameter distribution. This approach evaluates
the integrand at randomly chosen points in parameter space
 Θ(k,i)

, which are randomly drawn
from their prior distribution p(Θk|Mk). The Bayesian integral (or expected value over param-
eter space) in Equation 3.14 is then determined as the mean value of the evaluated likelihoods
calculated by Equation 3.9 (also referred to as arithmetic mean approach):
p(yo|Mk) = 1
NP
NP
∑
i=1
p(yo|Mk,Θk,i) ,
(3.15)
with NP representing the number of Monte Carlo (MC) realizations and p(Mk,Θk,i|yo) denoting
the conditional PDF of y for given realization Θ(k,i) for model Mk.
Schöniger et al. (2014) point out: "For large ensemble sizes Np and a friendly overlap of the
parameter prior and the likelihood function, this method will provide very accurate results. For
high dimensional parameter spaces, however, a sufﬁcient (converging) ensemble might come at
a high or even prohibitive computational cost."

Bayesian Model Selection Framework
3.4 Properties of BMS Framework
The procedure mentioned in the previous sections is repeated for all the competing models to
produce a ranking using the BME values. In the subsequent section, the terms and the inputs
that will be utilized in the toolkit are addressed.
Measurement Error: Measurement errors can be subdivided into two components, namely
random error, and systematic error. Random errors are errors in measurement that results in
inconsistency of the measurable values when various measures of an unchanging attribute or
quantity are taken. However, Systematic error is also known as a nonzero mean error, because
its effect is not diminished when observations are averaged. These errors are not determined
accidentally but are introduced by an inherent observation inaccuracy in the system. The mea-
surement error in Equation 3.9 needs to be deﬁned by the user. This value can be described as a
desired criterion for calculation of likelihood weights based on the proximity of their simulated
value to the measurements using the response surface.
Uncertain Parameters: As discussed in Section 1.5, many morphodynamic models include
empirical formulations, i.e. their formulations consist of experimentally determined variables
and coefﬁcients based on limited available datasets. These datasets were mostly from controlled
experiments or real data from rivers but under certain conditions, which might not include the
actual situations in nature. Therefore, the presented framework incorporates uncertain parame-
ters, which the user categorizes as uncertain.
Prior Knowledge of Uncertain Parameters: In optimization schemes, it is likely that wrong
prior knowledge about the selected sensitive parameters hinders the optimization procedure,
and navigate us to less probable scenarios. As mentioned before, the framework is attuned to
any assumption on the bounds and distribution of chosen parameters.
Sample Size: This term refers to the number of the prior parameter sets or realizations that sig-
niﬁcantly contribute to the posterior distribution. These realizations receive likelihood weights
after the construction of the surrogate models.
Iteration: The sole objective of the iteration on the improvement of response surface (surro-
gate model) is to adjust these models to the observed bed evolutions. In each iteration, new
information acquired from the previous response surface is included in the adjustment process.
Stochastic Calibration: The calibration is conducted by simulating the hydro-morphodynamic
models in the Telemac-2d-Sisyphe, using the best parameter set that possesses the largest like-
lihood.

3.5 Summary
69
Stochastic Validation: The validation process also follows the same routine of stochastic cali-
bration. Note that the stochastic approach in calibration and validation is not similar to that of
river engineering, i.e. the surrogate model remains the same as constructed in calibration stage,
but the calibrated parameter set may vary in the validation step.
Table 3.1 presents the user deﬁned inputs required for the BMS Toolkit. All the inputs of each
case study will be presented in their associated sections in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.

3.5 Summary
This chapter presented the methods implemented in the proposed Bayesian framework for
model selection. Figure 3.1 shows a summary of the research methodology.
The framework is composed of three main steps. In step 1, a mathematically optimal response
surface approximates each hydro-morphodynamic model’s outputs through the aPC technique.
The response surfaces are constructed at all observation points. Afterward, likelihood weights is
assigned to each parameter set based on the closeness of the response surfaces to the observation
points.
Step 2 entails matching the reduced model from the previous step to the observation data using
iterations. Here, the aim is to improve the response surfaces by including the parameter set with
the highest importance index to the sets of collocation points to rebuild the response surfaces
and reassign the likelihoods to get the posterior distributions of realizations.Further, this step
contains bootstrap ﬁltering. With this method, realizations with lower likelihoods comparing to
the other sets are discarded. The probability density distribution of the ﬁltered posterior param-
eter sets can be used for any inferences of the most probable region of calibration parameters
for further task of optimization.

Step 3 consists of calculation of the Bayesian Model Evidence (BME). From the resulting pos-
teriors in step 2 that provides a comprehensible post data summary of the residual uncertainty,
BME value of each model is calculated.
The procedure mentioned above is repeated for all the competing models to produce the ranking.
With this combination, a statistical method for model selection is obtained that is accurate, yet
has an acceptable computational speed that is sufﬁcient to be implemented in the real-time
application.

4 Bayesian Model Selection for
Channel Bend Experiment
The abundance of the existing morphodynamic models hinders the model selection for less
experienced engineers. To eliminate the problem in selection of hydro-morphodynamic models,
the proposed Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) framework presented in this study intends to
serve as guidance in the model selection of the hydro-morphodynamic models. This proposed
approach can also suggest the most likely region of uncertain parameters for the task of history
matching.
Assessing the performance of the BMS framework, it was ﬁrst implemented in the hydro-
morphodynamic numerical model for the channel bend from Yen and Lee (1995). The fol-
lowing chapter begins with the setup and implementation of Channel Bend test case in the
framework (Section 4.1). Subsequently, the results of the BMS in the model selection of the
hydro-morphodynamic model of the Yen and Lee’s experiment are demonstrated in Section 4.2.
Lastly, Section 4.3 includes the uncertainty analysis of the BMS for the same test case.
4.1 Setup and Implementation
The geometry, initial conditions and all relevant information of the channel bend model have
been explained in detail in Section 2.3. All the considered morphodynamic models, uncertain
parameters and their selected ranges, stochastic calibration and validation scenarios, and other
BMS toolkit’s inputs are subsequently summarized.
Examined Hydro-Morphodynamic Models: In Sisyphe module, the volume of the sediment
transport (bed-load) per unit width (Qb) in Exner Equation (Equation 2.4) is computed via dif-
ferent bed load transport formulae, i.e. different hydro-morphodynamic models when coupled
with Telemac-2D.
The selected formulae in the current test case is summarized in Table 4.1. More details about

discussed in Section 2.2.

Chosen Uncertain Parameters and their Bounds: Under the assumption of insufﬁcient
knowledge on the distribution of the selected uncertain parameters, the uniform distributions
were preferred for all parameters. Moreover, the bounds were introduced to coincide with
mostly physically meaningful parameter limits. The selected hydro-morphological parameters
and the corresponding ranges are shown in Table 4.2.

Measurement Error, Sample Size and number of Iterations: The measurement error, in
this case, was selected as 0.08. The reference Bayesian Model Evidence (BME) value for
each model was determined by MC integration (Equation 3.13) over ensembles of 150,000
realizations per model. Moreover, the iteration via Bayesian updating was performed for ten
times.

4.2 Bayesian Model Ranking
73
Stochastic Calibration and Validation Scenarios: The conventional approach to calibration
and validation is to calibrate a model for a time period and validate it for another period. For
the simplicity, however, we calibrated the numerical model of the Bend Channel for the mea-
surement locations at 90 degrees, and then validation was performed for the observation points
located at 180 degrees. Within this approach, we created the response surface using the mea-
surements at the calibration locations and used them for the validation scenario without any
alterations.
4.2 Bayesian Model Ranking
The results of the BMS for the numerical model of Channel Bend for all ﬁve selected hydro-
morphodynamic models are provided in the following section. The Bayesian model ranking is
presented at the end of this section under the title of BME Comparison. Moreover, some ﬁgures
and diagrams of competing models are incorporated into Appendix I.
Meyer-Peter-Müller Model: The plots in Figure 4.1 illustrate the simulation output of the
hydro-morphodynamic model including the Meyer-Peter-Müller equation for the bed-load
transport rate at the 90 degrees and 180 degrees of the channel bend, respectively against the
output of the surrogate model considering the parameter set with the highest likelihood in the
calibration stage. The blue line represents the response surface and the simulated bed evolution
is shown with the red curve. The horizontal axis shows the distance from the inner side of the
ﬂume, and the vertical axis presents the bed evolution after 300 minutes.

surface considering the posterior parameter sets. The lower bounds of this zone are shown by
the mean value of response surface outputs of the posterior parameter set minus two times of
their standard deviation, and the upper bounds mean plus two times the standard deviation. As
it is noticeable from Figure 4.1a and Figure 4.1b, the improved response surface after iterations
acceptably represented the original numerical model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe.
The likelihood of the prior realizations before and after improvement of the response surface
are presented in Appendix I. Figure 4.2 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the
posterior distribution of uncertain parameters along with their statistical characteristics. Ker-
nel Density Estimation (KDE) approach was employed to approximate the probability density
function of a variable. KDE is a fundamental data smoothing problem that allows us to make
inferences about the population, based on a ﬁnite data sample and are closely linked to his-
tograms.

75
The likelihood weights of the prior realization for the validation stage were assigned based on
the validation measurements (measurement locations at 180 degrees). Figure 4.3 demonstrates
the simulation output and the performance range of the response surface for the parameter set
with the highest likelihood.
(a) At 90 degrees
(b) At 180 degrees
Figure 4.3: Simulation output vs. response surface (validation-Meyer-Peter-Müller model)
In Figure 4.3, the visible misﬁt of the simulation production and the reduced model (response
surface) at location 180 degree can be attributed to the fact that the response surface, constructed
in calibration stage, has not been adapted to the validation positions. In other words, no iteration
on the improvement of the surrogate model was taken into account in the validation step.
The validation’s prior likelihood weights (shown in Appendix I) was improved signiﬁcantly,
and it suggests that the posterior realizations after the validation show better performance for
the validation locations within their pre-deﬁned ranges. Figure 4.4 shows the probability density
function (PDF) of the posterior distribution of uncertain parameters after validation step.

Einstein-Brown Model: The results of the hydro-morphodynamic model comprising of the
bed-load transport rate of Einstein-Brown (1950) are presented in the following section. The
plots in Figure 4.5 show the model’s simulation output against the response surface in calibra-
tion step (using measurements at the location of 90 degrees).

Figure 4.5: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Einstein-Brown model)
Similar to the previous model, the likelihood of the prior realizations before and after improve-
ment of the response surface are presented in Appendix I. For the Einstein-Brown model, many
realizations (parameter sets) received lower likelihood weights in comparison with the Meyer-
Peter-Müller model.
Figure 4.6 displays the probability density function (PDF) of the posterior distributions of un-
certain parameters with their corresponding statistical characteristics. Due to the poor likeli-
hood weight, fewer realizations remained after the bootstrap-ﬁltering step, and this is reﬂected
in the posterior PDF of parameters for the Einstein-Brown model in comparison with that of
Meyer-Peter- Müller model (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.7 demonstrates the simulation output and the performance range of the response sur-
face for the parameter set with the highest likelihood in the validation step (using observations
at 180 degrees of the channel bend).

Figure 4.8 exhibits the probability density function (PDF) of the posterior distribution of uncer-
tain parameters after validation step. Many distributions formed more concentrated shape that
are informative for the further task of the optimization.

Modiﬁed Engleund-Hansen Model:The plots in Figure 4.9 illustrate the model’s simulation
output against the response surface in calibration step (using measurements at the location of 90
degrees). The conﬁdence interval of the response surface (the gray area) was considerably nar-
row due to few remaining parameter sets passed the bootstrap-ﬁltering stage in the calibration
stage. This fact also mirrored in the posterior probability density function in Figure 4.10.

The posterior information on best parameter sets in the calibration stage was considered as
the prior knowledge on the distribution of the parameters for the validation step. Additionally,
the enlargement of the prior was conducted. Figure 4.11 shows the simulation output and the
performance range of the response surface for the parameter set with the highest likelihood in
the validation step.

Similar to Figure 4.9, the validation step also generated thin performance domain of the re-
sponse surface. In contrast, more realizations remained after the bootstrap-ﬁltering and the
probability distribution of the parameters are more concentrated.
Van Rijn Model: The plots in Figure 4.13 illustrate the model’s simulation output against the
response surface in the calibration step for the Van Rijn model. Although the simulated bed evo-
lution fell within the performance range of the response surface (the gray area), the constructed
response surface after ten times improvement, unlike other models, failed to adequately repre-
sent the original model.

The likelihood weights after the improvement of the response surface, shown in Appendix I,
show a signiﬁcant reduction. The posterior probability distributions of the parameters, the sim-
ulation bed evolution versus the response surface, and the posterior probability distributions of
the parameters in the validation step follow.

From the diagrams above, it is evident that the surrogate model was not fruitful to be a replace-
ment for the original model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe.
Wu Model: The last tested hydro-morphodynamic model included the bed-load transport rate
equation suggested by Wu et al. (2000). This variant was manually introduced to morphody-
namic module Sisyphe. The response surface built in the Bayesian framework could capture the
behavior of the original model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe as shown in Figure 4.17.
(a) At 90 degrees
(b) At 180 degrees
Figure 4.17: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Wu model)
The probability distribution of parameters are presented in Figure 4.17. The distribution shapes
suggest fairly wide ranges, which are less informative for any inferences for any further task of
optimization.
The posterior realizations resulting from the calibration was used as the prior information in
the validation stage. Also, the response surface established in the calibration was implemented
in the validation phase without any modiﬁcations. The realization with the highest likelihood,
was inserted in the original numerical model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe and the surrogate model.
Figure 4.19 illustrates the resulting bed evolution curves.

The probability distributions, shown in Figure 4.20, demonstrate adequately focused distribu-
tion shapes, which can effectively assist the user in identifying the best calibration parameter
set.

BME Comparison: Bayesian model selection is performed based on Bayesian Model Evidence
(BME), which is a product of Bayesian Model Averaging (see Section 3.3.1). BME term also
referred to as marginal likelihood or prior predictive of the observed data based on the prior
distribution of the parameters (Equation 3.12) is calculated by implementing Simple Monte
Carlo integration method. The development of BME values of the competing models over the
iterations on the improvement of the response surface (surrogate model) is depicted in Figure
4.21.

scale)
According to the graph above, the hydro-morphodynamic model of Meyer-Peter-Müller demon-
strated the best performance among the competing models after the calibration step. However,
model selection must be made based on the BME values after the validation. Table 4.3 summa-
rizes the BME values of the competing models calculated according to Equation 3.10 after the
validation step.

Table 4.3 reveals that the hydro-morphodynamic model containing the modiﬁed Engleund-
Hansen bed-load transport rate equation was the best model after validation step. However,
this model had been the least favorable model in the calibration step. Even though the like-
lihood weights were substantially small after the calibration step, the response surface of the
model was also best representation of the original numerical model at the validation locations.

4.3 Uncertainty Analysis of BMS for Channel Bend
89
On the contrary, the morphodynamic model containing the Van Rijn bed load equation was
placed in the last rank among other competing models in the validation step, though it was
ranked as the second in the calibration phase.
In the calibration stage, only few parameter sets survived for the model of modiﬁed Engelund-
Hansen, indicating that many of the prior parameter sets performed poorly, which explains why
its average likelihood (BME) was the lowest and the model was placed in the last rank. In the
validation step, however, this model scored the best, because little uncertainty remained after
the calibration. None of the other models showed a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt, and along with a
small uncertainty, this model gained the highest rank.
4.3 Uncertainty Analysis of BMS for Channel Bend
Uncertainty analysis, in general, attempts to determine probabilities of individual outcomes
when some aspects of the system are not exactly known. The aim here is to characterize the
reduction of uncertainties of BME calculation in the BMS algorithm quantitatively. Therefore,
the impact of various prior information (different mean values and variances of parameters) on
the outcome of BME was investigated, and the prediction conﬁdence intervals after calibration
step for the competing hydro-morphodynamic models were determined.
The BMS was repeated for the channel bend model for 100 times (i.e. slightly dissimilar prior
distributions) with the measurement error of 0.1, and 30,000 samples. Figure 4.23 presents the
BME value ranges for all model. The thickness of the lines indicate that the standard deviation
was remarkably negligible.

The uncertainty of the BME rates after the stochastic validation step for all morphodynamic
models is provided as a box plot diagram in Figure 4.23. It presents in quartiles as the statistical
data, separating the extreme values. The spacing between the different parts of the box specify
the degree of dispersion (kurtosis) and skewness in the BME rates.

4.4 Summary
91
Similar to the results of BME comparison in Section 4.2, the hydro-morphodynamic model
including Modiﬁed equation of Engleund-Hansen was the least favorable model after the cali-
bration step. However, this model was ranked mostly as the best model after the validation step,
as shown in Figure 4.23. Some important statistical features of the BME values, such as mean,
median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis values are summarized in Table 4.4.

The results of uncertainty analysis of channel bend model indicates that morphodynamic models
of Van Rijn and modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen were ranked as the best and the worst models after
the calibration step, respectively. Similar to the previous case (Section 4.2), the morphodynamic
model with the modiﬁed bed-load transport equation of Engelund-Hansen was performed better
than its rival after the validation.
4.4 Summary
This chapter entailed the results of the implementation of the BMS framework proposed by the
current thesis for the ﬁrst test case. This scenario included the model selection of the numerical
model of Bend Channel inspired by the experiment of Yen and Lee (1995), provided by BAW
in Karlsruhe.
The top morphodynamic model in the ranking was the morphodynamic model containing Mod-
iﬁed Engleund-Hansen bed-load equation. The concentrated posterior parameters’ distributions
navigated us to a more credible area for the uncertain parameters for the task of history match-
ing. Moreover, a section was devoted to the uncertainty analysis of the Bayesian model selection
for channel bend, shedding light on the variation of the Bayesian Model Evidence (BME) rates
under various prior information on the uncertain parameters.

a
particularly
difﬁcult
challenge
for
hydro-
morphodynamic modeling.
Signiﬁcant sedimentation on inner bends and erosion on outer
curves characterize these regions. As a result, the shape of the banks and riverbed is constantly
changing, producing dynamic conditions in curved channels, thus affecting the ﬂow features.
This alteration may disturb particularly the inland navigation, as well as ﬂood events.
In addition to the test case of Channel Bend (Chapter 4), the algorithm was implemented in
model selection for the hydro-morphodynamic numerical model of the 10-km stretch of the
lower Rhine (see Section 4.3). The following chapter starts with the Bayesian Model Selection
(BMS) of the twin experiment of the lower Rhine model in Section 5.1, followed by the BMS
of the real case (Section 5.2). Each section includes the setup and implementation of the BMS
framework for each item, in which all the considered components of the framework are pre-
sented. Then, the results of the implementation of the BMS framework in the test case of the
hydro-morphodynamic model of the river Rhine are provided.
5.1 BMS for Twin Experiment of the Lower Rhine Model
The second hydro-morphodynamic numerical model introduced to the framework was the
model of 10-km of the Lower Rhine River. The algorithm was initially benchmarked with a
synthetic test case (Twin Experiment) to evaluate its ability in the identiﬁcation of the best
model for a numerical hydro-morphodynamic model of a natural river with an artiﬁcial mea-
surement. Section 2.2 provided a detailed introduction to the location and characteristics of the
area, as well as the model geometry, numerical model, initial and boundary conditions, and the
synthetic measurements.

5.1.1 Setup and Implementation
The synthetic bed evolution was the simulation outputs of the hydro-morphodynamic model
including Wu formula as displayed in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16. In this test, the framework
must navigate us to the morphodynamic model of Wu equation. All the considered morpho-
dynamic models, BMS framework’s inputs, as well as calibration and validation scenarios, are
summarized in the following sections.
Examined Hydro-Morphodynamic Models: Table 5.1 lists the selected sediment transport
formulae for the morphodynamic models in the twin test of the numerical model of the lower

Measurement Error, Sample Size, and number of Iterations: Although the synthetic mea-
surement were used here, the measurement error was assumed to be 0.03. This error was de-
signed to account for inherent observation inaccuracy in the system as explained in Section 3.5.

94
Bayesian Model Selection for the Lower Rhine Model
The determination of the reference BME value for each model was performed by MC integra-
tion over ensembles of 20,000 realizations per model. Also, ten iterations of Bayesian updating
were set for each model.
Stochastic Calibration and Validation Scenarios: The common approach to calibration and
validation was implemented here, i.e. the models were validated within another period than
that of the calibration stage. Note that the response surface, which was established using the
measurements in the calibration stage, has been implemented in the validation stage without any
modiﬁcations. However, the calibrated parameter set may vary in the validation step (stochastic
validation).
5.1.2 Bayesian Model Ranking for the Twin Experiment
The outputs of the BMS for the numerical model of the lower Rhine for the competing hydro-
morphodynamic models are presented in the following section. The likelihood weights before
and after the surrogate model’s improvements in the calibration phase and after the validation
phase for all variants can be found in Appendix II.
Meyer-Peter-Müller Model: Figure 5.1 illustrates the simulated output of Telemac-2d-Sisyphe
for the morphodynamic model including the Meyer-Peter-Müller formula versus the synthetic
bed evolution after 35 days. Additionally, it entails the response surface (surrogate model).
Note that the parameter set with the highest likelihood was selected to generate these outputs in
Figure 5.1. Further, the horizontal axis shows the distance from the inlet boundary (738.5-km
of the lower Rhine), whereas the vertical axis represents the bed evolution.
This plot indicates that the surrogate model after the calibration stage was a suitable represen-
tation of the original numerical model.

Bayesian Model Selection for the Lower Rhine Model
Figure 5.2 demonstrates the PDFs of parameters, whose realizations (parameter sets) received
comparatively higher likelihoods along with their corresponding statistical characteristics. As
mentioned in Section 3.3, the remaining realizations after the calibration phase were used as
the prior knowledge for the validation step, in which the procedure was repeated with the con-
structed response surface in the calibration step and a different bed evolution data set. The
output of the surrogate model and the original numerical model for the realization with the
highest likelihood after the validation stage is illustrated in Figure 5.3.
Figure 5.3: Simulation output vs. response surface (validation-Meyer-Peter-Müller model)
The misﬁt between the original numerical model and its reduction (response surface) implies
that the reduced model in calibration was not a sufﬁcient approximation of the original numer-
ical model. The parameter distributions of the survived realizations after the bootstrap ﬁltering
(Section 3.2.2) using the validation dataset are shown in Figure 5.4.

The yielded distributions of the parameters, which were initially assumed to be uniform approx-
imately resemble the Gaussian (Normal) distribution.
Einstein-Brown Model: In the following, the diagrams for the hydro-morphodynamic numer-
ical model embedding Einstein-Brown formula for calculation of the bed-load transport are
presented. Figure 5.5 indicates that the surrogate model did not adequately represent the origi-
nal numerical model at some locations. This fact could be associated with the presence of some
degree of nonlinearity in the real model at these positions.

98
Bayesian Model Selection for the Lower Rhine Model
Figure 5.5: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Einstein-Brown model)
The probability density functions of the posterior parameter sets after the calibration step, shown
in Figure 5.6, reveals that all the parameters except the ﬂoodplain’s friction followed the rather
normal distribution. The reason can be associated to whether the ﬂoodplain was not inundated
often enough during the simulation period, so that there is no statistical signiﬁcance for the
friction ﬂoodplain parameter.
The posterior parameter sets and the surrogate model were used in the validation step. The
simulation output of the original models against the response surface for the most probable
parameter set is depicted in Figure 5.7. The response surface approximated the synthetic bed
evolutions more acceptably in comparison with the original model.

Bayesian Model Selection for the Lower Rhine Model
Comparing the posterior distribution of parameters after the calibration (Figure 5.6) and the val-
idation steps (Figure 5.7), one can conclude that more realizations passed the bootstrap ﬁltering
stage successfully after validation than calibration phase. This fact does not necessarily signify
that the realizations after the validation possessed higher likelihood weights than after the cal-
ibration. Further, the shapes of the PDFs are more concentrated and resemble that of normal
distributions.
Figure 5.8: The posterior PDF of parameters (validation-Einstein-Brown model)
Modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen Model:
Similar to other models, the surrogate model cor-
rectly represented the original numerical model (Figure 5.9). However, the original hydro-
morphodynamic model containing the modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen equation in Telemac-2d-
Sisyphe only exhibited better match between 3-km and 6-km after the inlet boundary.
Figure 5.10 illustrates the parameter distributions after the calibration. The initial uniform
shapes of parameters resulted in the less informative distributions with several peaks, i.e. the
realizations with relatively better likelihoods were concentrated around various values oppose
to the previous models.

The surrogate model, which was built using the calibration data set, was veriﬁed with another
synthetic bed evolution. The performance of this model against the original model via their
most probable parameter set is shown in Figure 5.11.
Figure 5.11: Simulation output vs. response surface (validation-Mod. Engelund-Hansen model)
The probability distribution functions of the parameters after the validation step (Figure 5.12)
display more concentrated peaks, providing additional instructive information about the most
probable region of parameters for the task of the optimization.

Van Rijn Model: The morphodynamic variant of the Van Rijn transport equation in Sisyphe
coupled with the hydrodynamic module (Telemac) could approximate the synthetic bed evolu-
tion of the lower Rhine satisfactorily, according to Figure 5.13. Moreover, the response surface,
constructed in the calibration phase, matched the output of the original numerical model similar
to all competing models.

Figure 5.13: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Van Rijn model)
The probability density functions of posterior parameter sets are illustrated in Figure 5.14. Con-
trary to the previously presented models, the distributions covered relatively larger regions of
the prescribed parameter ranges, suggesting that a large number of realizations received high
likelihood weights. This fact indicates that the simulated averaged bed evolution for many
parameter sets within the deﬁned parameter space were closer to the measurements.
Figure 5.15 displays the outputs of the original and reduced model for the parameter set with
the maximum likelihood weight. Even though the surrogate model from calibration step has not
been adapted to the new data set (validation data set), it presented a proper ﬁt with the synthetic
measurements.

The parameter distributions after the validation step were more concentrated in comparison to
that of calibration phase (Figure 5.14).
Hunziker Model: The simulation output of the Hunziker model against the corresponding re-
sponse surface, which is shown in Figure 5.17 indicates a close ﬁt between this model and its
reduced version (response surface) and the artiﬁcial measurement after the calibration stage.
Further, the probability distributions of the posterior parameters, presented in Figure 5.18, sig-
nify relatively focused formations.

As illustrated in Figure 5.19, the simulated bed evolution of the original numerical model suc-
ceeded in approximating the artiﬁcial bed evolution. The constructed response surface, how-
ever, in the calibration step was generally in good agreement with the validation bed develop-
ment.
The posterior probability distributions after the validation, shown in Figure Figure 5.20 , pro-
vides better guidance in locating the best parameter set identiﬁcation for the task of optimiza-
tion.

Wu Model: The hydro-morphodynamic model including the sediment transport of Wu et al.
(2000) was used to generate the artiﬁcial bed load evolution. As it is visible in Figure 5.21,
the synthetic measurement, the simulated bed evolution of the original model and the response
surface entirely overlapped, this indicates that the reduction model technique embedded in the
BMS framework was utterly successful in approximating the original model.

Figure 5.22 presents the probability density distributions of the parameters after the calibration
step. The dashed lines represent the values with the highest likelihood weights, whereas the
black lines show the parameter values used for generating the synthetic bed evolution for cal-
ibration data set. The non-distinguishable distribution shapes indicate that several parameters
received approximately similar likelihoods.
The simulated bed evolution of the original model and the surrogate model for the realization
with the highest likelihood after the validation step is presented in Figure 5.23.

The difference between the known parameter values (black lines) and the values of parameters
with highest density (dashed lines) for the calibration and validation steps are summarized in

The absolute value of discrepancy reduced for the mean sediment diameter, the friction co-

of the friction coefﬁcient of ﬂoodplain increased slightly. The biggest change of the discrep-
ancy belonged to the variable beta. This variation is not unexpected because the surrogate

113
model that also inﬂuences the likelihood assignment step was not adapted to the new synthetic
measurement data set. Moreover, several solutions might exist for one problem, i.e. different
parameter set might produce the same results; this is known as ill-posed problems. According
to Hadamard (1902), well-posed mathematical models of physical phenomena must possess
the properties that a unique solution exists, and its behavior varies continuously with the initial
condition, whereas the problems that are not well-posed are labeled ill-posed.
The validation step with smaller measurement error (0.025) was repeated to investigate the ef-
fect of the measurement error on the discussed discrepancies. The posterior probability density
distributions are presented in Figure 5.25, and the associated differences in parameters for the
initial measurement error and new error are presented in Table 5.4.

From the table above, it can be inferred that the smaller measurement error relatively improved
the accuracy of the identifying the most likely regions of variables for the task of optimization.
BME Comparison: As discussed in Section 3.3.1, Bayesian Model Evidence (BME) is a prod-
uct of Bayesian Model Averaging, also referred to as marginal likelihood or prior predictive of
the observed data based on the prior distribution of the parameters (Equation 3.12). The devel-
opment of BME values of the competing models against the iterations on the improvement of
their surrogate models (response surface) in calibration step is presented in Figure 5.26.

According to the graph above, the hydro-morphodynamic model including Wu equation ob-

and Hansen acquired considerably small BME values. However, the ﬁnal model ranking is
based on the BME values after the validation. Table 5.5 summarizes the BME values of the
variants after the validation step.

As it is evident from the table above, the model variant of Wu equation is the clear winner.
This fact is also in accordance with our ﬁnding for the model ranking after the calibration step.
Additionally, the Van Rijn model surpassed the Hunziker model in the validation step.
5.2 BMS of the Real Lower Rhine Model
The real bed evolution observation of the lower Rhine between 738.5 and 749.0 from 2002 to
2004 and from 2004 to 2006 shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14 were introduced to the frame-
work as the calibration and validation measurements, respectively. In this case, four competing
hydro-morphodynamic models were considered.
5.2.1 Setup and Implementation
All the considered morphodynamic models, BMS framework’s inputs, as well as calibration
and validation scenarios are summarized in the following sections.
Examined Hydro-Morphodynamic Models: The selected sediment transport formulae for the
morphodynamic models in the real test of the numerical model of the lower Rhine is summa-
rized in Table 5.6.

Measurement Error, Sample Size and number of Iterations: Similar to the twin experiment,
the measurement error of 0.05 and ensembles of 20,000 realizations per model were deﬁned.
Contrary to the twin experiment, ﬁve iterations of Bayesian updating were prescribed for each
model.
Stochastic Calibration and Validation Scenarios: The models were stochastically calibrated,
and validated within two different periods of two years. Section 2.4 presented the measured bed
evolution plots, the derivation method, and all other speciﬁcations.
5.2.2 Bayesian Model Ranking for the Real lower Rhine Model
The following section includes the output of the BMS for the numerical model of the lower
Rhine with real bed evolution for all four rival hydro-morphodynamic models. The remaining
results are presented in a separate section in Appendix II.

117
Meyer-Peter-Müller Model: The plot in Figure 5.27 illustrate the simulation output of the
hydro-morphodynamic model including the Meyer-Peter-Müller equation for the bed-load
transport rate and the bed evolution measurement from 2002 to 2004. Furthermore, the blue
curve signiﬁes the constructed response surface considering the parameter set with the highest
likelihood after the calibration phase.
Figure 5.27: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Meyer-Peter-Müller model)
As it is visible from Figure 5.27, the updated response surface after ﬁve iterations could reason-
ably capture the pattern of the original hydro-morphodynamic model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe
but was not utterly successful in representing its magnitude.
Figure 5.28 displays the probability density function (PDF) of the posterior distribution of un-
certain parameters along with their statistical moments.

As mentioned previously, the likelihood weights of the prior realization for the validation stage
were assigned based on the validation measurements (the measurement period of 2004 to 2006).
Figure 5.29 illustrate the simulation output and the performance range of the response surface
for the parameter set with the highest likelihood after the validation step. Figure 5.30 shows the
probability density function (PDF) of the posterior distribution of uncertain parameters after
validation step.

Van Rijn Model: Figure 5.31 illustrates the measured bed evolution versus the original model’s
simulation output and the response surface using the most probable parameter set in the cali-
bration step. According to this graph, the response surface could not approximate the original
model before the ﬁfth kilometer from the inlet boundary correctly, particularly the peak values.
However, this misﬁt changed signiﬁcantly towards the outlet edge.
Figure 5.31: Simulation output vs. response surface (calibration-Van Rijn model)
The posterior information on best parameter sets in the calibration stage was utilized as the
prior knowledge on the distribution of the parameters for the validation step. Additionally, the
enlargement of the prior ensembles was conducted. Figure 5.32 shows the simulation output and
the performance range of the response surface for the parameter set with the highest likelihood
in the validation step.

Similar to the calibration phase (Figure 5.31), the constructed surrogate model did not embrace
the peaks. Note that the algorithm has not modiﬁed the response surface in the validation step.

Hunziker Model: The outcomes of the hydro-morphodynamic model involving the bed-load
transport rate of Hunziker (1995) are presented in the following section. Figure 5.35 shows the
model’s simulation output against the response surface after calibration step using the parameter
set with the highest likelihood. According to this graph, the performance range (the gray area) of
the ﬁnal response surface after ﬁve iterations contained the simulated bed evolution at numerous
measurement locations.
Figure 5.36 demonstrate the PDFs of the posterior distribution of uncertain parameters after the
calibration step.

measurement period.

Wu Model: As shown in Figure 5.39, the response surface built in the Bayesian framework
could capture the overall pattern, but it slightly failed in disclosing the magnitude of the original
model in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe. The performance range of the response surface (the gray area in
Figure 5.39) was considerably small due to few remaining parameter sets passed the rejection
sampling stage in the calibration stage. This fact also expressed in the posterior probability
density function in Figure 5.40.

Figure 5.41 demonstrates the simulation output and the performance of the response surface for
the parameter set with the highest likelihood in the validation step. Similar to the calibration
case, the performance range is narrow, suggesting that the output of response surface for all the
parameter sets after validation had a small variance.
Figure 5.41: Simulation output vs. response surface (validation-Wu model)
Considering the performance range of the surrogate model (Figure 5.41) and the posterior PDF
of the parameters in Figure 5.42, the response surface behaved similarly for a relatively wide
range of the values for the friction coefﬁcient of the main channel and the secondary current
alpha coefﬁcient.

BME Comparison: The development of BME values of the competing models over the it-
erations on the improvement of the response surface (surrogate model) is depicted in Figure
5.43.

(Log-scale)
The diagram in Figure 5.43 indicates that the likelihoods have undergone a rapid decline after
the ﬁrst iteration on the improvement of the response surface, but enhanced gradually afterward.
This incident could be associated with the nonlinear nature of the original model or the response
surface was updated with incorrect information from the oiginal model’s output. Additionally,
the BME rates (Equation 3.13) after the validation stage is listed in Table 5.8.

The hydro-morphodynamic model containing the Hunziker bed-load transport rate displayed
more acceptable performance in comparison to its competing model after the validation (Fig-

ure 5.38). This model, however, was ranked as the second favorable model in the calibration
stage. Given the fact that the curve representing two best-performed models are close, it is
likely that if more iterations on the improvement of response surface were taken into accounts,
the performance of the Hunziker model could overpass that of the Van Rijn model. Figure
5.44 demonstrate the simulated bed evolution using the Hunziker bed-load equation. The red
areas stand for the deposition spots, and the erosion occurred in the blue sections. Comparing
this simulation result with Figure 2.12, it is evident that the numerical overestimated the bed
evolution.
Figure 5.44: Simulated bed evolution with Hunziker model with bed evolution from 2002 to 2004
By comparing the presented graphs of the other rival model variants, the following conclusions
can be drawn:
• It is evident that the constructed response surface failed, to some extent, in capturing the
original model’s behavior.
• The adequate local representation of the original model via response surfaces for all mod-
els at the inlet and outlet of the study area and their distances from the measurements indi-

5.3 Summary
131
cates that the real numerical model failed in matching the historical data at the boundaries.
This situation could stem from the uncertainty in boundary conditions.
• The fact that the simulation output from the original numerical model in Telemac-2d-
Sisyphe fell in the performance range of the surrogate model of the morphodynamic in-
cluding Hunziker equation as shown in Figure 5.38 and they were in a more fair distance
to the measurement reveal that this model was more favorable comparing to its other
competitors.
• For some models in the real case of lower Rhine model, the surrogate model is at signiﬁ-
cant distance from the original simulations than for others. In that case, if the surrogate is
closer to the measurements than its original model it will be ranked higher than it should
and BMS is "unfair".
5.3 Summary
The presented chapter included the results of the model selection for the numerical model of
the 10-km river reach of the lower Rhine in Telemac-2d-Sisyphe software, provided by BAW
in Karlsruhe. The Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) for this river model was implemented
considering two different scenarios. First, the BMS was conducted by benchmarking with a
synthetic test case, in which measurement for a short period was taken into consideration. Then,
real bed evolution of a two-year term was inserted in the BMS framework.
The framework successfully ranked the model used for the generation of the synthetic measure-
ment. Additionally, the comparison of the probability density distributions of parameters for the
ﬁrst rated model with the known parameter values could direct us to the most probable region of
the most variables with an acceptable precision. The accuracy of the calibration parameter set
inference of the proposed approach needs to be investigated in detail by employing scenarios of
twin experiment with varying measurement errors.
In model selection for the case with the real measurement of the lower Rhine, the hydro-
morphodynamic including Hunziker equation was ranked in the ﬁrst place among four different
models. As shown in Figure 5.37, the simulation output from the original numerical model in
Telemac-2d-Sisyphe and the surrogate model of the selected morphodynamic model were in a
more acceptable range of the measurement comparing to its other opponents.

6 Summary and Conclusions
In the ﬁeld of river engineering, hydro-morphodynamic history matching, in which the model
simulations are adjusted to reproduce the past measurements, demands a remarkably sound
expertise of the processes under investigation.
The difﬁculty includes the selection of the
best model among the available variants. Moreover, the non-trivial task of identifying the
matched parameters within the model can expressively complicate the history matching pro-
cess. Addressing these issues, this master’s thesis established a Bayesian Model Selection
(BMS) framework that assists even less experienced modeler to rank different available hydro-
morphodynamic models according to their predictive abilities.
This chapter presents all the ﬁndings and the conclusions of the current research, as well as
some recommendations. Section 6.1 provides a summary of this report, in which the state-
ment of the problem, the framework’s concepts and properties, and the veriﬁcation tests are
described. Afterward, the conclusions that are drawn from the results presented in the previous
chapters are listed in Section 6.2. Finally, Section 6.3 entails some recommendations for further
investigations.
6.1 Thesis Summary
Problem Statement: Water currents in natural rivers cause riverbed scour, particles (heavier
than water) movement and material depositions, creating the bed topography changes. This
phenomenon is called ﬂuvial hydro-morphodynamics, in which sediment transport plays the
major role, as shown in Section 2.1. According to Apsley (2014), the reasons that sediment
transport phenomenon is of great importance in river engineering include but are not limited to
risk assessment of scouring of bridges, weirs and channel banks; estimation of the siltation in
an upstream reservoir of a dam; prediction of possible bed topographical changes of rivers and
estuaries.
Considering the deﬁnitions of Einstein (1950) and Vanoni (2006), there are two distinct trans-
port modes of sediments in a river, namely Bed-load transport and Suspended-load transport.

6.1 Thesis Summary
133
In the former, the sediment particles relocate via a rolling, sliding or leaping movement with
a distance of a few grain sizes, also known as saltation, and are in continual contact with the
channel bed. In the latter case, however, turbulent forces in the water uphold the particles, al-
lowing them to be transmitted over considerable distances without touching the riverbed. Many
ﬂuvial research and management applications focus more on the estimation of bed-load because
it governs the morphology of streams’ bed.
Bed-load transport formulations correspond ﬂow discharge to bed load transport. They demon-
strate a vastly spatially and temporally variable phenomenon. These equations are copious and
used extensively in both applied and theoretical studies. Gomez and Church (1989), who con-
ducted the most comprehensive assessment of bed load formulae to date, state that there are
more bed load equations in existence than there are reliable data to test them. Consequently,
none or even few equations have been recognized as being particularly appropriate for desig-
nated application in many hydro-morphodynamic investigations. Hence, the challenge is the
determination of the best model that describes the morphodynamic condition of a river in any
modeling exercise.
Not only does the model selection for the hydro-morphodynamic modeling requires lots of
expertise, but the determination of calibration model parameters also makes it even more com-
plicated. To address these issues, the current study offered a framework that assists less ex-
perienced modeler to rank different available models according to their capability of future
predictions and simultaneously leads the user to the most probable region of parameters for
calibration of the corresponding models.
Description of offered Solution: This study suggested a Bayesian Model Selection (BMS)
framework to direct the modeler towards the most robust and sensible representation of the
hydro-morphodynamic conditions of the river under investigation. The proposed framework
considers Bayesian Model Evidence (BME) as a model evaluation yardstick for ranking com-
peting models. BMS performs a compromise between bias and variance, i.e. it blends a measure
for goodness of ﬁt with a penalty for unacceptable model complexity. Derived in a Bayesian
context, BME not only accounts for measurement errors in the calibration data but it also takes
parameters’ uncertainty into consideration. Ergo, BME is superbly appropriate in the assess-
ment of model’s quality under uncertainty.
BME is closely connected with model weights in the context of Bayesian model selection.
Computing the BMEs, the biased free numerical method of "Simple Monte Carlo Integration"
(Schöniger et al., 2014) was used. The prior deﬁnition of the parameter space is a criterion for
a reliable, accurate approximation of BME. To tackle this issue, an advanced model reduction
technique, surrogate model (response surface), has been employed, attained via the arbitrary

134
Summary and Conclusions
polynomial chaos expansion (aPC). This aPC-based approach does not have any restrictions
on the shapes of distributions and can process even less informative distributions. With this
response surface framework, usually high computational costs of proper ﬁltering of the prior
distributions of parameters became viable for quantiﬁcation of the model uncertainty.
To adapt the surrogate model to the original numerical model and avoid misleading inferences of
parameter ranges, the toolkit encompasses an iterative approach to improvement of the response
surface. A ﬂowchart summary of the procedure in the BMS toolkit was presented in Figure 3.1.
Implementation in Case Studies: To evaluate the functionality of proposed framework, two
case studies were conducted; namely a test case channel bend model, based on an experiment
done by Yen and Lee (1995) and a river model of the lower Rhine, provided by the Federal Wa-
terways Research Institute (BAW) in Karlsruhe. The channel bend model has been constructed
based on a laboratory experiment in an 180-degree channel bend to investigate bed topography
and crosswise sediment sorting in a channel bend under unsteady ﬂow conditions. The second
case study was performed on a river model of the Lower Rhine at Düsseldorf/Neuss (Rhine-km
739.0 to Rhine-km 749.0), which has an intense meandering with two close meandering curves
and active bed-load transport.
The hydro-morphodynamic models of the two case studies have been constructed in the
TELEMAC-MASCARET (www.telemac.org) simulation software, which is an open-source
integrated suite of solvers for simulation in the ﬁeld of free surface ﬂow (Hervouet (2000)).
Firstly, the hydrodynamic module, TELEMAC-2D derives the hydrodynamic conditions via
solving the shallow water equations and then the morphodynamic modeling by the morphody-
namic module, SISYPHE takes place, whose output is the bed evolution, calculated by Exner
equation (Equation 2.4). The coupling between the hydrodynamic (Telemac-2d) and morphody-
namic (Sisyphe) modules is also regarded. Additionally, bed slope effect and secondary current
effect modify the bed evolution.
6.2 Conclusions
The results of BMS for the ﬁrst test case; i.e. Channel bend, was presented in Chapter 4. As
mentioned in Section 2.3, the models were calibrated using measurements in one cross section
and validated with the observation locations at another cross section, due to lack of enough data
time series.
In the calibration stage, only few parameter sets survived for the model including the modiﬁed
bed-load equation of Engelund-Hansen, suggesting that large number of the prior parameter

135
sets performed poorly. This explains why its average likelihood (BME) was the lowest and
the model was placed in the last rank after the calibration. However, this model scored best in
the validation step, because little uncertainty remained after the calibration. Further, none of
the other models yielded a better ﬁt, and along with a small uncertainty, this model obtained
the highest rank. On the contrary, the morphodynamic model containing the Van Rijn bed
load equation was placed in the last rank among other competing models in the validation step,
though it was ranked as the second in the calibration phase.
To investigate the impact of various prior information of sensitive parameters, i.e. different
mean values and variances, on the outcome of BME with limited calibration and validation
datasets for the channel bend model, BMS was repeated for 100 times; i.e. slightly dissimilar
prior distributions. The standard deviation of BME values in calibration were remarkably lower
than in validation step. This fact indicates that the Bayesian model selection using the measure-
ments at the 90 degrees of the bend is less sensitive to the prior distributions of parameters than
at 180 degrees of channel.
The results of uncertainty analysis also revealed that morphodynamic models of Van Rijn and
modiﬁed Engelund-Hansen were ranked as the best and the worst models after the calibration
step, respectively. Whereas, the morphodynamic model with the modiﬁed bed-load transport
equation of Engelund-Hansen was performed better than its rival after the validation. Therefore,
one can conclude that less representative surrogate model of the original morphodynamic model
of Van Rijn in the calibration stage led to unreal BMEs, and the posterior model weight of this
model after validation with another data set decreased.
The main contribution of this thesis was the BMS for the real-world river model for the lower
Rhine. First, the BMS of the benchmarking test case with a synthetic bed evolution measure-
ment was performed, where an exact solution was known. The BMS toolkit successfully led
us to the known solution, which was the model used to generate the artiﬁcial bed evolution
observations. Additionally, the posterior distributions of parameters navigated us to the most
probable regions of the parameters for deterministic calibration, which were roughly near the
unique parameter set used for the artiﬁcial bed evolution. Investigating the impact of the mea-
surement error speciﬁed that lower measurement error values results in more precise parameter
inferences.
Secondly, the BMS was performed for the river model with real measured bed developments
for two data sets from 2002 to 2004 and 2004 to 2006. The hydro-morphodynamic embedding
the Hunziker bed load equation was labeled as the superior model obtaining a posterior model
weight of nearly 100% (BME = 1).
Overall, the ﬁndings and conclusions of this study can be summarized as following:

Summary and Conclusions
• The suggested BMS toolkit can provide a reasonable guidance in the task of model selection
for hydro-morphodynamic models by providing a ranking of competing models considering
a global measure of model quality.
• This framework can roughly direct the user to the most probable parameter regions for the
further task of optimization via probability density distributions of uncertain variables. The
nature of problem in hydro-morphodynamic modeling can be identiﬁed as ill-posed. In these
problems, a unique solution might not exist, i.e. more parameter sets produce the same output.
• The reduced model derived from response surface framework can adequately represent the
original numerical model and can be considered in the task of history matching to reduce the
computational costs of optimization with the try-and-error approach.
• Better surrogate models allow a more authentic BMS ranking. Here, the model selection
toolkit was limited to linear surrogate models, and this could be improved in future studies.
• Model ranking based on BMS becomes more reliable, when surrogate models are closer to
the actual models. On the other hand, if the original model is to be used but it is computa-
tionally expensive, it leads to undesirable statistics and the estimated BME value again is not
representative. Therefore, a compromise must be taken into account between the reliability
of the model ranking and the computational costs of total required simulations of original
model.
• BMS performs a trade-off between model performance and complexity. Before calibration,
some models might have larger parameter uncertainty than others. Consequently, they are
penalized much harder. This effect might diminish after calibration. Hence, getting different
model ranking in calibration and validation is not "bad" per se.
• Using more calibration and validation data sets eliminates the discrepancy in the selection of
the best-performed model after the calibration and validation steps.
• Instability of some models hindered the model selection process. Therefore, the preference
of the user for working with a particular model needs to be taken into accounts in the BME
approximation.

6.3 Recommendations for Further Investigations

6.3 Recommendations for Further Investigations
The following recommendations for further studies can be suggested to improve the proposed
BMS toolkit of this study.
• In the present study, a linear surrogate model was used to approximate the original mathe-
matical model. Introducing additional terms to the linear model can account for any degree
of possible nonlinearity in the original system.
• The Simple Monte Carlo integration approach was used in this study for BME calculation.
However, other available numerical BME approximation methods can also be compared in a
separate study.
• The impact of measurement error on model ranking and parameter inference ability of frame-
work can be explored using benchmarking with different scenarios on test cases (twin exper-
iment).
• The impact of enough measurement data was addressed brieﬂy in this thesis. This effect can
be studied further with implementing different scenarios in a benchmarking test.
• The toolkit features a possibility of assigning different measurement errors to some observa-
tion locations. Since there are uncertainties in inlet and outlet boundaries of numerical models
of natural rivers, the impact of allocating higher weights to these regions to account for the
uncertainties in BME approximation.
