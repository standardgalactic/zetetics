 TWO SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR POISSON
 APPROXIMATIONS IN THE FERROMAGNETIC ISING MODEL
 By David Coupier
 Universit? Lille 1
 A ?/-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model on a lattice torus is consid
 ered. As the size of the lattice tends to infinity, two conditions ensuring a
 Poisson approximation for the distribution of the number of occurrences in
 the lattice of any given local configuration are suggested. The proof builds
 on the Stein-Chen method. The rate of the Poisson approximation and the
 speed of convergence to it are defined and make sense for the model. Thus,
 the two sufficient conditions are traduced in terms of the magnetic field and
 the pair potential. In particular, the Poisson approximation holds even if both
 potentials diverge.
 1. Introduction. Suppose {Ia)aer is a finite family of indicator random vari
 ables, with the properties that the probabilities P(/a = 1) are small and that there is
 not too much dependence between the Ia 's. Then, "the law of small numbers" says
 the sum Xlaer ?a should have approximately a Poisson distribution. The "birthday
 problem" and its variants (see Chen [5]), the theory of random graphs (see Bol
 lob?s [3] for a general reference or the famous paper of Erd?s and R?nyi [11])
 and the study of words in long DNA sequences (see, e.g., Schbath [18]) are exam
 ples in which a law of small numbers takes place. As the situation studied in this
 paper, these examples can be viewed as problems of increasing size (i.e., the car
 dinality of r tends to infinity) in which the sum ^2aer i a has a Poisson limit. Two
 methods are often used for proving Poisson approximations; the moment method
 (see [3], page 25) and the Stein-Chen method (see Arratia, Goldstein and Gor
 don [1], Barbour, Hoist and Janson [2] for a very complete reference, or [5] for
 the original paper of Chen). The second one offers two main advantages. Only the
 first two moments need to be computed and a bound of the rate of convergence
 is obtained. However, the Stein-Chen method requires to restrict our attention to
 variables which satisfy the FKG inequality [14]. This is the case of spins of a
 ferromagnetic Ising model.
 Let us consider a lattice graph in dimension d > 1, with periodic boundary
 conditions (lattice torus). The vertex set is Vn = {0,..., n - l}d. The integer n
 will be called the size of the lattice. The edge set, denoted by En, will be specified

 POISSON APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE ISING MODEL

 by defining the set of neighbors V(x) of a given vertex x:
 (1) V(x) = {y^xeVn,\\y-x\\p<p),
 where the substraction is taken componentwise modulo n, || \\p stands for the
 Lp norm in Rd (1 < p < oo), and p is a fixed parameter. For instance, the square
 lattice is obtained for p = p = 1. Replacing the L i norm by the L norm adds the
 diagonals. From now on, all operations on vertices will be understood modulo n. In
 particular, each vertex of the lattice has the same number of neighbors; we denote
 by V this number.
 A configuration is a mapping from the vertex set Vn to the state space {?1, +1}.
 Their set is denoted by Xn = {?1, +l}Vn and called the configuration set. The
 Ising model is classically defined as follows (see, e.g., Georgii [16] and Malyshev
 and Minios [17]).
 Definition 1.1. Let Gn = (Vn, En) be the undirected graph structure with
 finite vertex set Vn and edge set En. Let a and b be two reals. The Ising model with
 parameters a and b is the probability measure ?xa? on Xn = {?1, +l}Vn defined
 by: Va g Xn,
 (2) pab(a) = ?? exp?a J2a^ + b Jl cr(x)a(y)\,
 a'b V xeV? {x,y}eEn I
 where the normalizing constant Za? is such that YloeXn ?aMa) = 1
 Following the definition of Malyshev and Minios ([17], page 2), the measur
 ?jLa,b defined above is a Gibbs measure associated to potentials a and b. Expecta
 tions relative to ?a,b will be denoted by Efl^.
 In the classical presentation of statistical physics, the elements of Xn are spin
 configurations; each vertex of Vn is an atom whose spin is either positive or nega
 tive. Here, we shall simply talk about positive or negative vertices instead of posi
 tive or negative spins and we shall merely denote by + and ? the states +1 and ? 1
 The parameters a and b are, respectively, the magnetic field and the pair potentia
 The model remaining unchanged by swapping positive and negative vertices and
 replacing a by ?a, we chose to study only negative values of the magnetic field a.
 Moreover, throughout the paper, the pair potential b will be supposed nonnegative
 Many laws of small numbers have been already proved for the Ising mode
 They are obtained in two different contexts; the low temperature case (i.e., b larg
 enough) and the large magnetic field case. Chazottes and Redig [4] have obtained
 Poisson law for the number of occurrences of large cylindrical events. Their resu
 concerns the low temperature case and is based on an argument of disagreement
 percolation. Fern?ndez, Ferrari and Garcia [12] have established the asymptot
 Poisson distribution of contours in the nearest-neighbor Ising model at low tem
 perature and zero magnetic field. In the same context, Ferrari and Picco [13] hav

 applied the Stein-Chen method to obtain bounds on the total variation distance
 between the law of large contours and a Poisson process. Ganesh et al. [15] have
 studied the Ising model for positive and fixed values of b. Provided the magnetic
 field a tends to infinity, they proved that the distribution of the number of negative
 vertices is approximately Poisson. In Coupier [6], we have generalized this result
 to (deterministic) objects more elaborated than a single vertex, called the local
 configurations', but the parameter b was still fixed.
 Our goal is to extend these Poisson approximations to values of the pair poten
 tial b not necessarily bounded. In particular, we establish a law of small numbers
 in the case where both magnetic field a and pair potential b diverge. Moreover,
 compared with the previous articles, the results of this paper offer two advantages.
 First, the roles of the rate of the Poisson approximation and the speed of con
 vergence to it are conceptually clearer. Second, the method of the proof is more
 elementary and simple than those of the previous references; it does not require
 the need of auxiliary birth-and-death processes as in [12] and [13], or of activity
 expansions as in [15].
 Pattern recognition and image denoising problems motivate the study realized
 in this paper. Indeed, Desolneux, Moisan and Morel (see [9] and [10]) describe
 and detect the geometric structures of an image through the notion of "meaningful
 events." Their method is based on the link between the perception threshold of
 a given visual structure and its probability of appearance in a random image. In
 Coupier, Desolneux and Ycart [7], a Poisson approximation for the probability
 of appearance of any local pattern is computed in the case of independent pixels.
 This result leads to a denoising algorithm for gray-level images. However, the
 structures created by the noise are generally more irregular (with a large perimeter)
 than the natural ones of an image. This remark justifies our interest for Poisson
 approximations in probabilistic models with dependent pixels, as the Ising model.
 We are interested in the occurrences in the graph Gn of a fixed local configura
 tion ?] (see Section 2 for a precise definition and Figure 1 for an example). Such a
 configuration is called "local" in the sense that the vertex set on which it is defined
 is fixed and does not depend on n. Its number of occurrences in Gn is denoted by
 -: +
 + :-;+ +
 FIG. 1. A local configuration n with k(r)) = \ V+(r?)| = 10 positive vertices and a perimeter 
 equal to 58, in dimension d = 2 and on a ball of radius r = 2 (with p = 1 and relative to the

 POISSON APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE ISING MODEL

 Xn(r]). A local configuration r? is determined by its set of positive vertices V+(r))
 whose cardinality and perimeter are respectively denoted by k(rj) and y(t]). As
 the size n of the lattice tends to infinity, the potentials a = a(n) and b = b(n)
 depend on n. The case where a(n) tends to ? oo corresponds to rare positive ver
 tices among a majority of negative ones. In order to simplify formulas, the Gibbs
 measure ?JLa(n)Mn) wiU be merely denoted by ?a,b
 A natural idea consists in regarding both potentials a(n) and b(n) through the
 same quantity: the weight of the local configuration r?
 Wn(ri) = cxp(2a(n)k(r1) - 2b(n)y(r])).
 Actually, the weight Wn(r?) represents the probabilistic cost associated to a given
 occurrence of r? and, consequently, the product ndWn(r]) (where nd is the cardi
 nality of Vn) corresponds to the expected number of occurrences of rj in the whole
 graph Gn. Hence, in order to obtain a Poisson approximation for the random vari
 able Xn(r?) it is needed that the weight Wn(r?) tends to 0 at the rate n~d. Therefore,
 throughout this paper, the potentials a(n) and b(n) will satisfy the homogeneity re
 lation
 (3) ndWn(r]) = X,
 where ? is a positive constant. Two other parameters naturally take place in our
 study: the probability gap An(rj) and the maximality probability &n(r]). When the
 first one tends to 0, the vertices surrounding a given occurrence of r] are all nega
 tive. A null limit for the second one means if somewhere in the graph the vertices
 corresponding to the set V+(r?) are positive, then locally they are the only ones. The
 fact that the probability gap An(r?) and the maximality probability ?n(r?) tend to 0
 is denoted by (HI). We denote by (H2) the following (interpreted) hypothesis: "the
 probability for a given configuration ? e { ?, +}v, V C Vn, to occur is bounded by
 its weight Wn(?)" Our main result (Theorem 3.1) describes the asymptotic be
 havior of the number of occurrences of rj in the lattice. Added to the necessary
 condition (3), the two hypotheses (HI) and (H2) imply the total variation distance
 between the distribution of the random variable Xn(t]) and the Poisson distribution
 with parameter ? satisfies
 dTY(X(Xn(r1)), ?P(\)) = 0(max{A?(r?), ?n(r,)}).
 The proof is based on the Stein-Chen method. Lemma 4.1 reduces the proof to
 a sum of increasing random indicators Xn(rj). Since the Gibbs measure iia,b de
 fined in (2) satisfies the FKG inequality (because the pair potential b is positive),
 this method is applied to the random variable Xn(r?) and produces Lemma 4.5.
 Then, bounds on the first two moments of Xn(r?) (Lemmas 4.2 and 4.6) allow to
 conclude.
 Finally, Theorem 3.1 is completed by a second result (Proposition 3.2) which
 traduces the two hypotheses (HI) and (H2) in terms of magnetic field a(n) and
 pair potential b(n).

 The paper is organized as follows. The notion of local configuration r? is defined
 in Section 2. Its number of positive vertices k(rj), its perimeter y(rj) and its weight
 Wn(rj) are also introduced. The use of the local energy of r\ (Definition 2.1) allows
 to write the conditional probability for rj to occur in the graph in terms of weights
 (Lemma 2.2). Lemma 2.4 is the main result of Section 2. It provides lower and
 upper bounds for_this conditional probability on which the estimates of the first
 two moments of Xn(rj) are based. In Section 3, Theorem 3.1 and hypotheses (HI)
 and (H2) are introduced and discussed. Thus, Proposition 3.2 is illustrated by two
 examples. Finally, Section 4, in which the sum Xn(tf) is defined, is devoted to the
 proof of Theorem 3.1.
 2. Conditional probability of a local configuration. Let us start with some
 notation and definitions. Given ? e Xn = {?, +}Vn and V c Vn, we denote by ?y
 the natural projection of ? over {?, +}v. If U and V are two disjoint subsets of Vn,
 then ?u?y *s ^e configuration oni/UV which is equal to ? on U and ? ' on V.
 Let us denote by 8 V the neighborhood of V [corresponding to (1)]:
 8V = {yeVn\V,3xeV,{x,y}eEn],
 and by V the union of the two disjoint sets V and SV. Moreover, \V\ denotes
 the cardinality of V and !F(V) the a -algebra generated by the configurations of
 {-,+}v.
 As usual, the graph distance dist is defined as the minimal length of a path
 between two vertices. We shall denote by B(x, r) the ball of center x and radius r :
 B(x, r) = {y e Vn; dist(jc, y) < r}.
 In the case of balls, B(x, r) = B(x, r + 1). In order to avoid unpleasant situations,
 like self-overlapping balls, we will always assume that n > 2pr. If n and nf are
 both larger than 2pr, the balls B(x, r) in Gn and Gn> are isomorphic. Two prop
 erties of the balls B(x, r) will be crucial in what follows. The first one is that two
 balls with the same radius are translates of each other:
 B(x + y,r) = y + B(x,r).
 The second one is that for n > 2pr, the cardinality of B(x, r) depends only on r
 and neither on x nor on?: it will be denoted by ?(r). The same is true for the
 number of edges {y, z] e En with y,ze B(x, r), which will be denoted by a(r).
 Let r be a positive integer, and consider a fixed ball with radius r, say B(0, r).
 We denote by Gr = {?, +}?^0r) the set of configurations on that ball. Elements
 of Gr will be called local configurations of radius r, or merely local configurations
 whenever the radius r will be fixed. Of course, there exists only a finite number
 of such configurations (precisely 2^(r)). See Figure 1 for an example. Throughout
 this paper, the radius r will be constant, that is, it will not depend on the size n.
 Hence, defining local configurations on balls of radius r serves only to ensure that

 studied objects are "local." In what follows, r?, rj' will denote local configurations
 of radius r.
 A local configuration r] e Cr is determined by its subset V+(rj) C B(0, r) of
 positive vertices:
 V+(r1) = {xeB(0,r),r1(x) = +}.
 The cardinality of this set will be denoted by k(rj) and its complementary set in
 5(0, r), that is, the set of negative vertices of 77, by V-(rj). Moreover, the geometry
 (in the sense of the graph structure) of the set V+(r?) needs to be described. Let us
 define the perimeter y(rj) of the local configuration r? by the formula
 yfo) = V| V+001 - 2\{{x,y) e V+Oj) x V+fo), {x,y} e En}\,
 where V is the number of neighbors of a vertex. In other words, y(rj) counts the
 pairs of neighboring vertices x and y of B(0, r) having opposite spins (under r?)
 and those such that x e B(0, r), y e 8B(0, r) and r?(x) = +. Finally, we denote by
 Wn(rj) and call the weight of the local configuration r] the following quantity:
 Wn(ri) = txp{2a(n)k(r]) - 2b(n)y(r1)).
 Since a(n) < 0 and b(n) > 0, the weight Wn(rj) satisfies 0 < Wn(r]) < 1. That of
 the local configuration having only negative vertices, denoted by 77o and called the
 null local configuration, is equal to 1. If rj ^ rp, then k(r?) > 1 and y(rj) > V. It
 follows that
 Wn(r]) < exp(2a(n) - 2b(n)V).
 Actually, the weight Wn(rj) represents the probabilistic cost associated to the pres
 ence of r] on a given ball. Lemma 2.4 will give a rigorous sense to this idea.
 Remark that the notation k(-), y(-) and Wn(-) can be naturally extended to any
 configuration fe{?,+}v, V c Vn. Furthermore, the configuration of {?, +}v
 having no positive vertex will be said to be null and denoted by f?.
 Let rj e Cr. For each vertex x eVn, denote by rjx the translation of rj onto the
 ball B(x, r) (up to periodic boundary conditions):
 VyeVn dist(0,)0<r => r?x(x + y) = r?(y).
 In particular, ^+(77^) =x + V+(rj). So, rj and rjx have the same number of positive
 vertices and the same perimeter. So do their weights. Let us denote by Ix the
 indicator function defined on Xn as follows: Ix (a) is 1 if the restriction of the
 configuration a e Xn to the ball B(x,r) is rjx and 0 otherwise. Finally, let us
 define the random variable Xn(rj) which counts the number of copies of the local
 configuration rj in Gn :
 xeVn
 Due to periodicity, this sum consists of nd indicator functions Ix, which have
 the same distribution. Hence, in order to understand the behavior of the random

 the reason why the rest of this section is devoted to the study of the probability for
 j) (or r\x) to occur on a ball B(x, r) knowing what happens on its neighborhood:
 (4) fiaM^lWmxs)).
 Besides, let us remark that the expected number of occurrences of the local con
 figuration rj in the graph can be expressed as the following expectation:
 ?a9b[Xn(ri)]=Ea9b[ndi;]
 = Ea,b[ndfia,b(I? = l\!F(8B))],
 where x is a given vertex and B denotes merely the ball B(x, r). Here, iia,b(Ix ?
 \\3T(8B)) represents a !F(8B)-measurable random variable and, for any configu
 ration a of {?, +}8B, ?a,b(Ix = l\!F(8B))(a) is equal to the conditional proba
 bility/^(/i = l|a).
 Lemma 2.4 provides inequalities between the conditional probability (4) and
 the weight Wn(r?). A way to link these two quantities consists in using the local
 energy of rj. Let us start with the following definition.
 Definition 2.1. Let V c Vn and f g {-, +}v. The local energy Hv(?) of
 the configuration ? on the set V is defined by
 HV(?) = a(n) J2 ?O0 + b(n) ? f (y)?(z),
 yeV [y,z}eEn
 (yeV)v(zeV)
 where (y e V) v (z e V) means at least one of the two vertices y and z belongs to
 V (the other might belong to its neighborhood 8 V).
 Let us fix a vertex x and denote by B the ball B(x, r). On the one hand, remark
 that for any a e {?, +}8B the local energy HB(rjxa) on B of the configuration
 which is equal to r)x on B and a on 8B gives an explicit formula of the conditional
 probability ^a,bUx = M<r)>

 On the other hand, the exponential of the local energy of rj can be expressed as a
 function of the weight Wn(rf). Indeed, HB(rjxa) is equal to

 In the case where z ? B (i.e., z e SB), the edge {y, z} is consistently counted by
 y (r]). In other words, the following equality holds:
 (8) 2y(r]) = a(r)- ? rjAy^Az) + ? (l + ^OO).

 So, the perimeter y(rj) can be inserted in the expression o

 Remark that the previous identity remains valid replacing the ball B with any given
 set V and the configuration r?xa with any given ? e { ?, +}v.

 Finally, it suffices to remark that the latter exponential does not depend on r\'x and
 to simplify the right-hand side of (11). D
 Let V and Vf be two disjoint subsets of vertices. The following relations:
 *(??') = *(?) + *(?') and j/(ff') < y(?) + y(f')
 are true whatever the configurations ? g {?, +}v and f ' g {?, +}v'. The connec
 tion between ? g {-, +}v and f ' G {-, +}v', denoted by conn(f, ?')> is defined
 by
 conn(f, f') = |{{y, z}eEn,yeV,ze V and f (y) = ?f(z) = +}|.
 This quantity allows to link the perimeters of the configurations ??f, ? and f '
 together:
 y(f f') + 2conn(?, f') = y (f ) + y (f'),
 and as a consequence their weights:
 (12) Wn(af)^W(-^(n)conn(?,^)) = Wn(?)Wn(^).
 In particular, if the connection conn(?, ? ') is null, then the weight Wn(??f) is equal
 to the product Wn(?)Wn(?'). This is the case when VC)V' = 0.
 Let B = B(x,r) and r] be a local configuration of radius r. Assume the set of
 positive vertices of r\ satisfies V+(r?) C B(0, r ? 1); such a local configuration is
 said to be clean. Then, the connection conn^, a) is null and Wn(r?xa) is equal
 to the product Wn(r?)Wn(a). This is the case also for the null configuration a0;
 Wn(r]xa0) = Wn(r])Wn(a0) = Wn{r,).
 Let us define the probability gap of t] and denote by An(r]) the quantity below:
 A , , Wn(rjxcr)
 An(rj) = max .
 aeSB Wn(rj)
 Since the weights of a configuration and its translates are equal, the probability
 gap An(r]) does not depend on the ball B = B(x, r) (nor on SB). It only depends
 on the local configuration r\ and on the potentials a(n) and b(n). Moreover, An(v?)
 satisfies the following inequalities:
 Lemma 2.3. Let r? eCr. Then, the probability gap An(rj) satisfies
 (13) cxp(2a(n) - 2b(n)V) < An(r]) < exp(2a(n)).
 In particular, for all r]' G Cr, r]' ^ ^?:
 Wn(x1f)<An(x1).

 PROOF. Let r? g Gr and as usual denote by B the ball B(x, r). Since a(n) < 0
 and b(n) > 0, the weight Wn(x?xcr) is a decreasing function of parameters k(x)xo)
 and y(x]xo). If a and of are two configurations of {?, +}8B, different from a0,
 such that V+(cr) c V+(<rO and k(a) = k(a') ? 1, then the perimeter y(x]xa) is
 not necessarily smaller than y(x]xcrf). However, the following statement based on
 the convexity of balls on which the local configurations are defined is true: for
 all configuration a e {?, +}8B, a ^ cr?, there exists a configuration crmin(a) g
 {-,+}8B satisfying
 k(cfmm(v)) = 1, V+(amin(a)) C V+(cr) and y(t]xcrmm(cr)) < y(x)xo).
 As a consequence, the maximum of Wn (x]xa) is obtained among the configurations
 a g {?, +}8B having only one positive vertex; k(a) = 1 and y (a) = V. For such
 a configuration a,
 " * = exp(2a(rc) - 2b(n)(y(xjxcr) - y(x])))
 Wnvn)
 = exp(2a(n) - 2b(n)(V - 2conn(xjx,a)))
 >exp(2a(n)-2b(n)V).
 The lower bound of (13) follows. The upper bound is also a consequence of the
 convexity of the ball B: the perimeter y (x]xa), a ^ a0, is necessarily as large as
 y(^x^0)- In other words, the difference y (x]xa) ? y(x]) is positive.
 Finally, we have already seen that the weight of a configuration x]f e Gr, dif
 ferent from x]?, is bounded by exp(2a(n) ? 2b(n)V). So, it is bounded by An(r?).
 D
 For example, the probability gap of a clean local configur
 lower bound given by (13), that is, txp(2a(n) ? 2b(n)V). Inde

 Lemma 2.4 is the main result of this section. It provides lower and upper bounds
 for the conditional probability ?a,b(Ix = 1W) depending on the weight Wn (x]) and
 the probability gap An(x]):

 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1, the probability gap An(r?) tends to 0
 and the probability of the indicator lff=(To tends to 1. Henceforth, relations (14)
 and (15) mean the weight Wn(j]) constitutes a good estimate for the probability
 ?a,bUx = 1).
 Before proving Lemma 2.4, let us explain why the results of this section do
 not hold when the pair potential is negative. If b(n) < 0, the condition a(n) ?
 b (n ) V < 0 (which ensures that the weight of a local configuration is smaller than 1 )
 implies the weight Wn(r?) and the probability gap A?(r?) are both bounded by
 exp(2a(n) ? 2b(n)V). In particular, we lose the inequality Wn(rf) < A?(r?) of
 Lemma 2.3 and therefore the lower bound of Lemma 2.4.
 Proof of Lemma 2.4. Let r) e Qr and x e Vn. Let a be a configuration of
 {-, +}SB- If a = a0, then Lemma 2.2 implies that

 The upper bound (15) is deduced from the above inequalities. The lower bound is
 also based on Lemma 2.2. Indeed,

 3. Poisson approximation. This section is devoted to the main resu
 paper, that is, Theorem 3.1. Let us introduce two hypotheses (HI) and (H
 will be sufficient to prove Theorem 3.1.
 For any given local configuration r\, let us define the subset Gr(x]) of G
 Gr(r1) = {r1feGr,V+(x]')DV+(x1)}.
 Each element of G*(xj) = Gr(r?) \ [x]} has at least k(x]) + 1 positive verti
 we denote by ?n(^l) and we call the maximality probability the following 
 n i ? *W)
 Gn(r])= max .
 ri' e*(ri) Wn(rj)
 The necessary condition ndWn(x?) = X, for some constant ? > 0, forces the w
 Wn(xj) to tend to 0 and therefore the local configuration xj to be different from xf.
 Thus, using the inequality y(r?) < Vk(x?), we deduce that the probabilistic cost
 associated to a single positive vertex, that is,
 exp(2a(n)-2b(n)V),
 is bounded by Wn(x])l^k^ and tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. Actually, The
 orem 3.1 requires stronger hypotheses. First, if the vertices corresponding to
 x + V+(x)) are positive, then the other ones belonging to B(x, r) and those be
 longing to the neighborhood 8B(x,r) must be negative. This fact results in
 (Hl): lim max{An(r?), ??(*/)} = 0.
 rc->+oc
 For V C Vn and ? e {?, +}v, the indicator function I y is defined as follows:
 I y (a) is 1 if the restriction of the configuration a e Xn to V is ? and 0 otherwise.
 Theorem 3.1 needs a control of the probability of the event Iy = 1. Let (H2) be
 the following hypothesis:
 (m). VV C Vn, 3N(V) eN,3C = C(\V\) > 0, Vf g {-, +}v,

 Here, C = C(\ V\) means that C depends on the set V only through its cardinality.
 Before introducing our main result, let us recall some classical notations. If
 ?i and v are two probability distributions, the total variation distance between
 ?i and v is

 where the supremum is taken over all measurable sets. The probability distribu
 tion of a random variable X is denoted by X(X) and that of Poisson distribution
 with parameter k by ?P(k). Moreover, if f(n) and g(n) are two positive functions,
 notation f(n) = 0(g(n)) means that there exists a constant C > 0 such that, for
 <dln,f(n)<Cg(n).
 Theorem 3.1 states that the asymptotic behavior of Xn(rj) is Poissonian and
 defines the speed of convergence in terms of total variation distance.
 THEOREM 3.1. Let rj be a local configuration of radius r. Assume that the
 magnetic field a(n) is negative, the pair potential b(n) is nonnegative and they
 satisfy
 ndWn(r1) = k,
 for some constant k > 0. Furthermore, if the hypotheses (HI) and (H2) are sat
 isfied, then the total variation distance between the distribution ofXn(rj) and the
 Poisson distribution with parameter k is such that:
 dTV(X(Xn(r])), P(k)) = 0(max{A?(r?), 0?(r?)}).
 Now, some comments are needed. First, this result generalizes the Poisson ap
 proximation given in [6] (Theorem 1.3). When the pair potential b(n) = b > 0 is
 fixed, the product nd exp(2a(n)k(r])) becomes constant. Denote by kf this quan
 tity. Then, the limit distribution for Xn(r]) is the Poisson distribution with para
 meter k = ?'exp(?2b(n)y(r])). Furthermore, the probability gap An(r]) and the
 maximality probability ?n(^l) are of order exp(2a(n)) and consequently,
 dTvU(Xn(r])), P(kfexp(-2b(n)y(r))))) = 0(n-d?k^).
 We believe that max{An(r?), ?n(r])} is the real speed at which the total variation
 distance between X(Xn(r])) and ?P(k) tends to zero. Indeed, it seems to be true
 for the upper bound given by Lemma 4.5 (for more details, see Chapter 3 of [2]).
 Moreover, this has been proved by Ganesh et al. [15] in the case where the local
 configuration r? represents a single positive vertex [with k(rj) = 1, y(r?) = V] and
 the pair potential is fixed.
 Under the hypotheses (HI) and (H2), the expectation of Xn(r]) satisfies
 ndWn(r)){\ - &(An(ri))) < Ea,b[Xn(ri)] < ndWn(r]){l + 0(A?(ij)))
 [see relations (20) and (21) of the next section]. In particular, if the product
 ndWn(r]) tends to 0 (resp. +oo), the same is true for Ea?[Xn(r))]. Actually, a bet
 ter result can be easily deduced from Theorem 3.1 : if the product nd Wn (rj) tends to
 0 (resp. +oc), then the probability /JLa,b(xn(^) > 0) tends to 0 (resp. 1). Roughly
 speaking, if Wn(rj) is small compared to n~~d, then asymptotically, there is no
 occurrence of r? in Gn. If Wn(r]) is large compared to n~d, then at least one oc
 currence of x] can be found in the graph, with probability tending to 1. Using the

 vocabulary of the random graph theory, this means that the quantity n~d is the
 threshold function for Wn(xj) of the property Xn(x]) > 0. A straight proof of this
 statement can be found in [8]. A result similar to (actually weaker than) Theo
 rem 3.1 can be proved without using the Stein-Chen method. Under the same
 hypotheses, the distribution of Xn(x]) converges weakly to P(X), as n tends to in
 finity. The proof of this result is based on the moment method (see [3], page 25)
 and Lemma 2.4; see the ideas developed in the proof of Lemma 4.6 for details.
 Replacing Proposition 4.4 with the Stein-Chen formulation of [1], it seems the
 estimates given by Lemma 2.4 should apply to systems formed by "animals" in
 teracting only by volume exclusions (as in [12] and [13]).
 Finally, as has been suggested by an anonymous referee, Theorem 3.1 can be
 extended to some nonlocal configurations whose cardinalities diverge suitably with
 the size of the lattice.
 The rest of this section is devoted to translating the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1
 in terms of magnetic field a(n) and pair potential b(n).
 PROPOSITION 3.2. Let x] be a local configuration of radius r. Assume that
 the magnetic field a (n) is negative, the pair potential b(n) is nonnegative and they
 satisfy
 ndWn(x]) = X,
 for some constant X > 0. Then the two conditions a(n) + 2Vb(n) < 0,for n large
 enough, and
 lim a(n) + Vb(n) = ? oo
 imply respectively the two hypotheses (H2) and (HI).
 The limit a(n) + Vb(n) -> ? oo forces the magnetic field a(n) to tend to ?oo.
 Proposition 3.2 and Theorem 3.1 state that a(n) -^ ?oo is the main condition
 bearing on the magnetic field a(n) in order to expect a Poisson approximation.
 Rare positive vertices among a majority of negative ones constitutes the global
 context in which our Poisson approximations take place. Conditions bearing on the
 pair potential b(n) are much larger. Here are two examples of couples (a(n),b(n))
 satisfying the conditions of Proposition 3.2 and so the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1.
 EXAMPLE 3.3. Assume the potentials a(n) < 0 and b(n) > 0 are such that
 ndWn(xj) = X, for some X > 0, and
 lim a(n) = ?oo and lim -= 0.
 rt-*+oo /i-?+oo a(n)
 Then, conditions of Proposition 3.2 are satisfied. Indeed, the quantity
 a(n) + Vb(n) = a(n)(\ + V~)

 tends to ?oo, so does a(n) + 2Vb(n). The pair potential b(n) is allowed to tend
 to +00 [but slower than \a(n)\] or to be bounded.
 Example 3.4. Assume the potentials a(n) and b(n) satisfy
 1
 a(n) =
 b(n) =
 2k(r1) + y(r1)/V
 a(n) ?1 *&)
 *(?)
 2V 4Vk(rj) + 2y(ri)
 where ? is a positive constant. The rate at which the pair potential b(n) tends
 to infinity is the same as \a(n)\. It is easy to check that the magnetic field a(n)
 is negative, b(n) is nonnegative, the product ndWn(r]) is equal to k, the quantity
 a(n) + 2Vb(n) is null and a(n) + Vb(n) ? a(n)/2 tends to ?oo. In other words,
 conditions of Proposition 3.2 are satisfied.
 Let us end this section by proving Proposition 3.2.
 Proof of Proposition 3.2. Let rj be a local configuration of radius r. As
 sume that potentials a(n) and b(n) satisfy conditions of Proposition 3.2.
 First, let us prove (HI) is satisfied. The study of the probability gap has been
 already done; An(r)) < zxp(2a(n)). Hence, the limit a(n) + Vb(n) -> ?oo forces
 the magnetic field a(n) to tend to ?oo and An(r]) to 0. Now, let us bound the
 maximality probability &n(rj). Let r]' e C*(r?). Although the set of positive vertices
 of rjf contains that of r?, the perimeter y(r\f) is not necessarily larger than y(r\)\
 roughly, V+(r?) may have holes. However, the inequality
 y(rjf)>y(r1)-(k(r]/)-k(r1))V
 holds. Hence, the ratio Wn(r?f) divided by Wn(t]) is bounded:
 W (nf)
 -P^- = cxp(2a(n){k(r1r) - k(r?)) - 2b(n)(ytf) - y(r?)))
 < exp((2a(n) + 2Vb(n))(k(r)') - k(r?))).
 Then the limit a(n) + Vb(n) -> ?oo implies the maximality gap satisfies
 W?W)
 ??(/?)= max
 n' C*(n) W?(t])
 <exp(2a(n) + 2Vb(n))
 and tends to 0 as n tends to infinity.
 It remains to prove that (H2) holds. Let V be a set of vertices and let ? be a
 configuration of {?, +}v. Let us start with writing
 Ha,bVv = J) = E ^.*(;v = !sv = D

 Let a and co be two configurations respectively defined on SV and SV. Thanks to
 Lemma 2.2 and relation (12), we get
 ta ,> Wn(taoj)
 ^ Wn(?cr )
 - Wn(co)
 < Wn(?a)exp(4b(n) rm(?a, co))
 < Wn(?cr)exp(4b(n)corm(cr, co)).
 Moreover, the weight of the configuration fa can be expressed as
 Wn?cr) = Wn(?)txp(2a(n)k(o) - 2b(n){y(?a) - y(f )))
 = Wn(?) txp(2a(n)k(a) - 2b(n){y(a) - 2conn(f, a))).
 Combining the previous relations, we deduce the following inequality:
 < Wn(?) txp(2a(n)k(a) - 2b(n)(y(o) - 2conn(f, a) - 2conn(a, co))).
 A way to obtain an upper bound for the above conditional probability which does
 not depend on co consists in using the inequality
 conn(f, or) + conn(a, co) < Vk(a).
 As a consequence,
 ?aM'y = lKv = l)^ Wn(f )exp((2a(n) +AVb(n))k(a) - 2b(n)y(a))
 <Wn(?),
 whenever a(n) + 2Vb(n) is negative. Then, the probability ?xa,b(Iy = 1) is
 bounded by the weight Wn(?) and finally we get
 At^(4 = l)<2|?V|Wn(f).
 Observe that the constant C(V) = 2V|V| > 2I<5V| is suitable and depends on the
 set V only through its cardinality. D

 whose layout is essentially the same as the one of the proof of Theorem 1.3 of

 Throughout this section, we shall suppose the magnetic field a(n) is negative, the
 pair potential b(n) is nonnegative and they satisfy

 for some constant k > 0.
 For all vertex x, the indicator random variable 1^ is defined by
 n= e //.
 ?7'eCr(77)
 where Gr(t]) is formed by the local configurations of radius r whose set of positive
 vertices contains that of r\. Thus, we denote by Xn(r\) the sum of these indicators
 over x eVn:
 x?(i?)=?72
 xeVn
 (16)
 = Xn(r1)+ Y, Xn(v),
 whose expectation Ea?[Xn(r])] will be simply denoted by kn. Finally, in order to
 simplify formulas, the maximum of the probability gap An(r]) and the maximality
 probability ?^(r?) will be merely denoted by Mn(rj):
 Mn(rj) = max{A?(r?), ?ufa)}.
 The proof of Theorem 3.1 is organized as follows. The total variation distance
 between X(Xn(rj)) and ?P(k) is bounded by
 dTW(X(Xn(r])), ?(Xnm) + dTw(X(Xn(r1)), P(kn)) + dlw(P(kn), ?P(k)).
 We are going to prove that each term of the above sum is of order 0(Mn(rj)).
 The first and the last ones are respectively dealt with using Lemmas 4.1 and 4.3.
 Applied to the family of indicators {1^, x e Vn], the Stein-Chen method gives an
 upper bound for the second term (Lemma 4.5). Finally, Lemma 4.6 implies that
 this upper bound is a 0(Mn(r])).
 As the maximality probability ?n(r)) tends to 0, the occurrences of local con
 figurations of C*(rj) = Cr(rj) \ [r]} have vanishing probability. Hence, the random
 variables Xn(r]) and Xn(rj) (resp. their expectations E[Xn(rj)] and kn) will be as
 ymptotically equal.
 LEMMA 4.1. The total variation distance between the distributions ofXn(r\)
 and Xn(rj) satisfies
 (17) dTw(X(Xn(r1)), ?(Xn(rj))) = &(Mn(rj)).
 Furthermore, the following inequalities hold:
 (18) Eatb[Xn(ri)] <kn< Ea,b[Xn(ri)] + \e*(rj)\kC(B)&n(r1),
 where C(B) denotes the constant of the hypothesis (H2) corresponding to a ball
 of radius r.

 Proof. The total variation distance between two probability distributions p
 and v can be written as
 dTW(?, v) = inf{P(X # Y), X(X) = p and X(Y) = v}.
 Using this characterization and the identity (16), it follows that
 dTY(X(Xn(xj)), X(Xn(x1))) < ^b{Xn(x])^Xn(x]))
 <?a,b{Xn(r])>Xn(xi))
 <?aJ ? Xn(ri')>0\.

 The above sum is an integer-valued variable. So, its p

 dTy(X(Xn(x])),X(Xn(x])))< ? Ea9b[X

 Let x]f g G*(xj). The hypothesis (H2) allows to control the expectation of xjf with

 Wn(xj')

 Wn(xj)
 <XC(B)&n(x]).
 Finally, we get
 dTY(X(Xn(x))), X(Xn(x]))) < \G;(x])\XC(B)@n(x])
 and (17) follows. Relation (18) is an immediate consequence of the previous in
 equalities and the identity (16). D
 Lemmas 2.4 and 4.1 state that the expectation of Xn(x]), that is, Xn, is close to
 that of Xn (xj), which is itself close to X.
 LEMMA 4.2. There exists a constant K(r) > 0 such that
 (19) ?(l - K(r)Mn(x1)) <Xn< X(l + K(r)Mn(xj)).
 The constant K(r) depends on the radius r and on the parameters of the model
 (i.e., p, p and the dimension d).

 Proof of Lemma 4.2. Let x eVn and denote by B the ball B(x, r). First,
 note that the indicator la^ao occurring in Lemma 2.4 can be expressed as the
 following sum:
 E %B>
 where a0 represents the null configuration of {?, +}SB. So, the upper bound (15)
 implies
 ?a,b[Xn(ri)] = Ea,b[ndiia,b(I? = l\F(8B))]
 - V ?to Wnia) )
 Let C(8B) be the constant of the hypothesis (H2) corresponding to the neighbor
 hood of a ball of radius r. Then,
 Ea,b[I?B]<C(8B)Wn(a).
 Hence, we obtain an upper bound for Ea?[Xn(r))]:
 (20) Ea,b[Xn(ri)] < k(l + An(r])28BC(8B)).
 Let us deal with the lower bound. It has been already said (Lemma 2.3) that the
 weight of a configuration a different from cr0 is smaller than the probability gap
 An(rj). As a consequence,
 Ea,b E'?B  < J2 C(8B)Wn(a)
 <2SBC(8B)An(r1).
 Next, we deduce from the lower bound (14):
 Ea,b[Xn(ri)]=KAnd?a,b(lx = M^i ))]
 >X(l-\er\An(r,))[l-Eaib
 (21)
 E'?B
 > ?(l - |er| An(/?))(1 - 2SBC(8B)An(r,))
 >X{1-An(r,)(\er\+2SBC(8B))).
 Finally, combining the inequalities between the expectation of Xn(rj) and kn given
 by relation (18) and the inequalities between the expectation of Xn(t]) and X given
 by (20) and (21), we conclude with
 K(r) = max{|e,| + 2SBC(8B), \C*(t])\C(B) + 2SBC(8B)}. D

 The total variation distance between two probability distributions on the set of
 integers can be expressed as
 dj\(?, v) = \ Y^ \?( ) - v(m)\.

 Using this characterization, relation (19) between Xn and X and hypothesis (HI),
 it is possible to bound the total variation distance between ?P(Xn) and P(X).
 This result is very similar to Lemma 4.2 of [6]. So, it will not be proved

 There remains to bound the total variation distance between X(Xn(r?)) and

 tors /^, x e Vn, are positively related. Replacing /,- with Ix, Z with Xn(r?) and 6

 The last term of the above bound is equal to the ratio k\ divided by n
 xeV?
 So, it tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. Hence, the bound (23) indicates that, as
 n -> +oo, the distance to the Poisson approximation is essentially the difference
 between the variance and the expectation of Xn(r]). This difference can be written
 as A?2(Xn(r])) + k? where M2(Xn(r?)) denotes the second moment of the random
 variable Xn(r}):
 M2(Xn(r])) = Ea,b[Xn(r1)(Xn(ri) - 1)].
 The quantity k% is controlled by Lemma 4.2, and the second moment Xn(rj) by the
 following result.
 LEMMA 4.6. The second moment of the random variable Xn(rj) satisfies
 M2(Xn(r1)) = k2 + &(Mn(ri)).
 We deduce from Lemma 4.5 that
 dTV(X(Xn(r1)),P(kn)) < ^(M2(Xn(r))) + kl(^ - l)).
 Thus, combining inequalities given by Lemmas 4.2 and 4.6, it follows that
 dTW(X(Xn(r])), 3>{kn)) = 0(Mn(ri) + n~d).
 We conclude using kn~d = Wn(rj) < An(rj) < Mn(r?).

 of this distinction will be revealed later. However, we can already remark that the
 number of couples (jci , X2) such that dist(xi, X2) < 2r + 3 is bounded by ?(2r +

 As for the number of couples (x\, X2) such that dist(xi, X2) > 2r + 3, it is merely
 bounded by n2d.
 Each indicator l\ is defined as the sum of Ix , x]' e Gr(x]). So, the second mo
 ment A?2(Xn(x])) can be expressed as
 E (Ea,b
 eer(ri)
 E
 (JTl,JC2)eV2
 distal ,jr2)<2r+3
 ill v Jl2
 lx\ x lx2  + Ea,
 E
 L (xux2)eV?
 dist(jci,^2)>2r+3
 *Xl X LX2
 where the above expectations will be respectively denoted by E-(xj\,xj2) and
 E>(x]\, x]2). We are going to prove the three following statements from which
 Lemma 4.6 follows:
 (24)
 (25)
 V(i?i,i?2) er(i;r
 (26) von,i?2) er(fi)2\{(ij,ij)}
 E-(x1ur]2) = (9(Mn(x])y,
 E>(x],x]) = X2 + 0(Mn(x1)y,
 E>(xiur)2) = &(Mn(r1)).
 Let (x\,X2) be a couple of vertices such that dist(jci, X2) < 2r + 3 and let xj\,
 x]2 be two local configurations of Gr(x]). The balls B(x\, r) and B(x2, r) are both
 included in the large ball B(x\, 3r + 3). The intuition is that if x]\ and x]2 occur on
 B(x\, r) and B(x2, r), then locally [i.e., in the ball B(x\, 3r + 3)] at least k(x]) + 1
 positive vertices are present. This has a vanishing probability. So as to lighten
 formulas, let us denote by B the ball B(x\, r) and by R the set of vertices y such
 that r < dist(jti, y) < 3r + 3. The event /?/ = 1% = 1 implies

 Let us consider r? e G*{r?) and a {?, +}R. Relation (27) implies

 where C(R) is the constant of (H2)

 In conclusion, we obtain an explicit bound for E-(r)\, r]2):
 Es(m, m) < ?(2r + 3)k(\e*(r,)\2^(l + C(R))&n(rj) + 2^C(R)An(r1)),
 from which relation (24) follows.
 Let (x\,x2) be a couple of vertices such that dist(xi, x2) > 2r + 3 and let 771,
 772 be two local configurations of Gr(r]). Here, denote respectively by B\ and ?2
 the balls B(x\,r) and 5(jC2,r). Since the distance between x\ and x2 is larger
 than 2r + 3, no vertex of Z?i can be a neighbor of a vertex of B2 [actually,
 dist(xi,JC2) > 2r + 1 suffices]. The Gibbs measure /xa^ yields a Markov ran
 dom field with respect to neighborhoods defined in (1) (see, e.g., [17], Lemma 3,
 page 7). As a consequence,

 POISSON APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE ISING MODEL 1349
 In a first time, assume that r?\ = xj2 = r?. Let a be a configuration of Xn. Thanks
 to Lemma 2.4, we can write
 2
 <Wn(x1)2(l + An(x])(?^-- + 1 X
 Wn(asB}) Wn(cf8B2)/
 + An(T]) \wn(cr8Bl)Wn(a8B2)))'
 The reason for which the distance between vertices x\ and X2 is assumed larger
 than 2r + 3 is the following: no vertex of SB\ can be a neighbor of a vertex of 8B2.
 So, the product Wn(a8BlWn(asB2) is equal to the weight Wn(asBlu8B2)- Hence,
 the inequality An(xj) < 1 and relation (28) imply that the probability ?a,bUxi =
 1^ = 1) is bounded by
 Wn(xj)2 1 + An(x]) V ( -?- + ?- + ?-?- )?a9b^)
 Y" ( l 1 1 \
 \ alXrS^^88^ Wn(?8B2) Wn(a8BlU8B2) J "' /
 Let C(8B) and C(28B) be the constants of (H2) respectively associated to the sets
 8B\ (or 8B2) and 8B\ U 8B2. Then, a new upper bound for the quantity ixa^Ux\ ?
 I^2 = \) is obtained:
 ^(^)2(l + An(^)(2|ojBllC(a?) + 2|aj?2lC(5?) + 2|aj?ll+|aj?2lC(2a?))).
 Finally, the term E>(x?,x]) satisfies the inequality
 E>(x],x]) < n2dWn(x1)2(l + 0(An(x])))
 and (25) is proved.
 Assume at least one of the two local configurations x]\,r\2^ Gr(xj) is different
 from xj. It remains to prove that E>(x]\,r?2) is of order Mn(x?). Techniques used in
 the previous case allow us to write
 2
 i=\
 Since this upper bound does not depend on the configuration on 8B\ U 8B2, we
 deduce from (28):
 fiatbV2} = 'i? = D = 0(W?(l?l)Wn(f/2)).
 Now, if the local configuration rn, for / = 1,2, is different from x], then its
 weight Wn(x]i) is smaller than Wn(t])@n(r]). So, ?n(x]) < 1 for n large enough
 and (r?\,x]2) ^ (r],x]) imply that the product Wn(x]\)Wn(x]2) is bounded by
 Wn(x))2?n(x]) and consequently (26) is proved. D
