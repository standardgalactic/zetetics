Abstract
Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a novel challenging task that lies between linguistic sense
disambiguation and fine-grained multimodal retrieval. The recent advancements in the development of
visiolinguistic (VL) transformers suggest some off-the-self implementations with encouraging results,
which however we argue that can be further improved. To this end, we propose some knowledge-
enhancement techniques towards improving the retrieval performance of VL transformers via the
usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as Knowledge Bases. More specifically, knowledge stored in
LLMs is retrieved with the help of appropriate prompts in a zero-shot manner, achieving performance
advancements. Moreover, we convert VWSD to a purely textual question-answering (QA) problem by
considering generated image captions as multiple-choice candidate answers. Zero-shot and few-shot
prompting strategies are leveraged to explore the potential of such a transformation, while Chain-of-
Thought (CoT) prompting in the zero-shot setting is able to reveal the internal reasoning steps an LLM
follows to select the appropriate candidate. In total, our presented approach is the first one to analyze
the merits of exploiting knowledge stored in LLMs in different ways to solve WVSD.

1. Introduction
Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a newly introduced task, where the most appro-
priate candidate image has to be retrieved given an ambiguous target word within a specific
context [1]. For example, given the ambiguous target word "andromeda" within the context
"tree", the phrase "andromeda tree" is formulated. The word "andromeda" itself may have
different meanings, referring to a constellation, flower, reptile or fish, and this ambiguity is
mitigated via the given context "tree". However, the presence of other tree-related candidate
images complicates the choice of the golden "andromeda tree" image.
VWSD can be viewed as a multimodal extension of textual word sense disambiguation,
which has received some considerable attention in recent years [2]. Resolving polysemy has
been approached in several ways, with one of the most prominent being knowledge-based

disambiguation. According to it, knowledge graphs representing linguistic relationships such
as WordNet [3] for English and BabelNet [4] for multilingual disambiguation are exploited to
frame the meaning of an ambiguous word based on its context, alleviating the need for training
during the disambiguation process. More specifically, both WordNet and BabelNet knowledge
graphs utilize synsets, i.e. sets of synonyms which express different meanings within different
contexts; hence, this structure is inherently related to the problem of sense disambiguation,
since several possible meanings are already explicitly encoded within each knowledge graph.
Nevertheless, given the ever-increasing amounts of linguistic information that need to be
stored in a knowledge base, structures such as WordNet and BabelNet naturally face scalability
limitations: novel words, contexts or languages demand high-quality manual engineering of
the related knowledge graphs to accommodate tasks such as word sense disambiguation in
a viable way. For example, given the example phrase "andromeda tree", a knowledge base
lacking the target word "andromeda" or the context "tree" (with respect to "andromeda") would
inevitably lead to disambiguation failure. To this end, the introduction of the Language Models
as Knowledge Bases (LM-as-KB) paradigm [5] opened a whole new world of possibilities for
knowledge representation. The expressive power of language models allows the extraction of
rich relational knowledge, similar to knowledge obtained when querying a structured knowledge
graph. Despite recent research advancements, the real-world utilization of the LM-as-KB
paradigm is still in its infancy, with several challenges and limitations arising [6]. These
challenges interrogate the adoption of the LM-as-KB framework in the visiolinguistic (VL)
setting [7], even though it is already favored in some tasks, such as Visual Question Answering
[8, 9, 10], Visual Commonsense Reasoning [11, 12] and Image Captioning [13].
In this work, we aim to explore the potential of following the LM-as-KB paradigm towards
resolving VWSD challenges. Specifically, we focus our contributions on two main directions:
• Ambiguous phrases are enriched with knowledge stored in Large Language Models (LLMs)
in a zero-shot fashion to provide more context for multimodal retrieval.
• We explore the conversion of VWSD to textual question-answering (QA) upon which we
apply zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies. We further investigate the usage of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to obtain explanations for LLM-based decisions.
2. Related work
Language models as Knowledge Bases
is a novel paradigm that harnesses the implicit
knowledge stored in neural weights of Language Models (LMs) similar to how explicit knowl-
edge of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has served related applications [5, 6]. Recent works probe
characteristics of different LLM-stored knowledge senses, such as commonsense [14], factual
[15] and temporal [16]. Model scale has revealed unprecedented LM capabilities related to
knowledge, such as different types of reasoning; there are open research questions related to
arithmetic [17], symbolic [18], commonsense [19] and causal reasoning [20] in large LMs, and
whether such models merely overfit large amounts of data or are genuinely capable of reasoning
similar to humans [21]. More recently, the LM-as-KB paradigm has been favored by the VL
community to enhance popular VL tasks [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], as in the case of the current paper.

Prompting Language Models
Traditionally, LMs are pre-trained on large amounts of text
corpora and then fine-tuned on smaller labelled ones to address longstanding challenges in NLP.
Scaling-up to several billion parameters (Large Language Models - LLMs) enables emergent
model capabilities, which can be communicated via prompting [22]. Different prompting
strategies have been proposed, such as zero-shot prompting, where the task is explicitly described
in natural language, and few-shot prompting, where few exemplars are provided to the LM
to guide answer generation [23]. More specifically, in-context learning (ICL) is a novel few-
shot paradigm where few sample demonstrations from the dataset are used to retrieve related
knowledge stored in the LLM without updating any parameters [24]. This technique is inspired
from the way humans learn from analogy [25] and has been successfully applied ever since
to serve several NLP tasks [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Another human-inspired prompting technique
is Chain-of-Thought (CoT), where the LM is encouraged by the prompt phrasing to generate
rationales together with the predicted answer [31, 32, 33]. Apart from the aforementioned
discrete prompt strategies, soft prompting sacrifices human-interpretable templates to achieve
more advanced knowledge retrieval [34]. In total, prompting can be viewed to be analogous to
querying knowledge graphs in the traditional knowledge retrieval scenario.
3. Method
The retrieval backbones utilized in all cases are pre-trained VL transformers, which place
both images 𝑖and textual phrases 𝑡in a joint embedding space. The retrieval of the most
appropriate image 𝑖with respect to a given text phrase 𝑡is performed based on a similarity
score score(𝑡, 𝑖) = max(sim(𝑡, 𝑖)), which can be obtained using different similarity measures,
such as cosine similarity or euclidean/manhattan distance1. In the baseline case, no knowledge
enhancement is performed, thus image candidates 𝑖and original phrases 𝑡are passed in the
VL transformer of choice. The VL transformers used are CLIP-L (CLIP [35] with ViT [36]
large encoder), CLIP𝐿𝐴𝐼𝑂𝑁(LAION/CLIP ViT-H/14)[37] trained on LAION-2B English subset
of LAION-5B, ALIGN [38], and BLIP [39] variants; specifically for BLIP, BLIP𝐶and BLIP-L𝐶
refer to variants pre-trained on COCO [40] and using ViT base/ViT large as backbone encoders
respectively, while BLIP𝐹and BLIP-L𝐹variants are pre-trained on Flickr30k [41].
Moreover, based on the observations of Dadas [42], there are image candidates 𝑖that present
high similarity scores with multiple text phrases 𝑡, thus imposing a majority bias. To this end,
we adopt the penalty factor 𝑝(𝑖), as introduced in [42], to diminish the similarity scores for
such frequently similar candidates 𝑖, without affecting the similarity scores for the rest of the
candidates. In cases 𝑝(𝑖) is incorporated in VL retrieval, the similarity score is altered as:
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑡, 𝑖) = sim(𝑡, 𝑖) −𝑝(𝑖)
(1)
3.1. LLM-based phrase enhancement
Following the LM-as-KB paradigm, the original text phrases 𝑡are transformed to knowledge-
enhanced phrases 𝑡𝑒by harnessing the rich factual knowledge stored in state-of-the-art LLMs.
1We will be using the term similarity to refer to both cosine similarity and euclidean/manhattan distance.

Zero-shot enhancement is achieved via the usage of discrete prompts that follow specific
handcrafted templates, as presented in Tab. 1. Those templates are created based on human
conversational intuition, encouraging the retrieval of related facts to produce 𝑡𝑒.
Table 1
Prompt templates used for zero-shot LLM knowledge enhancement of textual phrases 𝑡.

meaning_of
“What is the meaning of <phrase>?”
Emerging capabilities of LLMs, such as multiple types of reasoning, are analogous to model
size [33, 43], demonstrating that models beyond a specific scale may contain more advanced
knowledge. We examine whether this statement also stands for knowledge enrichment by
experimenting with models up to 13B parameters, which correspond to the upper limit our
hardware can accommodate, as well as with orders of magnitude larger models (175B parameters)
accessible via public APIs (susceptible to pre-defined pricing schemes). More specifically, we
use GPT2-XL (1.5B parameters) [44], BLOOMZ-1.7B & 3B [45], OPT-2.7B & 6.7B [46], Galactica
6.7B [47], LLAMA-7B [48] and Vicuna 7B & 13B [49] in the lower-billion scale, as well as the
175B parameter models of GPT-3 [50] and GPT-3.5-turbo2.
As in the baseline case, we attempt to incorporate the penalty 𝑝(𝑖) in the VL retrieval stage,
forming the following knowledge-enhanced similarity score for images 𝑖and phrases 𝑡𝑒:
score(𝑡𝑒, 𝑖) = sim(𝑡𝑒, 𝑖) −𝑝(𝑖)
(2)
3.2. Prompting LLMs with question-answering prompts
We transform VWSD to a question-answering (QA) task by converting the textual phrases 𝑡to
questions 𝑄that follow handcrafted prompt templates, as presented in Tab. 2. Our experimenta-
tion includes both zero-shot and few-shot prompting. In both scenarios, the LLMs prompted are
the Vicuna-13B [49] and the 175B GPT-3.5-turbo. Since the LLMs to be prompted can currently
handle textual but not VL inputs, we need to transit to exclusively textual representations
for both images 𝑖and phrases 𝑡. Therefore, image captioning techniques are leveraged to
achieve this transformation, providing captions 𝑐𝑖for each image candidate 𝑖. We experiment
with greedy search, where only one caption 𝑐𝑖per 𝑖is returned, as well as with beam-search
multinomial sampling using 5 beams, which returns 𝑘=10 captions 𝑐𝑘
𝑖per image 𝑖. The models
selected for captioning are GiT-L [51] and BLIP-L [39], which are both based on ViT-large [36]
encoder, and ViT-GPT2 [52], which uses ViT-base as the encoder and GPT-2 [44] as the decoder.
Throughout this VWSD as QA conversion we aim to leverage different aspects of knowledge
stored in the selected LLMs by employing the expressiveness of the designed QA prompts,
which allow for advanced flexibility compared to the knowledge enhancement setting described
in Sec. 3.1.

Reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be unlocked via the so-called Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting [33, 32, 31], where the LLM is asked to output a series of intermediate reasoning
steps that logically lead to its answer. Even though CoT prompting has mostly been exploited
for multi-step reasoning tasks, it is also able to provide human-understandable explanations
regarding the choice of the most appropriate candidate 𝑖for each phrase 𝑡. To this end, the
first 5 templates and the prompting pipelines of Tab. 2 are adopted from Kojima et al. [31],
where a "reasoning" prompt ("Let’s think step by step"/think prompts of Tab. 2) retrieves the
reasoning path stored in the LLM, followed by an "answer" prompt ("Therefore, [...] the answer
is"/CoT prompt of Tab. 2) that returns the final answer in an appropriate format. The rest of the
templates ("choose" prompt names) are inspired from LangChain prompts [53], following an
instructive and descriptive template to encourage the selection of the correct image candidate.
3.2.1. Zero-shot prompting
In the zero-shot setting, we input a selected prompt from Tab. 2 to the LLM (Vicuna-13B/GPT-
3.5-turbo), which generates the answer A. The generated A can be one of the caption options

A-J or a statement that an answer cannot be defined; in any case, A is compared with the ground
truth caption to determine the success or failure of the zero-shot prompting strategy under
investigation. CoT prompts are accompanied with producing an explanation for choosing A.
3.2.2. Few-shot prompting
Additionally, we experiment with few-shot prompting in place of the previously described
zero-shot prompting. In this case, we select k no_CoT/choose no_CoT (greedy) prompts (Tab.
2), accompanied by their ground truth A, thus forming QA in-context samples. The number
of in-context samples k is defined by the user. We design three different ways of selecting
the k in-context samples. In the baseline case (random), the k samples are randomly selected
from the dataset. Nevertheless, since the relevance of selected samples with respect to a
chosen sample is significant [54], as well as the sample ordering [55], we design two similarity-
based sample selection methods, namely top and inverse-top. Both selection methods exploit
embedding representations of full phrases t, which are obtained using ALIGN [38]. The k
nearest embeddings to a given phrase embedding are efficiently retrieved with the help of cosine
similarity. Then, the top ordering strategy places the top-1 most similar QA sample first (which
corresponds to the most similar full phrase embedding), followed by the 2nd most similar QA
sample, until the k-th most similar in the k-th position. On the other hand, the inverse-top
strategy reverses this order by placing the top-1 most similar QA example in the k-th position.
4. Experiments
4.1. LLM-based phrase enhancement results
In Tab. 3 we present results regarding LLM-based phrase enhancement using different LLMs-as-
KB and the prompts of Tab. 1. More results are provided in Appendix A.
We can easily observe that LLM-based enhancement helps trespassing baseline accuracy and
MRR scores when appropriate prompting is used, irrespectively of the usage of VL penalty
𝑝(𝑖); "exact" prompt seems to be rather weak towards triggering the necessary knowledge to
further drive VL retrieval, as in several cases metrics corresponding to phrases enhanced using
the "exact" prompt fall below the baseline performance. On the other hand, "meaning_of" is
the more powerful prompt attempted, resulting in non-negligible performance advancements
compared to the baselines in most cases. Overall, the combination of GPT-3 phrase enrichment
together with CLIP𝐿𝐴𝐼𝑂𝑁(with penalty 𝑝(𝑖)) as the VL retrieval module lead to optimal results.
An interesting observation is that the Vicuna 7/13B models perform comparably to GPT-
3/3.5 models despite being orders of magnitude smaller. This is an encouraging result suggesting
that LLM-based phrase enrichment may be successfully performed with more lightweight LLMs
that do not adhere to a limiting pricing plan, which would impede large-scale experimentation.
However, in most cases that LLMs in the lower-billion scale are employed for knowledge
enhancement (Tab. 8), retrieval results struggle to compete with the knowledge-free baselines,
revealing a non-negligible association between scale and knowledge-enhancement capabilities.

4.2. Question-answering prompting results
In Tab. 4 we present accuracy scores occurring from transforming VWSD to QA using zero-shot
(with and without CoT) and few-shot (without CoT) prompting, denoting best results per prompt
with color. In general, there is an obvious discrepancy between the performance of GPT-3.5-
turbo and Vicuna-13B, denoting that model scale does matter in the VWSD as QA scenario,

contrary to the phrase enhancement case (Sec. 4.1): smaller models do not possess the necessary
knowledge or reasoning abilities to infer the correct answer from captions in the QA setting, no
matter the prompt template deployed or the choice between zero-shot/few-shot strategy. This
finding agrees with the observation of Kojima et al. [31] that LLM reasoning capabilities emerge
at scale. Moreover, there is no clear pattern whether beam or greedy captioning is more effective
towards triggering the necessary knowledge: in the case of GiT-L and BLIP-L there is a clear
preference towards greedy decoding in conjunction with CoT & no_CoT prompting. Especially
for Vicuna-13B this preference is very distinctive, demonstrating significant performance drops
when beam decoding is employed in place of greedy decoding. However, the opposite holds for
ViT-GPT2, even though the overall performance of ViT-GPT2 is lower in comparison to the
other captioners. The performance becomes even worse when beam decoding is employed with
few-shot prompting. At the same time, "choose" prompts do not demonstrate a distinct pattern
with respect to the decoding strategy (greedy/beam) as well. Overall, GiT-L (greedy) exhibits the
most promising captioning capabilities in the majority of Tab. 4 results, while BLIP-L (greedy)
appears more capable in the few-shot prompting setting of Vicuna-13B (colored cells).

4.2.1. Zero-shot prompting and CoT reasoning
According to Tab. 4, accuracy results with zero-shot QA prompting are not always encouraging,
especially when compared to LLM-based enrichment results of Tab. 3, which approach state-of-
the-art performance. Apart from the fact that proper LLM reasoning is still an open problem
[56, 57], one possible fundamental reason for these lower accuracy scores can be the conversion
from images to text via captioning: this intra-modality conversion may induce errors and
information loss that impacts the final performance. Of course, lower performance will also
affect the quality of the produced explanations, when CoT is employed. We delve into this

scenario by presenting an example where the usage of CoT leads to an erroneous answer,
while the no_CoT case succeeds. In Fig. 1 the candidates for the phrase "tender embrace" are
showcased. By employing GiT-L (greedy) as the image captioner, we form the question Q as:
Q: What is the most appropriate caption for the tender embrace? Answer Choices: (A) a small boat sitting on top of a
dock. (B) a group of people walking on a green hill. (C) a student gets a hug from a student. (D) a large fly laying on a
rock in the water. (E) the bus stop at the station (F) a train is parked at a station. (G) a crowd of people watching a
concert. (H) a train station with a sign on the side of it. (I) a black and red train on a track. (J) a man laying in the
sand on top of a surfboard.

In Tab. 5 the results of GPT-3.5-turbo with and without zero-shot CoT are demonstrated.
Table 5
Example of VWSD as QA with & w/o zero-shot CoT prompting. Questions Q are presented truncated.
GPT-3.5-turbo is the selected LLM, as it presented best results for CoT/no_CoT prompts of Tab. 4.

Q: What is the most appropriate [...]
A: The most appropriate caption for the tender embrace would be: (C) a student gets a hug from a student. ✔
CoT
Q: What is the most appropriate [...]
A: Let’s think step by step.
First, we need to understand what the tender embrace is referring to. Once we know that, we can look at
the answer choices and find the one that best matches the subject of the photo. Therefore, without further
information about the photo, it is not possible to choose the most appropriate caption. Could you please provide
more context or information about the photo?
Therefore, among A through J, the answer is not applicable without more information about the photo" X
After observing the captions 𝑐𝑖produced by GiT-L, we confirm that they accurately describe
the context, thus being appropriate answer options. Nevertheless, when prompted with CoT in
a zero-shot manner, GPT-3.5-turbo is unable to define where "tender embrace" refers to without
receiving more information. On the contrary, it successfully returns the right answer when no
CoT is used. This discrepancy reveals that even though the knowledge regarding the phrase
"tender embrace" exists within the LLM, zero-shot CoT prompting is unable to trigger it. This

can be viewed as an inherent problem of CoT prompting, at least in the zero-shot setting, since
the only factor that differs between successful and unsuccessful reasoning is the prompt itself.
On the other hand, zero-shot CoT prompting can provide valuable insights in several cases,
such as the one presented in Fig. 2 with candidates corresponding to the phrase "metal steel".
By again using GiT-L as the captioner, the question Q is formed as:
Q: What is the most appropriate caption for the metal steel? Answer Choices: (A) a chocolate bar with three sides (B)
[unused0] and [unused0] at the concert in 2007 (C) a guitar and a guitar are displayed in front of a speaker. (D) frosty
patterns on a window (E) gold in the rocks - - (F) a black piece of metal with a large black square in the middle. (G) a
jar of honey on a wooden table. (H) a close up of a metal plate with a pattern of lines. (I) a large white quartz rock
with a clear base. (J) gold jewelry from the late 19th century.

Then, GPT-3.5-turbo outputs the results presented in Tab. 6, successfully guided by CoT.

Q: What is the most appropriate [...]
A: The most appropriate caption for the metal steel would be (F) a black piece of metal with a large black square
in the middle. X
CoT
Q: What is the most appropriate [...]
A: Let’s think step by step.
First, we need to understand what metal steel is and what its characteristics are. Steel is a hard and strong metal
alloy made mainly of iron and carbon. It is often used in construction, machinery, and transportation. Based on
this information, the most appropriate caption for metal steel would be (H) a close up of a metal plate with a
pattern of lines. This caption describes the texture and appearance of steel, which is often characterized by its
distinctive pattern of lines. The other options do not accurately describe steel or its unique qualities.
Therefore, among A through J, the answer is (H) a close up of a metal plate with a pattern of lines." ✔
This analysis highlights that the current state of CoT reasoning cannot be entirely trusted, as the
deployment of CoT prompts themselves may drive the LLM towards incorrect reasoning paths.
Thus, CoT reasoning for VWSD is not yet mature enough to provide valuable explanations.
Furthermore, regarding the comparison between standalone CoT/no_CoT prompts and
"choose" CoT/no_CoT prompts, there is a clear performance advancement when "choose"

prompts are leveraged, reaching more than 10% performance gain in the case of BLIP-L (beam)
as captioner and GPT-3.5-turbo as the LLM to be prompted. We regard this as an evidence that
more descriptive and motivating prompts can better evoke the correct reasoning process of an
LLM. Finally, there is no clear indication of whether CoT facilitates performance over no_CoT
when combined with the "choose" prompting template, since best results per captioner and LLM
of Tab. 4 alternate between "choose" CoT/no_CoT strategies, and are often comparable.
4.2.2. Few-shot prompting
In the baseline few-shot setting (few-shot (random)), we randomly select k=5 instances to serve
as in-context examples. These in-context samples are comprised of k questions Q followed
by their ground truth answer choice, as described in Sec. 3.2.2. Results of Tab. 4 denote that
few-shot performance using no_CoT prompts is significantly better compared to their zero-shot
counterparts, while generally being on par with "choose" prompt results, even though the
derived accuracy is close to random choice or even worse in most cases. Therefore, despite the
advanced engineering few-shot prompting requires compared to the zero-shot setting, it can
be regarded as a more viable choice for retrieving internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. As
for the choice of in-context sample selection and order strategy, the results are not conclusive;
similarity-based sample selection (top & inv. top columns of Tab. 4) may result in better (GIT-
L greedy), worse (ViT-GPT2 beam) or comparable results to the random baseline accuracy.
Moreover, sample ordering (top versus inv. top) presents some variability in accuracy, with each
strategy performing better in different cases. Overall, we can state that few-shot prompting calls
for more extensive experimentation beyond the purpose of the current work until a standard
pattern emerges, while there is a possibility that no pattern can be inferred at all.
We are going to present some qualitative results regarding few-shot prompting. Fig. 3
contains candidates corresponding to the phrase "football goal", while GiT-L (greedy) serves as
the captioner. The k=5 in-context samples are demonstrated in Tab. 7 followed by the answer

5. Conclusion
In this work, we explore the conjunction of the Visual Word Sense Disambiguation task and
Large Language Models. More specifically, our current paper is the first one to harness the
rich knowledge stored in LLMs via different prompting strategies. Following the LLM-as-KB
paradigm we managed to boost the performance of baseline visiolinguistic pipelines. Moreover,
we examined the potential of unimodal approaches by converting VWSD to a textual question-
answer problem, where generated image captions are leveraged as multiple-choice candidates.
Finally, Chain-of-Thought prompting highlighted human-interpretable explainability aspects
tied to the LLM-based knowledge extraction process. Overall, our analysis reveals the importance
of model scale towards performing knowledge-related tasks with LLMs.

A. Scale significance for knowledge enhancement
As an extension of Tab. 3, we presents results regarding LLM-enhancements using other LLMs
(1.7B to 7B parameters) in Tab. 8.
Compared to Tab. 3, smaller models present more mediocre knowledge enhancement capabil-
ities, frequently scoring below the knowledge-free VL retrieval baseline. Such a result indicates
that knowledge enhancement is not a "free-lunch" solution to boost results, but requires tuning
several aspects of the process in order to benefit the downstream task. Therefore, despite the
encouraging performance of Vicuna7B/13B models, other LLMs in the lower-billion range do not
possess the necessary knowledge capabilities to effectively perform knowledge enhancement
for VWSD. Therefore, we can conclude that similarly to the QA prompting that demonstrated
the need for scale, also prompting for knowledge enhancement is strongly associated with
model size. To this end, we verify that smaller models with competitive capabilities, similar to
the Vicuna series, need to be develop in order to facilitate applications related -but not limited-
to LLM-based knowledge-enhancement.
B. Reproducibility
Our code can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/anastasiakrith/llm-for-vwsd/.
