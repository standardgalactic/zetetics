University Press, prove that, under certain conditions, coherence cannot in-
crease the probability of the target claim. These formal results, known as ‘the
impossibility theorems’ have been widely discussed in the literature. They are
taken to have signiﬁcant epistemic upshot. In particular, they are taken to show
that reports must ﬁrst individually conﬁrm the target claim before the coher-
ence of multiple reports offers any positive conﬁrmation. In this paper, I
dispute this epistemic interpretation. The impossibility theorems are consis-
tent with the idea that the coherence of independent reports provides a
powerful reason to believe that the reports are true even if the reports do not
individually conﬁrm prior to coherence. Once we see that the formal discov-
eries do not have this implication, we can recover a model of coherence
justiﬁcation consistent with Bayesianism and these results. This paper, thus,
seeks to turn the tide of the negative ﬁndings for coherence reasoning by
defending coherence as a unique source of conﬁrmation.

reasoning in the context of medical diagnosis. Sextus Empiricus gives the
following example of Carneades’s use of coherence reasoning:
Just as some doctors detect the genuine fever patient not from one symptom, such as an
excessive pulse or a severe high temperature, but from a cluster, such as a high temperature
as well as pulse and soreness to the touch and flushing and thirst and similar things, so too
the Academic makes his judgment as to the truth by a cluster of appearances.1
Alexius Meinong appeals to coherence and provides the following metaphor of
how coherence may function. “One may think of playing cards. No one of them is
capable of standing by itself, but several of them, leaned against other, can serve to
hold each other up.”2 Otto Neurath held that coherence plays a crucial role in
justifying scientiﬁc knowledge.3 Coherence reasoning is also commonplace. Peo-
ple often accept or reject a claim on the basis of its coherence or lack of coherence
with a body of information.4
The possibility that coherence can increase the justification of a claim has
come under attack from results in formal epistemology known as ‘impossibility
theorems’.5 These theorems aim to show (a) coherence cannot increase the prob-
ability of a claim and (b) more coherence doesn’t imply higher probability. The ﬁrst
claim focuses on the coherence of a single body of information and whether
coherence can increase probability, whereas the second claim focuses on two
bodies of information and whether the more coherent body of information is more
probable. My goal in this paper is to focus on the ﬁrst claim proved by Huemer
(1997), Olsson (2002, 2005), and Bovens and Hartmann (2003).6 For ease of dis-
cussion, I’ll focus initially on Huemer’s result.
The discussion over coherence as a source of confirmation begins with the idea
that the coherence of multiple reports should offer positive confirmation even if the
reports individually do not offer positive confirmation. The formal results then
show that a necessary condition for coherence to offer positive confirmation is that
the reports individually offer positive confirmation. This has been interpreted to
have epistemic upshot: coherence cannot increase rational credence unless rational
credence is ﬁrst moved by the individual reports alone. It is this upshot that I dispute.
All the theorem shows is that a necessary condition for coherence is that the reports

are individually relevant. The theorem does not show that one’s credence must ﬁrst
be moved by the individual reports in order for one’s credence to be moved by
coherence. One’s credence function could be such that, prior to learning that the
evidence is coherent, one’s credence is unmoved by individual reports but then,
posterior to learning the fact of that the individual reports cohere, one’s credence
function is moved by individual reports. The project of this paper is to argue for
this claim and to provide a model of coherence justiﬁcation consistent with
Bayesianism.
The paper is structured as follows. I begin with a discussion of the nature and
epistemic role of coherence which will put us in a position to see both (i) how
coherence is thought to function in epistemology and (ii) how the formal results
rely on questionable epistemic interpretations. I then move to explain the
impossibility theorem proved by Huemer and to highlight the epistemic in-
terpretations of result. Third, I offer an initial defense of the power of coherence.
Fourth, I consider Olsson’s attempt to more adequately model the effect of
coherence in terms of hypotheses about witness reliability. I then situate my
approach to coherence justification within Olsson’s witness reliability models.
Finally, I expand on the progress we made in the fourth section to provide a model
of coherence justification that is consistent with standard Bayesian approaches.
These models provide a clear way to demonstrate the possibility of coherence as a
source of confirmation.
1 The Nature & Role of Coherence
A longstanding complaint against friends of coherence is that the concept of
coherence is unclear. Coherence is often understood in terms of a body of infor-
mation that “fits” or “hangs together”. But what is this notion of “fit”? A.C. Ewing
in 1934 channeled a common complaint against the use of coherence reasoning
that apart from a clear account of coherence, the theory is “reduced …to be mere
uttering of a word, coherence, …rob[bing] it of almost all significance.”7
C.I. Lewis in his 1946 book An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation makes
headway on clarifying the notion of coherence by proposing what has been termed
the ‘witness agreement’ model of coherence.8 Lewis’s key observation is that
coherence is best seen in the case in which multiple witnesses report that the same
7 Ewing (1934, 246).
8 Lewis (1946). He also provides a formal deﬁnition of coherence. A discussion of his formal
deﬁnition is beyond the scope of this paper. See Roche (2013) for a discussion of Lewis’s deﬁnition
of coherence, among others.

event has occurred. In the case in which the witnesses are independent, Lewis
thinks that the agreement of the reports provides a powerful reason to accept the
report. Lewis explains,
Imagine a number of relatively unreliable witnesses who independently tell the same cir-
cumstantial story. For any one of these reports, taken singly, the extent to which it confirms
what is reported may be slight. And antecedently, the probability of what is reported may also
be small. But the congruence of the reports establishes a high probability of what they agree
upon.9
Lewis’s witness agreement model takes coherence to be agreement in content. Two
reports cohere with each other when they report the same event. Lewis holds that
agreement in content is epistemically powerful when (i) the reports are indepen-
dent and (ii) individually, the reports have some positive, but small, bearing on the
content of the claim. Under these conditions Lewis thinks that the coherence of the
reports can bestow a significant probability on the claim thus supported, even if
any single report has little effect.
Laurence BonJour appeals to Lewis’s witness argument model in his defense of
a coherentist account of empirical justification. BonJour aims to defend epistemic
coherentism on which coherence is the ultimate source of justification. He sees in
Lewis’s witness agreement scenario an illustration of the power of pure coherentist
reasoning. He writes,
What Lewis does not see, however, is that his own example shows quite convincingly that no
antecedent degree of warrant or credibility is required. For as long as we are confident that the
reports of the various witnesses are genuinely independent of each other, a high enough
degree of coherence among them will eventually dictate the hypothesis of truth telling as the
only available explanation of their agreement.10
BonJour posits that the positive bump in credence that any individual report
provides is not essential to the power of coherence. If the reports are independent
from one another then coherence alone provides a powerful reason to think the
content is true. BonJour’s thought is twofold: (i) rational belief may not be moved
by individual testimonial reports but even so (ii) rational belief may be moved by
the coherence of individual testimonies.
Whether or not BonJour is right is a crucial question for the viability of
epistemic coherentism. Can coherence increase the justification of a body of claims
without first requiring that those claims have some justification independent of
coherence? Michael Huemer’s (1997) paper attempts to answer this question by
9 Lewis (1946, 346).

interpreting BonJour’s intuition as formal constraints on a probabilistic model. Let
us turn to Huemer’s theorem and its interpretation.
2 Huemer’s Theorem
Michael Huemer’s (1997) paper illustrates a fruitful engagement between Bayesian
epistemology and traditional epistemology.11 Huemer interprets BonJour’s intui-
tion as formal constraints on a probabilistic model. He then proves that there are no
probabilistic models satisfying those constraints. This negative result is claimed to
show that BonJour’s intuition, thus formalized, is provably false. In this section I
explain this result and the conclusions that are drawn from it.
2.1 Setup
Let us begin with some terminology. Let Wi,A indicate that witness i reports A.
BonJour’s claim that the witness reports need no antecedent degree of warrant or
credibility may be understood thusly:12
No Cred : P(A|Wi, A) = P(A).
In contrast Lewis’s model assumes that the witness reports have, at least, some
small degree of credibility. That is,
Cred : P(A|Wi, A) > P(A)
In these claims, and throughout the paper, we should understand probability as
rational credence.13 (No Cred) speciﬁes that a single witness report does not move
one’s credence. The idea is that one lacks any relevant information about whether
the witnesses report truthfully, and so for any individual report one’s credence
does not change.
The next feature of BonJour’s intuition is that the witnesses are genuinely
independent of each other. If the witnesses are independent, then, BonJour thinks,
the coherence of their reports provides a powerful reason to believe that the reports
are true. We might attempt to capture witness independence in terms of stochastic
independence. This requires that the probability of one event does not influence
11 Huemer (1997).
12 There’s a tacit universal quantiﬁer ranging over witness i. This condition should be read “for
any witness i the prior probability of A is unmoved by i’s report that A.” The other conditions below
should be read similarly.
13 See Maher (2006, 2010).

87

the probability of another event. Events X and Y are stochastically independent if
and only if P(X|Y) = P(Y). This is represented as X ╨Y. Following this line,
BonJour’s idea that the witnesses are independent becomes,
Stochastic independence : Wi, A ╨Wj, A=dfP(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A) = P(Wj, A).
This interpretation of witness independence rules out the possibility that there can
be evidential relationships between witness reports. It may be that one’s credence
that a second witness will report A given that a first witness reports A is higher than
one’s prior credence that the second witness reports A. This would be the case if the
individual witnesses are responsive to the truth. If my son reports that there is a
leak in the bathroom then this rationally increases my credence that my daughter
will independently report the same thing. The interpretation of independence
should not foreclose this possibility.
A better way to capture BonJour’s intuition is that the individual witness
reports are conditionally independent. This is,
Conditional independence:
(1) P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A ∧A) = P(Wj, A|A)
(2) P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A ∧¬A) = P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒¬ A)
(1) Specifies that one’s credence that j will report A is responsive to A alone; another
witness testimony is screened off by A. (2) Speciﬁes the same thing with respect to
¬A. (1) and (2) are what we’d expect for witnesses who are causally independent of
each other.14 In the above case, my son’s and daughter’s reports about the leak are
conditionally independent in virtue of the fact that they both track the same state of
affairs.
BonJour’s intuition can then be understood as saying that under the condi-
tions of no individual credibility and conditional independence, the agreement
of multiple witness reports provides powerful evidence that the reports are true.
That is,
BonJour’s formal intuition: It is possible that P(A|Wi, A ∧Wj, A) > P(A) even
if (i) P(A|Wi, A) = P(A), (ii) P(A|Wj, A) = P(A), and (ii) the reports are conditionally
independent.
This is intended to capture the thought that the coherence of reports can
provide a reason to believe a claim even if the reports individually do not first
provide such a reason.
14 See Olsson (2002, 262) for a discussion on the reasons for conditional independence.

2.2 Huemer’s Theorem
The problem with BonJour’s intuition, thus formalized, is that it is a theorem of
probability that under these conditions, the agreement of multiple reports does not
change the relevant prior probability.
Huemer’s theorem: P(A|Wi, A ∧Wj, A) = P(A) when (i) P(A|Wi, A) = P(A), (ii)
P(A|Wj, A) = P(A), and the reports are conditionally independent.
Let us briefly track through the major moves in the proof of this theorem.15
We’ve seen above that conditional independence requires these conditions
1. P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A ∧A) = P(Wj, A|A)
2. P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A ∧¬A) = P(Wj, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒¬ A)
(No Cred) maintains
1. P(A|Wi, A) = P(A).
Lastly the idea that there is a coherence justification requires
1. P(A|Wi, A ∧Wj, A) > P(A).
Huemer’s theorem shows that (1) & (2) & (3) imply ¬(4).
While (No Cred) is crucial for this result, it has some surprising implications.
In effect, it speciﬁes that any single witness testimony that A is stochastically
independent from A, that is for all witnesses i Wi, A ╨A. The relationship between a
witness testimony and the testiﬁed fact is like the relationship between ﬂips of a
fair coin. So, (No Cred) implies that there is no evidential inﬂuence between A and
Wi, A. There is something funny about this because coherence is supposed to
provide evidence that the witnesses are indeed testifying to the truth. Recall that
(No Cred) is intended to capture the BonJour’s thought that individual claims prior
to coherence do not provide evidence; the evidence that the claims provide comes
from the coherence of the claims. To ﬁll this out, let us examine two implications.
First, (No Cred) implies that learning that A occurs does not change one’s
credence that witness i testiﬁes that A. That is, the following is true:16
( † ) P(A|Wi, A) = P(A) ⇔P(Wi, A|A) = P(Wi, A).
(†) is to be expected when one lacks any knowledge about whether witness i tracks
A. If one’s prior credence in A is unmoved by a report that A then one ought to think
that independently learning A doesn’t change one’s credence that i reports A.
Similarly, if learning that A doesn’t change one’s prior credence that i reports A
15 I follow Olsson’s terminology. See (Olsson 2017).
16 This is a well-known result but for the uninitiated see §6 in the appendix for a proof.
Coherence & Conﬁrmation
89

then learning that i reports A doesn’t change one’s credence that A. Thus, (†)
implies that i’s report that A is like background noise with respect to A.
Second, (No Cred) implies one’s credence that i reports A is the same condi-
tional A or ¬A. That is,17
( ‡ ) P(A
⃒⃒⃒⃒Wi, A) = P(A) ⇔P(Wi, A|A) = P(Wi, A
⃒⃒⃒⃒¬ A).
A natural way to understand (‡) is that individual witness reports are not
responsive at all to the relevant facts. Rather the relationship between the indi-
vidual reports and the relevant facts is the same as the relationship between
individual flips of a fair coin. Just as there is no evidential relationship between the
1st flip of a fair coin and the 2nd flip of a fair coin, there is no evidential relationship
between i’s report that A occurred and A’s occurrence. This is an important
consequence of (No Cred) which I return to below.
Given (†) and (‡), Huemer’s theorem is easily proved.18 The crucial question,
though, is how we should understand the result. I turn to this question in the next
section.
2.3 Interpreting Huemer’s Theorem
While the theorem is indisputable, its interpretation is not. The theorem is taken to
be bad news for coherentism. Huemer titles the section in which he proves the
theorem ‘Coherentism refuted.’19 After proving that the coherence of two testi-
monies doesn’t change the probability of the content of the testimony, Huemer
draws the following lesson:
We see that if X receives no conﬁrmation at all from either A or B individually, then X receives
no conﬁrmation at all from A and B together. If neither witness has any independent credi-
bility, then the correspondence of the two witnesses’ testimony provides no reason at all for
thinking that what they report is true.20
This result, he claims, is not surprising because “it is highly counterintuitive that
one can manufacture confirmation of a hypothesis merely by combining a suffi-
cient number of pieces of evidence that are, individually, completely irrelevant to
the hypothesis.”21
17 This too is a well-known result. See appendix §7 for a proof.
18 See Appendix §8.

Erik Olsson’s interpretation of this theorem coheres with Huemer’s. Olsson
explains,
BonJour’s central argument for his coherence theory is manifestly false. Contrary to what he
thinks, coherence cannot generate credibility from scratch when applied to independent
data. Some reports must have a degree of credibility that is prior to any consideration of
coherence, or such agreement will fail to have any effect whatsoever on the probability of
what is reported.22
Olsson takes the upshot of Huemer’s theorem to be that the BonJour’s central
coherentist intuition is provably false. As Olsson understands it, coherence gen-
erates credibility only if the individual claims already have some degree of
credibility.
In the rest of the paper I dispute Huemer’s and Olsson’s interpretation of the
consequences of this theorem. For the reasons I lay out in the next section the
theorem fails to undermine BonJour’s original intuition. The theorem specifies a
mathematical relationship between individual items of evidence, the mass of ev-
idence, and target claim required for a boost of credence from a mass of evidence,
viz., that such a boost requires that the individual items of evidence are relevant.
But that mathematical relationship doesn’t have the methodological lessons that
are drawn from it. At best, the theorem shows that a body of information cannot be
both individually evidentially irrelevant and yet evidentially relevant upon
reaching some critical mass. The theorem specifies a necessary condition for
coherence justification; but the necessary condition has no implications regarding
whether one’s credence must ﬁrst be moved by individual reports before being
moved by the coherence of the reports. All the theorem shows is that if coherence
conﬁrms then the individual reports conﬁrm. But that is a far cry from showing that
coherentism is false. It could be that upon learning that the mass of evidence is
coherent, the individual claims become evidentially relevant; but not otherwise. I
turn now to develop this idea.
3 The Power of Coherence
It’s time for a story. Several years ago, there was a curious incident in my house. My
son, about two years old at the time, had a bedroom between my room and the
kitchen. In the middle of the night if I was peckish, I’d tiptoe through his room
dodging various objects in the room in hopes not to disturb a sleeping toddler. One
night, as I stealthily crossed his room, I saw a curious shadow. It could be a number
22 Olsson (2005, 69).

91

of things, but, on second look, nothing was there and so I dismissed it. A day later
my son was playing in his room and came out to say ‘snake’ or something like that
in toddler speech. As best I could make out, he was being playful and so we played
with legos for a while. A few days later my daughter around six years old at the time
was playing with my son and says ‘Oh, it’s a snake’. Now, my kids make-believe
much and it often focuses on animals. It’s entirely common to hear make-believe
speech like ‘Oh, it’s a shark’ or ‘Oh, it’s a horse’. So, in an isolated context, my six-
year old’s speech act isn’t evidentially relevant. But, in this particular context,
when my daughter said that, the three events all clicked and I began to give some
credence the possibility that a snake was in the house. If you’ve ever tried to find a
snake in a house, it’s not easy. Snakes don’t make noise and they prefer dark places
that are hard to reach. But the coherence of these reports made salient the chance
that a snake was in the house that a search commenced. After removing all the
furniture from my son’s room, a snake was found. The story ends well for all. The
snake was returned to the woods, my son’s room was safe for a toddler again, and I
learned to take more seriously shadows in the night and playful toddler speech.
The story illuminates a key point about the role of coherence: coherence can
make information evidentially relevant to a hypothesis when it is otherwise eviden-
tially irrelevant. Let’s reﬂect on the epistemology of this curious incident. The ﬁrst
item of evidence, a1, is a perceptual experience that, by itself, lacks a clear upshot.
My prior credence that there was a snake in the house was unmoved by that
experience. Let S abbreviate that there’s a snake in the house. Then my credences
were as follows: c(S|a1) = c(S). Why think this? The experience was compatible
with a wide range of hypotheses most of which were non-serpentine hypotheses.
Similarly, for my toddler’s snake ‘report’, a2. His report of a snake lacked any
indication that there’s a snake in the house. If you doubt this, offer to babysit a few
toddlers for an evening while the parents get a needed evening out. So here to we
have the following: c(S|a2) = c(S). Finally, my six year old’s apparently make-
believe speech that there’s a snake a3 doesn’t move my prior credence that there’s a
snake in the house. As with the other items of evidence, it is unclear what exactly
the ‘reports’ are reports of. As quote marks indicate, the intentional object of the
report was unclear. Coherence often plays a role in interpreting speech. E.g., what
did she mean to say? She had to mean thus and so. The ‘had’ indicates an inference
is being made and that inference is supported by the rest of what we take to be true.
So the three reports were, in isolation from each other, not evidentially relevant.
But when the third event occurred, it became apparent that all three events
were, in fact, indications of a snake in the house. The coherence of the reports led to
a realization that the events were indeed evidentially relevant to the presence of a
snake in the house. It’s natural to describe the change as follows. By themselves
the reports were not evidentially relevant but the coherence of the reports showed
92
T. Poston

that they were evidentially relevant. The coherence of the report changed their
individual evidential role. Once I saw that the three reports were indications of a
snake, the individual reports then had power to move my prior credence.23
I take it for granted that each item of evidence is determinate. In each case
there is an item of evidence whose significance can be interpreted in a number of
ways. Coherence fixes an interpretation which boosts the probability of the
serpentine hypothesis. A different way coherence can confirm a hypothesis is
when it is unclear what the evidence is. This latter way conﬂicts with Bayesian
models which assume that the evidence is determinate.
In this story the evidential relevance of the information changes after learning
that the information is coherent. Prior to learning that the evidence is coherent, my
credence function includes (‡), that is c(ai|S) = c(ai|¬S). But after learning that the
evidence is coherent, my credence function changes so that c(ai|S) > c(ai|¬S). The
coherence of the reports leads to the realization that the individual reports are
indeed indications of the relevant fact. Thus, Olsson’s remark that “Some reports
must have a degree of credibility that is prior to any consideration of coherence, or
such agreement will fail to have any effect whatsoever on the probability of what is
reported”24 is not sensitive to the way that coherence can change the evidential
relevance of information. Similarly, Huemer’s remark one cannot manufacture
conﬁrmation by combining individually irrelevant information does not hit the
intended mark. It is correct that irrelevant information doesn’t magically become
relevant in sufﬁcient mass. But it’s wrong that the coherence of otherwise irrele-
vant information has no effect; in fact, it can lead to the realization that the
information is indeed relevant.
So, what is wrong with Huemer’s interpretation of BonJour’s intuition?
Huemer is correct that (No Cred) appears to characterize the idea that one’s
credence is unmoved by an individual report. But the error is that (No Cred) is
treated as a constraint on a probabilistic model according to which it must char-
acterize a subject’s credence at all times, both before learning that the information
is coherent and after learning that the information is coherent. But if coherence has
the power to change evidential relevance then (No Cred) shouldn’t be understood
as a constraint on a probabilistic model. Rather it should be taken as a feature of a
credence function at a time which new information may overturn.
23 There is a parallel here in ancient legal tradition. In the Hebrew Scriptures, a conviction cannot
be secured on a single witness report; convictions require multiple witness reports. Cf. Deuter-
onomy 19:15 “One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they
may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”
24 Olsson (2005, 69).
Coherence & Conﬁrmation
93

The variability of evidential relevance fits with BonJour’s original intuition. In
the passage quoted above note the significance BonJour places on the way coher-
ence can ‘evidentially dictate the hypothesis of truth-telling as the available
explanation of their agreement.’25 If we take (No Cred) as a constraint on probabi-
listic models then we lose the ability to come to see that the individual reports are
indeed responsive to the truth, i.e., we lose the ability to capture the correct
conclusion that the individuals are telling the truth. When we come to the conclu-
sion post-coherence that the individuals are reporting the truth then we take their
individual testimony to be evidence for the relevant claim. It’s no longer true that the
individual reports are like background noise with respect to the relevant claim.
Coherence turns what is otherwise noise into a harmony of individual voices.
When presenting this story and my epistemic analysis of it, I have been greeted
with tworesponses: acoherence friendlyresponse and a coherence hostileresponse.
The friendly response agrees that one’s rational credence may be unmoved by the
individual reports prior to learning that the information is coherent and that after
learning the evidence is coherent one’s credence is moved by the individual reports.
The hostile response has focused on pushing back on the idea that rational credence
is unmoved by the individual reports prior to learning that the information is
coherent. It is pointed out that, for example, an ideal Bayesian reasoner may be
moved ever so slightly to the serpentine hypothesis by playful toddler speak.
I have two responses to this line of thought. First, while an ideal Bayesian
reasoner may be so moved ever so slightly, the anti-coherence response requires that a
rationalBayesianreasonermustbesomoved.Thepurposeofthispaperistoshowthat
this is false; there are Bayesian models that capture this dynamic and cohere with the
story I want to tell in this section. Second, it may be possible to use therecentliterature
on imprecise credences to model the story I tell in this section. In this case what
happens is that one has imprecise credences on the relevant priors and likelihoods in
the story and then when one learns that the evidence is coherent, those imprecise
probabilities become precise and thus support the serpentine hypothesis.26
4 Coherence and Witness Reliability
The idea that coherence can change the evidential relevance of information is
similar to the idea that coherence can change one’s credence in the reliability of a
25 BonJour (1985, 145).
26 I lack space to develop this further. I hope to return to it in a future paper. Thanks to Julia Staffel
for this suggestion. For some recent literature on imprecise credences see Rinard (2017),

source of information. Erik Olsson has pursued this latter idea in connection with a
criticism of Huemer’s model of coherence justification. Huemer’s model does not
include different hypotheses about witness reliability which is crucial for both
Lewis’s and BonJour’s intuitions about the case. As both Lewis and BonJour see it,
the surprising agreement of witness testimonies increases one’s credence that they
are speaking the truth. Olsson builds a coherence model that incorporates different
hypotheses about witness reliability and then proves that coherence does not
increase credence apart from individual reports increasing credence. In the
following I explain Olsson’s result and situate my approach to coherence justifi-
cation in the context of a Lewis model.
4.1 Olsson on Lewis Models
In Lewis’s case there are two hypotheses concerning the witnesses; either the
witnesses are perfectly reliable or the witnesses randomly generate their reports.
The fact that witnesses report the same event is surprising on the assumption that
they randomly generate their reports. This surprising fact, it is claimed, lends
credence to the reliability hypothesis. Olsson proves that even in this setup the
surprising fact of coherence does not increase the probability that the reports are
true apart from the reports possessing some individual credibility. Let us review
this result and discuss its significance.
4.1.1 Initial Setup
Consider the following scenario in which there are two groups of witnesses to a
crime.27 One group is far away and another group is nearby. We do not know which
group any given witness belongs to. What we do know is that the nearby witnesses
are perfectly reliable and the faraway witnesses are perfectly unreliable (i.e., their
reports are generated randomly). Let’s take two witnesses Jones and Smith.
Consider these two hypotheses which we stipulate are mutually exclusive and
jointly exhaustive:
–
(R) Jones and Smith are completely reliable.
–
(U) Jones and Smith are completely unreliable.
Consider the proposition (F) = Forbes is the culprit. Let Ej,F indicate that Jones says
that Forbes in the culprit and let Es,F indicate that Smith says that Forbes is the
culprit.
27 The following paragraphs follow Olsson’s discussion closely.

Given our assumption that reliable witnesses are perfectly reliable, the
following claims are true.
(i) P(Ej, F|F ∧R) = 1 = P(Es, F|F ∧R).
(ii) P(Ej, F|¬F ∧R) = 0 = P(Es, F|¬F ∧R).
Foragreementtobesurprisingwestipulatethattherearemanymorewitnessesfurther
from the scene of the crime than close to the scene. We also stipulate that if the
witnesses are unreliable then they generate a report that Forbes did it with the same
probability that Forbes is the actual culprit. So we have the following two claims.
(iii) P(Ej, F|F ∧U) = P(F) = P(Es, F|F ∧U).
(iv) P(Ej, F|¬F ∧U) = P(F) = P(Es, F|¬F ∧U).
If, for instance, there are n suspects and exactly one of the suspects committed the
crime then, on the assumption of unreliability, the probability that Jones identiﬁes
Forbes as the culprit is 1/n. This probability is the same regardless of whether
Forbes is the actual culprit.
Next we introduce the independence assumptions. If they are reliable then this is
triviallysatisfiedonaccountofthefactthatthewitnessesareperfectlyreliable.Thatis,28
P(Ej, F|F ∧R) = 1 = P(Ej, F
⃒⃒⃒⃒F ∧R ∧Es, F).
We need to specify that the witnesses are conditionally independent on the
assumption that they are both unreliable. The following accomplish this.

P(Ej, F
⃒⃒⃒⃒F ∧U ∧Es, F) = P(Ej, F|F ∧U)
(vi)
P(Ej, F
⃒⃒⃒⃒¬ F ∧U ∧Es, F) = P(Ej, F|¬F ∧U)
Then we stipulate that the reliability profiles of the witnesses are independent of
the guilt or innocence of Forbes.
(vii) P(R|F) = P(R) = P(R| ¬ F)
(viii) P(U|F) = P(U) = P(U| ¬ F)
4.1.2 Coherence in a Lewis Model
We are now in a position to determine the probability that Forbes is the culprit
given coherent testimonies. By Bayes’s theorem,
P(F|Ej, F ∧Es, F) = P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|F) × P(F)
P(Ej, F ∧Es, F)
28 Mutatis mutandis, for each witness.
96
T. Poston

We determine the right-hand side as follows. First, start with the evidence that we
have two concurring testimonies. By the theorem of total probability and our setup
we have this:
P(Ej, F ∧Es, F) = P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|R)P(R) + P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|U)P(U)
Given our assumptions, this is equivalent to the following.
P(Ej, F ∧Es, F) = P(F)P(R) + P(F)2P(U).
The next quantity to determine isthe probability of the evidence given Forbes’s guilt.
We expand this using the theorem of total probability for conditional probability.
P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|F) = P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|R ∧F)P(R|F) + P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|U ∧F)P(U|F)
Given our assumptions, this we get the following:
P(Ej, F ∧Es, F|F) = P(R) + P(F)2Pr(U)
So, plugging these expressions into Bayes’s theorem and cancelling P(F) in the
numerator and denominator, gives us:
P(F|Ej, F ∧Es, F) = P(R) + P(F)2Pr(U)
P(R) + P(F)P(U)
We’ve assumed that R and U are exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses concerning
the reliability proﬁles of Jones and Smith. We can thus see by simple algebra that, if
P(U) = 1 then
P(F|Ej, F ∧Es, F) = P(F).
This result is not surprising. If we know that both witnesses are randomizers then
their reports have no evidential value and so the prior of Forbes’s guilt is un-
changed. Moreover, the concurring testimonies increases the probability of F only
if P(U) < 1.29 Putting this together, in a Lewis model, concurring testimonies
conﬁrm F if and only if P(U) < 1.
Now we can show that if P(U) < 1 and 0 < P(F) < 1 then P(F|Ej, S) > P(F). This
result proves that increase in credence provided by concurring witness testimonies
under the above conditions requires that the individual testimonies provide
conﬁrmation.
Given the setup, P(F|Ej, S) = P(R) + P(F)P(U).30 Given that R and U are
mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses concerning reliability, we can ex-
press
this
as
follows:
P(F|Ej, S) = (1 −P(U)) + P(F)P(U).
Suppose
that
P(F|Ej, S) = P(F) and that P(F) < 1. Then we have the following:
29 See appendix §11 for a proof.
30 See appendix §10 for a proof.
Coherence & Conﬁrmation
97

(1 −P(U)) + P(F)P(U) = P(F)
iff (1 −P(U)) = P(F) −P(F)P(U)
iff (1 −P(U)) = P(F)(1 −P(U))
If (1 −P(U)) > 0 then we divide both sides by (1 −P(U) to reach P(F) = 1 which
contradicts our stipulation that P(F) < 1. So (1 −P(U) = 0 and P(U) = 1.
The upshot is this. If we assume that the testimonies are individually
evidentially irrelevant, that is P(F|Ej, S) = P(F) = P(F|Es, F) and it’s not certain that
Forbes is guilty then P(U) = 1. In this case, there is no change in credence from
concurring testimonies. Conversely, if there is a change in credence from
concurring testimonies then there is a change in credence from the individual
testimonies. In a Lewis model, coherence increases the probability of a claim only
if the individual reports increase probability.
4.2 Lewis Models & Coherence Justiﬁcation
The Lewis model of coherence justification illustrates the interplay between hy-
potheses about witness reliability and coherence justification. The model shows
that coherence is a source of confirmation if and only if the individual evidence is a
source of confirmation. If a subject’s credences are unmoved by individual reports
then the Lewis model shows their credence in unreliability must be 1. In this case
my approach to coherence justification requires that once one learns that the
evidence is coherent one’s credence changes so that the hypothesis of reliability
receives some positive credence and hence the evidence becomes individually
relevant. This view is not as radical as may first seem for it is supported by clear
intuition and relates to standing difficulties with Bayesian updating.
Let’s start with the clear intuition. Often in the context of reasoning, we take for
granted some statements. When my spouse asks me to pick up our daughter from
ballet, I take for granted that she is not intentionally misleading me about our
daughter being at ballet. Consider a probabilistic example. I take a coin at random
from a jar of change I’ve collected. The coin looks to be perfectly normal currency. I
take it for granted that the coin is fair. That is, it is simply not up for short run
empirical verification that the coin has some bias. So each flip of the coin is taken to
be probabilistically independent of the other flips. But suppose that after flipping
the coin for 1000 times we get 723 heads. This is overwhelming evidence for a bias.
But note that if it is taken for granted that the coin is fair then there’s no way by
Bayesian updating to get the right intuition that 723 heads out of 1000 flips pro-
vides strong evidence for a bias without each individual flip providing some small
bit of evidence that the coin isn’t fair. The proof here runs exactly parallel to the
witness reliability model in Olsson. What happens in the coin flipping case is that
98
T. Poston

after a long sequence of flips, the mass of evidence calls for a reevaluation of what
is taken for granted, viz., the coin is fair.
The coin case and the coherence case can be treated alike by finding a
Bayesian model for assumptions. In the following I’ll treat an assumption as
having credence 1.31 As is well known if one’s credal state includes assigning unit
probability to some empirical claim then one cannot acquire new evidence such
that by Bayesian updating one comes to have less than complete conﬁdence in that
empirical claim. This is a problematic feature with Bayesian models because there
are cases in which empirical discoveries (e.g., the curvature of space-time) ratio-
nally leads one to revise entrenched assumptions (e.g., that light travels in a
straight line).
This is not news for the Bayesian. The core problem is that if one’s credence
function is mistaken in any number of ways then the rule of conditionalization
updates probabilities in accord with the mistakes. To solve this problem it requires
replacing the rule of conditionalization with a different rule for updating proba-
bilities. Christopher Meacham (2016) discusses this problem and proposes a
different rule that updates in accord with ur-priors. Let us consider Meacham’s
proposal and how it may be applied to coherence reasoning.32
Bayesianism is characterized by two core commitments: probabilism and
conditionalization. Probabilism specifies that one’s degrees of belief (one’s cre-
dences) should satisfy the axioms of probability calculus. Conditionalization
specifies that when a subject acquires new evidence, E, her degree of belief, say in
p, should change to what her old degree of belief in p is conditional on E. Thus, if
cre−(p) = n then, upon learning E, one’s new credence cre+(p) = cre−(p|e). Con-
ditionalization is often taken to be the only way one’s credence changes over time.
Bayesianism then offers the following counsel: start with initial credences that
satisfy the axioms of probability and then change credences by updating on new
information in light of those initial credences.
Meacham reviews standard complaints with conditionalization. Let’s consider
three. One complaint is that conditionalization doesn’t properly handle cases in
which a subject has updated incorrectly.33 Suppose a subject at t0 has credences cr0
and then acquires new evidence e1 at t1. She then updates on this evidence
incorrectly. She assigns cr1(⋅) ≠cr0(⋅|e1). She then acquires some new evidence e2
31 This can be modeled in Titelbaum’s Certainty Loss Framework (see Titelbaum 2013). Titelbaum
provides a Bayesian model that allows for claims to go from a credence of 1 to a credence less than
1. My proposal is to extend this to the role of assumptions.
32 The discussion here provides a way of capturing coherence reasoning within a commitment to
precise credences. The literature on imprecise credences may provide another way that doesn’t
require ur-prior conditionalization.
33 See Meacham (2016, 449–51).
Coherence & Conﬁrmation
99

at t2. What should her new credences be? If she follows conditionalization then her
new credences should be cr2 = cr1(⋅|e2). But this doesn’t seem correct because cr1
encodes a mistake. A better approach is to ﬁrst correct the error in cr1 and then
update accordingly. But, as Meacham argues, there’s no understanding of con-
ditionalization that allows for this.
A second complaint is that conditionalization doesn’t properly handle
changes in one’s views about the relevant merits of the theoretical virtues.34
Following Meacham, consider two theories T1 and T2 both compatible with the
available evidence. Suppose that T1 better satisﬁes some theoretical virtues, while
T2 satisﬁes other theoretical virtues. Suppose one starts off thinking that T1 is more
plausible on account of the fact that one thinks the virtues that T1 satisﬁes are more
important. Accordingly one’s credence in the ﬁrst theory is higher than one’s
credence in the second. But then suppose that on reﬂection one comes to switch
one’s view about the relative importance of the theoretical virtues. In this case
conditionalization cannot capture this change in credence because it’s not a case
of updating on new evidence; rather it’s a case of changing one’s beliefs about the
theoretical virtues. In this case change in credence requires changing in accord
with a new credence function that mirrors one’s new beliefs about the theoretical
virtues.
A third complaint about conditionalization is that it cannot handle cases in
which one learns about a new theory.35 Suppose there are exactly three theories,
T1, T2, and T3 that could explain some evidence E. One has never conceived of T3.
Yet when E occurs, one puzzles over it and comes to realize for the ﬁrst time that a
hitherto unknown theory T3 would explain E. One then comes to think that T1 ∨T2
is less plausible given E. The trouble is that conditionalization cannot capture this
change of belief. The reason is that prior to learning E one had the following
credence: c(T1 ∨T2|E) = 1.
Meacham observes that one may respond that conditionalization is intended
to describe ideal subjects. But Meacham points out that being unaware of a theory
doesn’t imply that one violates probabilism or conditionalization per se. But if we
do take this to be a case for non-ideal subjects then it becomes a case of error
correction.36
Meacham’s solution to each problematic case is to appeal to ur-prior con-
ditionalization. The core idea is that each change—error correction, change in
theoretical virtues, or learning about new theories—is modeled as changing one’s
existing credence function to a credence function that represents ‘ur-priors.’
34 See Meacham (2016, 452–53). See also Levi (1980).

Meacham considers three different ways of understanding an ur-prior function: a
subject’s initial credences, a function that bears the right relations to a subject’s
credences and evidence over time, and a function that represents a subject’s
evidential standards.37 I’ll work with the last option; the ur-prior function repre-
sents a subject’s evidential standards.
Let us consider briefly how ur-prior conditionalization answers the above
problems. We start with the idea that ur-prior conditionalization requires a move
from one’s existing credence function c to a new credence function c′ that more
accurately reﬂects the subject’s evidential standards.38 In the case of error correc-
tion, upon learning e2 one ought to change to a credence function that corrects for
the earlier mistake in updating. In the case of changing theoretical virtues one’s
credence function changes to reﬂect the new evaluation of the priors for theories. In
the case of learning about new theories, when one learns E and realizes that T3
would explain E, one’s credence function ought to change so that c′(T1 ∨T2) < 1.
Ur-prior conditionalization can be invoked to model the way coherence may
rationally change a subject’s confidence in some claim. We’ve seen that in a Lewis
witness model the following claims are true: (i) if one’s credence that the witnesses
are unreliable is less than certain then individual witness reports have some
credibility and (ii) if the individual witness reports have no effect on the content
then one is certain that the witnesses are unreliable. Olsson claims this is a formal
refutation of BonJour’s intuition that coherence can confirm even if the evidence
does not individually confirm. An appeal to ur-prior conditionalization can make
BonJour’s intuition compatible with Olsson’s discussion on Lewis models.
Let us begin by introducing a new atomic sentence ‘C’ which states that the
evidenceiscoherent.Whenoneacquiresmultiplelinesoftestimonytothesameevent,
one thereby learns C. Let’s suppose that prior to learning C, one’s credence function
includes that the reports are randomly generated. In terms of Lewis’s model, this
amounts to crC−(U) = 1 or in terms of Huemer’s original model it amounts to (No
Cred). However, upon learning C one is rationally moved to a new credence function
on which crC+(U) < 1 or that (No Cred) is false. Once one learns that C, the evidential
standards counsel a change in credence function to a ur-prior function on which one
has a non-zero credence that the reports are of the relevant fact.39
This illustrates how learning C has signiﬁcant epistemic upshot while also
granting that the impossibility result shows that individual credibility is a
37 Meacham (2016, 464).
38 These standards can be constrained by normative requirements. I ignore this extra
complication.
39 This does require that ur-priors are not regular, that is, that one may have unit credence to a
non-logical truth.
Coherence & Conﬁrmation

necessary condition for coherence justiﬁcation. Coherence rationally leads
one to revise the evidential signiﬁcance of individual pieces of evidence. We
can then revise BonJour’s formal intuition to get a statement consistent with
the impossibility result. Huemer and Olsson formulated BonJour’s intuition
thusly:
BonJour’s formal intuition: It is possible that c(A|Wi, A ∧Wj, A) > c(A) even if
(i) c(A|Wi, A) = c(A), (ii) c(A|Wj, A) = c(A), and (ii) the reports are conditionally
independent.
We can appeal to a change in credence function and to the idea of learning C to
get this:
BonJour’s formal intuition (revised): It is possible that crC+(A|Wi, A ∧
Wj, A) > crC+(A) even if (i) crC−(A|Wi, A) = crC−(A), (ii) crC−(A|Wj, A) = crC−(A), and
(ii) the reports are conditionally independent.
BonJour’s formal intuition thus revised recognizes that learning that C has
signiﬁcant epistemic effect. It changes one’s credence function from one in which
the evidence has no conﬁrmatory effect to one on which the evidence does have
conﬁrmatory effect. In the end this should not come as a surprise; for the power of
coherence lies in it showing that the individual items of evidence are indeed
indicative of reality.
5 A Garber Inspired Model of Coherence
We have seen that coherence may function to change the evidential relevance of
individual evidence. It turns out that we can develop this idea to secure confir-
mation by coherence without ur-prior conditionalization. The move is to introduce
an atomic sentence ‘C’ that represents that ‘the evidence is coherent’. This move
parallels Garber’s Bayesian solution to the problem of old evidence which involves
introducing as an atomic sentence the relevant logical fact that is learned.40 This
Garber-styled model also avoids a deeper problem with coherence proved by
Huemer in 2011. This is the problem of negative coherence justiﬁcation. I’ll begin
with an explanation of this problem and then move to the Garber inspired model of
coherence.41
40 See Garber (1983).

5.1 Confirmation by Negative Coherence
Huemer’s latest paper on coherence proves a theorem that minimal commitments
about the role of coherence imply the surprising result that negative coherence
provides confirmation. The theorem is as follows:42
(cr(H|E1) = cr(H|E2)
= cr(H)  &  cr(H|E1 ∧E2) > cr(H) ⇒cr(H| ¬ E1 ∧¬E2) > cr(H).
The theorem says that if the evidence has no individual credibility and yet the
evidence is relevant in mass then the falsity of the evidence confirms H. Here’s the
basic idea. The individual evidence is probabilistically independent of H. Baby
logic implies that e1 = (e1 & e2) ∨(e1 & ¬e2). Since e1 is independent of H,
(e1 & e2) ∨(e1 & ¬e2) is probabilistically independent of H. But by conﬁrmation by
coherence the ﬁrst disjunct increases the probability of H, so the second disjunct
decreases the probability H. Since e2 is independent of H so is ¬e2. But ¬e2 =
(¬e2 & e1) ∨(¬e2 & ¬e1). We’ve just seen that the ﬁrst disjunct must lower the
probability of H, so the second disjunct must raise the probability of H.
This is a surprising result. It is driven by the assumption of no-individual
credibility. If coherence functions to change the evidential relevance of the evidence
then this theorem isn’t relevant for the coherentist. Both the appeal to ur-prior
conditionalization and the model below avoid the problem of negative coherence.
5.2 Learning About Coherence
Recall BonJour’s core coherentist intuition is that isolated evidence does not
confirmation but coherent evidence does confirm. When one learns that an iso-
lated item of evidence is true, one learns something logically stronger than just e1;
one learns that e1 is true and that the evidence is not coherent. That is, one learns
e1 & ¬C. When one acquires multiple items of evidence that cohere with each other,
one learns not only that e1 & e2 but also one learns C.
We can then represent BonJour’s claim that isolated evidence offers no
confirmation as this: P(H|ei & ¬C) = P(H). Then coherence justiﬁcation requires
the following: P(H|ei & ej & C) > P(H). We can also add a condition that negative
coherence conﬁrmation is false. This yields: P(H| ¬ e1 ∧¬e2 ∧¬C) < P(H). We
then add conditional independence as before.
Confirmation by coherence is possible if the following conditions hold.
42 Huemer (2011).
Coherence & Conﬁrmation
103

1. cr(H|e1 ∧¬C) = cr(H)
2. cr(H|e2 ∧¬C) = cr(H)
3. cr(e1|e2 ∧H) = cr(e1|H)
4. cr(e2|e1 ∧H) = cr(e2|H)
5. cr(e1|e2 ∧¬H) = cr(e1| ¬ H)
6. cr(e2|e1 ∧¬H) = cr(e2| ¬ H)
7. cr(H|e1 ∧e2 ∧C) > cr(H)
8. cr(H| ¬ e1 ∧¬e2 ∧¬C) < cr(H)
The first two conditions capture no individual credibility formulated with the
additional sentence ¬C representing that when learns a single item of evidence and
that it is not coherent with other evidence then one’s credence in the target claim is
unmoved. Conditions 3–6, as before in the earlier discussions of coherence, specify
that the evidence is conditionally independent, Condition 7 speciﬁes conﬁrmation
by coherence. Given the individual evidence and its coherence, one’s credence in
the target claim is increased. But condition 8 speciﬁes that negative coherence
conﬁrmation is avoided. Given the individual evidence is false and that it is not
coherent, one’s credence in the target claim is reduced.
PrSat returns a model for these conditions.43

The crucial result demonstrates that coherence justification is possible
under the conditions of no individual credibility and coherence justification. It
shows that for an interpretation of C and for a probability function, it can be
the case that a mass of coherent evidence can increase credence under con-
ditions that capture BonJour’s original intuition. The upshot is that the formal
results have not closed the door on the possibility of coherence. Moreover, this
model is one in which the problem of negative coherence justiﬁcation is
avoided.
This model upholds the intuitive conditions of no-individual credibility and
conditional intuition. Huemer’s 2011 article ‘Does probability theory refute
coherence?’ attempts to secure conﬁrmation by coherence by replacing both no-
individual credibility and conditional independence with different probabilistic
conditions.44 Erik Olsson comments on this move:
Whatever merits Huemer’s new conditions might have, their standing in the literature is
hardly comparable to that of the original conditions. Conditional Independence, for
instance, is an extremely powerful and intuitive concept which has been put to fruitful
use in many areas in philosophy and computer science, the most spectacular example
being the theory of Bayesian networks (Pearl 1988). Similarly, the Nonfoundationalist
condition [i.e., no-individual credibility] is still the most widely used–and many would
say most natural–way of stating, in the language of probability theory, that a testimony
fails to support that which is testiﬁed. Thus, it would seem that coherentism is saved at
the price of disconnecting it from the way in which probability theory is standardly
applied.45
A primary virtue of the approach I’ve articulated in this essay is to maintain the
connection between coherentism and probability theory.
There are two natural questions about this model of coherentist justifica-
tion. First, does the new characterization of no-individual credibility combined
with conditional independence imply coherence justiﬁcation? That is, do the
ﬁrst six conditions imply the 7th (i.e., coherence justiﬁcation)? They do not.
PrSaT returns a model on which the ﬁrst six conditions are true and there is a
decrease in the credence of H given C and e1 and e2.46 There are models of the
ﬁrst six conditions in which cr(H|e1 ∧e2 ∧C) > cr(H) is true, models in which
cr(H|e1 ∧e2 ∧C) = cr(H) is true, and models in which cr(H|e1 ∧e2 ∧C) < cr(H)
is true.
44 For details see Huemer (2011, 41–44).
45 Olsson (2017).
46 See Appendix 12 for a model.
Coherence & Conﬁrmation

Second, how we should understand C? For the purposes of the model C is an
uninterpreted constant formally deﬁned in terms of conditions 1, 2, 7, & 8. We
can further specify a probabilistic content to C in terms of the condition:
cr(C|e1 ∧e2) > cr(C| ¬ e1 ∨¬e2). This speciﬁes that it is more likely that the evi-
dence is coherent given the truth of the evidence than give its falsity. Adding
this condition to the above eight conditions, yields the following model in
PrSat.
What should we think of this result? As commented above it secures the
desiderata for coherentist justification, but it does have some odd features. The
model treats C as logically independent from e1 and e2. See for instance rows 1
and 2. The model permits every truth-functional combination of C with the other
variables in the model, subject to the explicit conditions explained above. I’ve
attempted to impose further conditions on the model that rules out, for
instance, cases in which C is true while e1 and e2 are false, but PrSat does not
return a model when that is added in. It is area of further research to ﬁnd other
probabilistic conditions that may ﬁt better with an intuitive understanding of C.
But whether or not that is so, if we understand coherence in terms of explan-
atory relations that are not modeled truth-functionally we can make sense of
this model. In the case of row 2, there would be no explanatory relationships
between the evidence and hypothesis. Similar remarks hold for the other rows.

Thus we have a formal probabilistic model of coherentist justiﬁcation that can
be embedded within an explanatory coherentist epistemology.47
6 Conclusion
I’ve argued that the formal results on the role of coherence fail to have their
intended epistemic upshot. It is compatible with the former results that the indi-
vidual credibility of the evidence changes in response to facts about coherence.
Moreover, I have provided a Bayesian model that shows how learning that the
evidence is coherent can be evidentially relevant. The core flaw in interpreting the
formal results is to think that coherence has power only if the individual evidence
ﬁrst has power. The formal results are taken to show that coherence is always the
cart being pulled by the horse of individual credibility. But the friend of coherence
sees that coherence may be the horse pulling the cart of individual credibility.

P(A|Wi, A) = P(A) ⇔P(Wi, A|A) = P(Wi, A) ( † )
a = P(Wi, A|A)P(A) + P(Wi, A|¬A)P(¬A)
a = ah + c(1 −h)

Let P(A) = 1

⃒⃒⃒⃒¬ A) = k. Let each witness as
being equally reliable. Then we have the following

This proof demonstrates that the evidence that both i and j report A is, given
conditional independence and (No Cred), equal to the rate of reliability squared.
Huemer’s theorem then follows from this given Bayes’s theorem.
Proof
P(A|Wi, A ∧Wj, A)
= P(A) × P(Wi, A|A) × P(Wj, A|A)

I first prove that P(F|Ej, F) = P(R) + P(F)P(U). Then I prove that P(F|Ej, F) =
P(F|Es, F) = P(F) only if P(U) = 1.
Proof

= P(Ej, F
⃒⃒⃒⃒F ∧R)P(R|F) + P(Ej, F
⃒⃒⃒⃒F ∧U)P(U|F)
= P(R) + P(F)P(U) □
Proof
P(F|Ej, F) = P(F)
iff P(R) + P(F)P(U) = P(F) (by previous result)
iff P(R) = P(F) −P(F)P(U)
iff P(R) = P(F)(1 −P(U))
iff P(R) = P(F)P(R) by reliability assumptions
iff P(F) = 1. if P(R) = 0 then this reductio is blocked
11 Result
Prove that P(F|Ej, F ∧Es, F) > P(F|Ej, F) only if P(U) < 1.
By previous results and substitution, we need to prove that a+b2c
a+bc > a + bc only if
c < 1.
Proof
a + b2c
a + bc > a + bc
iff a + b2c > a2 + 2abc + b2 c2
iff (1 −c) + b2c > (1 −c)2 + 2bc(1 −c) + b2 c2
iff 1 −c + b2c > 1 + c2 −2c + 2bc −2bc2 + b2 c2
iff c(b2 −1) > c(c −2 + 2b −2bc + b2 c)
iff (b2 −1) > c −2 + 2b −2bc + b2 c
iff (b2 + 1) > c + 2b −2bc + b2 c
iff 1 + b2 −2b > c −2bc + b2 c
