The deﬁnition of consciousness remains a difﬁcult issue that requires urgent
understanding and resolution. Currently, consciousness research is an intensely focused
area of neuroscience. However, to establish a greater understanding of the concept of
consciousness, more detailed, intrinsic neurobiological research is needed. Additionally,
an accurate assessment of the level of consciousness may strengthen our awareness
of this concept and provide new ideas for patients undergoing clinical treatment of
consciousness disorders. In addition, research efforts that help elucidate the concept of
consciousness have important scientiﬁc and clinical signiﬁcance. This review presents
the latest progress in consciousness research and proposes our assumptions with
regard to the network of consciousness.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroscientists have conducted extensive research on consciousness for many years. In the past,
the traditional viewpoint was that consciousness required the proper functioning of midline brain
structures and that the content of an experience was supported by the activity of neurons in speciﬁc
areas of the cerebral cortex (Jang and Lee, 2015). The reticular neurons, and especially the neurons
of the ascending reticular activation system, play a vital role in maintaining behavioral arousal and
consciousness (Jones, 2003; Englo et al., 2017). However, in recent times, many diﬀerent opinions
have been proposed. For example, some researchers believe that consciousness is aroused in the
frontal region of the brain, including the prefrontal and central anterior cortex. Others believe
that consciousness is created in areas of the hindbrain, including the occipital/parietal and central
posterior regions of the brain (Koch et al., 2016; Seth, 2018). Questions that should be asked
include: where is the material basis of consciousness? The physical basis of consciousness is the
most important internal factor of consciousness.
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
WAKEFULNESS
According to the latest neurosurgical research there are two key features of consciousness: (1)
the state of consciousness (i.e., wakefulness) and (2) the content of consciousness (i.e., awareness)
(Zeman, 2006; Bayne et al., 2016; Fazekas and Overgaard, 2016). Furthermore, there are additional
features of the content of consciousness across the context of our brain (Figure 1). From the

perspective of neurosurgeons, more attention is paid on
wakefulness than on awareness because a disorder of this state
can lead to coma. In the clinic, comas, and the associated
vegetative state, are diﬃcult to resolve (van Erp et al., 2015;
Baricich et al., 2017).
Consciousness includes both the level of consciousness and
its content. The level of consciousness is key to maintaining
sobriety (Bayne et al., 2016). The generation of consciousness
content (Figure 1) depends on the integration of the various
sensations in the posterior cortex of the brain. Being able to stay
awake and aware of the outside world is a characteristic that we
associate with a conscious person (Fazekas and Overgaard, 2016).
In addition, to perceive the outside world, one must ﬁrst keep a
clear head; that is, waking is the ﬁrst step in the generation of
consciousness. Therefore, if one wishes to study the generation
of consciousness, one can start with wakefulness. Furthermore,
the opposite of awakening is coma, which is helpful for the study
of the mechanisms associated with clinical coma. Wakefulness
research is relatively easy when compared to the study of the
content of conscious because, unlike awareness, wakefulness can
be quantiﬁed and is easier to observe and record.
As a state of consciousness, wakefulness is diﬀerent in the
context of both sleeping and coma. These states are mild or
severe. For instance, one can wake up or semi-wake up, just as
one could have mild or deep anesthesia. We are usually conﬁdent
in judging a person’s state of consciousness (Zeman, 2006). In
the ﬁrst sense, with the help of objective criteria, including the
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), opening of the eyes usually indicates
the state of being awake, and being able to talk almost always
indicates further wakefulness. It is often thought that an awake
individual is also aware; however, this is not always true. Actually,
most of the content of consciousness is based on the state of
awakening, and brain activity during sleep is a special case.
Research on consciousness has always been diﬃcult. For
example, the deﬁnition of consciousness is very vague and
includes many aspects, such as the disciplines of psychology and
philosophy. Thus, there is no deﬁnitive conclusion. In addition,
the assessment of the level of consciousness is not an easy task.
Awakening is an important component of consciousness and is
also a well measured state by the availability of existing means.
Therefore, the scientiﬁc exploration of consciousness should
begin with research that is focused on the state of awakening. This
information may further reveal the mysteries of consciousness.
KEY NUCLEAR EVENTS RELATED TO
CONSCIOUSNESS: THE
PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS AND
CLAUSTRUM
Paraventricular
The paraventricular nucleus is an important neurosecretory
nucleus of the hypothalamus. Located in the medial area of
the hypothalamus, above the upper nucleus, the paraventricular
nucleus transmits from the pituitary gland to the posterior
pituitary (Maejima et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2018). Previous
studies have suggested that the paraventricular nucleus is an
endocrine nucleus that produces a variety of hormones, including
antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. Further, scientists have
revealed that there is an association between the paraventricular
nucleus and hunger, appetite, drug addiction, and behavioral
control (Krashes et al., 2014; Kirouac, 2015; Millan et al.,
2017). However, the paraventricular nucleus also promotes sleep
awakening and increases arousal (Kirouac, 2015). Orexin acts
upon orexin receptors and are involved in the regulation of
sleep-wakefulness (Ohno and Sakurai, 2008). Orexin neurons
around the lateral fornix of the hypothalamus are mainly
projected to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, which
is deeply involved in the control of motivated behaviors.
Orexin-activated paraventricular thalamus (PVT) neurons play
roles in the integration of sleep-wakefulness (Ishibashi et al.,
2005). Therefore, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus
may be the key site involved in the control of arousal.
This is consistent with the view that the PVT and thalamic
midline nuclei are associated with important physiological
mechanisms, such as attention, arousal, and consciousness
(Groenewegen and Berendse, 1994; Nascimento et al., 2008).
Moreover, the PVT is a member of the midline and intralaminar
group of thalamic nuclei that were originally hypothesized to
function as the thalamocortical arousal system (Jones, 2003)
and transmit information related to the state of awakening
(Van der Werf et al., 2002).
Clinical observations have indicated that the central region
of the thalamus is a key node for controlling the state of
awakening; however, the key nuclei or neural circuits of this
functional region remain unknown. By using in vivo ﬁber
photometry and multi-channel electrophysiological recordings
in mice, Dr. Hu (Ren et al., 2018) found that glutamatergic
neurons of the PVT showed high activity during waking, and
inhibition of PVT neuronal activity led to decreased arousal.
Additionally, activation of PVT neurons induced a transition
from sleep to arousal and from a waking-up process after

accelerated general anesthesia. This study also demonstrated that
the projection of the PVT nucleus accumbens and the projection
of orexin-secreting neurons from the lateral hypothalamus to the
PVT glutamatergic neurons represent the pathways that control
arousal. These results indicated that the PVT is the key thalamic
nucleus that controls arousal.
Claustrum
The claustrum is a thin, irregular sheet of neurons that is
attached to the underside of the neocortex in the center of
brain. It is suspected to be present in the brains of all mammals.
Although it is known that the claustrum and the cerebral cortex
are reciprocally connected, little is known about the actual
function of the claustrum. The claustrum and the frontal lobe
are interconnected, and it includes the motor cortex, prefrontal
cortex, and cingulate cortex; it also includes the occipital lobe of
the visual cortex, the temporal and temporal cortex, the occipital
and posterior parietal cortex, the frontal cap, the somatosensory
area, and the anterior axillary olfactory and entorhinal cortex
(Gattass et al., 2014; Goll et al., 2015; Torgerson et al., 2015;
Dehaene et al., 2017; Kitanishi and Matsuo, 2017; White et al.,
2018), which also projects into the hippocampus, amygdala and
the caudate nucleus (Milardi et al., 2015). The claustrum may be
closely related to the generation of consciousness since it provides
functional anatomical links between the frontal cortices and
the posterior sensory/association cortices (White and Mathur,
2018). The extensive reciprocal connections of the claustrum with
almost the entire neocortex prompted us to propose its role as a
gateway for perceptual information to the arousal system.
Koubeissi et al. (2014) reported that they were able to control
a woman’s consciousness by stimulating the claustrum. The
woman in this study was epileptic; thus, the researchers used
electrodes implanted deep in her brain to record signals from
diﬀerent brain regions during seizures in an attempt to cure her.
One of the electrodes was next to the claustrum, and when they
stimulated this area with a high-frequency current, the woman
lost consciousness. Additionally, she stopped reading, showed
“fragments” blankly, breathed slowly, and was unresponsive to
the audience and visual instructions. When the stimulus stopped,
she immediately regained consciousness and was completely
unaware of what had happened. The same situation occurred
several times during the test (Koubeissi et al., 2014). Another
experiment in 2015 also supported the fact that claustrum
may be associated with consciousness. The scientists in this
study examined 171 veterans with traumatic brain injuries and
observed the eﬀects of claustrum damage on consciousness. They
found that claustrum damage was associated with the duration of
the loss of consciousness, but not with the frequency. Moreover,
they believed that the claustrum played an important role in the
restoration of consciousness but that it had little to do with the
maintenance of consciousness (Chau et al., 2015).
Based on previous research, we assumed that consciousness
was generated by the claustrum, which acted as a command
center and formed a network covering the entire brain through
the interconnection of three types of neurons, including neurons
in the prefrontal lobe, the posterior frontal sulcus and the
occipital lobe region. We also assumed that the prefrontal
lobe and the state of high-level consciousness (cognition) were
functionally related. In addition, we believed that the most basic
form of consciousness may be generated by the posterior and
occipital regions of the central sulcus. Although the claustrum
is closely related to the cerebral cortex and various important
nuclei, its connection is diﬀerent. Most of the projection ﬁbers
of the cerebral cortex and nucleus that connect with the
claustrum are derived from the bilateral brain, and the nerve
ﬁbers emitted from the claustrum are mostly directed to one
side. In other words, the projection of the claustrum to the
outside is asymmetrical (Smith et al., 2017). Damage to the
claustrum of each cerebral hemisphere may also show some
diﬀerences, although these diﬀerences still need to be conﬁrmed
(Zingg et al., 2014).
VITAL CORTICAL CONSCIOUSNESS
REGIONS: THE HINDBRAIN AND
POSTERIOR CORTICAL REGION
By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we
are able to observe when the brain is unable to stimulate,
when corresponding regions are activated, and when neurons
become abnormally active. These diﬀerences were used in word
stimulation and visual decision task experiments, and it was
concluded that activation of the cerebral hemisphere depends on
the nature of the task rather than the stimulus itself. Whether
activated on the left or the right side, activation of the brain is
not in the prefrontal cortex. Rather, activation is observed in the
vicinity of the central sulcus and the back of the brain (Stephan
et al., 2003). In patients who underwent post-traumatic surgery
to remove some of brain regions, the vast majority of patients
(98%) remained in a persistent vegetative state after one year if
the resected section involved the posterior cortex (Boly et al.,
2017). Bianchi’s research also reached a similar conclusion, and
believed that lesions in the posterior cortex of the brain may
lead to permanent coma (Bianchi and Sims, 2008). Neurological
awareness is primarily anatomically located in the posterior
cortical thermal region, including the sensory region, rather
than the prefrontal network that is involved in task monitoring
and reporting (Merker, 2007). Reports of patients that remain
conscious after bilateral frontal lobe resection indicate that the
prefrontal cortex is not essential for consciousness (Rowland
and Mettler, 1949). Other parts of the cerebral hemisphere may
be potential candidates for the maintenance of consciousness,
including the back part of the brain.
CRUCIAL THEORIES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS: GLOBAL
WORKSPACE THEORY, INTEGRATED

THEORY
The most eﬀective way to solve problems associated with
consciousness is to use descriptions that have been introduced

Zhao et al.
Consciousness and Its New Conceptions
by psychologists and cognitive scientists who strive to connect
diﬀerent aspects of their models to the neuroanatomy and
neurophysiology of the brain (Harris and Shepherd, 2015). In the
history of consciousness research, several theories have attempted
to conceptually explain consciousness by presenting neural
correlations of the stream of consciousness. In the following
sections, we will discuss three of the most popular theories.
Global Workspace Theory
The global workspace (GW) theory of consciousness was ﬁrst
proposed by Baars in 1988 (Baars, 2005) and developed by
Dehaene et al. (1998). The GW theory is based on competition,
and its core idea is that conscious cognitive content can be used
globally for a variety of cognitive processes, including attention,
assessment, memory, and verbal reporting. According to the GW
theory, a single brain region cannot independently accomplish
the task of generating consciousness. Instead, consciousness
requires the joint participation and coordination of diﬀerent
parts of the cerebrum. This encourages us to not limit the concept
of consciousness to a single brain functional area or a star nucleus
and to explore the brain as a whole.
The GW theory posits that computers of the future will be
conscious (Thagard and Stewart, 2014; Dehaene et al., 2017).
There are some disadvantages of the GW theory. First, it provides,
at best, an account of the cognitive function of consciousness but
fails to address the deeper problem of the nature of consciousness
(i.e., what consciousness is) and how any mental process
can be conscious (i.e., the “hard problem of consciousness”
hypothesis) (Thagard and Stewart, 2014; LeDoux and Brown,
2017). Second, “while this hypothesis does not address the ‘hard
problem,’ namely, the very nature of consciousness, it constrains
a theory that attempts to do so, and provides important insights
into the relationship between consciousness and cognition”
(Northoﬀand Huang, 2017).
Integrated Information Theory
The essence of the integrated information theory (IIT) is
that consciousness is the capacity of a system to integrate
information. It is the most audacious current proposal of Giulio
Tononi’s hypothesis (Tononi, 2004). Instead of focusing on the
function of the cerebrum the IIT starts from the results in an
attempt to determine the reason. Moreover, the IIT presents a
mathematical framework for evaluating the quality and quantity
of consciousness (Tononi, 2012; Oizumi et al., 2014; Tononi
et al., 2016; Tsuchiya et al., 2016). This theory posits that the
physical basis of consciousness must be the maximization of
internal causal power and provide a means to determine the
quality and quantity of an experience (Tononi, 2004). The
theory leads to some counterintuitive predictions and can be
used to develop new tools for assessing consciousness in non-
communicative patients. However, the IIT proposes conditions
that are necessary for consciousness but that are not entirely
suﬃcient (Nathan and Barbosa, 2011). The IIT claims that all
of its axioms are self-evident (Kung et al., 2019). Since the IIT
is not a functionalist theory of consciousness, criticisms of non-
functionalism have been levied against it (Kung et al., 2019), and
the limits of the IIT’s deﬁnition of consciousness have led to
criticism (Nathan and Barbosa, 2011; Kung et al., 2019).
Quantum Theory
It is well known that consciousness is inextricably linked
to anesthesia. Hameroﬀet al. (2002) have conducted many
complementary and engaging studies to reﬁne their quantum
theory of consciousness. Moreover, a series of mechanics
of anesthetic agent function were proposed and included
the following: (1) selective binding in hydrophobic pockets
comprising non-polar amino acid groups in brain proteins
[e.g., microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs); tubulin; and
van der Waals (London dispersion) forces, which can inhibit
the quantum process by impairing electron mobility]; (2) a
specialized combination with “qubits,” fundamental information
units that abide by quantum events that induce disruption
of the quantum computation; (3) a concept of “quantum
channels” that consist of tryptophan tings in tubulin that
are olive-like, non-polar, and hydrophobic; (4) probability for
π-electron resonant energy transfer through quantum channels
and weakening of anesthetic agents that could therefore weaken
this π-resonance energy transfer (a theorem that accounts
for loss of consciousness); and (5) alterations of collective
terahertz dipole oscillations in tubulins (Hameroﬀ, 1998, 2006;
Hameroﬀet al., 2002; Craddock et al., 2015, 2017; Mayner
et al., 2018). The systematic theory of “Orch OR” proposed that
consciousness is constituted by discrete events that correspond
with varying oscillation frequencies of distinct brain regions
(Crick and Koch, 2003; Hameroﬀand Penrose, 2014; Li et al.,
2018), which is similar with respect to the “snapshots,” which
is one of the ten frameworks for consciousness proposed by
Koch (Li et al., 2018). In addition, an “integrate-and-ﬁre” brain
neuronal model and three time-steps of a microtubule automaton
have emerged from the above studies that embody speciﬁc
processing in neuronal microtubules when consciousness has
occurred. It seems increasingly feasible to explain consciousness
on the basis of quantum mechanics because Li et al. (2018)
demonstrated that an isotope of the anesthetic xenon (129Xe)
displayed half the quantum property of nuclear spin and was
conspicuously less potent than xenon isotopes lacking spin,
despite no observed diﬀerences in terms of chemical reactions
(Craddock et al., 2015, 2017).
Since the enigmatic riddle of consciousness is so intractable,
we need additional theorems and hypotheses to be generated
with the intent of increasing the level of attention. Perhaps this
quantum theory will fade with elapsing time and gradually lose
its “charm;” however, it is also possible to disperse the fog of
our ignorance and shed light on a new level of comprehending
consciousness and adopt a system of “wait and see.”

PVT (Groenewegen and Berendse, 1994; Van der Werf et al.,
2002; Ishibashi et al., 2005; Nascimento et al., 2008; Ohno and
Sakurai, 2008; Kirouac, 2015), the claustrum (Gattass et al.,
2014; Koubeissi et al., 2014; Chau et al., 2015; Goll et al., 2015;
Milardi et al., 2015; Torgerson et al., 2015; Dehaene et al., 2017;
Kitanishi and Matsuo, 2017; White and Mathur, 2018; White
et al., 2018), and the posterior cortex (the occipital and temporal
lobe) (Rowland and Mettler, 1949; Stephan et al., 2003; Merker,
2007; Bianchi and Sims, 2008; Koch et al., 2016; Boly et al., 2017).
Recent experimental studies have conﬁrmed that the PVT plays
a key role in animal arousal and that the animal’s arousal state
can be regulated by the PVT (Hameroﬀ, 2012; Kirouac, 2015). In
patients with epilepsy, the state of consciousness can be reversed
by stimulating the claustrum. Stimulation of the claustrum can
cause loss of consciousness and stop epilepsy (Koubeissi et al.,
2014). In addition, modern neuroscience research has suggested
that consciousness includes both awakening and consciousness
content. The generation of consciousness is from the awakening
to the transformation of the content of consciousness (Tononi
and Koch, 2015). Any problem that is associated with any one of
the links could lead to the decline of the level of consciousness
or even coma. The generation of consciousness depends on a
neurobiological basis. The neural mechanism that produces the
least consciousness is called the related neuron of consciousness
(NCC) (Crick and Koch, 2005; Cerullo, 2015; Tononi and Koch,
2015; Reddy and Pereira, 2017; Xie et al., 2017), which was ﬁrst
proposed by Crick and Koch (1990). The study of the NCC
is a key step toward research of consciousness. The NCC are
distributed in all parts of the brain (Koch et al., 2016; Boly
et al., 2017) and rely on neural networks or loops to function
with each other.
Based on recent research, we hypothesize that there is a
neural network of consciousness in which the paraventricular
nucleus formally serves as the control nucleus of arousal, which
is closely related to the maintenance of consciousness, and
the neurons in the posterior cerebral cortex. It is related to
the integration of feelings and the generation of consciousness
content. Besides, the claustrum also represents the key channel
of the consciousness loop and the transmission of control
information (Figure 2).
CONCLUSION
At present, consciousness is a very vague concept that lacks a
speciﬁc and accurate deﬁnition. It is now widely accepted that

Consciousness and Its New Conceptions
there are two categories of consciousness: (1) content-related
consciousness (i.e., the local state) and (2) the awakening state
(i.e., the global state) (Crick and Koch, 2003, 2005; Tononi,
2012; Tononi and Koch, 2015). Although we need to establish
a deﬁnition of consciousness, we should not be conﬁned by
the lack of deﬁnition. The cortex of each part of the brain
plays an important role in the production of consciousness,
especially the prefrontal and posterior occipital cortices and the
claustrum. From this review, we are more inclined to believe
that consciousness does not originate from a single brain section;
instead, we believe that it originates globally.
The exploration of the intrinsic neurobiological mechanism
of consciousness is of great signiﬁcance. According to the
latest research on consciousness, the paraventricular nucleus
plays an important role in awakening, and the claustrum may
represent the nucleus that controls information transmission and
regulates the generation of consciousness. The aspects involved
in consciousness include the level of consciousness and also
the content of consciousness. In the past, consciousness was
thought to emanate from the frontal hemispheres of the brain,
but current research has found that the content of consciousness
mainly originates from the hindbrain. According to the GW
theory and the IIT, awareness research requires a large neural
network. In order to understand the neurobiological mechanisms
of consciousness, the generation of consciousness needs to link
all of the critical nucleus functions and the cerebral cortex of the
essential brain parts. Consciousness is not split, but instead the
overall eﬀects of consciousness are critical.
