Introduction
The conclusion, if I am not mistaken, is that above all the
modern development of pure mathematics takes place under the
banner of number.

Introduction to the History of Modern Algebra
This book covers topics in the history of modern algebra. More precisely, it
looks at some topics in algebra and number theory and follows them from their
modest presence in mathematics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries into
the nineteenth century and sees how they were gradually transformed into what
we call modern algebra. Accordingly, it looks at some of the great success stories
in mathematics: Galois theory—the theory of when polynomial equations have
algebraic solutions—and algebraic number theory. So it confronts a question many
students ask themselves: how is it that university-level algebra is so very different
from school-level algebra?
The term ‘modern algebra’ was decisively introduced by van der Waerden in his
book Moderne Algebra (1931), and it is worth discussing what he meant by it, and
what was ‘modern’ about it. That it still sufﬁces as an accurate label for much of the
work done in the ﬁeld since is indicative of how powerful the movement was that
created the subject.
The primary meaning of the term ‘modern algebra’ is structural algebra: the study
of groups, rings, and ﬁelds. Interestingly, it does not usually include linear algebra
or functional analysis, despite the strong links between these branches, and applied
mathematicians may well encounter only a ﬁrst course in groups and nothing else.
Modern algebra is in many ways different from school algebra, a subject whose core
consists of the explicit solution of equations and modest excursions into geometry.
The reasons for the shift in meaning, and the ways in which structural algebra
grew out of old-style classical algebra, are among the major concerns of this book.
Elucidating these reasons, and tracing the implications of the transformation of
algebra, will take us from the later decades of the eighteenth century to the 1920s
and the milieu in which Moderne Algebra was written.

Introduction
Classical algebra confronted many problems in the late eighteenth century.
Among them was the so-called fundamental theorem of algebra, the claim that
every polynomial with real (or complex) coefﬁcients, has as many roots as its
degree. Because most experience with polynomial equations was tied to attempts
to solve them this problem overlapped with attempts to ﬁnd explicit formulae for
their solution, and once the polynomial had degree 5 or more no such formula was
known. The elusive formula was required to involve nothing more than addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division applied to the coefﬁcients of the equation
and the extraction of nth roots, so it was known as solution by radicals, and Lagrange
in 1770 was the ﬁrst to give reasons why the general quintic equation might not be
solvable by radicals.
Another source of problems in classical algebra was number theory. Fermat had
tried and largely failed to interest his contemporaries in the subject, but his writings
on the subject caught the attention of Euler in the eighteenth century. Euler wrote
extensively on them, and what he conjectured but could not prove was often, but not
always, soon proved by Lagrange. This left a range of partially answered questions
for their successors to pursue. For example, Fermat had shown that odd prime
numbers of the form x2 + y2 are precisely those of the form 4k + 1, and had found
similar theorems for primes of the form x2 + 2y2 and x2 + 3y2 but not for primes
of the form x2 + 5y2—why not, what was going on? There was a good theory of
integer solutions to the equation x2−Ay2 = 1, where A is a square-free integer, and
Lagrange had begun a theory of the general binary quadratic form, ax2+bxy +cy2,
but much remained to be done. And, famously today if less so in 1800, Fermat had
a conjecture about integer solutions to xn + yn = zn, n > 2 and had indeed shown
that there were no solutions when n = 4, and Euler had a suggestive but ﬂawed
proof of the case x3 + y3 = z3 that led into the theory of quadratic forms.
The nineteenth century began, in algebra, with Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeti-
cae (1801), the book that made Gauss’s name and may be said to have created
modern algebraic number theory, in the sense that it inspired an unbroken stream of
leading German mathematicians to take up and develop the subject.1 The work of
Gauss and later Dedekind is central to the story of the creation of modern algebra.
In the 1820s Abel had wrapped up the question of the quintic, and shown it was
not generally solvable by radicals. This raised a deeper question, one that Gauss
had already begun to consider: given that some polynomial equations of degree 5 or
more are solvable by radicals, which ones are and how can we tell? It was the great,
if obscure, achievement of Galois to show how this question can be answered, and
the implications of his ideas, many of them drawn out by Jordan in 1870, also uncoil
through the nineteenth century and ﬁgure largely in the story.
Algebraic number theory led mathematicians to the concept of commutative
rings, of which, after all, the integers are the canonical example, and Galois theory
led to the concepts of groups and ﬁelds. Other developments in nineteenth century
geometry—the rediscovery of projective geometry and the shocking discovery of
1Gauss also rediscovered the ﬁrst known asteroid in 1801.

non-Euclidean geometry—also contributed to the success of the group concept,
when Klein used it in the 1870s to unify the disparate branches of geometry.
The rise of structural mathematics was not without controversy. There was a
long-running argument between Kronecker and Dedekind about the proper nature
of algebraic number theory. There was less disagreement about the importance
of Galois’s ideas once they were properly published, 14 years after his untimely
death, but it took a generation to ﬁnd the right way to handle them and another for
the modern consensus to emerge. By the end of the century there was a marked
disagreement in the mathematical community about the relative importance of good
questions and abstract theory. This is not just a chicken-and-egg problem. Once it is
agreed that theory has a major place, it follows that people can work on theory alone,
and the subject has to grow to allow that. By and large, equations have contexts and
solving them is of value in that context, but what is the point of a theory of groups
when done for its own sake? Questions about integers may be interesting, but what
about an abstract theory of rings? These questions acquired solid answers, ones it
is the historians’ job to spell out, but they are legitimate, as are their descendants
today: higher category theory, anyone?
The end of the nineteenth century and the start of the 20th see the shift from
classical algebra to modern algebra, in the important sense that the structural
concepts move from the research frontier to the core and become not only the way in
which classical problems can be reformulated but a source of legitimate problems
themselves. This was a lengthy process, and the publication of Moderne Algebra
marks an important stage in what is still an ongoing process, one that is worth
thinking about. Leo Corry (1996) has usefully distinguished between what he calls
the ‘body’ and the ‘images’ of a piece of knowledge: the body of knowledge, he
tells us (1996, 3) “includes theories, ‘facts’, open problems”, the images “serve
as guiding principles, or selectors”, they “determine attitudes” about what is an
urgent problem demanding attention, what is relevant, what is a legitimate method,
what should be taught, and who has the authority to decide. It might indeed be
worth separating out the social and institutional factors entirely that could be called
the ‘forces of knowledge’: the mathematicians themselves and their institutions
(universities, professional bodies, journals, and the like).
I have tried to introduce students to some of the best writing in the history of
mathematics of the last 20 or 30 years, not just for the information these books
and papers provide but as introductions to how history can be written, and to help
students engage with other opinions and so form their own. The most relevant
examples are the The Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss’s Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae by Goldstein et al. (2007) and Corry’s Modern algebra and the rise
of mathematical structures (1996), both of which in their different ways show
how much can be done when one gets away from the monotonous plod of great
achievements. Kiernan’s inﬂuential paper ‘The development of Galois theory from
Lagrange to Artin’ (Kiernan 1971) is still well worth consulting. Such accounts

Introduction
are analytical, not merely descriptive. As Gauss famously said of his own work2
“When the building is ﬁnished the scaffolding can no longer be seen”; whatever the
merits and demerits of presenting mathematics that way little is gained by treating
the history of mathematics as an attempt to rebuild each branch of mathematics as
it is today, brick by brick, with names and dates attached.
In short, this is a book on the history of algebra, and as such it asks the student
to think about what it is to study history. It emphasises some points that a straight
mathematics course might marginalise, and it omits others that a mathematician
would emphasise, as and when I judged that a history course required it. It does
assume that the students can handle difﬁcult mathematics—and happily that proved
generally to be the case in the years I taught it at the University of Warwick—but it
requires that they marshal arguments, based on facts, and in support of opinions, as
historians must. I have tried to make it coherent, albeit selective.
It is not an attempt to write a ‘complete’ history of algebra in the nineteenth
century. It is the result of a course of 30 lectures, and it can be taught as such. Not
all the chapters correspond exactly to a lecture; some overshoot, and there is more
information in the Appendices. To reduce the study of algebra in the nineteenth
century and the early years of the 20th to barely 300 pages meant taking some crude
decisions, and I could see no tidy way to do it. Algebra in the period, it seems, is
a more heterogeneous body of knowledge than geometry was, and even real and
complex analysis (once differential equation s of all kinds are reserved for another
occasion). I removed most of invariant theory and the Kleinian view of geometry
from discussion. The history of work on determinants, matrices, linear algebra
generally, quaternions and other algebras had also to be omitted. But that only left
me facing tougher decisions. I decided not to deal with Galois’s second memoir,
Sophie Germain and her work, higher reciprocity laws, Fermat’s Last Theorem,
power series methods, and the distribution of prime numbers. Several of these topics
are well covered in the existing literature and would make good projects for students
wishing to take the subject further. Although it has become increasingly clear in
recent years that the work of Kummer, Kronecker, Hermite and others on the rich
and overlapping ﬁelds of elliptic functions, modular functions and n-ary quadratic
forms was a major legacy of Gauss, none of that could be described here. In fact it
makes a suitable subject for research.3 I could not, however, resist writing about the
importance of Klein’s famous but seldom-read Lectures on the Icosahedron (1884).
No undergraduate history course assumes that the students will be competent,
let alone masterful, in everything that matters to the course. Students study the
techniques of warfare without being able to ride a horse or ﬁre a gun; diplomacy
without being taught the skills of negotiation; nationalism without engaging in
politics; labour movements without working in a ﬁeld or a factory; childhood and

the family without becoming pregnant or rearing children. But there is a feeling that
the history of a branch of mathematics should not be taught without the students
acquiring something like the mastery of that branch that a straight course in it would
hope to achieve. This book is an attempt not to break that connection—students
should not say nonsense about quadratic reciprocity or which equations are solvable
by radicals—but to open it up to other approaches.
The ethics here are those of an applied mathematics course, in which a balance
is to be struck between the mathematics and the application. Doubtless this balance
is struck in many different ways in different courses. Here I have tried to bring out
what is important historically in the development of this or that part of algebra, and
to do so it is necessary to take some things for granted, say, that this person did
validly deduce this result although the proof will not be looked at. The historical
purpose in examining a strictly mathematical detail has to be decided case by case.
To give one example, perhaps the gravest in the book, the treatment of quadratic
reciprocity given here contains one complete proof of the general case (Gauss’s
third proof from 1808 in which he introduced Gauss’s Lemma) and indicates how
he gave an earlier proof, in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, that rested on his
technique of composition of forms (although I discuss the fourth and sixth proofs
in Appendix C). To explain composition of forms I indicate what is involved, and
give Dirichlet’s simpliﬁed account, but I merely hint at the difﬁculties involved
in securing the deepest results without which Gauss’s theory of quadratic form s
loses much of its force. This gives me room to explain the history of this famously
difﬁcult subject, but deprives the students of some key proofs. My judgement was
that this was enough for a history of modern algebra in which the contemporary and
subsequent appreciation of these ideas is at least as important as the accompanying
technicalities. I then go on to describe Dedekind’s translation of the theory into the
theory of modules and ideals that he created.
I also believe that sufﬁcient understanding of some topics for the purposes of a
history course is acquired by working with examples, and when these are not made
explicit there is always an implication that examples help.
In 1817 Gauss wrote (see Werke 2, pp. 159–160) that
It is characteristic of higher arithmetic that many of its most beautiful theorems can be
discovered by induction with the greatest of ease but have proofs that lie anywhere but near
at hand and are often found only after many fruitless investigations with the aid of deep
analysis and lucky combinations
Certainly numerical exploration and veriﬁcation are a good way to understand
many of the ideas in this book. That the proofs lie deep below the surface is one of
the principal impulses for the slow elaboration of modern algebra.

Introduction
Sources and Their Uses
Sources are at the heart of any historical account. In the last few years a huge amount
of original literature in the form of journals and books has become available over the
web, and this resource will continue to grow, but inevitably much of it is in French or
German. I have tried to note when translations are available (as they are for Gauss’s
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae and all of Galois’s work) and I have added some of my
own to the small collection that already exists. With a little effort more can be found
that is in English, although that remains a problem. I have tried to indicate what was
available in 2017.
Historians divide sources roughly into two kinds: primary and secondary.
Primary sources are the original words upon which the historian relies—here,
the papers, the unpublished notes, and the letters by mathematicians themselves.
Secondary sources are subsequent commentaries and other indirect records.
It will be no surprise that secondary sources for the history of mathematics on
the web are many and various. The best source for biographical information is the
Complete Dictionary of Scientiﬁc Biography. The biographies on the St Andrews
website began as digests of this work, but are now often more up-to-date and
with interesting references to further reading. The third source of information is
Wikipedia. This is generally accurate on mathematical topics, but a bit more hit-
or-miss on historical matters. After that it’s a lottery, and, of course, sources are
often ﬁlled with falsehoods lazily repeated, easy to ﬁnd elsewhere and hard to
refute. The only option is always to give your source for any signiﬁcant piece of
information. For a website supply a working URL, for a book or article the author,
title, and page number. Such references are to historians what purported proofs are to
mathematicians: ways of making claims plausible or, when unsuccessful, exposing
the error.
Solid reference works in the history of mathematics are generally quite good in
describing the growth of the body of knowledge in algebra. The facts of the matter
are often well known, although folk memory acts a ﬁlter: everyone knows that Gauss
was a number theorist, many fewer can describe his theory of quadratic forms;
everyone knows that Galois showed that the quintic is not solvable by radicals,
most people guess incorrectly how he did it. The problem is that mathematicians
today naturally suppose that the best mathematicians of the day respected the
same imperatives that they do—have the same images of algebra, one could say—
and in part this is because of the successes of the structural algebra movement.
Accordingly, what a history of a body of knowledge does not do well is analyse
either how the changes came about or what their implications were. The result is a
curiously ﬂat account, in which one really good idea follows another in a seemingly
inevitable way, although the development of algebra has its share of controversies,
of paths not taken, and dramatic shifts of interest.

Advice to Students
Throughout this book I want you, the student, to learn a number of things, each of
which has two aspects. I think of these as landmarks. One aspect is mathematical: I
want you to understand and remember certain results. The other aspect is historical:
I want you to understand the importance of those results for the development of
mathematics.
In each case you will have to do some preliminary work to get where I want
you to be. You will have to absorb some mathematical terms and deﬁnitions
in order to understand the result and have a good idea about its proof. You
will also have to absorb some sense of the intellectual enterprise of the mathe-
maticians and their social context to appreciate the historical dimension of their
results.
I have listed some key results below, almost in the order in which they occur in
the book. A good way to test your understanding as your study progresses would be
to ask yourself if you have understood these results both as pieces of mathematics
and as turning points in the history of mathematics. Understanding is a relative term;
aim for knowing the deﬁnitions and the best examples, the key steps in the proofs of
the main theorems and, equally important, a sense of the context in which the result
was ﬁrst proposed and what was signiﬁcant about it.
All these concepts will be taught as if they were new, although some familiarity
with the more elementary ones will be helpful; these include the basic deﬁnitions
and theorems in group theory and ring theory. The topic of continued fractions and
Pell’s equation is mentioned but marginalised here; it would make an interesting
project to go alongside what I have presented. The same is true of the Kleinian
view of geometry, which is an important source of group-theoretic ideas and
contributed signiﬁcantly to the recognition of their importance. On the other hand, I
assume no previous acquaintance with algebraic number theory (algebraic numbers,
algebraic integers, algebraic number ﬁelds, quadratic and cyclotomic ﬁelds, ideals,
the factorisation of algebraic integers into irreducibles, principal ideal domains, and
the prime factorisation of ideals) nor with a modern course in Galois theory, which
looks at the subject in more detail and from a more modern abstract perspective than
we do here.
The treatment of the mathematics in this book is surely not the modern one, rather
it is one closer to the original, but I believe that the formulations of a Dedekind or a
Jordan have a lucidity and a naturalness that commends them, and that in presenting
them it is possible to teach the mathematics through its history and in so doing to
teach its history in a full and interesting way. In particular, it becomes possible to
understand that substantial ideas in modern mathematics were introduced for good
and valuable reasons.
Any living body of knowledge is different from what is revealed by an autopsy.
Research mathematicians see problems, methods, and results, organised perhaps by
an image of mathematics, governed also by a sense of their own abilities. They have
problems they want to solve, which can be of various kinds, from just getting an

Introduction
answer to getting a known answer by a better method. They can be theory builders,
example ﬁnders, or problem solvers—all three at different times. What a study of the
history of mathematics can provide, albeit for the past, is the dynamic appreciation
of mathematics where research questions, their possible solutions, their difﬁculty
and importance are always visible.
This book, at least, has two sorts of aims. One is to describe some of the
major steps on the journey from classical algebra to modern algebra. The other
is to describe how some mathematicians have come to formulate, and even solve,
important new problems in mathematics. These two aims are more independent than
it might seem at ﬁrst glance. Firstly, the advances made by the mathematicians were
not aimed at creating modern algebra until the journey was more or less complete.
So we might well want to think of that journey as proceeding at random, in an
aimless way, and certainly not as the result of a design held for over a century or
longer. Secondly, the way research tasks get formulated and even solved is largely
independent of the over-arching story into which they can be made to ﬁt. A good
mathematician has a good grasp of (much of) what is known in a subject, and a
way of organising this knowledge so that it generates questions. Then, with luck,
he or she answers those questions, or, in failing, answers others that might, with
hindsight, seem better. Again, there is a random element here. The new insight is,
or is not, picked up by others and incorporated into their view of the subject, and so
the whole creaky ediﬁce advances.
We can think of a researcher (in any subject, I would think, not just mathematics)
having a story they tell themselves about their part of the subject. This story has
deﬁnitions, concepts, and theorems, and it culminates in things the mathematician
would like to know, which may or may not be what other mathematicians would
like to know. We can call this the local or personal story. The historian, or
the historically-minded mathematician, ﬁts some aspects of these local stories
together to get a global story—such as the origins of modern algebra. Most
likely the historian retains more of the personal stories and the mathematician
more of the results, probably re-writing them in modern terms as he or she
proceeds.
So understanding this book is a matter of appreciating the local stories, and
allowing them to ﬁt together in some way. This determines what your ﬁrst questions
have to be: What did this person know about the topic? What did he or she want
to know? How do they think they could do it? If you like, think of simply getting
to know several mathematicians on their own terms, without ﬁtting them into some
historical account you may have heard before.
To take these questions in order, the ﬁrst one does involve you understanding
the mathematics the mathematician understood. Perhaps the subject is new to you,
perhaps you know it already in a more modern form. I advise resisting the temptation
to tackle all the mathematics, but to give way sometimes. After all, you exercise the
same judgements when ﬁnding out about many interesting things, and you have
other things to do here, too. One thread to hold on to is provided by examples,
rather than theorems and proofs, and another is to able to describe the signiﬁcance
of a result (rather than merely repeat it).

Introduction
xiii
The second question is perhaps simpler. The answer will be of the form: Solve
this problem; Prove this theorem; Formulate some general principle. Again, the
signiﬁcance of these answers is as important as the answers themselves; what chance
did this or that problem have of engaging the interest of anyone else?
The third question is more about mathematical methods, but here we want to
notice a few things. These mathematicians did not always succeed: not completely,
and sometimes not at all. This highlights one difference between this book and
some histories of mathematics: it is not about who ﬁrst did what. It is about what
people were trying to do, and the extent to which they succeeded. Success can
take many forms, not all of them welcome: the counter-example, the refutation, the
unexpected example are all advances, but they may not ﬁt the picture people wanted
to create.
In most of the book each chapter has some exercises of a mathematical kind
to help you grapple with the concepts, and some questions of a more historical
nature to point you in the various directions that might help you contextualise the
mathematics and reveal how it was evolving. In the ﬁnal third of the book the
exercises fall away, because I believe that the conceptual shifts towards modern
mathematics are in fact clearer and easier to see from a slight distance than in the
close-up view that exercises provide.
When we look at the stories about the discovery of this or that piece of
mathematics and its path to acceptance, we also want to ﬁt them into the global
story we have chosen. Here we must be careful. Many historians would object
to an enterprise focussed on how some aspect of the modern world came into
being, ﬁnding the question too likely to lead to tendentious answers that lose too
much historical diversity. It is true that it is hard enough, and interesting enough,
to say accurately how and why Lagrange, Gauss, Galois or who ever did what
they did without imagining that we can explain how some part of the modern
world came about. But I think that the arrival of modern algebra is itself clearly
a historical event, and it is plausible to explain it in historical terms. We can do
this without supposing that everything was oriented to some great event in the
future.
There is a particular issue to do with how you handle information, especially
when it might be wrong. To repeat a historical falsehood (say, that Jacobi was
a Professor in Berlin all his working life) is a mistake (Jacobi was in fact at
Königsberg for most of his career), but it doubly misleading if it is relayed as an
important fact without a source.
But the more important distinction is between facts and opinions. The Jacobi
error is an error of fact. If you say, however, that Klein’s Erlangen programme
of 1872 was very important for the growth of group theory, that’s an opinion. It
may be true—I think it isn’t—but even if you want to argue that it is a valid
opinion, it is certainly an opinion. When you ﬁnd such claims in the literature, if
they matter to your essay you have to cite them. You do that by writing something
like “As Smith has argued (Smith 1972, p. 33) ...”, or, if you disagree, “Contrary
to what Smith has argued (Smith 1972, p. 33) ....” In each case (Smith 1972,
p. 33) refers to an item in your references by Smith (with an initial or ﬁrst name)

xiv
Introduction
published in 1972 (give the title and tell me how I can ﬁnd it) in which this
opinion is on page 33. You may also write “Smith (1972, 33) argued that ...”;
in this case the subject is Smith the person, and the parenthetical reference is
to an item in your bibliography. You do the same with quotations, of course.
If the item is on the web, you give the URL, and a page reference if that is
possible.
The fact–opinion distinction isn’t easy to maintain (when does a widely shared
opinion simply become a fact?) but it matters because there is not much you can
do with a well-established fact. Unless you suspect that it is wrong, and research
in the archives will refute it, you must accept it. But an opinion is an opinion.
Here’s one of mine: Dirichlet, who was a friend of Jacobi’s and did teach in
Berlin for many years, was hugely inﬂuential in bringing rigorous mathematics to
Germany and making Berlin in particular and Prussia generally a major centre for
mathematics. You can see it’s an opinion: I used the words “hugely inﬂuential”
and “major centre”. My evidence would have to be a major shift in the quality of
work done in mathematics in Prussia, most of it demonstrably linked to Dirichlet
directly or through the force of his example, and a clear rise of Berlin to a position
of international eminence.
This book is full of opinions, and I expect you to have yours. Even if we agree you
should have arguments in support of our opinions, and these arguments might not
be the same. Certainly if we disagree we should both have arguments. We can then
probe each other’s positions, shift our opinions, reﬁne them or agree to disagree. But
the fact–opinion distinction is central to this book, so if you are giving an opinion
taken from somewhere, say where it comes from.
Can you have too many references? In principle, yes. Will you, unless you set
out deliberately to do so—no!
I have provided a number of appendices. Some amplify the historical story, and
could be used instead of some of the later chapters of this book or as introductions
to projects. Some—those involving Gauss, Dedekind, and Jordan—also contain
translations of original material. One, on permutation groups, revises some material
that I did not want to assume or to teach historically, and it can be used as a reference.

Chapter 1
Simple Quadratic Forms
1.1
Introduction
In this chapter we look at two topics: the question of what numbers, and speciﬁcally
what primes, can be written in the form x2 ± ny2 for small, non-square positive
n?, and how to show that the equation x2 −Ay2 = 1 has solutions in integers for
positive, non-square integers A. Once we have seen what mathematical conclusions
we shall need, we look at how to handle the mathematics in a historical way—how
to use mathematics as evidence.
1.2
Sums of Squares
When n = 1, the question is: What primes are sums of two squares? It is easy to see
that 2 is, and working modulo 4 quickly shows that no prime of the form 4n −1 can
be. It turns out that every prime of the form 4n + 1 is a sum of squares, such as
5 = 22 + 12, 13 = 32 + 22, . . . .
Fermat was the ﬁrst to prove this. He mentioned it in a letter to Mersenne of 25
December 1640.1 No proof of his survives, but Weil (1984, 63) plausibly suggested
that the proof would have been much the same as the one Euler was later to claim.
1See Oeuvres de Fermat 2, 213, where he notes that the sum is unique. Fermat speciﬁcally
mentioned the method of inﬁnite descent in connection with this problem.

Simple Quadratic Forms
It is worth noting that it took Euler time to work out the details. He ﬁrst wrote
to his friend Goldbach about it in 1742, and told him that he had found a proof of
Fermat’s result in 1749, but only published his ﬁndings in 1758, and even then his
proof had a gap that he plugged only in 1760 (E 228 and E 241 respectively).2
Euler proceeded by considering divisors. If it can be shown that every divisor
of a number of the form x2 + y2 is also of that form, then the question reduces to
ﬁnding all primes of this form, because we have this lemma:
Lemma 1.1. A product of numbers of the form x2 + y2 is itself of the form x2 + y2.
Proof.
(x2 +y2)(u2 +v2) = (x +iy)(x −iy)(u+iv)(u−iv) = (x +iy)(u+iv)(x −iy)(u−iv) =
(xu −yv + i(xv + yu))(xu −yv −i(xv + yu)) = (xu −yv)2 + (xv + yu)2.
Also
(x2 +y2)(u2 +v2) = (x +iy)(x −iy)(u+iv)(u−iv) = (x +iy)(u−iv)(x −iy)(u+iv) =
(xu + yv −i(xv −yu))(xu + yv + i(xv + yu)) = (xu + yv)2 + (xv −yu)2.
So we ﬁnd
(x2 + y2)(u2 + v2) = (xu ± yv)2 + (xv ∓yu)2.
Euler next proved that no prime divisor of x2+y2 is of the form 4n−1 as follows.
Suppose there is such a prime, say p. We can assume that x is prime to y and that
both are prime to p.3 So we have
x2 ≡−y2 (mod p).
But we may write p −1 = 2m, where m = 2n −1, so m is odd and we have
x2m ≡−y2m (mod p).
But by Fermat’s little theorem,
x2m ≡y2m (mod p).
2These numbers refer to Eneström’s catalogue of Euler’s works; I shall generally refer to Euler’s
works by their E number. The catalogue, and almost of all Euler’s work, is available in the
invaluable Euler Archive on the web. The Euler–Goldbach correspondence has recently been
published as Euler (2015), see letters 47 and 138.
3Here and throughout we use the now-familiar ≡symbol for congruences. It was ﬁrst introduced
by Gauss, as is explained below in Sect. 4.3.

1.2
Sums of Squares

From this contradiction it follows that the initial assumption must be wrong, and no
prime divisor of a sum of squares is of the form 4n −1.
Note also that what this shows is that −1 is a square mod p, where p is an odd
prime, only if p is of the form 4n + 1. It remains to show that if p is of the form
4n + 1 then there are integers x and y such that x2 + y2 = p. It is this detail that
Euler fudged in 1758.
The best account of this material that I know is Cox’s book with the very honest
title: Primes of the form x2 + ny2 (1989). There he sketches a slight reworking of
Euler’s argument in this form. There is what he called the descent step and then
there is a reciprocity step—the names will become clear as we proceed.
Descent: Prime divisors of x2 + y2, where gcd(x, y) = 1, are of the form x2 + y2.
Reciprocity: Primes of the form 4n + 1 divide some x2 + y2 where gcd(x, y) = 1.
Descent goes like this. From the identity in the above Lemma,
(x2 + y2)(u2 + v2) = (xu ± yv)2 + (xv ∓yu)2,
Euler deduced that if N = a2 + b2, where a and b are relatively prime, and if
q = x2 + y2 is a prime divisor of N, then N/q is also a sum of two relatively prime
squares. Once that is proved, it follows that all prime divisors of an x2 + y2 are of
this form, by an inﬁnite descent argument that I’ll sketch below.
To get started, notice that if a2 + b2 = (x2 + y2)(c2 + d2) then by the lemma
a = (xc ± yd) and b = (xd ∓yc), which is a powerful clue as to how to carry
out the proof. Indeed, to show that if q = x2 + y2 divides N = a2 + b2, where x
and y are relatively prime, then N/q is also a sum of relatively prime squares, Euler
argued as follows.4
Lemma 1.2. If q = x2 + y2 divides N = a2 + b2, where a and b are relatively
prime, then N/q is also a sum of relatively prime squares.
Proof. q divides x2N −a2q = (xb−ay)(xb+ay),and because q is prime it divides
one of these factors. Without loss of generality, we can assume q divides xb −ay.
Say xb −ay = dq, for some integer d.
Euler now proved that x divided a + dy by showing that it divided (a + dy)y;
this uses the fact that x and y are relatively prime. This last claim is true because
(a + dy)y = xb −dx2, which is obviously divisible by x. So he could set a + dy =
cx, and deduce that
a = cx −dy, b = dx + cy.
Euler then put all this back together and deduced that
N = a2 + b2 = (x2 + y2)(c2 + d2) = q(c2 + d2),
4See Euler (2015, letter 115), and the Euler Archive, Correspondence, Goldbach, letter CV of 6
May 1747, OO829.

Simple Quadratic Forms
so
N/q = c2 + d2,
as required (c and d are relatively prime because a and b are).
Descent arguments work by contradiction, so suppose that p is a prime dividing
N = a2 + b2 and that p is not a sum of two squares. A descent argument will show
that there is a prime q that divides N, is not a sum of two squares, and is smaller
than p. Iterating this argument produces a contradiction.
Notice that the above Lemma shows that if pq is a sum of two squares and one
of p and q is a sum of squares, then so is the other one.
Now, to arrange that any q that divides N is smaller than p we resort to a trick.
If, say, a = a1 + kp then from the fact that p divides a2 + b2 we deduce that p
divides a2
1 + b2. So by adding or subtracting suitable multiples of p to or from a
and b we can assume that p divides N1 = a2
1 + b2
1, where |a| < p/2 and |b| < p/2.
If we throw away any common factors of a1 and b1 those inequalities are still true,
and together they imply that N1 < p2/2. This implies that any divisor of N1 is less
than p.
Now consider any divisor q of N1 other than p. If each one is a sum of two
relatively prime squares then so is their product, and therefore so is N1 divided by
that product, which is p. Therefore at least one q is not a sum of two relatively prime
squares. But it is less than p, and the descent argument applies, and the descent claim
is proved: Prime divisors of x2 + y2, where gcd(x, y) = 1 are of the form x2 + y2.
Reciprocity is always harder, because we have either to ﬁnd x and y or to give
an abstract existence proof. Cox gives this nice argument, but one not available to
Euler: Fermat’s little theorem implies that if p = 4n + 1 is prime then
r4n −1 ≡0 mod p
so
(r2n + 1)(r2n −1) ≡0 modp.
So if we can ﬁnd an r such that r2n −1 ≡0 mod p is not true then we must have
r2n + 1 ≡0 mod p,
which expresses p as a divisor of a sum of squares, and we are done (by the descent
step). For us, but not for Euler, it is true that only 2n of the 4n values of r mod p
can satisfy r2n −1 ≡0 mod p, so the existence of the required r is trivial.
On the other hand, producing such an r explicitly is not trivial. Consider, for
example, the case p = 101. We are required to ﬁnd an r such that r50 ≡
−1 mod101. Even in this small case it’s clearly going to be time-consuming to do

this; we must do something like calculate
r, r2, r4, r8, r16, r32, r48 ≡r16 · r32 and r50 ≡r2 · r48 mod 101
for different values of r until we get lucky—which, as it happens, we do with the
natural ﬁrst choice, r = 2. Doing a few explicit calculations of this sort should
make you want to look for a theory to cut down on all the work, which in turn
means looking for a property that 2 has modulo 101 that is not shared with every
other integer modulo 101. The crucial property is that 2 is what is called a ‘primitive
root’ modulo 101 (see Sect. 4.3 below) but unfortunately there is no simple way in
general of ﬁnding primitive roots.
To ﬁnd x and y explicitly, we write 250 as (22)25, and set x/y ≡225 mod 101.
We are free to choose an easy value of y, such as 1 or 2, and if we choose y = 1
then we ﬁnd x ≡225 ≡10 mod101 and we deduce that 101 divides x2 + y2 =
102 + 12 = 101, which indeed it does.

In a history course we need merely to check that Euler did this, in order to be able
to say that Euler did prove this result. If we are satisﬁed that there is nothing unduly
novel in the proof, we need not concern ourselves with the proof ever again. That
will be the case here, so, unless a historical question arises for which Euler’s proof
is interesting, we need not have attempted to master this mathematical step. But we
can easily see that it is a piece of straight-forward (if clever) elementary algebra.
Modiﬁed Sums of Squares
Others of Fermat’s discoveries were to inspire Euler to prove them and in so doing
start modern number theory. The claims date from 1654, in a letter to Blaise Pascal;
again, no proof of his has come down to us.5
Every prime which surpasses by one a multiple of three is composed of a square and the
triple of another square. Examples are 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, etc.
Every prime which surpasses by one or three a multiple of eight is composed of a square
and the double of another square. Examples are 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, etc.
Euler showed in each case that prime divisors of numbers of the form x2 + 2y2
(respectively x2 + 3y2) are again of the form x2 + 2y2 (respectively x2 + 3y2).
He used the same two-step way: descent and reciprocity. It took him (on and off)
5See Fermat, Oeuvres 2, 310–314, esp. p. 313; quoted in Cox (1989, 8).

30 years. These remarks of Fermat establish for which primes p it is the case that
−2 and −3 are squares mod p.
However, with x2 + 5y2, something unexpected happens. The identity
(x2 + 5y2)(u2 + 5v2) = (xu ± 5yv)2 + 5(xv ∓yu)2
shows that the product of two numbers of the form x2 + 5y2 is again of this form.
But it is not true that every divisor of a number of this form is again of that form.
For example,
21 = 12 + 5 × 22 = 3 × 7,
but neither 3 nor 7 is of the required form. To give another example, 7×23 = 161 =
62 + 5 · 52.
Fermat conjectured, but admitted that he could not prove, that primes that are
congruent to 3 or 7 mod 20 have products that are of the form x2 + 5y2. The primes
of the form x2 + 5y2 that are less than 300 are 29, 41, 61, 101, 109, 149, 229, 241,
and 269, and Fermat did not capture them; note that they are all congruent to either
1 or 9 mod 20. Fermat could only conjecture—but not prove—this statement about
the divisors of numbers of the form x2 + 5y2:
If two primes, which end in 3 or 7 and surpass by three a multiple of four, are multiplied,
then their product will be composed of a square and the quintuple of another square.6
As this quote reminds us, Fermat made his discoveries without the advantage of
a good notation. His congruence condition, for example, can be more simply stated
as the primes are congruent to 3 or 7 modulo 20.
We get an interesting glimpse of what Euler knew in 1753 from this exchange
with his friend Christian Goldbach.7 Goldbach wrote to Euler on 12 March to say
that he had found that if p is a prime of the form 4dm+1 then p can be represented
as p = da2 + b2. Euler replied on 3 April that he had noticed this theorem some
time ago “and I am just as convinced of its truth as if I had a proof of it”, and then
gave these examples:
p = 4.1m + 1 ⇒p = aa + bb
p = 4.2m + 1 ⇒p = 2aa + bb
p = 4.3m + 1 ⇒p = 3aa + bb
p = 4.5m + 1 ⇒p = 5aa + bb.

p. 405, and Oeuvres, 3, 314–319 (in French) see p. 317. Quoted in Cox (1989, 8).

He then remarked that he could only prove the ﬁrst of these claims, but not the rest,
and to observe that the claim was only true in general when a and b are allowed to
be rational numbers, giving the example

where 89 cannot be written in the form 11a2 + b2 with a and b integers.8 Later he
found a proof of the second of the above claims; the others were to be established
by Lagrange.
1.3
Pell’s Equation
For once it is reasonable to begin with a string of negatives. The study of the
equation has nothing to do with Pell, an English mathematician of the seventeenth
century—the attribution started with a simple mistake by Euler. It has a lot to
do with Fermat, but he was not the ﬁrst to take the problem up, although he
could not have known that it had already been worked on thoroughly by an Indian
mathematician, Brahmagupta, who was born in AD 598. Neither Brahmagupta nor
Fermat have left us their methods, and we must exercise a little charity if we credit
Brahmagupta with working out all the elementary theory, but as we will see there
are good reasons for believing he had a deep understanding of the problem.9
In any case, the problem is to ﬁnd, for a given non-square integer A, integers x
and y such that
x2 −Ay2 = 1.
The simplest cases can be done by guesswork:
•
A = 2: we have (x, y) = (3, 2);
•
A = 3: we have (x, y) = (7, 4);
•
A = 5: we have (x, y) = (9, 4).
There is a close connection between Pell’s equation and the approximation of
irrational square roots by rational numbers, which was developed for the ﬁrst time
by Lagrange in his (1769), and presented more accessibly in his Additions to the
French translation of Euler’s Algebra (1770).10 Consider, for example, the question

of Euler’s Algebra published in 1840 and reprinted in 1984.

so solutions to this equation give approximations to

improve as y gets larger. To ﬁnd these approximations, we use the method of
continued fractions, as follows. We have

which we write this way:
[2, 4, 4, 4, . . .].
The continued fraction expansions of

7 and

13 can also be found in this way.
They also cycle; indeed, it is a theorem that the expansions of √n all cycle (when n
is not a perfect square). Much less is known about the continued fraction expansions
of almost any other type of irrational number.
The successive approximations to the continued fraction [a, b1, b2, . . . , bn, . . .]
are
a, [a, b1], [a, b1, b2], . . . [a, b1, b2, . . . , bn].

They are called the convergents. The connection with continued fraction expansions
and square roots is that the convergents alternately over- and under-estimate the
square root in a fashion that converges very quickly.
Let us take the case A = 5. We do indeed have
92 −5 · 42 = 81 −80 = 1,
so re-writing Pell’s equation in the form Ay2 = x2 −1 and then in the form

which says that 9/4 is an approximation to
√
5. To be sure, not a good one, but we
can do better. The successive convergents are
[2, 4, 4, 4, . . .].
These approximations are successively

The square of the last number is 5.0002 to four decimal places.
There is a useful identity:
(x2 + ny2)(u2 + nv2) = (xu ± nyv)2 + n(xv ∓yu)2.
So the product of two terms of the form x2 + ny2 is again of that form. If we take
n = −5, the useful identity says
(x2 −5y2)(u2 −5v2) = (xu −(−5)yv)2 + (−5)(xv + yu)2.
Let us take
(x, y) = (9, 4) = (u, v).

10

Simple Quadratic Forms
We ﬁnd
(xu −(−5)yv) = 161, and (xv + yu) = 72.
It will be helpful to write the useful identity in the form
(x, y) ∗(u, v) = (xu ± nyv, xv ∓yu).
In modern terms, we have the set of integer pairs {(x, y) | x2 + ny2 = 1} which is
closed under multiplication by ∗. We don’t know for sure that this set is non-empty,
but if it is then the next question is: is it a group? And the question after that is: what
sort of a group? (Plainly, it will be a commutative one.)
Now, it is a fact about continued fractions that they alternately over- and under-
estimate the number they converge to. This is proved in most books on the subject
(e.g. Khinchin 1964) and stated correctly, but not proved, in Wikipedia (the proof is
not difﬁcult). So the values (x, y) = (38, 17) that we obtained are going to give us
a different kind of approximation to
√
5, and indeed 382 −5 · 172 = −1. Now, if it
is allowed to approximate
√
5 that way, and solve x2 −5y2 = −1, we could have
started with smaller numbers: (x, y) = (2, 1). Let us calculate
(2, 1) ∗(2, 1) = (9, 4).
We have worked our way back to the historical starting point. Brahmagupta’s
idea was that if we make a guess at values of x and y such that x2 −Ay2 = 1 for
a given (non-square) integer A we can use it to generate another guess, by this ∗
method. Usually this will produce a worse pair of x and y, but we can intervene and
make a better guess than the one the ∗method provides. In this way we can guide
the pairs down to a value of x and y for which, in fact, x2 −Ay2 = 1. This is what
Bh¯askara II did.
Brahmagupta and Bh¯askara II
The Indian astronomer Brahmagupta wrote his Br¯ahma-sphut.a-siddh¯anta when he
was 30. It is one of the works from which the zero symbol and the decimal place
value system came to Europe, along with the Hindu-Arabic numerals.11
Most of the book is devoted to improvements in theoretical astronomy, and some
chapters are on arithmetic and on geometry. Chapter 18, however, was much more

algebraic. Here Brahmagupta discussed how to solve some equations of the form
Nx2 + k = y2 ,
(in modern notation) for positive integers N and small values of k (such as ±1, ±2
or 4); for example, when N = 5 and k = 1, the smallest solution is x = 4, y = 9,
since
(5 × 42) + 1 = 81 = 92 .
Brahmagupta’s success is a formidable achievement because trial and error
speedily exhausts the hardiest of calculators without success. Particularly striking is
his success with N = 61 and k = 1: here the smallest solution, which he succeeded
in ﬁnding, is x = 226,153,980 and y = 1,866,319,049. It is clear that he must have
had a general method, but all that have come down to us are hints that allow one to
take solutions to the problem and produce others.12
A great advance of Bh¯askara II in his B¯ija-gan. ita (Seed computation) written in
1150, was to discover a general method for solving this problem. It is the chakravala
or cyclic method, and starts by guessing a solution to a ‘nearby’ equation. It is
not clear if Bh¯askara II could prove that the cyclic method always works. Plofker
comments (see Plofker in Katz 2007, 474)
It is not known how, or whether, Indian mathematicians showed that this method would
always provide a solution after a ﬁnite number of cycles.
The cyclic method begins by assuming that x = a, y = b solves the problem
Nx2+k = y2 for a small value of k. This can always be done, because x = 1, y = m
is a solution of N ·x2 +(m2 −N) = y2. Bh¯askara then used Brahmagupta’s method
of combining solutions to deduce that, for any number b,
N(am + b)2 + (m2 −N)k = (bm + Na)2.
This implies that x = (am + b)/k, y = (bm + Na)/k is a solution of
Nx2 + (m2 −N)/k = y2.
Bh¯askara now chose a number m such that am + b is divisible by k. This implies
that m2 −N and bm + Na are also divisible by k, and so
x = (am + b)/k, y = (bm + Na)/k
12See the discussion in Plofker (2009, 154–156).

Simple Quadratic Forms
are integer solutions of the equation Nx2+(m2−N)/k = y2, where (m2−N)/k is
also an integer. The trick is to try to make (m2 −N)/k smaller than k and then hope
to repeat this argument until a solution of the equation Nx2 + 1 = y2 is obtained.
Consider one of Bh¯askara’s more dramatic examples. To solve the equation
61x2 + 1 = y2
he needed to ﬁnd a number m so that (m + 8)/3 is an integer and m2 −61 is as
small as possible. So he took m = 7 and obtained x = 5, y = 39 as a solution
of the equation 61x2 −4 = y2. Using Brahmagupta’s method he then found x =
226,153,980, y = 1,866,319,049 as the smallest solution of 61x2 + 1 = y2.
In fact, Bh¯askara always stopped when (m2 −n)/k is one of the numbers
±1, ±2 or ± 4, for then he could apply Brahmagupta’s method to ﬁnd a solution to
the equation nx2 + 1 = y2. It seems clear that he knew his method always worked,
although he gave no proof.
Fermat too liked to tantalise his readers with very large numbers. In 1656,
apparently despairing of ﬁnding French mathematicians interested in problems
about numbers, he challenged the mathematicians of Europe to solve these sorts
of problems, and John Wallis and Lord Brouncker in England succeeded, with an
independent rediscovery of the cyclic method. For an account of their work, which
gives more credit to Brouncker than hitherto, see Stedall (2000a, b).

Let it be required to divide 16 into two squares.
And let the ﬁrst square = x2; then the other will be 16 −x2; it shall be required therefore
to make 16 −x2 = a square.
I take a square of the form (mx −4)2, m being any integer and 4 the root of 16; for example,
let the side be 2x −4, and the square itself 4x2 +16−16x. Then 4x2 +16−16x = 16−x2.

for a fallacious argument. If so, it seems that we will never know if he also, later,
found the ﬂaw in his “truly marvellous demonstration”. The marginal note was not
published until after his death, in the edition of his works made by his son Samuel in
1679. By the way, it should not, strictly, be called his last theorem, not only because
it was not, until recently, a theorem but only a conjecture, but also because it is not
Fermat’s last unproved claim. He also raised the question of which integers can be
the areas of triangles with sides that are rational numbers. Arabic writers knew of a
triangle of this kind with area 5, and Leonardo of Pisa had claimed such a triangle
cannot have area 1. Fermat proved this, his argument essentially settling Fermat’s
Last Theorem in the case n = 4. It is now known that the smallest possible value
for the area is 5, but the general problem remains unsolved.1
Fermat’s greatest achievement in number theory was his resolution of this case
of his ‘last’ theorem: his proof that there are no non-zero integer solutions to the
equation x4 + y4 = z4. His interest in this problem is another illustration of how
simultaneously ‘modern’ and ‘ancient’ he was. He took the problem from a note
Bachet had put in Book VI of his edition of Diophantus’s Arithmetica. Diophantus
had raised problems about triangles whose areas plus or minus a number are squares,
and Bachet added the remark that if A is the area of a right-angled triangle with
integer sides then there is number K such that (2A)2 −K4 is a square. To see this,
observe that we want to ﬁnd integers K and s such that

2pq(p2 −q2)
2
+ K4 = s2.
We have

2pq(p2 −q2)
2
= 4p2q2(p2 −q2)2
= 4p2q2(p4 −2p2q2 + q4) = 4p2q2(p4 + 2p2q2 + q4) −16p4q4,
so we may set
s = 2pq(p2 + q2), K = 2pq.
Fermat investigated this in the case when A is required to be a square, say m2,
and was led to look for integer solutions to x4 +y4 = a square. He then showed that
1 More precisely, a theorem of Tunnell (1983), allows one to determine all integers that are the areas
of right-angled triangles with rational sides—the so-called triangular numbers—but the theorem
assumes the truth of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. See, among other good sources

2.2
Fermat’s Proof of the Theorem in the Case n = 4
17
there is no solution in integers to the equation x4 + y4 = a square, which implies
that there are no integer solutions to x4 + y4 = a fourth power.
Let us look at Fermat’s argument, and a helpful commentary on it by André Weil.
Fermat’s Last Theorem: The Case of x4 + y4 = z4
“Bachet: Find a triangle whose area is a given number.” The area of a triangle in numbers
cannot be a square. I am going to give a proof of this theorem, which I have discovered; and
I did not ﬁnd it without painful and laborious thinking about it, but this kind of proof will
lead to marvellous progress in the science of numbers.2
If the area of a triangle was a square there would be two fourth powers whose difference was
a square; it would follow equally that there would be two squares whose sum and difference
would be squares. Consequently there would be a square number, the sum of a square and
the double of a square, with the property that the sum of the two squares that make it up is
likewise a square. But if a square number is the sum of a square and the double of a square
its root is likewise the sum of a square and the double of a square, which I can prove without
difﬁculty. One concludes from this that this root is the sum of the two sides of a right angle
in a triangle of which one of the square components forms the base and the double of the
other square the height.
The triangle will therefore be formed of two square numbers whose sums and differences
are squares. But one will prove that the sum of these two squares is smaller than the ﬁrst
two of which one has likewise supposed that the sum and difference are squares. Therefore,
if one has two squares whose sum and difference are squares one has at the same time, in
integers, two squares enjoying the same property whose sum is less.
By the same reasoning, one has accordingly another sum smaller than that derived from the
ﬁrst, and continuing indeﬁnitely one will always ﬁnd smaller and smaller integers satisfying
the same condition. But this is impossible because an integer being given there cannot be
an inﬁnity of integers which are smaller.
The margin is too narrow to receive the complete proof with all its developments.
In the same way I have discovered and proved that there cannot be a triangular number,
except for one, which is also a fourth power.3
To follow this we are helped by a commentary by André Weil (1984, 77):
Fortunately, just for once, he had found room for this mystery in the margin of the very last
proposition of Diophantus [. . . ]; this is how it goes.
Take a Pythagorean triangle whose sides may be assumed mutually prime; then they can be
written as (2pq, p2 −q2, p2 +q2) where p, q are mutually prime, p > q, and p−q is odd.
Its area is pq(p+q)(p−q), where each factor is prime to the other three; if this is a square,
all the factors must be squares. Write p = x2, q = y2, p + q = u2, p −q = v2, where u, v
must be odd and mutually prime. Then x, y, and z = uv are a solution of x4 −y4 = z2;
incidentally, v2, x2, u2 are then three squares in an arithmetic progression whose difference
is y2. We have u2 = v2 + 2y2; writing this as 2y2 = (u + v)(u −v), and observing that
the g.c.d. of u + v and u −v is 2, we see that one of them must be of the form 2r2 and the
other of the form 4s2, so that we can write u = r2 + 2s2, ±v = r2 −2s2, y = 2rs, and

Fermat’s Last Theorem
consequently
x2 = 1
2(u2 + v2) = r4 + 4s4.
Thus r2, 2s2 and x are the sides of a Pythagorean triangle whose area is (rs)2 and whose
hypotenuse [x, JJG] is smaller than the hypotenuse x4 + y4 of the original triangle. This
completes the proof “by descent”.
2.3
Euler and x3 + y3 = z3
Mathematicians seem to have enjoyed discovering that the search for proofs in
number theory took them from one problem to another, and Euler at work on the
case of Fermat’s ‘last’ theorem when n = 3 is a good illustration of that process at
work. Euler ﬁrst claimed to have proved this result in a letter to Goldbach of August
1753 (see Euler 2015, letter 169), but he did not publish his work until his Algebra
appeared in 1770. His proof is given in Chapter XV, §243, and it is a rather long,
so I can only sketch it here. He modelled his study of this problem on Fermat’s
own published solution of the case n = 4, suspecting that the problems must be
analogous, and Fermat had shown that there were no whole number solutions in
that case by his ingenious method of inﬁnite descent.
Euler began with a preliminary simpliﬁcation of the problem. From the equation
x3 + y3 = z3 it is clear that not all the numbers x, y, and z can be even, or they
would have a common factor, and we can assume without loss of generality that they
do not. Nor can they all be odd, because the sum of two odd numbers is even. So
either x is even or z is even, and Euler assumed z is even—the other case proceeds
similarly. So he deduced that x + y = 2p, say, and x −y = 2q, say (this is not
saying that p and q are primes). It follows that x3 + y3 = 2p(p2 + 3q2). Here is
the connection to another problem: the quadratic form p2 + 3q2.
Therefore, said Euler, 2p and p2 + 3q2 are both cubes.4 The only way this fails
is if p is a multiple of 3, because this is the only way that 2p and p2 + 3q2 are not
coprime.5
Euler then ﬁxed his attention on how a number of the form p2 + 3q2 can be a
cube.6 There is the identity
(a2 + 3b2)3 = (a3 −9ab2)2 + 3(3a2b −3b3)2,
4Notice, with Euler, that because 2p is to be a cube it must be of the form 8p′3.
5I omit this case, because it proceeds similarly to the case we shall discuss. Here z3 = 9r
4 (3r2+q2),
so Euler could write q = t(t2−9u2) and r = 3u(t2−u2) with u even and t odd, and obtain another
inﬁnite descent. See also Edwards Fermat’s Last Theorem, p. 42, because it is another argument
upon which no signiﬁcant historical point depends.

Euler and x3 + y3 = z3

which says that a cube of a number of the form p2 + 3q2 is itself of that form.
Conversely, Euler now asserted that if a number of the form p2 +3q2 is a cube, then
it is a cube of a number of that form; that is, there are integers a and b such that
(a2 + 3b2)3 = p2 + 3q2.
Indeed, he said, if p + q
√
−3 = (a + b
√
−3)3 and p −q
√
−3 = (a −b
√
−3)3
then p2 + 3q2 = (a2 + 3b2)3, which is a cube, and
p = a3 −9ab2, and q = 3a2b −3b3.
Now comes the descent step. The numbers 2a, a −3b, and a + 3b are relatively
prime (if they were not p and q would not be) and are cubes (because their product,
2p is a cube, and obviously a−3b+a+3b = 2a). So the descent can begin, and the
contradiction is immediate. Fermat’s Last Theorem follows in the case n = 3—or
it would if one dubious step could be made secure: the existence of the integers a
and b.
On what grounds did Euler make the claim that the cube root of a number of the
form p2 + 3q2 is of that form? He factorised p2 + 3q2 = (p +
√
−3q)(p −
√
−3q)
and claimed that if p±
√
−3q is a cube it is cube of a number of the form a±
√
−3b.
Now this is true, as it turns out, but not for the reasons Euler gave. Earlier in his
Algebra (1770, Part II, Chapter XII, §182) he had considered the general question:
when is x2+cy2 a square? He factorised to get x2+cy2 = (x +√−cy)(x −√−cy)
and treated each factor as if it were an integer7:
Let, therefore, the formula x2+cy2 be proposed, and let it be required to make it a square. As
it is composed of the factors (x+√−cy)×(x−√−cy), these factors must either be squares,
or squares multiplied by the same number. For, if the product of two numbers, for example,
pq, must be a square, we must have p = r2 and q = s2, that is to say, each factor is of itself
a square; or p = mr2, and q = ms2; and therefore these factors are squares multiplied both
by the same number. For which reason, let us make x + y√−c = m(p + q√−c); it will
follow that x −y√−c = m(p −y√−c); and we shall have x2 + cy2 = m(p2 + cq2),
which is a square.
This is interesting, partly because it is wrong, but partly because it is audacious.
Unhappily Euler’s argument here is false; it is perfectly correct for ordinary
whole numbers, but not—in general—for numbers of the form x + y√−c.
Nevertheless his claim is true in the cases c = 2 and c = 3, although it is not
for c = 5, because the factors of 21 = 42 + 5 · 1 are 3 and 7, neither of which is
of the right form. This is the important difference between x2 + 3y2 and x2 + 5y2,
which Euler was unable to explain.
The problem of divisors and prime factors for these numbers runs very deep.
Consider 19 = 42 + 3 · 12 = a2 + 3b2 with a = 4, b = 1. Observe that 19 = (4 +
√
−3)(4 −
√
−3) and deduce that if the concept of prime makes sense for numbers
of the form m + n
√
−3 then intuitively 19 is not prime among such numbers.
7Euler, Elements of Algebra, p. 396.

Fermat’s Last Theorem
Now, in ordinary arithmetic prime divisors have this property: if p is prime and
divides a product mn then either p divides m or p divides n. We want to extend this
concept to numbers of the form m + n
√
−3. Certainly we can add, subtract and
multiply such numbers together and show that the results are numbers of this form.
However, we cannot always divide one number of this form by another and express
the answer in this form, so the concept of one of these numbers being a divisor of
another becomes interesting.
A fault is a fault. The more important point, however, is that Euler extended
reasoning about integer numbers to new numbers of the form x + y√−c. At a
time when imaginary quantities were still a source of controversy in mathematics,
here Euler boldly proposed to discuss prime, relatively prime, square and cube
numbers of this kind, treating them as if they were integers, and hence that concepts
such as ‘prime’ would similarly apply. Moreover, the relevance of these ideas to
the problem is only apparent once we have seen deeply into the problem—why
might they not be red-herrings? In fact, to later mathematicians such as Lagrange,
Legendre, and Gauss, the theory of ‘integers’ of this form was to be the way forward
in number theory. It is this combination of deep intuitive perceptiveness, going for
the signiﬁcance of numbers of a certain form, while making elementary errors in
the logic of proof that provides an illustration of Euler’s amazing ability to take the
‘right’ risks.
A charming indication of how Euler viewed his work, his aims and his partial
successes, can be gleaned from a letter he wrote to Goldbach on 4 August 1753 on
his success with x3 + y3 = z3.8
There’s another very lovely theorem in Fermat whose proof he says he has found. Namely,
on being prompted by the problem in Diophantus, ﬁnd two squares whose sum is a square,
he says that it is impossible to ﬁnd two cubes whose sum is a cube, and two fourth powers
whose sum is a fourth power, and more generally that this formula an + bn = cn is
impossible when n > 2. Now I have found valid proofs that a3 +b3 ̸= c3 and a4 +b4 ̸= c4,
where ̸= denotes cannot equal. But the proofs in the two cases are so different from
one another that I do not see any possibility of deriving a general proof from them that
an + bn = cn if n > 2. Yet one sees quite clearly as if through a trellice that the larger n
is, the more impossible the formula must be. Meanwhile I haven’t yet been able to prove
that the sum of two ﬁfth powers cannot be a ﬁfth power. To all appearances the proof just
depends on a brainwave, and until one has it all one’s thinking might as well be in vain. But
since the equation aa + bb = cc is possible, and so also is this possible, a3 + b3 + c3 = d3,
it seems to follow that this, a4 + b4 + c4 + d4 = e4, is possible, but up till now I have
been able to ﬁnd no case of it. But there can be ﬁve speciﬁed fourth powers whose sum is a
fourth power.
It is clear from this that he was dissatisﬁed. Although he had found a proof,
indeed one by inﬁnite descent, it seemed to him that he would not be able to solve
in this way the general case (that of xn + yn = zn for any n > 2) so we see that he
had both a speciﬁc and a general aim in mind.

are sums of only three fourth powers see the Wikipedia entry ‘Euler’s sum of powers conjecture’.

Introduction
It was Lagrange who sought to produce a general theory of quadratic forms, after
Euler had published a number of deep and provocative studies of many examples—
what would today be called ‘experimental mathematics’. Here we look at one key
idea in his treatment: the reduction of forms to simpler but equivalent ones. We
are led to one of the great theorems in mathematics: quadratic reciprocity. It was
conjectured well before it was proved for the ﬁrst time, as we shall see later.
Cox’s book is a very good guide to this material, as is Scharlau and Opolka
From Fermat to Minkowski, which is a historically-based introduction to all of this
material on number theory and more; Chapter III on Lagrange is very helpful.1
3.2
The Beginnings of a General Theory of Quadratic Forms
There comes a point where the interest of a mathematician requires a suitable
generality. Some might believe that writing a number as a sum of squares is
interesting (the Pythagorean theorem and all that) and ﬁnd the question of what
numbers are of the form x2 + 2y2 simply contrived. But even if we ﬁnd that
question congenial, we cannot really imagine anyone being equally interested in
all the subsequent cases: x2 +3y2, x2 +5y2, x2 +6y2 and so on. At some point, the
question would arise: is there not, perhaps, a uniform theory about numbers of the
form x2 + ny2 for all non-square integers n. We have already seen that this will be
a vain hope if a very simple theory is wanted, because the theory of x2 + 5y2 seems
very different from its predecessors.

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
It was Lagrange who spotted the reason for this, and so initiated the number
theory of quadratic forms. He observed that there is a quadratic form that deserves
to be counted alongside x2 + 5y2; it is
2x2 + 2xy + 3y2,
which shares with x2 + 5y2 the property that, writing them both in the form ax2 +
bxy + cy2 the discriminant, 4ac −b2 is the same—it is 20 in each case.
Once we decide to broaden the subject and admit all binary quadratic forms
(i.e. forms in x and y only), it is helpful to note a simple piece of geometry. The
corresponding curves may be ellipses or hyperbolas—for example, x2 + 5y2 = n
deﬁnes an ellipse for each positive integer n—and it is clear that the question of
whether there are any integers x and y satisfying, say, x2 + 5y2 = 27 is a ﬁnite one
because the ellipse occupies only a ﬁnite region of the (x, y)-plane. But the same
question about x2 −5y2 = 27 will be much harder, because the hyperbola goes
off to inﬁnity in the (x, y)-plane.2 And indeed, we have every reason to expect that
there are inﬁnitely many solutions to x2 −5y2 = 1. We shall see that Lagrange’s
theory works much more easily for quadratic forms with positive discriminants than
negative ones, in line with this geometric observation.
We also note that the forms ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 with D = ac −b2 > 0 can be
written this way:
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = (1/a)((ax + by)2 + Dy2).
This may not be a quadratic form with integer coefﬁcients, but it is a sum of squares
so it takes positive values exclusively if a > 0 and negative values exclusively if
a < 0. We say that a form is positive if it takes only positive values (and negative
if it takes only negative values), so a form with positive discriminant ac −b2 is
positive if and only if a > 0.
Now we ﬁx some notation. We shall think of
 x
y

as a column vector, x. A
symmetric 2 by 2 matrix with integer entries will be written A, so a quadratic form
can and will be written as
xT Ax.
Note, however, that this was not Lagrange’s notation but a much more modern one.
2This question is solved by working modulo 5.

3.2
Beginnings

We have done this so we can follow Lagrange’s analysis more easily. Let P be a
2 by 2 matrix, not necessarily symmetric, with integer entries and determinant ±1,
so its inverse also has integer entries. We can think of it as a change of basis matrix
in R2 with the property that points with integer coordinates are mapped to points
with integer coordinates, or even in some sense as a change of basis matrix in Z2.
Evidently if (x, y) is a pair of integers such that xT Ax = 27, say, then P −1x is a
pair of integers such that xT P −1T P T APP −1x = 27. In other words, the integers
represented by A and P T AP are the same: Lagrange regarded the corresponding
quadratic form s as equivalent. Notice that the transformations we are using do not
change the value of the determinant, det(P T AP) = det A · (det P)2 = det A, so
matrices with different determinants cannot be equivalent.
Here enter two irritating but unavoidable little deﬁnitional questions. Should we
insist that a quadratic form be written ax2 + bxy + cy2 or ax2 + 2bxy + cy2? If we
go with the former, the corresponding matrix form acquires a half-integer when b
is odd; should we go with the latter we have to remember to let b be a half-integer.
Lagrange began by taking the former route and used ax2 + bxy + cy2 but then
switched; Gauss took the latter route and wrote ax2 + 2bxy + cy2. Likewise, is the
central invariant the determinant, or indeed 4 times the determinant: 4(ac−b2/4) =
4ac−b2, or its negative, b2−4ac, with the familiar ring of school algebra? Lagrange
decided that the invariant associated to ax2 +bxy +cy2 is 4ac −b2 = D and called
it the discriminant. The name makes sense—it discriminates—and it is plus 4 times
the determinant. The mathematically easy case is the one with positive discriminant.
Gauss, just to confuse matters, worked with ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 and what he called
the determinant: b2 −ac, which is, of course, the negative of what we would call
the determinant.
Lagrange searched for a set of canonical representatives of each equivalence
class.3 He found that there were simple linear changes of variable, such as we would
represent by a matrix P of determinant ±1, which could drive down the size of the
coefﬁcient of the xy term. If we follow this using transformations of determinant 1
only, we ﬁnd using
S =
 1 −1
0 1

and R =
 0 1
−1 0

that, if A =
a b
b c

then conjugating by S and R gives these results:
ST AS =

a
b −a
b −a a −2b + c

and RT AR =

.
3His method is set out in the later sections of his Additions, and again in his Recherches
d’arithmétique (1773).

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
At least heuristically, the switch R can be used to ensure that the xy coefﬁcient, 2b
is positive and a ≤c, while S reduces b to b −c (if we assume that c is positive, as
we may).
The 2 by 2 matrix with integer entries and determinant 1 form a group, denoted
SL(2, Z), which it turns out is generated by S1 and S2, and thus motivated, one can
prove, as Lagrange did, the following theorem.
Theorem. Lagrange’s reduction theorem for positive forms. Any 2 by 2 symmetric
matrix with integer entries that represents a positive form is equivalent to one of the
form
a b
b c

with
−a
2 < b ≤a
2 and a < c,
or
0 ≤b ≤a
2 and a = c.
Such a matrix will be called the canonical form for the corresponding quadratic
form. Moreover, if the determinant Δ = ac−b2 is positive, any two matrices meeting
these requirements are inequivalent.
The proofs of both of these results are omitted, but will be found in (Scharlau and
Opolka 1984, 36–38). Lagrange gave the existence part early on in his Recherches,
but the uniqueness for forms with a positive determinant only later.4 Note that these
equivalence classes are the classes for proper equivalence, a concept introduced by
Gauss later.
For forms with positive discriminant, it is conventional to look only at positive
forms, and to include the negative ones by default. They are obtained by multiplying
all the coefﬁcients by −1.

ﬁrst, and then by R, and so on) reduces the quadratic form 15x2 + 50xy + 42y2

Lagrange’s theorem immediately imply that

or

so there are only ﬁnitely many equivalence classes for each value of Δ. Indeed,
when Δ = 1 the only possible values for a, b, c are 1, 0, 1 respectively, and when
Δ = 2 the only possible values for a, b, c are 1, 0, 2 respectively. This means that
essentially the only quadratic forms with those discriminants are the ones we have
met: x2+y2 and x2+2y2. So, for example, we know everything about the quadratic
form

, because its discriminant b2 −4ac is −4, and so the number theory
of 89x2 + 110xy + 34y2 and x2 + y2 is essentially the same.
When Δ = 3 it might seem that a new form appears: in addition to x2 + 3y2
there is 2x2 + 2xy + 2y2; all the integers represented by the second of these are, of
course, even. They are not the even numbers represented by x2 + 3y2. But we may
reasonably feel that 2x2+2xy+2y2 is not a new quadratic form: its coefﬁcients have
a common multiple, and it is a disguised version of x2 + xy + y2. The theory that
Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss created only considers primitive quadratic forms,
those for which the highest common factor of the coefﬁcients is 1, so the only
primitive quadratic form with Δ = 3 is x2 + 3y2, and the form x2 + xy + y2
is excluded because its middle coefﬁcient is not even.
When Δ = 5 a new form does appear: in addition to x2 + 5y2 there is 2x2 +
2xy + 3y2—and it is primitive. While the useful identity gives us the result that if
m and n are integers represented by x2 + 5y2 then so is their product, mn, Fermat
observed that there are primes such as 3, 7, and 23 whose pairwise products can also
be represented by x2 + 5y2. Now we can see that these primes are represented by
2x2 +2xy +3y2: respectively (x, y) = (0, 1), (1, 1), and both (1, −3) and (2, −3).
In fact, Euler had already conjectured that primes (other than 5) dividing x2 + 5y2
are congruent to 1, 3, 7, 9 mod 20, and that
p = x2 + 5y2 ⇔p ≡1, 9 mod 20,
2p = x2 + 5y2 ⇔p ≡3, 7 mod 20.
Lagrange was particularly interested in the divisors of numbers represented by
a given quadratic form. Indeed, his paper opens with a result that may be called a
switching theorem. Note that it is a switch of attention in this sense as well, away
from asking “What numbers does a given form represent?” to asking the converse:
“What forms represent a given number?”

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
Theorem. Lagrange’s switching theorem: If an integer m divides a number repre-
sented by a quadratic form Q, then m can be properly represented by a quadratic
form Q′ with the same discriminant.
Proof. The proof is no more than school algebra. We suppose (reverting to the case
where the middle coefﬁcient may be odd!) that
rs = ax2 + bxy + cy2,
with x and y coprime. Suppose s = tu, y = tv and u and v are coprime. Then
rtu = ax2 + bxtv + ct2v2.
Since t divides y and x and y are coprime t cannot divide x, so t divides a; say
a = et. So
ru = ex2 + bxv + ctv2.
We may write x = αu + βv where α and β are integers, because u and v are
coprime, so
ru = e(αu + βv)2 + b(αu + βv)v + ct2v2
= eα2u2 + (2eβ + b)αuv + (eβ2 + bβ + ct)v2.
Since u and v are coprime, u must divide eβ2 + bβ + ct. Set
A = eu, B = 2eβ + b, C = eβ2 + bβ + ct
u
,
and
α = X, v = Y,
and dividing by u gives
r = AX2 + BXY + CY 2.
A simple calculation conﬁrms that B2 −4AC = b2 −4ac, and Lagrange’s theorem
is proved.
In fact, Lagrange went even further. To say what he did I introduce some notation:
if a quadratic form (a, b, c) represents an integer m, that is, if there are integers x and
y such that ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = m, then I shall sometimes denote this by Q →m.
What Lagrange showed was that if Q →m1m2 then there are quadratic form s Q1
and Q2 such that Q1 →m1 and Q2 →m2 and D(Q1) = D(Q2) = D(Q).

3.2
Beginnings
29
In fact, if Q = ax2 +2bxy +cy2 and Q →m1 and Q →m2, then u2 −Dv2 →
m1m2. For example, if Q = (2, 1, 3) = 2x2 + 2xy + 3y2, so D = −5, then Q →3
and Q →7 and u2 −(−5)v2 →21.
This suggests that given two quadratic form s Q1 and Q2 of the same discrim-
inant D such that Q1 →m1 and Q2 →m2 then there ought to be a quadratic
form Q such that Q →m1m2. We shall see that Legendre was to come up with a
deﬁnition of such a composite, but it had unsatisfactory properties: in particular the
composite was not necessarily unique.
The next seemingly harmless result is actually crucial.
Lemma 3.1. Let m and D be relatively prime, and m be odd, then m is properly
represented by a primitive form of discriminant D only if D is a square mod m.
The term ‘properly represented’ means that the relevant x and y are relatively
prime.
Proof.
4a(ax2 + 2bxy + cy2) = 4(ax + by)2 −Dy2,
where D = −4(ac −b2), so if x and y are such that ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = m then
we have
4am ≡4(ax + by)2 −Dy2,
so mod m we have
4(ax + by)2 −Dy2 ≡0 mod m,
which says that D is a square mod m provided that m is odd.
The lemma implies the corollary that if n is an integer and p an odd prime not
dividing n then −n is a square mod p only if p is represented by a primitive form
of discriminant −4n. This is because x2 + ny2 can represent p only if −4n, and
therefore −n, is a square modulo p. Therefore, if p fails this test there is no hope
of a representation; however, when it passes the test there is uncertainty because
the test gives necessary but not sufﬁcient conditions whenever there is more than
one inequivalent form with that discriminant—which is why n = 5 is much harder
than n = 1, 2, 3.
There are signiﬁcant elementary consequences of reduction theory. The fact that
all binary quadratic forms with discriminant 1 are equivalent means that a number
of the form a = b2c, where c is square-free, is a sum of two squares if and only if
the prime factors of c are either 2 or of the form 4n+1. For, certainly if c is as given
we know it is a sum of squares. Conversely, if a is a sum of squares (which we may
assume are relatively prime) and p is a prime factor of c, then p is a factor of a sum
of two squares, so by Lagrange’s theorem it can be properly represented by a form

30
3
Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
with the same discriminant. But up to equivalence there is only one such form (the
discriminant being 1), so p is properly represented by x2+y2 and is therefore either
2 or of the form 4n + 1.
A very similar argument, also due to Lagrange, shows that primes of the form
8n + 3 can be represented by numbers of the form x2 + 2y2. He also showed that
those of the form 12n + 7 can be represented by x2 + 3y2 (because they cannot be
represented by the alternative, −x2 + 3y2), and that those of the form 24n + 7 can
be represented by x2 + 6y2 (because they cannot be represented by the alternative,
2x2 + 3y2).
On the other hand, there are two inequivalent forms with discriminant 5, which
explains why a similar argument about x2 + 5y2 fails. What can be said, as Euler
knew, is that for p an odd prime greater than 5
p = x2 + 5y2 ⇔p ≡1, 9 mod 20
and
2p = x2 + 5y2 ⇔p ≡3, 7 mod 20.
However, as Euler also knew, the two inequivalent forms x2+14y2 and 2x2+7y2
both represent odd primes other than 7 that are congruent to one of 1, 9, 15, 23, 25,
or 39 mod 56. As Cox (1989, 19) remarks, there are no simple congruence tests
for these primes that will distinguish between these quadratic forms, and quite a bit
of number theory from Gauss onwards is concerned with understanding why and
devising alternatives.
Positive Discriminants
The same matrix analysis reduces quadratic forms with positive discriminants to
canonical form and shows that for each ﬁxed value of the discriminant there are
only ﬁnitely many equivalence classes. The canonical forms are those for which
|a| ≤|c|,
2|b| ≤a,
and these conditions imply that ac < 0 so conventionally one takes a > 0, c < 0.
Moreover:
ac < b2 ≤|Δ|
5 ,
from which it follows that there are only ﬁnitely many equivalence classes for each
value of Δ.

The Theorem of Quadratic Reciprocity

The ﬁrst serious problem that occurs with positive discriminant is that the
reduced forms are not necessarily inequivalent. To give a trivial example,
1 0

and
 −1 0

are equivalent, but both are reduced. Reduction theory is easier in the
negative case.
3.3
The Theorem of Quadratic Reciprocity
This theorem is one of the most important in the subject. When Gauss found his
second proof of it he referred to it in his diary (27 June 1796) as the ‘golden
theorem’. Here I state the theorem, hint at its importance, and indicate some of
the earlier work on it.
Consider the general quadratic form ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 and suppose it represents
the integer N, so there are integers x and y such that
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = N.
By Lemma 3.1, for N to be represented by some quadratic form of discriminant
4(b2 −ac) it is necessary that the discriminant be a square modulo N. Since 4 is a
square, this condition reduces to b2 −ac being a square modulo N, so a necessary
condition for this representation to hold is that the discriminant, b2 −ac, is a square
mod N.
This puts ﬁrmly onto the agenda the question: when is one number a square
modulo another number? That is the question that the theorem of quadratic
reciprocity indirectly answers. It is usually stated using what is called the Legendre
symbol:
 a
p

=
⎧
⎨
⎩
0 p | a
1 p ∤a
∃x : x2 ≡a mod p
−1 p ∤a
̸ ∃x : x2 ≡a mod p
Of the interesting cases (i.e. when p ∤a) we say that a is a quadratic residue
mod p when there is an x such that x2 ≡a mod p, and that a is a not a quadratic
residue mod p when there is no x such that x2 ≡a mod p. If we look back at the
results so far we can see that we have so far been investigating the primes p such
that −1, −2, −3 are quadratic residues mod p.
Now the theorem itself. It comes in three parts. The ﬁrst part says: let p be an
odd prime, then
−1
p

= 1 if and only if p = 4n + 1.

32

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
We know this from the study of primes of the form x2 + y2.
The second part says let p be an odd prime, then
 2
p

= 1 if and only if p = 8n ± 1.
We may conjecture this by looking at primes of the form x2 −2y2.
The third and largest part concerns two odd primes, p and q, and it says that
p
q

=
 q
p

(−1)
p−1
2
q−1
2 .
More memorably, and more usefully, it says that
p
q

=
 q
p

unless both p and q are primes of the form 4n −1, in which case
p
q

= −
q

.
Notice that this doesn’t answer the question “Is q a prime mod p?”, it merely relates
it to the reciprocal claim: “Is p a prime mod q?”—whence the name of the theorem:
quadratic reciprocity.
Put this together with the observation that
ab
p

=
 a
p
  b


—in modern terms that the Legendre symbol is a homomorphism from Z to Z/2Z,
(see the proof below—Gauss proved it in §98 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae)
and we have a powerful tool. Consider for example the question: is 365 a square
mod 1847? The number 1847 is prime, and we have

So we are done once we know the value of

, which is 1 by the second part
of the quadratic reciprocity theorem, and so 365 is a square mod 1847. Notice that
this does not give us either of the square roots.
The proof that the Legendre symbol is a homomorphism from Z to Z/2Z goes
like this. It is clear that if a and b are squares mod p then so is their product, and
if a is a square but b is not mod p then their product cannot be. For a ≡x2, ab ≡
y2 mod p implies b ≡y2
x2 (mod) p. This leaves the case where neither a nor b is a
square mod p and we need to show that ab is a square. It is clear that the set {ax2}
is the set of non-squares mod p, and so is the set {by2}, as x and y run through the
non-zero integers mod p. This means that if we pick x at random there is a y such
that ax2 ≡by2 ≡c mod p, and so ax2by2 ≡c2 mod p, and so ab ≡
c2
x2y2 mod p.
This shows that ab is a square mod p.
Given the importance of quadratic reciprocity, it is not surprising that people
tried to prove it, but this proved to be hard. Famously, Legendre made a major
mistake here, and the ﬁrst proof is due to Gauss in 1801. Gauss went on to publish
a total of six proofs (two more were left unpublished). Since than people have
given many more—a ﬁgure of a hundred and ﬁfty is sometimes mentioned—not
that there are 150 different ways to prove it, but there are several and this alone
is interesting: apparently this theorem is connected underneath with many other
parts of mathematics. Also, fortunately, although the ﬁrst proof was hard to ﬁnd
and is famously difﬁcult, some of the later proofs are easy, and we will content
ourselves with one of them. Meanwhile, as historians we are as interested in failures
as successes, so we shall look at Legendre’s account, guided here by André Weil.
First however, I note that Legendre did validly establish this important result,
which he then used in his attempts on quadratic reciprocity: If a, b, c are three
integers, not all of the same sign, and such that abc is square free, then the equation
ax2 + by2 + cz2 = 0 has a solution in integers (not all 0) if and only if −bc
is a quadratic residue mod |a|, −ca is a quadratic residue mod |b|, and −ab is a
quadratic residue mod |c|. I omit the proof of this result, which is not trivial.
I turn now to Weil’s commentary (Weil 1984, pp. 328–330).
What Legendre does is to distinguish eight cases according to the values of p and of q
modulo 4 and to the value of (p/q); this same arrangement was observed by Gauss in his
ﬁrst proof of the law in question (Disq §136). In each of these cases, Legendre introduces
an appropriate equation of the form
ax2 + by2 + cz2 = 0
with a ≡b ≡c ≡1 (mod 4); this can have no non-trivial solution, since the congruence
ax2 + by2 + cz2 = 0 (mod 4)
has none. Therefore, by Legendre’s criterion, −bc, −ca and −ab cannot simultaneously
be quadratic residues modulo |a|, modulo |b| and modulo |c|, respectively. In each case
Legendre tries to choose a, b, c so that this will lead to the desired conclusion.
Take ﬁrstly p ≡1, q ≡−1 (mod 4), (p/q) = −1, and the equation x2 + py2 −qz2 = 0;
as (−1/q) = −1, we have (−p/q) = 1; therefore (q/p) cannot be 1; it must be −1, as

34

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
required by the reciprocity law. The same reasoning applies to the case q ≡−q′ ≡−1
(mod 4), (q/q′) = 1, and to the equation x2 −qy2 −q′z2 = 0.
Now take q ≡q′ ≡−1 (mod 4), (q/q′) = −1. In that case Legendre introduces the
equation px2 −qy2 −q′z2 = 0, where p is an auxiliary prime subject to the conditions
p ≡1 mod 4,
p
q

= −1,
 p
q′

= −1.
Assuming that there is such a prime, and using what has been proved before, the conclusion
(q′/q) = 1 follows. For this to be valid, there has to be a prime in one of the arithmetic
progressions
{4qq′x + m | x = 0, 1, 2, . . .}
where one takes for m all the integers > 0 and < 4qq′ which are ≡1 (mod 4) and non-
residues modulo q and modulo q′. Legendre was rightly convinced that every arithmetic
progression {ax + b}, with a prime to b, contains inﬁnitely many primes. “Perhaps it would
be necessary to prove this rigorously”, he had written in 1785 (Recherches, p. 552). “We
need have no doubt about it”, he wrote in 1798 (Essai, p. 220) this time attempting to
support his statement by an altogether unconvincing argument (Essai, pp. 12–16) which he
later expanded, even more disastrously, into a whole chapter of his Théorie des Nombres
(t. II, §XI, pp. 86–104). It was left for Dirichlet to prove the theorem of the arithmetic
progression, as he did in 1837 by a wholly original method (Dir.I. 315–342) which remains
as one of his major achievements; by the same method he also proved (Dir.I. 499–502) that
every quadratic form ax2 + bxy + cy2 represents inﬁnitely many primes provided a, b, c
have no common divisor, as had been announced by Legendre (Théorie des Nombres, t. II,
pp. 102–103).
In the case we have just discussed, the theorem of the arithmetic progression, taken by
Legendre as a kind of axiom, gave at least some semblance of justiﬁcation to his argument;
but there is worse to come. Take the case of two primes p, p′, both ≡1 (mod 4). Legendre
seeks to treat it by means of the equation px2 + p′y2 −qz2 = 0, where q is an auxiliary
prime satisfying
q ≡−1 mod 4,
 q
p′

= 1
p
q

= −1
or alternatively by means of x2 + py2 −p′qz2 = 0, with q satisfying
q ≡−1 mod 4,
p
q

= −1
(Recherches, pp. 519–520; Essai, pp. 216–217 and 220–221; Théorie des Nombres, t. I,
pp. 233–234). Is there such a prime? Clearly its existence would follow from Dirichlet’s
theorem and the reciprocity law; but it is doubtful (as Gauss pointed out: Disq §297) that it
could be proved otherwise. Thus Legendre’s method of proof ends up unavoidably with a
piece of circular reasoning out of which there seems to be no escape. This did not prevent
him, in a letter of 1827 to Jacobi, from complaining, as bitterly as unjustly, that Gauss
had “claimed for himself” the discovery of the reciprocity law (Jac.I. 398). He must have
realized, however, that Gauss’s criticism of his proof had its validity; in his Théorie des
Nombres of 1830 he chose to be on the safe side by inserting (t. II, pp. 57–64) Gauss’s third
proof (cf. Gau.II. 3–8, 1808), and, for good measure (t. II, pp. 391–393) the ‘cyclotomic’
proof communicated to him by Jacobi at the beginning of their correspondence (Jac.I. 394
(1827).

These three chapters cover the bulk of what I want to say about the situation before
1800; there is also Chap. 8 on the solution of polynomial equations. Even then, there
is one signiﬁcant omission: the so-called fundamental theorem of algebra. This is
the claim that every polynomial with real or complex coefﬁcients has as many real
or complex roots as its degree (counted with multiplicity) or, to state it in a more
eighteenth century fashion: a polynomial (with real coefﬁcients) has as many linear
or quadratic factors as its degree permits. Put this way it belongs to a complicated
story about the acceptance of complex numbers, which I have elected not to tell (for
an account of early work on the fundamental theorem of algebra see Appendix A).5
What have these chapters established? First, that the number theory of binary
quadratic forms was beginning to catch on as a subject as the eighteenth cen-
tury drew to an end. Second, and this is a point of a different kind, the methods
on display were those of classical algebra (changes of variable included) conducted,
perhaps, with some ingenuity. The same is true of the later chapter on polynomial
equations. There were hints that explanations can be found that are not simply
calculations, but with little depth to them. Before we see how all this was to change
in the nineteenth century, it is worth noting that even this mathematics is evidence
for the historian: evidence of how mathematics was done. We shall make use of this
observation repeatedly as the book progresses.
This being a book in the history of mathematics, now is a good time to read the
article on Lagrange in the Complete Dictionary of Scientiﬁc Biography and to tell
yourself a story about how important he was. Did he exert his inﬂuence through his
work, his personality, or his power behind the scenes?

Lagrange’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
An important historical transformation happened in the period from Fermat
to Lagrange, and it is tempting to attribute it to Euler, although there were
many inﬂuences. This is the transition from largely verbal and often geometrical
exposition to predominantly symbolic (or algebraic) accounts. If you look back at
how Fermat presented his insight into his ‘last’ theorem, and how Euler proceeded
you will see the distinction clearly. This raises a difﬁcult question about how
the work of Fermat and others of his time is most adequately to be understood.
What is lost if we simply replace his words with symbols, modernise his symbolic
expressions, and forget his geometrical terminology?
In keeping with the didactic character of this book, let me ask the next questions
explicitly.
Questions
1. As with any question of translation, can we say that Fermat and ourselves are
saying the same thing, which is there beneath the way it was actually expressed,
or should we admit that a web of connections is at least rearranged, and perhaps
something is destroyed? For a thorough discussion of what this might involve one
can consult (Goldstein 1995). We should also note that what counts as algebra,
arithmetic, or geometry is ﬂuid and determined by historical circumstances.
2. Is there a distinction to be drawn between Fermat’s collection of examples and
Lagrange’s theory of numbers, and if so, what is it?

Chapter 4
Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
4.1
Introduction
Carl Friedrich Gauss established himself as a mathematician at the age of 24 with
the publication of his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, which eclipsed all previous
presentations of number theory and became the standard foundation of future
research for a century. At its heart is a massive reworking of the theory of quadratic
forms, so after an overview of the work we concentrate on how this book illuminated
the many puzzling complexities still left after Lagrange’s account. We then turn in
the next chapter to the other major topic in Gauss’s book, cyclotomy, and see how
Gauss came to a special case of Galois theory and, in particular, to the discovery that
the regular 17-sided polygon can be constructed by straight edge and circle alone.

Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
4.2
The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae and Its Importance
To introduce the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae I can do no better than quote from one
of the best books written for many years on the history of mathematics, a full-length
study of the book and its impact, edited and largely written by three of the best
historians of mathematics at work today: Goldstein, Schappacher, and Schwermer’s
The Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.1 In their
introductory essay Goldstein and Schappacher begin by saying (pp. 3–5):
Carl Friedrich Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801 has more than one claim to
glory: the contrast between the importance of the book and the youth of its author; the
innovative concepts, notations, and results presented therein; the length and subtlety of
some of its proofs; and its role in shaping number theory into a distinguished mathematical
discipline.
The awe that it inspired in mathematicians was displayed to the cultured public of
the Moniteur universel ou Gazette national as early as March 21, 1807, when Louis
Poinsot, who would succeed Joseph-Louis Lagrange at the Academy of Sciences 6 years
later, contributed a full page article about the French translation of the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae:
The doctrine of numbers, in spite of [the works of previous mathematicians] has
remained, so to speak, immobile, as if it were to stay for ever the touchstone of their
powers and the measure of their intellectual penetration. This is why a treatise as
profound and as novel as his Arithmetical Investigations heralds M. Gauss as one of
the best mathematical minds in Europe.2
They go on to observe that a long string of declarations left by readers of the book, from
Niels Henrik Abel to Hermann Minkowski, from Augustin-Louis Cauchy to Henry Smith,
bears witness to the proﬁt they derived from it. During the nineteenth century, its fame
grew to almost mythical dimensions. In 1891, Edouard Lucas referred to the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae as an “imperishable monument [which] unveils the vast expanse and stunning
depth of the human mind”, and in his Berlin lecture course on the concept of number,
Leopold Kronecker called it “the Book of all Books”. In the process, new ways of seeing
the Disquisitiones came to the fore; they ﬁgure for instance in the presentation given by
John Theodore Merz in his celebrated four-volume History of European Thought in the
Nineteenth Century.3
Germany . . . was already an important power in the Republic of exact science which
then had its centre in Paris. Just at the beginning of the nineteenth century two
events happened which foreboded for the highest branches of the mathematical
sciences a revival of the glory which in this department Kepler and Leibniz had
already given to their country. . . . The ﬁrst was the publication of the ‘Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae’ in Latin in 1801. . . . [Gauss] raised this part of mathematics into an
independent science of which the ‘Disquisitiones Arithmeticae’ is the ﬁrst elaborate
and systematic treatise . . . It was . . . through Jacobi, and still more through his
contemporary Lejeune-Dirichlet . . . that the great work of Gauss on the theory of
numbers, which for 20 years had remained sealed with seven seals, was drawn into
1Published by Springer in 2007. In the extracts that follow I have largely removed the original
footnotes.

current mathematical literature . . . The seals were only gradually broken. Lejeune-
Dirichlet did much in this way, others followed, notably Prof. Dedekind, who
published the lectures of Dirichlet and added much of his own.
Gauss’s book (hereafter, we shall often use the abbreviation ‘the D.A.’ to designate it) is now
seen as having created number theory as a systematic discipline in its own right, with the
book, as well as the new discipline, represented as a landmark of German culture. Moreover,
a standard history of the book has been elaborated. It stresses the impenetrability of the
D.A. at the time of its appearance and integrates it into a sweeping narrative, setting out
a continuous unfolding of the book’s content, from Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune-Dirichlet
and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi on.
In this history modern algebraic number theory appears as the natural outgrowth of the
discipline founded by the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Historical studies have accordingly
focused on the emergence of this branch of number theory, in particular on the works
of Dirichlet, Ernst Eduard Kummer, Richard Dedekind, Leopold Kronecker, and on the
speciﬁc thread linking the D.A. to the masterpiece of algebraic number theory, David
Hilbert’s Zahlbericht of 1897. In addition, they have also explored the fate of speciﬁc
theorems or methods of the D.A. which are relevant for number theorists today.
Yet a full understanding of the impact of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, at all levels,
requires more than just a “thicker description” of such milestones; it requires that light
be shed on other patterns of development, other readers, other mathematical uses of the
book—it requires a change in our questionnaire. We need to answer speciﬁc questions,
such as: What happened to the book outside Germany? What were the particularities, if
any, of its reception in Germany? Which parts of it were read and reworked? And when?
Which developments, in which domains, did it stimulate—or hamper? What role did it play
in later attempts to found mathematics on arithmetic?
Such questions suggest narrower foci, which will be adopted in the various chapters
of the present volume. In this ﬁrst part, however, we take advantage of the concrete
nature of our object of inquiry—a book—to draw a general map of its tracks while
sticking closely to the chronology. That is to say, instead of going backwards, seeking
in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae hints and origins of more recent priorities, we will
proceed forwards, following Gauss’s text through time with the objective of surveying and
periodizing afresh its manifold effects.
Fifty pages later, they conclude (pp. 57–58):
To summarize, the role of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in the constitution of number
theory ﬁfty years after its publication was two-fold. On the one hand, the D.A. provided
number theory with the features of its self-organization as an academic discipline. It
shaped what number theory was and ought to be: congruences and forms with integer
coefﬁcients (with their possible generalizations). This image informed advanced textbooks
and helped to structure them, and it would, for an even longer time, structure classiﬁcations
of mathematics. On the other hand, the D.A. had launched an active research ﬁeld, with a
ﬁrm grasp on number theory, algebra and analysis, supported by close and varied readings
of the book. It provided the ﬁeld with technical tools, and a stock of proofs to scrutinize
and adapt. It also provided concrete examples of the very links between different branches
of mathematics that created the ﬁeld, often articulated around richly textured objects and
formulae, such as the cyclotomic equation or Gauss sums. The (meta)stability of the ﬁeld
was not guaranteed by any unicity of purpose or concept (individual mathematicians might
have their own priorities, mix differently the resources available or disregard some of
them), nor by a merging into a larger domain, but by a constant circulation from one
branch to another, a recycling of results and innovations. How certain branches emancipated
themselves, and with which consequences for number theory and for the role of the D.A.,
will be the subject of the next chapter.

Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
These are impressive claims. What was once seen as the book that created
modern algebraic number theory in much the way that a stream ﬂowing out of
Lake Itasca, in Minnesota, turns into the Mississippi river (one just naturally
grows into the other, getting bigger as it goes along) is now seen as structuring
a landscape around it, having no overall guiding plan, and as something individual
mathematicians can buy into. In fact, Goldstein, Schappacher, and Schwermer go on
to argue that the standard history is correct as far as it goes, but it has marginalised
a Missouri’s worth of ideas that ﬂows through complex analysis and the theory of
elliptic functions. In short, and despite the quality of its predecessors, even they
see it as a book that created a new ﬁeld of mathematics and affected, if not indeed
caused, the growth of several neighbouring disciplines within mathematics.
4.3
Modular Arithmetic
In the opening chapters of the books (sections, as Gauss called them) Gauss
established a number of important results that we shall take for granted but which,
taken together, form an impressive introduction to his concern for rigour. He also
introduced the symbol ≡for congruences, remarking in a footnote to the second
paragraph of the book, that “We have adopted this symbol because of the analogy
between equality and congruence. For the same reason Legendre, in the treatise
which we shall often have occasion to cite, used the same sign for equality and
congruence. To avoid ambiguity, we have made a distinction.” Sophie Germain was
perhaps the ﬁrst mathematician to appreciate this novelty, in her work on Fermat’s
Last Theorem, and she wrote to Gauss to say so.4
Here are slightly modernised statements of some of Gauss’s results. Throughout,
p is a prime number that does not divide the integer a.
•
The congruence ax + b ≡c mod p, a ̸≡0 mod p can always be solved. This
amounts to saying that the integers modulo a prime form a ﬁeld; Gauss showed
that all the operations of arithmetic work modulo a prime.
•
Fermat’s (little) theorem: ap−1 ≡1 mod p.
•
A number a is called a primitive root if the least positive power of a such that
an ≡1 mod p is n = p −1. It follows that every number modulo p is a
unique power of a primitive root. Gauss proved (in §55 of the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae) that for each prime p there is at least one primitive root. In much
more modern terms this is a consequence of the more general result that the
multiplicative subgroup of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic. Gauss noted that no-one before
him had proved this result: Lambert had stated it without proof, and Euler’s
attempt at a proof has two gaps. He therefore observed that “This theorem
furnishes an outstanding example of the need for circumspection in number
4See Del Centina and Fiocca (2012, 693).

41
theory so that we do not accept fallacies as certainties” (§56). He went on to
sketch a method for ﬁnding a primitive root in any given case. It will be worth
keeping an eye out for later ramiﬁcations of this result.
As an example of the theorem of the primitive root, in §58 Gauss gave the fact
that every number modulo 19 is a power of 2. It is easier to see that every number
modulo 5 is a power of 2, and every number modulo 7 is a power of 3 (but it is not
the case that every number modulo 7 is a power of 2). The theorem allows us to ﬁnd
which nth roots of a number modulo p are also numbers modulo p.
To ﬁnd a primitive root when p = 19, and then to show that one always exists,
we can proceed as follows. The possible orders of numbers modulo p are 1, 2, 3, 6,
9, and 18. Any number modulo p of order k satisﬁes the equation
xk ≡1 mod 19,
which has at most k roots modulo 19. Therefore there is at most 1 number modulo p
of order 1, at most 2 of order 2, 3 of order 3, 6 of order 6, and 9 of order 9. Elements
of order 2 or 3 also satisfy the equation x6 ≡1 mod 19, and elements of order 3 also
satisfy the equation x9 ≡1 mod 19, so it is enough to count the elements of orders
1, 6, and 9, of which there are at most 16 (and certainly less, in this case). So there
must be an element of order 18, which is therefore a primitive root.
Alternatively, and more generally, we could take the product of an element of
order 6 and one of order 9. It must have an order which is the least common multiple
of these orders, which is 18, and so be a primitive root.
In the general case, Gauss supposed that
p −1 = pα1

So there is nothing to worry about in the claim that primitive roots exist. This
frees us to concentrate on the much more interesting question, which is what use
Gauss went on to make of them—and indeed to contemplate a nice exercise in group
theory well before group theory was created and which very good mathematicians
before him had failed to carry out.

Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
4.4
Gauss on Congruences of the Second Degree
The fourth section of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a preliminary to the more
important ﬁfth section on binary quadratic form s, but it tells us a lot about what
Gauss had been reading and how carefully he read. It also contains the ﬁrst proof of
quadratic reciprocity.
Gauss began with some remarks about composite moduli before isolating the
central task of studying congruences modulo a prime. He deﬁned residues and non-
residues, and in §108 he proved the theorem that −1 is a quadratic residue of all
prime numbers of the form 4n + 1 and a non-residue of all prime numbers of the
form 4n + 3. He gave this proof, which he attributed to Euler (Opuscula Analytica
1, 135); earlier (§64) he had mentioned other proofs due to Euler from 1760 and
173–174.5
Let C be the collection of all non-zero residues mod p that are less than p; C
has 1
2(p −1) members, and this number is even if p is of the form 4n + 1 and odd
otherwise. Call two residues associated if their product is congruent to 1 modulo p.
Let the number of residues that are not equal to their associates be a and those that
do equal their associates be b in number, then C contains a + 2b members, so a is
even when p is of the form 4n + 1 and odd when p is of the form 4n + 3. Now the
only numbers less than p that are associates of themselves are 1 and −1, so −1 is a
quadratic residue if and only if a is even, i.e. if and only if p is of the form 4n + 1.
The proof makes use of the fact, which Gauss had proved earlier, that every
number less than p has an inverse modulo p that is also less than p.
Gauss then turned to the residues +2 and −2. He listed the primes less than 100
for which 2 is a residue: 7, 17, 23, 31, 41, 47, 71, 79, 89, 97. None, he remarked,
are of the form 8n + 3 or 8n + 5, and wrote “Let us see therefore whether this
induction can be made a certitude”. To show that it can be, Gauss considered the
least number t for which 2 is a residue, so there is an a such that a2 ≡2 mod t.
He wrote a2 = 2 + tu and showed (I omit the argument) that u will be smaller than
t. But this contradicts the deﬁnition of t and so Gauss concluded, using the result
above about −1, that 2 is a nonresidue and −2 a residue of all primes of the form
8n + 3 and both 2 and −2 are nonresidues of all primes of the form 8n + 5.
Rather more work was required to obtain the results that 2 is a residue of primes
of the forms 8n + 1 and 8n −1, and that −2 is a residue of primes of the forms
8n + 1 and a nonresidue of primes of the forms 8n −1.
Gauss then dealt with +3 and −3, remarking (§120) that the theorems in this
case were known to Fermat (and stated in a letter to the British mathematicians) but
the ﬁrst proofs were given by Euler in 1760–61, and “This is why it is still more
astonishing that proof of the propositions relative to the residues +2 and −2 kept
eluding him, since they depend on similar devices”.
5The Opuscula Analytica is a two-volume edition of previously unpublished works by Euler that
was published by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1783 and 1785. Most of
the papers are on number theory, including topics related to quadratic reciprocity.

4.5
Gauss’s Theory of Quadratic Forms

Then came the cases of +5 and −5. Inspection of cases (which Gauss called
induction) led him to claim (§123) that +5 is a residue of all prime numbers that are
residues of 5 (which are those of the form 5n + 1, 5n + 4, or 20n ± 1, or 20n ± 9)
and a nonresidue of all odd numbers that are nonresidues of 5. “However”, he said,
“the veriﬁcation of this induction is not so easy”. I omit his demonstration.
All this was the build-up to Gauss’s ﬁrst proof of quadratic reciprocity, but the
proof there is unilluminating, being a case-by-case examination of the different
cases that arise if the theorem is approached head-on. It was described by Smith as
“presented by Gauss in a form very repulsive to any but the most laborious students”,
although an intelligible and much shorter reworking has since been given by Ezra
Brown in (1981).
4.5
Gauss’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
In many ways the core of Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is his theory of
quadratic forms, and explicitly his composition theory for them and his classiﬁcation
of them into various types. His original treatment is long and can seem like on
obscure exercise in classiﬁcation, and to make matters worse his composition is
not easy to carry out (although it can be automated, as later writers worked hard
to show). So the ﬁrst thing to say about it is that it was the ﬁrst theory that
enabled a mathematician to read off from the coefﬁcients a, 2b, c what numbers
can be represented by that form. It is worth keeping an eye out, too, for the word
‘character’, because it is introduced here for the ﬁrst time and it is the origin of the
idea of characters in the representation of groups. All before the group concept had
been thought of!
For Gauss a quadratic form was an expression of the form ax2 + 2bx + cy2. The
quantity D = b2 −ac he called the determinant of the form. Because this is the
negative of the determinant we would want – the one corresponding to the matrix
a b
b c

– it is best to call this the Gaussian determinant, and even the discriminant.
He said that one form F1 implies another F2 if F1 can be transformed into F2 by an
integer linear transformation of non-zero determinant (not necessarily ±1). When
this is the case any number represented by F2 can be represented by F1. In the
notation introduced in the previous chapter, if the quadratic forms F1 and F2 are
represented by symmetric matrices Q1 and Q2 respectively, then to say that F1
implies F2 is to say that there is a transformation represented by a matrix A such
that AT Q1A = Q2.
Gauss distinguished, as his predecessors had not, between equivalence and
strict equivalence of forms: in the ﬁrst case the integer linear transformation has
determinant ±1, in the second, strict, case it has determinant +1. This gave him two
levels of equivalence classes: equivalence and strict equivalence. Gauss called two
forms properly equivalent if the determinant was +1, and improperly equivalent if
the determinant was −1. Gauss also isolated the case when the greatest common

44
4
Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
divisor (gcd) of the coefﬁcients a, b, c is 1 and called the corresponding form
primitive.
He then gave a very detailed analysis of the Lagrange reduction process, showing,
as an example (§175) how to ﬁnd all 8 inequivalent forms with D = −85 (Gauss
found 8 because he included the negative as well as the positive reduced forms,
−ax2−2bxy−cy2 and ax2+2bxy+cy2). He also listed all the positive inequivalent
forms with Gaussian determinant b2 −ac = D ≥−12.
It is harder when the discriminant is positive, and Gauss introduced the concept
of neighbouring forms and periods in order to handle it—this aspect of the theory
will not be discussed. This was because making his theory work in concrete cases
depended heavily on one being able to ﬁnd representatives within each equivalence
class that have the most convenient properties (see §223 for his informal criteria).
Gauss next proceeded to divide up the set of equivalence classes. Two classes
represented by (a, b, c) and (a′, b′, c′) were said to have the same order if and only
if
gcd(a, b, c) = gcd(a′, b′, c′), and gcd(a, 2b, c) = gcd(a′, 2b′, c′).
He noted that all properly primitive classes go in one order and all improperly
primitive classes go in another order (provided, of course, there are forms which
are improperly but not properly equivalent). He further subdivided an order into
distinct sets called the genera (singular genus). His aim here was to deal with the
question raised by Lagrange’s result on switching forms.
After all this (ﬁnally!, you may think) came some number theory. Gauss proved
(§228) that given a properly primitive form F, not necessarily reduced, and a prime
number p there are inﬁnitely many numbers that are represented by F and not
divisible by p.
The proof is simple. Let the form be ax2 + 2bxy + cy2, and p be a prime. Then
p cannot divide all of a, b, and c. If it does not divide a, then whenever x is not
divisible by p and y is divisible by p the quadratic form ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 is not
divisible by p. A similar argument deals with the case when p does not divide c. If
p divides both a and c then it does not divide 2b and so if x and y have values not
divisible by p then ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 is not divisible by p.
Then Gauss showed (§229) that if the prime p divides D then either all of the
numbers that are represented are quadratic residues mod p or none are. The proof
of this result is also not difﬁcult. Let the form F be ax2 + 2bxy + cy2, and suppose
it represents m and m′, say
m = ag2 + 2bgh + ch2 , m′ = ag′2 + 2bg′h′ + ch′2.
Then
mm′ =

agg′ + b(gh′ + g′h) + chh′2 −D(gh′ −g′h)2.

4.5
Gauss’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
45
So mm′ is congruent to a square modulo D and therefore also modulo p, and so m
and m′ are either both residues or both non-residues modulo p, as claimed.
He called this dichotomy a ﬁxed relationship for the primes p that divide D, and
observed that it holds only for primes that divide D, so numbers representable by
F have a ﬁxed relationship to the prime divisors of D. With very little more work,
Gauss deduced this result:
1. if D(F) ≡−1 (4) then the odd numbers represented by F have a ﬁxed
relationship to 4. That is either all odd m represented by F are ≡1 (4) or all
are ≡−1 (4).
2. when 4|D the ﬁxed relationship is: either all odd m represented by F are ≡1 (4)
or all are ≡−1 (4).
3. when 8|D the ﬁxed relationship is that all odd m represented by F fall into one
class: either all are ≡1 (8) or all are ≡3 (8), or all are ≡5 (8) or all are ≡7 (8).
For the ﬁrst of these, Gauss observed in §229 that
When the determinant D of the primitive form F is ≡3 (mod. 4), all odd numbers
representable by the form F will be ≡1, or ≡3 (mod. 4). For if m, m′ are two numbers
representable by F, the product mm′ can be reduced to the form p2 −Dq2, just as we did
above. When each of the numbers m, m′ is odd, one of the numbers p, q is necessarily even,
the other odd, and therefore one of the squares p2, q2 will be ≡0, the other ≡1 (mod. 4).
Thus p2 −Dq2 must certainly be ≡1 (mod. 4), and both m, m′ must be ≡1, or both ≡3
(mod. 4). So, e.g., no odd number other than those of the form 4n + 1 can be represented
by the form (10, 3, 17).
Gauss gave more ﬁxed relationships for D ≡2 (8) and D ≡6 (8)—I quote
them but omit the proofs. The statements become clear on taking examples.
•
When the determinant D of the primitive form F is ≡2 (mod 8); all odd numbers
representable by the form F will be either partly ≡1 and partly ≡7, or partly
≡3 and partly ≡5 (mod 8).
•
When the determinant D of the primitive form F is ≡6 (mod 8); all odd numbers
representable by the form F are either only those that are ≡1 and ≡3 (mod. 8)
or only those that are ≡5 and ≡7 (mod 8) .
Gauss called a ﬁxed relationship (§230) a character of the form F, and the set of
all ﬁxed relationships of a form its total character.6 He pointed out that the characters
of a primitive form ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 are easy to determine from the coefﬁcients a
and c: both are obviously representable by the form but at most one is divisible by
any prime dividing D because b2 = D + ac, else the form would not be primitive.
By way of an example, Gauss exhibited all the positive inequivalent forms
with discriminant −161. As it happens, there are 16 such classes of forms with
discriminant −161, and Gauss showed that they fall into four groups of four on
looking at their characters. These distinct families Gauss called the genera of the
quadratic form. (Linguistic note: ‘genera’ comes from ‘general’, ‘species’ from
6This is the origin of the term ‘character’ in the theory of group representations.

46

Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
‘speciﬁc’, so genera can be broken down into species. The terminology, including
the word ‘order’, is taken from Linnaean biology).
Gauss produced this table (§231) as an example of his results,

Here, each row contains all the inequivalent reduced forms of the same genus.
For example, given the form (10, 3, 17) = 10x2 + 6xy + 17y2, observe that it is
primitive. Form the discriminant, which in this case is 32 −10 × 17 = −161. This
tells us that representable odd numbers will either all be congruent to 1 mod 4 or all
be congruent to 3 mod 4. Factorise the discriminant : −161 = −7 × 23. This tells
us that the ﬁxed relationship with 7 and 23 is crucial.
The way to understand this table, and the method of ﬁxed relations in general,
is to view it as a series of questions asked, in this case, of a form with discriminant
congruent to −1 mod 4 and any odd number m:
•
Is m congruent to 1 mod 4?
•
Is m congruent to a square mod 7?
•
Is m congruent to a square mod 23?
Only if the answers to these questions are all ‘Yes’, or if the answers are one
‘Yes’ and two ‘No’s, can the odd number m be representable by a form of the
corresponding genus.
The deeper implications of this table, and of its proof, rest heavily on Gauss’s
theory of the composition of forms, as we shall see later on. First, Gauss claimed
that exactly half the possible genera occur—those for which there is an even number
of ‘No’s, and second that all the genera occur for which there is an even number of
‘No’s. We shall examine Gauss’s reasons for this later on, but for now notice that
this means that an odd number m is representable by a form of discriminant −161
only if an even number of ‘No’s are returned to the above questions.
Notice, by the way, that there are examples of inequivalent forms in the table of
the form (a, b, c) and (a, −b, c). Such pairs of forms represent the same numbers,
because
(a, b, c)(x, y) = ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = (a, −b, c)(−x, y).
The inequivalent classes in a genus have the same complete character as Gauss
called it, which means that they represent the same numbers modulo D. For
example, Gauss simply stated that the inequivalent reduced forms (2, 1, 81) and
(9, 1, 18) are in the same genus. In fact, they both represent 85, for example, and
give out squares modulo 7 and modulo 23, as does the form (9, −1, 18) but not

(1, 0, 161). But this is not the case for forms in distinct genera. This means that the
question “Is the number n representable by a form of discriminant D?” is partially
answered either by discovering that the answer is no, or by exhibiting the genus of
forms for which it is possible. But in the second (afﬁrmative) case it remains to see
which of the forms in that genus do the trick. It leaves open for further research the
question of how the genera can be told apart—this would, alas, take us too far aﬁeld.
4.6
Exercises
1. Find which of the numbers 5, 9, 13, 17, 25, 29, 33 are representable by a form
of discriminant −161, and when the number is representable determine the form
that represents it.
2. Show that the numbers 101, 103, and 109 are not representable by any form of
discriminant −161 but that the number 107 is representable, and determine the
form that represents 107.
These exercises make clear that if a number is representable by a form of a
given genus it may be represented only by one form of that genus.
3. We shall now see that there are odd numbers that meet Gauss’s necessary
requirements to be representable by a quadratic form but are not representable.
This shows that his criteria are not sufﬁcient.
(a) There are two equivalence classes of forms with discriminant −13: F1 =
(1, 0, 13) and F2 = (2, 1, 7). By Gauss’s analysis, we have two tests to
apply to odd numbers m that might be representable by one of these forms:
is m ≡1 mod 4? and is m congruent to a square modulo 13?
(b) Check that the form F1 = (1, 0, 13) represents odd numbers that answer both
questions with a ‘Yes’ and that the form F2 = (2, 1, 7) represents numbers
that answer both questions with a ‘No’.
(c) Gauss’s criteria say that odd numbers representable by F2 must be congruent
to 3 mod 4 and not squares mod 13, because 7 is plainly representable.
Among the numbers that fulﬁl these criteria are 7, 11, and 15 but while 11 is
representable, 15 cannot be written in the form 2x2 + 2xy + 7y2.

Cyclotomy
5.1
Introduction
In the seventh section of his book, Gauss transformed what had been a branch of
geometry and trigonometry into a branch of arithmetic with profound implications
for algebra that were to inﬂuence Abel and Galois. His discoveries concerning
the pth roots of unity for primes p in this part of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
were the ﬁrst to excite other mathematicians. We have already seen that Poinsot
praised Gauss’s work highly in 1807 and alerted French readers to the forthcoming
French translation of Gauss’s book. In the re-edition of his treatment of the solution
of equations (Lagrange 1808, 274), Lagrange did the same, calling Gauss’s work
“excellent”. He singled out the treatment of cyclotomy, which he called “original”
and “ingenious”, and the use in that theory of the concept of a primitive root, which
he called an “ingenious and happy idea” (1808, 275).
Gauss’s study has its origins in some more modest observations of Lagrange,
which he had published in the course of his Mémoire (1770) on the solution of
equations. There he had noted that the study of the equation
xn −1 = 0,
where n is composite, say n = pq, reduces to the study of an equation of degree p
and one of degree q. For, on setting xq = y one obtains the equation yp = 0. Let
this equation be solved, and α be one of its roots, then the original equation reduces
to the study of xq = α and on setting x =
q√α to the equation tq = 1. So it is
enough to consider equations of the form xn = 1 where n is a prime.
Lagrange passed over the case n = 2 and wrote n = 2p + 1. This gave him the
cyclotomic equation, after a division by x −1, in the form
x2p + x2p−1 + · · · + x2 + x + 1 = 0.

Cyclotomy
He divided through by xp and introduced the variable y = x + x−1. This enabled
him in principle to write Eq.(5.1) in powers of y. He deduced that when n is of the
form 2λ3μ5ν the cyclotomic equation can be solved by radicals. If the solution of
cubic equations is allowed, he added, then the cyclotomic equation can be solved by
radicals when n is of the form 2λ3μ5ν7ω. But one is halted at n = 11, he said, by
the appearance of a quintic equation.
This remark highlights an amusing ambiguity in the subject of solving equations
by radicals. Even the formula for the solution of the cubic equation exhibits cube
roots of arbitrary quantities, which may, for example, be complex. The search for
a formula involving radicals that would solve equations of higher degree, say n,
must surely be willing to accept pure nth roots. But in that case, why not accept
the ten roots other than 1 of the equation x11 −1 = 0? The answer would seem
to be that these roots are to be expressed by a formula involving the coefﬁcients of
the equation, and there was no such formula. On this supposition, cube roots can be
taken because the formula for the solution of the equation x3 + px + q = 0 in the
special case where p = 0 reduces to
3√−q. That said, the distinction is obscure and
disappears in the nineteenth century.
Lagrange then noted a way to solve equations of the form xn −1 = 0, n > 5,
had been opened up by de Moivre. It follows from his work, said Lagrange (p. 248),
that if x + x−1 = 2 cos ϕ then xn + x−n = 2 cos nϕ. This leads to the equations
x2 −2x cos ϕ + 1 = 0, and x2n −2xn cos ϕ + 1 = 0.
These have the solutions1
x = cos ϕ ± i sin ϕ, and xn = cos nϕ ± i sin nϕ,
where the same sign must be taken in each case, and clearly any solution of the ﬁrst
equation is a solution of the second.
Lagrange then observed that all the solutions are distinct and, except for x = 1,
complex. Moreover, when n is prime they are all powers of one of them. It is a little
more complicated to see that if n is composite, all the roots will be powers of some
αm, where α is a root and m is prime to n. He concluded his account with the explicit
solutions of xn −1 = 0, n = 1, 2, . . ., 6.
In the seventh and ﬁnal section of the (published) Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
Gauss dealt at length with roots of unity, concentrating on the case where they are
the roots other than 1 of the equation xp −1 = 0 where p is a prime, which is to
say that they are the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial
cp(x) = xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1 = 0.
(We shall drop the sufﬁx p when there is no risk of ambiguity.)
1Lagrange wrote √−1 where we have i.

5.2
The Case p = 7
51
He proved that the cyclotomic equation is irreducible, and that it can be
understood through the successive adjunction of the roots of equations of certain
degrees that divide p −1, as we shall see.2
Dedekind later commented that:
Here enters for the ﬁrst time the concept of irreducibility (art. 341) which has become
crucial for the whole orientation of later algebra; although Gauss makes only a limited use
of it (art. 346), I have no doubt that this fundamental principle has also led him to the
discovery of particular points and that he has preferred the synthetic presentation only for
the sake of brevity; certainly this is what the important words (art. 365) let us conclude:
“and we can prove with complete rigour that these higher equations cannot by any means
be avoided or reduced to lower ones [etc.].” The truth of the assertion contained in them
is easy to prove at the present stage of algebra, namely since the development of Gauss’s
thoughts by Abel and Galois. In fact, from the seed laid by Gauss, a science is born, which
one . . . could perhaps describe as the science of the algebraic afﬁnities between numbers,
or, if one wants to use an expression chosen by me, as the science of the afﬁnities between
ﬁelds.3
The cases p = 17 and p = 19 were the ones he used for illustrative purposes,
and they make a good introduction. However, the calculations involved can be rather
daunting, so I shall start with a less intimidating example, but one with its own
irritations. We shall see that Gauss introduced these ideas precisely to guide the
calculations and explain some regularities he had detected in the algebra—and it is
the algebra and the number theory of these objects that interested him, not their
trigonometry or geometry. As he put it, he aimed to make it “abundantly clear
that there is an intimate connection between this subject [cyclotomy] and higher
Arithmetic”.
5.2
The Case p = 7
In this case the cyclotomic equation is c(x) = x6 + x5 + · · · + 1 = 0. A typical
root is xn for some n ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Gauss had earlier called a number r
mod p with the property that every number mod p is a power of r a primitive
root mod p so he now looked for a primitive root mod 7. Such an element is 3:
written multiplicatively, the cyclic group G∗
7 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is generated by 3,
and modulo 7 the powers of 3 are:
{31 ≡3, 32 ≡2, 33 ≡6, 34 ≡4, 35 ≡5, 36 ≡1}.
2Dedekind was the ﬁrst to establish the irreducibility of equations of the form xϕ(m)−1 = 0, where
m is not prime and ϕ(m) is the number of numbers relatively prime to m; see Dedekind (1857).
3See Dedekind (1873, pp. 408–409) quoted in (Shaping, 115). Article 365 will occupy us later,
when we look at the reception of Wantzel’s work.

Cyclotomy
The exponent of a is deﬁned to be the value of n such that 3n ≡a mod 7. In
this case the exponents and the values are too often the same for this to be a good
teaching example, but nonetheless they display the corresponding elements of the
group, now written additively, as G+
6 . (Additively, because 3j × 3k = 3j+k.)
The element n in the (multiplicative version of the) group is now written as 3j,
with n = 3j. So in this group we calculate 6 × 4 by noting that 6 = 33 and 4 = 34
so
6 × 4 ≡33 × 34 ≡33+4 ≡37 ≡3 mod 7,
and indeed 6 × 4 ≡3 mod 7. Here we have used Fermat’s little theorem, that
n6 ≡1 mod 7. The point of passing from n numbers to j numbers is that the
corresponding exponents add (just like logarithms) so pattern spotting becomes
easier mod 7. When we write G in additive notation we shall call the elements
j-numbers, and denote it G+
6 ; in multiplicative notation we call the elements n-
numbers. Note that the identity element in G+
6 is 6, so from now on I shall replace
it by 0 when appropriate.
In modern language, we have a group isomorphism G = G∗
7 →G+
6 given by
n →j where n = 3j.
We can display the isomorphism between these groups this way:

The subgroup of G+
6 of order 2 generated by 3 is, of course, {3, 0}, and its cosets
are {4, 1} and {5, 2}. The corresponding roots are {x, x6}, {x3, x4} and {x2, x5}. We
pass from one to the next by replacing x by x3.
Let y = x + x6, which we shall write as y1 = x + x−1 because x7 = 1. Then it
is a simple matter of algebra to check that
y2
1 = x2 + 2 + x−2
and
y3
1 = x3 + 3(x + x−1) + x−3 = x3 + 3y + x−3,
and writing the given cyclotomic equation as
x3 + x2 + x + 1 + x−1 + x−2 + x−3 = 0
we ﬁnd that we have
y3
1 + y2
1 −2y1 −1 = 0.

5.3
The Case p = 19
53
We can check that the same equation is satisﬁed by y2 = x2 + x5 and by y3 =
x3 + x4.
Or we can argue that
y1 + y2 + y3 = −1, y1y2 + y2y3 + y3y1 = −2, and y1y2y3 = 1,
(5.2)
and come to the same conclusion.
Now, the deﬁning equations for y1, y2, y3 are quadratic equations for what we
can call x1, x2 and x3 respectively, and y2 and y3 are rational functions of y1. So
adjoining one of them to the rational ﬁeld adjoins all three, and so the original
cyclotomic equation, which is irreducible over the rationals, factors when any y is
adjoined. Indeed, the original equation of degree 6 becomes:
(x2 −xy1 + 1)(x2 −xy2 + 1)(x2 −xy3 + 1) = 0,
as we can check this by expanding it and using Eq. (5.2) above.
Notice that the map x →xk, k = 1, . . . , 6, induces a permutation of the roots
that sends xa to (xa)k, so any permutation of the roots is determined by its effect on
x. So the group of permutations of the roots is G∗
7. The group acts transitively on
the roots.
5.3
The Case p = 19
We take p = 19, as in Gauss, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, §353. The 18 roots of
c(x) = x18 + · · · + x + 1 = 0,
can be permuted, but not arbitrarily. Once the image of one root is given, the images
of the others are ﬁxed because they are all known rationally once one is given. Now,
all the roots are known explicitly, they are of the form
cos 2πk
19 + i sin 2πk
19 = e2πik/19, 1 ≤k ≤18,
so Gauss denoted them by their n value (but note that I have introduced the bars
above the numbers to keep a potential ambiguity at bay):
¯1, ¯2, . . . , ¯n, . . . ¯18,
where ¯k stands for e2πik/19.

Cyclotomy
Gauss found that 2 is a primitive root mod 19. The successive powers of 2 mod
19 are
21 ≡2, 22 ≡4, 23 ≡8, 24 ≡16, 25 ≡13, . . . , 218 ≡1 mod 19.
He now used the additive form of the group to hunt for subgroups.
Note that knowing the exponent of a enables us (as it did Gauss) to compute the
order of a, which is the least power, n, of a such that an ≡1 mod 19 (note that
by Lagrange’s theorem the order of a must divide 18, so it is either 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or
18). For, if a = 2j then an = 2jn, which will be equivalent to 1 mod 19 if and only
if jn is a multiple of 18. As an example, 4 ≡22, so we expect 4 to have order 9,
and indeed 49 ≡22·9 ≡218 ≡1, while 42n ̸≡1 for any smaller power of 4. In the
same spirit we easily ﬁnd that 11 ≡212, so the order of 11 is 3, because 18|12 × 3
and 3 is the least number n such that 12n is a multiple of 18. We ﬁnd, however, that
13 = 25, so the order of 13 is also 18.
The comparison with logarithms and exponents, 2j · 2k
=
2j+k, makes
calculations much easier. It was for this reason that Gauss introduced the exponents
and kept track of the roots not by the value of ¯k but by the corresponding exponent
n such that 2n ≡k mod 19.
Gauss (§353) focussed on the fact that 8 = 23 has order 6, and that the six powers
of 8 are {8, 64 ≡7, 18, 11, 12, 1}, and that these elements form a group (the group
generated by 8 mod 19).
The factorisation 19−1 = 2·3·3 suggested to Gauss that it would be worthwhile
looking at, for example, the 3rd power of the primitive root 23 = 8 and its 6 powers.
He observed that one recovers this set whatever element of it we begin with, denoted
it (6, 1), and called it a period. The 6 in the notation was chosen because the period
has 6 elements, the 1 because it has the element 1 in it. The other periods turn out
to be
(6, 2) = {2, 3, 5, 14, 16, 17} = (6, 3), and (6, 4) = {4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15}.
Of these (6, 1) is a subgroup of the permutations of the roots, the others its
cosets. Its cosets are obtained by increasing the j numbers by 1 and 2 respectively.
Gauss called them (6, 2) and (6, 4) because each has 6 elements and the ﬁrst coset
contains 2 (it also contains 3) and the second coset contains 4. This corresponds
to replacing n by 2n and 4n respectively, so the roots corresponding to (6, 2)
are (x2)8 = x16, (x2)7 = x14, etc: {x2, x3, x5, x14, x16, x17}. Finally, the roots
corresponding to the coset (6, 4) are {x4, x6, x9, x10, x13, x15}.
Gauss proved that the periods are well deﬁned (independent of any choices
made), that they are either disjoint or agree completely, and that their union is the
whole set of roots. Periods with the same number of roots he called similar (in the
case we are looking at, this number is 6) and he showed how to multiply them
together. This amounts to showing that the cosets themselves form a group.
Because Gauss was interested in factorising the equation x18 + · · · + x + 1 = 0
by adjoining roots of equations of lower degree, he looked at certain sums of the

5.3
The Case p = 19
55
periods. The sum of the roots in the subgroup (6, 1) is P = x8 + x7 + x18 + x11 +
x12 + x. He called the sum of the roots corresponding to (6, 2) P ′, and the sum of
the roots corresponding to (6, 4) P ′′. Straight-forward algebra shows that
P 2 = 2P + P ′ + 2P ′′ + 6,
and a little more algebra shows that
P 3 + P 2 −6P + 7 = 0.
It is also true that P ′ and P ′′ satisfy this cubic equation. This remarkable result
arises because the combination of the roots has been selected according to a rational
plan that reﬂects the underlying structure of the roots.
By adjoining a root of this equation, say P (and therefore the others) he then
could proceed to the equation for the periods within (6, 1), which are (2, 1), (2, 7),
and (2, 8).
So, still following Gauss, suppose we adjoin to the rational numbers the strange-
looking irrational numbers P, P ′, P ′′. We now repeat the trick, working with the
group (6, 1). It has an element of order 2 that we pick up as before by passing to the
additive form. The group is {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 0}, and we pick the subgroup {9, 0}. The
corresponding roots are x18 and x1, so Gauss called this subgroup (2, 1) because it
has 2 elements and one of them is associated to x1. Let’s call the sum of these roots
Q. The cosets of this subgroup in the group (6, 1) are {3, 12} and {6, 15} in additive
notation, the corresponding sets of roots are {x8, x11} with sum Q′ and {x7, x12}
with sum Q′′. In Gauss’s notation, this makes the cosets (2, 8) and (2, 7). The sum
of these is P, of course. We also ﬁnd that QQ′ + Q′Q′′ + Q′′Q = −P ′ −1 and
that QQ′Q′′ = P ′ + 2. So each of Q, Q′, Q′′ satisfy the cubic equation
x3 −Px2 −(P ′ + 1)x −(P ′ + 2) = 0,
all of whose coefﬁcients have been obtained already.
It remains to observe that the roots corresponding to the subgroup (2, 1) = {9, 0}
satisfy the equation
x2 −Qx + 1 = 0,
which is the quadratic equation whose roots were 1 and 18, so they are known once
Q is known. In this way all the 18 non-trivial 19th roots of unity were found by
solving two cubic and one quadratic equation.

Cyclotomy
The Regular 17-gon
A similar process applies with any prime number p. When p = 17 the result is
that all the 17th roots of unity are found by solving a sequence of four quadratic
equations. Solving a quadratic equation is a matter of extracting a square root, and
so a task that can be carried out, in classical terms, by a straight edge and circle
construction. So the regular 17-gon became the ﬁrst regular n-gon known to be
so constructible since Greek times, and indeed this construction works every time
p = 2n + 1 is prime.
In this case, the cyclotomic polynomial is ﬁrst factored into two polynomials of
degree 8 by adjoining

17) (8, 1), and the other root (8, 3), and looked ﬁrst
at the equation
x2 −(8, 1)x −1 = 0.
He called its roots (4, 1) and (4, 9), and chose for (4, 1) the root
1
2((8, 1) +

(8, 1)2 + 4) = 1
2(12 +

12 + 3(8, 1) + 4(8, 3)),
whose numerical value he determined to be 2.0494811777. Then he repeated the
analysis with (8, 3) in place of (8, 1) and obtained (4, 3) and (4, 10).
Next, Gauss considered the equation x2 −(4, 1)x + (4, 3) = 0, with roots (2, 1)
and (2, 13), and gave their numerical values as 1.8649444588 and 0.1845367189.
Now, the roots of the cyclotomic equation corresponding to (2, 1) are ζ and ζ 16 =
ζ −1, because they are the roots of x2 −(2, 1)x + 1 = 0, and they work out to be
0.9324722294 ± 0.3612416662i. The other powers of ζ he deduced from the other
equations in the tree of factorisations.

Chapter 6
Two of Gauss’s Proofs of Quadratic
Reciprocity
6.1
Introduction
In this chapter I discuss two of Gauss’s proofs of quadratic reciprocity: one (his
second) that uses composition of forms, and the other (his sixth) that uses cyclotomy.
The sixth was the last proof of this theorem he published, although he went on to
leave two more unpublished.
Famously, the theorem has acquired a great number of proofs—André Weil
estimated as many as 150, a number more or less conﬁrmed by the list in
Lemmermeyer (2000, Appendix B)—and although not all of them are very different
some come from deep and suggestive connections in the subject. Thus the Russian
mathematician Yuri Manin has written (in Lemmermeyer 2000, 22):
When I was very young I was extremely interested in the fact that Gauss found seven or
eight proofs of the quadratic reciprocity law. What bothered me was why he needed seven
or eight proofs. Every time I gained some more understanding of number theory I better
understood Gauss’s mind. Of course he was not looking for more convincing arguments—
one proof is sufﬁciently convincing. The point is, that proving is the way we are discovering
new territories, new features of the mathematical landscape.
I regard this chapter as one of the harder ones in the book (some help is offered in
the next chapter) and it is unusual for a book to present its most demanding material
early, so some explanation is in order. Gauss’s work was difﬁcult in many ways: it
is technical and depends on complicated expressions; it makes novel insights and
connections; it introduces new concepts. For many readers it is likely that it goes
outside their student education (which raises the question of what is it doing in a
history of modern algebra, which is a well-deﬁned subject) and that also makes
it hard. All of these problems are reasons for including this material. If Gauss’s
rewriting of number theory is to be appreciated as the huge change in mathematics
that it was then we have to understand its impact, and that involves considering
just how difﬁcult it was. How ﬁrmly one grasps the picture is a question of reading
what follows in various ways; I have tried to offer an outline, some detail, and a

simpler, more modern, account. But what Gauss did was not to take one more step
in the discovery of mathematics, it was to open up a new ﬁeld. Inevitably, his work
was difﬁcult—only rich visions count—and this chapter offers one opportunity to
consider what mathematics really is.
6.2
Composition and Quadratic Reciprocity
Gauss’s second proof relies on his theory of the composition of forms. Although
Gauss was far from clear on the point, his sharp distinction between proper
and improper equivalence was key to showing that composition of forms is—to
use a wild anachronism—almost a group operation. The qualiﬁcation ‘almost’ is
important, because it hints at the heart of the problem. As is discussed in more
detail in Appendix B, Gauss investigated when the composite of two forms (note
that they need not have the same discriminant) can be deﬁned, and discovered both
that it cannot always be deﬁned, and that when it can the answer is not unique (it
can always be varied by a transformation of the X, Y variables of the composite).
More precisely (§§235, 236), he showed that for two forms to have a composite
it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the ratios of the discriminants of the forms are
squares. He then showed that when composition is deﬁned it is associative (the
proof is particularly long and tiring). Only then did he show that composition is
well-deﬁned on proper equivalence classes: composition at the level of classes is,
we would say, a group operation. Here it turned out to be essential that proper
equivalence is used: the result is false if improper equivalence is admitted, a fact
that had halted Legendre’s investigations.
Recall that Gauss said that two strict equivalence classes of forms (with the same
‘determinant’) have the same order if and only if
gcd(a, b, c) = gcd(a′, b′, c′), and gcd(a, 2b, c) = gcd(a′, 2b′, c′).
The genus of a class is its complete set of characters, and these are determined by
the determinant and its prime factors.
Gauss introduced no symbols for composition, class, order, or genus, but it will
help if we have some, so I shall write C(f ) for the class of a form f , O(f ) for the
order of a form f and G(f ) for its genus, and denote the composition of the forms
f and f ′ by juxtaposition ff ′.
Because we are presently taking the deﬁnition of the composition of two forms
on trust, and because there is no simple expression for the coefﬁcients of ff ′ in
terms of the coefﬁcients of f and f ′, we can simply state the results concerning
the composition of forms that Gauss obtained. In Disquisitiones Arithmeticae §245,
Gauss proved that if
O(f ) = O(g) and O(f ′) = O(g′) then O(ff ′) = O(gg′),
so composition respects order.

6.2
Composition and Quadratic Reciprocity
59
Then in §§247 and 248 Gauss proved that G(f ) and G(f ′) determine G(ff ′),
and concluded in §249 that if
C(f ) = C(g), C(f ′) = C(g′), O(f ) = O(g), O(f ′) = O(g′)
and
G(f ) = G(g), G(f ′) = G(g′)
then
C(ff ′) = C(gg′).
A little later, §252, he deduced that for a given value of the ‘determinant’ and for
a given order, every genus contains the same number of classes. He also noted that
different orders may contain different numbers of classes.
He then turned his attention to what he had called ambiguous classes. These
arise when a form F can imply a form F ′ both properly and improperly. When this
happens, he noted that there is then a form G so that F implies G and G implies F ′
and G is improperly equivalent to itself. A form (a, b, c) is improperly equivalent
to itself if a divides 2b, b ̸= 0, and these forms Gauss called ambiguous. After a
lengthy analysis he concluded (in §260) that “if the number of properly primitive
classes of determinant D is r, and the number of properly primitive ambiguous
classes of this determinant D is n, then the number of all properly primitive classes
of the same determinant that can be produced by the duplication of a similar class
will be r/n.”1
He then proved this theorem (§261): Half of all the assignable characters for a
positive nonsquare determinant can correspond to no properly primitive genus and,
if the determinant is negative, to no properly primitive positive genus. He observed
that
it does not yet follow from this that half of all the assignable characters actually correspond
to properly primitive (positive) genera, but later we shall establish the truth of this profound
proposition concerning the most deeply hidden properties of numbers
He then (§262) deduced the theorem of quadratic reciprocity. I omit most of
Gauss’s proof of the theorem for −1, 2, and −2, and quote only his proof for general
odd p (a prime) and q. But since it uses one part of that, I quote it ﬁrst. Recall that
Gauss wrote aRp for what we would write with the Legendre symbol as

a
p

= 1,
and aNp for

a
p

= −1. He also used Rp to stand for testing whether a number is
a residue modulo p.
1Recall that a form (a, b, c) is properly primitive if the greatest common divisor of a, 2b, c is 1.

Two of Gauss’s Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
II. −1 is a residue of any prime number p of the form 4n + 1. For the character of the
form (−1, 0, p), as of all properly primitive forms of determinant p will be Rp and
therefore −1Rp.
. . .
VIII. Any prime number p of the form 4n + 1 is a nonresidue of any odd number q that
is a nonresidue of p. For clearly if p were a residue of q there would be a properly
primitive form of determinant p with the character Np.
IX. Similarly if an odd number q is a nonresidue of a prime number p of the form 4n+3,
−p will be a nonresidue of q; otherwise there would be a properly primitive positive
form of determinant −p with character Np.
X. Any prime number p of the form 4n + 1 is a residue of any prime number q which is
a residue of p. If q is also of the form 4n + 1 this follows immediately from VIII; but
if q is of the form 4n + 3, −q will also be a residue of p (by II) and so pRq by IX.
XI. If a prime number q is a residue of another prime number p of the form 4n + 3,
−p will be a residue of q. For if q is of the form 4n + 1 it follows from VIII that
pRq and so (by II) −pRq; this method does not apply when q is of the form 4n + 3,
but it can easily be resolved by considering the determinant +pq. For, since of the
four characters assignable for this determinant Rp, Rq; Rp, Nq, Np, Rq; Np, Nq,
two of them cannot correspond to any genus and since the characters of the forms
(1, 0, −pq), (−1, 0, pq) are the ﬁrst and fourth respectively, the second and third
are the characters which correspond to no properly primitive form of determinant
pq. And since by hypothesis the character of the form (q, 0, −p) with respect to the
number p is Rp, its character with respect to the number q must be Rq and therefore
−pRq. Q.E.D.
If in propositions VIII and IX we suppose q is a prime number, these propositions joined
with X and XI will give us the fundamental theorem of the preceding section.
It may help to re-write Gauss’s claims in a modern notation, in which they say
1. VIII:
p ≡1 (4) and
 q

To prove them, we argue ﬁrst that given a quadratic form of discriminant −D,
then if −D ≡□(m) there are x and y such that x2 + Dy2 ≡0 (m). We deﬁne

6.3
Smith’s Commentary on Gauss’s Sixth Proof
61
Q1(x, y) = x2 + Dy2, which has discriminant −D, and observe that Q1(x, y) →
km, so there is another quadratic form of discriminant −D such that Q2 →m.
Now, to prove VIII we consider a quadratic form of discriminant −p. We look at
the ﬁxed relationships, and because p ̸≡−1 (4) we can only ask of the odd numbers
represented by the quadratic form if they are congruent to squares mod p. Suppose

p
q

= 1. Then there is a quadratic form of discriminant −p that represents q, but
this gives a contradiction with q ̸≡□(p).
The other arguments proceed similarly, as you should check. Then, knowing the
theorem for

−1
p

, you can deduce the theorem of quadratic reciprocity.
Precisely Half the Assignable Characters Occur
The proof of this “deeply hidden property numbers”, as Gauss called it, is the most
difﬁcult result in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. It involved him in a “digression”
into the theory of ternary forms, and when the proof was ﬁnished he remarked (DA
§267) that
these theorems are among the most beautiful in the theory of binary forms because, despite
their extreme simplicity, they are so profound that a rigorous demonstration requires the
help of many other investigations.
It is not possible to survey Gauss’s proof here. Even Dedekind declined to do so,
writing that
It is impossible for us to communicate the proof, which Gauss has based on the theory of
ternary quadratic forms
before going on to give Dirichlet’s later proof (see Dedekind (1871, 407)). The
theorem remains central to many presentations of algebraic number theory, and I
believe it is the origin of the idea that the best mathematics has depth (see Gray
(2015))—an idea ﬁrst adopted by German mathematicians after Gauss.
6.3
Smith’s Commentary on Gauss’s Sixth Proof
In his Report on the theory of numbers the English mathematician Henry Smith
gave a comprehensive account of number theory as it stood in 1859. In §§20–21
he surveyed Gauss’s fourth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity.2 To follow
Smith’s account of the sixth proof, in §21, we need to know that in his account of
the fourth proof Smith introduced the function
1 + rk + r4k + r9k + · · · + r(n−1)2k = ψ(k, n),

an important role in Gauss’s fourth proof. Note that ψ(1, n) = i(n−1)2/4√n. Smith

Gauss has given a purely algebraical proof of the theorems (1), (2), and (3), on which this
demonstration depends. The third is a simple consequence of the arithmetical property of
the multinomial coefﬁcient, already referred to in Art. 10 of this Report; to establish the ﬁrst

be observed that here no necessity arises for the consideration of composite values of n in
the function ψ(k, n); nor for the determination of the ambiguous sign in the formula (A).
In this specialized form, Gauss’s sixth proof has been given by Jacobi (in the 3rd edit. of
Legendre’s Théorie des Nombres, vol. ii. p. 391), Eisenstein (Crelle’s [Journal], vol. xxviii.
p. 41), and Cauchy (Bulletin de Férussac, Sept. 1829, and more fully Mém. de l’lnstitut, vol.
xviii. p. 451, note iv. of the Mémoire), quite independently of one another, but apparently
without its being at the time perceived by any of those eminent geometers that they were
closely following Gauss’s method. (See Cauchy’s Postscript at the end of the notes to his
Mémoire; also a memoir by M. Lebesgue in Liouville’s [Journal], vol. xii. p. 457; and
a foot-note by Jacobi, Crelle’s [Journal], vol. xxx. p. 172, with Eisenstein’s reply to it,
Crelle’s [Journal], vol. xxxv. p. 273.)3
Some comments on Smith’s commentary are in order. It can be written more
simply using the congruence notation and writing out a few intermediate steps, as
follows. I shall also write cp(x) for 1−xp

Introduction
Gauss’s ﬁrst proof of quadratic reciprocity was given in Section IV of the Dis-
quisitiones Arithmeticae. Gauss went on to publish ﬁve more, leaving a further
two unpublished; he also knew that these different proofs hinted at important
connections to as-yet undiscovered parts of mathematics. But insofar as some of
these proofs were intended to explore or illustrate these connections they were of
varying levels difﬁculty and not all suitable for beginners. The simplest is the third
proof, which was adopted by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in lectures that he gave
in the 1850s and which formed part of his book Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie
(Lectures on Number Theory) that did so much to bring number theory to a wide
audience of mathematicians.1 We look at this proof here, and then turn to look at
Dirichlet’s Lectures more broadly.
7.2
Gauss’s Third Proof of Quadratic Reciprocity
First, Gauss proved a result nowadays known as Gauss’s lemma. Fix a prime number
p and consider the set P = {1, 2, . . .p −1}. Let
A = {1, 2, . . . 1
2(p −1)} and B = {1
2(p + 1), 1
2(p + 3), . . ., p −1},
so P = A ∪B. Let k ∈P, and consider kA = {k, 2k, . . .k(p −1)} taken mod p.
Some elements of kA belong to A, some, say μ in number, to B. Gauss ﬁrst showed

translation see Smith’s Source Book, which is accessible via Google books.

that k(p−1)/2 ≡±1 mod p according as μ is even or odd, and so k is or is not a
quadratic residue of p according as μ is even or odd.
The theorem then followed after some fairly straight-forward arguments. On the
left I look at a simple particular case, on the right at the general case.
We assume throughout that
p = 2p′ + 1, q = 2q′ + 1.
First Part of the Proof
p = 11, P = {1, . . . , 10}
P = {1, . . . , p −1}
p′ = 5, q = 7
q
A = {1, . . . , 5}, B = {6, . . . , 10}
A = {1, . . . , p′}, B = {p′ + 1, . . . , p −1}

qA = {q, 2q, . . . , p′q}
= {2, 3} ∪{6, 7, 10}
Aq ∪Bq, where Aq = qA ∩{1, . . . p′}
A7 = {2, 3}, B7 = {6, 7, 10}
and Bq = qA ∩{p′ + 1, . . . p −1}
card{6, 7, 10} = 3
cardBq = μ
¯B7 = {11 −6, 11 −7, 11 −10} =
Consider ¯Bq = {p −bj |bj ∈Bq}
 aj ¯bk = 2 · 3 · (11 −6) · (11 −7)(11 −10) = 5! ⇒
 aj ¯bk = p′! ⇒
 aj ¯bk = 2 · 3 · (11 −6) · (11 −7)(11 −10)
 aj ¯bk ≡ aj bk(−1)μ (mod p)
≡(−1)32 · 3 · 6 · 7 · 10 (mod 11)
But  2 · 3 · 6 · 7 · 10 ≡5!75 (mod 11)
But  aj bk ≡p′!qp′ (mod p)
So 75 ≡(−1)3 ≡

So qp′ ≡

Check: the squares mod 11 are {1, 4, 9, 5, 3}, so 7 is not a square mod 11.

We have 7k = p[7k] + rk, 1 ≤k ≤5

Let the sum of the former be A and of the latter B

Let M = 

so their sum is
p2 −1
8
= μp + A −B,
and so
p2 −1

(q −1) = (M −μ)p + 2B,
and we only need to ﬁnd if μ is even or odd. We have
μ ≡M + p2 −1
8
(q −1) mod2
Now assume that q is odd, positive and less than p, and so that μ ≡M mod 2.
Look at the sequence [7k], 1 ≤k ≤5
Look at the sequence [kq], 1 ≤k ≤p′
It goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
It goes 0, . . . , q′

Look at where each sequence steps up. How many steps of q are just less than an
integer t and how many steps of q just exceed t? When the step occurs we have

so
s < tp
q < s + 1,

which, said Dirichlet, is obviously valid for any two odd positive primes because it
is symmetric in p and q and one must be less than the other. To ﬁnish off, note that

which is quadratic reciprocity.
Weil, in his little book Number Theory for Beginners (1979, 55), proved quadratic
reciprocity in more or less this way. His version of the Gauss lemma was this: Let
p = 2n+1 and call a Gaussian set modulo p a set of coset representatives u1, . . . yn
for the subgroup H = {±1} in G = Z/pZ, so any number is congruent to a unique
±uj. In G ﬁx a non=zero element a and deﬁne ej by auj = ejuk. Then a is or is
not a quadratic residue mod p according as the product e1 . . . en = 1 or −1.
The quadratic character of 2 mod p follows from taking a = 2 in the Gauss
lemma. The quadratic reciprocity theorem follows in the same way, with a = q.
7.3
Dirichlet’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
Peter Gustav Lejeune-Dirichlet was not just the most important German mathemati-
cian in the 1830s, 40s, and 50s, he was one of the most important mathematicians of
the time. He not only made Gauss’s number theory more accessible, he signiﬁcantly
deepened it by bringing in analytic methods that have their origin in some
observations of Euler’s. His results, and his insights into them, have created a subject
that is more active than ever today, almost two centuries later. He also brought
rigorous epsilon–delta analysis to Germany and by being much more careful than
Cauchy helped place it securely at the heart of analysis, and towards the end of his
life he was a powerful inﬂuence on Bernhard Riemann.
His ﬁnest achievement was to give an analytic formula for the class number of
binary quadratic forms, which unfortunately we cannot describe here. It opened up
the ﬁeld of Euler products and the zeta function, and it belongs intimately with his
proof that every arithmetic progression {a + kb | (a, b) = 1, k = 1, 2, . . .} contains
inﬁnitely many primes.

7.3
Dirichlet’s Theory of Quadratic Forms
71
Dirichlet was born in 1805 in Duren, which is now part of Germany but was
then a French territory under the rule of Napoleon, and to study mathematics in
1822 he took himself to Paris, which was then by far the most important place
for the subject. There he became a tutor to the children of General Foy, and this
introduced him to the elite circles of Parisian society as well as members of the
Académie des Sciences. In this way he came to know Joseph Fourier, who was
the perpetual secretary of the Académie, and his (1829) is the ﬁrst major paper on
the question of whether a Fourier series converges to the function it represents. But
he had already identiﬁed number theory as his deepest love, and he was able to
show that Fermat’s Last Theorem for n = 5 is false: there are no non-zero integer
solutions to x5 + y5 = z5. Or rather, he was able to get close to establishing this
conclusion, and Legendre completed it, sad to say in a manner that seemed to give
Legendre more credit and to diminish Dirichlet’s contribution.
In 1823 General Foy died, but by then Dirichlet had met and impressed
Alexander von Humboldt, who was already an inﬂuential ﬁgure in Prussian society,
and when Dirichlet returned to Germany in 1827 Humboldt was helpful in obtaining
a professorship for him at the newly-founded University of Berlin, which was
conferred in 1831. On the way home, Dirichlet visited Gauss in Göttingen. There
seem to be no record of what they discussed, but Dirichlet wrote to his mother that
Gauss had received him kindly and that he had formed a better impression of Gauss
than he had expected.2 In 1855, Dirichlet moved to Göttingen as Gauss’s successor.
In his introduction to his ﬁrst edition of Dirichlet’s Lectures, Dedekind wrote
that Dirichlet had originally given these lectures in Göttingen between 1855/56, and
that he had heard the most important of them himself when a student between 1855
and 1858. Like any lecturer, Dirichlet had to decide what, within his chosen topic,
he was going to include, where he was going to leave his listeners and readers,
and how he was going to get them there. His preferred mode as a writer was to set
up everything that one was going to need ﬁrst, and then to use this information as
the need arose. So he supplied a chapter on divisors of numbers: greatest common
divisors, prime and composite numbers, the Euler φ function—the number φ(m) is
the number of positive integers less than and relatively prime to m, so φ(5) = 4—
and related topics. Then came a chapter on modular arithmetic. Then came a chapter
on quadratic reciprocity, with full proofs.
Chapter 4 was on binary quadratic forms, which, following Gauss, he wrote
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2,
and abbreviated to (a, b, c). To study, for example, 4x2 + 3xy + y2 he studied its
double, 8x2 + 6xy + 2y2 and derived the properties of the given form from those of
its double.

1984, 144–147).

Dirichlet’s Lectures on Quadratic Forms
He noted that
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = 1
a

(ax + by)2 −(b2 −ac)y2
,
so b2 −ac cannot be a perfect square else the form would be a product of linear
factors. He called b2−ac the determinant of the form, and denoted it D—be careful,
it is the negative of the determinant of the matrix
a b
b c

, so D = −(ac −b2).
Henceforth D will not be a square.
He wrote out explicitly what happens to the form ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 under the
linear transformation
x = αx′ + βy′
y = γ x′ + δy′,
and noted that each number representable by the second form can be represented by
the ﬁrst form. Moreover, if the transformed form is a′x2 + 2b′xy + c′y2 then the
relationship between the determinants is
D′ = b′2 −a′c′ = (αδ −βγ )2D.
Because the multiplying factor is a square, D and D′ have the same sign. If
(αδ −βγ ) is positive the transformation is said to be proper, otherwise improper.
Transformations can be followed by others, and the product of an even number of
improper transformations is proper.
Two equivalent forms represent the same numbers. A sufﬁcient condition is that
one can be transformed into the other by a transformation of the same determinant,
for both D/D′ and D′/D must be integer squares. So D and D′ must be ±1. If D = 1
the equivalence is proper, otherwise improper.
Exercises
1. Show that if (a, b, c) and (a′, b′, c′) have the same determinant, and a = a′, and
b ≡b′ mod a then the two forms are properly equivalent, and that a suitable
transformation is

2. Show that (a, b, c) and (c, −b, a) are properly equivalent.
Forms can be improperly equivalent to themselves. This happens when there
are two forms both properly and improperly equivalent to each other; each is
then improperly equivalent to itself. The improper transformation establishing this

73
equivalence is then necessarily of the form
 α β
γ −α

. When moreover γ = 0 it
follows that α = ±1 and αβ = 2b, which Dirichlet, quoting Gauss, called a forma
anceps, usually if poorly translated as an ambiguous or two-sided form. Dirichlet
proved that a form improperly equivalent to itself is equivalent to a two-sided form.
Gauss had shown the importance of concentrating on proper equivalence, and
Dirichlet followed him. In the study of (proper) equivalence classes of forms he
singled out two central questions:
1. How to decide when two forms of the same determinant are equivalent;
2. How to ﬁnd all the transformations that send one of two equivalent forms to the
other (discussed in the DA, §§178, 179, for forms of negative determinant).
The ﬁrst was discussed in the DA, §173, for forms of negative determinant, when
the answer is found by reducing them to canonical form. Gauss also took note of
whether the equivalence, if it exists, is proper, improper, or both.
Recognising that these questions might seem too dry, he motivated them by
showing how the theory of the representation of numbers by quadratic forms
reduced to them (which Gauss had discussed in the DA, §180, for forms of negative
determinant). Consider the equation
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = m.
Dirichlet’s method is a simpliﬁcation of Gauss’s. He noticed that it is enough
to look for numbers x and y which are relatively prime (these are called proper
representations). Therefore there are integers η and ξ such that xη −yξ = 1. The
transformation
x ξ
y η

sends (a, b, c) to the equivalent form (m, n, l)—check the
ﬁrst coefﬁcient! Because n2 −ml = D and D is not a square, we have m ̸= 0 and
so we have the important result that D is a quadratic residue of m. Furthermore, n
is a root of the congruence z2 ≡D mod m. It is, of course, possible to ﬁnd other
integers η′ and ξ′ such that xη′ −yξ′ = 1, but Dirichlet showed that the resulting
n′ satisﬁes the congruence n′ ≡n mod m. Dirichlet therefore concluded that the
representation problem reduces to his two central questions, because we may follow
this procedure:
1. is D is a quadratic residue of m? If not, m is not representable. If it is a residue
2. ﬁnd all the roots, n, of z2 ≡D mod m, and with each n look at (m, n, l). If m is
representable then (a, b, c) and (m, n, l) are equivalent, so one must be able to
answer the question: are they equivalent? If they are not, m is not representable.
If they are equivalent
3. ﬁnd all the transformations sending one to the other (the second of the central
problems). Each such transformation gives an x and a y such that ax2 + 2bxy +
cy2 = m.

74

Dirichlet’s Lectures on Quadratic Forms
Dirichlet noted that it is not easy to ﬁnd all transformations mapping one form to
another, but it is enough to ﬁnd one, for if t and t′ are two such transformations then
t′t−1 maps the ﬁrst form to itself.3 Now he let σ be the greatest common divisor of
a, 2b, c, so all representable numbers are necessarily divisible by σ. He called σ the
divisor of the form.
Exercises
1. 2b/σ is even if and only if σ is the greatest common divisor of a, 2b, c.
2. 2b/σ is odd if and only if σ/2 is the greatest common divisor of a, 2b, c.
In the ﬁrst case, the simplest form with determinant D is (σ, 0, −D
σ ). In the
second case, the simplest form with determinant D is (σ, 1
2σ, σ 2−4D
4σ
). The simplest
form (1, 0, −D) is called the principal form with determinant D.
Dirichlet denoted the greatest common divisor of the three numbers a, b, c
(careful, not 2b!) by τ. In the ﬁrst case τ = σ; in the second case τ = σ/2. If
τ = 1 the form is said to be primitive, and if σ = 1 properly primitive or of the
ﬁrst kind. If τ = 1 and σ = 2 it is improperly primitive. If τ > 1 the form is
said to be derived from the corresponding primitive form. Since equivalent forms
have the same divisor, which may therefore be said to be the divisor of a class of
forms, and following Gauss Dirichlet called the collection of all forms with the same
determinant and divisor an order.
At this point I shall skip over a topic in Dirichlet’s lectures, which comes straight
from Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. In §62 Dirichlet discussed the way of
ﬁnding a transformation of a form (with determinant D and divisor σ) to itself
reduces to solving the equation t2 −Du2 = σ 2. He noted that this is not too hard
when D is negative because the equation has only ﬁnitely many solutions, but much
harder when D is positive because the equation now has inﬁnitely many solutions,
and so he decided to do the easier case ﬁrst. I skip the argument in §62 and now
resume his account.
He began his account of quadratic forms with negative determinants with the
reduction theory of Lagrange, as reﬁned by Gauss to a theory of proper equivalence.
A form (a, b, c) is said to be reduced when
c ≥a ≥2|b|.
Every form is equivalent to a reduced form, so the question of interest is: when are
two reduced forms equivalent? Two pages of elementary algebra established that
this only happens when either the forms are (a, a/2, c) and (a, −a/2, c) and the

, or (a, b, a) and (a, −b, a) and the transformation is
0 −1


. The proof made essential use of the fact that the determinant of the form
is negative.
It follows at once that the number of equivalence classes is ﬁnite for each negative
determinant, and Dirichlet drew the classical consequences:
1. every positive prime of the form 4n + 1 is expressible as a sum of two squares in
essentially a unique way;
2. every positive prime of the form 8n + 1 or 8h + 3 is expressible as a sum of a
square and the double of a square in essentially a unique way;
3. every positive prime of the form 3n + 1 is expressible as a sum of a square and
the triple of a square in essentially a unique way.
Then came the ﬁrst of the more troubling cases:
1. every prime of the form 20n + 1 or 20n + 9 is representable in four ways by the
form (1, 0, 5);
2. every prime of the form 20n + 3 or 20n + 7 is representable in four ways by the
form (2, 1, 3).
Dirichlet now turned to the harder case of forms with positive determinants and
gave a complete solution there too. But, as he noted, the methods are very different
and I shall not follow him there (it leads through Pell’s equation and continued
fractions). But it is important to note that this problem was solved as well. In
particular, although the number of reduced forms is ﬁnite, reduced forms can be
equivalent in complicated ways, and the divide presaged by t2 −Du2 = σ 2 returns
to the story.
Chapter 5 of the lectures was devoted to a fresh account of one of Dirichlet’s
greatest discoveries: the existence of an analytical formula for the class number
(the number of equivalence classes of forms of a given determinant).4 It would
take us too far into difﬁcult mathematics to cover this—see the account in Scharlau
and Opolka (1984, pp. 109–143) which the authors modestly call a sketch—but we
should note several historically important facts:
1. there is a formula;
2. it was found after a lot of difﬁcult, delicate analysis;
3. its justiﬁcation is close to the one Dirichlet also gave for the theorem that there
are inﬁnitely many primes in arithmetic progressions {an+b : gcd (a, b) = 1};
4. the formula does not answer the question: How many determinants are there with

In the last four chapters we have seen the origins of modern number theory. Gauss’s
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae gave a coherent structure to what had been rather more
scattered results, with an acknowledged starting point, a theory, and some very
difﬁcult, deep ideas by the end. It helped establish number theory, certainly in
Germany, as a highly prestigious branch of mathematics. It is worth reﬂecting on
this: how is it that some topics in mathematics become important?
We have already seen that many ideas which Gauss presented were already in
the literature. But note that on some occasions he found that their supposed ‘proofs’
were ﬂawed, in the case of quadratic reciprocity badly so. His successful work
helped establish that there is a theory. By giving it an elementary starting point
Gauss gave number theory something that the advanced work of Lagrange had
lacked, and by taking the subject well beyond where his illustrious predecessor had
left it Gauss gave the subject of quadratic forms a new depth and a greater insight.
In fair part, his success was due to his theory of the composition of forms.
This brings us to a key point: what is so good about composition of forms,
especially when it is so difﬁcult to carry out? We can observe, as historians, that
even the best of Gauss’s contemporaries and successors skirted round this point.
But somehow it underpins the theory of characters (in a way that Lagrange’s ideas
had not) and character theory is a major step in answering the basic question: which
quadratic forms ax2 + bxy + cy2 of a given discriminant represent a given number
N? Gauss did not give a complete answer, but the key to the importance of the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is there. Had it answered every question, including the
basic one, it would have killed the subject, but its depth and obscurity acted as a
lure. It said: First master this book, then extend it. So two good questions to answer
would be to determine what Gauss’s character theory accomplished, and how the
composition theory of forms enters into, or enables, character theory.
It has not been possible in this course to make a comparison of Legendre’s book
on number theory and the one by Gauss, and to my knowledge no-one has ever
properly done so. But we have seen one grievous ﬂaw in Legendre’s work (quadratic
reciprocity) and one success that perhaps Gauss should have been more positive
about: a near discovery of composition of forms. Legendre’s book sold well in
French for decades, and not just because his French was easier to read than Gauss’s
Latin: it contained real insights. One should not forget it in any account of the rise
of number theory.
But there was more to the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae than quadratic forms.
The theory of cyclotomy was almost wholly new, and it made great sense of many
earlier results. We can proﬁtably compare Gauss’s account of what radicals enter the
resolution of a cyclotomic equation with Lagrange’s investigation of what general
polynomial equations are solvable by radicals on the one hand, and, in due course,
with Galois theory. In each case the aim of the mathematician was to explain how
some calculations work.

The historian has a major clue (and a mathematical friend) in the work of
Dirichlet. It is clear that if a mathematician of his calibre felt it right to write an
elementary book explaining Gauss’s work then he thought it was both difﬁcult and
valuable. His Lectures do dispel the mysteries of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
(but look for what he did not write about too) and if we look at his account we can
begin to get a clearer sense not only of the subject Gauss re-created but of what was
important about it.
Appendix: Cubic and Quartic Reciprocity
Cubic and quartic reciprocity, as their names suggest, are the generalisations to 3rd
and 4th powers respectively, of quadratic reciprocity. On the face of it, there is no
reason to believe that there will be such a generalisation. For example, the theory of
quadratic forms does not generalise to cubic forms, so it was a matter of discovery
and numerical experiment to see if the theory generalises. In fact, it does, and it was
to prove very interesting and challenging, but we cannot pursue it here.
However, we should note that the way Gauss found to generalise quadratic
reciprocity to 4th powers in 1831 made essential use of the introduction of complex
numbers, speciﬁcally integers of the form m+in, m, n ∈Z. The law, he discovered,
is most simply expressed and proved in terms of primes in this ring (nowadays called
the ring of Gaussian integers), and in this ring certain ordinary primes cease to be
prime. For example 5 = (2 + 1)(2 −i), and generally primes of the form 4n + 1,
being sums of two squares, say x2 + y2, factorise as (x + iy)(x −iy).

Introduction
We now turn to what today is regarded as a different branch of algebra, the solution
of polynomial equations, although, as we have seen, Gauss’s work on the ‘higher
arithmetic’ was not automatically regarded as being part of algebra (and some of
its deepest connections were made with analysis). We shall ﬁnd that polynomial
algebra also evolved in the direction of deepening conceptual insight, so here too
we witness one of the origins of the transformation from school algebra to modern
algebra.
Explicit solutions to quadratic, cubic and quartic equations were well known by
the late eighteenth century, but there progress had stopped; there was no formula
known for solving equations of the ﬁfth degree. In 1770, Lagrange attempted to
understand how the methods used to solve equations of low degree could either be
generalised to equations of the 5th degree or shown not to help.

The Solution of the Cubic Equation
The solution of the cubic equations by Italian mathematicians at the start of the
sixteenth century has been described in many histories of mathematics.1 Here we
have space only for the underlying mathematics. Consider the similarity in form
1See (Barrow-Green, Gray, and Wilson, 2018) for a recent account. In the early years, and perhaps
until Gauss, it was assumed that the equations considered have real coefﬁcients.

between these two equations:
x3 + px + q = 0
(u + v)3 −3uv(u + v) −(u3 + v3) = 0.
The ﬁrst of these is the cubic equation whose solution is sought; the second is
an algebraic identity, true for all values of u and v. So, if it is possible to arrange
matters so that p is −3uv, and q is −(u3 + v3), then the formal similarity between
the equations will ensure that x is u + v. So it remains only to discover those values
of u and v that yield 3uv = −p and u3 + v3 = −q. This can be done by noticing
that u3 and v3 are the roots of the quadratic equation t2 + qt −p3/27 = 0 and so
u =

(q/2)2 + (p/3)3,
v =


(−q/2) −

(q/2)2 + (p/3)3.
The solution to the original cubic is then x = u + v.
Or rather, it would be if we knew which cube root to take. Let us take u and v
each to be one of the above values, and agree that ω is a primitive cube root of unity
(ω ̸= 1, ω3 = 1).
Then we have these candidates for roots to consider:
ωku + ωmv, k, m = 0, 1, 2.
A little algebra shows that we must have k + m ≡0 (mod 3), so the solutions of the
cubic are
u + v, ωu + ω2v, ω2u + ωv.
In terms of the value of the formula, there are several different types of cubic.
The occurrence of complex numbers is counter-intuitive. Consider, as Cardano did
in Chapter XIII of his Ars Magna (1543), the book in which the theory of cubic
equations was written down for the ﬁrst time, this cubic:
x3 −8x + 3 = 0.
One root is x = −3, and the other two are x = 1
2(3 ±

5), so they are all real. But
the formula seems to involve square roots of complex numbers, because in this case

is negative. But for cubic equations with only one real root but two complex roots
the formula gives the real root without involving complex numbers. This strange
behaviour might be an annoying feature of the formula, and one might hope that
another formula could be found that did not have this defect, but that was not to be:
the solution to cubics with three real roots leads through complex numbers. This
is the phenomenon of the irreducible case, and was not to be explained until the
nineteenth century (see Sect. 9.4 below).
What is more, even if the roots are integers the formula may disguise this
magniﬁcently. Consider this famous example given by Cardano (1543, Ch. XI)
x3 + 6x −20 = 0.
The only real root of this equation is x = 2, but the formula gives the unpromising
x =

are always three distinct cube roots of a non-zero number and two distinct square
roots, so you have six expressions for the roots of the original cubic equation.
Can you sort out which expressions are roots and which are not?
The Solution of the Quartic Equation
Cardano acquired a servant or pupil in the late 1530s called Lodovico Ferrari, who
seems to have been so violent at times that Cardano was frightened of him, but who
turned out to be a brilliant mathematician who always acknowledged a lifelong debt
to Cardano.2 It was Ferrari who discovered how to solve the quartic (4th power)
equation; his solution was published in Chapter XXXIX of the Ars Magna. The
equation can always be put in the form
x4 + px2 + qx + r = 0.
Ferrari had the idea of putting x4 on one side and all the others on the other side and
then trying to complete the square for the terms in x2. So he wrote
x4 = −px2 −qx −r,
(8.1)
2See Cardano, ‘Vita Lodovici Ferarii Bonoinesis’, in Opera Omnia 9, 568–569, and Morley, H.

and added 2zx2 + z2 to each side. This gave him a square for the terms on the left
hand side. So he wrote
x4 + 2zx2 + z2 = (x2 + z)2 = (2z −p)x2 −qx + (z2 −r),
and looked for the value of z that makes the right-hand side a perfect square. This is
found, by the b2 −4ac test, to be a root of
q2 = 4(2z −p)(z2 −r),
(8.2)
which expands into
8z3 −4pz2 −8rz + 8pr −q2 = 0.
Alternatively, we write
(x2 + z)2 = (αx −β)2 ⇔
α2 = 2z −p, 2αβ = q, β2 = z2 −r,
so
q2 = 4(2z −p)(z2 −r).
Also
α =

2z −p, β =

z2 −r,
so Eq. (8.1) remains irreducible on adjoining z, but not on adjoining √2z −p or
√
z2 −r (notice that if we adjoin one of these square roots we adjoin the other, by
Eq. (8.2)).
The Eq. (8.2) is a cubic in z and so, by Cardano’s earlier work, solvable! Taking
the (any?) value of z that is a solution of this equation, one solves the corresponding
equation for x2 and takes square roots to get the required values of x.
There’s an interesting little count to do here. Solving a cubic equation involves
taking a square root and a cube root (and 2 × 3 = 6 = 3!) and now we know that
solving a quartic equation involves taking a square root and a cube root and then
two square roots (and 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24 = 4!).
Polynomial Equations and Partially Symmetric Expressions in Their Roots
The ﬁrst key insight into the process of solving an equation by radicals was to
observe that given a polynomial equation of degree n with n distinct roots, there

84
8
Is the Quintic Unsolvable?
might be expressions in the roots that are somewhat symmetric. That is to say that
while the group of symmetries of the n roots is the full permutation group Sn,
there might be expressions in the roots that are invariant under some but not all
these permutations. The sum of the roots and the product of the roots do not help,
because they are invariant under all permutations of the roots and are, of course,
the coefﬁcients respectively and up to sign of the xn−1 term and the constant term
of the given equation. However, there might be expressions in the roots that take
more than 1 value under the action of Sn but, say, k less than n! values. These
expressions should satisfy polynomial equations of degree k, and if they do and
if k < n then these equations should contribute to the attempt to solve the given
equation by radicals. It is the purpose of the next few paragraphs to spell out the
details of this insight.
Consider the equation
xn −a1xn−1 + · · · + (−1)n−1an−1x + (−1)nan = 0.
(8.3)
Let its roots be u1, u2, . . . un, which we shall assume are distinct. Then, as is well
known,

uj = a1,

j<k
ujuk = a2, . . . , u1u2, . . . un = an.
The crucial fact is that any algebraic expression in the roots which is fully symmetric
(that is, invariant under every permutation of the roots) is a rational expression in
the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an of Eq. (8.3). This implies that any partially symmetric
expression in the roots satisﬁes a polynomial equation of some degree whose
coefﬁcients are rational expressions in the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an of the original
Eq. (8.3). More precisely, suppose α is an algebraic expression in the roots of the
Eq. (8.3) that takes only k values as the roots are permuted, say α1 = α, α2, . . . , αk.
Let
β1 =

αj, β2 =

j<k
αjαk, . . . , βk = α1α2 . . . αk.
Then the αs satisfy the polynomial equation
xk −β1xk−1 + · · · + (−1)k−1βk−1x + (−1)kβk = 0,
(8.4)
and each coefﬁcient βj is fully symmetric and so rational in the coefﬁcients of the
original Eq. (8.3).
It follows that partially symmetric expressions in the roots taking k values, poly-
nomial equations of degree k obtained from the original equation, and subgroups of
the full permutation group Sn with an orbit of order k and therefore of index n!/k in
Sn are intimately related.

Lagrange (1770)

Lagrange (1770)
Lagrange was the ﬁrst to suspect that the quintic might not be solvable by radicals.
His analysis hinged on the construction of intermediate expressions which he called
resolvents; we shall need to consider their deﬁnition and their worth.
It may help to start with an example that is almost too elementary, the quadratic
equation
aX2 + bX + c = 0,
whose roots are, of course,
−b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
.
If we denote the roots by x and y then the only quantity in the solution formula
that is not a rational expression in the coefﬁcients is the square root, which is this
expression in terms of the roots of the equation:

b2 −4ac = a(x −y).
This is not symmetric in the roots, but it is rational in the roots.
The merit in thinking this way does not become clear until we turn to cubic
equations. We denote the roots by x, y, and z, and the solution formula involves a
square root, as we have just seen:
q
2
2
+
p

3
= (x −y)(y −z)(z −x)
6√−3
and, as the expression on the right shows, it too is rational in the roots of the
given cubic equation. Indeed, that expression takes only two values as the roots are
permuted, so, by the remark about partially symmetric expressions, it must satisfy
a quadratic equation, which is why it can be expressed as a square root involving
the coefﬁcients of the equation. Lagrange’s insight was that this is crucial to the
existence of solutions of the cubic and suggestive of an approach that might work
for equations of higher degree (or show that no such approach exists).
To understand Lagrange’s approach, set s = x +αy +α2z and t = x +αz+α2y,
where α is a primitive cube root of 1: α3 = 1. The expressions s and t are what are
called Lagrange resolvents (Lagrange called them réduite or reduced) and each of
them take 6 values as x, y, z are permuted.3 However,
s3 = x3 + y3 + z3 + 6xyz + 3(x2y + y2z + z2x)α + 3(xy2 + yz2 + zx2)α2,
3We assume for the present that these quantities do not vanish.

86

Is the Quintic Unsolvable?
and there is a similar expression for t3 (write it down). So s3 + t3 = A and s3t3 =
B are both invariant under all 6 permutations of x, y, z, and so they are rational
expressions in a, b, and c, the coefﬁcients of the cubic equation. This means that s3
and t3 are the roots of a quadratic equation
X2 −AX + B = 0
with coefﬁcients that are rational in a, b, c. This equation is called a resolvent
equation, and it means that s3 and t3 can be found from the coefﬁcients of the
original equation by nothing more than the taking of a square root.
To obtain the quadratic equation more systematically we proceed as follows.
Denote the elements of S3 by g0 = e, g1, . . . , g5, and write gjs for the effect of the
permutation gj on s; for example, (23)s = t. Write down the equation of degree 6
5

j=0
(X −gjs) = 0.
This is a symmetrical expression in the permutations of x, y, z in s and so therefore
are the coefﬁcients in the equation. Now it turns out that this equation of degree 6 is
in fact this quadratic equation in X3:
(X3 −s3)(X3 −t3) = 0.
So (and here we get closer to Lagrange) we can start with the cubic equation,
obtain a quadratic equation whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of the coefﬁ-
cients of the cubic equation, pick a solution of that quadratic equation (say s3), and
take its cube root: the resulting expression will be of the form s = x + yα + zα2, a
rational expression in the roots of the given cubic equation. Do the same with t, and
we have the three equations
x + y + z = −a
x + αy + α2z = s
x + α2y + αz = t
from which the roots x, y, z can be found (one has to check that the correct choice
of cube roots has been made).
So the value of a Lagrange resolvent is that on the one hand knowing it enables
all the roots of the cubic equation to be found, and on the other hand it can be found
from a polynomial of degree two whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of the
coefﬁcients of the cubic equation we want to solve. This suggests that there might be
a programme to solve a polynomial equation of arbitrary degree n: ﬁnd a resolvent
(an expression in the roots and roots of unity) that satisﬁes a resolvent equation of

8.3
Lagrange (1770)
87
degree less than n whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of the coefﬁcients of the
equation we want to solve. If we solve this equation, we ﬁnd the roots of the equation
we want to solve. So the question becomes: can we ﬁnd a Lagrange resolvent? All
that we know initially is that it must have some sort of symmetric property—but
that’s rather vague.
Lagrange on the Solution of the Quartic Equation
We can now sketch Lagrange’s very lengthy analysis of the quartic equation4
x4 + mx3 + nx2 + px + q = 0
(8.5)
with roots a, b, c, d. He began with an account of Ferrari’s method. To deal with the
correct choices of signs, he argued that the radical expression for the roots satisﬁed
an equation of degree 12 that, as he showed after a long calculation ending on p. 261,
was of the form
(x4 + mx3 + nx2 + px + q)3 = 0.
Lagrange then focussed on the fact that Ferrari’s method depends on the
introduction of an auxiliary cubic equation. He let y be a root of that cubic equation,
and introduced a variable z so that he could put the quartic equation (8.5) in the form
(x2 + mn
2 + y)2 −z2

x + my −p
2z2
2
= 0.
This is a difference of two squares, and so he deduced that two of the roots of the
quartic satisfy one of the next two equations, and the other two roots satisfy the
other equation, whatever root, y, of the cubic equation is chosen:
x2 + mx
2 + y + z

x + my −p
2z2

= 0
(8.6)
x2 + mx
2 + y −z

x + my −p
2z2

= 0.
(8.7)
Without any loss of generality, the ﬁrst one gave him expressions for a + b and ab,
and the second one for c + d and cd. From these he deduced that
z = c + d −a −b
2
, y = ab + cd
2
.
4See pp. 254–305 of the Oeuvres edition.

88

Is the Quintic Unsolvable?
He noted that the expression for y had precisely 3 values:
ab + cd
2
, ac + bd
2
, ad + bc
2
,
and he now argued very much as follows.
To eliminate unnecessary fractions, Lagrange worked with 2y = ab + cd rather
than y. Symmetry considerations dictate that the three values of 2y, which are
u = ab + cd, v = ac + bd, w = ad + bc,
are the roots of a cubic equation with rational coefﬁcients:
u3 −Au2 + Bu −C = 0,
in which A, B, and C are expressions in a, b, c, d.
It is easy to see that A = u + v + w = n, and a little more work to discover that
B = uv + vw + wu = mp −4q,
and
C = uvw = (m2 −4n)q + p2.
This implies that u, v, and w are the roots of the cubic equation
z3 −nz2 + (mq −4q)z + (m2 −4n)q + p2 = 0.
(8.8)
In the special case where m = 0 u, v, and w are the roots of the equation
z3 −nz2 −4qz −4nq + p2 = 0,
(8.9)
and so y = u/2, v/2, and w/2 satisfy the equation
8z3 −4nz2 −8qz −4nq + p2 = 0.
This is the equation just found above, and so we deduce that the roots of Eq. (8.8)
are
α = 1
2(tu + vw), β = 1
2(tv + uw), γ = 1
2(tw + uv).
But it reduces when we adjoin λ and μ, which are as follows:
λ = ±

2y −p, μ = ±

y2 −r.

89
Now we get

(x2 + α) + (λx + μ)
 
(x2 + α) −(λx + μ)

= 0.
The roots of each factor are simply found by taking the appropriate square roots.
Lagrange indeed showed explicitly that if u = ab + cd is given then, because
abcd = q, the quantities ab and cd are the roots of
t2 −ut + q = 0.
He pursued this line of argument to the end, and showed that the roots of the quartic
are expressible in terms of
t1 = (a + b −c −d)2, t1 = (a + c −b −d)2, t1 = (a + d −b −c)2,
as

.
Lagrange pointed out that it is not necessary to take care of the signs so long as they
are chosen in the fashion indicated. Other choices of sign give the negatives of the
roots.
Lagrange looked at all the known methods for solving the quartic equation, and
showed that they all depended on the existence of partially symmetric functions of
the roots. He then summarised his ﬁndings in these words (Lagrange 1770/71, 304):
We have not only brought together these different methods and shown their connection and
interdependence, but we have also – and this is the main point – given the reason, a priori,
why some of them lead to resolvents of degree three and others to resolvents of degree six
that can be reduced to degree three. This is due, in general, to the fact that the roots of these
resolvents are functions of the quantities t, u, v, w, which, like the function tu + vw, take
on just three values under all the permutations of these four quantities; or which, like the
function t +u−v −w, take on six values that are pairwise equal but have opposite signs; or
which take on six values that can be separated into three pairs such that the sum or product
of the values in each pair is not changed by the permutations of the quantities t, u, v, w
. . . . The general solution of quartic equations depends uniquely on the existence of such
functions.

Is the Quintic Unsolvable?
Lagrange then looked for a generalisation of this method to the case of quintic
equations. He was aware that there was not much of a pattern to draw on. The
quartic equation particularly was only solved by some happy accidents, because the
equation of degree 6 that arose could in fact be solved. To solve a quintic equation,
in Lagrange’s opinion, one would write down the equation satisﬁed by an expression
of the form
x + yα + zα2 + wα3 + vα4,
where α is a primitive 5th root of unity. This equation would break up into equations
of degree 24—but what then? On the one hand, this equation of degree 24 is special,
but why should it be a disguised equation of degree some factor of 24? One might
hope that, because the cyclic group of order 5 sits inside the symmetry group of the
pentagon (call it P5, a group of order 10) one could bring that equation down to
order 12, using
x + yα + zα2 + wα3 + vα4, and its conjugate x + yα4 + zα3 + wα2 + vα.
Perhaps this could be connected to the alternating group A5 in S5, which surely
involves nothing more than square roots of the discriminant 
i<j(xi −xj), and
indeed P5 is even a subgroup of A5. But it is of index 6 in A5 and there is no
subgroup in between. Even this analysis surpasses what Lagrange could have done,
but his is the credit for suspecting that in any case the quintic polynomial equation
cannot be solved by radicals.
He expressed his somewhat downbeat conclusions this way (Lagrange 1770/71,
403):
Here, if I am not mistaken, are the true principles for the solution of equations and for the
best analysis of its conduct. As one can see, everything reduces to a kind of combinatorial
calculus by which one ﬁnds a priori the results to be expected. It may seem reasonable to
apply these principles to equations of the ﬁfth and higher degrees, of which the solution is
at present unknown, but such application requires too large a number of examinations and
combinations whose success is very much in doubt. Thus, for the time being, we must give
up this work. We hope to be able to return to it at another time. At this point we shall be
satisﬁed with having set forth the foundations of a theory which appears to us to be new and
general.
In fact, Lagrange never returned to the topic and his next long paper on the topic
of solving equations was on the method of ﬁnding numerical approximations to their
roots, which some historians have suggested is further evidence that he despaired of
solving the quintic algebraically. In fact, such an approach is consistent with the
belief that even if the equations can be solved by radicals the solution expressions
would be unintelligible, as the example of the cubic equation has already suggested.

Exercises
Lagrange did not think of groups of permutations in any sense—that idea came
later, as we shall see—but in terms of expressions taking not many different values
as its variables are permuted. The next exercises are designed to help you explore
this piece of mathematics, to which we shall return. After Lagrange, mathematicians
interested in the problem of solving the quintic equation became interested in ﬁnding
functions (algebraic expressions) in 2, 3, or 4 symbols taking not many values. For
example, the expression u+2v takes two values when u and v are permuted, u+2v
and v + 2u, but the expressions u + v and uv take only one value each: u + v =
v + u, uv = vu.
1. Find expressions in symbols u, v and w that take respectively 1, 2, 3, 6 values
when u, v and w are permuted. [Solutions: uvw, or any other symmetric
expression, such as u + v + w; (u −v)(v −w)(w −u); for example, (u −v)2;
u + 2v + 3w.]
2. Find expressions in symbols u, v, w and t that take respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
12 values when u, v, w and t are permuted.
3. What has this got to do with subgroups of S2, S3, S4 respectively? For example,
what permutations of u, v, w do not alter the value of (u −v)(v −w)(w −u).
It may help to point out what only becomes clear after the work of Galois, when
we, but not Lagrange, look for answers in the properties of the group S4—that we do
so is a measure of the depth and success of Galois’s insight. The alternating group
A4 is generated by three-cycles, the pairwise products of the transpositions, such as
(123) = (13)(12). There are many subgroups of order 4, we single out this one:
H4 = {e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(32)},
which later became known as the Klein group. The group we obtained that permutes
the roots t, u, v, w but leaves each of u, v, and w ﬁxed as well as the discriminant of
the quartic is the Klein group. So adjoining the roots of the cubic equation found by
Ferrari corresponds to passing to the Klein group in the chain of subgroups of S4.
This group still acts transitively on the roots, so even with these quantities adjoined
the equation remains irreducible.
It is interesting to compare this with Camille Jordan’s account, contained in the
ﬁrst treatment of the subject that fully appreciated Galois’s ideas, and which was
published exactly a century later, in 1870.5 (We shall look at Jordan’s work in more
detail later, see Chap.13.)

Is the Quintic Unsolvable?
Let x1, x2, x3, x4 be its roots; H the group of order 8 obtained from the substitutions
(x1, x2), (x3, x4), (x1, x3)(x2, x4). A function ϕ1 of the roots of the given equation and
invariant under the substitutions of H depends on an equation of the third degree (§366).
This solved, the group of the given equation reduces to a group K obtained from those
of its substitutions which are common to the group H and its transforms by the various
substitutions of G. One sees easily that these common substitutions are the four obtained
from (x1, x2)(x3, x4), (x1, x3)(x2, x4). But these substitutions commute with the subgroup
H ′ of order 2, obtained from the powers of (x1, x2)(x3, x4). Therefore a function of the
roots that is invariant under the substitutions of H ′ only actually depends on an equation
of the second degree. This solved, the group of the given equation reduces to H ′. This
equation then decomposes into two equations of the second degree, having respectively for
roots x1, x2 and x3, x4 (§357). It is enough, moreover, to solve one of these equations to
reduce the group of the given equation to the identity.
Among the various functions that one can take for ϕ1, the most convenient is the function
(x1 + x2 −x3 −x4)2 adopted by Lagrange. One easily ﬁnds the coefﬁcients of the equation
of degree 3 on which it depends:
Y 3 −(3p2 −8q)Y 2 + (3p4 −16p2q + 16q2 + 16pr −64s)Y −(p3 −4pq + 8r)2 = 0.
Let v1, v2, v3 be its roots, one has
x1 + x2 −x3 −x4 = √v1; x1 −x2 + x3 −x4 = √v2;
x1 −x2 −x3 + x4 = √v3; x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = −p;
whence
x1 = 1

√v3 = (x1 + x2 −x3 −x4)(x1 −x2 + x3 −x4)(x1 −x2 −x3 + x4)

3. A Remark on the Symmetric Polynomials
A polynomial in the n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn is said to be symmetric if its value
is unaltered by any permutation of the variables. Thus when n = 3 the polynomial
x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 is symmetric but the polynomial x2
1 + x2
2 −x2
3 is not—it is altered in
value by the permutation that exchanges x2 and x3, for example.
The basic symmetric polynomials are σ1 = x1 + x2 + · · · xn, σ2 = x1x2 +
x1x3 + · · · + xn−1xn, ...σn = x1x2 . . . xn. It is a fundamental fact about symmetric
polynomials that any symmetric polynomial can be written as a sum of the basic
symmetric polynomials, and indeed in a unique way (up to order).
It is well known that the coefﬁcients of the polynomial in the equation xn +
a1xn−1 + · · · + an = 0 are given, up to a sign, by the basic symmetric polynomials
in the roots x1, x2, . . . , xn of the equation: aj = (−1)jσj. Newton stated, without
proof, that the powers of the roots are symmetric in the roots, and this was proved
by Maclaurin. The more general claim—the ‘fundamental fact’—was stated and
proved by Waring, and then by Lagrange (1808, Note VI). Here I give the very
elegant proof due to Gauss (1816).
Gauss imposed an ordering on the variables: xj comes before xk if j comes
before k. So x3 comes after x2 and before x5, for example. Let us call this an
alphabetical ordering. Gauss extended it to an ordering on monomials of the same
degree, essentially by writing out each monomial in full (writing, for example,
x4
1x2
2x3 as x1x1x1x1x2x2x3) and applying alphabetic order to them. In this way the
polynomial can be written as a sum of terms of each degree, each sum arranged in
alphabetical order.
It will be enough to deal with polynomials all of whose monomials are of
the same degree, because Gauss’s process works with each degree separately. So
suppose that the monomials in a symmetric polynomial p in x1, x2, . . . , xn of degree
n are arranged in alphabetical order. If it contains the monomial x4
2x2
5x1 then it must
contain all monomials of the form x4
j x2
kxl, because it is symmetric, and so it contains
x4
1x2
2x3, which is the one that comes ﬁrst in the ordering among terms of this form.
Suppose moreover that this is the term that comes ﬁrst in the alphabetical ordering
on the polynomials. Now consider the polynomial
p −σ 2
1 σ2σ3.

8.5
Revision on the Solution of Equations by Radicals

It is symmetric, and it contains no term of degree 7 of the form x4
j x2
kxl or any term
that comes earlier in the alphabetical ordering. The polynomial p is ﬁnite, so a
ﬁnite number of operations of this form reduce it to a sum of the basic symmetric
polynomials, as required.
To see that the decomposition into a sum of the basic symmetric polynomials is
unique, suppose that it was not, and that the polynomial p is obtained in distinct
ways as these polynomials in the basic symmetric polynomials: F(σ1, σ2, . . . , σn)
and G(σ1, σ2, . . . , σn). Then F −G represents the zero polynomial. Apply alpha-
betical ordering to the variables σ1, σ2, . . . , σn and look at the ﬁrst monomial of
top degree. It cannot be equal to any other monomial, because, when written out in
x1, x2, . . . , xn it contains some terms not found in any other monomial. Therefore
F = G and the representation is unique.

Chapter 9
The Unsolvability of the Quintic
9.1
Introduction
The other momentous advance in algebra around 1800 was the discovery that the
quintic equation cannot be solved by an algebraic formula. How can a negative of
this kind be proved? What is it to analyse how a problem can be solved? The two
mathematicians who did this are Rufﬁni and Abel, with a little help from Cauchy.
Before we look at their work—and Abel’s in particular—let us consider what it is
to solve an equation algebraically.
We have a polynomial equation
a(x) = xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0,
(9.1)
with rational coefﬁcients, which we shall assume is irreducible and has no repeated
roots.
We suppose we have found an “auxiliary” polynomial, a1(x) = 0, whose roots
we know; say they are α1, α2, . . . , αk and we adjoin them to the rational numbers,
so the ﬁeld extension of Q we are working with, call it K1, consists of rational
expressions in α1, α2, . . . , αk. These are quotients of one polynomial in the αs
divided by another, so they are expressions that are algebraic in the rational numbers
and the coefﬁcients of the auxiliary polynomial.
We now repeat this procedure with a second auxiliary polynomial whose
coefﬁcients are in K1 and obtain a new ﬁeld, K2, and carry on doing this until we
obtain a ﬁeld that contains the roots of the polynomial equation we want to solve,
a(x) = 0.
For this to count as solving the original equation, we require that the auxiliary
polynomials be easier to solve that the original equation (else we can ‘solve’ the
equation in one step by letting a(x) = 0 be its own auxiliary polynomial!). For it
to count as a procedure that solves the original equation by radicals, we stipulate

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
that every auxiliary equation be of the form tn −p = 0 for some n, where p is an
element of the ﬁeld we are extending. We say that the new number p1/n is adjoined
to the ﬁeld. (The exponent n can vary from step to step, but we can always assume
that it is prime because an extension obtained from tmn −p = 0 can be regarded
as an extension obtained from tm −p = 0 followed by an extension obtained from
tn −p1/m = 0.)
We also insist that the roots of the original polynomial a(x) = 0 are obtained
after ﬁnitely many steps, and also that the ﬁeld we reach in this way is the smallest
ﬁeld containing the roots and not some larger one. The solution methods for cubic
and quartic equations conform to this picture if we allow that in the case of the
irreducible cubic, the procedure leads via the adjunction of a complex cube root of
unity to a real subﬁeld.
9.2
Rufﬁni’s Contributions
It is one thing to suspect that something cannot be done in mathematics, even to
have good reasons to be suspicious, but another to prove that it cannot be done.
The ﬁrst to attempt a proof that the general quintic equation cannot be solved by
radicals was the Italian mathematician Paolo Rufﬁni. His proof was not accepted by
most mathematicians at the time, and historians and mathematicians have disagreed
ever since about how small or large are the gaps in his arguments.1 He published
his ideas in a two-volume book in 1799 and a number of later papers in which
he rebutted the objections of Malfatti, who could not accept Rufﬁni’s negative
conclusion, and adopted the suggestions of his friend Abbati, who accepted the
proof of unsolvability and made some simpliﬁcations.2
For reasons of brevity I forgo a detailed discussion, but draw attention to one
notable feature of Rufﬁni’s work: the explicit attention to families of permutations.
Rufﬁni established that there was no Lagrange resolvent for the general quintic
equation that itself satisﬁed an equation of degree less than 5. Nor could such a
resolvent be found that satisﬁed a pure quintic (an equation of the form x5 −α = 0)
if the resolvent were to be rational in the roots of the original equation. He succeeded
by focussing on the sets of permutations that can arise, which sets he called
permutazione, and we can think of as permutation groups. He divided them into
various types, such as transitive and intransitive. If a function of n roots is left
invariant by p permutations then Rufﬁni called p the degree of equality—it is
the order of the permutation group that leaves the function invariant, and he noted
without proof that p divides n!. In particular, he described all the subgroups of S5,
and on the basis of this concluded correctly that there are no subgroups of S5 of
orders 15, 30, or 40. Therefore, there are no functions of 5 variables having only 8,
1See (Kiernan 1971) and for a careful and sympathetic modernised account (Ayoub 1980).
2The most thorough account of Rufﬁni’s work remains (Burkhardt 1892).

9.3
Abel’s Work

4, or 3 values. Abbati’s contribution was to reach the same conclusions with a more
systematic method. Rufﬁni also proved that if a subgroup of the permutations on
ﬁve objects has an order divisible by 5 then it has an element of order 5.
Rufﬁni’s success was in transferring the question of solvability by radicals
from the question about adjoining successive roots (which was a question about
the existence of resolvents) to a question about the corresponding families of
permutations that ﬁx the newly adjoined elements, and then largely dealing with
the new question by an exhaustive analysis of these families.
That said, there were obscurities in Rufﬁni’s work. He never made it clear if what
are called accessory irrationals must be adjoined, such as complex roots of unity—
these are elements that lie outside the smallest ﬁeld containing the roots. Recall that
this seemed to be necessary when solving a cubic with all its roots real (and indeed it
is). Therefore Rufﬁni was unclear about whether successive adjunctions of radicals
must end exactly in the smallest ﬁeld containing the roots of a given quintic, or
merely contain it—in fact containment is enough, and strict equality is not required.
Sylow commented that Rufﬁni assumed with insufﬁcient proof that the radicals in
any solution must be rational in the roots of the given equation.3 More damagingly,
his book was long and frequently obscure, and it met with a poor reception outside
Italy, with the exception of Cauchy, who strongly endorsed it.4 I will explain at the
end of this chapter why the obscurities in Rufﬁni’s work matter mathematically, but
the most likely explanation for its poor reception was its novelty and its great length,
rather than any failing it might have to modern eyes.
Rufﬁni’s approach was soon to be superseded by that of Niels Henrik Abel, who
accomplished in a few pages what Rufﬁni had taken two volumes to do. Abel wrote
in posthumously published memoir that
The ﬁrst and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the
impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Rufﬁni.
But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difﬁcult to determine the validity of his
argument. It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying.5
However, it is not clear if Abel knew of Rufﬁni’s work at all when he published his
own accounts in 1824 and 1826.
9.3
Abel’s Work
When Abel began his work on the solvability of the quintic, he initially thought he
had found a general formula, but on being challenged to use it to solve some sample
equations he realised that he had failed, and he became convinced instead that the

doctrine.

task cannot be done. His proof of this claim—that the quintic equation cannot be
solved by radicals—was one of the papers he took with him on his trip to Germany
and had published as a separate pamphlet at his own expense (it is (Abel 1824)).

When that account proved unconvincing, he wrote a second, (Abel 1826). In
it, Abel ﬁrst deﬁned some terms. He said that a function of some quantities is
rational if it is obtained by addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on these
quantities. If root extraction is also involved, he said that the function is algebraic.
Abel then considered what such a formula would look like if it existed. To set out
the theory in a general form, Abel began with an equation of degree k:
c0 + c1y + c2y2 + · · · + ck−1yk−1 + yk = 0.
(9.2)
He then supposed that the last step in implementing such a formula would be the
taking of nth roots, i.e. solving the equation
zn −p = 0,
where p is a known quantity, and n is a prime number. Then the roots of
equation (9.2) will have the form
y = q0 + p1/n + q2p2/n + · · · + qn−1p(n−1)/n,

9.3
Abel’s Work
101
where the qs are numbers we have obtained already, probably as a consequence of
earlier adjunctions. We can even write, as Abel did,
y = p0 + R1/m + p2R2/m + · · · + pm−1R(m−1)/m,
by replacing R with R/pm
1 , but nothing much is gained by doing so.
The qs have also been obtained by adjoining nth roots, perhaps with other values
of n, so they are also of this form. If we steadily unpack each of the qs and p
we eventually reach expressions that only involve the coefﬁcients of the equation,
which are, of course, symmetric functions of the roots. But ﬁrst Abel showed that at
each stage what is adjoined cannot also satisfy an equation of degree n −1 (for the
appropriate n).
Abel put his expression for a root, y, into Eq. (9.2) and argued (in Sect. 9.2 of
his paper) that if we expand it out and collect like terms the equation reduces to
something of this form:
r0 + r1p1/n + r2p2/n + · · · + rn−1p(n−1)/n = 0,
where the rs are rational functions in p and the qs and the coefﬁcients of Eq. (9.2).
Now, for this to be true, he said, we must have
r0 = 0, r1 = 0, . . . , rn−1 = 0.
This is true because we are assuming (and it can be proved) that p1/n satisﬁes an
irreducible equation of degree n, namely zn−p = 0. If it also satisﬁes an equation of
degree n −1 then all the coefﬁcients of that equation must be zero. The argument is
ﬁddly, and I omit it, but the basic idea is to derive a contradiction from the existence
of common roots. Care must be taken because the equations cannot be assumed in
advance to be irreducible.
Abel now introduced a primitive nth root of unity, α, and noted that the values of
y which are obtained when p1/n is replaced by αjp1/n, j = 0, 1, . . . n −1, are also
roots of the equation. This is because it satisﬁes the equation
r0 + r1αp1/n + r2α2p2/n + · · · + rn−1αn−1p(n−1)/n = 0,
which is zero because the rj are all zero.
Let us denote the value of y corresponding to p1/n by y1, the value of y
corresponding to αp1/n by y2, and generally the value of y corresponding to αjp1/n
by yj+1. We have just seen that y1, y2, . . . , yn are n roots of Eq. (9.2).

102
9
The Unsolvability of the Quintic
So Abel now had a system of n equations for the n values of nth roots:
y1 = q0 + p1/n + q2p2/n + · · · + qn−1p(n−1)/n,
y2 = q0 + αp1/n + α2q2p2/n + · · · + αn−1qn−1p(n−1)/n,
. . . ,
yn = q0 + αn−1p1/n + q2p2/n + · · · + αqn−1p(n−1)/n.
This system can be solved, yielding the qjpj/ns as linear functions of the ys and
powers of α. So the qs that enter the formula for the solution are rational functions
of the roots of the equation. In fact
qj = nj−1 y1 + α−jy2 + · · · + α−(n−1)jyn
(y1 + α−1y2 + · · · + α−(n−1)yn)j .
An exactly similar argument, which Abel barely bothered to write down, then
establishes that at every stage what is adjoined is a rational function of the roots of
the original equation. He concluded that
[Abel’s theorem on the form of a solution] If an equation is solvable by radicals one can
always put one root in such a form that all the algebraic functions of which it is composed
can be expressed as rational functions of the roots of the given equation
To understand this remark, see that it is true when the given equation is a cubic. A
root of a cubic equation is a sum of two cube roots (each multiplied by a cube root of
unity) each of which contains a term rational in the coefﬁcients of the cubic equation
to which is added or subtracted a square root of a term that is itself rational in the
roots of the equation. What is at stake here is the ﬁrst strictly algebraic expression
with which the formula begins (the one deepest inside the nested roots). It is a radical
in the coefﬁcients, but a rational function in the roots (typically 
j<k(xj −xk)) and
some roots of unity.
In Sect. 9.4, Abel turned to the quintic equation, and concluded his proof as
follows: Take the ﬁrst of these intervening expressions—again, that means the
ﬁrst symmetric expression in the coefﬁcients that is subjected to root extraction.
There must be one, else multi-valued functions of the roots could not arise. Call
it v = R1/m (if need be by relabelling), where R is a rational function of the
coefﬁcients, v is a rational function of the roots, and m, which need not be 5, is
a prime number. Let the roots be considered as independent variables. As they are
permuted R does not change and R1/m takes m different values. So m must divide
5!, and by a recent theorem of Cauchy, which Abel had discussed in Sect. 9.3 of
his paper, this forces m = 2 or m = 5 because m is prime. Abel now showed that
neither alternative is coherent. You can consult the details in a subsection below, but
it is enough to know for our purposes that Abel succeeded in this matter.

9.3
Abel’s Work
103
Abel added an ‘Analysis of the preceding memoir’ to the paper when it was
republished in a French journal (as (Abel 1826)). Usually these things were quite
short: Abel added almost 7 pages to his 21-page memoir. He now observed explicitly
that an algebraic function will be of the form p′ = f (x1, x2, . . . , p1/m1
1
, p1/m2
2
, . . .),
where f is a rational function, the pj are rational functions of x1, x2, . . ., and the
nj are prime numbers. Such a function Abel called algebraic of the ﬁrst order; a
function is algebraic of the second order if it had a ﬁrst-order algebraic function as
one of its variables, and so on. A function of order μ is of degree m if it has m
functions of that order. Such a function can be written in the form
v = q0 + p1/n + q2p2/n + · · · + qn−1pn−1/n.
The ﬁrst theorem follows (Abel 1826, p. 88):
Every algebraic function of order μ and degree m can be written in the above form, where
n is prime, the qs are algebraic functions of order μ and degree at most m −1, p is an
algebraic function of order μ−1 and p1/m cannot be written as a rational function of p and
the qs.
This theorem says that the solution to a polynomial equation, written as a function
of the roots, will have the above form.
Abel then summarised his paper at some length until he reached the theorem
quoted above (Abel’s theorem on the form of a solution), which he stated again.
Then, with a nod to Cauchy’s work, he obtained his third theorem (Abel 1826, p. 90):
[Abel’s third theorem] If a rational function of x1, x2, . . . takes m different values one can
always ﬁnd an equation of degree m whose coefﬁcients are symmetric functions of the
x1, x2, . . . that has these m values as its roots, but it is impossible to ﬁnd an equation of
lower degree having one or more of these values as its roots.
On the basis of these general results he now redescribed his proof that the quintic
is not solvable by radicals. Certainly there must be a ﬁrst-order algebraic function
involved, say v = R1/m, where R is a rational function of the coefﬁcients of the
given quintic equation and m is a prime number. Because v takes m values as the
roots of the quintic are permuted, it must be that m divides 5! and so either m = 2, 3
or 5. Cauchy’s work ruled out the case m = 3. Abel then excluded each of these
cases, as in the memoir itself. He concluded that the general quintic equation was
not solvable by radicals, and that therefore the general equation of any degree higher
than 5 was not solvable by radicals either.
It is a great moment in the history of mathematics, but there are reasons for
disquiet. The paper is genuinely not easy to understand; not when it was published,
and not now because it does not translate nicely into modern ‘Galois theory’.6 It is
probably clear that it does not imply that the quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
are not solvable by radicals, but why does it not prove that no quintic equation is
solvable by radicals? What is meant by the phrase the ‘general quintic equation’?
Kiernan’s comments here are also illuminating. He remarked that
By a lengthy computational argument, Abel concludes that every expression, rational in ﬁve
quantities and assuming ﬁve distinct values, must be of the form
r0 + rlx + r2x2 + r3x3 + r4x4
where r0, r1, r2, r3, r4 are expressions symmetric in the ﬁve quantities, and where x is some
one of the ﬁve quantities. This passage, fully one-fourth of the entire article in length, has
been the most controversial part of the presentation. The results are established by direct
computation, [. . . ] Sylow’s comment on Abel’s proof is quite appropriate: “It must be
admitted that it could be shorter and clearer; but its validity is free of any serious objection.”7
Among Abel’s other remarks about equations that are solvable by radicals is his
short paper (Abel 1829) in which he established that if the roots of an irreducible
equation are such that all are rationally known when any one of them, say x, is,
and if θx and θ1x are any two of these roots and θθ1x = θ1θx then the equation
is solvable by radicals. Moreover, if the degree of the equation is pn1
1 pn2
2 . . . pnk
k
where p1, p2, . . . , pn are distinct primes, then the solution of the equation reduces
to the solution of n1 equations of degree p1, n2 equations of degree p2, ...and nk
equations of degree pk. In modern terms, this is the claim that an equation whose
Galois group is commutative then the equation is solvable by radicals, and it is the
paper from which the term ‘Abelian’ for a commutative group is derived, following
(Kronecker 1853).

Wantzel on Two Classical Problems
We now look at the discovery of the (nowadays) celebrated impossibility theorems
that follow from Galois theory: it is impossible by straightedge and circle to trisect
an arbitrary angle or to ﬁnd the side of a cube double the volume of a given cube.
These are two of the so-called three classical problems of Greek geometry:
1. the duplication of a cube: ﬁnding a cube equal in volume to twice a given cube
by straightedge and circle alone (solve x3 = 2);
2. trisect an angle by straightedge and circle alone (solve 4x3 −3x −s = 0);
3. ﬁnd by straightedge and circle alone a square equal in area to a given circle [i.e.,
disc] (construct a segment of length √π).
The last of these is very deep, but the ﬁrst two are usually taught today as
elementary consequences of Galois theory. What does that involve, and how were
they discovered?

Wantzel on Two Classical Problems
105
It turns out that the history of the three classical problems is complicated. It is
clear that they were only some of a number of unsolved problems around the time
of Plato; another asked for the construction of a regular heptagon, for example. On
the other hand, it is not clear what made them difﬁcult. It was known from early
on that the cube can be duplicated by a construction involving the intersection of a
hyperbola and a parabola. Later, Archimedes gave a construction for trisecting an
angle, but it involves sliding a marked straightedge around while ensuring that it
passes through a given point. The restriction to the use of a straightedge and circle
alone is implied but nowhere absolutely stated; it gained weight from the absence
of any other kind of ‘instrument’ in Euclid’s Elements, but that may be irrelevant.
Finally, no-one disputes (or disputed) that there is an angle one-third the size of a
given one, or that there is a cube twice the size of a given one—the only question
was how to exhibit the answer by a reliable procedure. Squaring the circle was
regarded as impossible from very early on, and remains to this day a synonym for
impossibility.
Nonetheless, the idea spread that these three problems could not be solved.
Here we shall look only at duplicating the cube and trisecting the angle. It is not
difﬁcult to persuade yourself that a straightedge and circle construction can only
involve rational operations on known lengths and the extraction of square roots.
Descartes spelled out explicitly in his La Géométrie of 1637 that straightedge and
circle constructions provide solutions to quadratic equations (Fig. 9.2).
To solve the equation z2 = az+b2, Descartes drew a right-angled triangle NLM
with LM = b and NL = a/2. He extended the hypotenuse NM to meet the circle

through L with centre at N at O and P, so NL = NP = NO. By the Pythagorean
theorem,

So
MN =

4a2 + b2 and OM = ON + NM = 1

Descartes went on to claim that cubic problems cannot be solved this way. His
argument was that circles and lines give us one number between two others, and
cubic problems required two. This is either a deep insight or a triviality blind to the
complexities of the problem; neither way is it a solution. In the next century Jean-
Étienne Montucla, the founder of the history of mathematics, gave a better argument
(Montucla 1754, pp. 273–285).8 He argued that algebraic constructions correspond
to ﬁnding intersection points of curves. By a traditional result (Bezout’s theorem)
a curve of degree k and a curve of degree m meet in km points (possibly complex,
possibly at inﬁnity, possibly multiple and counted accordingly). Repeated use of
quadratics will (might?) solve equations of degree a power of 2, but only those, and
therefore cubics cannot be solved.
Our two classical problems ask whether quadratic methods can solve cubic
equations (to phrase them in a way current since the sixteenth century). The
consensus by 1800, and probably all along, was that the answer was No. That answer
is correct, and we can ask: Who ﬁrst established this result?
The answer is a French mathematician, Pierre Laurent Wantzel, who published
his demonstration in 1837, when he was 23, in the journal Journal des mathé-
matiques. Wantzel promptly vanished into obscurity, however, from which he has
only recently been rescued by the Danish historian of mathematics Jesper Lützen
(see (Lützen 2009)).9 This gives us two questions: What did Wantzel do, and why
did it fall dead from the press?
Wantzel’s paper was in four parts. First he translated the geometric problem into
an algebraic one. Second, he showed that in this way the solution to the geometric
problem appears as a root of an equation of degree a power of 2. Third, under
certain further assumptions, this equation is irreducible. Fourth, duplicating a cube
and trisecting an angle lead in general to irreducible cubic equations—and therefore
cannot be solved by a sequence of quadratics.
The ﬁrst two of these arguments are unproblematic. Wantzel’s proof of step
three was deﬁcient. He needed the irreducibility of the polynomial P of degree 2n
8For a further discussion, see (Lützen 2009).
9There was one earlier mention, by Petersen, a Danish mathematician in 1877, but no-one picked
it up except Felix Klein, who dropped the reference to Wantzel by name. The ﬁrst historian of
mathematician to mention Wantzel by name was Florian Cajori in 1918.

107
and rational coefﬁcients because any algebraic number is the root of a polynomial
of degree a power of 2—just add the necessary extra roots (but get, of course, a
reducible polynomial). Moreover, Wantzel was interested in only one root of his
polynomial P of degree 2n but he has made many choices on the way—he had to
show his claim was independent of these choices. He did his best. He succeeded in
showing that if P has a root in common with another polynomial, F, with rational
coefﬁcients then all of the roots of P are roots of F. But this does not show that P
is irreducible, only that it is a power of an irreducible polynomial. However, it turns
out that this gap in Wantzel’s argument is easy enough to ﬁx (Pedersen and Klein
did so).
Mistakes in mathematics make an interesting subject. There are a lot of them,
even in published mathematics, certainly in the nineteenth century. They range from
the trivial (the reader can readily identify them and correct them) through those that
destroy the given proof of a claim but where the claim can be proved in another
way, to the irretrievably wrong. They have a historical dimension: ‘wrong by the
standards of the day’ is not the same as ‘wrong by our standards’—generally the
former implies the latter. Wantzel’s argument needs rescue, but good readers could
and did supply it.
So why did Wantzel not become famous? He published an original result in
a major journal while still a student in a main-stream place. He was even quite
well-known, being the ﬁrst student to come top in the entrance examinations for
both the École Polytechnique and the École Normale Supérièure. Lützen has two
interesting explanations. The ﬁrst is that perhaps the result was already thought to
be true. Gauss had claimed in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae §366 that the only
polygons constructible by straightedge and circle have 2np1p2 . . . sides, where the
pi are distinct Fermat primes. This implies in particular that the regular 9-gon is not
constructible, but its sides subtend an angle of 40◦at the centre, which is one-third
of the constructible angle of 120◦. Therefore angles cannot, in general, be trisected
by straight edge and circle.
Gauss wrote
In general therefore in order to be able to divide the circle geometrically into N
parts, N must be 2 or a higher power of 2, or a prime number of the form 2m + 1,
or the product of several prime numbers of this form, or the product of one or
several such primes times 2 or a higher power of 2. In brief, it is required that
N involve no odd prime factor that is not of the form 2m + 1 nor any prime
factor of the form 2m + 1 more than once. The following are the 38 values of N
below
300:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60, 64.68,
80, 85, 96, 102, 120, 128, 136, 160, 170, 192, 204, 240, 255, 256, 257, 272.
These are the closing words of the book, so they are oddly prominent—they might
be read as the conclusion of the book—and it is true that Gauss’s claim was not
accompanied by a proof, only a hint that the construction of other regular polygons
required that some irreducible equations be reducible. But nor is there any evidence
that anyone doubted it, and nor has anyone doubted that Gauss knew how to prove
the claim. So to anyone persuaded of Gauss’s claim Wantzel was saying nothing

108

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
new.10 Such a reader could have found Wantzel’s paper little more than a spelling
out of ideas and methods published a generation before by Gauss.
Lützen’s second argument is that perhaps the result was simply not found to be
interesting. Readers could argue that this merely conﬁrmed what they had suspected
all along: two of the classical problems are, after all, insoluble. So what? What can
be done with an impossibility proof? Nothing. On the other hand, the equations
are indisputably solvable—why care about a requirement that they be solved in
a particular and frankly old-fashioned way. A number of mathematicians (Gauss
himself, Abel, and on another topic Liouville) phrased the problem in a more
positive way: Look for a solution of such-and-such a kind, and if we fail prove
there is no solution of that kind, then look for solutions of another kind.
Lützen points out that Wantzel, however, had a liking for negative results. He was
one of the ﬁrst to publish a simpliﬁcation of Abel’s proof that the quintic cannot be
solved by radicals, and his simpliﬁcation was adopted by Joseph Serret in his Cours
d’algèbre ((1849) and subsequent editions). Wantzel was also the ﬁrst to prove that
if a cubic equation with rational coefﬁcients and all its roots are real then necessarily
any expression for the roots in terms of radicals will involve complex numbers.
Our interest in this result is because it ﬁts in nicely with our understanding of
Galois theory, a topic unknown to Wantzel and his readers. More broadly, it ﬁts
into a whole range of topics where we are interested in solutions of various kinds
and solution methods of various kinds. Impossibility results have become positive
results in mathematics—but they were not seen positively in 1837.
Wantzel, it seems from the one article on his life by someone who knew him, did
not live up to his early promise. He was unwilling to stick at any one topic for long,
was given a heavy teaching load, abused coffee and opium, and died in 1848 aged
only 33, his work already forgotten.
9.5
Wantzel on the Irreducible Case of the Cubic
In 1843 Wantzel published an explanation of why the irreducible cubic equation
with three real roots cannot be solved by the extraction of real roots alone.
He began with a classiﬁcation of irrationals or adjoined quantities that was, as
he said, close to Abel’s. He said that a number obtained by adjoining to the rational
numbers a root of an equation of the form xm1 −a = 0, where m1 is prime, is of
type 1; a number obtained by adjoining to numbers that are rational or of type 1 a
root of an equation of the form xm2 −a = 0, where m2 is prime, is of type 2, and
so on.
10There is also another claimant: Abel. But what he said on the subject was in an unpublished
fragment not discovered until 1839, two years after Wantzel published his paper; Wantzel cannot
have known of Abel’s claim.

9.5
Wantzel on the Irreducible Case of the Cubic
109
He then supposed he had an irreducible cubic equation with three real roots,
x0, x1, x2. The root x0 is of type n say, and satisﬁes an equation of the form
x0 = A + Bu + · · · + Mum−1,
where u =
m√a, a is of type n −1, and A, B, . . . , M are of type at most n and if
of type n then of lower degree than x0. Moreover, we can assume without loss of
generality that B ± 1.
The expression for x0 takes m values as the m roots of the equation um −a = 0
are substituted for u, and all these values of x0 are roots of the given cubic. So m
equals 2 or 3.
If m = 3 then the possible values of u are u, αu, α2u, where α3 = 1. So
x0 = A ± u + Bu2,
x1 = A ± αu + Bα2u2,
x2 = A ± α2u + Bαu2,
and therefore
x0 + αx1 + α2x2 = ±3u.
But α and α2 are conjugate imaginaries, and x0, x1, x2 and u are real, so x1 = x2.
But this contradicts the assumption that the cubic equation is irreducible.
Wantzel then argued that if m = 2 then x0 = A + √a and so x1 = A −√a
and x0 + x1 = 2A. So 2A is a root of a new cubic equation, which has as its roots
the pairwise sums of the given equation, is also irreducible, and does not have a
rational root (but A is of either lower degree or lower type than x0). The argument
that was applied to x0 applies also to 2A, and can be repeated to provide a sequence
of radicals of decreasing type and degree until it produces a single radical of the
form A′ +
√
a′, but this satisﬁes a quadratic equation and therefore cannot satisfy
an irreducible cubic equation.
He therefore concluded that
It is impossible to express in real roots alone the roots of an equation of degree three when
all its roots are real.
Applied to the irreducible cubic equation x3 + ax + b = 0 with three real roots,
x0, x1, x2 Wantzel’s argument produces 2A = −x2, because x0 + x1 + x2 = 0 so
the new cubic equation has roots −x0, −x1, −x2 and is x3 + ax −b = 0. Repeating
this argument returns the original cubic equation x3 + ax + b = 0, so there is no
decreasing sequence, as Wantzel required. He would have done better to argue that
if the roots are of type m then they are of type m −1 and ultimately are quadratic
extensions and cannot be roots of a cubic equation.

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
However, the insight that each extension being of degree 2 no subﬁeld of degree
3 can be produced is valid. We would say today that a tower of quadratic equations
produces a ﬁeld extension of degree 2m for some m and so no such tower can contain
an element that generates an extension of the rationals of degree 3.

2. What other negative results of that kind can you ﬁnd that were known by or
derived during the 1830s. Consider, for example, Fourier series representations
of a function, the Taylor series representations of a function, non-Euclidean
geometry and the parallel postulate.
Appendix A: Abel on the Cases m = 5 and m = 2
This account summarises (Rosen 1995).
Abel proceeded in two steps: ﬁrst he showed that a ﬁeld F that contains all the
roots of a polynomial and is contained in a radical tower can be the top of a radical
tower—this is the gap in Rufﬁni’s analysis. Second, he showed that for polynomials
of degree 5 no such ﬁeld F is the top of a radical tower.
If m = 5 then we can write
R1/5 = v = r0 + r1x + r2x2 + · · · + r4x4,
where the rs are symmetric functions in the roots x1, . . . , x5 and
x = s0 + s1R1/5 + s2R2/5 + s3R3/5 + s4R4/5.
As before, one deduces that
s1r1/5 = 1
5(x1 + α4x2 + α3x3 + α2x4 + αx5).

But this is impossible, because s1R1/5 takes only 5 values as the roots are permuted,
but the expression on the right-hand side takes 120 values.11
The case m = 2 is a little longer to treat. We now have
R1/2 = p + qs, where s =

(yi −yj)
and p and q are symmetric functions of the roots. Indeed, we also have −

Abel noted that (α2 −β2s2) is symmetric and claimed that rr1 = (α2 −β2s2)1/m

r1r2 has 4 values, which is impossible. But if rr1 is symmetric, say rr1 = v, then

version published in Crelle’s Journal in 1826.

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
Then coefﬁcients Aj are rational functions in the coefﬁcients and therefore symmet-
ric functions in the roots. To Abel, at least, the equation was “evidently” irreducible.
Therefore there are m values for the pj and therefore also m = 5. It follows by the
now-familiar argument, on noting that

that an expression of the form t1R1/5 on the one hand takes 10 values (5 for the
ﬁve roots, 2 for the square root) and on the other hand takes 120 values. This
contradiction concludes the paper.
It seems to me that Abel did not argue that the best-possible resolvent is not up to
the task (say, by showing that it only solves a restricted class of quintic equations),
rather, he showed that no suitable resolvent exists, and he did so via the theory of
permutations.
I conclude with some remarks about the principal obscurity in Rufﬁni’s work,
which Abel dealt with. The element α = 2 cos(2π/7) satisﬁes the polynomial
equation
x3 + x2 −2x −1 = 0,
which is irreducible over Q, the ﬁeld of rational numbers. Over the ﬁeld Q(α) the
polynomial splits completely, but the extension Q : Q(α) is not a radical extension
because the polynomial is not a pure cubic.
On the other hand, Abel proved that if a ﬁeld K contains enough roots of unity
(think of it as Q with such roots of unity adjoined) and f (x) is a polynomial with
its coefﬁcients in the ﬁeld K, then the smallest ﬁeld L that contains all the roots of
f (x) will arise in a sequence of radical extensions. In symbols, let
Q < K < · · · < Ej < Ej+1 < · · · < En
be a chain of radical extensions, and suppose that En−1 < L < En. Then in fact
L = En.
So in the presence of enough roots of unity a ﬁeld contained in a chain of radical
extensions is a radical extension itself, but without the appropriate roots of unity this
is not necessarily the case. In particular, in the presence of enough roots of unity an
extension of degree 5 must be obtained as a pure ﬁfth root. This opened the way
for Abel to concentrate on the case where the ﬁeld with the roots of an irreducible
quintic adjoined is precisely the top of a chain of radical extensions, and to show
that this was impossible.
I omit the proofs, which will be found in (Rosen 1995) in the language of Galois
theory.

Appendix B: Cauchy’s Theory of Permutation Groups
Fig. 9.3 Augustin Louis
Cauchy (1789–1857)
Cauchy’s work was done in two phases, the ﬁrst between 1812 and 1815 and the
second around 1844–45. We have already seen that his work in the ﬁrst phase, which
was quite possibly inspired by the work of Rufﬁni, helped Abel to prove that the
general quintic equation is not solvable by radicals. Now we look at it in a little
more detail.
In his paper (1815) Sur le nombre, etc (the full title is very long!) Cauchy took up
the question of how many different values a rational expression in n variables can
take when its variables are permuted in every possible way. He noted that Lagrange,
Vandermonde, and above all and more recently his co-religionist Rufﬁni had shown
that it was not always possible to ﬁnd a polynomial which took a speciﬁed number
of distinct values (even a number of values that divided n!, which is obviously
necessary). Rufﬁni had shown that it is not possible to ﬁnd a function of n = 5
variables that took only 3 or 4 values. Cauchy now produced the more general
theorem for Sn that was mentioned above.
In 1844, Cauchy returned to the theme, for reasons it is interesting to speculate
about (as we shall below). His treatment now was much more systematic. He
spoke of an arrangement of n symbols, and a ‘substitution’ or permutation as a
transition from one arrangement to another. He introduced the permutation notation
(x, y, z), the product of two permutations, the idea that forming the product of two
permutations is not necessarily commutative, powers of a permutation, the identity
permutation (written 1 and called a unity), the degree or order of a permutation (the
lowest positive power of it that is equal to 1). He then introduced the cyclic notation,
and the idea of similar permutations (ghg−1). The modern word is ‘conjugate’,
but Cauchy reserved that word for another concept, namely the idea of a group
deﬁned (generated) by a set of permutations—which he called a system of conjugate
substitutions. He then proved that

114

The Unsolvability of the Quintic
The order of a system of conjugate substitutions in n variables is always a divisor of the
number N of arrangements that one can make with these variables.
Here N = n!. Cauchy also proved that the order of any element of this group divides
the order of the group.
Cauchy also smuggled in the concept of a normal subgroup, although without
referring to Galois’s proper decompositions, and established a partial converse to
Lagrange’s theorem in his (1844, 250), when he showed that if a prime p divides
the order of a group then there is an element of order p in that group and so a
subgroup of order p. Recall that the condition that p be prime is necessary: there is
no subgroup of order 6 in A4 although 6|12 = |A4|. I omit a summary of Cauchy’s
proof.

Galois’s Theory
serious mathematics at the age of 15 by his teacher H.J. Vernier. He was completely
captivated, and quickly began to read advanced works: Legendre’s Géométrie and
possibly Lagrange’s Traité de la Résolution des équations numériques de tous les
degrés (‘The Resolution of Algebraic Equations’) in its augmented second edition
of 1808. Vernier was understandably delighted with his work, but other teachers
reported that he was increasingly withdrawn, “singular”, and even “bizarre.” He
insisted on taking the entrance exam to the nearby École Polytechnique a year
early, but he failed, which deepened his dislike of authority. He then entered the
advanced class at the Collège de Louis-le-Grand, where he had the good fortune to
be taught by L.P.E. Richard, who immediately recognised Galois’s brilliance, and
called on the École Polytechnique to accept the young man without examination.
They declined, but with Richard’s encouragement Galois published his ﬁrst paper
(on number theory) in the 1828 issue of Gergonne’s Annales de mathématiques. In
1829 he wrote his ﬁrst papers on the solvability of equations of prime degree, and
on 25 May and 1 June he submitted them to the Académie des Sciences. Cauchy
was appointed to write a report on them.
Then the dangerous world of French politics caught up with him. Galois’s father
was the innocent victim of a politically inspired plot against him organised by the
local priest, and committed suicide on 2 July 1829. Within days of this blow Évariste
sat the entrance exam for the École Polytechnique, but he failed again, and now
had no choice but to sit for what was then the lesser college, the École Normale
Supérieure, which he did in November 1829. This time he passed. Cauchy then
failed to report on Galois’s work, perhaps because he thought that Galois should
re-work his papers as an entry for the Grand Prize in Mathematics organised by the
Academy (for which the closing date was March 1, 1830). At all events, Galois did
submit just such an entry in February. But in May Fourier, the permanent Secretary
of the Academy and chief judge of the competition, died and Galois’s paper could
not be found. Galois felt convinced that he was the victim of an establishment
conspiracy—a reasonable opinion in the circumstances (even if wrong, as it may
well have been)—and moved steadily towards the revolutionary left (Fig. 10.2).
Three more articles by Galois soon appeared in Ferussac’s Bulletin, but the
political events of 1830 were more important. The Bourbon monarch Charles X
ﬂed from France after 3 days of rioting in Paris, and the Orleanist King Louis-
Philippe was installed in his place (Cauchy followed Charles X voluntarily into exile
in September). The students of the École Polytechnique played a prominent role in
these affairs, but the students of the École Normale, Galois included, were locked
in by Guigniault, the head of the school. Galois took up with the revolutionaries
Blanqui and Raspail, and by the end of the year Guigniault expelled him.
Galois threw himself into the revolutionary politics that had returned to Paris
almost with the fervour of the 1790s. On 9 May 1831 he attended a militantly
republican dinner called to celebrate the acquittal of 19 republicans on conspiracy

charges.2 About two hundred people were there, including the novelist Alexandre
Dumas, who later wrote3:
It would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd in all Paris two hundred persons more hostile to the government
than those to be found re-united at ﬁve o’clock in the afternoon in the long hall on the
ground ﬂoor about the garden [of the Vendanges des Bourgogne].
Dumas went on:
Suddenly, in the midst of a private conversation which I was conducting with the person
on my left, the name Louis-Philippe, followed by ﬁve or six whistles caught my ear . . . A
young man who had raised his glass and held an open dagger in the same hand was trying
to make himself heard. He was Évariste Galois, . . . . All I could perceive was that there was
a threat and that the name of Louis-Philippe had been mentioned; the intention was made
clear by the open knife.
2At this time political assemblies were banned, so dinners were a popular, and legal, substitute.

Galois’s Theory
Dumas escaped, but Galois was arrested the next day and put on trial on June 15
for threatening the King’s life. He was acquitted, and within a month he appeared
on Bastille Day dressed in the uniform of the banned Artillery Guard. This was
interpreted as an extreme act of deﬁance—he was carrying several weapons—and
he was arrested again, and eventually sentenced, on 23 October, to 6 months in the
prison of Sainte-Pélagie. The eminent botanist and fellow republican Raspail, who
was to spend 27 months in prison between 1830 and 1836 was among his fellow-
prisoners.4 Raspail recorded a moment in prison on 25 July 1831 when Galois,
taunted by his fellow prisoners, had become drunk after emptying a bottle of brandy
at a single draught, and exclaimed5:
You do not get drunk, you are serious and a friend of the poor. But what is happening to my
body? I have two men inside me, and unfortunately I can guess who is going to overcome
the other . . . And I tell you I will die in a duel on the occasion of a worthless coquette. Why?
Because she will invite me to avenge her honour which another has compromised.
The Academy now rejected another manuscript by Galois, who turned his back
on the usual places for a mathematician to publish and arranged to have his work
published by Auguste Chevalier, a friend of his who belonged to the proto-socialist
Saint-Simonian movement inspired by Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-
Simon. On 29 April 1832, he left prison. A month later he wrote letters to friends
sketching what he had achieved in mathematics, and on the morning of the 30th of
May he went to his fatal duel. Shot in the abdomen, he died in hospital the day after,
still only 20 years old. Politics marked his life, although it may not have caused his
death as some authors suggest, but his funeral was the occasion for a republican
demonstration that sparked off a week of rioting.
Galois’s papers, those already in print and those left in manuscript, were
eventually published in 1846, as will be described below. They run to 60 pages
of text, and in addition to an early published paper on the theory of equations there
are papers on continued fractions and the curvature of curves in space. The letter he
wrote to Chevalier is reproduced, followed by what is now called the ﬁrst memoir—
Sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux (‘On the conditions
for the solvability of equations by radicals’)—and the second memoir (presented
as a fragment): Des équations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux (‘Primitive
equations that are solvable by radicals’).
We shall be concerned here only with the letter to Chevalier, the ﬁrst memoir,
and a paper on several overlapping topics entitled Analyse d’un Mémoire sur la
résolution algébrique des équations (‘Analysis of a memoir on the algebraic solution
of equations’) that Galois published in 1830. For the second memoir the reader
should consult the careful analysis in (Neumann 2006). So this account marginalises
the concept of primitivity, which Jordan was to take up and which remains important

life a militant republican. A boulevard and a metro stop in Paris are named after him.

to this day, and indeed it will scatter its remarks about (Galois 1830) to later chapters
(in particular, Chap. 23).
Galois did not become famous for showing that the quintic equation cannot
be solved by radicals. That was already known. It was also known, as Lagrange
had demonstrated, that all cyclotomic polynomials of prime degree are solvable by
radicals. What Galois did was to give a general theory concerning which equations
of whatever degree can be solved algebraically—and, of course, he showed how the
quintic equation ﬁtted into his very general account.
As Neumann observes, we cannot be sure what Galois read because he cited
very few sources. It would seem that he read Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,
presumably in the French translation, from the occasional references to Gauss and
because there is no other relevant work by Gauss. We can presume that he read
some classic works under the inﬂuence of Louis Richard, his teacher in the ﬁnal
years at school, who appreciated Galois’s brilliance, but we cannot be sure which.
It is likely that he read several works by Lagrange, but we do not know precisely
which. Neumann (p. 393) says of the posthumous third edition of (Lagrange 1808)
that it “is the one that Galois would probably have read”. If he did read that work,
he would have found in Note XIII an account of the various methods for solving
equations of degree less than ﬁve, but when it came to the quintic equation only the
remark that its resolvent was of degree six, and so it was useless to proceed further.
The circumstances in which Galois wrote his memoir, and his early and surely
needless death at the age of 20, make this a difﬁcult memoir to understand. Our
(historians’) task is to understand the memoir as well as it could have been in its
day, and to that end any present-day knowledge is welcome. It is not a historian’s
task to misunderstand it, to make it say what it does not, to supply alien formulations
(such as present-day ones when they are signiﬁcantly different), to cover up gaps by
explaining them away. This is because we have not only the mathematics before us,
which we do not wish to fail to understand, but also the historical events that, as
historians interested in the development of mathematics, we wish to understand.
The historical facts are these. No-one took up Galois’s ideas when they were
ﬁrst, and it must be said, obscurely published. They were published in 1846 to only
slightly better effect, and then gradually became intelligible through the work of
a number of ﬁrst-rate mathematicians. We shall trace this slow progress over the
course of the next several chapters. It cannot therefore be the case that what he
wrote was easy by the standards and with the methods of the 1830s.
Could it be that what he wrote is easy by the standards of today? Have
mathematicians as it were built the structure that holds his insights together? Can
we read his memoir and, given the right background in modern algebra, simply
recognise this or that piece of our theory that he, remarkably, foresaw? Such a state
of affairs is surely unlikely—but one can imagine that what he wrote acted as a
challenge to ﬁll in the gaps. However, the situation, as we shall see, is that what he
wrote was reworked, not merely written out (much) more fully. Understanding how
this was done is the task of the historian of algebra.

Galois’s Theory
What then are we to make of this, our ﬁrst meeting with Galois’s work? We can
take the view that though he had done his best to present the complete resolution
of the question: ‘When is a polynomial equation solvable by radicals?’ what we
can see are pieces of this resolution, key pieces presumably, but we don’t ﬁnd them
convincing. Either they are not all here, or there is something about them that we
don’t see. There is a way of thinking about the problem that Galois presented, and
which we don’t follow. Is that because he was too quick, in which case patient work
should enable us to catch up, or is there some deep insight he has failed to present?
10.2
Galois’s 1st Memoir
Galois began by explaining that one can always use any rational function of the
coefﬁcients of a polynomial equation to form the coefﬁcients of new polynomials,
and one may adjoin, as he put it, the nth roots of numbers as needed.6
He then deﬁned a permutation on n symbols to be any arrangement of them—
what we would call an arrangement—and a substitution as the passage from one
permutation to another—what we would call a permutation! To minimise the risk of
confusion, I shall use Galois’s terms, but in italics. His terminology is the reason the
later development of ﬁnite group theory concerned itself with substitution groups.
But it must be said that he used the words inconsistently.
His use of the term ‘group’, however, calls for further comment. Galois spoke
of groups of permutations and groups of substitutions. By a group of substitutions
he meant a collection of substitutions closed under composition, and since his
collections were always ﬁnite this makes a group of substitutions a group in the
modern sense. By a group of permutations he meant a collection of arrangements
with the property that the substitutions that turn any given permutation into any other
form a group of substitutions. Neumann (2011, p. 22) observes that Galois was not
only inconsistent in his use of these two terms, although the context usually makes
matters clear, he gradually came to attach more theoretical weight to the concept of
a group of substitutions. Because the concept is emerging here I will also put the
word ‘group’ in italics when discussing Galois’s Mémoire.
Galois said that the following results were well known7:
1. An irreducible equation cannot have any root in common with a rational equation
without dividing it.
2. Given an arbitrary equation which has no equal roots, of which the roots are
a, b, c, . . ., one can always form a function V of these roots, such that none of
the values that are obtained by permuting the roots in this function in all possible

Galois (2011), and also in Edwards, Galois Theory.

ways will be equal. For example, one can take
V = Aa + Bb + Cc + · · · ,
A, B, C, . . . being suitably chosen whole numbers.
3. The function V being chosen as is indicated in the preceding article, it will
enjoy the property that all the roots of the proposed equation will be rationally
expressible as a function of V .
4. (Known, he said, to Abel and stated in his posthumous memoir on elliptic
functions): Let us suppose that the equation in V has been formed, and that one of
its irreducible factors has been taken so that V is a root of an irreducible equation.
Let V, V ′, V ′′, . . . be the roots of this irreducible equation. If a = f (V ) is one
of the roots of the proposed equation, f (V ′) will also be one of the roots of the
proposed equation.
Let us look brieﬂy at these claims. The ﬁrst says that if an irreducible polynomial
f (x) has a root in common with another polynomial h(x) then f (x) divides h(x).
It is proved by applying the Euclidean algorithm to the two polynomials.
The second is proved informally this way. Denote the roots of the polynomial
by x1, x2, . . . , xn. There are n! expressions of the form a1xn + · · · + anxn for
each choice of the integer coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an. It is enough to check that
the coefﬁcients can be chosen so that a1x1 + · · · + anxn never equals one of
its permutations (the general case reduces to this one by relabelling the roots).
An equality between a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn and one of its permutations (say
a1x2 + a2x1 + · · · + anxn), is a linear condition on the coefﬁcients a1, a2, . . . , an.
This eliminates a one-dimensional subspace of Zn, the space of n-tuples of integers,
because the roots are assumed to be distinct and not rational. There are at most n!
equations of this kind, and it is enough to choose a1, a2, . . . , an from Zn with these
one-dimensional subspaces removed, which is clearly non-empty.
In more modern terms, the third claim says that we have the given equation,
f (x) = 0, which we take to be irreducible of order n over some ﬁxed extension
ﬁeld K of the rational numbers that contains all the roots of unity we shall want,
and having n distinct roots, x1, . . . , xn. We have the group Sn, and an element V =
a1x1 + · · · + anxn for suitable integers a1, . . . , an with the property that V is what
we call a primitive element of the splitting ﬁeld for the given equation—that is, we
adjoin it and we adjoin all the roots of the given equation, which is to say all the
roots are rational functions of this single V . We denote the n! values of V under the
action of Sn by V = v1, V2, . . . , Vn!. Denote the polynomial
(X −V1)(X −V2) · · · (X −Vn!)
by F(X) and suppose it factors as F
= G1G2 . . . Gk, each factor Gj being
irreducible over the ﬁeld K.
The group of the equation f (x) = 0 is obtained as follows. Let G be one of the
irreducible factors of F above, of degree d, say. Then the splitting ﬁeld of f (x) is

122
10
Galois’s Theory
the simple extension of K obtained by adjoining a root of G. Because G is of order
d there are d permutations of the roots that map the roots of G among themselves.
The third claim says that all the roots of the equation are expressible as
rational functions of V , and is harder to understand than the ﬁrst two. Edwards
(1984, pp. 43–44) notes that Poisson commented that “The proof of this lemma is
insufﬁcient”, but that it could be established using some speciﬁc ideas introduced
by Lagrange. Galois gave an argument to this effect that can be sketched as
follows. For, if V = φ(x1, . . . , xn) and g ∈Sn−1, denote by gφ(x1, . . . , xn) =
φ(x1, g(x2), . . . , g(xn))—here the subgroup Sn−1 acts on x2, . . . , xn leaving x1
ﬁxed. Now consider the expression 
g∈Sn−1(V −gφ) as a function of x1, given
by the equation F(V, x1) = 0. It is symmetric in the variables x2, . . . , xn and so it
can be written as a polynomial in x1 of degree (n −1)!. The root x1 is a common
root of this equation and the given one.8
Let us take the case of an irreducible cubic equation, say
x3 + ax2 + bx + c = 0,
with roots u, v, w. We have the equations
u + v + w = −a, uv + vw + wu = b, uvw = −c,
to which we now add the equation
u + kv + mw = V.
Galois asks us to consider the expression V ′ = u + kw + mv, and the product (I’ve
momentarily replaced his v by a more neutral symbol t)
(t −V )(t −V ′) = (t −u + kv + mw)(t −u + kw + mv).
This is symmetric in v and w, so expanded out as a polynomial in t it becomes
something of the form
t2 −σ1(v, w)t + σ2(v, w).
Now plainly the equation (t −V )(t −V ′) = 0 has V as a root, so the equation
t2 −σ1(v, w)t + σ2(v, w) = 0 regarded as an equation in u has u as a root. But u
is a root of our original cubic equation, so u is a result of the remainder on dividing
the cubic equation by this quadratic one, but that remainder is linear, so u is rational
in a, b, c, and V . Galois’s claim is that this argument works in general.
8What has to be shown is that x1 is the only root of the two equations, see (Edwards 1984, pp.
44–45).

10.2
Galois’s 1st Memoir
123
Galois gave this argument in support of the last of these claims: form the product

g∈Sn(V −gφ). This expression is divisible by the given equation, so V ′ is some
gϕ. Let F(V, x1) be as before [so we note that the product is here taken over all
g ∈Sn−1]. Now repeat the previous argument by combining the given equation and
F(V ′, b) = 0 to deduce b = f (V ′).
Galois now gave some results of his own, starting with this Theorem.9
Theorem (Galois’s Proposition I). Let an equation be given of which the m roots
are a, b, c, . . .. There will always be a group of permutationsof the letters a, b, c, . . .
which will enjoy the following property:
1. That every function invariant under the roots invariant under the substitutions of
this group will be rationally known;
2. Conversely, that every function of the roots that is rationally determinable will
be invariant under the substitutions.
He added the following note10:
Here we call invariant not only a function of which the form is invariant under the
substitutions of the roots among themselves, but also one whose numerical value will not
change under these substitutions. For example, if Fx = 0 is an equation, Fx is a function
of the roots which is not changed by any permutation.
When we say that a function is rationally known, we wish to say that its numerical value is
expressible as a rational function of the coefﬁcients of the equation and of some adjoined
quantities.
In other words, every equation with roots x1, . . . xm admits a group G with the
property that every G-invariant function is rationally known and conversely every
rationally known function is G-invariant. We must remember that the very concept
of a group was unknown at this stage, and Galois was introducing it here in terms
of permutations and substitutions.
Before sketching a proof, Galois observed that in the case of what he called
algebraic equations the group G is the group Sn of all permutations because
the rationally known functions are the symmetric functions.11 But, in the case of
the cyclotomic equation corresponding to an nth root of unity, the group is the
cyclic group of order n −1 (Galois tacitly assumed that n is prime here). This
points, albeit obscurely, to an important advance Galois made over Lagrange. Galois
formulated the theory so that it applied not to equations with arbitrary coefﬁcients
as parameters, but to all equations with numerical coefﬁcients (as, for example, the
cyclotomic equation). So the group he was directing attention to is speciﬁc to the
equation that is to be solved; it might be Sn or some subgroup. This is why he added
a footnote at this point to explain that a function is invariant if not only its form is
unaltered by the substitutions of the roots, but its numerical value does not alter.

11Edwards (1984, p. 54) explains that an “algebraic equation” is one with letters rather than
numbers as its coefﬁcients.

124
10
Galois’s Theory
Galois also added that he said a function is rationally known if its numerical value
is a rational function of the coefﬁcients of the given equation and any quantities so
far adjoined. This makes the concept a moving one, dependent on where we are in
the process of solving the equation.
The distinction between formal invariants and numerical invariants is worth
underlining, if only because later writers were not always clear. Consider the
equation x4 + 1 = 0, whose roots are (setting ε = eiπ/4)
x1 = ε, x2 = iε, x3 = −ε, and x4 = −iε.
The group for this equation turns out to be
{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)},
and the expression x1x2
2 + x3x4
4 is not formally invariant under this group, but its
numerical values are (they are zero).12
Galois now proved the theorem. He argued that there is a rational func-
tion V of the roots of the given equation such that every root of the given
equation is a rational function of V . Consider the irreducible equation satisﬁed
by V . Let V ′, V ′′, . . . V (k−1) be the roots of this irreducible equation and let
φ(V ), φ1(V ), . . . , φm−1(V ) be the roots of the given equation. Then the k sub-
stitutions of the roots obtained by sending V to V ′, V ′′, . . . , and V itself, and
simultaneously each φj(V ) to φj(V ′), φj(V ′′), . . . is the required group G.
Then came another theorem.13
Theorem (Galois’s Proposition II). If one adjoins to a given equation the root r
of an irreducible auxiliary equation,
1. one of two things will happen; either the group of the given equation will not be
changed, or it will be partitioned into p groups each belonging respectively to
the proposed equation when one adjoins to it each of the roots of the auxiliary
equation;
2. these groups will enjoy the remarkable property that one will pass from one to
another by operating on all the permutations of the ﬁrst with one and the same
substitution of letters.
This theorem is a casualty of the circumstances in which Galois wrote this
memoir. He struck out the statement that the number p is the degree of the auxiliary
equation, and failed to state that the partition is into j groups, where j divides p.
These groups are what we would call conjugate, and the substitutions will be H
and gHg−1 in the other. What Galois meant by writing “all the permutations are
12This example comes from (Bolza 1893, p. 99), which is Bolza’s review of the English translation
of (Netto 1882), see Sect. 15.

Galois’s 1st Memoir
125
obtained from the ﬁrst one by operating with one and the same substitution” is that
if the permutations of one are called H, the permutations in another will be called
gHg−1. In other words, if g is the substitution that relabels all the permutations (i.e.,
arrangements) in one group as the permutations in the other, then the corresponding
substitutions are related as h and ghg−1. His insight becomes clearer with an
example, such as the one provided in Sect. 10.5 at the end of this chapter. Missing
entirely at this point in the memoir is any discussion of the importance of H being
a normal subgroup; Galois dealt with that in his letter to Chevalier.
Galois’s insight is that a useful adjunction alters the group G of the given
equation, which it breaks up into p mutually conjugate subgroups of G, each
belonging to the original equation when the roots of the auxiliary equation are
adjoined. Moreover, these ‘groups’ are such that one passes from one to the next
by applying the same substitution to all the permutations of the ﬁrst—so the groups
are conjugate, as we would say. The given equation may, and usually will, remain
irreducible even with the new numbers adjoined.
Proof. (Here Galois wrote: “There is something to be completed in this proof. I
do not have the time.”) Either the original equation is still irreducible after the
adjunction, in which case its group does not change, or the equation becomes
reducible. In this case the equation for V breaks into j factors:
f (V, r) × f (V, r1) × · · · × f (V, rj−1),
where the other values of r are r1, . . . , rj−1.
Thus the group of the given equation also decomposes into groups, each
containing the same number of elements (permutations) because each value of V
corresponds to a permutation. These groups are those of the given equation as one
adjoins successively r, r1, . . . , rj−1.
Since all the values of V are rational functions of one another, if, say, V is a root
of f (V, r) = 0 and F(V ) another, then if V ′ is a root of f (V ′, r′) = 0 then F(V ′)
will be another. Here Galois added14
f (F(V ), r) = a function divisible by f (V, r).
Therefore (lemma 1)
f (F(V ′), r′) = a function divisible by f (V ′, r′).
Then came this theorem.15

126
10
Galois’s Theory
Theorem (Galois’s Proposition III). If one adjoins to an equation all the roots of
an auxiliary equation, the groups in question in Theorem II will enjoy the additional
property that the substitutions are the same in each group.
Galois could only note “One will ﬁnd the proof”. At this point, he has claimed
that all the subgroups obtained in Theorem II are the same, and the reduced group
of the equation is what we would call normal in the one before.
And then comes this theorem16:
Theorem (Galois’s Proposition IV). If one adjoins to an equation the numerical
value of a certain function of the roots, the group of the equation will be reduced
in such a way as not to have any other permutations than those under which this
function is invariant.
Galois now came to his fundamental question: “In what cases is an equation
solvable by simple radicals?” He began by saying
I shall observe to begin with that, to solve an equation, it is necessary to reduce its group
successively to the point where it does not contain more than a single permutation. For,
when an equation is solved, an arbitrary function of its roots is known, even when it is not
invariant under any permutation.
Certainly, he then argued, an equation solvable by simple radicals is such that
the group can be diminished to a group with a single element by adjoining a
suitable sequence of roots of prime degree. Conversely, if the group breaks up in
this fashion then the equation is solvable by simple radicals. One can suppose the
radicals that reduce the group are chosen to be of least degree at each stage, and one
can assume that such pth roots of unity as are necessary have been adjoined, for
they satisfy an irreducible equation of degree less than p. This follows, as Galois
said, from Gauss’s work on cyclotomic polynomials. Therefore, by Theorems II
and III, the group of an equation solvable by radicals must decompose, as he put
it, into p subgroups obtained one from the other by the same substitution and all
containing the same substitutions. Or, as we would say, there is a normal subgroup
of the original group of the equation of index p. Therefore the original group of the
equation must decompose into a sequence of smaller groups in this way, each group
of prime index in the one before.
Conversely, Galois went on, if the group decomposes in this fashion then there
is a sequence of adjunctions that brings the decomposition about. Galois sketched
a proof, which was obscurely worded (and at one point he wrote the exact opposite
of what he meant) and relies on the resolvent V . I omit the proof, which was to be
rescued by Jordan (see §518 of his Traité below).
Galois then indicated how this analysis held up in the case of quartic equations.
The group of the equation contains 24 substitutions and on adjoining a [suitable]
square root decomposes into two groups each of 12 substitutions. Galois listed
the elements of one of these groups: it is identical with what we call A4—the
16(Neumann 2011, p. 121), emphasis Galois’s.

10.2
Galois’s 1st Memoir
127
other is the coset of A4 in S4. This group splits into three groups, in line with
Galois’s second and third theorems on adjoining a radical of the third degree (a
cube root?). One of these is the group that came to be called a Klein group, K4 =
{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}, and it splits into two ‘groups’: {e, (12)(34)} and
{(13)(24), (14)(23)}—notice that this second ‘group’ is also just a coset of the
ﬁrst. Adjoining a square root isolates the group {e, (12)(34)}, which is resolved
by adjoining a square root.
Galois concluded by turning to the investigation of irreducible equations of prime
degree, p. Adjunction must start with a qth root for some prime q. But he did
not prove the unsolvability of the quintic by his general theory. Instead he gave
an argument which was a lot closer to the hints of Lagrange and, especially, the
methods of Abel.
First of all he asked: what is the group of an irreducible equation of prime
degree p if it is solvable by radicals? He answered his question by showing that
such an equation is either unaffected by the adjunction of a radical or it is reduced
completely. Therefore, in the reduction process, the last group reached before the
group with only one element must be a group of p elements, and by a result of
Cauchy’s this means the group must be the cyclic group of order p. The preceding
group to this one must be made up, Galois continued, of a certain number of groups
having the same substitutions as this one. Let me note that this makes sense; Galois
was alluding to the corresponding coset decomposition. Galois now labelled the
roots x0, x1, . . . , xp = x0 and considered what must happen to xk; it must go to
xf (k), and so one has
f (k + c) = f (k) + C,
where C is independent of k. Therefore
f (k + mc) = f (k) + mC,
and setting c = 1, k = 0 deduced that f (m) = am + b and so
f (k) = ak + b,
a and b being constants. This gave him the form of the next group up in the
decomposition (let me call it G).
Then Galois showed that the whole group of the equation must be the group just
found, and that a polynomial equation of prime degree is solvable by radicals if and
only if its group is of the form of the group G just found.
Now, this group has the property that once two of the roots of the corresponding
polynomial equation are known rationally, so are the rest. In other words, it acts
doubly transitively on the roots. In fact, as no substitution of the form
xk →xak+b

128
10
Galois’s Theory
other than the identity ﬁxes two elements it follows that once two roots are known
the rest are and the group of the equation reduces to the group with one element.
Galois now wrote down the group of the equations of degree 5 that are solvable
by radicals, listing all its 20 elements as permutations of 5 symbols.
To sum up: The smallest subgroup of the group of an irreducible equation of
prime degree must, by a result of Cauchy’s, contain p elements, and the only
subgroup of Sp of order p is the cyclic group of order p. Then
•
(A): the next group in the decomposition must act in this form (modulo p)
xk →xak+b.
•
(B): indeed, all substitutions of the group of the given equation must be of this
form.
•
(C): therefore, for the given equation to be solvable by radicals, it is necessary and
sufﬁcient that once any two roots are given all the others are rationally known.
This is not the case in S5, as the subgroup G20 of order 20 shows, which is
generated by (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and (2, 3, 5, 4).
10.3
From Galois’s Letter to Chevalier
From propositions II and III of the ﬁrst memoir, we perceive a great difference between
adjoining to an equation one of the roots of an auxiliary equation and adjoining all of them.
In both cases the group of the equation breaks up by the adjunction in sets such that one
passes from one to the other by the same substitution, but the condition that these sets have
the same substitutions holds with certainty only in the second case. This is called the proper
decomposition.
In other words, when a group G contains another H, the group G can be divided into sets,
each of which is obtained by multiplying the permutations of H by the same substitution;
so that
G = H + HS + HS′ + . . . .
And it can also be divided into sets which contain the same substitutions, so that
G = H + T H + T ′H + . . . .
These two methods of decomposition are usually not identical. When they are identical, the
decomposition is proper.
It is easy to see that when the group of an equation is not susceptible of any proper
decomposition, then, however, the equation be transformed, the groups of the transformed
equations will always have the same number of permutations.
On the other hand, when the group of an equation admits a proper decomposition, in which
it has been separated into M groups of N permutations, then we can solve the given equation
by means of two equations, one having a group of M permutations, the other N.

10.4
Exercises
129
When therefore we have exhausted in the group of an equation all the possible proper
decompositions, we shall arrive at groups which can be transformed, but whose permu-
tations will always be the same in number.
If each of these groups has a prime number of permutations, the equation will be solvable
by radicals; otherwise not.
The smallest number of permutations which an indecomposable group can have, when
this number is not a prime, is 5 · 4 · 3.
10.4
Exercises
As we have seen, Galois discussed which quintic equations are solvable by radicals
in terms of a group of order 20 that he introduced, and which is connected with
equations of the form x5 −a = 0, where a is a rational number that is not a
perfect ﬁfth power. These exercises relate to the much simpler, but similar story
that concerns cubic equations of the form x3 −a = 0, where a is any rational
number that is not a perfect cube. Without loss of generality, we shall assume that
a = 2.
The roots of the equation x3 −2 = 0 are ρ =
3√
2, ωρ, and ω2ρ, where ρ is the
real cube root of 2 and ω is a cube root of unity, for deﬁniteness ω = 1
2(−1 + i
√
3).
We are interested in the ﬁeld K = Q(ρ, ωρ, ω2ρ) that contains all the roots, and
the intermediate ﬁeld Q∗= Q(ω).
These roots may be permuted in six ways if we keep only the rational numbers
ﬁxed. Notice that any automorphism of the ﬁeld K that ﬁxes Q maps ρ to one of ρ,
ωρ, and ω2ρ because
2 = f (2) = f (ρ3) = (f (ρ))3,
so f (ρ) is a cube root of 2. Similarly, f (ω) must be a cube root of unity, and
therefore one of 1, ω, and ω2.
The transposition (ρ, ωρ) is given as this automorphism of the ﬁeld K that ﬁxes
Q:
f (ρ) = ωρ, f (ωρ) = ρ.
We ﬁnd that
ρ = f (ωρ) = f (ω)f (ρ) = ωnf (ρ) = ωn+1ρ,
for some integer n = 0, 1, or 2, so we must have n = 2. Therefore f (ω) = ω2.
We now check that f (ω2ρ) = ω2ρ, as required.
f (ω2ρ) = (f (ω))2f (ρ) = ω4ωρ = ω2ρ.

130

Galois’s Theory
1. Deﬁne the other transpositions (ρ, ω2ρ) and (ωρ, ω2ρ) explicitly.
2. The 3-cycles are also automorphisms of the ﬁeld K that ﬁx Q. One is given by
f (ρ) = ωρ, f (ωρ) = ω2ρ.
Check that f (ω) = ω and so f (ω2ρ) = ρ, as required.
3. Notice that this automorphism and its inverse are automorphisms of the ﬁeld K
that ﬁx Q∗. In terms of the groups of the equation, we have therefore shown that
Γ (K, Q) ∼= S3, and Γ (K, Q∗) ∼= A3 ∼= Z3.
4. Consider now the integers modulo 3, namely {0, 1, 2} and consider the maps
j →aj + b,
where a ∈{1, 2} and b ∈{0, 1, 2}. They form a group of order 6. The map
z →z+1 corresponds to the 3-cycle (0, 1, 2) and so generates a normal subgroup
of order 3, and the map j →aj is the transposition (1, 2). Find the maps of this
form corresponding to (0, 1) and (0, 2).
If we now associate 0 with ρ, 1 with ωρ, and 2 with ω2ρ then we obtain a new
representation of the group Γ (K, Q).
So if we ﬁrst adjoin ω to Q, to obtain Q∗, and then adjoin any root of the equation
x3 −2 = 0 we get the other roots automatically. This is an example of what was
later called a normal extension of Q∗by K. Notice that the group Γ (K, Q∗) is a
normal subgroup of the group Γ (K, Q).
However, if we adjoin a root, say ρ, to Q, to obtain Q(ρ) and then adjoin another
root, say ωρ to obtain K we ﬁnd that the group Γ (Q∗, Q(ρ)) is of order 2, and
the group Γ (Q(ρ), Q) is of order one! This indicates why non-normal extensions—
such as this one—are not productive.
10.5
A Cayley Table of a Normal Subgroup
The ﬁrst table below is a Cayley table for the group S3. Each row of it presents an
arrangement of the elements of the group, or, in Galois’s terminology, a permutation
of them. The passage from the top row to any other is obtained by multiplying the
elements in the top row on the left by the corresponding element on the left, thus
effecting what Galois called a substitution. What Galois noticed was that in the
case of a ‘normal’ subgroup H of a group G—to use modern terminology—one in
which gH = Hg for all g ∈G, the table forms into blocks that themselves can be
regarded as permutations and which act on each other to perform substitutions, as
in the second table, which is for the quotient group S3/A3.

Galois: Then, and Later
The bicentenary of Galois’s birth generated some valuable historical work that was
published in an issue of the Revue d’Histoire des Mathématiques. In a long article
(Boucard 2011) Jenny Boucard argues for Louis Poinsot as a missing link between
Gauss and Galois. Poinsot was known for his work on algebra and number theory,
and she ﬁnds a memoir of his in 1818 on polynomial congruences modulo a prime
and a previously unpublished work of his on permutations of 1820 indicative of a
coming together of these two ﬁelds.
Caroline Ehrhardt, in her (2011), traces Galois’s ideas from his day to the
modern period in an attempt to understand why they were eventually found to be so
exciting and how they transformed algebra in later generations. She notes, as we do
below, the difference between the neglect Galois’s ideas were met with in Galois’s
lifetime, and the much more positive response they got after their republication
in 1846, and she observes that while Serret promoted Galois’s ideas in the 1860s
in the spirit of classical algebra and the solution of equations, Jordan offered a
radically different interpretation that moved away from the solution of equations
and into the theory of groups that Jordan was trying to create. She further traces the
implications of this split as far as Picard’s republication of Galois’s papers in 1896.
This theme is pursued at greater length in (Brechenmacher 2011), a paper that looks
outside France at networks of texts associated with Kronecker, Klein, and Dickson.
Brechenmacher also ampliﬁes a theme in (Goldstein 2011) where the implications
of Galois’s work for Hermite were traced: the importance—going back indeed to
Abel—of Galois’s ideas for the theories of elliptic and abelian functions.17 This
issue is pursued in the next chapter and in Chap. 15.
17Some of these connections are also traced in (Bottazzini and Gray 2013).

Chapter 11
After Galois
11.1
Introduction
Galois’s theory was considered very difﬁcult in its day, and was also poorly pub-
lished. This chapter looks at what had to happen before it could become mainstream
mathematics, and how as it did so it changed ideas about what constitutes algebra
and started a move to create a theory of groups.
11.2
The Publication of Galois’s Work
Galois’s work did not pass entirely unnoticed in his lifetime, but what little was said
about it was not encouraging. The Academy of Sciences had commissioned a report
on Galois’s ﬁrst memoir by Poisson and Lacroix and it was submitted on 4 July
1831 (although signed only by Poisson).1 In it they observed that in a posthumously
published paper Abel had already claimed that
If three roots of an irreducible equation of prime degree are such that any one of these
roots can be expressed rationally in terms of the other two then the equation is solvable by
radicals.
They admitted that this differed from Galois’s theorem in that it asserted a sufﬁcient,
but not a necessary, condition for an equation to be solvable by radicals, but having
thus hinted that Galois’s work was not completely original they went on to disparage
its quality. They argued, reasonably enough, that even if the truth of Galois’s

principal theorem was admitted it was not possible to use the criterion in practice,
for
a condition of solvability, if it exists, must have an exterior character that one can verify by
inspecting the coefﬁcients of the given equation or at most by solving other equations of a
degree less than the degree of the given equation.
But, they went on
Be that as it may, we have made every effort to understand Galois’s demonstration. His
reasoning is neither sufﬁciently clear nor sufﬁciently developed for us to be able to judge
its correctness and we will not be in a state to give an idea of it in this report.
However, they said, the author intends to give a complete account, and often the
various parts of an extended work shed light on each other and make the whole
thing easier to understand than the isolated parts, so they recommended waiting until
the author publishes the whole work, when one might be able to reach a deﬁnitive
opinion, but until then they had to withhold any recommendation to publish it.
Nor did things improve after Galois’s death. The by-then elderly Sylvestre
Lacroix wrote in the sixth edition of his Compléments des Element d’Algèbre (1835,
382) that
In 1831 a young Frenchman, Évariste Galois, who died the following year, announced in
a paper presented to the Academy of Science that, “in order for an irreducible equation
of prime degree to be solvable by radicals, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that, once any
two of the roots are rationally known, the others can be determined from these by rational
operations.” But the memoir seemed, to the committee appointed to review it, to be very
nearly unintelligible.2
In 1843, Joseph Liouville announced to the Paris Academy of Sciences that he
had discovered among Galois’s unpublished papers a “solution which is both correct
and profound” to the problem of determining when an irreducible equation of prime
degree is solvable by radicals.3 Galois had died in 1832, and Liouville became
interested in Galois’s work when some friends of Galois brought it to his attention;
Liouville said that Chevalier had entrusted the manuscripts to him. It has been con-
jectured that the revival of interest in 1842 stemmed from the striking coincidence
that Galois’s school teacher, Louis Richard, who had been very impressed by Galois,
had acquired a second brilliant student, Charles Hermite, who rapidly attached him-
self to Liouville, and that this connection suggested an opportunity for the friends
of Galois. All of which makes it plausible that these people could have gone to
Liouville in the hope that he, through his own ability as a mathematician and as the

1846).

The Publication of Galois’s Work

editor of a major journal, could assist in doing justice to Galois. But it does not mean
that any of then had fully read or understood Galois’s ideas, and that seems unlikely.
Chevalier also prepared an annotated version of the ﬁrst of Galois’s memoirs,
and Liouville prepared it for publication in his journal in December 1843, only to
withdraw it at the last minute. His reasons remain unclear; did he ﬁnd a error, did
he decide to do Galois better justice? Whatever the reason, in 1846 he published a
longer account, including a fragment of another paper, the last letter to Chevalier,
and all of Galois’s previously published papers. The legend of Galois was born.
In 1843, when addressing the Academy, Liouville had admitted that Galois’s
memoir was difﬁcult and had promised to write a commentary elucidating it, but
in 1846 there was no commentary. Most likely, he had found it too hard to ﬁt in
the necessary study alongside all his other commitments. But he did offer a short
course of private lectures on Galois’s ideas—the date is uncertain but the winter of
1843–1844 is likely—which Serret attended. Unpublished notes by Liouville from
this period show that he had ﬁlled in the largest gaps in Galois’s sketchy exposition,
but it seems he never pulled them together into a systematic exposition. We know he
intended to, because Serret said so in his Cours d’Algèbre Supèrieure of 1849. Serret
was to go on to be a prominent exponent of Galois’s ideas in successive editions of
this book, but not in 1849 (Serret, by the way, was another student of Richard’s).
A detailed analysis of Liouville’s unpublished notes conducted by Lützen suggests
that the biggest problem Liouville had was adapting to the fundamentally group-
theoretic way of thinking in Galois’s work; Liouville adhered to Cauchy’s way
of thinking about rational functions and their values. This makes them closer to
Galois’s work than the twentieth century reworking of his theory, but mufﬂes the
insight all the same.
In a sense, therefore, Liouville’s inﬂuence on the rediscovery of Galois’s ideas
was indirect. He interested the young Joseph Bertrand in it, and when in 1845
Bertrand published a memoir on the classic topic of the number of values a function
of n variables can take as its variables are permuted, the referee was Cauchy
(reasonably enough). This fact alone would help explain why Cauchy returned to
the subject, but the announcement at the Academy in 1843 might well have done
the trick.
In one way, though, Liouville retarded the cause. By announcing his intention to
publish a commentary but never writing one Liouville made other people wait and
hold back from research they otherwise might have done. Serret was to wait 20 years
before ﬁnally publishing his own ideas, in the third edition of his Cours d’algèbre
supérieure, 1866. In Italy Enrico Betti eventually wrote his own commentary in
1851, but he still urged Liouville to publish his own.

11.3
Serret’s Cours d’Algèbre Supérieure
The third edition of Serret’s Cours has been described (Wussing 1984, p. 129) as
“The ﬁrst textbook-like presentation of Galois theory and, in particular, the earliest
algebra-oriented presentation of group theory”.4 As Wussing (1984, p. 130) went on
to note, Serret, in all editions of his Cours, saw algebra as the analysis of equations.
In 1854 all he did with Galois’s work was to summarise it in a few lines (on p. 4).
He asked the question: When is an equation solvable by radicals?, and replied with
references to Gallois (as Serret spelled the name).
This difﬁcult question has been completely answered, at least for irreducible equations of
prime degree, by Evariste Gallois, former student of the École Normale and one of the
deepest geometers that France has produced. In a memoir presented to the Academy of
Sciences in 1831 and published in 1846 thanks to the efforts of Liouville, Gallois in effect
proved this beautiful theorem: For an irreducible equation of prime degree to be solvable
by radicals it is necessary and sufﬁcient that, given any two of the roots, the others are
rationally deducible.
He went on to say that a polynomial equation of degree greater than 4 is not in
general solvable by radicals: “This important proposition, stated by Rufﬁni, was put
beyond doubt by the recent work of Abel.” In 1866 Serret merely added a few more
lines to note the work of Hermite, Kronecker, Betti and other (unnamed) authors
(and spelled ‘Galois’ correctly).
As Wussing went on to say (1984, 131), this
. . . indicates a certain precariousness in the evaluation of Galois’s contribution by members
of the French school in the early sixties. Galois’s work is regarded as being of greatest
signiﬁcance in the theory of solution of algebraic equations, but the fundamental role of the
group concept in that theory and elsewhere in mathematics is not yet realized.
Wussing pointed to Serret’s failure to bring out the concepts of group and normal
subgroup, and to describe the new method. The one theorem mentioned “is stated
in the framework and language of the traditional, Abel-inspired, solvability theory”.
That said, as Wussing remarked, Serret recognised the signiﬁcance of permutation
theory for Galois’s solvability theory, and did discuss Cauchy’s permutation theory.
Section IV, Substitutions
1. General properties of substitutions,
2. Properties of conjugate systems of substitutions,
3. The indices of conjugate systems,
4. Some special cases in the theory of substitutions,
5. Applications of the theory of substitutions.
4Wussing’s book remains an important inﬂuence on the history of abstract group theory and on the
tendency of mathematics in the ninetieth century towards increasing abstraction.

11.3
Serret
137
Section V, The algebraic resolution of equations
1. The equations of the third and fourth degrees. General considerations about the
algebraic resolution of equations,
2. The impossibility of the algebraic resolution of general equations of degree
greater than four,
3. Abelian equations,
4. On a class of equations of the ninth degree solvable algebraically.
The impossibility proof that Serret presented was not Galois’s but Abel’s. He
followed it with Wantzel’s shorter and simpler proof of the same result, which
he thought to present verbatim but from which he omitted some results about
permutations that he had proved earlier in the book, and which is clearer because
it is more explicit about the permutations of the roots that are involved. He then
proved that an equation is solvable by radicals if all of its roots are known rationally
when one of them, say x1, is known and the others are of the form
x1, x2 = θ(x1), x3 = θ(x2), . . . .
A few pages later Serret looked at the cyclotomic equation and summarised Gauss’s
results. He dealt in detail with the constructibility by straight-edge and circle of the
regular 17-gon.
Wussing then showed how Serret took over Cauchy’s “system of conjugate
substitutions”, amalgamated it with Galois’s closed set of substitutions, and came
to speak of “substitutions of a group of permutations”, although not of a “group of
substitutions”. This indicates, he suggests, how ambiguous Serret was about going
all the way with Galois, and how attracted he was to Cauchy’s ideas. Wussing (1984,
p. 134) observes that at one point (Serret 1866, 413–420)
Serret invokes a theorem of Galois, according to which it is possible to form a function
V of the roots of an equation with distinct roots which takes on different values under
all n! permutations of the roots, such that each of the roots can be represented as a rational
function of V . Serret’s proof is a direct repetition of Galois’s proof as published by Liouville
in 1846
which is an oddly traditional, almost Lagrangean, point to pick.5
Serret turned to Galois’s own contributions in the last chapter, “On the equations
that are solvable algebraically”, of Section V, when he worked through Galois’s
paper Sur les conditions de resolubilité des équations par radicaux (‘On the
conditions for the solvability of an equation by radicals’) (ﬁrst published 1846).
5Later, Serret was to be the main editor of the Oeuvres of Lagrange.

138
11
After Galois
Serret stuck closely to what Galois had done and how he had done it, noting that
(Cours, vol. 2, 607) “I have followed the order of the propositions adopted by Galois,
but, very frequently, I had to close the gaps in the proofs”, and that where, as in the
theorem about the existence of the function V just mentioned, Galois had employed
groups of permutations he (Serret) preferred to stick to substitutions. “After all”,
Serret wrote (Cours, vol. 2, 608–609), “it is just a simple change in the form of the
statements of the theorems, dictated by the fact that there is no reason to consider
permutations except from the point of view of substitutions by which one passes
from one to the other”.
Wussing, after quoting this passage, remarked:
Nothing need be added to these words. There is probably no better way to describe the
coexistence and the now (1866) completed amalgamation of the approaches of Cauchy and
Galois.
I would only add that Serret did prove (§§576, 577) that an irreducible polynomial
equation of prime degree is solvable by radicals if and only if its group is of the form
Galois indicated: the roots are permuted by a group of the form z →az + b, where
a and b are residues mod p and a is non-zero. He then deduced from this that such
an equation is solvable by radicals if and only if all of its roots are known rationally
when any two of them are given. We can think of this result as saying that the group
is solvable if and only if it has a representation of a certain kind—but Serret did not
use such language.
Serret then ended his book with a translation into French of a memoir by
Kronecker published in 1853 that we shall look at next.
11.4
Galois Theory in Germany: Kronecker and Dedekind
German accounts of Galois theory were to emphasize the idea of successive
adjunction of elements and the formation of (intermediate) ﬁelds, but before they
reached that level of sophistication they considered the idea of a group. Here we
look at two complementary accounts, by Kronecker and Dedekind, who were to
come to embody very different attitudes to the aims and nature of algebra.

The German mathematician Leopold Kronecker learned the new theory of
solvability of polynomial equations from Hermite and others during his stay in Paris
in 1853, when he was 30, and became interested in the study of solvable equations.
While there he wrote one of his earliest papers, in which he expressed himself with
remarkable force. He claimed the previous studies into solvable equations of prime
degree by Abel and Galois6
have essentially given as the result two criteria with which one can decide if a given equation
is solvable or not. In themselves these criteria shed not the least light on the nature of
solvable equations themselves. Indeed, strictly speaking one can not know at all if (aside
from what Abel considered in Crelle’s Journal vol. 4 and the simplest cases connected
with the binomial equations) there are any equations that satisfy the stated solvability
conditions. Still less can one construct such equations, and one is also not led through
other mathematical work to such equations. . . . And so the solvable equations themselves
have remained up to now in a certain darkness . . .

After Galois
Accordingly, Kronecker set himself the task of ﬁnding (1853, 4)
the most general algebraic function involving arbitrary quantities A, B, C, . . . that satisﬁes
an equation of given degree whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of these quantities.
In particular (1853, 8), to ﬁnd the most general form of an algebraic function
of A, B, C, etc. which, on varying the root signs that it contains, gives rise to
symmetric and cyclic rational functions of A, B, C, etc.
His conclusion (1853, 10–11) was that the roots of any Abelian equation of
any degree are rational expressions in the roots of unity—a celebrated result today
known as the Kronecker–Weber theorem, and ﬁrst proved by Weber in 1886.
He returned to the theme in a second paper with the same title (1856) and gave
an expression on p. 36 that characterised the roots of an irreducible polynomial
equation. This is explicit, if unwieldy, and it seems to have been regarded by many
subsequent writers as either the last word on the subject, or a dead end because, for
whatever reason, they do not make use of it. It is, of course, discussed by Netto in
his book (1882)—see Chap. 13—who followed it with a group-theoretic account in
Chap. 14. However, Kronecker gave no proofs of these results in his papers; he did
not even comment when Weber published a proof of the Kronecker–Weber theorem.
Edwards argues that Kronecker based his claim on papers that he had written but for
some reason never got round to publishing—such papers would now be irretrievably
lost. A proof of the formula was, however, given by Netto in his (1882), although
Edwards ﬁnds it incomplete.7
In fact, these early papers by Kronecker are indicative of his life-long interest
in the explicit and constructible in mathematics. He sought to construct all the
equations which are solvable by radicals, as for instance, the cyclotomic equations
αp−1
α−1 = 0, p a prime. Those equations in particular he called ‘Abelian’ in his (1856),
their characteristic feature being that all the roots are obtained from one of the roots
by successive repetition of a rational function—they are
x1, x2 = θ(x1), x3 = θ(x2), . . . .
It seems that this is the origin of the designation Abelian for a commutative group:
the group of a cyclotomic equation permutes the roots cyclically.
In one of his many later works on number theory (Kronecker 1870), Kronecker
gave an abstract deﬁnition of a ﬁnite commutative group, which he put in context as
follows8:
In articles 305 and 306 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Gauss based an arrangement of
the different classes of quadratic forms on the theory of composition, and Herr Schering has
recently dedicated a paper to the further development of the subject in a paper . . . . The very
simple principles on which Gauss’s method rests are applied not only in the places noted
but also frequently elsewhere—and indeed already in the elementary parts of number theory.
7Kronecker’s papers are discussed and corrected in Edwards (2009), where further historical
information can be found. The discussion in Wussing (1984, pp. 120–123) is also informative.
8The passage is quoted in Wussing (1984, p. 65) but this is a new translation.

Kronecker and Dedekind

This shows, and it is otherwise easy to be convinced, that these principles belong to a more
general and more abstract sphere of ideas. It is therefore proper to free their development
from all inessential restrictions, so that it is unnecessary to repeat the same argument when
applying it in different cases. This advantage is valid also for the development itself. Also,
when stated with all admissible generality, the presentation gains in simplicity and, since
only the truly essential features are thrown into relief, in transparency.
Kronecker then presented this deﬁnition:
Let θ′, θ′′, θ′′′, . . . be a ﬁnite number of elements such that from any two of them a third can
be derived by means of a deﬁnite procedure. Thus, if f denotes the result of this procedure
for two elements θ′ and θ′′, which may be identical with each other, then there exists a θ′′′
equal to f (θ′, θ′′). Furthermore we require that
f (θ′, θ′′) = f (θ′′, θ′)
f (θ′, f (θ′′, θ′′′)) = f (f (θ′, θ′′), θ′′′),
and if θ′′ is different from θ′′′ then f (θ′, θ′′) is different from f (θ′, θ′′′).
Once this is assumed, we can replace the operation denoted by f (θ′, θ′′) by multiplication
θ′ · θ′′, provided that instead of equality we employ equivalence. Thus using the usual
equivalence symbol “∼” we deﬁne the equivalence
θ′ · θ′′ ∼θ′′′
by means of the equation
f (θ′, θ′′) = θ′′′.
Wussing picked this up because the group elements are abstract and not
necessarily presented as permutations, but Kronecker was always concerned to use
the group-idea to advance other domains of mathematics, chieﬂy number theory,
and concentrated therefore on the study of the roots of equations, regarding them as
given by some construction.
Dedekind
Richard Dedekind was a friend of Riemann’s from his student days although, being
a pianist, he gravitated to the circles around Dirichlet, who was connected to the
Mendelssohns. He came to think of himself as the tortoise to Riemann’s hare, and
blessed with a long life became a great example of what can be done by constantly
thinking upon things. Even so, historians of mathematics were surprised when,
in 1976, Walther Purkert, a former student of Wussing’s, showed that Dedekind
had lectured on Galois theory at Göttingen in 1856–1858. It seems these may
be the ﬁrst lectures anywhere on the subject. As Purkert showed in his (1976)
Dedekind developed the idea of an abstract group in the context of Galois theory,
although he published nothing on it until 1894, in the famous 11th supplement to

142
11
After Galois
Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory (see the 4th edition).9 Dedekind’s manuscript,
as described by Purkert, goes far beyond the limited ideas about groups published
by his Werke, II, paper LXI. In it, Dedekind described the idea of permutations of a
ﬁnite set of objects is generalised to that of a ﬁnite abstract group. For permutations,
he showed
Theorem 11.1. If θθ′ = φ, θ′θ′′ = ψ, then φθ′′ = θψ, or more brieﬂy, (θθ′)θ′′ =
θ(θ′θ′′).
Theorem 11.2. From any two of the three equations φ = θ, φ′ = θ′, φφ′ = θθ′,
the third always follows.
The subsequent mathematical arguments, however,
are to be considered valid for any ﬁnite domain of elements, things, ideas, θ, θ′, θ′′, . . .
having a composition θθ′ of θ and θ′ deﬁned in any way, so that θθ′ is again a number
of the domain and the manner of the composition corresponds to that described in the two
fundamental theorems. (Purkert 1976, p. 4).
The ideas of subgroup (Divisor) and coset decomposition of a group G are deﬁned,
and a normal subgroup (eigentlicher Divisor) is deﬁned as one, K, satisfying
K = θ−1
1 Kθ1 = θ−1
2 Kθ2 = · · · = θ−1
h Kθh,
where the θs are coset representatives for K (cf. Galois: ‘propre’). Dedekind showed
that the cosets of a normal subgroup themselves formed a group, in which K played
the role of the identity element. It seems that he went on to apply his theory to
the study of polynomials, however, the manuscript is clearly incomplete, and a
‘ﬁeld-theoretic’ part is missing. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of the theory
of polynomial equations survives, and is analysed by Purkert.
9We shall look at a different aspect of this supplement in Chap. 19.

Chapter 12
Revision and First Assignment
It is time to revise the topics so far and discuss the ﬁrst assignment. Rather than
boil the previous eleven chapters down to a misleading ‘essence’, it is better to raise
some questions and let you answer them yourselves, to your own satisfaction.
The ﬁrst task is to start coming to grips with Gauss’s work on number theory. As
the extract from the book by Goldstein, Schappacher, and Schwermer explains very
clearly, the book redeﬁned—re-created, if you like—the subject of number theory
for the ninetieth century, which indicates how wide a framework must be to capture
fully what Gauss did.
The mathematics in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae provides evidence with
which to test claims about Gauss. Modular arithmetic is not difﬁcult, but Gauss’s
presentation was unusual in being systematic, and we can wonder why he provided
it. The subject is crucial to his account of both quadratic reciprocity and his theory
of quadratic form s; clearly he wanted an effective notation for it. As we noted,
Sophie Germain was to write to him in 1819 to thank him for introducing the idea
of equivalence to replace the previous use of equality; this small step made the
theory easier by removing an otherwise potentially confusing abuse of language.
Where does the question of reduction modulo a prime p ﬁrst enter the subject?
How often did Lagrange, or Gauss, need to ﬁnd a square root modulo p, as opposed
to knowing only whether a number was a square modulo p?
The theorem of quadratic reciprocity is special, as even the thorough build-up
through special cases demonstrates; see, for example, those questions about primes
p for which, say +2 or −2 is a square mod p. But why is it so special? Why did
Gauss call it the ‘golden theorem’?
Chapter 4 introduces the one truly difﬁcult part of Gauss’s Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae which is the theory of composition of quadratic form s (we saw
that even Kummer found this hard). Key words here are ‘ﬁxed relationship’ and
‘character’, and one jewel to appreciate is the table about forms of discriminant
−161. Before climbing any mountain, you need to be conﬁdent that the view from
the top is worth it (not to mention the health beneﬁts). In the present case, we should

Revision and First Assignment
ask: why was Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae so important? What was good
about it? What was difﬁcult about it? What impact did it have?
If you take a few minutes you will be able to show that the 16 equivalence
classes of positive forms of discriminant −161 are the only ones, and they have
the characters stated. You will not be able to show that in general only half the
possible characters arise, or prove theorems about composition. But this puts you in
the position of anyone reading the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, and indeed of Gauss
himself at one stage in the course of doing the work. It is impressive to have spotted
the pattern that the table illustrates, and even more so to have been able to prove it
exists in general.
Cyclotomy was the topic that ﬁrst drew people’s attention—I would suppose
from a mixture of interest and relative ease of access. Can you be more precise?
If you explore that question in detail, you might become a little unhappy with the
usual story about complex numbers in which Wessel and Argand play major roles.
The raw ingredient in the theory of cyclotomy, the clever idea that makes it work,
is the existence of primitive elements modulo a prime. Using this concept, Gauss
exhibited a whole class of polynomial equations and showed how to solve them by
solving a succession of much simpler equations. What is the big idea: that these
equations can be solved, or that they can be solved systematically?
Gauss frequently insisted that one of the merits of number theory was that simple
conjectures had deep proofs and that these proofs revealed hidden connections.
Chapter 6 offered some of the evidence: the connection between the theorem
of quadratic reciprocity and composition of forms; and the connection between
the theorem of quadratic reciprocity and cyclotomy (which is hard, and a bit
mysterious). The least that Gauss’s proofs establish is that the connection is
genuine—can you say anything more?
There is surely no dispute at this stage that what Gauss did was very difﬁcult. I
might be prepared to argue that it was unusually difﬁcult, and that the difﬁculties
were of a particularly conceptual kind—indeed, that that is one of the ways the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae had the impact it eventually did. Be that as it may,
Dirichlet’s lectures were the vehicle by which people learned Gaussian number
theory. How do they compare with Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae? In his
(1851) Dirichlet published his simpliﬁed theory of composition of forms. What was
simpler about it? Is it a step forwards, sideways, or backwards?
Finally, on the basis of what you know, how does Gauss’s theory of forms surpass
Legendre’s?
Chapter 8 introduces the other principal topic in this book: the solution of
polynomial equations by radicals, and its transformation into Galois theory. Implicit
in this presentation is the idea that Galois’s work may best be seen as redeﬁning and
recreating the ﬁeld of the theory of equations very much as Gauss rewrote number
theory.
The solution of cubic and quartic equations by radicals was a considerable
breakthrough that was not followed by progress with the quintic, which is why
Lagrange investigated both why equations of lower degree were solvable by radicals

12
Revision and First Assignment
145
and why progress halted with the failure to solve equations of degree 5. What is a
Lagrangian resolvent? Why are they useful?
Chapter 9 is more historical: it sets the scene with what was known before Galois
and what was known immediately after, so that we can understand the importance
of what Galois did. Rufﬁni almost succeeded, and Abel succeeded completely, in
showing that the general quintic equation is not solvable by radicals. A little later
Pierre Wantzel showed that two of the so-called three classical problems are not
solvable by straight edge and circle. There are many reasons why one mathematician
does what another did not, but one concern stands out here, which is tied to the idea
of symmetry. What did Rufﬁni and Abel bring to the problem of the quintic that
Lagrange did not, and how did it help?
Chapter 10 is (with Chap. 6) the only really hard lecture in the book. Galois’s
ﬁrst Mémoire was not understood by his contemporaries, and arguably not for a
generation. Our task as historians is to understand how that happened, not to make
his badly written, conceptually profound Mémoire easy to understand. But it is
possible to see tantalising glimmers in it. For example, can you see a connection
to what went on before in the solution of the quartic equation? Can you line up what
Ferrari did in solving the quartic with Lagrange’s comments and with the remarks
about the solution that Galois made?
It is unlikely that anyone promptly understood all that Galois had to say about
quintic equations—but what did he say about which ones are solvable by radicals?
What did he mean by the terms ‘successive adjunction’ and ‘rationally known’?
I do wish to insist on the sheer incomprehensibility of Galois’s ideas, at least in
their day. The wrong way to tackle this painful difﬁculty in a course on the history of
mathematics would be to sort out the mathematics. That will happen, in the proper
historical order. Our task here is to analyse the actual historical situation.
We can begin with the texts. We are not dealing with fully written out, published
papers, but with two memoirs that disappeared for a time, a letter written hastily to a
non-mathematician, a few short, published papers, and manuscripts. (Indeed, in this
book, we are dealing with only one memoir, one published paper, and the letter.) As
we shall see later, nothing was to be published until 1846, 14 years after Galois’s
death. These memoirs, branded unclear by the inﬂuential Poisson, were truly hard
to understand, perhaps because he had not acquired the skill of explaining highly
original ideas to a bemused, if expert, audience.
Galois himself was uncompromising on the subject. In the preface to the
Mémoires he wrote1:
Since the beginning of this century algorithmics had attained such a degree of complication
that any progress had become impossible by these means, without the elegance with which
modem geometers have believed they should imprint their research, and by means of
which the mind promptly and with a single glance grasps a large number of operations.
[. . . ] I believe that the simpliﬁcations produced by elegance of calculations (intellectual
simpliﬁcations, of course; there are no material ones) have their limits; I believe that the
time will come when the algebraic transformations foreseen by the speculations of analysts
1Adapted from Neumann (2011, pp. 251–253).

will ﬁnd neither the time nor the place for their realisation; at which point one will have to
be content with having foreseen them.
Jump with both feet on calculations, put operations into groups, class them according to
their difﬁculty and not according to their form; that is, according to me, the mission of
future geometers, that is the path that I have entered in this work.
The romance of Galois’s life (which is how it is often, if naively, seen) cannot
obscure the fact that he did not prepare his desk drawer for posterity. It is easier to
imagine, in fact, that all could have been lost.
Next, the problem. It is worth thinking about how you would prove that some-
thing cannot be done. It is necessary to ﬁnd some way of looking at all attempts,
those known and those yet to be tried, and showing that there is some intrinsic
element of the task that they must all fail. It is not just that the mathematician must
contemplate a radically different task from that of applying a new solution method,
it is also that new tools must be devised that characterise the allowable methods
and exhibit their intrinsic weakness. It is a curious fact that others were ﬁnding
impossibility results in mathematics: Wantzel in algebra, Bolyai and Lobachevskii
with their discovery of non-Euclidean geometry (which was rejected for even longer,
until the 1850s and 1860s). Had it been found possible to solve the quintic by
radicals—had Galois shown it by his new methods—his work would surely still
have been difﬁcult to follow, but to use new methods to show a new kind of result
was an even greater challenge to his eventual readers.
Chapter 11 traces the gradual recognition of the importance of Galois’s work in
France and Germany. Do you think any of these people fully grasped it? What does
that say about how mathematics evolves?
Mathematics most likely looks difﬁcult most of the time, although I hope it
also looks interesting and rewarding. One speciﬁc problem facing a historian of
mathematics is that the subject is disproportionately full of just those few people
whom we like to think did not ﬁnd mathematics difﬁcult, and this encourages a
lazy habit of supposing that it was indeed easy for them. We look at their output,
at their youth, and often the absence of any formal training, and ﬁnd ourselves day-
dreaming that they could have tossed their papers off in a few afternoons and that
the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, a book of some 400 pages, only took 4 years to
write because it was long and written in Latin, which takes extra time.
This is silly. It is true, to borrow a phrase once used of Alan Turing, that Gauss,
Abel, and Galois each reached a place where things that looked difﬁcult to other
people looked easy to them, but one cannot suppose that getting there was easy.
Indeed, I would suggest that one of the reasons for the growing prestige of number
theory in Germany was the recognition that it was hard, and people who succeeded
at it had joined an elite group of people who could do difﬁcult things, with all the
effort and psychological pressure that that involves.
At all events, we have good evidence that Gauss found this work difﬁcult—he
tells us so, when he speaks of many fruitless attempts to ﬁnd proofs—and some
evidence that Abel did—witness his two attempts to explain his account of the
quintic. And we have an abundance of evidence that people who came to read their
work found it difﬁcult. Dirichlet is an excellent example, Kummer another, and then

12

147
there is the sheer failure of anyone to master Galois’s work for two decades after
1846.
With these considerations in mind, here is what became my standard ﬁrst
question on the course, in each of its two variants. The question was to be answered
in a page, so as to force students to decide what was really important.
Question 1a Imagine you are young British professor ﬁnishing a year or two
studying mathematics abroad. You are writing a letter advising a very good student
who will take your place out here. Describe what has been taken to be important
and why in the work of either Gauss (c. 1810) or Galois (c. 1846).
Question 1b Imagine you are British student writing to your former professor
about the year you have just spent studying mathematics abroad, either in Brunswick
and Göttingen under Gauss around 1810 or in Paris around 1846. What would you
tell him about contemporary developments in mathematics? Your answer should
describe what has been taken to be important and why in the work of either Gauss
or Galois.
I set the date for Gauss at 1810 to allow for the French appreciation of the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae to be clear. I set the Galois date at 1846 so that the
student (or the professor) could have sat in on Liouville’s discussions and might
have read his version of Galois’s memoirs.
In either version, the question helped put over the point that the course was a
history course, in which the views of various mathematicians are at stake, and that
these people could no more see their future than we can see ours. It is therefore a
mistake to write a history of the period, with all the later insights that have accrued,
rather than a viewpoint ‘from’ the period, and a low mark for such an essay therefore
helped students to see the difference, and so to appreciate the historian’s task a little
more clearly.

Jordan’s Traité
13.1
Introduction
The book that established group theory as a subject in its own right in mathematics
was the French mathematician Jordan’s Traité des Substitutions et des Équations
Algébriques of 1870. Here we look at what that book contains, and how it deﬁned
the subject later known as group theory.
Fig. 13.1 Camille Jordan
(1838–1922)
Although there was a great deal more to Jordan’s Traité than a discussion of
Galois theory, it will help to stay close to the study of quartic and quintic equations.
Jordan’s idea was to associate to every polynomial equation a group, which he called
the group of the equation, and to show that questions about solving a polynomial
equation of any degree could be rephrased as questions about its group and tackled
there. Jordan not only gave a novel backbone and a structure to Galois’s obscure
remarks, which enabled them to be understood much more profoundly than before,
he endeavoured to move the subject away from the theory of equations and towards a

more abstract theory of (substitution) groups. In this he was helped by the existence
of a difﬁculty in the theory that is seldom addressed explicitly: it is not easy to ﬁnd
the ‘Galois group’ of a given equation. ‘Galois theory’, whatever that is taken to
mean, may be interesting, but it is unlikely to help anyone whose daily business is
with solving polynomial equations. We must leave equation solving behind when
we follow Jordan, and learn to ask other questions about equations.
13.2
Early Group Theory: Introduction
As part of his creation of Galois theory Jordan employed the concepts of transitive
group actions and composition series. This section revises enough group theory to
understand what Jordan presented in his Traité in 1870. We need two ideas that we
have not so far met: the knowledge of which subgroups of S4 or S5 act transitively,
and of the composition series of a group. For more detail on this, see Appendix G.
Transitive Subgroups
Jordan said a group was transitive (p. 29) if “when applying all its substitutions
successively one can move one of its letters to the place of an arbitrary other one;
more generally, it will be n-fold transitive the substitutions permit one to move n
given letters a, b, c, . . . to the places formerly occupied by n other arbitrary letters
a′, b′, c′, . . .”. In our words, a group G acting on a set S does so transitively if for
any two elements a, a′ ∈S there is a g ∈G such that ga = a′, and it acts n-
fold transitively if for any two n-tuples of elements of S, say a1, a2, . . . , an and
a′
1, a′
2, . . . , a′
n there is a g ∈G such that ga1 = a′
1, ga2 = a′
2, . . . , gan = a′
n.
Jordan saw that the group of a polynomial equation acts transitively on the
roots if and only if the equation is irreducible. Accordingly, he regarded solving
a polynomial equation as a process of the successive adjunction of numbers, the
idea being that worthwhile adjunctions reduce the size of the group and that every
time a group is reduced to one that acts intransitively on the roots the polynomial
equation factorises. Eventually the group is reduced to the identity, the equation is
completely factorised, and all the roots are therefore known.
This programme requires that the transitive subgroups of S4 and S5 are known.
Jordan knew that if a group acts transitively on a set of n elements then it has an orbit
of order n and therefore n divides the order of the group. In the case of subgroups of
S5 this tells us that a transitive subgroup contains a 5-cycle. But in the case of S4 it
tells us that the transitive subgroups have order a multiple of 4, but this allows for the

13.2
Early Group Theory: Introduction
151
possibility that we might be looking at the Klein group, which does act transitively.1
We deduce that
•
The transitive subgroups of S4 are: S4, A4, S(square), and K the Klein group.
•
The transitive subgroups of S5 are: S5, A5, G(20), S(pentagon), and C5, the
cyclic group of order 5.
Composition Series
Jordan then turned to ‘normal’ subgroups and composition factors. He was inter-
ested in a subgroup H of a group G that commuted with all the elements of G—a
relationship he called ‘permutable’, meaning gH = Hg, ∀g ∈G. This in turn
means that for every h ∈H and every g ∈G there is an h′ ∈H such that gh = h′g.
He said G was composite if it had a subgroup of this kind (other than itself and the
identity), otherwise he said it was simple, and he observed that every group admits a
chain of subgroups each one ‘permuting’, if I may invent that word, with the group
before. He did not introduce a special word for a subgroup that ‘permutes’ with a
larger group; the word ‘normal’ is used today and it would be acceptable to use
it here in quotes. In a chain of ‘normal’ subgroups, each one ‘normal’ in the one
before, say
G = G0 > G1 > · · · > Gj > Gj+1 > · · · > Gn = {e},
Jordan called the orders of the quotients
|Gj |
|Gj+1| the composition factors, and (Book
II, Chapter 1, Section IV) he proved the theorem that the composition factors are
unique up to order provided the chain cannot be reﬁned (such a chain is called
maximal). Notice that for Jordan the numbers in the composition series for a group
are obtained by dividing one number by another; they are not the size of the
corresponding quotient group,
Gj
Gj+1 . Jordan was to equivocate about quotient groups
for a further few years, until 1873.
The composition series of S4 is obtained from the maximal chain
S4 ▷A4 ▷K ▷Z2 ▷{e},
where K is the Klein group, and is therefore 2, 3, 2, 2.
The composition series of S5 is obtained from the maximal chain
S5 ▷A5 ▷{e},
because the group A5 is simple, and is therefore 2, 60.
1This group only acquired its name after Klein’s work in the late 1870s, but it was known earlier.

Jordan’s Traité
13.3
Jordan’s Traité
The publication of Galois’s work in Liouville’s Journal was a challenge to all
mathematicians to understand it, extend it, and apply it. Ultimately, it stimulated
the emerging generation of mathematicians, as Wussing (1984) has described. He
noted an initial period in which Betti, Kronecker, Cayley, Serret, and some others
ﬁlled in holes in Galois’s presentation of the idea of a group. These modest yet
difﬁcult pieces of work established the connection between group theory and the
solvability of equations by radicals, and then explored the solution of equations by
other means than radicals (generalising the way the trigonometric formulae can be
used to solve some cubic equations). The implicit idea of a group was expressed in
terms of permutation of a ﬁnite set of objects, amalgamating Cauchy’s presentation
of the theory of permutation groups in 1844–1846 and Galois’s terminology. The
elements are often called substitutions or operations, they come with a set of objects
which they permute, there is no sense of a group as something other than a certain
type of collections of ‘substitutions’.
The crucial presentations of the idea of permutation groups were made by Jordan
in his Commentaire sur Galois (1869) and his Traité des Substitutions et des
Équations Algébriques (1870).2 Jordan’s systematic theory of permutation groups
was much more abstract; he spoke of abstract properties such as commutativity, con-
jugacy, centralizers, transitivity, ‘normal’ subgroups (and, one might say obliquely,
of quotient groups), group homomorphisms and isomorphisms. So much so that
one can argue (contra Wussing) that Jordan came close to possessing the idea of
an abstract group. Jordan said (Traité, p. 22, quoted in Wussing, p. 104) “One will
say that a system of substitutions forms a group (or a faisceau) if the product of
two arbitrary substitutions of the system belong to the system itself”. He spoke
(Traité, p. 56, Wussing, p. 105) of isomorphisms (which he called an isomorphisme
holoédrique) between groups as one-to-one correspondences between substitutions
which respect products. It could be that the use of words like ‘substitution’ and the
permutation notation were well-adapted to their purpose, but should not to be taken
too literally.
A further indication of the high level of abstraction at which Jordan worked is his
use of technical concepts of increasing power—he was one of the ﬁrst to use Sylow
theory in the treatment of ﬁnite groups. Another is the wide range of situations in
the Traité in which groups could be found permuting geometrical objects: the 27
lines on a cubic surface, the 28 bitangents to a quartic, the symmetry groups of the
conﬁguration of the nine inﬂection points on a cubic and of Kummer’s quartic with
sixteen nodal points. Powerful abstract theory and a skilled recognition of groups
‘in nature’ suggests that Jordan had an implicit understanding of the group idea
that he presented in the language of permutation groups only for the convenience
2I pass over Jordan’s ﬁrst account of Galois’s work, his (1865), described by Wussing (1984, p.
136) as being “essentially of the gap-ﬁlling variety, while the second (Jordan 1869) is unmistakably
concerned with making precise the group-theoretic component of Galois theory”.

of his audience. This is not to deny the role of permutation theoretic ideas in
Jordan’s work, indicated by the emphasis on transitivity and degree (= the number of
elements in the set being permuted), but rather to indicate that ideas of composition
and action (as for example change of basis in linear problems) were prominent, and
could be seized upon by other mathematicians.
A little more detail is instructive, but Jordan’s Traité is a work of some 660
pages, and it can only be summarised selectively here.3 It is in four books. The short
Livre I picks up on the topic of Galois (1830) and is about congruences modulo a
prime or prime power (what we today would call ﬁnite ﬁelds). The material on
modular arithmetic is needed because the Traité is entirely about ﬁnite groups (often
described as matrix groups with entries modulo a prime number).
Livre II is about substitutions (Galois’s word for what later became permuta-
tions). It ranges widely, bringing in work by Lagrange, Cauchy, Mathieu, Kirkman,
Bertrand, and Serret. Its themes are transitivity, simple and multiple, primitivity (the
topic of Galois’s second memoir) and composition factors. It also gives a (ﬂawed)
proof that the alternating group An is simple when n ̸= 4. Here Jordan presented
the opening propositions in the theory of groups: Lagrange’s theorem and Cauchy’s
theorem. Lagrange’s theorem is stated in the form it retains to this day: the order of
a subgroup divides the order of the group, and the proof is the coset decomposition
argument. Cauchy’s theorem (§40) is the partial converse: if a prime p divides the
order of a group then there is an element of order p in the group. This result is
deeper: I omit the proof.
Then comes an account of transitivity, and the ‘orbit-stabiliser’ theorem: Jordan
proved (§44) that given a set of objects permuted by a group G, if these elements
can be sent to m different systems of places, and n is the order of the subgroup
that leaves these elements ﬁxed, then the order of the group is mn. Jordan was very
interested in how transitive a group could be, and in §47 recorded the ‘remarkable’
example of the Mathieu group on 12 letters that is 5-fold transitive.
Then we get some 160 pages on what we might call ﬁnite linear groups,
groups whose elements are matrices with entries in a ﬁnite ﬁeld. They come in
various types, and the names have not always retained the meaning Jordan gave
them: primary, orthogonal, abelian, hypoabelian. A typical theme is the ‘normal’
subgroups and composition factors of the different groups. He was also interested
in the concept of primitivity, which he deﬁned negatively: a group is non-primitive
(better, imprimitive) if the elements can be divided into blocks containing the same
number of elements and the group maps blocks to blocks.
Livre III, ‘The irrationals’, is about the behaviour of a given irreducible equation
under successive adjunction of irrationals (roots of other polynomial equations). It
deals with the solution of the quartic by radicals and the insolubility of the general
quintic. Then we get a treatment of equations with particular kinds of group: abelian
groups and what Jordan called ‘Galois’s equation’ xp = A. Then we get the
geometrical examples mentioned above in which discoveries by Hesse, Clebsch,

Jordan’s Traité
Kummer, and Cayley (the 27 lines on a cubic surface) are shown to have interesting
group-theoretic interpretations. Then comes material from elliptic function theory:
the modular equation and the discovery in 1858 of the solution of the quintic
equation according to Hermite and Kronecker. Jordan reworked their contributions
in his own way and then extended their work to show that all polynomial equations
can be solved by a similar use of hyper-elliptic functions.
The book ends with Livre IV, of almost 300 pages, entitled ‘Solution by radicals’.
Jordan quickly rehearsed the argument that an equation is solvable by radicals if and
only if the composition factors of its group are all prime, and called such a group
solvable. This led him to proclaim three problems, of which for brevity I give the
ﬁrst only: construct explicitly for every degree the general [i.e. maximal] solvable
transitive groups. The theorems concern maximal solvable groups of transitive
groups, as Dieudonné (1962) explained.
Jordan used his theory of composition factors to suggest that a massive process
of induction might sufﬁce to ﬁnd all the permutation groups. After all, the maximal
normal subgroup of a given group is smaller than the given group, and its index
is determined by the given group. So it might be possible to construct the given
group from its composition series if all groups of order less than the given group
are known. In the event this ambitious programme failed—groups are vastly more
varied than can be handled this way—but it has the germ of a process that was later
made more precise by Hölder and became the search for all simple groups.
13.4
Jordan’s Galois Theory
We now look at Book III Chapter 1 of the Traité in more detail. For a partial
translation, see Appendix D.
In Chapter 1 Jordan followed Galois closely, but with the new resources of an
explicit theory of groups. He began by considering the group of substitutions of the
roots of a polynomial equation with distinct roots, whose coefﬁcients are rational
functions of the rational numbers and some auxiliary quantities. This is called
the group of the equation, and it can alter with further adjunctions of auxiliary
quantities. Jordan showed that any function of the roots that is not altered in
numerical value by any substitution in the group is rationally expressible in terms
of the coefﬁcients, and conversely.
He showed that irreducible equations have transitive groups and that the converse
also holds. In particular, if an equation of degree n is such that all its roots are a
rational function of any one of them then the group is of order n.
Then he investigated what happens to the group G of an equation if a rational
function ϕ of the roots is adjoined, and showed that the group reduces to the
subgroup H of substitutions that do not alter the numerical value of ϕ. An analogous
result holds if several quantities are adjoined simultaneously. Conversely, if rational
functions ϕ1 and ϕ2 are invariant under the same group then each is a rational
function of the other. Jordan also showed that if ϕ1 takes the n values ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕn

13.4
Jordan’s Galois Theory
155
under the substitutions of G then
n = |G|
|H|.
If one recalls that Jordan did not possess the concept of a quotient group when
writing the Traité then this result can be given an added degree of signiﬁcance,
because his proof essentially identiﬁes the group of the equation
(Y −ϕ1)(Y −ϕ2) . . . (Y −ϕn) = 0
(13.1)
as the quotient group G/H. His proof also shows that this equation is irreducible.
From this point on it is helpful to think of Jordan’s Galois theory as being
concerned with the given equation and a succession of auxiliary equations.
Next Jordan showed that if the result of adjoining ϕ1 is to reduce the group G to
the group H1 and the result of adjoining ϕ2 is to reduce the group G to the group
H2 and if the substitution b transforms ϕ1 into ϕ2 then the groups H1 and H2 are
conjugate and indeed H2 = bH1b−1.
When the process of adjunction is complete and the roots are known, every
rational combination of them is also known, so one wants to have not only ϕ1 say
but also ϕ2, . . . , ϕn. It can happen that adjoining ϕ1 necessarily adjoins the others,
but it need not, and if one adjoins all the ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕn at once the group of the
equation reduces to K, the largest ‘normal’ subgroup of the groups H1, H2, . . .. In
this case the order of the group (13.1) is ν and the order of the group K is |G|/ν.
The solution of a polynomial equation was described by Jordan in terms of a
sequence of adjunctions. An adjunction may or may not change the group of the
equation, and even if it does reduce the order of the group it may not result in a
factorisation of the equation—that will happen if and only if the reduced group does
not act transitively on the roots.
Then we come to Jordan’s Theorem XIII, which says: Let F(x) = 0 and F ′(x) =
0 be two equations whose groups, G and G′ respectively have N and N′ elements
[substitutions]. If the resolution of the second equation reduces the group of the ﬁrst
to a group H having at most N/ν elements then the resolution of the ﬁrst equation
reduces the group of the second to a group H ′ having at most N′/ν. Moreover, the
two equations are composed with the same auxiliary equation f (u) = 0 of degree
ν and whose group has ν elements.
His Theorem XV says: No irreducible equation of prime degree p can be solved
by means of auxiliary equations of lower degree. His proof runs as follows: Because
the equation is irreducible, its group is transitive and therefore of order divisible by
p. By Theorem XIII it remains divisible by p provided one does not use an auxiliary
equation of order divisible by p. But the order of the group of an auxiliary equation
of degree q < p is a divisor of q! and so prime to p. Therefore the order of the group
of the given equation remains divisible by p provided one only employs similar
equations.

156
13
Jordan’s Traité
Finally, Jordan’s Theorem XVI says: The general equation of degree n cannot
be solved by means of equations of lower degrees unless n = 4. The proof goes
like this. The group of the equation has order n!—that’s the meaning of ‘general’—
and it can be reduced to the alternating group of order n!
2 by resolving an equation
of degree 2. But this new group is simple (§85). Therefore the equation cannot be
solved by means of an auxiliary equation unless the order of its group is at least
equal to n!
2 , but if q is the degree of this auxiliary equation, its order divides q!.
Therefore q cannot be less than n.
This concludes Jordan’s account of the solution of a polynomial equation by
auxiliary irrationals, which by deﬁnition are the roots of other polynomial equations.
His result is a generalisation of Galois’s on the solution of equations by radicals. It
remained for Jordan to complete his account of the solution by radicals, which is the
case where the auxiliary equations are of a special kind, xp −a = 0, corresponding
to the adjunction of a pth root of a known quantity.
He did this in Chap. 2, where he dealt with abelian equations and especially those
of prime degree, before turning to Galois equations, their groups, and the equation
xp = A. Kronecker had earlier introduced the term ‘abelian equation’ to refer to
those equations whose corresponding group is cyclic; Jordan proposed extending
the term to equations whose groups are commutative, and the term now adheres to
the groups.
At stake is an irreducible equation F(x) = 0 of degree p a prime, with the further
property that all its roots can be expressed rationally in terms of any two of them,
say x0 and x1. (Such an equation is xp = A, as we can see, the roots being some
quantity α multiplied by the powers of a primitive pth root of unity.) The task is to
ﬁnd the group of this equation.
Jordan noted that the order of the group cannot exceed p(p −1), which is
the number of choices one has for the images of x0 and x1 under permutations
permuting the roots.
On the other hand it is transitive and therefore its order is divisible by p, and
therefore it has an element of order p, which he wrote in the form φ(z) = z + 1—
tacitly working mod p. Jordan then showed that the elements of order p are precisely
the powers of this one (else the group would be too big). But conjugates of an
element of order p are also of order p, so the group consists precisely of elements
of the form z →az + b.
Jordan next showed that the given equation can be solved by successively
adjoining the roots of two abelian equations, one of degree p the other of degree
p −1. This follows from the observation that one ﬁrst adjoins a rational function of
the roots that is invariant under φ.
The equation xp = A is of the kind under study, and its group must have order
p(p −1), because the quotient x1/x0 of two roots x1 and x0 satisﬁes the irreducible
equation
xp −1
x −1 = 0
of degree p −1.

The Cubic and Quartic Equations
It is helpful to look again at the account of the solution of low degree equations in
the spirit of successive adjunctions. It can also be productive to treat what follows
as a series of exercises and derive for yourself the various results.

Then

So if Δ and α are known then so are β and γ .
In terms of Galois groups, consider
Q →Q(Δ) →Q(Δ, α) →Q(Δ, α, β, γ ).
The permutations of the roots that ﬁx every ‘number’ in Q(Δ) are precisely the
even permutations (they form the group A3). We have just seen that the collections
of ‘known numbers’ Q(Δ, α) and Q(Δ, α, β, γ ) are the same. In the context of
groups we see that this way: if Q(Δ, α) was a proper subset of Q(Δ, α, β, γ ) then
the permutation (β, γ ) would be available to form a non-trivial subgroup of order 2
of the group of permutations Q(Δ, α, β, γ ) that ﬁx Q(Δ, α)—but this would imply
(by Lagrange’s theorem)—that 2 divides 3, which is absurd.

What a Difference a Discriminant Makes
Consider the equation x3 −2 = 0 with roots ρ, where ρ3 = 2, ρω and ρω2, where
ω2 + ω + 1 = 0, so ω is a complex cube root of unity. The discriminant of this
equation is Δ = −6(1 + 2ω), and we note that
Δ.(−Δ) = −36(1 + 2ω)2 = −36(4 + 4ω + 4ω2 −3) = 108.
The equation Δ = −6(1 + 2ω) tells us that Q(Δ) = Q(ω). Let me write Q∗here
and elsewhere to mean Q with suitable cube roots adjoined—in this case a cube root
of unity. So Q∗= Q(Δ).
Now, if we adjoin ρ to Q we do not adjoin either ρω or ρω2 because ρ is real
and the others are not. (Nor indeed does adjoining just ρω adjoin either ρ or ρω2.)
So adjoining one root gives us three conjugate extensions of Q. For example, Q(ρ)
and Q(ρω) are conjugate by any permutation of the roots that exchanges ρ and ρω.
There are three corresponding Galois groups:
1. The permutations of the roots that also ﬁx ρ;
2. The permutations of the roots that also ﬁx ρω;
3. The permutations of the roots that also ﬁx ρω2.
They are conjugate, but not normal, there is no equation with rational coefﬁcients
that has only, say ρ, as a root and accordingly no corresponding Galois group. If
we adjoin all three roots at once the group of permutations of the roots that ﬁxes
all the ‘known numbers’ (i.e. the rationals with the roots adjoined) is, trivially, the
identity group, but it is indeed the largest ‘normal’ subgroup of each of the above
three groups, as Jordan’s theory requires.
Things are very different if we ﬁrst adjoint Δ to Q to get Q∗, and then adjoin,
say ρ. Now the other roots come in automatically, being rational combinations of ρ
and Δ, i.e. of ρ and ω. We have
Q(Δ) →Q(Δ, ρ) = Q(Δ, ρω) = Q(Δ, ρω2) = Q(ρ, ρω, ρω2).
The groups of permutations of the roots that ﬁx Δ and also ﬁx ρ or ρω or ρω2 are
the same (not merely conjugate); they are all adjoined at once by an equation whose
group is A3, and we can now see that the equation for Δ appears as the equation for
the quotient group S3/A3.
The Quartic Equation
Let us take x4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0 with distinct roots α1, α2, α3, α4. The
discriminant is again denoted Δ, and two cases arise according as we adjoin Δ to Q
or not. (Of course, it can happen that Δ is rational anyway.) In either case, deﬁne
τ2 = α1α2 + α3α4, τ3 = α1α3 + α2α4, τ4 = α1α4 + α2α3.

13.5
The Cubic and Quartic Equations
159
The expressions
τ2 + τ3 + τ4, τ2τ3 + τ3τ4 + τ4τ2, τ2τ3τ4
are symmetric (unaltered by any permutation of the roots). Indeed, with a little work
we ﬁnd that
τ2 + τ3 + τ4 = c, τ2τ3 + τ3τ4 + τ4τ2 = bd −4e, τ2τ3τ4 = b2e + d2 −4ce,
so we could, if we wished, write down the cubic equation of which they are the roots
and whose coefﬁcients are ﬁxed by all permutations of the roots and are therefore
rational in b, c, d, e.
If we do adjoin Δ to Q, and work over Q(Δ), then the group of permutations of
the roots that also ﬁx Δ is at most A4, the even permutations on the four roots. The
even permutations of the roots that ﬁx τ2, τ3, and τ4 form the group
K = {1, (α1, α2)(α3, α4), (α1, α3)(α2, α4), (α1, α4)(α2, α3)}.
This group is a normal subgroup of A4, with quotient A3. Can we adjoin say τ2 to
Q(Δ) without adjoining the others? To answer this question, we look at the stabiliser
of τ2 in A4, which we denote St2. We ﬁnd that St2 = K. This means that the
groups St2, St3, St4 are all equal, and normal, of course, in A4, and that any even
permutation of the roots that also ﬁxes τ2 ﬁxes the others, so indeed τ3 and τ4 are
rationally known when τ2 and Δ are.
Let me now stress that if the Galois group of an equation is A3 then the effect of
adjoining any rational expression in the roots either changes nothing or brings in all
the roots of the equation.
Matters are different if we have not adjoined Δ to Q. Now the group of
permutations of the roots is S4 and K is not a normal subgroup of S4. We ﬁnd
that in S4
St2 = K ∪K(α1, α2),
with similar expressions for St3 and St4. These three groups are conjugate, for
example
(23)St2(23) = St3.
Comfortingly, the conjugating elements are odd, and cannot be in A4.
This means that adjoining say τ2 to Q does not adjoin τ3; τ3 is not a rational
function of τ2. If we adjoin τ2, τ3, and τ4 simultaneously, we ﬁnd that the group of
permutations of the roots that ﬁx the τs is indeed K, the largest normal subgroup of
S4 contained in St2, St3, and St4, i.e. in St2 ∩St3 ∩St4. This is what Jordan proved.

160
13
Jordan’s Traité
Consider now the system of adjunctions:
Q →Q(Δ) →Q(Δ, τ2) →Q(Δ, τ2, κ) →Q(α1, α2, α3, α4),
where κ = α1α2. The new quantity κ and λ = α3α4 are the roots of the equation
y2 −τ2y + e = 0.
Finally, α1 and α2 are the roots of the equation
y2 −μy + κ = 0,
where μ = α1 + α2 stands for a rational expression in Δ, τ2, τ3, τ4 and κ that is
found as follows. We have the equations
d = −λ(α1 + α2) −κ(α3 + α4),
b = −(α1 + α2) −(α3 + α4),
and solving them for μ = α1 + α2 yields
μ = κb −λ
λ −κ .
To summarise: we start with a Galois group isomorphic to S4 and by adjoining
Δ reduce the group to A4. We adjoin say τ2—recall that τ3 and τ4 come
automatically—and the Galois group becomes K. Up to this point the quartic
equation does not factorise, because the group K acts transitively on the roots. But if
we adjoin κ the Galois group reduces to Z2 which is not transitive and the equation
factorises into a product of two quadratics. Finally, we solve the quadratics, the
Galois group reduces to the identity and the original quartic is solved.
It is instructive to see where the auxiliary irrationals Δ, τ2, τ3, τ4 and κ come
from. Δ is the root of a quadratic, its Galois group is isomorphic to Z2 that allows
us to switch Δ and −Δ while not altering the rationals (assuming, here, that Δ is
not itself rational). Now we adjoin the τs—adjoin any one and we get the others—
and they are the roots of a cubic with coefﬁcients in Q(Δ) and as it happens
the coefﬁcients are in Q, as we saw. This cubic has group A3 precisely because
adjoining one τ adjoins the other, and indeed A3 is isomorphic to the quotient group
A4/K. The same story holds for adjoining κ and then again for the adjunction of α.

13.5
The Cubic and Quartic Equations
161
Solvability by Radicals
It remains to connect this story to solvability by radicals. Solvability by radicals
requires that each adjunction is a pure radical, something of the form
n√σ, where σ
is a quantity in the collection of ‘numbers’ we are trying to enlarge. It is enough to
assume n is prime, say p. Adjoining a pure pth root shows up in the Galois group,
as follows (where for simplicity I shall assume σ is in Q).
Let the roots of xp −σ = 0 be ρ where ρp = σ and ρ is real, and ρωk,
k = 1, 2, . . .p−1, where ω is a primitive complex kth root of unity, or, more simply,
the roots are of the form ρωk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .p −1. Any allowable permutation of
these must be given in the form k →ak + b where a and b are taken mod p
and a is not zero (as Galois proved), because the new expressions are of the form
ρjωk = ρj−kωk, where j is nonzero mod p and k is any number mod p, and once
we know the images of ρ and ρω under a permutation of the roots we know the
image of ρjωk. It helps to notice that there are p(p −1) expressions of the form
ρjωk.
So for an equation to be solvable by radicals the successive adjunctions must
correspond to quotient groups, as above, that are subgroups of the above group of
order p(p −1) for some prime p. In this way we can get to a group of order 20, but
not beyond, so only equations with Galois groups that are this group or one of its
subgroups are solvable by radicals.
One ﬁnal question: can you now tackle the ﬁrst cases of the inverse problem, and
ﬁnd for every subgroup of S4 a polynomial with that Galois group?

Introduction
In this chapter and the next we look at how Galois theory became established.
This will involve us in looking at an alternative approach to the question of
solving quintic equations that is associated with the inﬂuential ﬁgures of Hermite,
Kronecker, and Brioschi. Then we consider the alternative promoted by Jordan and
by Felix Klein, whose inﬂuence on the development of Galois theory in the late
nineteenth century is often neglected, but was in fact decisive.
14.2
How to Solve the Quintic Equation
In a celebrated paper of 1858 Hermite showed how to solve the quintic equation.
Not, of course, by radicals, but by the use of functions. He drew an analogy with
cubic equations. The cubic equation with three real roots can always be solved by
trigonometric functions. It is enough to show that any cubic equation can be put in
the form of the equation for sin 3θ in terms of sin θ, in which case the roots of the
cubic equation are the values of sin θ that correspond to the given value of 3θ.
In more detail, we already know that the general cubic equation with real
coefﬁcients can be written in the form
x3 + px + q = 0.

The equation for the trisection of an angle is
s3 −3s/4 + S/4 = 0,
where s = sin θ and S = sin 3θ. We suppose that the value of S is given and use the

If we allow the sine function to be deﬁned by its power series for complex values
and use sin(ix) = i sinh x then the above argument also deals with cubic equations
with only one real root.
Hermite argued that it was already known that any quintic equation can be written
in the two-parameter form
x5 + ax2 + bx + c = 0,
and indeed in the one-parameter form
x5 + bx + c = 0,
which is further reducible to
x5 + x + c = 0
(14.2)
by replacing x with λx. This was the combined result of the German mathematician
Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus in 1683 and the Swedish mathematician Erland
Samuel Bring in 1786, and so Eq. (14.2) is sometimes called Bring’s quintic
equation. Their methods were entirely algebraic, and required no more than the
solution of equations of degree 4.
What Hermite was the ﬁrst to appreciate was that the equation x5 + x + c = 0
had occurred in the theory of elliptic function s. Certain functions f (z) that arise in
this theory satisfy an equation relating f (5x) and f (z), and so, precisely as with the
cubic equation and the sine function, the quintic equation was solved by reducing it
to the theory of this function f .
The precise derivation of the function called f above was difﬁcult, and other
mathematicians, Brioschi and Kronecker, joined in with other approaches, but all
agreed that this rich and unexpected connection between the theory of polynomial
equations and elliptic function s was important. Discovering it, and establishing a
clear route to it, was part of what mathematics was about, in their view.
In what follows I shall sketch how the function f was deﬁned and discovered. It
is not possible to do this without assuming some acquaintance with elliptic function
theory, but what follows is stripped of as many inessentials as possible.

The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
Jacobi’s Equation
Hermite’s work drew on some of the many intriguing formulae that Jacobi had
discovered back in 1828 and 1829 when he and Abel were discovering and
publishing the theory of elliptic function s.
In his (1858) Hermite described what Jacobi had done in this way. He took K
and K′ as the periods of the elliptic integral

with modulus k, that is

K′ =
 π/2
0
dϕ

1 −k′2 sin2 ϕ
,
where k′2 = 1 −k2, and deﬁned ω = iK′/K. Here, K and K′ are thought of as
functions of k.
Jacobi had drawn attention to the fourth root of the modulus and its complement,
so Hermite, after deﬁning these fourth roots
u = ϕ(ω) =
4√
k,
v = ψ(ω) =
4√
k′,
explained that the modular equation relates u and v by an equation of degree n + 1.
To study it further, Hermite introduced the very simple transformation properties
relating ϕ(ω) and ψ(ω) to
ϕ

a + bω

and ψ
c + dω
a + bω

,
where a, b, c, d are integers and ad −bc = 1. Indeed, he said, it is enough to
consider a, b, c, d integers modulo 2, when there are precisely six transformations,
which he exhibited explicitly.
Galois, in his letter to Chevalier, had drawn attention to the striking fact that the
modular equation of degree 6 (as well as those of degrees 8 and 12 but no others)
can be reduced to an equation one degree less.
Of course, this does not mean that the six roots of this equation can be made to
satisfy an equation of degree 5. Rather, Galois had remarked that the ‘group’ of the
modular equation of degree p + 1 is composed of ‘substitutions’ of the form
k
l →ak + bl
ck + dl ,

14.2
How to Solve the Quintic Equation
167
in which k/l can take the p + 1 values ∞, 0, 1, . . . , p −1, and ad −bc is a square.
Reduction will happen if this ‘group’ decomposes into p ‘subgroups’ of 1
2(p −
1)(p + 1) ‘substitutions’, as it does when p = 5. We would say today that the
Galois group in this case acts by conjugation on these ﬁve subgroups, so it is A5,
the Galois group of an equation of degree 5.
This reduction in degree struck Hermite as very important, and he thought that,
although only fragments of Galois’s work on the question remained, it would not
be difﬁcult to rediscover the proof by following the path that he had opened. But,
Hermite said, in that way one is only assured of the possibility of the reduction, and
an important gap remained to be ﬁlled before the problem could be fully solved.
For Hermite, this reduction meant that combinations of the roots of the modular
equation can be found that satisfy a polynomial equation of degree 5, and that is
what he set out to ﬁnd.
The relevant modular equation here is the one for n = 5, which is
u6 −v6 + 5u2v2(u2 −v2) + 4uv(1 −u4v4) = 0.
(14.3)
One is easily led, Hermite remarked, to consider the following function
Φ(ω) =

ϕ(5ω) + ϕ

Then the ﬁve quantities
Φ(ω), Φ(ω + 16), Φ(ω + 2.16), Φ(ω + 3.16), Φ(ω + 4.16)
are the roots of an equation of degree 5 whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of
ϕ(ω), which he exhibited explicitly:

which is an equation in Bring’s form. Better yet, given a speciﬁc value for c in
Bring’s equation, the corresponding value of u turns out to be given by the equation
c =

1 + u8
u2(1 −u8)1/2 ,
and this equation is of degree 4 in u4.
Therefore, and this was the reason for the excitement in 1858, just as the general
cubic equation can be solved by trigonometric functions so the general quintic
equation can be solved by elliptic modular functions and the solution of some

168
14
The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
auxiliary equations of degree at most 4, all of which are solvable by radicals.
Hermite ended his paper with some remarks about how quickly the process of
numerical approximation worked in this case.
Galois did not explain his observation about the reduction in the degree of
Eq. (14.3), and what he did mean was obscure to his contemporaries. It was ﬁrst
explained along Galois’s lines by Betti in his (1853), in a way that did not impress
Hermite if he ever saw it, because he gave the explicit construction just sketched.
Betti ﬁrst of all showed that when p is a prime the equation relating the moduli
of elliptic functions for which transformation s of order p is of degree p + 1. Then
he showed that the (Galois) group of this equation is what would be called today
PGL(2, p) of order (p + 1)(p −1)p that consists of all the transformations
z →αz + β
γ z + δ ,
where α, β, γ, δ are integers modulo p and αδ−βγ is nonzero. Indeed, it is possible
to insist that this determinant αδ −βγ be a square modulo p, which reduces the
group to one of order 1
2(p + 1)(p −1)p. In the case where p = 5, this group is
of order 60 and it acts by conjugation on ﬁve subgroups of order 12, which means
that there is a quintic equation equivalent to the given equation of degree 6, which is
possibly what Galois meant? But Betti showed that the existence of such subgroups
only happens for primes p ≤11, so the reduction is limited to those cases, as Galois
had claimed.
Betti’s proofs were imperfect, but the crucial point to note is that Hermite’s
explanation was explicit and rooted in the theory of elliptic function s and Betti’s
explanation was group-theoretic. Which one should be taken as closer to Galois’s?
Which one is more likely to lead to new discoveries?
14.3
Jordan’s Alternative
Jordan knew the work of Hermite and the others very well but, as we have seen,
embraced and greatly expanded on the concept of a group in a series of papers in
the 1860s that culminated in his Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques
(1870). This was not a matter of ﬁnding different routes to the same goal, but a
confrontation of different approaches. Hermite deployed the considerable resources
of a major branch of contemporary mathematics—elliptic function theory—and
a pleasure in richness and detail. To this Jordan opposed a novel, austere, and
markedly abstract approach—permutation group theory—that had few successes to
its credit.

14.3
Jordan’s Alternative
169
Yet Jordan’s Traité is rightly regarded as a pivotal work by both Kiernan and
Wussing. Kiernan (1971, p. 124) summed up his account of Jordan’s contributions
by saying
JORDAN’S Traité des substitutions marks an important milestone in the development of
algebra and of Galois Theory. . . . The Traité made JORDAN’S research available generally,
in a uniﬁed presentation.
Wussing saw in the Traité the completion of the permutation-theoretic group
concept, and indeed many abstract concepts are developed in Jordan’s work.
Jordan insisted on the importance of the inﬂuence of Galois’s work on his Traité.
“The point of this work”, he wrote in the preface, “is to develop Galois’s methods
and form them into a body of doctrine [theory, perhaps, in English] by showing with
what facility they lead to the solution of all the principal problems in the theory of
equations”. In particular, Jordan took Galois literally: an appreciation of partially
symmetric expressions is not enough, one must look at the groups involved and the
structures they have.
Brechenmacher in his (2011) places the emphasis on all the pages in which
Galois’s name is not mentioned: the material on linear groups, the geometrical
examples, and all but the ﬁrst few pages of Livre IV. This is consistent with his
stressing not “the Galois theory of general equations” (his italics) but rather the three
applications that Galois presented, equations of prime degree, primitive equations
of prime power degree, and modular equations. Brechenmacher’s reading is in some
ways close to Kiernan’s. Kiernan wrote (1971, p. 124)
The ﬁrst two-thirds of the book is ostensibly a development of Galois theory, but often this
is simply a convenient framework for developing innovative, but only incidentally related,
topics in group theory.
But it would be equally fair to recognise the way Jordan took Galois’s ideas and
shaped them into a body of theory. One could argue that the key insight Jordan
took from Galois was that given a problem one should look for the group or groups
it involves. For polynomial equations the adjunction process gives rise to several
groups, and the equation is solvable by radicals if and only if the group is solvable,
so Jordan naturally developed what is lacking in Galois’s fragmentary work: a theory
of solvable groups. This is his theory of composition factors. Every ﬁnite group can
be ﬁngerprinted in this way, and it can only be solvable if the factors are all prime.
Seen in this light, much more of Livre III (and the purpose of Livre IV, but none
of its methods) are exactly in Galois’s spirit. Equally, Galois’s insight into solvable
quintics and almost certainly the modular equation had to do with his appreciation
of linear groups, about which Jordan wrote extensively.1
1It is true that Galois wrote nothing about groups that arise in geometrical settings. One could say
that this was a wholly independent venture on Jordan’s part, or that it is another illustration of
the message that given a problem one should look for a group, whether one reads this as Galois’s
message or Jordan’s. As Jordan pointed out, the geometrical problem is presented in terms of
equations, and these are usually too difﬁcult to deal with explicitly, so it might be propitious to
pass from the equations to the groups.

170
14
The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
On this view, Jordan’s Traité saved Galois’s theory for posterity. If one mastered
the Traité it offered the best explanation of Galois’s ideas: one acquired a theory of
groups, a theoretical grasp of how to translate every term in the theory of equations
into a term in group theory and the language of rationally known quantities, and
one wound up with a rigorous theory in which the parts contributed by Galois stood
out clearly. Much as fragments of a broken statue make good sense in a well-made
reconstruction, Galois’s cryptic remarks made good sense in their new theoretical
setting.
The solution of equations, in whatever form it was regarded, evidently attracted
the attention of a number of major mathematicians who refreshed the subject and
repolished its image. In the context of this book, we must also remember that
Galois’s second Mémoire also began to attract considerable interest and to stimulate
new investigations, including the question much studied by Jordan of primitive
equations and their groups.
But the longer-term fate of Galois theory is reﬂected in the situation between
1870 and the early 1900s. Jordan’s Traité did not displace Serret’s Cours, even as
an account of the theory of polynomial equations, and the reason would seem to
be that it was regarded as being very difﬁcult. Vogt’s book of 1895, which leans
heavily on the equations and only introduces the idea of the group of an equation in
its ﬁnal chapter, was praised by Jules Tannery for presenting an up-to-date account
of the theory based on Kronecker’s insights now that Serret’s book had become out-
of-date, but he noted that Jordan’s book was more appropriate for people wishing
to add to the subject than those hoping to learn it. Jules Tannery was the inﬂuential
Director of Studies at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, so his opinion is a good
measure of attitudes in France, and it suggests that enthusiasm for group theory per
se, and for Jordan’s study of ﬁnite groups of n × n matrices in particular, seems to
have been lacking for some time.2 The ﬁrst book in French to pursue some of these
ideas seems to be de Séguier (1904), which Wussing (1984, p. 272) hailed as ‘The
earliest monograph on group theory’ and a conscious attempt to provide an abstract
account of the subject.3
The long gap from 1870 to 1904 raises the question of what happened elsewhere
in between, and the bulk of the answer lies in Germany and in the work of Kronecker
and Klein. But we should also recall that Poisson rejected the whole thrust of
Galois’s approach by saying that it did not lead to a test using the coefﬁcients of a
given polynomial equation that would permit one to determine whether the equation
was solvable by radicals. This is a signiﬁcant objection, and it is not too much to
say that opinions on it divide Hermite and Kronecker on the one hand from Jordan
and Klein on the other. Indeed, even if it were to be established that Jordan’s Traité
had almost no readers and almost no inﬂuence for decades, there was one person
who appreciated the importance of the idea of a group as vividly as Jordan, and who
applied it energetically to the theory of equations, and that was Klein.

Klein
Christian Felix Klein was born on 25 April, 1849 in Düsseldorf, and went to the
University of Bonn in the autumn of 1865 (at the age of sixteen and a half) intending
to study mathematics and natural sciences and specialise in physics. In Easter 1866
he became an assistant to Julius Plücker, who had become well known for his work
on cathode rays, and helped to set up and carry out demonstrations in his lectures
on experimental physics. Plücker, however, had returned to conducting research in
geometry, which he had been involved with several years before, and Klein also
assisted Plücker with his mathematical researches (Fig. 14.2).
Klein progressed very rapidly, and took his doctorate in December 1868 with
work that extended Plücker’s results. By then Plücker had died, unexpectedly, and
Rudolf Clebsch, an inﬂuential mathematician in his thirties came over from Göttin-
gen to urge upon Klein the task of publishing Plücker’s posthumous geometrical
works. Klein seized the opportunity, which drew him into a circle of algebraic
geometers inspired by Clebsch, and he moved permanently out of physics and into
mathematics.4 Klein then travelled to Paris in 1869 to learn group theory from
Jordan, although his studies were cut short by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian
War, and he used group theory as a guiding principle to shape his view of geometry
from the early 1870s onwards.5

Much of Klein’s work in the 1870s is a response to Jordan’s, and some of it is
indeed a critical response to the treatment of the quintic by Hermite, Brioschi, and

The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
Kronecker. These interests continued with his work on modular groups in the late
1870s when Poincaré emerged and Klein shifted his interests to match those of his
new rival. After the collapse of his health in late 1882, Klein played himself back
into mathematics by writing up some of his old papers in an enlarged and more
carefully explained context, in the form of his book Vorlesungen über das Ikosaeder
und die Auﬂösung der Gleichungen vom fünften Grades (The Icosahedron and the
Solution of Equations of the Fifth Degree, 1884).6
Like those papers, but even more openly, the book is Klein’s claim to Galois’s
mantle; it is his attempt to deﬁne Galois theory for the new generation, and as
such it ran into nothing but opposition (in the form of neglect) from Kronecker,
as we shall see. So it is surprising that Klein is hardly mentioned in Kiernan’s and
Brechenmacher’s accounts, the more so because, as I shall argue, his book did more
than any other work of the period to deﬁne Galois’s legacy for the German, and soon
the English-speaking, world.
14.5
Klein in the 1870s
By 1870 Hermite, Kronecker, and Brioschi were well established mathematicians,
and to most readers their solution to the quintic equation seemed exemplary. Klein
disagreed. For him the connection obscured more than it explained. It might be
interesting that the two ﬁelds were connected, but it could not be the case that the
way to advance the theory of equations led through the rich but complicated domain
of elliptic function theory. He set himself the task of showing the mathematical
world that a more natural, group-theoretic and indeed Galois-theoretic route was at
hand, and in doing so he also set out to marginalise the theory of invariants, which
was then the best way of capturing symmetries of various kinds.
In a series of papers in the 1870s and again in his book on the icosahedron (1884)
he surveyed and rewrote the entire study of the quintic equation in what he explicitly
called Galois theory. He argued that the right way to think about the question is in the
language of group theory, which provides both conceptual clarity and computational
power (through the related topic of invariants). He repeatedly contrasted this
approach with the use of partially symmetric expressions or resolvents used in work
in the late 1850s and early 1860s on the quintic by Hermite, Kronecker, and Brioschi
and argued for the superiority of his approach.
In the paper Klein (1871, p. 1), written shortly after his return from Paris where
he had met Jordan, Klein sketched how “The general theory of algebraic equations
and their resolvents is beautifully illustrated by a number of geometrical examples”.
These, he said, make intuitive the abstract propositions of the theory of substitutions.
6The best modern explanation of the book is the German introduction by Slodowy to the re-edition
of 1993.

14.5
Klein in the 1870s
173
In his (1875) he developed these ideas into a programme for the construction
of all binary forms that are invariant under a group of linear transformation s. He
took as an example the form of degree 12 that represents the vertices of a regular
icosahedron, writing that
I develop it as an example of how the entire theory of these forms can be derived from
a knowledge of the linear transformation s under which they are invariant without any
complicated calculation and only with the ideas of the theory of invariants.7
And he noted a remarkable coincidence, as he put it. The forms he was present-
ing, setting aside their particular signiﬁcance, agreed precisely with those that
Kronecker, Hermite, and above all Brioschi had presented in their studies of the
general equation of degree 5. He returned to this theme in the ﬁnal section of the
paper, where he remarked that all that was new in his paper in this respect was the
interpretation given to the formulae and their associated geometrical derivation.
Klein’s 60-page paper (1877) is almost wholly contained in the book on the
icosahedron, and need not be described in any depth, but some passing remarks are
of interest. He began by saying that it was striking how easy it had proved to derive
the resolvents of degrees 5 and 6 that arise in the theory of the quintic equation and
to recognise their inter-connections, but, he said, it was only after talking to Paul
Gordan—the leading ﬁgure in invariant theory at the time—that it occurred to him to
invert the question and derive the theory of the quintic equation from a consideration
of the icosahedron. Indeed, in close collaboration with Gordan, he said, he had been
led to obtain from a natural source not only all the algebraic theorems and results
that Kronecker and Brioschi had published—sometimes without proof—but also to
introduce essential new ideas. (These concerned the precise use of elliptic functions,
and will not be discussed here.)
The programmatic side of his approach came out again in Klein (1879b, p. 252)
Neither Kronecker nor Brioschi gave any general reason why the Jacobian equations of the
sixth degree appears as the simplest rational resolvent of equations of the ﬁfth degree; as I
regard these Jacobian equations as the bearers of a system of 60 linear ternary substitutions
that is isomorphic with the group of 60 linear permutations of ﬁve things I have held from
the beginning the principle that in every case one can characterise a priori the normal
equations into which the given equations can be transformed by the creation of rational
resolvents.
To understand the subsequent clash between Klein and Kronecker, we may begin
by observing that Kronecker’s work is often technical, and like many a gifted
mathematician when young he did not stoop to making his insights clear and easy to
follow, and would claim to know more than he could prove. This is very clear in his
responses to Galois, which are among his earliest papers. As we have already seen in
Sect. 11.4, Kronecker took a hard line on what counts as a solution. More precisely,
he set some store by his distinction between, on the one hand, adjoining quantities
that belong to the ﬁeld that is obtained by adjoining the roots of a given polynomial
to the ﬁeld determined by the coefﬁcients and on the other hand adjoining algebraic
7Here and below the italics are Klein’s.

174

The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
quantities that do not belong. In fact, he argued that one should properly only
consider the ﬁrst type of adjunctions. He claimed that this was in the spirit of Abel’s
work, and even called it Abel’s postulate.
Klein agreed that this was a valid distinction—he called the ﬁrst case that of
natural irrationalities and the second that of auxiliary irrationalities—but he felt that
both should be explored. This view gained plausibility when Hölder proved in his
(1889) that in order to solve by radicals a cubic equation with rational coefﬁcients
and three real roots it is necessary to adjoin a complex number to the ﬁeld of rational
numbers, so strictly speaking the solution of the cubic must proceed in deﬁance of
Abel’s postulate.8
14.6
Klein’s Icosahedron
Klein’s book is not about the fact that the general quintic equation is not solvable by
radicals. By the 1880s it was well known and understood that this was so and that
the reason was the simplicity of the group A5. All of this was carefully explained
in Jordan’s Traité. Rather, Klein’s book is about every aspect of the theory of
the quintic equation, but most obviously and importantly its solution by previous
authors that Klein felt left a lot to be explained. In passing, Klein showed how
to rederive their results by methods he had introduced in the 1870s. But his main
aim was to show that the geometry of the icosahedron, its symmetry group and its
subgroups, and the corresponding theory of forms provided a better explanation of
what was involved by being more natural and direct. He also added some further
geometrical considerations that illuminated other aspects of the rival methods.
Klein began by explaining the idea of a group, and then turned to the example of
the regular solids
I.1 §1 As soon as we enter upon the task of studying the rotations, etc. in question, by
which the conﬁgurations which we have mentioned are transformed into themselves, we
are compelled to take into account the important and comprehensive theory which has
been principally established by the pioneering works of Galois, and which we term the
group-theory. Originally sprung from the theory of equations, and having a corresponding
relation with the permutations of any kind of elements, this theory includes, as has long
been recognised, every question with which we are concerned in the case of a closed
manifoldness of any kind of operations.
In particular, this was Klein’s way of treating the resolvents of an equation.
I.4 §1: A ﬁrst and important portion of this theory, which distinguishes the nature of the
resolvents coming generally under consideration, is formed by those reﬂections which, in
accordance with the fundamental ideas of Galois, are usually denoted by his name, and
which amount to characterising the individual equation, or system of equations, by a certain
group of interchanges of the corresponding solutions.
8This is the irreducible case discussed in Sect. 9.4.

14.6
Klein’s Icosahedron
175
But
it is not sufﬁcient in any given algebraical problem to know the nature of the resolvents;
we require, further, to actually calculate these resolvents, and this in the simplest manner.
The second part of the present chapter is concerned with this, with strict limitation to the
questions immediately surrounding our fundamental problems. I show, ﬁrst of all (§7), how
we can actually construct the auxiliary resolvents by means of which the solution of the
dihedral, tetrahedral, and octahedral equation is to be achieved. I concern myself, then, in
detail with the resolvents of the ﬁfth and sixth degrees of the icosahedral equation (§§8–
15).9
The whole subject of resolvents was, for Klein, equivalent to the study of
subgroups of a given group. In I.4 §3 Klein offered what he called some general
remarks concerning a group G that is the group of an equation. He supposed that G
is of order N and that there is a rational function R0 which is unaltered by a group
g0 of ν of the permutations in G and so takes only n′ = N/ν values, say
R0, . . . , Rn′.
Then
(R −R0) . . .(R −Rn′)
is invariant under every permutation, and is a resolvent for the group. Then Klein
observed that the conjugates of g0 in G give rise to other resolvents, and that “There
are as many different kinds of resolvents of the proposed equation f (x) = 0 as
there exist different systems of associate [conjugate] subgroups within the group
G”. The group of the resolvent Klein called Γ , and he showed that there is map
from G onto Γ , and that this map is an isomorphism when there are permutations in
G that ﬁx every Rj, and they form a self-conjugate (i.e. normal) subgroup γ of G. If
no such subgroup γ exists the original equation is a resolvent of the resolvent, and
nothing is gained by replacing the equation f (x) = 0 by its resolvent other than a
restatement of the problem. But in the other case the new group—which we would
call the quotient Γ/γ —is smaller and the problem of ﬁnding the roots of f (x) = 0
is broken into two smaller problems. “Clearly”, Klein concluded, “the resolvents of
the second kind are the more important”.
Klein then analysed the Galois resolvent from this point of view, until he could
conclude at the end of §5 that
If, then, for such an equation, a rational function of the roots is constructed which remains
unaltered for the permutation Sk of a certain sub-group contained in the Galois group,
and thus can be introduced as a root of a corresponding resolvent, it is sufﬁcient to
establish a rational function of the single root R0, which will, for the corresponding ψks, be
9As noted above, invariant theory contains standard mechanisms for generating one invariant from
another, such as the Hessian of a form and the functional determinant of two forms. Applied to the
form that speciﬁes the 12 vertices of the icosahedron, the Hessian locates the 20 mid-face points
and the functional determinant of the ﬁrst form and its Hessian locate the 30 mid-edge points.

176
14
The Galois Theory of Hermite, Jordan and Klein
transformed into itself; for the sub-group of the ψks contains at the same time all the (ψ−1
k )s,
and, therefore, corresponds to the sub-group of the Sks in the isomorphic co-ordination.
In I.4 §5 he went on
I have framed the foregoing paragraph in such detail in order to be able to now marshal
directly our fundamental equations in the scheme of the Galois theory, to wit, the binomial
equations and the equations of the dihedron, tetrahedron, octahedron, and, icosahedron. Let
us ﬁrst agree that our equations are irreducible. From the considerations in the last chapter,
based on the function theory, it follows, that the N-function branches, which are deﬁned by
the individual equations, on regarding in each case the right-side Z as independent variable,
are all connected with one another. Therefore the hypotheses are exactly fulﬁlled, to which
the concluding theorem of the preceding paragraph relates.
With this in place Klein proceeded to trace the solution of the quartic equation
through a chain of subgroups each normal in the one before, and to show that a
quintic equation is not solvable by radicals when its group is that of the icosahedron.
Looking ahead to new problems, he wrote
I.5 §4 If we are concerned with the solution of an equation of the nth degree f (x) = 0, we
can regard it as being the same as if a form-problem for the n variables x0, x1, . . . , xn−1
(i.e., the roots of the equation) were proposed to us. The group of the corresponding linear
substitutions will be simply formed by those permutations of the xs which make up the
“Galois group” of the equation; the forms F coincide with the complete system of those
integral functions of the xs which, in the sense of the Galois theory, ﬁgure as “rationally
known”. With these remarks, nothing, of course, is primarily altered in the substance of the
theory of equations. But the theorems to be developed in it acquire a new arrangement.
Nobody would write a whole book to establish that the general quintic equation
is not solvable by radicals. So what was Klein doing? The answer, as he made very
clear, is showing in complete detail how conceptual methods can almost completely
replace the previous heavy reliance on calculations. For example, that talk of an
expression taking only ﬁve values can be replaced by talk of a form connected to
a subgroup of the icosahedral group. As to the detail necessary, Klein had to show
that precisely the equations introduced in the other methods arise in his approach,
but more naturally. To do this, he showed that the subgroups of the icosahedral
group, and the invariant forms associated with them, lead in readily comprehensible
ways to exactly those equations, and therefore that there is a systematic approach
which directs the calculations and can even eliminate them entirely. Furthermore,
Klein hoped to show that this approach is the very essence of Galois’s: involving
equations as the outward sign of groups and rationally known quantities, and taking
explanation away from calculation and towards conceptual arguments.

If f is suitably deﬁned it becomes a complex analytic function of z—an elliptic

1. If you were a well-trained mathematician of the 1860s, and therefore familiar
with elliptic function theory, would your sympathies be with Galois and Betti
over the right way to explain the reduction of the modular equation, or with
Hermite, Kronecker, and Brioschi? Why?
2. Is it reasonable to see the attitudes of Jordan and Klein to Galois theory as a
generational shift in mathematics? What is involved in making such a claim?
What other such shifts might have occurred in the nineteenth century?

What Is ‘Galois Theory’?
15.1
Introduction
At this point, one could legitimately wonder if the story of Galois theory was not
essentially over. The general question of which polynomial equations are solvable
by radicals has been turned into a question about which groups are solvable, which
is a perfectly good theoretical resolution of the problem even if it leaves it open in
any particular case—but then, how important has it ever been to solve an equation
by radicals? Has not the original topic become just one of a number of topics in the
emerging topic of ﬁnite group theory?
The process of successive adjunctions of auxiliary irrationals has also been
spelled out fully. From a certain, later, perspective this is surely a question about
ﬁnite extensions of the ﬁeld of rational numbers, and if we look ahead to the work of
Dedekind that is exactly what we see being developed. Once again, the original topic
has seemingly been subsumed in a much larger and more diverse one, in this case
with connections to cyclotomy and other emerging branches of algebraic number
theory.
Something must be wrong, or no one would speak of ‘Galois theory’ today,
whatever they might mean by it. People would speak of group theory, with an
application to the theory of ﬁelds; or of ﬁeld theory, with an application to the
theory of groups; or of the solution of equations from a group-theoretic perspective.
An explanation of the high status of Galois theory requires us to understand how it
came to be regarded as an exemplary union of both group theory and ﬁeld theory.
If we set the reputation of its titular founder aside, we can begin by looking to see
who promoted this uniﬁed point of view, and how well they got on.

What Is ‘Galois Theory’?
15.2
Klein’s Inﬂuence
We have already seen that a signiﬁcant place in the theory of equations was occupied
by the solution of the quintic equation by means of elliptic functions. This drew on a
major topic of the day, and was seen as an advance on what Galois had done; better
to have solutions of a certain kind than simply proclaim that there are no solutions
of a certain other kind. In this spirit, Jordan had even shown that there was a related
class of functions capable of expressing the solution to polynomial equations of
any degree. It could be objected that the calculation of tables of values for these
functions presented considerable difﬁculties, but then the whole business was rather
abstract: the market for solutions of speciﬁc quintic equations was very small.
The alternative promoted obscurely by Galois and explicitly by Jordan and Klein
made essential use of a new and abstract concept, that of the permutation group.
In this context, a remark by Paul Bachmann in Mathematische Annalen (1881) is
worth exhibiting, because it shows how radical Klein’s position was.1
In spite of the fact that new editors, chief among them Herr C. Jordan [Bachmann has
in mind Jordan’s second Galois commentary [. . . ] (Wussing)], have brought Galois’s
investigations of the algebraic solvability of equations closer to the common understanding,
many may be deterred from the study of this principal part of the subject of equations by
their extensive use of the very abstract substitution theory. Such persons may well welcome
the present exposition of the subject which avoids the said theory as much as the nature
of things allows, and bases itself essentially on the two fundamental concepts of ﬁeld and
irreducibility. We believe that this treatment, due, incidentally, to Herr Dedekind, gives a far
more concrete view of the phases of the solution process of equations than the usual mode
of presentation.
We shall look in more detail below at the split between the views of Kronecker
and his former student Netto on the one hand and those of Dedekind, Weber and
their followers on the other, but there was a strong preference for emphasising the
successive adjunction side of the story, which Dedekind and Weber wrote up in the
language of ﬁelds that they were developing.
But the quotation makes it clear that for its young author, and perhaps also for
the editors of the fairly new journal (founded in 1869), substitution theory is very
abstract, perhaps too abstract. There were isolated papers in German on the subject,
but no book or other full-length account from which the subject could be learned and
its priorities and importance assessed. That was to change with the publication of
Netto’s book in 1882, as we shall see in Chap. 27. But throughout the 1870s Klein’s
espousal of group theory was more radical, and perhaps more risky, than is often
suggested.
Klein, unlike Jordan, wanted to push the role of elliptic function theory to
one side. As we have seen, he argued strongly that the natural approach was to

Klein’s Inﬂuence

work with the icosahedron and the group of permutations of ﬁve objects, and not
with an equation which happens to turn up in another domain of mathematics. He
never remarked that the route from trigonometric functions to elliptic function s
was a natural one, and he managed instead to suggest that Hermite, Brioschi, and
Kronecker had not even used elliptic function theory as elegantly as they should
have done. In many a less scientiﬁc context such rhetoric would have been taken
as an ad hominem attack, as perhaps it was. There is no doubt that Kronecker held
a very poor opinion of Klein. Petri and Schappacher (2002, p. 245) remind us that
in a letter from the 1880s Kronecker dismissed Klein as a “Faiseur”—a maker of
superﬁcial phrases.2 Equally, it is clear that Klein found Kronecker’s treatment of
his work unfair—as Petri and Schappacher show that it surely was—and attributed
it to what he saw as a growing dogmatism in Kronecker (Klein was to make this
something of an orthodoxy later in Göttingen). The failure of Kronecker to publish
proofs of many of his results can only have annoyed Klein still more.
Kronecker’s opposition to Klein was based on his marked dislike of general
theorems that lacked concrete detail. The ideal, for him, was a theorem that would
determine from the coefﬁcients of a quintic equation alone if the equation was
solvable by radicals. The transition to a discussion of groups, however interesting
on other grounds, did nothing if it was not possible to determine the group of the
equation. That being a task left unaddressed by Jordan and Klein, Kronecker saw
their contributions as failing to achieve the required goal.
Klein’s view was that calculations should proceed from a transparent base in a
conceptually explicit way, and arguably that one might prefer conceptual arguments
to computational ones. Today we talk about this difference in approaches as a battle
between frogs and birds: Kronecker is a frog, never happier than when in the middle
of things; Klein is a bird, offering the grand overview. In such questions there is
usually right on both sides, and which way a mathematician goes seems to be a
matter of temperament. We shall return below to the question of why Kronecker’s
strictures were often ignored. Here, we shall note that Klein’s inﬂuence on the
spread of Galois theory was considerable, and can be found in the work of Weber,
Bolza, and Wiman.
If we look at Weber’s Lehrbuch der Algebra (1896) Volume 2, Book 3, we
see a heavily Kleinian presentation from a mathematician who was often close to
Kronecker. The earlier books presented general group theory, which was growing
into a rich subject, and an account of linear groups, much of which prepares the
way for Book 3. That book opens with an account of resolvents associated to a
composition series, metacyclic equations, and equations of degrees 6, 7, and 8. Then
come the geometric examples that Jordan had discussed in his Traité, a Kleinian
treatment of the quintic, and ﬁnally two chapters on the group PSL(2, 7) that Klein
had written about at length in his (1879).
Oscar Bolza had been driven by a downturn in the German economy to become
one of the ﬁrst Professors of mathematics at the new University of Chicago. He

had been largely educated in Berlin in physics before turning to mathematics and
studying in Strasburg and then spending a difﬁcult year with Klein. Then, as Parshall
and Rowe say in their (1994, 200) when Bolza embarked on a career in the new
University of Chicago “[a]rmed with nothing more than a letter of introduction from
Klein”, he “became an effective and versatile propagator of Klein’s mathematics”.
E.T. Bell reported that Bolza’s lectures “did much to popularise the subject and to
acquaint young Americans with the outlines of the Galois theory of equations”.3 His
account, which appeared in two papers in the American Journal of Mathematics in
1891, is the ﬁrst account in English. It is based, as he said, on the books by Serret,
Jordan, and Netto, papers by Kronecker and others, and particularly on lectures that
Klein had given in Göttingen in 1886.
Bolza led off with the theory of groups, and explained about groups, subgroups,
conjugate and self-conjugate subgroups. He explained the effect of adjoining an
irrational in terms of the effect on the Galois group, and this is used to explain
how the solution of cubic and quartic equations proceeds, and in particular why the
quartic equation is solved by solving a cubic equation but not a pure cubic equation.
This in turn is used to explain how the self-conjugate subgroups of prime index p
correspond to the solution of pure binomial equations of the form xp −α = 0. Bolza
was then in a position to examine the decomposition of the symmetric groups of
low degree, and to appeal to their composition series to decide if the corresponding
equation is solvable by radicals. This section of the paper ends with a hint of the
rich content of Klein’s recent book (1884) on the icosahedron.
In the second part of his paper Bolza gave a general treatment of Galois theory,
by which he meant the case where a speciﬁc equation and expressions in its roots
(considered as numbers) is at issue, as opposed to the case where the roots are
indeterminates—passing from Lagrange to Galois, so to speak. In particular, Bolza
looked at the study of equations whose groups are cyclic, abelian, or metacyclic,
and showed that they are always solvable by radicals.4
After writing this article, Bolza reviewed the English translation of Netto (1882),
and found fault with the account of Galois theory. He felt that Netto had not
understood the subtleties in Galois’s distinction between treating the roots of an
equation as symbols and treating them as numbers. He gave the example of the
equation
x4 + 1 = 0,
with roots
x1 = ε, x2 = iε, x3 = −ε, x4 = −iε, where ε = eiπ/4.
3Quoted in Parshall and Rowe (1994, 201).
4Recall that the metacyclic case is the one in which all the roots are rational functions of any two
of them; the best case is binomial equations.

15.2
Klein’s Inﬂuence
183
The expressions x2
1 and x2x4 are distinct but numerically equal (to i). The expression
x2
1 is formally invariant under the group H isomorphic to S3 that permutes 2, 3, 4;
the expression x2x4 is invariant under a different group. Moreover, the permutations
of the symbols x1, x2, x3, x4 that leave x2
2 = i invariant are twelve in number and
do not form a group.5
The group of the equation over the rational numbers is in fact
G = {1, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.
The expression x1x2
2 + x3x2
4 = 0 so it is rationally known, but it is not formally
unchanged by G. The resolution of this seeming paradox, said Bolza, is that every
expression that is numerically invariant under the group can be rewritten so that it
is formally invariant as well. He then gave the simpler resolution, which is more
obviously in line with Galois’s original idea, that concentrates on the permutations
of the actual roots, and forgets about the formal expressions altogether. It quickly
becomes clear in the present case that looking at what can happen to ε shows that
the group is the one just given. In this case, the substitutions in G that leave x2
1 = i
unchanged are the identity and (13)(24) and they form a subgroup of G.
Bolza, following Klein, gave a good explanation of the adjunction of natural
and of accessory irrationals. A natural irrational is a numerical value of a rational
expression in the roots. Adjoining one, as Galois said, reduces the group of the
equation to the group H that leaves the expression invariant; in the case of G above
i is a natural irrational, and adjoining it, as we saw, reduces the group of the equation
to {1, (13)(24)}. If moreover the group H is self-conjugate (we would say normal)
then the group of the equation that the natural irrational satisﬁes is the quotient
group, G/H.6
The effect of adjoining an auxiliary irrational is covered by Jordan’s theorem on
the simultaneous adjunction of all the roots of f (x) = 0 to the equation g(x) = 0
and of all the roots of g(x) = 0 to the equation f (x) = 0. This says that if the group
of the equation f (x) = 0 is reduced in this way, then the roots of g(x) = 0 are
rational functions of the roots of f (x) = 0. In other words, the adjoined roots are
natural after all.
Klein reinforced his inﬂuence on the development of Galois theory in the United
States when he went there in 1893, and we can note that Klein’s icosahedron book
was translated into English in 1888, Netto’s in 1892. Both were published in the
United States ﬁrst, not Britain. Brechenmacher’s description of the Dickson network
makes clear numerous other ways in which Klein’s inﬂuence, although not his alone,
was spreading.

6In modern terms, a natural irrational lies in the splitting ﬁeld of the original polynomial.

184
15
What Is ‘Galois Theory’?
Hölder’s two-part article ‘Galois theory with applications’ (Hölder 1899) for
the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften and Wiman’s article ‘Finite
groups of linear substitutions’ in the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wis-
senschaften (Wiman 1900) (see Chap. 15 below) are obviously much inﬂuenced by
Klein. It will be enough to look at Hölder’s. Part 1 opens with the deﬁnition of
the group of an equation and some general remarks about such groups, including
an indication of how to construct them explicitly by ﬁnding a primitive element.
The concepts of transitivity and primitivity are explained, followed by an account
of the adjunction of natural irrationals, cyclic equations (the corresponding Galois
group is cyclic), pure equations (those of the form xn −a = 0), factorisation
through the construction of resolvents, with an indication of the role of a normal
subgroup, adjunction of accessory irrationals, and of radicals. The idea of a solution
by radicals is then explained, with criteria for solvability, and ﬁnally some remarks
are made about equations that are not solvable. Overall, the treatment largely follows
Jordan’s Traité and Hölder (1889), in which he proved the Jordan–Hölder theorem
and applied it to Galois theory.
Part 2 covers the applications. It opens with a deﬁnition of the general equation,
then looks in detail at equations of the ﬁrst four degrees, the unsolvability of the
general equation of higher degree (the argument rests on the simplicity of An, n >
4), equations with regular groups (those for which all the roots are rational in any
one), equations with commutative groups, abelian equations, cyclotomic equations.
Then it looks at a topic begun by Abel, the division and transformation by elliptic
functions, then at reduction of modular equations to normal form, and equations
of prime degree. After that came an indication of how Sylow’s theorems can be
used to determine whether a group is solvable, the irreducible case of the cubic, line
and circle constructions, and ﬁnally geometric equations connected to curves and
surfaces possessing symmetries.
Only six books are cited: by Serret, Jordan, Petersen, Netto, Vogt, and Weber’s
Lehrbuch der Algebra (which we discuss in Chap. 22). Petersen’s book (1877) in
Danish was translated into German the next year and was closely modelled on
Serret’s Cours with, as the author said, information on substitution groups taken
from Jordan’s Traité.7
For whatever reason, Hölder did not mention the book (Borel and Drach 1895)
on the theory of numbers and higher algebra. It carries a warm-hearted introduction
by Jules Tannery, in which he speaks of having given lectures to third-year students
at the École Normale in 1891–1892 in the hope of engaging their interest in various
problems, and says that now indeed two students “who are certainly among the
most distinguished of those that I have had the honour and pleasure to meet” are the
authors of this book.
Number theory is presented ﬁrst as a theory of congruences modulo a prime,
and the theory of ‘Galois imaginaries’ is introduced, without the term ﬁnite ﬁeld

being used or indeed implied.8 Quadratic congruences lead up to the theorem of
quadratic reciprocity; Kronecker’s proof of it is given. The treatment concludes with
the introduction of the Gaussian integers and some brief remarks about quadratic
forms.
Higher algebra was taken to mean polynomial algebra, algebraic numbers and
algebraic integers, all of which led to a chapter on substitution groups, another on
the algebraic solution of equations and solvable groups, and ﬁnally one on normal
equations and abelian equations.9
Galois theory is therefore presented as a theory of the solution of polynomial
equations, in which older material about rational expressions is repackaged as
being about subgroups of the symmetric group, and the subject is pointed towards
equations having particularly tractable groups. The examples of equations of low
degree is not given, but nor is there much inﬂuence of the abstract approach of
Dedekind. Rather, the account can be read as a simpliﬁed presentation of some of
Jordan’s ideas illuminated with some of Kronecker’s explicit methods.
Finally, we should not neglect the question of ﬁnding the ‘Galois group’ of a
given equation. To this day there is no algorithm that will take the coefﬁcients
of a polynomial and determine the Galois group of the corresponding equation.
Instead, there is a method that for equations of low degree will quickly give enough
information for the group to be found. It works very well for equations up to
degree 8, and thereafter requires a little more patience as alternative possibilities can
arise that can be difﬁcult to distinguish. It has now been improved and applied to
determine all the Galois groups of equations of degree less than 20.10 The limitations
have as much to do with the limitations on computing power as anything else.
The method is described in many places, for example (Cox 2004, ed. 2012)
and K. Conrad,11 but the original source is seldom given. It was discovered by
Dedekind, and can be found in his Mathematische Werke 2, 414–415, as part of
a letter to Frobenius of 8 June 1882. The problem of attribution seems to be that
Frobenius himself forgot that he had read it, and raised it as a conjecture in a
letter to Dedekind. When Dedekind reminded him that the ‘conjecture’ was already
a theorem, Frobenius published the information, along with Dedekind’s proof, in
his paper of 1896. The story was picked up by I. Schur in his paper (1920), and
this seems to be the source of the information that most recent authors have used;
the relevant part of the Dedekind–Frobenius correspondence was only published in
1931.
8See Chap. 23 below, where it is explained that these are roots of polynomial equations with
coefﬁcients taken modulo a prime; in modern terms algebraic extensions of a ﬁnite ﬁeld.
9An equation was said to be normal if each root of it is expressible as a polynomial function with
integer coefﬁcients of any one of them.

15
What Is ‘Galois Theory’?
Dedekind’s “very lovely” theorem, as Schur and many after him have called it,
says that if an irreducible polynomial f (x) of degree n is interpreted as a polynomial
with coefﬁcients modulo a prime p and if as such it factorises as a product of distinct
polynomials of degrees d1, d2, . . . , dk, and none of these polynomial factors are
multiple, then the Galois group of the original polynomial has an element of cycle
type d1, d2, . . . , dk. Enough information of this kind for small primes can swiftly
reduce the candidates for the Galois group to a unique possibility. In particular, it
can make it possible to say whether the group is the full permutation group Sn, which
is one of the tasks Schur had in mind. More generally, the theorem has implications
for the so-called inverse Galois problem: ﬁnd which groups can be exhibited as the
Galois group of an extension of the rational numbers.
15.3
Concluding Remarks
In their rich rewriting of the consequences of Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
Goldstein and Schappacher argue for an endless process of selecting, re-presenting,
and rearranging of the different parts of Gauss’s book. The content, they write, has
at times deﬁned the subject, at times been cut and reshaped. They see the history of
the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in the 19th century in a new way, as an endlessly
shifting collection of readings, of textual transmissions, of the transfer of knowledge
between and especially across generations—and they reject the idea that a period of
awe was followed by the steady accumulation of disciples until modern number
theory was created around 1900.
Just so, every powerful mathematician involved in the responses to Galois’s work
between 1846 and 1900 made a selection of it, emphasised aspects and marginalised
others, and then made contributions that changed what ‘Galois theory’ could be said
to be. Kiernan was right to trace an arc from Lagrange to Artin at a time when
that story was not well known, and right to bring to it ﬁgures whose contributions
were no longer well known. In that story, Jordan’s Traité is important, and Artin’s
re-writing of the subject provides a natural terminus. Brechenmacher is right to
challenge that arc, to try to fracture it by attending more closely to Galois’s speciﬁc
contributions, and by looking more carefully at who read what; in short, to make
‘Galois theory’ many things that form not a set package that grew down the decades
but a shifting family of ideas that evolved in many different ways.
In the 1850s, Hermite’s response to Galois was rooted in the theory of elliptic
function s that he loved, and in the deep attention to detail that he believed was
essential to mathematics as a research activity. In this, as so often, he stood close to
Kronecker, and to Brioschi. Kronecker saw his contributions as being much more
inspired by Abel than Galois. In the 1890s, Moore, Dickson, and others saw their
work as responding to a different part of Galois’s; in their case to his paper (Galois
1830) and the theory they wished to present of ﬁnite ﬁelds. Galois had seen his paper
as an extension of Gauss’s work on cyclotomy to a new family of imaginaries.

15.3
Concluding Remarks
187
How different should we see these approaches as being? Cyclotomic equations
of prime degree remained throughout the 19th century as one of the canonical
examples of equations that are solvable by radicals and Gauss’s proof that they are,
with its enumerations of cosets of subgroups of the appropriate cyclic group, looks
like abelian Galois theory. Or perhaps one should say that after Galois, it was clear
to Jordan that cyclotomy was an elementary part of Galois theory.
Kiernan’s arc prevents us from seeing many things; events are tidied up, people
are made to face forward. But we should also admit that room was made for
other points of view, such as Kronecker’s, and distinctions are made between,
for example, what Galois did and what Jordan did, and between group-focussed
accounts (typically French) and ﬁeld-centred accounts (typically German). If we
interpret Galois’s work as advocating the merits of thinking about groups (whatever
they might be) as a way to make conceptual progress in the face of mounting
computational difﬁculties, then we must surely see Jordan and Klein as promoting
that view, and in Klein’s case succeeding to a considerable degree.

Chapter 16
Algebraic Number Theory: Cyclotomy
16.1
Introduction
We return to one of Gauss’s favourite themes, cyclotomic integers, and look at how
they were used by Kummer, one of the leaders of the next generation of German
number theorists. French and German mathematicians did not keep up-to-date with
each other’s work, and for a brief, exciting moment in Paris in 1847 it looked as
if the cyclotomic integers offered a chance to prove Fermat’s last theorem, only
for Kummer to report, via Liouville, that problems with the concept of a prime
cyclotomic integer wrecked that hope. Primality, however, turned out to be a much
more interesting concept, and one of the roots of the concept of an ideal.
16.2
Kummer’s Cyclotomic Integers
Although cyclotomic integers were to be used in the study of Fermat’s last theorem,
Kummer, who knew more about them than anybody else, apparently took them up
with a view to the study of higher reciprocity laws. He began by looking for the
factors of cyclotomic integers of the simplest form, namely binomials, cyclotomic
integers of the form x + αjy, where he has ﬁxed a prime p and α is a primitive pth
root of unity: the lowest positive power n such that αn = 1 is p. We can follow what
he did if we are prepared to take some correct mathematics on trust (if you are not,
consult Chapter 4 of Edwards 1977).
Kummer said that one cyclotomic integer h(α) divides another, f (α), if there is
a third, g(α), such that f (α) = h(α)g(α). A cyclotomic integer is prime if every
time it divides a product it divides one of the factors. Because the norm of a product
is the product of the norms, a factor of a cyclotomic integer has a norm that divides
the norm of the given cyclotomic integer. Cyclotomic integers of norm 1 are called

units and they divide every cyclotomic integer, so they are ignored when division is
of interest.
Unfortunately, cyclotomic integers are unwieldy things. Kummer took a prime
p and a primitive pth root of unity, α, and deﬁned a cyclotomic integer to be an
expression of the form
a0 + a1α + . . . + ap−1αp−1,
where the aj are ordinary integers. Minor irritation is caused by the fact that the
identity 1 + α + . . . + αp−1 = 0 implies that
a0 + a1α + . . . + ap−1αp−1 = (a0 + c) + (a1 + c)α + . . . + (ap−1 + c)αp−1,
for any integer c. To minimise the irritation this causes one can always insist that
the term in αp−1 has coefﬁcient zero.
Kummer deﬁned the norm of the cyclotomic integer a0+a1α+. . .+ap−1αp−1 =
f (α) to be
Nf (α) = f (α)f (α2) . . . f (αp−1),
and said he took the term from Dirichlet’s work. The cyclotomic integers f (αj) he
called the conjugates of f (α). This precisely generalises what we do when ﬁnding
the norm of a Gaussian integer—we multiply it by its conjugate—but at a rising cost
as p increases. Even to compute the norm of a cyclotomic integer when p = 7 is
tiresome if not done on a computer, so the examples are toy examples.
Exercise. Let p = 3. Compute the norm of the cyclotomic integer f (α) = 3 −
7α + 2α2 = 1 −9α as follows:
•
write f (α) = 1 −9α;
•
f (α2) = 1 −9α2 = 10 + 9α;
•
compute the norm, which is the product
f (α)f (α2) = (1 −9α)(10 + 9α) = 10 −81α −81α2 = 91.
Now, 91
=
7 · 13, and because, for any prime p, N(f (α)g(α))
=
N(f (α))N(g(α)), it follows that either f (α) = 3 −7α + 2α2 is irreducible or
its factors have norms 7 and 13.
Given f (α) = x + αjy, with x and y integers, how does one ﬁnd its divisors?
Kummer argued as follows. Let h = h(α) be a divisor of f = f (α), then the norm
of h divides the norm of f , which is an integer. This imposes a severe constraint on
what h can be.

16.2
Kummer’s Cyclotomic Integers
191
Next, Kummer let h be a prime cyclotomic integer. Now it follows that h itself
divides N(f ), the norm of f . Therefore h divides at least one of the prime factors
of N(f ). Kummer was able to show that in fact all the integers that h divides are
multiples of p. Continuing in this fashion, he was able to show that N(h) is itself
a prime integer congruent to 0 or 1 mod p, and in fact that, conversely, if h is a
cyclotomic integer whose norm is a prime integer then h = h(α) is itself prime and
it divides a binomial x + αjy.
Here are two examples, taken from not Kummer’s work but Lamé’s, that we shall
need later (they are given in Edwards 1977, 86). The prime is p = 5.
1. N(α + 2) = 11. This says α + 2 is prime; that a cyclotomic integer g(α) is
divisible by α + 2 if and only if g(−2) ≡0 mod 11; and that 11 is a product of
four factors (α + 2 and its three conjugates).
2. N(α + 4) = 5 · 41. This says that α + 4 is a product of a factor of norm 5 and
one of norm 41. It turns out that the only factors of norm 5 are units times α −1,
because here p = 5, and α + 4 = (α −1)α2(3α2 + 2α + 1). Since α2 is a unit it
must be that N(3α2 + 2α + 1) = 41 and 3α2 + 2α + 1 is prime.
Here’s the ﬁrst one in detail (I leave the second one as an instructive exercise).
N(α + 2) = (α + 2)(α2 + 2)(α3 + 2)(α4 + 2) =
(α + 2)(α4 + 2)(α2 + 2)(α3 + 2) = (α5 + 2α2 + 2α + 4)(α5 + 2α3 + 2α2 + 4) =
(2α4 + 2α + 5)(2α3 + 2α2 + 5),
because α5 = 1. It is now helpful to proceed by collecting like powers of α:
α4
α3
α2
α1
α0 = 1
10
4
4
4

10

25
The product is therefore 14α4 + 14α3 + 14α2 + 14α + 25, but this is the same
cyclotomic integer as the one obtained by reducing every coefﬁcient by 14, and that
is the ordinary integer 11, so the norm of α + 2 is N(α + 2) = 11.
Kummer worked extensively in this fashion, weeks of tedious but not actually
difﬁcult work looking for prime cyclotomic integers, for successive values of the
prime p. Eventually in 1844 he published a table of prime factorisations of all
primes q ≡1 mod p in the range p ≤19, q < 1000. (The table is reproduced
in Edwards 1977, pp. 102–103.) Up to this stage he had found prime factors
corresponding to every value of the norm that turned up, and he was surely
beginning to relax. Time, perhaps, to look for a theorem: all cyclotomic integers
can be factorised (uniquely up to order) into prime cyclotomic integers?

192

Algebraic Number Theory: Cyclotomy
Then came the case p = 23, the next prime after 19. The prime number 47 =
2 · 23 + 1 is a possible norm, but the techniques Kummer had available for ﬁnding
a prime cyclotomic integer with norm 47 failed. More precisely, he showed that
when p = 23 there is no cyclotomic integer with norm 47 at all! So the uniqueness
of prime factorisation fails for 47, not because uniqueness fails but because there
are no primes at all that are factors of 47. It is not itself prime, but it has no prime
factors—a very unexpected turn of events.1
Kummer then observed that the test for divisibility could be made to work even
when there are provably no factors for which it tests. He pursued this idea through
the unstudied cases where q ̸≡0, 1 mod p, which took a further 2 years, 1844–
1846. It led him to the idea that there are tests for congruence modulo a cyclotomic
integer that reduce to congruence questions modulo a rational prime, and these tests
always give answers. They can therefore be said to determine a congruence relation
on cyclotomic integers with this property: a product is congruent to 0 if and only
if one of its factors is congruent to 0. The tests amount to asking ‘If p divides a
product, does it divide one of the factors of that product?’.
He interpreted this as meaning that the rational prime p remains prime or factors
in a given family of cyclotomic integers if and only if the congruence tests say
that p is congruent to zero. When this happens he said that p remains prime. But
if not, he said that p was no longer prime—even when he can also show that it
has no cyclotomic integers as factors! He considered that p then had ideal factors.
He could now claim that a cyclotomic integer is determined by its (possibly ideal)
prime divisors because questions about the multiplication and division of cyclotomic
integers have solid answers via the tests.
Kummer published his theory in 1847. Curiously, the paper has two gaps, which
he only ﬁlled in a note of 1857, and that note rather over-estimated how much
Kummer had done in the ﬁrst paper while still under-estimating what had to be
done with the second gap. Since these gaps concern the inner workings of the theory,
albeit in a crucial way, they will not be discussed. The fact that they can be ﬁlled
means that their existence did not signiﬁcantly affect the development of the theory.
Kummer’s student Kronecker regarded cyclotomic integers as quotients of the
polynomial ring Z(α) by (here we must add some words—the ideal generated by)
αp −1. This makes it clear that the algebra of cyclotomic integers is very like the
algebra of polynomials with integer coefﬁcients, but it does nothing to illuminate
the number-theoretical questions with which we are occupied.
Kummer’s theory accomplished several signiﬁcant things. It shattered any naive
conﬁdence in the idea that algebraic integers would behave like rational integers
when it came to multiplication and division. It showed that a rigorous theory of
algebraic integers (admittedly, only the cyclotomic integers) could be created. It
introduced into mathematics the idea that ideal objects could be created to rescue a
theory.
1In later terminology, this means that the factors of 47 are all ideal.

16.3
Fermat’s Last Theorem in Paris
In 1847, before Kummer’s discoveries became widely known, they caused a wild
ﬂurry of interest in Paris, when a number of French mathematicians hoped that they
were the right general setting for a ﬁnal assault on Fermat’s Last Theorem. The
hope was that it could be shown that Fermat’s Last Theorem for exponents n greater
than 2 did not have a solution in cyclotomic integers, and therefore no solution
in ordinary integers. Gabriel Lamé believed he had discovered such a proof and
informed the Academy of Sciences in Paris that he had done so, but it emerged that
he had assumed that the new integers obeyed all the rules that genuine integers obey.
In particular, he had assumed that a cyclotomic integer factors into prime cyclotomic
integers in an essentially unique way.
Joseph Liouville, the editor of a mathematical journal, had made it his business
to keep in touch with developments in Germany, and he advised caution, but the
ever-energetic Cayley joined in on Lamé’s side, and even claimed to have a similar
proof of his own, which Lamé may not have found very encouraging. Liouville
took the opportunity to write to Kummer, and in this way learned that Kummer had
already discovered that certain cyclotomic integers have no prime factorisations.
This destroyed the arguments of Lamé and Cayley, although Lamé kept working for
a while. Cayley merely switched to elasticity theory.
In fact, and this is the theme of Edwards’s book Fermat’s Last Theorem,
cyclotomic integers were to play a role in the subsequent history of research into
Fermat’s provocative claim. We cannot follow it here, but at about this time Sophie
Germain had divided primes into two kinds when it came to research into the
theorem, and Kummer’s cyclotomic integers turned out to ﬁt very well for what
became called the regular primes. It was in this way that the record for the value
of a prime p such that Fermat’s last theorem was known to be true for all prime
exponents q with 2 < q < p was made to creep up until it reached around 100,000.
This work is perhaps more interesting now for the inﬂuence it had on the use of
computers in mathematics (see Corry 2008) than for the mathematics itself, which
languishes today in the shade of the successful and very different resolution of
Fermat’s last theorem in Wiles (1995) and Taylor and Wiles (1995), but it was a
substantial achievement in its day.2
2Our understanding of what Germain achieved has been deepened in recent years by the papers of
Laubenbacher and Pengelley (2010), Del Centina (2008) and Del Centina and Fiocca (2012).

Chapter 17
Dedekind’s First Theory of Ideals
17.1
Introduction
This chapter picks up from the previous one and looks at how Dedekind analysed
the concept of primality in an algebraic number ﬁeld. This was to mark the start of
a sharp difference of opinion with Kronecker.
17.2
Divisibility and Primality
Algebraic number theory in the 1870s and 1880s is often viewed by historians
of mathematics as being concerned with a rather evident disagreement between
Kronecker and Dedekind about the nature of the new types of number being
introduced into the subject. Dedekind is taken as having a deepening commitment to
a truly structural point of view (see Reed (1994), Corry (1996, 2nd. ed. 2004), and
Avigad 2006) while Kronecker is regarded as the advocate of formal, algorithmic,
calculational, or explicit methods—the adjective chosen tends to indicate whether
one disapproves or approves of his approach. Edwards has repeatedly argued that
Kronecker’s theory, a revision of Kummer’s, is easier to work with (see Edwards
(1990), for example).
The issue is both computational and conceptual. Conceptually it lies at the heart
of modern structural mathematics. Not only because the terms ‘ring’ and ‘ideal’
occur here for the ﬁrst time, but because the whole idea that mathematics is about
sets with extra structures, and number theory is best done on the basis of—and
after a training in—a large amount of abstract algebra starts here. Computationally

Dedekind’s First Theory of Ideals
because even structuralists want honest answers: they disagree about how to get
them. A case in point, that belongs to the next generation (Hilbert’s) is the non-
constructive existence proof. It is asked if a such-and-such exists. The answer is
given: if it did not, there would be a logical contradiction, therefore it exists. No
effort is wasted on looking for the such-and-such, which may be very hard to ﬁnd,
but on the other hand nothing is known about it other than the bare fact that it exists.
Conceptually the argument is very attractive, but computationally it is likely to be
useless.
The issue here is what to make of Kummer’s ideal numbers. Recall that they arise
as the result of a test for divisibility, the problem being to restore unique factorisation
for a new class of (cyclotomic) integers. The test for divisibility can be carried out,
the result is either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’, but it does not exhibit the divisor if the number
is found to be divisible. Indeed, there is no account given of what the divisor is.
Conceptually we can look at this result in two ways. Either the meaning of the
adjective ‘divisible’ has been stretched, or there is a lack of an object referred to by
the noun ‘divisor’.
Kummer, although he admitted that the result was “peculiar”, decided to think of
it in the adjectival way. It worked in the setting he created it for, cyclotomic integers.
But when Kronecker and Dedekind independently came to extend these ideas
to general algebraic integers (the solutions of polynomial equations with integer
coefﬁcients and leading coefﬁcient 1) they found problems. In particular, Dedekind
agreed with Kummer that ideal numbers were necessary, but he found Kummer’s
approach unacceptable, and that for a mixture of reasons. Their multiplication was
especially difﬁcult, and he remarked1:
Because of these difﬁculties, it seems desirable to replace Kummer’s ideal numbers, which
are never deﬁned in themselves, but only as the divisors of existing numbers ω in a domain
σ, by a really existing substantive . . . .
This is, interestingly, both a computational and a conceptual objection. But it was
not just computational ease that Dedekind sought. He wanted an object to which the
noun ‘divisor’ referred. He was to go on to deﬁne an ideal number as a certain set
of complex integers. He then had to show how his newly deﬁned objects did what
was expected of them—they divided other numbers according to well-accepted rules
for the concept of division. He also had to show they were useful, and one of his
ﬁrst achievements was to show how his ideal numbers enabled one to transfer the
theory of quadratic forms to the study of complex integers. It was in this way that
the concept of an ideal was launched on its way to becoming one of the central ideas
of modern algebra.
Dedekind’s really existing numbers were deﬁned as inﬁnite sets of complex
numbers. For example, in Dedekind’s theory, all the complex numbers of the form
p +q
√
−5 which can be written in the form m·3+n

1 +
√
−5

for some ordinary
integers m and n, form an ideal number. The great example is Gauss’s introduction
1Dedekind (1877, §10).

17.2
Divisibility and Primality
197
of the Gaussian integers in 1831, which Dedekind recalled for his readers. As we
noted in Sect. 7.4, these are integers of the form m + ni where i2 = −1 and m, n
are ordinary integers, and Gauss had shown that there is a perfectly good notion of
prime Gaussian integer. He then used these new integers to solve problems in the
theory of biquadratic reciprocity. This was Dedekind’s exemplar.
Dedekind’s ﬁrst presentation of his theory of ideal numbers came out in 1871, in
Supplement X to the second edition of Dirichlet’s Zahlentheorie. By presenting his
theory of ideals as an appendix to the standard introduction to Gaussian number
theory, Dedekind hoped to reach the widest possible audience. But he became
disappointed with the result, and convinced that almost no-one had read it. He
re-wrote it for a French audience in 1876, and again for later editions of the
Zahlentheorie.
In 1882 Kummer’s former student Leopold Kronecker presented his rival version,
a divisor theory in the spirit of Kummer, in his monumental Grundzüge (Kronecker
1882).2 This theory sticks with Kummer’s emphasis on tests for divisibility and
so is ontologically parsimonious—no new nouns!—and it has always attracted a
minority of inﬂuential adherents, but even Edwards writes (1987, 19) that ‘it seems
that no-one could read [it]’.
As one might expect, the Dedekind and Kronecker approaches have a lot in
common. Both men were concerned with algebraic integers. Kronecker preferred
to work directly with the polynomial of which the algebraic integers were the
roots. Dedekind preferred to work with the ideals he had deﬁned and their abstract
properties, such as being prime or dividing another ideal. This clash of styles
continues to draw strong feelings from some number theorists, renewed in recent
years with the advent of powerful computers. Kronecker had a deep preference for
procedures that exhibited speciﬁc answers, an attitude that was probably a deeper
objection for him to Dedekind’s approach than the latter’s use of inﬁnite sets, despite
Kronecker’s steady turn towards constructivism.
A good way to think of the conceptual clarity that Dedekind valued is to follow
his own criticisms of his approach. He began in 1871 where the research frontier
was, with problems of divisibility. Whence the need to deﬁne a prime ideal, because
a good theory of division divides ‘integers’ into their ‘prime factors’. But division
is not the most basic aspect of our ordinary dealings with integers. After addition,
their most fundamental property, and possibly subtraction, comes multiplication.
Division comes after multiplication, and Dedekind came to feel that his theory
should start with a deﬁnition of how to multiply ideals, from which a division theory
would follow. Consistent with this, he deepened his objection to another aspect of
Kronecker’s theory: the way integers are written.
It happens that algebraic integers can be written as polynomials, just as it happens
that integers can be written in decimal notation. And it happens that the decimal
notation is good for certain problems (it is very good at highlighting even numbers,
and those divisible by 5, for example) just as it is no use for others. But by and
2See also Edwards (1990).

198
17
Dedekind’s First Theory of Ideals
large mathematicians are not interested in properties of numbers that are peculiar to
their decimal representation (numbers that are a string of 1s, for example). Dedekind
came to feel that algebraic number theory should not base itself on how algebraic
numbers are written—and that is an attitude antithetical to Kronecker’s explicitly
computational approach.
17.3
Rings, Ideals, and Algebraic Integers
Opinions differ about what to make of Z. Is it the great example of a group, because
it is closed under addition and one can subtract, or is it the great example of a ring,
because it is also closed under multiplication? In this book it is helpful to see it as an
example of a commutative ring with a unity, in which it makes sense to talk of prime
elements and irreducible elements, and in this case those two concepts coincide.
In the nineteenth century there was no general concept of a ring. One of the
topics in this book is, indeed, how that general concept emerged and was taken to be
important. But it will be helpful to deﬁne a ring here. A ring is a set of elements with
two binary operations, addition and multiplication, such that it is an abelian group
under addition, and multiplication satisﬁes the associative law—that is, a · (b · c) =
(a · b) · c—and the distributive law—that is, a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c.
If, moreover, multiplication is commutative the ring is said to be commutative.
From now on unless otherwise stated the term ‘ring’ will be taken to mean a
commutative ring. If there is an element 1 such that for every element r of the
ring r · 1 = 1 · r = r the ring is said to have a multiplicative unit (sometimes called
a unity). Even here the literature is not uniform, and most people these days insist
that a ring has a multiplicative unit.
Two substantial motivational examples now stretch before us. On one side are
the polynomial rings. Starting from Z or Q (or any commutative ring or ﬁeld)
one adjoins unknowns and obtains, by the operations of addition, subtraction, and
multiplication, polynomials in those unknowns. For example, x3y + y3x −3xyz is
a polynomial in three variables, and an element of the polynomial rings Z[x, y, z]
and Q[x, y, z]. The most important single fact about polynomial rings is that they
admit unique factorisation into irreducible elements. These rings interest geometers
because their elements have an obvious geometric interpretation.
On the other side are the rings of algebraic integers that interest number theorists.
An element α in the ring Z[x] is an algebraic integer if it satisﬁes a monic
polynomial with coefﬁcients in that ring. In other words, for some integers aj, j =
1, . . . , n we have
αn + a1αn−1 + . . . + an−1α + an = 0.

17.3
Rings, Ideals, and Algebraic Integers
199
What makes α an algebraic integer is that the leading coefﬁcient of the
polynomial it satisﬁes is 1 (which is what it means for the polynomial to be monic).
Elements that satisfy non-monic polynomials
a0αn + a1αn−1 + . . . + an−1α + an = 0
are called algebraic numbers. The analogy is with ordinary integers and rational
numbers. When the need arises to distinguish an ordinary integer from an algebraic
integer an ordinary integer (a member, that is, of Z) will be called a rational integer.
Many numbers are obviously algebraic integers. For example
√
2, which satisﬁes
the equation x2−2 = 0. It’s not quite so obvious that sums and products of algebraic
integers are algebraic integers. For example,
√
3 +
√
5 +
√
7 is surely an algebraic
integer, but ﬁnding the polynomial of degree 8 that is satisﬁes is time-consuming,
and the search for the appropriate monic polynomial for something like
3√
3 +
8√
5 +
5√
7 +
10√
1221 would surely only be undertaken if the answer was expected to be
unusually interesting.
We shall see Dedekind’s proof that sums and products of algebraic integers are
algebraic integers later. You will ﬁnd it easier to follow if you do the next two
exercises.

On the other hand, it was a matter of some pride in the nineteenth century to
exhibit any real numbers that were provably not algebraic integers (they are called
transcendental numbers). The ﬁrst to do so was Liouville, who showed in 1844 that
the number
∞

n=1

200
17
Dedekind’s First Theory of Ideals
is not algebraic. Even this is not obvious and involves knowing about the continued
fraction expansion of algebraic integers. It is much harder to establish that any
well-known number is transcendental. Hermite started the story by proving that e is
transcendental in 1873, and he was followed almost 10 years later by Lindemann,
who proved in 1882 that π is transcendental, thus ﬁnally proving that we cannot
square the circle by straight edge and circle.
Ring theory and group theory differ in many ways and agree in many ways. An
important distinction that arises early in the theory is this. In group theory subgroups
of a group are interesting and normal subgroups are very interesting. In ring theory
the place of a normal subgroup is taken by an ideal. An ideal A in a ring R is a
subset closed under addition and subtraction and under multiplication by arbitrary
elements of the ring (a ∈A, r ∈R ⇒ar ∈A). Interest in ring theory attaches
much more to the study of ideals than subrings.
Notice also that if we insist that a ring has a multiplicative unit then the set of
even integers 2Z is not a ring! It is therefore not a subring of the ring of integers.
But it is an ideal, and that saves the day.
17.4
Dedekind’s Theory in 1871
In his ﬁrst presentation Dedekind was concerned to show how his ideas improved
Gauss’s difﬁcult theory of quadratic forms. His treatment of that part of the theory
was clumsy and computational, and will not be discussed, but he followed it with
the ﬁrst general presentation of his theory of ideals, and that is worth considering.
He deﬁned algebraic number and algebraic integer in the usual way and then
gave a proof that the sum, difference, and product of two algebraic integers is again
an algebraic integer. He supposed that α and β are algebraic integers deﬁned by
polynomial equations of degrees a and b respectively. Consider the set of all ωij =
αiβj, 0 ≤i ≤a −1, 0 ≤j ≤b −1. Let ω be respectively the sum, difference,
and product of α and β. Then each of the ab products ωωij can be written as a sum
 rij ωij with coefﬁcients rij that are rational integers. Eliminating the ωij from
these equations yields a monic equation of degree ab for ω, as required.
Dedekind went on to show that the roots of a polynomial with coefﬁcients that
are algebraic integers are again algebraic integers (with a proof that reads like
showing that an algebraic extension of an algebraic extension is ﬁnite and therefore
algebraic), and conversely that an irreducible equation satisﬁed by an algebraic
integer in a ﬁeld of algebraic numbers has coefﬁcients that are algebraic integers.
He then showed that any algebraic number can be multiplied by a rational integer
so that the product is an algebraic integer, and all these rational integers are multiples
of the least such. He deﬁned a unit as an integer that divides every other integer, said
that two integers are essentially distinct if one is not a multiple of the other by a unit,
and deﬁned divisible (α divides β if there is an integer γ such that β = αγ ).
When Dedekind came to the concept of prime he observed that the concept would
make no sense if it was interpreted as meaning divisible only by itself and units,

17.4
Dedekind’s Theory in 1871
201
because the algebraic integer α is divisible by the algebraic integers α1/n for all n.
But the concept of relatively prime could be made to work: two algebraic integers
α and β are relatively prime if every number that is divisible by α and β is divisible
by αβ.
With these deﬁnitions in place, Dedekind turned to build up his general theory.
He called a module a system (i.e., in later language a set) a of numbers closed under
addition and subtraction. (It is indeed a Z module in modern terminology.) He said
that if the difference of two numbers belonged to a then they were congruent modulo
a, written ω ≡ω′(mod a).
He then said that if all the members of a module a are members of a module
b then a is a multiple of b and that b divides a. To remember this, note that 6 is
a multiple of 3 and the set of multiples of 6 is a subset of the multiples of 3. The
set of elements common to a and b he called the least common multiple of the two
modules. He called the set of all sums of the form α + β, where α is in a and β is in
b, the greatest common divisor of a and b.
He then introduced the concept of an ideal in a number ﬁeld. This is a set of
algebraic numbers in a given number ﬁeld that is closed under addition, subtraction,
and multiplication by the algebraic integers in the number ﬁeld. Some of these ideals
are generated by a single element; he called these principal ideals. He did not say at
this point, but it is true that every ideal in the ring of rational integers is principal,
but this is not true in general. The algebra of modules extends to ideals.
The crucial deﬁnition is that of a prime ideal in the collection A of algebraic
integers in a given number ﬁeld.3 A prime ideal is an ideal divisible only by itself
and A. He promptly showed that if the least common multiple of a collection of
ideals is divisible by a prime ideal then so is at least one of those ideals. After a
few pages he ﬁnally deduced that every ideal is the least common multiple of all the
powers of the prime ideals that divide it. Therefore an ideal a is divisible by an ideal
b if and only all the powers of the prime ideals that divide the ideal b also divide
the ideal a. Two ideals are relatively prime when their greatest common divisor is
A. Finally he showed that if a and b are two ideals then there is always an ideal m
relatively prime to b such that the product am is a principal ideal.
3I have replaced Dedekind’s symbol O with A throughout for ease of use.

Chapter 18
Dedekind’s Later Theory of Ideals
18.1
Introduction
Here we look at how Dedekind reﬁned his own theory of ideals in the later 1870s,
and then at the contrast with Kronecker.
The crucial advance was to deﬁne both ideals and operations on ideals that mimic
properties of ordinary arithmetic. Let a and b be two ideals in a commutative ring R
with a unit. In particular, the sum of a and b, written a + b, is {a + b, a ∈a, b ∈b},
and the product of a and b, written ab, is {
j ajbj, aj ∈a, bj ∈b} (the sums are
ﬁnite sums of any length). It’s a good idea to check that these sets are indeed ideals
of R.
18.2
The Multiplicative Theory
In 1877 Dedekind had a second go at deﬁning ideals and doing number theory with
them. With an eye on Gauss’s theory of quadratic forms he began with an account
of Gaussian integers. A unit is deﬁned as a number that divides every number, and
there are four units, 1, i, −1 and −i. A prime Gaussian integer p is one with the
property that if p divides a product mn then p divides either m or n. The prime
Gaussian integers are the ordinary (rational) primes of the form 4n + 3, the number
1 + i, which divides the rational prime 2 (which is therefore no longer prime in
this ring), and the numbers m ± ni that divide rational primes of the form 4n + 1.
Dedekind observed that this theory immediately gave the result that rational primes
of the form 4n + 1 are sums of two squares, a result ﬁrst discovered by Fermat.

as one does with the rational integers.

Dedekind then went on to consider analogous domains. For example, the ﬁve
domains {m + nθ : m, n ∈Z}, where θ satisﬁes one of these equations
θ2 + θ + 1 = 0 , θ2 + θ + 2 = 0 , θ2 + 2 = 0 , θ2 −2 = 0 , θ2 −3 = 0,
allow one to determine a greatest common divisor of two numbers, and so have a
familiar theory of divisibility. But the same is not true of numbers in the domain
O = {m + nθ , m, n ∈Z, θ2 = −5}.
Here, he said, one needs Kummer’s theory of ideal numbers.
Certainly, said Dedekind, one can add, subtract, multiply and sometimes even
divide such integers. One can deﬁne the norm of m + nθ to be m2 + 5n2, and the
norm of a product will be the product of the norms of the factors. One can deﬁne a
number to be decomposable if it is the product of two factors neither of which is a

unit. But factorisation ceases to be unique. Dedekind invited his readers to consider
these 15 numbers:
a = 2, b = 3, c = 7,
b1 = −2 + θ, b2 = −2 −θ, c1 = 2 + 3θ, c2 = 2 −3θ, d1 = 1 + θ, d2 = 1 −θ,
e1 = 3 + θ, e2 = 3 −θ, f1 = −1 + 2θ, f2 = −1 −2θ, g1 = 4 + θ, g2 = 4 −θ.
These numbers are all indecomposable, as is seen by looking at their norms, but
they admit products that pair up:
ab = d1d2, b2 = b1b2, ab1 = d2
1, . . . , ag1 = d1e2.
Dedekind gave ten such equations, showing that a number can be factorised in
two or three different ways. However, if one pretends that
a = α2, b = β1β2, c = γ1γ2,
then all the other twelve numbers factorise in terms of α, β1, β2, γ1 and γ2 as
if unique factorisation were present. Dedekind therefore set himself the task of
explaining how this could be and unique factorisation genuinely restored, allowing,
of course, for the presence of units.
First he showed that the number 2 behaved in the domain A as if it was square
of a prime number α, in that it could only be factored as a square. To do this, he
considered the congruence
ω2 ≡N(ω)(mod 2).
Certainly there is no such number in A, but one may follow Kummer, said Dedekind,
and introduce an ideal number with this property; call it α. It will be the case that
ω = m + nθ ∈O is divisible by α if and only if N(ω) is even, in which case
m ≡n (mod 2). Contrariwise, ω is not divisible by α whenever N(ω) is odd. By
looking at the norms Dedekind in this way built up a speciﬁcation of the properties
of an ideal factor whose square was 2. This did not, of course, say that there was
such an ideal number.
A similar argument produced speciﬁcations for the ideal factors of b = 3 and
c = 7. In fact, said Dedekind, one ﬁnds that;
1. rational primes congruent mod 20 to one of 11, 13, 17, 19, remain prime in A;
2. θ behaves like a prime number, and 2 like the square of an ideal prime number;
3. rational primes congruent mod 20 to one of 1 or 9, split in A into a product of
two distinct prime factors (not ideal ones);
4. rational primes congruent mod 20 to one of 3 or 7, split in A into a product of
two distinct ideal prime factors;

206
18
Dedekind’s Later Theory of Ideals
5. the factorisation of every number other than 0 and ±1 is either one of the primes
just listed or, for the purposes of divisibility, behaves like a product of such real
or ideal primes.
The question then, said Dedekind, was to meet all these speciﬁcations. One
could, he said, do what he believed Kronecker advocated, and enlarge the domain
A by adjoining, in the manner of Galois, β1 =
√
−2 + θ and β2 =
√
−2 −θ. The
new domain O′ = {m + nθ + m1β1 + m2β2} contains A and all the factorisations
one might want to restore unique factorisation. However, he said, this method was
not as simple as one might like because the new domain was more complicated than
A and moreover was somewhat arbitrary.
Dedekind therefore suggested regarding the ideal number α as the inﬁnite set
generated by 2 and 1 + θ, denoted {2, 1 + θ}. Similarly, he deﬁned these ideal
numbers:
b1 = {3, 1 + θ}, b2 = {3, 1 −θ}, c1 = {7, 3 + θ}, c2 = {7, 3 −θ}.
These sets are what he again called ideals: they are closed under addition and
subtraction, and under multiplication by elements of A.
Next Dedekind deﬁned products and quotients of ideals. The product of two
ideals a and b he deﬁned as consisting of arbitrary sums of products of the form
ab, a ∈a, b ∈b. So the generator of the product of two principal ideals is the
product of the generators of the individual ideals. One ideal, a, divides another, b
if every member of b is a member of a. In particular, one principal ideal divides
another when the generator of the ﬁrst divides the generator of the second.
Now he could show that with his deﬁnition of ideal factors, the 15 numbers he
introduced could be written in terms of the ideals they correspond to or factor into,
and unique factorisation was apparently preserved. Then it only remained to show
that the concept of a prime ideal could be deﬁned and the factors proved to be prime
factors. Dedekind repeated his earlier deﬁnition: an ideal other than A is prime if its
only factors are itself and A. It is then clear, indeed from the earlier consideration
of norms, that the ideal factors are, after all, prime ideals, and unique factorisation
has been restored to the ring A.
18.3
Dedekind and ‘Modern Mathematics’
Dedekind revised his theory four times over the course of his working life, and
each time he set more and more value by the generality and uniformity of his
theory. He developed it to apply to all sorts of rings of algebraic integers, and
relied on the fact that the introduction of prime ideals allowed him to establish a

18.3
Dedekind and ‘Modern Mathematics’
207
prime factorisation theorem for ideals.1 This is when the concepts of an ‘integer’
being ‘prime’ and ‘irreducible’ diverged, and it is interesting to see that when this
happened the stronger and more traditional word went with the deeper structural
property.
Avigad and Corry have emphasised how ﬁrmly Dedekind’s successive revisions
of his theory make it clear he identiﬁed with a structuralist approach.2 His dislike of
relying on choices of elements not only denied algorithmic considerations a funda-
mental role, it drove his critique of the concepts he himself employed. As we have
just seen, he re-wrote his theory to accord with the logical priority of multiplication
over division, but this moved his work further away from the original problems.
I have argued in Plato’s Ghost that Dedekind’s approach is recognisably
modernist. It expresses a need for internal deﬁnitions of objects that are tailored
to meet internally set goals of the theory. The concepts of integer and prime are
stretched; and indeed Dedekind’s very deﬁnition of an integer is both novel and
set-theoretic. He ﬁrst deﬁned the set of natural numbers, and then deﬁned a natural
number as a member of this set. Here, as with his deﬁnition of the real numbers,
Dedekind’s key tool was his conﬁdence in the use of inﬁnite sets of more familiar
objects. Like his famous cuts in the theory of real numbers, his ideals in algebraic
number theory are inﬁnite sets of more basic elements.
That said, Corry made a very useful distinction between Dedekind’s modernist
tendencies and those of later, more structuralist, mathematicians when he wrote
(1996, 131): ‘Dedekind’s modules and ideals are not “algebraic structures” similar
to yet another “structure”: ﬁelds. They are not “almost-ﬁelds” failing to satisfy
one of the postulates that deﬁne the latter.’ Rather, numbers remained the focus of
Dedekind’s enquiries, and modules and ideals were only tools. For all his abstract
conceptual way of thinking, he was a long way from the groups, rings, and ﬁelds
formulation of modern algebra that is due almost entirely to Emmy Noether and her
school, and which will be discussed in Chap. 28.
The subsequent reception of the approaches of Dedekind and Kronecker cannot
be explained by their contrasting professional situations. Precisely because Kro-
necker was well established in Berlin, and although he attracted only a few students
they were generally very good, whereas Dedekind was in self-imposed isolation
in Braunschweig, one might have expected Kronecker’s methods to carry the day.
Both men in different ways tied themselves to the tradition established by Gauss
and Dirichlet. But Dedekind was a lucid writer, and Kronecker a difﬁcult one.
Dedekind’s friend Heinrich Weber also wrote his inﬂuential three-volume textbook
of algebra largely in Dedekind’s manner, and Hilbert learned number theory from
Weber. Hilbert’s account of the subject in his hugely inﬂuential Zahlbericht (Hilbert
1897) set the terms of research for over 50 years, and since Hilbert preferred
Dedekind’s ideals to Kronecker’s divisors, their survival was assured.

Dedekind’s Later Theory of Ideals
Both Kronecker’s and Dedekind’s approaches carried great weight as examples
of how existence questions in mathematics could be treated. They arose from
genuine research questions in a high point of contemporary German mathematics,
the algebraic theory of numbers, and so mathematicians could not dismiss them
as mere philosophy. When Hilbert made Dedekind’s approach the mainstream one
it not only represented a victory for naïve set theory, he may also, as Goldstein,
Schappacher, and Schwermer have pointed out, diverted attention from the number
theory involved with elliptic and modular functions that was preferred by Kronecker
(and Hermite in France). It was in this spirit that van der Waerden wrote: “It was
Evariste Galois and Richard Dedekind who gave modern algebra its structure; that
is where its weight-bearing skeleton comes from.”3

Chapter 19
Quadratic Forms and Ideals
19.1
Introduction
One of the successes of Dedekind’s theory was the way it allowed Gauss’s very
complicated theory of the composition of quadratic forms to be re-written much
more simply in terms of modules and ideals in a quadratic number ﬁeld, which in
turn explained the connection between forms and algebraic numbers. Here we look
at how this was done.
19.2
Dedekind’s 11th Supplement, 1871–1894
As we have said already, Dedekind produced four editions of Dirichlet’s Lectures.
Here we have space only to look at his treatment of composition of forms.
This topic is not discussed at all in the ﬁrst edition. In the second edition (1871)
the new tenth Supplement, entitled ‘On the composition of binary quadratic forms’,
begins by explaining how forms are composed and how genera are composed,
then introduces the concepts of algebraic integers, modules, and ideals in a ring
(as we would say, but not Dedekind) of algebraic integers. The Supplement closes
with an account of modules in quadratic ﬁelds and the composition of quadratic
forms.
Dedekind was unhappy with the poor reception this Supplement received, and
produced an improved account in a paper in French (Dedekind 1877) and then
rewrote the material for the third edition of the Lectures. The account of composition
of forms in the second edition was considerably rewritten, and although we do not
know why, it may well have been because the closing sections that compare the
Gaussian approach with one involving modules come across as an unilluminating
exercise in elementary algebra. The effect is to show that one could do it either

Quadratic Forms and Ideals
way, and either way there is a lot of work to check that everything proceeds
correctly. What may have been intended as a conceptual rewrite looks more like
book keeping.
The third edition (1879) is dedicated to Dedekind’s friend Heinrich Weber. In the
foreword to this edition Dedekind says that his earlier presentation of the theory of
ideals “was presented in such a condensed form that the wish for a more detailed
exposition was expressed to me from many directions”. This, he said, he was now
happy to provide, and to thank Weber for his help with this and the (1877) account.
The (1871) account of 110 pages had now grown to a revised Supplement X on the
composition of forms of 49 pages and a Supplement XI on algebraic integers of 178
pages.
The fourth and ﬁnal edition (1894) keeps this division, but Supplement XI
now grew to 224 pages. Most of the enlarged and improved material has to do
with the general theory of algebraic numbers. The changes to the material we
are focussing on here are mostly cosmetic: some ideas are introduced in earlier
sections rather than being introduced when needed. The signiﬁcant improvement
over the second edition is clear in both the third and fourth editions: there is a step
by step account of modules in a quadratic ﬁeld, how they correspond to binary
quadratic forms, how they can be multiplied, and how this corresponds to the
composition of the corresponding forms in terms of the norms of the modules.
The conceptual structure stands out, the necessary elementary algebra is clearly
motivated.1
Dedekind’s huge 11th supplement to Dirichlet’s Lectures, (1894), entitled Über
die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen (‘On the theory of algebraic numbers’),
presents the theory in considerable generality. Dedekind gave an account of ﬁnite-
dimensional extensions of the rational ﬁeld, which we looked at in Sect. 17.3 above
and will look at again in Sect. 23.3 below. He then deﬁned integers in such ﬁelds,
explained the theory of modules and ideals (prime ideals, norm of an ideal) and
ideal classes. At the end he turned to quadratic ﬁelds, and that is the only case I shall
consider here. This is not too perverse a selection because, as Dedekind himself said
“It stands in the closest connection with the theory of binary quadratic forms, which
is the principal object of this work”. A translation of this part of the supplement will
be found in Appendix F.
The supplement has an ambition that matches its scope. It opens with the
remark that the concept of the integer has been greatly extended in the nineteenth
century, starting with Gauss’s introduction in 1831 of the Gaussian integers (not
Dedekind’s term). Dedekind carefully reviewed their theory, established the concept
of a norm of a Gaussian integer, deﬁned primes in this setting and proved the unique
factorisation theorem for them. He repeated the proof that rational integers of the
form 4n + 1 cease to be prime as Gaussian integers, but those of the form 4n + 3
1I have decided to concentrate on the fourth edition (1879) rather than the third (1879) because the
fourth edition was reprinted in Dedekind’s Mathematische Werke.

211
remain prime. This led on to a discussion of integers of the form m + nθ, where m
and n are rational integers and θ2 + 5 = 0.
All of this was preparatory to the theme of the supplement, which was to pick
up from Kummer’s introduction of the cyclotomic integers and in particular the idea
of cyclotomic integers and to provide a general theory of algebraic integers of any
kind.
As part of that theory, Dedekind described (in §168) what he called a module: a
system of numbers (a subset of a ﬁeld) closed under addition and subtraction, and
therefore under multiplication by the rational integers Z. In short, what we would
today call a Z module. It is what (in §177) he called an ideal if it is closed under
multiplication by the algebraic integers in the ﬁeld. The norm of an ideal a in a ring
of algebraic integers A is the number of elements in A/a – thus the norm of the
prime ideal (p) in Z is the number of elements in Z/pZ, which is p.
To study quadratic ﬁelds, starting in §186, Dedekind introduced the ‘system’,
Ω = Q(
√
d), where d is a square-free integer. This is a ﬁeld with discriminant D,
where D = d if d ≡1 mod 4 and D = 4d if d ≡2, 3 mod 4. The algebraic
integers in these ﬁelds are:
1. when d ≡1 mod 4: of the form 1
2(m + n
√
d), m, n ∈Z and both of the same
parity (both odd or both even);
2. when d ≡2, 3 mod 4: of the form (m + n
√
d), m, n ∈Z.
The algebraic integers form a module, and Dedekind observed that if we deﬁne
Θ = D+
√
D
2
, then A = Z[Θ], which he wrote as [1, Θ].
Dedekind was interested in the factorisation of ideals in A, in particular when
does an ideal prime in Z cease to be prime as an ideal in A? Note that it becomes
the ideal A(p) consisting of all the elements in A that are multiples of p. First we
do a little calculation. If p factorises in A then it must factorise as
p = (a + b
√
d)(a −b
√
d) = a2 −b2d.
Modulo p this says that
a2 ≡b2d mod p,
so d must be a square mod p. When it is, say
c2 ≡d mod p,
with −1
2(p −1) ≤c ≤1
2(p −1) and consider
(c +
√
d)(c −
√
d) = c2 −d.
This will be a multiple of p, in fact ±p. This suggests looking at these ideals [p, c+
√
d] and [p, c −
√
d] as potential factors of A(p).

212
19
Quadratic Forms and Ideals
Dedekind introduced the notion of a conjugate of an ideal. The conjugate of an
ideal a has, as its elements, the conjugates of the elements of a. An ideal may or
may not equal its conjugate.
Here is what he found: an ideal p is prime if its norm divides p2, where p is
a rational prime. Assume p ̸= 2. Then there are three cases (in what follows, p′
denotes the conjugate ideal of p):
1. N(p) = p : in this case Ap = pp′, p ̸= p′and D is a square mod 4p;
2. N(p) = p2: in this case Ap = p, and D is not a square mod 4p;
3. p divides D, in which case Ap = p2.
In the ﬁrst case the rational prime p factors into two distinct prime ideals in A,
in the second case it remains prime, and in the third case it factors as a square of a
prime ideal.
Next, he dealt with the rational prime 2. He found that:
1. if 2 does not divide D, and d ≡1 mod 8 then A2 = pp′, p ̸= p′;
2. if 2 does not divide D, and d ≡5 mod 8 then A2 = p;
3. if 2 divides D then A2 = p2.
Next, Dedekind gave a formula for the number of ideal classes. Presently I omit
this.
Dedekind concluded his very long paper with a leisurely account of how his
theory re-writes the classical theory of binary quadratic forms. For this he worked
with modules in a quadratic ﬁeld Ω. The module [α, β], where α and β are two
algebraic numbers (not necessarily integers), is all algebraic numbers of the form
xα + yβ, where x, y ∈Z. Simple algebra shows that there is always an algebraic
integer ω and a rational number m, not necessarily an integer, such that [α, β] =
m[1, ω]. This ω satisﬁes an equation
aω2 −bω + c = 0, where a, b, c ∈Z, a > 0.
The sign of b is chosen for convenience, and the greatest common divisor of a, b, c
is 1. This implies that there are rational integers h and k such that
aω = h + kθ, and d = b2 −4ac = Dk2.
He had earlier drawn attention to the situation where all the elements of a module
m are contained in another module n. In this case he said that m was divisible by n,
or n goes into m. But then he wrote this as
m > n or n < m.
So we must be careful: his > is our ⊆, his < our ⊇!
He now associated to a module m the set of all algebraic numbers ν such that
νm is divisible by m. It is a module, which he denoted mo. In particular he was
interested in n, the set of all ν such that [ν, νω] is divisible by [1, ω]. After some

19.3
An Example of Equivalent Ideals
213
algebra he deduced that
n = [1, aω] = [1, kθ] = Ak + [1],
where A = o is the ring of quadratic integers and a is the integer we met before.
Now, an algebraic number μ is in m if there are rational integers x and y and a
rational number (not necessarily an integer) m such that
μ = m(x + yω).
Take the norms and we get
N(μ) = μ ¯μ = m2(x + yω)(x + y ¯ω).
This multiplies out to give
N(μ) = N(m)(ax2 + bxy + cy2).
This shows that to the module m there corresponds the quadratic form (a, 1
2b, c).
The correspondenceproceeds via a number of choices to get the basis for the module
m, and so other quadratic forms can be obtained, but although they differ from this
one they are equivalent to it.
Now, modules can be multiplied. Dedekind showed that the product of a module
and its conjugate is moN(m). Then, after a long calculation, he showed that:
given two modules and the quadratic forms they correspond to, the product of
elements from the modules corresponds to the quadratic form obtained by Gaussian
composition of the two associated quadratic forms. Dedekind concluded his paper
by indicating how one can deﬁne equivalence relations among modules and so
study the orders and genera that make up the class group. This was to be widely
accepted as the way, henceforth, that Gauss’s theory of composition of forms should
be treated.
19.3
An Example of Equivalent Ideals
It is true that every ideal in the ring of integers Z[Θ] has a basis of the form [a, b +
gΘ] where a and b are rational integers
0 ≤b < a, 0 < a, and a|b2 −g2Θ2.
Moreover, such a basis is unique. I shall assume these results without proof.
We say that two such ideals J1 and J2 are equivalent if there are integers α1 and
α2 in Q[Θ]—not necessarily rational integers—such that
J1α1 = J2α2.

214
19
Quadratic Forms and Ideals
In words, two ideals are equivalent if they become equal on multiplication by
principal ideals.
Notice that if we are interested in ideals that are equivalent to [a, b + gΘ] we
have
[a, b + gΘ] = g[(a/g), (b/g) + Θ],
where a/g and b/g are integers, so the ideals [a, b + gΘ] and [(a/g), (b/g) + Θ]
are equivalent. Therefore we can assume that it is enough to work with ideals of the
form [a, b + Θ] with g = 1.
For simplicity, I now work in the cases where D ≡2, 3 mod 4, and write Θ =
θ = √−d. You should write out the corresponding results in the case d ≡1 mod 4.
Exercises
1. Calculate [a, b + θ](b −θ) and deduce that the ideal [a, b + θ] and the ideal
[c, −b + θ] are equivalent (note that θ2 = b2 −ac).
2. Calculate [a, b + θ](a −b + θ) and deduce that the ideal [a, b + θ] and the ideal
[a −2b + c, b −c + θ] are equivalent.
3. Show that the ideals [3, 2 + θ] and [7, 3 + θ] are equivalent.
To the ideal [a, b + θ] we associate the quadratic form
(ax + (b + θ)y)(ax2 + (b −θ)y)
a
= ax2 + 2bxy + (b2 −θ2)y2.
If we can take θ =
√
−d, the quadratic form is
ax2 + 2bxy + b2 −θ2
a
y2 = ax2 + 2bxy + (b2 + d)y2 = ax2 + 2bxy + cy2,
where θ2 = b2 −ac.
You should now check that the equivalences just established correspond to the
transformation s of quadratic forms S2 and S1 respectively that were deﬁned in
Sect. 3.2. This gives us a quick way of identifying the equivalence class of an ideal.
Some ad hoc notation may help. I shall write the ideal [a, b + θ] as [a, b; c],
where c = b2+d
a
. Then we have the equivalences
[a, b; c] ∼[c, −b; a],
[a, b; c] ∼[a −2b + c, b −c; c],
[a, b; c] ∼[a + 2b + c, b + c, a],
which we can call s2, s1, and s−1
1
respectively.
If we can now show that if two ideals are equivalent then so are the corresponding
quadratic forms, and vice versa, then it remains to check that composition of forms
corresponds to multiplication of ideals, and a weight is lifted from the theory of

19.3
An Example of Equivalent Ideals
215
binary quadratic forms. In fact, those claims are valid, but it takes just a little too
long to prove them here. And you may recall that we did not prove the reduction
theorem for quadratic forms in Chap. 3. For this, you may read the Dedekind extract
in Appendix F, where, however, he worked with modules.
In the case we keep returning to, where d = −5, we ﬁnd that there are two
equivalence classes of ideals. In one class go the principal ideal and all the ideals
equivalent to them, and in the other the ideals equivalent to [2, 1 −θ]. In this case, a
ﬁrst step in ﬁnding ideals equivalent to [a, b + θ] is to consider [a, b + θ](b −θ) =
[ab −aθ, b2 + 5] and to reduce that ideal to canonical form. For example:
[7, 3 + θ](3 −θ) = [21 −7θ, 14] = (7)[2, 3 −θ] = (7)[2, 1 + θ],
which is as far as that reduction can be taken.

Kronecker’s Algebraic Number Theory
20.1
Introduction
Here we look at the Kroneckerian alternative to Dedekind’s approach to ‘ring
theory’ set out in his Grundzüge and later extended by the Hungarian mathematician
Gyula (Julius) König. This leads us to the emergence of the concept of an abstract
ﬁeld.
20.2
Kronecker’s Vision of Mathematics
Kronecker is one of those mathematicians who seldom wrote anything simple, and
usually addressed only important questions in the ﬁelds he cared about (elliptic
functions, number theory, and algebra). Through Dirichlet he was introduced to
the circle around the banker Alexander Mendelssohn, where he came to know the
composer Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Alexander von Humboldt (Wilhelm
von Humboldt, who founded Berlin University in 1810, was Alexander’s older
brother).
In later life Kronecker inclined more and more to a philosophy of mathematics
that few shared. This contributed to a painful split in the Mathematics Department
at Berlin where, with Kummer and Weierstrass, he was one of the three most senior
professors until 1890, when Kummer retired; Kronecker died in 1891. He advocated
speaking of mathematical objects only when a construction had been given for them,
which could include ﬁnite formal expressions, and this is often encapsulated in his

Kronecker’s Algebraic Number Theory
dictum that “The good Lord made the natural numbers, every thing else is the work
of man”.1
Kronecker’s Grundzüge has a justiﬁed reputation for difﬁculty. Even a work like
Edwards (1990), closely as it sticks to the spirit of Kronecker’s endeavour, does
not set out to do justice to the size and scope of that enterprise. The problem is
compounded by Kronecker’s notoriously difﬁcult style; it is easy to get lost in the
march of detail. Edwards comments (Edwards, 1990, p. 355) that
Kronecker’s theory . . . did not win wide acceptance. The presentation is difﬁcult to follow,
and the development leaves gaps that even a reader as knowledgeable as Dedekind found
hard to ﬁll.
Even Hermann Weyl, who in this matter is a supporter of Kronecker’s, had to admit
that “Kronecker’s approach ...has recently been completely neglected” (Weyl 1940,
p. iii). Finally, there is the conscious philosophy that comes with the school and
cannot fairly be cut from it. The paradigm for all who worked in this tradition is not
algebra but arithmetic, and it will be worth attending carefully to what they meant
by that. There is real excitement for the historian here, and we can get a sense of it
by attending to the sheer ambition of his project, and why it held arithmetic in such
high regard.2
It might be best to try and set aside what one thinks one knows about Kronecker’s
philosophy of mathematics. This is usually expressed in negative terms: his
factorisation theory eschewed Dedekind-style naive set theory and could therefore
happily announce that some number was divisible without having an object that
represented its divisors (Dedekind was appalled by this); Kronecker was a strict
ﬁnitist with no place for transcendental numbers, even, on some views, algebraic
numbers. Thus Klein said of Kronecker that3:
he worked principally with arithmetic and algebra, which he raised in later years to a deﬁnite
intellectual norm for all mathematical work. With Kronecker, who for philosophical reasons
recognised the existence of only the integers or at most the rational numbers, and wished to
banish the irrational numbers entirely, a new direction in mathematics arose that found the
foundations of Weierstrassian function theory unsatisfactory.
He then alluded brieﬂy to what has become one of the best-known feuds in
mathematics, the last years of Kronecker and Weierstrass at Berlin, offered his own
wisdom as an old man on these matters, and observed that although Kronecker’s phi-
losophy has always attracted adherents it never did displace the Weierstrassian point
of view. Finally he quoted with approval Poincaré’s judgement that Kronecker’s
greatest inﬂuence lies in number theory and algebra but his philosophical teaching
have temporarily been forgotten.
The matter is, as so often, better put positively. The ﬁrst thing is the enormous
range of the project. This was emphasised by his former student Eugen Netto when
he surveyed Kronecker’s work for an American audience, on the occasion of the

Kronecker’s Vision of Mathematics

World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, 2 years after Kronecker’s death
(Netto 1896). Netto quoted Kronecker as having said that he had thought more in his
life about philosophy than mathematics, and that the expression of his philosophical
views was to be found in his ideas about arithmetic.
So far as possible, Kronecker wanted a common method for dealing with all the
problems of mathematics that come down to properties of polynomials in any ﬁnite
number of variables over some ﬁeld, usually the rational numbers. In the strict sense
in which Kronecker intended to be understood, the ground ﬁeld is at most an alge-
braic extension of a pure transcendental extension of ﬁnite transcendence degree of
the rationals. We shall see that there were those, like Molk, who accepted this start-
ing point, and others, like König, who preferred to start with the complex numbers.
So Kronecker’s subject matter included all of algebraic number theory, and,
when interpreted geometrically, the theory of algebraic curves and, insofar as it
existed, the theory of algebraic varieties of any dimension. This is why he occupies
what might otherwise seem an unexpected place in the history of early modern
algebraic geometry. The fact that the ground ﬁeld is not the complex numbers,
nor even algebraically closed, need not be an insuperable problem: a great deal of
algebraic geometry can still be done by passing, if need be, to successive algebraic
extensions. What Kronecker could not do, according to his lights, is pass to the
full algebraic closure of the rational ﬁeld. While this would not necessarily be a
signiﬁcant mathematical problem for any one drawn to this approach, the historian
cannot escape so easily, however, as we shall see when we discuss the limited
references Kronecker actually made to geometry.
The analogy between algebra and arithmetic, which will be discussed a little
below, is a real one, and by reﬁning the question they share of ﬁnding common
factors Kronecker sought to exploit to the beneﬁt of all the various aspects. It is the
analogy with algebraic number theory that drove him to call his theory arithmetic,
rather than merely algebraic. The basic building blocks were two things: the usual
integers and the rational numbers, on the one hand, and variables on the other. These
were combined according to the usual four laws of arithmetic; root extraction was
to be avoided in favour of equations (for example, the variable x and the equation
x2 −2 = 0, rather than
√
2).
Kronecker himself set out the thinking that led him to his general programme
in a fascinating preface to a paper of 1881, Über die Discriminante algebraischer
Functionen einer variabeln (‘On the discriminants of algebraic functions of a single
variable’). The preface is a lengthy historical account indicating how much he had
already proposed in lectures at the University of Berlin (and who his audience
had included) and at a session of the Berlin Academy in 1862. The guiding aim,
which he traced back to 1857, was to treat integral algebraic numbers (for which
the modern term is algebraic integers). These he deﬁned as roots of polynomial
equations with leading term 1 and integer coefﬁcients. He encountered certain
difﬁculties, which is where the discriminants come in. The resolution of these
problems came with the insight that it was a useless, even harmful restriction to
consider the rational functions of a quantity x that satisﬁes an algebraic equation
of degree n only in the form of polynomials in x (i.e. as linear homogeneous
functions of 1, x, . . . , xn−1). It would be better, he realised, to treat them as linear

220
20
Kronecker’s Algebraic Number Theory
homogeneous forms in any n linearly independent functions of x. This made it
possible to represent complex numbers by forms, in which every algebraic integer
appeared as an integer while circumventing the difﬁculties. The insight may be put
another way: an irreducible polynomial of degree n with distinct roots deﬁned n
quantities at once, and it can be shown that it cannot share a subset of these roots
with any other irreducible polynomial. By picking on one root, problems arise that
can be avoided by treating all the roots simultaneously. (If you like, and to over-
simplify, study ±
√
2, but not just
√
2.)
He discussed these results with Weierstrass, who was his friend at the time,
and Weierstrass urged him to apply the same principles to algebraic functions of
a single variable and if possible to the study of integrals of algebraic functions,
taking account of all possible singularities. This set him on the road to a purely
algebraic treatment, shunning geometric or analytic methods. He sent the ﬁrst
fruits to Weierstrass in October 1858, but Weierstrass’s own results rendered his
superﬂuous in his own eyes and so he refrained from further publication. He was
brought back to the topic by discovering how much his thoughts coincided with
those of Dedekind and Weber (an agreement which did not, he noted, extend to the
basic deﬁnition and explanation of the concept of a divisor). Therefore he presented
his old ideas, abandoned in 1862, for publication in 1881.
Kronecker’s Grundzüge is a lengthy work, and an unrelenting one (you can
consult Edwards (1990) for a thorough mathematical commentary, where you will
learn amongst other things of the unproven claims Kronecker made). This mixture of
great claims for the rigour and immediacy of the theory and the absence of proofs at
crucial points surely contributed to the work’s poor reception. Dedekind’s rival ver-
sion, attacked by Kronecker for its abstraction, was not so embarrassed. Kronecker
does not seem to have had the knack of conveying in print what was known, what
can be done, and what might be discovered in a way that would drive future research.
Kronecker’s Grundzüge is about objects which are so common in mathematics
that it is hard to know what to call them. They are polynomials in several variables
and their quotients by other such polynomials. A collection of rational functions in
some (ﬁnite set of) indeterminates Ri closed under the four operations of arithmetic
Kronecker called a Rationalitätsbereich, which I translate as domain of rationality.
A ganz or integral function in a domain is a polynomial in the Rs. The old name of
‘rational functions’ (which Kronecker used) survives, although they are not thought
of as functions but expressions. The coefﬁcients may be integers, rational numbers,
or elements of some ‘ﬁeld’ (another term we shall have to return to). The crucial
thing about these objects is that they can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and
divided (of course, one cannot divide by zero). Kronecker also insisted that there
was no question of order here, such expressions are not greater or less than others
(which rules out use of anything like the Euclidean algorithm). He also explicitly
wished to avoid geometrical language.
Kronecker’s Grundzüge places three obstacles in the way of comprehension. One
is the number of unproven claims that are made. Another is the style, which mixes
up what is proved with unproven claims about what is true. The third is the delicate,
and often heavily computational nature of the material. Each of these difﬁculties
calls for comment. The existence of unproven claims is not necessarily a barrier to

the acceptance of a work; it may function as a challenge to later workers. However,
the failure to meet these challenges, coupled with the opportunity of switching to
a rival theory that did not have these disadvantages, was to prove crucial in the
demise of Kronecker’s approach. As for the style, unexpected though it may be
in a mathematician with a strong axe to grind about what is the right way to do
mathematics, it is typical of the period. Long papers and books were designed to be
read; they were seldom presented in the style of deﬁnition, theorem, proof that came
in later, with Landau. It is tempting to imagine that it was the obstacles presented by
such works as Kronecker’s Grundzüge that pushed Landau to accentuate the division
between mathematics and literature. It is also noticeable that Hilbert’s writings were
much more lucid and carefully structured so that they could be easily understood.
The ﬁnal obstacle would be a virtue if the computational machine gave acceptable
answers. The problem seems to have been that it did not.
Edwards’s analysis of Kronecker’s theory praises it for being based on the idea
of divisors, and in particular the idea of greatest common divisors (when they exist).
The greatest common divisor of two elements of a ﬁeld is, Edwards points out (1990,
v), independent of the ﬁeld: if two objects have a third as their greatest common
divisor this third object remains their greatest common divisor even if the ﬁeld is
extended. This is not the case for prime elements: an element may be prime in one
ﬁeld but factorise in an extension of that ﬁeld. Kronecker claimed to have a method
for factorising a given divisor as a product of prime divisors. His successor Hensel
gave a proof that this method works in the context of algebraic number ﬁelds, and
echoed Kronecker’s claim that the method worked in general. But he never gave
such a proof, and Edwards wrote in 1990 that he did not know of one.
Edwards makes light, however, of what seemed to every one at the time to be an
immediate problem with divisor theory: there simply may not be a greatest common
divisor of two elements. Rings and ﬁelds with greatest common divisors include all
the so-called ‘natural domains’; these are the domains which are either the rational
numbers or pure transcendental extensions of the rational numbers. They are to
be contrasted with algebraic number ﬁelds, which typically do not have greatest
common divisors. All writers (Kronecker, Molk, König) give the same example,
due originally to Dedekind, because it is the simplest: algebraic integers of the form
m+n
√
−5. It is easy to show that 2−
√
−5 is irreducible, but it is not prime. Indeed,
(2 −
√
−5)(2 +
√
−5) = 9 = 3 · 3, but 2 −
√
−5 does not divide 3 (the solutions, x
and y, of the equation (2 −
√
−5)(2 +
√
−5) = 3 are not integers). So the algebraic
integers 9 and 3(2−
√
−5) have no greatest common divisor: their common divisors
are 1, 3 and 2 −
√
−5, but neither of 3 and 2 −
√
−5 divides the other. It was
exactly this problem that caused Dedekind to formulate his theory of ideals, which
invokes ideals that are not principal (generated by a single element) precisely to
the get round the problem. In König’s terminology, rings and ﬁelds having greatest
common divisors are called complete, those like Q(
√
−5), are incomplete. In the
Kroneckerian approach the whole analysis grinds to a halt with incomplete domains.
Netto (1896, p. 252) observed that ﬁnding irreducible factors was an open question
once the existence of greatest common divisors failed.
Kronecker’s most powerful inﬂuence was exerted on the handful of students
around him at any time in Berlin. For that reason it is worthwhile looking at the

posthumous volume of his lectures (Kronecker 1901), edited by Hensel. This was
largely based on his lectures in the 1880s, but the lectures have the advantage over
the Grundzüge of being both more elementary, clearer about what has been proved,
and more geometric. It may be the case that the lectures were more inﬂuential
than the Grundzüge, or at least that the combination of lectures and conversa-
tion was more potent (Kronecker was a sociable mathematician, see Biermann
1973/1988).Best known among his followers are Hensel (who knew him personally,
succeeded him at Berlin, and edited this volume of Kronecker’s Vorlesungen über
Zahlentheorie in 1901) and Landsberg. Another was Netto, whose two-volume
Algebra (1896–1900) is his account of ideas in the Grundzüge. Volume 1 covers
the algebra of polynomial equations in a single variable (but no group theory),
the approximation of the roots, explicit methods for equations of degrees less than
ﬁve, and the cyclotomic equations. Volume 2 ﬁrst deals with algebraic functions
in several variables and equations in several unknowns, the theory of elimination in
various forms, and culminated in an account of Kronecker’s theory of characteristics
and Hermite’s theory of quadratic forms. Then it returns to algebraic functions
of a single variable, presents Hilbert’s irreducibility theorem, the theory of cyclic
and abelian equations, the concept of algebraic numbers, the algebraic solution of
algebraic equations, the theory of inﬂection points on cubic curves, and concludes
with a treatment of the solvable and the general quintic equations (Fig. 20.1).4

Kronecker’s Lectures
In his Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (1901, Lecture 13) Kronecker deﬁned a
domain of rationality determined by an indeterminate R as the totality of all products
and quotients of polynomials in R (division by 0 being excluded). He denoted it
(R)—we would write it as Q(R). He showed that it consisted precisely of all rational
functions of R with integer coefﬁcients. If division was not allowed, a subdomain of
(R) was constructed which he called a domain of integrity (Integritätsbereich) and
denoted [R]—we would write it as Z[R]. Kronecker observed that if in particular
the indeterminate R is set equal to 1, then (R) = (1) is the usual rational numbers,
and [R] is the integers. The same construction can also be carried out with ﬁnitely
many indeterminates.
Divisibility in any domain of integrity had the natural meaning that m divides a
if and only if there is an integer c in the domain such that a = cm. Kronecker chose
to write this in the formalism of congruences to a modulus, deliberately echoing
Gauss, and therefore spoke of modular systems (Modulsysteme in German). When
a = cm he said that a was contained in the modular system (m), and more generally
he said that a form a was contained in a modular system (m1, m2, . . . , mr) or was
divisible by the modular system if a = c1m1 + c2m2 + · · · + crmr , for some
integers c1, c2, . . . , cr. He said that two modular systems were equivalent if each
was contained in the other.
He then turned to divisors. The greatest common divisor of the modular systems
(m1, m2, . . . , mr) and (n1, n2, . . . , ns) was, he showed, the modular system
(m1, m2, . . . , mr, n1, n2, . . . , ns),
and the composition of two modular systems (m1, m2, . . . , mr) and (n1, n2, . . . , ns)
was, he also showed, the modular system (minj ; 1 ≤i ≤r, 1 ≤j ≤s). This was
later called the product of the two modular systems.
In Lecture 14, Kronecker restricted his attention to polynomials in a single
variable and integer coefﬁcients. In this domain a generalisation of the Euclidean
algorithm permitted him to ﬁnd the greatest common divisor of two polynomials,
as follows. Given f1(x) and f2(x), with f1(x) of higher degree than f2(x), one
can write f1(x) = q(x)f2(x) + r(x), where the degree of r(x) is less than that of
f2(x), but it is not certain that the coefﬁcients of q(x) and r(x) will be integers.
By following this complication through, Kronecker deduced that: If f1(x) and
f2(x) are polynomials with integer coefﬁcients, then by successive division one
can ﬁnd a polynomial fn(x) with integer coefﬁcients and two integers s1 and s2
such that fn(x) ≡0 (mod f1(x), f2(x)) and s1f1(x) ≡s2f2(x) ≡0 (mod fn(x)).
The polynomial is the greatest common divisor of f1(x) and f2(x) if and only if
s1 = s2 = 1.
Divisor or modular systems (f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) that are equivalent to a system
with just one element (f (x)) he called modular systems of the ﬁrst level or rank, all
others of the second level. An example of the ﬁrst kind was (3x −3, x2 −1, x2 +

224
20
Kronecker’s Algebraic Number Theory
x −2); of the second kind (m, x −n), where m > 1. A modular system was said to
be pure if the deﬁning terms have no non-trivial common factor, otherwise mixed.
So (3, x −1) is pure, and (3(x2 + 1), (x −1)(x2 + 1)) is mixed. To use Dedekind’s
language harmlessly here, an element of a domain of integrity belonged to a modular
system if it was in the ideal the modular system generated.
Pure divisor systems of the ﬁrst level lead to the study of polynomials with integer
coefﬁcients and their irreducible factors. In Lecture 15, Kronecker proved the unique
decomposition theorem in this context. Let the given polynomial be
F(x) = c0 + c1x + · · · + cnxn.
The Euclidean algorithm ﬁnds the greatest common divisor of the coefﬁcients, m
say. Factoring it out leads to the polynomial with integer coefﬁcients
f (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn.
The possible degrees of any factor of f (x) can be found easily from the factors of
n, but ﬁnding the coefﬁcients of any factor would be harder. Kronecker offered an
argument based on the Lagrange interpolation formula to show how one could ﬁnd
out if f (x) had a divisor of any given degree μ, and to determine the coefﬁcients
of the divisor if it exists, in a ﬁnite number of steps. This insistence on exhibiting a
ﬁnite process is characteristic of Kronecker.
He then deﬁned a prime function as an integer or a polynomial that is not divisible
by any other in the domain, and proved that if a product ϕ(x)ψ(x) is divisible by a
prime function P(x) then at least one of ϕ(x) and ψ(x) is so divisible. Finally he
showed that a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients can be written in essentially one
way as a product of prime functions.
In Lecture 20 he broached the generalisation to modular systems in more than one
variable, without going into the proofs in detail. He showed that an integral quantity
F(x, y) can be factored uniquely into irreducible or prime functions, by treating it
as a polynomial in y with coefﬁcients that are polynomials in x. Kronecker now
admitted what he called arbitrary, not merely integral coefﬁcients (it is not clear
this means complex numbers!) so every element in the domain of integrity {x, y}
therefore corresponds to an algebraic equation F(x, y) = 0 and so to an algebraic
curve. Similarly, the elements in the domain of integrity {x, y, z} correspond to
algebraic surfaces.
Kronecker considered the equations divisible by the modular system gener-
ated by (f1(x, y), . . ., fn(x, y)) in {x, y}, and showed that they corresponded to
curves through the common points of the curves with the equations f1(x, y) =
0, · · · , fn(x, y) = 0. Such points he called the fundamental or base points of the
system. Two modular systems are equivalent if they generate the same ideal; for this
to happen in {x, y} it is necessary but not sufﬁcient that they have the same base
points; he gave the example of (x2, y) and (x, y2), which are not equivalent but
have the same base point (the coordinate origin (0, 0)). Similar if vaguer remarks
followed about {x, y, z}.

The deﬁning elements of a modular system in two variables may have a common
curve and also meet in isolated points. If there are no such isolated points, Kronecker
called the system pure, otherwise mixed.
Rather than recapitulate Kronecker’s deﬁnitions, here is one of his examples.
In the domain {x, y, z} (with arbitrary coefﬁcients) a quantity f (x, y, z) is a
prime divisor of the ﬁrst level if and only if it is irreducible, and so the equation
f (x, y, z) = 0 deﬁnes an indecomposable algebraic surface F in 3-dimensional
space. If g(x, y, z) is another integral quantity from the same domain and G the
corresponding surface, then either g is divisible by f , or (f, g) is a modular system
of the second level. In the ﬁrst case, the surface F is part of the surface G. In the
second case the modular system (f, g) corresponds to the complete intersection of
the two surfaces F and G, and therefore to a space curve C. In this latter case, if the
modular system is a prime modular system then the curve is irreducible.
If a third quantity h = h(x, y, z) is taken in {x, y, z} then either h is divisible by
the prime modular system (f, g) or the modular system (f, g, h) is of the third level,
and the three surfaces F, G, and H have only isolated points in common. Whence
the theorem: an irreducible space curve and an algebraic surface either have a ﬁnite
number of common points, or else the curve lies completely in the surface. Similar
considerations allowed Kronecker to give what he called a complete overview of the
geometrical interpretation of the purely arithmetical idea of a prime divisor: divisors
of the ﬁrst, second and third kinds in the domain {x, y, z} correspond to algebraic
surfaces, algebraic curves, and points; prime divisors of these kinds correspond to
indecomposable surfaces, irreducible space curves, and isolated points.
The Grundzüge goes over the ground of the Vorlesungen, in a more visionary
way. As far as geometry is concerned, he noted (§21) that there was a connection
with the theory of hypercomplex numbers. When three variables are taken as
coordinates of space, divisors of the ﬁrst level (Stufe) are either numbers or
polynomials in x, y, z, the vanishing of which represents a surface. Modular systems
of the second level represent either a number or a curve, of the third level, sets of
points. A modular system of level n was deﬁned by Kronecker to be of the principal
class if it was deﬁned by n elements. So, in the principal class of each divisor system
of the second level are those curves which are the complete intersection of two
surfaces. Kronecker commented that this, surprisingly, is a higher viewpoint from
which the representation of integers as norms of complex numbers and the isolated
representation of geometric ﬁgures are seen to be intimately related.

Let us now look at the work of those who took up Kronecker’s ideas. An inﬂuential,
if perhaps unexpected, follower was Jules Molk, who studied in Berlin from 1882–
1884, where he was drawn above all to the teaching of Kronecker. On his return
to Paris he took his Doctorat ès Sciences at the Sorbonne in 1884; we may read
this thesis, lightly revised, in Acta Mathematica (Molk 1885). It is a summary,
with a few simpliﬁcations, of Kronecker’s ideas, coupled with strongly worded

226

claims for its merits; Netto (1896, p. 247) called it a very thorough and well
arranged presentation. Some years later, Molk arranged for an extensive reworking
of Lansdberg’s article on divisor theory in the Encyclopädie der Mathematischen
Wissenschaften for the French Encyclopédie des Sciences Mathématiques pures et
appliquées, of which Molk was editor-in-chief. The authors of that article were
Kürschák and Hadamard. In 1903 and 1904 the Hungarian mathematician Gyula
König wrote the ﬁrst textbook on the subject; in Molk and König we have two
valuable guides to the Grundzüge, with the essays by Landsberg and by Hadamard
and Kürschák to take us further. A paper and a book by the English mathematician
F.S. Macaulay bring this journey to an end.
The work of Gyula (Julius) König, published simultaneously in German and his
native Hungarian, has become almost forgotten. König spent his working life in
Budapest, having studied at Vienna and Heidelberg. He did not claim any personal
acquaintance with Kronecker or reliance on correspondence or letters. Rather, he
seems to have set himself the task, as he turned ﬁfty, of writing a useful book sorting
out an important topic for which no guide existed. Such a work, if successful, will
draw others into the ﬁeld who will go on to discover better results, simpler and
more general methods, and if it does not attain the status of a classic gradually the
work will be covered up and forgotten. Such, at all events, was the fate of König’s
Einleitung in die allgemeine Theorie der algebraischen Gröszen (1903). In view of
its importance in its day, it is worth saying a little about König himself.
The man and his work are well described in Szénássy (1992), where he rates a
chapter to himself. Szénássy calls König ‘a great man of the nation’ (p. 333) and
credits him with establishing Hungarian mathematics as a signiﬁcant force. This
he did as much by his own work as by his magnetic personality and the breadth
of his organisational work: training teachers and engineers as well as professional
mathematicians, lecturing on everything from pure analysis to economics and
history of mathematics. Szénássy writes (1992, p. 241) that Hungarian “secondary
school education beneﬁted for decades from his textbook on algebra”. König helped
found the Hungarian Mathematical Society, worked with publishers, and was three
times Rector of the Technical University. In research, it was his habit to work on
one area of mathematics at a time, publish several papers and then a monograph
summarising the ﬁeld, and then move on. He worked on algebra, then analysis and
partial differential equations, and ﬁnally on Cantorian set theory, where he is better
remembered for his unsuccessful attempt on Cantor’s continuum hypothesis than
for several smaller but secure contributions (see Moore 1982, p. 86).
Szénássy’s discussion of König’s Einleitung is rather brief, and although he
points out the debt to Kronecker and the extent of the new material, much of it
by König himself, it masks the importance of the book by listing its main topics in
unduly modern language. In fact, the book possesses two aspects of interest to us.
One is the novel mathematical concepts it introduces; the other is the insights of a
sharp critic of the period.
From the standpoint of the early history of ﬁeld theory, König’s book introduced
some useful terminology and made some interesting distinctions. He based his
account on the twin concepts of an orthoid domain and a holoid domain. An orthoid

20.4
Gyula (Julius) König
227
domain corresponds exactly to our concepts of a ﬁeld (of characteristic zero) and
a holoid domain to our (commutative) ring with a unit 1 such that no sum of the
form 1 + 1 + ... + 1 vanishes; Szénássy incorrectly glosses a holoid domain as
an integral domain. König gave no rationale for the terms; presumably he had in
mind the Greek roots ‘holo’ for whole or entire and ‘orth’ for straight or right. He
advocated the terms holoid and orthoid to express general properties of domains, by
analogy with the integers and rational numbers.
As König saw it, a ﬁeld, a Körper in Dedekind’s terminology, is an orthoid
domain (certain vaguenesses in Dedekind’s deﬁnitions, and certain methodological
differences, aside). But a ﬁeld or orthoid domain is not the same concept as
Kronecker’s domain of rationality. König argued ﬁrst that Kronecker’s natural
domains were obtained by taking any ﬁnite set of μ elements from any holoid or
orthoid domain, and forming the function ﬁeld in them (so non-trivial relations may
exist among these generators). This gave an orthoid domain that, he said, Kronecker
called a domain of rationality. It might be that just one element was chosen, and
it was equal to 1, in which case the absolute domain of rationality was obtained
(i.e. the rational numbers). If the μ quantities were completely undetermined the
resulting domain was the natural domain of rationality in μ indeterminates.
It follows that every domain of rationality is an algebraic extension of a natural
domain of rationality. His proof was to pick x and form polynomials in x with at
least one non-zero coefﬁcient. Either none vanish or one at least does. In the ﬁrst
case, the domain of rationality is (x), i.e. Q(x). In the second case, x is an algebraic
number and (x), i.e. Q(x), is an algebraic extension. The proof for any ﬁnite number
of elements x follows by induction.
Conversely, if all the elements of an orthoid domain can be written in the
form r1ω1 + · · · rnωn, where the ri belong to a natural domain of rationality
D = (x1, . . . , xm), then the orthoid domain is a domain of rationality. For this,
he ﬁrst showed that every ω in the orthoid domain satisﬁes a polynomial equation
with coefﬁcients in the natural domain of rationality D. In particular, this is true of
the quantities ω1, . . . , ωn, so D and the domain of rationality in which x1, . . . , xm
and ω1, . . . , ωn are adjoined to Q coincide.
The smallest number n of elements ωi is therefore the order of the domain of
rationality thought of as an algebraic extension of its underlying natural domain
of rationality. The elements ω1, . . . , ωn themselves form a basis for the domain of
rationality. But an orthoid domain is not necessarily a domain of rationality. For
example, the domain of all algebraic numbers is an orthoid domain that is not a
domain of rationality. The domains of real and of complex numbers are likewise
orthoid but not, König seems to suggest, domains of rationality.
König found much to criticise. The original papers were very hard to read and
remained restricted to a small circle of readers. They had therefore, he said, failed
in their principal purpose and so he had set himself the task of popularising the
spirit of Kronecker’s method. He was pleased to offer an elementary proof of
Kronecker’s fundamental Theorem. From this he deduced a generalisation of the
concept of resultant to what he called the Resultantform which enabled him to deal
with multiplicities in systems of equations. Geometrically, he gave a general account

228
20
Kronecker’s Algebraic Number Theory
of Noether’s fundamental Theorem in n-dimensional space, which he connected to
results of Hilbert. Arithmetically, he showed how to decompose algebraic integers
in terms of prime ideals.
Kronecker’s fundamental theorem is the result he proved after so much effort in
1883, and which Molk had then re-proved in much the same way, claiming however
that it was elementary. König introduced it for two polynomials in one variable:
f (v) =

i
aixm−i and

i
bixn−i,
whose product is
f (x)g(x) =

i
cixm+n−i.
The Theorem claims that there are identities connecting the products aibj and
homogeneous linear expressions in the ck. Similarly in general, there are identities
connecting the products of the coefﬁcients of any number of polynomials and the
coefﬁcients of the product. König went on to offer a truly elementary (and for
that matter simple) proof of this result. Since Edwards says that Kronecker’s paper
remains obscure to him, and since he then explains just why it is so signiﬁcant, it
is worth digressing to explain what is going on. The matter is discussed in Edwards
(1990, Part 0).
It is a famous result due to Gauss that if the coefﬁcients of the product f (x)g(x)
of two monic polynomials are all integers, then so are all the coefﬁcients of the
polynomials themselves, f (x) and g(x). This can be generalised: if the coefﬁcients
of the product f (x)g(x) are all algebraic integers, then so are all the coefﬁcients of
f (x) and g(x). Dedekind proved that if the coefﬁcients of a product f (x)g(x) are
all integers, then the product of any coefﬁcient of f (x) and any coefﬁcient of g(x)
is an integer (the constituents need no longer be monic). This he then generalised: if
the coefﬁcients of the product f (x)g(x) are all algebraic integers, then the product
of any coefﬁcient of f (x) and any coefﬁcient of g(x) is an algebraic integer. He
published it in 1892, and it became known as his Prague Theorem (because of its
place of publication). Unquestionably he did not know that it was a consequence of
Kronecker’s Theorem published in 1881. Either he had not read that paper or we
have further evidence that it was obscure.
What Kronecker, Molk, and König all proved, in their different ways, is that
the modular system generated by the products aibj and the ck are equivalent in
an extended sense of the term due to Kronecker. Let us call this result the ABC
Theorem. What Landsberg pointed out (Landsberg 1899, p. 312) is that Hilbert’s
Nullstellensatz shows that the concepts of equivalence for systems of equations and
for the corresponding modular systems are not exactly the same. Moreover, this
problem had already been spotted and dealt with by Kronecker, and Kronecker’s
discussion is exactly the theorem we are discussing. Let the module generated by
the products aibj be denoted AB, and that generated by the ck be denoted C. Then

20.4

certainly C is divisible by AB. Conversely, every aibj is the root of polynomial
equation vm + g1vm−1 + · · · gm = 0 whose coefﬁcients are divisible by successive
powers of C (gi by Ci). Kronecker called such a function v “divisible by C in an
extended sense”, and proclaimed the equivalence of the modular systems AB and
C in this sense. In a short paper of 1895, Hurwitz deduced that if the ai and bj are
algebraic integers and the ck are divisible by an algebraic integer ω, then so is every
product aibj. In modern terms this is a theorem about the integral dependence of
ideals.

Revision and Second Assignment
This is the second opportunity to revise the topics so far and now to discuss the
second assignment, and as before it is better to raise some questions and ask you to
answer them yourselves, to your own satisfaction.
Chapter 13 is a difﬁcult one, to be navigated with care. Jordan was the ﬁrst person
to fully understand Galois’s Mémoire. I argue that if you understand what he did you
can make sense of what Galois did, by seeing Galois’s work as fragments that ﬁt into
Jordan’s more detailed picture.
Key technical terms are ‘transitive group’ and ‘composition series’. Be sure you
know what they mean, and then you can ask: What do they do? Where did Jordan
use them, and to what purpose?
Normal subgroups and normal extensions were also introduced, and are vital.
Can you say why? It’s not so easy to spot quotient groups, because Jordan did not
introduce the concept explicitly, but they are there if you look carefully at collections
of cosets.
Chapters 14 and 15 are more methodological and reﬂective. The ﬁrst one argues
for the inﬂuence of Klein in shaping the reception of Galois theory, a fact that has
not been noticed in the literature on the history of the subject. The second one then
attempts to answer the question: Why do we speak of Galois theory at all? Would it
not be enough to speak of ﬁeld theory, or group theory, or the theory of polynomial
equations? The answer I provide ampliﬁes the previous remarks about Klein by
taking the story, albeit brieﬂy, to the start of the twentieth century.
Chapter 16 returns us to the topic of cyclotomy. More evidence is presented that
it was appreciated as a topic, now for the types of new ‘numbers’ it introduced.
What remarkable conclusion did Kummer come to?
Chapter 17 describes Dedekind’s ﬁrst theory of ideals, which he later abandoned,
and Chap. 18 his second theory, which he much preferred. Can you state what was
good about the ﬁrst theory and what was not? On what grounds did he prefer his
second theory? Can you see the merit in the abstract point of view that Dedekind
took?

Revision and Second Assignment
Kronecker usually gets a bad press, although he has always had some vocal
advocates (you might want to consult Edwards (1983), for example). What is
happening to algebra at the hands of these two masters of the subject?
Chapter 19 is the last really hard chapter, in which number theory and the
structural theory of rings come together. This is a part of a larger story that we
shall not discuss, in which the precursor of modern structural algebra can be clearly
seen for the ﬁrst time, but enough is visible here, and it is a good time to look back
over the topics so far. When did school algebra start to disappear behind something
like modern algebra? Notice that not everyone agreed about this.
In Chap. 20 we note that although Kronecker probably did himself no favours
with his confrontational attitudes and his difﬁcult style of writing, he had his
followers, and he is the best example of how things could have been different.
Good questions to ask are: in what ways was his approach to algebra different from
Dedekind’s, and why did some people prefer it? A good ﬁgure to consider would be
Jules Molk.
One aim of the course was to get students to think about the algebra courses
they may have studied from a historical perspective. Opinions and arguments on
such matters are more valuable the more mathematically insightful they are,1 and
the second assessment gives the students a chance to grapple with some celebrated
pieces of mathematics in their original presentations, and then to write about them
(in no more than four pages). I also expected a bibliography of sources, a sensible
use of footnotes, and an intelligent use of the web.
Question 2 Choose one of the following two questions, and write an essay
answering it. In your essay you should demonstrate some understanding of the
mathematics, and be able to situate the people and their ideas in a historical context.
EITHER Describe Galois’s theory of the solution of polynomial equations by
radicals as it was presented by Jordan. What made it a successful explanation of
Galois’s ideas?
OR Given an account of the number theory of binary quadratic forms as it was
presented by Gauss, Dirichlet, and Dedekind. Why was this theory important?
I also offered the following advice.
For the Jordan essay, base your answer largely on the extracts from Jordan’s
Traité. He took several pages to describe what you must reduce to four. To overcome
this difﬁculty, please organise your essay clearly, perhaps in this way:
•
Set aside up to one page to explain why Jordan’s treatment was successful; most
easily, either page 1 or page 4. You may take it for granted that Jordan’s account
was successful; do not investigate the reception of his ideas.
•
In evaluating Jordan’s account you should compare his work with that of Galois
himself, and perhaps with what little you know about Serret; your answer should
draw on information presented elsewhere in your essay.
1Which is not to say that mathematical accuracy is all that matters!

21
Revision and Second Assignment
233
•
A page of your essay should be an account of which quintic equations are
solvable by radicals. It should draw on ideas set out in the previous pages, making
clear what mathematical facts you have had to assume.
For the Dedekind essay, this is your chance to explain a signiﬁcant advance in
the theory of binary quadratic forms.
•
Although the details of what Dedekind did can be intimidating, the task he set
himself, of translating a structured theory of quadratic form s into a structured
theory of a particular class of modules, conforms to a particular operation
familiar to us: try to bring out the key steps. Make an assessment of what
is difﬁcult and what, although perhaps long, is more routine, and let these
judgements guide your presentation.
•
Set aside one page for your investigation of the historical context, either page 1 or
page 3. Make clear what was the evolving contemporary attitude to the subject:
what was important? what was difﬁcult? where was progress being made?
•
The fourth and ﬁnal page of your essay should be an account of why the theory
of binary quadratic forms is so interesting: give some substantial mathematical
example(s). It should draw on ideas set out in the previous pages, making clear
what mathematical facts you have had to assume. You need not restrict your
attention to the theory of binary quadratic forms, but do not bring in irrelevant
information.
More generally:
•
You may assume the truth of any mathematical facts you state provided you state
them clearly and provided they are widely known outside the present context (e.g.
the fundamental theorem of algebra, the group A5 is simple, the fundamental
theorem of algebra, the prime factorisation theorem for rational integers).
•
Mathematical facts that belong more intimately to Galois theory or number
theory (for example, which you learned for the ﬁrst time in this course) should
be treated as an opportunity to display your understanding of the theory. There is
one exception: you need not prove the theorem of quadratic reciprocity.
•
As a general rule do not go back before 1800. It is enough to say, for example,
‘(known earlier to Lagrange)’. But do not exclude results just because they were
known earlier, especially if you think they are among the highlights of the theory.
•
Biographical information should be kept to a minimum.

Chapter 22
Algebra at the End of the Nineteenth
Century
22.1
Introduction
Here we begin to look at the major change that happened to algebra in the nineteenth
century: the transformation from polynomial algebra to modern algebra. A vivid
impression of the subject is given by the book that described the state of the art
around 1900, Weber’s Lehrbuch der Algebra, much of which described Galois
theory and number theory as it then stood.
22.2
Heinrich Weber and His Textbook of Algebra
Heinrich Weber’s name is known to mathematicians these days, if at all, in
connection with class ﬁeld theory and the Kronecker–Weber theorem, which says
that every abelian extension of the rationals is a subﬁeld of a cyclotomic extension.
But in his day he was regarded as a leading algebraist, the ﬁnest exponent of the
Riemannian tradition in complex analysis, and as the co-author, with his friend
Dedekind, of one of the most important papers on the subject of algebraic curves
and function ﬁelds. In particular, his three-volume Lehrbuch der Algebra, published
between 1895 and 1896 (second edition 1904–1908), may be taken as the deﬁnitive
presentation of the subject for its time. (Vol. 1 appeared in French in 1898).1
Weber was born in 1842, graduated in mathematics from the University of
Heidelberg and took his PhD from there in 1863. He taught in a number of places,
including the Polytechnic in Zurich (later known as the ETH, where he met and
became friends with Dedekind), Königsberg, and Göttingen, before becoming a
Professor at the University of Strasburg in 1895. Among his pupils at Königsberg

were Hilbert and Minkowski. Strasburg, it should be said, was a contentious
position. The town, as part of Alsace and Lorraine, had been taken from the French
by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870–1871, and was to be reclaimed
by the French after the First World War (when it became Strasbourg again).

Volume I of the Lehrbuch der Algebra opens with chapters on ‘The Foundations’:
rational functions, determinants, roots of algebraic equations, symmetric functions,
linear transformations and invariants, and the Tschirnhaus transformation. Book two
(of volume I) discusses the reality of the roots of a polynomial equation and how
they can be found or approximated—weshall not be concerned with it but notice that
it was regarded as belonging to algebra at the time. Book three, the last in volume
I, was on algebraic quantities: Galois theory, the application of permutation groups
to equations, cyclic equations, cyclotomy, the algebraic solution of equations, and,
last of all, the roots of metacyclic equations.
Volume II began with a book on groups: general group theory, then abelian
groups, the groups of the cyclotomic ﬁelds, cubic and quartic abelian ﬁelds, the
constitution (i.e., structure) of general groups. Book two covered linear groups
including the polyhedral groups and congruence groups. Book three looked at
applications of group theory: metacyclic equations, the geometry of cubic and
quartic curves, the general theory of curves of degree 5, and ﬁnally two chapters
on the group G168. Book four was on algebraic number theory: numbers and
functions in an algebraic ﬁeld, general theory, ﬁelds and subﬁelds, lattices, the
class number, cyclotomic ﬁelds, cyclotomic ﬁelds, abelian ﬁelds and cyclotomy, and
transcendental numbers (e and π had recently been shown to be transcendental).

22.2
Weber’s Textbook
237
Volume III (‘dedicated in heartfelt friendship’ to Dedekind, Hilbert, and Min-
kowski) was much more analytic. Book 1: elliptic integrals, theta functions, elliptic
functions, modular functions, transformation theory, and the quintic equation. Book
2: quadratic ﬁelds, algebraic numbers, ideals, composition of forms and ideals, the
genus of quadratic forms, the class number of ideals in quadratic ﬁelds and the
application to genera. Book 3: elliptic functions and quadratic forms, the Galois
theory of the class equation, calculation of class invariants, complex multiplication.
Book 4: class ﬁeld theory. Book 5: algebraic functions, functionals, values of
algebraic functions, algebraic and abelian differentials, and the Riemann–Roch
theorem.
All this in roughly 700 + 850 + 725 = 2275 pages.
What are we to make of this? Obviously there are some unfamiliar words:
metacyclic, for example, although you may recall it was introduced by Jordan
in his Traité.2 There are some buzzwords that may not be known to you: class
ﬁeld theory, the Riemann–Roch theorem. Some unexpected topics: the geometry of
algebraic curves, and, even more unexpected, all that analysis. You would be correct
in presuming that they are included because of some deep link between these topics
and more mainstream algebra. Even that’s worth noticing: they are there because
they link to algebra, not because they are part of algebra.
Can we say that any of this is familiar or expected? The topics of polynomial
equations and Galois theory are reassuringly present, perhaps at intimidating length,
as is something about groups in general, and another large tranche of material on
algebraic number theory.
And, not to look ahead too much because historians should not do that, there are
missing words—ring, for example—and ﬁeld theory seems tied to algebraic number
theory and Galois theory rather than being an independent subject.
This suggests that we should look into the material on Galois theory and
algebraic number theory to see how it connects to what we know has been going
on beforehand and in what way it reformulates or advances the subject. Then we
should try and see if the unfamiliar material paints an interesting picture of what
algebra was taken to be just over 100 years ago.
We should also note that in 1893 Weber published a more advanced, research,
paper on Galois theory which takes a more abstract approach to the subject. In the
preface to that paper he wrote (1893, p. 521):
In the following, an attempt is made to present the Galois theory of algebraic equations
in a way which will include equally well all cases in which this theory might be used.
Thus we present it here as a direct consequence of the group concept illumined by the ﬁeld
concept, as a formal structure completely without reference to any numerical interpretation
of the elements used. Thus this development which follows is even independent of
the fundamental theorem of algebra on the existence of roots. The theory under this
interpretation appears simply as a direct formalization which ﬁrst gains meaning and
2Weber explained that an equation was metacyclic when it was completely solvable by a chain of
cyclic equations. It follows that the roots of such an equation are expressible in terms of nested
radicals.

238

existence by the substitution of some one element with a numerical interpretation. In this
way, this method of procedure is applicable to every conceivable case in which the given
hypotheses hold, running from Function Theory on the one hand to Number Theory on the
other.3
We can also observe that even a mathematician as insightful as Georg Frobenius
could write to Weber in 1893 to say4
Your announcement of a work on algebra makes me very happy . . . . Hopefully you will
follow Dedekind’s way, yet avoid the highly abstract approach that he so eagerly pursues
now. His newest edition (of the Vorlesungen) contains so many beautiful ideas, . . . but his
permutations are too ﬂimsy, and it is indeed unnecessary to push the abstraction so far. I am
therefore satisﬁed, that you write the Algebra and not our venerable friend and master, who
had also once considered that plan.
Frobenius, as the man who would emerge as the leader of his generation of math-
ematicians in Berlin, was a master of technical as well as conceptual mathematics,
notably in the areas of algebra and abelian function theory, so his reluctance to
go all the way with Dedekind is understandable, but this letter still testiﬁes to the
disturbing novelty of Dedekind’s approach.
22.3
Galois Theory
Weber began Volume 1, Book 3, with a quick introduction to ﬁelds in the manner of
his friend Dedekind. These are settings where addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division (other than by zero) are permitted, whether of numbers or functions.
The ﬁeld consisting of zero alone is explicitly excluded from further consideration.
This means that a multiplicative unit was not necessarily part of a ﬁeld by deﬁnition,
or so it would seem; nor can I see an opinion either way on the commutativity of
multiplication—it is present in all the examples Weber gave. It also seems that all
the ﬁelds Weber will consider are inﬁnite and of characteristic zero (the concept of
characteristic does not appear).
On to algebraic functions, irreducibility, adjunction of elements to a ﬁeld,
primitive and imprimitive ﬁelds, normal ﬁelds and Galois resolvents. By now it
looks like we’re into deep water. Then comes a section on permutation groups,
Galois groups, transitive and intransitive groups, primitive and imprimitive groups.
So far, it looks as if this is a story about polynomial equations and their roots,
which are taken to generate extension ﬁelds of the rational numbers, and in which
permutation groups will play a supporting role. There are some terms we may think
we know the meaning of, and some that are new, such as normal ﬁelds.
The chapter on permutation groups runs through the basics (not entirely in the
modern way, as we shall see) and then introduces the idea of subgroups (divisors,
3As quoted in Kiernan (1971, p. 136).
4Quoted in Corry (1996, p. 128) from Dugac (1976, p. 269). On Frobenius, see Hawkins (2013).

they are called), the reduction of a Galois resolvent and the concept of a normal
subgroup of a group, and ﬁnishes with imprimitive groups. This is likely to be
reassuring because familiar, but not easy.
Then comes a chapter on the classical examples: the cubic equation, the
quartic equation, what Weber called abelian equations and their reduction to cyclic
equations, Lagrange resolvents, the solution of cyclic equations, and the division of
angles into equal parts.
I’m going to skip over most of the chapter on cyclotomy, and note only that
Weber discussed the Gaussian integers. Here he showed that irreducible Gaussian
integers are prime, and that this was true because there was an algorithm for ﬁnding
highest common factors. To make the point more secure, he showed that the same
result was true for the algebraic integers in the ﬁeld Q with a cube root of unity
adjoined, say ρ =
1
2(−1 +
√
−3). These integers can be written in the form
1
2(m + n
√
−3). He concluded by listing (up to multiplication by units) all the prime
algebraic integers of this form with a norm less than 200.
Next we come to the chapter on the algebraic solution of equations. Here we ﬁnd
such topics as the simplicity of the alternating group and the question of when the
radicals are real, alongside investigations into metacyclic equations that conclude
the book and indeed Volume I. Here he showed, for example, that Galois’s group
G20 of order 20 is a metacyclic group, and he discussed ideas that Kronecker had
introduced about the speciﬁc form of the roots of a metacyclic equation.
Let us now take a more detailed look at the treatment of Galois theory. The ﬁrst
comment Weber made that is worth noting is this: if an irreducible function f (x)
has a common factor with a function F(x) whose coefﬁcients lie in the same ﬁeld,
then f (x) divides F(x). It follows that if F(x) vanishes for a single root of f (x)
then it vanishes for all of them, and if F(x) is of lower degree than f (X) then it
must be identically zero. Finally, the decomposition of a function into irreducible
factors is essentially unique.
Weber moved quickly to consider an algebraic ﬁeld Ω(α), where α satisﬁes
a (possibly reducible) polynomial equation F(x) without repeated roots, whose
coefﬁcients are in the ﬁeld Ω. If the polynomial is reducible then α satisﬁes a unique
irreducible polynomial among its factors, say f (x) of degree n, and this raises the
possibility of adjoining not α but any of the other roots: α1, . . . , αn−1, obtaining the
ﬁelds Ω(αi). These ﬁelds are called conjugate ﬁelds and they may or may not be
isomorphic—a question Weber would return to.
Weber let t stand for any of the αs and observed that every element of Ω(t)
can be written as a polynomial χ of degree at most n −1 in t. In this way one
obtains the n quantities Θi = χ(αi), one in each conjugate ﬁeld; these are called
conjugate quantities. Their sum is called the trace (German: Spur) and their product

240
22
Algebra at the End of the Nineteenth Century
the norm (German: Norm). Conjugate numbers have the same trace and norm. A
consideration of the polynomial
(t −Θ)(t −Θ1) . . . (t −Θn−1) = Φ(t)
shows that every element in Ω(α) is a root of an equation of degree n whose other
roots are the corresponding conjugate quantities.
Finally Weber deduced that one of two situations occurs:
1. The function Φ(t) is irreducible, and the conjugates of a number in Ω(α) are all
distinct, or
2. The function Φ(t) is reducible, when it is an irreducible polynomial of degree n1
raised to the power n2, and the conjugates of a number in Ω(α) form n2 systems
of n1 identical numbers.
The led him to the important deﬁnition of a primitive element of quantity in the
ﬁeld Ω(α): it is an element different from all of its conjugates and therefore satisﬁes
an irreducible equation of degree n. By an earlier result, there are inﬁnitely many
primitive elements. Whence the theorem:
Theorem (Theorem of the Primitive Element). Every element of a ﬁeld Ω(α) can
be written rationally in terms of an arbitrary primitive element of the ﬁeld.
Weber next observed that the ﬁelds Ω(αi) are all of the same degree, so if one is
contained in the other those two are identical. He deﬁned a normal ﬁeld to be one
identical with all its conjugates. He remarked that normal ﬁelds are much easier to
study than arbitrary ﬁelds, and that it was the great achievement of Galois to show
how an arbitrary ﬁeld can be reduced to a normal ﬁeld, which is why normal ﬁelds
are sometimes called Galois ﬁelds. It would be a good historical exercise to say what
Weber meant by this and how much conﬁdence can be attached to it as a judgement.
Likewise, Weber called an equation a normal or Galois equation if it is irreducible
and all its roots can be expressed rationally in terms of any one of them. So a
primitive element of a normal ﬁeld of degree μ is a root of a normal equation of
degree μ. He then deﬁned a Galois resolvent to be a normal equation.
Since all the conjugates of a normal ﬁeld are related rationally, it follows that
a permutation of the roots is known completely once it is known on one root, so
the group of permutations has order μ—and Weber showed that these permutations
do indeed form a group. As a result he was led to review the basic results about
permutation groups.
Weber then turned to deﬁne the Galois group of an equation. He took an equation
F(x) with m roots α, α1, . . . , αm−1 that are elements of a normal ﬁeld Ω(ρ) of
degree μ. Then any permutation of the roots of the normal equation that deﬁnes the
ﬁeld Ω(ρ) is also a permutation of the roots of F(x), and as such can be thought of
as a permutation of the symbols {0, 1, · · · , m −1}. This permutation group Weber
called the Galois group of the equation F(x) = 0, adding that if F(x) is irreducible
then the group is also called the Galois group of each of the ﬁelds Ω(αi).

22.3
Galois Theory
241
He then showed that the Galois group had properties that distinguished between
reducible and irreducible equations F(x). Speciﬁcally, the Galois group is tran-
sitive if and only if the equation is irreducible. Weber concluded the chapter by
establishing that primitive ﬁelds have primitive groups and imprimitive ﬁelds have
imprimitive groups.
Weber now looked further into the theory of permutation groups. He called a
subgroup Q of a permutation group P a divisor of P, which gave him this handy
result: the degree of a divisor of a group is a divisor of the degree of P. This result
(which we would call Lagrange’s theorem) he attributed rather more accurately to
Cayley. He denoted a normal ﬁeld Ω(ρ) = Ω(α1, . . . , αm) by N, and proved that to
every divisor (subgroup) Q of P there were what he called corresponding elements
of N, and that corresponding elements in N correspond to a divisor (subgroup) Q
of P. By corresponding in this context he meant elements of N that are left ﬁxed
by every element or permutation in the subgroup Q. He then showed that if Qπ is a
coset of Q in P—something he called a near group (German: Nebengruppe)—then
the elements of the coset are precisely those that send a function ψ corresponding to
Q to the same function ψ1. Weber also noted that π−1Qπ is a permutation group,
which he said was derived from or conjugate to Q.
Weber now turned to the reduction of a Galois resolvent. He supposed that P
was a Galois group of degree p, Q a subgroup of degree q and index j, so qj = p,
and ψ a function corresponding to Q. He denoted the quantities conjugate to ψ by
ψ1, . . . , ψj−1, and his ﬁrst important result in the chapter was that these quantities
are the roots of an irreducible equation of degree j. From this he deduced what he
called Lagrange’s theorem: Every element of the ﬁeld N that is invariant under the
group Q is contained in the ﬁeld Ω(ψ) when ψ is a function corresponding to Q.
He then deduced that when ψ is adjoined to Ω then the group of N is reduced to
Q. So N is a ﬁeld of degree p over Ω and of degree q over Ω(ψ). The reduction of
the Galois group corresponds to a factorisation of the Galois resolvent. He observed,
without offering an example, that if Q is normal in P and R is normal in Q then R
is a divisor (subgroup) of P but not necessarily normal. However, if R is a divisor
(subgroup) of Q that is also normal in P then R is normal in Q.
Of particular interest, he said, was the case when all the conjugate groups
π−1Qπ are the same, in which case the ﬁeld Ω(ψ) is a normal ﬁeld over Ω. Such
a subgroup is therefore called, he said, a normal divisor (German: normal Theiler),
adding in a footnote that Galois had spoken of a proper decomposition, whence the
expression ‘proper divisor’ that was also in use, while more recent authors called a
normal divisor a ‘distinguished or invariant subgroup’.
A sharper ﬂavour of Weber’s version of the theory may be given by observing that
his account of the quartic equation was driven by a search for transitive subgroups
of the permutation group S4. These subgroups were then tied to the resolvents that
enter the explicit solution of the fourth degree equation. The burden of explanation
was evidently shifted from expressions to subgroups. In line with what we discussed
in Chap. 15, Weber’s presentation plainly owes much more to Klein than Kronecker.

Algebra at the End of the Nineteenth Century
22.4
Number Theory
Weber discussed the general theory of algebraic number ﬁelds in Volume II, Book 4,
of his Lehrbuch. He reviewed the basic deﬁnitions of algebraic numbers, algebraic
integers, and prime factorisation, and discussed ﬁeld extensions. He then moved on
to deﬁne what he called Dedekind ideals in the collection of all algebraic integers
in an algebraic number ﬁeld. I shall denote a given ﬁeld of algebraic numbers by K
and the algebraic integers in that ﬁeld by A.
Given a ﬁxed K and A, a (Dedekind) ideal is a family of algebraic integers closed
under addition and subtraction and under multiplication by any algebraic integer in
A. So A, the family of all algebraic integers in the ﬁeld, is an ideal, as is the family of
all multiples of an algebraic integer ν, written νA. Such an ideal is called a principal
ideal.
Weber then observed that if a and b are two ideals in A, then so is their product,
written ab and deﬁned to be all ﬁnite sums of the form 
j ajbj with aj ∈a and
bj ∈b. Moreover, he said, this ideal deserves to be called the greatest common
divisor of A, because it is the largest ideal that is a sub-ideal (or divisor, German:
Theiler) of both a and b.
Weber then followed Dedekind in deﬁning the norm of an ideal and the
equivalence of ideals (see below), and he then proved that the number of ideal
classes in a number ﬁeld is ﬁnite. Then he moved on to the factorisation of prime
algebraic integers in an extension ﬁeld, and a great deal more. Some 200 pages after
he began he reached the particular cases of abelian and cyclotomic ﬁelds.
In Volume III, Book 2, Weber returned to the topic and looked at quadratic ﬁelds.
I shall concentrate on this part of his Lehrbuch, but treat it in a very selective way.
He deﬁned the discriminant of such a ﬁeld (following Kronecker) as any non-zero
(rational) integer congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4, and so capable of being a value of an
expression of the form b2−4ac. He ﬁxed a square-free integer d, and considered the
ﬁeld Q(
√
d). The algebraic integers in this ﬁeld are of the form m+n
√
d, where are
m and n are rational integers if d ≡2 or 3 (mod 4), and of the form 1
2(m + n
√
d),
where are m and n are rational integers and both even or both odd if d ≡1 (mod 4).
This distinction between d ≡2, 3 and d ≡1 mod 4 runs right through the theory
from now on. Weber now took the discriminant of the ﬁeld, Δ, to be 4d in the 2, 3
case and d in the 1 case.
He now showed how to pass between ideals in a quadratic ﬁeld (better, the
associated ring of quadratic integers) and the quadratic forms of the appropriate
discriminant. He took an ideal a with a basis (α1, α2) and deﬁned λ = α1t1 + α2t2.
The norm of the ideal is N(a), and the norm of λ is N(λ), where
N(λ) = N(a)T,
where T = at2
1 + bt1t2 + ct2
2, and T is a primitive binary quadratic form with
discriminant b2 −4ac = Δ.

22.4
Number Theory
243
Conversely, Weber showed how to start from a primitive quadratic form of
discriminant Δ and arrive at an ideal with a basis (α1, α2). More precisely he showed
(I omit the proof) that from the form at2
1 + bt1t2 + ct2
2 one deﬁnes the number
ω = −b+
√
Δ
2a
and the required ideal is (a, aω).
Weber, following Dedekind, next recalled that two ideals a and b are equivalent
if there is a number (not necessarily an integer) η in the ﬁeld such that ηa = b. If it is
stipulated that η be an integer, then a stricter deﬁnition of equivalence is deﬁned, but
the distinction evaporates if all norms are positive or if there is a unit of norm −1.
He now disentangled the algebra and showed that two equivalent ideals give rise to
two equivalent quadratic forms. A similar argument but in reverse shows that two
equivalent forms give rise to two equivalent ideals. It then followed from the general
theory in Volume II that the form corresponding to the product of two ideals was the
composition of the forms corresponding separately to each ideal. In (our symbols) if
the form corresponding to the ideal a is (a, b, c) and the form corresponding to the
ideal a′ is (a′, b′, c′) then the form corresponding to the ideal aa′ is the composite
of the two forms (a, b, c) and (a′, b′, c′). In other words: the complicated operation
of the Gaussian combination of forms is reduced entirely to the multiplication of the
corresponding ideals.
Weber did much more, but I shall not pursue him here. He deﬁned an order
(German: Ordnung), and noted that while Dedekind had chosen the word ‘order’
because he was interested in Gauss’s ‘orders’ in the theory of quadratic forms,
Hilbert had recently preferred the new term ‘ring’ for the same object. The collection
of all algebraic integers in Q(
√
d) is an order. The Gaussian composition extends
to orders and genera, and it is possible to re-write it in the language of ideals.
Weber considered the theory of prime factorisation, quadratic reciprocity in this
new setting, and concluded with a discussion of the class number of a quadratic
ﬁeld.
Optional Note on the Kronecker–Weber Theorem
The theorem states that a ﬁeld extension K of the rationals, Q, that has an abelian
Galois group is contained in a cyclic extension Q(e2πi/n) for some integer n. A
proof would go too far aﬁeld, but here is an interesting example.
Suppose that K = Q(
√
5) and consider the Gauss sum (see the exercises to
Chap. 6)
τ =
5

j=1
j
5

e2πij/5.
On the one hand, τ ∈Q(e2πi/5). On the other hand, τ 2 = 5, so τ = ±
√
5. So
K < Q(e2πi/5).

The Concept of an Abstract Field
23.1
Introduction
Here we look at three aspects of the theory of abstract ﬁelds: the discovery
that all ﬁnite ﬁelds are ‘Galois’ ﬁelds; Dedekind’s presentation of the ‘Galois
correspondence’ between groups and ﬁeld extensions; and the emergence of the
concept of an abstract ﬁeld.
23.2
Moore, Dickson, and Galois Fields
In 1830, Galois had published a short paper on arithmetic modulo a prime p.1 In it
he considered expressions of the form
a0 + a1i + a2i2 + · · · aν−1iν−1
(A)
in which the ajs are integers modulo p, and i is a quantity that Galois called
imaginary (whence the later name ‘Galois imaginaries’ for the roots of equations
with coefﬁcients in a ﬁnite ﬁeld) and said was a root of an irreducible polynomial
mod p of degree ν, and so, in what he noted was Gauss’s notation, a solution of the
equation
F(x) ≡0
mod p.
1See Galois (1830, pp. 428–435). This paper was a part of Galois’s study of what he called
primitive equations, the topic of his second Mémoire. Accordingly it cannot be pursued further
here.

The Concept of an Abstract Field
He remarked that (A) has pν possible values that enjoy the same properties as
natural numbers, and he then claimed that values of the aj can be chosen so that
every one of these expressions other than zero is a power of α = a0 + a1i + a2i2 +
· · · aν−1iν−1. His unstated argument may well have been that every expression of
this form satisﬁes a congruence of the form αk = 1 for some n dividing pν −1, and
the roots of these equations for n < pν −1 do not exhaust the collection of elements
of the form (A)—“as in the theory of numbers”, as he put it.
He went on2
One sees now the remarkable consequence that all algebraic quantities which can appear in
the theory are roots of equations of the form
xpν = x.
In other words, every expression of the form in (A) satisﬁes the equation in the
quoted remark. This result has become known as the existence of a primitive element
for a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or in other words, the theorem that the multiplicative group of a
ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic. The reason is that one has
(F(x))pn = F(xpn),
so if x is one of the roots of F the others are the successive powers of x.
He then claimed the converse, that the roots of the congruence
xpν ≡x
mod p
all depend on a single congruence of degree ν. This means that this congruence
has exactly pν distinct roots.3 Finally he made some remarks about how to ﬁnd
a suitable irreducible congruence of degree ν, which would lead to an explicit
representation of a primitive element.
His programmatic remarks are striking. He wrote4:
The principal beneﬁt of the new theory that we have just expounded is to carry over to
congruences the property (so useful in ordinary equations) of admitting precisely as many
roots as there are units in the order of their degree
I made tacit use of this fact as a shortcut at several points in the early chapters.
Galois went on5:
It is above all in the theory of permutations, where one forever needs to vary the form
of [the] indices, that consideration of the imaginary roots of congruences appears to be
2I take the quote below from Neumann (2011, p. 65).
3In modern language, if Fp denotes the ﬁeld of p elements, then expressions of the form in (A) are
elements of the set Fp(x) modulo the polynomial F(x), and that when F(x) is irreducible over Fp
this set is a ﬁeld of pν elements, as Galois claimed.

indispensable. It gives a simple and easy means of recognising the cases in which a primitive
equation is soluble by radicals, of which I shall try to give an idea in two words.
We shall not follow him here but proceed to the ﬁnal page of this short paper,
where Galois talked about primitive equations of degree pν that are solvable by
radicals.6 He had already stated that only equations of prime power degree can be
both primitive and solvable by radicals, and at this point he considered the case
ν = 1. He noted that the substitutions of the group are of the form (xk, xak+b)
– which we might write as k →ak + b – as k runs through the whole numbers
(strictly speaking, modulo p). Galois noted that there will be p(p −1) of these
substitutions.
It is a melancholy reﬂection that these ideas of Galois, published in 1830 and
again by Liouville in 1846, did not ﬁnd their ideal reader until Jordan in the early
1860s.
By the end of the century it was generally agreed that Galois had established that
his process does produce a ﬁeld of the given size. The converse (that every ﬁnite
ﬁeld with pn elements is generated by a single element of order pn for some prime
p and some integer n) was taken to be an open conjecture until it was established by
the American mathematician E.H. Moore in his (1896). He had presented the result
at the Chicago Congress of Mathematics in 1893, but the Mathematical Papers were
only published three years later. It follows that up to isomorphism there is only one
ﬁeld of each possible order.
Moore argued as follows in his (1896, pp. 211–216). Let μ be a non-zero element
of a ﬁnite ﬁeld F, then there is an integer c such that the sum of c copies of μ
vanishes, but no smaller sum vanishes (c was later called the characteristic of the
ﬁeld). This number c is the same for all non-zero μ (it is the value of c for the
element 1 of the ﬁeld), and it is a prime integer, say q. The elements 0, 1, 2, . . . , (q−
1) form a ﬁeld of q elements, Fq. Now suppose that there are h elements of the ﬁeld,
say ν1, . . . , νh, but not h + 1, for which the equation
n1ν1 + n2ν2 + · · · + nhνh = 0,
where the nj are elements of Fq, forces n1 = · · · = nh = 0. (The elements νj are
said to be linearly independent.) Then there are qh expressions of the form n1ν1 +
n2ν2+· · ·+nhνh, and they form a ﬁeld. Furthermore, every element of the ﬁeld must
be of this form (else h would not be maximal). Finally, every element of the ﬁeld
satisﬁes a polynomial of degree at most h, else for some element μ the elements
1, μ, . . . , μh would be linearly independent. Therefore the ﬁnite ﬁeld is a Galois
ﬁeld.
6For a careful discussion of the meaning of the term ‘primitive’ in Galois’s work as it applies to
equations and to groups, see Neumann (2006).

The Concept of an Abstract Field
23.3
Dedekind’s 11th Supplement, 1894
After the long introduction to the supplement, Dedekind began in §160 with the
deﬁnition of a ﬁeld (German: Körper) of real or complex numbers.7 He deﬁned
this as a collection of numbers closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division (division by zero being excluded). If a ﬁeld A is contained in another
ﬁeld B Dedekind called A a divisor of B and B a multiple of A, natural choices of
names that might also reveal his ultimate focus on number theory. He observed that
the intersection of a family of ﬁelds is again a ﬁeld, which he called the greatest
common divisor (gcd) of the ﬁelds, and he deﬁned the concept of the least common
multiple of a family of ﬁelds as the gcd of all the ﬁelds containing the given ﬁelds—
recall that by deﬁnition they are all subﬁelds of C.
He then discussed what he called a permutation of a number ﬁeld, and we
would call a homomorphism, and explained that it can be thought of as a mapping
(Abbildung, in German) of one ﬁeld to another. He deﬁned it as obeying these rules:
(u + v)′ = u′ + v′, (uv)′ = u′v′,
with analogous rules for subtraction and division. The image of a ﬁeld under a
permutation is a ﬁeld, and a permutation is a one-to-onemap, so a ﬁeld is isomorphic
(as we would say) with its image. This allowed Dedekind to consider permutations
of a ﬁeld to itself, and to look at the collection of all permutations of a ﬁeld to itself,
which indeed form a group.
In the case where a ﬁeld B is an extension (or, as he said, a multiple) of a ﬁeld A
Dedekind also looked at the permutations of B that leave the elements of A ﬁxed;
he said these permutations of B were single-valued on elements of A but could be
n-valued on other elements of B. Conversely, the elements of a ﬁeld B for which a
given collection of permutations is single-valued form a subﬁeld of B. Indeed, this
is true if B is replaced by a family of ﬁelds.
In §164 Dedekind began “the detailed investigation of the relationship between
different ﬁelds”, adding the striking comment “and herein lies the real subject of
today’s algebra” (“der eigentliche Gegenstand der heutigen Algebra”). He now
looked at ﬁnite degree extensions of one ﬁeld by another, and proved what have
become the familiar theorems about them, such as that if B is an extension of A
of degree m and C is an extension of B of degree n then C is an extension of A
of degree mn. The realisation that an extension ﬁeld can be thought of as a vector
space with coefﬁcients in the subﬁeld is a driving force behind many of the proofs,
along with basic facts about linear dependence and independence.
7See the translation of §§160–166 in Dean (2009) and Dean’s commentary for a proof of the results
summarised here, and a thoughtful commentary and a disagreement with Kiernan’s account of the
same material.

23.4
Kürschák and Hadamard
249
In §166 he came to the theorem that if a ﬁeld B is an extension of A and G is the
group of permutations of B that are single-valued on A then the order of the group
is equal to the degree of B over A.
Now he considered the case in which there is a collection of ﬁelds A′, A′′, . . .
that have A as a subﬁeld and are themselves subﬁelds of B, and deduced that “the
complete determination of all these ﬁelds A′, A′′, . . . and the investigation of their
mutual relations is completely settled by the determination of all groups G′, G′′, . . .
contained in the group G.
The statement that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the lattice of
intermediate ﬁelds of two ﬁelds A and B and the corresponding groups is today
known as the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. To be correct, some assumption
has to be placed on the ﬁeld extensions, and in modern accounts that is that the
extension of A by B is normal.8 Dedekind recognised this by insisting that all the
homomorphisms of intermediate ﬁelds that are single-valued on A ﬁx only A and
no larger ﬁeld.9
As Dean (2009) points out, this is a clear statement of the fundamental theorem,
at least for subﬁelds of C, and it is strikingly conceptual. The crucial intermediate
step between Dedekind’s account and a modern one, say Artin (1942), was to be
taken by Steinitz, as we shall shortly see.
23.4
Kürschák and Hadamard
József Kürschák was a Hungarian mathematician educated in Budapest. He organ-
ised seminars with König, and König thanked him for his help during the writing
of his Einleitung. He also shared something of his mentor’s breadth of interests and
his inﬂuence. One sign of this is a prize competition organised for school leavers in
mathematics and physics, which is named after him. In the early 1890s he came into
contact with Hadamard because of his study of the relation between the simple pole
of a power series and its coefﬁcients. This stimulated Hadamard to investigate what
conditions on a power series yield particular types of singularity. One supposes,
in the absence of evidence, that it was Molk who encouraged them to expand
upon Landsberg’s article in the Encyclopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften
when he came to organise the French version for his Encyclopédie. At all events,
it is a much larger article than the German original, and its comments provide an
interesting view of how all this material was regarded in 1910–1911. It is not clear,
however, what impact this article had; references to it are hard to ﬁnd. Let us take
it, then, as a snapshot of the times.
8In the setting of subﬁelds of C the condition that all extensions be separable is met automatically.
9Dedekind expressed matters somewhat differently, see the commentary in Dean (2009, pp. 15–
16).

250
23
The Concept of an Abstract Field
The ﬁrst part was published on 30 August 1910. The title is interesting in itself:
Propriétés générales des Corps et des Variétés Algébriques (‘General properties
of ﬁelds and algebraic varieties’). Landsberg’s had been ‘IB1c Algebraic varieties.
IC5 Arithmetic theory of algebraic quantities’, so it is clear that the editors had not
been sure where to place it, because IB is devoted to algebra and IC to number
theory. Generally speaking, Hadamard and Kürschák kept Kronecker’s approach at
a distance, setting off material speciﬁcally of that nature in square brackets [...].
They reviewed the proliferating terminology carefully. The term ‘known quan-
tities’ had given way to Dedekind’s ‘ﬁeld’, which was the same thing as König’s
orthoid domain. Kronecker’s domain of rationality was also a ﬁeld, more precisely
a ﬁnite or algebraic extension of the rationals (the terms ‘ﬁnite’ and ‘algebraic’
were regarded as synonyms by Hadamard and Kürschák). There were two sorts of
ﬁeld: number ﬁelds and function ﬁelds, but every ﬁeld contained the ﬁeld of rational
numbers, which they denoted R. Hadamard and Kürschák regarded the simplest
function ﬁeld as the function ﬁeld in n variables, which they denoted indifferently
R. The coefﬁcients were to be unrestricted numerically, which means complex
numbers. If the coefﬁcients were restricted in any way, say to be rational, they wrote
the ﬁeld RR . They admitted this was back to front from Kronecker’s approach.
What they called ﬁnite or algebraic ﬁelds in the strict sense of the word were
simple algebraic extensions of any of the ﬁelds just deﬁned, to wit, the ﬁelds that
Kronecker had called derived domains of rationality, reserving the term natural for
just the ﬁelds in the paragraph above. They also presented the concept of a ﬁeld
in purely formal terms (analogous to that of a group, they said). A commutative
group is a ﬁeld, they said, when it also admits an associative multiplication with
a multiplicative identity, and when every element that is not a divisor of zero
has a unique multiplicative inverse. Weber’s deﬁnition was more restrictive, they
observed: the multiplication must be commutative, and there are no zero divisors.
König’s orthoid domains satisﬁed all these conditions and were of characteristic 0.
What he called a hyperorthoid domain dropped the condition about divisors of 0. For
example, the domain {a + bx : a, b ∈C, x2 = 0}. König called a domain pseudo-
orthoid if it had no divisors of 0, but was not of characteristic 0. They arose, for
example, by taking numbers modulo a prime. So pseudo-orthoid domains were also
ﬁelds in Weber’s sense of the term. Hadamard and Kürschák settled on the deﬁnition
of ﬁeld that agreed with König’s orthoid domain. What is notable is that at this stage
in the paper they were unable to take on board Steinitz’s paper of 1910. They could
only do that at the end of the paper, printed in the next fascicle and published on 15
February 1911.
A holoid domain satisﬁes all the deﬁning conditions of an orthoid domain except
those relating to division. From a holoid domain one can always form an orthoid
domain—its ﬁeld of fractions. The algebraic integers form a holoid domain. The
algebraic integers in a ﬁeld K likewise form a holoid domain, as do subdomains
generated over the rational integers by a ﬁnite set of algebraic integers. Such
domains were called ‘Art’ or ‘Species’ by Kronecker, ‘Ordnung’ by Dedekind, and
‘rings’ or ‘integral domains’ by Hilbert.

23.5
Steinitz
251
After this came several more advanced sections, here omitted. Then, in the
second fascicle they plunged into the theory of modular systems, and in due course
Hilbert’s invariant theory and the ABC Theorem (see Sect. 20.4). Hadamard and
Kürschák showed that Hilbert’s third Theorem (later much better known under the
name Nullstellensatz, see Sect. 25.5) implies Noether’s fundamental theorem (the
AF + BG Theorem). The second fascicle, published on 15 February 1911, is also
of interest because by now the authors had had time to take on board Steinitz’s
Algebraische Theorie der Körper, and it is clear from the clarity of the exposition
and the new generality of expression just why Steinitz’s paper had the foundational
effect that it did.
23.5
Steinitz
Ernst Steinitz’s Algebraische Theorie der Körper (‘The algebraic theory of ﬁelds’)
ﬁrst appeared as an article in Crelle’s Journal für Mathematik in 1910, and was
judged so important that it was reprinted as a book in 1930 with additional material
by Reinhold Baer and Helmut Hasse. It is the article that mathematicians know of if
they know anything of the history of ﬁeld theory, and indeed Baer and Hasse speak
of it as being the starting point for many far-reaching researches in the domain
of algebra and arithmetic. They also called it a milestone in the development of
algebraic science, and an exceptionally clear introduction.
It opens with an introduction in which Steinitz says that his deﬁnition of a ﬁeld
is the same as Weber’s: a system in which elements can be added, subtracted,
multiplied, and divided (only division by zero is excluded), the associative and
commutative laws for addition and multiplication are obeyed, and so is the
distributive law. However, he said, whereas in Weber’s day the purpose was Galois
theory, now the ﬁeld concept itself is taken as central, so the aim of the paper was
to survey all possible ﬁelds.
The approach is to identify the simplest possible ﬁelds and then all their
extensions. The ﬁrst step singles out the prime ﬁelds and the concept of the
characteristic of a ﬁeld. There are simple extensions, when a single element is
adjoined, and these may be algebraic or transcendental. Algebraic extensions are
ﬁnite-dimensional, and form the subject matter of Galois theory. Kronecker had
shown how to avoid working with irrationals by working modulo an irreducible
polynomial, said Steinitz, and he proposed to do so here.
He then noted that matters get more delicate with questions that go one way
over the rationals or perhaps ﬁelds of zero characteristic, and another over ﬁelds of
characteristic p, and he indicated that he would deal with this too. This is perhaps the
most important extension of the theory of ﬁelds in Steinitz’s treatment: a thorough-
going acceptance of the existence of ﬁelds of ﬁnite characteristic and a re-writing of
the theory to include them systematically.

252
23
The Concept of an Abstract Field
If we turn now to the paper or book itself, we see that the ﬁrst chapter deals
with the basic concepts: that of a ﬁeld, an isomorphism, subﬁelds, extension ﬁelds,
adjunction of elements, and integral domains. Steinitz deﬁned a prime ﬁeld as one
that has no subﬁelds, and he proved that every ﬁeld has a unique prime subﬁeld.
This prime subﬁeld is either such that there is a prime number p > 0 such that
px = 0 for every x in the subﬁeld, in which case the characteristic of the ﬁeld is
p, or the only number with this property is 0, in which case the characteristic of the
ﬁeld is 0.
I skip ahead to the discussion of the adjunction of an element. Steinitz, following
Kronecker, preferred to work with the rational functions in a variable x over a
ﬁeld K and congruences modulo a polynomial f (x) of degree n that is irreducible
over the ﬁeld, and he showed that indeed K(x)/(f (x)) is a ﬁeld. It is an algebraic
extension of the ground ﬁeld K of degree n. In this way he adjoined all the roots of
the polynomial.
At the cost of providing an inadequate account of what Steinitz did, one that
omits any discussion of his analysis of separable and inseparable extensions of a
ﬁeld of characteristic p, I turn instead to give a brief look at the additional material
by Baer and Hasse.10 This concerned Galois theory.
They took a ground ﬁeld K and a normal algebraic extension ﬁeld L. A normal
extension was deﬁned by Steinitz as one with the property that an irreducible
polynomial over K either remains irreducible over L or factors completely. They
proved that an intermediate ﬁeld is a normal extension if and only if it is identical
to its conjugates, which is to say that it is mapped to itself by all the elements of the
Galois group.11
They took the subject matter of Galois theory to be how ﬁelds intermediate
between K and L relate to subgroups of the Galois group G of the extension, which
is deﬁned as the automorphisms of L that leave K pointwise ﬁxed.
Given a subgroup H of G, they deﬁned L(H) to be the subﬁeld of L that is ﬁxed
pointwise by the elements of H.
Given an intermediate ﬁeld M, they deﬁned the group G(M) to be the subgroup
of G that ﬁxes M pointwise. The natural questions are then to compare G(L(H))
and H, and to compare L(G(M)) and M. It is straight-forward that
G(L(H)) ⊇H, and L(G(M)) ⊇M,
10An extension is separable if the splitting ﬁeld is generated by a polynomial with distinct roots.
To give an example of an inseparable extension, consider the polynomial y3 −x over the ﬁeld
F3(x), where F3 is the ﬁeld of three elements, and the extension generated by α, a root of this
polynomial. We have y3 −α3 ≡(y −α)3 mod 3, so α is the only root.
11A remark about names: it seems that Klein and his students in the 1880s were the ﬁrst to use
the term Galois group, but they applied it speciﬁcally to the groups P SL(2, p), p = 5, 7, 11 that
derive from a part of Galois’s letter to Chevalier that we have not studied. We shall see in the next
chapter that Weber spoke of Galois groups in his Lehrbuch der Algebra.

23.5
Steinitz
253
so the central question becomes: when are these objects equal in pairs? The answer
they give is that these pairs are equal if and only if L is a ﬁnite extension of K
obtained from a polynomial with simple roots.
It will be noted that while Steinitz in 1910 had moved away from Galois theory
and towards a theory of ﬁelds in their own right, in 1930 his editors moved the
emphasis back to Galois theory.

Chapter 24
Ideal Theory and Algebraic Curves
24.1
Introduction
Polynomials in two variables deﬁne algebraic curves in the plane, and algebraic
curves in the plane generally meet (perhaps in complicated ways) in points. What
is the connection between the geometry and the algebra? More precisely: given two
plane algebraic curves, we can consider the curves that pass through the common
points of the two given curves and ask: Does this force the curve to have an equation
of the form
a(x, y)f (x, y) + b(x, y)g(x, y) = 0,
where the two given curves have equations f (x, y) = 0 and g(x, y) = 0? Notice
that this question is—or can be seen as—a question about membership in the ideal
generated by f (x, y) and g(x, y) in the polynomial ring C[x, y].
In this chapter we shall see how this question was answered, not entirely
successfully, in the late nineteenth century by two mathematicians: Alexander Brill
and Max Noether (the father of the more illustrious Emmy). The generalisation
to more variables was very difﬁcult, and was chieﬂy the achievement of Emanuel
Lasker, who was the World Chess champion at the time, with his theory of primary
ideals. We shall give an example of his fundamental result taken from the English
mathematician F.S. Macaulay’s fundamental work on polynomial rings. With these
results, the basic structural features of polynomial rings were all in place, and
with the equally rich theory of number ﬁelds so too were all the basic features of
commutative algebra.

The Brill–Noether Theorem
In his (1874), Max Noether ﬁrst criticised a number of important papers for
answering the original question (given f and g, when can F be written in the form
F ≡Af + Bg?) by saying that F must vanish at the common zeros of f and g.
He rightly found this altogether too naive. Consider the case where f (x, y) = y
and g(x, y) = x2 −y ; the curves f = 0 and g = 0 have a common point at the
origin and the line h(x, y) = y −x = 0 passes through that point, but it cannot
be written in the required form because no expression of that form can contain the
monomial x.
Noether concentrated on the case where f has a q-fold point and g has an r-fold
point at a common point of intersection, where q ≤r and what Noether meant by
a q-fold point is that, in local coordinates, all the terms of φ of degree less than
(q −1) vanish and at least one term of φ of degree q does not vanish.
His aim was to show that the coefﬁcients of F reﬂect the conditions on the
coefﬁcients on f and g. He argued that because all the terms of f of degree less
than q vanish (there are 1
2q(q +1) such terms) there are 1
2q(q +1) conditions of the
coefﬁcients of F. More conditions on the coefﬁcients of F and A arise in the range
q to r −1 inclusive, and more conditions on the coefﬁcients of F, A and B arise in
the range r to q +r −1, at which stage the number of coefﬁcients in A and B equals
the number of coefﬁcients of F for the ﬁrst time, the analysis can stop, and so the
total number of conditions is 1
2q(q + 1) + (r −q)q + 1
2q(q −1) = qr.
Noether’s argument was therefore a simple case of counting constants. But it
is easy to see that the result as stated is incorrect, as the above example given by
f (x, y) = y and g(x, y) = x2 −y shows. For a polynomial in x and y to be of the
form Af + Bg it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst power
of x vanishes, but in the case at hand we have q = 1 and r = 1 suggesting that it is
enough that the constant term of the polynomial F vanish.
Noether’s argument requires that the intersections are simple, which means that
the curves have no common tangents. He did in fact impose this condition, but
he missed the other condition needed for his theorem to be valid, which is that
the curves are given by homogeneous expressions. To see this, deﬁne g∗to be x2.
Clearly, the polynomial is of the form Af + Bg if and only if it is of the form
Af + Bg∗but Noether’s conclusion is in error for g, and correct for g∗.
In the 1890s the newly-founded German Mathematical Society (the Deutsche
Mathematiker-Vereinigung or DMV) asked various experts to write lengthy reports
on the state of their subject. Brill and Noether were asked to survey the theory of
algebraic functions in ancient and modern times and they wrote a magisterial 457-
page account (Brill and Noether 1894).
The topic of intersections of curves was covered in pp. 347–366. They now
took the fundamental question to be: given homogeneous polynomials f (x1, x2, x3)
and g(x1, x2, x3) with no common factor, what are the necessary and sufﬁcient
conditions on a homogeneous polynomial F(x1, x2, x3) so that F ≡Af + Bg,
where A and B are likewise homogeneous polynomials in x1, x2, x3? Once again,

24.2
The Brill–Noether Theorem
257
their answer was expressed in necessary and sufﬁcient conditions at each of the
common points of the curves deﬁned by the equations f = 0 and g = 0: the terms
of F must agree with the terms of expressions in local coordinates of the form
A′f + B′g up to a certain degree, where A′ and B′ are arbitrary homogeneous
forms of any indeﬁnitely large but ﬁnite degree.
The reason for passing to complex projective space was to be able to take account
of all the points of intersection of the curves. Appendix H gives more detail on
the necessity for the use of homogeneous coordinates and projective space, and an
indication of the subtleties involved.
First of all, Brill and Noether reduced the problem to a binary one by eliminating
x1 from the equations f (x1, x2, x3) = 0 and g(x1, x2, x3) = 0, by using the
resultant R(x2, x3) of f and g. This resultant can be written as R = Cf +Dg, where
C and D are polynomials.1 Brill and Noether assumed that f and g have no common
factor, so R ̸≡0 (and also, for the proof, but not the result, that (x2, x3) = (0, 0) is
not a common point of f = 0 and g = 0). Then F will be such that F ≡Af + Bg
if and only if F is such that the identity FD ≡A1f + BR is satisﬁed, where A1 is
another homogeneous polynomial. They then said (1894, p. 352):
Now evidently, separate conditions arise for this latter identity corresponding to the separate
factors of R, and it immediately follows that the conditions for F can only be such as arise
at the individual intersection points of f = 0 and g = 0.
Therefore the original identity can be satisﬁed if and only if the terms of F agree
with the terms of a development of A′f + B′g – where A′ and B′ are arbitrary
forms of any ﬁxed degree – up to a given, sufﬁciently high degree. For example,
when the curves f = 0 and g = 0 have no multiple tangents, the intersection point
is q-fold for f and r-fold for g, and of qr-fold multiplicity for the curves through
that point (which will happen if the relevant factor of R is of degree only qr) then
the comparison need proceed only as far as dimension q + r −2. In particular, if F
itself has a q + r −1-fold point there, the comparison is established identically.
We see that the original problem was taken to be ﬁrmly geometric, and so the
answer was unproblematically given in terms of an analysis of the intersection
points. There was no suggestion that there might be other than purely local
conditions to check. As we shall see, this assumption is a ﬂaw in the proof that
later workers had to confront.
As for the problem of curves with multiple tangents, Noether himself had
addressed the issue in his (1884), where he appealed to the idea that complicated
singularities can be resolved into simple ones by a particular technique. This was
widely believed, but it is clear from Bliss’s Presidential address to the American
Mathematical Society in 1921 that there was still work to be done on the resolution
of singular points.2
1Resultants are discussed in Appendix I.
2General satisfaction is usually attributed to Walker, see Bliss (1923) and Walker (1950).

Ideal Theory and Algebraic Curves
Netto’s Theorem
In 1885 Netto produced an interesting variant of the Brill–Noether theorem that was
to prove to be a curtain-raiser to Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz of 1893. His argument is
not so difﬁcult to follow and by following it we can see some of the difﬁculties that
only Hilbert was able to overcome.
Netto considered two curves, which we may call C and C1, given respectively by
the polynomial equations f (x, y) = 0 and f1(x, y) = 0 with no common factor that
meet in a ﬁnite number of points, and a curve C′ given by a polynomial equation
F(x, y) = 0 that passes through the intersection points of C and C1. He proved the
theorem that there is an integer r such that
F(x, y)r = f (x, y)g(x, y) + f1(x, y)g1(x, y),
or, in “Kronecker’s convenient way of writing”, as he put it,
F(x, y)r ≡0
(mod f (x, y), f1(x, y)).
Loosely, Netto argued that there is a convenient linear change of variable such
that the result of eliminating say y from the equations f (x, y) = 0 and f1(x, y) = 0
is an equation R1(x) = 0 that has multiple points precisely where the curves C and
C1 have common points and moreover the degree of multiplicity of R1 at such a
point is precisely the degree of the multiplicity of the corresponding multiple point.
Netto also argued that the same is true for the equation R2(y) = 0 obtained by
eliminating x.
More precisely, the equations R1(x) = 0 and R2(y) = 0 have the property that
their solutions give the x and y coordinates of the points where the curves meet, but
the method can produce extraneous factors that must be eliminated by inspection.
The need for the change of variable is to eliminate some of these extraneous factors.
It is purely a consequence of the method for ﬁnding R1(x), and I shall assume it
has been done without introducing (as Netto did) new symbols for the variables (see
also the examples in Appendix I).
24.3
The Failure of the Brill–Noether Theorem to Generalise
Much of the historical importance of the ideas of Brill and Noether lies in how they
were generalised. In the present context the difﬁcult question was how to extend
them to the very different situation in several variables, and this was successfully
tackled by Lasker in Germany and Macaulay in London.
König was the ﬁrst to prove a generalised Noether Theorem (see König 1904,
Chapter VII, § 12). It applied to ideals deﬁned by k polynomials F1, . . . , Fk in k
variables that are what Kronecker had called of the principal class, which means that

24.4
Lasker’s Theory of Primary Ideals
259
the varieties corresponding to the ideals (Fi, . . . , Fk), 1 ≤i ≤k, are of codimension
k −i + 1. In other words, the variety corresponding to F1, . . . , Fk is of dimension 0
(it is a ﬁnite set of points), the variety corresponding to F2, . . . , Fk is of dimension
1, and so on.3
König gave necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a polynomial to belong to
the ideal. It is plainly necessary, he observed, that the polynomial vanishes at the
common zeros of F1, . . . , Fk, but this is not sufﬁcient. In fact, as Hilbert had shown
in his Nullstellensatz, if F vanishes at those points, then some power of it belongs
to the modular system. König replaced Hilbert’s proof, which he found rather
complicated, with a simpler argument using the elimination theory he developed in
his book (an argument that is nonetheless too complicated to include here). König’s
test, like Brill and Noether’s original one, was therefore purely local: membership
of the module was tested for by looking at each point of the corresponding variety.
It was soon observed that König’s theorem fails when the number of functions
deﬁning an ideal exceeds the number of variables—I will give Macaulay’s later
example below. The failure of the Brill-Noether theorem to generalise is part of
the story that involves Emanuel Lasker and his discovery of primary ideals. This is
rather complicated and we can only look at it brieﬂy.
24.4
Lasker’s Theory of Primary Ideals
Emanuel Lasker was a student of Max Noether who also studied under Hilbert.
He became the world chess champion in 1893, at the age of 25, and in 1904 he
emigrated permanently to New York, where he became a regular player at the
Manhattan Chess Club. He defended his title successfully for nearly 27 years, before
eventually surrendering it to José Capablanca, who for many years had been an
opponent of his there. His paper on the primary decomposition theorem is his major
contribution to mathematics.
He submitted this paper (Lasker 1905) to Mathematische Annalen from New
York. In it he treated the theory of polynomials in several variables, which he
regarded as intimately connected to the theory of invariants. In a lengthy historical
introduction, Lasker traced two approaches current in the subject, one due to
Dedekind and Hurwitz and the other to Kronecker, Weber, and König. He also noted
other traditions, such as the geometric one started by Cayley and Salmon, and made
rigorous by Noether, but, he said, Noether’s ideas had had to wait 20 years before
they were developed by Hilbert. Lasker placed his own work in the line of descent
from Dedekind’s ideal theory.
His paper deals with homogeneous polynomials (called forms) in m variables.
They have either arbitrary complex coefﬁcients or integer coefﬁcients, in which case
3In modern terminology, this is the condition that the Fi form a regular sequence. See Eisenbud
(1995).

260
24
Ideal Theory and Algebraic Curves
he called the forms integer forms (ganzzahlig). He deﬁned a ‘module’ to be a set
of polynomials closed under addition and multiplication by forms in the ring of
all forms, and an ‘ideal’ to be a set of integer forms closed under addition and
multiplication by integer forms. This clashes with modern terminology, and I shall
instead use the modern term ‘ideal’ throughout (integer forms will not be discussed).
Lasker’s paper is best remembered for the theorem that every ideal is an
intersection of primary ideals in an essentially unique way. This theorem is the
analogue of the unique factorisation theorem for integers. More precisely, Lasker
deﬁned an ideal P to be prime (1905, p. 50) if p · q ∈P implies either p ∈P or
q ∈P. To deﬁne a primary ideal Q he ﬁrst introduced the idea of the variety (which
he called a Konﬁguration or Mannigfaltigkeit) corresponding to it: this is the set of
points at which all the forms in the ideal vanish. He then said (1905, p. 51) that if P
was a prime ideal of the variety V then the ideal Q is a primary ideal corresponding
to P if its corresponding variety is a subset of V and a · q ∈Q and a /∈P implies
that q ∈Q.
Lasker then stated his principal result (p. 50) as:
Theorem (Lasker’s Theorem VII). Every ideal M is representable in the form
M = Q1 ∩Q2 ∩. . . ∩Qk ∩R
where Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk are primary ideals and R is an ideal whose corresponding
variety contains no points.
In the proof, Lasker made considerable use of Dedekind’s idea of one ideal being
residual to another: the residual ideal of M with respect to N, denoted N : M,
consists of those forms f such that f · F ∈N whenever F ∈M. He supposed that
the variety corresponding to M has as its irreducible components C1, C2, . . . , Cj
and formed the ideal MC1 of all forms F such that the residual ideal M : (F) does
not consist of forms vanishing on all of C1. By deﬁnition, these forms are precisely
those for which there is a form Φ such that F does not vanish on C1 and F.Φ ∈M.
Lasker’s achievement was in showing that the ideal MC1 is primary; it is then taken
as Q1.
Lasker next took the residual ideal of MC1 with respect to M, which he denoted
M′
C1. The forms it contains do not vanish on all of C1. The forms in M belong
both to MC1 and M′
C1 and this opened the way to the primary resolution. Once
all the varieties C1, C2, . . . , Cj had been considered, Lasker was left with an ideal
of the form (M, φ) where φ is a form in (M′
C1, . . . , M′
Cj ) that vanishes on none
of C1, C2, . . . , Cj. By looking at the dimensions of the varieties that arise Lasker
showed that the preceding analysis can be applied to (M, φ) repeatedly until the
process is exhausted and the primary decomposition is obtained.
The components of Lasker’s primary decomposition are not entirely unique.
Macaulay called a primary ideal among the Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk irrelevant if it contains
the intersection Q1 ∩Q2 ∩. . . ∩Qk, and can therefore be omitted. The others,
which he called relevant, divide into ones he called isolated and embedded. A Qj

24.5
Macaulay’s Example
261
is isolated if its corresponding variety is not contained in another relevant variety of
higher dimension; otherwise he called it embedded. The isolated primary ideals are
unique, but the embedded ones are not.
The potential occurrence in the primary decomposition theorem of a primary
ideal R whose corresponding variety is empty marks a major development in the
theoretical understanding of ideals, because it shows immediately that no test for
membership of an ideal deﬁned by a set of functions can be conﬁned a priori to
local membership tests at points on the variety deﬁned by the given functions.
For these to be enough, it must be shown that the variety R does not occur in
the primary decomposition. Retrospectively, this places all discussions of ideal
membership, such as Noether’s AF +BG Theorem in doubt. Prospectively, it invites
consideration of conditions which can ensure that such an ideal R does not arise.
24.5
Macaulay’s Example
The simplest case of an irretrievable failure of Noether’s Theorem is that of a
rational quartic curve in space (see Eisenbud 1995, p. 466). Let [x, y, z, w] be the
coordinates of a point in CP3. Let the curve C be deﬁned as follows:
C =

s4, s3t, st3, t4
: s, t ∈C

.
Suppose that a hyperplane H in CP3, with equation fH = 0, meets the curve at four
points P1, P2, P3, P4. We note that the quadric Q with equation fQ = xw −yz =
0 is the only quadric to contain C, although there are several cubic surfaces, for
example y3 −x2z.
If the Brill–Noether theorem were true, it would say that any quadric through
the four points must have an equation of the form Q + ufH = 0, where u =
0 is a linear expression in x, y, z, w. This is a 4-dimensional family of quadrics.
However, there is a 9-dimensional family of quadrics in projective 3-space, and so a
5-dimensional family through the four points where the curve meets the hyperplane.
So some quadrics through the four points are not of the form required by the putative
Brill and Noether theorem, and the failure of Noether’s Theorem is complete.
For example, if the equation of the hyperplane is taken to be y = z, then the
quadric with equation y(w −x) = 0 passes through the four points
[1, 0, 0, 0] , [0, 0, 0, 1] , [1, 1, 1, 1] , [1, −1, −1, 1] ,
but its equation is not of the form Q + uH = 0. This does not contradict König’s
extension of the Brill–Noether theorem, because the module deﬁning the variety
C = s4, s3t, st3, t4 : s, t ∈C is not of the principal class.

262
24
Ideal Theory and Algebraic Curves
Macaulay gave many signiﬁcant examples in his Tract (1916), among them (see
his §44) the counter-example to the Brill–Noether theorem in higher dimensions
consisting of the smooth rational quartic in CP 3. Its ideal is
I = (xw −yz, y3 −x2z, z3 −yw2, y2w −xz2).
Modulo y −z this ideal is I ′ = 
xw −y2, y 
y2 −x2 , y 
y2 −w2 , y2 (w −x)
,
which is the intersection of (x, y) , (y, w) , (w −x, y −x) , (w −x, y + x) and
(for example) I ′ + (x, y, z, w)3. The function y (w −x) vanishes at the four points
but it is not in I ′; in fact it generates the ideal of the four points. Thus, for the
embedded component one can take any homogeneous ideal containing I ′ and a
power of (x, y, z, w) but not containing y (w −x). The failure of the Brill and
Noether theorem now appears as the presence of an embedded irrelevant component
which is not even unique (although not entirely arbitrary).4
24.6
Prime and Primary Ideals
First, some deﬁnitions. Recall that an ideal J is primary if ab ∈J ⇒a ∈J or bn ∈
J for some positive integer n. If we deﬁne R(J), the radical of J, as
R(J) = {a : an ∈J, for some positive integern},
then it is clear that R(J) is a prime ideal, and we say that R(J) is the prime ideal
associated with J.
It is trivial that a primary ideal is prime. The simplest example of a primary ideal
that is not prime is the ideal J = ⟨x, y2⟩in the ring C[x, y]. Here y2 ∈J but y /∈J.
In fact, this example does more, because the radical of J is R(J) = ⟨x, y⟩, and the
square of this ideal R(J)2 = ⟨x2, xy, y2⟩, and we have
R(J)2 ⊂J ⊂R(J),
with strict inclusions, so J is an example of a primary ideal that is not even a prime
power.
It is more work to show that there are examples of prime power ideals that are
not primary, but one is J = ⟨xy −z2⟩in C[x, y, z]. I omit the proof.

Introduction
Another, related branch of algebra that mingles polynomials with geometry was
called invariant theory. We shall see how this ﬁeld was decisively rewritten by the
young David Hilbert in work that made his name in the international mathematical
community.

Invariant Theory
David Hilbert was born in Königsberg on 23 January, 1862. Königsberg was a
small town in East Prussia, best known for being the home town of the philosopher
Immanuel Kant. As the only boy in the family, Hilbert was sent to school when he
was eight, but he did not thrive there, because the emphasis on ancient languages
and the heavy demands on the use of memory was uncongenial, and he transferred
to another school in his ﬁnal year. In these years there was no clear sign of his later
eminence. Hilbert himself said, however plausibly it is hard to determine, that ‘I did
not particularly concern myself with mathematics at school because I knew that I
would turn to it later’ (Fig. 25.1).
Hilbert then went to the university in Königsberg in 1880. The university was
small, but it had a strong tradition in mathematics that had begun when Jacobi had
introduced the ﬁrst mathematics seminar in a German university there. Physics was
also strong: after Franz Neumann the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff had worked there.
When Hilbert arrived Heinrich Weber held the chair in mathematics at Königsberg,
and when he left in 1883 he was succeeded by Ferdinand Lindemann, a geometer
who had just become famous for his proof that π is transcendental.
Weber was to be a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on Hilbert. As we saw in Chap. 22, he had
broad interests. In 1876 he and Dedekind had published the posthumous edition of
Riemann’s Werke, with its generous selection of unpublished material. This was the
major source of information for the many who came to respond to the challenges
Riemann had left for future generations. In 1882 Weber and Dedekind published
a major paper on the algebra and geometry of algebraic curves, from a novel and
abstract standpoint. Through Weber, Hilbert came into contact for the ﬁrst time
with the strong current in German mathematical life that led back to Gauss. He
took lecture courses from Weber on elliptic functions, number theory, and a seminar
on invariant theory (I shall deﬁne this topic below). His replacement, Lindemann,
also encouraged Hilbert to study invariant theory. Hilbert took little advantage of the
German University system that allowed students to study wherever they wished, and
apart from a term in Heidelberg studying under Lazarus Fuchs he stayed at home.
He never went to the more dynamic University of Berlin; presumably Königsberg
was getting something right.
It was at Königsberg that Hilbert met two people who were to be lifelong
inﬂuences. The ﬁrst of these was Hermann Minkowski, a fellow student who was
2 years younger, but already a term ahead. Minkowski was a prodigy, and in 1883,
when he was 19, he won a prestigious prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences
for answering a question in the theory of numbers.1 Unlike Hilbert, Minkowski
had studied in Berlin for a time, and he introduced Hilbert to the traditions of
mathematics represented by Kronecker, Kummer, and Weierstrass.
1The competition turned into a famous scandal. The English mathematician Henry Smith wrote
to the organisers to point out that he had already published a complete solution to that precise
question some years before. Next it was suggested, entirely falsely, that Minkowski had entered
the competition corruptly, knowing of Smith’s work. Then Smith died. The only way out for the
French was to proclaim Minkowski and Smith joint winners, which they duly did.

25.2
Hilbert
265
In Easter 1884 Adolf Hurwitz, who was only 3 years older than Hilbert, was
appointed to an extraordinary professorship at Königsberg. Hurwitz was a former
doctoral student of Klein, then in Leipzig. Hurwitz inspired Hilbert with the desire
to be a universal mathematician. As he later said to his own ﬁrst doctoral student,
Otto Blumenthal, “Minkowski and I were totally overwhelmed by his knowledge
and we never thought we would ever come that far”.2 Hurwitz introduced Hilbert to
the circle Klein was building around him, and from 1886 to 1892, when Minkowski
was in Bonn, Hilbert went almost daily on mathematical walks with Hurwitz. With
Hurwitz, he said, he rummaged through every corner of mathematics, with Hurwitz
always in the lead.
In February 1885, Hilbert submitted his doctoral thesis on invariant theory, as
suggested by Lindemann. That winter he set off on his student travels: to Leipzig
to meet Klein, and then in March to Paris to meet Camille Jordan and Gaston
Darboux. On his return he became a Privatdozent, a junior position that allowed
him to study for his Habilitation (the necessary and almost sufﬁcient condition to
teach at a German University). Klein opposed Hilbert’s decision to habilitate in
Königsberg, because he wanted to broaden the younger man’s education, but he
failed, and Hilbert completed the process quickly and successfully, but with a thesis
topic that was not propitious for his later work. Hilbert was now ensconced at the
university of his choice (his beloved Königsberg) with Hurwitz as a colleague. Later
Hilbert called these years in Königsberg as a time of slow ripening, but at the time
he knew that staying there was not sufﬁciently stimulating, and in Easter 1888 he
set of on his travels again, going this time to Göttingen (where Klein now was) and
then, at Klein’s suggestion, to Erlangen, to talk with Paul Gordan.3
Gordan was a former colleague of Klein’s. He was sometimes referred to as
the King of invariant theory for showing, in 1868, that the ring of invariants and
covariants of any binary form is ﬁnitely generated as a ring (I will deﬁne these
terms shortly). His proof was heavily computational and explicit, for Gordan was
a master at manipulating long algebraic expressions, and no one had been able
to make signiﬁcant progress on the case of three variables. But Gordan’s method
allowed a mathematician to produce for each degree d a basis for the invariants
of binary forms of degree d such that every invariant of that degree is a sum of
products of powers of these invariants. Furthermore, it provided a similar basis for
the covariants of every degree. Computationally the method became too bulky for
forms of degree higher than 6, but in principle it was both general and explicit.
Hilbert and Gordan spent a good week together in Leipzig in the spring of 1888,
after which Hilbert elatedly reported to Klein:
With the stimulating help of Professor Gordan, meanwhile, an inﬁnite series of brain-waves
has occurred to me. In particular we believe I have a masterful, short, and to-the-point proof
of the ﬁniteness of complete systems for homogeneous polynomials in two variables. (Frei
1985, p. 39)
2See (Blumenthal 1935, p. 390).
3This account follows (McLarty 2012).

266
25
Invariant Theory
Hilbert now came alive as a mathematician, and remarkably quickly established the
ﬁniteness for any system of invariants for forms of arbitrary degree in any number
of variables, but by methods that were not constructive. They were general existence
theorems, and, as Hilbert was to discover, they have an air of the miraculous about
them that some mathematicians ﬁnd hard to accept.
Hilbert placed the question “is there a ﬁnite basis for these objects?” in an
abstract context, and showed that there must be a basis by little more than using
induction on the number of variables involved. The whole proof barely lasts two
pages. As he commented in a letter to Klein when he sent one of his ﬁrst notes
describing his work for publication, “I have restricted the use of formulae as far as
possible, and only presented the intellectual content in a crisp manner”.
Gordan initially balked at the lack of explicit results, apparently saying: “This
is not mathematics, it is theology”, and Hilbert himself admitted that his method
gave no means of ﬁnding the basis, no indication of its size, and no impression
of what the elements of the basis might look like. Indeed, as we shall see below,
Hilbert’s ﬁrst published proof had errors. Although Gordan later conceded that even
theology has its uses, Hilbert felt the shortcomings of his conceptual approach rather
keenly, and in the late 1880s he began to remedy the problem, moving the subject
on dramatically, and by 1897, as he observed in his lectures “We can nevertheless
not be satisﬁed with merely knowing the number of invariants, as it is even more
important to also know about the in- and covariants themselves, and about the
relations between them”. In 1888 Hilbert published the proofs of his discoveries
in the Mathematische Annalen, at the time edited by Klein. Not for the last time the
fortunes of these very different men, Hilbert and Klein, rose together.
Gordan’s approach was by no means that of someone defending an out-of-date
viewpoint against a better idea. He refereed Hilbert’s fuller version of the invariant
theorem for the Mathematische Annalen and wrote:
Sadly I must say I am very unsatisﬁed with it. The claims are indeed quite important
and correct, so my criticism does not point at them. Rather it relates to the proof of the
fundamental theorem which does not measure up to the most modest demands one makes
of a mathematical proof. It is not enough that the author make the matter clear to himself.
One demands that he build a proof following secure rules . . . . Hilbert disdains to lay out
his thoughts by formal rules; he thinks it is enough if no one can contradict his proof, and
then all is in order. He teaches no one anything that way. I can only learn what is made as
clear to me as one times one is one. I told him in Leipzig that his reasoning did not tell me
anything. He maintained that the importance and correctness of his theorems was enough.
It may be so for the initial discovery, but not for a detailed article in the Annalen. (Hilbert
and Klein 1985, p. 65)
Naturally, Hilbert was annoyed by this report and complained to Klein about it.
Klein accepted the paper which became (Hilbert 1890) and replied:
Gordan has spent 8 days here . . . . I have to tell you his thinking about your work is quite
different from what might appear from the letter reported to me. His overall judgment is
so entirely favorable that you could not wish for better. Granted he recommends more
organized presentation with short paragraphs following one another so that each within
itself brings some smaller problem to a full conclusion. (Hilbert and Klein 1985, p. 66)

Invariants and Covariants
The objects of study are forms: homogeneous polynomials in n variables, and
how they transform under invertible linear transformations in the variables. The
canonical example is the binary quadratic form ax2 + bxy + cy2, which transforms
under a linear transformation of the variables into, say, a′x2 + b′xy + c′y2. In this
setting we have b′2 −4a′c′ = (b2 −4ac)δ2, where δ is the determinant of the linear
transformation, and so b2 −4ac is called an invariant of the binary quadratic form.
More generally, the invariants of a form are expressions in the coefﬁcients of the
form that are altered by a linear transformation in the variables only by a multiple
of the determinant of the transformation. There are also the covariants of the form;
these are expressions in the coefﬁcients and the variables of the form that are altered
by a linear transformation in the variables only by a multiple of the determinant of
the transformation.
The invariants of a system of forms in n variables form a ring. Gordan’s major
result was that the ring of invariants of binary forms of any ﬁxed degree is ﬁnitely
generated. For example, the ring of invariants and covariants of a binary cubic form
f is generated by the unique invariant, d, of a cubic form and its three covariants,
f , H, and J, which satisfy an identity (called by Sylvester and after him by Hilbert
a syzygy): 4H 3 = df 2 −j2. Unfortunately it would take us too far aﬁeld to deﬁne
these – an indication of the complexity of the work. But, as Hilbert showed in his
Lectures, d and H have this signiﬁcance: the condition that the cubic have three
distinct roots is that d ̸= 0, and among cubics with repeated roots two are distinct if
and only if d = 0, H ̸= 0, and all three roots are repeated if and only if d = 0 = H.
25.4
From Hilbert’s Paper on Invariant Theory (1890)
Theorem I. If any non-terminating sequence of forms in the n variables
x1, x2, . . . , xn is given, say F1, F2, F3, . . ., there is a number m such that each
form in any sequence can be put in the form
F = A1F1 + A2F2 + · · · + AmFm,
where A1, A2, . . . Am are suitable forms in the given n variables.
[...]
In the simplest case n = 1 every form in the given sequence consists of a single
term of the form cxr, where c is a constant. Let c1xr1 be the ﬁrst term in the given
sequence for which the coefﬁcient c1 is different from zero. We now seek the ﬁrst
subsequent form whose order is less than r1; let this form be c2xr2. Then once again
we seek the ﬁrst subsequent form whose order is less than r2; this form shall be

268

c3xr3. Proceeding in this way we obtain at the latest in r1 steps4 a form Fm in the
given series after which no form has a lower order, and every form in the sequence
is divisible by Fm, so m is a number having the property speciﬁed by our Theorem.
[Hilbert then reviewed previous attempts on Theorem I., observed their growing
complexity as the number of variables increased, and suggested a new approach by
induction on n.]
Let F1, F2, F3, . . . be the given sequence of forms in the n variables
x1, x2, . . . , xn and F1 a form of order r that does not vanish identically. We ﬁrst
determine a linear substitution in the variables x1, x2, . . . , xn that has a non-
zero determinant and also converts the form F1 into a form G1 in the variables
y1, y2, . . . , yn so that the coefﬁcient of yr
n in the form G1 takes a non-zero value.
By means of this linear substitution the forms F1, F2, . . . are converted respectively
into G1, G2, . . .. If we now consider a relation of the form
Gs = B1G1 + B2G2 + · · · + BmGm,
where s denotes an arbitrary index and B1, B2, . . . , Bm are forms in the variables
y1, y2, . . . , yn, then under the inverse linear transformation this itself goes into a
relation of the form
Fs = A1F1 + A2F2 + · · · + AmFm,
where A1, A2, . . . Am are forms in the original variables x1, x2, . . . , xn. Therefore
our Theorem I. for the originally given sequence of forms F1, F2, F3, . . . follows as
soon as the proof for the sequence of forms G1, G2, G3, . . . is obtained.
Since the coefﬁcient of yr
n in the form G1 has a non-zero value, the degree of
each form Gs in the given sequence with respect to the variable yn can be reduced
below r, so one can multiply G1 by a suitable form Bs and subtract the resulting
product from Gs. Accordingly, for the arbitrary index s we set
Gs = BsG1 + gs1yr−1
n
+ gs2yr−2
n
+ · · · + gsr,
where Bs
is a form in the n variables y1, y2, . . . , yn, while the forms
gs1, gs2, . . . , gsr contain only the n −1 variables y1, y2, . . . , yn−1.
We now assume that our Theorem I. has already been proved for forms in n −1
variables, and apply it to the sequence of forms g11, g21, g31, . . .. It follows from
Theorem I. that there is a number μ such that for every value of s there is a relation
of the form
gs1 = bs1g11 + bs2g21 + · · · + bsμgμ1 = ls(g11, g21, . . . , gμ1),
4This claim is odd: there is no terminating algorithm for ﬁnding the lowest power of x, although it
is clearly ≤r1.

where bs1, bs2, . . . , bsμ are forms in the n −1 variables y1, y2, . . . , yn−1. We now
construct the form
g(1)
st = gst −ls(g11, g21, . . . , gμ1), (t = 1, 2, . . . , r)
(25.1)
where in particular for t = 1
g(1)
s1 = 0.
We now apply Theorem I. again, in the case of n −1 variables, to the sequence of
forms
g(1)
12 , g(1)
22 , g(1)
32 , . . . .
It follows from Theorem I. that there is a number μ(1) such that for every value of s
there is a relation of the form

s2 = b(1)

where b(1)
s1 , b(1)
s2 , . . . + b(1)
sμ(1) are forms in the n −1 variables y1, y2, . . . , yn−1.
We now set

st = g(1)
st −l(1)
s (g(1)

μ(1)t), (t = 1, 2, . . ., r)
(25.2)
where in particular for t = 1, 2
g(2)
s1 = 0, g(2)
s2 = 0.
The application of Theorem I. to the sequence of forms g(2)
13 , g(2)
23 , g(2)
33 , . . . leads
to the relation
g(2)
s3 = l(2)
s (g(2)
13 , g(2)

μ(2)3),
and we set
g(3)
st = g(2)
st −l(2)
s (g(2)
1t , g(2)
2t , . . . , g(2)
μ(2)t), (t = 1, 2, . . ., r)
(25.3)
from which it follows in particular that
g(3)
s1 = 0, g(3)
s2 = 0, g(3)
s3 = 0.

(25.4) by linear combinations of the forms g1t, g2t, . . . , gmt, where m denotes the
largest of the numbers μ, μ(1), . . . , μ(r−1). In this way we obtain from the last
formula a system of equations of the form
gst = cs1g1t + cs2g2t + · · · + csmgmt = ks(g1t, g2t, . . . , gmt), (t = 1, 2, . . . , r).
If we multiply the last formula by yr−t
n
and these equations for t = 1, 2, . . . , r,
it follows, because
gs1 = yr−1
n

that the equation
Gs −BsG1 = ks(G1 −B1G1, G2 −B2G1, . . . , Gm −BmG1)
holds, or, if Cs denotes a form in the n variables y1, y2, . . . , yn, that
Gs = CsG1 + ks(G1, G2, . . . , Gm) = Ls(G1, G2, . . . , Gm),

271
i.e. the number m is such that Theorem I. holds for the sequence of forms G1, G2,
G3, . . . and consequently also for the original sequence of forms F1, F2, F3, . . ..
Consequently our Theorem I. holds in the case of n variables on the assumption that
it is proved for forms in n −1 variables. Since our Theorem I. is already known to
be valid for forms in a single homogeneous variable, it holds in general.
Commentary
The proof of the Hilbert basis theorem is largely a matter of devising a good
notation. The strategy is proof by induction, so we assume that the theorem is true
for n variables, which we call x1, x2, . . . , xn, and we now have homogeneous forms
in the n+1 variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, y. Forms involving the xs and y will be written
in capital letters, forms that do not involve the variable y in lower case. A form of
degree d will be written as F (d) or f (d) if we need to indicate its degree, d.
We shall assume that, possibly after a change of variable, the ﬁrst form in the
sequence looks like
G(d)
1
= yd + C1,
where C1 is a polynomial in y of degree at most d −1 with coefﬁcients that
are polynomials in the xs. Hilbert put the form G1 into his generating set for the
sequence (Gs).
Consider the form G(k)
s . If there is no power of y of degree d or more, we leave
it alone. If
G(k)
s
= csyr + Ds,
where r > d is the highest power of y that occurs in Gs, and c is a form in the xs,
then we reduce the degree of y in the term csyr. To do so, we use the equation
G(d)
1
= yd + C1
to write
G(k)
s
= csyr−dyd + Ds = csyr−d(G(d)
1
−C1) + Ds =
csyr−dG(d)
1
−csC1yr−d + Ds.
We have written Gs in terms of G1 and terms that are of degree at most r −1 in y,
because C1 and Ds are polynomials in y of degree at most d −1. Notice that the
coefﬁcient of G1 in the new expression for Gs involves both xs and y.

272
25
Invariant Theory
By repeating this reduction as often as necessary, we write each form in this
manner:
G(k)
s
= BsG1 + bs1yr−1 + bs2yr−2 + · · · + bsr.
Hilbert now looked at the column of coefﬁcients of yr−1:
b21, b31, . . . , bs1, . . . .
By his inductive hypothesis, there is an integer k1 such that every entry in this
column is a linear expression (with coefﬁcients that are polynomials in the xs) of
b21, b31, . . . , bsk1.
Hilbert now put the corresponding G2, G3, . . . , Gsk into his generating set.
Consider now a Gt with t > sk. By subtracting suitable combinations of the
generators, here denoted Ht, it can be written as
Gt −Ht = b′
t2yr−2 + b′
t3yr−3 −. . . ,
and the same argument as before allows Hilbert to deal with the columns of b′
t2. He
added the necessary Gt −Ht to his generating set, and moved on to the next column
in the same way, until all the columns were taken care of.
25.5
The Hilbert Basis Theorem and the Nullstellensatz
Hilbert’s Theorem I. evolved into the Hilbert basis theorem, which says that any
ideal in a polynomial ring has a ﬁnite basis, but this evolution was a complicated
process that we cannot fully trace here. But we can see that the original formulation
is rather different, and its proof in some respects inadequate. First of all, Hilbert
worked with homogeneous polynomials, and they do not form a ring (the sum of
two homogeneous expressions of different degrees is not homogeneous). McLarty
in his (2012) speculates plausibly that Hilbert simply thought that one could drop
the homogeneity requirement, but, as the editors of Hilbert’s Werke note, this is not
the case unless the forms satisfy some particular requirements. This is the error that
marred his initial publications.
Second, Hilbert stated his theorem only for polynomial rings; how generally he
thought it applied is a complicated historical matter. Third, and more importantly,
Hilbert spoke of a countable sequence while plainly dealing with uncountable sets
of forms, and then appealed to a procedure that even in the countable case is not
algorithmic: there is no way of being sure one has found the expression of least
degree of a given kind. But this, too, has a historical dimension. Gordan had no
problem with these claims, and made similar ones himself. But Gordan did have

25.5
The Hilbert Basis Theorem and the Nullstellensatz
273
ideas about how to express polynomials in ways that make Hilbert’s procedure
constructive if we grant that the expression of least degree can be found, and
this was a contribution Hilbert adopted when he tried to make his approach more
explicit. That said, even modern computers have not enabled mathematicians to deal
effectively with forms of degree 5 or more.
In 1893 Hilbert returned to the theory of forms, and proved what he called
his third general theorem, and which has become known as the Nullstellensatz or
theorem on the places of the zeros (Hilbert 1893, pp. 320–325).
In the form he presented it, it says: Given m rational integral homogeneous
functions5 f1, f2, . . . , fm of n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, and let F, F ′, F
′′, . . . be any
rational integral homogeneous functions of the same variables x1, x2, . . . , xn with
the property that they all vanish for those systems of variables for which the given m
functions f1, f2, . . . , fm, then it is always possible to determine an integer r such
that every product (r) of r arbitrary functions from the sequence F, F ′, F
′′, . . .
can be written in the form
(r)

= a1f1 + a2f2 + · · · + amfm,
where the a1, a2, . . . am are suitable rational integral homogeneous functions in the
variables x1, x2, . . . , xn.
We can give only a sketch of the proof. Hilbert derived it in two steps, on the
further assumption that the sequence F, F ′, F
′′, . . . is ﬁnite. First, he assumed that
the m forms f1, f2, . . . , fm have only a ﬁnite number of common zeros. In this
setting he argued by induction on the number of common zeros. The theorem is
true when the forms have no common zero. To carry out the inductive step, Hilbert
introduced a way of regarding the forms as forms in two variables (binary forms)
and used the well-developed theory of binary forms to prove the theorem in that
setting.
Second, to obtain the general proof, Hilbert argued by induction on the number
of variables. The induction can begin with two variables.
The theorem entails, as he remarked, a result obtained earlier by Netto for
inhomogeneous functions of two variables, that the rth power of any member of
the sequence F, F ′, F
′′, . . . belongs to the module (f1, f2, . . . , fm).
5That is, homogeneous polynomials.

Chapter 26
Hilbert’s Zahlbericht
26.1
Introduction
Historians often note that two books in number theory open and close the nineteenth
century in the theory of numbers: Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae at the start
of the nineteenth century and Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, or Report on the Theory of
Numbers, at the end. Here we look at aspects of Hilbert’s book, and hint at some
of its inﬂuential choices, including its inﬂuence on the subsequent study of algebra.
26.2
An Overview of the Zahlbericht
In 1893 the DMV asked Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski to report on the theory of
numbers. Minkowski was by then established as a world authority on the subject,
but his friend Hilbert was known for his work on invariant theory and had done little
more than express interest in number theory.
Hilbert was turning towards a subject that had become something of a German
speciality and a source of pride within the ﬁeld of mathematics ever since Gauss had
published his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in 1801. As we have seen, the subjects
of quadratic forms, quadratic reciprocity and its generalization to higher powers,
and cyclotomy took off with Gauss’s work, and what sustained the interest of
researchers was what Gauss had noted: the surprising difﬁculty in providing proofs,
and the unexpected connections between topics that the search for proofs was
likely to reveal. The cumulative production of such mathematicians as Eisenstein,
Jacobi, Dirichlet, Dedekind, Kummer, and Kronecker was a daunting prospect and
a challenge for the ambitious mathematician.

Hilbert’s Zahlbericht
Minkowski, however, soon withdrew from the project because he felt he was too
busy with other things, especially his book Geometrie der Zahlen (The Geometry
of Numbers). As a result, Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, for all its 371 pages, is only a
torso. A number of topics in number theory with a pedigree going back to Euler and
Jacobi are under-represented,which may well have skewed the subsequent impact of
Hilbert’s problems on number theory. But Minkowski kept in touch with Hilbert, and
performed the useful service of checking all the page proofs. Minkowski’s opinion
of the Zahlbericht was high. He wrote to Hilbert:
I congratulate you now that ﬁnally the time has come, after the many years of labour, when
your report will become the common property of all mathematicians, and I do not doubt that
in the near future you yourself will be counted among the great classical ﬁgures of number
theory.
He predicted correctly. Aside from the depth of insight Hilbert brought to the
subject, and his careful organisation, the Zahlbericht is lucidly written. Hermann
Weyl, one of the great writers of mathematics in German or English, regarded the
preface to Hilbert’s Zahlbericht as one of the great prose works in mathematical
literature, and described in his obituary of Hilbert how as a young man he had heard
“the sweet ﬂute of the Pied Piper that Hilbert was, seducing so many rats to follow
him into the deep river of mathematics”. Hilbert also re-presented the history of
number theory in a way that appealed to its practitioners, making it clear how it
had emerged as a systematic science only during the past hundred years or so. More
precisely, he re-wrote the subject so that knowledge of its history and familiarity
with the older texts was no longer required. New readers could start here.
This fresh start partly came about from Hilbert’s whole-hearted introduction of
the ideas of Galois theory, which formed the second of the ﬁve parts of the Report.1
Hilbert thought of Galois theory as a theory of algebraic numbers and therefore
as an organising principle in algebraic number theory. This not only gave a clear
conceptual shape to the subject, it explained why questions in number theory led
naturally to and from questions about cyclotomy. The Zahlbericht is a paradigm
example of the beneﬁts of digging deep in pursuit of an explanation, and it put the
seal on a century of stretching the deﬁnition of an integer until the general concept
of an algebraic integer was paramount, and the ordinary integers had to travel with
a qualifying adjective ‘rational’.
Hilbert was particularly fond of analogies, which he hoped would suggest deep,
if at times obscure, connections. He noted that a number of problems in number
theory relied on complex function theory, and that there were numerous points in
which the theory of algebraic functions and ﬁelds of algebraic numbers overlapped.
1An enthusiasm for Galois’s work that he surely acquired from Klein, and which became a strongly
held view in Göttingen that was shared by Hermann Weyl in the next generation.

Ideal Classes and Quadratic Number Fields

(This had been the central thrust of paper by Dedekind and Weber in 1882.) As he
put it in the preface (p. ix):
Thus we see how far arithmetic, the Queen of mathematics, has conquered broad areas of
algebra and function theory and has become their leader. The reason that this did not happen
sooner and has not yet developed more extensively seems to me to lie in this, that number
theory has only in recent years become known in its maturity . . . . Nowadays the erratic
progress characteristic of the earliest stages of development of a subject has been replaced
by steady and continuous progress through the systematic construction of the theory of
algebraic number ﬁelds.
The conclusion, if I am not mistaken, is that above all the modern development of pure
mathematics takes place under the banner of number: the deﬁnitions given by Dedekind and
Kronecker of the concept of number lead to an arithmetisation of function theory and serve
to realise the principle that, even in function theory, a fact can be regarded as proven only
when in the last instance it has been reduced to relations between rational integers. [. . . ] The
arithmeticization of geometry fulﬁls itself in the modern study of Non-Euclidean geometry,
which it provides with a rigorous logical structure and gives the most direct possible and
completely objection-free introduction of number into geometry
Hilbert’s breakthrough with invariant theory had been achieved by adopting a
strongly conceptual approach that minimised, but did not disdain, the computational
side, and he now advocated taking the same approach in number theory:
the ﬁfth part develops the theory of those ﬁelds [the cyclotomic ﬁelds] which Kummer took
as a basis for his researches into higher reciprocity laws and which on this account I have
named after him. It is clear that the theory of these Kummer ﬁelds represents the highest
peak attained today on the mountain of our knowledge of arithmetic; from it we look out
on the wide panorama of the whole explored domain since almost all essential ideas and
concepts of ﬁeld theory, at least in a special setting, ﬁnd an application in the proof of the
higher reciprocity laws. I have tried to avoid Kummer’s elaborate computational machinery,
so that here, too, Riemann’s principle may be realised and the proofs carried out not by
calculations but purely by thought.
26.3
Ideal Classes and Quadratic Number Fields
As Lemmermeyer and Schappacher note in their introduction to the English
translation of Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, Hilbert did not use, and I would add did not
possess, the modern way of thinking about algebraic number theory. He spoke
of ‘number rings’, following Dedekind—meaning the ring of integers in a given
number ﬁeld—but did not think there was a subject called ring theory. More
surprisingly, but in line with what he had learned from Weber, for someone who
valued Galois theory so highly, he did not develop any tools from abstract group
theory. In particular the notion of a quotient group is lacking in the Zahlbericht and
so Hilbert was forced into some clumsy locutions. This says a lot about the state of
abstract algebra in 1893–97.
That said, Hilbert was very happy to work with ideals in a given number ring,
just as Dedekind had advocated. He deﬁned two ideals a and b to be equivalent,
written a ∼b, if and only if there are algebraic integers α and β in the ring such

278
26
Hilbert’s Zahlbericht
that βa = αb. The equivalence class of all ideals equivalent to a given one he called
an ideal class, and he showed that this notion of equivalence respects products: if
a ∼a′ and b ∼b′, then ab ∼a′b′. All principal ideals are equivalent, they form the
so-called principal class, which I shall denote e, and ea = a.
There is a notion of quotient ideal: the ideal b is divisible by the ideal a if there
is an ideal c such that b = ac. Hilbert showed that division, like multiplication,
extends to ideal classes. He then showed, following Minkowski, and before him
Dedekind and Kronecker, that the number of ideal classes is ﬁnite. The number of
distinct ideal classes is called the class number of the ﬁeld and its ring of integers.
Signiﬁcantly, he did not say that the set of ideal classes has just been shown to
form a ﬁnite abelian group, and so he could not appeal to any theory of such things.2
He did note that if the class number is h then the hth power of every ideal is the ideal
e, which is trivial if one thinks of groups.
I have chosen to illustrate these general ideas with a selection of items from
the third part of Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, which is on quadratic ﬁelds. Hilbert began
by recalling that in the ﬁeld Q(√m) obtained by adjoining √m to Q, where the
positive square root is taken when m > 0 and the positive imaginary square root is
taken when m < 0, has as its basis {1, ω}, where
ω = 1 + √m
2
, or ω = √m,
according as m is congruent to 1 mod 4 or not.
The discriminant is d = m in the ﬁrst case and d = 4m in all the others.
The discriminant is given as (ω −ω′)2.
How do prime ideals in Q fare in Q(√m)? Hilbert, following Dedekind, showed
that the following happens:
•
every rational prime that divides d is a square in Q(√m);
•
every odd rational prime that does not divide d splits into two conjugate primes
in Q(√m) if and only if d is a quadratic residue mod p;
•
every odd rational prime that does not divide d remains prime in Q(√m) if and
only if d is a quadratic non-residue mod p;
•
when m ≡1 (mod 4) the prime 2 splits into two conjugate primes in Q(√m) if
m ≡1 (mod 8) and remains prime if m ≡5 (mod 8).
At this stage, Hilbert merely observed that it was now possible to exhibit all the
ideal classes for any value of m, which is true but unenlightening. He could have
investigated the group structure, as later mathematicians were to do, but he once
again failed to draw maximum proﬁt from the fact that the ideal classes form a ﬁnite
abelian group—which may only serve to remind us that the history of mathematics,
like the history of anything, is seldom tidy.
2Commutativity and associativity for ideals and ideal classes follows from commutativity and
associativity in the ring itself.

Glimpses of the Inﬂuences of the Zahlbericht

Instead, and very importantly for later developments, Hilbert developed a theory
of quadratic extensions of the Gaussian integers Z[i], which he called Dirichlet’s
biquadratic ﬁeld, with a view to raising it “in a purely arithmetic way to the same
level that the theory of quadratic ﬁelds has since Gauss” in (Lemmermeyer 2007,
pp. 528–529). To this end he computed the integral bases of the ideals and the
decomposition into prime ideals. He then deﬁned the genus of an ideal in terms of
their characters—it would take us too far to give the deﬁnitions, but an interesting
point can be made nonetheless. Hilbert put ideals in the same class in the same
genus, and called the principal class that genus all of whose classes are trivial. He
then stated the ‘principal genus theorem’ that every ideal in the principal genus is
the square of some ideal class. To quote (Lemmermeyer 2007, p. 539):
Hilbert then determines the number of genera, derives the quadratic reciprocity law, and
ﬁnally gives an arithmetic proof of the class number formula for Q(i, √m) and m ∈Z.
In the third section of the Zahlbericht Hilbert reworked this material, deduced the
quadratic reciprocity law in this setting, and proved the ‘principal genus theorem’.
More precisely, Hilbert showed that in a quadratic number ﬁeld Q(
√
d) there
are precisely 2t−1 different genera, where t is the number of prime divisors of
d, the square of any proper ideal class lies in the principal genus, and conversely
every proper ideal class in the principal genus is the square of a proper ideal class.3
The signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst remark is that it shows that precisely half the possible
number of genera occur.
It is striking how closely this progression of ideas resembles Gauss’s original
path, transcribed from forms to ideals.4
26.4
Glimpses of the Inﬂuences of the Zahlbericht
Two books may serve to illustrate the state of algebraic number theory in the period
shortly after Hilbert’s Zahlbericht: Legh Wilber Reid’s The Elements of the Theory
of Algebraic Numbers (1910) and J. Sommer’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie
(or, Lectures on Number Theory) (1907), which was also published in a French
translation in 1911.
Reid, who was a professor at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, set himself the
task of preparing people to study more advanced works, such as the Zahlbericht. He
carefully introduced the key terms: integers, algebraic integers, and realms (his term
for a ﬁeld). He then studied the rational realm (which he denoted k), congruences
among rational integers, and quadratic residues, and proved the theorem of quadratic
reciprocity using Gauss’s lemma. Then came several chapters of examples: the
3See (Frei 1979, p. 41).
4As (Lemmermeyer 2007, p. 541) observes, Weber’s approach to the genus theory of ideals in
quadratic ﬁelds in his Lehrbuch der Algebra (Sect. 22.4 above) follows Hilbert’s closely.

280

Hilbert’s Zahlbericht
realm k(i), the realm k(
√
−3), the realm k(
√
2), and then the realm k(
√
−5), which
allowed him to introduce the concept of ideals. He then considered the “general
quadratic realm” k(√m) and its ideals, congruences modulo an ideal in these realms,
units, and ideal classes.
His book could almost be read as an introduction to Sommer’s, which is also
billed as an introduction to contemporary number theory. It begins with a lengthy
chapter on the general quadratic ﬁeld and moves on to apply the theory to Fermat’s
last theorem and the relationship of the multiplication theory of ideals to the
composition of forms. The book then concludes with a chapter on cubic ﬁelds and
one on relative ﬁelds, topics that we cannot introduce here, and there is an appendix
on the geometric theory of lattices that reﬂects the inﬂuence of Klein.
Both books make valuable contributions to their mathematical communities.
Both start off much as Dirichlet had done in his Lectures, and then move into
topics from Dedekind’s various supplements. In view of the greater sophistication
among his audience that Sommer felt he could assume, it is interesting to quote the
introductory remarks that Hilbert contributed to Reid’s book.
The theory of numbers is a magniﬁcent structure, created and developed by men who
belong among the most brilliant investigators in the domain of the mathematical sciences:
Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, Gauss, Jacobi, Dirichlet, Hermite, Kummer, Dedekind
and Kronecker. All these men have expressed their high opinion respecting the theory of
numbers in the most enthusiastic words and up to the present there is indeed no science so
highly praised by its devotees as is the theory of numbers. In the theory of numbers, we value
the simplicity of its foundations, the exactness of its conceptions and the purity of its truths;
we extol it as the pattern for the other sciences, as the deepest, the inexhaustible source of
all mathematical knowledge, prodigal of incitements to investigation in other departments
of mathematics, such as algebra, the theory of functions, analysis and geometry.
Moreover, the theory of numbers is independent of the change of fashion and in it we do
not see, as is often the case in other departments of knowledge, a conception or method at
one time given undue prominence, at another suffering undeserved neglect; in the theory
of numbers the oldest problem is often to-day modern, like a genuine work of art from the
past. Nevertheless it is true now as formerly, a fact which Gauss and Dirichlet lamented, that
only a small number of mathematicians busy themselves deeply with the theory of numbers
and attain to a full enjoyment of its beauty. Especially outside of Germany and among the
younger mathematicians arithmetical knowledge is little disseminated. Every devotee of
the theory of numbers will desire that it shall be equally a possession of all nations and be
cultivated and spread abroad, especially among the younger generation to whom the future
belongs. Such is the aim of this book. May it reach this goal, not only by helping to make the
elements of the theory of numbers the common property of all mathematicians, but also by
serving as an introduction to the original works to which reference is made, and by inciting
to independent activity in the ﬁeld of the theory of numbers. On account of the devoted
absorption of the author in the theory of numbers and the comprehensive understanding
with which he has penetrated into its nature, we may rely upon the fulﬁlment of this wish.
Rhetoric, of course, but an indication of how Hilbert saw the importance of the
subject he had done so much to redeﬁne, and of the tradition that he was seeking to
establish and extend.

Chapter 27
The Rise of Modern Algebra:
Group Theory
27.1
Introduction
Here we look at how group theory also emerged “in its own right” in various books
and papers around 1900, including the ﬁrst monograph on abstract group theory, and
then look at the inﬂuential work of the American mathematician Leonard Eugene
Dickson.
27.2
The Emergence of Group Theory as an Independent
Branch of Algebra
It makes sense for a modern mathematician to ask “What is group theory?” He or
she, if a beginner, might simply want to know, and would presumably receive the
answer that begins “A group is a set with a closed binary operation satisfying the
following axioms: ...”. Or the mathematician might be asking for an answer such as
“Group theory is that branch of mathematics that deals with symmetry”, or, if that’s
too vague, for an answer that indicates what role group theory plays, or is intended
to play, in mathematics as a whole.
The historian of modern mathematics wants to know when mathematicians began
asking such questions, and why. When was there a recognisable body of ideas
that could be singled out and characterised, assessed for its importance, promoted,
extended and otherwise used? There is usually no tidy answer to such a question,
because it is about a social process of creation and recognition. Perhaps there
is a moment when some deﬁnitive account was given, after which there was an
identiﬁable subject—group theory—and people could say “I am a group theorist”,
“Today I proved a theorem in group theory”. Usually there is a preceding period
lasting quite some time when the subject was building, often in a subordinate but
growing role within some other enquiry. It’s quite common then for it to turn out

The Rise of Modern Algebra: Group Theory
that the subject has ‘really’, ‘implicitly’, ‘tacitly’ been around all along. In the case
of group theory it has seriously been argued that Egyptian and later Islamic designs
show an awareness of group theory, but that should not distract us from investigating
when group theory emerged from the study of the solution of polynomial equations,
and what happened as a result.
The ﬁrst person to try to axiomatise the group concept was Cayley in 1849,
responding to Cauchy’s papers of a few years before, and Cayley may be the ﬁrst
person to use the term in its modern sense as applying to some symbols that obey
the rules for multiplication and division. It is, however, unclear whether Cayley
regarded his ‘symbols of operation’ as transformations, in which case he need not
have said they obeyed the associative law, or if they are abstract, in which case he
should couched his remarks about associative as an axiom and not as mere fact.
In any case, historians of mathematics seem agreed that Cayley’s ideas had little
impact, perhaps because he did little with them to indicate the merit in and power
of thinking group-theoretically.1
A more effective presentation of axioms for commutative groups is due to
Kronecker in 1870, which he gave in his work as a number theorist. But matters
changed signiﬁcantly in the late 1870s. In those years Cayley raised the idea of
studying groups for their own sakes, and called for an answer to the question of
ﬁnding all groups of a given order. This is an absurdly difﬁcult question, so much
so that I doubt if Cayley had any idea how hard it was, but it is to his credit that he
asked it at all, and it indicates that a subject called group theory had arrived (or at
least was arriving). The paper also had an inﬂuence: Otto Hölder cited it speciﬁcally
when writing his paper on groups of orders p3, pq2, pqr, p4 in 1893.
Kronecker’s ideas about commutative groups also had an impact in Berlin where
they were picked up by Frobenius and Stickelberger. Frobenius was to mature into
the most important Berlin mathematician of his generation; Stickelberger was more
of a specialist. Together they hacked out a classiﬁcation of ﬁnite abelian groups from
its hidden place in the work of number theorists such as Gauss.
According to Wussing (1984, III.4), whose account we have been following, the
year 1882 saw several crucial changes in the recognition of the importance of group
theory within algebra. In that year Weber published a paper (1882) about prime
numbers represented by quadratic forms in which he gave what may be the ﬁrst
proper deﬁnition of a group of order h. It is a system G of h elements, ϑ1, ϑ2, . . . ϑh
with a composition or multiplication such any two elements can be combined to
make a third: ϑrϑ2 = ϑt, where
(ϑrϑs)ϑt = ϑr(ϑsϑt),
1For a thorough study of deﬁnitions of a group and discussions in the early years of the twentieth
century about the best deﬁnition, see (Hollings 2017).

27.2
Emergence
283
and such that from either
ϑϑr = ϑϑs
or from
ϑrϑ = ϑsϑ
it follows that ϑr = ϑs.
From these assumptions Weber deduced that there is a unique element ϑ0 in the
system such that for every element ϑr
ϑrϑ0 = ϑ0ϑr = ϑr.
Furthermore, for every ϑ in G there is a unique ϑ′ such that
ϑϑ′ = ϑ′ϑ = ϑ0.
He added that the group is Abelian if for every pair of elements ϑr and ϑs it is the
case that ϑrϑs = ϑsϑr.
Also in 1882 Eugen Netto published his book Substitutionstheorie und ihre
Anwendung an die Algebra (Substitution theory and its applications in algebra)
and Walther von Dyck, a pupil of Klein’s published his paper Gruppentheoretische
Studien I (Group-theoretic studies)—paper II followed the next year.
Netto’s book is divided into two parts. The ﬁrst develops group theory in the
manner of Jordan’s Traité with attention to the number of values of function may
take, and, in Chap. 7, an interest in groups of various orders (p, pq, p2). The second
part applies this to the solution of algebraic equations, with chapters on cyclotomy,
abelian equations, and algebraically solvable equations. In short, although Netto did
not use the term, Galois theory. In the preface Netto acknowledged the importance
of the books of Serret and Jordan and thanked his revered Professor Kronecker,
regretting only that Kronecker’s Grundzüge had been published too recently to have
been any use in the preparation of this book.
His main claim to originality, said Netto of himself, was his recognition that
the group formation, by its generality, has many advantages and this generality is
clearest if the presentation is abstract. So although he called his book ‘substitution
theory’ and not ‘group theory’, and tended to think of his groups as permutation
groups, he did present ﬁnite commutative groups axiomatically (see p. 144, where
he followed Kronecker’s presentation). However, like his mentor, neither man saw
any reason to develop group theory outside of a context where it could immediately
be applied.
Netto’s book was translated into English in 1892 and reviewed by Bolza the next
year. His comments were divided between praise for the account of substitution
groups in the ﬁrst half of the book, and criticisms of the account of the Galois theory
of equations (as we discussed in Sect. 15.2).
Von Dyck went much further. In his papers he included transformation groups
in geometry and inﬁnite groups generally in the range of objects he studied. He
had learned from Klein how groups appeared in geometry, both projective and non-
Euclidean geometry, and he tended to think of them as transformation groups with

284
27
The Rise of Modern Algebra: Group Theory
the transformations left out, as it were, and just the rules for combining the group
elements left behind. So he can be read as offering the idea of a group as a free
group on a certain number of generators which, perhaps, are then subject to some
relations. It is indeed possible to argue that the combinatorial study of groups via
their generators and relations represents a different way of thinking about groups to
the axiomatic one, the approach via transformations and geometry, and the approach
rooted in permutation groups.
The ﬁrst person to act on the idea that groups are best thought about abstractly
was Frobenius, who decided to rework the theory of ﬁnite groups without recourse
to permutation-theoretic ideas. He recognised that every ﬁnite group is a subgroup
of a permutation group (a result ﬁrst proved by Cayley) and that Sylow’s theorems
are true (Sylow had proved them in 1872), but he re-derived them abstractly in a
paper of 1887.
In 1889 Hölder published his proof of what has become known as the Jordan–
Hölder theorem. He also proceeded entirely abstractly in his treatment of groups.
Hölder’s contribution differs from Jordan’s contribution to the Jordan–Hölder
theorem in that he proved that in an unreﬁnable composition series—a chain of
maximal ‘normal’ subgroups, each one ‘normal’ in the one before—
G = G0 ▷G1 ▷· · · ▷Gj ▷Gj+1 ▷· · · ▷Gn = {e},
it is not just the orders of the quotients
|Gj |
|Gj+1| that are independent of the choices
made at each stage (about which maximal normal subgroup to pick) but the quotient
groups themselves.
‘The Group as a Fundamental Concept of Algebra’ is a section heading in
Wussing’s book, and it is a good topic with which to conclude this section. Wussing
ﬁnds that the role groups were made to play in Weber’s investigations of Galois
theory and algebraic number theory was decisive. In four lengthy papers collectively
called Theorie der Abel’schen Zahlkörper (Theory of Abelian number ﬁelds) 1886–
1887, Weber, relying on the paper by Frobenius and Stickelberger, showed how to
use group theory in the study of algebraic number theory, and in a further paper
of 1893 he advocated that groups be treated purely formally so that their theory
can be applied indifferently to Galois theory and number theory, a view he repeated
in the second volume of his Lehrbuch. That said, Weber otherwise showed little
inclination to move beyond the permutation-theoretic presentation of groups; he
recognised there was a general concept but in his hands it remained subordinate to
other topics. This may be one reason why, as Wussing notes, the study of abstract
groups for their own sake did not get going until the twentieth century. We should,
however, add that in Volume 2 of his Lehrbuch der Algebra Weber repeated his
earlier axioms for a ﬁnite group and then carefully noted that when inﬁnite groups
are involved one must also assume that every element has an inverse. This makes
him the ﬁrst person to give an abstract deﬁnition of an inﬁnite group.

27.2
Emergence
285
Wussing also noted that the ﬁrst monograph to present group theory abstractly
was de Séguier’s Théorie des Groupes Finis: Éléments de la Théorie des Groupes
Abstraits (1904), and it is indeed abstract. Whereas many earlier books and papers
presented groups in speciﬁc settings—as groups of permutations or groups of
geometric transformations—and were not altogether clear about the axioms that
deﬁned a group, de Séguier began with the idea that a group is at the very least a
set of objects.2 Moreover, he discussed what properties of sets (with reference to
Cantor’s (1895)) and what maps between sets are.
A group then emerges as a set with a product: the product of elements of the
group is again an element of the group, and (Postulate 1) the product is associative,
(ab)c = a(bc). Furthermore (Postulate 2), the equation ax = b always has a
solution for every pair of elements a and b, as does the equation xa = b (Postulate
3). De Séguier then deduced that there is a unique element u such that ua = a = au
for all elements a in the group. As a result, every element a has an inverse a−1 such
that aa−1 = u. He then remarked that the three postulates are satisﬁed by numerous
examples, so they are not self-contradictory, and they are independent, as is shown
by various non-standard deﬁnitions of the product operation.
De Séguier then worked his way through a considerable amount of what was
known in the emerging ﬁeld of group theory. He wrote about subgroups or divisors
and invariant or normal subgroups, and in some detail about the connection to Galois
theory. From normal subgroups he passed to quotient groups, which he called factor
groups, and their relation to homomorphisms between groups. He discussed Sylow’s
theorems and solvable groups, the structure of abelian groups, groups of prime
power order, and several other topics.
Abstraction and the axiomatic presentation of various domains of mathematics
were topical at the start of the twentieth century, promoted by the inﬂuence of
Hilbert’s Grundlagen der Geometrie (1899) and a growing feeling that one could
get lost in studies that were too detailed. It offered both a consolidation of what
had been discovered, and an opportunity to make new discoveries undistracted by
accidental features coming from the origins of the subject. A group need not be seen
as a permutation group, nor should a ﬁeld necessarily belong to Galois theory. De
Séguier’s monograph may not have reshaped group theory, but it a marker that the
subject had become autonomous, needing neither techniques nor motivation from
other ﬁelds, pertinent though they may be.
There are several ways in which the history of an ongoing subject can bid farewell
to its subject. In the present case, we can note the arrival of representation theory,
speciﬁcally character theory, in the work of Frobenius and Burnside, and point to
Burnside’s paqb theorem: all groups of order paqb are solvable, where p and q are
primes. In his introduction to Burnside’s Collected Papers the group-theorist Walter
Feit said that “I would guess that the elegance of both the statement and the proof
have attracted more people to the study of characters than any other result in the
2(Hollings 2017) concentrates on American postulation theorists such as Huntington and Moore,
whom de Séguier cited.

286

subject”. Put it together with Sylow’s theorems, which show that groups of order
pa are solvable, and we have the result that the order of a nonabelian ﬁnite simple
group must be divisible by at least three primes—as is the case for A5, which is of
order 60 = 22 · 3 · 5.
27.3
Dickson’s Classiﬁcation of Finite Simple Groups
We can also note the publication of Dickson’s Linear Groups with an Exposition of
the Galois Field Theory, 1901. This is a study of matrix groups over ﬁnite ﬁelds, it
having been recently shown that every ﬁnite ﬁeld is of order pn for some prime p
(see Sect. 23.2)—these are what Dickson called Galois ﬁelds. Dickson’s preface to
his book may speak for itself, eloquent as it is not only about the amount of work
that had by then been done on this relatively new branch of mathematics, but on
how the theory is organised.
Since the appearance in 1870 of the great work of Camille Jordan on substitutions and their
applications, there have been many important additions to the theory of ﬁnite groups. The
books of Netto, Weber and Burnside have brought up to date the theory of abstract and
substitution groups. On the analytic side, the theory of linear groups has received much
attention in view of their frequent occurrence in mathematical problems both of theory
and of application. The theory of collineation groups will be treated in a forthcoming
volume by Loewy. There remains the subject of linear groups in a ﬁnite ﬁeld (including
linear congruence groups) having immediate application in many problems of geometry and
function-theory and furnishing a natural method for the investigation of extensive classes
of important groups. The present volume is intended as an introduction to this subject.
While the exposition is restricted to groups in a ﬁnite ﬁeld (endliche Körper), the method
of investigation is applicable to groups in an inﬁnite ﬁeld; corresponding theorems for
continuous and collineation groups may often be enunciated without modiﬁcation of the
text.
The earlier chapters of the text are devoted to an elementary exposition of the theory of
Galois ﬁelds chieﬂy in their abstract form. The conception of an abstract ﬁeld is introduced
by means of the simplest example, that of the classes of residues with respect to a prime
modulus. For any prime number p and positive integer n, there exists one and but one Galois
ﬁeld of order pn. In view of the theorem of Moore that every ﬁnite ﬁeld may be represented
as a Galois ﬁeld, our investigations acquire complete generality when we take as basis the
general Galois ﬁeld. It was found to be impracticable to attempt to indicate the sources of the
individual theorems and conceptions of the theory. Aside from the independent discovery
of theorems by different writers and a general lack of reference to earlier papers, the later
writers have given wide generalizations of the results of earlier investigators. It will sufﬁce
to give the following list of references on Galois ﬁelds and higher irreducible congruences:

The second part of the book is intended to give an elementary exposition of the more
important results concerning linear groups in a Galois ﬁeld. The linear groups investigated
by Galois, Jordan and Serret were deﬁned for the ﬁeld of integers taken modulo p; the
general Galois ﬁeld enters only incidentally in their investigations. The linear fractional
group in a general Galois ﬁeld was partially investigated by Mathieu, and exhaustively
by Moore, Burnside and Wiman. The work of Moore ﬁrst emphasized the importance of
employing in group problems the general Galois ﬁeld in place of the special ﬁeld of integers,
the results being almost as simple and the investigations no more complicated. In this way
the systems of linear groups studied by Jordan have all be [sic] generalized by the author
and in the investigation of new systems the Galois ﬁeld has been employed ab initio.
The method of presentation employed in the text often differs greatly from that of the
original papers; the new proofs are believed to be much simpler than the old. For example,
the structure of all linear homogeneous groups on six or fewer indices which are deﬁned
by a quadratic invariant is determined by setting up their isomorphism with groups of
known structure. Then the structure of the corresponding groups on m indices, m < 6,
follows without the difﬁcult calculations of the published investigations. In view of the
importance thus placed upon the isomorphisms holding between various linear groups, the
theory of the compounds of a linear group has been developed at length and applied to
the question of isomorphisms. Again, it was found practicable to treat together the two
(generalized) hypoabelian groups. The identity from the group standpoint of the problem of
the trisection of the periods of a hyperelliptic function of four periods and the problem of
the determination of the 27 straight lines on a general cubic surface is developed in Chapter
XIV by an analysis involving far less calculation than the proof by Jordan.
Chicago, November, 1900.
When the book was reprinted in 1958, the group-theorist and geometer Wilhelm
Magnus added a short introduction, in which he praised the book as “a milestone
in the development of modern algebra.” The Jordan–Hölder Theorem, he went on,
posed a fundamental problem in the theory of groups of ﬁnite order: Find all the
simple groups, especially the non-trivial simple groups whose order is not a prime
number. The way forward, Magnus suggested, had been through the study of ﬁnite
ﬁelds (or as they were called later, Galois ﬁelds) and here Dickson’s book had been
especially useful. It was still, he said, the most extensive and thorough presentation
of the theory of Galois ﬁelds available in the literature, and “Although many of
his proofs would be shortened today, and although the same subject would be
expounded differently now, the ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of Dickson’s book are still very
readable, and contain an enormous wealth of both examples and theorems”.
Magnus then went on to describe how Dickson, building on the work of such
predecessors as Lie, Cartan, Killing, and Engel, had shown in two further papers
that—the Mathieu and alternating groups aside—all the known simple groups lie in
one of eight inﬁnite systems that arise naturally from the analysis of linear groups
with coefﬁcients in a Galois ﬁeld. He then added
It is a remarkable fact that after these two papers of Dickson’s appeared no new simple
groups of ﬁnite order were discovered for half a century. It was not until 1955 that a paper
by C. Chevalley appeared presenting a new inﬁnite system of ﬁnite simple groups. In this
same paper Chevalley also announced that he had been able to obtain simple linear groups

288

in a Galois ﬁeld which are the analogue of the exceptional simple continuous groups not
considered by Dickson.
Magnus also remarked that “I would only add that in addition to the remarkable
enumeration of simple groups Dickson’s book testiﬁes to the geometric signiﬁcance
of many of these groups; I suspect that some good original historical work can be
done on the geometry of ﬁnite groups”.

Emmy Noether
28.1
Introduction
Emmy Noether is universally regarded as the greatest woman mathematician so far.
Here we look at some of her work in the creation of modern algebra (Fig. 28.1).
Emmy Noether’s life is reasonably well known, although there are good reasons
for thinking that her mathematical contributions have not been properly understood
by historians. She was born on 23 March 1882 in Erlangen in Germany, where
her father Max Noether was Professor of Mathematics. She studied mathematics
herself, taking a PhD under her father’s friend Paul Gordan in 1907. The topic was
computational invariant theory, in which Gordan was still the world expert, and
which had been transformed by the more recent work of Hilbert.
In 1916 she was in Göttingen, where it was also easier to be, because the First
World War was devastating the ranks of students and junior members of staff. She
was there when Einstein came to discuss difﬁculties in formulating the general
theory of relativity, a topic that was also of great interest to Hilbert at the time, who
had a rival theory. Einstein’s visit attracted the attention of Klein, and he turned to
Emmy to clarify what a theory of conserved quantities and conservation laws might
be in general relativity. She did this by re-writing conservation laws as symmetries,
so conservation of momentum is a symmetry of the group of translational isometries,
conservation of angular momentum a symmetry of the rotation group, and so on.
After the war Hilbert secured her a position, albeit unpaid, after facing down
the opposition from members of the Philosophy Faculty, to which the Mathematics
Department belonged, with the immortal words “We are not running a bath house”.1
Emmy Noether’s attention shifted to abstract algebra, and by the end of the 1920s
she had drawn a group of almost equally gifted young mathematicians around her,
Emil Artin and Bartel van der Waerden among them, jocularly called the Noether
boys. It is they who turned her way of thinking into ‘Modern Algebra’, while she
did fundamental work on commutative and non-commutative algebra.
In 1933 the Nazis came to power in Germany, and set about barring Jews from
the civil service and the universities. Emmy Noether was a Jew, and one with well-
known left-wing sympathies,2 but she was able to get a position at the women’s
university Bryn Mawr, in Pennsylvania, USA. She died there on 14 April 1935 from
a post-operative infection.
Because of the three parts of her career there are, one might say, three Emmy
Noethers known to history. There is the invariant theory one, and because she
affected to despise her PhD work and because invariant theory is very technical,
this Noether is often dismissed as a false start. But Colin McLarty is busy giving
this part of her career a through examination and showing how deeply it was tied in
to contemporary mathematics and how signiﬁcant its implications were for Emmy
Noether’s later work, so this part of her reputation may well change in the next few
years.
1She eventually obtained a modest salary.
2As was her brother Fritz, a physicist, who left for the Soviet Union where he was eventually
murdered in the purges of the 1930s.

Introduction

Then there is the Noether who turned physicists away from conservation laws
and towards symmetries and symmetry groups.3 This Noether is well-known to
physicists who, however, do not always know the ﬁrst and third ones. In fairness,
many mathematicians do not know the second Noether.
Then there is the third Noether, the one presented here. Even this one is perhaps
misunderstood. I shall give the traditional version, in which Noether’s work on
commutative rings is described, and her later work on non-commutative rings and
number theory is barely hinted at. But McLarty has been arguing that Noether found
maps between objects just as important, thus giving her work a category-theoretic
spin.
And indeed there is a fourth Noether, Noether the great woman mathematician.
There may yet be a ﬁfth, because McLarty has been arguing for some time that
too much has been taken over from the reminiscences and obituaries of two
mathematicians who knew her well: the Soviet mathematician and topologist Pavel
Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl, who many regard as Hilbert’s true successor. They
down-played her politics, and he has been arguing that it interestingly of a piece
with her mathematics. For another integrative account of Emmy Noether’s life and
work, see (Koreuber 2015).
Inﬂuences
I have indicated that the inﬂuence of her father and of Paul Gordan on the
young Emmy Noether is being re-examined. There can be no doubt that Hilbert’s
work on invariant theory and later number theory inﬂuenced her, because he was
the dominant algebraist of his time. We should also note that the ﬁrst abstract
presentation of a ring was given in (Fraenkel 1914), which was based on the author’s
doctoral dissertation. The paper deliberately resembles Steinitz’s account of ﬁelds,
but, as its title indicates the paper is more concerned with the factorisation of zero
divisors than the abstract properties of a ring per se. In it a ring is deﬁned as what
we would call a not necessarily commutative ring with a multiplicative unit.4
But the person she always singled out as the thinker it was worth coming back
to was Dedekind: “Es steht alles schon bei Dedekind” (“Everything is already
in Dedekind”) she would say. There is a clear sense in which this is true. She
worked on algebra, on rings and ideals in particular, leaning more to number
theory than algebraic geometry, and very obviously chose Dedekind’s approach over
Kronecker’s. But this should not blind us to a deeper commonality. Like Dedekind
she looked hard for the right concepts around which to organise a theory. She wanted
to know what was the deep part of an analogy that would take work forward, what
concepts should guide the calculations. This is evident in one her most famous
papers, to which we now turn.
3For this Noether, in an account written by someone who does know all three Noethers, see
(Kosman-Schwarzbach 2011).
4Fraenkel added two further deﬁnitions to assist him in obtaining factorisation theorems; see (Corry
1996, p. 210).

28.2
Ideal Theory in Ring Domains
Emmy Noether began her paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Ideal theory in ring
domains) by saying that it carried over of the factorisation theorem for rational
integers and ideals in algebraic number ﬁelds to arbitrary integral domains and more
general ring domains.5
She recalled the decomposition of an integer into products of prime powers,
a = pe1
1 pe2
2 . . . pess = q1q2 . . . qs, qj = p
ej
j , j = 1, . . . s,
and noted four facts about the prime powers, which she called the components of
the decomposition:
1. No two have a common divisor, and no q is a product of numbers with no
common divisor, so they are irreducible in that sense;
2. Any two components, qj and qk say, are relatively prime; that is, if qk divides
bqj then b is divisible by qk;
3. Every qj is primary; that is if a product bc is divisible by some q then either b is
divisible by q or some power of c is;
4. Every q is irreducible in the sense that it is not representable as the least common
multiple of two proper divisors.
(We shall comment on her language below.)
She went on to remark that when the factorisation theorem for rational integers
is stated in terms of primary factors it says that any primary decomposition has the
same number of components, the same primes, and the same exponents. Formulated
in terms of ideals one can even drop the remark about the ambiguous sign.
She now proposed to generalise this theorem to rings all of whose ideals have
ﬁnite bases. This condition ensures that there are irreducible and prime ideals, which
are lacking, she observed, in the ring of all algebraic integers, where there is no
factorisation into prime ideals.
She proposed to show that the four facts mentioned above generalise to four
versions of factorisation theory. The ﬁrst fact leads to the idea of factorisation
into divisor-free irreducible ideals, the remaining three generalise the idea of least
common multiple. The ﬁrst two (of the four) lead to a unique factorisation theorem,
the third and fourth must allow for some components called isolated ideals.
Noether regarded the ring of polynomials in n variables with complex coefﬁ-
cients as the simplest ring that admitted all four versions. The theory of factorisation
of these polynomial domains into maximal primary ideals had, she said, been
worked out by Lasker and reﬁned by Macaulay. But here the theory of irreducible
ideals and relatively prime irreducible ideals still remained to be studied, although
Macaulay had ventured some remarks on when the isolated primary components are

unique. The theory of divisor-free irreducible ideals had been studied by Schmeidler,
who had used the existence of a ﬁnite basis for these ideals. Here Noether promised
a signiﬁcant generalisation and consequent simpliﬁcation of the theory.
In §1 of her paper Noether deﬁned a ring R as a system of elements that one
can add and multiply, and subtract, that obeys the associative and commutative laws
for addition, the associative law for multiplication and the commutative law for
multiplication, and the distributive law. She noted that she did not require that there
be a multiplicative unit, and she did not exclude zero divisors.6 A ring with no zero
divisors was, she said, called an integral domain.
She deﬁned an ideal I as a subset closed under subtraction and multiplication by
arbitrary elements of the ring: a, b ∈I ⇒a −b ∈I; a ∈I, r ∈R ⇒ar ∈I. She
said an ideal J is divisible by an ideal I if J was a subset of I. This makes sense:
in the ring Z the ideal (6) is divisible by the ideal (3) because, indeed, the integer
6 is divisible by the integer 3. Be warned: the ideal doing the dividing is the bigger
ideal!
She restricted her attention to those rings for which every ideal has a ﬁnite basis,
and observed that if I, I1, I2, . . . is a chain of ideals each of which is divisible by the
next one—notice that this gives us an ascending chain of ideals—then the chain is
ﬁnite: there is an integer n such that j ≥n ⇒Ij = In. She also noted the converse:
if every ascending chain of ideals is ﬁnite then every ideal has a ﬁnite basis.7
The extent to which her paper reworks Lasker’s gradually becomes clear. In §2 of
her paper Noether showed that every ideal can be represented as the least common
multiple (lcm) of ﬁnitely many irreducible ideals. She deﬁned the lcm of the ideals
I1, . . . , Im as the set of elements common to all ideals, that is, as their intersection

j Ij. (So, just as divisors get bigger, multiples get smaller!) She observed that one
can always assume that when an ideal is presented as an lcm it is the lcm of ideals
none of which divide any of the others.
Now she set about obtaining a decomposition of an ideal into irreducibles. She
deﬁned an ideal to be irreducible if it cannot be presented as the lcm of two other
ideals (other than trivially, when the ideals are the same). Then she proved that
every ideal is an lcm of ﬁnitely many irreducible ideals. When this is done by
successive division (i.e., successive intersection) that reduces the ideal every time,
the decomposition is said to be the shortest. In §3 she showed that the number of
components in two such decompositions is always the same provided they are as
short as possible—I gloss over this point.
In §4 Noether came to primary ideals. An ideal I is primary if ab ∈I, a /∈I ⇒
bn ∈I for some integer n. If the integer n = 1 in every case the ideal is said to be
prime. The signiﬁcant theorem here is this one:
If Q is a primary ideal there is a unique prime ideal P that is a divisor of Q and
such that Q is a divisor of some power of P. This is easier to understand in the
6A ring R has zero divisors a, b ∈R if a ̸= 0, b ̸= 0, ab = 0.
7As Corry points out (1996, p. 239), Noether’s use of the ascending chain condition is much more
explicit and central in her paper (1926), which unfortunately I cannot consider here.

language of subsets: we have P ⊇Q ⊇P n for some integer n. Recall that P ⊇
P 2 ⊇. . . P n ⊇. . ., but note that there need be no value of the integer n such that
Q = P n.
Noether showed that irreducible ideals are primary. Moreover, two shortest
representations of an ideal as an lcm of irreducible ideals give rise to the same
primary ideals.
In §5 she showed that when an ideal is represented as the lcm of maximal primary
ideals the number of components and the number of primary ideals are unique.
The paper continued, but I shall leave it here, noting that she studied the
decomposition into relatively prime irreducible ideals, the possible uniqueness of
the so-called isolated components (which I have not yet deﬁned), and quite a bit
more. Nor, indeed, was this Noether’s only paper on the subject, but it is perhaps
enough for present purposes.
28.3
Structural Thinking
One way to measure Emmy Noether’s achievements in abstract algebra is simply
to pick up any advanced undergraduate or graduate text book in the subject.
Mathematicians simply do ring theory her way. They may stipulate that a ring has
a multiplicative unit, but that’s the only change they make. That is why rings that
satisfy an ascending chain condition are called Noetherian rings, in her honour. They
form a large class of rings that very neatly and naturally captures what is happening
in the rings of interest in number theory and algebraic geometry. Of course much
has happened since 1935, but homological algebra, category theory, and even non-
commutative algebra grow out of her work – they do not replace it or diminish it.
It is a rare thing to redeﬁne a ﬁeld so completely. It means that two or three
generations of mathematicians have found the topic of rings important and her way
of formulating the theory helpful. A detailed study of how this came about would
take us too far aﬁeld, but one aspect can be singled out. It is known as the structural
approach.
To over-simplify, Emmy Noether directed attention to a class of rings large
enough to include most of the interesting known examples, and she provided a way
of thinking about them which seldom said anything about properties, still less the
forms, of typical elements. Everything was kept at the level of subsets. She was
explicit about this, and people liked the simpliﬁcations and clarity it brought to the
subject. Arguably, it created the subject of abstract (commutative, Noetherian) rings.
One way to see that this is an over-simpliﬁcation is to see that it over-estimates
the set-theoretic way of thinking. If you look back at her work she did not talk
about subsets, but divisors, not about intersections but least common multiples. She
could have done, the language had been available since the time of Cantor, and
Krull, another ‘Noether boy’, was to introduce it, but she kept it because the links
to number theory were important to her. Her work on non-commutative algebra and
number theory, which is much harder, demonstrates her priorities.

28.3
Structural Thinking
295
Nonetheless, her work eclipsed a whole school of computational algebraists
for as much as two generations. She had a high opinion of the work of Lasker
and Macaulay, with its heavy use of explicit polynomials and the methods of
elimination theory (resultants, resolvents, ...) but the Noether boys did not; that
kind of mathematics became deeply unfashionable and people who worked in the
area felt unfairly neglected. Modern computing has restored the computational side
somewhat, but no-one would deny that the conceptual framework of modern algebra
was laid down by Noether.
It is worth concluding by observing that neither she, nor Dedekind before
her, nor Hilbert, took up abstract mathematics before they felt they had to. The
ideas of modern abstract algebra did not fall from the sky, they did not seduce
mathematicians away from good honest work. They grew from the ground, and
they accomplish things. Nowhere is this clearer than in the very concept of a ring.
The ring of integers is the paradigm mathematical object; formulating geometry
and number theory in the language of rings is currently a massive mathematical
operation, and Noether’s work is a turning point in that endeavour.

Chapter 29
From Weber to van der Waerden
29.1
Introduction
This section is a commentary on the opening chapter of Corry’s Modern algebra
and the rise of mathematical structures, and more particularly his paper ‘From
Algebra (1895) to Moderne Algebra (1930): Changing Conceptions of a Discipline.
A Guided Tour Using the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik’, in (Gray
and Parshall (eds.) 2006, pp. 221–243).1
The story that Corry traces through the pages of the abstracting and reviewing
journal of the time start with the books of Serret, Jordan, and especially Weber on
algebra, and ends with the book that gave modern algebra its name: van der Waer-
den’s Moderne Algebra (ﬁrst edition 1930). Corry calls van der Waerden’s approach
‘structural’: his book presents groups, ideals, rings, and ﬁelds (as many a textbook
has done since). Various other objects are relegated to the status of mere examples
(the rational and the real numbers, for example). The once fundamental theorem of
algebra ceases to be fundamental. Key concepts are introduced axiomatically.
This gets particularly interesting when Corry points to texts written between
Weber’s and van der Waerden’s: one by Dickson, one by Hasse (both major number
theorists) one by the by-then elderly Fricke and another by Otto Haupt. These books
offer much the same selection of topics (what Corry, following Elkana, calls the
body of knowledge) but in a way that reﬂects old-fashioned priorities (the image of
the knowledge, Corry’s term for the things one says about mathematics).
To trace the evolution of the body and the change in the image, Corry uses the
Jahrbuch, both for the wealth of information it contains and because its structure
(division into major topics and sub-topics) displays a shifting image of mathematics.
So he contrasts Weber’s major paper of 1893 on Galois theory with his three-volume
Lehrbuch der Algebra to show that Weber had a more modern image in that paper

From Weber to van der Waerden
than he chose to give the subject in his textbook. Corry next shows that while group
theory was a recognised part of algebra by 1900, it was presented as a technique
subordinate to the study of substitutions and determinants, and Galois theory is part
of the theory of equations. At this stage the classiﬁcations of the Jahrbuch are close
to those that Weber used in his textbook. Algebra has at its core the solution of
polynomial equations in one or several variables.
Quaternions and vector analysis make their appearance in a new classiﬁcation
scheme in 1905. The background here is an international investigation into the
merit of vectors and vector methods in teaching and research (and a resolution
of a controversy as to the related role of quaternions). More importantly for us,
what is called ‘universal algebra’ appears, which was the name for such things as
Wedderburn’s investigations of what we call ‘algebras’. But another major paper,
Lasker’s on modular systems, was forced into the section on the theory of forms—
not wrong, exactly, but not comfortable.
Corry moves on to note that Steinitz’s paper on the abstract theory of ﬁelds,
which was published in 1910 and is seminal in its importance for the subject and
for structural algebra generally, did not even make it to the algebra pages of the
Jahrbuch but appeared under the rubric of ‘Function Theory: General’. Indeed, he
pointed out that, strange though this is, the paper could hardly have gone anywhere
else at the time.
I pass over Corry’s discussion of a different classiﬁcation used by American
mathematicians at the time, which largely conﬁrms his analysis, and come to the
next major change in the Jahrbuch, the one in 1916. For the ﬁrst time, group theory
and the abstract theory of ﬁelds and modules has a place of its of own, and the
theory of rings was reviewed in due course in this section. But Galois theory was
still conﬁned within the theory of equations; only in 1925 did group theory ﬁnally
make it to algebra.
Finally, what of van der Waerden’s Moderne Algebra? It was reviewed under
the heading of Algebra and Arithmetic, which was appropriate, alongside Hasse’s
essay on modern algebraic methods and the re-edition of Steinitz’s monograph on
the abstract theory of ﬁelds.
From Gauss and Galois to van der Waerden
Does Corry’s account of the slow, undirected but concept-driven emergence of
modern algebra from what might be called the Weberian view extend backwards?
Does it offer a good way of looking at developments from, say, the 1830s to the
1890s? I shall leave this as an issue for you to address, but some methodological
lessons can be drawn from his paper.
Corry’s analysis reminds us that many signiﬁcant changes happen only slowly, or
force themselves on everyone’s attention only after a long period under the surface.
There are many reasons why this might be, or have been, the case.
One is inertia: there are many papers in the sections of the Jahrbuch relevant
to the emergence of modern algebra that are not discussed because they did not
promote the changes we (and Corry) are interested in. These papers are of varying
merit: they may all have new things to say but not all of them have equal claims

on everyone’s attention. Many of them do not contest the body or the image of
algebra at the time they were written. The mathematicians who wrote them have
to be brought along, and their contributions fairly reﬂected in the Jahrbuch. If one
supposes that the leading mathematicians of the day teach the new material and
the new approaches, it will take time for their weaker but nonetheless productive
students to start writing the papers that will, in their turn, be conventional for their
day. Indeed, in 1900 quite a few authors were professional engineers or school
teachers but only avocational mathematicians; it is seldom the case that these people
write a truly original paper (Macaulay was one such).
Another, perhaps more signiﬁcant, reason might be called complexity, or the
emergence of a need for a division of labour. There will often be major mathemati-
cians who do not share what historians later ﬁnd to be an emerging orthodoxy. There
is a curious shift at work here. What, after all, should one say is the major purpose
of mathematics? A perfectly good answer is that it solves problems. Consider the
analogy with work in science. Even a hazy acquaintance with modern science shows
that quite massive and complicated machinery is needed to make the discoveries
(the genome project, the large hadron collider, ...) and consequently there is a
large collection of people whose job it is to understand this or that aspect of the
machinery—not the genome or hadrons, particularly. So is the real job of the
mathematician to solve equations, a task that, to be sure, would involve group theory.
Or is it to build a ‘machine’, such as group theory, remembering that an application
might be to the solution of polynomial equations?
This is a perfectly responsible question of the kind that every mathematician
designing a syllabus or planning the course of their own career has to confront.
There may well be no unique answer. Historians of mathematics can observe that
different answers are given at different times for different reasons. For example, van
der Waerden wrote his Moderne Algebra as a young man who had recently joined
the group around Emmy Noether. She was a profound and forceful mathematician
who gathered around her a number of gifted young mathematicians—Emil Artin
was another—and who, by her vision of how to do mathematics, was able to bring
along a number of other powerful mathematicians such as Hasse. She was also
well established in Göttingen, which had resumed its place as the leading centre
for mathematics quite quickly after the First World War, and this gave her extra
inﬂuence. Noether and the ‘Noether boys’, as they were known, were in an ideal
place as a group to make explicit the rise of structural algebra and the relocation
(and relative demotion) of problem solving.
We have come to a third factor, which might be called taste, or priorities. One
might say that certain new problems were now the ‘right’ sort of problems to tackle.
Noether promoted a vision of mathematics in which half the task is to get the context
right in which a concrete problem can be best posed, the other half then being to
solve the problem. When context building is so elaborate it can be easy to forget
that there are old-fashioned problems too; people who know Noether’s work well
say that she did not forget.
A taste for the abstract singles out certain key players in the story of the arrival
of modern algebra. Whatever modern mathematics is taken to mean—other than

300
29
From Weber to van der Waerden
anything and everything happening recently—it means abstract and structural. This
is the most obvious feature of the Noether approach. So we can look for abstract,
structural aspects in, for example, the theory of groups. We would expect their
introduction to be a new phase in the study and use of groups, one that would happen
for identiﬁable reasons and one that would not carry everyone along. Dickson, for
example, evidently thought that abstract ﬁnite groups are interesting, and that it
would be valuable to know all the inﬁnite families of ﬁnite simple groups. This
is a very hard problem, but not so big that it would have to be divided up among
members of a team. The historian sees that it was done, that it has roots going back
at least to Jordan, and that Jordan was in turn responding to the work of Galois. The
historian notes that a few people responded to Galois’s work, Jordan among them,
and that these people also provoked others. By the time Dickson set himself this task
there was quite a body of knowledge about group theory, quite a few facts known
and techniques developed for him to use, and quite a few people who could read
his work and comment intelligently on it. Within the community of mathematicians
gathered at Chicago, Dickson probably did not have to defend his decision to do
group theory at all: there were quite a few group theorists about, and a problem
within group theory now seemed a worthwhile thing to do, one that Dickson but not
many others could be expected to tackle successfully. Of course, it helped that it had
an ancestry in Galois theory: this gave it an importance that not every problem can
have.
Jordan, on the other hand, as the very title of his book makes clear, was doing
two things, both of them different from Dickson: solving polynomial equations
and developing the theory of substitution groups. One curious question here when
abstraction is at stake is the status of the concept of a quotient group. Historians
disagree over whether Jordan possessed the concept, or whether it came in only
with the rise of abstraction and the work of people like Otto Hölder. It has been
argued, for example in (Schlimm 2008), that if not in 1870 then by 1873 Jordan
could have proved the full Jordan–Hölder theorem. That he did not is because, it is
suggested, he saw no need for a fully abstract concept and therefore had no interest
in regarding the composition factors as stand-ins for quotient groups.
Yet another factor might be that, like greatness, some are born abstract, some
achieve it, and some have it thrust upon them. Abstraction is ‘achieved’, on this
metaphor, as mathematicians responded to the suggestion of Jordan (and its echo in
the work of Cayley) that it might be worthwhile ﬁnding all (ﬁnite) groups. Jordan, as
we saw, set out many of the tools needed to get started, and identiﬁed and partially
classiﬁed interesting classes of groups.
Wussing’s argument is that abstract group theory was forced upon mathe-
maticians inasmuch as it emerged from the coalescing of three strands of work:
permutation theory, implicitly group-theoretic thinking in geometry, and number
theory. If it is the case that geometrical transformations can usefully be thought
of as forming groups, it is nonetheless far from obvious what these inﬁnite groups
permute. The common features of groups in the two settings are only recognisable
when one sheds the permutation-theoretic clothing and sees the transformations
underneath.

29.1
Introduction
301
The number-theoretic strand that Wussing considered leads to the other strand
of modern algebra: rings and ﬁelds. The move to stretch the concept of ‘integer’
as far as it will go is in tension with the classical (should one say ‘core’?)
concern of number theory: to solve polynomial equations in integers or rational
numbers, otherwise known as Diophantine analysis. Gauss’s cyclotomic integers
are a generalisation of the Gaussian integers that certainly play a number of
roles in Diophantine analysis. Kummer’s ideal numbers, on the other hand, are an
abstraction, brought in to improve the theory, the ‘machine’. The largely German
version of Galois theory replaced adjunction of roots with extension of ﬁelds, and
within an extension of the ﬁeld of rational numbers the mathematicians looked for
the corresponding algebraic integers.
The extent to which embracing this programme is staying with or moving away
from Diophantine analysis differs from the question of whether Galois theory is
or is not helping anyone to solve polynomial equations, because one might argue
that once a given polynomial equation cannot be solved by radicals it has to be
handed over to the analysts for further treatment and so ceases to be interesting to
an algebraist, whereas a number theorist cannot abandon a Diophantine equation.
In this respect it is interesting to note that the 10th of Hilbert’s famous list of
Mathematical Problems, presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians
in Paris in 1900 was:
Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with rational
integral numerical coefﬁcients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined
in a ﬁnite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.
In the end it was shown in the 1960s by Julia Robinson in America and Yuri
Matijasevich in the Soviet Union that this problem cannot be solved. Hilbert
would have been quite happy with an algorithm which would correctly say of any
Diophantine equation whether it had a solution; in particular, exactly in analogy
with Galois theory, he would have accepted a negative answer. What Robinson and
Matijasevich showed was that there is no algorithm of this kind.
There are several strands to the history of number theory. Here I have concen-
trated on the emergence of a concept of algebraic integer and attempts to generalise
the theory of prime factorisation to the new setting, concentrating on the theory
of binary quadratic forms and quadratic integers. This topic mixes with the wider
topic of polynomial rings over a ﬁeld, which interests geometers, and with the
abstract theory of ﬁelds. There are other strands, which I have not attempted to
cover: there are intimate connections with the theory of elliptic functions, there are
other heavily analytical approaches (for example, associated with the Riemann zeta
function), tests for prime numbers and searches for prime factors, and there are
Diophantine equations at every level of difﬁculty from the merely recreational to the
currently impossible. The strand I have followed leads with seeming inevitability
from Kummer to Kronecker, Kronecker to Dedekind and Weber, from them to
Hilbert, and from him to Emmy Noether, who brought in the geometrical side and
created the essentials of the modern theory of commutative rings.

302
29
From Weber to van der Waerden
Even this is a contrived story, inasmuch as Hilbert played down a major aspect
that went back to Kummer and was revived after Hilbert’s major work on number
theory was done. A ‘full’ story, whatever that might be, would have to take on board
all the strands omitted here. But even the edited story displays some of the features
of the earlier story about the emergence of abstract group theory. There is a small
group of people who want to bring about abstraction, others who oppose it, yet
others who have an eclectic attitude to it, and quite probably a majority of so-called
minor ﬁgures who were content to ignore this work.
29.2
van der Waerden on the Origins of Moderne Algebra
In 1975, prompted by the interest of Garrett Birkhoff, van der Waerden published a
short paper entitled ‘On the sources of my book Moderne Algebra’. However much
forty tumultuous years may have affected van der Waerden’s memories for events
and inﬂuences, the comments are still very interesting.
Under Emmy Noether’s famous motto “Everything is already in Dedekind”, he
explained that he had studied mathematics and physics at Amsterdam from 1919 to
1924, supplementing his study of classical algebra by reading about Galois theory
and other subjects in Weber’s “admirable” Lehrbuch der Algebra. He had also
begun to ask questions in what was always his favourite subject, algebraic geometry.
However
When I came to Göttingen in 1924, a new world opened up before me. I learned from
Emmy Noether that the tools by which my questions could be handled had already been
developed by Dedekind and Weber, by Hilbert, Lasker and Macaulay, by Steinitz and by
Emmy Noether herself.
Taking advantage of the possibility of borrowing books from the mathematical
library at Göttingen (unusual in those days) he ﬁrst caught up with (Steinitz 1910).
Chapter 5 of Moderne Algebra, he tells us, essentially followed Steinitz, but the
proof of the existence of a primitive element “is due to Galois. It was Emmy Noether
who drew my attention to this proof”.
Group theory van der Waerden said he learned from Emmy Noether’s lectures
and later conversations with Artin and Schreier in Hamburg, and he wrote little
about the topic in his own book because of the excellent textbooks (Speiser 1923)
and (Burnside 1911).
As for the theory of ideals
When I came to Göttingen one of my main problems was the generalization of Max
Noether’s “fundamental theorem” F = Af + Bφ to n dimensions. The conditions F has
to satisfy are “local conditions” in the neighbourhood of the single points of intersection of
the curves f = 0 and φ = 0. If P is a point of intersection, the local conditions deﬁne a
“primary ideal” Q, and the original ideal M = (f, φ) is the intersection of these “primary
ideals”. The terminology is modern, but the ideas are those of Max Noether and Bertini.

The Origins of Moderne Algebra

It seems, he went on, that Hilbert was the ﬁrst to realize that an n-dimensional
generalization of Noether’s theorem would be desirable (this is incorrect, as the
work of König shows).
Emmanuel Lasker, the chess champion, who took his Ph.D. degree under Hilbert’s guidance
in 1905, was the ﬁrst to solve this problem. He proved that, quite generally, every
polynomial ideal (f1, . . . , fr) is an intersection of primary ideals.
In her 1921 paper “Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen” [. . . ] Emmy Noether generalized
Lasker’s theorem to arbitrary commutative rings satisfying an ‘ascending chain condition’.
Chapter 12 of my book, Allgemeine Idealtheorie der kommutativen Ringe, is based on this
paper of Emmy Noether. The proof of Hilbert’s Finite Basis Theorem in §80 is due to Artin;
he presented it in a seminar lecture at Hamburg in 1926. The ascending chain condition is
very weak; it is satisﬁed in all polynomial domains over any ﬁeld and in many other cases.
If stronger assumptions are made concerning the ring, one can even prove that the primary
ideals are powers of prime ideals and that every ideal is a product of prime ideals. In Emmy
Noether’s paper [. . . ] (1926), ﬁve axioms were formulated which ensure that every ideal is
a product of prime ideals. Rings satisfying these axioms are now called ‘Dedekind Rings’.
In these rings Dedekind’s theory of ideals in algebraic number ﬁelds and ﬁelds of algebraic
functions of one variable is valid.
In a brief indication of how inter-active the group around Emmy Noether was,
van der Waerden then went on
The theory of Dedekind ﬁelds was presented in Chapter 14 of my book. Emmy Noether’s
proofs were simpliﬁed, making use of an idea of W. Krull contained in §3 of Krull’s paper
[. . . ] (1927). Emmy Noether was a referee for this paper, and she told Artin about it. Artin
simpliﬁed Krull’s proof and presented it in a seminar in Hamburg, in which I participated.
Artin’s simpliﬁed version of Krull’s proof was reproduced in §100.
Chapters 11 and 13 on elimination theory and polynomial ideals, we learn, drew
on Macaulay’s Cambridge Tract Modular systems, 1916, and so “are based on the
work of the school of Kronecker” while also being “closely connected with Emmy
Noether’s work”. In Chap. 15, on linear algebra, van der Waerden used Châtelet’s
Leçons sur la Théorie des Nombres (1913) on the advice again of Emmy Noether.
In 1926, having obtained his PhD, he used a Rockefeller Fellowship to study with
Hecke, Artin, and Schreier in Hamburg. He met Artin and Schreier nearly every day,
and followed Artin’s “marvellous” lectures on algebra.2 Artin already had a contract
with Springer for a book on the subject, but ﬁrst he and van der Waerden decided
to write it together on the basis of the notes van der Waerden was taking, and then
Artin apparently professed himself so pleased with the notes that he suggested van
der Waerden write the book on his own. So was born Moderne Algebra.
2Corry has pointed out to me that Artin and Schreier’s work at the time on a theory of purely
real ﬁelds would have shown van der Waerden the extent to which the real numbers can be made
a speciﬁc example of a structure that is hierarchically built up in a purely abstract and algebraic
manner, thus removing them from their hitherto privileged place in most textbooks.

Chapter 30
Revision and Final Assignment
The ﬁnal chapter is devoted to revising the topics and a discussion of the ﬁnal
assignment.
The opening two chapters of the last part of the book point towards the
mathematics of the early twentieth century, and begin to raise the question of what
was signiﬁcantly different about it. Chapter 22 offers a look at what algebra was
taken to be in the hands of one of its leading exponents around 1900 and Chap. 23
looks at the origins of the modern concept of a ﬁeld.
Chapter 24 offered an introduction to ideas that later Emmy Noether was to ﬁnd
important, if also to rewrite. The original idea is that if two plane algebraic curves,
with equations f (x, y) = 0 and g(x, y) = 0, meet in a ﬁnite number of points then
any curve through those points should lie in the ideal deﬁned by the polynomials
f (x, y) and g(x, y) in the ring C[x, y]. Suitably reﬁned, this turns out to be true, and
the reﬁnements are a nice exercise in projective geometry. But the theorem does not
generalise to higher dimensions, and that means that the ideal theory of polynomial
rings is not exactly that of number rings. The mathematicians who ﬁrst sorted this
out are Lasker and Macaulay, and the solution is the introduction of the concept of
a primary ideal. On the way we meet ideas that Hilbert was later to generalise in his
Basis Theorem.
Chapter 25 introduces Hilbert, who came to dominate mathematics around the
start of the twentieth century. His invariant theory came as a shock.1 What was
the new viewpoint from which it all seemed easy (or, according to Gordan, “Not
mathematics but theology”.)? By the way, how scrupulously precise was it?
Hilbert went on to do many things in his Zahlbericht, not all of which we
could discuss in Chap. 26. In particular, his account of the work of Kummer and
Kronecker, which he seems to have found uncongenial, has been omitted entirely
from this book. But one of the things Hilbert did do was to bring number theory and

Galois theory together, and another was to sloganise. How important was this for
the development of modern algebra?
Chapter 27 is a story about the rise of group theory. It is selective, and potentially
misleading, but enough to indicate that at some stage, and notwithstanding all
its rich connections to other branches of mathematics, group theory became a
subject in its own right, with its own priorities. Very little could be said about its
particular methods, in particular the search for groups of particular orders (p2, pqr,
etc.), Sylow’s theorems, the representation theories of Burnside and Frobenius, and
Burnside’s magniﬁcent theorem that groups of order paqb are solvable. You should
consult the resources section for some remarks about groups and geometry in the
late nineteenth century.
Chapter 28 tells a similar story about the rise of ring theory, concentrating on the
ﬁrst of Emmy Noether’s contributions. It would be perverse to claim that what she
did was merely a continuation of what had gone on before, but to what extent and
in what ways was it signiﬁcantly new?
Chapter 29 follows this up by taking a look at the change from Hilbert’s idea of
algebra to van der Waerden’s. Leo Corry’s discussion is very helpful here.
Between them, these chapters look at several different aspects of algebra and
allow us to study the emergence of the modern concepts of group, ring, and ﬁeld.
They are framed by Hilbert’s inﬂuential account and van der Waerden’s even more
inﬂuential replacement, in an analysis by the historian Leo Corry.
The ﬁnal assessment counted for 60% of the marks. Over the years I set several
different ﬁnal essays, trying to push the students to use their reﬂections on what they
had learned in 3 years of algebra, all of it very different from anything they had done
at school, while constraining them to address a historical question.
The ﬁrst two questions I used were straight-forward:
•
Describe in detail at least three mathematical advances drawn from this book
(preferably from the list on page xv). On the basis of these examples, and any
others you see ﬁt to introduce, consider the claim that during the ‘long’ nineteenth
century (1789–1914) algebra became modern algebra for good reasons. What do
you take this claim to mean and how valid do you take it to be?
•
Describe three key advances that contributed to the creation of modern algebra,
making clear what was important about them. To what extent do you think
modern algebra was created by accident or by design? Note that your three
examples should be well spaced throughout the subject and the period.
But it proved more interesting to ask the students to respond to two more striking
opinions.
•
Emmy Noether once said that “Everything is already in Dedekind”. As regards
modern algebra, what do you think she could have meant by that, and how correct
do you think she was?

Consider the following extract from Alfred North Whitehead, Process and
Reality, 1929 (Free Press ed. 1979, 39):
. . . So far as concerns philosophy only a selected group can be explicitly mentioned.
There is no point in endeavouring to force the interpretations of divergent philosophers
into a vague agreement. What is important is that the scheme of interpretation here
adopted can claim for each of its main positions the express authority of one, or the
other, of some supreme master of thought – Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Locke, Hume,
Kant. But ultimately nothing rests on authority; the ﬁnal court of appeal is intrinsic
reasonableness.
The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it
consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought
which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of
general ideas scattered through them. His personal endowments, his wide opportunities
for experience at a great period of civilization, his inheritance of an intellectual tradition
not yet stiffened by excessive systematization, have made his writing an inexhaustible
mine of suggestion.
I would have added the name of Leibniz to the list, but in any case the sentence
I have italicised has become famous. I then asked:
How reasonable would it be to say that modern algebra consists of a series of
footnotes to Gauss?
For the Noether question I offered the following advice.
This famous quotations is one of those aphorisms that makes you think a variety
of things at once, such as: It’s a brilliant insight; it’s plain wrong; it’s true in these
ways but not in those; it would have seemed more true then than now; and even
‘Huh?’. Spend some time sorting these and other responses out in your mind before
you start to write. When you do:
•
Start by making a list of what you take to be the main sources or examples of
modern algebra in the nineteenth century, and then select three that you will use
to assess her remark.
•
Look for moments when the nature of the subject changed, or the criteria for its
importance shifted.
•
Who else might she have considered, and how different would her answer have
been then?
•
Who was she possibly ignoring; why? Do remember her actual opinions.
•
You are not being asked to write about Noether’s own work, but before writing
your essay you should assume that she thought that she too had important things
to say; don’t write an essay that leaves no room for work after Dedekind.
I varied this advice slightly for the Whitehead question. I asked them to
think about why Whitehead, an eminent ﬁgure in his day, might have thought it
worth while making a remark of this kind, given that it is plainly intended to be
provocative, and think about how he interpreted it so that it becomes more plausible.
I asked them to consider if, as applied to modern algebra, the aphorism might have

seemed more (or less) true in 1900 or 1930 than today, and if it was more likely to
be believed by some people than others (and if so, who?). More speciﬁcally:
•
it might seem clear that for present purposes Dirichlet was – and saw himself as
– a footnote to Gauss. But Dedekind and Weber? Emmy Noether? Artin and van
der Waerden?
•
when, if at all, does this claim lose its force?
•
or would you prefer to argue that the claim is plain silly, and simply false to the
history as you see it.
•
look for moments when the nature of the subject changed, or the criteria for its
importance shifted.
•
which other mathematicians might have been so inspirational? The obvious
alternative is Galois, but don’t be afraid to look widely. Be prepared to argue well,
and to give other people their due, and remember that a footnote (in Whitehead’s
sense) can be as good as the original, or better.
For each essay I also recommended that
•
the essay should show how and to what extent judgements of this kind are
grounded in the mathematics;
•
wealth of mathematical detail is not necessary, but mathematical accuracy is;
•
the response is grounded in evidence presented in your essay;
•
the essay should not end up with a ﬁnal paragraph full of superlatives that don’t
stand up to scrutiny.
Finally, I urged that all manner of conclusions are OK—if well argued! These
questions do not have a right answer; enough exciting things have happened in a
century of mathematics (your chosen subject at university, after all) to make the
question worth discussing. I asked students to draw on their years as mathematics
students to offer an informed opinion about the growth of modern algebra.
The best essays would put forward an argument that is convincing, supported
with relevant facts, and well organised. The judgements it reaches are, when
necessary, subtle and balanced. The coverage should be broad, with no potentially
damaging omissions, and no unnecessary digressions. Ideally, and without being
cranky, the essay would be original in its emphases, or its conclusions, and will
make good use of quotations. Accuracy is important: the historical facts must be
correct and to the point, the mathematics correct, clear, and relevant.

Appendix A
Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth
Century
A.1
Introduction
We look ﬁrst at attempts in the eighteenth century to formulate and then prove a
theorem about the roots of polynomial equations. Then we look at Gauss’s criticisms
of these attempts, and at one of his own, for what they can tell us about what was
(perhaps tacitly) understood in algebra at the time and what was demanded of a
proof.
A.2
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra Before Gauss
As the calculus became established in the early eighteenth century, people became
interested in evaluating integrals, among them

dx
x + a ,

dx
x2 + a2 ,

dx
x2 −a2 ,

(x + a)dx
x2 + bx + c.
This led naturally to the question of evaluating integrals of the form
 P(x)dx
Q(x) ,
where P and Q are polynomials. If the denominator, Q, could be factored into linear
and quadratic factors the question would reduce to one already solved. The existence
of such a factorisation is one of the forms of the fundamental theorem of algebra:
Theorem. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: A polynomial of degree n can
always be factored into n linear factors, possibly with repetitions.

A
Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth Century
I have made the above statement deliberately vague, and not stated whether the
coefﬁcients are real or complex or whether the factors are to be real or complex.
Eighteenth century mathematicians of the period were not sure what to make of
complex numbers, and always sought real answers, so they often spoke of proving
that every polynomial can be factored into terms of degree one or two.1
Some mathematicians disputed that the theorem was even true, as apparently
Leibniz had in the seventeenth century. It was well known, of course, that there was
a formula expressing the roots of a quadratic equation in terms of the coefﬁcients.
The equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0
has roots
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
,
—that, or an equivalent result, had been known for over 3000 years by then. It
was also known that in the sixteenth century Tartaglia and Cardano had solved the
general cubic equation and given the result as a formula involving both cube roots
and square roots. The paradoxical result that when the cubic equation has three real
roots the formula seems inevitably to require working with complex numbers had
been somewhat illuminated by Bombelli a generation later. People also knew that
Ferrari, a colleague of Cardano’s, had shown how to solve equations of degree 4,
but crucially, no-one knew of a general method for solving equations of degree 5 or
more.
Euler did believe in the fundamental theorem of algebra. He wrote to Johann
Bernoulli on 15 September 1739 to say that he believed that every polynomial
equation could be resolved into the right number of linear factors and quadratic
factors, although he admitted he did not have a proof. He needed this result in order
to complete his solution of the problem of solving linear differential equation s of
any order with constant coefﬁcients. He repeated the claim in a letter he wrote to
Johann’s nephew, Nicolaus (I) Bernoulli on 1 September 1742, but Nicolaus was
not convinced, and offered as a counter-example
x4 −4x3 + 2x2 + 4x + 4 = 0,
which has these roots

Nicolaus found the roots, but denied that they could be written in the form a +
b
√
−1.2
Euler replied on 10 November. He factored Nicolaus’s example as a product of
two quadratics, and claimed that he could now prove the fundamental theorem of
algebra for all polynomials of degree at most four. He also discussed the problem
with Christian Goldbach, who queried the theorem for polynomials of the form
x4 + px + q; Euler corrected him.3 Then Nicolaus Bernoulli replied, now agreeing
with Euler that the fundamental theorem of algebra was true. He also claimed that he
could prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, provided every imaginary quantity
is an elementary function of quantities of the form a +b
√
−1, a view, he added, that
nobody denies (evidently he had changed his own position).
Euler’s Introductio in Analysin Inﬁnitorum on the theory and use of inﬁnite
series is one the ﬁrst great books of mathematics. The later-to-be-famous zeta
function appears here, as does Euler’s uniﬁcation of the logarithmic, exponential,
and trigonometric functions. Euler began by deﬁning what a function is (a curious
mixture of the input-output deﬁnition we use today and a conﬁdent belief that any
function could be represented as an inﬁnite series). In Chapter II Euler discussed
how functions could be treated, and made many assertions about polynomial
functions (it is understood that their coefﬁcients are real): they have either linear or
quadratic factors; the number of complex factors is always even (§30); the complex
factors can always be paired in such a way that the product of these pairs is real
(§32); a polynomial of odd degree always has a real factor (§34); a polynomial of
odd degree has an odd number of real factors (§35); a polynomial of even degree
has an even number of real factors (§36).
Euler returned to this theme in Chapter IX when he offered partial proofs of these
claims—but he never attempted to justify them fully, and for this his great rival, Jean
le Rond d’Alembert, criticised him. Euler replied that the book had been ﬁnished in
1745, since when he had made great progress “although I freely confess that I do
not yet have a solid demonstration that every algebraic expression can be resolved
into real trinomial factors”.4
As one might suspect, a priority dispute was underway, for by then d’Alembert
had published his own proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which he had
submitted to the Berlin Academy in 1746 (it was published in 1748). It grew out
of an earlier account (from 1745) , where d’Alembert had argued that any algebraic
function of a complex number takes values that are complex numbers, and so, by
regarding a root of a polynomial equation as such a function, a polynomial equation
has complex roots. Because the equation has real coefﬁcients it follows that if a +
b
√
−1 is one root then a −b
√
−1 is another. It seems that he soon came to regard
this account altogether too naive—it is little more than assuming what has to be
proved—in 1746 d’Alembert tried to prove the existence of complex roots directly.
2Curiously, Maple gives the roots in the form Bernoulli found them.
3See Euler (2015), nos. 62 and 63, 5 February 1743 and 26 February 1743.

Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth Century
Now he took the polynomial equation
xm + axm−1 + · · · + f x + g = 0
and looked at the curve with equation
G(x, y) = xm + axm−1 + · · · + f x + y = 0.
He rewrote this as a power series for x:
x = am/n + byr/s + · · · ,
using the methods of the calculus and inﬁnite series, and deduced that when y is
small x is necessarily complex. He then deduced that x will be complex for any
value of y, and so found a complex value for x when y = g.
This is generally considered to be the ﬁrst serious attempt on the fundamental
theorem of algebra, although it contains no attempt to prove the convergence of the
series for x, or to show that claim is valid for all values of y and not just a bounded
set.5
Then in 1749 Euler wrote his great memoir on the subject (it was published in
1751). In it, he aimed to show that every root of a polynomial equation is of the
form a + b
√
−1, where a and b are real.
Euler dealt with polynomials of odd degree by arguing that when |x| is very
large the value of the polynomial is large and of one sign when x is negative and the
other when x is positive, and so it has at least one real root. Similarly, a polynomial
of even degree with a negative constant term has at least two real roots. He then
claimed that a polynomial of degree 2km, m odd, can be treated as one of degree
2k+1 by multiplying it by powers of x. That left polynomials of degree exactly a
power of 2, and he dealt with the cases where the polynomial is of degree 4, 8, 16
and ﬁnally 2k.
To solve a polynomial equation of degree 4, Euler wrote it, as it was well-known
that one could, in the form
x4 + bx2 + cx + d = 0.
If this can be factorised, it can be written as
(x2 + ux + λ)(x2 −ux + μ) = 0.
Euler deduced from that that u satisﬁes this equation:
u6 + 2bu4 + (b2 −4d)u2 −c2 = 0.
5In his (1799) Gauss was to criticise d’Alembert’s use of inﬁnite series in his proof, and showed
by means of an example that it was unsound, while politely admitting that it was perhaps capable
of being re-cast in a more reliable form.

A

313
The point is not so much that this equation is a cubic in u2 and so can be solved, as
to hint at a pattern upon which Euler was to rely when he got to the general case.
Here, he observed that the equation for u can be solved according to the second of
his basic assumptions, so u is known, and ﬁnally he showed that λ and μ can be
found as rational functions of b, c, d, and u.
Euler dealt with the equations of degree 8 and 16 similarly. When it came to
general case of a polynomial equation of degree 2k Euler invoked the theory of the
symmetric functions that went back to Newton. If a polynomial expression of degree
n can be written as a product of n linear factors, say
xn + a1xn−1 + · · · an−1x + an = (x −α1)(x −α2) . . . (x −αn),
then
a1 = −(α1 + α2 + . . . αn)
(A.1)
· · ·
an = (−1)nα1 · α2 · · · αn.
(A.2)
The expressions on the right are the various symmetric functions of the αs. The
fundamental theorems about them are:
1. that every rational function in the αs that is symmetric (i.e. invariant under all
permutations of the αs) is a rational function of the symmetric functions.
2. a rational function of the αs that takes k distinct values as the αs undergo their
n! permutations satisfy an equation of degree k whose coefﬁcients are rational
functions of the coefﬁcients of the original equation.
When the polynomial equation has degree 4, Euler argued that u must be the sum
of two of the roots, because from the formal identity
x4+bx2+cx +d = (x2+ux +λ)(x2−ux +μ) = (x −α1)(x −α2)(x −α3)(x −α4)
some expression of the form u = α1 + α2 must be true and so u takes on 6 values
as the roots are permuted, which is why it satisﬁes an equation of degree 6. In fact,
the possibilities are
u1 = α1 + α2 = p = −u4 = −(α3 + α4),
u2 = α1 + α3 = q = −u5 = −(α2 + α4),
u3 = α1 + α4 = r = −u6 = −(α2 + α3),
so the equation for u is
(u2 −p2)(u2 −q2)(u2 −r2) = 0.

314
A
Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth Century
This is indeed an equation of even degree with a negative constant term −p2q2r2,
and Euler did check that pqr is real. He showed in fact that
pqr = (α1 + α2)(α1 + α3)(α1 + α4),
which is invariant under all permutations of the αs, and so is expressible rationally
in terms of the coefﬁcients of the original equation, and hence real.
The proof in the case of a polynomial equation of degree 2k was only sketched by
Euler. He supposed the equation had no term of degree 2k −1, which is trivial, and
investigated the consequences of formally factorising it into two factors of degree
2k−1. This gave him an equation of the form
x2k + bx2k−2 + · · · = (x2k−1 + ux2k−1−1 + · · · )(x2k−1 −ux2k−1−1 + · · · ).
The so-far-undetermined coefﬁcients are 2k −1 in number, equal to the number of
coefﬁcients in the original polynomial.
The coefﬁcient u must be a sum of half the roots of the equation, so 2k−1 in
number, so u takes 2kC2k−1 = 2N values, where N is odd, as Euler showed. So, he
said, u satisﬁes an equation of degree 2N with real coefﬁcients that, moreover, is of
the form
(u2 −p2
1)(u2 −p2
2) · · · (u2 −p2
N) = 0,
with a negative, real, constant term. So u2 is a known real quantity and the remaining
coefﬁcients in each of the two factors can then be written as rational functions of u
and the coefﬁcients of the original polynomial.
Whatever the weaknesses of this argument, it acquires a certain amount more
force when the equations of degrees 8 and 16 are done explicitly ﬁrst. The serious
attempt to show why the computations work in these cases gives weight to the
feeling that they can be trusted to work in general. That said, Euler’s approach
founders on the confusion of two questions: is every imaginary number (for which
read: number-like object that is not real) of the form a + b√−1 for real a and b?
and does every polynomial equation (with real coefﬁcients) have exactly as many
roots as its degree.
In his (1772) Lagrange set himself the task of completing Euler’s proof of
the fundamental theorem of algebra, and the resulting argument is reasonably
convincing, but not completely so, and it was left to the twenty-year-old Carl
Friedrich Gauss in his doctoral dissertation of 1797 to make the decisive criticism.
Gauss addressed it chieﬂy to d’Alembert’s attempts, but it applies to all the others,
as he said elsewhere.
Gauss objected that d’Alembert had not proved that the roots actually exist;
instead he had assumed the existence of the roots and showed only that, in that
case, they had to be complex. The possibilities that the roots did exist but could
not be manipulated like numbers; or that the roots did not even exist, had not been

A
Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth Century
315
considered. That said, Gauss admitted that “the true strength of the proof seems to
me not to have been weakened at all by all the objections”, and remarked that one
could build a rigorous proof on that foundation (in Werke 3, 11).6
Gauss then turned to the second of Euler’s arguments, that reduced the problem
to the factorisation of polynomials of degree a power of 2; once factorisation is
assured the fundamental theorem of algebra follows immediately by induction. Here
Gauss objected that not only did Euler’s approach tacitly assume that polynomial
equations have roots, but the proof of factorisation replaced the original equation
with a system of quadratic equations for which there is no guarantee that solutions
exist, for it produces 2m−1 equations in 2m−2 unknowns. Gauss then commented
that Lagrange (1772) had thoroughly resolved some of the objections to Euler’s
argument, but gaps in the proof remained, notably the assumptions that polynomial
equations have roots and that the only problem is to show that they are complex
numbers.7
From Gauss’s Critique
Euler tacitly supposes that the equation X = 0 has 2m roots, of which he determines the
sum to be = 0 because the second term in X is missing. What I think of this licence I have
already declared in art. 3. The proposition that the sum of all the roots of an equation is equal
to the ﬁrst coefﬁcient with the sign changed, does not seem applicable to other equations
unless they have roots; now although it ought to be proved by this same demonstration
that the equation X = 0 really does have roots, it does not seem permissible to suppose
the existence of these. No doubt those people who have not yet penetrated the fallacy of
this expression will reply, “Here it has not been demonstrated that the equation X = 0
can be satisﬁed (for this expression means that the equation has roots) but it has only been
demonstrated that the equation can be satisﬁed by values of x of the form a + b
√
−1;
and indeed that is taken as axiomatic”. But although types of quantities other than real and
imaginary a + b
√
−1 cannot be conceived of, it does not seem sufﬁciently clear how the
proposition awaiting demonstration differs from that supposed as axiomatic. [. . . ] Therefore
that axiom can have no other meaning than this: Any equation can be satisﬁed either by the
real value of an unknown, or by an imaginary value expressed in the form a + b
√
−1, or
perhaps by a value in some other form which we do not know, or by a value which is not
totally contained in any form. But how such quantities which are shadowy and inconceivable
can be added or multiplied is certainly not understood with the clarity which is required in
mathematics. [. . . ]
Finally, Lagrange has dealt with our theorem in the commentary Sur la Forme des Racines
Imaginaires des Equations, 1772. This great geometer handed his work to the printers when
he was worn out with completing Euler’s ﬁrst demonstration [. . . ]. However, he does not
touch upon the third objection at all, for all his investigation is built upon the supposition
that an equation of the mth degree does in fact have roots.
6For an evaluation of D’Alembert’s proof and Gauss’s criticism of it, see Gilain’s introduction in
(D’Alembert 1746, lxxvi–xcii).
7Remmert has aptly remarked that “the Gaussian objection against the attempts of Euler–Lagrange
was invalidated as soon as Algebra was able to guarantee the existence of a splitting ﬁeld for every
polynomial.” (in Ebbinghaus et al. 1990, 105). Remmert went on to point out that this had been
already observed by Kneser in 1888.

Polynomial Equations in the Eighteenth Century
Gauss then offered his own proof, which dealt systematically with polynomial
equations of any degree. He took a polynomial of the form
f (z) = zm + a1zm−1 + . . . + am
with real coefﬁcients, and looked for its roots in an inﬁnite plane whose points are
speciﬁed by polar coordinates r, φ. Such roots will be the common points of the
equations
U = rm cos mφ + a1rm−1 cos(m −1)φ + . . . + am−1r cos φ + am = 0,
and
T = rm sin mφ + a1rm−1 sin(m −1)φ + . . . + am−1r sin φ = 0 ,
which are the curves deﬁned by the real and imaginary parts of the equation f (z) =
0: Ref (z) = 0 and Imf (z) = 0, as z varies in the plane of complex numbers. Gauss
now argued as follows. Outside a suitably large circle of radius R centred on the
origin each of these curves meets a concentric circle of radius r > R in two disjoint
sets of 2m distinct points, and therefore these curves consist of 2m arcs going off to
inﬁnity in the plane (let r increase indeﬁnitely). Moreover, for suitably large values
of R the zm is dominant and therefore the curves Ref (z) = 0 and Imf (z) = 0 meet
the circle of radius R alternately. Gauss now endeavoured to show that inside the
circle of radius R these curves are each made up of m disjoint ‘parabola-shaped’
pieces, but they can only join up if a curve Ref (z) = 0 crosses a curve Imf (z) = 0.
At such a crossing point, the equation has a root, and so the fundamental theorem
of algebra is proved.
He argued that the curves are real algebraic curves in m pieces that come from
and go to inﬁnity; they cannot stop, break apart, or spiral to a point in the fashion
of some transcendental curves (such as y = 1/ log(x)). Rather, as he put it, an
algebraic curve that enters a bounded region of the plane also leaves it (§ 21,
footnote). Insofar as this is no easier to prove than the fundamental theorem of
algebra itself, Gauss’s proof is defective. That said, the topological nature of Gauss’s
proof is attractive, and Gauss saw it as the heart of the matter. This was a remarkable
insight at a time when neither Gauss nor any one else could have provided a proper
distinction between the real numbers and the rational numbers.
Gauss’s second proof (dated late 1815) is a tour de force in the use of symmetric
functions and does not involve complex variables.8 His third proof (dated January
1816) in many ways returns to the ideas of his ﬁrst. On this occasion, Gauss wanted
to show that there is a root of the polynomial f (z) within a circle of suitably large
radius R by considering the quantity the square of the modulus of f (z), which is
t2+u2, where t = Re f (z) and u = Im f (z). He was able to deﬁne a double integral

over the region 0 ≤r ≤R , 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π that—on the assumption that t and u do
not simultaneously vanish—took the value 0 when integrated ﬁrst with respect to ϕ
and then with respect to r, but a non-zero value 0 when integrated ﬁrst with respect
to r and then with respect to ϕ. The only way out of this apparent contradiction was
to deny its fundamental assumption that the integral may be evaluated in both orders
and give the same result, and therefore Gauss concluded that there were points where
t2 +u2 = 0, and so t and u simultaneously vanish, and so the polynomial has a root.
The proof therefore rests on the insight that when a double integral is replaced by
a repeated integral the order of integration may matter when the integrand becomes
inﬁnite (in later language, has a simple pole).
The fourth and last of Gauss’s proofs was published in 1849 and was produced
for the 50th anniversary of his ﬁrst proof, the occasion for a celebration of Gauss’s
distinguished career. Gauss dropped his criticisms of the eighteenth century proofs,
noted that Cayley had given a proof more recently, and then took up his ﬁrst proof
again. He now dealt with the case of multiple roots and the possible conﬁgurations
of curves that can arise, and concluded that all roots occur in the way described.

Appendix B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
B.1
Composition Theory
The table of forms of discriminant −161 in Sect. 4.5 shows that of the eight
possibilities a priori, exactly half occur. It illustrates a deep but important theorem
that Gauss was able to establish: the combinations that occur are those for which the
product of the characters (scoring Y as 1 and N as −1) is +1. To prove this theorem,
Gauss developed his theory of composition of forms, which is a way of combining
two forms of a given discriminant to produce a third of the same discriminant. He
also required a theory of ternary forms (quadratic forms in three variables, x, y, and
z), but it was later shown by Arndt (1859) that this can be reduced to an application
of a theorem of Legendre’s.1
We have already seen in Sect. 3.2 that if a quadratic form Q represents a product
mm′ then there are quadratic forms of the same discriminant as Q that represent m
and m′. The aim of the composition of forms is the reverse statement: given two
quadratic forms, one that represents m and one that represents m′, to produce a
quadratic form that represents the product mm′.
To be precise, Gauss’s composition of forms can be carried out for forms
of different discriminants that satisfy certain requirements, but we shall just
consider the case where the discriminants are the same—in this case the ‘certain
requirements’ are automatically met.
Given two quadratic forms
Q1(x, y) = a1x2
1 + 2b1x1y1 + c1y2
1
and
Q2(x, y) = a2x2
2 + 2b2x2y2 + c2y2

1Legendre’s theorem says that the ternary form ax2 + by2 + cz2 has solutions in positive integers
if and only if a, b, c are not all of the same sign and −bc, −ca, −ab are squares modulo a, b, c
respectively. Gauss had used his theory of ternary forms to deduce this result.

Gauss and Composition of Forms
with the same discriminant, their composite should be a form
Q(X, Y) = AX2 + 2BXY + CY 2
of the same discriminant, where
X = p0x1x2+p1x1y2+p2x2y1+p3y1y2, Y = q0x1x2+q1x1y2+q2x2y1+q3y1y2,
where p0, . . . , p3, q0, . . . , q3 are all integers. These conditions can be met, as will
be shown below.
We also require that if the form Q1(x, y) is equivalent to a form Q′
1(x, y), and
the form Q2(x, y) is equivalent to a form Q′
2(x, y) then the composite of Q1(x, y)
and Q2(x, y) is equivalent to the composite of Q′
1(x, y) and Q′
2(x, y). This extends
composition to classes of forms. A signiﬁcant problem with the theory, however, is
that the composition of two forms is not unique: it is only determined up to proper
equivalence. So every theorem about the composition of forms must be extended to
show that any choices made along the way result in equivalent outcomes.
It cannot be said that composition theory is pleasant. In his book (Weil 1984,
pp. 332–335) André Weil sketched Legendre’s approach, which we will look at
below, and then remarked
No doubt the Gaussian theory, as Gauss chose to describe it (DA.Art.234–260), is far more
elaborate; so much so, indeed, that it remained a stumbling-block for all readers of the
Disquisitiones until Dirichlet restored its simplicity by going back very nearly to Legendre’s
original construction (Dir. II. 107–114, 1851).
Weil then speculated that Legendre’s ideas may have inﬂuenced Gauss, contrary
to Gauss’s claim that he ﬁrst saw Legendre’s book after “the greater part” of the
Disquisitiones was in print; Gauss started work on composition of forms late in
1798, and might have seen Legendre’s Essai on a visit to Pfaff around that time.
Be that as it may, as Weil went on to remark
But there is at the same time an essential difference between his treatment and that of Gauss.
Legendre never made the distinction between proper and improper equivalence; his classes
of quadratic forms are the Lagrangian classes [. . . ]. Thus it was left to Gauss to discover that
the “Gaussian” classes, under the operation of composition, make up a ﬁnite commutative
group, and to draw the consequences of this fact.
Gauss for his part established that composition is well-deﬁned on classes (and
indeed orders and genera) and that the classes of a given discriminant form what
we would call (but he could not!) a ﬁnite abelian group. The principal class, which
contains the form (1, 0, d), plays the role of the identity element. The principal
genus consists exactly of the squares of classes of forms. Moreover, the characters
are a group homomorphism onto the group {1, −1}.
As we have seen Gauss’s theory of composition of forms was regarded as
important in its day because it delivers insights into what quadratic forms of a given
discriminant can represent a given number, even though it has always been regarded
as very hard.

B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
321
Using his composition theory, Gauss showed (§252) that for a given discriminant
there are the same number of classes in every genus of the same order. Moreover
(§261) half of the assignable characters for a positive nonsquare discriminant
correspond to no properly primitive genus, and if the discriminant is negative to no
properly primitive positive genus. From this he deduced a new proof of the theorem
of quadratic reciprocity in §262. As for the half of the assignable characters that are
not excluded, he showed after a lengthy ‘digression’ into the theory of forms of the
form ax2 + by2 + cz2 that they all do occur (§287). He was understandably pleased
with this result, and wrote
We believe that these theorems are among the most beautiful in the theory of binary forms,
especially because, despite their extreme simplicity, they are so profound that a rigorous
demonstration requires the help of many other investigations.
This is, when you think about, a very revealing statement about what he took good
mathematics to be.
Gauss’s Route to the Above Results
Although we cannot follow Gauss’s account of composition of forms in full detail,
we can indicate how it was able to deliver the results that it did in Gauss’s hands,
and this will show some of the ‘group-theoretic’ ideas at work underneath.2 To do
so we shall employ some notation that he did not provide. We write χ(f ) for the
genus of a form f and O(f ) for its order, ff ′ for the composite of the forms f and
f ′, and f ⇝a to indicate that the form f represents the number a. We shall also
restrict our attention to forms of a ﬁxed discriminant.
In §246 Gauss investigated how the genus of a composite of two forms is
connected with the genera of the individual forms. In our restricted setting, the
forms f , f ′, and F = ff ′ all have the same determinant, say D. Suppose that
p is an odd prime dividing D. There are ﬁxed relationships for the forms f and f ′,
and if f ⇝a and f ′ ⇝a′ then F = ff ′ ⇝aa′. The ﬁxed relationships determine
the values of

a
p

and

a′
p

and therefore of

aa′
p

, so the genus of F = ff ′ is
determined from the genera of f and f ′.
Similar arguments deal with the case when 4 enters the total character of F, and
when D is congruent to 2 or 6 mod 8; I omit these.
In §247 Gauss deduced that if f, g, f ′, g′ are primitive forms, O(f ) = O(g),
χ(f ) = χ(g), O(f ′) = O(g′), and χ(f ′) = χ(g′), then χ(ff ′) = χ(gg′).
If moreover f belongs to the principal genus, so all its characters are +1, then
χ(ff ′) = χ(f ′). And if f and f ′ are properly primitive forms of the same genus
then ff ′ is in the principal genus, which implies in particular that the form f 2 = ff
is in the principal genus.
2Among modern accounts, see §2.2 and §2.3 of Lemmermeyer (2000).

322
B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
In §248 Gauss deduced that if χ(f ) = χ(g) and χ(f ′) = χ(g′) then χ(ff ′) =
χ(gg′).
In §252 Gauss showed that for a given determinant there are the same number of
classes in every genus of the same order (and in §253 he observed that this result is
false if the condition on the order is dropped). The proof is as follows. Let G be a
genus composed of the classes K0, K1, . . . Kn−1 and H another genus in the same
order. Let L be a class in the genus H. There is a properly primitive class M such
that MK0 = L. Consider the classes MK0, MK1, . . . MKn−1; by §249 they are all
distinct, by §248 they are all of the same genus, and all the classes in H arise in this
way. Therefore the genera contain the same number of classes.
A crucial role is played by the ambiguous classes. Gauss enumerated them in
§257, and by a long argument in §258 he showed that the number of properly
primitive ambiguous classes of a given determinant is half the number of assignable
characters.
In §260 he considered the properly primitive ambiguous classes of a given
determinant, say H0, H1, . . . Hn−1, where H is the principal class. He took a form
k and considered the classes kH0, kH1, . . . kHn−1; they are distinct and properly
primitive. If k2 = K then also (kHj)2 = K, and conversely, if k2
1 = K then
k1 = kHj for some j = 0, 1, . . . n −1 (again I omit the argument). Therefore, if
the number of properly primitive classes is r and the number of properly primitive
ambiguous classes is n then the number of properly primitive classes that are squares
is r/n.
Gauss then returned to the example of forms of discriminant −161 and com-
mented
Thus, e.g., for D = −161, the number of all positive properly primitive classes is 16,
the number of ambiguous classes 4, so the number of classes that can arise from the
duplication of any class must be 4. As a matter of fact we ﬁnd that all classes contained
in the principal genus are endowed with this property; thus the principal class (1, 0, 161)
results from the duplication of the four ambiguous classes; (2, 1, 81) from duplicating
the classes (9, 1, 18), (9, −1, 18), (11, 2, 15), (11, −2, 15); (9, 1, 18) from duplicating the
classes (3, 1, 54), (6, 1, 27), (5, −2, 33), (10, 3, 17); ﬁnally (9, −1, 18) from duplicating
the classes (3, −1, 54), (6, −1, 27), (5, 2, 33), (10, −3, 17).
In §261 Gauss put all this together to deduce that “Half of all the characters
assignable for a given determinant cannot belong to any properly primitive genus”.
As he noted for clarity, the result should be interpreted to mean that at least half the
assignable characters do not occur.
To prove this, Gauss denoted the number of properly primitive genera by m and
the number of classes in each genus by k, so that the number of classes is km.
He denoted the number of characters by n, and therefore the number of properly
primitive ambiguous classes is n/2 (by §258). Therefore (by §260) the number of
properly primitive squares is 2km/n, and (by §247) these classes belong to the
principal genus. Therefore if (as Gauss promised to show later) all classes in the
principal genus are squares then 2km/n = k and so m = n/2. In any case it is
impossible that 2km/n > k, so at least half the assignable characters do not occur.

B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
323
To ﬁnish his analysis, Gauss developed a theory of ternary forms, which will not
be discussed. Using it, he could deduce (§286) that every form in the principal genus
arises as a square—a result that came to be called the principal genus theorem—
and then (§287) that exactly half the assignable characters do occur. In this way
he established he had earlier called (§261) “the truth of this profound proposition
concerning the most deeply hidden properties of numbers”.
This result has struck generations of later mathematicians as important, and they
have explored the connections that lead to its proof. Among the most important
of these has been Dirichlet’s class number formula, which Dedekind used to
prove these results of Gauss’s in Supplement 4 of Dirichlet’s Lectures. To quote
Lemmermeyer (2007, p. 538)
Dedekind returns to genus theory of binary quadratic forms in his supplement X: §153
gives the ﬁrst inequality, §154 the quadratic reciprocity law, and in §155 he observes that
the second inequality of genus theory (the existence of half of all the possible genera) is
essentially identical with the principal genus theorem: “Every class of the principal genus
arises from duplication.” He then adds:
It is impossible for us to communicate the proof, which Gauss has based on the
theory of ternary quadratic forms; but since this deep theorem is the most beautiful
conclusion of the theory of composition, we cannot help but derive this result,
without the use of Dirichlet’s principles, in a second way, which will also form the
basis for other important investigations.3
B.2
Gaussian Composition of Forms
Consider the simplest case, the product of the forms x2 + y2 and u2 + v2, given by
(x2 + y2)(u2 + v2) = (xu −yv)2 + (xv + yu)2 = X2 + Y 2.
The product is of degree four in the original variables x, y, u, v but of degree two in
the new variables
X = xu −yv, Y = xv + yu.
The idea behind composition of forms is to recognise in the product of two forms
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 and a′u2 + 2b′uv + c′v2, which is of degree four in the variables
x, y, u, v, two expressions X and Y of degree two in those variables such that the
product is of degree two in X and Y. So in §234 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae
Gauss looked for integer values of the constants
p1, p2, p3, p4, and q1, q2, q3, q4

composite of the other forms. It may help to notice that these products are the

When Eq. (B.1) is expanded, it becomes a complicated set of nine conditions for
the eight unknown ps and qs, from which it follows, after a considerable amount of
work, that the ps and qs can be found only under certain conditions, such as that the
discriminant of the forms are the same. In this case, the discriminant of the product
is the same as the discriminants of the original two forms. But Gauss could not ﬁnish
here, because when the conditions are met it does not follow that the ps and qs are
uniquely deﬁned.
To resolve the ambiguity in the composition, Gauss had to ﬁnd a way of ﬁxing
the signs. It turns out that on any deﬁnition of a composite,
p1q2 −p2q1 = ±a, and p1q3 −p3q1 = ±a′.
So Gauss added these condition to ﬁx uniqueness, that the above signs are both +:
p1q2 −p2q1 = a, and p1q3 −p3q1 = a′.

B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
325
We can see that some skill is required to produce a useful deﬁnition of the
composite of two forms, because we have the identity
(ax2 + 2bxy + cy2)(a′u2 + 2b′uv + c′v2) =
1
aa′ (X2 + R2Y 2),
(B.2)
where b2 −ac = −R2 = b′2 −a′c′ and
X = aa′xu + ab′xv + ba′yu + (bb′ + nyv)yv, Y = (ax + by)v + (a′u + b′v)y.
If we took this as the correct deﬁnition the composite of any two forms with the
same discriminant would be the trivial form.
In this case, we ﬁnd that
p1q2 −p2q1 = a, p1q3 −p3q1 = a′, p1q4 −p4q1 = b + b′,
p2q3 −p3q2 = b′ −b, p2q4 −p4q2 = c′, p3q4 −p4q3 = c.
All these difﬁculties motivate my decision not to explain Gauss’s theory of how
two forms are composed, but I do note that in fact the deﬁnition of the composite of
the form 2x2 +2xy +3y2 with itself is x2+5y2. This goes a long way to explaining
what Fermat had noticed about the divisors of x2 + 5y2.
Exercise. Derive Brahmagupta’s identity (B.2) by writing
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = (1/a)(A + iRy)(A −iRy),
where A = ax + by and R2 = ac −b2, and
a′u2 + 2b′uv + c′v2 = (1/a′)(A′ + iRv)(A′ −iRv),
where A′ = a′u + b′v and R2 = a′c′ −b′2, and multiplying out. This generalises
the strategy at the start of this section.
B.3
Dirichlet on Composition of Forms
Smith’s account of Dirichlet’s method of composition of forms is very helpful.4 To
compose two forms with the same discriminant D, say
ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 and a′x2 + 2b′xy + c′y2,
4See (Smith 1859, §111). Dirichlet’s account was originally a short, Latin, academic dissertation,
later published in Crelle’s Journal in 1851.

326
B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
Dirichlet chose two representable numbers M and M′, both prime to 2D, such that
am2 + 2bmn + cn2 = M and a′m′2 + 2b′m′n′ + c′n′2 = M′,
and two numbers ω and ω′ such that
ω2 ≡D mod M and ω′2 ≡D mod M′.
This allowed him to observe that ax2+2bxy+cy2 was equivalent to Mx2+2ωxy+
ω2−D
M
and a′x2 + 2b′xy + c′y2 was equivalent to M′x2 + 2ω′xy + ω′2−D′
M′
. So now
he investigated when these forms can be combined.
If it is possible to ﬁnd a number Ω such that
Ω ≡ω mod M, Ω ≡ω′ mod M′, and Ω2 ≡D mod MM′
then the composite can be deﬁned as
MM′x2 + 2Ωxy + Ω2 −D
MM′ y2.
There is such an Ω, moreover, if the values of M and M′ are suitably chosen. The
result is that equivalence classes of forms of the same discriminant can always be
deﬁned (the resulting equivalence class is well-deﬁned and independent of all the
choices made). So, to reiterate, equivalence classes of quadratic form s form a group,
but the calculation of the composite still depends on making certain choices.
It is instructive to compute the Dirichlet composite of the form 2x2 + 2xy + 3y2
with itself. We write the form in the form (2, 1, 3). When we try to use only the
second stage of Dirichlet’s procedure, we have to try to solve the congruence Ω2 ≡
−5 mod 4, which has no solutions. We therefore go back to the start, and transform
one of the forms into a more appropriate form. With m = 0 and n = 1 we get
M = 3 and we replace (2, 1, 3) with (3, 1, 2). The composite of this with (2, 1, 3)
is found by solving the congruences
Ω ≡1 mod 3, Ω ≡1 mod 2, and Ω2 ≡−5 mod 6,
for which the solution is Ω = 1. The resulting form is (6, 1, 1), which is equivalent
to (1, 0, 5), as we expected.
Exercise. Consider the forms that Legendre attempted to compose, and the ones
that must also be considered because they complete the list of positive forms of
discriminant b2 −ac = −41. They are
A = x2 + 41y2, or (1, 0, 41)
B = 2x2 + 2xy + 21y2, or (2, 1, 21)

B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
327
C+ = 5x2 + 4xy + 9y2, or (5, 2, 9)
C−= 5x2 −4xy + 9y2, or (5, −2, 9)
D+ = 3x2 + 2xy + 14y2, or (3, 1, 14)
D−= 3x2 −2xy + 14y2, or (3, −1, 14)
E+ = 6x2 + 2xy + 7y2, or (6, 1, 7)
E−= 6x2 −2xy + 7y2, or (6, −1, 7).
In each case they are ready to be composed. One has to ﬁnd Ω and then reduce
the resulting form to one of these eight reduced forms. For example, to compose C+
and D+ we have to solve the congruences
Ω ≡2 mod 5, Ω ≡1 mod 6, and Ω2 ≡−41 mod 15.
The solution is Ω = 7, so the composite is CD = (17, 7, 6) or 15x2 + 14xy + 6y2.
This reduces to (6, −1, 7), which is E−.
1. Check that the composite C+E−is equivalent to D−.
2. Compute enough composites to be sure you are comfortable with the procedure.
3. What is the group these eight reduced forms make up? [Hint: it is enough to
compute the squares, AA, BB etc.]
As we have seen, Legendre came close to deﬁning a useful concept of compo-
sition that met the above requirements. But it was subtly ﬂawed, as we shall now
see, following the discussion in Cox (1989, p. 42) of a passage in Legendre’s Essai
sur la théorie des nombres, vol. II, pp. 39–40. Legendre regarded the following ﬁve
forms of discriminant −41 as the reduced forms5:
A = x2 + 41y2
B = 2x2 + 2xy + 21y2
C = 5x2 + 4xy + 9y2
D = 3x2 + 2xy + 14y2
E = 6x2 + 2xy + 7y2
He then worked through his method for ﬁnding composites, and came up with these
results:
AA = A, AB = B, AC = C, AD = D, AE = E,
5This deﬁnition of C replaces the one given by Cox, C = 5x2 + 6xy + 10y2, which is not reduced
and reduces to 5x2 −4xy + 10y2.

Gauss and Composition of Forms
BB = A, BC = C, BD = E, BE = D,
CC = A or B, CD = D or E, CE = D or E,
DD = A or C, DE = B or C,
EE = A or C.
Cox observes that the ambiguity must be resolved before there is any hope of
these forms forming a group. This was not a problem for Legendre, who did not have
that idea, but it was for Gauss. It is exacerbated by the fact that Legendre’s concept
of equivalence is not that of proper equivalence, so some ambiguities of sign are
inevitable. With proper equivalence there are eight inequivalent reduced forms, not
ﬁve, because each of C, D, and E splits into two (in each case the corresponding
value of 2b, the coefﬁcient of xy, may be replaced by its negative).

Kummer’s Observations
Kummer published two major papers on his ideal numbers in 1847. While they will
not be discussed, the following remarks in the shorter of those papers on the use
of ideals and complex numbers in arithmetic are interesting. They provide evidence
that Gauss’s composition of forms was found to be very difﬁcult, and they suggest
that another approach might work. But we must be careful: Kummer’s ideas about
ideals are not the same as Dedekind’s later ideas, and Kummer was not claiming that
his work has resolved, or reformulated Gauss’s theory—only that perhaps it could.
The ideal factors of complex numbers enter, as shown, as factors of genuine complex
numbers; so ideal factors multiplied with suitable other ones must always give rise to
genuine complex numbers. Now this question of the connection between ideal factors
and genuine complex numbers is, as I shall show, using the results I have already
obtained, of great interest because it stands in close relationship with the most important
section of number theory. The two most important results concerning this question are the
following:
•
There is always a deﬁnite, ﬁnite number of ideal complex multipliers which are
necessary and sufﬁcient to make all possible ideal complex numbers into genuine ones;
•
Every ideal complex number has the property that a deﬁnite integer power of it makes a
genuine complex number.
I shall now go into a more detailed investigation of these two theorems. Two ideal complex
numbers that, multiplied by one and the same ideal number, give the same genuine complex
number I call equivalent or say belong to the same class because the investigation into
genuine and ideal complex numbers is identical with the classiﬁcation of certain compound
forms of degree λ −1 in λ −1 variables, concerning which Dirichlet has found the
principal result, although he has not yet published it, so that I do not exactly know if his
principle of classiﬁcation coincides with this, drawn from the theory of complex numbers.
As a particular case the theory of forms of degree two in two variables, albeit only in the
case when the determinant λ is a prime number, is comprehended in these researches, and

B
Gauss and Composition of Forms
329
here our classiﬁcation agrees with Gauss’s and not with Legendre’s. This sheds a bright
light on Gauss’s classiﬁcation of forms of the second degree and on the true basis for the
distinction between proper and improper equivalence, which it cannot be denied enters in
the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in a seemingly inappropriate way. If indeed two forms, such
as ax2 +2bx +cy2 and as ax2 −2bx +cy2, or as ax2 +2bx +cy2 and as cx2 +2bx +ay2,
are to be considered as belonging to different classes when in truth an essential difference
between these two is not to be found, and yet on the other hand the Gaussian classiﬁcation
must be recognised as mostly corresponding to the nature of things; then one must if one
is to take ax2 + 2bx + cy2 and as ax2 −2bx + cy2 merely as representative of two other,
entirely distinct ideas in number theory. But in truth these are nothing other that two distinct
ideal factors belonging to one and the same number.
The entire theory of forms of the second degree in two variables can indeed be presented
as the theory of complex numbers of the form x + y
√
D and then necessarily leads to
ideal complex numbers of the same kind. These are classiﬁed in just the same way as ideal
multipliers which are necessary and sufﬁcient to make genuine complex numbers of the
form x + y
√
D. These coinciding with the Gaussian classiﬁcation, this opens up the true
basis for them.
The general study of ideal complex numbers has the closest analogy with Gauss’s very
difﬁcult section on the composition of forms [which we discuss below], and the principal
result, which Gauss proved for these forms on §§291 et seq. also holds for the composition
of general ideal complex numbers. Here, to each class of ideal numbers there belongs
another class that, multiplied by this one, brings about a genuine complex number (the
genuine complex numbers are here the analogue of the principal class). Here there are
also classes that, multiplied by themselves, give genuine complex numbers (the principal
class) – thus, the class anceps. If one takes an ideal class f (α) and raises it to powers one
always ﬁnds, by the second of the results above, a power which makes it a genuine complex
number; if h is the smallest number for which f (α)h is a genuine complex number the
f (α), f (α)2, f (α)3 , . . . f(α)h all belong to different classes.
At this point, said Kummer, he declined to go further into the domain of complex
numbers. He would not attempt to ﬁnd the true number of classes because he had
been told that Dirichlet had already done this using similar principles. Instead, he
brought this paper to a close with a short paragraph about cyclotomy.

Appendix C
Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs
of Quadratic Reciprocity
The proofs are interesting because they draw on the theory of cyclotomy.
C.1
Gauss’s Fourth Proof
In the survey of Gauss’s proofs of quadratic reciprocity it would have been best to
include his fourth proof (for reasons which I shall give shortly). Unfortunately, the
original version, which he discovered in 1805 and published in 1811, is long and, if
only for that reason, difﬁcult to follow, although it has been translated into English
(see Nagell 1951, pp. 74–80), so we shall have to content ourselves with a brief
summary. I have chosen the one in Lemmermeyer (2000, pp. 95–97).
The proof is worth including because it too connects to the theory of cyclotomy
and because it proved to be inﬂuential. Fix an odd prime p and let ζ = e2πi/p.
It is trivial that p−1
k=0 ζ k = 0, but Gauss was led to consider the quadratic sum
G = p−1
k=0 ζ k2. It is a matter of calculation that
G2 =
−1
p

p,
but Gauss wanted to evaluate G, and the determination of the sign of a square root
that bafﬂed Gauss from 1801, when he ﬁrst had the idea of the proof, to late in 1805
when he wrote to his friend Olbers (3 September 1805):
The determination of the sign of the root has vexed me for many years. This deﬁciency
overshadowed everything that I found; over the last four years, there was rarely a week that
I did not make one or another attempt, unsuccessfully, to untie the knot. Finally, a few days
ago, I succeeded – but not as a result of my search but rather, I should say, through the
mercy of God. As lightning strikes, the riddle has solved itself.

Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
Gauss was able to show that the positive square root was to be taken in each case:
τ =
 √p if p ≡1 mod 4
i√p if p ≡3 mod 4.
Gauss then deﬁned τm(k) = m−1
t=0 exp( 2πikt2
m
); note that τp(1) = τ. He then
showed that
τmn(k) = τm(an)τn(am).
So, if p and q are odd primes
τpq(1) = τp(q)τq(p) =
p
q
  q


τp(1)τq(1),
and the proof of quadratic reciprocity follows.
The day before Gauss made his celebrated discovery that the regular 17-gon is
constructible by straight edge and circle, he had already had an important insight
into the cyclotomic equation which he later described to a former student of his,
Christian Gerling (6 January 1819).
Already earlier I had found everything related to the separation of the roots of the equation
xp−1
x−1 into two groups on which the beautiful theorem in the D. A. on p. 637 depends, in the
winter of 1796 (during my ﬁrst semester in Göttingen), without having recorded the day.
By thinking with great effort about the relation of all the roots to each other with respect to
their arithmetic properties, I succeeded, while I was on a vacation in Braunschweig, on that
day (before I got out of bed) in seeing this relation with utmost clarity, so that I was able to
make on the spot the special application to the 17-gon and to verify it numerically (Gauss,
Werke X.1, 125; translation in (Frei 2006, 161)).
The theorem Gauss was referring to occurs in §357 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeti-
cae, where he shows how to use two (Gaussian) periods of the cyclotomic equation
to factorise it (four times) as
4(xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + 1) = G(x)2 −p∗H(x)2,
where G(x) and H(x) are polynomials with integer coefﬁcients and p∗= +p if
p is of the form 4n + 1 and p∗= −p if p is of the form 4n −1. In other words,
p∗=

−1
p

p. In the previous paragraph, §356, Gauss had already shown that the
periods are the roots of the polynomial x2+x + 1
4(1−p∗), which makes it clear that
another proof of quadratic reciprocity could be at hand. Indeed, he had mentioned
this result much earlier, in §124, when discussing the quadratic characters of +7
and −7.
In other words, the pth cyclotomic polynomial factorises as the difference or the
sum of two squares over the ﬁeld Q(√p∗) according as −1 is or is not a square
modulo p. Or, to be even more modern in our expression of the result, the ﬁeld

C
Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
333
Q(√p∗) is a subﬁeld of the cyclotomic ﬁeld Q(ζ), where ζ is a primitive pth root
of unity.
Here are two small examples of this factorisation.
•
When p = 5, G(x) = 2x2 + x + 2 and H(x) = x;
•
When p = 7, G(x) = 2x3 + x2 −x −2 and H(x) = x2 + x.
C.2
Gauss’s Sixth Proof
In this section I give an English translation of Gauss’s sixth proof of quadratic
reciprocity. The proof is not easy, and it is followed by a commentary that should
help. It is interesting because it illustrates how Gauss showed that ideas in one part
of mathematics are connected, often in mysterious ways, to ideas in other parts. It
is also interesting for the unusually personal introduction that Gauss gave to it. This
proof also uses quadratic sums, but avoids the difﬁcult determination of the sign.
From Gauss, ‘New proofs and extensions of the fundamental theorem in the
study of quadratic residues’, (1818b).
The fundamental theorem of quadratic residues, which belongs to one of the
most beautiful truths of higher arithmetic, is indeed easily found by induction but
it was only to be proved after extensive difﬁculties. In such research it is often to
be seen that the proofs of the simplest truths, which the researcher can certainly
discover by induction for himself, lie buried very deeply and can only be brought
to the light of day ﬁrst after many vain attempts and in a different way from the
one originally sought. Further, it not seldom appears that as soon as one way is
found many other ways are found that lead to the same goal, some shorter and
more direct, others at the same time coming from the side and proceeding on quite
different principles, so that between these and the preceding researches one can
scarcely conjecture any connection. Such a wonderful connection between hidden
truths give these considerations not only a certain appropriate richness, they should
be diligently researched and clearly presented because they not seldom lead to new
means and extensions of science.
Although the arithmetical theorem dealt with here has, by earlier efforts, been
provided with four entirely different proofs, and can seem to be completely ﬁnished,
I return here to some new observations and present two new proofs, which shed a
new light on these facts. The ﬁrst is in a certain way related to the third, because it
derives from the same lemma, but later it takes a new path so that it can with justice
be counted as a new proof that does not coincide with the third and should not be
considered inferior. But the sixth proof calls upon a completely different and most
subtle principle, and gives a new example of the wonderful connection between
arithmetic truths that at ﬁrst glance seem to lie very far from one another. These
two proofs provide us with a new and very simple algorithm for deciding if a given
integer is a quadratic residue or nonresidue of a given prime number.

334
C
Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
Still another reason was provided, which led me to publish a new proof now
that I had already spoken of 9 years earlier. In fact, as I was occupied in 1805 with
the theory of cubic and biquadratic residues, where a very difﬁcult circumstance
that I had begun to work through, happened to draw on almost the same skill as
originally in the theory of quadratic residues. Without further notice, indeed, were
those theorems—which had handled those questions completely, and had presented
a wonderful analogy with the corresponding theorems about quadratic residues—
found by induction as soon as they were only sought for in a proper way, and all
remaining researches led on all sides to a complete proof that for a long time I had
sought in vain. This was indeed the impulse that I so much sought to add more and
more proofs of the already-known theorems on quadratic residues, in the hope that
from these many different methods, one or another could illuminate something in
the related circumstances. This hope was in no way idle, and untiring efforts were
ﬁnally crowned with success. Shortly, I will be in a position to publish the fruits of
my studies, but before I undertake that difﬁcult work I have decided to return once
more to the theory of quadratic residues, and to say what is still to be said, and so in
a certain sense to bid farewell to this part of the higher arithmetic.
Gauss’s Sixth Proof of Quadratic Reciprocity
§1
Theorem. 1. Let p denote a positive odd prime number, n a positive integer not
divisible by p, x an indeﬁnite quantity, then the function
1 + xn + x2n + · · · + xn(p−1)
is divisible by the function
1 + x + x2 + · · · + xp−1.
Proof. Let g be a positive integer such that gn ≡1(p) and suppose gn = 1 + hp,
then
1 + xn + x2n + · · · + xn(p−1)
1 + x + x2 + · · · + xp−1
= (1 −xnp)(1 −x)
(1 −xn)(1 −xp)
= (1 −xnp)(1 −xgn −x + xhp+1)
(1 −xn)(1 −xp)
= 1 −xnp
1 −xp .1 −xgn
1 −xn −x(1 −xnp)
1 −xn
.1 −xhn
1 −xp ,
which is obviously an integral function. Q.E.D.

Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
335
So every integral function of x that is divisible by 1−xnp
1−xn is divisible by 1−xp
1−x .
§2
Let α denote a positive primitive root for the modulus p, i.e. let α be a pos-
itive integer with the property that the smallest positive residues of the powers
1, α, α2, . . . αp−2 modulo p are, ignoring the sequence in which they occur,
identical with the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . ., p −1. Further, denote by f (x) the function
x + xα + xα2 + · · · + xαp−2 + 1,
so obviously
f (x) −1 −x −x2 −· · · −xp−1
will be divisible by 1 −xp and a fortiori it will also be divisible by 1−xp
1−x = 1 + x +
x2 + · · · + xp−1; so f (x) will also be divisible by this last function. But it follows
from this, if x represents an indeﬁnite quantity, that also f (xn) is divisible by 1−xnp
1−xn
and (by the previous paragraph) by 1−xp
1−x , at least whenever n is an integer that is
not divisible by p. If, however, n is divisible by p then each member of the function
f (xn) diminished by 1 will be divisible by 1 −xp, and in this case f (xn) −p will
be divisible by 1 −xp and therefore also by 1−xp
1−x .
§3
Theorem. 2. If one sets
x −xα + xα2 + · · · −xαp−2 = ξ,
then ξ2 ∓p will be divisible by 1−xp
1−x if one takes the upper sign whenever p is of
the form 4k + 1 and the lower sign whenever p is of the form 4k + 3.
Proof. It is easy to see that of the following p −1 functions,1 where 1 ≤j ≤p −1,

all is divisible by 1 −xp, which is:

= ξ2 −f (x2) + f (xα+1) −f (xα2+1) + · · · + f (xαp−2+1) = Ω.
So this expression Ω is also divisible by 1−xp
1−x . Now, among the exponents 2, α +
1, α2 + 1, . . . , αp−2 only one is divisible by p, namely α
1
2 (p−1) + 1, so, by the
previous paragraph, the following individual parts of the expression Ω
f (x2), f (xα+1), f (xα2+1), . . .
with the exception of the term f (x
1
2 α(p−1)+1) are divisible by 1−xp
1−x . One can
therefore set each term aside so that the function
ξ2 ∓f (x
1
2 α(p−1)+1)
remains divisible by 1−xp
1−x , where the upper or lower sign is chosen according as
p is of the form 4k + 1 or 4k + 3. And because moreover f (x
1
2 α(p−1)+1) −p is
divisible by 1−xp
1−x , so also ξ2 ∓p will be divisible by 1−xp
1−x , as was to be shown.
So that the double sign cannot have an ambiguous value, we will denote by ε
the number +1 or −1 according as p is of the form 4k + 1 or 4k + 3. Therefore
(1−x)(ξ2−εp)
1−xp
will be an integral function of x, which we shall denote by Z.
§4
Let q be a positive odd number and therefore 1
2(q −1) an integer. Then accordingly
(ξ2)
1
2 (q−1) −(εp)
1
2 (q−1) will be divisible by ξ2 −εp and therefore also by 1−xp
1−x . If
we set
ε

2 (q−1) = δ, and ξq−1 −δp
1
2(q−1) = 1 −xp
1 −x Y,
then Y will be an integer function of x and δ = +1 if either or both of p, q are of
the form 4k + 1, and with δ = −1 if both p, q are of the form 4k + 3.
§5
If we now assume that q is likewise a prime number (different from p), then, from
the theorem proved in the D.A. §51, we have that
ξq −(xq −xqα −xqα2 −· · · −xqαp−2)

C
Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
337
is divisible by q, or is of the form qX, where X is an integral function of
the numerical coefﬁcients of x (which is true of the other integral functions
Z, Y, W that are involved). If we denote the index of the number q with respect
to the modulus p and the primitive root α by μ, so q
≡αμ(mod p), then
the numbers q, qα, qα2, . . . , qαp−2 are congruent modulo p to the numbers
αμ, αμ+1, αμ+2, . . . , αp−2, 1, α, α2, . . . αμ−1, and therefore2 each of xqαj −xαμ+j ,
j = 0, 1, . . . , p −2 −μ, and each of xqαj −xαk, j = p −1 −μ, . . . p −2,
k = j −p + 1 + μ, is divisible by 1 −xp. If one takes these quantities apart from
their sign and adds them, it is clear that the function
xq −xqα −xqα2 −· · · −xqαp−2 ∓ξ
is divisible by 1 −xp and indeed the upper or lower sign is valid according as μ is
even or odd, i.e. according as q is a quadratic residue or nonresidue modulo p. If
we therefore set
xq −xqα −xqα2 −· · · −xqαp−2 −γ ξ = (1 −xp)W,
where γ = +1 or = −1 according as q is a quadratic residue or nonresidue modulo
p, then clearly W is an integral function.

After these preparations we derive from the combination of the preceding equations

We now assume that on dividing the function ξX by

the quotient is U and the remainder T , or
ξX = 1 −xp
1 −x U + T,
so that U, T are integral functions with respect to the numerical coefﬁcients and T
is of a lower degree than the divisor. ;Then it is the case that

and obviously this equation can hold only when the left and right sides both vanish.
For this, εp(δp

2 (q−1)−γ ) is divisible by q, as likewise is δp

2 (q−1)−γ , and because
δ2 = 1 the number p

2 (q−1) −γ δ is divisible by q.
If now we denote by β the positive or negative unit, according as p is a quadratic
residue or nonresidue modulo q, then p
1
2 (q−1) −β will be divisible by q and
therefore also β−γ δ; this can only happen when β = γ δ. From this the fundamental
theorem follows immediately. Indeed:
I: Whenever one, the other, or both of the numbers p, q are of the form 4k + 1
and therefore δ = +1 and so β = γ then so simultaneously is q a quadratic residue
for p and p a quadratic residue for q, or simultaneously q is a nonresidue for p and
p a nonresidue for q.
II: Whenever both numbers p, q are of the form 4k + 3 and therefore δ = −1,
then β = −γ and either simultaneously is q a quadratic residue for p and p a
nonresidue for q or simultaneously is q a nonresidue for p and p a residue for q.

Commentary
We proceed in two steps. First we introduce some ad hoc notation designed to make
Gauss’s argument easier to follow. Then we bring this notation into line with current
notation, so as to make the connection to quadratic reciprocity easier to see.
An Outline of Gauss’s Proof
Let us deﬁne
c(x) = 1 + x + x2 + · · · + xp−1 = 1 −xp
1 −x .
In §1 Gauss showed that
c(x)|c(xn).
In §2 he showed that
c(x)|f (x),
where
f (x) = 1 + x + xα + xα2 + · · · + xαp−2,

C
Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
339
and α is the smallest primitive root of p, and deduced that if p ∤n then c(xn)|f (xn),
but if p|n then c(x)|f (xn) −p.
In reading §3 it helps to note that ξ can be written as this function of x:
g(x) = 1 −xα + xα2 + · · · −xαp−2.
So the p −1 functions Gauss considered can be written as
xαj−1 
ξ −g(xαj−1)

.
This makes it easier to see what the sum of these expressions is and why c(x)|Ω.
Gauss then deduced that
c(x)|ξ2 ∓f (xα
1
2 (p−1)+1).
In §4 Gauss introduced the odd number q, and in §5 he set q ≡αμ (mod p),
considered ξq −g(xq) and observed that 1 −xp divides xqαj −xαp+j for j =
0, 1, 2, . . ., p −2. From this he deduced that
1 −xp|g(xq) ∓xi
with the rule for the sign being that the minus sign is taken if and only if μ is even.
So he wrote
g(xq) −γ ξ = (1 −xp)W,
where γ is +1 if q is a quadratic residue modulo p and −1 otherwise.
Finally, in §6 let us set A = δp
1
2 (q−1) −γ , so the ﬁrst equation becomes
qξX = εpA + c(x)

ZA + Yξ2 −Wξ(1 −x)

,
which Gauss rewrote, using ξX = c(x)U + T , as
qT −εpA = c(x)

ZA + Yξ2 −W(1 −x) −qU

.
For both sides to vanish it is necessary that q|εpA and therefore that q|A, and
therefore that
q|p
1
2 (q−1) −γ δ.

Gauss’s Fourth and Sixth Proofs of Quadratic Reciprocity
Moving Towards Modern Notation
The ﬁrst thing to notice is an implication of the use of the primitive root. It is clear
that the residues of the form α2k are squares mod p and the residues of the form
α2k+1 are nonresidues. So we can rewrite
ξ = g(x) = 1 −xα + xα2 + · · · −xαp−2
as
g(x) = 1 −

p

xα +
 2
p

xα2 + · · · +
p −2

Similarly, we can write
g(xj) = 1 −xjα + xjα2 + · · · −xjαp−2
so
g(xj) = 1 −

p

xα +
2j
p

xα2 + · · · +
j(p −2)
p

xαp−2
.
Now in any case c(x) divides f (xα
1
2 (p−1)+1) −p (by §1), so once Gauss
deduced that c(x) divides ξ2 ± f (xα
1
2 (p−1)+1) if follows that c(x) divides ξ2 ± p.
Furthermore, if p = 4k + 1 then α
1
2 (p−1)+1 = α2k+1, and if p = 4k + 3 then
α
1
2(p−1)+1 = α2k+2, so in §3 Gauss showed that c(x) divides ξ2 −p if p = 4k + 1
and c(x) divides ξ2 + p if p = 4k + 3. So in the ﬁrst case +p is a square modulo
c(x), and in the second case −p is a square modulo c(x). Notice that the rule for ε
means that ε =

−1
p

.
It will help to put a modern gloss on this. We can follow what Gauss did by
working in the ring Z[x]. We need to know, what is certainly the case, that an
integer that is prime in Z remains prime in this ring, and that when p is a prime the
polynomial c(x) is irreducible, so the quotient Q[x]/⟨c(x)⟩is a ﬁeld, and we have
just seen that Gauss proved that ±p are squares in this ﬁeld, so the ﬁelds Q(√±p)
are subﬁelds of the cyclotomic ﬁeld Q(ζ), where ζ = e2πi/p is a primitive pth root
of unity.
It remains to see how this helps to prove quadratic reciprocity. The ﬁrst clue, in
§4, is that δ = 1 if either or both of p, q are of the form 4k + 1 and δ = −1 if both
p and q are of the form 4k −1. So, δ = (−1)

2 (q−1), and if we knew that
quadratic reciprocity was true, we would know that δ =

Jordan, Preface to the Traité
The problem of the algebraic solution of equations is one of the ﬁrst that imposed
itself on the research of mathematicians. From the beginnings of modern algebra,
several procedures have been proposed for solving equations of the ﬁrst four
degrees: but these diverse methods, isolated one from another and founded on
artiﬁces of calculation, constituted facts rather than a theory until the day when
Lagrange submitted them to a profound analysis, found the common foundation on
which each rested and reduced each to a truly analytic method, taking as his starting
point the theory of substitutions.
The failure of Lagrange’s method for equations of degree greater than four gave
rise to the belief that it was impossible to solve them by radicals. In fact, Abel
proved this fundamental proposition; then, studying the particular equations that are
susceptible to this method of resolution obtained the remarkable class of equations
that bear his name. He undertook this work with great enthusiasm until death struck
him down; the fragments which he left to us allow us to judge the importance of his
unﬁnished ediﬁce.
These beautiful results were, however, only the prelude to a great discovery.
It was reserved to Galois to place the theory of equations on its deﬁnitive base,
by showing that to each equation there corresponded a group of substitutions, in
which its essential characteristics are reﬂected, notably all those that deal with its
resolution by means of other, auxiliary, equations. According to this principle, being
given an arbitrary equation it sufﬁces to know one of its characteristic properties to
determine its group, from which, reciprocally one deduces its other properties.
From this elevated point of view, the problem of the solution by radicals, which
yesterday seemed to form the sole object of the theory of equations, appears as only
the ﬁrst link in a long chain of questions relative to the transformation of irrationals
and their classiﬁcation. Galois, applying his general methods to this particular
problem, found without difﬁculty the characteristic property of the groups of

equations that are solvable by radicals, the explicit form of the groups of equations
of prime degree, and two important theorems relative to the case of composite
degrees. But in the preparation of his publications he left several fundamental
propositions without proof. M. Betti did not delay in ﬁlling in this gap with an
important memoir, where the complete series of Galois’s theorems was established
rigorously for the ﬁrst time.
The study of the division of the transcendental functions offered Galois a new and
brilliant application of his method. A long time before, Gauss had proved that the
equations for the division of the circle are solvable by radicals; Abel had established
the same result for the division equations of elliptic functions, supposing that the
division of the periods had been carried out, a proposition that M. Hermite was to
extend to abelian functions. But it remained to study the modular equations on which
the division of the periods depends. Galois determined their groups and remarked
that those of degrees 6, 8, or 12 can be reduced by a degree. M. Hermite, carrying
out this reduction, showed that it is enough to solve the equations of the ﬁrst four
degrees to identify the reduced equation obtained in the case of quinquisection with
the general equation of the ﬁfth degree, which furnishes a solution of the latter
equation by means of elliptic functions. M. Kronecker came at the same time to
the same result by almost the inverse method, which M. Brioschi then took up and
developed in some remarkable pages.
Another fertile path was opened to analysts by the celebrated memoirs of M.
Hesse on the inﬂection points of curves of the third order. In fact, the problems of
analytic geometry provide a slew of other remarkable equations whose properties,
studied by the most famous geometers, principally MM. Cayley, Clebsch, Hesse,
Kummer, Salmon, Steiner, are well known today and to which the methods of Galois
can be applied without difﬁculty.
The theory of substitutions, which thus became the foundation of all questions
about equations, is still only a little advanced. Lagrange only made it open; Cayley
attacked it on several occasions. MM. Bertrand, Brioschi, Hermite, Kronecker, J.-
A. Serret, E. Mathieu have alike been occupied; but, despite the importance of their
work, the question, as advanced as it is difﬁcult, remains today still almost intact.
Three fundamental notions have however begun to emerge: that of primitivity, which
as already indicated was found in the works of Gauss and Abel; that of transitivity,
which belongs to Cayley; and ﬁnally the distinction between simple and compound
group. It is to Galois that this last notion, the most important of them all, is due.
The purpose of this work is to develop the methods of Galois and to constitute
them into a body of doctrine by showing how easily they allow us to solve all the
principal problems in the theory of equations. To make them more readily known,
we have taken the elements as our point of departure, and we have expounded,
as well as our own research, all the principal results obtained by the geometers
who have preceded us. But we have often modiﬁed quite profoundly the statement
of these propositions and their method of proof, while deriving everything from
uniform principles that are as general as possible. The abundance of material has
constrained us, besides, to suppress all historical development. This is why we have
left on one side, not without regret, the celebrated demonstration given by Abel

D
From Jordan’s Traité
345
of the impossibility of solving the ﬁfth degree equation by radicals, this beautiful
theorem that can be established today by much simpler considerations.
Among the works that we have consulted, we must cite, in particular, besides
the Works of Galois, to which all this is only a commentary, the Cours d’Algèbre
Supérieure of M. J.-A. Serret. It is the assiduous reading of this book which
introduced us to algebra and inspired in us the desire to contribute to its progress.
We must equally thank here MM. Clebsch and Kronecker for the precious
information that they provided us. It is thanks to the liberal communications of
M. Clebsch that we could tackle the geometrical problems in Book III, Chapter III,
the study of the groups of Steiner, and the trisection of hyperelliptic functions. We
owe to M. Kronecker the notion of the group of the division equation of the latter
functions. We would have liked to draw more than we have done from the works
of this illustrious author concerning these equations. Several causes prevented us:
the thoroughly arithmetic nature of the methods, so different from our own; the
difﬁculty in reconstructing whole a sequence of demonstrations that most often are
barely indicated; ﬁnally the hope to see one day grouped into a consecutive and
complete body of doctrine these beautiful theorems that presently are the envy and
the despair of geometers.
This Work is divided into four Books:
The ﬁrst book is devoted to indispensable notions in the theory of congruences;
Book II is divided into two Chapters, the ﬁrst devoted to the study of substitutions
in general, the second to those substitutions deﬁned analytically and principally to
linear substitutions.
Book III has four Chapters. In the ﬁrst, we state the principles of the general the-
ory of equations. The following three contain applications to algebra, to geometry,
and to the theory of transcendentals.
Finally, in Book IV, divided into seven Chapters, we determine the various types
of equations solvable by radicals, and we obtain for these types a complete system
of classiﬁcation.

Jordan, General Theory of Irrationals
Introduction
What follows is a fairly literal translation of Book III, Chapter 1 of Jordan’s Traité
of 1870, the part where he introduced his version of Galois theory. The intention is
to make an accurate impression of this very important work available to an English
audience. Three more technical passages are presently omitted.
I have kept the word ‘substitution’, where I could have used the word ‘element’,
because it reminds us that the groups involved act by permuting roots of an
equation. But I replaced the phrase that a subgroup ‘commutes with all the
elements’ of a group with the modern term ‘normal subgroup’, leaving ‘normal’ in

346
D
From Jordan’s Traité
inverted commas to signal that I have introduced this word. Jordan’s long sentences
and nineteenth-century constructions have been intermittently modernised when I
thought it helped.
A number of more modern turns of phrase have, however, been avoided.
Quantities are called ‘functions’ that might have been called ‘expressions’; a
quantity is ‘rationally expressible’ if it is a member of the base ﬁeld, which is usually
the rational ﬁeld enlarged, perhaps, by some roots of unity.
The notation is almost entirely Jordan’s, but I could not write I for a subgroup
and turned therefore to K, and I replaced expressions like 1 · 2 · · · m by m!. Set-
theoretic notation and phrases were not introduced into mathematics until later and
they have been avoided here. I chose not to replace Jordan’s slightly cumbersome
presentation of cosets by a modern one in order to keep closer to the historical
ﬂavour of the original.
Jordan numbered his theorems and corollaries in roman; the arabic numbering
is provided by TEX. Otherwise I have tried to follow the layout of the original,
including the use of italics.
§348 Let F(x) = 0 be an arbitrary algebraic equation of degree m. It will have m
roots: and one knows that every symmetric function of these roots can be written
rationally in terms of the coefﬁcients of the equation.
In general these functions are the only ones that enjoy this property. Suppose in
fact that one has ϕ = ψ, ϕ being a non-symmetric function of the roots, and ψ a
rational function of the coefﬁcients. Let us replace in ψ each of the coefﬁcients by its
value as a function of the roots; the equation ϕ = ψ will become a relation between
these roots, a relation that cannot reduce to an identity because the second member
is symmetric and the ﬁrst is not. But one cannot admit that there is in general and
of necessity any relation of this kind between the roots: because one can create an
equation of degree m having as its m roots entirely arbitrary quantities x1, . . . , xm.
It is therefore only in certain particular cases that such relations can exist between
the roots that a non-symmetric function of these roots is expressible by means of the
coefﬁcients.
But one can generalise the problem and look for what are, for every given
equation F(x) = 0, the functions of the roots that are capable of being expressed
rationally as a function of the coefﬁcients and certain irrationals given arbitrarily a
priori, irrationals that we will call adjoined to the equation.
We consider as rational nonetheless every quantity expressible rationally by
means of the coefﬁcients of the equation and the adjoined quantities.
An equation with rational coefﬁcients is said to be irreducible when it has no
root in common with an equation of lower degree and rational coefﬁcients.
§349 Lemma I If one of the roots of an irreducible equation f (x) = 0 satisﬁes
another equation with rational coefﬁcients ϕ(x) = 0 then all its roots satisfy it.
In fact, let us look for the greatest common divisor of ϕ(x) and f (x); it cannot
reduce to a constant the equations ϕ(x) = 0 and f (x) = 0 having roots in common.
It will therefore be a function of x, ψ(x), and equating it to zero one will have an
equation whose roots evidently satisfy each of the two equations ϕ(x) = 0 and

D
From Jordan’s Traité
347
f (x) = 0. This last equation being irreducible, the degree of ψ(x) cannot be less
than that of f (x); therefore ψ(x) is equal to f (x) up to a constant factor.
Lemma 1 If all the roots of the equation ϕ(x) = 0 satisfy the equation f (x) = 0
then ϕ(x) will be an exact factor of f (x) up to a constant factor.
In fact, ϕ(x) is divisible by f (x) (Lemma I). If the quotient of this division does
not reduce to a constant, it will be divisible by f (x), etc.
§350 Lemma II Let F(x) = 0 be an equation all of whose roots x1, . . . xm are
distinct. One can ﬁnd a function V of these roots such that the m! expressions that
one obtains by permuting the roots in every possible way have distinct numerical
values.
In fact, let us set
V = M1x1 + M2x2 + · · · ,
M1, M2, . . . being undetermined integers. By equating arbitrarily two of the func-
tions that one obtains among them from V by substitutions of the roots, one obtains a
conditional equation that the M1, M2, . . . must satisfy. None of these equations is an
identity; because the coefﬁcients of M1, M2, . . . in each of them are the differences
of the roots x1, . . . xm which by hypothesis do not vanish. Moreover these equations
are ﬁnite in number. It is therefore easy to determine integers M1, M2, . . . in such a
way that they satisfy none of these equations.
In what follows we denote by V1 one of the values of the function V , chosen
arbitrarily; by Va, Vb, . . . the values which one deduces from it when one makes
substitutions represented by a, b, . . . between the roots.
§351 Lemma Let G be any group of substitutions between the roots x1, . . . , xm.
One can form a function of these roots the numerical value of which is unaltered by
the substitutions of G and changes with all other substitutions.
In fact, let 1, a, b, . . . be the substitutions of G. Let us set
W1 = (X −V1)(X −Va)(X −Vb) . . .,
X being an undetermined constant. A substitution of G, such as a, transforms W1
into
W1 = (X −Va)(X −Va2)(X −Vba) . . . = Wa;
but the substitutions of G, forming a group, are the same as a, a2, ba, . . . up to
order. The binomial factors that compose Wa are therefore the same, up to order,
as those that compose W1; this function is therefore not altered by the substitutions
of G.

348
D
From Jordan’s Traité
On the contrary, let α be a substitution foreign to this group, it transforms W1
into
W1 = (X −Vα)(X −Vaα)(X −Vbα) . . . = Wα.
The binomial factors that compose Wα being essentially different from those that
compose W1 these two expressions are not identical, and cannot take equal values
except for certain particular values of the quantity X that it will be easy to avoid.
§352 Lemma III The function V being chosen as in Lemma II, one can express
each of the roots x1, . . . , xm as a rational function of V and the coefﬁcients of F(x).
Let V1, . . . Vμ be the μ = (m −1)! values taken by V as one permutes the m −1
roots x2, . . . , xm without changing the position of x1. One can form an equation in
V of degree μ, namely
(V −V1)(V −V2) . . . (V −Vμ) = 0,
(D.1)
whose roots V1, V2, . . . are all distinct and of which the coefﬁcients, which are
symmetric functions of the roots x2, x3, . . . xm of the equation
F(x)
x −x1
= 0
are expressible rationally in the coefﬁcients of this equation, that is to say as a
function of x1 and the coefﬁcients of F(x). It follows that Eq. (D.1) can be put
in the form
f (V, x1) = 0,
f denoting a rational function of V and x1. Now, this equation is satisﬁed by V =
V1. One therefore has identically
f (V1, x1) = 0,
whence it follows that the equation
f (V1, x) = 0
will be satisﬁed by x = x1. Consequently the equations F(x) = 0 and f (V1, x) = 0
have a root in common, x1. On the other hand, the equations cannot have any other
root in common. For, if they had another, x2, the equation
f (V, x1) = 0

D
From Jordan’s Traité
349
will be satisﬁed by V = V1. Now this equation follows from the equation
f (V, x1) = m0, or (V −V1)(V −V2) . . . (V −Vμ) = 0
by changing x1 and x2 into each other. On the other hand by this exchange the
quantities V1, V2, . . . , Vμ change into others, V ′
1, V ′
2, . . . , V ′
μ all distinct from the
ﬁrst ones, by hypothesis; the equation f (V, x2) = 0 can therefore be put in the
form
(V −V ′
1)(V −V ′
2) . . . (V −V ′
μ) = 0,
and one sees that it cannot have V1 as a root.
The equations F(x) = 0 and f (V1, x) = 0 having only a single root in common,
one easily ﬁnds this root. To do this, one looks for the greatest common divisor of
F(x) and f (V1, x) and one continues this operation until one obtains a remainder of
degree one; in equating this remainder to zero one obtains an equation that reveals
the value of x1, and this value will evidently be rational in V1 because the operation
of greatest common divisor can never introduce radicals.
One can operate in the same way to ﬁnd the other roots, and one will thus obtain
rational expressions for all the roots, such as
x1 = ψ1(V1), x2 = ψ2(V1), . . . (∗).
§353 Lemma [Fundamental theorem, Theorem I] Let F(x) = 0 be an equation
with distinct roots x1, . . . , xm with certain auxiliary quantities y, z, . . . adjoined.
Then there is always a group of substitutions on the roots such that every function of
the roots that is numerically unaltered by the substitutions of this group is rationally
expressible and conversely.
Proof. Let V be a function of the roots altered by every substitution, and denote the
substitutions by 1, a, b, c, . . .. Then the quantity V1 is a root of the equation
(X −V1)(X −Va) . . . = 0,
whose coefﬁcients, being symmetric in the roots x1, . . . , xm, are rational. If this
equation is not irreducible the left-hand side will break into several irreducible
factors. Let Y = (X−V1)(X−Va) . . . be the one of these that vanishes for X = V1,
so V1 is a root of the irreducible equation Y = 0.
Then every function ϕ of the roots that is invariant under the substitutions
1, a, b, . . . is expressible rationally. For, each of the roots x1, . . . , xm being a rational
function of V1 and the coefﬁcients of F(x), ϕ itself will be a rational function of V1
and its coefﬁcients. Let ψ(V1) be this function. But these substitutions change V1
respectively into Va, Vb, . . . and do not change the coefﬁcients of F(x), so one will
have
ψ(V1) = ψ(Va) = ψ(Vb) = · · · = 1
μ(ψ(V1) + ψ(Va) + ψ(Vb) + · · · ),

350
D
From Jordan’s Traité
where μ is the degree of the polynomial Y. This function, being symmetric with
respect to the roots of the equation Y = 0, can be expressed rationally by the
coefﬁcients of this equation, which are themselves rational.
Conversely, every function expressible rationally is invariant under the substitu-
tions 1, a, b, . . .. Indeed, let ϕ = ψ(V1) be such a function. V1 satisﬁes the equation
ϕ = ψ(V1) which has rational coefﬁcients and so all the roots of the irreducible
equation Y = 0 must satisfy it. Therefore the function ψ(V1) does not alter when
V1 is replaced successively by Va, Vb, . . . which is the same as operating on the
roots x1, . . . , xm by the substitutions a, b, . . .,
§354 It only remains to show that the substitutions 1, a, b, . . . form a group, which
presents no difﬁculty.
The polynomial Y being a function of the indeterminate X, whose coefﬁcients
are rational, cannot alter under any of the substitutions 1, a, b, . . .. Let us apply, for
example, the substitution a. This polynomial becomes
(X −Va)(X −Va2)(X −Vab) . . . .
For this new polynomial to be identical with Y, whatever X is, it is necessary that
the quantities Va, Va2, Vab, . . . be no other than the quantities V1, Va, Vb, . . . up to
order. But by assumption two distinct substitutions give essentially different values
to the function V . It is therefore necessary that the substitutions a, a2, ab, . . . are
identical, up to order, with the substitutions 1, a, b, . . .. Thus, a and b being two
arbitrary substitutions in the sequence 1, a, b, . . ., the substitution ba must equally
belong to the sequence: the substitutions of this sequence therefore form a group.
§355 The group deﬁned by the preceding theorem can be called the group of the
equation relative to the adjoined quantities y, z, . . .. The group can vary according
to the nature of the adjoined quantities. Among all the groups that one can obtain
in this way, there is one particularly remarkable G and we can call it in an absolute
manner the group of the equation. It is the one obtained when no quantity at all is
adjoined.
This group contains all the others, for, if H is the group obtained by adjoining
the arbitrarily chosen quantities y, z, . . ., then a function invariant under the
substitutions of G and variable for all other substitutions is expressible rationally
before, and a fortiori after the adjunction of the y, z, . . .. Therefore it will be
unaltered under all the substitutions of H; therefore all these substitutions are
contained in G.
§356 Lemma If two functions ϕ1, ψ1 of the roots of the given equation are
numerically equal, the same equality will hold between the functions ϕa, ψa
obtained by applying to each of them an arbitrary substitution of G.
Proof. For, the function ϕ1 −ψ1, being zero, is expressible rationally, therefore it is
not altered by the substitution a, therefore ϕa −ψa = 0.

351
§357 Theorem II Every irreducible equation F(x) = 0 has a transitive group, and
conversely.
Proof. For, suppose that the group is not transitive. Let x1 be an arbitrary one of
the roots; x1, . . . , xm the roots with which it is permuted by the substitutions of G.
These substitutions do not alter the symmetric functions in x1, . . . , xm, therefore
these symmetric functions are rational. Therefore F(x) admits a rational divisor
(x −x1) . . . (x −xm).
Conversely, suppose that G is transitive, then F(x) cannot admit a rational
divisor such as (x −x1) . . . (x −xm). For, let xm+1 be a root of the equation
other than x1, . . . , xm. G has a substitution that replaces x1 by xm+1. It transforms
(x −x1) . . .(x −xm) into a new product different from this one because it admits the
factor (x −xm+1). Therefore the product (x −x1) . . . (x −xm) not being unaltered
by all the substitutions of G cannot be rational.
§358 Theorem III The order of the group of an irreducible equation of degree n
all of whose roots are rational function of one of them, is also n.
Proof. For, let x1, . . . , xn be the roots of the equation, V1 a function of these roots
that is altered by every substitution; it can be written as a function of x1 alone. Let
V1 = f (x1), this function satisﬁes an equation of degree n:
[V −f (x1)] . . .[V −f (xn)] = 0,
the coefﬁcients of which, being symmetric in x1, . . . , xn, are rational. Therefore the
order of the group of the equation (which is the degree of the irreducible equation of
which V1 is a root) cannot be greater than n. But on the other hand this group being
transitive its order is divisible by n; therefore it is equal to n.
§359 Theorem IV The group of the equation of degree mn obtained by eliminating
y between the equations
amym + · · · + a0 = 0,
and bn(y)xn + · · · + b0(y) = 0
is not primitive. Conversely, every equation whose group is not primitive results
from such an elimination.
Proof. Presently omitted.
§360 We shall say henceforth that an equation is primitive or not primitive,
simple or composed according as its group is primitive or not primitive, simple or
composed; the order of the equation and its composition factors are the order and
the composition factors of its group, two equations are isomorphic if their groups
are isomorphic, etc.
§361 The group of an equation being known, one can propose to reduce it
progressively by the successive adjunction of auxiliary quantities. With each of

352
D
From Jordan’s Traité
these adjunctions two cases can present themselves. If the irreducible equation
Y = 0 remains irreducible, it is clear that the group undergoes no change. If on the
contrary, thanks to the new adjunction, the polynomial (X−V1)(X−Va)(X−Vb) . . .
decomposes into simpler factors (X −V1)(X −Va), . . . , (X −Vb) . . .,, one ﬁnds a
new group H, smaller than G, and formed from only the substitutions 1, a, . . ..
We shall ﬁrst examine what happens when one adjoins to the given equation
certain functions of its roots; then we shall pass to the case where the adjoined
quantities are roots of other equations.
§362 Theorem V Let G be the group of the equation F(x) = 0, ϕ1 a rational
function of its roots. Deﬁne H1 to be the elements of G that do not alter the
numerical value of ϕ1, then (1) H1 is a subgroup of G and (2) adjoining the value
of ϕ1 reduces the group of the equation to H1.
Proof.
(1) In fact, let a and a1 be two substitutions of G that do not alter ϕ1: one has
ϕa = ϕ1, ϕa1 = ϕ1, from which one deduces (§356) that ϕa1a = ϕa = ϕ1. So
the substitution a1a does not alter ϕ1, which proves the ﬁrst of our propositions.
(2) Let us adjoin the value of ϕ1 to the equation. After this operation, the reduced
group of the equation can only contain substitutions that belonged initially to
G, and besides it can only contain substitutions that do not alter ϕ1, the value of
this quantity being supposed rationally known. Therefore all these substitutions
are contained in H1. Conversely, it contains all the substitutions of H1. In fact,
let a be one of the latter substitutions, ψ1 a function of the roots expressible
rationally as a function of φ1 and quantities already known, and let
ψ1 = χ(ϕ1),
χ denoting a rational function. From this equality one deduces the following
(§356): ψa = χ(ϕa), and as ϕa = ϕ1 it follows that ψa = ψ1. Thus every
rationally expressible function ψ1 is unaltered by the substitution a and this
substitution therefore belongs to the reduced group.
Lemma I The adjunction of several functions of the roots, ϕ1, ϕ′
1, . . . reduces the
group of the equation to a group H ′ formed of the substitutions that alter neither ϕ1
nor ϕ′
1, etc.
Lemma II Two functions ϕ1 and ψ1 invariant under the same elements of G are
expressible rationally in terms of each other.
Proof. For, on adjoining ϕ1 to the equation one reduces its group to those of its
substitutions that do not alter ϕ1; and ψ1, being invariant under these substitutions,
becomes rational.
[§§363, 364 show explicitly how to calculate ψ1 as a function of ϕ1, and are
presently omitted.]

§365 The method of calculation which we are going to expound is due originally
to Lagrange. It allows us to establish the following proposition:
Let F(x) = 0 be an algebraic equation, τ1 a function of its roots the algebraic
expression of which remains invariant under a certain group of substitutions
(1, a, b, . . .) and all the values which are algebraically distinct are also numerically
distinct. Then every function t1 of the roots xi which is unaltered algebraically by
the group (1, a, b, . . .) is a rational function of τ1 and the coefﬁcients of F(x).
Proof. For, let 1, a, b . . . ; β, aβ, bβ . . . ; γ, aγ, bγ . . . be the various possible sub-
stitutions possible among the roots, and let n be an arbitrary integer. The function
τ n
1 t1+τ n
βtβ +· · · = θ(n)
1
will be unaltered by every substitution and accordingly will
be expressible rationally as a function of the coefﬁcients. This done, t1 is expressed
rationally by [the explicit formula given at the end of §364].
Theorem VI With the same deﬁnitions as in Theorem V, let a0, a1, a2, . . . be
the substitutions of H1 (a0 reducing to 1), a0, a1, a2, . . .; a0b, a1b, a2b, . . .;
a0c, a1c, a2c, . . .; those of G. Then the equation
(Y −ϕ1)(Y −ϕb)(Y −ϕc) . . .
(D.2)
of degree equal to the ratio of the orders of G and H, will have rational coefﬁcients
and be irreducible.
Proof.
1: Let σ be an arbitrary substitution of G; it transforms the terms ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc into
each other (§§61 and 363). The coefﬁcients of Eq. (D.2), being symmetric in
ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc will therefore not be altered by σ, but σ is an arbitrary substitution in
G, therefore they are rational.
2: Equation (D.2) is irreducible, because if it had, for example, the factor
(Y −ϕ1)(Y −ϕb) this factor would be unaltered by the substitution c, but
this substitution transforms it into (Y −ϕc)(Y −ϕbc). For this to be unchanged,
Y remaining indeterminate, it must be the case that ϕc and ϕbc must be equal in
some order to ϕ1 and ϕb. Suppose, for example, that ϕc = ϕb. One concludes
that ϕcb−1 = ϕ1. Therefore cb−1 must be one of the substitutions a0, a1, a2, . . .
and c will be of the form aρb, which it is not.
§367 Remark: The substitutions of G that do not alter ϕ1 being a0, a1, a2, . . .,
those that do not alter ϕb will be b−1a0b, b−1a1b, b−1a2b, . . ., those which do not
alter ϕc will be c−1a0c, c−1a1c, c−1a2c, . . .; etc. For, let σ be a substitution of G
that does not alter ϕb, then one will have
ϕb = ϕbσ, whence ϕ1 = ϕbσb−1, whence bσb−1 = aρ, σ = b−1aρb.
§368 Theorem VII Adjoining ϕ1, ϕb, . . . , ϕc simultaneously reduces the group of
the equation to K, the largest subgroup of H1 that is ‘normal’ in G.

D
From Jordan’s Traité
Proof. In fact, the group is reduced to the substitutions common to the groups
H1 = (a0, a1, . . .), Hb = (b−1a0b, b−1a1b, . . .), Hc = (c−1a0c−1, −1a1c, . . .),
formed respectively by the substitutions that do not alter ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc, . . .. Now let
J be the group formed by these common substitutions, s an arbitrary one of the
substitutions, σ an arbitrary substitution of G. The substitution σ −1sσ will be
common to the transform of the groups H1, Hb, Hc, . . . by σ. But up to order these
transformed groups are identical with H1, Hb, Hc, . . ., for each of the substitutions
σ, bσ, cσ, . . ., belonging to G, can be put in one of the forms aρ, aρb, aρc, . . .. For
example, let bσ = aρd. The transform of the group Hb by σ will be composed of
the substitutions
σ −1b−1a0bσ = d−1a−1
ρ a0aρd, σ −1b−1a1bσ = d−1a−1
ρ a1aρd, . . . ,
which are none other than the substitutions of Hd. Therefore σ −1sσ belongs to J,
this group therefore commutes with σ, therefore it is contained in K.
Conversely, the group K being contained in H1, the transforms of its substitutions
by b, c, . . . will be contained in Hb, Hc, . . .. But these transforms reproduce, up to
order, the substitutions of K, therefore all the substitutions of K are common to
H1, Hb, Hc, . . ..
§369 Remark: In the particular case where the group H is already ‘normal’ in
G then H and its conjugates are not only equal but equal K, and the functions
ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc, . . ., invariant under the same substitutions of G, will be expressible ratio-
nally as functions of any one of them. Conversely, if the functions ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc, . . . are
expressible rationally as functions of any one of them, they will be invariant under
the same substitutions of G; one will therefore have H1 = Hb = Hc = . . . and this
group will be transformed into itself by all the substitutions of G
Theorem VIII Let the order of G be N, and the order of K be N
ν , then the order of
G′, the group of the Eq.(D.2), is ν.
Proof. In fact, set
W = M1ϕ1 + Mbϕb + Mcϕc + . . . ,
M1, Mb, Mc, . . . being undetermined constants. Then W will be a root of an
irreducible equation of degree equal to the order of the group of Eq. (D.2) (§353).
But on the other hand W can be considered as a function of the roots of the equation
R(x) = 0, which function, unaltered by the substitutions in K, is evidently altered
by every other substitution of G. It therefore depends on an irreducible equation
whose degree is equal to ν, the ratio of the orders of G and K.
Theorem IX If K′ is the largest ‘normal’ subgroup of G that contains K, then the
group G′ is simple, and conversely.

D
From Jordan’s Traité
355
Proof. For, if there is a ‘normal’ subgroup K′ in G′ let its order be ν′. A function
ψ of the roots of Eq. (D.2) unaltered by the substitutions of K′ and altered by
every other substitution will depend on an irreducible equation of degree ν
ν′ (§366),
therefore the roots will be rational functions of each other (§369). But ψ can be
considered as a function of the roots of F(x) = 0; let L be the group composed of
substitutions that do not alter it. Then (1) L contains K, because the substitutions,
which do not alter ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc . . . cannot alter ψ; (2) it will be larger, because its
order, being equal to that of G, divided by the degree ν
ν′ of the irreducible equation
upon which ψ depends, is equal to Nν′
ν , that of K being merely N
ν ; (3) ﬁnally,
the roots of the equation ψ being rational functions of each other, L is a ‘normal’
subgroup of G.
Theorem X Let F(x) = 0 be an equation whose group G is composite, and
G, H, H1, . . . a sequence of groups such that (1) each one is a ‘normal’ subgroup
of the one before and (2) that it is as general as possible among those that satisfy
this double property, and N, N
ν , N
νν1 , . . . are the respective orders of the groups. The
resolution of the given equation will depend on that of the successive equations and
contain ν, ν1, . . . substitutions respectively.
Proof. For, let ϕ1 be a function of the roots of the given equation that is unaltered
by the substitutions in H. It depends on an equation of degree ν (§366) the group of
which is simple (§371) and of order ν (§§369, 370). When this equation is solved,
the group of the given equation reduces to H. Now let ϕ′
1 be a function of the roots
of the given equation that is unaltered by the substitutions in H1. It depends on an
equation of degree ν1 (§366) the group of which is simple (§371) and of order ν1
(§§369, 370), etc.
This theorem shows that one can arrange the equations with composite groups
according to the number and value of their composition factors.
§373 Now suppose that one adjoins to the given equation F(x) = 0 one or more of
the roots of another equation f (x) = 0.
The case where one adjoins several functions χ1, χ′
1, . . . reduces to the case
where one adjoins only one: for, let G′ be the group of the equation f (z) = 0, H ′
1 the
group formed by those substitutions that alter none of the functions χ1, χ′
1, . . .; r1 a
function of z1, . . . , zn unaltered by the substitutions of H1 and varying under every
other substitution. The adjunction of χ1, χ′
1, . . . reduces the group of f (z) = 0 to
H ′
1, whose substitutions do not alter r1, this function being expressible rationally.
Conversely, the adjunction of r1 reduces this group to H ′
1, whose substitutions do
not alter χ1, χ′
1, . . ., these functions will become rational. Therefore every rational
function of r1 can be expressed rationally in terms of χ1, χ′
1, . . . and conversely.
Therefore it is indifferent to adjoin to an arbitrary equation either χ1, χ′
1, . . . or
simply r1.

356
D
From Jordan’s Traité
§374 Therefore let us adjoin to the equation F(x) = 0 the unique function r1; let
α0, α1, . . . be the substitutions of H ′
1; α0β, α1β, . . . ; α0γ, α1γ, . . . those of G′; r1
depends on the irreducible equation
(X −r1)(X −rβ)(X −rγ ) · · · = 0.
(D.3)
Let us suppose that the adjunction of r1 reduces the group of F(x)
=
0 to H1. Let, as before, a0, a1, . . . be the substitutions of this group,
a0, a1, . . . ; a0b, a1b, . . . ; a0c, a1c, . . . be those of G. Finally let ϕ1 be a function
of the roots of F(x) = 0 unaltered by the substitutions of H1 and altered by every
other substitution; it will satisfy the equation
(Y −ϕ1)(Y −ϕb)(Y −ϕc) . . . = 0.
(D.4)
But by hypothesis, ϕ1 is a rational function of r1, let ϕ1 = ψ(r1), then r1 will be a
root of the equation
(ψ(y) −ϕ1)(ψ(y) −ϕb)(ψ(y) −ϕc) . . . = 0.
(D.5)
But on the other hand r1 satisﬁes the irreducible equation (D.3). One of the roots
of that equation satisﬁes Eq. (D.5), therefore they all do (§349). Therefore the
quantities ψ(r1), ψ(rβ), ψ(rγ ), . . . all satisfy Eq. (D.4). But they satisfy equation
(Y −ψ(r1))(Y −ψ(rβ))(Y −ψ(rγ )) . . . = 0,
(D.6)
the coefﬁcients of which, being symmetric in r1, rβ, rγ , . . ., are rational.
The roots of Eq. (D.6) all satisfy the irreducible equation (D.4), the ﬁrst member
of (D.6) will be an exact power of the ﬁrst member of (D.4) (§349), up to a
constant factor which here reduces to unity, the two polynomials having unity for
the coefﬁcient of their ﬁrst term. Let μ be the degree of this power, the sequence of
terms ψ(r1), ψ(rβ), ψγ , . . . has μ terms equal to ϕ1, μ equal to ϕβ, etc.
This done, adjoining to the equation F(x) = 0 an arbitrary one of the roots of
Eq. (D.4), such as rβ, the group of the equation will reduce to H1, to the group Hb
derived from the substitutions (b−1a0b, b−1a1b, . . .) to the analogous group Hc, etc
according as ψ(rβ) is equal to ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc, . . ..1
In fact, for example let ψ(rβ) = ϕb. The adjunction of rβ making ϕb rational,
the reduced group H can contain only those substitutions of G that do not alter ϕb,
that is to say those of Hb. The number of these substitutions being equal to those in
H1, one sees that the order of H is at most equal to that of H1. Conversely, starting
from the rationality of the root rβ instead of that of r1 one sees that the order of H1
is at most equal to that of H. Therefore these orders are equal and H contains all
the substitutions of H1.

§375 Theorem XI In the notation of the preceding paragraph, if H ′
1 is a normal
subgroup of G′ then H1 is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof. In fact, H ′
1 being a ‘normal’ subgroup of G, the roots of the irreducible
equation (D.3) that depend on r1 are rational functions of each other (§369).
Therefore the functions ϕ1, ϕb, ϕc . . . are respectively rational functions of r1;
therefore they are unaltered by the substitutions of H1; but these are respectively
those of H1, Hb, Hc, . . .;, therefore these groups are identical and H1 is ‘normal’
in G.
§376 Theorem XII If one adjoins to the equation F(x) = 0, whose group is G,
all the roots of the equation f (z) = 0 then the reduced group H1 is a ‘normal’
subgroup of G.
Proof. For, adjoining all the roots of f (z) = 0 simultaneously is the same as
adjoining a function V1 of these roots that alters under every substitution other than
unity (§373). But then the group H ′
1 reduces to the single substitution 1, which is
evidently normal in G′, therefore H will be normal in G.
§377 Lemma If the group G is simple, it cannot be reduced by the resolution of an
auxiliary equation without reducing to the single substitution 1 (the group composed
of this substitution being, by deﬁnition, the only normal subgroup of G; in this case
the equation F(x) = 0 will be completely solved.
§378 Theorem XIII Let F(x) = 0 and f (z) = 0 be two equations whose groups
are of orders N and N′ respectively. If the resolution of the second equation reduces
the group of the ﬁrst to a group H1 containing no more than N
ν substitutions then
conversely the resolution of the ﬁrst equation reduces the group of the second to
a group H ′
1 containing no more that N′
ν substitutions. Moreover, the two equations
are composed with the same auxiliary equation F ′(u) = 0 of degree ν whose group
contains ν substitutions.
Proof. In fact, let ψ(x1, . . . , xm) be a function of the roots of F(x) = 0, unaltered
by only the substitutions of H1. It is rationally expressible as a function of the roots
z1, . . . , zn of f (z) = 0. One therefore has
ψ(x1, . . . , xm) = χ(z1, . . . , zn) = u.
This quantity ψ(x1, . . . , xm) depends on an auxiliary irreducible equation
f ′(u) = 0 of degree μ (§366). Moreover, H1 being ‘normal’ in G (§376), the roots
of this equation are rational functions of each other (§369) and its group contains
ν substitutions (§358). The solution of this auxiliary equation reduces the group of
F(x) = 0 to precisely the substitutions of H1, which are N
ν in number. It likewise
reduces the group of f (z) = 0 in such a way that it only contains N′
ν substitutions.
In fact, let K′ be the number of substitutions of the group G′ that do not alter
χ(z1, . . . , zn) = u; u will depend on an irreducible equation of degree N′
K′ . But
the degree of this equation is equal to ν, therefore N′
K′ = ν, whence K′ = M′
ν .

D
From Jordan’s Traité
The solution of the equation F(x) = 0 entailing that of the auxiliary equation
f ′(u) = 0, whose roots are rational functions of x1, . . . , xm, the group of f (z) = 0
will reduce in such a way that it contains at most N′
ν substitutions. On the other
hand, it cannot contain a smaller number, for the reduced group H ′
1 contains only
N′
μ substitutions, μ being a number greater than ν, one sees on repeating all the
arguments starting with the equation f (z) = 0 that the solution of this equation
would reduce the group of F(x) = 0 so that it contained at most N
μ substitutions, a
result contrary to our hypothesis. So the reduced group H1 contains N
ν substitutions.
§379 Lemma I If the group G of the equation F(x) = 0 is simple it can only be
solved by means of equations of which the order of the group is a multiple of the
order of G.
Proof. For, let us adjoin to this equation the roots of an auxiliary equation f (z) = 0.
If its group is reduced, it is reduced to the single substitution 1 (§377). Therefore
the order of the group of F(x) = 0, which was N, is reduced to 1 by the adjunction
of the roots of f (z) = 0. Therefore reciprocally the adjunction of the roots of
F(x) = 0 to the equation f (z) = 0 divides the order of this group by N. Therefore
its order is a multiple of N.
§380 Lemma II If the group G of the equation F(x) = 0 is reduced by the
resolution of a simple equation f (z) = 0 the roots of this last equation are rational
functions of x1, . . . , xn.
Proof. For, the resolution of F(x) = 0 reducing the group of f (z) = 0 (§378)
completely solves this last equation.
This proposition is an extension of a theorem of Abel’s: if an equation is solvable
by radicals, each of the radicals that appears in its resolution is a rational function
of the roots and the roots of unity.
§381 Remark If the function ψ(x1, . . . , xm) is altered by every substitution
operating on the roots x1, . . . , xm these roots are expressible rationally in terms of
ψ(x1, . . . , xm) (§352), and consequently as functions of z1, . . . , zn. The resolution
of the equation f (z) = 0 therefore implies the complete resolution of the equation
F(x) = 0. If at the same time χ(z1, . . . , zn) alters under every substitution acting
on the z1, . . . , zn, the resolution of F(x) = 0 entails that of f (z) = 0. The two
equations will be said to be equivalent.
Lemma 2 III Equivalent equations have the same orders.
Proof. In fact, let N be the order of the equation F(x) = 0, N′ that of the equation
f (z) = 0. The resolution of f (x) = 0 reduces the group of F(x) = 0 to the
single substitution 1, therefore the resolution of F(x) = 0 reduces the group of
f (x) = 0 to one containing no more than N′
N substitutions (§378). But the resolution
of F(x) = 0 entailing that of f (z) = 0 the group of this last equation reduces to the
single substitution 1. One must therefore have N′
N = 1, whence N = N′.

Lemma 3 IV Every adjunction of an auxiliary quantity which reduces the order of
one of these equations by dividing its order by ν reduces the order of the other by
the same amount.
Proof. In fact, the equations being equivalent before the adjunction and after, their
groups cannot cease to have the same number of substitutions.
Lemma 4 V Every equation equivalent to a composite equation is itself composed
of the same auxiliary equations.
§382 Problem Find all the irreducible equations equivalent to a given equation
F(x) = 0.
Let f (z) = 0 be one of these equations. The resolution of F(x) = 0 implying
that of f (z) = 0 the roots z1, . . . , zn of this last equation are rational functions of
x1, . . . , xm. Therefore let z1 = ϕ1: denote as before by G the group of F(x) = 0, by
a0, a1, . . . the substitutions of G that do not alter the function ϕ1, which substitutions
from a group H1, and by a0, a1, . . . ; a0b, a1b, . . .; a0c, a1c, . . . those of G. We have
seen (§366) that the irreducible equation on which ϕ1 depends is
(Z −ϕ1)(Z −ϕ2)(Z −ϕc) . . . = 0,
so the simultaneous adjunction of its roots reduces the group of the given equation to
1 (§368). But this adjunction must resolve the given equation completely; therefore
K reduces to the single substitution 1; whence the result:
For an irreducible equation f (z) = 0 to be equivalent to F(x) = 0 it is necessary
and sufﬁcient that (1) one if its roots, z1, be a rational function of the roots of
F(x) = 0; (2) that the group H1 formed by the substitutions of G [the group of
F(x) = 0] that do not alter this function contain no normal subgroup of G (except
that formed by the single substitution 1).
[§§383, 384, which are technical and contain a proof of theorem XIV, are
presently omitted.]
§385 Theorem XIV No irreducible equation of degree p a prime can be reduced
by means of auxiliary equations of lower degree.
Proof. For, the equation being irreducible, its group is transitive. Therefore its order
is divisible by p, and one sees from theorem XIII that it continues to be divisible by
p as long as one does not use an auxiliary equation whose order is divisible by p.
But the order of the group of an auxiliary equation of degree q < p is a divisor of
q!; it is therefore prime to p. Therefore the order of the group of the given equation
will remain divisible by p provided one only employs similar equations.
§386 Theorem XV The general equation of degree n cannot be solved by means
of equations of lower degree (except in the case when n = 4).
Proof. In fact, its group is of order n!. By resolving an equation of degree 2 one
can reduce to the alternating group whose order is n!
2 . But this new group is simple
(§85). Therefore the equation cannot be solved by means of an auxiliary equation

360
D
From Jordan’s Traité
unless the order of its group is at least equal to n!
2 , but if q is the degree of this
auxiliary equation, its order divides q!. Therefore q cannot be less than n.
§387 Let us consider on the contrary the fourth degree equation
x4 + px3 + qx2 + rx + s = 0.
Let x1, x2, x3, x4 be its roots; H the group of order 8 obtained from the substitutions
(x1, x2), (x3, x4), (x1, x3)(x2, x4). A function ϕ1 of the roots of the given equation
and invariant under the substitutions of H depends on an equation of the third
degree (§366). This solved, the group of the given equation reduces to a group K
obtained from those of its substitutions which are common to the group H and its
transforms by the various substitutions of G. One sees easily that these common
substitutions are the four obtained from (x1, x2)(x3, x4), (x1, x3)(x2, x4). But these
substitutions commute with the subgroup H ′ of order 2, obtained from the powers
of (x1, x2)(x3, x4). Therefore a function of the roots that is invariant under the
substitutions of H ′ only actually depends on an equation of the second degree.
This solved, the group of the given equation reduces to H ′. This equation then
decomposes into two equations of the second degree, having respectively for roots
x1, x2 and x3, x4 (§357). It is enough, moreover, to solve one of these equations to
reduce the group of the given equation to the identity.
Among the various functions that one can take for φ1, the most convenient is the
function (x1 +x2 −x3 −x4)2 adopted by Lagrange. One easily ﬁnds the coefﬁcients
of the equation of degree 3 on which it depends:
Y 3−(3p2−8q)Y 2+(3p4−16p2q +16q2+16pr −64s)Y −(p3−4pq +8r)2 = 0.
Let v1, v2, v3 be its roots, one has
x1 + x2 −x3 −x4 = √v1; x1 −x2 + x3 −x4 = √v2;
x1 −x2 −x3 + x4 = √v3; x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = −p;
whence
x1 = 1
4(−p + √v1 + √v2 + √v3), . . . .
One also has
√v1
√v2
√v3 = (x1 + x2 −x3 −x4)(x1 −x2 + x3 −x4)(x1 −x2 −x3 + x4)
= −p3 + 4pq −8r,

The other roots are obtained by changing the signs of the two independent
radicals √v1, √v2.
§388 To apply the preceding results, it is necessary to know how to determine the
group of a given equation.
The route to follow to deal with this question is this: 1) construct the various
groups of possible substitutions G, G′, . . . of the roots x1, . . . , xn of the equation;
2) let G be one of these groups, chosen arbitrarily: one will be assured that it does
or does not contain the group of the equation by forming a function ϕ of the roots
that is invariant under the substitutions of G and varies under any other substitution,
calculating by the method of symmetric functions the equation that has for its roots
the various values of ϕ, and examining whether this equation does or does not have
a rational root. Among the groups in the sequence G, G′, . . . which also contains
the group of the equation, the smallest will be the group itself.
This method, which is theoretically satisfactory, will be impracticable if one
wants to apply it to a numerical equation given at random. But the equations that
one meets in analysis always have special properties that allow us to determine their
group more easily, often from the coefﬁcients themselves. We shall give several
examples in the following chapters.

Jordan: The Quintic Is Not Solvable by Radicals
Jordan’s argument that the quintic is not solvable by radicals went as follows:
§517 An equation is said to solvable by radicals if its roots can be made rational
by the adjunction of the roots of a sequence of binomial equations.
One can suppose that the auxiliary binomial equations are all of prime degree;
for, the resolution of a binomial equation of degree pq evidently reduces to the
successive resolution of two binomial equations, of degrees p and q.
We call solvable groups those that characterise the equations that are solvable by
radicals.
§518 Theorem I Every abelian equation of prime degree is solvable by radicals.
In fact, let X be such an equation;
x0, x1 = ϕ(x0), . . . , xp−1 = ϕ(xp−2) = ϕp−1(x0)

From Jordan’s Traité
its roots, θ a pth root of unity, r an arbitrary integer: the function
ψ = [x0 + θrx1 + · · · + θ(p−1)rxp−1]p
is evidently unaltered by the substitution (x0, x1, . . . , xp−1), whose powers form the
group of X. It is therefore expressed rationally as a function of θ and the coefﬁcients
of X. One easily obtains its values on replacing x0, . . . , xp−1 by their values as a
function of x0, which reduces it to the form ψ(x0, θ). One therefore has the equality
ψ = ψ(x0, θ),
which is not affected if one performs on its two members one of the powers of the
substitution (x0, x1, . . . xp−1): one therefore has
ϕ = ψ(x0, θ) = ψ(x1θ) = · · · = ψ(x0, θ) + ψ(x1θ) + · · ·
p
= ur,
ur being a symmetric function of (x0, x1, . . . xp−1).
This function being calculated, it becomes
x0 + θrx1 + · · · + θ(p−1)rxp−1 =
p√ur.
Let us set successively r = 1, 2, . . . , p −1: one will have p −1 distinct linear
equations, which, together with this one:
x0 + x1 + · · · + xp−1 = P
(where P is the known function of the coefﬁcients of X that represents the sum of
the roots) allows us to determine all the roots.
To obtain xρ one adds these equation, multiplied respectively by θ ρ, θ−rρ, . . . , 1
then dividing by p it becomes
xρ = P + θ−ρ p√u1 + · · · + θ−rρ p√ur
p
.
This expression contains p −1 radicals of degree p; but these radicals are all
rational functions of a single one of them in such a way that the value of this
one being taken arbitrarily that of the others is completely determined. In fact, the

§519 Theorem II For an equation to be solvable by radicals, it is necessary and
sufﬁcient that its resolution reduces to that of a sequence of abelian equations of
prime degree.
This condition is necessary. For each of the binomial equations of prime degree
that arises in the resolution of the proposed equation can be resolved by means of
two successive abelian equations (§417) of which one is of prime degree. As for the
other, its resolution leads to that of a sequence of abelian equations of prime degree.
This condition is sufﬁcient: for, the abelian equations on which the resolution of
the proposed equation depends being solvable by radicals, the proposed equation
will be.
Here are two other statements of the same theorem.
§520 Theorem III For an equation to be solvable by radicals, it is necessary and
sufﬁcient that its composition factors all be prime.
For, let X be an equation solvable by radicals; G its group; N its order. Let us
successively adjoin the roots of the abelian equations that lead to its resolution; its
group reduces successively until it contains only the substitution 1. Let H, K, . . .
be the successive reduced groups; N
λ , N
λμ, . . . their orders; Z the abelian equation
of degree p such that the adjunction of its roots reduces the given group to H.
Reciprocally, the adjunction of the roots of X to the equation Z will reduce the
order of this group to this latter on dividing by λ (§378). But this order is equal to p
(§358); and for it to be divisible by λ it is necessary that λ = p. One sees likewise
that μ, . . . are all prime numbers. Moreover, the substitutions of G permute with
those of H, those of H with those of K, etc.2 Therefore λ, μ, . . . are composition
factors of G.
Reciprocally, if the equation X has composition factors λ, μ, . . . all prime let
G, H, K, . . . be successive groups of orders N, N
λ , N
λμ, . . . such that each one is
contained in the preceding one and commutes with its substitutions. A function of
the roots of X, invariant under the substitutions of H, depends on an equation Z of
degree λ and order λ (§366 and §370). But by hypothesis λ is prime; the group of
Z therefore reduces to powers of a cyclic substitution of order λ. This equation will
therefore be abelian and of prime degree. Finally its resolution will reduce the given
group to H.
This done, a function of the roots of the given equation that is invariant under the
substitutions of K will depend on an abelian equation of degree μ, whose resolution
will reduce the group of the given equation to K, etc.
2We would say that H was a normal subgroup of G.

Netto’s Review
Eugen Netto, a student of Kronecker’s in Berlin, reviewed Jordan’s book in the
abstracting journal of the day, the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik,
in these terms (you may want to consult the notes that follow at some points):
In this work Mr. C. Jordan presents the investigations on substitutions and algebraic
equations that have been previously described by him in this connection. The fact that some
works by German researchers in this ﬁeld are not used, he explains, partly by their aphoristic
form, partly by the variety of methods they used, and partly by the hope that one day it
will be possible that each complete theory can be brought fully to light. Several sections,
extracts, fragments and results of the work have previously appeared in various periodicals;
that so many are still being published, shows, of course, that the whole theory is not yet as
ﬁnished and complete, as the author would like: there are still many gaps left to ﬁll, some
arguments to shorten, some proofs to correct.
The great size of the book makes it impossible to enter into the minutest details here. We
must be content to follow the progress overall, and to highlight the main results.
In the ﬁrst book the basics of the theory of congruences is explained, and at the end
the Galois imaginaries that are expected to provide the solution to congruences of higher
degrees, are brieﬂy introduced.
The ﬁrst chapter of the second book deals with the elements of the theory of substitutions, in
particular substitution groups. In this connection, the words: “transitive”, “non-primitive”,
and “composite” are subjected to a closer examination.
[Netto then described Jordan’s deﬁnitions of linear, orthogonal, abelian, and hypo-abelian
groups.]
All these are analyzed and their order and composition factors determined. Furthermore, in
this chapter a canonical form for linear substitutions is given, as are explicit methods for
constructing special linear groups, for ﬁnding elements of each of the groups treated that
commute with each other, and a theory of linear fractional substitutions is described.
In the ﬁrst chapter of the third book the concept of group of an equation is established,
which brings together the theory of equations and that of substitutions, and which, for
example, reduces the solubility of algebraic equations to the composition of their groups.
By adjunction of certain irrationalities one can bring about a reduction of the equations,
and the detailed investigation of these relationships leads to the theorems on solvability of
equations, etc. The second chapter gives the theory of Abelian and Galois equations. The
ﬁrst are those in which all the roots can be expressed rationally in terms of any one of

D
From Jordan’s Traité
365
them, the latter those in which all can be expressed in terms of any two. The group of these
equations contains only substitutions that commute with each other; the binomial equations
form a particular case.
[(*))] The geometric applications in the third chapter refer to the inﬂection points of the
curves of the third degree; those third-order curves, whose intersection with a given curve of
fourth order coincide in fours; Kummer’s surface; the lines on a cubic surface; and contact
problems. The application to the theory of transcendents forms the content of the fourth
chapter. In it the circular, elliptic and hyperelliptic functions, the division of the periods,
the modular equations, etc. are discussed. In the part on “the solution of equations by
transcendents” we emphasize the following theorem, which is proved after an account of
the solution methods for the equations of the third, fourth, and ﬁfth degree. The resolution
of the general equation
X = xq + axq−1 + · · · = 0
will, after the adjunction numerical irrationalities that depend only on q, be reduced to the
equation which describes the twofold division of the periods of those hyperelliptic functions
in terms of √(X).
Galois showed that an irreducible equation of a prime degree is solvable if and only if its
group is linear. The construction of the group arises here that can be described without great
difﬁculty. This is different for equations of arbitrary degree.
Galois introduced a most important property of the groups of solvable equations (Traité IV
1: Theorem 4), but did not give the construction for them and said, by restricting himself to
primitive equations, that their degree can only be a prime power, a view Mr Jordan refuted
earlier when he showed that all solvable primitive equations of a degree are of only one
type.
In the ﬁrst chapter of the fourth book the author now gives other criteria for solvable groups,
in addition to the above-mentioned one due to Galois, and one of them is based on its
construction. This is carried out in the second chapter, and the problem for the general case
is reduced to a consideration of special cases. A general formula is not given but rather a
method, by means of which the problem for equations of higher degree is reduced to those
of much lower degree. The expressions for the substitutions of the desired groups contain
imaginary magnitudes, namely the roots of irreducible congruences of higher degrees.
However this is only apparent, although the transformation to a real form requires further
work. The given method provides all the desired groups, the proof given in the last chapter
that all the groups just found are generally distinct from each other takes up a lot of space
and seemingly involves many difﬁculties.
This is not altogether intelligible. The reference to the Galois groups of binomial
equations (Xn −1 = 0) being cyclic and therefore a special case of abelian groups
marks a step on the road by which the term ‘abelian group’ was introduced into
mathematics.
The so-called Galois imaginaries were introduced in Galois’s (1830). In modern
terms they are elements of a ﬁnite degree extension of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. They were
brieﬂy discussed in Sect. 23.2.
The paragraph marked with a star picks up two remarkable things: the range of
geometrical examples known to Jordan, and the fact that he gave a method, involving
what are called hyper-elliptic functions, for solving any polynomial equation. This
method is, of course, not algebraic. There then follows a brisk indication of what
Jordan did in creating a theory of Galois groups.

Introduction
Another source of ideas for modern algebra, speciﬁcally group theory, was the
rapidly changing ﬁeld of geometry. By 1870 projective geometry was being seen as
the most elementary and therefore most fundamental form of geometry, and, thanks
to the publication of Beltrami’s (1868), the new subject of non-Euclidean geometry
was starting to gain acceptance among mathematicians—but not philosophers. It
was in this context that, in 1871, the next major mathematical contribution was
made, and the subjects of projective and non-Euclidean geometry started to come
together. The so-called Kleinian view of geometry, as presented by Klein in 1872,
revolves around the idea of a mother geometry and sub-geometries: projective
geometry is the fundamental geometry and the other geometries (for example,
Euclidean and non-Euclidean) are special cases.1
Klein saw a role for groups in several ways in geometry, and this chapter also
brieﬂy indicates how he used group theory to study the symmetries and other
mathematical properties of the regular icosahedron.

Felix Klein
Young German mathematicians in the nineteenth century were encouraged to travel
to other universities to enlarge their education, and in autumn 1869 Klein travelled to
Berlin to take part in the lively mathematical seminars of Kummer and Weierstrass,
in which the members lectured on topics they had chosen themselves. The trip was

Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
not a success, but while there he heard of the existence of non-Euclidean geometry,
and, he wrote later, immediately conjectured that it was closely connected to the so-
called Cayley metric (to be described below) and “I made sure of this idea despite
the most vehement opposition”.
In Berlin he met the somewhat older Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, and
travelled with him to Paris to learn group theory from Camille Jordan. His trip was
cut short by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, but barely a year after his
return, on Clebsch’s recommendation, Klein was appointed as a full Professor of
Mathematics in Erlangen in autumn 1872, at the astonishing age of only 23.
For his Inaugural Address he lectured on the importance of pure and applied
mathematics and how they should be taught. Of more lasting importance was a
short paper that he circulated at the time, in which he gave a uniform account of
the existing directions of geometrical research and sorted them into a system: the
famous ‘Erlanger Programm’.2 In the 1890s this became a retrospective guideline
for his research.3
In 1871 and 1873 he published in two papers entitled ‘On the so-called non-
Euclidean geometry’ that probably did more to convey the message of the Programm
than did his obscurely published pamphlet.4 Cayley (1859) had noticed a way in
which one can start with projective geometry and smuggle in the idea of Euclidean
distance, but only Klein saw the generality of the idea. It rests on the use of cross-
ratio.
Consider a chord PQ of a circle passing through two points A and B. The cross-
ratio of the four points P, A, B, Q is deﬁned to be CR (P, A, Q, B) = PA
PB · QB
QA. It
follows that if C is another point on the same line then
CR (P, A, Q, B) · CR (P, B, Q, C) =
PA
PB · QB
QA · PB
PC · QC
QB = PA
PC · QC
QA = CR (P, A, Q, C) .
So Klein deﬁned d (AB) = −1
2 log CR (P, A, Q, B), which gave him
d (AB) + d (BC) = d (AC) ,
whenever A, B, and C lie in that order on a line. Therefore one can consider d (AB)
as the length from A to B (the minus sign is to make lengths positive).
2See Klein (1872), English translation (1893).
3See also Lê (2015) for more about the context.
4Note the ‘so-called’—one presumes that Klein did not want ill-informed criticism from non-
mathematicians.

implies that a = ea′−e−a′
ea′+e−a′ = tanh a′. So a point a Euclidean distance of a from
the origin is a non-Euclidean distance of tanh−1 a from the origin. Note that
0 < a < 1 is consistent with 0 < tanh a′ < 1.
Why does this work? For any deﬁnition of length we require that the length of a
segment does not alter as it is moved around. In particular, the segment cannot return
to only a part of its original position. Invariance is guaranteed in the present case,
because cross-ratio is invariant under projective transformations. That is to say, if a
projective transformation sends A, B, P, Q to A′, B′, P ′, Q′ respectively, then
CR (P, A, Q, B) = CR

P ′, A′, Q′, B′
.
Therefore a projective transformation mapping the circle to itself and the line AB
meeting the circle at points P and Q to the line A′B′ meeting the circle at points P ′
and Q′, satisﬁes
d (AB) = d 
A′B′
so the above deﬁnition is in fact satisfactory.
Klein showed in this way in his (1871) how to derive the fundamental formulae
of two-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry by using projective ideas. In his (1873)
he extended these arguments to n dimensions. Ever the scholar, and ever eager to
impress, he also cited a formidable range of predecessors: not only Lobachevskii,
as Beltrami had, but Bolyai (in the original and in an Italian translation), Beltrami,
and Cayley.
Klein was pleased to bring non-Euclidean geometry and projective geometry
together, for in his view geometry had become too fragmented. Even so, he missed
afﬁne geometry, which is a geometry of the plane in which transformations send
lines to lines and preserve ratios of lengths. He did, however, mention that inversion
in circles is geometrically interesting, and this gave him another geometry.
He brought about this sense of unity through his innovative use of the group
concept. His presentation, as he himself noted when the work was reprinted in the
1890s, was less than perfect—the only property of a group that he insisted upon was
closure—but the point Klein was making was important. He shifted attention from
ﬁgures to transformations, and argued that geometry was about groups as well as

370
E
Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
the invariant properties of shapes. He deﬁned a geometric property to be one that
was invariant under all the operations of the group associated to that geometry. So
cross-ratio is a property of projective geometry because it is not altered by projective
transformations, and it does not need to be built up out of lengths, which are not,
indeed, projective invariants.
The Erlanger Programm in the 1890s
Klein proceeded to work on other topics, until in the 1890s he found himself back
at Göttingen, now as a senior professor with an empire to build. He arranged for
visitors to translate the Erlanger Programm into English, Italian, French, Russian,
Polish and Hungarian, and presented it as a research Programm uniting geometry
and group theory. Indeed, those two subjects had not only progressed considerably
in the intervening 20 years and had indeed grown closer together, but it would
be hard to argue that Klein himself had worked intensively on drawing out its
implications. It was the situation in the 1890s that gave the Erlanger Programm a
prominence that it continues to enjoy. The use of group theory to classify geometries
did indeed bring a unity to the subject that had begun to disappear.
The question of the inﬂuence of Klein’s Erlanger Programm has been much
debated. Many universities that teach geometry teach the Kleinian view of geometry,
which is exactly the view that various different geometries, all the ones where
we represent the transformations with matrices, form into a hierarchy. But is this
because of the Programm? Earlier historians of mathematics, and many mathe-
maticians, Garrett Birkhoff among them, believe that it was of great inﬂuence.5
More recently, a number of historians have argued convincingly against this view.6
They argue that group theory was established between 1870 and 1890 by Camille
Jordan, Sophus Lie, and Henri Poincaré without the Erlanger Programm having any
impact.7 The Programm is a very convenient peg on which to hang a number of
ideas, but it was probably not their source or inspiration.
E.3
Geometric Groups: The Icosahedral Group
Klein promoted visual, geometric thinking at every opportunity, as a way of
understanding problems and as a way of generating new research. Here we look
brieﬂy at his geometrical account of how the group A5 enters the study of the quintic

equation, which Klein described very fully in his famous book On the icosahedron
(1884).
The regular icosahedron Icos has V = 12 vertices, E = 30 edges, and F = 20
faces. Note that V −E +F = 2, the Euler characteristic of the sphere. It is easier to
work with its dual, the regular dodecahedron, which has its vertices at the midpoints
of the faces of the icosahedron and vice versa. So it has 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 12
faces. Every face has a diametrically opposite face, so let us put the dodecahedron
with its top face horizontal, label that face a, and the faces around it b, c, d, e, f . We
label the diametrically opposite faces a′, b′, c′, d′, e′, f ′. The point O equidistant
from all the vertices is called the centre of the dodecahedron.
We now consider the symmetry group of the icosahedron, GI. To specify a
rotation it is enough to say where one face goes, say a—this puts it in one of 12
positions—and where an adjacent face goes, say b—for which there are 5 choices—
so GI has at least 60 elements. Each one of these can be composed with a reﬂection
in a plane through the centre and an edge of the dodecahedron. Any symmetry of
the dodecahedron is either a rotation or a rotation composed with a reﬂection, so
GI has 120 elements, and the group of direct symmetries or rotations, G+
I , has 60
elements.
If we regard each element of G+
I as a permutation of the 12 faces we get a map
from GI to S12, the group of permutations of 12 objects. This map is far from being
onto, and it is more convenient to look at the action of G+
I on the six body diagonals
of the dodecahedron—the lines joining the midpoint of a face to the midpoint of the
opposite face. These are permuted by G+
I and so we obtain a map from G+
I to S6.
Next, a look at where we are heading. The ﬁrst important group of order 60 that
we meet is surely A5, the alternating group on ﬁve letters. It is natural to wonder
if G+
I is isomorphic to this group. But currently we have it represented in S6, and
there is another interesting group around, to which we now turn.
To obtain this group we start with the ﬁeld of ﬁve elements, F5, denoted
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and form the plane (the two-dimensional vector space) with these
coordinates, F2
5, and we look at the linear maps from this plane to itself that ﬁx the
origin and have determinant 1. We choose the obvious basis: (1, 0) and (0, 1) and we
observe that there are 6 directions for the image of (1, 0): (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2),
(1, 3), (1, 4). In each direction there are four choices for the image, which we denote
(a, b). There are now 5 choices for the direction of the image of (0, 1)—all ensure
that the linear transformation we are constructing is invertible—we denote the image
of (0, 1) by (ct, dt). The condition that the determinant be 1 forces (ad −bc)t = 1
and because the map is known to be invertible and so (ad −bc) ̸= 0 we have
t = (ad −bc)−1. So the maps we seek are speciﬁed by the image of (1, 0) and the
direction for (0, 1). This gives us a group of 6 · 4 · 5 = 120 elements, known as 2I,
the binary icosahedral group, or SL(2, 5). If we factor out by the centre—the maps
that commute with every element of this group, and which consists of two elements
1 0
0 1

and
 4 0
0 4

—we obtain a quotient group of order 60, known as PSL(2, 5),
the projective special linear group (of the 2-dimensional vector space over the ﬁeld
of 5 elements). Klein called this group I or the icosahedral group.

372
E
Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
There is another way of looking at this group that helps explain the modern name.
Every time we have a vector space of dimension say n + 1 over a ﬁeld F we can
form the corresponding projective space of dimension n whose points are the 1-
dimensional vector subspaces (lines through the origin). When we do that with
F2
5 we obtain the 1-dimensional projective space F5P 1 with 6 points, represented
in homogeneous coordinates by [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], which is
convenient to denote ∞, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The group action we have is given by
z →az + b
cz + d ,
a, b, c, d ∈F5, ad −bc ̸= 0.
We shall often represent this map by the matrix
 a b
c d

but when we do notice that
the maps z →az+b
cz+d and z →taz+tb
tcz+td have the same effect, so we factor out the
matrices of the form
 t 0
0 t

, and once again obtain the group PSL(2, 5).
Now, it is apparent from its construction that PSL(2, 5) is represented as a
subgroup of S6 in the same way that we obtained GI, so it is likely that they are
isomorphic. The questions then become: how do we show this, and what have they
to do with A5?
It is easy to see that PSL(2, 5) acts doubly transitively on the set of six
directions. It is enough to show that the directions ∞and 0 can be sent to the
directions a and b ̸= a. The cases a = ∞, b = 0 and a = 0, b = ∞are trivial,
so we may assume a and b are chosen from 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider the element
a b
1 1

. It sends the directions ∞and 0 to the directions a and b ̸= a, and it has
determinant a −b, so the required element is
a a −1
1
1

.
Likewise, G+
I acts doubly transitively on the set of six axes of the dodecahedron
that join diametrically opposite mid-face point. However, it is not clear that A5 acts
on a set of six things, nor that PSL(2, 5) or G+
I act on ﬁve. We can easily compute
that each of the three groups has 15 elements of order 2, 20 elements of order 3,
and 24 elements of order 5, which makes it certain that the groups are isomorphic,
but leaves the isomorphisms between them obscure. A better way to proceed is to
look at the subgroups of these groups and let the each group act on its subgroups by
conjugation.
One way to understand the group A5 is that it has 5 subgroups of order 12, each
of which is isomorphic to A4. These are the groups that ﬁx exactly one of the ﬁve
objects that are permuted by A5—for example, the even permutations that ﬁx the
object 5. These ﬁve subgroups are permuted by conjugation in A5.
Within each copy of A4 is a unique copy of the Klein group, for example the
group consisting of the identity element and the elements
(12)(34), (13)(24), and (14)(23).

E
Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
373
This suggests that we should look for elements of Klein groups in the other two
groups. With the group PSL(2, 5) we can make a start by looking for elements that
switch the directions ∞and 0. This is done by a matrix of the form
 0 b
a 0

. The
determinant must be 1, so we have ab = −1, and this gives us the elements
0 2
2 0

and
 0 1
4 0

.
The ﬁrst of these corresponds to this permutation of the directions: (∞0)(23).
The second corresponds to this permutation of the directions: (∞0)(14).
Each of these transformations ﬁxes two directions, and this suggests that we look
at the transformations that ﬁx ∞and 0. The non-identity transformation that does
this turns out to be
2 0
0 3

, which is the product of the previous two transformations,
and corresponds to the permutation (23)(14).
It is clear from their representation as permutations that these transformations
and the identity together deﬁne a Klein group. How many such groups are there in
PSL(2, 5)? We may pair ∞with any other element and argue as before, but we ﬁnd
that when we do we can make no further choices. So there are ﬁve of these Klein
groups, and PSL(2, 5) acts on them by conjugation.
To ﬁnd Galois’s ﬁve groups of order 12 in PSL(2, 5) we observe that this group
will necessarily have element of orders 2, 3, and 5. So we ﬁnd an element τ of order
5, for example z →z + 1, and an element σ of order 2, say z →−1/z. We then
check that their composite τσ, which is z →(z −1)/z, has order 3 and that these
elements generate a group of order 12, as required. Conjugation produces four other
groups of this kind, and we are done.

Now we turn to identifying the ﬁve Klein groups in G+
I , the group of the
dodecahedron. In Fig. E.1 we look at lines like AA′ joining a mid-edge point A to
its opposite vertices, marked as A′ and D′. The pentagonal faces are congruent, so
these line segments are equal (say to α). Likewise, all the lengths from a vertex along

374
E
Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
an edge to the midpoint of that edge (such as A′B) are equal, say to β. Therefore
AB = BC = CD = DA,
each being α + β. The symmetry of the dodecahedron also forces the angles AA′B,
BB′C, CC′D and DD′A to be equal. Therefore ABCD is in fact a square, and if
we denote the centre of the dodecahedron by O the four angles AOB, BOC, COD,
DOA are right angles, and the points A and C are diametrically opposite, as are B
and D.

We are now able to follow the effect of a rotation through π about the axes AC
and BD on the faces of the dodecahedron. Label the front face in Fig. E.2 ∞and the
others as shown, and label the faces round the back (with some dashed edges) with
the label of their diametrically opposite face. Then rotation through π about the axis
AC is the permutation (∞0)(23), and rotation through π about the axis BD is the
permutation (∞0)(14). The composition of these rotations is (23)(14), as required.
The dodecahedron has 20 vertices, occurring in 10 diametrically opposite pairs.
The above construction pairs the pairs (AC with BD, for example), so there are ﬁve
squares of the kind described and so ﬁve Klein groups in G+
I . Again, G acts on them
by conjugation.
We deduce that the three groups PSL(2, 5), G, and A5 are isomorphic because
they are even permutations on ﬁve objects.
A prettier way to understand how G+
I permutes 5 things is to see that there are
the ﬁve cubes that share vertices with the icosahedron. Each cube has twelve edges,
and the icosahedron has twelve faces, so one edge (of a cube) goes in each face, and
it goes in as a diagonal of the pentagon (note that there are indeed ﬁve of these, so
each cube has one edge in each face of the dodecahedron). I leave it as an exercise
to ﬁnd these cubes.
We need one ﬁnal representation of G+
I , which is obtained by inscribing it in
a sphere and then looking at a suitably symmetric image of it on the plane after
stereographic projection. The edges of the icosahedron are arcs of great circles on
the sphere, so they project to circular arcs in the plane, and so elements of G+
I will

Of these, one is a rotation through an angle of 2π/5. If, with Klein, we place one
vertex at z = 0 and another at z = ∞, and the remaining vertices at the points
ρk(ρ +ρ4), and ρk(ρ2 +ρ3), where ρ = e2π1/5 is a ﬁfth root of unity, this rotation
is z →ρz. Another element is a rotation through an angle of 2π/5 about the point
ρ, and these rotations generate the group.8
E.4
The Icosahedral Equation
A typical point on a face of the icosahedron is moved to a total of 60 positions under
the action of the rotation group G+
I . But there are points with smaller orbits: the 12
centres of faces, the 20 vertices, and the 30 mid-edge points. Klein considered each
of these in turn. He looked at a ﬁxed image of the icosahedron on the plane. The
12 centres of faces are 12 points of the plane, and so they satisfy a polynomial of
degree 12. By looking at their coordinates and knowing how they are found, Klein
was able to write down this polynomial; it is
f (z1, z2) = z1z2(z10
1 + 11z1z2 −z10
2 ),
where Klein used homogeneous coordinates to handle the point at inﬁnity. We can
regard z1/z2 = z. This polynomial is invariant under the action of the group.
From this polynomial Klein extracted another by means of a piece of the theory
of forms that we have not discussed. It is the so-called Hessian of f , denoted H =
H(f ), and which is of degree 20 in this case:
H(z1, z2) = −(z20

2 ) + 228(z15
1 z5
2 −z5
1z15
2 ) −494z10

2 ,
and its zeros correspond to the 20 vertices of the icosahedron.9 This polynomial is
also invariant under the action of the group.
8Klein went on in 1878 to investigate the next group in the sequence after P SL(2, 5). This is
P SL(2, 7), a famous group of order 168. There is now an extensive literature on the group, which
plays an important role in the study of automorphism groups of Riemann surfaces among other
topics, and one may begin by consulting the book The Eightfold Way, The Beauty of Klein’s Quartic
Curve (1999). For a historical introduction, see Gray (1999).
9The Hessian of a homogeneous function of two variables is the determinant of its second partial
derivatives.

E
Klein’s Erlanger Programm, Groups and Geometry
A further use of the same pre-existing theory gave Klein a homogeneous
polynomial of degree 30 that is also invariant under the action of the group.10 The
zeros of this form are the mid-edge points of the icosahedron:
T (z1, z2) = (z30
1 + z30
2 ) + 522(z25
1 z5
2 −z5
1z25
2 ) −10005(z20
1 z10
2 + z10
1 z20
2 ).
Moreover, these three homogeneous polynomials satisfy an equation (wonder-
fully known as a syzygy!):
T 2 + H 3 −1728f 5 = 0.
Klein set
Z : Z −1 : 1 = H 3 : −T 2 : 1728f 5,
and wrote
q(z) =
H(z1, z2)3
1728f (z1, z2)5 = H(z, 1)3
f (z, 1)5 ,
and called the equation
q(z) = u
the icosahedral equation. It is an equation of degree 60 that depends on a single
parameter u.
He now set himself a number of tasks, of which these interest us:
•
to explain how any irreducible quintic equation can be written in this form;
•
to explain how the icosahedral group appears geometrically (and not just
abstractly) as the Galois group of the general quintic equation;
•
to explain why certain equations of degree 6 reduce to the quintic equation (an
old question raised by Galois and solved in the late 1850s by Hermite, Kronecker,
and Brioschi).
10This is the so-called functional determinant of the form f and its Hessian, which is the
determinant of the ﬁrst partial derivatives of the two forms.

Appendix F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement
(1894)
Dedekind explained at the end of the preceding section of his Supplement XI Über
die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen, (1894) that the aim was to use his theory
of modules over a quadratic ﬁeld Ω to present a general theory that included the
composition of binary forms.
The division of binary quadratic forms into genera (Supplement IV) can be carried over
easily to the theory of ideals, and both this question and proof of the reciprocity theorem
that rests on the enumeration of two-sided classes (§§152 to 154) acquires a far simpler
form in the new presentation, whose production we must, however, leave to the reader. On
the other hand, we would like to introduce the general theory of modules for quadratic
ﬁelds, because this includes the composition theory for binary quadratic forms and is of
great signiﬁcance for many other questions, e.g. for the theory of complex multiplication of
elliptic functions.1
He had already deﬁned a module as a subset of Ω that is closed under subtraction;
it is exactly what we would call a Z module: a subset closed under addition,
subtraction, and multiplication by rational integers (but not, as an ideal is, closed
under multiplication by all integers in Ω).
I brieﬂy summarise the opening paragraphs of this section, which is the last part
of a very long paper. Dedekind began by observing that he had already shown that
every ﬁnite (i.e. ﬁnite-dimensional) module m over a quadratic ﬁeld Ω has a basis of
the form [α, β], where α and β are independent. Straight-forward calculations now
showed that in fact there is a rational number (i.e. a fraction of two ordinary integers)
m and an irrational number ω such that the module is m[1, ω]. Furthermore, ω
satisﬁes the quadratic equation
aω2 −bω + c = 0,

All references to sections of the paper before this one are to material covered
in the notes. It will help to remember the mantra ‘to divide is to contain’. As for
notation, the expression a > b means that b divides a—be careful! Given two
modules m and m′ Dedekind deﬁned the quotient of m′ by m to be the module
{ν : νm > m′}, and denoted it m′
m . Given modules or ideals a, b and α ∈a one
can deﬁned the conjugacy class of all elements in a conjugate mod b to α, that is,
the set {α′ ∈a | α −α′ ∈b}. Then (a, b) denotes the number of such conjugacy
classes. In the setting where a and b are two modules with least common multiple
m = a−b = a∩b, Dedekind denoted the number of congruence classes of elements
in a modulo m by (a, m). So (a, b) = 1 if and only if a is divisible by b.
At one point in what follows we also need Dedekind’s deﬁnition of a proper
module. You will see below that given a module m he deﬁned its order, m0, to be
{ν : m ⊃νm}. He deﬁned (§170) m−1 to be the quotient m0
m , and m−n to be the
quotient m0
mn . He said a module was proper if mm−1 = m0. He then proved that for
proper modules a and b
(a−1)0 = a0, (a−1)−1 = a, (ab)0 = a0b0, (ab)−1 = a−1b−1.
I have tacitly omitted all but one of the footnotes Dedekind supplied because they
would take us too far aﬁeld to explain.
The Extract, §187, pp. 207–216
By the order m0 of a module m, which we shall more brieﬂy denote by n, we shall
understand, as before (§170) the totality of all numbers ν for which mν is divisible
by m. It obviously follows from this deﬁnition that if η denotes an arbitrary nonzero
number then n is at the same time the order of ηm; if we therefore maintain the
previous designations then the sought-for numbers ν are all those for which [ν, νω]
is divisible by [1, ω], and for this it is necessary and sufﬁcient that both numbers ν
and νω are contained in [1, ω]. Therefore we must have ν = x + yω, where x and

F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
379
y denote rational integers; then νω = xω + yω2, and since xω is in [1, ω] this must
also be true for yω2; consequently (3) becomes
yω2 = y(bω −c)
a
,
consequently both products by and cy must be divisible by a; but the numbers a, b, c
have no common factor, so it follows that y must be divisible by a, so it must be
the case that y = az and ν = x + zaω where z is likewise a rational integer; and
since conversely every such number x + zaω has the requisite property we obtain
the result that
(7)
n = [1, aω] = [1, kθ] = ok + [1].
Every order n is therefore a module which contains only integers and among
these the number 1 and therefore every rational integer (cf. §173, III); conversely it
is clear that every such module n (in our case of the quadratic ﬁelds) is certainly also
an order, namely the order of n itself. For the discriminant, index, and conductor of
an order n we readily deduce from (4), (6), and (7) that
(8)
Δ(n) = d, (o, n) = k, n
o = ok,
and it is clear that every order n is completely determined by its index k.2
It is clear that every module m is an ideal then and only then, when it is divisible
by o, and n = o, so k = 1, and m is an integer divisible by a. This allows us,
therefore to extend the idea of the norm to an arbitrary module m, and indeed we
will here understand by the quotient
(9)
N(m) = (n, m)
(m, n),
which in fact, when m is an ideal reduces to the earlier deﬁnition of the correspond-
ing value (o, m) (§180). Since the basis numbers for m are related to those of n by
the linear equations
m = m · 1 + 0 · aω, mω = 0 · 1 + m
a · aω
the result follows [from §175, (10)] that
(10)
N(m) =

From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)

at the end of this Appendix.]
If α is an arbitrary number in the ﬁeld Ω and one generally denotes by α′ the
conjugate number that α goes to under the non-identity permutation of the ﬁeld,
then
(11)
a(ω + ω′) = b, aωω′ = c;
as μ runs through all the numbers in the module m the numbers μ′ form the
conjugate module m[1, ω′] to m, which we will denote by m′. If we retain the above
choice of basis, then we have to set
(12)
m′ = m[1, −ω′]
and since
a(−ω′)2 −(−b)(−ω′) + c = 0
the transition from m to m′ is easily carried out by replacing b with −b while
m, a, c, k, d remain unaltered. Thus m is naturally conjugate to m′ and both
modules have the same order n = n′ and the same norm; so they are then only
identical if b is divisible by a, so b ≡0 or ≡a (mod 2a), and in this case m can be
considered as a two-sided module (cf. §58).
Every number μ contained in the module m is of the form
(13)
μ = m(x + yω),
where x, y denote rational integers; from this it follows that
N(μ) = μμ′ = m2(x + yω)(x + yω′)a
and on carrying out the multiplication this gives
(14)
N(μ) = μμ′ = N(m)(ax2 + bxy + cy2);
therefore to every module m there corresponds, if we maintain the above rules for
the choice of basis, an original binary quadratic form (a, 1
2b, c) or rather to a deﬁnite
family of inﬁnitely many such parallel forms [i.e. equivalent forms, JJG] in which
b runs through all the individuals in a deﬁnite number class with respect to the
modulus 2a and whose discriminant b2 −4ac is simultaneously the discriminant
d of the order n; to the conjugate module m′ corresponds the corresponding
family (a, −1
2b, c). [At this point in (1879) Dedekind explained the concept of
multiplication of modules.] Evidently the same family (a, 1
2b, c) corresponds to all

F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
381
and only those modules of the form m n, where n is any non-zero rational number.
Since further the numbers 1, aω form a basis for the order n, and
aωμ = m(−cy + (ax + by)ω)
    
x
y
−cy ax + by
    = ax2 + bxy + cy2
so the form (a, 1
2b, c) coincides exactly with the one that we earlier (on p. 156 of
this paper) said corresponded with the module m.
[Here I insert some results from §170 that Dedekind proceeds to ask his readers
to recall:
•
(Theorem V): a module a is a proper module if and only if it is a factor of its
order a0, i.e. when there is a module n that satisﬁes the condition an = a0, and
consequently a−1 = na0.
•
(Theorem VII) If a is a proper, and b an arbitrary module, then
(36)
ab
a = ba−1.
•
(Theorem VIII) If a and b are proper modules then so is their product ab and
(37)
(ab)0 = a0b0, (ab)−1 = a−1b−1.]
As we now turn to the multiplication of modules, we ﬁrst recall two general results
proved in §170 (p. 72)
(15)
mn = m, n2 = n,
which can be derived easily by actual multiplication from (2) and (7).3 Of particular
importance is the construction of the product m m′ of two conjugate modules. From
(2) and (12) we at once obtain by multiplication
mm′ = m2[1, ω, ω′, ωω′].
If one adds the second basis number to the third, one obtains
mm′ = m2
a [a, aω, b, c]
and since [a, b, c] = [1] we obtain the result
(16)
mm′ = m2
a [1, aω] = nN(m);
3These are the equations (2) m = [m, mω] = m[1, ω], and (7) n = [1, aω] = [1, kθ] = ok + [1].

382
F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
in which m (after §170 V) is a proper module, and so it immediately follows that
(17)
m′ = m−1N(m).
We now consider the product of two arbitrary modules m and m1, and set
(18)
mm1 = m2;
since m2 consists of all numbers μ2 of the form  μμ1 the conjugate module m′
2
consists of all numbers μ2 of the form  μ′μ′
1, and consequently
m′m′
1 = m′
2 = (mm1)′.
On multiplying these two equations, one obtains as a result
nn1N(m)N(m1) = n2N(m2),
where n1, n2 denote the orders of m1, m2; now since the product nn1 contains only
integers and evidently also the number 1 it is, by what was said above, an order; the
previous equation therefore shows that if one cancels the rational numbers entering
each side one obtains the theorem
(19)
N(m)N(m1) = N(m2) = N(mm1)
whence the following:
(20)
nn1 = n2;
the norm of a product is therefore equal to the product of the norms of the factors,
and likewise the order of a product is equal to the product of the orders of the factors
(cf. §170, VIII).
Since the number 1 is contained in each order, the product nn1 is a common
divisor of n and n1, and indeed, as will now be shown, its greatest common divisor.
If k, k1, k2 denote the indices of the orders n, n1, n2, then n = [1, kθ], n1 = [1, k1θ]
and so
nn1 = [1, kθ, k1θ, kk1θ2];
but since θ2 = Dθ −D1, where D1 is a rational integer, the last basis number kk1θ2
can be dropped, because it is a sum of multiples of the ﬁrst two, and one obtains
(21)
nn1 = [1, kθ, k1θ] = n + n1,
as was required. Since, from (20), the same product is also = [1, k2θ], it follows
that k2, the index of the product, is the greatest common divisor of k, k1, the indices

F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
383
of the factors. If furthermore d, d1, d2 denote the discriminants of n, n1, n2, then
d = Dk2, d1 = Dk2
1, d2 = Dk2
2, and consequently the discriminant of the product
is also the greatest common divisor of the discriminants of the factors.
The last theorem also comes about in the following way, where we let the letters
m1, ω1, a1, b1, c1 and m2, ω2, a2, b2, c2 have the same meaning for the modules m1
and m2 that m, ω, a, b, c had for m. Then it follows from (20) that
[1, a2ω2] = [1, aω][1, a1ω1] = [1, aω, a1ω1, aa1ωω1],
and therefore (from §172) there are four equations of the form (22)
1 = 1 · 1 + 0 · a2ω2
aω = f · 1 + e · a2ω2
a1ω1 = f1 · 1 + e1 · a2ω2
aa1ωω1 = f2 · 1 + e2 · a2ω2,
where the eight coefﬁcients on the right are rational integers such that the six
determinants formed from them,
e, e1, e2, f e1 −ef1, f e2 −ef2, f1e2 −e1f2
have no common factor; but since every common factor of the ﬁrst three also goes
into the following ones, it follows that e, e1, e2 have no common factor. So it further
follows from (22) that
(f + ea2ω2)(f + e1a2ω2) = (f + e2a2ω2),
so
ee1(a2ω2)2 −(e2 −ef1 −e1f )(a2ω2) + ff1 −f2 = 0;
if one compares this with the equation
(a2ω2)2 −b2(a2ω2) + a2c2 = 0,
then it follows that
(23)
e2 = ef1 + e1f + ee1b2, f2 = ff1 −ee1a2c2;
from the ﬁrst of these equations it follows that every common divisor of e, e1 also
goes into e2; since it was shown above that these three numbers have no common

384

divisor so e, e1 are relatively prime numbers. If now (5) is used to replace the
quantities aω, a1ω1, a2ω2 with
b + k

it follows that
(24)
k = ek2, k1 = e1k2, (n1, n) = e, (n, n1) = e1,
so also

d = d2e2, d1 = d2e2

and moreover
(26)
f = b −b2e

, f1 = b1 −b2e

;
similarly one obtains from the last of equations (22) or by substituting the above
expressions in (23),
(27)
e2 = be1 + b1e
2
, f2 = bb1 + d2ee1 −2b2e2
4
.
From (24) and (25) it follows once again that k2 is the greatest common divisor of
k, k1, as similarly d2 is for d, d1.
So if two modules m, m1 are given one ﬁnds the numbers e, e1, k2, d2 from (24)
and (25) under the condition that e, e1 must be relatively prime, and in this way,
because of (27) e2 is also found. We shall now see how to determine the module m2
completely by obtaining the numbers m2, a2, b2, c2 from the given data. Since the
product m1 is contained in m2 and consequently also in [m2], one can immediately
set
(28)
mm1 = pm2, m2 = mm1
p
where p denotes a natural number; one now replaces the norms entering theorem
(19) by their expressions in (10), to obtain
(29)
aa1 = p2a2, a2 = aa1
p2
,
so the determination of m2 and a2 is reduced to that of p. One next replaces the
modules m, m1, m2 by the expressions (2), so that the equation m2 = mm1 takes
the form
(30)
[1, ω2] = p[1, ω][1, ω1] = p[1, ω1, ω, ωω1];

F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
385
so (after §172) one can set (31)
p = p · 1 + 0 · ω2
pω1 = p′ · 1 + q′ · ω2
pω = p′′ · 1 + q′′ · ω2
p = ωω1 = p′′′ · 1 + q′′′ · ω2
where the eight coefﬁcients on the right-hand side are rational integers such that the
six determinants formed from them
pq′, pq′′, pq′′′, p′q′′ −q′p′′, p′q′′′ −q′p′′′, p′′q′′′ −q′′p′′′,
like the three numbers q′, q′′, q′′′ have no common divisor. If one now substitutes
for ω, ω1, ωω1 the expressions from (22) one obtains the equations
p(f1 + e1a2ω2) = a1(p′ + q′ω2)
p(f + ea2ω2) = a1(p′′ + q′′ω2)
p(f + e2a2ω2) = aa1(p′′ + q′′ω2),
which, since ω2 is irrational, break into the following
(32)
pe1a2 = a1q′, pea2 = aq′′, pe12a2 = aa1q′′′,
(33)
pf1 = a1p′, pf = ap′′′, pf2 = aa1p′′′.
If one substitutes the corresponding expression for a2 from (29) one obtains
(34)
ae1 = pq′, a1e = pq′′, e2 = pq′′′,
and since q′, q′′, q′′′ as remarked above, have no common divisor, p is evi-
dently determined as the greatest (positive) common divisor of the three numbers
ae1, ae, e2, and the same therefore holds for three numbers q′, q′′, q′′′ as well as
for the two numbers m2, a2 which are given by Eqs. (28) and (29). If one further
multiplies Eq. (33) by 2a, 2a1, 1 and replaces aa1 by p2a2, one obtains from (34), on
replacing f1, f, f2 by the expressions given for them in (26) and (27), the equations
ab1
p −q′b2 = 2a2p′, a1b
p −q′′b2 = 2a2p′′,
bb1 + d2ee1
2p
−q′′′b2 = 2a2p′′′,

386
F
From Dedekind’s 11th Supplement (1894)
and the congruences (35) (mod 2a2):
q′b2 ≡ab1
p , q′′b2 ≡a1b
p , q′′′b2 ≡bb1 + d2ee1
2p
;
in which the number b2 is completely determined with respect to the modulus 2a2,
because q′, q′′, q′′′ have no common divisor (cf. §145); and from this it ﬁnally
follows that c2 is given by the equation
(36)
c2 = b2
2 −d2
4a2
.
This completes the determination of the product m1 from the two factors m, m1,
and we have now only to make the following remark. Since the existence of the
module m2 = mm1 is known from what was said earlier, we must conclude that the
numbers entering (26), (27), (29), (35), and (36) in the form of fractions are really
integers, that furthermore the three congruences (35) are really the same, and that
the resulting numbers a2, b2, c2 have no common factors; this can easily be shown
directly, and we leave it to the reader.4
We now denote by x, y and x1, y1 two systems of independent variables and
construct the bilinear functions (37)
x2 = pxx1 + p′xy1 + p′′yx1 + p′′′yy1
y2 =
q′xy1 + q′′yx1 + q′′′yy1
further one sets
μ = m(x + yω), μ1 = m(x1 + y1ω1), μ2 = m2(x2 + y2ω2),
then it follows from (28) and (31) that μ2 = μμ1, and so also for rational values of
the variables N(μ2) = N(μ)N(μ1); if one looks at these norms by their expressions
in (14) and looks back at (19) it follows that
(38)
a2x2
2 + b2x2y2 + c2y2
2 = (ax2 + bxy + cy2)(a1x2
1 + b1x1y1 + c1y2
1);
one therefore says that the form (a2, 1
2b2, c2) passes by means of the bilinear
substitution (37) into the product of the two forms (a, 1
2b, c) and (a1, 1
2b1, c1), and
calls the ﬁrst form the compound of the latter two; evidently (38), in virtue of (37),
is an identity that holds for all values of the independent variables.

Subgroups of S4 and S5
G.1
The Subgroups of S4
The subgroups of S4 can all be found by looking at the possible types of permu-
tations that can occur. By Lagrange’s theorem, the possible orders of subgroups of
S4, which has order 24, are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, and it is easy to see that groups
of each order can occur (but not every non-isomorphic group of each order). The
cycle types give us cyclic subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to the
possible orders of the elements of the group S4. The two non-isomorphic groups
of order 4 both occur, the cyclic one and the non-cyclic one where all the non-
identity elements have order 2 (the Klein group, K). The three conjugate copies
of the cyclic one are generated by four-cycles: {e, (1234), (13)(24), (1432)} is an
example. There are four non-cyclic ones: K = {e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)},
the symmetry group of a rectangle with vertices labelled {1, 2, 3, 4}, and three of
which {e, (12), (34), (12)(34)} is an example. These three are mutually conjugate,
but K is a normal subgroup of S4.
Of the two non-isomorphic groups of order 6, any copy of S3 as a subgroup of
S4 will do for the non-commutative one, but the cyclic group of order 6 cannot be a
subgroup of S4 because there is no element of order 6 in S3.
There are ﬁve non-isomorphic groups of order 8, but it turns out that the
symmetry group of the square with vertices labelled {1, 2, 3, 4} is the only subgroup
of S4 of order 8.
The group A4 of even permutations is the only subgroup of S4 of order 12.
A subgroup H of S4 is normal if and only if it contains all the elements of a
given cycle type, because conjugation preserves cycle type, and any element of a
given cycle type is conjugate to any other element of that type (think of conjugating
as relabelling the elements). So the only normal subgroups of S4 are A4 and K.
Certainly K is normal in A4, and it is the only subgroup of A4 of order four. All
three elements of A4 of order 2 are contained in K, and each trivially generates a

normal subgroup C2 of K, but none of these subgroups of A4 is normal in A4, so
we have exhausted the possibilities for the composition series, which must be
S4 ▷A4 ▷K ▷C2 ▷{e}
The striking theorem found by Jordan is that if we look at the orders of successive
quotients then the numbers we get are independent of the choice of groups in the
sequence. In the present case we had no choice. Note that the numbers in the above
sequence are 2, 3, 2, 2, whose product is 24, as it should be.
G.2
The Subgroups of S5
In this case we shall not attempt to ﬁnd all the different subgroups, but merely
examine each possible order. By Lagrange’s theorem, the orders of the subgroups of
S5 are restricted to: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, and 60. How many
of these actually exist? Evidently, the cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 do, because
we may stay within one of the S4s that are the subgroups of S5 that ﬁx one object.
Notice, however, that elements with cycle type (. . .)(..) have order 6, so the cyclic
subgroup of order 6 is a subgroup of S5.
We are left with the orders 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40. Of these, the element
(12345) in S5 clearly generates a subgroup of order 5. The symmetries of a regular
pentagon with vertices labelled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} provide a subgroup of S5 of order 10.
To see that there is a subgroup of order 20 and that it is isomorphic to the group
we denoted G20 at the end of Sect. 10.2, we can argue by ﬁlling in the gaps in a
statement of Galois’s. At one point he looked at the ﬁeld (as we would call it) of
ﬁve elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4 mod 5}, which we shall call k5 for the moment, and at
maps from k5 to itself of the form j →aj + b, a, b ∈k5, a ̸= 0. Note that
aj + b = a′j + b′ if and only if a = a′ and b = b′.
We check, which Galois did not, that this is a group as follows
•
the composite of j →aj + b followed by j →a′j + b′ is a′(aj + b) + b′ =
a′aj + a′b + b′, which is of the given form;
•
the identity element is j →j;
•
the inverse transformation to j →aj + b is j →a−1j −a−1b.
This group has 20 elements: there are 4 choices for a and 5 for b, and they are
all distinct maps. To see that it is not commutative it is enough to ﬁnd a, a′, b and
b′ such that a′b + b′ ̸= ab′ + b, as is the case with a = b = b′ = 1, a′ = 2.
This group is generated by t(j) = j + 1 and d(j) = 2j, as we see by ﬁnding
tbda(j) explicitly. We need to ﬁnd a and b such that tbda(j) = a′j + b′ for given
a′ and b′. We have
tb(j) = j + b, da(j) = 2aj

G
Subgroups of S4 and S5
391
so
tb(da(j)) = tb(2aj) = 2aj + b = a′j + b′,
where a′ = 2a and b′ = b.
Finally, we see that this group is a subgroup of S5 by writing the effect of t and
d as permutations on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. I leave this as an exercise (but see some earlier
remarks).
The remaining orders (15, 30, and 40) are more difﬁcult. In a long paper of 1815
Cayley showed that the number of values a rational expression in n variables can
take is either 2 or it is greater than or equal to the largest odd prime that divides n.
In only slightly more modern language, Cayley showed that the size of an orbit of
a subgroup of the group Sn is either 2 or it is greater than or equal to p, the largest
odd prime dividing n. The size of the orbit is the index of the stabiliser of a point
of that orbit, and so the size of the stabiliser is either n!/2 or it is less than or equal
to n!/p. This rules out subgroups of index 3 or 4 in S5, so it has no subgroups of
orders 40 or 30. To see that there is no subgroup of order 15 it is simplest to argue
that, up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 15 – the cyclic group of
that order, which cannot be a subgroup of S5.
It is a famous fact that the only normal subgroup of S5 is A5 and A5 is simple.1
As a consequence, the composition series for S5 is 60, 2. To prove it, we can start
by listing the cycle types in A5 as follows:
•
the identity (.),
•
(. . .), and there are 5 · 4 · 3/3 = 20 of these,
•
(..)(..), and there are 5 · 4 · 3 · 2/2 · 2 · 2 = 15 of these,
•
(. . . ..), and there are 5 · 4 · 3 · 2/5 = 24 of these,
The question now is whether these cycle types coincide with conjugacy classes. To
see that any two elements with cycle type (. . .) are conjugate in A5 we observe
that the elements have either 1, 2, or 3 symbols in common. In the ﬁrst case, we
may write the elements as (123) and (145), and a suitable conjugating element is
(24)(35).
In the second case, we may write the elements as (123) and (124), or as (123)
and (142). The element (123) is conjugated into (124) with (345), and the element
(123) is conjugated into (142) with (243).
In the third case, we may write the elements as (123) and (132) and use (23)(45).
I leave it as exercises to show that any two elements with cycle type (..)(..) are
conjugate in A5. Moreover, we have
(123)(124) = (13)(24),

and
(13)(12) = (123),
so any subgroup of A5 that is a union of conjugacy classes must contain all elements
of types (. . .) and (..)(..), a total of 35, which is greater than 30, and so the subgroup
must be all of A5, and so A5 is a simple group, as claimed.2
However, some of the subgroups of S5 have interesting composition series. For
example, G20 has the normal subgroup S(pentagon) of order 10 consisting of
elements of the form x →±x + c (mod 5), which in turn has a normal subgroup
C5 consisting of elements of the form x →x + c (mod 5). The composition series
here goes 2, 2, 5.
2For deﬁniteness, the cycle type (. . . ..) splits into two conjugacy classes, exempliﬁed by (abcde)
and (abced). Using this information, we can deduce that no subgroup of A5 can be written as a
union of conjugacy classes, and so A5 is simple.

Appendix H
Curves and Projective Space
H.1
Intersections and Multiplicities
We say that a plane curve is of degree k if it can be deﬁned as the zero set of a
polynomial in two variables of degree k. Mathematicians in the eighteenth century
were aware that curves of degrees k and m should meet in km points. But they were
also aware that their intuition could not be turned into a theorem without being more
precise about the meaning of the terms involved, because otherwise the claim was
obviously false. Here we look at the problems and some of the work involved in
solving them.
Consider a line (a curve of degree 1) and a curve of degree k. They should meet
in k points. However, the parabola y = x2 and the line y −9 = 6(x −3) meet in
only one point, the point (3, 9) where the line is tangent to the curve. So points of
tangency have to be treated with care.
The line x = 3 also only meets the parabola in one point, the point (3, 9). Now
the only way out is to postulate a further intersection point ‘at inﬁnity’.
The line y = −1 does not meet the parabola at all. The remedy now must be to
introduce the idea of points with complex coordinates.
How can these problems be dealt with properly? The simplest solution to the
problem of tangents is to count intersection points with multiplicity, so a point of
tangency is counted twice. But this raises a problem when the curve has points of
self-intersection.
Consider now the folium of Descartes depicted in Fig. H.1, the curve with
equation
x3 + y3 = 3xy.
The curve crosses itself at the origin; we say it has a double point there. A line
through the origin with equation y = mx, m > 0, meets the curve again where

. The other roots of this cubic are both
x = 0, which means that the line through the origin meets the folium twice there.
So the algebraic test for tangents with which we began also picks up double points
on curves. The horizontal and vertical lines through the origin meet the curve triply
there, and are the only ones that look like tangents.
The recourse to counting points with multiplicity therefore requires attention be
paid to multiple points on curves.
In the course of the nineteenth century several attempts were made to say what
can be meant by points ‘at inﬁnity’, and the algebraic solution that ﬁnally emerged
was to move the problem into projective space.
Real projective (two-dimensional) space, as a set, consists of all the Euclidean
lines through the origin in R3; each Euclidean line is a point of projective space.
Each line through the origin contains the Euclidean points (at, bt, ct), t ∈R,
so the projective point corresponding to this Euclidean line is represented by
the coordinates [a, b, c]. Notice that we cannot have a = 0 = b = c, and
that this is the only restriction on a, b, c. Notice also that for all non-zero k the
projective point/Euclidean line [a, b, c] and [ak, bk, ck] are the same. For this
reason projective coordinates are often called homogeneous coordinates.
The projective point/Euclidean line [a, b, c] meets the Euclidean plane z = 1
where ct = 1, i.e. at the Euclidean point

 a
c , b

, unless c = 0, in which case the
Euclidean line and plane are parallel. This gives us a way of ‘seeing’ almost every
projective point/Euclidean line as a point, and if we also use the planes x = 1 and

H
Curves and Projective Space
395
y = 1 we can obtain pictures of every projective point/Euclidean line as a point if
we wish.
Suppose now we embed the Euclidean plane in Euclidean three-space as the set
of points (x, y, 1), thus
(x, y) →(x, y, 1).
We consider the Euclidean point (x, y, 1) as deﬁning the projective point [x, y, 1],
and if we write x =
X
Z , y =
Y
Z, we can think of this projective point as the
point [X, Y, Z]. Projective points with coordinates [X, Y, 0] are not the images of
Euclidean points by the above map, and capture the intuition of points ‘at inﬁnity’,
as we shall now see.
The equation of the parabola y = x2 in homogeneous coordinates is YZ = X2.
The projective points on it with coordinates [X, Y, Z], Z ̸= 0, have coordinates
[ X
Z , Y
Z, 1], and these correspond to Euclidean points in the plane z = 1 with
coordinates (x, y) that satisfy the equation y = x2. But there are also projective
points on the projectivised parabola with coordinates [X, Y, 0] for which YZ = X2.
In this case, this is the point [0, 1, 0].
The equation of the line x = 3 in its projectivised form is X = 3Z, and the
projective point [0, 1, 0] lies on this line. So in the projective plane the projective
line with equation X = 3Z meets the parabola in two points, of which [X, Y, Z] =
[3, 9, 1] is one and [0, 1, 0] is the other.
In this way, the intuition of points ‘at inﬁnity’ was eventually made rigorous.
Complex projective space is deﬁned in the same way, but with the real numbers
R replaced by the complex numbers C.
Intersections
A topic of increasing importance in nineteenth century mathematics was under-
standing curves through the common points of two given curves, say F(x, y) = 0
and G(x, y) = 0. The hope—often expressed as a theorem—was that any such
curve has an equation of the form
A(x, y)F(x, y) + B(x, y)G(x, y) = 0,
for some polynomials A(x, y) and B(x, y) determined by the curve.
For example, when f (x, y) = y −x2 and g(x, y) = y −9 their common points
are (3, 9) and (−3, 9). The curve y −x3 + 9x −9 = 0 passes through these two
points, and indeed
y −x3 + 9x −9 = −x(x2 −y) + (y −9)(1 −x) = −xf (x, y) + (1 −x)g(x, y).

396
H
Curves and Projective Space
More generally, if the given curves are Φ with equation F = 0 and Γ with
equation G = 0, and a curve Θ passes through their common points. It was,
and is, tempting to suppose that the equation for Θ is a linear combination of the
equations for Φ and Ψ , where the coefﬁcients are some polynomials in x and y.
More precisely, this condition is evidently sufﬁcient, and one might guess that it is
necessary.
However, we get into trouble immediately with the parabola Φ with equation
F(x, y) = y −x2 = 0 and the line Γ with equation G(x, y) = y = 0. They meet at
the origin, but consider the line with equation x −y = 0—or any line with equation
y −ax = 0, a ̸= 0. This line passes through the origin. But equations of the form
a(x, y)F + b(x, y)G = a(x, y)(y −x2) + b(x, y)y
all have no term in x alone, unlike x −y. So the claim seems to fail.
Of course, what has happened is that the parabola Φ and the line Γ are tangent
at the origin. If we ask for curves that pass through the origin and have a common
tangent with X and Y there—in this case the line Y, of course—we recover the
claim. Let us check that.
The condition that a curve with equation
H(x, y) = 0 = c00 + c10x + c01y + · · · + cjkxjyk + · · ·
passes through the origin is that c00 = 0. What is the condition that it has the line
y = 0 as a tangent there? From the equation H = 0 we deduce that Hxdx +
Hydy = 0, where Hx and Hy denote partial derivatives of H with respect to x and
y respectively. This means that
dy
dx = −Hx
Hy
,
so the condition is that Hx(0, 0) = 0. But
Hx(x, y) = 0 = c10 + · · ·

j>0,k
jcjkxj−1yk,
so
Hx(0, 0) = c10,
and we deduce that the condition is precisely that H also has no term in x alone.
This leads to the conjecture that the curves that pass with the ‘right multiplicity’
through the common points of two plane curves X and Y with equations F = 0 and
G = 0 respectively are the curves with equations of the form AF + BG = 0, where
A and B are polynomials in x and y.
Similar problems occur when Φ and Γ are allowed to be curves that have
multiple points.

Netto’s Theorem
In the notation of Chap. 24, Netto could write
R1(x) = (x −x1)μ1(x −x2)μ2 . . . (x −xk)μk,
where x1, x2, . . . , xk are the x-coordinates of the singular points and the correspond-
ing μ values are the degrees of the intersections. There was also a similar equation
for the y coordinates, with the same values for the exponents μ. His theorem was
that the highest value of the exponents μ1, μ2, . . . μk is the necessary value of r.
For example, let f (x, y) = xy and f1(x, y) = y−2x+x2, and consider the curve
with equation y = 0 that passes through their common intersections. It turns out that
while y cannot be written in the required form, y2 can be. Indeed, g(x) = 2 −x and
g1(x, y) = y satisfy
(2 −x)xy + y(y −2x + x2) = y2.
To ﬁnd this solution, we have to solve the equations

with the convention that apq or bpq is zero if either p < 0 or q < 0. In the case at
hand the coefﬁcient of xjyk is 1 if j = 0, k = 1 and zero otherwise. So whatever
else, we have a system of linear equations for the unknown coefﬁcients. Therefore,
we have to have enough equations to have a chance of solving them, and—the tricky
part—enough of the equations must be linearly independent. In the present case, it
is enough to let the polynomials g(x, y) and g1(x, y) be linear.
Now let’s try a harder case: let f (x, y) = x2 −y2 and f1(x, y) = x −y + x2,
and consider the curve with equation 2y −x2 = 0 that passes through their common
intersections, which are at (0, 0) and (−2, 2). Now, if we try to solve
⎛

j,k
ajkxjyk
⎞
⎠(x2 −y2) +
⎛
⎝
j,k
bjkxjyk
⎞
⎠(x −y + x2) = y −x2,
we ﬁnd that the equations for x and y say, respectively
b00 = 0, b00 = 1.
So the equation cannot be satisﬁed.
Netto’s theorem asks us to solve
(

j,k
ajkxjyk)(x2 −y2) + (

j,k
bjkxjyk)(x −y + x2) = (y −x2)r
for some integer r, so we could now try r = 2, but it too would lead to an
incompatible system of equations, and we would only succeed with r = 3. But
by now the algebra is becoming long and difﬁcult, and we are guided by our
understanding of the intersections of plane curves. The corresponding theory for
polynomials in more variables could not appeal to any such understanding of the
behaviour of surfaces or higher-dimensional varieties, so Hilbert’s work was that
much more impressive.
I.2
Resultants
Netto’s technique for ﬁnding the common zeros of two polynomials involved what
is called their resultant. Let f (x) = a0xk + a1xk−1 + · · · +k and f1(x) = b0xm +
b1xm−1 + · · · + bm be two polynomials of degrees k and m respectively. The key
result (which I shall not prove) is that f and f1 have a common factor if and only if
there are non-zero polynomials A(x) of degree at most m −1 and B(x) of degree at
most k −1 such that Af + Bf1 = 0.

I
Resultants
399
The thing to note is that the equation Af + Bf1 = 0 amounts to a system of
linear equations for the unknown coefﬁcients of A and B, and so they exist if and
only if the following determinant vanishes
                 
a0 a1 . . . ak

0 . . . 0

0
0 0 . . . 0 b1 b2 . . . bm
                 
.
Think of this as m rows of as followed by k rows of bs. It is called the resultant of
f and f1, written Res(f, f1, x).
In fact, polynomials A and B always exist so that
Af + Bf1 = Res(f, f1, x).
To give an example, let us take f (x) = x2 + 5x + 6 and f1(x) = x2 + x −2.
The determinant we must consider is
        
1 5 6
0
0 1 5

1 1 −2 0
0 1 1 −2
        
.
This vanishes, and so f and f1 must have a common factor—as indeed they do:
x + 2.
Netto knew that these results can be extended to polynomials in two variables, by
treating either variable as a parameter. In the ﬁrst example above, we have f (x, y) =
xy and f1(x, y) = y −2x + x2. We get a surprise: the resultants of these work out
to be
R1(x) = xy, R2(y) = xy2.
But if we make the change of variable replacing x by x and y by y + 2x, so f (x, y)
becomes x(y + 2x) and f1(x, y) becomes y + x2, their resultants are
R1(x) = x2(2 −x), R2(y) = y2(4 + y).
These correctly locate the coordinates of the common points of the curves: (0, 0)
(twice) and (2, −4). What went wrong was that in the ﬁrst expressions f was not of
maximal degree in x.

400
I
Resultants
In our second example there is no need to transform the variables, and we ﬁnd
the resultants of f (x, y) = x2 −y2 and f1(x, y) = x −y + x2 are
R1(x) = −x3(x + 2), R2(y) = y3(y −2).
This conﬁrms that there is a triple zero at (0, 0) and a further zero at (2, −2).

Other Accounts of the History of Galois Theory
Galois theory is a difﬁcult subject for beginners, and traditionally appears as an
option for ﬁnal year students. It has therefore attracted a number of treatments,
several of which have much to offer their readers, and it is surely likely that some
of the charm of these books is the effort that the authors have made to explain this
or that part of history and the mathematics properly to themselves.
All recent histories of the subject have taken their cue from the long and well-
researched paper (Kiernan 1971). This paper more or less mapped out a journey
from Lagrange to Artin, and so from the ﬁrst substantial study of the quintic equa-
tion to the creation of the modern theory as a branch of structural, modern algebra.
Among the important critical comments have been those of van der Waerden (1972),
who argued for a different interpretation of Artin’s work, Dean (2009), who argued
that Dedekind had already presented the ‘Galois correspondence’ in the 1870s,
and Brechenmacher (2011), who argued for a closer reading of Galois’s work, as
discussed in Chap. 14 above.
The constraints of the course forced me to suppress most eighteenth century
developments. Among books largely or wholly devoted to the history of Galois
theory, the account in Tignol (2001) is particularly good on the eighteenth century
part of the story. It is, for example, richly informative about Lagrange, and
also Vandermonde, who is omitted in my account, and valuable for its proof
of some mathematical facts about the symmetric functions that I have taken for
granted. Galuzzi’s historically sensitive Lectures (2014) are also very helpful for
the mathematics involved in the work of Lagrange and Galois.
Abel’s contribution is always difﬁcult to describe precisely, and a gentle account
that nicely brings out its importance is Pesic (2003). Another good account aimed
more at mathematicians is Cooke (2008).

also the reduction of the quintic and the computation of Galois groups is well
presented in Bewersdorff (2006).

Other Books on the History of Algebraic Number Theory
The deﬁnitive work here, as I have already remarked, is Goldstein, Schappacher,
and Schwermer’s The Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss’s Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae (2007).
Weil’s Number theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legen-
dre (1984) stops with Legendre, although he also wrote some interesting essays on
cyclotomy, and is richly informative about the period before Gauss.
Scharlau and Opolka (1984) remains the best introduction to Dirichlet’s work on
number theory that we have, but it is only part of a small book with a large agenda
and we still lack a full-length account of this most important mathematician. There
is the mathematical biography by Elstrodt (2007), and the collection of sources
produced by Biermann (1959) that are in German and out of print.
Goldman (1998) is very helpful on the topics it covers, and it goes much further
than I have done.
In the last few years there has been some very good work on different aspects of
Dedekind’s work: Avigad (2006), Ferreirós (2007), Dean (2009), Reck (2012) and
the references cited there, and Hafner (forthcoming).
Kronecker has long had a friend in Harold Edwards, whose works should always
be consulted.
Although there is an abundance of literature on Emmy Noether, it is likely that
Colin McLarty’s forthcoming book, the ﬁrst to consider all of her work, will greatly
change our picture of her and add to our sense of her achievements.
Lemmermeyer (2000) takes a major strand of number theory from the mid-
18th to the mid-nineteenth century in more mathematical detail than I have been
able to, and has many interesting things to say on the way. His and Schappacher’s
introduction to the English edition of Hilbert’s Zahlbericht is also valuable.
Robert Langlands, one of the leading ﬁgures in number theory in the second half
of the twentieth century, has published a series of lectures on number theory from a
rich historical perspective at www.math.duke.edu/langlands.
