Abstract 
 
The research project The Effects of the Intergenerational Residential 
School Experience and Negative Racial Stereotyping on Ojibwe Speech Patterns 
in mid-Northern Ontario Anishnawbek was undertaken in the Sagamok 
Anishnawbek First Nation area of mid-Northern Ontario.  It was anticipated that 
three groups of participants would participate: 1) speakers who attended 
residential school and who lost then subsequently regained their fluency; 2) 
speakers whose parent(s) attended residential school; and 3) speakers who did 
not attend or who had minimal attendance at residential school and who never 
lost their fluency.  Instead, two groups of self-identified Ojibwe speakers 
emerged: 1) those who did not attend the Indian Residential School (IRS) system 
and 2) those who did attend the IRS system.  Within Group Two, three sub-
groups were identified: those who only attended a day school (sub-group A); 
those who only attended a residential school (sub-group B); and those who 
attended both institutions (sub-group C).   
 
 A four-part questionnaire was developed and utilized for the research 
project: the first part consisted of a 32 component Nishnaabemwin (Ojibwe 
language) performance assessment with thirty questions and two short narratives 
while the other three parts focused on issues related to 1) personal background 
regarding the IRS system, 2) personal views about negative racist stereotypes, 
and 3) fluency.  
 
Four key findings of the research project are: 1) there is a strong co-
relation between a lower Nishnaabemwin performance assessment, a longer  

 
 
ii 
length of attendance in the IRS system and a negative rating of this experience;  
2) intergenerational Ojibwe language transmission appears to be the most 
significant effect of the IRS system as members from both Groups One and Two 
consciously and sub-consciously chose to not speak Ojibwe to their children; 3) 
the day school experience was ranked more negatively than the residential 
school experience; and 4) all of the participants experienced racism and negative 
stereotyping in varying degrees that included a negative impact on 
Nishnaabemwin usage while exhibiting a resilience in overcoming this historic 
trauma. 
 
The project revealed that Sub-group C had the highest scores on the 
Nishnaabemwin performance assessment and also gave the most positive 
ratings for their IRS system experience.  Significant internal variation and 
diversity in the Nishnaabemwin utilized by the speakers from Sagamok 
Anishnawbek was also documented and only one instance of semantic 
broadening could be co-related to attendance in the IRS system.  Finally, it was 
identified that sociolinguistic factors such as standardization of Nishnaabemwin 
and lateral violence need to be considered when determining changes to the 
language.

Dedication 
 
I dedicate this work to my greatest teacher, of not just Nishnaabemwin but 
also life, my mother, Maanii Aan, to my children Anangoons, Memegwaans and 
Ezaakoons, to the research participants, to Sagamok Anishnawbek, to those who 
have passed on leaving their gift of language with us and to all those unborn who 
will carry this gift of Nishnaabemwin. 
 
Throughout my academic experience and through my community work 
with Nishnaabemwin, my most important goal has been personal, for most of all, I 
want to speak better Nishnaabemwin and pass that onto my children.  This thesis 
is part of that journey to reclaim my mother tongue as it keeps me active and 
focused on Nishnaabemwin.  It is part of a journey to stop the disconnect in our 
communities between fluent speakers and second language learners.  It is also 
to help Nishnaabemwin survive in our hearts and in our homes, in our schools 
and band offices, in our prayers and in our stories, and with our children, our 
grandchildren and all those unborn.

CHAPTER ONE: Introduction 
1.1 Rationale 
 
The rationale of this research project is both personal and academic.  I am 
the first generation of children in my family who were not picked up or sent to a 
residential school.  Growing up I was told that my father went to a boarding 
school and when I was around ten years old, my family went to a reunion at his 
old school.  But other than that I did not know anything about the seemingly 
benign Indian Residential School (IRS) system.  I knew a bit more about the day 
school on the reserve from the stories my mother told me.   
 
In the 1970s and '80s, Nishnaabemwin was heard regularly and fluently 
inside the home and in the community.  Although there was more expectation 
especially from my father to learn and speak English and French, I was strongly 
inclined to speak my language from a young age, undoubtedly in part from the 
strong relationships that I have with my mother and my now deceased paternal 
grandfather.   So a journey began.  It included constantly besieging my mother for 
help, poring over Basil Johnston's texts, attending Trent University Ojibwe 
classes with Shirley Williams and a Sagamok Anishnawbek immersion program 
with Barb Nolan, graduating with a degree in Ojibwe Linguistics from the 
Saskatchewan Indian Federated College, assisting with a non-profit organization 
that is dedicated to First Nation language survival, coordinating both a 
SaskCulture funded documentary entitled Giigidoowin: Speaking Language 
Project and a weekly language circle at a public library, teaching Ojibwe, 

 
 
2 
continuing work on an Ojibwe resource book, Nookoomis Kidwenan, and finally a 
Master's program in Indigenous Studies and Linguistics.   
 
 For all that I had seen, read, heard or felt over the past thirty some years, 
I noticed certain patterns about language loss, language retention, and language 
revitalization.  The most obvious one was how quickly you can forget something 
when you do not use it regularly.  I had to make a conscious effort to remember 
and to speak.  Many people would tell me that they did not learn their language 
because they went to a residential school or that their parents didn't teach them 
because of their experiences in the residential school.  I also heard stories of 
personal trauma that seemed to hinder people from speaking or learning 
Nishnaabemwin.  I quickly realized how fortunate I was that my mother 
maintained her first language, that she did not go to a residential school and that 
my upbringing allowed for a safe, nurturing environment for language retention. 
 
If it was at times hard to remember and speak Nishnaabemwin, it was also 
hard to listen because I did not find many fluent speakers when I moved away 
from Sagamok Anishnawbek.  My language revitalization relied mainly on long 
distance phone calls to my mother, language tapes and a collection of 
Nishnaabemwin resources from the late Virginia Henry and Art McGregor in 
Ontario to Anton Treuer's community anthologies in Minnesota. 
 
I pursued a Masters program because I wanted to find answers for my 
own questions.  Specifically, I wanted to examine the effects of 1) the 
intergenerational Indian Residential School impact as well as 2) negative racial 
stereotyping by mainstream society on Ojibwe speech patterns.  I proposed to 

 
 
3 
interview three groups of Ojibwe speakers: 1) speakers who attended residential 
school and who lost then subsequently regained their Ojibwe fluency; 2) 
speakers whose parent(s) attended residential school; and 3) speakers who did 
not attend or had minimal attendance at residential school and who never lost 
their fluency in Ojibwe.  In order to determine whether there are any significant 
differences between the forms of Ojibwe spoken by these three groups, 
interviews include the recording of two short narratives and responses to a 
language performance assessment.   
 
The recordings would then undergo linguistic analysis to determine any 
differences in speech patterns between the groups of speakers such as possible 
change in the morphology, syntax, phonology and semantics of Nishnaabemwin.  
The research will make several important contributions.  Linguistically, it will point 
to the manner and patterns of linguistic change under the particular 
circumstances described above.  Of equal importance, the findings may be used 
to inform those seeking pedagogical methodologies in language education as to 
ways in which language revival may be achieved.  If, for instance, very little 
change is found in the Ojibwe speech of the groups, the question can be asked 
how educators might duplicate the means in which Nishnaabemwin was retained 
or regained for the participants. 
1.2 Research Paradigm 
 
In researching and writing my thesis, I utilized the framework of the 
Historical Trauma Transmission (HTT) theory and as such propose to illustrate 
how 1) the historic relationship between First Nations and Euro-Canadians, 2) the 

 
 
4 
intergenerational traumatic environment created by the IRS system within 
Aboriginal communities as well as 3) current negative racial stereotyping are not 
conducive to the maintenance of Nishnaabemwin, the language of the 
Nishnaabek. 
 
The endemic problems facing Indigenous people have caused many 
historians, social workers, researchers, psychologists and other professionals to 
develop theories to explain this situation in the hopes of addressing the needs 
and creating solutions for these problems.  HTT is one such theory that provides 
the most encompassing explanation for the persistent problems facing Aboriginal 
peoples.  
 
In 1988, Dr. Yellow Horse Brave Heart developed "theoretical constructs 
describing historical unresolved grief, historical trauma, and historical trauma 
response" (Brave Heart, 1998a, p. 288).  Historical trauma (HT) is defined as 
cumulative trauma - collective and compounding emotional and psychic 
wounding (Niederland, 1989) - both over the life span and across generations 
(Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998b, p. 288).  Historical trauma response (HTR) is 
"conceptualized as a constellation of features associated with a reaction to 
massive group trauma" (Brave Heart, Chase, Elkins & Altschul, 2011, p. 283). 
This constellation of features includes those for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD) and psychic trauma (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998b, p. 288).  HT and 
HTR are comparable to the survivor syndrome of Jewish Holocaust survivors and 
their descendants.  Historic Unresolved Grief (HUG) refers to the lack of 
traditional healing interventions that would have let Indigenous people resolve 

 
 
5 
HTR with the result that the trauma manifested and was transmitted inter-
generationally.  Brave Heart asserts that education about HT and HTR will create 
an awareness of the nature and scope of both as well as removing the personal 
stigma and blame that is associated with intergenerational HTR.  This awareness 
will allow an opportunity to resolve the HTR through culturally appropriate healing 
methodologies that are specific for each particular individual and group.  
Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief Intervention (HUTG) is utilized to assist 
in resolving historic trauma (Brave Heart, 1998a; Brave Heart et al, 2011).   
 
Brave Heart encourages and recommends further research in order to 
better resolve HT, specifically for other factors such as "continuing oppression" 
and "harsh day school experiences, and of the generational influence of parental 
and grandparental boarding school attendance on current experiences of child 
abuse, neglect, and psychosocial symptoms"(Brave Heart, 1998a, p. 301; Brave 
Heart et al., 2011, p.287).  It is also recommended that there is a need to 
consider "tribal cultural distinctiveness and differing degrees of trauma exposure"  
and to assess HT as it affects the individual, the family and the community as 
well as identify areas of "strength and resilience" among those who endured 
HT(Brave Heart et al., p. 287).  
 
 HTT theory has been expanded upon to include the development of the 
Historical Loss Scale (HLS) which measures how often people think about 
historic trauma and the Historical Loss and Associated Symptoms (HLAS) tool 
that measures 'emotional responses' to historic trauma (Brave Heart et al, 2011) 
as well as the application of HTT theory to the Canadian Indigenous experience 

 
 
6 
(Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004).  For the purposes of this research 
project, HTT theory is an explanatory model of the factors affecting 
Nishnaabemwin and as such did not involve a direct intervention methodology 
that utilized HTUG, HLAS or HLS.  The methodology is described in more detail 
in the following section 1.3. 
 
While historic trauma and the Indian Residential School system is 
generally referred to as cultural genocide most notably by the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, the term genocide is equally applicable (Tomascik & 
Frechette, 2012; Wesley-Esquimaux, 2004).  Genocide is noted as: 
 "an organized, planned action to destroy, in whole or in part, a 
national, ethnical, racial or religious group.  Genocide may manifest 
itself in killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or 
mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring 
about its physical destruction, in whole or in part, and forcibly  
transferring children of one group to another group." (Wesley-
Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004, p. 56) 
 
This is more in keeping with the ideas and principles that the founder of 
the term genocide, Raphael Lemkin, developed.  Before and during the time 
when the term genocide was being developed by lawyer and scholar, Raphael 
Lemkin, he was researching and writing about settler colonialism and the 
genocide in the Americas (Docker, 2010; McDonnell & Moses, 2005).  In Axis 
Rule in Occupied Europe (1944), Lemkin wrote that: 

 
 
7 
"Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the 
immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by 
mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to 
signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the 
destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, 
with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.  The objectives 
of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and 
social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, 
religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and 
the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, 
and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups. 
Genocide is directed against the national group as an entity, and 
the actions involved are directed against individuals, not in their 
individual capacity, but as members of the national group." p. 79 
[emphasis mine] 
 
Lemkin added to this definition by stating that genocide has "two phases: one, 
destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group; the other, the 
imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor.  This imposition, in turn, may 
be made upon the oppressed population which is allowed to remain or upon the 
territory alone, after removal of the population and the colonization by the 
oppressor's own nationals" (p.79). 
 
It is clear from just three incidents in Canadian history, the massacre of 
the Beothuk tribe (Pastore, 1993), the "politics of starvation" and "clearing the 

 
 
8 
plains" in Canada's west (Daschuk, 2013) as well as the forced attendance in the 
IRS system that was designed to forcefully eradicate Aboriginal culture and 
language which are cornerstones of individual and national identity, that 
genocide is appropriate terminology for the mostly traumatic events that 
Aboriginal people faced after contact with Europeans.  It is even more 
appropriate in light of the medical experimentation that included deprivation of 
nutrition from select groups of students at residential schools which showed 
wanton disregard for the lives of the students entrusted to the care of the 
government (CBC News, 2000; Hastings, 2013; Mosby, 2013;Porter, 2013; 
Ulrichsen, 2013). 
 
Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski (2004) expand upon HTT theory and 
hypothesize that Indigenous people were constantly inundated by the effects of 
contact with Europeans : disease and epidemics; alcoholism; cultural disruption 
through the introduction of new worldviews and social order; warfare; colonialism; 
slavery; economic shift; dispossession of territory; increased European 
settlement as well as the IRS system.  Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski (2004) 
also add to the theory of intergenerational transmission of HTR by including the 
following modes of transmission; "biological (in hereditary predispositions to 
PTSD), cultural (through story-telling, culturally sanctioned behaviours), social 
(through inadequate parenting, lateral violence, acting out of abuse), and 
psychological (through memory processes)" (p. 76). 
 
Although there are similar theories to HTT, most notably complex Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the Indian Residential School Syndrome 

 
 
9 
(IRSS) as well as the more recent Structural Racism/Violence and Post-Colonial 
Distress, HTT is the most encompassing theory for understanding and assisting 
with healing the effects of the IRS system.  Herman (1997) introduced the theory 
of complex PTSD for individual responses to psychogenic trauma that includes "a 
history of subjugation to totalitarian control over a prolonged period [of time] 
(months to years)"and examples of this include "hostages, prisoners of war, 
concentration camp survivors and survivors of some religious cults...those 
subjected to totalitarian systems in sexual and domestic life, including survivors 
of domestic battering, childhood physical or sexual abuse and organized sexual 
exploitation" (p. 121).  It is noted that PTSD, although similar in symptoms to 
HTT, is limited to a singular traumatic event with a 'beginning and an end' while 
HTT includes all of the historic trauma suffered by a people (Wesley-Esquimaux 
& Smolewski, 2004, p. 55).   
 
IRSS, however, expands upon the theory of PTSD, by including family 
members of those who attended a residential school, identifying a lack of 
knowledge and interest with traditional Aboriginal culture and substance abuse 
with violent outbreaks (Brasfield, 2001; Robertson, 2006).  IRSS is therefore 
more encompassing in that it allows for intergenerational effects of the IRS 
system.  It is also argued that IRSS "allows for an externalizing of mental health 
issues with reference to anti-colonial understandings"(Robertson, 2006, p. 17).  
IRSS is limited, however, in that it does not address the full extent of historic 
trauma that affects Aboriginal people and which makes them more vulnerable to 

 
 
10 
social dysfunction and less able to cope with the direct impacts and inter-
generational effects of the IRS system.   
 
HTT theory is criticized for being both 'pan-Indian' in its analysis of history 
and healing methodology yet also for being "difficult to generate conclusions that 
apply broadly given the variance of HTT across Canada, regionally, locally and 
individually (Bombay, Matheson & Anisman, 2014, p. 323).  It is important to 
remember that while not all peoples suffered the same, they suffered 
nonetheless and undoubtedly all require some form of cultural and personal 
healing intervention.  HTT theory stresses that it is the goal of each community to 
find their story, find their voice, 'decolonize their history', and understand how 
their history is similar to the history of all Aboriginal people, even to all oppressed 
people subject to genocide.  HTT theory also emphasizes the importance of 
adapting and 're-working' healing methods to the individual and to the community 
(Brave Heart et al, 2011; Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004).  As noted in 
the aforementioned, neither aspect of HTT is pan-Indian since the focus is on the 
individual or community reclaiming their own unique history and developing their 
own healing strategies.  While broadly applied conclusions may be difficult to 
generate due to each unique individual, local and regional response to HTT, it is 
always possible to learn from the experiences of others who have undergone the 
HTT analysis and resolution process and adapt them to their own experiences. 
 
Structural racism or structural violence is another model posited as a 
means to explain conditions in Indigenous communities (Juutilainen, Miller, 
Heikkila & Rautio, 2014; Kirmayer, Gone & Moses, 2014).  Structural racism "is 

 
 
11 
defined as the macro-level systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and 
processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities 
among racial and ethnic groups (Powell, 2008)" (Juutilainen et al, 2014, p. 1).  
Structural violence refers to ongoing oppression and "persistent suffering of 
Indigenous peoples" (Kirmayer et al, 2014, p. 301).  Kirmayer et al (2014) also 
posits the theory of post colonial distress as being more appropriate for 
explaining Canadian Indigenous past and present socio-economic circumstances 
(p. 301).  This theory utilizes four key concepts: colonial injury; collective 
experience; cumulative effects; and cross-generational impacts of these injuries 
(p. 301). 
 
Kirmayer et al (2014) in the attempt to dismiss the effectiveness of HTT, 
makes a comparison of historical trauma experienced by Indigenous people with 
the Shoah or Holocaust as experienced by Jewish people.  It is stated that the 
Shoah is a result of a deliberate policy of extermination while the Indigenous 
situation is a result of colonial expansion and expropriation (Kirmayer et al, 2014, 
p. 303).  In doing so, Kirmayer et al (2014) is ignoring the very deliberate policies 
of the Canadian government that sought to eliminate its "Indian problem" via the 
Indian Residential School system and other federal legislation and policy that 
included misappropriation of First Nation's land and monies held in trust, the 
"politics of starvation" in the western provinces of Canada (Daschuk, 2013) as 
well as the earlier extermination of the Beothuk (Passmore, 1993).  He is also 
ignoring the American policy of hunting 'red skins' that affected many First 
Nations that lived within the boundaries of both Canada and the United States of 

 
 
12 
America (King, 2012; Loewen, 1995).  This historic trauma suffered by 
Indigenous people is minimized by Kirmayer et al (2014) when attention is drawn 
to the duration of the Holocaust and that of the 'colonial oppression' suffered by 
Indigenous people as though the only real trauma is that of the Jewish Holocaust 
due to the nature of the extreme actions taken in a short period of time.  Not only 
does this minimize the Canadian Indigenous historic trauma experience, it 
minimizes all other world instances of historic trauma such as that of the Khmer 
Rouge in Cambodia, the Holodomor in Russia or the other ethnic minorities killed 
during the Nazi reign over most of Europe.   
 
Kirmayer et al (2014, p. 301) also posits that resilience can be 
epigenetically transferred as much as the effects of trauma as though this 
somehow should eliminate the need to use the term historic trauma to describe 
the Canadian Indigenous experience.  It is also suggested that HTT's focus is 
only on past events and not current factors influencing conditions in Indigenous 
communities.  As discussed earlier, HTT does account for such variations in 
individual and community response to historic trauma and also discusses the 
need to look at other factors contributing to historic trauma including ongoing 
oppression.  Kirmayer et al notes that the children of Holocaust survivors are 
doing better than their parents on an educational and income level however, this 
is not true for children of IRS attendees and it is suggested that this is a good 
reason to not espouse HTT.  What Kirmayer et al forgets in this analysis is that 
HTT does not just look at the IRS as the factor in HT but as one of several factors 
including ongoing oppression.  Kirmayer also discusses the focus on 

 
 
13 
psychotherapy in HTT and states that it may not work to fully resolve other 
political and economic issues.  Again, there is no discussion of Brave Heart's 
assertions to let HTT evolve to include ongoing oppression (this would include 
political and economic issues) nor that each community will develop a healing 
intervention model that can supersede psychotherapy if that will best suit the 
needs of the community.  This could be incredibly empowering on a self-
determining and Indigenous ownership level which is identified as a key social 
determinant of Indigenous health and well being (Loppie-Reading & Wien, 2009)  
and which structural racism and post-colonial distress theories do not appear to 
advocate for.   
 
Overall, the terms structural violence, structural racism and postcolonial 
distress semantically weaken the experience of Canadian Indigenous people and 
do not accurately convey the depth and the duration of the experiences that 
Indigenous people have endured.  This impact that has manifested in differing 
forms over the generations is what HTT theory seeks to create awareness of as 
well as healing strategies geared to the individual and the community. 
 
Lastly, there may be some basic resistance to the HTT theory simply 
because of the stigma attached to the labels of dysfunctional and historic trauma 
terminology.  Denials mask the reality of the past and present situations in 
Indigenous communities, urban or on-reserve, for historic trauma affects the 
community around each individual.  Resilience did not make one oblivious to the 
chronic social disarray caused by historic trauma nor did positive experiences 
mean that one was oblivious to the fact that too many children in the IRS system 

 
 
14 
suffered and remained forever silent when they took their own lives.  Yet historic 
trauma is also personal not just communal.  People have to arrive at their own 
time in life when they acknowledge the inhumanities and injustices that occurred 
and are still occurring inter-generationally.  Then will be that time that they can 
move forward, past painful memories and dark emotions, towards a better future 
for all people.   
1.3 Methodology 
1.3.1 Community Engagement 
 
The research project Effects of the Intergenerational Residential School 
Experience and Negative Racial Stereoyping on Ojibwe Speech Patterns in Mid-
Northern Ontario Anishnawbek received formal approval from the Regina Ethics 
Board on June 12, 2013 (Appendix A).  An initial information letter had been sent 
to the Chief and Council of Sagamok Anishnawbek on April 3, 2013 that informed 
them about the intent of the research project pending Regina Ethics Board 
approval (Appendix B).  The researcher also discussed the intent of the research 
project with the Director of Education and the Director of Community Wellness.  
Arrangements were made to provide copies of the final thesis to both 
departments.  When approval was received a final contact letter (Appendix C) 
along with a community engagement poster (Appendix D) was sent to the Chief 
and Council on June 14, 2013.   
 
In keeping with Claire Bowern's (2008) criteria for sound research 
methods, one of the goals of the research project was to have an inclusive group 
of language speakers as participants.  Shortly after the researcher's arrival in the 

 
 
15 
Sagamok Anishnawbek area, community engagement posters were placed in 
public areas in the community such as the Band Office, the Health Centre, in 
private establishments such as convenience stores and restaurants as well as 
public areas outside of the community.  The researcher met with both the 
Director of Community Wellness, Eileen Smith, and the Cultural Resource 
Worker, Leroy Bennett, to discuss the services available.  These meetings were 
follow-ups from earlier telephone conversations regarding the type of services 
available in the community that could assist in off-setting any risk associated with 
recalling a personal traumatic event that might be part of the research project 
interview process. 
 
Contact with the participants was usually made informally and at times 
indirectly with the researcher.  It always seemed that 'someone knew someone' 
and this was very helpful.  A pre-existing network of kinship and friendship 
provided the best means for interest in the research project to be generated and 
eventually communicated to the researcher.  The researcher discussed the 
research project as well as other language-focused issues with all those who 
initiated it regardless of whether they participated in the research project or not.  
The researcher also met with the participants beforehand to explain the process 
and the goal of the research project so that participants would have a bit of time 
to consider the implications of the research project before they agreed to 
participate.  At this time or shortly afterwards, if participants were still willing to 
take part, an interview time was set up at a location that was convenient for the 
participant.   

 
 
16 
1.3.2 The Researcher  
 
The researcher is from the community of Sagamok Anishnawbek and is a 
registered band member of said community.  The researcher grew up in the 
community but does not live there although members of her immediate family still 
reside on-reserve and she has visited regularly.  Statistically, the researcher has 
become categorized as an 'off-reserve' or 'urban' member.  This categorization 
will be elaborated upon in Chapter 6.  
1.3.3 Research Participants 
 
The community of Sagamok Anishnawbek, located on the north shore of 
Lake Huron, approximately 225 km east of Sault Ste. Marie on Highway 17 and 
120 km west of Sudbury, is home for the Anishnawbek -the Ojibwe, Odawa and 
Potawatomi people.  Sagamok Anishnawbek has a history of relations with both 
Scottish and French fur traders as well as a diverse population that includes 
members and ancestral families from other nearby communities such as Birch 
Island First Nation, Serpent River First Nation, Wikwemkong First Nation and 
further south into Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oklahoma (Wilder & 
Wemigwans, 1999; Gamble & Elder Tea, 2013).1  Sagamok Anishnawbek, 
through intermarriage and migration, is also home to members of the Algonquin 
and Cree nations.2  On June, 2014, the registered population for Sagamok 
Anishnawbek was 2, 780 with 1,548 members living on Sagamok Anishnawbek 
and 1,232 living off the reserve (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development 
                                                           
1 This is also attestable from local accounts including the researcher's own personal ancestral history.

17 
Canada, 2014).  These numbers would have been fairly representative of the 
population when the research was conducted.   
 
From this culturally rich community came the majority of the eleven self-
identified Ojibwe language speaking participants for the research project.  The 
one exception was a participant who declared membership with Serpent River 
First Nation, a neighbouring First Nation community although she resided on 
Sagamok Anishnawbek for a period during her life.  Overall, the 10 participants 
were 0.36% of the total registered population of Sagamok Anishnawbek (2,780)  
The age range of the participants was from 84 to 42 with the median age being 
62.  Most of the participants were female with the male to female ratio being 
three to eight respectively.  
 
Although three groups were expected, the two groups that emerged were: 
Group 1) those who did not attend the IRS system with five participants and 
Group 2) those who attended the IRS system with six participants.  Of the second 
group, three sub-groups were identified: three participants who only attended a 
day school (sub-group A); one participant who only attended a residential school 
(sub-group B); and two participants who attended both institutions (sub-group C).  
1.3.4 Interview Process 
 
The researcher developed a four part questionnaire for the research 
project.  The first part consisted of a 32 component language performance 
assessment on Nishnaabemwin.  This consisted of 30 questions and two short 
narratives.  The other three parts involved the participants' self-perceptions on 
issues related to: 1) personal background regarding Indian Residential School; 2) 

 
 
18 
personal views about negative racist stereotypes; and 3) fluency.  The questions 
were open and close-ended and designed to illicit self-perception responses. 
 
Once the participant consent form (Appendix E) was read through with the 
participant and approval was provided for the audio-recording, the interview 
process began.  The audio-recording occurred only for Part I of the research 
questionnaire, that which dealt with oral Nishnaabemwin.  The other three parts 
were recorded in writing by the researcher.  This approach was utilized in order 
to record linguistic accuracy for Part I and to allow a more relaxed, less invasive 
approach for the remaining three Parts that involved sharing more emotional and 
personal information.  Depending on the answers, the length of the interview 
varied, however, on average, the interview process was approximately one hour 
in length.  After the interview process, the researcher went through a debriefing 
process with the participant using a debriefing script and providing a Community 
Resources List for their use if so desired.  The researcher utilized culturally 
appropriate honoraria for the participants and when possible, checked back with 
the participants a few days after the interview.  
 
The results were transcribed and sent to the mailing addresses provided 
by the participants with a specific time frame for revising responses.  This did not 
happen with the exception of one participant who mailed back some small 
changes.  Two participants' packages were returned to the researcher by post 
marked as unclaimed. 
 
 

 
 
19 
1.3.5 Analysis 
 
A comparative linguistic analysis was made of the participants' responses 
to the language performance assessment excluding the last two questions that 
asked for personal choice narratives.  This is further elaborated upon in section 
6.1.1.  There is no comparative analysis with any other linguistic or non-linguistic 
works on Nishnaabemwin meaning that the answers that were provided were not 
cross-referenced with what has been documented earlier in other areas.  There 
are several reasons for this, the main one being the primacy of the research 
project's participants' oral history regarding Nishnaabemwin.  Babcock (2012-
2013) when describing how Indigenous oral histories have been 'demeaned' as 
'primitive,' 'uncivilized' and viewed as' the antithesis of written histories' that are 
subject to the bias of the recording historian, quotes both Glen Stohr and Alistair 
Thomson: 
 "But oral histories are not the precursors of written histories, or 
even a means of filling a gap when written history is incomplete. 
They occupy their own important place in reconstructing and 
reinvigorating the past, and may "evoke recollections and under-
standings that were  previously silenced or ignored" (p.35). 
  
 
 
While oral history is typically meant to consist of traditional cultural stories 
or community histories (part of this research project does include individual 
histories that comprise part of a community history), the research participants are 
transmitting their linguistic history as given to them by their teachers whether they 
are parents, older siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts and as such, their 

 
 
20 
linguistic history should be accorded the status of oral history.  The status of 
which should not be diminished in any way because it is not written. 
 
Secondly, while some Nishnaabemwin projects have documented  
speakers in a state or provincial region (Treuer, 2001; Valentine, 2001) or in 
some cases a broader area from Wisconsin and Minnesota to both north-western 
and central Ontario (Jones, Jourdain & Tainter, 2011), only a few have focused 
on single communities (Artuso,1998; Aubin, 1998).  This research project is 
unique in that it is one of the few research projects that focuses specifically on 
the speech patterns of two groups, one composed of sub-groups, who are from 
the same community.  It follows that comparisons are made within the group as 
this reflects the nature and the scope of the research project.  There is no need 
to assume a standard derived from outside sources or reference materials and 
then compare the research project's findings to it although assistance with 
linguistic analysis from such sources may be appropriate for some of the 
terminology. 
 
Thirdly, the diversity of the Ojibwe language needs to be better advanced 
particularly in the research context.  Ojibwe or Nishnaabemwin, is part of the 
Algonquian language family and is known by many names, Chippewa, Odawa, 
Saulteaux, Nakawewin, Pottawatimi, however, Nishnaabemwin, appears to be 
the most encompassing term to use for the language.  Nishnaabemwin is centred 
primarily in the Ontario Great Lakes region, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and 
extends westward into Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Montana.  
Valentine (2001) noted that it is very important to consider that there is "much 

 
 
21 
local variation" and "that a given word may behave somewhat differently for 
different speakers" (p.175).  There are also many historical factors to consider 
when studying dialect differences (Valentine, 2001, p. 17).  Despite there being 
many different dialects, the core essence of the language is the same in all.  
Nichols (1988, p. viii) has also noted that "the language in all its diversity of 
dialect and usages has not yet been well-documented."  This is something that 
the current research project contributes to by illustrating the rich, complex 
diversity of Nishnaabemwin within a single community. 
 
 
Lastly, there are fundamental issues with the manner in which some 
previous research on Nishnaabemwin has been conducted.  Bowern (2008) sets 
outs some very pertinent criteria and states that it is important to have more than 
one informant to ensure that " you are able to hear the language from more than 
one person and you are also able to 'reduce the chance of biasing your 
description of the language towards a single speaker's idiolect"(p. 65).  It is also 
noted that: 
"no language is without variation and even languages with few
 speakers may be diverse (cf Dorian 1994).  Therefore which variety
 or varieties of the language you describe will also be important, and 
may require negotiation.  One variety might be more prestigious 
than another, or lects might differ greatly depending on the age, 
class or gender of its speakers.  Jeff Good (pers. comm.) has 
introduced the term 'doculect' to refer to the variety of the 'language' 
that ends up in the documentation." (Bowern, 2008, p. 8) 

 
 
22 
 
 
Thus the bias of the researcher or linguist when ethnocentrism flourished 
unchallenged by academe was critical.  Who the researcher deemed to be 
important enough to record (and the criteria used to determine that) will still be 
the source that is available and relied upon today. 
 
An example of this Ojibwe language work of Leonard Bloomfield and 
associates who usually recorded one informant from one community rather than 
several members as was the case with Andrew Medler of Walpole Island for 
Eastern Ojibwa: Grammatical Sketch, Texts and Word List, Angeline Williams of 
Sugar Island for The Dog's Children: Anishinaabe Texts Told by Angeline 
Williams and Gregor McGregor of Birch Island for An Ojibwe Text Anthology.  All 
three informants were utilized for the documentation of the Ojibwe language by 
C.F. Voegelin and Leonard Bloomfield.  This would have definitely limited the 
range of speech patterns within a dialect and within a community.  What also 
emerges about Bloomfield's research methods is the technique that Charles F. 
Voegelin recalls using when working with the texts in the field methods classes 
such as the one used for The Dog's Children: Anishinaabe Texts Told by 
Angeline Williams: 
 "Well, this is how we worked (without tape recorders, which 
postdate World War II).  The Ojibwa speaker would dictate a text - 
anecdotal, autobiographic or folkloristic - in non-casual style (slow 
enough so that we could transcribe, much as one dictates a letter to 
a typist lacking training in shorthand).  One had to guard against a 
word by word rendering in which words are said in citation form; 

 
 
23 
also against a sentence by sentence rendering which would have 
overtaxed our phonetic memories in transcribing.  What was wanted 
was a phrase by phrase rendering which would give us phonetic 
information to distinguish internal sandhi, and provide a span short 
enough to remember in transcription.  Repetitions could then be 
elicited, but not replication of the kind that is nowadays obtainable 
by playing back a previous segment on the tape; the phonetic 
repetitions we obtained typically varied from the original model, and 
it was these that were classified as 'free variants." (Bloomfield & 
Nichols, 1991, p.9)  
 
 
One of the foremost questions raised by this passage was whether 
slowing down the speech of a fluent Ojibwe speaker had any bearing on how the 
language was recorded in written form.  It is not possible to check Bloomfield's 
field notes for "any original record of his has not been located" (Bloomfield & 
Nichols, 1991, p. 9) and the book was based solely on his edited notes.  Near the 
end of Bloomfield's career, he wrote that: 
 "Anyone who is placed in the abnormal situation of speaking his 
language to uncomprehending foreigners is likely to slow up his 
speech and to distort it.  An English-speaker, for instance, is likely 
to replace the slurred vowels of unstressed syllables by the full and 
distinct vowels which we use under stress; speakers of other 
languages will make the same or similar distortions." (Bloomfield, 
1945, p. 433) 

 
 
24 
 
He also wrote that "for the most part, both in hearing and in reproducing a foreign 
language, we are likely to replace the foreign sounds by the nearest sounds of 
our own language"(p.433).  Coates & Thornborrow (1999) echo this sentiment 
and argue that treating transcripts as the actual data or the spoken word is a 
problem especially since 'the ear is a subjective instrument at best, and one 
transcriber's hearing of a given chunk of talk will inevitably differ from another's" 
(pp. 594-595).  
 
Through this acknowledgement of how cultural differences can affect what 
is being said and what is being heard, it appears as though Bloomfield is trying to 
atone for his earlier research when he may have had an ethnocentric attitude that 
allowed him to alter the speech patterns of Angeline Williams and others in order 
to conform to an academic or cultural standard that was prevalent at the time.  
This is significant because linguists and language advocates have utilized 
Bloomfield's earlier works and any discrepancies such as the aforementioned 
need to be addressed at some point, however, this is not the nature and the 
scope of the current research project.3 Currently, it serves as a caution to treat 
these works accordingly. 
 
There are six chapters in the thesis.  The first chapter is an introduction 
and discusses the rationale, the research paradigm and the methodology of the 
research project.  The second chapter discusses historic trauma as it applies to 
Indigenous people.  This chapter seeks to provide a thorough background of the 
                                                           
3 Linguists like Bloomfield recorded a fair amount of Ojibwe and other languages like Cree and helped 
develop a linguistic analysis of these languages.  They are still useful resources but should be used with a 
caution of the limitations along with a co-analysis with current language speakers whenever possible. 

 
 
25 
"adverse conditions" as noted by a participant and experienced by many 
Indigenous people.  When including and developing this chapter, the author was 
aware that the total history of the IRS system is not known to all research 
participants.  By its inclusion in the thesis, it assists the reader in understanding 
the environment of the IRS system as a factor in historic trauma and it also 
becomes a community resource for members to access and utilize.  The third 
chapter details the continuation of historic trauma in the forms of ethnocentrism, 
racism and stereotypes.  Chapter four provides a basic understanding of the 
importance of language and identity for Indigenous people and for Nishnaabek.  
The fifth chapter provides an analysis of the research project's Nishnaabemwin 
findings and the sixth chapter is a conclusion with recommendations.  Each 
chapter presents academic background of each topic followed by the analysis of 
the relevant results from the research project. 
1.3.6 Transcription, Orthography and Classification 
 
The language samples were transcribed without the aid of transcription 
software.  They were transcribed in both the International Phonetic Alphabet 
(IPA) and the double vowel writing system where possible as it is commonly used 
by some members of Sagamok Anishnawbek, the community that will have 
copies of the thesis.  This version is in Appendix F.  The tables utilized in the 
thesis are only transcribed in their IPA format while discussion of the terms in the 
text of the thesis will appear in the double vowel writing system as well as the 
IPA.  The language samples were not 'corrected' to previous documented 
standards, rather the sampling's linguistic form was transcribed in the IPA by the 

 
 
26 
researcher who assumes all responsibility for any errors in that process.  The 
narratives are transcribed only in the double vowel writing system along with an 
English translation provided by each corresponding participant and are in 
Appendix G. 
 
Throughout the work, the terms Aboriginal, Indigenous and First Nations 
are used interchangeably depending on the context.  Likewise, the terms 
Anishinaabek/ Nishnaabek and Nishnaabemwin/ Anishinaabemowin/Ojibwe 
language are used in the same manner.

CHAPTER TWO: Historical Trauma 
2.1 Historical Relations 
 
As the IRS system took hold of Aboriginal communities, it reflected the 
ongoing relations between the Canadian government and Aboriginal peoples.  To 
better understand how this system that existed for approximately one hundred 
and fifty years was implemented and maintained, it is necessary to understand 
the history of relations between incoming Europeans and the Nations that lived in 
the Americas, particularly in what is now Canada. 
 
The IRS system was not a system that was created overnight.  The first 
attempts to educate Indigenous children were as early as the first settlements as 
was the case in 1635 in New France when the practice of leaving Indigenous 
children in the care of the missionaries to improve Huron and French relations 
was encouraged (Brasfield, 2001, p. 78; Miller, 1996, p. 42).  Notably this 
occurred when Europeans were first arriving to the 'new world' and in need of 
food, shelter as well as military and trade alliances, a time when harmonious 
relations between themselves and the Huron as well as other First Nations were 
desired.  At the same time, disease foreign to First Nations was being introduced 
to them and it quickly decimated their populations causing the beginning of a 
cultural shift.  This cultural shift involved the introduction of the 'dualist' European 
cultural view and hierarchal social order as well as its capitalist economic system.  
It was made easier by the rapid spread of European diseases such as small pox 
and influenza and the resulting famine and death amongst Indigenous people 
that saw the loss of those most susceptible to disease, Elders, traditional 

 
 
28 
knowledge keepers, and medicine people, people who would have eased 
Indigenous people's transition into a new world shared with Europeans.  During 
this time of great uncertainty, many Indigenous people, not having their 
traditional cultural resources available to them, turned to the 'assistance' of 
Christianity for an explanation and a solution to the increasingly traumatic events 
unfolding in their lives (Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004). 
 
The competition amongst the European powers, primarily the English and 
the French, for dominance of North America's resources saw First Nations 
becoming involved in that competition as trading partners and political allies.  A 
key component of this early relationship was the forging of peace treaties and the 
building of the fur trading empire.  A December 13, 1665 peace treaty concluded 
at Quebec documents the nature of the relations between the French and the 
Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga and Onondaga Nations.  The provisions of the treaty 
"portray Indigenous nations as autonomous, self-governing nations in possession 
of their territories, within an asserted framework of French suzerainty and 
protection" (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples [RCAP], 1993, p. 12).  
Although both Indigenous peoples and Europeans saw their relationship through 
their own' bias', it is safe to conclude that their relations were "remarkably 
complex and fluid and harboured a great deal more ambiguity than either side 
was ordinarily inclined to admit" (RCAP, 1993, p. 12).   
 
 As the power struggle between the French and the English settled and 
relative peace ensued, European settlement of the North American continent was 
increasingly encouraged.  Settlement occurred quite rapidly and a westward 

 
 
29 
expansion began.  In order for this westward expansion to continue unhindered, 
harmonious relations were still required from Indigenous peoples despite the 
earlier direct conflict over lands.  In fact, 'a policy developed whereby lands 
required for settlement would be secured from Aboriginal owners by formal 
agreement" (RCAP, 1993, p. 13).  Thereby arose the treaties for land cessions, a 
key component of British and Aboriginal relations.  As well, the Royal 
Proclamation of 1763 demonstrated the continued recognition of the sovereignty 
that Aboriginal peoples possess.  
 
Although the period after the War of 1812 is usually recognized as the 
beginning of the end of Aboriginal military power, other shifts were occurring in 
Aboriginal and European relations, in particular, a shift within the home front of 
early Canadian life.  This shift is best illustrated by the case of Suzanne Connelly, 
the Cree wife of a North West Company fur trader, William Connelly, who left 
Suzanne for Julia Woolrich after thirty some years of marriage.  The court did 
recognize the legal validity of Suzanne's Cree marriage to William Connelly in 
1867 but what is interesting about the case is that it mirrors the declining 
influence of or need for Aboriginal people in the growing presence of Canadian 
society, not just as political allies and economic partners but within the home 
itself and the surrounding community.  William Connelly climbed the fur trading 
empire ladder with the help of his marriage to Suzanne but after making his 
fortune, he abandoned her for the 'civilized society' of Montreal.  Had he done so 
earlier in his marriage and career, his abandonment of Suzanne would have 
ended his alliance with her people as well as his career.  However, "at a certain 

 
 
30 
stage, newcomers have sometimes found it convenient to forget their early 
alliances and pacts with Indigenous peoples and to construct communities that 
excluded them and suppressed any local roots" (RCAP, 1993, pp. 7-8). 
 
This betrayal, a microcosm of larger Canadian and Aboriginal relations, 
became chronic as the reciprocity diminished between the two nations and is yet 
another debilitating factor in the historic trauma faced by Aboriginal peoples.  
Aboriginal peoples came to be increasingly seen as not having any economic, 
military and political resources and strength in the emerging Euro-Canadian 
society and as a consequence became increasingly marginalized.  Infringements 
became violations of First Nations rights and freedoms and yet they were justified 
under a cloak of paternalism and assimilation.  Violations included legislating "for 
Indians" under s. 91(24) of the British North America Act of 1867 as seen in the 
various Indian Acts and other legislation related to Indians enacted soon after 
Confederation.  These Indian Acts became legal venues for the illegal violations 
forced upon a marginalized and traumatized people such as An Act for the 
gradual enfranchisement of Indians in 1869 that gave the Superintendent-
General of Indian Affairs the final say as to who could be elected chief by the 
communities or the Indian Act of 1876 which prohibited Aboriginal people on the 
Prairies from selling their wheat crop (Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
[TRC], 2012b).  Both pieces of legislation would serve to politically and  
economically stifle First Nations.  Subsequent amendments to the Indian Act 
such as the one in 1895 that provided for the outlawing of "traditional dances and 
customs" like the Sun Dance ceremonies or Rain Dances or the amendment in 

 
 
31 
1927 that made it illegal for hire counsel to assist with legal claims unless the 
prior approval of the Indian agent was received, created more restrictions on First 
Nations political, social, and economic well-being (RCAP, 1996a).  It is also 
important to note that just prior to Canada's birth, legislation was already enacted 
that whittled away at First Nations sovereignty such as The Gradual Civilization 
Act of 1857 which saw the external regulation of band membership and 
adoptions.  This Act and others would serve as a basis for future legislation once 
Canada became a country in 1867. 
 
The effect of the various Indian Acts was to further entrench historic 
trauma for Aboriginal people as more of their rights and freedoms were violated 
causing additional cultural upheaval.  The paternalism and assimilation policies of 
the Canadian government that executed the Indian Acts also were used to 
implement a behemoth of a system that would traumatize and radically transform 
Aboriginal communities, the IRS system, and in 1920, another Indian Act 
amendment was made "to allow it to enfranchise people without their consent, 
and to require school-aged Indian children to attend school" (TRC, 2012b, p. 12).  
 
The paternalism and assimilation policies were shaped in part by Social 
Darwinism, "a pseudo-scientific belief that some peoples, including Aboriginal 
peoples, were inherently defective in biological, intellectual, and emotional 
composition" (Stonechild, 2006, p. 7).  It was the dominant ideology in the 
Canadian Confederation era and even arguably in existence today as the 
Stephen Harper government imposes Bill C-45 that will amend the Indian Act to 
include the privatization of Aboriginal lands, as opposed to the traditional 

 
 
32 
communal responsibility for land, in the ethnocentric and assimilationist belief 
that this measure will increase Aboriginal prosperity as it did for Euro-Canadians 
(and yet unheeding of the historic social disarray resulting from people's 
dispossession from communal lands, particularly in Britain).  The underlying 
belief of Social Darwinism was that "Aboriginal culture would not be able to cope 
with social and cultural challenges posed by the arrival of Europeans.  These 
ideas strongly influenced government policy making, with the thrust being that the 
best chance for Indians was assimilation into the lower levels of mainstream 
society" (Stonechild, 2006, p. 7).   
2.2 Implementation of the Indian Residential School System 
 
In 1830, the British Imperial policy toward Aboriginal peoples took a drastic 
turn away from the protection of Aboriginal people's autonomy via the Royal 
Proclamation of 1763 that was largely due to the conflict arising between the 
increasing number of Euro-Canadian settlers and the First Nations of Upper and 
Lower Canada.  A policy of civilization was deemed to be more beneficial in 
dealing with Aboriginal people.  This policy was not very effective as noted by the 
Bagot Commission in 1844 in its official Report whereby the policy advocated for 
was one of assimilation with a recommendation for 'manual labour ' or Industrial 
schools (Milloy, 1999, p. 13).  Initially, some Aboriginal people welcomed the 
creation of schools as it would assist them in living with the Euro-Canadians 
(Schmalz, 1991; Miller, 1996; TRC, 2012b). 
 
Although schools were created earlier, in the 1820's Methodists had 
created day schools in Upper Canada and in the 1840s the Roman Catholics 

 
 
33 
began a day school on Wikwemikong, officially supported schools were created 
between 1848 and 1851, Alnwick School in Alderville and Mount Elgin School in 
Muncey Town (Milloy, 1999, p. 17).  Due to high absenteeism as Aboriginal 
people continued with their semi-nomadic lifestyles or disapproved of the 
residential schools' policies and practices, it quickly became apparent to the 
government that what was needed was to focus on the youth and on a particular 
style of education, the residential school.  In fact, a vision of 'education in the 
service of assimilation' was created and expanded upon so that it became 
generally accepted that "to educate Aboriginal children effectively they had to be 
separated from their families - that the parenting process in Aboriginal 
communities had to be disrupted" (Milloy, 1999, p. 23).  Underpinning this vision 
was the strong belief in the racial superiority of the white race and the relative 
inferiority of the red race that the white race would and could alleviate (Milloy, 
1999; Miller 1996; RCAP 1996b; TRC 2012b).   
 
By the end of the 1940's, the IRS system assumed a 'child caring' role 
based on governmental special committee recommendations and in 1969 new 
criteria was added to the official school policies that set out that Native children 
could be apprehended and placed in the IRS in cases of neglect (Milloy, 1999, 
pp.211-212).  Neglect which was defined by a provincial, non-Indigenous 
standard, included "alcoholism in the home, lack of supervision, [and] serious 
immaturity" (Milloy, 1999, p.211).  By the time of the adoption of this new 'role', 
Aboriginal people had been suffering from historic trauma for centuries and it had 
manifested itself in 'economic and social disintegration' for some families.  Often 

 
 
34 
the social net of traditional Indigenous communities was not in place to protect 
these families and "while some former students were critical of the residential 
schools, some simply stated: "Where else could we go?" (Schmalz, 1991, p. 
188).  There were also children who were still sent to the residential schools in 
the hopes of learning more of the 'white man's' ways in order to simply get an 
education (Schmalz, 1991;TRC, 2012a; TRC, 2012b) or to overcome oppressive 
measures against First Nations.  The latter was the case for Shirley Williams who 
was instructed by her father to "learn about the Indian Act and come home to 
teach us about it" (Aboriginal Healing Foundation [AHF], 2006a, p. 4). 
 
The legal ground work of the various Indian Acts allowed for the 
apprehension of Aboriginal children from their homes in order to fulfill Canadian 
society's desire for the assimilation of Aboriginal peoples.  It should be noted that 
several reports, most notably the 1907 Bryce Report, that called for substantial 
changes to the existing IRS system, staff complaints about the conditions facing 
Aboriginal students as well as parents' and community leaders' efforts to have 
their children removed from the residential schools, were all but ignored by the 
Churches and the Canadian government (Christensen, Irving, Meeches & 
Wolochatiuk, 2012; Miller, 1996; Milloy, 1999; Schmalz, 1991).  This disregard 
and denial aggravated the conditions that arose within this IRS system and 
constituted yet more events in the historic trauma that Aboriginal people would 
endure. 
 
 

 
 
35 
2.3 The Indian Residential School System: Conditions and Effects 
 
The assimilationist position that Aboriginal children needed to be removed 
from their parental influences was taken to the extreme of discouraging visits or 
making it very difficult for them to visit their children by placing the schools a fair 
distance away from the children's home communities.  Often the children would 
not be allowed to leave the school, being forced to stay during the summer and 
winter holidays.  The general state of the residential schools was lacking in 
structural integrity, hygiene and safety due to the fact that "the school system 
grew almost without planning or restraint and was, as a whole, constantly 
underfunded" (Milloy, 1999, p. 52).  There are specific examples of schools 
however, that defied any logic in allowing them to remain open to house children 
such as the Calgary Industrial School that was inconveniently placed too close to 
the Bow river and when the waters rose, the school and its sewer system 
flooded.  Often, the schools would be built on land that was inadequate for 
farming, grazing, or woodlands, the necessities for maintenance of most of the 
schools (Milloy, 1999, p. 81).  The threat of fire was very real in many schools 
and, in such an event, the common practice of some staff to lock the doors to 
keep students from running away or 'visiting' thereby blocked escape routes for 
students (Milloy, 1999).  
 
 Due to the often inadequate building structures, heating, ventilation and 
sewer systems, overcrowding and unhygienic practices, disease and death 
became rampant in the schools.  Tuberculosis, in particular, became the scourge 
of the school system.  The death rate that resulted from it was staggeringly 

 
 
36 
epidemic (Milloy, 1999, pp. 84, 91).  The Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-
1919 also had catastrophic effects on Aboriginal students and communities 
(Milloy, 1999, TRC, 2012b).  A much darker epidemic would be the suicides of 
youth who were unable to cope with the trauma of the IRS system. 
 
The food provided within the often unsanitary conditions of the schools 
was not sufficient for the nutritional needs of the students (First Nations Centre, 
2005b; Miller, 1996; Milloy, 1999; RCAP, 1996b; TRC, 2012b).  As mentioned 
earlier, many schools were not situated on land that was favourable for crops or 
grazing animals and therefore, any attempts to supplement the diet through 
growing and raising their own food supply never succeeded.  Ironically, in the 
schools where farming was able to be successful, the crops and produce were 
often sold by the school or consumed by the staff (Milloy, 1999; Miller, 1996; 
TRC, 2012b).  Revelations of medical experimentation at some schools such as  
St. Mary's Indian Residential School and Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential 
School, both in Ontario, that included the withholding of food and/or vitamin 
supplements are more cruel examples of the lack of nutrition that Indigenous 
children endured (CBC News, 2000; Hastings, 2013; Mosby, 2013; Porter, 2013; 
Ulrichsen, 2013).  Children were also inadequately clothed in school uniforms 
provided by the schools primarily due to lack of funding. 
 
The staff who worked in the residential schools were often untrained and 
unqualified for the performance of their duties and nor did the Canadian 
government or the various churches involved with the residential schools provide 
any guarantee that the staff had to be 'appropriate'.  The schools were avoided 

 
 
37 
by properly trained staff mostly because the schools could not afford to attract 
and maintain them.  More often than not, the less desirable and 'less competent' 
staff ended up in the schools and due to the conditions within the schools 
coupled with a lack of adequate training, staff were not able to effectively cope 
with the situation.  A work culture developed and spread within the IRS system, a 
work culture where "neglect became a thoughtless habit, harsh discipline and 
excessive cruelty unexceptional events that were routinely excused or 
ignored"(Milloy, 1999, p. 111). 
 
It was this particular type of staff who implemented a regime of physical 
discipline that often crossed the line to physical abuse.  Corporal punishment was 
the normal standard of the day and spanking by parents and strapping by 
teachers were commonplace in homes and schools (First Nations Centre, 
2005b;TRC, 2012b).  Undoubtedly, this was a reflection of the Christian teaching, 
'spare the rod, spoil the child'.  It was also this unchecked, unmonitored staff who 
primarily perpetrated abuses-physical, sexual and emotional upon the children in 
the schools. 
 
The 'academic' regime that the staff implemented was not focused on 
higher learning for the IRS system's goal was assimilation of Aboriginals into 
Euro-Canadian society where their rightful place was seen to be lower than Euro-
Canadians.  It was standard in the IRS system that class instruction was for half 
a day and chores and other forms of labour occupied the other half.  Racism 
permeated the staff's views of the Aboriginal students, a by-product of their time, 

 
 
38 
and this created a sense amongst the staff that Aboriginal children were 'different' 
and unable to be taught (Milloy, 1999, p. 179). 
 
Upon entrance to the residential schools, children were stripped of their 
personal clothing and mementos of cultural and personal significance such as 
amulets, medicine pouches, or clothing sewn by a loved one, shaved or shorn,  
deloused, provided with a standard uniform and often a number for identification, 
and removed from family members of the opposite sex (Christensen, Irving, 
Meeches & Wolochatiuk, 2012; Miller, 1996; Milloy, 1999; RCAP 1996b; TRC, 
2012a; TRC 2012b).  It was the immediate purging of any personal identification 
with another self, another life.  It was dehumanizing, traumatic and yet another 
incident that is part of the historic trauma suffered by Aboriginal people.  Added 
to this depersonalization was the suffering inflicted upon children who spoke an 
Indigenous language as fists, straps, and public humiliation were commonly used 
as deterrents for those who spoke in their mother tongue.  In some schools, an 
informal system of student informants assisted in keeping the use of Indigenous 
languages to a bare minimum (Levine & Cooper, 1976, pp. 56, 64). 
 
Although there were initial attempts to teach in Indigenous languages 
(Miller, 1996 TRC, 2012b) such as that of the "Oblates and Anglican Church 
Missionary Society teachers who were instructed by their superiors to learn the 
languages of their charges," (Miller, 1996, p. 199) this practice was eventually 
prohibited.  While at one time the use of Indigenous languages by missionaries 
and other religious lay-men could ease conversion to non-traditional Aboriginal 
religions, shame parents about their traditional lifestyle and also entice parents to 

 
 
39 
send children to the residential schools, it eventually did not fit in with the 
assimilation policy of the IRS system: 
"That the Department and churches understood consciously that 
culture or, more particularly, that the task of overturning one 
ontology in favour of another was the challenge they faced is seen 
in their identification of language as the critical issue in the circle.  It 
was through language that the child gained its ontological 
inheritance from its parents and community.  The word bore the 
burden of the culture from generation to the next. It was the vital 
connection." (Milloy, 1999, p. 38)  
 
The conditions of the IRS system detailed above: the inadequate housing 
often remote from Aboriginal communities; the extremely high prevalence of 
disease and death; the limited and non-nutritional food supply; the lack of 
properly trained and monitored staff who quickly developed a work culture that 
tolerated abuses; the use of harsh and punitive discipline that often escalated to 
abuse; physical and sexual abuse; the daily regime and educational curriculum 
that focused not on learning but on assimilation and manual labour; the 
depersonalization of children with the removal of personal and cultural items of 
significance; and the attempts to extinguish Indigenous languages all contributed 
to the historic trauma of Indigenous people.  These conditions are referred to as 
"a particularly distressing part of the history of human rights violations" against 
Indigenous peoples and "the residential school period continues to cast a long 
shadow of despair on indigenous communities, and many of the dire social and 

 
 
40 
economic problems faced by aboriginal peoples are linked to that experience" 
(Anaya, 2014, p. 5). 
 
 How far do the impacts of the IRS system extend?  It is estimated that 
over 150,000 Indigenous children attended residential Schools (TRC, 2012b).  A 
self-admitted conservative estimate by the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (2006b, 
p. 193) places the number of personally and inter-generationally impacted at 
three hundred and seventy-three thousand, three hundred and fifty (373, 350).  
Another study has documented that 65% of urban Aboriginal Indigenous people 
state that they personally attended either a federal Indian Residential or 
provincial day school (12%) or that a family member has attended such 
institutions (Environics Institute, 2010, p. 55).  Further, of this 65%, either 50% 
say it had a significant impact while 23% say it had some impact in shaping their 
lives and who they are today (p. 55).   
 
More specifically, in an earlier study of Aboriginal inmates in the Federal 
Penitentiary system, 20% stated that they attended a residential school and the 
average rating was 1.78 out of five with five being very positive and 1 being very 
negative (Trevethan, Auger, Moore, MacDonald & Sinclair, 2001, p. 36).  More 
recent studies such as the Office of the Correctional Investigator's 2013-2014  
Annual Report (2014) noted that 73% of federal Aboriginal inmates reported a 
familial history of involvement with the residential school system while 18% said 
they themselves were residential school survivors (p. 43). 
  
How have the survivors been effected by the conditions they endured 
while in the IRS system?  TRC (2012a) declares "generations of children were 

 
 
41 
traumatized by the experience" (p. 1) of the IRS system and that the IRS system 
"constituted an assault on Aboriginal children, Aboriginal families, Aboriginal 
culture [and] self-governing and self-sustaining Aboriginal nations" (p. 25).  
Assault is trauma and trauma is an atrocity, "an event whose very intensity 
makes it impossible to take in through our cognitive structures" (Wesley-
Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004, p. 52). 
 
The specific range of effects that trauma can have are: cognitive, 
emotional, physical, and behavioural: 
 "Cognitive responses include memory difficulties, lack of 
concentration, poor judgement, inability to discriminate, and inability 
to make choices.  Emotional responses include depression, 
withdrawal, excitability, flashbacks, intense fear, feelings of 
helplessness, loss of control, loss of connection and meaning, 
generalized anxiety, and specific fears. Physical responses include 
stomach pains, tightness of the chest, headaches, perspiration, and 
psychosomatic complaints.  Behavioural responses include 
irritability, startling easily, hyper-alertness, insomnia, 
communication difficulties, and drug, cigarette, or alcohol abuse." 
(Brahm, 2004, p. 2) 
 
Most Aboriginal children would have undergone some if not all of the above 
mentioned symptoms and until their trauma is resolved, they would have 
continued to manifest these symptoms in their homes and in their communities. 

 
 
42 
 
Aside from the effects of trauma for those who experienced abuse in any 
form and for those who witnessed the abuse, other effects occurred and it should 
always be kept in mind that the conditions of the IRS system amplified these 
effects just as the historic trauma of the relations between Aboriginal people and 
Euro-Canadians were 'replayed' each time a new traumatic event occurred with 
the result that the trauma built upon itself, burdening the individual and the 
culture.  Unaddressed, the historic trauma perpetuated a dysfunctional 
environment in many Indigenous communities.   
 
An emotional impact was the most common for survivors who experienced 
excruciating loneliness when they were first separated from their primary 
caregivers, who were usually their parents and/or grandparents (Bezeau & 
Hoskins, 2007; First Nations Centre, 2005b; Miller, 1996; TRC, 2012a; TRC, 
2012b).  For those who attended residential schools with siblings, most were not 
allowed to see their own siblings or the opposite sex.  This created more 
loneliness and a deeper emotional impact.  Loving embraces and kind words 
were also not to be had from the majority of staff in the IRS system as was the 
case for the late Dr. Mary Thomas and Phil Fontaine (Bezeau & Hoskins, 2007).  
When children so obviously would have needed this in order to emotionally 
survive the cruel and isolated conditions within the schools, they were often 
denied this even from the people who were their surrogate caregivers. 
 
Increased learned helplessness is an impact of the IRS system. Learned 
helplessness occurs when individuals feel that their actions would not assist in 
alleviating any pressures and they cease trying to do so (Brasfield, 2001; 

 
 
43 
Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004).  Motivation decreases and the causes 
of whatever situation are internalized as opposed to being explained logically by 
the external factors that contributed to the situation.  It was noted earlier that 
attempts to address the wrongdoings and problems with the system were ignored 
or silenced.  This contributed to increased learned helplessness.   
 
The loss of parenting skills was another significant impact (First Nations 
Centre, 2005b; TRC, 2012b; Wesley-Esquimaux, 2004).  While in the IRS 
system, most children were away from the positive role modeling of healthy 
parents, a nurturing extended family and a community of care.  As Aboriginal 
children grew up within the IRS system, their role models became their 
'caregivers', the staff at the residential schools who, as established earlier, were 
primarily operating on an overt and covert racist belief in their own superiority and 
Aboriginal inferiority as well as being improperly trained to teach let alone guide 
youth in appropriate interpersonal and cultural relationship development.  Yet this 
is what often occurred.  The parenting style of IRS survivors is primarily an 
adaptation of their experiences with the staff at the schools (Redman, 2000, p. 
33, Wesley-Esquimaux, 2004, p.65).   
 
While it is simple enough to say 'loss of parenting skills,' what exactly do 
parenting skills encompass?  Parenting skills include: utilizing traditional 
Indigenous 'disciplinary' and conflict resolution methods; fostering appropriate 
emotional responses, communication styles and sense of humour; establishing 
daily family interactions, family routines and cultural customs; and perhaps most 
importantly, developing "[a] child's ontology, 'The symbolic ordering of the world' 

 
 
44 
through which 'actions and objects take on meaning [which] is inherited from its 
parents' and community from the moment of birth" (Milloy, 1999, p. 37). 
 
Without these skills being taught to children from infancy through to young 
adulthood, there was an alienation from home, family, friends and community 
upon their return but also, these same skills would not be transferred to the next 
generation and subsequently, there was a further disconnect within the culture. 
 
The learned belief in the inferiority of parents and culture is also another 
effect of the IRS.  Mary Young, a survivor of the IRS, relates that:  
 "Growing up and living at home, I never had reason to question my 
father's authority or his values and beliefs [but] after being away
 from home in the residential school, being away from the family and 
immersed in school, I found myself gravitating to these newly found 
ways of learning.  My father's teachings became trivial." (Young, 
2005, pp. 23-24)   
 
Mary adds, "Not only did I doubt myself, but I also noticed I began 
questioning my father's wisdom, teachings and our way of life.  Part of this 
skepticism was influenced by the fact that the existence of my people 
(Anishinabe and other Aboriginal people) was not part of the curriculum" (pp.23-
24).  Mary was not alone in these views.  Grant (2004) notes that Edith Dalla 
Costa, 'like many other residential school students, experienced feelings of 
superiority' and Edith recalls "I thought I was better than they were," while 
understanding that "these feelings of superiority were the product of policies 
aimed at relentless cultural genocide" (p.133).  Likewise in Schmalz (1991) Jane 

 
 
45 
Willis describes her reaction to her own community after attending an Indian 
Residential school, " I was appalled at the shabbiness and seediness that 
surrounded me...Had I become a snob-as my friends had predicted I would- 
looking down at my own people and their old ways" (pp. 187-8). 
 
The intergenerational impacts take different forms such as victim K's when  
it is shared that: 
"The rage and the anger is still there in all of us...there ain't no 
cavalry running around here!  We're doing it to ourselves.  I've 
never been in a boarding school.  I wish I was [had] because all
 of the abuse we talked about happened in my home.  If it had 
happened by strangers, it wouldn't have been so bad-the sexual 
abuse, the neglect.  Then I could blame it on another race. [Pause].  
I don't think I've ever bonded with any parental figures in my home.  
Physically, they were there.  But that's all.  And yes, they went to 
boarding school." (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998, p. 69)  
 
 
The full extent of the intergenerational effects of the IRS system are 
unknown although a few studies have examined them in relation to specific 
areas.  Lower educational outcomes are associated with parental IRS attendance 
as is "more frequent contemporary stressor experiences and relative greater 
effects of stressors on well-being" (Bougie & Senecal, 2010. p. 19, Bombay et al, 
2014, p. 326).  Specifically, there is also the intergenerational impact of 
psychological stress such as suicide which is more prevalent among adults who 
had at least one parent who attended IRS (37.2%) compared to those whose 

 
 
46 
parents did not attend at 25.7% (Bombay et al, 2014, p. 324).  Juutilainen et al 
(2014) discusses the intergenerational impacts of vulnerability such as language 
and cultural loss, fractured identity and negative self-worth.  At times, however, 
the intergenerational effect of the IRS system appears to strengthen cultural 
aspects as is illustrated in the Ohmagari & Berkes (1997) study.  While 
acknowledging that residential schools were generally not "conducive" to the 
maintenance of traditional bush skills, the greater transmission of these skills for 
the group of students who attended a residential school as compared to those 
who attended local schools was attributable to "differences in the learning 
environment of the two groups of students" (Ohmagari & Berkes, 1997, p. 213).  
Specifically, there was less emphasis on traditional bush skills for the families 
whose children went to local schools while those who attended the residential 
school were taken out on the land when they were not at school. 
 
The intergenerational impact is significant given that for the one parent 
who may have attended a residential school, he or she may have three offspring 
and thereby tripled the effect of the IRS system within Aboriginal communities.  It 
will continue to grow unless the historic trauma is addressed and healing 
strategies are developed and implemented.  This impact is also significant 
because many intergenerational survivors may not even have known that a 
parent attended the IRS system and therefore would not even have known what 
to look for in terms of answers for particular behaviours.  In such a scenario, 
unresolved grief and historic trauma would have passed again to another 
generation.

 Just as family relationships were altered through the impact of the IRS 
system, so too were interpersonal relations within the community.  Lateral 
violence while largely attributed to oppression and colonization is also, by virtue 
of the former, attributable to the IRS system (BearPaw Media Productions & 
Miller, 2006; First Nations Centre, 2005b; Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 
2004).  Lateral violence is a cycle of abuse wherein an oppressed people utilize 
negative behaviours against other members of the oppressed group.  George 
Brertton, when describing his eleven year experience in the residential school, 
states that "What I learned in there, you know, for me was to survive that system 
and to survive that it was like learning how to steal, cheat and everything, you 
know, everything so negative I learned in there" (Bear Paw Media Productions & 
Miller, 2006).  Without parental and community role models such as Elders to 
influence proper relations amongst people, lateral violence became an 
increasingly acceptable practice in many communities. 
 
Increased gender socialization was a significant IRS system impact as 
well.  When students were separated from their siblings of the opposite sex on a 
daily basis for months and then years at a time, this form of Euro-Canadian 
socialization was further entrenched.  Although genders had different roles in 
Aboriginal communities, gender socialization when it did occur did not include the 
devaluing of women's roles as it is typically did within Euro-Canadian society that 
saw fit not to allow women to vote, hold property or attend institutions of higher 
learning (Niethammer, 1977a; Niethammer, 1977b; Niethammer, 1977c; Wesley-
Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004).  The IRS system created deeper lines of 

 
 
48 
division within Aboriginal communities and undoubtedly has a role to play in the 
increasing subjugation and victimization of Aboriginal women.   
 
Another impact was the acknowledgement that the abuses endured at 
residential school was not always perpetrated by the staff.  Trevethan et al (2001)  
reported that 77% of Aboriginal federal inmates stated that they were sexually or 
physically abused at a residential school and 87% of the abuse came from staff 
(p.36).  An unspoken truth in the report's statistics was that 13% of the abuse 
came from other students.  Most often, these very students returned to their 
communities and began the cycle of abuse within their families and communities 
(Barlow, 2009; Corrado & Cohen, 2003; Schmalz, 1991; TRC, 2012b).  As a male 
survivor related, it was harder knowing that the abuser was a family member and 
no longer the staff member (Bourque, 2012).  This traumatic sentiment is echoed 
by many survivors who have courageously and publicly come forward to speak 
out against the IRS system (TRC, 2012a; TRC, 2012b).  For the many who do, 
having undergone a personal healing journey that has helped them come 
forward, there are just as many survivors who have not gone on that journey yet, 
in part due to an early death but also to never having the opportunity to do so, 
and their stories will largely be untold. 
 
The loss of traditional healing methodologies is another significant impact 
that clearly demonstrates how historic trauma is able to manifest within  
communities.  As detailed in Chapter One, disease, alcoholism, introduction of 
new worldviews and social order, warfare, economic shift, and increased 
European settlement contributed to the loss of traditional healing methods as a 

 
 
49 
means to adjust to the often drastic changes facing Indigenous peoples.  The 
introduction of the IRS system escalated this.  Children away at the residential 
school would not have had the opportunity to take part in traditional healing 
ceremonies nor learn traditional medicinal knowledge (Barlow, 2009; First 
Nations Centre, 2005b; First Nations Information Governance Centre [FNIGC], 
2012; TRC, 2012a).  They would have been subjected to the views of many staff 
who did not understand Indigenous culture and spirituality and who demeaned 
such practices.  As a result, there would have been fear of punishment for 
attending these ceremonies, less familiarity with and even loss of traditional 
healing ceremonies and medicinal knowledge as well as the possible adoption of 
ethnocentric views of such ceremonies and knowledge.  Ultimately, many 
children would be denied the opportunity to heal from the historic trauma suffered 
in part by the IRS system and as well, traditional healing methodologies' use 
would diminish.  Historic trauma would thereby inter-generationally reverberate 
amongst Indigenous people. 
 
A very significant impact of the IRS system is the rapid loss of Indigenous 
languages' knowledge and usage.  The environment created by the conditions 
within the IRS system and within the emergent Indigenous communities was not 
conducive to the maintenance of Indigenous languages.  Jensen (1990) writes  
that "Under normal circumstances, all normal human beings are capable of 
learning a language, and they learn any language to which they have sufficient 
exposure" (p. 3).  Unfortunately, normal circumstances did not apply to the 
Indigenous children who were in the IRS system.   

 
 
50 
 
Language loss via the IRS system primarily occurred in three key areas: 
loss of voice; loss of language learning skills; and loss of mother tongue 
language usage.  Loss of voice is different than loss of language.  It referred to 
the inability to even speak at all.  At times, the loss of voice occurred because of 
the direct effect of a traumatic event.  At other times the loss of voice refers to 
when "some who were not abused or beaten said they had survived by trying to 
be as inconspicuous as possible.  To stay out of trouble, they trained themselves 
to be silent and invisible" (TRC, 2012a, p. 5).  Such was the case of Bernice 
Touchie who related that she "remembers being confused and frightened, not 
knowing what language she was supposed to use.  Silence became the safest 
avenue" (Grant, 2004, p. 155). 
 
Loss of language learning skills refers to the effect the conditions of the 
IRS system had on Aboriginal students' ability to acquire adequate language 
learning skills.  Specifically, the trauma of the direct and indirect abuses, the 
neglect in terms of shelter, food and medical care, the rampant disease and 
death surrounding the children, the loss of family and personal and cultural 
identity negatively impacted many children's ability to adequately acquire 
language learning skills in any language.  As discussed earlier, trauma produces 
"cognitive responses including memory difficulties, lack of concentration, poor 
judgement, inability to discriminate, and inability to make choices," all of which 
would affect children learning a language whether in the IRS or at home during 
any school breaks.  Loss of language learning skills was also due to the 
inadequate teaching methods and curriculum by non-professional and 

 
 
51 
disengaged staff as was discussed earlier in Chapter Two.  Additionally, it has 
been identified that: 
"[t]he use of a foreign language as the medium of instruction for 
children who are still struggling with basic expression in that 
language hampers not only their academic achievement and 
cognitive growth, but also their self-perception, self-esteem, 
emotional security, and their ability to participate meaningfully in the 
educational process." (Baer, Dunbar, Skutnabb-Kangas & 
 Magga, 2008, p. 7)  
 
 
Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic 
Language Proficiency (CALP) are two key concepts in understanding language 
acquisition.  BICS refers to 'conversational fluency' and CALP refers to a 
student's ability to "understand and express, in both oral and written modes, 
concepts and ideas that are relevant to success in school" (Halbach, 2012, pp. 
608).  For first language learners it takes approximately 5 to 6 years to acquire 
BICS and then another 12 years to acquire CALP (Cummins, 2008; Halbach, 
2012).  For second language learners, it takes two years to acquire BICS and 
then another 5 to 7 years to acquire CALP(Cummins, 2008; Halbach, 2012).  In 
the case of Nishnaabemwin which is an oral language that has only recently 
begun to have a written literacy component, a CALP equivalent would be the 
development of higher oral language skills that exposure to Elders' and traditional 

 
 
52 
storytellers' dialogue as well as ritualized customs and ceremonies would have 
provided for (Cummins, 2008, p. 5).4   
 
When Indigenous children were apprehended or taken to residential 
schools, they were relatively young, approximately 6 years of age when they 
started at the schools although there are many cases where both very young and 
older children were sent to the schools.  If they spoke their mother tongue upon 
entering the residential school, they would have spoken their mother tongue with 
the degree of skill that a 6 year old or a 4 or 9 year old would have had.  At this 
point, there may have been total or near total completion of BICS depending on 
the age and language learning abilities of each child.  Children were then placed 
in an environment where there were usually no fluent adult Indigenous language 
speakers who could help develop their language skills.  When these children 
eventually left the IRS system, their mother tongue proficiency would have been 
largely underdeveloped at the CALP level.  If attendance at the residential school 
was minimal, 1 to 2 years, this break in language learning may not have as big 
an impact, however, one still needs to consider that the environment that these 
children were in, however brief, was still one that was negative and not conducive 
to maintaining their mother tongue fluency.  Thus those students, with each year 
accumulated, would have a bigger gap in language learning to overcome if they 
chose to keep speaking and learning their mother tongue when they left the IRS 
system. 
                                                           
4The researcher's personal maternal and paternal family history of the role of Elders and storytellers 
indicates that during this storytelling time, children were silent, listening to the orator share a variety of 
stories including tribal history, family history and 'funny stories.'  This oral history transmission would be 
at a higher level whereby respected, well-versed and older individuals shared their language proficiency. 

 
 
53 
 
Lastly, the loss of mother tongue language usage occurred due to the 
physical, mental and emotional stigmatization and trauma Aboriginal children 
faced when they spoke their mother tongue (Bezeau & Hoskins, 2007; Bourque, 
2012; Christensen, Irving, Meeches & Wolochatiuk, 2012; First Nations Centre, 
2005b; First Nations Indigenous Governance Centre, 2012; RCAP, 1996 ; 
Juutilainen et al, 2014; Task Force on Aboriginal Language and Culture, 2005; 
TRC, 2012a; TRC, 2012b; Wesley-Esquimaux, 2004).  Faced with often extreme 
punishment for speaking their language as it clearly defied the ethnocentric 
policy of the IRS system, many Aboriginal children chose to stop speaking their 
language.  What was foremost on their mind was "personal survival because it 
would easily have become a more important concern than cultural transmission 
of mores and cosmological beliefs" (Wesley-Esquimaux & Smolewski, 2004, p. 
23).  Elder Robert Smoker speaks of his suffering in the IRS system as he 
remembers the ruler that cracked his knuckles, his punishment for speaking 
Nishnaabemwin (First Language Speaking Project, 2010).  His words echo that 
of many IRS survivors like Simeonie Kunnuk in Where Are the Children: Healing 
the Legacy of Residential Schools (Aboriginal Healing Foundation and Legacy of 
Hope Foundation, 2004) who states "They stuffed their words into our mouths 
and forced us to learn and speak English" as well as Glen Anaquod and Lyna 
Hart in We Were Children (Christensen et al, 2012) who both describe the 
physical punishment they suffered for speaking their mother tongue. 
 
It is important to also consider those who did not lose their language 
through the IRS system.  First Nations Centre (2005a) found that there was an 

 
 
54 
"unexpected association between residential school attendance and language" 
and that "those who attended residential school were actually more likely to 
understand a First Nations language “relatively well” or “fluently” compared with 
those who did not attend" (74.8% vs. 43.6%) (p. 34).  This association held within 
each age group (18–34, 35–54 and 55+ years old)"(p. 34).  Two of the reasons 
provided for this unexpected outcome were that attendees spoke their mother 
tongue secretly in "active defiance " or that they relearned their language later in 
life. 
 
The aforementioned study also noted that those individuals with 
grandparents who attended residential school are less likely to speak a First 
Nations language suggesting that there is an intergenerational gap in language 
transmission (p.38).  Many survivors of the IRS system who kept their mother 
tongue fluency chose not to teach this to their own children because they did not 
want their children to suffer the physical pain and humiliation as they had 
(Bourque, 2012; TRC, 2012a).  As a result, there is also the loss of language for 
intergenerational survivors who, depending on their parent(s)' personal 
circumstances, may have a whole range of language loss emotional issues to 
resolve.  Emotional issues such as: anger that something has been cruelly stolen 
from you; denial that anything is lost and your family is the last sanctuary of 
language thereby creating an isolating sanctimonious attitude within the 
community; resentment that parents did not pass the language on; shame that 
parents were not strong enough to keep their language; lack of self-esteem and 
feeling unworthy of being traditional and learning an Indigenous language; and a 

 
 
55 
general sense of ennui that there is no place in this modern world for our 
languages.5 
 
The separation of children from their homes and communities via the IRS 
system and the prevention of children from "speaking their own languages and 
learning about their heritage and cultures" was noted in the federal government's 
1998 apology (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada [AANDC], 
2010a).  It was noted again in the Canadian 2008 apology that the IRS system 
policy "has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage 
and language"(AANDC, 2010b).  These apologies reflect the Royal Commission 
on Aboriginal Peoples (1996d) finding that: 
"[w]ith Aboriginal languages, however, an underlying reason for the 
decline is the rupture in language transmission from older to 
younger generations and the low regard many Aboriginal people 
have had for traditional language proficiency as a result of policies 
devised by government and enforced by churches and the 
education system." (p. 23) 
 
2.4 Research Analysis 
 
Overall, the qualitative findings in Parts II,III and IV from the research 
project reiterate what other scholars and researchers have documented 
regarding the IRS system - that there is variance in the kind of experience that 
individuals had which is acknowledged by the participants and also that the IRS 
system is responsible for the loss of language.  An examination of Group Two 
                                                           
5 As a co-ordinator for a language revitalization program, I have personally seen these issues come to play.  
As a Nishnaabemwin relearner, I have also had to deal with some of these issues. 

 
 
56 
comprised of sub-groups A, B and C (attendees in IRS system) results will be 
followed by that of Group One (non-attendance in IRS system). 
2.4.1 Sub-Group C – Qualitative Results on IRS System 
 
Ratings of their personal experiences on a scale of 0 to 5 with a 5 being 
very positive and a 0 being very negative revealed that the median score of all 
residential school attendees is a 4 while the median score of all day school 
attendees who reported for the question is 2.5. Sub-group C (attendance at both 
IRS and DS) gave the highest rating for their experience in the IRS system and 
while one participant did not provide a numerical rating for her experience in the 
day school, she stated that it was "basically good."  She attended day school 
after she attended residential school.  The other participant in Sub-group C did 
not give a positive rating for his experience in the day school.  He attended day 
school before residential school. 
 
As illustrated in Figure 2.4.1, a comparison of all those who attended an 
IRS, Sub-group C and Sub-group B (attendance only at IRS) indicates that the 
participant who only attended the IRS gave the lowest score, a 2 out of a 
possible 5.  The research also indicates that a longer period of time spent at an 
IRS correlated with a more negative rating.  As illustrated in Figure 2.4.2, a 
comparison of all those who attended a day school, Sub-group C and Sub-group

A (attendance only at DS) indicates both groups gave similar ratings with the 
ratings being either a 3 and 2 for each Sub-group.  It was also shown that the 
length of time spent at a day school did not affect the ratings that were low ( 2 for 
less than a year and 2 for eight years). 
 
Themes of common necessity, economic gain, basic cultural survival and 
overall loss of language for IRS system attendees emerged from the participants 
who provided the highest ratings for their experience in the IRS system.  One 
participant shared that she "got in because I wanted to be with my sisters and 
brothers already in.  They spoke English, I didn't understand and I wanted to 
understand English.  It was too far for me to walk to day school anyway."  The 
other participant shared that he "went to school because my dad wanted us to 
learn to read and write so we knew what the white man was saying so we could 
deal with it.  When there are holidays, I will come and get you he told us.  He kept 
his word...I took it that I'm not going to be there very long."  He adds that "back 
then, there was no Indian that could speak English or very few.  Back then you 
were the blunt force to get into that system, learn English."  There was also a 
sense that this participant appreciated the assistance with learning for as he 
states, later after he left Grade 8, he was "self-taught [and] had to do a lot of 
reading."   
 
Despite these high ratings provided for their personal IRS system 
experiences, there was an acknowledgement that the IRS system was not a 
good experience for everyone.  One participant stated that "my sister is opposite 
to me.  She didn't like it."  Although this same participant states that "it [IRS] 

 
 
59 
would still be good today", he qualifies it by adding "if there were Native teachers 
to speak to you because you were forced to speak, learn another language.  The  
same as the day school.  It would be smoother and you would have a better 
chance of learning.  They could explain why you are there."  The other participant 
stated that: 
"As an older person now, I'm really glad I didn't lose my language.  
Today what I see when I think of how our language was first lost 
was by the Indian Residential School because we were prompted to 
use English so that the staff could understand, we could understand 
each other.  I don't think they learned our language.  They helped 
us learn English so that we could get out and get a job.  Many lost 
their language because of that." [emphasis mine] 
 
Both of the participants in Sub-group C provided feedback about their 
experiences in day school.  One participant stated that she used it to further her 
education because "when you finished Grade 8 you had no place to go, no place 
to further your education.  I don't know who would have helped me.  My mom and 
dad did not speak English or read and write.  If I was in the Indian Residential 
school, I would have had help to further my education to go beyond Grade 8."  
Although the other participant states that he did not remember, he still gave a 
very low rating and adds that "if there was a Native teacher, it would have been 
different.  She could have talked to me."  With this statement there is a sense 
that there was a lack of understanding of his mother tongue and that the lack of 
accommodation of this language difference was a negative enough experience 

 
 
60 
that it warranted a very low rating by the participant despite him not having clear 
memories or memories that he was comfortable in sharing of his experience. 
2.4.2 Sub-group B - Qualitative Results on IRS System 
 
Themes of isolation, abuse and loss of language emerged from Sub-group 
B's sole participant's extensive commentary on her experience at the IRS: 
"I'm just glad future generations did not have to go through what we 
had to go through.  I saw abuse there, physical and mental.  I never 
liked it.  To me it felt like you didn't have freedom, to move around 
or speak your own language.  It felt like jail or being in the army.  To 
me, in all the times I was there, I never saw a cleaning person, a 
staff who cleaned.  Just the garbage man was there, he washed the 
bathrooms.  All manual work was done by children.  We were on 
hands and knees to scrub the floor.  We had to do all the kitchen 
work, prep work, cleaning except the cooking.  The girls had to 
clean the dorms, the dining room.  All the kids were assigned to 
duties like the kitchen, staff rooms, laundry, bathrooms.  We 
rotated.  We had a big playroom but no toys. No tables, chairs, had 
to sit on the floor.  Bare walls." 
 
There is quite a sense of desolation and barrenness conveyed in the 
above quote.  In addition to this, she also described how "they[siblings] were 
never home, we didn't grow up with them cuz they were at school" and that she 
was not allowed to attend her mother's funeral.  The forceful attempts to make 
her stop speaking her mother tongue are clearly remembered by her: 

 
 
61 
 "I'm glad I can still speak the language after all the abuse  I went 
through.  They put bars of soap in my mouth when  I spoke Ojibwe 
(if caught).  It happened frequently because I didn't know English.  
You learned to be sneaky to speak your language and to hide it.  
You'd be gagging from the bar of soap.  You were silent most of the 
time because you didn't speak English and you couldn't, weren't 
allowed to speak Ojibwe.  It was so silent there, maybe a lot of 
others were like me." 
 
This participant did not have anything positive to say about her experience 
in the IRS system.  Its impact was very significant on her life as she shared that 
later she ended up seeing a doctor who told her that she "was psychologically 
abused" and that she "drank because of this."  Her physician also encouraged 
her to return to her traditional ways as a means to resolve the abuse.  
2.4.3 Sub-Group A - Qualitative Results on IRS System 
 
The participants who only attended day school provided varied responses 
about their experiences.  Several strong themes emerged about the IRS system: 
loss of language; severe punishment; lack of proper instruction; 'adverse 
conditions' and yet there was some consideration for its benefits such as a 
standard education.  
 
The physical punishment that some of the day school participants suffered 
was severe.  One participant shared that: 
 "When we were in school, we couldn't speak our language, Ojibwe.  
If we spoke our language and the teacher caught us, she gave us a 
strap....one time it got so bad, I didn't go to school or home so my 

 
 
62 
mom didn't know I didn't go. If you did your school all week and you 
did something wrong, she [the teacher] didn't correct it.  She would 
only come and rub her knuckles on your ears or she would hit your 
hands with her ruler.  You had to find it out for yourself.  So that was 
at the beginning.  It was so horrible.  We still got strapped in Grade 
4 and up."  
 
Another participant also talked about the physical punishment and the 
emotional abuse: 
"I was ok with day school.  When I started I cried, I wanted to go 
home.  It was ok after because I could go home after school.  If we 
spoke our language and got caught, I remember having to write 
lines on the blackboard and on paper.  Or you got strapped or stood 
in a corner.  Also kneeling in a corner.  I thought "did this only 
happen to me?"  I got whacked with a ruler that had a piece of 
metal on it.  I once got caught chewing a piece of gum.  She made 
me put the gum on my nose and stand at the front of the room.  I 
was crying too." 
 
The third participant gave an account of a system that was both beneficial 
and yet 'adverse' as were the conditions in his home: 
"Other than the school room, facilities were adverse.  Some of my 
time was spent in the school basement.  I had to walk to school 
regardless of the weather.  When I came home, I had to do chores, 
getting water, cutting wood, no plumbing, no electricity.  The living 

 
 
63 
conditions were adverse.  Every Sunday I ran into the bush so that I 
would not go to church...School was taught by qualified non-Native 
teachers, all English oriented.  Very little or nothing at all was taught 
about our Native culture and traditions.  It gave me a qualified base 
for later educational pursuits." 
 
All of the day school participants also spoke out about the residential 
schools.  One participant stated that "I don't like the Indian Residential School 
because you couldn't speak your language, had to stay there, not see your 
parents.  If you were lucky, you went home at Christmas or summer.  You didn't 
always get to do this."  A second participant stated that at the residential school, 
her brother only went to school one month out of a year and that "for some 
reason one of the priests didn't like him and would hit him with a fist."  This same 
participant also shared that: 
"I used to talk to my mom about the Indian residential school.  They 
would punish her if they did something bad.  They worked out in the 
gardens most of the time.  That's what they used those kids for.  
Maybe some got strapped.  She got strapped but she had it coming.  
The food looked like leftovers.  The nuns and teachers all had good 
food.  I don't  know what we were eating she said." 
 
 
The third participant, while acknowledging that there were "good and bad 
schools," states that: 
 "what I have heard about Spanish has been all positive, having a 
place to live, getting an education.  If they came home, they would 

 
 
64 
have had no plumbing, no hydro, dirt roads, firewood transported by 
horse/sleigh, had to walk to go shopping, crossing the river by 
barge, poor housing.  Some people who went to Indian Residential 
School kind of enjoyed it because it was better although some did 
come home." 
2.4.4 Group One - Qualitative Results On IRS System 
 
The research project participants who did not attend the IRS system also 
provided their views about it.  Abuse and loss of language along with 
acknowledgment that the personal experiences within the IRS system varied 
were common themes among the responses. 
 
One participant was able to empathize with those who went and shared 
that "I'm disgusted with the priests and nuns who were supposed to be caring for 
them but were abusing them.  I feel the anguish the parents must have felt for 
having their kids taken."  Another participant stated that she thought it was a 
"good place for children to go" but "after hearing all those people's experiences, I 
think how could a nun or a priest do that to kids."  
 
The loss of language was clearly remembered by one participant who 
shared that: 
 
"The stories they told me, it sounded real hard.  They couldn't speak 
their language.  My dad said it seemed like you were always being 
punished.  Hope it never happens again.  And it's hard to remember 
stuff like that, my parents used to tell us stuff they went through.  
More so from my dad.  My dad said they were always planning to 
go, leave.  They planned to go across the river.  If they made it 

 
 
65 
home, they'd get caught.  If they made it to the Island, they got 
caught.  An island on the Spanish.  They would try to go in  the 
winter.  It was pretty cold out there.  He tried a few times to 
leave...He said it was hard to speak your language.  If one spoke 
his  language and got caught, all got punished.  We were told not to 
speak to one another in our language." 
 
Other participants were ambiguous and stated that "It was kinda wrong.  
My mom kept trying to run away from there.  There had to be something she was 
running away from," or as noted in the following, despite it being described as a 
"good place," there was still an identified need for protection while attending 
school: 
"I'm not sure.  My mom's point of view it was a  good place.  She 
had 3 meals a day and some girls protected her there.  My dad 
didn't like it.  He didn't say why.  I think he got hit in there because 
he had a scar on his ear.  My dad didn't talk much about the Indian 
Residential School.  Maybe because he didn't know much about 
what was going on in there or because he just didn't like attending 
school." [emphasis mine] 
 
2.4.5 Knowledge of IRS System and Participants' Family Members 
Involvement in the IRS System 
 
Every participant in the research project had immediate family members 
who attended the IRS system, either siblings, parents, grandparents and in one 
case, children, as well as extended family such as cousins or an uncle.  All 

 
 
66 
participants knew directly or were told directly about their family members 
involvement in the IRS system.  Most participants shared that they heard direct 
stories from family members about their experiences in the IRS system 
throughout their lives with the exception of one participant who directly asked her 
mother about her involvement in the IRS system when the Canadian 
government's formal apology was made.  This data establishes that the often 
traumatic experience of the IRS system whether it be the forced loss of language 
or physical and emotional abuse was known to family and community members 
and clearly illustrates how extensive the intergenerational effect of the IRS 
system can be as well has how pervasive historic trauma is within a community. 
2.4.6 IRS System Impact on Nishnaabemwin 
 
The loss of intergenerational transmission of Nishnaabemwin is the most 
significant impact of the IRS system on Nishnaabemwin.  Five of the eleven  
participants, 45.45% , almost half, made a conscious or sub-conscious choice to 
not speak Nishnaabemwin to their children with four of these participants (36%) 
being from Group 2.  While only two participants in the IRS system, 18% of all 
participants and 33% of Group 2, made a conscious choice to not speak 
Nishnaabemwin to their children, two other participants, 18% of all participants 
and 33% of Group 2, realized that there was a subconscious convenience or 
necessity for not speaking Nishnaabemwin to their children.  The two participants 
who made a direct and conscious choice to not speak Nishnaabemwin to their 
children were also the two participants who gave the lowest ratings for their 
experience in the IRS system.  One participant shared that "after all that I went 

 
 
67 
through in school, I decided to only speak English to the children.  I didn't want 
them to go through what I went through" while the other participant shared that 
she "just thought they would be better off with English.  I taught them little simple 
things." 
 
Those who made subconscious choices based on convenience or 
necessity related their experiences.  It is quite possible as well that a spouse's 
attendance in the IRS system was a key factor in the lack of ability to speak 
Nishnaabemwin.  When asked, one participant responded with "No, I didn't even 
think about it.  My ex-husband spoke a lot of English.  He hung out with white 
people, he worked off-reserve and without thinking, I spoke English.  We did 
speak Ojibwe though too."  The other participant stated "I don't know if it was 
conscious.  My wife didn't speak Ojibwe, just English so we just spoke English.  
My guess is that if my wife spoke Ojibwe my kids would have spoken Ojibwe." 
 
The subconscious decision to not speak Nishnaabemwin to one's children 
also extends to those who were not directly in the IRS system.  Although only 
one participant, 9% of all the participants and 20% of Group 1, shared this 
information, she relates that: 
"Sometimes I think the parents didn't teach their kids to speak 
[Ojibwe], they preferred the English language.  People said if you 
speak Ojibwe, they won't know anything about the English 
language.  I made that mistake.  I didn't teach my kids to speak 
Ojibwe.  When I hear today's kids not speaking the language, I'm 
just starting to realize, I think back, I realize I didn't teach my kids.  

 
 
68 
Both of us speak the language.  We used it in our home.  We didn't 
include the kids in the conversation."

While there was no direct link made to a family member's involvement in 
the IRS system, this participant's delayed realization (this realization occurred in 
2013) of her sub-conscious choice may be attributable to her knowledge of her 
parents' and other family members' experience in the IRS system.  This 
participant also may have been influenced by her friends and community who 
were non-speakers and who also may have made conscious or sub-conscious 
decisions to not speak Nishnaabemwin to their children in part because of the 
IRS system.  It is equally possible that the racism and negative stereotyping 
experienced by this participant effected her sub-conscious choice to not speak

Nishnaabemwin to her children.  There is also the possibility that all of the 
aforementioned, as contributing factors of historic trauma, significantly affected 
her sub-conscious choice.

CHAPTER THREE:  Racism, Ethnocentrism and Stereotypes 
- The Continuation of Historic Trauma 
 
3.1 The Continuation of Historic Trauma 
 
 
Racism is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits 
and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a 
particular race.6  This belief often led to the discrimination, marginalization or 
persecution of others with a different racial background.  The experience of  
being treated differently based on race is definitely subjective yet as Hudson 
Banks (2014) notes: 
"It is noteworthy that we do not conceptualize other interpersonal 
transgressions, such as trauma or neglect/abuse, as “perceived.”  
We acknowledge that the ways in which people perceive trauma 
vary; yet we do not qualify their experience as “perceived.” We do 
not wait until we can verify that the perpetrator intended to harm
 before validating the victim’s distress."(p. 312) 
 
Personal and collective experiences of racism especially in instances of 
marginalization for Indigenous people in Canada is a part of their historic trauma.  
Specifically, the historic trauma that aggravates the IRS experience of most 
survivors did not stop with the closing of the IRS system. The people who worked 
within the system, either in the schools or in the government departments, did not 
cease to exist. They continued to live their lives and how did they do so?  Did 
they heal from the trauma that they induced and experienced?  Did they justify

71 
their actions when they worked in the IRS system?  Did racism and stereotyping 
manifest itself within their lives, their families, their society?  Did any residual 
racist, ethnocentric and stereotyping behaviours and beliefs continue to affect the 
Aboriginal population?  Did the closure of the last IRS system door also shut a 
door on the multi-generational system of racism, ethnocentrism and stereotyping 
of Aboriginal people?  Without mechanisms in place such as public educational 
systems that teach a comprehensive Canadian and First Nations history, the 
answers to most of the questions would be in the negative. 
 
In the aftermath of the 'national crime' committed against Aboriginal 
peoples, the focus has been on the victims of the IRS and the national 'offender', 
the Canadian government, not the individuals who were responsible for the IRS 
system's day-to-day implementation and maintenance.  When the system was 
initially dismantled, there were no restorative justice measures implemented to 
discuss how communities were affected nor how the perpetrators, both in the 
national and individual sense, could right this wrong.  The apologies and the 
settlement process that began in the 1990s were undertaken by the Canadian 
government on behalf of the Canadian people that it represented by democratic 
process.  No Canadian individual has ever legally had to publicly make a 
personal apology for his or her actions or the actions of family members.  How do 
they ever resolve and overcome their individual and collective past that included 
complacency with a racist doctrine and ethnocentric practice?   
 
Tracing the current racism and stereotyping experienced by Aboriginal 
people today to the former employees of the IRS system would be difficult to do.  

 
 
72 
It is sufficient to say that the influence of some but not all past employees' views, 
beliefs, actions and justifications for those actions never left Canadian society 
and it contributes in part to the continuing racism and stereotyping of Aboriginal 
people.  Historic trauma is continually re-enforced with each new traumatic 
incident of racism experienced by Aboriginal people (Wesley-Esquimaux & 
Smolewski, 2004).   
 
How frequent is historic trauma re-enforced?  How often are Aboriginal 
people subjected to incidents of racism?  Based on what Urban Aboriginal people 
perceive, quite often for 71% of Urban Aboriginal people think that non-Aboriginal 
people's impression of Aboriginal people is generally negative (Environics 
Institute, 2010, p. 73).  Specifically, 74% of Urban Aboriginal people think that 
non-Aboriginal people believe that they have addictions issues and 30% of Urban 
Aboriginal people think that non-Aboriginal people believe that they are lazy and 
lack motivation (p. 74).  When presented with the statement, "I think others 
behave in an unfair/negative way toward Aboriginal people, 42% and 47% of 
Urban Aboriginal people strongly agreed and somewhat agreed respectively (p. 
78).  Revealingly, non-Aboriginal urban Canadians (39%) also believe that 
Aboriginal people are discriminated against often and another 44% believe that 
Aboriginal people experience discrimination sometimes (p.154).  That's almost 
half the non-Aboriginal population surveyed. 
 
These statements are echoed in current media venues as stories and 
images of social injustices and racism have been increasing.  Stories such as 
those about Robert Falcon Ouellette, a Winnipeg Metis mayoral candidate, who 

 
 
73 
has been subjected to racism during his campaign (CBC News, 2014, June 25) 
and Tenelle Starr, a 13 year old girl who was told by her school principal to stop 
wearing a shirt that read "Got Land, Thank an Indian" and created a national 
media and social storm over her 'right' to wear it (CBC News, 2014, January 14).  
Then there are the stories about the Canadian government's denial for a public 
inquiry into the more than 1100 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in 
Canada ( CBC News, 2014, March 10) despite its' recommendation by the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission (APTN National News, 2014, March 4) as 
well as the 34 hour long tortuous videotaped wait by Brian Sinclair for medical 
attention in a Winnipeg hospital that he never received (Keele, 2014). 
 
Academically, professionally and internationally there are documented 
studies of the racism, an aspect of historical trauma that still burdens Canada.  
Irfan Chaudhry, a doctoral candidate at the University of Alberta, recently 
discussed his research findings on social media instances of racism (Krishnan, 
2014).  Chaudhry states: "Although this data is very tentative, it is interesting to 
see that the cities with the highest number of Aboriginal residents (Winnipeg, 
Edmonton, and Calgary) have the term natives used most often in a negative 
context in the tweets gathered for this study"(p.1). 
 
At the September, 2014 Saskatchewan Legal Aid Conference, James T.D. 
Scott presented a paper that he wrote, Reforming Saskatchewan's Biased 
Sentencing Regime that details the systemic racism that Aboriginal people 
continue to face in the Saskatchewan legal system.  Based on the sentencing 
statistics garnered from the Canadian Legal Information Institute's website from 

 
 
74 
1999 to June of 2014, it was found that the Gladue principles which provide 
guidance for judges when sentencing Aboriginal people, were not applied in 169 
of 192 decisions (Scott, 2014a, p. 2).  It was also found that offenders identified 
as Aboriginal were sentenced on average to more than twice as much custodial 
time as those who had no indication that they were Aboriginal (p. 2). 
 
Also released in late 2014 is McInturff & Tulloch's Narrowing the Gap: The 
Difference that Public Sector Wages Make which echoes Pendakur & Pendakur's 
(2008) Aboriginal Income Disparity in Canada, reports that, "the biggest wage 
gap exists for aboriginal workers. In the private sector, aboriginal workers earn 
between 30%–44% less than non-aboriginal workers with the same level of 
education. Education appears to make very little difference in closing this gap as 
an aboriginal worker with a university degree can expect to take home fully 44% 
less than their non-aboriginal peers" (p.14). What is disheartening about the 
portrait presented by these employment and educational statistics is that it 
breeds a sense of lack of control over one's wellbeing especially when 
considering that the main reason Aboriginal children are apprehended by child 
protection agencies is due to neglect which is directly linked to poverty 
(MacLaurin, Trocmé, Fallon, Blackstock, Pitman, &. McCormack, 2006). This 
poverty can be seen to be unavoidable due to a 'sticky floor and glass ceiling' 
that prevents Aboriginal families from staying together. This sense of lack of 
control over one's wellbeing is part of the historical trauma that still festers in 
Canada. 

 
 
75 
 
Aboriginal people's experience with racism extends to the health care 
system as is detailed in two recent reports. The Health Council of Canada's 
(December 2012) report Empathy, dignity and respect: Creating cultural safety 
for Aboriginal people in urban health care was initiated due to the fact that many 
Aboriginal people are distrustful of the health care system where they are fearful 
of racism.  Allan & Smylie (2015) explored the issue of racism and Indigenous 
health more in depth in First Nations, Second Class Treatment: the role of racism 
in the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. 
 
On an international level, Canada's dishonourable relations with 
Indigenous Peoples were detailed in July of 2014 via a special report by the 
United Nations.  Anaya (2014) concludes that "the numerous initiatives that have 
been taken at the federal and provincial/territorial levels to address the problems 
faced by indigenous peoples have been insufficient" (p. 1). The report detailed 
that: 
"the well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in 
Canada has not narrowed over the past several years; treaty and 
aboriginal claims remain persistently unresolved; indigenous women 
and girls remain vulnerable to abuse; and overall there appear to be 
high levels of distrust among indigenous peoples towards the 
government at both the federal and provincial levels" (p.1)   
The intergenerational racism in Canada is clearly becoming more publicized and 
well documented and clearly illustrates the continuing oppression, the historic 
trauma of Indigenous peoples. 

 
 
76 
 
3.2  Ethnocentrism and Nishnaabemwin 
 
Ethnocentrism is defined as "the belief in the inherent superiority of one's 
own ethnic group or culture" and it is "a tendency to view alien groups or cultures 
from the perspective of one's own."7  Ethnocentrism not only views outside 
groups and cultures from the perspective of one's own but it also ranks others in 
relation to one's own thereby creating a sociological hierarchy for those with the 
power and influence to put their ethnocentrism in effect.  Ethnocentrism fueled  
many social movements, perhaps one of the most notable extreme is that of the 
Nazi regime in Germany that saw the extermination of approximately 6 million 
members of the races that it believed were inferior to their own. Similarly, the 'red' 
Indian was seen as a hindrance to 'white progress' on both sides of the 
Canadian/American border and Indian wars sought to eradicate the 'Indian 
problem.' 
 
As discussed in Chapter Two, in Canada, ethnocentrism underpinned the 
social, political, economic and legal policies relating to Aboriginal peoples as is 
most evident in the various Indian Acts legislated. These Acts violated many 
basic rights for Aboriginal peoples such as the freedom of movement and 
spiritual practice in the belief that the Canadian government, based on their own 
race and culture, knew what was best for Aboriginal people.  The government 
sought to restrict Aboriginal people's lives in the ethnocentric belief that its own 
cultural standards and national agenda were more important.  As Canadian 
society grew and its personal contact with First Nations communities decreased, 
                                                           
7 Random House Webster's College Dictionary 

 
 
77 
ethnocentric judgement of First Nations culture and language became common.  
Just in the context of how First Nations "religions" were viewed, Angel (2002)  
writes that "numerous scrolls, religious ceremonial objects, and medicine bundles 
were either destroyed or lost during the Midewiwin's decline-largely as a result of 
the efforts of governments and Christian religious bodies to erase all traces of 
Aboriginal religion" (p. 16).  For Indigenous languages, theories of social 
evolution and ethnocentrism often saw their documentation but in an 
environment that viewed them as primitive, 'lower' and not worthy of being saved 
from extinction (Crawford, 1996).  In the context of Nishnaabemwin, 
ethnocentrism affects it in three key ways: national language policy; public school 
curriculum; and language resources. 
 
Language policy shapes patterns of language use in a variety of social 
spheres like courts and schools and has a direct impact on language use.  It is 
also noteworthy that even though a policy may appear supportive, if it is not 
enforceable, it is not really so (Grenoble & Whaley, 2006, p. 26).  Canada's 
language policies have hindered Nishnaabemwin retention and revitalization for 
regardless of the formal apologies for the IRS system that prevented children 
from speaking their own language, Canada continues to display an ethnocentric 
attitude in its policies for Aboriginal languages and their precarious state of rapid 
decline.  It is a continuance of the historic trauma suffered by Aboriginal peoples 
in Canada.  Most evident of this is the government's 2006 decision to "eliminate 
$110 million from the $160 million dedicated to Indigenous languages" 
(Pitawanankwat, 2009, p. 30; Meades, 2011, p. 92).  That this came at a time 

 
 
78 
when there wasn't a large national deficit clearly shows the lack of importance 
accorded to First Nations' languages.  The Task Force on Aboriginal Languages 
and Culture [TFALC] (2005) found the federal government to be deficient when it 
came to funding Aboriginal language programs in comparison to French 
language programs. 
 
Most obvious of all, however, is the exclusion of First Nations' languages 
from being recognized as official national languages, unlike Hawaii, Montana, 
Norway and Alaska, despite a recommendation for this (RCAP, 1996d, p. 42).   
The multiplicity of First Nations languages in Canada, over 60 languages 
grouped into 12 distinct language groups (Statistics Canada, 2012), should not 
deter the government from according them official status for Alaska has 
demonstrated that it is possible when it legislated the addition of twenty 
Indigenous languages to official language status (Smith, 2014).  It was also 
determined that there had to be sufficient funding to support programs for these 
official languages (TFALC, 2005). 
 
Currently, Canada's Department of Canadian Heritage has an Aboriginal 
Peoples Program that includes an Aboriginal Languages Initiative (ALI) that 
states its objective is to "support the preservation and revitalization of 
Aboriginal languages for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples and other 
Canadians" (Canadian Heritage, 2015).  The expected outcomes of the ALI 
are: 1) Aboriginal people have access to community-based projects and 
activities that support the preservation and revitalization of Aboriginal 
languages and cultures; 2) Aboriginal communities are assisted in their efforts 

 
 
79 
to enhance languages and cultures; and 3) Aboriginal languages and cultures 
are preserved and enhanced as living cultures (Canadian Heritage, 2015).  
Examples of initiatives that would be eligible for ALI funding include 
community-based activities such as :  
 
1)recording, documenting and preserving endangered Aboriginal 
 
languages; 
 
2)developing materials to increase Aboriginal language use and 
 
proficiency;  
 
3) developing programs for training and certifying Aboriginal language 
 
teachers and resource people in the community;  
 
 
4)developing systems for facilitating communications in Aboriginal 
 
languages;  
 
5)promoting traditional approaches to learning, such as language  
 
camps, immersion programs, etc; and 
 
6) developing mechanisms for digital tools to share information, 
 
materials, and other resources among Aboriginal language  groups" 
 
(Canadian Heritage, 2015). 
 
While this program appears supportive, the long term maintenance of 
community based programs such as those focussed on adult Aboriginal 
Second-Language Acquisition as well as urban immersion schools do not 
seem adequately supported under the ALI initiative especially since core 
funding for staffing of such programs is ineligible under the ALI mandate and 
funding is not provided on a three, five or even ten year basis (Meades, 2011). 

 
 
80 
Given the historical circumstances of the IRS system that purposefully sought 
to eradicate Aboriginal language and culture, the nature and scope of 
Aboriginal mother tongue loss and revitalization would need to address both of 
these areas and include core funding for staffing and institutions for sustained 
periods of time. 
 
Differing historical, cultural, political and economic reasons shape a 
country's views on multilingualism and there is often a 'pervasive sentiment' that 
multilingualism will break down communities and create inequalities as well as be 
a cost burden for the translation of materials into many languages (Grenoble & 
Whaley, 2006, p. 30).  It is noted that the United States, Australia, Canada and 
Russia have been 'historically non-tolerant of multilingualism' although in 
Russia's case, it did assist in the development of minority languages during the 
Soviet Union era (Comrie, 1981).  Overall though, this view has led to negative 
policies at the national level and a negative attitude at the local level (Grenoble & 
Whaley, p. 30).  This is very true for Canada where the historic trauma that 
resonates today with the continued ethnocentric Canadian policies gives rise to a 
negative attitude, an 'ennui' at the local level that was reported at a 2012 
Sagamok Anishnawbek language forum when some people question why they 
need Nishnaabemwin in the world outside the reserve.  
 
Canada's ethnocentrism towards First Nations languages is also shown 
when "The government, [however], does not promote the use of First Nations 
languages in schools, such as Cree or Ojibwe, which are not recognized as 
official languages of Canada" (Grenoble & Whaley, 2006, p. 12).  Education is 

 
 
81 
seen as a critical domain for a language and UNESCO has declared that 
"Education in the language is essential for language vitality"(Grenoble & Whaley,  
p. 10).  This is a very clear standard that Canada fails to uphold in respect of First 
Nations' languages maintenance and revitalization. 
 
The general school environment is ethnocentric through its exclusion of 
Aboriginal history, contemporary issues and First Nations language instruction as 
well as the lack of formal acknowledgement of First Nations knowledge keepers 
as noted by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: 
"lack of recognition by educators (at the elementary, high school
 and post-secondary levels) of the competence of elders and other 
fluent speakers as teachers in the school system. Because elders 
and other potential teachers do not hold formal qualifications, their 
unique expertise has not been acknowledged. They have been 
barred from teaching opportunities and compensation 
commensurate with their expertise," (RCAP, 1996c, p. 41) 
 
The school environment conveys the ethnocentric message that they are 
not important in relation to non-Aboriginal history, contemporary issues and 
language instruction.  In TVOParents (2013b), Dr. Pamela Toulouse states that 
"the omission of First Nation, Metis and Inuit history and culture is also a form of 
racism" and further adds that "The key to First Nation, Metis and Inuit students 
especially elementary and secondary is the ability to see yourself, your culture, 
your language, worldview, inventions, innovations reflected for all students" 
(TVOParents, 2013a). This ethnocentric environment can be devastating for 

 
 
82 
Aboriginal students (Nicholas, 2011; Grant, 2004; Miller, 1996; Neegan, 2005; 
Pitawanakwat, 2009; RCAP, 1996c; Young, 2005).  Pitawanakwat (2009) 
describes how his mother "was sent to an integrated English public school where 
assimilative pressures were in many respects equal to, or even greater, than 
those at the coercive residential schools"(p. 40).   
 
Ethnocentrism is also evident in the academic work that has been done in 
Nishnaabemwin.  With the decrease in federal money for Aboriginal languages, it 
is more difficult to develop resources such as current audio recordings of fluent 
speakers or community dictionaries which then results in a greater reliance on 
the resources that are available, regardless of how dated they are in regards to 
linguistic research methods and limited in linguistic scope as a result or how 
ethnocentric they may be. The use of ethnocentric resources to assist in reviving 
a language that has become endangered by the very same ideology is 
insensitive and in many situations, would not be lost on some learners just as the 
Black inmates who were subjected to culturally inappropriate educational 
materials protested against it (Office of the Correctional Investigator, 2013, p. 
11).8  Two commonly used and referenced Nishnaabemwin sources that show 
ethnocentrism within their text are Baraga's (1850) A Theoretical and Practical 
Grammar of the Otchipwe Language and Wilson's (1874) The Ojibway 
Language: a manual for missionaries and others employed among the Ojibway 
Indians.   
                                                           
8 This section does not mean to detract from those who have embraced Christianity and who benefited 
from translations of the Bible and hymnals into Indigenous languages. 

 
 
83 
 
Baraga (1850) exhibits ethnocentrism as shown in some of the sentence 
examples he provides: "thou hast done evil because those hast travelled on 
Sunday," "the Lord does not love pagans," "you who are not Christians, are 
miserable," "Pagans, have mercy on yourselves; you are precipitating yourselves 
into eternal misery, if you hate religion," "we are happy now, because we have 
rejected (abandoned) the Indian mood of living, and have taken religion," "We 
behave shamefully, because we are sinning always"(pp. 124, 153, 126, 335, 368, 
405).  The intended reader for Baraga's work was the missionary and the 
statements that are being translated for the missionaries to use with the Ojibwe 
are ones that are very clearly praising and enforcing a culture other than the 
Ojibwe one while degrading and demeaning the Ojibwe culture to potential 
converts and students. 
 
Wilson (1874) also exhibits ethnocentrism.  He states that the Ojibwe 
language "is not a written one, and, though by some considered musical, is very 
deficient in its phonetic elements, the Alphabet consisting only of nineteen letters, 
those which are wanting being, c, f, h, l, r, v, and x" (p. iv).  Given Wilson's 
background as the 'founder' of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, part of 
the system that saw fit to eradicate Indigenous languages because they were 
deemed inferior and because it broke a bond within the culture, it is not surprising 
that Wilson would find the Ojibwe language 'very deficient' because it only has 19 
letters.  Undoubtedly, he is comparing Ojibwe to English and it is in this 
comparison that he finds Ojibwe very deficient, as were the people who had to be 
removed from their culture and taught a more "civilized way" of life. 

 
 
84 
 
Wilson (1874) further provides advice on learning the "flow of the 
language" by comparing Ojibwe phrases with "nonsensical" English rhymes.  The 
rhymes appear mocking as in such phrases as "calm ye ninny, sit ye down" or "In 
a fishy tub."(p. 13)  When childish and mocking rhymes are used to show the flow 
of Ojibwe it shows that the language is not taken seriously, that it too is childish 
and consequently, deserving of being mocked.  This is definitely ethnocentric.   
 
As shown, the effects of an ethnocentric national language policy, public 
school curriculum and ethnocentric language resources on the individual can be 
extremely negative and accounts in part for First Nations language attrition rates 
and declining rates of Indigenous languages as a mother tongue. Without doubt, 
it leaves an emotional impact for both the direct and intergenerational survivor.  
Aboriginal people are reminded that their languages are seen as inferior. This 
continuing racism and stereotyping can be seen as a continuation of the historic 
trauma experienced by Aboriginal people.   
3.3 Research Analysis 
3.3.1. Participant Views About Racism and Negative Stereotyping and 
Impacts 
 
 
All participants in the research project stated that they experienced racist 
negative stereotypes and there was a range in the type of experience including 
incidents in the public school system and other local venues like the workplace, 
the hospital, stores, sports events and even in church. One participant stated that 
the lack of funding for Nishnaabemwin teachers was a form of racism. The 
impacts of racism and negative stereotyping included anger, sadness, fear, the 

 
 
85 
lowering of self-esteem and decreased use of Nishnaabemwin.  There was also a 
defiance, a resilience to maintain and uphold the Nishnaabek culture. 
  
The racism and stereotyping that the participants endured in the public 
school system were the most prevalent.  One woman shared that: 
"I guess I learned early in Grade 2 that speaking my language was 
not desirable.  It wasn't a proud thing to mention you were from the 
reserve.  When I got to high school, I was told only sluts came from 
my reserve.  I was told by another student that us Natives have it 
too easy, we don't have to work for anything and that is why we are 
lazy.  It lowered my self-esteem and made me ashamed to be 
Anishnaabe-kwe.  It made me wish to have a child that didn't have 
dark skin, dark hair."   
 
Another participant shared that she was afraid to speak Nishnaabemwin 
"because of what happened to me in school.  Indian was all I spoke, when I got 
to school, I had to learn English and not speak Ojibwe."  A third participant 
shared that "in high school, it was always Natives against Whites.  They always 
made fun of the Natives.  People would call Nishnaabekwek 'squaws.'  I would go 
after those ladies in the washroom, those who said racist things." 
  
The other local venues where racism and negative stereotyping were 
noted to take place included the hospital, church, sports events and stores. One 
participant shared that on a group visit to the hospital, "I talked with another  
Native woman in Ojibwe.  I sensed that some white women in our group did not 
like it."  This same participant also shared that: 

 
 
86 
"when I speak Ojibwe in Church, I get answered back in English.  If
 French people talk in French in Church, I don't say anything.  If I'm 
 with my friend and I see a Native person I know and I talk in Ojibwe,
 she doesn't like it.  I asked her why it is okay when she does talk in 
French and not okay for us to talk in Ojibwe." 
It was also disclosed that this same woman "lost friends over it."  The impacts for 
this participant included feeling "sad and angry" and sometimes fear "to tell 
people I'm Ojibwe."  Another participant shared that her general racist 
experiences "made you think you should be ashamed to be Indian, that you are 
something to be ashamed of, ashamed to speak your language.  That's not right 
to think like that."  This same participant also shared that because of this, "For a 
long time I never spoke. " 
 
One participant shared that he experiences racism in the local stores and 
also when "hockey was played between Massey and Sagamok, more racism 
came out." These experiences impacted him enough that now he "won't shop in 
Massey or talk to people in Massey unless I need to."  He also added that "the 
negativity re-enforces my culture" while also providing his own explanation for the 
racism, "it's not really their problem that they behave that way, they don't 
understand us, that we are unique with special status.  They can't comprehend 
this and it leads to negative racism towards us." 
 
This resiliency or re-enforcement of culture was common with other 
participants who shared that the racism and negative stereotypes "made me 
stronger, I'm not afraid to say anything," or " It makes me more stronger in my 

 
 
87 
vision to share my knowledge and culture to others."  One participant shared that 
along with protecting her language and culture, she would not let racism or 
negative stereotyping affect her use of Nishnaabemwin as did another 
participant, "I think we are stronger than to let those words bother us.  We keep 
on going [and] if I want to speak it [Nishnaabemwin], I speak it.  If they don't like 
it, they can just deal with it."  Another participant shared that she "got certification 
to teach language so that I could help anyone, young or old, relearn the language 
and the Grandfather teachings." while another participant stated that his 
experiences: 
"made me want to do it [speak Nishnaabemwin] more.  You can't 
stop me.  The more they didn't like it, the more I wanted to. The 
more they heard it, then they started to accept it.  They would ask 
how to say certain words.  Instead of me changing for them, I got 
them to change for me and accept it." 
 
3.3.2 Participant Views About Overcoming Negative Racist Stereotypes 
 
Despite the negative racist experiences and stereotypes endured by the 
participants and their impacts, most were able to envision a better future where 
racism was lessened.  When asked how can negative racist stereotypes be 
overcome, several ideas emerged: 1) educated and visionary leadership who are 
able to fight for Anishnaabek rights; 2) positive Anishnaabek self-identity and a 
focus on positive accomplishments; and 3) have people experience Anishnaabek 
culture like going to a pow wow or learning the language instead of " just reading 
about it or watching on tv."  One participant was more candid and stated that in 

 
 
88 
order to get rid of racism, Anishnaabek need to "kick their butts" and "if they did 
not like it they could go back to where they came from."   
 
Some participants did not think it possible that racism could be stopped. 
One participant stated that "as long as there is envy, there is racism.  There is 
not too much to do.  Those kind of people don't change, they get worse.  They 
end up KKK or like Hitler."  Others stated that it could be lessened.  One 
participant stated that in order to do that "it has to be incorporated in the school 
system, elementary, secondary, post-secondary and by an authentic, certified 
course, not one taught from a book by non-Natives."  Another participant stated 
that: 
"you have to be outspoken.  'Maanoo' is the worst word, "let it 
happen, let it be."  You have to say no sometimes.  Stand up for 
what is right for everyone... Don't think we can ever get rid of racism 
as long as there are different colours of people, different races.  But 
if they work together, if there is a common goal, maybe."

CHAPTER FOUR: Language and Identity 
4.1 Language and Identity in Aboriginal Culture 
 
Language is our ability to communicate with each other yet for as simple 
as that may seem, language is a complex societal infrastructure. 
"The scope and diversity of human thought and experience place 
great demands on language.  Because communication is not 
restricted to a fixed set of topics, language must do something more 
than provide a package of ready-made messages. It must enable 
us to produce and understand new words, phrases, and sentences 
as the need arises.  In short, human language must be creative-
allowing novelty and innovation in response to  new thoughts, 
experiences and situations." (O'Grady & Dobrovolsky, 1996, p. 1) 
 
 
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996d) reports that 
"language is the principal instrument by which culture is transmitted from one 
generation to another, by which members of a culture communicate meaning and 
make sense of their shared experience" (p. 22).  This view was shared by TFALC 
(2005), a national survey with a mandate "to propose a national strategy to 
preserve, revitalize and promote First Nation, Inuit and Métis languages and 
cultures" (p. i).  The language is just as important as the oral traditions that are 
transmitted through the language.  For the Anishnaabek, "oral tradition provides 
subtle lessons in spiritual beliefs, traditions, protocol, laws and morals which are 

 
 
90 
essential tools in learning about ourselves, and serve to guide us in our 
endeavours" (Wilder & Wemigwans, 1999, p. 8).  Johnston (1990) when 
describing what will happen if Nishnaabemwin dies, writes: 
"They lose not only the ability to express the simplest of daily 
sentiments and needs but they can no longer understand the ideas, 
concepts, insights, attitudes, rituals, ceremonies, institutions 
brought into being by their ancestors; and, having lost the power to 
understand, cannot sustain, enrich, or pass on their heritage.  No 
longer will they think Indian or feel Indian.  And though they may 
wear "Indian" jewellery and take part in pow-wows, they can never 
capture that kinship with and reverence for the sun and the moon, 
the sky and the water, or feel the lifebeat of Mother Earth or sense 
the change in her moods; no longer are the wolf, the bear and the 
caribou elder brothers but beasts, resources to be killed and sold.  
 They will have lost their identity which no amount of reading can 
ever restore.  Only language and literature can restore the "Indian-
ness." (p. 10) 
 
Treuer (2012) and Angel (2002) both echo this belief.  Angel (2002) writes 
that historical documents although biased and prejudiced, "provide a convincing 
picture of a society that had developed an holistic cosmological system, which 
was embedded in their language and all aspects of their social structure" (p. x) 
while Treuer (2012) states that: 

 
 
91 
"To claim that Indian cultures can continue without Indian 
languages only hastens our end, even if it makes us feel better 
about ourselves.  Our cultures and our languages-as unique, 
identifiable, and particular entities-are linked to our sovereignty.  If 
we allow our own wishful thinking and complacency to finish what 
George Armstrong Custer began, we will lose what we've managed 
to retain: our languages, land, laws, institutions, ceremonies, and, 
finally, ourselves.  Cultural death matters because if the culture 
dies, we will have lost the chance not only to live on our own terms 
(something for which our ancestors fought long and hard) but also 
to live in our own terms." (p. 261)   
  
As Johnston (1990) notes, identity is closely tied to language and culture.  
This view is shared by many (Cowell, 2012; Crawford, 1995; Goodfellow, 2005; 
Joseph, 2010; Juutilainen et al, 2014; McIvor, Napoleon & Dickie, 2009; 
McMarty, Romero & Zepeda, 2006; Norris, 1998, 2007; Quirk, 2000; RCAP, 
1996d; TFALC, 2005).  Self-identity is our very existence, our meaning for the 
continued breath that we breathe.  Our perception of ourselves and how we are 
connected in humanity, our world and the cosmos around us begins with our first 
observations within our mothers' wombs.  From childhood to old age, as we grow 
and mature, we contemplate and challenge this existence.  Our self-identity 
evolves throughout our lives with some aspects remaining constant while other 
facets are revealed and yet others abandoned.  External factors such as family 
expectations, social norms, the environment, community roles and internal 

 
 
92 
determinants such as mental aptitude or physical prowess influence our self-
identity.   
 
Group identity is the acceptance in and of an individual to a subset of 
individuals that espouse similar identifiers such as language, religion or spiritual 
belief, race or political creed.  Group identity includes the adherence to the norms 
and values of the subset that the individual may or may not have a part in 
determining.  Group identity serves to protect the individual and provides an 
alliance, a kinship with others striving for similar goals such as equality of gender, 
economic rights, freedom of expression or choice of what type of food to eat and 
grow. 
 
Personal identity was very valued in Aboriginal cultures and like all 
cultures, Aboriginal peoples have a wealth of identity strengthening practices and 
rituals (Miller, 1996; RCAP, 1996d; TRC, 2012b).  The Anishnaabek of the mid-
northern Ontario region who were the subjects of this research project, have their 
own specific rites of passages including the following: 
"When a Sagamok Anishnawbek child was born in the traditional 
past, it was born into a family and community system that was 
connected both to the earth and to the Creator.  These two 
connections were symbolized at the moment of a child's birth when 
the grandmother guides the child out of the mother's birth canal, 
and the grandfather places a tiny pinch of tobacco in one hand, and 
a tiny pinch of earth in the other."(Bopp & Lane, 2003, p. 9) 

 
 
93 
This first sacred ceremony and other rites of passage such as makatewin 
(fasting) that strengthened personal and community identity continued throughout 
the individual's lifetime.  With a strong personal and community identity came 
greater harmony in the community. 
 
The importance of language and identity is seen in one group's response 
to the IRS system whereby they identified learning or relearning their traditional 
languages is a healing method (Barlow, 2009, p. 34).  This belief is also shared 
in Kipp (2000) while Elder and Nishnaabemwin advocate Shirley Williams shares 
that : "Teaching helped me to heal myself because as I was teaching, I also 
grew.  In the language there are a lot of words and some of these are healing 
words.  Last year I did a workshop on healing words" (AHF, 2006a, p. 6). 
 
Likewise for Indigenous youth, the use of Indigenous language is seen as 
being a positive factor for the health and wellness (McIvor, Napoleon & Dickie, 
2009, p. 6).  Wright & Taylor (1995) found that instruction in an individual's 
heritage language, in this case Inuit, helped create healthy self-esteem (p. 241).  
Also, it was found that immersion in an Indigenous language was more beneficial 
in terms of developing Indigenous language skills while also allowing for the 
eventual attainment (after two years) of English skills equivalent to programs 
where the Indigenous language was taught as a second language (Usborne, 
Peck, Smith & Taylor, 2011, p. 200). 
 
In Bopp & Lane (2003), some members of Sagamok Anishnawbek voiced 
concern that "many Sagamok children are growing up without learning the 
fundamentals of Anishinawbe history, cultural values, language, and identity" (p. 

 
 
94 
7).  There is community recognition that colonialism and the IRS system have 
eroded the person, the family, the language, and the culture (Four Worlds Centre 
for Development Learning [FWCDL], 2012) as was set out in Chapter Two.  It is 
also acknowledged that members of the community face systemic racism and 
discrimination outside of the reserve and that this too impacts identity and 
wellness (Bopp & Lane, 2003).   
4.1.1 Participants Views on Language, Culture and Identity 
 
All of the participants learned their language in a home environment.  The 
foremost theme that emerged from participants' responses to questions about 
their language and culture was a deep love of the language as evidenced by the 
following: 
"My language is very precious.  Those words were spoken to me as 
a baby, to instruct me, teach me, comfort me.  It's very precious.  
 I'm sad I can't use it all the time.  I miss the quiet time.  You took the 
time to hear the noise of wildlife, natural sounds, the whip-or-will, 
loon.  Now your kids are in front of the tv and video games.  We 
listened to our grandparents or moms and dads or aunts and 
uncles, it depends on who was telling the story.  The kids sat still.  
We listened.  There was a closeness.  Not today. It's a machine for
 everything.  They got no stories to tell." [emphasis mine] 
 
Others indicated that they were "sorry that we are losing it.  The young 
people should try [to speak the language].  At the language conference I talk 
about that" or "I wish everybody would talk more of it" and "they [language and 

 
 
95 
culture] are important.  We shouldn't lose them."  This sense of love and pride in 
the language was evident  regardless of whether all aspects of traditional 
Nishnaabe culture were adhered to as shared by one participant: 
"I am proud to be Native, Ojibwe but on that same note, I don't 
understand nor practice those teachings or principles more 
traditional people have, like drumming , ceremonies.  I'm happy just 
being an Indian.  In my travels where I have lived, whenever I met 
other Native people especially Ojibwe, if we happen to speak 
Ojibwe, it's a common bond, it's instant." 
 
The link between language and culture was also evident as shared by one 
participant: 
"My language and culture are something to be embraced by me.  It 
is who I am.  I wish it hadn't been so hidden.  I wish I could have 
been raised to be proud to be Nishnaabekwe.  I was told I was 
French, Scottish and then Ojibwe was mentioned at the end.  
Ojibwe should have been mentioned first.  I say that now, Ojibwe 
with a small part French and Scottish." 
 
Another participant made the very clear distinction of why language and 
identity are so strongly linked together, "when you talk English, you are thinking 
in English, like a white person.  When you talk Indian, you are thinking like an 
Indian."  Others focused on the reasons why Nishnaabe language and culture 
were struggling in the communities: 1) the government should have made a 
language fund for the IRS system attendees; 2) Nishnaabemwin should be 

 
 
96 
included in the school system just like the French language is; and 3) we should 
be teaching others and encouraging the youth to try to learn it.  As well, one 
participant put the onus on the individual to maintain the language and the 
culture when she shared that: 
"We were raised, brought up to respect the Elders.  We were always 
told that you should never laugh out in public because people will 
think you are laughing at them.  A lot of kids don't speak the 
language.  A lot bring it back to the Indian Residential School.  Too 
many people  fall back on the Indian Residential School, that they 
don't know the language or the culture." 
 
When asked if it was important to teach Nishnaabemwin to the younger 
generation, eight of the 11 participants responded with a direct yes along with 
some observations like "or part of our uniqueness dies," "if we don't, we lose it 
all," and "How are we going to exist if we don't know our language.  It's what kept 
us going all these years."  Three participants (two from sub-Group A, one from 
sub-Group C) gave conditional affirmatives.  One participant stated "If they are 
going to use it.  If they are only teaching and speaking in school, then it seems 
like a waste of time.  It's sad though.  They could help translate though for 
someone who does not speak English."  Another participant stated that: 
"It probably is for the purpose of retaining our heritage and our 
cultural values but at the same time it should not be the primary 
choice of language because we have to understand that English is 
the spoken word of choice in the global setting.  Whether on 

 
 
97 
facebook, on the phone, on the computer, it's all in English." 
 
A third participant shared that "If they want to learn.  If they want to think 
like an Indian." 
 
The participants were also generally positive about their level of fluency in 
Nishnaabemwin with the exception of two participants.  One shared that she did 
not think that she was fluent because at times she had been afraid to speak her 
language while the other participant gave the lowest self-assessment (2.5) 
because she could not read or write it.  The same individual who stated that she 
did not think that she was fluent still gave a high rating for her level of skill in 
Nishnaabemwin, (4.5).  Overall, the participants' average self-rating was 4.27 or 
4.18 out of five (the two numbers reflect one participant's answer of "3 or 4").  
Sub-group C had the highest average of 5, Sub-group A had the second highest 
with 4.33, Group 1 had an average of 4 and Sub-group B had an average score 
of 3 or 4.  
 
This data shows a group who love Nishnaabemwin immensely, they take 
pride and joy in their language abilities and they believe that it should be passed 
onto future generations.  
4.2 Language Loss and Revitalization 
 
Loss of language is manifested in four key areas: 1) the number of 
speakers declines; 2) fluency in language increase with age as younger 
generations prefer to speak another (usually dominant societal) tongue; 3) usage 
declines in "domains" where the language was once secure - e.g., in churches, 
cultural observances, schools, and most important, the home; and 4) growing 

 
 
98 
numbers of parents fail to teach the language to their children (Crawford, 1995, 
pp. 45-56).  It is an ongoing global problem hastened in part by globalization and 
other political and socio-economic factors.  Nations and states that have 
struggled with maintaining linguistic heritage are Ireland, Norway, Hawaii, New 
Zealand, Australia, Navajo Nation, Israel and of course, Canada where only three 
Aboriginal languages are expected to survive for another generation - Inuktitut, 
Cree and Ojibwe (Norris, 1998, 2004).   
 
In Canada, between 1996 and 2001, there was a 5% decrease in the 
number of Aboriginal people who said that they could converse in their language 
(Norris, 2007, p. 1).  Between 2006 and 2011, there was a 4.5% decline of  
Aboriginal language knowledge (AANDC, 2013).  There is also a decline in the 
number of mother tongue speakers of Aboriginal languages which is an early 
indication of language death for the home is viewed as the most important 
domain for language transmission to take place (Grenoble & Whaley, 2006;  
Hinton & Hale, 2001; Norris, 2007; RCAP, 1996d).   
 
As discussed in the previous section the importance that is attached to 
language and identity fuels Indigenous language revitalization on both a personal 
and community level.  In the post-IRS system era, this is becoming increasingly 
so as many realize how Indigenous languages were intentionally and 
systematically attacked during the IRS system regime.  All too often though a 
question raised is - where to begin? 
 
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal People (1996d, p. 42) set out key 
recommendations for language revitalization: 

 
 
99 
 
(a) assessing the current state of Aboriginal language use and vitality; 
 
(b) determining priorities of communities for language conservation, 
 
revitalization and documentation; 
 
(c) consulting on the most effective means of implementing priorities; 
 
(d) facilitating initiatives to support Aboriginal language use in families and 
 
the broader community; 
 
(e) incorporating their Aboriginal language in education policies and 
 
programs; 
 
(f) enhancing co-operation among nations and communities of the same 
 
language group to promote research, curriculum development and 
 
language elaboration; 
 
(g) using their Aboriginal language in public forums and Aboriginal 
 
government business; and 
 
(h) declaring their Aboriginal language an official language on nation 
 
 territory  
 
When determining the first of RCAP's recommendations, assessing the 
current state of Aboriginal language use and vitality, Whaley & Grenoble (2006, 
p. 4 ) list the criteria set out by UNESCO for assessing language vitality for 
endangered languages:  
 
1) intergenerational transmission; 2) absolute number of speakers; 3) 
 
proportion of speakers within the population; 4) trends in existing language 
 
domains; 5) response to new domains and media; 6) materials of 
 
language education and literacy; 7) government and institutional policies 

 
 
100 
 
on language; 8) community members' own view of their language; and 9) 
 
amount and quality of documentation. 
 
Hinton & Hale (2001) state that the focus should be on community based 
language planning and not on external forms of language planning such as 
national level or public school administration level.  Hinton & Hale (2001) also 
stress the importance of language planning which: 1) helps community set goals 
and find effective strategies; 2) helps community monitor goals and the 'big 
picture'; 3) helps ensure that the community is in control and not outsiders; 4) 
helps coordinate similar efforts; 5) can help prevent factionalism and rivalry that 
could hinder language revitalization.  It is key that a long term, multi-faceted 
program is put in place with just as much resources as personal dedication 
(Grenoble & Whaley, 2006). 
 
Some creative and effective examples of language revitalization include 
the following three.  The Acoma Pueblo community survey found that early 
English introduction undermined the Acoma language and that adult education 
was needed to supplement children's Acoma language education (Hinton & Hale, 
2001).  The expansion of language domains by utilizing an Irish language radio 
program in Ireland which featured 12 hour broad casts, a strict no English policy 
that extends to song lyrics, and creation of an inter-dialect unity (Hinton & Hale, 
2001).  The Piegan Institute in Montana utilizes an immersion program for 
Blackfoot that primarily uses the Total Physical Response teaching methodology 
and a Blackfoot oriented curriculum and environment (Kipp, 2000). 

 
 
101 
 
Immersion programs are seen as the most effective (Usborne & Taylor, 
2014; Hinton & Hale, 2001) and need fluent speakers to be successful.  When 
teachers are not fluent, fluent teaching assistants should be hired while teachers 
are increasing their own fluency and teaching basics like greetings.  Kipp (2000) 
writes that a fluent speaker, a resource person, is needed who will interact with 
the students on a normal, everyday basis thereby creating a 'Granma's house' 
atmosphere which will help take away the abnormality of learning what should be 
a mother tongue in an institution.  TFALC (2005) acknowledges this as well, 
writing that parents and Elders need to be active in the schools' language 
programs in order that children have an opportunity to speak outside of the 
school. 
  
Related to Grenoble and Whaley's (2006) criteria that there should be an 
assessment of how community members' view their own language, is Kipp's 
(2000) observation about the personal and painful struggle of relearning a mother 
tongue because of colonization and residential schools.  In Pitawanakwat (2009), 
Nelson Toulouse of Sagamok Anishnawbek and Alan Corbiere of M'chigeeng 
First Nation share similar views about language loss as well as the lack of 
intergenerational transmission being linked to the IRS system whereby it's "a 
whole mentality that just has to change, that hasn't changed because it is still 
going on.  And the people here that can speak Ojibwe for whatever reason they 
don't speak it to their children.  And that's one of the things that needs to be 
further investigated" (p. 155).  Lorena Fontaine recommends that there be 

 
 
102 
support groups for those who are still overcoming specific issues of historic 
trauma related to loss of language (Pitawanakwat, 2009, p. 189).   
 
It was also identified that the individual and the individuals within a 
community need to be responsible for the language's continuance.  The Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996d) writes that: 
 
"Conservation or revitalization of a language demands maintaining or 
 
restoring intergenerational language transmission. Since inter- 
 
generational transmission depends primarily on family and community  
 
networks, the focus of language conservation and revitalization efforts  
 
must shift from formal institutions to Aboriginal communities, families  
 
and social networks."(p. 40) 
TFALC (2005) also shares that while recording and writing the language are 
important, the focus needs to be on using the language daily. 
 
This is not to say that written resources cannot be of assistance.  Although 
Nishnaabemwin is an oral language, previous historians, linguists and even 
religious laymen as well as more contemporary Nishnaabemwin scholars and 
advocates have developed written resources available for Nishnaabemwin.  
Relying on older materials poses some difficulties, one being the ethnocentric 
nature of some of the material translated into Nishnaabemwin that was discussed 
earlier in Chapter Three.  Another difficulty with using older resources is the 
different orthographies as shown in Table 4.1.  These orthographies, some of 
which predate the International Phonetic Alphabet creation, reflect the diversity of 
sounds and pronunciation in Nishnaabemwin as well as the diversity of 

 
 
103 
orthographies for Nishnaabemwin.  This can be overwhelming for the novice 
Nishnaabemwin student.  It is very important, regardless of which orthography is 
used, to pay heed to the actual speech of fluent speakers (Jones, Jourdain & 
Tainter, 2011; Nichols & Nyholm, 1995).

4.2.1 Sagamok Anishnawbek's Language Maintenance and Revitalization 
 
The language statistics for Sagamok Anishnawbek in 2006 indicate that 
29.9% of the population spoke an Aboriginal language as a first language, 30.5%  
spoke an Aboriginal language at home while 41.8% had knowledge of an 
Aboriginal language (AANDC, 2014).  These numbers are slightly different than 
what was reported to Statistics Canada in 2001 when 31.6% spoke an Aboriginal 
language as a first language and 41.4% had knowledge of an Aboriginal 
language while the number of people who spoke an Aboriginal language at home 
was the same (AANDC, 2014).  In 2006 there are also slightly more males with 
Aboriginal language knowledge (450) than females (435).  These numbers 
represent an increase for males from (440) in 2001 and a stagnation for females 
(435) from 2001 (AANDC, 2014).  In 2011, Sagamok Anishnawbek was reported 
by Statistics Canada as having 31.1 % of its' population reporting an Aboriginal 
language as a mother tongue (Statistics Canada, 2013).  These numbers have 
stayed within a 2% range since 2001 (AANDC, 2014).  
 
Sagamok Anishnawbek is very active in Nishnaabemwin retention and 
revitalization and it has been well documented on a community level for quite 
awhile.  Toulouse (2001) reported that three decision-making bodies on 
Sagamok Anishnawbek- a Parent School Advisory Group; an Education 
Committee; and Elementary School Teachers- believed that Native language 
inclusion was very important for the children of Sagamok Anishnawbek despite a 
majority of the respondents declaring that they were not fluent (50% of teachers, 
75% of parent school advisory group; and 57% of education committee).  Some 

 
 
105 
of the reasons stated for the importance of Native language inclusion in the local 
school include: it is part of the Anishnawbek identity and without it the 
Anishnawbek are a dying nation.   
 
Pitiwanakwat (2009) interviewed Basil Johnston of the Chippewas of 
Nawash Unceded First Nation, who noted that Sagamok Anishnawbek "was an 
exceptional case due to the high number of speakers in that community 
compared to the dwindling numbers on most reserves in southern Ontario" (p. 
159).  In June of 2006 an optimistic community survey found that: 1) 100% of 
respondents felt the language was important to their everyday lives and their 
identity as an Anishnaabe; 2) 98% of respondents felt the language was 
important to achieving community wellness; 3)100 % agreed they would do 
whatever they could to share the language with community and 4)100% believe 
that language fluency was attainable (FWCDL, 2012, p. 1).  
 
Yet five years later, a less optimistic survey of 283 respondents found that: 
1) 62% rated their Anishnaabemowin speaking skills as "little"; 2) 64% rated their 
understanding of Anishnaabemowin as "little"; 3) 37% stated that "occasionally" 
Anishnaabemowin is spoken in their homes; 4) 29% stated that they are "too 
busy" to learn the language; and 5) 20% said the language is "too difficult to 
learn" (FWCDL, 2012, p. 1).  What was also identified by the community are the  
barriers to Nishnaabemwin revitalization such as: lack of real individual and 
community commitment to fluency; a changing value system; intergenerational 
transmission; mainstream media; wellness issues (past trauma, addictions, 

 
 
106 
identity and self-esteem); and focusing on either western or Anishnaabe ways or 
English or Ojibwe instruction instead of trying to balance them (FWCDL, 2012).  
 
Using the identified barriers as a tool to assist the community, the local 
school's immersion program continues and a strategic plan has been put in place 
in order to preserve the language.  It details a six part plan to do so: engage the 
community; restore school immersion programming; establish a Sagamok 
Language and Cultural Centre (Zagamok Wassegaankaan Teg); adult learning; 
training a new generation of language and cultural Promoters; and economic 
sustainability.  FWCDL (2012) identified that "the school needs visiting 
grandmothers or other fluent speakers.  We don't have enough fluent speakers 
who are engaged in passing the language on" (p. 5).  There were also 
community concerns that oral mastery of the language should be emphasized 
before the written aspect is taught to students as well as the fear that teaching 
and learning Nishnaabemwin in school will lessen English language skills. 
4.2.2 Participant Views on Language Loss and Language Revitalization 
 
Overall, the participants were aware of the issues surrounding language 
loss and language revitalization.  This may be due to the fact that their children 
and grandchildren are in the local school, Biidaabin Kinoomaagegamig, and its 
immersion program.  It may be due to a few members' exposure to post-
secondary Native language courses or it may be due to personal observations 
about themselves and their community.  The participants offered their own 
insights that echo earlier community reports and surveys such as FWCDL (2012), 

 
 
107 
Toulouse (2001), and Bopp & Lane, (2003).  Several key themes about language 
revitalization emerged:  
Figure 4.1 Participants' Nishnaabemwin Revitalization Recommendations 
 
∙Speak the language to the children and grandchildren (7 out of 11)  
 
∙Teach the language at school (5 out of 11).   
 
∙Adopt an Ojibwe language policy at all Band services (2 out of 11) 
 
∙Learn the language (2 out of 11)  
 
∙Utilize community speakers like Elders to help students learn (2 out 
of 11)  
 
 
 
These results clearly show that intergenerational transmission within the 
home and within the community is recognized as a paramount priority while the 
public school system is recognized as another viable domain for language 
revitalization.  One participant voiced concern that technology and interracial 
families will decrease "the significance of Native languages."  Another participant 
stated that "There are different ways we've tried.  We keep trying."  Other helpful 
suggestions included allowing for a choice of instruction (Ojibwe or English) and 
persistent communication in Nishnaabemwin despite attempts of others to speak 
English.  Perhaps one of the most inspiring was one participant's comment that 
"when someone knows the language, they never lose it.  It is inside of them." 

 
 
108 
 
It is equally important to find out what the current situation is in regards to 
language use in the home and in the community.  When asked if they speak 
Nishnaabemwin to their family, 9 participants responded with an affirmative.  Two 
participants gave a conditional yes: 1)"I try.  It's hard because everyone is so 
used to speaking English" and 2) "only if they can understand it." 
 
Table 4.2 illustrates the intergenerational transmission of each participant 
in the community.  Six out of the eleven participants, 54.5% indicated that they 
currently speak Nishnaabemwin to their children even if they are still teaching 
them or even if they only "understand some of it." Results are as follows: Group 1 
- 4 out of 5 participants (80%); Group 2 - 2 out of 6 (33%); Sub-group A - 2 out of 
3 (66%) while Sub-groups B and C were both 0%.  Notably, the participants who 
stated that they did not make conscious or sub-conscious choices to not speak 
Nishnaabemwin to their children (Sub-group C) did not identify their children as 
those they speak with.  Only three of the participants stated that they spoke to a 
spousal partner and they were all in Group 1.  This low number could be due to a 
few reasons: the spousal partner could be absent due to death or divorce or they 
could be non-fluent due to attendance in the IRS system or its' intergenerational 
effects or are non-Aboriginal.  
 
Six participants, 54.5%, also stated that they spoke Nishnaabemwin to 
their grandchildren, including two participants who did not initially speak it to their 
children.  Of these two participants, one had made a conscious choice to not 
speak Nishnaabemwin to her children because of her traumatic experiences in a 
day school, made another conscious choice to speak to her grown children years 

 
 
109 
later.  This shows resilience for this participant overcame the traumatic effect of 
the IRS system on her intergenerational transmission of Nishnaabemwin and 
began to teach two generations.  The results for this category are: Group 1 2/5 
(40%); Group 2 - 4/6 (66%); Sub-Group A - 2/3 (66%); Sub-group B - 0%; and 
Sub-group C - 2/2 (100%).  Sub-Group C's numbers are encouraging for 
although they did not speak to their children, they spoke to their grandchildren. 
 
For the eight participants who identified siblings that they spoke to the 
results are:  Group 1- 4 out of 5 or 80%; Group 2 - 4 out of 6 or 66%; Sub-group 
A - 2 out of 3 or 66%; Sub-group B -100%; and Sub-group C - 1 out of 2 or 50%.  
For the seven participants who said they spoke to extended family members 
including cousins, aunts, uncles, parents, grand- great uncles and great aunts, 
the results are: Group 1- 5 out of 5 (100%); Group 2- 2 out of 6 (33%); Sub-group 
A- 1 out of 3 (33%); B - 0%; and Sub-group C- 1 out of 2 (50%).  Lastly, six 
participants identified the larger community including 'my generation', 'other 
speakers ,' 'Elders,' 'my friends,' and 'bingo player,' as people they speak to.  The 
results for this category are: Group 1- 4 out of 5 (80%); Group 2- 2 out of 6 
(33%); Sub-Group A- 1 out of 3 (33%); Sub-group B- 0%; and Sub-group C- 1 out 
of 2 (50%). 
 
Overall, the data indicates that another generation will be speaking 
Nishnaabemwin either as a mother tongue or a second language basis.  The 
data also appears to indicate that there is a community of speakers to support 
another generation with domains outside of the home and school to support

language transmission (church, local Bingo hall and other general common 
areas).

CHAPTER FIVE: Impacts on Ojibwe Speech Patterns 
5.1 General Analysis of Participants' Responses to the Language 
Performance Assessment (Part I) 
 
Correctness is utilized in this discussion to mean the ability to provide an 
answer to the questions being asked and not whether there was a particular 
response.  As the following tables illustrate there were varied responses to the 
questions which will be analyzed later in the Chapter.  As detailed in Table 5.1., 
the data indicates the following: Group One had an average correctness of 24.4 
out of 30 questions or 81.3%; Group Two had an average correctness of 26.6 out 
of 30 questions or 88.9%; Sub-group B had an average correctness of 24 out of 
30 questions or 80%; Sub-group A had an average correctness of 26 out of 30 
questions or 86.7%; and Sub-group C had an average correctness of 30 out of 
30 questions or 100 %. 
 
Table 5.2 shows the comparison of Group One and Two which indicates 
that those who attended in the IRS system performed better on the language 
performance assessment by a margin of 7.6% than those who were not directly 
in the IRS system.  This corresponds to First Nations Centre (2005) wherein it 
was found that those who attended a residential school were more likely to 
understand a First Nations language compared to those who did not attend a 
residential school (74.8% vs. 43.6% respectively).  This is accounted for by two 
key factors: 1) the active defiance of Aboriginal students who spoke in secret to 
each other despite school policies against speaking an Aboriginal language and 
2) Aboriginal students who relearned their language later in life (pp. 38-39). 

 
 
112 
 
Group Two's average age upon entry into the IRS system was 7.75 or 
7.58 years of age (the average age for Sub-group A was 7.33 or 7.66, Sub-group

B was 7 and Sub-group C was 8.25).9 Clearly, BICS would have been 
established and this group of youth were already developing CALP, especially 
Sub-Group C. 
 
As illustrated in Table 5.3, within Group Two, the sub-group B and C data 
indicates a strong correlation between the length of time spent in the IRS, the 
ranking of the experience and the general performance on the language 
performance assessment.  The sole participant in Sub-Group B endured 10 years 
in the IRS system and only the residential school.  She ranked her experience 
with a two out of five, provided an equally negative description of her personal 
experience and that of others while her performance on the language 
performance assessment was the lowest for those who had attended an Indian 
Residential School.  Sub-group C that had the highest ranking of their IRS 
system experience, endured less time in the IRS system and also had a 
combined time in the residential school and day school that was still less than the 
participant who only attended a residential school.   
 
Table 5.1 illustrates each participant's score.  The results for Emma 
Meawasige (EM) are included in the tables although after the interview she 
stated that she had slowed her speech down in order for the researcher to write 
down the answers and that "when you say it normally, you don't catch all the  
sounds."10 This may be the reason there were variants in some of her answers.  
Another participant Irene Makadebin (IM) identified that she was deaf in one ear 
and this may also account for some of the divergent responses such as the use  
                                                           
9 The dual averages presented reflect the one participant's answer of 7 or 8 years. 
10 This was the first interview conducted and allowed the researcher to remind the other participants to use natural speech 
patterns.

of an interrogative form of a verb instead of the requested imperative form in 
Table 5.20. 
 
The average score for all of the participants was 25.8 or 86%.  This would 
suggest that this group of self-identified speakers of Nishnaabemwin have a fairly 
high level of fluency.  When the individual results are compared, the three highest 
scoring participants (with the highest scores possible of 30) were the oldest 
members of the group with ages of 84, 77 and 70 and their respective 
involvement in the IRS system was non-attendance and two with attendance at 
both the Indian Residential School and the Day School (Group 1 and Sub-group 
C).  It is significant that two of these participants attended a Native language 
certification program through Lakehead University as it can allow for an 
increased use of Nishnaabemwin which in turn could assist with familiarity of 
terms.  This will be discussed further in Chapter 6.  The individuals with the 
lowest scores (20, 20) were the youngest at ages 45 and 42 and were members 
of Group 1. 
 
The discrepancy between these two groups' correctness is 10 questions.  
This may be because the group that is older by approximately 25 to 40 years 
would have had more community and family members who spoke to them as well 
they would have heard Nishnaabemwin in more public domains like church, 
ceremonies, dances, games, visiting and general common areas.  The group that 
was younger would have more English language influences such as television, 
radio and social media, an English language public education, greater perceived 
economic necessity to speak English as well as a need to accommodate more 

 
 
117 
non-speakers in public domains which could affect their language usage and 
retention.  This difference in age groups' proficiency in Nishnaabemwin is similar 
to findings from Artuso (1998) on the Algonquian language and Goodfellow 
(2005) on the Kʷakʷk'wakʷ language which also reiterate the influence of 
colonialism and government education policy both past and current on 
Indigenous languages. 
 
It is important to consider what type of questions that the participants from 
Group 1 did not answer and Table 5.2 details this.  Overall, 13 questions out of 
30 were not answered.  This will be further discussed in the following sections. 
Overall, it appears that internal variation is primarily reflected in the participant's 
responses and with very minor exception, significant differences are not 
attributable to attendance at the IRS system.  It is important to remember that 
Nishnaabemwin, like any language, is subject to the fact that: 
"speakers make constant use of the many different possibilities 
offered to them.  No one speaks the same way all the time and 
people constantly exploit the nuances of the languages they speak 
for a wide variety of purposes.  The consequence is a kind of 
paradox: while many linguists would like to view any language as a 
homogeneous entity and each speaker of that language is 
controlling only a single style, so that they can make the strongest 
possible theoretical generalizations, in actual fact that language will 
exhibit considerable internal variation, and single-style speakers will 

 
 
118 
not be found (or, if found, will appear to be extremely 'abnormal' in 
that respect, if in no other!)" (Wardhaugh, 1998, p. 5)   
What is more important and which will be discussed in the next chapter, is what 
is affecting language? 
5.1.1 General Analysis of Participants' Responses to the Language 
Performance Assessment Narratives (Part I) 
 
 
As will be discussed in Chapter 6, there were limitations to the narrative 
analysis and a comprehensive linguistic analysis will not be made (Appendix G). 
Only general observations about the performance of the participants' narratives 
will be discussed.  Everyone with the exception of one participant who indicated 
that she was not emotionally able to continue, completed both narratives 
although another participant only completed a sentence for the second narrative.  
No particular reason was provided for this although the researcher sensed some 
discomfort, whether it was emotional trauma, nervousness or personal shyness 
that got the better of the participant.  For most participants, the first narrative was 
the easiest to complete.  This narrative called for a brief summary of all that 
transpired the morning of the interview.  Most were in the indicative mood.  The 
second narrative required the participants to recall a time in their life and relate 
that for the research project.  This second narrative often was longer and 
employed a greater degree of language proficiency in that the indicative and the 
subjunctive moods were utilized.   
 
Another observation about the participants' narratives was the use of code  
switching.  Code switching is "a conversational strategy used to establish, cross 
or destroy group boundaries; to create, evoke or change interpersonal relations 

 
 
119 
with their rights and obligations" (Gal, 188, p. 247 in Wardhaugh, 1998, p. 100) 
and people may choose to "switch from one code to another or to mix codes 
even within sometimes very short utterances and thereby create a new code" 
(Wardhaugh, 1998, p.100).  Within the group of participants, code switching was 
used the most by a participant from Sub-Group A.  The chart illustrates how 
many English words were used by each participant.  There were also English 
words that were nativized such as mii-etextwichke, doo-trailermin.

5.2  Linguistic Analysis 
 
The following linguistic analysis is only of the first 30 questions of Part I of 
the Research Questionnaire.  A discussion of lexical and semantic changes will 
be made first as this is the main area where change related to the IRS system 

 
 
121 
was detected.  This will be followed by a discussion of the phonological, syntactic 
and morphological changes respectively. 
 
To assist in the discussion of the linguistic analysis of Part 1, Figures 5.5 
and 5.6 list the standard sound system of Nishnaabemwin for vowels and 
consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet and the Double Vowel system.  
These are the two writing systems utilized in the following discussion.

5.2.1 Lexical and Semantic Change 
 
 
Semantics is the study of meaning in human language (O'Grady & 
Dobrovolsky, 1996, p. 233).  Lexicon loss is related to semantics whereby words 
in a person's mental 'dictionary' which have specific meaning are lost.  "Semantic 
broadening is the process in which the meaning of a word becomes more general 
or more inclusive than its historically earlier form" (O'Grady & Dobrovolosky, 
1996, p. 302).  An example of this is the English term "aunt" which originally 
meant "father's sister" and now means "father or mother's sister" (O'Grady & 
Dobrovolsky, 1996, p. 303).  One key change is loss of lexicon which appears to 
be the most significant change for the participants.  Table 5.2 shows that 13 
questions could not be answered by one or more participants and since nine of 
these questions were kinship terms, there is specific language loss of these 
terms.  Three of the other four terms (drum, drumming, and nursing) are 
classified as traditional cultural terms whose usage would have been decreased 
due to the legislative restrictions discussed in Chapter Two as well as non-
Aboriginal religious influences and conformity to Western modernization and 
social standards.  The lack of knowledge of these terms may also be attributable 
to the direct and indirect effect of the IRS system on these participants.  The final 
term not answered was "biitoosjigan" which had the most contextual variations 
for the term (pie, saucer, a lining, sandwich, footwear sole).  
 
Another key semantic change occurring amongst the participants is 
semantic broadening.  As illustrated in Table 5.3, semantic broadening appears 
to be occurring for the term "nimkiikaa" that two participants stated meant 
"lightning" or "thunder and lightning" as opposed to just "thunder" or "thundering."  

 
 
123 
Although there was some divergence in the features of [sound, light], all 
meanings shared the common features of: [+ weather terminology, +storm]. The 
two participants who provided these answers were attendees at Day School 
(Sub-group A) and at residential school (Sub-group B) and this shift can be co-
related to Group Two's attendance in the IRS system.  Notably, none of the 
participants stated that nimkiikaa referred to thunderbirds.  This may be due to 
the fact that this meaning has been lost or disregarded due to the ethnocentric 
beliefs enforced in the IRS system or due to underlying cultural mores that limit 
the utterance of the distinction.

Semantic broadening also appears to be occurring for the term binoojiin 
which is utilized for child.  The term, binoojiins, is used to represent a baby,  
however, as shown in Table 5.3, the terms binoojiin or binoojii were utilized to 
mean" baby" for five participants.  In Table 5.4, the term kaadensan was 
identified as meaning either "little legs" or "legs" with one participant qualifying 
the leg as human.  While it is quite possible that participants would have made a 
distinction between little legs and legs if they were both posed as questions, it 
also appears that kaadensan is undergoing semantic broadening.  Notably, none 
of the participants stated that kaadensan meant braids.  In the same Table the 
term biitoosjigan was identified as meaning "layers like a pie," "saucer," "a lining,"  
" something that, like you make a sandwich or a sole, an extra sole in it," or 
generally, "something that goes in between."  While this appears to be semantic  
broadening, it is not.  The underlying meaning "something that goes in between" 
is applicable for all of the answers provided and no specific context 
was provided for the term that would have narrowed the translation ie. pie, 
saucer etc.  For all aforementioned terms, however, the responses were evenly 
divided amongst Group 1 and Group 2 and any variations cannot be directly 
attributable to the IRS system.   
 
 The term for "my father" was divided between dedem and variants of 
noos as shown in Table 5.5.  In the same Table, the term for "my mother" was 
divided between the variations of the terms maamaa and ngashe.  There were no 
different terms for "my grandfather" and no different terms for "my grandmother" 
either although there was internal variation as shown in Table 5.6.

In Table 5.7 three terms were provided for "my aunt," nzigwas, nzhishen, 
and ziksis while one term zhishen was used for "my uncle."  As shown in Table 
5.8, there were three terms for "my older sister," misen, mjiikawis, and chi-shiime, 
while "my younger sister" yielded two terms with minor variation shiime and 
dashkwejigan.  Table 5.9 showed two terms with variation for "my older brother", 
niikaane and sayen while two terms emerged for "my younger brother," shiimen 
and egaachii'it niikaane.  In Table 5.10 for the term, "he is picking berries," only 
one divergence from the term miinke (AIV), was shown - demiinke (AIV) and 
three terms with variation for "nursing," doodooshke (AIV), nooni (VTA) and 
shamawsa (VTA) were shown.  Lastly, in Table 5.11, 7 participants used the AIV 
mang-shkiinzhigwe with some internal variation for big eyes while the PREV chi - 
was used to modify -shkiinzhigwe for four other participants ( 3 from Group 1 and 
1 from Sub-group C). 
  
Overall, these patterns are not significant for the purposes of the research 
project and cannot be directly attributable to attendance at the IRS as the 
variations occurred in all groups.  It is important to note though that colonialism 
and the imposition of a European family structure undermined Indigenous kinship 
and the terms used to describe them (Goodfellow, 2005) and " since the former 
relationships expressed by the indigenous kin terms will not be a part of their 
social reality, these kin terms will not be relevant ot the child's everyday 
experience in the family and community." (p. 28)

5.2.2 Syntactic Change - Word Order 
 
 
In Table 5.12 the 2p IMP form was used for all responses with the 
exception of one participant (WS) who used the 2p IND form.  Four different 
verbs were used (zhaa (AIV), oodetoo (AIV), giishnadaaswaa (TAV), 
baawetwanoo ) with zhaa being used the most by eight participants.  The word 
orders that appeared most frequently were VS (subject noted by 2p suffix -k on 
verb form) for 8 participants and SV (subject noted by identification of the 2p 
subjects Mary and David) for three participants who were from Group 1 and sub-
Groups C and B.  Eight participants used a NI LOC also referred to as a PREV 
that was either between 1) the S and V (one participant), 2) before the VS 
sequence (5 participants), or 3) after the VS sequence (2 participants).  
 
For the Table 5.13 phrase, "get out of here dog," four participants did not 
use a verb and only locational AVs (gojiing, gaji,goji, maa, ma, man pii, maam pii 
and combinations of AVs), two used the VAI zhaa in the 2s IMP form as indicated 
by the -n suffix, and 5 participants used a variation of awis/awas which is noted 
as being an uninflectable particle (Nichols & Nyholm, 1995).  The word order VS 
appeared for the two participants using the VAI zhaa in the 2s IMP form.  In 
Table 5.I4 for the phrase, "I see a boat, " one VTI, waamdaan with variation, was 
used for all responses and it was in the 1s IND form.  The same NI, jiimaan, was 
used by all participants as well.  The word orders that appeared were OSV for 
eight participants and SVO for three participants who were from Group 1 and 
sub-Groups A and C.  In Table 5.14 "I see a dog" phrase, one VTA, waabmaa 
with variation, was used by all participants and was in the 1s IND

In Table 5.15 "go to town David", the VAI zhaa in the 2s IMP form as 
indicated by the suffix -n was used by 3 participants ( Group 1 and sub-Groups C

2s IND form and 1 in the 2s interrogative form using the AV for yes/no questions 
na.  The two word orders that appeared were VS for 5 participants and SV for 4 
participants.  In Table 5.15, "How are you?" all participants used the AV na, along 
with an interrogative pronoun.  One participant used na with a subjunctive verb 
form and interrrogative pronoun.

5.2.3 Phonological Change 
 
 
Phonology is the study of the sound patterns in a language.  Tables 5.16 
and 5.17 indicate that there is phonological variation in the following verb forms: 
1) [gij∙wɛ] and [gij∙ɛ]; 2) [gij∙wɛ∙da] and [gij∙ɛ∙da]; and 3) [dɛ∙wɛ∙gɛ], [dej∙ow∙gɛ], 
and [dɛ∙ɛ∙gɛ].  For the first set, the ultima utilized an onset [w] or not.  In the 
second set, the penultima utilized an onset [w] or not while in the third set, the 
penultima utilized an onset [w] or not.  The third set also showed a variation in 
the nucleus of the penultima, [ow] or [ɛ] as well as variation in the nucleus of the 
initial syllable, [ɛ] or [ej].  Table 5.17 further illustrates individual phonological 
variation for participant #01's data: [dɛ∙wɛ∙gʌn] and [dɛ∙ɛ∙gɛ] where the penultima 
utilizes an onset [w] for one term but not the other.  All verb forms were the same 
in all categories as was the noun form. 
 
Table 5.18 illustrates the phonological variation for the terms Sagamok 
and Wikwemkong.  Both [s] and [z] were used for the former term in the onset of 
the initial syllable while [æ] and [ʌ] were both used as the nucleus of the initial 
syllable.  For the term Wikwemkong,[ɪ] and [ij] were both used as the nucleus in 
the initial syllable.   
 
As shown in Tables 5.16, 5.17 and 5.18, the phonological patterns of the 
participants appears to be internal variation until supporting data can attribute it 
to other factors. The data sampling from the research project was inconclusive in 
regard to phonological change causation attributable to the IRS system.  As will 
be discussed in Chapter Six, there are other factors to consider, such as spelling 
pronunciation, that may be occurring.

5.2.4 Morphological Change 
 
Morphology is the study of word formation and interpretation and usually is 
divided into two main areas: derivational and inflectional morphology.  
Nishnaabemwin is described as a polysynthetic language "characterized by 
morphologically complex words whose component morphemes often express 
meanings that would be expressed by a separate word in a European language" 
(O'Grady & Dobrovolsky, 1996, p. 381).  
 
Loss of affix is a morphological change whereby an affix is no longer used.  
In Tables 5.19, morphological patterns emerged with regard to the inflectional 
possessive affixes.  Three participants (01, CNK and 05) did not use possessive 
prefixes or suffixes for the term "my baby" while 8 participants used variants of 
these.  Of the three participants, participant 05 actually stated "her baby." There 
also appears to be the loss of the diminutive affix - iins as shown in Table 5.19 as 
well as loss of recognition of the diminutive suffix for kaadensan in Table 5.4 .  
 
Suppletion, a morphological process whereby a completely different 
morpheme replaces the existing morpheme in order to indicate a grammatical 
contrast appears to exist as shown in Table 5.19.  In Table 5.19 some 
participants used one term for "baby" then used a different term for "my baby."  
This change appears to show possession with or without possessive markers 
(affixes) in the new term.  
 
The aforementioned data was inconclusive in regard to morphological 
change as a result of effects of the IRS system for the changes occurred in all 

 
 
139 
groups.  The possible suppletion noted in Table 5.19 was very close to being 
limited to one group (Group 1), however, one participant was from Group 2.

CHAPTER SIX: Conclusions and Recommendations 
6.1 Final Conclusions   
 
There are four key findings from the research project.  First, there is a 
strong co-relation between a lower language performance assessment, a longer 
length of time spent in the IRS system and a negative rating of the IRS system 
experience.  Secondly, there is a decline of Nishnaabemwin intergenerational 
transmission as indicated by members from both Groups 1 and 2 who 
consciously and sub-consciously chose to not speak to their children although 
those who made a conscious decision were in the IRS system (day school and 
residential school attendance only).  Thirdly, the day school experience was 
ranked more negatively than the residential schol experience; and fourthly, that 
racism, ethnocentrism and negative stereotyping as aspects of historical trauma 
were experienced by all of the research participants and that these factors can 
affect Nishnaabemwin language usage just as the IRS system could.  Overall, 
the historic trauma suffered by the research participants, the direct and indirect 
impacts of the IRS system as well as ongoing racism, ethnocentrism and 
negative stereotyping, was eventually overcome through their natural resilience 
that may or may not have been attributable in part to traditional healing 
methodologies.   
 
The research also revealed that those who attended both a residential 
school and a day school, Sub-group C, had the highest scores on the language 
performance assessment and gave the highest ratings for their IRS experience.   

 
 
141 
This finding is similar to Ohmagari & Berkes (1997) for intergenerational 
transmission of traditional bush skills and the First Nations Centre (2005a) study 
that indicates those who attended a residential school were more likely to 
understand a First Nations language compared to those who did not attend a 
residential school (74.8% vs. 43.6%) as discussed earlier in this Chapter and in 
Chapter Two.  In addition to the advanced age of the group's two participants 
when they entered the IRS system, an average of 8.25 years that ensured that 
their Nishnaabemwin language skills were intact, this group had family 
encouragement to attend the IRS system in order to economically benefit and 
also to help their own people understand what the "white man" was doing.  Both 
participants were also firm believers in the strength of Nishnaabek culture with 
one participant completing a four year Native Language Teacher Program at 
Lakehead University.  Both participants were also aware of the loss of mother 
tongue fluency through the IRS system for many IRS system students as well as 
the negative IRS system experiences suffered by others. 
6.1.1 Limitations 
 
The main limitation identified by the researcher was that there was no 
identified group who lost then regained mother tongue fluency as a result of 
attendance at the IRS system.  There could be a few reasons for this occurrence.  
The most obvious would be that this group is non-existent in the community, 
either there were no IRS system attendees who lost their language and then 
regained it or there were no IRS system attendees who did not lose their mother 
tongue and did not need to relearn it.  A second reason for the lack of this group 

 
 
142 
could be embarrassment that individuals feel at having lost their language at 
some point, an experience so shameful that individuals do not want to come 
forward to share their stories (FWCDL, 2012).11  Lastly, speakers may not be 
aware that they left the IRS system with a deficient linguistic competency for their 
age as there were little to no adult individuals at the residential schools to speak 
with or speakers may not remember what their language proficiency was when 
they left the IRS system.   
 
Another limitation was the structuring of the last two questions of the 
language performance assessment.  Individual expression was allowed for which 
made it difficult to compare the individual responses.  A sentence by sentence 
rendering of a common text would have elicited a more in depth linguistic 
analysis.  Participants were also not asked to repeat the narratives like they were 
for the first 30 questions and if they chose not to hear what they said, it was not 
played back for them.  As a result, some participants did not self-correct or alter 
their samples.  The time constraints of the research program did not allow for a 
full syntactic analysis of the data gathered in the narratives.  Other limitations 
with the research project were that more people were not involved and there was 
not enough time to accommodate more participants.  The research project is like 
a snapshot of the community, not the documentary that is needed to fully 
understand the intergenerational transmission of Nishnaabemwin occurring 
among Sagamok Anishnawbek members. 
                                                           
11 The researcher, in her capacity as a Nishnaabemwin Circle coordinator and Nishnaabemwin instructor 
based in Regina, Saskatchewan, has met other persons, some designated as Elders or traditional 
spiritualists who expressed similar embarrassment and discomfort for not speaking their mother tongue. 

 
 
143 
 
Overall, in regard to the Ojibwe speech patterns of the research project 
participants, it is fair to share Artuso's (1998) observation on the outcome of his 
field study that "few conclusions can be drawn from such a preliminary sampling 
of data."  Fortunately, this allows for the development of future research as will 
be discussed in the following sections.   
6.2 Recommendations 
 
Based on the findings of the research project, the following four key areas 
have been identified as areas where further research would be useful to 
understanding the sociolinguistic dynamics of language shift, language retention 
and language revitalization.   
6.2.1Language Program and Language Teacher Education Program 
Development 
 
 
The TRC made 4 key recommendations for language (TRC, 2015b): 
 
13. We call upon the federal government to acknowledge that Aboriginal 
 
rights  include Aboriginal language rights. 
 
14. We call upon the federal government to enact an Aboriginal 
 
Languages Act that incorporates the following principles: 
 
i. Aboriginal languages are a fundamental and valued element of 
 
Canadian culture and society, and there is an urgency to preserve them. 
 
ii. Aboriginal language rights are reinforced by the Treaties. 
 
iii. The federal government has a responsibility to provide sufficient funds 
 
for Aboriginal-language revitalization and preservation. 

 
 
144 
 
iv. The preservation, revitalization, and strengthening of Aboriginal 
 
languages and cultures are best managed by Aboriginal people and 
 
communities. 
 
v. Funding for Aboriginal language initiatives must reflect the diversity of 
 
Aboriginal languages. 
 
15. We call upon the federal government to appoint, in consultation with 
 
Aboriginal groups, an Aboriginal Languages Commissioner. The 
 
commissioner should help promote Aboriginal languages and report on the 
 
adequacy of federal funding of Aboriginal-languages initiatives. 
 
16. We call upon post-secondary institutions to create university and 
 
college degree and diploma programs in Aboriginal languages. (p.2) 
 
While the TRC recommendations are excellent, it is important to 
acknowledge that the magnitude of language change and the impacts of historic 
trauma transmission, in particular that of the IRS system and ongoing oppression 
are two areas that are understudied, however, the understanding of each of 
these factors is crucial in the fight for language revitalization.  The writer's 
research provides more focus, insight and detail of how language has changed 
as a result of the IRS system and other possible sociolinguistic factors that will be 
discussed in the following sections and can therefore guide language teachers, 
language teacher educators, language programs, school boards and First 
Nations, in their efforts to revitalize Indigenous languages.  Some considerations 
would be to provide for the historic trauma aspect associated with the IRS 
system.  This can mean making this a key component in language teacher 

 
 
145 
education programs as well as the language programs themselves.  It can also 
mean providing for the availability of traditional and contemporary counselling 
services for those who may find the acknowledgement of the impact of the 
historic trauma created by the IRS system and ongoing oppression difficult.  A 
cultural safety component that would increase understanding and respect of 
traditional Nishnaabek culture and language would be another useful component 
to these same programs. 
6.2.2 Lateral Violence 
 
Lateral violence is described as a cycle of abuse wherein the acts of a 
group who are oppressed by intergenerational and ongoing historical trauma, 
and who, instead of fighting against the oppressor, turn their anger, frustration, 
hatred and pain upon each other.  The symptoms of this cycle of abuse include 
belittling, ridiculing, excluding, jealousy, gossiping, backstabbing, undermining 
authority and in some instances acts of physical violence.  Lateral violence is 
recognized as affecting many organizations, communities and individuals.   
 
Brock Pitawanakwat (2009) touches on this issue although he refers to it 
as the "denigration" of others' Anishnaabemwin revitalization efforts.  Several of 
his research participants shared their experiences of 'denigration'.  Howard 
Webkamigad commented that "So here's people like that, you know, like to put 
people down I guess.  We get a lot of that."(p. 164)  Barb Nolan also shared that 
"Sometimes we have individuals who have a lot of negativity, wherever it's 
coming from...we have to sort of not listen to the negatives and the negativity 
people because they must be going through something on their own to make 

 
 
146 
them the way they are"(p. 165).  Pitawanakwat notes that "negative feedback 
from family and community members can obviously be a source of 
discouragement for learners."   
 
Sagamok Anishnawbek members are aware of the political and social 
pressures of lateral violence.  In 2003, a community history project revealed the 
following: 1) some people suggest they are afraid to speak out for fear of political, 
economic or other types of retaliation; 2) for many, trust is an issue, for in the 
past, people who have spoken out have been attacked, criticized and ridiculed 
and therefore gossip is a powerful barrier to participation; 3) jealousy towards 
those who serve in the community; 4) community divisions between geographical 
areas, religious traditions, political factions and certain family groups made 
getting involved in community affairs unpleasant; and 5) some people feel 
labelled or stigmatized because of something that happened in the past (Bopp & 
Lane, 2003, pp. 48-49). 
 
For the current research project, a few issues were noticed.  More than 
half of the participants chose a pseudonym or would not disclose their full legal 
names.  While only two of the participants expressed very real concern about 
community backlash, those same concerns could have also been a reason for 
the other four participants' decision to remain unknown.  One participant also 
shared that "if you are too outspoken, your own First Nation will tell you that you 
are too outspoken.  They will try to silence you, tell you to quiet down.  But there 
is freedom of speech.  I may get a lot of backlash."  Lastly, the researcher herself 
found that her status as an off-reserve or urban member created minor concern 

 
 
147 
for her as she was warned by another Band member that people would be 
unfriendly or unreceptive to the research project because she was not living on 
the reserve and that receiving funding for her educational program made her a 
target for an 'angry mob.'  Although in the researcher's situation, she was able to 
resolve the issues, it is a sad 'political' reality and an example of the lateral 
violence that affects many communities, First Nation or not.  Underfunding of 
Band services and aspects of historic trauma can worsen the situation and it is 
one that researchers should be aware of when wanting to work with First Nations.   
 
The possibility of lateral violence affecting Nishnaabemwin speech 
patterns was noted in the researcher's paper, "The Diminutive, the Pejorative and 
the Contemptive" which examined the three forms as analyzed in Valentine 
(2001).  An informal comparative analysis was made with the Sagamok 
Anishnawbek dialect.  The comparative analysis focused on: 1) dialect 
divergence from the diminutive variation paradigm; 2) lexical change in diminutive 
form; 3) animacy shift in the diminutive form; and 4) the convergence of the 
contemptive and the pejorative. 
 
With specific reference to the discussion on the convergence of the 
perjorative and the contemptive forms, it was revealed that at times the 
community history and tensions of the day could allow for the alteration of speech 
patterns.  In particular, the informant's father's use of the contemptive form was 
heard by the informant a few times in her childhood and now was not 
recognizable in her everyday speech.12  An explanation for this was provided by 
the informant.  The informant's father was originally from Manitoulin Island before 
                                                           
12 Mary Ann Owl, Sagamok Anishnawbek 

 
 
148 
he moved his family to Sagamok Anishnawbek and he would have had a similar 
dialect as Valentine's referent for some of the contemptive usage.  However, in 
efforts to co-exist more easily, it is highly possible that the informant's father 
ceased using the contemptive form and adopted the dialect variations in 
Sagamok Anishnawbek.  Overall, it is just one area that warrants deeper 
consideration in the form of further research. 
 
Lateral violence may be a growing issue in many First Nations 
communities for various reasons: a lack of funded positions and programs 
whereby dialect becomes a means to exclude people from said positions; 
economic incentive to use a particular dialect such as using your boss' or a 
politically powerful figure's dialect; implementation of a writing system that does 
not recognize pre-existing writing systems in place; and lack of inclusion of all 
Native people in the development and implementation of the new system.  As 
well, as communities begin to recover from historic trauma there may be greater 
pressure for people to speak their own language as a sign of anti-colonialist 
behaviour.  In the haste to do so, this could adversely lead to the ridicule of 
people who do not speak the same dialect or even the same style or word 
choice.   
 
With knowledge of the impact of lateral violence, language teachers might 
adapt teaching styles to include more community members' internal variation as 
well as dialect differences or include fluent speakers during a school community 
language event such as storytelling.  Further, it illustrates how intergenerational 

 
 
149 
trauma and other aspects of colonialism are problems to resolve in order to assist 
in language retention and language revitalization. 
6.2.3 Standardization 
 
Standardization is used to refer to the process by which an oral language 
becomes a written one and a corresponding orthography is developed or 
implemented to represent the language.  Some key benefits of standardization 
are uniformity and consistency of spelling along with documentation of languages 
that are in need of preservation (Hinton & Hale, 2001; Grenoble & Whaley, 
2006). Despite some of the benefits of standardization, there are also 
implications that need to be considered such as 1) the development of a belief 
that there are right and wrong forms of the language when pre-literacy native 
speakers usually have fewer fixed notions of correctness before a language is 
written, 2) loss of linguistic diversity, 3) restriction of internal variation and 
subsequent loss of natural change, 4) social stratification can occur when people 
don't speak or use the dialect in favour (Grenoble & Whaley, 2006, pp. 154-156). 
Shaul (2014) adds to this concept of social stratification by arguing that 
standardization can reduce "the language's context to a single domain, that of 
public display of the language's cultural capital and/or increase the language's 
commodification (by licensing who is qualified to write the standard language 
and/or teach the language)" (p. 14). 
 
In relation to the fourth item mentioned above, Wardhaugh (1998) writes  
that: 
 
 "Diglossia is a widespread phenomenon in the world, well attested  
 
in both space (e.g., varieties of Tamil in the south of India) and time  

 
 
150 
 
(e.g., Latin in Europe in the Middle Ages).  According to Ferguson  
 
(1959, p.338) it is likely to come into being when (1) 'there is a sizable 
 
body of literature in a language closely related to (or even identical  
 
with) the natural language of the community...[and when (2)] literacy  
 
in the community is limited to a small elite, [and]...a suitable period of 
 
 time, of the order of several centuries, passes from the establishment  
 
of (1) and (2).' People living in a diglossic community do not usually  
 
regard diglossia as a 'problem.'  It becomes a problem only when there  
 
is a growth of literacy, or when there is a desire to decrease regional  
 
and social barriers, or when a need is seen for a unified 'national' 
 
language." (p. 90) 
 
Wardhaugh also warns that diglossia reinforces social distinctions and 
maintains social hierarchy.  As a diglossic situation evolves, written literacy 
becomes seen as high, prestigious and academic while oral literacy is perceived 
as low, common and without prestige.  Other criteria are that the two varieties be 
sufficiently different from each other so that, "without schooling, the elevated 
variety cannot be understood by speakers of the vernacular" (Wardhaugh, 1998, 
p. 93) as well as the recognition that children learn a language while they are 
taught the higher form (p. 89).  When Nishnaabemwin is categorized as a 
language that has been understudied this infers that there is much more to know 
about the language and as noted in Chapter One, reliance on outdated resources 
suggests that standardization could create more division amongst Anishnaabek.  
As well, it was noted in Shaul (2014) that official language models that promote 

 
 
151 
standardization are "imposing the linguistic ideology of the dominant, English-
speaking culture on Aboriginal communities" (p. 6). 
 
Some language advocates like Valentine do not think that standardization 
is an issue writing that "some socially prestigious dialect is chosen to be the 
standard, since that dialect is likely to reflect the speech of politically, 
economically, and educationally prominent members of society.  The standard 
then gets promoted by use in educational institutions that train local teachers, 
and certification of teachers may involve tests showing proficiency in the 
standard.  While such an approach may seem unfair to local interests, it has 
much to commend it" (Valentine, 2001, p. 31).  Valentine (2001) argues that 
standardization is helpful for development of common identity and 'nationhood,' 
there is better access to current resources using the standard forms as well as 
the development of new ones; and there is greater understanding across dialects 
and regions.  In regard to the latter mentioned, there is already a certain level of 
higher understanding of dialect differences as related by John D. Owl to his son 
Raymond S. Owl, and that a person could tell where someone was from by how 
he or she spoke Nishnaabemwin and that it was all still mutually understandable 
(Raymond S. Owl, personal communication, 2013). 
 
Standardization appears to also be an issue in other areas as indicated by 
Jones, Jourdain & Tainter, (2011): 
"All participants agree that the writing system is not the critical focus 
 of instruction, but rather the spoken word.  The writing system is 
just a tool"(p.8).  It should be noted too that in the aforementioned 

 
 
152 
project, the "participants were very careful to include all entries no 
matter how divergent the dialects were so that all speakers had 
voice.  There was no attempt to standardize the language." (p. 6) 
 
In the case of Sagamok Anishnawbek, the "standardization of how words 
are spelled" was identified as an issue for Sagamok Anishnawbek in 2012 
(FWCDL, 2012).  It may be that the orthographies being used are not reflecting  
all of the naturally occurring internal variation of speakers.  Nishnaabemwin 
written materials are provided to the students at the local school and some 
parents will be assisting their children or using these materials to acquire written 
literacy as was the case for four of the research participants.  Some speakers 
might conform to this written standard or feel discouraged by the lack of inclusion  
of their internal variation or dialect forms. In turn, the students at the school may 
hear this disconnect between what is written and what is actually being sllopoken 
by fluent speakers in the community with the end result being discouraged from 
learning Nishnaabemwin.  This is a similar situation for some Arabic students 
who feel that either Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic are not 
representative of their actual speech patterns (Haeri, 2000).  In the case of the 
Arabic language however, the Qu'ran is the principal means by which Classical 
Arabic is taught and it was codified in 633 AD by a fellow native speaker.  It's 
important to note that while the Arabic language evolved over 1382 years, 
Nishnaabemwin has a much shorter history (two hundred years) of being written 
and this was primarily done by European lay scholars and academics.   

 
 
153 
 
This is not to say that standardized Nishnaabemwin resources cannot be 
helpful for language revitalization.  Rather, teachers need to utilize teaching 
methods that understand the limits of standardization as well as the role of 
internal variation in a community of speakers.  This may not be happening.13  
Two participants in the research project shared that they completed a four year 
university program and attained literacy skills in Nishnaabemwin in order to teach 
it.  They also shared their views about teaching Nishnaabemwin: "When you 
teach, it helps them get the sounds, to slow it down" and that " It's better to just 
give them the real words, just talk the language."  These two comments raise the 
question as to whether efforts are made to introduce normal speech patterns or 
whether teachers are being instructed to emphasize only one correct form based 
on what is in standardized written materials.   
6.2.4 Spelling Pronunciation 
 
Spelling pronunciation is a source of language change whereby a new 
pronunciation arises that reflects more closely the spelling of a word, e.g., often 
pronounced as [aftɘn] rather than [afɘn] (O'Grady & Dobrovolsky, 1996).  This is 
related to standardization for as standards are set without fully understanding or 
documenting the complexity of Nishnaabemwin, we stand to lose a wealth of 
knowledge about Nishnaabemwin as well as alter the speech patterns of fluent 
speakers who are keepers of Nishnaabemwin. 
                                                           
13Where once the researcher would have heard language teachers talk about how local variations should 
be heeded and that the pronunciation of fluent speakers should be followed, the researcher now hears 
that the written form takes precedence over the oral forms and fluent speakers are 'corrected' to better 
reflect the standardized form. 

 
 
154 
 
Determining to what extent standardization and spelling pronunciation has 
affected and is still affecting Nishnaabemwin speech patterns is clearly an area 
that needs to be further researched.  There is a need to bring the community 
together, to bridge the gap in intergenerational transmission of Nishnaabemwin.  
There is a need to ensure that the richness of internal and dialect variation is 
reflected in the orthography.  It is important to remember that " your language 
choices are part of the social identity you claim for yourself" (Wardhaugh, 1998, 
p.95).  When an individual chooses to use the term "biibii" which is often seen as 
an English word that has been "nativized," they are choosing that word based on 
personal preferences and it reflects who and what is important to them.  Asking 
or demanding someone alter a speech pattern that has personal and family 
history in order to simplify Nishnaabemwin is to ignore the very personal and 
cultural histories of the individuals within a community.  It is akin to asking people 
to change their denomination in the name of standardizing Christianity.   
 
In this crucial time of language life or death, what is needed is to embrace 
the dialect and personal differences, record them, write them down, speak them, 
adapt orthographies if needed, develop effective teaching models for students, 
language teachers and language teacher educators, and thereby keep the 
linguistic history of Nishnaabemwin alive for future generations.  To do this, is to 
honour and respect our Elders, our traditional knowledge keepers, our ancestors 
and those yet unborn.  This will help heal our people.

PARTICIPANT CONSENT FORM 
 
Project Title:  The Effects of the Intergenerationl Residential School Experience and Negative 
Racial Stereotyping on Ojibwe Speech Patterns in mid-Northern Ontario Anishnawbek 
 
Researcher: Natalie Owl, Graduate Student, Department of Interdisciplinary Studies, Faculty of 
Graduate Studies and Research, University of Regina, 306-545-5990, 306-502-0491, 
owlnat11@uregina.ca. 
 
Supervisor: Professor Arok Wolvengrey, Department of Linguistics, First Nations University of 
Canada, 306-790-5950 ext.3310, awolvengrey@fnuniv.ca. 
 
Purposes(s) and Objective(s) of the Research:  
The historic trauma of the Indian Residential School system and its intergenerational effects 
have taken a  toll on the Aboriginal community.  As well ,the negative racial stereotypes that 
allowed for the Indian Residential School system continue to plague the Aboriginal community.  
In particular, fewer people speak a  First Nations languages from birth and fewer people are 
fluent speakers. 
To help understand how and why  the Ojibwe language is changing, this project will specifically 
examine possible linguistic changes in the morphology, syntax and semantics of Ojibwe.  If it is 
found that there is little change within the groups, language educators could duplicate the 
means by which the first group retained their mother tongue.  Overall, there is great potential 
for advances in language retention and revitalization. 
The objective of this project is to determine to what extent the impact of the Indian Residential 
School system and negative racial stereotyping has had on the Ojibwe language within the mid-
northern communities surrounding Sagamok Anishnawbek. 
 
Procedures: 
This study will involve interviews with three groups: 1)speakers who attended residential school 
and who lost and later regained their fluency; 2)speakers whose parent(s) attended residential 
school; and 3)speakers who did not attend or had minimal attendance at residential school and 
who never lost their fluency.  Approximately twelve participants are expected and ideally four 
for each category.  A questionnaire will be used in individual interviews that will be audio-
recorded.  A debriefing session will take place when the interview is over.  The location will be 
mutually agreed upon.  The session should be approximately one hour.   
 
Potential Risks: 
There are foreseeable risks related to this study as it deals with memories and experiences of 
the Indian Residential School system.  Specifically, the risks may include social harms such as 
breach of confidentiality if anonymity is waived, through the recruitment process  and due to 
the context of research,  social stigmatization, threats to reputation, economic repercussions, 
damage to relationships and/or psychological harms such as anxiety, regret or guilt feelings.  The 

 
 
191 
potential for these risks occurring may increase if you allow use of your name when you may be 
quoted in the final report.  In order to manage these risks, I arranged for a debriefing session 
after the interview.  As well, I prepared a list of community resources that the participant may 
use if so desired.  I am trained to  
intervene in crisis situations and have an extensive background dealing with vulnerable peoples 
although I am not a counsellor. 
As a reminder, this study is voluntary and participants should only answer those questions that 
they are comfortable answering.  Your answers will be kept confidential, however, under certain 
circumstances such as planning to self-harm or harm others or if you have harmed others, I am 
legally required to report this to authorities.  Under such circumstances, I would end the 
participant's involvement in the study. 
 
Potential Benefits: 
While there are no guarantees, it is highly likely that the study will be beneficial to the 
participants, to the community of Sagamok Anishnawbek, to other First Nations language 
programs, to the non-Aboriginal community and to the  general state of knowledge. 
There is the potential for Indian Residential School survivors to  express their concerns about the 
loss or decrease in fluency in their mother tongue and if needed, access counselling services that 
may assist them in a healing journey.  This may be an opportunity that they have never had 
before.   
There exists the potential for the community of Sagamok Anishnawbek to have access to 
information about its Indian Residential School survivors, their concerns, the current state of 
Ojibwe language fluency, retention and revitalization and to assist other First Nations 
communities with the results from the study. 
There exists the potential for other First Nations language programs to access information about 
the community of Sagamok Anishnawbek and its issues of language fluency, retention and 
revitalization.  There would then be a greater likelihood of adopting similar community efforts. 
There is the potential  for the non-Aboriginal community to learn from the study's results 
especially in the area of negative racial stereotyping and the impact of the Indian Residential 
School system.  With this knowledge, it is far easier to help end racism so that the dangers of 
history repeating itself are gone. 
Lastly, there exists the potential to increase the general state of knowledge about the 
sociolinguistics of Ojibwe in the mid-Northern Ontario region and create a better understanding 
of the effects of negative racial stereotyping and the Indian Residential School system on the 
Ojibwe language.   
 
Confidentiality: 
Participation in this study is voluntary and the participant is free to withdraw at any time.  If the 
participant chooses to withdraw, his/her data will be deleted from the research project and 
destroyed, if so desired. 
The data from this research project will be published and presented at conferences; however, 
your identity will be kept confidential.  Although we will report direct quotations from the

*It was this way.  I was born and raised here in Sagamok.  I went to school in 
Sagamok.  There used to be two schools.  When we were in school we couldn't 

 
 
226 
speak our language, Ojibwe.  If we spoke our language and the teacher caught 
us she gave us a strap.  They taught us how to answer when we went to Church.  
It used to be in Latin so we would go to Church every Sunday (I forgot to say we 
had to go to Church every Sunday.  The next day was Monday and the teacher 
would ask us what the sermon was about).   
My mom and my brother they went to Spanish.  They went to the Indian 
residential school.  I was mostly talking about Stan.  One year he was there.  Out 
of that year he only went to school one month.  For some reason one of the 
priests didn't like him and would hit him with a fist.  When it was my time to go, I 
decided I wouldn't go just for that reason, what my brother said.  Father 
O'Flaherty was mad at me because I wouldn't go.  So that was the end of it.

Once when I was a girl, me and my sister were afraid.  It was summer and it was 
thundering and raining hard.  My great-grandmother was scared too.  She said 
the Devil was close by.  There was lightning.  She sprinkled holy water.  She 
prayed and sang  Ava Maria.  Me and my sister sat so still on the couch.  I saw a 
shadow of  someone's stomach.  We thought it was the Devil.  We were more 
afraid.  Then I heard a knock on the door.  The old lady said  "Someone open the 
door and see who is that over there"  We thought that the devil was talking to us.  
Then the old lady went over there behind the door.  She opened the door.  It was 
Elias there.  "I am on my way home but it is raining too hard. "  "Come in" said 
the old lady.  Soon enough the old lady was hurrying around making tea.

We slept in a tent.  We made a fire.  He made a fire outside.  My mom cooked.

She made skaan.  She boiled potatoes in jackets, she didn't peel them.  Just 
before the potatoes cooked,  she put the fish  on top of the potatoes.  They made 
tea.  Sometimes they cooked berries and some they sold.  We felt good.  I miss 
that way of life.  I miss my parents.  We did well with the way we lived.  We saw 
all kinds of animals, seagulls too, all kinds of things.  Sometimes,  people came 
with us, uncles, aunties, friends.  I would like to have that type of meal again that 
was cooked outside.  It was good.  That's enough.

*When I was a young boy I used to live with my mom and dad.  Every day I used 
to go to school.  I went to school at the yellow hall somewhere in the Roman 
Catholic church area.  So the task was to go to school, walk to school.  And it 
didn't matter what it was like outside, it might of been raining, it might of been 
snowing, it might of been cold but still all went to school.  It appeared everybody 
was going to school probably walking just like myself.  And there were lots of 

 
 
231 
people going to school in that area.  To the best of my recollection, I didn't mind 
going to school.  I thought it was nice.

we had to help with the garden.  When I was about 9 years old my parents took 
me to, told me I had to go school in Shingwaak.  So I went to school there for 6 
years.  It was pretty good there cuz we were able to learn plus you could play 
different type of games, learn how to play different type of games.  After that I 
was there for six years.  I quit when I was 15.  From there I had to start working.

*My uncle gave me a dog, one of those collie dogs.  My dad trained it as a sleigh 
dog.  We used to live in Spragge and my grandma, my mother's mother used to 
live in Cutler. you know just way at the end, about four or five miles from 
Spragge.  We used to walk to go and visit.  They used to go on the railroad track 
and we would go on the ice with the dog.  There was two girls, five boys.  We 
were the smallest.  It was just Romeo, Wendy, Selena, and me, Peter and Joe.   
Five of us would get on the sleigh.  The dog would take us to my grandma's.  We 
didn't have to walk.  They used to steal my dog.  My brothers did.  My brother 
Peter, he's dead now,  told me about that not too long ago.  They used to 
harness up my dog and take him.  It was a good dog.  My dad felt sorry for that 
dog.  We used to live on this side of the track and the zhaaganaashak on the 
other side.  He used to go over there.  One night he got trampled by the train.  My 
dad would start yelling for him.  So we went and seen him on the track.  We 
buried him.  He was an old dog.  Wherever we went he was there.  He was a 
good dog.

 When I was small, my uncle gave me a dog.  My deceased dad harnessed the 
dog to pull the sleigh.  So then we went to go visit my grandmother where she 
lived.  There was four of us that got on that sleigh.  We started to drive away in 
the sleigh pulled by my dog to go visit over there.  My parents walked on the train 
tracks so they could go visit over there.  Once my brothers, my two brothers, 
used to steal my dog so they could go for a sleigh ride.  My dog was very good.  
One night, he got hit.  The train hit the dog.  That was the end of having a dog.  
My deceased dad was very sad.  He really regretted that the dog died, the dog 
was such a good working dog.
