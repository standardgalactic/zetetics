Introduction 
 
Jurisdictions have long recognized the benefit of pooling resources in the development 
and maintenance of apprenticeship training standards.  A successful example of this is 
the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program itself.  Essential to the establishment of 
standards is the development of suitable training systems and programs which enable 
tradespeople to acquire certification based on these standards.  While certification is the 
responsibility of Apprenticeship administrators throughout Canada, the development 
and delivery of technical training is the responsibility of jurisdictions. 
 
In 1999, work to develop common training for apprenticeship programs within the 
Atlantic Provinces began.  To date, 22 Curriculum Standards have been developed 
through the Atlantic Standards Partnership (ASP) project to assist programming staff and 
instructors in the design and delivery of technical training.  Similarly, the Canadian 
Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA) embarked on a process for the 
development of national Interprovincial Program Guides (IPGs) for the Boilermaker, 
Carpenter and Sprinkler System Installer trades.  At its January 2005 strategic planning 
session, the CCDA identified developing common training standards as one of key 
activities in moving towards a more cohesive apprenticeship system. 
 
With the support of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), several 
provinces and territories have partnered to build on the ASP and the CCDA processes to 
further develop IPGs to be used across the country.  This partnership will create 
efficiencies in time and resources and promote consistency in training and apprentice 
mobility.

User Guide 
 
According to the Canadian Apprenticeship Forum, the IPG is: "a list of validated technical 
training outcomes, based upon those sub-tasks identified as common core in the National 
Occupational Analysis (NOA), and validated by industry in the provinces and territories 
as incorporating the essential tasks, knowledge and skills associated with a given trade." 
 
Learning outcomes contained in the IPG represent the minimum common core content 
for the development of jurisdictional training standards and outlines.  IPGs are 
developed based on the NOAs and extensive industry consultation.  The IPG is intended 
to assist program development staff in the design of jurisdictional plans of training.  Each 
jurisdiction has the flexibility to add additional content. 
 
The IPG was deliberately constructed for ease of use and flexibility of structure in order 
to adapt to all delivery requirements.  It details units of training, unit outcomes and 
objectives.  It does not impose a delivery model or teaching format. 
 
Jurisdictions and/or training providers will select and develop delivery materials and 
techniques that accommodate a variety of learning styles and delivery patterns.  The IPG 
does not dictate study materials, textbooks or learning activities to be used in delivery. 
 
The IPG document includes a recommended leveling structure to facilitate mobility for 
apprentices moving from one jurisdiction to another.  Because of difference in 
jurisdictional regulations and program durations, levels are offered as suggestions only. 
 
Structure 
 
The IPG is divided into units.  The unit codes are used as a means of identification and 
are not intended to convey the order of delivery.  Prerequisites have not been detailed.  
Each unit consists of Learning Outcomes and Objectives and Content. 
 
The Learning Outcomes are the specific performances that must be evaluated.  Wording of 
the learning outcomes, "Demonstrate knowledge of…", acknowledges the broad 
spectrum of ways in which knowledge can be shown.  It is at the discretion of each 
jurisdiction to determine the manner in which learning outcomes are evaluated; 
theoretically, practically or a combination of both. 

6 
User Guide (continued) 
 
The Objectives and Content for the unit details the information to be covered in order to 
achieve the performances specified in the Learning Outcomes.  These objectives can be 
either theoretical or practical in nature, based on the requirements identified through the 
industry consultation process.  The learning activities used to cover the objectives are at 
the discretion of the jurisdiction; however, practically worded objective statements have 
been used where industry indicated a need for the apprentices to receive exposure to 
performing the task or skill outlined while attending technical training.  For example, this 
exposure could be done through instructor demonstration or individual or group 
performance of the skill or task. This practical training will help to reinforce the 
theoretical component of the technical training.   
 
Detailed content for each objective has not been developed.  Where detail is required for 
clarity, content has been provided.  The content listed within the IPG document is not 
intended to represent an inclusive list; rather, it is included to illustrate the intended 
direction for the objective.  Content may be added or extended in jurisdictional training 
plans as required. 
 
Jurisdictions are free to deliver the IPG units one at a time or concurrently, provided that 
all Learning Outcomes are met.  The IPG does not indicate the amount of time to be spent 
on a particular unit as the length of time required to deliver the Learning Outcomes 
successfully will depend upon the learning activities and teaching methods used.

Essential Skills Profiles 
 
Essential Skills are the skills needed for work, learning and life.  They provide the 
foundation for learning all the other skills that enable people to evolve within their jobs 
and adapt to workplace change. 
 
Over the past several years, the Government of Canada has conducted research 
examining the skills people use at work.  From this research, Essential Skills Profiles have 
been developed for various occupations.
