Stern–Gerlach Experiment
( Wigner distribution), which is a representation of the state operator that is in-
termediate between the position and momentum representations, and bears a partial
similarity to a classical phase space distribution.

State Operator
The most general representation of a quantum state. See the articles States, Pure
and Mixed, and their Representations and States in Quantum Mechanics. The terms
 statistical operator and  density matrix are also used.
Statistical Operator
An alternative term for the  state operator, used mainly in quantum statistical
mechanics.
Stern–Gerlach Experiment
Friedel Weinert
The Stern–Gerlach experiments (SG experiments) were prepared and carried out by
Otto Stern (1888–1969) and his junior collaborator Walther Gerlach (1889–1979)
between 1921 and 1925. [1–6] According to modern textbook interpretations the
experiments established experimentally the so-called  quantization of angular mo-
mentum and therefore the discreteness of the magnetic moment of atomic particles
 Spin; Vector model. This phenomenon is known as ‘space quantization’ (Rich-
tungsquantelung) of angular momentum. As indicated below, the actual historical
