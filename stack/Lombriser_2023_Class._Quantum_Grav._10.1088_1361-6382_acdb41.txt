Abstract
Theoretical and observational challenges to standard cosmology such as the cosmological
constant problem and tensions between cosmological model parameters inferred from different
observations motivate the development and search of new physics. A less radical approach to
venturing beyond the standard model is the simple mathematical reformulation of our theoret-
ical frameworks underlying it. While leaving physical measurements unaffected, this can offer a
reinterpretation and even solutions of these problems. In this spirit, metric transformations are
performed here that cast our Universe into different geometries. Of particular interest thereby
is the formulation of cosmology in Minkowski space. Rather than an expansion of space, spatial
curvature, and small-scale inhomogeneities and anisotropies, this frame exhibits a variation of
mass, length and time scales across spacetime. Alternatively, this may be interpreted as an
evolution of fundamental constants. As applications of this reframed cosmological picture, the
naturalness of the cosmological constant is reinspected and promising candidates of geometric
origin are explored for dark matter, dark energy, inflation and baryogenesis. An immediate ob-
servation thereby is the apparent absence of the cosmological constant problem in the Minkowski
frame. The formalism is also applied to identify new observable signatures of conformal inho-
mogeneities, which have been proposed as simultaneous solution of the observational tensions
in the Hubble constant, the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and the gravitational lensing am-
plitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. These are found to enhance redshifts to
distant galaxy clusters and introduce a mass bias with cluster masses inferred from gravitational
lensing exceeding those inferred kinematically or dynamically.

Introduction
Its capacity to reproduce the wealth of cosmological observations conducted over the past few
decades has cemented ΛCDM as the standard model of cosmology. Despite this resounding
observational success, significant gaps persist in our theoretical understanding of some of its
key ingredients. The cosmological constant problem [1, 2], the nature of dark matter [3] and
inflation [4, 5], or the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry [6, 7] in the Universe consti-
tute particularly important and profound enigmas among them. The cosmological constant
is generally thought to be attributed to the gravitational contribution of vacuum fluctuations,
anticipated of adequate magnitude to account for the observed late-time accelerated expansion
of the Universe. Quantum theoretical estimates so far, however, exceed measurement by sev-
eral orders of magnitude. Moreover, the comparable size of its associated energy density with
that of matter today provokes a further conundrum, the Why Now? or coincidence problem.
The energy density of matter in itself poses a deep physical puzzle. It is dominated by an
elusive dark matter that despite its overwhelming indirect observational evidence has so far
evaded direct detection. The remaining baryonic part, although known in nature, comes with
a larger abundance of baryons than antibaryons. The associated baryogenesis process causing
this asymmetry has not been identified yet. Neither has the precise physical mechanism for an
inflationary epoch in the early Universe been determined.
Besides these theoretical shortcomings, a number of unexplained larger and smaller obser-
vational tensions have manifested between the cosmological model parameters inferred from
our different data sets. The most prominent among them is the ∼5σ tension in the current
cosmic expansion rate H0 as measured with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and with
the local distance ladder [8]. Another ∼3σ discrepancy is observed in the current amplitude
of large-scale matter density fluctuations σ8 (or S8) as inferred from the CMB and as mea-
sured with large-scale structure surveys [9]. For another example, a discrepancy of ≲3σ also
manifests in the imprint of weak gravitational lensing on the CMB spectra, which is larger
than what would be expected from the cosmological parameters obtained from early-time CMB
physics [10]. Interestingly, the preferred enhancement ATT
L
> 1 of the lensing amplitude is not
observed in the power spectrum of the reconstructed lensing potential, Aϕϕ
L = 1, which may be
perceived as another indicator of an underlying inconsistency.
Both these theoretical and observational challenges have prompted for the development and
search of new physics [11, 12]. In contrast, a less radical approach to venturing beyond the
Standard Model of Particle Physics and ΛCDM is the simple mathematical reformulation of
our theoretical frameworks underlying them. This can offer new perspectives with different
physical interpretations and possibly even provide solutions for these theoretical and observa-
tional problems.
This article explores the implications of casting cosmology into different spacetime geometries
as a simple mathematical manipulation that leaves physical measurements unaffected but can
reveal new physical insights. Clearly, the Minkowski spacetime occupies a special place among
the metrics one can transform the cosmic geometry into, being static and flat as well as the
spacetime of special relativity and quantum field theory or indeed of the entire Standard Model.
Hence, a particular focus is put on casting cosmology into Minkowski space. Besides rederiving

the Friedmann equations, the evolution of energy densities, and redshift, the formalism is also
employed to gain new perspectives on the cosmological constant problem, dark matter, dark
energy, inflation, baryogenesis, and a range of observational cosmic tensions.
The article is organised as follows. Sec. 2 discusses the general interchangeability of gravita-
tional theory, the energy-momentum sector and spacetime geometry in the Einstein field equa-
tions. Conformal metric transformations and the dimensional reduction of warped spacetimes
are briefly reviewed and applied to the Einstein-Hilbert action and the Einstein field equations.
In Sec. 3 these transformations are employed to cast cosmology into static and Minkowski space
for smooth backgrounds with and without spatial curvature as well as for scalar and tensor per-
turbations. The Friedmann equations, the evolution of energy densities, and redshift are derived
for the transformed spacetimes. Conformal transformations are then applied in Sec. 4 to cast the
cosmic spacetime into Einstein-de Sitter and de Sitter backgrounds as well as for the treatment
of nonlinear conformal inhomogeneities. Sec. 5 is devoted to applications of the formalism. It
discusses the naturalness of the cosmological constant in the Minkowski frame, conformal inho-
mogeneities as solution to tensions between cosmological observations, and promising candidates
for dark matter, inflation and baryogenesis. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. 6.

Gravity in different casks
Before delving into the geometric transformations of cosmological spacetime, the resulting
change of physical equations and its implications for their physical interpretation and our under-
standing of the Universe and the physical processes taking place within it, a brief presentation
of the relevant theoretical background shall be given here. Sec. 2.1 introduces, as a general con-
cept, the interchangeability of gravitational theory, the energy-momentum sector and spacetime
geometry in the Einstein field equations. Sec. 2.2 discusses the metric transformations and de-
composition that will be used to recast the Einstein-Hilbert action and Einstein field equations
into different geometries. Readers familiar with Riemannian geometry may want to skip this
section. Sec. 2.3 derives the Einstein-Hilbert action and the field equations under a conformal
transformation of the metric, which will be used in Sec. 3. These discussions are intended to
be compact but sufficient to equip the unfamiliar reader with the necessary tools for immersing
into the subsequent sections.
2.1
Interchanging energy-momentum, gravity and geometry
Let us begin with some general considerations on the relationship between gravitational theory,
energy-momentum and geometry in the Einstein field equations, Gµν = κ2Tµν, where κ2 ≡
8πGc−4 denotes the gravitational coupling and the metric signature (−, +, +, +) will be adopted
throughout the article. Suppose the gravitational theory is modified, and the energy-momentum
tensor Tµν relates to a modified tensor Mµν rather than to the Einstein tensor Gµν such that
Mµν = κ2Tµν .

This relation can always be recast as the usual Einstein field equation with the definition of an
effective energy-momentum tensor,
Gµν = κ2Tµν + κ2T eff
µν ,
T eff
µν
≡κ−2Gµν −κ−2Mµν ,
(2)
where covariant conservation of Tµν and the Bianchi identities imply covariant conservation of
T eff
µν . This ambiguity between modifications in the metric and matter sectors has also been
coined the dark degeneracy in Refs. [13,14].
We shall now add another layer of degeneracy, stemming from the choice of geometry. Let
us assume the metric ˆgµν satisfies
ˆGµν = κ2 ˆTµν
(3)
for some specified matter content in ˆTµν. The field equations can now be recast into a different
geometry ˜gµν = Aαβ
µνˆgαβ + Bµν as
˜Gµν = κ2 ˜T eff
µν ,
˜T eff
µν (˜g) ≡

κ−2 ˜Gµν −κ−2 ˆGµν + ˆTµν

(˜g) .

This is merely a mathematical manipulation, simply a substitution of the variable one is solving
the differential equations in Eq. (3) for.
Just as with any other differential equation, one
may always perform such a change of variable, in this case the metric. The physics remains
unchanged. Note, however, that freely falling particles in ˆTµν(˜g) no longer follow geodesics for
˜gαβ, which manifests as an additional interaction and breaks a degeneracy for visible matter
species between the two frames set by the two different metrics. In contrast, an interacting
dark sector is simply receiving additional interactions.
Alternatively to Eq. (4), one could
also define modified geometric and matter sectors such as ˜
Mµν ≡ˆGµν(˜g) and ˜T eff
µν
≡ˆTµν(˜g)
in ˜
Mµν(˜g) = κ2 ˜T eff
µν (˜g) or other terms that are Eq. (3) in disguise. A consequence of these
reframed field equations is that one may cast the physics of a system into a spacetime geometry
of choice. The implications of that for our physical interpretation and understanding of the
observed Universe will be the main subject of this article.
Note that the transformation between the Jordan and Einstein frames of modified gravity
models is related to Eq. (4).
Hereby, a metric transformation is applied to recast the field
equations Mµν(g) = Tµν(g) in Jordan frame into Einstein frame with ˜Gµν(˜g) = ˜T eff
µν (˜g), where
˜T eff
µν (˜g) contains Tµν(˜g) and contributions from Mµν(˜g). Thereby, Mµν(g) and Tµν(g) as well
as ˜Gµν(˜g) and ˜T eff
µν (˜g) are covariantly conserved whereas Mµν(˜g) and Tµν(˜g) are not.
Finally, one may also impose a specific matter content and invert Eq. (1). For that, assume
the following field equations hold for gµν,
Gµν = κ2T (1)
µν .
(5)
One can now enforce a different matter content T (2)
µν (g) such that
Mµν = κ2T (2)
µν ,
Mµν(g) ≡

Gµν + κ2T (2)
µν −κ2T (1)

observations and rather interpret them as some effective components attributed to an underlying
modification of gravity. Eq. (6) implies that one can in principle construct such a modified
gravity model which will be phenomenologically equivalent to ΛCDM. It can be obtained from
including dark matter and/or dark energy in T (1)
µν but not in T (2)
µν . The intricate part is to find
T (2)
µν as a function of gµν so that the procedure is universal, and when adopting a different metric
than gµν to describe some other gravitating system, the predicted phenomenology of this new
system remains invariant, or at least it should remain compatible with the measurements of
that. Of course, for the model to be falsifiable, one would hope that this invariance is broken
in some systems.
Instead of specifying the matter content in Eq. (6), one could enforce a specific modified
tensor Mµν and adapt the energy-momentum tensor accordingly. One may also specify the
matter content and the metric and construct the tensor Mµν valid for that. Generally, one can
specify any two components between (modified) Einstein tensor, energy-momentum tensor and
metric by adaption of the third.
The form of the tensors on either side of the field equation (1) is thus not a useful discrim-
inator for the classification between dark sector, interacting dark sector and modified gravity
models. Instead, the distinction can be drawn upon whether the matter species of a theory
satisfy the strong and weak equivalence principles [15]. The dark sector in Einstein’s Theory of
General Relativity satisfies both the weak and strong equivalence principles whereas interacting
dark sector models break both. Modified gravity models satisfy the weak equivalence principle
as a metric can be found, typically the Jordan frame, to which all matter species couple univer-
sally and along which they freely fall whereas they break the strong equivalence principle since
this circumstance depends on a body’s composition. It is not necessary, and arguably not more
natural, to cast the gravitational theory in the (Jordan) frame where (some) matter species
couple minimally to the metric, and physical equations and interpretations may sometimes be
more practical in Einstein frame. The same applies for the geometric transformations in Eq. (4).
2.2
Transformations and decomposition of the metric
To recast the Einstein-Hilbert action and the Einstein field equations into different geometries,
particularly into Minkowski spacetime, the metric decomposition will be performed employing
combinations of conformal transformations and dimensional reduction. For completeness, the
details of these transformations shall be provided here.
Readers familiar with Riemannian
geometry may want to skip this section.

The Einstein tensor Gµν = Rµν −1
2Rgµν (+ Λgµν) transforms accordingly.
For the dimensional reduction, consider a warped spacetime metric in N = n+m dimensions,
gµν(xξ)dxµdxν = ˜gij(xk)dxidxj + F 2(xk)ˆgAB(xC)dxAdxB ,
(10)
where Greek indices run over n + m dimensions, lowercase Roman letters over m = dim( ˜

dimensions and capital Roman letters over n = dim( ˆ

The conformal transformations (7) and (9) will be applied to the Einstein-Hilbert action
in Sec. 2.3. The application of the dimensional reduction of gµν and R to the action can be
conducted analogously to Ref. [16] and shall not be performed explicitly here (see, however,
Secs. 3.2–3.4 for an implementation in the matter sector).
2.3
Conformally reframed Einstein field equations
For a concrete example of how the Einstein-Hilbert action and the Einstein field equations trans-
form under the metric modifications of Sec. 2.2, consider the general conformal transformation
˜gµν = Ω2(τ, x)gµν of the (3 + 1)-dimensional metric gµν(τ, x). The Einstein-Hilbert action for
gµν reads
S =

2κ2
Z
d4x√−g (R −2Λ) +
Z
d4x√−gLm(gµν, Ψm) ,
(13)
where Lm is the Lagrangian density of the matter fields Ψm. Under the conformal transformation
this becomes

Sm[Ω−2˜gµν, Ψm] =

−˜gΩ−4Lm(Ω−2˜gµν, Ψm) .
(15)
Note that the matter fields are no longer minimally coupled to the metric (see Sec. 2.1).

The action (16) and field equations (18) resemble those of a scalar-tensor modification of
gravity, where conformal transformations are used to convert between the Einstein and Jordan
frames. Note, however, that for scalar-tensor theories, these frames interchange minimal and
non-minimal couplings to the tensor field between the metric and matter sectors whereas the
conformal transformation from Eq. (13) to (16) introduces a non-minimal coupling in both
sectors, initially not coupled to ψ. We shall thus refrain here from using the terminology of
Einstein and Jordan frames to avoid confusion.
Varying the action (16) with respect to ψ yields the field equation

Casting cosmology into Minkowski space
Our Universe is well described by a perturbed expanding spatially homogeneous and isotropic
spacetime metric. The metric hereby is the solution of the Einstein field equations. Just as with
any other differential equation, one can always make a substitution of the variable, in this case
the metric, one solves the equation for. This is merely a mathematical manipulation and does not
make any changes of the underlying physics (see Sec. 2). But by performing transformations of
the metric, one can ask whether a more useful metric, or variable, can be found by substitution
that simplifies the equations or allows for some insightful physical interpretation. A special
place among the spacetimes one could transform the cosmic geometry into is occupied by the
Minkowski metric, being static and flat as well as the spacetime of special relativity and quantum
field theory or indeed the entire Standard Model. It is thus worthwhile studying cosmology in
the Minkowski frame.
With the metric transformations discussed in Sec. 2, we shall hence
proceed with casting cosmology into Minkowski space (see Sec. 4 for other choices).
In Sec. 3.1, the expanding spatially homogeneous and isotropic spacetime of the cosmic
background is first cast into a static spacetime by conformal transformation. The Friedmann
equations, the evolution of energy densities, and redshift are rederived in this static frame.
Sec. 3.2 then employs the combination of conformal transformations and dimensional reduction
of the metric to further cast the static spacetime into Minkowski space in the presence of
spatial curvature. The transformations are then generalised to cast inhomogeneities from cosmic

structure into Minkowski spacetime in Sec. 3.2.
Finally, an extension of this procedure to
gravitational waves is briefly discussed in Sec. 3.4.
3.1
Cosmology in static spacetime
The (3+1)-dimensional spatially homogeneous and isotropic expanding cosmological background
is described by the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) line element
ds2 = −c2dt2 + a(t)2dx2 ,
(21)
where t denotes cosmic time, a(t) is the scale factor and dx2 = (1−kr2)−1dr2+r2(dθ2+sin2 θdϕ2)
with spatial curvature k. Cast in conformal time τ, Eq. (21) becomes
ds2 = a2(τ)

−c2dτ 2 + dx2
,
(22)
where dτ = a−1dt. Hence, a2(τ) acts as a conformal factor in Eq. (22).
For simplicity briefly assuming the absence of spatial curvature (k = 0), the metric gµν for
ds2 = gµνdxµdxν in Eq. (22) becomes
gµν = a2(τ)ηµν ,
(23)
where ηµν = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) is the Minkowski metric. Thus, gµν is a conformal metric trans-
formation of Minkowski spacetime with conformal factor a2(τ). The inverse conformal trans-
formation ηµν = a−2(τ)gµν can then be used to cast the Einstein-Hilbert action into Minkowski
space. One may set ˜gµν = ηµν, ψ = a, and ˜R = 0 in Eq. (16) to arrive at

−κ2
6 Sm[ψ2ηµν, Ψm]
(24)
with V (ψ) = −Λψ4/6.
It is worthwhile noting that action (24) also holds for k ̸= 0, in which case, however, ψ
becomes both time and space dependent. This is due to the FLRW metric generally being
conformally flat with vanishing Weyl tensor, and so gµν = a2(T, R)ηµν with k ̸= 0 for suitable
coordinate choices T and R [17–20]. Sec. 3.2 will present a different approach to recovering the
gravitational action and field equations in Minkowski space for scenarios with k ̸= 0.
Consider now the conformal transformation (7) of the metric gµν defined by the line ele-
ment (21), allowing k ̸= 0, with ψ = Ω−1 = a(τ) such that ˜gµν is static.
Importantly, as
highlighted in Sec. 2.1, given that this is merely a mathematical transformation, observed phys-
ical relations should remain unaffected by the transformation. Indeed, as shown in the following,
despite the static cosmological spacetime, the Friedmann equations and the evolution of energy
densities (Sec. 3.1.1) as well as redshift of distant emissions (Sec. 3.1.2) are recovered.

Using Eqs. (7) and (21) with ψ = Ω−1 = a(τ), one finds ˜R00 = 0, ˜Rij = 2k˜gij and ˜R = 6k from
Eqs. (11) and (12). Hence, for the 00 component in Eq. (18), one obtains

with equation of state w = ρc2/p. Eqs. (31) and (32) provide evolution equations for the energy
densities that are consistent between both frames such that the Friedmann equations and the
evolution of the scale factor with cosmic time t remain invariant under the transformation.
Note that in the frame of ˜gµν, the radiation energy density ˜ρr is constant whereas the energy
density associated with the cosmological constant ˜ρΛ scales as a4 and that of matter ˜ρm as
a.
Importantly, the relation of particle masses to the CMB radiation temperature remains
invariant between the two frames due to the evolving masses in the Minkowski frame (see
Sec. 3.1.2), and particles become non-relativistic at the same time. Likewise, the relation of
emitted photon energies to temperature remains invariant. Finally, it is also worthwhile noting
that the evolution of ψ = a and the evolution of the energy densities can be recovered without
the Einstein field equations and thus the metric variation of action (16), only using Eqs. (19)
and (20).

3.1.2
Redshift
Importantly, as shown in the following, despite the static geometry of the Universe in Sec. 3.1.1,
cosmological observations are still redshifted. However, rather than due to the expanding space,
redshift is caused here by evolving particle masses [21,22] (also see Ref. [23]). Thus, a photon
emitted in the past as the result of some atomic line transition will be redshifted with respect
to the measured emission of the same transition in our local, present laboratories. Photons still
follow null geodesics in the conformally transformed frame [22] and our detectors measure them
at their emission frequencies.
To illustrate the evolution of masses, consider a matter field with the simple Lagrangian

and
˜□Ψm −(mc/ℏ)2ψ2Ψm = 0 ,
(35)
where one may define the evolving mass ˜m ≡mψ in this frame. This evolution of ˜m is also
more generally found for spinor fields interacting with a vector field in curved spacetime [21,22]
and has important implications for our observations.
Consider for example the transition lines from an ni state to an nf state of a hydrogen atom,
for which one finds

(36)
The redshift ˜z is given by the ratio between the energy emitted from this transition as observed
in the laboratory ˜Eninf and the frequency observed from this transition occurring at a distant
galaxy ˜ωo. One finds
1 + ˜z =
˜Eninf (O)

˜Eninf (S)
ℏ˜ωo

˜Eninf (S)

(37)
using that the photon frequency does not change with its propagation through Minkowski space,
˜ωo = ˜ωs. Inversely, one has

˜Eninf (S)
ℏ˜ωs

(38)
This implies that redshift is invariant between the two frames, as expected for an observable
quantity, and is determined by the ratio between the generally spacetime dependent ψ(τ, x)
evaluated at source and observer.
Specifically, for the spatially homogeneous and isotropic case, ψs = a(tem) = a and ψo =

a = 1 + z .
(39)
Note that redshift is also recovered for gravitational wave emissions, which is also attributed
to the evolution of masses [22], where massless gravitons, like photons, still follow null geodesics
in the conformally transformed frame.
3.2
Spatial curvature
As pointed out in Sec. 3.1, spatially curved FLRW metrics have vanishing Weyl tensor and
are thus conformally flat.
They can therefore be written as gµν = a2(T, R)ηµν for suitable
coordinate choices T and R [17–20]. In principle, one could thus directly apply the conformally
reframed Einstein field equations of Sec. 2.3. Another procedure to transform the gravitational
action and field equations into Minkowski space is to perform a combination of dimensional
reduction and conformal transformations.
Specifically, the static line element obtained after the conformal transformation in Sec. 3.1.1
is given by
d˜s2 = ˜gµνdxµdxν
=
−c2dτ 2 +
dr2
1 −kr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2)

dζ2 + ζ2(dθ2 + sin2 θ) dϕ2
,
(42)
where hyperspherical coordinates are adopted in the second line and the coordinate change
dχ = [r(ζ)/ζ] dζ is performed in the third. Note that for k = 0, r(χ) = χ and hence dζ = dχ.
To now cast the Einstein-Hilbert action (16) for ˜gµν and ψ = a with k ̸= 0 into Minkowski
space, one can apply Eq. (10) to perform the dimensional reduction of ˜R to separate out the
spatial Ricci scalar ˜R(3) in the action and subsequently perform a conformal transformation of
˜R(3) with ˆg(3)
ij = [r(ζ)/ζ]−2˜g(3)
ij = η(3)
ij .
The procedure shall not be carried out for the metric sector here. Of interest is rather the
transformation of the matter sector. Revisiting the toy matter Lagrangian (34), one finds in
Minkowski space with Cartesian coordinates the scalar field equation

ℓ= ℓp.

3.3
Cosmic structure
Our Universe is of course not perfectly spatially homogeneous and isotropic, and cosmological
metric perturbations are typically not conformal (see Secs. 4.3 and 5.2 for conformal pertur-
bations). But performing an analogous procedure to that of Sec. 3.2, one may also recast the
Einstein-Hilbert action for the perturbed Cosmos into Minkowski space.
For that, consider the metric gµν defined by the line element
ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = a2(τ)
h
−c2e2α(τ,x)dτ 2 + e2β(τ,x)dx2i
,
(45)
which for α ≡Ψ, |α| ≪1 and β ≡Φ, |β| ≪1 becomes the usual linearly perturbed FLRW line
element in conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge and conformal time,
ds2 = a2(τ)

−c2(1 + 2Ψ(τ, x))dτ 2 + (1 + 2Φ(τ, x))dx2
.
(46)
For the following discussion, the perturbations may not need to be linear, however.
Note
that dx2 may not be flat (k ̸= 0), in which case a factor r(ζ)/ζ from Eq. (44) can first be
absorbed into eβ. Next, one can apply the conformal transformation ˜gµν = a−2(τ)e−2α(τ,x)gµν,
then perform the dimensional reduction to ˜R(3) and the conformal transformation of that with
ˆg(3)
ij = e2(α−β)˜g(3)
ij = η(3)
ij
such that the Einstein-Hilbert action is recast into Minkowski space.
We shall again refrain from computing the resulting metric sector for this frame and instead
focus on the scalar field equation for Ψm. The transformations yield

in Cartesian coordinates, where γ ≡β−α. Hence, one encounters a variation of time ι, length ℓ,
and mass scales m for the field Ψm in Minkowski space. Note that one could also recast Eq. (48)
as a varying speed of light c(xµ) and/or a varying Planck constant ℏ(xµ). Similarly, one would
interpret the variation of ℓ2(xµ)c3(xµ)/ℏ(xµ) = G(xµ) as a variation of Newton’s gravitational
constant.
Importantly, the same metric transformations performed on the metric part of the action
(and on the other matter fields) will leave physics invariant. Predictions for observable quantities
will remain the same, but interpretations may change such as for the redshift in Sec. 3.1.2. For
a loose analogy, consider the observed angular positions of planets in the sky, whose predicted
motions are unaffected by whether we adopt a heliocentric view or an exact transformation of
that into geocentric coordinates. The heliocentric system provides a much simpler and universal
physical picture than the resulting epicycles, but one would not adopt heliocentric coordinates
to describe a small-scale experiment in a laboratory on Earth. Similarly, the FLRW metric may
not be optimal for describing small-scale physical processes in our nonlinear Universe, and a
change of mathematical frame may become more suitable (see Sec. 5).

It is worthwhile noting that if not performing the analogous transformations in the metric
sector, or only performing them in the metric but not in the matter sector, one does modify
physics. For instance, if not applying the conformal transformation for the matter sector in
Eq. (16), one recovers a scalar-tensor modification of gravity. One may furthermore consider
non-universal couplings of different matter species to this conformal factor, thereby breaking the
weak equivalence principle [15] (see Sec. 2.1). This multitude of possibilities motivates generally
testing, across the vast spacetime, for phenomenological variations in the effective time, length
and mass scales of the observed behaviour of different matter species as in Eq. (48), or likewise
in the fundamental couplings.
Note in this context that while the Minkowskian picture is
physically equivalent to the standard cosmological picture both at the classical and quantum
level [24] and observationally indistinguishable from it, it offers a different basis for theoretical
extensions. These may appear more natural in one picture over the other and if verified, could
favour one framework over the other.
3.4
Gravitational waves
Finally, consider the symmetric traceless tensor perturbation hij of dx2 in Eq. (45). This term
will remain in ˆg(3)
ij
after the transformations of Secs. 3.2 and 3.3. To then cast the Einstein-
Hilbert action into Minkowski space, one may perform a metric transformation of the form ˆg(3)
ij =
A kl
ij η(3)
kl +Bij. With suitable transformations and coordinates, this amounts to simply separating
out the tensor field hij in addition to the scalar fields from the three and four-dimensional
conformal transformations.
One can see from Eq. (48) that this will lead to oscillations in
time and length scales. Since gravitational waves are not studied further in this article, a more
detailed calculation is left to future work.

Casting cosmology into other backgrounds
The transformations of Sec. 2 have been used in Sec. 3 to cast cosmology into static spacetime
and then further into Minkowski space. The target cosmological background may however not
need to be Minkowski space. For illustration, in Sec. 4.1, our Universe is cast into Einstein-de
Sitter spacetime, which will provide room for a reinterpretation of dark energy. In Sec. 4.2, it is
cast into a de Sitter background, which will allow for a reinterpretation of dark matter. Sec. 4.3
then casts nonlinear inhomogeneities of the metric into a smooth spacetime with implications
for the Hubble tension.
For simplicity, in the following, radiation will be neglected and a vanishing spatial curvature

Rather than transforming the FLRW metric with scale factor aΛCDM into static spacetime,
the conformal factor ψ−2 is now used to cast the Universe into another FLRW metric with
different expansion ˜atarget. Thus, ψ = aΛCDM/˜atarget such that

Importantly, it follows from Eq. (35) that the mass of the matter field Ψm is now evolving as

(56)
Furthermore, while conformal time τ remains the same, cosmic time changes due to the confor-
mal transformation, d˜t = (˜atarget/aΛCDM)dt.
For convenience, in the following, the indices ‘ΛCDM’ and ‘target’ will be dropped.
4.1
Einstein-de Sitter background
In an Einstein-de Sitter universe, the scale factor evolves as ˜a ∝˜t2/3 ∝τ 2. Since ΛCDM is
Einstein-de Sitter at early times, in the limit of τ →0, one has ˜a = a and ˜t = t. The scale
factor can be normalised at aeq as in Eq. (49). Given the absence of an era of Λ domination,
in Einstein-de Sitter spacetime, aeq can be thought of as a normalisation for when c2κ2˜ρ falls
below a given threshold Λ. It follows that at early times, ˜m = m, and at late times,

4.2
De Sitter background
In de Sitter spacetime, one has a constant Hubble function ˜H = t−1
Λ , the scale factor evolves as
˜a = ˜adSe˜t/tΛ = tΛ(˜τ∞−τ)−1, and conformal and cosmic times relate as τ = ˜τ∞−˜a−1
dS tΛe−˜t/tΛ.
Normalising ˜τ∞= τ∞by suitable choice of ψ, one finds that ˜m = m at late times and

at early times.
Hence, similarly to interpreting dark energy as the late-time divergent increase of particle
masses, in this frame, one may interpret dark matter as the effect of an early-time increase of
particle masses with τ 2 that converges to a constant mass m at late times.
4.3
Nonlinear inhomogeneities
Rather than casting the cosmic structure encompassed in the nonlinearly perturbed FLRW
metric (45) into Minkowski space, one may cast it into smooth FLRW spacetime instead. This
will lead to a similar interpretation of changing mass, length and time scales as in Sec. 3.3,
which vary locally with respect to the cosmological background.
The following discussion will focus on conformal inhomogeneities, which are a special type of
nonlinear inhomogeneities that have not been studied in much detail. Particularly, in Refs. [25,
26], they were proposed as a simultaneous solution of cosmological tensions in the measured
Hubble constant H0, the amplitude of matter fluctuations σ8, and the amplitude of CMB
lensing AL, which would be found from residing in a local conformal void. The nonlinearly
conformally perturbed FLRW metric has also been dubbed Conformal Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-
Robertson-Walker (CFLRW) cosmology in Ref. [27].
Consider the scenario where we occupy a local conformal inhomogeneity in a ΛCDM FLRW
(or CFLRW) universe such that aΛCDM(τ) →aΛCDM(τ, x) ≡C(τ, x)¯aΛCDM(τ) with conformal
factor C2. Proceeding as in Secs. 4.1 and 4.2, let the target cosmology be a smooth ΛCDM
FLRW metric, ˜aΛCDM(τ) = ¯aΛCDM(τ). This implies the evolution of masses in this frame as
˜m = aΛCDM(τ, x)
¯aΛCDM(τ) m = C(τ, x)m .
(59)
Eqs. (37) and (38) imply that redshifts relate as 1 + z = C0(1 + ¯z)/C(τs, xs) = 1 + ˜z, where
the conformal factor C2
0 ≡C2
obs is defined at the spacetime location of the observer and ¯z is
the redshift one would obtain if both source and observer resided in the smooth background.
Defining masses at the location of the observer, one has
˜m = C(τ, x)
C0
˜m0 .
(60)
For a simple application, one may adopt a top-hat inhomogeneity of radius R with C =

(1+δ)−1/3, where ρm = ¯ρm(1+δ). At the spacetime location of the observer, C0 = (1+δ0)−1/3,
and for a source outside the top hat in the smooth background, Cs = 1. In this case, masses
evolve as ˜m = m = C−1
0
˜m0 = (1 + δ0)1/3 ˜m0 and redshifts relate as 1 + z = C0(1 + ¯z) =
(1 + δ0)−1/3(1 + ¯z) = 1 + ˜z.
This implies that if assuming particles, or larger massive objects, to be located in the smooth
cosmological FLRW background, one ought to correct for the local evolution of their masses
and adapt redshifts accordingly to correctly interpret observations.
Let us briefly consider the consequences of failing to do so. The matter contribution to the
Hubble function in the background is given by
¯H2 ⊃κ2¯ρm0
3
(1 + ¯z)3 = κ2¯ρm0
3
(1 + δ0)(1 + z)3 .
(61)
Importantly, as discussed in Sec. 3.1.2, one observes the frame-invariant redshift z = ˜z and not
¯z. Thus, wrongly assuming ¯z = z for a source outside the top hat with background density
¯ρm will give (1 + δ0)−1/2 ¯H0 rather than the Hubble parameter ¯H0. Hence, if we reside in a
conformal top-hat underdensity δ0 < 0 and interpret our observations by placing ourselves into
the smooth cosmological background instead, we infer an enhanced effective Hubble parameter.
Specifically, a ∼10% enhancement of ¯H0 requires a ∼20% conformal underdensity [25,26]. Note
that the size of the conformal void R does not need to be large to change the inferred Hubble
parameter as opposed to that of conventional voids. A diameter of a few tens of megaparsecs
may be sufficient [25,26]. This scenario will be further investigated in Sec. 5.2.

Applications
Casting cosmology into Minkowski space in Sec. 3 has revealed a reinterpretation of cosmic
expansion as an evolution of particle masses with time (also see Ref. [23]) and more generally, a
variation of time, length and mass scales across spacetime for a perturbed and spatially curved
Cosmos. Alternatively, adopting Einstein-de Sitter and de Sitter backgrounds in Secs. 4.1 and
4.2 suggested an interpretation of dark energy and dark matter as evolving particle masses
that respectively diverge and converge with proceeding age of the Universe.
As described
in Secs. 4.3, conformal inhomogeneities defined by a conformal factor separating them from
the smooth cosmological background offer a potential solution to the Hubble tension (also see
Refs. [25,26]).
The applications of geometric transformations of the cosmic spacetime are manifold, and
the following discussions will adumbrate a few particularly promising ones. In Sec. 5.1, the cos-
mological constant problem is revisited in the cosmological Minkowski frame of Sec. 3. Sec. 5.2
further examines the conformal inhomogeneities and in particular a local conformal cosmic void
as a simultaneous solution of the H0, σ8, and AL tensions and identifies further observable im-
plications of those. Finally, in Sec. 5.3, candidates for dark matter, inflation and baryogenesis
are identified that emerge from the formalism of Sec. 3.1. It should be emphasised that the
discussions provided here are far from exhaustive and should thus only serve as stimulus for
further investigation.

5.1
Naturalness of the cosmological constant
In light of the importance of the cosmological constant problem (Sec. 1), it is worthwhile revisit-
ing it in the Minkowski frame of Sec. 3 for a possible reinterpretation of the problem. Sec. 5.1.1
examines the naturalness of the value of the cosmological constant for the Universe cast into
Minkowski space. Sec. 5.1.2 inspects the consistency with the gravitating ground state energy
density from canonical quantisation in this frame. In this process, the scale factor of the metric
will be treated as a scalar field and quantised. It should be emphasised, however, that one could
instead proceed analogously with the quantisation of a matter field Ψm as given by Eq. (33) to
arrive at the same conclusions.
5.1.1
The scale factor as a scalar field
For the following discussion, let us for simplicity assume ˜R = 0 and ˜T = 0 and redefine ψ →iψ
in Eq. (16). Note that the new field ψ must not need to be imaginary as one may also take
a →ia, representing a rotation of metric signature, such that ψ = a remains real. This gives
the scalar field action
Sψ =
Z
d4x

−1
2∂µψ∂µψ −V (ψ)

,
(62)
where V = Λψ4/6. The scalar field equation becomes
˜□ψ −2
3Λψ3 ,
(63)
where one may identify the effective mass m2 = V ′′(ψ) = 2Λ(ψℏ/c)2. More formally, consider
a small perturbation δψ around ψ∗= a(τ∗) such that ψ = ψ∗(1 + δψ). Additionally making the
field redefinition χ = 1 + 2δψ, the potential can be rewritten as 6V/Λ = ψ4 ≃ψ4
∗(1 + 2δψ)2 =
ψ4
∗χ2. Variation of the action with respect to χ yields the field equation ˜□χ −(4/3)Λψ2
∗χ with
the Klein-Gordan mass given by m2
χ = (4/3)Λ(ψ∗ℏ/c)2. The mass associated with the field ψ
thus varies as
m ∼ℏ
c
√
Λa .
(64)
This time dependence of m has important implications for the question of the naturalness of Λ
as inferring its value from a mass scale, Λ ∼m2/a2, implies a choice of a.
Consider the Planck time tp with ap ≡a(tp) and the present t0 with a0 ≡a(t0).
Let
us furthermore normalise the scale factor at Planck time, ap = 1 (one could also normalise
masses as ˆm = m/ap instead), and assume that the volume of our currently observable Universe
originated from a Planck volume at Planck time ℓ3
u = (a0/ap)3ℓ3
p with Planck length ℓp. Our
observations imply ℓu ∼1061ℓp. For a Plank mass mp of the field ψ today, m0 = mp, one
therefore finds

Thus, in this frame, Λ takes on a natural value set by the Planck scale and the size of the
present Universe.
This may not seem surprising given that we are located at an era of equality between Λ and

κ2c2ρm, where the size of the Universe is set by the scale of Λ, ℓu ∼ℓΛ ≡ctΛ. Importantly,
however, one should consider m∗=
√
Λℏc−1 as the fundamental mass scale whereas the field
mass mχ is subject to the time of evaluation of a(t) in Eq. (64) and only becomes mp at a0.
The fact that ℓu ∼ℓΛ is therefore attributed to the coincidence or Why now? problem of why
Λκ−2 ≈ρmc2 today whereas these energy densities differ by orders of magnitude in the past and
future of the Universe. To make this connection, note that ℓu/ℓp ∼t0/tp. Matter domination
implies H0 ∼t−1
0
and when Λ dominates, H ∼t−1
Λ . Hence, at matter-Λ equality, t0 ≈tΛ such
that ℓu/ℓp ∼tΛ/tp.
A solution to the coincidence problem in turn is provided by anthropic considerations. This
can simply be in the sense of an observer’s bias on the observer’s location in cosmic history
without the need to invoke a multiverse. For that, assume a universe configured by the funda-
mental mass scale given by
√
Λℏc−1 and the matter energy density ρm at their observed values.
As described in Ref. [28], this universe produces a star formation peak at the age of ∼4 Gyr
whereas terrestrial planet formation peaks at ∼8 Gyr, making Earth a typical sample from this
distribution. If the time it took on Earth to develop observers can be considered typical, the
most likely epoch for observers to emerge in the Universe is around the equality between Λ and
κ2c2ρm, setting t0 ≈tΛ, ℓu ≈ℓΛ and mp ∼a(t0)
√
Λℏc−1.
Thus, neither the observed value of Λ nor the comparable size of κ2c2ρm today seem prob-
lematic in Minkowski space.
5.1.2
Canonical quantisation of the scale factor
For completeness, let us compute Λ from the ground state energy density attributed to canonical
quantisation of the field ψ. For the Lagrangian density L in Eq. (63), the canonical momentum
and classical Hamiltonian are given by
π =
δL
δ∂0ψ ,
H =
Z
d3x [π∂0ψ −L] ,
(66)
where the model is quantised with the commutator
h
ˆψ(x), ˆπ(y)
i
= iℏδ(x −y) .
(67)
As in Sec. 5.1.1, we shall define the Klein-Gordan field χ with mass mχ for small perturbations
around ψ∗. The ground state energy density for that is
ϵ0 = 1
2
Z
d3k
(2π)3

(kℏc)2 + (mχc2)2 .
(68)
Taking mχ as the ultraviolet cutoff, one obtains
ϵ0 ∼m4

∼ℏcΛ2a4 .

For the gravitating vacuum energy density in Minkowski space, one therefore has

5.2
Observed cosmological tensions
A conformal transformation was used in Sec. 4.3 to cast a universe where we occupy a conformal
top-hat inhomogeneity into one where we reside in the smooth cosmological FRLW background
geometry. The implication of that was that masses of particles and larger objects as well as red-
shifts would rescale with the local density field. Failing to account for these modifications shifts
inferred cosmological quantities such as the cosmic expansion rate. Refs. [25, 26] showed that
corrections from residing in a local conformal cosmic void of ∼20% underdensity of a few tens
of megaparsecs in diameter simultaneously solves the current tensions between measurements
of the Hubble constant H0 as well as of the amplitude of matter fluctuations σ8 and restores a
preference for a consistent CMB lensing amplitude of AL = 1 (Sec. 1). Specifically, in the frame
adopted in Ref. [26], the local CMB temperature T0 deviates from that of the cosmological back-
ground ¯T0 as T0 = ¯T0(1+δ0)1/3, which changes parameters inferred from the CMB, particularly
lowering σ8 and AL and increasing H0. Allowing for spatial curvature, Planck, baryon acoustic
oscillations and H0 data then prefer an open and hotter universe at > 3σ [26].
The framework established in Secs. 2–4 can be used to study further properties and observ-
able signatures of conformal inhomogeneities. In the following, Sec. 5.2.1 will focus on their
nonlinear evolution whereas Sec. 5.2.2 will explore the linear limit, where observable signatures
will be highlighted for both regimes.
5.2.1
Conformal cosmic void
Consider a local conformal top-hat inhomogeneity with scale factor ˆa of a smooth FLRW
background metric with scale factor a. Following Sec. 4.3, this defines the conformal factor
ψ = ˆa/a = (1 + δ)−1/3.
Using the second Friedmann equation (28) both for ˆa and a, one
recovers the spherical collapse equation,
¨δ + 2H ˙δ −4
3
˙δ2
1 + δ = κ2c4
2
¯ρm(1 + δ)δ ,
(72)
where dots denote derivatives with respect to the cosmic time t of the smooth FLRW back-
ground, dt = a dτ. Note that while conformal times between the two frames agree, cosmic times
do not, t ̸= ˆt. The evolution of δ and thus of ˆa can be solved for setting the initial conditions
at ai ≪1 in the matter-dominated regime, where δ ∝a. The interior of the conformal top-hat
inhomogeneity thus evolves as a usual top-hat density contrast. This is not surprising in light
of Birkhoff’s theorem. Density perturbations can be viewed as separate universes with different
background density and curvature. For a top-hat density perturbation this becomes manifest
adopting Conformal Fermi Coordinates [29]. Also recall from Sec. 3.1 that any smooth FLRW
metric describing the interior of the top hat has vanishing Weyl tensor and is thus conformally
flat.

Besides the impact of a local conformal void on currently measured cosmological parameter
tensions, the presence of conformal perturbations can have further observable implications.
Revisiting the relation of measured redshift z to its background counterpart ¯z in Sec. 4.3,
1 + z =
1 + δs
1 + δ0
1/3
(1 + ¯z) ,
(73)
one can see that redshifts are not only impacted by the environment of the observer but also
by that of the sources, where both satisfy the evolution equation (72). Particularly, this implies
that photons emitted from galaxy clusters (δs > 0) and detected in our underdense environment
(δ0 < 0) may be significantly more redshifted than expected from ¯z. As a consequence, one may
attribute larger distances and older ages to observed galaxies in clusters, and consequently find
larger masses and population sizes for those than expected. This effect may offer an explanation
for recent observations [30–32]. Of course, the local underdense environment may also lead
to astronomical signatures in our immediate neighbourhood, and it is worthwhile noting that
measurements of nearby galaxy groups [33], clusters [34] and peculiar velocities [35] indeed seem
to indicate such an underdense local region.
In view of these effects, one may wonder about the nature of the coupling of matter fields with
the local scale factor at a source ψ = as suggested by Eqs. (16)–(20). After all, photon-emitting
sources typically lie in virialised regions, which have decoupled from the cosmic expansion, or
inside compact bodies, and so as = const. at the immediate location of the emitting particle
process. Likewise, a0 = const. at the immediate position of our detectors. However, when
observing sources from virialised regions that are detached from ours, an expansion takes place
between them. In the non-expanding frame, the coupling hence corresponds to an effective
coupling of the entire virialised region to the evolving scale factor of its environment and of that
to the cosmological background or the space separating this region from ours. This coupling can
then be viewed as acting on the individual particles composing those regions. Schematically,
one has ψ = a = avir · aenv · ¯a, where avir = const. and aenv may represent a composition of
environments, aenv = aenv(1) · · · aenv(n).
5.2.2
Linear cosmological perturbations
To explore further observable signatures attributed to the presence of conformal inhomogeneities
in the Cosmos, one may resort to linear perturbation theory. For that, consider the linearised
conformal factor ψ2(τ, x) = 1 + 2δψ(τ, x), where |δψ| ≪1, acting in front of the linearly per-
turbed FLRW line element in conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge, Eq. (46). Operating
in the linear regime, one may simply absorb the conformal factor by defining the new potentials
ˆΨ ≡Ψ + δψ and ˆΦ ≡Φ + δψ. The usual linearly perturbed Einstein field equations apply for
ˆΨ and ˆΦ. Importantly, however, the notion of cosmic time may change with the absorption of
the conformal factor, dt = a dτ ̸= a(1 + δψ)dτ. Given linearity, one may split the perturbed
energy-momentum tensor as δTµν = δT (ψ)
µν + δT (0)
µν , where δT (0)
µν determines Ψ and Φ. Thus, the

It should be emphasised again that dots represent here derivatives with respect to the cosmic
time dt = a dτ rather than dt = a(1+δψ)dτ, which can give rise to effective fluid perturbations.
To illustrate this point, consider separating off a fraction of the scale factor of the smooth FLRW
metric as a →a(1 + δa) such that δψ = δa(t) and ∇2δa = 0 everywhere. Eqs. (74) and (76)
then directly follow from the linearised first and second Friedmann equations, Eqs. (26) and
(28), respectively, under the transformations of the scale factor and of cosmic time, where δρ(a)
and δP (a) are the density and pressure perturbations attributed to δa. For instance, one may
separate out a different background matter density ¯ρ(a)
m (see Sec. 2), giving rise to an effective
density contrast δρ(a)
m = ¯ρ(a)
m δ(a) and δP (a)
m = 0. As another example, given that spatially curved
FRLW metrics are conformally flat (Sec. 3.1), one may treat a small spatial curvature as a linear
conformal perturbation δψ = δa of a flat background.
From the field equations (74)–(77), one can already identify some interesting observable
implications of linear conformal perturbations without the need for solving the system of differ-
ential equations. Consider the fluid comoving density in Fourier space,
∆= δ + 3(1 + w) aH
c2k2 θ .
(80)
Note that for δψ = δa(t), this density vanishes, ∆(a) = 0.

Thus, lensing remains unaffected by the presence of the conformal inhomogeneity, as expected
for a conformal factor, whereas dynamic, or kinematic, effects such as clustering are modified
in Eq. (83). The conformal inhomogeneity acts like an effective modification of gravity with

Thus, for clusters with ∆m > 0 and for ∆(ψ) < ∆m, this implies that cluster masses inferred
dynamically, or kinematically, Mdyn, are underestimated compared to masses inferred from
lensing, Mlen. This mass bias is indeed observed but typically associated with deviations from
hydrostatic equilibrium affecting the estimations of Mdyn [36]. The growth suppression µ < 1
in Eq. (85) may also act to lower σ8 as preferred by galaxy surveys [9]. Note that in contrast,
modified gravity models typically produce µ > 1 as well as Mdyn > Mlen [37] for theoretical
stability reasons [38]. It is also worthwhile noting that for conformal inhomogeneities, ∆(ψ)/∆m
may also be negative, for example in voids, such that µ > 1 and Mdyn > Mlen instead.

Dark matter, inflation and baryogenesis
In Sec. 4.2, an interpretation of dark matter as the effect of an early-time convergent increase of
particle masses was given. Similarly, as discussed in Sec. 4.1, dark energy could be interpreted
as the late-time divergent increase of particle masses. These interpretations were motivated
by the change of the cosmic geometry into de Sitter and Einstein-de Sitter space, respectively.
In the following, another candidate of geometric origin for dark matter as well as for inflation
shall briefly be explored, which is motivated from treating the scale factor as a scalar field as
in Sec. 5.1.
Let us revisit the action (62), which for the field χ ≡1 + 2δψ becomes

shall describe an evolving smooth FLRW background obtained after a conformal transforma-
tion, for example, of a conformal inhomogeneity similar to Sec. 4.3. Thus, δψ describes the
perturbation of the relative scale factor around ψ∗= a∗/¯a∗. In the interior, the field is only

time dependent such that the scalar field equation implies
¨χ + 3H ˙χ + m2
χχ = 0 .
(88)
Eq. (88) suggests that χ may act as an axion [39]. Let us assume the initial condition ˙χ = 0.
For H > mχ, the axion field is overdamped and frozen to its initial value with an equation of
state of wχ = −1 such that it may act as dark energy or drive inflation. For H < mχ, the axion
field is underdamped, oscillating around wχ = 0 with energy density ρχ ∼a−3. Hence, in this
case, it may act as dark matter.
Finally, the transformed action (16) could also have implications for baryogenesis, irrespec-
tive of the axion treatment, where couplings could introduce a CP violation causing baryoge-
nesis [39]. For this, consider quantum gravity corrections in the action such as the term R2.
Besides being a potential source of inflation [40], this term can also provide a coupling relevant
to baryogenesis in the conformally transformed action. Specifically, with Eq. (9) one finds from
integration by parts the term
√−gR2 ∝−
p
−˜g ˜Jµ∂µ ˜R + . . . ,
(89)
defining the current ˜Jµ ≡∂µ ln ψ = ˜T −1 ˜∇σ ˜T µ
σ with Eq. (20), where ˜∇µ ˜Jµ can be non-vanishing
with Eq. (19). This is reminiscent of the CP-violating coupling √−gJµ
B−L∂µR for gravitational
baryogenesis [41–43], where for a non-conserved baryon-lepton current JB−L net B −L charge
is generated.
A more detailed analysis of Eqs. (88) and (89) is left for future work.

Conclusions
Despite the resounding success of the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM) in reproducing our
wealth of cosmological observations, there remains a number of unexplained larger and smaller
tensions among the cosmological model parameters inferred from our different data sets. Be-
sides these observational tensions, significant gaps persist in our theoretical understanding of
key ΛCDM ingredients. The cosmological constant problem, the nature of dark matter and
inflation, or the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe constitute particu-
larly important and profound enigmas among them. Both these observational and theoretical
challenges motivate the development and search for new physics. In contrast, a less radical
approach to venturing beyond the Standard Model is the simple mathematical reformulation
of our theoretical frameworks underlying it. This can offer reinterpretations and possibly even
solutions of these problems.
This article explored the implications of casting cosmology into different spacetime geome-
tries by a combination of conformal transformations and the dimensional reduction of the cos-
mological spacetime metric applied to the Einstein-Hilbert action and Einstein field equations.
Although simply a mathematical manipulation that leaves physical measurements unaffected,
new perspectives on the observational and theoretical challenges to ΛCDM were attained. A
particular focus was thereby placed on casting cosmology into Minkowski space. Clearly, the

Minkowski metric occupies a special place among the metrics one could transform the cosmic
geometry into. It is static and flat as well as the spacetime of special relativity and quantum
field theory or indeed of the entire Standard Model.
Applications of the formalism developed here are manifold, and the article has identified a
number of those, which shall briefly be summarised in the following. It should be emphasised,
however, that the discussions provided in this context were far from exhaustive and are meant
to serve as inspiration for further work on Minkowskian cosmology.
(1) Rather than due to an expanding Cosmos, observed redshifts to distant galaxies can
be interpreted as the evolution of particle masses after conformal transformation of the FLRW
metric into static or Minkowski space. This recovers the Friedmann equations and the evolution
of energy densities, and importantly, leaves measurements such as redshifts invariant.
(2) The transformation into Minkowski space can be performed even in the presence of
spatial curvature. This can either be achieved with a conformal transformation adopting suitable
coordinates in which the vanishing Weyl tensor and thus the conformal flatness of the spatially
curved FLRW metric becomes apparent or through the combination of dimensional reduction
and conformal transformations of the metric. In this case, spatial curvature can be interpreted
as varying length scale. Alternatively, small spatial curvature may also be treated as an example
of a linear conformal inhomogeneity.
(3) Following a similar procedure to the decomposition of the spatially curved FLRW met-
ric, cosmic structure and gravitational waves can be viewed as distortions and oscillations of
mass, length, and time scales in the Minkowski frame. Alternatively, these distortions may be
interpreted as the variation of the speed of light, the Planck constant and the gravitational
coupling.
(4) A particularly promising application of the framework was identified with casting the
cosmological constant problem into Minkowskian cosmology.
Specifically, in the Minkowski
frame, Λ was found to take on a natural value set by the Planck scale and the size of the
present Universe. This value is furthermore consistent with the gravitating vacuum ground
state energy density obtained from canonical quantisation of the scale factor with cutoff at the
evolving Planck mass. This reduces the cosmological constant to the Why Now? or coincidence
problem, for which anthropic arguments can be invoked as remedy. This can be in form of a
simple observer’s bias for our location in cosmic history that does not necessitate a multiverse.
(5) Geometric candidates for dark matter and dark energy also naturally emerge from the
formalism. For example, adopting an Einstein-de Sitter and de Sitter background suggested
an interpretation of dark energy and dark matter as evolving particle masses that respectively
diverge and converge with proceeding age of the Universe.
Another geometric dark matter
candidate arises from treating conformal inhomogeneities in the scale factor as a scalar field.
This field can behave as an axion and could act as dark matter or dark energy.
(6) Geometric candidates for inflation and baryogenesis constitute another application. Be-
sides serving as dark sector candidate, the geometric axion field also offers a promising candidate
for inflation. Couplings to the field may furthermore introduce a CP violation that could give
rise to baryogensis. Another interesting candidate is found in the Minkowski frame of a possible
R2 term in the Einstein-Hilbert action that can arise from quantum gravity corrections. Besides

offering a source for inflation, the transformed action contains a term that resembles that of the
CP-violating coupling of gravitational baryogenesis.
(7) Finally, the presence of conformal inhomogeneities in our Universe can offer a simulta-
neous solution to the Hubble tension, the discrepant measurements in the amplitude of matter
fluctuations as well as the preference for a non-standard lensing amplitude in CMB anisotropies,
provided we are located in an underdense conformal region of space. Conformal inhomogeneities
can furthermore enhance redshifts to distant galaxies, causing larger distances and older ages
to be attributed to galaxies in clusters and consequently larger masses and population sizes
than otherwise expected for those. Another effect is a mass bias for the inferred masses of
galaxy clusters, where masses inferred from lensing are larger than those inferred dynamically
or kinematically. It is worth highlighting that these predictions agree qualitatively with trends
identified in current observations and may thus be worthwhile further investigating.
There is good reason to expect that this list of applications is far from exhaustive. For
instance, one may also employ the formalism for the conformally flat interior of black holes and
stars to gain a new perspective on the physical nature of those. Moreover, for a Schwarzschild
or Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, one can perform the analogous change of coordinates to
Eqs. (40)–(42) such that their metrics assume the form of Eq. (45). From Eq. (47) it then follows
that ˜m = m
p
1 −rs/r −Λr2/3 for the mass of a test particle, which vanishes at the horizon
rs for Λ = 0. The changes of time and length scales can be worked out accordingly. Further
applications may include the exploration of the Minkowski picture in the Palatini formalism
or its generalisation to teleparallel gravity [44, 45] and other extended theories of gravity [11,
15]. The discussion provided here on the applications of the formalism only served as brief
adumbration of those, intended as a basis for further work on Minkowskian cosmology. The
promising implications highlighted in this context certainly suggest that this will be a worthwhile
endeavour.
