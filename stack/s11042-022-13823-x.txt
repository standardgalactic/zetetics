Abstract
One of the most popular techniques in the field of image retargeting or content-aware
resizing a digital image is the seam-carving technique. The performance of image resizing
algorithms based on seam-carving indicates that these algorithms are highly dependent on
the extraction of importance map techniques. So far, various algorithms have been proposed
to extract the importance map. In this paper, a new method based on information entropy
is proposed to extract of importance map. Also, a new method for selecting the most opti-
mal seam based on the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents is presented. In simulating
the proposed method, two datasets MSRA and RetargetMe have been used, which use two
statistical opinions criteria and aspect ratio similarity (ARS) to evaluate the performance
of the proposed method. Simulation results based on dynamical systems analysis showed
that the proposed algorithm performs better than the classical seam-carving and generalized
seam-carving algorithms.

1 Introduction
Images are one of the most important types of digital media. Nowadays, due to the wide
variety of software for displaying an image on the media such as handsets, computers,
and tablets, the problem of displaying images with different dimensions and resolutions on
different display devices is one of the interesting research fields [1, 21, 26].
There are different methods for image resizing such as scaling and cropping. The crop-
ping method is used to remove the outer parts of the digital image. It cuts a part of the
image unintentionally to the size of the final image and discards the rest of the image. In
this method, the removed parts may contain important information that is discarded. Unlike
the cropping method, the scaling operator does not remove any part of the image but rather
rescales the image uniformly to achieve the desired dimensions. One of the disadvantages
of the scaling method is neglecting the content of the image as the whole image becomes

smaller or larger. In order to overcome the weaknesses of the scaling and cropping meth-
ods, content-aware resizing methods have been proposed. One of the most popular method
in this field is seam carving (SC) technique [1, 44]. The SC method selects and deletes a
left-to-right or top-down line of interconnected pixels with the lowest energy. By deleting or
sequentially inserting the seams, the image size is reduced or increased. The selected seams
ensure that the image structure is preserved and the low-energy pixels are eliminated and
that in enlarging the image, a balance is ensured between the original image and the enlarged
image. This is an act of image content-aware retargeting techniques. In the research liter-
ature, the use of object recognition algorithms can be integrated as a solution with image
resizing techniques [7, 10, 19, 23, 24, 32].
Chaotic dynamical systems have potential applications in image processing and sig-
nal processing. Over the last two decades dynamical systems tools have a central role for
qualitative analysis of the digital images. In the field of image processing, based on informa-
tion entropy, various tasks including pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) [8], image
encryption [2, 64], image and video watermarking [3, 16], digital steganography [55], image
compression, and medical image segmentation have been done and acceptable results have
been obtained [17, 56]. In this paper, information entropy is used to identify low impor-
tance areas in the image. Given the importance of this discussion, we try to introduce a new
importance map that can identify the low importance areas in the image using entropy and
perform better than the classical seam carving methods.
The remain parts of this paper is organized as follows: In the Section 2, techniques related
to content-aware image resizing are discussed. In the Section 3, an introduction to dynamical
systems, entropy analysis as well as Lyapunov exponent is investigated. Section 4 presents
proposed image resizing algorithm. Performance evaluation and experimental results of the
proposed method are presented in Section 5. The comparison of proposed method with
similar algorithms is shown in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.
2 Related works
In this section, we will try to explore the seam carving related techniques in more detail.
Essentially, image resizing based on content-aware techniques are divided into three cate-
gories: (1) cropping techniques, (2) wrapping techniques, and (3) seam carving techniques.
The details of each of these methods are described in the next subsections.
2.1 Content-aware cropping
In these techniques, the image’s important content is first identified and then the cropping
is applied to the original image. The basis for identifying important regions is to obtain a
salient map in the images [28, 49]. In the mentioned methods, also face detection technique
is proposed to improve the quality of the proposed method. In method [11], the image
attention model is used to extract semantic information of the image such as face and text
[49]. Also in method [65], particle swarm optimization is used as an optimization algorithm
for auto-cropping of image.
A semi-automatic identification algorithm based on the attention region is presented
using human gaze estimation in method [48]. The proposed method in [34] has used the sup-
port vector machine as a machine learning algorithm for the identification process of salient
distribution. A quality classifier for identifying acceptable regions is presented in method
[41], and in method [38], a technique for searching a cropping window is used to obtain a
19418
Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417–19440

region of the image with the highest salient density. The major disadvantage of cropping-
based techniques is the existence of several important regions in the image, which can only
identify one important region and discard the rest of the image regions.
2.2 Seam carving methods
In image processing techniques, the seam carving is an operation that resizes a digital image
(enlarges or reduces) based on awareness of the image content. Accordingly, pixels of the
image that play a key role in the human visual system is retained and the rest ignored to
improve the efficiency of the human perception process [9].
A seam is a path with 8-connected of low-importance pixels from top to bottom or left to
right, which called vertical and horizontal seams, respectively. In other words, the vertical
seam consists of a path of pixels in the columns of an image and a horizontal seam of paths
of pixels in the rows of an image. Removing seams will reduce the size of the image as well
as duplicate the seams to increase the size of an image. The basic seam carving algorithm
[1] uses the gradient energy function to determine the importance of each pixel based on the
following equation:
e(I) =| ∂
∂x I | + | ∂
∂y I |
(1)
Where I, e(I) is a source image and its calculated energy, respectively. A vertical seam in
the seam carving technique is defined as follows:
Sx = {Sx
i }n
i=1 = {x(i), i}n
i=1, s.t., ∀i, | x(i) −x(i −1) |≤1,
(2)
where x : [1, ..., n] −→[1, ..., m]. The definition of the horizontal seam will be similar to
the definition of the vertical seam.The following equation expresses the vertical seam pixels
(S):
IS = {I(Si)}n
i=1 = {I(x(i), i)}n
i=1
(3)
The following equation, which is the sum of the pixel energies, is used to calculate the cost
of a seam S that contains n pixel:
Scost(s) = Scost(Is) =
n

i=1
e(I(si))
(4)
By minimizing the cost of the seam, the optimal seam (S∗) can be calculated based on the
following equation:
S∗= min Scost(IS) = min
n

i=1
e(I(Si))
(5)
Dynamic programming methods can be used to find the optimal seam. The first step in
finding the optimal vertical seam is to calculate the minimum cumulative energy. To obtain
this energy (M), all possible connections from the second row to the last row for entry (i,j)
are calculated as follows:
M(i, j) = e(i, j) + min
⎧
⎨
⎩
M(i −1, j −1),
M(i −1, j),
M(i −1, j + 1),
(6)
The last value obtained from the last row contains the maximum cumulative energy. For this
reason, the last row values are used to select the optimal seam, the least value representing
19419
Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417–19440

the desired seam is selected and the bottom-up operation is performed in the vertical seam
method. The seam carving process is repeated over and over to resize the image as best as
possible. In reducing the image size, after removing the seam, the neighboring pixels are
shifted to the left or up. This method has also been used for image and video resizing in
2009 by Shamir and Vidan [52].
Due to the use of the basic seam carving technique of the backward method, as well as
ignoring the energy injected into the image after the removing of the optimal seam, Method
[44] used a forward energy criterion. According to this method, the seams are selected as the
optimal seam from the minimum total energy injected and the cumulative energy obtained.
The authors have reported that this method produces fewer artifact effects on the resized
image. The cumulative matrix (M) is calculated as follows:
M(i, j) = e(i, j) + min
⎧
⎨
⎩
CL(i, j) + M(i −1, j −1),
CU(i, j) + M(i −1, j),
CR(i, j) + M(i −1, j + 1),
(7)
where CL, CU and CR are image gradients resulting from non- adjacent pixels becoming
neighbors after removing the seam, which are calculated as follows:
CU(i, j) =| I(i, j + 1) −I(i, j −1) |,
CL(i, j) =| I(i −1, j) −I(i, j −1) | +CU(i, j),
CR(i, j) =| I(i −1, j) −I(i, j + 1) | +CU(i, j).
(8)
Edge detection is the main criterion of energy extraction in these methods, one of the major
disadvantages of this method is noise sensitivity. For this reason, the gradient must be recal-
culated after each seam is selected and the cumulative energy updated. In method [4], the
previous equation is rewritten as follows:
CU(i, j) = ∥I(i, j + 1) −I(i, j −1)∥,
CL(i, j) = ∥I(i −1, j) −I(i, j −1)∥+ CU(i, j),
CR(i, j) = ∥I(i −1, j) −I(i, j + 1)∥+ CU(i, j).
(9)
where |.| denotes to L2−norm in this equation. Based on the reported results of this method,
images with different background colors have better results.
Method [13], as the sparse seam carving method, presents the energy calculated in (7) as
follows:
M(i, j) = e(i, j) + min
⎧
⎨
⎩
CL(i, j) + M(i −1, j −1) + λS(i, j),
CU(i, j) + M(i −1, j) + λS(i, j),
CR(i, j) + M(i −1, j + 1) + λS(i, j),
(10)
In this equation S(i, j) is the constraint term and its control parameter is λ. Constraint term
is defined by the following equation:
S(i, j) = 1
k

(r,c)∈N(i,j)
W(r, c)
(11)
Where K is the normalization factor, N(i, j) including the 8-neighborhood of (i, j) and W
is the seam map that is updated at each step. The authors have reported that the proposed
method works better than other methods for images containing lines and edges.
19420
Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417–19440

In method [21], the authors used the neighborhood inhomogeneity factor (NIF) as a new
importance map that introduced the NIF as a set of inhomogenous neighbors in a pixel.
Another method of seam carving is to use a low-order polynomial-time algorithm to
optimally select multiple seams instead of one seam [25]. In other methods, scaling and
wrapping have been used as a new operator in seam carving techniques. For example, in
method [50], a hybrid importance map is used, using a gradient map, saliency map, and
depth map. Also, an adaptive algorithm for weighting each of the three maps is presented.
In method [67], a hybrid seam carving and wrapping method are presented, in which, after
identifying high-energy seams, the wrapping techniques are applied to the image using these
seams. Another method of seam carving is to use a low-order polynomial-time algorithm to
optimally select multiple seams instead of one seam [25]. In paper [20], a new method based
on four principles of psychology for context-aware saliency is proposed, the purpose of
which is to identify the scene regions in the image. Another method uses a global gradient-
based feature to identify the rough position of salients objects in an image [27].
Detecting seam carving is an important security challenge in image forensics. Of course,
in the research literature, various methods have been proposed to identify seam carving
based on security methods [35, 62, 63, 69].
2.3 Continuous methods or Warping methods
The previously mentioned methods were mostly discrete methods.The basis of this method
is based on a nonlinear function that maps the source image to a specified region in the target
image. In this re-targeting method, a grid or mesh is used on the image that distorts the non-
importance region of the image. In method [37], the region of interest is selected and the
rest of the image region is wrapped by a nonlinear fisheye function. Another approach in
this area is presented in method [18], which is retained through a two-dimensional texture
mapping by masked image, and the rest of the image region is wrapped.
Also in method [57], a scale-and-stretch method is used that calculates the scale factor
for each local region and deforms the region based on the importance map. The use of
quadratic distortion energy based on shape preservation is presented in method [66], which
operates on a mesh grid. In this method, by optimizing the quadratic distortion energy many
image edges and important objects in the image are preserved.
In addition to the methods mentioned above, the method [29] utilizes non-homogeneous
scaling optimization to real-time image resizing that the authors wrapped images based on
quadratic optimization on a triangular mesh. Also, a non-homogeneous wrapping method
has been used in the method [40], which is based on the quadratic metrics to formulate the
image resizing process. This method does not work well for more prominent components
in images, despite maintaining the general structure of the image. Alternatively, mesh struc-
tures are used to prevent a shape in the image [22]. Also, another method in the continuous
field is the just noticeable distortion model, which is proposed based on the calculation of
the minimum energy [15].
2.4 Deep learning methods
Recently, the use of deep convolutional neural networks in the field of image and signal
processing has been growing exponentially [12, 59–61]. For this reason, this strategy has
also been used in image and video retargeting. One of these methods is to use the shift
map to retarget the input image to the output image [14]. Other methods used based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN) include methods [5, 53], and [6].

3 Dynamical system analysis
3.1 Information entropy
One of the ways to detect randomness property in a signal is to use entropy analysis. The
entropy was introduced in 1949 by Shannon for data communication and storage [51]. The
concept of entropy in physics is related to the degree of irregularity and uncertainty. The
entropy of a digital image is the randomized estimate that is used to measure the sharpness
of the histogram peaks. The entropy rate of a digital image is defined by
H(m) =
2n−1

i=0
P(mi)Log2
1
P(mi)
(12)
Where the probability of value mi is shown by P(mi) and N −1 is the number of gray
value. If the entropy is 8, a completely random image is created
3.2 Maximal Lyapunov exponent
In the analysis of time series, the presence of a positive Lyapunov exponent indicates the
phenomenon of chaos in a time series [31]. The first method for calculating Lyapunov expo-
nent of a time series was proposed by Wolf in 1985 [58]. There are many computational
errors in using this algorithm to obtain the Lyapunov exponent. For this reason, other meth-
ods use deterministic dynamical approximation. In this section, the algorithm proposed by
Rosenstein [43] and Kantz [30] is discussed. These methods use exponential divergence in
closely related trajectories to calculate Lyapunov exponent.
A point, such as sn0, is chosen in the time series space, and all neighborhoods distance
less than ϵ are considered. The mean distances of all neighborhoods from this point are
calculated in phase space, and the logarithm of this mean distance at timeΔn will contain
all deterministic fluctuations in the dynamical system. For all reference points in phase
space (n0), the effective expansion rate fluctuations in the mean state will be calculated. The
mathematical equation of this model is as follows:
S(Δn) = 1
N
N

n0=1
ln
⎛
⎝
1
| υ(Sn0) |

Sn∈υ(Sn0)
| Sn0+Δn −Sn+Δn |
⎞
⎠.
(13)
Where Sn0 in this equation represents the reference point in the phase vector and υ(Sn0) is
the neighborhood of Sn0 with distance ε. It should be noted that Sn0 is the last element of
Sn0 and Sn0+Δn is the outside time when covered by the delay vector Sn0. In this equation,
the neighborhood size should be assumed to be as small as possible.
4 Proposed method
This section shows the details of the proposed algorithm. Figure 1 shows the block diagram
of the proposed algorithm. The details of each part of the algorithm will be described in the
next subsections. The mathematical symbols used in each of the Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 are
shown in Table 1.

4.1 Proposed entropy importance map
The process of calculating the entropy energy can be described in the following steps:
–
Step 1 : First, the color image of the RGB format is converted to YCbCr format, and
the Y channel is selected to compute the entropy energy.
–
Step 2 : The size of the neighborhood window (W) for the difference between the
neighborhood values with central pixel (Y(i,j)) is entered through the input.
–
Step 3 : To the length of the W window, padding operation is done on the Y channel.
–
Step 4 : A W × W-sized block with pixel center of (i, j) is selected. The difference
of all pixels in this window is calculated with the central pixel and its absolute value is
stored in the Block variable.
Block = ABS(Y(i −WSize : i + WSize, j −WSize : j + WSize) −Y(i, j)) (14)
–
Step 5 : The entropy of the Block array is calculated using (12).
–
Step 6 : The entropy calculated is normalized by the following equation:
Enew = Eold −mn
mx −mn
(15)
In this equation, mx and mn refer to the maximum and minimum values of the block
variable, respectively.
–
Step 6 : The calculated entropy is stored at the pixel location E(i, j).
Finally, the calculated E-array will be used as the entropy energy in other parts of the
algorithm. The pseudocode of this process is shown in Algorithm 1.

4.2 Threshold calculation
This part of the proposed algorithm calculates an acceptable threshold based on the selected
seam rate. In this process, a time series is created based on each column of the important map
and the Lyapunov exponent is calculated for each column seam. The calculated Lyapunov
exponent for the importance map columns is ascended and the Lyapunov threshold (LT) is
calculated based on the selected seam rates. See Algorithm 2 for a better understanding of
the details of this process.
4.3 Selecting of optimal seams
This part of the algorithm is, in fact, the main part of the optimal seam selection process
based on dynamical system analysis. In this method, a columnar scanning on the importance
map (E) is performed. The scanning process starts from a column in the first row and similar
to basic seam carving. For each cell in the importance map, there are three adjacent cells
in the next row, in which the minimum value will be selected. When the selection process
reaches the last row of the matrix, all selected values are stored in a one-dimensional array.
For this stored array, the Lyapunov exponent is calculated, and if this value is less than
the threshold, it can be said that the selected seam is an optimal seam. Optimal seams are
applied to the final image by incremental or decremental process. The full process of this
algorithm is shown as pseudo-code in Algorithm 3.

5 Experimental results
In evaluating the performance of the proposed method, two methods have been used: (1)
collecting of opinions from 20 volunteers on the results of various image resizing meth-
ods based on the MSRA-10k dataset and analyzing these comments as objective analysis,
and (2) Using the aspect ratio Similarity criterion based on the RetargetMe dataset. In the
following section, each of the above analysis will be examined in detail.
5.1 MSRA dataset
In this paper, 1000 images from the MSRA-10K dataset are randomly selected and the
proposed algorithm is applied [39]. Initially, you can see Fig. 2 to show the proposed impor-
tance map based on the entropy analysis. In this image, the outputs are clearly depicted
based on the variation in the selected window (W). As the window size, the edges of the
image have become more clearly distinguished from the background. Figure 3 is also illus-
trated to better understand Lyapunov exponent of three different seams in a sample image.

19428
Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417–19440

Based on the results of these three seams, the blue seam with a smaller Lyapunov value
would be a better choice than the other two seams for an optimal seam selection. Figure 4
shows the results of applying different threshold values on a sample image.
Also, Fig. 5 shows the results of the algorithm on the rose image of the MSRA-10K
dataset. A resizing rate of 25% is assumed and column seams are also used in this image.
The reduced and enlarged image is displayed in a sample image with 300 × 400 pixels by
100 column seam selection.
For a better understanding of the proposed algorithm, 16 samples of datasets were
selected and shown at a 25% selection rate in Fig. 6. Visual analysis of these images shows
that the important details of the images are well preserved. On the other hand, the results
obtained from the proposed algorithm do not show the existence of artifact regions of the
resized images.

5.1.1 Region of interest
In the proposed method, the region of interest (ROI) in an image can be considered as
desired, and the proposed algorithm can completely delete this area or make no changes to
it. Figure 7 shows the results of the implementation of the algorithm on these ROIs.
5.1.2 Loop eﬀect
The proposed algorithm can be implemented on an image as a loop or recurrent form. In
this method, the output image from the previous step can be considered as the input of the
next step. Figure 8 shows the results obtained from this method on a sample image.
5.1.3 Comparison and discussion
In this section, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, this algorithm is com-
pared with the improved seam carving [44] and sparse seam carving [13] algorithms. Matlab
2017a was used for simulation and comparison. Figure 9 shows the results of the output
of the proposed algorithm with the other methods on the car image. This image has a lot
of complexity in the background. Figure 9(a , b) shows that the results from the other two
algorithms have distortions and artifact regions created in the car object. As shown in this
illustration, the proposed method is free of artifact regions and less distortion than other
methods.
To further evaluate the performance of the algorithms, all three algorithms were applied
to the MSRA-10k dataset and the results of these selected images are shown in Fig. 10.
Of course, the images selected in Fig. 10 have been attempted to be more complex than
those selected in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the salient detection algorithm is not used to
simulate all three methods. Based on the results from Fig. 10, the simulated samples show
that the proposed method works better than the other method in more complex images. In
Fig. 1, the most important object is the bell image, which is cropped by two other methods
(Fig. 10(a4−7)), while it is well preserved by the proposed method (See Fig. 10(a2−3)).

Figure 10(b) shows a boy with a bow, which is the most important object in the picture,
and the proposed method works better than the other two methods and no distortion is seen
in the resulting image. It is also clearly seen in Fig. 10(c) that roadside signs are the most
important image objects and the results show that these objects are well preserved in the
proposed method and are not destroyed. Parts of the squirrel’s body in Fig. 10(d) have been
destroyed by two other methods, while the proposed method has performed better. The
image of the boat in Fig. 10(e), as a complex example, can show the performance of the
proposed method over the other two methods. Finally, the results from the bridge image in
Fig. 10(f) shows that the proposed method has less distortion than the other methods in the
bridge fences.
In addition to visual analysis, this paper also uses quantitative analysis to compare algo-
rithms. For this purpose, 20 volunteers were invited to study the results of all three methods.

Also, 100 images were selected from the dataset and divided into two simple and complex
groups based on the similarity of the existing object and the background of the image. In
fact, more complex images have less similarity between the object and the background of
the image. In this analysis, volunteers were asked to choose their best preference for resized
images. Table 2 presents the results of the poll based on the volunteers preferred rate for
each method. Based on the results of this table, the proposed method performs better in high
complexity images than other methods.

5.2 RetargetMe dataset
The RetargetMe database contains 80 images, developed in 2010 by Rubinstein and col-
leagues at MIT [46, 47]. Each image has 8 retargeting methods including CR [47], MOP
[45], SC [44], SCL [47], SM [42], SNS [57], SV [33] and WARP [57]. These images are
selected based on various subsets of lines/edges, people/faces, foreground objects, textures,
symmetries, and geometric structures. In this paper, the images of this dataset are used to
evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results obtained from the proposed
method are shown in Fig. 11 on some samples of images in this data set. In the continua-
tion of this section, a new criterion will be introduced, which has been used to measure the
performance of the proposed method.
5.2.1 Aspect Ratio Similarity (ARS)
This criterion was proposed by Zhang et al. In 2016 based on the creation of transformed
networks that can integrate forward sampling [68]. In fact, ARS is an estimate of the geo-
metric transition to calculate the relationship between two images. In this method, the visual
quality of a local block is evaluated with a collection strategy. The ARS criteria measures
of similarity based on (16). The maximum width and height (Wrt and Hrt) in the block
are used to calculate the ratio of change in width (Rw = Wrt
N ) and height (Rh = Hrt
N ), and
the average ratio (μr = Rw+Rh
2
) is used to express the change in block size. Finally, the
similarity score between the two blocks can be calculated based on the following equation:
SAR = 2RwRh + C
R2w + R2
h + C × e−α(μr−1)

5.2.2 Results of comparisons based on ASR
In this section, 37 images from the RetargetMe dataset have been selected to evaluate
the performance of the proposed method based on ARS criteria. The results are shown
in Table 3. Also in this table, the proposed method is compared with 8 classical methods
CR [47], MOP [45], SC [44], SCL [47], SM [42], SNS [57], SV [33] and WARP [57]. In
addition to the continuous method conJND [15], several deep learning methods including
CarvingNet [53], DeepIR [36], and Cycle-IR [54] are also shown for comparison in this
table. The comparison results based on the mean of ARS for 37 selected images show that
the proposed method has better performance than some methods, but methods conJND and
CarvingNet have better performance than the proposed method.
Figure 12 also shows the results of the visual analysis of these comparisons for the four
sample images.
5.3 Discussion
The results of visual analysis and quantitative analysis show that the proposed algorithm
can be used as a practical task. Of course, there are still drawbacks. One of the drawbacks
of seam carving methods is their low execution speed. Also, using salient object detection
techniques can increase the performance accuracy of this algorithm. For this reason, in
future work, the study of increasing the execution speed and accuracy of the algorithm
through deep learning methods can fill this gap. This algorithm can also be commonly used
in many other media, such as video and audio, with changes in its nature.
6 Conclusions and future works
Over the past two decades, the use of content-based image resizing techniques has made
significant progress and has been a favorite of many image processing researchers. In the
seam carving techniques, the use of a high-performance significance map can increase the
accuracy of this algorithm. For this reason, in this paper, a new entropy-based significance
map is proposed to resize the image in the seam carving algorithm. In fact, the main content
of this paper is the use of dynamical systems analysis theory, which uses the most important
process of dynamic systems analysis, the Lyapunov exponent, to search for optimal seams.
To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, two standard datasets were used and
the results were presented as visual analysis and quantitative analysis based on standard
criteria. For visual analysis, the proposed method and other methods were evaluated with
user feedback and the results showed that Based on the statistics obtained from users, the
proposed method has been satisfied by users. The aspect ratio similarity criterion was also
used for quantitative analysis and the simulation results showed that the performance of the
proposed algorithm performed better than other methods. In future work, attempts will be
made to identify the salient regions of the image using machine learning algorithms such as
deep learning to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
