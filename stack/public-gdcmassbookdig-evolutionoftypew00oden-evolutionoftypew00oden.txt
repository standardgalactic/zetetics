FOREWORD
The contents of this book give the steps in the evolution
of the typewriter, and are the result of observation, study,
and
conviction.
The
purpose
is
to answer
in
as
concise
form as possible the many inquiries received with reference
to the
history
of
the
typewriter.
However,
this book
is
not to be considered
in any sense a history,
for the reason
that many typewriters have been invented and many mar-
keted that are not mentioned.
Those omitted have
not,
in
the author's judgment, contributed
either mechanical
prin-
ciples
or
educational
assistance
that would promote
type-
writer
development.
On
the
other
hand,
consideration
is
given
some
machines
only
because
they
have
suggested
principles or
ideas that have served
to
assist other manu-
facturers
; and others, from the fact that they received more
or less recognition from the public.
Practically
unlimited
numbers
of
patents
have
been
issued
on
typewriters
and
accessories,
but
to
enumerate
them would require volumes, from which
it would be
diffi-
cult to assort and assimilate information of value.
The
author
gratefully
acknowledges
having
drawn
from many sources
in
the preparation
of
this work,
prin-
cipal among which are:
Patent Records, Office Appliances,
Typewriter
Topics,
Phonographic World,
History
of
the
Typewriter,
the
Franklin
Institute,
Mr.
C.
D.
Rice,
and
Mr.
Charles
E.
Smith,
author
of "A
Practical
Course
in
Touch Typewriting."
Having sold the
first model of the
first practical type-
writer, however, the facts contained in this book are based
chiefly upon the author's personal
experience, gained dur-
ing a period of more than a
third of a century of contin-
uous
service
in
the
typewriter
business,
and
he
has
not
hesitated
to express
facts as he
sees them.
The Author.


BUSINESS EVOLUTION
The
development
of
the
typewriter
industry
is
so
closely
interwoven
with
the
history
of
modern
progress
that
it
is
impossible
to
separate them.
In
fact,
the
type-
writer
is
responsible
for much of the remarkable progress
of the world during the last
four decades.
For this reason,
a synopsis of
its development should be interesting to every
intelligent, progressive thinker.
The fundamental
purpose
of
the
typewriter
is
to
en-
able
the
typist,
or
operator,
to do more and
better work
with
less effort
in a given time than cm be done with the
pen,
and
the
value
of
the
typewriter
is measured
by
the
extent to which
it
increases speed and
legibility
in making
records or preparing messages for delivery.
It would be
difficult
for
the present
generation,
with-
out
reference
to
history
or
the
experience
of
others,
to
comprehend
the evolution
in
social,
educational,
industrial,
and commercial progress during the
last
half century.
The
telegraph,
the
telephone,
the
wireless,
the
aeroplane, and
the
wonderful
developments
in
steam
and
electrical
con-
veyances have brought the nations of the earth
into
closer
communication with each other, and the typewriter has be-
come
an
absolute
necessity
for
the
preservation
of
the
records of such communication.
Telegraph and telephone messages must be confirmed
in
writing
for
future
reference and
record
to
avoid
mis-

understanding, and
this easy means
of communication has
greatly stimulated
the development
of
transportation.
As
evidence of these facts there
is no business interest worthy
of
note
today
that
has
not
from
one
to many
thousand
typewriters
in use.
For example, the Western Union Tele-
graph Company, whose mission
it
is to give the best possi-
ble
service, both
in speed and accuracy,
in the
receipt and
delivery
of
messages,
purchased
in
a
single
order
ten
thousand Underwood
typewriters, and
a
repeat
order
for
several thousand indicates satisfactory service.
The
development
of
communication
in
its
various
stages, with
the express purpose
of saving
time,
is
inter-
esting.
In
the
days
of
King
Henry
VIII,
before
the
telegraph,
the
telephone,
and
the
typewriter,
official com-
munications were
transmitted by messenger
with
instruc-
tions
to "Haste, post Haste!
Haste for thy
life!", and the
penalty on account
of delay was
death.
Hence
it
will be
seen that the proper appreciation of the value of time has
been, and
is, the foundation of progress.
The penalty
for
delay or the waste of time now, as then,
is death
; not, how-
ever, to the individual but to his business.
The typewriter has revolutionized commercial methods.
It
lessens
labor,
at
the
same
time
increases
it.
It
has
supplanted the pen
in commercial
correspondence,
because
it has greater speed, accuracy, and
legibility.
It magnifies
and
intensifies mistakes
in
spelling,
punctuation, and
cap-
italization, and
as
a
result,
leads
to
their
correction.
It
stimulates
accuracy
by
encouraging
greater
attention
to
detail, both on the part of the dictator and the
typist.
The
typewriter has done more to promote the phenomenal busi-
ness expansion
during
recent
years than any
other
office
appliance.
Indeed, it has made most of the modern office appli-
ances necessary, as well as possible.
The typewriter has developed the ability and increased
the
capacity
of
the
business man,
the
professional man

the
thinking man
in
all
lines
of endeavor—to
deliver
his
message.
In
fact,
every
man
who
contributes
to
the
progress
of
the
world,
or who promotes
its
social,
indus-
trial, and commercial
interests
in any way, through com-
munication
with
his
fellow man,
is
benefited by
the
type-
writer.
Today
it is possible to record thought almost as rapidly
as
it
formulates,
and
the busy
business man
can
dictate
MEASURING TIME
As compared with the second-hand of the watch the typebar of
the typewriter moves eleven times
faster.
This was demonstrated by
Miss Margaret B. Owen, in actual work, in winning the World's Type-
writing Championship.
Miss Owen struck the keys more than eleven
strokes a second for three thousand six hundred consecutive seconds.

more in one hour than he could formerly write
in a whole
day's
time.
In
fact,
in
the days
of
the pen-written
letter
it
was
necessary
to
sacrifice
clearness
and
exactness
of
thought and expression in order to conserve time and labor.
Today
the typewriter has
released
the
business man from
these
restrictions
and
limitations,
and
has
given
him
a
mental
freedom
that
enables him
to
produce
the
highest
and most
efficient
results.
The typewriter provides
facili-
ties which
enable
the
business man
to
think
quicker and
better, and being relieved of the physical labor in recording
his
thoughts,
he
has much
more
time
to
devote
to
the
development of new ideas
in the expansion of his business.
It was Bacon who
said ''Reading maketh
a
full man,
conference a ready man, and writing an exact man."
TYPEWRITER EVOLUTION
Authentic
records show
that
the germ
of
typewriter
genius
first manifested
itself more than two hundred years
ago when
in the year
17 14 Henry
Mill, an English
engi-
neer,
patented
a
writing machine which he
said he "had
brought to perfection at great paines and expense"; yet
it
was more than a century and a half thereafter before the
first practical typewriter was
built, and the development of
genius and public opinion began to get together.
No model
showing the mechanical construction,
or descriptive matter
concerning the principle involved
in
this machine,
is
avail-
able.
However, during the period between the
first recorded
idea and
the
first
practical
results
of
a
writing machine,
many
futile
efforts were made
to produce
a
commercially
practicable machine, as the following steps show.
In 1784 an embossing machine was invented in France
for
the
benefit
of
the
blind.
It
served
its purpose
in
the
process of evolution, as
all intermediate efforts
did, but
its

scope was
limited
quite
as much
as
its
practicability, and
as a
result
it received no commercial
recognition.
In
1829 Mr.
Burt,
of
Detroit,
Mich.,
invented
and
patented a machine which he called a "typographer."
The
merits
of
this
invention
were
of
such
minor
importance
that
the machine made
little impression upon
the business
world.
Unfortunately,
all
original
descriptive
matter,
records,
etc., concerning
this machine were destroyed by a
fire
in the Patent Office at Washington
in
1836.
Only the
original drawing, presented herewith, was preserved.
BURT
In
1830 M.
X.
Progin,
Marseilles,
France,
took
out
patent papers for a machine which he called a "typographic
machine or pen."
It embodied
the
first
principles, though

10
crudely,
of
the
typebar
idea.
In
1836
another
French
machine was
brought
out
with
no
greater
success.
The
following
is
a diagram
showing
the
typebars
of
Progin's
machine.
PROGIN
THB FIRST IDEA OF A TYPEBAR
In
1843-5 Charles Thurber, of Worcester, Mass.,
built
a machine
that
did
actual
work.
. This was
a
type-wheel
machine, and
it suggested the
first principle of the movable
carriage.
It was very slow;
its
principle and construction
were
crude; and
the
business
public was
not
enlightened
concerning the value
of
a writing machine, hence
its
fail-
ure.
THURBER
THE FIRST MOVABLE CARRIAGE

II
In 1844 a man by name of
Littledale, an Englishman,
invented
an
embossing
machine
for
the
blind.
In
this
machine
provision was
also made
for
the
use
of
carbon,
which was inserted
in the usual way, and while writing an
embossed copy for the blind, a carbon impression was
also
made
for those
less unfortunate.
In 1845 a machine was brought out by Dr.
Leavitt. of
Kentucky.
There
is
no
evidence
that
this machine was
practical and
it
evidently was
not,
from
the
fact
that
it
soon passed out of existence.
During
the
intervening
years,
1847-56,
a number
of
models of a machine was invented by Alfred
E.
Beach, an
American,
editor
of
the
Scientific American.
From
this
machine we get
the
first
idea
of the "key stem"
or
finger
key,
bell
crank, connecting
wire, and universal bar
princi-
ple.
The
typebars
also
converged
to
a common
center.
However,
the purpose
of
this machine was
not
for
type-
writing
as
it
is
understood
today;
the
invention was
in-
tended only for making embossed impressions on
a narrow
tape.
The following illustration shows a section of Beach's
machine, and the application
of his advanced
ideas.

BEACH
EMBODYING MANY NEW IDEAS.
In
1848
a
machine
was
invented
by
Fairbank,
not,
however, with the view of typewriting, but to print designs
in
colors on
calico or
fabric.
This machine was patented
for
"printing
purposes," which
is
the only
reason why
it
is given place here.

12
In
1849
Pierre
Foucauld,
a
blind
man,
invented
a
machine
for
those
similarly
affected.
This
machine was
exhibited
in
Paris, where
it
attracted
considerable
atten-
tion and was awarded
a
Gold
Medal.
A number
of
the
machines was manufactured, but
the purpose
for which
it
was
intended
necessarily
limited
the demand;
as
a
result
its
success was of short duration.
FOUCAULD
In 1850 a machine was invented by Mr. Eddy.
It had
seventy-eight
type arranged
in
six rows
of
thirteen
each.
This was
in
reality
a
typewriter,
but
for
reasons
which
records do not explain, the machine did not get beyond the
experimental
stage.
In
1 850- 1
Sir Charles Wheatstone,
considered one
of
the
greatest
scientists and
inventors
of
his
day, was
ex-
perimenting with
a machine
for
the purpose
of recording
the
messages from
his
dial
telegraph,
another
of
his
in-
ventions.
This
machine
possessed
very
little
merit,
and
while records show that Sir Charles made further attempts
between 1855 and
i860, none of his
efforts possessed
suffi-
cient merit to do credit to his reputation as an inventor.

13
RDDY
At
about
this
period
a machine was brought
out by
Marchesi
and
another
by
a
Mr.
Hughes.
The
latter
machine was
the more
effective
of
the
two,
but
it went
the way
of
the many,
serving
only
the purpose
of
those
who
fail
in
their
efforts through honest endeavor,
leaving
an experience by which others may
profit.
In
1852 patents were
issued
to John
Jones,
of
Clyde,
New
York,
for
a
writing machine,
called
a
"Mechanical
Typographer," and although
the
inventor had
the
benefit
of former experiments,
his machine lacked
practical value
and failed to produce the desired results.

In 1854 Thomas, an American, invented a machine of
such
little value, except to suggest a locking device for the
type-wheel machines
of
a
later
day,
that
it
is
hardly
en-
titled
to
space
here.
It
consisted
chiefly
of
characters
carved
on
a
rolling
pin,
with
other
equally
crude
ideas.

EMBODYING FIRST TYPE-LOCKING DEVICE.
However,
since
it embodied an idea that was used by later
and more
successful inventors,
it has been recognized.
^
COOPER

In 1856 a machine was
invented by Cooper
that had
a
type-wheel
acting on
a
vertical
axis.
This
anticipated
very
closely
the
invention
of
Mr. Hammond,
which
has
met
with
such
success
that
it
still
has some
considerable
following.
In
1857 Dr. William Francis,
of New York, made an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
build
a
typewriter.
The machine
was
a
failure
because
the
typebar
action was
so
compli-
cated and
heavy;
nevertheless
it
embodied
features
from
which
later inventors have
profited, among which was
the
principle of the type-guide.
FRANCIS
EMPLOYED KIRST PRINCIPLE OF TYPE-GUIDE
In
1 86 1 -7 Thomas
Hall,
of New York,
invented and
constructed
a
typebar
machine.
This
machine
embodied
many of
the
essential
features
of
the writing machines
in
use
today,
but
it was
never
offered
for
sale.
Mr.
Hall
later directed his attention to the construction of a machine,
which he did place on the market
in about the year
1880.
This machine was known
as
the Hall
typewriter, and em-
bodied
the pantograph
principle,
operated
with
one hand
by means of a
stylus.
This machine could be worked at a
surprising
speed,
considering
the
one-hand
method
by
which
it was necessary
to operate
it.
A number
of these machines were manufactured
at a
profit,
it
is
said.
If
this
is
true,
the
Hall was
doubtless

16
the
first
typewriter
to
reach
this
point
of
progress.
The
one-hand
stylus
principle, however, was
wrong-;
its opera
tion
was
slow,
and
as
a
result
the
machine
was
soon
succeeded
by
others
that
embodied
principles
which
con
tributed to greater speed and accuracy, many
of which are
in use today.
HALl,
STYLOGRAPH1C MACHINE
In 1865 George House, of Buffalo. Xew York, brought
out a machine in which the type were arranged
in a basket.
striking the paper
at a common
center.
By reason of
this
fact his machine marked a
distinct step
in the development
HOUSE

17
of
typewriter
genius,
but
its
value
consisted
solely
in
its
contribution to other inventors.
Jn
1868
John
Pratt,
of
Alabama,
was
fortunate
in
bringing out a machine at about the time the press had be-
come
greatly
interested
in
the
efforts
to produce
a
type-
writer.
The London papers commented upon the feasibility
and
the value
of
a machine which would produce writing
by mechanical means.
The Scientific American, comment-
ing
directly upon
Mr.
Pratt's
production,
refers
to
it
as
follows:
"It
is assumed that a man may print his thoughts twice
as
fast
as he can
write them, and with
the advantage
of
the
legibility,
compactness, and
neatness
of
print
The subject of typewriting
is one of the interesting aspects
of the near future.
Its manifest
feasibility and advantage
indicate that the laborious and unsatisfactory performance
of the pen must, sooner or
later, become obsolete for gen-
eral purposes."
The
Phonographic
World
later
published
an
article
describing Mr.
Pratt's machine
in
detail.
Mr.
Pratt's machine was
soon numbered among
the
many failures that had preceded
it.
However, he took out
patents
on
another
machine
in
1882,
which
he
sold
to
James
B.- Hammond, who incorporated them
in
a machine
which will receive due mention.
BROOKS
FIRST IDEA OK TWO CHARACTERS ON EACH TYPEBAR

18
Byron A. Brooks, who had rendered extensive
service
in the development of typewriters, promoted the
first prin-
ciple of placing two characters on each typebar; this neces-
sitated a lower and an upper case which was operated by
a
shift key, a principle employed
in the most popular type-
writers of today.
Mr. Brooks later invented a machine to which he gave
his name, and as an indication of his far-sighted knowledge
of
the
ultimate
demands
of
the
typewriter
industry,
he
attempted
to
produce
visible
writing.
But
his
efforts
in
this direction were unsatisfactory because only two lines of
writing were visible at one time.
They did, however, serve
as suggestions to assist later inventors.
The typebars stood
up back of the platen and
struck forward and downward.
The machine had no special features to commend
it to pub-
lic opinion, and as
a
result
its manufacture was soon
dis-
continued.
The foregoing were experimental steps in the progress
or evolution of ideas
in the development of the typewriter.
These experiments were being conducted on both
sides
of
the
Atlantic.
In
fact,
it might appear
that
there was
a
contest
for
priority
in
the production
of
the
first practical
writing
machine,
in
which
America
won,
as
subsequent
developments will show
. Although all these steps were
fail-
ures,
so far as individual
practical
results were concerned,
they were valuable to succeeding inventors who culled and
preserved the practical and eliminated the impractical.
For example:
M.
X.
Progin,
in
1830, advanced
the
first
principle
of
the
typebar.
From
Charles Thurber we
get
the
first
idea
of
a movable
carriage, embodied
in
his
patents of 1843-5.
To Alfred E. Beach we are indebted for
the first ideas of the finger key, bell crank, connecting wire,
and universal bar,
also the converging of the typebars
to-
ward a common
center.
Thomas
is credited with
the
first

19
idea concerning a locking device.
The machine invented by
Cooper
in
1856 gives the
first type-wheel device acting on
a
vertical
axis.
Dr. Wm.
Francis
originated
the
type-
guide.
From
the
invention
of George House,
of
Buffalo,
we
get
the
first
idea
of arranging
the
type
in
a
basket.
And
to Byron A.
Brooks
is given
credit
for
placing two
characters on each key—an upper and lower
case—which
necessitated
a
shift key
for
capitals and
other upper
case
characters.
About the year
1865,
C. Latham
Sholes,
a
printer
in
Milwaukee, began experimenting with a machine for insert-
ing the numbers of pages in books.
This machine attained
such
a marked degree
of
success
that Mr.
Sholes, having
studied
the comments
of
influential mechanical
experts
in
magazines concerning
the
universal and
practical demand
for
a
typewriter,
and
believing
in
its
possibility,
be-
came
interested
in
extending
his
ideas
to
the
develop-
ment
of a writing machine.
With
this
object
in
view,
in
1867 he associated with himself Carlos Glidden and Samuel
W.
Soule.
In 1868 they were granted patent papers for a
machine, which although very crude, embodied such practi-

EARLY EFFORT SHOWING PIANOFORTE KEYBOARD.
cal ideas that
it attracted the attention of James Densmore,
a
wealthy
inventor
of
Meadville,
Pa.,
who,
upon
paying

20
all
of
the
expenses
incurred
in
all
previous
experiments,
secured one-fourth
interest
in
the
invention.
Soon
after,
Glidden and Soule dropped out of the enterprise.
Mr. Densmore
first saw the machine
in
1868, and im-
mediately pronounced it a failure in
its state of development
at that
time,
at
least
so
far
as
its
practicability was
con-
cerned.
However, he believed that the ideas and principles
of the machine were correct, and at once began the process
of elimination and development.
Many models were made,
all of which were rejected as impractical after having been
thoroughly
tested
by
those
who
were
in
a
position
to
understand the requirements of a practical writing machine.
These numerous
failures
discouraged Mr.
Sholes,
but
he
was urged by Mr. Densmore
to continue
his experiments.
Mr. Densmore
insisted that
it was absolutely necessary
to
the ultimate success of the machine to have interested out-
siders
point
out
the
defects
and
suggest
wherein
the
machine might be
improved.
Owing
to
the most
limited
manufacturing
facilities
at
their command,
these machines
were
so
extremely
crude
in workmanship
that
they
con-
tained
little
suggestion
of
the
possibilities
of
the
present-
day
typewriter.
It was not
until
the year
1870
that
the
machine began to give promise of real service.
The actual
value
of
the machine up
to
this
time,
however,
consisted
chiefly in confirming the confidence of
its inventors.
About
this time
G. W.
N. Yost became
interested
in
the
enterprise, and
suggested
further
alterations and
im-
provements.
Mr. Yost's efforts, however, were most effect-
ive through
his
influence
in convincing
his
associates
that
the machine must be made
in
the most
skilful manner,
if
it was
ever
to
attain
a high
degree
of
profitable
service.
With
this object
in view, Mr.
Sholes, Mr. Densmore, Mr.
Yost, and others, sought and secured the attention and
in-
terest of E. Remington & Sons (the Remington Arms Com-
pany),
of
Ilion, New
York.
This company had
attained
quite an extensive reputation
for mechanical
skill through

the manufacture of firearms during the late Civil War, and
was doubtless better equipped for the quality of work neces-
sary to build a serviceable typewriter than any other com-
pany at that time.
The first machine, therefore, that would
really do practical writing was due to the original ideas of
Mr.
Sholes,
the judgment and perseverance
of Mr. Dens-
more, and the influence of Mr. Yost.
To
Mr.
Sholes
is
also
due
the
arrangement
of
the
keyboard.
He was a printer by profession, and
it has been
said that the order of the printers' case evidently suggested
the arrangement of many of the seventy-six characters on
the original machine.
Although some minor changes have
been made,
the present keyboard
is
substantially
the same
as the
original.
There are many who
feel
that
a
revised
keyboard would be beneficial, and efforts have been made to
produce one more satisfactory to
all.
These attempts, how-
ever, have always proved an expensive undertaking without
satisfactory results, because time has made the present key-
board
practically
universal,
a
fact
for which, the
typist
is
largely responsible.
A contract was given to E. Remington & Sons for the
manufacture
of
a
thousand machines,
then known
as
the
Sholes and Glidden typewriter.

It conveys
little information to reproduce the preceding
diagrams
of
the
earlier
efforts
in
typewriter
construction,
as they would hardly be recognized as typewriters.
Their
only
value
consisted
in
contributing
to
the
steps
in
the
evolution of the typewriter by way of suggestion.
E. Rem-
ington &
Sons
later
secured
control
of
the machine and
gave
it the name "Remington."

In
18/4
the
first Aro.
1 model Remington was placed
on
the
market,
of which about 400 were
sold.
Many
of
these machines were
returned, not only on
account
of
im-
perfections they developed, but because the business world
had not yet given the typewriter serious consideration.
FIRST REMINGTON
NO. 1 MODEL
The Western
Electric Company became
the
first
sales
agent
for
the
Remington,
but
their
efforts were
not
suc-
cessful and
the agency was
transferred
to
the
Fairbanks
Scale Company
in
1878.
The
Scale Company met
with

23
no greater success than the Western Electric Company, for
the
reason
as
stated
before,
the
public were not educated
to the value of a typewriter, and the efforts of the agencies
were otherwise more profitably directed.
It may be
of
interest
to know
that about
this time a
legal sham
battle between
typewriter
inventors was
insti-
gated
for
the purpose
of
directing public attention
to
the
importance
the
typewriter
had
gained
in
the
commercial
world,
in which
suits and
countersuits
were
brought,
all
of which were settled out of court "by agreement of coun-
sel."
The
suits were only
intended
to
agitate an
interest
in
the
typewriter, which had not thus
far been
very
suc-
cessful.
In
1882,
the
firm
of
Wyckoff,
Seamans &
Benedict
was organized
for
the purpose
of devoting
its
entire time
and energy to the sale of the machine.
The firm consisted
of W.
O.
Wyckoff,
a
Court
Reporter
of
Ithaca,
N.
Y.
;
C. W.
Seamans,
who
had
been
Sales
Manager
of
the
machine for Fairbanks and E. Remington & Sons since the
machine was
placed on
the market, and H.
H.
Benedict,
who had
long been
associated with
the Remington Arms
Company.
The next
step necessary
in
the
evolution
of the
type-
writer was
the
education
of
the
public
to
its commercial
value.
This was no
small undertaking because
of custom
and
prejudice.
A
typewritten
letter
often
offended
the
recipient, who seemed to
feel that
it was
a
reflection upon
his
intelligence
and
ability
to
read
pen
writing.
For
a
number of years the typewriter was looked upon as a lux-
ury used only by those who had
sufficient money to satisfy
a whim
; later
it became a convenience, and finally an abso-
lute necessity.
The campaign
of
education which
Mr. Seamans had
inaugurated during his former association with E. Reming-
ton & Sons was continued by the new
firm.
They believed

24
so thoroughly
in the future of the machine that
their
idea
was,
if
the
business man
did
not
appreciate
the
value
of
the machine
it
should be
taken
to him, and he
should be
taught
its use and
value.
With
this end
in
view,
several
hundred machines were placed in the offices of many prom-
inent
individuals and
firms,
such
as
editors,
authors,
law-
yers, and manufacturing- concerns, with the result that
the
firm's confidence was confirmed by the unqualified endorse-
ments of
all who had been thus favored.
Some of the endorsements secured by Mr. Seamans,
a
few of which are quoted below, were used by the new firm as
a foundation for the
further education of the public.

Gentlemen

Please

in
any

Please
do
not
even
divulge the
fact that
I own
a machine.
I have entirely stopped using
the Type-Writer for the reason that
I never could write a

it to anybody, without receiving a request by return mail that
I should
not
only
describe
the machine
but
state what
progress
I
had made
in the use of
it, etc.,

I do not like to write letters, and so
I do not
want people to know that
I own this curiosity-breeding little joker.
Yours truly.

(Mark Twain)
"Boston. March

Gentlemen
:
I have had one of your Type-Writers
for the
last ten
days, and
during this time
I have written with
it one hundred pages of a story
for the magazine under my charge,
all of the editorial matter for the
current number of
this publication, and a great many letters;
in
fact,
I have not used
a pen
since
the machine came
into my
possession.
After
this experience of ten days,
I
find that
I can
write,
with
this
apparatus, about two-thirds as
fast as
I can with a pen
; and though
I

25
am a rapid writer,
I confidently expect to be able to put more words
on
paper, before many
weeks, with
this machine,
than
I
ever
could
with a pen
in the same time. Writing with
it
is a very pleasant occu-
pation, while to me the use of the pen
is the merest drudgery.
I find
no
difficulty
in
'composing'
or doing any
of my
regular
literary
or
editorial work with the Type-Writer.
Very truly yours,
William T. Adams,
Editor of Oliver Optic's Magazine."
"Phenix, R.
I., March
28,
1875.
Gentlemen
:
We have now had the Type-Writer about
a month, and are en-
tirely
satisfied with
it.
There can be no doubt
in
regard
to
its use-
fulness.
When
I saw
the advertisement
of
the machine^ originally,
I had
little
faith in
it.
An examination surprised me, but not so much
as the practical working
has.
We have no trouble whatever with
it,
and
it
is almost constantly
in
operation.
I
think
that
it must
rank
with the great beneficial inventions of the century.
Very truly yours,
Henry Howard,
Governor of Rhode Island."
It may be well to direct attention
to a condition which
seemed to be absolutely necessary
at that time
in order to
break down the prejudice which seemed
to prevail against
the
"printed"
letter.
The
placing
of
these machines
"on
trial"
in
business
offices,
to demonstrate
their commercial
convenience,
established
the
"trial
habit"
which manufac-
turers have tried for years
in vain to eliminate.
The
"trial
habit"
is wholly unnecessary and
is an
expensive
imposi-
tion which the public
inflict upon the manufacturers, but
it
proves how tenaciously
habit
will
cling.
All
of
the
older
machines have been "tried" by millions, and
it would seem
today that a thorough demonstration and comparison of the

26
relative merits
of the various machines as adapted
to
the
buyer's business should be
sufficient.
The interests of E. Remington & Sons were so exten-
sive and varied and the success of the new
firm Wyckoff,
Seamans & Benedict had been
so marked that
in
1886 the
latter
purchased from
the Remington
firm
all
franchises,
patents, plant,
etc., used in the typewriter manufacture, and
started a separate manufacturing company.
Thus the type-
writer became
an
independent
enterprise
and
its
success
assured.
Thus
far
in
these
steps an
effort
has been made
to
place
the
various
attempts
to
produce
a
typewriter
in
chronological
order.
At
about
this
period,
however,
so
many inventors sought
to improve the primitive
ideas em-
ployed
in
the
first
Remington
production,
as
well
as
to
share in the profits, that a number of machines were placed
upon
the
market
almost
simultaneously.
Numerous
in-
ventors were engaged on various machines at the same time,
whose
products made
their
appearance
so
close
together
that
it would be practically impossible to give them chrono-
logical preference.
One of the difficult problems with which inventors were
confronted
at
that
time was
the
fact
that manufacturing
facilities
were
limited.
At
least,
these
facilities
had
not
been brought to that state of perfection necessary to build a
typewriter with the essential mechanical accuracy and with
sufficient speed and exactness of alignment and operation in
all of
its working parts to insure durability.
Those whose
experience dates back to the
first typewriter understand the
limitations
of mechanical
facilities
at
that
time, and
they
know that
the progress
in manufacturing has made
possi-
ble
refinements
necessary
to
the
evolution
of
the
type-
writer.
The characteristic features of the Sholes-Glidden prod-
uct, refined and improved by the Remington Company, rep-

27
resented the
simplest and most
effective form
of construc-
tion at that time.
The
first No.
i Remington was a
type-
bar
machine.
The
typebars hung
in
a
circle
and
were
attached
to
finger key
levers by connecting wires.
When
the
finger
key
levers
were
depressed
the
corresponding
typebars converged to a common center, striking the print-
ing
point
beneath
the
platen.
The
typebars
had
pivotal
bearings and were suspended from U-shaped hangers, held
in place by screws.
The possible loosening of these screws
and the wearing of the pivotal bearings affected the align-
ment very materially.
The
No.
i
model
Remington was
succeeded by
the
No.
4, each of which was a single case, non-shift machine;
that
is,
the
alphabet was
all
capitals.
The No.
2 was
a
double case machine, each typebar being provided with two
characters.
To
operate
the upper
case,
it was
necessary
to use one
of
the two
shift keys with which
the machine
was provided.
The No.
1 and No. 4 keyboards had four-
teen
less characters than the present keyboard.
The No. 3
model Remington was a wide carriage machine with eight
more
characters
than
the
No.
2
for
special
work.
The
No.
5 model had a
similar keyboard, but the
construction
and action of the machine were very heavy and as a result
met with
little success.
It reversed the
style
of operating
the escapement mechanism;
the rack working
in the dogs
instead of the dogs working in the rack.
The No. 6 model, which was
the most popular
blind
Remington, was
in
fact the successor
to the No.
2 model,
having
the
same
keyboard,
but many
improvements
and
refinements.
The No. 7 model was the same as the No. 6
with the exception
that
it had
eight more
characters,
the
same as the No.
3 keyboard.
The No. 6 and No.
7 Rem-
ingtons remained
the popular machines
for
years,
in
fact
until other inventors and manufacturers made
it necessary
to abandon that style of construction.

28
REMINGTON No.
6 (Blind)
The typebars of
all the various models of the Reming-
ton typewriter, except the No.
I and No.
4, were provided
with two characters
; the small letters and a few punctuation
marks were in the lower case; the capitals, the majority of
the punctuation marks, and
all
special
characters were
in
the upper case.
When operated
in
its normal
position the
machine wrote lower
case
characters, and
in order
to
get
upper case characters,
it was necessary to use the shift key.
For
this purpose two
shift keys were provided; one
in the
lower bank or row of keys on the
left
side, the other
in the
upper row on the
right.
These keys being out
of
line or
level with each other prevented
a
properly balanced hand
action, so essential
in touch typewriting.
The escapement
consisted of
a
rigid and
a
loose dog
which operated
in
a
rack.
Its construction was crude and
its action slow because of the carriage friction, and because
the universal bar which controlled
the escapement was be-
neath
the machine and operated by
the
finger key
levers.
The
ringer
key
levers were made
of wood.
These were
resilient and provided a
light touch, but they were suscep-
tible
to
climatic
conditions;
in
other
words
they
would

29
warp,
and
the
spacing was
irregular
between
the
finger
keys, which was not conducive
to accuracy
in touch
type-
writing.
The carriage traveled from right to
left, supported by
a way-rod
in
the back and
in
front by
a grooved
wheel
running on a
rod, around which were yoke blocks
directly
connected with the
shift key by means of which the upper
case was
controlled.
The carriage was drawn by a main-
spring, and when
it approached the end of the writing line
a bell gave the signal.
This signal was given several spaces
before the end of the
line, when the carriage was returned
by the
right hand,
at the same time giving new space
for
the
succeeding
line.
While
the
whole
principle and
con-
struction was crude,
it was undoubtedly the best machine of
that
style.
CALIGRAPH
Mr.
Yost,
having
severed
his
connection
with
the
Remington, began
experimenting
with
a
double keyboard
machine;
that
is,
a machine embodying
a
principle which
employed a character
for each key.
Mr. Yost secured the
service of Mr. Franz X. Wagner and a Mr. Burn,
skilled
mechanics who had been connected with the typewriter
in-
dustry since the original Sholes machine, and were employed
at
the Remington
factory
in
the
later development
of
the
Remington.
These experiments
resulted
in
the production
of
the Caligraph.
The advent of the Caligraph developed a difference of
opinion,
with
reference
to
the
advantages
of
the
single
(shift key)
and
the double keyboard.
The
principle
of
a
character for each key necessarily made the keyboard very
large.
The small
letters were on white keys
in the center
of
the
keyboard,
and
the
capitals
arranged
on
the
sides
with no regard for order or system.
There were two space
bars, one on each side of the keyboard.

30
The Caligraph employed
a
principle
in
the movement
of the carriage which never became popular.
The carriage
was not
pulled by
a mainspring
in
a
spring barrel, but
it
was moved by
a
cast metal arm attached
to
the center
of
the
carriage.
This arm
derived
its
power
from
a
long
spring
encircling an
iron
bar,
running from
the
front
to
the back of the machine beneath the finger key levers.
The
Caligraph also employed the principle of the single dog and
the double rack;
that
is.
it had one rigid dog operating
in
the racks.
One of the racks was loose and when a key was
depressed,
it moved forward the distance of the space of a
character, at which point
it engaged the dog, which stopped
the action of the carriage.
This
style of construction was
not a success, principally on account of the irregular spac-
ing caused by increased friction between the racks.
The
Caligraph
typebar system had
a
leverage
of
the
third order.
This caused
a difference
in
the depth
of
the
depression of the several banks of keys, resulting in irregu-
lar type impressions.
At the time
of
the invention
of
the
Caligraph the process of concaving the type was not known,
and to overcome this limitation
in manufacturing
facilities,
the circular platen of the Caligraph consisted of a series of
facets which provided
a
flat
surface for each
line
of writ-
ing.
CALIGRAPH
FIRST DOUBLE KEYBOARD MACHINE.

31
The
principles
employed
in
the
typebar and
the
car-
riage
return were
very
similar
to
those employed by
the
Remington.
This machine proved
a
strong competitor
of
the Remington for a number of years, and will be referred
to again
in the course of these
steps.
HAMMOND
Mr. James
B. Hammond,
a young man
possessed
of
unusual
ingenuity,
conceived
the
idea
of
building
a
type-
writer long before he had ever seen or heard of the Sholes-
Gliddcn
efforts.
He employed
an
entirely
different
prin-
ciple,
however,
namely,
the
type-wheel.
When
he saw
a
model of the Sholes-Glidden typewriter and reviewed
their
patent claims,
it
is said he was not in the least discouraged
but
rather
stimulated
to
greater
effort.
The
successful
operation
of
the
principle
involved
in
the Hammond was
very
difficult
to
attain.
The type-wheel,
or
shuttle, which
carried a
full font of type and
special characters, required
greater mechanical accuracy than did the typebar principle
as employed
at that time.
On
this feature alone, which
is
the
basic
principle
of
the Hammond,
the
inventor
spent
many years of patient
toil, before
it was brought to a state
of successful operation.
The Remington Company, having seen a model of the
Hammond machine during this period, invited the inventor
to visit Ilion with his machine for their inspection, with the
result that they tried for more than a year, without success,
to overcome
the
difficulties
with
which
the
inventor was
contending.
Mr. Hammond, possessing a spirit of perseverance, was
not discouraged by
the
failure
of the Remington, and
set
to work with renewed determination, which
resulted,
after
eight
years
of work,
in
accomplishing
his
aim.
He
pro-
duced a machine which embodied his ideas, and placed
it on
the market about the year 1884.

32
Each
type-wheel
of
the Hammond,
as
has
been
ex-
plained,
carried
a
full
font
of
type, which were
instantly
interchangeable.
That
is, one type-wheel, or
shuttle, might
be taken out and another inserted without affecting any of
the working parts of the machine.
This was the principle
for which Mr. Hammond had been
striving, and
it
is on
account
of
this
feature
that
the machine has been
able
to
hold
a
position
in
the
business
world,
although
its
outlet
is special and limited.
A Hammond type-wheel is made for
practically every known
language, which
accounts
for
its
sales being confined largely
to foreign
countries.
The Hammond,
however,
lacks many
necessary
fea-
tures
for
practical
commercial
service.
It
is
not
a good
manifolder, nor has
it the speed of a typebar machine, two
essential qualities highly necessary in the business world to-
day.
The
first Hammond
typewriter had
a
circular
key-
board with keys fashioned after the pianoforte.
This was
not popular.
The "ideal keyboard" was then
tried for the
reason that
its arrangement was more suitable to the opera-
tion
of
the
shuttle
feature
of
the machine.
It was
not
a
success.
At
present
a keyboard
is used
with
three
shift
keys;
two
for
capitals
and
some
special
characters,
one
located on each
side
of the keyboard;
the other
is
for
fig-
ures and other special characters.
None of these keyboards
has been satisfactory to the touch typist of the present day.
The touch of the Hammond typewriter
is uniform, so
also
is the typewritten impression, owing to the fact that a
depression
of
the key
simultaneously
turns
the
shuttle
to
the proper character and
releases a hammer which
strikes
the paper from the back, each time with equal
force.
The
alignment
is good, from the fact that the type do not strike
the paper direct; but the impression often has a blurred ap-
pearance.
The commercial world today, at least
the United
States, requires speed;
it requires a large number of copies
and the best possible results in every respect; hence the fact

33
HAMMOND
FIRST SUCCESSFUL TYPE-WHEEL MACHINE.
that the Hammond is
little used for commercial purposes
in
the United States.
It occupies a special
field.
BAR-LOCK
The Bar-Lock
is
the
invention
of
Charles
Spiro,
of
New York.
Mr. Spiro is also the inventor of the Columbia,
but
it cannot be said that the Bar-Lock
is the outgrowth of
the Columbia from the fact that these two machines have no
similarity whatsoever.
The Columbia was a disc or wheel
machine and was little more than a toy, while the Bar-Lock is
a typebar machine, possessing
sufficient merit
to
justify
its
continued manufacture.
The
Bar-Lock
is
the
first
"duplicate"
keyboard
machine.
That
is,
it is the first machine with a key for each
character, having the capitals arranged above the small
let-
ters in the same general order.
It
is also the
first machine
to be built with the typebars standing in an upright position
when not in use.
The typebars are so arranged that they form
an arc between the platen and the keyboard.
The depression
of the keys forces the typebars down
to the printing point,
and a spring returns and holds them
in
position.
As a re-
sult of this
style of construction there
is constant
stress or

34
tension on the springs controlling the typebars, which must
be overcome when the keys are depressed.
Thus gravita-
tion plays no part in the return of the typebars.
The type-
bars
are
of two
lengths, made necessary
to accommodate
them to the space in the arc.
The Bar-Lock derives
its name from a
series of
pins,
extending up from a steel plate just in front of the printing
point, between which the typebars
strike.
These
pins
are
supposed
to
lock
the
bars
and
preserve
the
alignment.
There are fourteen pins with thirteen spaces, therefore they
cannot
be termed
guides
as
the
type-guide
is
understood
today.
There
is no arrangement by which these pins can
be adjusted, nor would
it be possible, because six typebars
are
supposed
to
be
"locked"
by
each
of
these
thirteen
spaces.
This makes
it necessary to bend the bars, without
order or system, to fit the spaces between the pins.
The manufacturers of the Bar-Lock claim for
it visible
writing,
whicli
it
does
not
have,
for
the
reason
that
the
typebars extend up between the vision of the typist and the
printing point.
In order to see the writing line it is necessary
for the typist to lean forward from the regular position of the
typist while writing, which is little,
if any, improvement over
lifting a carriage.
The
claims
of
the manufacturers
for
visible
writing
served
the purpose
at
least
of
suggesting
the advantages
that might accrue from a machine actually possessing
visi-
bility.
The
insertion
of the paper
is not convenient,
as
it
is
necessary to reach around back of the perpendicular row of
keys.
This also makes corrections difficult, especially where
erasures are necessary.
The manufacturers
also
built
the
Bar-Lock with
the
universal standard keyboard, employing the
shift key.
Al-
though this machine was invented and manufactured in the
United States,
it did not meet the requirements of the ex-

acting American business man, and as a result
is no longer
offered for sale in the country in which
it originated.
DENSMORE
James Densmore, whose
connection
with
the
Sholes,
Glidden and Soule experiments has already been mentioned,
later invented a machine to which he gave his name—Dens-
more.
This machine embodied some new features.
It had
the
first
line-lock.
The purpose of this was to prevent the
piling of characters at the end of the
line.
It was the
first
to employ
ball-bearings
in
the
typebar, and
it
also
intro-
duced the back-spacer in a practical manner.
The Densmore had a keyboard similar to the Reming-
ton with a shift key on each
side.
In an
effort to make
it
more convenient to "get at the work," the inventor devised
a plan by which the platen might be tilted forward in addi-
tion to raising the carriage.
The original Densmore did not have ball-bearing type-
bars.
These were introduced
in the
later model.
The
in-
ventors appreciated the
fact that the shock
in
starting the
balls, which necessarily followed a stroke of the finger keys,
would cause unusual wear not only on the balls but on the
retaining cup.
Hence, an
accelerating arm
or
sleeve was

36
provided
to
start
the
typebars,
thus
relieving
the
balls
of
the shock by
first
receiving the blow and
lifting the
type-
bars on
the ball-bearings
to the printing
point.
This was
not a success, as the friction on the accelerating arm offset
any possible advantage that might have been gained by the
ball-bearings, although
it did relieve the strain or shock on
the balls, resulting from the quick, sharp stroke of the keys.
DENSMORE
The machine at one time was used quite extensively in
the United States.
It embodied the same general principles
as the Remington, which may have accounted for
its popu-
larity
in the typewriter world.
Its manufacture, however,
was
discontinued,
the cause
for which
will
be commented
upon
later.
YOST
G. W. N.
Yost, who figured
in
the production
of
the
first
practical typewriter and also produced
the Caligraph,
later brought out a machine to which he gave his name

37
Yost.
This was the
first machine of any importance to use
an
inking pad
instead
of
a
ribbon.
It was
also
the
first
practical machine to use a type-guide at the printing point.
(This
principle was
first employed by Dr.
Francis.)
The
guide consisted of a solid block of metal with a square hole
in which the type block
fitted
securely.
The work
of
the
Yost was always considered neat and attractive, largely the
result of the guide, but the guide was not adjustable.
The
typebars were made in several sections, and had the machine
not been provided with a guide
it
is doubtful whether
the
work would have been presentable.
Although the Yost was invented by an American and
built
at
Bridgeport,
Conn.,
it
could
not
hold
its
position
against the more active and effective competition in
its own
country and was forced, like the Bar-Lock, to find a foreign
market.
This machine
will be referred
to again
in
the course
of the evolution of the typewriter, for the reason that later
inventions compelled
its manufacturers
to change
its
prin-
ciples of construction almost enirely.
( See page 104)
SPEED CONTESTS
Just preceding the year 1888 the typewriter had grown
in popularity to such an extent that competition arose among
the users as well as the manufacturers concerning the speed
qualities of their respective machines.
This competition was
stimulated by the demand of the buyer and user who recog-
nized the value of speed, accuracy, and
legibility.
Accord-
ingly,
a
contest was arranged
to
ascertain
the
respective
speed merits of the various makes of typewriters.
This con-
test was held at Toronto, Canada,
in August,
1888.
Only
the Remington and the Caligraph participated.
One of the
features of this series of contests was writing for
five min-
utes from the memorized sentence "This is a song to
fill thee

38
with
delight."
This
contest was won by Mr.
F. W.
Os-
borne, using the Caligraph.
In reporting this
series
of
contests,
the Phonographic
World, the policy of which was controlled by the Reming-
ton Typewriter Company, made no reference to the contest
won by
the Caligraph
operator.
In
the November
issue,
however,
of
1888,
in
response
to numerous
inquiries,
the
World produced an extensive article of which the following
are extracts:
"By those who have kept informed concerning the re-
sults
of
the
recent 'Speed
Contests' between
the 'Reming-
ton'
and
'Caligraph'
writing
machines
(the
only
two
machines which have dared to enter for a public contest
in
the world),
it will be remembered that at the International
Contest
at Toronto, August
13
(1888)
last,
three leading
medals were awarded by the Committee in charge, the
first
two being given
to the
'Remington,' and
the
third
to
the
'Caligraph.'
The
first,
a
Gold
Medal,
representing
the
championship of the world for the greatest speed in writing
unfamiliar testimony and business correspondence, was won
by Miss M. E. Orr,
of New York, a Remington operator;
the second,
a
Silver Medal,
in the same
class, was won by
Mr. F. E. McGurrin, of Salt Lake City, Utah, also a Rem-
ington
operator;
and
the
third,
a
Special
Medal,
being
awarded
to Mr.
F. W. Osborne,
of Rochester, N.
Y.,
for
writing the memorized sentence, "This
is a song to
fill thee
with
delight,"
the
greatest number
of
times,
the operator
using the Caligraph."
.
.
.
"We
show
exact
fac-similes
of
the
work
of
both
machines.
These
pages have
been
photographed
directly
from the original copy and are signed by the operators
of
each
instrument.
Both
pages show
excellent
work,
con-
sidering the rapidity with which the keys were struck, and
although
the
Caligraph
operator
is
credited with
writing
sixty-seven
more
words
than
the
Remington
operator,

39
.
.
the sentence was written correctly by the Caligraph
operator only twice, while the Remington operator,
in
less
times, wrote
it correctly forty-nine times."
.
.
.
"To have given in the World's report a full statement
of the writing of the memorized sentence would have been
to more widely advertise the Remington machine than was
called for
at the time
in a news
article, or than we cared
to
do.
.
.
.
But,
as
before
stated, we have
received
numerous inquiries as
to why the World had not reported
this matter, and we here present
it,
in absolute
fac-simile,
and with straightforward facts, leaving the intelligent read-
er to be judge of the respective merits of the two perform-
ances."
There
is much truth worthy of consideration contained
in
these
extracts
taken
from
the
Phonographic
World,
which
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
contests
of
today,
especially with
relation
to
the
quality
of
the work.
The
World
leaves
"the
intelligent
reader
to
be
judge
of
the
respective
merits
of
the two performances," and
for
that
reason a part of the fac-simile copies are submitted on the fol-
lowing two pages.
Typewriting
contests were
revived many years
later,
after the typewriter had been greatly refined and improved.
On page 42
is
a
fac-simile,
photographic
reproduction
of
a part of the work of Miss Rose L. Fritz, writing in open con-
test at the rate of
1 18 words a minute for fifteen minutes with-
out error of any kind.
"The intelligent reader" or buyer will
"judge of the respective merits
of the two performances."
In
some
of
the
recent
contests
writers
using
other
machines than the Underwood have made excellent records,
and the work was considered technically correct, according
to the
rules, but the
"intelligent reader" would not accept
the work
as
practical;
at
least,
he would
not
attach
his
signature to
it; nor
will
those
in
control permit
copies
to
be reproduced in this book.

SMITH PREMIER
The Smith Premier typewriter
is the invention of Alex-
ander T. Brown,
of Syracuse, N.
Y., and
it got
its name
from
L.
C.
Smith,
famous
as
a
manufacturer
of
guns.
This machine appeared on the market in about the year 1890.
It has a duplicate keyboard,
or, as
its manufacturers term
it, a "complete" keyboard, having a key for each character.
The
Smith
Premier
embodied many
features
that
were
superior
to
either
the
Caligraph
or
Bar-Lock,
the
two
machines preceding
it having a character
for each key.
The
rocker
shaft
principle employed
in
this machine
was new
in typewriter construction.
Each finger key stem
was attached
to a spur on the
shaft, and another spur on
the shaft was attached to the connecting
link, which oper-
ated the typebar.
The typebars were suspended in a circle,
and the impression or line of writing was beneath the cylin-
der out of sight, as was the custom of that day.
The bear-
ings of the typebar of the Smith Premier were very long,
which gave
better
control
of
the
alignment
than
on any
of the previous machines.
The Smith Premier had but one
scale and
it was not
necessary to
lift the entire carriage
to see the work.
The
platen was
tilted forward by a
lever
in
a convenient man-
ner,
and
the
writing
line
appeared
just
above
the
scale.
Erasures and corrections were quickly and accurately made.
The machine also employed the
first practical means of re-
versing the ribbon automatically.
Another
feature
of
this machine was
the easy means
by which
the type were
cleaned.
A
circular brush which
rested
just below
the
typebars was
built
in
the
machine.
When
it was desired
to
clean
the type the
platen was
re-
moved, a crank handle inserted and turned until the brush
was brought up into contact with the face of the type, when
a few additional turns
effectually cleaned them.
This was

44
SMITH PREMIER (Blind)
quite an advantage
at that time, because
in order to clean
the
type
on
the
Remington
and
other
machines,
it
was
necessary
to
raise
the
carriage,
lift
each
individual
type-
bar, and brush
the
type one
at
a
time.
This always
re-
sulted
in
soiling
the hands and
for
this
reason
the
typist
neglected cleaning the type
until
the untidy appearance
of
the work made
it
absolutely
necessary.
The
Smith
Pre-
mier proved
a
strong competitor
for
the Remington, both
on account
of
its merit and
the methods
of
the manufac-
turer
in
selling
the
machine,
without
regard
to
uniform
price.
On
account
of
unusual
activity and
price
cutting
the Smith Premier soon secured a large following.
UNION TYPEWRITER COMPANY
The quality of the Smith Premier and other machines,
together
with
the
price
cutting methods
of
the manufac-
turers,
resulted
in forcing the Remington, out
of
self-pro-
tection, into a combination known as the Union Typewriter
Company,
composed
of
the
Remington.
Caligraph
(New
Century), Smith Premier, Yost, Densmore, and other com-
panies.
This combination was formed in 1893 f°r the Pur_
pose of eliminating competition and maintaining the
price.

45
These companies continued
separate organizations but
re-
ceived instructions from, and reported
to, the Union Type-
writer Company, which controlled the entire situation most
effectually,
both
as
to machine
competition and
employes.
In other words, employes could not follow
their conviction
and go from one company
to another without the permis-
sion of the company they were leaving, which was
difficult
to obtain, especially
if the quality of their services was such
as
to
justify any one
of
the
companies
belonging
to
the
Union Typewriter Company in wanting to retain them.
Sales-
men and other employes were subject to discharge on account
of the slightest error or misdemeanor, and they had no re-
course except
to
quit
the
business,
thereby
sacrificing
the
experience of years.
When a salesman was discharged, his
name was placed on a black
list, and only by special dispen-
sation could he secure employment with any
of the afore-
said companies.
In harmony with a universal law
this combination
re-
sulted in the "survival of the fittest."
The Remington type-
writer
was
a
single
shift
key
machine,
and
the
Smith
Premier
a
duplicate
keyboard
machine.
The
Caligraph,
Densmore
and
Yost
embodied
no
special
features
that
would justify
the expense
of maintaining
separate organ-
izations
to market
them.
As
a
result
they were
placed
under one sales department and finally withdrawn from the
American market.
The manufacture of the Caligraph and
Densmore was discontinued entirely, but the Yost embodied
certain
characteristic
features which
appealed
to
the
for-
eign trade, where
it now
finds
its only market.
This combination exists today, but the evolution of the
typewriter and
the
Federal
laws have
compelled them
to
change
their
policy, and the Remington Typewriter Com-
pany has now assumed direct and complete control.
They
now make the Remington, Remington Smith Premier and
the Remington Monarch, a
later product, information con-
cerning which will be presented under the
title "Monarch."

WILLIAMS
The construction of the Williams typewriter
is peculiar.
The platen and the paper carrier traveled through the center
of
the machine, between two
sections
of
typebars.
It was
necessary,
therefore,
for
one
section
of
the
type
to
strike
forward and
the other backward, which made
a
ditYerence
in
the leverage and key
tension.
The Williams employed
two pads
for inking purposes, one
for each
section of type-
bars.
The
type
lay on
the
pads
face downward when
at
rest, and as a result
it was very difficult
to clean them.
The
pads were quite moist and always exposed to dust.
When a finger key
in the front section of typebars was
struck,
the
typebar
was
lifted
up.
moved

and
dozen.—three distinct
directions.
The type
in the back
sec-
tion

of
course,

in
a
similar
manner.
up,
forward and down.
The Williams was
a
double
shift key
machine:
that
is.
it employed one
shift key
for the
capitals
and
the other
for
the
figures and
special characters.
The
typebar
construction was very
complicated.
...-.,— •'..»••
WILLIAMS TYPEBAR
CONSTRUCTION AND ACTION.
The manufacturers of the Williams claimed for
it visi-
ble writing, and the machine did
actually enable
the
typist
to
see one
complete
line
of
writing",
but
this
immediately
passed out
of view under a
scale
into
a
receptacle
for
the
paper
between
the
typebar
sections.
The
manufacturers

47
brought out several models of the Williams, but the great-
est success of the machine consisted
in stimulating the de-
sire on
the
part
of
the
typist
for
an
actual
visible
type-
writer.
The Williams was not
fast;
it was not a good mani-
folder;
it was not convenient to insert paper; the type were
not easily cleaned; and
its only redeeming feature was the
one line of visible writing.
NEW CENTURY
The New Century appeared on the market in 1898.
It
was generally considered an improved Caligraph, and
for
this reason
it received some considerable attention.
It had
a number of improvements over the Caligraph, but retained
the double keyboard principle.
It came at a time, however,
when
the
public were
clamoring
for
visible
writing,
and
because
of
this
fact,
together
with
the
fact
that
it was
a
double keyboard machine,
it was unable to make any head-
way, and
its manufacture was soon discontinued.
BLICKENSDERFER
The Blickensderfer typewriter made
its appearance
in
the early nineties, and
is
still on the market, therefore
it
is
entitled
to
consideration
in
these
steps.
This
machine,
commonly known as the
"Blick,"
is a type-wheel machine;
that
is,
the
type
are
all arranged on
a
wheel, and every
type moves when each key
is
struck.
The type do not act
independently as on most machines, hence
it became neces-
sary to arrange a
special keyboard
in order
to produce the
best results from
this
style of construction, and because of
this
special keyboard the machine did not meet with favor
among touch
typists.
The supply of ink
is obtained from
a
roller pad.
The "Blick"
is
small, hence
easily portable;
it
is
also
a cheap machine, and the
style of type may be changed by

48
changing
the
wheel.
Because
of
its
portability,
its
sim-
plicity, the ease of changing type, and
its price,
it has won
a place, or at least a niche, in the commercial world.
How-
ever,
it
is not found in the large and more important offices
where quantity and quality of work are the prime consid-
erations, but among those who have
little work, do
it them-
selves, and want
it done on a typewriter.
BUCKKNSDERPKR
(LATE MODEL)
Mr.
Blickensderfer died August,
191 7,
since the
fore-
going was written.
BUCK ELECTRIC
The maufacturers of the "Blick" produced an electric
machine,
which
promised
to
revolutionize
the
typewriter
business, but the promise was not
fulfilled.
It had
its ad-
vantages,
but
the
disadvantages
evidently
were
greater,
because of the complications of the
electric motor require-
ments.
The carriage reverse and
all other active parts of
the machine were controlled by electricity, but the best evi-
dence of
its imperfection
is that
its manufacture was soon

49
discontinued.
The
electric typewriter would eliminate
to a
great extent the human element, and for that reason
it is not
likely to become popular.
MANHATTAN
The Manhattan
typewriter was composed
of
features
that were formerly embodied
in the No. 2 Remington.
It
had no original principles and there was no excuse for
its
having been constructed.
It resembled very much
in form
and feature the No.
2 model Remington, which the Rem-
ington Company had already discarded, and as a
result of
going backward
instead
of forward,
it had
a very
short,
unprofitable experience in the business world.
FRANKLIN
The Franklin typewriter
is not entitled to space in con-
sidering
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter,
because
it
ad-
vanced no new ideas,
it possessed no new features, and as
a result
it was short-lived.
The typebars stood up in front,
between the keyboard and the platen, and struck down after
the fashion
of the Bar-Lock.
The keyboard was
circular
and non-standard.
The only reason
it
is given space here
is that
it did receive some consideration from the business
world which contributed somewhat to the education
of the
public
to
the
appreciation
of the commercial value
of
the
typewriter.
The public having begun to recognize the value of the
typewriter, and
the
sales system
of
the manufacturers
of
the
better
writing machines
not
having been
thoroughly
organized,
a
number
of
cheaper,
inefficient
typewriters
found a market.
This
will account
for
the mention
of a
number of typewriters that really possessed no features that
contributed
to
the
evolution
of
the typewriter.
However,

50
the business man soon began to appreciate the fact that the
best was really the cheapest.
REMINGTON-SHOLES
This machine got
its name from a Mr. Remington and
a Mr.
Sholes, who were
the
patentees.
These gentlemen
were direct descendants of the Remington and Sholes fami-
lies
of typewriter fame.
They advanced the
foolish argu-
ment that
"if horses and dogs are bought by pedigree the
same plan might well be adopted in selecting a typewriter."
The name Remington-Sholes attracted more attention than
any other feature of the machine, but
it was finally changed
to Rem-Sho, for legal reasons.
REM-SHO
FIRST BASKET-SHIFT MACHINE.
The Remington Typewriter Company
sought and
se-
cured an injunction restraining the use of the name "Rem"
as
an
abbreviation
of
Remington,
hence
the
name
was
changed
to
Fay-Sho.
The
case
was
appealed,
and
the
court's decision which gave the injunction was reversed.
In
the meantime,
however,
the machine had
lost
favor,
if
it
ever possessed any, with
the
public, and
it was compelled
to seek a foreign market, as did several other machines that

51
were
unable
to make good
in
the United
States.
Later,
this machine was reconstructed
almost
entirely and given
the name Japy, as the "pedigree" proposition had
failed
to
contribute to
its success as had been anticipated.
The "Rem-Sho,-Fay-Sho,-Japy" had a keyboard similar
to
the
Remington,
but
instead
of
shifting
the
platen
the
whole type basket was shifted.
This machine, of numerous
aliases, therefore,
is entitled to the
distinction of being the
first to
shift the type basket for
capitals.
Another feature
that met with some favor was the interchangeable carriage.
It was possible to use carriages of different lengths on this
machine.
It was
also
the
first blind machine
to have
the
marginal stops
in front.
YETMAN
The Yetman
typewriter was
invented by
Charles
E.
Yetman, who labored for many years trying to bring
it to
a degree
of
perfection
that would
justify
its being placed
upon
the market.
This
he
succeeded
in
doing about
the
year
1903.
This machine was intended to serve a double purpose.
That
is,
it might be used as a regular commercial machine,
but
its
principal purpose was
for
the transmission
of
tele-
graphic messages.
By pressing a lever on the
left of
this
machine
it would open a telegraphic circuit and connect the
keys in such a way that telegraphic messages could be sent.
A corresponding lever on the right side connected the key-
board with the typebars and a message could be sent and a
copy made in type at the same time.
It was also possible,
by releasing the lever on the
left, to convert
it into a type-
writer
for
ordinary commercial
use,
without any
connec-
tion with the telegraphic circuit.
It will be seen, therefore,
that
the
machine
could
be
used
for
either
or
both
pur-
poses.

52
The work of this machine was effectual, and
it seems
strange that the principle has not survived and developed;
but
it was evidently impractical from the fact that
it has not
been
revived
since
the company, organized
to promote
it,
met with reverses which caused
its failure.
The career of
this machine was short, but
it promoted the idea of visible
typewriting among telegraph
operators,
for whom
it was
primarily
intended.
Although
few
machines
were made
and
used,
the
telegraph
operators
learned
through
the
Telegraphic Age to appreciate the value of
visible writing
for receiving and transmitting messages.
FOX
The Fox
typewriter
is
a
machine
that
possesses no
special
merit.
Its
principal
asset,
in
the
original
blind
machine,
consisted
in
the typebar
hangers.
Its manufac-
turers claimed that wear and consequent
lost motion in the
typebar bearings, which would affect the alignment,
could
be readily adjusted.
It was originally built after the
style
of the Remington, that
is, employing the understroke blind
writing principle.
All manufacturers up
to
this time found
difficulty
in
building
their
regular machine
in
such
a manner
that
it
would respond to the speed of the typist, and most of them
provided special escapements, or reverse-action dogs, which
an ordinary operator
could not
use.
The Fox typewriter
made an escapement which could be adjusted
to meet the
requirements of the typist more nearly than any of the pre-
ceding machines.
It was possible to cause the escapement
to be made either on the upward or downward movement
of the typebar.
The Fox contained no other improvements that might
be
considered
in
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter over
the
machines that had preceded
it and did not possess
sufficient
merit
in
its
blind
style
of
construction,
or
in
any
other

53
style for that matter,
to encourage a very extensive trade,
as compared with some other machines.
PEERLESS
The Peerless typewriter
is perhaps entitled to mention,
not because
of
the value of
the machine, but because
the
Smith Brothers, who became famous through the manufac-
ture of the Smith Premier typewriter and later the machine
to
which
they
gave
their
name,
were
interested
in
the
machine.
The Peerless typewriter was a double keyboard
machine.
It
contained
no
advantages
over
previous
machines and
is given
space here only
for
the
reason
as
stated above.
DUPLEX
The Duplex typewriter was an invention that did not
serve the purpose for which
it was intended, that
is,
to
in-
crease
the speed
of
the
typist.
It was
a double keyboard
machine divided into four sections.
The capitals were on the
upper
left
side.
There were two sets of small
letters occu-
pying the lower half of the keyboard, while the upper right
half of the keyboard was taken up with numerals and punc-
tuation
marks.
It
provided
a means by which two
keys
might be struck at the same time, thereby making two im-
pressions at once.
That
is, the typebars on the left struck
one space ahead of those on the right, and by striking any
two keys on opposite sides at the same time,
it would give
two impressions
in
the proper
space,
the
left coming
first.
This method of operating was found
to
retard,' rather
than advance, the speed of the
typist, and
as
a
result the
purpose of the machine was not
realized and
its manufac-
ture was discontinued.
ELLIOTT-FISHER
The original idea of the early inventors of typewriters,

54
it seems, was
to write
in bound books, but no practical
re-
sults
in
this
direction had
been
attained
until
the
Elliott
Book Typewriter was
placed upon
the market.
This ma-
chine was later supplemented by improvements brought out
by
a
Mr.
Hatch
and
the machine became known
as
the
Elliott and Hatch
typewriter.
This machine
reversed the
general
style
of
typewriter
construction by having
a
sta-
tionary,
flat
writing
plate and
a
movable head
and
key-
board.
It would indeed write on books
quite
successfully,
but
it
required
a
great
deal
of
shifting and
adjusting
to
hold
the bound page
securely
in
position
in
order
to pro-
duce
satisfactory
results.
The machine
traveled from
left
to
right
across and down
the
page.
The
entire machine
swung on
a back way-rod, and was supported
in
front by
two wheels running on a
flat steel track.
This way-rod and
front track or frame were
parallel, and supported the ma-
chine
in
its movement from
left
to
right.
The side frame
or
plates, which supported the machine
in
its course down
the page, were cogged
to correspond with two cog-wheels
which measured the line spacing.
This machine was not fast, because of the. fact that the
entire machine
traveled
over
the
printed
page,
instead
of
carrying the page
as
did
all
other machines preceding
it.
This changed the position of the keyboard from the
left to
right every time
a key was
struck.
It
also necessitated a
change of the
entire machine downward every time a
line
was
written.
In other words,
the
entire machine traveled
on a frame over the writing plate from the upper
left hand
corner of a book or printed page, down
to the lower right
hand corner.
If the book was large the arms had to be ex-
tended to write the
first line, while on the lower
line
it was
necessary to draw the arms down following the movement
of the machine.
In
fact, the finger keys never occupied the
same
position
twice
in
writing
a
page.
It
will
be
seen
from
this
that
speed,
together with
accuracy, was
impos-
sible.

55
The work was beneath the machine and the whole type-
bar and
finger key
lever
system,
ribbon, and
all working
parts
of the machine had
to be moved
in order
to
see
the
work.
During its introductory period a machine was invented
by Robert
J.
Fisher, embodying
the same
general
princi-
ples so far as the operation of the machine laterally and up
and down
was
concerned.
Two draw
bands,
or
main-
springs,
were
necessary
to
pull
the
machine,
The
type-
bars stood above the printing point and struck downward,
something
after
the
fashion
of
the
Bar-Lock.
The
key-
board was on top of the machine above the typebars, which
made
type-cleaning extremely
difficult.
This machine
re-
quired three universal bars for the keys; one for the lower
bank, another
for the second and third banks, and a third
for the upper bank.
By
pressing
a
lever which threw
the
ribbon
back,
it
was
possible
for
the
operator
to
look down
through
the
machine and
see
the work
to
ascertain whether
or
not
a
mistake had been made.
If
it was found that a correction
was necessary, the whole working parts of the machine had
to be moved.
On
the
Elliott and Hatch machine,
if
the
operator was
in doubt,
it was necessary to move the entire
machine
to remove the doubt.
A
combination
was
formed
between
Fisher
and
the
Elliott &
Hatch
Company,
which
became known
as
the
Elliot-Fisher Company.
This was due
principally
to
the
fact
that
the
Fisher machine made
it more convenient
to
see the writing.
In other words,
the necessity
for
visible
writing was
recognized
in
order
to
satisfy
a
desire
with
which the minds
of
the
typist and the business public had
become imbued.
The
Elliott-Fisher
writes on
a
flat surface and
there
are many claims made
for the machine on account of
this
fact, but the
loose-leaf system of binding books soon mini-

56
mized
the
advantage
of
the
Elliott-Fisher
machine
for
writing
in books and
as
a
result
the company has turned
its
attention
almost
entirely
to
billing
and
form
work.
For some
time
their
business was
quite
extensive
in
this
line, and
it
is
still their principal asset, but progress means
development, and
the
typewriter
industry provides no
ex-
ception.
The
Elliott-Fisher
is
still
active,
but
not
to any
great
extent
as
a
correspondence
or book
typewriter,
the
purpose
for which
it was originally designed.
The follow-
ing
is
a
cut
of
the
latest model
Elliott-Fisher.
ELUOTT-FISHER
The machine of today embodies the same general prin-
ciple.
The improvement
consists principally
in making the
work more
visible.
OLIVER
The Oliver typewriter
is indeed an ingenious machine.
It
is the product of the mind of Thomas Oliver, a minister.
It
is
said
that Mr.
Oliver,
at
a
conference
of
ministers,

57
learned
of
the
value of
the
typewriter
for
preparing and
preserving records
of semons, and although he had never
seen
a
typewriter,
he determined
to
construct
one.
The
truth of
this statement
is confirmed by the general appear-
ance of the machine,
as there has never been
a typewriter
of similar construction either before or
since.
The
typebars
stand
erect
in two
banks,
one on
each
side of the printing point.
There are fourteen typebars
in
each bank which stand a
little back of perpendicular when
in a
position of
rest.
These typebars vary
in length; that
is, beginning with
the
inside
bar,
each
succeeding bar
in
the bank
is
just a
little longer,
stands a
little higher, and
sets
a
little farther back than the one preceding
it.
Both
banks are
alike,
that
is,
the typebars
in each bank are
of
corresponding
length.
The
outside
bars,
or
those
at
the
extreme
right and
left,
are about
three times
as
long
as
the inside bars.
To make
these bars
strike
a common center with
the
same
degree
of
speed
and
force
was
indeed
a
difficult
mechanical
problem.
The
typeblocks
on
the
inside
bars
are just a little heavier than on each succeeding bar, to make
up the necessary force that a body having a greater drop
acquires from gravitation.
It was also necessary to change
the leverage of each succeeding bar, in order that the speed
might be
increased
accordingly.
As
these typebars
stand
in an upright position when not
in
operation,
they require
tension springs
to return them
to this
position.
Although
the forward movement of the typebar can be regulated by
leverage
to
equalize
the
speed
of
the
typebars,
and
the
weight
of
the
typeblock
regulated
to
equalize
the impres-
sion, this leverage and weight must be overcome
in the re-
turn of the typebars.
The connecting links that control the
typebars
are
attached
to "shock absorbers"
on
the
finger
key
lever.
This
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
disagreeable
touch in starting the typebars, which incline a
little back of
perpendicular when in a position of
rest.

58
Each typebar
carries three
characters.
This makes a
double shift necessary.
When the carriage
is in
its normal
or
central
position,
the
machine
writes
small
characters
without
shifting.
To write
capitals
the
carriage must be
shifted backward, while the figures and punctuation marks
require a forward shift.
It
is absolutely necessary that the
desk
on
which
this machine
sets
be
level,
otherwise
the
shifts work very irregularly.
In fact,
if the desk be sloped
equal to that of a cashier's desk, the backward shift will not
work at all.
The shift keys at best are very heavy because
they are not aided by gravitation.
Visible writing
is claimed by the Oliver, but the claim
is without the foundation of
fact,
at
least
in the sense of
complete visibility.
Only the last ten characters of the line
of writing can be seen, and
if
it
is necessary
to read the
complete
line or several
lines
to get
the
context,
the
car-
riage must be released and moved back and forth in order
that the writing
line may appear
in the reading space be-
tween the two banks of typebars.
Therefore,
to read
sev-
eral lines on the Oliver might be aptly compared with read-
ing a newspaper through a knot-hole.
The
Oliver
is
considered
a good manifolder;
it
does
good
stencil work;
it maintains
its alignment
fairly
well;
and
is considered quite durable, but
it lacks speed;
it does
not have a standard keyboard
;
it
is extremely noisy, and
when
it is necessary to make erasures they have to be made
between
the two banks
of
type.
This
necessitates
great
care,
lest the hand become
soiled by contact with the face
of
the
type,
which
are
the
most
exposed
part
of
the
machine.
The adjustments, levers, and releases used in the
operation
of
the Oliver are back and below
the
typebars.
There
is no
carriage
reverse
lever.
The
carriage
is
re-
versed by
the
left hand pushing
in on the
cylinder knob,
and as a
result the
line spacing does not
take
place
until
the carriage approaches the end of
the
line.
In
fact,
the

59
Oliver lacks many refinements and conveniences that other
typewriters have.
The machine, however,
is better than the policy of the
company, which has always been uncertain and vacillating.
There has never been any
fixed
price on
the machine,
al-
though catalogued at one hundred dollars.
Within the
last
few months the price has been advertised openly
at
forty-
nine
dollars, which would be about
the average
price
re-
ceived
for the machine
since
its
introduction.
This
price,
however,
demonstrates
that
the
manufacturers
recognize
that
it
is not worth what other machines
bring, and
this
change has placed
it
in
its proper position—about half the
standard value.
OLIVER
When
the
Oliver was
first
placed on
the market
its
manufacturers and salesmen everywhere claimed for
it visi-
ble writing,
all of which served to stimulate the increasing
desire for a typewriter that would actually produce
visible
writing.

60
VISIBLE WRITERS
The development
of manufacturing
facilities,
the
re-
quirements
of
the
business man and
the demands
of
the
typist,
resulted
in
directing
the
efforts
of
inventors
to-
ward producing a
strictly
visible writing machine,
as has
been
shown.
Many
unsuccessful
efforts
had
been
made,
and some manufacturers
actually
claimed
visible
writing,
but
their
claims were
not
sustained
by
practical
results,
as
some
machines
only
showed
one
line,
others
a
short
space between
the
bars,
while on
others
it was
necessary
for the operator
to lean forward
in order
to see the work.
PROUTY
In response to the requirements of a universal demand
many
efforts were made
to
invent
a machine
that would
produce and continue
visible writing from
the
first
to the
last
word.
In
1888,
E.
Prouty,
of
Chicago,
Illinois,
in-
vented a front stroke machine
to which he gave his name.
Mr.
Prouty more
nearly
accomplished
the
desired
result
PROUTY
FIRST FRONT STROKE MACHINE'.

61
than any former inventor,- but he failed
in that the writing
was hidden to the extent of the width of the ribbon.
This
machine,
therefore,
contained
nothing more
than an
idea,
which,
having
been
sown
in
the
fertile mind
of
genius,
took
root
and
produced
an
abundantly
satisfactory
har-
vest, as future developments show.
The machine embodied
the
first front stroke principle, and the writing was
visible
except
at
the immediate
writing
point,
this being covered
by
the
ribbon which
ran from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the machine
instead
of
horizontally,
as on
all
typewriters
of today.
GRUNDY
On
June
n,
1889,
Mr.
Arthur
Grundy,
of
White-
stone, New
York,
secured
a
patent
for
a
front
stroke
machine on which the ribbon ran horizontally,
falling back
out
of
the
vision
of
the
writer
after
the
impression
had
been made.
In
his patent claim Mr. Grundy
says:
"The
exposing of the
line of printing
is brought about primarily
by mounting the inking ribbon upon a
tilting frame, which
is raised to position at every stroke of the type arms."
This machine was never placed upon
the market and
is
only
given
space
here
because
it
advanced
an
idea
in
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter
from
which
the
business
world
has
received
great
benefit.
-
DAUGHERTY
The
next
machine
and
a
more
highly
developed
product was
the Daugherty.
This machine
also embodied
the front stroke principle and the writing was entirely visi-
ble
all the time, but
it was only a
step
in advance of pre-
vious
efforts of manufacturers
to produce a
strictly
visible
writing machine without impairing
in any way, but rather

a
improving,
the
efficiency
of blind machines.
This machine
was
simple and
contained
very
tew
parts— in
tact
so
few
that
the
requirements
and
refinements
necessary
for
all
kinds and
classes
of
business were
lacking,
but
its advan-
tages
as
well
as
its
disadvantages
served
to
suggest
im-
provement
over
the
Prouty, and
it
is
entitled
to
consider-
ation and
great
credit
in
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter.
An
effort was made
to improve the machine and make
it
tit
the
requirements
of
the
business
world,
but
it
had
gotten
a
wrong-
start, and although
its name was changed
to
the
Pittsburg
Visible,
it
could
not overcome
the handi-
cap
of
a "wrong
start." and
as
a
result
the machine was
not
a
success.
However,
it embodied
ideas
that
served
to
assist
in
the
perfection
of
its immediate
successor.
UNDERWOOD
The Underwood
is the
first practical front stroke, com-
pletely
visible writing machine,
and.
as
will be shown.
tJic
pivotal
machine
which
revolutionised
the
typewriter
in-
dustry by
forcing other manufacturers
to
turn round
to
a
common-sense
basis.
Hence,
the Underwood
is
the
last
step
in
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter
today.
The ma-
chines
mentioned
hereafter,
that
have
been
compelled
to
imitate
the Underwood,
only
serve
to emphasize
this
fact,
and
for
this
purpose
and
for
historical
information
are
considered.
Mr.
Fran-
X.
Wagner,
of New
York
(recently
de-
ceased), had been
associated
with
the development
of
the
earliest
models
of
the
Remington.
Caligraph,
and
other
writing
machines
since
their
inception.
This
gave
him
an extensive experience
in typewriter
construction,
as
well
as
a thorough knowledge
of
public
requirements, and
the
desires
of
the
typist
for
visible
writing;.
He
was
also
familiar
with
the
efforts and
failures
of manufacturers
to
produce
a
satisfactory
visible
writing
machine.

63
Profiting- by
the
mistakes
of
others,
but more
espe-
cially by personal experience, Mr. Wagner invented a type-
bar mechanism and incorporated
it in a machine, for which
he
filed
application
for
patent,
April
27,
1893,
the same
being granted July 31, 1894 (No. 523698).
This machine
later became known as the Underwood.
The result of Mr. Wagner's invention not only solved
the problem
of
visible
writing,
for which
other
inventors
had been striving for years, but the fundamental principles
involved
in
the Underwood brought about
radical changes
in
future
typewriter
construction.
This machine not only
produced
actual
visible
writing, from
the
first
to
the
last
word—for which
typists had been asking every time they
raised the carriage to inspect the work—but it embodied many
other radical, practical improvements.
It
is
truly
said
that
typewriter
inventors
first
devise
the
principle and
construct
the
typebar,
then
build
the
machine around
it.
Mr. Wagner's
chief object was
to
in-
vent a
strictly
visible
writing machine without
sacrificing
any
of
the
advantages
employed
in
former
typewriters.
This he
did, and the
style
of mechanism necessary
to
ac-
complish
his
object developed
so many
excellent,
superior
features
that
the
results
even
exceeded
the
anticipations
of the most ardent advocates
of
visible
writing.
For
ex-
ample:
The
front stroke
principle
of the typebar brought
the type, face up, in front of the typist, practically inviting
the brush, which
resulted
in
clean,
clear impressions.
The
marginal
stops
are
in
front;
the
scale
with
which
the
machine
is
provided
for
setting
marginal
stops,
tabular
stops
(corresponding
with
tabular
scale),
and
the
scale
locating the exact
position
of
printing,
are
also
in
front;
and many
other
conveniences
which
older
machines
did
not
possess.
The Underwood
typewriter, which was manufactured

64
by
the Wagner
Typewriter Company
during
its
experi-
mental
period,
was
invented
and
introduced
at
a
most
opportune
time.
The
efforts
of
other
inventors
and
the
advertising
of
other
manufacturers,
who
had
attempted
to produce visible writing, had thoroughly prepared public
opinion
for
it, and the sterling qualities of the Underwood
not only satisfied their desires, but inspired their immediate
enthusiasm.
UNDERWOOD
Mr.
John
T.
Underwood,
who
had
been
connected
for many
years
with
the
typewriter
supply
business, was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
requirements
of
the
trade.
He
recognized
fully
the
value
of
visible
writing,
as
well
as
the
many
other
excellent
features
employed
in
the
machine, and
as
a
result bought Mr. Wagner's inventions
and
interests.
Mr.
Underwood
associated
with
him
Mr.
D. W. Bergen, present treasurer of the Underwood Type-
writer
Company,
and
later
Mr.
S.
T.
Smith,
General
Manager of the company, which position he retained
until
his death
in May,
191 5.

65
Inasmuch
as
the Underwood
represents
the acme
of
perfection
in present-day, practical typewriter construction,
it
is
not
out
of
place
to
describe
the machine more
in
detail.
The Underwood typewriter
first occupied three rooms
in
the
St.
Paul
building,
220
Broadway.
In
1894-5
a
few hand-made models were produced.
In
1896,
the
esti-
mated
output was
fifty machines;
in
1897,
two
hundred
eighty-six; in 1898, two thousand one hundred sixty-seven.
From
this
time
the growth
of
the Underwood
has
been
phenomenal, both on account of the merit of the machine,
and
the broad
policy
of
the Company.
The Company soon found
it necessary
to
seek larger
quarters,
which
were
secured
in
Bayonne, New
Jersey,
in
1898,
but
the demand
for
the machine became
so
in-
tensely
active
that
it became
necessary
to make
further
provision for better manufacturing facilities in a permanent
home.
This resulted in the purchase of a
site at Hartford,
Conn.,
to which place the factory was moved
in
190 1.
At
that
time
the
employes
of
the
factory
were
only
about
three
hundred—today,
under
normal
conditions, they
ex-
ceed
five thousand.
The Underwood typewriter
is most compact and com-
plete.
It
is
the embodiment
of
strength,
symmetry,
and
simplicity.
There
are
four
fundamental
principles
in
the
con-
struction
of
a
typewriter
to which
all
others
are
supple-
mentary.
First,
the
typebar
construction
and
action,
which
makes
the
impression;
second,
the
escapement
or
movement of
the carriage from
right
to
left, which
gives
new space
for each succeeding character;
third,
the move-
ment
of
the
ribbon
which
provides
coloring
matter
for
the
impression
;
fourth,
the
return
of
the
carriage
from
left
to
ri°:ht.
The Underwood typebar
construction
is
unique,
there

66
being but three parts—the finger key lever, the connecting
link,
and
the
typebar
proper—each
of
which
is
simpler
and
stronger
than
the
corresponding
part
of
any
other
typewriter.
In addition to the simplicity of the typebar con-
struction there
is but one part
to
all o\ the typebar bearings;
one part
to
all of the bearings oi the links: and one part
to
all of the bearings o\ the finger key levers.
UNDERWOOD TYPEBAR BEARING
The
typebar
construction
of
the Underwood
is
such
that
the
impression
and
the
escapement
are
both
made
by the typebar proper
at
the same
time;
that
is, while the
type
impression
is being made,
the
heel
of
the typebar
at
the bearing comes
in
direct contact with the universal bar
which controls the escapement, thus eliminating
all possible
lost motion between
the stroke
of
the key and the escape-
ment.
This
is
not common
in
other
machines.
The position of the type, as referred
to before, enables
the
typist
to
clean
the
type
instantly
and
as
often
as
needed,
without
soiling
the
hands.
The
Underwood
is
also provided with an adjustable type-guide, which insures
absolute control of the typebar
at both ends,
at the bearing
and the printing points.
The
marginal
stops
are
set
instantly
at
any
desired
point
without
guess
or
doubt.
Tt
is
also
possible
to
get
into
the margin
on

Ball-bearings are employed wherever
it

The carriage
rides on

the rotary

is on
ball-bearings, and
the mainspring
rotates
on

all
of
which
make
a

The Underwood typewriter embodied
the
first
in-built
tabulator and
controlled
all
patents
of any
kind
covering
the
tabulating
idea.
The

are
attached
to

UNDERWOOD TABULAR STOPS
The forward movement
of
the
typebar
is
accelerated
by means
of
a cam
in
which
the
actuating
lever
works,
and
while
this
insures
a
quicker
forward movement,
the
reaction
of
the
universal
bar,
with
which
the
typebar
comes in direct contact,
forces the quickest possible return
UNDERWOOD TYPEBAR AND UNIVERSAL BAR
of
the
typebar.
This
is
most
important
as
speed
and
accuracy
in typewriting consists more
in
the return
of the
bar
than
in
the
forward
movement.
This
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
forward movement
is
governed by
the

69
skill
of
the
typist,
while
the
return
movement
depends
entirely upon the mechanism of the machine.
Not
the
least among
the many
original
features
of
the Underwood typewriter
is the placing of the right hand
shift key down
in the lower bank on a
level with the
left
UNDERWOOD ESCAPEMENT
hand
shift key.
This has made
possible
a balanced hand
action,
so necessary
in
touch
typewriting.
The
accurate,
even escapement of the Underwood typewriter
is the result
UNDERWOOD INDIVIDUAL KEY TENSION
of the rigid dog being beveled, which
permits the carriage

70
to
start
forward
instantly
the
typebar
leaves
the
printing
point.
The
individual key
tension
of
the Underwood,
an-
other ordinal feature, makes
it possible to adjust each finger
key
to the desire and requirements of the touch typist. This
feature has
not
as
yet
been
successfully
imitated.
One
of
the
splendid though seemingly minor
features
of the Underwood
is the cushion upon which the type
rest.
This
is patented, and consists of
a bag of
shot
to prevent
a rebound when the typebars return
to the position of
rest.
In addition
to the cushion preventing reaction
of the type-
bars,
the
shot,
being
round,
the
return
of
the
typebars
keeps
the
shot
in
their
proper
position
in
the
bag.
This
contributes
greatly
to
the
speed and
accuracy
of
the ma-
chine,
by
preventing
the
type
from
clashing
on
the
re-
bound.
Much more might
be
said with reference
to the many
superior
features
oi
the
Underwood
typewriter,
but
it
could
not
be
expressed more
intelligently and
impartially
than by quoting
the
certified
report
of
the Franklin
Insti-
tute
accompanying
the
Elliott
Cresson
Medal,
which
it
issued
to
the Underwood
Typewriting Company
in
1910
for
"Ingenuity,
Skill,
and
Perfection
of Workmanship."
The
Franklin
Institute
of
Pennsylvania
was
estab-
lished nearly
a hundred years
ago.
Its
object
is
the pro-
motion
of
the Mechanic
Arts, by educating mechanics and
encouraging
manufacturers
"by
offering premiums
on
all
objects deemed worthy
of
encouragement,
and examining
all new
inventions
submitted
to
them.''
The membership
of
this
Institution
consists
of
the most
expert and
influen-
tial
body
of
mechanical
engineers
in
the
world,
and
its
awards
are
recognized
as
the
highest and most important
that
are
issued.
The
Franklin
Institute
issues
a number
of
medals,
of
which
the
Elliott
Cresson
is
the
highest.
The
value
of
its
awards
will
be
appreciated
more
fully
from
the
fact
that
its
recognition
can
be
gained
only
through
the medium
of
merit.

71
The awarding
of
the
Elliott
Cresson
Medal
is
safe-
guarded by the publication of the Committee's report, setting
forth the Institute's intentions "in three successive issues of
the Journal of the Franklin Institute."
The Underwood Standard Typewriter was
before
the
Institute
for
investigation
for
more
than
a
year
before
the final granting of the award.
The report accompanying
the medal
follows:
"HALL OF THE INSTITUTE
Philadelphia, February
2,
1910.
No. 2473.
The
Franklin
Institute
of
the
State
of
Pennsylvania,
acting
through
its
Committee
on
Science
and
the
Arts,
investigating
the
Underwood Typewriter of
the Underwood Typewriter Company,
re-
ports as follows:
In the thirty-five years
that have passed since the Franklin
In-
stitute was called upon to pass judgment upon the merits of the
first
practical
typewriting machine
that was
then
being
offered
for
gen-
eral use, as embodied
in the Sholes and Glidden
invention,
(later the
foundation
of
the
well-known
Remington
Typewriter)
the
writing
machine has become indispensable to our business
life.
It
is but nat-
ural that so important and useful a piece of mechanism should have
undergone
in
these years many changes
in
construction
in
response
to the demand
for greater
efficiency and wider range of work as
its
use became more
general.
To
these improvements an army
of
in-
genious mechanicians have given time and talent, out of which efforts
the
marvelously complete
typewriter
of today
has
developed.
During
the
first
fifteen
years
of
writing machine
history
the
understroke machine
attained
such prominence
that few
looked
for
any radical change in the then accepted form, which had reached enor-
mous demand, and was considered to be well-nigh ultimate perfection.
There were some minds however
that reasoned
that the capacity of
the typewriter could be
greatly increased by some new arrangement
of typebar
action
that would cause
the
printing
to be made
in
full
view
of
the
operator,
and
thus
avoid
the
necessity
of
lifting
the
platen
in order to see the writing accomplished.
Evidence
of
this
conviction began
to appear
in
practical form
with
the
invention
of
the
front
stroke
visible
typewriter
as shown

72
in
the patented
efforts
of
Messrs.
Prouty and
Hynes,
No.
389854,
September
18,
1888.
Like
many
others
this
first
attempt
lacked
in details and completeness many essentials to qualify
it as a rival of
the well accepted machines of the older form.
Other inventors how-
ever soon began
to supply the
deficiencies, and
in
a very
short time
the essentials of a complete and practical visible typewriter had been
devised, and the threatened invasion of
the
field began
to look more
formidable.
Contributions
of
value
in
this new
departure
developed
rap-
idly
in the years following
1890, and
it
is
in part from these inven-
tions
that
the
present Underwood
Typewriter
obtained
its
footing,
which paved the way
to the high state of perfection of that machine
as
it exists today.
The inventions patented and controlled by the Underwood Type-
writer Company now number more than
fifty, printed copies of
thir-
teen of
the more important ones
issued between the years 1890 and
1906 are on
file with the papers pertaining
to
this
case, and may be
consulted for more detailed description of the devices therein covered.
(Patent numbers and dates only omitted.)
Among the more promi-
nent features of the Underwood Typewriter which merits special men-
tion we desire to refer to the Gathright Tabulating device, patented in
1890.
This
is an ingeniously contrived element to equip the machine
with
facilities
for
tabular work and
bill
writing,
adding
notably
to
the
field of usefulness of the writing machine.
This
invention,
largely
copied,
has
been
held
by
the
United
States
Circuit Court
of
Appeals,
in
an
action
for
infringement,
to
be
a
basic
patent.
The
Court
in
sustaining
this
patent
says
:
'In
short we are constrained to say that to Gathright belongs the credit of
constructing the
first commercially successful tabulator,
his invention
belongs to that large class, which has ever been treated with liberality
by the courts when the inventor by an apparently simple change, addi-
tion or
transposition
of
parts, has converted
imperfection
into com-
pleteness.'
The tabulator consists of a system of adjustable stops mounted
upon a special rack-bar running parallel with, and back of the platen.
When these movable stops are set at desired intervals along the rack-
bar they act as positive stops to bring the platen into position to print
columns
of
figures.
A
tabulator
key
releases
the
platen
from
the
restraint of the usual escapement rack and allows
it
to make a quick
pass
to
the
tabulator
stops,
one
after
the
other
as
desired.
Con-

73
nected
with
the
release
key
is
a
friction
device
that
places
the
speed of travel of the platen over the long interval between the tabu-
lator stops within the control of the operator, by using more or
less
pressure upon the key as the platen moves
; these tabulator
stops do
not
in any way interfere with
the regular type-width escapement of
the platen when no tabulating
is to be done.
The whole tabulating device
is an added
facility that materially
increases the scope of the typewriter
for column work and
is an im-
portant time saver to effect positive wide interval stops of the platen.
A very important device
is the escapement, which
controls
the
intermittent
lateral movements of
the
platen, with a degree of speed
and precision
that
is remarkable.
Perfection
in
this part of
a
type-
writer implies a device that
will actuate the platen immediately after
each type impression
is made, without perceptible
effort on
the part
of the operator, and with a rapidity of action far beyond the require-
ments
of
the most
expert
operator,
at
the same
time
the wearing
quality of the parts that affect the release and catch movements must
be such as will withstand the severe shocks given one hundred thou-
sand times daily for several years with undiminishing reliability.
The committee has taken pains to thoroughly test the Underwood
Escapement with regard to
its ultimate speed, and
for wearing quali-
ties as developed in typewriters having had eight years of hard usage.
Expert, prize winning operators have demonstrated their ability
to
write
for an hour
at
the
remarkably high
speed
of
ten
strokes
per
second, and have
written
for
the
committee,
from
one
to two
minutes,
at the enormous
rate of
fourteen
strokes per second,
with-
out errors.
An electrically driven automatic typewriting machine which oper-
ates
in the manner of the
familiar mechanical piano
player has
also
demonstrated
its ability to produce beautiful work on the Underwood
Typewriter at a speed of fourteen strokes, or impressions, per second,
continuously.
Having thus obtained
reliable
results of
the
efficiency
of the Underwood escapement up to fourteen strokes per second, your
committee
felt an interest in an effort to determine the ultimate speed
efficiency of the escapement.
To reach this result a mechanical writer
was made
that would enable
tests of
speed
to be made
indefinitely,
and with the aid of
this machine the typewriter was operated
at
in-
creasing
velocities
up
to
twenty
strokes
per
second.
The
result
showed that, up to eighteen strokes per second, the Underwood Type-
writer responded perfectly, under normal conditions of spring tension

74
to
platen, which
rate
is
already
far heyond
the
reach
of
the human
hand.
As
to
the durability
of
the escapement parts we
find
in
type-
writers which have had more than
five years of average usage no det-
rimental
wear, which means much
for
the
design
of
the
device and
for the good workmanship given
it.
The
combination
of
key-levers
and
type-bars
with
their
con-
necting
links,
and
the
mountings
for
the
system,
form
a
very
im-
portant
part
of
the
typewriter
details.
To
secure
a
light,
uniform
touch, with ample power for heavy manifolding work, and an absolute
alignment
of
printed
matter
always,
with
a
controlled
evenness
of
impression
can
only
be
reached
through
superior
design
and
good
construction.
The
extreme
simplicity
of
the
Underwood
key
and
type-bar system contributes much to the excellent
result obtained.
A
key-lever,
a type-bar. and
a connecting
link form the complete work-
ing combination.
Only when
this combination
is compared
with
the
same
parts
in
a
large
number
of
the
most
prominent
typewriters
now
in
use. which employ from
eight
to
sixteen
parts
for the same
service, can we
fully
realize what
'simplicity' means, and where sim-
plicity
of
design
is backed up by
the
use
of
the
best
materials and
by good construction,
the effectiveness and wearing qualities are
cer-
tainly increased.
It
is
in
this part of
the typewriter
that hard usage
will soon produce
ill
effects
if
either
the design
or the workmanship
is
faulty.

it

done without

the alignment
is materially
assisted by
the type-bar guide so
located
that
it does not interfere with the visibility of the writing while afford-
ing a perfect locking device for the type when
at the printing point,
effectually preventing any side motion of the type-bars.
The accuracy
of alignment
is further assisted by hanging the type-bars
in a slotted
segment, every
slot having been
cut by
a
specially
constructed ma-
chine,
so
perfectly
that
they
all
converge
accurately
to
a common
center.
Aside from
the
several prominent
features
herein
referred
to
at some
length,
there are
still many
essential
paits
that
in some
modified form are common
to most of the high grade typewriters of
the time.
The Underwood
lacks none of the desirable
features
that
practical use has qualified as essential to the typewriter complete.
In
all these
parts we
find
the same painstaking
simplicity and
effective
form of design.
Abundant opportunity was given the committee to examine min-
utely every
detail of
the manufacture
of
its
writing machine
at the
factory, in Hartford, Conn., where, under the most able management,
the best materials obtainable are converted by a very superior equip-
ment and through exacting workmanship
into
a
writing machine
of
extraordinary perfection
in
its minutest
details.
In
recognition
of
the very
meritorious
inventions embodied
in
the Underwood
Standard Typewriter, and
of
its exceedingly simple
and
efficient
details
of
construction,
forming
a
wriiing machine
of
the most advanced
type,
with
unsurpassed
capabilities and
excellent
make-up
throughout,
the
Institute awards
the
Elliott
Cresson
Gold
Medal
to
the Underwood
Typewriter Company,
for
the
Ingenuity,
Skill and
Perfection
of Workmanship
displayed
in
the Underwood
Typewriter.

In 1890, four or five years before the
first Underwood
was
built,
the
Hammond
Typewriter
Company
was
awarded the
Elliott Cresson Medal
for
its
shuttle
feature,
which
provides
for
the
use
of
various
languages
merely
by changing the type
shuttle.
This
is the one feature that
has
kept
the Hammond
before
the
business
world,
thus
demonstrating
the
discernment
of
the
Franklin
Institute
verdict.
Although
seven
years
have
elapsed
since
the
Elliott
Cresson Medal was
first awarded
the Underwood Type-
writer, no other typewriter has been able
to displace
it or
secure
this much coveted
prize.
This
is due
to
the
fact
that
for
ten
years
the Underwood Typewriter Company
was the
sole advocate of the front stroke
visible
principle.
During
this
time
all
of
the
best
basic
ideas
embodied
in
the
principle
of
front
stroke
visible
writing were
in-
vented and patented, and other companies were compelled
to evade these patents when
it became necessary to embody
the Underwood
idea
in
order
to
continue
their
existence.
From
the
report
of
the
Franklin
Institute
it
will
be
seen
that
the Underwood
represents
the
highest
achieve-
ment
in
typewriter
construction.
The
"History
of
the
Typewriter," by
Geo.
Carl Mares,
says with
reference
to
the progress of
visible writing: "Probably nothing
in any
mechanical
art
has been more marked
than
the progress
of
this
principle, and
in
this respect
the Underwood type-
writer would seem
to deserve
all the honours which natur-
ally
fall
to
the
successful
leader
of a
revolution."
Com-
ments concerning machines that follow are made
for veri-
fication
and
historical
information.
When the Underwood was
first placed on the market,
its many superior advantages were immediately recognized
by
an
exacting,
critical
public.
As
it grew
in
favor
it
became
the
target
of
all
competition,
against which
they
hurled
the most
absurd and
ridiculous
criticism and
pro-

79
test,
because
it embodied
the
first
radical
departure from
the primitive principle embodied
in the
first practical type-
writer.
This
strenuous
opposition,
however,
only
served
to
stimulate
the
determination
of
the
manufacturers,
for
it
demonstrated
that
competition
recognized
in
the
Underwood
a most dangerous
foe.
Besides,
in
their
ex-
cessive
zeal
to control
the typewriter
situation by
discour-
aging
the progress
of
the Underwood,
circulars were
is-
sued
to
their
managers
and
salesmen
pointing
out
the
defects,
both
real and
imaginary,
which
as
a
matter
of
course
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
Underwood
manufac-
turers,
and
served
as
a
guide
for
further
refining
and
perfecting
the
machine.
Encouraged
by
the
success
of
the
machine
and
the
vigorous,
energetic
opposition
of
competition,
the
manu-
facturers have
exerted
every
effort
that
energy,
genious,
mechanical
skill, and unlimited
capital
could command,
in
continuing
the
highest
state
of
perfection
possible
in
the
construction
of
the
typewriter.
The
opposition
to
visible
typewriting by some
of
the
older companies
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
their
attitude
as expressed in the following circular letter, dated October,
1904, sent to branch managers and salesmen:
"We are
fully aware
that there
is a
large demand
for
visible
writers, and
that
this demand
appears
to be growing.
We
are
not
asleep.
It
is our
business
to
keep
posted
about
the
wants
of
the
public, but
it
is also our business
to safe-guard
reputation
and
to
discriminate
between
passing
fancies
and
things
that
have
come to stay.
The
can take no liberties with
its reputation.
To put our name on any
visible
writer
that has yet appeared would
be taking such a
liberty.
We are and always have been experimenting along new
lines.
We have experimented
with
visible models
for
the
past
five
years.
We are seeking one worthy
of
the name
, but we are no
nearer having
it today than we were five years ago.
We may be no
nearer having
it
a
year hence than we
are
today.
We may
never

80
have
it.
But,
if not. no one else shall.
If and when
it does appear
it
will
be
ours.
We now have
several
models
that
would
tickle
the
fancy of novices, hut we have none and have seen none good enough
to
satisfy
the
vast army
of
experienced
operators
or
to
satisfy
the
man whoso money pays for the machine, and
it
is by catering to these
two
that
the name
'
' had become
great.
The machine
that
can
successfully
challenge
supremacy
has
yet
to be heard
from.
A
visible
writer may
be
the machine
for
the
future,
but
that
fact
has
yet
to
be
determined.
When
it
has
been
determined,
the
best machine
of
that
kind
will
bear
the name
'
' no matter
what
it
costs.
Meantime, with a
factor}' working night and day, and
many
thousands
of
machines

and

yearly
increase
which
is
greater
than
the
total
business
of
any
visible
writer, we
view
with
comparative
complacence
the
trade
that
such
machines
are
securing,
because we do not consider
it
lost.
Only
a part
of
it
ever
was
ours,
and
that
has
merely
strayed
away.
We.
too,
are
getting much
of
the
benefit of
their work today.
We are used
to
'bugaboos.'
We have been through
the
'shift-
less machine
scare.' and the 'wheel machine scare.' and the 'ribbonless
machine
scare."
and
the
'electric
machine
scare.'i
All
of
these
'
annihilators'
in
their
time
looked
dangerous.
Where
are
they today?
Of course
this one may be the exception.
But
it,
too.
may
fail.
If
it does, we
shall have avoided
its error and enjoyed our
success
without
interruption: but
if. on
the other hand,
it
ultimately
succeeds, we shall gobble up
its success.
If time proves their doctrine
to be
right, we
shall get the benefit of
all their work,
for you know.
and we know, and every one knows,
that
if
the
ever does
put out
a
visible writer, the
virtue of
its name, the reputation of
its
house, and
the
size and
effectiveness
of
its
organization
will
enable
the
army
to
take
by
storm
every
stronghold
that
these
feeble
fellows have
set
up.
We can
do
these
things because
of our
power;
but our power
is because
of
our
reputation, and our
repu-
tation
is because we are right, and
it
lasts because we don't
trifle with
it.
The name
'
' on any one
of
a
dozen
visible models
of
today would make an immediate
success—a temporary
success.
But
what
then ?
We
contemplate no
such
suicidal
policy.
It would
be
an abuse
of
the confidence
of
the
public, which
confidence
is based
on the
fact
that
the
name-plate has meant
for
thirty years
the
best
there
is.
The machine
to which
the name
is
attached
has
always been
the
best,
it
today
is
the
best, and
it always
will be
the
best, whatsoever model
that may
be."

L. C. SMITH & BROS.' TYPEWRITER
L.
C.
Smith,
the
leading
power
in
promoting
the
Smith Premier, and
active
in
the formation
of
the Union
Typewriter Company, was
the
first member
of
the
latter
company to openly recognize the absolute demand of the pub-
lic for visible writing. As a result he sold his interest in the
Smith
Premier Company
to
the Union
Typewriter Com-
pany and
organized
the
L.
C.
Smith &
Bros.
Company,
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
front
stroke
visible
type-
writer, which the Underwood had already demonstrated to
be
practical.
This
company
established
a
unique
reputation
for
itself
by
building
a
sales
organization
several
months
before
it had
built
a machine
for
sale.
In
other
words,
they
opened
splendidly
equipped
offices
in
many
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
United
States
before
they
had
a
machine
to
show
or
deliver.
This,
however,
served
its
purpose
as
a medium
of
advertising,
because
it
kept
the
public on the
tip-toe of expectation, and when the machine
did appear,
it was already well-established
in the minds of
buyers and
typists.
But
in
this
case
the
realization
did
not
satisfy the anticipation, because the
first models of the
L.
C.
Smith,
like
all new machines, were
in
a
crude,
ex-
perimental
stage, and
as
the
public had
already
learned
what
it
wanted,
the
defects
in
principle and
construction
were
quickly
disclosed.
This
caused
an
immediate
reac-
tion,
which
served
an
excellent
purpose
by
forcing
the
manufacturers
to make some
radical
changes
in
refining
and improving the machine.
As a
result of the reputation the Smith Brothers had
gained
as manufacturers
of
the Smith Premier, and
their
liberal policy, together with the refining effects on the new
machine, the L.
C. Smith & Bros. Typewriter soon secured
quite
a
following.

82
The
production
of
this
machine
confirmed
and
em-
phasized
all the claims
of the Underwood, and such other
improvements
as were made were along
the
lines already
incorporated
in
the
machine
which
had
established
the
front
stroke
visible
writing-
principle.
The
L.
C.
Smith
Typewriter
has
an
attractive
ap-
pearance
in
design and
finish.
The
typebars
in
the
first
machines
had
what
the
manufacturers
were
pleased
to
call
in
their
literature
"The
pivot-and-side-wall
typebar
bearing,
a
distinctive
feature,
unique
to
this
machine,
which
allows
greater
play
to
the typebar
(combined with
an absolutely accurate throw)
than any other typebar con-
struction.
In
it
the
problem
of
'permanent
alignment/
which
has
always
vexed
typewriter
manufacturers,
has
been completely solved.
The alignment of the L. C. Smith
&
Bros.
Typewriter
is POSITIVE
and
it
is PERMA-
NENT!"
Regardless of the foregoing broad
statement,
in
1907
they
discarded
this
"distinctive
feature,
unique
to
this
machine,"
and
built
a
machine
with
what
they
term
a
"ball-bearing,
long wearing
typebar."
This
feature
they
today make much
of,
but
in
order
to
control
the typebar
at
the
printing
point
they
adopted
a
type-guide.
This
guide, however,
is not very
effective,
as
the
L.
C.
Smith
is a basket
shift machine; that
is,
all of the typebar mech-
anism
is
shifted
instead
of
the
platen, when
capitals and
other upper case characters are required.
This also makes
it
necessary to
shift the guide, which cannot be done with as
little wear and the same degree of accuracy as
the
platen
shift.
The printing point on the platen is a little back of the
perpendicular
of
the typebar bearings, and as
a
result the
typebars do not recover as quickly as
the typebars on
the
Underwood, which do not pass
the perpendicular and are
compelled to return immediately by the reaction of the uni-
versal bar.

83
The
typebar
of
the
L.
C.
Smith,
in
its
action
from
the
position
of
rest
to
the
striking
point,
where
the
im-
pression
is made, describes a quarter of a
circle.
In other
words,
it
makes
one-quarter
of
a
revolution
then
drops
back into
its original
position.
It
is
just as
far from
the
position
of
rest
to
the
striking
point
as
it
is
from
the
striking
point
to
the
position
of
rest, and
as
the
typebar
does
not make
a
complete
revolution
it was
found
that
the
balls
in
the bearing returned
to
their
respective
posi-
tions.
To prevent
this the number of balls
in the bearing
was reduced from sixteen to
fifteen, thus leaving the space
of
one
ball,
which
allows
the
balls
to
advance
just
one
space each time
the typebar
strikes.
Including
the
balls
there
are
eighteen
parts
to
each
typebar bearing; there are forty-two typebars, which makes
a
total of seven hundred fifty-six parts in the bearings of
all
of the
typebars, while
in
the Underwood
there
is
just
one
part
to
all
the
typebar
bearings.
Exclusive
of
the
bearings
already
explained,
the
typebar
combination
con-
sists
of
the
typebar,
the
finger key
lever,
the
lower
con-
necting
link, a sub-connecting
link, and a
collar or sheave
between the main connecting link and the finger key lever
—five separate and distinct, active parts as compared with
three on
the Underwood.
For
years
this company
opposed
a
type-guide;
they
decried the necessity of protecting the type
face; they also
advocated
the
right-hand
carriage
return,
but
in
their
latest models they have adopted a type-guide,
a means
to
protect the type, and a left-hand carriage return (the latter
if
desired),
all
of which
features were
original
with
the
Underwood.
This
company
has
brought
out
a
number
of
models,
the
latest
being
the
No.
8,
for
which
they
claim
the
principal advantage
is
that
it makes
less
noise
than
their former product.
This
is
true, but
the changes
necessary
to
produce
this
effect
have
not
met
with
the

84
satisfactory
results
anticipated by many formerly
satisfied
users.
L.
c. SMITH
The
death
of
L.
C.
Smith,
several
years
after
the
machine was placed upon
the market, had
at
least
a tem-
porarily
detrimental
effect
upon
its
development
and
progress,
as
the organization seemed
to show
the
lack
of
his
aggressive,
determined
disposition.
L.
C.
Smith
did
much
for
the
typewriter
business,
and
his
death
was
a
blow to the entire industry.
MONARCH
The withdrawal of the Smith Brothers from the Union
Typewriter Company and the announcement of their inten-
tion
to build a
visible
typewriter
created
consternation
in
the ranks of
the Union Typewriter Company.
This com-
pany
immediately began
to
dig up
"visible
models"
with
which
they
had
been
"experimenting
for
the
past
five
years" in order to forestall the Smith Brothers in their new
enterprise.

85
The Monarch
typewriter was
the
result
of
these
ef-
forts.
It
was
thought
by many
that
the
first Monarch
was not intended to be a success, but rather to try out the
"visible experiments"
of
the Union Typewriter Company,
and
in
the meantime
hold
the
trade
until
they were
able
to produce a better machine,
or through the Monarch
dis-
credit
visible
writing.
It
appears,
however,
that
they
builded better than they knew, because the Monarch
type-
writer was received with considerable
favor, and
it served
at least to prove, rather than disprove, the demand for visible
writing, and
that
the machine
possessed more
merit than
they had anticipated.
This machine
appeared
on
the market
in
1904,
and
marked
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
"blind"
writer,
because
as
later
developments
proved,
the
Union
Type-
writer Company
immediately began
remodeling
the Rem-
ington,
the
Smith
Premier,
and
the
Yost
typewriters,
transforming them
into
visible
writers.
As
a
result
the
only
feature
recognized
after
the
transformation was
the
name-plate.
This
placed
the Union Typewriter Company
in
a
unique
position—that
of
holding on
to
the
"blind"
principle
with
one
hand
and
building
a
visible
machine
with
the
other, because both were
controlled by
the same
capital and directed by
the same management—one group
of
salesmen
advocating
visible
writing
and
another
de-
nouncing
it.
The typebar mechanism
of
the Monarch typewriter
is
quite
complicated,
there being
ten
separate
parts
as com-
pared with three on the Underwood.
(See typebars. ) The
universal bar adheres to the old Remington principle; that
is,
it
is beneath the machine, and
is operated by the finger
key
lever.
This
method
of
transmitting
power
results
in much
lost
motion.
The
typebar
bearings
are
of
the
pivotal
character
and
necessarily
wear
unevenly
on
the
side bars.
The machine
is not supplied with a guide, and
the alignment shows the lack of support of the bar
at the

S6
printing
point.
The typebar proper
is
so constructed that
it
requires
a
little
spiral
spring
to
aid
the bars
to
return
promptly from
the
printing
point, and
to prevent shadow-
ing.
These
springs
are
attached
at one end
of
the back
of each bar and
to
the
segment
at
the
other.
They
are
necessary,
not
only
to get one bar out
of
the way
of
the
other
at
the
printing
point,
but
to
prevent
the
rebound
of
the bars when
they
return
to
their
position
of
rest
in
the
basket.
MONARCH
FIRST VISIBLE TKCDrCT OF THE REMINGTON
The Monarch typewriter
is also a basket shift machine
like
the
L.
C.
Smith.
It has
a
left-hand carriage
reverse
and many other
features common
to the Underwood.
The
claim
of
the manufacturers
is
that
there
is no bar or
ob-
struction whatever
in
front
of
the machine
to prevent
the
typist from seeing
all of the work.
This, however, necessi-
tates
placing
the
marginal
stops
in
the
rear,
and
other-
wise
inconveniencing
the
typist.
Besides,
the
top
front
bars on
the Underwood and
L.
C.
Smith do not
interfere
any more with the vision of the
typist than does the space
bar
in front of the kevboard.

87
SPEED AND ACCURACY
CONTESTS
IN
TYPEWRITING
Typewriter
competition
had
become
so
active,
and
opposition
to
the
front
stroke
visible
machine
so
pro-
nounced,
that
the
manufacturers
of
the
older
"blind"
machines
sought
to prove
the
superiority
of
the
principle
of
their product by arranging
a
series
of
typewriter con-
tests.
It
is
believed
that
this
action was
largely
for
the
purpose of discrediting the front stroke machine, the
type-
bars
of which were encompassed
within
the
space
of
less
than
a
half
circle,
whereas
the
typebars
in
the
blind
machine occupied a
full
circle.
The
first
of
this
series
of
contests,
which
have been
kept up
continually
since,
took
place March
20,
1905,
in
Chicago.
The Underwood
did
not enter.
To force the issue, however, and bring the Underwood
out,
another
contest was
arranged
in
the
same
year
for
October
31,
held
in Madison Square
Garden, New York
City.
The one hour
dictation
contest was won by
Miss
Mae
Carrington;
Miss
Rose
L.
Fritz,
then
just
out
of
school,
second,
both
using Underwood
typewriters.
This
was
a blindfold championship
contest.
For
the American
Typewriting Championship (copying) two elimination con-
tests were held, one for
five minutes and the other for ten
minutes,
Miss
Rose
L.
Fritz
winning
both,
using
the
Underwood;
Mr.
Paul
Munter,
second,
using
the
Rem-
ington
; Miss Mae Carrington, third, using the Underwood
;
and Mr. Chas. M. Nelson,
fourth, using the
L.
C.
Smith.
In
both
of
these
elimination
contests
the
typists
stood
in
the
same
order,
Miss
Fritz
winning
at
the
rate
of
73
words a minute, and Mr. Munter, her nearest
competitor,
at
59.
In
the
final
thirty
minute
contest,
however,
Paul
Munter was
first
at
70 words
a
minute and
Miss
Fritz
second,
at
69 words
a
minute.

88
Fixed
rules
at
that
time, however, had not been
defi-
nitely
established,
and
Miss
Fritz
lost
the
first
position
only
because
she
repeated
23
words
for which
she was
penalized
five words
for each word
repeated.
Even
with
this
penalty Miss
Fritz
lost
by
only
15
words, when
in
fact
she had
written
correctly
100 more words
than
her
nearest competitor.
Today,
according-
to the revised
rules
of 1917, a typist
is not penalized for a repetition
if
it does
not
contain
an
error.
In
1906,
Office
Appliances,
in
order
to
promote
an
unbiased
interest
in
these
contests,
offered
a
cup,
which
was
to
become
the
personal
property
of
the
winner
in
three consecutive contests.
This was
first competed
for
in
Chicago, March
23,
1906, and won by Miss
Fritz,
using
the Underwood, at the rate of 76 net words a minute
; her
nearest
competitor,
using the Remington,
wrote
64 words
a minute.
On November
first
of
the same
year,
1906,
this
cup
was again competed
for
in Madison Square Garden, New
York, and won
for
the second time by Miss
Fritz
at
the
rate
of 82
net words
a
minute.
In
1907, March
21,
in
Chicago,
this
cup
was won
for the
third time by Miss
Fritz with
a record
of 82
net
words
a
minute,
the cup thereby becoming her permanent
property.
In
the meantime such
interest had been shown by
so
many manufacturers, such
as the Underwood, Remington,
Monarch, Fay-Sho, Smith Premier, L.
C.
Smith, Fox, and
other typewriters,
all of which had taken part
in
the con-
tests,
that
Office
Appliances,
a
magazine
published
in
Chicago
in
the
interest
of
office
efficiency,
conceived
the
idea
of
offering a permanent
trophy on
a
broader
basis.
In other words, they took
steps
to arrange
for a World's
Typewriting
Championship
Trophy,
to
be
competed
for
annually
in New
York.

was
to
be
awarded
the
winner
and
his name
engraved
on the cup, which was to be held
in trust from one contest
to the next by the company manufacturing the machine on
which
it was
won.
They
submitted
their
proposition
to
all
of
the
leading
typewriter
companies,
who
not
only
gave
their
approval
but
subscribed
to
a
fund
for
pur-
chasing
this cup, which was
specially designed and manu-
factured
at
a
cost
of more than
a thousand
dollars.
The
contests
for
this
cup
were
open
to
typists
of
the
whole
world.
Experience had demonstrated that the rules governing
these
contests
should
be
revised
to
cover
every
error,
whether
mechanical,
mental,
or
physical.
A
mechanical
error
is
due
to
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
machine
to respond
in any way, such as piling, crowding,
skipping,
breaking,
etc.
A
mental
error
is
a
failure
on
the
part
of the typist
to read copy
correctly,
a
repetition, an omis-
sion,
or
the improper
division
of a word
at
the end
of a
line.
A physical error
is a misstruck key, failure to return
carriage to zero to begin the line, misuse of shift key, incor-
rect spacing (either physical or mechanical), etc.
The World's Championship Cup was competed for the
first time in Madison Square Garden, New York, October 17,
1907, and was won by Miss Rose
L.
Fritz
at the
rate
of
87
net
words
a
minute;
Mr.
H.
O.
Blaisdell,
second,
writing 83 words
a
minute,
both
using
the Underwood;
Emil Trefzger,
third,
using
the Remington.
In
1908, October 22, at Madison Square Garden, New
York,
this
International
Trophy
was
competed
for
the
second time and again won by Miss Fritz at 87 net words
a minute, using the Underwood.
In
1909,
September
30,
at Madison
Square
Garden,
New York, Miss
Fritz, using the Underwood, won the cup
for the third time at the rate of 95 net words a minute.

90
In consequence of Miss Fritz having won the World's
Championship
Trophy
three
successive
times,
and
about
thirty
other championship medals and
prizes,
her
services
were in such demand all over the world that she had to aban-
don
contest work
for
the
purpose
of
giving
exhibitions,
which she did, not only in the United States and Canada, but
all over Europe.
Miss
Fritz was the
first
to demonstrate
the
infinite
superiority
of
touch
typewriting
over
the
old
sight, "hit and miss" method, and her pioneer work in the
practical
development
of
typewriting
cannot
be
over-esti-
mated.
In
19 io, October 2j, at Madison Square Garden, New
York, this World's Championship Trophy was won by Mr.
H.
O.
Blaisdell, using the Underwood,
at
the
rate
of
109
net words a minute.
In 191 1, October 26, at Madison Square Garden, New
York, Mr. H.
O.
Blaisdell again won
the
contest
for
the
World's Trophy
at
the
rate
of
112
net words
a
minute,
using the Underwood.
In
1912, November
12,
at the 69th Regiment Armory,
New York, the World's Typewriting Championship Trophy
was
won
by
Miss
Florence
E.
Wilson,
using
the
Underwood,
at
the
rate
of
117 net words
a minute; Emil
A.
Trefzger, who had
joined
the Underwood
forces,
sec-
ond,
with
116;
H.
O.
Blaisdell,
also
using
the
Underwood,
115.
In
19 1 3,
October
21,
at
the
69th
Regiment Armory,
New
York,
the
World's
Typewriting
Trophy
was
won
by Miss Margaret
B. Owen, using the Underwood,
at the
rate of 125 net words a minute.
The second, third, fourth,

were
held
by
typists
using

next four positions held by the Underwood, the sixth posi-
tion going to the Remington.
In
191 5,
October
25,
at
the 69th Regiment Armory,
New York, Miss Margaret B. Owen, using the Underwood,
again won
the World's Championship Trophy
at
the phe-
nomenal rate of 136 net words a minute with only 42 errors.
In
1916, October
16, Miss Margaret
B. Owen, using
the
Underwood,
again
won
the
World's Championship
Trophy, breaking her previous
record by writing
137 net
words a minute.
A photographic reproduction of a part of
Miss Owen's work in this contest appears on the following
page.
In 191 7, October 15, at the 69th Regiment Armory, Miss
Margaret B. Owen, using the Underwood typewriter, won
the World's Championship
for
the
fourth
time
at an
in-
creased
net
rate
of
speed,
breaking
all
previous
records,
writing
143
net words
a minute.
This demonstrates
that
Miss Owen
is
today
the
undisputed
World's
Champion
Typist.
Miss Owen appreciates the value of accuracy, and her
records have been made because of the
fact
that she does
not
sacrifice accuracy
for
speed.
She knows
that
a
busi-
ness
letter
that
is
written
at
a very
high
rate
of
speed,
filled
with
errors,
will
be
returned
because
the
business
man,
in
attaching
his
signature
to
a
letter
containing
errors, assumes
all responsibility for such
errors.
In
this contest Miss Owen wrote two
full pages with
but two errors, one on each page, copy of one of which
is
shown on page 93.
This copy
is reduced to
fit the page of
this book.

state

as
i
have known
hira,
his voice
is
like
that which you would
imagino might
ccmo
from
the
bottom of Hades
when the lid
is
off and there
is
a row
going on
down thera.
All these talents,
as you
77111 see,
place
him in a class
by himself
ajd. he
is
the very
last word
so
far
as cats
go.
It was
a thing like
that which raised
the
hair
on
the
back
of Ruin and
which lay on the
limb
of that
big pine
Just ahead of us.
Had
we
gone
on
our way and
taken no notice
of him
I doubt
if we should have
hi erd any-
thing from him for he
was wise enough
to know that while he might damage
U3
in a rough and
tumble
fight yet
in
the
long run
the
two of us would
be too many for
him.
But
wo did not
go
on for Ruin and
I were
of one
mind,
we would have a round with that bobcat
let what
would
come of it.
It
wa3
the open season for game
and
as a rule
I carried a gun with me
and
had fairly good success with it but
I
had not
taken
it
that morning as
we had planned a final hunt
for the afternoon and wanted to finish our
«ork and get back to camp as soon as we could do
so.
I looked about
for a stick or stone but
could
find none and
so
I walked
on a few steps
at a
time and Ruin did
the
same, always with one
eye
on me and
the other
on the
cat,
until we
got
to within forty feet of
the
pine.
Ruin was no
coward
and
I knew that
he wanted to come
to hand grip3 with the
cat but
I
also knew that
at best
the
dog would
bo
torn more or
less
to
tatters
and
I
did
not
want that for he was ragged enough as he was without any
additions*
»'e crept
on,
our feet making no noise on the soft carpet of
pine needles and
the
only sound that broke the
stillness was a soft hiss
from
the
cat
or
a low growl from Ruin.
When we
reached
a point about
thirty feet from the
tree
the cat no doubt thought of the maxim
I have
quoted,
for giving vent
to one last spit he
jumped free and clear twenty
feet from his
roost and was
off in long leaps
as fast
as hi3
legs would
carry him, with Ruin close behind him and filling the
air with hi3 short
yelps.
I went back and got my transit and then made my way to where
the boys
had driven the
last stake
in our survey;
it was
at the highest point on
the mountain and
as we
got our tools
together we could hear Ruin
on the
track of the
cat
as the latter tried to throw
the dog off tho
scent by
running around
the
hill.
We hid our stuff under a bush for we
could
oome back and
got
it
later, whereas
the
cat must
be
looked after at one©
if we wished to look after
it
at all, and we wanted
to
be
on
the. job if
Ruin should catch up with the
beast for we knew
tho dog would
tackle an
elephant when he
got
his mad
up
and
we also had
soma
idea of the kind of

No mention
thus
far has been made
of
the Amateur
Championship, which differs from the Professional only
in
point
of
time,
the Amateur
being
for
one-half
hour
and
the Professional for one hour
; both, however, being written
from the same copy at the same time.
Mr.
George
L.
Hossfeld,
winner
of
the
Amateur
Championship
contest
in
191 7,
established
a
record which
justifies mention, because
it proves
the
possibilities
of
the
typewriter.
Mr.
Hossfeld,
using
the
Underwood
type-
writer, wrote
145
net words
a minute
for
thirty minutes.
This means
after
five words had been deducted
for every
error.
In winning
this championship Mr.
Hossfeld wrote
at
the
rate
of
152 words
a minute, one page
of which
is
without
error.
In other words,
for over
four minutes he
wrote at the rate of 152 words a minute,
perfect, which
is
the
highest
record
ever made
in
open
competition
even
for one minute only.
The reproduction
of Mr.
Hossfeld's
work,
bearing
the
signature
of
approval
of
Mr.
J.
N.
Kimball, Contest Manager, appears on page 95.
Thus
for
eleven
consecutive
years,
typists
using
the
Underwood have won and held
the World's
International
Trophy, purchased by
all
the typewriter companies and
of-
fered under the auspices of Office Appliances.
The rate of
speed attained
in
these
contests has been nothing
short of
phenomenal.
Exclusive of the return of the carriage, which
was
more
than
five
hundred
times,
not
including
the
shift
key
for
capitals
and
other
upper
case
characters,
and
not
considering
the
insertion
of
sixteen
sheets
of
paper, and turning
twenty-five
sheets
of
copy,
the
typists
have
written
at
the
rate
of more than
eleven
strokes
per
second for three thousand six hundred consecutive seconds.
Emil A.
Trefzger, winner
of
the
first endurance con-
test held
in Chicago, March
20,
1905, writing 90 minutes
from
copy and 90 minutes from
dictation
at
the
rate
of
62

Mr.
Trefzger
continued
to
use
this
machine
until
the
year
1908, when
he
began
using
the Underwood.
The
following
year,
operating
the
Underwood,
he
competed
in
London
for
the
English
Championship,
and won
the
contest regardless of the unusual conditions imposed, which
consisted
in copying twenty minutes from
printed matter,
writing
from
dictation
for
twenty
minutes,
and
copying
from
pen-written
lithographed
manuscript
for
fifteen
minutes.
In
addition
to winning
this
contest and cup
in
1909,
Mr.
Trefzger
returned and won
it
under
similar
condi-
tions
in
1910, and again
in
1912,
there being no
contest
held
in
191 1.
The terms of the contest were that the cup
became
the
personal
property
of
the
contestant who won
three
consecutive
contests.
A
sample
of
the
manuscript
from
which
Mr.
Trefzger
copied
is
given
on
page
97;
It
was
required
that
all abbreviations
be translated
and
written in
full.
A fac-simile reproduction of a paragraph of
printed matter copied by Mr. Trefzger, follows:
The Commissioners were Lord
Balfour
of
Burleigh (Chairman)
and
Sir
John
Dickson
Poynder (now Lord Islington and Governor
of
New Zealand), representing Great Britain,
(he
Hon. W.
S.
Fielding and
the Hon.
William
Paterson, for Canada,
and
Sir Daniel
Morris,
as representing the West Indian Colonies.
In
a
letter
of
instructions
addressed
to
the
Commissioners by the Earl of Crewe
(Colonial
Secretary) it is laid down that the term British
West Indies includes " Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and British Honduras, in addition to the British
West Indian
Islands, as usually so-called, and
British Guiana "
; and
the Commissioners
are
informed
that
"His
Majesty's
Government
have
undertaken
that
in
any
arrangement
which may be arrived at between Canada and
the West Indies due regard will be had
to the
interests of Newfoundland."

REMINGTON NO.
10
The
first practical typewriter was known as the Rem-
ington.
This machine was
introduced
to
a
critical
public
nearly
a
half century
ago.
The name Remington,
there-
fore,
is recognized as the pioneer
in
the typewriter world,
and
great
credit
is
due
it
for
the
educational
work
it
accomplished
in
converting
the
public
from
criticism
to
appreciation
of
the
value
of
the
typewriter.
The
success
of
the Remington
typewriter,
the
evolution
of which was
stimulated
by
various
imitators,
was
so marked
that
its
manufacturers were loath to abandon the understroke prin-
ciple of the blind
writer.
For many
years
the Remington
enjoyed
the
distinc-
tion of being the best typewriter,
not only because
it was
the
first,
but
because
it
actually
led
in
all
essential
re-
quirements
possible
in
the manufacture
of
the
blind
type-
writer.
After the public had become educated to the value
of
the
typewriter,
however, many
users
of
the machine
saw
possibilities
of
improvements
and
suggested
many,
principal
among
which
was
visible
writing.
Although
numerous suggestions were adopted, that of visible writing
was
deemed
impractical
from
the
manufacturers'
stand-
point, because
it required
so many changes
in
the forma-
tion
of
the machine;
in
fact,
a
complete
remodeling.
The desire
of
the
typist
for
visible
writing, however,
finally
developed
into
an
actual
demand,
to
which
the
Underwood and other machines had already responded.
The
success of the visible writer was so marked and the confirma-
tion by
public
opinion
so pronounced
that
the Remington
typewriter was
finally compelled
to
surrender, and
reluct-
antly
accept and advocate
the
principle
it had
so
strenu-
ously opposed
for
so many years.

100
The name "Remington"
in
the
typewriter world had
become
famous,
and
the
anticipation
following
the
an-
nouncement
of
a
"visible
writing
Remington"
was
the
cause
of much
speculation.
But
the Remington Company
had opposed the demand of
typists and the business public
too
long,
and
as
a
result, when
they were
compelled
to
accede
to the demand
for a
visible writer they found
that
the most
practical
features
required
in
such
construction
had already been
employed, and
their
effort
to
evade
in-
fringement
necessarily complicated
their machine.
After
the
Remington
had
"seen
the
light,"
and
the
transformation
had
taken
place,
there
was
little
left
by
which
it
could
be
identified
except
the
name-plate.
The
typebar combination,
instead of being
simplified was more
complicated, employing about double
the number
of
parts,
and the frictional points increased from three to five.
Steel
finger key
levers were
substituted
for
the wooden
levers
of
which
they had made
such
a
strong
feature
in
their
blind
writers.
The
power
was
no
longer
transmitted
direct from the
finger key lever through
a
single connect-
ing
link
to
the
typebar, but through
a
connecting
link
to
a bell-crank, thence through another connecting link to the
typebar.
This
increased
lost motion, and
resulted
in
less
speed
in
the return
of
the typebar,
to overcome which,
in
fast writing,
it was necessary
to employ
a
part known
as
the
"repulser."
As
has
been
stated
before,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
these steps to point out defects or
deficiencies
in any
type-
writer, but rather
to
direct
attention
to
all important
fea-
ures
that mark an
advance
in
the
evolution
of
the
type-
writer.
Inasmuch, however,
as the Remington Typewriter
Company
claim
a "new
self-starting Remington,"
it may
be
interesting
to
the reader
to know
the
truth concerning
this.
In
the
first
place,
they
have
built
no new
model
since
1908.
They have simply recognized and tried to cor-

101
rect
mistakes
in
their
original
visible
model.
The
"self-
starter"
is not
a new
feature,
as
it was embodied
in
the
first No.
10 Remington typewriter
in
1908, but
it was then
called
the "column
selector."
REMINGTON No.
10
It
is
true,
the
No.
10 Remington
has been improved
since
it was
first
submitted
to
the
public.
For
example:
Their
first machine had the double wheel escapement with
a
single
loose
dog.
This was
soon
found
to
be
imprac-
tical, and they returned
to the time tested principle of the
single
wheel
and
two
dogs.
Both
dogs,
however,
are
loose.
They
also
made many
other
alterations,
among
which was
the
change
in name
of
"column
selector"
to
"self-starter."
This
term,
popularized by
the
automobile
industry, was appropriated by
the Remington
simply
as
a
catch
phrase.
The machine
does
not have
a
self-starter;
it starts the same as all machines—by a touch of the finger
and the feature to which they give the name
"self-starter"
is
in
fact a
self-stopper, but
this name being
literal
is too

102
significant.
It
matters
not,
however,
whether
it
be
a
column
selector,
self-starter,
or
self-stopper,
it
embodied
the
principle
of
the
Gathright
Tabulator
patents
which
were owned and
controlled by the Underwood, and could
only be used by other machines on payment
of a
royalty
to the Underwood until the patents expired. (See tabulators.)
The transformation of the Remington from a blind to
a
visible
writer
definitely
and
conclusively
confirmed
all
the
claims
of
the Underwood,
which
not
only
served
to
establish the
latter machine more
firmly
in
the
estimation
of
the
public,
but
to
acknowledge
its
leadership
in
the
typewriter
world.
SMITH PREMIER NO.
10
The
federal
laws
restricting
trusts and
other
combi-
nations apparently made
it necessary for the Union Type-
writer Company
to
claim
its
own,
and
sell
its
products
from
one
general
headquarters,
and
not
from
different
points
apparently
in
competition
with
each
other.
The
Remington,
the
Smith
Premier,
and
the
Monarch
were
therefore
brought
together,
and
the
Smith
Premier
of
necessity was also transformed into a visible writer.
The
first model of the Smith Premier Visible was, as
all
first models
are,
very
crude,
and some
vital
changes
were
necessary,
one
of which was
the
so-called
"target,"
which actuated the escapement.
In other words,
the uni
versal bar was brought up to the type end
of
the typebar.
Theoretically,
this was good, but
practically
it was not
a
success, and as a
result
it became necessary
to change the
position of the universal bar.
The Smith Premier as a blind machine had doubtless the
best method
of
cleaning
the
type,
but
the
visible
Smith
Premier has possibly the most difficult method of cleaning the
type—they are hard to get at with the brush; besides, there

103
are two sets.
The ribbon is very difficult to place in position.
The machine, however, recognizes and emphasizes the value
of visible writine.
»5'
The No.
10 Smith Premier has no
special advantages
over
the
old
blind model
except
the
visible
feature which
the evolution of the typewriter forced
it
to adopt.
It
still
has
the
double keyboard, which compels
a change
in
the
bearings
to accommodate them
to
the reduced
space on a
front
stroke
machine.
It now
has
ball-bearing
typebars,
and being a Remington product, this places the company in
a
position
that
is
quite
inconsistent,
that
of
advocating
three
different
styles
of
machine—the
Remington,
with
pivotal
typebar
bearings,
a
single keyboard, and carriage
shift
for
capitals;
the
Smith
Premier
with
ball-bearing
typebars
and
a
double
keyboard
(a
key
for
each
char-
acter)
; and the Monarch with a
single keyboard and bas-
ket
shift
for

SMITH PREMIER No.
10
To
further accommodate
the
typebars
of
the
Smith
Premier to the space allotted them,
it
is necessary to make
them
in
two
lengths,
the
short
bars
being hung
three-
quarters
of
an
inch
above
the
lower
or
long
bars.
In

104
order
to
equalize
the
touch
and
impression,
the
type
on
the
short
bars
should
be made
heavier.
This
is
not
the
case, however.
The power necessary
to operate the
type-
bar embodies the same
principle as that of "horse power,"
the universal term used in mechanics, which includes
force,
distance,
and
time.
To
equalize
the
time,
which
is
the
most
essential,
the
leverage
in
the two
sets
of bars must
differ,
which
affects
the
touch,
or
power,
and
speed
ac-
cording
to
the
principle
involved
in
"horse
power."
The
Smith
Premier
is no
longer
popular among
the
best
typists
principally
because
of
its
double
keyboard,
which
is an objectionable feature for touch typewriting, the
method almost universally taught
in
schools
at the present
time.
It
is
only
the
older and
slower
operators who use
the
sight
method
in
typewriting,
and
to
these
the
evo-
lution
of
the
typewriter would
not
appeal.
YOST MODEL A (Visible)
The
Yost
typewriter,
being
a member
of
the Union
Typewriter
family,
immediately
followed
suit
in changing
YOST MODEL A

105
its
blind machine
to a
visible
writer.
The
result
of
their
effort
to
retain some
of
the
features which
the Yost had
employed
in
the
blind
writer
is
really
interesting,
not on
account of
its
efficiency, but as an example
of mechanical
possibilities.
The
typebar
combination
requires
fourteen
separate active parts.
The inventor must indeed have had
a wonderful mind
to solve a problem involving such mar-
velous intricacy.
(See diagram, page 140.)
There are ten
frictional
points
in
this typebar combination, which
is one
of
the
most
complicated
of
any
machine.
The
blind Yost
typewriter was
a
pad
machine,
and
this feature
is retained
in the
visible.
In order
to do
this
it
is
necessary
for
the
type
to
lie
face down
on
the pad
directly beneath the writing line, exposed to
all the erasure
and
office
dust.
To
lift the type from
the inking pad,
or
position
of
rest,
to
the
point
of
contact
with
the
paper,
where
the
impression
is
made,
four
definite and
distinct
movements
are
necessary.
The
type
are
lifted
up,
back,
up, and forward to the printing point.
The typebar
itself,
as may be seen, is composed of three parts, one of which holds
the type, and another serves both as a lever and a hammer to
lift the part holding the type and to strike
it in the back to
make the impression.
On account of the position of the type
lying face downward,
it
is extremely difficult to clean them.
It would be
difficult
to even
attempt
to
describe
the
complexity
of
this typebar
construction,
or anv
other
fea-
tures
of the machine, except
that
it changed from
a
blind
to
a
visible
writer,
and
from
a
double
to
a
single
key-
board.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the machine marks no
step
in the evolution
of
the
typewriter, hence
it could not
find
a market
in
the United
States, and
practically
the
entire
product
is
consumed
abroad.
ROYAL
The Royal
typewriter
is
a machine with
a checkered
career.
Its
first appearance on
the market was
in
1906,

106
and
it was current comment
at that time that the machine
was designed and
built
for
the purpose
of
forcing a
fur-
ther
combination
of
typewriters,
which
the
Underwood
had practically succeeded
in breaking up.
It was not suc-
cessful,
however.
It
did
not
possess
sufficient
merit
at
that time
to
attract
public
attention
to
the
extent
that
it
would
disturb other manufacturers.
Two
models
were
built,
one
known
as
the
Royal
Grand,
and
the
other
the
Royal
Standard.
The
former
sold
for one hundred
dollars,
or
at
least
it was
so
listed,
but
for
reasons
best known
to
the
manufacturer
it was
soon
withdrawn
from
the
market.
The
latter,
however,
was continued
at
a
list
price
of
sixty-five
dollars.
ROYAL STANDARD
The company adopted a very suggestive
slogan, "You
can pay more,
but you
can't buy more."
The
price and
the
aggressiveness
of
the
company
attracted
some
little
attention.
It was
found,
however,
that
a
typewriter
of
quality
could not
be made and
sold
at
a
price
less
than
one
hundred
dollars
without
loss
to
the
manufacturer.
The
result was,
the company
built another model,
No.
5,
in which were incorporated the back-spacer,
the
tabulator,
and
the bichrome
ribbon, and
increased
the
price
to
sev-

107
enty-five
dollars.
These added
features
already
being
in
use
on
all
the
older
machines
served
to
discredit
their
slogan.
Still
this machine
did not measure up
to
the
re-
quirements
of
either
the
typist
or
the
business man, and
another
change
became
necessary.
This
time
the machine was changed
in
form,
model,
and
price.
It was
built higher
to conform,
as
they
said,
"to generally
accepted appearance
in
typewriter
construc-
tion, and would be sold at the standard price of one hundred
dollars." They called this the No. 10 model, but aside from
the change in form, practically the only improvement was the
automatic reverse of the ribbon.
The manufacturers found
that changing
the
form
of
the
machine and
raising
the
price did not conform with their slogan.
This had served
an
excellent purpose
in
the
sale
of
the machine
at
sixty-
five
dollars,
but
it
became
retroactive
with
the
change,
which may
account
for
the many
reports
that
the
com-
pany
is
unable
to
secure
list
price.
In
introducing
the
Royal Typewriter No.
10, through Office Appliances in the
June
issue
of
1914,
the company
says:
'The
introduction
of
the
first
model
of
the
Royal
Typewriter
was
attended
by
the
discouragement
which
always
follows
the
production
of
any
machine,
for
any
purpose, which does not conform
in appearance with
that
which the
public
is
familiar."
"The
public, once used
to a certain form, gives
slight
response at
first to the suggestion of change.
.
.
.
But
the
public,
although
slow
in
response
to
change,
does
always
in good time
accept what was once
considered an
innovation,
provided
it
have
merit."
"When the typewriter which
first put writing in sight
of
the operator was
introduced,"
(the Underwood)
"and
which machine was essentially different from older models,
the
public
was
not
so
sure
it
wanted
a
machine
that
differed in construction from the kind to which
it had been

108
accustomed.
The
machine
did
not
look
like
those
with
which the public was acquainted.
But presently the public
would have no machine
that
did not embody
the
principle
of the writing
in
sight of the operator."
"The
first
model
of
the
Royal
resembled
no
other
typewriter.
It
did not conform
to
the
generally accepted
lines
of
typewriter
construction,
and
the
manufacturers
had
to be content with the psychological disadvantage."
From
this statement
it would appear
that
the No.
10
Royal was introduced
principally
for
the purpose
of "con-
ROYAL No.
10
forming
with
the
appearance
of
other
typewriters,"
and
of enabling them
to
sell
it
"at
the
standard
price
of one
hundred
dollars."
The No.
i and No.
2 Royal Standards
gave way
to the No.
5 with an advance
of
ten
dollars
in
price.
The No.
5 was
succeeded by
the No.
10 with an
advance of twenty-five
dollars, catalog
price.
The No.
10
begins
with
the
serial number where
the
No.
5
left
off,
and the No.
5 where the No.
2 was discontinued.
While
the outward
conformation
of
the
machine
re-
sembled
the
Underwood,
and
other
visible
writers
that
had preceded
it.
its
interior or vital working parts did not
conform
with
those
of any
other
machine.
The
typebar
combination,
as shown by diagram, page
136,
is composed

109
of
eight
parts.
The
link
or
links
connecting
the
finger
key lever with the typebar proper has
five parts, consisting
of
a
series
of
bent
wires.
The back
wire,
the
one
that
operates
the
universal
bar,
is
encased
in
a
spiral
spring
hooked
into
the
frame
at
one
end and
a
section
of
the
links
at the other.
This
is
for the purpose of assisting
in
taking up
lost
motion.
The
fragile mechanism
of
the machine
is
encased
in
plate
glass.
This,
it
is
claimed,
is
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
dust
out,
but
the
real
reason,
it
is
believed,
is to prevent the
typist's cleaning brush and the inspection
of
the exacting buyer from
getting
at
the
frangible
con-
struction.
NOISELESS
The
Noiseless
typewriter
is
a machine
that
deserves
mention.
Of
course,
it
is
a
visible
machine,
and
it
is
really noiseless.
But while
this noiseless
feature
is appre-
ciated
in some
offices,
to
secure
it numerous
sacrifices
of
other
important
features
are
necessary,
which
makes
it
undesirable
in
the great majority of busy business
orifices.
The
type
are
arranged
in
a
fan-like
formation,
three
characters on each bar, and by means of an actuating arm
are
"pushed"
horizontally
from
their
position
of
rest
a
distance
of
about
two
inches
to
the
printing
point,
and
when
they
reach the
printing
point
the
force
that
impels
them has been
expended.
There
is
a
steel
bar
that
ex-
tends
along
between
the
cylinder
and
the
printing
line
on
the paper
to give
a
solid
printing
surface.
The typebars
in
their forward movement
slide
into
a
guide
that
is
not
adjustable, and
the
surface
over which
they slide is not only exposed to dust, but they have five fric-
tional points which cause
the sluggish
return
of
the
bars.
The
return
of
these bars
on
the new
machine
is
caused

110
by a tension spring and
a balancing weight.
These must
be
evenly
and
accurately
adjusted
because
the
least
ten-
sional
friction
greatly
retards
the
return
of
the
bars.
In
front
of
the
machine
there
is
a
dial
graduated
from o
to
1 6.
On
this
dial
there
is an
indicator
which,
when
set
at
o,
is
intended
to
adjust
the
position
of
the
cylinder
for
writing on one
sheet
of
paper.
As
the
dial
is advanced, the cylinder
is forced back.
This
is supposed
to provide
for
a number of
sheets
of carbon and
to give
the same pressure on each
sheet from one
to
sixteen; but
it does not, for the reason that the number of sheets serve
as a cushion which prevents the final pressure and
nullifies
the
purpose
of
the
steel
bar.
This
adjustment,
however,
prevents
battering
the
face
of
the
type
against
the
steel
bar back of the printing point.
Because of the impression
being made by a push rather than a blow, the effect
is not
good.
A
quick, sharp blow
of a few ounces
will produce
a
better carbon copy than the pressure
of several pounds.
It would
be
difficult
indeed
to
describe
or
define
the
typebar and
its action of the Noiseless
typewriter, but
the
reader can perhaps draw his own conclusions by referring
to
the diagram
of
the
typebar
on
page
138.
It
should
be remembered
also
that
the
construction
of
the
typebar
is
the
all-important
feature
of
all
typewriters.
The marginal stops and the tabular stops are both on
the same
rack
in
the
back,
and
they
are
very
inconven-
iently
set.
It
is
necessary
to
adjust
them
according
to
a graduated
scale on
the
paper
shelf,
which
agrees with
the
scale on the cylinder.
These
stops being on
the same
rack
interfere
with
the
adjustment
of
each
other.
It
is
often necessary
to move both
to
adjust
one.
The keyboard
is
not
universal from
the
fact
that
it
has two
shift keys, one
for
capitals, and the other
for the
numerals and many
of
the
special
characters.
This
will
always make
the
machine
unpopular
with
touch
typists.

Ill
The machine
is very much heavier than other machines as
the
result of the thick casting- of which the frame
is com-
posed
for
the purpose
of
reducing
the
noise.
The
efforts
of
the
manufacturers
of
the
Noiseless
machine
are
commendable, but
the
results
will
not meet
the requirements
of
the modern business
office.
It
is
the
author's
contention
that whatever
the mind
conceives
the
hand can
execute.
In
other words,
the conception
of
the
mind
is
a
prophecy
of
the
possibility
of
its
accomplish-
ment.
However,
as
with
the
typewriter
itself,
it
often
takes
a long time
for
the
realization
of a prophecy.
The
mental conception of the typewriter, formulated more than
two
centuries
ago,
was
in
the
process
of
evolution
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
the
first
practical
type-
writer
was
built,
and
then
only
in
a
very
crude
form.
Therefore,
the noiseless machine may
in time develop
into
NOISELESS
a practical typewriter, but as
it
is today
it has many
diffi-
culties
to
overcome,
before
it
will
meet
the
requirements
of
the
exacting business
public.

112
VICTOR
Supplementing
the
efforts
of
the
Underwood
in
its
early
days
to
educate
the
business world
to
the
value
of
visible
writing-,
several
machines were
built
along
similar
lines, and each served
its purpose by
confirming
the
front
stroke
visible
principle made
popular
by
the Underwood.
Some
of
these machines
that
should be mentioned are
the
Secor,
the
Stearns,
the Fox
Visible,
and
in
fact
all ma-
chines
that were
built embodying the principle of the front
stroke
visible
writer.
Among
this number
is
also
the
Victor.
The
strong
claim
of
the
manufacturers
of
this
machine
is
the
wide
pivotal typebar bearings, and
in
this
respect the individual
pivotal bearing
for each typebar
is wider than the bearing
of any
other
machine
with
similar
bearings,
but
it
does
not
have
any
other
feature
that
would
especially
recom-
mend
it.
In
fact,
its
ribbon
control
is
crude,
and
is
in
the way
oi
the
typist.
There
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
face of one type from striking against the back of another,
which
at times cannot be avoided even by
the most
skilled
typist.
The breaking or battering of the type causes irreg-
ular,
imperfect
impressions,
and
spoils
the
appearance
of
the work.
This defect was provided against
in the earliest
model
of
the Underwood,
but
its
value
has
only
recently
been confirmed by such machines
as
the Remington,
L.
C.
Smith.
Royal, and others.
CORONA
The
purpose
of
this machine
primarily, and
it might
be
said
finally,
is
portability.
It
is
the outgrowth
of
the
Folding
Typewriter;
in
fact,
it
is
a
folding
typewriter
the carriage and upper framework
folding down
over
the
keyboard when
not
in
use.
thus making
a
compact
form
for
carrying.

113
The machine has a double
shift,
that
is, one
shift
for
capitals, and
the
other
for
figures and
special
characters.
It
is
attractive,
and
does good work
to
the
limit
of
its
capacity, but
its capacity
is quite limited as compared with
machines that are designed and built
for heavy,
fast
office
work.
For
the
purpose,
however,
that
it
is
intended,
it
meets
the
requirements
quite
satisfactorily.
It
advanced
no
new
ideas
other
than
the
folding
feature,
which
is
essential
for
convenience
in
carrying,
and
to
accomplish
this
it
is
necessary
to
sacrifice
other
features common on
better machines.
EMPIRE
This
is
a machine
of numerous names.
It
is manu-
factured
in
Montreal,
Canada, where
it
is known
as
the
Empire;
in
the
United
States,
the
Wellington;
and
in
Europe, where
it
is made under
license
to
a Mr.
Adler,
it
bears
his name.
This machine
is
not mentioned
as
a
step
in
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter
because
it
pos-
sesses no new ideas that are especially commendable, but
it
has some
considerable
following
in
Canada
and
Europe,
hence the consideration.
The
typebar
construction
of
the
Empire-Wellington-
Adler
is peculiar and quite complicated.
The typebars
rest
on
a
flat surface and are pushed forward
to
the
printing
point, a distance of about two
inches,
into a guide, where
the type are held
securely.
It
is claimed
for
this machine
that
it has a universal keyboard.
This
is not true, however,
The
recognized
universal keyboard
has
a
single
shift,
or
at least two
shifts, one on each
side, that may be operated
by
either hand, but the
function
of both
is the same, and
it
is
not
necessary
to
shift
for
figures
or many
of
the
special
characters.
In
other
words,
in
using
all
of
the
characters on
the standard universal keyboard
it
is neces-
sary to use the shift key just half as many times as would

114
be required
in using
all
of
the characters on
the Empire-
Wellington-Adler.
It
is claimed
that
the typebars do not
move as far as on most other machines.
This
is true, but
it
is
also
true
that
they do
not move
nearly
so
fast
be-
cause
of
the
friction on
the
surface upon which the
type-
bars
rest
and move,
and
the
lack
of
gravitation.
It
is evident that the typebar of the Empire suggested
the typebar construction embodied in the Noiseless.
EDISON
The Edison typewriter was designed expressly by the
manufacturers
of
the
Edison
Mimeograph,
A.
B.
Dick
Company,
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
machine
that
would cut a good stencil, and
sell for less than one hundred
dollars.
This was an aspersion on other typewriters, espe-
cially when
this company
tried
to
enter
the
regular
type-
writer
field.
The
machine
did
not
possess
quality,
and
although
cheap
it was
expensive
for
the owner
because
it did no better
stencil work than other machines, and was
not
equal
to
the
requirements
of
general
office
work.
Almost
all
machines
of
the
day
in
which
it was manu-
factured would
cut a
stencil
quite
as good as
the
Edison,
and
as
a
result
it was
soon
discontinued.
The
fact
that
they
tried
to
enter
the
regular
typewriter
field
served
to
encourage mimeograph
competition
by
typewriter
compa-
nies who were building machines
that would
cut
satisfac-
tory
stencil
copies.
The Underwood Typewriter Company brought out the
Underwood Revolving Duplicator with
a
full
line
of
sup-
plies
and
specially
prepared
stencil
paper
of
the
highest
quality.
This work
is so important that digression
is par-
donable—few typists understand how to cut a
stencil prop-
erly—they
are
too
apt
to
give
a
heavy,
hesitating blow
when a
quick,
snappy, even
stroke
is
required.

115
FOREIGN TYPEWRITERS
It
is
a
strange
fact
that
all
of
the
best
typewriters
that have been produced have been
built
in America, and
American
machines
find
a
better
market
in
Europe and
other
countries
than machines
built
elsewhere.
The
style
of
construction
of
foreign
machines
does
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
most
exacting
users.
They are
all
visible
writers,
of course,
of the front stroke
principle,
but
they
seem
to
lack
the
refinement?
of
the
American made
machine.
As
this book
is intended
solely
to record
the
steps
in
the evolution of the typewriter, the whole foreign product,
of which the great majority
is manufactured
in Germany,
may
be
treated
under
one
head.
There
is
no
foreign
machine entitled to recognition in this book as a step in the
development
of
typewriters, and
they
are given
consider-
ation
only
as
a matter
of
historical
reference,
as
well
as
to
confirm
the
front
stroke
visible
principle
introduced
by
the
Underwood,
which
brought
about
the
revolution
in
the
style
of
typewriter
construction,
and
their
imper-
fections
only
serve
to
emphasize
the
superiority
of
the
American typewriters.
This statement
is confirmed by the
fact that an
edict
was
issued
by
the
German
Government
prohibiting
any
branch
of
the
Government
from
purchasing
typewriters
that were not made
in Germany.
This was necessary be-
cause the German product was lacking
in quality and was
not appreciated.
CONTINENTAL—The
Continental
typewriter
is
a
German
product, and
is
perhaps
one
of
the most promi-
nent foreign
built machines, but
it
is crude
in comparison

116
with the highly developed American machines.
It contains
absolutely no
feature
that
is commendable by comparison
with
the machines
already mentioned
in
this
book.
IDEAL—The
Ideal,
it
is
said,
is an American inven-
tion,
but
if
this
be
true,
it
only
proves
the
facts
before
stated
with
reference
to
the
superiority
of
the American
typewriters.
It
is made
in Germany,
for
the reason
that
it
could not
find
a market
in
the United
States.
KANZLER—The Kanzler
is manufactured
in
Berlin.
This machine has eight characters arranged on each
type-
bar.
However, the keyboard would seem to be larger than
the
regular
standard
keyboard.
The
machine
has
never
made
any
impression
either
in
its own
country
or
else-
where.
STOEWER—The Stoewer
is also a German machine,
and
other
writers
say
that
it
''more
strongly
resembles
the Underwood than any
other."
It
is
true
that
all ma-
chines
have
tried
to
"resemble
the Underwood,"
but
the
Stoewer machine has
fallen very short
in
its
effort.
This
machine was placed upon the English market as the Swift,
and while few changes were made they were
all more
in
imitation of the Underwood than the Stoewer
proper.
TORPEDO—The Torpedo, another German machine,
has
undergone
several
changes
in
its
formation
since
it
was
first
introduced.
This machine
is
also
built
in
imi-
tation
of
the Underwood,
although
it
has
a
right-hand
reverse
located
very
awkwardly.
Nevertheless,
it
con-
firms the basic front stroke visible principle.
MERCEDES—The
Mercedes
typewriter
is
another
German product, but
it differs
so
little from the machines
already
mentioned
that
it
is
really
quite
unnecessary
to
make any comment concerning
it.
Of
course,
it employs
the
front
stroke
principle,
as
all machines
built today
do.
A
feature
is
claimed
for
this
machine
which
is
an
old
neglected
idea
first used on
the Daugherty,
that
of
inter-

117
changing
the
type
by
loosening
a
few
screws,
and
re-
moving the entire typebar mechanism and
substituting an-
other.
This
is
impractical,
however,
because
the
change
of
type
is
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
the
ex-
pense and trouble.
TRIUMPH—The Triumph, another German machine,
is
quite on
a par with
those already mentioned,
although
to speak frankly, as
is the aim of
this book,
it
is doubtless
the best one of the entire German product.
None of these
machines
contains a
single
feature
that
has
not
already
been
incorporated
in
some
one
of
the
many
American
machines,
but
they have
copied
in
a
crude manner more
closely
the
Underwood
ideas,
evidently
recognizing
its
superior
principle
of
construction.
Cuts
of
the
foregoing
typewriters
would
convey
no
information,
as
they
all
have
the same
general
appear-
ance
and
differ
in
no
essential
features
from
the
cuts
shown
of
the
American
made
machines.
However,
the
reader's
attention
is directed
to
the diagrams
of
the
type-
bars in the back of the book, which show how closely they
have tried to imitate the Underwood typebar action.
MASKELYNE—During the long personal experience
of
the author
in
the
actual
sale of
the
typewriter, he has
been asked many times why manufacturers did not provide
a means
for
differential
spacing;
that
is,
the
regulation
of
the space between
the
characters.
As
typewriters
are
built today,
it requires as much space for the
"i,"
"1," and
other
letters
of
similar width
as
it does
for
the "m" and
"w," and where a wide type character
is doubled or comes
together,
followed
or
preceded
by
a
narrow
faced
type,
the spacing seems
quite
irregular.
This
principle
in
type-
writer
construction has not been
overlooked.
Various
at-

118
tempts have
been made
to
secure
this
feature,
as manu-
facturers recognize that the work would have a better ap-
pearance
if
spacing
could
be made
to
suit
the
individual
character
without
sacrificing
other
and
more
important
advantages.
The
most
worthy
effort
in
this
direction
was
that
made by
the manufacturers
of
the Maskelyne
typewriter.
It
provided
for
different
spacings,
one
for
a
character
similar
to "i;" another
for "e" and similar width; another
for V and
"\v;"and
still another
for
diphthongs.
This
construction necessarily affected the touch of the keys, and
the
action
of
the
carriage.
In careful writing, with
a
desire
to favor
this feature
of
the
machine,
the
work
was
satisfactory,
but
in
fast
writing
the mechanism
that
produced
this
result
became
negligible
or
inoperative, and
as
the disadvantage was
far
greater than
the advantage, which
consisted
chiefly
in
the
appearance
of
the work,
the
idea was abandoned and
the
manufacture
of
the machine discontinued.

119
TABULATORS
The
typewriter,
for
typewriting
in
its
simplest
form,
having been thoroughly established, inventors were making
every
effort
possible
to improve
the machine and
develop
its
practicability.
For
example:
The
earlier
typewriters
were
not
practical
for
doing
statement
or
form work;
it
was necessary to
strike the space bar for each
intervening
space
between
various
positions
of
writing
on
the
same
line,
then
lift the carriage and compare
scales.
This was
very
necessary, and work
of
this
character
could
not
be
done with any degree
of
facility and
accuracy.
Many attempts of various kinds and classes were made
to
produce
a
tabulating
device
that
would
be
practical,
but among the many only two are
entitled
to
recognition,
all
others embodying practically the same
principle. These
are the Gathright and Gorin, the latter being an infringement
on the former.
GATHRIGHT—On
January
15,
1889,
Joseph
B.
Gathright,
of
Louisville,
Kentucky,
filed
application
and
secured patent (No. 436916), September 23, 1890, for a tabu-
lating device.
The use of this invention permitted the car-
riage to move forward from one position to any other desired
position, skipping the regular spacing controlled by the rack,
and indicated by the scale on the machine.
This
device made
it
possible
to do
billing and
other
statement or form work
easily and accurately b\ mechan-
ically
skipping spaces
desired
to be
left
blank.
This was
accomplished
by
touching
a
key
that
released
the
dogs
from
the
rack and
permitted
the
carriage
to
pass
to
a
fixed
position,
where
its
course was
arrested
by
a
stop.
The number of columns was limited only by the number of
engaging
stops.

120
For
reasons
unknown,
this
patent
was
not
used
by
any
of
the
typewriters
manufactured
at
that
time.
Its
value, however, was immediately appreciated by
those
re-
sponsible
for
the
development
of
the
Underwood,
who
secured
control
of
the
Gathright
patents
and
embodied
them
in
the
construction
of
the
earliest Underwood ma-
chines.
This
invention
increased
the
value
of
the
type-
writer
inestimably
as
it was
the
initial
step
to
the many
uses
in
which
the
typewriter
has
been
employed
in
the
various forms of billing, bookkeeping, statement work,
etc.
GORIN—On
January
3,
1895,
F.
P.
Gorin,
of
Chicago,
Illinois,
filed
application
for a
patent on
a
tabu-
lating device, which was awarded him May
5,
1896,
(No.
559449).
This patent was assigned to the Remington Type-
writer Company and the device sold as an attachment to their
machine at a price of twenty dollars each above the
list price
of the machine.
The Underwood typewriter, which was
first produced
in
practical
form
about
the
year
1896,
entered
suit
for
infringement upon the Gathright patents, and after several
years
of
litigation,
established
through
the
courts
their
claim of priority as sole owners of
this device.
It
will
therefore
be
understood
that
all
mechanical
spacing devices
that permit
the carriage
to move forward
any number of spaces
in excess of the single regular
scale
space, used by
all machines, whether
they be
called
tabu-
lators, column
selectors,
self-starters,
or any
other name,
embody
the
principle
contained
in
the
Gathright
patents,
which belonged to, and was a part
of, the
first Underwood.

121
TYPEBARS
In
the
anatomy
of
the
typewriter
the
typebar
con-
struction
is
the
heart, and
its
action
the
pulse
or power
that
vitalizes
the
entire
machine.
The
power
is
trans-
mitted through the touch of the finger key to the typebar,
which makes
the impression on the paper, and causes
the
escapement
or
forward
movement
of
the
carriage.
To
illustrate: By
removing
a
typebar from
the Underwood,
then touching the
finger key
to which
it was
attached,
it
will
be
found
that
the machine
will
not
respond
in any
particular.
This
is true with the Underwood only, as
it
is
the only machine from which a typebar can be removed and
replaced without loosening a screw or the necessity
of
re-
adjusting
the
alignment.
Each
typebar
is numbered
and
made to
fit its position in the segment, and
it fits
it.
Geometry
teaches
that
a
straight
line
is
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points.
The
two
points
in
type-
writing are the touch and
the
impression—the
cause and
the errect—the action and the result.
It necessarily follows
that the best
results accrue from the most
direct "straight
line"
action.
This
is
accomplished by
the
elimination
of
parts and the reduction of
frictional points.
For
the
benefit
of
the
reader
diagrams
have
been
prepared
showing
the
construction
of
the
typebar
com-
bination of the most prominent typewriters in use
in recent
years, from which he can draw
his own
conclusions with
reference
to
the
merit
of
the
principle
and
construction.
These diagrams will be found commencing on page 133.
While
the typebar has been termed
the "heart
of
the
typewriter,"
there
are
other
very
important
features
that
must perform their proper functions in order that the best re-

122
suits may accrue.
It
is not the work performed by any indi-
vidual
part,
but
the
close
direct
co-operation
of
the many
parts that contributes to the best results in typewriting.
It would be impossible to definitely describe the differ-
ence in the typebars as shown in these diagrams.
It will be
observed, however, that the Underwood, the first one shown,
has but three active parts—the finger key lever, the connect-
ing link, and the typebar proper.
The principle embodied in
this construction not only contributes
to the greatest speed,
accuracy, and
durability,
but
conserves
the energy
of
the
typist.
It is the quickest typebar, not only because of the fact
that each individual finger key can be adjusted to suit the re-
quirements of each individual finger of each individual typist,
but because,
at the instant the typebar reaches the printing
point where the impression is made,
it comes in direct contact
with the universal bar, and the reaction of the latter causes
the immediate return of
the typebar.
This,
too,
is supple-
mented by
the bevel on
the
rigid dog. which
prevents
the
slightest hesitancy in the reaction of the universal bar, which
in turn acts directly upon the typebar.
The accelerated lever-
age for which provision
is made by the cam in the heel of the
typebar,
in which the connecting
link works,
increases
the
momentum of the typebar as
it approaches the printing point,
as shown on diagram, page 133.
The correct touch of an expert typist
is a quick, sharp,
snappy blow, releasing the key before the typebar reaches the
printing point.
This not only relieves the hand of the jar, but
it gives the machine a chance to do
its work properly.
The
carriage cannot go forward until the key
is released.
As a concrete example:
The winners
of the World's
Championship Trophy
have
not
always
struck more
keys
than
contestants
using other
machines,
but
the
simplicity,
direct action, elimination of friction and lost motion, both in
the typebars and escapement
of the machines
used by the

123
winners, have reduced the number of their errors to a mini-
mum.
Hence,
it will be seen that
it
is necessary to have a
machine
that
will respond
to every
effort
of
the
typist
in
order
to produce the best
results, not only
in winning the
championship, but
in
all things
for which the typewriter
is
used.
These facts will be appreciated by a careful study and
comparison of the diagrams of the typebars and escapements
in the back of the book.
It will be observed that many of the foreign machines
have not hesitated to imitate the style of construction of the
Underwood typebar even more than some
of the domestic
machines, but the lack of harmony
in the operation of the
numerous other active parts renders these machines even less
effective.
Hence,
it will be seen that the "heart" of the type-
writer, though most important,
is not the only
vital organ
necessary to the life and activity of the machine.
In
the evolution of the typewriter inventors have
de-
signed machines, which manufacturers have
built
/ with the
typebars
striking
the
printing
point
from
all
directions.
From
the
present
style
of
construction,
however,
it
will
be
noted
that
the
front
stroke
principle
has been
almost
universally adopted by
all the leading machines.
The type-
bars
lie
in
front and
strike upward,
a
style
first
success-
fully used by the Underwood.

124
UNIVERSAL BARS
The
universal
bar
is
that
part
of
the
machine upon
which
the power,
resulting from
the
stroke
of
the
finger
key,
actuates
the
escapement,
that
permits
the
forward
movement
of
the
carriage.
There are three means or methods by which
the
uni-
versal bar
is operated.
First, by direct action
of the type-
bar, without
division
of power, through
the
stroke
of
the
finger key
to the typewritten impression
as shown by dia-
gram, page
145.
The second method
is by
the
action
of
the
connecting
link
against
the
universal
bar,
the power
resulting from
the
stroke
of
the
finger key being
divided
at
that
point
of
contact; one
force operating
the
typebar,
the other
the escapement
; hence
a
division
of time
in
the
action
of
these two
important
parts
is
not
unusual.
See
diagram, page
146.
The third and
last
style
is
the action
of
the
finger
key
lever
on
the
universal
bar.
This
re-
moves
the
power
or
cause
farther
from
the
effect,
and
often
results
in
"skipping"
or
"piling."
See
diagram,
page
146.
By the
last two methods
it
is
possible
for
the
impression to be made without the escapement taking place
and
vice
versa.
Study
and
compare
these
diagrams
as
well as
all diagrams relating to the typebars and
links.
LINKS
The finger key lever receives the blow and the typebar
makes
the
impression,
but
there
is
a
connection
between
the finger key lever and the typebar,
called the
link.
The
number of parts
in
this link-connection varies from one
to
many,
as
is
shown
by
diagrams
of
four
machines
on
pages 147 and 148.

125
It
has
been
wisely
said,
and
the
theory
universally
accepted,
that "A
chain
is
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
link."
Through these
links the touch or cause which pro-
duces
the
effect
or
impression
is
transmitted.
The more
parts
in
the
link connecting
the
finger key
lever and
the
typebar,
the more
the construction
is complicated and
the
number of frictional points increased.
This indirect action
necessarily causes a loss of time and power.
It
will be observed
that
the Underwood has but one
part or
link connecting the finger key lever with the type-
bar, and
as
the typebar comes
in
direct
contact
with
the
universal bar
it more
fully
complies
with
the geometrical
definition
of
a
"straight
line"
than
any
other
typewriter
built.
If
you
are
interested
in
typewriter
construction
study
these diagrams
closely.
KEYBOARDS
Today the arrangement of the twenty-six small
letters
of
the
alphabet
on
the
keyboards
of
all
typewriters
is
practically
universal,
but
the remaining
characters, which
are more than
two-thirds,
are arranged
in
three
different
forms.
More than ninety per
cent,
of
all machines manu-
factured have a keyboard with a
single
shift
for
capitals,
or rather a
shift key on each side of the keyboard, which
may
be
operated
with
either
hand,
both
performing
the
same function.
The advent of touch typewriting has dem-
onstrated
that
this
is
the
best
style
of
keyboard.
It
is
simple,
compact,
and
complete.
Machines
equipped
with
this keyboard are universally used
in the classrooms of
all
high grade
schools,
the only exception being where a
stu-
dent
desires
to
be
prepared
for
a
certain
position where
another
style
of keyboard
is
used.
See diagram
of
uni-
versal keyboard, page
149.
The
double
keyboard
has
a
character
for
each
key.
This
style
is
not
popular
with
touch
typists,
from
the

126
fact that
it
is necessary to change the position of the hand
when
a
capital
is
desired.
Besides,
thirty-three and
one-
third per cent, of
all the keys, including the numerals, are
operated with
the
little
finger,
as shown by
figures 4 on
diagram page 149.
The
third
style
of keyboard has
three
characters on
each
key, which
requires
a
double
shift;
one
for
capitals
and the other for numerals, punctuation marks, and special
characters.
This keyboard
is
so arranged
not because
of
any advantage
it gives the typist, but for the benefit of the
manufacturer, which enables him
to accommodate the keys
to the limit of the typebar capacity as a
result of the
style
of construction of the machine.
(See page
150.)
The diagrams
of keyboards given
in
this book show
numbers above each key.
This number indicates the finger
used on
that
key, and
it
refers
to both
hands.
Number
one
indicates
the
first
finger
of
either
hand, number two
the
second
finger,
number
three
the
third,
and
number
four
the
little
finger.
The
space
bar
is
operated by
the
right thumb.
In
the
course
of
the
evolution
of
the
typewriter
the
keyboard
itself has undergone many changes.
All kinds of
freak ideas have been advanced, one of which
will be seen
in diagram, page
150.
As long as opinions difTer, and cer-
tain
styles of typewriter construction are continued,
it
will
be impossible
to adopt a keyboard that
will be uniform
in
all
respects.
Besides,
the
frequent
occurrence
of
certain
characters
in
other
languages
than
English
necessitates
certain changes
in order
to produce the best results.
The Universal Keyboard, as indicated
in the
first dia-
gram,
will doubtless remain unchanged, not only from the
fact
that
millions
of
typists
use
it and would
object
to
a
change, but
all
publications
for
the
instruction
of the
stu-
dent of typewriting are based upon
this
style of keyboard,
which
a change would materially
affect.

127
SPECIAL MACHINES
The story of the evolution of the typewriter, so far as
it
relates
to correspondence and
general
office work,
has
been
told.
But when the value of the typewriter as a gen-
eral
office assistant became fully appreciated by typists and
business men, they began
to cooperate with manufacturers
to enlarge the scope of
its usefulness.
Inventors responded
to
this universal desire
for the further development of the
typewriter,
until today there
is a machine
built
for every
purpose
for which
the pen was formerly
used,
except
the
actual
signature,
which
individualizes and
establishes
re-
sponsibility
for
the
work.
For example: The Underwood provides a machine for
general
accounting,
such
as
ledger
posting and
statement
work,
railroad
waybilling,
statistical
and
form
work
of
all
kinds.
In
fact,
it might
truly be
said
that
the
great
future of the typewriter industry
lies
in
this direction.
BOOKKEEPING
MACHINE—The
bookkeeping
machine enables
the operator
to make and prove
daily
all
records
in
bookkeeping and
statement
work,
keeping
the
UNDERWOOD BOOKKEEPING MACHINE

128
ledger
and
statement
of
accounts
automatically
balanced
to
the
minute.
This
eliminates
the
troubles common
in
taking off the
trial balance.
ADDENDAGRAPH—The
Addendagraph
is
practi-
cally
unlimited
in
its
capacity
for
statistical
work.
Any
ADDENDAGRAPH
number of columns may be made to the
full capacity of the
form used.
This machine
will give the
total
of each
col-
umn
vertically;
of
each
line
in
all
columns
horizontally;
and
will give a grand
total which
results
in
the proof of
the correctness
of
the work.
Other
manufacturers
have
likewise
appreciated
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
business
world
for
using
the
machine
in
a
broader
capacity
than
its
original
purpose,
and they too are building machines
in various forms in an
effort
to meet
this
desire.
AUTOMATIC
WRITER—The
Underwood
also
builds
an
Automatic
typewriter
for
circular
work.
This
machine
will
write
an
unlimited number
of
copies
from

129
the
original,
each
having
a
different name
and
address.
This original
is prepared on a Master Model machine, and
is
a
perforated
continuous
roll
of
paper,
similar
to
the
pianola
record.
The
perforated
roll
containing
the body
UNDERWOOD AUTOMATIC WRITER
of
the
letter,
together with
a
similar
roll with
the names
and
addresses,
are
inserted
in
the
machine,
a
supply
of
paper placed
in a receptacle
for the purpose, and the
elec-
tric
current turned
on.
The machine
will
continue
oper-
ation
until
the supply
of
paper, which can be renewed
as
often
as
desired,
is
exhausted.
Another advantage
is
the
fact
that
the
perforated
roll
or
copy may
be
taken
out,
changes made, and preserved
for
future
use.
During
the
last
four
decades
the
typewriter
has
evolved from an experimental, doubtful degree of progress
into
an
intensive
industry,
the
magnitude
of
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
over-estimate.
The
invested
capital
necessary to conduct the manufacturing end involves many
millions
of
dollars—a
multitude
of
the
most
expert
me-
chanics
are engaged
in
the
experimental
department,
en-
deavoring
to
further improve
the
typewriter—many
thou-

130
sands are employed
in
the actual manufacture
of
the ma-
chine—while
there
are armies
of men
all over
the world
employed
in
the
sales and
distribution
of the typewriter
nor does
this include
the
vast number
of employes
in
the
various
offices
required
to keep
the
accounts and conduct
the general
office
affairs
of
the
industry.
The
typewriter
has also contributed greatly
to the world's welfare by pro-
viding employment
for
hosts
of
typists,
principally young
women, who have not only made themselves self-supporting
and independent, but have gained a higher and truer
esti-
mate
of
their worth.
The
Franklin
Institute
of
the
State
of
Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia,
says: "The writing machine has become
in-
dispensable
to our
business
life."
The Shorthand Writer, edited by W. L. James, a man
with an extensive knowledge
of the
service the typewriter
renders,
says: "Thomas A.
Edison, no doubt
the greatest
inventor
of
all
time, never
invented anything more
useful
than
the
typewriter."
J.
N.
Kimball,
Manager
of
the
International
Type-
writing
Contests,
says: "And now one
last word.
I
said
a
little
while ago
that
the
thought
of
Shole? had moved
the
world
as much
as
it
could
have
been moved by
the
lever
of Archimedes, and
I
believe
that
is
a
correct
state-
ment.
Suppose,
for
instance,
that
all
the
results
of
that
first
thought
were
banished,
instantly,
from
the
world,
what
would
be
the
result?
It
is
something
worth
pon-
dering
upon,
is
it
not?
In
the
first
place,
and
as
the
most immediate
disaster, thousands upon thousands would
be deprived
of
a
livelihood, people who know
of no other
method by which
they
could make
a
decent
living.
The
wheels of trade would
stop with
a
suddenness
that would
be appalling, and no panic
that the world ever saw would,
equal, in pecuniary loss, the result of the withdrawal of the
typewriter from commercial
houses."

131
It
would
be
presuming
upon
the
intelligence
of
the
reader, and mistaking the requirements of the business world
to say that any one typewriter possessed all of the many ex-
cellent features known to the typewriter industry.
It
is, how
ever, an indisputable fact that the United States
is the great
leader
in
the manufacture
of
typewriters, and
the
foreign
made machines are practically imitations of the domestic pro-
duct.
As evidence of
this
fact, from
191
1
to
1915
inclusive,
the United States exported $47,950,951
in typewriters, and
in
191 6, $9,104,189.
There were no imports.
The Underwood typewriter
is the only writing machine
that has been
able
to
place
the
million
(1,000,000)
serial
number on
its
product, which
strongly
indicates
its popu-
larity.
