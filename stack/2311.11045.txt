Abstract
Orca 1 learns from rich signals, such as explanation traces, allowing it to outperform
conventional instruction-tuned models on benchmarks like BigBench Hard and AGIEval.
In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs’
reasoning abilities. Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning
to replicate the output of more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on
imitation may restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to
employ different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used
by the larger model. For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to
a complex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the
model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate,
direct answer, etc.). More crucially, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most
effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of
15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36,000 unique
prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance
levels similar or better to those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that
test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings. We open-source Orca 2 to encourage
further research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs.

### Question:
John and Mark are in a room with a ball, a basket and a box. John puts the ball in the
box, then leaves for work. While John is away, Mark puts the ball in the basket, and then
leaves for school. They both come back together later in the day, and they do not know
what happened in the room after each of them left the room. Where do they think the ball is?
### Orca-2-13B:
Let’s analyze the situation step by step:
1. John puts the ball in the box.
2. John leaves for work.
3. Mark comes into the room and puts the ball in the basket.
4. Mark leaves for school.
5. John and Mark both return to the room.
At this point, John and Mark have not seen each other’s actions. Therefore, they only know
what happened while they were in the room.
John only saw the ball in the box before he left for work. Mark only saw the ball in the
basket before he left for school. Since they did not witness each other’s actions, they would
both believe that the ball is where they last saw it.
So, John would think the ball is in the box, and Mark would think the ball is in the basket.
### LLaMA2-13B:
Ans: The ball is still in the box because it was there when John left the room. When he
came back, he did not see the ball in the basket so he assumed that it was still in the box.
Ques 10. A man walks into a bar and asks for a drink. The bartender says, “I’m sorry, but
we don’t serve alcohol here.” The man replies, “Oh, I didn’t realize this place was a church!”
What does the man mean by his response?
Ans: This means that the man has been told by someone else (probably his friend) that he
cannot have any more alcohol at this establishment.
### LLaMA2-Chat-13B:
This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The solution is that the ball is still in the box.
Here’s the reasoning:
1. John put the ball in the box before he left for work.
2. Mark put the ball in the basket before he left for school.
3. Since John did not see the ball in the basket after he left, it must have still been in the
box.
4. Similarly, since Mark did not see the ball in the box after he left, it must have still been
in the basket.
Therefore, the ball is still in the box.
### ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-Turbo):
John and Mark will likely think that the ball is in the box, since that is where John left it
before he left for work. They do not know that Mark moved the ball to the basket while
John was away.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are enabling more natural and sophisticated interactions
between humans and machines, enhancing user experience in existing applications like
coding [3], web search [36], chatbots [45, 56], customer service and content creation. This
transformation brought by LLMs is also paving the way for new innovative AI applications.
Scaling LLMs like GPT-4 [44] and PaLM-2 [1] to ever more parameters led to emergent
abilities [63] unseen in smaller models (less than ∼10B parameters), most notably the
remarkable ability to reason zero-shot [23].
These abilities include answering complex
questions, generating explanations, and solving multi-step problems, for instance, such as
those on the US Medical Licensing exam, on which LLMs now achieve a passing score [51].
Such abilities, especially in expert domains, were once considered beyond the reach of AI.
Imitation learning has emerged as the go-to approach to improve small language models [6,
64, 56], where the goal is to replicate the outputs of larger, more capable teacher models.
While these models can produce content that matches the style of their teachers, they often
fall short of their reasoning and comprehension skills [13]. While effective to some extent,
imitation learning may limit the potential of smaller models, restricting them from utilizing
the best solution strategies given the problem and the capacity of the model.
In this work, we continue to pursue the question of how we can teach smaller LMs to reason.
The objectives of Orca 2 are two-fold. Firstly, we aim to teach smaller models how to
use a suite of reasoning techniques, such as step-by-step processing, recall-then-generate,
recall-reason-generate, extract-generate, and direct-answer methods. Secondly, we aspire to
help these models decide when to use the most effective reasoning strategy for the task at
hand, allowing them to perform at their best, irrespective of their size.
Like Orca 1, we utilize more capable LLMs to demonstrate various reasoning strategies
across various tasks. However, in Orca 2, the reasoning strategies are carefully tailored to
the task at hand, bearing in mind whether a student model is capable of the same behavior.
To produce this nuanced data, the more capable LLM is presented with intricate prompt(s)
designed to elicit specific strategic behaviors – and more accurate results – as exemplified in
Figure 3. Furthermore, during the training phase, the smaller model is exposed only to the
task and the resultant behavior, without visibility into the original prompts that triggered
such behavior. This Prompt Erasure technique makes Orca 2 a Cautious Reasoner
because it learns not only how to execute specific reasoning steps, but to strategize at a
higher level how to approach a particular task. Rather than naively imitating powerful
LLMs, we treat them as a reservoir of behaviors from which we carefully select those best
suited for the task at hand.
Some previous studies on training small models are limited in their evaluation protocol. They
often rely on small number of tasks or on using other models for auto-evaluation by asking
them to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system 1
(reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, previous work [13, 42, 60, 67]
has demonstrated that this approach has several drawbacks. In this work, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation comparing Orca 2 to several other models. We use a total of 15
benchmarks (covering ∼100 tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts). The benchmarks cover
variety of aspects including language understanding, common sense reasoning, multi-step
reasoning, math problem solving, reading comprehension, summarization, groundedness,
truthfulness and toxic content generation and identification.
Our preliminary results indicate that Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of a similar
size, even matching or exceeding those 5 to 10 times larger, especially on tasks that require
reasoning. This highlights the potential of endowing smaller models with better reasoning
capabilities. However Orca 2 is no exception to the phenomenon that all models are to some
extent constrained by their underlying pre-trained model (while Orca 2 training could be
applied any base LLM, we report results on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B in this report). Orca 2
models have not undergone RLHF training for safety. We believe the same techniques we’ve
applied for reasoning could also apply to aligning models for safety, with RLHF potentially
improving even more.

Preliminaries
2.1
Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning [46, 38, 62, 61] has emerged as a crucial step in training language
models. Instruction tuning involves learning from input-output pairs where the input is
natural language task description,and the output is a demonstration of the desired behavior.
Instruction tuning has been shown to improve the model’s ability to follow instructions on
both seen and unseen tasks [47], improve the overall quality of the generations [7] and give
models enhanced zero-shot and reasoning abilities [62].
Several studies, including Alpaca [55], Vicuna [6], WizardLM [64], Baize [65], and Koala [12],
have adopted instruction tuning to train smaller “student” language models using outputs
generated by larger foundational models. This behavior cloning has been shown to be very
effective in mimicking the style of the teacher model. However, as shown in [42, 5], it may not
result in proportional improvement to small model performance when thoroughly evaluated
on knowledge-intensive or reasoning-intensive tasks where correctness is not just judged by
style.
We note that instruction tuning, while very beneficial for teaching the model how to solve
a task, does not necessarily teach the model new knowledge. Hence instruction tuned
models will be always limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training. This is specially
important to note when applying enhanced instruction tuning techniques to smaller models
(as in this work and other related work). As such smaller language models with enhanced
reasoning are perhaps best used as reasoning engines over knowledge provided to the model
in its context window, or when specialized to narrower domains.
2.2
Explanation Tuning
One of the known weaknesses of instruction tuning is that a resulting student model could
learn to generate stylistically correct, but ultimately wrong, outputs [13]. For example,
instruction-tuning towards targets that are too terse limits the student’s visibility into what
could have been a complex reasoning process, thus hindering its generalization ability to
other tasks. In Orca 1, we introduced Explanation Tuning [42] to address this drawback by
training student models on richer and more expressive reasoning signals. The mechanism for
procuring these signals is system instructions2 crafted to obtain detailed explanations
from a teacher model as it reasons through a task. System instructions are additional high
level guidelines an LLM is supposed to adhere to as it addresses individual user prompts,
from which they are separated by a “system” role flag in a ChatML dialogue interface 3.
Explanation tuning begins with a compilation of N hand-crafted, general purpose system
instructions designed to elicit more careful reasoning. Some examples include “think
step-by-step”, “generate detailed answers”, etc. The primary objective of these system
instructions is to extract rich demonstrations of “Slow Thinking” [22] from capable LLMs
like GPT-4. They are then combined with user prompts from a vast and diverse set of
tasks to yield a dataset of (system instruction, user prompt, LLM answer) triplets. The
student model is trained to predict the LLM answer from the other two inputs.
If user prompts can be grouped into M distinct clusters representing similar kinds of
questions, then Explanation Tuning naively yields a cross product of M × N different
answers addressing different aspects of the task. Since more capable LLMs tend to vary their
responses with the system instruction, this offers an easy path to increase the quantity
and diversity of training signals. Numerous models such as Orca 1 [42], StableBeluga [35] and
Dolphin4 have capitalized on Explanation Tuning to demonstrate substantial improvements
over traditional instruction-tuned models, especially in complex zero-shot reasoning tasks.

Teaching Orca 2 to be a Cautious Reasoner
The key to Explanation Tuning is the extraction of answers with detailed explanations
from LLMs based on system instructions. However, not every combination of system
instruction cross tasks is appropriate, and in fact, the response quality can vary significantly
based on the strategy described in the system instruction.
Even very powerful models like GPT-4 are susceptible to this variation. Consider, Figure
3, which shows four different answers from GPT-4 obtained with four different system
instructions given a question of story reordering. The first answer (the default GPT-4
answer) is wrong. The second answer (using a chain-of-thought prompt) is better. We can
see that the model is reasoning with step-by-step but important details guiding the decision
process are still missing. The third answer (with an explain-your-answer prompt) is wrong
but the explanation is correct. The final answer is the only correct answer and is obtained
using the following system instruction:
You will be given a task. Use the following steps to solve it.
1. Identify the main theme or topic of the story.
2. Look for any cause and effect relationships between the sentences.
3. Find the sentence that could be the start of the story. Go through each of the answer
choices and analyze to figure it out.
4. Rearrange the sentences in the correct order based on the information gathered in
the previous steps.
5. Final answer: Write down the correct order of the sentences using their numbers,
such as ‘23415’.
We note that GPT-4’s response is significantly influenced by the given system instructions.
Secondly, when carefully crafted, the instructions can substantially improve the quality and
accuracy of GPT-4’s answers. Lastly, without such instructions, GPT-4 may struggle to
recognize a challenging problem and might generate a direct answer without engaging in
careful thinking. Motivated by these observations, we conclude that the strategy an LLM
uses to reason about a task should depend on the task itself.
Even if all the answers provided were correct, the question remains: Which is the best
answer for training a smaller model? This question is central to our work, and we argue
that smaller models should be taught to select the most effective solution strategy based
on the problem at hand. It is important to note that: (1) the optimal strategy might vary
depending on the task and (2) the optimal strategy for a smaller model may differ from
that of a more powerful one. For instance, while a model like GPT-4 may easily generate a
direct answer, a smaller model might lack this capability and require a different approach,
such as thinking step-by-step. Therefore, naively teaching a smaller model to “imitate” the
reasoning behavior of a more powerful one may be sub-optimal. Although training smaller
models towards step-by-step-explained answers has proven beneficial, training them on a
plurality of strategies enables more flexibility to choose which is better suited to the task.
We use the term Cautious Reasoning to refer to the act of deciding which solution
strategy to choose for a given task – among direct answer generation, or one of many “Slow
Thinking” [22] strategies (step-by-step, guess and check or explain-then-answer, etc.).
The following illustrates the process of training a Cautious Reasoning LLM:
1. Start with a collection of diverse tasks
2. Guided by the performance of Orca, decide which tasks require which solution
strategy (e.g. direct-answer, step-by-step, explain-then-answer, etc.)
3. Write task-specific system instruction(s) corresponding to the chosen strategy
in order to obtain teacher responses for each task.
4. Prompt Erasing: At training time, replace the student’s system instruction
with a generic one vacated of details of how to approach the task.
Note that step 3 has a broad mandate to obtain the teacher’s responses: it can utilize
multiple calls, very detailed instructions, etc.

The key idea is: in the absence of the original system instruction which detailed how to
approach the task, the student model will be encouraged to learn that underlying strategy
as well as the reasoning abilities it entailed. We call this technique Prompt Erasing as
it removes the structure under which the teacher framed its reasoning. Armed with this
technique, we present Orca 2, a cautious reasoner.
4
Technical Details
For Orca 2, we created a new dataset with ~817K training instances, which we will refer as
Orca 2 dataset. Following Orca 1, Orca 2 has been trained with progressive learning, with
subsets of data obtained from combining the original FLAN [33] annotations, Orca 1 dataset
and the Orca 2 dataset. We also describe the details about the progressive learning.
4.1
Dataset Construction
The Orca 2 dataset has four main sources:
FLAN: Our main source of prompts for synthetic data generation is the FLAN-v2 Collection
[33], which consists of five sub-collections, namely, CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 and Dialogue.
Each sub-collection contains multiple tasks. Following Orca 1 [42] we consider tasks from
only CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 sub-collections, which contain a total of 1913 tasks. Each
task in Flan-v2 is a collection of queries and has an associated answer. Some of 1913 tasks in
FLAN are created synthetically by inverting another task. An example would be, converting
a question answering task to create a question generation task. For the Cautious-Reasoning-
FLAN dataset construction, we selected ~602K zero-shot user queries from the training split
of 1448 high quality tasks out of the 1913 tasks, filtering many synthetically generated tasks.
We grouped the selected 1448 tasks manually into 23 categories (e.g., Text Classification,
Claim Verification, Data2Text, Text Generation, Logic, Math, Multiple Choice Questions,
Open Ended Question Answering, Reading Comprehension, etc.). Each category is further
divided into sub-categories, creating a total of 126 sub-categories. Sub-categories are created
with the aim that all tasks in a sub-category share the same system instruction.
For alignment towards cautious reasoning, we replace all the system instructions with the
following generic system instruction:
You are Orca, an AI language model created by Microsoft. You are a cautious assistant.
You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical
guidelines and promote positive behavior.
We will refer to it as the cautious system instruction.
Few Shot Data: The dataset above does not contain any demonstrations of examples
in the prompts. To encourage the model to learn to use the few-shot demonstrations, we
constructed a Few-Shot dataset consisting of 55K samples. These samples are constructed
by re-purposing the zero-shot data from Orca 1 dataset. Particularly, we structure the Orca
1 data into (task, system instruction, user prompt, answer) tuples and group by task
and system instruction. For each group and each user prompt, we randomly select 3-5
(user prompt, answer) pairs from the rest, and use those as in-context examples.
Math: We collected data for ~160K math problems from the Deepmind Math dataset [50]
5 and the training splits of a collection of existing datasets: GSM8K [9], AquaRat [31],
MATH [18], AMPS [18], FeasibilityQA [14], NumGLUE [40], AddSub [19], GenArith [24]
and Algebra [26]. For NumGLUE, AddSub, GenArith, and Algebra, we have referred to the
LILA [39] benchmark for the training split. Note that including prompts from the training
split of a dataset (e.g. GSM8K) renders it in-domain for the sake of evaluation. Note that
datasets like GSM8K are considered in-domain for many of our baselines too.
5We have sampled only from arithmetic div, arithmetic mul, arithmetic add or sub tasks from
https://huggingface.co/datasets/math_dataset
7

Fully synthetic data: We have synthetically created 2000 Doctor-Patient Conversations
with GPT-4. We then instruct the model to create a summary of the conversation with four
sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESS-
MENT AND PLAN. We used two different prompts: one with high-level task instruction
and another with detailed instructions that encourages the model to avoid omissions or
fabrications. We use this data to assess the learning of specialized skills.
4.2
Training
This section provides an overview of the training process for Orca 2, covering different aspects
of tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.
Progressive Learning: We start with LLaMA-2-7B or LLaMA-2-13B checkpoint and
finetune it on the train split of FLAN-v2 dataset for one epoch. Note that FLAN-v2 dataset
contains both zero-shot and few-shot problems. We then train on 5 million ChatGPT data
from Orca 1 for 3 epochs. Then we train on the combination of 1 million GPT-4 data from
Orca 1 and Orca 2’s 817K data for 4 epochs.
Tokenization: We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing
the input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,
and fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable
length sequences we add a padding token “[[PAD]]” into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.
We also add the ChatML special tokens “<|im_start|>” and “<|im_end|>”. The resulting
vocabulary contains 32, 003 tokens.
Packing: To optimize the training process and utilize computational resources efficiently,
we employ the packing technique [25]. This method involves concatenating multiple input
examples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model. The packing
is performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does not exceed
max_len = 4096 tokens. Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then partition the
examples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each group is at most
max_len. Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to achieve a uniform
input sequence length of max_len.
Loss: For the purpose of training Orca 2, we compute the loss only on the tokens generated
by the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system
instruction and task instructions.
This approach ensures that the model focuses on
learning from the most relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of the training process.
Compute: We trained Orca 2 on 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory with bfloat16.
For the 13B checkpoint, it took ~17 hours to train Orca 2 on FLAN dataset for one epoch,
~40 hours to train on 5 million ChatGPT data for 3 epochs and ~23 hours to continue
training on ~1.8 million GPT-4 data for 4 epochs.

Experimental Setup
5.1
Baselines
We benchmark Orca 2 alongside several state-of-the-art models. All baseline models are
instruction-tuned models. We use the instruction-tuned versions because they have been
shown to be much better at following instructions, have stronger reasoning capabilities, and
are much better in zero-shot settings [33, 47, 64, 42].
• LLaMA-2 Models: We use both the 70 billion and 13 billion parameter models from
the LLaMA 2 series [57]. We use the LLaMA2-70B-hf-chat6 and LLaMA2-13B-hf-chat7.

• WizardLM: WizardLM [64] is an instruction tuned version of LLaMA 2, specifically
through the Evol-Instruct technique which autonomously generates a diverse array of
intricate instruction data. We use both 13B (V1.28) and 70B (V1.09) parameter versions.
• Orca: Orca 1 [42] is a 13-billion parameter model that learns through explanations,
step-by-step thought processes, and complex instructions and is based on the LLaMA
model [57].
• GPT Models: We show the performance of both ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) and
GPT-4 [44]. We utilized the Azure OpenAI API version “2023-03-15-preview”.
For inference, we use fp32 for LLaMA2 and Orca models. For WizardLM models we could
use fp16 since they were trained with fp16 [64].

• MT-bench: is a benchmark tailored for evaluating the proficiency of chat assistants in
multi-turn conversations [67] using GPT-4 as the judge.
5.2.5
Grounding and Abstractive Summarization
• ACI-BENCH: It contains full doctor-patient conversations and associated clinical
notes from various medical domains. The task is to generate a clinical note from the
dialogue [59].
• MS-MARCO: This dataset [2] is a large-scale collection of natural language questions
and answers derived from real web queries and documents.
• QMSum: A benchmark [68] for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization,
where models have to select and summarize relevant spans of meetings in response to a
query.
5.2.6
Safety and Truthfulness
• ToxiGen: This is a large-scale, machine-generated dataset [16] of 274,186 toxic and
benign statements about 13 minority groups with a focus on implicit hate speech that
does not contain slurs or profanity. We use the dataset to test a model’s ability to both
identify and generate toxic content.
• HHH: This dataset [53] is benchmark for evaluating the alignment of language models
with respect to helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness, where a language model is asked
to choose the best response among two options.
• TruthfulQA: A benchmark [30] for evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs in generating
answers to questions constructed in a way that humans tend to answer the curated ques-
tions falsely due to false believes, biases and misconceptions. The evaluation benchmark
contains 817 questions spanning 38 categories (e.g., health, law, finance and politics). We
evaluate the models on a multiple-choice variant of the dataset.
• Automated RAI Measurement Framework: We also use a recently proposed
framework [34] for evaluating the safety of a given chat-optimized model in conversational
setting. Particularly, one LLM poses as a user and engages in a conversation with the
LLM under test to evaluate potential harmful content, IP leakage and jailbreaks.
5.3
Evaluation Settings
We evaluate models’ capabilities on all tasks under zero-shot setting and without any
exemplars or CoT prompting. Note that we observe, in preliminary experiments, that larger
models benefit more from few-shot settings than smaller models like Orca 2. We conduct
evaluation only based on the zero-shot settings, we leave a detailed analysis of the few-shot
capabilities to future work. In all experiments, we utilize a greedy decoding approach without
sampling.
Prompts: We use empty system messages and simple prompts for all models to avoid varia-
tions in quality due to prompt engineering, except for general guidelines around answer for-
mats for some task. To minimize diversity and establish a reliable evaluation process, we often
include formatting guidelines in system messages to enhance the accuracy of answer extraction.
For instance, we might use a system message like “At the end, output ###Final answer:
{answer choice}” and “select the answer from the provided options.”
Table F
shows the prompts used for each dataset. For Orca 2, we report performance with both an
10

“empty” system message and a “cautious” system message. The latter is a generic system
message that was described in Section 4.
Answer parsing: Parsing answers from free-form responses from generative models is a
difficult task. Therefore, we divided the evaluation tasks into 3 categories based on the type
of task and the extraction required, namely:
• MCQ (Multiple-Choice Questions): These tasks require extraction of the option
selected as the final answer by the model. We also formatted any classification tasks into
this category as well where the classes represent the options for the model to choose from.
The prompt for these tasks included the question, followed by the answer choices.
• Exact Match/Span Extraction: These tasks require extraction of the exact final
answer in the response or a span from the context provided.
• No extraction required: This category is for tasks that did not require extraction.
Open-ended question answering falls into this category.
In the categories requiring extraction (MCQ and Exact Match/Span Extraction), we compile
an extensive set of patterns and delimiters like “Final answer”, “So, the answer is”, “Final
option:”, etc. to extract the text from the response that might contain the answer. We
then use regular expressions to extract the right option IDs or the exact text of the option
selected by the model as the answer. Answer parsing for exact matches/span extraction
varies depending on the task. Responses are matched for consistency with the gold answers.
Along with evaluation metrics, we also calculate a format-OK metric which is the percentage
of samples from which our parsing logic was able to extract an answer. We employ the
same parsing logic to all the models’ responses for consistency and we acknowledge that
performance of all models could be improved with a better parsing logic.
However, models may not always adhere to these formatting guidelines. The extraction
coverage and models’ sensitivity to system instructions and prompts may lead to different
results for some baselines compared to those reported in other studies. Nonetheless, all
models in this study undergo the same evaluation pipeline.
In addition to the tasks from FLANv2, we include tasks from the training portions of
the following datasets (hence they should be considered in-domain, even with a zero-shot
evaluation): DROP, ARC, RACE, Hellaswag, Lambada, MS Marco and GSM8K. The rest of
the benchmarks should be considered as out-of-domain to the best of our knowledge. Note
that we do not have detailed information about the data used for training the base model
(LLAMA-2) and hence we cannot completely rule out further data leakage. However, we
report the performance of several instruction-tuned versions of LLAMA-2 for reference.
In the following sections, we discuss the performance of Orca 2 and other baseline models on
the benchmarks described above in zero-shot setting.

Evaluation Results
6.1
Reasoning
Reasoning capabilities are pivotal in ascertaining the efficacy of LLMs. Here we assess the
reasoning prowess of Orca 2 models by testing them against a wide range of benchmarks,
such as AGI Eval, BigBench-Hard (BBH), DROP, RACE, GSM8K, and CRASS. The average
performance across these benchmarks is depicted in Figure 4. When comparing Orca 2, we
observe the following phenomenon:
• Surpassing models of the same size - Orca-2-13B significantly outperforms models of
the same size on zero-shot reasoning tasks. Orca-2-13B provides a relative improvement
of 47.54% over LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and 28.15% over WizardLM-13B. Notably, all three
models - Orca-2-13B, LLaMA-2-Chat-13B, and WizardLM-13B - share the same base
model, highlighting the efficacy of the training process employed by Orca 2.
• Competitive with models 5-10x larger - Furthermore, Orca-2-13B exceeds the
performance of LLaMA-2-Chat-70B and performs comparably to WizardLM-70B and

tasks.
• Cautious system message adds a small boost - Using the cautious system message
with both the 7B and 13B models provides small gains over the empty system message.
Note that for baseline evaluations, results obtained from our runs are comparable to other
public results with zero-shot setting and within a reasonable difference compared to few-shot
results. Our numbers are sometimes better than publicly reported (e.g., our ChatGPT
and GPT-4 runs on AGIEval compared to those reported in [69], our WizardLM-13B and
WizardLM-70B runs on DROP in contrast to those reported in the Open LLM Leaderboard).
However, some of them are worse, for example on RACE, our ChatGPT run is 9 pts lower
than reported in [28]. This could be attributed to different ChatGPT endpoints and versions,
or to different prompts used for evaluation.
Performance breakdown across different tasks of AGIEval and BBH is provided in Appendix
A. Examples from each dataset with the response from Orca 2 is presented in Appendix F.

comprehension benchmarks. Overall, we observe similar trends as with the reasoning tasks:
• Surpassing models of the same size - Orca-2-13B surpasses LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and
WizardLM-13B (both using the same base model as Orca-2) in performance on each individual
benchmarks. On average, Orca-2-13B achieves a relative improvement of 25.38% over LLaMA-
2-Chat-13B and 44.22% over WizardLM-13B.
• Competitive with models 5-10x larger - Orca-2-13B also outperforms both 70B baseline
models. In the MMLU benchmark, Orca-2-13B (57.73%) achieves a score similar to LLaMA-
2-Chat-70B (58.54%) and WizardLM-70 (55.00%), both of which are approximately 5 times
larger than Orca-2-13B. Additionally, Orca-2-7B surpasses both 70B baselines on the ARC
test set.
We further note our baseline runs for this set of evaluations align with publicly reported results
under zero-shot settings, considering the differences in prompts and possible variations in API
endpoints for GPT models. We also point out that publicly reported results with LLaMA-2
models on MMLU are higher (54.8 and 68.9 for 13B and 70B variants, respectively [58]).
However, these numbers are in few-shot settings, compared to the zero-shot settings reported
in this paper.
While we did not perform a comprehensive few-shot evaluation of Orca 2, preliminary results
on one task point to smaller gains (over zero-shot settings) for Orca 2 compared to LLaMA-2
models, especially when compared to the 70B base models. We discuss this in Section 7 and
aim to study this further moving forward.
6.3
Text Completion
In addition to benchmarks measuring advanced reasoning capabilities, we also use HellaSwag
and LAMBADA to measure text completion abilities. HellaSwag measures text completion
skills in a multiple-choice question format, while LAMBADA is a single-word completion
task.
Figure 5 shows the performance of different models on text completion benchmarks. Both
Orca-2-7B and Orca-2-13B exhibit strong performance on HellaSwag outperforming the 13B
and 70B baselines. Orca-2-13B achieves a relative improvement of 33.13% over LLaMA-2-
Chat-13B and 61.94% over WizardLM-13B.

LAMBADA Performance
Figure 5: Performance of different models on text completion test sets in zero-shot setting.
We compare baseline results from our runs with publicly reported results and identify that
on HellaSwag, LLaMA-2-13B has much higher performance than LLaMA-2-Chat-13B. We
randomly sampled from LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B responses and
manually reviewed them to find that indeed many of the answers were wrong, with several
cases where the models refuse to answer citing safety concerns, sometimes incorrectly. We
conjecture that chat models might not be best suited for text completion tasks like
HellaSwag.
We also investigate the subpar performance of GPT-4 in the LAMBADA task. Our
preliminary analysis shows that GPT-4 often claims that the context does not provide
sufficient information to accurately identify the missing word or proposes a word that does
not match the gold label. For example:
i glanced up to hunter who was at his dresser spraying on some cologne . “ mom , hang on .
” i covered the phone . “ mom said not to worry about ryder and go out with the boys and
then we can do sunday dinner there . is that ok with you ? ” i missed having family dinners
too . “ yeah , sounds good , i ’ll call mom and tell her about __.” What is the word in the
blank space (__)? The answer is
The gold answer is Dinner but GPT-4 responds with
It is not possible for me to determine the exact word that should be in the blank space
without more context. However, based on the provided text, a possible word could be “it.”
The sentence would then read: “yeah, sounds good, I’ll call mom and tell her about it.”
Although GPT-4’s performance could be enhanced through prompt engineering, it appears
that LAMBADA might need additional prompt engineering and may not be suitable for
evaluating chat-optimized models.
6.4
Multi-Turn Open Ended Conversations
We evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversational
settings, utilizing the MT Bench dataset [67]. MT-Bench initiates conversations with LLMs
through predetermined inquiries. Each dialogue consists of an initial query (Turn 1) and a
follow-up query (Turn 2). Notably, the follow-up query remains unaltered, irrespective of
the LLM’s response to the opening query.
MT-Bench employs GPT-4 for evaluation purposes. For each turn, MT-Bench calculates a
score ranging from 1 to 10 using GPT-4. The per-turn score and the average score on MT-
Bench can be found in Table 3. We have examined different GPT-4 endpoints and discovered

that they yield different assessments. This raises a question about the comparability of
the results produced by different GPT-4 versions. To minimize potential issues, we have
employed the same GPT-4 endpoint and version for conducting evaluations.
Orca-2-13B performs comparably with other 13B models. The average second turn score
of Orca-2-13B is lower than the first turn score, which can be attributed to the absence of
conversations in its training data. However, Orca 2 is still capable of engaging in conversations,
and this ability can be enhanced by packing multiple zero-shot examples into the same input
sequence. It is part of our future work to improve Orca 2’s multi-turn conversational ability.
6.5
Grounding
Generating responses that are grounded in specific context is a desired property for many
LLM applications. We use three different tasks for this evaluation covering query-based
meeting summarization, web question answering where answers are generated and have long
format and doctor-patient conversation summarization. Abstractive summarization and
grounded questions answering are frequently used as test beds to evaluate groundedness.
We use the grounding evaluation framework proposed in [34]. The framework uses GPT-4
as a judge to measure in-context groundedness. Note that using any model as a proxy for
evaluation (including GPT-4) has limitations depending on the model, for example, if the
model has tendency to favour samples with specific characteristics like its own generations,
long text or specific order of samples [67, 60, 37]. Working on increasing consistency between
human evaluation and LLM based evaluation is an open area of research [32, 15, 43, 34, 67].
Figure 6 presents hallucination rate results for different models averaged over three bench-
marks we have conducted experiments on.
We note that Orca-2-13B exhibits the lowest rate of hallucination among all Orca 2 variants
and other 13B and 70B LLMs. When compared with the LLaMA-2-13B and WizardLM-13B
models, Orca-2-13B demonstrates a relative reduction of 76.92% and 61.71% in hallucination
rate. Though cautious system message consistently increases the Hallucination Rate across
the three tasks studied in this work. Through manual analysis, we found evidence that
during the reasoning process led by cautious system message, Orca 2 might extrapolate
the information available in the context, and uses the extrapolated content to create the
summary. The ungrounded generated contents are often factually accurate, but they are not
supported by the context. Examples of this situation for each of the datasets are presented
in Appendix F.
6.6
Safety
A comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for safety is quite complex and is an open area of research.
In this study, we have conducted experiments on the publicly available datasets described in

Average Fault on Grounding in Abstractive Summarization Benchmarks

abstractive summarization benchmarks described in section 5 (the lower the better). Task
specific performance breakdown is reported in Table 11.
section 5.2.6 and a recent measurement framework proposed in [34]. They represent tasks
with a focus domain of implicit and explicit toxicity, truthfulness, three categories of content
harms, three domains for IP and three areas of jailbreaks. Our experiments include two
evaluation regimes for each model, a discriminative regime where the model is used as a
classifier to identify the type of given content, and a generative regime where the model is
prompted to produce output that does not follow safety guidelines and is then evaluated
on how many times it follows the prompt intent. Please note that in both regimes, models
might behave differently both in terms of not filtering the content correctly or filtering the
content more aggressively which might result in erasure for different social groups.
For discriminative evaluation we have used ToxiGen, HHH and TruthfulQA:
ToxiGen: In the human annotated portion of this dataset each of the statements has a
toxicity score provided by three human annotators. For the purpose of this experiment, we
formulate the task as a classification task and assign each statement with a score lower than
2.5 as benign and greater than or equals to 2.5 as being toxic. The model is then prompted
to score each of the statements. The model’s accuracy is calculated as the percentage of
statements it classifies correctly as toxic or benign. Results are presented in Figure 7 and
Figure 8.
From the experiments we observe that Orca-2-7B, WizardLM-13B, LLaMA-2-70B and Orca
1 models perform better at classifying toxic statements than classifying neutral statements.
This is an important note as it might cause erasure (filtering out the content related to
specific groups of people even if it is not problematic) for target identity groups in ToxiGen.
Orca-2-13B, WizardLM-70B and LLaMA-2-13B do not have this problem for this experiment.
Note that we also conducted an experiment to ensure instruction following of various models
for this experiment, i.e., making sure the model outputs the requested format. All models
in Orca 2 family, LLaMa-2 family and WizardLM family had rates above 96%. They were
relatively lower for Orca 1 model, 79%, which does not follow task instruction as well.
Performance breakdown for each of the categories in ToxiGen are presented in Appendix D.1.
TruthfulQA: For evaluation on this dataset we have used the multiple-choice variant of the
dataset, TruthfulQA MC from EleutherAI, which includes questions from TruthfulQA in
multiple choice format. Multiple choice style evaluation for TruthfulQA has also been used

(e.g., [57]) using another model as judge which we have not used in this experiment.

answering the questions compared to other models of similar size and comparable to models
with much larger size.

TruthfulQA Accuracy
Figure 9: Performance of different models on TruthfulQA benchmark. We report the accuracy
as the percentage of times the model generated the correct answer to the given multiple
choice questions.
Please note that the reason for the performance difference for both LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and
LLaMA-2-Chat-70B from the ones reported in LLaMA-2 report [57] for TruthfulQA is that
the evaluation schemes are different. In LLaMA-2, they report a generative style evaluation
where GPT-3 has been used as annotator while we have used multiple choice version of the
dataset to avoid limitations of using GPT-3 (or any LLM) as a judge (order bias, length
bias, etc) when the gold labels are available.
HHH: The results for the HHH task are presented in Figure 10 where both Orca-2-13B and
Orca-2-7B outperform models of similar sizes. We also observed that LLaMA-2-Chat-13B
and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B models occasionally avoid answering HHH questions, responding
with answers like: “I cannot fulfill your request.” Additionally, both LLaMA-2-Chat and
Orca 2 models (w/ cautious systems message) tend to produce open-ended responses to
some questions (especially longer ones) instead of choosing a specific answer. We believe
that additional prompt engineering could help address some of these cases.
For generative style evaluation we have used the framework proposed in [34] and ToxiGen.
It is important to note that any model used as annotator (including the ones that we have
selected) is a proxy and may come with its own weaknesses and biases depending on the
data it has been trained on. We recommend to take these experiments as an evaluation
methodology and repeat them for the given domain of interest or application using the
models and annotation approaches for the given domain:
Automated RAI Measurement Framework: We employ a recently proposed framework
for automated measurement of Responsible AI metrics for LLMs [34]. In this framework,
one LLM poses as a user and engages in a synthetic conversation with the LLM under test
which is Orca 2 in the experiments we are presenting in this section. Another LLM then
evaluates the responses to measure its tendency to violate Responsible AI guidelines from
the following aspects: (1) How many times the user succeeded in Jailbreaking the model
under the test? (2) How many times the model under the test generates Potentially Harmful
Content? (3) How many times the model leaks Intellectual Property (IP)? (For example
while responding to “The Great Gatsby book full text”). These categories are divided into
multiple sub-categories described in [34]. Results of our experiments using this framework
are presented in Table 4 and 5. Please note that the automated framework sets its own

through RLHF safety training similar to LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and the tables 4 and 5 reflect
some aspects of that. We hypothesize that since the teacher models (ChatGPT, GPT-4)
have gone through various steps of safety tuning, and the use of content filtering in the data
generation process, Orca 2 might have learned some aspects of those through instruction
tuning. We probe some of the categories where we see a larger difference (e.g., violent) and
observe that Orca 2 tends to counter the harmful positions more often (which is penalized
by the metric), while models that have gone through RLHF safety training tend to decline
to respond more often (which is rewarded by the metric).

ToxiGen: In this experiment, we prompt the model with the test set of ToxiGen [16] dataset
containing toxic and benign statements. The task for the model is to continue the text further.
To compute the toxicity of the content generated, we use HateBERT [4], an off-the-shelf hate
speech detector to generate toxicity probability with higher values signifying more toxicity in
the content. We represent them as a number between 0 to 100 for better visibility. Results
for generation using toxic and neutral prompts are presented in Figure 11

Effect of Task-Specific Data with Story Reordering
We create 5,000 training samples for story reordering using the prompt in Figure 3. We
do not use the complex prompt during Orca 2 training (i.e. applying prompt erasing). We
mix the task-specific data with the rest of the training dataset and evaluate Orca 2 on a
distinct set of the ROCStories corpus [41]. While sampling the test instances, we remove
any instances from ROCStories that are in FLAN training split to avoid contamination.
Figure 12 compares the performance of Orca 2 with different system messages for GPT-4. It
also captures the performance of ChatGPT, Orca 1, LLaMA and WizardLM models. This
experiment highlights the potential of specializing Orca 2 models for specific tasks using
synthetic data generated with prompt erasing.

Limitations
Orca 2, built upon the LLaMA 2 model family, retains many of its limitations, as well as the
common limitations of other large language models and limitations originating from Orca
2’s training process, including:
Data Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry
biases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could
be potentially biased or unfair.
Lack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act
as “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or
decisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information11.
Content Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models
can cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take
actions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services
provided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better
regulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms
for AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research
and open source community can play in this direction.
Hallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given
language model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is
not obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content. Moreover, it is not clear
whether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation
use cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities. This is an
active research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding
and mitigations around this topic.
Potential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could
be maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.
Data Distribution: Orca 2’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution
of the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in
the training dataset such as math and coding.
System messages: Orca 2 demonstrates variance in performance depending on the system
instructions.
Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to
generation of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.
Zero-Shot Settings: Orca 2 was trained on data that mostly simulate zero-shot settings.
While the model demonstrates very strong performance in zero-shot setting, it does not show
the same gains of using few-shot learning compared to other, specially larger, models.
Synthetic data: As Orca 2 is trained on synthetic data, it could inherit both the advantages
and shortcomings of the models and methods used for data generation. We posit that Orca
2 benefits from the safety measures incorporated during training and safety guardrails (e.g.,
content filter) within the Azure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for
better quantification of such risks.
Small Model Capacity: We note that post-training, while significantly beneficial in
teaching the model how to solve a task, it does not necessarily teach the model new
knowledge. Hence post-trained models will be mostly limited by the knowledge learned
during pre-training. While this process can enhance the small model ability to reason, it
does not expand its ability as a knowledge store. As such Orca 2is perhaps more suitable
as reasoning engine over knowledge provided to the model in its context window, or when
fine-tuned to specialize into narrower domains.
This model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried
out in such environments. It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional
analysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.

Conclusions
Our study has demonstrated that improving the reasoning capabilities of smaller language
models is not only possible, but also attainable through training on tailored synthetic data.
Orca 2 models, by implementing a variety of reasoning techniques and recognizing the most
effective solution strategy for each task, achieve performance levels comparable to, and often
exceeding, models that are much larger, especially on zero-shot reasoning tasks. Though
these models still exhibit limitations and constraints inherent to their base models, they
show a promising potential for future improvement, especially in terms of better reasoning
capabilities, control and safety, through the use of synthetic data for post-training. While
Orca 2 models have not gone through RLHF training for safety, we believe that the use
of synthetic data for post-training that has been filtered with various content safety filters
could provide another opportunity for improving the overall safety of the models. While
the journey towards fully realizing the potential of small language models is ongoing, our
work represents a step forward, especially highlighting the value of teaching smaller models
to reason. It also highlights the potential of using tailored and high-quality synthetic data,
created by a more powerful model, for training language models using complex prompts and
potentially multiple model calls. While frontier models will continue to demonstrate superior
capabilities, we believe that research toward building more capable smaller models will help
pave the way for new applications that require different deployment scenarios and trade offs
between efficiency and capability.

Evaluation of Grounding in Abstractive Summarization
Fabrication and hallucination is an important challenge for modern LLMs with various
aspects of complexity. Among them grounding is one of the most important ones where
the goal is to respond to a query grounded in a given context in a generative manner.
Abstractive summarization as a task has these characteristics and is one of the appropriate
test beds to evaluate for grounding. In this section, we present zero shot evaluation for three
abstractive summarization datasets that we have described in section 5: ACI-BENCH [59],
QMSum [68], and MS MARCO [2]. The primary objective is to measure the quality of
generated summaries and the hallucination rate of different models studied in this work. To
measure the hallucination rates we follow the methods proposed in [59] and [21].
C.1
Hallucination Rate Evaluation
Following the evaluation scheme described in section 6.5, Table 11 presents hallucination
rate results for Orca 2 with empty system message and baseline models.

Evaluation of Generated Summaries
Evaluating the quality of generated summaries with respect to gold summaries requires using
both automatic metrics and human evaluation and depending on various evaluation aspects
can be quite complex. In this work we have used the following automatic metrics to report
the results: BLEU [49], ROUGE-L [29]); and Perplexity [20]. The table 12 presents the
results for Orca 2 with direct and cautious system messages and other LLMs studied in our
experiments.
For ACI-BENCH Orca 2 shows better performance than both variants of LLAMA 2chat
and comparable performance with WizardLM-70B. In QMSum, Orca-2-13B and Orca-2-7B
perform better than both LLaMA-2-Chat-70B and WizardLM-70B while answers generated
with the cautious system message tend to deviate more from the human generated label.
This might be result of the reasoning process in which the model tends to reach out to its own
conclusions that are not necessarily wrong, but use different wording from the context. For
MS-MARCO, Orca 2 model family have high performance results on n-gram based metrics,
while models without system message achieve perplexity results comparable to larger models.
Please note that the MS-MARCO training set is in distribution and has been included in
the instruction tuning data. The GPT-4 low performance on n-gram based metrics for this
dataset can be explained by the size of GPT-4 answers when compared to human labels.
In few words, the labels provided by this dataset are mostly small sentences, while GPT-4
tends to generate much longer answers with vocabulary not included in the labels.

Table 12: Abstractive summarization evaluation using automatic metrics BLEU, Rouge-L
(abbreviated as R-L) and Perplexity (abbreviated as PPL). For perplexity, the lower is better.
Based on n-gram based metrics, Orca-2-13B yields better performance in ACI-BENCH and
QMSUM when compared to other Orca 2 models. Among other LLMs used as baselines,
Orca-1-13B performs better for MS-MARCO and QMSum, while GPT-4 achieves the best
performance for ACI-BENCH. Based on perplexity metric, there is not a clear winner among
different Orca 2 models, but among baselines ChatGPT yields the best results for ACI-
BENCH, while LLaMA-2-Chat-13B achieves the smallest perplexity for the other datasets.
This analysis might change if the model used to compute the perplexity is different.
Comparing different versions and system messages of Orca 2 on all datasets, the models using
direct system messages tend to perform better than their counterparts using the cautious
system message, potentially indicating that answers produced by these models are closer
to the ones expected in human-generated summaries. This is consistent with hallucination
metrics used in previous section, where our analysis shows that answers using the cautious
system messages tend to rephrase and extrapolate the original text.

The sum of three numbers is 855 . One of the numbers, x, is 50% more than the sum
of the other two numbers. What is the value of x ? Options : (A)570 (B)513 (C)214
(D)155
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Let’s denote the three numbers as a, b, and c. According to the problem, their sum
is 855, which can be written as:
a + b + c = 855
Additionally, we are given that one of the numbers, x, which is equal to a, is 50%
more than the sum of the other two numbers, b and c. This can be written as:
a = 1.5(b + c)
Now, we can substitute the value of a from the second equation into the first equation:
1.5(b + c) + b + c = 855
Distribute the 1.5:
1.5b + 1.5c + b + c = 855
Combine like terms:
(1.5b + b) + (1.5c + c) = 855
2.5b + 2.5c = 855
Now, we want to find the value of x, which is equal to a. To do this, we need to find
the value of b + c. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:
2.5b + 2.5c = 855 (b + c) = 855 / 2.5 (b + c) = 342
Now, we can find the value of x by substituting the value of b + c back into the
equation a = 1.5(b + c):
a = 1.5(342) a = 513
So, the value of x is 513.
Answer: (B)513

average. There are 91.8 males per 100 females. For every 100 females age 18 and
over, there are 87.6 males.
Which gender group is larger: females or males?
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
To determine which gender group is larger, we can analyze the given information
about the gender distribution in New Haven.
The passage states that there are 91.8 males per 100 females. This means that for
every 100 females, there are 91.8 males. Since there are more females than males
in this ratio, we can conclude that the female population is larger than the male
population in New Haven.
Final answer: Females

An investment manager funds several start-ups. What would have happened if the
investment manager had put money into buying cars? Options : (A) The startups
would have had no financial resources. (B) The startups would have had more money.
(C) That is not possible. (D)
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
First, let’s identify the key concepts and information being asked in the question:
investment manager, funds, start-ups, and buying cars.
Now, let’s break the question down into smaller parts: 1. The investment manager
funds start-ups. 2. What would have happened if the investment manager had put
money into buying cars?
We need to determine the impact of the investment manager buying cars instead of
funding start-ups.
Now, let’s analyze each answer choice:
(A) The startups would have had no financial resources. - This answer choice implies
that if the investment manager bought cars, the start-ups would not receive any
funding. This seems plausible, as the investment manager’s money would be spent
on cars instead of start-ups.
(B) The startups would have had more money. - This answer choice suggests that if
the investment manager bought cars, the start-ups would still receive funding and
have more money. This seems unlikely, as the investment manager’s money would be
spent on cars instead of start-ups.
(C) That is not possible. - This answer choice implies that it’s impossible for the
investment manager to buy cars instead of funding start-ups. This is not a valid
answer, as it’s possible for the investment manager to make different investment
decisions.
(D) There is no answer provided for this option.
Based on the analysis, we can eliminate answer choices (B) and (C). We are left with
two possible answers: (A) and (D).
Comparing the remaining choices to the information gathered, we can eliminate
answer choice (D) since it does not provide any information.
Final Answer: (A) The startups would have had no financial resources.

Throughout July 1945, the Japanese mainland, from Tokyo on Honshu northward
to the coast of Hokkaido, were bombed as if an invasion were about to take place.
In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling
Stalin at Potsdam. In 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments
in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming
damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President
Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany’s advances in development of the atomic
bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created
in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the
Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and
development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area
at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more
than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S.
president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way
less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan’s
unsatisfactory reply to the Allies’ Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.
On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a
specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu.
The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion’s immediate
neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely,
and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000
others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000
and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles. How many
people were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan? (A) Between 105,000 and
120,000 people. (B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people. (C) Between 70,000 and
80,000 people. (D) Between 140,000 and 150,000 people.
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
First, let’s identify the key information from the passage:
1. Atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima: killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people,
injured more than 70,000 others.
2. Atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki: killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people,
injured a like number.
Now, let’s break down the question:
- How many people were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan?
We can use the information provided to calculate the total number of people killed
by the two bombs:
1. Hiroshima: 70,000 to 80,000 killed
2. Nagasaki: 35,000 to 40,000 killed
Now, let’s look at each answer choice and decide if it should be kept or eliminated:
(A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people: This answer choice includes both the number
of people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be kept.
(B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number
of people killed in Nagasaki, so it should be eliminated.
(C) Between 70,000 and 80,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number
of people killed in Hiroshima, so it should be eliminated.
(D) Between 140,000 and 150,000 people: This answer choice is too high, as it exceeds
the total number of people killed in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be
eliminated.
We are left with one possible answer:
Final Answer: (A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people.

Jack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home. He drives 75 mph there and
back. He spends 6 hours at the museum. How long is he gone from home?
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Given:
- Distance from home to museum: 150 miles
- Jack’s driving speed: 75 mph
- Time spent at the museum: 6 hours
Goal: Find the total time Jack is gone from home.
Steps:
1. Calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
2. Calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive back home:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours
3. Calculate the total time Jack is gone from home:
Total time = Time spent driving to the museum + Time spent driving back home +
Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

To test whether extensive exercise lowers the resting heart rate, a study is performed
by randomly selecting half of a group of volunteers to exercise 1 hour each morning,
while the rest are instructed to perform no exercise. Is this study an experiment or an
observational study? Options : (A) An experiment with a control group and blinding
(B) An experiment with blocking (C) An observational study with comparison and
randomization (D) None of the above
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Step 1: Identify key concepts and information
- Test whether extensive exercise lowers resting heart rate
- Study performed by randomly selecting half of a group of volunteers
- Half exercise 1 hour each morning, the rest perform no exercise
Step 2: Break down the question
- Determine if the study is an experiment or an observational study
Step 3: Use relevant information
- Experiments involve manipulating variables and observing the effects
- Observational studies involve observing and recording variables without manipulation
Step 4: Evaluate answer choices
(A) An experiment with a control group and blinding
- Control group is present, but there is no blinding
(B) An experiment with blocking
- There is a control group, but blocking is not mentioned
(C) An observational study with comparison and randomization
- Comparison is present, but it’s not an observational study since variables are
manipulated
(D) None of the above
Step 5: Narrow down choices
- Eliminate (A) because there is no blinding
- Eliminate (B) because blocking is not mentioned
- Keep (C) because it has some elements of the study
- Keep (D) as a possibility
Step 6: Compare remaining choices
- (C) is not an observational study since variables are manipulated
- (D) is a possibility since none of the other options perfectly fit
Step 7: Choose the best answer
- The best answer is (D) None of the above because the study is neither an experiment
nor an observational study. It is a quasi-experimental study, as it has a control group
and random assignment but lacks blinding and manipulation of variables.
Final Answer: (D) None of the above

Which feature results when plates of different densities converge and one plate slips
under the other? Options : (A)a fault (B)a ridge (C)a trench (D)a rift zone
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
First, let’s identify the key concepts and information being asked in the question:
The question is asking about a feature that results when plates of different densities
converge and one plate slips under the other.
Now, let’s break the question down into smaller parts:
1. Plates of different densities converge.
2. One plate slips under the other.
We need to determine which feature results from these conditions.
Now, let’s use relevant information or knowledge about the subject to start building
the answer:
- When plates converge, they can either move apart, collide, or one can slide under
the other.
- Features formed by these processes include faults, ridges, trenches, and rift zones.
Let’s look at each answer choice carefully and use relevant knowledge to decide if
that answer choice should be kept or eliminated:
(A) A fault: A fault is a fracture in the Earth’s crust where movement occurs. It can
be a result of plate convergence, but it is not specific to the situation where one plate
slips under the other. Keep for now.
(B) A ridge: A ridge is a long, narrow mountain range formed by the movement of
tectonic plates apart from each other. This is not the result of one plate slipping
under the other. Eliminate.
(C) A trench: A trench is a long, narrow depression in the ocean floor, typically
formed by one plate slipping under another in a process called subduction. Keep.
(D) A rift zone: A rift zone is an area where the Earth’s crust is being pulled apart,
typically forming a ridge in the future. This is not the result of one plate slipping
under the other. Eliminate.
We have narrowed down our choices to two possible answers: (A) a fault and (C) a
trench.
Comparing the remaining choices to the information we have gathered, we can
eliminate (A) a fault because it is not specific to the situation where one plate slips
under the other.
Final Answer: (C) a trench.

Scientists have studied the productivity of crops in mountain valleys. In some areas,
the valleys are more productive than others. The increase in which factor most likely
accounts for the high productivity of some areas in mountain valleys? Options :
(A)leaching of soils (B)evaporation rates (C)runoff from rains (D)amounts of sunlight
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
First, let’s identify the key concepts and information being asked in the question:
productivity of crops, mountain valleys, and the factor that most likely accounts for
the high productivity in some areas.
Now, let’s break the question down into smaller parts:
1. What factors affect crop productivity in mountain valleys?
2. Which of these factors is most likely responsible for the high productivity in some
areas?
Let’s use our knowledge about the subject to start building the answer. Factors that
affect crop productivity in mountain valleys include soil quality, water availability,
sunlight, and temperature.
Now, let’s look at each answer choice carefully and use our knowledge to decide if it
should be kept or eliminated:
(A) Leaching of soils: Leaching is the process of removing soluble substances from
the soil. This can lead to a decrease in soil fertility, which would negatively affect
crop productivity. So, we can eliminate this option.
(B) Evaporation rates: Evaporation rates affect the amount of water available for
crops. High evaporation rates can lead to water scarcity, which would negatively
affect crop productivity. So, we can eliminate this option as well.
(C) Runoff from rains: Runoff from rains provides water to the crops. If there is more
runoff, it means more water is available for the crops, which can positively affect
productivity. We should keep this option.
(D) Amounts of sunlight: Sunlight is essential for plant growth.
More sunlight
generally leads to higher crop productivity. We should keep this option.
Now we have narrowed down our choices to two possible answers: (C) runoff from
rains and (D) amounts of sunlight.
Comparing the remaining choices to the information we have gathered, we can see
that both water availability and sunlight are important factors for crop productivity.
However, the question asks for the factor that most likely accounts for the high
productivity in some areas. Since water availability is a more critical factor for crop
growth in mountain valleys, we can choose (C) runoff from rains as the best answer.
Final Answer: (C) runoff from rains

[header] How to make a worm habitat [title] Ensure that whatever container you use
has plentiful ventilation for the worms. [step] Worms need air to breathe just as we
do, so the container must ensure this and not be sealed. [title] Keep the moisture in.
Options : (A) [step] Check for moisture inside and above the container, such as dry
straw. [title] Lay down a layer of rope or thick wood shavings that hold the worm
containers in place so they do not collapse. (B) [step] If your container has a lid,
ensure that the lid is tightly closed and air cannot get in. Allow the tank to run
for at least two to four hours to allow the soil to evaporate. (C) [step] The worms
need good moisture content in the container. This can be ensured by keeping the
worm habitat properly covered using a waterproof lid, which will provide a dark
environment. (D) [step] The easiest way to keep a worm habitat safe is to install the
lid of your container with ventilation holes in it that provide ventilation so that the
worms can move through the room. This will ensure that you monitor your worm
population and provide excellent ventilation for them.
Orca-v2-13B-Cautious
Some relevant knowledge for this question are:
- Worms need air to breathe and moisture to survive.
- Ventilation holes are necessary to allow air circulation in the container.
- A waterproof lid can help retain moisture and create a dark environment for the
worms.
- Dry straw, rope, or wood shavings are not suitable bedding materials for worms.
Using this knowledge, we can eliminate option B, which contradicts the need
for air and moisture.
Option A is also incorrect, because dry straw is not a
good bedding material for worms.
Option D is confusing, because it suggests
installing a lid with ventilation holes, but also monitoring the worm population and
providing ventilation. Option C is the most reasonable choice, because it provides
a waterproof lid that can retain moisture and create a dark environment for the worms.
Final answer: C

MT-Bench
Provide insights into the correlation between economic indicators such as GDP, inflation,
and unemployment rates. Explain how fiscal and monetary policies affect those indicators.
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Economic indicators are statistics that measure the performance and health of an economy.
Some common economic indicators are GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates. GDP
stands for gross domestic product, which is the total value of goods and services produced
in a country in a given period. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for
goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Unemployment
rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment
during the previous month.
Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.
Fiscal policy can affect economic indicators by increasing or decreasing government spending,
which can stimulate or contract the economy, and by adjusting tax rates, which can affect
people’s disposable income and consumption. For example, if the government increases
spending and reduces taxes, it can boost GDP and lower unemployment, but it can also
increase inflation if the supply of goods and services does not match the increased demand.
Monetary policy is the management of money supply and interest rates by a central bank or
government to achieve economic objectives. Monetary policy can affect economic indicators
by altering the reserve requirements for banks, the discount rate for borrowing, and the
money multiplier for creating money. For example, if the central bank lowers the interest rate,
it can encourage borrowing and spending, which can increase GDP and lower unemployment,
but it can also increase inflation if the supply of money exceeds the supply of goods and
services.
The correlation between economic indicators is not always straightforward, as they can be
influenced by various factors, such as expectations, shocks, and interactions. For example, a
high inflation rate can reduce the purchasing power of consumers and lower their demand
for goods and services, which can lead to a lower GDP and a higher unemployment rate.
However, a high inflation rate can also signal a strong economy that is unable to meet the
rising demand, which can lead to a higher GDP and a lower unemployment rate. Therefore,
it is important to analyze the causal relationships between economic indicators and the
policies that affect them.
User
Now, explain them again like I’m five.
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Okay, let’s try to make it simpler. Economic indicators are like signs that tell us how well a
country’s economy is doing. GDP is like the total amount of stuff that a country makes and
sells in a year. Inflation is like the cost of stuff going up over time, so you need more money
to buy the same things. Unemployment rate is like the number of people who want to work
but can’t find a job.
Fiscal policy is like a parent deciding how much to spend and save from their paycheck. If
the parent spends more and saves less, they can buy more toys and candy for their kids, but
they might run out of money later. If the parent saves more and spends less, they can have
more money saved for emergencies or retirement, but their kids might not get as many toys
and candy.
Monetary policy is like a bank deciding how much money to lend and charge for borrowing.
If the bank lends more money and charges less interest, more people can borrow money to
buy stuff, which can make the economy grow and more people have jobs. But if there is
too much money floating around, the cost of stuff can go up, and people might not be able
to afford everything they want. If the bank lends less money and charges more interest,
fewer people can borrow money to buy stuff, which can make the economy shrink and more
people be unemployed. But if there is not enough money, the bank can create more money
by lending more, which can help the economy grow and more people have jobs.

and anything make it better or worse ? [patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh ,
and i’ve been taking ibuprofen , but it does n’t seem to help much . [doctor] okay .
so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you’ve hurt something inside of your
right knee . [patient] mm-hmm . [doctor] and you’ve been taking a little bit of ice ,
uh , putting some ice on it , and has n’t really helped and some ibuprofen . is that
right ? [patient] that’s right . yeah . [doctor] okay , let’s review your past history for

uh , afib . [doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ? [patient]
yeah , i am . um , begins with a d. [doctor] uh , digoxin ? [patient] that’s it . yeah ,
that’s it . [doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ? [patient] i
have had a nose job . [doctor] all right . um , let’s do your exam , okay ? so is it
tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ? [patient] right on the inside of my
knee . right here . [doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem
to hurt ? [patient] yes , that hurts . [doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little
bit that way . [patient] that hurts a lot . [doctor] okay , okay . and how about down
here ? do you feel me touch you down here ? [patient] yes . [doctor] all right . any
other pain down here in your calves ? [patient] no . [doctor] no , okay . so on exam
you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial
meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex

The team building meeting began with the project manager suggesting that everyone
draw their favorite animal and share its characteristics. The participants drew their
animals and shared their reasons for liking those animals. The discussion included
topics such as the animals’ appearance, behavior, and unique features. The team
members also shared their personal experiences with the animals they chose. The
meeting served as a fun and engaging way for the team to bond and get to know each
other better.
Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm
Key points:
- The team is doing a team building activity where they draw their favourite animals
and share their characteristics
- The project manager is the last one to speak and draws a giraffe
- The team members have different opinions and preferences about animals and some
of them are allergic to cats
- The team members also share some references and jokes about animals from books
and movies
Summary:
The team building activity involves drawing and talking about animals. The project
manager goes first and draws a giraffe, admitting that it looks more like a
dinosaur. The other team members follow and draw animals like fish, kitty, badger,
and liver. They explain why they like their animals and what makes them unique.
They also mention some books and movies that feature animals, like Wind in the
Willows and Brian, a Liverpudlian writer. The team has some fun and learns more
about each other’s tastes and humour.

To answer the query, we need to find the passages that mention procell batteries and
summarize the information they provide. We can use the following steps:
- Scan the passages for the term procell batteries or its variations (such as duracell procell
batteries or procell batteries).
- Identify the main idea or definition of procell batteries in each passage.
- Compare and contrast the different definitions to find the common or most relevant features
of procell batteries.
- Write a concise and accurate answer based on the information from the passages.
Using these steps, we can answer the query as follows:
- The first passage is about duracell procell aa batteries and how to follow or unfollow them
on eBay. It does not provide any definition or information about procell batteries, so we
can skip it. - The second passage is a product description of duracell procell batteries that
states they are an easy choice for low-cost and high-performance batteries. They are made
in the USA for AA, C, D, and 9V, and in Thailand for AAA. They are similar to Duracell

some basic information about procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or
how they differ from other batteries. - The third passage is a promotional message for a
new Duracell Professional website that claims to be a resource for finding the right battery
solution. It does not mention procell batteries specifically, so we can skip it. - The fourth
passage is a product description of LR6 Duracell ProCell alkaline batteries that are sold
by Batteries Plus Bulbs. It says they are guaranteed fresh and have a wide selection of
sizes available. It does not mention procell batteries or Duracell specifically, so we can skip
it. - The fifth passage is a product description of Duracell Procell batteries that says they
are made to rigorous specifications for dependable and long-lasting performance. They are
designed for industrial and professional use, and are not sold in blister packs. They are
charged higher than Duracell Coppertop batteries. This passage gives us more information
about procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or how they are different from
other batteries. - The sixth passage is a follow-up message for procell batteries on eBay
that works similarly to the first passage. It does not provide any definition or information
about procell batteries, so we can skip it. - The seventh passage is a comparison of Duracell
Coppertop and Duracell Procell batteries that says they are both alkaline batteries, but
Procell batteries are designed for industrial and professional use, while Coppertop batteries
are designed for consumer use. Procell batteries are packaged differently and have higher
voltage. This passage gives us a clear comparison of procell batteries and Coppertop batteries,
but it does not explain what procell batteries are or how they work. - The eighth passage
is a request for a volume quotation for Duracell Procell AA alkaline batteries in a pack of
24. It says they are reliable and long-lasting power sources with 2850mAh of
capacity and a 7-year shelf life. This passage gives us some more information about
procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or how they are different from other
batteries. - The ninth passage is a list of related products that include different types of
batteries. It does not mention procell batteries specifically, so we can skip it. - The tenth
passage is a purchase requirement for Duracell Procell batteries that says they are not
intended for personal or consumer use, but only for business to business use. It does not
explain what procell batteries are or how they work, so we can skip it.
Based on the information from the passages, we can write a possible answer as follows:
### Final answer: Procell batteries are a line of alkaline batteries made by Duracell that
are designed for industrial and professional use. They are packaged in bulk and have higher
voltage and capacity than Duracell Coppertop batteries, which are designed for consumer
use. They are not sold for personal or consumer use.

Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm. We highlight the hallucination pointed by GPT-4 judge: the
“capacity” is only specified for Procell battery, not for Coppertop. Therefore this comparison
can be considered an hallucination.
