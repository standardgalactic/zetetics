Preface
Optoelectronics has become an important part of our lives. Wherever light is used
to transmit information, tiny semiconductor devices are needed to transfer elec-
trical current into optical signals and vice versa. Examples include light-emitting
diodes in radios and other appliances, photodetectors in elevator doors and digi-
tal cameras, and laser diodes that transmit phone calls through glass ﬁbers. Such
optoelectronic devices take advantage of sophisticated interactions between elec-
trons and light. Nanometer scale semiconductor structures are often at the heart
of modern optoelectronic devices. Their shrinking size and increasing complexity
make computer simulation an important tool for designing better devices that meet
ever-rising performance requirements. The current need to apply advanced design
software in optoelectronics follows the trend observed in the 1980s with simula-
tion software for silicon devices. Today, software for technology computer-aided
design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) represents a fundamen-
tal part of the silicon industry. In optoelectronics, advanced commercial device
software has emerged, and it is expected to play an increasingly important role in
the near future.
The target audience of this book is students, engineers, and researchers who
are interested in using high-end software tools to design and analyze semicon-
ductor optoelectronic devices. The ﬁrst part of the book provides fundamental
knowledge in semiconductor physics and in waveguide optics. Optoelectronics
combines electronics and photonics and the book addresses readers approaching
the ﬁeld from either side. The text is written at an introductory level, requiring
only a basic background in solid state physics and optics. Material properties and
corresponding mathematical models are covered for a wide selection of semi-
conductors used in optoelectronics. The second part of the book investigates
modern optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, edge-emitting
lasers, vertical-cavity lasers, electroabsorption modulators, and a novel combi-
nation of ampliﬁer and photodetector. InP-, GaAs-, and GaN-based devices are
analyzed. The calibration of model parameters using available measurements is
emphasized in order to obtain realistic results. These real-world simulation exam-
ples give new insight into device physics that is hard to gain without numerical
modeling. Most simulations in this book employ the commercial software suite
developed by Crosslight Software, Inc. (APSYS, LASTIP, PICS3D). Interested
readers can obtain a free trial version of this software including example input
ﬁles on the Internet at http://www.crosslight.com.

PREFACE
I would like to thank all my students in Germany, Sweden, Great Britain,
Taiwan, Canada, and the United States, for their interest in this ﬁeld and for all
their questions, which eventually motivated me to write this book. I am grateful
to Dr. Simon Li for creating the Crosslight software suite and for supporting my
work. Prof. John Bowers gave me the opportunity to participate in several leading
edge research projects, which provided some of the device examples in this book.
I am also thankful to Prof. Shuji Nakamura for valuable discussions on the nitride
devices. Parts of the manuscript have been reviewed by colleagues and friends, and
I would like to acknowledge helpful comments from Dr. Justin Hodiak, Dr. Monica
Hansen, Dr. Hans-Jürgen Wünsche, Daniel Lasaosa, Dr. Donato Pasquariello, and
Dr. Lisa Chieffo. I appreciate especially the extensive suggestions I received from
Dr. Hans Wenzel who carefully reviewed part I of the book.

Introduction to
Semiconductors
This chapter gives a brief introduction to semiconductors. Electrons and holes
are carriers of electrical current in semiconductors and they are separated by
an energy gap. Photons are the smallest energy packets of light waves and
their interaction with electrons is the key physical mechanism in optoelec-
tronic devices. The internal temperature of the semiconductor depends on the
energy of lattice vibrations, which can be divided into phonons. The Fermi
distribution function for the electron energy and the density of electron states
are introduced.
1.1
Electrons, Holes, Photons, and Phonons
Optoelectronics brings together optics and electronics within a single device, a sin-
gle material.The material of choice needs to allow for the manipulation of light, the
manipulation of electrical current, and their interaction. Metals are excellent elec-
trical conductors, but do not allow light to travel inside. Glass and related dielectric
materials can accommodate and guide light waves, like in optical ﬁbers, but they
areelectricalinsulators.Semiconductorsareinbetweenthesetwomaterialtypes,as
they can carry electrical current as well as light waves. Even better, semiconductors
can be designed to allow for the transformation of light into current and vice versa.
The conduction of electrical current is based on the ﬂow of electrons. Most
electrons are attached to single atoms and are not able to move freely. Only some
loosely bound electrons are released and become conduction electrons. The same
number of positively charged atoms (ions) is left behind; the net charge is zero.
The positive charges can also move, as valence electrons jump from atom to
atom. Thus, both valence electrons (holes) and conduction electrons are able to
carry electrical current. Both the carriers are separated by an energy gap; i.e.,
valence electrons need to receive at least the gap energy Eg to become conduction
electrons. In semiconductors, the gap energy is on the order of 1 eV. The energy
can be provided, e.g., by light having a wavelength of less than the gap wavelength
λg = hc

with the light velocity c and Planck’s constant h. In the wave picture, light is rep-
resented by periodic electromagnetic ﬁelds with the wavelength λ (see Chapter 4).
In the particle picture, light is represented by a stream of energy packets (photons)
with the energy
Eph = hc
λ = hν = ¯hω
(1.2)
(ν is frequency, ω = 2πν is angular frequency, and ¯h = h/2π is the reduced
Planck constant). The photon energy must be at least as large as the band gap Eg
to generate electron–hole pairs. Vice versa, conduction electrons can also release
energy in the form of light and become valence electrons. This energy exchange
between electrons and photons is the key physical mechanism in optoelectronic
devices.
From an atomic point of view, valence electrons belong to the outermost elec-
tron shell of the atom, which is fully occupied in the case of semiconductors; i.e.,
no more electrons with the same energy are allowed. As these atoms are joined
together in a semiconductor crystal, the electrons start to interact and the valence
energy levels separate slightly, forming a valence energy band (Fig. 1.1). Electrons
within this band can exchange places but no charge ﬂow is possible unless there
is a hole. To generate holes, some electrons must be excited into the next higher
energy band, the conduction band, which is initially empty. The concentration n
of electrons in the conduction band and the concentration p of holes in the valence
band control the electrical conductivity σ of semiconductors
σ = qnµn + qpµp
(1.3)
with the elementary charge q and the mobility µn and µp of holes and electrons,
respectively.

in a solid crystal (right).

1.2. FERMI DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY OF STATES

Without external energy supply, the internal temperature T of the semiconduc-
tor governs the concentrations n and p.The higher the temperature, the stronger the
vibration of the crystal lattice. According to the direction of the atom movement,
those vibrations or lattice waves can be classiﬁed as follows:
• longitudinal (L) waves with atom oscillation in the travel direction of the
lattice wave, and
• transversal (T) waves with atom oscillation normal to the travel direction.
According to the relative movement of neighbor atoms the lattice waves are
• acoustic (A) waves with neighbor atoms moving in the same direction, and
• optical (O) waves in ionic crystals with neighbor atoms moving in the
opposite direction.
The last type of vibrations interacts directly with light waves as the electric ﬁeld
moves ions with different charges in different directions (see Chapter 4). Phonons
represent the smallest energy portion of lattice vibrations, and they can be treated
like particles. According to the classiﬁcation above, four types of phonons are
considered: LA, TA, LO, and TO. Electrons and holes can change their energy by
generating or absorbing phonons.

Fermi Distribution and Density of States
The probability of ﬁnding an electron at an energy E is given by the Fermi
distribution function

(1.4)
with the Fermi energy EF and the Boltzmann constant kB(kBT ≈25 meV at room
temperature). At T = 0 K, the Fermi energy is the highest electron energy; i.e.,
it separates occupied from unoccupied energy levels. In pure semiconductors, EF
is typically somewhere in the middle of the band gap (Fig. 1.2). With increasing
temperature, more and more electrons are transferred from the valence to the
conduction band. The actual concentration of electrons and holes depends on the
density of electron states D(E) in both bands. Considering electrons and holes as
(quasi-) free particles, the density of states in the conduction and valence band,
respectively, becomes a parabolic function of the energy E (Fig. 1.2)

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO SEMICONDUCTORS
1.3
Doping
To boost the concentration of electrons or holes, impurity atoms are introduced
into the semiconductor crystal.As illustrated in Fig. 1.3, those dopants have energy
levels slightly above the valence band (acceptors) or slightly below the conduc-
tion band (donors). Acceptors receive an additional electron from the valence
band and become negatively charged ions, thereby generating a hole (p-doping).
Donors release an electron into the conduction band and become positively charged
ions (n-doping). Equation (1.14) is still valid in thermal equilibrium; however,
the minority carrier concentration is now much smaller than the concentration of
majority carriers. In other words, the Fermi level EF is close to the majority carrier
band edge (Fig. 1.4), and the Boltzmann approximation of Eqs. (1.9) and (1.10)
is not valid any more (degenerate semiconductor). In Fermi statistics, the general
expressions for the carrier concentrations are

can be recognized as the Fermi level approaches the band edge. For numerical

Typical dopant degeneracy numbers are gD = 2 and gA = 4 [9]. ED and EA

n-doping or p-doping versus dopant concentration, as calculated from Eq. (1.18)
for GaAs at room temperature. The Fermi level penetrates the conduction band
with high n-doping and low ionization energy (ED = Ec −0.01 eV).
Nonequilibrium carrier distributions can be generated, for instance, by exter-
nal carrier injection or by absorption of light. In such cases, electron and hole
concentrations may be well above the equilibrium level. Each carrier distribution
can still be characterized by Fermi functions, but with separate quasi-Fermi levels
EFn and EFp for electrons and holes, respectively (see Section 3.2).

Chapter 2
Electron Energy Bands
This is a brief survey of important terms and theories related to the energy
bands in semiconductors. First, the fundamental concepts of electron wave
vectors ⃗k, energy dispersion E(⃗k), and effective masses are introduced.
Section 2.2 is mathematically more involved as it outlines the ⃗k · ⃗p method,
which is most popular in optoelectronics for calculating the band structure.
Semiconductor alloys, interfaces of different semiconductor materials, and
quantum wells are covered at the end of this chapter.
2.1
Fundamentals
2.1.1
Electron Waves
In the classical picture, electrons are particles that follow Newton’s laws of
mechanics. They are characterized by their mass m0, their position ⃗r = (x, y, z),
and their velocity ⃗v. However, this intuitive picture is not sufﬁcient for describing
the behavior of electrons within solid crystals, where it is more appropriate to
consider electrons as waves. The wave–particle duality is one of the fundamental
features of quantum mechanics. Using complex numbers, the wave function for a
free electron can be written as
ψ(⃗k, ⃗r) ∝exp(i ⃗k⃗r) = cos(⃗k⃗r) + i sin(⃗k⃗r)
(2.1)
with the wave vector ⃗k = (kx, ky, kz). The wave vector is parallel to the electron
momentum ⃗p
⃗k = m0⃗v

(2.2)
and it relates to the electron energy E as

(2.3)
with k2 = k2

cribed by a parabola with the free electron mass m0 as parameter.

CHAPTER 2. ELECTRON ENERGY BANDS
Within semiconductors, an electron is exposed to the periodic lattice potential.
It no longer behaves like a free particle as its de Broglie wavelength 2π/k comes
close to the lattice constant a0. The ensuing Bragg reﬂections prohibit a further
acceleration of the electron, resulting in ﬁnite energy ranges for electrons, the
energy bands.
In general, electron wave functions need to satisfy the Schrödinger equation
¯h
2m0
∇2ψ −V (⃗r)ψ = Eψ,
(2.4)
where the potential V (⃗r) represents the periodic semiconductor crystal. This
equation is often written as
Hψ = Eψ
(2.5)
with H called the Hamiltonian. The Schrödinger equation is for just one electron;
all other electrons and atomic nuclei are included in the potential V (⃗r).1 For
the free electron, V (⃗r) = 0 and the solution to the Schrödinger equation is of
the simple form given by Eq. (2.1). Within semiconductors, the solutions to the
Schrödinger equation are so-called Bloch functions, which can be expressed as a
linear combination of waves
ψn(⃗k, ⃗r) = un(⃗k, ⃗r) exp(i⃗k⃗r),
(2.6)
with the electron band index n. These functions are plane waves with a
space-dependent amplitude factor un(⃗k, ⃗r) that shows lattice periodicity. A one-
dimensional schematic representation is given in Fig. 2.1 to indicate the relation-
ship between the lattice potential and the Bloch function.The probability of ﬁnding
an electron at the position ⃗r is proportional to |ψn(⃗r)|2.
In some practical cases, exact knowledge of the semiconductor Bloch func-
tions is not required; only the energy dispersion function E(⃗k) needs to be found.
Inserting Eq. (2.6) into Eq. (2.4), we obtain solutions only for certain ranges of
the electron energy En(⃗k), the energy bands, which are separated by energy gaps
(Fig. 2.2). A general feature of the solutions to the Schrödinger equation is the
periodicity of En(⃗k), given in Fig. 2.2a. This ﬁgure shows the periodicity in the kx
direction with a period length of kxa0 = 2π; a shift of the solution E(kx) by 2π/a0
in kx represents the same behavior.Any full segment of the periodic representation
is a reduced k-vector representation. It is shown for the range −π/a0 < kx < π/a0
in Fig. 2.2c. This k-range is called ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The same treatment applies
to the other two directions in the ⃗k space. Figure 2.3 illustrates the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone in two dimensions and it indicates several symmetry points. Besides the cen-
tral  point, the zone boundaries exhibit additional symmetry points. The X point

all denoted as the ⟨100⟩direction. The K point lies in the ⟨110⟩direction and the
L point in the ⟨111⟩direction. The electron band structure is fully described by
the three-dimensional dispersion functions En(⃗k) within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
An example is given in Fig. 2.4 for GaAs exhibiting the smallest band gap at the
 point.
The ⃗k-space concept is explained in much more detail in many solid-state
textbooks, e.g., in [12]. Brillouin zone properties like symmetry points depend on
the crystal type. GaAs and most other common materials in optoelectronics are
zinc-blende-type crystals (Fig. 2.5). Si and Ge form diamond-type crystals. Both
types exhibit a so-called face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice. Some materials
are able to form more than one crystal structure. For instance, GaN, AlN, and
InN may exist as zinc blende crystals but they are commonly grown as wurtzite
crystals, which exhibit a hexagonal Bravais lattice (cf. Fig. 2.10).
2.1.2
Effective Mass of Electrons and Holes
The properties of semiconductors are mainly determined by the behavior of elec-
trons near the smallest band gap, where the relationship En(⃗k) is almost parabolic

electron mass m0 is replaced by an effective electron mass
mn = ¯h2
d2En
dk2
−1
(2.7)
to represent the inﬂuence of the crystal lattice. The effective electron mass mn
is inverse proportional to the curvature d2En/dk2 of the energy dispersion.
If En(⃗k) is anisotropic, different effective masses need to be given for each crys-
tal direction (Table 2.1). The effective mass approximation allows for signiﬁcant
simpliﬁcations in semiconductor theory, and it is widely used in modeling opto-
electronic devices. Effective mass calculations are based on approximate solutions
to the Schrödinger equation. Examples are the tight binding, the orthogonalized
plane wave, the pseudopotential, the cellular, the augmented plane wave, and the
Green’s function methods. These methods differ in the assumptions made for the
crystal potential V and for the wave function ψ, and they are described in several
textbooks (see, e.g., [12]).
In optoelectronic devices, electron transitions near the smallest gap between
occupied (valence) and unoccupied (conduction) bands are of main interest. In

2.1. FUNDAMENTALS
19
typical optoelectronic materials based on, e.g., GaAs, InP, or GaN, this band gap
occurs at the  point (⃗k = 0). In atomic physics terminology, the electron states at
the bottom of the conduction band are s-like with zero orbital angular momentum
(isotropic in space). The states at the top of the valence band are p-like with
nonzero angular momentum and they are anisotropic (three independent states).
Their orbital angular momentum is ¯h, whereas the spin angular momentum is
¯h/2. Both momenta can point in different directions and add up to different total
momenta. The valence state notation often uses the total angular momentum and
its value in the z direction (in ¯h):

In cubic semiconductors, heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands usually
overlap at the  point (energy band degeneration). The spin–orbit (SO) split-off
valence band is separated by the split-off energy 0 and it is often less impor-
tant. Figure 2.6 illustrates the bands of interest. Besides the direct band gap at
the  point, additional conduction band minima may occur at other points in the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Figure 2.6 shows the case of an indirect semiconductor like Si
where the lowest band gap is correlated to an indirect electron transition involving
a change in momentum. However, most materials used in optoelectronics are direct
semiconductors having the smallest band gap at the  point. For those materials,
the most popular band-structure model is based on the ⃗k · ⃗p method, which is
outlined in the following sections.
Electron effective masses are given in Table 2.1. The minima of the L and
X conduction bands are typically anisotropic (ellipsoidal isoenergy surfaces) and
they are characterized by a longitudinal and a transversal effective mass. The
density-of-states (DOS) effective mass in Eq. (1.5) is then given by
mc = ν2/3
D (mlm2
t )1/3
(2.8)
with the degeneracy number νD of equivalent conduction band minima (νD = 6 for
Si; 4 for Ge; 3 for AlAs, AlSb, AlP). For example, the conduction band minimum
of Si lies at the X point, which occurs νD = 6 times in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
(cf. Fig. 2.3). The longitudinal mass ml = 1.916 m0 in the ⟨100⟩direction and
the transversal mass mt = 0.191 m0 for the two perpendicular directions was
obtained from low-temperature cyclotron resonance measurements [14], resulting
in the DOS mass mc = 1.064. Due to temperature effects, this value is slightly
lower than the room-temperature value mc = 1.18 given in Table 1.1.

(2.9)
The effective mass typically increases with higher carrier energy, as the band cur-
vature decreases, which makes the effective mass somewhat dependent on doping
and on temperature [7]. The anisotropy of the valence bands and dependence of
the hole effective masses on the crystal direction are discussed in Section 2.2.
2.1.3
Energy Band Gap
Energy gaps and related parameters are listed in Tables 1.1, 2.3, and 2.9 for zinc
blende crystals and in Table 2.7 for wurtzite nitrides. Band gap reductions with
higher temperature mainly arise from the change of the lattice constant. The fol-
lowing Varshni approximation [15] is often employed using empirical parameters

High carrier concentrations in conduction and valence bands lead to band
gap reduction (renormalization) due to enhanced carrier–carrier interaction [10].

Heavy doping also leads to band gap narrowing caused by carrier–carrier
interaction as well as by the distortion of the crystal lattice (band tailing). Both
band gap reduction mechanisms add up and they are often hard to separate.

Electronic Band Structure: The ⃗k · ⃗p Method
The most popular way to calculate the band structure E(k) near the  point is the
so-called ⃗k · ⃗p method. This model introduces the Bloch function (Eq. (2.6)) into
the single-electron Schrödinger equation, resulting in

un(⃗k, ⃗r) =

un(⃗k, ⃗r).
(2.14)
The momentum operator ⃗p stands for −i ¯h∇.The functions un(⃗k, ⃗r) are constructed
as linear expansions of the solutions un0 = un(0, ⃗r) at the  point
un(⃗k, ⃗r) =

anmum0(⃗r).
(2.15)

CHAPTER 2. ELECTRON ENERGY BANDS
Figure 2.7: Band gap reduction as calculated from Eq. (2.12) at room temperature.
For small ⃗k vectors near the  point, perturbation theory can be applied as outlined
in [20]. In ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, the expansion coefﬁcients anm are given
in terms of a single material parameter, the bulk momentum matrix element Mb
(cf. Section 5.1.1). This leads to Schrödinger matrix equations as large as twice
the number of bands, including the two possible elecron spin directions.
2.2.1
Two-Band Model (Zinc Blende)
The conduction band is commonly well separated from the valence bands and
treated as parabolic near the  point with the effective mass mc. Even the spin–
orbit split-off energy 0 is often considered large enough to ignore the SO band
(cf. Fig. 2.6). However, in GaAs- and InP-based materials, the other two valence
bands are very close and cannot be treated separately. The interaction between HH
and LH band leads to valence band mixing with nonparabolic dispersion functions
E(⃗k). Including the spin degeneracy, the two-band ⃗k · ⃗p model gives a 4 × 4
Hamiltonian matrix, which is shown below together with the corresponding basis
functions [21],

using the Kronecker symbol δij (δij = 1 for i = j, δij = 0 otherwise). Without
the nondiagonal elements in the Hamiltonian matrix Hij (Sk = Rk = 0), simple
parabolic dispersion functions E(⃗k) would result from Eq. (2.21) and the four
bands would be independent of each other. The nondiagonal elements Sk and Rk
lead to valence band mixing; i.e., each band’s structure En(⃗k) is affected by the
other bands. By changing the set of basis functions, the 4 × 4 Hamiltonian matrix
can be transformed into two 2 × 2 Hamiltonians and Eq. (2.21) can be solved
analytically [21]. This results in the energy dispersion functions

2.2.2
Strain Effects (Zinc Blende)
Strain deforms the crystal lattice. However, it is assumed to be still periodic
such that Bloch functions are still applicable. Since the elementary crystal cell is
deformed, potential and Bloch lattice functions us
n(⃗k, ⃗r) now have a period equal
to the strained elementary cell. The relative change of the lattice period gives the
strain
εij = ai
aj
,
(2.34)
which may be different in each direction (a, lattice constant; i, j = x, y, or z).
The fractional change in volume is given by
V
V
= εxx + εyy + εzz.
(2.35)
With small strain, the strained Hamiltonian can be given as perturbation of the
unstrained Hamiltonian H0 [22]:

H0 + Hε

us
n(⃗k, ⃗r) = En(⃗k)us
n(⃗k, ⃗r).
(2.36)
In the following, we consider the common case of biaxial strain, like in lat-
tice mismatched superlattices or quantum wells grown in the z direction, with

28
CHAPTER 2. ELECTRON ENERGY BANDS
εxx = εyy ̸= εzz and εij = 0 for i ̸= j. The two strain components are related by
the elastic stiffness constants C11 and C12 as
εzz = −2C12
C11
εxx with εxx = εyy = ast −a0
a0
,
(2.37)
where ast and a0 are the lattice constant of the strained and unstrained crystal,
respectively. For compressive strain, ast < a0, εxx = εyy < 0, and εzz > 0.
Additions Pε and Qε are required to the diagonal elements of the two-band
Hamiltonian matrix in Eq. (2.16) (Pk →Pk + Pε, Qk →Qk + Qε) with
Pε = −av(εxx + εyy + εzz)
(2.38)
Qε = −b
2(εxx + εyy −2εzz).
(2.39)
As a result of this modiﬁcation, the strain is found to cause the following shifts
of the band edges at the  point:
Ehh(0) = E0
hh = E0
v −Pε −Qε
(2.40)
Elh(0) = E0
lh = E0
v −Pε + Qε.
(2.41)
The conduction band edge is given by
Ec(0) = E0
c = E0
v + Eg + ac(εxx + εyy + εzz).
(2.42)
The factors ac and av are so-called hydrostatic deformation potentials; b is the
shear deformation potential (Table 2.6). The separation of the total hydrostatic
deformation potential in conduction (ac) and valence band (av) contributions is
important at heterointerfaces (see Section 2.5).
The energy dispersion becomes
Ehh(⃗k) = E0
v −Pk −Pε −sgn(Qε)

(Qk + Qε)2 + |Rk|2 + |Sk|2
(2.43)
Elh(⃗k) = E0
v −Pk −Pε + sgn(Qε)

(Qk + Qε)2 + |Rk|2 + |Sk|2.
(2.44)
The factor sgn(Qε) is negative for compressive strain (Qε < 0) and positive
for tensile strain (Qε > 0). Similar to Eq. (2.24), we obtain for the strained
case and ky = 0 [21]

Three- and Four-Band Models (Zinc Blende)
All of the above results for heavy- and ligh-hole bands have neglected their inter-
action with the spin–orbit band as well as with the conduction band. The inclusion
of such interactions is brieﬂy described in the following.

2.2. ELECTRONIC BAND STRUCTURE: THE ⃗k · ⃗p METHOD

The 6×6 ⃗k·⃗p model solves the Schrödinger equation for the six valence bands,
including spin degeneracy. In the Luttinger–Kohn model [24], the expansion of the
functions un(⃗k, ⃗r) also considers contributions from basis functions un0 of higher
bands. Including biaxial strain, the Hamiltonian matrix becomes for bulk material

which, for the light-hole band, is somewhat different from the 4 × 4 Hamiltonian
result in Eq. (2.41) due to the interaction with the SO band. The conduction band
edge is still given by Eq. (2.42). Analytical formulas for the band structure E(⃗k)

with the strain parameter s = Qε/0. Without strain, s = 0 and f+(0) = 1, the
effective masses for heavy and light holes are identical to those obtained from the
4 × 4 Hamiltonian.
An 8 × 8 Hamiltonian matrix emerges if the conduction band is also included
in the set of basis functions [26]. This four-band ⃗k · ⃗p model requires much algebra
and the interested reader is referred to the literature (see, e.g., [27] or [28]). In most
practical cases, conduction band and valence bands can be treated separately as
shown above. However, one important result relates the electron effective mass
mc to the bulk momentum matrix element Mb

which shall be further employed in Chap. 5. Fb is a correction parameter that
accounts for the inﬂuence of higher bands, which tend to make the effective mass
heavier. For example, the electron effective mass mc/m0 = 0.067 of GaAs is
reduced to 0.05 with Fb = 0. Both Mb and Fb are hardly temperature dependent
so that the temperature effect on mc mainly originates from the band gap Eg. The
momentum matrix element is often given in terms of the energy parameter Ep

Three-Band Model for Wurtzite Crystals
Due to the recent success with GaN-based optoelectronic devices, their wurtzite
(hexagonal) crystal system has gained much interest (cf. Chap. 9). The previ-
ous sections have outlined the ⃗k · ⃗p band-structure model for zinc blende (cubic)
crystals. Here, we apply the ⃗k · ⃗p method in a similar way to wurtzite crystals.
The wurtzite crystal structure is illustrated in Fig. 2.10. For wurtzite structures, all
three valence bands are strongly coupled and valence band mixing must be taken
into account. The three valence bands are referred to as heavy-hole (HH), light-
hole (LH), and crystal-ﬁeld split-hole (CH) band. Spin–orbit interaction leads to
a slight separation of all three band edges. Wurtzite band-structure parameters are
listed in Table 2.7. For GaN, cr is positive and E0
hh is the top valence band edge.

Quantum Wells
A quantum well — or any other variation of the semiconductor composition in
growth direction z — can be included in the Schrödinger equation by adding
an appropriate potential Vqw(z) to the periodic potential V (⃗r) of the crystal lat-
tice. Within the effective mass approximation, the wave function is given by
n(⃗r) = (z)un0(⃗r) and the envelope function (z) is the solution to the
one-dimensional Schrödinger equation

It results in discrete subband energies Em corresponding to discrete wave numbers
kz,m (m = 1, 2, 3,. . .). For a very deep well of thickness dz the eigenvalues Em

(2.107)
resulting in a step-like increase with rising energy as higher subbands overlap
(Fig. 2.14).
Typical semiconductor quantum wells are rather shallow, which causes the
wave function to penetrate into the barrier region. The distance of the energy
levels Em shrinks with lower barriers; however, the dependence Em = m2E1 is
maintained. The actual potential depths Ec and Ev of semiconductor quantum
wells are critical parameters in device simulations but they often are not exactly
known. Section 2.5 outlines several methods for estimating the band offsets.
The effective mass approximation given in Eq. (2.106) is reasonably accu-
rate only for decoupled bands like the conduction band. For the coupled valence
bands, the three-dimensional Schrödinger equation needs to be solved numeri-
cally, subtracting the quantum well potential Vqw(z) from the diagonal elements
of the Hamiltonian matrix in Eq. (2.36). Several numerical methods, for instance,
the propagation matrix method [21], the ﬁnite element method [40], and the ﬁnite
difference method [41] can be employed. Figure 2.15 illustrates the in-plane band
structure for different GaAs-based quantum wells withAlxGa1−xAs barriers.Alloy
materials like AlGaAs require the interpolation of binary material parameters
as described in Section 2.4. An unstrained 8-nm-wide GaAs quantum well with
Al0.15Ga0.85As barriers is evaluated in Fig. 2.15a. The same quantum well is used
for the device example in Chap. 11. Energy quantum levels are at different posi-
tions for heavy and light holes due to the different masses mz
hh and mz
lh. Valence
mixing effects lead to strongly nonparabolic dispersion functions with sometimes
negative effective masses at the  point (LH1, HH3). Figure 2.15b shows the same
quantum well at reduced thickness, which moves the energy levels toward the bar-
rier edge, reducing their total number (cf. Eq. (2.104)). In fact, the second subband
is barely conﬁned for heavy holes (HH2). Dashed lines show the parabolic dis-
persion obtained from the bulk masses mt
hh and mt
lh, which gives poor agreement.
Case (c) describes a 8-nm-wide GaAs quantum well with Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier,
which allows for the same number of energy levels as in (a). However, the higher
barrier slightly moves all levels further away from the well edge at 0 eV. Finally,
Fig. 2.15d shows a strained In0.05Ga0.95As quantum well where the well edge is
different for heavy and light holes (cf. Eqs. (2.40) and (2.41)). Therefore, only one
light-hole subband is supported. The very small barrier strain is neglected in all
four examples. These quantum wells shall be further investigated in Chap. 5.

states are extended. Effective mass approximations using Eqs. (2.48) and (2.49)
are indicated by dashed lines in (b). The GaAs wells are unstrained, compressive
strain in (d) splits the well edges for heavy and light holes.

Semiconductor Alloys
Optoelectronic devices often employ alloys of binary materials. Because of the
random distribution of elements from the same group within the alloy lattice, exact
calculations of material parameters are hardly possible. Instead, material param-
eters of quaternary alloys (Q) are predicted by interpolation of known binary (B) or
ternary (T) alloy data. Parameters of ternary alloys ABxC1−x are usually given as
TABC(x) = xBAB + (1 −x)BAC −x(1 −x)CABC
(2.108)
using an empirical bowing parameter CABC.According toVegard’s law, CABC = 0
for the lattice constant. Bowing is also not pronounced for the effective mass of
most alloys. However, strong bowing is often observed for the energy gap. Experi-
mentally determined bowing parameters for the direct band gap and the spin–orbit
splitting are listed in Table 2.8. It should be noted that the smallest band gap
may change from direct to indirect as composition is varied. This is the case for
AlxGa1−xAs at x = 0.42 (Fig. 2.16). Furthermore, strain causes an additional
change of the band gap energy (see Section 2.2.2).
Based on empirical interpolation formulas for ternary compounds, properties
of quaternary alloys AxB1−xCyD1−y can be interpolated as
Q(x, y) = [x(1 −x)[yTABC(x) + (1 −y)TABD(x)]
+ y(1 −y)[xTACD(y) + (1 −x)TBCD(y)]]/[x(1 −x) + y(1 −y)].
(2.109)
Alternatively, alloys of the type ABxCyD1−x−y are described by
Q(x, y) = xyTABC(u) + y(1 −x −y)TACD(v) + x(1 −x −y)TABD(w)
xy + y(1 −x −y) + x(1 −x −y)

As an example, Fig. 2.17 shows the direct band gap versus composition for various
quaternary III–V semiconductors lattice-matched to InP.

ferent semiconductors by introducing an average valence band energy E0

Chapter 3
Carrier Transport
Electrical current ﬂow in semiconductors is mainly dominated by drift
and diffusion of electrons and holes. This chapter reviews the physical
mechanisms that affect the carrier transport in optoelectronic devices, includ-
ing pn-junctions, thermionic emission at heterojunctions, and tunneling.
Simple formulas for the carrier mobility and for various carrier generation
and recombination mechanisms are given. Advanced transport models are
outlined at the end.
3.1
Drift and Diffusion
Semiconductor device simulation software most commonly uses the drift–
diffusion model to compute the ﬂow of electrons and holes. Drift current is
generated by an electric ﬁeld ⃗F and it is proportional to the conductivity of elec-
trons σn = qµnn and holes σp = qµpp. Diffusion current is driven by the
concentration gradient of electrons ∇n and holes ∇p. It is proportional to the dif-
fusion coefﬁcient Dn and Dp, respectively. For uniform semiconductors, the total
current density of electrons and holes is written as
⃗jn = qµnn ⃗F + qDn∇n
(3.1)
⃗jp = qµpp ⃗F −qDp∇p.
(3.2)
We consider the elementary charge q to always be a positive number, so that the
current ﬂows in the direction of the electric ﬁeld while the electrons move in oppo-
site direction. Both carriers diffuse “downhill” toward lower carrier concentration
while ∇n and ∇p point in the “uphill” direction.
Changes in the local carrier concentration in time must be accompanied by a
spatial change in current ﬂow (∇⃗j) and/or by the generation (rate G) or recombi-
nation (rate R) of electron–hole pairs. This relation is expressed by the continuity
equations
q ∂n
∂t = ∇· ⃗jn −q(R −G)
(3.3)
q ∂p
∂t = −∇· ⃗jp −q(R −G).
(3.4)

50
CHAPTER 3. CARRIER TRANSPORT
Finally, the electric ﬁeld itself is affected by the charge distribution, which
includes mobile (n, p) and ﬁxed charges (dopant ions pD, nA). This relationship
is described by the Poisson equation
∇· (ε0εst ⃗F) = q(p −n + pD −nA).
(3.5)
The net charge inside the device is zero; i.e., mobile and ﬁxed charges compensate
each other.
This set of equations constitutes the drift–diffusion model for the electrical
behavior of semiconductor devices; more general models are discussed at the
end of this chapter. The equations deliver the unknown functions n(⃗r, t), p(⃗r, t),
and ⃗F(⃗r, t) if appropriate initial and boundary conditions are considered (see
Section 3.5). Inside a semiconductor device, these quantities can vary by many
orders of magnitude. They are sometimes replaced by the electrostatic potential
φ and the quasi-Fermi levels EFn and EFp, which shall be introduced below and
which exhibit less dramatic variations.
3.2
pn-Junctions
At the junction of n-doped and p-doped semiconductor regions, both carriers
diffuse into the other region and recombine, creating a transition region that is
depleted of carriers (depletion width = wn + wp, see Fig. 3.1). The remaining
ionized donors and acceptors build an electric ﬁeld that counteracts the carrier
diffusion. With balanced drift and diffusion, no net current is ﬂowing. According
to the Poisson equation, the slope of the electric ﬁeld ∇⃗F is proportional to the
net charge; hence the maximum ﬁeld occurs at the pn-junction. Electrostatic ﬁeld
⃗F and potential φ are related by
⃗F = −∇φ;
(3.6)
i.e., the slope of the potential is given by the electric ﬁeld. In other words, the
potential does not change in regions with zero ﬁeld (and the ﬁeld does not change
in regions without charges — see Fig. 3.1). The built-in ﬁeld relates to a built-in
potential φbi and to a change of the band edge energies E = −qφbi across the
junction.
Without external bias, the Fermi level EF is a ﬂat line. The Fermi function
represents the electron distribution in thermal equilibrium, with zero net transfer
of electrons between different energy levels. The equilibrium can be disturbed
by external forces that provide additional electrons and/or holes. Providing elec-
trons from the right and holes from the left in Fig. 3.1 (forward bias) generates
excesscarriersinthedepletionregionthatcannotimmediatelyﬁndarecombination
partner. This nonequilibrium carrier distribution in valence and conduction band is
not described by the same Fermi function anymore. Assuming equilibrium within

each band, the excess carriers lead to the separation of Fermi levels for electrons
and holes. These quasi-Fermi levels EFn and EFp are illustrated in Fig. 3.2 for the
same pn-junction (note the larger length scale). Excess electrons and excess holes
penetrate some distance into the other region until recombination establishes an
equilibrium with single Fermi level. The diffusion length is proportional to the
square-root of the carrier lifetime before recombination (see Section 3.7).
3.3
Heterojunctions
Most modern optoelectronic devices utilize heterojunctions between different
semiconductor materials. They are used to restrict the ﬂow of carriers or to collect

Dashed lines give the quasi-Fermi levels with the carrier lifetime (ps) as the
parameter (EFp, holes; EFn, electrons). Extremely short lifetimes are used here for
illustration; minority lifetimes up to τn = 5 ns and τp = 3 µs have been measured
in GaAs [47].
carriers where they are needed. The band diagram of an n-doped AlGaAs/GaAs
heterojunction is plotted in Fig. 3.3.The most important junction parameters are the
offsets Ec and Ev of conduction and valence band edge, respectively. They add
up to the band gap difference Eg between both materials. The band offset varies
with the material system and it is often not exactly known. More details on the
band offset are given in Section 2.5.
The band bending near the heterojunction is caused by the redistribution of
electrons toward the material with the lower electron energy. The remaining donor
ions pull the electrons back and an equilibrium carrier proﬁle is established. In
Fig. 3.3, theAlGaAs side is depleted of electrons, which translates into a band edge

GaAs side as shown by the penetration of the Fermi level into the conduction band.
Without net current ﬂow, the Fermi level is perfectly ﬂat. It is the same on both
sides of the interface; i.e., the interface Fermi distribution of electrons is identical
on both sides. In other words, the same number of electrons penetrates the interface
from the left- and right-hand sides, resulting in zero net current. To achieve net

current across the junction, the carrier ﬂow in both directions must be asymmetric;
i.e., the electron quasi-Fermi levels on both sides of the interface must be different
(EFn,left ̸= EFn,right). This is expressed by the Richardson formula for thermionic
electron emission across a barrier (similar for holes):

(mc, average effective mass; A∗
n = 120Acm−2 K−2 for mc = m0). The expo-
nential factors describe the electron concentration on both sides in Boltzmann
approximation, which is valid for Ec,max −EF > 3kBT . The electron concentra-
tions are identical and the net current vanishes for EFn,left = EFn,right.
The current ﬂow across a heterojunction can be limited by thermionic emission
or by drift and diffusion. The latter case arises when the junction depletion width
is much larger than the carrier “free ﬂight” distance between two scattering events
(see Section 3.6). In that case, carrier penetration is mainly hindered by the high
resistance of the depleted region, and inclusion of the thermionic emission formula
in the drift–diffusion equations is not important. In the opposite case of small
depletion width, the electrons hit the barrier in “free ﬂight” and Eq. (3.7) needs
to be included. With very thin depletion region (high doping), electron tunneling
through the potential barrier may create an even stronger current than thermionic
emission.
3.4
Tunneling
Tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that results from the wave nature
of electrons. When an electron wave arrives at an energy barrier, one part of it gets
reﬂected and another part penetrates the barrier. The penetration depth depends on
the barrier height. If the barrier is thin enough, part of the electron wave continues
on the other side (Fig. 3.4). The tunnel probability or transparency T (E) of the

3.4. TUNNELING

barrier strongly depends on the electron energy E and on the barrier shape Ebar(z).
ThetransparencyT (E)isthesameinbothdirections;i.e.,anettunnelcurrentarises
only with different carrier distributions on both sides. The total tunnel current is
the sum of the tunnel currents at all allowed energy levels below the barrier peak
Emax. In calculating the tunnel current, all three dimensions of electron motion
need to be considered on both sides. For tunneling between two bulk regions with
parabolic energy bands, the tunnel current density can be written as

(3.9)
where Ez is the energy of motion perpendicular to the tunnel junction (similar
for holes). This equation neglects the difference between the effective masses on
both sides of the barrier [48]. Note that the tunnel current vanishes for EFn,left =
EFn,right.
For arbitrary barriers Ebar(z), the tunnel transparency needs to be calculated
numerically by solving the Schrödinger equation. Analytical solutions only exist
for idealized simple barrier shapes, e.g., for a rectangular barrier as shown in
Fig. 3.4. With a maximum barrier energy Emax and thickness d of the rectangular
barrier, the tunneling transparency is given by

(3.10)
Results are plotted in Fig. 3.4 for several barrier widths d. The tunnel probability
is high only for very thin barriers. Similar barriers occur in real optoelectronic
devices, for instance, between quantum wells. However, the internal electrical
ﬁeld changes the barrier shape. Furthermore, only discrete electron energy levels
exist within neighboring quantum wells, which need to line up for tunneling to
occur (resonant tunneling [49]). Thus, Eq. (3.10) only serves as an illustration
here; accurate solutions for real devices require numerical techniques.
The propagation matrix method is often used to account for tunneling through
arbitrary heterobarriers in semiconductor devices [50]. This method slices up the
barrier into many layers with piecewise constant potential; i.e., it replaces the real
shape Ebar(z) by a multiple-step function. The smaller the steps, the higher the
accuracy but the longer the computation time.

where a and b, respectively, specify the location at which the electron enters and
leaves the barrier (Ebar(a) = Ez, Ebar(b) = Ez). However, WKB approximations
should be applied with great care. If the requirement of a slowly varying potential
is not satisﬁed, like at heterojunctions, signiﬁcant error may arise [51].
Tunneling is a very rich and diverse phenomenon, especially when it comes to
real device applications. Examples are heterostructure effects on the wave function
[52] and phonon-assisted (inelastic) tunneling [53]. More details can be found in
specialized texts, e.g., in [54].
3.5
Boundary Conditions
At the device boundaries, the semiconductor is in contact with metals or with
insulating materials. For both cases, boundary conditions are needed for the three
unknown functions in the Poisson equation ( ⃗F or φ) and continuity equations
(n, p or EFn, EFp or jn, jp). Appropriate boundary conditions are essential for
successful device simulations. Boundary conditions also represent the external
bias applied to the device. In general, three types of boundary conditions can be
distinguished:
• Dirichlet boundary conditions give explicit values for the unknown func-
tions at the boundary.
• Neumann boundary conditions give explicit values for the derivative (slope)
of the unknown functions perpendicular to the boundary, which may
correspond to the ﬂux of particles or energy across the boundary.
• Mixed boundary conditions contain combinations of absolute and slope
values.
In addition to real physical boundaries, device simulations often use artiﬁcial
boundaries to reduce the size of the device region simulated. Such boundaries may
represent symmetry planes of the device not penetrated by the ﬂow of carriers or
energy. In this case, zero-slope Neumann conditions are appropriate. Otherwise,
artiﬁcial boundaries should be far away from the active parts of the device in order
to not affect the simulated device performance.
In the following, simple examples of steady-state boundary conditions for three
common types of physical interfaces are described. The direction normal to the
boundary is given by the vector ⃗ν, which may be identical to the x, y, or z direction.

The normal component of the electrostatic ﬁeld, for instance, is given by Fν = ⃗F ⃗ν
(Fig. 3.5). It is here assumed to vanish on the outer side of the boundary.
3.5.1
Insulator–Semiconductor Interface
Interfaces between semiconductors and dielectric materials (including air and vac-
uum) exhibit a high density of energy levels within the band gap. These levels are
created by the interruption of the crystal periodicity as well as by other defects.
Interface defects may trap carriers and build a signiﬁcant boundary charge density
Qb. These charges deﬁne the normal electrostatic ﬁeld at the boundary by the
Dirichlet condition

Interface defects may also enhance electron–hole recombination, characterized
by a surface recombination velocity vsr, which draws the interface recombination
current density
⃗jp⃗ν = −⃗jn⃗ν = qvsr(np −n0p0).
(3.14)
The surface recombination velocity is a material parameter that depends on the
surface treatment (e.g., passivation). Typical values for nonpassivated surfaces are

on the order of 105 cm/s for GaAs and 104 cm/s for InP. However, boundary defects
can often be ignored if these boundaries are far away from the active part of the
device.
3.5.2
Metal–Semiconductor Contact
For metals and semiconductors, the work function 	 = E0 −EF is the
average energy required to remove an electron from the crystal (E0, vacuum
energy, see Fig. 3.6). Work functions for various metals are listed in Table 3.1.
The work function of semiconductors depends on the doping (cf. Fig. 1.6). The
metal–semiconductor work function difference
	MS = 	M −	S
(3.15)
can be negative or positive, which, together with the doping type, determines
the nature of the contact: Ohmic contact with linear current–voltage relation or
Schottky contact with current rectifying properties like a diode.

energy by moving into the semiconductor, forming a low-resistance accumulation
region.1 This allows for a simple Dirichlet boundary condition
φ = Vbias −φbi
(3.16)
with the applied external bias Vbias and the built-in potential φbi (cf. Section 3.2).
In fact, the absolute value of the boundary potential is not important, as long as
the difference between the contacts is equal to the external bias. A time-dependent
bias Vbias(t) requires the time-dependent solution of the semiconductor equations.
Equation (3.16) describes voltage-controlled contacts. Alternatively, the contact
can be controlled by the applied current Icon. In that case, integration over the
contact area gives
Icon =

dA(⃗jn + ⃗jp)⃗ν,
(3.17)
which can be transformed into a more complicated boundary condition for the
potential using Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2). The boundary conditions for the carrier con-
centrations are obtained by assuming thermal equilibrium and charge neutrality.
This allows for the following two conditions to be established at the boundary
np −n0p0 = 0
(3.18)
p −n + pD −nA = 0
(3.19)
with the equilibrium concentrations n0 and p0. These two equations can be
transformed into explicit Dirichlet conditions for n and p [56].

Schottky Contacts
Figure 3.7 shows an n-type semiconductor brought into contact with a metal of
higher work function. Due to the positive work function difference 	MS, electrons

are able to lower their energy by moving from the semiconductor into the metal,
forming a depletion region.2 A Schottky barrier of height
φs = 	M −χ0
(3.20)
is formed, which makes it difﬁcult to inject electrons into the semiconductor
(χ0, electron afﬁnity, see Table 2.9). In opposite direction, the semiconductor
surface potential is 	MS at zero bias and it changes with the applied bias. Thus,
the resistance of the Schottky contact depends on the direction of the current
ﬂow.
Schottky contacts are difﬁcult to describe mathematically as they involve
complicated transport mechanisms like thermionic emission and quantum
tunneling (see [57] for a detailed discussion). However, in case they are not essen-
tial for the device performance, Schottky contacts are often treated in a strongly
simpliﬁed way. The surface potential can be given by
φ = Vbias −φs.
(3.21)
The carrier concentrations at the contact depend on the current densities. Various
current boundary condition can be found in the literature [56, 58] with the

3.6
Carrier Mobility
The carrier mobility is the key material parameter in transport simulations. It
is limited by collisions of electrons and holes with other carriers, with crystal
defects, and with phonons (lattice vibrations). Those scattering events slow down
thecarriersandconstitutetheelectricalresistanceofthematerial.Usingtheaverage
carrier “ﬂight” time τsc between two scatter events, the Drude model simply writes
the carrier mobility as
µ = τsc
q
mn
(3.26)
with the effective mass mn. Note that, when combining bands or directions, the
mobility effective mass differs from the density-of-states effective mass [2, 7, 9].
The time τsc depends signiﬁcantly on the microstructure of the semiconductor, on
theelectricﬁeld,andonthetemperature.Theoreticalapproachesoftencalculatethe
scattering time τsc for speciﬁc scatter mechanisms (see reviews in [2, 53]).The total
mobility can then be obtained by adding up the results for all relevant scatter
mechanisms. This scatter theory approach results in complicated equations that
include some physical parameters that are hardly known for many semiconductors.
Instead, for practical device simulation, empirical mobility formulas that are ﬁtted
to measurements are often used. We shall summarize some common mobility
functions in the following. Compared to the vast amount of research on silicon
(see reviews in [53, 56]), relatively few mobility formulas have been published for

III–V compounds. If available, mobility measurements should be used to verify
these approximations.
Near room temperature (T = 300 K) and at low electric ﬁelds, the function
µ(T ) is often approximated as
µ(T ) = µo

.
(3.27)
Since the mobility is affected by scattering at donors, acceptors, and other
defects, it is often desirable to give the mobility as a function of the doping density
Ndop. The following expression was originally extracted for Si [65] and has later
been successfully applied to GaAs [66] and other compounds
µ(Ndop) = µdop +
µo −µdop
1 + (Ndop/Nref )α ,
(3.28)
where µo is the maximum mobility (no doping) and µdop is the minimum mobility
for high doping densities. A temperature dependence of the form (3.27) can be
included for any of the parameters µo, µdop, µ1 = µo −µdop, Nref , and α [62,
63, 67]. Corresponding exponents δ0, δdop, δ1, δref , and δα are given in Table 3.2,
together with the other parameters of Eqs. (3.27) and (3.28). For electrons and
holes in GaAs, Eq. (3.28) is plotted in Fig. 3.8 for two different temperatures.
The inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld F on the mobility can be neglected as long
as the carrier drift velocity vdr = µF is much smaller than the Brownian velocity
of random motion (≈107 cm/s). In this low-ﬁeld case, the current density jn =
qnvdr is proportional to the electric ﬁeld (Ohm’s law). With high ﬁelds, the total
electron energy of motion becomes large enough to generate longitudinal optical
phonons,whicheventuallyleadstoavelocitysaturationneartheBrownianvelocity
(Fig. 3.9). A commonly used model for the high-ﬁeld electron mobility µ(F) in
Si has the form
µ(F) =

1 + (µlowF/vs)β ,
(3.29)
with the low ﬁeld mobility µlow, the saturation velocity vs = 1.1 × 107 cm/s, and
the ﬁt parameter β = 2 [56]. The same relationship is usually applied to holes in
various semiconductors; parameters are listed in Table 3.3. However, the electron
mobility in compound semiconductors like GaAs shows a different behavior. Due
to electron scattering into side valleys of the conduction band (cf. Fig. 2.6), electron
mobility and velocity may exhibit a discrete maximum at larger ﬁelds (Fig. 3.9).
In this case, the electron mobility is often approximated by the formula
µn(F) = µ0 + (vsn/F0)(F/F0)3
1 + (F/F0)4

High-ﬁeld mobility parameters for some semiconductors are given in Table 3.3;
results for other materials are reviewed in [4, 68, 69, 70]. The carrier mobility of
nitrides is discussed in Section 9.2.1.
Parallel to surfaces or interfaces, the scattering mechanisms that limit carrier
transport are different from bulk mechanisms and special theoretical models have
been developed (see, e.g., [53, 56]).
Drift and diffusion of carriers are both limited by the same scatter mechanisms.
For parabolic bands and thermal equilibrium, mobility and diffusion coefﬁcient of
electrons are connected by [71]

3.7. ELECTRON–HOLE RECOMBINATION
67
3.7
Electron–Hole Recombination
The recombination rate R in the continuity equations (3.3) and (3.4) includes
various physical mechanisms. In order to drop from the conduction to the valence
band, electrons need to transfer their excess energy to other particles (electrons,
phonons, photons). The main mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 3.10. They are
radiative (photon emission) or nonradiative (no photon emission).
3.7.1
Radiative Recombination
The generation of photons by radiative recombination can be spontaneous or
stimulated. Within bulk layers, the spontaneous emission rate of photons is often
characterized by the material coefﬁcient B and written as
Rspon = B(np −n0p0).
(3.34)
The net recombination rate depends both on the availability of electrons in the
conduction band and holes in the valence band. It vanishes in thermal equilibrium
with np = n0p0. Practically, B is often determined as the second-order coefﬁcient
(BN2) in a polynomial ﬁt to measurements as a function of average carrier con-
centration N, which results in a wide spreading of reported parameters.Aselection

of room-temperature values is given in Fig. 3.11 for various direct-band-gap semi-
conductors and their alloys. The parameter B decreases with higher temperature
[72] and with tensile strain [73].
Photons can be absorbed in the generation of new electron–hole pairs but they
can also trigger recombination and the stimulated emission of another photon.
The local stimulated emission rate is proportional to the optical ﬁeld intensity
Iopt (W/cm2)
Rstim = g Iopt
¯hω
(3.35)
with the optical gain g as a material parameter (¯hω, photon energy). Both spon-
taneous and stimulated emission are of paramount importance in light-emitting
optoelectronic devices, and they are further discussed in Chapter 5.
3.7.2
Nonradiative Recombination
The two main nonradiative processes are Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombi-
nation and Auger recombination. With Auger recombination, the excess energy is

3.7. ELECTRON–HOLE RECOMBINATION
69
transferred to another electron within the valence or conduction band (Fig. 3.10).
Auger recombination may involve different valence bands and the interaction with
phonons [77]. The Auger recombination rate is given by
RAug = (Cnn + Cpp)(np −n0p0),
(3.36)
with theAuger coefﬁcients Cn and Cp whose temperature dependence is written as
C(T ) = Co exp



(3.37)
(Ea, activation energy). Practically, the Auger parameter C is often determined
as the third-order coefﬁcient (CN3) in a polynomial ﬁt to measurements at
different carrier concentrations N [72]. Reported room-temperature values are
given in Fig. 3.12 as a function of direct band gap energy. Depending on the
dominating Auger mechanism, the experimental parameter C represents some
combination of the theoretical Auger coefﬁcients Cn and Cp. Auger recom-
bination in long-wavelength InGaAsP quantum wells is further discussed in
Chapter 7.

CHAPTER 3. CARRIER TRANSPORT
SRH recombination involves energy levels deep inside the semiconductor band
gap that are generated by crystal defects. Such deep-level defects are able to cap-
ture electrons from the conduction band as well as holes from the valence band
and thereby serve as recombination centers. They are characterized by capture
coefﬁcients cn and cp, trap density Nt, and trap energy Et. The capture coefﬁcient
is proportional to the capture cross section, which depends on the nature of the
defect[2].Excesselectronenergyisreleasedbyphonons.Basedonsimplestatistics
[78, 79], the net electron transition rates from the conduction band Rn and to the
valence band Rp is given by
Rn = cnn(1 −ft)Nt −cnn1ftNt
(3.38)
Rp = cppftNt −cpp1(1 −ft)Nt
(3.39)

(n1p1 = n2

difference of the inﬂow and outﬂow of electrons
Nt
∂ft
∂t = Rn −Rp.
(3.42)
In thermodynamic equilibrium, the net carrier ﬂow through the recombination
center vanishes (Rn = Rp = 0). Under steady-state conditions, the carrier ﬂow is
constant (Rn = Rp) and the electron concentration in the trap is given by
nt = ftNt =
cnn + cpp1
cn(n + n1) + cp(p + p1)Nt.
(3.43)
The corresponding net SRH recombination rate is
RSRH = Nt
cncp(np −n0p0)
cn(n + n1) + cp(p + p1).
(3.44)
The capture coefﬁcients cn and cp for electrons and holes relate to SRH lifetimes

i.e., SRH recombination is dominated by the more rare recombination partner
(minority carrier). Semiconductor materials exhibit different types of defects
depending on the fabrication process. Thus, the SRH lifetimes are quite uncer-
tain parameters and should be obtained from ﬁts to measurements. Typical values
are in the nanosecond to microsecond range.
Measured carrier lifetimes τn and τp involve all recombination mechanisms,
and they are shorter than SRH lifetimes. For instance, in p-doped material,

Electron–Hole Generation
Similar to their recombination, the generation of electron–hole pairs requires the
interaction with other particles. As illustrated in Fig. 3.13, the transition energy
can be provided by phonons (thermal generation), photons (absorption), or other
electrons (impact ionization).
The net recombination rates given in the previous section already include
thermal generation as they vanish under thermal equilibrium, np = n0p0. Thermal
ionizationofimpurityatomsisconsideredbytheneutralityconditionofthePoisson
equation (3.5). Both thermal generation processes are reﬂected in the equilibrium
Fermi distribution of carriers (cf. Chap. 1).
3.8.1
Photon Absorption
Optical electron–hole pair generation by photon absorption is the key physical
mechanism in photodetectors and other electroabsorption devices (see Chapters 11
and 10, respectively). Material aspects of band-to-band absorption are evaluated in
Section 4.2.1. It is opposite to stimulated photon emission and included in the net
optical gain (see Chap. 5). Negative gain represents net absorption. Due to absorp-
tion, the light intensity decreases as the light penetrates deeper into the device.

with ¯hω giving the photon energy and Iopt(0) the optical intensity at the surface

3.8.2
Impact Ionization
Impact ionization is of main importance in devices like avalanche photodetectors,
which utilize strong electric ﬁelds F and high carrier drift velocities to gener-
ate electron–hole pairs. Impact ionization is opposite to Auger recombination
as it absorbs the energy of motion of another electron or hole to generate an
electron–hole pair. Typically, the impact ionization rate is given as
Gimp(F) = αn(F)jn + αp(F)jp
q
(3.51)
with ionization coefﬁcients αn and αp for electrons and holes, respectively. The
ionization coefﬁcients strongly depend on the electric ﬁeld (Fig. 3.14), and reported

In some semiconductors, ionization coefﬁcients are affected by the crystal
direction [80].
Various alternative models can be found in the literature, especially for sili-
con [56]. The following approximation has been adopted for several compound
semiconductors (Table 3.5) [81]:

The carrier energy gained over the mean free path is qFλn,p, and it can be much
lower (low-ﬁeld case) or much higher (high-ﬁeld case) than the phonon energy.
Energy conservation demands that the energy of the ionizing carrier is at least as
large as the band gap energy (cf. Fig. 3.13). However, momentum conservation
is also required, which leads to a considerably larger ionization threshold energy

For electrons in GaAs and InP, all three of the above models for the ionization
coefﬁcients are compared in Fig. 3.15, illustrating the differences between reported
data. These simple impact ionization models assume that the carriers are traveling
in a constant electric ﬁeld. This is often not the case in real devices, and the
ionization rates are typically overestimated by above formulas. For a more detailed
discussion of impact ionization, see [9, 53, 56, 57, 88, 89].

Band-to-Band Tunneling
Finally, carriers can be generated without additional energy, by band-to-band tun-
neling with strong electric ﬁelds F > 106 V/cm (Fig. 3.16). The corresponding

CHAPTER 3. CARRIER TRANSPORT
This simple band-to-band tunneling model assumes a constant electrical ﬁeld
accross the tunnel junction, which may be not the case (cf. Fig. 3.16). Accurate
treatment of tunneling in real devices requires more sophisticated numerical
methods (cf. Section 3.4).
3.9
Advanced Transport Models
Thus far, this chapter has focused on the widely used drift–diffusion model for
the carrier transport in semiconductor devices. However, more advanced transport
models have been developed, some of which are brieﬂy outlined in the following.
For simplicity, the crystal lattice temperature TL is assumed uniform and constant
in this section. Lattice heating effects are discussed in Chap. 6.
3.9.1
Energy Balance Model
In thermal equilibrium, the average energy of motion per carrier equals 3kBTL/2.
In order to include nonequilibrium carrier distributions with higher average energy,
the carrier temperatures Tn and Tp are introduced as new independent parameters
for electrons and holes, respectively. In thermal equilibrium, Tn and Tp are equal
to the lattice temperature TL. With the carrier energy as new unknown parameter,
energy balance equations have been developed in addition to the carrier balance
equations in the drift–diffusion model [92, 93, 94].
Several new quantities are used in the energy balance model. Multiplying
the average carrier energy by the carrier concentration gives the carrier energy
densities

which are functions of local position ⃗r and time t. The ﬂow of carrier energy can
be independent from the ﬂow of carriers. The carrier energy ﬂux densities are
given by
⃗Sn = −κn∇Tn + πn ⃗jn
(3.66)
⃗Sp = −κp∇Tp + πp ⃗jp,
(3.67)
representing conductive (ﬁrst term) and convective (second term) heat transport by
carriers. The latter is also known as the Peltier effect with the Peltier coefﬁcients
πn and πp for electrons and holes, respectively. The carrier thermal conductivities

The ﬁrst term describes variations of the band edges as the driving force, including
the electrostatic potential (drift) as well as variations of material composition
and band gap (Fig. 3.17a). The common diffusion term is second, employing
the Einstein relation for the diffusion coefﬁcients. Carrier temperature variations

are the driving force in the third term. The generation of current by temperature
gradients ∇T is called the Seebeck effect with the thermoelectric powers Pn and
Pp (V/K), respectively, as material parameter. The thermoelectric power accounts
for the extra energy of carriers above the Fermi level. This energy increases with
higher temperature due to the wider spreading of the Fermi function. When a
temperature gradient occurs, carriers move from hot regions to cold regions in
order to reduce that extra energy (Fig. 3.17b). For nondegenerate semiconductors,

ThelastterminEqs.(3.70)and(3.71)accountsforspatialvariationsoftheeffective

In the drift–diffusion model, Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) represent a conservation law
for carriers. The energy conservation law is represented by the energy balance
equations

With constant total energy of electrons, the local change of their energy density
∂wn/∂t must be compensated for by the net ﬂow of electron energy ∇· ⃗Sn at
that location (same for holes). Thus, the right-hand side (RHS) of these equations

3.9. ADVANCED TRANSPORT MODELS
81
is zero as long as no carrier energy is gained or lost. Energy loss or gain can be
related to the recombination or generation of electrons and holes (ﬁrst term on
RHS). Energy gain can also be caused by Joule heating, as given in the second
RHS term. Without scattering, the current ﬂow toward lower band energy sepa-
rates the carriers from the band edge as they maintain their energy (Fig. 3.17c).
Carrier scattering eventually transforms this energy gain into lattice heating. Such
relaxation of electrons from higher to lower band energies is described by the third
RHS term with the energy relaxation time τE. The relaxation times are the key
material parameters of the energy balance model, as they determine how quickly
carriers reach an equilibrium Fermi distribution with Tn = Tp = TL. This is of
special importance for quantum wells, for instance, where electrons entering the
well suddenly have too much energy (hot electrons), which needs to be dissipated
in order to populate quantum levels (Fig. 3.17d). The parameter τE is hardly mea-
surable, and it is often calculated by Monte Carlo analysis [95]. The relaxation time
τE, the mobility µn and other parameters depend on the energy or temperature of
carriers. In temperature-dependent formulas for the effective density of states and
other quantities, the lattice temperature is replaced by the corresponding carrier
temperature.
3.9.2
Boltzmann Transport Equation
Drift–diffusion and energy balance model are both simpliﬁed versions of a more
general treatment of carrier transport. It employs the general electron distribution
function f (⃗r, ⃗k, t), which can be understood as a combination of local distribution
n(⃗r, t) and energy distribution f (E, t). The Boltzmann transport equation gives
the time derivative

(3.78)
The ﬁrst term of the middle part represents the direct time dependence of f ; it is
zero under steady-state conditions. The second term includes carrier momentum
changes due to the electric ﬁeld (∂⃗k/∂t = −q ⃗F/¯h, ∇k describes the derivative
in ⃗k space). The third term includes the carrier velocity ∂⃗r/∂t = ⃗v; it vanishes
for homogeneous semiconductors (∇f = 0). The by-far most complicated part
of the Boltzmann equation is the right-hand side, which integrates all possible
collision mechanisms. It includes any change of momentum ¯h⃗k or energy E due
to scatter events, both elastic (E constant) and inelastic (E changed). The RHS of
the Boltzmann equation vanishes for carrier equilibrium when f is identical to the
Fermi distribution function.
Finding solutions to this complicated integro-differential equation has been a
challenge for countless researchers over decades. Among the direct methods of
solution, the most important ones are the Monte Carlo method, which numerically

employing a momentum relaxation time τm to describe how quickly f assumes an
equilibrium distribution f0 after all external forces are turned off. In this approach,
τm is the only material parameter, leading to a more general deﬁnition of the carrier
mobility and other material parameters [89].
Drift–diffusion and energy balance model can be derived from the Boltzmann
transport equation by the method of moments. This method multiplies the entire
equation by a speciﬁc quantity and then averages over the entire ⃗k space [53]. It
leads to conservation laws for the carrier concentration (zeroth moment, Eq. (3.3)),
for the current density (ﬁrst moment, Eqs. (3.70) or (3.1)), and for the carrier
energy density (second moment, Eq. (3.77)). Besides the energy balance model
(Section 3.9.1), a variety of more sophisticated carrier transport models has been
established this way, including the hydrodynamic model [96] and the energy
transport model [97].

Optical Waves
Optical waves are combinations of high-frequency electrical ﬁelds ⃗E and
magnetic ﬁelds ⃗H in the wavelength range from the infrared through the vis-
ible to the ultraviolet light (Fig. 4.1). The mathematical treatment of optical
waves is embedded in the classical theory of electromagnetic ﬁelds based on
Maxwell’s equations. These general equations lead to the Helmholtz wave
equations, which govern wave optics. As the intensity distribution of the opti-
cal wave is of main interest, scalar approximations of those equations are often
employed. Ray optics represent a further simpliﬁcation for optical structures
much larger than the wavelength. Entire books are devoted to optical wave
theory, and a great variety of numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz
equations within wave guiding structures has been developed. This chapter
gives a basic introduction to optical wave theory, focusing on semiconductor
optoelectronic device issues.

with the electrical permittivity εε0 and the magnetic permeability µµ0 describing
the interaction of the material with electrical and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively, in
linear approximation (ε0, µ0, free-space values; ⃗j, current density; ϱ, charge den-
sity). Maxwell’s equations are the fundamental basis for the classical treatment
of electrical and magnetic ﬁelds. For high-frequency optical waves and semi-
conductor waveguides, several simpliﬁcations are possible as discussed in the
following.
The charge density ϱ acts as source of the electrostatic ﬁeld ⃗F, and it can be
neglected in the case of high-frequency optical ﬁelds ⃗E (cf. Poisson equation (3.5)).
Thus, the source-free divergence equations (4.3) and (4.4) indicate that both the
electrical and the magnetic parts of the optical ﬁeld are closed curls and do not orig-
inate from single sources. Magnetic ﬁeld variations in time ∂⃗H/∂t generate curls
∇× ⃗E of the electrical ﬁeld (Eq. (4.1)).Vice versa, electrical ﬁeld variations in time

The steady-state or low-frequency current density ⃗j = σ ⃗F can be excluded here
(σ, conductivity at low frequencies). The remaining “optical” current density
⃗j = σopt ⃗E depends on the semiconductor conductivity σopt at high frequencies.
Even without any carriers present, the wavelike change of ⃗E(⃗r, t) and ⃗H(⃗r, t) con-
stantly generates the other ﬁeld, thereby keeping the electromagnetic wave alive
(free space: ε = 1, µ = 1, ⃗j = 0, ϱ = 0).
The interaction of the magnetic ﬁeld vector ⃗H with semiconductors is typically
weak, and it will be neglected in the following (µ = 1). The electrical ﬁeld
⃗E interacts with free and bound charges in semiconductors. Under the inﬂuence
of the electrical ﬁeld, bound charges (valence electrons and ionic atom cores)
are slightly separated from their average position, thereby creating an internal
electrical polarization
⃗P = ε0χ ⃗E
(4.5)
with the electrical susceptibility χ as material parameter, which is related to the
dielectric constant by ε = χ + 1. In anisotropic materials, the susceptibility χ is
a matrix and the polarization ﬁeld ⃗P points in a different direction than ⃗E.
However, most semiconductors of interest here belong to the cubic crystal sys-
tem and can be considered isotropic.1 Furthermore, the polarization depends on
the frequency of the electric ﬁeld. At low frequencies and long wavelengths,
all charges are able to respond to the ﬁeld variation. At higher frequencies and
shorter wavelengths (below λ ≈10 µm), the more heavy ionic atom cores

cannot follow the ﬁeld variations any more. Thus, the semiconductor’s response
to optical ﬁelds is mainly governed by electrons in the valence and conduction
bands. The values of material parameters at optical frequencies are different from
static parameters.2 Whereas the static dielectric constant εst is used for static and
low-frequency ﬁelds ⃗F, the high-frequency value εopt is employed for optical
ﬁelds ⃗E.
Assuming monochromatic radiation and time-harmonic ﬁeld variations ∝
exp(iωt) with the angular frequency ω = 2πν, we obtain the semiconductor
Maxwell equations in the frequency domain
∇× ⃗E = −iωµ0 ⃗H

∇× ⃗H = (σopt + iωεoptε0)⃗E
(4.7)
∇· εoptε0⃗E = 0
(4.8)
∇· µ0 ⃗H = 0,
(4.9)
where ⃗E and ⃗H were changed to the time-independent ﬁelds ⃗E and ⃗H, respec-
tively. The term (σopt + iωεoptε0) suggests a complex number generalization of
the dielectric constant.
4.2
Dielectric Function
The dielectric function ε(ω) describes the response of a material to an electrical
ﬁeld ⃗E. This response depends on the angular frequency ω of the ﬁeld so that its
value for high-frequency optical ﬁelds (εopt) is different from the value at low-
frequency or static ﬁelds (εst). In order to include absorption, the dielectric function
is written in complex notation
˜ε(ω) = ε′(ω) + iε′′(ω)
(4.10)
with the real part ε′ describing polarization and the imaginary part ε′′ describing
gain (ε′′ > 0) or absorption (ε′′ < 0). Note that complex numbers are an artiﬁcial
construction for mathematical convenience. Any real physical quantity is repre-
sented by a real number, which can be the real part (ε′ = Re{˜ε}) or the imaginary
part (ε′′ = Im{˜ε}) of the complex number.
Instead of ˜ε, the complex refractive index
˜n(ω) = nr(ω) + ika(ω)
(4.11)
2Exceptions are nonpolar semiconductors like Si and Ge.

is often used with ˜n2 = ˜ε. The (real) refractive index nr reduces the free-space
light velocity c0 to

(P indicates a Cauchy principal integral that excludes the singular point ω = ω0)
[20]. The Kramers–Krönig relations permit us to determine either the real or the
imaginary component if the other is known for all frequencies. For example,
knowledge of the full absorption spectrum αo(ω) allows for the calculation of
the refractive index nr at any frequency ω0. Without any absorption, nr ≡1 at all
frequencies. An absorption peak at a given wavelength most strongly affects the
refractive index close to that wavelength. For GaAs, the spectra αo(λ0) and nr(λ0)
are plotted in Fig. 4.3. The details are discussed in the following. Many theoretical
material models analyze the relevant absorption mechanisms ﬁrst and then derive
the refractive index using the Kramers–Krönig relation.
4.2.1
Absorption Coefﬁcient
Band-to-band electron transitions from the valence to the conduction band
constitute the main absorption process in optoelectronic devices such as pho-
todetectors and electroabsorption modulators. In direct semiconductors like GaAs
and InP, the absorption for photon energies ¯hω above the band gap Eg can be
approximated as
αo ∝

¯hω −Eg.

static dielectric constant εst and for the optical dielectric constant εopt is indicated

For indirect semiconductors like Si and Ge, phonons need to be involved to provide
momentum, and the band-to-band absorption coefﬁcient can be described as
αo ∝(¯hω ± EP −Eg)2
(4.24)
with the phonon energy EP (plus/minus stands for phonon absorption/generation).
Additional bands with slightly higher gap energy may also be important (like the

several semiconductors are given in Fig. 4.4. As the bands ﬁll up with carriers, the

partially compensated for by band gap reduction with higher carrier concentration
N (see Section 2.1). For the optical band gap, a Moss–Burstein correction of
Eg = 1.6 × 10−8 N1/3 was given for InP-based compounds [100]. The band
gap Eg is also affected by temperature and strain (see Chap. 2). Band-to-band
transitions are further discussed in Chap. 5.
For photon energies slightly below the optical band gap, the absorption
coefﬁcient was found to change exponentially as
αo = Atail exp

(4.25)
with material parameters Atail = 3000/cm and Etail = 10 meV for GaAs and InP
[100]. Etail is also referred to as the Urbach parameter, and it accounts for band
tails in doped or disordered semiconductors [69].
As the band-to-band absorption decays with lower photon energy, transitions
within conduction and valence band(s), respectively, emerge as the dominant
absorption mechanism. These are often called free-carrier absorption; however,

different types of transitions can be involved (Fig. 4.5). In general, one distin-
guishes intraband transitions within the same band, involving phonons, and inter-
band transitions between different bands. The free-carrier absorption coefﬁcient
can be approximated as a linear function of the carrier concentration
αo = knn + kpp.
(4.26)
In InP and related compounds, intervalence band absorption (IVBA) is of special
importance within the ﬁber optic wavelength window (1.3–1.6 µm) as the energy
separation between valence bands matches the photon energy. The IVBA coefﬁ-
cient was found to be very similar in p-doped InP, GaAs, and In0.53Ga0.47As with
kp = 13 × 10−18 cm2 at 1.3 µm and 25 × 10−18 cm2 at 1.6 µm [101]. Transitions
within the conduction band cause much weaker absorption in n-doped material;

coefﬁcient can be related to the high-frequency electrical conductivity σopt by
αo =

(4.27)
and it is proportional to λp with p = 2 . . . 3 [103].
At even lower photon energies, absorption is dominated by interactions with
the crystal lattice (reststrahlen region, see Fig. 4.3). However, those wavelengths
are usually not of interest in optoelectronics.
4.2.2
Index of Refraction
For photon energies below the band gap, empirical oscillator models are often
used to describe the wavelength (energy) dependence of the refractive index.Those
models reﬂect the fact that optical waves interact with charged particles that behave
like mechanical oscillators. However, the oscillator frequencies used are often
pure ﬁt parameters. One of the most popular models for dielectric materials is the

ﬁcients can be interpolated to ﬁnd formulas for multinary compounds (InGaAsP
[100], AlGaInAs [105], AlGaInP [106]). A single-effective-oscillator model was
proposed by Wemple and DiDomenico [107], giving

with the oscillator energy Eo and the dispersion energy Ed as adjustable param-

[108, 109]. However, both of these phenomenological models tend to underes-
timate the refractive index at photon energies close to the semiconductor band gap
[100]. There, the refractive index is mainly inﬂuenced by band-to-band absorption
processes. Accordingly, Afromowitz has modiﬁed the single-oscillator model to
include absorption at the band gap energy Eg,

photon energies close to and above the band gap Eg [69]. The model can be

and showing good agreement with measurements on GaN, AlN, and InN
[112] (see Section 9.2.4 for nitride alloys). Adachi’s refractive index model
has been applied to Si and Ge [113] as well as to many III–V compounds
used in optoelectronics (AlGaAs [114]; InGaAsP [115]; AlGaAsSb, GaInAsSb,
and InPAsSb [116]; AlGaInP [117]; ZnCdTe [118]; AlGaInN [119]). However,
for speciﬁc materials and selected wavelength regions, tailored models may
show better agreement with measurements (see, e.g., [100] for InGaAsP with
¯hω ≈Eg).
For lower energies near the transversal optical phonon energy, the refractive
index is affected by photon interaction with the crystal lattice [2]. The phonon
energy translates into the reststrahlen wavelength, which separates the optical
wavelength region (nr ≈√εopt) from the low-frequency region (nr ≈√εst) as
illustrated in Fig. 4.3. All three parameters are listed in Table 4.3.
The effect of the free carrier concentration on the refractive index is
related to band gap renormalization, band ﬁlling, and free-carrier absorption.

It has been investigated in [121] for InP, GaAs, and InGaAsP. Refractive
index changes with temperature are mainly based on the dependence Eg(T )
and are often considered in linear approximation using the parameter dnr/dT
(Table 4.3).
4.3
Boundary Conditions
The behavior of the electromagnetic ﬁelds ⃗E and ⃗H at material boundaries is of
great importance in the treatment of optoelectronic devices, which often feature
different semiconductor layers. Let us consider a boundary between material 1
and material 2 with the electromagnetic ﬁelds at both sides of the boundary being
represented by ⃗E1, ⃗H1 and ⃗E2, ⃗H2. The direction normal to the boundary, from
medium 2 to medium 1, is given by the unit normal vector ⃗ν (Fig. 4.6). By inte-
grating the ﬁrst two Maxwell equations over a small area across the boundary, the
following boundary conditions are obtained for the tangential ﬁeld components
E∥and H∥parallel to the interface
⃗ν × (⃗E1 −⃗E2) = E∥,1 −E∥,2 = 0
(4.35)
⃗ν × (⃗H1 −⃗H2) = H∥,1 −H∥,2 = ⃗js,
(4.36)

4.4. PLANE WAVES

where ⃗js (A/cm) is the surface current density of carriers moving along the inter-
face. If ⃗js = 0, both the tangential components E∥and H∥of the optical wave
pass the semiconductor interface unchanged. Integrating the other two Maxwell
equations over a small volume across the boundary, conditions for the normal ﬁeld
components E⊥and H⊥are obtained
⃗ν · (ε1⃗E1 −ε2⃗E2) = ε1E⊥,1 −ε2E⊥,2 = ϱs/ε0
(4.37)
⃗ν · (µ1 ⃗H1 −µ2 ⃗H2) = µ1H⊥,1 −µ2H⊥,2 = 0
(4.38)
with ϱs (C/cm2) representing the interface charge density. Thus, even when static
charge densities are neglected, the normal component of the electrical ﬁeld does
change at material interfaces due to the difference in dielectric constants. The
normal component H⊥of the magnetic ﬁeld does not change at semiconductor
boundaries if µ1 = µ2 = 1. However, at semiconductor–metal boundaries, inter-
face charges are relevant. Optical waves disappear inside a perfect conductor due
to screening by free electrons at the interface. This can be accounted for by using
an appropriate imaginary part of the metal’s dielectric constant.
4.4
Plane Waves
Optical waves in free space and in isotropic media are often approximated as plane
waves for which ⃗E and ⃗H point in a constant direction and lie in a plane normal
to the direction of the propagation given by the wave vector ⃗k. Such a wave is also
called transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave. The ﬁelds are given as

with the free-space values k0 and λ0. The phase velocity becomes c = c0/nr with
the free-space light velocity c0 = 1/√ε0µ0. Through Maxwell’s equations, the
two ﬁeld amplitudes are related by
⃗k × ⃗E0 = ωµ0 ⃗H0
(4.42)
⃗k × ⃗H0 = −ωεε0⃗E0

Dividing by the photon energy gives the photon ﬂux density (number of photons

The time-averaged local optical energy density (W/cm3) is given by
Wopt = εoptε0|⃗E0|2,
(4.50)
assuming an equal amount of energy in the electrical and magnetic components.
4.5
Plane Waves at Interfaces
When plane waves encounter a material boundary, the tangential and normal com-
ponents of ⃗E0 and ⃗H0 are affected quite differently, as outlined in Section 4.3. Two
speciﬁc ﬁeld polarizations of TEM waves are usually considered, which are typical
for multilayer waveguides. In transverse electric (TE) polarization, the electrical
ﬁeld is parallel to the interface (⃗ETE
0
= Ey in Fig. 4.8). In transverse magnetic
(TM) polarization, the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the interface (⃗HTM
0
= Hy). In
both cases, the angle of reﬂection ϑr is equal to the angle of incidence ϑi and the
angle of transmission (angle of refraction) ϑt is given by Snell’s law
nr1 sin ϑi = nr2 sin ϑt.
(4.51)
The boundary conditions lead to the following relations between the electric ﬁeld
strengths Er, Et, and Ei of reﬂected, transmitted, and incident waves, respectively.
For TE waves, Eq. (4.35) gives

angle ϑc with
sin ϑc = nr2/nr1.

The fundamental equations (4.52), (4.53), (4.61), and (4.62) are also referred to
as Fresnel equations. The reﬂectance |r12|2 is plotted in Fig. 4.9 and it is lower
for TM waves than for TE waves. It becomes zero for TM waves at the Brewster
angle ϑB deﬁned by
tan ϑB = nr2/nr1
(4.63)
Total reﬂection also occurs for TM waves with ϑi > ϑc. The penetration depth
dp of the transmitted wave is the same as for TE waves. The phase shift of the

and it is larger than for TE waves. The power transmissivity (transmittance)
T = |t12|2 nr2 cos ϑt

(4.65)
is also different for TE and TM polarization. The correction factor after |t12|2
accounts for the different wave velocities in the normal direction. For normal

(4.67)
which also applies to the more general case with complex refractive index
˜n = nr + ika (see Section 4.2). The extinction coefﬁcient ka is usually very
small in semiconductor waveguides. In contrast, metals have a very large ka and
strongly absorb optical waves. For that reason, Eq. (4.66) results in R ≈1 at metal
interfaces.
Plane wave theory is used, for example, to track multiple reﬂections of light
inside light-emitting diodes and solar cells (ray tracing).

4.6. MULTILAYER STRUCTURES

4.6
Multilayer Structures
With several parallel interfaces, multiple reﬂections occur between the interfaces,
and an inﬁnite series of reﬂected and transmitted waves needs to be considered.
This type of situation is often treated by the transfer matrix method, which shall
be outlined in the following using the simple example of two parallel interfaces
and normal incidence (Fig 4.10). At the ﬁrst interface, the electric ﬁeld on both
sides can be represented by two counterpropagating waves
E1 = E−
1 exp[−ik1xx] + E+
1 exp[+ik1xx]
(4.68)
E2 = E−
2 exp[−ik2xx] + E+

(4.70)
where the coefﬁcients of the transfer matrix ˆT are given by T11 = T22 = t−1
12
and T12 = T21 = r12t−1
12 . The reﬂection coefﬁcient r12 and the transmission
coefﬁcient t12 are deﬁned in Section 4.5. The subsequent transmission through
layer 2 of thickness d can also be described by a transfer matrix equation like
Eq. (4.70) with T11 = exp[ik2xd], T22 = exp[−ik2xd], and T12 = T21 = 0.
This is followed by another reﬂection. The overall transfer matrix of the layer is

obtained by sequential multiplication of all individual transfer matrices. This gives
two equations for the two unknown ﬁeld components E+
1 and E−
3 of reﬂected and
transmitted wave, respectively (E+
3 = 0). The slab reﬂection and transmission
coefﬁcients become, respectively,
r13 = r12 + r23 exp[−i2k2xd]
1 + r12r23 exp[−i2k2xd]
(4.71)
t13 =
t12t23 exp[−ik2xd]
1 + r12r23 exp[−i2k2xd].
(4.72)
These equations also hold for nonnormal incidence with the reﬂectance and
transmittance given by
R = |r13|2
(4.73)
T = |t13|2 nr3 cos ϑ3
nr1 cos ϑ1
,
(4.74)
however, the coefﬁcients rij and tij then have different values for TE and TM
polarization (see Section 4.5). In general, the relations
rij = −rji
(4.75)
tij = tji
(4.76)

are valid at any interface. If layer 2 is absorbing,
k2x = 2π
λ0
(nr2 + ika2) cos ϑ2
(4.78)
with the extinction coefﬁcient ka2 and the absorption coefﬁcient αo2 = 4πka2/λ.
The power absorbance A is given by optical energy conservation:
A = 1 −R −T.
(4.79)
The transfer matrix method can easily be expanded to more than two
interfaces [20, 122].
4.7
Helmholtz Wave Equations
The mathematical treatment of optical waveguides is based on the Helmholtz
equations, which can be directly derived from the Maxwell equations

where ε(⃗r) is a function of the local position. In most semiconductor devices, ε(⃗r)
is almost constant within each epitaxial layer, and it exhibits steplike changes only
at layer boundaries. Thus, within each layer,
∇2⃗E + k2
0ε⃗E = 0
(4.82)
∇2 ⃗H + k2
0ε ⃗H = 0.
(4.83)
These homogeneous Helmholtz equations are typically solved within each homo-
geneous region and the solutions are matched at region interfaces, considering
appropriate boundary conditions. Free-space solutions of the Helmholtz equation
are plane waves (Section 4.4), Gaussian beams (Section 4.12), and spherical waves
(Section 4.13). Each of these solutions applies to different observation ranges
(Fig. 4.11).
For weak guiding, if the differentiation of the two polarization directions is
not important, the vector Helmholtz equations (4.82) and (4.83) can be transferred
into the scalar Helmholtz equation
∇2 + k2
0ε = 0,
(4.84)
where (x, y, z) represents the magnitude of the electrical or the magnetic ﬁeld.
If the propagation direction ⃗k is close to the z axis, the transformation

canbeintroduced,assumingthatT(x, y, z)variesslowlyinthez direction(parax-
ial approximation). T(x, y, z) is called the complex envelope of (x, y, z), it
may represent curved wavefronts as in Gaussian beams (Section 4.12). Neglecting
higher order terms ∂2T/∂z2 and k2T, the paraxial Helmholtz equation
becomes
∂2T
∂x2 + ∂2T
∂y2 −i2k ∂T
∂z
= 0.
(4.86)
If the ﬁeld T(x, y, z) is known at position z, the ﬁeld at the next position z + dz
can be calculated from this equation (beam propagation method BPM [123]).
Analytical solutions to the paraxial wave equation are discussed in Section 4.12.
Finally, with the plane wave approximation  = (x, y) exp[iβz], we obtain
the reduced scalar Helmholtz equation
∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + (k2 −β2) = 0,
(4.87)
where (x, y) represents any transverse ﬁeld component. Solving the scalar
Helmholtz equation is in general much easier and faster than solving the vec-
tor Helmholtz equations. However, their validity in a given device as well as
their boundary conditions need to be observed carefully. Reviews of the various
numerical methods to solve Helmholtz’s equations for optical waveguides are
given in, e.g., [123, 124, 125]. In the following sections, we use simple examples
to provide a general understanding of the resulting optical ﬁelds.
4.8
Symmetric Planar Waveguides
Symmetric planar waveguides are formed by a thin layer (refractive index nr1)
embedded in a cladding material with a slightly lower refractive index, nr2.Aplane
optical wave traveling within the waveguide layer experiences total reﬂection if
⃗k has an angle θ to the waveguide plane that is less than the critical angle θc
deﬁned by
cos θc = sin ϑc = nr2
nr1
.
(4.88)
The bounce angle θ is complementary to the angle of incidence ϑ used in
other sections. With θ < θc, the wave is considered guided. We will ﬁrst employ
the simpliﬁed ray picture in Fig. 4.12 to introduce some general features of
guided waves. Only discrete bounce angles θm (discrete modes) are allowed
for guided waves due to the self-consistency condition that a wave needs to

(4.89)
including a phase shift 2ϕr that accompanies each internal reﬂection. This
Goos–Hänchen phase shift was introduced in Section 4.5 and it is illustrated
in Fig. 4.13. It depends on the bounce angle and on the polarization in such a

(4.90)
For any wavelength λ0, the fundamental mode (m = 0) is always supported.
However, θm rises with longer wavelength and comes closer to the cutoff angle θc,
resulting in weaker guiding. The guided wave is composed of two distinct plane
waves traveling at angles ±θ with the z axis in the y–z plane (Fig. 4.12). The two
wave vectors add up to the propagation constant of the guided wave
βm = kz,m = nr1k0 cos θm.
(4.91)
Since cos θm lies between 1 and cos θc = nr2/nr1, βm lies between nr2k0 and nr1k0
as illustrated in Fig. 4.14. The effective index of each mode is given by
neff,m = βm

with the fundamental mode having the largest propagation constant and the largest
effective index.
Two types of modal polarization are distinguished in planar waveguides:
• TE modes have a transversal electric ﬁeld E0 = Ex (parallel to the wave-
guide plane and normal to the travel direction ⃗k). The magnetic ﬁeld ⃗H is
also perpendicular to ⃗k and has components in the y and z directions.
• TM modes have a transversal magnetic ﬁeld H0 = Hx (parallel to the
waveguide plane and normal to the travel direction ⃗k). The electrical ﬁeld ⃗E
is also perpendicular to ⃗k and has components in the y and z directions.
Let us now evaluate the TE ﬁeld distribution Ex(⃗r) by solving the Helmholtz
equation.3 From the discussion above, Ex(⃗r) can be replaced by Ex(y) exp[iβz],
and the Helmholtz wave equation simpliﬁes to

Besides guided modes, waveguides also exhibit radiative (leaky) modes, which
have smaller propagation constants β < n2k0 and bounce angles θ > θc. These
quasi modes do not experience total reﬂection and they drain energy from the
waveguide; however, they can still propagate inside the waveguide for quite some

distance as the reﬂectivity of the waveguide walls can still be relatively large
[39, 127, 128]. Waveguide bends or facets may lead to an undesired transfer
of optical power from guided modes to radiation modes (see Section 4.10). In
waveguide simulations, the continuous spectrum of the radiation modes is often
artiﬁcially discretized by employing homogenous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions (electric wall or magnetic wall, respectively), sometimes supplemented
by a so-called perfectly matched layer (PML) in order to avoid parasitic reﬂections
from the boundaries [129].

Rectangular Waveguides
Two-dimensional waveguides conﬁne the light in both transverse directions with
thicknesses dy and dx. The principles and the modal structure in each direction are
similar to planar waveguides. Vertical (y) and lateral (x) modes have independent
indexes m and n, respectively. Instead of TE and TM polarization, two similar
cases can be distinguished (Fig. 4.16):
• HEmn modes are dominated by the lateral electric ﬁeld Ex and the vertical
magnetic ﬁeld Hy, and
• EHmn modes are dominated by the lateral magnetic ﬁeld Hx and the vertical
electric ﬁeld Ey

4.9. RECTANGULAR WAVEGUIDES

modes in rectangular waveguides.
All other ﬁeld components are also present, but they are small since the
refractive index difference between core and cladding materials is small. Various
numerical methods for calculating the modal ﬁelds have been developed. An
approximate analytical method has been proposed by Marcatili [130].
Some examples of practical semiconductor waveguides are shown in Fig. 4.17.
In cases like the ridge waveguide, the lateral conﬁnement of the mode is achieved
by changes in the vertical waveguide structure. To calculate guided modes in this
kind of situation, the effective index method is frequently used. This method solves
for the vertical modes in each lateral region and ﬁnds the effective indeces neff ,
which are different for each region. For a given vertical mode, the lateral modes
are calculated based on the lateral steps between the different effective indeces.
The effective index method is surprisingly accurate in determining the modal
propagation constants; however, it tends to overestimate the modal conﬁnement
in the vertical direction and to underestimate the lateral conﬁnement [131].
The optical ﬁeld in different practical waveguide examples is further analyzed
in Chapters 9 (laser diode), 10 (modulator), and 11 (ampliﬁer photodetector).

Facet Reﬂection of Waveguide Modes
The termination of the waveguide at a crystal-air facet results in partial reﬂection
and partial transmission of the guided mode. In plane wave approximation with
perpendicular angle of incidence, the facet reﬂectance is given by the Fresnel
equation (Eq. (4.66)) using the effective modal index neff and the index of air.
However, waveguide modes are not exactly plane waves and facet reﬂection of an
incident mode transfers power into other guided modes as well as into radiative
modes. The total internal ﬁeld is composed of the incident guided mode (order m)
and a superposition of all reﬂected modes (m′). It is here sufﬁcient to consider the
transverse (x, y) components of the electrical and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively,

The sum represents all reﬂected modes including radiation modes [127]. The
normalized power reﬂection coefﬁcient of mode m is given by
Rm = |rmm|2.

Internal mode conversion coefﬁcients can be obtained from the the nondiagonal
elementsofthematrixrmm′.Inaddition,thetransmittedﬁeldoutsidethewaveguide
must be known to establish proper boundary conditions (cf. Section 4.13).
Arigorous treatment of this reﬂection process is rather complicated [132, 133, 134].

The Fresnel value R0 varies slightly with the waveguide thickness due to the
changing effective index (n1 > neff > n2); however, the actual modal reﬂectance
exhibits signiﬁcant deviations.The facet reﬂectivity forTE modes is usually higher

The TM reﬂection coefﬁcient can be obtained from Eq. (4.103).
The common use of low- or high-reﬂection facet coatings further increases
the difﬁculty of precise reﬂectivity computation [137]. Angled facets are utilized
in semiconductor optical ampliﬁers, for instance, to obtain ultra low reﬂectivities
[138].
4.11
Periodic Structures
In order to outline the optical properties of periodic structures, like distributed
feedback (DFB) lasers, we assume that the refractive index varies in the direction
of propagation as
nr(z) = neff + n cos(2πz/)
(4.106)
with the grating period (pitch)  and n ≪neff (Fig. 4.19). Such a grating con-
tinuously reﬂects the incoming wave (distributed feedback). The reﬂected waves
exhibit a constructive phase difference at the Bragg wavelength

ing, which gives the strongest reﬂected wave ( ≈235 nm for 1st order gratings
in InP at λ0 = 1.55 µm).4 The Bragg propagation constant therefore is βB =

consists of two counterpropagating waves that can be approximated as

two equations are coupled through the coupling coefﬁcient κ, which depends on
the shape of the grating. For other than cosine variations of the refractive index,
the function nr(z) can be represented by a Fourier expansion. Taking a rectangular
refractive index proﬁle, for example, the ﬁrst two Fourier terms are
nr(z) = neff + 4
π n cos(2βBz) + . . . ,
(4.115)
leading to the coupling constant κ = 4n/λ0. For gratings that cover only part
of the transverse mode extention, κ is weighted by a conﬁnement factor. For more
details on distributed feedback lasers, the reader is referred to specialized texts
[139, 140].

beam radius W(z) (right).
Figure 4.20 illustrates the Gaussian beam. At z = 0, the beam radius W(z) is min-
imum (waist W0) and the wavefront is planar (curvature radius R(0) = ∞). The
beam waist diameter 2W0 is called spot size. As the beam travels in z direction,
the convex wavefront ﬁrst has a very large radius of curvature (i.e., it is almost
planar), and it later approaches the curvature radius of a spherical wave (R(z) = z
for large z). The largest curvature occurs at z = z0 with the smallest radius
R(z0) = 2z0. The parameter z0 is called Rayleigh range. For large z, the beam
radius increases almost linear with z as the beam approaches the constant
divergence angle
θ0 =

.
(4.121)
The beam divergence is stronger the smaller the beam waist is. On the beam
axis, the phase kz −ζ(z) is that of a plane wave kz corrected by the phase retar-
dation ζ(z), which ranges from −π/2 at z = −∞to +π/2 at z = ∞with
ζ(±z0) = ±π/4. The intensity Iopt = ||2 becomes

About 86% of the power is contained within the beam radius W(z), which marks
1/e2 of the axis intensity. The parameters A0 and z0 are obtained from boundary
conditions.
The Gaussian beam approximation is often used to describe light beam trans-
mission through small optical components for which ray optics fails. Upon
transmission through circularly symmetric components aligned with the beam
axis, the light beam remains a Gaussian beam as long as its paraxial nature is
maintained. The transmission transfers the incoming wavefront curvature R1 and
beam radius W1 into new outgoing values R2 and W2, respectively. Summarizing
both parameters in a complex value

the transmission through an optical component can be described by using ABCD

(4.125)
For rectangular waveguides or other noncircular situations, the x and y direc-
tions can be separated in Eq. (4.116) and treated independently, giving an elliptical
beam shape. This way, the astigmatism of laser diodes can be considered; i.e.,
different waist positions on the z axis for the x and y direction of the beam, respec-
tively [141]. Higher order transverse modes are represented by Hermite–Gaussian
functions as shown schematically in Fig. 4.22. More details on Gaussian beams
can be found, for example, in [126, 142, 143].
4.13
Far Field
Laser diodes and similar devices emit an optical wave from the end of an internal
waveguide into free space. In general, the larger the radiating aperture, the smaller
the far ﬁeld divergence. As shown in Fig. 4.23, the divergence along the axis
perpendicular to the semiconductor layers (so-called fast axis) is usually much
stronger than that along the axis parallel to the layers (slow axis). In some cases,
the beam is astigmatic; i.e., the beam waists for both directions are located at
different positions z [141]. If the ratio between the beam waists and the far ﬁeld

divergences is nearly equal to the corresponding values of a Gaussian beam, the
emitted ﬁeld is called diffraction-limited. Especially the lateral far ﬁeld of broad
area lasers, strongly inﬂuenced by multi-mode behaviour and ﬁlamentation effects,
is much wider than the diffraction limit.

The emitted ﬁeld is obtained by solving the homogeneous Helmholtz equation
for the free-space region [127]. It is closely related to the internal mode reﬂection
as the ﬁelds left and right of the facet need to satisfy the electromagnetic boundary
conditions.Assumingthefacetatz = 0,theelectricﬁeldjustoutsidethewaveguide

radiation ﬁeld far away from the facet and it is given in spherical coordinates
(r, , ) as shown in Fig. 4.24 (cf. Section B.1). For large values of r (typi-
cally r > 5λ0), the following analytical approximation can be obtained for the

This substitution also considers that the apparent emission area changes with the

Photon Generation
In semiconductors, photons are typically generated by electron transitions
from the conduction band to the valence band. This transition can happen
spontaneously or it can be stimulated by another photon. Stimulated photon
emission generates optical gain, which is key to laser diodes and semi-
conductor optical ampliﬁers. This chapter mainly focuses on optical gain.
Spontaneous emission of photons is key to light-emitting diodes, and it is
covered at the end.
5.1
Optical Gain
Optical gain is deﬁned as the growth ratio of light intensity (photon density) per unit
length of light propagation. Like the optical absorption coefﬁcient αo, the optical
gain coefﬁcient g is given in inverse centimeters (1/cm). An incoming photon can
either be absorbed or generate gain. Photon absorption causes the transition of
an electron from a lower to a higher energy band, creating an electron–hole pair.
Gain is generated by stimulated recombination of an existing electron–hole pair,
creating a second photon. The second photon exhibits the same wavelength and
the same phase as the ﬁrst photon, doubling the amplitude of the monochromatic
wave. Subsequent repetition of this process leads to strong light ampliﬁcation.
However, the competing process is the absorption of photons by the generation
of new electron–hole pairs. Stimulated emission prevails when more electrons
are present at the higher energy level (conduction band) than at the lower energy
level (valence band). This inversion of the carrier population can be achieved at
pn-junctions by providing conduction band electrons from the n-doped side and
valence band holes from the p-doped side. At low injection current, band-to-band
absorption still dominates and the optical gain g is below zero.At the transparency
current, both processes are equally strong, the gain is zero, and the material is
transparent. Even stronger current causes net ampliﬁcation of light.
The optical gain is proportional to the probability that a given photon triggers
an electron transition from a higher energy level j to a lower energy level i. The
photon energy hν must be equal to the transition energy Eij = Ej −Ei. The
quantum-mechanical calculation of this probability for semiconductors has been
described in many publications (see, e.g., [10, 20]). To provide a more intuitive
understanding, we skip most of the quantum mechanics here and evaluate the

(5.4)
With higher energy, more and more subbands are added up in calculating the total
gain (cf. Fig. 2.14). Allowed are only vertical transitions within the E(⃗k) diagram
since the electron momentum as well as the electron spin must be the same in the
higher and the lower states (k-selection rule). Additional selection rules apply in
quantum wells, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Only transitions between subbands with
the same quantum number m are allowed. Transitions between subbands with
dissimilar quantum numbers are forbidden transitions. However, valence band
mixing enables forbidden transitions at larger k vectors (see Section 5.1.1).
The Fermi functions fi and fj in Eq. (5.1) give the probability that the energy
levels Ei and Ej, respectively, are occupied by electrons. Maximum gain is
obtained with fj = 1 at the upper level and fi = 0 at the lower level. The
opposite case gives maximum absorption. The Fermi factor (fj −fi) results
from fj(1 −fi) −fi(1 −fj) accounting for stimulated emission and band-to-
band absorption. The stimulated emission rate, for example, is proportional to
the occupation of the higher level (fj) as well as to the chance that the lower
level is empty (1 −fi). Figure 5.2 shows schematically how the gain varies with
photon energy. The lower energy limit of positive gain is set by the reduced den-
sity of states. Maximum gain is reached for fi −fj = 1. However, the Fermi

factor decays with higher energy, and it becomes zero when the energy equals the
quasi-Fermi level distance EF. Band-to-band absorption dominates for higher
photon energies (negative gain). Thus, the gain spectrum is generally limited to
Eg < hν < EF. Compared to the smooth gain spectrum in bulk material, quan-
tum wells are expected to exhibit rather sharp features due to the constant density
of states for each subband (Fig. 5.2). However, real quantum well gain spectra
do not show such sharp features due to transition energy broadening (dephasing),
which is discussed in Section 5.1.2.

5.1.1
Transition Matrix Element
The transition matrix element |M|2 is a measure for the strength of stimulated
electron transitions in a given material. This strength does not depend on the
direction of the interband transition; it is the same for emission and absorption.
However, the transition strength does depend on the angle between the electron
wave vector ⃗k and the optical ﬁeld vector ⃗E. Any polarization direction of the
optical ﬁeld encounters a variety of electron ⃗k vectors that needs to be averaged at
the given photon energy. For bulk zinc blende semiconductors, averaging over all
possible ⃗k vectors results in an isotropic transition matrix element that is equal to
the momentum matrix element introduced in Section 2.2.3,

effective mass (cf. Eq. (2.61)). Electron spin resonance techniques allow for fairly
accurate measurements of the momentum matrix element (Table 5.1).
For quantum well structures, the transition matrix element is anisotropic and
the gain depends on the optical polarization. Commonly, one distinguishes two
polarization modes, in which either the electric ﬁeld (TE mode) or the magnetic
ﬁeld (TM mode) lies within the quantum well xy-plane (transversal plane). The

depends on the photon energy through the quantum well dispersion functions
Em(⃗k). It is different for each subband m. The overlap integral Oij of the two
quantum well envelope wave functions can assume values between 0 and 1.At the
 point, Oij is nonzero only for subbands with the same quantum number m
(allowed transitions). Away from the  point, Oij is nonzero even for forbidden
transitions (see Fig. 5.3). Thus, at higher photon energies, summation over all pos-
sible subband combinations must be included in the gain calculation for quantum
wells.

For both polarization directions, the relative transition strength |M|2/M2
b is
plotted in Fig. 5.3 as a function of the in-plane wave vector kt. We here use the
same GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well as in Fig. 2.15a, which supports two quantum
levels in the conduction band (C1, C2). Heavy-hole transitions are favored under
TE polarization while the light-hole transition is favored for TM polarization. In
the TM case, the light-hole transition C1–LH1 has a larger strength than the heavy-
hole transition C1–HH1 under TE polarization. Both of them are stronger than in
bulk material. Thus, the use of quantum wells enhances the optical gain. Figure 5.3
also shows some of the forbidden transitions (dashed) whose transition strengths
vanish at the  point.
The wurtzite crystal structure, as in GaN-based blue laser diodes, leads to
different formulas for the transition matrix element. The bulk matrix element is
not isotropic anymore and for a quantum well grown in the hexagonal c direction,

5.1.2
Transition Energy Broadening
Electrons and holes frequently interact with other carriers and with phonons,
thereby changing their energy within the (sub)band. Such intraband scatter events
happen about every 0.1 ps, much more often than band-to-band recombination
events. Thus, scattering leads to an uncertainty of the electron energy, which can

128
CHAPTER 5. PHOTON GENERATION
be accounted for by introducing a symmetrical linewidth broadening function L
into the gain formula (Eq. (5.1))
g(hν) =

dEijgij(Eij)L(hν −Eij).
(5.19)
This convolution integral means that gain at the photon energy hν can now receive
contributions from electron transitions with Eij ̸= hν, weighted by L(hν −Eij).
In fact, positive gain is now possible even for photon energies slightly below the
band gap. Commonly, the Lorentzian line shape function,
L(hν −Eij) = 1

is used with the half-width s (Fig. 5.4). This function is based on the assumption
that the occupation probability of an electron state decays proportionally to
exp(−t/τs).TheFouriertransformationofthisexponentialfunctionintotheenergy
domain leads to Eq. (5.20). s is the average of the broadening in the conduction
and in the valence band. The full linewidth 2s is related to the average intraband

For each band, linewidth contributions i from different scattering processes are

2s = 13 meV. Gain spectra with different linewidth parameters are plotted in
Fig. 5.5 for the same 8-nm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well as in previous ﬁgures.
Less broadening gives higher peak gain and better resolution of the quantum
well subband levels. Note that the spectra are now plotted versus the photon
wavelength λ = c0/ν (cf. 5.2). Figure 5.6 plots gain spectra with different carrier

result of the Asada model.

concentrations. With vanishing carrier concentration, the quantum well exhibits
strong band-to-band absorption and the absorption spectrum reﬂects the different
quantum levels. Positive gain is obtained only with considerable carrier injection
into the quantum well.At very high carrier concentrations, transitions between the
second quantum levels start to contribute to the gain.
The linewidth is typically used as ﬁt parameter to ﬁnd agreement with exper-
imental gain spectra. However, the long-wavelength side of measured spectra is
not reproduced very well by using the Lorentzian line shape function. In fact,
the low-energy tail of this function causes unphysical absorption below the band
gap; i.e., for photon wavelengths above the C1–HH1 transition in Fig. 5.5. This
artifact can be avoided by assuming a faster occupation decay rate, resulting in
a narrower line shape, as represented by the Gaussian line shape in Fig. 5.4.
A combination of both these line shape functions seems to be most reasonable
[147].

5.1. OPTICAL GAIN

In general, the scattering time τs reﬂects carrier collisions with other particles,
and it should depend on carrier energy, carrier concentration, and temperature.
Landsberg has suggested an energy-dependent half-width s(Eij) that varies from
a maximum value 0 near the bandedge to 0 at the quasi-Fermi level separation

(5.22)
for Eg ≤Eij ≤EF. This model has been originally developed for bulk material,
and it is only valid for positive gain (0 = 1.2 meV for bulk GaAs). The Landsberg
linewidth model has also been successfully employed to reproduce measured gain
spectra of quantum wells where the broadening is much larger. For GaAs/AlGaAs
wells, 20 = 20 meV (τs = 66 fs) was obtained, as well as 20 = 30 meV
(τs = 43 fs) for InGaAs/InP quantum wells [150, 151].
However, the above models for the transition energy broadening are more
phenomenological and a rigorous approach should consider the electron scat-
tering processes in detail. Asada has developed a model for the Lorentzian line
shape approximation that considers carrier–carrier scattering as well as carrier–
phonon scattering within the conduction and valence bands [152, 153]. The model
assumes parabolic bands, and it includes the screening of the Coulomb potential
by other carriers. The optical dielectric constant εopt and the longitudinal opti-
cal (LO) phonon energy ¯hωLO are used as material parameters (see Tables 4.3
and 5.1). Results for our GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well are plotted in Fig. 5.7 as a
function of carrier concentration and temperature, respectively. Broadening vari-
ations arise from changes in Fermi spreading and screening length. The largest
contributions to the total broadening in our quantum well result from hole–hole
and hole–LO phonon scattering within the valence band. Electron–hole scattering
dominates in the conduction band. The total scattering time decreases with higher
temperature and with lower carrier concentration. At room temperature and with
n = p = 5 × 1018 cm−3, the scattering time is 87 fs. Thus, for our GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum well, the Asada gain spectrum (dotted in Fig. 5.5) is close to the spec-
trum with a constant Lorentz scattering time of τs = 100 fs. More advanced models
including asymmetric line shape functions are described in [153].
5.1.3
Strain Effects
The application of strain leads to a deformation of the band structure as outlined in
Section 2.2. The thickness of the strained layer is typically only a few nanometers
and it must be below the critical thickness to prevent lattice relaxation [6]. Stained
quantum wells are widely utilized in optoelectronics as they allow for improve-
ments of material properties like the optical gain [154]. Commonly, strain is

generated by varying the materials composition so that the lattice constant slightly
deviates from that of the substrate. However, to observe pure strain effects, we here
apply strain to our GaAs quantum well without changing the composition. For the
sake of simplicity, the AlGaAs barrier layers remain unstrained and the carrier
concentration is kept constant. Figure 5.8 shows gain variations calculated for
this theoretical example. The TM gain increases dramatically with tensile strain,
whereas it almost disappears for compressive strain. The TE gain is improved
in both cases. Even with our small amount of 1% strain, the transition energy
changes signiﬁcantly. In many practical applications, this wavelength shift needs
to be compensated for by changing the layer composition.
To guide our understanding of these gain variations, the corresponding valence
band structures and transition strengths are plotted in Fig. 5.9. The lower boundary
gives the constant position of theAlGaAs valence band edge. Compression slightly
lowers the HH band edge, and it moves the LH band edge below the barrier edge.

134
CHAPTER 5. PHOTON GENERATION
Thus, only heavy holes “see” a quantum well in this case. However, this band edge
variation with compression seems to contradict the tendency given in Fig. 2.9,
which suggests a deeper well. Indeed, at 1% compression, the model-solid theory
predicts a quantum well that is 118 meV deep for heavy holes and 50 meV deep for
light holes (cf. Section 2.5). This prediction is not in agreement with experimental
results for the AlAs/GaAs valence band offset [155]. As an alternative approach,
we here use the assumption of a constant band offset ratio Ev/Eg = 0.35 for
small strain. Since the band gap Eg increases with compression, the band offset
Ev slightly shrinks as shown in Fig. 5.9. The elimination of the LH1 subband
leaves more carriers for the C1–HH1 transition so that the TE peak gain is higher
than in the unstrained case. Without light holes, the TM gain vanishes. With tensile
strain, the light-hole band is on top (cf. Fig. 2.9). The lower band gap now gives
a deeper quantum well for light holes. Due to the more shallow HH quantum
well, the C1–LH1 transition is enhanced, which results in substantial TM gain
improvement. However, this transition also contributes to TE gain, as well as the
C1–HH1 transition. Both transition energies are visible in the TE gain spectrum

of Fig. 5.8. As illustrated in this example, gain improvements in strained quantum
wells mainly result from the increased separation of LH and HH subbands. Strain
effects on device performance are further discussed in Chapters 9 and 10.
5.1.4
Many-Body Effects
Broadening effects due to scattering are only one example for the inﬂuence of
carrier–carrier interaction on the gain. The screening of the electron Coulomb
potential by surrounding carriers reduces the repulsion between valence and con-
duction band electrons and, among other factors, leads to a band gap reduction
(cf. Section 2.1.3).
Another important many-body effect is the Coulomb enhancement of the
gain due to mutual attraction of electrons and holes. For our GaAs quantum
well, Coulomb enhancement effects on the gain are shown in Fig. 5.10 as
Figure 5.10: Gain spectra with (solid) and without (dashed) Coulomb enhance-
ment, calculated for our 8-nm-thick GaAs/Al0.15Ga0.85As quantum well at TE and
TM polarization with the carrier concentration given as a parameter (1018 cm−3).
The band gap reduction is neglected here.

136
CHAPTER 5. PHOTON GENERATION
calculated following the model in [156]. The blue-shift of the gain peak with
rising carrier concentration is typically stronger than the red-shift from band gap
renormalization.
Arigorous many-body theory of the gain including carrier collisions (Coulomb
correlation) leads to a further enhancement and a blue-shift of the gain peak at high
carrier concentrations. A thorough consideration of those many-body effects can
be found elsewhere [10].
At low temperatures or low carrier concentrations, an electron–hole pair can
form a hydrogen-like bond. This so-called exciton gives sharp absorption peaks
below the band gap of quantum wells, which are sensitive to the electric ﬁeld
[157]. However, due to screening, excitons usually disappear at the high carrier
concentrations required for lasing.
5.1.5
Gain Suppression
Conventionally, the optical gain is considered independent of the photon density
(linear gain). However, the optical gain tends to decrease at high photon densities S
(gain suppression). This nonlinear gain effect is partially caused by the depletion of
electrons at certain energy levels due to strong stimulated recombination (spectral
hole burning). Gain suppression is commonly approximated as
g =
g0
1 + ϵS ,
(5.23)
where the nonlinear gain suppression coefﬁcient ϵ is typically on the order of
10−17 cm3. In the case of multiple modes, the photon density S is the sum of the
densities of all the modes.
5.2
Spontaneous Emission
The total spontaneous emission rate in bulk material is often approximated
by Eq. (3.34) using the bimolecular recombination coefﬁcient B. This simple
equation represents the full spectrum of photons generated by spontaneous band-
to-band recombination processes.The spontaneous emission spectrum itself can be
given as

(5.24)
and it is closely related to the gain spectrum in Eq. (5.1). In the case of quantum
wells, all subbands need to be included. The transition strength |Mb|2 is now
averaged over all polarization directions. The emission rate is proportional to the

photon states Dopt. For large optical cavities, the density of photon states becomes
Dopt(hν) =
εnr
π2¯h3c3 (hν)2.
(5.25)
The Fermi factor fc(1 −fv) gives the probability that the conduction band level
is occupied and the valence band level is empty at the same time. It is different
from the Fermi factor fc −fv of the gain. Figure 5.11 illustrates the effect of the
different Fermi factors on gain and spontaneous emission. The spontaneous emis-
sion spectrum peaks at higher photon energy, and it extends beyond hν = EF.
The ﬁnal spontaneous emission spectrum rspon(hν) is obtained by including
the transition energy broadening analogue to Eq. (5.19). This spectrum can be

τs = 0.5 ps.
Figure 5.12 plots spontaneous emission spectra for our GaAs quantum well.
As carrier inversion is not required here, spontaneous emission is present at all
carrier concentrations. Transition energy broadening smoothens the spontaneous
emission spectrum, and the scattering time τs can be extracted from measurements.
The spontaneous emission spectrum is easier to measure than the gain spectrum,
and it is often used for quantum well characterization. However, carrier concentra-
tions are small and usually not exactly known in these measurements, generating
some uncertainty in the extraction of broadening parameters.
Broadening does not affect the total spontaneous recombination rate, which is
obtained by integration over all photon energies
Rspon =

dE rsp(E).
(5.28)
This integral is more accurate than Eq. (3.34), and it also applies to quantum
wells.

This chapter introduces the heat ﬂux equation, as well as typical heat sources
in semiconductor optoelectronic devices. For various semiconductors, the

semiconductor alloys are given.

Heat Flux Equation
Self-heating often limits the performance of optoelectronic devices. Heat is gener-
ated when carriers transfer part of their energy to the crystal lattice. In consequence,

in its temperature, TL. In this chapter, we assume a local thermal equilibrium
between lattice and carriers with T = TL = Tn = Tp (cf. Section 3.9.1). Virtually
all material properties like energy band gap and carrier mobility change with rising
temperature.Within the crystal lattice, thermal energy is dissipated by traveling lat-
tice vibrations. The smallest energy portions of lattice waves are called phonons,
which can be treated like particles. Microscopic theories of lattice heat genera-
tion and dissipation are based on the phonon picture outlined in many solid-state
textbooks, e.g., [46, 103, 158].
In practical device simulation, the main thermal parameters are thermal con-
ductivity κL and speciﬁc heat CL of the crystal lattice (Table 6.1). Electrons and
holes also contribute to speciﬁc heat and thermal conductivity (cf. Section 3.9.1).
However, those contributions are usually less than 1% of the total values [159]

6.2. HEAT GENERATION
145
6.2
Heat Generation
Lattice heat is generated whenever physical processes transfer energy to the crystal
lattice. According to differences in transfer mechanisms, heat sources can be sep-
arated into Joule heat, electron–hole recombination heat, Thomson heat, and heat
from optical absorption. Here, we discuss these terms for the steady-state case, a
more general discussion can be found in [159].
6.2.1
Joule Heat
The ﬂow of carriers through a semiconductor is accompanied by frequent car-
rier scattering by phonons, leading to a continuing energy loss to the lattice.
Carriers move from a higher electrostatic potential to a lower potential, and the
corresponding energy difference is typically absorbed by the lattice as Joule heat
HJ =
⃗j2
n

⃗j2

(6.10)
which is proportional to the electrical resistance of the material (cf. Fig. 3.17c).The
current density can be expressed by the slope of the quasi-Fermi levels, leading to
the equivalent equation
HJ = −1
q (⃗jn∇EFn + ⃗jp∇EFp).
(6.11)
6.2.2
Recombination Heat
When an electron–hole pair recombines, the energy is either transferred to a photon
(light) or to a phonon (heat). The average heat released is proportional to the
difference between the quasi-Fermi levels
HR = R (EFn −EFp).
(6.12)
Besides defect recombination, the recombination rate R = RSRH + RAug also
includesAuger recombination since the hot carriers generated duringAuger recom-
bination eventually lose their energy to phonons (cf. Fig. 3.10). Note that R is the
net recombination rate, including thermal generation of carriers.
Spontaneous recombination may be included here since most of the pho-
tons emitted are absorbed by the semiconductor and eventually converted into
heat. Stimulated emission of photons also leads to some heat generation as those
photons are partially absorbed inside the device. However, heat generation from
photon absorption is spread throughout the device and should better be treated in
combination with optical calculations (Section 6.2.4).

146
CHAPTER 6. HEAT GENERATION AND DISSIPATION
Electron–hole recombination also causes a cooling of carriers above the Fermi
level, which ﬁll the now empty spots at the Fermi level. This contribution is
related to the thermoelectric power Pp and Pn of holes and electrons, respectively,
(cf. Section 3.9.1)
HP = qRT (Pp −Pn).
(6.13)
T qPn and T qPp are the average excess energies of carriers above the quasi-
Fermi level. The excess energy is not unlikely to exceed the recombination energy
EFn −EFp [159].
6.2.3
Thomson Heat
The thermoelectric power (V/K) is a measure for the increase in average carrier
excess energy with increasing temperature. It varies with the density of states, car-
rier concentration, and temperature (cf. Eqs. (3.72) and (3.73)). So-calledThomson
heat is transferred between carriers and lattice as current ﬂows along a gradient of
the thermoelectric power
HT = −qT (⃗jn∇Pn + ⃗jp∇Pp).
(6.14)
Adramatic example is the interface between different semiconductors.When enter-
ing a material with a lower conduction band edge, electrons suddenly exhibit
excess kinetic energy (hot electrons) that is eventually dissipated to the lattice
(cf. Fig 3.17d). In the opposite direction, electrons need to receive extra energy
from the lattice to leave the quantum well. Therefore, Thomson heat can be posi-
tive or negative (cooling). Due to its close relation to the Peltier effect, Thomson
heat is also referred to as Peltier heat (cf. Section 3.9.1).
6.2.4
Optical Absorption Heat
When optical waves penetrate a material, their energy can be partially or fully
absorbed. The magnitude and the mechanism of absorption depends on the photon
energy hν (cf. Section 4.2.1).At low photon energies, the light is directly absorbed
by the crystal lattice (reststrahlen region). At typical photon energies, absorption
by free carriers dominates, which quickly dissipates the energy to the lattice due
to very short intraband scattering times. Band-to-band absorption results in new
electron–hole pairs (photon recycling), which may or may not generate heat by
one of the above mechanisms. Corresponding to the overall device model, band-
to-band absorption may be excluded as a direct heat source.
Using the appropriate optical absorption coefﬁcient αo(hν), the absorption-
related heat power density can simply be given as
HA = αoph hν
(6.15)

6.3. THERMAL RESISTANCE
147
with the photon ﬂux density ph from Eq. (4.49). This formula is based on the
assumption that electrons, if involved, transfer their absorption energy to the lattice
without traveling.
6.3
Thermal Resistance
In practical device design, the internal temperature often needs to be known only in
speciﬁc locations, e.g., within the active region of a laser diode. If the heat power
Pheat (W) is generated in the same location, then the heat ﬂux from that location
to the heat sink can be characterized by a thermal resistance Rth (K/W), giving the
temperature difference
	T = RthPheat
(6.16)
between heat source and heat sink. Similar to the electrical resistance, the thermal
resistance depends not only on material properties (thermal conductivity) but also
on the device geometry.
The advantage of this approach is the thermal characterization of the device by
one parameter Rth that usually can be measured. In cases with heat generation at
different locations within the device, the single resistance Rth can be replaced by
a thermal resistance network. In analogy to electrical circuits, simpliﬁed thermal
models can be established this way. Thermal resistances are also employed to
account for the heat ﬂux outside the simulated device region (cf. Section 9.4).
6.4
Boundary Conditions
Similar to Section 3.5, three types of thermal boundary conditions are distinguished
for the heat ﬂux equation: Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed conditions.The Dirichlet
type simply speciﬁes the temperature Tb at the boundary, and it is appropriate for
device mounting onto a heat sink with small thermal resistance:
Tb = Tsink
(6.17)
with Tsink representing the ambient temperature.With larger external thermal resis-
tance Rsink
th , the heat sink temperature Tsink becomes a function of the heat power.
In this case, the mixed boundary condition for the surface-normal heat ﬂux applies
⃗ν ⃗Jheat = Tb −Text

with the thermal contact area Ath and the external temperature Text on the other
side of the heat sink. This boundary condition considers an unknown but uniform

CHAPTER 6. HEAT GENERATION AND DISSIPATION
boundary temperature Tb. The boundary temperature becomes nonuniform with
small simulated device regions or with similar thermal conductivities on both sides
of the boundary. In that case, external regions must be included in the heat ﬂux
equation.
Asimilar boundary condition is used to describe convective heat removal from
the device surface by moving air or liquids
⃗ν ⃗Jheat = hcTb −Text
(6.19)
with the heat transfer coefﬁcient hc. For free convection of air, hc = 6 . . .
30Wm−2 K−1. Forced convection or liquids exhibit much higher coefﬁcients.
However, convective heat transfer is often negligible with optoelectronic devices
since surface heating and surface area are relatively small. Radiative heat transfer
is even less important.
Thus, most boundaries of a typical device exhibit negligible heat ﬂux, which
is described by the Neumann condition
⃗ν ⃗Jheat = 0.
(6.20)
This is often the default thermal boundary condition in device simulation software.
It applies to symmetry planes as well as to interfaces with air or vacuum.
Practical examples of self-heating are analyzed in Chapters 8 and 9 for vertical
cavity lasers and GaN-based light emitters, respectively.

Chapter 7
Edge-Emitting Laser
This chapter gives an introduction to laser diodes, and it analyzes the physical
mechanisms behind two key performance parameters: threshold current and
slopeefﬁciency.AcommonInP-basedmultiquantumwelllaserdiodeisusedas
example, and laser measurements are employed to calibrate material param-
eters in the simulation. The two-dimensional laser model self-consistently
combines gain calculations with a drift–diffusion model and optical wave-
guide simulations. Degrading effects of ambient temperature elevation on the
laser performance are investigated. Internal physical processes that are hardly
accessible by experiments or by simple laser models are revealed.
7.1
Introduction
Traveling through a semiconductor, a single photon is able to generate an identical
second photon by stimulating the recombination of an electron–hole pair. This
photon multiplication is the key physical mechanism of lasing. The second photon
exhibits the same wavelength and the same phase as the ﬁrst photon, doubling
the amplitude of their monochromatic wave. Subsequent repetition of this process
leads to strong light ampliﬁcation. However, the competing process is the absorp-
tion of photons by the generation of new electron–hole pairs. Stimulated emission
prevails when more electrons are present at the conduction band level than at the
valence band level (cf. Chap. 5). This carrier inversion is the ﬁrst requirement of
lasing and it is achieved at pn-junctions by providing conduction band electrons
from the n-doped side and valence band holes from the p-doped side (Fig. 7.1).
The photon energy is given by the band gap, which depends on the semiconductor
material. Continuous current injection into the device leads to continuous stimu-
lated emission of photons, but only if enough photons are constantly present in
the device to trigger this process. Therefore, optical feedback and the conﬁnement
of photons in an optical resonator is the second basic requirement of lasing. In a
Fabry–Perot laser, two reﬂecting facets at both ends of the optical waveguide are
used for optical feedback (laser length L, facet power reﬂectivities R1, R2). The
photon round trip gain is given by
Grt = R1R2 exp[(og −αi)L] = exp[(og −αi −αm)L].

The quantum well gain g rises with increasing concentration of electrons and holes.
The volume of the optical mode Vm is typically much larger than the active layer
volume Va; their ratio is given by the optical conﬁnement factor
o = Va

(7.2)
For lasing, the modal gain og needs to compensate for internal optical loss αi
and mirror loss αm. Lasing threshold is reached at Grt = 1 with the threshold gain
ogth = αi + αm.
(7.3)
Figure 7.1 illustrates the injection of electrons and holes into a multiquantum
well (MQW) active region as well as different recombination processes. Crystal
defects (SRH, Shockley–Read–Hall recombination) and the Auger process cause
nonradiative recombination. Photons are generated by spontaneous and by stimu-
lated recombination. Carriers may also leak out of the separate conﬁnement layer
(SCL). Vertical leakage is typically dominated by electrons and lateral leakage by
ambipolar carrier diffusion within the quantum wells (Fig. 7.2). Carriers leaving
the ridge waveguide region (gray area in Fig. 7.2) eventually recombine; however,
they are considered leakage carriers in our analysis. Recombination mechanisms
inside the waveguide region plus both the leakage currents add up to the total

are considered lost carriers.The threshold current Ith compensates for all the carrier

from both facets. In the case of a symmetrical Fabry–Perot laser, both facets emit
the same power. The slope efﬁciency dP/dI is proportional to the differential
quantum efﬁciency ηd. It depends on the internal optical loss αi, on the mirror loss

(7.6)
which gives the fraction of the total current increment I that results in stimulated
emission of photons. The parameter ηi is less than unity if parts of I are
consumed by other recombination processes (Ir) or by leakage (Iv, Il). The
corresponding differential efﬁciencies are given as

These efﬁciencies can also be understood as probabilities. An additional electron
injected above the threshold has the probability ηl of remaining within the ridge
region. It has the probability ηlηv of recombining within the waveguide region.
The efﬁciency ηr gives the ratio of the stimulated recombination increment to the
total recombination increment within the waveguide region (including the MQW).
These contributions to the slope efﬁciency will be further analyzed in Sections 7.4
and 7.5.

with 1.55 µm emission wavelength. The 5.5-nm-thick barriers exhibit slight ten-
sile strain (0.04%). The ﬁrst and last barriers are 17 nm wide. The MQW stack
is sandwiched between undoped InGaAsP separate conﬁnement layers (SCLs),
which act as a waveguide. On the p-side of the structure, the ﬁrst 140 nm of the
InP cladding layer are not intentionally doped and the remainder is Zn doped. The
width of the p-InP ridge is 57 µm. Facet cleaving gives Fabry–Perot resonators
with different cavity lengths L. Measured light–current characteristics are shown
in Figs. 7.3 and 7.4.
7.2
Models and Material Parameters
Laser diodes represent a complex interaction of electronic, thermal, and optical
processes. We here employ the PICS3D software package, which self-consistently
combines carrier transport, heat ﬂux, optical gain computation, and wave guiding.
However, the model includes many material parameters that are not exactly known.
Critical parameters need to be calibrated using measured laser characteristics
as explained in the following paragraphs. Such a calibration procedure is of

7.2. MODELS AND MATERIAL PARAMETERS
157
paramount importance for drawing realistic conclusions from the simulation.
Simultaneous reproduction of several measurements is often necessary for ana-
lyzing the relative importance of different physical mechanisms. For example,
agreement with the measured threshold current is obtained by ﬁtting the Auger
recombination parameter or by ﬁtting the absorption coefﬁcient. The correct bal-
ance between both mechanisms can be found by simultaneous reproduction of the
measured slope efﬁciency. However, the number of uncertain material parame-
ters should be kept as small as possible by simplifying the experimental situation
simulated. Laser operation with very short current pulses, for instance, avoids self-
heating of the device, and it makes it possible to exclude heat ﬂux from the model.
We here use pulsed LI characteristics measured at different laser lengths (Fig. 7.3)
[163] and at different ambient temperatures (Fig. 7.4) [164].
7.2.1
Drift–Diffusion Model
The drift–diffusion model of carrier transport includes Fermi statistics and
thermionic emission at heterobarriers. This process is mainly controlled by the off-
set of the conduction band (Ec) and the valence band (Ev) at the heterobarrier
(Eg = 1.35 −0.775y + 0.149y2 (eV) for In1−xGaxAsyP1−y lattice matched
to InP with x = 0.1886/(0.4192 −0.0141y)). We ﬁnd best agreement with
high-temperature LI measurements by using a band offset ratio of Ec/Ev =
0.4/0.6, which is typical for the InGaAsP/InP system (cf. Section 2.5). In this
steady-state analysis, carrier transitions between conﬁned and unconﬁned quan-
tum well states are not treated explicitly. Bulk carriers are assumed to ﬁll up the
quantum states without delay, leading to single quasi-Fermi levels. Dynamic laser
modeling considers characteristic delay times for such transitions [165].
Lateral leakage is small in our broad-area laser. LI and current–voltage mea-
surements at different ridge widths can be used to identify lateral leakage [166]
and to calibrate critical parameters like the hole mobility [167]. Within passive
layers, a spontaneous emission parameter of B = 10−10 cm3s−1 is assumed. The
spontaneous recombination rate in quantum wells is much larger than in passive
layers, and it is calculated self-consistently from energy band structure and Fermi
distribution including temperature effects (cf. Section 5.2). Typical numbers are
assumed for the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination lifetime of electrons
and holes with 20 ns inside the active region and 100 ns elsewhere. Due to the
small quantum well band gap, Auger recombination causes the strongest carrier
losses in long-wavelength lasers. Various theoretical and experimental investi-
gations of this mechanism have been published [168, 169, 170]. By deﬁnition,
the experimental Auger parameter C is somewhat different from the theoretical
parameters Cn and Cp used in calculations of the local Auger recombination rate
(Cnn + Cpp)(np −n2
i ) (cf. Section 3.7). For our type of laser with dominating
valence band Auger recombination (Cn = 0), measured temperature effects can

(7.9)
with an activation energy of Ea = 60 meV [170]. Our ﬁt to experimental LI
characteristics leads to an Auger parameter of Cp = 1.6 × 10−28 cm6s−1 at room
temperature (Fig. 7.4).
7.2.2
Gain Model
For our strained quantum wells, the conduction bands are assumed to be parabolic
and the nonparabolic valence bands are computed by the two-band ⃗k · ⃗p method
including valence band mixing (cf. Section 2.2.1). The local optical gain is cal-
culated self-consistently from the local Fermi distribution of carriers at each bias
point of the LI curve. A Lorentzian broadening function is used with 0.1 ps intra-
band scattering time. Band gap renormalization due to carrier–carrier interaction
is considered as
Eg = −ξ
n + p
2
1/3
(7.10)
with ξ = 10−8 eVcm. The thermal band gap shrinkage parameter dEg/dT =
−0.28 meV/K is extracted from the measured thermal shift of the lasing wave-
length. Temperature effects on the calculated quantum well gain are shown in
Figs. 7.5 and 7.6, including intervalence band absorption (see below).The red-shift
of the gain peak wavelength with higher temperature is attributed to the shrink-
ing band gap. The peak gain decreases substantially due to the wider spreading
of the Fermi distribution of carriers. To maintain the required threshold gain with
rising temperature, carrier concentration and injection current need to be increased.
Section 7.5 shows that this mechanism triggers the strong temperature sensitivity
of the threshold current.
7.2.3
Optical Model
The refractive index proﬁle of our structure is listed in Table 7.1 and plotted
in Fig. 7.7 together with the optical intensity. The optical conﬁnement factor is
o = 0.074. The local absorption coefﬁcient is proportional to the concentration
of electrons and holes
αo = αb + knn + kpp .
(7.11)
The constant background loss coefﬁcient αb represents carrier-concentration inde-
pendent mechanisms like photon scattering at defects. Free-carrier absorption

due to electrons is known to be very small in 1.55-µm InGaAsP/InP lasers
(kn ≈10−18 cm2) [74]. Intervalenceband absorption (IVBA) is usually con-
sidered the dominant absorption mechanism in 1.55-µm lasers. It is roughly
proportionaltotheholeconcentration.Absorptionmeasurementsat1.55 µmwave-
length give kp = 20 . . . 60 × 10−18 cm2 for bulk material (InGaAsP exhibits
higher values than InP) [171, 172, 173]. It is difﬁcult to accurately measure
this parameter within quantum wells and only few experimental investigations
of kp can be found in the literature on 1.55-µm MQW structures [173, 174].
IVBA is often believed to weaken with compressive strain but some investiga-
tions suggest otherwise [175, 176]. Our ﬁt to LI measurements at different cavity
lengths gives kp = 82 × 10−18 cm2 (Fig. 7.3). This number is smaller than that
measured with unstrained quantum wells (140 × 10−18 cm2) and larger than that
with more strongly strained quantum wells (35 × 10−18 cm2 with 1.2% strain)
[173]. However, using kp as a ﬁtted parameter helps to compensate for any inac-
curacy of the gain calculation. Both IVBAand band-to-band transitions contribute
to the net quantum well gain given in Figs. 7.5 and 7.6.
The internal modal absorption coefﬁcient αi is obtained by spatial integration
of the local absorption αo, weighted by the optical intensity. Alternatively, αi
could also be used as a ﬁtted parameter without detailed absorption assessment for
each layer. However, this simple approach would not reﬂect temperature effects on
αi(T), which are related to the local carrier concentration (see Section 7.5). For our
lasers, vanishing background loss (αb = 0) and R = 0.28 facet power reﬂectance

The mirror loss coefﬁcient is αm = 47 cm−1 for a cavity length of L = 269 µm.
7.3
Cavity Length Effects on Loss Parameters

measured at different cavity length L. Plotting the inverse slope efﬁciency as
1
ηd

ηi

−2αi


(7.12)
delivers αi and ηi by linear regression of measured data. This widely used linear
method is based on the assumption that ηi and αi do not change with the laser
length. This assumption is questionable for the following reasons.
Especially in long-wavelength lasers, absorption is mainly caused by free car-
riers (intraband transitions) and by intervalence band absorption. In both cases,
the absorption coefﬁcient rises proportionally to the carrier concentration. The
injection efﬁciency ηi is inﬂuenced by the lateral spreading of carriers, carrier
escape from the active region, and recombination losses within the active layers,
which all depend on the carrier concentration. The mirror loss coefﬁcient αm rises
with a shorter cavity length, requiring higher gain and more carriers in the quantum
well. The higher carrier concentration causes the internal absorption to increase
and the differential internal efﬁciency to decrease.
The functions αi(L) and ηi(L) are hard to extract experimentally but they can
be obtained from our simulation (Fig. 7.8). Based on the good agreement with the
measurements (Fig. 7.3), we ﬁrst use Eq. (7.12) to extract both parameters from LI
characteristics simulated with different laser lengths. This results in αi = 14 cm−1
and ηi = 0.67. Secondly, we extract the actual functions αi(L) and ηi(L) as
follows. The internal absorption coefﬁcient is obtained by spatial integration of
the local absorption weighted by the optical intensity. As expected, the internal
loss increases with shorter lasers. For comparison, the result of the linear method
is shown as dotted line in Fig. 7.8, and it is only slightly smaller than the actual
internal loss in long lasers. However, the linear method underestimates the actual
absorption in short lasers substantially. The error is about 30% for our lasers with
L = 269 µm. The injection efﬁciency is extracted by spatial integration of the
stimulated recombination rate at two different bias points above the threshold. For
long lasers, the resulting function ηi(L) is slightly above the linear result in Fig. 7.8.
The efﬁciency ηi(L) drops signiﬁcantly with a shorter cavity length; however, it
is close to the linear result for our lasers with L = 269 µm. In summary, the linear
method used in experiments is not accurate for short lasers.

a function of laser length (solid lines). Dotted lines give the result of the linear
method used in experiments.
7.4
Slope Efﬁciency Limitations
The slope efﬁciency is one of the most important performance parameters of laser
diodes. It gives the percentage of electrons injected above the threshold that con-
tributes photons to the emitted laser beam. This efﬁciency is restricted by carrier
losses (ηi) and by photon losses (αi). The injection efﬁciency ηi is equal to the
fraction of current above the threshold that results in stimulated emission of pho-
tons. Low injection efﬁciency ηi is usually attributed to vertical electron leakage,
which is known to escalate at higher temperatures. Additional electron stopper
layers introducing a barrier in the conduction band have been used successfully
to enhance the high-temperature performance of long-wavelength lasers [177].
For our MQW laser, ηi = 67% is measured at room temperature, which suggests
strong electron leakage. Thus, a second laser structure with an additional InGaP
electron stopper layer between SCL and p-InP was fabricated [162]. The stopper
layer has a conduction band offset to InP of Ec ≈50 meV but it does not hinder
hole transport. However, no signiﬁcant change in the laser characteristics is mea-
sured at room temperature, indicating negligible vertical leakage [162]. Since both
ηv and ηl are close to 100% in these broad-area lasers, the attention is drawn to
recombination losses (ηr) to account for the reduced internal efﬁciency measured
(cf. Eq. (7.7)). Commonly, the quantum well carrier concentration is considered
constant above the threshold leading to ηr = 100% (Fermi level pinning) [39].

7.4. SLOPE EFFICIENCY LIMITATIONS
163
Figure 7.9: Contribution of carrier losses to the total current at threshold and at
27 mW output power (T = 20◦C, L = 269 µm).
This phenomenon is analyzed by evaluating carrier loss mechanisms in our
laser simulation at room temperature (Fig. 7.9). Electron leakage from the active
region can be identiﬁed as minority carrier current in the p-InP cladding layer. At
threshold, far less than 1% of the total electron current leaks into the p-cladding;
i.e., adding an InGaP barrier cannot have any signiﬁcant effect at room temper-
ature. Hole leakage is even smaller. Lateral leakage accounts for about 8% of
the threshold current. Carrier losses due to Auger recombination, spontaneous
emission, and defect recombination are analyzed by integrating the recombina-
tion rates at different bias points. At threshold, 61% of the total current feeds
Auger recombination, 27% spontaneous emission, and 3% defect recombination.
Figure 7.9 shows that all those carrier losses grow above the threshold.This growth
contradicts the common belief that the quantum well carrier concentration does
not change above the threshold [39]. However, even with constant total carrier
number, the carrier distribution among the quantum wells changes with increasing
bias [163]. In our MQW, electrons can move more easily across the MQW than
holes so that p-side quantum wells are occupied by more carriers than n-side
quantum wells. This trend is enhanced with rising bias. Figure 7.10 illustrates the
effects on Auger recombination. The increment of Auger recombination within
the more populated p-side quantum wells is larger than the decrement in the less
populated n-side quantum wells. Auger recombination and spontaneous emission
exhibit a superlinear dependence on the local carrier concentration, and increasing
carrier nonuniformity causes stronger total recombination. SRH recombination

grows linearly with the local carrier concentration, and it reﬂects the change in
average carrier concentration. The net increase of recombination losses results in
ηr = 74% for our device. Using Eq. (7.8), we extract the leakage contributions
ηv = 99% and ηl = 93%. The total injection efﬁciency ηi = 68% is very close to
the measured number, and it is dominated by recombination losses.
7.5
Temperature Effects on Laser Performance
The performance of long-wavelength InGaAsP/InP laser diodes is known to be
strongly temperature dependent. Self-heating or ambient temperature elevation
causes the threshold current to increase and the slope efﬁciency to decrease.
The physical mechanisms dominating the temperature sensitivity are still under
discussion. In recent years, this discussion includes Auger recombination [178],
IVBA [167], thermionic carrier emission out of the active region [179], lateral
carrier spreading [180], passive layer absorption [181], spontaneous recombina-
tion within passive layers [182], and optical gain reductions [168, 183]. All of
these mechanisms should be considered simultaneously in the analysis of mea-
surements. One-sided models lead to one-sided interpretations of experiments and
contribute to the controversy in this ﬁeld. We here demonstrate the analysis of
temperature effects by considering all of the above physical mechanisms and their
self-consistent interaction.

7.5. TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON LASER PERFORMANCE
165
Figure 7.11: Pulsed threshold current and its components as a function of the
ambient temperature (dots, measurement; lines, simulation).
Figure 7.11 plots the calculated threshold current and its components as a func-
tion of temperature. All recombination currents are obtained by spatial integration
over the waveguide region (cf. Fig. 7.2). Carriers leaving the waveguide region
in a lateral or vertical direction constitute leakage currents. At lower temper-
atures, the strongest contribution to the threshold current comes from Auger
recombination, followed by spontaneous emission, lateral leakage current, and
SRH recombination. Vertical carrier leakage is negligible at room temperature
but it increases strongly and becomes the dominant carrier loss mechanism above
120◦C. Thus, the temperature sensitivity of the threshold current is dominated
by Auger recombination at lower temperatures and by vertical leakage at higher
temperatures.
The escalation of carrier losses with higher temperature is related to the
increasing carrier concentration (Fig. 7.12), which is mainly triggered by the
gain reduction with higher temperature. This becomes clear from Fig. 7.13.
With constant gain, the temperature sensitivity of the threshold current would
be very small, despite Auger recombination. Thus, the reduced gain is the trigger
mechanism for increasing carrier losses. Figure 7.13 also shows the effects of
other model variations. ExcludingAuger recombination reduces both the threshold
current and its temperature sensitivity substantially. Including an electron stopper
layer affects the threshold current only at high temperatures, when vertical leakage
becomes relevant [162].

ture (ηd, differential quantum efﬁciency; ηi, injection efﬁciency; ηl, lateral leakage

dots, measurements; lines, simulation).
Components of the slope efﬁciency are plotted in Fig. 7.14 as a function of
temperature (cf. Section 7.1). At room temperature, the injection efﬁciency ηi is
dominated by recombination (ηr). Electron leakage is of minor importance.Above
80◦C, vertical electron leakage causes the highest differential carrier loss (ηv).
The recombination loss increment Ir rises little with higher temperature. This
is related to the more uniform hole distribution, which compensates for enhanced
Auger recombination. Due to a lower carrier mobility, lateral leakage (ηl) decreases
slightly, thereby reducing the temperature sensitivity of the slope efﬁciency, as
observed in [166].
Finally, we analyze temperature effects on the internal optical loss αi(T ).
Absorption is governed by the concentration of holes, which is highest in quantum
wells. At room temperature, 64% of the modal absorption occurs within quan-
tum wells and 10% within barriers and SCLs (Fig. 7.15). The remaining 26%
originate in the p-InP cladding layer, which is occupied by a considerable part of
the guided wave (cf. Fig. 7.7). At 120◦C, quantum wells cause 60% of the modal
absorption, whereas the contribution of barriers and SCLs rises to 24%. The total
absorption doubles within this temperature range. Absorption by unconﬁned car-
riers rises strongly with temperature elevation; however, passive layer absorption

does not dominate internal optical losses as suggested by more simple models
[170]. The dots in Fig. 7.15 give experimental results for αi, which are smaller
than calculated.As discussed in Section 7.3, this disagreement is an inherent prob-
lem of the experimental method with short lasers and it does not invalidate our
simulation.
Photon losses have less effect on the slope efﬁciency ηd than carrier losses.
From 20 to 120◦C, the optical efﬁciency αm/(αm+αi) only decreases from 74%
to 56% in our case. The temperature sensitivity of the threshold current is also
hardly affected by absorption (Fig. 7.13). However, the threshold current at 120◦C
is almost three times smaller without absorption, mainly due to reduced vertical
leakage.
This chapter analyzed pulsed laser operation without self-heating. Continuous-
wave operation of different types of laser diodes, including heat generation and
heat dissipation, is investigated in the following two chapters.

Vertical-Cavity Laser
Vertical-cavitysurface-emittinglasers(VCSELs)arebrieﬂyintroduced.Using
wafer-bonded long-wavelength VCSELs as an example, we demonstrate how
advanced simulations are utilized in combination with measurements to design
and analyze real devices. Section 8.2 describes the device structure and
Section 8.3 outlines the numerical VCSELmodel. The following sections give
details of the electrical, thermal, optical, and gain analysis. Measurements are
employed to provide unknown device parameters to the simulation.
8.1
Introduction
In VCSELs, the optical cavity is formed by mirrors above and below the active
region (Fig. 8.1). The laser light propagates in the vertical direction and typically
exhibits a circular beam shape, ideal for coupling into optical ﬁbers. Internally, the
light passes the active layers in the vertical direction; i.e., gain is provided over a
short distance only and the ampliﬁcation per photon round trip is small. Therefore,
the mirrors need to be highly reﬂective so that photons make many round trips
before they are emitted. The high reﬂectivity is provided by distributed Bragg
reﬂectors (DBRs) with two alternating layers having high refractive index contrast.
With quarter-wavelength layer thickness, the reﬂected waves from all DBR inter-
faces add up constructively, allowing for DBR reﬂectances above 99%. Dielectric
DBRs like Si/SiO2 provide the highest refractive index contrast, and a few layer
pairs are sufﬁcient for high mirror reﬂectivity. However, semiconductor DBRs are
often prefered in order to inject the current vertically through the mirror into the
active region. AlAs/GaAs DBRs give a relatively high reﬂectivity, but the large
band edge offset at the interfaces causes a high electrical resistance, especially in
p-doped DBRs. Therefore, AlGaAs layers as well as sophisticated compositional
grading and doping schemes are frequently employed at the interfaces. The electri-
cal resistance and other heat sources have the potential to cause strong self-heating
of VCSELs so that good thermal conductivity is another essential requirement of
VCSEL design. For detailed reviews on VCSELs, see [184, 185].
8.2
Long-Wavelength Vertical-Cavity Lasers
Long-wavelength VCSELs (1.3–1.6 µm) are currently of high interest for
applications in ﬁberoptic communication systems. Compared to their in-plane

counterparts, VCSELs offer several advantages, including high ﬁber-coupling
efﬁciency, low power consumption, and low-cost wafer-scale fabrication and test-
ing. In contrast to the rapid development of GaAs-based VCSELs emitting at
shorter wavelengths, the performance of InP-based long-wavelength devices is
severely limited by disadvantageous material properties of the traditional InGaAsP
semiconductor system at long wavelengths. With the lower band gap of the
InGaAsP active region, Auger recombination causes higher nonradiative carrier
losses (cf. Fig. 3.12). With lower photon energy, free-carrier and intervalence
band absorption (IVBA) lead to enhanced optical losses. InGaAsP/InP DBRs only
allow for a small variation of the refractive index, which is about half the variation
possible inAlGaAs.To obtain high DBR reﬂectances, a large number of mirror lay-
ers must be grown causing signiﬁcant diffraction loss [186]. InGaAsPalso exhibits
a low thermal conductivity due to the alloy scattering of phonons (cf. Section 6.1).
An InGaAsP/InP DBR blocks the thermal ﬂux to the stage and it leads to a strong
increase of the active region temperature in continuous-wave (CW) operation.
For overcoming those limitations, several advanced concepts of long-
wavelength VCSELs have been developed [187, 188]. One of the most successful
concepts thus far is the utilization of InP/GaAs wafer bonding [189]. In this

8.2. LONG-WAVELENGTH VERTICAL-CAVITY LASERS
173
way, traditional InP-based active regions can be combined with superior GaAs-
based mirrors and record-high lasing temperatures have been achieved [190, 191].
A wafer-bonded 1.55-µm VCSEL is shown schematically in Fig. 8.1 [192]. In this
bottom-emitting device, 30 periods of GaAs/Al0.67Ga0.33As form the top DBR pil-
lar, which is covered by a metal contact on a GaAs phase-matching layer to enhance
reﬂectivity. A ring contact can be used for top emission. The mirror absorption is
kept small by using relatively low p-doping (Table 8.1). The layer interfaces are
parabolically graded to reduce the interface electrical resistance [193]. Close to the
bonded interface, the mirror contains a 20-nm-thin Al0.98Ga0.33As layer for lat-
eral oxidation, which is used for electrical and optical conﬁnement. The InGaAsP
multi quantum well (MQW) active region consists of 7 quantum wells with about
1% compressive strain and strain-compensating barriers. It is sandwiched between
InP spacer layers, which are about 300 nm thick to give a total cavity thickness
of three half-wavelengths. The bottom 28-period GaAs/AlAs DBR is pulse doped
at all interfaces, in addition to uniform silicon doping. Binary layers are used for
high reﬂectivity and good thermal conductivity. Several variations of this structure,
with and without oxide conﬁnement, are investigated in the following.

Model and Parameters
The complexity and the interaction of electrical, thermal, and optical processes in
VCSELs require advanced numerical models for device analysis and optimization.
In order to analyze VCSEL performance near threshold, we use a comprehensive
two-dimensional model that has produced excellent agreement with a variety
of measurements [167, 194, 195]. Carrier transport is simulated using the
drift–diffusion model. The heat ﬂux equation is included to address self-heating
effects. Gain calculations are based on 4 × 4 ⃗k · ⃗p band structure computations
for the strained quantum wells. The transmission matrix method is employed for
optical simulation including temperature effects on layer thickness, absorption,
and refractive index. The lateral optical modes are given by Bessel functions.
Such a comprehensive model includes various material parameters, some
of which are not exactly known. An important ﬁrst step of every device sim-
ulation is to identify critical parameters and to calibrate them using measured
device characteristics. Table 8.1 lists some of those parameters, the calibration
procedures are discussed in the following sections. The measurements include
variations of threshold current and slope efﬁciency with DBR diameter and with
temperature (Figs. 8.2, 8.3) [167]. These pulsed measurements were taken on the
ﬁrst long-wavelength VCSELs that showed continuous-wave lasing above room

temperature [196]. With a lower aperture diameter, lateral leakage currents and
optical conﬁnement losses increase, leading to a rising threshold current density
and falling slope efﬁciency. Similar tendencies are observed with higher tempera-
ture, since stronger pumping is required for lasing, resulting in higher carrier losses
(cf. Chap. 7). Calibration of model parameters related to those mechanisms gives
good agreement between measurements and simulations.
8.4
Carrier Transport Effects
The carrier transport through the double-bondedVCSELis affected by a large num-
ber of heterointerfaces. One of the most critical interfaces is the p-side bonded
junction. Ideally, this interface between GaAs and InP exhibits only a small band
offset [197]. However, in some bonded VCSELs, positively charged defects were
found to create a large potential barrier in the valence band [198]. Figure 8.4 shows
the band diagram along the VCSEL axis, from the n-InP spacer layer, through the
MQW active region, the p-InP spacer layer, and the bonded interface, to the ﬁrst
GaAs layer of the top DBR. Without interface charges, the small valence band
offset of 0.05 eV would only slightly hinder hole injection. In comparison, an
interface charge density of 1013 cm−2 creates a potential barrier for holes that
is more than 0.5 eV high. At lasing threshold, these interface defects create an

additional voltage drop of Vf ≈1V, which increases the threshold voltage signiﬁ-
cantly (Fig. 8.4). Ideally, the threshold voltage should not be much larger than the
MQW Fermi level separation of VMQW ≈0.8V. The ﬁt to the measured current–
voltage curve results in an interface defect density of 1.7 × 1013 cm−2 for this
device [198].

two leakage mechanisms can be distinguished near the active region: vertical and

8.4. CARRIER TRANSPORT EFFECTS
177
lateral leakage. Vertical leakage is caused by carriers that leave the active region
in the vertical z direction by thermionic emission. The band diagram in Fig. 8.4
illustrates that the thermionic emission of electrons into the lowly doped p-InP
spacer is more likely than the leakage of holes in the opposite direction. Vertical
electron leakage can be reduced by incorporating InGaP barrier layers with a
slightly larger band gap as shown in Fig. 8.4 [199].
Lateral leakage currents are based on two different mechanisms. First is the
lateral diffusion of carriers in the active layer. This ambipolar diffusion process is
dominated by the diffusivity of holes. Second is the lateral hole drift within the
upper p-InP spacer layer, which is enhanced by the electrical resistance of the
lowly doped InP layer underneath. Both lateral leakage currents can be clearly
distinguished in Fig. 8.5, which plots the two-dimensional (2D) distribution of
Figure 8.5: Lateral component of the hole current density, jp,r(r, z) (dDBR =
12 µm, no oxide layer).

axis).
the lateral hole current density, jp,r(r, z). The magnitude of current spreading
depends on the hole mobility within the upper spacer layer. The ﬁt to the measured
dependence jth(dDBR) in Fig. 8.2 gives µp = 30 cm2/Vs for the upper InP layer,
which is smaller than expected due to material damage from reactive ion etching.
Oxide conﬁnement within the top DBR further enhances lateral leakage cur-
rents. The spreading current is especially severe with positively charged defects at
the p-side bonded interface.After being funneled through the oxide aperture, holes
encounter the high interface resistance, which forces them to spread out laterally
before entering the InPlayer. This partially eliminates the conﬁnement effect of the
oxide layer. The current contour plot in Fig. 8.6 illustrates the inﬂuence of charged
interface defects. Narrow contours indicate a high current density near the edge
of the oxide aperture. Lateral current spreading between oxide layer and bonded
interface is much stronger with (left) than without (right) interface defects.
The current crowding at the oxide aperture edge leads to a laterally nonuniform
hole distribution in the MQW region, which is most severe in the p-side quantum
well (Fig. 8.7). This nonuniformity is smoothened as holes move toward the n-side
quantum wells. The relatively large MQW valence band offset makes it difﬁcult
for holes to cross the barriers between the quantum wells. Therefore, the hole
concentration is highest in the p-side quantum well, as discussed in Section 7.4.
Electrons move more easily across the MQW, and they adapt to the nonuniform
hole distribution.
8.5
Thermal Analysis
The electrical resistance of interfaces and bulk layers, as well as nonradiative
recombination in the active layers are main heat sources in VCSELs (cf. Chap. 6).

8.5. THERMAL ANALYSIS
179
Figure 8.7: 2D surface plot of the hole concentration p(r, z) (1018 cm−3) in the
MQW active region (5 quantum wells, 2.5 µm oxide aperture radius, no interface
charges).
Joule heat depends on the local current density. In the following, aperture size
effects on the VCSEL self-heating near threshold are evaluated using a simpliﬁed
electro-thermal analysis.
At laser threshold, the total heat power is approximately given by the voltage
drop across the device times the injection current VthIth. The VCSEL threshold
voltage Vth includes the resistance of various DBR interfaces, which is hard to
calculate correctly. Instead, current–voltage measurements on nonoxidized DBR
stacks are evaluated [200] to obtain an average p-DBR hole mobility
µz(j) = 0.12 cm2/Vs × (j (kA/cm2))−0.6
(8.1)
as a function of the current density j. In the lateral direction, the p-DBR hole
mobility µr = 220 cm2/Vs is much larger, and so is the electron mobility in the
n-DBR (Table 8.1). The resistance of the p-doped InP/GaAs interface is assumed
to be 8 ×10−4  cm2. A minor heat contribution also arises from the p-contact
resistance of 2 × 10−4 cm2 [200].
The dissipation of heat power inside the device is often characterized by the
thermal resistance Rth. This number is usually determined as the average active

180
CHAPTER 8. VERTICAL-CAVITY LASER
region temperature rise TMQW divided by the heat power. The thermal resistance
of VCSELs is typically on the order of 103 K/W, one order of magnitude larger than
in edge-emitting lasers [201]. This high number results from the smaller size of the
heat source as well as from the low thermal conductivity κL of DBRs. The small
DBR layer thickness restricts the phonon mean free path, and it therefore reduces
the thermal conductivity. For our binary AlAs/GaAs n-DBRs, the average thermal
conductivity is measured to be about half of the expected average bulk value
[202]. The DBR’s thermal conductivity is larger in the lateral direction than in the
vertical direction [203]. AlGaAs exhibits a strong alloy scattering of phonons. In
agreement with these results, anisotropic thermal conductivities are used as given
in Table 8.1. An average temperature dependence of κL ∝T −1.375 is included
[69], and a value of κL = 0.2 W/cmK is assumed for the oxide layer.
Lateral oxidation allows for very small active areas and very low threshold
currents Ith. In oxidized 1.55-µm VCSELs, Ith = 0.8 mA was reported with
an oxide aperture of dox ≈2.4 µm, resulting in a threshold current density of
jth ≈18 kA/cm2 [204]. This large current density is related to lateral carrier leak-
age and optical scattering losses that increase with smaller oxide aperture. The
measured dependence jth(dox) is given in Fig. 8.8 (dots), and it is compared to the
ideal case of constant threshold current density jth = 1 kA/cm2 (dashed line).

Figure 8.9: Temperature distribution T (r, z) as calculated in the center part of the
VCSEL.
Figure 8.9 illustrates the calculated temperature distribution T (r, z) in the cen-
ter part of the device. The heat ﬂows perpendicular to the isothermal lines and
it uses the top DBR for lateral dissipation. Thus, even with a bottom heat sink,
the thermal conductivity of layers above the heat source matters. Downsizing the
active area causes a dramatic increase of the thermal resistance (Fig. 8.8). This is
attributed to the reduced initial escape area for the heat generated in the center of
the device. In our case, the simulations result in Rth ∝d−0.68
ox
.
The calculated average temperature rise TMQW inside the active region
of the oxidized VCSEL is plotted in Fig. 8.8. With constant threshold cur-
rent density (dashed line), the self-heating at threshold vanishes for very small
apertures. This is despite the strong increase of Rth since the heat power is
reduced even stronger (Ith ∝d2
ox). In the measured case of increasing thresh-
old current density (solid line), a minimum temperature rise occurs at dox =
8 µm, which is in good agreement with the experimental results [204]. This
optimum aperture size gives the lowest heat power generation. Self-heating
can be further minimized by reducing lateral leakage and optical losses with
low apertures.
8.6
Optical Simulation
Calculation of the internal optical ﬁeld is one of the most challenging tasks of
VCSELsimulations, especially when oxide conﬁnement layers are involved [205].
A precise optical analysis requires elaborate solutions of Maxwell’s equations for

182
CHAPTER 8. VERTICAL-CAVITY LASER
an open resonator [206, 207, 208]. Simpliﬁed optical models are often applied in
practical VCSEL simulations.
For our nonoxidized VCSELs, we here describe the combination of a simple
optical VCSEL model with experimental results in order to correctly simulate the
VCSEL performance near threshold [167]. The model is based on the effective
index method
[209], and it decouples vertical and lateral mode proﬁles. The
lateral mode shape is approximated by Bessel functions, which are solutions to the
Helmholtz equation for cylindrical waveguides (Fig. 8.10).
The transmission matrix method is utilized to obtain the standing optical wave
in the vertical direction (Fig. 8.11). DBR layers are quarter-wavelength thick
and the standing wave exhibits antinodes (peaks) or nodes (nulls) at the mirror
interfaces. Nodes are located at the bonded interfaces so that interface absorp-
tion is minimized. The resonance wavelength λcav is given by the optical mirror
distance (index × thickness). For maximum gain, the MQW region is located at
the peak of the standing wave. Table 8.1 lists the material parameters nr and αo
essential for the optical simulation. These parameters shall now be discussed in
more detail.
The temperature dependence of the refractive index nr(T ) has consider-
able impact not only on the emission wavelength but also on DBR reﬂectivity,
slope efﬁciency, and threshold gain [210]. The value of dnr/dT is different for
each material (cf. Table 4.3) so that the interface refractive index step changes

with temperature. For realistic continuous-wave simulations, the refractive index
of each layer is determined as a function of the local temperature. Thermal
expansion is also included but its inﬂuence is negligible.
At room temperature, the measured emission wavelength is λcav = 1542 nm.
In order to reproduce this number in the simulation, the InP spacer thickness is
slightly adjusted. Inhomogeneities of several tens of nanometers across the InP
wafer are not surprising. Slight deviations of other layers or of refractive indices
are also possible but hard to separate.
Photon absorption in ourVCSELs is mainly caused by holes (cf. Section 7.2.3).
However, scattering losses at the rough sidewall of the top DBR pillar must be
added to the average bulk absorption of 8 cm−1. These sidewall losses depend on
the pillar diameter dDBR. They are hard to calculate but they can be extracted from
the measured slope efﬁciency [211]. The ﬁt to the experimental characteristic
ηd(dDBR) in Fig. 8.2 gives the p-DBR optical loss as

Temperature Effects on the Optical Gain
In vertical-cavity lasers, the wavelength λgain of maximum gain needs to be
adjusted to the emission wavelength λcav. The gain offset λgain −λcav depends on
the temperature since λcav shifts with changing refractive index and λgain shifts
with changing MQW band gap (Fig. 8.12). The adjustment of the gain offset is a
critical VCSEL design issue in order to reduce temperature effects on the thresh-
old current Ith [212]. Minimum temperature sensitivity (dIth/dT = 0) is obtained
at the minimum of the threshold current temperature characteristic Ith(T ). It is a
common VCSEL design rule that the threshold current Ith(T ) has its minimum
at zero gain offset [213, 214]. However, this design rule does not seem to apply
to InP-based long-wavelength VCSELs for which the lowest threshold current is
measured at considerable negative gain offset (Fig. 8.12) [194, 195, 215]. We shall
investigate this phenomenon in the following.
In our VCSEL, the emission wavelength shift with temperature is dλcav/dT =
0.11 nm/K. The photoluminescence (PL) peak wavelength shift with temperature
was measured on similar MQWs to be dλPL/dT = 0.54 nm/K, giving a thermal
band gap shrinkage of dEg/dT = −0.28 meV/K [216], which is about two-thirds

of typical GaAs values [69]. The PL peak is only a few nanometers blue-shifted
from the gain peak (cf. Fig. 5.11). Zero gain offset is at 24◦C.
The calculated threshold current density jth(T ) agrees very well with the exper-
imental data (Fig. 8.12). IVBA and Auger recombination have been identiﬁed
as the most temperature-sensitive loss mechanisms in 1.55-µm VCSELs [167].
Exclusion of those two loss mechanisms from the model gives the dashed curve in
Fig. 8.12. As result of this exclusion, the position of the jth(T ) minimum is only
slightly shifted to −40◦C, indicating that the minimum of the threshold current is
a gain-related effect.
Based on the good agreement of our model with experimental data, temper-
ature effects on the calculated gain are now evaluated in more detail. The effect
of the temperature on the MQW gain spectrum is plotted in Fig. 8.13 for constant
carrier concentration. The dots indicate the VCSEL emission wavelength λcav(T )
and the modal gain at each temperature. At 20◦C, the gain peak wavelength
λgain = 1540 nm is only 2 nm smaller than the emission wavelength λcav. As
the temperature is reduced, the gain peak is not only blue-shifted, the maximum

temperatures, T . The dots give the emission wavelength λcav(T ) and the modal
gain.

CHAPTER 8. VERTICAL-CAVITY LASER
of the gain spectrum also increases strongly (dgmax/dT = −10 cm−1 K−1). This
increase is attributed to the decreased Fermi spreading of carriers in the quantum
wells. The maximum modal gain is reached at −40◦C corresponding to −30 nm
gain offset. Without loss effects and with almost constant threshold gain, this max-
imum modal gain results in a minimum threshold current at the same temperature
(dashed curve in Fig. 8.12). Thus, the simulation clearly shows that about −30 nm
gain offset is necessary in these 1.55-µm VCSELs to obtain minimum threshold
current. The optical cavity mode does not receive maximum gain at zero gain
offset, as commonly assumed.

Nitride Light Emitters
This chapter presents the simulation of milestone device structures of blue
light-emitting diodes and laser diodes fabricated by Nakamura et al. on
GaN. Performance-limiting physical mechanisms like self-heating, current
crowding, and carrier leakage are investigated. Unique material properties of
wurtzite nitride compounds such as high-ﬁeld electron mobility and built-in
polarization ﬁelds are discussed.
9.1
Introduction
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes based on GaN were pioneered by
Shuji Nakamura and coworkers in the 1990s, and they soon became commercially
available [217]. The active region of these devices is made of InGaN, which can
cover the wide wavelength range from violet to red (Fig. 9.1).At room temperature,
GaN has a band gap wavelength of λg = 363 nm and InN exhibits λg = 657 nm.
Especially blue and green nitride LEDs are now widely used, for instance, in full-
color displays and in trafﬁc signals. Nitride laser diodes have great potential in a
number of applications such as optical data storage, printing, full-color displays,
chemical sensors, and medical applications. The data capacity of digital versatile
disks (DVDs) can be increased from 4.7 to more than 15 Gbytes by using blue
InGaN lasers instead of red AlInGaP lasers.
Nitride devices are typically grown in the hexagonal (wurtzite) crystal system,
whichisenergeticallyfavoredovercubic(zincblende)nitrides(cf.Fig.2.10).Band

substrates are currently not available for GaN. Sapphire or SiC are mainly used
as substrates with lattice constants a0 of 4.758 and 3.08Å, respectively. Despite
intense research efforts worldwide on nitride devices, major technological chal-
lenges, as well as the need for a more detailed understanding of microscopic
physical processes, remain. Numerical simulation can help to investigate those
processes and to establish quantitative links between material properties and mea-
sured device performance. Many general nitride material parameters are given
in Part I, for instance in Table 2.7. Additional and more unique nitride prop-
erties are discussed in the next Section, including alloy bowing parameters. In
Section 9.3, we present the simulation and analysis of nitride LEDs usingAPSYS.

Nitride Material Properties
9.2.1
Carrier Transport
A major handicap with nitride semiconductors is the high activation energy of the
common magnesium acceptor, which causes the hole concentration to be consid-
erably smaller than the acceptor concentration. A magnesium activation energy of
170 meV was reported for GaN [218], which is assumed to increase by 3 meV per
percent of Al for AlGaN. In n-type material, the silicon donor activation energy is
about 20 meV [219].
GaN room-temperature electron mobilities near 900 cm2/Vs have been mea-
sured with low doping, which are reduced by more than an order of magnitude
with high doping (Fig. 9.2) [220]. Monte Carlo simulations of various nitride alloys
have recently been used to establish analytical expressions for the electron mobil-
ity as a function of donor concentration ND, temperature T , and electrostatic ﬁeld

listed in Table 3.2. Results are plotted in Fig. 9.3 for different alloys.
Hole mobilities are much less investigated. For Mg-doped GaN, µp =
15 cm2/Vs has been measured with low hole concentration and 2 cm2/Vs with high
hole concentration [222]. This results in a hole conductivity that hardly varies with
the doping density. Mobility reduction with temperature elevation was measured

as µn ∝T −1.5 [219] and µp ∝T −6 [223]. This temperature effect on the hole
mobility is much stronger than with other III–V compounds [62].
Defect-related recombination is known to be the main carrier loss mech-
anism in nitride devices. The Shockley–Read–Hall recombination lifetime of
electrons and holes is on the order of 1 ns; however, the type and concentration
of recombination centers are sensitive to the technological process. For bulk GaN
layers, a spontaneous emission parameter B of 1.1×10−8 cm3 s−1 was measured
[224],whichisalmostthreeordersofmagnitudehigherthantheoreticalestimations
(2×10−11 cm3 s−1 [225]). The spontaneous recombination rate in quantum wells
is larger than in bulk layers, and it can be calculated by integration of the sponta-
neous emission spectrum. A small GaN Auger parameter of C = 10−34 cm6 s−1 is
estimated using its band gap dependence in other materials (Fig. 3.12). Thus, even
with large carrier concentrations, Auger recombination in nitride materials is
negligible.
9.2.2
Energy Bands
A wide spectrum of band gap bowing parameters has been obtained for ternary
nitride alloys due to differences in growth and measurement conditions [36, 226].
For unstrained layers with a low mole fraction of the alloy element (x < 0.3), we
employ the following room-temperature relations for the direct band gap (eV)
Eg(InxGa1−xN) = 1.89x + 3.42(1 −x) −3.8x(1 −x)
(9.3)
Eg(AlxGa1−xN) = 6.28x + 3.42(1 −x) −1.3x(1 −x),
(9.4)
which is plotted in Fig. 9.1.Aband offset ratio of Ec/Ev = 0.7/0.3 is assumed
for InGaN/GaN as well as for AlGaN/GaN, which corresponds to an average of
reported values for each case [33, 227].
For the strained InGaN quantum wells investigated in this chapter, the con-
duction bands are assumed to be parabolic and the nonparabolic valence bands
are computed by the 6 × 6 ⃗k · ⃗p method (cf. Section 2.2.4). Binary effective mass
parameters, lattice constants, and elastic constants fromTable 2.7 are linearly inter-
polated to obtain InGaN values. GaN values are used for the deformation potentials
[29]. Calculated valence bands are shown in Fig. 9.4. Similar band structures have
been calculated by other authors [228]. For such nitride layers, grown along the
c axis, the quantum well strain is biaxial, lowering the crystal-ﬁeld split-hole (CH)
band but hardly separating heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands; i.e., strain
is not as effective in reducing the threshold carrier concentration as in GaAs- or
InP-based lasers. Uniaxial strain promises lower threshold currents [229]. Thermal
band gap shrinkage is considered with dEg/dT = −0.6 meV/K [32]. Band gap
renormalization caused by carrier–carrier interaction was found to depend on the

Polarization
Built-in electrical ﬁelds in semiconductors can be caused by spontaneous polariza-
tion Psp or by strain-induced polarization Ppiezo. These polarization effects were
found to be much stronger in c-face nitrides than in other III–V compounds [231].

compounds, these numbers may be interpolated linearly; however, some nonlin-
ear behavior has recently been observed [233]. Since different alloy compositions
show different polarization, net charges remain at their interfaces. For ternary
nitride alloys grown on GaN, Fig. 9.5 plots the net interface charge density as
well as the resulting electrostatic ﬁeld within the alloy. These built-in ﬁelds sig-
niﬁcantly affect the properties of quantum wells [234]. The corresponding band
diagram is illustrated in Fig. 9.6. The wider the quantum well, the more separated
the electrons and holes, and the smaller the optical gain and spontaneous emis-
sion. Similar to the electroabsorption effect illustrated in Fig. 10.1, the transition
energy is reduced by the built-in ﬁeld, leading to a red-shift of the emission wave-
length. However, with increasing carrier injection into the quantum well, charge

screening is expected to reduce polarization ﬁeld effects [235]. These screening
effects result in a blue-shift of the emission wavelength as measured on nitride
LEDs [236].
9.2.4
Refractive Index
Optical reﬂection and waveguiding mainly depend on the refractive index proﬁle
inside the device. For photon energies close to the band gap, the refractive index is
a strong function of wavelength. For binary nitride compounds, the modeling
of this function is discussed in Section 4.2.2. In ternary alloys, those models
need to be modiﬁed to include the composition as parameter. For the design of
optical waveguides, the compositional change of the refractive index is often more
important than its absolute value. In comparison to refractive index measurements
on AlxGa1−xN (x < 0.38), the Adachi model (Eq. (4.34)) was found to be most
accurate using the parameters [120]
A(x) = 9.827 −8.216x −31.59x2
(9.7)
B(x) = 2.736 + 0.842x −6.293x2.
(9.8)
Reliable refractive index measurements on InxGa1−xN are currently not avail-
able, so a linear interpolation between binary parameters A and B is chosen here
(cf. Table 4.2)
A(x) = 9.827(1 −x) −53.57x
(9.9)
B(x) = 2.736(1 −x) −9.19x.
(9.10)

Figure 9.7: Refractive index for different alloy compositions with the wavelength
given as a parameter (nm).
In addition, we employ the band gap relations given in Eqs. (9.3) and (9.4), respec-
tively. The resulting refractive index is plotted in Fig. 9.7. Other authors employ
Sellmeier-type models for GaN (Eq. (4.28)) and predict the ternary refractive index
by adjusting the photon energy according to the band gap change [237]. For pho-
ton energies close to the band gap, this phenomenological approach is less reliable
than the Adachi model (cf. Section 4.2.2). In InGaN quantum wells, the refractive
index is modiﬁed due to the increased transition energy and other effects [238].
9.2.5
Thermal Conductivity
Measurements of the thermal conductivity are hardly published for nitride
alloys. For GaN, a room-temperature value of 1.3 W/cmK is reported in [38].
Further thermal parameters for nitride binaries are given in Table 6.1.
Alloy scattering can reduce the thermal conductivity of semiconductor compounds
by more than one order of magnitude (cf. Fig. 6.1). However, the bowing parameter
CABC in Eq. (6.7) is unknown for ternary nitride alloys. In addition, phonon scat-
tering at the interfaces of thin layers is known to reduce their thermal conductivity

InGaN/GaN Light-Emitting Diode
9.3.1
Device Structure
As a practical example, we here investigate single-quantum-well (SQW) blue
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as described in [239]. These devices exhibit an out-
put power of 4.8 mW at 20 mA injection current and 3.1V forward voltage. The
low voltage results in a relatively high power efﬁciency of 7.7% (ratio of light
power to electrical power). The external quantum efﬁciency is as high as 8.7%
despite the large dislocation density of about 1010 cm−2 [240]. Fluctuations of
the Indium composition within the InGaN quantum well are assumed to localize
carriers in radiative centers and to prevent them from recombining nonradiatively
at dislocations [241].
The device was grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)
on c-face sapphire. The layer sequence is given in Table 9.3 and the band dia-
gram is shown in Fig. 9.8. The 2-nm-thick undoped quantum well is sandwiched
between n-In0.02Ga0.98N and p-Al0.3Ga0.7N. After growth, the structure was
partially etched to expose the n-GaN layer. A Ti/Al contact was deposited on
the n-GaN layer and a semitransparent Ni/Au contact on the top p-GaN layer
(Fig. 9.9). Part of the top p-contact was covered by a nontransparent bonding
pad. The wafer was cut into rectangular LED chips (300 × 300 µm2), which were
molded onto a lead frame.

CHAPTER 9. NITRIDE LIGHT EMITTERS
9.3.2
Polarization Effects
Recombination mechanisms in real InGaN quantum wells are still not fully
understood. Polarization, nonuniform indium distribution, and exciton effects
may have a major inﬂuence [242]. We start here with a simple free-carrier model
to calculate the spontaneous emission spectrum for the nonsymmetric quantum
well. According to experimental results [236], the interface polarization charges
derived from Eq. (9.6) are assumed to be partially screened by charged defects
so that only about half of them contribute to the built-in polarization ﬁeld. The
effect of these net polarization charges on the LED quantum well is shown in
Fig. 9.10, including screening by electrons and holes. Without polarization, the
internal electrical ﬁeld of the pn-junction is positive and the holes accumulate at
the p-side of the quantum well. With polarization, the electrical ﬁeld is strongly
negative within the quantum well and the holes accumulate at the n-side. In both
cases, the peak of the electron distribution is near the center of the quantum well.
Due to the more nonsymmetric quantum barriers, there are less conﬁned electrons
without polarization. Built-in polarization allows for more quantum levels.
Calculated spectra of the spontaneous emission in Fig. 9.11 exhibit a reduc-
tion of the peak emission intensity due to the polarization ﬁeld. We assume here
uniform current injection at room temperature. Lorentzian broadening with an
intraband scattering time of 0.1 ps gives a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of 8 nm without polarization. Due to the additional conﬁned quantum states, built-
in polarization results in a broader line shape with FWHM = 17 nm. The measured
line broadening of 25 nm [239] also includes the effect of ﬂuctuations in quantum
well composition, width, strain, and polarization, which are not considered in our
model [243]. Built-in polarization red-shifts the emission peak by only 1 nm due
to the opposite tilt of the quantum well in both cases (Fig. 9.10). With polarization,
the integrated spontaneous emission rate is enhanced by about 20%.
9.3.3
Current Crowding
The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the LED is approximated in our 2D
APSYS simulation as shown in Fig. 9.12. The pn-junction is 160 µm wide and
300 µm long, giving about the same top emission area as with the real device
(Fig. 9.9). The simulated device is uniform in longitudinal (z) direction so that all
xy cross-sections are identical. The Ni/Au semitransparent p-contact is treated as
a perfect conductor and the current is uniformly injected across the top surface.
However, due to the low conductivity of p-doped nitrides, strong current crowd-
ing is observed in the simulation (Fig. 9.12). The carriers choose the current path
of lowest total resistance, which depends on the conductivity of each material
involved.
In our case of a perfect p-contact, most of the radiation is generated close to
the inner edge of the device. Figure 9.13 plots the 2D distribution of the emission

rate near the edge. Due to the polarization ﬁeld, the holes are localized at the lower
edge of the quantum well and cause the radiation peak there.At the simulated high
current injection (I = 100 mA), holes also leak out into the InGaN barrier region,
causing emission at shorter wavelengths as observed experimentally [244].

temperature rise of Tmax = 73 K occurs at the edge of the device. The calcu-
lated self-heating is in good agreement with experimental observations on similar
devices [245]. However, due to the relatively high thermal conductivity of GaN,
the internal LED temperature is almost uniform. It is 97.5oC at the GaN/sapphire
interface, corresponding to a 72.5-K temperature rise above the 25oC ambient
temperature. In other words, the self-heating is due to the high thermal resistance
of substrate and packaging. Current crowding and self-heating cause a further
red-shift of the emission peak to 435 nm wavelength. The measured emission
wavelength of 450 nm is slightly longer, which indicates a nonuniform indium
distribution along the quantum well.
9.3.4
Quantum Efﬁciency
The external quantum efﬁciency ηext gives the average number of photons emitted
per injected electron. It can be separated into internal photon generation efﬁciency
and optical photon extraction efﬁciency
ηext = ηint × ηopt.
(9.11)
These absolute efﬁciencies should not be confused with the differential efﬁciencies
of laser diodes (cf. Chap. 7). We shall ﬁrst discuss the internal efﬁciency, ηint.

arrows are shown for less than 10% of the maximum current density).
Figure 9.15 plots the calculated internal light power Pint(I) as well as ηint(I).
The internal efﬁciency is the fraction of photons generated per injected electron.
Without any carrier losses, the maximum possible value is ηint = 1. This efﬁciency
is directly related to the Pint(I) curve

(hν, photon energy). It can also be calculated from the ratio of the spontaneous
recombination current Ispon to the total current. The total current includes contri-
butions to nonradiative recombination within the quantum well (Inr) and carrier
leakage from the quantum well (Ileak). Leaking carriers eventually recombine
outside the quantum well, where we assume nonradiative lifetimes of 0.1 ns for
AlGaN and 1 ns for all other layers. The nonradiative carrier lifetime τnr inside the
InGaN quantum well is considered large but it is hard to measure. In our simu-
lation, we assume the ideal case of an extremely long lifetime τnr = 1µs, which

renders nonradiative recombination irrelevant inside the quantum well (Inr = 0).
Thus, our calculated maximum of ηint = 0.91 is limited by carrier leakage. With
higher current and higher temperature, the leakage losses increase and reduce the
efﬁciency in Fig. 9.15.
After photons are generated inside the semiconductor, they need to be extracted
from the LED to be visible. The optical extraction efﬁciency ηopt gives the fraction
of photons that escape from the device per photon generated inside. Photon escape
is mainly limited by total internal reﬂection. Our device is encapsulated in an
epoxy dome with a refractive index of about ne = 1.5. This gives a critical angle
of 37◦(cf. Eq. (4.56)), which is considerably wider than that of 26◦in conventional
LEDs. By integration over the escape cone, the optical quantum efﬁciency of the
top surface can be approximated as

The last factor accounts for the transmission from the epoxy to air. With a semi-
conductor index of about ns = 2.5, this equation gives ηtop
opt = 0.096 for our top
surface. Multiple reﬂections inside the device and emission from other surfaces
shall give a larger value for the total optical efﬁciency. Ray tracing based on sim-
ple plane wave theory is often used to simulate the photon extraction from LEDs

CHAPTER 9. NITRIDE LIGHT EMITTERS
(cf. Chap. 4); however, the 2D ray tracing model currently included in APSYS
is not able to give realistic results for our 3D device. For low photon absorp-
tion, an upper limit of ηopt = 0.68 was estimated for blue LEDs on a sapphire
substrate [246].

InGaN/GaN Laser Diode
The LASTIP laser model self-consistently combines wurtzite band structure and
gain calculations with 2D simulations of wave guiding, carrier transport, and heat
ﬂux. As a practical nitride laser example, we investigate here ridge–waveguide
Fabry–Perot laser diodes with two InGaN/GaN quantum wells as demonstrated in
[247]. These devices exhibit high-power lasing up to 420 mW in continuous-wave
operation.
9.4.1
Device Structure
The layer structure is given in Table 9.4 and the band diagram in Fig. 9.16.
The active region comprises two 4-nm-thick InGaN quantum wells with 1.6%
compressive strain as well as an AlGaN electron stopper layer. It is sandwiched
between GaN separate conﬁnement layers and superlattice (SL) AlGaN/GaN
cladding layers. The thickness of the n-side cladding layer was increased from
600 to 1200 nm to reduce the penetration of the laser light into the GaN substrate.
In the simulation, we replace the superlattice by bulk Al0.07Ga0.93N. The verti-
cal proﬁles of the refractive index and the optical mode are plotted in Fig. 9.17.
For lateral conﬁnement, a 3-µm-wide ridge is etched into the top two layers. For
this laser, calculated optical near and far ﬁelds are plotted in Fig. 4.23. The optical
conﬁnement factor is 	o = 0.034. The laser cavity is 450 µm long. The cleaved
front facet has a power reﬂectivity of Rf = 0.18 and the back facet is coated with
two periods of SiO2/TiO2 for high reﬂectivity (Rb = 0.95).
9.4.2
Optical Gain
The optical gain mechanism in InGaN quantum wells of real lasers is not yet fully
understood. It may be strongly affected by a nonuniform Indium distribution.
Internal polarization ﬁelds tend to separate quantum conﬁned electrons and holes,
thereby reducing optical gain and spontaneous emission. However, screening by
electrons and holes is expected to suppress quantum well polarization ﬁelds at
high power operation. The high carrier concentration also eliminates excitons.
On the other hand, many-body models predict signiﬁcant gain enhancement at
high carrier concentrations [248]. Considering all the uncertainties in calculating
the gain of real InGaN quantum wells, we here start with a simple free-carrier gain
model, including a Lorentzian broadening function with 0.1 ps scattering time [34].

Comparison to Measurements
The common carrier mobility model of Eq. 3.28 results in good agreement between
the simulated and the measured current–voltage (IV ) characteristic (Fig. 9.19).
This indicates that the contact resistance is of minor importance in this device.
To ﬁnd simultaneous agreement with the measured light–current (LI) charac-
teristic, three ﬁtted parameters, which are unknown for the present device, are
employed: the internal modal loss αi, the defect (SRH) recombination lifetime
within the quantum wells τqw, and the thermal resistance Rth. The modal loss con-
trols the slope efﬁciency, the lifetime affects the threshold current, and the thermal
resistance has main impact on the power roll-off. The ﬁtted values αi = 12 cm−1,
τqw = 0.5 ns, and Rth = 75 K/W result in an excellent reproduction of the
experimental LI curve (Fig. 9.19). All three numbers are reasonable and conﬁrm

the accuracy of the laser model. In further agreement with the experimental
observation [247], a ﬁrst-order lateral laser mode emerges at a higher injection
current in Fig. 9.19.
9.4.4
Power Limitations
The output power roll-off of laser diodes is typically attributed to the self-heating in
continuous-wave operation. The data in Fig. 9.19 indicate that about Pheat = 4W
total heat power is generated at the output power maximum. Considering 75 K/W
thermal resistance, the internal temperature rise can be estimated as T = 300 K
(cf. Eq. (6.16)). The contour plot of the calculated temperature distribution T (x, y)
in Fig. 9.20 conﬁrms this strong self-heating. The different heat sources are also
plotted in this ﬁgure. Joule heat in the highly resistive p-doped regions dominates
the power budget by far.The much smaller contribution from phonons generated by

defect recombination is partially compensated for by Thomson cooling, which rep-
resents the phonon absorption by carriers, for example, during thermionic emission
from the quantum wells. Heat from photon absorption is of minor importance.
The strong self-heating reduces the optical gain substantially (Fig. 9.18), which
is mainly caused by a wider Fermi spreading of carriers. Consequently, the carrier
concentration increases with higher temperature (Fig. 9.21). The quantum well
electron concentration is about 2 × 1019 cm−3 at threshold but it is substantially
higher at the power maximum. This leads to enhanced recombination losses but,

210
CHAPTER 9. NITRIDE LIGHT EMITTERS
most of all, to an escalation of electron leakage from the quantum wells into the
p-side. The bottom part of Fig. 9.21 plots the vertical electron current proﬁle.
At threshold, all electrons recombine within the quantum wells and no electron
leaks into the p-side. At maximum power, a considerable portion of electrons
escapes across the AlGaN stopper layer. This vertical electron leakage amounts to
more than one-third of the total carrier losses at maximum power. As it prevents
carriers from stimulated recombination, it is the main reason for the power roll-
off [249].
9.4.5
Performance Optimization
Reduction of the self-heating seems to be the key to higher maximum output power.
This can be achieved by lowering the heat power generation or by improved heat
dissipation. The electrical resistance of the p-doped layers constitutes the main
heat source but it cannot be easily reduced since higher p-doping causes a lower
hole mobility. A wider ridge would substantially reduce the self-heating; however,
the higher aspect ratio of the far ﬁeld and the enhanced probability of higher order
lasing modes are not desirable. Improved heat sinking has been demonstrated by
replacing the sapphire substrate with copper [250]. In our simulation, we have used
an external thermal resistance in addition to the simulated internal heat conduction.
This external resistance represents the substrate and heat sink, which contribute
30 K/Wtothetotalthermalresistance,Rth = 75 K/W.Wenowsimplyeliminatethe
external thermal resistance, which reduces the total thermal resistance to 45 K/W.
The resulting LI characteristic exhibits almost double the maximum output power
(Fig. 9.22). The quantum well temperature at maximum power is about the same
as that with the original laser.
Suppression of electron leakage may be achieved by using an AlGaN stopper
layer with a larger band gap. Such a situation is simulated by assuming an AlGaN
electron stopper layer with 25% aluminum. The larger conduction band offset
results in a very slight increase of the maximum output power (Fig. 9.22). This is
due to reduced electron leakage since all other material parameters of the stopper
layer remain unchanged. However, thermal and electrical conductivities decrease
with higher Al content, which is expected to result in lower maximum power.
Antireﬂection coating of the front facet (Rf = 0.02) has a stronger effect on the
maximum power in Fig. 9.22.

Electroabsorption
Modulator
A multiquantum well (MQW) electroabsorption modulator that employs the
quantum conﬁned Stark effect to absorb light near 1.55-µm wavelength is ana-
lyzed. Strained layers are utilized in this device to obtain polarization
insensitive absorption. This is accompanied by strong valence band mixing
near the  point, rendering common effective mass approximations invalid.
The optical transmission is investigated as a function of wavelength and bias.
10.1
Introduction
In optical communication systems, signals are transmitted by modulating the phase
or the intensity of an optical wave.The modulation can be performed directly by the
laser diode that generates the optical wave, e.g., by varying the injection current.
Such direct modulation is accompanied by variations of the carrier concentration in
the active region, which leads to ﬂuctuations of the refractive index and wavelength
(chirp). To reduce the chirp, modulation is often performed externally, after the
optical wave leaves the laser diode. There are generally two types of external mod-
ulators, electro-optic and electroabsorption modulators. The ﬁrst type is based on
the linear electro-optic effect; i.e., on the change of the refractive index by an elec-
tric ﬁeld. By varying the electric ﬁeld, the optical phase is modulated. This phase
modulation can be transformed into intensity modulation using Mach–Zehnder
interferometers. Dielectric materials such as LiNbO3 are most widely used in
electro-optic modulators. They require a relatively high reverse bias of more than
3Vto achieve sufﬁciently strong modulation.The ratio between highest and lowest
signal intensity (extinction ratio) is typically in the range from 15 to 20 dB.
Electroabsorption modulators can achieve the same extinction ratio at lower
voltage. They are based on the electroabsorption effect, i.e., on the change of the
absorption coefﬁcient by an electric ﬁeld. In bulk semiconductors, the absorption
edge moves to lower energies with increasing electric ﬁeld due to a combina-
tion of band-to-band absorption and tunneling processes (Franz–Keldysh effect).
In quantum wells, the transition energy between conﬁned energy levels for elec-
trons and holes is reduced as an electric ﬁeld is applied in the growth direction
(quantum conﬁned Stark effect, QCSE). This effect is illustrated in Fig. 10.1. As

the ﬁeld is increased, the overlap of electron and hole wave functions is reduced,
thereby decreasing the absorption strength at the transition energy. Thick quantum
wells are advantageous for high ﬁeld sensitivity (high modulation efﬁciency),
whereas thin quantum wells give stronger absorption. The formation of bound
electron–hole pairs (excitons) in the quantum well further enhances the absorption
[157]. Compared to bulk materials, quantum well QCSE-type modulators have
higher modulation efﬁciencies (lower drive voltage); however, Franz–Keldysh
type modulators are less wavelength sensitive (larger optical bandwidth).
In this chapter, we present the simulation and analysis of a multiquantum well
QCSE-type modulator [251]. The InGaAsP/InP device is designed for ﬁberoptic
applications near 1550-nm wavelength. The ridge–waveguide device was grown
on semi-insulating (SI) InP; the layer structure is given in Table 10.1 [252].
Section 10.2 evaluates the quantum well design, Section 10.3 investigates the
optical waveguide, and Section 10.4 analyzes optical transmission characteristics.

Multiquantum Well Active Region
Polarization independent performance is an important requirement in many appli-
cations of electroabsorption modulators. In the InGaAsP/InP material system, TE
polarized waves mainly generate heavy holes, whereas TM polarized waves only
generate light holes. The corresponding transition matrix elements result in the

where αhh and αlh are the band-to-band absorption coefﬁcients for the heavy-
and light-hole bands, respectively. Thus, αhh = αlh is a basic requirement for
polarization insensitive modulation. In unstrained quantum wells, the transi-
tion energy for heavy holes is lower than for light holes due to the different
effective mass (cf. Fig. 2.15). To align the absorption edges, the light-hole
band gap needs to be reduced by using tensile strain in the quantum well. The
barrier layers are compressively strained for strain compensation. The active
region of our device comprises ten 10.4-nm-thick InGaAsP quantum wells that
exhibit 0.37% tensile strain (Table 10.1). The InGaAsP barriers are 7.6 nm
thick with 0.5% compressive strain. Calculated absorption spectra are plotted in
Fig. 10.2. Higher reverse voltage reduces the quantum well transition energy,
and it shifts the absorption edge to longer wavelengths. For both voltages, the
absorption edges are almost identical for TE and TM polarized waves. Correct
calculation of the absorption edge shape is essential to ﬁnd good agreement
with modulation measurements. This shape depends on the energy broadening
model used (cf. Section 5.1.2). We here use a Lorentzian function with 0.2-ps

intraband scattering time, which results in good agreement with transmission
measurements [253].
The degeneration of heavy- and light-hole levels in our quantum wells
is accompanied by an enhanced interaction of both particles. This interaction
causes a substantial deformation of the valence subbands (valence band mixing).
Figure 10.3 shows the resulting nonparabolic shape of the valence bands; i.e., the
effective mass model of parabolic bands cannot be applied here. The fundamental
absorption edges in Fig. 10.2 are dominated by the ﬁrst subbands (HH1, LH1);
higher subbands cause additional steps in the absorption spectrum.
Band-to-band absorption can be understood as negative gain (cf. Chap. 5).
Both the gain g and the refractive index nr change with the average quantum well
carrier concentration N.The ratio of these changes gives the chirp factor (linewidth
enhancement factor)

A slightly negative chirp factor is ideal for digital ﬁber optic communication
systems [254]. It is typically between 4 and 6 for semiconductor lasers, while
it is close to 0 or even negative for electroabsorption modulators. Figure 10.4
compares both cases for our quantum well. High carrier concentrations are typical

for laser diodes, and they do not allow for negative chirp factors. Modulators
are reverse biased and exhibit a much lower carrier concentration in the quantum
wells. In Fig. 10.4, the transition wavelength to negative chirp factors is about
1.52 µm, which is near the absorption peak (cf. Fig. 10.2). Since the modulator
rather operates in the tail region of the absorption spectrum, our chirp factor is
expected to be slightly positive.
The energy band diagram of the multiquantum well active region is plotted in
Fig. 10.5 at zero bias, indicating a signiﬁcant built-in electrostatic ﬁeld. Including
the undoped InP regions, the total intrinsic region thickness of the pin structure
is about 370 nm. Figures 10.6 and 10.7 show the internal ﬁeld and the conduction
band edge, respectively, for different applied voltages. At 1V forward bias, the
MQW ﬁeld vanishes and the band edges are ﬂat. At reverse bias, the internal ﬁeld
approaches 105 V/cm.

Optical Waveguide
Our device utilizes a ridge structure for waveguiding with a 2-µm-wide ridge
etched beyond the intrinsic region. The fundamental optical mode is shown in
Fig. 10.8 for half of the device cross section. The narrow ridge gives a more
circular mode proﬁle for better coupling to optical ﬁbers. The vertical refractive

index proﬁle is plotted in Fig. 10.9 together with the mode intensity. The optical
conﬁnement factor is o = 0.2. Stronger vertical conﬁnement is desired for low
voltage operation; however, it causes higher ﬁber-coupling losses. The optical
model includes absorption losses by free carriers that are roughly proportional to
the carrier concentration and only relevant in p-doped regions (αp = kpp with
kp = 25 × 10−18 cm2). Figure 10.9 shows the resulting free-carrier absorption
proﬁle. Due to the small overlap with the optical mode, the corresponding modal
loss is only 1.5 cm−1. Additional optical losses are caused by photon scattering at
the rough sidewalls of the etched waveguide; however, scattering losses are hard to
calculate. The strongest contribution to the modal optical loss in our device results
from the residual band-to-band absorption within the quantum wells (Fig. 10.2).

overlap of the optical modes of ﬁber and modulator. The facet reﬂectance R is
kept low by antireﬂection coating. In our case, the optical loss at each facet is

zero bias, the residual transmission is 4.5 × 10−3(−23 dB). A bias of −1V gives
3 × 10−5 transmission (−45 dB), corresponding to an extinction ratio of 0.0066
(−22 dB). These numbers change with the wavelength. The wavelength sensitivity
of electroabsorption modulators depends on the distance to the absorption edge.
In our case, it is small for wavelengths below 1530 nm and above 1570 nm. For
three wavelengths near the absorption edge, Fig. 10.11 displays the transmission
as a function of voltage. As discussed above, the transmission is reduced with
higher reverse voltage. Longer wavelengths experience less absorption at any
given bias. At 1540 nm, the highest possible transmission is below 10−3, and
saturation occurs at stronger reverse bias as the absorption plateau is reached
(cf. Fig. 10.10). The comparison between the TE and TM modes in Fig. 10.11
illustrates that the polarization sensitivity depends on wavelength and bias.
TheﬁrstderivativedT/dV isgiveninFig.10.12.At1560 nm,thesteepestslope
of T(V ) occurs at about −1V reverse voltage, which gives the highest efﬁciency
of analog modulation. Shorter wavelengths experience less efﬁcient modulation.
For 1550 nm, the optimum bias is close to 0V. The low modulation efﬁciency
and the low total transmission disqualify 1540 nm as a usable wavelength for this
device.

Linearity is another main requirement in analog applications of electroabsorp-
tion modulators. Both the second derivative d2T/dV 2 and the third derivative
d3T/dV 3 of the transmission function T(V ) should be as small as possible.
However, this is hard to achieve at the same bias as shown in Fig. 10.13.
At 1550-nm wavelength, dT2/dV 2 is zero near −0.2V; however, the third
derivative is close to a maximum at this bias. A zero third derivative at
0.1V forward bias is accompanied by a relatively small second derivative.
Thus, for 1550-nm signal wavelength, the optimum region for analog opera-
tion with our device seems to be near zero bias. Signals at 1560 nm experi-
ence slightly higher transmission and modulation efﬁciency but also stronger
nonlinearity.

Amplification
Photodetector
The concept of waveguide photodetection with integrated ampliﬁcation is
evaluated by two-dimensional device simulation. A bulk GaAs photodetector
region is combined with GaAs quantum wells for ampliﬁcation. The current
ﬂow in the three-terminal device is analyzed. The net optical gain is calculated
for different waveguide modes, identifying the preferred mode of operation.
For this mode, the detector responsivity is shown to scale with the device
length, reaching a quantum efﬁciency larger than 100%.
11.1
Introduction
The purpose of any photodetector is to convert light (photons) into electric current
(electrons). Photodetectors are among the most common optoelectronic devices;
they automatically open supermarket doors, detect the signal from infrared remote
controls, and record pictures in modern cameras. Photodetectors are fabricated
from various semiconductor materials, since the band gap needs to be smaller than
the energy of the photons detected. Photon absorption generates electron–hole
pairs which are subsequently separated by the applied electrical ﬁeld. Depending
on the desired use, photodetectors are designed in many different ways. We inves-
tigate here a waveguide photodetector that looks similar to an in-plane laser, only
the light is injected through the antireﬂection coated front facet of the waveguide.
The electrical ﬁeld is applied in the vertical direction so that photon ﬂux and
carrier ﬂux are perpendicular to each other. Such devices are suitable for high
data-rate applications since thin absorption layers allow for short transit times of
the generated carriers. The detection efﬁciency can be increased by using long
waveguides. Ideally, every photon should generate one electron–hole pair, giving
100% quantum efﬁciency. However, only a small fraction of the optical signal
is usually converted into an electrical signal. To obtain stronger electrical out-
put power, the optical input power may be increased by preampliﬁcation. This
method is limited by saturation effects, as intense light leads to a large carrier
concentration in the absorption layer, which changes the behavior of the detector.
A solution to this problem was recently proposed by integrating the detector and
ampliﬁer [255].

CHAPTER 11. AMPLIFICATION PHOTODETECTOR
Figure 11.1: Cross section of the ampliﬁcation photodetector (D, detector contact;
G, ground contact; A, ampliﬁer contact).
The ampliﬁcation photodetector simultaneously ampliﬁes and absorbs the
incoming light. The schematic cross section of such a device is shown in Fig. 11.1.
The top GaAs ridge is the detecting layer, all other semiconductor layers exhibit a
larger band gap. Light ampliﬁcation is provided by multiple GaAs quantum wells.
The ampliﬁer pn-diode is operated at forward bias, whereas the detector diode
is reverse biased. Electrical and optical conﬁnement in the center of the device
is provided by the ridge–waveguide structure as well as by lateral oxidation. The
continuous ampliﬁcation of the optical wave makes it possible to maintain a con-
stant optical power along the waveguide despite the absorption. With long devices,
much higher output power than in conventional photodetectors can be achieved.
Details of the device design are evaluated in the following using two-dimensional
APSYS simulations.

Device Structure and Material Properties
The layer structure of the device is listed in Table 11.1. Refractive index data
for AlGaAs are obtained from the Afromowitz model described in Section 4.2.2.
Oxidation layers exhibit a highAl mole fraction, which lowers the refractive index.
The vertical index proﬁle is plotted in Fig. 11.2 together with several vertical
waveguide modes. The behavior of these optical modes will be analyzed in the
next section. Lateral mode conﬁnement is provided by the top ridge as well as by
the oxide layers. A value of 1.7 is used for the refractive index of aluminum oxide.
The width of the oxide aperture is set equal to the ridge width of 2 µm.
The AlxGa1−xAs system converts from a direct semiconductor for x < 0.42
to an indirect semiconductor for x > 0.42 (see Fig. 2.16). Our device contains

both types of materials. The hole transport is hardly affected by this transition.
However, most electrons entering the n-doped oxidation layers are transferred
from the  valley into the X side valley of the conduction band. Due to the
high Al mole fraction, a negligible number of electrons are still traveling in the
 valley. Thus, the lower band edge is used in calculating the carrier transport
across heterointerfaces. The common band offset ratio of Ec/Eg = 0.65 is
employed at all interfaces. Figure 11.3 shows the band diagram at the vertical axis
of the device. Due to the grading and doping proﬁle used, the valence band edge
of the oxidation layers is almost ﬂat on the p-doped side, and it hardly affects the
hole injection into the multiquantum well (MQW) ampliﬁcation region. The GaAs
detector region is reverse biased.
The conduction bands of the active GaAs layers are assumed parabolic and
the nonparabolic valence bands are calculated by the two-band ⃗k · ⃗p method
(cf. Section 2.2). Quantum well gain spectra are plotted in Fig. 11.4 for different
carrier concentrations (cf. Section 5.1.2). At 840-nm wavelength, ampliﬁer gain
on the order of gamp = 2000 cm−1 is anticipated for the TE mode. For low carrier
concentration (reverse bias), the calculated absorption spectrum of the bulk GaAs
layer is also shown in Fig. 11.4, and it is in good agreement with the experimental
data in Fig. 4.4. At 840-nm wavelength, the absorption coefﬁcient is αdet ≈
6000 cm−1. The total ampliﬁcation layer thickness of 32 nm is much smaller than

the absorption layer thickness of 300 nm. Thus, optical waveguide modes that
exhibit little overlap with the detector region are preferred.

Waveguide Mode Analysis
Three main vertical modes of our device are shown in Fig. 11.2, and mode 2 is
given as a 2D contour plot in Fig. 11.5. Mode 1 is mainly located in the detector
region, mode 3 peaks in the ampliﬁer region, and mode 2 does not show much
overlap with any active layer. The optical conﬁnement factors of these three modes
are given in Table 11.2 for both active regions. The total modal gain of each mode
can be estimated as
gmode = ampgamp −detαdet.
(11.1)
The normalized optical power in the travel direction is given in Fig. 11.6 for all
three modes. Mode 1 is completely absorbed after a short travel distance. Mode 3
also suffers from net absorption. Only mode 2 exhibits positive gain. Therefore,
we focus on mode 2 in the following.

density at IA = 20 mA ampliﬁer current, VD = −1V detector voltage, and

Positive gain is needed to overcome all other optical losses, e.g., photon scattering
losses, which are assumed to be 5 cm−1.
Many different waveguide modes may be excited by coupling light into the
device, e.g., from an optical ﬁber. Most of these modes are quickly absorbed by

the thick detector region. Only those modes are useful in our device for which
about the same number of photons is generated in the quantum wells and absorbed
in the detector. This transfer of photons is the basic idea of the ampliﬁcation
photodetector. Photons multiplied by stimulated emission stay within the same
mode.Thus, in our device example, the incoming signal needs to be mainly coupled
into modes guided by the lower cladding layers, similar to mode 2.
11.4
Detector Responsivity
In our 2D simulation, we now investigate the detector’s response to waveguide
mode 2 for the special case of constant longitudinal mode power (IA = 21 mA).
Figure 11.8 shows a vector plot of the current density distribution at low optical
power (P2 = 10 mW, VD = −1V). The plot reveals current crowding at the edges
of the oxide aperture as well as lateral current leakage within the MQW ampliﬁer
region. The detector generates about ID ≈5 mA current, which is still smaller
than IA so that the ampliﬁer dominates the direction of the current ﬂow at the
ground contact.This situation changes with higher modal power.At P2 = 100 mW,
the detector current is close to 50 mA, and the current ﬂow at the ground electrode
reverses (cf. Fig. 11.5).

Figure 11.8: Vector plot of the current density at IA = 21 mA ampliﬁer current
and P2 = 10 mW modal power (the size of the arrows scales with the current
density).
Figure 11.9 plots the photocurrent as a function of the modal power for two
different detector lengths L. Due to its little overlap with the absorption layer, mode
2 shows a very linear slope without any detector saturation effect up to 100-mW
input power.1 The detector responsivity is dID/dP = 0.46 A/W at L = 300 µm,
and it is twice as high with double the device length. The quantum efﬁciency is
given by
ηdet = dID

and it surpasses 100% for L > 440 µm in our case (¯hω/q = 1.476W/Aat 840-nm
wavelength). 200% efﬁciency would be reached with L = 880 µm, i.e., each
incident photon then generates on average two electron-hole pairs in the detector
layer, due to photon multiplication in the ampliﬁer region.
1Saturation effects depend on the longitudinal position and require 3D simulations.

Note that complex numbers are artiﬁcial constructions for mathematical conve-
nience. Any real physical quantity is represented by a real number which can be
the real part a or the imaginary part b of a complex number (cf. Section 4.2).
B.4
Bessel Functions
Bessel functions are solutions to the Bessel differential equation for the function
f (x)
x2 d2f
dx2 + x df
dx + (x2 −n2)f = 0,
(B.29)
which appears, for instance, in the analysis of cylindrical optical waveguides [256].
Bessel functions can be used to describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds of waveguide
modes. For integer n, they are given by
Jn(x) =
∞

m=1
(−1)m  x
2
n+2m
m!(n + m)!
(B.30)
with integer m and
m! = 1 × 2 × · · · × (m −1) × sm.
(B.31)
Some Bessel functions are plotted in Fig. B.2 (cf. Section 8.6).

Fourier Transformation
The Fourier integral transformation of the function f (x) is commonly given by
F(k) =
1
√
2π
 ∞
−∞
dx f (x) exp(ikx),
(B.32)
and its inverse by
f (x) =
1
√
2π
 ∞
−∞
dk F(k) exp(−ikx).
(B.33)
Both transformations are often used to translate functions from real space (x, y, z)
into ⃗k space and vice versa (cf. Section 4.13) or between time and frequency
domain.
