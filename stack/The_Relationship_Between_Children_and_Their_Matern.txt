The relationship between children and their maternal uncles in contemporary Mosuo 
culture reveals a unique parenting mode in a matrilineal society. This study compared the 
responses of Mosuo and Han participants from questionnaires on the parent–child and 
maternal uncle–child relationship. More specifically, Study 1 used Inventory of Parent and 
Peer Attachment (IPPA) to assess the reactions of the two groups to the relationship 
between children and their mothers, fathers, and maternal uncles. The results show that 
while Han people display a higher level of attachment toward their fathers than their 
maternal uncles, Mosuo people do not exhibit a significant difference in this aspect. Study 
2 used a scenario-based method to compare how adults and teenagers perceive the 
rights and responsibilities of fathers/maternal uncles toward their children/nephews or 
nieces. The results show that Han adults attribute more rights and responsibilities to their 
own children than nephews/nieces, while their Mosuo counterparts have the reverse 
pattern and assign stronger responsibilities to their nephews/nieces than their own 
children. Both groups perceive the fathers to be the bearer of rights and responsibilities, 
although this perception was weaker among Mosuo. This paper concludes that in the 
Mosuo society, fathers have a relatively weak social role as a result of their unique matrilineal 
social structure.
Keywords: attachment, parent–child relation, maternal uncle–child relation, the Mosuo, the Han
INTRODUCTION
The Mosuo (also known as the Na) is an ethnic minority group inhabiting the shores of Lugu 
Lake in southwest China, which has common borders with Yunnan Province and Sichuan 
Province. Traditionally, Mosuo’s subsistence system mainly consisted of hunting, fishing, and 
small-scale farming (Cai, 2002), though in recent decades the Mosuo society has also been 
influenced by commercialization and tourism. Ethnographically, the Mosuo is probably most 
famous for its unique marriage pattern, the walking marriage where either woman or man 
will marry the other freely. The lovers meet at woman’s house at night and the man returns 
to his own maternal family at dawn (Mathieu, 2000; Walsh, 2005), making it one of the very 
few societies where neither the males nor the females disperse after marriage (known as

Child-Maternal Uncle Relationship in Mosuo Culture
duolocal residence; Ji et  al., 2013). Ethnographic descriptions 
suggest that walking marriages involve no formal contract 
between lovers (Shih, 2008) with the indication that paternity 
is often not assured and relatively unimportant among the 
Mosuo, and multiple concurrent romantic unions are possible 
and do not invoke much jealously (Cai, 2002).
In a traditional Mosuo family, women are perceived to carry 
the blood relation among relatives and take on many important 
household responsibilities in the household, including organizing 
agricultural production, raising children, and arranging daily 
chores (Zhou, 2010). As the lovers will not set up a new 
family and do not share property. Any children resulting from 
the union of the lovers are the woman’s children and the man 
helps to raise the children of his sisters. Children live with 
their mothers, maternal uncles, grandmothers, and other maternal 
family members, and do not interact much with their biological 
fathers (Zhan et al., 2006). In line with this, men in matrilineal 
societies not only serve as the role of father and husband but 
also very importantly maternal uncle, brother, and son (Ji et al., 
2013; Wu et al., 2013). Most notably, Mosuo women’s brothers 
share the common blood tie with them and are perceived to 
belong to the same family, minimizing potential conflict of 
interest (e.g., distribution and inheritance of property). As a 
result, Mosuo men are often actively involved in assisting to 
raise their nephews and nieces. It is also worth noting that 
in traditional matrilineal societies, the dominance of father or 
husband in the household is often absent in contrast with 
patrilineal society (Xiao et  al., 2015). Mosuo culture respects 
and emphasizes the importance of women yet at the same 
time does not suppresses their male counterparts, reaching a 
complementary 
harmony 
between 
males 
and 
females 
(Zhou, 2010).
From childhood to adulthood, individuals have different 
attachment styles affected by one’s early personal experiences 
in the environment where they grow up (Picardi et  al., 2013). 
According to theory of attachment of Bowlby (1969), a growing 
individual develops an attachment to the person who takes 
care of him/her, especially his/her mother, and such attachment 
is crucial for the children’s cognitive and emotional development. 
Although the normative aspect and universal claims of attachment 
theory have been under some debate (Röttger-Rössler, 2014; 
Keller, 2018), there are good reasons to postulate that the 
quality and the extent to which children interact with their 
caregivers (often family members) will have some effect on 
their psychology as they grow up. Traditionally, attachment 
theory centers around the interaction between an infant/child 
and her caregiver as well as the cognitive and developmental 
consequences of such interaction or lack thereof (Schore and 
Schore, 2008), and cross-cultural studies usually focus on the 
relevance and applicability of attachment theory in non-western 
societies (Röttger-Rössler, 2014). In comparison, relatively little 
attention has been paid to the underlying social and family 
structures that produce various styles of attachment. This paper 
therefore examines a particular socio-cultural context—the 
matrilineal Mosuo society in southwest China—to examine 
how family structure affects individuals’ attachment to various 
family members. In addition to biological parents, special 
attention is paid to the child’s maternal uncle whose role is 
often marginalized in patrilineal societies. Through a combination 
of psychometric tests and vignette scenarios, this paper aims 
to show that the kind of attachment children form with their 
relatives and the actions they would make in various real-life 
scenarios crucially depends on the cultural context, and a full 
understanding of the relationships among family members likely 
require knowledge of the social and family structure.
Malinowski (2005) was among the first anthropologists to 
point out the importance of men as maternal uncles in matrilineal 
societies, and subsequent anthropological research has shown 
that men in matrilineal societies often face the decision of 
splitting their investment between their own children and the 
sisters’ children, creating a potential conflict (Richards, 2015). 
Although the extent to which men are involved in raising 
their sisters’ offspring vary across matrilineal societies, men 
as maternal uncles usually exert a lot of influence in the family 
(Starkweather and Keith, 2019). Among the Mosuo, men are 
well respected by their nephew/niece and enjoys high status 
within the household. They are often the main source of 
financial income of the family and are in charge of important 
family events, such as building a new house or planning a 
funeral (Zhong, 2011). In many ways, the role Mosuo men 
play as maternal uncles resembles that of fathers/husbands in 
a typical patrilineal society.
What is perhaps surprising is that the importance of men 
as maternal uncles was very resilient to external pressures. 
From the 1950s to the 1970s, The Chinese government 
implemented a series action to force Mosuo people to adopt 
monogamy, yet according to Cai (2002), none succeeded and 
Mosuo men continued to affiliate strongly with their sisters’ 
family (and from their perspective, their own family). For the 
last decade, policy, education, modernization, and tourism, as 
external driving forces, have brought about major changes 
within the Mosuo culture, including family size, family structure, 
life style, dwellings, and so on (Feng and Xiao, 2021). In 
contemporary Mosuo societies, with the expansion of formal 
schooling and the ever-present mainstream Han culture, men’s 
role as maternal uncles is still very prominent in comparison 
with nearby ethnic groups (He, 2000), though it is possible 
that the younger Mosuo generation is more culturally similar 
to the Han.
In Mosuo society, the relationship between the child and 
his/her maternal uncle (also known as avunculate in 
anthropology) is very close. The maternal uncle takes up 
many roles in bringing up sister’s child, including passing 
on important life skills and educating the child in everyday 
circumstances (Zhou, 2010). For the children, their maternal 
uncle represents the closest and most authoritative elderly 
man, sometimes more than their own biological father. As 
such, the closeness of maternal uncle–nephew relationship 
and the relative alienation of father–child relationship are 
in sharp contrast, highlighting the uniqueness of parenting 
mode in Mosuo culture (Peng, 1997; He, 2000). However, 
the current commodity economy and mainstream Han culture 
also has impact on Mosuo society in significant ways, thus 
greatly influencing Mosuo’s traditional life mode, family

structure, and responsibility assignment. Under such influence, 
the relationship between husband and wife becomes closer 
and fathers start to take on more economical responsibility 
and the upbringing of their own children. These ongoing 
social changes inevitably affect the traditional Mosuo 
parenting mode.
Two studies were conducted to compare the Mosuo and 
the Han from the perspective of attachment and obligation, 
respectively. The present study mainly aims to answer two 
questions: (1) whether the pattern of parent–child attachment 
is affected by culture. Specifically, compared with the mainstream 
Han culture, whether there are differences in parent–child 
attachment in the Mosuo culture; (2) whether the pattern of 
parent–child obligation relation at different ages is affected by 
culture. The younger generation is supposed to be  exposed 
more to the patrilineal Han culture than the older generation, 
so, whether there are generation gaps regarding the attitudes 
on the obligation relation. An extensive interpretation of the 
results in light of the specific cultural differences between the 
Mosuo and the Han is discussed.
STUDY 1
As children’s experiences of living with their family members 
could influence their attachment (Picardi et al., 2013; Röttger-
Rössler, 2014), three styles of attachment were compared between 
the Mosuo and the Han in Study 1, namely, mother attachment, 
father attachment, and maternal uncle attachment. In the Mosuo 
families, mother and maternal uncle are co-residents of children, 
while in the Han families, mother and father are the co-residents. 
In any culture, mother attachment is always considered as the 
most important parent–child attachment relationship, which 
will be no exception in Mosuo and Han culture. The attachment 
styles were hypothesized to reflect the traditional Mosuo family 
structure and culture, highlighting the closeness of uncle–nephew/
niece relationship. At the same time, it may also be influenced 
by the contemporary social changes. For the Han participants, 
the attachment mode highlights the strong attachment with 
the father and mother, but not with maternal uncle.
Participants
The sample consisted of 317 Mosuo people (160 males and 
157 females, mean age = 16.5 ± 5.96 years) and 196 Han people 
(103 males and 93 females, mean ages = 15.16 ± 5.29 years). All 
participants are from the same local middle school and are 
proficient in Mandarin, ensuring the understanding of 
questionnaires written in Mandarin Chinese characters. The 
basic demographic variables including age, ethnicity, and gender 
were collected. The study was approved by the Scientific Research 
Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Normal University. Parents or 
legal guardians of the minors were informed of the nature 
and content of the study and gave either oral or written consent 
to allow their minor children to participate, and all the minors 
also gave their oral assent prior to participating in this study. 
All participants received a gift for completing the study.
Materials and Procedure
This paper modified the self-reported questionnaire for an 
evaluation of individuals’ early attachment to parents and 
partners according to the Inventory of Parent and Peer 
Attachment (IPPA). IPPA was designed for adolescents from 
12 to 19 years old, and it evaluates the perception of the quality 
of parent–child relationships as well as the relationships between 
adolescents and their close friends (Armsden and Greenberg, 
1987). The theory behind IPPA focuses on attachment target 
and trusting relation—the cognitive dimension (Bowlby, 1973). 
The questionnaire is divided into three sections (Mother, Father, 
and Peer sections) and three dimensions are assessed, that is, 
trust, communication, and alienation. Trust measures the level 
of mutual understanding and respect, communication refers 
to the common contents and quality of the interaction between 
an individual and his/her attaching target, and alienation refers 
to the state of being angry with the attachment subject and 
emotionally alienated, which manifests as anger, interpersonal 
isolation, and unsafe attachment (Armsden and Greenberg, 1987).
Given the purpose of this study, the Chinese version of 
IPPA translated and published by Bao and Xu (2006) was 
used and a maternal uncle attachment subscale was added. 
Each subscale has 25 items and each item is rated by means 
of a five-point Likert scale. Scores were given for levels of 
disagreement and agreement (1–5), where 1 means almost 
never or never true, 2 means not very often true, 3 means 
sometimes true, 4 means often true, and 5 means almost always 
or always true. Trust and communication questions were scored 
positively and alienation questions were scored reversely. The 
higher the total score, the higher the perceived attachment 
security. In Chinese edition of IPPA (Bao and Xu, 2006), an 
adequate internal consistency (α ≥ 0.90) for each of the subscale 
was obtained.
Participants filled in the Chinese IPPA in the classrooms 
anonymously. No discussion was allowed to ensure independence 
of responses.
Results
Reliability Analysis
To examine the reliability of the questionnaire, the internal 
consistency and stability was checked. The results are shown 
in Table  1, where the internal consistency of the three 
questionnaires reaches above 0.75, suggesting that all the three 
subscales measured the same traits. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients

of the three factors in each subscale were higher than 0.60 
and the reliability was medium.
Ethnic Differences in Attachment Types
Attachment types were designed using the IPPA classification 
rules. Score distributions were divided into lowest, middle, 
and highest third, and a rating of “low,” “medium,” or “high” 
was assigned accordingly. Scores falling at the cut points were 
designed medium security to create maximally discriminating 
low security and high security (Armsden and Greenberg, 1987; 
Vivona, 2000). Attachment types of the two ethnic groups are 
summarized in Table  2.
χ2 was used to test mother attachment with participants 
from the two different ethnicities. The result showed significant 
differences in mother attachment types for different ethnic 
types. χ2 = 16.80, p < 0.001. Regarding high security attachment 
type, Han participants have higher proportion (35.18%) than 
Mosuo counterparts (22.71%). In contrast, for low security 
attachment type, Mosuo group shows a bigger percentage 
(26.82%) over Han group (13.56%). Likewise, type of attachment 
to father was tested by χ2. Again, significant differences were 
observed in type of father attachment for different ethnic 
backgrounds. χ2 = 27.98, p < 0.001. More Han individuals (37.69%) 
than Mosuo individuals (23.35%) scored high security attachment. 
On the other hand, low attachment type has a significant 
higher percentage (29.65%) for the Mosuo than Han counterparts 
(11.05%). Results from χ2 test also show no significance in 
attachment to maternal mother among different ethnic groups 
(χ2 = 2.10, p > 0.05).
Ethnic Differences in Attachment Scores
The scores of Mosuo participants and Han participants in the 
mother attachment subscale, father attachment subscale, and 
maternal uncle attachment subscale were calculated. A two (ethnic 
groups: Mosuo group vs. Han group) by three (attachment styles: 
mother attachment vs. father attachment vs. maternal uncle 
attachment) mixed-model ANOVA was conducted (see Figure 1). 
A main effect of ethnic groups was revealed, F (1,511) = 19.01, 
p < 0.001, η2 = 0.04. Mosuo group marked a significant lower score 
than Han groups. A main effect of attachment styles was also 
significant, F (2,1022) =169.55, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.25. Multiple 
comparison confirmed that attachment to mother was the strongest 
(with average score of 4.74 out of 5), second to which was father 
attachment (with average score of 4.52), and attachment to maternal 
uncle was the weakest among the three (with average score of 
4.14). The interaction effect of ethnic group and the attachment 
type was also significant, F (2,1022) =21.11, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.04. 
Simple effect analysis demonstrated that Mosuo’s attachment to 
mother (M ± SD = 4.59 ± 0.87) significantly scored higher than father 
(M ± SD = 4.37 ± 0.84) or maternal uncle (M ± SD = 4.43 ± 0.79). 
Notably, no significant difference between attachment to father 
and maternal uncle was observed. Han participants had a similar 
pattern of significance between the score of attachment to mother, 
father, and maternal uncle. However, the Han group recorded 
higher score of both mother and father attachment than the 
Mosuo group. In contrast, Mosuo group displayed a significantly 
higher score of attachment to maternal uncle (M ± SD = 4.43 ± 0.79) 
over Han counterpart (M ± SD = 4.13 ± 0.86), suggesting that Mosuo 
subjects exhibited similar level of attachment to father and maternal 
uncle while Han displayed a stronger attachment to father.
STUDY 2
As mentioned in Introduction, external driver factors, such as 
education, modernization, and tourism, have brought about 
significant changes in the Mosuo lifestyle in the last decade. 
In study 2, adults and juveniles are compared regarding response 
to the parent–child obligation relation, in order to reflecting 
the generation gaps between younger generation and older 
generation. The maternal uncle–nephew relationship and the 
father–child relationship are in sharp contrast in Mosuo culture, 
as revealed in Study 1. Study 2 compared both Han and Mosuo 
adult vs. juvenile groups reacting to one’s obligations as a 
father and a maternal uncle. This study hypothesized that, 
influenced by both the traditional Mosuo culture and the change 
of family structure, Mosuo adults may still favor their sisters’ 
children in assigning emotional and material resources (relatively 
speaking), Mosuo juvenile may show a similar pattern to their 
Han counterparts in their responses.

Participants
The sample in Study 2 was grouped into adults and juveniles, 
with 107 Mosuo adults (61 males and 46 females, mean 
age = 28.27 ± 7.78 years) and 116 Han adults (58 males and 58 
females, mean age = 29.74 ± 2.27 years). Meanwhile, 272 Mosuo 
juveniles in total were surveyed (124 males and 124 females 
and 24 members without clear information of gender, mean 
age = 17.34 ± 1.06 years). For the Han counterparts, 100 juveniles 
(47 males and 40 females, with 13 gender information missing, 
mean age = 16.92 ± 0.97 years) were recruited. Adults were 
recruited from Yong Ning village, Ninglang County, Yunnan 
province. Because all the participants were required to be literate 
and be  able to communicate with researchers in Mandarin 
(the national language of China), some older villagers were 
excluded. The juveniles were students from the same local 
middle school. The study was approved by the Scientific Research 
Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Normal University. All adult 
participants were informed of the nature and content of the 
study and provided either written or oral consent. Similar to 
Study 1, Parents or teachers or other legal guardians were 
informed of the nature and content of the study and gave 
either oral or written consent to allow their minor children 
to participate, and the minors also gave their oral assent prior 
to participating in the study. All participants received a gift 
for completing the study.
Materials and Procedure
A questionnaire was designed to measure how individuals 
assign rights and responsibilities with regard to father–child 
and maternal uncle–child relationship. Each situation (rights 
vs. responsibility) contains 12 specific vignettes, representing 
various common life scenarios that the participants may 
encounter.
The first set of scenario-based questionnaire was completed 
by adult participants, which mainly concerns the rights and 
responsibilities to son/daughter and maternal nephew/niece. It 
explored the right and responsibility assignment of Mosuo 
group and Han group, including adults comparing the 
responsibilities of one’s own children with nephews/nieces, and 
juveniles comparing father’s responsibilities with maternal uncle’s. 
Right and responsibility complement each other. For the purposes, 
right refers to one’s privileges granted by the society while 
responsibility refers to duties one needs to perform (usually 
to benefit the society). In this study, the adult participants 
were forced to make the decision regarding fulfilling his/her 
responsibility between X’s own child vs. his/her maternal nephew/
niece in concrete cases. An example of the responsibility category 
is as follows:
X’s son/daughter and maternal nephew/niece were 
admitted by high school. Limited by 260 financial 
budget, X could only support one of them to go to high 
school. Who do you think X 261 would be more likely 
to support?
An example of the right category is as follows:
X is a well-known carpenter with great craftsmanship. 
Who do you think X would possibly pass his skill to?
The second set of scenarios was completed by juvenile 
participants, which contains questions on father and maternal 
uncle’s rights and responsibilities. The juvenile participants were 
similarly forced to make the decision between father vs. maternal 
uncle regarding their responsibility. An example of the 
responsibility is below:
X became the main breadwinner of the family when he 
grew up. Which elderly would X more likely to support?
An example of the right is below:
X bought many gifts with his first-month salary. Who 
do you think would be more likely to receive the more 
valuable gift?
In this scenario-based vignette study, participants were 
presented with a booklet containing specific scenarios with 
dilemmas and were asked to make a forced decision. Basic 
demographic information including age, ethnicity, gender was 
collected, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all participants.
Results
The Adult Participants’ Forced Choices to the 
First Series Scenarios
Among the first set of scenarios, Scenario 1, Scenario 5, Scenario 
6, and Scenario 9 are broken into responsibilities, and the 
other eight scenarios are broken into rights. The average counts 
of responses are recorded from adults’ forced choices, which 
show the attitudes regarding what the protagonists should 
choose in the context concerning rights and responsibilities 
between their own children and their sister’s children. A χ2 
test was performed between Mosuo group and Han group 
responses. The results showed that adult participants’ choice 
between their son/daughter and maternal nephew/niece 
significantly differed between the Mosuo and the Han in both 
rights (χ2 = 55.32, p < 0.001) and responsibilities scenarios 
(χ2 = 58.47, p < 0.001).
In general, a similar percentage of Mosuo participants gave 
rights to their own children and their nephews/nieces. In 
contrast, significantly more Han participants chose to favor 
their own children. For example, in scenario 1, close to half 
(45%) of Mosuo participants chose to support their own 
children to study when financial resources are limited and 
this proportion reaches 90% in the Han group. In Scenario 
10, 54% Mosuo participants chose maternal nephews/nieces 
to pass on the ancestral treasures, while only 3% Han 
counterparts made the same choice. In fact, in all scenarios, 
the Han participants were more likely to assign rights and 
responsibilities to their own children than nephews/nieces, 
sometimes significantly so.
The average percentage of choice favoring one’s nephew/
niece on rights and responsibilities was calculated, respectively.

A two (ethnic groups: Mosuo group vs. Han group) by two 
(obligation styles: rights vs. responsibilities) mixed-model 
ANOVA was conducted. A main effect of ethnic groups was 
revealed, 
F 
(1,221) = 177.28, 
p < 0.001, 
η2 = 0.44. 
Mosuo 
participants had a significant higher proportion choosing the 
option favoring maternal nephew/niece (0.59) than Han 
participants (0.11). A main effect of obligation styles was also 
significant, F (1,221) = 7.18, p < 0.05, η2 = 0.03, meaning the 
average proportion of individuals picking the choice favoring 
maternal nephew/niece (0.37) was significantly higher than that 
to the responsibility (0.33). The interaction between ethnic 
groups and rights and responsibilities was not significant, F 
(1,221) = 0.02, p > 0.05. The further ethnic differences on rights 
and responsibilities are shown in Figure  2.
The Juvenile Participants’ Forced Choices to the 
Second Series Scenarios
Among the second set of scenarios, the first four scenarios 
involved the rights for the father and maternal uncle, and the 
other eight scenarios involved their responsibilities for father 
and maternal uncle. The results of juvenile participants were 
analyzed similarly to those of adult participants. There is the 
general trend that most of juveniles in both ethnicities chose 
father to take on both rights and responsibilities. χ2 test showed 
that significant ethnic differences on responsibilities (χ2 = 5.00, 
p < 0.05), and the ethnic differences on rights were marginal 
significant (χ2 = 3.39, p = 0.07). In all eight scenarios concerning 
responsibilities, the proportion of Han group choosing father 
(83.88%) was higher than that of Mosuo group (74.86%).
The average percentage of choice favoring one’s father or 
maternal uncle on rights and responsibilities was calculated, 
respectively. A two (ethnic groups: Mosuo group vs. Han group) 
by two (obligation styles: rights vs. responsibilities) mixed-
model ANOVA was conducted. A main effect of ethnic groups 
was revealed, F (1,370) = 12.49, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.03. The Mosuo 
participants had a significant higher proportion of picking 
choices favoring the maternal uncle (0.26) than their Han 
participants (0.15). The main effect of obligation styles [F 
(1,370) = 0.04, p > 0.05] and the interaction between ethnic 
groups and rights and responsibilities [F (1,370) = 0.55, p > 0.05] 
were not significant. The further ethnic differences on rights 
and responsibilities are shown in Figure  3.
DISCUSSION
The results support the hypothesis that there exist significant 
attachment style differences between the Mosuo and the Han 
participants. Specifically, in both groups attachment to mother 
exceeded the other two attachment styles. Several studies from 
different cultures support view of Bowlby (1969) that attachment 
and maternal behaviors are species characteristic adaptations 
(Ainsworth and Marvin, 1995; De Wolff and van IJzendoorn, 
1997; Posada, 2013). The Mosuo showed no difference in levels 
of attachment with fathers and with maternal uncles, while the 
Han displayed a markedly stronger attachment with fathers than 
that with maternal uncles. Additionally, the Han group exhibited 
higher level of attachment for both parents than the Mosuo group. 
The Mosuo group, on the other hand, scored higher in attachment 
to maternal uncles than in attachment to fathers. There were no 
systematic sex differences in subjects’ attachment scores.
This study contributes to the growing literature of examining 
the cultural determinants in psychological and behavioral 
outcomes (Henrich et al., 2010). A series of studies have found 
that the cognition of kinship is affected not only by language 
(Zhang and Chen, 2004a), but also by individual experience 
(Zhang and He, 2004b; Xiao et al., 2010), cultural background, 
and circumstance (Zhang et  al., 2013). The above results can 
be satisfactorily explained by the cultural contexts, in particular, 
family structure differences in two ethnic groups. In a Mosuo 
household, the role of the mother features prominently in the 
family from the child’s perspective, and the maternal uncle 
also enjoys high status as blood relative of the mother. A Mosuo 
family typically includes members bound by the ties of maternal 
kin. Grandmothers, maternal granduncles, mothers, mothers’ 
siblings, and children live in the same household (Cai, 2002; 
Shih, 2008). Mosuo children are raised by the maternal household, 
and children’s father is often excluded from the household. 
Maternal uncles play an important male role in the household. 
The Chinese old saying “the eagle holds the supreme power 
over the sky and the maternal uncle does the same but on

the land” vividly describes the privilege and the honor a maternal 
uncle holds in a traditional matrilineal family. However, in a 
Han household, father, mother, and children are often the main 
members of the nuclear family. Maternal uncle is a close relative, 
but not the main member of the family. From this point of 
view, Han culture highlights the different roles between maternal 
uncle and father in a household, which is reflected by the 
difference of children’s attachment to them.
From an evolutionary perspective, if paternity certainty is low, 
it could be in a man’s best interest to invest in his sisters’ offspring, 
to whom his relatedness is assured, rather than to raise offspring 
to whom he might be unrelated (Trivers, 1972; Alexander, 1974; 
Greene, 1978; Gaulin and Schlegel, 1980; Anderson, 2006), and 
much empirical work has shown that paternity confidence is 
positively associated with the level of paternal investment (Gaulin 
and Schlegel, 1980; Marlowe, 1999; Anderson, 2006; Anderson 
et  al., 2006; Huber and Breedlove, 2007). Among the Mosuo, it 
is possible that low paternity was induced by the specific ecological 
conditions and subsistence practices (or even social factors, such 
as increased sexual agency and partner choice), and men’s shifted 
investment toward their nephews/nieces may be  viewed as an 
adaptive response in such environments. More recently, evolutionary 
anthropologists have specifically proposed that inherited wealth 
to sons relative to daughters play a role in predicting the kinship 
structure that is, matriliny and patriliny (Holden et  al., 2003), 
which echoes the observation in the Mosuo society that wealth 
is often transferred to daughters rather than sons. Although these 
societal features are not the primarily focus for psychologists, 
they nonetheless contribute to the social–emotional interaction 
between maternal uncles and nephews/nieces, therefore affecting 
the attachment levels as measured in our studies.
The findings in the study also suggest the impact of modern 
mainstream patriarchal culture on Mosuo culture. From 1983, 
the Chinese Government encouraged the Mosuo people to 
develop tourism. People from many different cultural 
backgrounds visited the Mosuo and tourism substantially 
undermined traditional Mosuo culture. One of the results is 
the interethnic marriage. Marriage with outsiders, especially 
with the Han people, has changed the size and the structure 
of the modern Mosuo family and the relationships among 
family members. Noticeably, the size of the Mosuo family is 
becoming smaller and the Mosuo fathers increasingly take 
financial responsibility and become involved in educating 
their own children. Also, with the increased interaction between 
fathers with their children, father–child relationship has been 
greatly improved and becoming tighter. Juvenile participants 
in the current study are middle school students, most of 
whom still live in traditional matrilineal “big family” and 
only a small proportion is living in the nuclear family with 
only parents and siblings. Yet even when the fathers do not 
physically live with their children, they would frequently visit 
their own children, and as a result, the children’s attachment 
to father is becoming stronger. At the same time, the children 
also maintain very close contact with their maternal uncles. 
Therefore, the results show that children have similar types 
of relationships with their father and maternal uncle with 
regard to attachment, which partly explains the similar 
attachment scores for fathers and maternal uncles for the 
Mosuo in Study 1. Additionally, it is possible that the increased 
paternity certainty among the Mosuo in recent years as a 
result of monogamous relationships (Xiao et al., 2015) triggers 
an adaptive response for Mosuo men to invest more in their 
own children, therefore strengthening the father–child 
relationship in the family.
In the Han culture, influenced by the value that “men work 
outside and women work inside,” the mother takes the role 
of children’s daily career and communicate constantly with 
them (Levy, 2013). In contrast, father–child communication 
and interaction is relatively less. Therefore, it makes sense that 
children develop stronger trust and attachment toward their 
mother than their father. The maternal uncle is usually perceived 
to be  an “outsider” of the nuclear family, which makes their 
daily contact with the children minimal, and therefore, the 
lowest attachment score for maternal uncles is observed among 
the Han.
Some additional insight could be  gained from a deeper 
look at kin terms. Notably, in Mosuo language there is no 
linguistic distinction among biological mother, foster mother, 
stepmother, and even all of mother’s sisters. They are collectively 
referred to as “Ami,” and the word “Amizhi” and “Amiji” are 
only used to distinguish age rather than closeness (Zhan 
et  al., 2006; Xiao et  al., 2010). Research shows that “self-
reference” is one of the boundary conditions of Retrieval-
Induced Forgetting (RIF). In the Han Chinese culture, RIF 
was observed under the conditions of self-reference and 
maternal reference; while in Mosuo culture, mother’s sisters 
who are integrated in the self-concept of the Mosuo people 
are also important to such individuals (Wang et  al., 2019). 
To some extent, Mosuo people consider their mother and 
mother’s sisters as equally important, which may “dilute” the 
attachment devoted to the biological mother. In the Han 
culture, one’s biological mother and the mothers’ sisters have 
very distinct linguistic labels and are perceived quite differently 
regarding their closeness to the ego, which might explain 
why Mosuo attachment to mother is less strong in comparison 
with Han. Similarly, in the Chinese language (standard 
mandarin), the kin term “jiujiu” (maternal uncle) refers to 
mother’s brother, indicating a kind of indirect blood relationship. 
In contrast, in the Mosuo language both maternal uncle and 
biological father are referred to as “awu” (Peng, 1997), suggesting 
that the importance of maternal uncle in Mosuo culture is 
comparable to that of the father. What is perhaps more 
interesting is that calling father “awu” shows respect to the 
biological father and better contributes to the harmony of 
matrilineal family (Zhou, 2010). The results in Study 1 thus 
reflect the characteristics of specific family relationship of 
the two populations. Maternal uncle–nephew/niece relationship 
resembles that of father–son/daughter, and nicely manifests 
the uniqueness of Mosuo social and family structure. 
Interestingly, attachment to a child’s father and his/her maternal 
uncle differs from Han culture.
Results from scenario-based questionnaires in Study 2 show 
that the Mosuo adults were more likely to take on rights 
and responsibilities for their maternal nephew/niece than their

own children than their Han counterparts. For juveniles from 
both ethnicities, the majority chose father to take on rights 
and responsibilities, though this percentage is lower for 
the Mosuo.
In Mosuo family, the maternal uncle shares the responsibility 
of raising and educating the child together with the mother 
and as a result, he  enjoys the right to be  respected and given 
proper burial after death by his nephew/niece. In contrast, 
Mosuo children received rather limited financial and emotional 
input from father (this is especially true in the past), thereby 
are less responsible for their biological father when they grow 
up. In recent years, due to contact with and influence from 
the Han culture, father’s role in Mosuo family becomes 
increasingly important, as reflected in father’s input in raising 
and educating their children in the family. Therefore, attachment 
to father among younger generation becomes stronger than 
earlier times, as suggested by results in Study 2. Interestingly, 
the majority of participants in both ethnicities chose father 
to take on more responsibility than the maternal uncle, though 
the percentage of the Mosuo juveniles making the choice was 
smaller than the Han group. Among the Han, adults would 
easily prioritize their own child over nephew/niece. However, 
it was not that easy to make the choice for the Mosuo adult 
participants. During the field research, Mosuo people took 
much more time and hesitation before they made the choice 
between son/daughter and nephew/niece, suggesting maternal 
uncle’s changing role between different generations.
The typical Mosuo family nowadays mixes traditional and 
modern values, and the traditional aspect of their culture is 
met with great challenges by the process of material 
modernization and cultural homogenization (Xu, 2006). Most 
notably, the changing roles of maternal uncle and biological 
father in the family incurs severe conflicts. In general, mother 
and maternal uncle still hold more power and exert more 
influence on the children in the household yet the importance 
of the father is gradually increasing. With the increasing number 
of families adopting monogamy, father and mother start to 
share financial and educational responsibilities of their children. 
The conflicts of rights/responsibilities between the maternal 
uncle and father are very much ongoing and occurs in both 
adults and juveniles as the results have shown, but non-trivial 
generational differences are observed: juveniles are affected by 
the Han culture more than adults.
Today, Mosuo male adults are the main source of family 
income and are obliged to financially support their maternal 
uncle as he  reaches seniority. With the influence of 
monogamous Han culture, they have to at the same time 
support their own biological father. As fathers and maternal 
uncles themselves, the modern Mosuo adults are paying 
more attention to their own children and at the same time 
still connecting tightly to their maternal nephews and nieces. 
Therefore, in many cases, the modern Mosuo adults treat 
their own children and their maternal nephews and nieces 
rather similarly. It is worth re-emphasizing the point that 
modern commercial economy and the culture of monogamy 
probably have a bigger effect on Mosuo juveniles than adults, 
as the increasing importance of father in a family likely 
reshapes the father’s image in children’s mind. As more 
Mosuo individuals adopt the nuclear family structure, their 
traditional matrilineal family and the unique parenting mode 
are likely to be  disappear in the near future.
CONCLUSION
This paper presents evidence from two studies showing that 
the matrilineal Mosuo and the patrilineal Han exhibit markedly 
different levels of attachment toward maternal uncle: the Mosuo, 
due to their unique marriage and family structure, are much 
more likely to be  closely attached to their maternal uncle 
compare to the Han where the role of maternal uncle in the 
family is minimal. Additionally, the results show that Mosuo 
adults are much more likely to attribute rights and responsibilities 
to maternal uncle than their Han counterparts in a series of 
vignette scenarios, whereas much of a difference was not 
observed in Mosuo juveniles, reflecting the changing roles of 
the father/maternal uncle of the Mosuo with the cultural 
influence of the Han majority.
