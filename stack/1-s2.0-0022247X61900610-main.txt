In a previous note [l] under this title there was given a method for 
constructing 
a sequence of solid spherical harmonics 
E’,(x), the first 
few of which are 
Yi = Xi, 
Yij = XiXi - f X26ij, 
where 
x2 = x12 + X22 + x22, 
(4 
the subscripts i, j, k, . . . may each have any of the values 1, 1, or 3, and 
the parentheses enclosing s subscripts means to sum over the s ! terms 
obtained by all permutations 
of the s subscripts, and then divide by s! 
These polynomials have more recently appeared in researches in statistical 
mechanics [2] and in the quantum 
theory of angular momentum 
[3]. 
A second method for obtaining 
these polynomials 
is mentioned 
bl 
Edmonds [3] who states that the polynomials of degree s may be obtained 
by subtracting 
from the tensor xS all quantities 
which are invariant 
under orthogonal 
transformations. 
The tensor Y,(X) thus obtained is 
completely symmetric and reduces to zero when contracted on any pair 
of indices;. 
The two methods mentioned above for obtaining 
the solid spherical 
harmonics Y,(x) and the tensors Y,(x) do not afford a general representa-

tion for all s and, while straightforward 
in principle, become prohibitively 
tedious as s increases. 
In this note we give a general representation 
in 
terms of the Legendre polynomials 
P&) 
from which, for any given s, 
YJx) 
is readily obtainable. 
The Legendre polynomial 
P,( ^r - %), where 
and ^r and f are unit vectors parallel to r and x, respectively, is a surface 
spherical harmonic 
of degree s in Z. 
The solid 
spherical 
harmonic 
(rx) “I’,( ^r * Z) is a homogeneous polynomial 
of degree s in r as well as 
in x. Since (YX) “I’,( 3 . %) is invariant 
under orthogonal transformations 
and rS is a tensor of order s, we may write 
where T,(x) is a tensor of order s with components which are homogeneous 
polynomials 
of degree s in x. 
As the arbitrary 
numerical factor in the 
right hand member of (4) we have chosen the coefficient 
(2s !)/2’s !s ! of 
j”s in P,(p). 
Tensors T,(x) of order s are not uniquely 
determined by (4) above 
for, given any tensor T,(x) satisfying 
(4), we can obtain another such 
one by symmetrizing 
in any pair of indices. 
It is quite readily seen, 
however, that the desired tensor Y,(x) is the only completely symmetric 
tensor such that

(5) 
YJx) is, therefore, obtainable 
by completely 
symmetrizing 
any tensor 
T,(x) satisfying (4). Formally, the symmetrization 
is readily accomplished 
by the subscript notation 
used in (1). 
The method may be adequately illustrated 
with s = 4. Starting with
