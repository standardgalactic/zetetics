Abstract
An old problem of De Morgan leads to the observation that the number 2184 is 3
less than a power of 3 and 13 less than a power of 13. Such a number is called
“doubly absurd.” Doubly absurd numbers relate in subtle ways to the Ramanujan-
Nagell equation, Catalan’s equation and Pillai’s equation. The author conjectures
that there are only seven other doubly absurd numbers, and that 2184 is the only
one where both powers are cubes or higher exponents. Some partial progress is
made toward proving the conjecture.
1. Introduction
Augustus De Morgan, the nineteenth century’s closest analogue to Martin Gardner,
once posed this puzzle: “At one point in my life, the square of my age was the
same as the year.” What year was he born in? It seems as if there is not enough
information, until you realize that he wrote this in 1864. The only year he could
have been born in (given a normal life span) was 432 −43 = 1806, so he was 43 in
the year 1849.
The next birth years that could solve De Morgan’s puzzle (allowing higher powers
as well as squares) are 1892, 1980, 2046, 2070, 2162, 2184, 2184, ... . Notice that the
year 2184 appears twice! People born in the year 2184 will ﬁrst be able to celebrate
in 2187, when their age will be the seventh root of the year. And in case they miss
this great occasion, they will get another chance ten years later: in 2197, their age
will be the cube root of the year. (See [1] and [8] for popular expositions based on
this idea.)
Is there some explanation for this curious fact? Is 2184 the only number that
appears twice? These are the questions we will explore, and partially answer, in
this paper.
First we need some terminology.
If a number n can be written in the form
n = xa −x, we will call the number absurd (literally, “without the surd”) because it
is equal to an integer xa minus a perfect root, or surd, of that integer. Likewise, if n

INTEGERS: 18 (2018)
2
can be written as n = xa+x, we will call it an adsurd number. If a ≥3 in the above
deﬁnitions, we will say that n is strictly absurd or strictly adsurd, respectively.
Furthermore, if a number n is absurd in two di↵erent ways, i.e.,
n = xa −x = yb −y,
(1)
we will call it doubly absurd. We can deﬁne doubly strictly absurd, doubly adsurd
and doubly strictly adsurd numbers analogously. We are now prepared to say what
is (probably) unique about the number 2184.
Conjecture 1. (2184 Conjecture.) The only doubly strictly absurd number is 2184.
Likewise, it appears that there is only one doubly strictly adsurd number.
Conjecture 2. (130 Conjecture.) The only doubly strictly adsurd number is 130.
The author has not found a previous occurrence of the 130 Conjecture in the
literature. However, the question of ﬁnding doubly absurd numbers has come up
several times. The 2184 Conjecture is in fact a special case of the following more
general conjecture, which is apparently due to Mike Bennett ([2], also see [9]).
Conjecture 3. (Bennett) The eight numbers listed below are the only doubly
absurd numbers.
(i) 6 = 23 −2 = 32 −3
(ii) 30 = 25 −2 = 62 −6
(iii) 210 = 63 −6 = 152 −15
(iv) 240 = 35 −3 = 162 −16
(v) 2184 = 37 −3 = 133 −13
(vi) 8190 = 213 −2 = 912 −91
(vii) 78120 = 57 −5 = 2802 −280
(viii) 24299970 = 305 −30 = 49302 −4930.
We will call these “Bennett’s eight solutions” and refer to them by number, so
2184 is Bennett’s solution (v).
Note that we will always write solutions to (1)
with the smaller variable ﬁrst, so throughout the paper we will assume x < y and
a > b ≥2.

2. History and Heuristics
Considering that equation (1) and Conjectures 1 and 3 are not “famous,” it is sur-
prising to see what a rich history they have. In fact, there are at least three plausible
routes leading to the problem: the Moret-Blanc-Mordell thread, the Ramanujan-
Nagell-Skinner thread, and the Catalan-Pillai-Bennett-Mihailescu thread.
2.1. The Moret-Blanc Thread
Is there an integer n that can be expressed both as a product of two consecutive
numbers and as a product of three consecutive numbers? If we let the two numbers
be y −1 and y, and the three numbers be x −1, x, and x + 1, then we arrive at
equation (1) in the special case where a = 3 and b = 2.
The earliest reference to this problem that we have found is [3] from 1881. Eugene
Lionnet posed the above problem and Claude Seraphin Moret-Blanc, a high-school
teacher in Le Havre, derived the two solutions, n = 6 and n = 210 (Bennett solutions
(i) and (iii)).
Moret-Blanc’s proof was not complete; he makes an assumption of convenience
that lets him get the two stated solutions. A complete proof that 6 and 210 are the
only solutions can be found in Mordell [4]. The proof is not elementary, as it uses
the fact that a certain cubic number ﬁeld has unique factorization. Thus the case
a = 3, b = 2 of equation (1) has been completely solved, the only substantive case
that has.
2.2. The Ramanujan Thread
In 1913, Srinivasa Ramanujan conjectured that there are only ﬁve integer solutions
to the equation
2a+2 −7 = z2.
(2)
This equation is easily reduced to a special case of (1). Clearly z must be odd,
so we can write it as z = 2y −1. Substituting this into (2) and dividing by 4, we
get 2a −2 = y2 −y, which is equation (1) with x = 2 and b = 2. Two of the ﬁve
solutions, (a, y) = (1, 1) and (2, 2), are trivial, but the other three are not and they
lead to Bennett’s solutions (i), (ii) and (vi).
In 1948, Trygve Nagell proved Ramanujan’s conjecture. In 1988, Chris Skinner
(who at that time was a high-school student) replaced 2 with an arbitrary prime q
and thus considered the equation 4qa −4q + 1 = z2. In a remarkable paper for a
teenager, or indeed a mathematician of any age, Skinner [5] showed there are only
two other solutions. Combining Nagell’s and Skinner’s results, we conclude that
Bennett’s (i), (ii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) are the complete list of solutions to (1) where
x is prime and b = 2.

The main result of this paper (Theorem 1) is quite analogous to Skinner’s Theo-
rem. We will show that Bennett’s (v) is the complete list of solutions to (1) where
y is prime and b = 3. (In addition, we will have to assume a is odd).
2.3. The Catalan Thread
In 1842, Eugene Catalan conjectured that the only consecutive numbers that are
perfect powers are 8 (= 23) and 9 (= 32). That is, Catalan’s equation xa −yb = 1
has only one positive integer solution. This was ﬁnally proved by Preda Mihailescu
[6] in 2002, and is one of the landmark results in number theory so far this century.
Meanwhile, in the 1930s and 1940s, S.S. Pillai framed a generalization of Cata-
lan’s conjecture: for any constant c there are only ﬁnitely many solutions to the
equation yb −xa = c. His conjecture remains open. Bennett’s paper [2] proves the
much more modest statement that for any two ﬁxed values of x and y there are at
most two solutions to Pillai’s equation. Note that he allows exponents of 1, so one
possibility is that the two solutions are
yb −xa = y −x = c,
(3)
which is simply another version of equation (1).
In this way he arrived at his
conjectured list of eight solutions to (1).
For any readers who might wish to compare this paper with Bennett’s, it is
somewhat tricky. Although the problems we consider are very similar, the point of
view is quite di↵erent. In Bennett’s paper, x and y are thought of as parameters
and written as b and a (respectively), while a and b are thought of as variables
and written as y and x (respectively). Also, note that his target of interest is c
(in equation (3)), while ours is n (in equation (1)). For example, his Theorem 1.4
appears at ﬁrst glance to say that c cannot be too small compared to yb. In fact,
though, it says that c cannot be too small compared to the smaller of yb or y, which
is y. Speciﬁcally, his result implies that y < 6001c = 6001(y −x), or in other words
y/x > 6001/6000.
Bennett’s results are excellent in their context, but virtually orthogonal to the
problems treated in this paper. Nevertheless, the Catalan thread is extremely im-
portant for our approach to equation (1). The fundamental idea is to reduce (1)
to Catalan’s equation. As we shall see, for b > 3 this reduction is not always com-
pletely successful, and it will be very convenient to call on the extensive computer
work that has been done [7] to ﬁnd “small” solutions of Pillai’s equation.
By contrast, we have not been able to ﬁnd any prior literature on Conjecture 2,
doubly adsurd numbers, or the equation analogous to (1) with the minuses replaced
by pluses. We will merely point out here that the only two doubly adsurd numbers
less than 2 billion are 30 = 52 + 5 = 33 + 3 and 130 = 53 + 5 = 27 + 2. We hope
that some readers will be motivated to pursue this problem further.
The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the following theorem.

INTEGERS: 18 (2018)

Theorem 1. The only solution to n = xa −x = y3 −y for which x is a positive
integer, y is a prime, a > 3, and a is odd, is n = 2184.
In fact, we will prove a generalization of Theorem 1 to all b 14 (Theorem
2). The generalization, however, requires additional assumptions on a and y, so
equation (1) is far from being completely solved even for these small exponents.
Although the proof of Theorem 1 looks technical, the main idea is quite simple.
Suppose we are looking for solutions to the equation
x7 −x = y3 −y,
(4)
i.e., equation (1) with a = 7 and b = 3. We start by multiplying by x2 to get
x2(y3 −y) = x9 −x3 = m3 −m, where we have deﬁned a new variable m = x3.
Because m is “small” compared to m3 and y is “small” compared to y3, we conclude
heuristically that x2y3 ⇡m3. On the other hand, if we deﬁne j to be the integer
closest to m/y, so that jy ⇡m, then m3 ⇡j3y3. Comparing these two approximate
equations, we conclude that x2 ⇡j3.
But what does “approximately equal” mean when the variables in question are
integers? Ideally, it means the two integers di↵er by at most one. That is, x2 −j3 =
±1. But this is exactly Catalan’s equation! By Mihailescu’s theorem, it has the
unique solution x = 3, j = 2. Since jy ⇡m = x3 = 27, it’s easily seen that y must
equal 13, and thus equation (4) has the unique solution x = 3, y = 13.
The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 simply formalize the above argument and gen-
eralize it to other exponents a and b. The argument does not work at all if b = 2,
because m is not suﬃciently small compared to m2. It works extremely well if b = 3.
If b ≥4 the argument works pretty well but with some complications that force us
to look at Pillai’s equation rather than Catalan’s.
In Section 3 we will collect all the inequalities we need; this section does not
involve any number theory. In Section 4 we move to the context of integers and
prove Theorem 1 and its generalizations. Section 5 will o↵er some directions for
future research.
3. Through the Eye of the Needle
The main new tool involved in the proof of Theorem 1 is the following set of in-
equalities, which for the most part do not require x, y, a, and b to be integers. Only
when we get to Lemma 3 will we assume that b (but not the others) is an integer;
otherwise, all the variables in this section are merely assumed to be real numbers.
Lemma 1. Given that xa −x = yb −y, x > 1, y > 1, and a > b ≥3.
Let
t = (a −b)/(b −1) and let m = x1+t. Finally, let j = m/y. Then
1/x > xt −jb > 0.

Proof. Multiply both sides of equation (1) by xt, to obtain
xt(yb −y) = xa+t −x1+t = mb −m.
(6)
Equation (6) will be the starting point for all of our Lemmas as well as Theorem
1 and its generalizations. We start by establishing a few basic inequalities. First,
because xt > 1, we have mb −m > yb −y. Because f(x) = xb −x is an increasing
function on [1, 1), it follows that m > y.
Likewise, note that yb −y = (xa/b)b −x > (xa/b)b −xa/b. By the same argument
as above, y > xa/b.
Next, we point out an important dichotomy. If b2 ≥a, then
xt < ytb/a = y(ab−b2)/(ab−a) y.
(7)
If on the other hand b2 < a, then y > xa/b > xb. These are the possibilities
referred to as Case 1 (i.e., b2 ≥a and xt < y) and Case 2 (i.e., b2 < a and xb < y)
in Lemma 4, and I will continue to refer to them by those names throughout the
paper. Notice that in either case, we can say from the ﬁrst part of equation (7) that
xt < yb/(b−1).
Finally, note that (6) can be rewritten as follows: yb −y = x(mb−1 −1). Conse-
quently, we get the following inequality that will be used in Lemmas 3 and 4:
(yb −y) < xmb−1 < yb.
(8)
With the preliminaries ﬁnished, we turn to the proof of (5). We plug m = jy
into equation (6) to obtain
(xt −jb)yb = (xt −j)y = xty −m = xty −x1+t = xt(y −x) > 0.
This proves the right-hand side of (5). For the left-hand side, in Case 1 we have
(xt −jb)yb < xty < y2.
Thus
xt −jb < 1/yb−2 < 1/xb−2 1/x.
In Case 2 we have xb < y and xt < yb/(b−1) y3/2, since b ≥3. Proceeding as
above we conclude that xt −jb < 1/y1/2 < 1/xb/2 < 1/x.
Remark. Lemma 1 formalizes the idea, stated in section 1, that xt ⇡jb. Here we
had to assume that m = jy. Lemmas 2 and 3 relax this assumption to m ⇡jy (in
the speciﬁc sense of ⇡that was mentioned earlier).
Lemma 2. Given x, y, a, b, t, and m as deﬁned in Lemma 1, let j0 = (m −1)/y.
Then
(b + 1)/x > xt −(j0)b > 0.
(9)

In fact, the right-hand side of (9) can be strengthened to:

(10)
Proof. By Lemma 1, if j = m/y then 0 < xt −jb < 1/x. We note that j0 = j −1/y.
Obviously, 0 < jb −(j0)b. From the Mean Value Theorem, applied to the function
f(x) = xb with endpoints j and j0, we have jb −(j0)b < bmb−1/yb < b/x (using
(8)). Adding these inequalities, we get (9).
To improve on the lower bound, note that (j −1/y)b(j + 1/y)b < j2b, so
(j −1/y)b <
j2b
(j + 1/y)b <
jb
(1 + 1/m)b <

(1 + b/m).
We combine this with the left-hand side of (8) and do a little bit of algebra (left to
the reader) to obtain inequality (10).
Lemma 3. Given x, y, a, b, t, and m as deﬁned in Lemma 1, let j00 = (m + 1)/y.
Furthermore, assume that b is an integer. Then the following inequalities hold:

(12)
(c) If b = 3 and m ≥4, then
4/x > (j00)b −xt > 0.
(13)
Proof. We note that j00 = j + 1/y, where j = m/y. As in the proof of Lemma 2,
we can apply the Mean Value Theorem, with f(x) = xb and endpoints j and j00, to
show the right-hand side of inequality (11), (12) or (13).

By a well-known inequality (which follows from Stirling’s formula), (2b

and the left-hand side of inequality (11) follows.
In Case 2, 2b xb < y <

then (14) reduces to (j00)3 −j3 = (3 + 3/m + 1/m2)j2/y, and the expression in
parentheses is less than 4 when m ≥4. Part (c) follows.
Remark. While all three of these lemmas say that, in some sense, xt −jb ⇡0, they
actually provide very narrow windows or “eyes of the needle” that xt −jb must lie
in. We put this information to good use in the next section.
4. From Reals to Integers
In this section we will assume that x, y, a and b are all integers and start investi-
gating the consequences of the “eye of the needle” inequalities. We begin with the
proof of Theorem 1, in which we are assuming that y is prime and that b = 3.
Proof. First note that x = 2 cannot be a solution because xa −x ⌘2 (mod 4) but
y3 −y ⌘0 (mod 4). Thus we can assume x ≥3. We deﬁne the integers t and
m as in Lemma 1 (noticing that t is an integer because a is odd and b −1 = 2).
By equation (6) we see that y|(m3 −m), and therefore either y|m, y|(m + 1), or
y|(m −1). We will take the three cases in that order.
Suppose then that m = jy for some integer j > 1. Then from Lemma 1,
1 > 1/x > xt −j3 > 0.
Because x, t, and j are integers, this case leads to a contradiction.
Next, suppose that m = j0y + 1 for some integer j0. By Lemma 2,
4/x > xt −(j0)3 > 0.
Because all quantities in the equation are integers, this forces x = 3 and xt −(j0)3 =
1. If t > 1, Mihailescu’s theorem says that there is only one solution: x = 3, t = 2,
and j0 = 2. Then we have a = 3b −2 = 7, m = x1+t = 27 and y = (m −1)/2 = 13,
and we recover the solution to equation (1), 37 −3 = 133 −13. If t = 1, then we
have x = (j0)3 + 1 and x = 3, which is a contradiction.
Finally, suppose that m = j00y −1 for some integer j00 > 1. Because x ≥2 and
y > x, we have y ≥3 and therefore m ≥5. Thus by Lemma 3,
4/x > (j00)b −xt > 0.

INTEGERS: 18 (2018)

This is only solvable in integers if x = 3 and (j00)3 −xt = 1. But by Mihailescu’s
theorem the second equation has no solution if t > 1. If t = 1 then x = 3 and
x = (j00)3 −1, a contradiction.
Thus we conclude that y = 13, x = 3, a = 7 is the only integral solution to
equation (1) under the conditions of Theorem 1.
It is natural to wonder whether we can use the same approach to solve equation
(1), or rule out solutions, for other values of b. The answer is yes. First, we start
with a strengthening of Lemma 2 that holds in the integer case. The basic idea of
the proof, like everything in this section, is that the discreteness of the integers lets
us turn inequalities into equalities.
Lemma 4. Suppose that x, y, a, b, t, m and j0 are deﬁned as in Lemma 2, and
are all integers. Assume b ≥4 and j0 ≥2. Let c = xt −(j0)b. Then cx = b.
Proof. We already know from Lemma 2 that cx < b + 1. Therefore it remains only
to show that cx > b −1. Assume, for the sake of deriving a contradiction, that
cx b −1.
Lemma 2 also says that
(1 + b/m)cx > (1 −1/yb−1)b ≥(1 −1/3b−1)b.
(The latter inequality holds because y > x and x ≥2.) We substitute cx b −1
and conclude that 3b−1(1 + b/m)(b −1) > (3b−1 −1)b. This simpliﬁes to
m < 3b−1b(b −1)
3b−1 −b
,
from which it easily follows that m < b2. Because m = x1+t, it follows that xt < b2.
Then c = xt −(j0)b < b2 −2b 0, where the ﬁrst inequality uses the assumption
that j0 ≥2 and the second uses the assumption that b ≥4. This contradicts the
fact proven in Lemma 3 that c > 0.
Theorem 2. There are no integer solutions of xa −x = yb −y such that a > b, y
is prime, (b −1)|(a −1), (y −1, b −1) 2, and 4 b 14.
For example, if b = 5, Theorem 2 says that there are no solutions with y prime,
y ⌘3 (mod 4), and a ⌘1 (mod 4).
Proof. Suppose, for the sake of deriving a contradiction, that all the conditions
in Theorem 2 are true. Deﬁne t and m as in Lemma 1. Just as in Theorem 1,
y|(mb −m) and m is not a multiple of y. Therefore o(m)|(b −1) (where o(m) is the
order of m (mod y)). But also o(m)|(y −1) by Fermat’s little theorem. Because
(b−1, y−1) 2, it follows that o(m) = 1 or 2. Because y is prime, the only residues

INTEGERS: 18 (2018)
10
with order 1 or 2 are ±1. Thus m ⌘1 (mod y) or m ⌘−1 (mod y). Also, note
that if b is even then (b −1, y −1) = 1, so in that case o(m) = 1 and m ⌘1.
Accordingly we consider two cases, ﬁrst where m ⌘1 (mod y). In this case, there
is an integer j0 ≥1 such that m = j0y + 1. If j0 = 1, then y = m −1 = x1+t −1. By
hypothesis, y is prime, and this is only possible if x = 2. By Lemma 2, 2c = cx <
b + 1 15, so c 7. In addition, 2t −1 = c, from which we conclude that c must
equal 1, 3, or 7. Then (a −b)/(b −1) = t = 1, 2, or 4. Thus, equation (1) reduces
to one of the following three possibilities: 22b−1 −2 = 3b −3, 23b−2 −2 = 7b −7, or
25b−4 −2 = 31b −31. We leave it to the reader to show that none of these equations
has an integer solution b ≥4.
Thus we can assume henceforth that j0 ≥2, and apply Lemma 4. As in that
lemma, let c = xt −(j0)b. Then, by Lemma 5, cx = b, so we get the remarkable
equation
xt −(j0)cx = c.
(15)
If t = 1, then 14 ≥b ≥x = c + (j0)b ≥1 + 24 = 17, a contradiction. Thus we may
assume that t > 1. In that case, by Mihailescu’s theorem, c = xt −jb > 1. Thus
2 c, x 7. It is easy to show that c and x are relatively prime, so there are only
eight possibilities: (x, c) = (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), (2, 7), (7, 2), (3, 4) or (4, 3).
Although we could go through the eight cases one by one, it is more interesting
to give an approach with greater generality.
Suppose x = p and c = 2, where p is an odd prime. Then (j0)2p ⌘−2 (mod
p2). Thus 2p−1 ⌘(−2)p−1 ⌘(j0)2p(p−1) ⌘1 (mod p2), where the last step follows
because the order of the multiplicative group (mod p2) is p(p−1). This means that
p is a Wieferich prime! Only two such primes are known: p = 1093 and p = 3511,
and any further Wieferich primes are at least 4.9 ⇥1017. Of course, for our proof it
is suﬃcient to note that 3, 5, and 7 are not Wieferich primes.
Similarly, suppose x = 2 and c = p, where p is an odd prime. If t is even, the
left side of equation (15) factors, and we easily get a contradiction. Thus t must
be odd. Then, reducing (15) modulo p and using Fermat’s little theorem, we have
(j0)2 ⌘(j0)2p ⌘2t (mod p). Thus 2t is a quadratic residue (mod p); hence 2 is a
quadratic residue (mod p), and by the Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem, p ⌘1 or 7
(mod 8). In particular, p cannot be equal to 3 or 5.
If x = 2 and c = 7, the above congruence argument does not help. However, we
have a delightful surprise: equation (15) reduces to 2t −[(j0)7]2 = 7. This is just
the Ramanujan-Nagell equation, discussed in section 1! In particular, we conclude
that (j0)7 = 1, 3, 5, 11, or 181, the ﬁve solutions to the Ramanujan-Nagell equation.
The possibility j0 = 1 was ruled out earlier, and the other four possibilities are not
seventh powers. Thus we have a contradiction.
The cases x = 4, c = 3 and x = 3, c = 4 lead to contradictions by similar con-
gruence arguments (with no need to call upon advanced theorems). This completes
the proof of Theorem 2 in the case where m ⌘1 (mod y).

Now we consider the other possibility, which is that m ⌘−1 (mod y). In this
case, there is an integer j00 > 1 such that m = j00y −1.
Recall from the ﬁrst
paragraph of the proof that b must be odd.
Here we can apply Lemma 3. First, if a > b2, we set as usual
c = (j00)b −xt
(16)
and note that b + 1 > cx > b −1. Thus cx = b 14. By Mihailescu’s theorem
c > 1. Thus b is an odd composite number less than 14, which means that b = 9
and c = x = 3. But then (j00)b = 3t + 3, which is impossible because the right-hand
side is divisible only once by 3.
Hence we can assume that a b2, and we note that this also means that t b.
It is easy to rule out t = b because we can factor the right-hand side of (16) (details
again left to the reader). Thus we can assume that t b −1.
At this point, the argument gets a little bit messy because we have to use the
upper bound in Lemma 3(a), which is much worse than the one in Lemma 3(b).
However, we also have the beneﬁt of massive computer calculations that have been
done to identify small solutions (in c) to the equation (j00)b−xt = c, Pillai’s equation.
Speciﬁcally, sequence A076427 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and
the linked table at [7], lists all of the solutions to this equation for which c 100
and for which the two powers, (j00)b and xt, are less than 1018. As it turns out, the
table is suﬃcient to solve our problem for b 13.
We will leave the easier cases, b = 5, 7, and 9, to the reader and give the proof
in the two most diﬃcult cases, b = 11 and 13.
Suppose that b = 11. Note that x = 2 can never be a solution to (1) when b is
odd, by a congruence argument (mod 4). Thus x ≥3 and y ≥5 (remembering that
y is a prime greater than x). We also know that m ≥2y−1 ≥9. Applying equation
(11), we conclude that (j00)b −xt = c, where cx < 105.5. Because x ≥3, we have
c 35, which puts it within the range of table [7]. Also because c ≥2, we have
x 52, so xt 5210 < 1.4 ⇥1017, so xt and (j00)b are also within the range of the
table. Thus equation (16) must appear among the 274 known solutions of Pillai’s
equation in table [7]. But none of those solutions involves an eleventh power, so we
have a contradiction.
The case b = 13 requires a little extra work. First, we can rule out x = 3 by
reducing equation (1) modulo 9, and we can rule out x = 4 by reducing equation
(1) modulo 8. Hence any solution to (1) must have x ≥5, y ≥7 and m ≥13. Now
Lemma 3 says that cx 263.1. Because x ≥5, c 52, which puts c within the
range of table [7]. Also, if x 31, then xt < 3112 < 1018, which puts xt and (j00)b
within the required range as well.
Now if x ≥32, then y is a prime greater than x, so y ≥37 and m ≥73. We can
recompute the upper bound (9) with the new value of m and we ﬁnd that cx < 44.4.
This is already a contradiction, because c ≥2 and x ≥32.

Thus x 31 and so c, x, and j00 must appear among the 274 known solutions of
Pillai’s equation in table [7]. However, none of those solutions involve a thirteenth
power, and so we arrive at our ﬁnal contradiction.
While the last part of the proof of Theorem 2 is inelegant, the main point is that,
when m ⌘−1 (mod p), we were able to place an upper bound on t, depending on
b. Thus the search for solutions was reduced to a ﬁnite, albeit large, calculation.
Fortunately, that calculation was already done for us!
5. Ideas for Future Study
In this ﬁnal section, we will leave the reader with two unsolved problems.
1) Prove Conjecture 2. That is almost certainly too hard, but it would be in-
teresting to see if analogues of Theorems 1 and 2 can be proven for doubly adsurd
numbers.
2) Prove Theorem 1 without the assumption that a is odd, or prove Theorem 2
without the extra assumptions that (b−1)|(a−1) and (y −1, b−1) 2. As it turns
out, when b = 3 the ﬁrst two even cases are quite easy, but the arguments do not
seem to generalize to even numbers a ≥8.
Theorem 3. If a = 4 or 6, then the equation xa −x = y3 −y has no integer
solutions for which x > 1 and y is a prime.
In fact, the proof given below works just as well with the weaker hypothesis that
x and y are relatively prime.
Proof. If x6 −x = y3 −y and x, y > 1, note that f(y) = y3 −y is increasing, with
f(x2) < x6 −x and f(x2 + 1) > x6 −x. Hence x2 < y < x2 + 1, which is impossible
if y is an integer.
The proof for a = 4 starts in the same way. Suppose that x4 −x = y3 −y, where
y is prime. As above, it is easy to verify that x4/3 < y < x4/3 + 1. Also notice that
(y −x)(y2 + xy + x2 −1) = y3 −x3 −y + x = x4 −x3,
from which we conclude x3|(y −x)(y2 + xy + x2 −1). Because x < y and y is
prime, it follows that x is relatively prime to y, and hence x3 is relatively prime to
(y −x). It follows that x3|(y2 + xy + x2 −1). Now suppose, for the sake of deriving
a contradiction, that x ≥8, so that x−1/3 1/2. Then, because y < x4/3 + 1,
1
x3 (y2 + xy + x2 −1) < x−1/3 + x−2/3 + x−1 + 2x−5/3 + x−2 < 1.
It is impossible for (y2 + xy + x2 −1) to be a multiple of x3 and yet be less than
x3. So, by contradiction, we conclude that x < 8. But it is easy to verify that
y3 −y = x4 −x has no integer solution if x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
