Builders want solutions that help them stay on schedule and maintain quality construction and profits. When
compared to traditional joist construction, manufactured wood floor truss systems are better, stronger, and can be
installed faster. A manufactured truss is an engineered structural component assembled from wood members,
metal connector plates and other mechanical fasteners. The truss members form a rigid structural framework and
are assembled such that the members form triangles. Most builders are familiar with roof truss systems, but may
not realize the advantages of a manufactured floor truss system.
The benefits of manufactured wood truss floor systems are many. Floor trusses can span great distances, creating
larger open spaces below unobstructed columns and partitions. Truss systems are quicker and easier to install
than traditional floor joists, and because they're manufactured in controlled environments, there's less chance of
warping, shrinking, and twisting of lumber. Manufactured floor truss systems also save timber resources by
reducing the amount of wood waste generated during construction.

The component manufacturing process is simple and offers the professional builder plenty of time- and cost-
saving resources along the way. Here's how it works:
House plans are sent by the builder to the wood floor truss manufacturer. There are hundreds of truss
manufacturers operating nationwide, but builders should research the quality and delivery costs before choosing a
vendor.
The building designer determines what loads need to be supported by the floor trusses. Then the truss designer
determines how many trusses will be required, and their specific placement on the structure. The manufacturer
then builds the trusses, labels them for accurate installation, and ships them to the builder on the jobsite.
A detailed diagram with the placements of the trusses is sent along with the order to help the builder place the
trusses exactly where they should be installed.
Once the trusses are on the site, the builder can really start to see the benefits. The consistent size and height of the
manufactured floor joist will mean easier sub-floor material installation, and the open web design allows for utilities
to be run through in the floor system without drilling or cutting holes. These benefits will reduce the amount of time
trade contractors spend on site, speed up construction, and ultimately save the builder money. The technology
used in the design and manufacturing of floor trusses makes them a superior choice for builders looking to
streamline construction and provide a higher quality home to their customers.

Floor trusses are delivered to your site, ready for
installation. No cutting or fitting is required. Strong,
lightweight and rigid “System 42” Floor Trusses go
up easily and quickly. Often without the use of a
crane. Expensive steelworkers, welders or riggers
are not required. Your crew can do it all.
Decking and ceiling materials are attached directly
to trusses without need for special hardware. And
because System 42 trusses can be spaced wider apart,
less trusses are required resulting in less nails to drive.
Mechanicals are installed quickly through the open webs without
notching or furring. Electricians, A/C contractors and plumbers are off the
job quicker.
System 42 provides longer clear spans providing exceptional design flexibility. For
this reason, plus their cost saving benefits during construction, more and more
architects are specifying System 42 Floor Trusses than ever before.

The Benefits of
Floor truss are built with open chases for ductwork and have natural open spaces for plumbing and electrical wiring.
Floor truss systems are sometimes called System 42's, because to build them manufacturers turn the 2x4's on their
side. This allows for shallow depths as well as a 3 1/2" nailing surface. Some floors are built from 2x3's, others from
2x4's. Floor trusses can be manufactured with many different possible end conditions to accommodate different
installation needs; around raised walls, pocketed beams, headers around stairways, etc.
Is it OK to move a floor truss? Typical floor trusses are engineered to be spaced evenly, and the truss design
drawing verifies the required truss spacing. Occasionally the need will arise to shift one of the floor trusses from
where it was designed to be. When this happens, please contact the truss manufacturer to be sure it works. Sliding
a floor truss even a few inches puts more load on the truss you're moving it away from, as shown in the drawing
below.

L/480 live load deflection criteria provides a high degree of
resistance to floor vibration (bounce). The building designer
desiring this benefit may choose to specify an L/480 live load

Typical Bearing / Heel Conditions for
Typical Bearing / Heel Conditions for
Common complaints about noise through ceilings in floor
trusses include walking, moving furniture, and dropping
objects, all of which are considered impact sounds. When
addressing noise in floor systems, the Impact Insulation
Class (IIC) rating is often the most critical value to consider.
In general, IIC values for flooring are similar to their Sound
Transmission Class (STS) values, so satisfying the code
requirement for one will typically work for the other, if not
come close.
A floor/ceiling's ability to limit sound transmission is not highly
dependent on the type of joist or truss to be used, but rather
the types of insulation, sheathing, flooring, and subflooring.
Most basic floor/ceiling construction materials like gypsum
board and hard surface flooring don't provide much IIC value.
The best methods for reducing impact noise, besides substantially increasing the floor systems mass, is to use
specialized acoustic products such as resilient channels and special acoustic underlayment's, as identified in
Figure-1.
Many of these measures are effective at reducing only certain types of noise and work in combination with the
other measures to create a complete soundproofing system. Batt insulation, for example, is effective for
absorbing airborne sounds, but does little or no good against structural/impact noise. While carpeting with a
fairly thick layer of padding beneath it is excellent at reducing impact noise, it is not effective against airborne
noise. For additional information regarding Sound Transmission in Wood Floor and Roof Trusses, refer to
SBCA report:

SRR No. 1601-03
Bracing is extremely IMPORTANT!! Every truss system needs adequate bracing. The purpose of most bracing
is to ensure that the trusses and truss members remain straight and do not bow out of their plane. Inadequate,
improper or incorrectly installed bracing can lead to collapses, failures and serious accidents. An engineered
bracing system will avoid these pitfalls and ensure the structural integrity of the truss system. Trusses need to be
braced during installation, which is called temporary bracing and they need permanent bracing which will remain
installed for the life of the roof system.
Temporary Bracing Guidelines: For metal plate connected wood truss systems, refer to BCSI-B7 for proper
installation bracing guidelines.

locating bearing walls and partitions. Because the System 42 floor truss system can be spaced farther
apart, fewer are needed. Delivered to the job site ready for installation, the lightweight, rigid floor trusses
go up easily and quickly, often without the use of a crane. Wide (3 1/2"), nailable top and bottom chords
speed placement of decking and ceiling material without the need of special fasteners or clips.
Mechanicals are installed quickly through the opening between webs without notching or furring.
Tradesmen are on and off the job faster resulting in earlier completion dates and lower on-site labor costs.
