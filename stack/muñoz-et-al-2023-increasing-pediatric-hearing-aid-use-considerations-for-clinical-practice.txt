Purpose: Hearing aid use can be variable for young children, and inconsistent 
wear time can undermine spoken language development. This study explored 
the effectiveness of hearing aid data logging (DL) awareness and coaching ses-
sions on increasing hours of hearing aid use. We also collected qualitative data 
on challenges participants experienced managing hearing aid use. 
Method: We used a single-subject design that included three conditions, during 
a 6-week period, in the same order for each participant. Condition A was base-
line, Condition B was DL monitoring alone, and Condition C was remote coach-
ing calls plus DL monitoring. 
Results: Hours of hearing aid use increased for each child from baseline to the 
end of the study, ranging from 1.19 to 4.4 hr. Mothers reported that the coach-
ing calls were beneficial and helped them identify and problem-solve issues. 
Conclusions: Parents were able to increase hours of hearing aid use with DL 
awareness and coaching support. Tele-audiology offers an opportunity to pro-
vide parents with more frequent support that can be individualized based on 
their situation, challenges, and family needs. 
Early hearing loss diagnosis makes it possible for 
infants to receive early intervention within the first months 
of life, services critical for supporting child development 
and school readiness (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 
2019). Children who are hard of hearing need to use hear-
ing aids to access speech sounds, and better language out-
comes have been found for young children who use hear-
ing aids 10 or more hours per day (Tomblin et al., 2015). 
Importantly, auditory experience for young children who 
use hearing aids correlates with speech sound produc-
tion and contributes to later literacy success in school 
(Farquharson et al., 2022). Low hours of hearing aid use 
put children at risk for language delay, and hearing aid 
data logging (DL) has revealed a problem with consistent 
hearing aid use for young children (Walker et al., 2013 
[M = 8 hr]; Jones & Launer, 2010 [M = 5 hr]; Muñoz 
et al., 2014 [M = 4 hr]). Caregivers are central to the 
intervention process and need support in learning how to 
effectively manage hearing aids for consistent audibility. 
In a scoping review, Nailand et al. (2022) identified 
16 factors that negatively influenced hearing aid use for 
young children. Importantly, 12 of those factors related to 
the child, parent, and professional were malleable. Studies 
have reported parent challenges for decades, describing anx-
iety related to hearing aid management (Sjoblad et al., 
2001) and handling difficulties associated with hearing aid 
use (Muñoz et al., 2013). Parents have said they want com-
prehensive information, lack confidence, and have feelings 
of uncertainty and frustration related to managing their 
child’s hearing aids (Muñoz et al., 2015). Moreover, parents 
would like the audiologist to check in with them more often 
(Muñoz et al., 2016). Findings from a systematic review 
(Salamatmanesh et al., 2022) recommended DL to monitor 
hearing aid use during the intervention process. Further-
more, authors raised the need for research to determine 
effective clinician counseling and coaching strategies that 
support improvement in parent hearing aid management. 
In another scoping review, Muñoz et al. (2022) 
found four intervention studies aimed at improving hours

of pediatric hearing aid use. Three of the studies provided 
an intervention for parents of young children and had 
mixed success in increasing hours of use. Muñoz et al. 
(2017) provided virtual visits for 6 months for four fami-
lies. Visits included remote DL measurement. For one 
parent, virtual visits were initiated at the time of hearing 
aid fitting, and 10 hr of hearing aid use was achieved and 
maintained. During the study, hours of use increased to 
exceed 10 hr for two families and increased to 8 hr for 
one family. Ambrose et al. (2020) incorporated an educa-
tional program and individualized support within interven-
tion for three parents. Hearing aid use was monitored 
with DL, and hours increased to the goal of 8 hr per day 
for two children and to 3.4 hr for the third child, meeting 
the parent’s goal. Muñoz et al. (2021) conducted a ran-
domized controlled trial with a general sample of parents 
(N = 82) to explore the benefits of a 6-week eHealth hear-
ing aid management program. Significant differences were 
not found for parent-reported hours of hearing aid use 
between groups at 12 weeks (intervention: M = 9.5; con-
trol: M = 8.4); however, parents in the intervention group 
had significantly greater gains for knowledge, confidence, 
and device monitoring. 
It is becoming increasingly common for hearing aids 
to offer mobile apps to provide information such as DL 
and to provide tele-audiology. The Pew Research Center 
(2021) reports that 95%–96% of people aged 18–49 years 
own a smartphone, although for low-income families, 
approximately one quarter report not having a smart-
phone. Some parents may change their behaviors to 
increase hours of use when they receive DL feedback, as 
was found in Muñoz et al. (2014). Until recently, DL 
feedback required a visit to the clinic to obtain the mea-
surement. It is reasonable to consider that frequent access 
to DL on the app may help some parents recognize prob-
lems with consistent use and change their behavior to 
increase hours of use more quickly for their children. Fac-
tors that can be effective in changing parent behavior to 
increase hours of hearing aid use are not clearly under-
stood. To further the discussion in audiology regarding 
parent support 
to 
increase 
hours 
of 
use, 
this 
study 
explored changes in hours of hearing aid use from baseline 
for two conditions: (a) when parents monitored DL daily 
and (b) when parents received coaching to address barriers 
to hearing aid use in addition to DL. 
Method 
We used a single-subject ABC design, where A = 
baseline, B = daily DL feedback, and C = remote coaching 
plus DL monitoring. This design allows demonstration of 
replication across participants when changes are only seen 
after the intervention has been administered, not before 
(Barlow et al., 2009). The study was conducted between 
January 2021 and March 2022. Study procedures were 
approved by the university institutional review board. 
Participants 
Three mothers, recruited from one audiology clinic, 
met the eligibility criteria, consented to participate, and 
completed the study conditions. Eligibility criteria included 
having a child aged birth to 7 years who used their behind-
the-ear hearing aids less than 9 hr per day determined by 
DL, having a smartphone, and being proficient in English 
or Spanish. The children were enrolled in a specialized spo-
ken language–focused early education program for deaf 
and hard of hearing children. All three children received 
audiology services in the onsite pediatric audiology clinic. 
The audiology services did not change; the study activities 
were in addition to the services they received. For the dura-
tion of the study, children used study hearing aids for 
access to DL on the hearing aid app. All three children 
were male, and their hearing loss was identified by 1 month 
of age (see Table 1). The children had been using their 
hearing aids from 9 to 34 months prior to participating in 
this study, and they were home full time with their families 
during participation in the study.

aids (i.e., hearing thresholds, real-ear-to-coupler difference 
[RECD] values) and DL. Study hearing aids were pro-
grammed to match their personal hearing aids using simu-
lated real ear and measured RECDs to match pediatric 
DSL 5.0 targets (see speech intelligibility index values in 
Table 1). One pediatric audiologist, trained in counseling 
and person- and family-centered care, worked with the fami-
lies. During Condition C, the audiologist collaborated with 
the parents to provide support using strategies from motiva-
tional interviewing (Rollnick et al., 2007) for device man-
agement and problem-solving challenges that emerged, such 
as those related to the environment, child state, and parents’ 
emotional state. The target for hours of use was 10 or more; 
daily average was recommended as part of routine services 
families received and discussed during the first study visit. 
Participants completed the study conditions sequentially. 
Condition A 
The audiologist programmed the study hearing aids. 
The app provided parents with access to DL for hours of 
use. The parent came to the clinic and collected the study 
hearing aids and scheduled a Zoom call with the audiolo-
gist for the same day to receive instruction on use of the 
hearing aids. Baseline DL was recorded the first week. 
Prior to the study, DL was variable for Participants 
1 (4.5–8 hr) and 3 (typically 5–6 hr, one time at 9 hr), and 
for Participant 2, DL was consistently low (1–3 hr). There 
was minimal in-person contact because the clinic was fol-
lowing COVID-19 protocols approved by the university 
risk management and safety committee. 
Condition B 
The audiologist met remotely with the parent 1 week 
after they received the hearing aids to provide instruction 
on downloading the app (myPhonak) and accessing DL 
on the app. The study hearing aids were paired to the par-
ent’s phone via Bluetooth. At the time of the study, the 
app was created for adult patients to use, and the pediat-
ric version (myPhonak Junior) had not yet been released. 
In this version of the app, parents were able to track DL 
daily and use Hearing Diary for notes (i.e., child sick, 
child with grandparents for the weekend, etc.), although 
they did not receive any instructions about using the diary 
for the study. Parents were instructed to look at DL after 
they put their child to bed and report the number of hours 
each evening for 2 weeks. DL results were collected and 
stored through REDCap (a secure electronic data man-
agement system). 
Condition C 
The audiologist scheduled weekly video calls, con-
ducted using the Phonak Target programming software 
and the myPhonak app, with the parent on an agreed-
upon day and time for four consecutive weeks. During the 
coaching calls, DL results were obtained from the program-
ming software and were discussed along with barriers/ 
facilitators parents experienced with hearing aid use. The 
audiologist coached the parent in changing and/or main-
taining behaviors that were consistent with achieving rec-
ommended hours of hearing aid use. The audiologist 
guided parents in identifying challenges and potential solu-
tions, using strategies such as asking open-ended questions, 
validating parent emotions, and SMART (specific, measur-
able, achievable, relevant, time-bound) goals to break down 
problem-solving. Parents did not report DL daily; however, 
they continued to have access to DL on the app. 
Analyses 
Consistent with analysis of single-subject designs, 
descriptive statistics were used to report change over time 
within subject, for DL hours of hearing aid, and were 
graphed for each condition. The highest number of hours 
was reported for DL if there was a difference between 
hearing aids. For the coaching phone calls, the audiologist 
documented parent experiences and coaching support in 
REDCap; insights are described for each participant. 
Results 
During Condition B, two parents submitted DL 
hours daily (14/14 [Parents 2 and 3]), and one parent sub-
mitted hours most days (11/14 [Parent 1]). Hours of use 
for Condition C (average for the 4 weeks) increased com-
pared to baseline by 4 hr for two participants (Participants 
1 and 3) and by less than 1 hr (0.49) for Participant 2. See 
Figure 1 for DL results for each child. The four coaching 
calls were on average 13 min in duration (ID1: M = 14, 
SD = 2.35; ID2: M = 13.25, SD = 1.3; ID3: M = 12, 
SD = 4.5). Insights from talking with parents during the 
coaching sessions contributed to understanding issues that 
interfered with hearing aid use. 
Parent 1 
This mother had 9 months of experience with her 
child’s hearing aids at the onset of the study. During the 
first 
coaching 
call, 
the 
audiologist 
learned 
that 
the 
rechargeable hearing aids were on even when the child 
was not using them and they were not in the charger (e.g., 
nap time), inflating DL. The DL hours decreased once 
this was addressed; however, identifying this issue pro-
vided a more accurate understanding of actual hours of 
use. The mother shared that getting DL from the app 
motivated her to “get the number up” and that the daily 
text reminder helped her remember to check DL. She also 
shared strategies she planned to try, such as using toupee

tape to help with hearing aid retention and putting the 
charger in the living room as a visible reminder for her to 
put the hearing aids on her son in the morning. She also 
planned to turn off the hearing aids during breaks to get a 
more accurate number of hours worn. During the final 
call, she reported that her son was sick and this affected 
wear time. She reiterated that being aware of DL with the 
app was helpful, and she planned to work on having her 
child wear his hearing aids throughout the day. 
Figure 1. Data logging collected during the course of the study. Days 1 through 7 are Condition A. Parent 1, Parent 2, and Parent 3 are rep-
resented in purple, red, and green, respectively. 
Parent 2 
This mother had 10 months of experience with her 
child’s hearing aids at the onset of the study. Her son was 
identified with a mild hearing loss early; however, the par-
ents chose not to obtain hearing aids, preferring to wait 
and see if hearing aids would be necessary. During the 
first coaching call, the mother described her biggest con-
cern was losing the hearing aids; she noticed that he ran-
domly takes them out and leaves them around the house. 
She discovered that he thinks it’s fun to look at DL with 
the app, and she began using incentives to motivate her 
son to keep them in. The mother reported that setting an 
alarm was a helpful reminder to put the hearing aids in. 
She shared that she was not consistent in offering him a 
reward for using the hearing aids, and he spent time in 
the splash pad and other water activities that interfered 
with hearing aid use. She felt that summer is a tricky time 
for consistent hearing aid use, but it helped to have it in 
the front of their minds. 
Parent 3 
This mother had 34 months of experience with her 
child’s hearing aids at the onset of the study. During the 
first coaching phone call, the mother indicated that she 
felt the app was helpful because she realized she was over-
estimating how often he wore the hearing aids. She shared 
that her biggest success was putting the hearing aids on 
first thing in the morning and keeping them in all day. 
She indicated her son was more involved with practicing 
insertion and removal, and she noted that giving him 
responsibility helped. During the final call, the mother 
shared that she felt like the remote support was really 
helpful and the app helped her with accountability. 
Discussion 
Parents may need targeted education and support to 
increase the effectiveness of their daily role in supporting 
consistent audibility for their children. We suggest the fol-
lowing considerations when providing pediatric hearing 
aid services for young children:

Teach parents about DL. DL is a tool that can be 
used to support behavior change by providing objective 
information to increase parent awareness. Access to DL 
alone may be sufficient for some parents to modify their 
behaviors and increase hours of use (Muñoz et al., 2014). 
Offer frequent remote check-ins over time following 
the hearing aid fitting. Parents are given much information 
during the hearing aid fitting process, and learning how to 
manage hearing aids for their children can be overwhelm-
ing. Frequent remote check-ins, in addition to typical 
appointments, can help parents gain confidence in this 
new role—from the beginning, rather than waiting for 
problems to become evident and hoping they will resolve 
with time. When parents feel confident, they are more 
likely to navigate challenges effectively. 
Collaborate to provide coordinated support. Working 
together, audiologists, parents, and intervention providers 
can help children have the best audibility possible for a 
trajectory that supports spoken language development. 
The ability to access DL on an app broadens opportuni-
ties for partnering that supports coordinated care and 
effective problem-solving. 
Guide parents in identifying and resolving barriers. 
The aim of supporting parents is to help them develop 
effective routines and confidence in navigating difficult sit-
uations that optimize audibility. Motivational interviewing 
(Rollnick et al., 2007) can help providers guide parents 
with intentional evidence-based counseling techniques that 
support positive change. 
Limitations of our study include the small sample 
size, and other factors, such as participating in the study 
itself, may have contributed to changes in hearing aid use. 
The audiologist had a good rapport with the parents prior 
to participation in the study, and parents were receptive to 
the intervention. At a minimum, the parents perceived 
value in spending time participating in the intervention. 
Because the intervention phase of the study was relatively 
short, four weekly coaching sessions, it may have been 
insufficient to resolve issues impacting wear time, and we 
were not able to determine if the changes in wear time were 
sustained. The audiologist was skilled at guiding parents in 
problem-solving to support their engagement and avoided 
providing parents with a solution. Variations in implemen-
tation of counseling skills and techniques during coaching 
calls could influence effectiveness of parent partnerships. 
Future Directions 
There is a need for additional research to determine 
parent education and support intervention components 
that are effective in increasing hours of hearing aid use 
over time for parents from diverse backgrounds. Given 
the variable outcomes from the intervention studies com-
pleted to date (Muñoz et al., 2022), research to determine 
assessments that provide insights into what information 
and support parents require could help audiologists and 
other intervention providers effectively tailor parent inter-
ventions. Also, future studies that screen for internal bar-
riers 
(thoughts, 
emotions) 
could 
help 
explain 
factors 
influencing wear time and illuminate directions for indi-
vidualized support to overcome barriers. For example, 
parents with high psychological inflexibility had better 
outcomes when they received the remote hearing aid edu-
cation and support intervention than parents in the con-
trol group (San Miguel et al., 2023). 
Conclusions 
Parents of young children who use hearing aids 
received feedback about hearing aid use from DL and 
coaching sessions to address wear time. We found that 
hearing aid use increased, in varying amounts, from the 
intervention. Parents reported receiving benefit from being 
aware of DL from the app and in having accountability 
from the audiologist in the coaching calls.
