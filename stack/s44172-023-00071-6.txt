Biological systems seamlessly combine multiple functions in lightweight and energy-efﬁcient
structures. Such capability in synthetic structures would be desirable in numerous engi-
neering applications such as aerospace, robotics and wearable devices. Here we report an
integrated silicon-based structure conﬁgured to sense, perform different classiﬁcation algo-
rithms, and produce an action signal within the same physical layer. The algorithms are coded
in the mechanical responses of the sensing elements of multiple coupled micro-electro-
mechanical systems (MEMS), simultaneously capturing acceleration measurements to pro-
duce an actuated signal. This all-in-one structure operates with zero circuitry and low power
consumption. As a demonstration, we designed and fabricated a network of three MEMS
neurons to successfully perform both simple signal classiﬁcation and activity recognition
problems (standing and sitting) with only 9.92 × 10−17 kWh and 17.79 × 10−19 kWh energy
consumption per operation, respectively. Our approach will enable emergent technologies,
such as wearable devices, to perform complex computations with power from a single battery
charge.

iological systems such as human skin, eagle wings, or
octopus tentacles inherently integrate sensing, actuation,
and
controls
to
produce
unique
multi-functionality1.
Inspired by these biological systems, there is a growing interest in
developing smart materials (metamaterial) capable of integrating
sensing, actuation, and computation into one structure. The
advancement of these smart materials will impact a large variety
of applications. It may lead to the development of airfoils that
change their aerodynamic proﬁle, robotic skins with a realistic
sense of touch, or even a robotic tentacle that can autonomously
navigate through a patient’s body to perform minimally invasive
surgery1. Mechanical computer is seen as the solution to enable
such advancement2,3. An example is using a micro-electro-
mechanical system (MEMS) for digital computing. Speciﬁcally,
logic gates such as AND, NAND, OR, or XOR have been realized
using a single MEMS device4. However, poor cascading com-
patibility of the MEMS-based logic gates to realize an integrated-
like circuit poses a signiﬁcant challenge5. Inspired by biological
systems, which compute at the sensor level via sensory neurons
and utilize massively parallel, energy-efﬁcient computing in the
brain, this paper demonstrates MEMS neural network hardware
that can perform simultaneous acceleration sensing and a clas-
siﬁcation problem at the same sensor physical layer. This com-
puting architecture eliminates the need for the complex sensors
interface and a digital computing unit to perform similar com-
putations. Thus, it led to hardware that performs machine
learning methods that are no longer shallow and separate
between the sensing and the computing layers.
Results
A MEMS neural network of three neurons is built to perform
simultaneous acceleration sensing and classiﬁcation tasks, as
shown in Fig. 1. Each MEMS neuron consists of one suspended
proof mass supported by meandering tethers. Each mass has
arrays of electrodes extending outwards, forming parallel plate
electrostatic actuators with their adjacent electrodes. Depending
on their purpose, the electrode arrays are referred to as “softening
electrodes” or “coupling electrodes.” The force-displacement
characteristics of the electrode arrays make the movement of
the proof masses highly nonlinear, replicating a neuron’s non-
linear behavior in a typical recurrent neural network (RNN)6. In
this analogy, as shown in Fig. 1b and explained in Supplementary
Notes 1, softening electrodes, which resemble the bias terms in a
typical neural network, induce a negative electrostatic stiffness
which softens the structures. Moreover, coupling electrodes,
which resemble the neural network weights, electrostatically
couple the elements together. The coupling electrodes also pro-

between the proof masses. For example, as shown in the red
arrow in Fig. 1a, the upward movement of mass 3 (M3) reduces
the gap between the interacting electrodes between M2 and M3.
This, in turn, with respect to M2, will produce a high downward
electrostatic force that pushes mass 2 down.

for long hours is linked to musculoskeletal health problems. As a
result, users’ sitting behaviors can be improved by using con-
tinuous stance monitoring. Wearable devices that run sophisti-
cated algorithms on inertial measurements have been proposed in
the literature to provide such monitoring7. However, wearable
devices generally suffer from the tight power budget requirements
to run such techniques continuously in real-life scenarios. Next,
we present the use of the MEMS neural network hardware to
overcome this challenge.
Observing publicly available data8 reveals that the acceleration
proﬁle, along the vertical direction of a sitting activity, resembles
a triangular signal (Fig. 2a) with a positive then a negative (PN)
proﬁle. In contrast, the stand activity starts with an opposite pulse
(i.e., negative then positive (NP) proﬁle pulse). Thus, one way of
performing ARSS is by determining the direction of the
acceleration change; if the acceleration is positive then negative,
the action is sitting. On the other hand, if the acceleration is
negative then positive, the action is standing.
Figure 2b depicts the system at rest with applied bias voltages
and no acceleration. Figure 2c illustrates the operation of the
MEMS neural hardware as an acceleration classiﬁer for ideal
ARSS. In this implementation, M1 should hit its bottom stopper
to indicate an NP signal (Fig. 2c, d), or M3 should hit its upper
stopper to denote a PN signal (Fig. 2e, f). Each action is considered
as a switch closing two different simple circuits representing the
different types of the applied signal. To operate the device for
ARSS, softening electrodes and comb-drive actuators of elements
1 and 3 have the same bias voltage as their respective masses.
Therefore, exerted force from these two components in each
element is equal to zero. Softening electrodes of M2 are biased,
resulting in having the lowest stiffness in the network. Using
this conﬁguration, the classiﬁcation steps for the NP signal are as
follows: (1) as the downward (negative) acceleration part is
applied to the ﬁxed components, the suspended parts of the
structure will move upward due to inertia. M2, with the lowest
stiffness, will dominate the movement and pulls-in toward its
upper stopper. (2) This sudden movement will also decrease the
gap size in interactive electrodes 2-1 and (3) produce a large
electrostatic force pulling M1 down, but not enough to cause it to
pull in (Fig. 2c). (4) Once the positive acceleration starts, M1
moves further down, leading to its pull-in toward its lower stopper
(Fig. 2d). Due to bistability (memory), M2 will not release when
the positive acceleration is applied. Moreover, applying only
positive acceleration alone is insufﬁcient for M1 to pull in. The
sequence of events will be opposite when detecting the PN
acceleration signal performed by M2 and M3 as shown in Fig. 2e,
f. Speciﬁcally, M2 experiences a downward pull-in due to positive
acceleration when a PN signal is applied, reducing the gap in
interacting electrodes 2–3. The following negative acceleration
results in an upward pull-in for M3. Figure 2g displays SEM
images of the device after pull-in, demonstrating that the
electrodes do not make contact due to the presence of stoppers.
We used a simulation model for the MEMS network equations
to validate the network operation as explained in the “Methods”

section. Then, we validate some of these simulations using the
MEMS hardware presented in Fig. 1. Figure 3a shows the model
response where the NP (stand activity) signal is applied. As
expected, the Figure shows when the negative part of the
acceleration signal is applied, all masses, including the middle
mass, green, are moved up. At one point, the middle mass, with
the lowest stiffness, will pull up. This sudden movement will
increase the electrostatic force to move the lower mass (M1 in
blue) down. When the positive part of the input signal
acceleration arrives, the electrostatic and acceleration forces
together cause the M1 to pull down, indicating the detection of
the NP signal. To show the need for consecutive order of negative
and then positive acceleration signals for M1 to pull down, we
show a false signal of applying only a negative acceleration proﬁle
in Fig. 3c. This false signal was selected as it has some
characteristics that may confuse with the signal of interest such
as the decrease and then increase behavior. But it is different as it
does not has the acceleration sign change from negative to
positive as is the case for the truth NP signal. Also, the false signal
was chosen to have a long period to cover almost the full range of
the true NP signal.
Figure 3c shows while at one point after the middle mass is
pulled up; the M1 goes down. However, M1 does not move
enough to produce a pull-down switching. The simulation results
in Fig. 3b show an opposite behavior for the network to cause M1
to pull up when a PN acceleration signal (sitting activity) is
applied. Moreover, Fig. 3d shows that the network, similar to
Fig. 3c, can reject a false-only positive acceleration signal.
Another simulation study we conduct is by varying the input
acceleration amplitude. As an example of this study, Fig. 4 shows
the response of M1 at a peak-to-peak of 5.4 g, 9 g, and 18 g for the
standing acceleration proﬁle case. Those values were selected to
be below, slightly below, and above the signal amplitude in
Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. 6S in Supplementary Notes 2, in all
cases, the middle mass will pull up, as shown in Fig. 3a. The
Figure shows that the 5.4 g peak-to-peak signal will not cause the
pull-in for M1. Thus, besides the input signal shape, its amplitude
is another factor the network can be trained for to perform
classiﬁcation. Adjusting the network sensitivity to the input signal
amplitude can be tuned using the bias voltage electrodes.
The experimental testing of a microfabricated MEMS neural
unit is presented in Fig. 5. A schematic diagram showing the
applied electrical connections is shown in Fig. 5a. Figure 5b shows
the device at rest under an optical microscope. Figure 5c, d show
the ﬁnal response of the system when complete NP and PN
acceleration signals are applied, respectively. As expected, the
Figure shows M2 is pulled upward, and M1 is pulled downward
for the NP signal. In this case, the pull-in of M1 indicates the
detection of an NP signal. When the PN signal is applied, M2 is
pulled downward, and M3 is pulled upward. The pull-in of M3
indicates the detection of a PN signal. To evaluate the ability of
the neural computing unit to reject false signals, similar to the
simulation results in Fig. 3c, d, two acceleration signals were
applied. A positive acceleration signal with a positive slope, then a
negative slope. And a negative acceleration signal with a negative
slope and then a positive slope, as shown in Fig. 5e, f. These
acceleration signals were generated by rotating the device either
90 or −90 degrees from the horizontal position. The right parts of
Fig. 5e, f show that under the applications of those false signals,
while M2 pulled in upward or downward, none of the other

has correctly rejected those signals.
Signal classiﬁcation. The same hardware was conﬁgured dif-
ferently by changing the bias voltages to perform a different
classiﬁcation problem. This conﬁguration distinguishes between
gradually ramping (triangle) and abruptly changing (step/
square) input signals9. Figure 6 illustrates the operation of the
described network as an electrical signal classiﬁer, while Fig. 6a
depicts the device at rest with applied bias voltages. Compared to
the previous acceleration classiﬁcation, the signal to be classiﬁed
is entered as an input voltage to comb-drive actuators of M1 and
M3 and the status of M2 determines the signal class; downward
pull-in of M2 signals the detection of an abrupt signal, and
upward pull-in of M2 signals the detection of a ramp signal. To
achieve such an operation, the computing device is conﬁgured as
follows: (1) Bias voltages applied to all the parallel plate softening
electrodes should be set to bring all three elements close to their
instability (pull-in) point. (2) M3 is biased in such a way that its
potential difference with respect to M2 and, consequently, their
interaction force is stronger compared to that of M1 and M2 (M2

reduces the upper gap between the 2–3 interacting electrodes. Subsequent negative acceleration results in a positive x displacement of device 3 and a
further reduction in the upper gap, causing an upward pull-in for device 3. d Simulating the stand-to-sit activity by gently hitting the device in negative x
direction: initial negative acceleration causes mass 2 to move in the positive x direction with respect to the ﬁxed components and an upward pull-in occurs

negative x-direction movement of device 1, further reduction in the lower gap and a downward pull-in for device 1. Applying only a negative (by rotating the
device 90° from the horizontal position) or only a positive acceleration (by rotating the device −90° from the horizontal position), although causes mass 2
to pull in upward (e) or downward (f) but is not enough to cause pull in for device 1 or 3.

is grounded and Vb3 > Vb1). (3) However, with similar input
applied to the two comb-drive actuators, comb-drive 1 exerts
more force on M1 compared to comb-drive 3 on M3 because of
the lower voltage difference between M3 and comb-drive 3
(Vinput–Vb1 > Vinput–Vb3). Under such conditions, if a large
enough abrupt voltage is applied to the input comb-drives, both
M1 and M3 would pull in almost simultaneously (M1 pulls
downward and M3 pulls upward). In this situation, however, the
stronger coupling (larger interacting force) between M3 and M2
pulls M2 down towards its lower stopper, indicating the detec-
tion of an abrupt increase in the input signal (Fig. 6b). On the
other hand, when a gradually increasing signal is applied to the
two comb-drives, at one-point M1 pulls in ﬁrst since exerted
force from comb-drive 1 is larger and creates greater gradual
displacement compared to comb-drive 3 (Fig. 6c). Downward
pull-in of M1 decreases the gap size in the interacting electrodes
2-1, resulting in a larger attraction force that is enough to push
M2 out of stability and pull it in the upward direction, hitting its
upper stopper. M2 (output neuron) pulling upwards indicates
the detection of a ramp signal. As the input voltage keeps
increasing (Fig. 6d), eventually, M3 pulls in upward. However, its
exerted force on M2 from their interacting electrodes will not be
adequate to pull M2 out of the upward pull-in (the system has
memory). Figure 7 shows the validation of this operation using
the MEMS neural network hardware. Speciﬁcally, a schematic
diagram showing the applied electrical connections is shown in
Fig. 7a. Figure 7b shows the device at rest. Figure 7c shows
the ﬁnal response of the system when an abrupt signal is applied,
and ﬁnally, Fig. 7d, e show the network response to the ramp
signal.
Discussion
This paper presented an integrated sensing and computing
hardware to perform classiﬁcation problems. The presented
MEMS computing hardware can be reconﬁgured to perform
completely different classiﬁcation problems by changing its bias
voltages. The classiﬁcation algorithms are coded in the mechan-
ical responses of the sensing elements of multiple-coupled elec-
trostatic
MEMS
devices
that
simultaneously
capture
the
measurement of interest, such as acceleration. As a result, the
MEMS computing unit, with zero circuitry need, will perform
computing at the sensing physical layer (substrate) and will
require very little energy for only the bias voltages (around
9.92 × 10−17 kWh for the ARSS and 1.779 × 10−19 kWh for the
signal classiﬁcation problem (Supplementary Notes 3) by: (1)
eliminating the need to engage energy-hungry circuitry for con-
ditioning and reading sensor outputs, and (2) due to the capa-
citive
electrostatic
actuation,
the
total
amount
of
energy
consumed in each classiﬁcation cycle by the MEMS network is
very insigniﬁcant. Speciﬁcally, the only energy needed to operate
the described MEMS network is the energy needed to charge the
capacitances associated with the electrostatic actuators. The
energy stored in a charged capacitor is given by Q ¼ 1
2 CV2 .
When the device is settled in a certain state, not undergoing any
change of state, no capacitance charge/discharge occurs. With the
leakage current of the silicon capacitors being practically zero,
there will be zero power consumption (zero static power con-
sumption). In dynamic situations (time history) when the device
is frequently reset and new operations are performed, the energy
required for each measurement is still low and can be calculated
by the capacitor energy storage equation mentioned above, and
the power consumption will be the product of measurement
(operation) frequency and energy per operation.
As discussed in Supplementary Notes 1, the MEMS computing
capabilities resemble the continuous-time recurrent neural net-
works (RNNs). RNNs, in comparison to the typical feedforward
neural networks (FFNNs) have been shown to achieve high
accuracy in classiﬁcation problems that involve time series input
Fig. 6 A schematic for the operation concept of the MEMS network hardware performing signal classiﬁcation. The blue-colored texts indicate the
applied bias voltages. a Schematic of the device along with applied bias voltages. Since Vb3 is larger than Vb1, the interaction force between M2 and M3 is
larger than between M2 and M1. b An abrupt signal is applied to the inputs and M1 and M3 pull-in simultaneously. A larger interactive force causes M2 to
move downward. c A ramp signal is applied, and M1 pull-in ﬁrst as the exerted force from comb-drive 1 is larger. Finally, in panel d, the downward pull-in of
M1 decreases the gap size in the interacting electrodes 2-1. As a result, M2 is pushed out of stability and an upward pull-in occurs.

Fig. 8 A schematic showing the challenge of using a digital computer for wearable device applications to perform classiﬁcation problems. Those
challenges, marked by the red warning signs in the Figure, are the requirements of: (1) the signal conditioning circuit to convert the physical quantities of
acceleration to a voltage signal, (2) converting this signal to a digital signal that is read by a digital computer, and (3) performing the classiﬁcation locally or
transmitting this digitized signal to perform the classiﬁcation at the cloud. Both operations require a signiﬁcant amount of the wearable device’s limited
power.

data. They can process and encode the information contained in
the sequential input data10. One potential application that can
beneﬁt from the presented MEMS computing unit is wearable
wrist devices. Figure 8 shows traditional wearable devices with
highly sensitive and fast-response MEMS motion sensors, such as
accelerometers and gyroscopes, do not have enough processing
power to continuously perform RNN or other kinds of machine
learning locally due to their stringent power requirement and
short battery life11. Moreover, the high energy cost of wirelessly
transmitting data limits the amount of raw sensor data that can
be transmitted to be processed externally12. In both cases, due to
the need to sample the input acceleration signal, problems such as
data delay, loss, or aliasing and lowering the performance of
precision systems might occur. Such limitations reduce the
accuracy of machine learning models13.
On the other hand, the presented integrated sensing and
computing approach eliminates the need for conditioning the
sensor reading and converting it to a digital signal, the power cost
of the digital computer to process the data or transmitting the
data to be processed by outside computer. To put things in
perspective, this cuts most of the power wasted in wearable
devices to perform a classiﬁcation problem, as shown in Fig. 9.
The Figure compares the average power consumed by a wearable
device to read a sensor reading, process it locally or transmit it
outside13 to the power to be consumed of the presented MEMS
network to perform similar functionalities. This low power con-
sumption will enable the presented MEMS hardware to perform
around 0.44 Tera acceleration calciﬁcation using a single charge
of a common wearable battery (with 4.34 × 10−5 kWh capacity).
Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2 show the
estimated energy consumption of the MEMS neural hardware for
both the activity recognition (acceleration classiﬁcation) and the
signal classiﬁcation tasks, respectively.
Methods
Fabrication. SEM view of a fabricated device is shown in Fig. 1c. Elements 1 and 3
are equipped with comb-drive actuators, which, if desired, can exert displacement-
independent forces on the vertically moving proof masses. The two elements have
identical components. However, they pull-in in the opposite direction if they reach
the instability or pull-in point. Depending on the application and implementation,
the forces acting on the proof masses can be due to the softening electrodes,
interacting electrodes, comb-drive actuators, or acceleration. Therefore, this
building block could be utilized as either a signal classiﬁer or an acceleration
pattern classiﬁer using only micro-mechanical elements. Elements 1 and 3 are
electrostatically coupled to the 2nd element in the middle via two interactive
electrodes. Softening electrodes of element 2 have identical gap sizes on each side.
All elements have their stoppers to limit the movement of the moving elements and
prevent any contact between the electrodes.
A basic single-mask micromachining process was used to fabricate the devices
on a highly doped p-type Silicon On Insulator (SOI) substrate with a 50μm thick
silicon device layer and 3μm thick buffer oxide layer (BOX). The device layer was
ﬁrst patterned via an optical lithography step, and the structures were carved out of
the SOI device layer via deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) to the BOX. The BOX
layer was then removed underneath narrower features by a timed hydroﬂuoric acid
etch to suspend the structures. The devices were subsequently immersed in a
solution of naphthalene and isopropyl alcohol to mitigate the risk of stiction to the
handle layer or between components, utilizing the release technique outlined by
Nikfarjam et al.14.
Mathematical modeling and simulation. A mathematical model was built to
simulate the described system. The simulation results conﬁrmed the observed
Fig. 9 Power consumption comparison for sensor measurement between
a traditional wearable device and our MEMS computing hardware. The
plot shows the signiﬁcant amount of power being cut by the MEMS
computing network.

where, as described in Fig. 10, NCDi is the number of comb-drive ﬁngers coupled
with mass i. VCDi is the voltage applied between mass i and the associated comb-
drive. gi is the lateral gap between the coupled ﬁngers, di is the vertical gap between
them, and Di is the vertical gap between the comb drive itself and mass i. Wi is the
width of the comb drive while wi is the ﬁnger’s width. NPPij is the number of
coupling parallel-plate electrodes between masses i and j. And VPPij is the voltage
applied between them. Lij is the overlapping length of the electrodes. dUij and dLij
are the upper and lower gaps between the sandwiched parallel-plates electrodes,
respectively. t is the silicon structure’s thickness and ε is the absolute permittivity of
air. €y is the acceleration input to the MEMS network. As the MEMS proof mass will
move when the acceleration signal is applied, the network will directly respond to
acceleration without the need for a signal conditioning circuit as is the case for
typical neural networks implanted in digital computers. Finally, the output of this
MEMS network is the switching status between mass 3 and its stopper and mass 1
with its stopper.
Experiment procedure. The fabricated device was mounted on a PCB and wire-
bonded. The applied biases for the acceleration classiﬁcation can be seen in
Fig. 5a. All masses are electrically connected through their conductive sup-
porting springs, and the softening electrodes of element 3 are grounded. As
previously stated, for this particular application, the softening electrodes and
comb-drive actuators do not exert any force on M1 and M3. M1, M3, their
softening electrodes, and comb-drive actuators were biased with 8.5 V (Vb1 =
Vb2 = 8.5 V). The pull-in voltage of M2, using the parallel plate softening
electrodes, was measured to be 27.6 volts. To generate negative electrical stiffness
and increase M2’s sensitivity to lower accelerations, Vb2 was set to 27.5 V, which
is slightly lower than the pull-in voltage of that element. Additionally, an
accelerometer was attached to the PCB to measure the real-time acceleration
applied to the device.
In order to achieve the desired signal classiﬁcation, the device requires a
speciﬁc application of biases, as depicted in Fig. 7a. Speciﬁcally, Vb1 has been
set to 26 V, while Vsoft-1 is set to 9 V. Additionally, M2 is connected to the
ground, and 28 V is applied to its softening electrodes (Vsoft-2). Vb3 and
Vsoft-3 have been set to 36 V and 12 V, respectively. The input voltage
controlling the comb-drive actuators was abruptly increased from 0 to 70 volts
(step signal) to test the device’s ability to detect abruptly increasing signals. For
the ramping experiment, the input signal was gradually increased from 24 V to
70 volts.
