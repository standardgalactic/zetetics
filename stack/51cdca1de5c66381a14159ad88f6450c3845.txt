In

The

in

In

in
whic
h
it
is
stored,
and
s/he
pa
ys
this
serv
er
for
the
retriev
ed
information.
Therefore,
in
our
en
vironmen
t,
a
serv
er
is
concerned
only
with
the
datasets
stored
in
its
lo
cal
databases,
and
is
indieren
t
to
the
exact
lo
cation
of
datasets
not
stored

.

The

determine
the

h
new
dataset
will
b
e
stored
and
they
are
also
able
to
c
hange
the
lo
cation
of
old
datasets.
Since
the
datasets
considered
are
v
ery
large,
eac
h
dataset
can
b
e
stored
only
in
one
serv
er,
and
it
is
forbidden
for
a
serv
er
to
store
a
dataset
unless
it
has
b
ecome
its
legal
\o
wner."
Conicts
among
the
serv
ers
ma
y
arise
when
t
w
o
or
more
serv
ers
w
ould
lik
e
to
store
the
same
dataset
lo
cally
.
In
a
cen
tralized
system,
a
solution
for
suc
h
a
problem
is
simple:
the
lo
cation
of
eac
h
dataset
will
b
e
determined
so
as
to
maximi
ze
the
prots
of
the
en
tire
system.
But
a
dataset
allo
cation
whic
h
is
b
enecial
for
the
en
tire
system
ma
y
b
e
non-b
enecial
for
some
of
the
serv
ers.
In
our
case,
where
eac
h
serv
er
has
its
o
wn
in
terests,
the
serv
ers
will
follo
w
the
cen
tralized
solution
only
if
it
is
b
enecial
to
them.
Th
us,
an
y
prop
osed

e
fair
and
consider
the
preferences
of
all
the
serv
ers
in
order
to
b
e
accepted
b
y
the
designers
of
the
serv
ers.
Moreo
v
er,
if
there
is
incomplete
information
ab
out
the
usage
of
datasets,
then
the
cen
tralized
solution
is
not
applicable,
since
nob
o
dy
has
enough
information
in
order
to
compute
this
solution.
In
all
the
situations
whic
h
w
e
considered,
the
serv
ers
are
uncertain
ab
out
the
future
usage
of
the
datasets.
First,
w
e
ha
v
e
considered
a

where

That

for

the

If

the

deriv

from

the

if
there

since
all

then
the

The

eac

Th
us,
the

do
not

In

there
is
no
need
to
sync
hronize

Sim
ultaneous
announcemen

not

the

indep

of
the

The
sim
ultaneous

is

unnecessary
,
since

the
dominan

to

If

Relo

But,
allo
cating
a
dataset
in
its

causes
costs
only
to
the

since
it
receiv

the

In

can
b
e
implemen

in
a

system
in
whic
h
no

tral

its
implemen

is

will
ensure
satisfactory
results.
Ho
w
ev
er,
ev
en
though
bidding
the
true
utilit

of
obtaining
the

is
a
dominan

strategy
,
it
ma
y
b
e
b

to
co

based
on
an
agreemen

negotiated
b
et
w
een
them
prior

so
that
the

a

and
the

-
the
winner
-
will
pa
y
a
reduced

That
is,
bidding
the
true
utilit

is
not
in
a
strong
Nash
equilibrium
[
],
since
there
ma
y
b
e
a
subgroup
of
agen

whic
h
can
gain
when
they
deviate
together
from
the
suggested
strategies.
If
comm
unicatio
n
during
the
bidding
pro
cess
is
forbidden,
then
the
serv

will
not
b
e
able
to

In
situations
where
co

y

if
there
is
complete

then
should
the

the

in
the
case
of

so
that
the

in

allo

but
the
gains
will
b

distributed
dieren

In
situations
of

and
in

Estimating
Usage
In
real-w
orld

the

ma
y
ha
v
e
incomplete
information
ab
out
the
w
orld.
Th
us,
ev
aluating
their
exp
ected
prots
is
problematic.
In
our
en
viron-

w
e
assume
that
all

e
common
kno
wledge
ab
out
storage
cost
and
answ
er
cost,
but
ma
y
ha
v
e
asymmetric
information
ab
out
the
usage
of
old
datasets
and
usage
of
k
eyw
ords
in
the
past
queries,
and
th
us
the
agen
ts
will
ha
v
e
an
asymmetric
and
uncertain
information
ab
out
the
future
usage
of
datasets.
Eac
h
agen
t
kno
ws
only
the
past
usage
of
its

cal

so
it
will
estimate
the
future
usage
of
these
datasets
for
eac
h
geographical
area,
using
its
kno
wledge
of
the
past
usage.
Estimating
the
future
usage
of
new
datasets
and
datasets
lo
cated
in
remote
serv
ers
is
more
dicult,
since
the
agen
t
has
no
kno
wledge
regarding
their
past
usage.
In
order
to
accomplish
this,
the
agen
t
will
use
information
ab
out
the
datasets'
con
ten
ts.
Eac
h
dataset
is
c
haracterized
b
y
sev
eral
k
eyw
ords,
and
eac
h
query
consists
of
k
eyw
ords.
When
a
query
is
handled,
the
serv
er
sa
v
es
the
information
ab
out
the
query
,
including
the
k
eyw
ords
whic
h
the
query
con
tains,
i.e.,
the
agen
t
sa
v
es
the
past
usage
of
eac
h
area
for
eac
h
k
eyw
ord
and
eac
h
lo
cal
dataset.
When
an
estimation
ab
out
a
new
or
remote
dataset
is
required,
the
agen
t
uses
the
information
it
has
ab
out
the
k
eyw
ords'
past
usage
and
computes
the
exp
ected
usage
of
the
dataset
according
to
the
k
eyw
ords
it
is
familiar
with.
The
future
usage
of
a
new
dataset
b
y
eac
h
geographical
area
can
also
b
e
estimated
according
to
the
past
usage
of
similar
datasets,
when
their
similarit
y
is
measured
according
to
the
k

that

If

Ho

ev

the

In

the

According

the

v
ariable

of
a

there
is
a
gap
b
et
w
een
its
p

and
the
p

of
the
cen
tralized
allo

This
gap
w
as
caused
since
eac
h
serv
er
had
only
partial
information
ab
out
the
future
usage
of
datasets.
Ho
w
ev
er,
the

mec

obtained
a
m

lo
w
er
standard
deviation
than
the
cen
tralized
alternativ
es.
W
e
also
carried
out
a
set
of
sim

to
test
the
eect
of
the

As

w

found
that

decreases
(i.e.,
the

the
static

increases)

there

In

cares
ab
out
the

cation
of

ev
en
when
suc
h
a

a

proto
col
is
not
b
enecial,
since
the

agen
t
cannot
inuence
the
lo
cation
of

F
or
suc
h

ts,
w
e
suggest
elsewhere
[0

using
the
strategic
mo
del
of
alternating

as
a

metho
d,
enabling
eac

inuence
the

of
the

of

ev
en
without

W
e
sho
w
ed,
ho
w
ev
er,
that

is

etter
than
strategic
