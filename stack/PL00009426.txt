Abstract.
The atomic structures of quasicrystalline materials exhibit long range order
under translations. It is believed that such materials have atomic structures which approx-
imately obey local rules restricting the location of nearby atoms. These local constraints
are typically invariant under rotations, and it is of interest to establish conditions under
which such local rules can nevertheless enforce order under translations in any structure
that satisﬁes them.
A set of local rules L in Rn is a ﬁnite collection of discrete sets {Yi} containing 0, each
of which is contained in the ball of radius ρ around 0 in Rn. A set X satisﬁes the local rules
L under isometries if the ρ-neighborhood of each x ∈X is isometric to an element of L.
This paper gives sufﬁcient conditions on a set of local rules L such that if X satisﬁes L
under isometries, then X has a weak long-range order under translations, in the sense that
X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type. A set X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type if it is a Delone set
whose interpoint distance set X −X is a discrete closed set. We show for each minimal
Delone set of ﬁnite type X that there exists a set of local rules L such that X satisﬁes L
under isometries and all other Y that satisfy L under isometries are Delone sets of ﬁnite
type.
A set of perfect local rules (under isometries or under translations, respectively) is a set
of local rules L such that all structures X that satisfy L are in the same local isomorphism
class (under isometries or under translations, respectively). If a Delone set of ﬁnite type has
a set of perfect local rules under translations, then it has a set of perfect local rules under
isometries, and conversely.

Introduction

crystalline materials exhibit strong long-range order under translations, in the sense of

having X-ray diffraction patterns containing sharp spots (“Bragg peaks”). The physical
mechanisms leading to the formation and stability of such materials are apparantly well
described by Gibbs-type statistical mechanics models. These models describe equilib-
rium structures as arising in a competition between minimum energy and maximum
entropy. However, no mathematical derivation determining the possible structures that
may occur has been given.1 It is empirically observed that the arrangements of atoms in
many materials appear to favor special local conﬁgurations, which can be called “clus-
ters.” This motivates the purely geometric problem of studying those discrete sets X
such that the ρ-neighborhood of each x ∈X is isometric to one of a ﬁnite list L of
ρ-neighborhoods of 0. We call a set L used this way a set of local rules under isometries.
The object of this paper is to show that a wide variety of structures that possess a weak
form of long-range order under translations can arise as a forced consequence of “local
rules” which themselves are invariant under the larger group of isometries.
There are many special structures for which such “local rules” have previously been
obtained. A set X in Rn is an ideal crystal if it consists of a ﬁnite number of translates
of a full rank lattice, see [56]. In 1976 Delone et al. [14] showed that local rules under
isometries existed for all ideal crystalline structures whose symmetry group is transitive
on the set of all points (“regular point system”). A similar result was established for all
ideal crystals in Dolbilin et al. [15]. There are now many results giving local rules under
isometries characterizing various special classes of aperiodic structures with crystallo-
graphically forbidden symmetries, e.g., tilings with 5-, 8-, 10-, and 12-fold rotational
symmetries in their diffraction spectrum. These structures typically have perfect local
rules, in the sense that all structures that satisfy the local rules are locally isomorphic
under translations. They also have strong long-range order under translations which is
manifested as a well-deﬁned diffraction pattern, which usually includes some discrete
spectrum. For such results, see the survey of Ingersent [29].
The results obtained in this paper apply to a general class of structures X which
possess a weak long-range translational order without necessarily having a well-deﬁned
diffraction measure. This weak long-range translational order is that the additive group
[X] generated by the elements of X is ﬁnitely generated, i.e., [X] is a quasilattice in
the terminology of Le et al. [39] and Mermin [44]. In the cases where our results apply,
the local rules obtained enforce weak long-range translational order on all structures
that satisfy them, but these local rules may be imperfect in the sense that the structures
satisfying them may not all be locally isomorphic.
We formulate basic deﬁnitions. Delone sets are a mathematical idealization of a
“solid-state” structure.
Deﬁnition 1.1.
A Delone set or (r, R)-set is any set in Rn having the following two
properties:
(i) Uniformly Discrete. There is anr > 0 such that each open ball of radiusr contains
at most one element of X.
1 It is still an open problem to prove rigorously that a crystalline structure can arise as a minimal energy
arrangement of atoms under electromagnetic forces. See [49], [50], and Problem 11 of [58].

347
(ii) Relatively Dense. There is an R > 0 such that each closed ball of radius R
contains at least one point of X.
In part I we introduced a large class of discrete sets in Rn possessing a weak long-range
translational order which we called Delone sets of ﬁnite type. This class of sets apparently
includes nearly all proposed models for the atomic arrangements of quasicrystalline
materials, as well as other sets, see [33], [34], [35], [40], [41], [45], and [46].
Deﬁnition 1.2.
A Delone set of ﬁnite type is any Delone set X such that X −X is a
discrete closed set, i.e., the intersection of X −X with any closed ball is a ﬁnite set.
In part I we showed that a set X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type if and only if, for each
T > 0, it has only ﬁnitely many different T -neighborhoods of a point under translations.
Here the T-neighborhood of a point x ∈X is
PX(x; T ) := X ∩B(x; T ),
where B(x; T ) is the closed ball of radius T centered at x. A centered T -patch P =
PX(x; T ) −x is any translate of a T -neighborhood to the origin. Part I showed that
Delone sets of ﬁnite type are characterized by local rules under translations, i.e., a set
X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type if and only if the set L of centered 2R-patches of X
is ﬁnite; any set Y that satisﬁes L under translations is a Delone set of ﬁnite type. An
important property of Delone sets of ﬁnite type X is that they are ﬁnitely generated, i.e.,
the group of translations [X] spanned by the vectors in X is ﬁnitely generated. Thus [X]
is a quasilattice; that is, a ﬁnitely generated group of translations in Rn that spans Rn
as an R-vector space, see [39]. By picking a basis [v1, . . . , vs] of this Z-module [X] we
can describe elements of X using s integer coordinates, and we may regard X as a linear
projection of a subset ˜X of the lattice Zs in Rs. In particular, such sets X can always be
described using a ﬁnite number of “internal dimensions.”
The basic question that this paper addresses is: For which Delone sets of ﬁnite type
X do there exist local rules L under isometries such that X satisﬁes L and any set Y
that satisﬁes L is also a Delone set of ﬁnite type? Our main result is that the class of
sets X for which such local rules under isometries exist includes all Delone sets of
ﬁnite type that are minimal. A Delone set of ﬁnite type X is minimal if it is repetitive
(under translations), i.e., there is a function MX(T ) such that, for each positive T , the
intersection of X with any ball of radius MX(T ) centered at a point of X contains a
translate of every T -patch of X. Minimal sets are an important class because they can
be viewed as a mathematical analogue of a “ground state” of a physical system. This
notion of minimality coincides with minimality of an associated dynamical system with
an Rn-action, see Section 4. Radin [48]–[50], [53] deﬁnes a “ground state” for analogous
models in statistical mechanics to be a set of conﬁgurations that is minimal and uniquely
ergodic, i.e., strictly ergodic,2 under an Rn-action for tiling systems or under a Zn-action
2 For a Delone set X of ﬁnite type, strict ergodicity implies that any T -patch occurs in X with a positive
limiting asymptotic density, so that X has a well-deﬁned diffraction measure (Fourier transform of autocorre-
lation measure), see [28]. Thus it has long-range order in the sense of part I. This diffraction measure need not
have strong long-range order in the sense of having “Bragg peaks” (delta functions).

for lattice systems. Our notion of what constitutes a “ground state” is thus slightly more
inclusive than Radin’s.
In Section 3 we give sufﬁcient conditions for a set of local rules L under isometries
to enforce structures which are Delone sets of ﬁnite type (Theorem 3.1). In Section 4 we
show that these sufﬁcient conditions can always be satisﬁed for minimal Delone sets of
ﬁnite type, and so obtain:
Theorem 1.1.
Let X be a Delone set of ﬁnite type X in Rn which is minimal. Then
there exists a set of local rules L under isometries such that X satisﬁes L and any other
set Y that satisﬁes L is a Delone set of ﬁnite type.
This result applies to a large variety of structures, because minimal sets are ubiquitous.
Given any Delone set of ﬁnite type X there always exists a minimal set X′ which is a limit
of larger and larger patches of X. That is, there is a sequence of translations {xk : k ≥1}
such that, for each T > 0,
X′ ∩B(0; T ) = lim
k→∞(X −xk) ∩B(0; T ),
(1.1)
where the limit is taken pointwise. (This fact follows by a standard argument in topo-
logical dynamics, using Zorn’s lemma, see p. 29 of [18].)
The conﬁgurational entropy of a Delone set of ﬁnite type X in Rn is given by
Hc(X) := lim sup
T →∞
1
T n log(N ∗
X(T )),
(1.2)
where N ∗
X(T ) counts the number of translation-inequivalent T -patches of X, see part
I. The known constructions of Delone sets of ﬁnite type having perfect local rules ap-
parently all have zero conﬁgurational entropy. This has been proved in special cases,3
notably for Penrose tilings, which contain at most O(T 2) different T -patches, because
all T -patches appear at least once inside any patch of radius cT , for c = 11.09, see
p. 563 of [25]. It is known that there exist Delone sets of ﬁnite type that are minimal
but have positive conﬁgurational entropy, as follows in the one-dimensional case from a
result of Furstenberg [17, Theorem III.2]. Such sets are covered by Theorem 1.1.
The “local rules” whose existence is shown by Theorem 1.1 do not necessarily iden-
tify a single local isomorphism class of structures. Let LT (X) denote the set of all T -
patches of X. It seems possible that the conﬁgurational entropy of the class of structures
6(LT (X)) produced by the local rules of radius T can be larger than the conﬁgurational
entropy Hc(X) of the initial structure X. We conjecture that as the radius T increases,
the conﬁgurational entropy Hc(6(LT (X))) decreases to Hc(X) as T →∞.
Theorem 1.1 shows that local rules under isometries can specify a wide variety of
structures describable using a ﬁnite number s of “internal dimensions,” where s is gener-
ally larger than the dimensionality n of the space Rn. It remains an open question whether
every Delone set of ﬁnite type X satisﬁes a set of local rules L which themselves can be
satisﬁed only by Delone sets of ﬁnite type.
3 See [16] and [19]. Related entropy zero results for lattice gas models appear in [49] and [51].

349
In Section 4 we give several characterizations of minimal Delone sets. We deﬁne
a concept of minimality of a Delone set X under isometries, which we call isometry-
minimal, and show that it corresponds to minimality for a topological dynamical system
with an En-action, where En denotes the Euclidean group of isometries of Rn. We prove
that for Delone sets of ﬁnite type the properties of minimality and isometry-minimality
coincide (Theorem 4.3). In the remainder of Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.1.
In Section 5 we study perfect local rules. A set X has perfect local rules L under
translations if all sets Y that satisfy L under translations are locally isomorphic to X
under translations. Any set X having perfect local rules is necessarily a Delone set of
ﬁnite type that is minimal. We deﬁne perfect local rules L under isometries analogously:
any two sets X that satisfy L under isometries are locally isomorphic under isometries,
i.e., they have the same set of T -neighborhoods under isometries, for each positive T . It
is generally easier to verify the existence of perfect local rules under translations than to
verify it for isometries. In Section 5 we prove:
Theorem 1.2.
Let X be a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn. Then X has perfect local rules
under translations if and only if X has perfect local rules under isometries.
Structures having perfect local rules under translations or under isometries seem
to be extremely special. The known examples of sets having perfect local rules under
translations make use of a self-similarity property, as described by G¨ahler [20]. Ideal
crystals are included under such constructions, using a similarity factor which is an
integer m ≥2. There may well exist examples of structures having perfect local rules
under translations that are based on self-afﬁne constructions rather than self-similar
constructions. The most general result on sets having perfect local rules under isometries
is that of Goodman-Strauss [24], which proves that perfect local rules under isometries
exist for nearly all substitution tilings.
There do exist Delone sets which have perfect local rules under isometries, but do not
have perfect local rules under translations. One such example comes from the pinwheel
tilings of Radin [52]. Another example comes from the vertices of the SCD-tiles in [12],
for SCD(m/n, s, h) with n odd, using fact (13) in [12]. The quaquaversal tilings of
Conway and Radin [9] can be suitably decorated to yield a Delone set with perfect local
rules under isometries, using the result of Goodman-Strauss [24]. Theorem 1.2 implies
that these structures are not4 Delone sets of ﬁnite type.
There have been many previous studies of “local rules” for quasicrystals. Much of
this work has been based on tiling models for quasicrystals. In the Appendix we relate
various notions of “local rules” and “matching rules” for tiling models to the concepts
deﬁned here for Delone set models. We include a formal deﬁnition of “perfect matching
rules,” which is a more general concept than “perfect local rules.” The concept of “perfect
matching rules” involves the notion of one tiling being locally derivable from another,
which was introduced by Baake et al. [4]. Most previous work on tilings allows prototiles
to be moved only by translations; in that case decorations of these tilings yield Delone
sets of ﬁnite type. Several authors have developed “local rules” (under translations)
4 This fact can be proved directly for these structures, without recourse to Theorem 1.2.

for tilings which enforce stronger properties, for example, “quasiperiodicity,” see, for
example, [22], [29], and [36]–[38]. The use of Delone set models for certain quasicrystals
and interconversions between Delone sets and tilings, particularly with “perfect matching
rules,” is discussed in [32].
Concerning physical quasicrystals it is now known that there are some materials (for
example, Al Pd Mn) that exhibit a quasicrystalline phase that is thermodynamically sta-
ble, i.e., which at some temperatures and pressures is the structure that minimizes the
free energy, see p. 236 of [23]. Recent proposals of Steinhardt and Jeong [60] present
mechanisms to explain how Penrose tilings can arise as “energy-minimizing” arrange-
ments of overlapping local conﬁgurations, and Burkov [7], [8] supplied similar results
for tilings related to the Tubingen triangle tilings. These conﬁgurations are speciﬁed by a
kind of “local rules under translations.” The interpretation of “local rules” as representing
energy-minimizing interactions at low temperature has been repeatedly proposed, see
[42], Section 6 of [29], and [22].
A wide variety of other quasicrystalline materials are not known to be thermody-
namically stable but instead are currently believed to be entropically stabilized. For
entropically stabilized materials the possible conﬁguations consist of a large number
of nearly equal energy conﬁgurations which are interchangeable among themselves.
These conﬁgurations minimize the free energy at the given temperature and pressure,
in a competition between minimum energy and maximum entropy. We view these sets
of conﬁgurations as being analogous to minimal sets [[X]]E in Section 4 with positive
conﬁgurational entropy. Sets of positive conﬁgurational entropy given by local rules may
arise in “random tiling” models for quasicrystals, see [26] and [27].
The results of this paper demonstrate the existence of local rules under isometries
that enforce weak long-range translational order. Our purpose here is only to show that
such local rules exist, without giving reasonable bounds on the distances over which
these local rules act. We were therefore able to make the simplifying assumption that
all local rules consist of spherical neighborhoods. More ﬂexible “local rules” that use
nonspherical neighborhoods appear in the concept of a “Delone graph” introduced in
[13], and in the “local rules” considered in [60].
Finally we observe that the results of this paper apply to more general solid state
structures than those which have strong long-range order given by an X-ray diffraction
pattern consisting entirely of delta functions (“Bragg peaks”). There are minimal Delone
sets of ﬁnite type which do not have long-range order in this sense. It is therefore at
least conceivable that there exist thermodynamically stable materials which have atomic
positions described by a Delone set of ﬁnite type, which are not quasicrystalline in this
sense. Such structures would not necessarily have X-ray diffraction patterns with any
“Bragg peaks” from which the translational ordering can be inferred. Possibilities of this
sort have been advocated by Danzer [11], see also Berend and Radin [5].

When Y is a ﬁnite set, |Y| denotes the number of elements of Y. If Y is in
Rn, then [Y] denotes the additive subgroup of Rn generated by the elements of Y; we
regard [Y] as a Z-module.

where O(n, R) is the orthogonal group, i.e., O(n, R) = {M : M Mt = I}. The transla-
tion group T n is the subgroup of En where Q is the identity; we sometimes identify it
with Rn.
For an arbitrary set Y in Rn we deﬁne its point symmetry group (at x = 0) by
Psym(Y) := {Q ∈O(n, R) : QY = Y}.
For a collection of sets X we analogously deﬁne Psym(X)={Q ∈O(n, R): QX =X}.
The notations [[X]]E and [[X]]T denote the local isomorphism classes of X un-
der isometries and translations, respectively. For a collection of local rules L, the sets
6E(L) and 6T (L) consist of all sets Y that satisfy the local rules under isometries and
translations, respectively. For a Delone set X, the sets 6E(X) and 6T (X) consist of all
structures Y, each of whose T -neighborhoods is isometric (resp. translation-equivalent)
to a T -neighborhood of X, for all T > 0.

Preliminary Results
In this section we prove basic properties of Delone sets of ﬁnite type under translations
andunderisometries.Wealsorelatethelocalisomorphismclassesof X undertranslations
and isometries.
The concept of an enclosed point, which was introduced in [15], plays an important
role in many proofs in this paper.
Deﬁnition 2.1.
(i) A point y ∈Y is called an enclosed point of Y if it is in the interior
of the convex hull of Y.
(ii) A set Y is called an enclosing set if it contains an enclosed point.
For an enclosed point the vectors {y′ −y : y′ ∈Y} span Rn. It follows that if Y is an
enclosing set, then an isometry ϕ of Rn is uniquely determined by the data y →ϕ(y)
for y ∈Y.
Deﬁnition 2.2.
(i) A point x ∈X is R-enclosed if it is an enclosed point of the set
X ∩B(x; R).
(ii) A point x in a set X is an R-point or is strongly R-enclosed if each closed ball of
radius R that contains x on its boundary also contains another point of X.
Lemma 2.1.
(i) Any strongly R-enclosed point x ∈X is R-enclosed.
(ii) If every point x ∈X is strongly R-enclosed, then X is relatively dense with
constant R, and conversely.
Proof.
See Lemma 3.2 of [15].
We deﬁne “local” properties of sets X under isometries and under translations. We
ﬁrst consider isometries.

352
J. C. Lagarias
Deﬁnition 2.3.
(i) A T-star is any T -neighborhood PX(x; T ) of some x ∈X, viewed
as being movable by isometries. We call x the center of the T -star. A centered T-star P
is obtained by translating it to the origin, i.e.,
P := X ∩B(x; T ) −x.
(2.1)
(ii) The T-atlas of X under isometries, denoted AE
X(T ), is the set of all isometry
equivalence classes of T -stars of X.
Deﬁnition 2.4.
Twosets X and X′ arelocallyisomorphicunderisometriesif X contains
an isometric copy of each T -star of X′ and vice-versa, i.e., if
AE
X(T ) = AE
X′(T ),
for each
T > 0.
(2.2)
We let [[X]]E denote the collection of all sets X′ locally isomorphic to X under
isometries. There is a partial order ≤E on such local isomorphism classes, in which
[[X]]E ≤E [[X′]]E
(2.3)
provided that, for each T > 0, X′ contains an isometric copy of every T -star of X.
Deﬁnition 2.5.
A local isomorphism class [[X]]E is isometry-minimal if it is minimal
in the partial order ≤E. We also say that a set X is isometry-minimal if [[X]]E is isometry-
minimal.
Deﬁnition 2.6.
A Delone set X is of isometry-ﬁnite type or is of ﬁnite type under
isometries if |AE
X(T )| is ﬁnite for all T > 0.
These sets are characterized by the following ﬁniteness condition.
Theorem 2.1.
Let X be a Delone set in Rn with relative denseness constant R. Then X
is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type if and only if it has ﬁnitely many isometry classes
of 3R-neighborhoods, i.e., if and only if |AE
X(3R)| is ﬁnite.
Proof.
One direction is clear. For the other direction, suppose that |AE
X(3R)| is ﬁnite,
and we must show for each T > 0 that X has only ﬁnitely many T -neighborhoods up to
isometries. We may suppose 0 ∈X by translating X if necessary. By hypothesis there
are a ﬁnite number of choices for the 3R-neighborhood PX(0; 3R), up to isometry. Let
this neighborhood be chosen. We show there are only ﬁnitely many possible ways to
extend it to a neighborhood PX(0; T ). For each point x ∈PX(0; 3R) with ||x|| < 2R,
its R-neighborhood
Y := X ∩B(x; R) ⊆PX(0; 3R)
is completely determined by PX(0; 3R). By Lemma 2.2 Y is an enclosing set of x, so
{x′ −x : x′ ∈Y} spans Rn. For a given Q ∈O(n, R), the images {Qx′ : x′ ∈Y}
determine Q uniquely, hence it follows that there are only ﬁnitely many ways to extend

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
353
Y to a 3R-neighborhood of x using a set isometric to one of the sets in AE
X(3R). By
the Delone property the resulting 3R-neighborhoods for all such x cover a larger region
which includes B(0; 4R). We now proceed by induction on k, for k ≥4, to extend to
X ∩B(0; (k +1)R) given X ∩B(0; kR), making a ﬁnite number of choices of cardinality
bounded in terms of n, r, R, and k, using the Delone property of X. Continuing in this
way we eventually determine PX(0; T ), while making ﬁnitely many choices in all, so
|AE
X(T )| is ﬁnite. Thus X is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type.
We now deﬁne analogous concepts for equivalence under translations.
Deﬁnition 2.7.
(i) A T-patch P is any T -neighborhood of x ∈X, regarded as movable
by translations. A centered T-patch is a T -patch translated to the origin, again given by
(2.1).
(ii) The T-atlas of X (under translations), denoted AX(T ), is the set of translation
equivalence classes of T -patches of X.
Deﬁnition 2.8.
Two sets X and X′ are locally isomorphic (under translations) if X
contains a translate of each T -neighborhood of X′ and vice-versa, i.e., if
AX(T ) = AX′(T ),
for each
T > 0.
(2.4)
We let [[X]]T denote the collection of all sets X′ locally isomorphic to X under
translations. We have a partial order ≤T on such sets, where
[[X]]T ≤T [[X′]]T
(2.5)
means that the set X′ contains a translate of every T -patch of X, for each T > 0.
Deﬁnition 2.9.
A local isomorphism class [[X]]T is minimal (under translations) if it
is minimal in the partial order ≤T . We also say that X is minimal (under translations) if
[[X]]T is minimal.
In part I it was shown that a set X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type if and only if |AX(T )|
is ﬁnite for all T > 0.
Theorem 2.2.
Let X be a Delone set in Rn with relative denseness constant R. Then
X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type (under translations) if and only if it has ﬁnitely many
translation-equivalence classes of 2R-neighborhoods, i.e., if and only if |AX(2R)| is
ﬁnite.
Proof.
This result for 3R-neighborhoods can be proved similarly to Theorem 2.1. A
proof for 2R-neighborhoods appears in Theorem 2.1 of part I.
We clarify the relation between translation and isometry local isomorphism classes
[[X]]T and [[X]]E in the next two lemmas. Recall that for a collection of sets X the
group Psym(X) is the set of rotations Q ∈O(n, R) for which QX = X.

354
J. C. Lagarias
Lemma 2.2.
Suppose that X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn. Then the group
Psym([[X]]T ) of rotations that leave [[X]]T invariant is ﬁnite.
Proof.
Pick Y ∈[[X]]T with 0 ∈Y. If Q ∈Psym([[X]]T ), then QY ∈[[X]]T as
Q(PX(0; 2R)) must be in the 2R-atlas AX(2R). Now PX(0; 2R) is an enclosing set of
0, so the isometry Q is uniquely determined by the images of the points in PX(0; 2R).
Since |AX(2R)| is ﬁnite, and each patch in AX(2R) contains ﬁnitely many points, there
are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for Q.
An ideal crystal X in Rn is any set that consists of a ﬁnite number of translates of a
full rank lattice in Rn. In this case Psym([[X]]T ) is the point group of the ideal crystal
X, and it is well known that there is an upper bound on the order |Psym([[X]]T )| that
depends only on the dimension n. This fact does not hold for general Delone sets of ﬁnite
type; in each dimension n ≥2 one can construct examples X in which |Psym([[X]]T )|
is arbitrarily large.
For any Delone set X in Rn, we have the inclusion
O(n, R)[[X]]T ⊆[[X]]E,
(2.6)
in which O(n, R) is the orthogonal group in Rn. We say that X is rigid if equality holds
in (2.6).
Lemma 2.3.
Any Delone set X in Rn of ﬁnite type is rigid. That is,
[[X]]E = O(n, R)[[X]]T .
(2.7)
Proof.
Let Y ∈[[X]]E, and without loss of generality we may translate Y so that 0 ∈Y.
We wish to show that there exists Q ∈O(n, R) and ˜X ∈[[X]]T such that
Y = Q ˜X.
Since each T -neighborhood of Y around 0 is isometric to some T -neighborhood of X,
for each integer k > R we can ﬁnd Qk ∈O(n, R) and xk ∈X such that
Y ∩B(0; k) = Qk(X −xk) ∩B(0; k),
(2.8)
and, in particular,
Y ∩B(0; R) = Qk(X −xk) ∩B(0, R).
(2.9)
Fix k0 = ⌊R⌋+ 1. For any k ≥k0, the last equality gives
(X −xk) ∩B(0; R) = Q−1

ask variesoverallk ≥k0.Toseethis,noteﬁrstthattheﬁniteset X0 := (X−xk0)∩B(0; R)
is an enclosing set because X is R-relatively dense. It follows that the points {x ∈X0}
span Rn, hence the image x →Qx for x ∈X0 determines Q uniquely. Second, the set
(X −X) ∩B(0; R) is a ﬁnite set because X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type. Now for each
x −xk0 ∈X0 there exists x′ ∈X such that
y′ := x′ −xk = Q(x −xk0),
hence
y′ ∈(X −xk) ∩B(0; R) ⊆(X −X) ∩B(0; R).
There are only ﬁnitely many maps ϕ: X0 →(X −X) ∩B(0; R), hence there are only
ﬁnitely many choices for Q.
We can now pick an inﬁnite subsequence {kj : 1 ≤j ≤∞} with kj →∞on which
Qkj = Q is constant. We then have
Y ∩B(0; kj) = Q(X −xkj) ∩B(0; kj),
all
j ≥1.
(2.11)
The pointwise limit
˜X := lim
j→∞(X −xkj) ∩B(0; kj)
is a well-deﬁned set by (2.11). Clearly, ˜X ∈[[X]]T , and (2.11) implies that Y = Q ˜X.

Local Rules
We use the term “local rules” to describe a set of local restrictions on the points in a
Delone set X.
Deﬁnition 3.1.
(i) A set of local rules L of radius ρ is a ﬁnite collection of discrete
sets {Yi} containing 0 which are contained in the open ball B(0; ρ).
(ii) A set X satisﬁes the local rules L under isometries if each ρ-neighborhood
PX(x; ρ) of X is isometric to a set in L under an isometry that sends x to 0. We set
6E(L) := {Y : Y satisﬁes L under isometries}.
(3.1)
(iii) A set X satisﬁes the local rules L (under translations) if each ρ-neighborhood
PX(x; ρ) of X when translated to 0 is a set in L. We set
6T (L) := {Y : Y satisﬁes L under translations}.
(3.2)
Note that if Y ∈6E(L), then its local isomorphism class [[Y]]E ⊆6E(L). Further-
more, 6E(L) is closed downward under the ordering ≤E, namely, if [[Y]]E ⊆6E(L)
and [[Y ′]]E ≤E [[Y]]E, then [[Y ′]]E ⊆6E(L). It follows that if 6E(L) = [[X]]E, then
X is isometry-minimal.
We similarly have that if Y ∈6T (L), then [[Y]]T ⊆6T (L), and 6T (L) is closed
downward under the ordering ≤T . It follows that if 6T (L) = [[X]]T , then X is minimal.

The property of being a Delone set is enforceable by local rules under isometries. We
say that a set of local rules L of radius ρ ≥R is strongly R-enclosing if 0 is a strongly
enclosed R-point of each Yi ∈L.
Lemma 3.1.
Let L be a set of local rules, of radius ρ ≥R, such that L is strongly
R-enclosing. Then any set X that satisﬁes L under isometries is a Delone set whose
relative denseness constant is at most R.
Proof.
First, X is uniformly discrete, because there is a lower bound r of closeness
between any two points in any Yi in L, because L is ﬁnite. Second, to show that X
is relatively dense with constant R, we argue by contradiction. Suppose not, and take
some empty ball B(z; T ) with T ≥R. Choose a point x ∈X that is a closest point to
z and translate the ball in the direction x −z until x is on its boundary. By the triangle
inequality, the resulting ball B(z′; T ) contains no point of X\{x}, for any such point
would be closer to z than to x. This contradicts x being an R-point of X, which it must
be since L is strongly R-enclosing.
This result immediately extends to give local rules that enforce the property of being
a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type.
Lemma 3.2.
Let L be a set of local rules of radius ρ ≥3R, such that each set Yi in
L is strongly R-enclosing. Then any set X that satisﬁes L under isometries is a Delone
set of isometry-ﬁnite type. Conversely, if X is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type, then
its set L of centered 3R-stars is a set of local rules in which each set Yi in L is strongly
R-enclosing.
Proof.
By Lemma 3.1 X is a Delone set with relative denseness constant R. Since
ρ ≥3R and all its 3R-stars are isometric to sets in L, it follows from Theorem 2.1 that
X is of isometry-ﬁnite type.
There is an analogous result for local rules under translations.
Lemma 3.3.
Let L be a set of local rules of radius ρ ≥2R, such that each Yi ∈L
is strongly R-enclosing. Then any set X that satisﬁes L under translations is a Delone
set of ﬁnite type. Conversely, if L is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, then its set L of centered
2R-patches is a set of local rules in which each Yi in L is strongly R-enclosing.
Proof.
Similar to Lemma 3.2, using Theorem 2.2 instead of Theorem 2.1.
Lemma 3.2 shows that for each Delone set of ﬁnite type X there exists a set of local
rules L with the property that the set 6E(L) contains only Delone sets of isometry-ﬁnite
type. To prove that for a speciﬁc L all elements of 6E(L) are Delone sets of ﬁnite
type requires proving a ﬁniteness result for the set of all rotations used in applying the
elements of L. This appears to be a nontrivial problem, because for some Delone sets of
ﬁnite type X in Rn the set of rotations Psym([X −X]) that leave the Z-module [X −X]

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
357
invariant may contain elements of inﬁnite order if n ≥2, and may be inﬁnitely generated
if n ≥3, see [47] and [39].
We give below sufﬁcient conditions on a set of local rules L for every set in 6E(L)
to be a Delone set of ﬁnite type. These conditions force every set X ∈6E(L) to contain
a relatively dense set of copies of a particular ﬁnite conﬁguration 1 under isometries,
such that these copies occur only in a ﬁnite number of orientations.
Deﬁnition 3.2.
Let 1 be a ﬁnite set in Rn and let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of O(n, R).
We say that 1 is a watermark with respect to G for a set of local rules L under isometries
if:
(i) 0 ∈1 and 0 is a T -enclosed point of 1 for some T ≤1
2ρ, where ρ is the radius
of the local rules L. Call 0 the center of 1.
(ii) Each Yi ∈L contains an isometric copy of 1 in Yi ∩B(0; ρ −T ).
(iii) A set Yi ∈L is 1-centered if it contains an isometric copy of 1 centered at 0,
i.e., it contains 1′ = Q1 for some Q ∈O(n, R). For each 1-centered Yi, every
isometric copy 1′′ of 1′ contained in Yi satisﬁes
1′′ = Q′′1′ + t′′,
with
Q′′ ∈G
and
t′′ ∈Rn.
(3.3)
(iv) For each 1-centered Yi in L, the centers {t′′} of all isometric copies of 1 contain
0 as a strongly 1
2ρ-enclosed point.
A 1-centered Yi may contain several distinct copies 1′ of 1 centered at 0, and these
copies must differ by elements of G. In particular, the group G must contain the group
Psym(1). (The T -enclosing property of 1 guarantees that Psym(1) is a ﬁnite group.) In
principle, one can check by a ﬁnite computation5 whether a ﬁnite set L has some (1, G)
such that 1 is a watermark with respect to G for L.
Deﬁnition 3.3.
Let a ﬁnite set L have a pair (1, G) as a watermark. We deﬁne the
normalization L1 of L with respect to (1, G) to be the set of local rules obtained from
L by replacing each 1-centered Yi by the set of all QYi for Q in O(n, R) such that QYi
contains 1 centered at 0.
It is clear that the normalization L1 is a ﬁnite set and that the local rules L and L1
under isometries give the same sets.
Theorem 3.1.
If L is a set of local rules of radius ρ that contains a watermark 1 with
respect to G, then
6E(L) = O(n, R)6T (GL1),
(3.4)
so that 6E(L) consists entirely of Delone sets of ﬁnite type. Furthermore, each

Rn are equal.

J. C. Lagarias
X ∈6E(L) contains a relatively dense set of isometric copies of 1 and has
Psym([[X]]T ) ⊆G.
(3.5)
Proof.
The inclusion
O(n, R)6T (GL1) ⊆6E(L)
(3.6)
is clear. For the other direction, suppose that X ∈6E(L). Since by property (ii) of
Deﬁnition 3.2 each rule Yi ∈L contains an isometric copy 1′ of 1, so does X. For
convenience, we ﬁrst shift X by a global isometry to ˜X = QX + t, in such a way that
1′ is moved to 1, and view 1 as “marked” in ˜X. It sufﬁces to prove that ˜X is a Delone
set of ﬁnite type.
Let L1 be the normalization of L and set
˜L1 := GL1 = {gY : Y ∈L1, g ∈G}.
(3.7)
We show that ˜X can be built up using local rules from ˜L1 under translations, starting
from the “marked” set 1 centered at 0. We proceed by induction on the number of
“marked” isometric copies of 1. The ρ-neighborhood of 0 is isometric to some set in L,
necessarily 1-centered, hence it must be equal to some set in ˜L1, according to property
(iii) of Deﬁnition 3.2. Now (3.3) implies that every isometric copy of 1 in B(0; ρ) is
translation-equivalent to
Q1
for some
Q ∈G.
(3.8)
We “mark” all these copies of 1 having centers within distance 1
2ρ of 0, and let their
center locations form a list C1 of eligible 1-centers, and let the “already inspected” list
M1 = {0}. The induction hypothesis will be that Ck is nonempty and only includes
centers of copies of 1 that satisfy (3.8). At the (k + 1)st stage we take the ﬁrst element
of the list xk, and ﬁnd an element of L that agrees with ˜X on its ρ-neighborhood. This
element xk is in ˜L1 and by the induction hypothesis it is translation-equivalent to an
element of ˜L1, since G is a group. Let Ck+1 be obtained from Ck by removing xk and
adding any new 1-centers within distance 1
2ρ of x to the end of this list. We update the
“already inspected” list to Mk+1 = Mk ∪{xk}. Any new 1-centers added to Ck+1 satisfy
(3.8) by condition (iii) of Deﬁnition 3.2. The ordered list Ck+1 cannot be empty, for if
it were, then Mk+1 would have the property that every element in it was a 1
2ρ-point,
by property (iv) of Deﬁnition 3.2. Then Lemma 2.1 implies that Mk+1 is 1
2ρ-relatively
dense, hence inﬁnite, which contradicts |Mk+1| = k + 1. Now consider the complete
“eventually inspected” set
˜
M :=
∞
[
k=1
Mk =
∞
[
k=1
Ck.
Every element of ˜
M is a 1-center of ˜X, and by property (iv) of Deﬁnition 3.2 xk ∈Mk
is a 1
2ρ-enclosed point of Mk ∪Ck+1 Thus every point of M is 1
2ρ-enclosed, hence by
Lemma 2.1
˜
M is 1
2ρ-relatively dense.. However, each element of ˜X is speciﬁed by an

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
359
element of ˜L1 centered at X, of radius ρ. Since all elements of
˜
M are 1-centered and
satisfy (3.8), the same holds for every isometric copy ˜1 of 1 centered at x′ ∈˜X, by
virtue of property (iii) of Deﬁnition 3.2 applied at some x ∈
˜
M, with ||x′ −x|| ≤1
2δ.
The ρ-stars at all x ∈
˜
M cover ˜X and are each a translate of an element of ˜L1, hence ˜X
contains only ﬁnitely many classes of ρ-stars under translation. Since ˜X is Delone with
relative denseness constant R ≤1
2ρ, it is a Delone set of ﬁnite type by Theorem 2.2.
Finally, 1 is an enclosing set, so the image of its points under an isometry determines
the isometry uniquely. Since all isometric copies of 1 in any set X satisfy (3.8), we must
have
Psym([[X]]T ) ⊆G,
as required.
Remarks.
(1) In Section 4 we show that any Delone set of ﬁnite type that is minimal
satisﬁes a set of local rules L having a watermark (1, G) to which Theorem 3.1 applies.
(2) We deﬁned “watermark” above so that every isometric copy of 1 in X is “marked.”
One can prove a strengthening of Theorem 3.1 in which only some copies of 1 are
“marked,” by changing the deﬁnition of “watermark” (Deﬁnition 3.2(iii)) to have (3.3)
apply only to those copies 1′′ for which |t| = ri for some ﬁxed set of radius values
0 = r0 < r1 < · · · < rm < ρ −T,
(3.9)
and by changing Deﬁnition 3.2(iv) that 0 be a 1
2ρ-enclosed point of the set of all {t′′}
with |t′′| = ri for some i, 0 ≤i ≤m.
4.
Minimality
The notion of “minimality” arose in topological dynamics. The introduction of ergodic
theory in lattice gas models in statistical mechanics goes back to work of Ruelle and
Sinai around 1970. Later Radin [48], [49], [51], [53] pioneered the use of dynamical
systems with a Zn-action, Rn-action, or an En-action in studying the structure of “ground
states,” for tilings and quasicrystalline structures. Dynamical systems with an Rn-action
were used in studying tiling models for quasicrystalline structures in [55] and [59], and
dynamical systems with an En-action were used in [54].
Recall that a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type X is deﬁned to be isometry-minimal
if [[X]]E is minimal in the partial ordering ≤E, and that a Delone set of ﬁnite type X is
deﬁned to be minimal if [[X]]T is minimal in the partial ordering ≤T . The ﬁrst part of
this section relates these two types of minimality to topological dynamical systems with
an En-action and an Rn-action, respectively (Theorems 4.1 and 4.2). These equivalences
are standard in the dynamical systems literature, and are included here to make the paper
self-contained. The second part of this section shows for Delone sets of ﬁnite type that
these two concepts of minimality coincide (Theorem 4.3), and then applies this result to
prove Theorem 1.1.
We ﬁrst give several equivalent conditions for isometry-minimality.

360
J. C. Lagarias
Deﬁnition 4.1.
(i) A Delone set X is isometry-repetitive if for each positive T there is
a radius R′ depending on T such that each R′-neighborhood of X contains an isometric
copy of each T -star of X.
(ii) The isometry-repetivity function ME
X(T ) of X is the function that gives the least
such value of R′ for each T > 0.
This deﬁnition is equivalent to X being a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type, such that
the set of isometric copies of any T -star occurring in X is relatively dense.
We construct a topological dynamical system with an En-action associated to an
arbitrary Delone set X. Let Dr,R be the collection of all Delone sets with parameters
(r, R). We topologize Dr,R using the natural topology, which is deﬁned by a metric
dist(X, ˜X) :=
X
x∈X
2−||x|| dist(x, ˜X) +
X
˜x∈˜X
2−||˜x|| dist(˜x, X).
(4.1)
That is, two Delone sets X and ˜X are close in this metric if in some large ball of radius T
around the origin the points of X and ˜X are in one-to-one correspondence, with each pair
of points separated by distance at most ε. It is easy to check that this is a metric, and that
Dr,R is a complete metric space and is compact. (That is, every sequence {xk : k ≥1} has
a limit point in Dr,R.) Note also that Dr,R is invariant under the action of the Euclidean
group En of all isometries.
Deﬁnition 4.2.
(i) Given a Delone set X, let OE(X) denote the orbit of X under
isometries En, i.e.,
OE(X) := {ϕ(X) : ϕ ∈En}.
(4.2)
(ii) The isometry orbit closure 6E(X) is the closure of OE(X) in the natural topology,
i.e.,
6E(X) := OE(X).
(4.3)
Since OE(X) ⊆Dr,R, the set 6E(X) is a compact set in the natural topology. Thus we
obtain a topological dynamical system (6E(X), En) with an En-action.
Now suppose that X is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type. For these sets the closure
process yielding 6E(X) introduces no new T -neighborhoods, for any T > 0.
Lemma 4.1.
If X is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type, then
6E(X) = [[X]]E =
[
[[Y]]E≤E[[X]]E
[[Y]]E.
(4.4)
Proof.
By deﬁnition 6E(X) = [[X]]E, because any element Y of 6E(X) is the limit
in the natural topology of isometric copies of larger and larger stars of X, and all these
T -stars occur in any element of [[X]]E. Any T -star in Y is isometric to some T -star in X,
because there are only ﬁnitely many T -stars up to isometry, so in any Cauchy sequence in

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
361
the natural topology the approximating T -star becomes constant, up to isometry, hence
the limit T -star is isometric to a T -star of X. Thus
6E(X) ⊆
[
[[Y]]E≤E[[X]]E
[[Y]]E.
Conversely any element in such [[Y]]E with [[Y]]E ≤E [[X]]E is the limit in the natural
topology of isometric copies of larger and larger patches of X, hence [[Y]]E ⊆6E(X),
so (4.4) follows.
Deﬁnition 4.3.
Thetopologicaldynamicalsystem(6E(X), En)isminimalunderisome-
tries if every En-orbit of 6E(X) is dense.
We prove the following characterization of isometry-minimality.
Theorem 4.1.
If X is a Delone set of isometry-ﬁnite type, then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(i) [[X]]E is isometry-minimal.
(ii) The topological dynamical system (6E(X), En) is minimal, i.e., [[X]]E is a
closed set.
(iii) X is isometry-repetitive. That is, for each T -star P of X the set XE(P) deﬁned
by
XE(P) := {x′ ∈X : PX(x′; T ) = ϕ(P) for some isometry ϕ}
(4.5)
is relatively dense.
Proof.
(i) ⇔(ii) By Lemma 4.1 [[X]]E is isometry-minimal means that 6E(X) =
[[X]]E. For any X′ ∈[[X]]E we have by deﬁnition 6E(X′) = 6E(X), hence every
orbit closure 6E(X′) is the whole space. If to the contrary 6E(X) ̸= [[X]]E, then by
Lemma 4.1 there is some [[X′]]E <E [[X]]E, so that
6E(X′) =
[
[[Y]]E≤E[[X′]]E
[[Y]]E ⫋6E(X),
hence X′ does not have a dense orbit in (6E(X), En).
(i) ⇒(iii) We prove the contrapositive. If for some T -star P there are no isometric
copies of P in arbitrarily large regions of X, say in (X −xi) ∩B(0; Ti) with Ti →∞
as i →∞, we can translate these regions to the origin and extract a subsequence that
converges in the natural topology to a limit set Y that contains no isometric copy of P.
Thus [[Y]]E <E [[X]]E, so [[X]]E is not minimal under isometries.
(ii) ⇒(i) Given a T -star P in X, by (iii) there is a radius T ′ such that every T ′-star
of X contains an isometric copy of P. Thus given any Y ∈[[X]]E, since each T ′-patch
in Y is isometric to a T ′-patch of X, it contains an isometric copy of P. This holds for
all P, so Y ∈[[X]]E. Thus 6E(X) = [[X]]E = [[X]]E, which is therefore isometry-
minimal.

362
J. C. Lagarias
Our next object is to derive several equivalent conditions for minimality under trans-
lations.
Deﬁnition 4.4.
(i) A Delone set X is repetitive if for each radius T > 0 there is a ﬁnite
value MX(T ) such that each MX(T )-neighborhood of X contains a translate of each
T -patch of X.
(ii) The repetitivity function MX(T ) of X is the smallest such value for each T > 0.
A Delone set X is repetitive if and only if it is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, such that
the set of occurrences of each T -patch in X is relatively dense.
We next construct a topological dynamical system with an Rn-action associated to a
given Delone set X, analogous to the construction in [50].
Deﬁnition 4.5.
(i) Given a Delone set X, let OT (X) denote the orbit of X under
translations T n, i.e.,
OT (X) := {X + t : t ∈Rn}.
(ii) The translation orbit closure 6T (X) is the closure of OT (X) in the natural
topology, i.e.,
6T (X) := OT (X).
(4.6)
We obtain a topological dynamical system (6T (X), Rn) with an Rn-action.
Lemma 4.2.
If X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, then
6T (X) = [[X]]T =
[
[[Y]]T ≤T [[X]]T
[[Y]]T .
(4.7)
Proof.
Similar to Lemma 4.1.
Deﬁnition 4.6.
The topological dynamical system (6T (X), Rn) is minimal if every
Rn-orbit of 6T (X) is dense.
Theorem 4.2.
If X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn, then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(i) [[X]]T is minimal.
(ii) The topological dynamical system (6T (X), Rn) is minimal.
(iii) X is repetitive. That is, for each centered T-patch P of X, the set XT (P) deﬁned
by
XT (P) = {x′ ∈X : PX(x; T ) = P + t for some t ∈Rn}
(4.8)
is relatively dense.
Proof.
Similar to Theorem 4.1.

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
363
We next relate minimality under translations to minimality under isometries, as
follows.
Theorem 4.3.
If X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, then [[X]]E is isometry-minimal if and
only if [[X]]T is minimal.
Proof.
Since X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, Lemma 2.3 gives
[[X]]E = O(n, R)[[X]]T .
(4.9)
Suppose ﬁrst that [[X]]T is minimal, so that [[X]]T is a closed set in the natural
topology. To show that [[X]]E is isometry-minimal we check that it is closed in the
natural topology. So suppose that
Y = lim
j→∞Qj(X −xj),
with Qj ∈O(n, R). We can extract a subsequence with Qjk →Q, and
Y = lim
k→∞Qjk(X −xjk) = lim
k→∞Q(X −xjk),
using the Delone property of X. Thus
˜X = Q−1Y = lim
k→∞(X −xjk) ∈[[X]]T ,
because [[X]]T is closed. Now Y ∈[[X]]E by (4.9).
Now suppose that [[X]]E is isometry-minimal, so that it is a closed set in the natural
topology. If [[X]]T is not minimal, then there is some minimal set [[X′]]T contained in
[[X]]T . (This is a standard fact in topological dynamics, proved by Zorn’s lemma.) Now
the set X′ ∈[[X]]E is dense in [[X]]E and Lemma 2.3 gives
[[X]]T ⊆[[X]]E = [[X′]]E = O(n, R)[[X′]]T .
There is some subset G ⊆O(n, R) such that [[X]]T = G[[X′]]T . Consider a patch P of
X′ of radius R, which is therefore an enclosing set. Each image {g(P) : g ∈G} must be
a patch of X, and if g ̸= g′, then the action g and g′ on the points of the patch P cannot
be identical because P is an enclosing set. Any Delone set of ﬁnite type contains only
ﬁnitely many translation-inequivalent T -patches for any T , see Theorem 2.2 of [34]. It
follows that G is a ﬁnite set. Thus
[[X]]T =
|G|
[
i=1
gi[[X′]]T
is a closed set in the natural topology, since [[X′]]T is closed. Now [[X]]T is minimal
by Theorem 4.1. (It follows that [[X]]T = [[X′]]T and |G| = 1.)
We now turn to the proof of Theorem 1.1, which is based on constructing a watermark
with G = Psym([[X]]T ). We need a preliminary lemma. If P is a centered ρ-patch of a
set X, let
Psym(P) := {Q ∈O(n, R) : QP ∈AX(ρ)}.
(4.10)

364
J. C. Lagarias
We always have
Psym([[X]]T ) ⊆Psym(P).
(4.11)
The following lemma gives conditions where equality occurs.
Lemma 4.3.
Let X be a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn which is minimal. There is a
radius ρ0 depending on X, with ρ0 ≥R, such that if ρ ≥ρ0, then every ρ-patch P
satisﬁes
Psym(P) = Psym([[X]]T ).
(4.12)
Proof.
If ρ ≥R, then every centered ρ-patch is an enclosing set of 0, hence Psym(P)
is a ﬁnite group. We ﬁrst show there is no group of rotations G′ that strictly contains G
such that
G′ ⊆Psym(P)
for all patches P.
(4.13)
Suppose there were. Now G′ must be ﬁnite, and (4.13) would imply that for each g′ ∈G′
and X′ ∈[[X]]T one has g′X′ ∈[[X]]T , because every patch of g′X′ is translation-
equivalent to a patch of X by (4.10) and (4.13). Thus G′ ⊆Psym([[X]]T ), which is a
contradiction. It follows that we have
\
P
Psym(P) = Psym([[X]]T ).
Now take any ﬁxed patch P0 of radius R and since Psym(P0) is a ﬁnite group, we
can ﬁnd a ﬁnite set of patches P1, . . . , Pk, where Pi is a ρi-patch with ρi ≥R, such that
if g′ ∈Psym(P0)\G, then g′ ̸∈Psym(Pi) for some i with 1 ≤i ≤k. All these patches,
including P0, are of radius at most
ρ′ := max{ρi : 1 ≤i ≤k}.
(4.14)
Since X is minimal, by Theorem 4.2(iii) it follows for any ρ ≥MX(ρ′) that any ρ-patch
P contains a translate of each of the patches P0, P1, . . . , Pk. Now (4.12) holds for such
a patch P, because any rotation that maps P to a legal ρ-patch must simultaneously map
each translate of Pi to a translate of a similarly rotated legal ρi-patch.
Proof of Theorem 1.1.

Our object is to show that, for any sufﬁciently large value of ρ, the set L = Lρ of all
translation-equivalence classes of ρ-patches of X has a watermark (1, G), in which
G = Psym([[X]]T ). If so, then Theorem 1.1 will follow from Theorem 3.1.
We apply Lemma 4.3, and take for 1 any centered patch P for which (4.12) holds.
Let it be of radius T , with T ≥R, and then P is R-enclosing, hence T -enclosing. We
claim that the pair (1, G) is a watermark for the set L = Lρ of all ρ-patches with
ρ := 2MX(T ).
(4.15)
Now MX(T ) ≥T trivially, hence we have T ≤1
2ρ, so property (i) of Deﬁnition 3.2
holds. Property (ii) of Deﬁnition 3.2 holds by deﬁnition of the repetitivity function.

Property (iii) of Deﬁnition 3.2 holds by (4.12). Property (iv) of Deﬁnition 3.2 holds
because, by deﬁnition of MX(T ), the set of centers of translated copies of any T -patch
is relatively dense with constant at most MX(T ), so that any 2MX(T )-patch centered at
a point x ∈X which is the center of 1 has translates that are strongly MX(T )-enclosing,
by Lemma 2.1(ii).

Perfect Local Rules
Most of the explicit constructions of quasicrystalline structures by “local rules” in the
literature involve perfect local rules.
Deﬁnition 5.1.
(i) A set of local rules L are perfect local rules under isometries if all X
that satisfy L are Delone sets of isometry-ﬁnite type that fall in a single local isomorphism
class [[X]]E under isometries, which is necessarily isometry-minimal. That is,
6E(L) = [[X]]E.
(5.1)
We say that X has perfect local rules under isometries if [[X]]E does.
(ii) A set of local rules L are perfect local rules under translations if all X that satisfy
L under translations are Delone sets of ﬁnite type and fall in single local isomorphism
class [[X]]T , which is necessarily minimal. That is,
6T (L) = [[X]]T .
(5.2)
We say that X has perfect local rules under translations if [[X]]T does.
The main result of this section is to show that for Delone sets of ﬁnite type these two
concepts of perfect local rules coincide. We prove the two implications separately.
Theorem 5.1.
Let X be a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn. If X has perfect local rules
under isometries, then X has perfect local rules under translations.
Proof.
Since X has perfect local rules under isometries, it is isometry-minimal. Because
X is a Delone set of ﬁnite type, it is minimal by Theorem 4.3.
Suppose that there is a set L of perfect local rules under isometries for X of radius T .
We let Lρ denote the set of centered ρ-patches of X, which is a ﬁnite set because X is
of ﬁnite type. Now Lemma 2.3 gives
[[X]]E = O(n, R)[[X]]T .
(5.3)
If ρ ≥T , then any set X′ that satisﬁes Lρ under translations also satisﬁes L under
isometries. Thus it is contained in [[X]]E, hence is of the form
X′ = Q ˜X
for some
Q ∈O(n, R)
and
˜X ∈[[X]]T .
(5.4)
By translating X′ and ˜X we may reduce to the case that 0 ∈X′. Since ρ ≥T ≥R, the
patch P = P(0; ρ) of X′ strongly R-encloses 0, and by hypothesis is contained in Lρ.

366
J. C. Lagarias
Now (5.4) yields
Q ⊆Psym(P),
whichisaﬁnitegroup.Since X isminimal,byLemma4.3thereisaconstantρ0 depending
on X such that, for all ρ ≥ρ0, every ρ-patch P has
Psym(P) = Psym([[X]]T ).
Now (5.3) gives for ρ ≥max(ρ0, T ) that
X′ ∈Psym([[X]]T )[[X]]T = [[X]]T ,
hence Lρ is a set of perfect local rules under translations.
It seems reasonable to conjecture that if a set X has perfect local rules under isometries
of radius ρ, then it has perfect local rules under translations for the same radius ρ.
We now prove a converse result.
Theorem 5.2.
Let X be a Delone set of ﬁnite type in Rn. If X has perfect local rules
under translations, then it has perfect local rules under isometries.
Proof.
We prove this result using a watermark (1, G), where G = Psym([[X]]T ). Let
X have perfect local rules under translations of radius T , say, and note that X is minimal.
Then by Lemma 4.3 there exists a constant ρ0 ≥2R such that for all ρ ≥ρ0 every
ρ-patch P of X has Psym(P) = G. Let L consist of all ρ1-patches of X with
ρ1 := max(2MX(ρ0), T ).
(5.5)
Here ρ1 is ﬁnite since X is minimal.
We will show that L is a set of perfect local rules under isometries for X. To prove
this, let 1 be a ﬁxed centered ρ0-patch of X. Since ρ1 ≥2MX(ρ0), the set L contains
(1, G) as a watermark. The watermark property is established by the same proof as in
Theorem 1.1.
Suppose next that Z ∈6E(L). Then Z contains an isometric copy ˜1 of 1, so take an
isometry ˜Z = QZ +t that moves ˜1 to 1. Now by deﬁnition of MX(ρ0) the set of centers
of isometric copies ˜1 of 1 in any 1-centered element of L form an MX(ρ0)-enclosing
set of 0. We now claim that every isometric copy ˜1 of 1 in ˜Z satisﬁes
˜1 = Q1 + t,
for some
Q ∈G
and
t ∈Rn.
(5.6)
We prove this claim by an inductive proof similar to that used in the proof of Theorem 3.1.
Each point ˜z ∈˜Z that is a center of some ˜1 must have as a ρ1-patch some ˜QYi + t for
some Yi ∈L. If this ρ1-patch contains some region ˜1∗that satisﬁes (5.6), then ˜QYi must
be correctly oriented to match the orientation of ˜1∗. Since ˜1∗is an enclosing set, this
forces ˜Q ∈G, hence ˜QYi ∈L because the set of centered ρ1-patches of X is invariant
under Psym([[X]]T ) = G. Thus (5.6) must hold for every isometric copy of 1 in this
ρ1-patch. By an induction starting from the original set 1 centered at 0, we obtain by

Geometric Models for Quasicrystals, II
367
induction on lists Ck, Mk that every isometric copy ˜1 of 1 in ˜Z satisﬁes (5.6), and
furthermore the rules of L under isometries that were applied at points ˜z, were actually
applied using translations. Since X has perfect local rules under translations, and since
ρ1 ≥T , this yields
˜Z ∈6T (L) = [[X]]T .
It follows that
Z ∈O(n, R)6T (L) ≡O(n, R)[[X]]T .
By Lemma 2.3 this gives Z ∈[[X]]E, hence 6E(L) = [[X]]E.
Remark.
To get an explicit bound on the radius ρ1 for local rules under isometry
needed in Theorem 5.2, an upper bound for the order of the group G = Psym([[X]]T )
and upper bounds on the repetitivity function MX(ρ) are needed. An explicit bound for
ρ1 for the case of ideal crystals X is given in [15], namely, ρ1 = 2n2 log2(R/r + 2)Rk,
where k is the number of points in a unit cell of X.

Local Rules and Matching Rules for Tilings
Much of the work on quasicrystalline structures has been formulated in terms of tiling
models of quasicrystals. There is a considerable body of work on “local rules” and
“matching rules” for tilings, see [42], [30], [31], and [57]. These concepts of “local
rules” are intended to enforce speciﬁc properties in all the tilings that satisfy them: these
properties may include being a Meyer set or cut-and-project set6 or being in a single
local isomorphism class (perfect local rules as deﬁned in this paper). Below we give
more precise equivalences. Much literature on local rules and matching rules of tilings
requires that such rules enforce nonperiodicity of any structure X that satisﬁes them,
e.g., Deﬁnition 7.1 of [57]. We make no such requirement here.
We consider tilings of Rn by translations of a ﬁnite set F of prototiles, each of which
is a convex polytope. For example, the Voronoi domains associated to the points of a
Delone set of ﬁnite type give such a ﬁnite set F of prototiles, see Theorem 2.2 of [34].
To any such tiling T we associate the vertex set V (T ) which consists of all vertices of
the polytopes in the tiling, and the centroid set C(T ) which consists of the centroids7
(centers of gravity) of all polytopes in the tiling. It is easy to show that V (T ) and C(T )
are always Delone sets of ﬁnite type.
6 The term quasiperiodic tiling is used by some authors to mean that the tiling has a pure point component in
their diffraction spectrum, whose support is contained in a Z-module of ﬁnite rank, see [21] and [43]. However,
the constructions given typically produce cut-and-project sets, which are known to have pure discrete spectrum.
7 If the polytopes are centrally symmetric, the centroid is the center of symmetry. Thus for a Delone set of
ﬁnite type X, we have X = C(T ) where T is the tiling given by its Voronoi domains.

Much work in the literature is restricted to the special case in which the prototile set
F consists of all zonotopes generated by all subsets of n linearly independent vectors
formed from a collection of s vectors {v1, v2, . . . , vs} in Rn. Assuming all these vectors
are linearly independent, there are
¡n
s
¢
such zonotopes, given by
PI := {x1vi1 + x2vi2 + · · · + xnvin : 0 ≤xi ≤1},
for
I = {i1, . . . , in},
where I = {i1, i2, . . . , in} ⊆{1, 2, . . . , s}. We call any tiling of Rn using such prototiles
a zonotope tiling.
Several notions of local rules were introduced by Levitov [42] for zonotope tilings. A
set of r-rules L consists of a ﬁnite list of patches of contiguous tiles, each of which ﬁts
completely inside a ball of radius r. A (zonotope) quasicrystal8 is any zonotope tiling
T , resulting from a cut-and-project construction from the lattice Zs, which is deﬁned
using a ﬁxed linear embedding L: Rn →Rs which we call the supporting map for T
and a vector c ∈Rs which we call the offset vector. Here T has vertex set V (T ) given by
orthogonal projection of the vertices of the unit cubes in Zn which intersect the translated
subspace L(Rn) + c onto L(Rn), and we identify L(Rn) with Rn using L. Levitov says
that a zonotope tiling T has strong local rules if its set of r-rules L for some ﬁxed r has
the following properties:
(i) T is a zonotope quasicrystal.
(ii) Every zonotope tiling that satisﬁes L is a zonotope quasicrystal with the same
supporting map L: Rn →Rs, but possibly a different offset vector.
This deﬁnition implies that the vertex set V (T ) has perfect local rules in the sense of
Section 5, provided that the projection of the lattice generated by the zonotope vertices on
internal space Rs−n is dense; otherwise there are uncountably many local isomorphism
classes of zonotope tilings, depending on the offset vector.
Levitov [42] says that a zonotope tiling T has weak local rules if its set of r-rules L
for some ﬁxed r has the following properties:
(i) T is a zonotope quasicrystal.
(ii) Every zonotope tiling that satisﬁes L has vertex set V (T ) that is a projection of
a subset of Zn onto L(Rs) + c that consists only of points at most a constant
distance from L(Rs) + c.
Condition (ii) says the vertex set V (T ′) of any tiling T ′ that satisﬁes L is a Meyer set
which has support function L, see Theorem 3.1 of [34]. Burkov [6] shows that a certain
eight-fold symmetric parallelogram tiling of R2 does not have weak local rules in this
sense. Ingersent [29] further reﬁnes this classiﬁcation of local rules.
Le and Sadov (see p. 72 of [39]) introduce related concepts. Their deﬁnition of set of
local rules based on atlases corresponds to a set of local rules under translations for the
centroid set C(T ). They also deﬁne local rules based on colorings, which are a special
case of matching rules, as deﬁned below.

of a ﬁnite list of ways that adjacent tiles with the markings can be legally arranged
(under translations). Sometimes matching rules are prescribed as colorings of vertices or
faces of the polyhedra, with a requirement that colorings on immediately adjacent tiles
must match; these can be formulated as vertex colorings. These deﬁnitions have been
formulated as restrictions on immediately adjacent tiles (as in a jigsaw puzzle) but we
may obviously generalize them to allow a ﬁnite list of legal colorings of larger r-patches
that include nonadjacent tiles. We call these generalized matching rules. The effect of
matching rules is to narrow the class of allowed tilings.
A notion of equivalence of different tilings called mutual local derivability was in-
troduced by Baake and Schlottmann [4], [3]. A tiling T2 is said to be locally derivable
from a tiling T1 if there is an isometric9 copy T ′
1 = QT1 + t and if there is a radius R′
such that the location of the tiles of T2 in the ball B(x, 3R) is entirely determined by
the patch of T ′
1 in the ball B(x; R′), where R is the diameter of the largest tile in T2.
Two tilings T1 and T2 are mutually locally derivable if each is locally derivable from
the other. An MLD-class of tilings, denoted MLD(T ), is the set of all tilings mutually
locally derivable from T . It is a union of local isomorphism classes of tilings. If T is a
tiling satisfying a set of matching rules, then the tiling T ′ obtained from it by erasing
the markings is locally derivable from T , but the converse need not hold: they may be
in different MLD classes.
We say that a tiling has perfect matching rules if there exists a set of matching rules
such that all tilings that satisfy it are in the same local isomorphism class of tilings
under translations. That is, the allowed tilings with the markings added have perfect
local rules. If one tiling in an MLD class has perfect matching rules, then they all do,
see Theorem 11.2 of [2].
We can deﬁne analogous notions for Delone sets (under translations or under isome-
tries). A Delone set X2 is locally derivable under isometries (resp. translations) from a
Delone set X1 if there is an isometric copy X′
1 = QX1 + t (resp. translation X1 + t) and
a value R′ such for each x ∈X′
1 each 3R-neighborhood X2 ∩B(x, 3R) is determined
by the isometry equivalence class of the set X′
1 ∩B(x, R′). We say that X1 and X2 are
mutually locally derivable if each is locally derivable from the other (under isometries
or translations, respectively).
Finding generalized matching rules using vertex colorings is analogous to changing
the Delone set of ﬁnite type X (under translations) by replacing it with a new Delone
set X′ in which each point x of X is replaced with a particular ﬁnite local conﬁguration
of points Wi + x, where Wi is drawn from a ﬁnite list L′ of point conﬁgurations, each
of which includes 0, and all are inside the ball B(0, 1
4r), where X is an (r, R)-set. The
list L′ of conﬁgurations plays the role corresponding to the list of colors that might be
assigned to vertex x. In such a construction the resulting set X′ always satisﬁes
X ⊆X′.
(A.1)
In particular, we may choose each element of Wi to consist of n+2 points, which consist
of 0 and the vertices of a simplex enclosing 0, with no two of these simplices equivalent
9 Baake et al. [4] and G¨ahler et al. [22] also permit similarities T1 →λT1 in this deﬁnition. We exclude
similarities here.

under isometries. In this case we can recover X from X′ as the set of centers of 1
4r-stars
of X′ that are enclosing sets. Thus X is locally derivable from X′, but X′ may not be
locally derivable from X.
We can use the deﬁnitions above to deﬁne a notion of perfect matching rules for
Delone sets, as follows.
Deﬁnition A.1.
A Delone set X has perfect matching rules under isometries (resp. un-
der translations) if it is locally derivable under isometries (resp. under translations) from
a Delone set X′ which has perfect local rules under isometries (resp. under translations).
Nontrivial sets X which have perfect local rules (under translations) can be obtained
from translation tilings of Rn with a ﬁnite number of tiles that have “perfect matching
rules.” A different ﬁnite set of points is assigned to each prototile with the matching
conditions added, and X is the set of points that results from a tiling that obeys the
“perfect matching rules.” Such a conversion method is described in speciﬁc cases in
[32] and [22]. A general method for proving that certain tilings have “perfect matching
rules” is sketched in [20]. It is based on tile sets having an inﬂation–deﬂation rule having
the unique composition property, which appears in special cases in [1], see also [59].
In particular, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that Penrose tilings have “perfect
matching rules” under translations. A three-dimensional generalization appears in [10].
In a similar fashion tilings with perfect local rules under isometries can be converted
to Delone sets having perfect local rules under isometries. The most general result
demonstrating perfect local rules under isometries for tilings is that of Goodman-Straus
[24], which proves that perfect matching rules exist for nearly all substitution tilings,
i.e., perfect local rules after the matching conditions are added.
