Characteristics of Queueing Systems
• Key elements of queueing systems
• Customer: refers to anything that arrives at a facility and requires 
service, e.g., people, machines, trucks, emails, packets, frames.
• Server: refers to any resource that provides the requested service, 
e.g., repairpersons, machines, runways at airport, host, switch, 
router, disk drive, algorithm.

Calling Population
• Calling population: the population of potential customers, may 
be assumed to be finite or infinite.
• Finite population model: if arrival rate depends on the number of 
customers being served and waiting, e.g., model of one corporate 
jet, if it is being repaired, the repair arrival rate becomes zero.

number of customers being served and waiting, e.g., systems with 
large population of potential customers.

System Capacity
• System Capacity: a limit on the number of customers that 
may be in the waiting line or system.
• Limited capacity, e.g., an automatic car wash only has room for 10 
cars to wait in line to enter the mechanism.
• If system is full no customers are accepted anymore
If system is full no customers are accepted anymore
Server
Waiting line
• Unlimited capacity, e.g., concert ticket sales with no limit on the 
number of people allowed to wait to purchase tickets.

Arrival Process
• For infinite-population models: 
• In terms of interarrival times of successive customers.
• Arrival types:
• Random arrivals: interarrival times usually characterized by a 
probability distribution.
probability distribution.
• Most important model: Poisson arrival process (with rate λ), where 
a time represents the interarrival time between customer n-1 and 
customer n, and is exponentially distributed (with mean 1/λ).
p
y
(
)
• Scheduled arrivals: interarrival times can be constant or 
constant plus or minus a small random amount to represent 
early or late arrivals.
y
• Example: patients to a physician or scheduled airline flight arrivals 
to an airport
• At least one customer is assumed to always be present,
At least one customer is assumed to always be present, 
so the server is never idle, e.g., sufficient raw material for 
a machine.

system, e.g., machine-repair problem: a machine is “pending” 
when it is operating, it becomes “not pending” the instant it 
demands service from the repairman.

the queueing system until that customer’s next arrival to the

Queue Behavior and Queue Discipline
• Queue behavior: the actions of customers while in a 
queue waiting for service to begin, for example:
• Balk: leave when they see that the line is too long
• Renege: leave after being in the line when its moving too slowly
• Jockey: move from one line to a shorter line
• Jockey: move from one line to a shorter line
• Queue discipline: the logical ordering of customers in a
Queue discipline: the logical ordering of customers in a 
queue that determines which customer is chosen for 
service when a server becomes free, for example:
Fi
t i
fi
t
t (FIFO)
• First-in-first-out (FIFO)
• Last-in-first-out (LIFO)
• Service in random order (SIRO)
(
)
• Shortest processing time first (SPT)
• Service according to priority (PR)
8.11
Prof. Dr. Mesut Güneş ▪Ch. 8 Queueing Models

Service Times and Service Mechanism
• Service times of successive arrivals are denoted by S1, S2, S3.
• May be constant or random.
• {S1, S2, S3, …} is usually characterized as a sequence of independent 
and identically distributed (IID) random variables, e.g., 
• Exponential, Weibull, Gamma, Lognormal, and Truncated normal 
distribution.
• A queueing system consists of a number of service centers and
• A queueing system consists of a number of service centers and 
interconnected queues.
• Each service center consists of some number of servers (c) working 
in parallel upon getting to the head of the line a customer takes the
in parallel, upon getting to the head of the line, a customer takes the 
1st available server.
8.12
Prof. Dr. Mesut Güneş ▪Ch. 8 Queueing Models

Queuing System: Example 1
• Example: consider a discount warehouse where customers may
• serve themselves before paying at the cashier (service center 1) or 
• served by a clerk (service center 2)
8.13
Prof. Dr. Mesut Güneş ▪Ch. 8 Queueing Models

Queuing System: Example 1
• Wait for one of the three clerks:
• Batch service (a server serving several customers

simultaneously), or customer requires several servers 
simultaneously.

• Example: two workers who are responsible for 10 milling 
machines. 
• Machines run on the average for 20 minutes, then require an 
average 5-minute service period, both times exponentially 
distributed: λ = 1/20 and μ = 1/5.
• All of the performance measures depend on P0:

Networks of Queues
• No simple notation for networks of queues
• Two types of networks of queues
yp
q
• Open queueing network
• External arrivals and departures
b
f
• Number of customers in system varies over time
• Closed queueing network
• No external arrivals and departures
No external arrivals and departures
• Number of customers in system is constant

• The following results assume a stable system with infinite

calling population and no limit on system capacity:
• Provided that no customers are created or destroyed in the queue, 
then the departure rate out of a queue is the same as the arrival rate
into the queue, over the long run.
• If customers arrive to queue i at rate λi, and a fraction 0 ≤pij ≤1 of 
them are routed to queue j upon departure, then the arrival rate

• All customers must see the cashier at service center 3, the overall rate to

Summary 
•
Introduced basic concepts of queueing models.

Showed how simulation, and sometimes mathematical analysis, can be

used to estimate the performance measures of a system.
•
Commonly used performance measures: L, LQ, w, wQ, ρ, and λe.
•
When simulating any system that evolves over time, analyst must 
decide whether to study transient or steady-state behavior.
• Simple formulas exist for the steady-state behavior of some queues.
•
Simple models can be solved mathematically, and can be useful in 
p

providing a rough estimate of a performance measure.
