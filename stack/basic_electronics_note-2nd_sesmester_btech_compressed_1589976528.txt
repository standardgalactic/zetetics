MODULE-I 
Electronics 
Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, 
flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter.This distinguishes it from classical electrical 
engineering as it uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification rather than 
just using passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance.  
INTRODUCTION TO SIGNAL 
Electric signals (in electronics) – different voltages and currents in the electric network called electric “circuit” or 
“device”, which can be further described as the process of changes a certain physical quantity or state of a physical 
object over certain period of time. They are used for the purpose of visualization, registration and transmission 
of messages (information). Signal can be a carrier of different information e.g. electric, magnetic and acoustic 
signals and contains the information parameter e.g. amplitude, frequency or pulse width. In electronics, the most 
important signals are the changes in electric charge, current, voltage and electromagnetic field. They are used to 
analyze the behavior of electronic circuits or to measure the changing electrical values. 
What is Time Domain Analysis? 
A time domain analysis is an analysis of physical signals, mathematical functions, or time series of economic or 
environmental data, in reference to time. Also, in the time domain, the signal or function's value is understood for 
all real numbers at various separate instances in the case of discrete-time or the case of continuous-time. 
Furthermore, an oscilloscope is a tool commonly used to see real-world signals in the time domain. 
Moreover, a time-domain graph can show how a signal changes with time, whereas a frequency-domain graph 
will show how much of the signal lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies. 
In general, when an analysis uses a unit of time, such as seconds or one of its multiples (minutes or hours) as a 
unit of measurement, then it is in the time domain. However, whenever an analysis concerns the units like Hertz, 
then it is in the frequency domain. 
Frequency Domain 
In physics, electronics, control systems engineering, and statistics, the frequency domain refers to the analysis 
of mathematical functions or signals with respect to frequency, rather than time. Put simply, a time-domain graph 
shows how a signal changes over time, whereas a frequency-domain graph shows how much of the signal lies 
within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies. A frequency-domain representation can also 
include information on the phase shift that must be applied to each sinusoid in order to be able to recombine the 
frequency components to recover the original time signal. 
A given function or signal can be converted between the time and frequency domains with a pair of 
mathematical operators called transforms. An example is the Fourier transform, which converts a time function 
into a sum or integral of sine waves of different frequencies, each of which represents a frequency component. 
The "spectrum" of frequency components is the frequency-domain representation of the signal. The inverse 
Fourier transform converts the frequency-domain function back to the time function. A spectrum analyzer is a 
tool commonly used to visualize electronic signals in the frequency domain. 
How is Time Domain Analysis Different from Frequency Domain? 
Frequency domain is an analysis of signals or mathematical functions, in reference to frequency, instead of time. 
As stated earlier, a time-domain graph displays the changes in a signal over a span of time, and frequency domain 
displays how much of the signal exists within a given frequency band concerning a range of frequencies. Also, a 

 
5 
 
 
frequency-domain representation can include information on the phase shift that must be applied to each sinusoid 
to be able to recombine the frequency components to recover the original time signal. 
Furthermore, you can convert a designated signal or function between the frequency and time domains with a pair 
of operators called transforms. Moreover, a perfect example of a transform is the Fourier transform. Which 
converts a time function into an integral of sine-waves of various frequencies or sum, each of which symbolizes 
a frequency component. The so-called spectrum of frequency components is the frequency-domain depiction of 
the signal. However, as the name implies, the inverse Fourier transform converts the frequency-domain function 
back to the time function. 
Elementary signals:  
The elementary signals are used for analysis of systems. Such signals 
are,1. Step 2.Impulse  3. Ramp  4.Exponential  5.Sinusoidal

ANALOG SIGNAL 
An analog signal is a continuous wave denoted by a sine wave (pictured below) and may vary in signal strength 
(amplitude) or frequency (waves per unit time). The sine wave's amplitude value can be seen as the higher and 
lower points of the wave, while the frequency value is measured in the sine wave's physical length from left to 
right. 
There are many examples of analog signals around us. The sound from a human voice is analog, because sound 
waves are continuous, as is our own vision, because we see various shapes and colors in a continuous manner due 
to light waves. Even a typical kitchen clock having its hands moving continuously can be represented as an analog 
signal. 
 
 
DIGITAL SIGNAL: 
A digital signal is a signal that is being used to represent data as a sequence of discrete values; at any given time 
it can only take on one of a finite number of values. This contrasts with an analog signal, which 
represents continuous values; at any given time it represents a real number within a continuous range of values. 
Simple digital signals represent information in discrete bands of analog levels. All levels within a band of values 
represent the same information state. In most digital circuits, the signal can have two possible values; this is called 

 
7 
 
 
a binary signal or logic signal. They are represented by two voltage bands: one near a reference value 
(typically termed as ground or zero volts), and the other a value near the supply voltage. These correspond 
to the two values "zero" and "one" (or "false" and "true") of the Boolean domain, so at any given time a 
binary signal represents one binary digit (bit). 
 
 
Continuous And Discrete Signals 
Continuous-time signal: 
Continuous-time signal is the “function of continuous-time variable that has uncountable or infinite set of 
numbers in its sequence”.The continuous-time signal can be represented and defined at any instant of the time in 
its sequence. The continuous-time signal is also termed as analog signal. It is a continuous function of time 
defined on the real line (or axis) R. It has continuous amplitude and time. That is, the continuous-time signals 
will have certain value at any instant of time. 
The continuous-time signal is drawn as shown in Figure 1 Shown below. 
 
 

 
8 
 
 
The examples for continuous-time signals are sine waves, cosine waves, triangular waves, and so on. The 
electrical signals also behave as continuous-time signals when these are derived in proportion with the physical 
parameters such as pressure, temperature, sound, and so on. 
 
Discrete-time signal: 
 
Discrete-time signal is the “function of discrete-time variable that has countable or finite set of numbers in its 
sequence”. It is a digital representation of continuous-time signal.The discrete-time signal can be represented 
and defined at certain instants of time in its sequence. That is, the discrete-time signal is able to define only at 
the sampling instants. Digital signal can be obtained from the discrete-time signal by quantizing and encoding 
the sample values. The discrete-time signals are represented with binary bits and stored on the digital medium. 
The discrete-time signal is drawn as shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
The output data from a computer is one of the examples of discrete-time signals. 
 SAMPLING  
In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common 
example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal). 
A sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and/or space. 
                                           AMPLIFIER 
An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of 
a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from 
a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally 
greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by 
its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a power 
gain greater than one.  
An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. 
Amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic 
equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in different ways. One is by the frequency of the electronic signal being 
amplified. For example, audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20 kHz, RF 
amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20 kHz and 300 GHz, and servo amplifiers 
and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.

OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER 
An operational amplifier or op amp is a DC coupled voltage amplifier with a very high voltage gain. 
Op amp is basically a multistage amplifier in which a number of amplifier stages are interconnected to each 
other in a very complicated manner. Its internal circuit consists of many transistors, FETs and resistors. All this 
occupies a very little space. 
So, it is packed in a small package and is available in the Integrated Circuit (IC) form. The term Op Amp is 
used to denote an amplifier which can be configured to perform various operations like amplification, 
subtraction, differentiation, addition, integration etc. An example is the very popular IC 741. 
 
An operational amplifier, or op-amp, is a very high gain differential amplifier with high input impedance and low 
output impedance. Typical uses of the operational amplifier are to provide voltage amplitude changes (amplitude 
and polarity), oscillators,filter circuits, and many types of instrumentation circuits. An op-amp contains a number 
of differential amplifier stages to achieve a very high voltage gain. Figure given below shows a basic op-amp with 
two inputs and one output as would result using a differential amplifier input stage. We call the terminal, marked 
with negative (-) sign as the inverting terminal and the terminal marked with positive (+) sign as the non-inverting 
terminal of the operational amplifier. If we apply an input signal at the inverting terminal (-) than the amplified 
output signal is 180o out of phase concerning the applied input signal. If we apply an input signal to the non-
inverting terminal (+) then the output signal obtained will be in phase, i.e 
It will have no phase shift with respect to input signal. The op-amp also has two voltage supply terminals 
.
 
Single-Ended Input 
Single-ended input operation results when the input signal is connected to one input with the other input 
connected to ground. Figure below shows the signals connected. 
 
 
Double-Ended (Differential) Input 
In addition to using only one input, it is possible to apply signals at each input—this being a double-ended 
operation. Figure(a)  below shows an input, Vd, applied between the two input terminals (recall that neither 
input is at ground), with the resulting amplified output in phase with that applied between the plus and minus 
inputs. Figure(b) below shows the same action resulting when two separate signals are applied to the inputs, 
the difference signal being Vi1 - Vi2.

Ideal Op-Amp Characteristics 
An ideal op-amp should have the following characteristics: 
1. Infinite voltage gain (So that maximum output is obtained) 
2. Infinite input resistance (Due to this almost any source can drive it) 
3. Zero output resistance (So that there is no change in output due to change in load current) 
4. Infinite bandwidth 
5. Zero noise 
6. Zero power supply rejection ratio (PSSR = 0) 
7. Infinite common mode rejection ratio (CMMR = ∞) 
Practical Operational Amplifier 
None of the above-given parameters can be practically realized. A practical or real op-amp has some unavoidable 
imperfections and hence its characteristics differ from the ideal one. A real op-amp will have non-zero and non-
infinite parameters. 
 
Applications of Operational Amplifier 
The integrated op-amps offer all the advantages of ICs such as high reliability, small size, cheap, less power 
consumption. They are used in variety of applications such as inverting amplifier and non inverting amplifiers, 
unity gain buffer, summing amplifier, differentiator, integrator, adder, instrumentation amplifier, Wien bridge 
oscillator, Filters etc. 
Positiv Feedback ⇒ Oscillator 
Negative Feedback ⇒ Amplifier 
Working Principle of Op-Amp 
Open Loop Operation of an Operational Amplifier 
As said above an op-amp has a differential input and single ended output. So, if we apply two signals one at the 
inverting and another at the non-inverting terminal, an ideal op-amp will amplify the difference between the two 
applied input signals. We call this difference between two input signals as the differential input voltage. The 

 
12 
 
 
equation below gives the output of an operational amplifier.
Where, VOUT is the  
voltage at the output terminal of the op-amp. AOL is the open-loop gain for the given op-amp and is constant 
(ideally). For the IC 741 AOL is 2 x 105.V1 is the voltage at the non-inverting terminal. V2 is the voltage at the 
inverting terminal. (V1 – V2) is the differential input voltage. It is clear from the above equation that the output 
will be non-zero if and only if the differential input voltage is non-zero (V1 and V2 are not equal), and will be zero 
if both V1 and V2 are equal. Note that this is an ideal condition, practically there are small imbalances in the op-
amp. The open-loop gain of an op-amp is very high. Hence, an open loop operational amplifier amplifies a small 
applied differential input voltage to a huge value. Also, it is true that if we apply small differential input voltage, 
the operational amplifier amplifies it to a considerable value but this significant value at the output cannot go 
beyond the supply voltage of the op-amp. Hence it does not violate the law of conservation of energy. 
Closed Loop Operation 
The above-explained operation of the op-amp was for open-loop i.e. without a feedback. We introduce feedback 
in the closed loop configuration. This feedback path feeds the output signal to the input. Hence, at the inputs, 
two signals are simultaneously present. One of them is the original applied signal, and the other is the feedback 
signal. The equation below shows the output of a closed loop op-amp.
 
Where VOUT is the voltage at the output terminal of the op-amp. ACL is the closed loop gain. The feedback circuit 
connected to the op-amp determines the closed loop gain ACL. VD = (V1 – V2) is the differential input voltage. We 
say the feedback as positive if the feedback path feeds the signal from the output terminal back to the non-inverting 
(+) terminal. Positive feedback is used in oscillators. The feedback is negative if the feedback path feeds the part 
of the signal from the output terminal back to the inverting (-) terminal. We use negative feedback to the op-amps 
used as amplifiers. Each type of feedback, negative or positive has its advantages and disadvantages. 
DIFFERENTIAL AND COMMONMODE OPERATION 
One of the more important features of a differential circuit connection, as provided in an op-amp, is the 
circuit’s ability to greatly amplify signals that are opposite at the two inputs, while only slightly amplifying 
signals that are common to both inputs. An op-amp provides an output component that is due to the 
amplification of the difference of the signals applied to the plus and minus inputs and a component due to 
the signals common to both inputs. Since amplification of the opposite input signals is much greater than 
that of the common input signals, the circuit provides a common mode rejection as described by a numerical 
value called the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). 
Differential Inputs 
When separate inputs are applied to the op-amp, the resulting difference signal is the 
difference between the two inputs. 
(non inverting terminal –inverting terminal) 
Common Inputs 
When both input signals are the same, a common signal element due to the two inputs 
can be defined as the average of the sum of the two signals. 
 
Output Voltage 
Since any signals applied to an op-amp in general have both in-phase and out-ofphase 
components, the resulting output can be expressed as 
                                                           Vo =AdVd + AcVc  
where Vd = difference voltage 
Vc =common voltage 
Ad =differential gain of the amplifier 
Ac =common-mode gain of the amplifier

Ideal Voltage Transfer Curve: 
Ideal Voltage Transfer Curve – The ideal op-amp produces the output proportional to the difference between the 
two input voltages. The graphical representation of this statement gives the voltage transfer curve. It is the graph 
of 
output voltage 
vo  
against 
the 
input Voltage 
Vd 
 assuming 
gain constant. This 
graph 
is 
called transfer characteristics,of the op-amp. 
Now the output voltage is proportional to difference input voltage but only upto the positive and negative 
saturation are specified by the manufacturer  
 
 
 
Thus note that the op-amp output voltage gets saturated at +Vcc and –VEE and it can not produce output voltage 
more than + Vcc and vEE. Practically saturation voltages +Vsat, and – Vsat are slightly less than +Vcc and  –
VEE.Middle region is known as region of operation of OPAMP or linear region. 
Negative Feedback in Op Amp 
We obtain Negative feedback in an op amp by connecting output terminal of an op amp to its inverting input 
terminal through a suitable resistance as shown below. 
 
The gain of an op amp with negative feedback is called closed loop gain. 
The use of negative feedback can significantly improve the performance of an operational amplifier and any op-
amp circuit that does not use negative feedback is considered too unstable to be useful. But how can we use 
negative feedback to control an op-amp. Well consider the circuit below of a Non-inverting Operational Amplifier.

Virtual Ground Concept – OPAMP 
 
Using Infinite Voltage Gain 
We already know that an ideal opamp will provide infinite voltage gain. For real opamps also the gain will be 
very high such that we can consider it as infinite for calculation purposes. 
 
Gain = Vo/Vin 
As gain is infinite, Vin = 0 
 
Vin = V2 – V1 
In the above circuit V1 is connected to ground, so V1 = 0. Thus V2 also will be at ground potential. 
 
V2 = 0 
 
Why we need Virtual Ground ? 
Virtual Ground concept is very useful in analysis of an opamp when negative feedback is employed. It will simply 
a lot of calculations and derivations. 
 
Above concept is valid only when negative feedback is applied to opamp like in inverting ampliers. 
 

 
15 
 
 
Assumptions regarding OPAMP:(NEGATIVE FEEDBACK CLOSED LOOP OPAMP) 
1.Current drawn by either of input terminals of opamp or current entering  to opamp is zero 
as IDEAL OPAMP has infinite input impedance:I1 = I2 
2.Voltage difference between two input terminal is zero. 𝑉𝑑= 𝑉1−𝑉2 = 0 
 
Inverting Operational Amplifier | Inverting Op Amp 
 
 
We call the operational amplifier as an inverting operational amplifier or an inverting op-amp when the op-amp 
circuit produces the output which is out of phase with respect to its input by 180o. 
This means that if the input pulse is positive, then the output pulse will be negative and vice versa. The figure 
below shows an inverting operational amplifier built by using an op-amp and two resistors. Here we apply the 
input signal to the inverting terminal of the op-amp via the resistor Ri. We connect the non-inverting terminal to 
ground. Further, we provide the feedback necessary to stabilize the circuit, and hence to control the output, through 
a feedback resistor Rf. 
 
Mathematically the voltage gain offered by the circuit is given as 
 
Where,
 However, we know that an ideal op amp has infinite input impedance due to 
which the currents flowing into its input terminals are zero i.e. I1 = I2 = 0. Thus, Ii = If. Hence, 
 
We also know that in an ideal op amp the voltage at inverting and non-inverting inputs are always equal. 
As we have grounded the non inverting terminal, zero voltage appears at the non inverting terminal. That 
meansV2=0.Hence,V1 = 0, also. So, we can write 
 
From, above two equations, we get, 
 
The 
voltage 
gain 
of 
the 
inverting 
operational 
amplifier 
or 
inverting 
op 
amp 
is, 
 
This indicates that the voltage gain of the inverting amplifier is decided by the ratio of the feedback resistor to the 

 
16 
 
 
input resistor with the minus sign indicating the phase-reversal. Further, it is to be noted that the input impedance 
of the inverting amplifier is nothing but Ri. 
Inverting amplifiers exhibit excellent linear characteristics which make them ideal as DC amplifiers. Moreover, 
they are often used to convert input current to the output voltage in the form of Transresistance or Transimpedance 
Amplifiers. Further, these can also be used in audio mixers when used in the form of Summing Amplifiers. 
 
Non Inverting Operational Amplifier | Non Inverting Op Amp 
 
Non inverting amplifier is an op amp based amplifier with positive voltage gain. 
A non inverting operational amplifier or non inverting op amp uses op amp as main element. 
The op amp has two input terminals (pins). One is inverting denoted with minus sign (-), and other is non-inverting 
denoted with a positive sign (+). When we apply any signal to the non – inverting input of, it does not change its 
polarity when it gets amplified at the output terminal. So, in that case, the gain of the amplifier is always positive. 
 
 
Here, in the above circuit, we connect an external resistance R1 and feedback resistance Rf at inverting input. 
Now, by applying Kirchhoff Current Law, we get, 
 
Let us assume the input voltage applied to the non inverting terminal is vi. Now, if we assume that the op amp in 
the circuit is ideal op amp, then, 
 
Therefore, equation (i) can be rewritten as, 
 
 
The closed loop gain of the circuit is, 
 
This term does not contain any negative part. Hence, it proves that the input signal to the circuit gets amplified 
without changing its polarity at the output.From the expression of voltage gain of an non inverting op amp, it 
is clear that, the gain will be unity when Rf = 0 or R1 →infinite. 

 
17 
 
 
 
 
So, if we short circuit the feedback path and/or open the external resistance of the inverting pin, the gain of the 
circuit becomes 1. 
 
 
 
This circuit is called voltage follower or unity gain amplifier. This is used to isolate two cascaded circuits, because 
of its infinitely large impedance, at op amp inputs 
 
APPLICATION OF OPAMP: 
1. SUMMING AMPLIFIER 
Summing amplifier is basically an op amp circuit that can combine numbers of input signal to a single output that 
is the weighted sum of the applied inputs. This simple inverting amplifier can easily be modified to summing 
amplifier, if we connect several input terminals in parallel to the existing input terminals as shown below. 
 
Here, n numbers of input terminal are connected in parallel. Here, in the circuit, the non-inverting terminal of 
the op amp is grounded, hence potential at that terminal is zero. As the op amp is considered as ideal op amp, 

 
18 
 
 
the potential of the inverting terminal is also zero. So, the electric potential at node 1, is also zero. From the 
circuit, it is also clear that the current i is the sum of currents of input terminals. 
Therefore, 
 
Now, in the case of ideal op amp the current at the inverting and non-inverting terminal are zero. So, as per 
Kirchhoff Current Law, the entire input current passes through the feedback path of resistance Rf. That means, 
 
From, equation (i) and (ii), we get, 
 
This indicates that output voltage v0 is weighted sum of numbers of input voltages. 
2. DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER OR OP AMP SUBTRACTOR: 
Two signals can be subtracted, one from the other, in a number of ways. Figure given below 
shows two op-amp stages used to provide subtraction of input signals. The resulting 
output is given by: 
 
 
 
Another connection(both signals applied to single opamp) to provide subtraction of two signals is shown in Fig. 
given below This connection uses only one op-amp stage to provide subtracting two input signals. Using 
superposition the output can be shown.. 
 

 
19 
 
 
 
 
3. VOLTAGE BUFFER 
A voltage buffer circuit provides a means of isolating an input signal from a load by using a stage having unity 
voltage gain, with no phase or polarity inversion, and acting as an ideal circuit with very high input impedance 
and low output impedance. Figure given below shows an op-amp connected to provide this buffer amplifier 
operation. The output voltage is determined by 
                                                             Vo =V1 
 
4. OP AMP AS INTEGRATOR 
op amp integrator circuit can be done, if we replace the feedback resistor Rf  by a capacitor C as shown below. 
 
In an ideal op amp the voltage at non inverting input terminal is same as that of inverting input. 
Here, in the circuit, as the non inverting input is grounded, the electric potential of inverting input will also be 
zero as non inverting input. In an ideal op amp, no current entires to the op amp through both inverting and non 
inverting inputs. 
Now, if we apply Kirchhoff current law at node 1 of the above circuit, shown in figure , we get, 
 

 
20 
 
 
Integrating both side, we get, 
 
This is the integral function of input voltage. 
5. OP AMP DIFFERENTIATOR 
Differentiator is an op amp based circuit, whose output signal is proportional to differentiation of input signal.An 
op amp differentiator is basically an inverting amplifier with a capacitor of suitable value at its input terminal. 
The 
figure 
below 
shows 
the 
basic 
circuit 
diagram 
of 
an 
op 
amp 
differentiator. 
 
We will first assume that the op amp used here is an ideal op amp. We know that the voltage at both inverting and 
non inverting terminals of an ideal op amp is same. As the electric potential at non inverting terminal is zero since 
it is grounded. The electric potential of inverting terminal is also zero, as the opamp is ideal. Because, we know 
that the electric potential at non – inverting and inverting terminals. It is also known to us that the current entering 
through inverting and non inverting terminal of an ideal op amp is zero. 
Considering, these conditions of an ideal op amp, if we apply Kirchhoff Current Law at node 1 of the op amp 
differentiator circuit, we get, 
 
The above equation shows that the output voltage is the derivative of the input voltage.

2.INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE : 
The input offset voltage (VIO) is a parameter defining the differential DC voltage required between the 
inputs of an amplifier, especially an operational amplifier (op-amp), to make the output zero (for voltage 
amplifiers, 0 volts with respect to ground or between differential outputs. The manufacturer’s specification 
sheet provides a value of VIO for the op-amp. An ideal op-amp amplifies the differential input; if this input 
difference is 0 volts (i.e. both inputs are at the same voltage), the output should be zero. However, due to 
manufacturing process, the differential input transistors of real op-amps may not be exactly matched. This 
causes the output to be zero at a non-zero value of differential input, called the input offset voltage. To 
determine the effect of this input voltage on the output, consider the connection shown in figure given below: 
Using Vo = AVi, we can write: 
 
 
Equation shows how the output offset voltage results from a specified input  offset voltage for a typical 
amplifier connection of the op-amp.

4.INPUT OFFSET CURRENT: 
It is the algebraic difference between the currents into the noninverting and inverting terminals of OPAMP. 
 
5.OUTPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE DUE TO INPUT OFFSET CURRENT:IIO 
An output offset voltage will also result due to any difference in dc bias currents at both inputs. Since the 
two input transistors are never exactly matched, each will operate at a slightly different current. For typical 
op-amp connection, such as that shown in Fig., an output offset voltage can be determined as follows. 
Replacing the bias currents through the input resistors by the voltage drop that each develops, as shown in 
Fig., we can determine the expression for the resulting output voltage. Using superposition, the output 
voltage due to input bias current 𝐼𝐼𝐵

6. GAIN–BANDWIDTH 
 
Because of the internal compensation circuitry included in an op-amp, the voltage gain drops off as frequency 
increases. Op-amp specifications provide a description of the gain versus bandwidth. Figure given below 
provides a plot of gain versus frequency for a typical op-amp. At low frequency down to dc operation the 
gain is that value listed by the manufacturer’s specification AVD (voltage differential gain) and is typically a 
very large value. As the frequency of the input signal increases the open-loop gain drops off until it finally 
reaches the value of 1 (unity). The frequency at this gain value is specified by the manufacturer as the unity-
gain bandwidth, B1. While this value is a frequency (see Fig. )at which the gain becomes 1, it can be 
considered a bandwidth, since the frequency band from 0 Hz to the unity-gain frequency is also a bandwidth. 
One could therefore refer to the point at which the gain reduces to 1 as the unity-gain frequency ( f1) or unity-
gain bandwidth (B1). 

Another frequency of interest is that shown in Fig. at which the gain drops by 3 dB (or to 0.707 the dc 
gain, AVD), this being the cutoff frequency of the op-amp, fC. In fact, the unity-gain frequency and cutoff 
frequency are related by 
 
Equation  shows that the unity-gain frequency may also be called the gain–bandwidth product of the op-
amp.

Block Diagram Of Operational Amplifier (Op-amp)

The op-amp begins with a differential amplifier stage, which operates in the differential mode. Thus the inputs 
noted with ‘+’ &  ‘- ‘ .  
The positive sign is for the non-inverting input and negative is for the inverting input. The non-inverting input is 
the ac signal (or dc) applied to the differential amplifier which produces the same polarity of the signal at the 
output of  op-amp. The inverting signal input is the ac signal (or dc) applied to the differential amplifier. This 
produces a 180 degrees  out of phase signal at the output. 
The inverting and non-inverting inputs are provided to the input stage which is a dual input, balanced output 
differential amplifier. The voltage gain required for the amplifier is provided in this stage along with the input 
resistance for the op-amp. The output of the initial stage is given to the intermediate stage, which is driven by the 
output of the input stage. 
In this stage direct coupling is used, which makes the dc voltage at the output of the intermediate stage above 
ground potential. Therefore, the dc level at its output must be shifted down to 0Volts with respect to the ground. 
For this, the level shifting stage is used where usually an emitter follower with the constant current source is 
applied. The level shifted signal is then given to the output stage where a push-pull amplifier increases the output 
voltage swing of the signal and also increases the current supplying capability of the op-amp.

SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE: 
Definition of Semiconductor 
The materials that are neither conductor nor insulator with energy gap of about 1 eV (electron volt) are called 
semiconductors. 
Most common materials commercially used as semiconductors are germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) because of 
their property to withstand high temperature. That means there will be no significant change in energy gap with 
changing temperature.The relation between energy gap and absolute temperature for Si and Ge are given as, 
 
Where, T = absolute temperature in oK 
Assuming room temperature to be 300oK, 
 
At room temperature resistivity of semiconductor is in between insulators and conductors. Semiconductors show 
negative temperature coefficient of resistivity that means its resistance decreases with increase in temperature. 
Both Si and Ge are elements of IV group, i.e. both elements have four valence electrons. Both form the covalent 
bond with the neighboring atom. At absolute zero temperature both behave like an insulator, i.e. the valence band 
is full while conduction band is empty but as the temperature is raised more and more covalent bonds break and 
electrons are set free and jump to the conduction band. 
Intrinsic Semiconductors 
As per theory of semiconductor, semiconductor in its pure form is called as intrinsic semiconductor. In pure 
semiconductor number of electrons (n) is equal to number of holes (p) and thus conductivity is very low as 
valence electrons are covalent bonded. In this case we write n = p = ni, where ni is called the intrinsic 
concentration. It can be shown that ni can be written 
Where, n0 is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, VG is the semiconductor 
band gap voltage, and VT is the thermal voltage. 
The thermal voltage is related to the temperature by VT = kT/q 
Where, k is the Boltzmann constant (k = 1.381 × 10 − 23 J/K). 
 
Extrinsic Semiconductors 
As per theory of semiconductor, impure semiconductors are called extrinsic semiconductors. Extrinsic 
semiconductor is formed by adding a small amount of impurity. Depending on the type of impurity added we 
have two types of semiconductors: N-type and P-type semiconductors. In 100 million parts of semiconductor one 
part of impurity is added. 
 

 
27 
 
 
N type Semiconductor 
In this type of semiconductor majority carriers are electrons and minority carriers are holes. N – type 
semiconductor is formed by adding pentavalent (five valence electrons) impurity in pure semiconductor crystal, 
e.g. P. As, Sb. 
 
Four of the five valence electron of pentavalent impurity forms covalent bond with Si atom and the remaining 
electron is free to move anywhere within the crystal. Pentavalent impurity donates electron to Si that’s why N-
type impurity atoms are known as donor atoms. This enhances the conductivity of pure Si. Majority carriers are 
electrons . 
P type Semiconductors 
In this type of semiconductor majority carriers are holes, and minority carriers are electrons. The p-type 
semiconductor is formed by adding trivalent ( three valence electrons) impurity in a pure semiconductor crystal, 
e.g. B, Al Ba. 
 
Three of the four valence electron of tetravalent impurity forms covalent bonds with Si atoms. The phenomenon 
creates a space which we refer to a hole. When the temperature rises an electron from another covalent bond 
jumps to fill this space. Hence, a hole gets created behind. In this way conduction takes place. P-type impurity 
accepts electrons and is called acceptor atom. Majority carriers are holes. 
 

 
28 
 
 
 
SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE 
 
A diode is defined as a two-terminal electronic component that only conducts current in one direction (so long as 
it is operated within a specified voltage level). An ideal diode will have zero resistance in one direction, and 
infinite resistance in the reverse direction. 
Although in the real world, diodes can not achieve zero or infinite resistance. Instead, a diode will have negligible 
resistance in one direction (to allow current flow), and a very high resistance in the reverse direction (to prevent 
current flow). A diode is effectively like a valve for an electrical circuit. 
Semiconductor diodes are the most common type of diode. These diodes begin conducting electricity only if a 
certain threshold voltage is present in the forward direction (i.e. the “low resistance” direction). The diode is said 
to be “forward biased” when conducting current in this direction. When connected within a circuit in the reverse 
direction (i.e. the “high resistance” direction), the diode is said to be “reverse biased”. 
A diode only blocks current in the reverse direction (i.e. when it is reverse biased) while the reverse voltage is 
within a specified range. Above this range, the reverse barrier breaks. The voltage at which this breakdown occurs 
is called the “reverse breakdown voltage”. When the voltage of the circuit is higher than the reverse breakdown 
voltage, the diode is able to conduct electricity in the reverse direction (i.e. the “high resistance” direction). This 
is why in practice we say diodes have a high resistance in the reverse direction – not an infinite resistance. 
A PN junction is the simplest form of the semiconductor diode. In ideal conditions, this PN junction behaves as a 
short circuit when it is forward biased, and as an open circuit when it is in the reverse biased. The name diode is 
derived from “di–ode” which means a device that has two electrodes. Diodes are commonly used in many 
electronics projects and are included in many of the best Arduino starter kits. 
Diode Symbol 
The symbol of a diode is shown below. The arrowhead points in the direction of conventional current flow in the 
forward biased condition. That means the anode is connected to the p side and the cathode is connected to the n 
side. 
 

 
29 
 
 
We can create a simple PN junction diode by doping pentavalent or donor impurity in one portion and trivalent 
or acceptor impurity in other portion of silicon or germanium crystal block. These dopings make a PN junction at 
the middle part of the block. We can also form a PN junction by joining a p-type and n-type semiconductor 
together with a special fabrication technique. The terminal connected to the p-type is the anode. The terminal 
connected to the n-type side is the cathode. 
 
Working Principle of Diode 
A diode’s working principle depends on the interaction of n-type and p-type semiconductors. An n-type 
semiconductor has plenty of free electrons and a very few numbers of holes. In other words, we can say that the 
concentration of free electrons is high and that of holes is very low in an n-type semiconductor. Free electrons in 
the n-type semiconductor are referred as majority charge carriers, and holes in the n-type semiconductor are 
referred to as minority charge carriers. 
A p-type semiconductor has a high concentration of holes and a low concentration of free electrons. Holes in the 
p-type semiconductor are majority charge carriers, and free electrons in the p-type semiconductor are minority 
charge carriers. 
Unbiased Diode 
Now let us see what happens when one n-type region and one p-type region come in contact. Here due to 
concentration differences, majority carriers diffuse from one side to another. As the concentration of holes is high 
in the p-type region and it is low in the n-type region, the holes start diffusing from the p-type region to the n-type 
region.Again the concentration of free electrons is high in the n-type region and it is low in the p-type region and 
due to this reason, free electrons start diffusing from the n-type region to the p-type region. 
The free electrons diffusing into the p-type region from the n-type region would recombine with holes available 
there and create uncovered negative ions in the p-type region. In the same way, the holes diffusing into the n-type 
region from the p-type region would recombine with free electrons available there and create uncovered positive 
ions in the n-type region. 
In this way, there would a layer of negative ions in the p-type side and a layer of positive ions in the n-type region 
appear along the junction line of these two types of semiconductors. The layers of uncovered positive ions and 
uncovered negative ions form a region in the middle of the diode where no charge carrier exists since all the 
charge carriers get recombined here in this region. Due to the lack of charge carriers, this region is called the 
depletion region. 
 

 
30 
 
 
After the formation of the depletion region, there is no more diffusion of charge carriers from one side to another 
in the diode. This is due to the electric field appeared across the depletion region will prevent further migration of 
charge carriers from one side to another. 
The potential of the layer of uncovered positive ions in the n-type side would repeal the holes in the p-type side 
and the potential of the layer of uncovered negative ions in the p-type side would repeal the free electrons in the 
n-type side. That means a potential barrier is created across the junction to prevent further diffusion of charge 
carriers. 
Forward Biased Diode 
Now let us see what happens if a positive terminal of a source is connected to the p-type side and the negative 
terminal of the source is connected to the n-type side of the diode and if we increase the voltage of this source 
slowly from zero. 
In the beginning, there is no current flowing through the diode. This is because although there is an external 
electrical field applied across the diode, the majority charge carriers still do not get sufficient influence of the 
external field to cross the depletion region. As we told that the depletion region acts as a potential barrier against 
the majority charge carriers. 
This potential barrier is called forward potential barrier. The majority charge carriers start crossing the forward 
potential barrier only when the value of externally applied voltage across the junction is more than the potential 
of the forward barrier. For silicon diodes, the forward barrier potential is 0.7 volt and for germanium diodes, it is 
0.3 volt. 
When the externally applied forward voltage across the diode becomes more than the forward barrier potential, 
the free majority charge carriers start crossing the barrier and contribute the forward diode current. In that 
situation, the diode would behave as a short-circuited path and the forward current gets limited by only externally 
connected resistors to the diode. 
 
 
Reverse Biased Diode 
Now let us see what happens if we connect the negative terminal of the voltage source to the p-type side and 
positive terminal of the voltage source to the n-type side of the diode. At that condition, due to electrostatic 
attraction of the negative potential of the source, the holes in the p-type region would be shifted more away from 
the junction leaving more uncovered negative ions at the junction. 
In the same way, the free electrons in the n-type region would be shifted more away from the junction towards 
the positive terminal of the voltage source leaving more uncovered positive ions in the junction. As a result of this 

 
31 
 
 
phenomenon, the depletion region becomes wider. This condition of a diode is called the reverse biased condition. 
At that condition, no majority carriers cross the junction, and they instead move away from the junction. In this 
way, a diode blocks the flow of current when it is reverse biased. 
As we already told at the beginning of this article that there are always some free electrons in the p-type 
semiconductor and some holes in the n-type semiconductor. These opposite charge carriers in a semiconductor 
are called minority charge carriers. In the reverse biased condition, the holes find themselves in the n-type side 
would easily cross the reverse-biased depletion region as the field across the depletion region does not present 
rather it helps minority charge carriers to cross the depletion region. 
As a result, there is a tiny current flowing through the diode from positive to the negative side. The amplitude of 
this current is very small as the number of minority charge carriers in the diode is very small. This current is called 
reverse saturation current. 
If the reverse voltage across a diode gets increased beyond a safe value, due to higher electrostatic force and due 
to higher kinetic energy of minority charge carriers colliding with atoms, a number of covalent bonds get broken 
to contribute a huge number of free electron-hole pairs in the diode and the process is cumulative. 
The huge number of such generated charge carriers would contribute a huge reverse current in the diode. If this 
current is not limited by an external resistance connected to the diode circuit, the diode may permanently be 
destroyed. 
 
Operation of diode can be summarized in form of I-V diode characteristics graph.

V-I CHARACTERSTICS  OF DIODE: 
 
 
As reverse bias voltage is further raised, depletion region width increases and a point comes when junction breaks 
down. This results in large flow of current. Breakdown is the knee of diode characteristics curve. Junction 
breakdown takes place due to two phenomena.The diode current equation is also known as SHOCKLEY’S 
EQUATION. 
Avalanche Breakdown (for V > 5V) 
Under very high reverse bias voltage kinetic energy of minority carriers become so large that they knock out 
electrons from covalent bonds, which in turn knock more electrons and this cycle continues until and unless 
junction breakdowns. This is known as avalanche breakdown, a phenomenom that is cental to avalanche diodes. 
Zener Effect (for V < 5V) 
Under reverse bias voltage junction barrier tends to increase with increase in bias voltage. This results in very 
high static electric field at the junction. This static electric field breaks covalent bond and set minority carriers 
free which contributes to reverse current. Current increases abruptly and junction breaks down. This is known as 
Zener breakdown, and is a phenomenom that is cental to Zener diodes 
Static or DC Resistance 
It is the resistance offered by the diode to the flow of DC through it when we apply a DC voltage to it. 
Mathematically the static resistance is expressed as the ratio of DC voltage applied across the diode terminals to 
the DC flowing through it i.e. 
 
Dynamic or AC Resistance 
It is the resistance offered by the diode to the flow of AC through it when we connect it in a circuit which has an 
AC voltage source as an active circuit element. Mathematically the dynamic resistance is given as the ratio of 
change in voltage applied across the diode to the resulting change in the current flowing through it. This is 
shown by the slope-indicating red solid lines and is expressed as

ZENER DIODE 
 
Zener diode is basically like an ordinary PN junction diode but normally operated in reverse biased condition. But 
ordinary PN junction diode connected in reverse biased condition is not used as Zener diode practically. A Zener 
diode is a specially designed, highly doped PN junction diode. 

 
34 
 
 
Working Principle of Zener Diode: 
When a PN junction diode is reverse biased, the depletion layer becomes wider. If this reverse biased voltage 
across the diode is increased continually, the depletion layer becomes more and more wider. At the same time, 
there will be a constant reverse saturation current due to minority carriers. 
After certain reverse voltage across the junction, the minority carriers get sufficient kinetic energy due to the 
strong electric field. Free electrons with sufficient kinetic energy collide with stationary ions of the depletion layer 
and knock out more free electrons. These newly created free electrons also get sufficient kinetic energy due to the 
same electric field, and they create more free electrons by collision cumulatively. Due to this commutative 
phenomenon, very soon, huge free electrons get created in the depletion layer, and the entire diode will become 
conductive. This type of breakdown of the depletion layer is known as avalanche breakdown, but this breakdown 
is not quite sharp. There is another type of breakdown in depletion layer which is sharper compared to avalanche 
breakdown, and this is called Zener breakdown. When a PN junction is diode is highly doped, the concentration 
of impurity atoms will be high in the crystal. This higher concentration of impurity atoms causes the higher 
concentration of ions in the depletion layer hence for same applied reverse biased voltage, the width of the 
depletion layer becomes thinner than that in a normally doped diode. 
Due to this thinner depletion layer, voltage gradient or electric field strength across the depletion layer is quite 
high. If the reverse voltage is continued to increase, after a certain applied voltage, the electrons from the covalent 
bonds within the depletion region come out and make the depletion region conductive. This breakdown is called 
Zener breakdown. The voltage at which this breakdown occurs is called Zener voltage. If the applied reverse 
voltage across the diode is more than Zener voltage, the diode provides a conductive path to the current through 
it hence, there is no chance of further avalanche breakdown in it. Theoretically, Zener breakdown occurs at a 
lower voltage level then avalanche breakdown in a diode, especially doped for Zener breakdown. The Zener 
breakdown is much sharper than avalanche breakdown. The Zener voltage of the diode gets adjusted during 
manufacturing with the help of required and proper doping. When a zener diode is connected across a voltage 
source, and the source voltage is more than Zener voltage, the voltage across a Zener diode remain fixed 
irrespective of the source voltage. Although at that condition current through the diode can be of any value 
depending on the load connected with the diode. That is why we use a Zener diode mainly for controlling voltage 
in different circuits. 
The circuit symbol of a Zener diode is also shown below. 
 
Characteristics of a Zener Diode 
Now, discussing about the diode circuits we should look through the graphical representation of the operation of 
the 
zener 
diode. 
Normally, 
it 
is 
called 
the 
V-I 
characteristics 
of 
a 
Zener 
diode. 

 
35 
 
 
 
The above diagram shows the V-I characteristics of a zener diode. When the diode is connected in forward bias, 
this diode acts as a normal diode but when the reverse bias voltage is greater than zener voltage, a sharp breakdown 
takes place. In the V-I characteristics above Vz is the zener voltage. It is also the knee voltage because at this point 
the current increases very rapidly. 
Operation of Zener Diode Voltage Regulator 
A rectifier with an appropriate filter serves as a good source of d.c. output.  However, the major disadvantage of 
such a power supply is that the output voltage changes with the variations in the input voltage or load.  Thus, if 
the input voltage increases, the d.c. output voltage of the rectifier also increases. Similarly, if the load current 
increases, the output voltage falls due to the voltage drop in the rectifying element, filter chokes, transformer 
winding etc. In many electronic applications, it is desired that the output voltage should remain constant regardless 
of the variations in the input voltage or load. In order to ensure this, a voltage stabilising device, called voltage 
stabiliser is used. Several stabilising circuits have been designed but only zener diode as a voltage stabiliser. 
A zener diode can be used as a voltage regulator to provide a constant voltage from a source whose voltage may 
vary over sufficient range. The circuit arrangement is shown in Fig (i). The zener diode of zener voltage Vz is 
reverse connected across the load RL across which constant output is desired.  The series resistance R absorbs the 
output voltage fluctuations so as to maintain constant voltage across the load.  It may be noted that the zener will 
maintain a constant voltage Vz (= E0) across the load so long as the input voltage does not fall below Vz 
 
fig (i) 
 
 
Fig- (ii)
 

 
36 
 
 
When the circuit is properly designed, the load voltage E0 remains essentially constant (equal to Vz) even though 
the input voltage Ei and load resistance RL may vary over a wide range. 
(i)  Suppose the input voltage increases. Since the zener is in the breakdown region, the zener diode is equivalent 
to a battery VZ as shown in Fig (ii).  It is clear that output voltage remains constant at VZ (= E0). The excess 
voltage is dropped across the series resistance R. This will cause an increase in the value of total current I. The 
zener will conduct the increase of current in I while the load current remains constant. Hence, output voltage E0 
remains constant irrespective of the changes in the input voltage Ei. 
(ii)  Now suppose that input voltage is constant but the load resistance RL decreases. This will cause an increase 
in load current. The extra current cannot come from the source because drop in R (and hence source current I) will 
not change as the zener is within its regulating range. The additional load current will come from a decrease in 
zener current IZ. Consequently, the output voltage stays at constant value. 
Voltage drop across  R =   Ei − E0 
Current through R, I  =  IZ + IL 
Applying Ohm’s law, we have 
 
 
Light Emitting Diode (LED): 
 
A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a special type of PN junction diode. The light emitting diode is specially doped 
and made of a special type of semiconductor. This diode can emit light when it is in the forward biased state. 
Aluminum indium gallium phosphide (AlInGaP) and indium gallium nitride (InGaN) are two of the most 
commonly used semiconductors for LED technologies. 
Older LED technologies used gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), gallium phosphide (GaP), and aluminum 
gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). LEDs generate visible radiation by electroluminescence phenomenon when a low-
voltage direct current is applied to a suitably doped crystal containing a p-n junction, as shown in the diagram. 
The doping is typically carried out with elements from column III and V of the periodic table. When a forward 
biased current, IF, energizes the p-n junction, it emits light at a wavelength defined by the active region energy 
gap, Eg. 
When the forward biased current IF is applied through the p-n junction of the diode, minority carrier electrons are 
injected into the p-region and corresponding minority carrier electrons are injected into the n-region. Photon 
emission occurs due to electron-hole recombination in the p-region. 
Color of an LED 
The color of an LED device is expressed in terms of the dominant wavelength emitted, λd (in nm). AlInGaP LEDs 
produce the colors red (626 to 630 nm), red-orange (615 to 621 nm), orange (605 nm), and amber (590 to 592 
nm). InGaN LEDs produce the colors green (525 nm), blue green (498 to 505 nm), and blue (470 nm). The color 
and forward voltage of AlInGaP LEDs depend on the temperature of the LED p-n junction. 
"Liquid Crystal Display"- LCD: 
Stands for "Liquid Crystal Display." LCD is a flat panel display technology commonly used in TVs and 
computer monitors. It is also used in screens for mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. 

 
37 
 
 
LCD displays don't just look different than bulky CRT monitors, the way they operate is significantly different as 
well. Instead of firing electrons at a glass screen, an LCD has backlight that provides light to 
individual pixels arranged in a rectangular grid. Each pixel has a red, green, and blue RGB sub-pixel that can be 
turned on or off. When all of a pixel's sub-pixels are turned off, it appears black. When all the sub-pixels are 
turned on 100%, it appears white. By adjusting the individual levels of red, green, and blue light, millions of color 
combinations are possible. 
How an LCD works 
The backlight in liquid crystal display provides an even light source behind the screen. This light is polarized, 
meaning only half of the light shines through to the liquid crystal layer. The liquid crystals are made up of a part 
solid, part liquid substance that can be "twisted" by applying electrical voltage to them. They block the polarized 
light when they are off, but reflect red, green, or blue light when activated. 
Each LCD screen contains a matrix of pixels that display the image on the screen. Early LCDs had passive-
matrix screens, which controlled individual pixels by sending a charge to their row and column. Since a limited 
number of electrical charges could be sent each second, passive-matrix screens were known for appearing blurry 
when images moved quickly on the screen. Modern LCDs typically use active-matrix technology, which contain 
thin film transistors, or TFTs. These transistors include capacitors that enable individual pixels to "actively" retain 
their charge. Therefore, active-matrix LCDs are more efficient and appear more responsive than passive-matrix 
displays. 
NOTE: An LCD's backlight may either be a traditional bulb or LED light. An "LED display" is simply an LCD 
screen with an LED backlight. This is different than an OLED display, which lights up individual LEDs for each 
pixel. While the liquid crystals block most of an LCD's backlight when they are off, some of the light may still 
shine through (which might be noticeable in a dark room). Therefore OLEDs typically have darker black levels 
than LCDs. 
                                                                     RECTIFIER 
   DC Power Supply 
There are many types of power supply. Most are designed to convert high voltage AC mains electricity to a 
suitable low voltage supply for electronics circuits and other devices. A power supply can by broken down 
into a series of blocks, each of which performs a particular function. 
For example a 5V regulated supply: 
 
 
Transformer - steps down high voltage AC mains to low voltage AC. 
 
Rectifier - converts AC to DC, but the DC output is varying. 
 
Smoothing - smooths the DC from varying greatly to a small ripple. 
 
Regulator - eliminates ripple by setting DC output to a fixed voltage.

Transformer + Rectifier 
 
The varying DC output is suitable for lamps, heaters and standard motors. It is not suitable for electronic 
circuits unless they include a smoothing capacitor. 
Transformer + Rectifier + Smoothing + Regulator 
 
The regulated DC output is very smooth with no ripple. It is suitable for all electronic circuits. 
 
RECTIFIER 
In a large number of electronic circuits, we require DC voltage for operation. We can easily convert the AC voltage 
or AC current into DC voltage or DC current by using a device called P-N junction diode. 
One of the most important applications of a P-N junction diode is the rectification of Alternating Current 
(AC) into Direct Current (DC). A P-N junction diode allows electric current in only forward bias condition and 
blocks electric current in reverse bias condition. In simple words, a diode allows electric current in one direction. 
This unique property of the diode allows it to acts like a rectifier.

 HALF WAVE RECTIFIER 
A half wave rectifier is defined as a type of rectifier that only allows one half-cycle of an AC voltage waveform 
to pass, blocking the other half-cycle. Half-wave rectifiers are used to convert AC voltage to DC voltage, and only 
require a single diode to construct. 
A rectifier is a device that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). It is done by using a diode or 
a group of diodes. Half wave rectifiers use one diode, while a full wave rectifier uses multiple diodes. 
The working of a half wave rectifier takes advantage of the fact that diodes only allow current to flow in one 
direction. 
Half Wave Rectifier Theory 
A half wave rectifier is the simplest form of rectifier available. The diagram below illustrates the basic principle 
of a half-wave rectifier. When a standard AC waveform is passed through a half-wave rectifier, only half of the 
AC waveform remains. Half-wave rectifiers only allow one half-cycle (positive or negative half-cycle) of the AC 
voltage through and will block the other half-cycle on the DC side, as seen below. 
 
Only one diode is required to construct a half-wave rectifier. In essence, this is all that the half-wave rectifier is 
doing.Since DC systems are designed to have current flowing in a single direction, putting an AC waveform with 
positive and negative cycles through a DC device can have destructive (and dangerous) consequences. So we use 
half-wave rectifiers to convert the AC input power into DC output power. 
But the diode is only part of it – a complete half-wave rectifier circuit consists of 3 main parts: 
1. A transformer 
2. A resistive load 
3. A diode 
A half wave rectifier circuit diagram looks like this: 
 

 
40 
 
 
We’ll now go through the process of how a half-wave rectifier converts an AC voltage to a DC output. 
First, a high AC voltage is applied to the to the primary side of the step-down transformer and we will get a low 
voltage at the secondary winding which will be applied to the diode. 
 
During the positive half cycle of the AC voltage, the diode will be forward biased and the current flows through 
the diode. During the negative half cycle of the AC voltage, the diode will be reverse biased and the flow of 
current will be blocked. The final output voltage waveform on the secondary side (DC) is shown in figure 3 above. 
If we replace the secondary transformer coils with a source voltage, we can simplify the circuit diagram of the 
half-wave rectifier as: 
 
For the positive half cycle of the AC source voltage, the equivalent circuit effectively becomes: 
 
This is because the diode is forward biased, and is hence allowing current to pass through. So we have a closed 
circuit. 
 
 

 
41 
 
 
But for the negative half cycle of the AC source voltage, the equivalent circuit becomes: 
 
Because the diode is now in reverse bias mode, no current is able to pass through it. As such, we now have an 
open circuit. Since current can not flow through to the load during this time, the output voltage is equal to zero. 
This all happens very quickly – since an AC waveform will oscillate between positive and negative many times 
each second (depending on the frequency). 
Here’s what the half wave rectifier waveform looks like on the input side (Vin), and what it looks like on the output 
side (Vout) after rectification (i.e. conversion from AC to DC): 
 
The graph above actually shows a positive half wave rectifier. This is a half-wave rectifier which only allows the 
positive half-cycles through the diode, and blocks the negative half-cycle. 
The voltage waveform before and after a positive half wave rectifier is shown in figure 4 below. 
 

 
42 
 
 
Conversely, a negative half-wave rectifier will only allow negative half-cycles through the diode and will block 
the positive half-cycle. The only difference between a positive and negative half wave rectifier is the direction of 
current or voltage of the diode.As you can see in figure 5 below, the diode is now in the opposite direction. Hence 
the diode will now be forward biased only when the AC waveform is in its negative half cycle. 
 
Output frequency of rectifier is always equal to input frequency. 
 
 
 

 
43 
 
 
 
Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) is the maximum voltage that the diode can withstand during reverse bias condition. 
If a voltage is applied more than the PIV, the diode will be destroyed. 
 
FULL WAVE RECTIFIERS 
 
If rectifiers rectify both the positive and negative half cycles of an input alternating waveform, the rectifiers are 
referred as full wave rectifiers. Alternatively, we can say, a rectifier is a device that converts alternating current 
(AC) to direct current (DC). It does it by using a diode or a group of diodes.  
 
CENTER TAPPED FULL WAVE RECTIFIER 
The Center Tapped Full Wave Rectifier employs a transformer with the secondary winding AB tapped at the 
centre point C. It converts the AC input voltage into DC voltage The two diode D1, and D2 are connected in the 
circuit as shown in the circuit diagram below. 
 
Each diode uses one-half cycle of the input AC voltage. The diode D1 utilises the AC voltage appearing across the 
upper half (AC) of the secondary winding for rectification. The diode D2 uses the lower half (CB) of the secondary 
winding. 
 
 

 
44 
 
 
Operation of the Center Tapped Full Wave Rectifier 
When AC supply is switched ON the alternating voltage, Vin appears across the terminals AB of the secondary 
winding of the STEPDOWN transformer. During the positive half cycle of the secondary voltage, the end A 
becomes positive, and end B becomes negative. Thus, the diode D1 becomes forward biased, and 
diode D2 becomes reversed biased.STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER is used to convert high value of  AC 
voltage to lower AC values.The two diodes conduct simultaneously. Therefore, when the diode D1 conducts, the 
diode D2 does not conduct and vice versa. 
When the Diode D1 is conducting, the current (i) flows through the diode D1 load resistor RL (from M to L) and 
the upper half of the secondary winding as shown in the circuit diagram marked by the red colour arrow heads. 
During the negative half cycle, the end B becomes positive and end A becomes negative. This makes the diode 
D2 forward biased, and diode D1 reverse biased. 
When the diode D2 conducts while the diode D1 does not. The current (i) flows through the diode D2 load resistor 
RL (from M to L) and the lower half of the secondary winding as shown by the red dotted arrows. 
The current flowing through the load resistor RL is in the same direction (i.e., from M to L) during both the positive 
as well as the negative half cycle of the input. Hence, the DC output voltage (Vout = i RL) is obtained across the 
load resistor. 
FULL WAVE BRIDGE RECTIFIER 
In Full Wave Bridge Rectifier, an ordinary transformer is used in place of a center tapped transformer. The 
circuit forms a bridge connecting the four diodes D1, D2, D3, and D4. The circuit diagram of Full Wave Bridge 
Rectifier is shown below. STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER is used to convert high value of  AC voltage to 
lower AC values. 
 
 
  
The AC supply which is to be rectified is applied diagonally to the opposite ends of the bridge. Whereas, the load 
resistor RL is connected across the remaining two diagonals of the opposite ends of the bridge. 
 
 
 

 
45 
 
 
Operation of Full Wave Bridge Rectifier 
When an AC supply is switched ON, the alternating voltage Vin appears across the terminals AB of the secondary 
winding of the transformer which needs rectification. During the positive half cycle of the secondary voltage, the 
end A becomes positive, and end B becomes negative as shown in the figure below. 
 
The diodes D1 and D3 are forward biased and the diodes D2 and D4 is reversed biased. Therefore, diode D1 and 
D3 conduct and diode D2 and D4 does not conduct. The current (i) flows through diode D1, load resistor RL (from 
M to L), diode D3 and the transformer secondary. The waveform of the full wave bridge rectifier is shown above. 
 
During the negative half cycle, the end A becomes negative and end B positive as shown in the figure below. 
 
From the above diagram, it is seen that the diode D2 and D4 are under forward bias and the diodes D1 and D3 are 
reverse bias. Therefore, diode D2 and D4 conduct while diodes D1 and D3 does not conduct. Thus, current (i) flows 
through the diode D2, load resistor RL (from M to L), diode D4 and the transformer secondary. 
The current flows through the load resistor RL in the same direction (M to L) during both the half cycles. Hence, 
a DC output voltage Vout  is obtained across the load resistor.

Average value of Full wave rectifier 
 
In a full wave rectifier, the negative polarity of the wave will be converted to positive polarity. So the average 
value can be found by taking the average of one positive half cycle. 
Derivation for average current of a full wave rectifier, 
 
 
Average voltage equation for a full wave rectifier is VDC = 2Vm/π. 
So during calculations, the average voltage can be obtained by substituting the value of maximum voltage in the 
equation for VDC. 
RMS value of current for full wave rectifier:

Advantages of Full Wave Rectifiers 
 
Full wave rectifiers have higher rectifying efficiency than half-wave rectifiers. This means that they 
convert AC to DC more efficiently. 
 
They have low power loss because no voltage signal is wasted in the rectification process. 
 
The output voltage of centre-tapped full wave rectifier has lower ripples than a halfwave rectifiers. 
Disadvantages of Full Wave Rectifiers 
 
The centre-tapped rectifier is more expensive than half-wave rectifier and tends to occupy a lot of space. 
CAPACITOR-INPUT FILTER 
A half-wave rectifier with a capacitor-input filter is shown in Figure below. The filter is simply a capacitor 
connected from the rectifier output to ground. RL represents the equivalent resistance of a load. We will use the 
half-wave rectifier to illustrate the basic principle and then expand the concept to full-wave rectification.Both 
capacitor and load resistor are parallel. During the positive first quarter-cycle of the input, the diode is forward-
biased, allowing the capacitor to charge to within 0.7 V of the input peak, as illustrated in Figure (a). 
When the input begins to decrease below its peak, as shown in part (b), the capacitor retains its charge and the 
diode becomes reverse-biased because the cathode is more positive than the anode. During the remaining part of 
the cycle, the capacitor can discharge only 
through the load resistance at a rate determined by the RLC time constant, which is normally long compared to 
the period of the input. The larger the time constant, the less the capacitor will discharge. During the first quarter 
of the next cycle, as illustrated in part (c), the diode will again become forward-biased when the input voltage 
exceeds the capacitor voltage by approximately 0.7 V(Si)

Ripple Factor of Half Wave Rectifier 
‘Ripple’ is the unwanted AC component remaining when converting the AC voltage waveform into a DC 
waveform. Even though we try out best to remove all AC components, there is still some small amount left on the 
output side which pulsates the DC waveform. This undesirable AC component is called ‘ripple’. 
 
 
  

 
49 
 
 
To quantify how well the half-wave rectifier can convert the AC voltage into DC voltage, we use what is known 
as the ripple factor (represented by γ or r). The ripple factor is the ratio between the RMS value of the AC voltage 
(on the input side) and the DC voltage (on the output side) of the rectifier. 
The formula for ripple factor is: 
 
Which can also be rearranged to equal: 
 
The ripple factor of half wave rectifier is equal to 1.21 (i.e. γ = 1.21). 
Note that for us to construct a good rectifier, we want to keep the ripple factor as low as possible. This is why we 
use capacitors and inductors as filters to reduce the ripples in the circuit.

Vr = Vpeak(rectified at the output)/RfC

50 
 
 
 
Ripple Factor (γ) 
 
The output we will get from the rectifier will consist of both AC and DC components. The AC components are 
undesirable to us and will cause pulsations in the output. This unwanted AC components are called Ripple. The 
expression ripple factor is given above where Vrms is the RMS value of the AC component and Vdc is the DC 
component in the rectifier. 
For centre-tapped full-wave rectifier, we obtain γ = 0.48 
Note: For us to construct a good rectifier, we need to keep the ripple factor as minimum as possible. We can use 
capacitors or inductors to reduce the ripples in the circuit.

MODULE-II 
BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR 
 
W. Shockley, J. Barden and W. Bratterin invented the transistor in 1947.  The term ‘transistor’ 
is derived from the words ‘transfer’ and ‘resistor.’ These words describe the operation of a BJT 
which is the transfer of an input signal from a low resistance circuit to a high resistance circuit. 
The abbreviation BJT, from bipolar junction transistor, is often applied to this three terminal 
device. The term bipolar reflects the fact that holes and electrons participate in the injection 
process into the oppositely polarized material. If only one carrier is employed (electron or 
hole), it is considered a unipolar device. 
What is a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)? 
A bipolar junction transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that consists of two p-n 
junctions which are able to amplify or magnify a signal. It is a current controlled device. The 
three terminals of the BJT are the base, the collector and the emitter. A signal of small 
amplitude applied to the base is available in the amplified form at the collector of the transistor. 
This is the amplification provided by the BJT. Note that it does require an external source of 
DC power supply to carry out the amplification process. Bipolar transistors are manufactured 
in two types, PNP and NPN, and are available as separate components, usually in large 
quantities. The prime use or function of this type of transistor is to amplify current. This makes 
them useful as switches or amplifiers. They have a wide application in electronic devices like 
mobile phones, televisions, radio transmitters and industrial control.

ACTION OF TRANSISTOR 
 
 
 
Two batteries are used to simplify operation theory. Most applications require one 
voltage source. The negative terminal of the battery is connected to the N emitter. 
 
The positive terminal of the same battery is connected to the P-type base. Therefore, 
the emitter-base circuit is forward biased. 
 
In the collector circuit, the N collector is connected to the positive battery terminal. The 
P base is connected to the negative terminal. 
 
The collector-base circuit is reverse biased. 
 
Electrons enter the emitter from the negative battery source and flow toward the 
junction. The forward bias has reduced the potential barrier of the first junction. 
 
The electrons then combine with the hole carriers in the base to complete the emitter-
base circuit. However, the base is a very thin section, about 0.001 inches. 
 
Most of the electrons flow on through to the collector as the collector terminal is 
connected to positive terminal of battery and this reverse biased potential is very large 
so most of the majority charge carriers are attracted and will cross the large base to 
collector depletion region due to large reverse biased potential. 
 
there will be an injection of minority carriers(holes) from N dopped collector into the 
P-type base region material as the collector terminal is connected to positive terminal 
of battery.Similarly minority charge carriers(free electrons) in the base will move 
towards collector.Due to this a current will flow from collector terminal towards base 
due to the presence of minority charge carriers.So total collector current will be: 
 
             𝐼𝐶 =𝐼𝐶 majority + 𝐼𝐶𝑂 minority 

 
53 
 
 
 
 
 The minority-current component is called as: 
 leakage current and is given the symbol 𝐼𝐶𝑂  (𝐼𝐶 current with emitter terminal Open). 
 Approximately 95 to 98 percent of the current through the transistor is from an emitter 
to collector. About two to five percent of the current moves between emitter and base. 
 A small change in emitter to base bias voltage causes a somewhat larger change in 
emitter-collector current. This is what allows transistors to be used as amplifiers. The 
emitter-base current change, however, is quite small.

Input Characteristics of CB: 
 
For p-n-p transistor, the input current is the emitter current (𝐼𝐸) and the input 
voltage is the collector emitter voltage (𝑉𝐵𝐸). As the emitter – base junction is 
forward biased, therefore the graph of 𝐼𝐸 Vs 𝑉𝐵𝐸 is similar to the forward 
characteristics of a p-n diode. 𝐼𝐸 increases for fixed 𝑉𝐶𝐵 when 𝑉𝐵𝐸increases.  
 
 

 
56 
 
 
BASE WIDTH MODULATION/EARLY EFFECT: 
 
 
Due to increase in reverse biasing potential across C-B junction the Input characteristics graph is 
shifted towards Y-axis or 𝐼𝐸 increases.According to dopping base is lightly dopped as compared to 
collector. 
 
In N dopped collector majority charge carriers are free electrons,so free electrons will try to move 
to P dopped Base leaving immobile positive ions near the junction. 
 
As collector is heavily dopped and due to the presecnce of more free electrons, free electrons in 
collector  will try to fill these immobile positive ions. 
 
Due to this the width of depletion region across collector decreases and as the base is lightly dopped 
so the depletion region is shifted more towards the base and the effective width which is responsible 
for base current will decrease due to the increase in reverse biasing potential across C-B. 
 
As the effective width of  base will decrease then base current will also decrease. 
 
With the increase in reverse biasing potential the concentration gradient of charge carriers(holes)  in 
the effective width of base will increase and more charge carriers from emitter will try to move to 
this area and 𝐼𝐸 increases.This effect is known as BASE WIDTH MODULATION. 
Output Characteristics of CB: 
The output characteristics shows the relation between output voltage𝑉𝐶𝐵and output current. 𝐼𝐶 , here the emitter 
current 𝐼𝐸 is the input current which works as the parameter. CE mode has also three regions named (i) Active 
region, (ii) cut-off regions, (iii) saturation region.For cutoff region 𝐼𝐸=0 and 𝐼𝐶= 𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 in this region.

57 
 
 
 
Input Characteristics of CE: 
 
 
𝐼𝐵 (Base Current) is the input current, 𝑉𝐵𝐸 (Base – Emitter Voltage) is the input 
voltage for CE (Common Emitter) mode. So, the input characteristics for CE 
mode will be the relation between 𝐼𝐵 and 𝑉𝐵𝐸  with 𝑉𝐶𝐸  as parameter. The typical 

 
58 
 
 
CE input characteristics are similar to that of a forward biased of p-n diode. But 
as 𝑉𝐶𝐵  increases the base width decreases. 
Output Characteristics of CE: 
 
 
Output characteristics for CE mode is the curve or graph between collector 
current (𝐼𝐶) and collector – emitter voltage (𝑉𝐶𝐸) when the base current 𝐼𝐵 is the 
parameter. Like the output characteristics of common – base transistor CE mode 
has also three regions named (i) Active region, (ii) cut-off regions, (iii) saturation 
region. The active region has collector region reverse biased and the emitter 
junction forward biased. For cut-off region the emitter junction is slightly reverse 
biased and the collector current is not totally cut-off and𝐼𝐵=0 and 𝐼𝐶= 𝐼𝐶𝐸𝑂 in 
this region. And finally for saturation region both the collector and the emitter 
junction are forward biased.

Proper Zero Signal Collector Current 
In order to understand this, let us consider a NPN transistor circuit as shown in the figure 
below. The base-emitter junction is forward biased and the collector-emitter junction is 
reverse biased. When a signal is applied at the input, the base-emitter junction of the NPN 
transistor gets forward biased for positive half cycle of the input and hence it appears at the 
output. 
For negative half cycle, the same junction gets reverse biased and hence the circuit doesn’t 
conduct. This leads to unfaithful amplification as shown in the figure below. 
 
Let us now introduce a battery VBB in the base circuit. The magnitude of this voltage should 
be such that the base-emitter junction of the transistor should remain in forward biased, even 

 
60 
 
 
for negative half cycle of input signal. When no input signal is applied, a DC current flows in 
the circuit, due to VBB. This is known as zero signal collector current IC. 
During the positive half cycle of the input, the base-emitter junction is more forward biased 
and hence the collector current increases. During the negative half cycle of the input, the input 
junction is less forward biased and hence the collector current decreases. Hence both the 
cycles of the input appear in the output and hence faithful amplification results, as shown in 
the below figure. 
 
Hence for faithful amplification, proper zero signal collector current must flow. The value of 
zero signal collector current should be at least equal to the maximum collector current due to 
the signal alone. 
Proper Minimum VBE at any instant 
The minimum base to emitter voltage VBE should be greater than the cut-in voltage for the 
junction to be forward biased. The minimum voltage needed for a silicon transistor to conduct 
is 0.7v and for a germanium transistor to conduct is 0.5v. If the base-emitter voltage VBE is 
greater than this voltage, the potential barrier is overcome and hence the base current and 
collector currents increase sharply. 
Hence if VBE falls low for any part of the input signal, that part will be amplified to a lesser 
extent due to the resultant small collector current, which results in unfaithful amplification. 
Proper Minimum VCE at any instant 
To achieve a faithful amplification, the collector- emitter voltage VCE should not fall below the 
cut-in voltage, which is called as Knee Voltage. If VCE is lesser than the knee voltage, the 
collector base junction will not be properly reverse biased. Then the collector cannot attract 
the electrons which are emitted by the emitter and they will flow towards base which increases 
the base current. Thus the value of β falls. 
Therefore, if VCE  falls low for any part of the input signal, that part will be multiplied to a 
lesser extent, resulting in unfaithful amplification. So if VCE  is greater than VKNEE the 
collector-base junction is properly reverse biased and the value of β remains constant, 
resulting in faithful amplification. 

 
61 
 
 
TRANSISTOR BIASING, DC LOAD LINE,QUIESCENT POINT  
The proper flow of zero signal collector current and the maintenance of proper collector-
emitter voltage during the passage of signal is known as Transistor Biasing. The circuit 
which provides transistor biasing is called as Biasing Circuit. 
Need for DC biasing 
If a signal of very small voltage is given to the input of BJT, it cannot be amplified. Because, 
for a BJT, to amplify a signal, two conditions have to be met. 
 The input voltage should exceed cut-in voltage for the transistor to be ON. 
 The BJT should be in the active region, to be operated as an amplifier. 
If appropriate DC voltages and currents are given through BJT by external sources, so that 
BJT operates in active region and superimpose the AC signals to be amplified, then this 
problem can be avoided. The given DC voltage and currents are so chosen that the transistor 
remains in active region for entire input AC cycle. Hence  DC biasing is needed. 
Output Characteristics 
When the output characteristics of a transistor are considered, the curve looks as below for 
different input values. 
 
In the above figure, the output characteristics are drawn between collector current IC and 
collector voltage VCE for different values of base current IB. These are considered here for 
different input values to obtain different output curves. 
Operating point 
When a value for the maximum possible collector current is considered, that point will be 
present on the Y-axis, which is nothing but the saturation point. As well, when a value for 
the maximum possible collector emitter voltage is considered, that point will be present on 
the X-axis, which is the cutoff point. 

 
62 
 
 
When a line is drawn joining these two points, such a line can be called as Load line. This is 
called so as it symbolizes the output at the load. This line, when drawn over the output 
characteristic curve, makes contact at a point called as Operating point. 
This operating point is also called as quiescent point or simply Q-point. There can be many 
such intersecting points, but the Q-point is selected in such a way that irrespective of AC 
signal swing, the transistor remains in active region. This can be better understood through 
the figure below. 
 
The load line has to be drawn in order to obtain the Q-point. A transistor acts as a good 
amplifier when it is in active region and when it is made to operate at Q-point, faithful 
amplification is achieved. 
Faithful amplification is the process of obtaining complete portions of input signal by 
increasing the signal strength. This is done when AC signal is applied at its input.  
DC Load line 
When the transistor is given the bias and no signal is applied at its input, the load line drawn 
at such condition, can be understood as DC condition. Here there will be no amplification as 
the AC signal is absent. The circuit will be as shown below. 
 
The value of collector emitter voltage at any given time will be 
VCE=VCC−ICRC 

 
63 
 
 
As VCC and RC are fixed values, the above one is a first degree equation and hence will be a 
straight line on the output characteristics. This line is called as D.C. Load line. The figure 
below shows the DC load line. 
 
To obtain the load line, the two end points of the straight line are to be determined. 
Let those two points be A and B. 
To obtain A 
When collector emitter voltage VCE = 0, the collector current is maximum and is equal 
to VCC/RC. This gives the maximum value of VCE. This is shown as 
VCE=VCC−ICRC 
0=VCC−ICRC 
IC=VCC/RC 
This gives the point A (OA = VCC/RC) on collector current axis, shown in the above 
figure. 
To obtain B 
When the collector current IC = 0, then collector emitter voltage is maximum and will 
be equal to the VCC. This is shown as 
VCE=VCC−ICRC 
VCE =VCC 
(As IC = 0) 
This gives the point B, which means (OB = VCC) on the collector emitter voltage axis shown in the above 
figure. 
Hence we got both the saturation and cutoff point determined and learnt that the load line is a 
straight line. So, a DC load line can be drawn.

                            METHODS OF TRANSISTOR BIASING 
The biasing in transistor circuits is done by using two DC sources VBB and VCC. It is economical to minimize 
the DC source to one supply instead of two which also makes the circuit simple. 
The commonly used methods of transistor biasing are 
 
Base Resistor method 
 
Emitter stabilised biasing 
 
Biasing with Collector feedback resistor 
 
Voltage-divider bias 
All of these methods have the same basic principle of obtaining the required value of IB and IC from VCC in the 
zero signal conditions. 
Base Resistor Method 
In this method, a resistor RB of high resistance is connected in base, as the name implies. The required zero signal 
base current is provided by VCC which flows through RB. The base emitter junction is forward biased, as base is 
positive with respect to emitter. 
 
The required value of zero signal base current and hence the collector current (as IC = βIB) can be made to flow 
by selecting the proper value of base resistor RB. Hence the value of RB is to be known. The figure above shows 
how a base resistor method of biasing circuit looks like.  
 
Forward Bias of Base–Emitter 
Consider first the base–emitter circuit loop of Fig. Writing Kirchhoff’s voltage 
equation in the clockwise direction for the loop, we obtain 
 

 
65 
 
 
 
Let IC be the required zero signal collector current=β IB  
We know that VCC is a fixed known quantity and IB is chosen at some suitable value. As RB can be found 
directly, this method is called as fixed bias method. 
Applying KVL at collector to emitter junction or output side: 
 
 
 
Advantages 
 
The circuit is simple. 
 
Only one resistor RB is required. 
 
Biasing conditions are set easily. 
 
No loading effect as no resistor is present at base-emitter junction. 
Disadvantages 
 
The stabilization is poor as heat development can’t be stopped. 
 
The stability factor is very high. So, there are strong chances of thermal run away. 
Hence, this method is rarely employed.

Emitter stabilised biasing 
 
 
this biasing circuit is nothing but a fixed bias network with an additional emitter resistor, RE. Here, if IC rises due 
to an increase in temperature, then the IE also increases which further increases the voltage drop across RE. This 
results in the reduction of VC, causing a decrease in IB which in turn brings IC back to its normal value. Thus this 
kind of biasing network is seen to offer better stability when compared to fixed base bias network. However the 
presence of RE reduces the voltage gain of the amplifier as it results in unwanted AC feedback. In this circuit, the 
mathematical equations for different voltages and current are given as

ADVANTAGES OF VOLTAGE DIVIDER BIASING: 
  Operating point is almost independent of β variation. 
  Operating point stabilized against shift in temperature.

 
Biasing with Collector feedback resistor 
An improved level of stability can also be obtained by introducing a feedback path from collector to base as 
shown in Fig. below.Although the Q-point is not totally independent of beta (even under approximate 
conditions), the sensitivity to changes in beta or temperature variations is normally less than encountered for 
the fixed-bias or emitter-biased configurations. The analysis will again be performed by first analysing the 
base–emitter loop with the results applied to the collector–emitter loop

BJT TRANSISTOR MODELING 
The key to the small-signal approach is the use of ac equivalent circuits or models. Here are two 
models discussed. 
 
Re-MODEL 
 
 HYBRID-Π  MODEL 
 
A model is the combination of circuit elements, properly chosen, that best approximates the actual 
behavior of BJT under specific operating conditions, In summary the ac equivalent circuit of BJT 
amplifier is obtained by: 
1- Setting all dc sources to zero-potential equivalent and replacing them by a short circuit 
connection to ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                       Fig 5-1 Transistor circuit under examination

The re Transistor Model 
The re model employs a diode and controlled current source to duplicate the behavior of a transistor. A current-
controlled current Sources is one where the parameters of the current source are controlled by a current else 
where in the network, in general BJT transistor amplifiers are referred to as current-controlled device.

Fig 5-4(a) CB BJT transistor (b) re Model for the configuration of (a) 
. ac resistance of a diode can be determined by the equation rac=26mV / ID 
Same equation can be used to find the ac resistance of the diode of Fig5-4(a) if we simply substitute the emitter 
current as follows: 
 
 
e of re was chosen to emphasize that it is the dc level of emitter current that determines the ac level of the 
resistance of the diode of Fig 5-4(b). Substituting the resulting value of re in Fig 5- 4(b) will result in the very useful 
model of fig 5-5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5-5 CB re equivalent circuit 
 
 
For the CB, Zi range from a few ohms to a maximum of about 50 Ω 
 
If we set the signal to zero  (Vi=0) then 
Ie = 0A and Ic = αIe = α (0A) = 0A,Resulting in an open-circuit 
equivalence at the output terminals 
 
 For the CB configuration, values of Zo are in MΩ range for CB the input 
impedance is relatively small and the output impedance quite high

The Hybrid (h-parameter) Equivalent Model 
re model for the transistor is sensitive to the dc level of operation of the amplifier. For the hybrid equivalent model 
the parameters are defined at an operating point that may or may not reflect the actual operating conditions of 
the amplifier. 
For the basic three-terminal electronic device there are two ports (pairs of terminals) of interest. The set at the 
left will represent the input terminals, and the set at the right, the output terminals. 
 
  
Fig5-14 Two port system For each set of terminals, there are two 
variables of interest 
 
[5-8a] 
 
[5-8b] 
The parameters relating the four variables are called h-parameters from the word hybrid (V& I) 
 
Set Vo=0(short circuit the output terminals) and solve Eq[5-8a] for h11 
 
   =hi(Ω) short circuit input impedance parameter 
Set Ii equal to zero by opening the input, the following will result for h12 
=hr 
open circuit reverse transfer voltage ratio 
Eq[5-8b] Vo=0 by shorting the output terminals, will result for h21 
=hf 
short cct forward transfer current ratio 
Again opening the input leads by set Ii =0 and solving for h22 
=ho(S) open-circuit output admittance 
Since each term of Eq[5-8a] has the unit volt, let us apply KVL in reverse to find a circuit that fits the equation as in 
shown Fig5-15 

 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig5-15 Hybrid input equivalent circuit 
 
Since each term of Eq[5-16b] has the units of current, let us now apply KCL in reverse to obtain the 
circuit of Fig5-16 
Fig5-16 Hybrid output equivalent circuit. 
The complete ac equivalent circuit for the basic three-terminal linear device is indicated in Fig5-17 with a new 
set of subscripts for the h-parameters.

The circuit of Fig5-17 is applicable to any linear three-terminal electronic device or system with no 
internal independent sources.

The networks of Figs 5-18 & 5-19 are applicable for pnp or npn transistors. There are three different sets of h-
parameters (Table 5-1). 
 
Table5-2 lists typical parameter values in each of the three transistor configurations 
 
 
Approximate CE & CB hybrid equivalent circuit 
Since hre & hrb are normally small quantity, their removal is approximated by hre ~ 0 and hreVo = 0, resulting in a 
short-circuit equivalent for the feedback element as shown in Fig5-20 The resistance determined by 1/hoe & 1/hob 
are large enough to be ignored, in comparison to a parallel load, which can be replaced by an open circuit 
equivalent for the CE and CB models,

The resulting equivalent circuit (fig5-21) is quite similar to the general structure of the CB & CE

SUMMARY 
1- Amplification in the ac domain cannot be obtained without the application of dc biasing level. 
 
2- For most applications the BJT amplifier can be considered linear, permitting the use of the superposition theorem to separate the dc 
and ac analyses and designs. 
 
3- A model is the combination of circuit elements, carefully chosen, that best approximates the behavior of a BJT for a particular set of 
operating conditions. 
 
4- When introducing the ac model for a BJT: 
a. 
all dc sources are set to zero and replaced by a short circuit connection to ground. 
b. all capacitors are replaced by a short-circuit equivalent. 
c. all elements in parallel with an introduced short-circuit equivalent should be removed from the network. 
d. the network should be redrawn as often as possible. 
 
5- The input impedance of an ac network cannot be measured with an ohm-meter. 
 
6- The output impedance of an amplifier is measured with the applied signal set to zero. It cannot be measured with an ohmmeter. 
 
7- For all transistor amplifiers, the no-load gain is always greater than the loaded gain. 
 
8- The gain from source to load is always reduced by the internal resistance of the source 
 
9- The current gain of an amplifier is very sensitive to the input impedance of the amplifier and the applied load. 
 
10- The re model for a transistor is very sensitive to the dc biasing network of the amplifier. 
 
11- An output impedance for the re model can be included only if obtained from a data sheet or from a graphical measurement from 
the characteristic curves. 
 
12- For the common-base configuration, the input impedance is generally quite small and the output impedance quite large. In addition, 
the voltage gain can be quite large, but the current gain is always very close to 1. 
 
13- For the common-emitter configuration, the input impedance generally is approximately a few kilohms, and the output impedance is 
relatively large. In addition, the common-emitter configuration can a have a relatively high voltage and current gain. 

 
89 
 
 
14- The parameters of a hybrid equivalent model for a transistor are provided for a particular set of dc operating conditions. However, 
four parameters are provided rather than the two that normally appear for the re model. For some applications the reverse transfer voltage 
ratio and the typical output impedance normally found in the re model can be quite important.

6-BJT small signal Analysis 
1-Common-Emitter Fixed-Bias Configuration (CE) 
Input signal Vi is applied to the base of the transistor , recognized that the input current Ii is not the base current but the 
source current, while the output current Io is the collector current. 
The small-signal ac analysis begins by: 
1- Removing the dc effects of Vcc and replacing the dc blocking capacitors Cl and C2 by short- circuit equivalents, resulting in 
the network of Fig6-2. 
Note in Fig6-2 that the common ground of the dc supply and the emitter resistor permits the relocation of RB and RC in 
parallel with the input and output sections of the transistor

4- Emitter-Follower Configuration 
Since the output is taken from the emitter terminal of the transistor as shown in Fig6-16, the network is 
emitter-follower. The output voltage is always slightly less than the input signal due to the drop from base

relationship for the emitter-follower. The emitter-follower configuration used for impedance-matching 
purposes, it presents high impedance at the input and low impedance at the output

The network of fig6-20 equations changed only by replacing RB by R' = R1 ║R2 
 
Fig6-21 will also provide the input/output characteristics of an emitter-follower but includes a 
collector resistor RC. 
In this case RB is again replaced by the parallel combination of R1 and R2. The input impedance Zi 
and output impedance Zo are unaffected by RC since it is not ret1ected into the base or emitter 
equivalent. In fact, the only effect of RC will be to determine the Q-point of operation

DIGITAL ELECTRONIC PRINCIPLES: 
We know there are two types of signals, one is analog or continuous signal and the second one is Digital or discrete 
signal. So the science or field of research in the area of engineering is termed as Analog and Digital Electronics 
respectively. Now coming to the area of Digital Electronics, it is essential to understand wide range of applications 
from industrial electronics to the fields of communication, from micro embedded systems to military equipment. 
The main and perhaps the most revolutionary advantage of digital electronics is the decrease in size and the 
improvement in technology. 
Advantages of digital signal 
 
 
Carry more information per second than analogue signals 
 
Maintain quality over long distances better than analogue signals. 
 
They're automatic 
 
Easier to remove noise 
 
Can be very immune to noise 
Binary Digit and Logic Levels 
There are two digits in binary system. 0 and 1 called bits. Bit is contraction of two words Binary Digit.  
Digital Waveforms 
Digital waveform are voltages levels changing back and forth between HIGH and LOW levels or states.Usually 
these waveforms are represented as timing diagrams used to represent wave behavior relative to time, 
 
Figure 2 
Pulse indicated in Figure 2 has two edges: A leading edge where pulse goes to HIGH from LOW state and Falling 
edge where pulse revert. However it is non ideal pulse representation because sudden transition from one state to 
other is impractical. Depending on practical consideration it will take small amount of time to get HIGH transition 
from LOW and vice versa, 
 
 

 
123 
 
 
Rise Time: Time required for pulse to go from its LOW level to HIGH is called rise time tr. 
Fall Time: Time required for pulse to go from its HIGH level to LOW level is called fall time tf. 
Pulse Width: It is measure of duration between rise edge and fall edge of the pulse indicated as tw. 
Frequency ( f ) and Time Period T: 
Frequency of a periodic (which repeats itself) waveform is the rate at which it repeats itself and measured 
in Hz. Whereas time period is duration after that signal or waveform repeats itself. Mathematical interpretations 
are given below in equation (i) and (ii) . 
f = 1/T  Hz                       (i) 
 
T = 1/f  s                       (ii) 
Duty Cycles 
A more essential characteristic of a periodic signal that is ratio of pulse width to the time period. 
 
Duty Cycle = (Pulse-width / T) 100% 
1. Decimal Number System 
The number system that we use in our day-to-day life is the decimal number system. Decimal number system 
has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number system, the successive positions to the left of the 
decimal point represents units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. 
Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal number 1234 consists of 
the digit 4 in the units position, 3 in the tens position, 2 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands position, 
and its value can be written as 
2.

Binary to Decimal Conversion 
Conversion of Integer Numbers 
Just as you can convert any binary numbers to hexadecimal, or convert binary numbers to octal, any number in 
the binary number system can be converted into the hexadecimal number system. 
This conversion is also very simple method. Let, a binary number be (11010)2 , where the weight of the binary 
digits from most significant bit are 24, 23, 22, 21, 20 respectively. 

 
124 
 
 
Now the bits are multiplied with their weights, and the sum of those products is the respective decimal number. 
Now let us follow the following steps mathematically: 
 
Hence, (26)10 is the required decimal number. This is how binary to decimal conversion is performed. 
As another example, we convert the binary number (1110)2 to a decimal number: 
 
Convert Binary Number to Decimal Number 
Conversion of Decimal Point Number to Decimal 
This can also be done in the same way, however after the decimal point the number should be multiplied with 2-
1, 2-2 etc. 
For example, 
 
Decimal to Binary Conversion 
Integer Decimal Numbers to Binary 
Divide the number by 2 and take only the remainder, if division is completed than take only the remainder which 
gives the binary number. Suppose we are converting the decimal number (87)10. We divide 87 by 2 and get 43 as 
the quotient and 1 as the remainder. These remainders are written beside as shown below. 
 
The possibility of remainder (87)10 = (1010111)2 is only 1 and 0. Thus the number is counted from the last 
remainder. Such as 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 → 1 → 1 → 1. This is how decimal to binary conversion is done. 

 
125 
 
 
Fraction Decimal Numbers to Binary 
In this case, the successive multiplication is done. The number which is to be converted is multiplied with base or 
radix of binary number which is 2. The integer part or the carry of the product is taken out and the same process 
is repeated until we get an integer. For example-The binary equivalent of (.95)10 is evaluated as follows- 
 
Since, we are not getting the integer value after successive multiplication, we can approximate the value to be 
(.111110….)2. 
Negative Decimal to Binary 
In case of a negative number we can go for 2’s complement representation of a signed number. 
Example- 9 = 0000 1001 
1’s complement = 1111 0110. 
Adding 1 we get = 11110111 which is the 2’s complement representation of (-9). 
 
BINARY ARITHMETIC 
The arithmetic of binary numbers means the operation of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
Binary arithmetic operation starts from the least significant bit i.e. from the right most side.  
Binary Addition 
There are four steps in binary addition, they are written below 
 
0 + 0 = 0 
 
0 + 1 = 1 
 
1 + 0 = 1 
 
1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1 to the next significant bit) 
An example will help us to understand the addition process. Let us take two binary numbers 10001001 and 
10010101 

 
126 
 
 
 
The above example of binary arithmetic clearly explains the binary addition operation, the carried 1 is shown 
on the upper side of the operands. 
Binary Subtraction 
Here are too four simple steps to keep in memory 
 
0 – 0 = 0 
 
0 – 1 = 1, borrow 1 from the next more significant bit 
 
1 – 0 = 1 
 
1 – 1 = 0 
 
 
Suppose, A = 10101100 and B = 1010100 and we want to find out A – B. 
Now implementing the rules of binary subtraction 
 
The first step is 0 – 0 = 0 and that’s what is written in the place for result 
 
Similarly again the last step is repeated as here the numbers are both 0 and from the table we know 0 – 0 = 0. 
 
From the table we can find out that 1 – 1 = 0 and it is written 
 

 
127 
 
 
The table shows that 1 – 0 = 1 and we have written exactly that in result 
 
Here 0 – 1 = 1 with borrowing of 1 from the next significant bit and that’s what has been done. We will treat the 
next 1 as 0 in the next step as shown below. 
 
As the 1 was borrowed in the previous step we are treating the 1 as 0 and the result is 0 – 0 = 0 and that is 
written 
 
Again the last 1 has been borrowed because the operation done was 0 – 1 = 1 with borrow 1 from the next most 
significant bit and the final result of binary subtraction, we got is written in the place of result in the final step. 
Why We Do Need 2’s Complement? 
The main problem of using 2’s complement is that it can be used for subtraction for two binary digits. The 
computer understands only binary as we know, and there is nothing called as negative number in the binary 
number system but it is absolutely necessary to represent a negative number using binary which can be done by 
assigning a sign bit to the number which is an extra bit required. If the sign bit is 1 then number is considered 
negative and if it is 0, than it will be the number will be called as positive. 
For subtraction of binary numbers that can be done as follows- 
Subtracting a Smaller Number from a Larger Number 
1. Find 2’s complement of the smaller number. 
2. Add the larger and 2’s complement of the smaller number. 
3. Discard the carry. 
4. After discarding the carry, keep the result which will be answer for subtraction. 

 
128 
 
 
 
Subtracting Larger Number from Smaller Number 
1. Find 2’s complement of larger number. 
2. Add 2’s complement of larger number to the smaller number. 
3. If no carry is generated, find the 2’s complement of the result and the result will be negative. 
4. If carry is generated, discard the carry and take the result which will be the answer and the sign will be 
negative. 
 
Subtraction of larger number from smaller number. 
 
Binary Multiplication 
Like in case of binary addition and binary multiplication there are also four steps to be followed during a 
bigger multiplication or we can say these fundamental steps as well. 
These are 
 
 
Binary Division 
Binary division is an important but often overlooked part of binary arithmetic. Though it is not too difficult, it 
may look a bit tougher than the other binary operations because all the other had some similarity among 

 
129 
 
 
themselves like they all had four basic steps which made all the processes quite easy to understand. But the process 
of binary division does not have any specific rules to follow. 
 
LOGIC GATES AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 
 
Boolean algebra or switching algebra is a system of mathematical logic to perform different mathematical 
operations in binary system. These are only two elements 1 and 0 by which all the mathematical operations are to 
be performed. There only three basis binary operations, AND, OR and NOT by which all simple as well as 
complex binary mathematical operations are to be done. There are many rules in Boolean algebra by whichthose 
mathematical operations are done. In Boolean algebra, the variables are represented by English Capital Letter like 
A, B, C etc and the value of each variable can be either 1 or 0, nothing else. 
 
Some basic logical Boolean operations- 
AND operation, 
 
OR operation, 
 
Not operation, 
 
Some basic laws for Boolean Algebra, 
 
A . 0 = 0 where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A . 1 = A where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A . A = A where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A . Ā = 0 where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A + 0 = A where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A + 1 = 1 where A can be either 0 or 1. 
A + Ā = 1 
A + A = A 
A + B = B + A where A and B can be either 0 or 1. 

 
130 
 
 
A . B = B . A where A and B can be either 0 or 1. 
The laws of Boolean algebra are also true for more than two variables like,

These are another method of simplifying complex Boolean expression. In this method we only use three simple 
steps. 
1. Complement entire Boolean expression. 
2. Change all ORs to ANDs and all ANDs to ORs. 
3. Now, complement each of the variable and get final expression. 
By this method, 
will be first complemented, i.e.
.Now, change all (+) to (.) 
and (.) to (+) i.e.
Now, complement each of the variable,
This is the final 
simplified form of Boolean expression,
 
And it is exactly equal to the results which have been come by applying De Morgan Theorem.

LOGIC GATES: 
Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. It is an electronic circuit having one or more than 
one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic. 
Based on this, logic gates are named as AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate etc. Logic gates are primarily implemented 
using diodes or transistors acting 
as electronic 
switches. 
Logic 
circuits include 
such 
devices 
as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through 
complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. In modern practice, most gates are 
made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors). 
Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design 
because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.

BOOLEAN FUNCTION REPRESENTATION 
The use of switching devices like transistors give rise to a special case of the Boolean algebra called as switching 
algebra. In switching algebra, all the variables assume one of the two values which are 0 and 1.In Boolean algebra, 
0 is used to represent the ‘open’ state or ‘false’ state of logic gate. Similarly, 1 is used to represent the ‘closed’ 
state or ‘true’ state of logic gate. A Boolean expression is an expression which consists of variables, constants (0-
false and 1-true) and logical operators which results in true or false. A Boolean function is an algebraic form of 
Boolean expression. A Boolean function of n-variables is represented by f(x1, x2, x3….xn). By using Boolean 
laws and theorems, we can simplify the Boolean functions of digital circuits. A brief note of different ways of 
representing a Boolean function is shown below. 
 
Sum-of-Products (SOP) Form 
 
Product-of-sums (POS) form 
 
Canonical forms 
DOMAIN OF EXPRESSION:It is the set of variables present in that expression. 
Sum of Product (SOP) Form 
The sum-of-products (SOP) form is a method (or form) of simplifying the Boolean expressions of logic gates. In 
this SOP form of Boolean function representation, the variables are operated by AND (product) to form a product 
term and all these product terms are ORed (summed or added) together to get the final function. A sum-of-products 
form can be formed by adding (or summing) two or more product terms using a Boolean addition operation. Here 
the product terms are defined by using the AND operation and the sum term is defined by using OR operation. 
The sum-of-products form is also called as Disjunctive Normal Form as the product terms are ORed together and 
Disjunction operation is logical OR.  
STANDARD SOP:A  Standard SOP is the one in which all the variables in domain appear in each product term 
in expression.ex: A’BC + AB’C + ABC ‘ + ABC 
Non standard SOP: AB + ABC + CDE 

 
134 
 
 
SOP form representation is most suitable to use them in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). 
Examples 
AB + ABC + CDE 
A’BC + AB’C + ABC’ + ABC 
SOP form can be obtained by 
 
Writing an AND term for each input combination, which produces HIGH output. 
 
Writing the input variables if the value is 1, and write the complement of the variable if its value is 0. 
 
OR the AND terms to obtain the output function. 
Product of Sums (POS) Form 
The product of sums form is a method (or form) of simplifying the Boolean expressions of logic gates. In this 
POS form, all the variables are ORed, i.e. written as sums to form sum terms. All these sum terms are ANDed 
(multiplied) together to get the product-of-sum form. This form is exactly opposite to the SOP form. So this can 
also be said as “Dual of SOP form”. Here the sum terms are defined by using the OR operation and the product 
term is defined by using AND operation. When two or more sum terms are multiplied by a Boolean OR operation, 
the resultant output expression will be in the form of product-of-sums form or POS form. The product-of-sums 
form is also called as Conjunctive Normal Form as the sum terms are ANDed together and Conjunction operation 
is logical AND. Product-of-sums form is also called as Standard POS. 
Examples :(A+B)  (A + B + C)  (C +D)( NON Standard POS) 
 (A + B + C) (A + B + C ‘) (A + B’ + C) (A’ + B + C)( Standard POS)
