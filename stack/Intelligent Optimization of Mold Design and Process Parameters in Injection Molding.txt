Supervisor’s Foreword
Among different technologies in the manufacturing of plastic products, injection
molding is the most signiﬁcant technology which covers most of the industrial
applications. The main factors used to evaluate the quality of injected parts are part
design, material characteristics, mold design, and process parameters. Hence,
reliable design and optimization of injection molding process are essential.
Part design heavily depends on the customer requirements for which more than
17,000 plastic materials are used throughout the world; hence, part design and
material characteristics are not considered herein. Therefore, it is desirable to ﬁnd
the effect of mold design and process parameters on injection molding to improve
the quality of injected parts leading to the reduction of scrap rate.
Dr. Mehdi Moayyedian’s thesis was mainly dedicated to understanding the
interrelationship of process parameters, mold design, and fabricated plastic parts
integrity during injection molding. Such knowledge can be used as the basis of
ways to improve the quality of injected parts. He designed some new runner and
gate geometries of different dimensions and employed predictive tools to study the
defects formation during injection molding. The possibility of the formation of a
range of molding defects including warpage, weld line, and short shot along with
moldability index was studied. He further attempted to identify the most inﬂuential
process parameters and mold design geometries on the integrity of fabricated plastic
parts by using a combination of simulation modeling tools and methods namely
SolidWorks, SolidWorks Plastic, Taguchi method, ﬁnite element analysis (FEM),
fuzzy logic method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analytic hierarchy process
(AHP), Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS),
fuzzy AHP (FAHP), and fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS). A strength of his work is the
application of these tools and methods in the last two chapters to solve a
multi-objective problem to determine the higher and highest moldability index by
considering three different common defects and ﬁve different geometric and process
parameters of three different levels.

Dr. Moayyedian has demonstrated that he has gained signiﬁcant knowledge and
experience in applying these tools in this research and demonstrated very good
agreements between (ﬁnite element) modeling and experimental results which
validated the robustness of his assumptions, methodology, and algorithm.

Introduction
One of the challenges for most of the manufacturing industries is to produce the
most complicated parts. In overcoming these challenges, one of the appropriate
manufacturing methods is mold making which facilitates to produce more than 70%
of the parts (Tang et al. 2007). Injection molding which has been around more than
seven decades is one of the most signiﬁcant polymer processing operations in plastic
industry and approximately one-third of all plastics are converted into parts through
this process. It has helped producing plastic parts of complex-shapes and signiﬁcant
potential beneﬁts for the reduction of design and manufacturing lead times, good
dimensionality, and rapid design changes (Tang et al. 2007).
Khoshooee and Coates (1998), and Tsoi and Gao (1999) deﬁned injection mold-
ing process as the succession of three processes, namely polymer melt production,
injection, and solidiﬁcation. Firstly, the raw material is heated to its melting temper-
ature. Then, the melted polymer is injected into the cavity using high pressure via a
feeding system and ﬁnally, when ﬁlling of the cavity is nearly ﬁnished, the cavity is
kept at a constant pressure for the packing stage. Packing pressure is considered to
ﬁll the remaining volume of the cavity.
The literature review indicated that different factors evaluate the quality of injected
parts, but there are four main factors which affect the injection molding process,
namely Part design, mold design, material and process parameters. The individual
effect and the interaction of these factors lead to different defects in injection molding
process such as non-uniform shrinkage, warpage, sink mark, weld line, and short shot
etc. Since the design of the part is based on customer requirements, obviously not all
of which can be considered in part design. Hence part design is not considered in this
research. So is the material type because it is not possible to conduct experiments on
more than 17,000 plastic materials used throughout the world (Rosato and Rosato
2012).Theobjectiveofthisstudyistodeterminetheeffectofmolddesignandprocess

Background and Research Scope
methods of improving the quality and optimization of injection molding processes
have been considered. Although researchers have conducted considerable research to
determine the cause of different defects in injection molding, still there are unknown
causes of defects related to mold design and process parameters. Hence, developing
an effective framework to determine the right process and design parameters of
mold tools to minimize the scrap rate and improve the quality of the injected part is
necessary.
The purpose of this introductory chapter is:
• To describe the mold design in injection molding and highlight all necessary design
parameters of mold tools.
• To brieﬂy outline the signiﬁcant process parameters which affect the injection
process and then clarify the signiﬁcance of studying the process parameters in
injection molding.
• To describe the most common defects in injection molding related to mold design
and process parameters.
• To summarize the motivations that led to this research.
• To identify the research gap and scope of the research.
1.2
Mold Design
The ﬁrst and deﬁnitely most signiﬁcant factor in injection molding, after selecting
the appropriate material and product design, is the mold design to improve the man-
ufacturing process and minimize possible part defects. There are many mold design
parameters such as the type and shape of the gate and runner, sprue and all other
design features of mold tools. Normally, it is ideal to follow the standard rules in
mold design, but sometimes it may not be practical (Zhou 2013). Hence this part of
the research would concentrate on the most signiﬁcant mold tool parameters whose
poor evaluation leads to part defects.
1.2.1
Gate Types
The ﬁrst and probably most signiﬁcant part of the mold design is the gate type or
oriﬁce through which the molten plastic ﬂows and enters the mold cavity. Usually,
the designers design the gate thinner and signiﬁcantly narrower than the part to which
they connect as shown in Fig. 1.1. Packing factors, shrinkage, warpage, anisotropy,
and the stability of the part are affected by the gate type.
The position of the gate is another parameter affecting the material ﬂow, part
shrinkage, and the dimensional stability of the part. The wrong positioning of the
gate affects the ﬁber orientation which in turn causes defects such as warpage and
weld lines. If a part is end-gated, Fig. 1.2, then the ﬂow of the molten plastic along

Fig. 1.1 Simple schematic of gate, runner, and sprue (www.imoldmaking.com)
Fig. 1.2 Correct and incorrect position of the gate (Fischer 2003)
the gate is parallel to the long axis of the part leading to its uniform shrinkage, hence
reduction in the probability of warpage. While in side-gated part the ﬂow of the
molten plastic along the gate is perpendicular to the long axis of the part and leads
to different defects.
1.2.2
Runner
The purpose of having a runner is to contribute to bringing the molten plastic into
the cavities (Zhou 2013). The sprue connected to the nozzle of the injection machine
distributes the plastic into runners, gates and then cavities. The right dimensions
of the runner would cause the minimum ﬂow resistance leading to a reduction in

Background and Research Scope

pressure drop and mechanical stress of molten plastic. Different runners have differ-
ent applications and the most popular one is cold and hot runners. In cold runners,
the melt ﬂowing from sprue to the gate solidiﬁes while the melt is being solidiﬁed
in the cavity. In contrast, a hot runner (which utilizes heater band insulated from the
chilled cavities) maintains molten plastic for the next injection even after the plastic
is solidiﬁed in the cavity. Multi-cavity molds, having a uniform ﬁlling and holding
pressure in all cavities, require a balanced runner system and uniform gates. If the
runner system is made too large, it results in unnecessary long cycles and large mate-
rial losses. On the other hand, if the system is too small, the ﬁlling of the cavity would
not be complete and large amount of pressure is lost. In addition, if the diameter of
each runner is smaller than the maximum thickness of the part, the runner freezes
before the part does which leads to an excessive shrinkage.
1.2.3
Cooling System
In injection molding, the injected part must be cooled to facilitate the ejection. In
multi-cavities, all cavities must be cooled with the same coolant ﬂow rate, otherwise
the molded parts lose their accuracy. Rapid cooling leads to shortening the molding
cycle,whereasuniformcooling,aconsequenceofpreventionindifferentialshrinkage
and internal stresses, has better effect on product quality. Hence, cooling system is an
essential mold feature requiring special attention in mold design as shown in Fig. 1.3
(Zhou 2013).
1.3
Process Parameters in Injection Molding
An acceptable molding process is the completion of all steps without any defects,
namely ﬂash, sink mark, large dimension deviation, warpage, high residual stress,
unfavorable orientation, sticking in the mold, and poor mechanical properties

Fig. 1.4 Pressure decreases along the delivery system and the cavity (Zhou 2013)
(Zhou 2013). According to Zhou (2013) and Calhoun and Golmanavich (2002),
three main stages are considered in injection molding: ﬁlling, packing/holding, and
cooling. During the ﬁlling stage, the molten polymer ﬁlls the cavity to produce the
ﬁnal shape of the product. During the packing/holding stage, extra material is forced
into the cavity and the pressure is raised to compensate the effect of decreasing the
temperature and increasing the crystallinity development. During the cooling stage,
cooling down of the polymer to solidify the injected part properly is necessary so that
the product is stable enough for ejection. After cooling and ejecting the part from
the mold, the mold is closed again ready for the next injection.
In ﬁlling stage, the ﬁlling of the cavity starts from the beginning until when the
machine is switched to holding pressure. Controlling the velocity of the injection
process in ﬁlling stage is facilitated by the screw to force the material into the cavity
with a given velocity proﬁle. As shown in Fig. 1.4, the required injection pressure to
complete the ﬁlling stage is related to different factors such as material, mold design,
and process parameters.
There are different reasons to have higher injection pressure in some applications.
Firstly, when the wall thickness become thinner, it is much more difﬁcult to force
the plastic into the cavity which results from high velocity and high ﬂow resistance
of molten plastic through the cavity. Due to the fact that the cost of the material is
50–80% of the total cost, it makes sense to reduce the mass of the part as much as
possible (Zhou 2013). In addition, when the polymer becomes colder, the viscosity
becomes higher, causing difﬁculty in ﬁlling the cavity. It is easier for molten plastic
with higher temperature to ﬁll the cavity; however, it requires more time to cool

down. So, it is better to inject the material into the cavity with the lowest possible
temperature.
In packing/holding stage, after ﬁlling the cavity, the pressure is increased as shown
in Fig. 1.5. This stage includes both packing and holding phase. It includes the starting
or switchover point and the end point (the end of the holding pressure exerted by
the machine). The required time at this stage is affected by the material properties
and the cooling rate. During this stage, the material cools down and solidiﬁes but
the material ﬂow continues at the slower rate due to partial solidiﬁcation, associated
shrinkage and any loss of the material in that speciﬁc volume.
Finally, in cooling stage, cooling start from the ﬁrst stage of the injection, i.e.
ﬁlling, and continues until the ejection. Hence, the release of residual stresses affects
the shrinkage and warpage of the injected parts (Zhou 2013).
1.4
Common Plastic Defects in Injection Molding
Due to the complex interrelationship between the injected part and the mold tools, the
molding machine and process, it is really hard to recognize the origin of problems,
thus to take immediate action to rectify the situation. Consequently an instruction is
required to identify factors affecting the quality of injection molding parts like the
process, the machinery and the mold tools (Goodship 2004).
Molding defects are classiﬁed into different types the most signiﬁcant of which
being shrinkage and warpage, sink mark, streaks, weld line, jetting, record grooves
effect, incompletely ﬁlled parts, over sprayed parts (ﬂashes), Visible ejector marks,
and Entrapped air (blister formation) (Goodship 2004).

1.4 Common Plastic Defects in Injection Molding
7
1.4.1
Shrinkage and Warpage
The dimensional difference between the injected part and the cavity is called injec-
tion molding shrinkage (Pomerleau and Sanschagrin 2006). As the part dimensions
change and become smaller, its thickness reduces (Ozcelik et al. 2010). In injection
molding process, the production of parts with thin wall is challenging because the
molten plastic cannot easily ﬁll the mold cavity.
Non-uniform shrinkage and warpage is considered as the process of non-uniform
change of the geometrical dimensions of plastic products which leads to a distortion
of their original form (Yang et al. 2002).
The most signiﬁcant challenge in thin wall parts is to overcome warpage. It has
been acknowledged (Liao et al. 2004) that in determination of quality in injected
parts, the shrinkage and warpage are considered as main factors affecting quality of
the part. Similarly Yen et al. (2006) stated the signiﬁcance of shrinkage and warpage
and claimed that the reduction of cost and time at design stage is resulted from the
right simulation of shrinkage and warpage in injection molding process.
Ahmad et al. (2009), Fisher (2003), and Toe (2001) explained that warpage and
internal stress level are related to a number of factors such as variety of materials,
part and mold design, tooling and process parameters, and manufacturing process.
1.4.2
Short Shot
Molded parts with incompletely developed visual proﬁles are called incompletely
ﬁlled parts (short shots). This kind of defect often appears far from the gate when
ﬂow distances are long, or in thin walls (e.g. Ribs as shown in Fig. 1.6). Because of
insufﬁcient mold venting, this defect can also occur in other areas (Goodship 2004).
1.4.3
Sink Mark
Sink marks occur during the cooling process if the thermal contraction (shrink-
age) of the molten plastic cannot be compensated in certain areas. If the outside

Fig. 1.8 a Sink marks due to wall thickness variations and b sink marks on the cylindrical core
whose temperature was not controlled correctly (Goodship 2004)
walls of the molded part are not stable enough, due to insufﬁcient cooling, the
outmost layer of molten plastic is drawn inside by cooling stresses as shown in
Fig. 1.7 (Goodship 2004).
Three fundamental cases of sink mark are: slow solidiﬁcation, short holding pres-
sure time, and lack of holding pressure transfer. In order to have optimum holding
pressure transfer the gate cross section should be the largest. To avoid premature
solidiﬁcation of the sprue and gates they must be properly dimensioned. Sink marks
appear near material accumulation as depressions on the surface of the molded part
in the absence of a uniform shrinkage rate as shown in Fig. 1.8 (Goodship 2004).
1.5
Motivation for Research in Injection Molding
The objective of this study is to determine the effect of mold design and process
parameters in injection molding process to improve the quality of injected part by
evaluating different factors which leads to a number of defects. In injection molding,
due to the complexity of the process, different techniques are required to improve
the quality of injected part. Also when cold runners are used, reducing the scrap is
a signiﬁcant issue for related industries. Thus, the ﬁrst focus of this research is to
propose a new solution based on the evaluation of new features of mold design to
improve the quality of injected part and also to minimize the scrap rate of the process.
Due to the advancements in CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) technology,
simulation of the injection molding process is an inﬂuential tool to support engineers
and meet different challenges as a replacement for conventional method which is very

expensive and time consuming (Shen et al. 2007). Hence, the second focus of this
research is to furnish a method via CAE to evaluate the possibility of short shot defect.
Theevaluationofshortshotisverycomplicatedbecauseofanumberofgeometric and
process parameters. Although the literature review shows some research conducted
on short shot evaluation in injection molding, yet there is no research on how to
predict the short shot defects before it happens. So, CAE techniques and statistical
method such as Taguchi method, S/N (Signal to Noise) ratio, and ANOVA (Analysis
of Variance) are combined together herein, using a new deﬁnition of short shot
evaluation, to examine the impact of the parameters on this phenomenon.
In injection molding process, there are a number of processes and geometric
parameters also affect the moldability of the injected part. Hence, instead of opti-
mization of single-objective process, multi-objective process is used to determine the
moldability index. Although different tools and their combinations were applied to
determine the best moldability index such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy
AHP (FAHP), the technique for the order performance by its similarity to the ideal
solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS), there is no research on ﬁnding the
moldability indices closest to the best alternative. So another important focus of the
research is to study the optimization of multi-objective process in injection molding
using the combination of Taguchi method, FAHP and FTOPSIS to determine the
moldability indices closest to the best alternative. Applying the best alternative is
ideal for all industries but not always practical due to time, staff and material costs.
It should be noted that some better alternatives could be an acceptable substitute for
the best alternative. If the best alternative is not achievable, Taguchi method provides
other alternatives (associated with the highest moldability index) very close to the
best one.
1.6
Research Gap and Scope
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, designing new feature of mold design and
optimization of geometric and process parameters in injection molding offer many
advantages such as reducing the scrap of injected parts and increase the moldability of
injection process. In contrast, evaluating all parameters involved in injection molding
is complicated. Therefore, a solution is required.
Studies on how to deﬁne the new design features of mold tools in injection molding
are limited to three signiﬁcant limitations. First, the research on design features of
gate and runner has not investigated any new cross sectional shape of runner and
gate for scrap reduction and quality improvement. Second, detecting the short shot
as one of the common defects in injection molding has been investigated ignoring
the evaluation of the possibility of short shot happening through the process. Third,
in optimization of multi-objective process, evaluating the best moldability index has
been investigated but better alternatives are yet to be determined as a substitute for
the best one.

10
1
Background and Research Scope
Therefore, the goal of this research is to ﬁll the above research gaps by proposing
a new cross sectional shape of runner and gate to reduce the scrap and improve the
quality of injected parts, a new deﬁnition of short shot defect to predict its occurrence,
and also proposing a new methodology to increase the number of alternatives of
moldability index in injection molding. These are implemented as follows.
The new methodology for designing the new features of the mold is based on
the combination of advanced solution approaches such as simulation modelling with
Solid Woks Plastics and real case study (Chap. 3). Also, a new methodology is fur-
nished for gate modelling, combined with statistical tools and experimental method
(Chap. 4).
The methodology is expanded to determine the prediction of short shot occurrence
based on computer simulation modelling. Then statistical analysis tools are applied
to determine the most signiﬁcant parameters which affect the system performance
validated by a case study (Chap. 5).
An optimization approach is developed to determine the best alternative and better
alternatives with higher moldability index using Taguchi, FAHP and TOPSIS veriﬁed
via a case study (Chap. 6).
The nature and contents of the research implied veriﬁcation of different parts of
the work via individual case studies in Chaps. 3–6 rather than validation of the whole
achievements by one thorough case study.
1.7
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, from four main factors (material, part design, mold design and process
parameters) process parameters and mold design were selected as signiﬁcant factors
to be researched and the others were dismissed due to the above-mentioned reasons.
So the part design factor is not considered herein. Most of the common defects in
injection molding results from the runner and gate, and also process parameters the
most signiﬁcant of which are determined through the proposed methodology.
Due to the complexity of the injection molding process, the developed approach
is divided into ﬁve chapters: (Chap. 2) identifying the current research limitations
in mold design and process parameters; (Chap. 3) developing the new methodology
for cold runner; (Chap. 4) developing the new methodology for gate improvement;
(Chap. 5) proposing a new deﬁnition for short shot possibility; (Chap. 6) developing
a new methodology for the optimization of geometric and process parameters based
on the multi-objective process to determine the best and better moldability index.

Introduction
Injection molding is a signiﬁcant manufacturing process which represents more than
70% of production among the components of consumer products (Tang et al. 2007).
Consequently, in the last decade signiﬁcant attention has been paid to improve the
quality of products in injection molding industry. Four main factors, namely mold
design, part design, material; and process parameters, are signiﬁcant in injection
molding to improve the quality of injected parts out of which mold design and process
parameters lead to different defects.
Although signiﬁcant research effort evaluated the effect of mold design and pro-
cess parameters on the quality of injected parts, further studies are required to deter-
mine their degree of signiﬁcance. As highlighted in Chap. 1, the concepts of mold
design and process parameters have the potential to introduce signiﬁcant improve-
ments in injection molding technology. Based on this potential, the literature review
in this chapter is conducted on all approaches to produce quality parts in injection
molding technology, as well as the existing approaches which have evaluated the
effect of mold design and process parameters in injection molding. The overall pur-
poses of this chapter are as follows:
• To review the literature on injection molding process, common plastic defects,
mold design and process parameters in injection molding;
• To evaluate the limitations of conducted research on mold design and process
parameters;
• To determine the objectives of this research;
• To describe the research methodology to attain the research objectives.

Literature Review and Research Objectives
2.2
Injection Molding
Injection molding presents one of the most signiﬁcant processes in mass production
of plastic parts of complex geometry (Altan 2010). The bottleneck in mold industry
is the reduction of design time and manufacturing lead times, good dimensionality,
overall quality and rapid design changes. It is also considered that injection molding
is one of the most signiﬁcant polymer processing operations in plastic industry and
approximately one-third of all plastics are converted into injected parts. Good exam-
ples are injecting the products like computer monitor and mobile telephone cases,
with a thin shell feature.
Yin et al. (2011) state that Plastic Injection Molding (PIM) is an advanced tech-
nique to process plastic articles. It has been acknowledged by Subramanian et al.
(2005) and Zhang et al. (2009) that the application of injection molding process is
increasing signiﬁcantly in many industries like packaging, aerospace and aviation,
building and construction, automotive and electronic productions. Injection molding
process is probably the most commonly used methods for producing plastic parts.
According to Khoshooee and Coates (1998) and Urval et al. (2008), injection
molding is a key polymer processing technology capable of high-accuracy net shap-
ing of high added value products in mass production. Similarly, control of injection-
molded product quality is the ﬁrst priority for the industry. Injection molding is
deﬁned as non-steady multivariable processing of non-linear time dependent mate-
rials. Khoshooee and Coates (1998) and Tsoi and Gao (1999) deﬁned the injection
molding process as the succession of three processes, namely polymer melt produc-
tion, injection and solidiﬁcation as shown in Fig. 2.1.
Fig. 2.1 Injection molding process represented as two sub-processes (Khoshooee and Coates 1998)

2.2 Injection Molding
15
Fig. 2.2 Typical stages in an injection-molding cycle (Khoshooee and Coates 1998)
According to Khoshooee and Coates (1998), solid polymer granules are melted
and pumped by a rotating screw, in a temperature-controlled barrel, then injected
into the mold cavity where it solidiﬁes to form a product. The clamp closes, molten
polymer is injected into the cavity and pressure is required until the part has solidiﬁed
as shown in Fig. 2.2. The product stays inside the mold to cool during the time that
screw rotates and moves back to produce the melt for the next shot. At this stage, a
moderate pressure (screw-back pressure) is applied to the melt, causing the frictional
work done on the polymer and mixing of the melt. At the ﬁnal stage, the clamp
opens and the solid product is ejected from the cavity via ejector system. Closing
of the mold clamp makes the beginning of the next cycle. Huang and Tai (2001)
and Khoshooee and Coates (1998) described the procedure of injection molding in
different steps. Firstly, the raw material is heated to its melting temperature. Then,
under high pressure the melted polymer is injected into the cavity via sprue, runner
and gate. When ﬁlling of the cavity is nearly ﬁnished, the cavity is kept at a constant
pressure for the packing stage. Packing pressure is considered to ﬁll the remaining
volume of the cavity.
Also, Khoshooee and Coates (1998) and Ozcelik et al. (2010) stated that the qual-
ity of injected parts may be assessed by different factors like appearance, weight,
dimensional stability and mechanical properties. The product weight is the main
quality characteristic in injection molding process which affects the product dimen-
sional stability. The ﬂuctuation in shot weight and melt cushion are plastic defects
caused by melt inconsistency which signiﬁcantly change the product quality. For
instance, the variation in the cushion leads to a variation in the packing of the mold
and causing differences in residence time of polymer in the barrel from shot to shot.
Plastic injection molding (PIM) is one of the most signiﬁcant production methods.
In spite of the fact that many people consider this method as a simple and common
manufacturing process, PIM is one of the more complex processes due to many
accurate adjustments it requires (An and Chen 2008).
Wu and Huang (2007), Choi and Im (1999), Lo et al. (2009), and Bickerton
and Abdullah (2003) asserted that the injection molding process has three phases,
namely ﬁlling, packing and cooling phases. In the ﬁlling stage, the polymer melt is
injectedintothecavitythroughthesprue,runnerandgate.Inpackingstage,additional
polymer melt is pushed into the cavity to compensate for the shrinkage, resulting
from cooling of the material via cooling channels of the mold tools. During these

processes, because of the high pressure, temperature change, and the relaxation of
polymer chains, the residual stress is produced which result in shrinkage and warpage
of injected parts.
According to Liao and Hsieh (2004) due to competitive nature of 3C (computer,
communication device and consumer electronics) industries, demands for reducing
the research and development time, reduction in the size of the products, and better
accuracy in production are increasing every day.
2.3
Common Plastic Defects
Due to the complex interrelationship between the molded part and the mold tools,
the molding compound and the injection process, it is really hard to recognize the
origin of defects and thus to take immediate action to eliminate the defect. The guide
that follows aims to help with the practical work and to consider factors affecting the
quality of injection molding parts like the process, the machinery and the mold tools
is required (Goodship 2004). Molding defects are classiﬁed into different types the
most signiﬁcant of which are weld line, jetting, record grooves effect, incompletely
ﬁlled parts, Over sprayed parts (ﬂashes), Visible ejector marks, and Entrapped air
(blister formation). In order to eliminate these defects, good knowledge of the causes
of the defects is essential.
2.3.1
Weld Line
Weld lines are created when two or more melt ﬂows meet. The rounded ﬂow fronts
of the melt streams are ﬂattened and bonded when touching each other. If tempera-
ture and pressure are not high enough, the corners of the ﬂow fronts do not develop
entirely, and create a notch. Moreover, the ﬂow fronts no longer melt together consis-
tently, possibly producing an optical and mechanical weak spot as shown in Fig. 2.3.
If molding compounds containing additives (e.g., color pigments) are used, strong
orientations of these additives near the weld line are possible. This leads to color
changes near the weld line. Notches are particularly visible on dark or transparent
parts with smooth, highly polished surfaces. Color changes are particularly visible on
parts with metallic pigments. Signiﬁcant improvement is possible only when there is
a mold wall with high temperature. Increasing the mold wall temperature increases
the cycle time by approximately 2% per °C (Goodship 2004). The two main factors
which affect the strength of weld lines in an injected part are the part design and the
process parameters (Tosello et al. 2010; Wu and Liang 2005).

2.3.2
Incompletely Filled Parts
Injection molded parts with outer proﬁles which incompletely developed are called
incompletely ﬁlled parts (short shots). This kind of defect often appears far from
the gate if there are long ﬂow distances, or on thin walls (e.g. Ribs as shown in
Fig. 2.4). Because of insufﬁcient mold venting, this defect can also occur in other
areas (Goodship 2004).

the nominal proﬁle as shown in Fig. 2.5 (Goodship 2004).

Review of Literature on Signiﬁcant Factors in Injection
Molding
Injection molding is a process where melted polymer is injected into a mold cavity
or cavities, packed under speciﬁc pressure, and cooled until it has solidiﬁed as shown
in Fig. 2.6. During this process, there are three steps: ﬁrstly, heating the polymer in
the injection unit and ﬂow the molten polymer via pressure. Secondly, making the
polymer melt to ﬁll the cavity and solidify and ﬁnally, opening the mold to eject the
injected part.
The mechanical properties and performance of the injected part are important
factors which evaluate the quality of the part. Manufacture of a plastic part is
related to the part design and material choice in the early stages. Mold design,
manufacturing process, and then injection molding process come next. Injection
molding is not only shaping the material into the ﬁnal part but also includes the
Fig. 2.6 Injection molding process (Zhou 2013)

2.4 Review of Literature on Signiﬁcant Factors in Injection Molding

material properties affecting the performance of the product. In other words, it is
important to know the details of the manufacturing process and all factors which
affect the quality of injected products. These factors are polymer properties and its
performance during molding, product design and its characteristics, mold design
and its conﬁgurations, and process conditions (Zhou 2013).
2.4.1
Material
The signiﬁcant characteristic of plastics is related to their properties, namely low
density, wide range of mechanical properties, easy to process, low thermal/electrical
conductivity, high chemical resistance, and reusability. A wide variety of materi-
als, namely more than 17,000 plastic materials worldwide are available for injection
molding. Within the most common plastic families, there are ﬁve major thermoplas-
tic types that consist two-thirds of all thermoplastics, namely density polyethylene
(LDPE); polyvinyl chloride (PVC); high density polyethylene (HDPE); polypropy-
lene (PP); and polystyrene (PS) (Zhou 2013).
2.4.2
Part Design
In product design, the functional requirements along with moldability, productiv-
ity, and performance should be considered. Regardless of the material used, there
are certain basic design rules that should be observed in designing the part. Impor-
tant parameters in product design are described below in the following sub-section
(Harper 1999).
Wall Thickness
Figure 2.7 shows the relationship between part-wall thickness and mold shrinkage.
Increasing the wall thickness of a part has the same effect on shrinkage rate of the
part. In cooling stage, more time (slower cooling rate) is required and more stress
relaxation (stress reduction by having more relaxation of molten plastic) occurs.
If the material is semi-crystalline, then more crystals develop which also leads to
an increase in shrinkage. Also, if the wall of the part has different thicknesses, the
thickest wall would suffer from the most shrinkage and warpage (Fisher 2003).
Zhou (2013) maintains that in injection molding, uniform wall thickness is
strongly preferred. Thick sections near thin sections cool more slowly after the gates
are frozen. This leads to several defects in injection molding such as sink marks,
residual thermal stresses, warpage and variations in color or transparency. Thick-to-
thin wall transitions, if it is not possible to avoid, should be as gradual as possible
and not vary more than 3:1 in ratio as shown in Fig. 2.8. Hence, the minimum wall
thickness is required to reduce material cost and cooling time.

Literature Review and Research Objectives

Fig. 2.8 Effects of adjoining thick/thin wall sections (Zhou 2013)
Ribs
Ribs serve two main purposes, namely improve the melt ﬂow into sections like
corners, and increase ﬂexural stiffness of the part (Zhou 2013).
Consideration of ribs in part design enhances the rigidity of the part, but increases
the cost and in many cases causes warpage of the part. Changing the contours of the
cavity and ﬂow patterns as the plastic ﬁlls the cavity and variations in the thickness
of the injected part around the rib are two potential sources of ribbed-part plastic
defects (Fisher 2003).
Bosses and Cored Holes
Bosses are applied for mechanical fastener locations which provide cored holes
for pins and screws (Zhou 2013). Bosses like ribs cause problems. A boss with an
outside diameter two to three times the inside diameter is suitably strong for most
applications, but this may exceed the ratio of boss-wall thickness to the thickness
of the attached wall; this leads to high stresses. Because of the additional mass of
material at any juncture of boss-wall, direct connection of a boss to a wall must be
avoided. A better design separates the boss from the wall and ties it to the wall with
a relatively thin rib, as shown in Fig. 2.9 (Fisher 2003).

2.4.3
Mold Design
After designing the part and selection of appropriate material, the next step is the
mold design to facilitate the manufacturing process and minimize possible injection
molding defects. There are many parameters to determine for the mold design. Nor-
mally, it is better to follow the guide lines, but sometimes, it may be better if a guide
line is ignored and an alternative way is selected based on the expertise (Zhou 2013).
Hence, this section considers the most signiﬁcant parameters in designing the mold
tools, whose poor design leads to a number of defects for the injected parts.
Gate Types
The ﬁrst and probably most important parameter in mold design is the gate type or
oriﬁce through which the molten plastic ﬂows to ﬁll the mold cavity. Usually, the
designers consider the gate thinner and signiﬁcantly narrower than the part to which
it connects as shown in Fig. 2.10. Packing factors, shrinkage, warpage, anisotropy,
and the stability of the part are related to the gate type (Fisher 2003).
Runner
The main purpose of a runner is to transfer the molten plastic from sprue to all cavities
via the gate. There are different cross sectional shapes for runner each of which has
different applications (Pye 1989; Zhen-Yong et al. 2000) (Fig. 2.11). The designer

Fig. 2.11 Different cross sectional geometry of runner
should evaluate different factors for selecting the right cross-section of the runner
for a speciﬁc part. The most popular and most efﬁcient cross-section of a runner for
Two-plate mold tools is of round shape. For Three-plate mold tools, the trapezoidal
and modiﬁed trapezoidal are the best options if the runner is to be manufactured only
in one half of the mold, but still they are not acceptable due to the fact that the gate
cannot be positioned in line with the central ﬂow stream of the runner. Different cross-
sections of a runner have different effects on injection molding (Goodship 2004).
The purpose of having a runner is to facilitate the ﬂow of molten plastic into
the cavities. The sprue connected to the nozzle of the injection machine distributes
the melt into runners, gates and then individual cavities. The most popular runners
are cold and hot runners. In a cold runner, the melt ﬂowing from sprue to the gate

Fig. 2.12 Balance runner system for multi-cavities (www.imoldmaking.com)
solidiﬁes while the melt in the cavity is solidifying; but in a hot runner (which utilizes
heater band insulated from the chilled cavity or cavities), the runner maintains molten
plastic for the next injection even after the plastic is solidiﬁed in the cavity. Multi-
cavity molds, having a uniform ﬁlling and holding pressure in all cavities require
a balanced runner and uniform gates as shown in Fig. 2.12. Long runners result
in unnecessary long cycles and considerable material losses. On the other hand, if
runner size is too small, the cavity would not be completely ﬁlled and considerable
amount of pressure would be lost. In addition, if the runner diameter is smaller than
the maximum thickness of the part, the runner freezes before the part does. This leads
to an excessive shrinkage (Zhou 2013).
Cooling System
Having an optimum and efﬁcient design for cooling system enhances the cost-
efﬁciency of the process (Dimla et al. 2005). More than 70% of the injection process
time is related to cooling cycle (Pirc et al. 2009). In injection molding, the injected
part must be cooled to facilitate the ejection stage. In multi-cavities, all cavities must
be cooled with the same coolant ﬂow rate, otherwise the molded parts lose the dimen-
sional accuracy (Zhou 2013). Cooling may happen slowly by letting the heat dissipate
into the mold and then environment which is not suitable for large production. Rapid
cooling shortens the molding cycle followed by differential shrinkage and internal
stress, in contrast with the uniform cooling which results in better product quality
(Agazzi et al. 2010). Hence, cooling systems, namely parallel and serial as shown
in Fig. 2.13 are essential mold features requiring special attention in mold design
(Zhou 2013).
2.4.4
Process Parameters
According to Zhou (2013) and Calhoun and Golmanavich (2002), injection mold-
ing consist of three main stages: ﬁlling, packing/holding, and cooling as shown in
Fig. 2.14. During the ﬁlling stage, the hot polymer ﬁlls the cavity to produce the ﬁnal
shape of the product. During the packing/holding stage, extra material is forced into

the cavity and the pressure is raised to compensate the negative effect of decreasing
the temperature due to the cooling and also increasing the crystallinity development.
During the cooling stage the polymer solidiﬁes so that the product is stable and ready
enough for ejection after which the mold is closed again, ready for the next injection.
As shown in Fig. 2.15, the required injection pressure to complete the ﬁlling stage
is related to different factors namely material, mold design (sprue, runner and gate),
and process parameters.
There are different reasons to have higher injection pressure, namely it is much
more difﬁcult to force the plastic into the cavity of thinner wall which result from
high velocity and high ﬂow resistance of molten plastic, and higher viscosity through

Fig. 2.15 Pressure decreases along the delivery system and the cavity (Zhou 2013)
the cooling stage. In packing/holding stage, the pressure is increased based on the
material properties and cooling time. Finally, in cooling stage, the release of residual
stresses are the main reasons of shrinkage and warpage of the injected part (Zhou
2013). Hence, ﬁlling time, ﬁlling pressure, holding or packing time, packing pressure
and cooling time are process parameters which are related to different stages of
injection process.
2.5
Mold Design and Process Parameters and Their
Relation with Different Plastic Defects
2.5.1
Mold Design and Defects in Injection Molding
Mold design has an essential effect on the quality of the injected part. In mold
design, different factors should be considered. According to Dai et al. (2002), the
melted granules ﬁll the cavity through the gate. The gate type is one of the signiﬁcant
parameters in injection molding. The main purposes of the gates are to increase the
temperature (by increasing the velocity of molten plastic) and shear rate leading
to reduction of the melt viscosity; also to control its ﬂow rate, and to allow rapid
freezing of polymer at the end of the injection process which result from rapid cooling

Literature Review and Research Objectives

of the gate walls. In addition, the design of the gate affects the mechanical properties,
dimensional stability, and appearance of ﬁnal product.
It has been demonstrated by Viana and Cunha (2002) that after the injection
of a box shaped part, a central weld-line develops on its major surface due to the
wrong gating options, namely a hot runner with two pin point gates. So selection of
appropriate gates or runners is an essential in mold design.
Figure 2.16 demonstrates an improved pin-gate with two oriﬁces instead of one
in normal pin-gate sharing the same runner, that create a stable melt ﬂow and all
interaction between two streams of melt which can cause 10% improvement in tensile
strength and Young’s modulus (Dai et al. 2002).
Yen et al. (2006) maintained that there are a number of process parameters which
can affect the accuracy and the quality of plastic parts in injection molding process
such as ﬁlling speed, injection pressure, melt temperature, holding pressure, cooling
system and the selection of the injection gate. The main function of runner and gate is
to deliver the molten polymer into the cavity. Erosion of the runner which can entrap
the cavity by the molten polymer is the result of rapid rate of the ﬁlling. Hence, the
diameter and the length of the runner and gate, Fig. 2.17, are control parameters
which must be considered in determining the right size of runner and gate.
Xie et al. (2014) demonstrated that the undersized rectangular gate has many
adverse effects on the ﬁlling behavior and residual stress of molded part meaning
that larger gates lead to faster ﬁlling of the cavity and less residual stress.
Rutkauskas and Bargelis (2007) stated that the geometry and size of the gate
affects the quality of the injected part. Also, tuning the gate’s geometry optimally
minimizes the ﬂow-generated defects such as warpage and non-uniform shrinkage
in injection molding (Bikas et al. 2002).
According to Oroszlány and Kovács (2010) different gating does not affect part
deformation or shrinkage of injected part in manufacturing of implants from ther-
moplastic materials.
Gokey and Harris (2004) presented that the main purposes of the gate are (a) to
transfer the molten plastic into the cavities (b) to have a control over the melt ﬂow
both in ﬁlling and packing stages (c) to freeze the polymer at the end of injection
which leads to the withdrawal of the screw.

2.5 Mold Design and Process Parameters and Their Relation
27
Fig. 2.17 Runner and gate diameters (Yen et al. 2006)
Proper design of the runner and gate leads to an efﬁcacious injection molding
process with minimum plastic defects (Lee and Lin 2006), and, location of the weld
line can be determined by runner resizing (Zhai et al. 2006).
In thin wall technology one of the common defects is warpage (Huang and Tai
2001). It has resulted from the process parameters and gate dimension. The ﬁlling
rate which is related to gate dimension controls the ﬂow process in the cavity and
changes the average shrinkage of the parts in thin wall technology which leads to
changes in warpage rate.
According to Kima et al. (2003) plastic defects such as short shot happen in an
injected part which results from inappropriate selection of gate location. Appropriate
gate location leads to a better resin ﬂow and shorter time hesitancy. Finally, the
mechanical properties and dimensional stability of the injected part are improved as
well.
Dai et al. (2002) stated that the gate is a signiﬁcant design component which
should be as small as possible to avoid the excess material removal, and a visible
blemish on the injected part.

Process Parameters and Corresponding Defects
in Injection Molding
Injection molding process parameters like injection temperature, mold temperature,
and injection time determine the quality and cost of parts (Guoa et al. 2014; Zhao
et al. 2010). According to Erzurumlu and Ozcelik (2006), during the design and
manufacturing of thin shell thermoplastic parts, sink mark index according to the
process conditions is usually considered. The level of sink mark index is related to
injection molding process parameters. Ozcelik and Erzurumlu (2006) named sink
mark as depressions on the surface of molded parts. Although these depressions
are quite small, they are often visible due to light reﬂection from the part surface in
differentdirections.Oneofthereasonsofsinkindexinplasticproductsisthepresence
of rib that leads to shrinkage during the molding process. Similarly, Mathivanan
and Parthasarathy (2009) states that sink mark can be considered as an unwanted
depression or dimple on the surface of the plastic part, resulting from localized
shrinkage. The formation of sink marks in plastic products is due to the ﬂaws which
reduce the success of the injection molding technology (Shen et al. 2007). Also, it
has been established that in injection molding process, when the hot melt injects into
the cavity, a thin skin around the hot melt under the surface is formed, resulting from
contact with the cold mold wall.
Another common defect in injection molding process is weld line. According to
Li et al. (2007), when melt lines converged by two or more than two melts, weld
lines occur. Usually, weld lines result from the products with a through hole or multi
gates for injecting the materials (Mekhilef et al. 1995). Weld lines has effects on the
strength of the products and also appearance of the products. The tensile strength
and the impact strength of the products reduce when wild lines are existed in injected
part and the visible lines join on the external surface of the products. For most of
the injected products, weld lines are not acceptable. Hence, in product design, mold
design, and processing conditions setting, they are considered as the last factor in
terms of priority.
Li et al. (2007) states that when adjusting the location of gates for changing
the location of weld lines is not possible, a good solution is to adjust processing
parameters. Similarly, Deng et al. (2008) acknowledge that one of the most common
defects in injection molding process is weld lines. If the ﬂow fronts didn’t inter-
diffuse enough before they cooled, a line, notch, or color change occurs.
Weld lines decrease the strength and appearance quality of injected part. Different
process parameters such as melt temperature, injection speed, and injection pressure
and mold design parameters such as gate design lead to weld lines in an injected part
(Deng et al. 2008; Li et al. 2007). A number of reasons lead to weld lines such as
multiple injection gates, usage of inserts in the molding, the existence of holes, and
other part geometric characteristics which can split the melt ﬂow and then merge
again. The consequences of weld lines are considered in the following:

2.5 Mold Design and Process Parameters and Their Relation
29
• A plastic part is structurally weak at the location of weld lines, especially when
they are close to holes, causing reduction in lifetime of the part.
• Weld lines are not reasonable visually, causing an appearance issue.
Short shot is another common defect in injection molding. The formation of short
shot on the injected part is one of the defects which eliminate the overall success
of the injection molding process. There are different physical causes for incomplete
ﬁlling such as small shot volume, venting problems, insufﬁcient injection pressure,
low injection speed, wrong temperature control in mold and so on. The effects of
process parameters and geometric parameters on the formation of short shot on the
injected parts need to be understood in order to control the process parameters to
reduce the ﬂaw (Goodship 2004).
The reasons behind short shot are very complicated and numerous (Goodship
2004; Huang and Tai 2001; Oktem et al. 2007). In general, a short shot happens
when insufﬁcient material which was injected into the mold cannot ﬁll the cavity
properly (Kitayama et al. 2014). It is resulted from wrong plastic material selection,
incorrect processing parameters, incorrect mold design, and part design.
Hence, it is of critical signiﬁcance to successfully control the factors of inﬂuence
during the injection molding process, resulting from the complexity of melt ﬂow
process in mold cavity (Goodship 2004; Li et al. 2014).
2.5.3
Optimization Tools and Process Parameters in Injection
Molding
Taguchi method is the most common tool for improving the quality in injection
molding industry based on process parameters evaluation (Amer et al. 2013; Yang
et al. 2008). According to Tang et al. (2007) a mold which produces a thin plate
reduces the warpage problem by using Taguchi experimental design. According to
the number of factors and their levels in Table 2.1, L9 orthogonal array of Taguchi
is selected as shown in Table 2.2.
The Taguchi experimental design indicated that the optimum parameters which
minimize the warepage defect are melt temperature (240 °C), ﬁlling time (0.5 s),
packing pressure (90%) and packing time (0.6 s), and melt temperature is the most
signiﬁcant parameter.

Ahmad et al. (2009) claims that in analyzing the warpage defect, based on Taguchi
method and ANOVA, to optimize the processing parameters, the optimum level of
selected parameters are packing pressure at 375 MPa, mold temperature at 40 °C,
melt temperature at 200 °C and packing time at 1 s; and all process parameters turn
out to be signiﬁcant.
Taguchi optimization method is also used for optimization of surface quality for
decreasing surface roughness of mold tools of 7075-T6 aluminum material during
machining (Oktem et al. 2005). The process parameters are feed, cutting speed,
axial-radial depth of cut, and machining tolerance. Using Taguchi method, a regres-
sion analysis is considered to determine the ﬁtness of data based on full factorial
design. Taguchi orthogonal array, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) are considered to determine the optimal levels and the effects of
the process parameters on surface roughness. In the multiple regression analysis, R2
was 0.906 which shows that the roughness data measured from the experiments are
acceptableenoughtobuildtheotherpredictionregressionmodels.Theresultsofanal-
ysis of variance demonstrate the effect of process parameters on surface roughness,
namely 96.035% for machining tolerance, 2.512% for radial depth of cut, 1.537%
for axial depth of cuts, 0.177% for feed, and 0.092% for cutting speed shows the
effectiveness of Taguchi method.
It has been acknowledged by Wang and Fu (2008) that Taguchi method is useful
in biomedical application as well such as micro-needles used for biomedical appli-
cations like skin prick, blood collections, and drug delivery whose dimensions are
623 µm in length, 203 µm in width, and 106 µm in thickness. In order to achieve
optimal micro-needle quality, Taguchi method is used where the selected factors are
melt temperature (A), mold temperature (B), injection speed (C), and pressure hold-
ing speed (D). L9 orthogonal array based on Taguchi method was selected for three
experimental set of data. According to S/N ratio response-chart, Fig. 2.18, it is clear
that factor A has the biggest effect on quality; factor B is the next, followed by factor
C; i.e. factor D has the least impact on quality.

In conclusion, the optimal combination of factors is A1, B2, C1, D1 which are melt
temperature at 200 °C, mold temperature at 50 °C, injection speed at 150 mm/s, and
pressure holding speed at 5 mm/s.
According to Chen et al. (1997), in automobile industry, Chen et al. (1997), the
optimization of automobile bumper was considered to reduce silver streaks on the
surface of the product where a number of factors were chosen and the experiment
was conducted for L12 orthogonal array to identify the signiﬁcant factors. The result
demonstrates that the main factors which were related to the generation of silver
streaks are mold temperature, ﬁlling time, and the injection rate.
According to Kramschuster et al. (2006) the effect of process parameters on
shrinkage and warpage of a box-shaped part using conventional and micro-cellular
injection molding can be considered using two sets of fractional factorial design
of experiments, as a result of which three best combinations of parameter setting
leading to minimum shrinkage, warpage, predicted average shrinkage and warpage
are shown in Tables 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. According to this analysis supercritical
ﬂuid (SCF) content (nitrogen in this case in terms of SCF dosage time) and injection
speed were the most signiﬁcant factors affecting the shrinkage and warpage (SW)
of micro-cellular injection molded parts, whereas in conventional molding, the most
signiﬁcant factors were packing pressure and packing time.

Fig. 2.19 a The optimized warpage analysis result and b the ﬁnal product (Yin et al. 2011)
Yin et al. (2011) applied back propagation neural network on process parameters
mold temperature, melt temperature, packing pressure, packing time and cooling
time to minimize the warpage of a glove box cap using ﬁnite element simulations
along with Taguchi method.
It was proved that the prediction system of the Neural Network has the ability
to calculate the warpage of the plastic part within an error range of 2%. The ﬁnal
part is shown in Fig. 2.19. Similarly, in surface quality, it was established by Liu
and Chang (2000) that Taguchi method is an appropriate tool to optimize the surface
quality of gas assisted injection molded composites where unacceptable mold design
and process parameters lead to increase of the surface roughness. Table 2.5 shows
different parameters used in optimization of surface quality via Taguchi method using
an L18 orthogonal array as a result of which melt temperature and the gas injection
delay time turned out to be the signiﬁcant parameters.
Oktem et al. (2007) and Huang and Tai (2001) applied Taguchi method to a thin
shell part to ﬁnd the optimum level of process parameters. They demonstrated that
Taguchi method is feasible enough to solve the warpage and shrinkage problem.
Taguchi robust design method was also considered as a successful tool in ﬁnding the
optimal process control for the fabrication of thin walled parts (Urval et al. 2008;
Yousef et al. 2013).

In the past few decades, researchers have employed various methods of optimiza-
tion in injection molding for reducing defect rates. Neural network was employed and
lead to signiﬁcant reduction in warpage and shrinkage rate (Lotti et al. 2002; Yen et al.
2006; Yin et al. 2011). Shrinkage optimization plays the main role in determining
the ﬁnal dimension of injected parts where Taguchi identiﬁes the best level of each
process parameters for minimum non-uniform shrinkage (Modraka and Mandulakb
2013; Pomerleau and Sanschagrin 2006; Toe 2001). For reducing the shrinkage
and warpage in thin wall product, experimental design of Taguchi determines the
optimum set of signiﬁcant parameters (Huang and Tai 2001; Liao et al. 2004).
Neural networks avoids any shortcoming in the application of conventional meth-
ods such as trial-and-error (Chen et al. 2008; Dang 2013). The combination of sta-
tistical tools such as ANOVA and Taguchi and numerical modelling with neural
network determines the optimal parameter settings (Chen et al. 2014; Cheng et al.
2012; Jui-Ming and Wang 2002).
Two other methods used to determine the signiﬁcant parameters are Fuzzy logic
method and technique for order performance by its similarity to ideal solution
(TOPSIS) method. TOPSIS was initially developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981)
which uses both quantitative and qualitative factors (Ekmekçio˘glu et al. 2010).
When the information is uncertain TOPSIS is combined with fuzzy logic called
(FTOPSIS). In injection molding process, an automated resetting of process param-
eters using fuzzy logic is applied to decrease the defects (He et al. 1998). Weld
line is one of the plastic defects which decrease mechanical properties of injected
parts. Fuzzy theory is proposed to control the number and location of weld lines
(Chen et al. 2008).
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), initially developed by Saaty (1980), is another
tool which can effectively evaluate the signiﬁcance of parameters. AHP consists of
three main stages, namely constructing a pair-wise comparison matrix, synthesizing
judgments, and checking for consistency (Vaidya and Kumar 2006; Amiri 2010).
Although AHP has been successfully applied to solve different problems in different
applications, it suffers from some limitations (Patil and Kant 2014). Also, like
TOPSIS it is incapable of handling decision problems which include uncertain

34

Literature Review and Research Objectives
information. In occasions like this, the combination of AHP and fuzzy theory, called
fuzzy AHP (FAHP) is used (Torﬁet al. 2010). The integration of FAHP and TOPSIS is
very effective for multi objective evaluation of moldability index (Cheng et al. 2008).
2.6
Thin Wall Technology in Injection Molding
Chiang and Chang (2007) and Song et al. (2007) state that injected parts such as
cell phone cover are intended to be thin, light and small. Thin wall technology
serves to produce such parts (Liao et al. 2004). High competition between electronic
industries encourages continuous reduction of size and increase of the accuracy of
injected parts. In order to create more space inside the thin-walled housing parts their
thickness should be reduced to 1 mm or less (Liao and Hsieh 2004).
In injection molding, different parameters are involved such as ﬁlling, packing,
cooling, opening the mold cavity, injecting and closing the mold cavity in analyzing
of shrinkage and warpage (Chiang and Chang 2007). The selection of appropriate
process parameters becomes difﬁcult when the wall thickness of plastic parts is
reduced (Song et al. 2007). Huang and Tai (2001) maintain that as the thickness of
molded part reduces below 2 mm, the ratio of skin-layer cooling rate to that of the
core layer increases leading to shear stress of the part which may in turn contribute
to warpage.
Minimizing the manufacturing cost of injected parts is the ﬁrst and deﬁnitely most
signiﬁcant factor in related industries (Ho et al. 2005). Today, cell phones in terms
of dimensions are getting smaller and their durability is important for consumers.
The most signiﬁcant problem in injected thin-walled part is the absence of desired
shape and dimensions. A solution to this problem can be achieved by choosing the
right plastic material and injection parameters. The analysis of best gate location and
the ﬁnite element mesh of the model are shown in Figs. 2.20 and 2.21 respectively
(Ozcelik and Sonat 2009).
According to Huang and Tai (2001) and Chiang and Chang (2007) mold tempera-
ture, packing time, packing pressure and cooling time are the most effective process
parameters related to packing stage. In Ultra-thin walled plastic parts, higher melt
temperature and injection pressure are considered as signiﬁcant parameters (Song
et al. 2007).
Optical lenses are very important injected parts in optical information technology
market (Kwak et al. 2005) where the quality of molded lenses is determined by mold-
ing parameters. Manufacturing of plastic optical lenses require high-precision tech-
niques. Otherwise the injection process leads to proﬁle deformation, resulting from
different cooling speed of polymer solidiﬁcation inside the cavity (Meza et al. 2013).
Yang et al. (2011) evaluated the refractive index variation in injection molding of
optical lenses under different levels of packing pressure by utilizing a sensor based
metrology system. The experimental results demonstrate that refractive index is the
result of density variation, which in turn is resulted from variation in shrinkage rate,

Fig. 2.21 Finite element
mesh of the model and the

is the indicative of considerable amount of variation of packing pressure during the
injection process.
Another defect in injection molding of optical lenses is warpage which consists
of the warpage of reference plane related to the thickness of housing wall, and
warpage resulted from the variation in shrinkage. Increasing the thickness of ribs
and reduction in other wall thicknesses minimize the warpage of reference plane,
Fig. 2.22. it should be noted that the factors leading to the shrinkage variation are
plentiful such as material properties, part design, processing parameters, and mold
design (Subramanian et al. 2005).
According to Lih et al. (2002), unlike numerical prediction computer simulation
has signiﬁcant capability in handling different aspects of injection molding. But the
integration of these two can help engineers to come up with optimal part design and
identify process parameters much more effectively.
In design and manufacture of mold tools, different uncontrollable factors affect
the quality of injected parts which is improved by employing six sigma (Kazmer et al.
2004; Westerdale 2006). Six sigma approach applied by Lo et al. (2009) increased
the upper process capability index Cpu from 0.57 to 1.75 which means nearly 0.07

defects per million; and ANOVA and S/N ratio revealed that the most signiﬁcant
parameters determining the surface accuracy of products are packing pressure, melt
temperature, injection pressure, and packing time (Fig. 2.23).
In addition to warpage and shrinkage of optical lenses, other elements that
determine the quality of optical lenses are light transmission, surface waviness and
surface ﬁnish. The most signiﬁcant parameters which affect the surface waviness
are melt temperature, mold temperature, injection pressure, and packing pressure
(Tsai et al. 2009).

2.7 Research Gaps

2.7
Research Gaps
Based on the thorough literature review in Sects. 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, substantial limi-
tations were identiﬁed as follows:
• Runner in mold design: although many papers studied the effect of process param-
eters in injection molding, a few of them concentrated on runner design. Hence,
further research is required to evaluate the effect of runner design more compre-
hensively.
• Gate in mold design: based on the literature review, a few papers considered the
effect of gate design in injection molding process, but no researcher considered
the effect of gate cross-section which is an objective of this research.
• Plastic defects analysis: although there are a number of papers which evaluated
different process parameters for the analysis of different plastic defects in injection
molding, there is no research on prediction of these plastic defects such as short
shot defect before it happens.
• Optimization tools in injection molding: a number of research studies attempted
to optimize the process via different methods and tools such as Taguchi method,
numerical method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP (FAHP), the
technique for the order performance by its similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS)
and fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS). This research applies a more powerful tool by
combining Taguchi method and FAHP and FTOPSIS which facilitate to generate
more feasible solution to the problem.

ing to determine the acceptable high moldability indices.
2.8.2
Research Methodology and Thesis Structure
The research methodology includes four stages corresponding to the research objec-
tives explained in the previous section as follows:
Stage 1: Development of cold runner design
The purpose of this sage is to propose a new runner-geometry which leads to mini-
mal scrap, lines up with the central ﬂow stream of the gate, ﬁll the cavities leaving
minimum defects, and facilitate the easier ejection of the part from mold tools. The
corresponding methodology consists of: design, calculation, simulation, and experi-
mental modules. The design module proposes a new runner-geometry, namely ellip-
tical, by comparing its efﬁciency, internal and external defects, and scrap reduction
with those of round runners. In calculation module, the dimensions of the elliptical
runner are determined on the basis of empirical data. In simulation module, different
analysis of SolidWorks Plastic in conjunction with FEM such as analysis of different
defects and pressure drop are employed to compare the feasibility of the elliptical
and round runners, and consequently justify the superiority of the former. Finally,
the experimental module validates the simulation results via a real case study. The
detailed framework for this methodology is explained in Chap. 3.
Stage 2: Development of gate design
The purpose of this stage is to propose and validate a new gate-geometry, i.e. an
improved edge gate, in comparison with the current one.
A corresponding methodology consists of four modules: design, calculation, sim-
ulation, and experimental modules. In design module, the quality of the injected part,
internal and external defects, and scrap reduction are evaluated and compared for
the improved and current edge gate. Calculation module determines the dimensions
of the improved and current edge gate. In simulation module, different analysis of
SolidWorks Plastic in conjunction with FEM such as analysis of different defects and
pressure drop are employed to compare the feasibility of the improved and current
edge gates, and consequently justify the superiority of the former. Finally, the exper-
imental module validates the simulation results via a real case study. The details of
proposed methodology are presented in Chap. 4.
Stage 3: The analysis of short shot possibility
In this stage, the possibility of short shot defect is determined by evaluating related
process and geometric parameters before the short shot happens.
A corresponding methodology consists of three modules: modelling, simulation,
and experimental modules. In modelling module, the sprue, the runner and gate are
designed for the speciﬁc application. In simulation module, different simulations

2.8 Research Objectives and Methodology
39
are conducted via SolidWorks Plastics to evaluate related process and geometric
parameters. Also statistical tools such as Taguchi, S/N ratio, and ANOVA are applied
to determine the signiﬁcance of selected parameters. Finally, a real case study justiﬁes
the simulation results. The detailed framework for this methodology is presented in
Chap. 5.
Stage 4: Optimization of process parameters
In this stage the optimization of the process parameters in multi-objective injection
process is implemented via integration of Taguchi with FAHP and TOPSIS to deter-
mine the acceptable high moldability indices. The proposed method consists of four
modules: problem description; application of FAHP with Taguchi; TOPSIS for the
calculation of varied weight and determination of moldability indices.
In problem description module, three common plastic defects namely short shot
possibility, shrinkage and warpage are taken into consideration via FAHP along with
Taguchi method to rate the seriousness of each defect. The simulated results are
evaluated by SolidWorks plastic for 18 experiments using Taguchi method based
on L18 orthogonal array; the initial weight of each plastic defect is calculated via
FAHP. In the third module TOPSIS is applied on three different defects to rank the
above-mentioned 18 experiments based on their deviation from the ideal solution.
Finally, in the fourth module moldability indices are calculated. Finally, a real case
study justiﬁes the simulation results. The detailed framework for this methodology
is presented in Chap. 6. For the details of the thesis structure refer to the Table of
Contents.
2.9
Concluding Remarks
The literature of injection molding in manufacturing system was reviewed in this
chapter based on which four signiﬁcant parameters which determine the quality of
injected parts, namely mold design, part design, material, and process parameters
were identiﬁed. This literature reviews also revealed that there has not been enough
research on process parameters, optimization of injection process, and the effect of
mold design. This is due to the fact that the high number of geometric and process
parameters makes the optimization process very complicated.
Four limitations in the existing literature review were detected. First, the effect
of other runner geometries (e.g. elliptical) on the scrap rate reduction was ignored.
Second, the modiﬁcation of edge gate to reduce the rate of internal and external
defects was not investigated. Third, plastic defect detection was investigated only
after they happen through the process, but not before, to prevent them. Fourth, in
optimization of injection molding process, only the best moldability index was eval-
uated, but no other alternatives close enough. The methodology proposed herein is
to ﬁll the research gaps identiﬁed in this research.

Introduction
The past century has observed the rapid increase of plastics and their proliferation
into all markets. According to world consumption of raw materials by weight, plas-
tic is the highest in comparison with other old materials such as aluminum, steel,
rubber, copper, and zinc. It has resulted from speciﬁc properties and lower produc-
tion cost of plastics (Salimi et al. 2013; Zhou 2013). Injection molding is one of the
most signiﬁcant processes for manufacturing of plastic products and approximately
one-third of all plastics are converted into parts via injection molding (Tang et al.
2006). The application of the injection molding process is increasing signiﬁcantly in
many industries like packaging, aerospace and aviation, building and construction,
automotive parts, household articles and so on (Altan 2010; Tang et al. 2006; Zhou
2013). Three fundamental operations in injection molding are: (1) plastic granules
are converted into a melt; (2) molten plastic is injected into the mold cavity or cavi-
ties under pressure via sprue, runner and gate systems and (3) mold tools are opened
to eject the parts from the cavity (Dai et al. 2002; Hassan et al. 2010; Zhou 2013).
Due to the complexity of this process, different techniques are required to mini-
mize the scrap and improve the quality of the injected parts. The quality in injection
molding depends on material characteristics, mold design, part design and process
parameters (Altan 2010; Khoshooee and Coates 1998; Mok et al. 2001; Ni 2002).
As mentioned in Chap. 1, wrong design of mold components is one of the sources
of defects in injection molding. Accordingly, one of the objectives of this research is
to propose the new cross section of runner in injection molding to reduce the scrap
and improve the quality of injected parts. To achieve this, the following steps have
to be accomplished
• Critical review of the relevant literature of injection molding and the evaluation
of runner geometry which leads to the minimization of scrap and the quality
evaluation of injected parts.

Modiﬁcation of Cold Runner Design in Injection Molding Processes
• Development of a new methodology for cold runner in injection molding. The
proposed methodology is based on evaluation of the new cross section of runner
for scrap reduction and quality improvement.
3.2
Literature on Injection Molding Process and Quality
Evaluation Factors
Four main factors determining the quality of injected parts, namely part design,
mold design, process parameters, and material characteristics are selected for the
analysis of runner in injection molding. Part design heavily depends on customer
requirements and more than 17,000 plastic materials are used throughout the world.
Therefore, these factors are not included in this research. In mold design, the main
purpose of a runner is to transfer the molten plastic from sprue to all cavities via
the gate. There are different cross sectional shapes for runner each of which has
different applications (Pye 1989; Zhen-Yong et al. 2000) (see Fig. 3.1). There are
different techniques in designing the runner in injection molding technology. Also,
the integration of different techniques optimizes the design process (Zhen-Yong et al.
2000). The designer should evaluate different factors for selecting the right geometry
of the runner for a speciﬁc product. The most popular shape of runner for Two-plate
mold tools is round shape which provides the highest efﬁciency (Pye 1989). For three-
plate mold tools, the trapezoidal and modiﬁed trapezoidal are the best selections if
the runner is to be manufactured only in one half of the mold but still they are not
acceptable. This is due to the fact that the gate which cannot be positioned in line
with the central ﬂow stream (Goodship 2004). Hence, various cross-sectional area of
a runner can be considered to regulate the ﬂow leading to a better injection process.
In this section, a brief overview of relevant studies in mold design is presented.
This literature review also provides important key points for the development of a
conceptual methodology for deﬁning the new cross section of runner in injection
molding.
Tsai(2013)proposedthatoneofthefactorswhichdeterminethequalityofinjected
parts is the runner which is a connection line between sprue and gates.
Calhoun and Golmanavich (2002) presented that in cold runner, the main source
of scrap is from runner and gate after de-gating. Hence, different factors have been
evaluated for runner design to demonstrate the signiﬁcance of runner in injection
molding, namely (a) smaller runner size to minimize the scrap; (b) easy ejection
from mold tools and removal from molded parts; and (c) ﬁlling the cavity quickly
with minimum defects.
Ni (2002) stated that the design and location of runner and gate affect the shrinkage
andwarpagerateoftheinjectedparts;andaccordingtoOzcelikandErzurumlu(2006)
different cross sectional shapes of runner can be chosen based on the products design.
Beaumont (2004) deﬁnes a runner as a channel between the injection molding
machine and the cavities to deliver the molten plastic. Also it refers to the portion of

47
molten plastic from the initial point of sprue to the end point where it enters to the
gate. The potential for a runner to affect the size, shape, and mechanical properties
of the injected parts is high.
The main objectives of a runner are:
• Delivery of molten plastic to the desired gating location.
• Minimization of excess material which reduces the regrind, scrap and handling.
• Provision of identical melt conditions to the cavities.
The delivery of molten plastic starts from the injection machine nozzle and ends
in the mold cavities via sprue, runner, and gate. Each of these regions has its own
signiﬁcance. These components affect the injection process, namely the ability to ﬁll
and pack the cavity, the cycle time, and also the mechanical properties of the injected
parts. The overall cycle time for one injection process is a signiﬁcant parameter
which is affected by the cooling time of sprue and runner.
Jones (2008) identiﬁes three fundamental parameters in the runner design as cross
sectional shape, diameter, and cavity layout. There are seven types of cross sectional
shapes available for the runner for different applications as shown in Fig. 3.1.
Goodship (2004) maintained that in injection molding, the most common cross
sectional shape for runner is round shape. In selecting the round shape for speciﬁc

part design, three main elements are (a) smaller runner size to minimize the scrap;
(b) easy ejection from mold tools; (c) ﬁlling the cavity quickly with minimum sink
mark, weld lines and no short shot.
Fischer (2003) proposed that ejecting a runner from the cavity with rectangular,
square, and polygon shape is challenging due to their sharp corners. If an engineer
cannot determine the appropriate cross sectional shape of runner, pressure drops
which leads to incomplete ﬁlling of cavities and high level of heat transfer to mold
walls. Yen et al. (2006) stated that the shape and the length of the channel are
signiﬁcant for achieving the optimal ﬂow and consequently products with fewer
defects.
Based on the previous studies, four key points can be extracted:
• Most of the defects in injection molding are related to mold design, specially the
geometry of feeding system which includes the runner.
• Most of the above studies have shown that the geometry of runner critically affects
the quality of plastic parts such as the appearance and mechanical properties.
• Round cross section of runner has the highest efﬁciency in comparison with other
cross sections like rectangular or trapezoidal.
• Scrap reduction is the key point of the studies reviewed in this chapter.
This chapter attempts to use the key points mentioned above to develop a method-
ology for designing the new cross section of runner in injection molding. Therefore,
the proposed methodology includes the following: a new cross sectional shape of
runner is introduced and compared with round cross section; the calculation of new
design is presented; the ﬂow analysis of molten plastic is simulated via SolidWorks
Plastic and Finite Element Method (FEM); the experiments are conducted to validate
the simulation results.
3.3
Methodology for the Design of the New Cross Section
of Runner in Injection Molding
The main purpose of this chapter is to investigate a new geometry of runner which
leads to scrap reduction, positioning in line with the central ﬂow stream of gate, ﬁlling
the cavities with minimum defects, and easier ejection of parts from mold tools.
For this purpose, elliptical cross section is taken under investigation and accurately
compared with round cross section of runner.
The proposed methodology, Fig. 3.2, consist of four main modules as follows:
• Design module: evaluates the new cross section of runner from different aspects,
namely efﬁciency, internal and external defects, and scrap reduction
• Calculation module: determines the right size of runner with new cross section for
a speciﬁc application.

3.3.1
Design Module
To demonstrate the signiﬁcance of elliptical cross section, the best existing cross
sections to compare with are rectangular and square shape. There are three different
ratios of width/length ( b′
a′ ) in designing the rectangular runner (Pye 1989) (Fig. 3.3).
Rectangular runner with different ratios is chosen based on the part design. Lower
scrap rate of runner and easier ejection from mold tools are among the advantages
of rectangular shape over square shape. Pressure drop is one of the disadvantages
of this cross section which happens by decreasing the width of the square, due to
changes in ﬂow parameters and Reynolds number (Pye 1989).
The comparison between the ratios of circular and elliptical cross is similar to
those of square and rectangular cross section. As shown in Fig. 3.4, D is the diameter
of circle and a and b are the major axis and minor axis of ellipse respectively. a is
constant and b changes based on different industrial applications (Fig. 3.4) as it
leads to further reduction in scrap, easier ejection of parts from the cavity, and
further reduction in cycle time. Hence, proposing different ratio of b
a depends on
many parameters of part design including size and thickness.
Advantages of an elliptical runner over different cross sections of runner are as
follows:
1. Reduction in scrap: the size and volume of runner are the root causes of product
scrap. Hence an elliptical runner leads to less scrap in comparison with round
runner (Pye 1989).
2. Easier ejection of parts from the cavity: elliptical runner, after cooling process
has less contact surface with mold walls, compared to round shape, which leads
to easier ejection of the injected parts from the cavity.
3. Cycle time reduction: the elliptical runner requires less amount of molten plastic;
hence the cycle time which includes the injection and cooling phase time is
reduced.

3.3.2
Calculation Module
Different rules are considered for runner cross section such as rapid ﬁlling of the
cavity, easier ejection and easier removal from the injected parts, smaller runner size
to minimize the scrap (Jones 2008; Knepper 2004; Zhai et al. 2006).
The gate diameter is determined by Eq. 3.1 (Jones 2008).

where S=total surface area of the product in mm2, c1 and c2 are empirical factors as
described in Table 3.1. For most of the industrial applications, this method provides
a reasonable result for gate size (Jones 2008).
For the determination of runner diameter for products up to 200 g weight
and 3 mm thickness, Eq. 3.2 is applied (Pye 1989; Selvaraj and Venkataramaiahb
2013).

where w is the weight of the product and L is the length of the runner.
The calculation of runner and gate dimension is signiﬁcant to be accurate accord-
ing to the following reasons (Rosato and Rosato 2000):
1. Large runner and gate require longer chilling which can prolong the operation
cycle.
2. The increased weight of a large runner subtracted from the available machine
capacity (in terms of the grains per stroke) can be utilized by injecting it into
the cavities and the plasticizing capacity of the heating cylinder in kilograms per
hour.
3. Large runners produce more scrap, which must be grounded and reprocessed. It
leads to higher operation cost and an increase possibility of contamination.
4. In two plate’s mold which has more than eight cavities, the projected area of
the runner adds signiﬁcantly to the projected area of the cavity which leads to
reduction of the effective clamping force available.
One of the main defects in injection molding is short shot which happens when the
dimensions and geometry of runner are not evaluated correctly. This study evaluates
the runner with an elliptical cross section for two thin round plates with diameter of
100 mm and thickness of 1 mm. When short shot is eliminated for injected parts,
it is possible to apply the new cross section for different part design with different
thicknesses.
The ﬁrst step is to calculate the gate diameter of each cavity of 1 mm thickness and
100 mm diameter). The reason for having two round parts with thickness of 1 mm is
to facilitate the evaluation of the effect of elliptical cross section on injected parts with
more than 1 mm thickness. According to Eq. 3.1 and Table 3.1, the following factors
should be evaluated. The selected material for this calculation is polypropylene (PP).
1. S=total surface area of the product (mm2).
2. Values of c2 according to selected material.
3. Thickness of product (mm).

The second step is to calculate the runner diameter. According to Eq. 3.2, the
following factors should be evaluated:

2. Length of the runner (mm).

Finally, the diameter of circular cross section is 2.8 mm. For an elliptical cross
section, by considering the major axis a as a constant and the minor axis b as a
variable, therewill bedifferent ratioof b
a for runner diameters indifferent applications
which needs to be determined.
To overcome the pressure drop as the molten plastic travels through the machine
nozzle, sprue, runner, and gate, the impact of the machine nozzle and pressure
losses need to be evaluated. To ensure that the calculation for the round cross
section is correct, another parameter to evaluate is the maximum pressure drop
along the length of the runner. The runner length is considered to be safe if it is
calculated based on maximum pressure drop of 70 MPa throughout the runner. It
means that if the calculated pressure drop for the runner is lower than the max-
imum pressure drop, the runner dimension is satisfactory (Jones 2008). For most
of the injection molding processes, Eqs. 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 give a satisfactory result
(Jones 2008; SolidWorks 2013).

As the result is well below the maximum pressure drop of 70 MPa, the runner

The result for 0.6a is not satisfactory as the pressure drop is higher than the
maximum pressure drop for the injected part. The pressure drop calculation is not
to determine the best cross section. It is only to ensure that the pressure drop for the
new cross section is lower than the critical point which is 70 MPa.

Simulation Module
After designing two circular parts as two samples for this application, the next step
is to simulate the injection process via SolidWorks Plastic. For the simulation, the
injection system is needs to be deﬁned. Hence, designing the sprue, runner and gate
with consideration of prior calculations should be taken into account (Fig. 3.5).
To ensure that the analysis results are accurate, FEM is used by selecting triangular
mesh (Fig. 3.6) made of polypropylene (PP). Different sizes were evaluated for the
surface mesh. For two circular parts, the surface mesh with element size of 1 mm
is selected. For the injection system (which consists of critical parts, namely sprue,
runner and gate), smaller sizes of mesh are considered. Hence, mesh reﬁnement is
conducted with element size of 0.3 mm for sprue and runner and 0.2 mm for the gate
for both elliptical and round cross sections. The total length of the runner and gate
of the two circular parts with the diameter of 100 mm is 28 mm and the sprue has
60 mm length with draft angle 1.5°.
The next stage is to set up appropriate process parameters. For this setup, ﬁlling
timeis0.59s,melttemperatureis230°C,moldtemperatureis50°C,pressureholding
time is 2.04 s, and pure cooling time is 3.9 s. The geometry and dimension of the
injection system which includes sprue, runner and gate, have signiﬁcant effects on
operation cycle time, cooling time, and different defects, namely sink marks, short
shot etc. (Mathivanan and Parthasarathy 2009). The feasibility of the new cross

Fig. 3.6 FEA for elliptical cross section
section of the runner is evaluated via simulation. Different analyses are considered,
namely ease of ﬁll, ﬁlling time analysis, sink mark analysis; and injection pressure
at the end of injection process. As shown in Fig. 3.7, ease of ﬁll for the elliptical
cross section is in the green area which is considered as the most acceptable level of
the ease of ﬁlling the cavities.
One of the common defect in injection molding is short shot which hap-
pens in thin wall parts or far from the gate if there are long ﬂow distances
(Goodship 2004). According to the simulation results, these parts can be success-
fully ﬁlled and even the ﬁlling time for an elliptical cross section as shown in
Fig. 3.8a is lower than that of the round cross section of runner (see Fig. 3.8b).
Although this difference is 0.0001 s it must be noted that for injecting parts with
thick wall thickness and bigger size, ﬁlling time is one of the parameters which
determine the ﬁnal cost of the injected part. The bigger size of the runner, the more

injection time requires ﬁlling the runner. For bigger injected parts, the size of the run-
ner becomes bigger which leads to an increase in total ﬁlling time and cooling time
(Calhoun and Golmanavich 2002).
Another factor to evaluate is the analysis of ﬂow front central temperature which
represents the ﬂow front temperature at every region of the injected parts to ensure
the new cross section of runner does not affect other factors. Based on the simulation
results, the ﬂow front central temperature in every region of the injected parts is
230.15 °C for the elliptical cross section (Fig. 3.9a), same for a round cross section
(Fig. 3.9b). Hence, the possibility of short shot in the cavities for an elliptical cross
section runner is low.
Another common defect related to the runner’s dimensions and geometry is sink
marks. Sink marks are the depression on the surface of the molded plastic parts
which happen during the plastic cooling process (Goodship 2004). If the diameter
of runner is too small, the cavities do not ﬁll properly and this leads to internal
stresses in the injected parts. When the runner is too small the pressure losses happen
through the runner leading to sink marks due to sealing off the runner before the
injected parts is packed out properly (Calhoun and Golmanavich 2002). Therefore,

sink marks analysis in designing the runner is necessary. No sink marks were evident
in the injected parts of both elliptical and round cross sections except for the sprue
(Fig. 3.10). The surface quality of sprue and runner are not signiﬁcant as they are
considered as scrap at the end of the injection process.
Weld lines and meld lines are two common defects in plastic industry which lead
to weakening or breaking of injected parts. The meeting angle (θ) of the two counters
of molten plastic is used to differentiate the weld and meld lines. If θ is less than 135°,
it is considered to be a weld line, otherwise it is a meld line (Ananthanarayanan et al.
2008; SolidWorks 2013). The weld and meld lines analyses of two cross sections are
conducted as shown in Figs. 3.11 and 3.12 respectively. They do not exist in injected
parts of elliptical cross section of runner. It should be noted that meld and weld lines
for runner and sprue, are not important as these zones are not considering as critical.
As shown in Fig. 3.11, the new cross section does not have any meld line because
the maximum meeting angle of two counters is less than 135°, whereas the meeting
angle for round cross section is more than 135° as shown in Fig. 3.12.
Another analysis which is necessary to conduct is the injection pressure analy-
sis. Based on the simulation, these parts can be successfully ﬁlled with injection

pressure of 42 MPa and clamp force of 19.65 tons. The injection pressure is less than
the satisfactory 66% of the maximum injection pressure limit (based on the selected
injection machine whose maximum injection pressure is 100 MPa) as shown in
Fig. 3.13 (SolidWorks 2013). It can be seen that injection pressure for a round cross
section is 40 MPa which is close to that of an elliptical cross section. Hence, by
changing the round cross section to the elliptical cross section, the required injec-
tion pressure for injecting the materials into the cavities does not exceed from the
maximum inlet pressure of the machine.

Experimental Module
A commercial injection molding granule polypropylene (PP) was employed to pro-
duce two circular plates which have 100 mm of diameter and 1 mm thickness. The
material properties are listed in Table 3.2 (material library of SolidWorks plastic

3.4 Experimental Module
59
2014). Drilling machine, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machine and
grinding machine were used to fabricate the mold tools and fully electric horizontal-
plastic-injection machine—Poolad-Bch series—was employed for the experiments.
Mold design
There are different design concepts in fabrication of mold tools. In this study, a
two-plate mold of one parting line with double cavities with an injection system
and without an ejector pin was employed. The mold tools were made of steel—AISI
1045—with surface hardness of 56 HRC. The runners with an elliptical cross section,
gate, and sprue bush were allocated in the cavity plate after grinding (Fig. 3.14a) and
before (Fig. 3.14b).
In designing the mold tools, another element to be considered is the cooling system
which leads to the solidiﬁcation of plastic parts. Based on the design of plastic parts,
the design for the cooling system varies. For this experiment a circular cooling system
of cavity plate was selected (see Fig. 3.15).

Air vents were also considered in fabrication of the mold tools whose function is
to release the air trapped in the cavity after closing the mold tools; otherwise short
shot happens. Each cavity has its own air vent (see Fig. 3.16).
Process parameter selection
Process parameters of ﬁlling time, melt temperature, mold temperature, pressure
holding time and pure cooling time are needed to be set at correct levels which depend
on the processing guide of the selected material and injection molding machine.
Table 3.3 demonstrates the level of each parameter for the injection process.
Experimental results
After setting up the mold tools and injection machine based on different process
parameters, the next step is to evaluate the effect of the elliptical cross section of
the runner on the injection process. To investigate the effectiveness of an elliptical

runner, the signiﬁcance of ﬁlling the cavities and injection process had to be tested.
The result of short shot analysis (Fig. 3.17) shows that two cavities with elliptical
runners are ﬁlled with no short shot (i.e. completely).
When the injection pressure is higher than the maximum inlet pressure, and the
ﬁlling time is higher than the input parameter (ﬁlling time) of the injection machine,
short shot happens. A most signiﬁcant outcome of these experiments was that, in
comparison with simulation results, the cavities ﬁlled properly even with lower inlet
pressure and ﬁlling time. The comparison of the simulation results and experimental
results is shown in Table 3.4. The margin-error for predicted and actual inlet pressure
and ﬁlling time, calculated from Eq. 3.6, are 7.36% and 3.38% respectively which
demonstrate the robustness of the elliptical cross section.

The signiﬁcant novelty of the outcome of this research is that designing elliptical
runner leads to reduction of scrap rate and cooling time, and achieving easier ejection
of the injected parts from the cavity. The cooling time for a round cross section is 4 s
per injection and for the elliptical cross section is 3.9 s per injection. Based on the
size of the minor Axis (0.8a) for elliptical cross section in comparison with round
cross section (a), and the comparison of cooling time for two different cross sections,
it can be extracted that the elliptical cross section in comparison with round cross
section has 20% reduction in scrap ( 0.8a
a ) and 2.5% reduction in cooling time ( 3.9

Concluding Remarks
A new cross section of runner (elliptical) in injection molding was developed with the
objective of scrap reduction, cooling time reduction, easier ejection of runner from
the cavity, and having central ﬂow stream of gate with runner. The corresponding
methodologywasdividedintofourmainmodules,namelydesignmodule,calculation
module, simulation module, and experiments module. An experiment was conducted
by injecting two circular plates of 1 mm thickness and the results were veriﬁed by
simulation conﬁrming the robustness of the proposed design of process parameters
ﬁlling time, melt temperature, mold temperature, pressure holding time and pure
cooling time for which the margin error for inlet pressure and ﬁlling time were
7.36% and 3.38% respectively. It was also demonstrated that an elliptical runner in
comparison with a round cross section leads to 20% reduction in scrap rate and 2.5%
reduction in cooling time, and easier ejection of runner from the cavity.

Introduction
Injection molding is one of the signiﬁcant processes in industry. It has high man-
ufacturing rate, short product cycle, low percentage of scrap and can easily mold
complicated shapes (Lee and Lin 2006). Injection molding process has different
applications in many industries like packaging, aerospace and aviation, building
and construction, automotive parts, household articles and so on (Altan 2010; Tang
et al. 2006; Zhou 2013). Because of the complexity of injection molding process,
different techniques are required to minimize the scrap and improve the quality of
injected parts. The quality depends on material characteristics, mold design and pro-
cess parameters (Altan 2010; Khoshooee and Coates 1998; Mok et al. 2001; Ni
2002). As mentioned in Chap. 2, one of the sources of defects in injection molding
is the design of mold tools such as the design of the runner and gate. Accordingly,
the objective of this part of the research is to propose a new cross section of gate in
mold tools to reduce the scrap and improve the quality of injected parts. To achieve
this, the following steps must be accomplished
• Review of the applicable literature of injection molding technology and the eval-
uation of different gate cross-sections which lead to the minimization of scrap by
minimizing the internal and external defects.
• Development of a new methodology for gate type in injection molding technology.
The proposed methodology is based on evaluation of a new gate cross-section in
injection molding for scrap reduction and quality improvement.

Review of Literature on Injection Molding Process
and Quality Evaluation Factors
Injection molding is a key polymer processing technology when the requirement is
to make a part from a thermoplastic material with high dimensional stability and
accuracy (Oroszlány and Kovács 2010). Four main factors determining the quality
of injected parts, namely part design, mold design, process parameters, and material
characteristics, are used for the analysis of gate cross section. Part design heavily
depends on customer requirements for which more than 17,000 plastic materials are
used throughout the world; hence these factors were not included in this research.
In mold design, the main purpose of a gate is to transfer the molten plastic from
sprue to all cavities via the runner. There are different gate geometries with different
applications (Pye 1989; Zhen-Yong et al. 2000). Nine common gates are depicted
in Fig. 4.1 and, for selecting the right gate for a speciﬁc product; a designer should
evaluate different related factors.
In this section, an overview of related studies on gates in mold design is presented.
This literature review also describes the necessary key elements for the development
of a conceptual methodology for deﬁning a new gate cross-section in mold design.
Xie et al. (2014) showed the undersized rectangular gate has many adverse effects
on the ﬁlling behavior and residual stress of molded parts. Also larger gates lead to
faster, ﬁlling of the cavity and smaller residual stresses.
Rutkauskas and Bargelis (2007) demonstrated that two factors which determine
the quality of injected part are the type and size of the gate. Oroszlány and Kovács
(2010) proved that different gate types do not affect part deformation or shrinkage
of injected parts in manufacturing of implants of thermoplastic materials, although
some differences are demonstrated in quality of injected parts.
Gokey and Harris (2004) demonstrated that the main purposes of a gate are (a) to
transfer the molten plastic into the cavities (b) to have a control over the melt ﬂow
both in ﬁlling and packing stages and (c) to freeze the polymer at the end of injection
leading to the withdrawal of the screw.
Lee and Lin (2006) conﬁrmed that the design of the runner and gate is one of
the signiﬁcant factors in mold design which leads to an efﬁcient injection molding
process with minimum plastic defects.
Huang and Tai (2001) acknowledged that, in thin wall technology one of the
common defects is warpage which results from the process parameters and gate
dimensions. The ﬁlling rate which is related to gate dimensions controls the ﬂow
process in the cavity and changes the average shrinkage of the parts.
Kima et al. (2003) and Kim et al. (2002) determined that plastic defects such
as short shot or premature failure happen in an injected part which results from
inappropriate selection of gate locations. Appropriate gate location leads to achieving
a better resin ﬂow and shorter hesitation time. Finally, the mechanical properties and
dimensional stability of the injected parts are improved as well.
Jones (2008) proposed that different rules are evaluated for gate type, namely
(a) smaller gate size to minimize the scrap; (b) easier ejection from mold tools and

Dai et al. (2002) demonstrated that the gate or the initial entry point of molten
plastic into the cavities is a signiﬁcant parameter for engineers to evaluate in mold
design; it should be as small as possible to avoid the excess material removal and
visible blemish of the injected parts.
Four key points can be extracted from the previous studies:
• The quality of injected parts is affected by mold design, specially the geometry of
feeding system including the gate.
• The type, design, and the location of the gate critically affect the quality of injected
parts including the dimensional, mechanical, and cosmetic properties.
• The literature review in this Chapter shows that the size of the gate is one of the
signiﬁcant parameters which should be as small as possible to avoid excessive
material removal and visible blemish on the part.

• Reduction in different type of plastic defects is the main target in injection molding
design.
This chapter is to propose a methodology for designing a new gate cross-section
based on the above-mentioned dot points considering the following too:
• The new gate cross-section is introduced and compared with one of the common
one is called edge gate.
• The calculation of new design is presented; the ﬂow analysis of molten plastic is
simulated via SolidWorks Plastic and Finite Element Method (FEM).
• The experiment is conducted to validate the simulation results.
4.3
Methodology for the Gate Type in Injection Molding
The aim of this Chapter is to develop a new gate cross-section in injection molding
which can lead an increase in the quality of injected parts, namely the dimensional,
mechanical, cosmetic properties, and be as small as possible to avoid excessive
material removal and visible blemish on the part. Also, reduction of different internal
and external defects, namely short shot, weld lines, and sink marks, is aimed herein.
The proposed methodology consists of four main modules as shown in Fig. 4.2 and
described below:
• Design module: evaluate the new cross section of an improved edge gate and
compare with the current edge gate from different aspects such as the quality of
injected parts, internal and external defects, and scrap reduction.
• Calculation module: deﬁne the right dimension of gate for modiﬁed and current
edge gate.
• Simulation module: evaluate the new cross section of an improved edge gate in
comparison with current edge gate analyzed with SolidWorks Plastic for different
defects, namely pressure drop, and the feasibility of the new cross section along
with FEM to improve the accuracy of simulation results.
• Experimental module: helps validate the simulation results via designing and man-
ufacturing of mold tools and also employment of statistical evaluation to determine
the signiﬁcant parameters which affect the quality of injected parts.
4.3.1
Design Module
The main purpose of a gate is to transfer the molten plastic from the runner to the
cavities. The most basic type of the gate is an edge gate which has rectangular cross
section (Fig. 4.3). An improved edge gate removes the corners of rectangular cross
section of current edge gate. As shown in Fig. 4.4, a modiﬁed edge gate is of elliptical
cross section. Filling process of an improved edge gate is different from that of the

Calculation Module
In this experiment Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2 (Pye 1989) are used to calculate the dimensions
of the current edge gate for each of the cavities of 1 mm thickness and 100 mm
diameter. The width and the height of the edge gate would be taken as the major and

4.3.3
Simulation Module
After designing two circular parts as two samples for this application, the next step
is to simulate the part via SolidWorks plastic for which, the injection system, i.e. the
sprue, runner and gate should be obtained (Fig. 4.5).
To ensure that the analysis results are accurate, FEM was used by selecting trian-
gular mesh as shown in Fig. 4.6 made of polypropylene (P.P). A mesh convergence
study was applied and different sizes were evaluated for the surface mesh with tri-
angular elements. Finally, the surface mesh with element size of 1 mm was chosen
as the best result for the injected parts. For the injection system (which consists of

Fig. 4.6 Finite element analyses for an improved edge gate
critical parts, namely sprue, runner and gate), element size of 0.3 mm for sprue and
runner and 0.2 mm for the gate were used for both elliptical and rectangular cross
sections.
The next stage is to set up appropriate process parameters. For this setup, ﬁlling
time is 0.55 s, melt temperature is 230 °C, mold temperature is 50 °C, pressure
holding time is 1.97 s, and pure cooling time is 3.56 s based on material library
of SolidWorks plastic 2014, injected material, injection machine, simulation advice,
and human expert. The geometry and size of injection system are the factors affecting
the operation cycle time, cooling time which lead to different plastic defects, namely
sink marks and short shot. After running the simulation, the main factors to evaluate
if the improved edge gate is acceptable in terms of the new cross section and size,
are ease of ﬁll, ﬁlling time analysis, sink marks analysis, and injection pressure at
the end of ﬁlling. As shown in Fig. 4.7, ease of ﬁll for an improved edge gate is the
green area which is at the most satisfactory level (SolidWorks plastic 2014).
Filling time is another factor to ensure that by proposing the modiﬁed edge gate
as a replacement of current edge gate, the ﬁlling time does not increase. Based on
the simulation via SolidWorks plastics, no difference in ﬁlling time was observed for
edge gate and modiﬁed edge gate. Hence, it was concluded that the modiﬁed edge
gate does not negatively inﬂuence ﬁlling time, as shown in Fig. 4.8.
Another quality evaluation for the injected parts is the weld and meld lines
analysis. Weld lines is one of the common defects in the plastic industry which
leads to weakening or breaking of the injected parts. Weld lines can be formed when
two ﬂow fronts meet due to multi-gate molds or inserts (Ozcelik 2011). To differen-
tiate between the weld lines and meld lines, the meeting angle (θ) of the two counters
of molten plastic is important. If θ is less than 135° it is considered to be a weld
line, otherwise it is a meld line (Ananthanarayanan et al. 2008; SolidWorks 2013).
The weld and meld line analyses of the modiﬁed edge gate and current edge gate
are shown in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10 respectively where there are no weld or meld line
associated with modiﬁed edge gate except the interface of sprue and runner, the zones

which not considered as critical. As for the current edge gate the weld and meld line
are at the interface of gate and the injected parts which is considered as an internal
defect.
Another defects related to the gate type and runner dimension is sink mark. Sink
mark is the depression on the surface of the injection molded plastic occurring due
to the shrinkage of material during the plastic cooling process (Goodship 2004). As
shown in Fig. 4.11, there is sink mark on the side surface of injected parts with current
edge gate. Based on the weld line analysis it is clear that in current edge gate the weld
and meld line are at the interface of gate and the injected parts. It has resulted from
the turbulence of molten plastic when the ﬂow fronts meet each other. In modiﬁed
edge gate, there is no sink mark on the side surface of injected parts which results
from a smooth ﬂow of molten plastic into the cavities by removing the sharp corners
of current edge gate.
Shear rate and shear stress are two main parameters which change the quality of
injected parts. Before the evaluation of shear rate and shear stress for the samples,
some parameters need to be deﬁned.

Fig. 4.12 Simple shear ﬂows between parallel plates (Pye 1989)
Viscosity: The melt’s inner resistance to ﬂow processes is deﬁned as the viscosity
of the melts. In injection molding the ﬂow process involves the shear of the melt
which result from the contact surface of melt and the cavity surface. The distribution
of velocity is given by Eq. 4.3 (Zhou 2013).
v1  V
H x2
(4.3)
As shown in Fig. 4.12, one of the two parallel plates is ﬁxed, while the other
moves in a straight line with a velocity V (Zhou 2013).
The shear rate is calculated by Eq. 4.4 which presents the difference in velocity
between the upper and lower side of the volume element in relation to its thickness.
If V is constant, then the shear rate remains steady as:
˙γ  dν1
dx2
 V
H
(4.4)
Shear stress τ another parameter to evaluate is as deﬁned in mechanics of materials
τ  F
A
(4.5)
where F is the total force required to move the upper plate and A represent the surface
area of the plate in contact with the liquid.
The ratio of shear stress τ to shear rate ˙γ is deﬁned as viscosity in Eq. 4.6.
η  τ
˙γ
(4.6)
In injection molding, the shear rate in gate is the highest in comparison with that
of in the runner and cavity. So, local ﬂow rate and shear rates continuously change
during the ﬁlling stage of injection process based on the channel depth and the cross
section of ﬂow (Zhou 2013). The shear rate and the shear stress for the current edge
gate and modiﬁed edge gate were determined via SolidWorks plastic as shown in
Figs. 4.13 and 4.14 respectively.

Fig. 4.14 Shear stress analyses for a current edge gate and b modiﬁed edge gate
The corners of current edge gate increase the turbulence of molten plastic which
in turn leads to an increase in shear rate and shear stress, and ﬁnally reduction in
mechanical properties of the injected parts. In constant, modiﬁed edge gate causes a
smooth motion of molten plastic into the cavities with minimum shear stress.
Another factor to evaluate is the ﬂow velocity distribution for both gates to ensure
the uniform ﬂow of molten plastic into the cavities. As shown in Fig. 4.15, the
ﬂow velocity distributions for current and modiﬁed edge gates are 15.0556 cm/s and
27.6465 cm/s respectively. It is acceptable that in modiﬁed edge gate by removing
the sharp corner of current edge gate, the size of the gate becomes smaller and the
velocity of molten plastic into the cavities is increased.
Another parameter to be evaluated for both gate cross sections is the packing
pressure near the gate and also far away from it. The exertion of pressure on the
cavity during the packing stage is controlled by the reciprocating screw. It is clear
that the speed of molten plastic in modiﬁed edge gate is higher than that of the
current edge gate. Because of the equal ﬁlling time for both gate cross sections, the
packing pressure at the end of the ﬁlling in modiﬁed edge gate does not affect the
injected parts while in the current edge gate the packing pressure is higher as shown
in Fig. 4.16 which leads to damages in the injection machine and the formation of
different plastic defects such as ﬂashes.

Another parameter which is necessary to investigate for the determination of the
right size and the new cross section of modiﬁed edge gate is the injection pressure.
Accordingtothesimulation,thispartcanbesuccessfullyﬁlledwithinjectionpressure
of 46.3 MPa and clamp force of 20.23 Tone. The injection pressure is less than the
satisfactory 66% of the maximum injection pressure limit as shown in Fig. 4.17
(SolidWorks 2013). Hence, the possibility of short shot for the injected parts is
low. The injection pressure for current edge gate is 44.85 MPa and clamp force of
19.98 Tone.

Experimental Module
The parts selected for the injection process were two circular plates of 100 mm
diameter and 1 mm thickness. Drilling machine, CNC (Computer Numerical Control)
milling machine and grinding machine were used to fabricate the mold tools. The
selected material for the injection was Polypropylene and the injection machine for
data collection was Poolad-Bch series.
4.4.1
Mold Design
Based on different applications, different concepts in manufacturing of mold tools
were allocated, namely Two-plate and Three-plate. According to the geometry of
injected parts and the feeding system which includes the runner and gate, Two-
plate mold with two cavities without ejector pin was manufactured with steel—AISI
1045—with surface hardness 56 HRC. The manufacturing of two modiﬁed edge
gates for two cavities was carried out (Fig. 4.18).
4.4.2
Selection of Process Parameters
To ensure that other parameters do not affect the quality of injected parts, setting the
process parameters on a right level is needed. The right level determination is related
to different factors, namely selected geometry for injected parts, injected material,
injectionmachine, simulationadvice, andhumanexpert. Process parameters of ﬁlling

4.4.3
Experimental Results
To study the modiﬁed edge gate in comparison with current edge gate different
analyses related to gate selection were applied such as short shot and sink marks
analysis. Two cavities with modiﬁed edge gate were ﬁlled properly and there was no
short shot defect for the modiﬁed edge gate. Also the appearance of different samples
demonstrated that there was no ﬂash in the injected parts with modiﬁed edge gate.
Pye (1989) states that gates and runners with sharp corners lead to different stresses
related to the ﬂow of molten plastic near the gate or the interface of gate and the
injected parts. The modiﬁed edge gate did not have any sharp corners unlike current
edge gate and also it has a central ﬂow with runner which all together leads to
a uniform ﬂow of molten plastic into the cavities to reduce the scrap of injected
parts. The parts with modiﬁed edge gate were evaluated at the right level of input
parameters as shown in Fig. 4.19 in which no short shot or ﬂashes were detected.
Also, it is obvious that the contact area of modiﬁed edge gate of elliptical cross
section is easier to cut, and it is smaller than that of the current edge gate leading
less visible blemishes, hence less scrap rates (injected parts with high level of visible
blemishes are considered as scrap). As it can be seen in Fig. 4.20, the parts with
current edge gate have ﬂashes at the edge of the parts.
4.5
Scrap Evaluation by Taguchi Method
To determine the scrap rate of injected parts, the mold tools with both current and
modiﬁed edge gate were considered for data collection and Taguchi method which
includes selection of orthogonal array, signal to noise ratio (S/N ratio), and analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine the signiﬁcant parameters affecting
scraps.

mental result into the value which is feasible for the evaluation characteristic of an
optimum parameter analysis. S/N ratio is of three categories, namely the nominal-
the better, the smaller the better and the higher the better. Since the objective is to
reduce the scrap in injection molding via optimum level of selected parameters, the
smaller the better quality characteristic satisﬁes the requirement, and it is deﬁned in
Eq. 4.7.
The Mean Square Deviation (MSD) for the smaller the better quality characteristic
can be stated by Eqs. 4.7 and 4.8 (Tang et al. 2007)

where Y i is the value of scrap rate (the ratio of approved parts to the rejected parts)
and n is the total number of data points. The calculated scrap rates and S/N ratio are
shown in Table 4.4. From the data in Table 4.4, the average S/N ratios are calculated
as shown in Table 4.5 to determine the optimal levels of four process parameters and
one geometric parameter. Based on the orthogonal array (L18), Table 4.4, for each
trial number, 10 samples (of common parameters A, B, C, D, and E) were injected
(total of 180 samples) and the scrap rates were determined. Out of 18 trial number,
trial numbers 1 to 9 are for modiﬁed edge gate and 10 to 18 are for current edge gate.
The scrap rate for 180 parts was evaluated as shown in Fig. 4.21. There is 16.6%
scrap rate for modiﬁed edge gate and 56.6% scrap rate for current edge gate, i.e. 40%
reduction in scrap which is due to the following advantages of modiﬁed edge gate:
• Easier de-gating of the injected parts with minimum visible blemish.
• Reduction in different internal and external defects, namely sink marks, weld line
or meld line, and ﬂashes (as a result of removing the sharp corners of current edge
gate).
• Having a smooth ﬂow of molten plastic into the cavities.

From the S/N response Table 4.5, it can be concluded that the larger value of T
demonstrate the signiﬁcance of each parameter in increasing the scrap rate through
the injection process out of which T is the highest. Other parameters have very
low contribution to the increase of scrap rate. So the optimum set of parameters,
corresponding to the highest value of S/N ratio is A1, B3, C3, D3, and E3.

Analysis of Variance
The scrap rate in Table 4.4 was analyzed via Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and

inﬂuential parameter with a contribution of 86.96%, and the contribution of other
parameters, namely ﬁlling time, part cooling time, pressure holding time and melt

rate.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, a new methodology for the design of a new cross section (elliptical)
of an edge gate in injection molding was developed with the objective of easier de-
gating from the injected parts with less visible blemish, defect reduction, namely
sink marks, weld lines and meld lines, better contact surface between the gate and
the injected parts hence reducing the scrap. The developed methodology consists of
four main modules, namely design introduction, design calculation, simulation, and
experiments through which elliptical gate was developed and veriﬁed via simulation
and experiments by considering ﬁlling time, melt temperature, mold temperature,
pressure holding time and pure cooling time as process parameters and gate type as
a geometric parameter.
The experiment, along with simulation and Taguchi method veriﬁed that, in com-
parison with current edge gate, the modiﬁed edge gate has less internal and external
defects, namely sink marks, weld and meld lines leads to easier de-gating from the
injected parts and 40% reduction in scrape rate. Also, the percentage of contribution
in creating different plastic defects was related to the gate type (current edge gate)
as a signiﬁcant factor via Taguchi method and ANOVA.

The Analysis of Short Shot Possibility
in Injection Molding Process
5.1
Introduction
The most signiﬁcant process for manufacturing the plastic is injection molding.
Injection molding is considered for mass production of the complex geometry of
plastic products which requires accurate dimensions (Shen et al. 2007). One of the
key points of this industry is the advantages such as short product cycles, good
mechanical properties, low cost, and light weight (Oktem et al. 2007). The ﬁnal
quality of an injected part is related to different factors which are part design, mold
design, material and process parameters (Chen et al. 2014; Mok et al. 2001; Modrak
et al. 2013). Injection molding process is unstable repeated work, consisting of ﬁlling,
packing and cooling phases. During the ﬁlling stage, a hot polymer melts quickly
to ﬁll the cold cavity. During the packing stage, the pressure of molten plastic for
injection is increased to ensure that the cavity is ﬁlled properly. Finally, during the
cooling stage, the molten plastic cools down and solidiﬁes adequately so that the
ﬁnal product is stable for ejection from the cavity (Zhou 2013; Chiang and Chang
2007; Hassan 2013; Zhao et al. 2014).
Different factors cause different defects of the products like warpage, weld line
and sink mark during the manufacturing process, but short shot causes the most
serious defects of plastic parts. The evaluation of short shot in injection molding is
very complicated (Oktem et al. 2007; Goodship 2004; Huang and Tai 2001). When
insufﬁcient material inters the mold cavity, short shot will happen (Kitayama et al.
2014). It is caused by different factors such as wrong plastic material selection,
incorrect processing parameters, incorrect mold design, and part design. Hence,
because of the complexity of melt ﬂow process, it is critically signiﬁcant to have
control over the factors of inﬂuence during the injection molding process (Goodship
2004; Li et al. 2014)

The Analysis of Short Shot Possibility …
In this chapter, different process and geometric parameters for reducing the pos-
sibility of short shot defect in injection molding will be evaluated. To make sure
that other factors such as the size of runner and the gate system do not affect the
simulation and experimental result, the selection of right size for runner and gate
system is conducted via simulation and manufacturing process for mold tools. New
deﬁnition for short shot analysis is proposed which will be considered via simulation
and experiments for 18 trial numbers. This approach will address the quality evalua-
tion of injected parts in Chaps. 3 and 4 which were based on geometric parameters of
runner and gate system only. In this chapter, both geometric and process parameters
for a speciﬁc plastic defect will be evaluated. In order to handle the complexity of
proposed method of evaluation, this chapter intends to:
Review the literature on short shot defects and all signiﬁcant factors which lead to
short shot in injection molding.
Developing a new approach for the evaluation of short shot possibility. This approach
is based on computer simulation modelling and Taguchi method.
It also demonstrates the applicability of the developed approach via realistic experi-
ments.
5.2
Review of Literature on Short Shot Possibility
and Other Defects
The formation of short shot on the injected part is one of the defects which eliminate
the overall success of the injection molding process. There are different physical
causes for incomplete ﬁlling such as small shot volume, venting problems, insuf-
ﬁcient injection pressure, low injection speed, wrong temperature control in mold
and so on. The effects of process conditions and geometric parameters on the forma-
tion of short shot on the injected parts need to be understood in order to control the
processing conditions to reduce the ﬂaw (Goodship 2004; Knepper 2006).
Different defects of the products like warpage, weld line and sink mark are caused
by many factors during the manufacturing process, but short shot causes the most
highly defects of plastic parts in terms of the quality. The reasons behind short shot in
injection molding are very complicated and numerous (Oktem et al. 2007; Goodship
2004; Huang and Tai 2001).
In general, a short shot will happen when insufﬁcient material which was injected
into the mold, cannot ﬁll the cavity properly (Kitayama et al. 2014). It is because
of wrong plastic material selection, incorrect processing parameters, incorrect mold
design, and part design. Hence, it is of critical signiﬁcance to successfully control
the factors of inﬂuence during the injection molding process, resulting from the
complexity of melt ﬂow process in the mold cavity (Goodship 2004; Li et al. 2014).

5.2 Review of Literature on Short Shot Possibility and Other Defects

Weld lines will decrease the strength and appearance quality of injected part.
Different process parameters such as melt temperature, injection speed, and injection
pressure and mold design parameters such as gate design will lead to weld lines in
an injected part (Li et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2008).
Sink marks is another defect which reduces the ﬁnal quality of the injected part.
Obtaining optimum process condition and mold design to reduce sink marks, is the
key point to improve the part quality (Shen et al. 2007; Erzurumlu and Ozcelik 2006).
Injection molding process is a nonlinear and multivariable procedure. Conven-
tional trial-and-error method may improve the part quality, but it is so expensive and
time consuming (Shen et al. 2007).
Based on the previous studies, three key points can be extracted:
• Most of the defects in injection molding are related to both geometric and process
parameters.
• The evaluation of short shot possibility is very complicated which results from a
number of process and geometric parameters.
• The conventional methods to improve the ﬁnal quality of the injected part are very
expensive and time consuming.
5.3
A Framework for Developing a Method of Evaluation
for Short Shot
Among 4 essential factors, namely mold design, part design, material, and process
parameters, process parameters and mold design are clearly the essential factors
which lead to different defects in injection molding therefore they are selected herein
for the analysis of short shot possibility. Materials and part design are ignored simply
because it is not possible to do research on the application of all plastic materials
(more than 17,000 in the world) in injection molding and consider all customer
requirements.
With the advancements in Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) technology, simu-
lation of the injection molding process is now an inﬂuential tool to support engineers,
and meets these challenges as a replacement for conventional method. In this chapter,
the CAE technique and Taguchi method are jointly employed to examine the impact
of different parameters on short shot index of injected part to reduce its short shot.
Also, orthogonal array experiment of L18 is selected to ﬁnd the optimum levels
of process conditions and geometric parameters and evaluate their signiﬁcance in
reducing the possibility of short shot for two thin shell plastic samples via the Signal
to Noise ratio (S/N) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

The Analysis of Short Shot Possibility …
5.3.1
Application of Taguchi Method
Taguchi techniques were established by Taguchi and Konishi. The Taguchi method
is a comprehensive quality strategy that conducts minimal number of experiments
using orthogonal array and forms robustness into a process during its design stage
(Shen et al. 2007; Oktem et al. 2007; Yang and El-Haik 2009). An orthogonal array
makes the independent mathematical assessment of the effect of all factors possible.
Hence, design of experiment (DOE) is a reasonable method to decrease the number
of numerical experiments and also acquires enough information which is used in real
experiments (Shen et al. 2007). Taguchi is a technique to predict the signiﬁcant and
insigniﬁcant variables and also optimum level of the design variables by running a
series of experiments.
In Taguchi method, system design using the scientiﬁc and engineering information
required for producing the part is the target; tolerance design, the evaluation and
analysis of tolerances for optimum combination of process parameters are the key
point; and for determination of optimum levels of process parameters to improve
the quality characteristics, parameter design is signiﬁcant (Oktem et al. 2007). In
this section, parameter design is employed to attain the optimum levels of process
parameters which in turn lead to a reduction of short shot possibility during the
production of thin-shell plastic part.
An effectual way to evaluate the effect of a number of factors all together is
to utilize the orthogonal arrays to organize matrix experiments (Shen et al. 2007).
According to the selected orthogonal array, Taguchi technique decreases the number
of experiments which leads to a reduction in time and cost. This special design of
orthogonal array covers the whole parameters with a small number of experiments
and allocates control parameters and design variables to the columns of an array
and transfers the integers in the array columns into the real setting of parameters
(Shen et al. 2007; Oktem et al. 2007). Taguchi proposes S/N ratio to determine the
quality characteristics considered for any problems in engineering design. S/N ratio
has three categories: the smaller the better, the nominal the best, and the higher the
better (Oktem et al. 2007). In this chapter, the smaller the better quality characteristic
is selected to reduce short shot defect through the optimal level of each process and
geometric parameters. Also, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied to evaluate
the effect rate of process and geometric parameters on short shot for an injected part.
Hence, the optimum level of each parameter is determined.
5.3.2
Process of Experiment Design
Selection of factors: There are several process and geometric possible factors which
can affect short shot defects in a thin plate sample. These factors are ﬁlling time,
cooling time, pressure holding time, melt temperature, mold temperature, gate geom-
etry, material type, and part design (Goodship 2004). Since the design of the part is

based on customer requirement, it is not possible to cover all issues in part design.
So the part design factor is not considered herein. So is the material type factor
because more than 17,000 plastic materials are used throughout the world, therefore
is not possible to conduct experiments on all of them. As a result, ﬁve parameters
were selected which are ﬁlling time, part cooling time, pressure holding time, melt
temperature, and gate type.
Selection of factor levels: There are three levels of the selected factors, each of
which is considered using Taguchi method. The reason for selecting three levels (low,
medium, high) instead of two levels (low, high) is due to the fact that three levels of
each factor give more accurate results in comparison to two levels. Different levels
of selected parameters are shown in Table 5.1.
Selection of orthogonal array: According to the number of parameters and levels
which have been chosen, L18 orthogonal array is selected as shown in Table 5.2.
5.3.3
Simulation Modelling
After designing two circular parts as two samples for this application, the next step
is to simulate the selected parts via SolidWorks plastic. For simulation, deﬁning the
right injection system is necessary. Hence, designing the sprue, runner and gate based
on two circular parts with 100 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness should be considered
as shown in Fig. 5.1. The reason for having two round parts with the thickness of
1 mm is to eliminate short shot defect in a critical condition. Also, as mentioned
before, one of the selected parameters for this study is the gate type. Finally, the
round gate and the modiﬁed edge gate are evaluated via SolidWorks Plastics and
experiments.
In order for the result to be accurate, ﬁnite element analysis is applied to the solid
models via triangular ﬁnite elements as shown in Fig. 5.2. The selected material for
injection is polypropylene (P.P). Different sizes have been evaluated for the shell
mesh and injection system. Finally, triangle size 1 mm is selected for the shell mesh
of the injected part and for the injection system which includes sprue, runner and
gate, smaller mesh size was applied. Hence, triangle sizes 0.3 mm for sprue and
runner and triangle 0.2 mm for gate was selected.

experimental result into the value which is feasible for the evaluation characteristic

of an optimum parameter analysis. S/N ratio has three categories. The nominal-the
best, the smaller-the better, and the higher-the better (Yang and El-Haik 2009; Ahmad
et al. 2009). Since the objective of this study is to reduce the short shot defect in
injection molding via optimum level of each parameters, the smaller-the better qual-
ity characteristic has been selected which is deﬁned by Eqs. 5.1 and 5.2 (Yang and
El-Haik 2009).

equals the ratio of simulated inlet pressure to maximum inlet pressure for a speciﬁc
injection machine as shown in Eq. 5.3. The maximum injection pressure for selected
injection machine is 100 MPa. By increasing the ratio, the possibility of short shot
defect increases. Hence, the smaller the ratio the better is the objective of this study.
The calculated results for short shot defect and S/N ratio have been determined and

From the data in Table 5.4, the average S/N ratio for response table can be calcu-
lated as shown in Table 5.5. Also, Fig. 5.3 is plotted using S/N response Table 5.5 for
the possibility of short shot to determine the optimal levels of four process parameters
and one geometric parameter.
18 trials of simulation were taken into account and the result being presented
in Table 5.4. The response table of S/N ratio and S/N diagram in Table 5.5 and
Fig. 5.3 were created respectively. From the S/N response Table 5.5, it can be inferred
that the larger the value of T, the more is the signiﬁcance of each parameter in
affecting short shot defect. Based on Table 5.1, the selected parameters are melt
temperature (E), ﬁlling time (B), and gate type (A) followed by part cooling time (C),
and pressure holding time (D). The optimum set of parameters can be evaluated from
the S/N response diagram in Fig. 5.3 by selecting the highest level of S/N for each
parameter.TheresultisacombinationofA1,B3,C3,D2,andE3.Asmentionedbefore,
by increasing the ratio of simulated inlet pressure to maximum inlet pressure, the
possibility of short shot is increased. By using these sets of parameters in SolidWorks
Plastics simulation, the ratio of simulated inlet pressure to maximum inlet pressure is
0.3306. The minimum short shot possibility as shown in Table 5.4 is for trial number
9. Hence, the new set of parameters (A1, B3, C3, D2, and E3) has the lowest possibility
of short shot for the injected parts.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): ANOVA can be used to determine the percentage
of contribution (PC) for each factor. The largest value of PC indicates the most
signiﬁcant factor affecting the system performance. The PC of scheduling factors

The short shot data in Table 5.4 were analyzed via Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
and the signiﬁcance rate of factors were evaluated by PC as shown in Table 5.6.
ANOVA computes the quantities such as degree of freedom (f), sum of squares (SS),
Mean Square (MS), F-statistic (F), and percentage of contribution (PC). It is clear
that signiﬁcant factors in comparison with response Table 5.5 were mostly the same.
The percentage weigh of Melt temperature was the most inﬂuential factor with a
contribution of 74.25%, followed by ﬁlling time at 22.008% and gate type at 3.69%.
The contribution of, part cooling time and pressure holding time is very low in
comparison with melt temperature, ﬁlling time and gate type.
The lowest possibility of short shot in Table 5.4 is for trial number 5, 9 and 17.
Based on the PC of each factor which is evaluated via Analysis of Variance, it is
clear that the reason for having the lowest possibility of short shot in trial number 5,
9 and 17, is because of B and E as signiﬁcant parameters. Although the PC of C and
D is very low in comparison with A, B and E, the optimum level of each parameter
which leads to a reduction in short shot possibility based on response Table 5.5, is
A1, B3, C3, D2, and E3.
The most signiﬁcant factors which increase the possibility of short shot are
melt temperature and ﬁlling time followed by gate type based on the percentage of
contribution. By referring to the F-distribution statistic table, the F0.05, 1, 17 = 4.45
for evaluating the level of signiﬁcant factor that equal to 0.05 (or 95% conﬁdence
level). Gate type (A) [F-statistic629.3379>4.45], ﬁlling time (B) [F-statistic
1876.302>4.45], and melt temperature (E) [F-statistic6330.234>4.45] demon-
strates that three factors were signiﬁcant to the short shot possibility. The simulated
inlet pressure for trial number 5, 9 and 17 is shown in Figs. 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6
respectively.

In trial number 1 and 11, it is clear that the reason for having highest possibility
of short shot is because of B and E being at minimum level. Hence, any decrease in
ﬁlling time and melt temperature increase the simulated inlet pressure which leads
to an increase in possibility of short shot as shown in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8.

Reduction in level of different parameters from their minimum levels leads to
difﬁculty in ﬁlling the cavities and ﬁnally short shot defect. As shown in Fig. 5.9a,
ease of ﬁlling analysis for trial number 11 is still in green area which is in its most
acceptable level. By reducing the minimum level of each process parameter to 20%
for trial number 11, ease of ﬁlling analysis is in red area as shown in Fig. 5.9b. The
red zone indicates the difﬁculty of ﬁlling the cavities for that zone which increases
the possibility of short shot from 0.56 to 0.70 for trial number 11.

Experimental Design and Results
5.4.1
Experimental Setup
Molding machine and materials: Injection molding machine is required for the
injection of plastic product. For selecting the injection machine, it is important to
determine the size of the top clamping plate and bottom clamping plate of mold tools.
So, based on the need for this research, the injection machine-Poolad-Bch series
and plastic material PP (polypropylene) were selected.
Part geometry and mold design: Since this study is evaluating the effect of different
parameters which affect the short shot possibility in injection molding, a round plate
plasticpartof100mmdiameterand1mmthicknesswasdesigned.Somepreparations
were important to consider for the experiment. In manufacturing the mold tools, CNC
(computer numerical control) milling machine, grinding machine, drilling machine
are the main machines to fabricate different components of the mold tools namely top
clamping plate, core and cavity plates, side plates, and bottom clamping plate. Other
components of the mold tools such as sprue bush, and guide bush were purchased
separately.MaterialcharacteristicsarelistedinTable5.7andMaximuminletpressure
for the selected injection machine is 100 MPa.
Mold design: Based on different concept in manufacturing the mold tools, a two-
plate mold with two cavities and one parting line with runner, gate, and sprue system
but without ejector system was manufactured. The material for manufacturing core
and cavity is steel CK45 with surface hardness 56 HRC. Two cavity plates with two
different gate designs were manufactured as shown in Fig. 5.10a, b. Provision was
made for air vent as it is also important to release the air from the cavity after closing
the mold.

cavity. For ﬁnal cooling before the ejection of injected part from the cavity, cooling
system is a need. The design and mechanism of cooling system is related to the
design of the injected parts. Based on two circular plates, the cooling system has
been manufactured as shown in Fig. 5.11a. Also different components of mold tool
namely core and cavity should be ﬁxed on selected injection machine as shown in
Fig. 5.11b.

parameter. Finally, based on the number of parameters and the number of levels, L18
orthogonal array was used to evaluate the short shot defects in the injected parts.
Also S/N ratio with the deﬁnition of the smaller the better was selected.
Data collection for evaluation of short shot possibility: 18 trials were conducted
via the injection machine and the S/N ratio based on the result of short shot pos-
sibility was determined as shown in Table 5.8.
A few samples from 18 different trial numbers of injection process are shown in
Fig. 5.12.
Based on the S/N ratio from Table 5.8, the average S/N ratio for response table is
calculated as shown in Table 5.9.
The optimal levels of four process parameters and one geometric parameter for
short shot defect is plotted as shown in Fig. 5.13 using S/N response Table 5.9.
Finally, the signiﬁcant parameters which increase the possibility of short shot are
melt temperature (E), ﬁlling time (B), and gate type (A). Part cooling time (C) and
pressure holding time (D) have lowest PC among the other geometrical and process
parameters. The optimum set of parameters can be evaluated from the S/N response
diagram by selecting the highest level of S/N for each parameter. The optimum result
is a combination of A1, B3, C3, D2, and E3.

As mentioned before, using different parameters at levels less than minimum
levels leads to difﬁculty in ﬁlling the cavities and ﬁnally short shot defect. As shown
in Fig. 5.14, by reducing the minimum level of each process parameter to 10% for
trial number 11, the possibility of short shot increased and short shot happened for
the selected part. Uncontrollable factors in experiments lead to a small difference
with corresponding ones from simulation, but both simulation results in Table 5.4
and experimental results in Table 5.8 validate the ratio of the possibility of short shot
for the injected parts.
Analysis of variance: Based on Table 5.8 and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),
the signiﬁcance of each parameter is evaluated by the percentage of contribution
(PC) as shown in Table 5.10. The largest value of PC demonstrates the most signif-
icant parameter affecting the injection molding process. The procedure of ANOVA
consists of four stages to obtain the contributing scheduling factors: degree of free-
dom (f), sum of squares (SS), mean of squares (MS), F-statistic (F), and percentage
of contribution (PC). All the ANOVA results are based on the calculations using
Eqs. 5.7−5.12. The percentage weight of Melt temperature was the most inﬂuential
factor with a contribution of 75.04%, followed by ﬁlling time at 20.19% and gate
type at 3.93%. The contribution of part cooling time and pressure holding time is very

Concluding Remarks
The combination of simulation with Taguchi experimental design method offers
an efﬁcient and easy approach to determine the signiﬁcant factors which affect the
possibility of short shot in injection molding. The proposed approach for the analysis
of short shot possibility based on process and geometric parameters was applied in
order to reduce the short shot possibility in injection molding. The analysis of short
shot possibility was conducted via SolidWorks Plastics and Finite Element method
(FEM). L18 orthogonal array of Taguchi for different levels of each factor was used
based on simulation result. The signiﬁcant level of each parameter was evaluated via
ANOVA and S/N ratio. To validate the proposed method, the experimental set up
was conducted for the injected parts.
Based on the simulation results, experiments and also the statistical analysis of
results, the following conclusions can be drawn:
The signiﬁcance rate of each parameter in both experimental and simulation result
was very close together which signiﬁes the robustness of proposed method in evalu-
ation of short shot possibility. Melt temperature was the most inﬂuential factor with
a contribution of 74.25 and 75.04%, and ﬁlling time with a contribution of 22 and
20.19% followed by gate type with a contribution of 3.69 and 3.93% for simula-
tion and experimental results respectively. The percentage of contribution for part
cooling time and pressure holding time is very low in comparison with that of melt
temperature, ﬁlling time and gate type which did not consider as signiﬁcant factors.
By referring to the F-distribution statistic table of experiments, the F0.05, 1,
174.45 for evaluating the level of signiﬁcant factor that equal to 0.05 (or 95%
conﬁdence level). Gate type (A) [F-statistic48.89257>4.45], ﬁlling time (B) [F-
statistic125.4874>4.45], and melt temperature (E) [F-statistic466.2789>4.45]
demonstrates that three factors were signiﬁcant to the short shot possibility. By refer-
ring to the F-distribution statistic table of simulation results, the F0.05, 1, 174.45
for evaluating the level of signiﬁcant factor that equal to 0.05 (or 95% conﬁdence
level). Gate type (A) [F-statistic629.3379>4.45], ﬁlling time (B) [F-statistic
1876.302>4.45], and melt temperature (E) [F-statistic6330.234>4.45] demon-
strates the robustness of proposed method based on response Table 5.5, the optimum
level of each parameter which leads to reduction in possibility of short shot are gate
type at level 1, ﬁlling time at level 3, part cooling time at level 3, pressure holding time
at level 2, and melt temperature at level 3. Filling time and melt temperature were
signiﬁcant factors which affect short shot possibility in injection molding process.

Injection Molding Process Optimization
Based on Fuzzy Quality Evaluation
6.1
Introduction
In Chap. 5, the proposed approach was designed to optimize single-objective problem
on the possibility of short shot defects in injection molding. The aim of this Chapter
is to extend that approach to optimize a multi-objective problem in injection molding.
In order to achieve this objective, the following two steps are accomplished.
• Critical review of the relevant literature on quality factors in injection molding,
the use of the most well-known methods in the optimization of injection process,
and then focus on the recent methods which evaluate different criteria for quality
evaluation.
• Development of a new optimization approach to multi-objective problems of pro-
cess conditions in injection molding.
Then veriﬁcation of new approach developed in this chapter will then be con-
ducted, using a case study.

Literature on Quality Factors in Injection Molding
One of the most signiﬁcant operations in polymer processing industry is plastic injec-
tion molding for fabricating plastic products with complex shapes, high precision
and low cost (Ozcelik et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2013). Injection process consists of
three main stages namely: ﬁlling, packing/holding, and cooling. At ﬁlling stage, the
molten plastic ﬁlls the cavities via sprue, runner and gate system rapidly. During
the packing/holding stage, the pressure increases to compensate shrinkage due to

temperature decrease and crystallinity development which leads to an increase in
density. Finally, at cooling stage, the molten plastic solidiﬁes then the injected parts
become ready for ejection (Xu et al. 2014; Zhou 2013).
Four factors which determine the ﬁnal quality of injected parts are part design,
mold design, material and process parameters such as injection temperature, mold
temperature, and injection time which directly inﬂuence production cost and its
quality. Wrong setting of process parameters clearly leads to different defects in ﬁnal
products such as warpage which reduces the mechanical properties of injected parts
(Kramschuster et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2010, 2014). Another parameter
which determines the melt injection rate and has signiﬁcant effect on molded part
qualitysuchasshrinkage,warpage,andimpactstrengthisinjectionvelocity(Tsoiand
Gao 1999). In manufacturing optical lenses, process parameters will affect quality
characteristics like light transmission, surface waviness, and surface ﬁnish which
lead to an increase in scrap rate (Lo et al. 2009; Tsai et al. 2009). Also, in micro-
injection molding and ultra-thin wall plastic parts, other factors which determine the
ﬁnal quality of injected parts are process parameters at ﬁlling stage such as melt and
mold temperature, injection speed and pressure, and packing pressure (Song et al.
2007; Tosello et al. 2010).
Another factor which determines the quality of injected parts is mold design. One
of the main criteria in mold design is the size and geometry of the runner and gate
(Moayyedian et al. 2015a, 2015b). The runner delivers the molten plastic from sprue
to the gate which is the ﬁrst oriﬁce through which the materials are injected into the
cavities. Investigations have proved that the undersized gates have opposing effects
on the ﬁlling behavior and residual stress of the injected parts; i.e. bigger gates ﬁll
the cavity faster leading to lower residual stress (Xie et al. 2014). In designing the
runner, wrong geometry or size will change the material properties of the molten
plastic which result in imbalanced injection of materials into the cavities. So if the
temperaturedistributioninsidethecavityisnotuniform,itwillincreasethepossibility
of warpage of, and residual stress in the injected parts (Tsai 2013). The gate type
is a most important factor in mold design. In thin-wall technology, a gate at each
side of the injected part is a suitable replacement of a single gate at one side of
the part. It leads to higher shear rate distribution and then higher melt temperature
and reduces the viscosity of molten plastic leading to ﬁlling the cavities properly
(Shen et al. 2008). The gate location in mold design is another important factor
which affects the quality of injected parts. A number of defects such as short shot,
premature failure, and warpage can occur after unacceptable selection of the gate
location which leads to longer injection time and unacceptable resin ﬂow through
the injection. The right location of the gate leads to minimum time for complete
solidiﬁcation of injected parts and minimum solidiﬁcation during the ﬁlling stage
(Hassan et al. 2009; Kima et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007). Cooling system in mold design
is another factor which affects the quality of injected parts. Investigations show that

6.2 Literature on Quality Factors in Injection Molding

the position of the cooling system leads to changes in the shrinkage rate and the
temperature of ﬁnal product (Hassan et al. 2010). Also, wrong selection of cooling
system will increase the total injection time which in turn affects the manufacturing
cost (Dimla et al. 2005).
6.2.1
Injection Molding Optimization Tools
In the last few decades, researchers have employed various methods of optimiza-
tion in injection molding for reducing defect rates. Warpage and shrinkage are two
common defects in injection molding. To reduce the warpage and shrinkage rate,
neural network has been applied (Lotti et al. 2002; Yin et al. 2011). Taguchi method
is another method employed for improving the quality of injected parts. In determin-
ing the ﬁnal dimension of injected parts, shrinkage optimization plays the main role.
Taguchi method identiﬁes the best level of each process parameter for minimum non-
uniform shrinkage of injected parts (Pomerleau and Sanschagrin 2006; Toe 2001).
For reducing the shrinkage and warpage in thin wall product, Taguchi experimental
design determines the optimum set of effective factors in injection molding (Huang
and Tai 2001; Liao et al. 2004). Two other methods which determine the effec-
tive factors in increasing the quality of injection molding are Fuzzy logic method
and technique for order performance by its similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). In
injection molding, an automated process parameters resetting via fuzzy logic method
is identiﬁed to decrease the observed defects (He et al. 1998). Weld line is one of the
plastic defects which decrease the mechanical properties of injected parts. To have
a control over the weld lines locations in an injected parts and also a decrease in
simulation time, fuzzy logic theory is proposed (Chen et al. 2008). Automatically
resetting the process parameters based on different conditions during the injection
process leads to a better product quality is a capability of the application of fuzzy
logic method in injection molding (He et al. 1998). In general, fuzzy logic is one
of the tools used in advanced manufacturing technology to determine high levels of
quality and performance by reducing different plastic defects such as short shot and
sink mark (Maldonado et al. 2013; Suwannasri and Sirovetnukul 2013). TOPSIS was
initially developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981). It is an easy method to use with the
advantage of having both quantitative and qualitative criteria through the evaluation
process (Ekmekçio˘glu et al. 2010). Multi-criteria decision making is the process
of determining the best option from all of the feasible alternatives (Saghaﬁan and
Hejazi 2005). TOPSIS is not a good tool to use when the information is uncertain.
To overcome this, TOPSIS is combined with fuzzy logic which is called (FTOPSIS).
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is another method used in design of injection
molding to effectively evaluate the signiﬁcance of each parameter. AHP was initially
developed by Saaty (1980) which has three main stages namely: constructing a

114

pair-wise comparison matrix; synthesizing judgments; and checking for consistency
(Vaidya and Kumar 2006; Amiri 2010). Although AHP has been successfully applied
to solve different problems in different applications, it suffers from some weaknesses
such as limitations in applications (Patil and Kant 2014). Also AHP has no ability
to handle decision problems when there is an uncertainty in information (Torﬁet al.
2010). To enable AHP for this purpose it is combined with fuzzy theory, called fuzzy
AHP (FAHP). Also, the integration of FAHP with TOPSIS or AHP with FTOPSIS
for evaluating the quality of injected parts has been considered. To evaluate the
moldability of injected parts, integration of FAHP with TOPSIS is proposed to ﬁnd
the best setting of process parameters which are of the highest level of moldability
as deﬁned in (Cheng et al. 2008).
Based on the literature review, it can be stated that although the integration of
FAHP with TOPSIS and AHP with FTOPSIS are useful methods for quality eval-
uation of injection molding, they are unable to cover all signiﬁcant alternatives,
resulting from limited number of selected parameters and levels. However, to the
best of the author’s knowledge, there is no published work using Taguchi with FAHP
and TOPSIS or Taguchi with AHP and FTOPSIS in injection molding technology.
This Chapter attempts to develop a new approach based on Taguchi with FAHP and
TOPSIS for quality evaluation of injection molding process. The main advantage of
the proposed method is to increase the number of alternatives which in turn increases
the moldability of the ﬁnal product in injection molding.
The mold design and process parameters are two main factors which have the most
contribution in related defects of the injected parts. Hence the best set of process
and geometric parameters will be determined to eliminate the related defects in
injected parts. Two different types of gates are selected as geometrical parameters
namely: round gate and modiﬁed edge gate. Modiﬁed edge gate with elliptical cross
section was investigated in Chap. 4. Warpage, shrinkage, and short shot possibility
are considered as three objectives and ﬁlling time, part cooling time, pressure holding
time, and melt temperature as process parameters and round gate and modiﬁed edge
gate as geometric parameters.

above aim, the proposed methodology consists of four phases: problem description;
application of FAHP with Taguchi; TOPSIS for the calculation of the varied weight
and analysis of the results, as shown in Fig. 6.1 and described as follows.
6.3.1
Problem Description
The number of internal and external defects in injected parts will identify their
degree of quality. Filling, packing/holding, and cooling are three main stages in
injection molding. At the ﬁlling stage, the molten plastic ﬁlls the cavities. During
the packing/holding stage, the pressure increases to compensate the material and
ﬁnally, at cooling stage the molten plastic is solidiﬁed (Zhou 2013). Three common
defects which reduce the quality of injected parts are short shot possibility, shrinkage,
and warpage as shown in Fig. 6.2, all of which are related to geometric and process
parameters. Short shot happens at ﬁlling stage, shrinkage happens at packing/holding

stage which is affected by wrong geometrical parameters such as cavity size, and
ﬁnally warpage happens at cooling stage. Wrong design feature of cooling system
or wrong setting of process parameters leads to warpage at cooling stage.
For rating the seriousness of each defect of the injected parts, a fuzzy evaluation is
appliedbydeﬁningﬁvedifferentlevels,namely ˜α1, ˜α2, ˜α3, ˜α4, ˜α5.Theseriousness
of each defect is determined by using linguistic terms very low, low, medium, high,
and very high as shown in Fig. 6.3. Also, for rating the seriousness of defects,
triangular membership functions with their triplet descriptions are used as shown in
Fig. 6.3 and Table 6.1 respectively (Cheng et al. 2008; He et al. 1998; Xu 2007).
6.3.2
Application of Combined AHP and Taguchi Method
For the allocation of variable weights, a variable weight proﬁt vector is used to adjust
the weights of the selected parameters to determine the product quality. Through
this process, serous defects will be punished by adjusting negative parameters and
slight defects are rewarded by adjusting positive parameters. This waythe level of
punishment and reward is controllable (Cheng et al. 2008).

Variable Weight Deﬁnition and Implementation
The initial weights of all parameters are allocated through the analytic hierarchy
process (AHP). Firstly, the weight of each parameter is calculated on the basis of the
relation between the defects and their related steps as shown in Fig. 6.2. The variable
weight vector W is the normalized product of constant weight factor w (Table 6.4)
and variable weight state vector s. which is shown in Eq. 6.2.

Taguchi Orthogonal Array
The Taguchi method is a strategy to minimize the number of experiments using dif-
ferent orthogonal arrays and creating robustness for different industrial applications.
Taguchi method decreases the number of experiments which leads to reduction in
time and cost (Oktem et al. 2007; Yang and El-Haik 2009). In this research, the
combination of Taguchi with other tools considers moldability indices of injected
parts. Five different geometric and process parameters in three different levels are
selected as shown in Table 6.2. Also, based on the number of parameters and the
number of levels, L18 orthogonal array is selected as shown in Table 6.3.

Topsis
This study considers m trials of experiments and n different injection defects for
quality evaluation. The ﬁrst step is the evaluation of initial weight of selected defects
via analytic hierarchy process. The next step is consideration of fuzzy relative matrix
based on the seriousness of possible plastic defects which ˜R  [˜ri j]m×n. Then the
varied weight of each criterion can be considered by Eqs. 6.1 and 6.2. Finally, the
varied weighted fuzzy evaluation matrix is reﬂected by Eq. 6.3

TOPSIS is chosen to rank the order of 18 experiments each of which should have
the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and be farthest from the negative
ideal solution. Based on the weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix, it is obvious
that the elements ˜vi j of normalized positive triangle numbers and their range belong
to the close interval [0, 1]. Hence, the deﬁnition for fuzzy positive ideal solution

Simulation
Two circular parts of 100 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness were designed via
SolidWorks, as shown in Fig. 6.4, with a feeding system consisting of sprue, runner
and gate. 1 mm thickness is chosen to facilitate the evaluation of defects in a critical
condition and the round shape of injected parts is to get rid of the effects of any
corner or busses. To ensure that other factors do not affect the simulation results, the
calculation of sprue, runner, and gate was conducted based on the geometry, size, and
selected material of injected parts. Since gate type leads to short shot and shrinkage,
two ideal gates based on selected geometry were proposed as geometric parameters
and are shown in Fig. 6.5.
For the simulation, SolidWorks plastic was used. To evaluate the accuracy of the
results, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted with shell (triangles) mesh
as shown in Fig. 6.6. For the injected part the selected material was polypropylene
(PP) and the element thickness chosen for its surface mesh was 1 mm. The mesh
reﬁnement was done with element size of 0.3 mm for sprue and runner and 0.2 mm
for the gate.
The analysis of short shot possibility is conducted via SolidWorks plastic. Short
shot happens far from the gate locations or on thin wall products. It also happens as a
result of insufﬁcient venting (Goodship 2004). In analyzing the short shot possibility
(the ratio of simulated inlet pressure to maximum inlet pressure), different factors are
evaluated to prevent short shot before it happens. The minimum possibility of short

shot is related to trial number 9 shown in Fig. 6.7a and the maximum possibility of
short shot is related to trial number 11 shown in Fig. 6.7b. By increasing the ﬁlling
time, part cooling time and melt temperature to their highest level, the possibility
of short shot decreases as shown in trial number 9. In contrast, in trial number 11,
ﬁlling time, part cooling time and melt temperature reach their minimum level that
leads to a high level of short shot possibility.
Another consideration in this research is the analysis of shrinkage. It refers to the
difference between the linear dimensions of the cavity and that of the injected parts
at room temperature(Fisher 2003). As shown in Fig. 6.8a, the lowest and the highest
shrinkage rate of injected parts is related to trial number 18 and trial number 10
respectively shown in Fig. 6.8b. From the simulation result (Fig. 6.8), any increase
in ﬁlling time and part cooling time decreases the shrinkage rate and any increase in
melt temperature increases the shrinkage rate.
The last defect to be analyzed for quality purposes is warpage analysis. It refers
to a distortion of the original design of the injected parts which results from different
shrinkage rate (Fisher 2003). As shown in Fig. 6.9a, the minimum warpage is related
to trial 11 and the maximum warpage is related to trial 17 as shown in Fig. 6.9b. It
is clear that by increasing the melt temperature and ﬁlling time based on Table 6.3,
the warpage rate of injected parts increases. The warpage analysis is based on the

of the two surfaces of a shell mesh. If the temperature distribution between the two
surfaces is not uniform, warpage may happen.

The injection molding results are evaluated via SolidWorks plastic for 18 exper-
iments based on Taguchi and L18orthogonal array. Three plastic defects, namely
short shot possibility, shrinkage and warpage are considered to determine the best
trial number related to the lowest level of defects of the injected parts. The initial
weight of each plastic defect is calculated via AHP as shown in Table 6.4 based on
their classiﬁcation demonstrated in Fig. 6.2.
Fuzzy logic rating for three different types of defects identiﬁed in ﬂow analysis
via SolidWorks plastic is conducted for 18 trial numbers. Based on their seriousness,
different levels of fuzzy rating are considered as triangular fuzzy numbers as shown
in Table 6.5.

Based on expert’s knowledge, let’s consider α  β  1.25, λ1  λ2  1.5, the
varied weight of each defects is calculated in Table 6.6 via Eqs. 6.1 and 6.2. Then
fuzzy logic is used to evaluate the results of 18 trials for three different defects as
shown in Table 6.7 based on Eq. 6.3. Finally, as shown in Table 6.8, the moldability
index is calculated for 18 trial numbers based on Eq. 6.8. Hence, trial number 2
has the highest moldability index A most signiﬁcant potential of combining Taguchi
with fuzzy logic method and TOPSIS is to have more alternatives of moldability
index. Trial 3 and 6 are of high moldability index and can be applied if setting the
paramers for trial 2 is not possible in terms of injected parts, material, variable cost,
and injection machine.

For instance, for trial 1, the fuzzy evaluating result for short shot defect based on
Eq. 6.3 is calculated as:
(0.5, 0.75, 1) × 0.4347  (0.2173, 0.3260, 0.4347)
As an example, the FPIS for short shot, shrinkage and warpage of 18 trials based
on Eq. 6.4 are 0.5357, 0.2884, and 0.3913 respectively which are the highest level of
fuzzy evaluation on Table 6.7. Also, FNIS for short shot, shrinkage and warpage of
18 trials based on Eq. 6.5 is 0, 0, and 0 which are the lowest level of fuzzy evaluation
on Table 6.7.
The distance of each alternative or experiment based on orthogonal array can be
calculated based on Eq. 6.8:
d+
shrinkage  ([1/3((0 −0.2884)2 + (0.0434 −0.2884)2 + (0.0869 −0.2884)2)]0.5  0.2474

Experimental Module
In this research, different components of mold tools were designed via SolidWorks,
namely cavity, core, base plate, and pillar. CNC (Computer Numerical Control)
milling machine, grinding machine, and drilling machine were used to fabricate
the mold tools. Other components of mold tools such as spring or guide bars were
purchased independently. The two circular parts were polypropylene and injection
machine Poolad-Bch series was used for these experiments. The core and cavity of
mold tools were made of steel AISI 1045 with surface hardness of 56 HRC. The
material characteristics of the selected material for the injection process are shown
in Table 6.9.
6.5.1
Mold Design
A two-plate mold with two cavities and one parting line with a runner, gate, and
sprue were used for injection of selected parts. Ejector system affects the warpage
rate of injected parts. To ensure that other factors do not affect the quality of injected
parts, the ejector system was ignored. Two cavity plates with two different gate type,
namely semi-round gate and modiﬁed edge gate were manufactured as shown in
Figs. 6.10a, b respectively. For releasing the air from the cavities during the injection
process, provision was made for the air vent as shown in Fig. 6.10a.

Orthogonal Array and Process Parameters for Three
Defects
The selected orthogonal array for this experiment is L18, i.e. with 18 trial num-
bers, based on the number of geometric and process parameters and their levels
as shown in Table 6.11. Gate type is a geometric parameter and ﬁlling time, part
cooling time, pressure holding time, and melt temperature are process parameters
as shown in Table 6.10. There are three plastic defects for this experiment, namely
short shot possibility, shrinkage, and warpage, each one of them was evaluated for
each experiment as indicated in Table 6.11.
The minimum and maximum short shot possibility happened in trial number 9
and 11 respectively as shown in Fig. 6.11. Experimental results match with that of
the simulation ones. For the evaluation of short shot possibility, was conducted based
on, simulated and maximum inlet pressure
Parameters of any level less than their corresponding minimum levels (level 1,
Table 6.10) lead to difﬁculty in ﬁlling the cavities which in turn leads to short shot
defect through the injection process. As shown in Fig. 6.12, reduction of the level of
each process parameter of trial 11–10% below the minimum led to a short shot.

Fig. 6.11 Short shot possibility for trial number 9 and 11
The shrinkage of injected parts for all trials was calculated from: shrinkage =
(D′′/D′ −1) where D′′ and D′ represents the diameter of injected parts after and
before shrinkage respectively. The ﬁlling time and part cooling time for trial 18 is at
the highest level, whereas these parameters for trial 10 are at the lowest level. Hence,
the minimum and maximum shrinkage is for trial 18 and 10 (Table 6.12) and shown
in Figs. 6.13a, b respectively.
After injecting different samples of 18 trials, the warpage test was conducted
from: h −ta  z where h is the maximum height of the plate, ta is the average
plate thickness and z is the deﬂection of the part as shown in Fig. 6.14 (Amer et al.

ﬁlling time and melt temperature for trial 11 is at the highest level, whereas these
parameters for trial 17 are at the lowest level. Hence, the minimum and maximum
warpage happened in trial number 11 and 17 as shown in Fig. 6.15a, b respectively.

Fig. 6.14 Warpage evaluations for the injected parts
Triangular Fuzzy rating of three different defects was conducted for 18 trial num-
bers based on the experiments as shown in Table 6.13; and their moldability index are
shown in Table 6.14. It can be seen that trial number 2 is of the highest moldability
index and trial number 3 and 6 are of high moldability indices which means they are
acceptable alternatives to trial 2 if setting the parameters, material, injected parts,
variable cost, or injection machine for trial number 2 is not possible.
Figure 6.16 compares experimental and simulation results which are the same
for trial 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 and very close for the rest of trials. The proposed method
determines a number of alternatives of high moldability index; in this case 10 alter-
natives of moldability index between 0.6 and 1 from simulation and 5 alternatives of
index between 0.6 and 1 from the experiment. Figure 6.17 show the trial number 2

Concluding Remarks
Combination of Taguchi and FAHP with TOPSIS facilitated an efﬁcient approach
to determine the higher and highest moldability index. Taguchi method helps obtain
higher moldability index if the highest one is not achievable. Three common defects
were considered to determine the moldability index. The proposed method was
applied using ﬁve different geometric and process parameters in three different
levels. For rating the seriousness of each defect, a fuzzy logic evaluation was made
by deﬁning ﬁve levels. The initial weight of three defects was allocated through the
analytic hierarchy process (AHP). L18 orthogonal array of Taguchi was selected to
evaluate the quality of all possible alternatives for quality evaluation. TOPSIS was

6.6 Concluding Remarks
135
used to rank 18 experiments. Finally, simulation results obtained via Finite Element
Modelling of two circular ﬂat plates of 1 mm thickness were veriﬁed by experimental
results.
Based on the simulation and experimental results, and also the optimization tools,
the following conclusions can be drawn:
• The moldability index in both simulation and experimental results are very similar
which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed methodology. The highest
moldability index is related to trial number 2 for both simulation and experimental
result. The moldability index for trial number 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 is the same for both
simulation and experimental results and the rest of 18 trials are very close to each
other in terms of quality evaluation.
• The novelty of proposed method is to determine a number of alternatives with
high moldability index. Hence, instead of having one trial number with the highest
moldability index, there are 10 alternatives with high moldability index between
0.6 and 1 for simulation results and 5 alternatives with high moldability index
between 0.6 and 1 for experimental results.

Introduction
The past century has observed the rapid increase of plastics and their proliferation
into all markets. According to world consumption of raw materials by weight, plastic
is the highest in comparison with other old materials such as aluminum, steel, rub-
ber, copper, and zinc, resulting from its properties and lower production cost (Salimi
et al. 2013; Zhou 2013). Injection molding is one of the most important processes
for manufacturing of plastic products and approximately one-third of all plastics are
converted into parts via injection molding processes (Tang et al. 2006). The appli-
cation of injection molding processes is increasing signiﬁcantly in many industries
like packaging, aerospace and aviation, building and construction, automotive parts
and household articles (Altan 2010; Tang et al. 2006; Zhou 2013).
Four main factors which affect the ﬁnal quality of the injected parts are: part
design, material characteristics, the mold design and the process parameters. Since
the design of the part is based on customer requirement, it is not possible to cover
all issues in part design. So the part design factor is not considered herein. So is the
material type factor because more than 17,000 plastic materials are used throughout
the world, therefore is not possible to conduct experiments on all of them. Hence
the focus of this research was to determine the effect of mold design and process
parameters in injection molding to improve the quality of injected parts which leads
to a number of defects in a plastic part.
The purpose of this chapter is to cover:
• Summary of the research.
• Contributions of the research.
• Recommendations for future research.

7.2
Summary of the Research
The main subject of this study was improving the quality of injected parts and opti-
mization of injection molding process. This was achieving by, ﬁrst introducing new
runner cross-section, introducing a new gate geometry, both for quality purposes
and scrap reduction; third, by anticipating and evaluating short shot defects before
they happen through the process; fourth, by evaluating the moldability index for the
multi-objective optimization of injection molding process.
7.2.1
Development of Cold Runner Design in Injection
Molding Process
In Chap. 3, the new feature of runner in cold runner design was developed with
the objective of scrap reduction, easier ejection of runner from the cavity and having
central ﬂow stream of gate with runner. The developed methodology was divided into
four main modules, namely design introduction, design calculation, simulation and
experiments. The simulation and real case study results showed that the new cross
section of runner (elliptical cross section) in comparison with current cross section
(round cross section) has 20% reduction in scrap and 2.5% reduction in cooling time
for the injected parts. Also, easier ejection of molded part from the cavity is another
advantage of elliptical cross section.
7.2.2
Development of Gate Design and Filling Process
Analysis
In Chap. 4, a new methodology for the cross section of an edge gate in injection
molding was developed with the objective of easier degating from the injected part
with less visible blemish, reducing different plastic defects such as sink marks, weld
lines and meld lines, better contact surface between gate and the injected part and
ﬁnally reducing the scrap. The developed methodology was divided into four main
modules, namely design introduction, design calculation, simulation, and experi-
ments. The simulation and real case study results showed a reduction of internal and
external defects of injected parts. Also it permits easier degating of modiﬁed edge
gate in comparison with current edge gate and has less visible blemish of the part
which leads to scrap reduction. There is 17% scrap rate for modiﬁed edge gate and
56% scrap rate for current edge gate.

7.2.3
The Analysis of Short Shot Possibility in Injection
Molding Process
In Chap. 5, the proposed approach for the analysis of short shot possibility based
on process parameters and geometric parameters was applied in order to reduce the
short shot possibility in injection molding. The signiﬁcant level of each parameter
was evaluated via ANOVA and S/N ratio. To validate the proposed method, the real
case study was conducted for an injected part. The signiﬁcance rate of each parameter
in both simulation and experimental result were very close. Melt temperature was the
most inﬂuential parameter with a contribution of 74.25% and 75.04%, ﬁlling time
with a contribution of 22% and 20.19% followed by gate type with a contribution of
3.69% and 3.93% for simulation and experimental results respectively.
7.2.4
Optimization of Injection Molding Based on Fuzzy
Evaluation
InChap.6,theconsiderationofTaguchiandfuzzyAHP(FAHP)withTOPSISoffered
an efﬁcient use approach to evaluate different objectives and also to determine the
best alternative for the best moldability index and better alternatives which were close
to the best alternative for a speciﬁc part in injection molding. By using Taguchi, if the
best alternative is not possible to maintain, there are other alternatives which are very
close to the best alternative and has the highest moldability. It is clear that instead
of having one trial number which has the highest moldability index, there were 10
alternatives with high moldability index between 0.6 and 1 for simulation results
and 5 alternatives with high moldability index between 0.6 and 1 for experimental
results.
7.3
Conclusions
This study has made signiﬁcant contributions to solving different problems in injec-
tion molding process using numerical modelling, Taguchi method and statistical
analysis, AHP, TOPSIS, fuzzy logic validated by case studies.
Contribution 1: Development of a methodology for designing a new runner cross-
section in cold runner system. This new design of runner has valuable impacts on
injection molding; namely reduction in scrap rate, easier ejection of the injected
part from the cavity, cycle time reduction, and central ﬂow stream of gate with
runnercross-section.Anexperimentwasconductedbyinjectingtwocircularplatesof

of the proposed design of process parameters ﬁlling time, melt temperature, mold
temperature, pressure holding time and pure cooling time for which the margin error

for inlet pressure and ﬁlling time were 7.36% and 3.38% respectively. It was also
demonstrated that an elliptical runner in comparison with a round cross section leads
to 25% reduction in scrap rate and 2.5% reduction in cooling time, and easier ejection
of runner from the cavity.
Contribution 2: Development of a methodology for the design of a new cross section
(elliptical) of an edge gate in injection molding was developed with the objective of
easier degating from the injected parts with less visible blemish, defect reduction,
namely sink marks, weld lines and meld lines, better contact surface between the
gate and the injected parts hence reducing the scrap. The experiment, along with
simulation and Taguchi method veriﬁed that, in comparison with current edge gate,
the modiﬁed edge gate has less internal and external defects, namely sink marks, weld
and meld lines leads to easier degating from the injected parts and 40% reduction in
scrape rate. Also, the percentage of contribution in creating different plastic defects
was related to the gate type (current edge gate) as a signiﬁcant factor via Taguchi
method and ANOVA.
Contribution 3: Evaluation, as a consequence of which reduction of short shot
defects before it happens. This leads to a considerable improvement in quality
of the injected parts. The combination of simulation with Taguchi experimental
design method offers an efﬁcient and easy approach to determine the signiﬁcant
factors which affect the possibility of short shot-diagnosing the defects before they
occurs-in injection molding. The proposed approach for the analysis of short shot
possibility based on process and geometric parameters was applied in order to reduce
the short shot possibility. The signiﬁcance rate of each parameter in both experimen-
tal and simulation result was very close together which signiﬁes the robustness of
proposed method in evaluation of short shot possibility. Melt temperature was the
most inﬂuential factor with a contribution of 74.25% and 75.04%, and ﬁlling time
with a contribution of 22% and 20.19% followed by gate type with a contribution
of 3.69% and 3.93% for simulation and experimental results respectively. The per-
centage of contribution for part cooling time and pressure holding time is very low
in comparison with that of melt temperature, ﬁlling time and gate type which did not
consider as signiﬁcant factors.
Contribution 4: Combining Taguchi and FAHP with TOPSIS offered an efﬁcient use
approach to evaluate different objectives and also to determine the higher as well as
the highest moldability index. The combination of Taguchi with FAHP and TOPSIS
make this possibility to achieve more moldability indices, including the highest
index, though it is not always practical due to limitations of equipment, expenses,
and staff. The moldability index in both simulation and experimental results are very
similar which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed methodology. The highest
moldability index is related to trial number 2 for both simulation and experimental
result. The moldability index for trial number 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 is the same for both
simulation and experimental results and the rest of 18 trials are very close to each
other in terms of quality evaluation.

Recommendations for Future Work
7.5.1
New Features of Gate Design in Injection Molding
The current research presented the proposed methodology to deﬁne the new design
of current edge gate in injection molding with elliptical cross section by removing
the corners of current edge gate. Based on the simulation results, the new design
reduces different internal and external defects. The external defects analysis such as
sink marks and ﬂashes were justiﬁed by the experimental set up. Validation of Weld
line and meld line analysis and also shear stress analysis based on the simulation
results can be an interesting future work for researchers.
7.5.2
Signiﬁcant Factors in Short-Shot Possibility Analysis
This research took a limited number of parameters into consideration and determined
the signiﬁcant ones which affect the possibility of occurrence the short-shot defect.

parameters such as speed of the screw and material type, and geometric parame-
ters such as different cooling systems and different gate and runner geometries for
different plastic materials.
7.5.3
Possible Alternatives for Quality Evaluation
of Injection Molding
Consideration of Taguchi and FAHP with TOPSIS offered an efﬁcient approach to
evaluate different objectives of injection process and also to determine the higher and
highest moldability indices. This research was limited to three objectives, ﬁve geo-
metric and process parameters of three different levels. Further research is required
to increase the number of objectives such as common plastic defects, the number of
geometric and process parameters for more accurate evaluation of moldability index.
7.6
Final Word
The research did overcome the limitations of previous studies in injection molding
process where four main improvements were achieved. The ﬁrst one was new (ellip-
tical) runner via the ﬁrst time application of SolidWorks plastic and ﬁnite element
method (FEM). The elliptical cross section showed 25% less scrap than that of the
round cross section. The second improvement was development of a modiﬁed edge-
gate leading to reduction of internal and external defects. The third improvement
was the new deﬁnition of common plastic defects called short shot and determi-
nation of the possibility of its happening. The fourth improvement was combin-
ing Taguchi optimization method with other optimization tools such as fuzzy AHP
and TOPSIS for analysis of injection molding process to achieve more moldability
indices, including the highest index, though it is not always practical due to limita-
tions of equipment, expenses, and staff.
