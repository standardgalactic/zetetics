With the publication of the 10th edition of The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel in 1985, the
Association of Iron and Steel Engineers assumed total responsibility for the future of this presti-
gious document from the U.S. Steel Corporation. In 1998, the Association of Iron and Steel
Engineers transferred all rights to The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel to The AISE Steel
Foundation. Readers of the 11th edition will obviously note the most dramatic change in technol-
ogy and style of presentation since the book’s inception in 1919.
In 1995, The AISE Steel Foundation formed an MSTS Steering Committee to oversee the creation
of the 11th edition, and this committee looked out at a vastly different steel industry than that of
the 10th edition. Hence, a new publication concept was deemed necessary, and this concept had to
be consistent with the massive changes in steel industry economics that had occurred during the
1980s and early 1990s. These changes were occasioned by restructuring, downsizing, and whole-
sale implementation of new and improved technology. In turn, these changes produced major
increases in labor productivity, huge reductions in energy consumption, and vastly improved
yields. Concomitant with these improvements, the steel marketplace saw the introduction of a host
of new and improved products.
Given the backdrop of the industry’s transformation, the Steering Committee deemed a revision to
the 10th edition in its current format to be impractical, and therefore decided the 11th edition would
be a series of separate volumes dealing with specific subjects. These initial volumes, along with
their scheduled publication dates, are:
Ironmaking Volume (1999)
Steelmaking and Refining Volume (1998)
Casting Volume (2000)
Flat Products Volume (2001)
Long Products Volume (2002)
The separate volume concept was implemented by selecting Volume Chairpersons who were rec-
ognized as world leaders in their respective fields of technology. These leaders, in turn, recruited
a team of top-notch authors to create the individual chapters. The leaders and expert auhors, many
with backgrounds in the Association of Iron and Steel Engineers and the Iron and Steel Society,
came from individual steel companies, the steel industry supplier base, and several universities
with close associations with the steel industries. Thus, for the first time, the MSTS represents a
broad and diverse view of steel technology as seen from various vantage points within industry
and academe.

Despite all the changes to be found in the 11th edition, the MSTS Steering Committee has held on
to certain traditions. One such tradition has been to provide to a wide audience (or readership)
within the steel industry a basic reference containing the current practices and latest technology
used in the making, shaping, and treating of steel. The primary readership targets are university stu-
dents (technical knowledge), steel producers (training and technology implementation), and cus-
tomers and suppliers (technical orientation and reference). As noted by the author of the 1st edition
in 1919, “the book was written for . . . (those) . . . who are seeking self-instruction.” The 11th edi-
tion attempts to maintain that tradition by incorporating technical information at several different
levels of complexity and detail, thereby offering information of value to a wide-ranging readership.
The Ironmaking Volume and the Steelmaking and Refining Volume, both being published in the
same year, contain common information on physical chemistry and kinetics, refractories, industrial
gases, and fuels and water to make each book self-sufficient. The Ironmaking Volume includes
descriptions of the newly emerging field of alternative iron production, and the Steelmaking and
Refining Volume includes updated information on EAF technology and secondary refining, and
new information on alternatives to conventional steelmaking. The Casting Volume, to be published
in 1999, will include new information on near-net-shape and strip casting, as well as updated infor-
mation on ingot teeming and conventional continuous casting.
The AISE Steel Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement of the iron and steel industry
of North America through training, publications, research, electronic resources and other related
programs of benefit to the industry, receives the benefits of all sales of this publication.
In closing, the MSTS Steering Committee wants to personally thank all of the authors who have
contributed their time and expertise to make the 11th edition a reality.

1.1 Introduction
This volume examines the basic principles, equipment and operating practices involved in steel-
making and refining. In this introductory chapter the structure of this volume is briefly described.
Also the evolution of steelmaking processes from about 1850 to the present is given along with
statistics on current production by process and speculation on future trends.
For the purpose of this volume steelmaking can be roughly defined as the refining or removal of
unwanted elements or other impurities from hot metal produced in a blast furnace or similar
process or the melting and refining of scrap and other forms of iron in a melting furnace, usually
an electric arc furnace (EAF). Currently most all of the hot metal produced in the world is refined
in an oxygen steelmaking process (OSM). A small amount of hot metal is refined in open hearths,
cast into pigs for use in an EAF or refined in other processes. The major element removed in OSM
is carbon which is removed by oxidation to carbon monoxide (CO). Other elements such as sili-
con, phosphorous, sulfur and manganese are transferred to a slag phase. In the EAF steelmaking
process the chemical reactions are similar but generally less extensive.
After treating the metal in an OSM converter or an EAF it is further refined in the ladle. This is
commonly called secondary refining or ladle metallurgy and the processes include deoxidation,
desulfurization and vacuum degassing. For stainless steelmaking the liquid iron-chromium-nickel
metal is refined in an argon-oxygen decarburization vessel (AOD), a vacuum oxygen decarbur-
ization vessel (VOD) or a similar type process.
In this volume the fundamental physical chemistry and kinetics relevant to the production of iron
and steel is reviewed. Included are the critical thermodynamic data and other data on the proper-
ties of iron alloys and slags relevant to iron and steelmaking. This is followed by chapters on the
support technologies for steelmaking including fuels and water, the production of industrial gases
and the fundamentals and application of refractories. This volume then describes and analyzes the
individual refining processes in detail including hot metal treatments, oxygen steelmaking, EAF
steelmaking, AOD and VOD stainless steelmaking and secondary refining. Finally future alterna-
tives to oxygen and EAF steelmaking are examined.

In the 10th edition of The Making Shaping and Treating of Steel1 there is an excellent detailed
review of early steelmaking processes such as the cementation and the crucible processes. A new
discussion of these is not necessary. The developments of modern steelmaking processes such as

the Bessemer, open hearth, oxygen steelmaking and EAF have also been chronicled in detail in the
10th edition. In this volume only a summary of these processes is given. For more details the

1.2.1 Bottom-Blown Acid or Bessemer Process
This process, developed independently by William Kelly of Eddyville, Kentucky and Henry
Bessemer of England, involved blowing air through a bath of molten pig iron contained in a bot-
tom-blown vessel lined with acid (siliceous) refractories. The process was the first to provide a
large scale method whereby pig iron could rapidly and cheaply be refined and converted into liq-
uid steel. Bessemer’s American patent was issued in 1856; although Kelly did not apply for a
patent until 1857, he was able to prove that he had worked on the idea as early as 1847. Thus, both
men held rights to the process in this country; this led to considerable litigation and delay, as dis-
cussed later. Lacking financial means, Kelly was unable to perfect his invention and Bessemer, in
the face of great difficulties and many failures, developed the process to a high degree of perfec-
tion and it came to be known as the acid Bessemer process.
The fundamental principle proposed by
Bessemer and Kelly was that the oxidation
of the major impurities in liquid blast fur-
nace iron (silicon, manganese and carbon)
was preferential and occurred before the
major oxidation of iron; the actual mecha-
nism differs from this simple explanation, as
outlined in the discussion of the physical
chemistry of steelmaking in Chapter 2.
Further, they discovered that sufficient heat
was generated in the vessel by the chemical
oxidation of the above elements in most
types of pig iron to permit the simple blow-
ing of cold air through molten pig iron to
produce liquid steel without the need for an
external source of heat. Because the process
converted pig iron to steel, the vessel in
which the operation was carried out came to
be known as a converter. The principle of the
bottom blown converter is shown schemati-
cally in Fig. 1.1.
At first, Bessemer produced satisfactory
steel in a converter lined with siliceous
(acid) refractories by refining pig iron that,
smelted from Swedish ores, was low in
phosphorus, high in manganese, and contained enough silicon to meet the thermal needs of the
process. But, when applied to irons which were higher in phosphorus and low in silicon and man-
ganese, the process did not produce satisfactory steel. In order to save his process in the face of
opposition among steelmakers, Bessemer built a steel works at Sheffield, England, and began to
operate in 1860. Even when low phosphorus Swedish pig iron was employed, the steels first pro-
duced there contained much more than the admissible amounts of oxygen, which made the steel
“wild” in the molds. Difficulty also was experienced with sulfur, introduced from the coke used
as the fuel for melting the iron in cupolas, which contributed to “hot shortness” of the steel. These
objections finally were overcome by the addition of manganese in the form of spiegeleisen to the
steel after blowing as completed.
The beneficial effects of manganese were disclosed in a patent by R. Mushet in 1856. The carbon
and manganese in the spiegeleisen served the purpose of partially deoxidizing the steel, which part

of the manganese combined chemically with some of the sulfur to form compounds that either
floated out of the metal into the slag, or were comparatively harmless if they remained in the steel.
As stated earlier, Bessemer had obtained patents in England and in this country previous to Kelly’s
application; therefore, both men held rights to the process in the United States.
The Kelly Pneumatic Process Company had been formed in 1863 in an arrangement with William
Kelly for the commercial production of steel by the new process. This association included the
Cambria Iron Company; E.B.Ward; Park Brothers and Company; Lyon, Shord and Company; Z.S.
Durfee and , later, Chouteau, Harrison and Vale. This company, in 1864, built the first commercial
Bessemer plant in this country, consisting of a 2.25 metric ton (2.50 net ton) acid lined vessel
erected at the Wyandotte Iron Works, Wyandotte, Michigan, owned by Captain E.B. Ward. It may
be mentioned that a Kelly converter was used experimentally at the Cambria Works, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania as early as 1861.
As a result of the dual rights to the process a second group consisting of Messrs. John A. Griswold
and John F. Winslow of Troy, New York and A. L. Holley formed another company under an
arrangement with Bessemer in 1864. This group erected an experimental 2.25 metric ton (2.50 net
ton) vessel in Troy, New York which commenced operations on February 16, 1865. After much lit-
igation had failed to gain for either sole control of the patents for the pneumatic process in
America, the rival organizations decided to combine their respective interests early in 1866. This
larger organization was then able to combine the best features covered by the Kelly and Bessemer
patents, and the application of the process advanced rapidly.
By 1871, annual Bessemer steel production in the United States had increased to approximately
40,800 metric tons (45,000 net tons), about 55% of the total steel production, which was produced
by seven Bessemer plants.
Bessemer steel production in the United States over an extended period of years remained signif-
icant; however, raw steel is no longer being produced by the acid Bessemer process in the United
States. the last completely new plant for the production of acid Bessemer steel ingots in the United
States was built in 1949.
As already stated, the bottom blown acid process known generally as the Bessemer Process was the
original pneumatic steelmaking process. Many millions of tons of steel were produced by this method.
From 1870 to 1910, the acid Bessemer process produced the majority of the world’s supply of steel.
The success of acid Bessemer steelmaking was dependent upon the quality of pig iron available
which, in turn, demanded reliable supplies of iron ore and metallurgical coke of relatively high
purity. At the time of the invention of the process, large quantities of suitable ores were available,
both abroad and in the United States. With the gradual depletion of high quality ores abroad (par-
ticularly low phosphorus ores) and the rapid expansion of the use of the bottom blown basic pneu-
matic, basic open hearth and basic oxygen steelmaking processes over the years, acid Bessemer
steel production has essentially ceased in the United Kingdom and Europe.
In the United States, the Mesabi Range provided a source of relatively high grade ore for making iron
for the acid Bessemer process for many years. In spite of this, the acid Bessemer process declined from
a major to a minor steelmaking method in the United States and eventually was abandoned.
The early use of acid Bessemer steel in this country involved production of a considerable quan-
tity of rail steel, and for many years (from its introduction in 1864 until 1908) this process was the
principal steelmaking process. Until relatively recently, the acid Bessemer process was used prin-
cipally in the production of steel for buttwelded pipe, seamless pipe, free machining bars, flat
rolled products, wire, steel castings, and blown metal for the duplex process.
Fully killed acid Bessemer steel was used for the first time commercially by United States Steel
Corporation in the production of seamless pipe. In addition, dephosphorized acid Bessemer steel
was used extensively in the production of welded pipe and galvanized sheets.

1.2.2 Basic Bessemer or Thomas Process
The bottom blown basic pneumatic process, known by several names including Thomas, Thomas-
Gilchrist or basic Bessemer process, was patented in 1879 by Sidney G. Thomas in England. The
process, involving the use of the basic lining and a basic flux in the converter, made it possible to
use the pneumatic method for refining pig irons smelted from the high phosphorus ores common
to many sections of Europe. The process (never adopted in the United States) developed much more
rapidly in Europe than in Great Britain and, in 1890, European production was over 1.8 million met-
ric tons (2 million net tons) as compared with 0.36 million metric tons (400,000 net tons) made in
Great Britain.
The simultaneous development of the basic open hearth process resulted in a decline of produc-
tion of steel by the bottom blown basic pneumatic process in Europe and, by 1904, production of
basic open hearth steel there exceeded that of basic pneumatic steel. From 1910 on, the bottom
blown basic pneumatic process declined more or less continuously percentage-wise except for the
period covering World War II, after which the decline resumed.
1.2.3 Open Hearth Process
Karl Wilhelm Siemens, by 1868, proved that it was possible to oxidize the carbon in liquid pig iron
using iron ore, the process was initially known as the “pig and ore process.” 
Briefly, the method of Siemens was as follows. A rectangular covered hearth was used to con-
tain the charge of pig iron or pig iron and scrap. (See Fig.1.2) Most of the heat required to pro-
mote the chemical reactions necessary for purification of the charge was provided by passing

Fig. 1.2 Schematic arrangement of an early type of Siemens furnace with about a 4.5 metric ton (5 net ton) capacity. The
roof of this design (which was soon abandoned) dipped from the ends toward the center of the furnace to force the flame
downward on the bath. Various different arrangements of gas and air ports were used in later furnaces. Note that in this
design, the furnace proper was supported on the regenerator arches. Flow of gas, air and waste gases were reversed by
changing the position of the two reversing valves. The inset at the upper left compares the size of one of these early fur-
naces with that of a late generation 180 metric ton (200 net ton) open hearth.

burning fuel gas over the top of the materials. The fuel gas, with a quantity of air more than
sufficient to burn it, was introduced through ports at each end of the furnace, alternately at one
end and then the other. The products of combustion passed out of the port temporarily not used
for entrance of gas and air, and entered chambers partly filled with brick checkerwork. This
checkerwork, commonly called checkers, provided a multitude of passageways for the exit of
the gases to the stack. During their passage through the checkers, the gases gave up a large part
of their heat to the brickwork. After a short time, the gas and air were shut off at the one end
and introduced into the furnace through the preheated checkers, absorbing some of the heat
stored in these checkers The gas and air were thus preheated to a somewhat elevated tempera-
ture, and consequently developed to a higher temperature in combustion than could be obtained
without preheating. In about twenty minutes, the flow of the gas and air was again reversed so
that they entered the furnace through the checkers and port used first; and a series of such
reversals, occurring every fifteen or twenty minutes was continued until the heat was finished.
The elements in the bath which were oxidized both by the oxygen of the air in the furnace
atmosphere and that contained in the iron ore fed to the bath, were carbon, silicon and man-
ganese, all three of which could be reduced to as low a limit as was possible in the Bessemer
process. Of course, a small amount of iron remains or is oxidized and enters the slag.
Thus, as in all other processes for purifying pig iron, the basic principle of the Siemens process
was that of oxidation. However, in other respects, it was unlike any other process. True, it resem-
bled the puddling process in both the method and the agencies employed, but the high tempera-
tures attainable in the Siemens furnace made it possible to keep the final product molten and free
of entrapped slag. The same primary result was obtained as in the Bessemer process, but by a dif-
ferent method and through different agencies, both of which imparted to steel made by the new
process properties somewhat different from Bessemer steel, and gave the process itself certain
metallurgical advantages over the older pneumatic process, as discussed later in this section.
As would be expected, many variations of the process, both mechanical and metallurgical, have
been worked out since its original conception. Along mechanical lines, various improvements in
the design, the size and the arrangement of the parts of the furnace have been made. Early furnaces
had capacities of only about 3.5–4.5 metric tons (4–5 net tons), which modern furnaces range from
about 35–544 metric tons (40–600 net tons) in capacity, with the majority having capacities
between about 180–270 metric tons (200–300 net tons).
The Siemens process became known more generally, as least in the United States, as the open hearth
process. The name “open hearth” was derived, probably, from the fact that the steel, while melted on
a hearth under a roof, was accessible through the furnace doors for inspection, sampling, and testing.
The hearth of Siemens’furnace was of acid brick construction, on top of which the bottom was made
up of sand, essentially as in the acid process of today. Later, to permit the charging of limestone and
use of a basic slag for removal of phosphorus, the hearth was constructed with a lining of magnesite
brick, covered with a layer of burned dolomite or magnesite, replacing the siliceous bottom of the
acid furnace. These furnaces, therefore, were designated as basic furnaces, and the process carried
out in them was called the basic process. The pig and scrap process was originated by the Martin
brothers, in France, who, by substituting scrap for the ore in Siemens’ pig and ore process, found it
possible to dilute the change with steel scrap to such an extent that less oxidation was necessary.
The advantages offered by the Siemens process may be summarized briefly as follows: 
1. By the use of iron ore as an oxidizing agent and by the external application of heat,
the temperature of the bath was made independent of the purifying reactions, and
the elimination of impurities could be made to take place gradually, so that both the
temperature and composition of the bath were under much better control than in the
Bessemer process.
2. For the same reasons, a greater variety of raw materials could be used (particularly
scrap, not greatly consumable in the Bessemer converter) and a greater variety of
products could be made by the open hearth process than by the Bessemer process.

3. A very important advantage was the increased yield of finished steel from a given
quantity of pig iron as compared to the Bessemer process, because of lower inher-
ent sources of iron loss in the former, as well as because of recovery of the iron con-
tent of the ore used for oxidation in the open hearth.
4. Finally, with the development of the basic open hearth process, the greatest advan-
tage of Siemens’ over the acid Bessemer process was made apparent, as the basic
open hearth process is capable of eliminating phosphorus from the bath. While this
element can be removed also in the basic Bessemer (Thomas-Gilchrist) process, it is
to be noted that, due to the different temperature conditions, phosphorus is elimi-
nated before carbon in the basic open hearth process, whereas the major proportion
of phosphorus is not oxidized in the basic Bessemer process until after carbon in the
period termed the afterblow. Hence, while the basic Bessemer process requires a pig
iron with a phosphorus content of 2.0% or more in order to maintain the tempera-
ture high enough for the afterblow, the basic open hearth process permits the eco-
nomical use of iron of any phosphorus content up to 1.0%. In the United States, this
fact was of importance since it made available immense iron ore deposits which
could not be utilized otherwise because of their phosphorus content, which was too
high to permit their use in the acid Bessemer or acid open hearth process and too
low for use in the basic Bessemer process.
The open hearth process became the dominant process in the United States. As early as 1868, a
small open hearth furnace was built at Trenton, New Jersey, but satisfactory steel at a reasonable
cost did not result and the furnace was abandoned. Later, at Boston, Massachusetts, a successful
furnace was designed and operated, beginning in 1870. Following this success, similar furnaces
were built at Nashua, New Hampshire and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the latter by Singer,
Nimick and Company, in 1871. The Otis Iron and Steel Company constructed two 6.3 metric ton
(7 net ton) furnaces at their Lakeside plant at Cleveland, Ohio in 1874. Two 13.5 metric ton (15
net ton) furnaces were added to this plant in 1878, two more of the same size in 1881, and two
more in 1887. All of these furnaces had acid linings, using a sand bottom for the hearths.
The commercial production of steel by the basic process was achieved first at Homestead,
Pennsylvania. The initial heat was tapped March 28, 1888. By the close of 1890, there were 16 basic
open hearth furnaces operating. From 1890 to 1900, magnesite for the bottom began to be imported
regularly and the manufacture of silica refractories for the roof was begun in American plants. For
these last two reasons, the construction of basic furnaces advanced rapidly and, by 1900, furnaces
larger than 45 metric tons (50 net tons) were being planned.
While the Bessemer process could produce steel at a possibly lower cost above the cost of materi-
als, it was restricted to ores of a limited phosphorus content and its use of scrap was also limited.
The open hearth was not subject to these restrictions, so that the annual production of steel by the
open hearth process increased rapidly, and in 1908, passed the total tonnage produced yearly by
the Bessemer process. Total annual production of Bessemer steel ingots decreased rather steadily
after 1908, and has ceased entirely in the United States. In addition to the ability of the basic open
hearth furnace to utilize irons made from American ores, as discussed earlier, the main reasons for
proliteration of the open hearth process were its ability to produce steels of many compositions
and its ability to use a large proportion of iron and steel scrap, if necessary. Also steels made by
any of the pneumatic processes that utilize air for blowing contain more nitrogen than open hearth
steels; this higher nitrogen content made Bessemer steel less desirable than open hearth steel in
some  important applications.
With the advent of oxygen steelmaking which could produce steel in a fraction of the time required
by the open hearth process, open hearth steelmaking has been completely phased out in the United
States. The last open hearth meltshop closed at Geneva Steel Corporation at Provo, Utah in 1991.
Worldwide there are only a relative few open hearths still producing steel.

1.2.4 Oxygen Steelmaking
Oxygen steelmaking has become the dominant method of producing steel from blast furnace hot
metal. Although the use of gaseous oxygen (rather than air) as the agent for refining molten pig iron
and scrap mixtures to produce steel by pneumatic processes received the attention of numerous
investigators from Bessemer onward, it was not until after World War II that commercial success
was attained.
Blowing with oxygen was investigated by R. Durrer and C. V. Schwarz in Germany and by Durrer and
Hellbrugge in Switzerland. Bottom-blown basic lined vessels of the designs they used proved unsuit-
able because the high temperature attained caused rapid deterioration of the refractory tuyere bottom;
blowing pressurized oxygen downwardly against the top surface of the molten metal bath, however, was
found to convert the charge to steel with a high degree of thermal and chemical efficiency.
Plants utilizing top blowing with oxygen
have been in operation since 1952–53 at Linz
and Donawitz in Austria. These operations,
sometimes referred to as the Linz-Donawitz
or L-D process were designed to employ pig
iron produced from local ores that are high in
manganese and low in phosphorus; such iron
is not suitable for either the acid or basic bot-
tom blown pneumatic process utilizing air for
blowing. The top blown process, however, is
adapted readily to the processing of blast fur-
nace metal of medium and high phosphorus
contents and is particularly attractive where it
is desirable to employ a steelmaking process
requiring large amounts of hot metal as the
principal source of metallics. This adaptabil-
ity has led to the development of numerous
variations in application of the top-blown
principle. In its most widely used form,
which also is the form used in the United
States, the top blown oxygen process is
called the basic oxygen steelmaking process
(BOF for short) or in some companies the
basic oxygen process (BOP for short).
The basic oxygen process consists essen-
tially of blowing oxygen of high purity onto
the surface of the bath in a basic lined ves-
sel by a water cooled vertical pipe or lance
inserted through the mouth of the vessel
(Fig. 1.3). 
A successful bottom blown oxygen steelmak-
ing process was developed in the 1970s.
Based on development in Germany and
Canada and known as the OBM process, or
Q-BOP in the United States, the new method
has eliminated the problem of rapid bottom
deterioration encountered in earlier attempts
to bottom blow with oxygen. The tuyeres

are designed in such a way that the stream of gaseous oxygen passing through a tuyere into the ves-
sel is surrounded by a sheath of another gas. The sheathing gas is normally a hydrocarbon gas such
as propane or natural gas. Vessel capacities of 200 tons and over, comparable to the capacities of typ-
ical top blown BOF vessels, are commonly used.
The desire to improve control of the oxygen pneumatic steelmaking process has led to the develop-
ment of various combination blowing processes. In these processes, 60–100% of the oxygen required
to refine the steel is blown through a top mounted lance (as in the conventional BOF) while additional
gas (such as oxygen, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or air) is blown through bottom mounted tuyeres
or permeable brick elements. The bottom blown gas results in improved mixing of the metal bath, the
degree of bath mixing increasing with increasing bottom gas flow rate. By varying the type and flow
rate of the bottom gas, both during and after the oxygen blow, specific metallurgical reactions can be
controlled to attain desired steel compositions and temperatures. There are, at present many different
combination blowing processes, which differ in the type of bottom gas used, the flow rates of bottom
gas that can be attained, and the equipment used to introduce the bottom gas into the furnace. All of
the processes, to some degree, have similar advantages. The existing combination blowing furnaces
are converted conventional BOF furnaces and range in capacity from about 60 tons to more than 300
tons. The conversion to combination blowing began in the late 1970s and has continued at an accel-
erated rate. Further details of these processes are given in Chapter 9.
Two other oxygen blown steelmaking, the Stora-Kaldo process and the Rotor process, did not gain
wide acceptance.
1.2.5 Electric Furnace Steelmaking
In the past twenty years there has been a significant growth in electric arc furnace (EAF) steel-
making. When oxygen steelmaking began replacing open hearth steelmaking excess scrap became
available at low cost because the BOF melts less scrap than an open hearth. Also for fully devel-
oped countries like the United States, Europe and Japan the amount of obsolete scrap in relation-
ship to the amount of steel required increased, again reducing the price of scrap relative to that of
hot metal produced from ore and coal. This economic opportunity arising from low cost scrap and
the lower capital cost of an EAF compared to integrated steel production lead to the growth of the
mini-mill or scrap based EAF producer. At first the mini-mills produced lower quality long prod-
ucts such as reinforcing bars and simple construction materials. However with the advent of thin
slab casting a second generation of EAF plants has developed which produce flat products. In the
decade of the 1990’s approximately 15–20 million tons of new EAF capacity has been built or
planned in North America alone. As discussed later and in Chapter 10 in detail, the EAF has evolved
and improved its efficiency tremendously. Large quantities of scrap substitutes such as direct
reduced iron and pig iron are now introduced in the EAF as well as large quantities of oxygen.
It has been said that arc-type furnaces had their beginning in the discovery of the carbon arc by Sir
Humphrey Davy in 1800, but it is more proper to say that their practical application began with
the work of Sir William Siemens, who in 1878 constructed, operated and patented furnaces oper-
ating on both the direct arc and indirect arc principles. 
At this early date, the availability of electric power was limited and its cost high; also, carbon elec-
trodes of the quality required to carry sufficient current for steel melting had not been developed.
Thus the development of the electric melting furnace awaited the expansion of the electric power
industry and improvement in carbon electrodes.
The first successful commercial EAF was a direct arc steelmaking furnace which was placed in
operation by Heroult in 1899. The Heroult patent stated in simple terms, covered single-phase or
multi-phase furnaces with the arcs in series through the metal bath. This type of furnace, utilizing
three phase power, has been the most successful of the electric furnaces in the production of steel.
The design and operation of modern electric arc furnaces are discussed in Chapter 10.
In the United States there were no developments along arc furnace lines until the first Heroult
furnace was installed in the plant of the Halcomb Steel Company, Syracuse New York, which

made its first heat on April 5, 1906. This was a single phase, two electrode, rectangular furnace
of 3.6 metric tons (4 net tons) capacity. Two years later a similar but smaller furnace was
installed at the Firth-Sterling Steel Company, McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and in 1909, a 13.5
metric ton (15 net ton) three phase furnace was installed in the South Works of the Illinois Steel
Company. The latter was, at that time, the largest electric steelmaking furnace in the world, and
was the first round (instead of rectangular) furnace. It operated on 25-cycle power at 2200 volts
and tapped its first heat on May 10, 1909.
From 1910 to 1980 nearly all the steelmaking EAFs built had three phase alternating current (AC)
systems. In the 1980s single electrode direct current (DC) systems demonstrated some advantages
over the conventional AC furnaces. In the past 15 years a large percentage of the new EAFs built
were DC. Commercial furnaces vary in size from 10 tons to over 300 tons. A typical state-of-the-
art furnace is 150–180 tons, has several natural gas burners, uses considerable oxygen (30m3/ton),
has eccentric bottom tapping and often is equipped with scrap preheating. A schematic of a typi-
cal AC furnace is shown in Fig. 1.5. The details concerning these furnaces and their advantages
are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Another type of electric melting furnace, used to a certain extent for melting high-grade alloys, is
the high frequency coreless induction furnace which gradually replaced the crucible process in the
production of complex, high quality alloys used as tool steels. It is used also for remelting scrap
from fine steels produced in arc furnaces, melting chrome-nickel alloys, and high manganese
scrap, and, more recently, has been applied to vacuum steelmaking processes.
The induction furnace had its inception abroad and first was patented by Ferranti in Italy in 1877.
This was a low frequency furnace. It had no commercial application until Kjellin installed and

operated one in Sweden. The first large installation of this type was made in 1914 at the plant of
the American Iron and Steel Company in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, but was not successful. Low fre-
quency furnaces have operated successfully, especially in making stainless steel.
A successful development using higher frequency current is the coreless high frequency
induction furnace. The first coreless induction furnaces were built and installed by the Ajax
Electrothermic Corporation, who also initiated the original researches by E.F. Northrup lead-
ing to the development of the furnace. For this reason, the furnace is often referred to as the
Ajax-Northrup furnace.
The first coreless induction furnaces for the production of steel on a commercial scale were
installed at Sheffield, England, and began the regular production of steel in October, 1927. The
first commercial steel furnaces of this type in the United States were installed by the Heppenstall
Forge and Knife Company, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and were producing steel regularly in
November, 1928. Each furnace had a capacity of 272 kilograms (600 pounds) and was served by
a 150 kVA motor-generator set transforming 60 hertz current to 860 hertz.
Electric furnace steelmaking has improved significantly in the past twenty years. The tap to tap
time, or time required to produce steel, has decreased from about 200 minutes to as little as 55
minutes, electrical consumption has decreased from over 600 kWh per ton to less than 400 and
electrical consumption has been reduced by 70%. These have been the result of a large number of
technical developments including ultra high power furnaces, long arc practices using foamy slags,
the increased use of oxygen and secondary refining. With new EAF plants using scrap alternatives
to supplement the scrap charge and the production of higher quality steels, EAF production may
exceed 50% in the United States and 40% in Europe and Japan by the year 2010.
Electric furnaces of other various types have been used in the production of steel. These include
vacuum arc remelting furnaces (VAR), iron smelting furnaces and on an experimental basis
plasma type melting and reheating furnaces. Where appropriate these are discussed in detail in
this volume.
1.3 Evolution in Steelmaking by Process
The proportion of steel produced by the major processes for the United States and the World are
given in Fig. 1.6 and Fig. 1.7, respectively. The relative proportions differ widely from country to
country depending on local conditions and when the industry was built.

For the United States in 1955 nearly 90% of the steel produced was in by the basic open hearth
processes. The last new open hearth shop was opened in 1958, approximately three years after the first
BOF. Starting in about 1960 the BOF began to replace the BOH. By 1975 BOF production reached
about 62% of the total. The remaining open hearth plants were either completely abandoned or con-
verted to EAF plants. The last open hearth in the United States at Geneva Steel was closed in 1991.
Also as the BOF melts less scrap than the BOH, electric furnace production grew because of the sur-
plus and relatively low cost of scrap. For most of the period from 1970 to 1990 scrap costs were sig-
nificantly lower than the cost of producing hot metal. Due to the increased price of scrap costs and more
efficient blast furnace operation, in the past few years the costs of hot metal and scrap have become
similar. Nevertheless electric furnace production continues to grow in the United States increasing by
over 15 million tons of production in the the 1990s.
World production has followed a generally similar trend, however, the patterns in different regions
vary greatly. For Japan and more recently Korea and Brazil, where the steel industry was built or
completely rebuilt after 1955, the BOF was the dominant process earlier. In other regions such as
the CIS (former Soviet Union), Eastern Europe and India open hearths were extensively used
through the 1980s. The choice of steelmaking process will continue to depend on local conditions
but a gradual growth in EAF production will continue. Much of the new production will be in
smaller developing countries and the scrap will be supplemented with other forms of iron includ-
ing direct reduced iron and pig iron.
In general the EAF share of production worldwide will continue to grow. However scrap alone can
never supply all of the iron requirements. For at least 30 years the blast furnace-BOF steelmaking
route will be required. In 20 to 30 years, the scrap/DRI-EAF share of production may grow to 50%
worldwide.
In the future the BOF and EAF processes will continue to evolve. In particular more gaseous oxygen
will be used in the EAF reducing electric energy consumption and be operated more as a hybrid
process between the BOF and EAF. Processes other than the BOF and EAF, which are discussed
in Chapter 13 may be commercialized. However even by 2010 or 2020 it is doubtful any will be
significant and attain 10% of total production.

1.4 Structure of This Volume
Following this introductory chapter, a major chapter on the fundamentals of iron and steelmaking
are given in Chapter 2, including the basic thermodynamics and kinetics along with reference data
on metal and slag systems. The next four chapters deal with the production and use of major mate-
rials for steelmaking such as refractories, industrial gases and fuels and utilities.
The first refining operations in steelmaking are hot metal treatments, which are described in
Chapter 7. This is followed by oxygen steelmaking, discussed in Chapters 8 and 9. In this edition,
the electric furnace chapter (Chapter 10) has been greatly expanded to reflect the advances in this
process in the last decade. Ladle and other secondary refining processes, including the AOD for
stainless steel production, are dealt with in Chapters 11 and 12. Finally, other and developing
future steelmaking processes are examined in Chapter 13.

There have been tremendous improvements in iron and steelmaking processes in the past twenty years.
Productivity and coke rates in the blast furnace and the ability to refine steel to demanding specifica-
tions have been improved significantly. Much of this improvement is based on the application of fun-
damental principles and thermodynamic and kinetic parameters which have been determined.
Whereas, many future improvements will be forthcoming in steelmaking equipment, process improve-
ments resulting from the application of fundamental principles and data will likewise continue.
In this chapter the basic principles of thermodynamics and kinetics are reviewed and the relevant
thermodynamic data and properties of gases, metals and slags relevant to iron and steelmaking are
presented. These principles and data are then applied to ironmaking, steelmaking and secondary
refining processes. These principles and data are also used in subsequent chapters in this volume.
In writing this chapter, an attempt has been made to limit the discussion to an average level suit-
able for the students of metallurgy pursuing graduate or post-graduate education as well as for
those with some scientific background engaged in the iron and steel industry. It is assumed that the
reader has some basic knowledge of chemistry, physics and mathematics, so that the chapter can
be devoted solely to the discussion of the chemistry of the processes.
2.1 Thermodynamics
2.1.1 Ideal Gas
A gas which obeys the simple gas laws is called an ideal gas satisfying the following relation:
PV=nRT
(2.1.1)
where n is the number of mols and R the universal molar gas constant.
For one mol of an ideal gas at 273.16K and l atm pressure, the value of the molar gas constant is:

In a gas mixture containing n1, n2, n3... number of mols of gases occupying a volume V at a total
pressure P, the partial pressures of the constituent gaseous species are as given below. 
(2.1.2)
P = p1 + p2 + p3 + ...
(2.1.3)
The following equations are for a given mass of gas at constant pressure, volume and temperature:
Constant pressure (isobaric)
(2.1.4)
Constant volume (isochoric)
(2.1.5)
Constant temperature (isothermal)
P1V1 = P2V2 = P3V3...
(2.1.6)
Generally speaking, deviation from the ideal gas equation becomes noticeable with easily liquefi-
able gases and at low temperatures and high pressures. The behavior of gases becomes more ideal
with decreasing pressure and increasing temperature. The nonideality of gases, the extent of which
depends on the nature of the gas, temperature and pressure, is attributed to two major causes: (1)
van der Waals’ forces and (2) chemical interaction between the different species of gas molecules or
atoms.
2.1.2 Thermodynamic Laws
2.1.2.1 The First Law
The first law of thermodynamics is based on the concept of conservation of energy. When there is
interaction between systems, the gain of energy of one of the systems is equal to the loss of the
other system. For example, the quantity of heat required to decompose a compound into its ele-
ments is equal to the heat generated when that compound is formed from its elements.
2.1.2.1.1 Enthalpy (heat content)
The internal energy of a system includes all forms of energy other
than the kinetic energy. Any exchange of energy between a system and its surroundings, resulting
from a change of state, is manifested as heat and work.
When a system expands against a constant external pressure P, resulting in an increase of volume
DV, the work done by the system is
w = PDV = P(VB – VA)
Since this work is done by the system against the surroundings, the system absorbs a quantity of
heat q and the energy E of the system increases in passing from state A to state B.
DE = EB – EA = q – PDV = q – P(VB – VA)
Upon re-arranging this equation, we have
(EB + PVB) – (EA + PVA) = q
The quantity E + PV is represented by a single symbol H, thus
DH = q = (EB + PVB) – (EA + PVA)
(2.1.7)
The function H is known as enthalpy or heat content.
There are two fundamental thermochemical laws which express the first law specifically in terms of
enthalpy. The first principle derived by Lavoisier and Laplace (1780) states that “the quantity of heat
required to decompose a compound into its elements is equal to the heat evolved when that com-
pound is formed from its elements”; i.e. the heat of decomposition of a compound is numerically

equal to its heat of formation, but of opposite sign. The second principle is that discovered by Hess
(1840); it states that “the heat of reaction depends only on the initial and final states, and not on the
intermediate states through which the system may pass.”
2.1.2.1.2  Heat Capacity
The heat capacity of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to
raise the temperature by one degree. The heat capacity of 1 g of a substance is called the specific
heat. The heat capacity of 1 g-molecule (abbreviated as mol) is called the molar heat capacity.
The variation of energy, at constant volume, and of enthalpy, at constant pressure, with tempera-
ture gives the heat capacity of the system, thus
(2.1.8)
(2.1.9)
For an ideal gas the difference between the molar heat capacities at constant pressure, Cp, and con-
stant volume, CV, is equal to the molar gas constant.
Cp – CV = R
(2.1.10)
Because of experimental convenience, the heat capacity is determined under conditions of constant
pressure (usually atmospheric).
From the temperature dependence of heat capacity at constant pressure, the enthalpy change is
obtained by integrating equation 2.1.9.
(2.1.11)
Above 298 K, the temperature dependence of Cp is represented by:
Cp = a + bT – cT–2
(2.1.12)
(2.1.13)
where the coefficients, a, b and c are derived from Cp calorimetric measurements at different tem-
peratures.
In recent compilations of thermochemical data, the H values are tabulated at 100 K intervals for
the convenience of users.
2.1.2.1.3 Standard State
The enthalpy is an extensive property of the system, and only the change
in heat content with change of state can be measured. A standard reference state is chosen for
each element so that any change in the heat content of the element is referred to its standard
state, and this change is denoted by DH°.
The natural state of elements at 25°C and 1 atm pressure is by convention taken to be the reference
state. On this definition, the elements in their standard states have zero heat contents.
The heat of formation of a compound is the heat absorbed or evolved in the formation of 1 g-mol
of the compound from its constituent elements in their standard states, denoted by DH°298.
2.1.2.1.4 Enthalpy of Reaction
The change of enthalpy accompanying a reaction is given by the dif-
ference between the enthalpies of the products and those of the reactants.

For an isobaric and isothermal reaction,
A + B = C + D
(2.1.14)
the enthalpy change is given by:
DH = (DH°C + DH°D) – (DH°A + DH°B)
(2.1.15)
By convention, H is positive (+) for endothermic reactions, i.e. heat absorption, and H is negative 
(–) for exothermic reactions, i.e. heat evolution.

2.1.2.1.5  Adiabatic Reactions
When a reaction occurs in a thermally insulated system, i.e. no heat
exchange between the system and its surroundings, the temperature of the system will change in
accordance with the heat of reaction.
As an example, let us consider the internal oxidation of unpassivated direct reduced iron (DRI) in
a stockpile, initially at 25°C. The enthalpy of reaction at 298K is
(2.1.18)
The heat balance calculation is made for 1000 kg Fe in the stockpile with 150 kg FeO formed in
oxidation. The heat absorbed by the stockpile is 150 ´ 103/72 ´ 267 kJ and the temperature rise is
calculated as follows:
Q
=
[nFe(Cp)Fe + nFeO (Cp)FeO](T - 298)
nFe
=
17,905 g-mol for 1000 kg Fe
nFeO
=
2087.7 g-mol for 150 kg FeO
Cp (Fe)
=
0.042 kJ mol–1K–1
Cp (FeO)
=
0.059 kJ mol–1K–1
\Q = 557,416 = (752 + 123) (T - 298)
With this adiabatic reaction, the stockpile temperature increases to T = 935K (662°C).
The moisture in the stockpile will react with iron and generate H2 which will ignite at the elevated
stockpile temperature. This has been known to happen when DRI briquettes were not adequately
passivated against oxidation.
2.1.2.2  The Second Law
The law of dissipation of energy states that all natural processes occurring without external inter-
ference are spontaneous (irreversible processes). For example, heat conduction from a hot to a cold

part of the system. The spontaneous processes cannot be reversed without some change in the sys-
tem brought about by external interference.
2.1.2.2.1  Entropy
The degree of degradation of energy accompanying spontaneous, hence irreversible,
processes depends on the magnitude of heat generation at temperature T and temperatures between
which there is heat flow.
The quantity q/T is a measure of degree of irreversibility of the process, the higher the quantity
q/T, the greater the irreversibility of the process. The quantity q/T is called the increase in entropy.
In a complete cycle of all reversible processes the sum of the quantities Sq/T is zero.
The thermodynamic quantity, entropy S, is defined such that for any reversible process taking place
isothermally at constant pressure, the change in entropy is given by 
(2.1.19)
2.1.2.3  The Third Law
The heat theorem put forward by Nernst (1906) constitutes the third law of thermodynamics: ‘the
entropy of any homogeneous and ordered crystalline substance, which is in complete internal equi-
librium, is zero at the absolute zero temperature.’ Therefore, the integral of equation given above
has a finite value at temperature T as shown below.
(2.1.20)
The entropy of reaction is
DS =SS(products) – SS(reactants)
(2.1.21)
and the entropy of fusion at the melting point Tm is
(2.1.22)
2.1.2.4 Gibbs Free Energy
From a combined form of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, Gibbs derived the free
energy equation for a reversible process at constant pressure and temperature.
G = H – TS
(2.1.23)
The Gibbs free energy is also known as the chemical potential.
When a system changes isobarically and isothermally from state A to state B, the change in the free
energy is
GB – GA = DG = DH – TDS
(2.1.24)
During any process which proceeds spontaneously at constant pressure and temperature, the free
energy of the system decreases. That is, the reaction is thermodynamically possible when DG < 0.
However, the reaction may not proceed at a perceptible rate at lower tempertures, if the activation
energy required to overcome the resistance to reaction is too high. If DG > 0, the reaction will not
take place spontaneously.
As in the case of enthalpy, the free energy is a relative thermodynamic property with respect to the
standard state, denoted by DG°.
The variation of the standard free energy change with temperature is given by:

2.1.2.4.1 Generalization of Entropy Change of Reaction
1.
When there is volume expansion accompanying a reaction, i.e. gas evolution, at con-
stant pressure and temperature the entropy change is positive, hence, DG decreases
with an increasing temperature.
C + CO2 = 2CO
DG° = 166,560 – 171.0TJ
(2.1.26)
2. When there is volume contraction, i.e. gas consumed in the reaction, at constant pres-
sure and temperature the entropy change is negative, hence DG increases with an
increasing temperature.
H2 + 1⁄2S2 = H2S
DG° = –91,600 + 50.6TJ
(2.1.27)
3. When there is little or no volume change the entropy change is close to zero, hence
temperature has little effect on DG.
C + O2 = CO2
DG° = 395,300 – 0.5TJ
(2.1.28)
2.1.2.4.2  Selected Free Energy Data
For many reactions, the temperature dependence of DH° and DS°
are similar and tend to cancel each other, thus the nonlinearity of the variation of DG° with the tem-
perature is minimized. Using the average values of DH° and DS°, the free energy equation is sim-
plified to
DG° = DH° – DS°T
(2.1.29)
The standard free energies of reactions encountered in ferrous metallurgical processes can be com-
puted using the free energy data listed in Table 2.1.
2.1.3  Thermodynamic Activity
The combined statement of the first and second laws for a system doing work only against pres-
sure gives the following thermodynamic relation.
dG = VdP – SdT
(2.1.30)
At constant temperature G = VdP and for 1 mol of an ideal gas V = RT/P; with these substituted
in equation (2.1.30) we obtain
(2.1.31)
Similarly, for a gas mixture
dGi = RT d(ln pi)
(2.1.32)
where pi is the partial pressure of the ith species in the gas mixture, and Gi partial molar free energy.
In a homogeneous liquid or solid solution, the thermodynamic activity of the dissolved element is
defined by the ratio
(2.1.33)
In terms of solute activity, the partial molar free energy equation is
dGi = RT d(ln ai)
(2.1.34)
Integration at constant temperature gives the relative partial molar free energy in solution
Gi = RT ln ai

(2.1.38)
2.1.3.1 Solutions
A solution is a homogeneous gas, liquid or solid mixture, any portion of which has the same
state properties. The composition of gas solution is usually given in terms of partial pressures
of species in equilibrium with one another under given conditions. For liquid solutions, as liq-
uid metal and slag, the composition is given in terms of the molar concentrations of compo-
nents of the solution.
The atom or mol fraction of the component i in solution is given by the ratio
where ni is the number of g-atoms or mols of component i per unit mass of solution, and n the total
number of g-atoms or mols. Since the metal and slag compositions are reported in mass percent,
ni per 100g of the substance is given by the ratio
where M i is the atomic or molecular mass of the component i.
Noting that the atomic mass of iron is 55.85g, the atom fraction of solute i in low alloy steels is
given by a simplified equation
(2.1.39)
In low alloy steelmaking, the composition of slag varies within a relatively narrow range, and the
total number of g-mol of oxides per 100g of slag is within the range Sn = 1.6 ± 0.1. With this sim-
plification, the mol fraction of the oxide in the slag is given by
(2.1.40)
2.1.3.1.1 Ideal Solutions – Raoult’s Law:
The solutions are said to be ideal, if the activity is equal to
the mol or atom fraction of the component i in solution,
ai = Ni
(2.1.41)
A thermodynamic consequence of Raoult’s law is that the enthalpy of mixing for an ideal solution,
HM,id, is zero. Substituting a i = Ni and HM,id = 0 in the free energy equation gives for the entropy
of formation of an ideal solution.

2.1.3.1.2 Nonideal Solutions
Almost all metallic solutions and slags exhibit nonideal behavior.
Depending on the chemical nature of the elements constituting a solution, the activity vs com-
position relation deviates from Raoult’s law to varying degrees, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.1 for
liquid Fe–Si and Fe–Cu systems at 1600°C.
2.1.3.2 Activity Coefficient
The activity coefficient of solute i is defined by the ratio
(2.1.43)
If the activity is relative to the pure component i, it
follows from Raoult’s law that as Ni®1, g®1.
2.1.3.2.1  Henry’s Law for Dilute Solutions In infinitely
dilute solutions, the activity is proportional to the
concentration
ai = gi
°Ni
(2.1.44)
The approach to Henry’s law at dilute solutions is
demonstrated in Fig. 2.2 for the activity of carbon
(relative to graphite) in austenite at 1000°C. The
austenite containing 1.65%C (NC = 0.072) is satu-
rated with graphite at 1000°C for which the carbon
activity is one relative to graphite.
Since Henry’s Law is valid at infinite dilution only,
the ration gi/gi
° is used as a measure of departure
from Henry’s Law for finite solute contents in
dilute solutions. For solute concentration in terms
of mass percent, Henry’s activity coefficient is
defined by the ratio

2.1.3.2.2  Interaction Coefficients
Over several mass percentages of the solute, the composition
dependence of activity coefficient fi of solute i in binary systems is represented by the following
relation in terms of mass %i.
log fi = ei
i[%i]
(2.1.46)
where e is called the solute interaction coefficient. For multi-component solutions, the following
summation is used
log fi = ei
i[%i] + Sei
j[%j]
(2.1.47)
where ei
j is the effect of the alloying element j on the activity coefficient of solute i.
2.1.3.3 Conversion from One Standard State to Another
In steelmaking processes we are concerned with reactions involving dissolved elements at low con-
centrations in liquid steel. Therefore, it is convenient to express the solute activity relative to Henry’s
law. The free energy change accompanying the isothermal transfer of solute from state A to state B is
(2.1.48)
Taking a pure component for state A, i.e. aA = 1 and Henry’s law for state B, i.e. a B = gi
°Ni
DG = RT ln(gi
°Ni)
(2.1.49)
For one mass percent solute in iron,
(2.1.50)
where Mi is the atomic mass (g) of the solute. Assuming that Henry’s law holds at 1 mass %, the
standard free energy of solution of pure component i in iron at 1 mass % is
(2.1.51)
Since Henry’s law is valid at infinite dilution only, appropriate correction must be made for non-
ideal behavior when using the above equation.
2.1.4  Reaction Equilibrium Constant
Let us consider the following reaction equilibrium occurring at constant temperature and pressure.
mM + nN = uU + vV
(2.1.52)
The state of equilibrium is defined by the following thermodynamic relation involving the activi-
ties of reactants M and N and the activities of the products U and V.
(2.1.53)
where the equilibrium constant K can be derived from the standard free energy change accompa-
nying the reaction thus,

Since DG° is a function of temperature only, the equilibrium constant is also a function of temper-
ature only.
(2.1.55)
In terms of enthalpy and entropy changes
(2.1.56)
In exothermic reactions DH is negative, therefore the equilibrium constant K decreases with an
increasing temperature. The temperature effect on K is the opposite in endothermic reactions.
For DG° in J, R = 8.314 J mol–1K–1 and substituting log for ln,
(2.1.57)
As an example, let us consider the following reaction equilibrium between liquid slag and low alloy
steel.
(MnO) + [C] = [Mn] + CO(g)
(2.1.58)
where the parenthesis ( ) and [ ] represent respectively the oxides dissolved in slag and elements
dissolved in iron. From the free energy data in Table 2.1 and those in Table 2.8 in section 2.4 for
the dissolution of graphite and liquid manganese in liquid iron, the standard free energy change
accompanying reaction 2.1.58 is
DG° = 230,560 – 147.32TJ
(2.1.59)
which gives for the equilibrium constant K
(2.1.60)
(2.1.61)
where pCO is in atm, the oxide activity is with respect to pure molten MnO and at low concentra-
tions, the mass percentages of Mn and C in the steel are essentially equivalent to their activities,
i.e. fMn and fC are close to unity.
For a steelmaking slag of basicity 3.0 containing 5% MnO, aMnO = 0.088; at 1600°C the equilib-
rium constant is K = 18.42 for which equation 2.1.61 gives for the slag-metal equilibrium
[%Mn]/[%C] = 1.62 at 1 atm pressure of CO.
2.2  Rate Phenomena
There are many different facets of rate phenomena involving homogeneous or heterogeneous
chemical reactions, mass transfer via atomic or molecular diffusional processes, viscous flow, ther-
mal and electrical conduction and so on. The concepts of diffusion, mass transfer and chemical
kinetics presented briefly in this section of Chapter 2, are confined to cases which are relevant to
the study of the rates of reactions in the iron and steelmaking processes.

The quantity of diffusing substance which passes per unit time through unit area of a plane per-
pendicular to the direction of diffusion, known as the flux J, is proportional to the concentration
gradient of the diffusing substance
(2.2.1)
The coefficient D is the diffusivity of the substance in the medium; C is the concentration of the
substance per unit volume and x the distance in the direction of diffusion.
The second law is for the nonsteady state diffusion.
The rate of accumulation of diffusing substance in a given volume element is the difference between
the inward and outward flux. In other words, what goes in and does not come out, stays there.
The rate of concentration change -dC/dt resulting from flux over a distance dx is
(2.2.2)
Hence, the change in flux with distance is
(2.2.3)
Invoking the first law and re-arranging gives the second law.
(2.2.4)
The solution of this equation depends on the geometry and on the boundary conditions of the
medium in which the dissolved substance is diffusing.
2.2.1.2  Chemical and Self-Diffusivities
There are two kinds of diffusivities:
(i) The chemical diffusivity is the coefficient of diffusion defined by Fick’s law
Di = -Ji(¶C/¶x) for the single diffusing species i.
(ii) The self-diffusivity is the coefficient of diffusion measured in a homogeneous
medium with the radioactive or stable isotope (tracer) of the diffusing species. The
self-diffusion is a consequence of random movements of atoms or molecules.
For an ideal solution, or an infinitely dilute solution, we have the equality
Di = Di
*
(2.2.5)
For nonideal solutions in general (ionic or metallic), Onsager and Fuoss1 derived the following
relation for the chemical diffusivity corrected for departure from ideal behavior.
(2.2.6)
where ai is the activity and gi the activity coefficient of the single diffusing species i.
2.2.1.3  Types of Diffusional Processes
There are various types of diffusional processes, depending on the medium in which the diffusion occurs.
2.2.1.3.1  Diffusion in Molten Slags and Glasses
Because of the ionic nature of the medium, the diffu-
sion in molten slags and glasses is by the ions. The ionic conduction is a purely random jump
process. For the limiting case of purely free and random movements of ions, the self-diffusivity of
the ionic species i is related to the electrical conductivity li by the Nernst-Einstein2 equation

where Zi is the valence and Ci the concentration (mol cm-3) of the species i and F = 96,489 C mol–1
the Faraday constant.
Reference may be made to a previous publication by Turkdogan3 on the review of interrelations
between ionic diffusion and conduction in molten slags.
2.2.1.3.2  Diffusion in Porous Media
The rate of a heterogeneous reaction between a gas and a porous
medium is much affected by the counter-diffusive flow of gaseous reactants and products through
the pores of the medium. There are two types of effective gas diffusivities, depending on the pore
structure of the medium:
(i) Molecular diffusivity in large pores and at ordinary to high pressures.
(ii) Knudsen diffusivity in small pores and at low pressures.
The pore diffusion is discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.
2.2.1.3.3  Eddy Diffusivity
The mass transfer occurring within a turbulent fluid flow is
characterized by the diffusion coefficient called eddy diffusivity which is a function of the
time-averaged and fluctuating velocity components in turbulent flow. This subject is covered in
detail in a text book on fluid phenomena by Szekely4.
2.2.2  Mass Transfer
In high temperature processes as in pyrometallurgy, the rates of interfacial chemical reactions
are in general much faster than the rates of transfer of the reactants and reaction products to and
from the reaction site. The formulations of rate equations for transport controlled reactions vary
considerably with the physical properties and type of fluid flow over the surface of the reacting
condensed phase. Then, there are formulations of rate equations for different regimes of gas
bubbles in liquid metal and slag. For a comprehensive discussion of the transport controlled
rate phenomena in metallurgical processes, reference may be made to textbooks by Szekely and
Themelis5 and by Geiger.6
There are numerous computer software packages, as for example PHOENICS, FLUENT, CFDS-
FLOWS3D, GENMIX, TEACH(2D, 3D), 2E/FIX, SOLA/VOF, METADEX(R) and FID, which are
used in the steel industry in the process and design engineering of plant facilities and in the con-
trol of steelmaking processes. References may also be made to the publications by Szekely et al.7-9
on the mathematical and physical modelling of metallurgical processes involving fluid flow, heat
transfer, mass transfer and gas-slag-metal reactions.
There are of course many other publications on this subject which cannot all be cited here as the
subject matter is well outside the scope of this book.
The rate phenomena discussed in this chapter are on chosen subjects which are pertinent to vari-
ous aspects of ferrous-pyrometallurgical processes, in addition to oxygen steelmaking, ladle refin-
ing and degassing.
2.2.2.1  Parabolic Rate of Oxidation of Iron
The scale forming in the oxidation of iron, or low alloy steels, consists of three layers of oxides:
wustite on the iron surface followed by magnetite then hematite on the outer surface of the scale.
From several experimental studies it was found that the average wustite:magnetite:hematite thick-
ness ratios were about 95:4:1. In iron oxides, the diffusivity of iron is greater than the oxygen
diffusivity. The rate of oxidation is controlled primarily by diffusion of iron through the wustite

the thin layers of magnetite and hematite.

where l is the parabolic rate constant, cm2 (scale) s–1
If the measurement of the rate of oxidation is made by the thermogravimetric method, then the par-
abolic rate constant kp would be in units of (gO)2cm–4s–1. From the compositions and densitites of
the oxides, with the relative thickness ratios of wustite:magnetite:hematite = 95:4:1, the values of
kp and l are related as follows.
kp (gO)2 cm–4 s–1 = 1.877l, cm2 (scale) s–1
(2.2.9)
Many experimental studies have been made of the rate of oxidation of iron in air and oxygen at
temperatures 600 to 1300°C. The temperature dependence of the parabolic rate constant is shown
in Fig. 2.3; the references to previous studies denoted by different symbols are given in a paper by
Sheasby et al.10
From theoretical considerations, Wagner11 derived the following equation for the parabolic rate
constant in terms of the activity of oxygen and self-diffusivities of the mobile species in the scale.
For the case of wustite with D*Fe >> D*O Wagner’s equation is simplified to

where a¢O and a²O are oxygen activities at the iron-wustite and wustite-magnetite interfaces, respec-
tively. The diffusion of iron ions in the nonstoichiometric phase wustite FeXO, is via the cation
vacant sites in the wustite lattice. It is for this reason that the self-diffusivity of iron increases with
an increasing O/Fe atom ratio in wustite, i.e. with increasing iron deficiency, as shown in Fig. 2.4
The values of kp = 1.877l calculated from the measured tracer diffusivity of iron using Wagner’s
equation, are consistent with the average experimental values in Fig. 2.3 which is represented by
the following equation.

2.2.2.2  Oxidation of Carbon in CO2–CO Mixtures
Most forms of carbon are porous, therefore the rate of oxidation, i.e. gasification of carbon, is deci-
sively affected by the pore structure, internal pore surface area, effective gas diffusivity in the pores
and particle size.
In a critical review of the oxidation of carbon, Walker et al.14 gave a detailed and a comprehensive
account of (up to 1959) experimental and theoretical studies on this subject. In the late 1960s, Turk-
dogan and co-workers15–17 pursued further experimental work on the oxidation of several types of
carbon in CO2–CO mixtures at temperatures up to 1300°C and at pressures of 0.01 to 10 atm. A
few salient features of their findings are briefly given here.

Depending on the particle size, pore structure, temperature and gas pressure, there is either com-
plete internal burning or external burning of carbon. The rate equations are of the following forms
for these two limiting cases:
(i) For small porous carbon particles and at low temperatures and pressures, there is rapid
counter current pore diffusion of CO2 and CO, and the rate of oxidation is controlled by
the chemical kinetics on the pore walls of the carbon. For this limiting case of complete
internal burning, the rate equation is
ln(1 – F) = –fSCit
(2.2.12)
where
F =
the mass fraction of carbon oxidized,
f =
specific isothermal rate constant of chemical reaction per unit area of the pore wall,
S =
connected internal pore surface area per unit mass cm2mol–1,
Ci
=
molar concentration of CO2 per cm3 in the gas stream,
t
=
oxidation time
(ii) For large carbon particles and at high temperatures and pressures, the gas diffusion is
confined to the pore mouths on the surface of the carbon particle. For this limiting
case of external burning the rate equation is
(2.2.13)
where 
De =
effective CO2–CO pore diffusivity,
r
=
molar bulk density of the carbon, 
ro =
initial radius of carbon particle.
The effects of the particle size and gas pressure on the rate of oxidation of electrode graphite is
shown in Fig. 2.5
A mathematical analysis was made by Tien and Turkdogan18 to formulate the pore diffusion effect
on partial internal burning of relatively large
carbon particles. The experimentally determined
initial rates of oxidation of coke and graphite
spheres (» 2 cm dia.) in 1:1 CO2:CO mixture at
1 atm pressure are compared in Fig. 2.6 with the

values calculated from the mathematical analysis, which is summarized in Fig. 2.7. In each dia-
gram, the lower curve is for 80% internal burning; therefore, in the region below this curve there
is almost complete pore diffusion. The upper curve is for 20% internal burning; therefore, in the
region above this curve, the pore diffusion control predominates.
Reference should also be made to a paper by Aderibigbe and Szekely19 for a more detailed math-
ematical formulation of the rate of pore-diffusion and reaction controlled gasification of metallur-
gical coke in CO2–CO mixtures.
2.2.2.3  Reduction of Iron Oxides
In view of its practical importance to the understanding and control of ironmaking processes, a
great deal of research has been done on the gaseous reduction of iron oxides and iron ores.
Because of the porous nature of iron oxides and the reduction products, the interpretation of the
reduction rate data is inherently complex.
The formation of product layers during the gaseous reduction of dense sintered hematite and magnetite
pellets or natural dense iron ore particles is a well-known phenomenon, as shown in Fig. 2.8.
In several studies made in the early 1960s20–22 it was found that the thickness of the reduced iron
layer, encasing the iron oxide core of the pellet, increased linearly with the reduction time. The mea-
sured rates were interpreted in terms of the rate-controlling chemical reaction at the iron wustite
interface; the diffusive fluxes of gases through the porous layers were assumed to be relatively fast.
On the other hand, Warner23 and Spitzer et al.24 have expressed the view that the rate of gaseous
reduction is much affected by the gaseous diffusional processes, e.g. the gas-film resistance at the

pellet surface and particularly the resistance to dif-
fusion in the porous product layers. The rate mea-
surements made by Turkdogan and Vinters25 on the
reduction of hematite pellets in H2–H2O and
CO–CO2 mixtures have clearly demonstrated that
the rate-controlling effects of gas diffusion into the
pores of the oxide granules or pellets and through
the porous iron layer dominate the reaction kinetics.
The sketch in Fig. 2.9 demonstrates three limiting
rate controlling processes as outlined below.
(a) With fine granules there is internal reduc-
tion producing rosettes or platelets of
metallic iron within the oxide particle; the
rate in terms of mass fraction reduced, F, is
independent of particle size.
(b) With large and dense oxide particles and
at high temperatures, the gas diffusion is
slow and the reaction is confined essen-
tially to pore mouths on the outer surface
of the particle, bringing about the devel-
opment of a porous iron layer around the
pellet. Because of the layer formation, this
mode of reduction is often called topo-
chemical reduction. In the early stages of 
reduction, the porous iron layer is sufficiently thin for rapid gas diffusion, therefore the
initial rate of reduction is controlled jointly by (i) gas diffusion into the pore mouths of
the oxide and (ii) reaction on the pore walls of the wustite.
(2.2.14)
(c) When the porous iron layer becomes sufficiently thick, the rate of reduction will be
controlled essentially by the counter current gas diffusion (H2–H2O and CO–CO2)
for which the limiting rate equation, for a given temperature is as follows.

where pi is the H2 or CO partial pressure in the gas stream and (pi)eq that for the iron-
wustite equilibrium and C a constant (a negative number) that takes account of all
early time departures from the assumed boundary conditions for this limiting case.
(d) At high reduction temperatures, with large oxide pellets and low velocity gas flows,
the rate of reduction is controlled primarily by mass transfer in the gas-film layer at
the pellet surface. In this limiting case the rate is inversely proportional to the
square of the particle diameter.
The experimental data are given Fig. 2.10 showing the particle size effect on the initial rate of
reduction of hematite granules or pellets in hydrogen.
When the thickness of the reduced porous iron layer exceeds 1 mm, the subsequent rate of reduc-
tion is controlled primarily by gas diffusion through the porous iron layer. The reduction data plot-
ted in accord with equation 2.2.15 usually give elongated S-shaped curves as in Fig. 2.11 for 15
mm diameter spheroidal hematite ore reduced in H2 at 1 atm. From about 50% to 95% or 99%
reduction, data are well represented by straight lines. The effective H2–H2O diffusivities in the
pores of the iron layer are derived from the slopes of the lines; details are given in Section 2.3.3.
The effect of reaction temperature on the pore surface area of iron and wustite formed by the reduc-
tion of hematite is shown in Fig. 2.12. The higher the reduction temperature, the smaller the inter-
nal pore surface area, i.e. the coarser the pore structure. The iron oxides reduced at temperatures
below 800°C are known to be pyrophoric, which is a consequence of a fine pore structure with a
large pore surface area as noted from the data in Fig. 2.12.

2.2.2.4  Mass Transfer with Gas Bubbles in Oxygen Steelmaking
In most practical applications of gas injection into liquids, we are concerned mainly with rates of
reactions in the swarm of bubbles. Mass-transfer phenomena in the swarm of bubbles have been
studied extensively with aqueous solutions; accumulated knowledge is well documented in a
review paper by Calderbank.26 Also, several studies have been made of the bubble size and veloc-
ity of rise of single bubbles in liquid metals. Szekely presented a comprehensive review of these
studies in his book on Fluid Flow Phenomena in Metals Processing.4
In his recent book Fundamentals of Steelmaking, Turkdogan27 made an assessment of the size
range of dispersed gas bubbles and the corresponding mass transfer in liquid steel for the condi-
tions prevailing in the BOF and Q-BOP steelmaking processes. In this assessment, the bubbles are
assumed to be generated from a multitude of points across the bottom of the vessel, as though the
entire vessel bottom were in fact one big porous plug.
2.2.2.4.1  Gas Holdup and Superficial Gas Velocity
The volume fraction of gas holdup (e) is given by
the following ratio:
(2.2.16)
where 
Vb
=
transitory bubble volume in the bath at any time,
Vs
=
steel volume in the vessel,
H
=
average bath depth,
A
=
average bath cross sectional area.
The velocity of bubble rise, Ub, in a swarm of bubbles is given by the ratio
(2.2.17)
where 
V
.
=
gas flow rate,
Us
=
superficial gas velocity.
In the studies of Calderbank and co-workers26 with the air-water system, the gas was injected into
the column of water through a sieve plate on the bottom of the column. The fractional holdup of
gas was reported as shown in Fig. 2.13. The units in F factor are Us, m s–1 and rg (the gas density),
kg m–3.
The dot-dash curve is taken to represent the average values. It appears that at F ³ 1, the gas holdup
reaches an essentially constant value of e = 0.6.
In the estimation of fractional gas holdup in the steel bath, during decarburization or argon stir-
ring, the gas flow rates taken are for the melt temperature and average gas bubble pressure. The
values used are for 1600°C and 1.5 atm so that V.

o(Nm3s–1); for these condi-
tions the gas densities are 0.27 kg m-3 for N2 and CO and 0.39 kg m-3 for Ar; an average value is
used, rg = 0.33 kg m–3.
The average bath cross sectional area A in BOF or Q-BOP vessel increases with an increasing
gas flow rate. Keeping in mind the inner dimensions of the BOF or Q-BOP vessel for 200-240
ton heats, the area values used are: A = 22 m2 at V.
T = 60 m3s–1 decreasing to A = 16 m2 at V.
T = 1
m3s–1. On this basis, the following equation is obtained for the superficial gas velocity Us as a
function of V.

The volume fraction gas holdup and bubble velocity of rise calculated using equation 2.2.18 and
Fig. 2.13 are plotted in Fig. 2.14 as a function of the gas flow rate. The gas holdup in the slag layer
is a more complex phenomenon, because of slag foaming and injection of large amounts of steel
droplets into the slag layer during decarburisation with oxygen blowing.
2.2.2.4.2  Estimation of Bubble Size for Uniformly Dispersed Bubbles in the Steel Bath
Many estimates
were made in the past of gas bubble diameters in steelmaking processes, the estimates varying over
a wide range from 1 to 8 cm or more. Bubbles with diameters >1cm acquire a spherical cap shape
as they rise in liquids. The apparent diameter is that of a sphere which has a volume equivalent to
that of the spherical cap shaped bubble.
Calderbank and co-workers26 and Leibson et al.28 have found that in aqueous solutions the bub-
ble size becomes smaller with an increasing gas flow rate, ultimately reaching a minimum size of
about 0.45 cm diameter at large gas flow rates. Relatively large gas bubbles in motion are subject
to deformation and ultimately to fragmentation into smaller bubbles. The drag force exerted by
the liquid on a moving bubble induces rotational and probably a turbulent motion of the gas within
the bubble.
This motion creates a dynamic pressure on the bubble surface; when this force exceeds the surface
tension, bubble breakup occurs. Because of the large difference between the densitites of the gas
and liquid, the energy associated with the drag force is much greater than the kinetic energy of the
gas bubble. Therefore, the gas velocity in the bubble will be similar to the bubble velocity. On the
basis of this theoretical reasoning, Levich29 derived the following equation for the critical bubble
size as a function of bubble velocity.

(2.2.19)
where s is the surface tension and Cd the drag coefficient, which is close to unity. As the bubble
size decreases with increasing bubble velocity, the gas circulation within the bubble diminishes,
thus becoming less effective in bubble fragmentation. Another view to be considered is that, as the
gas holdup increases with increasing gas flow rate, the liquid layer separating the bubbles becomes
thinner. Consequently, the dynamic gas pressure exerted on the bubble surface becomes nullified
by similar forces exerted in the neighboring bubbles, hence the cessation of bubble fragmentation
at high values of e.
The bubble fragmentation with increasing e, hence increasing Ub, is calculated for bubbles in water
with s = 0.072 Nm–1 and in liquid steel with (a) s = 1.7 Nm–1 in the presence of O < 4 ppm and 40
ppm S, and (b) s = 1.3 Nm-1 in the presence of 600 ppm O and 120 ppm S. The results are shown
in Fig. 2.15. As noted earlier, the limiting bubble size in air-water system is d = 0.45 cm which inter-
sects the fragmentation curve at e = 0.41, depicting the cessation of bubble fragmentation.
In an attempt to estimate the minimum bubble size in the swarm of bubbles in liquid steel, Turk-
dogan proposed the following hypothesis: ‘the surface energy of bubbles per unit mass of liquid
which the bubbles displace, are equal for all liquids.’ Thus, surface energy Eb of dispersed bubbles
of uniform size per unit mass of liquid which they displace is given by:

This conjectured statement leads to the following similarity relation for non-foaming inviscid liquids.
(2.2.21)
With s1 = 0.072 Jm-2 and d1 = 0.45 cm for gas-water system and s2 = 1.3 Jm–2 and r2 = 6940 kg m–3,
we obtain d2 = 1.16 cm for the limiting bubble diameter in liquid steel containing » 600 ppm O and
120 ppm S. For the melt containing O < 4 ppm and 40 ppm S, d2 = 1.52 cm. These limiting values
intersect the fragmentation curves for liquid steel at about e = 0.40, similar to that for water.
A uniform constant bubble size and essentially constant e = 0.6 at high gas flow-rates, means a con-
stant number of bubbles per unit volume of the emulsion. Noting that for the close-packed (fcc)
arrangement of bubbles, the packing fraction (gas holdup) is e = 0.74, the thickness of the liquid film
at the nearest approach of the bubbles is derived from the following equality of the bubble number.
(2.2.22)
Noting that for water the experimental data give d = 0.45 cm and that estimated for liquid steel
d = 1.16 cm, equation 2.2.22 gives d = 0.65 mm for bubbles in aqueous solutions and d = 1.68 for
bubbles in liquid steel at the limiting value of e = 0.6 for non-foaming inviscid liquids.
2.2.2.4.3  Rate Equation for Transport Controlled Gas Bubble Reactions in Liquid Steel
For mass-transfer
controlled reactions of gas bubbles in liquid steel, the rate equation has the following form:
(2.2.23)
where Xo and X e are the initial and gas-metal equilibrium concentrations of the diffusing reactant
in the melt, km the mass-transfer coefficient and So the bubble surface area which is in terms of e.

(2.2.24)
Bubble surface area with respect to unit mass of liquid is:
(2.2.24a)
From many studies of gas bubble reactions in nonfoaming aqueous solutions, the following for-
mulation have been derived for the liquid-phase mass-transfer coefficient for the regime of surface-
renewal at the gas-liquid interface.26
(2.2.25)
where D is the diffusivity of the reactant in the
liquid-film boundary layer.
In the presence of surface active solutes such as
oxygen and sulphur in liquid steel, the bubble sur-
face will be less mobile hence the rate constant km
will be somewhat less than that given by equation
2.2.25 for the mobile surface, which is a neces-
sary condition for surface-renewal. On the other
hand, the surface active solutes decrease the bub-
ble diameter, hence increase the bubble surface
area for a given gas holdup. It appears that the
product Sokm may not be too sensitive to the pres-
ence of surface active solutes in the liquid.
The rate constant Sokm for the transport controlled
reaction is obtained from the combination of equa-
tions 2.2.17, 2.2.24 and 2.2.25 as given below for
an average solute diffusivity D = 5 x 10–9 m2s–1.

bath for 220 + 20 ton heats.
2.2.2.4.4  Maximum Rate of Degassing of Liquid Steel with Argon Purging
If the rates of diffusional
processes and chemical reactions are sufficiently fast, the argon bubbles traversing the melt will be
saturated with N2 or H2 to the corresponding equilibrium values for the concentrations present in the
melt. It is for this limiting case that the following rate equation is applicable.

(2.2.33)
As discussed later in detail, the maximum rates are not observed in steelmaking processes; the rates
are limited by mass transfer and or chemical kenetics. Nevertheless equations 2.2.32 and 2.2.33
indicate, even for the limiting case, large quantities of purging gas are required and the processes
are normally not feasible.
2.2.3  Chemical Kinetics
The theory of the absolute reaction rates is based on the concept of the formation of an activated
complex as an intermediate transition state,
which has an infinitesimally short life time of
the order of 10–15 second. For an indepth study
of the theory of reaction kinetics, to which out-
standing contributions were made by Eyring
and co-workers, reference may be made to the
classical text books by Glasstone et al.30 and by
Hinshelwood.31
As illustrated in Fig. 2.17, there is a change in
energy profile accompanying the reaction that
involves the formation and decomposition of an
activated complex. While the change in free
energy accompanying reaction is DG° < 0, the
activation energy DG* > 0.
In almost all pyrometallurgical processes, we
are concerned with heterogeneous reactions
involving an interface between two reacting

phases, e.g. solid-gas, solid-liquid, liquid-gas and two immiscible liquids (slag-liquid metal). For the
case of a fast rate of transport of reactants and products to and from the reaction site, the rate is con-
trolled by a chemical reaction occurring in the adsorbed layer at the interface. The reaction between
adsorbed species L and M on the surface producing product Q occurs via the formation of an acti-
vated complex (LM)*.
(2.2.34)
The theory of the absolute rates states that the activated complex is in equilibrium with the reac-
tants for which the equilibrium constant K* for constant temperature is
(2.2.35)
where a’s are the thermodynamic activities.
Next to be considered is the specific rate of decomposition of the activated complex to the overall
reaction product Q, represented by

For single site occupancy by the activated complex in the adsorbed layer, the activity of the com-
plex is represented by
(2.2.37)
where q is the total fractional occupancy of the sites by the adsorbed species and j* is the activity
coefficient of the complex in the chemisorbed layer. Combining equations 2.2.35 - 2.2.37 gives the
rate of forward reaction in terms of the absolute reaction rate theory.
(2.2.38)
The thermodynamics of the chemisorbed layer at the interface, i.e. value of Go, K* and ,j are not
known, therefore the isothermal rate equation is given in a simplified general form thus
Rf = Ff (1 – q){a L a M}
(2.2.39)
where Ff is the isothermal rate constant of the forward reaction.
As the reaction progresses, concentrations of the reactants L and M decrease while the concentra-
tion of the product Q increases. Because of these composition changes and the influence of the
reverse reaction Q®L + M, the rate decreases with an increasing reaction time. The rate of the
reverse reaction is represented by
Rr = – Fr (1 – q){a Q}
(2.2.40)
where Fr is the rate constant of the reverse reaction. Therefore, the net overall rate of reaction is

(2.2.41)
When the rates of forward and reverse reactions are the same, i.e. dn/dt = 0, the reaction is said to
be at an equilibrium state. It follows that the ratio of the rate constants Ff/ Fr is the equilibrium
constant of the reaction.
(2.2.42)
In terms of a single rate constant, the net reaction rate is formulated as
(2.2.43)
where (a La M)eq is the equilibrium value for the activity aQ in stage II at any given reaction time.
For a given surface coverage, the temperature dependence of the rate constant is represented by
(2.2.44)
where Fo is a pre-exponential constant and
DH* is the apparent heat of activation for the
reaction at a given site fillage q.
Since the activation energy DG* is always
positive, the enthalpy of activation for the
reaction is also positive. As shown in Fig.
2.18 in the plot ln F vs 1/T the slope of the
line gives DH*. It should be noted that
since the thermodynamic quantities for the
activated complex (K*/j*) in the chemi-
sorbed layer are not known, the DH*
derived from the rate measurements over a
sufficiently large temperature range, is the
apparent heat of activation.
Another aspect of the kinetics of interfacial
reactions is the rate of chemisorption or des-
orption at the reaction surface as given by
the following theoretical equation for an
uncontaminated surface.
(2.2.45)
where Mi is the molecular mass of the adsorbed species. This equation is transformed to the fol-
lowing form for the maximum rate of vaporization, i.e. free vaporization, from an uncontaminated
surface at low pressures
(2.2.46)
where pi is the vapor pressure in atm, for which the equation is reduced to the following form.

2.2.3.1 Examples of Experiments on Rates of Interfacial Reactions
2.2.3.1.1 Nitrogen Transfer Across Iron Surface
The rate of reaction of gaseous nitrogen with liquid
and solid iron, in the presence of surface active alloying elements, has been studied by many inves-
tigators since the late 1950s. It was in the late 1960s32–34 that the rate controlling reaction mecha-
nism was resolved, which was further confirmed in the subsequent experimental work done by
Fruehan and Martonik35, Byrne and Belton36, and Glaws and Fruehan37.
In particular the latter investigators used an isotope exchange technique which measured the rate
of dissociation of the N2 molecule. They demonstrated the rate of dissociation was the same as the
rate of absorption of nitrogen, providing strong evidence that the absorption rate is controlled by
dissociation.
When the rate of reaction is not hindered by slow nitrogen transport to and from the gas-metal
interface, the rate of nitrogenation
N2 (g) = N2* ® 2[N]
(2.2.48)
is controlled either by the rate of chemisorption or dissociation of N2 molecules on the metal sur-
face. The rate of reverse reaction, i.e denitrogenation, is of course a second order type with respect
to nitrogen dissolved in the metal. The equation below represents the rate of nitrogen transfer from
gas to liquid iron
(2.2.49)
where r is the density of liquid iron, A the surface area of the melt on which the nitrogen stream
is impinging and V the volume of the melt. The rate constant Ff, in units of g N cm–2min–1atm–1N2,
is for the forward reaction 2.2.48. The equilibrium partial pressure (pN2)eq corresponding to the
nitrogen content of the melt at the reaction time t, is that given by the equilibrium constant K for
nitrogen solubility.
(2.2.50)
With this substitution the isothermal rate equation is
(2.2.51)
For constant N2 pressure and temperature, the integration of equation 2.2.51 gives for %N = 0 at
t = 0,
(2.2.52)
Byrne and Belton made an accurate determination of the rate constant Ff for reaction of N2 with
high purity iron and Fe-C alloys at 1550–1700°C, by measuring the rate of 15N®14N isotope
exchange that occurs on the iron surface, as represented by
(2.2.53)
where the rate constant Ff is in units of g N cm–2min–1atm–1. The apparent heat of activation =
121.4 kJ mol–1 is much lower than the value expected for the rate of dissociation of N2. As
pointed out by Byrne and Belton, the rate of chemisorption of N2 is presumably controlling the
reaction mechanism.

The surface active elements dissolved in iron, e.g. O, S, Se, Te, are known to lower the rate of
nitrogen transfer across the iron surface. On the basis of the experimental rate data with liquid
iron containing O and S, as given in various publications (Refs. 33–38) and the surface tension
data, the effects of O and S on the fraction of vacant sites, 1-q, in the chemisorbed layer may
be represented by
(2.2.54)
which is a slightly simplified form of the equation that was derived by Byrne and Belton.
For the chemical reaction-controlled nitrogen removal from liquid iron (or steel) in reduced pres-
sures or in an inert gas stream with very low N2 pressure
2[N] ® N2 (g)
(2.2.55)
the integrated form of the rate equation is
(2.2.56)
where %No is the initial nitrogen content and Fr the rate constant = Ff/K.
The solubility of N2 in liquid iron or low alloy steel is given by
(2.2.57)
Combining this with equation 2.2.53 gives for the rate constant Fr in gN cm–2min–1%N–1
(2.2.58)
Now let us consider the chemical-reaction controlled rate of denitrogenation. It will be assumed
that the rate is controlled by only chemical kinetics. In actuality it is controlled by mass transfer
and chemical kinetics in series which is discussed later in detail. From equation 2.2.58 the rate for
1600°C Fr = 0.233 g N cm-2s–1%N–1. For liquid steel containing 600 ppm O and 120 ppm S, (1 –
q) = 0.055 from equation 2.2.54. For the gas flow rate V
.
T = 34 m3s–1, e = 0.6 and the bubble sur-
face area is Sm = 1.11 cm2g-1 liquid steel. Inserting these numbers in equation 2.2.56 for the limit-
ing case of %Ne » 0, gives
(2.2.59)
In 60 seconds time of purging, 0.0030% No will be reduced only to 0.0024% N. In actual fact, the
argon bubbles traversing the melt will contain some N2; for example, if the nitrogen partial pres-
sure in gas bubbles were 0.001 atm N2, the equilibrium content in the melt would be 0.0015% Ne.
Therefore, with %Ne > 0, the nitrogen removal will be much less than that calculated above for the
chemical-reaction controlled rate for the hypothetical limiting case of %Ne » 0.
The foregoing predication from the rate equation is in complete accord with the practical experience that
even at high rates of argon purging of the melt, as in OBM(Q-BOP), there is no perceptible nitrogen
removal primarily because of the presence of surface active solutes, oxygen and sulfur, in the steel bath.
2.2.3.1.2 CO2 and H2O Reaction with Fe–C Melts

trolling reaction rates is the decarburization of Fe–C melts.

Sain and Belton39 and later Mannion and Fruehan40 showed that the rate was affected by surface
active elements and was consistent with CO2 dissociation on the surface controlling the rate.
Nagasaka and Fruehan41 measured the rate of decarburization by H2O.
H2O + C = CO + H2
(2.2.61)
They also found that the rate was controlled by chemical kinetics and most likely dissociation of H2O
on the surface. For both the CO2 and H2O reaction, the rate constant could be expressed by the rela-
tionship
(2.2.62)
where kC, kp and kr are the rate constants, kp is the rate constant for pure iron and kr is the residual
rate at high sulfur contents respectively and Ks is the absorption coefficient for sulfur on liquid iron.
The first term is based on the analysis by Belton42 and the residual rate which is relatively small is
discussed by Nagasaka et al in detail.41 The overall rate constants are given as a function of sulfur
content in Fig. 2.19.

2.2.3.1.3 Chemical Kinetics of Carbon Oxidation in CO2–CO Mixtures
Examples of the experimental data
on the initial rate of internal oxidation of granular (0.5 mm dia.) electrode graphite and metallur-
gical coke are given in Figs. 2.20 and 2.21, reproduced from a previous publication.16
In a subsequent publication, Turkdogan27 re-assessed the interpretation of the rate data on the
assumption that both CO and CO2 are chemisorbed on the pore walls of the carbon and the rate of
oxidation is due to the rate of dissociation of chemisorbed CO2. For the limiting case of complete
internal burning, the rate equation will be in the following form

where F¢ is the rate constant (min–1atm–1CO2) for a given temperature and a particular type of car-
bon; the constants k1 and k2 are associated with the chemisorption of CO and CO2. It should be
noted that in compliance with the notation in equation 2.2.64 for the ideal monolayer, the constants
k1 and k2 are reciprocals of the respective activity coefficients of the absorbed species, i.e. k1 =
1/jCO and k2 = 1/jCO2; the fraction of vacant sites being (1 - q ) = (1 - qCO - qCO2).
The fraction of surface sites qi covered by the adsorbed species is related to the solute activity as
given in the following Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
(2.2.64)
From the cited experimental data for the oxidation of graphite and coke the following equations are
obtained for the temperature dependence of F¢, j CO = 1/k1 and jCO2 = 1/k2.
For electrode graphite:
(2.2.65)
(2.2.66)
(2.2.67)
For metallurgical coke:
(2.2.68)
(2.2.69)
(2.2.70)
It should be noted that these equations fit the measured initial rates of oxidation within a factor of
about 1.5 for temperatures 800 to 1200°C and for CO2 pressures 0.03 to 3 atm. For easy compari-
son of the reactivities of electrode graphite and metallurgical coke, the numerical values are given
below from the above equations for 900 and 1200°C.

After about 3 to 5 percent of initial oxidation, the pore surface area of the coke samples were found
to be four to five times greater than the graphite samples; this is consistent with the F¢ values for
coke being greater than for graphite by a similar factor. The extent of CO adsorption on the pore
walls of electrode graphite or coke is greater than the CO2 adsorption.
There are variations in the reported values of the apparent heat of activation for oxidation of the
electrode (or reactor grade) graphite in CO2. For example, Gulbransen et al.43 found DH* = 368 kJ
mol-1 while according to Blackwood’s work 44 DH*= 260 kJ mol–1; in the present case DH* = 317 kJ
mol-1. Reference should be made also to the papers of Ergun,45 Hedden and Lowe,46 and by
Grabke47 for various other interpretations of the kinetics of oxidation of carbons.
Aderibigbe and Szekely48 also investigated the oxidation of metallurgical coke in CO2–CO mix-
tures at 850 to 1000°C. Their rate constants K1 (º F¢) are similar to those given by equation 2.2.68
their estimate of the apparent heat of activation being DH* = 249±47 kJ mol–1.

Recently Story and Fruehan49 examined the oxidation of carbons in CO–CO2 gas mixtures at high
temperatures (>1300°C) under conditions of high external mass transfer. The gas mixture was jet-
ted at high velocities, reducing the resistance to mass transfer at the surface. They were in limiting
case of external oxidation and determined the parameter (frS De) from the data, and then using
published values of S and computed values of De, computed the rate constant. The results are com-
pared to the rates measured at lower temperatures in Fig. 2.22.

2.2.4 Mixed Control
In many metallurgical operations the rate is not controlled by a single reaction step such as mass
transfer or chemical kinetics but rather two steps in series such as mass transfer followed by chem-
ical kinetics. By equating the fluxes for each of the reaction steps it is possible to obtain expres-
sions for the overall rate, or a series of expressions, which can be solved numerically.
2.2.4.1 Mixed Control for Gas Phase Mass Transfer and Chemical Kinetics
In general the temperature dependence of chemical kinetics is greater than for gas phase mass
transfer. Consequently at low temperatures chemical kinetics is predominantly controlling the rate
while at high temperatures mass transfer dominates. However for many reactions over a large range
of conditions including temperature, fluid flow conditions and the concentration of surface active
elements which effect the chemical rate, the rate is controlled by both processes in series.
For example, the rate of dissociation of CO2 and H2O on liquid iron is controlled by both gas phase
mass transfer and chemical kinetics in series over a large range of temperature and fluid flow con-
ditions. In this case the pressure of the reacting gas at the surface is not the bulk composition. The
flux of the reacting gas and the rate of the reaction are given by 2.2.71 and 2.2.72 respectively,

Equations 2.2.71 and 2.2.72 assume that the chemical rate is first order and the reaction is equil-
molar in terms of the moles of reactant and product gases or the pressure of the reaction gas is
low. As it is not possible to accumulate component i at the surface, the processes are assumed to
be at steady state and the flux and chemical rate are equated. It is then possible to calculate the
pressure at the surface and the rate in terms of the bulk composition. Further simplification gives
(2.2.73)
Equation 2.2.73 is analogous to an electrical current with two resistances in series where k and
mi/RT are analogous to conductivities. The first term in equation 2.2.73 is often referred to as the
observed or overall rate constant. 
For example Nagasaka and Fruehan41 measured the rate of dissociation of H2O on liquid Fe-C-S
alloys from 1673 to 1873°K for varying sulfur contents. At 1873K and 0.1% S the measured over-
all rate constant was 2.5´10–4 mole/cm2 s atm for conditions where the mass transfer coefficient
was 100 cm/s. For this case the chemical rate was computed to be 3.9´10-4 mole/cm2 s atm.
Similarly the nitrogen and carbon dioxide reactions can be controlled by gas phase mass transfer
and chemical kinetics and equations 2.2.71 – 2.2.73 can be applied.
2.2.4.2 Mixed Control for Chemical Kinetics and Liquid Phase Mass Transfer
For many conditions in steelmaking and refining the rate of pick up or removal of nitrogen from
liquid iron is controlled by chemical kinetics and liquid phase mass transfer in series. Fruehan,
Lally and Glaws50 developed a mixed control model and applied it to several metallurgical
processes. For nitrogen gas reacting with iron the flux of nitrogen for mass transfer and the chem-
ical reaction are given by 2.2.74 and 2.2.75.

Since no nitrogen can be accumulated at the surface it is possible to equate the two flux equa-
tions, 2.2.74 and 2.2.75, and solve for the nitrogen content at the surface. The equation is a qua-
dratic and is solved numerically for small time increments for specific conditions.. The surface
nitrogen content is then used to compute the rate of nitrogen absorption or removal. This tech-
nique was applied to nitrogen absorption into liquid iron when bubbling nitrogen in the ladle
and typical results are shown in Fig. 2.23. The rate of nitrogen pick up for low sulfur steel is
considerably faster than for high sulfur steel, as sulfur decreases the chemical rate. Below
0.005% S the rate does not increase further as liquid phase mass transfer then dominates and it
is not affected by sulfur content.

2.3.1.2 Equilibrium States in Gas Mixtures
When assessing the state of reactions involving gas mixtures, the partial pressures of the gaseous
species should be evaluated from the reaction equilibrium data for all the pertinent gas reactions. The
principle of the computation is demonstrated by the following example for the gas mixture
CO–CO2–H2O–CH4.
This example is in relation to reheating a reformed gas in the direct iron ore reduction processes.
If there is complete gas equilibrium at the reheating temperature and pressure, the activity of car-
bon in the equilibrated gas mixture must satisfy the following three basic reaction equilibria:
(2.3.1)
(2.3.2)
(2.3.3)
(2.3.4)
(2.3.5)
(2.3.6)
For the predominant gaseous species the following equalities are derived from the mass balance for
(SC), (SO) and (SH).

where i and e indicate partial pressures in the ingoing and equilibrated gas mixtures, respectively.
The equation below gives the total pressure P of the equilibrated gas mixture.
(pCO + pCO2 + pH2 + pH2O +pCH4)
e = P
(2.3.9)
The partial pressures of gaseous species and the activity of carbon in the equilibrated gas mixture
are computed by simultaneous solution of equations 2.3.1 to 2.3.9 with known values of the equi-
librium constants K1, K2, and K3.
Examples are given in Fig. 2.25 showing the calculated carbon activities for 4 atm total pressure
and for an initial gas mixture containing 73% H2, 18% CO, 8% CO2, 1% CH4 to which 0.2% to
6.0% H2O has been added. The carbon deposition is imminent when its activity in the equilibrated
gas exceeds unity, with respect to graphite. With the addition of 0.2% H2O to this gas mixture, there
should be no carbon deposition in the equilibrated gas mixture at temperatures below 512°C and
above 720°C. In an earlier study of the reduction of iron oxides in a similar gas mixture, carbon
deposition was observed at all temperatures below 1000°C (see Ref. 51), indicating lack of com-
plete gas equilibrium even at 1000°C. These experimental findings suggest that carbon deposition
may occur during reheating of reformed natural gas in industrial operations, even when the calcu-
lated carbon activity is less than unity in the gas mixture under equilibrium conditions.

The activity of carbon cannot be calculated for a
nonequilibrated gas mixture. However, for the
purpose of identifying the reactions that may be
responsible for carbon deposition, we may cal-
culate carbon activities for individual reactions
on the assumption that there is no change in the
composition of the inlet gas upon heating. As is
seen from the example given in Fig. 2.26 the car-
bon activities for individual reactions differ con-
siderably from those calculated for complete gas
equilibrium. For complete gas equilibrium, the
carbon activity is below unity at temperatures
below 540 and above 700°C, while for the indi-
vidual reactions the carbon activity is below
unity only within the temperature range
880–1060°C. Therefore, in the nonequilibrated
gas, there can be no carbon deposition only
within the temperature range 880–1060°C. The
temperature at which carbon deposition may
start depends on the relative rates of reactions
2.3.1 and 2.3.3: below 730°C if reaction 2.3.1 is
fast, and below 880°C if reaction 2.3.3 is fast.
On the basis of the foregoing reasoning, we may
compute a diagram of % H2O in the inlet
reformed gas versus temperature, as in Fig. 2.27, to delineate the regions where (I) carbon will not
deposit, (II) carbon may deposit, and (III) carbon will deposit. With increasing pressure, regions II and
III move to higher temperatures and I to higher concentrations of H2O, and chances of carbon deposi-
tion become greater. From the equilibrium constant for reaction 2.3.3, we can also compute the criti-
cal pH2O/pCO ratio for possible carbon deposition at any temperature and partial pressure of H2 in the
inlet gas. The possibility of carbon deposition in region II depends much on the catalytic behavior of
the inner surface of the reheater tubes.

2.3.1.3 Catalytic Decomposition of Carbon Monoxide
The catalytic decomposition of carbon monoxide has been the subject of much study, because of the
occurrence of carbon deposition in many processes, e.g., blast furnaces, the Stelling process, the Fis-
cher-Tropsch process, nuclear reactors, and so on. References to early work on this subject are listed
in an annotate bibliography by Donald53. The consensus is that iron, cobalt, and nickel are the most
effective catalysts for the decomposition of carbon monoxide. Kehrer and Leidheiser54 reported vir-
tually no catalytic effect of copper, silver, chromium, molybdenum, palladium, and rhenium.
In a comprehensive study of carbon deposition in CO–H2 mixtures at temperatures of 450–700°C,
Walker et al.55 observed that the C/H atom ratio in the deposit increased from 10 to 50 with increas-
ing reaction temperature and increasing CO/H2 ratio in the gas. They also found that the properties
of carbon deposit were affected by the amount accumulated on the catalyst, e.g., with increasing
thickness of the carbon layer, the crystallinity became poorer, the surface area increased, the elec-
trical conductivity decreased, and the C/H2 ratio increased. Another important finding was that car-
bon deposition ultimately ceased when most of the iron was converted to cementite. Upon
hydrogen treatment, cementite decomposed to iron and graphite, but the regenerated iron lost most
of its reactivity as a catalyst. Similar observations were made by Turkdogan and Vinters51 in sub-
sequent studies of the catalytic decomposition of carbon monoxide in the presence of porous iron.
It is generally agreed that iron, not cementite, catalyzes the decomposition of carbon monoxide. The
chemisorption of H2 and CO on the surface of iron is believed to approach equilibrium rapidly. The
carbon formed by reactions 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 migrates across the surface to a nucleating center where
cementite and free carbon are deposited. Based on x-ray diffraction and electron microscopic stud-
ies, Ruston et al.56 suggested that although the decomposition of carbon monoxide was catalyzed by
iron, an iron carbide Fe7C3 formed as an intermediate step in the decomposition of the activated
reaction product to graphite.

As is seen from the experimental results of Olsson and Turkdogan57 in Fig. 2.28, the rate of car-
bon deposition on an iron catalyst in CO–H2 mixtures is a complex function of temperature and
gas composition. From the measured rate of carbon deposition and the measured CO2/H2O in
the exhaust gas, the rates of reactions 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 were determined. These measured rates
are shown in Fig. 2.29 as a function of gas composition at 400, 600 and 800°C. The hydrogen
appears to have a dual role: at low concentrations the hydrogen catalyzes reaction 2.3.1, and at
high concentrations of hydrogen reaction 2.3.3 contributes directly to carbon deposition.

Although H2O is expected to retard or inhibit carbon deposition by virtue of reverse reaction
2.3.4, it has been found57 that an addition of 0.5%–2% H2O to CO–CO2 mixtures enhances the
rate of carbon deposition at 400–600°C. A similar catalytic effect of H2O has been observed for
carbon deposition from methane in the presence of nickel58. We might mention in passing that
the rate of carbon formation by the disproportionation of carbon monoxide is much faster than
the pyrolysis of methane under similar conditions.59 Ever since the first observations made by
Byrom60 and soon after by Carpenter and Smith61, it has become generally recognized that sul-
fur in the gas retards or inhibits the catalytic action of iron in the decomposition of carbon
monoxide. This is due to the coating of iron surface with cementite, which does not decompose
readily in the presence of sulfur. In fact, in the Stelling process62 the iron ore is reduced to
cementite in a CO–CO2 atmosphere without the formation of free carbon, probably because of
the presence of sulfur in the system.
The nitrogen-bearing gaseous species such as NH3 and (CN)2 are also known to retard the decom-
position of carbon monoxide.62–63 Again, this may be attributed to extended metastability of cemen-
tite in the presence of nitrogen. The retarding effect of sulfur and nitrogen on carbon deposition is
similar to sluggish graphitization of steel (by decomposition of cementite) in the presence of sul-
fur and nitrogen in solution in steel.

The carburization of iron in gas mixtures containing H2 and CO following reactions similar to 2.3.1
and 2.3.3 occurs on iron surfaces. These reactions are relevant to the early stages of metal dusting
and were studied by Fruehan and Martonik.64 They also found that the rate of reaction 2.3.3 is
faster than 2.3.1 and contributes significantly to the carburization of iron64 as shown in Fig.2.30.
When CO is replaced by H2 the rate increases significantly. The H2–CO reaction rate constant is
approximately tenfold greater than that for CO for carburization.
2.3.2 Transport Properties
The molecular transfer of mass, momentum and energy are interrelated transport processes of dif-
fusion under a concentration gradient, viscous flow in a velocity gradient and heat conduction in a
thermal gradient.
The derivation of the transport properties from the rigorous kinetic theory of gases, described in
depth by Chapman and Cowling65 and Hirschfelder et al.66 is based on the evaluation of the inter-
molecular energy of attraction, the collision diameter and the collision integral involving the
dynamics of a molecular encounter, hence the intermolecular force law.
For a brief description of the theoretical equations for the calculation of the transport properties of
gases, reference may be made to a previous publication.52 For the present purpose, it is sufficient
to give selected numerical data on the transport properties of a few gases, relevant to ironmaking
and steelmaking processes.

For polyatomic gases,
(2.3.11)
where CV is the molar heat capacity at constant volume and
is the Eucken67 correction factor for thermal conductivity of polyatomic gases.
For monatomic gases CV = 3R/2; with this substitution, equation 2.3.11 is reduced to equation
2.3.10. In terms of the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, CV = Cp - R, equation 2.3.11 is
transformed to the following form.

2.3.2.1.2 Thermal Diffusivity/Thermal Conductivity
The thermal diffusivity, DT, is analogous to mass
diffusivity and is given by the ratio
(2.3.13)
where r is the molar density of the gas.

2.3.3 Pore Diffusion
When the pores are small enough such that the mean free path of the molecules is comparable to
the dimensions of the pore, diffusion occurs via the collision of molecules with the pore walls.
Knudsen68 showed that the flux involving collision of molecules with reflection from the surface
of the capillary wall is represented by the equation
(2.3.20)
where v– is the mean thermal molecular velocity = (8kT/pm)1/2, r the radius of capillary tube and
dC/dx the concentration gradient along the capillary. For r in cm and the Knudsen diffusivity DK

The Knudsen diffusivity being independent of pressure but molecular diffusivity inversely propor-
tional to pressure, it follows that in any porous medium, the Knudsen diffusion predominates at low
pressures where the mean free path is larger than the dimensions of the pore.
For the mixed region of molecular and Knudsen diffusion in capillaries, Bosanquet69 derived the
following expression based on the random walk model in which the successive movements of mol-
ecules are terminated by collision with the capillary wall or with other molecules:
(2.3.22)
where Dii is the molecular self-diffusivity. For a porous medium of uniform pore structure with
pores of equal size, the Bosanquet interpretation formula gives for the effective diffusivity of com-
ponent i
(2.3.23)
where e is the volume fraction of connected pores, t the tortuosity factor, D12 the molecular diffu-
sivity for a binary mixture 1–2 and Dki the Knudsen diffusivity of component i for a given uniform
pore radius r.
2.3.3.1 Examples of Experimental Data
The experimental data are shown in Fig. 2.31 for effective diffusivity He–CO2 at 20°C. As dis-
cussed in Section 2.2.2.3 the pore structure of iron becomes finer at a lower reduction temperature.
It is for this reason that the Knudsen diffusion effect at lower pressures becomes more pronounced
for porous iron reduced at 800°C as compared to that reduced at 1000°C. More detailed informa-
tion is given in the previous publications on the subject of gas diffusion in porous media.51, 70

It is seen from the data in Fig. 2.32 that the effective diffusivities for H2–H2O measured directly or
calculated from the pore structure considerations, agree well with those derived from the rate mea-
surements within the regime of pore-diffusion control, i.e. from the slopes of the lines in Fig. 2.11.
The temperature has a small effect on gas diffusivities. A marked effect of temperature on the effec-
tive diffusivity seen in Fig. 2.32 is due mainly to the coarseness of the pore structure of iron when
the oxide is reduced at higher temperatures.

In the case of internal burning of carbon, the pore structure becomes coarser as the gasification pro-
gresses, resulting in an increase in the effective gas diffusivity. A few examples of the measured
CO–CO2 effective diffusivities for electrode graphite are given in Table 2.5, reproduced from Ref. 17.

Recently Story and Fruehan49 demonstrated the effect of Knudsen diffusion in the oxidation of car-
bon in CO2–Ar and CO2–He gas mixtures. Normally one would expect the rate to be significantly
faster in CO2–He and CO2–Ar due to their higher molecular diffusivities. In general the diffusiv-
ity is given by 2.3.22. Knudsen diffusion is important when the pore diameter is smaller than the
mean free path of the molecules, where the molecules strike the pore walls and diffusivity does not
depend on the molecule size. For ultra pure graphite the overall rate constant for external oxida-
tion, (SDe) as discussed in Section 2.2.2.2, was the same for CO2–He and CO2–Ar gas mixtures.
For this particular material the pore size was small and Knudsen diffusion predominates. On the
other hand for coke with large pores the rate is significantly faster with He as the dilution gas as
the pores are large and molecular diffusion dominates.
2.4 Properties of Molten Steel
2.4.1 Selected Thermodynamic Data
The thermodynamic properties of liquid iron alloys have been studied extensively, both experi-
mentally and theoretically. Most of these studies were made over a period from 1950 through 1970.
For the present purpose, only a selected set of activity data need to be considered, in relation to the
study and understanding of the chemistry of iron and steelmaking reactions.
2.4.1.1 Solute Activity Coefficients
For low solute contents, as in low-alloy steels, the activity is defined with respect to Henry’s law
and mass percent of the solute
ai = fix[%i]
(2.4.1)
such that fi®1.0 as [%i]®0.
Up to several percent of the solute content, log f i increases or decreases linearly with an increas-
ing solute concentration.
log fi = ei[%i]
(2.4.2)
The proportionality factor ei is known as the interaction coefficient.
The binary interaction coefficients ei
i for dilute solutions in liquid iron are listed in Table 2.6, taken
from the data compiled by Sigworth and Elliott.71

librium gas partial pressure; this is known as the Sievert’s law.

2.4.2.2.2 Solubility of H2O
From the free energy of formation of water vapor and the solubilitites of
hydrogen and oxygen in liquid iron, the following equilibrium constant is obtained for the reaction

2.4.2.2.3 Solubility of SO2
From the free energy of formation of SO2 and the solubilities of gaseous
sulfur and oxygen in liquid iron, the following equilibrium constant is obtained for the reaction of
SO2 with liquid iron at 1600°C.
SO2(g) = [S] + 2[O]
(2.4.18)
(2.4.19)
For the concentrations of sulfur and oxygen present in liquid steel, it is seen that the correspond-
ing equilibrium pressure of SO2 is infinitesimally small. It is for this reason that no sulfur can be
oxidized to SO2 during steelmaking with oxygen blowing.
2.4.3 Iron-Carbon Alloys
2.4.3.1 Fe-C Phase Equilibrium Diagram

There are three invariants in this system; peritectic at 1499°C, eutectic at 1152°C and eutectoid at
738°C. The phase boundaries shown by broken lines are for the metastable equilibrium of cementite,
Fe3C, with austenite. During heat treatment of steel if sufficient time is allowed, iron-carbon alloys
containing austenite and cementite decompose to austentite and graphite. The solubilitites of graphite
and of cementite in a-iron below the eutectoid temperature are given by the following equations
(2.4.20)
(2.4.21)
The solubility of graphite in pure liquid iron is well established through many independent stud-
ies; the experimental data are summarized by the equation
[%C] = 1.30 + 2.57 x 10–3T(°C)
(2.4.22)
If atom fraction NC is used, the same set of data can be represented by the following equation in
terms of log NC and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature.
(2.4.23)
The effect of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, manganese, cobalt and nickel on the solubility of
graphite in molten iron was determined by Turkdogan et al.72, 73 and graphite solubility in iron-
silicon and iron-manganese melts by Chipman et at.74, 75 Similar measurements with iron-
chromium melts were made by Griffing and co-workers.76 The experimental data are given
graphically in Fig. 2.35 for 1500°C; the solubility at other temperatures can be estimated from
this plot by using the temperature coefficient given in equation 2.4.22 for binary iron-carbon
melts. In the iron-sulfur-carbon system there is a large miscibility gap. For example, at 1500°C
the melt separates into two liquids containing
phase (I)  1.8% S and 4.24% C and phase (II)
26.5% S and 0.90% C.
2.4.3.2 Activity Coefficient of Carbon
The activity of carbon in liquid iron was mea-
sured in many independent studies. The data
compiled and re-assessed by Elliott et al.77 are
given in Figs. 2.36 and 2.37 as activity coeffi-
cients gC and f C for two different standard
states.
2.4.3.3 Peritectic Reaction
The peritectic reaction occurring in the early
stages of solidification of low carbon steels is
of particular importance in the continuous
casting of steel. The peritectic region of the
Fe–C system is shown on a larger scale in Fig.
2.38. As the temperature decreases within the
two phase region, d+liquid, the carbon con-
tents of d-iron and residual liquid iron
increase. At the peritectic temperature 1499°C,
d-iron containing 0.10% C reacts with liquid
iron containing 0.52% C to form g-iron with
0.16% C.

The X-ray diffraction data give for the densities of iron-carbon alloys: 7.89 g cm-3 for d–Fe with
0.10% C and 8.26 g cm-3 for g–Fe with 0.16% C. Hence, the d to g phase transformation is accom-
panied by 4.7% volume shrinkage. Because of this shrinkage, the thin solidified shell in the mould
of the caster will contract, producing a gap between the shell surface and mould wall. This situation
leads to an uneven surface which is in partial contact with the mould wall, hence resulting in reduced
heat flux at contracted areas. A reduced solidification growth rate and a nonuniform shell with thin
spots, lowers the resistance of the steel to cracking which my cause a breakout in the mould. This phe-
nomenon was well demonstrated experimentally by Singh and Blazek78 using a bench scale caster;
this subject is discussed further in a
paper by Wolf and Kurz.79
In low alloy steels containing 0.10 to
0.16% C, the solid/liquid ratio at the
peritectic invariant is higher than for
steels containing more than 0.16% C.
Therefore, due to the peritectic reac-
tion, low alloy steels with 0.10 to 0.16%
C are more susceptible to the develop-
ment of surface cracks in continuous
casting than steels with higher carbon
contents.
2.4.3.3.1 Effect of Alloying Elements on
Peritectic Invariant
As shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 2.39 for the ternary
Fe–C–X, or multicomponent alloy steels,
the peritectic reaction occurs over a
temperature and composition range.
From the experimental data on the liq-
uidus and solidus temperatures of alloy
steels, the carbon and temperature
equivalents of alloying elements have
been evaluated in three independent
investigations.80–82

The phase boundaries in the peritectic region of the Fe–C–X alloys, projected on the Fe–C–X com-
position diagram, are shown schematically in Fig. 2.41 for alloys where X is: (a) ferrite stabiliser
and (b) austenite stabiliser. In the Fe–C–Mn (or Ni) system, the peritectic reaction occurs at all com-
positons between the peritectic regions of the binaries Fe–C and Fe–Mn (Ni) systems. In the Fe–C
alloys with ferrite stabilisers, the peritectic reaction will not occur beyond a certain concentration of
the alloying element X as shown in Fig. 2.41. This limiting case applies only to high alloy steels.
2.4.4 Liquidus Temperatures of Low Alloy Steels
The liquidus temperatures of low alloy steels are derived from the binary Fe–X systems on the
assumption that the coefficients a = DT/%X are additive in their effects on the melting point of iron.
Below 0.5% C, where the solidification begins with the formation of delta (d) iron, the following
equation would apply
Liquidus T (°C) = 1537 – 73.1[%C] + Sa[%X]
(2.4.29)
For the carbon contents within the range 0.5 to 1.0% C, where the solidification begins with the
formation of gamma (g) iron, the following equation is recommended.
Liquidus T (°C) = 1531 – 61.5[%C] + Sa[%X]
(2.4.30)
The same coefficients a are used in both equations.

2.4.5 Solubility of Iron Oxide in Liquid Iron
Subsequent to earlier studies by various investigators, Taylor and Chipman83 made the most reli-
able measurement of the oxygen solubility in liquid iron in equilibrium with essentially pure liq-
uid iron oxide at temperatures of 1530–1700°C. In a later study, Distin et al.84 extended the
solubility measurements up to 1960°C. The solubility data are represented by the equation

2.4.6 Elements of Low Solubility in Liquid Iron
A few elements of low solubility in liquid iron play some role in the steelmaking technology; a
brief comment on the chemistry of such elements in liquid iron is considered desirable.
2.4.6.1 Lead
The break out of the furnace lining is often blamed
on the presence of lead in the melt. Small amounts
of metal trapped in the crevices of the lining are
likely to get oxidized subsequent to tapping. The
lead oxide together with iron oxide will readily
flux the furnace lining, hence widening the cracks
which ultimately leads to failure of the lining. The
solubility of lead in liquid iron is sufficiently high
that in normal steelmaking practice there should
be no accumulation of lead at the bottom of the
melt, except perhaps in the early stages of the
melting of lead-containing scrap.
At steelmaking temperatures the vapor pressure
of lead is about 0.5 atm and the solubility85 in
liquid iron is about 0.24% Pb at 1500°C increas-
ing to about 0.4% Pb at 1700°C. The free-
machining leaded steels contain 0.15 to 0.35%
Pb. Evidently lead added to such steels is in solu-
tion in the metal prior to casting and precipitates
as small lead spheroids during the early stages of
freezing.
2.4.6.2 Calcium
The boiling point of calcium is 1500°C and its
solubility in liquid iron is very low. Sponseller
and Flinn86 measured the solubility of calcium in
iron at 1607°C for which the calcium vapor pres-
sure is 1.69 atm. Under these conditions at
1607°C, 0.032% Ca is in solution. That is, the sol-
ubility at 1 atm pressure is 189 ppm Ca. They also
investigated the effect of some alloying elements
on the solubility; as seen from the data in Fig.
2.42, C, Si, Ni and Al increase markedly the cal-
cium solubility in liquid iron. In melts saturated
with CaC2 the solubility of calcium of course
decreases with an increasing carbon content.

2.4.6.3 Magnesium
The solubility of magnesium in iron-carbon alloys determined by Trojan and Flinn87, is shown is
Fig. 2.43 as functions of temperature and carbon content. Subsequently, Guichelaar et al.88, made
similar measurements with liquid Fe-Si-Mg alloys. Their data have been used in numerous studies
to derive the equilibrium relations for the solubility of magnesium in liquid iron. However, there
are some variations in the interpretation of the above mentioned experimental data. A reassessment
of these experimental data is considered desirable.
The equilibrium relation for the solubility of Mg (in units of mass % atm-1) is represented by
(2.4.32)
where fMg is the activity coefficient affected by the alloying elements. In the experiments with the
Fe–C–Mg melts coexistent with liquid Mg, the latter contained less than 2 percent Fe, therefore,
the Mg vapor pressure prevailing in the reactor would be essentially the same as that for pure Mg
for which the following is obtained from the data of Guichelaar, et al.

2.4.7 Surface Tension
The experimental data for the surface tension of liquid iron and its binary alloys have been com-
piled recently by Keene.89 For purified liquid iron, the average value of the surface tension at tem-
perature T(°C) is represented by
sFe = (2367 ± 500) – 0.34(°C), mNm–1
(2.4.34)
Keene derived the following weighted average limiting values of (mNm-1) for dilute solutions of X
in Fe-X binary alloys.
Fe–C:
Virtually no effect of C on sFe
Fe–Ce:
s = sFe - 700[%Ce]

Gibbs’ exact treatment of surface thermodynamics gives, for fixed unit surface area and constant
temperature and pressure,
(2.4.35)
where Gi is the surface excess concentration of the ith component and ai its activity. For a ternary
system, equation 2.4.35 is reduced to
ds = –RT(G2d(ln a2) + G3d(ln a3))
(2.4.36)
Since carbon dissolved in iron has virtually no effect on the surface tension of liquid iron, for the
ternary system Fe–C–S, equation 2.4.36 is simplified to
ds = –RTGsd(ln as)
(2.4.37)
As is seen from the compiled data in Fig. 2.44, the experimental results of various investigators for
the Fe–S melts are in close agreement. References to these data are given in an earlier publication.90

complete surface coverage with chemisorbed S. The shaded area represents the data of Selcuk and

2.4.8 Density
The temperature dependence of the densities of liquid iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, chromium, man-
ganese, vanadium and titanium are given by the following equations as a linear function of tem-
perature in °C in g cm–3:
Iron:
8.30 – 8.36 ´ 10–4T
Nickel:
9.60 – 12.00 ´ 10–4T
Cobalt:
9.57 – 10.17 ´ 10–4T
Copper:
9.11 – 9.44 ´ 10–4T
Chromium:
7.83 – 7.23 ´ 10–4T
Manganese:
7.17 – 9.30 ´ 10–4T
Vanadium:
6.06 – 3.20 ´ 10–4T
Titanium:
4.58 – 2.26 ´ 10–4T
The specific volume and density of liquid iron-carbon alloys are given in Fig. 2.48 for various tem-
peratures. It should be noted that the density of the liquid in equilibrium with austenite does not
change much over the entire liquidus range.
2.4.9 Viscosity
The viscosity is a measure of resistance of the fluid to flow when subjected to an external force. As
conceived by Newton, the shear stress e, i.e. force per unit area, causing a relative motion of two adja-
cent layers in a fluid is proportional to the velocity gradient du/dz, normal to the direction of the
applied force
(2.4.38)
where the proportionality factor h is viscosity of the fluid (liquid or gas).

Viscosity unit: poise (g cm-1s–1) º 0.1N s m–2.
The viscosities of Fe–C alloys determined by Barfield and Kitchener96 are given in Fig. 2.49. In the
iron-carbon melts the coefficient of viscosity is essentially independent of composition within the
range 0.8 to 2.5% C; above 2.5% C, the viscosity decreases continously with an increasing carbon
content.
2.4.10 Diffusivity, Electrical and Thermal Conductivity, and Thermal Diffusivity
The diffusivity is an exponential function of temperature,

The general trend in the temperature dependence of solute diffusivity in solid iron is shown in Fig.
2.50. The interstitial elements, e.g. O, N, C, B, H have diffusivities much greater than the substitu-
tional elements. Because of larger interatomic spacing, the diffusivities of interstitials in bcc-iron
are greater and the heats of activations (~ 85 kJ) are smaller than those in the fcc-iron with E ~ 170
kJ. With the substitutional elements, the heat of activation is within 210 to 250 kJ for bcc-iron and
within 250 to 290 kJ for fcc-iron.
In liquid iron alloys, diffusivities of elements are within 10–5 to 10–4 cm2s-1 with E within 15 to 50 kJ.
Some solute diffusivity data for liquid iron and iron-carbon alloys are given in Table 2.11.

The electrical conductivity l in the units of W–1cm–1 is the reciprocal of the electrical resistivity. The
electrical conductivity of liquid low alloy steel is about l = 7140 W–1cm–1 at steelmaking temperatures.
From Fick’s law, the thermal conductivity is defined by
(2.4.40)
where Q is heat flux, energy per unit per unit time, ¶T/¶x the temperature gradient normal to the
direction of heat flow and k the thermal conductivity.
Units of k: J cm–1s–1K–1 º 10–2 kg m s–3K–1 º 10–2 Wm–1K–1
The effect of temperature on the thermal conductivities of iron, carbon steels and high alloy steels
are shown in Fig. 2.51.
Analogous to mass diffusivity, the thermal diffusivity is defined as
(2.4.41)
where r is density and Cp molar heat capacity. In metals, the electrons migrate at much faster rates
than the atoms; therefore the thermal diffusivity is much greater than the mass diffusivity.

2.5 Properties of Molten Slags
2.5.1 Structural Aspects
Molten slags are ionic in nature consisting of positively charged ions known as cations, and nega-
tively charged complex silicate, aluminate and phosphate ions known as anions.
The fundamental building unit in solid silica and molten silicates is the silicate tetrahedron SiO44–.
Each silicon atom is tetrahedrally surrounded by four oxygen atoms and each oxygen atom is
bonded to two silicon atoms. The valency of silicon is +4 and that of oxygen is –2, therefore the
silicate tetrahedron has 4 negative charges.
The addition of metal oxides such as FeO, CaO, MgO, . . . to molten silica brings about a break-
down of the silicate network, represented in a general form by the reaction 
(2.5.1)
The cations are dispersed within the broken silicate network. In MO–SiO2 melts the atom ratio
O/Si > 2, therefore part of the oxygen atoms are bonded between two silicon atoms and part to only
one silicon atom. Partial depolymerization of the silicate network with the addition of a metal oxide
MO is illustrated in Fig. 2.52.

Fig. 2.52 Schematic representation
of depolymerization of the silicate
network with the dissolution of metal
oxides in silicate melts.
In highly basic slags with molar ratio MO/SiO2 > 2, the silicate network completely breaks down
to individual SiO4 tetrahedra intermixed with cations M2+ and some oxygen ions O2–.
At low concentrations, Al2O3 behaves like a network-modifying oxide and forms aluminum cations
Al3+. At high concentrations, the aluminum enters the tetrahedral structure isomorphous with silicon.
This process may be schematically represented by the reaction
(2.5.2)
The cation M+ is located in the vicinity of Al–O bonding to preserve the local charge balance. At low
concentrations of phosphorus in steelmaking slags, the phosphate ions PO43– are incorporated in the
silicate network. In steelmaking slags, the sulfur exists as a sulfide ion S2–. The sulfate ions SO42– exist
in slags only under highly oxidizing conditions and in the absence of iron or any other oxidizable metal.

Although molten slags are ionized, the slag composition can be represented in terms of the con-
stituent oxides, e.g. CaO, FeO, SiO2, P2O5. The thermodynamic activity of an ion in the slag can-
not be determined. However, the activity of an oxide dissolved in molten slag, forming M2+ and
O2– ions, can be determined experimentally and the following equality can be written
MO ® M2+ + O2–
(2.5.3)
(2.5.4)
where the superscript ° refers to the standard state which is usually pure solid or liquid oxide.
2.5.2 Slag Basicity
For steelmaking slags of low phosphorus content, the slag basicity has traditionally been repre-
sented by the mass concentration ratio
(2.5.5)
For slags containing high concentrations of MgO and P2O5, as in some laboratory experiments, the
basicity may be defined by the following mass concentration ratio, with the assumption that on a
molar basis the concentrations of CaO and MgO are equivalent. Similarly, on a molar basis 1/2
P2O5, i.e. PO2.5, is equivalent to SiO2.
(2.5.6)
For slags containing MgO < 8% and P2O5 < 5%, the basicity B is essentially directly proportional
to V.
B = 1.17V
(2.5.7)
Another measure of slag basicity is the difference between the sum of the concentrations of basic
oxides and acidic oxides.
(%CaO + %MgO + %MnO) – (%SiO2 + P2O5 + TiO2)
(2.5.8)
This formulation of slag basicity is not used very often.
For the calcium aluminate type of slags used in steel refining in the ladle furnace, the slag basic-
ity used in some German and Japanese publications, is defined by the ratio
(2.5.9)
However, such a ratio becomes meaningless at low concentrations of either SiO2 or Al2O3. For the
ladle furnace slag the basicity may be defined by the following mass concentration ratio, on the
assumption that on a molar basis Al2O3 is equivalent to SiO2.
(2.5.10)
The slag basicities as defined above are for the compositions of molten slags. In practice, the steel-
making slags often contain undissolved CaO and MgO. The chemical analyses of such slag sam-
ples without correction for undissolved CaO and MgO, will give unrealistic basicities which are
much higher than those in the molten part of the slag.
There has been a trend in recent years to relate some physiochemical properties of slags, such as
sulfide capacity, phosphate capacity, carbide capacity, etc., to optical slag basicity. The optical
basicity is discussed briefly in Section 2.5.12.

2.5.3 Iron Oxide in Slags
Iron oxide dissolves in slags in two valency states: divalent iron cations Fe2+ and trivalent iron
cations Fe3+. The ratio Fe3+/ Fe2+ depends on temperature, oxygen potential and slag composition;
this is discussed later in this section. In the formulation of the equilibrium constants of slag-metal
reactions and the thermodynamic activities of oxides in slags, the total iron dissolved in the slag as
oxides is usually converted to the stoichiometric formula FeO and denoted by FetO, thus
%FetO = %FeO (analyzed) + 0.9 x %Fe2O3 (analyzed)
(2.5.11)
or
%FetO = 1.286 x %Fe (total as oxides)
(2.5.12)
For the ease of understanding, the subscript t will be omitted in all the subsequent equations and
diagrams.
2.5.4 Selected Ternary and Quaternary Oxide Systems
Most steelmaking slags consist primarily of CaO, MgO, SiO2 and FeO. In low-phosphorus steel-
making practices, the total concentration of these oxides in liquid slags is in the range 88 to 92%.
Therefore, the simplest type of steelmaking slag to be considered is the quaternary system
CaO–MgO–SiO2–FeO.
First let us consider the ternary system CaO·SiO2–FeO; the liquidus isotherms of this system is
shown in Fig. 2.53. The isothermal section of the composition diagram in Fig. 2.54 shows the phase
equilibria at 1600°C.

There are four two-phase regions where, as depicted by dotted lines, the melt is saturated with
SiO2, 2CaO·SiO2, 3CaO·SiO2 or CaO; two three-phase regions (2CaO·SiO2 + 3CaO·SiO2 + liquid)
and (3CaO·SiO2 + CaO + liquid); and one liquid phase region.
Magnesia is another important ingredient of steelmaking slags, which are invariably saturated with
MgO to minimize slag attack on the magnesia refractory lining of the furnace.
The effect of MgO on the solubility of calcium silicates and calcium oxide is shown in 
Fig 2.55 for the system (CaO + MgO)–SiO2–FeO, in equilibrium with liquid iron at 1600°C.

The broken-line curve delineates the region of saturation of molten slag with solid calcium (magne-
sium) silicates and solid magnesio-wustite (MgO–FeO solid solution). Effects of the concentrations
of MgO and FeO on the solubility of CaO in 2CaO·SiO2-saturated slags are shown in Fig. 2.56.

Pertinent to the compositions of neutral ladle slags, the phase equilibria in part of the system
CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 at 1600°C is shown in Fig. 2.58.
2.5.5 Oxide Activities in Slags
In this section the activity data are given for a few ternary and multicomponent systems which are
closely related to the iron and steelmaking slags.
2.5.5.1 Activities in CaO – FeO–SiO2 System
The oxide activities in the CaO–FeO–SiO2 melts relevant to oxygen steelmaking in equilibrium
with liquid iron at about 1550°C are given in Fig. 2.59. The iso-activity curves in the left dia-
gram represent the experimentally determined activities of iron oxide with respect to liquid
FeO.98–99 The activities of CaO and SiO2 with respect to solid oxides were calculated from the

Recently new iron smelting processes have been developed and are briefly discussed here. The
slags are CaO–SiO2–FeO–A12O3–MgO (saturated) with low FeO contents (<5%). Knowledge
of the activity of FeO in these slags is critical and has been recently measured by Liu et al.100
The activity coefficient of FeO in these slags is given in Fig. 2.60 and is approximately 3.5. It
increases slightly with basicity as shown in Fig. 2.61 but is nearly constant with a value of 3.5.

2.5.5.2 Activities in CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 System
Rein and Chipman101 measured the activity of silica in the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 system; from these
experimental data they calculated the activities of CaO and Al2O3 by Gibbs-Duhem integration.
The salient features of these oxide activities at 1600°C, with respect to solid oxides, are shown in
Fig. 2.62 for the mass ratios of CaO/Al2O3 = 2/3 and 3/2; the compositions of ladle slags are well
within the range given in Fig. 2.62.
Rein and Chipman also measured the activity of silica in the quaternary melts CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2.
The activity coefficients of SiO2 derived from these data are given in Fig. 2.63 for melts contain-
ing 10% MgO and 0, 10 or 20% Al2O3.

The ratio of the activities (aAl2O3)1/3/aCaO within the entire liquid composition range up to 30% SiO2
is shown in Fig. 2.64 reproduced from Ref. 27.
2.5.5.3 Activities in MnO–Al2O3–SiO2 System
In the deoxidation of steel with the ladle addition of silicomanganese and aluminum together, the
deoxidation product is molten manganese aluminosilicate with the mass ratio MnO/SiO2 at about
1:1 and containing 10 to 45% Al2O3. The activities of oxides in the MnO–Al2O3–SiO2 melts at
1550 and 1650°C were computed by Fujisawa and Sakao102 from the available thermochemical data
on the system. They also determined experimentally the activities of MnO and SiO2 by the selected
slag-metal equilibrium measurements and found a close agreement with the computed data.
The activities of Al2O3 and SiO2, with respect to solid oxides, are plotted in Fig. 2.65 for melts with
mass ratio of MnO/SiO2 = 1. For melts containing up to 30% Al2O3 the activity of MnO remains
essentially unchanged at about 0.1 then decreases to about 0.05 at 40% Al2O3.
2.5.5.4 Activity Coefficient of FeO in Slags
With hypothetical pure liquid FeO as the standard state, the activity of iron oxide is derived from
the concentration of dissolved oxygen in liquid iron that is in equilibrium with the slag. For the
reaction equilibrium
FeO(l) = Fe + [O]
(2.5.13)

In the past a wide variety of formulations were generated to represent the composition dependence
of the iron oxide activity or activity coefficient in complex slag. On a recent reassessment of this
property of the slag, Turkdogan103 came to the conclusion that, within the limits of uncertainty of
the experimental data on slag-metal reaction equi-
librium, there is a decisive correlation between the
activity coefficient of FeO and the slag basicity as
shown in Fig. 2.66. The gFeO reaches a peak at a
basicity of about B = 1.8. It should be pointed out
once again that the concentration of iron oxide is
for total iron as oxides in the slag represented by
the stoichiometric formula FeO.
As discussed in Ref. 103, the experimental data
used in deriving the relation in Fig. 2.66 are for
simple and complex slags which differ consider-
ably in their compositions thus: in mass percent,
CaO 0–60, MgO 0–20, SiO2 0–35, P2O5 0–20,
FeO 5–40, MnO 0–15. 
2.5.5.5 Activity of MnO in Slags
The activity coefficient ratio g FeO/g Mno, derived
from the slag-metal equilibrium data cited in Ref.
103, varies with slag basicity as shown in Fig.
2.67. There is a sharp decrease in the ratio of the
activity coefficients as the basicity B increases
from 1.5 to 2.0. At basicities above 2.5, the ratio
gFeO/g MnO is essentially constant at about 0.63. The
curve for g MnO in Fig. 2.66 is that derived from the
combination of the curve for g FeO with the ratio in
Fig. 2.67.

2.5.6 Gas Solubility in Slags
2.5.6.1 Solubility of H2O
In acidic melts, H2O vapor reacts with double
bonded oxygen and depolymerizes the melt, thus
In basic melts, H2O reacts with free oxygen ions
(O2–) + H2O = 2(OH)–
(2.5.16)
Both for acidic and basic melts the overall reaction is
represented by
(O*) + H2O = 2(OH*)
(2.5.17)
where O* represents double or single bonded oxygen,
or O2–, and OH* is single bonded to silicon or as a free
ion. The equilibrium constant for a given melt compo-
sition is
(2.5.18)
where PH2O is the vapor partial pressure.
The solubilities of H2O (in units of mass ppm H2O) at 1 atm pressure of H2O vapor in CaO–FeO–SiO2
at 1550°C, measured by Iguchi et al.104 are given in Fig. 2.68.

2.5.6.2 Solubility of N2
Nitrogen dissolves in molten slags as a nitride ion N3– only under reducing conditions
1/2N2(g) + 3/2(O2–) = (N3–) + 3/4O2(g)
(2.5.19)
for which the equilibrium constant (known as nitride capacity) is
(2.5.20)
Many studies have been made of the solubility of nitrogen in CaO–Al2O3 and CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 melts
in the 1970s. These were reviewed in a previous publication3. Reference should be made also to a sub-
sequent work done by Ito and Fruehan105 on the nitrogen solubility in the CaO– Al2O3–SiO2 melts. They
showed that the nitride capacity of the aluminosilicate melts increases with a decreasing activity of CaO.
2.5.6.2.1 Nitrogen Dissolution into Slags
The nitride capacity in certain slag systems increases and in
others decreases with basicity. According to equation 2.5.19 one would expect it to increase with
increasing slag basicity, i.e. increasing concentration of free oxygen ion O2–. The reason for this
apparent contradiction is that nitrogen can enter the slag by replacing single bonded oxygen ions
in the SiO2 network. This phenomena is explained in detail by Ito and Fruehan.105
Briefly, spectroscopic research indicates that the nitrogen is combined with the network former in
silicate melts which can be represented by 
(2O–) + 1/2N2 =(N–) + 1/2 (O2–) + 3/4 O2
(2.5.21)
where O– is a nonbridging system in the network. If SiO2 is the network former equation 2.5.21
corresponds to 
(2.5.22)
In this case the nitride capacity is given by 
(2.5.23)
where K is an equilibrium constant for reaction 2.5.21, fi is an activity coefficient for species i. In this
case N3– does not mean a free
nitride ion but the nitrogen analyzed
as a nitride which is associated with
the network former. Similar reac-
tions can be written for bridging
oxygen, but then reactions are less
likely. In either case the nitride
capacity decreases with oxygen ion
activity, i.e. increasing slag basicity.
For the CaO–SiO2, CaO–Al2O3,
and CaO–SiO2–Al2O3 systems CaO
is the basic component. Therefore
the equations predict that a plot of
the logarithm of nitride capacity
versus the logarithm of the activity
of CaO should yield a straight line
with a slope of –1⁄2 as shown in Fig.
2.69.

For highly basic oxide systems the nitrogen enters as a free nitride ion and the simple relationship
given by 2.5.19 is valid. In this case the free nitride concentration and the nitride capacity is pro-
portional to the oxygen ion activity to the 3/2 power (aO2–)3/2. Min and Fruehan106 have shown that
the nitride capacity does increase with basicity for highly basic slags, particularly when there is no
strong network former such as SiO2 present. In theory the nitride capacity should decrease with
basicity when the nitrogen is primarily in the network and increase when it is a free nitride. This
was observed for the BaO–B2O3 and CaO–B2O3 system as shown in Fig. 2.70.

The equilibrium nitrogen distribution ratio between slag and steel is very low even at high alu-
minum contents, well above the practical range. The slag/steel mass ratio in the ladle is also low,
about 1/100. For these reasons, liquid steel in the ladle cannot be de-nitrogenized by the slag that
is usable in industry in steel refining.
As noted from the recent experimental studies of Fruehan and co-workers,106–108 that even with fluxes
of high nitride capacities (as with alkaline earth borates) it is not practically possible to remove nitro-
gen from the aluminum-killed steel in the ladle. The highest nitride capacity was for a slag containing
about 22% CaO – 27% BaO – 48% Al2O3 – 3% TiO2 and was about 5 ´ 10–12. For this case for a steel
containing 0.06% Al the nitrogen distribution ratio is about 5.5 which is still not high enough for effec-
tive nitrogen removal.
2.5.6.3 Solubility of S2
Sulfur-bearing gases dissolve in molten slags as sulfide ions (S2–) under reducing conditions, and
as sulfate ions (SO42–) under highly oxidizing conditions. In steelmaking the oxygen potential is
not high enough for the solution of sulfur as sulfate ions, therefore we need to consider only the
sulfide reaction.
Whether the sulfur-bearing species is primarily H2S or SO2, there is a corresponding equilibrium
value of pS2 depending on the temperature and gas composition. It is convenient to consider the
reaction in a general form as
1/2S2(g) + (O2–) = (S2–) + 1/2O2(g)
(2.5.26)
For a given slag composition the equilibrium relation is represented by
(2.5.27)
where p’s are equilibrium gas partial pressures. The equilibrium constant CS is known as the sul-
fide capacity of the slag. The value of CS depends on slag composition and temperature.
Experimentally determined sulfide capacities of binary oxide melts are shown in Fig. 2.71. Refer-
ences to experimental data are given in Ref. 3.
For the slag-metal system, the sulfur reaction is formulated in terms of the activities 
(@ concentrations) of sulfur and oxygen dissolved in the steel.
[S] + (O2–) = (S2–) + [O]
(2.5.28)
For low-alloy steels
(2.5.29)
where the equilibrium constant kS depends on slag composition and temperature.
2.5.6.3.1 Conversion of pO2 / pS2 to [%O]/[%S]
The free energies of solution of O2 and S2 in liquid low
alloy steel are given below; see Table 2.1 in section 2.1.2.4.2.
1/2S2 = [S];     DGs = –135,060 + 23.43TJ
(2.5.30)
1/2O2 = [O];     DGo = –115,750 – 4.63TJ
(2.5.31)
For the reaction equilibrium
1/2S2 = [O] = 1/2O2 + [S]
the standard free energy change is
DG° = DGs – DGo = –19,310 + 28.06TJ

A slag of high kS value and steel deoxidation to low levels of [O] are necessary conditions for steel
desulfurization. The subject is discussed in more detail later.
2.5.6.4 Solubility of O2
Oxygen dissolves in molten slags by oxidizing the divalent iron ions to the trivalent state.
Gas–slag reaction:     1/2O2(g) + 2(Fe2+) = 2(Fe3+) + (O2–)
(2.5.36)
Slag–metal reaction:     Fe° + 4(Fe3+) + (O2–) = 5(Fe2+) + [O]
(2.5.37)
These reactions provide the mechanism for oxygen transfer from gas to metal through the over-
laying slag layer. Partly for this reason, the steel reoxidation will be minimized by maintaining a
low concentration of iron oxide in the ladle slag, tundish and mold fluxes.
Examples are given in Fig. 2.72 of variations of the ratio Fe3+/Fe2+ with slag composition of melts
co-existing with liquid iron, reproduced from a paper by Ban-ya and Shim109.

2.5.7.1 Interfacial Tension
The slag-metal interfacial tensions have values between those for the gas-slag and gas-
metal surface tensions. Consequently, the addition of surface active elements to liquid iron
lowers the slag-metal interfacial tension.
Effects of sulfur and oxygen dissolved in iron on the interfacial tension between liquid iron and
CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 melts at 1600°C, determined by Gaye et al.112, are shown in Figs. 2.75 and 2.76;
compared to the surface tensions of Fe–S and Fe–O melts. The effect of oxygen on the interfacial ten-
sion is greater than sulfur, e.g. si = 600 mN m–1 with aO = 0.05 (0.05%) while at aS = 0.05 (0.05%),
si = 1000 mN m–1.

As shown by Ogino et al.113 Fig. 2.77, a single curve describes adequately the effect of oxygen in
iron on the interfacial tension between liquid iron and a wide variety of simple and complex slags,
including those containing Na2O and CaF2. In the case of slags containing iron oxide, a decrease
in interfacial tension with an increasing iron oxide content is due entirely to the corresponding
increase in the oxygen content of the iron.
Recently Jimbo and Cramb114 accurately measured the interfacial tension between liquid iron and
CaO–Al2O2–SiO2 slags. As shown in Fig. 2.78 their results are slightly higher than those of Gaye et al.

2.5.8 Density
Many repetitive measurements of slag densities have been made. Only selected references are
given on the density data cited here for steelmaking type of slags. Since the density of silica
(2.15 g cm–3 at 1700°C) is much lower than the densities of other metal oxide components of
slags, densities of slags will decrease with an increasing silica content.
The density data for binary silicates are given in Fig. 2.79. The data in Fig. 2.80 are for
CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 melts, relevant to neutral slags for steel refining in the ladle.

2.5.9 Viscosity
The size of the silicate and aluminosilicate network in molten slags becomes larger with increas-
ing SiO2 and Al2O3 contents, hence their mobility decreases resulting in a higher viscosity. The
addition of metal oxides or an increase in temperature leads to the breakdown of the Si(Al)O4 net-
work, resulting in lower melt viscosity.
Machin and Yee123 made an extensive study of the viscosity of CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 melts at
temperatures of 1350 to 1500°C. The data in Fig. 2.82 are for the ternary system at 1500°C. The
isokoms are approximately parallel to the binary side Al2O3–SiO2, indicating that Al2O3–SiO2 are
isomorphous in their effect on the slag viscosity. The isokoms in Fig. 2.83 are for the quaternary
system with 35% and 50% SiO2. In this case, the isokoms are approximately parallel to the binary
side CaO–MgO, indicating that Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations have similar effects on the breakdown of the
aluminosilicate network.

Viscosities of steelmaking slags are well represented by the experimental data of Kozakevitch110
given in Fig. 2.84
In the study of viscosities of mold fluxes for continuous casting, the experimental results have been
represented as a function of temperature using the relation.
h = AT exp (B/T)
(2.5.39)
where A and B are functions of slag composition. For the composition range (wt %) 33–56% SiO2,
12–45% CaO, 0–11% Al2O3, 0–20% Na2O and 0–20% CaF2, an interpolation formula has been derived
for the parameters A and B as a function of the mole fractions of the constituents as given below.
lnA = –17.51 – 35.76(Al2O3) + 1.73(CaO) + 5.82(CaF2) + 7.02(Na2O)
(2.5.40)
B = 31,1140 – 68,833(Al2O3) – 23,896(CaO) – 46,351(CaF2) – 39,519(Na2O)
(2.5.41)
where A is in units of 0.1 N s m–2 K–1 ( poise/deg.) and B in degrees Kelvin.
2.5.10 Mass Diffusivity, Electrical Conductivity and Thermal Conductivity
2.5.10.1 Mass Diffusivity
Because of the ionic nature of molten slags, the diffusive mass transfer is by ions. The ionic diffu-
sivities are measured using the radioactive tracer elements dissolved in an oxidized form in the
melt. Typical examples of ionic diffusivities in slags at 1600°C are given below.

Since the electroneutrality has to be maintained, diffusion of a cation is accompanied by diffusion
of the oxygen ion. The diffusion that occurs in the dissolution of a solid oxide in the slag is con-
trolled by the mobility of the O2– ion which is smaller than the divalent cations.

2.5.10.2 Electrical Conductivity
The electrical current in molten slags is carried by the cations. However, in slags containing high con-
centrations of FeO or MnO (> 70%) the electronic conduction becomes the dominant mechanism.
The ionic conductivity li is theoretically related to the self diffusivity of the ionic species i by the
Nernst-Einstein equation
(2.5.42)
where 
F
=

Zi
=

Ci

li
=
specific conductivity, W–1cm–1.
For steelmaking slags: l = 0.5–1.5 W–1cm–1.
For ladle slags: l = 0.4–0.7 W–1cm–1.
The electrical conductivity increases with an increasing slag basicity and increasing temperature.
2.5.10.3 Thermal Conductivity
Because of the presence of iron oxide, the metallurgical slags are opaque to infrared radiation,
therefore the heat conduction is primarily thermal.
Thermal conductivity of slags and mold fluxes are in the range 0.5 to 1.2 Wm–1K–1. From experi-
mental data the following approximate empirical relation has been found
k(Wm–1 K–1) = 1.8 ´ 10–5 V–1
(2.5.43)
where V is the molar volume = M/r, m3mol–1.
2.5.11 Slag Foaming
Slag foaming plays an important role in many steelmaking processes. In oxygen steelmaking
excessive foaming can lead to slopping. On the other hand controlled foaming in the electric arc
furnace is desirable to protect the refractories from the electrical arc radiation. In the direct iron-
making processes such as DIOS and AISI Direct Steelmaking, excessive foaming can cause oper-
ational problems. However some foam is desirable to help capture the energy from post
combustion. Slag foaming should not be confused with simple gas bubbling or hold up. Whenever
gas passes through a liquid, the liquid expands due to the presence of the gas. However in some liq-
uids a stable foam develops which consists of foam bubbles on the top of an unfoamed liquid.
Early work on foaming was limited to a qualitative understanding of this complex phenomenon.
Due to the added importance of foaming in the EAF and iron bath systems Ito and Fruehan124,125
and other researchers developed a quantitative measure of foaming and measured the foaming
characteristics of many important slag systems. The foam index (S) was defined by 
(2.5.44)
(2.5.45)
where 
D
=
the increase in the height of the slag,
Vgs

the superficial gas velocity, 
Q

It follows that the volume of foam is approximately given by

The foam index has the units of time and represents the average traveling time of the gas through
the foam. 
The foam can also be characterized by the time for the foam to decay. The average foam life (t) is
defined by the first order decay
(2.5.47)
where h and ho are the foam height and the foam height when the gas flow stops, respectively. It
can be shown that for an ideal foam, in which the gas fraction of the foam is constant, that the foam
index (S) and foam life (t) are equal.
The foam index for CaO–SiO2–FeO–Al2O3 system is shown in Fig. 2.85. The foam index decreases
initially with increasing basicity because the viscosity is decreasing. However when the solubility
limit is reached the foam index increases with basicity because the second phase particles increase
the bulk viscosity of the slag.
Zhang and Fruehan126 later demonstrated that the foam index on stability increased with decreas-
ing bubble size and developed a general correlation demonstrated in Fig. 2.86 from which the foam
index for many complex systems would be desired.
(2.5.48)
where

s

r

DB

Takumetsu et al127 showed that in bath smelting processes char could reduce foaming significantly.
Zhang and Fruehan128 examined the fundamentals of slag control by carbonaceous materials. Due
to surface tension phenomenon the slag foam bubbles collapse and form longer bubbles resulting in
a less stable foam. Carbonaceous materials will cause the foam to collapse while others such as alu-
mina particles or iron oxide pellets do not due to the different wetting characteristics with the slag.
The fundamentals of slag foaming have been applied to a variety of processes such as oxygen and
EAF steelmaking, bath smelting and ladle processing. The fundamental principles allow for rea-
sonable predictions of foaming in these processes.

2.5.12 Slag Models and Empirical Correlations for Thermodynamic Properties
There have been several attempts to develop models and correlations for slags, from which thermo-
dynamic properties such as activities and capacities can be predicted. Simple models such as a regu-
lar solution have been used.129 However because of the ionic nature and structure of slags they are
generally inadequate. Recently Gaye and Lehmann reviewed the current status of structural models.130
The most successful models have been developed by Gaye and coworkers131 at IRSID and Blander
et al.132 In the IRSID model the slag is represented using an oxygen sublattice and a cationic sub-
lattice. The structure is defined in terms of cells composed of a central oxygen surrounded by two
cations. Two parameters are used to calculate the energy of the system; the energies of formation
of asymmetric cells and the interaction energies limited to one parameter per couple of cations.
These parameters are computed from the known thermodynamics of the binary systems. It is
beyond the scope of this chapter to describe the model in greater detail. The model has been used
successfully to estimate the phase diagrams and thermodynamic activities in multi-component sys-
tems as well as sulfide capacities. Whereas this model is complex and requires binary data, to date
it is the best model available for estimating thermodynamic properties of slags.
In recent years various capacities such as the sulfide and phosphate capacities have been correlated
to a term called the optical basicity. This concept has been recently reviewed by Summerville et
al.133 Briefly each oxide is assigned a value for its optical basicity which is related to the Pauling
electronegativity. By definition the optical basicity of CaO is taken as unity. Components such as
Na2O have optical basicities greater than one while acidic oxides such as SiO2 have values less than
one. The optical basicity of a slag is then computed from a weighted average of the components in
the slag. The optical basicity has been used to correlate a large number of studies on sulfide and
other capacities.133, 134 Whereas the optical basicity is an interesting concept, the correlations are
not sufficiently accurate to predict capacities for industrial purposes. For example the deviations
between the correlation and actual data is 25–50% in some cases. This is not accurate enough for
computing sulfur equilibrium in industrial applications. However the optical basicity correlation
maybe useful for making crude estimates of capacities for which no data exists or to predict trends
when changing slag compositions slightly.
2.6 Fundamentals of Ironmaking Reactions
Reference may be made to a book entitled “The Iron Blast Furnace”, authored by Peacey and Daven-
port.135 In this book, the theoretical, experimental and operational data have been put together about the
blast furnace with particular emphasis on the interrelations between countercurrent heat and mass
transfer between gases and solids in the blast furnace stack. Reference may also be made to the earlier
studies of Rist and co-workers136–140 on the heat and mass transfer and reduction reactions in the stack.
In this section, the following aspects of the blast furnace reactions are considered: oxygen poten-
tial diagram, role of vapor species in blast furnace reactions, slag-metal equilibrium, reaction
mechanisms and operational slag-metal data.
2.6.1 Oxygen Potential Diagram
The reducibility of a metal oxide relative to other oxides, or the oxidisability of a metal relative to
other metals, can readily be assessed from the free energy data.
For the oxidation reaction involving pure metals and metal oxides in their standard states, 
i.e. aM = 1, aMO = 1
2M + O2 = 2MO
(2.6.1)
the isothermal equilibrium constant is
(2.6.2)
K =
1
2
pO

105
where pO2 is the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure for which the standard state is 1 atm at the
temperature under consideration. The standard free energy change is
DG° = –RT ln K = RT 1n pO2
(2.6.3)
which is also called the oxygen potential.
In an earlier study, Richardson and Jeffes141 compiled the free energy data on metal oxides which
were then available, and presented the data, Fig. 2.87, as an oxygen potential diagram.
The oxides for which the oxygen potential lines are above that of CO may be reduced by carbon.
As the affinity of the metals for oxygen increases, i.e. DG° decreases, the temperature of reduction
of the oxides by carbon increases.
For easy conversion of oxygen potentials to the corresponding values of pO2 or to the equilibrium
ratios of H2/ H2O and CO/CO2, appropriate scales are included in the enclosed oxygen potential
diagram for various oxides of metallurgical interest.
Scale for pO2:
Lines drawn from the point O on the ordinate for the absolute zero temperature through
the points marked on the right hand side of the diagram give the isobars. For example, for
the Fe–FeO equilibrium the oxygen potential is –82 kcal (–343 kJ) at 1200°C. By drawing
a line passing through this point and the point O, the oxygen partial pressure of about 7 ´
10–13 atm is read off the log pO2 scale.
Scale for CO/CO2:
Draw the line from point C to a point on the oxygen potential; the extension of this line
gives the corresponding equilibrium log CO/CO2 ratio.
Scale for H2/H2O:
Same as above by using point H.
These diagrams can be used to predict CO/CO2 or H2/H2O ratios as well as the pressure of oxygen
in equilibrium with numerous metals and their oxides. They are particularly useful for predicting
the CO/CO2 ratio in a blast furnace or the H2/H2O ratio in direct reduction with natural gas. It also
gives an indication of the relative reduceability of the oxides. It should be remembered that the dia-
grams are for unit activity of the metal. If the metal is in solution, it is easier to reduce. For exam-
ple, if the activity of Si is 10–3 relative to pure Si in liquid iron, the equilibrium oxygen pressure is
103 times higher. Similarly, if the activity of SiO2 is lowered in a slag it is more difficult to reduce.
2.6.2 Role of Vapor Species in Blast Furnace Reactions
Because of the high temperatures involved, vaporization plays a significant role in pyrometallurgi-
cal reactions. In a reactor such as a blast furnace, the formation and condensation of various vapor
species is responsible for the recycle of some of the elements between the high and low tempera-
ture regions of the furnace.
The countercurrent flow in the blast furnace of solids from low- to high-temperature zones and of
gases from high- to low-temperature zones brings about a cyclic process of vaporization and con-
densation which has a decisive influence on the overall operation of the furnace.
2.6.2.1 Vapor Species SiO, SiS and CS
It is now well established that the silicon and sulfur in the coke are transferred to the slag and iron
in the blast furnace via the vapor species SiO, SiS, CS, and other minor sulfur-bearing species. The
earlier and recent studies of quenched blast furnaces have revealed that while the sulfur content of
the slag increases with the descent of the burden in the bosh, the sulfur and silicon contents of the
metal droplets reach maxima and then decrease as they pass through the slag layer. This phenom-
enon of vapor-phase mass transfer has been substantiated by the experimental work of Tsuchiya et

al,142 Turkdogan et al 143 and Ozturk and Fruehan144 under conditions partly simulating the bosh
region of the blast furnace.
In the presence of carbon and depending on temperature and activity of silica in the slag or coke,
the SiO vapor is generated by one of the following reactions
SiO2 (in coke ash or slag) + C ® SiO + CO
(2.6.4)

At 1 bar pressure of CO, aSiO2 = 1 and above about 1500°C, SiO2 is converted to SiC and SiO is gen-
erated by reaction 2.6.5; for aSiO2 = 0.1, reaction 2.6.5 applies only at temperatures above about
1610°C. In the experiments cited,143 the SiO generated by passage of CO through a coke bed at tem-
peratures of 1600 to 1900°C, were found to be close to the equilibrium values for reaction 2.6.5.
Volatile SiS is generated by reactions of the type with the coke ash:
CaS (in coke ash) + SiO ® SiS + CaO
(2.6.6)
FeS (in coke ash) + SiO + C ® SiS + CO + Fe
(2.6.7)
The reaction of these vapor species with metal and slag may be represented by the equations:
(2.6.8)
(2.6.9)
Ozturk and Fruehan,144 in carefully controlled experiments, demonstrated that the rate of the SiO
reactions with metal and slag are controlled by gas phase mass transfer and are rapid.
Coke samples taken from the tuyere zone of the blast furnace usually contain 12 to 16% ash which
has a basicity (CaO + MgO)/SiO2 of about 0.6; for a typical blast furnace slag, the basicity is about
1.5. Therefore, the partial pressures of SiO and sulfur-bearing species in the gas near the coke sur-
face are expected to differ from those interacting with the slag. For the purpose of comparison, cal-
culations are made for assumed local equilibrium at 1500°C for the systems gas-slag and gas-coke
ash; the results are given in Table 2.12. The amount of ash in the tuyere coke and its composition
suggests that, although most of the silica and sulfur in the coke ash are removed from the furnace
by the slag and liquid iron, there is significant recycle of silicon and sulfur in the bosh region by
the vaporization and condensation of these species on the coke particles.

2.6.2.2 Alkali Recycle and Removal by Slag
The alkalies constitute another dominant vapor species in the bosh and stack regions of the blast fur-
nace. Many studies have been made of the alkali recycle in the blast furnace via the process of vapor-
ization and condensation; the subject is well covered in the references cited.145–147 General
consensus evolved from elementary thermodynamic calculations is that the alkali silicates in the ore

and coke ash decompose at elevated temperatures in the lower part of the bosh and the combustion
zone. In part the alkali vapors carried away with the ascending gas react with the slag and can there-
fore be removed from the furnace; part are converted to alkali cyanides and carbonates and
deposited on the burden and the refractory lining of the furnace stack. Some new thoughts are pre-
sented in the following discussion on the sequence of reactions and vapor species that may govern
the alkali recycle in the blast furnace.
As an example, let us calculate the equilibrium vapor pressure of potassium for the reduction reaction:
(K2O) + C = 2K(g) + CO(g)
(2.6.10)
The computed equilibrium values in Table 2.13 are for a blast furnace slag containing 0.5% K2O
and having a basicity of B = 1.5: K is the equilibrium constant for reaction 2.6.10 from the ther-
mochemical data and aK2O is the activity of K2O in the slag, relative to the hypothetical solid K2O,
from the experimental data of Steiler.148
If the potassium input with the blast furnace burden is 4 kg K/t–HM and 80% of it is removed by
the slag, about 0.8 kg K/t–HM will be in the vapor phase carried away by the furnace gas. For a
typical total gas volume of 2300 nm3/t–HM, the partial pressure of the total potassium vapor
species would be 7.2 x 10–4 bar (for a total gas pressure of 3.6 bar in the bosh region). Compari-
son of this total potassium pressure in the gas with those in Table 2.13 for the gas-slag equilibrium
indicates that the slag particles will pick up potassium from the gas only at temperatures below
1200°C. The ash in the coke samples taken from the tuyere zone contains 2 to 4% (Na2O + K2O)
which is several fold of that in the original coke ash. Because of the low basicity of coke ash, the
amount of alkali therein is expected to be 5 to 10 times greater than that found in the slag. In the
upper part of the bosh, the slag and coke will pick up alkalies from the gas. As the temperature of
the slag and coke increases during descent in the bosh, they will emit alkali vapors to the gas phase.
However, the partial pressure of potassium vapor in the gas would probably be below that given in
Table 2.13 for the gas-slag equilibrium. Nevertheless, the numerical examples cited suggest that
much of the alkalies accumulated in the bosh and hearth zone of the blast furnace, via recycling,
are in the gas phase.

According to a mass spectrometric study of vaporization of potassium cyanide by Simmons et.
al,149 the equilibrium pressures of vapor species are in the order p(KCN)2 > p(KCN) > p(KCN)3. For
atmospheric pressure of nitrogen and at graphite saturation, the following are the equilibrium ratios
of the vapor species: at the melting point of KCN (635°C), (KCN)2: KCN : K = 2 : l : 0.76 and at
the boiling point (1132°C), (KCN)2: KCN : K = 4.6: l : 0.19. It is all too clear that (KCN)2 is the
dominant alkali-bearing species in the blast furnace. The sodium in the burden undergoes cyclic
reactions similarly to potassium; however, the concentration of sodium-bearing species are about
one-tenth of the potassium-bearing species.
One method of minimizing the ascent of alkali vapors to the stack, hence reducing the alkali recy-
cle, is by operating the furnace with a slag of low basicity, particularly when the alkali input is high.
The slag of low basicity, however, will have an adverse effect on the composition of the hot metal
produced; it will result in low manganese, high silicon and high sulfur in the metal. For a given
preferred basicity, the slag mass per ton of hot metal may have to be increased when there is an
increase in the alkali input to the furnace. An increase in amount of slag will increase the coke rate,

109
hence will increase the alkali input. Obviously, with a burden of high alkali input, a compromise
has to be made in adjusting slag basicity and slag mass so that the alkali recycle would be low.
Even with a low alkali input some alkali buildup will occur. To prevent excessive accumulation of
alkalies, which lead to scaffolding, gas channeling, furnace upsets and so on, periodic additions of
gravel (silica) or olivine (magnesium silicate) are made to the blast furnace charge. The silica reacts
with alkali carbonates and cyanides, thus facilitates the discharge of the accumulated alkalies from
the furnace by the slag. Practical experience also shows that periodic addition of calcium chloride
to the burden also facilitates the removal of alkalies by the slag.
2.6.2.3 Ammonia and Hydrogen Cyanide in Blast Furnace Stack
The contaminants in the wash water for the iron blast-furnace off-gas are in the ranges 10–300 mg
NH3/l, 1–30 mg CNt (total)/l, and 0.3–15 mg phenols/l. In terms of ppm by volume in the stack
gas, the concentrations are usually in the ranges 3000–4000 ppm NH3 and 150–250 ppm CNt. As
observed by Pociecha and Biczysko,150 for example, most of the cyanide in the de-dusted furnace
off gas is in the form of hydrogen cyanide. They also found that the blast furnace dust contains only
a small amount of solid cyanides (presumably alkali cyanides) in comparison with the amount of
hydrogen cyanide present in the de-dusted top gas. The same contaminants in the ferromanganese
blast furnace off gas are about an order of magnitude greater than those in the iron blast furnace.
The experimental work of Turkdogan and Josephic,151 under conditions partly simulating the blast
furnace stack, substantiated the validity of this mechanism of generation of ammonia and hydro-
gen cyanide in the stack, by the following reactions.
2K(Na)CN + 3H2O = (K, Na)2CO3 + 2NH3 + C
(2.6.11)
NH3 + CO = HCN + H2O
(2.6.12)
The amounts of ammonia and hydrogen cyanide generated will increase with an increase in the
concentration of water vapor in the stack gas. Other reactions will occur with these volatile species
generating some amino-nitro phenols, e.g. NH2(NO2)C6H3OH. The equilibrium concentrations of
these volatile organic species become greater at lower temperatures.
2.6.3 Slag-Metal Reactions in the Blast Furnace
Slag-metal reactions in the hearth of the blast furnace control the chemistry of the hot metal. In
particular, the silicon, sulfur and manganese contents depend upon these reactions. In this section
the equilibrium and reaction mechanisms are presented.
2.6.3.1 Slag-Metal Equilibrium for Blast Furnace Reactions
From the thermodynamics of the slag systems and of the various solutes in iron such as sulfur, sil-
icon and manganese, it is possible to predict the equilibrium relationship for blast furnace reactions.
The three-phase reactions to be considered are for graphite-saturated melts at 1 atm pressure of car-
bon monoxide, which is close to the partial pressure of CO in the blast furnace bosh and hearth zones.
2.6.3.1.1 Silicon Reaction The reaction equilibrium to be considered is
(SiO2) + 2[C] = [Si] + 2CO(g)
(2.6.13)
(2.6.14)
where the SiO2 and C activities are with respect to pure solid silica and graphite, respectively.
The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is from the free energy data

Substituting aSiO2 = (%SiO2)gSiO2/60 ´ 1.65 and for the
activity coefficient fSi = 15 in graphite-saturated iron
containing Si < 2%, the equilibrium metal/slag silicon
distribution ratio is represented by
(2.6.16)
The equilibrium silicon distribution ratios computed
previously, using the gSiO2 values for the blast furnace
type slags (CaO, 10% MgO, 10% Al2O3, SiO2), are
given in Fig. 2.88. The dotted curves are derived from
other data discussed later. For the blast furnace type
slags, the basicity is usually defined by the mass ratio
(%CaO + %Mg)/%SiO2.

Abraham et al.152 measured the MnO activity in CaO–Al2O3–SiO2– MnO melts containing Al2O3
< 20% and MnO < 8%. The values of gMnO derived from their data are seen in Fig. 2.89 to
increase with an increasing slag basicity. The equilibrium manganese distribution ratio for
graphite saturated melts thus evaluated are given in Fig. 2.90.

2.6.3.1.3 Si–Mn Coupled Reaction
The silicon-manganese coupled reaction
2(MnO) + [Si] = (SiO2) + 2[Mn]
(2.6.21)
between graphite-saturated iron and blast furnace type slags has been investigated by several exper-
imental studies.143,153,154
(2.6.22)
The combination of equations 2.6.16 and 2.6.20 gives the following equilibrium constant for reac-
tion (2.6.21) 
The variation of the equilibrium relation KMnSi with slag basicity is shown in Fig. 2.91. The dotted
line for 1400 to 1600°C is calculated from the thermochemical data, i.e. from the computed equi-
librium data in Figs. 2.88 and 2.90. The difference of the calculated equilibrium dotted line from
the average experimental values by a factor of 2.7 (º ~15 kJ) is due to the accumulated uncertain-
ties in the free energy data on MnO and SiO2 as well as DGs for solutions of Mn and Si in
graphite-saturated iron.
The experimental data in Fig. 2.91 for graphite saturated melts at 1400 – 1600°C may be repre-
sented by the following equation.
(2.6.23)
To be consistent with the experimental data in Fig. 2.91, the dotted curves are derived from the reli-
able equilibrium data in Fig. 2.90 and the experimental data represented by equation (2.6.23) for
the Si–Mn coupled reaction in graphite saturated melts.
In a study of slag-metal equilibria between CaO–MnO–SiO2 slags and graphite-saturated man-
ganese-base alloys, Turkdogan and Hancock155 found that the ratios Si/SiO2 and Mn/MnO varied
with slag basicity in a manner similar to that for iron base alloys. Their results for 1400°C are
shown in Fig. 2.92; the dot-dash line is for the iron-base alloys, reproduced from Fig. 2.91.

2.6.3.1.5 Si–Ti Coupled Reaction
Delve et al.156 have studied the silicon-titanium coupled reaction in
graphite-saturated melts using blast furnace type slags:
(TiO2) + [Si] = (SiO2) + [Ti]
(2.6.28)
Their experimental results, for temperatures of 1500 and 1600°C and basicities of 1 to 2, may be
summarized by the following equation.
(2.6.29)
(2.6.30)
2.6.3.2 Mechanisms of Slag-Metal Reactions
2.6.3.2.1 Experimental Work
Experiments were made by the authors143 to simulate the events in
the upper part of the blast furnace hearth where metal droplets pass through the slag layer.
Solid pieces (4 to 5 mm dia.) of graphite-saturated iron containing Si and S were dropped on
the surface of a pool of remelted blast furnace slag (65 g) contained in a graphite tube (20
mm dia.) at 1480°C; an argon atmosphere was maintained over the melt. Twenty pieces of
metal (7 g total) were dropped one at a time at 10–20 s intervals, within 7–10 min total time
of the experiment. The metal pieces melted rapidly and descended a 10 cm deep column of
molten slag as individual metal droplets. After the last piece was dropped the melt was
rapidly cooled. The residence time of the droplets in the slag column is estimated to be about
1–2 s, if there is no appreciable buoyancy effect due to gas evolution. The metal droplets col-
lected in a well at the bottom of the slag column; metal and slag were subsequently analyzed
for manganese, silicon and sulfur.
With the addition of MnO to the slag, there is silicon transfer from metal to slag. As is seen from
the experimental results in Fig. 2.95, the extent of silicon oxidation increases with increasing
%MnO in the slag via the Si–Mn coupled reaction

(2.6.31)
In addition, there is also MnO reduction by carbon in the metal droplets.
(MnO) + [C] ® [Mn] + CO
(2.6.32)
With the slags containing MnO > 3%, the metal droplets desiliconized down to 0.1 – 0.3% Si.
Within this region, the silicon and manganese distribution ratios are within the ranges
(%SiO2)/[%Si] = 120 to 350 and [%Mn]/(%MnO) = 0.7 to 1.8. These ratios give KMnSi values
below the equilibrium value of 1096 derived from equation 2.6.23 for the slag basicity of 1.5.
The effect of MnO content of the slag on the extent of desulfurization of metal droplets during
descent in the slag column is shown in Fig. 2.96. The shaded area within the range 0.010 to
0.035% S corresponds to the state of slag-metal equilibrium represented by equation 2.6.26, for
metal droplets containing 0.1 to 0.3% Si and the slag of basicity 1.5 containing 41% CaO, 35%
SiO2 and 1.5% S.
The extremely fast rates of reactions observed in the foregoing experiments may be attributed to
the presence of a thin gas film (consisting of the vapor species CO, SiO, SiS and Mn) around the
metal droplets, which provides the reaction path for the transfer of reactants to and from slag and
metal via the gas phase.
2.6.3.3 Blast Furnace Tap Chemistry Data
In a previous study157 an assessment was made of the state of slag-metal reactions in the blast fur-
nace hearth from an analysis of the daily average compositions of metal and slag samples as nor-
mally recorded in the plants. The plant data used were those reported by Okabe et al.158 from Chiba
Works of Kawasaki Steel and the daily average data for a period of a month from U.S. Steel plants.
In the plant data used, the melt temperatures at tap are mostly in the range 1500 ± 25°C. The aver-
age slag compositions in mass percent are in the range 38–42% CaO, 8–10% MgO, 34–38% SiO2,
10–12% Al2O3, 0.5–1.0% MnO, 2% S and minor amounts of other oxides. The slag basicity is about

experimental data and the equilibrium relation in Fig. 2.88, i.e. dotted curves. It is only the sili-

ted). It should be pointed out that in the upper part of the slag layer, the iron oxide content will be
higher than manganese oxide. Therefore, the silicon in metal droplets will be oxidized more read-
ily by iron oxide in the upper part of the slag layer, resulting in the observed non-equilibrium state
for the Si–Mn coupled reaction in equation 2.6.31.
With iron ore of low basicity in the blast furnace burden, the slag basicity will be low and fur-
thermore, the iron oxide content in the upper part of the slag layer is expected to be higher. It is

presumably for this reason that a low slag basicity, the KMnSi values are much lower than the equi-
librium values for the Si–Mn couple reaction.
In an earlier study of plant data from a ferromanganese blast furnace in the UK,160 it was found
that there were departures from equilibrium for the Si oxidation by MnO in the slag in a manner
similar to that observed for the iron blast furnace.
The plant data in Fig. 2.99 for the sulfur distribution ratio are scattered about the equilibrium line
for the Mn–S coupled reaction at 1500°C, represented by equation 2.6.27. However, the ratios

(%S)/[%S] in the plant data are lower than the equilibrium values for the Si–S coupled reaction
represented by equation 2.6.26. Nevertheless, despite departures from equilibrium, the silicon and
sulfur contents of the blast furnace iron change in a systematic manner, i.e. high silicon/low sulfur
and low silicon/high sulfur.
It should be borne in mind that because of fluctuations in the operating conditions in the blast fur-
nace, there will be variations in temperature and the extent of reaction of metal droplets during
descent through the slag layer. Consequently, the metal droplets of varying composition collecting
in the stagnant hearth will bring about the composition and temperature stratification that is com-
mon to all blast furnaces.
2.7 Fundamentals of Steelmaking Reactions
The oxygen steelmaking and electric-arc furnace steelmaking processes are described in detail
in Chapters 9 and 10 respectively. The practical and technical aspects of the steel refining in the
ladle furnace and vacuum degassing are described in Chapter 11. In this section of Chapter 2, the
discussion of steelmaking reactions will be confined to an assessment of the reaction mechanisms
and the state of slag-metal reactions at the time of furnace tapping.

2.7.1 Slag-Metal Equilibrium in Steelmaking 
The reaction equilibria in the liquid steel-slag systems have been extensively studied, both experi-
mentally and theoretically by applying the principles of thermodynamics and physical chemistry.
In a recent reassessment of the available experimental data on steel-slag reactions103, it became evi-
dent that the equilibrium constants of slag-metal reactions vary with the slag composition in dif-
ferent ways, depending on the type of reaction. For some reactions the slag basicity is the key
parameter to be considered; for another reaction the key parameter could be the mass concentra-
tion of either the acidic or basic oxide components of the slag.
2.7.1.1  Oxidation of Iron
In steelmaking slags, the total number of g-mols of oxides per 100 g of slag is within the range
1.65 ± 0.05. Therefore, the analysis of the slag-metal equilibrium data, in terms of the activity and
mol fraction of iron oxide, can be transposed to a simple relation between the mass ratio
[ppm O]/(%FeO) and the sum of the acidic oxides %SiO2 + 0.84 ´ %P2O5 as depicted in Fig.
2.100(a). The experimental data used in the diagram are those cited in Ref. 103. There is of course
a corollary relation between the ratio [ppm O]/(%FeO) and the slag basicity as shown in Fig.
2.100(b).

2.7.1.2 Oxidation of Manganese
For the FeO and MnO exchange reaction involving the oxidation of manganese in steel, formulated
below,
(FeO) + [Mn] = (MnO) + [Fe]
(2.7.1)
the equilibrium relation may be described in terms of the mass concentrations of oxides
(2.7.2)
where the equilibrium relation K¢FeMn
depends on temperature and slag
composition. 
The values of K¢FeMn derived from
the equilibrium constant for reaction
2.7.1, given in Ref. 27 and the activ-
ity coefficient ratios gFeO/gMnO in Fig.
2.67, are plotted in Fig. 2.101 against
the slag basicity. In BOF, OBM(Q-
BOP) and EAF steelmaking, the slag
basicities are usually in the range 2.5
to 4.0 and the melt temperature in
the vessel at the time of furnace tap-
ping in most practices is between
1590 and 1630°C for which the equi-
librium K¢FeMn is 1.9 ± 0.3. The plant
analytical data for tap samples give
K¢FeMn values that are scattered about
the indicated slag-metal equilibrium
values.
Morales and Fruehan161 have recently
determined experimentally the equi-
librium constant K¢FeMn for reaction
2.7.1 using MgO-saturated calcium
silicate melts. Their values of K¢FeMn
are plotted in Fig. 2.102 together with
some data from the studies of Chip-
man et al.162 and Suito et al.163. The
broken line curve is reproduced from
Fig. 2.101. Resolution of observed
differences in the values of K¢FeMn
awaits future studies.
2.7.1.3 Oxidation of Carbon

For 1600°C, g FeO = 1.3 at slag basicity of B = 3.2 and pCO = 1.5 atm (average CO pressure in the
vessel), we obtain the following equilibrium relation between the carbon content of steel and the
iron oxide content of slag.
2.7.1.4 Oxidation of Chromium
There are two valencies of chromium (Cr2+ and Cr3+) dissolved in the slag. The ratio Cr2+/Cr3+
increases with an increasing temperature, decreasing oxygen potential and decreasing slag basic-
ity. Under steelmaking conditions, i.e. in the basic slags and at high oxygen potentials, the triva-
lent chromium predominates in the slag. The equilibrium distribution of chromium between slag
and metal for basic steelmaking slags, determined by various investigators, is shown in Fig. 2.103;
slope of the line represents an average of these data.

2.7.1.5 Oxidation of Phosphorus
It was in the late 1960s that the correct formulation of the phosphorus reaction was at last realized, thus

At low concentrations of [P] and [O], as in most of the experimental melts, their activity coeffi-
cients are close to unity, therefore mass concentrations can be used in formulating the equilibrium
relation KPO for the above reaction.
(2.7.9)
The equilibrium relation KPO, known as the phosphate capacity of the slag, depends on tempera-
ture and slag composition.
From a reassessment of all the available experimental data, discussed in detail in Ref. 103, it was con-
cluded that CaO and MgO components of the slag, had the strongest effect on the phosphate capac-
ity of the slag. Over a wide range of slag composition and for temperatures of 1550 to 1700°C, the
steel-slag equilibrium with respect to the phosphorus reaction may be represented by the equation
(2.7.10)
where BO = %CaO + 0.3 (%MgO).
2.7.1.6 Reduction of Sulfur
The sulfur transfer from metal to slag is a reduction process as represented by this equation

As is seen from the plots in Fig. 2.104, the sulfide capacities of slags, KSO, measured in three inde-
pendent studies are in general accord. The effect of temperature on KSO is masked by the scatter in
the data. The concentration of acidic oxides, e.g. %SiO2 + 0.84 ´ %P2O5, rather than the slag basic-
ity seems to be better representation of the dependence of KSO on the slag composition.
2.7.2 State of Reactions in Steelmaking
There are numerous versions of oxygen steelmaking such as top blowing (BOF, BOP, LD, etc.),
bottom blowing (OBM, Q-BOP, etc.) and combined blowing (K-OBM, LBE, etc.); these are
described in detail in Chapter 10. The state of the refining reactions depend to some degree on the
process. Bottom blowing in general provides better slag-metal mixing and reactions are closer to
equilibrium. In the following section the state of reactions for top blowing (BOF) and bottom blow-
ing (OBM) is given. The state of reactions for combined or mixed blowing processes would be
between these two limiting cases. The analytical plant data used in this study were on samples
taken from the vessel at first turndown from the BOP and Q-BOP shops of U.S. Steel. These plant
data were acquired through the kind collaboration of the USS research personnel at the Technical
Center.
2.7.2.1 Decarburization and FeO Formation
The most important reaction in steelmaking is decarburization. It not only determines the process
time but also the FeO content of the slag, affecting yield and refining. When oxygen is injected into
an oxygen steelmaking furnace a tremendous quantity of gas is evolved, forming a gas-metal-slag
emulsion which is three to four times greater in volume than the non-emulsified slag and metal.
The chemical reactions take place between the metal droplets, the slag and gas in the emulsion.
These reactions have been observed in the laboratory using x-ray techniques indicating in many
cases, the gas phase (primarily CO) separates the slag and metal, and that gaseous intermediates
play a role in decarburization.

When oxygen first contacts a liquid iron-carbon alloy it initially reacts with iron according to reaction
2.7.13, even though thermodynamically it favors its reaction with carbon. This is due to the relative
abundance of iron in comparison to carbon. Carbon in the liquid metal then diffuses to the interface
reducing the FeO by reaction 2.7.14. The net reaction is the oxidation of carbon, reaction 2.7.15.
Fe + 1/2O2 = FeO
(2.7.13)
FeO + C = CO + Fe
(2.7.14)
C + 1/2O2 = CO
(2.7.15)
However, carbon is only oxidized as fast as it can be transferred to the surface.
At high carbon contents the rate of mass transfer is high such that most of the FeO formed is
reduced and the rate of decarburization is controlled by the rate of oxygen supply:
(2.7.16)

the molecular weight of carbon (12),
W
=
the weight of steel,
f
=
the fraction of the product gas which is CO; the remainder is CO2 and f is
close to unity (0.8 to 1).
Below a critical carbon content the rate of mass transfer is insufficient to react with all the injected
oxygen. In this case the rate of decarburization is given by168:
(2.7.17)
where

the equlibrium carbon with the slag for reaction 2.7.14 and is close to zero,
mi
=
the mass transfer coefficient for the specific reaction site,
Ai
=
the metal-FeO surface area for the specific reaction site.
For top blown processes the reaction takes place between the metal droplets ejected into the emul-
sion and the FeO in the slag. For bottom blowing there is less of an emulsion and the reaction takes
place at the interface of the metal bath and the rising bubbles which have FeO associated with
them. The critical carbon is when the rates given by 2.7.16 and 2.7.17 are equal and is typically
about 0.3% C.
The actual values of mi and Aiare not known, consequently an overall decarburization constant (kC)
can be defined and the rate below the critical carbon content is given by 2.7.19 and 2.7.20:
(2.7.18)

or, 
(2.7.20)
where tc is the time at which the critical carbon content is obtained. The equilibrium carbon con-
tent (%Ce) is close to zero. However in actual steelmaking there is a practical limit of about 0.01
to 0.03 for %Ce.

The value of kC increases with the blowing rate since the amount of ejected droplets and bubbles
increases. Also, kc decreases with the amount of steel, (W), as indicated by 2.7.19. In actual
processes, the blowing rate is proportional to the weight of steel and , therefore, kC has similar val-
ues in most oxygen steelmaking operations. For top blowing, kC is about 0.015 s–1 and for bottom
blowing 0.017 s–1. The values of the critical carbon content are also similar ranging from 0.2 to
0.4% C. The rate of decarburization for a typical steelmaking process is shown in Fig. 2.105. At
the initial stage when silicon is being oxidized, which will be discussed later, the rate of decarbur-
ization is low. The value of kC is higher for bottowm blowing because mixing is more intensive and
the reaction occurs at the interface of the rising bubbles as well as the slag-metal emulsion.
Below the critical carbon content, when the rate of mass transfer of carbon is insufficient to reduce
all of the FeO formed and, therefore, the FeO content of the slag increases rapidly. In actual
processes, initially, some FeO forms because it has a low activity in the slag resulting in about 5-
10 % FeO in the slag. The FeO remains constant until the critical carbon content and then the FeO
increases rapidly. The amount of FeO can be computed from a mass balance for oxygen. Specifi-
cally the oxgyen not used for carbon, silicon or manganese oxidizes iron to FeO. The moles of FeO
in the slag at anytime (NFeO) is given by:
(2.7.21)
where NSi
O2 and NMn
O2 are the moles of oxygen consumed in oxidizing Si and Mn. Since the rate of
decarburizaiton is slightly higher for bottom and mixed blowing these processes have lower FeO
contents.
At all levels of turndown carbon, the iron oxide content of BOF slag is about twice that of OBM
(Q-BOP) slag (Fig. 2.106). The dotted line depicts the slag-metal equilibrium value of
(%FeO)[%C] » 1.25.
As depicted in Fig. 2.107, the square root correlation also applies to the product (%FeO)[%C] for
low carbon contents, with marked departure form this empirical correlation at higher carbon con-
tents. The slopes of the lines for low carbon contents are given below.

2.7.2.2 Oxygen-Carbon Relation
Noting from the plot in Fig. 2.108, there is an interesting correlation between the product [ppm O]
[%C] and the carbon content of the steel. The square root correlation holds up to about 0.05% C
in BOF and up to 0.08% C in OBM(Q-BOP) steelmaking. At low carbon contents, the oxygen con-
tent of steel in the BOF practice is higher than that in OBM steelmaking. For carbon contents above
0.15% the product [ppm O] [%C] is essentially constant at about 30 ± 2, which is the equilibrium
value for an average gas (CO) bubble pressure of about 1.5 atmosphere in the steel bath.
At low carbon levels in the melt near the end of the blow, much of the oxygen is consumed by the
oxidation of iron, manganese and phosphorus, resulting in a lower volume of CO generation. With
the bottom injection of argon in the BOF combined-blowing practice, and the presence of hydro-
gen in the gas bubbles in OBM, the partial pressure of CO in the gas bubbles will be lowered in
both processes when the rate of CO generation decreases. A decrease in the CO partial pressure
at low carbon contents will be greater in OBM than in BOF practices, because the hydrogen con-
tent of gas bubbles in OBM is greater than the argon content of gas bubbles in BOF. It is pre-
sumably for this reason that the concentration product [O][C] in OBM steelmaking is lower than
in the BOF combined-blowing practice, particularly at low carbon levels.

the SiO2 reacts with the CaO to form the slag.
Si + 1/2O2 = (SiO2)
(2.7.26)
The thermodynamics of the reaction indicate virtually all of the Si is oxidized. The rate is con-
trolled by liquid phase mass transfer, represented by the following equation: 
(2.7.27)
where
mSi
= mass transfer coefficient for silicon,
%Sie
= the silicon content in the metal in equilibrium with the slag and is
close to zero.
As with decarburization, an overall rate parameter for Si can be defined, kSi, similar to kC. Within
our ability to estimate kSi it is about equal to kC since A, W, and are the same and mass transfer
coefficients vary only as the diffusivity to the one half power. Therefore 2.7.27 simplifies to:
(2.7.28)
where %Si° is the initial silicon and kSi is the overall constant for Si and is approximately equal to
kC. The rate for Si oxidadtion is shown in Fig. 2.105.

It is seen that the concentration ratios of the reactants in low carbon steel describing the states of
oxidation of iron and manganese, are scattered about the values for the slag-metal equilibrium.
However, as indicated by the plant data in Fig. 2.108, the oxidation of iron and manganese are in
the non-equilibrium states for high carbon contents in the steel at turndown. Although the concen-
tration product [O][C] is close to the equilibrium value for an average CO pressure of about 1.5
atm in the steel bath, the concentrations of iron oxide and manganese oxide in the slag are above
the equilibrium values for high carbon contents in the melt.
It is concluded from these observations that:
(i) at low carbon contents the equilibrium state of iron and manganese oxidation con-
trols the concentration of dissolved oxygen
(ii) at high carbon contents it is the CO–C–O equilibrium which controls the oxygen
content of the steel.

2.7.2.6  State of Phosphorus Reaction
The slag/metal phosophorus distribution
ratios at first turndown in BOF and OBM
(Q-BOP) steelmaking are plotted in Fig.
2.109 against the carbon content of the steel.
The plant data are for the turndown temper-
atures of 1610 ± 20°C and slags containing
50 ± 2% CaO and 6 ± 2% MgO. The shaded
area is for the slag-metal equilibrium for the
above stated conditions in OBM(Q-BOP),
based on the empirical [O][C] relations, i.e.
for C < 0.08%, [ppm O] Ï%
wCw = 80 and for
C > 0.15%, [ppm O][%C] = 30.
Noting that the oxygen contents of the steel
at low carbon levels are greater in BOF
steelmaking, the equilibrium phosphorus
distribution ratios will likewise be greater
in BOF than in (OBM) Q-BOP steelmaking.
For example, at 0.05% C and about 600 ppm
O in BOF at turndown the average equilib-
rium value of (%P)/[%P] is about 200 at
1610°C, as compared to the average value
of 60 in OBM(Q-BOP) at 0.05% C with
about 360 ppm O.
Below 0.04% C the phosphorus distribution ratios in OBM(Q-BOP) are in general accord with the
values for slag-metal equilibrium. However, at higher carbon contents the ratios (%P)/[%P] are
well above the equilibrium values. In the case of BOF steelmaking below 0.1% C at turndown, the
ratios (%P)/[%P] are much lower than the equilibrium values. On the other hand, at higher carbon
contents the phosphorus distribution ratios are
higher than the equilibrium values as in the case
of OBM(Q-BOP).
The effect of temperature on the phosphorus dis-
tribution ratio in OBM(Q-BOP) is shown in Fig.
2.110 for melts containing 0.014% to 0.022% C
with BO = 52 ± 2% in the slag.
2.7.2.7 State of Sulfur Reaction
A highly reducing condition that is required for
extensive desulfurization of steel is opposite to the
oxidizing condition necessary for steel making.
However, some desulfurization is achieved during
oxygen blowing for decarburization and dephos-
phorization. As seen from typical examples of the
BOF and OBM(Q-BOP) plant data in Fig. 2.111,
the state of steel desulfurization at turndown,
described by the expression [%O](%S)/[%S], is
related to the SiO2 and P2O5 contents of the slag.
Most of the points for OBM(Q-BOP) are within
the hatched area for the slag-metal equilibrium
reproduced from Fig. 2.104. However, in the case
of BOF steelmaking the slag/metal sulfur distrib-
ution ratios at turndown are about one-third or

At higher carbon contents, e.g. C > 0.1%, the
sulfur distribution ratios in both processes are
below the slag-metal equilibrium values.
2.7.2.8 Hydrogen in BOF and OBM(Q-BOP)
Steelmaking
Hydrogen and nitrogen are removed from the
steel bath during oxygen blowing by CO car-
rying off H2 and N2.
2H(in steel) ® H2(g)
(2.7.31)
2N(in steel) ® N2(g)
(2.7.32)
There is however continuous entry of both
hydrogen and nitrogen into the bath by various
means. In both BOF and OBM(Q-BOP) there is
invariably some leakage of water from the water
cooling system of the hood into the vessel. In
the case of OBM(Q-BOP), the natural gas
(CH4) used as a tuyere coolant is a major source
of hydrogen.
The hydrogen content of steel in the tap ladle, measured by a probe called HYDRIS, is less than 5
ppm in BOF steelmaking and 6 to 10 ppm H in OBM(Q-BOP) steelmaking. Because natural gas
(CH4) is used as a tuyere coolant in the OBM, the hydrogen content of steel made in this vessel is
always higher than that in the BOF vessel. In both practices the re-blow will always increase the
hydrogen content of the steel. A relatively small volume of CO evolved during the re-blow cannot
overcome the hydrogen pickup from various sources.
2.7.2.9 The Nitrogen Reaction
As demonstrated, the decarburization reaction is reasonably well understood as well as the slag-
metal re-fining reactions which approach equilibrium. The removal of nitrogen is complex and
depends on numerous operating variables. With the advent of the production of high purity inter-
stitial free (IF) steels the control of nitrogen has become of great importance. For years there have
been “rules of thumb” for achieving low nitrogen. For example, using more hot metal and less
scrap in the charge or with combined blowing processes, switching the stirring gas from nitrogen
to argon have resulted in lower nitrogen contents.
The sources of nitrogen in oxygen steelmaking include the hot metal, scrap, impurity nitrogen in
the oxygen, and nitrogen in the stirring gas. Nitrogen from the atmosphere is not a major factor
unless at first turndown a correction or reblow is required, in which case the furnace fills up with
air which is entrained into the metal when the oxygen blow restarts, resulting in a significant nitro-
gen pickup of 5 to 10 ppm. 
Goldstein and Fruehan169 developed a comprehensive model to predict the nitrogen reaction in
steelmaking. Nitrogen is removed by diffusing to the CO bubbles in the emulsion,or to the bubbles
in the bath in bottom blowing. The nitrogen atoms combine to form N2, the rate of which is con-
trolled by chemical kinetics and the nitrogen gas is removed with the CO bubbles. Both mass trans-
fer and chemical kinetics contribute to the overall rate of removal.
N(metal) = N(surface)
(2.7.33)
2N(surface) = N2
(2.7.34)
The mixed control model presented previously is the basis for the model. There are, however, sev-
eral complications. For example, all of the rate parameters are functions of temperature. The sulfur

content of the metal changes with time and the oxygen content at the surface is considerably dif-
ferent from the bulk concentration. Consequently the temperature and surface contents of oxygen
and sulfur must be known as functions of time. Also, scrap is melting during the process changing
the composition of the metal. These details are dealt with and discussed in detail elsewhere.169
An example of the results of the model calculations are shown in Fig. 2.112 and Fig. 2.113. In Fig.
2.112 the nitrogen contents are shown for two hypothetical cases for a 200 ton oxygen steelmaking con-
verter blowing oxygen at 800 Nm3/min. In one case the charge contains 80% heavy scrap, 16 cm thick
containing 50 ppm nitrogen; in the second case there is no scrap but cooling is achieved by the use of
a 15% addition of DRI containing 20 ppm nitrogen. For the case of the heavy scrap, it melts late in the
process releasing its nitrogen after most of the CO is generated, causing the nitrogen content to increase
to 30 ppm at the end of the blow. With no scrap the final nitrogen is significantly lower at 20 ppm. The
model also indicates if ore, which has no nitrogen, is used for cooling, levels of 10 ppm nitrogen can
be obtained. In comparing the bulk and surface nitrogen contents, it is found that the surface concen-
tration is only slightly less than the bulk, indicating that the nitrogen reaction is primarily controlled by
chemical kinetics. In particular, towards the end of the blow the oxygen content at the surface is high,
retarding the rate. This model is useful for optimizing the process for nitrogen control. For example,
the effect of oxygen purity, the time of switching the stirring gas from N2 to argon, the metal sulfur
content and the amount and size of scrap can be determined. The effect of switching the stirring gas
from N2 to Ar is shown in Fig. 2.113.
2.7.2.10 General Considerations
The analyses of plant data on slag and metal samples taken at first turndown have revealed that
there are indeed equilibrium and non-equilibrium states of reactions in oxygen steelmaking. In all
the reactions considered, the carbon content of steel is found to have a decisive effect on the state
of slag-metal reactions.

Considering the highly dynamic nature of steelmaking with oxygen blowing and the completion of
the process in less than 20 minutes, it is not surprising that the slag-metal reactions are in the non-
equilibrium states in heats with high carbon contents at turndown. With regard to low carbon heats
all the slag-metal reactions are close to the equilibrium states in bottom blown processes. In the
case of BOF steelmaking however, the states of steel dephosphorization and desulfurization are
below the expected levels for slag-metal equilibrium. As we all recognize it is of course the bottom
injection of lime, together with oxygen, that brings about a closer approach to the slag-metal equi-
librium in OBM(Q-BOP) as compared to the BOF practice, particularly in low carbon heats.
2.8 Fundamentals of Reactions in Electric Furnace Steelmaking
The EAF process is described in detail in Chapter 10. The slag-metal equilibrium for EAF refining
reactions are similar to those for oxygen steelmaking discussed in detail in Section 2.7. The state of
reactions in EAF steelmaking are similar but, in general, are slightly further from equilibrium due to
less stirring and slag-metal mixing as compared to oxygen steelmaking. In this section, the slags and
the state of the carbon, sulfur and phosphorous reactions are briefly discussed. The nitrogen reaction
is considerably different and , along with control of residuals, is more critical and consequently is dis-
cussed in more detail.
2.8.1 Slag Chemistry and the Carbon, Manganese, Sulfur and Phosphorus
Reactions in the EAF
The state of slag-metal reactions at the time of furnace tapping discussed here is based on about fifty
heats acquired from EAF steelmaking plants. The data considered are for the grades of low alloy
steels containing 0.05 to 0.20% C and 0.1 to 0.3% Mn plus small amounts of alloying elements.

The iron oxide, silica and calcium oxide contents of slags are within the hatched areas shown in Fig.
2.114. The silica contents are slightly higher than those in oxygen steelmaking slags. On the other hand
the CaO contents of EAF slags are about 10% lower than those in the BOF slags. This difference is due
to the higher concentrations of Al2O3, Cr2O3 and TiO2 in the EAF slags; 4 to 12% Al2O3, 1 to 4% Cr2O3
and 0.2 to 1.0% TiO2. In these slags the basicity ratio B is about 2.5 at 10% FeO, increasing to about 4
at 40% FeO.
As is seen from the plant data within the
hatched area in Fig. 2.115, the iron oxide con-
tents of EAF slags are much higher than those
of the BOF slags for the same carbon content
at tap. However, the product [%C][ppm O] at
tap is about 26 ± 2 which is slightly lower than
that for oxygen steelmaking.
For the slag-metal reaction involving [Mn],
(FeO) and (MnO), the equilibrium relation
K¢FeMn = (%MnO)/(FeO)[%Mn] is 1.8 ± 0.2 at
1625 ± 15°C and the basicity B > 2.5. The
EAF data are scattered about K¢FeMn = 1.8 ±
0.4, which is near enough to the slag-metal
equilibrium similar to those in oxygen steel-
making.
For steels containing 0.07 to 0.09% C in the
furnace at tap, the estimated dissolved oxy-
gen contents will be about 370 to 290 ppm O.
For slags containing 38–42% CaO and 5–7% MgO, the equilibrium constant KPO for the phospho-
rus reaction, given in equations 2.7.10, is in the range 2.57 ´ 104 to 4.94 ´ 104 at 1625°C. For the
tap carbon contents and slag composition ratios will be in the range 4 to 13. The EAF plant data
show ratios (%P)/[%P] from 15 to 30. Similar to the behavior in BOF steelmaking, the state of
phosphorus oxidation to the slag in EAF steelmaking is greater than would be anticipated from the
equilibrium considerations for carbon, hence oxygen contents of the steel at tap.

The state of steel desulfurization, repre-
sented by the product {(%S)/[%S]} ´
(%FeO), decreases with increasing con-
tents of SiO2 and P2O5 in the slag, as
shown in Fig. 2.116. The EAF plant data
within the shaded area are below the val-
ues for the slag-metal equilibrium. This
non-equilibrium state of the sulfur reac-
tion in EAF steelmaking is similar to that
observed in BOF steelmaking.
General indications are that the states of
slag-metal reactions at tap in EAF steel-
making are similar to those noted in oxy-
gen steelmaking at carbon contents above
0.05% C. That is, the slag/metal distribu-
tion ratio of manganese and chromium are
scattered about the equilibrium values;
the phosphorus and sulfur reactions being
in non-equilibrium states. Also, the iron
oxide content of the slag is well above the
slag-metal equilibrium values for carbon
contents of steel at tap. On the other hand,
the product [%C][ppm O] = 26 ± 2 approximately corresponds to the C–O equilibrium value for
gas bubble pressures of 1.3 ± 0.2 atm in the EAF steel bath.
2.8.2 Control of Residuals in EAF Steelmaking
The growth of EAF steelmaking in the 1990’s was in the production of higher grades of steel,
including flat rolled and special bar quality steels. These steels require lower residuals (Cu, Ni, Sn,
Mo, etc.) than merchant long products normally produced from scrap in an EAF. It is possible to
use high quality scrap such as prompt industrial scrap, but this is expensive and not always avail-
able. The solution to the problem is the use of direct reduced iron such as DRI, HBI, iron carbide
or other scrap substitutes such as pig iron.
The control of residuals in EAF steelmaking is based on a simple mass balance. Residual elements
such as copper will report almost entirely to the steel. The control of residuals can be demonstrated
in a very simple example. Consider the copper content of steel produced from two grades of scrap,
Number 1 bundles and shredded scrap, and DRI/HBI. It is critical to know the yield of each charge
material and its copper content, which is not always easy to assess accurately. There are also sec-
ondary effects such as increased slag levels. Nevertheless, this simple example demonstrates the gen-
eral concepts.

2.8.3 Nitrogen Control in EAF Steelmaking
The nitrogen content of steels produced in the EAF is generally higher than in oxygen steelmak-
ing primarily because there is considerably less CO evolution, which removes nitrogen from steel.
The usual methods of controlling nitrogen are by carbon oxidation and the use of direct reduced
iron or pig iron. The control of nitrogen in the EAF is discussed in recent publications by Gold-
stein and Fruehan.170,171 They developed a model to predict the rate of nitrogen removal similar to
the one presented earlier for oxygen steelmaking. The removal of nitrogen is shown for a 100 ton
EAF as a function of oxygen usage in Fig. 2.117. Nitrogen removal decreases once the carbon con-
tent falls below approximately 0.3%C, as most of the oxygen is then reacting with Fe and is there-
fore not producing CO. Starting at a higher initial carbon allows for more CO evolution and
reduces the activity of oxygen, which retards the rate of the nitrogen reaction.
The other method of reducing nitrogen is the use of DRI or HBI. These materials reduce nitrogen
primarily through dilution. There was a belief that the CO evolved from these products also
removed nitrogen. However it has been demonstrated that the CO evolved from the reaction of C
and FeO in the HBI/DRI is evolved at lower temperatures (1000°C) and is released while heating
or in the slag phase. Since it does not pass through the metal it does not remove nitrogen. The CO
does dilute any N2 in the furnace atmosphere.
The nitrogen removal using 25% and 50% DRI/HBI is shown in Fig. 2.118. The primary effect is
simple dilution.

2.9 Fundamentals of Stainless Steel Production
There are numerous processes to produce stainless steel including the AOD (argon oxygen decar-
burization), VOD (vacuum oxygen decarburization), and other variations of these processes. All of
the processes are based on the reduction of the CO pressure to promote the oxidation of carbon in
preference to chromium. The processes and reactions are described in detail in Chapter 12. This
section will be limited to the reaction mechanisms and fundamentals of decarburization, nitrogen
control and slag reduction.
2.9.1 Decarburization of Stainless Steel
Stainless steels can not be easily produced in an EAF or oxygen steelmaking converter as under
normal conditions Cr will be readily oxidized in preference to C at low carbon contents. This leads
to excessive Cr yield loss and necessitates the use of high cost low carbon ferrochrome rather than
lower cost high carbon ferrochrome.
The critical carbon content at which Cr is oxidized rather than carbon can be computed based on
the following reaction:
Cr2O3 + 3C = 3CO + 2Cr
(2.9.1)
The equilibrium constant is given by:
(2.9.2)
where fC is the activity coefficient of carbon
and ai is the activity of species i. The reac-
tion could be written in terms of Cr3O4 and
the results would be similar. In Fig. 2.119
the equilibrium for reaction 2.9.1 is given as
a function of pCO for an 18% Cr steel.
The critical carbon content is defined as
the carbon content below which Cr is
oxidized. The critical carbon increases
with chromium content or activity (aCr2/3)
and decreasing temperature. 
However decarburization in stainless
steelmaking is not controlled by equilib-
rium but rather reaction kinetics. It was
found that for the AOD process to be
effective the gas had to be injected deep
in the steel bath. Fruehan172 demon-
strated in laboratory experiments that
when oxygen is injected into an Fe–Cr–C
bath the oxygen initially oxidizes Cr.
This lead to the following reaction mech-
anism and model for decarburization.
When oxygen initially contacts an Fe–Cr–C bath it primarily oxidizes Cr to Cr2O3. As the chrome
oxide particles rise through the bath with the gas bubbles, carbon diffuses to the surface and reduces
the oxide according to the reaction 2.9.1. The rate of the reaction is controlled by mass transfer of
carbon. The reaction also takes place with the top slag. The rate equation can be expressed as:

Ai are the surface areas, %Ci
e is the equilibrium carbon content, and the subscript i refers to the
individual reaction sites such as the rising bubble and the top slag.
The equilibrium carbon content is determined from the equilibrium for reaction 2.9.1 which is a
function of temperature, chromium content and local CO pressure. The CO pressure in turn
depends on the rate of decarburization and the Ar or N2 in the gas and the total pressure. The details
of the calculation are given elsewhere.
Equation 2.9.3 is valid when mass transfer of carbon is limiting. At high carbon contents mass
transfer of carbon is sufficient to consume all the oxygen and the rate of decarburization is simply
given by the mass balance based on oxygen flow rate.
The Cr loss to the slag can be computed from the mass balance for oxygen and is given by

Simplified calculations for the rates
of decarburization and Cr oxidation
of an 18–8 stainless steel are pre-
sented in Fig. 2.120 and Fig. 2.121.
These calculations indicate that
switching the O2/Ar ratio at 0.4% C
slightly increases the rate of decar-
burization but significantly reduces
Cr oxidation.
This model is the basis of process
control models for the AOD, VOD

2.9.2 Nitrogen Control in the AOD
It is desirable to use nitrogen (N2) in the AOD in place of Ar because of its lower cost. Also, for
some steels it is desirable to alloy nitrogen by blowing N2 gas. A model for nitrogen control was
developed by one of the authors based on fundamental principles and is briefly described below. 
The nitrogen control model presented here is based on the mixed control model for chemical kinet-
ics and mass transfer in series given in section 2.2.4. Equation 2.9.5 requires knowledge of the
pressure of N2 which is given by
(2.9.5)
where

The rate of CO evolution is determined by the rate of decarburization, equations 2.9.3 and 2.9.4, and
consequently it is necessary to include the decarburization model given in the previous section.
The rate of dissociation of N2 depends on the Cr and S contents. Glaws and Fruehan173 measured
the rate for Fe–Cr–Ni–S alloys and found that Cr increased the rate while sulfur decreased the rate.
The mass transfer parameter can be estimated from basic principles but requires knowledge of the
bubble size; alternatively, it can be determined with a limited quantity of plant data by determin-
ing the best value of mA, the mass transfer coefficient times the surface area. Basic principles can
be used to estimate m reasonably accurately using equations 2.2.74 and 2.2.75, thereby allowing
for an estimation of A. Results of the model are presented in Fig. 2.122 and 2.123.

2.9.3  Reduction of Cr from Slag
In stainless steel production some chromium is oxidized to slag, approximately 3% for an 18% Cr
steel. It is necessary to recover this Cr by adding a reductant, usually Si, (as ferrosilicon) or alu-
minum, which reacts with Cr2O3. For example, for Si the reaction is given by
3Si + 2(Cr2O3) = 3(SiO2) + 4Cr
(2.9.6)
The equilibrium distribution of chromium between slag and metal is given in Fig. 2.124 as a func-
tion of Si content and slag chemistry. From Fig. 2.124 and a mass balance from reaction 2.9.6, it
is possible to compute the Si required for the desired Cr reduction. 
The typical compositions of AOD slags after decarburization and after silicon reduction are given
in Table 2.14. As is seen from the experimental data in Fig. 2.124, the higher the slag basicity and
higher the silicon content of steel, the lower is the equilibrium slag/metal distribution of chromium,
i.e. the greater the chromium recovery from the slag.

2.10 Fundamentals of Ladle Metallurgical Reactions
Several books and conferences have been devoted to ladle or secondary metallurgy. The processes
and fundamentals are described in detail in Chapter 11. In this section only the fundamentals of
deoxidation, desulfurization and inclusion modification are discussed.
2.10.1  Deoxidation Equilibrium and Kinetics
There are primarily three elements used in steel deoxidation:
(l) Mn as low or high C ferro alloy,
(2) Si as low or high C ferro alloy or as silico manganese alloy, 
(3) Al of approximately 98% purity.
2.10.1.1 Deoxidation with Fe/Mn
When the steel is partially deoxidized with Mn, the iron also participates in the reaction, forming
liquid or solid Mn(Fe)O as the deoxidation product.
(2.10.1)
The state of equilibrium of steel with the deoxidation product Mn(Fe)O is shown in Fig. 2.215.
2.10.1.2  Deoxidation with Si/Mn
Depending on the concentrations of Si and Mn added to steel in the tap ladle, the deoxidation prod-
uct will be either molten manganese silicate or solid silica.

From the experimental work of various investigators174–176 the following equilibrium relation is
obtained for the Si/Mn deoxidation reaction.
[Si] + 2(MnO) = 2[Mn] + (SiO2)
(2.10.3)
(2.10.4)
(2.10.5)
where the oxide activities are relative to pure solid oxides. For high concentrations of silicon (>
0.4%) the activity coefficient fSi should be used in the above equation, thus log fSi = 0.11 ´ %Si. 
The activities of MnO in manganese silicate melts have been measured by Rao and Gaskell.177 Their
results are in substantial agreement with the results of the earlier work by Abraham et al.152 The
activity of the oxides (relative to solid oxides) are plotted in Fig. 2.126. For liquid steel containing
Mn < 0.4% the deoxidation product is a MnO-rich silicate with FeO < 8%; therefore the activity data
in Fig. 2.126 can be used together with equation 2.10.4 in computing the equilibrium state of the
Si/Mn deoxidation as given in Fig. 2.127. The deoxidation product being either solid silica or molten
manganese silicate depends on temperature, Si and Mn contents, as shown in Fig. 2.127.

At silica saturation, the deoxidation is by silicon alone, for which the equilibrium relation for unit
SiO2 activity is reduced to
(2.10.6)
2.10.1.3 Deoxidation with Si/Mn/Al
Semi-killed steels with residual dissolved oxygen in the range 40 to 25 ppm are made by deoxidiz-
ing steel in the tap ladle with the addition of a small amount of aluminum together with silicoman-
ganese, or a combination of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese. In this case, the deoxidation product is
molten manganese aluminosilicate having a composition similar to 3MnO•Al2O3
•3SiO2. With a small
addition of aluminum, e.g. about 35 kg for a 220 to 240 ton heat together with Si/Mn, almost all the
aluminum is consumed in this combined deoxidation with Si and Mn. The residual dissolved alu-
minum in the steel will be less than 10 ppm. For the deoxidation product 3MnO•Al2O3
•3SiO2 satu-
rated with Al2O3, the silica activities are 0.27 at 1650°C, 0.17 at 1550°C and decreasing probably to
about 0.12 at 1500°C. Using these activity data the deoxidation equilibria are calculated for Al/Si/Mn;
these are compared in Fig. 2.128 with the residual ppm O for the Si/Mn deoxidation at the same con-
centrations of Mn and Si.

When intentionally using some Al for deoxidation or unintentionally with Al being in the ferrosili-
con the equilibrium deoxidation product can be solid Al2O3,molten manganese silicate or solid SiO2.
To avoid clogging of continuous casting nozzles it is desirable to have liquid inclusions. The equi-
librium deoxidation product is given as a function of Al and Si contents in Figure 2.129. As seen in
this figure even small amount of Al in solution will lead to Al2O3 inclusions which can clog nozzles. 
2.10.1.4 Deoxidation with Al
Numerous laboratory experiments have been made on the aluminum deoxidation of liquid iron
using the EMF technique for measuring the oxygen activity in the melt. The equilibrium constants
obtained from independent experimental studies, cited in Ref. 179 agree within about a factor of
two. An average value for the equilibrium constant is given below.
Al2O3(s) = 2[Al] + 3[O]
(2.10.7)
(2.10.8)
(2.10.9)
The alumina activity is with respect to pure solid Al2O3. The effect of aluminum on the activity
coefficient of oxygen dissolved in liquid steel is given by log fO = 3.9 ´ [%Al]. At low concentra-
tion of aluminum, fAl ~ 1.0.
It should be noted that in the commercial oxygen sensors the electrolyte tip is MgO-stabilized zir-
conia. At low oxygen potentials as with aluminum deoxidation, there is some electronic conduc-
tion in the MgO-stabilized zirconia which gives an EMF reading that is somewhat higher than Y2O3
or ThO2 stabilized zirconia where the electronic conduction is negligibly small. In other words, for
a given concentration of Al in the steel the commercial oxygen sensor, without correction for par-
tial electronic conduction, registers an oxygen activity that is higher than the true equilibrium

value. To be consistent with the commercial oxygen sensor readings, the following apparent equi-
librium constant may be used for reaction 2.10.7 for pure Al2O3 as the reaction product.
(2.10.10)
Another point to be clarified is that in the commercial oxygen sensor system, the EMF reading of
the oxygen activity is displayed on the instrument panel in terms of ppm O, as though the activity
coefficient fO = 1.0 in the Al-killed steel. If the deoxidized steel contains 0.05% Al, the apparent
oxygen activity using equation 2.10.10 will be (ppm O ´ fO) = 3.62; noting that at 0.05% Al, fO =
0.64, the apparent concentration of dissolved oxygen will be 3.62/0.64 = 5.65 ppm 0.
When the Al-killed steel is treated with Ca–Si the alumina inclusions are converted to molten cal-
cium aluminate. For the ratio %CaO/Al2O3 = 1:1, the activity of Al2O3 is 0.064 with respect to pure
Al2O3 at temperatures in the range 1500–1700°C. The apparent equilibrium relations, consistent
with the readings of commercial oxygen sensors, are shown in Fig. 2.130 for the deoxidation prod-
ucts: pure Al2O3 and molten calcium aluminate with %CaO/%Al2O3 = 1:1.
2.10.1.5 Silicon and Titanium Equilibrium in Aluminum Deoxidized Steel
When steels are deoxidized with aluminum and also contain silicon and titanium slag metal equi-
librium is established for these elements according to the reactions.
3SiO2 + 4Al = 2(Al2O3) + 3Si
(2.10.11)
3TiO2 + 4Al = 2(Al2O3) + 4Ti
(2.10.12)
In principle the equilibrium distribution ratio %Si/(%SiO2) and %Ti/(%TiO2) can be computed from
basic thermodynamics. The equilibrium ratios observed in practice are shown in Figure 2.131 and 2.132.

2.10.1.6 Rate Phenomena in Deoxidation
The equilibrium states for the common deoxidation reactions pertaining to steelmaking conditions
have been established reasonably well. However, the rate phenomena concerning the deoxidation
reactions is complex and is discussed in detail in a review paper by Turkdogan.182 A brief mention
of the state of our knowledge is adequate for the present purpose.
There are three basic consecutive steps involved in the deoxidation reaction; namely, formation of
critical nuclei of the deoxidation product in a homogeneous medium, progress of deoxidation
resulting in growth of the reaction products and their flotation from the melt.
Turkdogan has shown that because of the high interfacial tension between liquid iron and oxide and
silicate inclusions, a high supersaturation of the reactants in the metal is needed for spontaneous
nucleation of the deoxidation products as predicted from the theory of homogeneous nucleation. In
estimating the supersaturation ratio likely to be achieved under practical conditions, homogeneous
solution of deoxidizers in the steel was assumed. However, the dissolution of added deoxidizers in
liquid steel takes a finite time during which certain regions of the melt are expected to be very rich
in solute concentration:; in these regions the solution is sufficiently supersaturated locally for
homogeneous nucleation of the deoxidation product. Owing to the agitation in the ladle, the nuclei
thus formed are considered to be distributed in the melt, soon after the addition of deoxidizers.
Another source of nuclei is, of course, the thin oxide layer on the surface of particles of solid deox-
idizers added to steel.
A generally accepted view is that the deoxidation reactions at steelmaking temperatures are fast rela-
tive to other rate-controlling processes responsible for the growth and ultimate flotation of inclusions.
The rate phenomena is deoxidation is complex because of the side effects caused by the interplay
of several variables which cannot readily be accounted for in mathematical simulations of the deox-
idation process. However, certain important deductions can be made from the results of several
conceptual analyses based on simplified models and those of experimental observations.
1. The number of nuclei (z) formed at the time of addition of deoxidizers is of the
order of z =107/cm3 or higher.

2. The diffusion-controlled deoxidation reaction is essentially complete within a few
seconds when z > 106/cm3.
3. The deoxidation reaction may cease prematurely in parts of the melt depleted of
nuclei or oxide inclusions.
4. The inclusion size during deoxidation is in the range 1 to 40 mm.
5. In laboratory experiments with inductively stirred melts (~5 cm deep) most of the
oxide inclusions float out of the melt in 5 to 10 minutes.
6. The growth by collision and coalescence of ascending inclusions does not seem pos-
sible under the conditions of laboratory experiments with unstirred or moderately
stirred melts.
These observations are not mutually consistent. One possible explanation perhaps is that the nuclei
formed at the time of dissolution of deoxidizers are unevenly distributed in molten steel. In parts
of the melt where the number of nuclei is small, e.g. 104/cm3 to 105/cm3, the inclusions 20 to 40
mm in size rapidly float out of the melt, presumably prior to the deoxidation reaction. In parts of
the melt containing about 108 nuclei/cm3, the inclusions grow only to a micron size and ascend in
the melt with a creeping velocity. Convection currents or other means of stirring eventually bring
about more uniform distribution of these small inclusions. The particles thus brought to the parts
of the melt where the deoxidation reaction was incomplete, due to early depletion of inclusions,
bring about further deoxidation, growth and flotation.
Under practical conditions of deoxidation during filling of the ladle, there is sufficient stirring that
some inclusion growth may take place by collision and coalescence; also stirring brings about a
motion in the melt such that the inclusions could get attached to the surface of the ladle lining and
caught by the slag layer. Controlled gas stirring at low flow rates for 4–8 minutes is common prac-
tice to enhance inclusion removal.
2.10.2 Ladle Desulfurization 
It is possible to desulfurize aluminum killed steels in the ladle or ladle furnace, using CaO based
slags, to less than 20 ppm S. The chemical reaction can be written as 
3(CaO) + 2Al + 3S = 3(CaS) + Al2O3
(2.10.13)
The equilibrium sulfur distribution ratio can be calculated from the thermodynamics of reaction
2.10.13. In terms of the ionic reaction the reaction is 
2/3Al + S + (O2–-) = (S2–) + 1/3(Al2O3)
(2.10.14)
for which the equilibrium ratio is 
(2.10.15)
The value of KSA for CaO–Al2O3 and CaO–Al2O3–SiO2–MgO slags is shown in Figure 2.133.
The sulfur distribution ratios are shown in Fig. 2.134 and Fig. 2.135 for the stated Al contents.
From the data presented and a mass balance for sulfur it is possible to compute the final equi-
librium sulfur contents.
The slags will absorb sulfur until CaS forms decreasing the amount of dissolved CaO and decreas-
ing KSA. The solubility of CaS is given in Fig. 2.136.
Steels deoxidized with Si are difficult to desulfurize because the oxygen potential is significantly
higher than for Al killed steels. For these steels desulfurization is limited to 10 to 20%. Calcium
carbide is an effective desulfurizer because it decreases the oxygen potential and the resulting CaO
then is able to desulfurize.

Desulfurization is controlled by liquid phase mass
transfer. Since the sulfur distribution ratio is high
sulfur mass transfer in the metal is the primary rate
controlling process. For this case the rate of desul-
furization is given by the following178.

Desulfurization increases with stirring rate, which increases m and more importantly A by provid-
ing slag-metal mixing, increased values of Ls, and higher slag volumes. It has been shown that 90%
desulfurization can be achieved in 10–15 minutes of intense stirring.
2.10.3 Calcium Treatment of Steel
Calcium is usually employed in ladle metallurgy as Ca or CaSi cored wire or by injecting CaSi
powder. Calcium is highly reactive and it could deoxidize, desulfurize, modify oxide inclusions or
modify sulfide inclusions. It should only be used in deoxidized steels because it is too expensive
to be used as a deoxidizer. 
Since often the primary purpose of a calcium injection into the steel bath is to convert solid Al2O3
inclusions to liquid calcium aluminates to prevent Al2O3 from clogging casting nozzles, it is nec-
essary to know under what conditions it will react with the inclusions or simply react with sulfur.
There have been numerous thermodynamic calculations to predict the conditions for Al2O3 inclu-
sion modification. Several of these required knowledge of the thermodynamics of Ca in steel,
which is not accurately known. The conditions can be computed based on the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the inclusions themselves.
Consider the following reaction equilibrium in the calcium treated steel,
3(CaS) + (Al2O3) = 3(CaO) + 2Al + 3S
(2.10.20)
where CaS is that formed by the reaction of calcium and sulfur, (Al2O3) is an alumina rich inclu-
sion such as Al2O3,CaO•Al2O3, etc and (CaO) represents an inclusion richer in CaO. The results of
these calculations are given in Fig. 2.137 in which the inclusion stability is given as a function of
Al and S contents183. Below
the CA curve CaO•Al2O3 is the
stabler oxide and below the
C12A7 liquid curve, liquid cal-
cium aluminates form. For
example if Ca is added to a
steel containing 0.04% Al and
0.015% S the alumina inclu-
sion will be converted to solid
CaO•Al2O3 and calcium there
will react to form CaS. These
inclusions will clog casting
nozzles. For effective inclu-
sion modification the sulfur
content should be below
0.01% for a 0.04% Al steel.
Calcium also helps eliminate
MnS inclusions which form
during solidification. For a
steel low in sulfur which con-
tains liquid calcium aluminate
inclusions, much of the remain-
ing sulfur will be absorbed dur-
ing cooling and solidification
by these inclusions as they are
excellent desulfurizers. Also,
if any dissolved Ca is remain-
ing, although the authors
believe this will be very small,
it could react with sulfur on

the inclusions. The net result is a duplex inclusion consisting of a liquid calcium aluminate with a
CaS (MnS) rim. This is preferable to stringer MnS which can cause brittle fracture.
Effective calcium treatment is a critical issue and is discussed in Chapter 12 in more detail.
2.11 Fundamentals of Degassing
During the past two decades there has been an increase in vacuum degassing to reduce hydrogen
and nitrogen contents. However the major increase in vacuum degassing is for decarburization to
low carbon contents ( 40 ppm) which are required for good formability such as for interstitial free
(IF) steels. Vacuum degassing is discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Briefly there are two major types
of degassers: circulating, such as RH and RH–OB, and non-recirculating such as ladle and tank
degassers. In some cases oxygen is used to enhance the reactions, examples of these are RH–OB
(oxygen blowing) and VOD (vacuum oxygen decarburization).
Details on the types of degassers and the processes are given in Chapter 11. In this section only the
fundamental aspects of the reactions will be discussed. 
2.11.1 Fundamental Thermodynamics
In vacuum degassing hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen can be removed by the following reactions.
H = 1/2H2
(2.11.1)
N = 1/2N2
(2.11.2)
C + O (FeO, 1/2O2) = CO + (Fe)
(2.11.3)
Hydrogen and nitrogen are dissolved in
steel and removed by forming diatomic
molecules. The thermodynamics are given
in Section 2.4.
Carbon is removed by reaction with oxy-
gen as dissolved oxygen, FeO in slag or
gaseous oxygen (O2) to form CO. Due to
the reduced pressure the formation of CO
is favored. This is shown schematically in
Figure 2.138 as a plot of the equilibrium
carbon and oxygen contents at 1 and 0.2
atmosphere pressure. In RH and other
processes with oxygen the carbon reacts
with oxygen and follows the indicated
reaction path. Theoretically one atom of
oxygen requires one atom of dissolved
oxygen. However in actual processes
there are other sources of oxygen such as
leaks and unstable oxides in the slag (FeO
and MnO). In oxygen assisted processes
the reaction path is indicated as RH–OB
(or VOD). Initially gaseous oxygen
removes carbon, the oxygen blow is ter-
minated, and dissolved oxygen reacts
with carbon.

2.11.2 Vacuum Degassing Kinetics
In recirculating systems H2, N2 and CO are formed at two reaction sites: the rising argon bubbles
and the metal-vacuum interface above the melt. The model and plant data given by Bannenberg185
et al indicates that the Ar bubbles are the major reaction surface area for reactions at high Ar rates.
Recent work by Uljohn and Fruehan186 indicate at lower Ar flow rates both sites should be consid-
ered. As the argon bubbles burst at the surface they generate a large number of metal droplets and
surface area. In recirculating systems the reactions include the rising argon bubbles, the metal
droplets and homogenous or heterogeneous nucleated bubbles in the bath.
The hydrogen reaction is simply controlled by liquid phase mass transfer of hydrogen. Hydrogen
diffusivity is high and consequently the reaction is fast. For non recirculating systems the reactions
increase with argon stirring in a complex manner. Due to the expansion of the gas bubbles and the
dependence of bubble size on operating parameters, the rate equations are complex and the reader
is referred to Ref. 184 for details.
It should be noted that the reaction is limited not by H2 gas in the vessel but rather H2O. Even at
very low H2O pressures the equilibrium hydrogen content for reaction 2.11.4 is relatively high.
3H2O + 2Al = Al2O3 + 6H
(2.11.4)
For example, for pH2O = 2 ´ 10–6 atm and an aluminum content of 0.03%, the equilibrium hydro-
gen content is approximately 1 ppm.
The nitrogen reaction is controlled by mass transfer of nitrogen and chemical kinetics in series and
the mixed control model given in Section 2.2.4 can be applied. Again the reactions are complex
and the details are given elsewhere. However, the rate depends on the argon flow rate and sulfur
content; sulfur is surface active and retards the chemical reaction as discussed in Section 2.2.3.
Examples of calculated rates of nitrogen are given in Figs. 2.139 and 2.140. Nitrogen can only be
removed effectively at low sulfur contents and high Ar bubbling rates.

The rates in recirculating systems (RH) are complicated by the fact they also depend on the circu-
lation rate into the RH unit. For example the rate of decarburization in the ladle is given by
(2.11.5)
where 
Q
=
metal recirculation rate,
W
=
the weight of steel,
%CRH
=
the carbon content in the RH.
The change of carbon in the RH is given by
(2.11.6)
where k is the decarburization rate constant, %Ce is the equilibrium carbon content and WRH is the
weight of steel in the RH. An approximate solution to equation 2.11.6 is given by
(2.11.7)
where 
%Co
= 
the initial carbon content, 
K
= 
the overall reaction rate constant given by
(2.11.8)
Therefore the rate can be increased by increasing Q, WRH and k. For low circulation rates the rate
is controlled by the circulation rates. Consequently newer RH units have large snorkels and high
circulation rates. 
The hydrogen reaction in RH units are given by similar expressions. The major difference is that
kRH for hydrogen is larger because of faster mass transfer of hydrogen. Nitrogen removal in RH
units is generally slow and generally less than 5 ppm is removed.

3.1 Classification of Refractories
Refractories are the primary materials used by the steel industry in the internal linings of furnaces
for making iron and steel, in vessels for holding and transporting metal and slag, in furnaces for
heating steel before further processing, and in the flues or stacks through which hot gases are con-
ducted. At the risk of oversimplification, they may, therefore, be said to be materials of construc-
tion that are able to withstand temperatures from 260–1850°C (500–3400°F).
As seen in Fig. 3.l, the melting point of refractory materials in the pure state varies from
1815–3315°C (3300°–6000°F). Refractories in service can tolerate only small amounts of melting

(1–5%)  without loss of their important structural characteristics. Subsequent discussion will show,
however, that the use of many such materials is limited by factors such as cost or instability in cer-
tain atmospheres.  Also, fluxes present in the initial impure refractory and/or encountered in ser-
vice can seriously reduce these melting points.
Refractories are expensive, and any failure in the refractories results in a great loss of production
time, equipment, and sometimes the product itself. The type of refractories also will influence
energy consumption and product quality. Therefore, the problem of obtaining refractories best
suited to each application is of supreme importance. Economics greatly influence these problems,
and the refractory best suited for an application is not necessarily the one that lasts the longest, but
rather the one which provides the best balance between initial installed cost and service perfor-
mance. This balance is never fixed, but is constantly shifting as a result of the introduction of new
processes or new types of refractories. History reveals that refractory developments have occurred
largely as the result of the pressure for improvement caused by the persistent search for superior
metallurgical processes. The rapidity with which these ever recurring refractory problems have
been solved has been a large factor in the rate of advancement of the iron and steel industry. To dis-
cuss the many factors involved in these problems and to provide information helpful to their solu-
tion are the objectives of this chapter.
Refractories are also vital in the safe operation of the processes and must not expose personnel to haz-
ardous conditions during their manufacture, installation, use or during disposal following their use.
Refractories may be classified in a number of ways. From the chemical standpoint, refractory sub-
stances, in common with matter in general, are of three classes; namely, acid, basic, and neutral.
Theoretically, acid refractories should not be used in contact with basic slags, gases or fumes
whereas basic refractories can be best used in contact with a basic chemical environment. Actually,
for various reasons, these rules are often violated. Hence, the time honored chemical classification
is largely academic, and of little value as a guide to actual application. Also, the existence of a truly
neutral refractory may be doubted. Classifications by use, such as blast furnace refractories or
refractories for oxygen steelmaking, are generally too broad and are constantly subject to revision.
For our purposes, refractories will be classified with reference to the raw materials used in their
preparation and to the minerals predominating after processing for use. This classification is
believed to offer the best possibility for a clear understanding of the origin and nature of steel plant
refractories.
3.1.1 Magnesia or Magnesia–Lime Group
This group includes all refractories made from synthetic magnesites and dolomite. These consti-
tute the most important group of refractories for the basic steelmaking processes. All these mate-
rials are used primarily as a source of magnesia (MgO).
3.1.1.1 Magnesia
Modern high-purity magnesias are produced in well controlled processes. The principal sources of
magnesias are brines (often deep well type) and seawater. Magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, is pre-
cipitated from these sources by reaction with calcined dolomite or limestone; one source uses a novel
reactor process. The resultant magnesium hydroxide slurry is filtered to increase its solids content.
The filter cake can then be fed directly to a rotary kiln to produce refractory grade magnesia, but
more commonly now the filter cake is calcined at about 900–1000°C (1650 –1830°F), usually in mul-
tiple-hearth furnaces, to convert the magnesium hydroxide to active magnesia. This calcined magne-
sia is then briquetted or pelletized for firing into dense refractory-grade magnesia, usually in shaft
kilns which reach temperatures around 2000°C (3630°F). The end product is sintered magnesia.
Fused magnesia is produced by melting a refractory grade magnesia or other magnesia precursor
in an electric arc furnace. The molten mass is then removed from the furnace, cooled, and broken
up to begin its path for use in refractories.

The impurities in magnesia are controlled by the composition of the original source of the magne-
sia (brine or seawater), the composition of the calcined dolomite or limestone, and the processing
techniques. In particular the amounts and ratio of CaO and SiO2 are rigorously controlled, and the
B2O3 is held to very low levels. The end results are high-grade refractory magnesias which are
ready for processing into refractory products. Tables 3.1 through 3.4 show the compositions of dif-
ferent grades of magnesia.

High purity is quite important because MgO has high refractoriness and good resistance to basic
slags. Minimizing the total impurities content in magnesias is quite important because impurities
affect refractoriness and performance. A high CaO/SiO2 ratio, preferably 2:1 or slightly higher, is
optimum for maintaining high refractoriness in magnesias. As the total impurities are reduced to
about 1% or less, the CaO/SiO2 ratio has less and less significance. High density reduces infiltra-
tion and dissociation of magnesia grain by slag. Large crystallite size (best achieved in fused mag-
nesias) provides less surface area for slag attack. Low B2O3 content ensures high strength at elevated
temperatures for burned brick. Low lime to SiO2 ratios are required in certain products where MgO
is used with other raw materials (such as Cr2O3) or for maximum resistance to hydration.
3.1.1.2 Dolomite
The natural double carbonate dolomite (CaCO3
·MgCO3) can be converted to refractory dolomite
(CaO·MgO) by high temperature firing. A limited number of dolomite deposits exists in the world
with satisfactory uniformity, purity, and calcining behavior to be processed into high purity, refrac-
tory dolomite at a reasonable cost. High purity dolomite is greater than 97% CaO + MgO and

0.5–3% impurities. Most high purity dolomite deposits are difficult to calcine and sinter to high
density and usually require special methods to yield acceptable refractory grade dolomite. Silica,
iron oxide and alumina are the most common impurities in high purity dolomite. See Table 3.5.
Dolomite has excellent refractoriness and is thermodynamically very stable in contact with steel or
steelmaking slags. Note in Table 3.6 that CaO is the most stable of the common refractory oxides
at steelmaking temperatures.
The free lime portion of the dead burned
dolomite can react with atmospheric moisture
which causes the material to powder and
crumble. The degree of hydration under set
conditions of time, temperature, and relative
humidity is dependent upon the proportion of
lime and impurities contained in the material
and upon the density of the grain achieved
during the dead burning process.
In practice, with modern packaging materials
and techniques together with other means of
protecting the products, the storage of dolo-
mite products can be extended.
3.1.2 Magnesia–Chrome Group
Chrome ores, or chromites, often called chrome enriched spinels, are naturally occurring members
of the spinel mineral group. These materials are all characterized by relatively high melting points,
good temperature stability (particularly in thermal union with magnesite) and moderate thermal
expansion characteristics.
Chrome ores are covered by the formula (Mg•Fe+2) (Cr,Al,Fe+3)2O4¢ where magnesium can substi-
tute for iron, and aluminum for chromium. Accessory minerals, called gangue, are often associated
with these ores. Gangue minerals contribute residual silica, lime and additional magnesia to the
chrome ore. Control, placement and quantity of gangue minerals is as important to finished refrac-
tory properties as the basic chemical composition of the individual ore. Ores are often upgraded
by mechanical separation techniques to minimize impurities. Thus, chrome concentrates with low
gangue impurities, as shown in Table 3.7, are often the article of commerce used in refractories.
Pure Cr2O3 chemically separated from chromite can be used in combination with lower cost oxides
to produce specific refractory properties.
In addition to basic refractory raw materials composed of dead burned magnesia and chrome ore
as starting materials, other magnesite-chrome combinations are also a part of this series. A mag-
nesite-chrome group of raw materials exists, including co-sintered magnesite-chrome, fused mag-
nesite-chrome and synthetic picrochromite—a combination of magnesite and chromic oxide.
Typical magnesite-chrome combinations appear in Table 3.8.

3.1.3 Siliceous Group
3.1.3.1 Natural
Natural silica occurs primarily as the
mineral quartz. Heat treatment of sil-
ica in the manufacture of refractory
products can result in the formation
of a number of different crystalline
forms. Depending on the thermal his-
tory applied, silica refractories may
contain various mineral assemblages
of quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite.
Silica raw materials used in the man-
ufacture of conventional silica refrac-
tories, as shown in Table 3.9, must
contain high silica (99% or above
SiO2) and low impurity levels, partic-
ularly alumina and alkalies, which
can act as fluxes during firing of the
refractory and reduce overall refrac-
toriness of the end product.

3.1.3.2 Fused Silica
Fused silica is produced by actual fusion of specially selected, very high grade silica sands in elec-
tric arc, electrical resistance, or other furnace procedures. Crystalline raw material is converted into
an amorphous glass, or fused silica. Properties of this fused raw material vary considerably from
those of the original quartz sand, in particular fused silica has very low thermal expansion. Fused sil-
ica products exhibit low thermal conductivity, high purity and excellent resistance to thermal shock.
3.1.3.3 Silicon Carbide
Commercial silicon carbide (SiC) used as a refractory raw material is manufactured by abrasive
grain producers in electric furnaces from a mixture of coke and silica sand. The finished material
is extremely hard (9.1 MOH’s scale) with high thermal conductivity and good strength at elevated
temperatures, as well as very good resistance to thermal shock. Silicon carbide dissociates at
2185°C (3965°F) and oxidizes slowly in air, but is relatively stable under reducing conditions. The
material is serviceable at 1535–1650°C (2800–3000°F) for many applications. Table 3.10 shows
some analysis of refractory grade silicon carbides.
3.1.3.4 Zircon/Zirconia
Zircon, or zirconium silicate (ZrO2•SiO2), is a naturally occurring raw material having excellent
refractoriness. Specific gravity (4.5–4.6 g/cm3) is unusually high compared to most refractory
materials.
Major zircon sources include the natural sands of western Australia, eastern Florida, South Africa’s
northern Natal east coast, the European Economic Community countries and the Peoples Repub-
lic of China. Zircon usually is found with other heavy mineral sands, most notably titania miner-
als. Table 3.11 shows properties of zircon.
Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) is produced commercially as the naturally occurring mineral baddeleyite.
The refractory industry has been a major growth area for zirconia. The relatively high melting point
of baddeleyite, along with superior resistance to corrosion and erosion, make zirconia an ideal
component for several refractory systems. Zirconia in the natural state occurs in the monoclinic
crystal phase. When heated, zirconia undergoes a phase change (to tetragonal) and a volume
shrinkage of about 5%; with additional increases in temperature, the cubic form is stable at 2350°C
(4260°F). To counteract these deleterious phase changes, zirconia may be stabilized to the cubic
phase with small amounts of calcia, magnesia, or yttria, with the result that stability, thermal shock

enhanced in the final product. Zirconia
is available in the natural, stabilized, or
fused state, the latter often as a mixture
with alumina, silica, or other compati-
ble oxides. Table 3.12 shows typical
properties of zirconia.
3.1.4 Clay and High-Alumina
Group
3.1.4.1 Clays
Although clays were among the first
raw materials used to make refracto-
ries, their usage has diminished as
demands placed on modern refracto-
ries have necessitated better perform-
ing materials to replace them. Never-
theless, clays are still an important
material in the industry.
Clays may be used as binders, plasticizers, or as aggregates for producing refractories. The prop-
erties of some domestic clays are shown in Table 3.13.
3.1.4.2 Bauxitic Kaolins
Several other types of 50–70% alumina raw materials are also used in refractories. Bauxitic
kaolins, or bauxite clay combinations, represent another class of natural aluminum silicates used
in refractory manufacture. Major U.S. commercial deposits of aluminous refractory raw materials
are found in southeastern Alabama, and in east-central Georgia. These materials, shown in Table
3.14, are mined, blended and fired in rotary kilns to yield a versatile line of calcined aluminum sil-
icates, ranging from about 50% to over 70% alumina content.

3.1.4.3 Sillimanite
Andalusite, sillimanite and kyanite comprise the water-free, natural aluminum silicate varieties of
minerals known as the sillimanite group. Andalusite and kyanite are the more common commer-
cial materials. These minerals are normally about 60% alumina, with the balance composed pri-
marily of silica with minor iron and titania impurities, Table 3.15. Andalusite and sillimanite have
several important characteristics; when heated at high temperatures, the refractory mineral mullite
(3AL2O3•2SiO2) is formed. Complete mullite occurs at 1300–1400°C (2372–2552°F). This min-
eral is a key component of many high-alumina materials.
3.1.4.4 Bauxite
Bauxite in the crude state is a naturally occurring group of minerals composed primarily of either
gibbsite (Al2O3•3H2O), diaspore, or boehmite [AlO(OH)], and various types of accessory clays.
Refractory grade calcined bauxites are a specific form as found in Table 3.16. These are produced
from low iron, low silica materials in rotary kiln calcining operations or down-draft kilns. Calcin-
ing temperatures are in the 1400–1800°C (2550–3275°F) range. Crude bauxite is converted to the

Important features of bauxites are maximum alumina values (85% or more desired), maximum
bulk specific gravity, and minimum impurities such as iron oxide, titania, alkalies (Na2O,K2O and
Li2O) and alkaline earths (CaO and MgO). Major sources for calcined, refractory grade bauxite are
Guyana, South America, and the Peoples Republic of China.

3.1.5 Processed Alumina Group
Several types of chemically and thermally processed aluminas are used in refractories. These
include calcined, tabular, and fused alumina all from the Bayer process as illustrated in Fig. 3.2 and
Fig. 3.3.
In general, calcined aluminas are used to promote refractory binding during manufacture or use
whereas tabular or fused products form very stable aggregates. Tabular alumina is formed by cal-
cination at 1925°C (3500°F), whereas fused alumina is more dense after total melting and rapid
solidification. Tables 3.17 through 3.19 show properties of these alumina grades.

3.1.6 Carbon Group
Various carbon forms are used to an ever increasing extent in refractories. For example, modern
refractories use various graphite forms in combination with oxides to impart special properties.
The graphite may be synthetic in nature as produced by heating calcined petroleum coke to 3000°C
(5400°F) or may be natural graphite(s) from China, Mexico, Canada etc. Some all-carbon or all-
graphite refractories may be produced for applications in highly reducing atmospheres.

Generally, graphites are used in refractories in order to reduce the wetting characteristics of the
refractory material with respect to slag corrosion and to increase the thermal conductivity which
will result in better thermal shock resistance. In oxide-carbon refractories, the carbon content may
range anywhere from as low as 4–5% up to as high as 30–35%. Note that as the graphitic content
increases, the thermal conductivity of the refractory increases, but the density of the refractory
decreases. This result is primarily due to the fact that the density of graphite is much less than the
density of the other refractory materials being used. There are other contrasting differences in the
morphology of the graphite as compared to the other refractory materials. The graphite materials,
which are used in refractories, are commonly of a flaky structure; therefore, these flakes do not
lend themselves to the same particle packing phenomena as do granular particles.
Table 3.20 shows the properties of several types of graphite. Flake graphite is commonly purified to
extremely high carbon contents of 99 wt% carbon or higher. This purification utilizes both a chemi-
cal process and a thermal process; these steps have a significant effect on the price of the materials.
3.2 Preparation of Refractories
3.2.1 Refractory Forms
Refractories are produced in two basic forms: preshaped objects and unformed compositions in
granulated, plastic forms or spray mixes. The preformed products are called bricks and shapes. The
unformed products, depending on composition and application, are categorized as specialties or
monolithics. Refractory shapes, found in Fig. 3.4, may range from simple nine inch brick to
tapered 30 inch brick, or complex tubes or rods.
Specialties or monolithics are refractories that cure to form a monolithic, integral structure after
application. These include products known as plastics, ramming mixes, castables, pumpables,
pourables, spray mixes, gunning mixes and shotcreting. The mortars used to install brick and
shapes constitute a category of the specialty refractory classification.
Mortars are available in compositions that either approximate the brick they are bonding together,
or are chosen so that their thermal expansion will be similar to the brick with which they are used.
The goal is to achieve a lining that comes as close as possible to being a monolithic and continu-
ous refractory structure.
As the name implies, plastic refractories are ready-to-use materials that are installed by tamping or
ramming. After drying, either the heat from firing the equipment or a chemical binder converts the
plastic material to a solid, monolithic structure. Plastic refractories are available in both clay and
nonclay compositions.

Castables, or refractory concretes, are predominately dry, granular refractory mixes designed to be
mixed on site with water and capable of curing to a stable dimensional form through hydraulic or
chemical setting. Castables are particularly suited to the molding of special shapes and parts at the
installation site. They can be used for forming complete furnace linings, and other unique shapes.
They can be applied by pouring, pumping, troweling, gunning, and shotcreting. They have the
advantage of being readily usable at the operating temperature of the equipment after hydraulic or
chemical setting and removal of all moisture has taken place.
Spray mixes are made from a variety of refractory compositions. The common feature of these mate-
rials is that they contain sufficient water for transport via pumps and for spray application onto a fur-
nace wall or ceiling. A set accelerator is added in sufficient quantity such that the mix sets rapidly.
Gunning mixes comprise a variety of specialty refractory compositions that develop a solid shape
by air drying, hydraulic setting, or heat curing. The principal requirements are that they can be
blown into position by air pressure through a lance or nozzle, but must adhere on impact and build
up to the desired lining thickness. They are used for patch-type repairs, especially inside empty, hot
furnaces.
Fig. 3.5 is a greatly simplified flowsheet illustrating the various methods of refractory manufac-
ture and the resultant products, and classifies raw materials as either calcined, uncalcined (raw), or
binders. Calcined materials have been fired to remove moisture and volatiles and to densify the
material to minimize subsequent in-service shrinkage and reaction. The calcining temperature will
range from 1093–3315°C (2000–6000°F). Raw or uncalcined materials are cheaper to use than cal-
cined materials and are used to impart desirable characteristics such as plasticity or volume expan-
sion to certain refractories. Binders are used to impart strength to the refractory during
manufacture or in service.
3.2.2 Binder Types
3.2.2.1 Temporary Binder
Temporary binders include paper byproducts, sugar, or certain clays. Their function is to improve
handling strength during manufacture.

3.2.2.2 Chemical Binders
Chemical binders impart strength during manufac-
ture, after manufacture, or on installation as a
monolithic material. Tables 3.21 and 3.22 show
some of the binders which might be used for mono-
lithic materials depending on the application and
properties desired. 
3.2.2.3 Cement Binders
Cement binders set hydraulically when mixed with
water. The primary binders of this type used in
refractories are the calcium-aluminate cements
which set rapidly and are able to retain some of
their bonding strength to intermediate tempera-
tures. The cement(s) used in refractories are
CaO•Al2O3 type cements which develop strength
more rapidly than portland cements (near maxi-
mum strength in one day as opposed to 7–10 days)
and are capable of retaining strength to higher tem-
peratures than Portland cements. Table 3.23 shows
several grades of refractory cements.
3.2.2.4 Organic Binders
Organic binders include tars,
pitches, or resins for use in reduc-
ing atmospheres where the carbon
residuals impart bonding strength
or act to inhibit alteration.
The coal tar pitches, derived as
by-products of coke oven opera-
tion, were the preferred binders
for refractories up to the mid
1970s. Around 1978, transition
was made from coal tar to petro-
leum pitches. Today most organic
binders are resin based so they can
be processed cold to minimize
environmental problems.

Phenolic resins, the most important synthetic binders for refractory materials, are condensation
products of phenol and formaldehyde. These resins are differentiated according to whether they
represent novolacs or self curing resoles. The versatility of phenolic resins is derived from the var-
ious bonding functions that they can provide. Among other things phenolic resins can provide an
intermediate bonding function associated with a thermosetting range of properties during produc-
tion of refractory bricks and, at a later stage, are capable of forming (polymeric) carbon by
pyrolytic decomposition. In the form of bonding carbon, these results contribute to the quality of
the products.
3.2.3 Processing
A knowledge of the various steps in refractory processing is very important in understanding the
behavior of steelplant refractories. As shown in Figure 3.5, all refractories use crushing, sizing and
mixing or blending as the first steps in their manufacture. These steps produce the proper particle
sizings necessary for the desired product density and strength. In sizing a mix to produce dense
brick, for example, the raw materials are crushed and screened to produce some desired particle
size range as illustrated below:
The crushing and screening tech-
niques used are increasingly com-
plex, including vibratory screening
equipment and air classification
techniques.
Mixing and blending steps range
from the simple addition of water
to clay, to hot mixing of preheated
aggregates with selected resin or
other anhydrous binders. Special
sequences of combining raw mate-
rials, the time of mixing, and the
use of high energy mixing equipment are used to obtain uniform mixing and equal distribution of
additives.
Fig. 3.5 illustrates some (but not all) of the forming methods that are used after mixing and blend-
ing. The most widely used manufacturing method involves cold pressing of the grain-sized and
blended mix to produce a dense refractory shape. Power or dry pressing of the mix into a shape is
done on hydraulic or mechanical presses capable of forming the moist material (2–5% water) at
pressures of 34.5 to 103.4 MPa (5 to 15 ksi). The degree of compaction obtained in this pressure
range depends on plasticity and particle sizing, but most high quality brick are pressed to the point
where further pressure would produce laminations or internal cracking. The pressing chamber or
mold may be evacuated or de-aired to increase density and prevent laminations resulting from
entrapped air. Dry pressing lends itself to a wide variety of materials and can produce a wide range
of properties. Certain products may be pressed hot and these materials are usually plasticized with
liquid pitch.
Shapes may also be formed by applying pressure by other means such as vibration, pneumatic ram-
ming, hand molding, or isostatic pressing. Many brick and special shapes in fire clay compositions
are also formed by extrusion followed by low pressure pressing (the stiff mud repress process). In
this process, more plastic mixes (10–15% water) are forced through a die by a power driven auger,
cut into slugs, and then pressed to shape. This process usually involves de-airing during extrusion.
Hot extrusion of pitch or other anhydrous bonded materials may also be used; however, this is
mainly for monolithic materials.
In limited cases, raw materials are fused in very high temperature electric furnaces and cast into
larger ingots in graphite molds. These ingots can subsequently be cut to the desired shape, or may

be broken and crushed into a refractory raw material for use in conventional powder pressed brick
or for use in monoliths. In still another process, molten refractory may be blown, drawn, or spun
into fibers for subsequent use in forming mats, blankets, or boards.
Many refractory materials are used in bulk form. Sized, granular refractories may be used in dry
form or mixed with water at the plant site before installation by casting or gunning. Wet extruded
material may be packaged to avoid drying and shipped to the plant site ready for application by
ramming into place as a large monolithic structure. Wet bonding mortars may be shipped in sealed
containers ready for use.
As shown in Fig. 3.5 many products are prefired before shipment. The purpose of firing is to pro-
duce dimensionally stable products having specific properties. Firing in modern refractory plants
is accomplished in continuous or tunnel kilns.
In tunnel kiln firing, which is usually preceded by tunnel drying, the unfired brick loaded on small
cars are passed slowly through a long tunnel shaped refractory lined structure, divided successively
into preheating, firing and cooling zones, generally taking three to five days for the trip. This time
will vary widely, however, with the product being fired. Products of combustion from the fuel
burned in the firing zone pass into the preheating zone (countercurrent to the direction of travel of
the cars onto which the brick are stacked) and give up their heat to the oncoming loads of brick.
Some refractories are also fired in batch or periodic kilns where two to four week cycles are used
for heating, cooling, and loading and unloading kilns.
Temperatures of firing are important regardless of the type of kiln used, because both the quality and
properties of the brick may be affected. The final properties and behavior of most brick can be mod-
ified by firing them in an oxidizing or a reducing atmosphere. By controlling the rate of heating and
the maximum soaking temperature and soaking time, change in the  crystalline structure can be
effected, which in  turn can also affect the service performance of the brick. In general, the objectives
in firing are to (a) drive  off hygroscopic, combined water, and CO2; (b) bring about desired chemi-
cal changes such as oxidizing iron and sulfur compounds, and organic matter, etc; (c) effect trans-
formations of the mineral constituents and convert them to the most stable forms; and (d) effect
necessary combinations and vitrification of bonding agents. Firing temperatures vary from as low as
1093°C (2000°F) for certain fireclay materials to over 1770°C (3200°F) for some basic products.
Certain refractories with carbon binders or containing oxidizable constituents may be indirectly fired
inside muffles to prevent oxidation or may be packed in coke or graphite during firing for the same
purpose. One grade of carbon refractory is hot pressed by electrically heating it during pressing. This
accomplishes the forming and thermal treatment of the refractory in a single step. Nitrogen or other
special atmospheres may be used to impart special binding phases such as silicon nitride.
Manufacturing processes for making lightweight or insulating brick aim for high porosity, prefer-
ably with a fine pore structure. This is accomplished by mixing a bulky combustible substance, like
sawdust or ground cork, or volatile solid, such as napthalene, with the wet batch, by forcing air into
the wet plastic mass, or by mixing into the batch reagents which will react chemically to form a
gas and a product not injurious to the brick. In firing such brick, the combustible or volatile mate-
rial is eliminated and the remaining refractory structure is rigidized. Low density, pre-expanded
aggregate may also be used to make products by conventional brickmaking methods.
Some processing after the fired brick are produced may also be performed. For example the brick may
be steelcased for use in applications where oxidization of the steel case between brick serves to weld
or hold the brick together. Many brick types are also impregnated by placing the fired brick into vac-
uum tanks and introducing liquid pitch or resins into the brick pore structure. This treatment results
in formation of a carbon phase in service which has highly beneficial effects in some applications.
3.2.4 Products
With the large number of raw material types, refractory forms, and manufacturing techniques a
multitude of refractory products are produced. A significant number of them are currently used in
the iron and steel industry. This chapter and the one that follows will present considerable more
detail regarding the specific uses of refractories.

3.3 Chemical and Physical Characteristics of Refractories and
their Relation to Service Conditions
The foregoing discussions have indicated that there is a wide variety of refractories from the stand-
point of raw materials, overall composition, and method of manufacture. The requirements for
refractories are equally diverse. Analysis of service conditions in iron and steelmaking in general
shows that refractories are required to withstand: 
1. A wide range of temperature, up to 2200°C (4000°F).
2. Sudden changes in temperature; high tensile stresses accompanying these rapid
temperature changes cause thermal shock which result in cracking or fracturing.
3. Low levels of compressive stresses at both high and low temperatures.
4. Abrasive forces at both high and low temperatures.
5. The corrosive action of slags, ranging from acidic to basic in character.
6. The action of molten metals, always at high temperatures and capable of exerting
great pressures and buoyant forces.
7. The action of gasses, including CO, SO2, Cl, CH4, H2O, and volatile oxides and salts
of metals. All are capable of penetrating and reacting with the refractory.
8. As a refractory is being subjected to one or more of the previously stated conditions,
it usually functions as a highly effective insulator, or may also be required to be a
conductor or absorber of heat depending on its application. The refractory also must
perform without exposing workers or environments to unsafe or unhealthy condi-
tions at all times.
As any particular service environment usually involves more than one of the above factors, prede-
termining the life of a refractory is a complex process involving information on physical and ther-
mal properties as determined by laboratory testing, analysis of the effect of service or process
conditions and media on the refractory, and a knowledge of the fundamental reactions between
refractories and the various contaminants encountered in service. In this section the physical and
chemical characteristics of selected refractories as measured in a variety of laboratory tests will be
described as a general guide to understanding the complex nature of these materials in relation to
their service environments.
3.3.1 Chemical Composition
As described in the section on refractory classification, the raw materials used in making refracto-
ries differ appreciably and result in materials with a wide range of compositions. It must be empha-
sized that these are unaltered refractories before use and not refractories that have been chemically
changed in service. Refractories have the unique ability to withstand alteration by penetration,
contamination, and/or reaction in service and still function as reliable engineering materials. Sec-
tion 3.4 will describe the reactions between refractories and their environments. As a general rule,
however, recent trends in refractory development require refractories with the minimum content of
impurities, and these impurities are deliberately decreased during raw material or product process-
ing. The following describes the
undesirable constituents (originally
present or from contamination) in
several types of refractories. It
should be noted that many other
impurities (such as PbO, ZnO,
B2O3, etc.) which are undesirable in
all refractories because of their low
melting points have not been shown.

The importance of composition will be described in Section 3.4 where phase diagrams will be used
to indicate the reactions in refractories and their environment at elevated temperatures.
3.3.2 Density and Porosity
Refractory density and porosity are among the most misunderstood and yet useful characteristics
of steelplant refractories. It must be appreciated that most refractories are not fully dense but delib-
erately contain both open and closed pores. Fully dense refractory materials with their inherently
low tensile strengths can not resist the temperature gradients in normal service at constant tem-
peratures (for example across a wall of a furnace or a tube with steel inside and ambient conditions
outside). Refractory materials are also commonly made as heterogeneous structures to promote
resistance to thermal cracking. The volume of pores are measured by immersion of a refractory
specimen in a liquid or in vacuum. (The measurement of total volume is based on Archimedes’
principle that states that a body submerged in a fluid will weigh less than its actual weight by an
amount equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Knowing that difference in weight and the den-
sity of the fluid, the volume of the submerged body is easily calculated. The volume of open pores
is measured by the amount of liquid absorbed by the sample.)
Fig. 3.6 illustrates the difference between apparent and closed porosity and Fig. 3.7 shows the steps
in determining these properties using a vacuum pressure technique. These simple measurements
are somewhat useful in comparing like refractory products but most useful as quality control mea-
surements for the consistency of manufacture for a given refractory brand.

Schematic representation of: (a) open pore, and closed pore, and sample volume for (b) true poros-
ity, and (c) apparent porosity. From Ref. 2.
The size and quantity of pores in solid materials are found by measuring the quantity of mercury
that can be forced into the pores of the material under study at various pressures. Since mercury
does not usually wet the materials, the mercury will not penetrate the openings among the cluster
of particles unless force is applied. Thus, the mercury will penetrate into pores in strict relation-
ship with pressure.
Pore size not only defines the size  distribution of the pores of a refractory material, but also
defines the size of the bonds formed in the porous matrix and between the porous matrix and dense
coarse particles. The size of each bonding area has an important effect on the critical tradeoff in
refractories properties. A large number of smaller bond areas can blunt crack propagation and
increase crack propagation resistance, thereby improving thermal-shock resistance. However, a
smaller number of bonds with a larger cross-sectional area are slower to dissolve and can enhance
resistance to slag corrosion.
Fig. 3.8 shows typical pore size distribution results for several refractories. Note the small pore
sizes and differences between these products.

3.3.3  Refractoriness
The use of the classic PCE, pyrometric cone equivalent test, has little usefulness for today’s refrac-
tories. (This test measures a relative softening point.) The relative refractoriness of modern refrac-
tories is more meaningfully measured using tests for deformation under load and /or creep. Table
3.24 shows comparable results in a short time load test.
Like most structural materials, refractories
experience creep behavior, Fig. 3.9, when
exposed to high temperatures (0.5 ´ melting
temperature). Most refractories show two
characteristic stages of creep. In the first
stage, called primary creep, the rate of subsi-
dence declines gradually with time. In the
secondary stage, called steady state, the rate
of subsidence is constant. At very high tem-
peratures, steady state creep is sometimes fol-
lowed by tertiary creep region where the rate
of subsidence accelerates and leads to cata-
strophic failure or creep rupture. Primary
creep is generally short in duration, while sec-
ondary creep can occur over a long term.
Therefore, secondary creep usually provides a more meaningful comparison of refractories. Sec-
ondary creep is the parameter determined by the method described above.
Fig. 3.10 shows creep test results on several high alumina brick. Note that the low-alkali (low
impurity) 60% Al2O3 brick has superior creep resistance to high alumina brick with more alkali.
Such load and creep results are useful in many refractory applications. For example in a blast fur-
nace stove checker setting where loads and temperatures are known, Fig. 3.11, such information
can be readily used for design purposes.

3.3.4  Strength
The cold strength(s) of refractories are
commonly measured in either compres-
sion, Fig. 3.12 or transversely in a modu-
lus of rupture test, Fig. 3.13.
These cold strength values give some
measure of the consistency of the refrac-
tory product and its ability to function
during shipment and installation.
Hot strength values are also determined
by similar procedures with the refractory
specimen contained in a furnace which
may also provide for a protective atmos-
phere surrounding the specimen. Fig.

rupture apparatus.

Table 3.25 shows some typical cold properties for several types of refractories and the range of
properties between and within these groups are obvious. As previously stated, these cold proper-
ties are most useful in rating the consistency of quality of particular refractory products.
The hot strengths of refractories will vary significantly with temperature and with other parame-
ters such as furnace atmosphere. Fig. 3.15 and 3.16 illustrate the complex nature of refractory hot
strength for two types of refractories. Fig. 3.15 shows the strength of periclase-chrome refractories
as it varies with temperature and is affected by both composition and initial firing temperature dur-
ing manufacture. Fig. 3.16 shows the strength at a single test temperature as it is influenced by
small changes in the impurity (SiO2) level and the ratio of CaO to SiO2 in the refractory.

3.3.5 Stress-Strain Behavior
When a refractory is subjected to a mechanical load, it will compress. This behavior may be quan-
tified by the following equation:
e 5 }s
E
}
(3.3.1)
where:
e 5 strain (dimensionless),
s 5 stress psi (MPa),
E 5 Modulus of elasticity, psi (MPa).
Strain is equal to the amount of compression divided by the original length.

(3.3.3)
The modulus of elasticity, or Young’s Modulus, of a refractory is constant for a given material and
temperature.
The stress-strain behavior of a refractory material is determined by a method which is similar to that
used to measure hot crushing strength. A cylindrical sample is heated uniformly to the test temper-
ature and compressed using a mechanical testing machine. While loading the sample, the change in
its height is monitored by an electrical transducer which is connected by sapphire sensing rods with
the top and bottom of the sample. The data are used to create a stress versus strain curve.

Fig. 3.17 illustrates a typical stress-strain
curve. The initial portion of the curve is
usually linear and is called the elastic range.
The slope of the curve over this range gives
the modulus of elasticity. The point at
which the stress-strain curve becomes non-
linear is called the yield point. Straining the
material beyond this point results in perma-
nent deformation; this portion of the curve
is known as the plastic range. Further
straining of the material brings failure.
Some materials do not show plastic behav-
ior at certain temperatures, but instead fail
after elastic straining. Modulus of elasticity
values of a number of refractories are
shown in Table 3.26.
An understanding of the stress-strain behavior of refractories at elevated temperatures is important
in nearly all applications. The shell or superstructure of a vessel usually acts to restrain the thermal
expansion of the lining. Proper lining design may require gaps in the lining (thermal expansion
allowance) during installation to prevent catastrophic stress buildup in the lining during heating.
However, the expansion allowance must also be designed to prevent instability of the lining. The
engineer, too, must be concerned with the stresses which the expanding refractories induce in the
vessel shell or superstructure. Section 3.5 on the selection of refractories will further describe
analysis techniques for refractory behavior under stress.
3.3.6 Specific Heat
The specific heat of a refractory material indicates the amount of heat necessary to change its tem-
perature by a given amount. The specific heat is the amount of heat in British Thermal Units (BTU’s)
which must be absorbed by one pound of material to raise its temperature by one degree Fahrenheit.
Table 3.27 gives the specific heats of several types of refractory brick and refractory minerals.

The specific heat values for refractory materials are important in many applications because the
amount of heat stored in the lining during heating is often significant. In furnaces which are cycled,
large amounts of heat are alternately stored during heating stages and lost to the surroundings dur-
ing cooling stages. Applications for which high specific heat is desirable include blast furnace
stoves. Stoves are specifically designed to absorb and store heat from hot waste gases. The stored
heat is subsequently used to preheat combustion air.
3.3.7 Emissivity
Emissivity is the relative power of a surface to emit heat by radiation. It is expressed as a fraction
of the emissivity of an ideal black body. Such black body radiation is the maximum possible, but
it is never achieved by actual materials. A good radiator is an equally good absorber of heat. A
good reflector, obviously, is a poor absorber, and consequently a poor radiator. A perfect reflec-
tor, which also does not exist, would have an emissivity of zero. Materials do not radiate equally
well at all wavelengths. The ability to radiate at a particular wavelength is referred to as the mono-
chromatic  emissivity. Total emissivity refers to heat radiation over the entire spectrum of wave-
lengths. The total emissivity of most refractories decreases somewhat with an increase in
temperature.
Emissivities dictate the amount of heat which is radiated across a gap in a refractory structure. The
equation used to calculate this quantity is
Qr 5 s 1
2
(3.3.4)
where:
Qr 5 heat radiated across gap, Wm–2 (BTU hr–1 ft–2),
s 5 Stefan-Boltzmann constant, W/m–2 K–4(BTU hr–1 ft–2 °R–4),
T1 5 temperature of hotter surface of gap, K (°R),
T2 5 temperature of cooler surface of gap, K (°R),
e1 5 emissivity of hotter surface of gap, dimensionless,
e2 5 emissivity of cooler surface of gap, dimensionless.
In the above equation, the temperatures must be expressed using an absolute temperature scale. The
temperature in Kelvins is K = °C + 273; the temperature in degrees Rankin is °R = °F + 460. The
Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 5.670 ´ 10–9 Wm–2 K–4 (1.714 ´ 10–9 BTU hr–1 ft–2 R–4)
The emissivity of the outermost component of a vessel determines, to a large extent, the amount
of heat radiated to the surroundings. The loss to the environment by unobstructed radiation is
given by:
Qr 5 es (T1
4 2 T2
4)
(3.3.5)
where:
Qr 5 heat radiated to surroundings, Wm–2 (BTU hr–1 ft–2),
s 5 Stefan-Boltzmann constant, W/m–2 K–4(BTU hr–1 ft–2 °R–4),
e 5 emissivity of outer surface, dimensionless,
T1 5 temperature of outer surface, K (°R),
T2 5 temperature of surroundings, K (°R).
In most applications, the outer surface is a metallic shell such as carbon steel plate. the emissivity
of the shell, in this case, is affected by the degree of oxidation. The emissivity tends to increase as
the amount of oxidation increases.
Emissivity values for a number of refractories and materials commonly used for shells are listed in

3.3.8 Thermal Expansion
All refractories expand on heating in a manner related to their compositions. Fig. 3.18 shows clas-
sic examples of the expansion of divergent refractory types It is obvious that the shape of the
expansion curve with temperature and the maximum magnitude of the expansions differ apprecia-
bly. Compressible materials or voids are used for relieving such thermal expansion in any refrac-
tory construction because growth of several inches can obviously be experienced. Refractories with
linear or near linear thermal expansion generally require considerably less care than those with
non-linear expansion characteristics. A classic example of a refractory that requires care during
heatup is silica brick, which after firing consists of a carefully controlled balance of various min-
eral forms of the compound SiO. Fig. 3.19 shows the thermal expansion of the various silica min-
eral forms which make slow heatup through various critical ranges necessary. As a result of the
complex mineral makeup of silica brick, large constructions using these brick (such as coke ovens)
are heated and cooled at very slow rates and may require several weeks to reach operating tem-
peratures. Once the critical temperature ranges are passed, however, silica brick exhibit low and
uniform thermal expansion and may be thermally cycled without damage between 1000–1538°C
(1800–2800°F)

In general, the thermal expansion behaviors
of unfired refractories are more complex
than those of their fired counterparts. Dur-
ing initial heating, dramatic expansions or
contractions may occur in an unfired mate-
rial as a result of changes in bonding struc-
ture, changes in mineralogy, and sintering
effects.
The thermal expansion characteristics of a
number of cement-bonded refractories dur-
ing initial heat-up are shown in Fig. 3.20
These materials show shrinkage over the
temperature range 205–315°C (400–600°F)
which is associated with thermal decompo-
sition of the cement. The amount of shrink-
age is determined by the quality and
amount of cement. At temperatures above 980 to 1090°C (1800 to 2000°F), additional shrinkage
occurs as a result of sintering. The underlying thermal expansion is determined by the characteris-
tics of the aggregate. The shrinkages which take place during initial heat-up to 1430°C (2600°F)
are permanent in nature and commonly are on the order of 0.2 to 1.5%.

Thermal expansion curves for a number of magnesite-carbon brick are shown in Fig. 3.21. Through
the temperature range 370–540°C (700–1000°F), the formation of a glassy carbon bond tends to
densify the structure and shrinkage results. In materials which contain metals, expansive reactions
take place at higher temperatures. Brick which contain magnesium show a dramatic thermal expan-
sion over the range 540–705°C (1000–1300°F). Materials containing aluminum show gradual
acceleration of expansion above about 760°C (1400°F). Thermal expansion at high temperatures
increases significantly with increases in metals content. After heating to 1430°C (2600°F), mag-
nesite-carbon brick show permanent expansion of 0.1 to 1.0%.

3.3.9  Thermal Conductivity and Heat 
Transfer
As insulators, refractory materials have always
been used to conserve heat, and their resistance to
heat flow is a prime selection factor in many appli-
cations. Fig. 3.22 shows thermal conductivity
curves for several refractory types ranging from
dense refractories to insulating brick. Some refrac-
tories (for example, carbon or silicon carbide) have
appreciably higher conductivities (up to 43.26
Wm–1K–1 or 300 BTU hr–1ft–2°F in–1) whereas oth-
ers are available with conductivities lower than 0.14
Wm–1K–1 or 1 BTU hr–1ft–2°F in–1 (for example,
block insulation or refractory fiber forms).
Using measured conductivity values, heat transfer
losses through single or multiple component refrac-
tory walls can be calculated using the general for-
mula:

(3.3.6)
where:
Q/A 5 heat loss expressed as Wm2

Such calculations are now rapidly made using computer simulations where calculated heat trans-
fer rates can be balanced with loss from the outer refractory surface by radiation and  natural or
forced convection. Moreover, where once it was a slow mathematical process to determine even the
steady-state heat times, the advent of computers has made the rapid determination of the heat trans-
fer data for even transient conditions routine. Although it might seem that every construction
should be designed for minimum heat losses, this is not always the case, and care must be taken in
some situations including the following:
(1) The hot face refractories in a particular application must be able to withstand the
higher temperatures that will result when layers of highly insulating backup
materials are added.
(2) Other refractory properties must be suitable for the environment. For example,
most insulating materials will not stand direct exposure to metal or slag, and
backup materials may be subject to attack by vaporized process components
(alkali, sulfur compounds, acids) or their condensates. Gas channeling through
permeable materials must also be considered to prevent hot spots on shells.
(3) Insulation increases the depth of penetration and chemical attack on the hot-face
layer.
A wide variety of very insulating fiber based refractories are available in bulk, blanket, board, or
shaped forms. In such products, thermal conductivity is highly dependent on product density as
shown in Fig. 3.23.

Use of ultra-conductivity materials in a typ-

In certain applications, very high conductivity refractories are used to cool the refractory lining and
stabilize it against further refractory wear. Fig. 3.24 for example shows a blast furnace bosh using
graphite and semi-graphite materials with conductivities of 70–80 and 30–35 Wm–1K–1, respec-
tively, at 1000°C. (Note these values in comparison to the more conventional refractories shown in
Fig. 3.22). In such designs, heat extracted through the copper coolers enables the refractories to last
many times longer than uncooled linings. Similarly, a composite construction with silicon carbide
in a blast furnace stack as shown in Fig. 3.25 controls shell temperatures and allows the formation
of a stable lining. In this case the cooling plate density is desirable as varying from none to very
close or dense.

Many steelplant refractory applications also never reach thermal equilibrium, and dynamic heat
transfer calculations must be employed in the analysis of such applications. For example, a typical
steel ladle will cycle several times daily as shown in Fig. 3.26. During such cycles, the tempera-
ture at the hot face and to a lesser extent the entire lining, will show cyclic behavior, as displayed
in Fig. 3.27.
Importantly, remember that while heat flow at steady state is governed by thermal conductivity k
(first Fourier’s law), the material property required in the transient case is thermal diffusivity l
(second Fourier’s law).
Thermal diffusivity l is the equivalent of a diffusion coefficient in the Fourier equation for heat
flow and is a measure of how fast a heat pulse is transmitted through a solid. Thermal diffusivity
is related to both thermal conductivity and heat capacity through the relationship:
l 5 }r
k
Cp
}
(3.3.7)
where:
k 5 thermal conductivity,
r 5 density
Cp 5 heat capacity,
l 5 m2s–1.
Thermal diffusivity is most commonly determined by the heat-pulse method where a heat pulse is
applied to one side of a disc or short cylinder and the time period for the temperature of the oppo-
site face to reach one-half its final value is recorded. The heat pulse is commonly provided by a
power laser flash.
Table 3.29 shows some diffusivity values for selected products. The relationship among density,
heat capacity, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity should be borne in mind, so if one prop-
erty is unkown, the others can be reqadily calculated.

3.3.10 Thermal Shock
Thermal shock resistance is a complex issue when investigating refractory system design. Thermal
shock or spalling is caused by thermal stresses which develop from uneven rates of expansion and
contraction within the refractory, caused by rapid temperature changes or high inherent tempera-
ture gradients in a refractory. A qualitative prediction of the resistance of materials to fracture by
thermal shock can be expressed by the factor:
}a
k
E
s
}
(3.3.8)
where:
k 5 thermal conductivity,
s 5 tensile strength,
a 5 coefficient of thermal expansion,
E 5 modulus of elasticity.
The higher the value of the factor in Eq. 3.3.8, the higher the predicted thermal shock resistance of
the material. Some measure of shock resistance can be obtained using the work of fracture measure-
ments at elevated temperatures to predict the energy to propagate a slow moving crack. Other ther-
mal shock measurement techniques usually involve thermal cycle tests as described in Section 3.5.
3.4 Reactions at Elevated Temperatures
The foregoing discussion of the high temperature behavior of refractories emphasizes physical fac-
tors, but refractory behavior also depends greatly on high temperature reactions occurring not only
within the the refractories themselves but between refractories and contaminants encountered in
service.
Phase equilibrium diagrams have proved to be invaluable guides to understanding service reactions
and the influence of composition on refractory properties. As excellent compilations of diagrams
have been published (see references at end of chapter), only a few are reproduced here. However,
it should be recognized that these diagrams are not without limitations in their use to predict or
explain refractory behavior. For example, the various systems have been explored using simple
combinations of pure oxides and represent equilibrium conditions, while refractories are rarely
pure and seldom in equilibrium, either as manufactured or in service. Because of this complex
chemical nature of refractories, information is often needed on reactions involving so many oxides
that the usefulness of phase equilibrium information on systems involving three or four oxides is
minimal. The diagrams also give no information on such significant matters as viscosity of the liq-
uids formed or the rates at which reactions proceed.

Fig. 3.28 shows the Al2O3–
SiO2 system which applies to
silica, fireclay, and high alu-
mina refractories. It will be
noted that the lowest temper-
ature at which any liquid is
developed in the system is
1590°C (2894°F), while those
compositions more alumi-
nous than mullite (3Al2O3•
2SiO2) or above 71.8% Al2O3
develop liquids at quite high
temperatures. It is obvious
that useful refractories can be
made of the pure oxides Al2O3
or SiO2. The pronounced effect
of the impurities present in
most commercial refractories
in this system can be appreci-
ated by comparing the tem-
peratures at which they de-
form initially under load,
1150–1200°C (2100–2200°F),
with the initial liquid temper-
atures of 1540 or 1840°C
(2874 or 3344°F) indicated
on the diagram. The oxide
impurities largely responsi-
ble for lowering the refrac-
toriness of fireclay refracto-
ries are CaO, MgO, FeO,
Na2O, and K2O. As previ-
ously described, mining and
beneficiation techniques are
now widely used to obtain
raw materials with minimum
impurity levels.

Fig. 3.29 shows the FeO–Al2O3–SiO2 system. Here it is seen that the formation of some liquid can
be expected even below about 1095°C (2000°F) with Al2O3–SiO2 refractories and that very dam-
aging amounts will be formed at the higher temperatures common to iron and steel processes. This
is particularly true as iron oxide bearing liquids are characteristically very fluid.
Fig. 3.30 is the diagram of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 system, which is most applicable to reactions of
fireclay refractories with blast furnace slags and indicates superior resistance for higher Al2O3
products in such environments. This system has also been useful in predicting behavior of silica
brick, which will be discussed later.
The ternary phase equilibrium diagrams for K2O or Na2O reactions with Al2O3 and SiO2 are repro-
duced in Fig. 3.31 and Fig. 3.32. It is evident that the refractoriness of alumina-silica refractories
will be seriously affected by very small amounts of Na2O, less than 1% being sufficient to lower
the temperature of initial liquid formation to less than about 1095°C (2000°F), while approxi-
mately 10% is sufficient to completely liquefy the more siliceous alumina-silica compositions at
about 1205°C (2200°F). Potassium oxide (K2O) has a similar effect in amounts up to 10%.

Low levels of impurities are far more critical in silica brick than fireclay brick, and alkalies are the
worst offenders. The amounts of Na2O, K2O, and Al2O3 required to lower the melting point of pure
silica from about 1725°C to about 1675°C (about 3140°F to about 3050°F) are, respectively 1.4,
1.9, and 3.1%.
Another very deleterious fluxing agent for fireclay refractories is MnO, as can ben seen in the dia-
gram of the MnO–Al2O3–SiO2 system in Fig. 3.33. Note that this system is quite similar to the
FeO–Al2O3–SiO2 system.
Because the raw materials for silica brick lack both a natural bond and a high melting point, care
must be taken that the required bonding addition has the minimum effect on refractoriness. Fig.
3.34 shows the CaO–SiO2 system and explains why lime is universally used for this purpose. With
additions of CaO to SiO2, the melting temperature remains unchanged between 1 and 27.5% CaO,
due to the formation of two immiscible liquids. No such phenomenon occurs in the Al2O3–SiO2
system, and by referring again to the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 system, it is found that only a small amount
of Al2O3 is required to destroy the CaO–SiO2 immiscibility. In fact the effect of minor increments

of Al2O3 on the liquid development of silica brick is such that the temperature of failure under a
load of 172 kPa (25 psi) will decrease approximately 5°C (10°F) for each 0.1% increase in Al2O3
in the 0.3 to 1.2% range of Al2O3 between super duty and conventional silica brick. Fig. 3.35 of
the FeO–SiO2 system shows that FeO, like CaO, also forms two immiscible liquids when added to
SiO2, thus greatly increasing the tolerance of silica brick for FeO. Furthermore, as with CaO, a
small amount of Al2O3 can eliminate this immiscibility.
As atmospheric conditions in steelplant furnaces may range from highly reducing to highly oxi-
dizing, the form of iron oxides present may vary from FeO to Fe2O3. Accordingly, Fig. 3.36 shows
the system FeO–Fe2O3–SiO2  and is of considerable importance in understanding the behavior of
silica brick in service. Thus, it is seen that the lowest-melting liquids occur from reaction of FeO
and SiO2, and that at temperatures in the range of 1455–1665°C (2650–3030°F) less liquid, and a
less siliceous liquid, will be produced with either FeO•Fe2O3, or Fe2O3 than with FeO, due to the
greater extent of the two liquid region under oxidizing conditions.
The two principal refractory oxides considered to be basic are magnesia (MgO) and calcia (CaO).
Magnesia is noted for its tolerance to iron oxides. As shown in Fig. 3.37, MgO and FeO form a

continuous series of solid solutions which have high refractoriness even with very high FeO con-
tents. Under oxidizing conditions, magnesia is even more tolerant to iron oxide. Magnesia and iron
oxide form the refractory compound magnesioferrite (MgO·Fe2O3) which contains 80 wt% Fe2O3.
Magnesioferrite forms solid solutions with magnetite (FeO·Fe2O3) at higher iron oxide contents
and with magnesia at lower iron oxide contents. On the other hand, calcia is more reactive with iron
oxide, forming low melting calcium ferrites such as dicalcium ferrite (2CaO·Fe2O3) that melts
incongruently at ~1440°C (~2620°F). Also, calcia is subject to hydration and disruptive disinte-
gration on exposure to atmospheric conditions and cannot be used in refractory shapes made by
conventional procedures. It is evident, therefore, that magnesia is the more useful basic refractory
oxide and forms the base for all types of basic refractories including those made from magnesite,
olivine, dead burned dolomite, and magnesite and chrome ore.
Magnesia-bearing refractories, regardless of type, contain accessory refractory oxides and
encounter other refractory oxides in service which exert an important influence on their perfor-
mance. Fig. 3.38 shows the reactions and phase assemblages in the MgO–CaO–SiO2 system. In the
high MgO portion of this system, the principal mineral is of course always periclase. The accessory

considerably depending on the ratio of CaO to

by the CaO/SiO2 weight ratio and their

the intended application.The fosterite bond,
which occurs at CaO/SiO2 ratios less than

excessive formation of monticellite and mer-

be obtained at CaO/SiO2 ratios above 1.86 where refractory dicalcium or tricalcium silicates are
present. In recent years, in addition to the control of CaO/SiO2 ratio, increased emphasis has been
placed on decreasing the amounts of lime and silica present to obtain the maximum advantage of
the properties of nearly pure magnesia. This has been accomplished largely through the use of the
improved synthetic magnesites.
The high temperature reactions of refractories made from magnesia and chrome ore are under con-
stant study. The properties of refractories made from these two raw materials are excellent because
of the tendency of each to minimize the major weaknesses of the other constituent. Chrome ore
consists of a solid solution of chrome spinels (Mg,Fe)O·(Cr,Al,Fe)O3 with appreciable amounts of
gangue silicates. At high temperatures, the gangue silicate in chrome ores is responsible for poor
resistance to deformation under load and the iron oxides, when alternately oxidized and reduced,
cause expansion and contraction, often causing disintegration. Also, chrome spinel shows consid-
erable growth or bursting when reacted with iron oxide at high temperatures as a result of the for-
mation of solid solutions of magnetite (FeO·Fe2O3) and other spinels. With additions of magnesia

203
to chrome ore, however, the gangue silicates are converted on firing during manufacture or in ser-
vice to the more refractory phases such as forsterite or dicalcium silicate, and the iron oxide to the
spinel MgO·Fe2O3 by co-diffusion of Fe2O3 and MgO between the magnesia and chrome spinel.
MgO·Fe2O3 is more resistant to deterioration in cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions than the
iron oxides in the original chrome ore. The addition of still greater amounts of magnesia to chrome
ore improves significantly the resistance of the refractory to iron oxide bursting because of the
greater affinity of magnesia for iron oxide as compared with Cr2O3. The addition of chrome ore to
magnesia on the other hand improves the resistance of magnesia to thermal spalling through an
apparent stress relief in an otherwise rigid structure.
As in magnesia refractories, the CaO/SiO2 ratio exerts an important influence on the phases pre-
sent in composite refractories of magnesia and chrome ore. At CaO/SiO2 ratios less than 1.86, the
primary phases between MgO, CaO, and SiO2 are the same as that previously discussed with the
sesquioxides Cr2O3, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 combined with MgO and FeO to form spinel solid solutions.
At higher CaO/SiO2 ratios, the sesquioxides form low melting compounds with CaO.
As in magnesia refractories, efforts have been made to replace the silicate bond in refractories
made from magnesia and chrome ore. The most noteworthy of these efforts to date is the use of fir-
ing temperatures above those normally employed to produce a low silica burned basic refractory
with so-called direct bonding of the magnesia. Fig. 3.39 shows photomicrographs of the conven-
tional silicate and these direct bonds, respectively. Direct-bonded brick have usually high hot
strengths, several times that of conventional brick of similar composition.
Although the phase assemblages previously discussed indicate the general combinations of iron
oxides in basic refractories, it is equally important to consider the influence of furnace temperature
and atmosphere on the oxidation state of the iron present in various compositions including the
oxides MgO, Cr2O3, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe2O3. It has been shown, for example, that in mixtures con-
sisting originally of Fe2O3 and MgO·Fe2O3, dissociation of the Fe2O3 is accompanied by solution
of the dissociation product magnetite (FeO·Fe2O3) in MgO·Fe2O3 until a single spinel phase is

formed. In this same region, it has been shown that the spinel to sesquioxide transition tempera-
ture decreases as the magnesia content increases, but at the same time magnesia stabilizes Fe2O3
at higher temperatures. Chrome oxide (Cr2O3), on the other hand, has an opposite effect to mag-
nesia in that it increases the sesquioxide to spinel transition temperature and lowers the degree of
dissociation of Fe2O3 at higher temperatures. In mixtures consisting initially of MgO·Fe2O3 and
MgO, dissociation of Fe2O3 proceeds with a decrease in the amount of spinel and solution of iron
oxide in periclase.
With the advent of carbon bonded refractories and oxide carbon refractories, the study of oxide
reducing, gas-solid reactions has become an important concern for refractory technologists. Three
main subjects are important: the straight or the direct oxidation of carbon (and graphite) by air; the
reduction of magnesia (and other oxides) by carbon (graphite); and the role of antioxidants.
The rate of the magnesia-carbon reaction below is mainly affected, in addition to temperature, by
the purity and the crystal size of the magnesia grain.
MgO(s) 1 C(s) ®Mg(g) 1 CO(g)
(3.4.1)
This reaction reduces the magnesia to Mg vapor, which migrates to the surface, oxidizes, and forms
a dense MgO zone or is incorporated in the furnace atmosphere. The dense zone may have a pos-
itive effect on the resistance to slag attack and oxidation resistance, but, on the other hand, the loss
of refractory ingredients due to the MgO–C reaction results in a porous matrix behind the hot face
which can be easily penetrated by slag at a later stage.
Antioxidants as metals (Mg, Al, Si) or carbides (SiC, B3C) are often used to improve refractory
properties such as oxidation resistance. Metals are added as antioxidants due to the fact that the

affinity of some metals to oxygen, at the
critical temperature range, is stronger
than that of carbon. Each metal, or metal
combination, has a different oxidation
resistance characteristic as shown in Fig.
3.40. By protecting the graphite and the
bond network from oxidation, and
through the formation of carbides and
nitrites, the metals improve the elevated
temperature strength, in air, and under
reducing atmospheres; see Fig. 3.41.
Moreover, once the graphite is oxidized,
there is no barrier preventing the magne-
sia grain from being washed into the
slag; therefore, by protecting the graph-
ite from oxidation, the metals also im-
prove the resistance to slag attack.

Results of thermodynamic calculations of magnesia carbon refractories are summarized in Table
3.31. In this table Zone I is at the refractory hot face and Zone V is at the cold face. The oxides are
to be found in a decarburized zone at the hot face. In the next zone, metal oxidation should be
occurring together with the formation of secondary carbon from CO present inside of the brick
matrix. This secondary carbon could produce extremely low porosity and a low permeable zone
that precludes gas penetration and slag infiltration into the brick matrix. When CO is completely
used up and only N2 is available, the latter gas will form AlN and Mg3N2, respectively.
Carbides of Al, Si, and perhaps Mg can be formed by direct reaction between the respective metal
and carbon further from the hot face. Thermodynamically, the effectiveness of the metals as antiox-
idants should be in the order Si–Al–Mg, least to most. Experimental data showed, however, that the
order is reversed and does not follow oxygen affinity to the metals.

3.5 Testing and Selection of Refractories
3.5.1 Simulated Service Tests
Section 3.3 described various tests for single refractory properties. Because most refractories wear
by a complex combination of mechanisms, many simulated tests have been developed to study
refractory behavior for specific applications.
One simple example includes failure of refractories in a special gaseous environment such as car-
bon monoxide. Carbon monoxide disintegration occurs as carbon from the CO gas deposits around
iron concentrations in a refractory:
2CO®CO2 1 C
(3.5.1)
The iron concentrations catalyze this reaction, producing carbon buildups and growth on iron loca-
tions which may fracture the refractory behind the hot face (the above reaction is highly tempera-
ture sensitive). Simulative tests have been designed to predict resistance to carbon monoxide
disintegration in all types of refractories by heating the refractory for long periods in CO gas. Fig.
3.42 shows refractory samples after such tests. Although refractories without iron will not be
affected by this reaction, the total removal of iron from most natural raw material is not economi-
cally practical. A more practical solution involves proper handling of raw materials and processes
to remove ternary iron and minimize iron contamination from grinding. Control of the form of iron
in the fired aggregate in monolithic materials or fired products has led to the development of spe-
cial low iron refractories for blast furnace linings. Grinding equipment improvements and magnetic

separation have further been used to minimize contamination. Examples of other simple simulated
service tests include testing for exposure to alkalis, hydration, sulfidation, or oxidation.
Many more complex simulative tests exist where various failure mechanisms may be simulated at
one time. For example, refractory samples may be exposed to slags in a rotating furnace heated
with an oxygen-gas torch as shown in Fig. 3.43 (a), (b), and (c). In this test refractory wear from
chemical reaction with the molten slag, erosion by slag, thermal cycling, and other effects can be
measured for various times, temperatures, and atmospheres.
Similiar slag tests are conducted using a metal induction furnace with the specimen as part of the
lining. In this case, wear by both metal and slag can be obtained on the same refractory specimens,
as illustrated in Fig. 3.44.
The results from such tests can usually be correlated with the overall composition, with specific
additives to the refractory and with the overall physical characteristics of the refractory. These
effects are illustrated in Fig. 3.45 through Fig. 3.47. The slag resistance of various basic brick are

shown to be related to brick compo-
sition (MgO content) and physical
structure (apparent porosity) and the
slag resistance of a magnesia carbon
brick is related to the type of metal
antioxidant used.
Refractory specimens may also be
exposed to erosion and thermal
shock by dipping or spinning in
steel baths or by pouring steel on or
through them. For example, Fig.
3.48 shows steel pouring tubes after
testing in steel while they were
rotated at various speeds to simulate
steel flowing through the exit ports.
It should always be remembered
that any of the simulated refractory
tests fail to some degree to duplicate
service conditions. Fig. 3.49 is an effort to fully characterize the slag-refractory reaction involving
wear by corrosion, penetration and dissolution.
What makes corrosion resistance so difficult to measure is the fact that this characteristic is also a
matter of the composition of the slags and their fluidity or viscosity, surface tension, wettability
and work of adhesion, thermal conductivity, mass conductivity and density.
The extrinsic properties of both the refractory and the slag are also important parameters to define
shape and size of the bricks, lining design, nature of the joints, expansion joints, and method of
refractory installation, on one hand; fluid dynamics, heat and mass transport phenomena at the

refractory-slag interface, temperature, pressure, temperature gradients, concentration gradients,
variability, and the cyclic nature of the process, on the other hand.
In porous refractories, corrosion-dissolution is an accompaniment of penetration (chemical inva-
sion) into pores, but also in all openings: at the lining level, in open joints, gaps, and cracks; at the
brick level, in connected networks of voids so the texture of refractories and the method of instal-
lation are of paramount importance.
Both physical penetration and chemical invasion are favored by effective slag-solid wetting and by
low viscosity of the slag. Therefore, the slag chemical composition is also of paramount importance.
Slag corrosion always begins with the dissolution of either the matrix material and/or the aggregates
themselves, or, in other words, by the interaction of some minor or major constituents of the refrac-
tories with the liquid slag. Dissolution means either the solubility of a solid phase into a liquid
phase, or a chemical reaction leading to the disappearance of the original solid phase. Therefore,
knowing whether the product is liquid or solid at the prevailing temperature is very important.
3.5.2 Post-Mortem Studies
To improve refractory life, the mechanisms by
which the refractories are consumed must be
fully understood. A considerable and continu-
ing effort has therefore been made to thor-
oughly analyze used refractories and to
integrate this information into improved
refractory products. In its simplest form, used
refractories are examined by chemical analy-
ses and by microscopic methods. Fig. 3.50
shows results using this approach on two types
of brick taken from a BOF furnace after ser-
vice. In the magnesite brick without pitch
(burned product), CaO, FeO, and SiO2 from
the slag have penetrated the brick to a depth of
25 to 75 mm (l to 3 in.) and altered the
microstructure and properties of the refrac-
tory. Such a refractory may not wear uni-
formly due to structural spalling as well as hot
face corrosion and erosion. In a similar mag-
nesite brick made with pitch or having
retained carbon, penetration has been
restricted to an area only a few millimetres
thick by the presence of carbon in the brick.
The carbon minimizes wetting and causes the
formation of a dense impervious layer due to
limited MgO volatilization. A carbon bearing
refractory of this type wears uniformly by cor-
rosion and erosion. The brick without carbon
has been severely altered by slag penetration.
diffusion, and reaction with the brick compo-
nents, whereas penetration has been held to 1
to 2 mm in the carbon bearing brick. Unfortu-
rately, carbon penetration inhibitors cannot be
used for all applications because the carbon is
easily oxidized in some oxidizing processes.

Many more sophisticated techniques can be used as part of post-mortem examinations including
x-ray, scanning electron microscope, or electron probe techniques. Fig. 3.51 illustrated the use of
the electron probe to indicate the distribution of impurities in a zirconia refractory. The concentra-
tion of impurities in the grain boundary area is typical of refractory material and helps to explain
why small quantities of such impurities often produce significant detrimental effects including a
significant loss in refractoriness.
3.5.3 Thermomechanical Behavior
Studies of the thermomechanical behavior of refractories and refractory lining systems are being
used to an increased extent. The availability of larger personal and professional computers and
sophisticated software has resulted in increased use of such techniques in refractory design and
failure analysis. Compressive static stress/strain data along with compressive creep data, both at
realistic stress levels, are required to characterize the mechanical behavior of refractories. Refractory

lining systems are subjected primarily to strain
controlled loadings (restrained thermal expansion)
and to a much lesser degree stress controlled load-
ings. As a result, ultimate compressive strain is a
better parameter for ranking and selecting the
strongest refractory and not the ultimate compres-
sive stress. Methods for measuring strain and creep
were briefly described in Section 3.3.5.
The refractory criteria selected for use in these
analysis techniques are becoming increasingly
realistic. Fig. 3.52 shows calculated results using
older elastic modulus data on refractories which
gave unrealistically high shell stress values in a
steel ladle. These values could be reduced to more
realistic (measured) values by adjusting the mod-
ulus of elasticity values.
The latest analysis techniques require static com-
pressive stress-strain data and compressive creep
data at reasonably high stress levels. Fig. 3.53 shows
stress-strain behavior of a high alumina refractory
with and without mortar joints, which serve to
reduce the stress level for any degree of strain.
Stress analysis can be used to understand and
modify observed refractory behavior.

Fig. 3.54 shows the radial compressive load of the working lining against the safety lining that
results from the thermal expansion of the ladle refractory brick in an oval shaped ladle. Note that
the force imposed by the working lining on the safety lining is greatest in the radial section of the
ladle. This compressive force diminishes in the flatter section of the trunnion. Cooling of the
refractory between heats causes an inverted thermal gradient through the ladle lining with the brick
hot face at a lower temperature than the intermediate temperatures deeper in the lining, as illus-
trated in Fig. 3.55.

These mechanisms help explain the problems experienced by oval type ladles in the ladle straight
sections. Varying material expansion under load characteristics can reduce such problems.
3.6 General Uses of Refractories
Other chapters of this book cover the uses of refractories in specific applications. This section is
intended to offer only a flavor of refractory uses along with general comments.
3.6.1 Linings
The most common type of installation involves a refractory lining to contain molten metal and slag.
Such linings are made of several types of refractories to resist specific conditions and usually con-
sist of a working or hot face lining and a backup lining of material which may include an insulating
material to reduce shell temperatures. Fig. 3.56 shows a typical lining in a steel ladle used in mod-
ern steelmaking to transport and treat molten steel and slag. Note the use of high alumina castable
(85–95% Al2O3) in the metal portion of the ladle with basic (MgO–chrome or MgO–carbon) brick
in the area which must resist slag. The conditions to which refractories in ladles are subjected are
very severe as the ladle will undergo several process cycles daily and may be used for complex

ladle refining, arc reheating, degassing, or other treatments. Fig. 3.57 shows the different cycles to
which ladles are exposed in one steelmaking shop which produces various slab and bloom heats.
Life of the working lining will range from as little as 20 heats for some slag lines to over 100 heats
for the barrel or metal containing zone. Increased ladle wear will result from factors such as:
• higher tap temperatures,
• localized tap stream erosion,
• increased overall steel holding time,
• corrosion by superheated artificial slags during arc heating,
• thermomechanical cracking associated with ladle movements,
• more thermal cycling.

Table 3.32 shows various changes
which might be made in MgO–car-
bon brick to improve their life at the
slag line. The exact brick selected
will be based on the most economic
materials in balance with the life of
the remaining components of the
ladle.
Slag line life will depend strongly
on the extent of arc reheating and
the manner in which it is con-
ducted. Fig. 3.58 shows the extent
to which slag is superheated de-
pending on the thickness of the slag
layer and the manner in which it is
stirred with lances, porous plugs, or by electro-
magnetic force. Increased superheat can increase
refractory erosion 2–4 times the normal rates.
3.6.2 Metal Containment, Control and
Protection
Fig. 3.59 shows a simple concept of the various
refractories used in the modern casting process
to contain, control and protect the steel between
the steel ladle (top) and caster.
Various plates, rods, tubes, and linings are em-
ployed and their properties vary widely. All of
these refractories must present the ultimate in

The sliding ladle gate uses air-cooled stainless steel springs to maintain a constant sealing pressure
on the sliding refractory interfaces. A valve mechanism permits rapid opening or closing to replace
or inspect refractory components. Refractories for ladle gates must have excellent resistance to
thermal shock and metal erosion and maintain a smooth surface during use. Depending upon steel
grade, plate life may be single or multiple heats without replacement or inspection. Consistency is
vital because of the severe danger to personnel and equipment.
The tundish nozzle is a critical link in the continuous-casting system because it must deliver a con-
stant and controlled rate of flow of steel to the mold with minimum stream flare to minimize spatter,
spray and atmospheric oxidation. Because the ferrostatic head remains substantially constant in the
tundish throughout casting of much of each heat, the bore of the nozzle must remain at a constant
diameter throughout the cast.
Tundish rods and ladle or tundish shrouds are made from isostatically pressed oxide-carbon com-
binations as illustrated in Table 3.35. These materials must have the ultimate resistance to thermal
shock and erosion from steel and slag in the case of ladle to tundish shrouds or from steel and mold
powders in the case of tundish to mold shrouds. Ladle to tundish shrouds may have lives of single
or multiple heats whereas the tundish to mold shroud may be changed in mid-heat if clogging
occurs from the buildup of deoxidation products such as Al2O3. Argon gas injection is usually sup-
plied in one or more areas of the tundish to mold control system to minimize Al2O3 formation
and/or buildup as shown in Fig. 3.62. This requires that a specific portion of the refractory be pro-
duced with a sufficient permeability to direct the inert gas flow.
Refractory usage in the tundish proper continues to evolve as the tundish is required to remove and
store undesirable materials in the tundish slag or on baffles or filters in the tundish. The refractory
inner linings are thin consumable layers applied between strings of heats of like composition, as in
Fig. 3.63. After each string of heats, the tundish and skull are dumped and a fresh refractory layer
applied. The fresh layer, such as a gunnable MgO layer ~1–2 in. thick, privides a completely clean
material to avoid any possible steel contamination. A monolythic safety lining and insulation pro-
vide for safety and low shell temperatures. The length of the string of heats is largely independent
of the refractory as it depends on allowable slag buildup in the tundish and the need for a particu-
lar steel order.

3.6.3 Refractory Use for Energy Savings
Although refractories always provide a degree of thermal insulation, there are some steel plant
applications where these criteria are more important than containment or steel quality protection.
In slab reheating furnaces, refractories are used over the areas of the skid pipe system not in con-
tact with the slab to decrease energy usage, as illustrated in Fig. 3.64. Special refractory metal
anchoring systems or interlocking refractory shapes are used in this application to resist vibration
and facilitate skid insulation replacement. Fig. 3.65 shows some examples of methods of holding
refractory tile on to a skid pipe system.

In recent years, increased use has been made of various forms of fiber refractory materials in many
types of reheating furnaces because of their good insulating properties and light weight. Such
materials are not suitable in contact with slag or in areas requiring abrasion resistance, but are suit-
able for many less severe areas. Fig. 3.66 shows a plate mill continuous-annealing furnace lined
with fiber blanket held in place with metallic anchors. Refractory type anchors may be used in such
a system to extend the useful temperature of fibers. Fibers may also be used in stackbonded or
modular form where the fibers are folded or fastened to a steel backup plate attached directly to
the steel super-structure. Veneers of fiber are also being evaluated over existing refractory linings
to reduce energy consumption. In all cases, the economies of fiber materials must be carefully eval-
uated in comparison to other insulating materials including insulating brick, insulating castables
and mineral wool or other insulating blocks.

3.7 Refractory Consumption, Trends, and Costs
Some general comments on refractory consumption, costs and trends are made here for illustrative
purposes. Because this type of information changes rapidly with changes in the steelmaking
process, changes in refractory technology, changes in economic conditions, and changes in envi-
ronmental factors, care must be taken to gather updated information for any specific use. Also,
comparing such data between countries (or even companies) must be done only after an under-
standing in the wide differences in conditions. Consideration must be given regarding integrated
and nonintegrated shops and between the types of steel products being produced.
The types of refractories used in recent years trend toward more use of monolithic and special
shaped products with less standard brick being used. This trend reflects the drive for both lower
labor costs and the changes in the process to produce higher quality steel products. Tables 3.36 and
3.37 show the distribution of refractory product types for an integrated and nonintegrated plant in

the United States. Each of these product types show complex trends in refractory use and some of
these will be obvious by reading other chapters which highlight refractory uses in specific cases.
Table 3.38, for example, shows some of the trends in the use of high Al2O3 products in the
steelplant. Iron or steel processing changes have driven such trends as increased use of high Al2O3
materials in blast furnace casthouses which now cast on an almost continuous basis, steel ladle
refractories exposed to more severe conditions during ladle treatment of steels, or the increased use
of stream shrouding devices during casting to prevent oxidation.
The consumption of refractories (in terms of lbs of refractories per ton of steel produced) contin-
ues to decrease both from improved life and because modern processes are ever more productive.
At the same time, the cost of refractories per ton is increased as refractories are improved to meet
the new process conditions. Table 3.39 shows the current refractory consumption in two United
States steelplants. As previously stated, these figures vary widely and comparisons between shops
should not be attempted without a full knowledge of process conditions and parameters. The cost
of refractories produced will also vary widely from $0.20 to over $2.50 per lb depending on com-
position and complexity. The cost of refractories per ton of steel produced for an integrated plant
of the type shown in Table 3.39 would range from $9.00 to $12.00 per ton of steel produced.
It should also be noted that refractory costs are often secondary to other parameters including steel
quality, performance predictability and safety, energy considerations, and environmental criteria.

4.1 Refractories for Oxygen Steelmaking Furnaces†
4.1.1 Introduction
The essential goal in the development of refractory practices for basic oxygen furnaces is to obtain
a useful lining life that will provide maximum furnace availability for the operators to meet pro-
duction requirements at the lowest possible refractories cost per ton of steel produced. To this end,
the operators and refractories engineers seek to optimize their lining design, maintenance prac-
tices, and control of operating practices that are known to affect lining life. In most shops, longer
lining life can result in lower refractories cost, but, in high production shops, longer life achieved
with minimal downtime for maintenance will also enable increased productivity through increased
furnace availability.
To optimize the lining design, most operators try to develop a balanced lining, that is, a lining in
which different refractory qualities and thicknesses are assigned to various areas of the furnace lin-
ing on the basis of a careful study of the wear patterns. In a balanced lining, the refractories are
zoned such that a given segment of lining known to receive less wear is assigned a lower quality
or less thickness of refractory, whereas refractories of greater wear resistance and generally of
higher costs are reserved for those segments of the furnace that will be subjected to the most severe
wear.
The refractory qualities available to use in BOF linings range from pitch-bonded magnesia or
dolomitic types to the advanced refractories that are made with resin bonds, metallics, graphites,
and sintered and/or fused magnesia that can be 99% pure. Bricks are designed with a combination
of critical physical properties to withstand the high temperatures and rapidly changing condi-
tions/environment throughout the BOF heat cycle. A balance of properties such as hot strength,
oxidation resistance, and slag resistance are necessary for good performance.
With the wide variety of available brick qualities, there is a wide range of prices; the more expen-
sive brick can cost as much as six times that of a conventional pitch-bonded brick of the type used
in many furnace bottoms. As lining designs are upgraded and more of the higher priced products

are used in a lining, determining if the changes are cost-effective is important. For example, when
the cost of a lining is increased by 25% in a shop that is averaging 2000 heats, the lining life will
need to increase to 2500 heats for the refractories costs to be maintained. However, in shops where
furnace availability is needed for productivity, a lesser increase in lining life and a higher refrac-
tory cost may be justified if the furnace availability is greater during periods of high production
needs.
As lining designs are upgraded to optimize performance and costs, the effects of operating vari-
ables on lining wear are important to know. With this information, the possibility of controlling
those parameters that affect lining wear adversely and the economic tradeoffs of increasing oper-
ating costs to extend lining life can be better evaluated. In general, the practices that improve
process control, such as sub-lances, will benefit lining life. In addition, lining life is helped by
charging dolomitic lime to provide slag MgO, minimizing the charge levels of fluorspar, control-
ling flux additions and blowing practices to yield low FeO levels in the slags. These practices need
to be optimized to yield the most cost-effective lining performance.
Even when many operating conditions are improved, lining designs are optimized for balanced
wear, and the best brick technology is used, wear does not occur uniformly, and, generally, main-
tenance practices that involve gunning of refractories and coating with slag are used to extend the
life of a lining. See Section 4.2.
The above discussion illustrates some of the many factors that need to be considered in a strategy
for BOF lining performance. Some details that are needed for developing the optimum refractories
practices are provided in the following sections.
4.1.2 Balancing Lining Wear
4.1.2.1 General Considerations
In theory, linings for oxygen furnaces should be designed by refractory type and/or thickness so
that no materials are wasted at the end of a furnace campaign; that is, so that all areas of the fur-
nace are worn to a stopping point such as the safety lining at the same time. In the real case, how-
ever, some areas will show higher wear despite the latest brick technology and efforts to use
internal maintenance techniques. A continuing and dynamic effort is always in progress in any shop
to minimize wear and to provide longer life in these severe wear areas.
4.1.2.2 Areas of Severe Wear
The areas of severe wear are dictated to a large extent by the type of oxygen process involved (top-
blown, bottom-blown, combination-blown, bottom-stirred, etc.). In all oxygen practices, the area
where scrap and hot metal are charged into the furnace (charge pad) is subject to impact and abra-
sion. More uniform wear will occur during the oxygen blowing period on top-blown vessels, but
bottom-blown vessels will be subject to accelerated bottom wear during the blowing period. On
turndown for sampling and tapping, the furnaces (normally to opposite and generally horizontal
positions), localized contact with slag will also produce localized wear. Accelerated wear is also
experienced in the trunnion areas of any oxygen furnace, mainly because this area is the most dif-
ficult to protectively coat with slags or gunning. Other unusual wear areas may result from unique
features of a particular oxygen process; for example, cone wear from post-combustion lances or
the damage inflicted by deskulling.
Fig. 4.1 shows the different areas of a typical oxygen steelmaking vessel, where different types or
thicknesses of refractory may be used to obtain balanced wear.
4.1.2.3 Wear-Rate Measurements
Consistent and predictable lining life is very important to avoid production delays in the steel-
making facility and related operations such as ironmaking, casting, or finishing; predictable life is

also a vital part of a safe and stable operation. For these reasons, a variety of tools have been used
to determine the condition of the lining at any time and to dictate the maintenance required to bal-
ance wear.
The most widely used method currently is a laser-measuring device as illustrated in Fig. 4.2. In this
practice, a laser beam is rebounded off calibrated points on the furnace proper and compared to
points in the worn lining. A computer analysis is then used to plot the remaining lining thickness.
While this information is invaluable in comparing wear rates for different refractories and avoiding
shell damage or breakouts, its primary usefulness is in determining and controlling furnace main-
tenance by gunning. Using the laser as a guide, the areas actually requiring gunning maintenance
can be isolated, and the amount of gunning material required can be controlled. Fig. 4.3 illustrates
one furnace campaign in which rapid trunnion wear was experienced in the first 500 heats.

Gunning was initiated at the indicated approximate rate at that time and continued throughout the
balance of the campaign.
4.1.3 Zoned Linings by Brick Type and Thickness
The previous chapter on refractories described the types of carbon-bearing basic brick available for
use in modern oxygen steelmaking furnaces. The engineers who are responsible for designing
todayís sophisticated vessel linings now may choose from greater than 30 proven compositions to
construct a working lining to meet the service conditions found in a particular vessel. Normally,
five to ten compositions have been found to cover most current operating practices and associated
wear mechanisms.
Fig. 4.4 and Fig. 4.5 describe the zoning used in two types of operations to provide the optimum
refractory behavior. The lining zones may also vary in working lining thickness from some 18 to
30 in. as an additional zoning method.

The zoned lining for a particular shop evolves as the operating conditions change and as new
refractory types and/or maintenance practices are developed. Table 4.1 is an idealized description
of the known wear condition(s) for the several furnace areas along with the best current refracto-
ries for each environment.
4.1.4 Refractory Construction
The refractory constructions in oxygen steelmaking furnaces are relatively simple in comparison
to other refractory applications in that:
a. Tear-out of the spent working lining can be readily accomplished by mechanical
removal of the top brick courses followed by rotation of the furnace to an inverted
position.
b. Only two refractory layers are normally used—a thicker working lining (18–30 in.)
and a thinner safety lining (6–9 in.) for shell protection. (A large part of the safety
lining will last multiple working lining campaigns.)
c. The working lining is installed without mortar while the safety lining is held in
place with steel retainer rings and mortar.
d. In principle, the working lining is installed with minimum brick cutting in a ringed-
keyed construction where the brick are held in place by the brick taper (smaller hot-
face than cold-face).
In reality, the brick construction in actual vessels is more complex as illustrated in Figs. 4.6
through 4.11. Fig. 4.6 and Fig. 4.7 show cross-sections of the refractory construction in typical top

and bottom-blown furnaces, respectively. Note that the refractory construction is simple keyed
rings for the cone, stadium and barrel sections, but involves other shapes in the furnace bottom
areas. These more complex shapes are, however, still layered entirely dry (no mortar) and close
dimensional requirements are necessary for all such shapes. Fig. 4.8 shows alternate methods of
construction for the area surrounding the removable bottoms of bottom-blown furnaces. The inner
rings of these furnace linings are often replaced when bottoms are installed.

Fig. 4.9 shows the construction of a removable bottom where brick are layered around bottom tuy-
eres in a manner that only one tuyere is contained in a given brick row to avoid stress buildup in
the refractories. As shown in Fig. 4.10, two special shapes are used to obtain a tight fit around the
tuyere itself. The construction and operation of tuyeres have been discussed in prior chapters.
Similar complex constructions may be required when bottom stirring by inert gas injection is used.

Fig. 4.11 shows construction when such inert gas devices (canned bricks, porous bricks, annulus
tuyeres, etc.) are employed.
The previous illustrations were presented to give a flavor of the variety of refractory constructions
possible in oxygen steelmaking furnaces.
As refractory linings become more complex, the increased thermal rigidity of the newer types of
materials resulted in problems with overstressing the refractory and/or steel shell or trunnion sup-
port ring. Many modern linings now incorporate thermal expansion allowance on the brick using
compressible materials such as special tapes between the brick in a given ring (horizontal expan-
sion) and using compressible fibers between rings (vertical expansion). The amounts of such
expansion may be estimated using stress-strain measurements on refractories and computer finite
element analysis.
Relines on oxygen steelmaking furnaces are highly organized and planned to achieve furnace turn-
around times of four to ten days, depending on other work done on the furnace auxiliaries at the
same time.

4.1.5 Furnace Burn-In
The refractories in all types of oxygen steelmaking furnaces are heated rapidly to avoid unneces-
sary carbon oxidation from the brick. Fig. 4.12 shows a typical burn-in of four hours followed by
immediate charging of the first heat. As described in Chapter 8, fuel for the burn-in is provided by
coke charged on the furnace bottom and burned by the oxygen lance and/or by fuels through the
tuyeres in a bottom-blown furnace.
4.1.6 Wear of the Lining
Wear of the lining is a complex process as illustrated in Fig. 4.13. As shown, wear may occur by a
combination of various physical and chemical parameters and can be expected to differ not only by
inherent differences in the process, (for example, top vs. bottom-blown) but also from site-specific
parameters such as vessel shape or hot metal composition. The following is a brief discussion of
some of the parameters which may affect lining wear.
4.1.6.1 Considerations of Slag Formation
Slags are a necessary part of steelmaking in that they remove impurities, such as sulfur and phos-
phorus, from hot metal. However, slag attack is the main mechanism of wear to a BOF lining. The

considerations of slag formation begin with the scrap and hot metal composition. In the following
section, only the hot metal composition, the primary source of many of the oxide constituents in
the slag, will be addressed. The components of most concern in the hot metal are:  sulfur, phos-
phorus, silicon, manganese, and titanium. During the blow, liquid slags are formed by the oxida-
tion of the metallic components of the molten metal (including iron), coupled with the addition of
fluxes, such as CaO (burned lime), MgO (burned dolomitic lime), and CaF2 (fluorspar or spar).
The fluxes serve two purposes—they aid in achieving the proper chemical composition to remove
sulfur and phosphorus from the metal bath, and, except for fluorspar, they protect the lining from
attack by FeO and SiO2.
The main constituents of slag are:  SiO2, CaO, MgO, FexOy, TiO2, MnxOy, P2O5, and CaF2. The
composition of the slag is shown in Fig. 4.14. The oxidation of silicon to form silica occurs early
in the process and is very rapid. The FeO and manganese oxide are also formed early in the blow.

The percentage of FeO decreases as the
blow progresses; however, toward the end,
when the carbon levels are low, FeO will
again increase. Silica reaches a maximum
approximately 20–40% into the blow and
then decreases while CaO continues to dis-
solve in the liquid slag. In the final stages,
as FeO increases rapidly, the percentages of
both CaO and SiO2 are reduced.
The FeO that is formed both oxidizes the
carbon in the carbon-containing refractories
and forms liquids with the calcium silicate
bonding phases found in the magnesite por-
tion of the brick. The oxidation of carbon is
of concern as many BOF refractories are
carbon-bonded, and thus become quite
weak when the carbon is removed. Also,
carbon acts to prevent slag intrusion into
the brick structure, and once the bricks are
decarburized, the slag resistance of the
refractory is diminished significantly.
The silica that is formed early in the blow is
very corrosive to the refractory lining and
reacts with the MgO to form low-melting compounds. Furthermore, as lime is dissolved into the
liquid slag, the early slags, which have a lime-to-silica ratio close to 1.0, are extremely corrosive
to the lining.
CaO must dissolve into the slag quickly to protect the lining for the reasons discussed above and
to aid in removal of impurities from the molten bath. A limiting aspect of the dissolution of lime
is that SiO2 reacts with the CaO to form a dicalcium silicate shell around the lime particle. This
dicalcium silicate layer is very refractory and dissolves slowly.
MgO additions to the slag are well known in reducing slag attack on a BOF lining. Two approaches
are used. The first is to add sufficient MgO via dolomitic lime to guarantee adequate saturation of
the slag throughout the blow. The second approach, which prevails today, is to add more than
enough MgO to saturate the slag. The latter approach results in a buildup on the vessel walls which
can greatly extend lining life when properly used.
Very thick layers of MgO-enriched slag may also be frozen on a specific worn area of the furnace
such as the charge and tap pads. This practice requires some amount of furnace delay and must be
accomplished while the other furnaces in the shop are available.
The reactivity of the lime has an influence on the resulting dicalcium silicate layer formed. A low-
reactivity lime forms heavy, coarsely crystalline and adherent rims while a reactive lime produces
the opposite results. The amount of fluorspar and other fluxes that must be added to dissolve this
rim depends on the reactivity of the lime.
4.1.6.2 Other Factors Affecting Lining Life
A multitude of other factors which may be site or process specific can affect lining life and a brief
review of these parameters may be helpful in understanding differences in lining behavior.
4.1.6.2.1 Hot Metal Differences
Hot metal with higher silicon or phosphorus content will require 
the use of different slag practices and will cause more severe lining wear. Metal pre-treatments 
to reduce sulfur or other impurities greatly simplify slag processing and produce less severe 
conditions.

4.1.6.2.2 Scrap Variations
Processing larger amounts of scrap can complicate slag development and
reduce lining life. Some shops have increased damage from scrap charging because of limitations
in charging equipment design.
4.1.6.2.3 Tap Temperature Requirements
Tap temperature requirements depend on the subsequent
processing to be involved before continuous casting (degassing, refining) and the ability to reheat
steel in ladles. Higher tap temperatures will significantly lower lining life. Some processes also
remove carbon during degassing which can further reduce tap temperatures.
4.1.6.2.4 Reblows and Heat Times
An increased number of reblows and/or longer heat times will also
have significant effects on lowering lining life. Improvements in processing which reduce these
variables (dynamic controls, etc.) will improve lining life.
4.1.6.2.5 Lance/Tuyere Design and Practices
Changes in lance practice and design or improved tuyere
designs can cause substantial changes in refractory behavior.
4.1.6.2.6 Production Rates
Shops operating in a manner to fully utilize furnaces minimize furnace
cycling and improve lining life.
4.1.7 Lining Life and Costs
The current life of oxygen steelmaking furnaces varies widely from 1500 to 15,000 heats. The
longer lining lives are achieved by extensive use of slag splashing to protect the brick lining as will
be described in Section 4.2. Lives of 1500 to approximately 5000 heats can be achieved using brick
linings balanced by refractory gunning and slag patching on a periodic basis. In the gunning
process, refractory materials ranging in MgO content, from 40% to above 90%, are applied pneu-
matically to selected areas of the furnace. The so-called “programmed” gunning is designed to
extend lining life without increasing overall costs or causing delays which would reduce steel pro-
duction. Fig. 4.15 shows a typical campaign where gunning was used starting after approximately
1400 heats to extend the overall life to approximately 3500 heats. Note that the lining was removed
when overall costs started to slightly increase.
The use of improved brick linings, dolomitic lime to promote slag buildup, programmed gunning
and slag splashing or periodic patching have all extended lining lives. These techniques have not

tions have also been achieved so that the current refractory costs of oxygen processes are now only
8–15% of the total refractory costs in the modern steelplant.
4.2 BOF Slag Coating and Slag Splashing
4.2.1 Introduction
For the steel industry, as occurs in other industries, about the time a process appears to plateau in
development, a new infusion of technology takes off and another round of experiments and asso-
ciated technologies are applied to the process. In the past, several areas have been going through
these stages simultaneously—bottom stirring in steelmaking, switching from ingot to continuous
caster production, and resin-bonded magnesia–carbon brick in the refractory sector. While the
emphasis of Section 4.2 is on slag coating and splashing of BOF refractories, the importance of
operations and operational changes on refractory performance cannot be stressed strongly enough
and have been described in recent publications.1,2
4.2.2 Slag Coating Philosophy
Slag coating and splashing substantially contribute to maintaining furnace lining profiles for safety
and performance. Slag coating is an art form that requires considerable attention if it is to be done
most effectively. Actions that make coating practices successful include:  selecting the right slag,
making the right and proper amount of additions, rocking the vessels correctly, disposing of the
slag when necessary, and coating when it is the best time. These items need to be thought out and
well executed.
As in the case of gunning, time to slag coat can often be found, even in most two-vessel operations.
A successful slagging program utilizes established rules, and strict adherence to those rules is a
key. It should be kept in mind that the vessel does not have to look pretty to accomplish long lin-
ing life, Fig. 4.16.
4.2.3 Magnesia Levels and Influences
Magnesia in the slag works against the steelmaking demands such as  yield, phosphorus removal,
and bottom stirring. The trick, therefore, is to maintain the lowest magnesia level required to
accomplish the metallurgical and operational goals and still protect the refractory lining.
The magnesia in the slag is also a very important factor in slag coating technology (with and with-
out slag splashing). It is not desirable to have low magnesia slag on long life vessels. The objec-

tive is to charge more magnesia than the saturation level of the slag to make the slag more refrac-
tory. This results in improved coating characteristics of the slag, so when it is thrown on the vessel
walls, as with slag splashing, it will resist removal by the following heat. Alternate sources of sized
magnesia of +90% are potential materials for slagging pads in combination with the vessel slag.
These magnesia sources are typically lower cost magnesia units and possibly solve basic brick
recycle problems.
Thus far, magnesia levels (MgO) in the 8–11% range have not adversely affected phosphorus
removal in North American melt shops.
4.2.4 Material Additions
Alongside the normal flux charge, there are a number of potential material additions that can be
made at different times in a heat, from beginning to end. A cost effective approach is to use low
cost materials such as limestone or dolomitic stone, slag, ground brick, etc. Also, BOF slag can be
added with the initial flux charge for early slag development. Another early charge technique,
called stone-to-foam, is done for trunnion protection. This utilizes a carbonate limestone or
dolomite to create CO2 gas that aids in the foaming of the slag. When using carbonates, care should
be taken regarding the effect on the offgas system.
Towards the end of a heat, dolomitic lime, dolomite stone, ground-up recycled brick, and magne-
sia are used to cool the slag and condition the slag regarding refractoriness and coating character-
istics. Other materials (magnesia and carbon) are added at the end of the heat to foam the slag,
similar to EAF slagging techniques. A magnesia (MgO) addition may be charged to the slag on
extra low and ultra low carbon steels for additional lining protection.
4.2.5 Equilibrium Operating Lining Thickness
The ideal operating mode of a long life vessel is one where a lining wear equilibrium is reached
and maintained. From experience, thermal equilibrium appears to be established at a lining thick-
ness of 380 mm (15 in.) from a starting thickness of 762 mm (30 in.). The lining settles in between
127 mm (5 in.) and 381 mm (15 in.) of remaining working lining thickness, Fig. 4.17. In most
shops, special attention is paid to the tap pad and the trunnion areas, which may have as little as 25
mm (1 in.) and 76–102 mm (3–4 in.) brick remaining, respectively. These thin areas demand that
the lining be laser-measured a minimum of once a day and as often as every turn, with special
attention being paid to the worn areas. From an operating perspective, a worn vessel produces heats
with increased yield when compared to a new vessel.

4.2.6 Other Refractory Maintenance Practices
Those steps, independent of slag splashing, that will aid the maintenance of BOF linings are pre-
sented in Table 4.2. Note that these are recommended practices that are beneficial with or without
slag splashing as they will extend refractory lining life.
4.2.7 Laser Measuring
It is best to laser-measure the lining thickness once per day to establish the lining status (profile)
and to distribute color coded copies of the lining profile to the furnace crew, vessel pulpit, and
operations management. Areas of the vessel that should be measured daily are the tap pad, the bot-
tom, and the trunnions. When areas of less than 127 mm (5 in.) thickness are noted, an action plan
should be implemented. This plan should include gunning as required, the use of a slag conditioner,
slag coating the lining after every heat in the vessel from nose to nose, and taking a follow-up laser
measurement reading eight hours after the low thickness reading.
Early in the campaign, wear rates on brick can be measured and the influences of the operation can
be determined due to the presence of little or no gunning. Once gunning and slag splashing com-
mences, laser readings are best used to maintain lining/slag thickness.
4.2.8 Slag Splashing
The technique of slag splashing has reduced refractory costs and increased productivity by increas-
ing vessel campaign life to years instead of months. This technology was maximized in the early
1990s and has proven to be cost effective.2 It entails the use of the oxygen lance to blow nitrogen
on the residual slag, after tapping a heat, to coat the walls and cone of the converter with slag, Fig.
4.18. The process has greatly reduced the need for gunning of the lining by more than half. Two
slag splashing practices are known: (1) with the vessel empty of steel and all the slag remaining in
the vessel, as shown in Fig. 4.18, and (2) with the both the molten steel bath and slag in the ves-
sel.3 The latter method is specific in coating the trunnions and the upper reaches of the furnace.
The blowing practices are different for these two techniques.
Slag splashing utilizes the technique of working off a slag coating instead of the working lining
brick or its gunned coating. Slag splashing requires only a minute or two to perform and is done
while the vessel is in a vertical position after a heat is tapped. The nitrogen flows are often auto-
matic and are based on lance height at the start of a splash. Currently slag splashing refinements
are continuing to be optimized, i.e., tuyere cleaning, placing the slag in a specific area, and/or best

slag chemistry for coating. The emissions during the slag splashing period have caused no pollu-
tion problems.
4.2.8.1 Lance Buildup
Because slag splashing tosses the molten slag in all directions, the lance is also coated with slag.
It is quite important that no steel in the vessel is present as it adds to the difficulty of the lance skull
removal. Lance slag buildup removal can be aided by a low pressure water spray that eliminates the
slag. Also, alternating lances has been found to be beneficial in slag removal from the lance.
4.2.8.2 Slag Splashing Augmented by Gunning
To attain extended campaign life on a lining, it is necessary to gun areas that encounter severe wear
such as the trunnions and slag lines. The best refractory costs, as expressed in cost/ton, Fig. 4.19,
are achieved by the selective use of gunning materials.2 In the past, on long campaigns, gunning
material costs could exceed the cost of the original magnesia–carbon lining. Therefore, the use of

the exact amounts of gunning material in the right areas of the vessel, as directed by the laser read-
ings, will yield the overall lowest refractory cost per ton.
Gunning has the potential of being a major improvement area in refractories. It hold great promise
as considerable research is being applied to gunning materials. The shooter-type gun has made the
application process what it should be under the hostile environment of the hot vessel, and with new
gunning materials, it is anticipated that more effective gunning will occur in the future.
4.3 Refractories for Electric Furnace Steelmaking
Refractories for electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking are selected based on operating conditions
and furnace design features that impact refractory performance. Steelmakers use electric arc fur-
naces to produce steel from scrap and/or alternative iron units under similar operating conditions.
The charge is melted, using fluxes to maintain a basic slag chemistry, tapped at roughly 3000°F,
and the furnace is again charged for another heat cycle. These operating conditions require chem-
ically basic refractory products with excellent resistance to high temperature and thermal cycling.
Furnace design features of present day electric melting technology require specialized refractory
linings. There are various design features, but they are broadly grouped into three areas:  tapping
design, side tap vs. bottom tap; power source, AC vs. DC power; and the use of supplemental oxy-
gen to increase the melting rate.
4.3.1 Electric Furnace Design Features
Side tapping electric furnaces have a spout extending from their furnace sidewall to transfer the
heat to the ladle. The spout is refractory lined, and a taphole through the furnace sidewall connects
the furnace interior to the spout. Side tap furnaces tilt approximately 45°, requiring a higher refrac-
tory sidewall lining on the tap side of the furnace to contain the molten steel. See Fig. 4.20 for a
typical side-tapping electric arc furnace. Bottom tapping furnaces have their taphole through the
bottom hearth section of the furnace and require special taphole refractory products. Bottom tap-
ping also enables reduced height refractory sidewalls due to the reduced tapping tilt angle of
approximately 15–20°. See Fig. 4.21 for typical bottom-tapping furnace.
Alternating current (AC) power sources require three electrode columns within the furnace for the
three electrical phases. These three electrodes have increased arc flare during operation that can

impinge on the refractory sidewalls, resulting in hot spots which must be addressed by refractory
design. AC furnaces also require three holes through the refractory roof and the center section of
the refractory roof between the electrodes is often an area that limits furnace performance. Direct
current (DC) furnaces utilize a single electrode through the roof with the electric arc passing
directly to the steel bath that contacts the bottom anode electrode to complete the electrical circuit.
DC furnaces have less arc flare to the refractory sidewalls and therefore no hot spots. Roof design
is also less complicated with less difficult operating conditions. However, the furnace hearth must
contain the bottom electrode, which complicates refractory design there.
The use of supplemental oxygen lances and burners to increase melt rates impacts refractory
design and performance. Oxygen directed from lances or burners can be deflected by scrap or
charge materials and impinge on the refractory lining, resulting in localized overheating and rapid
refractory wear. Localized oxidizing conditions can also occur which cause rapid refractory lining
erosion.
4.3.2 Electric Furnace Zone Patterns
Even with the individual differences of operating conditions and furnace features, EAF steelmak-
ing can be broken down into specific zones that have differing refractory requirements. These
zones within the furnace, the specific operating conditions for that zone, and the analysis for
refractory lining selection are discussed below. Fig. 4.20 shows the zones for side tapping electric
furnaces; Fig. 4.21 for bottom tapping furnaces. Key zones of EAF steelmaking furnace are first,
the hearth, which contains the molten steel as well as the initial charge materials. The furnace
slagline is the transitional area between the hearth and the furnace sidewall. The upper sidewall is
the refractory portion of the furnace walls above the slagline and below the water-cooled panels.
The taphole is the opening that permits the molten steel to exit from the furnace. The roof has a
refractory portion, occasionally referred to as the delta, which provides openings for the elec-
trode(s) to enter the furnace, and an opening for furnace exhaust fume to exit the furnace to a bag
house. Relative refractory consumptions by zone are presented in Fig. 4.22.
4.3.2.1 Hearth
The hearth zone of an EAF must contain molten steel at high temperature and resist the impact of
heavy charge materials. In addition the hearth must withstand corrosion by molten slag as the fur-
nace is drained. A typical EAF uses a two component refractory hearth of approximately 9 in. of

brick as a safety hearth against the bottom steel shell and 12 to 24 in. of monolithic magnesite as
a working hearth. The safety lining brick should be 90–97% MgO content. These brick have the
strength and slag resistance capability to contain the molten bath in the unlikely event steel or slag
penetrates the monolithic working hearth. The safety hearth brick function as a permanent lining
and would be changed infrequently, possibly every year or two. The monolithic hearth material is
also a high magnesia product (60–95% MgO) and is a dry granular material. The grain sizing of
the hearth material is formulated to compact easily by using vibration equipment during installa-
tion. High temperatures from the initial heat of steel causes sintering—bonding, densification and
strengthening—in the monolithic hearth product, and the hearth becomes quite strong and pene-
tration resistant. The hearth lining is designed so that approximately the top third of the thickness
of the monolithic material is fully sintered, while the middle third of the lining is only partially sin-
tered and the bottom third of the monolithic material against the safety lining brick is unsintered.
This layering effect facilitates patching the hearth refractories when steel or slags damage the
hearth through penetration or corrosion. The damaged area can be cleaned out by removing the
penetrated, sintered magnesite and repaired with new monolithic material, which sinters in place
forming an effective patch.
In DC electric arc furnaces the hearth refractory design must incorporate a bottom electrode.
Operating conditions for the bottom electrode refractories are severe. Localized high temperatures
and extreme turbulence are common at the surface of the bottom electrode. These conditions
require refractories with high temperature stability and strength. For DC furnaces using pin or fin
bottom electrodes, the same dry vibratable magnesite product can be used; although some steel-
makers prefer a more temperature resistant, higher MgO product for the electrode. DC furnaces
with bottom electrodes using larger diameter pins or billets often use special brick shapes sur-
rounding each pin or billet to form the bottom electrode. Another design utilizes conductive refrac-
tories, either brick or monolith, which are a combination of magnesite and carbon, to carry the
electrical current from the bath to the copper electrical connections at the bottom of the furnace.
Conductive refractories are a complicated blend of high purity magnesia, graphite, and powdered
metals to achieve the required combination of high temperature refractoriness and electrical con-
ductivity to contain the molten steel as well as conducting current. (Bottom tapping electric fur-
naces also have a taphole through the hearth, but their refractory considerations will be covered in
Section 4.3.2.4 on tapholes.)
4.3.2.2 Slagline
The slagline of electric arc furnaces is the transitional area between the hearth and upper sidewall.
This area is subject to high temperatures from exposure to the electric arc, oxidation and flame

impingement from supplemental oxygen injection, and most importantly, slag attack from high
temperature slags containing FeO, SiO2, and MnO. Slagline refractory design in the electric fur-
nace is a combination of brick and monolithic products. Most common is a slagline 12 to 18 in. in
thickness using magnesia–carbon brick with 10–20% carbon content. The carbon phase of the
brick is composed of graphite and a carbonaceous resin bond. These carbon materials have excel-
lent resistance to attack by steelmaking slags and have excellent high temperature resistance.
However, the carbon is susceptible to oxidation. Often powdered metallic aluminum, silicon, or
magnesium are added to the slagline magnesia–carbon brick to protect the carbon from oxidation.
These metallics combine with carbon to form carbides which are more oxidation resistant and
strengthen the refractory brick as well. Strength is important to resist the erosive action of molten
slag and steel washing against the slagline zone in the furnace. Magnesia–carbon brick in the
slagline are additionally protected by monolithic refractories. Initial installation of the monolithic
hearth usually covers all or part of the slagline brick. However, this hearth material corrodes or
erodes rapidly due to the difficult operating conditions in this zone of the furnace. Additional pro-
tection for the slagline is afforded by injecting a magnesite gunning mix into the furnace and build-
ing up a protective layer on the slagline. Again, this protective layer does not last long and must be
replaced at regular intervals depending on the severity of the operating conditions.
4.3.2.3 Upper Sidewall
The upper sidewall zone of electric arc furnaces is lined with magnesia–graphite brick of a simi-
lar quality to the brick used in the slagline. The upper sidewall is subject to arc flare (very high
temperatures) and impingement by heavy scrap during the charging process. During the tapping
process, as the furnace tilts, molten steel and slag contact the upper sidewall brick on the tap side
of the furnace. Lastly, upper sidewall brick must be able to withstand corrosion by steelmaking
slags and flame impingement from oxygen lances and oxy-fuel burners. Magnesia–carbon brick of
5–20% carbon give cost effective service in upper sidewall linings. Various qualities and purities
of magnesite, graphite, and powdered metals are utilized. In AC electric arc furnaces, which have
hot spots in the upper sidewall, higher quality brick are used in the hot spots. These higher quality
products are based on fused magnesia grain compared to the sintered magnesite grain in standard
quality brick products. The fused magnesia brick have improved high temperature resistance but
are considerably more costly.
4.3.2.4 Taphole Refractories
Taphole refractories are required for both side tapping and bottom tapping electric furnaces.
Operating conditions in both types of furnaces are similar; hot molten steel, and to a lesser degree
slag, flowing through a 5 to 8 in. diameter hole at considerable velocity erodes the refractories in
the taphole. In the side-tapping furnace the taphole refractories have several alternative designs.
The first and simplest design is to leave an opening in the sidewall brickwork while constructing
the refractory lining. Then when all brickwork is completed, either a refractory taphole sleeve or a
steel pipe is positioned in the taphole opening. Then MgO-based gunning mix is used to fill in the
void between the sleeve or pipe and the adjacent brickwork. A second alternative is to use a large
taphole assembly with a pre-formed taphole. This assembly is set in place in the furnace prior to
installing the sidewall brickwork. Once the taphole assembly is properly positioned, the adjacent
brickwork is completed, creating a tight fit between sidewall brickwork and the taphole assembly.
Refractory products are always high quality in the taphole. If the taphole is constructed with gun-
ning mix sprayed around a steel pipe mandrel, the highest quality magnesia gunning mix is used.
This product has maximum strength and erosion resistance to minimize the erosive action of the
molten steel. If a taphole assembly is used or a refractory sleeve, these are also of high quality mag-
nesia brick with carbon and metals. Metallic additions to magnesia–carbon taphole brick assem-
blies provide added strength and oxidation resistance in this critical application. The side-tapping
furnace has a spout extending from the taphole to enable the molten steel to flow into the ladle.
The spout is a precast monolithic runner shape placed in the runner steel shell during lining con-
struction. This precast runner shape is made from a magnesia based castable if furnace operating

practices result in slag entering the taphole and the furnace runner; the slag resistance of MgO is
required to counteract slag attack. On the other hand, if furnace operating practices limit the intro-
duction of slag into the taphole and runner, then high strength, high alumina castables are used for
the precast runner. These high alumina runners generally last longer due to improved thermal shock
resistance and higher strength as compared to magnesite precast runners.
Bottom-tapping electric arc furnaces require specially designed taphole sleeves and an end block
to comprise the taphole design. The taphole sleeves sit within the hearth in a taphole seating
assembly. The assembly can be constructed from either brick shapes or precast shapes which result
in a roughly 18 in. diameter hole through the furnace hearth refractories. The taphole sleeves are
centered within the taphole seating assembly and a basic castable or ramming mix is tamped in the
annular opening between the sleeves and the seating blocks. Taphole sleeves are magnesia–carbon
shapes made from high purity magnesia or fused magnesia grain and with 10–15% carbon content.
Powdered metals are used as a strengthening agent to maximize erosion and oxidation resistance.
The bottom of the taphole extends beyond the furnace shell utilizing a shape called an end block.
This end block is a similar magnesia–carbon brick that is held in place by an end block casting
attached to the furnace. The end block is exposed to the atmosphere outside the furnace and must
have excellent oxidation resistance as well as maximum erosion resistance to withstand the erosive
action of the taphole stream. The end block is most often the limiting factor in taphole perfor-
mance. As refractory erosion occurs the tap stream begins to flare, increasing reoxidation of the
steel. It is necessary to then do a hot repair to replace the end block and taphole sleeves. Typical
taphole life in bottom tapping furnaces is 5–10 days of operation.
4.3.2.5 Roof
Electric arc furnace roof refractories for both AC and DC furnaces are generally high strength, high
alumina (70–90% Al2O3) precast shapes. Because the roof lifts and swings away from the furnace
body during the charging process, refractories in the roof experience excessive thermal shock. The
lesser thermal expansion of high alumina castables compared to basic castables offer an advantage
in withstanding thermal shock. In addition, high alumina castables are much stronger than basic
castables; therefore high alumina roofs are better able to resist the stresses developed as the roof is
lifted and moved during furnace operations. Electric furnace roof refractories last anywhere from
less than a week to up to ten weeks in some steelmaking operations. The roof also enables furnace
exhaust fumes to exit the furnace and be transported to a baghouse for dust control. While the
immediate exit from the furnace is usually water cooled, there is a refractory lined zone in the duct
system. Refractories in the exhaust ductwork must be capable of withstanding slag carryover and
slag abrasion from particulate-laden gases moving at high velocity. Refractories in the ductwork
are 50–70% alumina brick or fireclay/high alumina gunning mix (40–60% Al2O3). Both of these
materials have the required combination of thermal shock resistance and slag resistance to with-
stand the operating conditions.
4.3.3 Electric Furnace Refractory Wear Mechanisms
4.3.3.1 Corrosion
Electric furnace refractories are subject to a variety of wear mechanisms which must be understood
to properly design and manage electric furnace refractory systems. The most important wear mech-
anism is corrosion. This is the chemical reaction of metallic oxides in the slag, iron oxide (FeO),
silica (SiO2), or manganese oxide (MnO), with the refractory products. Magnesia from the refrac-
tory lining is soluble in the steelmaking slag, with saturation levels varying from 6 to 14%, depend-
ing on temperature and FeO content. These chemical corrosion reactions result in wearing away the
furnace refractory lining; the products of reaction become part of the slag. Corrosion reactions can
be minimized by neutralizing FeO with fluxes and controlling the oxygen content of the slag.
Another way to control corrosion is to use refractory brick that contain carbon. This carbon in the
refractory lining deoxidizes corrosive slag at the refractory/slag interface, minimizing lining cor-
rosion.

4.3.3.2 Oxidation
A second critical wear mechanism in electric arc furnace linings is oxidation. In this process, car-
bon in the refractory lining is oxidized by reacting with oxygen or FeO in the slag. As the carbon
in the refractory lining reacts, the brick loses its strength and is washed away. This carbon oxida-
tion mechanism also occurs at the cold face of the brick if there are holes in the steel shell. Oxygen
from the air reacts with the brickís carbon, and the back part of the brick lining turns to powder.
4.3.3.3 Erosion
Erosion is another prevalent refractory wear mechanism. This is the physical wearing away of the
refractory due to molten steel or slag moving over the face of the refractory lining and physically
abrading or eroding the lining. Erosion is most common in electric arc furnace tapholes, slaglines,
roof electrode openings, and in the offtake ductwork.
4.3.3.4 Melting
Melting is also a common wear mechanism in the electric arc furnace. The unshielded electric arc
generates temperatures that are well beyond the melting point of all commercial refractories.
Melting is the simple phase change of the refractory from solid to liquid, and the liquid phase is
easily washed away. Melting is a serious problem in electric arc furnace linings if not detected and
corrected immediately.
4.3.3.5 Hydration
Because water cooling is used extensively in modern electric arc furnaces, there are occasional
water leaks. Refractories are easily damaged by water or steam due to hydration of the magnesia
or lime phases in the refractory product. Hydration results in expansion of the individual grains
comprising the refractory lining. These grains grow and burst, disrupting the lining.
4.3.3.6 Spalling
A more subtle refractory wear mechanism is known as spalling. In this type of wear, rapid heating
or cooling of the refractory lining cause stresses in the refractory lining. These stresses often
exceed the inherent strength of the refractory material, resulting in cracking. As these cracks inter-
sect, chunks of refractory fall out of the lining. This condition is most common on furnace roofs
that are opened and closed to expose the refractory portion of the roof to cold air.
4.3.4 Conclusion
Refractory lining systems for EAF steelmaking are selected using a thorough knowledge of both
operating conditions in the furnace and the impact of electric arc furnace design features.
Refractory wear mechanisms can be minimized by a similar understanding of furnace operating
conditions and their interaction with the available refractory products. As electric melting technol-
ogy advances, refractory systems must be improved or developed which can counteract the increas-
ingly difficult operating conditions.
4.4 Refractories for AOD and VOD Applications
4.4.1 Background
In the past 30 years, the AOD and similar type processes (CLU, ASM, K-OBM-S etc.) and the
VOD, have become the dominant methods for the production of stainless steels throughout the
world. In 1995, the total worldwide production of stainless steels was reported to be 14.9 million
metric tons.4 Over 85% of the stainless steel produced was through the AOD vessel or related
processes. The balance was produced via various VOD ladle processes.

Dolomite and dolomite–magnesia brick are the most common (> 75% worldwide) refractory lin-
ing for the AOD vessel, but with significant magnesia–chrome and small amounts (< 2%) of mag-
nesia–carbon brick also being used. In VOD ladle applications the same types and grades of
refractories are used, but with more equal amounts of magnesia–chrome and dolomite–magnesia
based brick, with the worldwide consumption estimated at 45% magnesia–chrome, 40%
dolomite–magnesia and 15% magnesia–carbon brick. Monolithic refractories are not currently
used as primary linings in AOD or VOD applications.5
4.4.2 AOD Refractories
4.4.2.1 Introduction
The types of refractories used in the AOD have evolved since the first AOD was put into commer-
cial operation at Joslyn Stainless Steel, Ft. Wayne, Indiana in 1968. Magnesia–chrome refractories
were initially used in the AOD, ranging from 60% MgO direct-bonded magnesia–chrome for use
in the barrel to rebonded fused grain 60% MgO tuyere pads. In the early 1970s, the first dolomite
based bricks were used in Europe.6 The first dolomite lining used in the U.S. was in 1976. Since
those initial trials, dolomite refractories have become predominant in AOD applications for three
main reasons:  economics; longer lining life—experience with dolomite based linings has shown
that most vessels achieve or exceed lining life obtained with other basic refractories; and metal-
lurgical benefits—the very basic nature of dolomite refractories allows the steelmaker to operate with
higher basicity ratio slags, (CaO + MgO)/(SiO2 + Al2O3) > 1.4, which improves chrome recovery,
and desulfurization.7,8 Dolomite bricks are chrome-free, enabling the steel producer to make both
stainless and low alloy or chrome-free steel in a single AOD.
For those AOD applications which run at lower basicities, magnesia–chrome refractories may give
lower overall costs. The factors governing the choice of magnesia–chrome over dolomite are 
generally lower slag basicities (< 1.4), extensive use of alternative alloy sources (recycled high-
alloy slag, or direct reduction of chrome or manganese ore in the vessel), high process tempera-
tures (> 1800°C), and local availability of competitively-priced magnesia–chrome refractories.
4.4.2.2 Life and Wear Rates
Each area of the vessel is subjected to different types of wear mechanisms. The primary wear
mechanisms for AOD refractories can be classified as follows:  corrosion by decarburization and
reduction slags that can vary widely in basicity; erosion as a result of turbulence created in the
tuyere region; thermal shock due to temperature variations during and between heats; and metal
attack resulting from chemical reactions with strong reductants and fuels (Si, Al).
Life in the AOD vessel is partially a function of vessel size, due to turbulence effects, and ranges
from 30–50 heats in vessels under 50 tons in size to greater than 120 heats in 90 ton and larger 
vessels. Consumptions range from 5–15 kg of refractory/ton of steel. Typically the highest
wear/failure area is in the AOD sidewall tuyeres, or bottom tuyeres for a CLU type vessel. Side-
blown vessels experience tuyere area wear rates of 2–8 mm/heat, with 5 mm/heat being typical.
Bottom-blown vessel tuyere wear rates vary from 8–12 mm/heat. In the balance of both vessels,
wear rates are typically 1–4 mm/heat.5
4.4.2.3 AOD Lining Construction and Zoning
4.4.2.3.1 Safety Lining
AOD safety linings are constructed using standard grade, see Fig. 4.23, Table
4.3 and Table 4.4, fired magnesia–chrome or rarely, dolomite brick. Magnesia–chrome is used in
76–100 mm thick, fully mortared arch or bevel construction laid against the shell without insula-
tion. When dolomite brick are used, special non-aqueous mortars must be employed. The cone usu-
ally is constructed without a safety lining in vessels less than 90 tons. Alumina brick or monolithics
are not used for AOD safety linings because they lack sufficient resistance to the operating condi-
tions to allow a heat to be completed on the safety lining without a breakout.

4.4.2.3.2 Working Lining
One key to balancing AOD refractory wear patterns and reducing refrac-
tory cost per ton is careful attention to zoning and tight construction of the working lining. Zoning
options include zoning the refractory lining by brick thickness, composition, or a combination of
both thickness and composition. Fig. 4.23 illustrates the typical zoning of an AOD vessel. Dolomite
working linings are typically constructed of straights and keys, laid dry (without mortar) and tight
against the safety lining without expansion allowance. Backfill is only used where small gaps exist
between the working and safety linings, especially in the stadium area. Sizing tolerances for dry
dolomite linings must be tighter than 61 mm, and are commonly 60.8 mm. Magnesia–chrome lin-
ings frequently use mortared construction. If mortared construction is not used with mag-
nesia–chrome, expansion allowances may be needed.
4.4.2.3.3 Bottoms
Two types of bottom refractory construction are used in AOD vessels, flat and
dished. Flat bottoms are simple to install, usually requiring only one size of straight sided brick.
Dished bottoms require two to three keys and/or straight shapes, see Fig. 4.24. The main advantage
of using the dished bottom design is that several tons of increased volume can usually be gained.
The keyed construction also helps to retain the bottom refractories in position as the brick wears.
Dolomite bottoms are laid dry, and dusted with dolomite fines. Magnesia–chrome bottoms are usu-
ally laid with mortar. The perimeter of the bottom (under the sidewalls) is rammed with monolithic

Alumina or chrome-based monolithics are used with magnesia–chrome linings, and should have a
continuous service rating of >1700°C.
4.4.2.3.4 Tuyere Zone—Knapsacks
Because of the high wear rate in the tuyere area, increasingly
longer refractories (up to 1000 mm) are being used to extend vessel campaign life. However,
longer tuyere pads in standard AOD shell designs can result in unexpected side effects, such as a
reduction in vessel volume, increased slag splashing and changes in lining wear patterns. One
method to increase the tuyere length without sacrificing vessel volume is the use of the knapsack.
Also referred to as a doghouse or pod, an example is shown in Fig. 4.9. In the stadium section,
notice the use of two bricks, one in front of the other. Using this construction technique allows a
greater total tuyere pad length.
The tuyere brick and pad experience thermal shock from gas cooling, erosion from turbulence, and
extremes in temperature from oxidation reactions. Corrosion from the reaction products may also
contribute to wear. In this area the best grade of available refractory is used. In dolomite linings,
the tuyere brick are usually high-density, low permeability with increased MgO levels and addi-
tions of ZrO2 for thermal shock resistance. The one or two guard bricks immediately surrounding
the tuyere are frequently of the same composition. The balance of the tuyere pad is usually con-
structed using slightly less premium brick to save costs. The tuyere pad typically extends up to the
vessel slagline and encompasses 160–180 degrees of circumference. Magnesia–chrome tuyere/pad
compositions employ either fused-grain or chrome oxide enriched bricks fired to temperatures
>1750°C.

4.4.2.3.5 Walls and Slagline
The second highest wear area of the AOD vessel is the slagline, espe-
cially in the trunnion area. This area is under constant contact with slag in all vessel positions. If
the slag chemistry is less than optimum, wear will occur from chemical corrosion combined with
some erosion. Dolomite linings use a good grade of MgO-enriched brick in this area. The balance
of the wall is constructed with standard grade brick.
4.4.2.3.6 Vessel/Cone Flange and Seal
Several techniques are used for sealing the joint between the
vessel and cone flange, see Fig. 4.25. The method used depends on flange design, the height of the
last barrel course and whether the cone is bricked separately. If a basic monolithic seal material,
see Table 4.5, is used between bricks, as shown in Fig. 4.25, the seal thickness at the brick hot face
should be 25–75 mm. Fig. 4.25 also shows the use of a cut flange brick. Magnesia–chrome linings
may use either the dolomite material from Table 4.5 or a 90% alumina plaster.
4.4.2.3.7 Cone
The cone is the lowest wear area and frequently may be reused on a second vessel
with minor repairs to the tapping side. The cone is constructed with standard grade keys using cor-
belled construction, being dry for dolomite and mortared for magnesia–chrome. Large dolomite-
lined vessels often use a double-chamfered (or parallelogram key) lining in the cone. This
construction is faster and more stable than standard keys. Vessels <15 tons in size may use cast
magnesia or alumina monolithic cones.
4.4.2.3.8 Pour Spouts
Fig. 4.23 shows an example of a monolithic pour spout. Pour spouts help to
concentrate the metal stream and help to reduce nitrogen pickup in the steel during tapping. Other
benefits of monolithic pour spouts include increased metal yield, optimized slag-off, easy slag
deskulling and reduced cone steelwork maintenance. Table 4.5 lists the properties of some basic
monolithic spout compositions. 
4.4.2.4 Preheating of Linings
Fig. 4.26 shows the recommended preheat curve for all AOD linings. The preheat begins with a
temperature rise of 60°C per hour up to 650°C. At this point the lining is soaked for four hours,
after which heating should continue at 65°C per hour up to 1100°C. If time does not permit a soak
period, the cycle can go to 65°C per hour after 650°C has been reached. Linings should be held at
1100°C for >4 hours prior to being placed in service. Reheating of a used lining can be at a rate of
65° to 95°C per hour up to 1100°C.

4.4.2.5 Process Variables Significantly Affecting Life
It is necessary to optimize certain process variables in order to maximize the performance of AOD
refractories. Slag chemistry and fluidity control in the AOD during all refining steps is important
to maintain good refractory life. This requires that sufficient levels of lime and magnesia are pre-
sent in the slag. The optimum slag conditions are similar for all three major refractory types,
although dolomite and magnesia–carbon are more tolerant of high basicities. Slags with V-ratios
>1.4 are compatible with basic AOD refractories and can be important with regards to metallurgical
considerations. Other operational parameters that need to be controlled in order to improve refractory
life include process temperatures <1700°C, tuyere and knurdle control, and short average heat times.
With improper control of tuyere and slag conditions, tuyere area wear rates can exceed 20 mm/heat.
4.4.2.5.1 Slag Control
The control and predictability of the slag chemistry throughout the AOD
process is critical for optimizing refractory wear and metallurgical control.
The type of refractory used in the AOD will influence the slag practice. If a magnesia–chrome
refractory is used, good refractory life is generally obtained if V-ratios are in the range of 1.2 to
1.5. Operating with higher slag basicities will have a detrimental affect on these refractories due to
chemical corrosion of the chrome component of the brick.
In comparison, a dolomite-lined AOD vessel requires slags having higher basicities (V-ratios 1.4
to 2.0). One of the reasons for the extensive use of dolomite linings in the AOD is that several met-
allurgical benefits can result by operating with higher slag basicities. These benefits include better
desulfurization potential and alloy recovery. In Fig. 4.27, the effect of higher reduction slag basic-
ities on chrome recovery is shown.

Fig. 4.26 Recommended AOD preheat schedule for all refractory linings.

The following is a synopsis of AOD slag practices with dolomite linings.
4.4.2.5.1.1 Transfer Slag
Control of transfer slag chemistry and volume brought to the AOD is
important if proper slag control is to be maintained. Highly variable transfer slags make it difficult
to calculate the proper amount of flux additions necessary in the vessel. If possible, the transfer
slag should be CaO and MgO-saturated, so that the initial slag in the vessel is basic and can neu-
tralize the acidic oxides generated during the oxygen blow. If the transfer slag is acidic and the
amount of slag is variable, erosion of the AOD refractory lining will start at the beginning of the
process.
4.4.2.5.1.2 Decarburization Slag
Slag control during the decarburization blow is critical if maximum
refractory life is to be obtained. At the beginning of this stage, corrosive slags with high levels of
SiO2, Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 are generated. In order to neutralize the acidic oxides, CaO and MgO should
be added as a pre-charge material, or very early in the blow. The role of MgO is to react with the
metallic oxides of Cr, Mn, Fe and Al. Their reaction with MgO forms solid or near-solid complex
spinels during decarburization and limits corrosion of the lining. It is recommended that the CaO
source be in the form of dolomitic lime. Part or all of the MgO can come from dolomitic lime, how-
ever this can result in additional slag volume. Decarburization slags that are fluid have insufficient
CaO and MgO levels and can be corrosive to dolomite linings. Typical MgO content of stainless
decarburization slags is in the 10 to 20% range.
4.4.2.5.1.3 Reduction Slag
During the reduction stage, the AOD slags change considerably. The solid
MgO spinel phases disappear as the metal oxides of Cr, Mn, etc. are reduced by silicon or alu-
minum back into the bath. The SiO2 and Al2O3 generated during reduction must be neutralized with
CaO to minimize corrosion of the dolomite lining. The lime also serves to tie up the SiO2 and effec-
tively reduce any reaction with the transition metals. Reduction slags for silicon-killed practices
should target V-ratios of 1.6 to 1.8, with an MgO content of 8 to 12%. Better refractory life, desul-
furization and alloy recovery can be achieved with V-ratios >2.0.
If aluminum is used during reduction or as a fuel, maintaining CaO saturation is critical if
Dolomite refractory wear is to be minimized. Slags with high Al2O3 content can dissolve more lime
and will do so from the dolomite refractory lining unless enough lime is added. Table 4.6 shows

the effect of Al2O3 content in the slag on lime demand. If CaO saturation is not possible, higher
MgO levels in the slag are required for refractory protection.
4.4.2.5.2 Tuyere Knurdle Control
Consistent control of knurdle length and shape is essential for pre-
venting premature failure of the refractory tuyere zone. Knurdle size is controlled by making
adjustments to shroud gas pressure and/or flow. A large knurdle, indicating excessive shroud pres-
sure, can become plugged and misdirect the gas stream toward the refractory lining. A small knur-
dle or no knurdle at all, resulting from low shroud pressure, will not protect the tuyere and can
result in tunneling of the tuyere brick. Optimum knurdle size depends on the individual shop con-
ditions, but generally, 25 to 75 mm is best.
If as little as 2% oxygen is present in the shroud gas, the cooling effect can be reduced and tuyere
brick tunneling may begin to occur.
4.4.2.5.3 Temperature
Temperature can have a significant impact on the amount of CaO and MgO
needed to saturate slags during reduction. Higher CaO and MgO levels are needed if processing
temperatures are higher. If adjustments are not made, dissolution of the refractory lining by the slag
will occur. In Table 4.7, the affect of temperature on lime and MgO requirements for saturation is
shown.
The bath temperature becomes elevated under normal conditions by metallic oxidation of the bath
as the carbon content reduces to lower levels. The temperature of the bath can also be increased by
oxidation of fuels (aluminum or silicon) during a reblow. A reblow to achieve temperature
increases of 20°C or higher, however, is equivalent in refractory wear to making another heat on
the lining. Temperature control is best accomplished by keeping transfer metal temperature and
chemistry levels consistent and controlling the peak temperature at the end of the oxygen blow by
varying the O2/inert gas ratios.
An excessive inert gas stir for temperature reduction can also adversely affect refractory perfor-
mance. Extended stirs can form long, pipe-like knurdles that will sag from their own weight. When
these long knurdles bend over, the injected gases are directed downward during the early stage of
the next heat, and tuyere pad or bottom erosion may occur.
4.4.2.5.4 Back Tilt
Gas injected through the tuyeres tend to roll back and up along the sidewall, 
carrying the products of oxidation with it. The gas stream creates localized high temperature and

turbulence resulting in a high wear area. Back tilting the vessel during blowing keeps the gas
stream further away from the wall, helping to reduce wear. Optimum back tilt is usually between
5° to 7°. A fan shaped wear pattern, starting around the tuyere and extending upward and outward,
generally indicates an improper back tilt practice.
4.4.3 VOD Refractories
4.4.3.1 Introduction
As mentioned in the Section 4.4.1, the VOD process uses more linings of fired magnesia–chrome
brick than of fired or resin-bonded dolomite–magnesia primarily because of the use of highly vari-
able multiple slag processes, and secondarily because of much more thermal cycling than in the
AOD. Some of these slags are very fluid or insufficiently basic, (CaO 1 MgO)/(SiO2 1
Al2O3)<<1.4, for optimum life with dolomite refractories.
The choice of brick composition, especially in the slagline, is controlled by the acceptable carbon
pickup during processing, the acceptable bath chrome pickup, and slag chemistries. Where carbon
pickup from the brick in the range of ~0.2 ppm per minute (under vacuum) is tolerable, magne-
sia–carbon slaglines are preferred for their wide range of slag compatibility, and have been used to
produce steel as low as 15–30 ppm carbon.9 If carbon pickup is not acceptable, then fired brick
must be used, and for chrome-free alloys, fired magnesia–dolomite brick is the only choice. Where
chrome pickup is allowable, the choice of fired magnesia–chrome or magnesia–dolomite is deter-
mined primarily by slag chemistry.
VOD slags have the requirement of high fluidity, because of the relatively small slag volume, and
the limited stirring energy usable in the ladle. This fluidity may be obtained by having slags with
V-ratios <<1.4, or with higher V-ratio slags by using fluorspar or alumina as fluidizers.
Magnesia–chrome brick generally give better slagline performance against slags having V-ratios
<1.2 or having Al2O3 contents >15%, while magnesia–dolomite is preferred for V-ratios >1.4 and
for slags containing >10% fluorspar.
The effect of slag on the wall refractories is less than in the main slagline, and with the increasing
use of magnesia–carbon slaglines, compatible with a wide range of slags, and tighter control over
the process, and especially thermal cycling, the choice of magnesia–chrome or dolomite-based
wall and bottom linings is becoming primarily economic.
4.4.3.2 Lives and Wear Rates
Life is typically equally short for either type of lining, ranging from 15–25 heats. The primary
wear/failure areas are the slagline, the stirring pad and the stir plug/block itself. Refractory consump-
tion is similar for all refractories, is highly variable between shops and may be as low as 10 kg/ton
or over 30 kg/ton of steel. In the severe areas, slagline and stir pad, wear rates are 7–15 mm/heat.
In the lower wear areas of the walls and bottom, typical rates are 3–7 mm/heat.
4.4.3.3 VOD Lining Construction and Zoning
The selection of refractories for VOD applications should consider the conditions of aggressive
fluid slags, high temperatures (>1750°C), long process and stirring times (>3 hr), and the effects
of vacuum on reducing heat transfer and increasing shell temperatures where the VOD ladle is in
a vacuum tank. Because of the very wide range of processing conditions encountered in VODs,
there is considerable variation in safety and working lining construction. The following typical
design, Fig. 4.28, should be considered the minimum requirement in the absence of a shop refrac-
tory history.
4.4.3.3.1 Safety Lining
The safety lining in a VOD ladle is intended to prevent a steel breakout if
there is a failure of the working lining during the processing, and the quality and construction must
be sufficient to allow one complete heat to be made directly on the safety lining. A VOD ladle
safety lining is generally similar to the safety linings used for ladles used for severe ladle furnace
or tank degasser applications, see Section 4.5.3.

Total thicknesses of 75–150 mm are used consisting of primarily of 70–85% alumina fired brick
in the walls and bottom, with fired 95% magnesia or direct-bonded magnesia–chrome brick com-
monly used in the slagline area for their better slag resistance. The entire brick safety lining should
be installed fully mortared, using arch brick or bevels with a maximum joint thickness of 2 mm.
Monolithic safety linings are also used based on both castable and dry-vibratable alumina or mag-
nesia materials of similar quality to bricks. All safety lining materials for VOD ladles should be
volume stable, be resistant to cyclic oxidation-reduction, and have a continuous service rating
>1650°C.
Where insulation is required to hold shell temperatures below 400°C, 5–8 mm of non-compress-
ible insulating panels are most frequently used between the shell and the main safety lining. Where
less insulation is needed, 20–30 mm of clay or forsterite brick has been used in place of the insu-
lating panels. This requires a corresponding reduction in the thickness of the main safety lining,
but is less expensive. The maximum permissible in-service compression or shrinkage of insulating
materials for VOD ladle applications is ~2 mm. A continuous service rating of >800°C is sug-
gested for VOD insulating materials.
4.4.3.3.2 Backfill
Backfills are sacrificial granular monolithic materials used between the safety
and working linings to absorb working lining thermal expansion, capture metal penetration, and
reduce reactions between the working lining, slag, and safety linings. They generally protect the
safety lining and make removal of the working lining easier. More than 90% of dolomite–magnesia
lined VOD ladles use backfill. Magnesia–chrome lining customarily have no backfill.
Backfill thicknesses of from 10–20 mm are used by placing the working lining brick a desired dis-
tance from the safety lining, and pouring and tamping the backfill into the gap every second
course. Compositions are most commonly 80–85% alumina, with >90% magnesia sometimes used
in the slagline areas. Dolomite-based backfills are also used. Backfills should have a continuous
service rating of 1650°C.
4.4.3.3.3 Working Lining
The primary zones of a VOD working lining, Fig. 4.28, are:  the bottom,
including well blocks, stir plug, and impact pad; walls; sidewall impact and stirring pads; slagline

and hotspots; and the freeboard. These zones do not vary significantly between magnesia–chrome
or dolomite linings. Because of the fluid slags and metal, and extensive stirring, tight sizing toler-
ances are needed for VOD brick. Sizing ranges for resin-bonded compositions are typically less
than 60.5 mm, and for fired brick are typically less than 61.0 mm.
Note: Magnesia–chrome, alumina-based and dolomite-based refractories are normally
not mixed in a single VOD working lining. Under vacuum, destructive interactions may
occur between the CaO in dolomite and the spinels in magnesia–chrome or alumina–
silica phases in alumina refractories. Where the two types of brick are used together, an
interface layer of magnesia–carbon brick should be used. An interface may also be
required if the stir plug block or well block, and their surrounding monolithics, are not
of a refractory type (basic vs. acid) compatible with the adjacent brick. Table 4.5 shows
monolithics suitable for use with dolomite linings. Because VOD conditions greatly
increase the potential for incompatibility reactions, refractory suppliers should be con-
sulted prior to mixing compositions.
4.4.3.3.4 Bottoms
Standard grades of magnesia–chrome and dolomite straight bricks, see Tables 4.3
and 4.4, are used in thicknesses of 187–250 mm. Recently, limited amounts of alumina–magne-
sia–carbon (AMC) brick have been used in bottoms. Any of the common brick patterns, (rowlock,
soldier, semi-herringbone, herringbone), may be used with magnesia–chrome, AMC, or resin-
bonded dolomite for the convenience of fitting around the stir plug and well block. Fired dolomite
brick are usually laid in a semi-herringbone pattern. Bottom brick may be installed under the side-
walls or as a plug bottom. Plug bottoms are easier to repair and/or replace, but expose the mono-
lithics used around the bottom perimeter. Fig. 4.28 shows the most common construction, with the
bottom installed under the sidewalls. The bricks are typically laid dry, with finish grouting or dust-
ing to fill any minor open joints.
4.4.3.3.5 Bottom/Wall Impact Pads
Usually the good-grade of brick is employed in the bottom/wall
impact pad, frequently slightly thicker than the main lining. For dolomite linings, the impact pads
are often made of resin-bonded brick. VOD ladles duplexed with BOFs or EBTs may require either
the best-grade brick or metals-containing magnesia–carbon brick in the bottom pad, because of
more concentrated tap streams.
4.4.3.3.6 Stir Plug/Blocks and Well Blocks
VOD ladles use plug and block compositions similar to
those required in severe LMF and degasser operations, see Section 4.5.5. The conditions of very fluid
slags, high temperatures, and long stirring times cause these areas to be one of the main limitations
on VOD life. A very wide range of compositions are being used, often requiring magnesia–carbon
brick as an interface layer or window to maintain compatibility with the main lining. The current
trend (1998) is to increase the use of basic compositions (magnesia–carbon, magnesia–spinel,
magnesia–zirconia, and magnesia–dolomite) for the blocks, and to use slotted or directional poros-
ity plugs.
4.4.3.3.7 Walls
Standard-grade bricks from 114–250 mm thick are used in the walls. Key or arch
construction is preferred over semi-universals for greater stability when bricks wear thin.
Magnesia–chrome is frequently mortared, while dolomite is laid dry. A majority of dolomite lin-
ings use 10–20 mm of backfill behind the walls. 
4.4.3.3.8 Main Slagline plus Sidewall and Slagline Stir Pads
The best grade of brick is used in these
critical wear areas. Selection of the refractory type is governed by the metallurgical/slag conditions
as discussed above. The use of metals-containing, large crystal size and fused grain magnesia–
carbon brick in slaglines is increasing, even in otherwise carbon-free linings. For VOD applications,
carbon levels are commonly 7–10%, to minimize oxidation and carbon pickup, and anti-oxidants
must be carefully chosen for slag compatibility. Magnesia purity and large crystal size are more
critical in VOD ladles than in other ladle applications.
4.4.3.3.9 Upper Slaglines
As a result of foaming under vacuum, VOD ladles must have an extended
slagline zone. Where a typical LMF ladle may have a 700–1000 mm high slagline, a VOD will use
Steelmaking and Refining Volume
260

1000–1500 mm of slag zone. Most of the additional height is in the upper slagline, which is in
intermittent contact with the low-density foamed vacuum slag. This area typically uses either
20–50 mm thinner brick and/or one grade lower brick than the main slagline. Even when the main
slagline is magnesia–carbon, the upper slagline frequently is fired brick because of the greater oxi-
dation potential in this zone.
4.4.3.3.10 Freeboard
Fired standard-grade brick are used, and are chosen for their oxidation and
thermal cycling resistance. In this low wear area, thickness may be as little as 114 mm.
Construction is usually keys or arches, laid dry and tight against the safety lining without backfill.
In ladles with <800 mm of freeboard, this zone will see some minor slag attack and is usually of a
composition similar to the wall brick. In VOD ladles with >1000 mm freeboard, the upper portion
sees little slag and may even be of 85% alumina brick. The freeboard is an area where dolomite
brick may be used in a magnesia–chrome lining and vice versa.
4.4.3.3.11 Lip Rings
For VOD ladles, the lip ring design is determined by whether the vacuum seal
is on the lip or the ladle is tank degassed. In most VODs, the large freeboard allows the use of alu-
mina brick or castables and pre-formed shapes with alumina-based monolithics. These lip materi-
als should be rated for continuous service at >1700°C. With mortared magnesia–chrome linings,
vertical thermal expansion allowances are not usually needed, but with dolomite–magnesia linings,
vertical expansion allowances of approximately 0.5% should be incorporated in the lip construc-
tion. Many dolomite linings use a dolomite or magnesia-based resin-bonded ram, Table 4.5, which
is temporarily thermoplastic on heatup to provide this relief.
4.4.3.4 Preheating of Linings
Fig. 4.29 presents a schedule that is suitable for all lining types. When there are no carbon-con-
taining brick in the lining, slower preheat rates and longer soaks may be used. Preheat and/or soak
temperatures above 1100°C are not recommended because of brick reactions with the relatively
low melting point VOD slags.

4.5 Refractories for Ladles
4.5.1 Function of Modern Steel Ladle
The modern steel ladle is used in a significantly more complex manner than the older ingot ladles
used simply to transport steel from a furnace to ingot molds. Table 4.8 lists typical functions of the
modern steel ladle.
While the overall purpose of the ladle is still to deliver steel for a caster, steel processing between
the furnace and caster may occur by a complex combination of steel and slag treatments. These
includes furnace slag skimming and the introduction of a new artificial slag, steel alloying and stir-
ring from porous plug and lances, steel reheating using electric arcs, and degassing by various pro-
cedures. These steps must be accomplished without significant refractory wear or influence on any
of the refining processes. Fig. 4.30 illustrates the process steps in one shop where both bloom and
slab heats are produced in degassed or regular grades. The increased number of process steps in
ladles means that, in essence, they function as traveling components of skimming, stirring, reheat-
ing, and degassing processes. Also the exposure time for a given heat has expanded from two to
five times of that for ingot teeming.
The ladle lining can also influence the quality of the steel produced in the lining if oxygen is picked
up from the lining during any stage of processing. Linings containing SiO2 in uncombined forms

can cause problems in modern ladles as illustrated in Fig. 4.31. In those laboratory tests where Al-
killed steels were held in various lining materials, fire clay or zircon-Roseki linings gave rapid Al
loss (and Si pickup) in comparison to significantly less Al loss with high alumina refractory lin-
ings where the lower levels of SiO2 were largely combined as mullite. Refractories with very low
levels of SiO2 (dolomite, magnesia–chrome) obviously perform well in such tests. In actual ser-
vice, the ladle surface is clean only on the first heat, and oxygen pickup is influenced by the
amount and oxidation state of the coating remaining on the lining from the prior heats.
Ladles must also conserve heat by minimizing heat loss during transport and the various process
steps. In this regard, significant developments have been made to properly preheat ladles prior to
the first heat, and to cycle ladles on subsequent heats in a manner to minimize heat losses. Fig. 4.32
shows a ladle cycling procedure for one plant. Fig. 4.33 shows some ladle temperatures for this
plant for the first and subsequent heats. In this case, the first heat was tapped into a ladle preheated
to 1900°F, and later heats were tapped in a cycle of approximately three hours. While every effort
is made to reuse ladles without delay and to provide covers on ladles between heats, processing of
ladles between heats is necessary to remove ladle slag and provide for ladle well cleanout, slide-
gate inspection and repairs and ladle well sanding.
Ladle preheat and cover devices have improved significantly in recent years, and many types of
preheaters (ladle horizontal or vertical) are available, Fig. 4.34. Table 4.9 lists some of the benefits
of proper ladle preheating and cycling, including longer refractory life by minimizing thermal
shock. The actual ability to rapidly cycle ladles and make the most efficient use of preheaters can
vary significantly between operations, depending on shop layout and ladle transfer ability.

Ladle life must be very predictable and reproducible for safety reasons and to avoid process delays.
As a result, ladles are often removed from service to provide an adequate supply of ladles. The cost
of ladle refractories can be significant ($1–4 per ton of steel) and disposal costs of spent linings
must also be considered.

4.5.2 Ladle Design
Steel ladle shells must be constructed to allow safe transport of very heavy loads by transfer cars,
cranes, and other devices. For example, a typical full ladle could involve 200 tons of molten steel
in a lining and steelwork weighing 100 tons. The design of such a structure is highly complex as

Ladles.10 Fig. 4.35 shows the general appearance of some steel ladles indicating the trunnion sup-
ports for ladle lifting and rotation and stiffeners to provide lining structural support. In reality, ladle
structures are often even more complex because of shop specific criteria. For example, Fig. 4.36
shows an obround ladle in which a flat section was added to a round ladle to increase ladle capac-
ity while using existing crane facilities.

In recent years, finite element analysis using non-linear refractory properties and transient tem-
perature regimes are being employed to study the behavior of refractories in steel ladles, Fig. 4.37.
While highly complex, the studies essentially endeavor to maintain the proper degree of compres-
sion on the ladle refractory during all phases of their use in modern ladles. Excessive compressive
forces can result in refractory cracking and/or buckling in areas such as the ladle flat section.
Lower than desirable compressive stresses can cause joints or gaps to form, which may permit
metal or slag penetration.
The properties of refractories may be adjusted to provide proper behavior in ladles. For example,
Fig. 4.38 and Fig. 4.39 show the use of specific refractories to either increase or decrease refrac-
tory expansion to more desirable levels. In Fig. 4.38 a refractory with higher reheat expansion is

used to prevent joint openings in the high alumina section of a ladle. The same ladle might use a
pitch or soft resin brick in the slagline section to reduce expansion and prevent brick cracking or
movement. Ladle finite element analysis has provided valuable guidance for refractory service 
trials to improve behavior.
4.5.3 Ladle Refractory Design and Use
The refractories in steel ladles are zoned in type and thickness to provide maximum service mini-
mum cost. Fig. 4.40 shows a typical ladle to illustrate the overall size and style of a ladle and some
ideas of refractory thickness. Table 4.10 shows ranges of refractory thickness used in ladles.
Linings are relatively thin to meet ladle capacity and weight requirements.

The types of refractory construction vary widely depending on the caster operating conditions and
on the ability to cycle ladles rapidly. Table 4.11 presents some of the more widely used working
lining combinations.
Safety linings function to hold steel or slag for limited time periods, but essentially provide shell
insulation. Multiple component safety linings may be used to further lower shell temperatures as
illustrated in Fig. 4.41. In this illustration, the 4 in. thick safety lining has now changed from all

high-alumina brick to a composite with a high-strength insulation brick to lower the shell temper-
ature. The higher shell temperatures in the slagline are caused primarily by the higher thermal con-
ductivity of the slagline working lining brick. In general, few ladles use true insulating materials
as part of safety linings because of reduced safety lining life and/or increased danger of steel pen-
etration and possible breakouts.
The particular refractory constructions used are under constant change in each operating shop. The
following will comment briefly on the factors and refractory properties important in each area of
the ladle.
4.5.3.1 Stream Impact Pad
As illustrated in Fig. 4.42, wear in this zone occurs as the high-momentum steel stream strikes the
ladle bottom (and in some cases the lower sidewall) during the initial moment of tap. The severity
of this wear is quite shop-specific and requires that additional thickness or quality of refractory be
used. In general, refractories for the stream impact are selected to have maximum erosion resis-
tance based on hot-strength. Fig. 4.43 shows the temperature–hot strength relation for several
refractories used in impact pads where the 96 Al2O3 castable provides improved performance.
4.5.3.2 Bottom and Lower Barrel Refractories
As shown in Fig. 4.44, wear occurs in this area from erosion during stirring or reheating and from
physical damage during deskulling between heats. In some cases, slag remaining in this area in the

time between steel shutoff at the caster and slag dumping can cause slag erosion problems. In gen-
eral, the slag erosion in this area is not sufficient to zone for, except to provide for additional refrac-
tory thickness. Damage from skull removal can occasionally be sufficiently enough severe to
require bottom repairs.
4.5.3.3 Barrel
The barrel normally has the least severe wear in the ladle and can be zoned for quality and/or thick-
ness. Fig. 4.45 shows a ladle in which the barrel castable lining is zoned with a lower quality (lower
Al2O3) castable.
4.5.3.4 Slagline
The most severe wear area of most modern ladles occurs in the ladle slagline where the refractory
is subject to severe corrosion, Fig. 4.46. The slags encountered vary widely, and include high iron
oxide slag carried over from the furnace, artificial slags introduced after partial slag skimming,
slags added or formed during specific metallurgical purposes such as stirring or injection, and
slags formed or circulated during degassing. As the slags are generally basic in nature, basic refrac-
tories are required in ladle slaglines. Fig. 4.47 shows the range of erosion resistance between high-
alumina and various basic refractories. The high-alumina refractories are suitable for most areas of
the ladle other than the slagline proper. Table 4.12 shows the wide range of slag compositions expe-
rienced in one shop producing a wide range of Al-killed caster products.

Barrel
Fig. 4.45 Primary causes of wear in the barrel area of the ladle include: 1. metal erosion with some slag erosion, 2. ther-
mal cycling.

The corrosive effect of ladle slags is particularly severe when arc reheating is used to control and
add steel temperature by superheating the ladle slag. Fig. 4.48 shows the degree of superheat added
to the slag for various slag thicknesses and stirring conditions. As shown, the temperature of the
slag can be expected to be 100–300°F above the steel temperature. Laboratory tests show that slag
erosion rates can increase two to five times for such changes in temperature. Field tests have shown
that slag erosion can be reduced by control of slag basicity, Al2O3 content, and additions of MgO
to the slag as illustrated in Fig. 4.49. Significant control over the amount of erosion during arc
reheating can therefore be obtained using controlled slag obtained using compositions with added

Table 4.13 shows the properties of various MgO–C brick for slaglines and how specific properties
may be improved. Higher purity raw material (sintered or fused MgO and graphite) and metal addi-
tions can be used to enhance the properties of magnesia–carbon brick. Table 4.14 shows some of
the properties of these bricks for ladle slaglines with bricks ranging from 5–15% carbon.

Direct-bonded magnesite–chrome or dolomite refractories may also be used in steel ladle slaglines.
Dolomite refractories provide lower initial cost and excellent performance if ladle cycles can avoid
long delays. Magnesite–chrome refractories can provide lower cost operations if arc reheating con-
ditions are not severe.
It should be noted that thermal cycling damage was listed as a wear mechanism in all areas of the
ladle. The extent of such damage has been greatly minimized in recent years with the proper use
of preheating and more extensive use of ladle covers. Experience in each shop to use the minimum
possible number of ladles at any time and to cycle those ladles as rapidly as possible has also min-
imized the extent of thermal cycle damage.
Ladle flexing on lifting and during other parts of the ladle cycle is known to influence ladle life.
Efforts to combat this effect with improved design in the ladle and lining are continuing.
4.5.4 Ladle Refractory Construction
The majority of ladles in North America are lined with brick construction using semi-universal
shapes as illustrated in Fig. 4.50. This construction allows the use of an upward spiral of brick

against the sloping sides of a ladle. Brick locking is produced by the curved mating surfaces. Other
types of brick construction (arch-wedge or keyed) are more widely used in other parts of the world.
In all cases, tight construction with very thin (or no) mortar joints are necessary to keep the lining
under compression and prevent joint penetration. Certain operations have converted to cast ladles
in the barrel and bottom sections, Fig. 4.40, but efforts to cast basic slaglines have not proven suc-
cessful. Table 4.15 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of cast ladles under present con-
ditions. In general, castables provide an excellent joint-free construction and many offer cost
advantages where a portion of the spent lining can be reused. Castable ladles do require special
equipment, including space, and must be very carefully installed and dried. Future changes in
material and labor costs or environmental changes may require reexamination of castable ladles for
specific shops. At present, ladles are being used where combinations of brick and castable are
employed to obtain the best technical and economic combination of castable and brick approaches
to ladle lining. For example, Fig. 4.51 shows construction in a ladle bottom using a precast impact
pad with the balance of the bottom cast. This construction improves life due to the jointless con-
struction, but avoids most of the special equipment and space requirements required for a fully cast
ladle.
4.5.5 Refractory Stirring Plugs
Refractory stirring cones or plugs are used in ladle bottoms to introduce gas, mainly argon, for
ladle rinsing or stirring in the various metallurgical processes. Fig. 4.52 shows cross sections of
three types of plugs using different directional mechanisms to provide controlled argon flow.
Argon flow may be controlled by the space between a solid refractory cone and its metal casing,
through a permeable refractory cone, or through and solid refractory cone with pre-formed holes
or other channels. The amount of flow required will vary widely from rinsing (low flow) to mix-
ing during arc reheating or other processes. Fig. 4.53 shows the relation between flow and pressure
for several plug types.
The reliable performance and life of plugs is very important in producing consistent steel product
quality. To insure proper flow, it is often necessary to clean the plug surface after a given heat by
oxygen burning or mechanical cleaning. Fig. 4.54 shows the sequence of wear of the plug when a
penetrated plug surface is cleaned to restore flow. The refractories for plugs are high-Al2O3 or
burned MgO materials, designed specifically for this application, and are installed from outside the
ladle by mechanical or manual devices such as the bayonet system shown in Fig. 4.55. This system

permits a quick plug exchange in a hot ladle. Plugs are removed from service after a predetermined
number of minutes of use or when visual wear indicators built into the plug are overused. Because
of wear in the refractory seating block around the plug, hot repairs of the area around the plug may
be required using pneumatic refractory placement or from inside the ladle using a diving bell.
The control of steel flow from ladles to caster molds is accomplished by one of a variety of slid-
ing gate systems. Fig. 4.56 shows the concept of steel flow by a sliding gate, where refractory
plates held under pressure by springs or other devices are moved to control flow. The design and
construction of the various slidegate systems vary widely according to the steel pouring demands
of the particular caster. For example, spring location and method of cooling differ between the var-
ious gate systems and the movement of plates may be accomplished by hydraulic or other mecha-
nisms. All the slidegate systems provide a rapid means of removing pressure from the plates
between heats to allow inspection of the refractories and to permit rapid replacement of plates or
the lower nozzle.
The refractory construction of a typical gate system is illustrated in Fig. 4.57. Included are refrac-
tories in the seating block and upper nozzle in the ladle bottom, the fixed and sliding plates (in this

blocks, respectively, which are selected to balance the overall life of the gate system.

steelplant application. These plates must withstand severe thermal shock and steel erosion for long

the oxide system, Table 4.18, to complex oxide–carbon systems, Table 4.19. The exact plates used
depend largely on the steel compositions to be cast and the frequency of plate replacement. Such
plate replacement can be accompanied after inspection of the plates. Such inspection is performed
after each cast or less frequently based on experience. Fig. 4.58 shows the appearance of plates
after use with either erosion or erosion/cracking requiring the plates to be replaced. Plates may be
changed after only one heat or may have lives of 10 to 20 heats, depending on steel grades and/or
the refractory quality used.

ladle lining and ladle bottom. Coil springs, used to apply face pressure, prevent molten metal leakage without restricting
movement of the lower plate. In a sliding motion, nozzle openings in the upper and lower plates are brought into or out of
alignment to initiate or terminate metal flow. Intermediate positions, with partial alignment of nozzle openings, provide a
throttling action and a range of reduced controlled flow rates.

After each heat, the entire gate system must be cleaned of residual metal and slag by oxygen lanc-
ing and a granular refractory filler installed before the next heat. As illustrated in Fig. 4.59, this
filler (ladle sand) prevents molten metal from entering the gate system before the gate is opened
at the proper time at the caster. The ladle sands may be silica, zircon, or other refractory combi-
nations, Table 4.20, which will flow freely from the slidegate when opened without requiring
mechanical probing or lancing.
4.5.6 Refractory Life and Costs
The life of ladle refractories will obviously vary widely between shops, but historically show sig-
nificant improvement during the first one to three years of operation. These initial improvements
occur from the development of standardized operating conditions and the increased ability to con-
trol ladle cycling. After this initial period, life will improve at a moderate rate from changes in
refractory type and construction. In most cases, slagline life will be less than that for the remain-
ing ladle, with slaglines being replaced one or more times during a ladle campaign. Safety lining

will last multiple working campaigns with some localized repairs. Fig. 4.60 shows the ladle life
history of a caster during the first two years of its operation, where ladle life improved from 50 to
86 heats. This shop used two slaglines per ladle campaign. At present, ladle lives from 50 to 200
heats are being experienced with slagline lives from 30 to 200 heats. For a given shop, analysis of
process data can usually be used to explain differences in the life for a given ladle or a given time
period. For example, one could predict or explain the life of individual ladles by the frequency of
heats with abnormal wear parameters such as long ladle arc times, long steel holding times during
caster delays, and unusual situations where ladles were taken out of service of repairs to slidegates
or plugs.

4.6 Refractories for Degassers
The wear of refractories in degassers can present limitations to equipment availability and cost and
affect steel quality in producing low carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen steel for modern require-
ments. The refractory use and maintenance technologies vary widely with location in a given
degassing unit and between operations.
Fig. 4.61 through Fig. 4.63 illustrate a typical vessel degasser (RH or RH-OB) and refractory con-
struction. Table 4.21 lists refractories used for each area. The RH degasser is a recirculating type
degasser. The snorkels are immersed into a ladle held steel bath. Evacuation of the degasser causes
metal to rise through the legs into the lower vessel. Circulation of the liquid steel results from
injecting argon into the steel in the snorkel of one of the legs (called the lifting leg or up leg) thus
lowering the steel density and causing flow upward. The degassed steel in the lower vessel, now
considerably denser, returns to the ladle through the other leg (appropriately call the return leg or
down leg), descending in fact to the ladle bottom. Steel flow rates, or circulation rates, can be quite
high (e.g., 80,000 kg/min) and depend on argon flow rates and snorkel inside diameter. RH
degasser treatment times generally range between 15 and 30 minutes, the longer times for attain-
ing low hydrogen levels. While originally used primarily for hydrogen removal, alloying, and

inclusion flotation, the RH degasser is now also used for decarburization, nitrogen removal, and
desulfurization.
RH-OB adds oxygen blowing capability to the RH process. With oxygen blowing, heats with
higher furnace tap carbons can be decarburized, and some reheating can be done by aluminum
burning.

Working lining refractories are exposed to a variety of conditions depending on vessel location. All
locations are exposed to thermal and atmospheric cycling. Use of auxiliary heating between treat-
ments can significantly reduce the severity of thermal cycling, but rapid temperature changes can
range from 200 to 600°C depending on the adequacy of that heating. Atmospheric cycling can
range from ambient down as to low as 0.5 Torr. Besides being exposed to liquid steel at tempera-
tures as high as 1650°C, snorkel and lower vessel (particularly throat and bottom) refractories are
subjected to the erosive action of high velocity, turbulent steel flow. Refractories in these locations
are also exposed to contact with slags, which include ladle carryover slags (despite precautions to
exclude them) and those generated during treatment (especially if the treatment includes desulfur-
ization). These refractories may also suffer iron oxide alteration from oxidation of skulls left on
their hot faces and from skull oxide melt runoff from higher vessel locations. Tuyere area refrac-
tories of RH-OB degassers experience greater erosive bath action than do lower vessel sidewall
refractories in RH degassers. Aluminum burning may also cause localized heating. Upper vessel
refractories, spared from erosive bath action, are coated with metal and slag splash accompanying
the violent bath agitation and gas evolution. Subsequent oxidation of the adherent metal results in
major alteration.

Knowledge of the service conditions and nature of the refractory alterations as described above
provide insight into wear mechanisms. In those areas experiencing the greatest steel bath circula-
tion rates, such as snorkel, throat, bottom, and OB tuyere, the likely primary mode of wear is ero-
sion of the disrupted hot face refractory structure. Structural disruption or weakening occurs by a
variety of processes, such as:  thermal shock damage resulting from rapid heating or cooling of the
hot face between preheating and steel processing (the less the difference between the temperatures
involved, the less the damage); Fe21/Fe31 oxide cycling because of oxygen pressure and/or tem-
perature changes (both refractory chrome ore and chromite spinel phases and absorbed iron oxide
zones will be affected); and slag infiltration with dissolution of the normal refractory bonding (sil-
icate bonds are particularly susceptible). Also lost to erosion in these lining areas will be the iron-
oxide-rich immediate hot face portion of the iron oxide absorption zone. Considering the
temperatures involved, wherever the iron oxide content exceeds roughly 80%, appreciable amounts
of liquid are formed. Even in those lining areas subjected to less aggressive contact with the cir-
culating steel (e.g., upper portion of lower vessel sidewall exclusive of OB tuyere areas), the par-
tially liquefied hot face zone will be washed away.
Finally, some wear is likely the result of loss of partial hot face from spalls, as the hot face wear
front approaches internally formed cracks. For a given brick, these losses are probably relatively
discontinuous (as opposed to an essentially continuous erosion–corrosion loss of material). The
loss rate of spalls would be greater in high erosion areas due to more rapid movement of the wear
front and the stripping power of the flowing steel.
RH and RH-OB degasser working linings are commonly direct-bonded magnesia–chromite brick.
To counter the different exposure conditions, linings are often zoned by product quality.
Table 4.22 shows some properties of various types of magnesia–chrome brick. The more corrosion-
resistant products would obviously be selected for the snorkel and lower vessel areas where more
severe conditions are encountered. Similarly, castables for the outside of the snorkel must be
selected for maximum hot-strength and high-temperature stability so that only the most high purity
materials prove successful.

5.1 Industrial Gas Uses
5.1.1 Introduction
The iron and steel industry, one of the largest users of industrial gases, consumes substantial quan-
tities of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen, and a small but growing amount of  carbon diox-
ide (CO2). Table 5.1 shows estimates of total consumption by the US industry for the most
commonly used gases.

Oxygen and nitrogen represent the largest volumes by far. Oxygen consumption has grown sub-
stantially in recent years while use of the other gases has remained relatively constant.
In order to provide a framework for reviewing  the various uses of industrial gases, Table 5.2 sum-
marizes the generic process functions they perform in iron and steelmaking operations.

Oxygen is used to provide process heat through various exothermic reactions which occur upon
contact with hot metal and liquid steel and through combustion of fossil fuels. Injected oxygen
also participates in the formation of carbon monoxide for the reduction of iron ore in the blast fur-
nace and in some natural gas-based processes for producing direct reduced iron. Nitrogen, argon,
and CO2 are used for inerting vessels, equipment, and metal transfer streams in tapping and cast-
ing operations; to eliminate the formation of explosive mixtures in enclosed spaces; and to prevent
undesirable reactions between iron and steel with oxygen and hydrogen in the surrounding atmos-
phere. Nitrogen and argon are also injected into molten iron and steel to provide metal stirring and
slag/metal mixing, and as a carrier gas for powder injection. Additional uses for these gases
include providing conditions which favor the oxidation of carbon instead of chromium in the argon
oxygen decarburization (AOD) process for producing stainless and high alloy steels and as a
coolant to protect oxygen injection tuyeres in various oxygen converters. The choice of gas for
such inerting, stirring, injection, and steelmaking converter operations is dictated by overall cost
and effect on metal chemistry and quality. Nitrogen is usually the gas of choice so long as its reac-
tivity with molten metal and the associated increase in dissolved nitrogen or nitride formation is
acceptable. Argon is used whenever a totally inert gas that does not affect metal chemistry is
required. CO2 does not result in increased nitrogen levels but can result in increased carbon, oxy-
gen, and oxide inclusion content depending on the molten metal chemistry and extent of contact.
A more detailed discussion of the use of each gas follows. 
5.1.2 Oxygen Uses
The introduction of the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) for steelmaking in the 1950s also marked the
genesis for tonnage supply of oxygen from on-site cryogenic air separation plants. Today, oxygen
is the most widely used industrial gas due to its continued use in the BOF and its growing uses for
enrichment in the blast furnace and providing supplemental chemical heat in electric arc furnace
based steelmaking. Over 90% of this oxygen comes from plants that are owned and operated by
industrial gas suppliers. Table 5.3 provides a summary of the more significant oxygen uses for the
integrated and electric arc furnace industry segments.

5.1.2.1 Blast Furnace
The use of significant quantities of oxygen for enrichment of the blast has become widespread. Table
5.3 shows that specific consumption rates have more than doubled over the last five years, and 40%
of the total oxygen requirement of integrated steel mills is consumed in the blast furnace. This
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

increase is a result of the desire for higher furnace productivity and the growth in powdered coal and
natural gas injection as a means of reducing coke consumption and lowering production costs. Typical
levels of enrichment are in the range of 3–8%, but enrichment levels as high as 12% have been used
in furnaces using large amounts of coal or natural gas. Oxygen enrichment increases furnace pro-
ductivity by reducing the blast volume and the associated pressure drop which allows a higher total
oxygen throughput rate. It is also used to compensate for the reduction in raceway adiabatic flame
temperature (RAFT) that results from the injection of powdered coal and natural gas into blast fur-
nace tuyeres, thereby maintaining smooth furnace operation and the required hot metal temperature.
Oxygen is injected through spargers into the cold blast line between the blower and stoves. While
process considerations would allow the use of relatively low purity oxygen for enrichment, the
need to supply high purity oxygen for the BOF and to produce nitrogen and argon usually results
in the use of standard 99.5% purity plants. However, the trend to very high rates of powdered coal
and natural gas injection can easily result in the use of 300 to 1000 tons of oxygen per day in a sin-
gle furnace. There have been a few recent installations of on-site cryogenic plants that are dedi-
cated to the blast furnace thereby allowing optimization concerning product purity as well as plant
integration and cogeneration schemes. The pressure required depends on the operating pressure of
the blast furnaces and is usually about 60 psig.
5.1.2.2 Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF)
Oxygen is used primarily for decarburization and conversion of blast furnace hot metal to liquid
steel in the BOF. This accounts for 55% of the total oxygen consumption in integrated steel mills.
The heat which results from the exothermic reactions of oxygen with silicon and carbon in the hot
metal and the post combustion of a portion (about 10–15%) of the carbon monoxide (CO) which
is generated in the converter is sufficient to melt scrap in quantities that amount to about 25% of
the total vessel charge weight. A supply system capable of providing high flow rates of up to 30,000
scfm at nominal pressures of around 250 psig for about 20 minutes is required. High purity (99.5%
oxygen content) is required to achieve required low steel nitrogen contents and to maximize ves-
sel productivity and scrap melting capability. In most vessels, all of the oxygen is injected through
a water cooled top lance with tips that have four or five nozzles which generate supersonic jets that
impinge on the molten bath surface. Recently, lances which also have a number of secondary sub-
sonic oxygen nozzles have been introduced to increase the degree of CO post combustion in order
to control skull formation and increase scrap melting capability. There are also several modifica-
tions to the BOF such as the K-BOP and OBM for which some or nearly all of the required oxy-
gen is injected through hydrocarbon shrouded tuyeres located in the bottom of the converter.
5.1.2.3 Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)
Table 5.3 also shows that the total consumption of oxygen in electric arc furnaces has also more
than doubled in the last five years, and that much of this increase is due to a 75% increase in spe-
cific oxygen consumption during this time period. Typical uses for oxygen in the EAF include oxy-
fuel burners for scrap heating and melting; high velocity lancing for localized scrap melting, steel
decarburization, slag foaming; and sub-sonic injection for post combustion of carbon monoxide.
Recent trends to use more supplemental chemical energy to increase furnace productivity and
reduce melting time and electric power consumption, scrap pre-heating, and the growing use of
high carbon content materials such as direct reduced iron (DRI), pig iron, iron carbide, and hot
metal have all contributed to this significant increase in specific oxygen consumption over the past
five years. Oxygen derived chemical energy can provide 30% or more of the total energy required
to make steel in a modern high productivity EAF.
The equipment used to deliver the oxygen includes water cooled burners located on furnace walls,
slag doors, and pre-heat shafts to provide direct flame impingement on cold scrap; water cooled or
consumable lances which are positioned through the slag door or sidewall for scrap cutting, bath
decarburization, and slag foaming; and door and sidewall lances or wall mounted nozzles  for post
combustion.

Growth in the rate of steel production and in specific oxygen consumption at many EAF based
mills have combined to increase oxygen use to levels that make an on-site plant an increasingly
typical mode of supply. Cryogenic, vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA), and pressure swing
adsorption (PSA) type plants are all used depending on the total industrial gas requirement of the
plant and surrounding local market, purity requirement, use pattern, power rate, etc. Oxygen purity
is usually in the range of 90–99.5%, and supply pressure is usually in the range of 150–250 psig.
5.1.2.4 Cutting and Burning
High purity (above 98%) oxygen is also used extensively throughout integrated and EAF based
mills for steel cutting and burning as well as general lancing requirements. Significant uses in this
category include automatic cut-off torches on continuous casters, periodic lancing to remove skulls
from the mouths of vessels and ladles, and cutting of crops, skulls, and other forms of mill scrap
into pieces that can be readily fed to the BOF or EAF.
5.1.2.5 Steel Reheating
Oxygen is also sometimes used for enrichment or with oxy-fuel burners in steel reheat furnaces.
Benefits associated with the use of oxy-fuel burners include a 25–60% reduction in fuel con-
sumption and associated sulfur dioxide (SO2) and CO2 emissions, increased furnace productivity,
up to 90% reduction in nitrous oxide (NOx ) emissions, and elimination of recuperators.
5.1.3 Nitrogen Uses
Table 5.4 identifies the common uses for nitrogen in both integrated and EAF plants.

which is an average consumption of 122 scf/ton.
As noted, both overall consumption and intensity of use are considerably higher at integrated plants.
Nitrogen purity for most applications is typically 99.999%. Occasionally, nitrogen with a nominal
purity of around 97–99% may be used for inerting to prevent explosive mixtures in confined spaces.
High purity nitrogen containing 5–10% hydrogen is used to provide a protective reducing atmos-
phere in batch and continuous type bright annealing furnaces for carbon steel grades.
5.1.3.1 Integrated Plants
Traditional uses of nitrogen in integrated plants include purging and inerting of blast furnace raw
material charging equipment to prevent reactions of air with furnace offgas; injecting lime, lime-
magnesium mixtures, or other reagents in powder form through refractory coated lances to desul-
furize hot metal in torpedo cars and ladles; injection through bottom tuyeres to provide stirring and
slag/metal mixing during the initial period of refining in the BOF which improves yield, reduces
slag iron oxide (FeO) content, and lowers metal oxygen content; as the inert component with

5–15% hydrogen for bright annealing in continuous or batch furnaces; and as a clean and dry gas
for various types of pneumatic instrumentation and process control equipment.
The adoption of powdered coal injection (PCI) in blast furnaces usually creates a new requirement
for nitrogen to inert and prevent explosions in coal grinding, storage, and handling equipment. A
process called slag splashing, which uses high pressure and flows of nitrogen through the top lance
to coat the inside of BOF vessels and extend its refractory life, has also been recently adopted by
most plants in North America. Finally, nitrogen can be used instead of air in the pneumatic knives
used to control coating thickness in hot dip galvanizing lines. The benefits of nitrogen wiping
include less dross formation, improved coating thickness control, and fewer coating defects such
as edge build-up or entrapped oxides.
5.1.3.2 EAF Plants
Traditional uses for nitrogen in EAF plants include injection through top lances or porous plugs in
ladles to provide stirring for steel temperature and composition control and to remove oxide inclu-
sions; injecting powdered reagents containing one or more constituents such as calcium, silicon,
and aluminum to desulfurize steel in ladles and ladle furnaces; preventing reaction with surround-
ing air of open teem streams between the tundish and molds in continuous casters; and as a clean
and dry gas for pneumatic instrumentation and process control equipment.
Uses that are more site specific include injection through multi-hole elements to provide stirring
in the EAF for faster melting, power savings, and improved temperature and composition control;
injection through porous elements of various designs to modify flow patterns and remove inclu-
sions in tundishes; to protect the tuyeres and promote carbon removal with minimum oxidation of
chromium in the AOD process for producing stainless and other high alloy grades; and as the inert
component with hydrogen for bright annealing in continuous or batch furnaces.
5.1.4 Argon Uses
Table 5.5 identifies the common uses for argon in both integrated and EAF plants. Argon purity is
typically 99.998%, and it is usually supplied from liquid storage tanks at pressures up to 200 psig.

stirring and slag/metal mixing during the final stages of refining in the BOF which improves yield,
reduces slag FeO content, and lowers metal oxygen content; injection through porous plugs to pro-
vide stirring for improved temperature and chemistry control and to promote desulfurization in
ladles and ladle furnaces; injection of various powdered reagents in ladles and ladle furnaces for
desulfurization; injection in vacuum degassers to facilitate carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen removal
and to provide circulating metal flow in RH type degassers; and inerting submerged entry nozzles

tundish to mold transfers in continuous casters. Recently, argon has also been used to inert the
tundish headspace during transient periods of operation to improve slab surface quality.
5.1.4.2 EAF Plants
Argon is primarily used in plants that produce stainless and high alloy grades, flat carbon steel prod-
ucts, and high quality long products. Traditional uses include many of those described above for the
integrated plants such as ladle, ladle furnace, and vacuum degasser stirring, powder injection, and
inerting of submerged entry nozzles and tundishes in continuous casters. In addition, argon is also
used extensively to facilitate carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen removal in the AOD process for pro-
ducing a wide variety of stainless, tool, heat resisting, and other high alloy content grades.
5.1.5 Hydrogen Uses
Hydrogen is used in significant quantities for natural gas based production of direct reduced iron
(DRI). In the Midrex process, the CO2 and H2O which is present in the offgas from the direct
reduction shaft reactor is used to reform natural gas and produce the high temperature H2 and CO
containing reducing gas required to achieve the desired level of  iron ore conversion to iron. In
Hylsa's HYL III process, a conventional steam reformer is used to produce the reducing gas, and
the CO2 and H2O in the reactor offgas is removed to allow recycle of unreacted H2 and CO back
into the reactor. The natural gas consumption is approximately 11,000 scf per ton of DRI, and the
reducing gas generators are part of the overall plant installation.
The other common use for hydrogen is for annealing atmospheres. For carbon steel annealing,
atmosphere compositions of 5–10% hydrogen with the balance nitrogen are commonly used in
both continuous and batch furnace types. For stainless and other high alloy products, the hydrogen
content is typically in the range of 75–100%. Typical hydrogen purity is 99.995%. These atmos-
pheres serve to transfer heat, remove residual rolling oils, prevent surface oxidation, and reduce
any surface oxides that may be present resulting in a bright annealed surface free from oxides,
deposits, and discoloration.
A recent trend is to anneal coils in batch bell-type furnaces that have been designed to use a 100%
hydrogen atmosphere. The main benefit is a shorter cycle time and increased productivity due to
the higher diffusivity and thermal conductivity of pure hydrogen and improved uniformity of
mechanical properties as a result of more uniform temperature distribution throughout the coil.
5.1.6 Carbon Dioxide Uses
CO2 is sometimes used as a stirring gas in BOF vessels in place of nitrogen and argon. This option
provides the ability to achieve lower steel nitrogen contents and lowers stirring gas costs by reduc-
ing or eliminating the use of argon which is more expensive per unit volume. However, since CO2
is a reactive gas when exposed to molten steel under the conditions associated with submerged injec-
tion, increased wear of the bottom injection tuyeres and surrounding refractory materials and an
inability to achieve low aim carbon contents may result. CO2 is occasionally used for ladle stirring.
As for BOF stirring, it offers a combination of lower nitrogen content and lower gas cost versus the
alternatives of nitrogen or argon. However, the same potential for increased porous plug and refrac-
tory wear exists, and there is also the risk of higher oxide inclusion contents due to the reaction of
the CO2 with deoxidants such as silicon or aluminum. CO2 has also been used in continuous billet
casters for protecting the tundish to mold stream from contact with the surrounding atmosphere.
A more recent application for CO2 is to suppress fugitive fume emissions during electric arc fur-
nace charging and tapping operations and to lower nitrogen pick-up during  EAF or BOF tapping
operations. Typical practice is to inject CO2 in snow form to eliminate air from the furnace during
charging and from around the tap stream and its impact zone in the ladle. Industry experience with
this type of CO2 application is extremely limited, and more work needs to be done to optimize prac-
tices and quantify potential benefits.

5.2 Industrial Gas Production
5.2.1 Introduction
The industrial gases that are used in the steel industry are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and
argon) or gases that are produced from hydrocarbon processing either directly or as byproducts
(hydrogen and carbon dioxide.) Hydrogen is also obtained as a byproduct from a number of
processes including the cracking of ethane to produce ethylene and the electrochemical process
used to produce chlorine (the chlor-alkali process). The atmospheric gases are separated from air
using cryogenic processes for large quantity5, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum swing
adsorption (VSA), or vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) for moderate quantities of oxy-
gen, or membranes when a moderate quantity of nitrogen is the only product desired. Hydrogen is
typically produced from natural gas using steam reforming or separated as byproduct streams from
hydrocarbon containing streams. The carbon dioxide that is supplied to industrial users is most
often obtained as a byproduct from ammonia and hydrogen plants using an acid gas (CO2, hydro-
gen sulfide H2S, etc.) removal system. CO2 can also be economically recovered from fermentation
systems, natural gas wells, and, in some cases, from combustion systems.
Industrial gases are supplied from on-site plants that are dedicated to the needs of one steel mill,
from industrial gases complexes by pipelines that serve multiple steel mills and/or other users, or as
cryogenic liquid products that are trucked in from a production facility that can supply hundreds of
small volume users. For atmospheric gases the process used to produce the gas will depend on which
gases are needed and the quantity and quality requirements. Fig. 5.1 shows the approximate flow
and purity boundaries that define the low cost supply options for oxygen. Similarly, Fig. 5.2 shows
the flow/purity regions where the alternative nitrogen production processes are most economical.
Argon is almost always obtained from cryogenic air separation units and supplied as a liquid.

The hydrogen supplied by tube trailer or as liquid is normally produced from steam reforming of
methane or obtained as a byproduct, most often from chlorine production. The tradeoff between
tube trailer and liquid is also affected by the location of the user relative to the production site. Tube
trailer supply is favored when the distances are short (<200 miles). Modular on-site reformers are
relatively new to the supply picture and are filling a void between the liquid and the custom
designed reformer option.
Except for rare cases where the user is near a high quality source of CO2, carbon dioxide is sup-
plied as a liquid.
5.2.2 Atmospheric Gases Produced by Cryogenic Processes
Cryogenic air separation plants can be designed to produce oxygen, nitrogen, argon, or any com-
bination of the three. Since oxygen typically is the dominant product for steel industry applications,
this discussion will focus on it with nitrogen and argon treated as optional products that can be
made available with system modifications.
The commercial production of oxygen in cryogenic plants is well established with hundreds of
plants operating worldwide and individual capacities ranging from 20 to over 3000 tons per day.
Present-day processes are basically the same as those used in the early 1900s. Although plant

capacities and efficiencies have increased dramatically and many equipment variations have been
developed, the principle of distilling air to separate the oxygen from the nitrogen remains the heart
of the process. This distillation technology is like that used in the petroleum and chemical indus-
tries except that air distillation requires operation at cryogenic temperatures instead of the higher
temperatures used in most other applications. The four main process steps and sequence necessary
to produce gaseous oxygen from air are shown in Fig. 5.3. These steps are supported by subsys-
tems such as expansion turbines to provide refrigeration, and superheaters to recover refrigeration.
The composition of air and the characteristics of all of its constituents must be addressed in design-
ing cryogenic separation systems. Components considered as contaminants in air separation
include carbon dioxide, water, and hydrocarbons in various concentrations. The four process steps
and supporting subsystems are designed to effectively remove the contaminants and separate the
air into its various products.
5.2.2.1 Air Compression
Air compression, the simplest step, uses standard commercial equipment. As atmospheric air,
drawn through a filter, is compressed to a pressure of about 90 psia, the heat of compression is
removed by coolers and entrained water is removed by water separators. The compressed air sup-
plied to the air separation unit contains the energy required to separate the air into oxygen and
nitrogen. Power is the primary operating cost element in the production of oxygen. Since most of
the power is used for compression, design of the entire air separation process must be keyed to
obtaining maximum efficiency in the compression step.
5.2.2.2 Contaminant Removal and Heat Exchange
The air stream that leaves the compressor aftercooler at near-ambient temperature contains carbon
dioxide, water vapor, and hydrocarbons. These contaminants must be removed, and the stream must
be cooled to the liquefaction temperature before the distillation process can be started. Carbon
dioxide and water freeze before the air liquefaction temperature (-278°F at 90 psia) is reached;
therefore, the removal of these contaminants is critical to prevent heat exchanger plugging.
The primary method for performing contaminant removal is the pre-purifier system. Pre-purifiers
use adsorbents such as molecular sieves to remove bulk and trace contaminants at ambient tem-
peratures. The filtered air from the compression system normally is cooled to about 40°F using a
refrigerant chiller to condense and remove water vapor so that smaller adsorption beds can be used.
Typically, there are two beds with one on-stream while the other is being regenerated. They are

sized to reduce the water content to 0.1 ppm and the carbon dioxide content to 0.25 ppm. These
beds also reduce hydrocarbon concentrations to acceptable levels. The clean, dry process air from
the pre-purifier is then cooled to the liquefaction temperature through heat exchange with the cold
product and waste streams. This is accomplished in a primary heat exchanger (PHX) that is of
plate-and-fin construction.
5.2.2.3 Cryogenic Distillation
The distillation process is used for separating air into its desired components of oxygen, nitrogen,
etc. If the maximum amount of oxygen is recovered from the feed air stream, the feed air quantity
required to produce a given amount of oxygen is minimized. Thus, the energy required for air com-
pression (the power required for the process) is also minimized.
The distillation process is based on allowing vapor to rise through a descending flow of liquids.
When a liquid mixture of two components with different boiling points is thoroughly mixed with
vapors of a similar composition, the liquids and vapors reform. After the first contact, the vapor
contains more of the component with the lower boiling point (nitrogen), and the liquid contains
more of the component with the higher boiling point (oxygen). Thus, after one contact stage, the
two components are partially separated with the vapor enriched with one component and the liq-
uid enriched with the other. The separation becomes more complete—higher component purities
are obtained—if successive vapor-liquid contacting stages are provided.
The distillation column provides many contact stages in a single vessel. Traditionally, each contact
stage consisted of a single tray—a perforated plate that promotes intimate mixing of the liquids and
vapors. The descending liquid spreads across the plate and contacts the vapor rising through the
perforations. Part of the vapor condenses and joins the liquid which becomes progressively richer
in oxygen, and some of the liquid boils off and joins the vapor which becomes progressively richer
in nitrogen. Part of the fluid at the bottom of the column is withdrawn as product oxygen and the
rest is heated in a reboiler to form the vapor that rises through the column. Similarly, at the top of
the column, part of the fluid is withdrawn as waste-nitrogen vapor and the rest is cooled in a con-
denser to form the liquid that descends through the column. The components of the air are used to
heat the reboiler and cool the condenser. Over the past few years packing has been used instead of
trays for many air separation applications. In either case, column operation is essentially the same.
The double-column concept has been used by the air separation industry for most of this century.
It enables oxygen recovery of over 95%. The key is the relationship of the boiling points of oxy-
gen and nitrogen at different pressures. The boiling points become higher as the pressure increases.
The boiling temperature of nitrogen at 90 psia is higher than the boiling temperature of oxygen at
22 psia. Under these conditions, nitrogen can be condensed by transferring heat to the boiling oxy-
gen. The boiling of oxygen by condensing nitrogen in the double column provides the driving force
for this distillation process. The double column has a combination reboiler/condenser unit (main
condenser) located between the two sections of the column. Each column operates at a different
pressure to exploit the boiling point variations at different pressures. By condensing nitrogen to
provide reflux liquid for both the upper and lower columns, the main condenser provides vapor
boil-up (gaseous oxygen) to the upper column. The lower column provides a crude product split
and the upper column provides a finer separation.
The air stream that feeds the distillation column is primarily in the gaseous state. Refrigeration
must be provided to cool a portion of the stream to temperatures low enough to form the liquid nec-
essary for the distillation process. Modern plants use an expansion turbine to produce the low  tem-
peratures;  the compressed air feed is expanded through a turbine and energy is recovered
externally. These turbo-expanders recover energy and produce refrigeration efficiently. 
5.2.2.4 Oxygen Compression
The fourth process step, oxygen compression, boosts the pressure of the product oxygen leaving
the air separation unit  from near-atmospheric to the desired end-use pressure. Most oxygen users

in the steel industry require pressures of 250 psig or higher. Compression of large quantities of
oxygen has traditionally been accomplished by specially designed centrifugal machines that are
commercially available from several suppliers. 
5.2.2.5 Cryogenic Process Description 
The four major process steps of a double-column air separation system integrated into a typical
process arrangement for producing gaseous oxygen are shown in Fig. 5.4.

The feed air is drawn in through an inlet air filter, compressed to the head pressure of the plant,
and then cooled in the aftercooler. Condensed moisture is removed in the moisture separator which
also serves to smooth the flow of air to the air separation unit.
The air then passes through the switching valves into the prepurifier where the contaminants are
removed. The clean air stream leaving the prepurifier is fed to the brazed aluminum heat
exchanger (primary heat exchanger, PHX). The vast majority of the air (normally greater than
90%) is cooled to near its liquefaction temperature by the returning product and waste streams and
flows from the PHX to the bottom of the lower column. The remaining air is removed from the
primary heat exchanger at about the midpoint and fed to the air-expansion turbine which supplies
the refrigeration for the process. As the vapor rises through the lower column, essentially pure
nitrogen is formed. This vapor is liquefied in the main condenser and split into two streams, lower
column reflux and upper column reflux. The upper column reflux is cooled against waste nitrogen
gas in the nitrogen superheater. The bottoms product of the lower column, a liquid rich in oxygen,
is also cooled in the nitrogen superheater before being fed to the middle of the upper column.
The bottoms product of the upper column is pure oxygen. Although a small fraction of this oxygen
can be withdrawn as a liquid, the bulk of it is reboiled in the main condenser to form both the vapor
that rises in the upper column and the gaseous oxygen product. The product oxygen is warmed by

a heat exchange with feed air in the oxygen superheater, and then further heated to ambient tem-
perature as it flows through the primary heat exchanger. This product oxygen leaves the air separa-
tion unit at a pressure of about 2 psig and is compressed to the desired end-use pressure.
The overhead vapor of the upper column, the waste nitrogen stream, has the lowest temperature of
any stream in the plant. The low temperature refrigeration available from this stream is recovered
in the nitrogen superheater that cools the feed streams to the columns. The nitrogen is warmed to
ambient temperature through heat exchange with the air stream in the primary heat exchanger
before being vented to the atmosphere. 
5.2.2.6 Product Options
The basic plant configuration presented in Fig. 5.4 is very versatile and can be used to provide
many product variations. The product options of interest for steelmaking include gaseous oxygen,
gaseous nitrogen, and argon.
5.2.2.6.1 Gaseous Oxygen
Gaseous oxygen can be produced in purities varying from enriched air,
slightly greater than 21 mol% O2, to beyond standard high purity (99.5 mol%). A basic plant
designed for 95 mol% purity will produce oxygen at a lower cost than a system designed for 99.5
mol% oxygen. The lower purity requires a less complete separation and, consequently, fewer trays
in the upper column. Since the pressure drop caused by the trays in the upper column has a signif-
icant impact on the required compressor discharge pressure, low purity plants consume less power.
5.2.2.6.2 Gaseous Nitrogen
Low purity nitrogen (~99 mol% N2) can be obtained from the top of
either the upper or lower column. Small quantities of high-purity nitrogen (99.999 mol% N2) can
be produced by increasing the number of trays in the lower column and drawing off nitrogen gas
from the top of this high-pressure unit. This method of high purity nitrogen recovery has only a
limited effect on the overall power requirement for oxygen production.
If substantial quantities of high purity nitrogen are required, provisions must be integrated into the
original process and equipment design for the plant. Basically, this involves adding a "top hat" sec-
tion on the upper column to provide the necessary separation and purification capacity. The top hat
section provides additional trays which increase the pressure drop and add to the power for the air
separation system. The ratio of high purity nitrogen to oxygen product can be as high as 3:1.
5.2.2.6.3 Argon
All oxygen or oxygen-nitrogen plants can be designed to accommodate the add-on
side column and the refinery required for argon recovery and purification. With the inclusion of
the proper number of contacting surfaces in the upper and lower columns and provision for suffi-
cient refrigeration, a relatively high percentage of the argon available in the feed air can be pro-
duced. The add-on system shown in Fig. 5.4 recovers, refines, and stores liquid argon. Argon
production can range between 3–4% of the oxygen product rate.
5.2.3 Atmospheric Gases Produced by PSA/VSA/VPSA/Membranes
Cryogenic technology has been the dominant supply option for the steel industry since oxygen was
first used in steel production. The development of separation systems that operate at near atmos-
pheric temperatures and pressures have begun to supply oxygen to smaller volume users such as
mini-mills (VPSA Systems). Membranes have not proven to be a cost effective method for oxygen
production but can competitively produce nitrogen depending on the quantity and quality required.
5.2.3.1 PSA/VSA/VPSA Systems
Pressure swing adsorption for oxygen production involves the use of synthetic zeolites (molecular
sieves) to adsorb nitrogen from a pressurized air stream in a fixed bed system. During the adsorp-
tion portion of the cycle 90–93% purity oxygen is produced while the adsorbent becomes saturated
with nitrogen. When nearly all the adsorbent is at the nitrogen saturation point, the bed is removed
from production service and is regenerated. Regeneration is mainly accomplished by lowering the
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

pressure of the bed which allows most of the nitrogen to be desorbed and released from the bed
followed by purging the low pressure bed with a small portion of the product oxygen. After the bed
has been regenerated, it is repressurized and placed back into service. The total cycle time (the time
associated with the adsorption period through regeneration to the point in time when the bed is
again making product) ranges from 1–3 minutes. PSA systems operate at feed pressures ranging
from 40–80 psia and regeneration pressures near atmospheric. VSA systems use a feed pressure of
one atmosphere and regeneration at 3–5 psia. VPSA systems operate with feed pressures  in the
20–30 psia region with regeneration occurring at 3–10 psia. The vacuum regeneration allows for
greater effective nitrogen adsorption capacity for a specific molecular sieve. VPSA systems have
become the technology of choice because of their lower capital and operating costs.
5.2.3.1.1 Process Description
The number of adsorption beds used in PSA/VSA/VPSA systems have
ranged from one to four depending on the choice of molecular sieve and the approach to regener-
ation. Fig. 5.5 shows a schematic of a two bed VPSA system.

The system consists of an inlet air filter, an air blower, a feed discharge silencer, an aftercooler,
switching valves, two adsorption beds, a vacuum blower, a vacuum separator/silencer, product
surge tanks, an oxygen compressor, and high pressure receivers.
Air is compressed to 20–30 psia by the feed blower and cooled to near ambient temperature in the
aftercooler. The air then passes through switching valves to one of the two adsorption beds, Bed
A, where water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen are adsorbed. Oxygen product
at 90–93% purity leaves the adsorption bed through a second series of switching valves and is fed
to the product compressor. The oxygen surge tank is used to dampen pressure fluctuations at the
product compressor inlet that result from the switching of the adsorption beds. The product com-
pressor delivers oxygen at the desired pressure for use in the electric arc furnace. The high pres-
sure receiver is used to accommodate the flow fluctuations that result from the intermittent use
patterns of most EAFs.

After the sorbent in Bed A has been nearly saturated with nitrogen the feed air is switched to Bed
B which had been previously regenerated. Bed A undergoes regeneration by being pumped to 5–10
psia using the vacuum blower. The nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and water vapor des-
orb from the sieve and are evacuated from the bed. At the end of the evacuation period a small
quantity of product oxygen is used to purge the remaining desorbed material from the void spaces
around the adsorbent particles prior to repressurizing the bed for use in the adsorption step.
5.2.3.1.2 Product Options
PSA/VPSA systems that use synthetic zeolites as the sieve have generally
been successful for the production of oxygen. The waste nitrogen from the process can contain as
much as 10% oxygen as well as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and small quantities of hydrocarbons.
PSA systems based on carbon molecular sieves are used to produce nitrogen (97–99.5%) in mod-
erate quantities. The waste oxygen product from nitrogen PSAs has too much nitrogen to be of use
in steel applications.
5.2.3.2 Membranes
Membranes for atmospheric gases are used exclusively for the production of nitrogen. Hollow fiber
polymeric membranes use differences in permeation rates to separate nitrogen from air. Generally
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor permeate faster than nitrogen so nitrogen at purities up to
about 99.9% can be economically obtained at flow rates up to 10,000 scfh. The two essential char-
acteristics of a membrane are its permeability and selectivity. Permeability defines the rate at which
constituents (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) will pass through a membrane for a given pressure drop while
selectivity defines the rate that one component will flow through the membrane relative to the rate
of a second component. For membranes used for nitrogen production, selectivity is the ratio of oxy-
gen permeability to nitrogen permeability. The most cost effective membrane systems would have
high permeability and high selectivity. However, membranes with high permeability usually have
low selectivity and membranes that are highly selective normally have low permeability.
5.2.3.2.1 Process Description
As shown in Fig. 5.6 membrane systems are relatively simple consist-
ing of an air compressor, a membrane unit which contains bundles of hollow fiber membranes, and
a control unit.

The air compressor is used to pressurize the air to 100–150 psig. The air is then cooled and com-
pressor oil and water are removed. The air enters the membrane unit which is composed of bun-
dles containing more than a million membrane fibers. Each fiber is thinner than a human hair. The
hollow fiber membranes are arranged in the bundles so that the unit's flow configuration is simi-
lar to that of a shell and tube heat exchanger. Bundles normally contain a fixed number of fibers
having a fairly constant surface area. The number of bundles used is proportional to the desired
product rate from the unit. The bundles all operate in parallel if low purity nitrogen (97%) is
acceptable. If higher purities are required, then a second set or even a third set of bundles can be
operated in series with the first set.

5.2.4 Hydrogen Production
Hydrogen production is dominated by the steam reforming of methane. Fig. 5.7 presents the basic
schematic for a steam reformer system used to produce hydrogen. In a typical steam reformer the
natural gas provides both feedstock and fuel. The feedstock portion is compressed to about 400
psia, preheated to about 750°F, and desulfurized in a zinc oxide bed. The sulfur free natural gas is
mixed with steam at approximately a 3:1 steam to carbon ratio and further heated to about 925°F
prior to entering the reformer. The reformer reactions proceed to near equilibrium in catalyst filled
tubes that are heated from the outside by the combustion of natural gas and/or PSA tail gas. The
reformed gas leaves the furnace at about 1450°F and is cooled slightly prior to entering the high
temperature shift reactor (HTS). The feed gas entering the HTS has a hydrogen to carbon ratio of
about 5:1. The catalyst in the HTS increases this ratio to more than 30:1. The hydrogen rich gas
leaving the HTS unit is cooled to near ambient temperature and fed to a Pressure Swing Adsorption
(PSA) unit. Between 80–90% of the hydrogen is recovered as product with purities of 99.999%.
The unconverted CO and the unrecovered hydrogen (PSA Tail Gas) is used to fuel the reformer.

Most hydrogen needs in the steel industry are relatively small, less than 1 million scfd.
Consequently, hydrogen is often supplied as liquid because the usage rate is too low to justify an
on-site plant. Recently, modular reformer systems have been developed that are cost effective at
flow rates as low as 150,000 scfd.
Hydrogen has also been recovered from coke oven gas which contains 40–50% hydrogen. This has
been accomplished by using a PSA to adsorb all of the coke oven gas constituents except hydro-
gen.  For this system to be effective the coke oven gas has to be compressed and nearly all of the
heavy hydrocarbons have to be removed to prevent PSA fouling. This approach has been used
when other sources of hydrogen have not been readily available.
5.2.5 Carbon Dioxide Production
Except for some carbon dioxide that is recovered from gas wells, most sources of carbon dioxide
are dilute streams, less than about 30% CO2, at low pressure that are very expensive to recover.
Most of the carbon dioxide that is recovered for commercial use is a byproduct of another process

such as ammonia production. CO2 removal is a requirement to make the chemical synthesis process
economical and is paid for by the chemical manufacturer. Ammonia plants use either chemical
absorbents (amines or hot potassium carbonate) or physical absorbents (methanol or Selexol sol-
vent) to remove carbon dioxide from the process stream. The vent gas from these absorbent systems
contains more than 90% CO2 by volume. Normally only a portion of the CO2 produced by these
plants is converted into liquid CO2 because more is produced than can be sold within a reasonable
distribution area. Fig. 5.8 shows a common CO2 liquefaction process.

A CO2 rich stream that has been purified to remove water and other impurities is compressed to

tillation column. The remainder of the refrigeration is obtained from an ammonia refrigeration loop.
The distillation column provides the final purification and delivers a product that is 99.99% CO2.
5.3 Industrial Gas Supply System Options and Considerations
5.3.1 Introduction
The choice of supply system to provide industrial gases to the steel industry depends upon several
variables. The decision to supply gases by either pipeline, on-site plant or merchant liquid is deter-
mined by the number of gases required, the purity of the gases, the volume of gas, the use pressure,
the use pattern, the cost of power, backup requirements and integration with other utilities.
5.3.2 Number of Gases
If oxygen, nitrogen and argon are required and the volume requirement is modest, the supply can
be merchant (liquid) product delivered into tanks at the mill. If the volume of gases is large (more
than 100,000 cfh oxygen) the supply will most likely be a cryogenic on-site plant. Finally, if the
requirement is large for oxygen, but small for argon or nitrogen,  the supply can be a combination
of VPSA/VSA/PSA for oxygen and merchant for argon and nitrogen.

5.3.3 Purity of Gases
If high purity is not required for oxygen or nitrogen, the supply mode can be non-cryogenic on-site
(VPSA/VSA/PSA or membrane) if the required volume is in the range of about 10,000 to 120,000 stan-
dard cubic feet per hour. These non-cryogenic supply systems deliver product purity between 90–99%.
Because of  separation process requirements, argon is always delivered as high purity product.
5.3.4 Volume of Gases
The amount of gas required will determine supply mode and plant size. Small users, merchant;
larger users, VPSA/VSA/PSA; largest users, on-site cryogenic plants. See Fig. 5.1 and Fig. 5.2.
5.3.5 Use Pressure
The pressure requirement of the gas at the use point is no longer a variable that determines supply
mode. However, it does determine requirements for compression equipment and high pressure gas
storage receivers. In the case of merchant supply, high pressure tanks are used to supply high pres-
sure product to the use point.
5.3.6 Use Pattern
The use pattern of the gases will determine the number of high pressure storage receivers required
to deliver the gas when and in the volumes that are needed.
5.3.7 Cost of Power
Merchant supply requires no power to vaporize or compress the gas to use pressure. On-site sup-
ply modes require power to separate and compress the gases. The on-site supply modes have dif-
ferent power requirements that are dependent upon the volume and pressure requirements.
5.3.8 Backup Requirements
On-site supply systems are usually backed up with some quantity of merchant product. This quan-
tity is determined by the process requirements of the steel mill and cost.
5.3.9 Integration
Because on-site supply systems are a steady draw on the power grid, they are good customers for
the electrical company. As a major user of electrical power, the on-site supply plant should be
included in an overall energy/utility strategy for the steel mill.
5.4 Industrial Gas Safety
Table 5.7 shows the boiling points and densities of the industrial gases commonly used for steel-
making. These physical properties as well as chemical reactivity are among the most important
attributes that determine the potential for risk and safe handling practices for these gases.

5.4.1 Oxygen
At ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas.
For all ironmaking and steelmaking applications, oxygen is used in its gaseous form.
Approximately 21% of the air we breathe is oxygen.
5.4.1.1 Chemical Properties
Ironmaking and steelmaking are processes of controlled reduction and oxidation. Oxygen in iron-
making is used to reduce iron ore by reacting with coke to form CO and to create heat by taking
advantage of the chemical reaction between carbon and oxygen in the blast furnace. In steelmak-
ing, oxygen is used to selectively oxidize carbon, silicon, manganese and phosphorus from the blast
furnace iron, steel scrap and other metallic additions to the furnace. Oxygen is also combined with
many different fuels to create heat which is used to increase the temperature of refractories in ladles
and steel in reheat furnaces.
5.4.1.2 Safe Practices 
Oxygen is not flammable, but vigorously accelerates the burning of combustible materials. There-
fore, it is important to keep combustibles away from oxygen and eliminate ignition sources. Oxygen
concentrations exceeding 23% by volume in air significantly increase the risk of ignition and fire.
Do not smoke or use an open flame where oxygen is stored, handled or used. Do not use cleaning
agents that leave organic deposits on the cleaned surfaces. Do not place oxygen equipment on
asphalt surfaces or allow equipment to come into contact with grease or oil. Equipment to be used
in contact with oxygen should be handled only with clean gloves or hands washed clean of oil. Any
equipment that comes into contact with oxygen should be cleaned for oxygen service using the
guidelines published by the Compressed Gas Association, Inc. using Pamphlet G–4.1 Cleaning
Equipment for Oxygen Service and CGA Pamphlet G–4.4 Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxygen
Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems. Read and understand the supplier Material Safety
Data Sheet (MSDS) for oxygen.
5.4.2 Nitrogen
Nitrogen is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It is only slightly soluble in water and is a poor conduc-
tor of electricity. The volume percentage of nitrogen in the air we breathe is approximately 78%.
5.4.2.1 Chemical Properties 
Nitrogen neither burns nor supports combustion. Although it does not react readily with most mate-
rials, at high temperatures nitrogen combines with hydrogen to from ammonia; with oxygen to form
nitrogen oxides; and with some of the more active metals, such as calcium, sodium, chromium, mag-
nesium and silicon to form nitrides.  At room temperature, nitrogen reacts with lithium.
5.4.2.2 Safe Practices
The displacement of breathing air is a potential hazard when using nitrogen to purge or inert a con-
fined space. Its density at ambient temperature is about 3% lighter than air. Nitrogen can displace
normal breathing air and cause rapid asphyxiation. Therefore, the oxygen level in any enclosed
space that may be entered by personnel must be maintained above 19.5% using forced-air convec-
tion, if necessary. If this is not practical, then access to the enclosed area should be locked and
entry allowed only after the area has been purged with air and tested for a safe oxygen level. Read
and understand the supplier MSDS for nitrogen.
5.4.3 Argon
Argon is colorless, odorless and tasteless  Approximately 1% of the air we breathe is argon.

5.4.3.1 Chemical Properties
Argon is non-toxic and chemically inert. It is non-flammable, does not present a fire hazard, and
in fact, inhibits combustion. Because of its properties, argon is used to provide an inert atmosphere
for molten steel to prevent the reoxidation of deoxidants such as aluminum, silicon and calcium.
Argon is also used as a purge gas by injecting it subsurface into liquid steel to remove dissolved
oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.
5.4.3.2 Safe Practices
The displacement of breathing air is a potential hazard when using argon to purge or inert a con-
fined space. As a gas at ambient temperature, argon is about 38% heavier than air. This means that
in confined spaces or large containers with closed bottoms, argon will accumulate in the bottom of
the space or container. Argon can displace normal breathing air and cause rapid asphyxiation.
Therefore, the oxygen level in any enclosed space that may be entered by personnel must be main-
tained above 19.5% using forced-air convection, if necessary. If this is not practical, then access to
the enclosed area should be locked and entry allowed only after the area has been purged with air
and tested for a safe oxygen level. Read and understand the supplier MSDS for argon.
5.4.4 Hydrogen
Hydrogen is an element which at atmospheric temperatures and pressures exists as a colorless, odor-
less, tasteless, flammable non-toxic gas. It is the lightest gas with a specific gravity of only 0.0695.
Its concentration in the atmosphere is only 0.0001–0.0002% by volume at sea level. Hydrogen dif-
fuses rapidly through porous materials and through some metals at red heat. It may leak out of a sys-
tem which is gas tight with respect to air or other common gases at equivalent pressure.
5.4.4.1 Chemical Properties
Hydrogen burns in air with a pale blue, almost invisible flame. The ignition temperatures of hydro-
gen-air and hydrogen-oxygen mixtures vary depending on composition, pressure, water vapor
content, and initial temperature. At atmospheric pressure, the ignition temperature of either hydro-
gen-air or hydrogen-oxygen mixtures will not vary greatly from the range 1050–1074°F. The flam-
mability limits of hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen mixtures depend on initial pressure,
temperature, and water vapor content. In dry air at atmospheric pressure the lower limit is 4.1%
hydrogen, and the upper limit is 74.2% hydrogen by volume. In dry oxygen at atmospheric pres-
sure the lower limit is 4.7% hydrogen and the upper limit is 93.9% hydrogen by volume. Hydrogen
is fundamentally a reducing agent. Either used alone or mixed with other gases, it is used to pro-
vide a non-oxidizing atmosphere in annealing and heat treating.
5.4.4.2 Safe Practices
Hydrogen is non toxic, but it can act as a simple asphyxiant by displacing the oxygen in the air.
Unconsciousness from inhaling air which contains a sufficiently large amount of hydrogen can
occur without any warning symptoms such as dizziness. Still lower concentrations than those
which could lead to unconsciousness would be flammable, since the lower flammable limit of
hydrogen in air is only 4% by volume. All the precautions necessary for the safe handling of any
flammable gas must be observed with hydrogen. Read and understand the supplier MSDS for
hydrogen.
5.4.5 Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide in its most common form is a gas, but depending on the temperature and pressure it
may exist as a gas, liquid or solid. Carbon dioxide comprises approximately 0.038% by volume of the
earth's atmosphere at sea level. It is a product of human and animal metabolism and is important to
the life cycle of all types of vegetation. Gaseous carbon dioxide is about 1.5 times as heavy as air.

5.4.5.1 Chemical Properties
Carbon dioxide is nontoxic, soluble in water, colorless and normally odorless. In high concentra-
tions, above 5,000 ppm, carbon dioxide can be detected as it dissolves in the moisture of the
mucous membranes in the nasal passages. The sensation produced has been described as a pungent
or irritating odor. Carbon dioxide is cooled and compressed to form a colorless liquid with approx-
imately the same density as water. At temperatures above 87.8°F (31°C), carbon dioxide cannot be
liquefied regardless of the pressure applied. Carbon dioxide is used to create an inert atmosphere
for various metal working applications and for some molten metal subsurface stirring applications.
5.4.5.2 Safe Practices
Carbon dioxide can cause rapid asphyxiation if released in large quantities into a confined area
lacking adequate ventilation. Carbon dioxide will replace normal air, giving no warning that a non-
life-supporting atmosphere is developing. Any atmosphere that does not contain enough oxygen
(19.5% by volume) can cause dizziness, unconsciousness and death. An oxygen-deficient atmos-
phere is created when carbon dioxide gas displaces air, causing the oxygen content to decrease.
Because carbon dioxide is 1.5 times more dense than air, it accumulates in low (below grade) or
confined areas. Breathable air is forced upward as the carbon dioxide concentration in a confined
area increases. Continued increases in carbon dioxide concentration could force all breathable air
out of an area.
Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the blood via the lungs and, to some extent, the skin. The symptoms
associated with inhalation of carbon dioxide are not normally noticed until the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the air is so high that there is insufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to support
life. The sign and symptoms of carbon dioxide over-exposure are the same as those preceding
asphyxia, namely, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, muscular weakness, drowsiness and
ringing in the ears. Read and understand the supplier MSDS for carbon dioxide.

6.1 Fuels, Combustion and Heat Flow
Any substance capable of producing heat by combustion may be termed a fuel. However, it is cus-
tomary to rank as fuels only those which include carbon and hydrogen and their compounds. Wood
was the earliest fuel used by man. Coal was known to exist in the fourth century B.C., and petro-
leum was used by the Persians in the days of Alexander. Prehistoric records of China and Japan
are said to contain references to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating.
Heat generated by the combustion of fuel is utilized in industry directly as heat or is converted into
mechanical or electrical energy. Fuel has become the major source of energy for manufacturing
enterprises.
Fuel enters significantly into manufacturing costs, and in some industries represents one of the
largest items of expense. The steel industry is one of the major consumers of metallurgical coal
and also consumes large quantities of electricity, natural gas and petroleum.
Energy conservation efforts and technological improvements have combined to decrease domestic
steel industry energy consumption from 34.40 gigajoules per net tonne (29.58 million Btu/ton) of
shipments in 1980 to 24.44 gigajoules per net tonne (21.02 million Btu/ton) of shipments in 1995
per AISI survey data. The actual total steel industry average has dropped to an even lower value
because most of the non-surveyed companies are electric arc furnace based, which inherently con-
sume fewer gigajoules per net tonne (Btu/ton).
6.1.1 Classification of Fuels
There are four general classes of fuels; namely, fossil, byproduct, chemical and nuclear. Of these
classes, the first three listed achieve energy release by combustion of carbon and/or hydrogen with
an oxidant, usually oxygen; the process involves electron exchange to form products of a lower
energy state and results in an energy release in an exothermic reaction. The fourth class liberates
energy by fission of the nucleus of the atom and converting mass into energy.
Fossil fuels are hydrocarbon or polynuclear aromatic compounds composed principally of carbon
and hydrogen and are derived from fossil remains of plant and animal life. These fossil remains
have been transformed by biochemical and geological metamorphoses into such fuels as coal, nat-
ural gas, petroleum, etc.

Byproduct and waste fuels are derived from a main product and are of a secondary nature.
Examples of these fuels are coke breeze, coke-oven gas, blast-furnace gas, wood wastes, etc.
Chemical fuels are primarily of an exotic nature and normally are not used in conventional
processes. Examples of these fuels are ammonium nitrate and fluorine.
Nuclear fuels are obtained from fissionable materials. The three basic fissionable materials are
uranium–235, uranium–233 and plutonium–239.
Fossil and byproduct fuels currently used in the steel industry are classified further into three gen-
eral divisions; namely, solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. Fuels in each general division can be clas-
sified further as natural, manufactured or byproduct. Fuels found in nature sometimes are called
primary fuels; those manufactured for a specific purpose or market, together with those that are
the unavoidable byproduct of some regular manufacturing process, are called secondary fuels. The
primary fuels serve as the principal raw materials for the secondary fuels. Table 6.1 gives a classi-
fied list of the important fossil fuels. It also lists some interesting byproduct fuels, many of which
have been utilized by industry to conserve primary fuel.
6.1.1.1 Importance of Each Class
Coal is the major fuel of public utilities for the generation of power and is essential to the steel
industry for the manufacture of coke.
Coal has been supplanted almost entirely by liquid fuels for the generation of motive power by rail-
roads in North America. However, coal continues as a major raw material for many chemical plants
as a source of carbon, hydrogen, and their compounds.
The growth of petroleum consumption has resumed after the price shocks of the past two decades
due to the increasing demand for its distillation products. Gasoline, the most important product, is
used as a motor fuel. Diesel engine fuel is a distillate of crude oil. Distillate and residual fuel oils,
and some crude petroleums of too low commercial value for distillation are used for industrial and
domestic heating. Crude and refined petroleum of various grades are used for lubrication of all
types of machinery and prime movers. Petroleum and natural gas are raw materials for the petro-
chemical industry.
Natural gas has replaced coal to a considerable extent for domestic and industrial heating due to
the installation of very large pipelines from producing to consuming centers, the relative level in
the price of natural gas over the intervening time, and its convenience, cleanliness, controllability
and versatility as a fuel. The byproduct gaseous fuels—coke-oven gas and blast furnace gas—are
major integrated steel industry fuels.
The nuclear energy industry has fallen on hard times. The development of a practical method for
fission of the atom and the release of nuclear energy in controlled chain reactions had given rise
to a different type of power generation system. Many large reactors were built throughout the coun-
try and are still in operation. However, no new units are under construction or are being designed.
Nuclear power will contribute an ever decreasing share of power to the electric grid as units are
taken out of service unless some major breakthrough in design and operation occurs.
6.1.2 Principles of Combustion
Fossil and byproduct fuels consist essentially of one, or a mixture of two or more, or of four com-
bustible constituents:  (1) solid carbon, (2) hydrocarbons, (3) carbon monoxide, and (4) hydrogen.
In addition to these combustible constituents, nearly all commercial fuels contain inert material,
such as ash, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. Bituminous coal is an example of a fuel which
contains all four of the combustible constituents named above, and coke is an example of a fuel
containing only one (solid carbon). The constituents which make up liquid fuels and many coals
are quite complex, but because these complex constituents decompose or volatilize into the four

simpler constituents named above before actual combustion takes place, a knowledge of the com-
bustion characteristics of these constituents is sufficient for nearly all practical applications. All of
these four constituents of fuels except carbon are gases at the temperatures where combustion
occurs. Combustion takes place by combining oxygen, a gas present in air, with the combustible
constituents of a fuel. The complete combustion of all fuels generates gases. It is apparent, there-
fore, that a review of the properties, thermal values and chemical reactions of gases is necessary
for an understanding of any class of fuel.
Because fuels are used to develop heat, a knowledge of heat terms and the principles of heat flow
are also essential for the efficient utilization of this heat. The combustion of fuels involves, besides
combustion reactions, the factors and principles which influence speed of combustion, ignition
temperature, flame luminosity, flame development, flame temperature and limits of flammability.
The ensuing divisions of this section deal generally with these subjects. Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4,
respectively, deal specifically with the combustion of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels.
6.1.2.1 Units for Measuring Heat
Heat is a form of energy and is measured in absolute joules in SI units.
In the centimetre-gram-second (cgs) the unit for measuring heat was the calorie (abbreviated cal),
defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of pure, air-free water
1°C in the temperature interval of 3.5° to 4.5°C at normal atmospheric pressure: this unit was the
gram-calorie or small calorie, identified in the Table 6.2 as cal4°C. The temperature interval chosen
for this definition was selected because the density and, therefore, the heat capacity of water varies
slightly with temperature and the temperature of maximum density of water is very nearly 4°C. A
larger heat unit in the cgs system was the kilocalorie (kilogram-calorie or large calorie), equal to
1000 gram-calories and abbreviated kcal.
Other values for the calorie were obtained by selecting other temperature intervals, resulting, for
example, in the call5°C and the cal20°C listed in Table 6.2. Yet another variation was the mean calo-
rie (abbreviated calmean), defined as 1/100 of the amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of one gram of water from 0°C (the ice point) to 100°C (the boiling point).
None of the foregoing definitions of the calorie were completely satisfactory because of the vari-
ation of the heat capacity of water with temperature. Consequently, on the recommendation of the
Ninth International Conference of Weights and Measures (Paris, 1948), the calorie came to be
defined in energy units in ways that made its value independent of temperature. The thermochem-
ical calorie (abbreviated calthermochem) was defined first in international electrical-energy units and
later (1948) in terms of mechanical-energy units. The calorie used in the present International
Tables, identified as calIT was adopted in 1956 at the International Conference on Properties of
Steam in Paris, and is expressed in mechanical-energy units.
As stated above, the SI unit used to define the calorie in terms of mechanical-energy units is the
absolute joule: the word “absolute” differentiates the SI joule based on mechanical-energy units
from the international joule formerly used which was based on international electrical units.
The presently accepted values in absolute joules of the various calories discussed above are pre-
sented in Table 6.2 here.

In the foot-pound-second (fps) system, the principal unit adopted for measuring heat was the
British thermal unit (Btu). Defined as the amount of heat required to raise by 1°F the temperature
of one pound of pure, air-free water, its value depended upon the temperature interval chosen for
its complete definition. As in the case of the calorie, several values came into use, notably the
Btu39°F based on a 1°F rise in temperature at or near the temperature of maximum density of water
(39.2°F), the Btu59°F based on the temperature interval of 58.5°F to 59.5°F corresponding nearly to
the 14.5°C to 15.5°C interval of the cal15°C, the Btu60°F based on the temperature interval from 60°F
to 61°F, and the mean Btu (Btumean) that represented 1/180 of the heat required to raise the tem-
perature of a pound of water from 32°F (the freezing point) to 212°F (the boiling point). Other val-
ues for the Btu were adopted, based on definitions that made the unit independent of the properties
of water:  these included the Btu of the International Tables referred to above (abbreviated BtuIT,
and the thermochemical Btu (designated Btuthermochem). Following the recommendations of the
1948 International Conference on Weights and Measures, all of the foregoing values for the Btu
came eventually to be expressed in SI mechanical-energy units, and now have been assigned the
values presented in Table 6.3 in absolute joules.
When both are determined for the same temperature interval, 1 Btu equals very nearly 252 calo-
ries, and 1 kilocalorie (1000 cal) very nearly equals 3.9683 Btu.
6.1.2.2 Calorific Value of Fuel
The heat given up or absorbed by a body between two temperatures, provided no change of state
or of allotropic form is involved, is known as sensible heat. The heat given up or absorbed by a
body when a change of state or of allotropic form takes place and no temperature change is
involved is known as latent heat. For example, 1 kilogram of water absorbs 418.68 kilojoules of
sensible heat when being heated from 0°C to 100°C, and absorbs 2257.1 kilojoules of latent heat
when converted to steam at 100°C. Likewise, 1 pound of water absorbs 189.9 kilojoules (180 Btu)
of sensible heat on being heated from 32°F to 212°F, and absorbs 1023.8 kilojoules (970.4 Btu) of
latent heat when converted to steam at 212°F.
Sensible heat and latent heat are used frequently in combustion calculations, particularly in prob-
lems dealing with heat losses in flue gases. Their significance is indicated in describing gross and
net heating values.
The gross heating value of a fuel is the total heat developed by the combustion of a fuel at constant
pressure after the products of combustion are cooled back to the starting temperature, assuming
that all of the water vapor produced is condensed; that is, the gross heating value includes both sen-
sible and latent heat. The net heating value of a fuel is defined as the heat developed by the com-
bustion of a fuel at constant pressure after the products of combustion are cooled back to the
starting temperature, assuming that all of the water vapor remains uncondensed. Accordingly, the
net heating value includes only the sensible heat.
Where combustion calculations in this chapter are in SI the starting point is 273.15K (0°C) at
101.325 kPa (760 mm Hg) absolute pressure. Where the calculations are in cgs units, the starting

point is 0°C at 760 mm absolute pressure. The starting point for calculations in the fps system in
this chapter has been taken as 60°F at 30 in. of Hg absolute pressure; this has generally been the
base for combustion calculations in the American steel industry.
When a fuel contains neither hydrogen nor hydrocarbons, no water vapor is produced by combus-
tion and the gross and net heating value will be the same, as in the case of burning carbon or car-
bon monoxide. The heating value or calorific value of a fuel may be determined on a dry or wet
basis. The determination may be made by laboratory tests employing calorimeters, or by calcula-
tion. The process of determining the calorific value of solid and liquid fuels by a calorimeter con-
sists in completely oxidizing the fuel in a space enclosed by a metal jacket (called the bomb) so
immersed that the heat evolved is absorbed by a weighed portion of water contained in an insulated
vessel. From the rise in temperature of the water, the heat liberated by one gram of the fuel is cal-
culated. The best types of calorimeters for solid and liquid fuels are those called oxygen-bomb
calorimeters in which the fuel is burned in the presence of compressed oxygen. Gas calorimeters
are of different construction to permit volumetric measurement of the gas and its complete com-
bustion under non-explosive conditions, as well as absorption of the heat produced in a water
jacket.
A saturated gas is one which contains the maximum amount of water vapor it can hold without any
condensation of water taking place. The usual basis for reporting the calorific value of a saturated
fuel gas in SI units is in gross kilojoules per cubic metre measured at 273K and 101 kPa absolute
pressure. In the cgs system, calorific value usually has been reported in gross kilocalories per cubic
metre measured at 0°C and 760 mm Hg absolute pressure. In fps units in the American steel indus-
try, calorific value usually has been reported in gross Btu per cubic foot of saturated gas measured
at 60°F and 30 in. Hg absolute pressure.
The heating value of a given fuel can be obtained by multiplying the calorific value of each gas by
its percentage of the total fuel volume, and then totaling the individual values of the separate con-
stituents. The heat of combustion for various dry elementary gases may be found in Table 6.4. For
instance, the gross heating value of dry blast-furnace gas is 3633 kilojoules per cubic metre (92.5
Btu per cubic foot) for the composition used in the following calculations.
In the calculation of the heating value of gases saturated with water vapor, the volume of water
vapor must be deducted from the unit volume of the gas. For instance, a cubic metre of dry carbon
monoxide gas has a heating value of 12,623 kilojoules, but when saturated with water vapor at
273K (0°C) and 101 kPa (760 mm Hg), a cubic metre has a heating value of only 12,405 kilojoules
(see Table 6.4). Likewise, a cubic foot of dry carbon monoxide gas has a heating value of 321.4
Btu, but when saturated with water vapor at 60°F and 30 in. Hg absolute pressure, a cubic foot has
a heating value of only 315.8 Btu. The amount of water vapor present in saturated mixtures can be
calculated from data in Table 6.5, as discussed in Section 6.1.2.4.
6.1.2.3 Thermal Capacity, Heat Capacity and Specific Heat
The thermal capacity or heat capacity of a substance is expressed as the amount of heat required
to raise the temperature of a unit weight of the substance one degree in temperature. In SI, it is
expressed in joules per kilogram Kelvin (J/kg K). The fps system has used Btu per pound per
degree Fahrenheit (Btu/lbm °F), while the cgs system has used calories per gram per degree Celsius
(cal/g °C). The specific heat is always a ratio, expressed as a number; for example, the specific heat
of wrought iron is 0.115. There is no further designation, as this means that if it takes a certain
number of joules to heat a certain number of kilograms of water a certain number of Kelvins, it
will take only 0.115 times as many joules to heat the same number of kilograms of wrought iron
the same number of Kelvins, and the same figure, 0.115, obviously applies if the centimetre-gram-
second or foot-pound-second system were used.
The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of equal masses of different substances to the
same temperature level varies greatly; that is to say, the specific heat varies greatly; also the spe-
cific heat of the same substance varies at different temperatures. Usually, it is necessary to know

Formula

the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance some appreciable amount. For
that purpose, formulae and tables are usually accessible in handbooks for supplying the mean spe-
cific heat between various temperature levels. Two values of specific heat for gases are usually
given:  (1) specific heat at constant pressure, and (2) specific heat at constant volume. The differ-
ence is due to the heat equivalent of the work of expansion caused by an increase of volume result-
ing from a temperature rise. Normal combustion practice with gases in steel plants deals with a
constant pressure condition (or nearly so), and for this reason specific heat at constant pressure is
used. The mean specific heat is the average value of the specific heat between two temperature lev-
els. It is obtained by integrating the equations for instantaneous specific heat over the temperature
limits desired, and dividing this quantity by the difference between the temperature limits.

The heat content is the heat contained at a specified temperature above some fixed temperature. It
is calculated by multiplying the weight of a substance by the mean specific heat times the temper-
ature difference, or Ht 5 weight 3 mean specific heat 3 (T2 – T1). For convenience in calculations
with gases, the unit weight of the volume of a cubic metre or a cubic foot of gas is often used.
6.1.2.4 Gas Laws
Calculations based on the gas laws to be discussed involve the concepts of absolute zero and
absolute temperature. Absolute zero in SI is 0K, in the cgs system it is –273.15°C and in the fps
system it is –459.67°F: for practical purposes to facilitate calculations, –273°C and –460°F can be
taken as absolute zero in the cgs and fps systems, respectively.
Absolute temperature in SI is the temperature expressed in Kelvins above 0K at an absolute pres-
sure of 101.325 kPa (one standard atmosphere). In the cgs system, absolute temperature (°Cabs) has
been the temperature in degrees Celsius (formerly called degrees centigrade) above –273.15°C at
760 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury) at one standard atmosphere absolute pressure. Absolute tem-
perature in the cgs system also has been expressed according to the Kelvin scale of temperature,
using K instead of °C, (1°C 5 1K). Absolute zero on the Kelvin scale is 0K, and on the Celsius
scale absolute zero, as stated above, is –273.15°C. Temperatures on the Kelvin and Celsius scales
have the following relation:
TK 5 T°C 1 273.15
or, to facilitate calculations,
TK 5 T°C 1 273
(6.1.1)
Absolute temperature in the fps system is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°Fabs) above
459.67°F at 29.921 inches of mercury (one standard atmosphere) absolute pressure. Also in the fps
system, absolute temperatures have been expressed according to the Rankine temperature scale,
using degrees Rankine (°R) instead of degrees Fahrenheit (°F), (1°R 5 1°F). Absolute zero on the
Rankine scale is 0°R, and on the Fahrenheit scale absolute zero, as stated above, is –459.67°F.
Temperatures on these two scales have the following relation:
T°R 5 T°F 1 459.67
or, to facilitate calculations,
T°R 5 T°F 1 460
(6.1.2)
Again to facilitate calculations, rounded values for an absolute pressure of one atmosphere (101
kPA in SI and 30 in. Hg in the fps system) can be used instead of the more precise values in the
definitions.
The volume of an ideal gas varies in direct proportion to its absolute temperature (Charles’ Law)
and inversely as its absolute pressure (Boyle’s Law).
For example, in SI units, the volume of 1000 m3 of a gas measured at 288K (15°C) and 101 kPa
absolute pressure, when heated to 1253K (980°C) and 101 kPa absolute pressure, is equal to:
1000 3 1253/288 5 4351 m3
and the volume of 1000 m3 of fuel gas measured at 288K(15°C) and 101 kPa absolute pressure is
equal to 802 m3 when compressed to 25 kPa gauge pressure at 288K, calculated as follows:
1000 3 101/(101125) 5 802 m3
Similarly, in the fps system, the volume of 40,000 ft3 of gas measured at 60°F and 30 in. Hg
absolute pressure, when heated to 1800°F and 30 in. Hg absolute pressure, is equal to:
40,000 3 (460 1 1800)/(460160) 5 174,000 ft3

319

and the volume of 40,000 ft3 of fuel gas measured at 60°F and 30 in. Hg (standard conditions) is
equal to 31,579 ft3 when compressed to 8 in. Hg gauge pressure at 60°F, calculated as follows:
40,000 3 30/(3018) 5 31,579 ft3
The total pressure of any gas mixture is equal to the sum of the pressures of each component. Each
component produces a partial pressure proportional to its concentration in the mixture. Therefore,
in a mixture of water vapor and any other gas, each exerts a pressure proportional to its percentage
by volume, and since water has a definite vapor pressure at various temperatures, as shown in Table
6.5, the concentration of water vapor in a gas is limited. When this limit of water vapor is reached,
the gas is said to be saturated. Any drop in temperature or increase in pressure from that point will
cause condensation of some of the water vapor; for instance, the water vapor in 1000 m3 of satu-
rated fuel gas at 293K (20°C) and 101 kPa would equal:
1000 3 2.3378/100 5 23.1 m3
(2.3378 kPa is the partial pressure of water vapor in a saturated mixture at 293K (20°C) and 101
kPa as shown in Table 6.5.) In fps units, water vapor in 1000 ft3 of saturated fuel gas measured at
60°F and 30 in. Hg is calculated as follows:
1000 3 0.522/30 5 17.40 ft3
(0.522 is the partial pressure of water vapor in a saturated mixture at 60°F and 30 in. Hg, from
Table 6.5.) The amount of water vapor which will condense at various temperatures may be ascer-
tained by the use of Table 6.6.
In some combustion calculations, it is necessary to convert volumes to weights and vice versa.
Such conversions can be made very conveniently by using molar units; namely, the mole (abbrevi-
ated mol and expressed in kilograms) in SI; the gram-mole (abbreviated g-mol and expressed in
grams) in the cgs system; and the pound-mole (abbreviated lb-mol and expressed in pounds) in the
fps system. A mol, g-mol or lb-mol of a substance is that quantity whose mass expressed in the
proper units stated above is the same number as the number of the molecular weight. Thus, the mol-
ecular weight of oxygen is 32, so that the mol in SI is 32 kg of oxygen, the g-mol in the cgs sys-
tem is 32 grams of oxygen, and the lb-mol in the fps system is 32 lb of oxygen.
In SI, a mol of any gas (its molecular weight in kilograms) theoretically occupies 22.414 m3 at
273.15K and 101.325 kPa absolute pressure. (Values of 22.4 m3, 273K and 101 kPa are close
enough for most calculations.) In the cgs system, a g-mol of any gas (its molecular weight in
grams) theoretically occupies 22.414 dm3 at 0°C and 760 mm Hg absolute pressure. In the fps sys-
tem, a lb-mol of any gas (its molecular weight in pounds) theoretically occupies 359 ft3 at 32°F
and 29.921 in. Hg absolute pressure; or, at 60°F and 30 in. Hg absolute pressure (the usual refer-
ence points for combustion problems in the steel industry) a lb-mol occupies 378.4 ft3. The sim-
plicity of using molar units in combustion calculations is shown by the following examples: The
weight of a cubic metre of dry air is calculated in SI as follows:
0.21 (% vol. of O2 in air) 3 32 (mol. wt. of 02) 5 6.72
0.79 (% vol. of N2 in air) 3 28 (mol. wt. of N2) 5 22.12 
Weight in kg of a mol of dry air 5 28.84.
28.84/22.4 5 1.29 kg (weight per m3 of dry air at 273K and 101 kPa absolute pressure)
The volume of 1 kg of dry air at 273K and 101 kPa absolute pressure is equal to:
22.4/28.84 5 0.78 m3
In the cgs system, the calculations would be similar to those in SI, except that the weight of a gram-
mol of dry air would be determined to be 28.84 grams, and the weight of a cubic decimetre (liter)
of dry air would be found to be 1.29 grams: the volume of 1 gram of dry air at 0°C and 760 mm
Hg would be found to be 0.78 dm3.

In the fps system, the weight of a lb-mol of dry air would be determined to be 28.84 lbm, (lbm
denotes pounds-mass and replaces the previous designation lb) and the weight of 1 ft3 of dry air at
60°F and 30 in Hg would be:
28.84/378.4 5 0.076 lbm (weight per ft3 of dry air at 60°F and 30 in. Hg absolute pressure)
Also, the volume of 1 lbm of dry air at 60°F and 30 in. Hg would be
378.4/28.84 5 13.1 ft3
The relation of an ideal gas to its volume and pressure is expressed by the formula:
PV 5 nRT
(6.1.3)
where:
R 5 gas constant
P 5 absolute pressure
V 5 volume
n 5 number of mols
T 5 absolute temperature of gas

The numerical value of R in the above equation depends upon what units (SI, cgs or fps) are used
to measure P. V, n and T. Values of R for various combinations of units for measuring the other
quantities are as follows:
SI units
R 5 8.3144 kJ/mol K
CGS units
R 5 8.3144 J/g-mol K
R 5 62.37 mm Hg-dm3/g-mol K
R 5 .08206 dm3-atm/g-mol K
FPS units
R 5 10.703 lbf ft3 in2/lb-mol °R
R 5 21.83 in. Hg-ft3/lb-mol °R
In SI units, an example of the use of the foregoing formula would be to calculate the volume occu-
pied by 100 kg of natural gas having a composition of 80% CH4, 18% C2H6 and 2% N2 by volume
at a gauge pressure of 27 kPa and a temperature of 38°C (using the data from Table 6.4).
The weight of a mol of the gas is:
CH4 5 0.80 3 16 5 12.8 
C2H6 5 0.18 3 30 5

Substituting these values into the equation 6.1.3 for a perfect gas:
128V 5 5.33 3 8.3144 3 311
V 5 107.7 m3
In fps units, a similar application of the formula would be to calculate the volume occupied by 100
lbm of natural gas of the same composition as above at 8 in. Hg gauge pressure and a temperature
of 100°F.

6.1.2.5 Combustion Calculations
The combustion of fuels is carried out by chemical reaction with air, and occasionally with air
enriched with oxygen, or with pure oxygen. Dry air is a mixture of the following gas volumes
under average conditions:
N2
5 78.03%
O2
5 20.99%
Ar
5
0.94%
CO2
5
0.03%
H2
5
0.01%
Total 5 100.00%
In combustion calculations it is customary to include all elements in dry air (other than oxygen)
with the nitrogen, as shown below:

Only the oxygen in the air reacts with a fuel in combustion processes. The nitrogen acts as a dilu-
ent which must be heated up by the heat of the reaction between the oxygen and the fuel. It, there-
fore, reduces, the temperature of the flame and reduces the velocity of combustion.
Water vapor which is present in air also acts as a diluent. The amount of moisture present in air is
generally stated in terms of humidity. Air is capable of being saturated with water vapor the same
as other gases as described in Section 6.1.2.4. Air which is saturated completely with water vapor
has a humidity of 100%; if only 50% saturated, it has a humidity of 50% (Table 6.6).
The principal combustion reactions are:
C 1 O2 5 CO2
2CO 1 O2 5 2CO2
2H2 1 O2 5 2H2O
CH4 1 2O2 5 CO2 1 2H2O
2C2H6 1 7O2 5 4CO2 1 6H2O
C2H4 1 3O2 5 2CO2 1 2H2O
2C3H6 1 9O2 5 6CO2 1 6H2O
2C2H2 1 5O2 5 4CO2 1 2H2O
2C6H6 1 15O2 5 12CO2 1 6H2O
2H2S 1 3O2 5 2 SO2 1 2H2O
The amount of oxygen required and consequently air, together with the amount of the resultant
products of combustion, may be calculated in SI by the use of mols and the proper chemical reac-
tion. For instance, it will require (32 4 12) or 2.667 kg of O2 to burn 1 kg of C, and as dry air con-
tains 23.11% by weight O2, the weight of dry air required to burn one kilogram of carbon will be
(2.667 3 0.2311) or 11.540 kg. The product of combustion, CO2, will amount to [(12 1 32) 4 12]
5 3.667 kg.
Combustion calculations using gases are more conveniently made in volumetric units. For instance,
to burn a cubic metre of CO completely to CO2 requires 1/2m3 of O2 in accordance with the molec-
ular relationship in the reaction. The dry air required would be (0.5 4 0.209) or 2.382 m3. For burn-
ing a cubic metre of methane, CH4, to CO2 and H2O, the air required would be (2.0 4 0.209) or
9.528 m3.
The foregoing calculations may be performed with fps units by substituting pounds-mass (lbm) for
kilograms and cubic feet for cubic metres.
Combustion calculations are necessary to determine the air requirements and the products of com-
bustion for burning fuels of various compositions. The percent of air used above theoretical
requirements is called percent excess air; the percent below, the percent deficiency of air. Typical
combustion data on a dry basis for burning gaseous fuels of the compositions stated are shown in
Table 6.7. In making calculations to include the water vapor which may be present in a saturated
or partially saturated gas and in air, the same general method may be used by adding water vapor
to the fuel gas composition, and by adding the volume of water vapor which is introduced through
air in the products of combustion column, headed H2O.
In order to maintain combustion, a fuel must, after it has been ignited, be able to impart sufficient
heat to its air-gas mixture so that it will not drop below ignition temperature, the minimum point
of self-ignition. Too lean or too rich a mixture of a fuel with air is unable to support combustion.
An upper and lower limit of flammability exists for all gases. The limits of flammability, as well as
ignition temperatures, for a number of gases are shown in Table 6.8.
In the design of burners or in the selection of fuel for a specific purpose, consideration of velocity
of combustion is of major importance. Because gaseous fuels are composed usually of a mixture
of combustible gases, a knowledge of the relative combustion speed of each elementary gas will
provide means for evaluating this factor in any gaseous mixture. The velocity of combustion, or
rate of flame propagation, of a given fuel, is influenced by three factors:  (1) degree to which the
air and gas are mixed, (2) temperature of the air-gas mixture, and (3) contact of the air- gas mix-
ture with a hot surface (catalyst). By intimately mixing air and gas, combustion may be accelerated

and a shorter, sharper flame developed. In the case of a gas containing large amounts of hydrogen,
intimate mixing will provide a combustion reaction of explosive velocity relative to that of a gas
containing large amounts of methane. Inert gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, present in
fuel gases or in a gas-air mixture, reduce combustion velocity. The proportion of nitrogen in a fuel
gas-air mixture may be reduced by oxygen enrichment of air for combustion, and combustion
speed may, by this means, be accelerated many fold. Such measures also will raise the flame tem-
perature. The use of preheated air for combustion also accelerates combustion of gases. In order to
burn large volumes of fuel in a small space, a mixture of air and gas is sometimes directed against
a hot, incandescent surface. By increasing the velocity of combustion, higher temperatures are
localized close to the burner point. This condition is desirable for some processes and highly unde-
sirable for others. For instance, the scarfing process requires a highly intensive localized heat,
while the heating of steel for rolling requires a lower intensity distribution of heat over the full sur-
face of the pieces being heated. In order to reduce combustion speed of a gaseous fuel, the air and
gas streams may be stratified to produce slow mixing. Such a method creates a diffusion flame, a
long flame of relatively uniform temperature with a relative higher degree of cracking of the hydro-
carbon components.
Theoretical flame temperature is the temperature which would be attained by the products of com-
bustion if the combustion of a fuel took place instantaneously, and there were no loss of heat to the
surroundings. Such a condition never exists, but theoretical flame temperature represents another
measure for comparing fuels. Fuels which develop a high flame temperature by combustion are
more capable of producing a higher thermal efficiency in practice than those which develop low
flame temperatures. The efficiency of heat utilization is the relation of the total heat absorbed by a
substance to the heat supplied. Because the temperature level at which waste gases leave a furnace
is usually fixed within a relatively narrow range, the higher the flame temperature the higher the
potentiality for heat absorption by the substance to be heated. The theoretical flame temperature of
a fuel may be calculated by balancing the sum of the net heating value of a given quantity of fuel
and the sensible heat of the air-gas mixture against the heat content of the products of combustion.

Theoretical flame temperature so calculated should be corrected for dissociation of CO2 and H2O
at temperatures in excess of 1650°C (3000°F). The theoretical flame temperatures for a number of
important gaseous fuels are given in Table 6.23 in Section 6.4.5. The reader is referred to the Gas
Engineers Handbook and the books by Lewis and von Elbe, by Hougen et al., and Trinks and
Mawhinney and others listed in the bibliography at the end of this chapter for a full explanation of
combustion stoichiometry, fuel economy calculations and the calculation of theoretical flame tem-
peratures, and the dissociation of gases at elevated temperatures.
There are a number of factors which determine the character, size and shape of a gas flame. Gases
burned at very high combustion velocity will produce very little or no luminosity regardless of the
kind of gas. The velocity and volume with which the air-gas stream leaves a burner or furnace port,
the fuel-air ratio, and the amount of non-combustible material in the fuel will influence the length
and shape of a flame. The kind of gas to be burned has a very great effect upon the character of the
flame. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen burn with an invisible to a clear blue flame, while the
hydrocarbon gases, methane, ethane, etc. are capable of developing highly luminous flames. The
principal reason that these gases burn with a luminous flame is due to the thermal breakdown of
the hydrocarbons into carbon and hydrogen, and under combustion conditions which permit this,
the carbon particles are heated to incandescence thereby giving the flame its luminous appearance.
The luminosity of a flame may be decreased or increased by varying the supply of air. A deficiency
of air below theoretical requirements will increase luminosity and it also usually will lengthen the
flame. An excess of air will decrease luminosity and shorten the flame with most burners or fur-
nace ports. Increasing the temperature of preheat of the air for combustion will reduce luminosity,
as is also the case when water vapor (steam), which may be introduced with the gas, air, or for
atomization of liquid fuels, is increased. A luminous flame has a number of desirable qualities, the
principal one being its greater ability to transfer heat by radiation from a fixed temperature level.
However, it should be noted that a luminous flame is obtained usually at a lower temperature level
than when the same fuel is burned with a lower degree of luminosity.
6.1.3 Heat Flow
Heat flow is caused by a difference in temperature, and heat is transmitted in three ways, namely,
by conduction, by convection, and by radiation
6.1.3.1 Conduction
Conduction is the transmission of heat through a solid body without visible motion of the body, as
through a steel bar. The amount of heat transferred through a homogeneous solid by conduction is
expressed by the formula:
q 5 (k A DT)/ x
(6.1.4)
where, in SI, the quantities are expressed in the following units:
q
5 watts transmitted (1 W 5 1 J/s)
k
5 conductivity factor in W/m K
A
5 area in m2
DT 5 temperature difference in K

6.1.3.2 Convection
When heat is transmitted by the mechanical motion of gas or water currents in contact with a solid,
or by gas currents in contact with a liquid, the transfer of heat is by convection. In the transfer of
heat by convection, it is necessary to conduct heat through the relatively stationary film between
the moving and stationary bodies. This film becomes thinner as the velocity of the currents paral-
lel to its surface increases. The transfer of heat by convection is expressed by the formula:
q 5 U A Dt
(6.1.6)
where, in SI, the quantities are expressed in the following units:
q

gravity and viscosity of the moving fluid and the conductivity of the film

gravity and viscosity of the moving fluid and the conductivity of the film

6.1.3.3 Radiation
Radiation refers to the transmission of heat through space without the help or intervention of mat-
ter. This is the means by which the heat of the sun reaches the earth, and by which much of the heat
of combustion of fuels is utilized in high-temperature processes in the steel industry. When radi-
ant energy strikes any body a certain proportion of the total is reflected, while that absorbed is
reconverted to heat energy. A perfect black body is one that will not reflect radiation falling upon
it but absorbs all of it. The coefficient of reflectivity of a body receiving radiation is equal to one
minus its black body coefficient. Emissivity refers to the rate at which a body radiates heat in rela-
tion to a black body of equal area, and this rate depends upon the temperature of the body and the
nature of its surface. Kirchoff’s Law shows that the absorptivity and emissivity of a given surface
are numerically equal at the same temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law states that the total
energy of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature, that is:

where, in SI units, W equals the total emissive power of a black body, expressed in watts per square
metre (W/m2), s is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant equal to 5.71 3 10–5 ergs/cm2 s K4 or 5.71 3
10–8 watts per m2 K4 and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvins (K).
In fps units, W is expressed in Btu/ft2 h °R4 and s equals 0.173 3 10–8 Btu/ft2 h °R4 with T rep-
resenting the absolute temperature in °R.
The net effect of heat transfer between two bodies, neither of which can be considered a black
body, must take into account the emissivity factor e, which is the ratio of the emissive power of an
actual surface to that of a black body; this results in the following equation in SI units:

rial, its surfaces face finish, and its temperature. Polished metal surfaces have low emissivities,
whereas those of oxidized surfaces and non-metals generally approach a value of one. In the gen-
eration of heat from fuels, the character of the flame and its proximity to the receptor of heat is par-
ticularly significant in the transfer of heat by radiation. The amount of heat transferred from a
flame varies widely and in proportion to its degree of luminosity. The transfer of heat by radiation
varies inversely with the square of the distance between the transmitter and receptor of radiant
energy. For that reason, flames should be kept close to the substance to be heated where high heat
transfer rates are desirable.
6.2 Solid Fuels and Their Utilization
Solid fuels have played a significant role in the evolution of our modern, industrial civilization.
Coal in particular has been of far-reaching importance in that it has provided the prodigious
amount of energy essential to the development of the iron and steel industries. Vast quantities of
this energy source remain to be exploited, but the rate of utilization far exceeds the rate at which
coal is being formed. It follows that the efficient use of the remaining supply is desirable. Toward
this end, modern coal research is directed.
Geologically, the earliest-formed coal thus far encountered occurs in the Silurian strata of
Bohemia. It is not until Lower Carboniferous time, see Table 6.10, however, that the source materials

of coal began to accumulate in significant quantities. Every continent, including Antarctica, con-
tains some coal and no system of rocks younger than the Silurian is devoid of this important sub-
stance. In North America major concentrations of source materials were accumulated during the
Carboniferous, Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. A similar statement can be made for Europe but,
in contrast, some of the most important Asiatic coals occur in Triassic and Jurassic rocks of the
Mesozoic Era.
6.2.1 Coal Resources
The known coal deposits in the U.S. are greater than those of any other country. Based on 1995
International Energy Annual data, the U.S. identified recoverable coal reserves of all ranks were
estimated to be 246 billion metric tons (272 billion short tons) which is approximately 24% of the
known world reserves. This figure represents coal of all ranks in the ground at depths and bed
thicknesses generally considered mineable under current economic conditions. This would be
enough to supply requirements for a long period in the future if all present coal reserves were avail-
able economically and of acceptable quality. A considerable quantity of the reserves of better qual-
ity coking coal has been utilized in the past and it is apparent that in the future it will be necessary
to use coals requiring efficient extraction, cleaning, and other processing to assure proper utiliza-
tion.
For obvious reasons, the steel industry has been striving to use coals which would produce metal-
lurgical coke of optimum quality with a minimum of processing. Concentrations of coals of this
class are found chiefly in the Appalachian area, although isolated deposits also exist in some
Central and Western states. The preponderance of total coal reserve in the U.S. is in the form of
lower-rank coals in the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Coast states and the Gulf
region, see Fig. 6.1. These western coals are taking a larger share of the electric utility market due
to lower sulfur content and lower mining costs. As a result, the eastern share of national produc-
tion fell to 53% in 1995 from the 93% level in 1970. Total domestic coal production is still increas-
ing and reached 937 million metric tons (1,033 million short tons) in 1995.
6.2.1.1 Origin and Composition of Coal
Coal is known to be a complex mixture of plant substances which have been altered in varying
degrees by physical and chemical processes. Ordinarily, plant material, upon death, completely
decomposes because of the action of microorganisms. Under certain circumstances, notably those
associated with forested fresh-water swamps, this action is inhibited by antibiotic solutions which
are common in this type of environment. As a result, the rate of accumulation of the plant mater-
ial exceeds that of its decomposition and dispersion. Under such conditions a brown fibrous
deposit known as peat is formed. Peat is the first step in the formation of coal.
Peat deposits, formed millions of years ago, subsequently were submerged through vertical move-
ments of the earth’s crust, in which position they became covered by deposits of sedimentary rocks.
Later movements of the earth’s crust raised many of these deposits to various heights above sea
level. In the meantime, the peat had been changed, through agencies of biological action, pressure,
and heat, into coal. The better ranks of coal in this country were formed during the Carboniferous
period, the geologic period when conditions were most favorable for plant accumulation and
decomposition. Included in the present deposits that originated in that period are the coal fields of
the Appalachian and Central states.
The rate at which peat forms depends upon the rapidity of plant growth and the manner in which
tissue increment is related to the rate of decomposition. It has been estimated that approximately
one century is required to form a deposit of mature, compacted peat about one-third metre (one
foot) in thickness. Certain studies of volatile matter relationships suggest that about a one-metre
thick (a three-foot-thick) deposit of mature peat is required to produce a one-third-metre thick
(one-foot-thick) layer of bituminous coal. These and other data indicate that a coal seam which is
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

a metre or more (several feet) thick may require a time span of thousands of years for its forma-
tion. If, in the course of time, the peat is subjected to the necessary conditions it becomes modi-
fied to brown coal and, when adequately consolidated, to lignite. From the lignitic stage, the
material passes progressively through the sub-bituminous, bituminous, semi-anthracite and
anthracite stages with a gradual change in the composition of the individual components of the
complex mass. The proximate and ultimate compositions of coal, defined later in Section 6.2.3 and
shown in Tables 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13 illustrate the gradual concentration of carbon and loss of oxy-
gen in the various stages of coal formation.
Peat varies in appearance from a light, brown-colored, fibrous material to a very black and dense,
muck-like sediment. Lignite is usually brown in color and commonly shows a woody texture. It
contains a large amount of moisture and usually disintegrates, or slacks, into small pieces as it dries
on exposure to air. Sub-bituminous coal varies in color from very dark brown to black and frac-
tures irregularly. Bituminous coal is black in color and usually exhibits a banded structure due to
the alternate dull and vitreous layers of varying thickness. Coals of the high-volatile bituminous
rank commonly burn with a smoky, yellow flame. Anthracite is black, hard and brittle and has a
high luster. It ignites less easily than bituminous coal and burns with a short, bluish, yellow-tipped
flame producing very little or no smoke. The characteristics of semi-anthracite coal are intermedi-
ate between those of bituminous coal and anthracite.
All of the solid natural fuels contain both combustible and non-combustible materials. The com-
bustible material is composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, sulfur. The non-

combustible constituents are water, nitrogen and oxygen, and a variety of mineral materials usually
referred to as ash.
The bituminous coals are of greatest interest to the steel industry in view of the fact that essentially
all coking coals fall in this category. The lustrous black bands which are conspicuous in a lump of
bituminous coal are generally referred to as vitrain although some American coal petrographers
employ the term anthraxylon in preference. Following U.S. Bureau of Mines terminology, the
anthraxylon is derived from woody plant tissues and is surrounded by a dull ground mass made up
of translucent attritus, opaque attritus and fusain. The attrital portion is composed of finely com-
minuted fragments of altered plant materials. Fusain is a friable, charcoal-like substance derived
from woody tissues and is a term used universally without modification. 
In addition to the readily recognizable bands of vitrain and fusain, European and Asiatic coal inves-
tigators have found it useful to identify silky, minutely striated layers within a coal as clarain.
Layers of dull, compact coal are called durain. Thus, coal seams can be thought of as being com-
posed, usually, of various mixtures of vitrain, fusain, clarain and durain, each occurring in the form
of layers which are visually observable. Coals made up largely of vitrain and clarain are spoken of
as bright coals whereas coals containing a high percentage of durain are called splint coals. Bright
coals are generally better coking coals than splint coals, vitrain apparently playing an important
part in the carbonization process. Fusain will not coke, but in small percentages it may actually
increase coke strength provided the particle size is fine enough. The fixed carbon content is higher
and the volatile matter content is lower in fusain than in the other banded ingredients.
Microscopic study has shown the banded components to be composed of identifiable plant entities
called phyterals, but of greater significance is the fact that the vitrain, fusain, clarain and durain
are made up of numerous components or macerals which can be defined by their physical and
chemical properties. Durain, for example, may include several macerals (vitrinite, semi-fusinite,
micrinite, cutinite, etc.) which are easily distinguished by their differing optical properties.
Additional information regarding the nature and variability of these individual coal components
and their contribution to the effective and efficient utilization of all types of coal appears in refer-
ences on applied coal petrography at the end of this chapter.

6.2.1.2 Chemical Composition and Coal Classification
There are two methods commonly employed to determine the chemical composition of coal;
namely ultimate analysis and proximate analysis (Table 6.12). An ultimate analysis determines the
quantities of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine and ash in dry coal; a proximate
analysis determines the fixed carbon, volatile matter, moisture and ash contents. The proximate
analysis is used most commonly because it furnishes most of the data required for normal com-
mercial evaluations.
The analysis of coal can be made in the laboratory on an ‘air-dry’ basis. The coal sample is deliv-
ered to the laboratory in sealed containers. In the laboratory, the coal is weighed and then exposed
to the air of the laboratory for a period of time and then weighed again. The percent loss in weight
is the ‘air-dry’ loss. However, since the air-dry analysis is of little value to the user, the analysis is
converted to the ‘as-received’ basis by combining air-dry loss and final moisture content.
(6.2.1)
The heating value of coal is reported on as-received basis and dry basis. To convert the analysis to
dry basis from the as-received basis, each constituent value (except the moisture because that is
being eliminated) is divided by the factor
(6.2.2)
Typical ranges of moisture are listed for various coals in Table 6.11 and Table 6.13.
Using data provided by chemical, physical or petrographic analyses, coals are classified according
to rank, grade, and type. Classification according to rank is based upon the degree of metamor-
phism within the coal series from the level of lignite to that of anthracite coal. The American
Society for Testing and Materials ranks coals according to their fixed-carbon content on a dry
basis, and the lower rank coals according to Btu content on a moist basis. The classification of
coals by rank adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM Specification
D388), is shown in Table 6.14.

(a) This classification does not include a few coals, principally nonbanded varieties, which have unusual physical and chemical properties and which come within the limits of
fixed carbon or calorific value of the high-volatile bituminous and subbituminous ranks. All of these coals either contain less than 48% dry, mineral-matter-free fixed carbon
or have more than 15,500 moist, mineral-matter-free British thermal units per pound (36,100 kJ per kg).
(b) Moist refers to coal containing its natural inherent moisture but not including visible water on the surface of the coal.
(c) If agglomerating, classify in low-volatile group of the bituminous class.
(d) Coals having 69% or more fixed carbon on the dry, mineral-matter-free basis shall be classified according to fixed carbon, regardless of calorific value.
(e)It is recognized that there may be nonagglomerating varieties in these groups of the bituminous class, and there are notable exceptions in high volatile C bituminous group.

In the U.S., coals are also classified into types and such terms as bright, semi-splint, splint, cannel
and boghead coal are applied. The data required are obtained from microscopic studies. The U.S.
Bureau of Mines defines bright coal as containing less than 20% opaque matter; semi-splint must
have between 20 and 30%, and splint coal must be made up of more than 30% of this ingredient.
Cannel and boghead coals are non-banded and are characterized by a small percentage of anthraxy-
lon (vitrain). Boghead possesses a high percentage of volatile oils and gases, and contains an abun-
dance of algal material. Cannel, or candle, coal is so named because it can be ignited with a match
or a candle flame and it burns with unusual brilliance. Cannel coal is non-coking, often contains
large quantities of spore and pollen materials, and like boghead, has a high content of volatile oil
and gas.
Coals are classified to grade by their ash and sulfur contents. The mineral constituents of the ash
are also important because they influence fouling and slagging in the furnace.
6.2.2 Mining of Coal
It is found that seams of coals vary in thickness throughout the world from a few millimetres to
over 75 metres (a fraction of an inch to over 250 feet). In this country the thickest seams are found
in the sub-bituminous coals of the West, one of which approaches about 30 metres (100 feet). In
the East, the Mammoth bed in the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania attains a thickness of 15 to 18
metres (50 to 60 feet) but is found to be quite variable when traced laterally. The Pittsburgh seam
at the base of the Monongahela series in the Appalachian area is noteworthy because of its excep-
tionally uniform thickness (approximately 2 metres or 7 feet) over thousands of square miles. Fig.
6.2 shows the western portion of Pennsylvania in such a manner as to make clear the areal extent
as well as the sub-surface relations of the coal-bearing formations of this region. Data are provided
in Table 6.15 as to thickness of seams and distance between coals.
Coal seams may dip gently as shown in Fig. 6.2, or they may be horizontal, or they may exist
almost vertical with respect to the Earth’s surface. Mining problems are often complicated by the
fact that seams seldom remain in the same plane throughout their extent. Under present conditions,
a coal bed must be at least 0.75 to 0.90 metres (30 inches to 36 inches) thick to be profitable for

S. Geological Survey estimates of coal reserves do not include coal seams deeper than about 910
metres (3000 feet) from the surface, although in Great Britain and Europe coal seams at greater
depth are being mined.

The mining of coal is performed by either one of two methods:  (1) open pit or stripping, also called
contour mining, or (2) underground or deep mine. The first method involves removing the forma-
tion (over-burden) above the seam by stripping with scrapers, bulldozers, or mechanically operated
shovels, followed by removing the exposed coal. Stripping is applied to coal seams which are rel-
atively close to the surface, particularly to thick seams underlying overburden about 25 to 50
metres (80 to 150 feet) deep, although the development or larger equipment and improved tech-
niques in recent years has justified removal of layers of overburden thicker than this. Auger min-
ing is being used extensively to recover coal where the overburden is too great for strip-mining
practices to be employed. A large-diameter auger or drill with cutting bits on its end is propelled
into the exposed edge of a coal seam. As the auger progresses into and along the seam, the broken
coal is conveyed away from the face through the tube to the outside for transport away from the
auger. Production by strip mining has increased greatly since World War I due to reduced labor and
material costs and a quicker return on capital investment compared to underground mining. In the
U.S., surface mining accounted for slightly over 25% of the coal produced in 1957. By 1995, sur-
face mining has climbed to about 62% of the total coal mined.
6.2.2.1 Underground Mining
Underground mining is performed by either the room-and-pillar or the longwall method. The
room-and-pillar method is in more common use in the U.S. The longwall method is particularly
adaptable to mining seams up to about 4.6 metres (15 feet) thick under conditions where the roof
may be permitted to cave. It is used more extensively in the mines of the eastern U.S. There are a
number of modifications applicable to each method. The room-and-pillar system consists essen-
tially of working out rooms, chambers, or breasts in the coal seam from passages (entries) driven
from the mine entrance. Entrance to an underground mine is by drift, shaft or slope. The rooms
vary in width from about 3.5 to 12 metres (12 feet to 40 feet), 6.1 metres (20 ft.) being the most
common, and from about 45 to 90 metres (150 feet to 300 feet) in length, depending on such fac-
tors as weight and character of the overlying and underlying structure and thickness of seam. Pillars
separating the rooms vary in width from about 2 to 30 metres (6 feet to 100 feet), depending on
conditions and mining practice. These pillars are sometimes removed by retreat mining and the
coal recovered.
In the longwall method, a continuous mining face is maintained in the coal seam. After mining, the
roof is permitted to cave, about 5 to 9 metres (15 or 30 feet) from the mine working face.
Prior to the advent of mechanical mining, undercutting of the coal seam preparatory to blasting was
done manually. Production per man was low by this method and required a number of working
faces in the mine to produce high mine tonnage. Hand loading of coal into mule-drawn cars was
the prevailing practice for many years until development of machinery for cutting, loading and
haulage. Electric trolley-type locomotives capable of hauling longer underground trains of cars of
increased capacity displaced mule-drawn trains as mine capacity increased.
In some modern underground mines, the coal is carried out of the mine by a system of conveyor
belts to a shipping station or cleaning plant. In other mines, the coal is carried in mine cars to a
rotary dumper. From the dumper the coal is fed by way of a conveyor or elevator to a shipping sta-
tion or cleaning plant.
6.2.2.2 Continuous Mining
The cutting machines and loading machines characteristic of mechanical mining in the past were
single-purpose units, and each performed essentially a single function of mining at the working
face. After either unit completed its work it was withdrawn from the face to allow other units of
the production setup to move up to the face to carry out succeeding functions. To keep all operat-
ing units working at full efficiency, it was necessary to have additional working places near at hand
so that the single-purpose machines could enter the places in rotation and carry out their functions
without interference.
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

To eliminate some of the difficulties attendant upon the addition of extra working places, multi-
purpose machines known as continuous miners have been developed and the operation carried out
by such machines has been given the name continuous mining. Continuous miners combine in a
single unit the actions of dislodging the coal from the solid seam and loading it into some unit of
a transportation system. Such machines, therefore, combine in one operation the separate steps of
cutting, drilling, blasting and loading common to earlier mechanical mining methods. Coal plan-
ers and shearers with long-wall mining achieve these combined objectives.
There are several types of continuous miners in operation, one of which is a ripper-type miner that
has cutting bits mounted in the rims of multiple wheels that are rotated to rip the coal out of the
seam while the ripper wheels are propelled into and up or down in the coal seam. The coal that is
ripped loose from the seam falls into the gathering head of the loader, which has dual gathering
arms that sweep the broken coal into the conveyor section of the machine for loading into shuttle
cars or other suitable conveying equipment. 
Continuous miners of some other types employ auger-type cutters that bore into the face, the cut
coal in both cases being carried by a conveyor on the machine to a shuttle car or other means of
transportation.
6.2.3 Coal Preparation
As one phase of coal preparation, the objective of coal cleaning (often called washing) is removal
of solid foreign matter, such as rock and slate, from the coal prior to its use. Reduction of ash and
sulfur contents; control of ash fusibility; increase of heating (calorific) value; and improvement of
coking properties of the coal can be achieved by this practice. From a coal-cleaning standpoint, the
impurities in coal are of two types; namely, those which cannot be separated from the coal, usually
called fixed or inherent impurities; and those which can be removed, herein referred to as free
impurities. Altogether, these impurities are of eight types, named as follows:  (1) residual inorganic
matter of the coal-forming plants from which the coal was derived; (2) mineral matter washed or
blown into the coal-forming mass during the periods of its formation; (3) pyrites (FeS2) formed by
bacterial reaction of iron and sulfur in the coal-forming matter; (4) sedimentary deposits during the
coal-forming periods which appear as partings, sometimes called “bone,” that usually must be
mined with the coal; (5) massive deposits formed through deposition on bedding planes; (6) saline
deposits, somewhat rare in coal beds of the U.S.; (7) slate, shale, clay, etc. from the underlying and
overlying strata accidentally included in mining; and (8) water or moisture, which includes that nat-
urally carried by the coal in air-dry condition, and excess moisture producing a condition of wet-
ness. Items (1) (2) and, for the most part (3) form fixed ash, while (4), (5), (6), and (7) are partly
free ash-forming materials that can be removed by hand-picking and suitable mechanical cleaning
treatments. Item (8) involves drying operations differing from those required to separate mineral
impurities, which is the primary objective of cleaning. Mechanical cleaning is possible because of
the difference in specific gravity between the major impurities and the coal, the density of the for-
mer being 1.7 to 4.9, while pure coal has a density of about 1.3. Sulfur is present as pyrites, organic
compounds, and sulfates, and only part of the pyrites can be removed by cleaning. Phosphorus is
usually associated more with bony and impure coal than with clean coal and is, therefore, reduced
by washing. Salts, particularly the alkali chlorides, lower the fusion point of the ash, affect coke-
oven linings and are troublesome in waste liquors from coking operations.
The advent of full-seam mechanical coal mining and the increasing need for metallurgical coke of
low and uniform ash and sulfur contents has focused attention on the needs for the most efficient
types of washers.
The preparation of coal starts at the production face in the mine. If loading is done by hand, the
miner is required to discard all rock and slate over 75 mm (3 in.) size. As practically all loading
is done mechanically in the U.S. little attempt is made to prepare the coal at the face other than
to control the tonnage from various sections of the mine if sulfur content of the coal is high or
variable.

The cleaning qualities of a particular coal are determined by the float and sink test, commonly
referred to as a washability test. Fundamentally, this test effects a fractionation of the coal by size
and specific gravity. This test consists in crushing coal to proper size and floating individual sizes
of it on liquids having specific gravities of 1.30, 1.40, 1.50, 1.60, etc., to determine the weight and
character of the material that floats and sinks in each liquid. The proportion of coal, and the ash
and sulfur content of the different fractions, provides reasonably complete data on the washability
characteristics of a tested coal. Extreme fines may be evaluated by froth flotation.

A complete description of each of the foregoing processes would be too lengthy for inclusion
herein; hence only a brief review will be given of the principles of some of the more important
types of cleaning processes in use at present. A reference list for further study of this subject is
appended to this chapter.
Jigs were probably the earliest type of machine used in the mineral industry to separate materials
of different densities. They consist essentially of a box with a perforated base into which the mate-
rial is placed, and by alternate surges of water upward and downward through the perforations,
materials of different specific gravities stratify. Materials having the highest specific gravities
remain at the bottom while the lighter material rises. With proper mechanical facilities, a continu-
ous separation is achieved. While jigs are not very efficient in cleaning a mixture of various sizes,
they are capable of satisfying some market requirements, and capacities up to about 450 metric
tons (500 net tons) per hour have been obtained.
In dense-media processes, only a part of the power for separating coal and refuse is supplied by an
upward flow of liquid, this separating power being supplemented by using a liquid medium which
is heavier than water. The medium employed is a mixture of water and some finely divided solid
material, such as sand, magnetite, or barite, which can be separated readily from the washed coal
and reused. In the high-density suspension process, the upward flow is discarded entirely, the liq-
uid medium consisting of a mixture which is just dense enough so that the coal floats in it, and the
impurities sink. The size of coal has less significance in the efficiency of this process than of those

previously described, and material ranging from 1.6 to 254 mm (1/16 inch to 10 inches) can be
cleaned in one operation. However, difficulty is encountered in separating the solid material from
coal of fine size. Capacities up to about 545 metric tons (600 net tons) per hour have been obtained
with bituminous coal. The Chance cone method, which uses a mixture of sand and water, is also
widely used in the U.S. The Tromp and Barvoys processes, using magnetite and barite respectively
as the solid material in the mixture, are used extensively in Europe and in the U.S. In these
processes, the specific gravity of the mixture of solid material and water can be varied by chang-
ing their proportions to suit the optimum conditions in cleaning. Agitation in the separating cone
is supplied by an upward current of water and by mechanical stirring.
Cyclones, which have an inverted conical shape and are fed tangentially at the widest part of the
cone, are used with the dense medium process to increase the separating rate of particles in the
medium. This device is particularly effective on sizes between 3/4 inch (17 mm) and 100–mesh
(0.15 mm). Cyclones can also be used in the absence of a specific medium, but the efficiency is
lower and they must often be combined in stages. In this practice they are referred to as hydro-
clones or water-only cyclones.
Coal is also cleaned on table concentrators. Essentially these tables consist of a slightly inclined
rectangular surface having a series of parallel grooves or cleats. The tables are mechanically agi-
tated to permit stratification of the light and heavy material and to cause the heavy material to move
with the long axis of the table. A current of water is introduced at the top edge of the table to wash
the coal which has settled above the refuse to the discharge edge of the table. The refuse which set-
tles underneath the coal moves longitudinally down the table and is discharged at the end. Tables
have been used principally for cleaning coal of the smaller sizes, from about 0.3 to 12.7 mm
(48–mesh up to about 1/2 in.).
Froth flotation of coal involves agitating fine coal with a mixture of water and a relatively small
quantity of some frothing agent. In this process, coal is buoyed to the surface by the froth and
removed while refuse settles. It is widely used to recover coal finer than 100–mesh (150 mm).
With practically all wet-washing systems the water is recirculated. When the water passes through
the dewatering screens it contains a considerable amount of small-size coal solids which must be
recovered for efficiency reasons. Also, the circulating water and effluent from flotation must be
clarified before it is returned to the cleaning unit. This clarification is accomplished in various
ways, the most important being by the use of hydraulic cyclones followed by a Dorr-type thickener.
Settling cones and settling tanks are also used for this purpose. Where the Dorr-type thickener and
settling tanks are used, it is customary to draw off the settlings in the form of a slurry containing
40% to 60% solids and to further separate the slurry in a vacuum-type filter. The filters deliver a
product with approximately 25% moisture. For a more complete discussion of dewatering and
waste disposal, the reader is referred to a standard book on coal preparation.
6.2.4 Carbonization of Coal
The most important use of coal in the modern steel industry is in the manufacture of metallurgical
coke, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 7 in the Ironmaking Volume.
The carbonization of coal in byproduct ovens entails the production of large amounts of coke-oven
gas and tar, important fuels in the steel industry, as well as light oils and various coal chemicals.
The yields of gas and tar are largely a matter of the type of coal used and the temperatures
employed in coke manufacture.
6.2.5 Combustion of Solid Fuels
The principal combustion reactions of solid fuels have been given in Section 6.1.2, and this pre-
sent discussion will deal with operating factors pertinent to the combustion of solid fuels in steel
plants.

The combustion of coke in blast furnaces has been studied by a number of investigators, each of
whom has found that combustion takes place in a relatively small space directly in front of each
tuyere.
Coke breeze, produced by screening coke at both the coke plant and blast furnaces, is utilized as a
fuel in steel plant boiler houses to generate steam and in ore-agglomerating plants. When used as
boiler fuel, coke breeze is burned on chain-grate stokers. Of importance in the combustion of coke
breeze on chain-grate stokers is the maintenance of a relatively uniform fuel bed on the grate,
approximately 200 to 300 mm (8 to 12 in.) thick, to prevent blowholes, and a balanced or slight
positive pressure in the furnace at fuel-bed level. The operation of the grate should permit the nor-
mal combustion of approximately 146 kilograms per square metre (30 pounds of coke breeze per
square foot) of effective grate area per hour. Chain-grate stokers are particularly adaptable to solid
fuels with an ash of low fusion point. The design of front and back arches must take into consid-
eration the fuel to be burned on chain-grate stokers. The arches are utilized to reflect heat and
thereby aid ignition on the fuel bed.
Stokers for firing coal were generally used in steel plant boilers on units whose capacity is under
approximately 45,000 kilograms (100,000 pounds) of steam per hour and for units using exclu-
sively a solid fuel. They were often used on boilers to provide flexibility for the adjustment of
boiler output to the steam load in plants where there is an insufficient or fluctuating supply of
gaseous byproduct fuels. When coal is used as a boiler fuel today, pulverized boilers dominate the
field. The advantage of stokers lies in their ability to control easily the rate of combustion of a solid
fuel with efficient use of air. The combustion process on stoker-fired boilers consists essentially in
first driving the volatile matter from a continuous supply of fuel, and then oxidizing the carbon in
the residue on the stoker. The combustion of the coke-like residue on the grate produces CO2 and
CO. The CO and volatile matter are burned over the grate by secondary air admitted over the fuel
bed. The temperature of the fuel bed is affected by the rate of firing and, at the top or hottest part
of the bed, varies from about 1230°C (2250°F) at low to 1510°C (2750°F) at high rates. The
amount of primary air supplied determines the capacity of stoker-fired furnaces and the effective
use of secondary air determines the efficiency of combustion. In well operated and carefully sealed
boilers, approximately 20 to 30% excess air will permit combustion of the gases within seven or
eight feet above the grate. 
Stokers are classified in general according to the travel of the fuel. In an overfired stoker the fuel
is fed on top of the bed, and in an underfired or a retort stoker the fuel is fed at the bottom or side
of the bed. A traveling-grate or chain-grate stoker carries the bed horizontally on the flat upper sur-
face of a conveyor as in a chain-grate stoker. There are a number of modifications of these stoker
types. The spreader stoker projects the coal into the furnace above the fuel bed and the fuel is
burned both in suspension and on the fuel bed. While the fuel bed of a stoker-fired boiler is rela-
tively thin, usually from 100 to 300 mm (4 to 12 in.), compared to a gas-producer bed, similar zones
of reaction occur. In overfired stokers the ash zone is immediately above the grate, followed by the
oxidation, reduction and distillation zones. In underfired or retort stokers the distillation of the
volatile matter takes place in an oxidizing atmosphere and the volatile products pass through the
incandescent residue from combustion rather than through green coal, as in the case of overfired
stokers. The normal combustion rates on coal-fired stokers amounts to approximately 150 to 300
kilograms of coal per square metre (30 to 60 pounds per square foot) of effective grate area per
hour. 
6.2.5.1 Pulverized Coal
The cement industry was the first to use pulverized (powdered) coal extensively as a fuel. Public
utilities and the steel industry began applying pulverized coal on an experimental basis as a boiler
fuel around 1917, and by 1935 practically all large boilers (above about 45,000 kilograms or
100,000 pounds of steam per hour) in public utility power stations used this fuel, except for those
stations located in the vicinity of oil and natural gas fields where local fuels were more competi-
tive than coal. Large modern boiler installations in integrated steel plants generally use pulverized

coal if coal is utilized, either as a standby or as an auxiliary fuel, in conjunction with blast-furnace
gas for steam or power generation. Although pulverized coal has been used as a fuel for metallur-
gical purposes in steel plants, such as in open-hearth, reheating, forge and annealing furnaces,
today it is employed as an injectant in the blast-furnace tuyere to increase furnace performance and
efficiency.
Pulverized-coal firing offers important combustion advantages over grate firing and an economic
advantage over gaseous and liquid fuels in most sections of the country. Boiler capacities are not
limited as is the case with boilers equipped with stokers. Fine particles of coal burned in suspen-
sion are capable of developing a highly luminous high-temperature flame. Coal in this form may
be burned normally with less excess of air above theoretical requirements than with a solid fuel,
and the rate of heat release from the combustion of pulverized coal is greater than that accom-
plished with the solid fuel. Coal, when pulverized to the degree common for boiler uses (70%
through a 0.074 mm or 200–mesh screen), has the control flexibility of gaseous and liquid fuels.
Practically all ranks of coal, from anthracite to lignite, can be pulverized for combustion and each
possesses specific combustion characteristics which largely influence the extent of pulverization.
Pulverized-coal firing in modern boilers has certain inherent problems. Excessive fly-ash dis-
charge from the stack, high operating power consumption rates, excessive pulverizer maintenance
cost, erosion of induced-draft fan blades and other boiler components, and requirements for large
furnace volumes impose practical limitations in selecting this type of firing for low-capacity boil-
ers. Dust collectors are required to control stack particulate emissions, while scrubbers are required
to remove the sulfur from the waste gas stream.
The ash-disposal problem has been one of the principal deterrents to a more extended use of pul-
verized coal. In the cement kiln, coal ash is no problem as it is absorbed by the cement in the kiln
without adverse effect on the final product. In boilers, the principal difficulty of clogged boiler
tubes and deterioration of furnace walls has been overcome by the use of slagging-type furnaces in
which the ash in molten form is granulated by water jets at the bottom of the furnace well. The
introduction of the cyclone furnace, which offered the removal of the ash as liquid slag, further
increased the application of pulverized-coal firing for steam and power generation. This equipment
was developed to solve two major problems that beset the power engineer:  (1) the increasing
necessity to use low quality, high-ash fuels for steam generation; and (2) the requirement that as
much of the coal ash as possible be kept in the furnace and not permitted to go through the furnace
and out of the stack. However, the removal of ash as a liquid slag requires the use of coal having
ash of low fusion point and such special coal is sometimes difficult to obtain.
The problem of ash contamination resulting from burning fine particles of coal in suspension
above a metallic liquid bath or mass of hot steel, damage to refractories from the chemical or phys-
ical action of ash, and the clogging of furnace checkers or recuperators from ash accumulation, as
well as the normal availability of other fuels, has prevented widespread use of the fuel for metal-
lurgical purposes in steel plants.
Pulverized coal offers high boiler efficiency, and means for quick regulation of boiler load. The
rank of coal pulverized and the extent of pulverization particularly determine the speed of com-
bustion. A high-volatile coal will burn faster than anthracite coal, also one with a lower ash con-
tent will burn faster. The process of combustion with pulverized coal is similar to that of lump coal
but is of much higher velocity due to the introduction of the particle in suspension in a high-tem-
perature chamber, and the greater surface exposure relative to weight. The release of volatile mat-
ter in pulverized coal is practically instantaneous when blown into the furnace, and the speed of
combustion of the resulting carbonized particle and volatile gases depends upon the thoroughness
with which the pulverized coal has been mixed with air. High combustion temperatures, low ash
losses, and low excess air needs (10–20%), with resultant high boiler efficiencies (85– 90% with
good practice), make pulverized coal an ideal boiler fuel.
Air for combustion of pulverized fuel is generally preheated, with 10–50% of that required intro-
duced ahead of the pulverizer and the balance made up at a point near the burner. This method of

introducing the air helps dry the coal and maintains a nonexplosive mix in the pulverized coal
transmission system.
The combustion chamber size for pulverized coal is generally proportioned for a heat-release range
of from approximately 207,000–1,035,000 watts per cubic metre or 745,000–3,725,000 kilojoules
per cubic metre per hour (20,000–100,000 Btu per cubic foot per hour) of combustion space.
However, the cyclone furnace has heat-release rates of approximately 5,175,000–9,315,000 watts
per cubic metre or 18,625,000–33,525,000 kilojoules per cubic metre per hour (500,000–900,000
Btu per cubic foot per hour) within the cyclone chamber and the boiler furnace is used only for
extracting heat from the flue gases. The difference in requirements is dependent upon whether pul-
verized coal is the sole fuel to be used in the chamber, the size of the coal particles, the rank of
coal to be pulverized, the ash-slagging temperature of the coal, and the desired temperature for the
combustion chamber. Spreader-stoker installations offer low first cost for smaller-size boilers, and
the fly-ash emission from the boiler is not as severe as with the pulverized-fuel boilers.
Another technology is fluidized bed combustion which has been used to provide emission control
for high sulfur coals. In this type of firing, the fuel limestone sorbent particles are kept suspended
and bubbling or fluidized in the lower section of the furnace through the action of air under pres-
sure through a series of orifices in a lower distribution plate. The fluidization promotes the turbu-
lent mixing required for good combustion, which in turn promotes the three required parameters
for efficient combustion; time, turbulence, and temperature. The limestone captures the freed sul-
fur from the coal products of combustion to form calcium sulfate. The mixture of ash and sulfated
limestone sorbent discharged is a relatively inert material, disposal of which presents little hazard.
This type firing also achieves a measure of NOx control in that it burns at a lower temperature,
somewhat below maximum NOx formation.
6.3 Liquid Fuels and Their Utilization
Liquid fuels are essential to practically all parts of the American transportation system. The move-
ment of passengers and freight by highway and air is dependent upon gasoline and other products
of petroleum. The railways of the country have nearly all been equipped with diesel locomotives
powered by fuel oil. Nearly all ocean-going ships are driven by oil, as are the majority of lake and
river craft. Liquid fuels have also become of major importance as a source of heat and power in
manufacturing plants. The particular advantages of petroleum as a source of energy and the avail-
able supplies have brought about a phenomenal growth in the petroleum industry.
The oil industry has recovered from the traumatic price increases of the 1970s and early 1980s
which temporarily reduced the demand for oil products. The U.S. domestic demand for all oil prod-
ucts reached its low point in 1983 at 2.42 million cubic metres (15.23 million barrels) per day and
returned to its highest level since 1979 in 1994 at 2.82 million cubic metres (17.72 million barrels)
per day. During this period, the share of crude oil produced by the domestic oil industry has con-
tinued a steady decline to 1.06 million cubic metres (6.66 million barrels) per day in 1994 since
reaching a peak of 1.53 million cubic metres (9.64 million barrels) per day in 1970. Unless a major
new field is discovered, this decline in production and reserves will continue indefinitely.
Worldwide crude oil production in 1994 was also back to its highest levels since 1979 with a pro-
duction rate of 9.63 million cubic metres (60.58 million barrels) per day with OPEC countries
accounting for 41.1% of the total. This is still well below the 48.9% share OPEC held in 1979.
Fortunately, as consumption of oil products has risen over the last decade, so has the known world-
wide reserves. These reserves have stood at nearly 159 billion cubic metres (1,000 billion barrels)
since the beginning of the 1990s. This is over 30% above the levels of the 1970s with the OPEC
countries accounting for the majority of the increase.
Fuel oil is the principal liquid fuel used in the steel industry. Tar and pitch consumption has over
the years decreased considerably. Fuel oil is utilized predominantly in the blast furnace as an injec-

tant for coke replacement, in reheating furnaces as a substitute for gaseous fuels and in boilers as
a backup fuel for other byproduct fuels.
Tar and pitch are byproducts of the manufacture of coke. The virgin tar as it comes from the ovens
contains valuable tar-liquor oils which can be extracted and the residue pitch used as a fuel. It is
customary to mix virgin tar with this highly viscous residue to provide fluidity for facilitating han-
dling and burning, or to utilize tar in which only the lighter products have been removed by a top-
ping process by which sufficient fluidity is retained. Pitch-tar mixtures and topped tar make
available for use as a fuel 78 to 83% of the heat in the crude tar recovered in the distillation process.
6.3.1 Origin, Composition and Distribution of Petroleum
Classified according to their origins, three main types of rocks make up the outer crust of the earth:
igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks are formed from magma, a molten
(liquid or pasty) rock material originating at high pressures and temperatures within the earth. Lava
is magma that reaches the surface in the liquid or pasty state. Very commonly, the magma cools
and solidifies before reaching the surface. In any case, when the molten material cools sufficiently
to become solid, igneous rocks are the result. If cooling is slow, the rocks will be crystalline (gran-
ite, for example); but if the cooling is rapid, the rocks will not be crystalline but glassy in nature
(obsidian, for example). Because of the nature of their origin and their usually dense, nonporous
structures, igneous rocks are never hosts to petroleum deposits.
Sedimentary rocks are formed from eroded particles of rocks and soil, carried away by wind or
water (and sometimes glacial action) and deposited in seas, lakes, valleys and deltas in relatively
even, sometimes very thick, beds or strata (sandstones and shales are formed from deposits of this
type). Other types of stratified deposits may be formed by evaporation of land-locked seas (beds
of rock salt), by accumulation of the mineral remains of animals (composed chiefly of calcium car-
bonate, which is the principal constituent of limestone), or by chemical precipitation (gypsum and
some limestones originate in this manner). The beds of sand, silt, clay, calcium carbonate or what-
ever eventually are covered by other sedimentary deposits, sometimes to very great depths. With
the passage of long periods of time, pressure of the overlying strata, heat, cementation by chemi-
cal means, earth movements, or a combination of these or other agencies, the strata are consoli-
dated into sedimentary rocks, typified by the few mentioned parenthetically earlier. Petroleum
occurs almost entirely in sedimentary rock formations, principally sandstones and limestones,
under certain ideal conditions to be described later.
Metamorphic rocks originally were sedimentary or igneous rocks. Their composition, constitution
or structure have been changed through the single or combined action of natural forces such as
heat, pressure, or other agencies. Marble, for example, is metamorphosed limestone.
The organic theory of the origin of petroleum, generally accepted by geologists, is that petroleum
has been derived from either animal or vegetable matter, or both, by a process of slow distillation,
after its burial under beds of sediments. There is evidence to indicate that the animal and vegetable
matter was of marine origin; such evidence includes the association of brines with oil, the visible
oily coating on seaweed found in certain localities, and the optical phenomenon of light polariza-
tion by oils similar to that of substances found in certain plants and animals and which is not shown
by inorganically synthesized petroleum. The accumulation of the matter from which petroleum has
been derived, its burial by sedimentary material, and the action of pressure and heat to cause dis-
tillation, has resulted in petroleum formation in many parts of the world. Geological studies indi-
cate that petroleum was not formed in the pools in which it is found, but that the action of water
pressing against oil formations caused the petroleum to flow, over a period of many years, through
porous beds or strata to points of accumulation. Pools of oil occur in traps in sedimentary rocks
such as sandstone or limestone. Essentially, such traps are formed by an impervious layer which
prevents upward migration of the petroleum to any further extent. The oil is obtained by drilling
wells into these zones of accumulation. The well is encased in a steel pipe through which it is often
customary to run a number of smaller pipes to bring the product to the surface. These traps may be

formed in various ways, a few of which are illustrated schematically in Fig. 6.3. In the stratigraphic
trap, the producing formation gradually pinches out and disappears up the structure. An impervi-
ous layer is deposited on top of the sand, thus forming a cap rock. The solid black section in Fig.
6.3(a) represents petroleum accumulated below the cap rock. The salt dome is believed to be the
result of intrusion of large masses of salt into the sediments where they are found. This intrusion
creates an upward pressure and results in the doming of the overlying sedimentary rocks. In this
type of structure, petroleum accumulates within the upturned porous beds about the summit and
flanks of the salt core, as indicated by the solid black sections in Fig. 6.3(b). In an anticlinal struc-
ture, Fig. 6.3(c), the rocks comprising the crust of the earth are folded upward. The oil and gas are
usually found on the crest of an anticlinal structure. An impervious cap rock must be present to seal
the reservoir and prevent the escape of the gas and oil into higher layers. This cap rock, in one form
or another, must be present in all reservoirs to contain the oil and gas within the structure. A fault,
Fig. 6.3(d) is a structural closure caused by the fracturing of the crustal rocks during earth move-
ments. In the process of folding, a reservoir for oil may be formed when a porous rock is brought
into contact with an impervious layer, thus forming a trap.

Crude petroleum is a liquid containing a complex mixture of solid, liquid and gaseous hydrocar-
bons. The solid hydrocarbons are in solution and the liquid is at least partly saturated with gases
(methane, ethane, etc.). The elementary composition of American crude oils from representative
fields covers the following ranges:  carbon 84–87%, hydrogen 11.5–14.0%, sulfur 0.05–3.0%, and
nitrogen 0.01–1.70%
Ordinary crude petroleum is brownish-green to black in color with a specific gravity from approx-
imately 0.810 to 0.981, and an ash content of 0.01 to 0.05%.
The principal constituents in crude oil are the paraffin (CnH2n12), naphthene (CnH2n), and aromatic
(CnH2n–x) series of hydrocarbons, and asphaltic compounds. In paraffin- base crudes, such as found
in Pennsylvania, the asphaltic content is low, only traces of sulfur and nitrogen are found, and the
specific gravity averages approximately 0.810. In mixed-base crudes which have a lower content
of paraffins and a higher content of naphthenes than the paraffin-base crudes, the content of
asphaltic compounds is higher, the sulfur content usually is under 0.4% and the paraffin-wax con-
tent is generally high. Mixed-base crudes occur in the mid-continent region. The naphthene-base
crudes contain a high percentage of naphthenes and very little paraffin wax. They occur in the central,
south-central and south-western areas of the U.S. Light naphthene-base crudes contain a low pro-
portion of asphalt, compared to reverse proportions in heavy naphthene-base crudes. The sulfur con-
tent varies widely. The aromatic crudes, which occur chiefly in California, generally have a high
asphaltic-compound content, sulfur content varying from 0.1 to 4.13% and a relatively high nitrogen
content. The presence of wax is often widespread, although some crudes of this class are free of wax.
Crude oil is delivered by rail, ocean tankers, inland and intercoastal waterways, in specially con-
structed tanks, and by pipelines, including the Alaskan pipeline.
6.3.2 Grades of Petroleum Used as Fuels
Fuel oils may be classified generally as:  (1) raw or natural crude petroleums, (2) distillate fuel oils,
(3) residual fuel oils, and (4) blended oils. By the older methods of refining, the products from
many of the oil refineries west of the Mississippi River were gasoline, naphtha, kerosene and fuel
oil, while eastern refineries usually carried the fractionation of oil much further, their output being
such products as gasoline, benzene, naphtha, kerosene, light machine oil, automobile oils, cylinder
oils, paraffin wax and tar, pitch, or coke. Recent improvements in thermal cracking at both high
and low pressure and the use of catalytic conversion processes have enabled refiners to convert
more of the petroleum to gasoline and to produce lubricants from western petroleum relatively high
in asphalt.
Distillate fuel oils consist of the fractions distilled intermediate between kerosene and lubricating
oils. Residual fuel oils are the viscous residual products remaining after the more volatile hydro-
carbons have been driven off in the refining process. Blended oils are mixtures of any or all of the
three classes of fuel oils. The distribution of products obtained from crude oil in a sample of eight
refineries is listed in Table 6.16.

6.3.3 Properties and Specifications of Liquid Fuels
Before discussing the more important properties and specifications of fuel oil, some of the com-
mon terms will be reviewed. Further details may be found in the ASTM Standards for Petroleum,
Section 5, cited in the references at the end of this chapter.
Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of a body to the weight of an equal volume
of some standard substance. In the case of liquids, the standard is water. Baumé gravity is an arbi-
trary scale for measuring the density of a liquid, the unit being called Baumé degree. Its relation to
specific gravity is shown by the formula:
(6.3.1)
For example, the Baumé hydrometer will read 10° Bé in pure water, when the specific gravity scale
reads 1.00.
The American Petroleum Institute (API) Gravity is a modification of the Baumé scale for light liq-
uids. API gravities are always reported at 15°C (60°F). The relation between API gravity and spe-
cific gravity is:
(6.3.2)
The greater the degrees Baumé or API, the lighter or lower in density the fluid. There are roughly
90 API degrees between the heaviest and lightest oils which, therefore, make this scale valuable for
determining differences between the density of various oils.
Flash point is the lowest temperature at which, under specified conditions, a liquid fuel vaporizes
rapidly enough to form above its surface an air and vapor mixture which gives a flash or slight
explosion when ignited by a small flame. It is an indication of the ease of combustion or of the fire
hazard in handling or using oil.
Pour point is the lowest temperature at which oil will pour or flow when chilled without disturbance
under specified conditions.
Viscosity is the property of liquids that causes them to resist instantaneous change of shape or
rearrangement of their parts due to internal friction. Since this property has a direct relation to
resistance of flow in fuel-oil pipe systems and to atomization, it is an important specification.
Absolute viscosity is a measure of internal fluid friction. It is defined as the tangential force on unit
area of either of two parallel planes a unit distance apart when the space between the two planes is
filled with liquid and one of the planes moves relative to the other with unit velocity in its own
plane, and is also referred to as dynamic viscosity.
The unit for expressing absolute viscosity in SI is the Pascal-second (Pa s). By definition the pas-
cal equals one Newton per square metre (N/m2) and the Newton has the formula kg m/s2, thus the
dimensions for the Pascal-second are kilograms per second per metre (kg/s/m). One Pascal-second
is equal to 0.1 poise or 10 centipoises (the poise and centipoise are defined below).
The cgs unit of absolute viscosity is the poise, which has the dimensions, grams per centimetre per
second (g/s/cm). The centipoise is 1/100 of a poise and is the unit of absolute viscosity most com-
monly used in cgs. One poise equals 10 Pa s (the SI unit) and one centipoise equals 0.1 Pa s.
Absolute viscosity in the fps system is expressed in pounds force per second per foot (lbf/s/ft) The
absolute viscosity of water at 20°C (68°F) in SI equals 0.1 Pa s; in the cgs system it equals 1 cen-
tipoise; and in the fps system it equals 0.00209 lbf/s/ft.
Relative viscosity of a fluid is defined as the ratio of the absolute viscosity of the fluid to the
absolute viscosity of water, with both the fluid and water at the same temperature and with their
respective viscosity measured in the same units.

Kinematic viscosity relates to the time for a fixed amount of a fluid to flow through a capillary tube
under the force of gravity; it may be defined as the quotient of the absolute viscosity in centipoises
divided by the specific gravity of a fluid, both at the same temperature. The unit of kinematic vis-
cosity is the stoke or centistoke (0.01 stoke), derived as follows: 
(6.3.3)
The viscosity of all liquids decreases with increasing temperature and ASTM viscosity determina-
tions are made at oil temperatures of 37.8°, 50.0°, 54.4° and 99.2°C (100°, 122°, 130° and 210°F,
respectively), and are often expressed as Saybolt Universal at 37.8°C (100°F) or Saybolt Furol at
50°C (122°F). The terms “Saybolt Universal” and “Saybolt Furol” represent the type of instrument
used in making the viscosity determinations. Viscosity measurements made by either method may
be converted by the use of tables.
Reid Vapor Pressure is a test for the vapor pressure of gasoline at 37.8°C (100°F). It shows the ten-
dency of gasoline to generate vapor bubbles and is expressed in SI in kiloPascals, in the cgs sys-
tem in kilograms per square centimetre, and in the fps system in pounds per square inch absolute.
Octane number is the anti-knock rating of gasoline. The rating is made by matching the fuel in a
test engine with a mixture of normal heptane, which detonates very easily and has an octane rat-
ing of zero, and iso-octane, which has exceptionally high anti-knock characteristics and is rated at
100. A fuel knock that matches a mixture of say 60% octane and 40% heptane would have an
octane rating or number of 60. Cetane number is used to show the ignition quality of diesel oils.
The rating is based on a scale resembling those of octane numbers by matching the ignition delay
of the fuel against blends of cetane, a fast-burning paraffin, and methyl naphthalene, a slow-burn-
ing aromatic material.
The ASTM has developed a table for grading fuel oils, consisting of six grades. According to this
classification, heating oils generally used for domestic and small industrial heating furnaces com-
prise Grades 1, 2 and 3. Grades 5 and 6, formerly known as Bunker B and Bunker C fuel oils,
respectively, are used extensively in the steel industry. Grade 5 fuel oil is usually cracking-still tar
and Grade 6 fuel oil, a straight-run or cracked residual, or a mixture of residual and cracking-still
tar blended to reduce the viscosity as required by the consumer.
All grades of fuel oil are normally sold to meet specifications mutually satisfactory to buyer and
seller. A typical specification of Grade 6 fuel oil is given in Table 6.17. Some purchasers may also
specify the desired calorific value of Grade 6 fuel oil (for example, 41,805 kilojoules per cubic
decimetre or 150,000 Btu per gallon, minimum) and the fire point of the oil (for example, 205°C
(400°F) minimum and 232°C (450°F) maximum).

The yield of tar produced in byproduct coke ovens by high-temperature distillation between 1000°
and 1100°C (1832° and 2012°F) differs within very wide limits according to the kind of bitumi-
nous coal coked, and to the temperature, coking time, and design of oven employed in the process.
Virgin tar as produced in the byproduct ovens consists essentially of tar acids, neutral oils which
are principally aromatic hydrocarbons, and a residue pitch.
The residue pitch from the distillation of tar is highly viscous or brittle. Pitch contains a substan-
tial percentage of free carbon and some high-boiling and complex organic chemicals. The compo-
sition and properties of a typical pitch-tar mix and Grade 6 fuel oil are shown in Table 6.18.

6.3.4 Combustion of Liquid Fuels
The combustion of liquid fuel usually is obtained by atomizing the fuel. Atomization breaks up the
fuel into fine, mist-like globules, thus permitting an increased area for intimate contact between
the air supplied for combustion and the fuel. The chemistry of combustion of liquid fuels is com-
plex. The small particles of fuel either vaporize to form gaseous hydrocarbons which burn to CO2
and H2O through a chain of reactions, or the fuel cracks to form carbon (soot) and hydrogen which
also burn with complete combustion to CO2 and H2O. Both of these conditions normally occur in
the combustion of liquid fuels. The first condition predominates with good atomization and proper
mixing with sufficient air. A deficiency of air or poor atomization will cause smoke. For large fur-
naces the atomizing agent is usually steam at a pressure anywhere between 415 and 860 kPa 
(60 and 125 pounds per square inch) gauge. The steam consumed in atomization varies from 0.3
to 0.7 kilograms per kilogram of fuel. When liquid fuels are used in smaller furnaces, atomization
usually is achieved by compressed air or by mechanical action. The character of a liquid-fuel flame,
that is, its shape, size and luminosity, may be altered with a fixed burner design by changing the
degree of atomization which is controlled by the steam pressure. Liquid fuels normally are burned
in steel plants to produce a highly luminous flame at an intensity of flame propagation intermedi-
ate between that generally secured with coke-oven gas and that with natural gas.
Liquid fuels are often preferred because they permit better control of flame direction and, because
of their high calorific value, control of flame temperature and luminosity.
The amount of air required to burn liquid fuels depends upon the chemical composition of the par-
ticular fuel. Grade 6 fuel oil requires approximately 10.64 m3 per kilogram (180 ft3 per lbm) of dry
air for perfect combustion, and tar-pitch approximately 9.34 m3 (158 ft3). From the ultimate analy-
sis of a liquid fuel, the theoretical air requirements and products of combustion may be calculated,
as explained in Section 6.1.2.5.
6.3.5 Liquid-Fuel Burners
There are many different designs of burners for liquid fuels. Burners designed for atomization by
steam or air may be classified into two general types, the inside mixing and the outside mixing. In
the inside-mixing type the fuel and atomizing agent are mixed inside the burner or burner system,
while in the outside-mixing type the two fluids meet immediately outside the burner tip. In large
reheating furnaces the inside-mixing type is used. The inside-mixing type is sometimes classified
as an emulsion type or a nozzle-mix type of burner. In the emulsion type the mixing is performed
at a point several feet from the burner tip, while in the nozzle-mix type the two fluids meet inside
the burner but very close to the burner tip. In the latter type, mixing probably takes place both
inside the burner and as the stream enters the furnace. Liquid-fuel burners used in reheating, forge
and annealing furnaces seldom require water cooling.
The handling of liquid fuels at consuming plants requires a system for their transportation, storage
and conditioning. Where liquid fuels are received by tank car, a system of receiving basins, unload-
ing pumps, strainers and storage tanks generally is required. The storage tanks must be of ample
size to meet fuel demands between deliveries and should be provided with heaters to maintain
proper fluidity for flow through pipelines to the system pressure pumps. Pressure pumps are used
to deliver the liquid fuel through a pipe system to the point of consumption. Where there are a num-
ber of consuming units being served from a common fuel-storage system, the pipe feeder line is
designed in the form of a loop through which the fuel flows at constant pressure and temperature.
The various units tap into this loop. The fuel-oil lines are lagged and provided with tracer steam
lines to maintain uniform fluidity throughout the system and to provide fuel at the burners at the
proper viscosity for atomization. The temperature at which liquid fuel is delivered to the burners
varies with the character of the fuel and burner design. Where pitch is used, a temperature as high
as 150°C (approximately 300°F) in the lines is sometimes required. A temperature level usually
somewhere between 95° and 120°C (approximately 200° and 250°F) is maintained for pitch-tar
mixtures, and 65° and 95°C (approximately 150° and 200°F) for Grade 6 fuel oil. Additional

6.4 Gaseous Fuels and Their Utilization
The availability of natural gas in so many sections of this country has had a profound influence
upon our industrial progress. It was first used as an illuminating gas at Fredonia, New York, in
1821. The discovery of new fields and the installation of pipelines to consuming centers led to
increasing demands, as the convenience, cleanliness, and general utility of this form of fuel became
better known. The initial use of natural gas for steel manufacture was at a rolling mill plant at
Leechburg, Pa., in 1874. A well in this area permitted exclusive use of natural gas for puddling,
heating, and steam generation for a period of six months. Since 1932 there has been an accelerated
demand for natural gas, which peaked in 1972 at 0.626 trillion cubic metres (22.10 trillion cubic
feet). The rapid price escalation which followed the oil shocks cut demand by 1986 to less than
75% of the previous peaks. As supplies have increased and prices have fallen, the consumption of
natural gas has returned to 0.587 trillion cubic metres (20.73 trillion cubic feet) in 1994.
Deregulation of the gas industry has been the main contributing factor in the resurgence of gas as
the fuel of choice in the U.S.
Many industrial and some commercial gas users purchase their own gas from suppliers in the Gulf
of Mexico and Southwestern states, arrange for transportation on the interstate pipeline system and
if necessary pay the local utility to move the gas into the plant. In some cases, industrial users have
bypassed the local utility completely and have built short pipelines from the interstate pipeline to
their plant. End users have many options available to them with regards to the quality of service
required. For example, a company could request firm or interruptible transportation services from
the interstate and/or sign up for storage capacity with the local distribution company to hedge
against winter curtailments on the interstate system.
As with oil, the U.S. natural gas reserves are shrinking while the worldwide reserves have risen
substantially. For example, over the past two decades, U.S. natural reserves have fallen 30% to
4,599 billion cubic metres (162,415 billion cubic feet) and the world natural gas reserves have nearly
doubled to 141,024 billion cubic metres (4,980,278 billion cubic feet). The majority of the world
increase has come from the Middle East and the CIS (former Soviet Union Republics). The predom-
inant domestic supply sources are the Gulf of Mexico, Southwestern states and Western Canada.
Producer gas was the first gaseous fuel successfully utilized by the iron and steel industry. This gas
permitted the early experimentation in regeneration, and the utilization of this principle started a
new era of steel manufacturing. The advantages of preheated gas and air were so clearly indicated
in 1861 that producer gas rapidly became the major fuel utilized by open-hearth furnaces and main-
tained its position for almost sixty years, or until about 1920, when byproduct coke plants, sup-
plying coke-oven gas and tar, began to challenge this leadership.
Blast-furnace gas utilization by the iron and steel industry probably should rank first historically,
although its adoption by the industry was slower than in the case of producer gas. The sensible heat
in the blast-furnace top gases was first utilized in 1832 to transfer heat to the cold blast. Originally,
this heat exchanger was mounted on the furnace top. In 1845, the first attempts were made to make
use of its heat of combustion, but history indicates that the burning of blast-furnace gas was not
successful until 1857. It is probable that progress in the utilization of blast-furnace gas was delayed
by its dust content, the problems of cleaning and handling, and the low cost of solid fuel. Increasing
cost of other fuels and competition forced its use, and by the turn of this century, blast-furnace gas
had become one of the major fuels of the iron and steel industry. In 1995, the steel industry used
approximately 18 billion cubic metres (651 billion cubic feet) of blast-furnace gas (based on 3,535
kJ/m3 or 90 Btu/ft3) for blast-furnace stove heating, coke-oven underfiring, the raising of steam in
boilers and heating steel in various types of furnaces. This quantity of blast-furnace gas would, in
joules (Btu’s), equal 1.6 billion cubic metres (57 billion cubic feet) of natural gas.

The initial use of byproduct coke-oven gas in the iron and steel industry was at the Cambria Steel
Company, Johnstown, Pa., in 1894. This installation was followed by only a few byproduct coke-
plant additions until a shortage of transportation facilities and the rising price of coal and natural
gas during the first World War accelerated installations throughout the steel industry. The utiliza-
tion of coke-oven gas has been very profitable as it reduced the purchase of outside fuels. It is esti-
mated that plants operating steelmaking furnaces in the U.S. used approximately 11,794 million
cubic metres (28,052 million cubic feet) of coke-oven gas as fuel in 1995 (based on 19,640 kJ/m3
or 500 Btu/ft3). This is only a small fraction of the quantities used as recently as 1982.
The gas produced by the basic oxygen process has not been utilized by the U.S. steel industry due
to the cost of the equipment required to gather and clean the gas versus the cost of alternative fuels.
In Europe and Japan, where substitute fuels are more expensive, BOF gas has been collected and
utilized by many of the steel works for a number of years. Approximately 0.70 GJ/tonne (0.60 mil-
lion Btu/ton) of offgas can be collected from each heat in a BOF with a typical size of 181 tonne
(200 ton). The recovered gas has a calorific value of 8837 kJ/m3 (225 Btu/ft3).
6.4.1 Natural Gas
Natural gas and petroleum are related closely to each other in their chemical composition and in
geographical distribution. Both are made up predominantly of hydrocarbons. Petroleum rarely is
free of natural gas, and the same fields usually produce both fuels. When natural gas exists indige-
nous to an oil stratum and its production is incidental to that of oil, it is called casinghead gas. Gas
found in a field is usually under pressure which diminishes with extended use or, sometimes, from
the presence of too many other wells. The life of a well varies from a few months to twenty years.
Rocks bearing gas are sandstones, limestones, conglomerates, and shales, never igneous rocks.
Natural gas is derived from the remains of marine animal and plant life—in theory, the same as
described previously for petroleum.
Natural gas, as found, is usually of singular purity and is composed principally of the lower gaseous
hydrocarbons of the paraffin series, methane and ethane, some of the heavier liquefiable hydro-
carbons (which are recovered as casinghead gasoline or sold in bottled form as butane, propane,
pentane, etc.) and a small amount of nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Some natural gases contain small
quantities of helium. Occasionally, wells are found in which the gas contains hydrogen sulfide and
organic sulfur vapors. Sour gas is defined as a natural gas which contains in excess of 0.0343
grams of hydrogen sulfide or 0.686 grams of total sulfur per cubic metre, equivalent to 11/2 grains
of hydrogen sulfide or 30 grains of total sulfur per 100 cubic feet. It is fortunate, however, that by
far the greater part of natural gas available in this country is practically sulfur-free.
The principal constituent of natural gas is methane, CH4. Because natural gas contains from 60 to
100% CH4 by volume, the characteristics of methane gas, which were shown in Section 6.1, largely
dominate the parent gas. Comparing methane with the other principal combustible gases, it will be
noted that it has a low rate of flame propagation, a high ignition temperature, and a narrow explo-
sive range. Methane, as well as all other hydrocarbons (of which it is the lowest member), burns
with a luminous flame. Typical compositions of natural gas are presented in Table 6.20.
The iron and steel industry consumed a total of 7,892 million cubic metres (278,711 million cubic
feet) of natural gas in 1995 in blast furnaces and other uses in the blast-furnace area, steel-melting
furnaces, heating and annealing furnaces, heating ovens for wire rods, and other uses.
6.4.2 Manufactured Gases
The four most important of the commercially used manufactured gases are producer gas, water gas,
oil gas, and liquefied petroleum gases. Because none of these gases except liquefied petroleum
gases are used presently in steel manufacturing or processing in the U.S., only a brief description
of their manufacture and characteristics will be given here.

6.4.2.1 Manufacture of Producer Gas
Producer gas is manufactured by blowing an insufficient supply of air for complete combustion,
with or without the admixture of steam, through a thick, hot, solid-fuel bed. A large proportion of
the original heating value of the solid fuel is recovered in the potential heat of carbon monoxide,
hydrogen, tarry vapors, and some hydrocarbons, and in the sensible heat of the composite gas
which also contains carbon dioxide and nitrogen. When the gas is cleaned, the sensible heat of the
gases and the potential heat of the tar vapors is lost.
Table 6.21 gives the composition of clean producer gas made from various fuels in a well-operated
updraft producer.
The gross heating value of raw producer gas, including tar, made from a high-volatile coal, 8% ash,
is about 6678 to 7463 kilojoules per cubic metre (170 to 190 Btu per cubic foot).
Producer gas has a very low rate of flame propagation due to the relatively large amount of inert
gases, N2 and CO2, it contains. The hot gas, containing tar, burns with a luminous flame; the cold
gas is only slightly luminous, while it is non-luminous if made from anthracite coal or coke.
Producer gas is a relatively heavy gas and has a wide explosive range. The theoretical flame tem-
perature is low, approximately 1750°C (3180°F), and the gas generally was preheated when utilized
in steel plant processes.
6.4.2.2 Manufacture of Water Gas
Water gas or blue gas is generated by blowing steam through an incandescent bed of carbon. The
gas-forming reactions are primarily:
C + H2O 5 CO + H2
(6.4.1)
C + 2H2O 5 CO2 + 2H2

Fuel oil may be cracked in a separate heating chamber to form gases that are added to water gas to
enrich it when carburetted water gas is made.
While coke generally is used as the fuel in the production of water gas because of its high carbon
content and cleanliness, anthracite and bituminous coal and mixtures of coal and coke also have
been used successfully, but with some sacrifice in overall operating efficiency. 
Water gas burns with a clear blue flame; hence, the name blue gas. It is used in a number of chem-
ical processes to supply a basic gas for synthetic processes, but it is not suitable for distribution as
a domestic fuel unless it has been enriched with cracked fuel oil, when it is called carburetted water
gas.
Water gas made from coke burns with a nonluminous flame. Carburetted water gas burns with a
highly luminous flame. Both gases have a high rate of flame propagation. The speed of combus-
tion for water gas exceeds that of any other extensively used fuel gas; that for carburetted water gas
is practically the same as for coke-oven gas. Water gas has a slightly lower specific gravity than
natural gas, but is somewhat heavier than coke-oven gas. Carburetted water gas is heavier than nat-
ural gas but lighter than producer gas. The theoretical flame temperature of both blue and carbu-
retted water gas is very high, approximately 2020°C and 2050°C (3670° and 3725°F), respectively,
exceeding that of all other industrial fuel gases commonly used. Both gases have a relatively wide
explosive range.
6.4.2.3 Oil Gas
Oil gas is a combination of cracked petroleum and water gas made by passing oil and steam
through hot refractory checker work. Oil gas is commercially important in localities where coal or
coke is expensive and oil is cheap.

6.4.2.4 Liquefied Petroleum Gas
Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), sometimes referred to as bottled gases, have become commer-
cially important because of the concentration of fuel energy in liquid form which may be converted
easily into a gas. They are distributed for household use in steel cylinders, called bottles, and in
tank cars or trucks for industrial purposes. They are sometimes sold under various trade names but
are composed mainly of butane, propane, and pentane. A steel cylinder of propane as sold for
domestic purposes contains approximately 50,300 kilojoules per kilogram (21,640 Btu per pound)
of liquid gas. Larger versions of these containers have been used by the steel industry as back up
supply for natural gas systems.
6.4.2.5 Alternative Fuel Sources
Drastic escalation of oil prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in
the 1970s stimulated interest in alternative sources of fuels to supplement existing supplies. A
number of projects began operation during the early 1980s. Tennessee Eastman built a coal gasifi-
cation plant to provide synthetic gas for conversion to chemicals. The Cool Water Project in
California integrated coal gasification with the generation of electricity by a combination of gas
and steam turbines. Union Oil Company began operation of a shale oil facility at Parachute,
Colorado, and a consortium built the Great Plains Coal gasification plant to produce synthetic nat-
ural gas. Companies also started to recover gas from sanitary landfills.
Once oil and gas prices stabilized at more normal levels, many of these projects became uneco-
nomic. Over time, these types of alternative fuel sources may once again become economically
attractive.
6.4.3 Byproduct Gaseous Fuels
The two major byproduct gaseous fuels recovered by the steel works are blast-furnace and coke-
oven gases. A number of other unavoidable gaseous fuels are created by regular manufacturing
processes. Some of these are of minor economic consequence, but the majority are useful and gen-
erally utilized at the plant where they are produced. An exception is oil-refinery gas which is some-
times piped and marketed to industries adjacent to refineries. The calorific value and flame
characteristics of byproduct gases have wide ranges. Blast-furnace gas has probably the lowest heat
content of any, and oil refinery gas the highest, respectively about 3535 and 72,668 kilojoules per
cubic metre (90 and 1850 Btu per cubic foot), although both vary from these values.
6.4.3.1 Blast-Furnace Gas
Blast-furnace gas is a byproduct of the iron blast furnace. The paramount objective in blast-furnace
operation is to produce iron of a specified quality, economically; the fact that usable gas issues
from the top of the furnace is merely a fortunate attendant circumstance. When air enters the tuy-
eres, its oxygen reacts with the coke. The resulting gas passes up through the shaft of the furnace
which has been charged with coke, ore, and limestone, and after a number of chemical reactions
and a travel of some 25 metres (80 feet), issues as a heated, dust-laden, lean, combustible gas. The
annual volume production of this gas is greater than that of any other gaseous fuel. Two and one-
half to three and one-half tons of blast-furnace gas are generated per ton of pig iron produced.
While the purpose of the gases generated by the partial combustion of carbon is to reduce iron ore,
the value of a blast furnace as a gas producer is evident from the relation just noted.
The percentage of CO and CO2 in blast-furnace gas is directly related to the amount of carbon in
the coke and the amount of CO2 in the limestone charged per ton of iron produced. The rate of car-
bon consumption depends principally upon the kind of iron to be made, the physical and chemical
characteristics of the charged material, the distribution of the material in the furnace stack, the fur-
nace lines, and the temperature of the hot blast. The total CO1CO2 content of the top gas is
approximately 40% by volume, and when producing ordinary grades of iron the ratio of CO to CO2
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

will vary from 1.25:1 to 2.5:1. The hydrogen content of the gas varies from 3 to 5% depending on
the type and amount of tuyere-injected fuels. The remaining percentage is made up of nitrogen,
except for approximately 0.2% CH4.
Blast-furnace gas leaves the furnace at a temperature of approximately 120° to 370°C (approxi-
mately 250° to 700°F), and at a pressure of 345 to 1380 mm Hg gauge pressure (15 inches w.g. to
14.5 psig), carrying with it 22 to 114 grams of water vapor per cubic metre (10 to 50 grains per
cubic foot) and 18 to 34 grams of dust per cubic metre (8 to 15 grains per cubic foot). The parti-
cles of dust vary from 6.4 to 0.000254 mm in diameter. In early days of blast-furnace operation,
the gas was used as it came from the furnace without cleaning, causing a great deal of trouble with
flues, combustion chambers, and stoves due to clogging. The gas now is cleaned almost universally,
the degree depending upon the use.
The outstanding characteristics of blast-furnace gas as a fuel are:  (1) very low calorific value—
approximately 2946 to 3535 kilojoules per cubic metre (75 to 90 Btu per cubic foot) depending on
blast-furnace coke rate, (2) low theoretical flame temperature—approximately 1455°C (2650°F),
(3) low rate of flame propagation—relatively lower than any other common gaseous fuel, (4) high
specific gravity—highest of all common gaseous fuels, and (5) burns with a non-luminous flame.
6.4.3.2 Coke-Oven Gas
The steel industry, which uses the majority of the total coke-oven gas generated in the U.S., gen-
erally classifies coke-oven gas as a byproduct of coke manufacture. This undoubtedly is due to the
former waste of coke-oven gas and other coal products for so many years in the beehive coke
process. Actually, the production of coke-oven gas and other coal chemicals is a part of an impor-
tant manufacturing process, in which large sums have been expended for their recovery, as they
have a value almost equal to that of the coke. Coke-oven gas is produced during the carbonization
or destructive distillation of bituminous coal in the absence of air. Approximately 310 cubic metres
of 19,640 kJ/m3 gas are produced per metric ton of coal coked (about 11,000 cubic feet of 500-Btu
gas per net ton of coal coked) in conventional high-temperature coking processes.
The composition of coke-oven gas varies in accordance with the grade and density of coal and
operating practices. Typical percentage ranges for constituents of dry coke-oven gas by volume are
presented in Table 6.22.

Coke-oven gas contains hydrogen sulfide, H2S. Approximately 40% of the sulfur in coal, not
removed in the washing process, is evolved with the distillation products. Much of this remains in
the gas. Carbonization of coals containing 1.20% sulfur evolves a gas containing approximately 9.7
grams of sulfur per cubic metre (424 grains per 100 cubic feet), and those containing 1.60% sul-
fur approximately 14 grams of sulfur per cubic metre (600 grains per 100 cubic feet). Commercial
coals in the eastern part of the U.S. usually run from 0.5 to 1.5% sulfur. Gases high in sulfur con-
tent are very undesirable for metallurgical purposes.
Coke-oven gas normally is saturated with water vapor. In distribution systems, means must be pro-
vided for draining off the condensation due to any temperature change.
Coke-oven gas burns with a non-luminous to semi-luminous flame, depending upon the degree of
mixing air and gas. Its rate of flame propagation is high, considerably higher than natural, pro-
ducer, or blast-furnace gas. It has a low specific gravity, in fact the lowest of any of the gaseous
fuels commonly utilized by the steel industry. It has a high theoretical flame, approximately
1980°C (3600°F), which is a little higher than that of natural gas. The explosive range is roughly
twice that of natural gas.
6.4.3.3 Basic Oxygen Furnace Gas
One fuel that has not been economically recovered by the domestic steel industry is basic oxygen
furnace gas. The utilization of this fuel requires special collection and cleaning equipment which
would allow for its use in the steel plant. The special equipment includes such items as an
adjustable skirt on the vessel hood, a flare, a gas holder, by-pass valving and a wet electrical pre-
cipitator. BOF gas of sufficient quality to be used is collected only during part of the blowing cycle.
For example, the start of gas recovery begins when the CO content is above 30% and the O2 con-
tent falls below 2%. The stoppage of gas recovery occurs when the O2 content is above 2% or the
CO content falls below 30%. These parameters may vary from plant to plant. The composition of
the gas varies throughout the blow but a typical analysis ( by volume) is as follows: 57% CO, 26%
CO2, 2% H2O, 15% N2, and O2 <1% (most of the cycle).
In steel plants in other countries which utilize BOF gas, the most predominate use is in the boiler
plant, either directly or blended with blast-furnace gas. More recently, BOF gas has also been uti-
lized along with blast-furnace gas in gas turbine combined cycle units, which are much more effi-
cient in producing power than a conventional boiler and steam turbine generator set.

The choice of the most desirable fuel for each of the many facilities in a steel plant is not always
possible, but by judicious planning the most efficient fuel or combination can be selected from
those available. The general characteristics of each gas govern, wherever possible, its selection for
a specific purpose in a steel plant. An outline of the important applications of the major gaseous
fuels follows.
6.4.4.1 Use of Blast-Furnace Gas
For many years the use of blast-furnace gas for purposes other than for the firing of stoves and boil-
ers was not economical. A number of factors have contributed, however, to the enlarged use of
blast-furnace gas, the more important of which are:  (1) rising cost of purchased fuel; (2) technical
progress in gas cleaning, in the use of regeneration and recuperation, and in the mixing of gaseous
fuels; (3) the economic advantage of using pulverized coal in boiler houses to substitute for blast-
furnace gas, thereby permitting its substitution elsewhere for the more expensive liquid and
gaseous fuels; and (4) seasonal shortages in the availability of purchased liquid and gaseous fuels.
In certain applications, in addition to preheating the air, the gas itself may be preheated to provide
higher temperature potential. For the facilities listed, blast-furnace gas may be utilized successfully
without preheat:  blast furnace stoves, soaking pits, normalizing and annealing furnaces, foundry
core ovens, gas engines for blowing or power generation, gas turbines for power generation, and
boilers.
The thermal advantage of using blast-furnace gas in gas engines for blowing and for electric-power
generation must overcome the heavy investment and maintenance expense of this equipment. The
modern boiler house utilizing high steam pressure and temperature with efficient turbo-blowers
and generators has sufficiently reduced the thermal advantage of gas engines, such that their use is
difficult to justify. Some steel plants in Asia and Europe have been successful in the use of direct-
connected gas turbines for driving generators.
Preheated blast-furnace gas burned with preheated air has been used successfully in coke-oven
heating, soaking pits, and reheating furnaces.
When blast-furnace gas is preheated, it should have a minimum cleanliness of 0.023 grams per
cubic metre (0.01 grains per cubic foot); and in all cases where this gas is used, extra precautions
must be taken to prevent the escape of fuel or unburned gas into attendant surroundings because it
contains a large percentage of toxic CO gas. Blast-furnace gas is used for many applications in the
steel plant and, in addition, is used frequently for heating coke ovens and sometimes is mixed with
other gases as a fuel. In blast furnace operations, where the blast-furnace gas has a heating value
approaching a low value of 2946 kilojoules per cubic metre (75 Btu per cubic foot), it is necessary
to switch the gas with other fuels to obtain very high hot-blast temperature from the stove.
6.4.4.2 Use of Coke-Oven Gas
Coke-oven gas has had a more extended use than blast-furnace gas because of:  (1) relatively low
distribution costs due to its low specific gravity and high calorific value; (2) its ability to develop
extremely high temperatures by combustion; and (3) the high rate at which it can release heat,
thereby eliminating excessively large combustion chambers. The low specific gravity of coke-oven
gas is a disadvantage, and for this reason, it is supplemented wherever possible with a driven
liquid fuel. In addition, the sulfur (in the form of H2S) present in raw (not desulfurized) coke-oven
gas is a distinct disadvantage, particularly in heating certain grades of alloy steel for rolling. Its
presence also requires the use of materials resistant to sulfur attack in pipelines, valves, and
burners.
There are a number of fuel applications in a steel plant where neither blast-furnace gas nor coke-
oven gas, when burned alone, develop the desired flame characteristics or temperature level for
optimum results. By mixing two fuels of such great variance in characteristics, a more ideal fuel
can be obtained for specific applications.

The speed of combustion is very high for coke-oven gas and very low for blast-furnace gas. The
desired speed can be attained through the proper proportioning of the two fuels. The speed also can
be modified to a limited extent when necessary by suitable combustion technique. Mixed blast-fur-
nace and coke-oven gas is particularly suitable for application to soaking pits and reheating fur-
naces.
6.4.4.3 Use of Natural Gas
Due to plant balances requiring the purchase of outside gaseous fuels, mixtures of coke-oven gas
and natural gas are often utilized. While the temperature-developing characteristics of these two
gases are nearly identical, they have differences in other characteristics, notably in the rate of flame
propagation and in luminosity. By proper proportioning, the advantage of a short, intensive cutting
flame or a long, luminous, soft flame may be had to suit the applications. Use of natural gas for
flame cutting and scarfing has been increasing steadily.
6.4.4.4 Use of Producer Gas
Raw, hot, producer gas was used extensively in the past in steel plant operations for open-hearth
furnaces, soaking pits, and reheating furnaces. It was customary to preheat this gas regeneratively
when used in batch-type reheating furnaces. In continuous-type reheating furnaces, the fuel seldom
was preheated. With good gas making, producer gas develops a soft, heavy, long, luminous flame
desirable for reheating steel. The use of this gas has been superseded in all plants by natural gas
and byproduct gaseous and liquid fuels.
6.4.5 Combustion of Various Gaseous Fuels
The major combustion reactions of the components of gaseous fuels with air and a table of essen-
tial gas combustion constants were given in Section 6.1.2.5. From chemical equations, the quan-
tity of air required to provide perfect combustion and the resultant products may be calculated for
any given gaseous fuel. Table 6.23 shows the air requirements, products of combustion, and perti-
nent characteristics of several gaseous fuels. The degree of mixing of air with a gaseous fuel, and
the degree of excess or deficiency of air to the theoretical requirements are pertinent combustion
problems. The degree of mixing is controlled by burner design. Burners have been developed to
produce short, intense flames or long, slow-burning flames. The short, intense flame is usually
nonluminous or semi-luminous, while the long flame is luminous. This relation is not always the
case, however, because a gas must contain hydrocarbons to develop luminosity. Burners capable of
producing short, intense flames will liberate a large amount of heat in a small space. Some gases,
due primarily to the constituents of which they are composed, are capable of a high rate of heat
release; others, of a very low rate of heat release. The two extremes are evident in two common
steel-plant fuels, coke-oven gas and blast-furnace gas, which give high and low rates of heat
release, respectively. There is also a limit to the length of flame which can be produced. It is deter-
mined by the ability of the flame to provide enough heat to propagate itself. If the short, intense-
flame type burner is used with coke-oven or natural gas, combustion will be so intense that no
flame will be visible, and heat can be liberated at rates over 40 million watts per cubic metre per
hour (up to several million Btu per cubic foot per hour) of combustion space; while the long, slow-
burning-flame burner firing the same gases is capable of developing a visible flame 6 to 9 metres
(20 to 30 feet) long with a heat liberation of 155,000 to 210,000 watts per cubic metre (15,500 to
21,000 Btu per cubic foot per hour). Both types of flames are desirable for specific steel plant
applications. It is obvious that burner selection based on degree of mixing is important. Carrying
an excess or deficiency of air for combustion is practiced usually to control scale formation, but
this is done sometimes to control flame characteristics. An excess of air tends to shorten, while a
deficiency lengthens, a flame. An excess of air above theoretical requirements causes higher heat
losses as any extra air absorbs its share of the heat of combustion. Fuels containing hydrogen must
have the exit stack temperature high enough to avoid condensation of water within the furnace sys-
tem and subsequent corrosion of furnace parts. In some cases, it is necessary to burn the fuel with

excess air to maintain the flue gases above their dewpoint. When there is a deficiency of air, poten-
tial heat is lost. In problems of design and fuel conservation, the air requirements and volume and
constituents of the products of combustion must be known to effect a practical solution.
6.5 Fuel Economy
Because fuel represents the largest single item of raw material expense for the manufacture of iron
and steel, the subject of fuel economy is of consequence to both the producer and consumer of steel
products. The world steel industry accounts for nearly 20% of the worldwide total industrial energy
consumption. The efficient utilization of this large quantity of fuel is also pertinent to the conser-
vation of our fuel resources. The history of the steel industry shows great progress has been made
in reducing the amount of fuel required to produce a ton of steel. During the Revolutionary War,
ironmaking required large quantities of charcoal, as the source of carbon, to reduce the ore. If a
substitute had not been found for charcoal, our forests would have disappeared many years ago and
our industrial progress arrested. In the past one hundred years, which really represents the modern
era of steelmaking, a number of important developments have taken place to reduce the fuel
requirements in producing steel. Some of these developments could be listed by historical
sequence, while others are of such a nature that they cannot be designated by any period of time.
The major contributions to fuel economy in ironmaking and steelmaking plants have been:
1. Development of the Bessemer converter.
2. Development of the Siemens-Martin regenerator.
3. Development of the hot blast.
4. Utilization of blast-furnace gas.
5. Installation of byproduct coke plants and utilization of byproduct fuels.
6. Integration of steel plants.
7. Electric drives for rolling mills.
8. Improved efficiency of steam-generating equipment and steam prime movers.
9. Large producing units.
10. Balancing of producing units.
11. Use of raw materials with improved chemical and physical quality.
12. Recovery of waste heat by recuperators, boilers and other forms of heat exchangers.
13. Development and utilization of instruments and control equipment.
14. Insulation of high-temperature facilities.
15. Utilization of the optimum fuel for specific facilities.
16. Improvements in manufacturing technique and production control.
17. More highly skilled operators.
18. Development of oxygen-blown steelmaking processes.
19. Development of continuous casting of steel and, more recently, thin slab casting.
20. Recovery of sensible heat by hot charging and direct rolling.
21. Gas turbine combined-cycle facilities.
The results of the above contributions now have made it possible to produce a ton of raw steel uti-
lizing far less energy than was ever thought possible. The consumption of primary fuels in the iron
and steel industry for 1995 is shown in Table 6.24.

In addition to these outstanding contributions to fuel economy in steel mills, the importance of the
effect that the rate of operations has on fuel economy should be stressed. Historically, the iron and
steel industry follows the general business level maintained in the country, but its rate of opera-
tions often fluctuates more than that of many other industries. During peak production, optimum
fuel economy is the natural result of operating the facilities which require fuel under the conditions
for which they were designed to operate most economically. During periods of low production, fuel
consumption undergoes a severe increase per unit of output; careful scheduling of production and
facilities are required during this period to maintain minimum fuel losses.
The effectiveness with which byproduct fuels are used in steel plants is of major significance in
reducing the quantity of primary or purchased fuel required to produce a ton of steel. The effi-
ciency of heat utilization by steelmaking furnaces is discussed in the chapters dealing with the
design and operation of these units in Chapters 8 and 10.
The heat lost from the combustion of fuel in steel plant metallurgical and service facilities repre-
sents an appreciable part of the total supply. The amount lost differs among the various processes.
In general, those processes having the higher temperature levels have the greatest thermal losses
and, therefore, offer the best opportunity for heat recovery. For a specific facility, the amount and
causes for these losses can be determined quantitatively by conducting a heat balance, and the
results of this heat balance can then be used for planning a program aimed at heat conservation.
Usually, the largest losses are contained in the waste flue gases and in radiation from the furnace
walls. Additional losses are associated with combustion control (providing insufficient air for com-
bustion at the burners and/or inadequate mixing of fuel and air), heating practice and air infiltra-
tion. Most important common denominators underlying all successful programs of heat
conservation are proper maintenance of the facility and its instrumentation and proper scheduling
of operations so that the facility is, as closely as practical, fully utilized for its intended purpose.
6.5.1 Recovery of Waste Heat
The recovery of heat from waste flue gases of high-temperature processes has been practiced for
nearly 100 years. These high-temperature flue gases contain both sensible heat and the latent heat of
vaporization of water and sometimes potential heat (unburned flue gases). The recovery of the heat
of vaporization of water is not practical; however, the recovery of the sensible heat is accomplished

by one or a combination of several methods, including the use of regenerators, recuperators, waste-
heat boilers, or utilization of a furnace design in which the waste heat is used to preheat the product.
Regenerators are used alternately to absorb heat from one fluid and then transfer it to another fluid;
recuperators are used to transfer heat continuously from one fluid to another. The fluids referred to
in these two definitions are:  (1) hot gaseous products of combustion which give up heat during
passage through the regenerator or recuperator and (2) fuel gases or air for combustion which
undergo heating while passing through the regenerator or recuperator. The importance of recuper-
ators or regenerators for preheating the air to be used for combustion is shown in Fig. 6.4. In this
illustration, the amount of fuel saving (in percent) is plotted vertically, and the temperature of the
flue gas at exit is plotted horizontally. The temperature of the preheated air is shown on the curves,
and from these an estimate can be obtained of the amount of fuel saving to be gained from using
preheated air.
Regenerators are applied usually to furnaces which can be fired alternately from the ends, the flow
of gases through the furnace and regenerators being reversed according to predetermined time
and/or temperature cycles. Coke ovens, and many batch-type reheating furnaces and soaking pits,
are equipped with regenerators. Blast-furnace stoves also use the regenerative principle but oper-
ate over a much longer cycle and in a somewhat different manner than that practiced in other instal-
lations. In a blast-furnace stove, checker brick of the regenerator are heated by burning of fuel
exclusively for the purpose of heating the regenerator brick, while in other furnace installations the
checker brick are heated by waste gases. In both cases, the heat stored in the regenerators is used
to preheat air for the combustion of fuel in the furnace they serve.
Recuperators have been applied to many modern batch and continuous-type reheating furnaces,
and to steam boilers. When applied to steam boilers, they commonly are called air preheaters.

Recuperators are of three general types, classified according to the direction of flow of the waste
gases and air, as follows:  counter-flow, parallel or co-current flow, and cross-flow.
Counter-flow is used to attain maximum air-preheat temperatures, and cross-current flow is used
to secure optimum heat-transfer rates (kilojoules per square metre of recuperator surface per
degree Celsius temperature difference per hour, or Btu per square foot of recuperator surface per
degree Fahrenheit temperature difference per hour). Parallel flow is used where it is necessary, such
as in metallic recuperators, to maintain the temperature difference of the division wall between the
two fluids as uniform as possible throughout its length and to keep the temperature of the hot end
below a maximum so that the metallic elements will not be overheated. Generally, a combination
of counter-flow and cross-flow is applied to many steel-mill furnace applications where a refrac-
tory material is used to divide the two fluids. A combination of the two types is accomplished by
baffling the flow of one of the fluids. In such designs, the general direction of flow of fluids
exchanging heat is counter-current and the flow in each baffle is cross-current. When the temper-
ature of waste gas from which heat is to be extracted is relatively low, under 980°C (approximately
1800°F), metallic tubes (e.g., stainless steel) are generally used because they possess an advantage
against leakage. Higher-temperature recuperators are generally constructed of clay or silicon-car-
bide materials; often, however, these recuperators suffer the disadvantage of air leakage.
Waste-heat boilers are used to obtain heat recovery when a practical limit of recovery has been
obtained by regenerators or recuperators and there is still sufficient heat left in the waste gases to
justify expenditures for the waste-heat boilers. Boilers sometimes are used in place of regenerators
or recuperators, depending upon conditions such as where preheated air is undesirable or where the
generation of steam solves the problem of fuel conservation more satisfactorily. Waste-heat boilers
are most applicable to high-temperature, continuous processes and have been used principally in
the steel plant in conjunction with basic oxygen vessels, gas turbines and, to a lesser degree, with
reheating furnaces and soaking pits. Fire-tube and water-tube boiler types have been installed, the
former being the preferred type and generally of horizontal single-pass design. Waste-heat boilers
usually are provided with superheaters and sometimes with economizers.
6.5.2 Minimizing Radiation Losses
Radiation losses from the walls and roofs of the furnaces can be minimized by the selection and
use of an insulating system. Thermal insulating materials have been used in steel plants for a great
many years. There are many different kinds of insulating materials, each being most suitable for a
specific temperature level and for the degree of insulation desired and improvements in insulating
materials are continuing. A detailed discussion of insulating systems for steel-mill furnaces is
given in Section 3.6.3.
6.5.3 Combustion Control
As mentioned previously, one of the large losses in a heating process is the heat contained in the
waste flue gases. The amount of sensible heat in the waste flue gases is the product of the heat con-
tent per unit volume (m3 or ft3) or unit weight (kg or lbm) of gas multiplied by the total volume or
total weight of the gas respectively, in the appropriate units. The total loss of heat in waste flue
gases can be minimized by providing the proper amount of air for combustion. If too much air is
provided, the volume of the waste gases is increased. In addition, an excess of air over that required
for combustion lowers the flame temperature and increases the time necessary to heat the product.
In a similar manner, an excess of fuel (or a deficiency of air) also decreases the flame temperature
and prolongs the heating time and, in addition, results in unburned fuel being carried into the waste
flue gases. This results in unnecessary usage of fuel and can be dangerous because this unburned
fuel can burn in the flue and cause damage to the stack and/or waste heat recovery systems. In other
words, fuel economy is optimized by the use of proper combustion conditions.
In modern steel plant furnaces, and in boilers, the amount of air supplied for combustion is main-
tained only a little above theoretical requirements by special pressure regulators and valves which

accurately proportion the amounts of fuel and air fed to the burners. For most burners, an amount
of air approximately 10% above theoretical is considered to be optimum. The use of instruments
to continuously monitor the products of combustion and automatically control the air-fuel ratio to
achieve this desired level of excess air has led to improved fuel economy and heating efficiency.
The amount of waste flue gases can be minimized, and the heating rate of the unit can be increased,
by the oxygen enrichment of combustion air. Air is composed of only approximately 20.9% oxy-
gen (by volume), with the remainder consisting of inert nitrogen plus a small amount of several
other inert gases. When combustion takes place, the oxygen combines with the carbon and hydro-
gen of the fuel and liberates heat. The inert gases of the air absorb heat from the combustion and
carry it out of the furnace, and it is lost so far as the furnace process is concerned. These gases
reduce flame temperature by absorbing heat, thus reducing the rate of transfer of heat to the work.
Obviously, if the inert content of the air could be diminished, more efficient combustion could be
obtained. Recent technical developments that have lowered the cost for producing oxygen of com-
mercial purity have made large-scale use of this gas economical for some industrial processes.
Consequently, many plants have experimented with the addition of oxygen to ordinary air used for
combustion, with generally good results. In effect, increasing the oxygen content lowers the inert
content of the air; consequently, when a given amount of fuel is burned with oxygen-enriched air,
the volume of the waste gas is less than if ordinary air were used. If the temperature of the waste
gas is not increased, the sensible-heat loss in the flue gas will be decreased, due to the smaller heat
capacity of the smaller volume. In furnaces operated at high thermal head, a decrease in the amount
of the inert gases usually results in a decrease in the waste-gas temperature. With the same fuel
input, enriched air for combustion raises the flame temperature of a given fuel, thereby improving
heat-transfer rate and increasing production; alternatively, the fuel input may be decreased when
enriched air is used to maintain the same production rate as obtained with fuel using ordinary air.
Increased production rates almost always reduce the heat losses per ton of product in any furnace
employing a high thermal head.
6.5.4 Air Infiltration
If the pressure of the gases in the heating chamber of the furnace is below atmospheric, cold out-
side air will be drawn into the furnace through any openings that exist. If the interior pressure is
above that of the outside air, the hot gases will be forced out of the furnace through these same
openings, and if too much higher will, in addition, tend to penetrate the refractories and overheat
the furnace bindings with, in some cases, damaging effect. Generally, it is desirable to operate a
furnace with a slight positive pressure in the heating chamber (i.e., furnace pressure slightly higher
than atmospheric). It should be noted that the pressure from top to bottom of the heating chamber
is not uniform, due to the stack effect of the hot gases. Control, therefore, is aimed at maintaining
the desired pressure at the hearth level. Air drawn into a furnace operating under negative pressure
upsets the fuel-air ratio which is controlled automatically or by valve settings. In some units such
as reheating or heat-treating furnaces, this air aggravates the problem of oxidation (or scaling) of
the work because of the ingressed oxygen.
If the pressure in the furnace at the hearth level is equal to atmospheric or slightly positive, better
heating conditions are obtained. This is especially so in furnaces where most of the heating of the
work takes place through heat transfer by radiation from the flame to the bath or work. The posi-
tive pressure must be controlled to prevent excessive sting-out of flame from furnace openings (a
small pressure imparts a high velocity to hot gases), as well as to avoid the buildup of excessive
back pressure that would interfere with proper flow of fuel (if gaseous) and combustion air. Positive
pressures maintained at hearth level in practical work are quite low, ranging only up to approxi-
mately one millimetre (a few hundredths of an inch) of water. Furnace pressure is controlled by
adjusting the opening in the stack damper.
Positioning of the damper can be done manually, using the flame sting-out as an indication of the
existence of positive pressure, but it is difficult to adjust the opening for the frequent changes in

furnace conditions. The development, about the year 1928, of industrial-type instruments with suf-
ficient sensitivity to measure differential gas pressures with an accuracy of 60.06 mm (0.0025
inch) of water made possible the use of automatic control of furnace pressure.
Automatic furnace-pressure control has been provided for a majority of steel plant furnaces and
has been a principal factor in the improvements in fuel economy and efficiency of melting and
reheating furnaces during the years following its adoption.
6.5.5 Heating Practice
The primary objective of any furnace operation is to heat the product (steel, as in the case of most
furnaces, or air as in the case of blast-furnace stoves) to the desired temperature at the desired heat-
ing rate. The actual practice used to achieve the desired temperature and the desired rate will vary
with each specific installation, and in each installation will vary with the level of operation.
Consequently, it is beyond the scope of this discussion to provide such specific details. However,
several general principles apply to all facilities.
The use of excessive amounts of fuel (high heating rate) is wasteful of the fuel itself and results in
high furnace exit-gas temperatures and damage to refractories. In some processes, high fuel rates
not only do not hasten transfer of heat to the material being processed, but also may cause it actual
damage. On the other hand, the use of insufficient fuel reduces the rate of heat transfer and pro-
longs process time, thereby increasing thermal losses. The optimum rate for protection either of the
material being heated or the furnace refractories, and often for control of heating or production
rate, is maintained in most furnaces by automatic temperature-measuring instruments which con-
trol the fuel rate through a system of electrical relays or other units which control the operation of
motors, hydraulic systems or other means for regulating fuel valves. Many heating installations
have adopted computerized control for the heating operations.
A basic requirement for all heating operations is good temperature measurement. One problem
involved in temperature measurement is the difficulty and almost impossibility of measuring the
temperature inside a solid piece of steel, and in most cases the difficulty is encountered in mea-
suring the surface temperature in one spot. Because of this inability to measure the temperature of
solid steel directly, measurement is made of some other temperature that is closely related to the
steel temperature. Depending upon the specific furnace installation, this involves measuring the
temperature of the roof or wall of the furnace or a measurement of the temperature of the gases in
the furnace. These measurements are achieved in the steel industry by instruments operating on
four main principles:  (1) by measuring the intensity of radiation emitted by the hot furnace or
object being heated, (2) by measuring the minute electrical current generated in a circuit composed
of two wires of dissimilar metals, joined end to end, when one of the joints is heated (this is the
principle of the thermocouple), (3) by measuring the change in the electrical resistance of conduc-
tors when heated to the temperature in question, and (4) by measuring the change in the ratio of
two separate wavelengths of radiation emitted from the hot object or furnace.
6.6 Water Requirements for Steelmaking
6.6.1 General Uses of Water in Steelmaking
Water is such a common substance and generally has been so abundant that its importance to the
iron and steelmaking processes is seldom emphasized in the discussion of operations and metal-
lurgical problems. Without water, steel could not be made. Because early steel mills were built
adjacent to ample sources of fresh water, the availability and quality of water was taken for granted.
Today, greater attention is given to the management of available water resources in the steel mill
environment, particularly in terms of water quality, quantity, and how it is used.
Water is used for direct contact cooling and cleaning of the steel in process, for cooling the process
offgases, for product rinsing, and for process solution makeup; however, the vast majority of the
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

water used in steel making is for non-contact cooling of associated processing equipment. Water is
also used for steam and power generation, potable uses, and dust and moisture control.
Several factors make water a versatile material. It is normally plentiful, readily available, and inex-
pensive. It is easily handled. It can carry large amounts of heat per unit volume (high specific heat).
It neither expands nor compresses significantly within ambient temperature ranges. It does not
decompose. It can dissolve, entrain, suspend, and subsequently transport other material.
The overall use of water in the steel industry has been reduced since the 1970s as a result of mod-
ernization, more continuous processes, and greater reuse (recycle) of the available water supplies.
This reduction has been the result of the more efficient use of existing water supplies and compli-
ance with environmental regulations governing the quantity and quality of water discharged from
the plants.
6.6.1.1 Raw Water Sources
Water can be generally classified as:  seawater, with a total dissolved solids (TDS) or salt content
of more than 3.5% (35,000 ppm); brackish water, with dissolved solids between 1500 and 35,000
ppm; and fresh water, with a dissolved solids content less than 1500 ppm. While some facilities are
located adjacent to oceans, bays or other sources of high salinity waters, fresh water is the over-
whelming preference and source of water consumed and utilized in steel mills.
Fresh water can be further classified into surface water and ground water. All fresh water originates
as rainfall in the continuous cycle of atmospheric evaporation and condensation. Once fallen, the
water either collects on the surface in streams, lakes, and rivers, or seeps into the earth’s crust.
Ground water is ‘old’water originated from wells and springs. Depending on the size of the aquifer
being used, ground water will most likely be the most consistent in terms of temperature and chem-
ical content. Water chemistry can also vary relative to the depth and extraction point of the well.
As compared to surface waters, good clarity, higher TDS, and low total suspended solids (TSS) levels
would be characteristics of ground water because it has flowed through miles of porous rock strata
prior to extraction.
Ground water quality is a function of the geological characteristics of the area. The chemical con-
tent will vary, depending on the rock strata through which the water has percolated. Water flow
through the strata is usually slow, measured in feet per year. Seasonal changes will typically be
minimal. Over time, the chemical content may change, particularly if large quantities are extracted,
reflecting ground water migration in the aquifer.
Surface water is typically obtained from shallow wells, rivers, and large lakes or reservoirs.
Compared to ground water, surface water in general will have higher suspended solids and lower
dissolved solids, depending on rainfall in the area being drained. Quality may vary seasonally,
depending on local rainfall patterns, as dilution affects constituent concentrations. In addition,
water quality can be affected by upstream use and sources, including farm runoff, mine drainage,
treatment plants, and practices such as road salt application. In larger water bodies, such as the
Great Lakes, observable change may be minimal because of the volume of water contained and its
turnover rate. Table 6.25 lists typical makeup water chemistries from various sources, by geography.
6.6.1.2 Cooling Water and Other Applications
Water usage in the steelmaking process can be generally classified as either non-contact or contact
water. Non-contact application is the use of water for general cooling purposes where only equip-
ment is being cooled and the water does not contact the steel in process, offgases or fluids. Contact
water includes all applications of water directly on the steel in process, process gas cleaning appli-
cations, process fluid applications (oils, cleaners, etc.) and rinse applications. Contact waters are
subject to treatment, as discussed in Section 6.6.4.
Other applications include steam generation, process solutions makeup, dust control, and potable
systems. Each of these uses is discussed below.

6.6.1.2.1 Steam Generation
Prior to steam generation in a boiler, most raw waters must be pretreated
to meet the water quality requirements set by the boiler manufacturer. Such treatment typically
involves filtration, hardness removal (softening) and/or silica reduction, deaeration, and pH/alka-
linity adjustment. If improperly conditioned, water-related problems, including mineral precipita-
tion and corrosion, can result in permanent damage to the steam generating unit along with energy
inefficient operation.
Higher-pressure power boilers are used in most integrated mills and coke plants to provide the
energy source for blowers to the ironmaking facilities, and to generate electrical power. Waste heat
recovery boilers (steaming BOF hoods, slab reheat furnaces, etc.) are sometimes utilized to pro-
vide additional steam to plant systems, while doubling as the heat removal equipment for the spe-
cific process. Smaller capacity and lower pressure satellite or package boilers will typically
generate steam for specific user requirements (vacuum degassing, acid heating, etc.). In all cases,
recovery of uncontaminated condensed steam can improve operational economics and reduce
makeup water requirements.
6.6.1.2.2 Process Solutions
Pickling, cleaning, and coating operations typically performed in the
finishing mills utilize water as the diluent for inhibitors, lubricants or plating solutions prior to
their application to the steel in-process. Once applied, excess material is recaptured, or transferred
to a suitable waste treatment facility prior to discharge, or sent offsite (spent acids) for disposal or
reuse. Water that meets the necessary quality requirements for rinse applications is used to remove
the residue of process chemicals from the surface of the steel. These rinse waters are normally
treated in a wastewater treatment facility.
6.6.1.2.3 Raw Materials Preparation
The principal raw materials are coal (most of which is con-
verted to coke), iron-bearing materials (natural lump ore, iron pellets, recycled agglomerates, and
more recently iron carbide and DRI), and fluxes (lime, limestone, and dolomite). In coal prepara-
tion, considerable quantities of water are used for dust control in the mines and in coal preparation
(washing) facilities for foreign matter removal. Similarly, large amounts of water are used in the
beneficiation of iron ores to remove foreign matter and concentrate the iron content. Water may
also be added in the forming operation (balling mill) to facilitate agglomeration.
In primary facilities, water may be used for dust suppression to meet plant air emissions require-
ments with or without the use of dust suppressants for roads, conveyor transfer points, and storage

piles. In pulverized coal injection (PCI) for blast furnaces, moisture content is monitored and addi-
tions may be made.
6.6.1.2.4 Potable Systems  These systems provide the drinking and convenience water for human con-
sumption. Primary concerns are for heavy metal content, water clarity, selected organic com-
pounds, and the absence of biological activity. Except in remote plant sites, both potable supplies
and sanitary wastewater treatment are normally provided by municipal systems.
6.6.2 Water-Related Problems
Some of the properties of water that make it useful for so many purposes can also contribute to the
creation of problems in its use. Water’s ability to dissolve, entrain, and suspend solids, liquids, or
gases can affect the purity of the water being used and can subsequently affect piping, equipment,
and the process. Contamination of the water can subsequently limit its use in many instances until
suitable treatment can remove or modify the concentration of offending constituents.
Water-related problems can be generally classified in four different categories:  corrosion, scaling,
fouling, or biological activity.
6.6.2.1 Corrosion
Corrosion is an electrochemical process by which a base metal reverts to its oxide form. Corrosion
can be of a general nature, localized (pitting), or galvanic. For corrosion to occur, a corrosion cell,
consisting of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte, must be present. Water is an excellent elec-
trolyte. The most common evidence of corrosion is the visible loss of base metal in piping and wet-
ted equipment, and the presence of the resultant oxide (rust). Impurities in the water can affect the
rate of metal loss.
Specific mechanisms can be responsible for the metal loss or failure. Galvanic corrosion occurs
when two dissimilar metals are in contact in an aqueous environment, resulting in loss of the anodic
metal; this can occur on a macro or micro level. Beneath deposition, concentration cell corrosion
can be established via various mechanisms, resulting in potentially aggressive localized attack (pit-
ting). Stress corrosion cracking can occur when metal is subjected to tensile stress in a corrosive
environment. Fatigue corrosion occurs in an acidic environment when the metal is subjected to
cyclic application of stress. Impingement or erosion/corrosion attack occurs when entrained solids
or gases repeatedly wear the affected metal due to physical/chemical mechanisms.
6.6.2.2 Scaling
Scaling is a chemical process by which certain minerals become insoluble, precipitate from the
solution, and deposit onto equipment surfaces. Scaling is most commonly associated with salts of
calcium and magnesium. Common to both of these elements is their inverse solubility in water rel-
ative to temperature; as the localized water temperature rises, the solubility of these species drops.
The solubility of these minerals is greatly dependent on their relative concentrations, water tem-
perature, pH, alkalinity, types of anions present, and other water parameters. Should localized boil-
ing to dryness occur, elements including normally soluble ions such as sodium may also precipitate
out. The most common evidence of scale formation is the growth of mineral deposition in piping
and heat transfer surfaces.
6.6.2.3 Fouling
Fouling is the deposition of suspended material in the water, originating from internal or external
sources. The most common evidence of fouling is the accumulation of foulants in low-flow areas
and in flow channel restrictions. Foulants can include items such as insects, mollusks, silt, rust, oils
and greases, scale formed in other areas, and other miscellaneous debris. The presence of soft films
(i.e., oils/greases/biological masses) can facilitate the growth of deposition by capturing normally
suspended material and forming a fouling matrix of material.

6.6.2.4 Biological Activity
The aqueous nature of a cooling water system
can provide an extremely favorable environment
for microorganisms to grow and rapidly repro-
duce. These organisms include algae, fungi, and
different classifications of bacteria: aerobic,
anaerobic, and iron depositing. The most com-
mon evidence is the accumulation of slimy, 
possibly odorous, biomass in or on wetted equip-
ment. Specific anaerobic bacteria found beneath
deposits can accelerate localized corrosion via
the metabolic acids generated by these species.
Other species, namely fungi, can deteriorate
wooden structures (cooling towers).
Fig. 6.5 illustrates the interrelationship of the water-related problems. For example, when a mild
steel pipe corrodes, a significant amount of soluble and insoluble iron is released, which can lead
to fouling. Should the pipe or water passage be sufficiently restricted, the lower flow may result in
localized overheating, resulting in scale formation. The presence of biological mass would only
compound the problem because it has high volume but relatively light mass. Anaerobic bacteria
beneath the deposition could result in a localized pitting attack.
The various undesirable properties of water can be combatted by the consideration of the follow-
ing:  materials of construction; steelmaking equipment design with sufficient water flows and
velocities; water treatment equipment designed to meet the intended use; operating modes; main-
tenance procedures; control of additives to the water, both intentional and incidental; and proper
chemical treatment.
Because there are usually several possible alternatives or combinations of measures which can be
applied, and because two or more problems can co-exist, selection of the proper methods for water
use and treatment is a highly specialized activity.
Table 6.26 briefly summarizes the most common water treatment techniques for various constituents.
6.6.3 Water Use by Steelmaking Processes
Because of the great variety of steelmaking facilities, their layout, discharge limitations, and avail-
able water supplies, water usage varies widely in both integrated and mini-mill facilities. In the fol-
lowing paragraphs, some specific water uses are discussed.
6.6.3.1 Cooling Water
By far, the largest application and usage of water in iron and steelmaking is for cooling purposes.
In addition to categorization by contact and non-contact criteria, cooling water systems use can be
generalized in the following categories.
6.6.3.1.1 Once-through Systems
Water is used once prior to discharge, as in the cooling of con-
densers, furnace components, and other miscellaneous applications. This mode of cooling is typi-
cally in non-contact cooling applications where the water is intentionally restricted from coming
into contact with the steel in process or resultant process streams originating from the facility, such
as exhaust gas, steelmaking fluids, etc. This approach is more prevalent in mills located adjacent
to large water bodies, rivers, lakes, and at times, oceans.
6.6.3.1.2 Evaporative Recirculating Systems
Both contact and non-contact applications utilize evapo-
rative systems. When water absorbs heat from a process, this heat can be easily transferred to the
environment (air) by exposing the water to the atmosphere. This evaporation reduces the bulk water

temperature, enabling the water to be reused. This cooling method is commonly used in evapora-
tive cooling towers, and to a lesser extent, in lagoons and spray ponds.
In non-contact systems, the limit to which water can be recycled in this manner is dependent on
the water quality requirements of the process being cooled, the raw water quality, and ambient air
temperature. As the water is evaporated, the minerals and other constituents for the most part
remain in the water and become concentrated. This concentration mechanism increases the TDS in

the system and, if not compensated, may lead to water-related problems, as discussed in Section
6.6.2. Normally, the TDS concentration in the system is controlled by bleeding off some of the
water from the system (blowdown).
The same is true for contact cooling water systems, and consideration must be given to the con-
stituents originating from the process. These systems often require some treatment for the removal
of solids, oil, etc., prior to cooling and recycle.
In both contact and non-contact cooling systems, the amount of recycle that is obtainable is highly
dependent on the water quality requirements and constraints of the systems being cooled. Because
of this, some discharge blowdown is required from these systems to maintain the desired water
quality. The balance for an evaporative water system is dictated by the following interrelationship
between makeup, evaporation, and blowdown. (Note that blowdown in this equation includes
uncontrolled losses such as tower drift, windage losses, exhaust entrainment, spillage, and leakage.)
Makeup (MU) 5 Evaporation (EV) 1 Blowdown (BD)
(6.6.1)
Cycles of concentration and concentration ratio are terms used to indicate the degree of concen-
tration of the recirculating water as compared to that of the makeup water. The degree of concen-
tration is dictated by the relationship of makeup to blowdown, given that evaporation (heat load) is
constant over time. The evaporating water is pure water vapor, leaving behind soluble water impu-
rities that can be measured. Analytically, measurement of these dissolved minerals in the makeup
and blowdown can also indicate this concentration phenomenon as shown below:
(6.6.2)
An accepted rule of thumb to estimate evaporation in a recirculating system is for every 6°C (10°F)
temperature drop across the evaporative process, 1% of the recirculating water is lost to evapora-
tion. This 1% rule of thumb may vary. In areas of high humidity (Gulf Coast), evaporative loss may
be as low as 0.75%, while in arid areas, as high as 1.2%. A second method to determine makeup
(MU) is as follows:
(6.6.3)
In direct contact systems, when water is applied to hot steel in process, analytical measurement of
dissolved salts may be skewed. Some of the mineral content may precipitate out on the hot surface
of steel in process as the water evaporates. Conversely, soluble elements from the process may also
dissolve in the water, increasing their level, as in the gas cleaning applications of water.
6.6.3.1.3 Non-evaporative (Closed) Recirculation Systems
Incorporating the use of a heat exchanger
mechanism, the recirculated water system heat is transferred to a second water system or to the air
through conductive cooling. This transfer is accomplished through water/water heat exchangers of
plate and frame or shell and tube design, or through air coolers of wet surface or dry design. The
same cooling water is used in a continuous cycle with little or no water loss. Usually associated
with higher water quality applications, these systems are typically not exposed directly to the envi-
ronment and do not have a concentration mechanism. In everyday life, the automobile radiator
cooling system is a common example of a closed loop cooling system.
6.6.3.1.4 Application of Cooling Water Systems
Most once-through systems are limited to non-contact
or indirect cooling applications. Previously, contact or direct cooling applications were of the once-
through design, but these generally have been converted to recirculating systems, incorporating
primarily evaporative cooling towers to meet discharge requirements. Most closed non-evaporative
systems are used to cool process equipment requiring higher quality water in terms of hardness,
suspended solids, and dissolved solids. Often these requirements necessitate pretreatment of the
water to meet the desired characteristics.

In terms of water resource management, many mills utilize cascading water systems, whereby
water is intentionally transferred from one system to another. A common example would be to use
the blowdown from a non-contact system as makeup to a contact system. Rarely is the reverse
employed without additional treatment because the contact waters may contain potentially trou-
blesome constituents originated from the steelmaking process. Because of constituent levels in
contact water, the use of non-contact water is preferred in indirect heat exchange equipment, where
practical and feasible. In some applications, boiler feed water is required.

tions.

6.6.3.2.1 Coke and Coal Chemical Plants
The largest volume of water used in these plants is for non-
contact cooling in a variety of cooling and condensing operations. Moisture from the coal being
coked and from process steam condensation makes the byproduct operation a net generator of
process water. Process wastewater sources include:  excess ammonia liquor from the primary
cooler tar decanter, and barometric condenser wastewater from the crystallizer, the final coolers,
light oil recovery operations, desulfurization processes, and air pollution control operations. Most
of the wastewater generated at the coke plant results from moisture in the coal and steam conden-
sate. Additional sources can include condensates from drip legs and gas lines.
The largest consumption of water in coke plants is for the quenching of coke. The amount of water
required for coke quenching can vary and has been reported to be from 400 to 3000 litres/tonne
(120 to 900 gallons per ton). A sufficient quantity of water is needed to cool the coke, yet leave
enough heat in the coke to evaporate any entrained water. Some facilities utilize untreated process
wastewater for coke quenching, while others use treated process waters or service waters. In some
areas, the level of TDS in the quench water must be controlled due to potential air pollution con-
cerns. This requirement has impacted the use of untreated process wastewater in coke quenching.
6.6.3.2.2  Sinter Plants
The principal uses of water in a sintering plant are for controlling the mois-
ture content of the pre-sinter mix, for dust control, and for sinter product cooling. Some indirect
cooling of equipment is involved. For emissions control in sinter plants, either electrostatic pre-
cipitator or wet venturi-type scrubber technology is typically employed for dust control. In precip-
itator applications, some water may be added to control exhaust temperature and to condition the
particulate prior to capture.
In scrubber systems, water is sprayed into the gas stream to capture the emissions from the sinter
operation to meet stack emissions requirements. The associated water system will typically include
clarifying thickeners, a cooling tower, and pH Adjustment.
6.6.3.2.3  Blast Furnace
The blast furnace is one of the largest water users in an integrated steel mill
operation. The primary water use is for non-contact cooling of various parts of the furnace and aux-
iliaries, including the tuyeres, hearth staves, bosh, cooling plates and staves, cinder notch, and stove
valves. The historical approach has been to use once-through cooling water, but recent construc-
tion and modernizations have incorporated evaporative cooling systems along with closed-loop
water systems for hot blast valves, tuyeres, and staves. Additional water is used for furnace mois-
ture injection (steam), dust control, and slag granulation.
Contact water use is primarily associated with blast-furnace gas cleaning operations necessary to
recover the fuel value of the offgas for use in stove and boiler operations. In venturi-type scrubbers
and spray-cooled gas coolers, water contacts, cleans, and cools the gas for reuse. This water sys-
tem usually consists of thickeners, dewatering devices, and evaporative cooling towers. Chemical
treatment may consist of settling aids, pH adjustment, and inhibitors, depending on the nature of
the particulate and gas exiting the furnace. As the amount of recycle is increased in these systems,
the control of total dissolved solids (TDS) and the increased concentration of specifically moni-
tored elements or compounds become concerns.
Treatment for the reduction of TDS would be dependent upon the parameters of concern and could
involve more sophisticated treatment systems. Typically, the blast-furnace process waters contain
ammonia, phenols, cyanide, lead, and zinc. Additional treatment for these parameters may be
required prior to discharge of any blowdown from the recycle system. In many facilities, a signif-
icant portion of the recirculated water can be consumed rather than discharged by utilizing it for
slag quenching.
6.6.3.2.4  Alternative Iron Technologies
With the increased tonnage produced via the electric arc fur-
nace, the direct reduced iron, iron carbide, and Corex processes play a meaningful role in the steel
industry. Likewise, they also have water requirements. Because these technologies produce a
source of iron units in varying forms, their process requirements can be similar to those of a blast
furnace. However, their gas handling system is much more complex due to the nature of the tech-
nologies. In general, each of these processes has non-contact cooling requirements for compres-

sors, coolers, and various furnace shell components. Closed non-evaporative systems are prevalent
for this application.
The gas exiting the shaft furnace in these processes is utilized extensively in the process and
requires cleaning prior to reuse. Wet scrubbers are installed in the dirty system to perform this
function. The water system usually consists of thickeners, dewatering devices, and evaporative
cooling towers. Chemical treatment may consist of settling aids, pH adjustment, and inhibitors
because of the nature of the particulate and gas composition in the dirty gas exiting the furnace.
A clean gas contact system, using water mainly as a process gas coolant, is also used to maintain
process gas temperature requirements. This system is cooled via an open evaporative cooling tower.
Water treatment to meet the process requirements for each of the systems can be extensive. The
contact systems in particular may require extensive water treatment and quality adjustment in
process to maintain plant operations.
6.6.3.2.5  Electric Arc Furnaces
The EAF can also be an extensive user of water, particularly for non-
contact cooling functions. In the melt shop, emissions in the exhaust gas stream are typically han-
dled using baghouse technology, requiring no contact water. Non-contact water applications
include water-cooled ductwork, roof, sidewalls, doors, injection lances, panels, electrode clamps,
cables, and arms. These systems usually incorporate evaporative cooling towers, while a number
of applications incorporate closed cooling loops. Some applications utilize closed-loop high-purity
systems for electrical apparatus cooling requiring low conductivity (dissolved solids) water. As
with other primary operations, the control of TDS in evaporative cooling systems for electric arc
furnaces is a significant concern.
6.6.3.2.6  Basic Oxygen Furnace
The BOF and its derivatives are extensive users of water. Non-
contact cooling is used for the vessel hood, ductwork, trunnion, and oxygen lance. Both closed-
loop and evaporative systems are prevalent for handling the cooling requirements for these com-
ponents, based on manufacturer recommendations. The trend for hood cooling in recent years has
been toward the closed-loop cooling approach to extend hood life. Some BOF hoods are steam
generating, with water requirements similar to those of high pressure boiler applications.
Gas handling for the various basic oxygen processes can be categorized as either full combustion
(open) or suppressed combustion (closed) hood systems. In full combustion systems, excess air is
allowed to enter the exhaust stream in the hood. This enables the oxygen blow to accomplish a
complete reaction, converting CO to CO2. In suppressed combustion systems, the hood is skirted
to prevent excess air from entering the exhaust. Typically, the amount of particulate emissions gen-
erated by either approach equals 1–3% of the steel tonnage produced. The suppressed combustion
approach has gained favor because the particulate generated is generally larger (except in the OBM
or Q-BOP process), the temperatures generated in the hood are generally lower, and the volume of
gas is lower, thereby reducing the size of the equipment required to convey and clean the gas.
In either full or suppressed combustion gas cleaning systems, water is used for initial cooling of
the gas in the ductwork and/or in a quencher to reduce gas temperature and volume. Full combus-
tion gas cleaning systems can incorporate either electrostatic precipitator (semi-wet) or venturi
scrubber (wet) technology. After initial conditioning in a precipitator-based system, little or no
water is used because the captured dust is handled on a dry basis. Precipitators are generally not
used on suppressed combustion systems because the potential for explosion exists due to the pres-
ence of CO gas; the few facilities with suppressed combustion and precipitators have incorporated
design considerations accommodating the potential explosion hazards.
The scrubber-based system typically incorporates separate quencher and venturi-type scrubbers for
gas cooling and cleaning purposes. The auxiliary water systems typically consist of a clarifying
thickener and dewatering devices for the solids captured. Upon exiting the thickener, the cleaned
water is returned to the venturi, typically without cooling. After the venturi scrubber, the venturi
effluent is typically reused as supply to the quencher. In some facilities, a separate gas cooler with
a dedicated cooling tower is in line, after the scrubber but prior to the exhaust fan and stack.

Because of the lime carryover in the exhaust gas, the high gas temperature, and the fine particu-
late nature of the dust evolved, water-related problems, including mineral precipitation and foul-
ing, can interfere with scrubber operations. Problems include plugging of the venturi nozzles and
fouling in the venturi/quencher throats. Various water quality treatment approaches are incorpo-
rated, including pH/alkalinity control, solids management, and various inhibitor programs.
6.6.3.2.7  Ladle Metallurgy Furnace
Water usage for the LMF is similar to the EAF, although its func-
tion and design are different. Non-contact water is used to cool the roof, clamps, arms, cables, and
associated equipment. Cooling is typically via an open recirculating system and is combined with
the EAF system if plant layout allows.
6.6.3.2.8  Vacuum Degasser
Water usage is primarily associated with the vacuum generating/gas
cleaning system. The vacuum is generated by injecting steam through multi-point eductors leading
to a barometric condenser. As the steel exhaust emissions are drawn in contact with the steam, the
particulate is wetted and collects in the condenser water. The water system may consist of an evap-
orative cooling tower, solids settling, and solids removal equipment.
Depending on the facility design, non-contact water may be used to meet equipment cooling
requirements. Typically, these cooling requirements will be met by evaporative towers associated
with the EAF/LMF facilities.
6.6.3.2.9  Continuous Casting
Water use and quality are critical to the success of continuous casting.
Water use in the caster is categorized by function in the casting process:  primary (mold); sec-
ondary (spray); and auxiliary (equipment). When continuous casting was initially adopted by the
steel industry, little attention was given to water quality and one evaporatively cooled system was
installed to provide the cooling requirements.
As with the casting process itself, water management practices evolved as demands for equipment
reliability and quality grew. A significant improvement was made when the mold circuit was iso-
lated as a non-contact (closed) system, virtually eliminating process contamination and mineral
scaling as the cause for mold related failures. Further improvements were made when contact cool-
ing and non-contact requirements were separated into separate water systems.
The primary cooling process is the non-contact cooling of the molten steel shell in the mold to its
semi-finished form by passing high quality water through a highly conductive copper mold.
Closed-loop non-evaporative cooling is primarily employed when high surface and strand quality
are required. Because of the high heat flux encountered in the mold, pretreatment is normally spec-
ified for removal of scale-forming constituents. Open recirculating evaporative systems are some-
times used where makeup water quality and caster quality requirements allow.
Secondary or spray cooling occurs as the strand exits the mold, with contact water sprays covering
the surface of the strand. Spray cooling allows for the extraction of heat as it migrates from the
molten core to the surface until solidification is complete. This contact water system will typically
incorporate settling basins (scale pits), oil skimmers, straining devices, and deep bed filtration
equipment when low suspended solids levels are to be maintained. Water treatment should include
consideration of contamination from grease, hydraulic fluids, and mold lubricants that will be col-
lected and concentrated in this system. As with other contact systems, this system will typically
utilize evaporative tower systems for cooling.
Auxiliary cooling is non-contact or internal cooling of the casting equipment. Applications typi-
cally include heat exchangers, internal roll cooling, frames, bearings, compressors, exposed instru-
mentation, and other miscellaneous components. Evaporative cooling systems are prevalent for
these applications. Electromagnetic stirring devices and high temperature exposed components
such as center bearings may require the installation of closed-loop cooling systems, which may
require high-quality water.
Cascading water systems are not unusual in caster systems as water quality requirements are typi-
cally less stringent for contact systems than for non-contact systems. Cascading often occurs unin-
tentionally because of equipment leaks during normal operations.

6.6.3.2.10  Hot Rolling Mills
After casting, the semi-finished steel is transferred to a reheat furnace
to bring the metal to a uniform temperature. Whether the furnace is of skid, walking beam, or tun-
nel design, non-contact cooling water is typically utilized to provide the cooling for doors, inter-
nally cooled rolls, skid pipes, beams, bearings, and miscellaneous equipment. Though
once-through water can be used, an evaporative cooling tower is generally employed to allow water
recycle.
In a thin slab caster complex, the strip enters the finishing stands directly, after passing through a
continuous in-line reheating furnace. Direct rolling of thin cast slabs without reheating is more
energy efficient and thus requires less indirect non-contact cooling water.
In the hot mill, the mill stand work rolls are cooled by a contact water system to maintain roll con-
tour, to prevent surface cracking of the steel rolls due to sudden temperature changes, to minimize
fire checking, and to generally extend roll life. Water is used in the form of high pressure jets to
remove scale from the steel (descale) before rolling to maintain surface quality. It is also used
between certain roll stands to maintain surface cleanliness of the steel in process. In addition, water
is used as flume flushing to transport the scale to the scale pits for removal. When the product is
coiled, cooling sprays or laminar cooling are employed to cool the strip to enable the coiling oper-
ation.
The rolling mill water system will typically incorporate settling basins (scale pits), oil skimmers,
straining devices, solids removal with clarifiers and/or deep bed filtration equipment (when low
suspended solids levels are to be maintained), and a cooling tower. Wastewater treatment should
include consideration of contamination from fine mill scale, grease, hydraulic fluids, and rolling oils
which will be collected in this system. The laminar system used on the runout tables may be sep-
arated from the rolling mill, with separate settling, cooling, straining, and water filtration facilities.
6.6.3.2.11  Finishing Mills
In finishing operations including pickling, cold reduction, annealing, tem-
per, cleaner, and coating lines (tin, galvanized, terne, etc.), water is used primarily as non-contact
cooling water, solution makeup, and rinse water. Non-contact cooling typically incorporates evap-
orative cooling towers, while some equipment may include closed-loop systems to meet specific
high purity water quality requirements. Typical process wastewaters from these operations include
rinses and spent concentrates from alkaline cleaners, pickling solutions, plating solutions, and elec-
trochemical treating solutions. Many technologies are being utilized to recycle and/or reuse the
concentrated solutions; however, the rinse waters require treatment to meet discharge requirements.
In treatment of these wastewaters, consideration should be given to the type of plating solutions,
cleaners, and pickling solutions utilized; oil and grease; dissolved metals; organic compounds; and
lubricants that may be present in the wastewater.
6.6.4  Treatment of Effluent Water
In the iron and steelmaking industry, as in any major industry, the large volumes of process water
that come into direct contact with the raw materials, products, and offgases must be treated for
removal of regulated parameters prior to discharge or reuse of water. As discussed previously, the
main operations in an integrated steel plant that require wastewater treatment include cokemaking;
ironmaking; steelmaking; hot and cold rolling; and finishing operations such as pickling, elec-
trolytic tinning, and other coating processes.
For the iron and steel industry, the parameters of most significance, which are generally regulated
by the terms of discharge permits, are suspended solids, oil and grease, phenol, cyanide, ammonia,
and heavy metals such as lead, zinc, chromium, and nickel. In addition, several organic compounds
that are on the priority pollutant list compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are
regulated for cokemaking and cold rolling operations. The following discussion describes the con-
ventional wastewater treatment technologies employed for effective treatment of steel industry
wastewaters. Table 6.28 presents a summary of where these technologies would be applicable in
steel mill operations.

6.6.4.1 Control of Suspended Solids
Removal of suspended solids is necessary for the wastewaters from practically all of the produc-
tion steps in the iron and steel industry, from cokemaking to product finishing. Solid particulates
become suspended in process water streams during cleaning and cooling of flue gases, descaling,
roll and product cooling, and flume flushing in rolling mills, and during product rinsing in finish-
ing operations. The three general methods for removing suspended solids are sedimentation, cen-
trifugal separation, and filtration. Sedimentation or clarification, which is settling by gravity, can
be accomplished in a clarifier or inclined plate separator specially designed for a given application.
Clarifiers are generally circular but also may be constructed in a rectangular shape. An advantage
of inclined plate separators over clarifiers is that inclined plate separators occupy much less ground
space; however, care should be exercised in their use when the wastewater contains a high oil and
grease concentration. The disadvantage is the small storage volume for sludge at the bottom of
inclined plate separators. Both clarifiers and inclined plate separators are designed for continuous
removal of the collected sludge from the bottom of the unit. The underflow sludge may be gravity
thickened before being further dewatered in one of several types of sludge dewatering units such
as a filter press, a belt press, or a centrifuge, to reduce the volume for ease in handling and econ-
omy of disposal.
Coagulant aids, such as alum, ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride, and
commercial organic polyelectrolytes, are often added to the wastewater prior to clarification to pro-
mote flocculation of the solid particles, which increases their effective size and thus increases their
settling rate.
Centrifugal separation is a technique to remove suspended materials from the water column via
centrifugal forces, sometimes termed cyclone separation. The process is highly dependent upon
particle size and specific gravity. Larger particles and higher specific gravity enhances perfor-
mance.
Multi-media or single media filtration, by either pressure or gravity, is another method for removal
of fine suspended particulates which is commonly applied to steel industry wastewaters. The water
is passed through a filter media contained in a vessel. The system usually is comprised of a num-
ber of individual filtration units in parallel. Often side-stream filtration can be utilized to treat a
portion of the wastewater that is then blended with the unfiltered portion. It is desirable to design

a filter system with the highest feasible flow rate through the filter media to minimize the required
size and cost.
In a typical multi-media system, the water first passes through a relatively coarse layer of media
such as anthracite coal, and then through a layer of fine sand. Most of the particulates are removed
by the coarse layer, while the fine layer does the final polishing. Multi-media filters are often used
when oil and grease concentrations are elevated in the wastewaters. High oil and grease concen-
trations can result in fouling and/or plugging of the media in both single and multi-media filters.
Periodically, the collected particulate must be removed from the filter media by backwashing. In
this operation, the influent flow of wastewater is shut off and a stream of treated water, and occa-
sionally air, is passed through the filter in the opposite direction to flush out the collected solids.
By having a number of filter units installed in parallel, one unit can be put through the backwash
cycle without interrupting the continuous treatment of the wastewater stream. The backwash
stream is usually settled in a backwash holding tank, and the solids are processed through a thick-
ener and sludge dewatering equipment. Both single media and multi-media filters can produce a
high degree of clarity in effluent streams. However, clarifiers should be considered for pretreat-
ment of wastewater heavily laden with solids to remove the majority of the particulates prior to fil-
tration. Filters can be used alone without prior clarification for waste streams with less solids.
The quantity of suspended solids and other particulates discharged to a receiving stream can usu-
ally be greatly reduced by recirculating the water back to the process. However, the degree of recir-
culation that is feasible is limited by the amount of suspended solids present in the wastewater and
the buildup in the concentration of dissolved salts in the system, which can eventually lead to depo-
sition and plugging in equipment and piping. Therefore, a certain portion of the circulating water
volume must be released as blowdown to control the concentration of dissolved salts to a tolerable
level.
6.6.4.2 Control of Oil
Oil and grease are commonly found in wastewaters from continuous casting, hot and cold rolling,
pickling, electroplating, and coating operations. The oils originate from machinery and product
lubricants and coolants; hydraulic systems; and preservative coatings applied during certain phases
of the production operations. Oil and grease can be removed from process wastewaters by several
methods including skimming, filtration, gravity separation, air flotation, and ultrafiltration. If the
oils are insoluble in water, they can be controlled by gravity separation and skimming. Gravity oil
separators are usually rectangular chambers in which the velocity of the water stream is slowed
down sufficiently to allow time for the oil to float to the surface, from where it is removed by one
of several types of skimming devices. Such devices include the rotary drum, rope and belt type
skimmers, and scraper blades, which are also used to scrape the heavier solids that have settled to
the bottom. Insoluble oils also can be removed along with suspended solids in the multi-media fil-
ters previously described. If the oils are emulsified or water soluble, such as those found in waste
cold rolling solutions or rinse waters, they can be treated by acid or commercial emulsion break-
ers to break the emulsion, followed by gravity sedimentation and skimming, or by air flotation
and/or membrane separation techniques.
Skimming may be used on any wastewater containing constituents that float to the surface and is
commonly used to remove free oil, grease, and soaps. Skimming is often used with air flotation or
clarification to improve removal of both settling and floating materials. The removal efficiency of
a skimmer is a function of the density of the material to be floated and the retention time of the
wastewater in the tank. API or other gravity-type separators tend to be more suitable for use where
the amount of surface oil flowing through the system is fairly high and consistent.
Air flotation is a process that is used to separate floatable materials having a specific gravity close
to that of water, which therefore cannot be effectively separated by gravity alone. In a flotation sys-
tem, gas bubbles, usually air, are released in the wastewater and attach to the oil and fine solid par-
ticles, causing them to float more rapidly to the surface where they are skimmed off as a froth.

381

Foam, dispersed air, dissolved air, gravity, and vacuum flotation are the most commonly used tech-
niques. Chemical additives are often used to enhance the performance of the flotation process.
Ultrafiltration (UF) includes the use of pressure and semi-permeable polymeric or ceramic mem-
branes to separate emulsified or colloidal materials suspended in a liquid phase. The membrane of
an ultrafiltration unit forms a molecular screen which retains molecular particles based upon their
differences in size, shape, and chemical structure. The membrane permits passage of solvents and
lower molecular weight molecules.
In the ultrafiltration process, the wastewater is pumped through a tubular membrane unit. Water
and some low molecular weight materials pass through the membrane under the applied pressure
of 10 to 100 psig. Emulsified oil droplets and suspended particles are retained, concentrated, and
removed continuously.
6.6.4.3 Control of Heavy Metals
Limitations on the discharge of heavy metals have been established by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) for steel industry process waters from blast furnaces; steelmaking fur-
naces; and pickling, cold rolling, electroplating, and hot coating operations. The conventional
method used for removal of these trace metals is chemical precipitation followed by clarification
or filtration. As shown in Fig. 6.6, the solubility of heavy metals in water is a function of pH.
Generally, metals become less soluble as the pH increases; therefore, to remove dissolved metals,
a wastewater stream is treated with an alkaline material in a mixing tank with a pH controller.

Solubility of metal hydroxides
and sulfides as a function of pH. From
Ref. 77.

Common chemical precipitation processes include hydroxide and sulfide precipitation. In hydrox-
ide precipitation, lime, which is the least expensive reagent, is most often used, although caustic
soda, magnesium hydroxide, or other alkali may also be employed for this purpose. After the pH
is raised to a level where the dissolved metals will precipitate as hydroxides, the water passes to
either a clarifier and/or a filter for removal of the precipitated solids. The addition of a coagulant
aid is usually required. The use of a coagulating agent such as ferric chloride at an alkaline pH
results in the formation of an oxy-hydroxide surface, which enhances additional removal of metals
by adsorption. Other coagulants such as alum, ferrous sulfate, and polymeric flocculants also can
be used to enhance particle formation.
If chromium is present in the hexavalent form, it must first be chemically reduced to the trivalent
form before it will precipitate. The rate of this reduction reaction is a function of the pH condition
of the system. For example, the pH of the system must be adjusted to between 2.0 and 3.0 if sul-
fur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, or spent pickle liquor is used as the reducing agent. Hexavalent
chromium can also be reduced to trivalent chromium with sodium hydrosulfite at a relatively
higher pH (between 8.5 and 9.5). The reduced trivalent chromium ion is then converted to insolu-
ble chromium hydroxide and is removed by sedimentation.
As indicated above, dissolved metal ions and certain anions may be chemically precipitated and
removed by physical means such as sedimentation or filtration. In addition to the use of alkaline
compounds, the following other reagents can be used:
1. Metal sulfides—Except for chromium sulfide, the solubility of metal sulfides is
lower than that of metal hydroxides (see Fig. 6.6). Therefore, the removal of dis-
solved metals can be enhanced using the sulfide precipitation process. Both soluble
sulfides, such as hydrogen sulfide or sodium sulfide, and insoluble sulfides, such
as ferrous sulfide, may be used to precipitate many heavy metal ions as insoluble
metal sulfides. Currently, the use of organic sulfide has become popular in the
wastewater treatment industry. Typically, the sulfide precipitation process includes
clarification and filtration.
2. Carbonates—Carbonate precipitates may be used to remove metals either by direct
precipitation using a carbonate reagent such as calcium carbonate or by converting
hydroxides into carbonates using carbon dioxide.
Chemical precipitation as a mechanism for removing metals from wastewater is a complex process
consisting of at least two steps:  precipitation of the unwanted metals and removal of the precipi-
tate. A small amount of metal will remain dissolved in the wastewater after complete precipitation.
The amount of residual dissolved metal depends on the treatment chemicals used, the solubility of
the metal, and co-precipitation effects. The effectiveness of this method of removing any specific
metal depends on the fraction of the specific metal in the raw waste (and hence in the precipitate)
and the effectiveness of suspended solids removal.
6.6.4.4 Biological Treatment
Biological oxidation is the most commonly applied technology for final treatment of coke plant
wastewaters. These waters contain significant levels of phenol, cyanide, thiocyanate, and ammo-
nia, plus lesser concentrations of other organic compounds, primarily as a result of condensation
from coke-oven gases that contain these substances. A conventional system for treatment of coke
plant waste would include ammonia distillation followed by biological oxidation. The ammonia
still system may have a free leg, where dissolved gaseous ammonia is removed by steam distilla-
tion, and a fixed leg, where ionized ammonia is converted to free ammonia by alkali addition, and
then is removed in the free leg. While this distillation process will remove a large percentage of the
ammonia and some of the free cyanide from the water, enough of these constituents will remain in
the ammonia still effluent, in addition to phenol, thiocyanate, and other organics to require further
treatment, such as biological oxidation, prior to disposal.

383

Because biological oxidation is highly sensitive to fluctuations in constituent loadings and pH, the
effluent from the ammonia still is first passed through an equalization basin to level out the con-
centrations, temperature, and flow volume. Conventional systems consist of either a single-stage
or two-stage system. In a single-stage system, the process is designed to reduce the organic com-
pounds as well as ammonia. In a typical two-stage system, the first stage is designed to reduce the
organic compounds and the second stage is utilized for nitrification (ammonia removal).
Sometimes, with careful control, both carbonaceous and nitrogen treatment can occur in the same
aeration basin. It should be noted that the biological treatment of thiocyanates results in an increase
of ammonia in the wastewater. This must be accounted for in the design of the treatment system.
Both aeration systems typically utilize an activated sludge process, followed by a clarifier. The acti-
vated sludge process is a suspended growth process similar to that applied in sewage treatment
plants. In the aeration system, a mass of microorganisms or biomass in the form of suspended
solids, called an activated sludge, is supplied with oxygen, which enables it to reduce the biologi-
cally degradable constituents in the wastewater. Populations of microorganisms can be developed
that can effectively degrade phenol and other organics, thiocyanate, free cyanide, and ammonia.
The required oxygen is supplied either by mechanical surface aerators or by diffusion of air bub-
bles through the basin, with or without the use of submerged turbine mixers. The treated water
overflows the basin to a clarifier, where the activated sludge is settled out to be recycled to the aer-
ation basin. The overflow water from the clarifier is discharged. Other biological treatment
processes also can be used, including fixed film, packed towers, fluidized beds, and suspended
growth processes with integral clarification.
6.6.4.5 Terminal Treatment
A common practice in wastewater treatment within the steel industry is to combine wastes from
several different types of operations for treatment in a so-called terminal treatment plant. This prac-
tice has been particularly successful in the handling of wastes from the various finishing opera-
tions. These wastes typically might contain suspended solids, free and emulsified oils from cold
rolling, acids from pickling rinse waters, and heavy metals from pickling and coating processes. In
a typical system, acid streams are mixed with the emulsified oil streams to break the emulsions.
The combined wastes are then passed through a gravity-oil separator, neutralized with lime to
remove acids and precipitate heavy metals, and treated for removal of solids and any remaining oils
in a clarifier or filter. This general type of terminal treatment system can be applied for environ-
mental control of a number of different steel industry processes more economically than the alter-
native of providing a separate treatment system for each process.
6.6.4.6 Breakpoint Chlorination
Chlorination is one of the technologies recognized by U.S. EPA for the treatment of ammonia, phe-
nols, and free cyanide. Chlorine has long been utilized as a biocide in municipal drinking water
facilities and is known for its strong oxidation potential. When chlorine is added to water, hydrol-
ysis of the chlorine molecule occurs, creating hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions which
together comprise the free available chlorine. Alkaline chlorination (at pH > 9.5 in the presence of
excess chlorine) is required for the destruction of free cyanide.
The term breakpoint chlorination comes from the observation of the point of the maximum reduc-
tion of chlorine residual while subjecting a sample to increasing chlorine dosages. The theoretical
chlorine dosage for the treatment of ammonia is 7.6 parts of chlorine to one part of ammonia. In
practice, dosages of 8:1 to 10:1 may be required. The optimum pH is usually in the range of 6.0 to
7.0. Care must be taken to provide sufficient chlorine to complete the reaction to avoid the forma-
tion of chloroamines. Additionally, the competing demand from phenols, nitrite, ferrous iron, sul-
fites, hydrogen sulfide, free cyanide, and other organics must be accounted for in the total chlorine
demand. Alkalinity may also need to be added to the wastewater to maintain the desired pH.
Approximately 14.3 mg/litre of alkalinity (as CaCO3) is consumed for each 1.0 mg/litre of ammo-

nia nitrogen oxidized. In some cases, dechlorination of the final discharge will be required. This
can be accomplished by adding sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, or activated carbon.
The advantages of the process are that it has rather consistent process performance, has low space
requirements, and can reduce the ammonia concentrations in one step. The disadvantages of this
treatment method are the potential formation of trihalomethanes (THM), an increase in total dis-
solved solids (TDS), and the relatively high operating costs. This is why the technology is usually
only applied to treat small concentrations of contaminants, or as a polishing treatment.
6.6.5 Effluent Limitations
The Federal Clean Water Act has established effluent limitations for any discharge to a river or lake
(public waterway) or to the local publicly owned treatment works (POTW). A direct discharge to a
river or lake is regulated by a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). The terms of each individual permit can vary from state to state and watershed to water-
shed. However, at a minimum, the discharge from an existing facility must meet the Effluent
Limitation Guidelines (ELG) for the discharge to a public waterway or to a POTW. These guide-
lines were developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are established as
regulations in 40 CFR 420.
U.S. EPA reviewed the parameters of concern for each category of iron and steel manufacturing
operation and established effluent limitations accordingly. This information is presented in the
Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Iron and Steel
Industry published by the U.S. EPA. These guidelines establish specific categorical limitations for
discharges to public waterways and to POTWs. The limitations were developed based on the pro-
duction operations in industrial facilities as well as the number of tons per day of product produced.
The limitations are intended to be uniform treatment standards, such that the location of the facility
is not meaningful. The U.S. EPA established limitations for existing sources as well as new sources.
The Agency evaluated the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT) and the
best available technology economically achievable (BAT) for each steelmaking process. In some
cases, the U.S. EPA indicated that BPT is equivalent to BAT and established BPT as BAT. For our
purposes, these cases are referred to as BAT in the following text. All existing sources discharging
to a public waterway have to meet the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
All existing sources discharging to a POTW have to meet Pretreatment Standards for Existing
Sources (PSES) limitations. Similarly, all new sources have to meet New Source Performance
Standards (NSPS) or Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS).
In addition to the federally-mandated effluent limitations, the states have the authority to impose
more restrictive conditions in order to comply with local water quality standards. The more restric-
tive of the federal or state water quality limitations will be imposed in the NPDES permit. Local
municipalities can also impose more restrictive effluent limitations for discharge into their sewer
system, based on their need to meet state water quality standards or the ability of the POTW to han-
dle the parameters of concern.
It should be noted that the achievable limitations proposed by U.S. EPA, and summarized below,
were used to establish effluent limitation guidelines as published in Federal Regulations 40 CFR
420. These regulations establish limitations on a production basis and are presented as lb/1000 lb
of a product or kg/1000 kg. These limitations are typically presented as a maximum for any one
day (daily maximum) and an average of daily values for 30 consecutive days (monthly average).
Historically, the U.S. EPA has utilized production data from the previous five-year period and has
calculated the limitations based on the highest actual monthly production converted to a daily
value. This is done by dividing the monthly production by the number of operating shifts in that
month and then multiplying by three to determine a daily production rate. The production value
is then multiplied by the factors in 40 CFR 420 to calculate the effluent limits. The achievable

limitations presented below and the associated treatment methodologies are all taken from the U.S.
EPA development document. This information is presented as a guideline; it is not intended to rep-
resent an absolute condition. There are many ways of achieving the required effluent limitations,
including alternate treatment methods and/or alternate flow reduction methods. Additionally, the
model flows presented in this text are not intended to be requirements to achieve BPT or BAT;
rather, these flows are simply guidelines that U.S. EPA believes could be achieved. Table 6.29 pre-
sents a general summary of the treatment technologies utilized for the parameters of concern in
steel making wastewaters.

The expected effluent quality of the treated wastewaters from each of the steelmaking operations
is shown in daily maximum and monthly average values in Table 6.30. Note that these values are
based on BAT treatment systems. New facilities would have more restrictive effluent limitations
as defined under the NSPS. Following Table 6.30 is a discussion of the recommended treatment
system for each of the major steel making operations.
6.6.5.1 Cokemaking
The BAT treatment system for cokemaking consists of:  1. the recycle of crystallized wastewaters,
if any, to minimize the flow to be treated; 2. the treatment of the remaining wastewater flow in a
two-stage or extended biological system. Fig. 6.7 presents the treatment system while Table 6.31
provides the model flows.
6.6.5.2 Sintering
The BAT treatment system for the sintering process involves recycling process wastewaters and
filtering a blowdown flow of 120 gal/ton to reduce the levels of toxic materials and suspended
solids. The pH of the effluent is adjusted using acid. The BAT system assumes a recycle rate of
92%. The system is illustrated in the Fig. 6.8.
6.6.5.3 Ironmaking
The BAT treatment system for ironmaking consists of recycling process wastewaters and treating
the blowdown, as shown in Fig. 6.9. The applied flow rate for BAT is 13,344 litres/tonne (3200
gal/ton). After recycling, the blowdown (70 gal/ton) may be treated with two-stage alkaline chlo-
rination, if required. Lime is added to the blowdown to raise the pH to 10.5 or greater. The toxic

metal precipitates and other suspended solids formed by lime addition are separated prior to alka-
line chlorination. Chlorine is added in a two-stage system. In the first reactor, chlorine converts the
cyanides to cyanates and oxidizes ammonia–N and phenolic compounds. As the wastewaters leave
the first reactor, acid is added to reduce the pH to 8.5. Additional chlorine is added in the second
reactor to complete the oxidation of the cyanides as well as residual ammonia–N and phenolic
compounds. The effluent is then dechlorinated with appropriate reducing agents prior to discharge.

The BAT treatment system for the wet subdivision consists of pH adjustment and solids separa-
tion, as shown in Fig. 6.10. Lime is added to increase the pH for the purpose of providing both dis-
solved and particulate toxic metals removal. The suspended solids generated in this process are
then removed. Final pH adjustment of the treated effluent is also required.
6.6.5.5 Vacuum Degassing
The BAT treatment system for the vacuum degassing process includes lime precipitation, sedi-
mentation, and pH control to remove dissolved and particulate toxic metals, as presented in Fig.
6.11. The applied and discharge flows are 1400 gal/ton and 25 gal/ton, respectively.
6.6.5.6 Continuous Casting
The model flow for continuous casting is 25 gal/ton. The BAT system includes recycling and treat-
ment of the blowdown with lime precipitation and sedimentation to remove both particulate and
dissolved toxic metals, as shown in Fig. 6.12.
6.6.5.7 Hot Forming
In the BAT treatment system for hot forming waste streams, the water discharged from the mill is
collected in a scale pit where large particles settle out and surface skimmers remove floating oils.
The BAT treatment system includes recycle of the process wastewaters followed by a roughing
clarifier and then a filter for additional suspended solids and oil removal, as presented in Fig. 6.13.
Depending on the hot forming subdivision, anywhere from 58 to 77% of the primary scale pit
effluent is recirculated to the mill. A vacuum filter is used to dewater the underflow from the clar-
ifier. Although EPA has suggested model flows for the hot forming processes, as presented in
Table 6.33, these recycle rates are not mandatory.
6.6.5.6 Salt Bath Descaling
The BAT system for oxidizing operations includes acidification followed by chemical reduction of
hexavalent chromium with sulfur dioxide, sodium metabisulfite, or sodium hydrosulfite. Chemical

The BAT treatment systems for the cold worked pipe and tube subdivision is divided into two fur-
ther categories: plants using water and plants using soluble oil solutions. For the plants using
water, the BAT treatment system includes settling of the raw wastewater in a primary scale pit
equipped with oil skimming equipment. All of the treated wastewater is then recycled to the
process. The BAT treatment system for the plants using soluble oil includes settling of the raw
wastewater in a primary scale pit equipped with oil skimming equipment that removes tramp oils.
Nearly all of the solution is then recycled to the process. The spent solution is periodically removed

The model flows in the alkaline cleaning subcategory are 250 gal/ton and 350 gal/ton for batch
and continuous operations, respectively. The BAT treatment system includes the following waste-
water treatment steps: equalization, oil skimming, neutralization with acid, and addition of a poly-
mer followed by sedimentation in a flocculation-clarifier, as shown in Fig. 6.16.
6.6.5.10 Hot Coating
The BAT flows in the hot coating subcategory are 600 gal/ton and 2400 gal/ton for strip, sheet, and
miscellaneous (SSM) and wire products and fasteners (WPF) , respectively. The treatment system
alternative selected for hot coating operations relies on flow reduction by recycling fume scrubber
wastewaters and limiting blowdown streams from the scrubber system to 15 gpm. This reduced
scrubber discharge is combined with the rinse water and treated in the BAT treatment system. The
BAT system for galvanizing consists of chrome reduction, equalization, pH adjustment, polymer
addition, and solids separation, as shown in Fig. 6.17. The BAT system for terne and other metals
is similar, but does not include a chromium reduction step.
6.6.6 Boiler Water Treatment

combustion of fossil fuels. Utilities account for the greatest share of this, but industrial plants also
produce enormous quantities of steam for process uses, often generating electric power through
turbines of a byproduct fuel (co-generation).
The treatment of water for steam generation is one of the most sophisticated branches of water
chemistry. An understanding of the fundamentals of boiler water chemistry is essential to the power
engineer who continually strives to increase the efficiency of the boilers and steam-using equipment.

The pressure and design of a boiler determine the quality of water it requires for steam generation.
Municipal or plant water of good quality for domestic use is seldom good enough for boiler feed
water. These sources of makeup are nearly always treated to reduce contaminants to acceptable lev-
els; in addition, corrective chemicals are added to the treated water to counteract any adverse
effects of the remaining trace contaminants. The sequence of treatment depends on the type and
concentration of contaminants found in the water supply and the desired quality of the finished
water to avoid the three major boiler system problems: deposits, corrosion, and carryover.
6.6.6.1 Deposits
Deposits, particularly scale, can form on any water-washed equipment surface, especially on boiler
tubes, as the equilibrium conditions in the water contacting these surfaces are upset by an external
force, such as heat. Each contaminant has an established solubility in water and will precipitate
when it has been exceeded. If the water is in contact with a hot surface and solubility of the cont-
aminant is lower at higher temperatures, the precipitate will form on the surface, causing scale. The
most common components of boiler water deposits are calcium phosphate, silicate, various forms
of iron oxide, silica adsorbed on the previously mentioned precipitates, and alumina; see Table
6.36. If phosphate salts are used to treat the boiler water, calcium will preferentially precipitate as
the phosphate before precipitating as the carbonate, and calcium phosphate becomes the most
prominent feature of the deposit.
At the high temperatures found in a boiler, deposits are a serious problem, causing poor heat trans-
fer and a potential for boiler tube failure. In low-pressure boilers with low heat transfer rates,
deposits may build up to a point where they completely occlude the boiler tube.
In modern intermediate and higher pressure boilers with heat transfer rates in excess of 5000
cal/m2/hr (200,000 Btu/ft2/h), the presence of even extremely thin deposits will cause a serious ele-
vation in the temperature of tube metal. The deposit coating retards the flow of heat from the fur-

nace gases into the boiler water. This heat resistance results in a rapid rise in metal temperature to
the point at which failure can occur. The action that takes place in the blistering of a tube by deposit
buildup is illustrated by Fig. 6.18. For simplification, no temperature drops through gas or water
films have been shown. Section A shows a cross section of the tube metal with a completely
deposit-free heating surface. There is a temperature drop across the tube metal from the outside
metal (T2) to the metal in contact with boiler water (T1). Section B illustrates this same tube after
the development of a heat-insulating deposit layer. In addition to the temperature drop from T2 to
T1, there would be an additional temperature drop through the deposit layer from T1 to T0. This con-
dition would, of course, result in a lower boiler water temperature T0. However, boiler water tem-
perature is fixed by the operating pressure, and operating conditions require that the same boiler
water temperature be maintained as before the development of the deposit layer. Section C illus-
trates the condition that actually develops. Starting at the base boiler water temperature of T0, the
increase through the scale layer is represented by the line from T0 to T3. The further temperature
increase through the tube wall is represented by the line from T3 to T4. The outside metal temper-
ature T4 is now considerably higher than the temperature T2, which was the outside metal temper-
ature prior to the formation of deposits on the tube surfaces.
If continued deposition takes place, increasing the thickness of the heat-insulating deposits, further
increases will take place in the tube metal temperature until the safe maximum temperature of the
tube metal is exceeded. Usually this maximum temperature is 480 to 540°C (900 to 1000°F). At
higher heat transfer rates, and in high-pressure boilers, the problem is more severe. At temperatures
in the 482 to 732°C (900 to 1350°F) range microstructural transformations take place in carbon
steel. At temperatures above 427°C (800°F) spheroidization of carbon begins to take place, with a
resultant reduction in strength properties. Temperatures within the boiler furnace are considerably
above this critical temperature range.
Water circulating through the tubes normally conducts heat away from the metal, preventing the
tube from reaching this range. Deposits insulate the tube, reducing the rate at which this heat can
be removed, as shown in Fig. 6.19; this leads to overheating and eventual tube failure. If the deposit
is not thick enough to cause such a failure, it can still cause a substantial loss in efficiency and dis-
ruption of the heat transfer load in other sections of the boiler.
Deposits may be scale, precipitated in situ on a heated surface, or previously precipitated chemi-
cals, often in the form of sludge. These drop out of water in low-velocity areas, compacting to form
a dense agglomerate similar to scale, but retaining the features of the original precipitates. In the
operation of most industrial boilers, it is seldom possible to avoid formation of some type of pre-
cipitate at some time. There are almost always some particulates in the circulating boiler water
which can deposit in low-velocity sections, such as the mud drum. The exception would be high-
purity systems, such as utility boilers, which remain relatively free of particulates except under
conditions where the system may become temporarily upset.

6.6.6.2 Corrosion
The second major water-related boiler problem is corrosion, the most common example being the
attack of steel by oxygen. This occurs in water supply systems, preboiler systems, boilers, con-
densate return lines, and in virtually any portion of the steam cycle where oxygen is present.
Oxygen attack is accelerated by high temperature and by low pH. A less prevalent type of corro-
sion is alkali attack, which may occur in high pressure boilers where caustic can concentrate in a
local area of steam bubble formation because of the presence of porous deposits.
Some feed water treatment chemicals, such as chelants, if not properly applied can corrode feed
water piping, control valves, and even the boiler internals.
While the elimination of oxygen from boiler feed water is the major step in controlling boiler cor-
rosion, corrosion can still occur. An example is the direct attack by steam of the boiler steel sur-
face at elevated temperatures, according to the following reaction:
4H2O 1 3Fe n Fe3O4 1 4H2
(6.6.4)
This attack can occur at steam-blanketed boiler surfaces where restricted boiler water flow causes
overheating. It may also occur in superheater tubes subjected to overheating. Because this corro-
sion reaction produces hydrogen, a device for analyzing hydrogen in steam is useful as a corrosion
monitor.
6.6.6.3 Carryover
The third major problem related to boiler operations is carryover from the boiler into the steam sys-
tem. This may be a mechanical effect, such as boiler water spraying around a broken baffle; it may
be caused by the volatility of certain boiler water scales, such as silica and sodium compounds; or
it may be caused by foaming. Carryover is most often a mechanical problem, and the chemicals

found in the steam are those originally present in the boiler water, plus the volatile components that
distill from the boiler even in the absence of spray.
There are three basic means for keeping these major problems under control. External treatment of
makeup water, condensate, or both, is performed before their entry into the boiler to reduce or
eliminate chemicals (such as hardness or silica), gases or solids. Internal treatment of the boiler
feed water, boiler water, steam, or condensate with corrective chemicals may be performed.
Control of the concentration of chemicals in the boiler water may be performed by blowdown of
the water from the boiler.
6.6.6.4 External Treatment
Most of the unit operations of water treatment can be used alone or in combination with others to
adapt any water supply to any boiler system. The suitability of the processes available is judged by
the results they produce and the costs involved. Water treatment processes include: sodium zeolite
softening, lime softening, lime softening followed by sodium zeolite softening, split stream deal-
kalization, demineralization, and reverse osmosis.
The boiler treatment program aims at control of seven broad classifications of impurities:  sus-
pended solids, hardness, alkalinity, silica, total dissolved solids (TDS), organic matter, and gases.
6.6.6.4.1 Suspended Solids
The removal of suspended solids is accomplished by coagulation/floc-
culation, filtration, or precipitation. Just about all unit processes require prior removal of solids.
For example, water to be processed by ion exchange should contain less that 10 mg/litre suspended
solids to avoid fouling of the exchanger and operating problems.
6.6.6.4.2 Hardness
A number of unit operations can remove calcium and magnesium from water,
as well as other impurities. Partial cold lime softening and complete hot lime softening are used in
most heavy industrial plants. These processes remove hardness, alkalinity, silica, and suspended
solids. Sodium exchange can be used alone or in conjunction with lime softening.
6.6.6.4.3 Alkalinity
It is desirable to have some alkalinity in boiler water, so complete removal of
alkalinity from boiler makeup is seldom practiced except in demineralization. Some alkalinity is
also needed to provide optimum pH in the feed water to prevent corrosion if piping and equipment.
The makeup alkalinity may be present as HCO3–, CO32–, or OH–. If the makeup is city water that
has been zeolite softened, alkalinity is usually in the bicarbonate (HCO3–) form; if lime softened,
it is mostly carbonate (CO32–), but the water may also contain some hydroxide (OH–). When bicar-
bonates and carbonates are exposed to boiler temperatures, they break down to release CO2:
2NaHCO3 n Na2CO3 1 H2O 1 CO2
(6.6.5)
The sodium carbonate then breaks down further to caustic:
Na2CO3 1 H2O n 2NaOH 1 CO2
(6.6.6)
The carbon dioxide gas redissolves when the steam condenses, producing corrosive carbonic acid:
CO2 1 H2O n H1 1 HCO3–
(6.6.7)
The amount of CO2 generated is proportional to alkalinity. For a given alkalinity twice as much
CO2 is formed from HCO3– as from CO32– because the bicarbonate breakdown is the sum of both
reactions 6.6.5 and 6.6.7 above. The carbonic acid is usually neutralized by chemical treatment of
the steam, either directly or indirectly through the boiler, to produce a condensate pH in the range
of 8.5 to 9.0. Reduction of feed water alkalinity is desirable, then, to minimize CO2 formation and
reduce chemical treatment costs.
The hydroxide produced by the breakdown of HCO3– and CO32– is beneficial for precipitation of
magnesium, to provide a good environment for sludge conditioning, and to minimize SiO2 carry-
over. However, too high an excess of caustic can be corrosive, particularly if localized concentra-
tion can occur. The breakdown of HCO3– is complete, but not all the CO32– converts to caustic. The

conversion varies from one boiler to another and increases with temperature. As a general rule, at
600 lb/in2 65 to 85% of boiler water alkalinity is NaOH, the remainder being Na2CO3. (This is
based on the equilibrium in the cooled sample of boiler water).
The degree of alkalinity reduction is therefore dictated by boiler water control limits and steam
quality goals. The best unit process for alkalinity reduction may be chosen for the other benefits it
provides as well as its efficiency in alkalinity reduction
6.6.6.4.4 Silica
The permissible concentrations of silica in boiler water at various operating pres-
sures are given in Table 6.37. Silica reduction is not always necessary, especially in the absence of
a condensing turbine. Low concentrations of silica can be sometimes produce sticky sludge in low-
pressure boilers treated with phosphate. A makeup treatment process may be selected to provide
just the proper degree of silica reduction required by the steam system.
6.6.6.4.5 Total Dissolved Solids
Some treatment processes increase dissolved solids by adding solu-
ble byproducts to water; sodium zeolite softening increases solids by adding an ion (sodium) hav-
ing a higher equivalent weight (23) than calcium (20) or magnesium (12.2) removed from the raw
water. Processes to reduce dissolved solids achieve various degrees of success. Usually, reduction
of dissolved solids is accomplished by a reduction of several individual contaminants.
6.6.6.4.6 Organic Matter
Organic matter as a general classification is only a qualitative term. It
includes a wide variety of compounds that are seldom analyzed as specific materials. Problems in
boiler systems attributed to organic matter have often been traced to organic materials from plant
processes in returned condensate, rather than makeup water contaminants. However, in higher
pressure utility systems, organic matter is the major impurity in makeup and can result in forma-
tion of organic acids.
6.6.6.4.7 Dissolved Gases
Degasifiers are commonly used to remove gas mechanically rather than
chemically. Blower types are used for CO2 removal at ambient temperatures following acid or
hydrogen-exchange units. Vacuum degasifiers provide the same extent of CO2 removal, but also
reduce O2 to less than 0.5 to 1.0 mg/litre, offering corrosion protection, especially if the vacuum
degasifier is part of a demineralizing system. Steam-scrubbing degasifiers, call deaerating heaters,
usually produce an effluent free of CO2 with O2 concentrations in the range of 0.005 to 0.01 mg/litre.
Direct reaction of this low residual with catalyzed sulfite, hydrazine, or hydrazine substitutes (all-
volatile oxygen-reducing compounds) eliminates O2 completely to prevent preboiler corrosion.
6.6.6.5 Condensate Returns
In addition to makeup treatment, acceptable feed water quality may require cleanup of condensate
to protect the boiler system, particularly if there is process condensate containing oil. Boilers

requiring high-quality demineralized water also demand high-quality condensate. Some plants
operate both high- and low-pressure boilers; high-quality feed water for the high pressure boilers
may be provided entirely by a demineralizer, with lower quality condensate segregated for return
to the low-pressure boilers.
Septum filters are usually selected for oily condensate treatment. A cellulose type filter aid
(processed wood pulp) is applied both as a precoat and a body feed. The temperature should be less
than 93°C (200°F) to avoid degradation of the filter aid. Anthracite filters precoated with a floc
produced from alum and sodium aluminate are also effective. However, the pH of the condensate
must be controlled in the range of 7.0 to 8.0 to avoid solubilizing the alumina floc. Condensate con-
taminated with corrosion products and inleakage of hard water is cleaned up through specially
designed, high flow rate sodium exchangers. They have been used to process condensate at tem-
peratures up to 149°C (300°F). One serious limitation of the simple sodium exchanger is its abil-
ity to pick up neutralizing amines such as morpholine (present in the condensate as morpholine
bicarbonate) and exchange this for sodium. This causes excessive use of amines, but a more seri-
ous problem arises if the condensate is returned to a high-pressure boiler where the presence of
sodium may be objectionable in deterioration of steam quality. Special regeneration procedures
would then be needed.
6.6.6.6 Internal Treatment
Scale formation within a boiler is controlled by one of four chemical programs: coagulation (car-
bonate), phosphate residual, chelation, or coordinated phosphate.
6.6.6.6.1 Coagulation Program
In this process, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or both are
added to the boiler water to supplement the alkalinity supplied by the makeup, which is not soft-
ened. The carbonate causes deliberate precipitation of calcium carbonate under favorable, con-
trolled conditions, preventing deposition at some subsequent point as scale. Under alkaline
conditions, magnesium and silica are also precipitated as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium
silicate. There is usually a fairly high concentration of suspended solids in the boiler water, and the
precipitation occurs on these solids. This method of treatment is used only with boilers (usually
firetube design) using high-hardness feed water and operating below 250 lb/in2 (17 bars). This type
of treatment must be supplemented by some form of sludge conditioner. Even with a supplemen-
tal sludge conditioner, heat transfer is hindered by deposit formation, and blowdown rates are
excessive because of high suspended solids. Coagulation programs are becoming obsolete as pre-
treatment systems become more common and competitive with the high internal treatment cost.
6.6.6.6.2 Phosphate Program
Where the boiler pressure is above 250 lb/in2, high concentrations of
sludge are undesirable. In these boilers, feed water hardness should be limited to 60 mg/litre, and
phosphate programs are preferred. Phosphate is also a common treatment below 250 lb/in2 with
soft makeup.
A sodium phosphate compound is fed either to the boiler feed water or to the boiler drug, depend-
ing on water analysis and the preboiler auxiliaries, to form an insoluble precipitate, principally
hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. Magnesium and silica are precipitated as magnesium hydroxide,
magnesium silicate (often combined as 3MgO?2SiO2?2H2O), or calcium silicate. The alkalinity of
the makeup is usually adequate to produce the OH– for the magnesium precipitation. Phosphate
residual programs which produce high suspended solids require the addition of a sludge condi-
tioner/dispersant. Because these programs restrict heat transfer, owing to the deposition of calcium
and magnesium salts, precipitation programs of this type are often replaced with solubilizing treat-
ments such as chelants and polymer/dispersants.
6.6.6.6.3 Chelant Programs
A chelate is a molecule similar to an ion exchanger; it is low in molec-
ular weight and soluble in water. The sodium salts of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and
nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) are the chelating agents most commonly used for internal boiler treat-
ment. These chelate (form complex ions with) calcium and magnesium. Because the resulting com-
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

plex is soluble, this treatment is advantageous in minimizing blowdown. The higher cost compared
to phosphate usually limits the use of chelates to feed waters having low hardness. There is the risk
that breakdown of the organic molecule at higher temperatures could create a potential problem of
control that could result in corrosion, so chelate programs are usually limited to boilers operating
below 1500 lb/in2 (100 bars). The addition of polymers as scale control agents increases the effec-
tiveness of chelate programs. It also reduces the corrosion potential by reducing the chelant dosage
below theoretical requirements, so that there is no chelant residual in the boiler water.
Chelates can react with oxygen under boiler water conditions, which can increase the cost of a
chelate program substantially. Overfeed of chelates and concentration mechanisms in the boiler can
lead to severe localized corrosion and subsequent unit failure.
6.6.6.6.4 Coordinated Phosphate Program
In high-pressure, high heat transfer rate boilers, the inter-
nal treatment program must contribute little or no solids. The potential for caustic attack of boiler
metal increases with increasing pressure, so free caustic alkalinity must be minimized. The coor-
dinated phosphate program is chosen for these conditions. This differs from the standard program
in that the phosphate is added to provide a controlled pH range in the boiler water as well as to
react with calcium if hardness should enter the boiler. Trisodium phosphate hydrolyzes to produce
hydroxide ions:
Na3PO4 1 H2O n 3Na1 1 OH– 1 HPO42–
(6.6.8)
This cannot occur with the ionization of disodium and monosodium phosphate:
Na2HPO4 n 2Na1 1 HPO42–
(6.6.9)
NaH2PO4 n Na1 1 H1 1 HPO42–
(6.6.10)
The program is controlled by feeding combinations of disodium phosphate with trisodium or
monosodium phosphate to produce pH without the presence of free OH–. To successfully control
a coordinated phosphate program, the feed water must be extremely pure and consistent quality.
Coordinated phosphate programs do not reduce precipitation; they simply cause precipitation of
less adherent calcium phosphate in the absence of caustic. A dispersant must be added to condition
deposits that would otherwise reduce the heat transfer rate. The coordinated phosphate program
was first developed for high-pressure utility boilers, and most experience with this program has
been gained in this field.
6.6.6.6.5 Complexation and Dispersion
The newest addition to internal treatment technology is the
use of synthetic organic polymers for complexation and dispersion. This type of program can be
used to 1500 lb/in2 (100 bars) and is economical in all low-hardness feed water systems typical of
those produced by ion exchange. Heat transfer rates are maximized because these polymers pro-
duce the cleanest tube surfaces of any of the available internal treatment programs. This treatment
solubilizes calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, and maintains silica in solution while avoiding
corrosion potential side effects as determined by hydrogen levels in the steam. Iron particulates
returned from the condensate system are likewise dispersed for removal via blowdown. A simple
measure of ion transport is used to demonstrate on-line performance of this program.
6.6.6.6.6 Program Supplements
In addition to controlling scale and deposits, internal treatment must
also control carryover, defined as entrainment of boiler water into the steam. Boiler salts carried
as a mist may subsequently deposit in the superheater, causing tube failures or deposit on the blades
of a turbine. They may also contaminate a process in which the steam is used. Because a high per-
centage of carryover is caused by foaming, this program is usually solved by the addition of an
antifoam agent to the boiler feed water.
Sludge in boiler water may settle to form deposits, which are as serious a problem as scale.
Chemicals are used to condition boiler water particulates so that they do not form large crystalline
precipitates; smaller particles will remain dispersed at the velocities encountered in the boiler cir-
cuit. At lower pressures both the coagulation and phosphate residual programs incorporate sludge

403

conditioning agents for this purpose. A variety of natural organic materials are used, including
starches, tannins, and lignins.
At intermediate pressures, chemically reacted lignins have been widely used, though synthetic
polymers are replacing them. At pressures up to 1800 lb/in2 (120 bars), heat-stable polymers such
as anionic carboxylates and their derivatives are used as effective dispersants. An alkaline envi-
ronment generally increases their effectiveness. Lignin-type dispersants and other natural organic
derivatives are being replaced by these more effective synthetic organic polymers. These disper-
sants have been designed for specific dispersion problems, with tailored molecules for magnesium
silicate, calcium phosphate, and iron particulates being available.
Somewhat related to carryover, in that steam quality is affected, is the discharge of contaminants
that volatilize under boiler operating conditions. The major volatiles are CO2, created by the break-
down of carbonate and bicarbonate mentioned earlier, and SiO2. Although the CO2 can be neutral-
ized, it is prudent to reduce feed water alkalinity to minimize its formation. For all practical
purposes, external treatment for silica reduction and blowdown are the only means to avoid exces-
sive SiO2 discharges for protection of turbine blades. Hydroxyl alkalinity helps reduce silica
volatility.
Oxygen is the chief culprit in boiler systems corrosion. Deaeration reduces the oxygen to a low
concentration in the preboiler system, but does not completely eliminate it. Application of sulfite,
hydrazine, or hydrazine-like (all-volatile) compounds after deaeration scavenges the remaining O2
and maintains a reducing condition in the boiler water. An advantage of hydrazine is that it is dis-
charged into the steam to become available in the condensate as protection against oxygen corro-
sion in the return system. If oxygen is present, ammonia can attack copper alloys in condensers and
stage heaters. The removal of NH3 by external treatment may be necessary. The corrosive aspects
of CO2 have already been mentioned in relation to condensate systems. The beneficial and detri-
mental aspects of NaOH in the boiler circuit in relation to corrosion control have also been dis-
cussed earlier.
6.6.6.7 Blowdown
Boiler feed water, regardless of the type of treatment used to process the makeup, still contains
measurable concentrations of impurities. In some plants, contaminated condensate contributes to
feed water impurities. Internal boiler water treatment chemicals also add to the level of solids in
the boiler water.
When steam is generated, essentially pure H2O vapor is discharged from the boiler, leaving the
solids introduced in the feed water to remain in the boiler circuits. The net result of impurities
being continuously added and pure water vapor being withdrawn is a steady increase in the level
of dissolved solids in the boiler water. There is a limit to the concentration of each component of
the boiler water. To prevent exceeding these concentration limits, boiler water is withdrawn as
blowdown and discharged to water. Blowdown must be adjusted so that the solids leaving the boiler
equal those entering and their concentration is maintained at the predetermined limits. Of course
it is apparent that the substantial heat energy in the blowdown represents a major factor detracting
from the thermal efficiency of the boiler, so minimizing blowdown is a goal in every steam plant.
One way of looking at boiler blowdown is to consider it a process of diluting boiler water solids by
withdrawing boiler water from the system at a rate that induces a flow of feed water into the boiler
in excess of steam demand.
There are two separate blowdown points in every boiler system. One accommodates the blowdown
flow that is controlled to regulate the dissolved solids or other factors in the boiler water. The other
is an intermittent or mass blowdown, usually from the mud drum or waterwall headers, which is
operated intermittently at reduced boiler load to rid the boiler of accumulated settled solids in rel-
atively stagnant areas. The following discussion of blowdown will be confined only to that used for
adjusting boiler water dissolved solids concentrations.

Blowdown may be either intermittent or continuous. If intermittent, the boiler is allowed to con-
centrate to a level acceptable for the particular boiler design and pressure. When this concentration
level is reached, the blowdown valve is opened for a short period of time to reduce the concentra-
tion of impurities, and the boiler is then allowed to reconcentrate until the control limits are again
reached. In continuous blowdown on the other hand, the blowdown valve is kept open at a fixed
setting to remove water at a steady rate, maintaining a relatively constant boiler water concentra-
tion. Because the average concentration level in a boiler blown down intermittently is substantially
less than that maintained by continuous blowdown, intermittent blowdown is less efficient, more
costly, than continuous blowdown.
It is common to express blowdown as a percentage of feed water. However, this may give the util-
ities engineer a false sense of security. If the plant has 80% condensate return and 20% makeup, a
5% blowdown would appear satisfactory, but it indicates that the makeup is being concentrated
only four times; of the four units of makeup entering the boiler, one unit is being thrown away.
Perhaps that is as much usage as can be made of that particular quality makeup, but the operator
should be aware of it.
Because the main purpose of blowdown control is to reach the maximum permissible concentra-
tions for best boiler efficiency without exceeding concentrations that would harm the system, the
first step in developing a blowdown control program is to establish allowable limits. The conven-
tional limits recommended to provide boiler cleanliness and adequate steam quality should be fol-
lowed. These limits cover most situations encountered in industrial boiler operations, but not the
coagulation treatment used in low-pressure boilers. With the coagulation treatment, total dissolved
solids are usually limited to 3500 mg/litre, and adequate alkalinity is maintained to provide the car-
bonate for calcium precipitation and the hydroxide for magnesium precipitation. These levels can
be established only after the nature of the makeup treatment system has been considered.
The limits on such things as total dissolved solids, silica, and alkalinity are basically related to the
amounts of these materials entering the makeup water; these concentrations can be adjusted by
blowdown and also by some adjustment in the makeup treatment system if that flexibility is pro-
vided. On the other hand, such constituents as phosphate, organics, and sulfite are introduced as
internal treatment chemicals, and their concentration can be adjusted both by blowdown and by rate
of application.
6.6.6.8 Contaminants in Returned Condensate
With increasing use of demineralized water, even
for intermediate pressure boilers (600 to 900 lb/in2), the major impurities in the feed water are no
longer introduced by the makeup water but rather by the returned condensate, principally as
corrosion products.
These corrosion products are not solubilized by chelates and are difficult to disperse. If they
deposit, boiler salts may concentrate under them because they are relatively porous and permit
boiler water to enter with only steam escaping. This may lead to caustic attack. To prevent this,
boilers should be cleaned at a set frequency.
The likelihood of alkalinity attack is increased by variable loads and firing conditions, which cause
flexing and cracking of the normal dense magnetite film on the boiler metal, exposing fresh metal
to attack.
In forced circulation boilers, there is a tendency for deposits to form on the downstream side of
flow control orifices. To avoid this, feed water should be free of deposit-forming material, espe-
cially corrosion products, so that a chemical program can be applied successfully. Condensate pol-
ishing may be required since the condensate is the source of the corrosion products. Steam
separators are essential to production of acceptable steam, and their deterioration will depreciate
steam quality.
Boilers are often damaged by corrosion during out-of-service periods. Idle boilers are very vul-
nerable to attack when air contacts moist metal surfaces. To prevent this corrosion, the boiler metal
must be protected by either keeping the surfaces completely dry or by excluding all forms of air

from the boiler by completely filling it with properly treated water. Because of variations in boiler
design, there is no single, detailed procedure that covers all steps in boiler lay-up, including both
chemical and mechanical aspects. The basic principles in protecting boilers against corrosion are
simple.
There are two basic ways of laying up boilers:  wet and dry. In storing a boiler dry, trays of mois-
ture absorbing chemicals, such as quicklime, are distributed on trays in the boiler drum (or drums)
and the boiler is sealed. The alternate method, wet storage, involves forcing air out of the boiler by
completely filling to overflow with water which has been specially treated. Nitrogen gas under
slight pressure can also be used to displace air and blanket the boiler surfaces. Special considera-
tion must be given to protecting superheaters during lay-up, particularly, the non-drainable type.
The choice between the wet and dry methods of lay-up depends to a great extent on how long the
boiler is to be out of service. Dry lay-up is preferable for long outages; the wet method has the
advantage of permitting the boiler to be returned to service on reasonably short notice. It is a good
idea to drain, flush, and inspect a boiler prior to any lay-up. When times does not permit this, the
boiler may be stored wet without first draining it. In this case, the chemical treatment for lay-up,
including catalyzed sulfite, caustic, and organic dispersants, is injected into the boiler just before
it comes off-line.
6.6.6.9 Condensate Return Systems
Condensate produced when steam is used in any kind of process is seldom cooled measurably
below the steam temperature. Because it is hot, close to the steam temperature, the collection sys-
tem and piping used to handle it must be carefully selected. The piping is generally larger than that
used for cold water because pressure drop will cause steam to flash from the flowing condensate,
choking the pipe and restricting flow. Condensate may be picked up by a pump for boosting to the
best point of return, or it may be delivered to a point of lower pressure simply by the pressure
gradient.
Turbine condensate is normally collected in a hotwell, and a level is maintained in the hotwell so
that the pump transferring the turbine condenser to the deaerator will have adequate net positive
suction head. The level in the hotwell is maintained by returning some of the pump discharge,
depending on load fluctuations.
Process condensate is also usually returned by pumps to the deaerating heater. Condensate
receivers collect the process condensate and maintain level control so that the pump handling the
hot condensate will have adequate suction head. Even so, special designs of centrifugal pumps are
usually required for handling hot condensate. Stage heater condensates are normally handled by
gravity, returning to a lower pressure stage heater, the deaerator, or even the condenser hotwell.
Once the condensate has been collected, the proper point of return must be decided upon. In the
utility station, the entire flow of condensate may be polished through some type of ion exchange
system before being returned to the deaerating heater. In industrial plants, if the condensate is con-
taminated it will be sent to a treatment plant before returning to the deaerator. For the most part,
condensates are returned to the deaerating element itself, as they may contain dissolved oxygen and
other gases; however, high-pressure returns free of dissolved oxygen may be sent directly to the
storage section of the deaerating heater to flash and supply steam for the deaerating operation.
For the most part, the condensate handling system is of ordinary carbon steel construction,
although pump impellers, valve trim, and heat exchange tubes are usually of copper alloys.
Because the condensate is usually hot, if corrosive agents are present the rate of corrosion will usu-
ally be greater than what would be expected in cold water. The principal agents of corrosion are
carbon dioxide and oxygen. The CO2 is normally produced by the breakdown of alkalinity in the
boiler and the oxygen may be drawn into the system by inleakage of air or of water containing dis-
solved oxygen (pump sealing water, for example). Inspection of the condensate piping provides a
good clue as to the cause of corrosion. The principal cause of corrosion of copper alloys is ammo-
nia in systems containing O2.

Without adequate treatment of the steam, the pH of condensate would normally be low because of
the presence of carbon dioxide. The application of volatile alkaline amines will control attack by
neutralizing carbonic acid, thus raising the pH value of the system. In a tight system, the neutral-
izing amine is often adequate for the complete corrosion control program. However, many systems
are operated intermittently or under throttling (flow-restricting) conditions where oxygen inleak-
age can occur. At these higher levels of oxygen, neutralization is inadequate as the sole protective
measure against corrosion of steel piping. In such cases, volatile filming amines are added to the
stream, which upon condensation produce a waxy substance on the metal and provide a barrier
between the flowing condensate and the pipe wall so that corrosion cannot occur.
Hydrazine and other all-volatile oxygen scavengers may be used both for pH correction and oxy-
gen scavenging, but it becomes uneconomical when high levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen
occur, a common condition in most industrial operations.
In plants where gross contamination occurs, the source and cause should be located and corrected.
An example of such an occurrence is the use of steam for producing hot water through a heat
exchanger. The industrial operation may require hot water at a specific temperature, 150°F for
example, and a thermostatic element is installed in the water line to regulate the steam flow into
the heat exchanger according to water flow and exit temperature. At low water flows where the
steam demand is low, the steam admission valve may be so fully throttled that there is actually a
vacuum in the vapor space. Most of these systems are designed for pressure operation, and under
vacuum, air leakage is common. If a neutralizing amine is used in a system of this kind, it may be
easy to locate inleakage of this sort because the air in the industrial atmosphere will contain enough
CO2 to drop the pH of the condensate at that particular point. Thus, a way to find the source of air
inleakage in a complex industrial plant is to sample condensate at all sources and compare the pH
of the sample condensate with the pH of a condensed steam sample or a sample of condensate
known to be free of atmospheric contamination.
Where the attack of copper alloy has been found to be caused by ammonia, filming inhibitors will
usually prevent further attack by preventing O2 from reaching the surface. If the ammonia concen-
tration is high, reduction of ammonia in the pretreatment system should be considered.
6.6.6.9.1 Neutralizing Amines
The most commonly used neutralizing inhibitors are amines such as
morpholine, cyclohexylamine, and diethylaminoethanol. The ability of each product mentioned to
enter the condensate or water phase is indicated by its vapor-to-liquid distribution ratio, Table 6.38.
This ratio compares the concentration of amine in the vapor phase to the concentration in the water
phase.
In order to neutralize carbonic acid, the amine must be present in the water phase. The distribution
ratio indicates the preference of an amine for the water phase or the vapor phase. An amine such
as morpholine, preferring the water phase, will be present in the initially formed condensate at high
temperatures. On the other hand cyclohexylamine tends to remain with the steam to enter the con-
densate as the temperatures decrease.
Because of their differing vapor-to-liquid distribution ratios, two or more such amines may be used
together to provide the effective neutralization programs for complex systems.

Neutralizing amines are fed to the feed water after deaeration, boiler steam drum, or steam header.
They are controlled by monitoring the returned condensate pH from samples taken at the begin-
ning, middle, and end of a condensate system.
6.6.6.9.2 Filming Inhibitors
Inhibitors used to film condensate systems are amines with chain-like
molecules. One end of each molecule is hydrophilic (loves water), and the other end hydrophobic
(hates water). The hydrophilic end attaches to the metal, leaving the other end to repel water. As
the molecules accumulate, the surface becomes non-wettable. The film, therefore, provides a bar-
rier against metal attack by water containing carbon dioxide, oxygen, or ammonia. Because the
molecules also repel each other, they do not tend to build up layers or thick films. Instead, they
remain a monomolecular protective film.
A film one molecule thick actually improves heat transfer in condensers, dryers, and other heat
exchange equipment. By promoting dropwise condensation, an insulating water film between the
water and metal surface is prevented.
Good distribution of filming inhibitors is of prime importance in preventing condensate corrosion.
Protection depends on the maintenance of a continuous film. Because steam and condensate can
wash away the film, it must be constantly repaired by continuous feed of the inhibitor.
Octadecylamine and certain of its salts were the first chemicals to be used as filming inhibitors in
steam-condensate systems. However, because of their wax-like nature (whether supplied in flake
or emulsion form), it was difficult to put these chemicals into uniform solutions for feeding. A rel-
atively narrow condensate pH range of 6.5 to 8.0 is required for the octadecylamine to form a film
and to remain on the metal surface. To overcome these limitations molecules formulated specifi-
cally for boiler plant conditions have been developed as alternatives to octadecylamine.
Most filming inhibitors are normally fed to the steam header, but may be fed to the feed water or
boiler drum; the latter feed points result in some loss of product to blowdown. If only the process
equipment needs protection, the inhibitor may be conveniently fed into the desuperheating water at
the process steam header. Regardless of the feed point, however, the inhibitor should be fed con-
tinuously for best results. Dosages are not based on oxygen or carbon dioxide content of the steam.
The amount of inhibitor required is set according to the system surface area. Creation of an effec-
tive film is a physical process, highly dependent on flow rates, feeding, and testing techniques.
6.6.6.10 Evaluating Results
There are several good ways of determining how much corrosion is occurring in a system and how
effective a prevention program is. Because this requires extensive monitoring, it is essential that
sampling be done at the significant points of the system and with adequate facilities. There must
be a quill installed in the line that projects into the flowing stream; a sample taken along the pipe
wall is meaningless. Sample lines must be of stainless-steel tubing.
6.6.6.10.1 pH Monitoring
This involves checking the pH throughout a system, necessary to make
sure that:  sufficient amine is being fed to neutralize carbon dioxide, the proper amine is used to
give total system protection, and process contamination or air inleakage is not occurring.
When taking condensate samples, to avoid carbon dioxide flashing off and giving false results, the
sample must be cooled prior to contact with the atmosphere. This means using a sample cooler
attached to the condensate line. The sample may be throttled at the outlet but not at the inlet. This
is done to prevent a vacuum from occurring in the coil and drawing in air, which will give false
results. Failure to set up a cooler properly will give inaccurate and misleading results.
6.6.6.10.2 Conductivity Monitoring
The conductivity of the returning condensate can be an indicator
of process contaminants and corrosion.
6.6.6.10.3 Carbon Dioxide Testing
By actually measuring the carbon dioxide content of the conden-
sate, the problem of corrosion from carbon dioxide can be directly monitored.

6.6.6.10.4 Hardness
Similar to conductivity measurement, this can be an indicator of process con-
taminants, particularly from cooling water leakage.
6.6.6.10.5 Test Nipples
The use of test nipples, installed in steam or condensate lines, permits both
visual inspection of system conditions and a measure of corrosion.
6.6.6.10.6 Test Coupons
These have also been used to evaluate condensate corrosion conditions.
Preweighed coupons in holders are inserted into condensate lines. After an arbitrary time interval
(usually at least 30 days), the coupons are removed, cleaned, and reweighed. The difference in orig-
inal and final weight, when coupon surface area and exposure time are known, gives an indication
of rate of metal loss owing to corrosion. It should be noted, however, that such test coupons usu-
ally cannot identify bottom grooving and threaded-joint corrosion as they occur in actual piping.
6.6.6.10.7 Iron and Copper
Testing for corrosion products (iron and copper) in condensate is a pre-
ferred and widely used means of observing corrosion trends. Because metal corrosion products in
condensate are mainly present as insoluble particulates rather than in dissolved form, methods of
sampling that insure representative and proportional collection of particulates are important.
A general level of corrosion products in the 0–50 mg/litre range indicates the system is in control.
Because of the problem of sampling error when looking for this small quantity of particulates, a
relatively large amount of sample needs to be run. Two accepted methods used are visual estima-
tion and quantitative measurement.
Visual estimation of iron concentration is based on the relative degree of discoloration of a mem-
brane filter through which a known volume of condensate is passed. Estimation is made by com-
paring the membrane pad, after filtration of the sample, with prepared standard pads having color
equivalents for specific iron values.
Very precise quantitative determinations of total iron and copper values are easily made by the
Analex method. In this procedure, a sample stream of condensate is allowed to flow through a
small plastic cartridge containing a high-purity filter of ion exchange materials for a period of 7 to
30 days. Particulates are captured by filtration, while dissolved solids are retained by ion exchange.
By a unique laboratory process, the total weight of each metal is calculated. A series of successive
analyses gives a complete and accurate picture of condensate corrosion trends. Normally, when
inhibitors are used in a system previously untreated, the corrosion products observed in the con-
densate will increase temporarily. Most inhibitors have a detergent effect and tend to slough off old
oxides. This must be taken into consideration when evaluating test results.
Normally a plant uses more than one of the above  monitoring methods (e.g. pH monitoring and
corrosion coupons). Although it may seem inconvenient when initially setting up a program to
monitor the condensate, the results are more than worth the time invested in avoiding downtime
and gaining energy savings in the high-heat value and high-purity of the returned condensate.
6.6.6.11 Steam Sampling
The most difficult sampling is of the steam itself as a representative sample is hard to obtain with-
out making special provisions for it. The ASTM recommended procedure for sampling steam and
condensing this for analysis should be followed. The analysis may only require a determination of
pH to establish the level produced by the application of a neutralizing amine as a benchmark for
interpreting the pH of samples of condensate. On the other hand, steam sampling is extremely valu-
able as a means of locating sources of trouble in a system.
Hydrogen analysis of steam will help determine boiler corrosion rate with respect to steaming load.
Hydrogen evolution results from active corrosion cells or chemical decomposition. Experienced
consultants should conduct these tests so that correct interpretations can be made. The corrosion
action within the boiler can be easily observed on the hydrogen analyzer chart; destruction of the
protective film of magnetite produces hydrogen directly from the attack of the boiler steel.

A common method for determining steam quality is by use of the specific ion electrode for sodium.
As the salts dissolved in the boiler water are sodium salts, the presence of sodium in the steam sam-
ple is a direct indication of carryover. A trained steam purity consultant should be contracted.

7.1 Introduction
Pre-treatment of hot metal is the adjustment of the composition and temperature of blast furnace
produced hot metal for optimal operation of the oxygen converter process; as such, it is one of the
interdependent chain of processes that constitute modern steelmaking1, Fig. 7.1. When taken to the
extreme case, the converter process function is reduced to scrap melting and carbon reduction sub-
sequent to the prior removal of silicon, phosphorus and sulfur in preparatory steps under thermo-
dynamically favorable conditions. An important benefit of removing phosphorus and sulfur from
the hot metal prior to the oxygen converter process is the ability to produce steels with phospho-
rus and sulfur contents lower than otherwise achievable without severe penalty to the converter
process. Silicon removal is beneficial to the converter to reduce the chemical attack on the basic
refractory lining and to allow the use of only minimal amounts of slag-making fluxes, thereby
maximizing process yield.
Hot metal pre-treatment by North American and European steel producers presently is focused on
desulfurization due to the common use of relatively low phosphorus containing iron ores.
In a unique approach to pre-treatment, ISCOR, in South Africa, installed a hot metal mixer
equipped with channel inductors to provide electrical energy to heat the liquid, and thereby raise
the scrap melting capability of the steel plant.
Details of the process steps introduced above are provided in the following sections.
7.2 Desiliconization and Dephosphorization Technologies
The introduction of oxygen converter technology in Japan occurred at a time of limited availabil-
ity of high quality scrap, and, as a result, the desire was to minimize the use of this expensive
resource. Steel production was focused on the use of controlled, prepared raw materials. The tech-
nologies developed for the efficient removal of silicon and phosphorus from the hot metal, both
fundamentally endothermic when carried out using the customary oxide reagents, provided an eco-
nomic benefit by consuming chemical energy otherwise available for melting scrap in the con-
verter. By 1983, a large number of pre-treatment facilities were in use, Table 7.1.2,3
Initially, these pre-treatment processes were performed by adding iron ores or sinter to the hot
metal4 during its flow in the blast furnace runner. Further improvements and control over chemical

results were attained4–8 by the addition via subsurface injection of the reagents in dedicated ves-
sels, such as oversized torpedo or submarine cars. This brought on the use of a variety of chemical
reagents, including soda ash (sodium carbonate), which also provides for significant removal of
sulfur. When using iron oxides for desiliconization, it is essential to separate, i.e., remove, the
process slag before the hot metal is desulfurized as this operation requires low oxygen potential for
efficient performance. It is important to recognize that phosphorous removal occurs only in hot
metal containing less than 0.15% Si, additionally, phosphorus held in the slag could be subject to
reduction, i.e., reversal, into the hot metal if it were present during desulfurization. An interesting
technical development was the combination of dephosphorization and desulfurization in a single
vessel whereby5 phosphorous is reacted with the oxidizing reagents as they rise in the liquid and
sulfur is removed by the top slag in the vessel, Fig. 7.2.
Desiliconization and dephosphorization are accompanied by losses of carbon from the hot metal
and evolution of CO2 from carbonate reagents.4 Thus, control strategies such as addition of coke
breeze9 or equipment accommodations must be made in the reaction vessel and gas capture sys-
tems to contain foaming and flame evolution. In the recent timeframe, environmental considera-
tions over disposal of sodium-containing slags has forced the use of limestone based reagents,
often mixed with iron ore or sinter fines and delivered with oxygen, the latter used to diminish the
thermal penalty from the pre-treatment process. Oxygen consumption in these process steps is
illustrated in Fig. 7.3.

In some plants, the silicon and phosphorus removal steps occur in full size oxygen converter ves-
sels and the resulting carbon containing liquid is transferred, after separation of the low basicity
primary process slag, into a second converter, Fig. 7.4, for carbon removal by oxygen top blow-
ing.4,7 In this sequence, the slag from the second vessel is used as a starter slag for the first step.
In a way, this is todayís equivalent of the former open hearth process, which provided for flushing
of the initial silica and phosphorus rich slag and thus allowed the use of hot metal made from phos-
phorus bearing ores for production of what was then considered low phosphorus steels.
7.3 Desulfurization Technology
7.3.1 Introduction
“…sulfur is frequently found in metallic ores, and, generally speaking, is more harmful to the met-
als, except gold, than other things. It is most harmful of all to iron…”, so wrote Agricola four and
one half centuries ago.10 From ancient times, through puddling furnaces and into blast furnaces,

the control and elimination of
sulfur has been a major task for
the steelmaker. The cost of sulfur
is enormous. In its simplest form,
a modern coal to steel flow sheet
involves separating more than
99% of the sulfur dug out of the
ground at the coal pits. To control
the 11 kg/ton of sulfur con-
tributed by the coal and other
feedstocks, the typical steel plant
spends over $5/ton of steel in
addition to capital charges for
equipment and exclusive of
processes for sulfide shape con-
trol in the steel product.
In the oxygen driven converter
operation, the heavily oxidizing
environment of the metal and
slag and the inability to attain the
equilibrium sulfur partition ratio
between slag and metal limit the
sulfur removal capability of the
process. Thus, to bring the sulfur
content of the steel to within the
range manageable by the far
more costly steel desulfurization,
the lower cost hot metal treat-
ment technologies have been
developed to remove sulfur prior
to the oxygen steelmaking step.
Initially these technologies were used to help the steelmaker, but, in time, it was recognized11 that
significant cost savings and production increases in ironmaking would result if sulfur limits for-
merly imposed on the blast furnace operation were lifted. In most North American steel plants, the
hot metal leaves the blast furnace containing 0.040%–0.070%S, while the oxygen converters are
charged with hot metal containing as little as 0.010%–0.001%S, to conform to limits on steel com-
position set by caster operations and final product quality requirements.
The importance of sulfur management and the huge costs involved have led to worldwide efforts
to develop and implement an array of different desulfurization technologies. The different reagent
and delivery systems in use are the result of local economic and environmental factors and the pref-
erences of technical and operating management at the individual plant sites.
The following sections address the main chemical reactions for sulfur removal from hot metal, the
range of process permutations, the specifics of reagent delivery systems, the importance of reaction
vessel selection and of slag management issues as these topics bear on a well-functioning system.
7.3.2 Process Chemistry
The variety of process permutations adopted worldwide depend on one or a combination of the fol-
lowing reactions:

Initially, most plants relied on reaction 7.3.1, that is, the addition of soda ash (Na2CO3) at the blast
furnace cast house or at the steelworks while filling iron transfer ladles. This approach was aban-
doned as process control and environmental management were very difficult. In Europe and Japan,
mechanical stirrers (KR) were introduced into the blast furnace runners12, Fig. 7.5, and later for
use in hot metal transfer ladles13, Fig. 7.6. In the U.S. and Canada, the next step was dependent on
reaction 7.3.2 with the use of Magcoke (a product made by filling the pores of coke with magne-
sium and submerging this material into the hot metal in a sequence of multiple dunks). Results
were reproducible11, but, attainment of sulfur contents of less than 0.020% was costly in reagents
and process time. Capture of the copious magnesium fumes was nearly impossible without total
building evacuation.

The chemical behavior of magnesium in hot
metal has been the subject of extensive study14,
Fig. 7.7. It is important to realize that the solu-
bility product of Mg and S is strongly dependent
on temperature (Fig. 7.8) and silicon and carbon
content of the iron. This results in improved sul-
fur removal, or the reduced need for magnesium
for colder iron. The practical effect is to lessen
the cost penalty of having to load relatively cold
hot metal with magnesium for attainment of sul-
fur levels lower than 0.002%S. An interesting
technical side effect of the increase in solubility
of magnesium in hot metal at low sulfur levels,
e.g. near 10 ppm S, is the observation that some
magnesium appears to be oxidized from the iron
as soon as the raker blade clears the surface of
slag. The effect is noticeable as a light white
fume even after emptying the transfer ladle into
the steelmaking vessel. Sampling has shown the
plume material to consist mostly of MgO.

A critical step in process development was adoption of subsurface pneumatic injection of calcium
carbide powder15 (reaction 7.3.3) and of pulverized lime16 (reaction 7.3.4) or combinations, i.e.,
mixtures, of pulverized magnesium and lime (reaction 7.3.5). Because calcium carbide is inert, it
is difficult to distribute it throughout the liquid; to improve on this, one of two reagents is added
(,15–20%) to create surface and stirring: limestone, which cools the liquid or diamid lime, which
is less endothermic. The latter version, known as CaD, was developed by SKW in Germany. 
An important improvement came in the development of co-injection technology17:  the controlled
mixing in the transport line of reagents supplied separately, Fig. 7.9. This technique, now in uni-
versal use, allows for a wide array of reagent combinations and permits independent adjustment of
the rates of the delivery of the reagents during the process, Fig. 7.10. This is most useful for mag-
nesium based systems wherein splash and fuming during lance insertion and removal can be kept
to a minimum by starting and stopping magnesium reagent flow with the lance tip at the deepest
immersion in the hot metal. Another advantage is that the rate of delivery of the magnesium can

be reduced at low sulfur levels when low
magnesium solubility limits its dissolu-
tion in the iron18, Fig. 7.11. Co-injection
affords a cost benefit by allowing the user
to purchase the individual components
from the least costly material supplier
rather than being solely reliant on a sup-
plier for a proprietary mixture. A further
benefit over blended reagent mixtures is
elimination of segregation (i.e., separa-
tion) of individual reagent components14
with differing size or density while the
mixture is in transit or in storage.
Although in Europe and Canada carbide
based systems had been favored for a
number of years, several European shops
also have adopted co-injection for lime
and magnesium. In another variant, car-
bide and magnesium are used in combination by co-injection.16 For a fixed magnesium feed rate
(splash limit) carbide + Mg is faster than lime + Mg. In the CIS countries14, magnesium granules,
coated with passivating layers of salts, have been in use with delivery by subsurface injection.
Several North American plants22 have also used this reagent in the past, but environmental con-
cerns and limited supply have eliminated it from current use. In Japan, with environmental con-
straints on the disposal of slags containing residual amounts of calcium carbide, reagent systems
based on vigorous stirring of lime and soda based reagents (KR process, Fig. 7.6) have been used
successfully. The benefit of intense hot metal reagent mixing is demonstrated in one plant where
the spent desulfurization slag from a shop equipped for conventional injection treatment is used as
the main reagent in a shop using the KR process.23 Recently, environmental concerns (in Japan) on
disposal of soda slags has brought on adoption of lime plus magnesium systems.24–26
A variant to the use of reactive agents like calcium carbide and magnesium is the use of lime pow-
der either preceded by addition of aluminum27–29 to the hot metal (reaction 7.3.6), or lime deliv-
ered with organic stirring agents such as natural gas16, 30 and/or solid hydrocarbons.31 The latter,
used as ground solid hydrocarbons, has been adopted to improve mixing even for magnesium based
reagents. With the use of aluminum, CaO?Al2O3 globules form which have a large solubility for
sulfur.32 Recently, in the U.S., desulfurization by injection of prefluxed 2CaO?Al2O3 has been
introduced with some commercial success (reaction 7.3.7). Although these reagents have lower unit
cost that carbide or magnesium, there is a limitation shared with lime systems; the greater mass of
reagent needed increases the time required for treatment and for the follow on raking step.
Two other methods for delivery of desulfurization agents into hot metal transfer ladles are worthy
of note. One approach, paralleling the use of cored wires for steel ladle treatment, is to feed mag-
nesium cored wire33 at high rates to reach the ladle bottom for release of the reagent at maximum
depth. Magnesium in this form is far costlier than as an injectable solid, albeit the delivery system
is simpler to operate and maintain. Another approach, with somewhat larger implementation34,35,
known by the commercial name ISID, consists of feeding the reagents through a rotatable bayonet
system installed low in the wall of the hot metal transfer ladle, Fig. 7.12. Maintenance concerns
and cost have limited broad implementation of this technology.
7.3.3 Transport Systems
Delivery and use of pulverized desulfurization reagents, e.g. magnesium, lime, calcium carbide,
entail distinct technological requirements, principally the avoidance of contact with air.
Magnesium powder, produced by atomization or grinding, must be transported in sealed, air-tight

containers of limited capacity (20,000 kg each). Thus, to provide the capability to move this mate-
rial in bulk, the industry developed a 90% Mg–10% lime product that is flowable and can be deliv-
ered and stored in bulk trailers. Calcium carbide also must be kept from the moisture in air and is
transported and stored in bulk, sealed, pneumatic system equipped trailers. Salt-coated magnesium
is relatively impervious to moisture and generally is stored in bulk trailers as well.
An important adjunct to facilitate the use of pulverized materials such as lime and calcium carbide
has been the development of a technology for improvement of the flowability of these materials by
application of silicone oil based flow aids during pulverization.36 Powders prepared in this manner
can be delivered by dense phase injection techniques, which minimize the amounts of reagent and
iron droplets carried out of the liquid by the transport gas (e.g., for lime, transport line loading of
2 kg/l of gas). This allows delivery of injection reagents at rates of 50 kg/min through an 18mm
transport line.
7.3.4 Process Venue
When the pneumatic delivery of reagents was first introduced in the 1970s, these processes were
relatively time consuming, i.e. 20 to 30 minutes, and the task was relegated to be carried out in
torpedo cars. This resulted in interference from slag reactions as the ever present high sulfur blast

furnace slag can cause sulfur reversals in the case of carbide based reagents. Furthermore, the post-
reaction slags are viscous and stick to the roof and sides in the submarine fleet, reducing holding
capacity.37 Over-treatment was the rule as the submarine ladles were treated some time prior to
their arrival at the melt shop and the coordination of their use for an intended product order.
Most shops changed to transfer ladle treatment to resolve these issues. The hot metal carrying
capacity of the submarine fleet increases due to elimination of slag build ups on the sub roofs37
and refractory wear is reduced, Fig. 7.13. Other problems associated with submarine ladle treat-
ment include relatively poor mixing caused by the shape of the elongated bottle configuration and
the relatively shallow liquid depth. In the BOF transfer ladle, reagent efficiency of magnesium is
increased by the greater depth of lance immersion, which provides longer residence time for the
magnesium bubbles to travel to the surface. The major benefit of treatment in the transfer ladle
rather than in the submarine ladle is that it provides the opportunity to treat individual hot metal
charges to specific sulfur levels set by the requirements of the intended steel grade.
7.3.5 Slag Management
As in all metallurgical processes, management of the slag produced during hot metal desulfuriza-
tion is critical to success. After conclusion of treatment, the slag usually is removed with a raking
device, which typically is an articulated arm and paddle assembly. The raking process requires
some time which may become a production penalty in some operations. Process yield suffers as
some hot metal is lost from the ladle with each stroke of the paddle. In some shops, the iron trans-
fer ladle has a retention dam across the mouth with hole(s) for the metal to pour out. The slag is
retained in the ladle as the hot metal is charged into the furnace. While effective at separating the
slag and minimizing yield loss, this may slow the rate of charging the vessel and, therefore, extend
the converter heat cycle. Additionally, the slag retained in the ladle must be dumped after each use;
as this is done by reversing direction (to keep the pour holes open), this step may create difficul-
ties in some shops.

During raking the post-treatment slag will take with it a significant metallic content (approximately
40% by weight)38, this can represent a yield loss of nearly 1%. Methods to minimize this loss
include the use of dense phase injection (to minimize the volume of gas for delivery of the injected
powders), and the addition of a fluxing agent, ,5% CaF2 or Na2CO3 to the desulfurizing reagents,
to produce a less viscous liquid slag for release of the iron globules. A further help is to provide a
small amount of gas bubbling39 (Fig. 7.14) during the raking process; this promotes flotation of
the slag towards the lip of the ladle and thereby reduces the number of strokes required for slag
removal.
Typical figures for slag removal are in the range of 15—25 kg/ton hot metal for most U.S. shops.
Two viscosity related factors combine to make the quantity of slag raked from transfer ladles
dependent on hot metal temperature16, Fig. 7.15:  colder hot metal appears to “hold” more entrained
blast furnace slag and the retention of iron droplets in slags increases as temperature drops. The
trend shown in Fig. 7.15 is typical for most BOF shops. Disposal of the spent slag usually is by
mixing it into the blast furnace slag management system despite the remaining unused sulfur hold-
ing capacity.23 In some plants special controls are in place to cope with the effect of remaining
unreacted reagents such as carbide or soda ash. This is not an issue with magnesium or lime.
7.3.6 Lance Systems
Fig. 7.16 illustrates the commonly used injection lance designs. Nozzles may be directed vertically
or exit the side of the lance at various angles. Typical life experience is 80 treatments or up to 1200
minutes for the hockey stick design, which prevents the reactive gases from attacking the refrac-
tory coating. A lower figure, 70 treatments, is typical for the simpler lazy L lances.

Lances typically are constructed of lengths of square steel tubing which contain the transport
pipe(s). These assemblies are then cast within a refractory mold and cured in temperature con-
trolled drying ovens. The cross sectional shape may be square or round with an area of 40–50 cm2
(6–8 in2). The refractory typically is high alumina.
A recent development directed at increasing the injection rate of magnesium containing combina-
tions, without causing otherwise intolerable violence at the surface of the metal in the transfer
ladle, is to use two transport lines contained within a single lance each fed by a separate injection
materials source. The outlet nozzles are positioned to deliver the reagent at 30° from the vertical
on opposite sides of the lance. It is also possible to use two separate lances immersed into the metal

at the same time. These approaches have reduced injection time by 40,50% without increasing
iron losses to the ladle slag or reduction in reagent efficiencies. 
7.3.7 Cycle Time
In a typical BOF shop, the hot metal treatment operation can become a limit on productivity. Pour-
out and movement of the submarine ladles may require five to ten minutes. Injection time will con-
sume seven to twenty minutes, depending upon the amount of sulfur to be removed, followed by
raking time of five to ten minutes. 
7.3.8 Hot Metal Sampling and Analysis
Hot metal sampling and
analysis is a critical issue, par-
ticularly for magnesium re-
liant systems, because time
must be provided for removal
by flotation of the MgS reac-
tion product. Best repro-
ducibility in results is obtained
when the post-treatment sam-
ple is obtained after the raking
step is completed19, Fig. 7.17.
Similarly, gas stirring systems
installed to aid the raking
operation30, Fig. 7.14, can
result in improved sampling
accuracy as both the pre-and
post-treatment samples are
made more representative.
The method for determination of endpoint sulfur is, in part, a function of the precision required at
the individual melt shop and other operating considerations. Gas combustion methods (Leco) and
optical emission spectrometers (OES.) are used commonly. Many shops have these instruments at
the treatment sites for rapid determination of results. 
Optical emission spectrometers have demonstrated sufficient precision for determination of ppm
concentrations of sulfur in hot metal provided the disk samples obtained for analysis are sound and
prepared properly. Pits, holes and cracks will affect the results, as will surfaces with improper tex-
ture and/or flatness. OES determination has the advantage of providing silicon and manganese
analysis for use in the furnace charge model—-a significant benefit when erratic blast furnace
operations result in varied hot metal chemistry.
The gas combustion method is recognized as probably the most accurate for determination of sul-
fur (and carbon) due to ease in achieving appropriate sample integrity. Prevention of process slag
entrapment in the pin sample is the greatest concern. Properly designed immersion samplers
inserted quickly to sufficient depth will provide slag-free samples. The latest Leco C–S determi-
nator is advertised to have a precision of 0.15 ppm.
7.3.9 Reagent Consumption
Reagent consumptions for lime plus magnesium and carbide plus magnesium process systems are
illustrated in Fig. 7.18. Control of powder flowability and rates is critical for achievement of these
consumption levels. It is essential to avoid excess transport gas and/or visible magnesium flares or
powder plumes.

7.3.10 Economics
Fig. 7.19 presents a breakdown of the cost components
for a typical transfer ladle hot metal desulfurization
operation.
7.3.11 Process Control
Modern facilities are generally fully automated to con-
trol the operation from the start of treatment to finish.
Powder initiation and lance insertion are automatically
controlled along with lance withdrawal after the prede-
termined amount of reagent has been injected. Reagent
rates may be adjusted during treatment by controlling
injection tank pressure or transport line throat diame-
ter. In addition to the automatic functioning, the con-
trolling computer provides for process data capture
and storage. Real-time graphics provide information
on process efficiency and dispenser performance to
aim standards. Typical, for a well-controlled operation,
is to achieve within 0.002%S of aim at end points
ordered <0.003%S.
7.4 Hot Metal Thermal Adjustment
A one-of-a-kind facility to heat hot metal has been installed by ISCOR in South Africa.40,41 The
1500 ton hot metal mixer, Fig. 7.20, is equipped with channel inductors which provide induction
heating and stirring of the liquid. Options for use are (a) to melt scrap in the unit by energy addi-
tion to the hot metal or (b) to raise the hot metal temperature and thereby improve the scrap melt-
ing capability of the converter. Superheat of 225°C (440°F) for a 40% scrap rise increase is
achievable. Electrical energy conversion for temperature gain has been reported41 as 85%. Whereas
technically successful in performing its functions, the capital cost of such a system, in contrast to
the scrap melting benefit obtainable with chemical energy sources, has made this approach unat-
tractive for other steel plants.

8.1 Introduction
The intent of this chapter is to provide a mechanical description of the basic oxygen furnace
(BOF), as well as the maintenance of certain BOF components. The components covered in this
report include basically all components of the BOF vessel and the trunnion ring up to the trunnion
pins. Excluded areas are probes, couplings, bearings, foundations and the various drive units. The
BOF components covered are:  top ring and lip ring; cone, barrel, bottom shells and transition
knuckle sections or flanges; brick retainer rings, slag shields and taphole assembly; working and
safety refractory linings; vessel support system; trunnion ring, trunnion blocks and trunnion pins;
cooling system for the vessel or trunnion ring; and oxygen lances.
This chapter is an abridged version of AISE Technical Report No. 32, Design and Maintenance of
Basic Oxygen Furnaces,1 with the addition of Section 8.5 which addresses oxygen lance design,
and Section 8.6 which addresses sub-lance design.
8.2 Furnace Description
8.2.1 Introduction
This chapter is established to provide a description and preliminary design considerations for the
manufacture and supply of BOFs. Basic oxygen furnaces are so called by virtue of the refractory
and the additives used in their steelmaking processes. The processes referred to in this chapter are
those which involve the treatment of a mixture of steel scrap and molten iron, generally trans-
ported from the blast furnace to the BOF. The steel scrap and hot iron are charged into the BOF
vessel and oxygen is injected in one of many different methods into the furnace for purposes of
producing a steel melt of specific chemical and physical properties.
The processes involved share one common operating factor; the injection of oxygen into the fur-
nace is the agent for decarburizing the molten hot iron and generating the reaction heat required
to melt the scrap.

For purposes of this chapter, the terms used will be consistent with the following descriptive defi-
nitions. A BOF installation consists of the basic oxygen furnace, furnace support foundation, fur-
nace tilt drive and controls, furnace water cooling system, fume exhaust and cleaning system,
oxygen injection system, auxiliary furnace bottom stirring system, process additives system, scrap
and hot metal charging system, molten steel delivery and slag disposal system, furnace deskulling
system, and other auxiliary steelmaking requirements such as sampling, refractory inspection and
relining systems, process computers, etc.
An operating BOF, Fig. 8.1, consists of the vessel and its refractory lining, vessel protective slag
shields, the trunnion ring, a vessel suspension system supporting the vessel within the trunnion
ring, trunnion pins and support bearings, and the oxygen lance.
The BOF vessel consists of the vessel shell, made of a bottom, a cylindrical center shell (barrel),
and a top cone; reinforcing components to the cone, such as a lip ring and top ring; auxiliary cen-
ter shell and top cone flanges for bolted-on top cones; auxiliary removable bottoms for bottom
reline access, or for individual bottom reline of bottom-blown vessels; and a taphole. This list is
not intended to be either restrictive or comprehensive, e.g., top cone flanges are not universal.
BOF vessels can be one of the general classifications presented in Fig. 8.2. These are top-blown
vessels, in which the oxygen is injected above the hot metal bath by means of a retractable lance;
top-blown vessels, in combination with bottom stirring, the latter usually by introducing metered
amounts of inert gas at specific locations under the hot metal bath—the introduction of the inert
gas is either through porous plugs or tuyeres; bottom-blown vessels, in which the oxygen is
injected under the molten metal bath through tuyeres arranged in the bottom of the vessel, and usu-
ally carrying pulverized additives; bottom-blown vessels utilizing a calculated source of heat
energy provided by hydrocarbon fuel, in a very similar arrangement as the bottom blown vessel;
and combination-blown vessels, in which the oxygen is introduced under the bath through tuyeres

in the bottom of the vessel, as well as above the bath through a lance—the oxygen blown through
the bottom usually carries pulverized additives. Fig. 8.3 presents commercially available bottom
stirring processes.
8.2.2 Vessel Shape
The shape of the vessel has an influence on the efficiency of the steelmaking process inside. This
is particularly the case when the oxygen to the steel bath is supplied only from the top (top blow-
ing). Fig. 8.4 shows a variety of shapes and sizes which were used in North America during the

period of 1954–1973. Although many factors would influence the shape of the vessel, an approxi-
mate rule of thumb which has yielded favorable designs relates to the specific volume of the ves-
sel. In conjunction with the rate of oxygen blowing, Fig. 8.5, and with hot metal composition as
controlling factors, operating experience has shown that in general when the specific volume is in
excess of 26 cubic feet per net ton of processed steel, Fig 8.6, the yield loss due to slopping is
highly reduced.
Except for the case of a greenfield site installation, the optimum vessel shape for the particular
application is usually determined by factors other than the oxygen blowing efficiency. The height
clearance and the distance between trunnion pin bearing centers are two common factors which
limit vessel volume increase in a vessel replacement project.
8.2.3 Top Cone-to-Barrel Attachment
There are generally two methods for the attachment of the top cone of a vessel to its cylindrical
section, namely welding or bolting. Welded top cones can be either corner welded or welded with
a rounded knuckle. In each case, the inside surface of the shell must be free from offsets because
of stress concentrations. Corner welded transitions are more susceptible to cracking than rounded
knuckle transitions.
Bolted top cones, on the other hand, necessitate outfitting both the cone and the top of the cylin-
drical center section with adequately heavy flanges and elevated temperature-resistant bolts and
nuts.
The taphole on BOFs built in the U.S. has been placed mostly in the cone section. The centerline
of the taphole usually falls on the intersection of the refractory linings of the top cone and the cylin-
der. In vessels with a top cone knuckle, most of the tapholes fall partly within the knuckle area. In
other countries, there are numerous vessels where the tap nozzle is actually located in the top cylin-
der of the center shell. This is done to utilize the properties of the molten steel flow which are asso-
ciated with the angle of the tapped molten steel jet, the ferrostatic head, and the control of the

vessel movement during the tapping sequence. This results in improved ladle yield through reduced
entrainment of slag in the steel tapped into the ladle.
8.2.4 Methods of Top Cone Cooling
Two components in the top cone of a basic oxygen furnace vessel can benefit from water cooling
as a means to maintain their low operating temperature. These are the conical shell itself and the
lip ring at the top corner of the cone. At full combustion, these components are exposed to radiant
heat reflected back from the BOF exhaust fume hood while the furnace is in the oxygen blow
mode. Additionally, they are subjected to convective heat from the vessel interior and radiant heat
during tapping and slagging off into the steel ladle and the slag pot, respectively. Experience in a
majority of steel mills in the U.S. indicates that the water cooling of these two components has a
significantly advantageous effect in prolonging their life.
There are different designs for achieving
the water cooling of the conical shell, all
of which utilize closure channels for
forced circulation of given amounts of
cooling water. The design differences are
in the pattern of flow based on the
arrangement of the channels, and their
cross-section. The wetted area, as a per-
centage of the total conical shell area,
plays a significant role in the amount of
heat removed. It is possible to create a
cooler than desirable cone refractory,
which could contribute to the generation
of large skull buildups and kidneys
inside the cone.
One design type consists of horizontally
oriented channels, Fig. 8.7, mostly half-
pipes, feeding from and returning into
adjacent vertical inlet and outlet headers,
respectively. Another design type con-
sists of vertically oriented channels, Fig.
8.8, fed by a series of circumferentially
placed inlet and outlet headers in a pat-
tern of upward and downward flows cov-
ering the entire surface of the top cone
shell. The channels in this type would be
either half pipes or equal-legged angles.
Water circulation is maintained by forc-
ing the cooling water to the lip ring,
either through series or a parallel con-
nections. Most often series connections
are used. More flexibility in shutting off
individual systems is provided where
both the cone and the trunnion ring have
their own individual cooling water cir-
cuit, controlled from outside the vessel.
In rare occasions, a combination
between the two systems has been used,
whereby the orientation of the cooling
channels was helical. In each case, the

flow has to be carefully calculated to result in a sufficient water velocity, such that the temperature
of the water in the individual channels does not exceed the boiling point. Drains must be provided
to enable emptying the system of the contained water, and to relieve the water pressure in case of
emergency. Additionally, provisions should be made to allow for venting of the system.
A development which has been recently marketed in the industry is the air-mist cooling process
which incorporates the use of a system of sprays, Fig. 8.9. Atomized water droplets are applied to

in the sprays is controlled by thermocouples which are applied to the top cone shell.
Lastly, with the application of high conductivity magnesia–carbon bricks, the necessity of cooling
the barrel section also becomes evident. To meet this need some plants operate air cooling systems.
In these systems compressed air is routed through the trunnion pin to panels located between the

vessel shell and the trunnion ring. Air nozzles on the panels distribute the air uniformly over the
barrel surface.
8.2.5 Vessel Bottom
The vessel bottom design is influenced by the process and the weight balance required to optimize
the tilt drive system. The common shape is torispherical. For processes requiring the introduction
of gases from the bottom of the vessel (through tuyeres), the shape of the bottom tends to be flat-
ter than those which have only top blowing. Also, because some bottom stirring/blowing processes
pose more of a burden on the bottom refractory, the bottom is designed to be interchangeable to
enhance relining. For example, in the OBM (Q-BOP) process, the refractory lining in the bottom
of the vessel wears more than twice as fast as that in the rest of the vessel. Therefore, the bottom
is replaced at mid-campaign. This also allows for the maintenance of the tuyeres.
Interchangeable bottoms also allow for relining of the whole vessel from underneath through the
bottom hole.
8.2.6 Types of Trunnion Ring Designs
For the basic intended function, the design shape of a trunnion ring normally is circular, Fig. 8.10.
In such a design, the vessel and trunnion ring are assembled once for the duration of the useful life
of either or both. In certain melt shops, the logistics of operation and maintenance have demanded
the assembly and disassembly of the vessel to and from the trunnion ring for refractory reline pur-
poses. The design of the trunnion ring to satisfy this type of service is usually in the form of a
horseshoe, that is open-ended, to allow the ease of vessel removal and reassembly. However, cir-
cular rings have also been designed for exchange of vessels.
Structurally, the trunnion ring is designed to accommodate the types of load to which it is subjected
by the specific method of vessel suspension. In any given design, certain sections of the trunnion
ring are subject to shearing forces, bending moments, internal pressure, and/or torsion and to ther-
mal stresses due to non-uniform temperature distribution between the ring inside and outside diam-
eter and the top and bottom flange. Thermal loads must be considered for trunnion ring design,

even in the case of water-cooled rings. The design, therefore, should provide the necessary sizing
of the components and manner of assembly (welding, etc.) which can accomplish the required
integrity.
The cross-section of the trunnion ring is usually rectangular in shape, made up of top and bottom
flanges, inner and outer wrapper plates, and inner baffles and diaphragm plates suitable to the
design. In water-cooled and non-water-cooled trunnion ring designs, accesses are normally pro-
vided, and are located on the outside wrapper plate.
The bearing shaft or pins are normally connected to the trunnion ring via cast or fabricated blocks
which are integral parts of the ring. These pins are secured to the ring either by shrinking fitting,
welding, or bolting. Other design specifics in the trunnion blocks stem from process needs such as
bottom blowing or stirring, slag detecting and stopping, cooling, etc.
8.2.7 Methods of Vessel Suspension
Virtually all commercially available BOF designs utilize the basic concept of supporting the ves-
sel by the trunnion ring. The function of the trunnion ring is to support the vessel at all phases of
operation, while allowing it to undergo the thermal expansion necessitated by the process within.
As will be discussed in more detail, there is a multiplicity of technically workable vessel suspen-
sion system designs, and several are commercially available and industrially tested.
With the exception of a greenfield site installation, not all designs can befit the application.
Usually, the limitations arise in the confined space within which the vessel system has to be
installed. If the replacement vessel system requirement also carries with it the need for an increase
in the heat size, the problem is further magnified. Fortunately, with the advent of better design
methods (e.g., finite element analysis) and materials, these particular design needs can be met.
There are basically two methods to support the vessel by the trunnion ring. In some designs, the
vessel rests on the trunnion ring, and in others, it hangs from it. Until the late 1970s, the most pop-
ular vessel suspension design in North America was that involving support brackets. The number
of brackets used to support the vessel load was a function of the design concept used. Because of
the operating and maintenance limitations which the industry has come to realize with bracket sup-
port systems, there is now some inclination toward the concept of hanging the vessel from the trun-
nion ring. To better identify the features of the commercially available and industrially proven

systems, the following is a description of such, without any intent to commercially or technically
discredit any design. It should further be emphasized here that these suspension systems are cov-
ered by various patents and should not be regarded as public domain.
8.2.7.1 Bracket Suspension Systems
During the 1960s and 1970s, most designs in the U.S. employed the multi-bracket system which
incorporated a certain degree of redundancy in load support. When the design involves more than
three support brackets, the load distribution among the brackets cannot be accurately predicted.
Examples of multi-bracket support systems are shown in Fig. 8.11 and Fig. 8.12. In all bracket
design systems, the vessel rests on the trunnion ring. Tilting of the vessel is affected by some form
of connection between the vessel and the trunnion ring, some using the same securing mechanism
between the bracket-to-trunnion ring while others would have a separate tilt bracket.
In general, bracket suspension systems include cast or fabricated brackets attached by bolting or
welding to the vessel shell and supported at the top and bottom surfaces of the trunnion ring.
Additionally, the brackets are permitted to move radially, but restricted from lateral (tangential)
movement with respect to the supporting trunnion ring. The restriction of the tangential movement
is sometimes provided by means of stop blocks, engaged to the brackets by various systems of
keys, grooves, tapered wedges and spherical seats.
There are many designs to compensate for the inevitable longitudinal thermal expansion of the ves-
sel. Inclined planes may be located at the bottom and sometimes the top surfaces of the trunnion
rings, in the location of the brackets, such that the radial and longitudinal displacement compo-
nents of the vessel shell’s thermal expansion describe the combined inclination of the top and bot-
tom planes. Another method is to restrict the vessel top brackets from axial movement within the
trunnion ring, while allowing the bottom brackets to thermally move in the longitudinal direction
in equal magnitude to the longitudinal thermal displacement of the vessel shell between the two
brackets. In this design it becomes necessary to tie down the top brackets to the top of the trunnion
ring by such means as a gib, Fig. 8.12, which enables radial bracket displacement, while prevent-
ing the latter’s movement away from the trunnion ring.

Vessel suspension brackets, in general, induce a large mag-
nitude of a combination of localized circumferential, longi-
tudinal and twisting moments on the shell, together with
membrane and radial forces. If the vessel shell material,
geometry, plate thickness and operating temperature are such
that the applied bracket stresses could cause plastic defor-
mation and/or creep, the bracket system would then suffer
from misalignment symptoms and unequal stress distribu-
tion and would become vulnerable to high maintenance
requirements.
Geometrically stable vessel shells are the best guarantee for
the success of the bracket suspension system. Creep resisting
materials for the shell have been used successfully with
brackets. Brackets, in general, are located in areas vulnera-
ble to vessel breakouts in cases of burn-throughs. Distorted
shells or repaired brackets adversely affect the performance
of the bracket suspension system.
Bolted brackets disturb the clean surface inside the vessel
and render the bricking of the furnace difficult and time con-
suming, compared to a smooth internal vessel shell surface.
There are, however, solutions to internal surface bolt head
protrusion into the shell, which were successfully applied,
i.e., bolt heads let into a thickened strake so they are flush on
the inside.
To alleviate the load redundancy issue associated with statically undetermined multi-bracketed
support systems, some designers chose to reduce the number of supporting members to only two
main brackets, one at each trunnion pin location, to support the weight of the vessel and its con-
tents, and a third, smaller bracket for purposes of only tilting the vessel. Thus a statically deter-
mined three-point suspension system is provided.
8.2.7.2 Support Disc Suspension System
This system relies on two main circular discs protruding from the trunnion ring center of rotation
engaging into two large circular rings attached by welds and radially braced by heavy gussets to
the shell, Fig. 8.13. These guarantee the support of the vertical gravitational loads of the vessel and
its auxiliary equipment while enabling the vessel to radially and longitudinally expand without
restriction. To enable tilting the vessel without relative motion between the shell and the trunnion
ring, a third bracket called a tilting claw or toggle is attached to the vessel at a point at the cross-
axis of the vessel, supported on the trunnion ring, while a fourth member, called a guide claw, pre-
vents lateral shifting of the vessel in the trunnion ring. This member does not take any gravitational
or tilting load. The disc and ring are the supporting members, and are in permanent engagement in
all vessel tilting positions, thus avoiding shocks during tilting.
This system creates a smooth surface inside the vessel shell enhancing good and easy bricking of
the BOF. It is statically determinate, and enables calculating the precise loads and stresses applied
to both the trunnion ring and the shell. Due to the proximity of the disc to the shell, it is expected
that the bending and twisting moments can be managed from the design point of view, consider-
ing that the load is carried at only two points, compared to at least four in the case of other sus-
pension systems.
The system does not require any adjustment of components and is therefore virtually free of main-
tenance.

However, this suspension method requires a larger space between the vessel and the trunnion ring
than usually required when utilizing other suspension systems. So, it would be difficult or even
impossible to use this system in the case of a replacement BOF vessel, where the available space
is already dictated.
The cooling effect on the vessel shell by natural convection is significantly improved as compared
to other designs. Furthermore, this large space enables a future installation of an air cooling sys-
tem for the barrel section.
The disc suspension system is more vulnerable in the case of a breakout due to a burn-through, by
virtue of the large shell area required by the ring and its bracing gusset. Repairs to a damaged shell
and/or suspension system components in this area become more difficult, as the majority of that
area is inaccessible behind the trunnion ring.
8.2.7.3 Tendon Suspension System
This system relies on tying the vessel to the bottom of the trunnion ring from four single brackets
distributed circumferentially along the lower shell underneath the trunnion ring. With quick change
converters these brackets can be combined into two bracket segments. Pre-stressed (pre-tensioned)
tendons penetrate the trunnion ring and are tightened to its top to retain the vessel lower brackets
tightly in contact with the bottom surface of the trunnion ring at the point of suspension, while
allowing radial displacement of the vessel with respect to the trunnion ring, Fig. 8.14. For absorp-
tion of the vessel loads during tilting of the converter, transversal tendons are arranged underneath
(with larger vessels above and beneath) the trunnion ring in the region of the trunnion pins as
shown in Fig. 8.15. Horizontal stabilizer brackets, similar to the one shown in Fig. 8.16, are some-
times used instead of transversal tendons.
Radial expansion of the vessel shell has to overcome the friction at the supporting surfaces because
of the pre-stressed tendons.
This system also provides a clean smooth inside shell surface for easy dependable bricking of the
BOF. The largest load carrying member of the lower shell bracket is provided in generally one of

the lowest temperature shell regions. The stability of the shell, therefore, is expected to be favor-
able. The tensioning of the tendons is easy to perform with the aid of a tensioning device with
direct indication of the tensioning forces. A breakout due to a burn-through could cause difficul-
ties in repairing or replacing the lower brackets.
Experience to date shows that the system appears to require very little maintenance. Also, this sys-
tem does not occupy any additional room between the vessel and the trunnion ring than that
required by a bracket suspension system.
8.2.7.4 Lamella Suspension System
This system relies on suspending the BOF vessel from the lower surface of the trunnion ring by
means of a series of two flexible plates oriented in an inclined tangential plane to the shell,

Fig. 8.16 and Fig. 8.17. These plates, called lamellae, are separated from each other by means of a
spacer, and enable radial movement of the lower vessel shell against flexural deflection of the two
plates about their weak axes. In the direction of their own plane, they possess large strength and
stiffness. Therefore, with the aid of a stabilizer bracket between the top shell at the trunnion ring,
the system can sustain loads resulting from a tilted or inverted furnace, in addition to an upright
vessel.
This system also provides a clean smooth inside shell surface for easy dependable bricking of the
BOF. One of the positive features of this design is that the lamella load carrying bracket attached
to the lower shell is provided in the shell region of lowest temperature.
The stability of the shell, therefore, is expected to be favorable. A breakout due to a burn-through
will not cause difficulties in repairing or replacing the lower brackets of the lamellae.
Experience to date shows that the system requires very little maintenance. Also, this system does
not occupy any additional room between the vessel and the trunnion ring than that required by a
bracket suspension system.

8.2.8 Vessel Imbalance
The operation of a BOF vessel includes tilting it to either side for purposes of charging, sampling
and tapping. The drive train required for this function has to overcome the imbalance, which is cre-
ated initially by design, of the vessel about the center of rotation. Additionally, the drive mecha-
nism with associated components has to either be able to absorb or attenuate the dynamic or
transient type loads which primarily arise during tilting operations.
Two schools of thought exist in the industry regarding the nature of the imbalance in the vessel.
One concept is to design the vessel system such that at any time during its operation the imbalance
forces are self-righting. In other words, should the drive system fail to hold the vessel, it would
return to an upright position. The other concept, which is influenced by purely economic consid-
erations, is one where the vessel system at some stage in its operation becomes overturning if the
drive control is lost. The drive system in the latter concept is smaller and therefore lower in cost.
However, most of the BOF vessels have adopted the self-righting concept.
The unbalanced torque at the drive side trunnion pin results from the eccentricity of the center of
gravity of the rotating masses from the center of rotation of the furnace. The center of gravity of
the solid rotating masses, namely the steelwork, refractory and contained water, remains constant
with respect to the center of rotation, and the static torque resulting from a 360° rotation of the fur-
nace is a true sine wave. The molten masses on the other hand assume the inside configuration of
the refractory lining and under a given angle of tilt will result in a hot metal torque corresponding
to the weight of the molten masses and the location of their center of gravity. This latter property
is a function of the geometry of the molten mass. By adding the two torques, the static torques of
the solid and the molten masses, the total static torque is obtained. This is important in determin-
ing the degree of equilibrium of the vessel, and its tendency to movement from a given parked con-
dition. For that reason, the effect of both new and worn lining configurations must be considered.
Coupled with the static unbalanced torque are magnitudes of transient or dynamic torque which
can be higher than the static values, depending on the acceleration and deceleration settings in the
drive control circuitry, Fig. 8.18. While the operator would prefer a quick responding vessel for

control during the tapping process, such responsiveness usually is detrimental to the integrity of
the drive components. An acceleration/deceleration ramp time of four seconds has proven to be an
acceptable threshold for imposing the least damage on the drive components.
Uneven and/or non-symmetric refractory lining wear, coupled with skull buildups, play a significant
role in changing the vessel unbalance torque. As shown in Fig. 8.19, in one specific installation a
50% increase in static torque was experienced after the refractory lining had produced 1640 heats.
8.2.9 Refractory Lining Design
Fig. 8.20 shows the areas of the refractory lining. The BOF refractory systems are discussed in
greater detail in Chapters 3 and 4. A brief description of the requirements of each areas is presented
here.
8.2.9.1 Safety Lining
The safety lining is to be made up of burned and/or burned pitch impregnated magnesite refracto-
ries. Typical thickness of the safety lining is nine inches. Some companies prefer to use 18 inches
on the bottom of the vessel. Refractory retaining bars and rings are installed on the inside of the
shell to segment the safety lining so that, during repair, only the worn sections of refractory will
be removed and good refractory will be retained. The size and location of the refractory retainers
shall be mutually determined jointly by the user, the designer and the refractory supplier.
8.2.9.2 Working Lining
The working lining can vary in thickness depending upon the type of operation and upon the wear
rate generally experienced. Higher wear areas should have greater thickness or higher quality mate-
rials. The refractories for each area should be selected to have properties that reflect the wear mech-
anisms of the area where placed. The highest wear areas of the lining should contain brick with
properties that reflect the mechanism of wear in that area. Less severe wear areas may contain
refractories that are less resistant to the wear mechanisms of the BOF process.

8.2.9.2.1 Cone
The cone should contain refractories having good oxidation resistance and good
strength. Generally, slag resistance is not a serious consideration.
8.2.9.2.2 Charge Pad
The charge pad represents the most important mechanical impact zone. This
area is subject to impact during the charging of scrap, and it is subject to erosion during the charg-
ing of liquid hot metal. The charge pad should contain refractories with high hot strength to with-
stand the charging of scrap and hot metal. Slag resistance and oxidation resistance are also
desirable properties for charge pad brick.
8.2.9.2.3 Tap Pad
The tap pad should contain refractories that are resistant to molten steel and to
BOF slag. The oxidation resistance of these materials should also be good.
8.2.9.2.4 Taphole
Taphole refractories must have good resistance to molten hot metal erosion and
to slags. Tapholes are replaced frequently and a magnesite-based material is gunned around the tap-
hole brick to fill any holes left by the removal of the old taphole refractory. This gunning material
must also be resistant to slag attack and molten metal erosion.
8.2.9.2.5 Trunnions
Trunnion brick should possess exceptional resistance to BOF slags. Good high
temperature strength and oxidation resistance are also desirable.
8.2.9.2.6 Knuckle/Stadium
Knuckle/stadium brick should have good resistance to molten metal ero-
sion and thermal shock.
8.2.9.2.7 Bottom
Bottom brick should have good resistance to molten metal erosion, oxidation and
thermal shock, especially for bottom blown converters.
8.2.9.3 Refractory Shapes
Refractory shapes for BOF linings are generally key shapes. Certain areas of the vessel may con-
tain special shapes. The cone may contain a parallelogram shape that permits easy deskulling of
the cone early in the campaign. Also, the bottom may contain BOF key-wedge-arch shapes to
accommodate the concentric ring bottom design.

8.2.9.4 Burn-in Practice
Before a newly lined vessel system can be rotated for operation, a burn-in procedure is necessary
to heat the brick for expansion to secure it in place. The burn-in procedure consists of loading coke
and other combustible materials into the vessel, igniting them, and starting the heating procedure
by lowering the oxygen lance into the vessel. The proper burn-in procedure requires the following.
8.2.9.4.1 Time
A controlled burn-in requires 3.5 to 4 hours at a heatup rate of 500°F per hour to
2000°F to allow for a more gradual temperature adjustment of the refractory. The vessel can be
immediately charged once burn-in is complete.
Some shops still use tar-bonded magnesite refractories in the cones. These materials are normally
manufactured to withstand a slow heatup and can be burned in as described above. However, some
materials may still be available that have not been so manufactured, and in this case, they may
exhibit slumping as they are heated slowly through the temperature range of 400–600°F. The
refractory supplier should be consulted on this matter. For this latter material, a rapid heatup avoids
the slumping, and burn-in should consist of heatup to 2000°F over a time period of 1.5 hours.
8.2.9.4.2 Temperature Monitoring
Temperature during burn in should be monitored and controlled
by thermocouple. The thermocouple wire can be inserted through the taphole and should be of suf-
ficient length to reach well into the vessel. Although it will be difficult to achieve a steady state,
the rate of temperature increase should follow the desired rate as closely as possible. The initial
flare-up upon ignition will exceed the desired rate, but will fall within 30 minutes to the expected
curve. It is at this time that the blowing of the oxygen should commence and be increased to allow
the temperature to rise at the desired rate.
8.2.10 Design Temperatures
8.2.10.1 Vessel Shell Temperature
A general idea of the temperature levels which prevail in the shell are shown in Fig. 8.21. These
levels vary around the periphery of the vessel, and are influenced by the variation in refractory lin-
ing thickness.

At certain locations in the shell, the temperature level can become high enough to affect the use-
ful life of the vessel by lowering the material resistance to deformation under load. In the barrel
section, temperature levels at mid-height are usually highest, Fig. 8.22. The cooling effect from a
water-cooled trunnion ring plays a role in lowering the temperature levels in this portion of the ves-
sel. An example of such is shown in Fig. 8.23.
Designs have been worked out to provide external cooling for the shell around the trunnions. An
example of one is shown in Fig. 8.24.

The most significant benefit of external cooling on
the vessel has been on the nose cone. In addition to
maintaining or prolonging the structural integrity
of the cone, there are basically two methods of
closed system of water cooling utilized. One
method is to apply the cooling tubes in the hori-
zontal direction (circumferential flow) and the
other is to apply them along the cone generator. The
life of a non-water-cooled nose cone is usually cur-
tailed by the severe distortion which then precludes
the ability to maintain the refractory lining. While
the use of material which has higher resistance to
deformation at the elevated temperatures in the
cone can help prolong its life, the concept of water
cooling has far more advantages. Without water
cooling, the cone shell can reach temperature levels
in excess of 1000°F.
8.2.10.2
Effect of Shell Temperature on Vessel
Suspension System
The temperature distribution along and around the vessel is not uniform. This non-uniformity in
temperature, especially around the shell periphery, affects certain suspension designs more than
others. In multi-bracket suspension designs, where axi-symmetric radial expansion growth is
essential to the proper functioning of the bracket securing system, overstress problems occur in
both the suspension components and the vessel shell. Even in bracket designs where axi-symmet-
ric radial expansion is not essential, the existence of a temperature distribution other than that
assumed by design can affect the proper functioning of the support system. Yet there are suspen-
sion systems, the performance of which is much less dependent on the temperature variation along
and around the vessel.
8.2.10.3 Trunnion Ring Temperature
In the early to mid 1960s, virtually all BOF systems installed in the U.S. had dry or non-water-
cooled trunnion rings. After an average of five years most of these systems were replaced because
of severe distortion in both the vessel shell and the trunnion ring. In the early 1970s almost every
system was replaced with a water-cooled trunnion ring, allowing the useful life to be extended
threefold. While water cooling maintains the structural integrity of the trunnion ring, it also serves
to lower the temperature level of the portion of the vessel which is in close proximity to it. As is
shown in Fig. 8.23, a temperature reduction of 100°F or higher can be achieved.
The dimensional stability in the trunnion ring, which is affected by water cooling, has many merits,
among which are:  alignment of the trunnion pins is preserved; structural integrity of the suspen-
sion system, especially in the case of a multi-bracket support system, is better preserved; and a
cooled trunnion ring can be used as a reference in monitoring the permanent growth (due to creep)
of the vessel shell.
While many BOF installations utilize water-cooled trunnion rings, there are several which are still
operated dry (without water cooling). The concern and therefore the refrain from using water cool-
ing stems from the potential hazard associated with the large volume of water present in the event
of a vessel breakout.
8.2.10.4 Refractory Design Temperatures
The temperature-related destructive mechanism of refractories is slag attack—the higher the tem-
perature, the greater the slag attack. The refractory lining must be designed to withstand slag attack
at the maximum operating temperature of the furnace.

8.2.11 Design Pressures and Loading
8.2.11.1 Shell
During the operation of a BOF, the vessel shell is subjected to a complex system of loads and
stresses, some uniform and some localized, depending on the design of the trunnion ring, the sus-
pension system, and the geometrical configuration of the vessel.
In general, the loads acting on a BOF vessel shell can be categorized as:  gravitational loads,
including the weight of the steelwork, refractory lining, charge materials and residual skull
buildup; impact loads due to charging of scrap into the furnace; impact loads due to deskulling the
furnace mouth or cones, by either a floor deskuller, or mechanical means such as a pneumatic
chisel or a swung-loaded chisel; and dynamic loads resulting from vessel rotation for turndown and
tapping.
The above loads are usually transmitted to the trunnion ring and the support or suspension system
will interact, to a larger or a smaller degree, depending on the system design, with the vessel shell
at the attachment areas. Such loads are ultimately transmitted as localized bending, twisting or
membrane stresses, to the shell plate.
The following loads, on the other hand, generate vessel shell stresses usually unsensed by the out-
side support system or the trunnion ring, if the design and function of the suspension system are
not flawed. Internal pressures result from the thermal expansion of the hot refractory brick, acting
in the radial direction and the axial vessel direction—these pressures are reflected as membrane
stresses on all shell components, except at corners of cones and bottoms, where bending stresses
will result. Ferrostatic pressures are generated from the molten masses in the furnace—the effect
of the ferrostatic head is similar to that in a tilted charging ladle. Non-uniform temperature distri-
butions in the shell produce non-uniform stress loading of the shell.
A type of load which affects both the shell and the support system arises from large variations in
temperature in the shell. These large differences in temperature result from both process variations
within the vessel and non-uniform refractory lining wear. Yet another condition of significant
temperature variations develops in both the vessel shell and trunnion ring during sustained vessel
tapping.
The performance of the vessel shell under the applied loads and stresses is a function of many vari-
ables, namely:  the magnitude of the stresses and the location, area and configuration of the shell
at the attachment of the suspension system; the design, and the effect of load transmittal from the
shell to the trunnion ring; and the material of the shell, its thickness and its behavior at elevated
operating temperatures.
In North America, the experience has been that shell temperatures reach levels which affect the
long term stability under the computed acceptable levels of stresses at room temperatures. For the
same wall thickness, and correspondingly the same operating shell stresses, utilizing alternate
materials of the creep resistant variety has proved successful.
8.2.11.2 Minimum Thickness Requirement
Selection of the suitable shell thickness in a BOF vessel shell is influenced by many factors, among
which are: tonnage rating of the vessel; actual geometrical size of the vessel; particulars of design
of certain areas of the vessel shell, such as water cooling of the conical shell; physical and creep
properties of the material of the shell; nature and magnitude of loads applied from the suspension
system to the shell; thickness and type of refractory used; operating conditions and degree of wear
of refractory during the campaign; temperature of operation within the furnace; and methods of
deskulling and applied mechanical loads.
Due to the number of uncontrolled factors in operating a BOF, it will be a difficult, if not an impos-
sible, task to derive formulae to compute the above effects on the magnitude of the loads applied

to the shell, whether from the interaction with the suspension system, or from within the vessel
interior. It is anticipated that the recent investigative work, which was done and is being continued
on the analysis of the structural behavior of the BOF vessel, that the load mechanisms involved can
be better defined.2
It is for this reason that quantification of the shell thickness relies mostly on experience of the
designers and the BOF manufacturers with their particular designs and suspension systems. A sur-
vey of BOF installations shown in Fig. 8.25 provides some idea of the complexity involved in
selecting the suitable shell thickness. A similar collection of historically established dimensional
information on the design of trunnion rings is shown in Fig. 8.26.

8.2.11.3 Bottom Stirring and Bottom Blowing
The term bottom stirring means the injection of essentially inert gases into the bottom of the BOF
vessel, penetrating the bottom shell and the bottom refractory lining, under the molten bath, to agi-
tate the molten masses for such purposes as homogeneity of the melt after introducing additions in
the furnace and improving the interaction between the steel bath and the slag. There is usually no
direct chemical reaction associated with bottom stirring. The gas injection is either by means of
refractory material porous plugs embedded in the bottom lining, or by means of tuyeres, penetrat-
ing the bottom lining.
On the other hand, the term bottom blowing means injection of oxygen, singularly, with additives
(such as pulverized lime) or in addition to hydrocarbon fuels (such as natural gas, pulverized coke
or fuel oil), all routed in the same manner to initiate reactions in the bath. The injection of the oxy-
gen under the molten bath is usually done by means of tuyeres, mostly of annular design, in which
the fuel shrouds the oxygen nozzle. The preservation of the tuyere and the bottom refractory are
major objectives of the annular design.
In each case the gas lines and the fuel and additive lines (if any) are piped through one or both hol-
lowed trunnion pins of the BOF and down to the bottom shell of the vessel.
As recommended in pressure vessel design, cutting a hole in a shell requires structural reinforce-
ment. Additionally, special care shall be taken in separating the oxygen and the fuel lines. They are
usually introduced through opposite trunnion pins. The piping must take into consideration the rel-
ative displacement of the vessel with respect to the trunnion ring. Therefore, a series of expansion
joints must be designed into the piping. External protection of the piping from heat and falling
debris is required. Oxygen piping must be properly cleaned for oxygen service and must be of
stainless steel construction. If additives are injected with the oxygen, spark and abrasion resistant
materials will be required in key areas of the pipe line.
In association with bottom stirring and, to a more pronounced degree, bottom blowing, it is impor-
tant to expect generation of additional low frequency vibration in the vessel. These vibrations result
partially from the thermodynamic changes and chemical reactions encountered during the passage
of either gas in the molten bath, and the propagation of hot metal waves generated in the surface
of the bath due to the induced agitation. These oscillations will encumber (and increase the stresses
in) the shell, suspension system, trunnion ring, bearings and support pedestals and foundations.
Therefore, it is important to carefully plan for possible future process requirements when consid-
ering new BOF installations.
In top blown vessel systems, the bearing support is normally not subject to forces along the trun-
nion axis. However, in systems where gases are introduced in the vessel from the bottom or sides,
forces along the trunnion axis are developed, and if the supporting bearing pedestals and piers are
not sized properly, undesirable vibration problems result. The expansion side trunnion pin support
is normally not subject to this axial load, because the ladder bearing there allows axial movement,
without significantly resisting it. The drive side bearing support, however, has to resist these forces,
not only in terms of strength, but also dynamic compliance. Both bearing supports, however, have
to resist horizontal vibration loads acting perpendicularly to the axis of rotation.
The excitation forces in a bottom-blown or bottom-stirred system are primarily a result of the mass
motion of the molten steel inside the vessel. An example of such lateral vibration is shown in Fig.
8.27, where actual field measurements were acquired on the support system of an OBM (Q-BOP)
installation. Combined with the forces developed due to chemical reactions within, the overall fre-
quency spectrum contains many components. Coincidence of the excitation frequency of force
with the natural frequency of the vessel support system will create resonant vibration problems not
only in the support structure, but also in the vessel components.
In past installations, where vibration measurements were acquired, the frequency of axial vibration
from melt activity was in the range of 0.3–0.4 Hz. The expansion side bearing support does not
participate in resisting this horizontal force developed as a result of the melt activity in the vessel.

As a result, the magnitude of the horizontal force resulting to the drive side pier from melt activ-
ity (in the OBM or Q-BOP process) in the vessel is roughly 15% of the total weight supported by
both piers.
8.2.11.4 Creep
The useful life of a BOF vessel is normally determined by the change in the space or air gap
between the vessel and the supporting trunnion ring. Examples are shown in Fig. 8.28, Fig. 8.29
and Fig. 8.30. The permanent deformation in the vessel due to the mechanism of material creep
causes an outward growth, which reduces the air gap.
When this gap is or nearly exhausted, the vessel system is taken out of service. The stresses in the
shell which are largely responsible for this growth are due to the thermal expansion of the refrac-
tory within.

Material creep is a time related phenomenon. In steel, the mechanism is most pronounced at tem-
perature levels above 800°F. As shown in Fig. 8.31, the complete creep life cycle is composed of
three stages.
In the primary stage, large deformation or strain occurs in a relatively short time. Depending on
the material, temperature and level of stress, this period could be a matter of a few days or even hours.
In the secondary stage, the rate of strain is significantly lower, and this stage essentially represents

the useful life span of the structure. In
well designed structures, this period
normally represents many years of ser-
vice. The tertiary stage represents an
unstable region, in which the point of
rupture is not very predictable. As can
be seen, the strain rate is very high
here.
The factors which, therefore, influence
the rate of the BOF shell growth are
stress level, shell temperature level
(i.e., refractory practice), and the shell
material resistance to deformation at
elevated temperature.
Proper refractory lining design and
operating practice influence both the
stress and temperature levels devel-
oped in the shell. Material selection
for the application can serve a very
significant role here. The use of
chrome-molybdenum steel grades has
brought about a significant improve-
ment in BOF vessels in North
America. Fig. 8.32 shows the change
in strength in various BOF vessel
steels at elevated temperature levels.
8.2.11.5 Suspension System
The nature of loading on the vessel shell and the trunnion ring is a function of the specific type of
suspension mechanism incorporated.
8.2.11.6 Trunnion Ring and Pin
Again, the nature of vessel suspension influences the type of loading on the trunnion ring and in
some cases the trunnion pin.
8.2.11.7 Refractory Lining Design
BOF working and safety linings are made from standard refractory shapes. The lining has to be
strong enough to resist severe operating conditions associated with relining, burn-in and with high
temperature operation of the vessel.
8.2.11.7.1 Loading on Refractories
Loading on refractories will develop as a result of the weight of
brick courses, the weight of the cold scrap and hot metal during charging of the vessel, the weight
of liquid metal and slag during operation, and the contained pressure from the vessel shell during
refractory lining expansions.
8.2.11.7.2 Stresses in the Lining
Stresses in the lining will develop during operation and therefore
refractories must resist thermomechanical stresses caused by thermal and permanent expansion of
the lining in the horizontal directions and by the restriction imposed on the brick by the steel shell.
Linings also must withstand mechanical abuse caused by deskulling of the lip ring and the cone
and stresses caused by sudden temperature increases during burn-in of the lining and as a result of
thermal cycling between heats.

8.2.12 Method of Predicting Vessel Life
The absolute useful life of the vessel material is
limited by the time it takes to rupture under a
given stress and temperature. In the practical
sense, the useful life is limited only by the primary
and secondary stages of creep, as shown in Fig.
8.31. In the case of a BOF vessel, the practical and
useful life is determined or measured by the deple-
tion of the air gap between the vessel and the trun-
nion ring. One method, which has been commonly
used in the industry, is to periodically monitor this
air gap change and predict the end of the vessel
life using a straight line projection.
Rarely do BOF vessels deform symmetrically
with respect to the central or vertical axis. In some
systems, the deformation or distortion occurs
along the charge to tap axis and in others along the
trunnion axis.
Schematically, therefore, the common distortion
in the BOF vessel is in the form shown in Fig.
8.33. Using the anticipated or measured changes
in the vessel, the total creep strain which the
material at the tap and charge side would or has
undergone can be evaluated in one of many
approximate methods.
Documented creep data is normally provided in the form of strain rate at the test temperature and
stress levels. As indicated earlier, for steel, the information is usually developed at temperature lev-
els above 800°F. Test data also include the total strain at which rupture occurs, again for the spe-
cific temperature and stress levels.
For an estimated circumferential (hoop) stress level, coupled sometimes with the mechanical
stresses resulting from suspension loads, and the average operating temperature level of the shell
in the trunnion ring area, a strain rate can be determined from the data established for the shell
material. An example of such data is shown in Fig. 8.34 and Fig. 8.35. If the projection of the

remaining useful life is being made for a vessel system which has already been put in service, a
better method of establishing the strain rate would be to use the recorded permanent shell growth.
8.2.13 Special Design and Operating Considerations
8.2.13.1 Protective or Slag Shields
Certain components of the vessel–trunnion ring system require protection from the relatively hos-
tile environment resulting from the oxygen blowing process. In general, the suspension system
components require protection. The air gap provided between the vessel and the trunnion ring is
protected with slag shields. These are segments of steel, usually bolted to supports on the cone, and
serve the function of covering the top of the trunnion ring including the mentioned air gap. There
are other forms of protective shields designed to suit the particular concept of suspension.
8.2.13.2 Skull Buildup and System Stability
The effects of the refractory lining wear and skull buildup in altering the unbalance torque in the
tilt drive are discussed in Section 8.2.8. What is to be emphasized here are the necessary measures
which should also be taken to provide for the unusual loading on the vessel suspension, which may
not have been anticipated, such as if the user decides to use a skull cleaning system which puts
undue loads on the vessel system parts. Deskulling systems which incorporate stationary blades
mounted on the charge floor can induce unusually high loads on the vessel system if not used with
discretion.
8.2.13.3 Taphole Slag Detection and Retention
Many attempts have been made over the past decade or so to retain the slag in the BOF vessel dur-
ing tapping. The concept of a floating ceramic ball or a pyramid, Fig. 8.36, has worked well in some

shops but not others. The basic principle involved is to drop a floating stopper in the bath prior to
tapping and let the stopper plug the taphole from inside the vessel after all the steel is tapped out,
while retaining all the slag. The specific density of the stopper material is made such that it floats
on the molten steel but not the slag. A modified version of such floating stoppers shaped in the
form of a dart has found better performance in shops where a special machine was designed to
position the stopper at the taphole from inside the vessel, Fig. 8.37. Usually, BOF shops with ade-
quate floor space on the tap side appear to have the most success with such systems, as this design
then allows the installation of the proper machinery and, thus, the precise placement of the float-
ing stopper.
Another concept of slag retention which has come into use over the last fifteen years is a pneu-
matic device which is installed at the taphole on the outside of the vessel. An electromagnetic slag
detector actuates a stopper which closes the taphole after all the steel is tapped. An example is
shown in Fig. 8.38. With this system the stream emerging from the taphole is cut by the dynamic
impact of the gas blown into the taphole. Sealing performance does not depend on taphole wear.
8.2.13.4 Bottom Blowing
Bottom blowing injection devices, practices and gases differ from one shop to another. The refrac-
tories in the area where bottom stirring devices are located should be very high quality magnesia–
graphite brick with graphite contents of 10 to 20%. These refractories may contain fused grain. In
some cases, burned, impregnated brick designed to have excellent thermal shock resistance is used.

8.3 Materials
Materials of construction and welding consumables must be selected with due regard for the
stresses, the service temperatures, the interaction with lining materials, and the thermal and
mechanical cycling of the BOF process.
A detailed description of the specific type of steel materials, welding materials, materials testing
and refractory selections commonly used are discussed in detail in Reference 1.
8.4 Service Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Maintenance
8.4.1 BOF Inspection
Proper inspection and maintenance of a BOF is necessary to produce long life of the equipment
and a minimum of maintenance cost throughout its life.
The recommended areas for inspection do not rule out the need for inspecting other components
which may be unique to the user’s BOF design, and as stated in the Manufacturer’s Maintenance
Manual.
8.4.1.1 Frequency of Inspection
At a minimum, visual inspection of an active BOF is recommended during any operational cycle.
Physical inspection of certain areas and components is recommended during scheduled and non-
scheduled downturns. Physical inspection of all areas is recommended after each campaign or
sooner if duration of campaign exceeds regular intervals of inspection for certain areas.
The recommended frequencies are stated in the following critical areas.
8.4.1.2 Critical Areas for Inspection
The following components are recommended for inspection. The components may not be repre-
sentative of all BOFs but are intended to provide guidance in identifying the more critical areas for
inspection.
8.4.1.2.1 Lip Ring and Top Ring
The buildup of skull on the top of the vessel is to be completely
removed and the lip ring and top ring are to be checked for excessive warpage, cracks and/or loose
bolts. Any sections that are warped or cracked and can hinder the retention of the refractory in the
vessel are to be repaired and/or replaced. Any loose bolts and/or broken bolts are to be tightened
or replaced.
Skull removal and inspection or repair of these components are to be accomplished during the cam-
paign on scheduled and non-scheduled downturns as required to maintain their integrity. Complete
inspection and repair and/or replacement are to be made after each campaign.
8.4.1.2.2 Slag Shields
The slag shields are to be inspected for warpage due to heat. If this warpage
is excessive and the shields no longer protect the suspension system, nose cone cooling member,
or trunnion ring, these sections should be replaced.
Inspection, repair and/or replacement are to be accomplished during the campaign on scheduled
and non-scheduled downturns as required to maintain their integrity. Complete removal of slag
shields is to be accomplished after each campaign to facilitate inspection of the slag shield attach-
ment brackets and other components under the slag shields.
8.4.1.2.3 Tapping Nozzle
Welded shell nozzles are to be inspected after each campaign for cracked
welds and for burn-throughs. These should be repaired before placing the furnace back into oper-
ation.
Steelmaking and Refining Volume
460

Removable nozzles are to be inspected during and after a campaign to check for cracked welds,
burn-throughs and damage to the retaining lugs. All of these conditions should be repaired before
placing the furnace back in operation.
8.4.1.2.4 Bolting Flanges
The bolting flanges of a removable nose cone are to be inspected after each
campaign for cracked welds, loose or broken bolts and any warpage causing excessive gaps.
All cracked welds should be repaired. Loose bolts should be tightened and broken bolts replaced.
Excessively warped areas of the flange should be cut out and replaced.
8.4.1.2.5 Water-Cooled Nose Cone and/or Lip Ring
Any leakage that would occur during operation of
the furnace should be eliminated by either repairing or isolating the leak by means of diverting the
water through valving or through a complete shutoff.
After each campaign all water cooling components should be inspected and repaired as required.
8.4.1.2.6 Removable Bottoms
The removable bottoms on bottom-blown vessels are to be inspected
throughout the campaign for leaks in the tuyere supply piping. Any leaks are to be isolated imme-
diately and repaired.
During bottom changes the removable bottom proper and the attachment bolts or clamp-link
assemblies are to be inspected for any damage. Repairs should be made as required.
8.4.1.2.7 Refractory Retainers
Horizontal and vertical refractory retainers are to be inspected during
each safety lining replacement. Cracked welds should be repaired and any distorted or missing sec-
tions should be replaced.
8.4.1.2.8 Vessel Suspensions System Components
Every BOF is designed and furnished with a sus-
pension system to support the vessel in the trunnion ring. Many are furnished with vessel connec-
tions that are either welded or bolted to the vessel shell and are restrained to the trunnion ring with
welded blocks and tapered wedges.
During the campaign any noticed movement of the vessel in the trunnion ring or abnormal noises
observed during rotation should be investigated immediately.
After each campaign the following vessel suspension system components are to be inspected.
8.4.1.2.8.1 Vessel Shell Connections
All welds are to be inspected for cracking.
8.4.1.2.8.2 Vessel Bracket Connections
Connection bolts are to be inspected and any loose bolts are
to be tightened. Any broken bolts are to be replaced. The fit of back plates to the shell and of bot-
tom plates to the trunnion rings is to be inspected for distortion.
8.4.1.2.8.3 Retention Hardware
Retention blocks are to be inspected for attachment and for distor-
tion of machined surfaces. Adjustable retaining wedges are to be inspected for looseness and dis-
tortion. All necessary repairs and adjustments should be made in order to maintain the integrity of
the system and to prevent any damage to the shell and the trunnion ring.
8.4.1.2.8.4 Trunnion Ring
After each campaign the trunnion ring is to be checked for deformation.
The pin alignment in the main trunnion bearings is to be checked and recorded, as well as the axial
displacement of the trunnion pin in relation to the center of free bearing. Also, the position of the
trunnion pin in each trunnion casting is to be checked. Once per year, the access covers to the outer
wrappers are to be removed (after removal of water lines if the trunnion rings are water cooled) and
all internal compartments and diaphragms inspected for any cracked welds or members; repairs are
to be made as required. Before access covers are replaced, water cooling passages should be
cleaned and freed of all debris so as not to cause clogging.
8.4.1.3 Refractory Service Inspection
Service inspections of the refractory lining are necessary to insure that there are no uncontrolled
problems with the lining. The areas to be inspected include the cone, charge pad, tap pad, trunnions,

knuckle/stadium and bottom. These inspections are normally carried out visually; however, many
companies also rely on a laser lining thickness measuring instrument.
Visual inspection of the lining shall be made by the operator after each heat.
Laser readings should be obtained on a new vessel every other day. As the vessel wears, the fre-
quency of laser readings should be increased to daily. If heats known to be detrimental to linings
are made, laser readings should be made after these heats.
In addition to being useful for judging when the reline of the furnace shall take place, these mea-
surements can also provide an indication of the effectiveness of zoning practices (i.e., the practice
of installing different quality refractories in various areas of the furnace in an attempt to achieve
uniform wear rates). Among the other uses for these readings, two significant uses are to identify
operating practices that accelerate wear rates, and to help in scheduling routine maintenance of the
working lining of the vessel.
8.4.2 BOF Repair and Alteration Procedures
8.4.2.1 General
During the life of the BOF, repair and alteration by the user may be required to maintain the struc-
tural integrity of the BOF. It is important to distinguish between a BOF repair and a BOF alter-
ation.
A repair constitutes a rework of the BOF in order to maintain the structural integrity of the various
BOF components. A repair is defined as a rework of one or more components of the BOF without
deviation from the original BOF design.
An alteration can be either a form of rework in which a structural component of the BOF is
changed from the original specified geometry, or a change in the BOF operating conditions, such
as deviation from specified deskulling practices, increasing heat size, adding bottom gas blowing,
addition or deletion of cooling systems and/or slag shields or any other such process changes.
8.4.2.2 Procedure for BOF Repair
A BOF repair may be made in the field by the BOF user or his agent. To make a satisfactory repair
the following procedure is recommended:
1. The BOF user shall prepare a list of problem areas and operating restrictions.
2. The BOF manufacturer or qualified agent shall submit a rework plan to the BOF
user for review and comment.
3. If the BOF manufacturer or qualified agent agrees the user has adopted an appro-
priate repair procedure, then the user can proceed with the proposed repair.
4. Repair welding of the integral vessel and trunnion ring components shall meet the
requirements of ANSI/NB–23 Chapter III for welding, preheat and postweld heat
treatment.

8.4.2.3 Procedure for BOF Alteration
A BOF alteration may be made in the field by the BOF user or his agent. To make a BOF alter-
ation the following procedure is recommended:
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

1. The BOF user shall prepare an outline of the proposed alteration.
2. The BOF manufacturer or qualified agent shall perform a structural analysis of the
alteration consistent with the requirements of these specifications. Complete struc-
tural details and requirements shall be determined by the analysis and made avail-
able to the user.
3. Following the analysis, the BOF manufacturer or qualified agent shall prepare a
proposal which includes details of the alteration and follow the procedures recom-
mended for BOF repair.
4. In the case where the alteration is a change in the operating condition such as a sig-
nificant increase in tap temperatures or a major change in refractory types, and not
a structural alteration, the BOF user shall review the change in operating conditions
with a BOF manufacturer or qualified agent to determine the impact of the operat-
ing conditions on the structural integrity of the BOF. If necessary the recommended
alteration procedure shall be followed.
8.4.3 Repair Requirements of Structural Components
8.4.3.1 General
The BOF shall be maintained such that the structural components can function as intended in the
original design. The refractory linings shall be maintained such that the design temperatures for the
BOF shell and structural components are not exceeded during typical BOF operations.
8.4.3.2 Crack Repair
Temporary crack repair shall be made by drilling holes at the ends of crack tips. The end of cracks
shall be detected by appropriate NDE methods.
The hole drilling technique is a temporary repair used only to curtail the crack growth. When the
holes are drilled, immediate plans should be made to make a permanent repair of the crack.
Permanent crack repair shall be made by either removing the cracked section and replacing with
patch plates, or by complete gouging and grinding of the cracked section and replacement of the
removed material with weld deposits.
8.4.3.3 Vessel Shell or Trunnion Ring Wrapper Patch
The shell patch shall be made to replace severely distorted or buckled sections of the shell, as well
as any portion of the shell in which the thickness is less than 70% of the original design thickness
due to a washout (partial burn-through).
In the case of a molten metal breakout, the opening should be enlarged to a distance of three times
the plate thickness beyond the edge of the breakout. The patch and matching cut out portion of the
shell plate or wrapper plate must have rounded corners with a radius equal to or greater than three
times the plate thickness. The recommended maximum misalignment tolerance should be 25% of
plate thickness. The patch plate must be welded with butt joints attained by double bevel welding
or other means which will result in the same quality of deposited weld on the inside and outside
weld surface. To minimize weld shrinkage, the root opening between the patch plate and the cutout
in the shell plate should be minimized in accordance with sound welding practice.
The patch plate material must have a material specification number and grade equal to the origi-
nal plate material. Alternate grades can be used with guidance from the designer/builder.
Temporary or permanent patching by the use of overlapping patch plates attached with fillet welds
is not recommended.

8.4.3.4 Repair of Welds
The repair of welds is necessary when the weld strength has deteriorated due to wear, corrosion or
other causes, resulting in loss of weld dimension or due to weld cracks and other signs of weld
strength loss.
The existing weld should be removed, preferably by grinding, and replaced with a weld defined by
the BOF design.
Preheat temperatures and postweld heat treatment must be imposed based on the criticality of the
weld, the thickness of material being welded and other factors of the repair.
8.4.3.5 Refractory Maintenance
The practice of gunning, spraying, slagging, and slag splashing the refractories in a BOF is very
important to maintaining the structural integrity of the BOF components. Such maintenance helps
to protect a lining from excessive wear caused by either mechanical damage and/or corrosive
mechanisms. Maintenance also helps to effectively utilize downtime to extend campaign life.
The refractory at the mouth of the vessel needs to be maintained by spraying in order to maintain
the proper mouth opening and to protect the top ring and lip ring from being subjected to molten
metal contact during tapping and slagging operations. The taphole area must be repaired and/or
sprayed regularly in order to maintain proper thickness in this area so as not to experience burn-
throughs during tapping. Trunnions are a weak area in the vessel and spraying may be required in
these areas. In the case of a bottom blown or bottom stirred vessel, the tuyere areas must be main-
tained to prevent damage to the removable bottom and tuyeres. Any location in the refractory lin-
ing that has deteriorated either by normal wear or premature damage should be sprayed and built
up in order to alleviate vessel shell temperatures higher than designed for and possible burn-
throughs. Spraying should be in thin coats of approximately two inches, or as specified by those
qualified (such as the material manufacturer or other responsible expert). Heavy coats are likely to
fall off and not adhere to the refractory lining.
Slagging maintenance is possible on the charge pad and the tap pad. This is carried out by allow-
ing a small portion of the slag to remain in the bottom of the vessel after a heat. The vessel is then
rotated from one pad to another to place thin coatings of this slag on the pads. A shallow pool of
slag may also be allowed to remain on one or the other of the pads while the furnace lays on its
side between heats. Slag that is used for maintenance may also be treated by adding dolomite to
make it more refractory. For maximum effectiveness, slagging should be done frequently.
Techniques to slag the trunnion areas, such as nitrogen blow slag splashing, are recommended
when available.
8.4.4 Deskulling
8.4.4.1 General
External and internal deskulling is a very important operation of maintaining the BOF. Failure to
remove skull buildup can adversely affect the center of gravity of the vessel, causing unsafe oper-
ating conditions.
8.4.4.2 Gradall-Mounted Pneumatic Deskullers
This is the most effective method used as it is possible to remove the external and internal skull
buildup and, with proper operation, it does not impose extreme impact loads on the BOF components.
8.4.4.3 Floor-Mounted Deskullers
Various types of deskulling devices mounted into the floor structure on the charging side of the
vessel are used to continuously scrape the skull buildup from the nose of the vessel. These are

effective, but must be maintained so as not to cause damage to the BOF, should the scraping mem-
bers come into direct contact with the vessel during rotation. This method can cause damage to the
tilt drive gearing, trunnion bearings and suspension system from the impact loads transmitted dur-
ing deskulling.
8.4.4.4 Crane-Suspended Deskullers
Various items such as the scrap charging box, purposely designed battering rams, etc. can be used
to impact the nose of the vessel as they are suspended from the charging crane hook(s). Such meth-
ods are not recommended due to the significant damage that can occur to the tilt drive gearing,
trunnion bearings and suspension system from the impact loading.
8.4.4.5 Post-combustion
This technique can be used to control skull buildup in the vessel, particularly in the upper cone
area. Consideration must be given to the potential for excessive refractory wear and damage to the
vessel lip structure and brick retaining top plates.
8.5 Oxygen Lance Technology
8.5.1 Introduction
In modern steelmaking production, a water-cooled lance is used as the refining tool by injecting a
high velocity stream of oxygen onto a molten bath. The velocity or momentum of the oxygen jet
results in the penetration of the slag and metal to promote oxidation reactions over a relatively
small area. The jet velocity and penetration characteristics are functions of the nozzle design. This
section will discuss the design and operation of water-cooled oxygen lances as they apply to mod-
ern steelmaking practices in the BOF.
8.5.2 Oxidation Reactions
The primary reason for blowing oxygen into steel is to remove carbon to endpoint specifications.
The principle reaction which results from the oxygen lancing is the removal of carbon from the
bath as CO. This is an exothermic reaction which adds heat to the system. A small amount of CO2
is also produced, but 90% or more is usually CO. As will be discussed later, the burning of this CO
inside the furnace by reacting with oxygen is called post-combustion.
Other elements such as Si, Mn, and P are also oxidized and are absorbed in the slag layer. These
reactions are also exothermic, further contributing to the required heat to melt scrap and raise the
steel bath to the necessary temperature. The oxidation of the silicon is particularly important
because it occurs early in the oxygen blow and the resultant silica combines with the added lime
to form the molten slag. Table 8.1 presents the oxidation reactions during the steelmaking process.

The oxidation reactions occur in the jet impact zone, called a dimple, which is created by the
impingement of the oxygen. The depression in the liquid bath is a function of the oxygen jet
momentum or the thrust, which is calculated by the following equation:
(8.5.1)
where,
F = force
W = mass flow rate
Ve = exit velocity
g = the acceleration of gravity
The jet thrust and impact angle are optimized to achieve the desired chemical reactions and bath
agitation through the design of the nozzle, Fig. 8.39.
8.5.3 Supersonic Jet Theory
Nozzles are designed for a certain oxygen flow rate, usually measured in scfm (Nm3/min), result-
ing in a certain exit velocity (Mach number), with the required jet profile and force to penetrate
the slag layer and react with the steel bath in the dimple area.
Supersonic jets are produced with convergent/divergent nozzles, Fig. 8.40. A reservoir of stagnant
oxygen is maintained at pressure, Po. The oxygen accelerates in the converging section up to sonic
velocity, Mach = 1, in the cylindrical throat zone. The oxygen then expands in the diverging sec-
tion. The expansion decreases the temperature, density, and pressure of the oxygen and the veloc-
ity increases to supersonic levels, Mach > 1.
As the oxygen jet exits into the furnace, at a pressure Pe, it spreads and decays. A supersonic core
remains for a certain distance from the nozzle. Supersonic jets spread at an angle of approximately
12°.
Proper nozzle design and operation are necessary both to efficiently produce the desired steel-
making reactions and to maximize lance life. If a nozzle is overblown, which means that the oxy-
gen jet is not fully expanded at the time it exits the nozzle, shock waves will develop as the jet

expands outside of the nozzle. Useful energy is lost in these shock waves, and an overblown jet will
impact the steel bath with less force than an ideally expanded jet.
Nozzles are underblown when the jet expands to a pressure equal to the surrounding pressure and
then stops expanding before it exists the nozzle. In this case, the oxygen flow separates from the
internal nozzle surface. Hot gases from the steel vessel then burn back or erode the nozzle exit
area. This erosion not only decreases the lance life, but also results in a loss of jet force, leading to
a soft blowing condition. Overblowing and underblowing conditions are demonstrated in Fig. 8.41.
Fig. 8.42 displays the major components of the BOF oxygen lance. These include oxygen inlet fit-
tings, the oxygen outlet (lance tip), which is made of a high thermal conductivity cast copper
design with precisely machined nozzles to achieve the desired flow rate and jet parameters.
Cooling water is essential in these lances to keep them from burning up in the vessel. The lance

barrel is a series of concentric pipes, an outer pipe,
an intermediate pipe and the central pipe for the
oxygen. Lances must be designed to compensate
for thermal expansion and contraction. The outer
barrel/pipe of the lance is exposed to the high tem-
peratures in the furnace. As its temperature
increase it expands and the overall lance construc-
tion internally is constructed with O-ring seals and
various joints, but can accommodate the thermal
expansion and contraction while in service. The
lance also has a stress-free design and it must be
built with mill duty construction quality to be able
to withstand the normal steel mill operating condi-
tions. Fig. 8.43 presents various types of BOF lance
tips.
Fig. 8.44 is a schematic cutaway of a lance tip dis-
playing the oxygen nozzle and the water channels.
This figure shows a typical 5-hole BOF lance tip.
Its important components are the water cooling
channels where the cooling water flows through the
center of the tip and exits through the outer pipe of
the lance. It is designed to get maximum velocity
of cooling water in the tip area, which is exposed to
the highest temperatures.
8.5.4
Factors Affecting BOF Lance
Performance
There are a number of factors affecting the perfor-
mance and the efficiency of the lance. The perfor-
mance of the lance depends on the conditions in the furnace. The hot metal silicon content is very
important—this effects the amount of slag that forms, the amount of slag that has to be penetrated
by the jet, and also controls the amount of steel slopping in the furnace. The lance operating height
is also very important and must be included in the nozzle design calculations. If the lance is too

low in the furnace it is exposed to extremely high temperatures and the heat transfer from the cool-
ing water may not be sufficient to keep the face of the lance from melting or being burned away
prematurely. If the lance is too high, the thrust of the jet becomes less efficient and the refining
time will take longer, and more oxygen will be required to achieve the necessary decarburization
and steel temperature. The oxygen flow rate is a design parameter that is sometimes limited by the
oxygen supply system, and/or emissions concerns. The exit velocity of the Mach number is also a
factor that is used in the design of the lances. Generally the higher the Mach number the more
forceful the jet is.
Also, important considerations are the number of nozzles and the nozzle hole angle. When BOFs
were originally developed, the first ones were operated with a single nozzle blowing directly down
unto the bath. This caused a lot of slopping and molten material was ejected straight up the mouth
of the vessel. Three hole nozzles slightly angled were developed to minimize slopping, resulting in
a high process yield. Currently many BOFs are operating with 4, 5, or 6-nozzle configurations. Fig.
8.45 shows the effect of increasing the number of nozzles and nozzle exit angle on the impact area
in the bath. As the nozzle angle is increased more of the lateral force component, rather than a ver-
tical force component develops, contributing to more stirring and agitation in the bath. However,
if the lateral component of the jet becomes excessive, higher refractory wear will occur.
8.5.5 Factors Affecting BOF Lance Life
Lance life varies from shop to shop, depending on the various operating practices. A typical lance
life may be 200 heats, although there are some shops which can achieve up to 400 heats per lance
and others may not be able to achieve 150 heats. Cooling water is critical to maintain high lance
life. The flow rate must be maintained at the design rate. The cooling water outlet temperature
should not exceed 140° to 150°F. Water quality is also important. If the water is contaminated with
oxides or dirt, deposits will form inside the lance pipes and tip, resulting in a negative effect on
heat transfer and ultimately reducing lance life. Operating height is critical for achieving the proper
jet penetration of the bath. However if the lance is too low, the tip face may erode or melt.

Underblowing causes nozzle exit erosion and lance tip failure. Excessive skull buildup on the lance
tip must be mechanically removed or burned off—both of these practices could cause damage to
the lance.
8.5.6 New Developments in BOF Lances
The first recent development was the post-combustion lance. Because 90% of the gas evolving
from the oxidation reactions of the bath is carbon monoxide, it is desirable to further combust this
carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide. This reaction is highly exothermic, resulting in addi-
tional heat for the steelmaking process. This is a practice that is being done in several BOF shops
in North America. This practice requires a dual-flow oxygen lance, which has two oxygen outlets.
The main supply of oxygen is distributed through the lance tip similarly to a conventional lance,
Fig. 8.46. The auxiliary oxygen is controlled separately and is blown at a higher elevation in the
vessel. The function of the auxiliary oxygen is to react with the carbon monoxide coming off the
bath, thus creating additional thermal energy which could be used to melt additional scrap, and
help to control skull buildup in the mouth of the vessel.
The second recent development for oxygen lances is its use to splash a protective coating of slag
containing high levels of MgO onto the walls of the BOF, Fig. 8.47. This is done after the steel has
been tapped out of the furnace with some residual slag remaining. The oxygen supply is switched

off and the nitrogen supply is switched on. The lance is lowered to 2–4 feet above the vessel bot-
tom. The nitrogen is then turned on, splashing the molten slag onto the walls of the vessel and cre-
ating a protective slag coating over the refractories. This slag coating has successfully increased the
typical refractory life from 3000 heats to over 20,000 heats per campaign. Furthermore the gun-
ning requirements have also been decreased to less than one pound per ton of steel produced.
8.6 Sub-Lance Equipment
The purpose of a sub-lance is to measure carbon content, bath temperature, soluble oxygen, and
bath level, and to secure a steel sample in an oxygen steelmaking vessel while in the upright posi-
tion. Such sub-lance systems employ mechanical and electrical devices to perform measuring and

a schematic of the process control outputs generated from sub-lance measurements.
During the heat cycle, after a predetermined amount of oxygen has been blown, the oxygen blow
rate is reduced and an in-blow test is made by lowering the sub-lance at a controlled speed through
the hood opening. The sub-lance is stopped at the test elevation 20 in. below the bath surface. This
test elevation is fixed and is regulated from heat to heat by the process computer to compensate for
lining wear throughout the campaign. All pertinent data gathered is transmitted to process com-
puters for adjustments to the oxygen blow cycle and coolant additions to finish the heat at the tap
carbon and temperature aims. After the blow cycle is completed, the sub-lance is lowered to the test
elevation to measure the finished tap carbon and temperature and to retrieve a metal sample for

and end-blow sub-lance measurements.
The sub-lance is raised and lowered within a guide frame by means of a hoist drive incorporating
a drum, wire rope and a series of sheaves. An encoder mounted on the hoist drive indicates posi-
tion of the sub-lance and provides data for a programmable limit switch to control sub-lance travel
and positioning. A cylinder-actuated slidegate is located on the BOF hood to provide a porthole for
sub-lance access to the vessel. The slidegate is continuously cooled by a nitrogen purge arrange-
ment. Cooling water for the sub-lance is continuously supplied from the return system on the oxy-
gen lance. Should the system pressure be insufficient, booster pumps may be utilized.
Consumables for measurement of carbon content, bath temperature, and soluble oxygen, and for
securing a steel sample are pre-loaded into a cassette and are conveyed mechanically to the probe
tip. Prior to connection of the probe to the sub-lance, and also during the measurement cycle, nitro-
gen purging is performed to provide good electrical contact between the probe and the probe
holder. Following capture of the metal sample from the bath, a probe retrieval system is used to

9.1 Introduction
9.1.1 Process Description and Events
The oxygen steelmaking process rapidly
refines a charge of molten pig iron and ambi-
ent scrap into steel of a desired carbon and
temperature using high purity oxygen. Steel
is made in discrete batches called heats. The
furnace or converter is a barrel shaped, open
topped, refractory lined vessel that can rotate
on a horizontal trunnion axis. The basic oper-
ational steps of the process (BOF) are shown
schematically in Fig. 9.1.
The overall purpose of this process is to
reduce the carbon from about 4% to less than
1% (usually less than 0.1%),  to reduce or
control the sulfur and phosphorus, and
finally, to raise the temperature of the liquid
steel made from scrap and liquid hot metal to
approximately 1635°C (2975°F). A typical
configuration is to produce a 250 ton (220
metric ton) heat about every 45 minutes, the
range is approximately 30 to 65 minutes. The
major event times for the process are summa-
rized below in Table 9.1.
These event times, temperatures, and chem-
istries vary considerably by both chance and
intent. The required quantities of hot metal,
scrap, oxygen, and fluxes vary according to
their chemical compositions and tempera-
tures, and to the desired chemistry and tem-
perature of the steel to be tapped. Fluxes are
minerals added early in the oxygen blow, to

control sulfur and phosphorous and to control erosion of the furnace refractory lining. Input
process variations such as analytical (hot metal, scrap, flux and alloy) and measurement (weighing
and temperature) errors contribute to the chemical, thermal and time variations of the process.
The energy required to raise the fluxes, scrap and hot metal to steelmaking temperatures is pro-
vided by oxidation of various elements in the charge materials. The principal elements are iron, sil-
icon, carbon, manganese and phosphorous. The liquid pig iron or hot metal provides almost all of
the silicon, carbon, manganese and phosphorous, with lesser amounts coming from the scrap. Both
the high temperatures of the liquid pig iron and the intense stirring provided when the oxygen jet
is introduced, contribute to the fast oxidation (burning or combustion) of these elements and a
resultant rapid, large energy release. Silicon, manganese, iron and phosphorous form oxides which
in combination with the fluxes, create a liquid slag. The vigorous stirring fosters a speedy reaction
and enables the transfer of energy to the slag and steel bath. Carbon, when oxidized, leaves the
process in gaseous form, principally as carbon monoxide. During the blow, the slag, reaction gases
and steel (as tiny droplets) make up a foamy emulsion. The large surface area of the steel droplets,
in contact with the slag, at high temperatures and vigorous stirring, allow quick reactions and rapid
mass transfer of elements from metal and gas phases to the slag. When the blow is finished the slag
floats on top of the steel bath.
Controlling sulfur is an important goal of the steelmaking process. This is accomplished by first
removing most of it from the liquid hot metal before charging and later, inside the furnace, by con-
trolling the chemical composition of the slag with flux additions.
9.1.2 Types of Oxygen Steelmaking Processes
There are basically three variations of introducing oxygen gas into the liquid bath. These are shown
schematically in Fig. 9.2. Each of these configurations has certain pros and cons. The most com-
mon configuration is the top-blown converter (BOF), where all of the oxygen is introduced via a
water-cooled lance. The blowing end of this lance features three to five special nozzles that deliver
the gas jets at supersonic velocities. In top blowing, the stirring created by these focused, super-
sonic jets cause the necessary slag emulsion to form and keeps vigorous bath flows to sustain the
rapid reactions. The lance is suspended above the furnace and lowered into it. Oxygen is turned on
as the lance moves into the furnace. Slag forming fluxes are added from above the furnace via a
chute in the waste gas hood. A process description is in Section 9.4 of this chapter.
In the bottom-blown converters (OBM or Q-BOP), oxygen is introduced via several tuyeres
installed in the bottom of the vessel, Fig. 9.2. Each tuyere consists of two concentric pipes with the
oxygen passing through the center pipe and a coolant hydrocarbon passing through the annulus
between the pipes. The coolant is usually methane (natural gas) or propane although some shops

have used fuel oil. The coolant chemically
decomposes when introduced at high tem-
peratures and absorbs heat in the vicinity,
thus protecting the tuyere from overheat-
ing. In bottom blowing, all of the oxygen
is introduced through the bottom, and
passes through the bath and slag thus cre-
ating vigorous bath stirring and formation
of a slag emulsion. Powdered fluxes are
introduced into the bath  through the tuy-
eres located in the bottom of the furnace.
The first part of Section 9.5 is a process
description of the OBM (Q-BOP).
The combination blowing or top and
bottom blowing, or mixed blowing
process (Fig. 9.2 shows these variants) is
characterized by both a top blowing lance
and a method of achieving stirring from
the bottom. The configurational differ-
ences in mixed blowing lie principally in
the bottom tuyeres or elements. These
range from fully cooled tuyeres, to
uncooled tuyeres, to permeable elements.
Section 9.5 summarizes further details
about combination blowing processes.
9.1.3 Environmental Issues
The oxygen steelmaking process is characterized by several pollution sources and most require
emission control equipment. These sources are: hot metal transfer, hot metal desulfurization and
skimming of slag, charging of hot metal, melting and refining (blowing), BOF tapping, handling
of dumped BOF slag, handling of fluxes and alloys, and maintenance (burning of skulls, ladle
dumping. etc). Thus, compliance to emission standards is an important design and operating cost
factor for the operation.
9.1.4 How to Use This Chapter
The process falls into several basic component parts which determine important control and eco-
nomic parameters. Accordingly, this chapter is organized into the process component headings of
Sequence of Operations, Raw Materials, Process Reactions and Energy Balance, Variations of the
Process, Process Control Strategies, and Environmental Issues.
The use of this chapter depends on your level of knowledge and interest in the details. It is geared
to bring together several more detailed chapters, such as furnace design, refractory practices, oxy-
gen lance design and physiochemical principles, and to describe how these underlying factors con-
tribute to the oxygen steelmaking process. If you are a steelmaking novice, reading this chapter
first is a good way to get a brief, yet coherent description of the process. Once you have the big
picture, then it is easier to focus on the chapters on detailed design and first principles. If you are
more experienced and want to review or deal with a specific issue, you may turn directly to one of
the component sections or to one of the underlying principle chapters.
A note on References: The material for this chapter is an assimilation of many different sources.
For continuity, rather than specifically cite every source, the references are listed at the end of the
chapter both as a source acknowledgment and as a supplemental reading list. This list is organized
in the same chapter section format. The references are numbered for citing figures and tables.

9.2 Sequence of Operations—Top Blown
9.2.1 Plant Layout
To understand the sequence of the oxygen steelmaking process, one must examine the design, lay-
out and materials flow of the facilities. Figs. 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 show a 275-ton BOF that illustrates
the process. Shops vary considerably in basic layout. Reasons for these layout differences are: type
of product (ingots, cast product or both), the parent company’s operating and engineering culture,
the relationship of the infrastructure and material flows to the rest of the plant, and age of the facil-
ity. (Is the plant an updated older facility or a new greenfield site?) Flow of materials plays a key
role in the design of the shop. Handling of raw materials (scrap, hot metal, fluxes, alloys, refracto-
ries), oxygen lances in-and-out, slag handling, gas cleaning, and transport of steel product must be
accomplished smoothly with minimum delays and interference.
Fig. 9.3 is a plan view of a two-furnace shop and Fig. 9.4 is an elevation of the same plant but look-
ing to the west. Figure 9.5 is an elevation looking to the north. BOFs, OBMs (Q-BOPs) and other
variants can have similar layouts except for oxygen conveying and flux handling details. All shops
feature transportation systems for hot metal and scrap.
9.2.2 Sequence of Operations
9.2.2.1 Scrap Handling
Scrap for a heat is ordered and prepared well in advance of actually charging the furnace. It is
selected according to size and quality and then is brought into the plant via railroad cars, usually
gondolas. It is loaded and mixed into an open ended scrap box which sits on a transfer car. Loading
the box is usually done by magnet or grapple crane in a remote area from the shop. The box/car is
frequently weighed during loading. Some shops use a crane scale to weigh and accumulate each
magnet load. Weights are entered into the shop computer when the loading is completed. The trans-
fer of scrap from rail cars to charging box is done in an attached bay to the BOF shop which is large
enough to handle eight to 24 hours of scrap supply. The scrap box is then conveyed by rail to the
charging aisle. A few shops use rubber tired platform carriers rather than rail cars to move the scrap
box into the shop.
9.2.2.2 Hot Metal Pouring
The hot metal system consists of a track(s) and one to three pouring stations. The liquid pig iron
arrives from the blast furnace in a train of torpedo shaped, refractory lined railroad cars called sub-
marines (subs) or torpedoes. Each car is positioned over a track scale and weighed prior to pour-
ing. There is a trunnion at each end of the car which allows the operator to rotate the open top
toward a transfer ladle located in an adjacent pit. Generally, it takes one or two subs to fill the hot
metal transfer ladle. The control room or operator’s pulpit is equipped with controls for rotating the
sub, operating the ladle transfer car, reading scales, taking temperatures, desulfurization equip-
ment, and sending samples to a chemistry lab. The pouring operation, which generates consider-
able dust emissions, is accomplished under an enclosed hood equipped with an evacuation system
and a baghouse. The dust generated at pouring, called kish, is mainly fine flaked graphite which
precipitates from the carbon saturated metal as its temperature drops during pouring. The poured
weights and measured temperatures are entered into the shop process control computer.
9.2.2.3 Hot Metal Treatment
The hot metal transfer ladle sits on a transfer car at the outside wall of the charging aisle, usually out
of the crane’s reach. Here many shops treat the hot metal by injecting a mixture of lime and magne-
sium to remove sulfur. This process is called hot metal desulfurization. During hot metal treatment,
sulfur is removed from approximately 0.025 wt% to as low as 0.002 wt% and the time of injection
will range from five to twenty minutes. A gas collecting and filtration system collects the fumes from

the desulfurization process as well as collecting the pouring fumes. After desulfurization, the ladle
is tilted by the crane or in a special cradle just to the point of pouring. In this position, the sulfur
containing slag floating on the iron is scraped off into a collection pot using a hydraulic manipu-
lating arm. This slag removal process is called skimming. Often, much metal is scraped out of the
ladle along with the sulfur containing slag. Thus there is an iron yield loss due to deslagging that
ranges from 0.5 to 1.5% depending on equipment design and operator skill. Hot metal temperature
is measured using disposable thermocouples mounted on a mechanical arm called a pantograph.
When the hot metal pouring and treatment are finished, the ladle car moves into the charging aisle
and the ladle becomes available for pickup and charging by the charging crane. Details of hot metal
treatment are found in Chapter 7.
9.2.2.4 Charging the Furnace
The BOF furnaces are open-topped, refractory-lined vessels located in the adjacent aisle called the
furnace aisle. The furnaces rotate on trunnions so they can be tilted both toward the charging and
tapping aisles. The furnace refines the steel in an upright position although it is capable of rotat-
ing 360°. The furnace aisle contains the furnaces, flux conveying system, furnace alloy chute and
oxygen lances in a top-blown shop. Here, the furnace aisle is very high to accommodate loading
and operation of 60–70 foot long oxygen lances. There is a space and capital cost advantage of an
OBM (Q-BOP) that does not require the high elevation for lances.
In nearly all North American shops, scrap is charged first. Many shops lift and tilt the box empty-
ing the scrap into the furnace with the charging crane. Charging scrap before hot metal is consid-
ered a safer practice that avoids splashing. The crane method usually has faster scrap charging
times. However, many shops load the scrap boxes onto special charging machines that can move
on rails in front of the furnace. This scrap charging machine has a hydraulic tilting mechanism that
raises the scrap box to 45° and charges them one at a time. It usually holds two scrap boxes. While
the scrap charging machine is often slower than the crane, it frees up the charging crane for other
duties and more quickly handles two box charges per heat when required.
After scrap is charged, liquid hot metal is charged into the furnace using the charging crane in the
charging aisle. The ladle is tilted and the liquid hot metal is poured into the furnace. This process
takes one to five minutes depending on the design of the furnace hood and shop fugitive emission
systems. Some shops can charge quickly because the fume from pouring into the furnace is
effectively collected by the hood and a closed roof monitor collection system. Other shops with
less advanced fume collection systems, must pour rather slowly to minimize the heat and fume
cloud, thus taking a lengthy three to five minutes to charge hot metal. 
9.2.2.5 Computer Calculations
Prior to pouring hot metal and charging scrap, a computer calculation is initiated by the pulpit oper-
ator to determine the charge recipe. The grade and temperature and chemistry aims are loaded into
the shop computer beforehand when a heat is put on the schedule line-up. The temperature and
chemical content of the hot metal can vary significantly. The hot metal is sampled and analyzed at
the chemistry lab—a process that takes from three to ten minutes—and the results and ID are trans-
mitted to the computer. The temperature of the hot metal is measured in the ladle after it is poured
and that result is transmitted to the computer. The chemistry of the scrap is calculated from the
known mixture of the scrap; its temperature is assumed to be ambient. Thus, all of the characteris-
tics of the charged materials and the heat aims are available for the charge recipe calculation. The
principal aim parameters for the furnace heat are carbon and temperature. Other specific aims are
sulfur, phosphorous and slag composition (%FeO level).  Missing any of these aims can be very
costly later and can require time consuming corrective actions or create significant quality prob-
lems. Often, there are several update calculations as items are weighed and charged to correct for
minor weighing irregularities and mistakes. The results of these calculations are principally the
amounts of coolants, fluxes and oxygen. Most shops’ calculations have features that allow early
calculation of hot metal and scrap weights as well. All shops use the charge recipe calculation.

Some shops have sensors (sub-lance, light meter, bomb-drop thermocouples, etc.) that measure
carbon and/or temperature near the end of the blow. The sensor’s measurements are used to make
late oxygen and coolant corrections to bring the carbon and temperature to aims. This saves time
and money by reducing the frequency of corrective actions. 
9.2.2.6 Oxygen Blow
After scrap and hot metal are charged, the furnace is set upright and the oxygen is supplied through
a water-cooled lance. There are two lance lift carriages above each furnace but only one lance is
used at a time; the other is a spare. The oxygen blow times typically range from 13 to 25 minutes
from one shop to another with an average of about 20 minutes. The oxygen is added in several
batches. Each batch is characterized by a different lance height above the static steel bath and
sometimes by an oxygen rate change. These blowing rates and lance heights vary considerably
from shop to shop and depend on the pressure and quality of the oxygen supply. The oxygen blow
rate ranges from 560 to 1000 Nm3 per minute (20,000 to 35,000 scfm). A practical limit on the rate
is often the volume of the furnace and the capacity of the gas collection and cleaning system to
handle the gaseous reaction product and fume. A typical example of the oxygen batches is sum-
marized in Table 9.2.
The first batch lance height is very high to avoid the possibility of lance tip contact with the scrap
and to safely establish the oxidizing, heat generating reactions. If the lance would contact the pile
of scrap in the furnace, a serious water leak could result causing a dangerous steam explosion.
The second batch lance height is usually approximately 20 to 30 inches lower than the first batch
and approximately 20 to 30 inches higher than the main batch. The purpose here is to increase the
reaction rate and control the early slag formation. This second or middle batch generates some
early iron oxide to increase proper slag formation.
The main batch is where most of the action occurs—it is by far the longest batch. The lance height
is an empirical compromise between achieving faster carbon removal rates and proper slag mak-
ing. Some shops have more than three batches. Some change oxygen conditions (blow rate and
lance height) nearly continuously. Other shops will raise the lance and change the blow rate near
the end of the main batch to control the viscosity and chemical reactivity of the slag by raising its
FeO content.
The position of the lance is very important for proper functioning of the process. If the lance is too
high, the slag will be over stirred and over-oxidized with higher FeO percentages. This will cause
higher than normal yield losses and lower tap alloy efficiencies due to oxidation losses. Further,
the rate of carbon removal is reduced and becomes erratic. Slag volume increases and there is an
increased chance of slopping, which is an uncontrolled slag drooling or spilling over the top of the
furnace. When the lance is too low, carbon removal increases somewhat, slag formation, slag reac-
tivity, and FeO are reduced and sulfur and phosphorus removal problems often occur. If the lance
is very low, then spitting of metal droplets or sparking occurs which cause severe and dangerous
metallic deposits, called skulls, on the lance and the lower waste gas hood. 
Obviously, there is a correct lance height. It varies from shop to shop and depends on furnace con-
figuration, lance configuration and oxygen supply pressure or flow rate. Each shop must find its

own best lance height and comply with it. The problem is how to measure it. It can change quickly
and significantly as a result of changes in furnace refractory shapes. Traditional measurement
methods have been burn-off tests, where a pipe is wedged in an oxygen port. The lance is then low-
ered and the pipe is allowed to melt off at the slag-metal interface. This is done while waiting for
a chemistry just before tap. This test has been erratic due to the temperature and fluidity of the slag,
time of immersion, and initial protection of the pipe. This test has fallen out of favor because it is
dangerous for  the operator to attach the pipe to the lance. 
More modern techniques include mathematically integrating the furnace volume from a refractory
lining laser scan or determining the distance to the bath/slag using a radar unit mounted above the
furnace. Generally, the radar method measures the height of the slag surface after it has collapsed
at the end of a low carbon blow. There is uncertainty about the location of the slag steel interface
but the measurement is considered better than none.
9.2.2.7 Flux Additions
Soon after the oxygen is turned on, flux additions are started and are usually completed at the end
of the second batch of oxygen. The fluxes control the chemistry and sulfur and phosphorus capac-
ity of the slag. The principle active ingredients from the fluxes are CaO (from burnt lime) and MgO
(from dolomitic lime). The CaO component is used principally to control sulfur and phosphorous.  
The dolomitic lime is used to saturate the slag with MgO. The principle ingredient of the furnace
refractories is MgO. Steelmaking slags without it are very corrosive to the lining. The corrosion
rate is reduced dramatically when MgO is added to saturate the slag. It is much cheaper to satisfy
the slag’s appetite for MgO from dolomitic lime than by dissolving it from the lining.
Another flux addition sometimes used in high carbon heats is fluorspar (CaF2, or spar). This min-
eral is charged to dissolve the lime and to reduce the viscosity of the slag. It is used for making
high carbon heats, (>0.30%C at the end of blow) because the iron oxide concentrations are low on
these heats. Iron oxides help dissolve lime in lower carbon heats but these oxides are present in low
concentrations in high carbon heats. To compensate for less FeO, many shops use spar to dissolve
the lime. However, spar is used very sparingly because it is very corrosive on refractory linings.
Unfortunately there is no corrosion inhibiting practice or ingredient to stop the corrosive effects of
spar. In addition, spar forms hydroflouric acids in the gas cleaning system that seriously corrode
any metal surfaces in the hood and cleaning systems. Finally, significant fluoride emissions are
serious pollution and health hazards.
Coolants are other additions often made at about the same time as fluxes. There are several types
of coolants. Iron ore, either lump or pellets, are the most common type. Varieties of limestone (cal-
cium and/or magnesium carbonates) are often used but the cooling effects are less dependable than
ores. Some shops use pre-reduced pellets which contain about 93% iron and thus behave similar to
scrap. The coolant amounts are calculated by the computer. Ore (iron oxide) should be added as
soon as possible to achieve early lime dissolution and to reduce the possibility of vigorous reac-
tions and slopping at mid blow. 
9.2.2.8 Final Oxygen Adjustments and Dynamic Sensors
The third or main batch is usually blown at 80 in. to 95 in. lance height above the bath depending
on furnace design, practice and available oxygen pressure.
In many shops, the oxygen lance height is changed near the end of the blow to control the iron
oxide (FeO) in the slag. Some shops activate their dynamic control systems to measure carbon and
temperatures at this point. Oxygen is turned off based on either the static charge calculation or
based on a modified result calculated from the dynamic sensor(s).

9.2.2.9 Turndown and Testing
After the blow is finished, the furnace is then rotated towards the charging side. Often the slag is
very foamy and fills up the upper volume of the furnace. This foam will often take several minutes
to collapse and settle down on its own. Thus, the operators will often toss pieces of wood or card-
board or scrapped rubber tires onto the bath to increase the collapse of the foam.  
There is a heat shield on the charging floor on a track that is positioned in front of the furnace dur-
ing the blow. The mouth of the furnace is rotated toward the charging side nearly 90° so the oper-
ator can look inside the furnace and sample the heat for chemical analysis and temperature
measurement. Here, he also assesses the furnace condition to determine when and if any special
maintenance is required.
9.2.2.10 Corrective Actions
Based on the chemical laboratory results, the melter decides if the heat is ready for tap or requires
corrective action—a reblow and/or coolant. If a corrective action is required, the furnace is set
upright. A reblow of additional oxygen may be required, with or without coolants or fluxes, to
arrive at the desired (aim) chemistry and temperature. Usually, after a corrective action, another
furnace turndown is required, adding five to eight minutes to the heat time. When the heat is ready,
the furnace is rotated upward and over toward the tap side.
9.2.2.11 Quick Tap Procedures
Japan and some European shops reduce sampling and testing times to one to three minutes by using
a quick tap procedure. Most of these shops use sub-lances to measure temperature and carbon by
the liquidus thermal arrest technique. This testing is done without moving the furnace from the
upright position. Success of quick-tap depends on consistently meeting the sulfur and phosphorus
specification. This procedure can save three to six minutes of lab analysis time. These shops sim-
ply proceed immediately to tapping the furnace. Consequently, such shops often turn out 60 heats
per day from two active furnaces.
Some North American shops have adopted a simplified variation of the quick-tap practice. A few
have sub-lances. Others use the bomb drop-in thermocouples with or without oxygen sensors.
Here a heavy cast iron bomb assembly with a specially wound and protected lead wire is dropped
into the furnace. The wire lasts long enough to get a reading. The readings are more accurate if the
oxygen is stopped but some shops get a usable reading during the blow. Again, tramp elements, S,
P and other residuals are assumed to be acceptable and tapping proceeds immediately. Some two
furnace shops use this technique to minimize production losses when one of the furnaces is being
relined or repaired.
9.2.2.12 Tapping
For tapping, the furnace is rotated to the tap side and the steel flows through a taphole into a ladle
sitting on a car below. The slag floats on top of the steel bath inside the furnace. Near the end of
tapping (four to ten minutes) a vortex may develop near the draining taphole and entrain some of
the slag into the ladle. There are various devices used to minimize or detect the onset of slag. Heavy
uncontrolled slag entrainment into the ladle has a significant adverse effect on production costs and
steel quality.
During tapping, alloys are added to adjust the composition to the final levels or to concentrations
suitable for further ladle treatment processes. Typically, 2000 to 6000 lbs of alloys are added at tap.
After tap, the ladle may be transported for further processing to a ladle arc furnace and/or a
degasser. Some shops and some grades permit transport to ingot teeming or to the caster without
any further treatments.

An increasing number of grades require limiting the amount of slag carryover to the ladle and close
control of slag viscosity and chemical composition. Various devices have been developed to mini-
mize slag draining from the furnace. There are two main techniques. One method consists of slow-
ing down the pouring stream at the end of tap with a refractory plug. Usually a ball-shaped device,
called a ball, or a cone shaped device, called a dart, is dropped into the taphole using a carefully
positioned boom near the end of tap. These devices have a controlled density, between steel and
slag, causing them to float at the slag-steel interface. Thus, it plugs the tap at about the time steel
is drained out. These units can be very erratic depending on the geometry of the furnace, device
shape and slag characteristics. But many shops have successfully minimized slag carryover into the
ladle. Another approach is to detect slag carryover with a sensor coil installed around the taphole
refractory. With suitable instrumentation, this system gives the operator an accurate and early
warning of slag draining through the taphole at which time tapping is stopped by raising the fur-
nace. The net result of these slag control/detection practices is to reduce furnace slag in the steel
ladle, thereby improving chemical consistency and reducing the extent of post-tapping treatments
and additions.
The condition and maintenance of the taphole and the furnace wall around it can influence alloy
recovery consistency and metallic yield. Poor taphole maintenance and practice can lead to a burn-
through in either the furnace shell or the taphole support frame. A very small taphole can signifi-
cantly increase the tap time, reducing productivity, steel temperature, and nitrogen pickup in the
ladle. A very large taphole will not allow enough time to add and mix the alloy additions in the
ladle. Further, aged tapholes have ragged streams with higher surface areas that will entrain air,
which in turn dissolves more oxygen and makes control of oxygen levels in the steel difficult.
A newly installed taphole yields a tap time of seven or eight minutes. Tapholes are generally
replaced when the tap time falls below four minutes. A very important aspect of the melter/opera-
tor’s job is to carefully monitor the condition and performance of the tap hole.
Steel is often lost to the slag pot, a yield loss, when a pocket or depression develops near or around
the tap opening. Such a depression can prevent several tons of steel from being drained into the
ladle. Again, the operator must carefully monitor yields and furnace condition and make repairs to
prevent this problem. 
9.2.2.13 Slagging Off and Furnace Maintenance
After tapping, the furnace is rotated back upright to prepare for furnace maintenance. The remain-
ing slag is either immediately dumped into a slag pot toward the charging side or it is splashed on
the walls of the furnace to coat the lining and thereby extend its life. This slag splashing (coating)
maintenance is done by blowing nitrogen through the oxygen lance for two to three minutes, see
Section 4.2. Often, the furnace is simply rocked back-and-forth to coat or build up the bottom,
charge and tap pad areas. Dolomitic stone or dolomitic lime additions are made to stiffen the slag
for splashing or to freeze the slag to the bottom. Frequently, repairs by spraying a cement-like
refractory slurry are made as required prior to the next charge.  
The furnace is then ready for the next heat.
9.2.3 Shop Manning
9.2.3.1 Introduction
Another way of looking at the steelmaking process is to look at how the operators and workers run
the process. The shop crew is very much a coordinated team. Virtually all oxygen steelmaking shops
operate around the clock—21 shifts per week. Some are able to schedule a down or repair turn once
per week or every other week in conjunction with a similar scheduled blast furnace outage.
Similarly, the down stream caster facility will also schedule a repair outage.

When manning is summarized, the manning levels are expressed on a per turn basis. To get the totals
for 21 turns per week (three turns per day times seven days per week) multiply the turn manning by
four and add the management, staff and maintenance forces (who work only five day turns).
The example here will cover a two furnace shop producing about 40 to 45 heats per day. Three fur-
nace shop issues and exceptions will be noted in the discussion. The actual figures in a given shop
may vary from the example presented here as different shops have different numbers of furnaces
(two or three) and different demands (steel grades and production levels).
9.2.3.2 Hot Metal
Transporting the hot metal subs to the BOF requires one man if the engine has radio control. The
pouring station has an operator who weighs and pours and an assistant who plugs in electric power
to tilt the subs and moves the train locally and changes the subs at the pouring station. If there is
desulfurizing, there will be one or two other operators to desulfurize, skim and maintain the
equipment. A three furnace shop will double this crew to operate two or three pouring and treat-
ment stations.
9.2.3.3 Charging Crane
A charging crane operator is required, often with a relief operator. Busy shops may operate two
charging cranes with a relief operator serving the charge and scrap cranes. Often one relief crane
operator serves both the charging and teeming or the casting crane.
9.2.3.4 Scrap
Scrap is often premixed by a contractor or a plant crew at a separate facility nearby. Gondolas bear-
ing scrap are transported into the BOF by the plant railroad. There will be one or two scrap crane
operators (depending on how many heats the shop makes) loading and weighing the boxes.  The
charging crane then picks up the scrap boxes and charges them into the furnace or puts them on a
charging machine.
9.2.3.5 Furnace and Charging Floor
The overall responsibility for production of the shop during the turn belongs to the turn supervi-
sor. There is a furnace crew consisting of a melter (who is the crew leader and is responsible for
making the heat), pulpit operator who operates the computer, lance and flux systems, and two or
three furnace operators. In small, lean shops, the melter is also the turn supervisor. The furnace
operators actually position the furnace for charging, (operate a scrap charging machine if there is
one) and test the heat by sampling the heats for chemistry and temperature. They also weigh up
alloys, tap the heat and maintain the furnace refractory—all under the melter’s supervision. In
larger, high productivity shops, there may be one of these crews and a melter for each active fur-
nace. In this case, the turn supervisor coordinates all shop activities.
9.2.3.6 Flux Handling
There is a track-hopper operator who controls equipment that unloads the fluxes and alloys from
rail cars and trucks. Often there is an assistant at the unloading station at ground level, with the
operator  on the top floor where the conveyer dumper is located. Generally, this operation occurs
on day turn in smaller shops or day and afternoon turns in larger shops.
9.2.3.7 Maintenance
There is an on-turn maintenance crew which responds to delay and breakdown calls and performs
certain preventative maintenance procedures that are safe during furnace operation. Usually, the
day time crew is larger to handle calls and do preventative maintenance. The maintenance crew also

load and unload oxygen lances and maintain the oxygen system. Turn maintenance people consist
of mechanical millwrights and electricians (three to ten millwrights and electricians). The day turn
crew also includes instrument calibration, instrument repair and electronic skillspersons.
9.2.3.8 General Labor
Often, there is a small day turn labor crew (one to three persons) which operates a forklift trucks
to transport various alloy additions for tapping and assists getting spray materials ready for furnace
maintenance. The operators also run a mechanical sweeper and hand sweep around the shop to
maintain good housekeeping.
9.2.3.9 Chemistry Lab
In older shops there is a vacuum conveyer systems where samples are transported to the chemistry
lab. Laboratory manning will vary widely depending on how centralized the lab is to the whole
plant. An increasing number of shops are installing robot labs for faster and more convenient ser-
vice of chemical analysis. However, the robot lab requires an operator whose responsibility is
supervising calibration, changing grinding media, and lubrication and maintenance of mechanical
and optical equipment. The advantages of a well maintained robot lab are speed and consistency in
sample preparation and analysis rather than labor savings.
9.2.3.10 Refractory Maintenance
Often furnace maintenance is done by the floor furnace crew. However, larger and busier shops will
have an outside contractor or a separate crew to spray repair the furnaces. This crew may operate
only during day turns and  consists of two or three persons.
9.2.3.11 Relines and Major Repairs
Maintenance may schedule a crew to make hood and furnace shell repairs while relining is going
on. Often, special code welding skills (usually hood or thick shell repairs) are required and are
often done by an outside contractor. With the growth of slag splashing, which causes infrequent
relines, hood repair work must be scheduled several times between relines.
9.2.3.12 Ladle Liners
Hot metal and steel ladles are a very important component of steelmaking. Hot metal ladle life is
typically 1500 pours and a typical small shop will carry a fleet of four or five ladles of which two
or three are active. Steel ladles last from 60 to 150 heats. Steel ladle fleets may vary from eight to
25 depending on the size of the shop. Relining of ladles is usually supervised by the Teeming
Supervisor. Ladle lining crew sizes vary widely.
9.2.3.13 Management and Clerical
Finally, management and clerical staffs vary widely from shop to shop. The General Supervisor
(sometimes called Area Manager) supervises the day-to-day operation and plans the course of the
facility. Often there are separate area supervisors (five day turns per week only) covering hot metal
pouring and treatment, furnace floor operations, scrap and flux loading, and maintenance. Usually
there is a small clerical staff (one to five), a practice engineer, and a small, assigned crew of met-
allurgical or quality assurance (QA) people. 
In summary, even in a small shop, the steelmaking team brings together many different skills work-
ing in concert. In addition to the production crew, there are numerous support groups, principally
maintenance, that keep the shop running smoothly. Table 9.3 summarizes the manning of a small
BOF shop.

9.3 Raw Materials
9.3.1 Introduction
The basic raw materials required to make steel in the oxygen steelmaking process include: hot
metal from the blast furnace, steel scrap and/or any other metallic iron source(such as DRI), ore
(Fe2O3), and fluxes such as burnt lime (CaO), dolomitic lime (CaO–MgO), dolomitic stone
(MgCO3–CaCO3) and fluorspar (CaF2).
Scrap, charged from a scrap box, is the first material to be charged into the furnace. The hot metal
is then poured into the vessel from a ladle, after which the oxygen blow is started. The fluxes, usu-
ally in lump form, are charged into the furnace through a bin system after the start of the oxygen
blow. The fluxes can also be injected into the furnace in powder form through bottom tuyeres.
The composition and amounts of raw materials used in the steelmaking process vary from one shop
to another, depending on their availability and the economics of the process. The basic raw mate-
rials used in the oxygen steelmaking process are described below.
9.3.2 Hot Metal
The hot metal, or liquid pig iron, is the primary source of iron units and energy in the oxygen steel-
making process. Hot metal is usually produced in blast furnaces, where it is cast into submarine shaped
torpedo cars and transported either to a desulfurization station or directly to the steelmaking shop.
9.3.2.1 Composition
The chemical composition of hot metal can vary substantially, but typically it contains about
4.0–4.5% carbon, 0.3–1.5% silicon, 0.25–2.2% manganese, 0.04–0.20% phosphorus and

0.03–0.08% sulfur (before hot metal desulfurization).1 The sulfur level in desulfurized hot metal
can be as low as 0.001%. The composition of the hot metal depends on the practice and charge in
the blast furnace. Generally, there is a decrease in the silicon content and an increase in the sulfur
of the hot metal with colder blast furnace practices. The phosphorus contents of the hot metal
increases if the BOF slag is recycled at the sinter plant.
Carbon and silicon are the chief contributors of energy. The hot metal silicon affects the amount of
scrap charged in the heat. For example, if the hot metal silicon is high, there will be greater
amounts of heat generated due to its oxidation, hence more scrap can be charged in the heat. Hot
metal silicon also affects the slag volume, and therefore the lime consumption and resultant iron
yield.
9.3.2.2 Determination of Carbon and Temperature
The hot metal is saturated with carbon, and its carbon concentration depends on the temperature
and the concentration of other solute elements such as silicon and manganese. The carbon content
of the hot metal increases with increasing temperature and manganese content, and decreases with
increasing silicon content. 
It is important to know the temperature and the carbon content of hot metal at the time it is poured
into the BOF for steelmaking process control. The hot metal temperature is normally measured at
the hot metal desulfurizer or at the time it is poured into the transfer ladle from the torpedo cars.
If the hot metal temperature has not been measured close to the time of its charge into the BOF,
then it can be estimated using the last hot metal temperature measurement, in conjunction with a
knowledge of the rate of the hot metal ladle temperature loss with time, and the time elapsed
between the last temperature measurement and the BOF charge. Typically, the temperature of the
hot metal is in the range of 1315–1370°C (2400–2500°F). Once the temperature is measured or
calculated, the carbon content of the hot metal at the time of charge can be estimated using a regres-
sion equation, which is mainly in terms of the temperature, hot metal silicon and manganese.
Calculating the carbon in this manner has turned out to be as accurate as analyzing it chemically
while saving considerable lab effort.
9.3.2.3 Hot Metal Treatment
Desulfurization is favored at high temperatures and low oxygen potentials. Also, the presence of
other solute elements in the metal such as carbon and silicon increases the activity of sulfur, which
in turn enhances desulfurization. Thus low oxygen potential and high carbon and silicon contents
make conditions more favorable to remove sulfur from hot metal rather than from steel in the BOF.
Not all hot metal is desulfurized. Hot metal used for making steel grades with stringent sulfur spec-
ifications is desulfurized in the hot metal desulfurizer. The hot metal is poured into a transfer ladle
from a torpedo car. It is then transported to the desulfurization station where the desulfurizer can
reduce hot metal sulfur to as low as 0.001%, but more typically to 0.004 or 0.005%.
Typical desulfurizing reagents include lime-magnesium, and calcium carbide. Powdered reagents
are generally injected using nitrogen gas. Apart from reducing sulfur to low levels, a hot metal
desulfurizer can also allow the blast furnace operator to increase productivity by reducing the lime-
stone burden and thereby producing higher sulfur hot metal.
It is important that the slag produced after hot metal desulfurization is removed effectively through
slag skimming. This slag contains high amounts of sulfur, and any slag carried over into the BOF,
where conditions are not good for desulfurization, will cause sulfur pickup in the steel.
9.3.2.4 Weighing
The weighing of the hot metal is done on a scale while it is being poured into the transfer ladle. It
is very important that the weight of the hot metal is accurately known, as any error can cause prob-
lems in turndown chemistry, temperature and heat size in the BOF. This weight is an important
input to the static charge model.

9.3.3 Scrap
Scrap is the second largest source of iron units in the steelmaking operation after hot metal.  Scrap
is basically recycled iron or steel, that is either generated within the mill (e.g. slab crops, pit scrap,
cold iron or home scrap), or purchased from an outside source. 
The scrap is weighed when loaded in the scrap box. The crane operator loads the box based on the
weight and mix requirements of the upcoming heat. Then the box is transported to the BOF. It is
important that the crane operator loads correct amounts and types of scrap (the scrap mix) as indi-
cated by the computer or a fixed schedule. Otherwise the turndown performance of the heat will
be adversely affected. Some typical types of scrap used in a BOF heat, and few of their properties
are listed in Table 9.4.
Normally, the lighter scrap is loaded in the front, and the heavier scrap in the rear end of the box.
This causes the lighter scrap to land first in the furnace as the scrap box is tilted. It is preferable
that the lighter scrap fall on the refractory lining first, before the heavier scrap, to minimize refrac-
tory damage. Also, since heavy scrap is more difficult to melt than light scrap, it is preferable that
it sits on top so that it is closest to the area of oxygen jet impingement and hence melt faster. 
Scrap pieces that are too large to be charged into the furnace are cut into smaller pieces by means
of shears or flame cutting. Thin, small pieces of scrap such as sheet shearings and punchings are
compressed into block like bundles called bales using special hydraulic presses. Normally, larger,
heavier pieces of scrap are more difficult to melt than lighter, smaller ones.
Unmelted scrap can cause significant problems in process control. It may result in high tempera-
tures or missed chemistries at turndown. Bottom or mixed blowing, which can significantly
enhance the mixing characteristics in the furnace, improves scrap melting of larger pieces. 
Stable elements present in scrap, such as copper, molybdenum, tin and nickel cannot be oxidized
and hence cannot be removed from metal. These elements can only be diluted. Detinned bundles,
where tin is removed by shredding and treating with NaOH and then rebaled, are available but at
considerably higher cost. Elements such as aluminum, silicon and zirconium can be fully oxidized
from scrap and become incorporated in the slag. Elements which fall in the middle category in
terms of their tendency to react, such as phosphorus, manganese and chromium distribute them-
selves between the metal and slag. Zinc and lead are mostly removed from scrap the bath as vapor.
Most steelmaking shops typically use about 20 to 35% of their total metallic charge as scrap, with
the exact amount depending on the capacity of the steelmaking process. Much of this capacity
depends on factors like the silicon, carbon and temperature of the hot metal, use of a post com-
bustion lance, and external fuels charged, such as anthracite coal. The scrap ratio is also influenced
by the relative cost of scrap and hot metal.
9.3.4 High Metallic Alternative Feeds
Direct reduced iron (DRI) is used in some steelmaking shops as a coolant as well as a source of
iron units. DRI typically contains about 88–94% total iron (about 85–95% metallization),
0.5–3%C, 1–5% SiO2, 3–8% FeO and small amounts of CaO, MgO and Al2O3.2 DRI may contain
phosphorus in the range of 0.005 to 0.09%, sulfur in the range 0.001 to 0.03% and low concentra-
tions of nitrogen (usually less than 20 ppm).
DRI is normally fed into the BOF in briquetted form size at approximately 1 in. The DRI briquettes
are passivated (by coating or binder) to eliminate any tendency to pyrophoricity (spontaneous burn-
ing) so that they can be handled conveniently in the steelmaking shop. DRI is usually fed into the
steelmaking furnace through the bin system.
Certain elements such as nickel, copper and molybdenum can be added to the heat with the scrap
charge. These elements do not oxidize to any significant level and they dissolve evenly in the metal
during the oxygen blow. These additions can also be made after the oxygen blow, or in the ladle
during tapping.

9.3.5 Oxide Additions
9.3.5.1 Iron Oxide Materials
Iron ore is usually charged into the BOF as a coolant and it is often used as a scrap substitute. Iron
ores are available in the form of lumps or pellets, and their chemical compositions vary from dif-
ferent deposits as shown in Table 9.5.3 Iron ores are useful scrap substitutes as they contain lower
amounts of residual elements such as copper, zinc, nickel, and molybdenum. The cooling effect of
iron ore is about three times higher than scrap. The reduction of the iron oxide in the ore is
endothermic and higher amounts of hot metal and lower amounts of scrap are required when ore is
used for cooling. Iron ores must be charged early in the blow when the carbon content in the bath
is high to effectively reduce the iron oxide. The reduction of the iron oxides in the ore produces
significant amounts of gas, and consequently increases slag foaming and the tendency to slop. Late
ore additions have a detrimental affect on iron yield and end point slag chemistry. If only ore is
used as a coolant just before tap, the slag becomes highly oxidized and fluid, enhancing slag car-
ryover into the ladle. The delay in the cooling reaction from the unreduced ore causes a sudden
decrease in temperature or a violent ladle reaction resulting in over-oxidation of the steel.
9.3.5.2 Waste Oxides
Economic and environmental issues have driven steel producers to recycle the waste iron oxides
generated in the process. The increasing price of scrap, in addition to the increasing costs involved
in the environmentally safe disposal of waste oxides, have encouraged steelmakers to recycle
these materials back into the steelmaking process. Throughout the plant, various waste oxides and
mill scales are collected and used in the sinter plant to produce some of the feed for the blast fur-
nace. However, this does not consume all available oxides. In recent times, methods have been
developed to substitute waste oxides in the BOF in place of ore. Mill scale has been used as a
coolant in the BOF in amounts ranging from 5,000 to 25,000 lb.4 Mill scale was found to be very
effective in increasing the hot metal to scrap ratio; however, it causes heavy slopping during the
process. Mill scale and other iron oxide additions are reduced during the main blow releasing iron
and oxygen. This additional oxygen becomes available for carbon removal thus speeding up the
overall reaction. Slopping is likely caused by the increased slag volume  associated with using
more hot metal (more pounds of Si and C generate more SiO2 and CO, respectively) and by the
increased reaction rate.
Waste oxide briquettes (WOB) containing steelmaking sludges, grit, and mill scale have also been
charged into the furnace as a scrap substitute.5 The waste oxides collected from the BOF fumes
during the blow are high in iron content, typically more than 60 wt.%. These fumes, fines (sludge)
and coarse (grit) waste oxide particles are blended, dried, mixed with lime and binders, and pressed
into pillow-shaped briquettes. The briquettes are then cured for over 48 hours to remove their mois-
ture. A typical composition of WOBs is 35 wt.% sludge, 20 wt.% grit, and 45 wt.% mill scale, see

Additions of WOBs are made early in the oxygen blow when the carbon content in the bath is high
to ensure the reduction of ferrous, ferric, and manganese oxides to metallic iron and manganese.
If the WOBs are added late in the blow, the oxides are likely to stay unreduced, resulting in yield
loss, slopping, and a highly oxidized slag at turndown. WOBs are about two times better coolants
than scrap, because their oxide reduction is endothermic, and therefore a higher hot metal ratio is
required when WOBs are used for cooling—a situation similar to using ore. Various studies show
that using WOBs causes no adverse effects on lining wear, molten iron yield, turndown perfor-
mance and ladle slag FeO in the BOF.
9.3.6 Fluxes
9.3.6.1 Burnt Lime
In basic oxygen steelmaking, burnt lime consumption ranges from 40 to 100 lb. per net ton of steel
produced. The amount consumed depends on the hot metal silicon, the proportion of hot metal to
scrap, the initial (hot metal) and final (steel aim) sulfur and phosphorus contents. Burnt lime is pro-
duced by calcining limestone (CaCO3) in rotary, shaft, or rotary hearth type kilns.1 The calcining
reaction is given below:
CaCO3 + Heat ® CaO + CO2
(9.3.1)
The calcination of high-calcium limestone will produce burnt lime containing about 96 wt.% CaO,
1 wt.% MgO, and 1 wt.% SiO2. The sulfur content in burnt lime ranges from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%. Most
shops require less than 0.04 wt.% S in the lime to produce low sulfur steels.1,6 Since an enormous
amount of burnt lime is charged into the BOF within a short period of time, careful selection of the
lime quality is important to improve its dissolution in the slag. In general, small lump sizes (1/2–1
in.) with high porosity have higher reactivity and promote rapid slag formation. The most common
quality problems with either burnt or dolomitic lime are uncalcined inner cores, excess fines and too
low a reactivity (calcined too hot or too long).
9.3.6.2 Dolomitic Lime
Dolomitic lime is charged with the burnt lime to saturate the slag with MgO, and reduce the disso-
lution of dolomite furnace refractories into the slag. Typically dolomitic lime contains about 36–42
wt.% MgO and 55–59 wt.% CaO.1 Similarly, the dolomitic stone contains about 40% MgCO3. The
dolomitic lime charge into the BOF ranges from 30 to 80 lb. per net ton of steel produced, which
represents about 25 to 50% of the total flux charge into the furnace (burnt plus dolomitic lime). The
large variation in these additions strongly depends on experience and adjustments made by the
steelmakers. These are based on observations of chemical attack of the slag on furnace refractories.
Most of the dolomitic lime produced in the United States is obtained by calcining dolomitic stone
in rotary kilns. The calcining reaction of the dolomitic stone is  similar to that of limestone:
MgCO3 + Heat ® MgO + CO2
(9.3.2)
In some BOF operations dolomitic stone is added directly into the furnace as a coolant, and as a
source of MgO to saturate the slag. It can also be added to stiffen the slag prior to slag splashing.
It is important for the steelmaker to control the chemistry and size of the dolomitic lime.

9.3.6.3 Limestone
In most BOF shops limestone (CaCO3) or dolomitic stone, (CaCO3•MgCO3) is frequently used as
a coolant rather than as a flux. Limestone is commonly used to cool the bath if the turndown tem-
perature is higher than the specified aim. When limestone is heated, the endothermic calcining
reaction occurs producing CaO and CO2, causing a temperature drop in the furnace.  The extent of
the temperature drop just before tap depends on the furnace size and slag conditions and is known
for each shop. For example, in a 300 ton heat, 1000 lb. of limestone will drop the temperature of
the bath by about 6°C (10°F).
9.3.6.4 Fluorspar
Calcium fluoride or fluorspar (CaF2) is a slag fluidizer that reduces the viscosity of the slag.  When
added to the BOF it promotes rapid lime (CaO) dissolution in the slag by dissolving the dicalcium
silicate (2CaO•SiO2) layer formed around the lime particles which retards the dissolution of the
lime in the slag. In recent times, fluorspar has been used very sparingly because of its very corro-
sive attack of all types of refractories, including both furnace and ladle. Also, the fluorides form
strong acids in the waste gas collection system which corrode structural parts and are undesirable
emissions.
9.3.7 Oxygen
In modern oxygen steelmaking processes a water-cooled lance is used to inject oxygen at very high
velocities onto a molten bath to produce steel. With the increasing demands to produce higher qual-
ity steels with lower impurity levels, oxygen of very high purity must be supplied. Therefore, the
oxygen for steelmaking must be at least 99.5% pure, and ideally 99.7 to 99.8% pure. The remain-
ing parts are 0.005 to 0.01% nitrogen and the rest is argon.1
In top-blown converters, the oxygen is jetted at supersonic velocities (Mach>1) with convergent-
divergent nozzles at the tip of the water-cooled lance. A forceful gas jet penetrates the slag and
impinges onto the metal surface to refine the steel. Today, most BOFs operate with lance tips con-
taining four to five nozzles and oxygen flow rates, (in 230 to 300 ton converters), that range from
640 to 900 Nm3/min (22,500 to 31,500 scfm).7 Figure 9.6 shows an schematic of a typical five-
nozzle lance tip. The tip is made of a high thermal conductivity cast copper alloy with precisely
machined nozzles to achieve the desired jet parameters. The nozzles are angled about 12° to the
centerline of the lance pipe and
equally spaced around the tip.
The tip is welded to a 12 inch
seamless steel pipe (lance bar-
rel) about 60 feet long. Cooling
water is essential in these lances
to keep them from burning up in
the furnace. At the top of the
lance, armored rubber hoses are
connected to a pressure-regu-
lated oxygen source and to a
supply of recirculated cooling
water. Details of the conver-
gent-divergent nozzles are also
shown in Fig. 9.6. As the oxy-
gen passes the converging sec-
tion it is accelerated and reaches
sonic velocity (Mach =1) in the
cylindrical throat section. Then
it expands in the diverging sec-

tion and its temperature and pressure decreases while its velocity increases to supersonic levels
(Mach > 1). The supersonic jets are at an angle of about 12° so that they do not interfere with each
other.
In bottom-blown converters, the oxygen is injected through the bottom of the vessel using a series
of tuyeres. About 14 to 22 tuyeres are used to blow about 4.0 to 4.5 Nm3 of oxygen per minute per
ton of steel.8 Powdered lime, mixed with the oxygen, is usually injected through the liquid bath to
improve lime dissolution and hence slag formation during the blow. The tuyeres consist of two con-
centric pipes, where oxygen flows through the center pipe and a hydrocarbon fluid, such as natural
gas or propane, used as a coolant, flows through the annular space between both pipes.
9.4 Process Reactions and Energy Balance
9.4.1 Refining Reactions in BOF Steelmaking
In the oxygen steelmaking process, impurities such as carbon (C), silicon (Si), and manganese
(Mn) dissolved in the hot metal are removed by oxidation to produce liquid steel. Hot metal and
scrap are charged into the furnace and high-purity oxygen gas is injected at high flow rates, through
a lance or tuyeres, to react with the metal bath. The oxygen injection process, known as the blow,
lasts for about 16 to 25 minutes and the oxidation reactions result in the formation of CO, CO2,
SiO2, MnO, and iron oxides. Most of these oxides are dissolved with the fluxes added to the fur-
nace, primarily lime (CaO), to form a liquid slag that is able to remove sulfur (S) and phosphorus
(P) from the metal. The gaseous oxides, composed of about 90% CO and 10% CO2, exit the fur-
nace carrying small amounts of iron oxide and lime dust. Typical oxygen flow rates during the blow
range between 2–3.5 Nm3 per minute per ton of steel (70–123 scfm per ton), and in general the rate
of oxygen injection is limited either by the capacity of the hood and gas cleaning system or by the
available oxygen pressure 
The commercial success of oxygen steelmaking is mainly due to two important characteristics.
First, the process is autogenous meaning that no external heat sources are required. The oxidation
reactions during the blow provide the
energy necessary to melt the fluxes and
scrap, and achieve the desired tempera-
ture of the steel product. Second, the
process is capable of refining steel at
high production rates. The fast reaction
rates are due to the extremely large sur-
face area available for reactions. When
oxygen is injected onto the metal bath a
tremendous amount of gas is evolved
forming an emulsion with the liquid
slag and with metal droplets sheared
from the bath surface by the impinge-
ment of the oxygen jet.10 This gas-
metal-slag emulsion, shown in Fig. 9.7,
generates large surface areas that
increase the rates of the refining reac-
tions. The reaction mechanisms and the
slag-metal reactions are discussed in
detail in Chapter 2. Therefore, only a
brief discussion of the sequence of
these reactions during the blow are pro-
vided in this section.

9.4.1.1 Carbon Oxidation
Decarburization is the most extensive and important reaction during oxygen steelmaking. About
4.5 wt% carbon in the hot metal is oxidized to CO and CO2 during the oxygen blow, and steel with
less than 0.1 wt% carbon is produced. The change in the carbon content during the blow is illus-
trated in Fig. 9.8,11 which shows three distinct stages. The first stage, occurring during the first few
minutes of the blow, shows a slow decarburization rate as nearly all the oxygen supplied reacts with
the silicon in the metal. The second stage, occurring at high carbon contents in the metal, shows a
constant higher rate of decarburization and its controlled by the rate of supplied oxygen. Finally,
the third stage occurs at carbon contents below about 0.3 wt.%, where the decarburization rate
drops as carbon becomes less available to react with all the oxygen supplied. At this stage, the rate
is controlled by mass transfer of carbon, and the oxygen will mostly react with iron to form iron
oxide. Also in this stage, the generation of CO drops and the flame over the mouth of the furnace
becomes less luminous, and practically disappears below about 0.1 wt.% carbon.
9.4.1.2 Silicon Oxidation
The strong affinity of oxygen for Silicon will result in the removal of almost all the Si early in the
blow. The Si dissolved in the hot metal (0.25–1.3 wt.%) is oxidized to very low levels (<0.005
wt.%) in the first three to five minutes of the blow as shown in Fig. 9.8. The oxidation of Si to sil-
ica (SiO2) is exothermic producing significant amounts of heat which raises the temperature of the
bath. It also forms a silicate slag that reacts with the added lime (CaO) and dolomitic lime (MgO)
to form the basic steelmaking slag. The amount of Si in the hot metal is very important since its
oxidation is a major heat source to the process and it strongly affects the amount of scrap that can
be melted. It also determines the slag volume and consequently affects the iron yield and dephos-
phorization of the metal. In general, more slag causes less yield but lower phosphorus. 
9.4.1.3 Manganese Oxidation
The reaction involving the oxidation of Manganese in steelmaking is complex. In top-blown
processes Mn is oxidized to MnO early in the blow and after most of the silicon has been oxidized,
the Mn reverts into the metal.12 Finally, as shown in Fig. 9.8, towards the end of the blow the Mn
in the metal decreases as more oxygen is available for its oxidation.  In bottom-blown processes,
such as the OBM (Q-BOP), a similar pattern is found, but the residual Mn content of the steel is
higher than for top-blown processes due to better stirring.13,14

9.4.1.4 Phosphorus Oxidation
Dephosphorization is favored by the oxidizing conditions in the furnace. The dephosphorization
reaction between liquid iron and slag can be expressed by reaction 9.4.1.15 Phosphorus removal is
favored by low temperatures, high slag basicity (high CaO/SiO2 ratio), high slag FeO, high slag flu-
idity, and good stirring.12,15 The change in the phosphorus content of the metal during blow is
shown in Fig. 9.8. The phosphorus in the metal decreases at the beginning of the blow, then it
reverts into the metal when the FeO is reduced during the main decarburization period, and finally
decreases at the end of the blow.12 Stirring improves slag-metal mixing, which increases the rate
of dephosphorization. Good stirring with additions of fluxing agents, such as fluorspar, also
improves dephosphorization by increasing the dissolution of lime, resulting in a highly basic and
fluid liquid slag.

(9.4.1)
9.4.1.5 Sulfur Reaction
The BOF is not very effective for sulfur removal due to its highly oxidizing conditions. Sulfur dis-
tribution ratios in the BOF (% S slag /% S metal ~4–8) are much lower than the ratios in the steel
ladle (% S slag /% S metal ~300–500) during secondary ladle practices. In the BOF, about 10 to
20% of sulfur in the metal reacts directly with oxygen to form gaseous SO2.15 The rest of the sul-
fur is removed by the following slag-metal reaction 
S 1 (CaO) 1 Fe 5 (CaS) 1 (FeO)
(9.4.2)
Sulfur removal by the slag is favored by high slag basicities (high CaO/SiO2 ratio), and low FeO
contents. The final sulfur content of steel is also affected by the sulfur contained in the furnace
charge materials, such as hot metal and scrap. The sulfur content in the hot metal supplied from the
blast furnace generally ranges from 0.020 to 0.040 wt.%, and if the hot metal is desulfurized before
steelmaking the sulfur content in the hot metal can be as low as 0.002 wt.%. Heavy pieces of scrap
containing high sulfur contents must be avoided if low sulfur alloys with less than 60 ppm
(0.006%) of sulfur are being produced. For example a slab crop of 2273 kg (5000 lb.) containing
0.25 wt.% S (12.5 lb. of sulfur) can increase the sulfur content of steel by about 15 ppm (0.0015%)
in a 300 ton BOF.
9.4.2 Slag Formation in BOF Steelmaking
Fluxes are charged into the furnace early in the blow and they dissolve with the developing oxides
to form a liquid slag. The rate of dissolution of these fluxes strongly affects the slag-metal reac-
tions occurring during the blow. Therefore, it is important to understand the evolution of slag dur-
ing the blow. Several investigators have studied slag formation in oxygen steelmaking,16,17 and a
detailed review of these investigations is given by Turkdogan,11 and Deo and Boom.18
At the beginning of the blow, the tip of the oxygen lance is kept high above the bath surface, at
about 3.5 m (12 ft), which results in the formation of an initial slag rich in SiO2 and FeO. During
this period large amounts of burnt lime and dolomitic lime are charged into the furnace. The lance
is then lowered and the slag starts to foam at around one third of the blow due to the reduction of
the FeO in the slag in conjunction with CO formation. The drop in the FeO content in the slag is
shown in Fig. 9.9. Also, as the blow progresses, the CaO dissolves in the slag, and the active slag
weight increases. Finally, after three quarters into the blow, the FeO content in the slag increases
because of a decrease in the rate of decarburization. The resulting slag at turndown in top-blown
converters (BOF or BOP) have typical ranges: 42–55 wt.% CaO, 2–8 wt.% MgO, 10–30 wt.%
FeOT, 3–8 wt.% MnO, 10–25 wt.% SiO2, 1–5 wt.% P2O5, 1–2 wt.% Al2O3, 0.1–0.3 wt.% S. In the
OBM (Q-BOP) or bottom-blown converter, the total FeO in the turndown slag is lower, ranging
between 4–22 wt.%
During the blow, the temperature of the metal gradually increases from about 1350°C (2450°F) to
1650°C (3000°F) at turndown, and the slag temperature is about 50°C (120°F) higher than that of

the metal.19 The slag at turndown may contain regions of undissolved lime mixed with the liquid
slag, since the dissolution of lime is limited by the presence of dicalcium silicate (2CaO•SiO2)
coating, which is solid at steelmaking temperatures and prevents rapid dissolution.11 The presence
of MgO in the lime weakens the coating. Thus, charging MgO early speeds up slag forming due to
quicker solution of lime.
9.4.3 Mass and Energy Balances
As shown in Fig. 9.10, hot metal, scrap, and iron ore are charged with the fluxes, such as burnt and
dolomitic lime, into the furnace. Oxygen is injected at high flow rates and gases, such as CO and
CO2, and iron oxide fumes (Fe2O3) exit from the mouth of the furnace. At turndown, liquid steel
and slag are the remaining products of the process. The oxidation reactions occurring during the
blow produce more energy than required to simply raise the temperature of the hot metal, from
about 1350°C (2450°F) to the desired turndown temperature, and to melt the fluxes. Most of the
excess heat is used to increase the amount of steel produced by melting cold scrap and by reduc-
ing iron ore to metal. Some heat is also lost by conduction, convection, and radiation to the sur-
roundings. 
It is important to exactly determine the amount of each material to charge and the amount of oxy-
gen to blow to produce steel of desired temperature and chemistry. The specific method for deter-
mining these amounts varies with each BOF shop; however, in general these computations are
based on mass and energy balance calculations. A simple mass and energy balance is presented in
this text for illustration purposes. A more detailed treatment can be found in the literature.1
Consider the production of 1000 kg of steel. Fluxes, such as burnt and dolomitic lime, are added
to the furnace with the iron ore early in the blow. Before any calculation can be made it is required
to specify the compositions and temperatures of the input materials, such as hot metal, scrap, iron
ore, and fluxes, and also the temperature and chemistry specifications of the steel product. Table
9.7 shows typical compositions. The sequence of calculations required to determine the amounts
of input materials necessary to produce 1000 kg of steel product is summarized as follows:

9.4.3.1 Determination of the Flux Additions
The fluxes added to the process strongly depend on the hot metal silicon, the weight of hot metal,
the lime to silica ratio (%CaO/%SiO2), and the amount of MgO needed in the slag to avoid the wear
of furnace refractories. The lime to silica ratio should range from two to four to achieve a basic slag
during the blow. Also, approximately 6–12 wt.% of MgO is required, depending on slag temperature
and chemistry, to saturate the slag and consequently retard dissolution of the furnace refractories.7

For a typical lime to silica ratio of four, each kg of SiO2 in the slag requires 4 kg of CaO. For the
example shown in Table 9.8, about 11.26 kg (24.78 lb.) of SiO2 are produced from the oxidation of
the hot metal silicon, and 47.92 kg (105.42 lb.) of CaO per metric ton of steel are required to neu-
tralize the SiO2 in the slag. The amounts of burnt lime and dolomitic lime needed are computed from
the CaO and MgO requirements as shown in Table 9.8. In actual BOF operations, higher dolomitic
lime additions are made than those predicted by the present example to ensure MgO saturation.
9.4.3.2 Determination of Oxygen Requirements
The volume of oxygen gas blown into the converter must be sufficient to oxidize the C, Si, Mn,
and P during the blow, and it is computed from an oxygen balance as shown below. For the present

9.4.3.3 Determination of the Weight of Iron-Bearing Materials
In general four distinct iron-bearing materials are involved in oxygen steelmaking: hot metal,
scrap, iron ore, and the steel product. Slag and fume are usually considered heat and iron losses.
The simultaneous solution of an iron mass balance and an energy balance permits the determina-
tion of the weights of two of the iron-bearing materials with a knowledge of the weights of the other
two. For the example here, the product weight (1000 kg), and the weight of the iron ore (16.8 kg)
are assumed to be known. Then the weights of the hot metal and scrap are computed to be 877.64
kg (1930.8 lb.) and 201.55 kg (443.41 lb.) respectively from the mass and energy balance shown
below:
Mass balance for iron: (IRON INPUT = IRON OUTPUT)
(9.4.4)
Heat balance: (HEAT INPUT = HEAT OUTPUT)
(9.4.5)
The heat added to the process comes from the heat content or enthalpy in the hot metal charged
into the furnace at about 1343°C (2450°F), the heats of oxidation of elements, such as Fe, C, Si,
Mn, P, and S, whose enthalpies are shown in Table 9.9, and the heats of formation of the different
compounds in the slag.

These sources will provide the heat necessary to raise temperature of the steel and slag to the aim
turndown temperature, and also to heat up the gases and fumes leaving the furnace. Furthermore,
there is enough energy generated to overcome the heat losses during the process, to heat and melt
coolants such as scrap and iron ore, and to reduce the iron oxide in the ore.
9.4.3.4 Determination of the Gases and Fumes Produced
The amounts of CO and CO2 produced from decarburization are determined from a mass balance
for carbon. The carbon removed from the bath is converted to approximately 90% CO and 10%
CO2. With the gases about 1 to 1.5 wt.% of iron is lost in the form of iron oxide fumes that exit
from the mouth of the furnace.
9.4.3.5 Determination of the FeO in the Slag
The FeO in the slag is generally determined from empirical correlations, developed by each shop,
between the slag FeO and the aim carbon and the lime to silica ratio. Other parameters are gener-
ally of much lower significance. This empirical relationship is one of the larger error sources in a
material and energy balance algorithm, arising from analytical errors of iron oxides and slag sam-
ple preparation problems. 
9.4.4 Tapping Practices and Ladle Additions
When the blow is completed, the lance is removed from the furnace and the vessel is rotated to a
horizontal position towards the charging side for sampling. A steel sample is withdrawn from the
bath for chemical analysis, and an expendable immersion-type thermocouple is used to measure
the temperature of the melt. The steel sample is analyzed with a mass spectrometer, and the con-
centrations of the elements present in the steel are determined in approximately three to five min-
utes. If the steel is too hot, meaning that the measured temperature is higher than the aim
temperature, it can be cooled by rocking the vessel, or by adding coolants such as iron ore or lime-
stone. If the steel is too cold, or if the measured concentrations of elements such as carbon, phos-
phorus, and sulfur are higher than the aim concentrations specified, additional oxygen is blown into
the furnace (reblow) for approximately one to three minutes. Once the heat meets the temperature
and chemistry requirements, the furnace is rotated towards the taphole side and the steel is tapped
or poured into a ladle.
Tapping a 300 ton heat takes from four to seven minutes and the time strongly depends on the con-
ditions or diameter of the taphole. A good tapping practice is necessary to maximize yield, or the
amount of steel poured into the ladle. Slag carryover from the BOF into the ladle must be mini-
mized. Furnace slag contains high FeO, which reduces desulfurization in the ladle, and enhances the
formation of alumina inclusions. Also, the P2O5 present in BOF slags is a source of phosphorus car-
ried into the ladle. Therefore, over the years, extensive work has been done to develop slag free tap-
ping techniques, and the most commonly used are described here. Good tap hole maintenance,
combined with the ability of the operator to rotate the furnace quick enough when all the steel has
been tapped, will reduce the amount of slag carryover into the ladle. Slag free tapping devices are
now commonly used to help the operators reduce slag carryover. Different types of taphole plugs,
such as balls and darts, (discussed earlier in section 9.2.2.12) shown in Fig. 9.11, are dropped into
the furnace at tap. These Devices float at the slag-metal interface, and plug the taphole when the
steel has emptied but before the slag can exit the furnace. There has been much debate over the
effectiveness of these devices. Electromagnetic slag detection sensors installed around the taphole
will detect the presence of slag in the stream and send a signal to alarm the furnace operator. One
of the problems with these devices is that they can give false alarms from slag entrainment within
the vortex of the steel stream and they require maintaining a taper in the taphole to work well.
With current steelmaking alloying practices, most of the alloys are added to the ladle. However,
large amounts of non-oxidizable alloys such as nickel, molybdenum and copper are usually charged
with the scrap as they resist oxidation during the blow. This practice will prevent big temperature

drops in the ladle. In aluminum killed
steels aluminum (Al) is used to deoxidize
the steel and reduce the dissolved oxygen
from approximately 500–1000 ppm to less
than 5 ppm, and is generally the first addi-
tion made into the ladle during tap. For
example, a heat with a Celox reading of
750 ppm of dissolved oxygen requires
approximately 365 kg (800 lb.) of alu-
minum at tap. In semi-killed steels, deoxi-
dation is done with ferrosilicon, and the
dissolved oxygen in steel is only lowered to
about 50 ppm. Burnt lime is also added
with the aluminum to satisfy a lime to alu-
mina (CaO/Al2O3) ratio of 0.8 to 1.2. This
produces a liquid slag over the molten
metal that thermally insulates the melt to
avoid excess temperature losses, protects
the melt from reoxidation from air, desul-
furizes the steel, and removes alumina
inclusions from the melt.
Ferromanganese is added via chutes located
over the ladle, in large quantities, after the
steel has been deoxidized by aluminum or
silicon. The general rule of thumb is that
the aluminum is added when the melt
reaches approximately 1/3 of the ladle’s height, and all the alloys should be added by the time the
melt reaches 2/3 of the full ladle height. Slag modifiers, containing about 50 wt.% aluminum, are
added to the slag near the end of tap to reduce the FeO content in the ladle slag originating from
furnace slag carryover. Chapter 11 contains a detailed discussion of the refining processes occur-
ring in the ladle after steelmaking.
9.5 Process Variations
9.5.1 The Bottom-Blown Oxygen Steelmaking or OBM (Q-BOP) Process
The successful development and application of the shrouded oxygen tuyere in the late 1960s led to
the development of the OBM (Q-BOP) process in the early 1970s. Oxygen in this process is injected
into the bath through tuyeres inserted in the bottom of the furnace. Each tuyere is made from two
concentric tubes forming an inner nozzle and an outer annulus. Oxygen and powdered lime are
injected through the central portion of the tuyeres, while a hydrocarbon gas, typically natural gas or
propane, is injected through the annular section between the two concentric pipes, as shown in Fig.
9.12. The endothermic decomposition of the hydrocarbon gas and the sensible heat required to bring
the products of the decomposition up to steelmaking temperatures result in localized cooling at the
tip of the tuyere. The localized cooling is enough to chill the liquid metal and form a porous mush-
room on the tip of the tuyere and part of the surrounding refractory. This mushroom reduces the burn
back rate of the tuyere, and the wear of the surrounding refractory.  The injected lime provides addi-
tional cooling to the tuyere, and results in better slag refining characteristics.
Top lances in OBM (Q-BOP) furnaces have also been adopted, mainly for the purposes of increas-
ing the post-combustion of the offgases within the furnace, and to control the buildup of slag and
metal in the furnace cone area. Top lances used in OBM (Q-BOP) furnaces are normally station-
ary, since they are not used for refining purposes. Tuyeres, located in the upper cone area of fur-
naces with a heat size larger than approximately 150 tonnes have also been used, but typically

result in higher refractory wear. For this reason, their application has been limited to shops which
require increased scrap melting capabilities (resulting in shorter lining lives), and with a heat size
smaller than 150 tonnes.
9.5.1.1 Plant Equipment
The injection of oxygen through the bottom in the OBM (Q-BOP) process, with a fraction of the
total oxygen through a stationary top lance, results in the need for a low building, and consequently
in lower greenfield construction costs.
Oxygen, a hydrocarbon fluid (natural gas or propane), nitrogen and argon are gases used in the
OBM (Q-BOP) process. These gases are metered and controlled, and introduced through rotary
joints located in the trunnion pins. The oxygen, aside from being used as the main process gas, is
also used as the transport gas for the pulverized burnt lime. A high-pressure injector contains the
burnt lime, which is transported by the oxygen through one of the trunnion pins into a lime and
oxygen distributor, and then to the individual tuyeres in the furnace bottom. The hydrocarbon fluid
is transported to the bottom of the furnace through the opposite trunnion, to avoid the possibility
of leakage and of its mixing with oxygen in the transport line. The hydrocarbon fluid is then dis-
tributed to each tuyere. In some instances, the flow of the hydrocarbon fluid is controlled individ-
ually for each tuyere prior to entering the rotary joint. Nitrogen is used to protect the tuyeres from
plugging during furnace rotation. It can also be used to increase the nitrogen content in the steel.
Argon can be used to minimize the nitrogen pickup in the steel, and to produce lower carbon steels
than in the BOF process, without excessive yield losses, and with low FeO contents in the slag.
Gas flow through the tuyeres has to be maintained above sonic flow to prevent penetration of steel
into the tuyeres, and subsequent plugging. For this reason, the sonic flow is maintained during rota-
tion of the furnace for turndown and for tapping of the steel. The ejections of metal and slag result-
ing from the injection of this high flow through the tuyeres during rotation, require the complete
enclosure of the OBM (Q-BOP) furnaces. Movable doors are used in the charge side for this pur-
pose. The complete enclosure also results in lower fugitive emissions during turndown and tapping
than in the BOF furnaces, which usually are not enclosed.

Fig. 9.12 Schematic drawing of an OBM (Q-BOP) tuyere.

Typically 12 to 18 tuyeres are used in the bottom, depending on the furnace capacity. The tuyeres
are located in the refractory bottom on two rows that run from one trunnion to the other. The loca-
tions of these two rows are selected so that they are above the slag line during turndown and tap-
ping to allow the reduction of the gas flow during these periods. The inside of the inner pipe of the
tuyere is typically lined with a mullite sleeve to prevent excessive wear of the pipe by the burnt
lime. The inside diameter of the ceramic liner is 1 to 1.5 inches. Stainless steel is normally used
for the inner pipe, and carbon steel for the outer pipe, although copper has also been used.
The higher refractory wear observed in the vicinity of the tuyeres, due to the high temperature gra-
dients experienced by the refractories during a heat cycle and the high temperature generated
around them, results in bottom lives of 800 to 2500 heats, depending on tap temperature, turndown
carbon content, etc. Since barrel lives approach 4000 to 6000 heats, the furnace is designed to
include a replaceable bottom. When the bottom thickness is too thin for safe operation, it is
removed and a bottom with new refractories and tuyeres is installed. The furnace can be back in
operation with a new bottom in less than 24 hours.
9.5.1.2 Raw Materials
A distinct advantage of the OBM (Q-BOP) process is its capability to melt bigger and thicker
pieces of scrap than the BOF process. Sections with thicknesses of up to two feet are melted rou-
tinely. This expands significantly the types of scrap that can be used, and lowers their preparation
costs.  There is no unmelted scrap at the end of the blow in the OBM (Q-BOP) process.
The burnt lime used for slag formation is pulverized and screened to less than 0.1 millimeters. It is
sometimes treated to improve its flowability during pneumatic transport with oxygen. The dolomitic
lime in the OBM (Q-BOP) process is essentially similar to that used in the BOF process, and is
charged through top bins, if available. In shops where overhead bins are not available, a pulverized
blend of burnt lime and dolomitic lime is injected through the bottom tuyeres to achieve the desired
MgO content in the slag. The rest of the raw materials are the same as for the BOF process.
9.5.1.3  Sequence of Operations
After the steel is tapped, the furnace is rotated to the vertical position, and nitrogen is blown to
splash the slag onto the furnace walls. This results in a coating that extends the life of the furnace
barrel. The furnace is also rocked to coat the bottom with slag. This operation can be done with the
slag as is, or with conditioned slag. The furnace is then ready to receive the scrap and hot metal.
Nitrogen is injected at sonic flow to protect the tuyeres during the hot metal charge. The furnace is
rotated to its vertical position, and the bottom and top oxygen blow are started. Burnt lime is
injected with the oxygen through the bottom, and the dolomitic lime is added through the top at
the beginning of the blow. Typically the lime is injected within the first half of the oxygen blow.
When the calculated oxygen amount has been injected, the gas is switched to nitrogen or argon and
the furnace is rotated for sampling. A sample for chemical analysis is taken, and the temperature
and oxygen activity are measured. If the desired temperature and chemistry have been obtained, the
heat can then be tapped. If necessary, small adjustments in temperature and chemistry can be made
by injecting additional oxygen through the bottom, by injecting more lime, or by cooling the heat
with ore or raw dolomite. Since the process is very reproducible, the heat is normally tapped after
these adjustments, without making another temperature measurement or taking another sample for
chemical analysis. Shops so equipped can take a sample for chemical analysis, temperature and
carbon content measurement with sub lances a few minutes before the end of the oxygen blow. Any
necessary adjustments can be made during the blow to obtain the aim steel temperature and chem-
istry. The turndown step can thus be avoided, decreasing the tap-to-tap time, and increasing the pro-
ductivity of the shop.
9.5.1.4 Process Characteristics
The injection of the oxygen and hydrocarbons through bottom tuyeres results in distinct process char-
acteristics. The oxygen reacts directly with the carbon and silicon in the liquid iron melt, resulting in

lower oxidation levels in the metal and slag at the end of the blow. The bottom injection also results
in very strong bath mixing. Steel decarburization is enhanced by the strong bath agitation, particu-
larly during the last portion of the blow, when mass transfer of the carbon in the melt controls the rate
of decarburization at carbon contents below 0.3%. This results in less iron being oxidized and lost to
the slag, as shown in Fig. 9.13, and in less dissolved oxygen in the steel at turndown, as shown in Fig.
9.14. The manganese content at turndown is also higher than in the top-blown vessels, as shown in
Fig. 9.15, due to the lower bath and slag oxidation. The variability in blow behavior introduced by the
top lance in top-blown vessels is eliminated. By injecting the oxygen and lime through the bottom
tuyeres in a controlled manner, a highly reproducible process control is obtained.
9.5.1.5 Product Characteristics
In general, the same steel grades that can be produced in top-blown vessels can be produced by the
OBM (Q-BOP). Additionally, the better mixing attained in the bath allows the production of steels
with carbon contents of 0.015–0.020% without excessive bath and slag oxidation and without vac-
uum decarburization. The slightly higher hydrogen contents obtained at turndown can be lowered
by flushing the bath with nitrogen, argon, or a mixture of argon and oxygen at the end of the blow.
For the production of low-nitrogen steels, argon can be used to minimize the nitrogen pickup dur-
ing rotation, or by flushing the bath at the end of the blow. Nitrogen can also be alloyed into the
steel by purging the melt with nitrogen at the end of the oxygen blow.
9.5.2 Mixed-Blowing Processes
Virtually every company has invented or modified a version of the oxygen steelmaking process to
suit its own situation. Consequently, there are many designations for fairly similar processes.  Table
9.10 attempts to translate and relate some of the more common acronyms. This table is divided into
four broad categories: top blowing, mixed blowing with inert gases, mixed blowing with bottom
oxygen, and bottom blowing.

The BOF is the overwhelmingly popular process selection for oxygen steelmaking. The usual rea-
son to modify the BOF configuration is to lower the operating cost through better stirring action
in the steel bath. It has been found by a number of companies and investigators that additional stir-
ring of the bath from the furnace bottom reduces FeO in the slag. Lower FeO results in higher yield,
and fewer oxidation losses of metallics. Bottom stirring increases slag forming, particularly if pow-
dered limes are injected into the bath.
9.5.2.1 Bottom Stirring Practices
Inhomogenieties in chemical composition and temperature are created in the melt during the oxy-
gen blow in the top-blown BOF25 process due to lack of proper mixing in the metal bath. There is
a relatively dead zone directly underneath the jet cavity in the BOF.

(Note: Bold lettered processes are still in regular use today.)

Bottom stirring practices using inert gases such as nitrogen and argon are being used extensively
to improve the mixing conditions in the BOF. The inert gases are introduced at the bottom of the
furnace by means of permeable elements (LBE process) or tuyeres. In a typical practice, nitrogen
gas is introduced through tuyeres or permeable elements in the first 60 to 80% of the oxygen blow,
and argon gas is switched on in the last 40 to 20% of the blow. The rapid evolution of CO  in the
first part of the  oxygen blow prevents nitrogen pickup in the steel. 
Some of the effects of bottom stirring and the resulting improved mixing include:
(a)  Decreased FeO content in slag. Better mixing conditions in the vessel causes the
FeO in the slag to be closer to equilibrium conditions, which results in lower con-
centrations of FeO in the slag. Plant studies have shown that for low carbon heats,
bottom stirring can cause a reduction in the FeO level in slag by approximately 5%.
This results in better metallic yield, lower FeO level in the ladle slag and reduced
slag attack on the refractories. Improvements in iron yield by as much as 1.5% or
more have been reported.26 Lower levels of FeO in the steelmaking slag reduces the
amount of heat generated during the oxygen blow, and hence reduces the maximum
amount of scrap that can be charged in a heat.
(b)  Reduced dissolved oxygen in metal. A study shows that bottom stirring can reduce the
dissolved oxygen level in a low carbon heat by approximately 225 ppm. This lower-
ing of dissolved oxygen leads to lower aluminum consumption in the ladle. Studies
have shown aluminum savings of about 0.3 lb./ton due to bottom stirring.
(c)  Higher manganese content in the metal at turndown. An increase of approximately
0.03% in the turndown manganese content of the metal has been shown. This leads
to a reduction in the consumption of ferro-manganese.
(d)  Sulfur and Phosphorus removal. Bottom stirring has been found to enhance desul-
furization due to improved stirring. However, phosphorus removal has not been
found to improve substantially in some studies. Although bottom stirring drives the
dephosphorization reaction towards equilibrium, the reduced levels of FeO in steel-
making slags tend to decrease the equilibrium phosphorus partition ratio ((%P in
slag)/[%P in metal]).
9.5.2.2 Bottom Stirring Maintenance Problems
The price for the bottom stirring benefits is in maintaining a more complicated process. This com-
plexity varies depending on the type of bottom stirring devices installed. Generally, the simpler the
device is to maintain, the lesser is the benefit obtained.
Starting at the simple end, porous plugs or permeable elements do not require maintaining gas pres-
sure when the stirring action is not required. While gas under pressure can permeate these devices,
steel does not penetrate, even when the gas is turned off. The disadvantage of the porous plugs is
that they are not very effective stirrers. Two factors influence their poor performance.  First, only
a relatively small amount of gas can be introduced per plug. More gas flow requires more plugs
thus adding complexity. Secondly, if the furnace bottom tends to build up, the plugs are covered
over with a lime/slag mush and gas does not stir the steel bath. Rather, it escapes between the bricks
and the protective mush. Another problem is at higher flow rates, the originally installed plugs do
not last very long (1500 to 3000 heats) and replacements are shorter lived (200 to 2000 heats). The
reasons for the shorter replacement plug life is not clear.
The use of the bottom stirring tuyeres (rather than plugs) can lead to stirring reliability and effec-
tiveness problems. The tuyeres are known to get blocked early in the lining campaign when there
is a buildup at the bottom of the furnace. The tuyere blockage can be prevented by maintaining
proper gas flow rates through the tuyeres at different stages of the heat, by using high quality
refractory bricks in the area surrounding the stirring elements or tuyeres, and by properly main-
taining the bottom of the furnace by minimizing buildup.

9.5.2.3 Bottom Plug/Nozzle Configurations
There are basically three types of tuyeres used for mixed blowing. First, there is a refractory ele-
ment that behaves much like porous plugs. This unit is made of compacted bricks with small slits.
Like most tuyeres, it needs sufficient gas pressure to prevent steel penetration. This unit is more
penetrating than porous plugs. Second, an uncooled tuyere is used to introduce large amounts of
inert gases per nozzle. This results in local heavy stirring, which can more easily penetrate the
buildup. Air or oxygen cannot be used because there is no coolant and the heat generated would
make tuyere life too short to be practical. The third type is a fully cooled tuyere similar to the OBM
(Q-BOP). Here, either inert gas or oxygen can be blown, causing very strong stirring and almost
no problems penetrating bottom buildup.
In all cases the gas piping is routed through the furnace trunnions using rotary joints or seals to
allow full rotation of the furnace.
9.5.3 Oxygen Steelmaking Practice Variations
9.5.3.1 Post-Combustion Lance Practices
Post combustion involves burning the CO gas produced by the reaction of carbon in the metal
with jet oxygen, to CO2 within the furnace. The heat generated as a result of this oxidation reac-
tion can be used for any of the following purposes: (1) to increase the scrap-to-hot metal ratio, (2)
to minimize the formation of skulls formed at the mouth of the vessel, (3) to minimize the for-
mation of lance skulls and (4) to reduce the formation of “kidney” skulls in the upper cone region
inside the BOF.
In a normal BOF operation, the percentage of CO in the off gas is approximately 80 to 90% dur-
ing the middle portion of the blow, when the rate of decarburization is maximum, Fig. 9.16.27 The
oxidation of the CO gas to CO2 generates 12 Mcal per Nm3 CO (1260 BTU per scf CO)), which
can melt more scrap and/or reduce skulling problems. 
Post combustion lances have primary nozzles as well as secondary nozzles which typically are
located at about nine feet from the tip of the lance, Fig. 9.17. The primary nozzles in PC lances are
identical to those of the standard lances. They consist of four or five nozzles at the tip of the lance
with inclination angles varying from 10 to 14 degrees. Usually, there are eight secondary nozzles
above the primary ones, directed out, at an angle of about 35 degrees from the vertical. The oxy-
gen flow rate through the secondary nozzles is considerably less than through the primary ones,
usually 1.5 to 15% of the total oxygen flow.

Studies show that post combustion
has been successfully used to melt
additional scrap in the BOF (achiev-
ing scrap-to-hot metal ratios of 25%
or more), and to reduce lance and
furnace mouth skulling problems. It
has been found to increase the turn-
down temperature, if additional
scrap or coolant is not added, to
compensate for the extra heat gener-
ated. No effect on slag FeO28 and
turndown manganese in metal has
been found. There has been no
effect on refractories when post-
combustion is used at low flow rates
in the skull control mode. However,
if post-combustion is used in high
flow, scrap melting mode, some care
in design and operating parameters
must be observed to avoid damag-
ing the cone.
9.5.3.2 High Scrap Melting Practices
The ability to vary the scrap-to-hot metal ratio in a BOF is important because of the variations in
scrap prices and the possibility of having hot metal shortages from time to time due to problems in
the blast furnace. Several shops add anthracite coal early in the oxygen blow as an additional fuel
to melt more of scrap. Such processes can be used in conjunction with post combustion lances. 
A recent example of the scrap stretch is a series of steelmaking processes called Z-BOP that were
developed  in Russia to melt higher scrap charge.29,30 These processes include Z-BOP-30, Z-BOP-
50, Z-BOP-75 and Z-BOP-100, where the numbers indicate the percentage of scrap charge in the
BOP. The Z-BOP-100 process utilizes 100% scrap charge with no hot metal, using the conventional
BOP with virtually no equipment modifications.
In the Z-BOP processes, the additional energy required to melt scrap comes from lump coal
(anthracite and high volatile bituminous), which can be fed using a bin system. In the Z-BOP-100
process, the first batch of scrap is fed into the furnace using a scrap box, and coal is added in small
batches while blowing oxygen. This process continues with additional scrap being charged. The
number of scrap boxes charged can vary from three to five. The main blow commences when all
the scrap is charged in the furnace, and small additions of coal are made throughout the main blow.
The typical tap-to-tap time for the Z-BOP-100 process is 64 to 72 minutes. No one has used these
high scrap percent processes on a sustained basis because of damage to the furnace linings. Typical
iron yield of the Z-BOP 100 process is about 80%, (91–92% is normal for the BOF) and the slag
FeO content is very high (45 to 72%; normal for the BOF is approximately 25%). The sulfur con-
tent of tapped steel was not found to be higher than that of the scrap itself.
The major disadvantages of this process include decreased yield, increased slag FeO which can
adversely affect the refractory lining, presence of tramp elements similar to EAF, and presence of
fugitive emissions (SO2 and NOx). This process may be used during hot metal shortages, but is not
proven for continuous use. Some shops have used a 70% or 80% scrap charge to accommodate a
blast furnace reline and stretch a limited amount of hot metal from the remaining blast furnace(s).
9.5.3.3 Slag Splashing Refractory Maintenance
Any improvement in the furnace lining life is a boon for steelmakers due to the increased furnace
availability and reduced refractory costs. Slag splashing is a technology which uses high pressure

nitrogen through the oxygen lance after
tapping the heat, and splashes the
remaining slag onto the refractory lining,
Fig. 9.18. The slag coating thus formed
cools and solidifies on the existing
refractory, and serves as the consumable
refractory coating in the next heat.
Slag splashing is currently being used by
several BOF shops, and has extended
refractory lining life to record levels. A
typical slag splash operation following
the tapping of a heat is as follows:
1. The melter observes the slag,
and determines whether any
conditioning material such as
limestone, dolomite or coal
must be added. High FeO lev-
els in the slag (estimated by a
simple correlation with turn-
down carbon and manganese
values) are undesirable, and these slags are either not splashed or are treated with
conditioners to make them more viscous.
2. The vessel is rocked back and forth to coat the charge and tap pads. The furnace is
then uprighted.
3. The nitrogen blow is started when the oxygen lance is lowered in the furnace to a
predetermined height. The positioning of the lance and the duration of the nitrogen
blow are determined by the melter, and depend on the condition of the slag and the
area of the furnace that has to be coated.
4. At the end of the nitrogen blow, the furnace is tilted and excess slag is dumped into
the slag pot.
Not only has slag splashing been successful in increasing the furnace lining life, but it has also sig-
nificantly reduced the gunning costs. One major company has reported a reduction in gunning cost
by 66%, and an increase in furnace availability from 78 to 97%. No detrimental effects on the turn-
down performance (chemical and thermal accuracy) of the furnace have been found.
Slag splashing has reduced the frequency of furnace relines considerably. This creates a problem
in maintaining hoods, which is normally done during long furnace reline periods. Now, planned
outages are needed for hood maintenance without any work on the furnace lining. 
9.5.3.4 Effects of Desulfurized vs. Non-Desulfurized Hot Metal
Generally, heats that are made for sulfur sensitive grades of steel (0.010% or lower) must be desul-
furized. Grades that do not have stringent sulfur specifications (approximately 0.018%) may not
require hot metal desulfurization. The high sulfur content of the hot metal (approximately 0.06%)
has to be reduced to acceptable levels in the hot metal desulfurizer, the BOF and/or in the ladle.
The hot metal desulfurizing station can reduce the sulfur levels in the hot metal to as low as 0.001%
through injection of lime and magnesium. 
The BOF is not a very good desulfurizer because of the oxidizing conditions in the furnace. Heats
using non-desulfurized hot metal can be desulfurized to approximately 0.012% sulfur in the BOF.
However, heats using desulfurized hot metal may pick up sulfur if the slag in the desulfurizer was
not skimmed properly or if a high sulfur scrap was used.

Some shops desulfurize virtually 100% of the hot metal to enable the blast furnace to run with a
lower flux charge. This practice also reduces the heat burden on the blast furnace and saves coke.
The net effect is a reduction in hot metal costs that is larger than the expense of desulfurizing.
9.6 Process Control Strategies
9.6.1 Introduction
Process control is an important part of the oxygen steelmaking operation as the heat production
times are affected by it. Several steelmaking process control strategies are available today, and steel
plants use strategies depending on their facilities and needs. Process control schemes can be
broadly divided into two categories: static and dynamic. Static models determine the amount of
oxygen to be blown and the charge to the furnace, given the initial and final information about the
heat, but yield no information about the process variables during the oxygen blow. Static models
are basically like shooting for a hole-in-one on the golf course: there is no further control once the
ball leaves the face of the club. Dynamic models, on the other hand, make adjustments during the
oxygen blow based on certain in-blow measurements. The dynamic system is like a guided missile
in a military situation; there is provision for in-flight correction for better accuracy to hit the target.  
Lance height control is an important factor in any control scheme as it influences the path of the
process reactions. Detailed descriptions of static and dynamic models currently in use by the steel
industry, along with a brief discussion of lance height control, follow.
9.6.2 Static Models
A static charge model is normally a computer program in an on-site steelmaking process computer.
Plants have static models that depend on the type of operation and product mix. The static charge
model uses initial and final information about the heat (e.g. the amount of hot metal and scrap, the
aim carbon and temperature) to calculate the amount of charge and the amount of oxygen required.
The relevant information is collected in the process computer, and a static charge model calcula-
tion is performed at the beginning of the heat. The output from the model determines the amount
of oxygen to be blown and the amount of fluxes to be added to attain the desired (aim) carbon and
temperature for that heat.
Performance of the charge model depends on a number of factors: the accuracy of the model; the
accuracy of the inputs (aims, weights, chemistry of charge ingredients) to the process computer; con-
sistency in the quality of materials used and of practices; and conformance to the static charge model.
The objective of the static charge model is to have improved control of carbon, temperature, sulfur
and phosphorus. An accurate control over these variables using the model will result in fewer
reblows and steel bath cooling, which are time consuming and expensive. Improved control will also
result in better iron yield, greater productivity, better refractory lining life and an overall lower cost
of production. The OBM (Q-BOP) static charge model is essentially the same as the BOF model,
except for slight modifications arising out of differences in slag chemistry and natural gas injection.
Most of the static charge models have an OK-to-tap performance of approximately 50 to 80%.
There is one BOF shop in Europe that achieves over 90% OK-to-tap performance. It is a two-furnace
LBE type shop with inert gas bottom stirring. They use only one furnace at a time while the other is
being relined. Their success is attributable to discipline, attention to detail, pushing the one furnace
very hard which results in consistent heat losses, almost zero furnace maintenance with resultant
short lining lives, and well-developed computer models. Their resulting tap-to-tap times are very
short and production rates are very high. There is no dynamic control system nor sensor sub-lance.
9.6.2.1 Fundamentals of the Static Charge Model
The charge model consists of a comprehensive heat and mass balance involving different chemi-
cal species that participate in the steelmaking reactions. The hot metal poured into the steelmaking

vessel typically contains 4.5%C, 0.5%Si, 0.5%Mn and 0.06%P, apart from other impurities. These
elements, along with Fe, get oxidized during the blow to form gases and slag, and these reactions
generate the heat required to run the steelmaking process. 
The static model also contains information on the heat of oxidation of different elements, such as
carbon and iron, as a function of the oxygen blow. This information, along with a comprehensive
mass balance involving different chemical species, determines the amount of heat generated from
the steelmaking reactions as a function of total oxygen blown. 
The primary coolants used in oxygen steelmaking processes are scrap, iron ore (sintered or lump),
DRI and limestone (or dolomitic stone). The heat generated from the oxidizing reactions must be
balanced with the use of these coolants to achieve the temperature aim of the heat. The model
determines the amount of hot metal and scrap to be charged in the furnace, depending on the size
and the type of heat to be made. 
The rate of decarburization as a function of oxygen (available from the lance as well as from the
ore) must be known to determine the duration of the blow, so that the heat turns down at the desired
carbon level. The model also computes slag basicities (normally in the range of two to five) for
effective dephosphorization and desulfurization. The amount of silica in the slag is calculated from
hot metal silicon, assuming that it gets oxidized entirely to silica. The amount of lime (CaO) to be
added is calculated from the desired basicity and the amount of silica formed from oxidation.
The charge model also determines the amount of dolomitic lime (CaO–MgO) to be charged into
the furnace from an estimate of the overall slag chemistry. It is important to saturate the steelmak-
ing slag with MgO to protect the furnace refractory lining.  
9.6.2.2 Operation of the Static Charge Model
Many different kinds of charge models exist. In one typical model, charge calculations are made
in three separate steps at the beginning of a heat. In the first step, called the hot metal calculation,
the steelmaking operator makes a charge calculation of the amount of hot metal and scrap needed
for the heat, given the product size, and the aim carbon and temperature of the heat. The hot metal
analysis may or may not be available at this time. If not, an estimate based the on previous hot metal
analysis is used.
Having fixed the hot metal and scrap weight, the operator runs the second part of the calculation,
which is called the product calculation. For this, the hot metal analysis is required. The amount of
fluxes to be added and the amount of oxygen to be blown are determined. This part of the calcula-
tion takes place before the start of the oxygen blow.
The third part, the oxygen trim calculation, takes place during the early stages of the oxygen blow
and after the fluxes have been added to the furnace. In this step, the charge model utilizes the actual
amounts of fluxes added to the furnace (which can be different from the calculated amounts), and
provides the new trimmed value of total oxygen. This step is required to correct for any variations
in the process due to weighing inaccuracies in the amount of flux charge.
9.6.3 Statistical and Neural Network Models
Over the last few years, a significant amount of attention has been given to statistical methods
designed to improve the performance of the static charge model. The turn-down performance of the
static model does not only depend on the accuracy of the mass and thermal balance of the steel-
making system, but also on the inherent variability of the process which arises out of a number of
factors that cannot be accurately quantified. Steelmaking melters use the concept of bias adjustments
to correct for unexplained inconsistencies in temperature or carbon performance. For example, if the
melter finds a series of heats that were hot for unexplained reasons, he makes a temperature bias cor-
rection for the following heat, hoping that it will turn down close to the aim temperature. This bias
correction, in effect, alters the aim temperature of the following heat for the purpose of charge cal-
culation. The problem here is that different operators may react to a given situation differently and
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

therefore the manual adjustments lack consistency. In addition, many operators are tempted to tam-
per (make adjustments too frequently), thereby introducing another variable.
Statistical models, in effect, use the same concept of bias to make adjustments in the charge cal-
culation for a heat but do so with better consistency. The model tracks the turn-down performance
of heats, and by statistical means, determines the amount of unexplained deviations in the perfor-
mance of carbon, temperature etc. The model, then instructs the charge model to make appropri-
ate modifications in the inputs for charge calculation for the following heat, so that these
unexplained deviations may be countered. Studies indicate that the statistical models have been
successful in fine tuning the static models to some extent.
Neural network algorithms are also being developed and used to improve the turndown perfor-
mance. In this technique, the dependent variables (such as turndown carbon and temperature) are
linked to the independent variables of a heat (such as the amount of hot metal, scrap and ore)
through a network scheme. The network may consist of a number of layers of nodes, connected to
each other in a linear fashion. As the input signals enter the network, they are multiplied by certain
weights at the nodes and the products are summed as these signals are transferred from one layer
to the next. The weights are determined by training the neural network model based on available
historical data. The outputs from the model are calculated by adding the product of the weights and
the signals in the last layer of the model.37
Researchers have obtained reasonable success in estimating process variables using neural network mod-
eling.38 However, the success of this technique depends on the quality and quantity of input signals that
are fed into the model. In simple terms, the old computer proverb is still valid: “garbage in, garbage out.”
9.6.4 Dynamic Control Schemes
Several steelmaking shops are currently using dynamic control schemes in combination with sta-
tic models to improve their turndown performance. Dynamic control models use in-blow mea-
surements of variables such as carbon and temperature, which can be used in conjunction with a
static charge model, to fine tune the oxygen blow. A few dynamic control schemes are discussed
in the following sections.
9.6.4.1 Gas Monitoring Schemes
This scheme is based on a continuous carbon balance of the entire BOF system. A gas monitoring
system, which normally consists of a mass spectrometer, continuously analyzes dust free offgas
samples for CO and CO2 and determines the amount of carbon that has been oxidized at any given
stage of the blow. Given the amount of carbon present in the system at the beginning of the heat
(calculated from hot metal and scrap), one can calculate the level of carbon in the metal dynami-
cally during the oxygen blow.
Although this method has a sound theoretical basis,40 it has not been very successful at the com-
mercial level. One problem is that it is not possible to accurately determine the initial amount of
carbon present in the hot metal and scrap. Even a small amount of error in determining this initial
carbon content could result in  serious process control problems.39 Another problem is the diffi-
culty in continuous and accurate determination of the amount of CO and CO2 exiting the system
as offgas. Often the volume of filtering apparatus and tubing and the time to analyze a sample
causes a delay of more than 60 seconds before the result is displayed or available for control.
9.6.4.2 Optical and Laser Based Sensors
A few shops in North America have started using light sensors to dynamically estimate carbon lev-
els in the low carbon heats. The light meter system continuously measures the intensity of light
emitted from the mouth of the steelmaking vessel during the oxygen blow.43 The system then cor-
relates characteristics of the light intensity curve with the carbon content towards the end of the
oxygen blow when the estimated carbon is around 0.06%. This system has been been quite suc-
cessful in dynamically estimating carbon levels in low carbon heats (0.06% or less), and adjusting

517

the oxygen blow for improving the turndown carbon accuracy. However, this system cannot be used
for heats with aim carbon greater than 0.06%.
A few oxygen steelmaking shops have tried using laser based sensors to dynamically estimate the
bath temperature. Some laboratory researchers have attempted to devise a probe that would take
in-blow metal samples and provide instant chemical analysis. However most of these techniques
are still in the developmental stage and are not yet commercially available.
9.6.4.3 Sensor or Sub-Lances
Sensor or sub-lances are effective tools for controlling both the carbon and temperature of the
metal.41 In this technique a water-cooled lance containing expendable carbon and temperature sen-
sors is lowered into the bath about two or three minutes before the end of the oxygen blow. The
sensor determines the temperature of the metal bath at that time of blow and the carbon content of
the steel by the liquidus arrest temperature method. The carbon and temperature readings thus
taken are fed into the process computer which determines the additional amount of oxygen to be
blown and the amount of coolants to be added.
The sensor lance has proven to be an extremely effective process control tool, with an OK-to-tap
performance of 90% or more. The drawbacks of using sensor lances are substantial capital costs
and engineering and maintenance problems. There are many oxygen steelmaking shops in Japan,
and a few in North America, that are currently using the sensor lance technique to improve their
turndown performance.
9.6.4.4 Drop-in Thermocouples for Quick-Tap
Drop-in thermocouples or bomb thermocouples are effective tools for measuring the temperature
of the metal bath without turning down the steelmaking vessel. The thermocouple is contained in
a heavy cylindrical casing, which is dropped into an upright vessel from the top of the furnace.
The thermocouple probe has a sheathed wire attached to it which can convey a reliable emf read-
ing before it burns up. The generated emf is conducted  to a converter card and a computer, which
converts the analog emf signal to a temperature value. The temperatures recorded by drop-in ther-
mocouples have been found to be in good agreement with those measured using immersion
thermocouples.
Drop-in thermocouples can be used to quick-tap heats, i.e. tap heats without turning the furnace
down for chemical analysis. Certain grades of steel do not have stringent requirements for phos-
phorus or sulfur. In such a case, all that the steelmaking operator has to worry about at the end of
the blow is temperature and carbon. If the operator feels confident that the carbon level in the bath
is below the upper limit as specified by the grade (by either looking at the flame at the end of the
oxygen blow, or by reading light meter carbon estimates, or by any other means), then he can use
a drop-in thermocouple to determine the temperature of the metal bath without turning the vessel
down. If the temperature recorded by the drop-in thermocouple is close enough to the aim tem-
perature, then the heat can be quick-tapped. 
Quick-tapping is becoming increasingly popular in North America with the advent of better
devices for measuring in-blow carbon and bath temperatures. Quick-tapping has the obvious
advantage of saving the production time that is otherwise consumed in turndowns. However, there
is an obvious risk that a quick-tapped heat may be later found to have one or more of the elements
present above their specification limits, in which case the heat may have to be regraded or
scrapped. Another disadvantage is that the sensors cost between $0.05 to $0.10 per ton of steel.
9.6.4.5 Sonic Analysis
Several studies have been carried out in the past to correlate the audio emissions from the steel-
making furnace to the decarburization reaction and slag/foam formation. Investigators found an
increase in the sound intensity at the beginning of the blow due to the establishment of the decar-
burization reaction.42 The sound intensity reportedly decreased with the onset of slag and foam

formation in the slag. The sonic device can be used to control carbon and slag formation, which in
turn can be used to control dephosphorization. These units can be affected by extraneous noise.
Control is done by altering lance height or blow rate.
9.6.5 Lance Height Control
Lance height is defined as the vertical distance between the slag-metal interface in the furnace and
the tip of the oxygen lance. The consequences of poor lance height control were discussed earlier in
Section 9.2.2.6 on Oxygen Blow. It is an extremely important parameter as the height from which
oxygen is blown affects the overall fluid flow of metal and slag during the blow. It is important to
be able to measure it and to keep it consistent to achieve good process control of the furnace.
9.6.5.1 Measurement of Lance Height
Measurement of lance height was also discussed earlier. However, the best practice in measuring
lance height is to do it often. If the furnace bottom rapidly changes, due to either excess wear or to
rapid bottom buildup, the lance height should be measured frequently (once per shift). If the fur-
nace lining shape is stable, then less frequent determinations (once per day) will suffice. Lance
height has a significant effect on slag formation, furnace and lance skull formation and decarbur-
ization rate. Generally, the safest, reasonably accurate method is calculating the bath height from
refractory wear laser data.
9.7 Environmental Issues
9.7.1 Basic Concerns
Environmental or pollution control issues are becoming increasingly difficult and costly. State
jurisdictions are setting increasingly stringent standards for new site permits or for significant
modification to existing processes. Nearly every process has become a source of emissions.
Usually, these must be controlled to a legal standard which is measured in pounds or tons per unit
time. Sometimes, tradeoffs are permitted as long as a net major improvement or emissions reduc-
tion is achieved.
There are at least five major characteristic sources of environmental pollution. These include air-
borne emissions, water borne emissions, solid waste, shop work environment (usually burning and
welding) and safety, and noise. Air emissions are the major issues in a BOF shop. Water borne pol-
lutants, generated by the scrubber system, are clarified by settling and then the clean water is recir-
culated. Solid waste is generated by oxide bearing materials collected from the scrubber,
electrostatic precipitators or baghouse. While much solid matter is recycled, the rest is put into long
range storage for byproduct use (i.e., aggregate) and future recycle (for example, Waste Oxide
Briquettes). Noise generally is not a major concern in a BOF (i.e., compared to an arc furnace).
Shop environmental and safety is always a major concern for personnel protection and employee
morale. This discussion will concentrate principally on issues of air pollution.  
9.7.2 Sources of Air Pollution
There are two broad areas: undesirable gases such as CO, fluorides or zinc vapors; and particulates
such as oxide dusts. A brief summary of the various sources is discussed below.
9.7.2.1 Hot Metal Reladling
Pouring of hot metal from the torpedo car into the transfer ladle results in plumes of fine iron
oxides and carbon flakes. This mixture, called kish is the major source of dust and dirt inside the
shop. The graphite particles are generated because the liquid hot metal is saturated with carbon and
when the temperature drops during pouring into the ladle, the carbon precipitates out as tiny

519

graphite flakes. The usual method of control is to pour inside an enclosure (hood) and to collect
the fume in a baghouse.
9.7.2.2 Desulfurization and Skimming of Hot Metal
Pneumatic injection of the liquid iron with nitrogen and magnesium with a lance stirs the metal and
generates a fume similar to that of reladling. Often, the reladling hood is designed to accommo-
date the desulfurizing lance operation. During slag skimming, the splash of slag and metal is col-
lected in a vessel (usually a slag pot) which also generates fine oxide fume. This is frequently
collected in a separate hood over the skimming collection pot.
9.7.2.3 Charging the BOF
There is some fume generated when the scrap hits the bottom of the furnace. However, the major
emission is generated while pouring hot metal into the furnace. Here, very dense oxide clouds,
kish, and heavy flames rise quickly. Some shops have suction hoods on the charging side above the
furnace that collect fume and divert the heat away from the crane. However, many shops are not so
equipped and must rely on slow-pouring to limit the fume emission from the roof monitors to com-
ply with regulations. Pouring too fast results in heavy flame reactions that have been known to
anneal the crane cables, causing spillage accidents.
9.7.2.4 Blowing (Melting and Refining)
By far the largest mass of fume is generated during the main blow. Approximately 90% by weight
of total sources is generated at this point. The fume consists of hot gases at temperatures, over
1650°C (3000°F) and very heavy concentrations of iron oxide particles. The particulates can con-
tain heavy metal oxides such as chromium, zinc, lead, cadmium, copper and others, depending on
the scrap mix. The gas composition is approximately 80 to 95% CO and the rest is CO2. In open
combustion hoods, where air is induced just above the furnace into the cleaning system, the tem-
peratures can be as high as 1925°C (3500°F) because of further combustion of CO. The fume is
mostly fine iron oxides with some other oxides and dusts from flux additions. 
The collection systems for this fume are of two types. Open hoods draft enough air to completely
burn the CO before it hits the filtering device. Closed or suppressed combustion hoods either elim-
inate or reduce the induction of air to very low levels (<15%). This reduces the required fan horse-
power and filtering capacity. However, consistent sealing between the furnace and hood is required
to prevent the generating and igniting of explosive mixtures. Generally, the capital and operating
costs for closed systems are less than for open systems. Thus, the most recently built shops are
characterized by closed hood systems.
Another controlling characteristic is the filtering device. Two types have been successful in BOFs:
electrostatic precipitators and venturi scrubbers.  
The electrostatic precipitator draws the gas and fume into chambers. These are used only with open
combustion hoods. These contain many parallel plates or alternating plates and wires spaced
closely together within a few inches. Alternate elements (usually wires) are charged to a high
potential. As the fume nears or contacts the highly charged element it becomes charged and is
attracted to the other element (of opposite charge). Periodically the charge is dropped and the ele-
ments are vibrated, which releases the fume into a hopper and transport system below.
Precipitators require gas temperatures less than 370°C (700°F) and some moisture (>6%) to be
efficient.  A common problem is plate warpage, due to excessive heating, which results in electri-
cal short-circuits.
The venturi scrubber, used with either open or suppressed combustion hoods, induces the gas/fume
through a violent spray which washes and separates the fume from the gas. The oxide laden water
is then subjected to a series of separation processes, which are a combination of centrifugal, chem-
ical and settling operations. The settled filter cake is dredged and dried for recycling. Most facili-
ties now use venturi scrubbers.

9.7.2.5 Sampling and Testing
Turning the furnace down for testing and temperature sampling generates fine oxide fumes at a rel-
atively low rate. Most of this fume is drafted into the hood above. However, many shops running
on limited fan capacity close off suction in the hood on the testing furnace and start blowing the
next heat on the other furnace. The sampling/testing fume rates for a bottom-blown process are
much heavier than top-blown furnaces due to continued blowing through the tuyeres to keep them
clear. Most bottom-blown facilities use a charge-side enclosure, or doghouse, to effectively collect
these emissions into the main hood. In effect, the doghouse is a set of doors that extends the hood
down to the charging floor.
9.7.2.6 Tapping
Some fume comes directly from the furnace but most comes from steel colliding with the bottom
of the ladle or other liquid steel. The addition of alloys increases the smoke during tap. Some fume
is collected in the main hood, but much escapes through the roof monitors. Some shops use a tap
collection hood and route the fume to a baghouse.
9.7.2.7 Materials Handling
The handling of fluxes, alloys and treatment reagents can be a significant source of fume. Often the
handling facilities are equipped with a collection system that leads to a baghouse. Materials used in
small amounts per heat can be transported in bags or super sacks to eliminate fugitive dust during
transfer. Sometimes materials quality control specifications are required to control the generation of
dust during handling and transfers. Reducing burnt lime fines specification is an example. 
9.7.2.8 Teeming
Ingot teeming generally does not require special collection systems unless a hazardous element,
such as lead, is involved. Free machining bar stock and plates alloyed with lead are common exam-
ples. Here lead is added while teeming ingots. A mobile hood collects the lead laden fume while
teeming each ingot.  It is both a hazardous material for the workers (vapors and particulate) and a
solid waste. Further, workers’ lead contaminated protective clothing and equipment are collected
in special containers for proper disposal.
9.7.2.9 Maintenance and Skull Burning
The BOF operations generate skulls on equipment such as the furnace mouth, ladles, oxygen
lances, metallic spills etc. These must be processed or removed by oxy-propane burning or oxygen
lancing. Generally, this is a small emission source.
9.7.3 Relative Amounts of Fumes Generated
Most of the fume in the overall process is generated during the main blow. Table 9.11 summarizes
the relative amounts of fume generated from various BOF sources. Overall, about 31 lbs of fume
are generated per ton of steel. Over 90% is from the main oxygen blow and reblows.  The OBM
(Q-BOP) and other major bottom blowing processes generate somewhat lesser amounts of fume
with larger particle sizes which are easier to collect than the case of 100% top-blown.
Desulfurizing and tapping each generate about one pound per ton.
Table 9.11 also shows how much is removed by a reasonably good filtering system. A well
designed system will reduce the fugitive emissions in a shop to less than 0.2 lbs/ton, or by 99.4%
There is at least one consultant who has developed an effective modeling technique to test and opti-
mize emission collection designs. A test is done in a water tank using small jets of salt water as
pollution sources. The salt water is more dense than fresh water, and when put into a fresh water
tank and modeled upside down, it generates a plume startlingly like the real thing. This technique
has been very successful for both conformance to emission standards and for improving shop work

environment. Most jurisdictions look favorably on such modeling to check the viability of candi-
date collection system designs. 
9.7.4 Other Pollution Sources
9.7.4.1 BOF Slag
BOF slag is generated at a rate of approximately 240 pounds per ton of steel. Currently about half
of this quantity gets recycled within the plant to the sinter plant or is used directly in the blast fur-
nace. Such in-plant slag recycling has been declining because of higher steel quality demands, e.g.,
lower phosphorus. Other uses such a aggregate and agricultural purposes are being explored.
9.7.4.2 BOF Dust and Sludge
BOF dust and sludge is generated at a rate of approximately 36 pounds per ton of steel. Small
amounts are sold to other industries, such as the cement industry, while small amounts are recy-
cled to the sinter plant for metal recovery. There is a growing interest in using this material in the
BOF as an iron source and coolant, in the form of WOBs or waste oxide briquettes.
The major driving forces for recycling come from government mandated pressures to reuse
byproducts and not to land fill them. In many cases there is an economic opportunity to use a low
cost iron or coolant source. Problems to be overcome are buildup of phosphorus during recycling,
zinc content, moisture, and the use of safe and suitable binders to improve handling characteristics.
9.7.5 Summary
Studying emission sources is a way to understand the process from another point of view. It is of
increasing social and legal importance. Different jurisdictions do not always agree on acceptable
levels, but they are all headed toward tougher environmental standards in the future. Accordingly,
pollution control measures and evolving technologies will increasingly influence the design, capi-
tal, work environment, and operating costs of shops. Considerable thought by the steel industry is
now being given to controlling emissions through engineering.

Over the past 20 years the use of the electric arc furnace (EAF) for the production of steel has
grown considerably. There have been many reasons for this but primarily they all relate back to
product cost and advances in technology. The capital cost per ton of annual installed capacity gen-
erally runs in the range of $140–200/ton for an EAF based operation. For a similar blast furnace–
BOF based operation the cost is approximately $1000 per annual ton of installed capacity. As a
result EAF based operations have gradually moved into production areas that were traditionally
made through the integrated route. The first of these areas was long products—reinforcing bar and
merchant bar. This was followed by advances into heavy structural and plate products and most
recently into the flat products area with the advancement of thin slab casting. At the current time,
approximately 40% of the steel in North America is made via the EAF route. As the EAF produc-
ers attempt to further displace the integrated mills, several issues come into play such as residual
levels in the steel (essentially elements contained in the steel that are not removed during melting
or refining) and dissolved gases in the steel (nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen).
Both of these have a great effect on the quality of the steel and must be controlled carefully if EAF
steelmakers are to successfully enter into the production of higher quality steels.
There have been many advances in EAF technology that have allowed the EAF to compete more
successfully with the integrated mills. Most of these have dealt with increases in productivity lead-
ing to lower cost steel production. These are described in the detailed process sections.
10.1 Furnace Design
The design of electric arc furnaces has changed considerably in the past decade. Emphasis has
been placed on making furnaces larger, increasing power input rates to the furnace and increasing
the speed of furnace movements in order to minimize power-off time in furnace operations.
10.1.1 EAF Mechanical Design
Many of the advances made in EAF productivity over the last 20 years are related to increased
electrical power input and alternative forms of energy input (oxygen lancing, oxy-fuel burners) into
the furnace. These increased energy input rates have only been made possible through improve-
ments in the mechanical design of the EAF. In addition, improvements to components which allow
for faster furnace movement have reduced the amount of time which the furnace stands idle. Thus
the objective has been to maximize the furnace power-on time, resulting in maximum productivity.

10.1.1.1 Furnace Structural Support
In the 1960s and 1970s it was common to
install electric arc furnaces at grade level.
These furnaces would have pits dug out
at the front for tapping and at the back for
pouring slag off into slag pots. This con-
figuration lead to many interferences and
delays and is no longer recommended for
large scale commercial operations.
Modern furnace shops usually employ a
mezzanine furnace installation. Thus the
furnace sits on an upper level above the
shop floor. The furnace is supported on a
platform which can take on several dif-
ferent configurations. In the half plat-
form configuration, the electrode column
support and roof lifting gantry is hinged
to the tiltable platform during operation
and tapping. When charging the furnace,
the complete assembly is lifted and
swiveled. This design allows for the
shortest electrode arm configuration. In
the full platform design, the electrode
column support and roof lifting assembly
is completely supported on the platform.
These configurations are shown in Fig.
10.1.
10.1.1.2 General Furnace Features
The EAF is composed of several compo-
nents as shown in Fig. 10.2. These com-
ponents fall into the functional groups of
furnace structures for containment of the
scrap and molten steel, components
which allow for movement of the furnace and its main structural pieces, components that support
supply of electrical power to the EAF, and auxiliary process equipment which may reside on the
furnace or around its periphery.
The EAF is cylindrical in shape. The furnace bottom consists of a spherically shaped bottom dish.
The shell sitting on top of this is cylindrical and the furnace roof is a flattened sphere. Most mod-
ern furnaces are of the split shell variety. This means that the upper portion of the furnace shell
can be quickly decoupled and removed from the bottom. This greatly minimizes down time due to
changeout of the top shell. Once the top shell is removed, the furnace bottom can also be changed
out fairly quickly. Some shops now follow a practice where the shell is changed out on a regular
basis every few weeks during an eight hour downshift.
The furnace sidewall above the slag line usually consists of water-cooled panels. These panels are
hung on a water-cooled cage which supports them. The furnace roof also consists of water-cooled
panels. The center section of the roof which surrounds the electrode ports is called the roof delta
and is a cast section of refractory which may be water cooled. The furnace bottom consists of a
steel shell with several layers of refractory. This is discussed in more detail in Section 10.1.2. Fig.
10.3 shows a modern EBT EAF.

10.1.1.3 Water-Cooled Side Panels
One of the most important innovations in EAF design was water cooling, Fig. 10.4. Although this
was used to a limited extent in older furnace designs for cooling of the roof ring and door jambs,
modern EAFs are largely made up of water-cooled panels which are supported on a water-cooled
cage. This allows for individual replacement of panels with a minimum of downtime. By water
cooling the cage structure, it can be ensured that thermal expansion of the cage does not occur.
Thus warping of the cage due to thermal stresses is avoided as are the resulting large gaps between
the panels. Water-cooled panels allow very large heat inputs to the furnace without damaging the
furnace structure. In the older EAF designs, these high power input rates would have resulted in
increased refractory erosion rates and damage to the furnace shell.

Parameters which have a strong influence on panel life include water quantity and quality, water
flow rate and velocity, inlet water pressure and pressure drop across the panel, pipe/panel con-
struction material, and pipe diameter.
Water-cooled panels must withstand both high thermal loads as well as high mechanical loads. The
greatest mechanical load occurs during furnace charging. Scrap can strike the panels causing dent-
ing of pipes or even splitting and rupture. Thus the pipe selection must allow for a wall thickness
which can withstand these forces. At the same time, a minimum wall thickness is desired in order
to maximize heat transfer to the cooling water. This tradeoff must be evaluated in order to arrive at
an optimum pipe thickness. Generally, the minimum pipe thickness used is 8 mm. Maximum pipe
thickness will depend on the thermal load to be removed and the amount of thermal cycling. In
practical application the wall thickness is usually 8–10 mm.
In most applications, boiler tube grade A steel is used for water-cooled panels. These steel grades
are generally reasonably priced, are easy to work with and provide a suitable thermal conductivity
for heat transfer (approximately 50 Wm21K21) up to thermal loads of 7 million kJ m22hr21 (10,000
BTU ft22min21). However, this material is also susceptible to fatigue caused by thermal cycling.
In areas which are exposed to extremely high heat loads, copper panels might be used. Copper has
a thermal conductivity (383 Wm21K21) approximately seven times that of boiler tube enabling it
to handle very high thermal loads up to 21 million kJ m22hr21 (approximately 31,000 BTU
ft22min21). Copper panels will result in much greater heat transfer to the cooling water and thus
to optimize energy consumption in the EAF, copper panels should only be used in areas where
excessive heats loads are encountered (e.g. close to the bath level, oxy-fuel burner ports etc.). This
will of course be dependent on the amount of slag buildup over these panels. Generally, slag
buildup will be thicker on copper panels due to the greater heat transfer capacity. Alternatively, the
distance between the start of water-cooled panels and the sill level can be increased if steel panels
are to be used in the lower portion of the water-cooled shell. 
For most boiler tube grade water-cooled panels, a pipe diameter of 70–90 mm is usually selected.
For copper panels, the choice of tube diameter will usually be a cost based decision but frequently
falls into the same range. In some high temperature zones (e.g. lower slag zone), a smaller diame-
ter copper pipe is used with higher water velocity to prevent steam formation.
Cooling panel life is primarily dependent on the amount of thermal cycling that the panel is
exposed to. During flat bath conditions, the panels can be exposed to very high radiant heat fluxes.
Following charging, the panels are in contact with cold scrap. Thus the amount of thermal cycling
can be considerable. The optimum solution to this problem involves providing maximum cooling
while minimizing the heat flux directly to the panel. In practice it has been found that the best
method for achieving these two goals is to promote the buildup of a slag coating on the panel sur-
face exposed to the interior of the furnace. With a thermal conductivity of 0.12–0.13 Wm21K21,
slag is an excellent insulator. Cups or bolts are welded to the surface of the panels in order to pro-
mote adhesion of the slag to the panels.
It is important that the temperature difference across the pipe wall in the panels does not get too
high. If a large temperature differential occurs, mechanical stresses (both due to tension and com-
pression) will build up in the pipe wall. Most critically, it is important that the yield stress of the
pipe material not be exceeded. If the yield stress is exceeded, the pipe will deform and will not
return to its original shape when it cools. Repeated cycling of this type will lead to transverse
cracks on the pipe surface and failure of the panel.
Panel layout is related to several factors including thermal load, desired temperature rise for the
cooling water, desired pressure drop across the panel, and desired pipe diameter.
Generally, designers aim for a water velocity which will result in turbulent flow within the pipe.
Thus the minimum required water velocity will vary depending on the inside diameter of the pipe
which is used. A minimum flow velocity of approximately 1.2 m s21 is quoted by several ven-
dors.1,2,3 The maximum velocity will depend on the desired pressure drop but will usually be less

529

than 3 m s21. The range quoted by several vendors is 1.2–2.5 m s21. This will help to minimize
the possibility of steam formation in the pipe. Some systems are designed so that a water velocity
of at least 2.5 m s21 is provided to ensure that the steam bubbles are flushed from the panel. Failure
to remove smaller steam bubbles can result in a larger bubble forming. Steam generation could lead
to greatly reduced heat transfer (by a factor of ten) and as a result possible panel overheating and
failure in the area where the steam is trapped. In extremely high temperature regions such as the
lower slag line, water velocities in excess of 5 m s21 are used to ensure that steam bubbles do not
accumulate in the panel.
A vertical configuration is preferred in most modern designs because it minimizes scrap holdup
and also can help to minimize pressure drop across the panel. Generally water cooling systems on
EAFs are designed for an average water temperature rise (i.e. outlet 2 inlet) of 8–17°C with a max-
imum temperature rise of 28°C. Most furnace control systems have interlocks which will interrupt
power to the furnace if the cooling water temperature rise exceeds the maximum limit.
In high powered furnaces Fuchs Systems Inc. (FSI) recommends that a water flow rate of 
150 l min21 m22 (3.65 gpm ft22) for a side wall panel or 170 l min21m22 (4.14 gpm ft22) for a
roof panel should be available. For DC furnaces an additional 10 l min21m22 should be made
available.
Pressure drop across the panel is a parameter frequently ignored by most furnace operators. In
order to get uniform flow to each panel, it is imperative that the pressure drop across panels be as
even as possible. FSI recommends that the water pressure exiting the panels be at least 20 psi.
Frequently, panels of different design are mixed within the same supply system. This occurs
because replacement panels are frequently sourced from local fabricators as opposed to the origi-
nal furnace vendor. Slight changes in materials, dimensions and configuration can lead to big
changes in the panel pressure drop. Mismatched panels within the same supply circuit will lead to
some panels receiving insufficient flow and ultimately panel failure.
Most water-cooled panels are designed to be airtight. However, replacement panels are sometimes
made without complete welds between pipes. This may be a cost saving when considering the fab-
rication of the panel but will lead to increased operating costs and lost production. The EAF is
operated under negative pressure and as a result, air will be pulled into the furnace through any
openings. Thus openings should be minimized, especially those in and around the water-cooled
panels.
10.1.1.4 Spray-Cooled Equipment
Spray cooling has also shown itself to be a viable means for cooling EAF equipment. Spray-cooled
components are typically used for roof and sidewall cooling. The main components of a spray-
cooled system are the inner shell, spray nozzles and water supply system. Water is sprayed against
the hot surface (inner shell) of the cooling element. The outer shell acts purely for containment of
the water and steam. The inner shell is fabricated from rolled plate. A uniform spray pattern is
essential for proper heat removal from the hot face. Maintenance of a slag coating on the exposed
side of the hot face is also integral to regulating heat removal and protection of the cooling panel.
In general, at least half an inch of slag coating should be maintained.
The water supply system for spray-cooled panels is simpler than that used for conventional water-
cooled panels because the operation is carried out at atmospheric pressure. Strainers are provided
to ensure that suspended solid material is not carried through the circuit where nozzle clogging
could become a concern.
10.1.1.5 Furnace Bottom
The furnace bottom consists of a spherical plate section. This section is refractory lined and this
lining will generally consist of a safety lining with a rammed working lining on top. The plate
thickness is usually between 25 and 50 mm thick depending on the furnace diameter. Refractory
lining thickness is generally a function of operating practices and change out schedule. For AC fur-
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

nace operations, the typical refractory thick-
ness may range between 500 and 700 mm.
DC furnaces typically have thicker working
linings and the resulting refractory thickness
can range from 750–950 mm. Furnace
refractories are described in more detail in
Section 10.1.2. 
In some cases gas stirring elements are
installed in the bottom of the furnace. If this
is the case, special pocket blocks will be
installed during installation of the brick
safety lining. Alternatively, stirring elements
are lowered into place and refractory is
rammed around them.
The furnace bottom section will also contain
the tapping mechanism. Most modern fur-
naces employ bottom tapping. The reasons
for this are several, including slag free tap-
ping, decreased steel temperature losses dur-
ing tapping, hot heel practices, and
mechanical considerations.
Bottom tapping requires that the ladle be moved into position under the furnace on a ladle car or
using a ladle turret arm. This is beneficial as it frees up the crane for other duties.
For bottom tapping furnaces, the taphole is located in the upper section of the oval shell as shown
in Fig. 10.5. The taphole is filled with sand following tapping, prior to tilting the furnace upright
for charging. The sand is held in place with a slide gate or a flapper type valve which retracts in
the horizontal plane.
Many furnaces with tapping spouts are in operation in North America and in the case of pit fur-
nace operations, offer the only option. If a submerged siphon spout is used, slag free tapping can
be achieved though maintenance can be an issue. A leveled spout allows for tapping of steel and
slag together and is common in the stainless steel industry. Some furnace spouts have now been
retrofitted with slide gates on the spout so that quick shutoff of the tap stream can be achieved. This
also allows for slag free tapping. Fig. 10.6 shows several different spout configurations.
Typically, during furnace operation, the bath depth will not exceed 1 m in depth. Bath depth will
be a function of furnace diameter and typically ranges from 0.7–1.0 m. During bottom tapping, it
is important to maintain a minimum height of steel above the taphole to prevent vortexing which
will cause slag entrainment. The typical recommendation is that the height of liquid metal be 2.5
times the taphole diameter.

10.1.1.6 Furnace Movements
In the course of electric arc furnace operations it is necessary for several of the furnace compo-
nents to move. Typical requirements for movement include roof raise/rotation to allow for scrap
charging, electrode raise/lower and swing to allow for scrap charging, electrode raise/lower for arc
regulation, furnace tilt forwards for tapping, slag door up/down for deslagging operations, furnace
tilt backwards for slag removal, and electrode clamp/unclamp to adjust the working length of the
electrode.
Most furnace movements are made using a central hydraulic system which is usually sized for the
maximum flow requirement of the individual task requiring the greatest flow rate of hydraulic
fluid. Thus the size of the system can be kept to a minimum while still meeting the requirements
for furnace operations.
10.1.1.7 Furnace Tilting
The EAF is tilted for both tapping and slag removal. In the case of furnace tapping, the maximum
forward tilting angle will be dependent on the type of furnace bottom. For conventional spout tap-
ping, it may be necessary to tilt to an angle of 45° to fully tap the furnace. For bottom tapping fur-
naces the maximum tilt angle is usually 15–20°. An important requirement of slag free tapping is
that the furnace can be tilted back quickly as soon as slag begins to carry over into the ladle. The
typical maximum forward tilting speed is 1° per second. Most modern furnaces have a tilt back
speed of 3–4° per second. Any attempt to tilt back faster than this will place undue stress on the
furnace structure. Many furnace designs now arrange the center of the cradle radius so that the fur-
nace is balanced slightly back tilted towards the deslagging side. Many furnaces are also designed
so that if hydraulic power is lost, the furnace center of gravity will cause the furnace to tilt back up
into its resting position.
The furnace movement can be controlled by using either one or two double acting cylinders. The
furnace bottom sits on a cradle arm which has a curved segment with geared teeth. This segment
sits on a rail which also has geared teeth. As the tilt cylinder is extended, the furnace rocks forward
to tap the furnace.
For removing slag from the furnace, the furnace must be tilted backwards. The tilt cylinder is con-
tracted fully causing the furnace to tilt backwards. The slag pours off the top of the steel bath and
out through the slag door. The slag may be collected in pots or may be poured onto the ground
where it will be removed using a bulldozer. The typical tilt angle for deslagging is 15–20°.
One newer design of furnace bottom has the furnace cradle sitting on a bogie wheel. A cylinder is
mounted on an angle as shown in Fig. 10.7. In this configuration the taphole moves towards the
deslagging side of the furnace during tapping. The required tilting force is greatly reduced for this
configuration.
10.1.1.8 Furnace Roof 
The furnace roof can be dome shaped or as is more common with water-cooled roofs used in mod-
ern practice, the roof resembles a shallow cone section. The roof consists of a water-cooled roof
ring which forms the outer perimeter of the roof cage. This cage acts as part of the lifting structure
for the roof. Water-cooled panels insert into this cage which has a cylindrical opening at the cen-
ter. The refractory delta section is inserted to fill this opening. This delta section is designed to
allow the minimum opening around the electrodes without risk of arcing between the electrodes
and the water-cooled panels. The whole furnace roof is cantilevered off the roof lift column.
Typically, roof and electrode support can be swiveled together or independently. The electrode
stroke allows the electrodes to be  swiveled with the roof resting on the furnace shell which allows
for removal and replacement of the delta section without removing the roof. Typically, for a full
platform design, a swiveling support with pivot bearing, bogie wheel and gantry arm is employed.
For large furnaces, a roof lifting gantry is required. The swiveling can be achieved using either a

bogie wheel support or a thrust bearing. Twin shell furnace arrangements where the roof must pivot
between furnace shells sometimes employ a fork shaped gantry. Typically most modern furnaces
can raise and swing the roof in about 20–30 seconds. Roof swing speed is usually 4–5° per second.
This minimizes the amount of dead time during charging operations and increases furnace melting
availability. Typical roof configurations are shown in Fig. 10.8.
10.1.1.9 Electrode Arms and Lifting Column
Electrode control performance is limited by the lowest natural frequency in the positioning system.
It is therefore very important to ensure sufficient stiffness in the columns with respect to torsion
and bending. Several possible configurations for the guiding of the columns is shown in Fig. 10.9.
The choice of configuration is usually specific to a particular operation. However, the main objec-
tive is to avoid friction in the roller system while arranging the roller design to be compact yet
rigid. It is important to note that each arm must be capable of individual movement to allow for
electrode regulation. For lateral movement of the electrodes a common swing mechanism is used.
The conventional design uses a hydraulic cylinder to move the swing column. Some newer designs

now use a hydraulic motor inside the roller bearing. This cleans up the space around the cylinder
but makes the mechanism less accessible for maintenance.
Several options are available for electrode arms in modern EAF operations. In conventional EAF
design, the current is carried to the electrodes via bus tubes as shown in Fig. 10.10. These bus tubes
usually contribute approximately 35% of the total reactance of the secondary electrical system.4
Care must be taken to avoid induced current loops which can cause local overheating of the arm
components. Thus the electrode clamping mechanism requires several insulation details.
Current conducting arms combine the mechanical and electrical functions into one unit as shown
in Fig. 10.11. These arms carry the secondary current through the arm structure instead of through
bus tubes. This results in a reduction of the resistance and reactance in the secondary circuit which
allows an increase in power input rate without modification of the furnace transformer.
Productivity is also increased. Current conducting arms are constructed of copper clad steel or
from aluminium. Most new furnace installations now use current conducting arms.
Typical maximum electrode speed is approximately 30–35 cm per second when operating in auto-
matic arc regulation mode. When operating in manual raise/lower mode the maximum speed is
usually 15–20 cm per second.
10.1.1.10 EAF Secondary Electrical Circuit Components
The electric arc furnace secondary electrical circuit consists of several components including the
delta closure, power cables, bus tubes, electrode holder(s), and the electrode(s).
Power exits the furnace transformer via low voltage bushings which are connected to the delta clo-
sure. The delta closure usually consists of either a series of copper plates, copper tubes or in some
cases both. These are arranged so that the individual secondary windings of the transformer are
joined to form a closed circuit. Usually the delta closure is contained in the transformer vault and
protrudes through the vault wall to connect with the power cables. The delta closure is anchored
using insulated material to minimize distortion which may be caused by vibration and/or electro-
magnetic forces. A delta closure is shown in Fig. 10.12.
The power cables are the only flexible part of the secondary electrical system. These allow for rais-
ing, lowering and swinging of the electrodes. Furnaces usually operate with between two and four

cables per phase. The power cable generally consists
of multiple copper wire strands which are soldered to
copper terminals at either end of the cable. The copper
cable is covered with a rubber compound which is
secured at the terminals with nonmagnetic stainless
steel bands. Water cooling is critical to the life of the
cable. Usually, a dedicated closed loop cooling water
circuit supplies cooling to all of the critical electrical
components including the transformer, the delta, the
power cables, bus bars and electrode clamp. Cooling
water requirements range from 11–95 l min21
depending on the cable size.5
The power cables are attached to bus tubes which are
mounted on the electrode arm. Bus tubes consist of
rigid round copper pipe and provide the electrical con-
nection between the power cables and the electrode
holder. These bus tubes are also water cooled.
The electrode clamping mechanism provides the link
between the electrode arm and the electrode. It is very
important that the electrode be held firmly in place
during furnace operations. For current conducting
arms, it is not necessary to insulate the clamping
mechanism from the arm because the arm is part of
the electrical circuit. In the case of conventional elec-
trode arms with bus tubes, the arm does not form part
of the electrical circuit and must be electrically insu-
lated from the clamp. Thus the electrode clamp is bolted
onto the arm with a layer of insulation separating the

two. The clamp casing which has contact
shoes ensures that the electrode is making
electrical contact. The copper bus bars which
are supported on the arm are connected to
the contact shoe. Clamping systems can be
mounted external to the mast arm or can be
mounted inside the arm. Most are now
mounted inside the arm as this provides pro-
tection for the mechanism. A spring mecha-
nism ensures that the shoes contact the
electrode and a mobile yoke holds the elec-
trode in place. The spring assembly is retracted
using a hydraulic cylinder. This allows for
release of the electrode for slipping opera-
tions or to remove an electrode column.
The traditional electrode holder is annular or
horseshoe-shaped and consists of a single
piece copper construction. Some more recent
designs have incorporated copper contact
pads attached to a steel or nonmagnetic steel
body. Electrode heads and contact pads are
the most common failure point in the sec-
ondary power system. Electrode contact sur-
face failures are usually related to dirt
buildup between the contact face and the
electrode. Insufficient clamping pressure can
also contribute to failures. Contact pads/elec-
trode holders should be changed out and
cleaned during scheduled maintenance downtimes. Fig. 10.13 shows an electrode holder.
Water cooling is integral to service life for electrode holders. Several designs are common for elec-
trode holders, one of the most common having a cast-in pipe which allows circulation of the water.
Contact pads are usually castings or forgings with drilled holes to provide the cooling water channels.
Clamping force is a function of the electrode diameter. A general rule of thumb is that the clamping
force in Newtons equals 850 times the square of the electrode diameter, in inches. Typical values quoted
by vendors are 235 kN for 16 in. diameter electrodes and 460 kN for electrode diameters of 24 in.6
10.1.1.11 Electrode Spray Cooling
It has been recognized for some time that sidewall oxidation of the graphite electrodes is related to
heating of the electrode surface. Because the current flow is down through the electrode into the bath,
only the portion of the electrode below the electrode holder will heat up. Some early methods for
reducing the amount of heating of the electrode involved a water-cooled graphite segment located
at the clamping level. This method did reduce the amount of sidewall oxidation but required changing
out the whole column once the bottom graphite segment was consumed. Other methods for reduc-
ing sidewall consumption involved special coatings which would oxidize at a higher temperature.
The most practical solution has now been adopted by most high powered furnace operations. This
involves installation of a spray ring which is installed at the bottom of the electrode holder. The
concept is that water will run down the surface of the electrode and will evaporate once it enters
the furnace. Ideally, the water should be evaporated within the roof port where it will also provide
some protection to the delta refractory. The required flow rate will vary depending on furnace oper-
ating conditions but typical flow rate for a 24 inch electrode is 7–15 l min21 per electrode. Typical
savings in electrode consumption amount to 5–15%. This is however, highly dependent on the type
of furnace operation (i.e. DC, high impedance AC, etc.).

10.1.1.12 Shell Openings
Several openings are usually provided for furnace operations. The most obvious are the three elec-
trode ports which allow the electrodes to penetrate into the furnace through the roof. In addition, a
fourth hole is provided in the furnace roof to allow for extraction of the furnace fume. A fifth hole
may be provided for several reasons such as continuous DRI/HBI feed, coal injection or lime injec-
tion. These holes all occur high up in the furnace and as a result do not affect air infiltration into
the furnace as much as lower openings.
The lower openings in the furnace include the taphole which is filled with sand and the slag door.
The slag door was originally provided to allow decanting of the slag from the furnace. In most
modern operations, it is also used to provide access to the furnace for oxy-fuel burners and oxy-
gen lances. Several ports may also be provided around the circumference of the furnace shell for
burners. Occasionally, an opening may be provided high up on the furnace sidewall to allow a
water-cooled decarburization lance access to the furnace. Other openings may be provided low in
the furnace sidewall or actually in the furnace hearth to allow for injection of inert gases, oxygen,
lime or carbon.
10.1.1.13 Auxiliary Equipment
Auxiliary equipment is usually associated with injection of solids and gases into the furnace. Oxy-
fuel or air-fuel burners are used to provide additional heat to the cold spots within the furnace as
shown in Fig. 10.14. Typically, the cold spots occur between the electrodes and also in the nose of

the EBT furnace because it is further away from the electrodes. Burner efficiency is highest when
the scrap is cold and decreases as the scrap heats up. This is described in more detail in the sec-
tion on EAF operations. Burners are usually constructed of high alloy steel or stainless steel and
are water cooled. The burner tips are frequently constructed out of copper. Burners must be capa-
ble of withstanding high heat fluxes especially early in the meltdown cycle when it is likely that
the flame will flash back if its passage is obstructed with scrap. Most sidewall burners are sta-
tionary. Slag door burners tend to be retractable. The so-called banana lance supplied by Empco
actually follows the scrap down into the furnace as it melts as shown in Fig. 10.15. This unit can
operate in either oxy-fuel burner or oxygen lance mode. Burners are operated at different firing
rates depending on the furnace operating phase. A minimum low firing rate is maintained at all
times to ensure that the burner is not plugged by splashed slag.

Fig. 10.18 Water-cooled oxygen lance. (Courtesy of Fuchs.)
Oxygen lances come in many configurations but generally fall into two categories; consumable
pipe lances and non-consumable water-cooled lances. Many oxygen lances are now multi-port
lances and are also capable of injecting lime and carbon. Consumable oxygen lances are capable
of actually penetrating the slag/bath interface as shown in Fig. 10.16. The consumable pipe burns
back during operation and periodically, a new section of pipe must be inserted. A consumable
lance manipulator is shown in Fig. 10.17. Water-cooled lances do not actually penetrate the bath.
Instead they inject oxygen at an angle through the slag at high pressure so that the oxygen pene-
trates the bath. A water-cooled oxygen lance manipulator is shown in Fig. 10.18.
Another important auxiliary function is sampling the bath and obtaining a bath temperature. This
information is critical for the furnace operator so that adequate bulk additions can be made at tap.

Typically, bath temperature measurements are taken manually using a lance with a disposable card-
board thermocouple tip. The lance is connected to an electronic display which converts a voltage
signal into a temperature. Combined function units are also capable of measuring bath oxygen
levels. The bath sample is usually taken manually using a lollipop type sampler. The sample is
cooled and sent to the lab for chemical analysis. Some recent installations have automated bath
temperature measurement and sampling using an automated lance. This reduces the time which
operators have to spend out on the shop floor and also maintains a consistent sample location.
Many operations are now providing for carbon and lime injection at multiple points around the fur-
nace shell. It was recognized that with injection solely through the slag door, slag foaming tended
to be localized. By providing multiple injectors, it is possible to maintain more uniform slag foam-
ing across the entire bath. Several possible configurations are shown in Fig. 10.19.
10.1.1.14 Bottom Stirring 
For conventional AC EAF scrap melting there is little natural convection within the bath. As a
result high temperature and concentration gradients can exist within the bath. These can lead to
increased energy consumption, reduced reaction rates and over or under reaction of some portions
of the bath. Bath stirring can help to reduce these gradients and can be accomplished either elec-
tromagnetically or by using inert gas injection to stir the bath. Most modern operations opt for the
latter.
Typically, the elements used to introduce the gas into the bath can be tuyeres, porous plugs or com-
binations of porous plugs with permeable refractory rammed into place over top of the plug. Non-
contact elements (i.e. those which do not actually contact the bath directly) have the advantage that
they can be operated at higher turndown ratios without the fear of plugging. The choice of gas used
for stirring seems to be primarily argon or nitrogen though some trials with natural gas and with
carbon dioxide have also been attempted. Stirring elements are mounted within the refractory lin-
ing of the EAF. The number of elements used can vary greatly based on the design and gas flow
rate but is usually in the range of one to six. The size of the furnace and its design will also create
different demands for the number of stirring elements to be used.

10.1.1.15 Special DC Furnace Design Considerations
DC furnaces have probably been the biggest innovation in EAF technology in the past ten years.
The concept of operating an EAF on DC current is not new but only recently did the costs for rec-
tification units drop to the point where DC furnaces became economical. DC furnaces have sev-
eral unique requirements over AC furnaces in addition to the obvious differences in electrical
power supply which are discussed in the section on furnace electrics. A typical layout for a DC fur-
nace is given in Fig. 10.20. DC furnaces have only one electrode mast arm and a single graphite
electrode. This electrode acts as the cathode. Thus the top of the furnace is much less cluttered for
the DC case and in general has fewer components to maintain as compared to AC designs. The DC
furnace however, requires a return electrode, the anode, to complete the electrical circuit. This
anode is commonly referred to as the bottom electrode because it is located in the bottom of the
furnace shell. Several different designs
exist for the bottom return electrode
including metal pin return electrodes
with non-conductive refractories, billet
electrode, metal fin electrodes, and con-
ductive bottom refractory. These are
shown in Fig. 10.21.
In the case of current conducting refrac-
tory contact, the refractory lining at the
center of the furnace bottom acts as the
anode. The bottom has a circular flange
which rests inside a circular channel
which is welded to the furnace shell.
Inside the channel, the flange is sup-
ported by fiber reinforced ceramic
blocks. The space between the channel,
support blocks and flange is filled with
a refractory ramming compound. This
isolates the bottom electrically from the
rest of the furnace shell as shown in Fig.
10.22.
The spherical furnace bottom is con-
structed of high temperature steel. A
circular copper plate is bolted directly
to the furnace bottom. Four copper ter-
minals extend down through the fur-
nace bottom from the copper plate and
connect to flexible cables which in turn
are connected to the bus tubes. The con-
ductive refractory bricks are installed
over top of the copper plate. Heat flow
from the bottom of the furnace (usually
about 15 kWm22) is removed by forced
air cooling. Due to the large surface
area of the bottom electrode, the current
density tends to be quite low, typically
about 5 kAm22. However, it has been
necessary in some installations to use
nonconductive patching material in the
center of the furnace in order to force
the current to distribute more evenly

over the whole bottom. Failure to achieve proper distribution of the current resulted in hot spots in
the center of the furnace.
The billet return electrode configuration employs from one to four large steel billets (on the order
of 10–15 cm diameter but can be as large as 25 cm diameter) depending on the size of the furnace.
Usually, the design aims for a current of 40–45 kA per bottom electrode. The billets are in contact
with the bath at the top surface and will melt back. The degree to which the billet melts back is
controlled by water cooling. The billet is inserted into a copper housing through which cooling
water is circulated. By providing sufficient cooling, it can be ensured that the billet will not melt
back completely. Thermocouples monitor the bottom billet temperature and the cooling water tem-
perature. An insulating sheath isolates the copper housing from the billet. The billet is connected
to a copper base. The copper base provides the connection to a power cable. Fig. 10.23 shows the
Kvaerner-Clecim billet electrode.
The pin type of return electrode uses multiple metal pins of 2.5–5.0 cm in diameter to provide the
return path for the electrical flow. These pins are configured vertically and actually penetrate the
refractory. The pins extend down to the bottom of the furnace where they are fixed in position by
two metal plates. The bottom ends of the pins are anchored to the lower power conductor plate. The

bottom contact plate is air-cooled and is located in the center of the furnace bottom. The top por-
tion of the pins are flush with the working lining in the furnace. The pins are in direct contact with
the bath, and melt back as the working lining wears away. A return power cable is attached to the
bottom conductor plate.
An extensive temperature monitoring system is provided to track lining wear and bottom electrode
life. This enables scheduled change out of the bottom electrode. The integral cartridge design
which has evolved allows for quick change out of the bottom electrode over a scheduled eight hour
maintenance outage. The sequence of change-out steps is as follows:
1. Following the last heat prior to change-out, the slag is drained from the furnace and
refractory surfaces are sprayed with water to accelerate cooling.
2. Electrical connections to the bottom electrode are decoupled and thermocouples are
disconnected.
3. The integral cartridge is pushed up by six hydraulic cylinders which are located
around the perimeter of the bottom contact plate.
4. Once the cartridge is broken free of the furnace bottom, it can be removed by crane.
5. A new cartridge is then lowered into place and electrical connections are recoupled.
6. A small amount of scrap is charged and an arc is struck to test the system. Following
a successful test, the furnace is charged with scrap and melting is commenced at
reduced electrical current. Once a liquid heel is established, regular operation is
resumed.
A typical anode removal device is shown in Fig. 10.24. Fig. 10.25 shows a typical refractory lin-
ing for a UNARC furnace.
The steel fin return electrode uses steel fins arranged in a ring in the furnace bottom to form sev-
eral sectors. Each sector consists of a horizontal ground plate and several welded on steel fins

which protrude upwards through the refractory.
The fins are approximately 0.16 cm thick and
are about 9 cm apart. The sectors are bolted onto
an air-cooled bottom shell which is electrically
insulated from ground and is connected to four
copper conductors.
Most DC furnaces are operated with long arcs,
typically two to three times those encountered in
conventional UHP furnace operations. As a
result, many furnace manufacturers specify
higher water flow rates for water-cooled panels.
Some typical values proposed by Fuchs Systems
Inc. are 160 l min21 m22 (3.90 gpm ft22) for a
sidewall panel and 180 l min21 m22 (4.38 gpm
ft22) for a roof panel.
10.1.2 EAF Refractories
Refractories are materials which withstand high
temperature without a significant change in
chemical or physical properties. Refractory
materials are very important to EAF operation as
they allow for containment of the liquid steel in
the furnace hearth without damaging the furnace
structure. Refractories in general are discussed
in Chapters 3 and for EAF use are discussed in
Section 4.3.
10.1.2.1 Steelmaking Refractories
The electric furnace requires a variety of refractory products. Most important are the refractories
in direct contact with the steel. Today’s electric furnaces and EBTs generally use magnesite or mag-
nesite carbon products in the steel contact zones. Specialized refractories with good thermal shock
resistance are generally used in the roof/delta, the taphole, and the spout or runner of the furnace.
The following descriptions give general refractory recommendations.
10.1.2.1.1 Sub-bottom
Magnesite or tar-impregnated magnesite brick are generally used in the sub-
bottom due to good resistance to steel and slag in the event the working hearth is penetrated. These
refractories are expected to last six months, one year, or even several years if the bottom hearth
material is well maintained.
10.1.2.1.2 Hearth
Most electric furnace operators prefer a monolithic magnesite hearth which is
easy to install and maintain. Monolithic hearth materials are generally dry, vibratable high MgO
materials which develop strength by sintering in place during burn-in of the bottom. These hearth
materials generally have impurity oxides, like iron oxide, to facilitate sintering. Other operators
prefer all brick hearths, where the initial construction is totally brick, and monolithic materials are
only used to repair holes in the brick hearth after some period of operation. Modern EAF bottom
designs often include gas stirring elements which require porous refractory materials or tuyeres
through dense refractories to deliver the stirring gas to the molten steel. These stirring gases can
cause erosion of the hearth refractories and require regular maintenance.

10.1.2.1.3 Lower Sidewall
The lower sidewall generally uses the same brick quality as the sub-
hearth, high MgO, plain or tar-impregnated. These brick form the base for the slagline and upper
sidewall and are protected by the banks of the hearth material. They are replaced along with the
monolithic hearth.
10.1.2.1.4 Slagline
The slagline area of most furnaces uses magnesite carbon brick or tar impreg-
nated magnesite brick. Refractory selection in the slagline must be carefully coordinated with
expected slag chemistries. Carbon steel shops generate lime rich, FeO–SiO2 slags with a 2:11
lime:silica ratio, which demand basic refractories. In stainless operations, a more neutral fused
grain magnesite chrome brick may be utilized.
10.1.2.1.5 Sidewall/Hot Spots
Above the slagline, the refractory lining sees high temperature arc
flare, slag splashing, scrap impingement, and flame impingement from burners or lances.
Refractoriness, strength, and thermal shock resistance are the critical parameters for electric fur-
nace sidewall refractories. In furnaces with water-cooled panels, magnesite carbon brick is the
most common choice, with fused grain magnesite carbon brick in the hot spots.
10.1.2.1.6 Roof and Delta
If the roof is water-cooled, a precast delta of high alumina or alumina
chrome materials is a likely choice. Greater economy can sometimes be obtained by bricking the
electrode ports and ramming a high alumina plastic in the balance of the delta section. Roof deltas
are subjected to extreme thermal shock during roof swings for charging. Basic materials would
have better resistance to the furnace atmosphere, but cannot generally withstand the thermal
cycling. For complete refractory roofs, 70–80% alumina brick annular rings composing about two-
thirds of the roof are most common; with high alumina plastic or alumina chrome plastic rammed
in the delta section, again with high purity alumina or alumina chrome brick electrode rings.
10.1.2.1.7 Taphole
For conventional tapping electric furnaces, a taphole module or taphole block
with a predrilled hole is the most common construction. Other operators will ram high alumina or
basic ramming mixes around a steel pipe to form their taphole, while others will gun basic gun-
ning mixes around a steel pipe for the initial taphole. Some taphole designs will last the life of the
furnace campaign, while other operators regularly maintain their taphole by gunning around an
inserted metal pipe. For EBTs, dense magnesite or magnesite carbon shapes form the vertical tap-
hole. These are often encased within larger rectangular shapes to form a permanent taphole well in
the nose of the furnace. Again, some EBT tapholes last the life of the furnace while other opera-
tors patch the furnace with resin bonded patching mixes or perform regular maintenance by
installing new taphole shapes as needed. EBT tapholes require a well-fill sand between heats to
prevent steel freezing in the taphole; this sand is usually olivine, magnesite or chromite based.
10.1.2.1.8 Spout or Runner
The spout or runner of conventional electric furnaces may be brick
shapes, rammed plastic, or a large, preformed spout shape. Due to the extreme thermal shock on
this runner or spout, high alumina materials are preferred. Occasionally, a combined basic/high
alumina system will be utilized to maximize performance.
10.1.2.1.9 Refractory Considerations for DC Furnaces
DC electric furnaces have special refractory
requirements due to the fact that the return electrode is usually installed in the bottom of the fur-
nace (some DC furnaces use an alternative arrangement with two graphite electrodes).
In the case of a current conducting bottom, the refractory lining at the center of the furnace bot-
tom acts as the anode. A copper plate is usually connected below the conductive refractory and the
return copper bus bar is connected to the plate. In this case special requirements for the refractory
are low electrical resistance (preferably <0.5 milliOhms per meter), low thermal conductivity, and
high wear resistance.

A typical configuration uses a six inch thick working lining consisting of carbon bonded magne-
sia mixes containing 5–10 wt% carbon. These materials can be installed either hot or cold. Below
the working lining a three layer magnesia carbon brick is installed. The residual carbon content of
the bricks ranges from 10–14 wt%. With regular maintenance, this bottom electrode configuration
has achieved a bottom life of up to 4000 heats.
The billet return electrode configuration employs from one to four large steel billets (on the order
of 10 inches in diameter) depending on the size of the furnace. The billets are embedded in the bot-
tom refractory. The billets are surrounded with a basic refractory brick. The remainder of the hearth
is rammed with a special magnesia ramming mix. Magnesia ramming mix is used to maintain the
brick area around the electrode. This return electrode configuration has achieved in excess of 1500
heats on the furnace bottom.
The pin type of return electrode uses multiple metal pins of 25–50 cm in diameter to provide the
return path for the electrical flow. These pins actually penetrate the refractory down to the bottom
of the furnace where they are attached to a metal plate. Dry magnesia ramming mix is used for the
entire hearth lining. This mix is rammed between the metallic pins. Alternatively magnesia carbon
brick can be used in the area around the anode. This helps to improve the furnace bottom life but
is more costly. Typical bottom life ranges from 2000 to 4000 heats depending on the refractory
materials used.
The steel fin return electrode uses steel fins arranged in a ring in the furnace bottom to form sev-
eral sectors. Each sector consists of a horizontal ground plate and several welded steel fins which
protrude upwards through the refractory. Dry magnesia ramming mix is used between the fins. The
hearth is also lined with this material.
The important points to consider during installation are refractory zoning pattern, hearth contour,
slagline location, furnace steel capacity, taphole location, taphole size and angle, roof/delta orien-
tation, expansion allowances, burner port location, slag door construction, bottom stirring ele-
ments, and DC furnace bottom electrode.
10.1.2.2 Electric Furnace Lining Installation
Typical procedures for a complete new electric furnace or EBT lining follow.7
10.1.2.2.1 Sub-bottom and Monolithic Hearth
The furnace must be level and the shell cleaned from all
debris prior to starting. It helps to locate the exact center of the furnace and to punch a mark in the
bottom center of the shell. The preferred construction is rectangular magnesite brick laid on flat
using a basic granular material as fill to provide a flat surface against the rounded steel shell. After
locating the EBT taphole seating blocks, any bottom stirring elements and allowing for the DC fur-
nace bottom electrode, the first course of sub-hearth brick is laid dry, tight and LEVEL, and a dry
magnesite mortar is swept into the brick joints. Additional fill material is placed around the
perimeter of this first course and leveled out. The second course is laid at a 45° angle to the first
course and dry magnesite mortar again is swept into the joints. This process is repeated for three
or four flat courses. (There is an alternate, less preferable, sub-hearth design which lays two to four
flat courses which follow the curved contour of the steel shell. This may be used in furnaces where
the shell has a small spherical radius and gives more uniform thickness in the monolithic hearth
material.) At the proper elevation, key shaped brick are used to begin the first stadium course. It is
preferable to start with the largest ring one inch from the shell and work towards the center. To
close the ring, a key brick is cut on a brick saw to the exact dimensions required to close the ring.
If the cut shape will be less than a half brick, two cut shapes should be utilized. The void at the end
of the course up to the shell is filled with granular magnesite material. The next stadium ring is
installed in similar fashion. The contour of the stadium hearth shown on the drawing must be care-
fully followed to leave sufficient room to add the monolithic hearth material at the appropriate
thickness.

547

For EBT furnaces, it is even more critical to follow the refractory bottom drawing exactly. There
are partial rings of brick with varying radii extending out into the nose section of  the furnace
which must be kept level. One way to facilitate this is to drill a hole in the top flat course of bot-
tom brick in the exact center of the furnace and then utilize a broomstick with a nail on it extend-
ing up from this center brick as a mandrel to draw circles and arcs for the stadium rings and partial
rings extending into the nose.
10.1.2.2.2 All Brick Hearths
If a monolithic hearth material is not utilized, the final course or final
two courses in the all-brick hearth are laid in rowlock (on edge) or soldier (on end) construction.
Rowlock or soldier construction gives much greater brick-to-brick contact and minimizes heaving
of the hearth in service. Again, all courses in the hearth and stadium are laid dry and swept with
magnesite mortar to fill the joints.
10.1.2.2.3 Slagline and Sidewalls
Once the stadium rings are completed, the slagline brick are
installed course by course using the same keying up concept utilized for the stadium rings. The
slagline should also be installed in excess of one inch away from the steel shell to permit ther-
mal expansion without spalling or heaving the brick. Brick rings or partial rings should be con-
tinued up into the sidewall and hot spots until the water-cooled panels or the top of the furnace is
reached.
10.1.2.2.4 Door Jambs
The door jambs are a critical design area for the refractory lining. Several
operators simply utilize regular key shapes in interlocked courses as their door jamb, and they have
a successful practice. Other operators utilize special door jamb shapes which have greater surface
area for better interlocking between courses and a sharper angle which opens up the door opening
and eliminates or reduces refractory damage when slagging off. Still other door jam designs
involve brick or precast shape assemblies which are welded or bolted to the steel shell. These are
generally installed first and the slagline and sidewall brick laid directly against these assemblies,
with sidewall rings keyed up halfway between the door and the taphole.
10.1.2.2.5 Taphole
Conventional tilting electric furnaces generally use taphole module shapes set
with a crane at the proper elevation prior to bricking the slagline and sidewalls. One alternative is
to leave an opening in the sidewall rings and then ram or gun around a steel pipe forming the tap-
hole. This pipe is then melted out on the first heat. Refractory taphole shapes can also be utilized
in this same manner with monolithic material holding them in place at the proper elevation and
angle.
10.1.2.2.6 Roofs and Deltas
The electric furnace roof or the delta section in a water-cooled roof are
generally installed in a refractory reline area, and a finished roof is waiting for the furnace to be
rebuilt. With water-cooled roofs and precast deltas, a castable or plastic refractory is often placed
around the perimeter of the precast shape to lock it in place against the water-cooled roof. For brick
refractory roofs, a roof form is required (generally concrete) which creates the appropriate dome
shape for the inside contour of the roof. The mandrel(s) are set for the electrodes. Triple tapered
electric furnace roof shapes are laid in concentric rings against the roof ring for the outer two-thirds
of the roof. Often partial rings of brick are laid in a wedge pattern between electrodes. Electrode
ring brick surround each mandrel and are held in place with steel bands. A castable or plastic is
cast or rammed into place in the cavity between the outer rings and electrode ring brick.
10.1.2.2.7 Monolithic Hearth
Most electric furnace operators use a monolithic hearth material. This
is a high magnesite, self sintering product which is granular in nature. After installing any EBT tap-
hole seating blocks, bottom stirring elements, and DC bottom electrode forms; monolithic hearth
construction is started. The hearth material comes ready to use in large bulk bags; a crane holds
the bulk bag in position over the brick subhearth while the bag is split and the material is shoveled

into place. After two or three bulk bags are in the furnace, several workers using shovels or pitch
forks repeatedly jab the granular material in order to remove air and densify the refractory hearth.
As the material densifies, the workers further compact it with mechanical vibrators or by simply
walking on the hearth to achieve the proper contour. Additional bags of hearth material are added
and de-aired and densified until the final contour is reached (usually measured with chains or a
form). The new hearth sinters in place during the initial heat.
10.1.2.2.8 Heatup Schedule
On a new electric furnace lining with a completely new monolithic
hearth, steel plates or light scrap are generally lowered by magnet into the bottom of the furnace
to provide protection for the unsintered hearth material. After this cushioning scrap is in place the
first bucket is charged and the arc is struck, utilizing a long arc to avoid boring down into the new
monolithic bottom. The bottom is usually sintered after the first heat, although it is important to
inspect the bottom and banks for any holes or erosion due to unsintered material leaving a void in
the lining. Since the new electric furnace lining has very little moisture in it, no special precautions
are required during the initial heatup, other than using a long arc to avoid eroding the bottom prior
to sintering.
Electric furnace refractory linings are maintained by gunning, fettling, and patching with brick.
10.1.2.2.9 Gunning Maintenance
Gunning maintenance consists of mixing water with a magnesite
based gunning mix and spraying this mixture onto the refractory lining. Gunning is used to main-
tain hot spots, slagline erosion, tapholes, the door breast area, or any other portion of the lining
which experiences selective refractory wear. Gunning material is usually a temporary measure and
will have to be regunned in the same place within the next several heats. Gunning maintenance,
while temporary, does offer balanced life by evening out the highly selective wear pattern in the
electric furnace lining. That is, refractory wear in AC furnaces is usually greater in the sidewall
closest to the mast electrode; and gunning this area maximizes overall lining performance. Most
refractory gunned maintenance is done with a pressurized chamber batch gun of roughly 900–1800
kg capacity. This gun delivers dry material pneumatically to a water mixing nozzle, and the air
pressure sprays the wet gunning mix onto the surface of the lining. The nozzle operator’s training
and skill is a factor in the quality of the gunned patch, and there is a tendency to empty the gun,
which can increase refractory costs. Gunning can be automated by using a mechanical center-throw
gunning device which shoots gun material in a circular pattern while suspended from a crane. This
mechanical gunning is faster and easier on people, but often wastes material by placing it where it
may not be needed.
Basic gunning mixes range from 40–95% MgO in quality. High temperature operations and high
power furnaces generally use higher MgO content gun mixes; while moderate temperature opera-
tions utilize lower MgO content gun mixes. Carbon steel producers use between 1.4–7.5 kg of gun
mix per ton of steel. 
10.1.2.2.10 Fettling Maintenance
Fettling maintenance is the technique used to patch holes in the
monolithic bottom. A rapid sintering version of the granular hearth material, or the original prod-
uct, are used for fettling. The dry material is shoveled or dropped by crane wherever there is a hole
or divot in the monolithic bottom; or a mechanical chute suspended by crane delivers material onto
the sloped banks of the hearth. Occasionally the magnet is used to level this patch material, which
then sinters in place during the next heat. With this fettling technique, monolithic bottoms often
last anywhere from three months to one year or longer.
10.1.2.2.11 Brick Patching
After several weeks of operation, gunning maintenance becomes less
efficient in maintaining the refractory lining. Most operators will then take the furnace cold and
dig out anywhere from 30–80% of the sidewall and hot spots. The rubble is then removed from the
furnace and workers install new brick in all areas of the hot spots and sidewall which were
removed. Often the same refractory quality and thickness are reinstalled as was used in the initial

549

lining. Alternatively, lesser quality or thinner linings are installed during this patch and slightly less
lining life is anticipated from the patch as would be received from a new complete lining. The brick
patch is completed by gunning an MgO gunning mix into all the voids and cracks in the patched
brickwork.
Usually during a brick patch, the taphole is completely replaced or repaired with ramming mix or
gunning material, if not replaced with brick work. Most electric furnace operators will develop a
regular brick patch schedule for their electric furnace. This could be one or two intermediate
patches for every complete sidewall job. Or, some operators have utilized the continuous patching
concept where some brick are replaced every two weeks or even every week, and the complete lin-
ing is totally replaced only once or twice per year. These maintenance and patching decisions are
usually dictated by the severity of the operating conditions as well as the company’s economic
maintenance philosophy.
10.1.2.2.12 Miscellaneous Refractory Maintenance
Each EAF has unique features or conditions
requiring specific refractory maintenance. Roof delta sections must be replaced at failure or on a
regular schedule. Tapholes must be replaced or repaired when the tap time gets too short or slag
carryover starts.  Conventional EAF tapholes are usually replaced with a high MgO gunning mix
shot around a steel pipe, while EBT tapholes are knocked out and a new assembly or one-piece
tube inserted by crane from above. Bottom stirring elements and bottom electrodes each require
specialized maintenance procedures which vary with design.
10.1.2.3
Operating Philosophy
The operational philosophy often has a significant impact on refractory performance. If maximum
production is the key operating philosophy, decisions will be aimed at maximum production and
less than optimum refractory maintenance can result. Maximizing production usually requires a
high quality initial refractory lining that is expected to last a long time without much refractory
maintenance. There is a crossover point where a lack of maintenance actually reduces productiv-
ity, so the maximum production philosophy often requires a delicate balance on refractory lining
design and maintenance. The minimum cost philosophy is also common. Here the initial refractory
lining is inexpensive, generic brands which are anticipated to last a long time through patching or
gunned maintenance. Minimum cost linings generally have little zoning and often utilize the same
brand and lining thickness throughout the furnace. This philosophy can be effective for low inten-
sity operations.
10.1.2.3.1 Predictable Campaign
This philosophy generally requires a set period between refractory
relines or patches. In this scenario the electric furnace operator schedules full production for a two
week or three week period, knowing the furnace lining will make it that long. Then a patch or reline
is scheduled and another predictable campaign is begun. This philosophy requires close coordina-
tion and optimization of the refractory design with shop operations.
10.1.2.3.2 Minimum Downtime Philosophy
This scenario is similar to maximum production, but with-
out the same zeal for total production. Here the refractory lining must deliver predictable opera-
tions with very little maintenance, so a high quality initial lining is usually required. There is not
much time for downtime or maintenance until the scheduled down turn or down day. Predictable
maintenance is acceptable, but must be on a regularly scheduled basis.
10.1.2.4 Future Considerations
Electric furnace refractory requirements have changed significantly in the past several years and
are faced with even more change as electric melting technology and processes progress. The
increasing use of scrap substitutes, direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI) requires

modified furnace linings. Post-combustion of carbon monoxide and growing use of oxy-fuel burn-
ers both place demands on furnace refractory performance. Increased water cooling in areas of the
door jambs and burner openings will be required. There will be pressure to reduce refractory con-
sumption of chromium containing products and to ensure that refractories from all steelmaking
processes are recycled.
10.2 Furnace Electric System and Power Generation
10.2.1 Electrical Power Supply
An arc furnace requires a very high power. Each ton of steel melted requires on the order of 400
kWh (0.4 MWh), thus to melt 100 tons 40 MWh of electrical energy is required. For a meltshop
producing at a rate of one million tons per year it is necessary to produce at the rate of 100 tons
per hour or more. To reach this level, 40 MWh needs to be put into the furnace in about half an
hour of power-on time to achieve the desired productivity. This means that the average power level
in MW is on the order of 80 MW.
EAF meltshops typically require power levels in the 20–200 MW range, (enough for a small town).
Such large power levels can only be supplied by the utility from their high voltage network, where
voltages in the range 100–500 kV are present. This is a three-phase system (the three-phase choice,
rather than some other number of phases, was made early in the 20th century) and for this reason
the traditional AC furnace has three electrodes.
Inside the furnace the physics of electric arcs dictate arc voltages in the range 100–600 volts (AC
furnaces); above these levels the arcs become too long to be manageable. In order therefore to
obtain arc powers of the required MW it is necessary to operate with currents in the kiloampere
range; typically 20–80 kA (AC furnaces).
The power flows from the utility’s generators through their network and arrives at the steel plant at
very high voltage and must therefore be converted to low voltage suitable for arcs. This task is per-
formed by transformers.
10.2.1.1 Transformer System
For a variety of reasons the task of transforming the power from the kV level at the incoming util-
ity line to the voltage level needed by the arcs is usually done in two stages. A first transformer
(occasionally two transformers in parallel) steps the voltage down from the high voltage line to a
medium voltage level which is generally standardized for each country, Fig. 10.26. In the U.S. this
medium voltage is usually 34.5 kV, while in Europe, Japan and other areas the voltages are not very
different, often 30–33 kV. 
As the steel plant requires electrical power for other sectors, for example a caster or rolling mill,
there will be several transformers connected at the 34.5 kV level and thus it is common to have a
small 34.5 kV substation within the meltshop. This arrangement is one of the reasons for making
the transformation from utility to arc furnace in two steps.
From the 34.5 kV busbar the arc furnace is powered by a special, heavy duty furnace transformer.
The secondary voltage of this furnace transformer is designed to allow operation of the arcs in the
desired range of arc voltages and currents. However, because there are varying requirements of arc
voltage/current combinations through a heat—for boredown, melting and refining—it is necessary
to have a choice of secondary voltages. The furnace transformer is equipped with a tap changer for
this purpose.

10.2.1.2 Transformer Basics
The basic principle of operation of a transformer is illustrated in the sketch of Fig. 10.27. A pri-
mary winding is wrapped around one leg of a closed, silicon steel iron core. Around another leg
there is the secondary coil of a lower number of turns. The energy flows through the core trans-
ported by the magnetic field which is common to both windings. Because of the common field the
product of amps 3 turns is the same for each coil. Thus if there are, for example, 100 turns on the
primary coil and ten on the secondary the secondary current will be ten times the primary current.
At the same time the voltage induced in each coil is determined by the number of turns and the
magnetic field. Again the magnetic field is common so the voltage ratio of the primary coil to the
secondary coil is also determined by the ratio of primary turns to secondary turns.

Mathematically we have:
(10.2.1)
The arrangement of a three-phase transformer is sketched in Fig. 10.28. The closed iron core con-
sists of three vertical legs, one for each phase. Since it is not necessary to have primary and sec-
ondary windings on different legs they are usually wrapped over the same leg. Because the
secondary carries a high current it is practical to place it outside of the primary.
10.2.1.3 Core or Shell Designs
As sketched the windings are shown as cylinders enclosing the iron core—the core-type trans-
former design. An alternative used in some transformers is to wind the coils as spiral pancakes
which are arranged like a stack of disks over each leg. This design is known as a shell-type trans-
former and was chosen by some furnace manufacturers/steelmakers for its lower reactance (see
Section 10.2.4 for discussion of reactance). However in latter years the search for low reactance has
been replaced by the high reactance design so the use of shell-type transformers is diminishing.
10.2.1.4 Tap Changer
The purpose of a tap changer is to allow a choice of different combinations of volts and amps for
different stages of a heat. This is achieved by changing the number of turns of primary coil. (The
primary takes lower current so it is simpler to change the number of turns on this coil rather than
the high current secondary coil). Basically it takes the form of a motorized box of contacts which
switch the primary current to different parts of the coil around the iron core. A schematic diagram
of the connection to the primary coil is given in Fig. 10.29.
Most tap changers are designed to operate on-load. This means switching primary current, usually
in the 2 kA range, at 34.5 kV. A make-before-break contact movement is used to avoid current
interruption. Accordingly these contacts are subject to heavy erosion due to arcing and therefore
require preventative maintenance.
Some steelmakers choose an off-load tap changer in order to avoid the heavy duty of on-load
switching. However, such a tap changer requires that the steelmaker break the arc by lifting

electrodes and this procedure may take as long
as one minute. Today such a delay each time a
tap is changed is intolerable and as such this
design is becoming rare.
10.2.1.5 Transformer Generalities
The maximum magnetic field strength within
the core is determined by the properties of the
silicon steel laminations from which the core
is built. This field maximum therefore dictates
the size of the core which typically weighs
several tons. Several more tons are contributed
by the copper windings of which the sec-
ondary may be capable of 60 kA operation.
Cooling of these coils, heated by Ohmic
losses, is achieved by forced oil circulation,
the oil itself being cooled by water in a heat
exchanger usually outside the transformer
tank. Together with its oil, a typical furnace
transformer may weigh in the 50–100 ton range.
Transformers are rated in terms of MVA which is a measure of the Ohmic heating of the coils and
therefore the temperatures reached by the windings. Persistent overloading of the transformer by
the steelmaker will lead to higher than design coil temperatures and a corresponding decrease in
lifetime of the insulating material separating coils from each other and the core.
The duty of a furnace transformer is arduous. Arcs are unsteady loads and are often short-circuited
and sometimes open-circuited by scrap movements, leading to large current fluctuations. The sec-
ondary coils are subject to severe magnetic force shocks which must be absorbed by the insulated
clamping system holding the coils in place. Any loosening of these clamps could result in failure
of the insulation.
The primary coil sees a variety of voltage spikes due to switching the transformer on or off, which
may happen up to 100 times per day. Although the coils are rated at approximately 34.5 kV,
between them high frequency voltage surges can reach several times this level.
Because of the critical role of the furnace transformer
in steel production there are a variety of alarms and
indicators intended to allow monitoring and preven-
tative maintenance. 
Tap changers tend to be attached outside of the trans-
former tank to allow for easy access for contact main-
tenance.
10.2.2 Furnace Secondary System
The secondary coil terminations from the furnace
transformer exit the tank as a set of copper busbars.
To step up to the high currents required in the furnace
these exit busbars are then connected into a delta clo-
sure usually affected outside the transformer, see Fig.
10.30. (Some suppliers have put this delta closure
inside the tank to improve cooling.)
As there is always a slight risk that the transformer
oil may be involved with a fire hazard it is standard

practice to place the transformer and some other ancillary equipment in its own building, the trans-
former house, which simplifies fire control measures associated with the transformer. Thus the
high current busbars powering the furnace pass through a wall of this house and it is at this junc-
tion where the flexible cables are connected.
10.2.2.1 Cables
Cables are necessary to allow the electrodes to follow the scrap level lowering during meltdown
and to allow for furnace movements such as roof swing and tapping. Usually several cables are
required on each phase to handle the current.
10.2.2.2 Furnace Arms and Busbars
The mobile ends of the cables are attached to the horizontal arm/busbar system. More and more
the manufacturers of furnaces pass the current through an electrically conductive arm to the elec-
trodes rather than through separate busbars. Such conductive arms are either copper clad, steel box
constructions or aluminum alloy fabrications. In both cases the whole arm runs at voltage and must
therefore be insulated from its supports. In the older separate busbar arrangement both the busbars
and the arms were individually isolated electrically from one another.
Current passes to the electrode via the holder. The most common design here is to have one or two
fixed contact surfaces, which also act to align the electrode, and a separate pressure pad. The lat-
ter is pressed against the electrode in fail-safe fashion with a spring. This spring is compressed
hydraulically to open the holder.
10.2.3 Regulation
10.2.3.1 Hydraulic Components
The electrode/arm/mast/cable assembly weighs typically in the range of 20 tons. This is moved ver-
tically for control purposes by a hydraulic cylinder incorporated in the mast. (In some furnaces the
movement is effected by an electric motor/cable winch arrangement). As the arc length is depen-
dent, amongst other things, on the level of scrap or liquid under the electrode, and this level
changes through the heat, it is necessary to have an automatic control over electrode position—the
regulation system.
The flow of the inflammable fluid to the mast cylinder is under the control of a hydraulic spool
valve. Flow control is achieved by covering and uncovering ports by displacement of the spool over
a stroke in the range of 10 mm. It is pushed by an hydraulic amplifier, a device which generates
the necessary power from a separate valve operating with lubricating oil under pressure. An elec-
trical signal enters this amplifying valve at the level of milliamps or a few volts. Thus the system
consists of a low power electrical signal, amplified by a hydraulic valve causing displacement of
the main spool valve. Fig. 10.31 shows a section of a typical combined amplifier/spool valve.
10.2.3.2 Electronic Control of the Hydraulic Valve
Modern valves incorporate electronic control of several parameters. The most basic parameter is
the proportionality between signal level and electrode speed—the gain. Spool valves usually
exhibit a dead band over which a signal change produces no flow and to some extent this can be
compensated in the electronic system. It is also common practice to control maximum speed elec-
tronically rather than through separate flow impedances in the hydraulic lines.
Further signals which can be used by the electronic part of the regulation can be provided from
hydraulic pressure and flow rate, allowing speed feedback to be employed.
10.2.3.3 Electrical Control Philosophies
There are significant variations in the way the furnace electrical signals are manipulated in order
to achieve the control of arc furnaces. These variations reflect the different philosophies and opinions
Electric Furnace Steelmaking

555

amongst suppliers and steelmakers on how best to achieve control. It is the regulation system which
influences many important aspects of furnace performance, such as MW input, mean current, arc
stability, scrap melting pattern, energy losses to water-cooled panels, energy, and electrode and
refractory consumptions. As all these parameters are interrelated in a complex and not well under-
stood manner, it is not surprising that there are many differences of opinion on optimum control
strategies.
There is a limit to the acceleration to which the cantilevered mast/arm/electrode can be moved; too
high can lead to excessive forces on the system. If, however, the acceleration is too low the time
taken to move the electrode becomes excessive. As a general rule the response time (time to reach
90% of full speed) falls between 0.2 and 0.5 seconds. In contrast, arc voltage and current changes
are very fast; times are less than one cycle
(1/60 or 1/50th second). Because of this
inherent mechanical limitation it is not
possible to move the system fast enough to
correct the fast arc changes; only the lower
speed electrical variations can be con-
trolled by the electrode regulation system.
The accepted standard handling of the elec-
trical signals is to form an impedance con-
trol. A voltage signal taken from the phase
to ground and a current signal are each sep-
arately rectified and their DC values are
compared back-to-back, as shown in Fig.
10.32. If the voltage and current are each at
a desired level—the set point chosen by the

steelmaker—the output from this comparison of signals is arranged to be zero. If however the cur-
rent exceeds this level its signal increases and simultaneously the voltage decreases. Then the two
back-to-back voltages do not balance and an output voltage is generated. This signal goes to the
regulating valve in such a way to command the electrode to raise, aiming to reduce current. This
method of control attempts to hold the ratio of voltage to current constant, hence its description as
impedance control.
Alternatives to control of impedance are control over current, arc resistance, arc power or arc volt-
age. In each case the system attempts to keep the relevant parameter constant. In the cases of arc
resistance, arc power and arc voltage controls it is necessary for the supplier to obtain an arc volt-
age signal. This is not straightforward but the techniques for doing so have been known for some
time.8 The extraction of an arc voltage signal requires that inductive voltages proportional to the
rate of change of current be subtracted from the easily accessible secondary phase-to-ground volt-
ages. Rogowski coils are used for this purpose. Indeed such coils, with integration of the output,
are commonly used for current measurement.
During the course of a heat the electrical characteristics of the furnace vary. As a consequence the
mean electrical parameters will drift with time through the heat if the set points are constant. And
the different control philosophies—impedance, current, resistance, etc.—drift through the heat in
different ways. Another strategy open to the steelmaker therefore is to vary the set points through
the heat in such a way as to achieve real-time optimization.
10.2.4 Electrical Considerations for AC Furnaces
10.2.4.1 Importance of Reactance
In high current systems like arc furnaces reactance plays an important role in the electrical char-
acteristics.
Fig. 10.33 illustrates a high current loop consisting of two bus tubes 15 m (50 ft) long, separated
by about 1 m (3 ft). These dimensions are chosen to represent two phases of a three-phase furnace
secondary from transformer to arc. If the current is DC the voltage necessary to drive a current of,
say, 60 kA around the loop is merely that required to overcome Ohmic resistance. For typical fur-
nace busbars this voltage would only be
about 2.5 volts. But if we wish to vary the
current we must also overcome the induced
voltage generated by the change in mag-
netic field linking the loop. High currents
mean high fields so the induced voltage
is also high and is always opposed to the
source of current variation. In this exam-
ple if we wish to drive 60 kA AC current
around this loop we would need a much
higher voltage—about 300 volts! This
inductive impedance to alternating cur-
rent flow is called reactance.
For a sinusoidal current waveform the
voltage waveform is also sinusoidal but
one quarter cycle ahead in time (90 elec-
trical degrees), as shown in Fig. 10.33.
This means that the voltage maximum
occurs as the current passes through zero.
This feature of high voltage around cur-
rent zero is critical to arc stability when
an arc is present.

10.2.4.2 Arc Characteristics
The power flow from the utility’s generator, through the net and set of transformers, through cables,
arms and electrodes finally reaches the arcs where the useful work of melting and heating occurs.
Approximately 95% of the power taken from the utility is released in the arc so its characteristics
dominate the functioning of the whole system.
As an electrical element the arc is complicated; it is not a simple fixed Ohmic resistor. Current is
transported by free electrons and positive ions in a high temperature plasma in which temperatures
may be of the order of 10,000–15,000°C in the hottest regions, dropping to local ambient of, say,
2000°C at the boundary. The diameter of this conducting column depends on current and is of the
order of 10–20 cm (4–8 in.), much less than that of the graphite electrode. The voltage depends
principally on the length of the column and is of the order of 10 V/cm (25 V/in.); a 300 V arc may
therefore typically be 30 cm (12 in.) long.
Because of its high temperature, density is low and for this reason the arc is very easily displaced
at high speed by magnetic fields, especially local fields produced by the current flow in pieces of
scrap. These effects can result in arc movement over the end of the graphite electrode in millisec-
onds (ms). In doing so the length of the arc generally changes for geometrical reasons and this in
turn results in rapid voltage variations.
Another consequence of the low mass of an arc is that its thermal capacity is also very low. If the
current is switched off the ionized plasma column disappears with a characteristic time of about
one millisecond. Thus when the current is alternating, as in an AC furnace, the arc has a tendency
to cool off each time the current drops to zero. Re-establishment of current flow in the reverse
direction may take several hundred volts, depending on ambient conditions, mainly how hot are the
graphite and steel arc terminations. This re-establishment of the arc as the current passes through
zero is assisted greatly by the presence of reactance in the circuit. The more reactance present the
greater is the available voltage at current zero and the smoother is the current polarity transition.
Fig. 10.34 shows arc voltage waveforms under various conditions during a heat. At the beginning
when the arc is running between the comparatively cool graphite electrode and cold pieces of
scrap, instability of arc voltage is at a maximum. During the course of melting the arc voltage
waveform becomes smoother as temperatures rise. A further improvement occurs when the steel
termination of the arc is liquid. At the extreme, when the arcs are submerged in foaming slag, the
voltage waveforms are almost sinusoidal.
This large excursion in the stability and har-
monic content of the arc voltage is reflected in
the electrical characteristics of an arc furnace.
In the early periods of a heat, effective MW
input is lower for a given regulated set point
than at later periods. Fig. 10.35 shows gener-
alized electrical characteristics both as MW
versus kA and as MW versus MVAR. As sta-
bility improves all the curves move to a higher
level of MW, tending towards the limit case
where the arc voltages would be perfectly
sinusoidal and steady. In this hypothetical case
of perfectly Ohmic arcs the MW–MVAR
characteristic becomes the familiar semicir-
cle, the magnitude of which depends on the
transformer voltage and the circuit reactance.
Mathematically the effect of real arcs is sim-
ilar to introducing more reactance into the
circuit than physically  exists. One can model
empirically the changing characteristics by

considering the total circuit to have an operating reactance which is higher than the actual and
which decreases with time through the heat.
10.2.4.3 Supplementary Reactance; the High Reactance AC Furnace
The geometrical constraints of the layout of arc furnaces in the 80–160 ton range result in systems
which tend to have the total reactance—transformer plus secondary system—falling in a limited
range of 2.5–4 milliOhms (per phase). In order to operate with arc voltages in the 400–500 V range
this natural reactance level is too low to guarantee smooth transition through current zero during
scrap melting. It is now therefore common practice to add supplementary reactance to the circuit.
This is achieved conveniently by adding a reactor on the line supplying the primary of the furnace
transformer where currents are lower.
Such reactors come in two varieties; one is the air-cored coil design, generally placed outdoors of
the meltshop. This design is simple and inexpensive. The alternative is to use an iron-cored reac-
tor, in which the magnetic field is restrained to the restricted volume of the core. Consequently this
design takes up less space and is suitable for installation next to the furnace transformer, or, in
some cases, within the transformer tank.
The usual magnitude of the additional reactance is such as to push the total reactance per phase
into the 5–10 mOhm range (as viewed from the secondary voltage of the transformer). Since the
total system impedance is higher in this design of furnace it is necessary to have a corresponding
higher transformer voltage to obtain the desired characteristics.
The effect of operating with higher reactance and higher secondary voltage is illustrated in Fig.
10.36. With the increased reactance the secondary voltage waveform is much higher during the

passage through current zero. As a consequence the risk of current interruption is greatly reduced;
current waveforms are smoother and MW are therefore increased.
10.2.5 Electrical Considerations for DC Furnaces
10.2.5.1 DC Supply
The required high power again is supplied from a high voltage three-phase AC network. This is
converted to DC by rectification of the output of the furnace transformer.
Rectification is achieved by bridge-connected thyristors. A single, three-phase bridge connection
is illustrated in Fig. 10.37. The voltage waveforms for different thyristors firing angles are shown
in Fig. 10.38 (simplified). This output is described as six-pulse. Normally 12, 18 or 24-pulse sup-
plies are used in arc furnaces, obtained by multiple, parallel transformers electrically displaced one
from another so that their individual pulses overlap uniformly. This electrical displacement, of 15,
10 or 7.5°, corresponding to the 12, 18 or 24-pulse systems, is made by various coil connections
within the transformer. For this reason the transformers used for DC furnaces are quite different to
those for AC and are generally unsuitable for AC furnace operation.
The volt/amp characteristic of a DC supply consists of a weakly declining drop of DC voltage as
the DC current increases. The slope of this line is on the order of 1 volt per kA and is determined
by the commutating reactance of the transformer/rectifier combination, not by the arc furnace. In
order therefore to limit wide current excursions due to widely different arc voltages thyristors are
used in preference to diodes. The conducting instant after current zero (firing angle delay) is under
the control of the gate terminal. Each thyristor can, in principle, be turned off within half a cycle.
Even so, within the several millisecond delay between an arc voltage change (e.g. a short circuit)
and the control of the thyristors, currents could increase significantly. To reduce the rate of rise of
the current it is normal to add a reactor within the DC current loop, the natural reactance of the
high current DC loop being inadequate.
These reactors are sized to have an inductance in the 100–400 microH range. Since they take the
full DC current, Ohmic losses are significant and can only be maintained within acceptable bounds
by employing an adequate section of the copper or aluminum making up the coils.
Thyristors are each capable of handling a few kA and a few kV of reverse polarity. An arrangement
of series and parallel connected thyristors makes up each leg. Fuses and voltage balancing resis-
tors are used as protective measures. Cooling is affected by de-ionized water.
10.2.5.2 Electrical Characteristics of DC Furnaces
The thyristor control is normally chosen to hold current constant. Thus the AC current before the
rectifier is also constant, as is the primary current. Considering powers on the AC primary we see
that constant current means MVA is constant. The characteristic of MW as a function of MVAR is
therefore a quadrant of a circle for which
MW2 1 MVAR2 5 MVA2 5 constant
(10.2.2)
The corresponding DC voltage/DC current
relationship is illustrated in Fig. 10.39
where an example of a 1000 V maximum is
shown. Generally the slope of the volt/amp
line is linear and drops typically 100 V in
100 kA.
Thus at 100 kA, for example, the thyristor
control can hold constant current over an arc
voltage range from about 900 V down to short
circuit by varying the firing angle.

10.2.5.3 Bottom Connections
In order to operate with a single DC arc it is necessary to make an electrical connection—the pos-
itive anode—to the steel charge. Various furnace manufacturers have developed several solutions
to this problem. The ideas are illustrated in Fig. 10.40.
In one type the anode current is shared amongst many steel rods embedded in a rammed refractory
block. The rods, with a diameter of about one inch, could be one meter long and are linked by a
copper plate below the furnace shell. The whole anode block may measure 1–2 m in diameter.
A variation on the pin type is to use thin steel sheets, again embedded in refractory.
Another variation is to employ a steel billet of diameter 400 mm (8 in.) passing through an insu-
lated sleeve, leading to a cooled copper connection below the furnace shell.
In all three of these designs (pin, sheet or billet) the top of the steel conductor melts through the
course of the heat. It resolidifies during power-off and after scrap charging.

An alternative to the steel-to-steel current designs is one where the current is taken through con-
ductive refractories to a large diameter, copper bottom plate.
In all bottom connection types there must be insulation between the anode connection and the fur-
nace shell. This is to reduce the likelihood of current passing through the shell directly to the anode
busbars.
10.3 Graphite Electrodes
Graphite electrodes play an important part in electric arc furnace operation, allowing for the trans-
fer of electrical energy from the power supply to the furnace bath. Electrodes must be capable of
withstanding large temperature swings during furnace operation while at the same time providing
for continuous and uniform power supply to the process.
As electric furnaces have evolved over the past 20 years, advances in graphite electrode technol-
ogy have played an important part. As furnace designs were improved to allow higher power input
rates, graphite electrode properties were improved to allow greater supply of electrical power to the
furnace. Thus as EAF designs and operating practices have evolved, graphite electrode technology
has kept pace, allowing for continued advances in EAF steelmaking capability. It is now common
for new arc furnace installations to have transformers rated at in excess of 100 MVA. DC furnace
operations have also placed additional requirements on electrode characteristics.
10.3.1 Electrode Manufacture
Graphite electrodes are typically made using premium petroleum needle coke, coal tar pitch, and
selected proprietary additives. Electrodes are formed in the shape of cylindrical sections that are
fit together using screw-in connecting pin sections. Electrodes are available in a variety of diame-
ters, the requirements being dependent on the required current carrying capacity. Typically, diam-
eters greater than 24 inches carry a premium price due to the requirement for different process

technologies. Higher quality raw materials, increased energy amounts, extended processing sched-
ules, and the installation of larger, heavy duty equipment are necessary to produce these electrodes.
Processing and manufacture of graphite electrodes consists of the following steps as shown in
Fig.10.41:
1. Milling and mixing of petroleum needle coke with coal tar pitch and selected addi-
tives.
2. The mixture is then extruded and cut to cylindrical, green electrode sections.
3. The green electrodes are placed in saggers (stainless steel cans) in which the elec-
trodes are covered with a protective packing medium like sand. The filled saggers
are loaded onto railcar flatbeds which are moved into large gas fired car bottom
kilns where the green electrodes are baked to approximately  800°C. The bituminous,
green electrode material is transformed into amorphous, brittle carbon which is
abrasive and difficult to machine. This process requires careful control to ensure

that thermal gradients remain small and rapid gas buildup does not occur.
Thermally induced stresses or rapid gas buildup can result in cracking, distortion,
or excessive porosity which can not be tolerated in the finished product. For this
reason, bake cycles are long and take between three to four weeks.
4. The baked carbon sections are impregnated with petroleum pitch in order to
increase strength and density. This also improves the end product electrical con-
ductivity.
5. The impregnated carbon sections are again loaded into car bottom kilns and re-
baked so that the petroleum pitch is converted to carbon.
6. The re-baked carbon sections are assembled to columns of eight to ten electrodes
and loaded into large, electrically powered graphitizing furnaces. Direct current of
more than 100kA is passed through the electrode columns heating them to approx-
imately 3000°C. The intense heating causes the crystalline structure to change from
the random amorphous form to the ordered layer structure of graphite. This modi-
fication increases machinability of the material as well as greatly improving elec-
trical, thermal and mechanical properties. The graphitizing process is very energy
intensive and requires more than 3000 kWhr per ton of graphite.
7. Finally, the graphitized sections are machined to the required diameter and length
on large lathes. Tapered sockets are machined into each end to accommodate screw-
in connecting pins which are used to attach the electrode sections end-to-end. The
total production process from extrusion to shipping is quite time consuming and
takes approximately three months. 
10.3.2 Electrode Properties
Electrode physical properties vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer. However, for
most ultra high power (UHP) furnace operations these properties will be similar regardless of man-
ufacturer. Following in Table 10.1 are typical electrode physical properties:

10.3.3 Electrode Wear Mechanisms
Considerable research has been carried out over the years to evaluate the factors affecting
electrode consumption. Generally speaking, electrode consumption occurs as both continu-

ous consumption and discontinuous consumption. Continuous consumption usually accounts for
90% or greater of the total consumption and results from tip consumption (sublimation) and side-
wall oxidation. Discontinuous consumption mechanisms include electrode breakage, butt losses,
and electrode tip spalling.
Prior to implementation of electrode water spray cooling, the two continuous consumption mech-
anisms were believed to be approximately equal. Water spray cooling results in reduced electrode
sidewall temperatures above the furnace roof which helps to reduce the amount of sidewall oxida-
tion. Thus a shift to 50% of consumption due to tip consumption and 40% due to sidewall oxida-
tion has been observed in operations using electrode spray cooling.
10.3.3.1 Original Bowman Correlations
Correlations have been developed empirically to estimate electrode consumption for various oper-
ating practices. It was found that electrode tip consumption is proportional to the square of the cur-
rent and to the time over which the tip is consumed, which is the power-on time. The correlation is
as follows:
(10.3.1)
or emphasizing the importance of productivity in tons per hour:
(10.3.2)
where
CTIP 5 graphite tip consumption (lbs/ton)
RSUB 5 sublimation rate (lbs/kA2 per hr) 
tPO 5 power-on time (hrs)
I 5 current per phase (kA)
P 5 furnace productivity (tons/heat)
TU 5 time utilization 5 tPO/tTAP
p 5 productivity (tons/hr)
For electrode sidewall consumption, it was found that it is proportional to the oxidizing electrode
surface area and to the relevant time period which is the tap-to-tap time:
(10.3.3)
where
CSIDE 5 graphite sidewall consumption (lbs/ton)
ROX 5 oxidation rate (lbs/ft2 per hr)
AOX 5 oxidizing electrode surface area (square feet)
tTAP 5 tap-to-tap time (hrs)
P 5 furnace productivity (tons/heat)
Below the limit of the water cooling it is sufficiently accurate to approximate the shape of each oxi-
dizing column to a cone, the diameter at the top being the full electrode diameter, D, tapering to
the tip diameter, Dt, at the bottom and the mean of these two diameters, DAV. If the length of this
cone is LOX then the oxidizing area per column is

With optimum water cooling the oxidizing length, LOX, is close to the length of the column inside
the furnace at flat bath. This increases with furnace size and is typically in the 2–4 m (7–12 ft)
range. 
Typical average values for oxidation and sublimation rates are:
ROX 5 average oxidation rate = 8 kg/m2 per hr (1.64 lbs/ft2 per hr) for the oxidizing cone of
water spray cooled electrodes for operations using around 25 Nm3 (900 scf) lance oxy-
gen and no post-combustion.

(0.0298 lbs/kA2 per hr).
Rsub DC 5 average sublimation rate per electrode for DC operation 5 0.0124 kg/kA2 per hr
(0.0273 lbs/kA2 per hr).
10.3.3.2 Updated Bowman Correlations
In 1995 Bowman published an update to the above correlations in order to fit modern arc furnace
practice.9 The loss of accuracy of the old model seems to have occurred with the move to longer
arcs allowed by the application of water-cooled panels. This suggests that arc length, i.e. arc volt-
age, is an important parameter which was not included in the old model. Other significant changes
in arc furnace practice which influence electrode consumption, particularly oxygen consumption
and its method of application needed to be considered in order to establish a new, empirical model
for oxidation consumption.
10.3.3.2.1 Tip Consumption
The old model for tip consumption, contained current squared and a
function for the tip diameter. The link with tip diameter was necessary in order to conserve a rela-
tionship with the square of the current, which seemed to be correct on both theoretical and exper-
imental grounds. The relation suggested that with larger electrodes, consumption rates decreased.
However, larger electrodes are also associated generally with higher voltages. Thus a link to volt-
age is used in the new model and the link with electrode diameter has been dropped.
The evidence for a dependence on the square of the current is very strong; the data analysis in the
original report showed a very good fit over a very large range of values, from 1–60 kA and almost
four orders of magnitude of consumption rate. In order to identify the form of the dependence on
arc voltage, the strong effect of the current can be eliminated by dividing measured tip consump-
tion rates by kA2 and plotting the resulting data as a function of arc voltage. The data for the old
model were grouped mostly below the 200 arc voltage limit. Newer data covers higher arc voltages
approaching 400 volts. Below an arc voltage of about 250 V there is an increase in the specific con-
sumption rate; above 250 V the rate is more or less constant.
Long periods of arcing onto a slag covered bath are a common feature of operations with more than
70% continuously charged DRI or continuously charged processes such as Consteel. Measure-
ments show that such operations consistently yield figures in the 0.010 kg/kA2 (0.0221 lbs/kA2)
per hour range. Some furnaces running with 100% scrap also achieve these low figures; others,
however, reach up to 0.016 kg/kA2 (0.0353 lbs/kA2) per hour. The difference between these two
groups of furnaces seems to show up in the angle of the electrode tip. Operations with the higher
levels of specific consumption rate are characterized by steep tip angles, up to 45° on meltdown;
the lower levels seem to go along with tip angles  in the 25–30° range. Bowman offers the follow-
ing hypotheses to answer the questions why the tip consumption rate depends on tip angle and why
the tip angles vary between furnaces.
10.3.3.2.1.1 Dependence of Tip Consumption Rate on Tip Angle
For ladle furnaces, increasing tip con-
sumption rate with shorter arcs can be explained by the dissolution of graphite due to splashing by
the liquid steel. In the case of melting furnaces, the geometry of the arcing volume around the elec-
trode tip illustrates that for a given average arc voltage the lower part of the tip comes closer to the
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

liquid as the angle increases. Thus, at a tip angle of 40° the gap between graphite and steel is only
about two inches at an average arc of 200 volt. In contrast, at 25° it is over three inches at 200 V.
At 300 V the corresponding gaps are about five inches and seven inches respectively. The proba-
bility of graphite contact with steel is therefore increased with greater tip angles and lower arc
voltages.
10.3.3.2.1.2 Variation of Tip Angles between Furnaces
Arc blowout, the cause of tip angling, is a mag-
netic phenomenon. It depends on the proximity of the electrodes, i.e. pitch circle diameter (PCD),
the distribution of the ferromagnetic scrap and the current distribution within the charge, between
the arcs. It has also been suggested that deep, foaming slag can offer magnetic field protection. For
a given current, the parameters which can generate low or high magnetic fields in the arc regions
can be summarized in Table 10.2.
Thus a liquid heel operation with maximum time on deep, foaming slag promotes the lower tip
angles. Those operations without a hot heel and with shallow slag depths such as stainless steel or
acid iron production, are likely to generate steeper tip angles during meltdown.
In long-arc-only operations tip angle tends to stay constant. Tip consumption rates on DC arc fur-
naces are associated with long arcs and tip angles are usually below 10°. These parameters, as dis-
cussed above for AC, should not therefore play a role in consumption. 
Based on DC operating data covering the current range 10–130 kA and arc voltages from about
250–550 volts, Bowman found that the specific tip consumption rate is essentially constant at
0.0124 kg/kA2 (0.0273 lbs/kA2) per hour, taking into account the experimental errors. No depen-
dence on arc voltage was apparent, as expected from the AC analysis above.
Arc voltage is normally not available on most arc furnaces. Bowman indicates that an accurate
value can, however, be calculated from readily available electrical data, in this case MW and kA as
follows

where the r represents the phase resistance, in milliOhm. Typical values, if not known from a short

Summarizing, Table 10.4 presents the following specific sublimation rates taking the varying
voltage ranges and tip angles into account:
10.3.3.2.2 Sidewall Oxidation
A number of studies have been published which show that there are
important differences in the degree to which furnace practice exposes the graphite electrodes
to oxidation. These differences are reflected in varying specific rates of oxidation, expressed as
kg/m2 per hr (lbs/ft2 per hr). Low rates occur with a low oxygen consumption practice and low
ingress of air. A continuously charged DRI operation of relatively long duration with a closed
furnace and no oxygen lancing is a good example. At the other extreme an operation using large
volumes of oxygen, perhaps with burners and post-combustion injection, tends to produce higher
specific rates of oxidation. Surface area exposed to oxidation is a major parameter which influ-
ences oxidation consumption. Direct water cooling of the electrodes has helped to reduce this
area in AC furnaces. In DC furnaces the use of only one electrode further reduces the area sig-
nificantly.
With such varying oxygen practices in modern operations, it is necessary to assume a varying spe-
cific rate of oxidation, kg/m2 per hr (lbs/ft2 per hr), based on furnace practice. Oxidation rates are
dependent on several features of the use of oxygen (and burners if used) which are often not
recorded or not under control:  lance angle, lance direction relative to the electrodes, oxygen flow
rate and lance diameter, position of the lance tip relative to steel and slag levels, burner excess oxy-
gen levels and duration. In many furnaces the lower parts of the graphite columns are heavily
splashed by FeO-rich slag or incompletely reacted oxygen. Post-combustion of CO by injection of
oxygen above the slag level can also increase electrode oxidation rates because CO2 also reacts
with graphite.
To account for such varying practices Table 10.5 presents the following range of specific oxidation
rates that have been calculated from measurements on various furnaces:

Water cooling of the electrodes above the roof is now standard practice and has helped to reduce
wasteful oxidation of electrodes outside the furnace. However, excessive flows of water will cause
an increase in energy consumption, the cost of which normally exceeds any gain in graphite sav-
ings. Ideally the water should convert to steam within the roof port, providing some protection to
the refractory delta insert. The flow rate to achieve this condition depends on escaping flame inten-
sity and current, but typically may require between 380–680 litres (100–180 gal) per hour per one
24 inch electrode. If the flow rate is in excess of the optimum then water is effectively pouring into
the furnace, exiting via the extraction system as steam at high temperature.
10.3.4 Current Carrying Capacity
Limits for current carrying capacity have been developed with the objective of minimizing elec-
trode consumption. Generally, exceeding these limits will result in increased consumption via the
discontinuous consumption mechanisms, electrode breakage, butt losses, and spalling. Thus the
decision to exceed these limits must weigh increased graphite consumption against increased EAF
productivity. Current carrying capacities are given in Fig. 10.42.
The current carrying capacity is greater for DC than for AC electrodes. Under AC conditions, the
current is forced towards the peripheral region of the electrode. This is known as skin effect. Under
DC conditions, the full electrode cross section is available for the current flow. That is why the elec-
trode resistance under DC conditions, RDC, is apparently lower than the resistance, RAC, under AC
conditions. Consequently, the current can be increased under DC over that for AC conditions with-
out increasing the resulting Joule’s heating in the electrode. Some typical examples are given in
Table 10.6.
Besides electrical influences, the current carrying capacity is mainly affected by thermal and
mechanical boundary conditions and by the material characteristics of graphite. Again, exceeding
these boundary conditions will lead to an increase of the discontinuous consumption processes.
10.3.5 Discontinuous Consumption Processes 
Discontinuous electrode consumption has been studied extensively by Lefrank et al. with the
objective to improve electrode performance specifically for DC operations.10 The discontinuous

consumption processes are results of mechanically or thermally induced stresses which exceed the
electrode strength limits. Stress levels of this magnitude occur as electrode tip stresses at the arc
foot point or as hoop stresses around the electrode joints. Tip stress leads to tip spalling. Hoop
stresses lead to column breakage and butt losses.
10.3.5.1 Butt Losses
Current, temperature, and stress distributions for a 28 inch electrode, operated at 120 kA under AC
and DC conditions, are shown schematically in Fig. 10.43.
Under AC conditions, most of the current is flowing through the peripheral region of the electrode.
Under DC conditions, more current will flow through the electrode center resulting in an almost
evenly distributed, and lower maximum current density than under AC conditions. As a result the
DC electrode generates more energy inside the electrode and therefore the temperature gradient is
much higher in DC electrodes. Consequently, the hoop stress gradients are much greater for DC
conditions. As the electrode diameter and current loads are increased this situation will be ampli-
fied further. This phenomenon is a result of the finite graphite thermal conductivity and the
reduced capacity of the larger electrode for radiant heat transfer resulting from a reduced surface
to volume ratio. Electrode joints are affected even more by the central flow of current in DC oper-
ations and potentially, the nipple can overheat resulting in joint opening and socket splitting.

10.3.5.2 Tip Spalling
Very high current densities develop at the arc spot on an electrode due to the self-magnetic pinch
effect. For DC operations with only one electrode, the tip stresses are higher than for AC opera-
tions. The arc spot will move around the tip of the electrode in a random manner but sometimes in
DC operation, the arc spot will tend to fix preferentially on one location. This will result in the gen-
eration of longitudinal splits and severe butt losses. Improvements in arc deflection control have
improved this situation reducing butt losses significantly.
10.3.5.3 Breakage
State of the art AC operations experience few electrode breaks, typically less than two to three per
month. However, frequent top joint opening and breakage some time after an electrode addition
have been reported by some DC shops. It was hypothesized that a rotational arc movement in some
DC operations might generate a clockwise tangential force to the electrode axis leading to the
unwinding of the top column joint. For this reason, Lefrank et al. conducted a comprehensive high
speed video motion analysis of the arc behavior at major DC furnace operations of different fur-
nace design in the U.S.
The videos show that the DC arc spot is moving with high speed randomly over the electrode tip.
The arc spot movement seems to be influenced by the combination of totally random events with
controlled, directional forces.
The directional forces are the result of the powerful magnetic fields generated by the DC current
loop of the furnace. They can restrict the arc spot to a limited area of the electrode tip and may
direct the arc jet preferentially to one furnace side which is shown in Fig. 10.44. Depending on the
furnace design, they can also force the arc to rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise for a few
hundred milliseconds, but then the arc spot will again move in a totally random and unpredictable
way over the electrode tip for prolonged time periods.
The results of this study clearly indicate that a stable DC arc direction or continuous arc rotation
did not exist in any of the investigated DC furnaces. Therefore, the phenomenon of top joint open-
ing of DC electrode columns must be generated mainly by the absence of the self tightening,

counter clockwise, electromagnetic force which helps AC operation to maintain tight joints as
shown in Fig. 10.45.
Lower powered DC operations suffer specifically from the heat sink effect which is caused by
every electrode addition as demonstrated in Fig. 10.46. At low power levels, the necessary thermal
nipple expansion supporting the tightness of the top joint does not happen fast enough. The
absence of the self-tightening AC effect will be aggravated under these conditions through furnace
vibrations, excessive water spray cooling, and,  if pitch plugs are used, through joint lubrication by
the liquid pitch between 150–250°C.
For higher powered DC operations, the failure mechanism seems to be different. In this case, the
contact resistance between the electrode end faces may become too high for the extreme current
levels. This phenomenon can be the combined result of the missing self-tightening AC effect, ques-
tionable joint design, inadequate tightening torque, or poor electrode addition practice. As a con-
sequence, the current will flow preferentially through the nipple. This can lead to overheating of
the nipple to its creep temperature which will result in joint breakage.
A number of counter measures can be taken to prevent these failures. The design of electrodes and
nipples should be adjusted by the electrode producer to the demanding DC joint conditions (con-
tact resistance as a function of surface finish, expansion coefficients, and dimensions). DC elec-
trode joints should be locked by nailing after each electrode addition. DC operations should not
use the electrode water spray system for at least twenty minutes after each electrode addition. DC
shops, with an abnormal number of top joint breaks should apply automated, off- furnace electrode
additions or use the automatic on-furnace addition devices available in the marketplace. DC shops
should apply the recommended, high tightening torque moments. Table 10.7 presents published
torque levels.
10.3.6 Comparison of AC and DC Electrode Consumption
There has been much speculation over the past few years as to the true electrode savings for DC
operation compared with AC operation. An analysis by Bowman indicated the following. For a

given size of operation, the DC electrode tip consumption is larger than the combined tip con-
sumption of all three AC electrodes. This is due to the much higher operating current for the DC
electrode. DC electrode consumption savings result mainly from reduced sidewall oxidation.
Overall savings can be expected to be approximately 25%.
Lefrank et al. have calculated continuous electrode consumption for the DC furnace shops opera-
tional in the US in 1995.10 Then, they compared the calculated consumption figures with the actu-
ally observed consumption as shown in Table 10.8. They assumed that the difference between
calculated and observed consumption would be equivalent to the amount of discontinuous con-
sumption:  breakage, butt losses, and tip spalling. The resulting dependence of discontinuous con-
sumption on average phase current is shown in Fig. 10.47. It is important to note that the data
points for the current levels above 100 kA are averages for 28 in. and 30 in., with the 28 in. per-
forming worst and the 30 in. performing best.
With this data, DC operations in the United States can be divided into three major electrode con-
sumption groups:
1. DC furnaces operating below 110 kA:  Predominantly continuous, low electrode
consumption is achieved with electrodes of 28 in. and smaller diameter. Overall

electrode savings of 25%, as estimated in Bowman’s AC versus DC comparison, are
realistic for these operations.
2. DC furnaces operating between 110 and 130 kA:  Discontinuous consumption
processes increase dramatically with phase currents above 110 kA. Electrodes of 30
in. diameter are necessary to control breaks, butt losses, and spalling. Electrode
consumption savings using 28 in. electrodes are marginal at best when compared to
high impedance AC shops of similar capacity. 
3. DC furnaces operating above 130 kA:  130 kA is currently the maximum recom-
mended current carrying capacity for 30 in. electrodes. DC shops operating above
this level are realizing electrode consumption figures higher than high impedance
AC shops of similar capacity.

10.3.7 Development of Special DC Electrode Grades
In response to demanding DC furnace conditions, graphite producers are developing special DC
electrode grades. SGL Carbon Corp. has published information on a finite element analysis (FEA)
model for the evaluation of the influence of graphite property changes on thermal stress genera-
tion in electrode columns under DC conditions.11 Using the information provided by the model
along with actual data from DC operations, new electrode nipple systems are being produced for
DC applications. 
The modifications evaluated have concentrated on:
1. Reduction of joint resistance in combination with high strength nipples with lower
thermal expansion coefficients to reduce thermal joint stress and failure
2. Reduction of specific electrode resistivity to lower the generation of thermal
stresses resulting from Joule’s heating of the electrode center.
3. Enhancement of transverse thermal conductivity to transport the heat from the elec-
trode center faster to the surface.
4. Reduction of coefficients of thermal electrode expansion to lower thermal stress
from electrode expansion.
5. Improvement of homogeneity and coarseness of electrodes to increase resistance to
crack initiation and propagation.
Shown in Fig 10.48 is an example of the resulting stress levels calculated by the FEA program from
the current flow pattern inside the electrode column and the resulting temperature distribution. The
material properties of Table 10.9 were used to generate this FEA plot. All columns in this example
are loaded with 86 kA.
The FEA results confirm that the highest tangential stress levels are being developed around the
bottom joint. Going from the 24 in. electrode with AC graphite properties to the 28 in. electrode
with DC graphite properties reduces the joint stress from 2465 to 1160 psi.

The maximum tangential joint stress from the FEA calculations as a function of phase current is
shown in Fig. 10.49. In addition, the strength range for electrode graphite at 2000°C is shown as a
bar. Below this level the DC electrodes will mainly be consumed in a continuous way. Above this
limit, discontinuous consumption will gradually commence. The FEA data coincide well with elec-
trode performance observations in the field.
It is interesting to note that the FEA model predicts start of discontinuous consumption around 110 kA
even for a 30 in. electrode with improved properties. Some DC operations are designed to use oper-
ating currents up to 160 kA. Thus, further substantial improvements in electrode material proper-
ties will be necessary to control breakage, butt losses, and splitting at such operating currents.
Increasing DC electrode diameters beyond 30 in. would improve the current carrying capacity, but
with decreasing efficiency because the thermomechanical stresses in these electrodes will increase
exponentially with increasing diameter. Alternatively, the current load for high powered DC oper-
ations can be distributed over two electrodes with the objective to reduce electrode stress levels.
Two DC arc furnaces with double electrode systems have recently started operation. Reliable per-
formance comparisons are not yet known.

10.4 Gas Collection and Cleaning
Over the past 30 years electric arc furnace fume systems have evolved considerably from very sim-
ple systems aimed at improving the ambient work environment around the furnace to sophisticated
systems aimed at controlling not only the emission of particulate but also the control of toxic gases.
Modern fume systems are now designed to minimize the formation of toxic gases and to ensure
that others are destroyed before exiting the system. Thus gas cleaning in the modern day fume sys-
tem entails considerably more than trapping and collection of particulate.
Initially, electric arc furnaces operated without any emissions control. In the earlier days, operators
merely sought to improve workplace conditions in order to increase productivity. The advent of
environmental regulations saw the progress of primary fume control on electric arc furnaces from
side draft hoods (SDH), through furnace roof hoods, to rudimentary fourth hole extraction sys-
tems, culminating in today’s sophisticated direct evacuation systems (DES).
10.4.1 Early Fume Control Methods
As mentioned above, early electric arc furnaces operated without any emissions control and oper-
ators merely sought to improve workplace conditions. Most of the EAFs were relatively small in
size and in some cases the roof was stationary. As a result many of the early fume control systems
involved a roof mounted type of furnace hood. These allowed for effective fume control without
requiring elaborate pressure control in the furnace. In addition fume collection did not adversely
affect the steel metallurgy. For larger furnaces (>5 metre diameter), furnace hoods were cumber-
some and not generally recommended. Typical examples of furnace hoods included the side draft
hood, the full roof type hood and the close fitting (donut) hood. Another method that was some-
times used was a mobile canopy hood that is local to the EAF. These are discussed in more detail
in the following sections.
10.4.1.1 Side Draft Hood (SDH)
A side draft hood is depicted in Fig. 10.50(a). This type of furnace hood picked up the furnace
fume as it exited the electrode ports. Additional branches were sometimes used to collect emissions
from the slag door and from the tapping spout. Gas cooling was accomplished by bleed-in air.
Typical advantages of this type of hood include:  minimal air volume required to give effective con-
trol, no interference with electrode stroke, no effect on steel metallurgy, hood does not need to be
removed when changing the roof, and complete accessibility to furnace roof components.12
Disadvantages include:  cumbersome for large furnaces, fume escapes at roof ring if there is not a
good seal, and difficult to get good capture at B phase due to electrode configuration.
10.4.1.2 Full Roof Type Hood
The full roof type hood configuration is shown in Fig.10.50(b). The full roof type hood encloses
the roof entirely allowing for capture of any fume exiting the upper portion of the EAF. This hood
design is often less expensive than the side draft design but has several disadvantages:  electrode
stroke is decreased by 15–24 in. depending on the furnace size, parts of the hood must be removed
when the furnace roof is changed, hood covers entire top of EAF making maintenance difficult,
openings around the periphery of the hood make fume control difficult, hood has difficulty han-
dling very large offgas volumes, and requires refractory lined or water-cooled sections above the
electrode openings in the EAF.13
The Pangborn modified full roof hood is shown in Fig. 10.50(c). This has the following advantages
over the standard full hood configuration:  better utilization of ventilation air (lower volumes than
full hood), some fume pickup during furnace charging, less weight than a full hood, and less time
required for roof change.14

10.4.1.3 Close Fitting Hood
The close fitting hood is shown in Fig. 10.50(d). This type of hood is only really applicable for
small furnaces. This hood can only be used if the roof is not raised during oxygen lancing. The
hood is generally constructed of stainless steel, heavy reinforced carbon plate or may be water-
cooled. The main section has a built-in frame that is mounted to the furnace roof ring. The section
over the slag door is permanently attached to the bezel ring. This hood arrangement is relatively
tight and gives excellent fume control. Disadvantages include reduction of the electrode stroke and
difficulty in accessing the roof. This type of design has been incorporated into ladle furnace roofs
for fume control.
10.4.1.4 Mobile Canopy Hood
The mobile canopy hood is as its name suggests, a mobile hood that is moved into position above
the furnace to capture fume as it rises from the furnace. This type of hood is only suitable for very
small furnace operations (less than 10 tons). A mobile canopy hood is shown in Fig. 10.50(e).

The snorkel system originated in Germany and is used on larger furnaces melting open hearth
grade steels.12 The snorkel system configuration is shown in Fig. 10.50(f). The system employs a
fourth hole in the furnace roof followed by a water-cooled elbow. The snorkel is a funnel shaped
section of duct that can be retracted with a motor or hydraulic system. The snorkel captures fume
as it exits the furnace elbow. The gap between the elbow and the snorkel, 5–120 cm (2–48 in.),
allows air to enter the system. This air provides oxygen for combustion and also provides dilution
cooling for the system. The fourth hole serves only as a natural pressure release for the furnace.
During periods of heavy fume emission, the snorkel is moved closer to the elbow to provide greater
suction. The furnace atmosphere remains undisturbed and theoretically operates at a positive pres-
sure at all times.

10.4.2 Modern EAF Fume Control
Essentially all phases of normal EAF operation result in either primary or secondary emissions.
Primary emissions are those that are produced during EAF melting and refining operations.
Secondary emissions are those that result from charging, tapping and also from escape of fume
from the EAF (usually from the electrode ports and/or roof ring). Primary emissions are generally
controlled using a direct evacuation system. Secondary emissions are captured using canopy hoods
and in some cases auxiliary tapping hoods.
10.4.2.1 Direct Evacuation Systems
The Direct Evacuation System (DES) or fourth hole system as it is commonly known, is probably
the most prevalent fume control system in meltshops today. An electric arc furnace (EAF) offgas
system is comprised of containment, cooling and collecting elements.15 Total offgas handling usu-
ally involves a direct evacuation system (DES) and a secondary fugitive capture system consisting
of a canopy hood in the shop roof.
In a typical DES system, containment components include the fourth hole, system ducting and the
fan. Cooling is achieved by elements such as water-cooled ducting, dilution air cooling, evapora-
tive cooling and forced or natural draft heat exchangers.15 The latter three provide gas cooling
without increasing the collector size. 
Particulate collection is typically achieved with a baghouse, though scrubbers and electrostatic pre-
cipitators are used in some cases.
A good offgas system is one that combines the containment, cooling and collecting elements eco-
nomically to provide effective fume control within regulatory standards, for both the meltshop and
external environments.
A modern DES addresses not only particulate capture but also control of CO, NOx and VOC
emissions. 
The main advantages of a DES system are:  it requires the lowest offtake volume for furnace fume
control, it provides the most effective method for fume capture in UHP steelmaking, it allows low
interference with meltshop operations, it requires minimal space on the furnace roof, and it
addresses the issues of CO and VOC combustion. The main disadvantages of DES systems are:
excessive in-draft leads to increased power requirements and undesired metallurgical effects, and
it is difficult to control the furnace freeboard pressure when offgas surges occur. A typical system
flowsheet is given in Fig. 10.51.

10.4.2.2 DES Design Methodology
Design of an offgas system requires consideration of several steps including containment of fur-
nace fume, the reaction processes going on in the furnace, and processes through the offgas sys-
tem itself. In the past there has not been enough collaboration of the furnace operator with the
offgas system designer. As a result it has been difficult to provide systems which matched opera-
tions within the meltshop. Without a clear understanding of the furnace operations, it is not possi-
ble to design an appropriate offgas system.
Essentially, the design of the offgas system involves a detailed mass and energy balance around the
EAF to provide the basis for gas quantity and heat content leaving the EAF. There are a variety of
furnace process factors that influence the peak offgas flow rate and the peak heat load contained
in the offgas. These factors include the charge weight, the scrap mix (its oil, combustible material
and moisture contents), furnace power and power-on time, tap-to-tap time, furnace openings and
associated air infiltration (slag door, electrode ports, roof ring, auxiliary ports), oxy-fuel burner
and oxygen lance rates and duration of use, carbon injection rates, and use of alternative iron
sources and feed rate.
Both the gas quantity and its heat content affect the sizing of the DES system. It should be noted
that the system fan is a constant volume device. The fan is capable of moving a greater mass of off-
gas if the offgas is cooler (the cooler the offgas, the lower its volume). At the same time, the fan
motor has a limited power rating. As a result, to provide maximum evacuation for a given DES sys-
tem configuration, it is desired to cool the offgas as much as possible but at the same time ensure
that we are staying within the amp current rating of the fan. Thus, it is common to modulate the
fan damper position based on the fan motor current and an acceptable setpoint.
In order to keep the gas cleaning system cost economical, it is usual to cool the offgas prior to the
baghouse. This allows for use of lower cost bag materials and also keeps the volume of gas to be
cleaned to a minimum.
It is important to note that not all of the heat content in the offgas is necessarily sensible heat. If
the offgas contains non-combusted species such as CO, a significant amount of energy can be con-
tained in the offgas. This not only represents increased heat removal duty for the offgas system, but
also energy lost to the melting process and hence an inefficiency.
The furnace heat cycle includes phases such as flash-off (the first few minutes of melting when the
moisture and volatile components of the scrap mix are driven off by the applied heat), melting,
which can have several operational phases depending upon the use of oxy-fuel burners, oxygen
lancing or DRI additions, and refining, which can be broken down into periods of oxygen lancing,
carbon injection and foamy slag practices. It is important to analyze all of these phases to deter-
mine the peak offgas flow rate and peak heat load.
Frequently the peak load in terms of gas volume occurs during the first few minutes of melting,
when the volatile materials burn and flash-off. However, refining is often seen to result in the high-
est offgas temperatures during oxygen lancing for carbon removal. Operations where DRI is added
continuously can lead to high evolution rates of CO gas. CO evolution rates can be even greater
during iron carbide addition. If this CO does not burn in the furnace, high heat loads to the offgas
system will result.
Typical peak load offgas characteristics at the fourth hole for effective EAF emission control are
an offgas flow rate of 4–6 Nm3 (150–200 scf) per ton per hour tapped and an offgas temperature
of 1370–1925°C (2500–3500°F).
Fourth hole sizes are selected on the basis of a design offgas velocity in the range of 2400–
3000 m/min (8000–10,000 ft/min). The gas velocity at the fourth hole is important because it will
affect the system pressure drop at the fourth hole and also will affect the amount of material which
will carry over from the furnace to the offgas system. In some cases, slag and scrap will be carried
over into the offgas system.

A good understanding of the furnace processes and how they affect the offgas characteristics is
necessary for the process engineer to design an efficient and cost effective DES. Once the flow rate
and heat content for emission control at the fourth hole has been determined for the EAF, the
required performance of the DES has been defined. If some of the components of an existing sys-
tem are to be retained (e.g. system fan, baghouse) then certain limitations on the total allowable
system pressure drop will also be fixed. Definition of the heat content of the offgases also fixes
the amount of cooling required prior to routing the offgas to a given baghouse filter operation. The
fourth hole serves as the union between the furnace and the DES.
In order to control fume emissions, it is necessary to maintain a slight negative pressure within the
furnace. This pressure is typically in the range of –0.09 to –0.18 mm Hg (–0.05 to –0.1 in. W.G.).
It is important to limit the resultant in-draft to the minimum required to contain fume generated by
the melting process. Higher in-draft results in heat losses from the furnace and higher offgas flow
rates. Test results presented by Bender indicate that a negative pressure of –0.09 mm Hg (–0.05 in.
W.G.) will usually prevent electrode emissions when scrap cave-ins occur.16 Bender shows, based
on measurements at Von Moos Stahl (Swiss Steel AG), that operating with too high a negative pres-
sure can increase the electrical power requirement by approximately 45 kWh/ton. Previous trials
on several furnaces in Japan indicated that running the furnace at positive pressure gave power sav-
ings of 10–20 kWh per ton.
Furnace openings of significance are usually the electrode ports, the roof ring gap, the slag door
and auxiliary ports in the furnace sidewall (decarburization oxygen lance, solids injection etc.).
The minimizing of these openings improves the efficiency of both the furnace and the emission
control system. Openings that occur higher up in the furnace are less critical than those which
occur low in the furnace due to the pressure profile across the height of the furnace. The pressure
tap which is used to measure the pressure used for furnace draft control is located in the furnace
roof. If the system controls to the pressure setpoint at the roof level, the negative pressure at the
low furnace openings such as the slag door will be much greater. The flowrate of air into the fur-
nace through openings is proportional to the square root of the differential between the furnace
pressure and the ambient pressure. As a result the infiltration rate will be much higher at the open-
ings lower in the furnace.
Early in the meltdown phase, furnace openings will not result in much air infiltration because the
scrap will act as a resistance to infiltration flow. However, later in the cycle when oxygen lances
are inserted through the slag door, considerable air infiltration can result.
The fourth hole serves as the union between furnace operations and the DES. Gases exiting the
fourth hole enter the water-cooled elbow mounted on the furnace roof. Generally, there is a gap
between the furnace roof and the water-cooled elbow which admits air due to the negative pres-
sure. The air mixing with the offgases provides opportunity for further combustion of offgas and/or
dilution cooling. In general the mass of air drawn into this first gap matches the mass of gas flow-
ing out of the fourth hole.
A second gap that allows the furnace to tilt and the furnace roof to swing is normally situated
between the water-cooled elbow exit and the entrance to the water-cooled duct. This gap admits
additional infiltration air which may provide some further combustion as well as dilution cooling.
In some cases a duct section similar to a snorkel is located following the gap. This section is
adjustable typically to give a gap of 2.5–12 cm (1–5 in.). This allows better control of the negative
pressure in the furnace freeboard and is often necessary in providing sufficient retraction to enable
the furnace roof to swing without interference. Again, in general, the mass of air entering the sec-
ond gap is similar to the total mass exiting the elbow.
Thus the DES typically exhausts a mass flow that is about four times that which actually exits the
furnace at the fourth hole. Generally the designer prefers that these final exhaust gases contain
100% of oxygen in excess of the combustion needs for all combustibles generated in the furnace
process.

There have been many innovations to the water-cooled elbow design in recent years. While it is rec-
ognized that sufficient combustion air needs to be introduced to ensure combustion of all VOCs
and CO in the water-cooled duct, it is also necessary to ensure that excessive air is not introduced
which could lead to over cooling of the offgas and non-combusted material downstream in the sys-
tem. Flanges (also known as elephant ears), are sometimes welded around the water-cooled duct
and the elbow so that the amount of air infiltration can be better controlled. The water-cooled duct
is sometimes sized larger than the elbow so that efficient capture can still be achieved even when
the furnace is tilted 65°. One of the more recent innovations is to use a very steep elbow config-
uration which will help to reduce slag buildup. Bender recommends that this type of elbow be cou-
pled with a high velocity water-cooled duct entrance followed by a sharp bend downward.16 This
configuration provides for good turbulence for mixing and combustion of the CO and slag can fall
out into a dropout box located below. Good mixing of the gas is very important to ensure complete
combustion.
Water-cooled ducting is used to cool the offgas and also to contain the offgas combustion reaction
heat which would otherwise damage carbon steel ductwork. In some older systems, refractory lined
ductwork was used but with improved design and lower costs; water-cooled duct is now the pre-
ferred choice. Water-cooled duct is also generally less maintenance intensive. It is important how-
ever, to ensure that water-cooled duct is accessible so that routine maintenance can be performed.
In many of the newer meltshop installations, the water-cooled duct has a sharp downward bend fol-
lowing the combustion gap. A dropout box is located at the bottom of this bend and then a hori-
zontal run of water-cooled duct is located at grade. This makes it easier to use forklift trucks to
remove sections of the duct for maintenance. This also makes the duct accessible for periodic
cleanout of any dust buildup which might occur. Some planning is required to ensure that the lay-
out of the ducting does not interfere with other operations.
The gas temperature at the end of the water-cooled ducting is typically 650–760°C (1200–1400°F).
Below this range, water-cooled ducting is no longer an efficient method of cooling due to low heat
transfer coefficients. Typically offgas flowrates at the water-cooled duct exit for effective EAF
emission control are 14–23 Nm3 (500–800 scf) per ton per hour tapped.
10.4.2.3 Gas Cooling
Prior to entering the carbon steel dry ducting, dilution, evaporative or non-contact cooling is gen-
erally used to cool the gas so that the duct wall temperature is well below 425°C (800°F). This gen-
erally equates to a gas temperature of about 650–760°C (1200–1400°F).
Evaporative cooling consists of spraying atomized water into the offgas stream. The water will
evaporate, absorbing a large quantity of energy. Evaporative cooling is usually carried out follow-
ing the water-cooled duct. This can be carried out in a spray chamber or in the ductwork. If carried
out in ductwork, care must be taken that the water stream evaporates fully before it strikes the duct
wall. The evaporation rate is dependent on the water flowrate, the spray angle, quantity of atomiz-
ing air, the water droplet size and the presence of contaminant films on the droplet. Evaporative
cooling will result in a decrease in offgas volume and is usually the most cost effective method for
achieving this because it involves the minimum amount of equipment. The only potential downside
to this technology is the possibility of condensation occurring if the offgas becomes saturated. It is
important to evaluate the total moisture content of the combined DES and secondary offgases
entering the baghouse. If a dewpoint problem exists, condensation will occur which can affect bag
performance and life. If this is the case, an alternative to evaporative cooling may have to be
selected.
Dilution cooling consists of adding air to the offgas stream to cool it. This will always result in a
larger gas volume and increases the required capacity of the fume extraction system. This is the
lowest cost method for cooling of the offgas but may adversely affect the cost of system compo-
nents downstream.

Non-contact cooling is carried out using forced draft coolers or hair pin coolers. The gas is cooled
by transferring heat to the wall of the cooler which in turn transfers heat to the outer surface of the
tube or duct wall. The net result is to cool the offgas without an increase in offgas volume. Though
this is an efficient method for gas cooling which does not result in increased gas volume, it is the
most expensive method and requires the greatest amount of equipment.
Further cooling is provided by dilution air drawn in through the canopy hood and mixed with the
DES offgases to reduce the combined gas temperature to around 120°C (250°F) before entering the
baghouse. The reason for this is to allow polyester filter media to be used. Polyester is an economic
filter media commonly used in EAF air pollution control (APC) systems with a design tempera-
ture limit of 120°C (250°F) for continuous operation.
Gas velocities in the DES system ductwork are important for many reasons. If the gas velocity is
too high, large system pressure drops will result and there is the potential for increased duct wear.
If the gas velocity is too low, the particulate in the offgas will settle out in the ductwork. This will
also lead to higher system pressure drop and poses a maintenance problem. It has been found in
practice that a design velocity of 4000–5000 fpm at standard conditions is optimum for meeting
both dust entrainment and economic criteria.
For any configuration, a detailed mass and energy balance must be performed on each DES sys-
tem component to yield gas flows, temperatures, velocities and pressure losses throughout the
entire system. Analysis of various system configurations can be a tedious and time consuming
process. As a result, several system designers have incorporated all of the necessary calculations
into a computer model. Thus, the effect of changes in process and system design can be evaluated
quickly allowing for greater optimization of system design. A typical DES is shown in Fig. 10.52.
10.4.3 Secondary Emissions Control 
Control of secondary fume emissions from furnace charging, tapping and slagging operations
became strictly regulated subsequent to regulations for primary control. Secondary emissions also
result from offgas escaping the furnace around the electrodes and at the roof ring. Initial treatment
of secondary emissions were provided by generally inefficient canopy hoods at roof truss level.

Modern systems tend to provide much greater evacuation capacity. The sizing of the secondary
fume control system is the controlling factor of the overall sizing of the gas cleaning system
because secondary extraction tends to be four to six times that required for the DES.
10.4.3.1 Canopy Hoods
Canopy hoods were installed initially to capture primary furnace emissions. As furnace operations
became larger, a need arose for control of secondary fume emissions during charging and tapping
operations. The canopy hood was chosen to fulfill this need because it could capture these emis-
sions without interfering with operations. Canopy hoods are located in the building trusses above
the crane runway. In North America, canopy hoods now form an integral part of modern meltshop
fume control systems. The canopy system is throttled back during furnace operation and provides
air for dilution cooling of the DES offgases prior to entering the baghouse. During charging and
tapping operations the DES does not draw any fume and full extraction capacity is diverted to the
canopy hood.
The ability of a canopy hood to capture fume depends on the face area of the canopy, the canopy
shape, the canopy volume, the amount of interference presented by the charging/tapping crane, the
air flowrate at the canopy face, heat sources within the meltshop (which may cause errant drafts),
the height of the canopy hood above the furnace, and the absence of cross drafts within the melt-
shop.
Many canopy systems are compartmentalized so that one portion of the canopy is used for charg-
ing emissions control while another section is used for tapping emissions. With the move towards
the use of bottom tapping furnaces, it is impractical to attempt fume control during tapping with a
canopy and it is now common to use a side hood for capture of tapping fumes. Hood capture can
be greatly affected by cross drafts in the shop and by thermal gradients within the shop. Thus it is
important to try to keep doorways closed and to eliminate heats sources as much as possible. One
simple way of reducing thermal gradients is to duct ladle preheater gases outside the building.
Removal of full slag pots from the building can also provide beneficial effects.
10.4.3.2 Deep Storage Canopy Hoods
Many canopy hood designs are incapable of handling the large plumes generated, particularly dur-
ing charging. The solution is to provide for temporary storage of this fume until it can be extracted
by the fume system. The result is a deep
storage type canopy hood which has a stor-
age volume of five to ten times that of a con-
ventional canopy hood.17 It provides a large
storage capacity that is capable of temporar-
ily storing the large surge in fume emissions
experienced during furnace charging and
allows the fume to be extracted by the gas
cleaning system over an extended period of
time. This allows the total extraction capac-
ity of the fume system to be lower and yet
still meet surge requirements that occur dur-
ing furnace charging. The design has been
verified using physical fluid dynamic mod-
eling and shows greatly improved capture
characteristics as compared to conventional
technology. There are several successful
installations in North America. The Irish
Steel installation was the first of its kind in
Europe.17 The concept is illustrated in 
Fig. 10.53.

10.4.3.3 Furnace Enclosures
Furnace enclosures (also known as doghouses,
snuff boxes or clean houses) are located on the
operating floor of the melt shop and totally
enclose the furnace. The enclosure generally
provides sufficient room for the roof swing and
working space around the furnace. A typical
configuration is shown in Fig. 10.54. The charge
bucket is brought in above the furnace through
access doors in one side of the enclosure. The
enclosure is low enough that the crane can pass
over it. In some cases there is an air curtain
sealed slot in the roof of the enclosure that
allows the crane cables access when charging to
the furnace. Fume is extracted at the roof level
adjacent to one of the enclosure walls. Makeup
air enters through openings in the operating
floor. Tapping ladles are usually brought in on a transfer car. Most modern enclosure systems also
incorporate a fourth hole system.
Enclosures provide the benefit that all fume is captured and the extraction volume is considerably
less than that required for an equivalent DES/Canopy Hood system. In addition enclosures have
no detrimental effects on metallurgy in the EAF and noise levels are reduced substantially (10–
25 dB A).18 It has been reported that energy savings of up to 20 kWh/ton may be achieved due to
operation of the furnace at positive pressure. Savings due to lower evacuation volumes have been
reported in the range of 10–15 kWh/ton.4
Enclosures offer several advantages including cooler, cleaner, quieter and safer meltshop work-
ing environments, reduced crane maintenance, lower total emissions, and lower fume system
capacity requirements. Some disadvantages include restricted furnace accessibility for furnace
maintenance, retrofit applications may be impractical due to the constraints of the existing
meltshop layout, and furnace charging operations are sometimes slower than for a conventional
meltshop.
In some cases some of the benefits of enclosures can be achieved without fully enclosing the EAF.
These are called partial enclosures and consist of free standing walls which do not restrict crane
access to the furnace. These baffles help to dampen out noise and minimize the effect of cross
drafts within the meltshop.
10.4.3.4 Enclosed Meltshop
An alternative to the furnace enclosure is to close the meltshop and provide total meltshop evacu-
ation. Obviously, the required evacuation capacity for a conventional meltshop layout using this
method is much greater than would be required for a canopy/DES configuration. In addition, inad-
equate extraction could lead to high ambient temperatures in the meltshop and unacceptable work-
ing conditions if dust were to drop out within the shop. The solution to these concerns was to
provide a compact meltshop layout which provides only enough space to accommodate the EAF
and the charging crane. This is shown conceptually in Fig. 10.55. This configuration isolates the
furnace melting operations from all other operations within the steelmaking facility. Scrap buckets
are transported into the enclosed area using transfer cars. Likewise, the tapping ladle is moved
under the furnace on a transfer car. Slag is collected in slag pots which are removed using pot
haulers through a dedicated doorway. This emission control configuration has been implemented
in several meltshops in Europe and in North America and has been shown to be a cost effective
method of providing improved fume control for EAF operation.

10.4.4 Gas Cleaning
Following evaluation of primary and secondary gas extraction requirements, the gas cleaning sys-
tem including system fans, the baghouse and the material handling system can be specified. Some
important aspects of equipment selection and design related to specific parts of the gas cleaning
system are covered in the following sections.
10.4.4.1 System Control
Many operations within the meltshop have fairly constant exhaust requirements which are inde-
pendent of the furnace operation. Such sources (ladle furnace, secondary dedusting) can be effec-
tively controlled using booster fans to maintain constant exhaust flows when required, independent
of the influence of furnace operations, which may switch large exhaust volumes from one source
to another throughout the normal course of furnace operation.
Fume collection systems typically consume 60–100 kWh per ton of good billets produced. As a
result, energy conservation has become an important parameter for melt shop profitability. More
effort is now placed on identifying potential energy savings in emission control systems. Canopy
hood exhaust during charging is by far the largest single exhaust requirement of typical emission
control systems. Outside of the charging period, most systems have capacity in excess of that
required for DES and other secondary requirements. This is usually applied to the canopies as a
simple method of utilizing fan capacity. Some systems achieve significant energy savings by using
variable speed fans. In such a configuration fans are turned down during non-charging periods.
Care must be taken, however, because exhausting excess non-charging capacity through the
canopies is a way of providing general building ventilation, removing excess heat and fugitive
emissions not captured at source. Elimination of this excess capacity may result in higher ambient
temperatures and a dirtier shop. Adjustable speed fans are better suited to operations using furnace
enclosures, which inherently contain and shield the meltshop from heat and fugitive emissions
related to the furnace operations.

10.4.4.2 Fans
Proper specification of fan design parameters is essential to achieve desired fan performance.19 A
typical centrifugal fan performance curve is illustrated in Fig. 10.56. The shape of the system
curve, initiating at the origin of the graph, demonstrates the squared relationship between fan sta-
tic pressure (FSP) and volume flow (i.e. FSP varies directly with the square of Q). The system
curve reflects how the system losses change with variations in flow (note this applies to a single
damper arrangement in the system because changing damper positions can change the system
curve). The fan curve, which intersects the system curve, shows the design FSP produced under
different volume flows. The point of intersection of the two curves represents the operating point
for the system. If the operating point occurs near the top of the fan curve (point of maximum FSP),
unstable surging can result. To avoid this, it is recommended to select an FSP that does not exceed
80% of the maximum FSP. Fans selected near the peak on the pressure curve will be smaller and
therefore cheaper but will be at lower efficiency and have no margin.
Due to the system curve relationship between FSP and volume flow, the recommended margins for
specifying performance are an additional 10% on design flow and 21% on design FSP. The mar-
gins are recommended because fans frequently perform at slightly less than the published fan
curve. Some margin should also be allowed for baghouse pressure drop creep above the design per-
formance level.
It is important to remember that the definition of fan static pressure generally used on fan perfor-
mance curves is not simply the difference in static pressure measured across the fan. One way to
define FSP is:
FSP = FTP 2 VPOUT
(10.4.1)
In equation 10.4.1, FTP is fan total pressure or system total pressure loss and VPOUT is velocity
pressure at the fan outlet.
Poor selection and maintenance of baghouses, which can lead to high baghouse pressure drop, can
restrict the flow achievable by the fan. A fan selected near the peak pressure output has no chance
of meeting the needs of such a system.

10.4.4.3 Baghouses
A variety of baghouse types and arrangements are available depending on the specific require-
ments of the particular emission control system. Net refers to the operating condition where one
compartment is off-line (such as during online cleaning or maintenance of a compartment). Key
baghouse design parameters by baghouse type are given here. 
Reverse air baghouses are economical for gas volumes greater than 5600 Nm3/min. (200,000
scfm).19 Operating at positive pressure, this design offers cost savings over negative pressure
designs. The maximum recommended air to cloth ratio is 2.0–2.5, net. Reverse air baghouses are
generally very large in size.
Shaker baghouses are generally similar in application as the reverse air design, but tend to require
more maintenance than reverse air designs due to more mechanical movement. It is difficult to
achieve the same level of gas cleaning as achieved by reverse air designs. The maximum recom-
mended air to cloth ratio is 1.5–2.0, net.19
Pulse jet baghouses are economical for gas volumes less than 5600 Nm3/min. (200,000 scfm), are
of modular construction and operate under negative pressure. The maximum recommended air to
cloth ratio is 4.0, net.19
These design parameters are general and are meant to be guidelines for baghouse selection.
Individual requirements must be determined on a site by site basis.
Reverse air baghouses can be both positive or negative pressure designs. Positive pressure bag-
houses are cheaper but use dirty-side fans. Dirty-side fan applications have been successfully
applied in many operations, but attention is required in impeller selection to minimize wear.
Negative pressure reverse air baghouses are more expensive than positive pressure baghouses
because they need to have air-tight construction to avoid leakage. This is generally not an issue
with positive pressure baghouses where the baghouse shell encloses the clean-side of the bags and
exhausts to atmosphere (only hoppers need to be gas-tight because they see the dirty gas). Also,
leakages in positive pressure systems are noticeable, while negative pressure system leakages are
not evident and frequently remain undetected. Resulting differences between inlet and outlet flows
as high as 15% have been measured.
Large pulse jet baghouses, due to the sheer number of valves and associated equipment, require
more maintenance. Their modular construction tends to make them economical for smaller volume
requirements (less than 5600 Nm3/min. or 200,000 scfm).
Insufficient baghouse capacity translates into insufficient cloth area in the baghouse. The type of
baghouse and cloth material used determines the maximum flow that can realistically be drawn
through the bag filter.
A common design consideration in all baghouses is that the hoppers should never be used for dust
storage. Hoppers should be continuously emptied. Allowing dust to build up in the hopper provides
an opportunity for dust re-entrainment, increasing the load on the bags, the propensity for fires and
potential for spark damage.
Bag damage can occur for a number of reasons including wear, direct impaction of particulate,
spark burn, hot flame burn, and high temperature operation. Wear can be a result of poor gas dis-
tribution causing bags to swing (for pulse jet baghouses with cage-mounted bags below the tube
sheet) or improper tensioning of bags allowing them to rub against each other or compartment
walls (for reverse air or shaker baghouses with spring-mounted bags above the tube sheet).
Direct impaction is related to dirty gas distribution, where particulate can follow a direct path from
the gas inlet to the bags. The way in which the dirty gas stream is introduced to the bags is a crit-
ical aspect of hopper design. Direct impaction of dirty gas on the bags can result in bag wear and
premature bag failure. One method of avoiding this problem is to design a high profile hopper with
a series of vertical baffle plates as illustrated in Fig. 10.57. This forces an extreme change in direc-

tion for the particulate causing it to lose its momentum before reaching the bags. This method of
dirty gas distribution can be achieved with minimal pressure drop.
Spark burns are normally associated with particulate still combusting as it reaches the baghouse.
Hopper baffle plates can help reduce this problem as it is normally associated with larger particu-
late. An adequately sized dropout box can also remove these large particulate from the gas stream
prior to the baghouse inlet.
Hot flame burn can occur when the duct length between the baghouse and canopy is relatively
short. Without major modifications to the system configuration, protection from fireballs reaching
the baghouse can be achieved using thermocouples tied in to control of emergency dilution
dampers.
High temperature operation for extended periods can gradually weaken bag fabric leading to pre-
mature failures.
10.4.4.4 Material Handling
Material handling in emission control systems is achieved with a variety of equipment types.
Pneumatic conveying systems can be either dense or dilute phase design. For EAF dust transport,
it is recommended to use dilute phase. The pneumatic lines should be a minimum 15 cm (6 in.)
diameter.19 Well designed systems can provide dependable service with minimal maintenance
requirements.
Air slide/air lift systems operate by fluidizing the dust to be conveyed. In the case of slides, the
equipment includes an enclosed chute mounted diagonally (minimum 7° slope) to allow the dust
to flow down the length of the slide as it is fluidized.19 The chute configuration increases the over-
all height of the baghouse. Air lifts incorporate low velocity vertical conveying of the collected par-
ticulate in a pipe over a fluidizing ejector. Such systems have low wear and low maintenance.
Mechanical conveyors can include any such types as screw conveyors, drag chain conveyors and
bucket elevators. It is important that these systems be adequately sized (both in terms of quantity
throughput and motor power) for surge conditions. Conveyors discharging from baghouse hoppers
should be capable of starting under full hopper conditions.

Mechanical conveying systems will often require dedusting exhaust capacity. In order to avoid
fugitive emissions (or in the case of negative pressure systems, in-leakage which robs capacity and
re-entrains dust) it is important for the equipment to be well sealed. Routine maintenance is essen-
tial for maintaining such systems in good working condition.
For convenient operation, storage silos should be sized for a minimum three day storage capacity.
This is so that material discharge can be carried out during day time shifts. It also allows the EAF
operation to continue over a long weekend without bringing in staff for dust disposal.
Typically dust control is required for clean operation of silos. This can be accomplished by either
an independent bin vent filter mounted on the silo, or a direct connection from the silo to the inlet
side of the baghouse (in the case of positive pressure baghouses this connection would be on the
inlet side of the fans). In either case, the silo is maintained under a negative pressure so that any
openings in the silo will see an infiltration of air rather than a puffing out of dust.
Silo dischargers are also candidates for dust control. One effective design is a telescopic discharge
which incorporates a concentric flexible discharge with exhaust applied to the outer section. The
source of exhaust can be either of the methods described for the silo itself.
10.4.5 Mechanisms of EAF Dust Formation
Currently about 600,000 tons of EAF dust are generated each year in the U.S. The amount of dust
generated is usually in the range of 9–18 kg (20–40 lbs) per ton of scrap melted. The reason for the
wide range is due to differences in scrap quality, operating practices, dust capture efficiency and
methods of introducing raw materials into the EAF. Currently the Center for Materials Production,
(a group sponsored by the Electrical Power Research Institute) is conducting a major study on the
mechanisms related to fume generation and hopes to be able to identify methods by which fume
generation may be reduced. Much of the previous work done in this field deals with dust and fume
generation in the BOF. However, as oxygen use in the EAF continues to rise, analogous mecha-
nisms can be expected. Some of the key fume generation mechanisms are expanded upon.
10.4.5.1 Entrainment of Particles
Entrainment of particles occurs as CaO, rust and dirt in the scrap are pulled out of the EAF in the
offgas system. It has been shown that the amount of CaO carryover is highly related to the method
by which it is fed to the EAF.
10.4.5.2 Volatilization Of Volatile Metals
Certain metals volatilize as the scrap heats up. These include Zn, Pb, Cd, Na, Mn and Fe. These
metals tend to form oxides following volatilization and show up as such in the EAF dust.
Obviously, one way of reducing the total amount of dust generated would be to ensure that these
materials were not included in the scrap charge. However, the recycle of coated scrap is on the
increase and as such this portion of the dust generation is likely to increase. The degree of
volatilization is likely related to hot spots in the furnace such as those under the arc and those
which occur in oxygen lancing and oxy-fuel burner operations.
10.4.5.3 CO Bubble Bursting
CO bubbles are generated during oxygen lancing and slag foaming operations. Some liquid steel
is usually associated with these bubbles and when they burst, this steel is ejected into the furnace
atmosphere where it forms very fine particles of iron oxide.
10.4.6 Future Environmental Concerns
With the increased focus on environmental concerns, the focus on meltshop fume control has
shifted to include not only particulate capture but also to control the emission of toxic gases from

the fume system. Several gases have been scrutinized over the past five years and in 1991, the EPA
revised its list of hazardous emissions to address control of emissions of these gases. Some of those
gases that are associated with electric furnace operations are CO/CO2, NOx, VOCs and dioxins. In
addition, emission standards for particulate matter continue to become more stringent. These issues
are discussed in detail in the following sections.
10.4.6.1 Comparison of Environmental Regulations
Over the past few years environmental regulations have been made much more stringent as the
public has become more aware of the hazards posed by various industrial emissions. In Europe the
regulations are even tougher than those proposed in North America. This is probably due to a
greater population density that results in industrial facilities frequently being located in heavily
populated areas. The European Community has recently adopted regulations that closely align to
the German Federal Air Emission Directive (17th BImSch V) of 1990. Table 10.10 shows the
German standards.
It is likely that North American standards will closely match these in the future.
10.4.6.2 Dust Emissions
Typically, electric furnace operations generate approximately 9–18 kg (20–40 lbs) of dust for every
ton of steel produced. The preferred method of capture appears to be via a fourth hole system feed-
ing to a baghouse for capture of the dust. Most modern systems claim discharge levels of 5–50
mg/m3 in the discharge gas. Of a greater concern in most meltshops is the level of fugitive dust
emissions to the shop environment. This can be addressed by several methods such as increasing
fourth hole extraction (though this can have a negative effect on productivity), increasing canopy
hood extraction (this is the most expensive option), and providing a furnace enclosure.
Of the three options, the latter appears to be gaining popularity because it results in a low volume
gas cleaning system without side effects on the process.
10.4.6.3 CO
CO and CO2 result from several operations in the EAF. When oxygen is lanced into the furnace it
reacts with carbon to produce CO. If substantial amounts of CO are not captured by the DES sys-
tem, ambient levels in the work environment may not be acceptable. Typically up to 10% of the CO
unburned in the furnace reports to the secondary fume capture system during meltdown.
CO and CO2 are of concern due to the fact that they are greenhouse gases and contribute to global
warming. As oxygen use has increased in the EAF, so have the quantities of CO and CO2 emitted
from furnace operations. CO generation has also increased considerably with the adoption of
foamy slag practices. Much of the CO generated within the EAF does not burn to CO2 until it is
within the fume system. This makes the fume system requirements greater due to the increased heat

load. In addition, the benefit of CO post-combustion as an energy source for steelmaking is not
utilized.
If however, the CO is burned in the freeboard it is possible to recover heat within the furnace thus
reducing the heat load that the offgas system must handle. Results are discussed in Section
10.7.5.1.
If greater energy efficiencies can be achieved in the furnace via post-combustion, the net effect is
to decrease the generation of CO2 considerably. The combustion of carbon to CO produces only
one-third of the energy of the combustion of CO. Thus even if only 50% of the energy available
from post-combustion of CO is transferred back to the bath, a reduction of oxygen lancing into the
bath of 50% could be made. By utilizing the energy from the post-combustion of CO, it will not
be necessary to lance as much carbon out of the bath. This will lead to reduced CO/CO2 emissions
as well as considerable cost savings.
Other factors which can reduce CO emissions have been identified and include:
1. Use a low velocity water-cooled elbow exit coupled with a high velocity water-
cooled duct inlet.
2. Ensure proper combustion air gap setting.
3. Provide accurate and reliable furnace draft control.
4. Provide sufficient DES capacity.
5. Ensure that carbon for slag foaming is injected at the bath/slag interface.
6. Melt as fast as possible.
7. Apply post-combustion to burn the CO in the furnace.
8. Begin oxygen lancing as early as possible—this spreads out CO generation through-
out the melting cycle and reduces the maximum heat load on the DES.
10.4.6.4 NOx
NOx is formed in furnace operations when nitrogen passes through the arc between electrodes.
Some thermal NOx is also generated from burner use in EAFs. Typical levels of NOx reported are
in the range of 36–90 g NOx per ton of steel.18 Thermal NOx can be addressed using any of the
conventional methods. Typically, thermal NOx is reduced by improving the burner design and pro-
viding good mixing of the pre-combustion gases. NOx resulting from nitrogen passing through the
arc can be reduced by reducing the amount of nitrogen available in the furnace. This can be
achieved by closing up furnace gaps and by closing the slag door whenever possible. Many oper-
ations lance oxygen through the door and as a result large a large volume of air enters the furnace.
This can be reduced by providing a shield close to the door or by hanging chains close to the open-
ing. Foamy slag practice can be beneficial since the slag foams up partially blocking the opening.
Also, since foamy slag helps to bury the arc, it is more difficult for nitrogen to pass through the arc
and be ionized.
Thermal NOx is also formed in the water-cooled duct following the combustion air gap as any com-
bustible materials burn with the oxygen which has entered the ductwork in the combustion air. If
all of the combustible material burns quickly, the gas temperature will reach a level where thermal
NOx is formed. One option which is now being investigated is to close up the combustion gap
somewhat and to supply combustion air at various points in the water-cooled duct downstream of
the combustion gap through injectors. Thus the combustion will be staged along the first two-thirds
of the water-cooled duct and will avoid the temperatures associated with thermal NOx generation.
10.4.6.5 VOCs
Most scrap mixes contain organic compounds to some extent. When scrap is charged to the fur-
nace, some of these organic compounds burn off contributing to the charging plume. In most cases
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

organic materials continue to burn off for five to ten minutes following charging. If there is insuf-
ficient oxygen available for combustion, these hydrocarbons will report to the offgas system where
they may or may not be combusted. The total emissions of hydrocarbons appears to be related to
the amount of chlorine in the EAF.20 Scrap preheating tends to produce greater emissions of hydro-
carbons because these do not burn due to the gas temperature range and as a result report to the
offgas system.
The best methods for reducing VOCs from EAF operations is to either destroy them or to limit the
amount entering the operation. If burners are operated with excess oxygen during the flash off
period it is possible to burn most of the organic compounds within the furnace. This is beneficial
because some of the heat is transferred back to the scrap thus aiding melting operations. It is also
beneficial in that the resulting heat load to the offgas is lower.
Some EAF operations try to limit the amount of oily scrap that is charged to the furnace. In some
cases the scrap is washed to remove some of the oil and grease. This is particularly true in the case
of turnings and borings. If the amount of organic material in the scrap is reduced the level of VOC
emissions is also reduced.
Some processes employ scrap preheating followed by an afterburner to destroy any VOCs. This
requires additional equipment and increases operating costs but ensures that emissions of VOCs
are kept to a minimum.
10.4.6.6 Dioxins
Dioxins and furans have become a major concern over the past few years in the incineration
process. Dioxins and furans are combustion byproducts and the prevention of these emissions
depends strongly on control of the combustion process. The term dioxins generally refers to 17 spe-
cific dioxin and furan congeners that are extremely toxic, the most toxic of which is tetra-
chloro–dibenzo–p–dioxin, see Fig. 10.58. These compounds are collectively referred to as dioxins
and regulations are specified as a tetrachloro–dibenzo–p–dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalent (TEQ).
It is only recently that dioxin emissions in steelmaking operations have been monitored in Europe.
Dioxins are cyclic hydrocarbons that are usually formed in combustion processes. Dioxins do not
have any known technical use and are not produced intentionally. They are formed as trace amounts
in some chemical processes and during combustion of fuels, especially materials containing chlo-
rinated materials. In incineration operations, dioxins are believed to form at a temperature of
approximately 500°C (932°F). Dioxins tend to be formed downstream of incineration operations
as the flue gases are cooled. This usually occurs in the temperature range of 250–400°C
(482°F–752°F) by reactions between oxygen, water, hydrochloric gas and products of incomplete
combustion.
In studies related to the formation of dioxins it was found that several factors had an affect. High
carbon and high chlorine concentrations favor dioxin formation. Carbon acts as a sorbent for pre-
cursor compounds for dioxin formation. Water vapor helps to inhibit chlorine and thus reduces
dioxin formation. Copper acts as a strong catalyst for dioxin formation. Al2O3 increases the effec-
tiveness of copper to catalyze the reaction. Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu along with their oxides help to cat-
alyze dioxin formation. Injection of ammonia into the offgas stream helps inhibit dioxin formation.
Activated carbon can be used to strip dioxins from the gas stream.

From the above information it is apparent that the components of the offgas stream in the EAF are
ideal for the formation of dioxins. In material published by MEFOS it was shown that the biggest
contributor to dioxins in scrap steel melting was PVC coated scrap followed by oily scrap.20 It was
also found that the baghouse emissions of dioxins ranged from 20–60% of the offgas stream con-
centration. This indicates that dioxins were being captured in the baghouse. This is supported by
research that indicates that 20–30% of dioxins are bound to particulate.21 The Swedish paper con-
cludes that the following factors can reduce dioxin emissions:  scrap sorting, scrap pretreatment,
post-combustion of organics in the furnace, and absorbent injection in the offgas.20
Tests conducted at several European steelmakers have indicated that dioxin formation can be con-
trolled by rapid quenching of the offgas through the temperature zone in which dioxin formation
usually takes place. In these operations offgas is cooled rapidly from approximately 800°C
(1470°F) to less than 300°C (570°F) using spray water. This has been shown to limit the dioxin
emissions to 0.1–0.2 ng/Nm3 TEQ. For most DES systems this would involve spray cooling of the
offgas following the water-cooled duct portion of the system. This should not pose problems for
system operation as long as the amount of spray cooling does not create dewpoint problems in the
baghouse.
10.4.7 Conclusions
Electric arc furnace fume systems have evolved considerably from very simple systems aimed at
improving the ambient work environment around the furnace to sophisticated systems aimed at
controlling not only the emission of particulate but also the control of toxic gases. Modern fume
systems are now designed to minimize the formation of toxic gases and to ensure that others are
destroyed before exiting the system. Thus gas cleaning in the modern day fume system entails
much more than trapping and collection of particulate matter. With the tighter environmental
restrictions expected in the future, it is expected that electric furnace operations will have to look
at environmental concerns in conjunction with furnace operations. A variety of factors will affect
the costs and processes necessary to maintain production and meet environmental restrictions.
Without doubt the cheapest method of meeting emissions restrictions is to prevent these com-
pounds from being present in the first place. Capture and treatment of pollutants is an expensive
way of dealing with the problem. Of course, tighter restrictions of the feed materials to the furnace
will also have an affect on productivity and operating costs. It will become necessary to weigh
environmental considerations with operations concerns in order to find an optimum that allows for
low cost steel production while meeting emissions requirements. This means that we must integrate
environmental thinking into operations in order to arrive at a low cost, environmentally friendly
steel production.
10.5 Raw Materials
The main raw material for EAF steelmaking is steel scrap. Scrap is an energy intensive and valu-
able commodity and comes primarily from three main sources: reclaimed scrap (also known as
obsolete scrap) which is obtained from old cars, demolished buildings, discarded machinery and
domestic objects; industrial scrap (also known as prompt scrap ) which is generated by industries
using steel within their manufacturing processes; and revert scrap (also known as home scrap)
which is generated within the steelmaking and forming processes (e.g. crop ends from rolling oper-
ations, metallic losses in slag etc.).
The latter two forms of scrap tend to be clean, i.e. they are close in chemical composition to the
desired molten steel composition and thus are ideal for recycle. Reclaimed/obsolete scrap fre-
quently has a quite variable composition and quite often contains contaminants that are undesirable
for steelmaking. Levels of residual elements such as Cu, Sn, Ni, Cr, and Mo are high in obsolete
scrap and can affect casting operations and product quality if they are not diluted. Thus a facility
which has a need for very low residual levels in the steel will be forced to use higher quality prompt
scrap but at a much higher cost. The alternative is to use a combination of the contaminated obso-

lete scrap along with what are generally referred to as clean iron units or virgin iron units. These
are materials which contain little or no residual elements. Clean iron units are typically in the form
of direct reduced iron (DRI), hot briquetted iron (HBI), iron carbide, pig iron, and molten pig iron
(hot metal).
It is possible to use lower grade scrap which contains residual elements, if this scrap is blended
with clean iron units so that the resulting residual levels in the steel following melting meet the
requirements for flat rolled products.
Obsolete scrap is much more readily available than prompt scrap and thus the use of clean iron
units is expected to increase as shortages of prompt scrap continue to grow.
In addition to classification of scrap into the above three groups, scrap is also classified based on
its physical size, its source and the way in which it is prepared. For example the following cate-
gories are those commonly used in North America: No. 1 bundles, No. 1 factory bundles, No. 1
shredded, No. 1 heavy melt, No. 2 heavy melt, No. 2 bundles, No. 2 shredded, busheling, turnings,
shredded auto, structural/plate 3 ft., structural/plate 5 ft., rail crops, and rail wheels.
In addition to the residual elements contained in the scrap, there are also several other undesirable
components including, oil, grease, paint coatings, zinc coatings, water, oxidized material and dirt.
The lower the grade of scrap, the more likely it is to contain greater quantities of these materials.
As a result this scrap may sell at a discount but the yield of liquid steel may be considerably lower
than that obtained when using a higher grade scrap. In addition, these undesirable components may
result in higher energy requirements and environmental problems. Thus the decision for scrap mix
to be used within a particular operation will frequently depend on several factors including avail-
ability, scrap cost, melting cost, yield, and the effect on operations (based on scrap density, oil and
grease content, etc.).
In practice, most operations buy several different types of scrap and blend them to yield the most
desirable effects for EAF operations.
10.6 Fluxes and Additives
Carbon is essential to the manufacture of steel. Carbon is one of the key elements which give var-
ious steel grades their properties. Carbon is also important in steelmaking refining operations and
can contribute a sizable quantity of the energy required in steelmaking operations. In BOF steel-
making, carbon is present in the hot metal that is produced in the blast furnace. In electric furnace
steelmaking, some carbon will be contained in the scrap feed, in DRI, HBI or other alternative iron
furnace feeds. The amount of carbon contained in these EAF feeds will generally be considerably
lower than that contained in hot metal and typically, some additional carbon is charged to the EAF.
In the past carbon was charged to the furnace to ensure that the melt-in carbon level was above that
desired in the final product. As higher oxygen utilization has developed as standard EAF practice,
more carbon is required in EAF operations. The reaction of carbon with oxygen within the bath to
produce carbon monoxide results in a significant energy input to the process and has lead to sub-
stantial reductions in electrical power consumption in EAF operations. The generation of CO
within the bath is also key to achieving low concentrations of dissolved gases (nitrogen and hydro-
gen) in the steel as these are flushed out with the carbon monoxide. In addition, oxide inclusions
are flushed from the steel into the slag.
In oxygen injection operations, some iron is oxidized and reports to the slag. Oxy-fuel burner oper-
ations will also result in some scrap oxidation and this too will report to the slag once the scrap
melts in. Dissolved carbon in the steel will react with FeO at the slag/bath interface to produce CO
and recover iron units to the bath.
The amount of charge carbon used will be dependent on several factors including carbon content
of scrap feed, projected oxygen consumption, desired tap carbon, and the economics of iron yield

595

versus carbon cost. In general, the amount used will correspond to a carbon/oxygen balance as the
steelmaker will try to maximize the iron yield. Typical charge carbon rates for medium carbon steel
production lie in the range of 2–12 kg per ton of liquid steel.
Generally, the three types of carbonaceous material used as charge carbon in EAF operations are
anthracite coal, metallurgical coke and green petroleum coke. Most anthracite coal used in North
American steelmaking operations is mined in eastern Pennsylvania. This material has a general
composition of 3–8% moisture content, 11–18% ash content and 0.4–0.7% sulfur.
The high variation in ash content translates into wide variations in fixed carbon content and in gen-
eral, EAF operations strive to keep ash content to a minimum. The ash consists primarily of silica.
Thus increased ash input to the EAF will require additional lime addition in order to maintain the
desired V-ratio in the slag. The best grades of anthracite coal have fixed carbon contents of
87–89%. Low grade anthracite coals may have fixed carbon levels as low as 50%.
Anthracite coal is available in a wide variety of sizes ranging from 4 3 8 in. down to 3/64 in. 3
100 mesh. The most popular sizes for use as charge carbon are nut (1 5/8 3 13/16 in.), pea (13/16
3 9/16 in.), and buckwheat (9/16 3 5/16 in.).
Metallurgical coke is produced primarily in integrated steel operations and is used in the blast fur-
nace. However, some coke is used as EAF charge carbon. Generally, this material has a composi-
tion of 1–2% moisture content, 1–3.5% volatile material, 86–88% fixed carbon, 9–12% ash content
and 0.88–1.2% sulfur.
Usually coke breeze with a size of –1/2 3 0 is used as charge carbon. Coarser material can be used
but is more expensive.
Green petroleum coke is a byproduct of crude oil processing. Its properties and composition vary
considerably and are dependent on the crude oil feedstock from which it is derived. Several cok-
ing processes are used in commercial operation and these will produce considerably different types
of coke.
Sponge coke results from delayed coker operations and is porous in nature. It may be used as a fuel
or may be processed into electrodes or anodes depending on sulfur content and impurity levels.
This material is sometimes available as charge carbon.
Needle coke is produced using a special application of the delayed coker process. It is made from
high grade feedstocks and is the prime ingredient for the production of carbon and graphite elec-
trodes. This material is generally too expensive to be used as charge carbon.
Shot coke is a hard, pebble-like material resulting from delayed coker operation under conditions
which minimize coke byproduct generation. It is generally used as a fuel and is cost competitive
as charge carbon.
Fluid coke is produced in a fluid coker by spraying the residue onto hot coke particles. It is usu-
ally high in sulfur content and is used in anode baking furnaces. It can also be used as a recarbur-
izer if it is calcined.
Over the past decade, many operations have adopted foamy slag practices. At the start of meltdown
the radiation from the arc to the sidewalls is negligible while the electrodes are surrounded by the
scrap. As melting proceeds the efficiency of heat transfer to the scrap and bath drops off and more
heat is radiated from the arc to the sidewalls. By covering the arc in a layer of slag, the arc is
shielded and the energy is transferred to the bath. Oxygen is injected with coal to foam the slag by
producing CO gas in the slag. In some cases only carbon is injected and the carbon reacts with FeO
in the slag to produce CO gas. When foamed, the slag cover increases from 10 to 30 cm thick.22 In
some cases the slag is foamed to such an extent that it comes out of the electrode ports. Claims for
the increase in energy transfer efficiency range from an efficiency of 60–90% with slag foaming
compared to 40% without.23,24 It has been reported that at least 0.3% carbon should be removed
from the bath using oxygen in order to achieve a good foamy slag practice.25
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

The effectiveness of slag foaming is dependent on several process parameters as described in the
section on furnace technologies. Typical carbon injection rates for slag foaming are 2–5 kg per ton
of liquid steel for low to medium powered furnaces. Higher powered furnaces and DC furnaces will
tend to use 5–10 kg of carbon per ton liquid steel. This is due to the fact that the arc length is much
greater than low powered AC operations and therefore greater slag cover is required to bury the arc.
Lime is the most common flux used in modern EAF operations. Most operations now use basic
refractories and as a result, the steelmaker must maintain a basic slag in the furnace in order to min-
imize refractory consumption. Slag basicity has also been shown to have a major effect on slag
foaming capabilities. Thus lime tends to be added both in the charge and also via injection directly
into the furnace. Lime addition practices can vary greatly due to variances in scrap composition.
As elements in the bath are oxidized (e.g. P, Al, Si, Mn) they contribute acidic components to the
slag. Thus basic slag components must be added to offset these acidic contributions. If silica lev-
els in the slag are allowed to get too high, significant refractory erosion will result. In addition, FeO
levels in the slag will increase because FeO has greater solubility in higher silica slags. This can
lead to higher yield losses in the EAF.
The generation of slag also allows these materials which have been stripped from the bath to be
removed from the steel by pouring slag out of the furnace through the slag door which is located
at the back of the EAF. This is known as slagging off. If the slag is not removed but is instead
allowed to carry over to the ladle it is possible for slag reversion to take place. This occurs when
metallic oxides are reduced out of the slag by a more reactive metallic present in the steel. When
steel is tapped it is frequently killed by adding either silicon of aluminum during tapping. The pur-
pose of these additions is to lower the oxygen content in the steel. If however P2O5 is carried over
into the ladle, it is possible that it will react with the alloy additions producing silica or alumina
and phosphorus which will go back into solution in the steel.
Sometimes magnesium lime is added to the furnace either purely as MgO or as a mixture of MgO
and CaO. Basic refractories are predominantly MgO, thus by adding a small amount of MgO to the
furnace, the slag can quickly become saturated with MgO and thus less refractory erosion is likely
to take place.
10.7 Electric Furnace Technology
The electric arc furnace has evolved considerably over the past 20 years. Gone are the days when
electric power was the only source of energy for scrap melting. Previously tap-to-tap times in the
range of 3–8 hours were common.26 With advances in technology it is now possible to make heats
in under one hour with electrical energy consumptions in the range of 380–400 kWh/ton.23 The
electric furnace has evolved into a fast and low cost melter of scrap where the major criterion is
higher productivity in order to reduce fixed costs. Innovations which helped to achieve the higher
production rates include oxy-fuel burners, oxygen lancing, carbon/lime injection, foamy slag prac-
tices, post-combustion in the EAF freeboard, EAF bath stirring, modified electrical supply (series
reactors etc.), current conducting electrode arms, DC furnace technology and other innovative
process technologies (scrap preheat, continuous charging etc.).
10.7.1 Oxygen Use in the EAF
Much of the productivity gain achieved over the past 10–15 years was related to oxygen use in the
furnace. Exothermic reactions were used to replace a substantial portion of the energy input in the
EAF. Whereas oxygen utilization of 9 Nm3/ton (300 scf/ton) was considered ordinary just 10 years
ago, some operations now use as much as 40 Nm3/ton (1300 scf/ton) for lancing operations.27,28
With post-combustion, rates as high as 70 Nm3/ton (2500 scf/ton) have been implemented. It is
now common for 30–40% of the total energy input to the EAF to come from oxy-fuel burners and
oxygen lancing.23,28 By the early 1980s, more than 80% of the EAFs in Japan employed oxy-fuel

burners.23 In North America it was estimated that in 1990, only 24% of EAF operations were using
such burners.29 Since that time, a large percentage of North American operations have looked to
the use of increased oxygen levels in their furnaces in order to increase productivity and decrease
electrical energy consumption. High levels of oxygen input are standard on most new EAF instal-
lations.
The IISI 1990 electric arc furnace report indicates that most advanced EAF operations utilize at
least 22 Nm3/ton (770 scf/ton) of oxygen.18 In addition oxygen supplies 20–32% of the total power
input in conventional furnace operations. This has grown with the use of alternative iron sources
in the EAF, many of which contain elevated carbon contents (1–3%). In some cases, electrical
energy now accounts for less than 50% of the total power input for steelmaking.
One of the best examples of the progressive increase in oxygen use within the EAF is the meltshop
operation at Badische Stahlwerke (BSW). Between 1978 and 1990, oxygen use was increased from
9 Nm3/ton to almost 27 Nm3/ton. Productivity increased from 32 ton per hour to 85 ton per hour
while power consumption decreased from 494 kWh/ton to 357 kWh/ton.30 During this period,
BSW developed their own manipulator for the automatic injection of oxygen and carbon. In 1993,
BSW installed the ALARC post-combustion system developed by Air Liquide and increased oxy-
gen consumption in the furnace to 41.5 Nm3/ton. The corresponding power consumption is 315
kWh/ton with a tap-to-tap time of 48 minutes. This operation has truly been one of the pioneers for
increased chemical energy use in the EAF.
10.7.2 Oxy-Fuel Burner Application in the EAF
Oxy-fuel burners are now almost standard equipment on electric arc furnaces in many parts of the
world. The first use of burners was for melting the scrap at the slag door where arc heating was
fairly inefficient. As furnace power was increased, burners were installed to help melt at the cold
spots common to UHP operation. This resulted in more uniform melting and decreased the melt-
ing time necessary to reach a flat bath. It was quickly realized that productivity increases could be
achieved by installing more burner power. Typical productivity increases reported in the literature
have been in the range of 5–20%.22,31–33 In recent years oxy-fuel burners have been of greater
interest due to the increase in the cost of electrodes and electricity. Thus natural gas potentially pro-
vides a cheaper source of energy for melting. Fig. 10.59 shows oxy-fuel burners in operation in an
EAF.

Fig. 10.59 Oxy-fuel burners in EAF oper-
ations.

Typically burners are located in either the slag door, sidewall or roof. Slag door burners are gener-
ally used for small to medium sized furnaces where a single burner can reach all of the cold
spots.22,33 Door burners have the advantage that they can be removed when not in use. For larger
furnaces, three or four sidewall mounted burners are more effective for cold spot penetration.
However these are vulnerable to attack from slag, especially if employing a foamy slag practice. In
such cases the burners are sometimes mounted in the roof and are fired tangentially through the
furnace cold spots.
Oxy-fuel burners aid in scrap melting by transferring heat to the scrap. This heat transfer takes
place via three modes; either forced convection from the combustion products, radiation from the
combustion products or conduction from carbon or metal oxidation and from scrap to other
scrap.33
Primarily heat transfer is via the first two modes except when the burners are operated with excess
oxygen. Heat transfer by these two modes is highly dependent on the temperature difference
between the scrap and the flame and on the surface area of the scrap exposed for heat transfer. As
a result oxy-fuel burners are most efficient at the start of a melt-in period when the scrap is cold.
As melting proceeds the efficiency will drop off as the scrap surface in contact with the flame
decreases and due to the fact that the scrap temperature also increases. It is generally recommended
that burners be discontinued after 50% of the meltdown period is completed so that reasonable effi-
ciencies are achieved.23 An added complication is that once the scrap heats up it is possible for iron
to react with the water formed by combustion to produce iron oxide and hydrogen. This results in
yield loss and the hydrogen must be combusted downstream in the offgas system. Usually the point
at which burner use should be discontinued is marked by a rise in offgas temperature(indicating
that more heat is being retained in the offgas).33 In some operations the temperature of the furnace
side panels adjacent to the burner is used to track burner efficiency. Once the efficiency drops
below a set point the burners are shut off.29
Heat transfer by conduction occurs when excess oxygen reacts with material in the charge. This
will result in lower yield if the material burned is iron or alloys and as a result is not generally rec-
ommended. However in the period immediately following charging when volatile and combustible
materials in the scrap flash off, additional oxygen in the furnace is beneficial as it allows this mate-
rial to be burned inside the furnace and thus results in heat transfer back to the scrap. This is also
beneficial for the operation of the offgas system as it not required to remove this heat downstream.
Fig. 10.60 indicates that 0.133 MW of burner rating should be supplied per ton of furnace capac-
ity.34 Other references recommend a minimum of 30 kWh/ton of burner power to eliminate cold
spots in a UHP furnace and 55–90 kWh/ton of burner power for low powered furnaces.23
A burner/lance has been developed by Empco, Fig. 10.15, that has the capability of following the
scrap level as it melts. The lance is similar to a BOF design (water-cooled) and is capable of oper-
ation at various oxygen to natural gas ratios or with oxygen alone for decarburization. The lance is
banana shaped and follows the scrap as its melts back. Thus a high heat transfer efficiency can be
maintained for a longer period of time. Typical efficiencies reported for the Unilance are in the
range of 65–70%.35
Heat transfer efficiencies reported in the literature vary greatly in the range of 50–75%.24 Data
published by L’Air Liquide shows efficiencies of 64–80% based on energy savings. Krupp indi-
cates an energy efficiency based on energy savings alone of 78%,36 and also gives an indication of
why such high efficiencies are reported when looking at energy replacement alone. According to
Krupp, an increase of one minute in meltdown time corresponds to an increase in power con-
sumption of 2 kWh/ton. Thus the decrease in tap-to-tap time must be taken into account when cal-
culating burner efficiency. For typically reported energy efficiencies, once this is taken into
account burner efficiencies lie in the range of 45–65% in all cases. This is supported somewhat by
theoretical calculations by Danieli that indicated that only 20–30% of the energy from the burners
went to the scrap;37 as much as 40–60% of the heat went to the offgas and the remainder was lost
to the water-cooled furnace panels.

Fig. 10.61 shows burner efficiency as a function of operating time based on actual furnace offgas
measurements.34 This shows that burner efficiency drops off rapidly after 40–50% of the melting
time. By 60% into the melting time burner efficiency has dropped off to below 30%. It is apparent
that a cumulative efficiency of 50–60% is achieved over the first half of the meltdown period and
drops off rapidly afterwards. As a result, typical operating practice for a three bucket charge is to
run the burners for two-thirds of the first meltdown, one-half of the second meltdown and one-third
of the third meltdown. For operations with only one backcharge, burners are typically run for 50%
of each meltdown phase.32
The amount of power input to the furnace has a small effect on the increase in heatload and offgas
volume. The major factor is the rate at which the power is put into the furnace. Thus for a low pow-

ered furnace(high tap-to-tap time), the total burner input to the EAF may be in the range of 80–100
kWh/ton but the net effect on the offgas evacuation requirements may not change much as the
burners are run for a longer period of time. Likewise for a high powered furnace, due to the short
tap-to-tap time, the burner input rate may be quite high even though the burners supply only 30
kWh/Ton to the furnace.
Bender estimates that offgas flowrates can increase by a factor of 1.5 and offgas heatload by as high
as a factor of 2.5 for operation with burners and high oxygen lance rates.37
10.7.3 Application of Oxygen Lancing in the EAF
Over the past ten years oxygen lancing has become an integral part of EAF melting operations. It
has been recognized in the past that productivity improvements in the open hearth furnace and in
the BOF were possible through the use of oxygen to supply fuel for exothermic reactions. Whereas
previously oxygen was used primarily only for decarburization in the EAF at levels of 3–8 Nm3 per
ton (96–250 scf/ton),23,32 in modern operations anywhere from 10–30% of the total energy input
is supplied via exothermic bath reactions.23,24,28,38,29 For a typical UHP furnace oxygen con-
sumption is in the range of 18–27 Nm3/ton (640–960 scf/ton).28 Oxygen utilization in the EAF is
much higher in Japan and in Europe where electricity costs are higher. Oxygen injection can pro-
vide a substantial power input—a lance rate of 30 Nm3/min. (1050 scfm)is equivalent to a power
input of 11 MW based on the theoretical reaction heat from combustion of C to CO.23
Oxygen lances can be of two forms. Water-cooled lances are generally used for decarburization
though in some cases they are now use for scrap cutting as well. The conventional water-cooled
lance was mounted on a platform and penetrated into the side of the furnace through a panel.
Water-cooled lances do not actually penetrate the bath though they sometimes penetrate into the
slag layer. Consumable lances are designed to penetrate into the bath or the slag layer. They con-
sist of consumable pipe which is adjusted as it burns away to give sufficient working length. The
first consumable lances were operated manually through the slag door. Badische Stahl Engineering
developed a robotic manipulator to automate the process. This manipulator is used to control two
lances automatically.22 Various other manipulators have been developed recently and now have the
capability to inject carbon and lime for slag foaming simultaneously with oxygen lancing. One
major disadvantage of lancing through the slag door is that it can increase air infiltration into the
furnace by 100–200%. This not only has a negative impact on furnace productivity but also
increases offgas system evacuation requirements substantially. As a result, not all of the fume is
captured and a significant amount escapes from the furnace to the shop. This can be a significant
problem if substantial quantities of CO escape to the shop due to its rapid cooling and subsequent
incomplete combustion to CO2. Thus background levels of CO in the work environment may
become an issue. To reduce the amount of air infiltration to the EAF, some operations insert the
lance through the furnace sidewall as shown in Fig. 10.62.
Energy savings due to oxygen lancing arise from both exothermic reactions (oxidation of carbon
and iron) and due to stirring of the bath with leads to temperature and composition homogeneity
of the bath. The product of scrap cutting is liquid iron and iron oxide. Thus most of the heat is
retained in the bath. The theoretical energy input for oxygen reactions in the bath is as follows23:
Fe + 1/2 O2 n FeO,  heat input 5 6.0 kWh/Nm3 O2
(10.7.1)
C + 1/2 O2 n CO,  heat input 5 2.8 kWh/Nm3 O2
(10.7.2)
Thus it is apparent that much more energy is available if iron is burned to produce FeO. Naturally
though, this will impact negatively on productivity. Studies have shown that the optimum use of
oxygen for conventional lancing operations is in the range of 30–40 Nm3/ton (1000–1250
scf/ton).27 Above this level yield losses are excessive and it is no longer economical to add oxy-
gen. Typical operating results have given energy replacement values for oxygen in the range of 2–4
kWh/Nm3 O2 (0.056–0.125 kWh/scf O2), with an average of 3.5 kWh/Nm3 O2 (0.1 kWh/scf
O2).24,27,28,31,32,32,40,41 These values show that it is likely that both carbon and iron are reacting. In

addition, some studies have shown that the oxygen yield (i.e. the amount reacting with carbon) is
in the range of 70–80%.34,41 This would support the theory that both carbon and iron are reacting.
During scrap cutting operations, the oxygen reacts primarily with the iron. Later when a molten
pool has formed the FeO is reduced out of the slag by carbon in the bath. Thus the net effect is to
produce CO gas from the oxygen that is lanced.
Based on the information cited in the preceding section, it can be expected that for every Nm3 of
oxygen lanced, 0.75 Nm3 will react with carbon to produce 1.5 Nm3 of CO (based on the average

energy replacement value of 3.5 kWh/ Nm3 O2). If in addition the stirring effect of the lancing
brings bath carbon or injected carbon into contact with FeO in the slag, an even greater quantity of
CO may result. That this occurs is supported by data that indicates a decarburization efficiency of
greater than 100%. Thus during the decarburization period up to 2.5 Nm3 of CO may result for
every Nm3 of oxygen injected. Typical oxygen rates are in the range of 30–100 Nm3/min.
(1000–3500 scfm) and are usually limited by the ability of the fourth hole system to evacuate the
furnace fume. Recommended lance rates for various furnace sizes are shown in Fig. 10.63 and indi-
cate a rate of approximately 0.78–0.85 Nm3/ton (25–30 scfm/ton) of furnace capacity. In some
newer processes where feed materials are very high in carbon content, oxygen lance rates equiva-
lent to 0.1% decarburization per minute are required. In such cases, the lance rates may be as high
as 280 Nm3/min (10,000 scfm) which is similar to BOF lance rates.
The major drawback to high oxygen lance rates is the effect on fume system control and the pro-
duction of NOx. Offgas volumes are greatly increased and the amount of CO generated is much
greater. This must be taken into account when contemplating increased oxygen use.
The use of oxygen lancing throughout the heat can be achieved in operations using a hot heel in
the furnace. Oxygen is lanced at a lower rate throughout the heat to foam the slag. This gives bet-
ter shielding of the arc leading to better electrical efficiency. It also gives lower peak flowrates of
CO to the offgas system, thus it reduces the extraction requirement of the offgas system.
High generation rates of CO may necessitate a post-combustion chamber in the DES system. If
substantial amounts of CO are not captured by the DES system, ambient levels in the work envi-
ronment may not be acceptable. Typically up to 10% of the CO unburned in the furnace reports to
the secondary fume capture system during meltdown.
Operating with the slag door open increases the overall offgas evacuation requirements sub-
stantially. If possible oxygen lances should penetrate the furnace higher up in the shell. Another
factor to consider is that the increased amount of nitrogen in the furnace will likely lead to
increased NOx.

10.7.4 Foamy Slag Practice
In recent years more EAF operations have begun to use a foamy slag practice. Foamy slag was ini-
tially associated with DRI melting operations where FeO and carbon from the DRI would react in
the bath to produce CO which would foam the slag. At the start of meltdown the radiation from the
arc to the sidewalls is negligible because the electrodes are surrounded by the scrap. As melting
proceeds the efficiency of heat transfer to the scrap and bath drops off and more heat is radiated
from the arc to the sidewalls. By covering the arc in a layer of slag, the arc is shielded and the
energy is transferred to the bath as shown in Fig. 10.64.
Oxygen is injected with coal to foam up the slag by producing CO gas in the slag. In some cases
only carbon is injected and the carbon reacts with FeO in the slag to produce CO gas. When
foamed, the slag cover increases from four inches thick to twelve inches.22 In some cases the slag
is foamed to such an extent that it comes out of the electrode ports.42 Claims for the increase in
efficiency range from an efficiency of 60–90% with slag foaming compared to 40% without.23,24
This is shown in Fig. 10.65 and Fig. 10.66. It has been reported that at least 0.3% carbon should
be removed using oxygen in order to achieve a good foamy slag practice.25 If a deep foamy slag is
achieved it is possible to increase the arc voltage considerably. This allows a greater rate of power
input. Slag foaming is usually carried out once a flat bath is achieved. However, with hot heel oper-
ations it is possible to start slag foaming much sooner.
Some of the benefits attributed to foamy slag are decreased heat losses to the sidewalls, improved
heat transfer from the arcs to the steel allows for higher rate of power input, reduced power and
voltage fluctuations, reduced electrical and audible noise, increased arc length (up to 100%) with-
out increasing heat loss and reduced electrode and refractory consumption.4,18,24
Several factors have been identified that promote slag foaming. These are oxygen and carbon avail-
ability, increased slag viscosity, decreased surface tension, slag basicity > 2.5 and FeO in slag at
15–20% to sustain the reaction.4,25,43 Fig. 10.67 and Fig. 10.68 show several of these effects graph-
ically.
The only negative side of foamy slag practice is that a large quantity of CO is produced in the EAF.
Bender estimates that offgas flowrates can increase by a factor of 1.5 and offgas heatload by as
much as a factor of 2.5 for high slag foaming rates.37 In many operations, a large amount of car-
bon is removed from the bath in order to generate chemical energy input for the operation. If this
CO is to be generated anyway, the operator is well advised to ensure that slag conditions are such
that foaming will result in order to benefit from the CO generation.

10.7.5 CO Post-Combustion
The 1990s have seen steelmakers advance further in lowering production costs of liquid steel.
Higher electrical input rates and increased oxygen and natural gas consumption has led to short
tap-to-tap times and high throughputs. Thus, energy losses are minimized and up to 60% of the
total power input ends up in the steel. This has not come without cost, as water-cooled panels and
roofs are required to operate at higher heat fluxes. Typically 8–10% of the power input is lost to the
cooling water and offgas temperatures are extremely high, with losses of approximately 20% of 
the power input to the offgas. As EAF steelmakers attempt to lower their energy inputs further 
they have begun to consider the heat contained in the offgas. One way in which this can be 
recaptured is to use the offgas to preheat scrap. This results in recovery of the sensible heat but 
does not address the calorific heat which can represent as much as 50–60% of the energy in the
offgas.

10.7.5.1 Introduction
Generically, post-combustion refers to the burning of any partially combusted compounds. In EAF
operations both CO and H 2 are present. CO gas is produced in large quantities in the EAF both
from oxygen lancing and slag foaming activities and from the use of pig iron or DRI in the charge.
Large amounts of CO and H2 are generated at the start of meltdown as oil, grease and other com-
bustible materials evolve from the surface of the scrap. If there is sufficient oxygen present, these
compounds will burn to completion. In most cases there is insufficient oxygen for complete com-
bustion and high levels of CO result. Tests conducted at Vallourec by Air Liquide showed that the
offgas from the furnace could contain considerable amounts of non-combusted CO when there was
insufficient oxygen present.44
The heat of combustion of CO to CO2 is three times greater than that of C to CO (for dissolved
carbon in the bath). This represents a very large potential energy source for the EAF. Studies at
Irsid (Usinor SA) have shown that the potential energy saving is significant and could be a much
as 72 kWh/ton.45 If the CO is burned in the freeboard it is possible to recover heat within the fur-
nace. Some of the expected benefits and concerns regarding post-combustion are given in Table
10.11. As more oxygen is used to reduce electrical consumption, there will be greater need for
improved oxygen utilization. In addition, environmental regulations may limit CO2 emissions. As
a result it will be necessary to obtain the maximum benefit of oxygen in the furnace. This can only
be achieved if most CO is burned in the furnace.

10.7.5.2 Post-Combustion in Electric Arc Furnaces
Several trials have been run using post-combustion in the EAF. In some of the current processes,
oxygen is injected into the furnace above the slag to post-combust CO. Some processes involve
injection of oxygen into the slag to post-combust the CO before it enters the furnace freeboard.
Most of these trials were inspired by an offgas analysis which showed large quantities of CO leav-
ing the EAF. Fig. 10.69 shows a typical post-combustion system where oxygen is added in the free-
board of the furnace. Thus combustion products directly contact the cold scrap. Most of the heat
transfer in this case is radiative. Fig. 10.70 shows the approach where post-combustion is carried
out low in the furnace or in the slag itself. Heat transfer is accomplished via the circulation of slag
and metal droplets within the slag. Post-combustion oxygen is introduced at very low velocities
into the slag. Heat transfer is predominantly convective for this mode of post-combustion. Some
other systems have incorporated bottom blown oxygen (via tuyeres in the furnace hearth) along
with injection of oxygen low in the furnace. In fact the first two processes to employ extensive
post-combustion as part of the operation (K-ES, EOF) both took this approach. These processes
are discussed in detail in Section 10.9 on future developments.
Some of the results that have been obtained are summarized in Table 10.12 along with their theo-
retical limits. Note that in many cases the energy savings has been stated in kWh/Nm3 of post-
combustion oxygen added. The theoretical limit for post-combustion of CO at bath temperatures
(1600°C) is 5.8 kWh/Nm3 of oxygen. PCRs have been calculated based on the offgas analysis pre-
sented in these references. HTE is rarely measured in EAF post-combustion trials and is generally
backed out based on electrical energy replacement due to post-combustion. This does not neces-
sarily represent the true post-combustion HTE because the oxygen can react with compounds other
than CO.

10.7.5.3 Theoretical Analysis of Post-Combustion
Due to the scatter of reported results to date for EAF post-combustion it is necessary to discuss the
theoretical analysis to put the results into perspective. In addition, the trials in converters and
smelters can help to draw conclusions.
10.7.5.3.1 Post-Combustion and Heat Transfer Mechanisms
Heat transfer to a mass of solid scrap is rel-
atively efficient due to its large surface area and the inherent large difference in temperature.
However, heat transfer to the bath is more difficult and two methods are proposed. Interaction of
metal and slag droplets occurs in the Hismelt process while heat transfer is through the slag phase
in deep slag (DIOS and AISI) processes. In bath smelting, post-combustion energy is consumed
and is not transferred to the bath. Exact mechanisms are not known at this time.
10.7.5.3.1.1 Post-Combustion in the Furnace Freeboard
All of the post-combustion results indicate that
high efficiency can only be achieved by effectively transferring the heat from the post-combustion
products to some other material. This has been verified in several BOF post-combustion trials
where scrap additions during post-combustion resulted in higher post-combustion levels.64,65 If the
combustion products do not transfer their heat, they will tend to dissociate. The best opportunity
during scrap melting is to transfer the heat to cold scrap. The adiabatic flame temperature for the
combustion of CO with oxygen levels off at 2800°C.66 The adiabatic flame temperature does not
increase proportionally to the amount of CO burned. Thus the amount of heat transferred from the
flame does not increase proportionally.66 The adiabatic flame temperature for oxygen/natural gas
combustion is in the range of 2600–2700°C.67,68 Natural gas combustion produces a greater vol-
ume per unit oxygen and therefore more contact with the scrap should occur. Trials with oxy-fuel
and oxy-coal burners indicate that efficiencies of 75–80% can be obtained at the start of meltdown,
but that efficiency drops off quickly as the scrap heats and an average efficiency of 65% can be

expected.34,69 For post-combustion, the efficiency can be expected to be similar or lower, depend-
ing on how long the process is carried out. Burner efficiency over a flat bath is 20 to 30%, setting
a lower limit and as a result, heat flux to the furnace panels will increase. Air Liquide has reported
PCR = 70% and HTE = 50% for flat bath operations with post-combustion. This equates to a net
efficiency of 35%.
Increased electrode consumption is a possibility. High bath stir rates may help to recover more of
this energy. If the heat is not transferred from the post-combustion gases then a high PCR can not
be expected since some of the CO2 will dissociate.70,71,72 During scrap melting oil and grease burn
off the scrap. CO and H2 concentration spikes occur when scrap falls into the bath. The hydrogen
from these organics tend to form hydoxyl ions which enhance the rate at which CO can be post-
combusted.67,73,74 The reaction between CO and O2 is believed to be a branched chain reaction
whose rate is greatly enhanced if a small quantity of H2 is present. Thus higher PCRs in the EAF
should be achieved during scrap meltdown. This benefit will not occur for post-combustion carried
out in the slag though oxygen injected into the slag will continue to react in the furnace freeboard
once it leaves the slag.
Nippon Steel found in their trials that for high offgas temperatures, radiation was the dominant heat
transfer mechanism but the net amount of heat that was transferred was low.75 For temperatures
<1765°C, heat transfer by radiation and convection accounted for 30% of the heat transfer. The
remainder was due to circulation of materials in the slag.
10.7.5.3.1.2 Post-Combustion in the Slag Layer
Praxair has taken the approach of using subsonic or
soft blowing of post-combustion oxygen through a multi-nozzle lance. The post-combustion lance
is positioned close to the primary oxygen injection lance. The impact of the supersonic primary
oxygen jet produces an emulsion of metal droplets in the slag. For post-combustion operations in
an EAF, Praxair estimates that 0.25% of the steel bath needs to be emulsified in order to transfer
all of the post-combustion heat. Praxair has found no evidence that post-combustion oxygen reacts
with the metal droplets or with carbon in the slag. Post-combustion is carried out both during scrap
melting and during a flat bath. During the start of scrap melting, post-combustion is difficult to
achieve because oxygen lances (especially water-cooled lances) cannot be introduced into the fur-
nace until sufficient scrap has meted back from the slag door. Information supplied by Praxair indi-
cates that they do not attempt to burn all of the CO which is generated. Rather, they attempt to burn
only a portion of the CO ranging from 10–50% of that which is generated from primary oxygen
lancing.
The injection of oxygen must be localized and well controlled to avoid oxygen reaction with the
electrodes. Previous trials for post-combustion in EAF slags have used a piggyback lance over top
of the decarburizing oxygen lance. Thus an attempt is made to burn the CO in the slag as it leaves
the bath.
The slag layer must be thick in order to avoid the reaction of CO2 with the bath to produce CO
which would make a high PCR difficult to achieve. In converter and bath smelting operations, the
slag layer is considerably thicker than in the EAF. Sumitomo proposed that a deep slag layer be
used with post-combustion in the upper layer of the slag where the oxygen would not react with
metal droplets.76 The temperature gradient in the slag layer was minimized with side blown oxy-
gen into the slag. From Nippon Steel indications were that moderate bath stirring is necessary to
accelerate reduction of iron ore and to enhance heat transfer from post-combustion.75 A thick slag
layer was used in order to separate the metal bath from the oxygen and the post-combustion prod-
ucts. A thick slag layer also helped to increase post-combustion and decrease dust formation. It
might prove economical to couple slag post-combustion in the EAF with addition of DRI/HBI fol-
lowing scrap melting operations although DRI addition typically results in much slag foaming.
Post-combustion could take place in the upper layer of the slag. Intense stirring would transfer heat
back to the slag/bath interface where the DRI/HBI would be melted. This could lead to optimum
energy recovery for post-combustion in the slag. Bath smelting results indicate that a net efficiency
of about 50% can be achieved when CO is post-combusted in the slag.75,77,78,79

During scrap melting operations, post-combustion above the slag low in the furnace freeboard
should give the best results. During flat bath operations, it may be advantageous to burn the CO
in or just above the slag. However, post-combustion in the slag will be a much more complicated
process and will require a greater degree of control over the post-combustion oxygen dispersion
pattern in the slag in order to prevent undesirable reactions.
10.7.5.3.2 Electrode Consumption
Previous studies have attributed electrode consumption to two
mechanisms:  sidewall consumption and tip erosion. Tip erosion is dependent on the electrical cur-
rent being carried by the electrode. Sidewall consumption is dependent on the surface temperature
of the electrode and can be controlled by providing water cooling of the electrode (sprays). During
the initial stages of meltdown, the scrap helps to shield the electrodes and the hot surface will not
react with oxygen present in the furnace. Once the scrap melts back from the electrodes, the hot
carbon surface will react with any oxygen that is present. The source of the oxygen can be injected
oxygen or oxygen that is present in air that is pulled into the EAF through the slag door.
If the electrodes are not shielded from the combustion products of post-combustion, carbon can
react with CO2 to form CO.53 The electrode will also react with any available oxygen. Both mech-
anisms will increase electrode consumption. At high offgas temperatures, the amount of electrode
consumption can increase drastically.
Readers are refered to Section 10.3.3 for electrode consumption factors developed by Bowman.
These indicate an increase in electrode consumption for operations using large amounts of oxygen
and those using post-combustion in the furnace.
10.7.5.3.3 Heatload to the EAF Shell
The usefulness of the heat generated by post-combustion will be
highly dependent on the effective heat transfer to the steel scrap and the bath. The theoretical adi-
abatic flame temperature for CO combustion with oxygen (2800°C) is similar to that for combus-
tion of natural gas with oxygen. It is well known that when oxy-fuel burners are fired at very high
rates on dense scrap, the flame can blow back against the water-cooled panels and overheat them.
If the heat from post-combustion is not rapidly transferred to the scrap, overheating of the panels
will also occur. If the combustion products do not penetrate the scrap, then most of the heat trans-
fer will be radiative and the controlling rate mechanism will be conductive heat transfer within the
scrap. This will be very slow compared to the radiative heat transfer to the scrap surface and will
result in local overheating.
10.7.5.3.4 Iron Yield
Oxy-fuel burner use can lead to yield losses and increased electrode con-
sumption as some combustion products react with iron to form FeO. Trials run by Leary and
Philbrook on the preheating of scrap with oxy-fuel burners showed that above scrap temperatures
of 760°C, 2–3% yield loss occurred.80 This is supported by work that shows that the thermody-
namic equilibrium between iron and CO2 at temperatures greater that 1377°C is 24% CO2. Gas
temperatures exceeding 1800°C are possible in the EAF and the corresponding equilibrium at this
temperature is 8.6% CO2. Though the gas residence time in the EAF probably will not allow for
equilibrium to be reached, some oxidation will occur. If additional carbon is not supplied a yield
loss will occur. This is likely to be the case for post-combustion. An iron yield loss of 1% equates
to a power input of 12 kWh/ton. This can have a significant effect on the overall post-combustion
heat balance resulting in a fictitiously high HTE for post-combustion.
As Fe is oxidized to FeO, a protective layer can form on the scrap. Once the FeO layer is formed,
oxygen must diffuse through the layer in order to react with the iron underneath. This will help to
protect the scrap from further oxidation if this layer does not peel off exposing the iron. At tem-
peratures above 1300°C the FeO will tend to melt and this protective layer will no longer exist.
10.7.5.3.5 Limits on Potential Gains from Post-Combustion
Bender indicates that CO emissions typi-
cally range between 0.3 and 2.6 kg/ton.81 Air infiltration into the furnace will result in natural post-

combustion. This is indicated in several EAF post-combustion studies where CO2 levels prior to
the trials are in the range of 15–40% and PCR ranges from 30–60%.44,50,53,57,59 With a post-
combustion system, CO levels typically dropped to below 10%. The starting level of CO has a big
effect on the efficiency obtained once post-combustion is installed. These results are presented in
Table 10.13.
CO2 has a higher heat capacity than CO. As a result for the same offgas temperature, the CO2 will
remove more heat per Nm3. Thus a portion of the post-combustion energy will be removed from
the furnace in the CO2. For an offgas temperature range of 1200–1400°C the maximum HTE is
limited to 93.6–92%. If the slag is heated by 110°C the heat contained is equivalent to 0.9–1.2
kWh/ton (assumes 4–5% slag). These factors should be taken into account.
Some benefits are generally unaccounted for when post-combustion is implemented. A decrease of
one minute in tap-to-tap time can save 2–3 kWh/ton.82 A more recent study indicates a savings of
1 kWh/ton for highly efficient furnaces.83 This is dependent on the efficiency of the current opera-
tion. Decreased cycle times should be considered when backing out the true heat transfer efficiency.
10.7.5.3.6 Environmental Benefits
Increased volumes of injected gas will tend to decrease the
amount of furnace infiltrated air. A positive pressure operation can save from 9–18 kWh/ton and
some savings can be expected to result from a reduction in air infiltration depending on the oper-
ation of the offgas system. However, a reduction in NOx due to reduced air infiltration has yet to
be shown in EAF post-combustion operations. If we consider the amount of air infiltration at the
start of meltdown we can see that the scrap will help to retard airflow into the furnace. Thus at the
start of meltdown, perhaps the effective opening area is only 25% of the slag door area. By the end
of meltdown this area is almost entirely open so now the effective opening might be 90% of the
slag door area.  Thus the amount of air infiltration into the furnace increases drastically over the
course of the meltdown period. This will have a big affect on the effectiveness of auxilliary post-
combustion oxygen added to the furnace.
Post-combustion helps the fume system capacity because the amount of heat that must be removed
by the water-cooled duct is decreased. Several operations report decreased offgas temperatures
when using post-combustion.49,58 CO emissions at the baghouse are a function of offgas system
design (sizing of the combustion gap, evacuation rate). Burning of some of the CO in the EAF will
help to ensure that less CO enters the canopy system which will help to reduce CO emissions.
Lower CO emissions have been reported in several EAF post-combustion operations.55,58 If CO
levels are reduced below 5% in the furnace, it may be difficult to complete CO combustion in the
offgas system following addition of dilution air at the combustion gap. Thus controlling CO levels

leaving the furnace to approximately 10% is a good practice. Alternatively a post-combustion
chamber may be used within the offgas system.
It has been shown that CO tends to react with NO at high temperatures to form nitrogen and car-
bon dioxide as follows:74
2CO + 2NO n 2CO2 + N2
(10.7.5)
Thus it is beneficial to have a certain amount of CO present in the furnace in order to reduce the
NO emissions. This is another good reason why total post-combustion of the CO is not desireable.
Trials carried out at Dofasco on their K-OBM showed that when excessive slag foaming occurred,
particulate emissions from the furnace increased by as much as 59%.84 Nippon Steel found that
a thick slag layer helped to increase post-combustion and decrease dust formation.75 For post-
combustion in the slag in the EAF, high dust generation rates should be expected unless a thick slag
layer is used. Excessive stirring of the bath will also lead to increased dust generation if metal
droplets react with the post-combustion oxygen.
10.7.5.3.7 Need for a Post-Combustion Chamber
If an attempt is made to burn close to all of the CO
in the furnace, it is likely that any CO exiting the furnace will not burn at the combustion gap
because the concentration will be below the lower flammability limit. If good heat transfer is not
achieved in the furnace, some of the CO2 will dissociate to CO and O2 and as a result the CO con-
centration in the offgas will be higher than anticipated. If the combustion gap is not designed
accordingly, there will be insufficient combustion air and some of the CO will report downstream
to the gas cleaning equipment. If chlorine and metallic oxides (catalyst) are present in the offgas
stream, there is a possibility of dioxin formation. The best way to ensure that this does not happen
is to install a combustion chamber followed by a water spray quench to cool the gases below the
temperature at which they will dissociate and react to form dioxins. This will also help to ensure
low levels of CO downstream in the offgas system.
10.7.5.4 Conclusions
The following conclusions are drawn.
1. High levels of PCR in excess of 80% have been demonstrated for EAF operations.
2. An upper limit of 65% can be expected for HTE from post-combustion when there is
cold scrap present. For post-combustion above the slag this will drop to 20–30% when
there is no scrap present. For post-combustion in the slag an HTE of 80% has been
reported. A net efficiency of 50–60% (PCR 3 HTE) may be achieved if DRI/HBI
is added to absorb the energy released by post-combustion or if good heat transfer
is achieved via circulation of metal droplets in the slag. During scrap melting oper-
ations, post-combustion above the slag should give the best results. During flat bath
operations, it appears to be advantageous to burn the CO in or just above the slag.
3. Environmental benefits due to post-combustion have been demonstrated, but addi-
tional work needs to be carried out to better understand and optimize these benefits.
4. Potential gains due to post-combustion are highly dependent on the individual EAF
operation efficiencies. Most applications of post-combustion in the EAF achieve an
energy savings of 20–40 kWh/ton.
5. The economic lower limit for CO level leaving the EAF needs to be established but
will likely be in the range of 5–10% based on environmental considerations.
6. If it is attempted to post-combust all of the CO in the EAF, yield losses and
increased electrode consumption will occur.
7. Attempts to post-combust all of the CO in the furnace will likely have a negative
effect on NOx levels.

8. Oxygen injection into the bath should start early so that post-combustion can be car-
ried out while the scrap is still relatively cold and is capable of absorbing the heat
generated. In order to be most effective decarburization oxygen needs to be distrib-
uted throughout the bath. This will help to reduce local iron oxidation in the bath
(and therefore the amount of EAF dust generated) and will also distribute the CO
that is generated throughout the furnace which will help to maximize energy recov-
ery once it is post-combusted.
9. Staged post-combustion similar to that carried out in the EOF preheat chambers has
the greatest potential for capturing the energy generated through post-combustion.
This is because the energy from the post-combustion reaction can be transferred to
the scrap thus cooling the offgas and avoiding dissociation. A similar effect can
probably be achieved in the shaft furnace. In the conventional EAF it will not be
possible to recover as much of this energy, and some gas dissociation will likely take
place.
10. Post-combustion in the slag can result in yield losses and an increase in the amount
of EAF dust generated unless a thick slag layer is used. Alternatively partial post-
combustion of the CO in the slag may prove to be more effective than complete
post-combustion. The additional fluxes and energy consumed to provide a thick slag
layer might offset any savings from post-combustion. In some operations where
scrap preheating takes place, the dust is captured on the scrap and a conventional
slag cover may be acceptable for post-combustion in the slag.
11. The optimum post-combustion strategy will vary from one operation to the next.
Careful deliberation must be undertaken to determine the most cost effective means
of applying post-combustion to EAF operations.  Frequently, the optimum approach
will involve selecting specific portions of the operating cycle in which post-com-
bustion can be applied to give the highest returns. Other issues such as operability
and maintenance requirements will also help to determine the complexity of the
strategy employed.
Complete post-combustion of CO will be difficult to achieve and is likely uneconomical in light
of possible detrimental effects (yield loss, refractory wear, electrode consumption, damage to fur-
nace panels). Thus a complete analysis should be carried out on each installation to determine the
best post-combustion practice for that location. Such a program should include CO, CO2, H2, H2O,
N2, NOx, SOx gas analysis at the elbow, offgas flowrate and temperature exiting the EAF and at the
baghouse, offgas analysis at the baghouse, analysis of baghouse dust before and after post-com-
bustion for increases in iron content, monitoring of iron yield, electrode consumption and other
consumables, monitoring EAF cooling water temperatures, slag analysis (check iron levels), and
monitoring alloy consumption (check alloy yield).
Post-combustion can be an effective tool for the EAF operator but an economical operating prac-
tice must be established based on individual site criteria. There is no universal recipe which can
apply for every facility. The way in which post-combustion can be applied is highly dependent on
raw materials and operating practices and these must be thoroughly evaluated when implementing
a post-combustion practice.
10.7.6 EAF Bottom Stirring
For conventional AC melting of scrap there is little natural convection within the bath. Temperature
gradients have been reported in the range of 40–70°C.43 If there is limited bath movement, large
pieces of scrap can take considerably longer to melt unless they are cut up as discussed previously
under oxygen lancing operations. Concentration gradients within the bath can also lead to reduced
reaction rates and over or under reaction of some portions of the bath.

The concept of stirring the bath is not a new one and records indicate that electromagnetic coils
were used for stirring trials as early as 1933.85 Japanese studies indicated that flow velocities are
much lower for stainless steels as compared to carbon steels for electromagnetic stirring.86 Studies
indicate that electromagnetic stirring is capable of supplying sufficient stirring in some cases.
However, the cost for electromagnetic stirring is high and it is difficult to retrofit into an existing
operation.
Most EAF stirring operations presently in use employ gas as the stirring medium.87,88 These oper-
ations use contact or non-contact porous plugs to introduce the gas into the furnace. In some cases
tuyeres are still used. The choice of gas used for stirring seems to be primarily argon or nitrogen
though some trials with natural gas and with carbon dioxide have also been attempted.89 In a con-
ventional EAF three plugs are located midway between the electrodes.87,88 For smaller furnaces a
single plug centrally located appears to be sufficient. In EBT and other bottom tapping operations,
the furnace tends to be elliptical and the nose of the furnace tends to be a cold spot. A stirring ele-
ment is commonly located in this part of the furnace to promote mixing and aid in meltdown. Some
operations have also found it beneficial to inject inert gas during tapping to help push the slag back
and prevent slag entrainment in the tap stream. For common steel grades the gas flowrate for a con-
tact system is typically 0.03–0.17 Nm3/min. (1–6 scfm) with a total consumption of 0.1–0.6
Nm3/ton (3–20 scf/ton).4 Non-contact systems appear to use higher gas flow rates. Service life for
contact systems is in the range of 300–500 heats. Some non-contact systems have demonstrated
lives of more than 4000 heats.90 Fig. 10.71 shows several commercially available stirring elements.
Some of the main advantages attributed to bottom stirring include: reduction in carbon boils and
cold bottoms, yield increases of 0.5–1%, time savings of 1–16 minutes (typical is 5 min.) per heat,

energy savings of up to 43 kWh/ton (typical is 10–20 kWh/ton), improved alloy recovery, increased
sulfur and phosphorus removal, and reduced electrode consumption.43,87–91
In various operations surveyed the cost savings have ranged from $0.90 to $2.30 per ton.89,90
10.7.7 Furnace Electrics
In addition to increased oxygen use in the EAF, considerable effort has been devoted towards max-
imizing electrical efficiency. This has been partly due to the fact that there are practical limitations
as to the amount of oxygen used in any one operation (due to environmental concerns). In addi-
tion, it has been realized that by using longer arc, lower current operations, it is possible to achieve
much more efficient power input to the furnace. Several innovations have contributed to increased
efficiencies in this area and are discussed in the following sections.
10.7.7.1 Electrode Regulation
In the days when furnaces melted small sized heats (5–20 tons), electrode regulation was not a
major concern. As furnaces became bigger and operating voltages increased however, it became
necessary to control the electrodes more closely in order to maximize the efficiency of power input
to the furnace. Over the past five years, there have been some substantial advances made in elec-
trode regulation.92,93 These coupled with advances in furnace hydraulics (thus allowing for faster
electrode response) have lead to considerable improvements in EAF operation. For one installation
the following benefits were obtained following an upgrade of the electrode regulation system:
power consumption decreased by 5%, flicker decreased by 10%, broken electrodes decreased by
90%, electrode consumption decreased by 8.5%, tap-to-tap time decreased by 18.5%, and average
power input increased by 8.5 %.92
10.7.7.2 Current Conducting Arms
In conventional EAF design, the current is carried to the electrodes via bus tubes. These bus tubes
usually contribute approximately 35% of the total reactance of the secondary electrical system.4
Current conducting arms combine the mechanical and electrical functions into one unit. These
arms carry the secondary current through the arm structure instead of through bus tubes. This
results in a reduction of the resistance and reactance in the secondary circuit which allows an
increase in power input rate without modification of the furnace transformer. Productivity is also
increased. Current conducting arms are constructed of copper clad steel or from aluminum.94–97
Some of the benefits attributed to current conducting arms include increased productivity,
increased power input rate (5–10%), reduced maintenance and increased reliability, lower electrode
consumption, and reduced electrode pitch circle diameter with a subsequent reduction in radiation
to sidewalls.94–97
The aluminum current conducting arms, Fig. 10.72, are up to 50% lighter than conventional or cop-
per clad steel arms. Several additional benefits are claimed including higher electrode speeds
resulting in improved electrode regulation, reduced strain on electrode column components, and
less mechanical wear of components.94,97
In comparison to the overall weight of arms and column, the weight of the arms should not be a
significant factor.
10.7.8 High Voltage AC Operations
In recent years a number of EAF operations have retrofitted new electric power supplies in order
to supply higher operating voltages.34,98–101 Energy losses in the secondary circuit are dependent
on the secondary circuit reactance and to a greater extent on the secondary circuit current. If power
can be supplied at a higher voltage, the current will be lower for the same power input rate.
Operation with a lower secondary circuit current will also give lower electrode consumption.34
Thus it is advantageous to operate at as high a secondary voltage as is practical. Of course this is

can allow voltage increases of up to 100% without adversely affecting flare to the furnace side-
walls.4 Energy losses can be minimized when reactance is associated with the primary circuit.
Supplementary reactance is not a new technology. In the past, supplementary reactors were used to
increase arc stability in small furnaces where there was insufficient secondary reactance. However,
in the past few years this method has been used to increase the operating voltages on the EAF sec-
ondary circuit. This is achieved by connecting a reactor in series with the primary windings of the
EAF transformer.98–100 This allows operation at a power factor of approximately !2w/2 which is
the theoretical optimum for maximum circuit power. This is made possible because the arc sees a
large storage device in front of it in the circuit, which in effect acts as an electrical flywheel dur-
ing operation. The insertion of the series reactor drops the secondary voltage to limit the amount
of power transferred to the arc. In order to compensate for this, the furnace transformer secondary
voltage is increased into the 900–1200V range allowing operation at higher arc voltages and lower
electrode currents. Some of the benefits attributed to this type of operation are a more stable arc
than for standard operations, electrode consumption reduced by 10%, secondary voltage increased
by 60–80%, power savings of 10–20 kWh/ton, system power factor of approximately 0.72, furnace
power factor of approximately 0.90, lower electrical losses due to lower operating current, and volt-
age flicker is reduced up to 40%.4,98–101
10.7.9 DC EAF Operations
The progress in high power semiconductor switching technology brought into existence low cost
efficient DC power supplies. Due to these advances, the high power DC furnace operation became
possible. North American interest in DC furnace technology is growing with several existing instal-
lations and others that are currently under installation.102–105 The DC arc furnace is characterized
by rectification of three phase furnace transformer voltages by thyristor controlled rectifiers. These
devices are capable of continuously modulating and controlling the magnitude of the DC arc cur-
rent in order to achieve steady operation. DC furnaces use only one graphite electrode with the
return electrode integrated into the furnace bottom. There are several types of bottom electrodes:
conductive hearth bottom, conductive pin bottom, single or multiple billet, and conductive fins in
a monolithic magnesite hearth.102
All of these bottom return electrode designs have been proven. The ones that appear to be used
most often are the conductive pin bottom where a number of pins are attached to a plate and form
the return path and the bottom billet design. The bottom electrode is air cooled in the case of the

pin type and water-cooled in the case of the billet design. The area between pins is filled with ram-
ming mix and the tip of the pins is at the same level as the inner furnace lining. As the refractory
wears, the pins also melt back. DC furnaces operate with a hot heel in order to ensure an electri-
cal path to the return electrode. During startup from cold conditions, a mixture of scrap and slag is
used to provide an initial electrical path. Once this is melted in, the furnace can be charged with
scrap.
Some of the early benefits achieved with DC operation included reduced electrode consumption
(20% lower than high voltage AC, 50% lower than conventional AC), reduced voltage flicker
(50–60% of conventional AC operation) and reduced power consumption (5–10% lower than for
AC).102,106–110
These results were mainly achieved on smaller furnaces which were retrofitted from AC to DC
operation. However, some larger DC furnace installations did not immediately achieve the claimed
benefits. Notably, two areas of concern emerged:  electrode consumption and refractory consumption.
Several DC furnace operations found that the decrease in electrode consumption expected under
DC operation did not occur. Much analysis by the electrode manufacturers indicated that physical
conditions within the electrodes was different for AC and DC operations. As a result, for large DC
electrodes carrying very large current, an increased amount of cracking and spalling was observed
as compared to AC operations. Therefore, it was necessary to develop electrodes with physical
properties better suited to DC operation. This is discussed in greater detail in Section 10.3 on elec-
trodes. The economical maximum size for DC furnaces tends to be a function of limitations due to
electrode size and current carrying capacity. At the present time the maximum economical size for
a single graphite electrode DC furnace appears to be about 165 tons. Larger furnace sizes can be
accommodated by using more than one graphite electrode. Fig. 10.73 shows furnace dimensions
for a Kvaerner Clecim DC EAF.

Several of the early DC operations experienced problems with refractory wear and bottom elec-
trode life. These problems were directly related to arc flare within the furnace. The anode design
has the greatest influence on the arc flare. In all DC furnaces, the electric arc is deflected in the
direction opposite to the power supply due to assymetries in magnetic fields which are generated
by the DC circuit. Thus the arc tends to concentrate on one area within the furnace creating a hot
spot and resulting in excessive refractory wear. This is shown in Fig. 10.74. Several solutions have
been developed to control or eliminate arc flare. All commercial bottom electrode designs are now
configured to force the arc to the center of the furnace. In the case of bottom conductive refractory
and the pin type bottom, it is necessary to provide split feed lines to the bottom anode or a bottom
coil which helps to modify the net magnetic field generated. In the billet bottom design, the amount
of current to each billet is controlled along with the direction of anode supply in order to control
the arc. The bottom fin design utilizes the fact that electrical feed occurs at several points in order
control arc deflection. Quadrants located further from the rectifier are supplied with higher current
than those located closer to the rectifier.
Some feel that the possibility for increased automation of EAF activities is greater for the DC fur-
nace.109,110 This is because with only one electrode, there is increased space both on top and within
the furnace. DC furnace installations can be expected to cost from 10–35% more than a compara-
ble AC installation.106,107 However, calculations on payback indicate that this additional cost can
be recovered in one to two years due to lower operating costs.106,107
Bowman conducted an analysis comparing AC and DC furnace operations and found that the elec-
trical losses amount to approximately 4% in AC operations and 5.5% in DC operations; the differ-
ence in absolute terms is relatively insignificant.9 The difference in total energy consumption
between AC and DC furnaces is likely less than 9 kWh/ton in favor of the DC furnace, however
many other variables influence the power consumption and it is difficult to develop accurate fig-
ures. DC furnaces experience roughly 25% less electrode consumption than AC furnaces, this cor-
relating to typically 0.4 kg/ton. This difference appears to be greater for smaller AC furnaces.
Flicker is approximately 60% lower for DC operations, however, advances in AC power system
configurations (additional reactance) may reduce this difference to 40%.
Some typical results which have been presented for large DC EAF operations are electrode con-
sumption of 1–2 kg/ton liquid steel, power consumption at 350–500 kWh/ton liquid steel, tap-to-
tap times of 45–120 minutes, and bottom life of 1500–4000 heats. It is important to remember

however, that power consumption is highly dependent on operating practices, tap temperature, use

10.7.10 Use of Alternative Iron Sources in the EAF
Hot metal production is a standard part of operations in integrated steelmaking. Hot metal is pro-
duced in the blast furnace from iron ore pellets. This hot metal is then refined in basic oxygen fur-
naces to produce steel. However, several operations which were previously integrated operations
are now charging hot metal to the EAF. One such installation is Cockerill Sambre in Belgium
where up to 40% of the total charge weight is hot metal. This installation gets its hot metal from a
blast furnace. In several other operations, hot metal is provided via Corex units, mini blast fur-
naces, or cupolas. In the case of the Saldahna Steel facility currently under construction in South
Africa, the EAF feed will consist of 45% hot metal and 55% DRI.
10.7.10.1 Effect of Feedstocks on EAF Operation
There is a wide range of tabulated effects for various iron alternatives in the EAF. This is primar-
ily due to the fact that within any given product such as DRI or HBI, a number of process para-
meters may vary quite considerably. These include % metallization, % carbon, % gangue, etc. All
of these parameters will have an affect on the energy requirement to melt the material. If there is
sufficient carbon to balance the amount of FeO in the DRI, the total iron content can be recovered.
Approximately 1% carbon is required to balance out 6% FeO. If insufficient carbon is present,
yield loss will result unless another source of carbon is added to the bath.. If excess carbon is pre-
sent, it can be used as an energy source in conjunction with oxygen injection in order to reduce
electrical power requirements. Generally speaking, DRI requires 100–200 additional kWh per ton
to melt as compared to scrap melting. If up to 25% DRI is to be used in the charge makeup, it can
be added in the bucket. If a larger percentage is to be used it can be fed continuously through the
roof. One advantage of DRI is that it can be fed continuously with power on and therefore no ther-
mal losses are incurred by opening the roof. HBI is more dense than DRI and as a result can be
charged in the scrap bucket without increasing the number of charges required. DRI tends to float
at the slag bath interface while HBI, which has a much higher density, tends to sink into the bath
and melt in a manner similar to pig iron. The amount of silica present in the DRI will have a large
effect on the economics of steel production from DRI. Silica will attack refractories unless suffi-
cient lime is present to neutralize its effect. In general, a V-ratio of 2.5–3.0 is desired for good slag
foaming. Thus the lime requirement increases greatly if silica levels in the DRI are high. Melting
power requirements increase accordingly.
In the case of cold pig iron, a power savings should result from using 10–15% pig iron in the
charge. This is due to the silicon and carbon contained in the pig iron. These act as a source of
chemical heat in the bath when oxygen is injected. Pig iron typically contains up to 0.65% silicon
which reacts with oxygen to produce silica which reports to the slag. This requires some additional
lime addition in order to maintain the slag basicity. Usually, a maximum of 20% cold pig iron is
used in the EAF because it takes longer to melt in than scrap, especially if it is supplied in large
pieces. Small sized pieces are preferable. The pig iron can contain up to 4% carbon which results
in a very high bath carbon level. Removal of this carbon with oxygen generates much heat but also
requires increased blowing times because practical limits exist on the rate at which oxygen can be
blown into the steel.
Iron carbide can be charged into the furnace in sacks or it can be injected. Injection is the preferred
method of introducing the material into the bath as recovery is maximized. This however creates
some practical limitations as to the quantity of iron carbide used since limitations on the injection
rate exist. At Nucor Crawfordsville, the maximum rate achieved so far is 2500 kg per minute. Iron
carbide dissolves into the steel bath and as the carbon goes into solution, it reacts with FeO or dis-
solved oxygen in the bath producing a very fine dispersion of carbon monoxide bubbles. These
bubbles are very beneficial because they help to strip nitrogen from the bath. Depending on the

degree of metallization in the iron carbide, the energy requirements for dissolution of the iron car-
bide also vary.
The charging of hot metal to the EAF sounds like a simple proposition though it is in fact quite
complex. Care must be taken that the hot metal which is charged does not react with the highly oxi-
dized slag which is still in the EAF. Some operations charge hot metal to the EAF by swinging the
roof and pouring it into the furnace. This causes very rapid mixing of the hot heel and the highly
oxidized slag in the EAF with the hot metal and sometimes explosions do occur. Thus for this mode
of operation it is recommended that a slag deoxidizer be added prior to hot metal addition. Typical
deoxidizers are silicon fines, aluminum fines and calcium carbide. An alternative method of charg-
ing the hot metal to the EAF is to pour it down a launder which is inserted into the side of the EAF.
This method requires more time for charging of the hot metal but results in a much safer operation.
Paul Wurth has recently developed a side charging system whereby the hot metal can be charged
while power is on and thus the charging time is not an issue.
10.7.11 Conclusions
It is apparent that there are many technologies available for improving EAF operating efficiency. The
general results for these have been listed in an attempt to provide a starting point for those in the
process of upgrading operations. Of course results will vary from one installation to the next. However
if a conservative approach is taken and the median of the reported results is used for calculation pur-
poses, the results can be expected to be achievable. It is important to evaluate the effects of certain
processes both on furnace operations and on other systems such as fume control. The use of substi-
tute fuels (oxygen and natural gas) may be limited by the capacity of the fume system. If upgrades are
to be made, one must also evaluate the need for upgrades to auxiliary systems. The data presented
in this section provides a starting point for the person evaluating process changes to improve EAF
efficiency. The technologies that have been reviewed are well proven. The interaction between these
processes has not been evaluated, though in some cases the blending of these operations can prove
to be most beneficial (eg. oxygen lancing, slag foaming and CO post-combustion). When evaluat-
ing upgrade requirements for a particular operation, it is necessary to clearly list the objectives and
then match these with suitable technologies. It is important to maintain a global perspective regard-
ing overall costs and operations in order to arrive at true optimal operating efficiency in the EAF.
10.8 Furnace Operations
10.8.1 EAF Operating Cycle
The electric arc furnace operates as a batch process. Each batch of steel that is produced is known
as a heat. The electric arc furnace operating cycle is known as the tap-to-tap cycle. The tap-to-tap
cycle is made up of the following operations:  furnace charging, melting, refining, de-slagging, tap-
ping and furnace turnaround. Modern operations aim for a tap-to-tap cycle of less than 60 minutes.
With the advance of EAF steelmaking into the flat products arena, tap-to-tap times of 35–40 min-
utes are now being sought with twin shell furnace operations.
A typical 60 minute tap-to-tap cycle is :

10.8.2 Furnace Charging
The first step in the production of any heat is to select the grade of steel to be made. Usually a heat
schedule is developed prior to each production shift. Thus the melter will know in advance the
schedule for the shift. The scrap yard operators will batch buckets of scrap according to the needs
of the melter. Preparation of the charge bucket is an important operation, not only to ensure proper
melt-in chemistry but also to ensure good melting conditions. The scrap must be layered in the
bucket according to size and density in order to ensure rapid formation of a liquid pool in the
hearth while also providing protection of the sidewalls and roof from arc radiation. Other consid-
erations include minimization of scrap cave-ins which can break electrodes and ensuring that large
heavy pieces of scrap do not lie directly in front of burner ports which would result in blow-back
of the flame onto the water-cooled panels. The charge can include lime and carbon or these can be
injected into the furnace during the heat. Many operations add some lime and carbon in the scrap
bucket and supplement this with injection.
The first step in any tap-to-tap cycle is charging of the scrap. The roof and electrodes are raised
and are swung out to the side of the furnace to allow the scrap charging crane to move a full bucket
of scrap into place over the furnace. The bucket bottom is usually a clam shell design—i.e. the
bucket opens up by retracting two segments on the bottom of the bucket, see Fig. 10.75. Another
common configuration is the “orange peel” design. The scrap falls into the furnace and the scrap
crane removes the scrap bucket. The roof and electrodes swing back into place over the furnace.
The roof is lowered and then the electrodes are lowered to strike an arc on the scrap. This com-
mences the melting portion of the cycle. The number of charge buckets of scrap required to pro-
duce a heat of steel is dependent primarily on the volume of the furnace and the scrap density.
Most modern furnaces are designed to operate with a minimum of backcharges. This is advanta-
geous because charging is dead time, whereby the furnace does not have power on and therefore is
not melting. Minimizing these dead times helps to maximize the productivity of the furnace. In
addition, energy is lost each time the furnace roof is opened. This can amount to 10–20 kWh/ton
for each occurrence. Most operations aim for 2–3 buckets of scrap per heat and will attempt to
blend their scrap to meet this requirement. Some operations achieve a single bucket charge.
Continuous charging operations such as Consteel and the Fuchs shaft furnace eliminate the charg-
ing cycle.

10.8.3 Melting
The melting period is the heart of EAF operations. The EAF has evolved into a highly efficient
melting apparatus and modern designs are focused on maximizing its melting capacity. Melting is
accomplished by supplying energy to the furnace interior. This energy can be electrical or chemi-
cal. Electrical energy is supplied via the graphite electrodes and is usually the largest contributor
in melting operations. Initially, an intermediate voltage tap is selected until the electrodes can bore
into the scrap. Usually, light scrap is placed on top of the charge to accelerate bore-in. After a few
minutes, the electrodes will have penetrated the scrap sufficiently that a long arc (high voltage) tap
can be used without fear of radiation damage to the roof. The long arc maximizes the transfer of
power to the scrap and a liquid pool of metal will form in the furnace hearth. Approximately 15%
of the scrap is melted during the initial bore-in period. At the start of melting the arc is erratic and
unstable. Wide swings in current are observed accompanied by rapid movement of the electrodes.
As the furnace atmosphere heats up the arcing tends to stabilize and once the molten pool is
formed, the arc becomes quite stable and the average power input increases.
Chemical energy can be supplied via several sources such as oxy-fuel burners and oxygen lancing.
Oxy-fuel burners burn natural gas using oxygen or a blend of oxygen and air. Heat is transferred
to the scrap by radiation and convection. Heat is transferred within the scrap by conduction. In
some operations, oxygen is used to cut scrap. Large pieces of scrap take longer to melt into the bath
than smaller pieces. A consumable pipe lance can be used to cut the scrap. The oxygen reacts with
the hot scrap and burns iron to produce intense heat for cutting the scrap. Once a molten pool of
steel is generated in the furnace, oxygen can be lanced directly into the bath. This oxygen will react
with several components in the bath including, aluminum, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, carbon
and iron. All of these reactions are exothermic (i.e. they generate heat) and will supply energy to
aid in the melting of the scrap. The metallic oxides which are formed will eventually reside in the
slag. The reaction of oxygen with carbon in the bath will produce carbon monoxide which may
burn in the furnace if there is oxygen available. Otherwise the carbon monoxide will carry over to
the direct evacuation system. Auxiliary fuel operations are discussed in more detail in Section 10.7.
Once enough scrap has been melted to accommodate the second charge, the charging process is
repeated. After the final scrap charge is melted, the furnace sidewalls can be exposed to high radi-
ation from the arc. As a result, the voltage must be reduced. Alternatively, creation of a foamy slag
will allow the arc to be buried and will protect the furnace shell. In addition, a greater amount of
energy will be retained in the slag and is transferred to the bath resulting in greater energy effi-
ciency. When the final scrap charge is fully melted, flat bath conditions are reached. At this point,
a bath temperature and a chemical analysis sample will be taken. The analysis of the bath chem-
istry will allow the melter to determine the amount of oxygen to be blown during refining. The
melter can also start to arrange for the bulk tap alloy additions to be made. These quantities are
confirmed following refining.
10.8.4 Refining
Refining operations in the electric arc furnace have traditionally involved the removal of phospho-
rus, sulfur, aluminum, silicon, manganese and carbon. In recent times, dissolved gases in the bath
have also become a concern, especially nitrogen and hydrogen levels. Traditionally, refining oper-
ations were carried out following meltdown , i.e. once a flat bath was achieved. These refining
reactions are all dependent upon oxygen being available. Oxygen was lanced at the end of melt-
down to lower the bath carbon content to the desired level for tapping. Most of the compounds
which are to be removed during refining have a higher affinity for oxygen than carbon. Thus the
oxygen will preferentially react with these elements to form oxides which will report to the slag.
In modern EAF operations, especially those operating with a hot heel, oxygen may be blown into
the bath throughout the heat cycle. As a result, some of the refining operations occur concurrent
with melting.
Steelmaking and Refining Volume

Most impurities such as phosphorous, sulfur, silicon, aluminum and chromium are partially
removed by transfer to the slag. These refining reactions are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. In
particular the equilibrium partition ratio between metal and slag are given as functions of slag
chemistry and temperature.
The slag in an EAF operation will, in general, have a lower basicity than that for oxygen steel-
making. In addition, the quantity of slag per ton of steel will also be lower in the EAF. Therefore
the removal of impurities in the EAF is limited. A typical slag composition is presented in Table
10.14.
Once these materials enter into the slag phase they will not necessarily stay there. Phosphorus
retention in the slag is a function of the bath temperature, the slag basicity and FeO levels in the
slag. At higher temperature or low FeO levels, the phosphorus will revert from the slag back into
the bath. Phosphorus removal is usually carried out as early as possible in the heat. Hot heel prac-
tice is very beneficial for phosphorus removal because oxygen can be lanced into the bath while
the bath temperature is quite low. Early in the heat the slag will contain high FeO levels carried
over from the previous heat. This will also aid in phosphorus removal. High slag basicity (i.e. high
lime content) is also beneficial for phosphorus removal but care must be taken not to saturate the
slag with lime. This will lead to an increase in slag viscosity which will make the slag less effec-
tive for phosphorus removal. Sometimes fluorspar is added to help fluidize the slag. Gas stirring
is also beneficial because it will renew the slag/metal interface which will improve the reaction
kinetics.
In general, if low phosphorus levels are a requirement for a particular steel grade, the scrap is
selected to give a low level at melt-in. The partition ratio of phosphorus in the slag to phosphorus
in the bath ranges from 5.0–15.0. Usually the phosphorus is reduced by 20–50% in the EAF.
However, the phosphorous in the scrap is low compared to hot metal and therefore this level of
removal is acceptable. For oxygen steelmaking higher slag basicity and FeO levels give a partition
ratio of 100 and with greater slag weight up to 90% of the phosphorous is removed.
Sulfur is removed mainly as a sulfide dissolved in the slag. The sulfur partition between the slag
and metal is dependent on the chemical analysis and temperature of the slag (high basicity is bet-
ter, low FeO content is better), slag fluidity (high fluidity is better), the oxidation level of the steel
(which should be as low as possible), and the bath composition. Generally the partition ratio is
3.0–5.0 for EAF operations.
It can be seen that removal of sulfur in the EAF will be difficult especially given modern practices
where the oxidation level of the bath is quite high. If high lime content is to be achieved in the slag,
it may be necessary to add fluxing agents to keep the slag fluid. Usually the meltdown slag must
be removed and a second slag built. Most operations have found it to be more effective to carry out
desulfurization during the reducing phase of steelmaking. This means that desulfurization is

commonly carried out during tapping (where a calcium aluminate slag is built) and during ladle
furnace operations. For reducing conditions where the bath has a much lower oxygen activity, dis-
tribution ratios for sulfur of 20–100 can be achieved.
Control of the metallic constituents in the bath is important as it determines the properties of the
final product. Usually, the melter will aim for lower levels in the bath than are specified for the
final product. Oxygen reacts with aluminum, silicon and manganese to form metallic oxides which
are slag components. These metallics tend to react before the carbon in the bath begins to react with
the oxygen, see Table 2.1 in Chapter 2. These metallics will also react with FeO resulting in a
recovery of iron units to the bath. For example:
Mn + FeO = MnO + Fe
(10.8.1)
Manganese will typically be lowered to about 0.06% in the bath.
The reaction of carbon with oxygen in the bath to produce CO is important as it supplies energy to
the bath and also carries out several important refining reactions at the same time. In modern EAF
operations, the combination of oxygen with carbon can supply between 30 and 40% of the net heat
input to the furnace. Evolution of carbon monoxide is very important for slag foaming. Coupled
with a basic slag, CO bubbles will help to inflate the slag which will help to submerge the arc. This
gives greatly improved thermal efficiency and allows the furnace to operate at high arc voltages
even after a flat bath is reached. Submerging the arc helps to prevent nitrogen from being exposed
to the arc where it will dissociate and become dissolved in the steel.
If the CO is evolved within the bath, it will also remove nitrogen and hydrogen from the steel. The
capacity for nitrogen removal is dependent on the amount of CO generated in the metal. Nitrogen
levels as low as 50 ppm can be achieved in the furnace prior to tap. Bottom tapping is beneficial
for maintaining low nitrogen levels as tapping is fast and a tight tap stream is maintained. A high
oxygen content in the steel is beneficial for reducing nitrogen pickup at tap as compared to deox-
idation of the steel at tap.
At 1600°C, the maximum solubility of nitrogen in pure iron is 450 ppm. Typically, the nitrogen lev-
els in the steel following tapping are 80–100 ppm. An equation describing the solubility of nitro-
gen in the steel is given in Chapter 2.
Decarburization is also beneficial for the removal of hydrogen. It has been demonstrated that
decarburizing at a rate of 1% per hour can lower hydrogen levels in the steel from 8 ppm down to
2 ppm in ten minutes.
At the end of refining, a bath temperature measurement and a bath sample are taken. If the tem-
perature is too low, power may be applied to the bath. This is not a big concern in modern melt-
shops where temperature adjustment is carried out in the ladle furnace.
10.8.5 Deslagging
Deslagging operations are carried out to remove impurities from the furnace. During melting and
refining operations, some of the undesirable materials within the bath are oxidized and enter the
slag phase.
Thus it is advantageous to remove as much phosphorus into the slag as early in the heat as possi-
ble (i.e. while the bath temperature is still low). Then the slag is poured out of the furnace through
the slag door. Removal of the slag eliminates the possibility of phosphorus reversion.
During slag foaming operations, carbon may be injected into the slag where it will reduce FeO to
metallic iron and will generate carbon monoxide which helps to inflate the slag. If the high phos-
phorus slag has not been removed prior to this operation, phosphorus reversion will occur.

10.8.6 Tapping
Once the desired bath composition and temperature are achieved in the furnace, the taphole is
opened and the furnace is tilted so that the steel can be poured into a ladle for transfer to the next
batch operation (usually a ladle furnace or ladle station). During the tapping process bulk alloy
additions are made based on the bath analysis and the desired steel grade. Deoxidizers may be
added to the steel to lower the oxygen content prior to further processing. This is commonly
referred to as blocking the heat or killing the steel. Common deoxidizers are aluminum or silicon
in the form of ferrosilicon or silicomanganese. Most carbon steel operations aim for minimal slag
carryover. A new slag cover is built during tapping. For ladle furnace operations, a calcium alumi-
nate slag is a good choice for sulfur control. Slag forming compounds are added in the ladle at tap
so that a slag cover is formed prior to transfer to the ladle furnace. Additional slag materials may
be added at the ladle furnace if the slag cover is insufficient. Fig. 10.76 shows an EBT furnace tap-
ping into a ladle.
10.8.7 Furnace Turnaround
Furnace turnaround is the period following completion of tapping until the first scrap charge is
dropped in the furnace for the next heat. During this period, the electrodes and roof are raised and
the furnace lining is inspected for refractory damage. If necessary, repairs are made to the hearth,
slagline, taphole and spout. In the case of a bottom tapping furnace, the taphole is filled with sand.
Repairs to the furnace are made using gunned refractories or mud slingers. In most modern fur-
naces, the increased use of water-cooled panels has reduced the amount of patching or fettling
required between heats. Many operations now switch out the furnace bottom on a regular basis
(every 2–6 weeks) and perform the maintenance off-line. This reduces the power-off time for the

EAF and maximizes furnace productivity. Furnace turnaround time is generally the largest dead
time in the tap-to-tap cycle. With advances in furnace practices this has been reduced from 20 min-
utes to less than five minutes in some newer operations.
10.8.8 Furnace Heat Balance
To melt steel scrap, it takes a theoretical minimum of 300 kWh/ton. To provide superheat above the
melting point of 1520°C (2768°F) requires additional energy and for typical tap temperature
requirements, the total theoretical energy required usually lies in the range of 350–370 kWh/ton.
However, EAF steelmaking is only 55–65% efficient and as a result the total equivalent energy
input is usually in the range of 560–680 kWh/ton for most modern operations. This energy can be
supplied from a number of sources including electricity, oxy-fuel burners and chemical bath reac-
tions. The typical distribution is 60–65%, 5–10% and 30–40% respectively. The distribution selec-
tion will be highly dependent on local material and consumable costs and tends to be unique to the
specific meltshop operation. A typical balance for both older and more modern EAFs is given in
the Table 10.15.
Several factors are immediately apparent from these balances. Much more chemical energy is
being employed in the EAF and correspondingly, electrical power consumption has been reduced.
Furnace efficiency has improved with UHP operation as indicated by the greater percentage of
energy being retained in the steel. Losses to cooling water are higher in UHP operation due to the
greater use of water-cooled panels. Miscellaneous losses such as electrical inefficiencies were
much greater for older, low powered operations. Energy loss to the furnace offgas is much greater
in UHP furnace operation due to greater rates of power input and shorter tap-to-tap times.
Of course the figures in Table 10.15 are highly dependent on the individual operation and can vary
considerably from one facility to another. Factors such as raw material composition, power input
rates and operating practices (e.g. post-combustion, scrap preheating) can greatly alter the energy
balance. In operations utilizing a large amount of charge carbon or high carbon feed materials, up
to 60% of the energy contained in the offgas may be calorific due to large quantities of uncom-
busted carbon monoxide. Recovery of this energy in the EAF could increase energy input by
8–10%. Thus it is important to consider such factors when evaluating the energy balance for a
given furnace operation.
The International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) classifies EAFs based on the power supplied per
ton of furnace capacity. For most modern operations, the design would allow for at least 500 kVA
per ton of capacity. The IISI report on electric furnaces indicates that most new installations allow

for 900–1000 kVA per ton of furnace capacity.18 Most furnaces operate at a maximum power fac-
tor of 0.85. Thus the above transformer ratings would correspond to a maximum power input of
0.75–0.85 MW per ton of furnace capacity.
10.9 New Scrap Melting Processes
Over the past ten years the steelmaking world has seen many changes in operating practices and
the utilization of new process concepts in an attempt to lower operating costs and to improve prod-
uct quality. In addition many new alternatives have been presented as lower cost alternatives to con-
ventional AC EAF melting. Some of the specific objectives of these processes include lowering
specific capital costs, increasing productivity, and improving process flexibility.
All of these processes share one or more of the following features in common. Energy from the
waste offgas is used to preheat the scrap. Carbon is added to the bath and is later removed by oxy-
gen injection in order to supply energy to the process. An attempt is made to combust the CO gen-
erated in the process to maximize energy recovery. An attempt is made to maximize power-on time
and minimize turnaround time.
The EOF was one of the first scrap melting processes to use hot metal, post-combustion and scrap
preheating and is described in Chapter 13.
Many of these process have their roots associated with scrap preheating. It is only fitting that this
be discussed first in order to provide the groundwork for the development of these processes.
10.9.1 Scrap Preheating
Scrap preheating has been used for over 30 years to offset electrical steel melting requirements pri-
marily in regions with high electricity costs such as Japan and Europe. Scrap preheating involves
the use of hot gas to heat scrap in the bucket prior to charging. The source of the hot gases can be
either offgases from the EAF or gases from a burner. The primary energy requirement for the EAF
is for heating of the scrap to its melting point. Thus energy can be saved if scrap is charged to the
furnace hot. Preheating of scrap also eliminates the possibility of charging wet scrap which elimi-
nates the possibility of furnace explosions. Scrap preheating can reduce electrical consumption and
increase EAF productivity.
Some suppliers have noted that there is a maximum preheat temperature beyond which further
efforts to heat the scrap lead to diminished returns. This temperature lies in the range of
540–650°C. It is estimated that by preheating the scrap to a temperature of 425–540°C, a total of
63–72 kWh/ton of electrical energy can be saved. Early scrap preheaters used independent heat
sources. The scrap was usually heated in the scrap bucket. Energy savings reported from this type
of preheating were as high as 40 kWh/ton with associated reductions in electrode and refractory
consumption due to reduced tap-to-tap times.4,18
As fourth hole offgas systems were developed, attempts were made to use the EAF offgas for scrap
preheating. A side benefit that was reported was that the amount of baghouse dust decreased
because the dust was sticking to the scrap during preheating. Scrap preheating with furnace offgas
is difficult to control due to the variation in offgas temperature throughout the melting cycle. In
addition a temperature gradient forms within the scrap. Temperatures must be controlled to prevent
damage to the scrap bucket and in order to prevent burning or sticking of fine scrap within the
bucket. Scrap temperatures can reach 315–450°C (600–850°F) though this will only occur at the
hot end where the offgas first enters the preheater. Savings are typically only in the neighborhood
of 18–23 kWh/ton.4 In addition, as operations become more efficient and tap-to-tap times are
decreased, scrap preheating operations become more and more difficult to maintain. Scrap han-
dling operations can actually lead to reduced productivity and increased maintenance costs. At
Badische Stalwerke the energy savings due to scrap preheating were decreased by 50% when tap-
to-tap time was reduced by one third.

Some of the benefits attributed to scrap preheating are increased productivity by 10–20%, reduced
electrical consumption, removal of moisture from the scrap, and reduced electrode and refractory
consumption per unit production. Some drawbacks to scrap preheating are that volatiles are
removed from the scrap, creating odors and necessitating a post-combustion chamber downstream.
In addition spray quenching following post-combustion is required to prevent recombination of
dioxins and furans. Depending on the preheat temperature, buckets may have to be refractory lined.
10.9.2 Preheating With Offgas
Preheating with offgas from the EAF requires that the offgas be rerouted to preheat chambers
which contain loaded scrap buckets. The hot gases are passed through the buckets thus preheating
the scrap. For tap-to-tap times less than 70 minutes the logistics of scrap preheating lead to mini-
mal energy savings that will not justify the capital expense of a preheating system. Typical savings
are in the range of 15–20 kWh/ton. Some examples of preheating systems are given in Fig. 10.77
and Fig. 10.78.
10.9.3 Natural Gas Scrap Preheating
Natural gas scrap preheating originated in the 1960s and usually involves a burner mounted in a
refractory lined roof which sits over the top of the scrap bucket. Scrap is typically preheated to
540–650°C. Above 650°C, scrap oxidation becomes a problem and yield loss becomes a factor.
Advantages of this form of scrap preheating are that the preheating process is decoupled from EAF
operations and as a result the process is unaffected by tap-to-tap time. However, heat is provided
by natural gas as opposed to offgas and as a result an additional cost is incurred.
One of the primary concerns with scrap preheating is that oil and other organic materials associ-
ated with the scrap tend to evaporate off during preheating. This can lead to discharge of hydro-

carbons to the atmosphere and foul odors in the shop environment. In some Japanese operations,
this has been remedied by installing a post-combustion chamber following scrap preheating oper-
ations. In one such operation scrap preheating is conducted in conjunction with a furnace enclo-
sure. It is reported that power savings are 36–40 kWh/ton and electrode consumption is reduced by
0.4–0.6 kg/ton. It is not specified what the additional capital costs and maintenance costs were for
this system. In North America, most operations find that the savings offered by conventional scrap
preheating do not compensate for the additional handling operations and additional maintenance
requirements.
10.9.4 K-ES
The K-ES process is a technology developed jointly by Klockner Technology Group and Tokyo
Steel Manufacturing group. Subsequently the rights to the process were acquired by VAI. The
process uses pulverized or lumpy coal in the bath as a source of primary energy. Oxygen is injected
into the bath to combust the coal to CO gas. The CO gas is post-combusted in the furnace free-
board with additional oxygen to produce CO2. Thus a large portion of the calorific heat in the
process is recovered and is transferred to the bath. In addition the stirring action caused by bottom
gas injection results in better bath mixing and as a result accelerated melting of the scrap. The
process is shown schematically in Fig. 10.79. Fig. 10.80 shows the carbon and oxygen injectors
used in K-ES. Fig. 10.81 presents oxygen consumption versus electrical power consumption.
10.9.4.1 Historical Development 
The first K-ES installation was at Tokyo steel in 1986, where a 30 ton EAF was converted to run
trials on the process. A productivity increase of 20% and an electrical savings of approximately 110
kWh/ton resulted. Thus the process concept was proven on an industrial scale.18
In 1988, Ferriere Nord in Italy decided to install the K-ES process on its 88 ton EAF in Osoppo.
At that time Ferriere Nord was producing approximately 550,000 tons per year of steel on a 1975
vintage EAF that was originally designed to produce 220,000 tons per year. This had been accom-
plished through a combination of long arc/foamy slag practice, high oxygen utilization (32
Nm3/ton), water-cooled furnace roof and walls and oxy-fuel burners. The first K-ES heat took
place early in 1989 following the installation of post-combustion lances, coal injection equipment
and bottom injection tuyeres. This process continues to operate at Ferriere Nord.
In December 1989 another K-ES facility was installed on a 82 ton oval tapping furnace at
Acciaierie Venete in Padua, Italy. This operation differs in that the A phase electrode is hollow and
is used for carbon injection. This installation has seven post-combustion lances that are mounted
into the furnace wall, through the water-cooled panels. Five bottom tuyeres are located to form a
pitch circle positioned between the furnace wall and the electrode pitch circle. The operation at

Venete has achieved a productivity of 2.2 tons/MW. Tap-to-tap times average 54 minutes even
though the transformer is only capable of supply a maximum of 45 MW.41,46
10.9.4.2 Results
At Tokyo Steel the average power consumption for a set of trials was 255 kWh/ton with an aver-
age coal injection rate of 24 kg/ton. This gave an electrical power replacement of 4–5.5 kWh/kg of
coal injected. In addition the melting time was reduced from 60 minutes to 48–50 minutes.
Ferrosilicon and ferromanganese consumption was also decreased by 1.1 kg/ton. Results are pre-
sented in Table 10.16.

Following installation and testing of the K-ES system at Tokyo Steel, an 88 ton furnace at Ferriere
Nord was converted to K-ES operation. Lumpy coal is added in the charge and additional powdered
coal is injected into the bath. Oxygen consumption is 50 Nm3/ton. The distribution of this oxygen
is as follows: 13 Nm3/ton is injected to the bath via tuyeres, 13 Nm3/ton is injected to the bath via
an oxygen lance and 18 Nm3/ton is injected into the freeboard through post-combustion lances.
Typically carbon consumption is on the order of 20 kg/ton unless the charge is 30% hot pig metal,
in which case the carbon consumption is 13 kg/ton. Electrical energy consumption decreased by 60
kWh/ton with the K-ES operation. An energy balance showed that the electrical savings were
highly dependent on efficient post-combustion of the process gases in the freeboard.
Best results at Ferriere Nord were achieved at conditions of 180 kWh/ton, 53 Nm3 O2/ton (1850
scf O2/ton), 30% pig iron and tap-to-tap time of 35 minutes and at conditions of 255 kWh/ton, 40
Nm3 O2/ton (1400 scf O2/ton), 100% scrap and tap-to-tap time of 53 minutes.
Similar results have been obtained at Acciaerie Venete using a Fuchs OBT furnace with K-ES.

10.9.5 Danarc Process
The Danieli Danarc process combines high impedance technology with high chemical energy input
to the furnace in order to achieve high productivity and energy efficiency. The first installation of
this technology was at Ferriere Nord in Italy. Features for chemical energy input are very similar
to K-ES. Bottom tuyeres are used to inject oxygen and carbon. Sidewall lances are also used. Post-
combustion oxygen is supplied via burners. Fig. 10.82 shows a top view of the Danarc furnace at
Ferriere Nord.
The purpose of tuyeres installed in the furnace bottom is to distribute the oxygen throughout the
furnace in order to maximize the decarburization rate. With just oxygen lancing, the area around
the lance becomes depleted of carbon and some of the oxygen reacts with iron. CO is generated
mostly in one part of the furnace around the injection point. With multiple tuyeres, CO generation
is spread out within the furnace and the potential for heat recovery via post-combustion is greater.
Injection at several points also gives good bath mixing, an added benefit. Multiple sidewall carbon
injectors allow for good control of slag foaming across the whole surface of the bath.
Natural gas, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are used as shroud gas for the oxygen tuyeres. Wear rates
are approximately 0.5 mm per heat.47,49
Traditionally, a series reactor has been installed on the primary side of the furnace transformer to
allow for high impedance operation. This allows the furnace to operate at long arc (i.e. high volt-
age) and low electrode current which gives high arc stability, improved power input to the bath and
reduced electrode consumption.
Alternatively, the saturable reactor provides a method to reduce both current and reactive power
fluctuation. This reduces the electrodynamic stresses on the furnace transformer secondary circuit
and reduces the flicker level in the supply network. The main purpose of the saturable reactor is to
control the reactance so as to minimize current fluctuations. The saturable reactor acts as a variable
reactance controlled by the excitation current. The current control performance becomes similar to
a DC furnace with thyristor controlled current. Several advantages resulting from the use of the sat-
urable reactor are that current fluctuations and electrodynamic stresses are limited, reactive power

fluctuations are reduced resulting in less flicker, energy transfer to the melt is improved, reduced
electrode consumption, and tap changing is not necessarily required.
The following results are reported for Ferriere Nord for a charge makeup of 82% scrap and 18%
cold pig iron. Tap-to-tap time of 50 minutes was achieved, with an aggregate power-on time of 40
minutes. Power consumption was 270 kWh/ton liquid. Electrode consumption was 1.6 kg/ton liq-
uid. Total oxygen consumption was 50 Nm3/ton liquid while total natural gas consumption was 10
Nm3/ton liquid. Total carbon introduced was 10 kg/ton liquid. The resultant tap temperature was
1640°C. For 100% scrap operation, the power consumption increases by 23 kWh/ton liquid.47,49
Trials have also been run using hot metal, with 70% scrap and 30% hot pig iron as part of the
charge. The results were a tap-to-tap time of 45 minutes and a power-on time of 38 minutes. Power
consumption was 160 kWh/ton liquid. Electrode consumption was 1.0 kg/ton liquid. Total oxygen
consumption was 40 Nm3/ton liquid and total natural gas consumption was 2.2 Nm3/ton liquid. Air
supplied to burners was 9 Nm3/ton liquid and total carbon injected was 14.9 kg/ton liquid.
Resultant tap temperature was 1680°C. 47,49
10.9.6 Fuchs Shaft Furnace
The need to reduce the amount of power input into EAF operations lead to a prototype study of a shaft
furnace at Danish Steel Works Ltd (DDS).18,112 The concept was to load scrap into a shaft where
it would be preheated by offgases exiting the EAF. The scrap sat in a column at one end of the fur-
nace and was constantly fed into the furnace as the scrap at the bottom of the column melted away.
In January 1990, a production shaft preheater was retrofitted to one of DDS’s two 125 ton EAFs.
DDS stopped using the shaft after less than two years of operation. This was partly due to the prob-
lems of maintaining a suitable scrap flow in the shaft. In addition, Danish tariff regulations on elec-
tricity made a three shift per day operation uneconomical. As a result DDS could not move to a
single furnace operation which would make full use of the preheating shaft.
10.9.6.1 Single Shaft Furnace
The Fuchs shaft furnace concept was installed at Co-Steel Sheerness113,114 in England in 1992. This
installation is the outcome of work done in Denmark at DET Danske Stalvalsevaerk on first and sec-
ond versions of the process. The process has a shaft with a conventional oval EAF bottom with three
phase AC arcs. Fig. 10.83 illustrates the shaft. The relatively short shaft is scrap bucket fed. Unlike the
EOF, there are no movable fingers and the scrap descends continuously into the bath where the arcs
and oxygen produce the unrefined metal. The Fuchs shaft preheater at Sheerness consists of a reverse
taper (larger at bottom) shaft which sits on the furnace roof, offset from the furnace centerline.
The furnace shell is mounted on a frame and is tilted by means of four hydraulic cylinders mounted
in each corner of the frame, enabling the furnace shell to be lowered by one foot to the first bucket
charging position or to be tilted into the tapping or deslagging positions. The furnace runs on four
tracks, two in the center and two on the outside. The furnace water-cooled roof, the shaft and the
electrode gantry are fixed and do not tilt.
Energy input to the furnace is from an 80 MVA transformer, 6 MW oxy-fuel burners and a water-
cooled oxygen lance.
A typical operating cycle is as follows. The heat cycle is started by charging the first basket of
scrap. The furnace is lowered one foot onto a bumper and the furnace car is moved west to the
charging position where the first bucket is held on a bale arm support structure. The bucket is
opened remotely via claw-type actuators. The first charge is approximately 44 tons of scrap.
Once the furnace has been charged it is moved back under the roof and is raised back to the upper
position. The second bucket is then charged to the shaft. The second charge is approximately 35
tons. The complete charge cycle for the first two buckets of scrap is typically less than two min-
utes. Meltdown commences and after approximately four minutes the electrodes are raised and the

third and final scrap bucket is charged to the shaft. Meltdown then proceeds uninterrupted and the
furnace taps 99 tons at 1640°C with an average power-on time of 34 minutes.
The Fuchs shaft has claimed benefits ranging from reduced EAF dust (due to dust sticking to the
scrap in the shaft) to reduced exhaust fan requirements due to lower gas volumes. As all of the scrap
is melting in, the zinc quickly volatizes, resulting in furnace dust that is high in zinc content. For a
120 ton furnace with an 80 MVA transformer, Fuchs predicts a tap-to-tap time of 56 minutes with
an electrical power consumption of approximately 310 kWh/ton. The projections anticipate that the
equivalent of 72 kWh/ton of energy will be recovered from the offgas.
The results reported by Co-Steel Sheerness PLC have indicated the following:115
1. Liquid steel yield, due to high FeO reversion from the slag, resulted in an average
of 93.5%.
2. The volume of flue dust produced by the shaft furnace was 20% lower than for the
conventional furnace ( 14 kg/ton billet compared to 18 kg/ton billet).
3. The flue dust chemistry was changed with shaft furnace operation. The zinc oxide
content rose from 22% to 30%. In addition the lime content was decreased from
13% to 5%.
4. Fan power requirements for the fume extraction fans were decreased from 19.3
kWh/ton billet to 10 kWh/ton billet due to lower gas volumes.
Table 10.17 presents results for various trials conducted at Co-Steel Sheerness. As can be seen, the
amount of burner power was increased considerably in the most recent set of trials. The burner effi-

ciency that was achieved was much higher than that in a conventional furnace as the flame contacted
cold scrap for a longer duration. In addition the CO content in the offgas was monitored in order
to adjust the oxygen flow to the burners to promote CO post-combustion at the base of the shaft.116
Fuchs has other single shaft furnaces, of similar design, operating in Turkey, China, Malaysia and
at North Star Steel in Arizona. The latter, Fig. 10.84, is powered with a DC transformer and is
equipped with an ABB DC bottom.

10.9.6.2 The Double Shaft Furnace (DSF)
In order to increase the production capacity of a furnace with one transformer to over 1,000,000
tons per year, the double shaft furnace was developed. There are currently two in operation in
Europe, SAM in France and ARBED in Luxembourg, Fig. 10.85. Both are 95 ton AC high imped-
ance furnaces which, when fully utilized, deliver a liquid steel capacity of over 1,000,000 tons per
year. The double shaft furnace utilizes one transformer and one set of electrodes for both furnace
shells.
North Star BHP Steel Ltd. started up the first double shaft furnace in the United States. This fur-
nace, with a tap weight of 180 tons, has a rated capacity of 1,700,000 tons per year. The AC trans-
former is rated at 140 MVA and will operate with a secondary voltage of 1200–1300 V. All (100%)
of the scrap charged can be preheated. A savings in electric energy consumption of between
100–120 kWh/ton is projected in comparison with a single shell EAF based on 100% scrap charge.
North Star BHP Steel plans to utilize DRI/HBI and/or pig iron as part of the charge. This type fur-
nace would also be well suited for the use of iron carbide.
The trend toward the use of more fossil energy by electric arc furnace steelmakers will result in
more latent energy in the offgas, primarily in the form of CO. Measurements indicate a value of
energy in the offgas of 170–190 kWh/ton in a standard single shell EAF operation. In addition,
instead of using energy to circulate water in the duct system to cool the hot offgases, this energy
could instead be utilized to heat and melt the scrap, as is done in shaft furnaces.
The double shaft furnace at SAM, Table 10.18, currently operates with a typical scrap charge that
is 25% heavy scrap, 30% shredded, 5% municipal recycled, 15% galvanized sheet, 10% turnings

and 15% light scrap. Three charge buckets are used. A round bucket holding 50 % of the charge is
used to charge the furnace. Two rectangular buckets each containing 25 % of the charge are used
to charge the shaft. While one shell (A) is tapping, the electrodes are moved to the other shell (B)
to begin meltdown. Bore-in proceeds at a voltage of 750V. Meltdown then proceeds at 900 V. Six
burners located at the bottom of the shaft aid meltdown. Vessel A, once finished tapping, is charged
with 75% of the total charge. The burners in this vessel are placed on high fire to help preheat the
scrap. Vessel B completes meltdown and its offgases are directed to the vessel A to aid in scrap pre-
heating. The remaining 25% of the scrap is now charged to the shaft. Once vessel B is ready to tap,
the electrodes are moved back over to vessel A to start another meltdown cycle.117

10.9.6.3 The Finger Shaft Furnace
Various studies have shown that the greatest proportion of the energy leaving the furnace in the
offgas occurs during flat bath operations. This is due to the absence of scrap to absorb energy
from the offgas as it exits the furnace. A large potential for energy recovery exists if the offgas
can be used to preheat scrap. For operations with continuous feed of high carbon iron units (e.g.
DRI or iron carbide), the amount of energy escaping in the offgas will be higher yet due to the
higher levels of carbon monoxide in the offgas. Finger shaft furnace installations with tap weights
ranging from 77–165 tons are located at Hylsa, Cockerill Sambre, Swiss Steel AG and Birmingham
Steel.
To use the energy of the offgas efficiently and to reduce the electrical power requirements needed
to obtain short tap-to-tap times, Fuchs developed the finger shaft furnace at Hylsa in Monterrey,
Mexico. This furnace, tapping 150 tons, maintains a 44 ton liquid heel and is powered with a 156
MVA DC transformer utilizing the Nippon Steel water-cooled DC bottom electrode (3 billet bot-
tom electrode). Reported consumption figures are presented in Table 10.21. The furnace charge is
45% scrap and 55% DRI charged during the 50 minute power-on time of the furnace. Half of the
scrap is charged onto a water-cooled finger system in the shaft during the refining period of the
previous heat. The other half of the scrap is charged onto the fingers after the first charge has been
dropped into the furnace and power is applied.
The furnace roof and shaft sit on a trolley which moves on rails mounted on the slag door and tap-
ping sides of the furnace. To initiate a heat, the electrode is raised and rotated away from the fur-
nace. The shaft is moved into position over the furnace center and the fingers are retracted so that
the preheated scrap is charged onto the hot heel. The roof is then moved back and the electrode is
returned to its operating position. A second scrap charge is added to the shaft and DRI is fed con-
tinuously throughout meltdown. Once the first scrap charge is melted, the second charge is added
to the center of the furnace. Initial bore-in utilizes a voltage of 400V and is increased to 550V once
the electrode has penetrated to about one metre. During meltdown a voltage of 635V is used.
During meltdown of the second scrap charge and refining, the first charge for the next heat is pre-
heated in the shaft. The DRI, containing 2.3% carbon, is cold and continuously charged. Oxy-fuel
burners are used during scrap meltdown. Future plans call for running the burners with excess oxy-
gen for post-combustion of CO.
A finger shaft furnace is now operating at Swiss Steel AG (Von Roll). This furnace was converted
in only five weeks. It is powered with a high impedance AC transformer. They have seen a 55%
improvement in productivity and are tapping 79 tons of steel every 37 minutes. Reported con-
sumption figures are presented in Table 10.22.

This operating data indicates that 30 minute tap-to-tap times are likely to be achieved in the
future.
Paul Wurth S.A. has installed a 154 ton DC finger shaft furnace at Cockerill Sambre in Belgium
under license from Fuchs. The unique feature of this finger shaft furnace is that 20–50% of the
charge can be liquid iron with a carbon content of 4%. The operation utilizes the Paul Wurth pro-
prietary hot metal charging system.118
This operation utilizes four water-cooled billets as the bottom electrode. The hot metal charging
system is a technology developed by Paul Wurth based on trials conducted at various ISCOR facil-
ities in South Africa. Hot metal is charged through a side launder in the furnace as shown in Fig.
10.86. This system allows for continuous charging of 44–60 tons of hot metal to the furnace over
a period of 15–20 minutes. The furnace is located within an enclosure to minimize fume emissions
to the shop. Fig. 10.87 shows the hot metal ladle charging system operating sequence
Reported consumption figures at Cockerill Sambre are reported in Table 10.23.

10.9.7 Consteel Process
The Consteel process was developed by Intersteel Technology Inc. which is located in Charlotte,
North Carolina. This is another process that is based on recovering heat from the offgas. In this

case, the scrap enters a long preheater tunnel and is preheated by the offgas as it travels to the fur-
nace. The scrap is moved through the tunnel on a conveyor and is fed continuously to the EAF. The
offgas flows counter-current to the scrap. The EAF maintains a liquid heel following tapping. Fig.
10.88 illustrates the key system components.
10.9.7.1 Historical Development
The Nucor Steel Corporation was the first company to commit to an industrial application of the
Consteel technology. In 1985 Consteel was retrofitted into an existing Nucor plant located in
Darlington, South Carolina. Due to space restrictions the installation was designed with a 90° bend
in the scrap conveyor and a relatively short preheater section. This was reported to result in scrap
feeding and preheating problems. The unit was operated for eighteen months and was then shut
down.
Several key concepts were confirmed by this prototype which was put into operation in 1987. A
consistent heel of hot metal acted as a thermal flywheel, increasing efficiencies of scrap melting.
It was demonstrated that keeping the bath temperature within a proper range ensured a constant
equilibrium between metal and slag and a continuous carbon boil, which resulted in a bath which
was homogeneous in temperature and composition. The foaming of the slag could be continuously
and precisely controlled and was very important for successful operation.
The first greenfield demonstration of the Consteel process was at AmeriSteel in Charlotte, North
Carolina. This layout included a new meltshop that was built parallel to an existing one. In this case
the continuous scrap feed system and the scrap preheater were all in line. The scrap was taken from

railcars to a loading station through a preheater to a connecting car and then into the furnace. The
preheater design included an afterburner for control of carbon monoxide emissions though this fea-
ture was never put into operation. The scrap preheater was designed to heat scrap up to 700°C.
Particular emphasis was placed on providing a tight seal on the scrap preheater. This was accom-
plished by providing a water seal in the preheater. The key characteristics of this facility have been
described.119
The Contifeeding system consists of three conveyors in cascade, each 1.5 metres (5 ft.)3 0.3
metres (1 ft.) deep 3 60 metres (200 ft.) long. A refractory lined tunnel covers the conveyor and a
water seal prevents outside air from leaking between the cover and the conveyor pans. Shredder
scrap, #1 scrap, turnings and light structural scrap are charged to the furnace on the conveyor. A
leveller bar at the scrap charge end maintains a maximum scrap height of 0.45 metres (18 in.) on
the conveyor.
The scrap preheater is 24 metres (80 ft.) in length with 60 natural gas burners of 7.0 Nm3/min. (250
scfm) capacity mounted in the preheater roof. Preheat temperatures up to 700°C are achieved using
the furnace offgas and the burners. The burners were later removed as sufficient preheating was
achieved using only furnace offgas.
The furnace proper is a 75 ton EBT EAF designed to tap 40 tons and retain a 30–35 ton heel. The
scrap feed rate is approximately 680 kg/min. (1500 lbs/min.). For cold startup the furnace is top
charged and this charge is melted in to provide the liquid heel; a slag door burner is used to accel-
erate meltdown for these heats. Electrical energy is supplied by a 30 MVA transformer through 20
inch electrodes, with resultant tap-to-tap times of approximately 45 minutes. Other facilities
include carbon and oxygen bath injection for producing a foamy slag and a pneumatic lime injec-
tion system.
In addition to the operation at AmeriSteel, several other plants have installed Consteel at their facil-
ities including Kyoei Steel (Nagoya), Nucor Steel Darlington and New Jersey Steel.
10.9.7.2 Key Operating Considerations
The key to obtaining good operating results with Consteel is based on controlling several operat-
ing parameters simultaneously. These are bath temperature, scrap feed rate and scrap composition,
oxygen injection rate, bath carbon levels, and slag composition.
It can be seen that any type of imbalance in any of these operating parameters will have a ripple
effect through the whole process. Generally, the hot heel size is 1.4 tons times the power input in
MW. Some operations use process models to track the process inputs. Slag composition is very
important because without good slag foaming it will be difficult to bury the arc. This will result in
large heat losses and potentially furnace damage. Continuous evolution of CO from the bath is cru-
cial to maintaining scrap preheat temperatures. Approximately 70–75% of the CO generated in the
furnace is available as fuel in the preheater. A reducing atmosphere is maintained in the first 30%
of the preheater in order to control scrap oxidation. Complete combustion of CO and VOCs evolv-
ing from the scrap is achieved prior to the fluegas exiting the preheater. The FeO content of the slag
is maintained around 15% which is suitable for good slag foaming.
A variety of scrap types can be fed to the Consteel operation. The primary stipulation is that the
size is less than the conveyor width in order to minimize scrap bridging in the feed system. Bundles
can be used but will not benefit from preheating. Best results are obtained when using loose, shred-
ded scrap which is light and has a large surface area for heat transfer from the hot offgases. High
carbon scrap such as pig iron can be used but must be distributed within the charge in order to
maintain a fairly uniform carbon level in the bath. HBI can be charged to the preheater along with
scrap. DRI should only be charged into the section of the preheater with a reducing atmosphere.
The key to good operation in all cases is to maintain homogeneity of the scrap feed so that bath
composition remains within preset limits. Scrap density must also be optimized so that the desired
residence time in the preheater shaft can be attained thus ensuring sufficient preheating of the
scrap. Charge permeability also affects the amount of preheat achieved.

10.9.8 Twin Shell Electric Arc Furnace
10.9.8.1 Historical Development
One of the new technologies that seems to be generating much interest is the twin shell furnace.
Essentially this technology is similar to conventional scrap preheating with the exception that scrap
preheating actually takes place in a furnace shell as opposed to a scrap bucket.
The original work done on in-furnace scrap preheating was in Sweden, where SKF operated an
installation which had a single power supply and two furnace shells. In the early 1980s Nippon
Steel developed a twin shell process for the production of stainless steel, Fig. 10.89. At the current
time, several furnace manufacturers are producing twin shell furnaces. The key goals of a twin
shell operation are equal to those of other developing technologies, but in addition the cycle times
are similar to those for BOF operations due to the minimization of power-off times.

10.9.8.2 Process Description
This type of operation consists of two furnace shells and one set of electrode arms that are used
alternately on one shell and then the other. The scrap is charged to the shell that is not melting and
the scrap is preheated by the offgas from the melting furnace. Supplemental burner heat can also
be used. The result is that the scrap is preheated in the furnace prior to melting. The more the scrap
is preheated, the greater the energy savings.
Some early designs proposed a gantry that moved along a rail from one shell to the other. Most
designs now use a furnace roof and electrode arms that can swing between two positions for the
shells. Generally a twin shell installation will consist of two identical vessels with a lower shell, an
upper shell and a roof and one set of electrode arms and lifting supports with one conventional
power supply.
It is interesting to note that several of the recent orders for twin shell installations have opted for
DC operation. This obviously has some inherent benefits as there is only one electrode arm to
rotate between the two operating positions. Another variation introduced is that some operations
have an electrode mast and arm for each furnace and have swithgear allowing the sharing of a com-
mon transformer.
There have been several operating modes suggested for the twin shell operation. The Nippon Steel
operating cycle consists generally of two phases; scrap preheating and melting. The furnace is only
charged one time and thus the heat size is smaller than the actual capacity of the furnace. In the
case of the Nippon Steel installation at POSCO, the operation is a two charge operation where 60%
of the total charge is preheating during the melting phase on the second furnace. Thus the second
charge (40% of the total) is not preheated in the furnace.
The operating cycle proposed by Clecim is similar to that at POSCO. The Mannesmann Demag
operating cycle is quite different in that the operation uses two charges but the power is alternated
between furnaces between charges. Thus one furnace melts its first charge while the other preheats
its first charge. Once the first charge is melted, the second charge is dropped and the power is
diverted to the first preheated charge. Thus the second charge is preheated as well as the first dur-
ing the preheating cycle for the second charge; oxygen lancing or oxy-fuel burners can also be used
to accelerate preheating and melting. This operating method maximizes the recovery of heat from
the offgas but requires very precise process control to keep from freezing the molten heel in the
furnace during the preheat phase.
10.9.8.3 Operating Results
10.9.8.3.1 Nippon Steel
In this operation, there is only one charge per heat. While one charge is
being melted, a second charge is being heated in the second shell. Combustion gas from a burner
on the second shell is mixed with offgas from the first shell to give a constant temperature of
1650°F for preheating in the second vessel. The remaining offgas from both shells is used to pre-
heat scrap in a scrap bucket. The net electrical power input requirement is reported at 260 kWh/ton
which is 29% lower than for the two conventional furnaces that were replaced by the twin shell
operation.
10.9.8.3.2 Davy-Clecim
The Clecim installation at Unimetal Gandrange tapped its first heat in July
1994. This twin shell operation is DC with the Clecim water-cooled billet bottom electrode. The
shells have a nominal capacity of 165 tons with a nominal diameter of 7.3 metres. Each shell has
a working volume of approximately 200 m3 which enables the furnace to operate with a single
charge each heat. The rated installed transformer capacity is 150 MVA. The maximum secondary
voltage is 850V. Maximum power input is 110 MW. Each shell has four bottom billet electrodes.
The graphite electrode swings between the two furnaces as required. Each shell has a manipulator
with consumable oxygen and carbon injection lances. Initially, integrated steelmaking operations
continued to operate which led to large furnace delays due to the logistics of movements within the

shop. This operation experienced problems with arc flare due to the configuration of the anode bus
tubes. The configuration was altered and this problem was eliminated.
The ProfilArbed installation started up at the end of 1994 and is shown in Fig. 10.90.
Several recent North American twin shell installations include Steel Dynamics, Gallatin Steel,
Tuscaloosa Steel and Nucor-Berkeley. Fig. 10.91 shows the operation at Tuscaloosa Steel.

10.9.9 Processes Under Development
Based on the success of several of the scrap preheat technologies (Consteel, Fuchs Shaft Furnace,
EOF), several new shaft type technologies are currently in the development stage. These are out-
lined in this section.
10.9.9.1 Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI)
IHI is currently developing a shaft type preheat furnace based on twin electrode DC technology.
The first commercial installation has started up at the Utsunomiya plant of Tokyo Steel. The DC
furnace itself is oval in shape with two graphite electrodes and two bottom electrodes consisting of
conductive hearth brick (as per ABB’s DC furnace design). There are two DC power supplies which
are individually controlled. The power feeding bus is arranged so that the two arcs will deflect
towards the center of the furnace, thus the energy of the arcs will be concentrated at the center of
the furnace and the thermal load to the furnace walls will be low compared to a conventional fur-
nace. As a result refractory walls are used instead of water-cooled panels thus reducing heat loss.
Scrap is charged to the furnace between the electrodes. The furnace will maintain a large hot heel
(110 ton heel, 140 ton tap weight) so that uniform operating conditions can be maintained (similar
to the Consteel concept). Steel is
tapped out periodically via a bottom
taphole in the furnace. A diagram of
the furnace is given in Fig. 10.92.
The scrap charging system consists
of two main components, the preheat
chamber and the charging equip-
ment. The scrap is fed into the upper
part of the chamber from a receiving
hopper. The exhaust gas from the fur-
nace flows up through the chamber,
preheating the scrap. In the pilot
plant, scrap preheat temperatures as
high as 800°C were achieved. Gas
exit temperatures from the chamber
were as low as 200°C. At the base of
the preheat chamber are two pushers.
These operate in two stages, allowing
scrap to feed into the furnace at a
constant rate. Offgas leaves the top of
the preheat chamber and flows to a
bag filter. Some gas can be recycled
to the furnace to regulate the inlet gas
temperature to the preheater.
10.9.9.1.1 Operation
Scrap is fed con-
tinuously to the furnace until the
desired bath weight is achieved. This
is followed by a short refining 
or heating period leading to tapping
of the heat. Power input is expected
to be almost uniform throughout 
the heat. Most furnace operations
will be fully automated. Charging of
scrap into the preheater will be fully
automated based on the scrap height

slag.
The results presented in Table 10.25 have been reported for the IHI shaft furnace.121
10.9.9.2 VAI Comelt
VAI has been working on a new furnace design they call Comelt. This furnace features a shaft and
four individually moveable graphite electrodes which protrude into the furnace at an angle. A bot-
tom anode is installed in the hearth center. The power supply is DC. The lower part of the shaft con-
tains openings for lime and coke additions via a bin system. The upper part of the shaft contains a
lateral door for scrap charging and an opening through which the furnace offgases flow. Scrap is
charged to the shaft via a conveyor belt.
The furnace consists of a tiltable furnace vessel and a fixed shaft which are connected with a mov-
able shaft ring. The furnace employs eccentric bottom tapping. The whole vessel structure rests on
a tiltable support frame. The upper part of the vessel, the shaft and shaft ring are all lined with
water-cooled panels. The shaft is enclosed with a steel structure which sits on a carriage. The shaft
can be moved off the furnace shell via this carriage. The shaft ring provides a tight connection
between the furnace vessel and the shaft. Key furnace components are shown in Fig. 10.93.

10.9.9.2.1 Process Description
Following tapping, the furnace is charged through the shaft with up
to 80% of the total charge weight, lime and carbon. After charging, the charging door in the top of
the shaft is closed and the electrodes are moved into working position. Oxy-fuel door burners are
used to clear an area for insertion of oxygen lances which immediately begin to inject oxygen into
the heel. Additional lances higher up in the furnace provide post-combustion oxygen. As the scrap
melts in and the shaft begins to empty, additional scrap is fed to the shaft. The electrode arrange-
ment allows the flow of gases to penetrate down into the scrap and then rise up through the scrap
column thus maximizing heat recovery.
VAI has projected that the capital cost for Comelt will be greater than that for an equivalent DC
operation for small to medium heat sizes. This is due to the large investment required for the elec-
trical systems for the electrodes. For large heat sizes however, the projections indicate that Comelt
should be less expensive than conventional DC technology.122
Though this process is still in the pilot plant stage, projections indicate that this furnace will have
lower power (304 kWh/ton liquid) and electrode (0.8 kg/ton) consumption than either conventional
AC or DC furnaces.122
10.9.9.3 Mannesmann Demag Huettentechnik Conarc
The MDH Conarc is based on an operation which combines converter and EAF technologies,
namely a converter arc furnace. This technology is based on the growing use of hot metal in the
EAF and is aimed at optimizing energy recovery and maximizing productivity in such an opera-
tion. The use of hot metal in the EAF is limited by the maximum oxygen blowing rates which are
dependent in turn on furnace size. The basic concept of Conarc is to carry out decarburization in
one vessel and electric melting in another vessel. The Conarc system consists of two furnace shells,
one slewable electrode structure serving both shells, one electric power supply for both shells, and
one slewable top oxygen lance serving both shells
Thus one shell operates in the converter mode using the top lance while the other shell operates in
the arc furnace mode. The first order for a Conarc was placed by Nippon Dendro Ispat, Dolvi,
India. This operation will be based on the use of hot metal, scrap, DRI and pig iron. Projections for
this operation are an energy consumption below 181 kWh/ton when operating primarily with hot
metal and DRI. Once complete, this facility will contain two independent twin shell furnaces each
with a tap weight of 164 tons. Fig. 10.94 shows the key system components for a Conarc facility.
A Conarc has also been ordered for the Saldahna Steel facility which is being built in Saldahna
Bay, South Africa. This operation will be based on 45% Corex hot metal and 55% DRI feed to the
furnaces. Hot metal will be charged to one shell and the top lance will be used for decarburization.
Simultaneously, DRI will be added to recover the heat generated. Once the aim carbon level is
achieved, the electrodes will be moved to this shell and additional DRI will be fed to make up the
balance of the heat.
Large quantities of heat are generated during the oxygen blowing cycle. As a result it is important
that charge materials be added during this period so that some of this energy can be recovered. This
will also help to protect the furnace shell from overheating.
10.9.9.4 Mannesmann Demag Huettentechnik Contiarc 
The Contiarc EAF is a technology that has been proposed by MDH. It is based on a stationary ring
shaft furnace with a centrally located DC arc heating system. Scrap is fed continuously by con-
veyor to the ring shaft. There the scrap is picked up by a series of magnets and is distributed evenly
throughout the ring shaft area. The magnet train runs on a circular track below the furnace roof.
Fig. 10.95 shows the main components of the Contiarc.
The scrap settles in the ring shaft and is preheated as furnace offgas rises up through the furnace.
The descending scrap column is monitored using a level measuring system. If the charge sinks
unevenly, additional scrap is fed to the lower points to restore an even scrap height profile. Scrap

is always present to protect the furnace walls so the arc can run continuously at maximum power
without fear of damage to the furnace sidewalls.
The graphite electrode is located in a protective inner vessel to protect it from falling scrap. The
inner vessel has a wear guard and a cooling water system in the lower hot zone. An electrically
insulated ceramic electrode bushing is provided at the point where the electrode penetrates out into
the furnace. Electrode regulation is performed hydraulically.
Chemical energy input, such as burners, is highly efficient because gas residence times in the
Contiarc are greater than for conventional furnaces.  Burners are located near the taphole to super-
heat the steel prior to tapping. Burners are also located near the slag door to facilitate slagging off.
Slag free tapping is performed intermittently using a syphon tapping system.
Energy efficiency is extremely high using Contiarc as heat losses to the shell are minimized due to
the continuous cover provided by the scrap. The elimination of top charging also reduces heat
losses. The furnace is essentially airtight so that all offgas rises up through the scrap and is col-
lected at the ring header at the top of the shaft. Dust losses are reduced 40% over conventional EAF
operations as the scrap acts as a filter, trapping the dust as the offgas rises through the scrap. MDH
projections indicate that the total energy input requirement for Contiarc will be only 62% of that
required by an equivalent conventional EAF operation.123
10.9.9.5 Future Melting Furnace Design
Without doubt, current trends in EAF design indicate that high levels of both electrical and chem-
ical energy are likely to be employed in future furnace designs. As so many have pointed out, we
are headed towards the oxy-electric furnace. The degree to which one form of energy is used over
another will be dependent on the cost and availability of the various energy forms in a particular
location. Raw materials and their cost will also affect the choice of energy source. The use of alter-
native iron sources containing high levels of carbon will necessitate the use of high oxygen blow-
ing rates which equate to high levels of chemical energy use. A word of caution is in order though
for such operations, as some thought must enter into how to maximize energy recovery from the
offgases generated. In addition, high levels of materials such as cold pig iron can sometimes lead
to extended tap-to-tap times which will reduce furnace productivity. If hot metal is used, some
method must be provided to recover energy from the offgases. Materials which are also high in sil-
icon will provide additional energy to the bath but at the cost of additional flux requirements and
greater slag quantities generated.
A closed furnace design appears to be imperative for complete control of reactions in the furnace
freeboard. Minimization of the offgas volume exiting the furnace will help to minimize offgas sys-
tem requirements. If air infiltration is eliminated, offgas temperatures will be quite high which will
give more efficient heat transfer in scrap preheating operations. If high levels of hydrogen and CO
are present in the cooled gas, it could be used as a low grade fuel. Alternatively, if the CO is post-
combusted in several preheater stages, maximum energy recovery to the scrap could be achieved.
The main disadvantage to operation of a closed furnace is that conventional oxygen lancing and
coal injection operations would be difficult to carry out. These can however be carried out in a
closed furnace if a series of submerged and side injectors are installed in the furnace shell and side-
walls similar to those used in conventional BOFs. The required injection rates would likely require
that the furnace bath depth be increased in order to minimize blow through. A deeper bath with
intense mixing will be beneficial for slag bath mixing which should improve steel quality and max-
imize recovery of iron units. Generation of CO in the bath will help to flush nitrogen and hydro-
gen out of the bath.
Some form of scrap preheating should be utilized to recover heat from the offgas. The best method
for scrap preheating is still under debate but staged preheating coupled with post-combustion in
each stage could help to minimize the need for a secondary post-combustion system downstream
in the offgas system.

If a slanted electrode configuration similar to that used in Comelt is employed, it would be con-
ceivable to retract the electrodes if necessary during part of the tap-to-tap cycle. This would allow
preheated scrap to be charged periodically if a finger type preheat shaft were used. Alternatively
the scrap could be continuously charged into a shaft by conveyor or a preheat tunnel conveyor sim-
ilar to that used in Consteel, could be installed. A DC arc could be directed at the point where scrap
feed falls into the furnace similar to the IHI furnace concept. This would help to maximize heat
transfer from the arc to the scrap. If a scrap buildup on the walls of the furnace can be maintained,
heat losses to the furnace shell can also be minimized.
10.9.9.6 Conclusions
There are many new processes for steelmaking which are now being commercialized. In almost all
cases the goal is to minimize the electrical energy input and to maximize the energy efficiency in
the process. Thus several technologies have attempted to maximize the use of chemical energy into
the process (EOF, K-ES, LSF, etc.). These processes are highly dependent on achieving a pseudo-
equilibrium where oxygen has completely reacted with fuel components (carbon, CO, natural gas,
etc.) to give the maximum achievable energy input to the process. Other processes have attempted
to maximize the use of the energy that is input to the furnace by recovering energy in the offgases
(Fuchs shaft furnace, Consteel, EOF, IHI Shaft). These processes are highly dependent on good
heat transfer from the offgas to the scrap. This requires that the scrap and the offgas contact each
other in an optimal way.
All of these processes have been able to demonstrate some benefits. The key is to develop a process
that will show process and environmental benefits without having a high degree of complexity and
without affecting productivity. There is no perfect solution that will meet the needs of all steel-
making operations. Rather, steelmakers must prioritize their objectives and then match these to the
attributes of various furnace designs. It is important to maintain focus on the following criteria:
1. To provide process flexibility.
2. To increase productivity while improving energy efficiency.
3. To improve the quality of the finished product.
4. To meet environmental requirements at a minimum cost.
With these factors in mind, the following conclusions are drawn :
1. The correct furnace selection will be one that meets the specific requirements of the
individual facility. Factors entering into the decision will likely include availability
of raw materials, availability and cost of energy sources, desired product mix, level
of post furnace treatment/refining available, capital cost and availability of a trained
workforce.
2. Various forms of energy input should be balanced in order to give the operation the max-
imum amount of flexibility. This will help to minimize energy costs in the long run, i.e.
the capability of running with high electrical input and low oxygen or the converse.
3. Energy input into the furnace needs to be well distributed in order to minimize total
energy requirements. Good mixing of the bath will help to achieve this goal.
4. Oxygen injection should be distributed evenly throughout the tap-to-tap cycle in
order to minimize fluctuations in offgas temperature and composition. Thus post-
combustion operations can be optimized and the size of the offgas system can be
minimized. In addition, fume generation will be minimized and slag/bath approach
to equilibrium will be greater.
5. Injection of solids into the bath and into the slag layer should be distributed across
the bath surface in order to maximize the efficiency of slag foaming operations.
This will also enable the slag and bath to move closer to equilibrium. This in turn
will help to minimize flux requirements and will improve the quality of the steel.

6. Submerged injection of both gases and solids should be maximized so that the ben-
eficial effects of bath stirring can be realized. Slag fluxes could be injected along
with oxygen. The high temperatures achieved in the fireball coupled with the high
oxygen potential will help the lime flux into the slag faster, and as a result, dephos-
phorization and desulfurization operations can proceed more optimally.
7. If injection of solids and gases is increased, it will likely be beneficial to increase
the bath depth. This will also be beneficial for steel quality. For operations using
high levels of solids injection (those feeding high levels of iron carbide), a deeper
bath will help to reduce blow through (solids exiting the bath) and could also allow
higher injection rates.
8. The melting vessel should be closed up as much as possible in order to minimize
the amount of air infiltration. This will minimize the volume of offgas exiting the
furnace leading to smaller fume system requirements. In the case of post-combus-
tion operations coupled with scrap preheating, the gas volume will be minimized
while maximizing offgas temperature for efficient heat transfer to the scrap. If sec-
ondary post-combustion is required it can be achieved most effectively at minimum
cost by minimizing the volume of offgas to be treated.
9. If high carbon alternative iron sources are used as feed in scrap melting operations,
some form of post-combustion is imperative in order to recover energy from the
high levels of CO contained in the offgas. For these operations, energy recovery will
likely be maximized by coupling post-combustion with some form of scrap pre-
heating.
10. Scrap preheating provides the most likely option for heat recovery from the offgas.
For processes using a high degree of chemical energy in the furnace, this becomes
even more important, as more energy is contained in the offgas for these operations.
In order to maximize recovery of chemical energy contained in the offgas, it will be
necessary to perform post-combustion. Achieving high post-combustion efficien-
cies throughout the heat will be difficult. Staged post-combustion in scrap preheat
operations could optimize heat recovery further.
11. Alternatively, operations which generate high levels of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide may find it cost effective to try to recover the calorific energy contained
in the offgas in the same manner as some BOF operations which cool and clean the
gas prior to using it as a low grade fuel. For this type of operation, it will be neces-
sary to operate with a closed furnace. To minimize fuel gas storage requirements,
generation of CO in the furnace should be balanced throughout the cycle. This can
be achieved by using side shell or bottom oxygen injectors and by injecting oxygen
at constant levels throughout the heat. If this form of operation is coupled with scrap
preheating, any VOCs resulting from the scrap will form part of the offgas stream.
A greater scrap column height can be utilized because secondary post-combustion
downstream in the offgas system is not necessary. The high scrap column will also
help strip the fume and dust from the offgas stream thus minimizing cleaning
requirements. The resulting fume system requirement will be considerably smaller
than that for a conventional furnace with similar melting capacity.
12. In the future, it will likely be necessary to recycle furnace dust and mill scale back
into the steelmaking vessel. Preliminary trials indicate that this material is a good
slag foaming agent. Key drawbacks are handling the dust prior to recycle and its
concentration buildup of zinc and lead over time.
13. Twin shell furnace configurations will continue to be used in order to reduce cycle
times below 45 minutes (comparable to BOF operations) and to optimize power-on
time. In the case of operations using a high percentage of hot metal, operations sim-
ilar to Conarc will be used, thus employing oxygen blowing into a hot heel with

scrap addition. Thought must be given to maximizing recovery of energy from the
hot offgases generated during periods of high oxygen injection rates.
14. The use of hot metal in the EAF will increase as more high tonnage EAF operations
attempt to achieve cycle times of 35–40 minutes. Hot metal should be added to the
heat gradually so that large fluctuations in the bath chemistry do not occur which
could result in explosions. In addition, high decarburization efficiency can be
achieved if the bath carbon level is kept at approximately 0.3% until final refining
takes place (blowing down the desired tap carbon level at the end of the heat).
Decarburizing from high carbon levels has been shown to generate high iron losses
to fuming. At very low bath carbon levels, large amounts of FeO are generated and
report to the slag.
15. DC furnaces will continue to be of interest for high efficiency melting operations.
The additional space available on the furnace roof due to a single electrode opera-
tion will allow for much greater automation of operating functions such as bath
sampling, temperature sampling, solids/gas injection, etc. The concept of using side
slanted electrodes as in the case of Comelt affords several advantages to furnace
operation and could allow for electrodes to be retracted in some phases of the of the
tap-to-tap period. This would allow scrap to be charged from a preheating shaft
without fear of electrode damage. The use of DC furnaces might also allow for
smaller furnace diameters coupled with greater bath depth.
16. Operations which desire maximum flexibility at minimum cost will result in more
hybrid furnace designs. These designs will take into account flexibility in feed
materials and will continue to aim for high energy efficiency coupled with high pro-
ductivity. For example operations with high solids injection, iron carbide or DRI
fines, may choose designs which would increase the flat bath period in order to
spread out the solids injection cycle. Alternatively, a deeper bath may be used so
that higher injection rates can be used without risk of blow through.
17. Operating practices will continue to evolve and will not only seek to optimize
energy efficiency in the EAF but will seek to discover the overall optimum for the
whole steelmaking facility. Universally, the most important factor is to optimize
operating costs for the entire facility and not necessarily one operation in the over-
all process chain.
Along with added process flexibility comes greater process complexity. This in turn will require
greater process understanding so that the process may be better controlled. Much more thought
consequently must enter into the selection of electric furnace designs and it can be expected that
many new designs will result in the years ahead. As long as there is electric furnace steelmaking,
the optimal design will always be strived for.

The treatment of steel in the ladle started approximately 45 years ago when the first ladle-to-ladle
and ladle-to-ingot mold vacuum degassing processes for hydrogen removal appeared on the
scene. In the late 1950s more efficient vacuum degassers such as the Dortmund Hoerder (DH)
and Ruhrstahl-Heraeus (RH) processes became popular. In the middle 1960s degassing processes
such as vacuum arc degassing (VAD), the ASEA-SKF process, and the vacuum oxygen decar-
burization (VOD) process for treating high-chromium steels were successfully implemented.
Converter processes such as the argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) process were introduced in
the early 1970s. The AOD process is now the preferred route in many specialty steel and stain-
less steel shops.
Granulated flux injection into the liquid steel, combined with argon stirring, started in the early
1970s. This was soon followed by the application of cored-wire feeding of alloying elements for
better control of composition and inclusion morphology. A good overview of the various devel-
opments was given by Nijhawan1, while an extensive review of the thermodynamic and kinetic
principles underlying the various secondary steelmaking processes was prepared by Lange.32
All the aforementioned innovations have had a pronounced effect on the steelmaking process,
particularly with respect to the vessel or the furnace in which the steel is produced. For exam-
ple, the implementation of ladle metallurgy and its related aspects enabled electric furnace steel-
makers to use their furnaces as fast melters without the need to perform any refining in the
furnace. In addition, ladle refining and degassing make it possible for the steelmaker to exert
much tighter control over the properties of the final product through improved accuracy in the
composition of the final product as well as its cleanliness and by being able to control inclusion
morphology.
The contents of this chapter are arranged according to the sequence of operations in a steelmak-
ing shop, i.e. starting with tapping the furnace, followed by reheating, refining, inclusion modi-
fication and degassing. Where appropriate, the underlying metallurgical principles of each
operation will be discussed in terms of reaction equilibria and kinetics as well as fluid dynamics.
In preparing this chapter frequent reference has been made to a recently published book by
Turkdogan.2

11.1 Tapping the Steel
11.1.1 Reactions Occurring During Tapping
During tapping of the steel, air bubbles are entrained into the steel where the tap stream enters the
bath in the tap ladle. The quantity of air entrained into the steel increases with the increasing free
fall height of the tap stream as was demonstrated with the aid of water model studies.2 The entrain-
ment of a gas such as air into a falling stream of liquid steel has been the subject of a number of
studies.3–6 However, a reliable prediction of the quantity of air entrained into a stream of liquid
steel during tapping is difficult because of the assumptions that have to be made.
The nitrogen contained in the air entrained by the steel will be absorbed by the liquid steel depend-
ing on the extent to which the reaction 
(11.1.1)
will proceed to the right; the symbol within the square brackets refers to nitrogen dissolved in the
steel. It is well-known that surface active solutes such as oxygen and sulfur impede the kinetics of
nitrogen absorption by the steel. The higher the concentration of dissolved oxygen and/or sulfur, the
lower is the extent of nitrogen absorption. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.1 where the effect of deoxi-
dation practice on the nitrogen pickup during tapping of an electric furnace is shown.7 For deoxi-
dized steels the average nitrogen pickup during tap is significantly higher than for non-deoxidized
steels. The same effect is shown in Fig. 11.2 where the nitrogen pickup during tapping of 220 tonne
oxygen converter heats is depicted as a function of the dissolved oxygen content for steels contain-
ing approximately 0.01% sulfur.2 The data in Fig. 11.1 and Fig. 11.2 are in complete accord.
Other sources contributing to the nitrogen pickup during or shortly after tap are: petroleum coke,
when used for recarburization and various ferroalloys, particularly ferrotitanium, ferrovanadium
and low and medium-carbon ferrochromium.
Ladle additions often contain moisture which reacts with the liquid steel according to the follow-
ing reaction:

It is seen from this equation that
the extent of hydrogen pickup
will be more pronounced for a
fully deoxidized steel in which
the dissolved oxygen content is
low.
Of the various ferroalloys, fer-
romanganese is probably the
major contributor of hydrogen. 
11.1.2 Furnace Slag
Carryover
It is generally unavoidable that a
quantity of furnace slag is car-
ried over into the tap ladle dur-
ing tapping. The furnace slag
generally contains a high con-
centration of FeO and MnO and
therefore (in an untreated form) is not suitable for use as a refining slag. Accordingly, methods to
minimize the amount of furnace slag carryover have been developed and implemented; Szekely et
al. discuss various methods for BOFs and EAFs.8 These include locating the taphole in the barrel
of the converter sometimes in conjunction with the use of a ceramic sphere to block off the taphole
towards the end of tap. In electric arc furnaces the first improvement was the use of submerged tap-
holes, later followed by the widespread implementation of eccentric bottom tapholes, which are
now common in modern arc furnaces.
In older shops, inadequately equipped to control furnace slag carryover, slag raking is often prac-
ticed to remove the furnace slag. A good slag-free surface is attainable by careful raking. According
to Hoeffken et al. raking is usually accompanied by a temperature loss of approximately 2.5°C
(~5°F) per minute of treatment time and a metal loss of approximately 0.2%,9 raking times are typ-
ically of the order of ten minutes. For best results it is recommended that the steel be tapped open,
then raked and covered with the synthetic ladle slag and finally deoxidized. 
As a result of furnace slag carryover into the tap ladle, oxidation of aluminum and silicon present
in the ladle additions occurs through reactions with less stable oxides (e.g. iron oxide and man-
ganese oxide) present in the furnace slag. Another consequence of furnace slag carryover is phos-
phorus reversion from the slag to the steel, particularly when the steel is fully deoxidized.
To be able to predict the aluminum and silicon losses as well as the anticipated degree of phospho-
rus reversion, it is necessary to know the quantity of furnace slag carried over into the tap ladle.
Kracich et al. describe a sensor to measure the depth of the slag layer in a ladle.10 These data provide
accurate feedback to the melter and assist him in controlling the amount of furnace slag carryover.
11.1.2.1 Aluminum and Silicon Losses
The reactions of aluminum and silicon dissolved in the steel with the iron and manganese oxide in
the slag and with the fallen converter skull may be represented by the following general reaction:
(11.1.3)
Using average molecular masses and assuming 80% Fe3O4 for the composition of the skull,
Turkdogan11 derived the following approximate emperical relation for the percentages of alu-
minum and silicon lost to the ladle slag for a 200 tonne steel bath in the ladle:

where Wfs and Wsk are the weights (kg) of the carried over furnace slag and the fallen converter
skull, respectively and D(FeO + %MnO) is the decrease in oxide contents of the furnace slag dur-
ing tapping.
11.1.2.2 Phosphorus Reversion
Furnace slag carryover generally results in phosphorus reversion from the slag to the steel, partic-
ularly when the steel is fully deoxidized. The general relationship for the increase in steel phos-
phorus content, D[%P], as a result of reversion from the slag is:
(11.1.5)
where (%P) is the phosphorus content of the furnace slag and Wfs and Wb are the weights of the
carried-over furnace slag and the steel bath in the ladle, respectively.
For OBM (Q-BOP) heats and low-carbon heats made in EAFs with oxygen injection, typical val-
ues for (%P) and D[%P] are approximately 0.3 and 0.003, respectively.11,12 Substitution of these
values into equation 11.1.5 gives Wfs/Wb ø0.01. In other words, when proper measures are taken
to prevent excessive furnace slag carryover, the average quantity of carried-over converter or fur-
nace slag is approximately 1% of the steel tapped. This quantity of slag carried over during tapping
corresponds to a slag thickness in a 200 tonne ladle of 5.5 ± 3 cm, in general agreement with plant
observations.11
Hoeffken et al.9 observed that phosphorus reversion is more likely to occur when both the basi-
city, %CaO/%SiO2, of the carryover slag is approximately 2 or lower and its iron oxide content is
approximately 17% or lower. For iron oxide contents of approximately 25% or higher the phos-
phorus reversion is noticeably less, provided the slag basicity exceeds 2–2.5.
For heats that are tapped open, to which only ferromanganese and a small amount of aluminum are
added, the steel is not sufficiently deoxidized to cause phosphorus reversion. In fact, in some cases
of tapping open heats to which 0.3–0.6% manganese is added, the phosphorus content of the steel
decreases by approximately 0.001% due to mixing of the carried-over furnace slag with the steel
during tapping.11
11.1.3 Chilling Effect of Ladle Additions
Ferroalloys and fluxes added to the steel in the tap ladle affect the temperature of the steel in the
ladle, usually resulting in a decrease in temperature. The effect of various alloying additions,
including coke, on the change in temperature of the steel for an average bath temperature of
1650°C (3002°F) is summarized in Table 11.1. These data were calculated from the heat capacities
and heats of solution of the various solutes.
It can be seen from Table 11.1 that ferrosilicon is the only ferroalloy that, upon addition, does not
result in a decrease in steel bath temperature; in fact, the use of FeSi (75%) results in an increase

in temperature. This is a consequence of the fact that the dissolution of silicon into liquid iron is
exothermic, i.e. heat is liberated. Although FeSi (75%) usually costs more per unit weight of con-
tained silicon than FeSi (50%), the use of the former material can be justified under certain con-
ditions, particularly when relatively large quantities must be added and when the shop has no or
limited reheating facilities such as ladle furnaces.
For aluminum-killed steels, the exothermic heat of the deoxidation reaction must be taken into
account when calculating the effect of an aluminum addition to the tap ladle on the change in steel
temperature. For example, when a steel containing 600 ppm of dissolved oxygen is deoxidized with
aluminum, the heat generated by the deoxidation reaction results in a change in steel temperature
of +19°C (+34°F). In other words, when the steel in the tap ladle is deoxidized with aluminum, the
decrease in steel temperature as a result of tapping will be less by 19°C (34°F).
Flux and slag conditioner additions decrease the temperature of the steel in the ladle. The effect of
these additions on the change in steel temperature as determined from the heat capacity data is
summarized in Table 11.2.
When tapping aluminum-killed steels to which typical ladle additions of 10 kg lime and pre-fused
calcium aluminate per tonne of steel (20 lbs/ton) are made, the decrease in steel temperature dur-
ing tapping to a pre-heated ladle is 55–75°C (99–135°F). The heat loss due to the flux addition is
approximately balanced by the heat generated by the deoxidation reaction with aluminum. Thus, in
this particular practice the heat losses are almost entirely from radiation and conduction into the
ladle lining.
11.2 The Tap Ladle
11.2.1 Ladle Preheating
In most oxygen and many EAF steelmaking shops the ladle lining consists of high-alumina bricks
(70–80%Al2O3) while the slag line consists of magnesia bricks, usually containing approximately
10% carbon and small amounts of metallic additions such as aluminum, magnesium or chromium to
minimize the oxidation of carbon. For many EAF shops the lining is dolomite. The refractory mate-
rials used in tap ladles are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 and will not be discussed here further,

except to make reference to a series of
articles by Engel et al.13 which repre-
sents a comprehensive overview of
refractory materials and configurations
employed in secondary steelmaking.
The thermal properties of various
refractories used in ladles are sum-
marized in Table 11.3 and Fig. 11.3.
It is seen from Fig. 11.3 that magnesia
has a significantly higher thermal
conductivity than the other refractory
materials. Magnesia also has a higher
heat storage capacity than the other
materials as shown in Table 11.3. The
properties of dolomite are similar to
those of magnesia.
Because of the relatively high thermal
conductivity of the refractories used
in ladles, preheating of the ladle prior
to its use is required to avoid exces-
sive heat losses during tapping and
during subsequent refining opera-
tions. Tomazin et al.14 studied the
effect of ladle refractories and prac-
tices on steel temperature control and
developed a mathematical model to
simulate a ladle which is used to sup-
ply liquid steel to a continuous caster.
The model was used to evaluate the
temperature increase of the hot and cold faces of a ladle during preheating. This is shown in Fig.
11.4 from which it is seen that the temperature of the hot face increases rapidly with time. However,
the cold face temperature does not exceed 100°C (212°F) after preheating for approximately 51⁄2
hours when the ladle is cold and dry initially.
The rate of rise of temperature of the hot face depends on the distance from the ladle top to the
burner wall as well as on the thermal input from the preheater. A rapid heating rate should be
avoided for the following reasons:

(i) Rapid heating results in a non-equilibrium temperature profile, i.e. a steep tem-
perature gradient adjacent to the hot face.
(ii) Rapid heating causes extreme shell stresses.
(iii) The thermal shock resistance of the brick may not be high enough to with-
stand a rapid heating rate.
Another measure of the thermal condition of the ladle is the total heat content of the ladle brick.
As shown in Fig. 11.5, the brick continues to absorb heat at a significant rate for up to twelve hours.
At this time the ladle brick contains in excess of 90% of the maximum heat content that can be
attained once steady state has been reached after 17–18 hours of preheating.
After preheating the ladle is moved to the converter or the furnace. This causes a decrease in the tem-
perature of the hot face. The temperature decrease must be taken into account when adjusting the tap
temperature. The required adjustment in tap temperature is shown as a function of the time elapsed
between the end of preheating and the start of tapping for two hot face temperatures, Fig. 11.6.
11.2.2 Ladle Free Open Performance
Upon arrival of the ladle at the continuous caster tundish, it has to be opened to allow the steel to
flow into the tundish. When the ladle slide gate is stroked open and steel starts to flow without
operator assistance, the procedure is classified as ‘free open’. If poking or oxygen lancing is nec-

essary to open the ladle, the process is classified as ‘assisted open’. When all attempts to open the
ladle are unsuccessful, it is classified as ‘non-free open’. These classifications were taken from
Vitlip15 who undertook a comprehensive study of ladle free open performance.
According to Vitlip15 there are several factors that determine the opening performance of a ladle.
The most dominant factor is the residence time of the steel in the ladle followed by the ladle pre-
heat practice, the elapsed time between the end of stirring and the opening of the ladle at the caster,
the cycle time for an empty ladle and the argon stirring practice. The relative effect of these fac-
tors on the percentage of free open ladles is summarized in Table 11.4.
11.2.2.1 Steel Residence Time in the Ladle
The residence time in the ladle is defined as the elapsed time between tapping and the opening of
the ladle at the tundish. Under the operating conditions prevailing at the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel
Corporation this time is 80 min.15 However, longer residence times are not uncommon whenever
problems are encountered at the caster. It can be seen from Table 11.4 that a residence time in the
ladle longer than five hours results in a significant decrease in free open performance. Long resi-
dence times in the ladle cause partial sintering of the nozzle fill material due to extended exposure
to liquid steel temperatures.
11.2.2.2 Ladle Preheat Practice
The ladle preheat practices at Wheeling-Pittsburgh were examined for ladles returned to service
following repair.15 The data in Table 11.4 show that the free open performance is worse for repaired
ladles compared with those that follow the normal cycle, indicating an inadequate preheat practice
for repaired ladles.
11.2.2.3 Elapsed Time Between End of Stirring and Opening
The data in Table 11.4 show that the time elapsed between the end of stirring at the trim station and
the opening of the ladle at the tundish is important. The longer the time without stirring the worse
is the free opening performance.
11.2.2.4 Empty Ladle Cycle Time
The empty ladle cycle time is the elapsed time between closing the ladle at the caster at the end of
a cast and the time the ladle is filled again at tap. The practice at Wheeling-Pittsburgh was not to
preheat the ladles when they were being rotated between the caster and the converter. However, the
rate of rotation could vary significantly because of delays. The data in Table 11.4 show that an
empty ladle cycle time longer than two hours leads to a decrease in free open performance.
11.2.2.5 Argon Stirring Practice
Today most ladles are equipped with bottom plugs for argon bubbling. Whenever the plug is out of
commission, it may be necessary to provide the required stirring via a top lance. The data in Table
11.4 show that top stirring with argon results in a slightly decreased free open performance.

ber of other factors on free open per-
formance, the details of which may
be found in the cited reference.
11.2.3 Stirring in Ladles
To achieve a homogeneous bath tem-
perature and composition, the steel in
the ladle is most often stirred by
means of argon gas bubbling. For
moderate gas bubbling rates, e.g. less
than 0.6 Nm3/min (~20scfm) porous
refractory plugs are used, usually
mounted in the bottom of the ladle. A
schematic illustration of a porous
plug assembly in the ladle bottom is
shown in Fig. 11.7.
Anagbo and Brimacombe16 dis-
cussed some typical examples of var-
ious plugs, shown in Fig. 11.8. As
can be seen, porous plugs have either
a conical or a rectangular shape. The
conically shaped plug is easier to
change should the plug wear out
before the lining. Rectangular plugs
are geometrically compatible with
the surrounding bricks and can be
used to advantage in cases where the
plug life is comparable with that of
the lining. The performance and life
of isotropic plugs can be improved by
producing the element in two or three
components stacked together with
metal inserts.17 The primary advan-
tage of the so-called directional-
porosity or capillary plug, shown in
Fig. 11.8(e) and (f), is that the plug
can be made of the same dense
refractory as the lining brick, or even
denser. This results in increased hot
compression strength, greater resis-
tance to erosion and a longer service
life. Disadvantages of capillary plugs
are that they are more prone to infil-
tration by liquid steel upon loss of
argon gas pressure. More details
regarding the configurations of plugs
and the modeling of porous plug
operations can be found in the cited
references.16,17
Some melt shops utilize electromag-
netic induction stirring in the ladles.

Some reported features of induction stirring in the ladle include better stirring homogeneity (espe-
cially near the ladle bottom), the ability to reverse the direction of the stirring forces (useful for
alloy additions) and stirring without breaking slag cover and exposing steel to the ambient oxidiz-
ing atmosphere. These benefits are offset by the high capital cost, including ladles equipped with
stainless steel panels comprising at least 1/3 of the ladle shell and the need for auxiliary gas stir-
ring for adequate hydrogen removal.
11.2.3.1 Stirring Power and Mixing Times
Homogenization of bath temperature and composition by gas bubbling is primarily caused by the
dissipation of the buoyant energy of the injected gas. The thermodynamic relationship describing
the effective stirring power of a gas was derived by Pluschkell.18 The following equation for the
stirring power is derived from Pluschkell’s relationship:

H

The stirring time to achieve 95% homoge-
nization is defined as the mixing time t.
There have been numerous experimental and
theoretical studies dealing with mixing phe-
nomena in gas-stirred systems. Mazumdar
and Guthrie19 published a comprehensive
review on the subject. The following rela-
tionship expressing the mixing time, t, in
terms of the stirring power, «. (W/tonne),
ladle diameter, D(m), and depth of injection,
H(m), was obtained from the work of
Mazumdar and Guthrie.20
(11.2.2)
Mixing times calculated from equations
11.2.1 and 11.2.2 are shown in Fig. 11.9 for
the simplified case of D = H. The mixing
times shown in Fig. 11.9 are in good agree-
ment with those calculated from other corre-
lations.21,22 It can be seen from Fig. 11.9 that
a 200 tonne heat will be homogenized in
2–21⁄2 minutes after bubbling with argon at a
flow rate of 0.2 Nm3/min (~7 scfm).
The effect of the location of the bottom stir-
ring plug on mixing times was studied by
several authors.23,24 The general finding was
that the mixing time is decreased by placing
the bottom plug off-center, e.g. at mid-radius.

According to Mietz and Oeters23 a stirring plug placed in the center of the ladle bottom generates a
toroidal loop of metal flow in the upper part of the bath while a dead zone is created in the lower
part, resulting in longer mixing times. Eccentrically located bottom plugs give rise to extensive cir-
culation of metal throughout the entire bath, avoiding dead zones and leading to shorter mixing
times.
11.2.3.2 Slag–Metal Reaction Rates in Gas-Stirred Melts
Numerous experimental studies to investigate slag–metal gas reactions in gas-stirred ladle sys-
tems under a variety of experimental conditions have been performed. Reviews on this subject
were prepared by Mazumdar and Guthrie19, Emi25 and Asai et al.26 For most slag–metal reactions
the rates are controlled primarily by mass transfer of the reactants and products across the slag-
metal interface. In stirred systems such as a steel bath in a ladle stirred by argon, the slag–metal
interfacial area is affected by the degree of agitation in the bath which, in turn, is determined by
the stirring power.
11.2.3.2.1 Desulfurization During desulfurization of the steel in the ladle, the mixing of slag and metal
is achieved by argon bubbling and the rate of desulfurization is described by equation 2.10.19 in
Chapter 2.
The overall rate constant is related to the average mass transfer coefficient, mS, the slag–metal
interfacial area, A, and the steel both volume, V, by the following expression:
(11.2.3)
It has been shown that:
(11.2.4)
where the exponent n may vary between 0.25 and 0.30, depending on the specific system under
consideration.26
From pilot plant tests with 2.5 tonne heats26 to study desulfurization, it was found that at moder-
ate gas bubbling rates, corresponding to «. < 60 W/tonne, there was little or no slag–metal mixing,
hence the rate of desulfurization was slow. For higher stirring rates corresponding to «. > 60
W/tonne, better mixing of slag and metal was achieved and the rate constant for desulfurization
increased accordingly. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 11.10 from which
the following approximate relationships between the overall rate constant and the stirring power are
derived:
(11.2.5)
It should be stressed that these are empirical correlations. The value of ks depends on the energy dis-
sipation per unit area at the slag–metal interface, the properties of the slag and the amount of the slag. 
The abrupt change in overall rate constant for values of the stirring power at approximately 60
W/tonne is explained8 by the fact that an increase in the energy input rate results in increased emul-
sification of slag and metal, leading to an increase in interfacial area, A, which, in turn, increases kS.
11.2.3.2.2 Dephosphorization The removal of phosphorus from the steel by the ladle slag is governed
by the same rate equation as that for sulfur removal, equation 2.10.19. Thus, the overall rate con-
stant for dephosphorization is expected to have the same form as equation 11.2.4. That this is, in
fact, the case was shown by Kikuchi et al.27 who studied dephosphorization in the ladle with

CaO–CaF2–FeO slags in a 50 tonne VAD/VOD as well as in a 250 tonne ladle furnace facility. The
overall rate constant can be represented by the following approximate relationship:
(11.2.6)
This expression is similar to that for kS, valid for «. < 60 W/tonne, equation 11.2.5. It is not clear
why no abrupt change in kP was observed for «. > 60 W/tonne, as in the case of desulfurization,
Fig. 11.10.
It is interesting to note that Kim and Fruehan28 as well as Mietz et al.29 observed that mass trans-
fer between metal and slag is impeded when the stirring plug in the ladle bottom is located off-
center. A stirring plug located in the center results in increased slag–metal emulsification with
increasing gas flowrate. Eccentrically located stirring plugs create a slag-free zone, the so-called
eye, close to the ladle wall. This affects the detachment of slag particles from the main slag phase
and results in decreased emulsification.29 The ultimate choice of location of the stirring plug in the
bottom of the ladle would, therefore, appear to be determined by which aspect of stirring is more
important for a given operation: good mixing characteristics, or the ability to achieve rapid desul-
furization and/or dephosphorization. In most cases a compromise will have to be struck.
11.2.4 Effect of Stirring on Inclusion Removal
One of the objectives of stirring the steel in the ladle is the removal of non-metallic inclusions.
Nakanishi and Szekely30 studied the deoxidation kinetics of aluminum-deoxidized steels in 20 kg
melts as well as in a 50 tonne ASEA-SKF furnace. The authors developed a model for inclusion
removal based on the postulate that the decrease in total oxygen content is determined by the coa-
lescence of oxide particles as the rate controlling step. The model is in essence a combination of a
coalescence theory and an algorithm for turbulent recirculatory flows.
Engh and Lindskog31 also presented a fluid mechanical model for inclusion removal from liquid
steel. According to their model the total oxygen content after stirring time, t, is given by

It must be stressed that equation 11.2.7 is an extremely simplified expression. The rate of inclusion
removal depends on many factors including the inclusion type, refractory type, exact stirring con-
ditions, etc.
From experiments with an inductively stirred 140 tonne melt31 employing a range of values for the
specific stirring power, «. , the following approximate relationship can be obtained:
(11.2.8)
The above expression is an approximation and is valid only for moderate induction stirring. If it is
assumed that the final steady state total oxygen content, Cf, is small compared to Ci and Ct, com-
bination of equations 11.2.7 and 11.2.8 gives:
(11.2.9)
11.3 Reheating of the Bath
The ever increasing pressure on steelmakers to lower operating costs and increase efficiency has
made it necessary to make effective use of furnaces, BOF or EAF, and implement sequential con-
tinuous casting. These factors have prompted the installation of facilities for steel reheating,
needed for the additional time required for steel refining and the adjustment of the temperature of
the steel for uninterrupted sequential casting. The two methods for reheating steel in the ladle, arc
reheating and injecting oxygen and aluminum or silicon, will be discussed separately.
11.3.1 Arc Reheating
Over time, several types of furnaces for arc reheating have been developed and commercialized.
Examples are: ASEA-SKF, Daido-NKK, Finkl-Mohr, Fuchs, Lectromelt, MAN-GHH, Stein
Heurty-S.A.F.E., etc. Some of these designs also have the capability for degassing of the steel. An
important issue in arc reheating of a steel bath is whether the thermal energy which is supplied at,
or near, the surface of the melt can be dispersed rapidly enough such that no significant tempera-
ture gradients are created within the steel in the ladle. Szekely8 estimated that, in the absence of
agitation, the Biot number is of the order of 300, indicative of significant temperature gradients in
the steel bath. (The Biot number is defined as NBi = hL/keff, where h is the heat transfer coefficient
between the arc and the bath, keff is the thermal conductivity of the steel and L is the bath depth.)
In systems agitated either by induction stirring or gas bubbling, the Biot number is estimated to be
of the order of 5.0, indicative of small temperature gradients even in agitated systems. Once the
heat supply is discontinued, the temperature in gently agitated baths is expected to become uniform
quite rapidly.8

Ruddlestone et al.33 have compared the operating costs of an ASEA-SKF ladle furnace and a Fuchs
ladle furnace and found that in both cases the primary cost factor is electric power, followed by
electrode and refractory costs. This agrees with observations at The Timken Company.34 These
three cost categories will be discussed in more detail.
11.3.1.1 Electric Power
The heating efficiency, h, of arc heating is defined as:
(11.3.1)
where
DTact
=
the actual temperature increase of the bath, °C,
DTth
=
the theoretical temperature increase of the bath for 100% thermal
efficiency, °C,
E
=
the energy consumption, kWh/tonne.
The heat capacity of liquid steel is 0.22 kWh/tonne°C; i.e. for 1 tonne of liquid steel DTth = E/0.22.
The heating efficiency increases with increasing bath weight, as shown in Fig. 11.11 obtained from
data reported by Cotchen.35 These data represent overall averages comprising a range of heating
times. To minimize refractory consumption, heating times in ladle furnaces are kept as short as
possible, typically around 15 min.35 Further measures to shorten the reheating time and, thus, min-
imize refractory erosion are:2 the use of a large capacity transformer, e.g. 35–40 MW for a 200 to
250 tonne heat, submerged arcing in the slag layer, argon stirring through a bottom porous plug at
a flowrate of approximately 0.5 Nm3/min (~18 scfm), a slag layer thickness of approximately 1.3
times the length of the arc (values of the arc length as a function of the secondary current are given
by Turkdogan2).
11.3.1.2 Electrode Consumption
In general, electrode consumption in ladle furnaces increases with increasing cross sectional cur-
rent density and heating time. The trends are shown in Fig. 11.12 which is based on data from a
worldwide survey cited by Cotchen.35 For the Stein Heurtey-S.A.F.E. facility in operation at the
Faircrest steel plant of The Timken Company34 the average electrode consumption is 0.2 kg/tonne
for typical total reheat times of 20 minutes and average current densities of approximately 35
A/cm2.

11.3.1.3 Refractory Consumption
The refractory materials used in ladle furnace linings are similar for most steelmaking shops and
applied in the same configurations, i.e. slagline, bottom and barrel. Thus, a comparison of refrac-
tory consumption data can be made for a variety of shops. The data in Fig. 11.13 show that the ladle
life, expressed as the number of heats processed in a given ladle, increases with increasing bath
weight.35 At the Faircrest steel plant of The Timken Company, where 158 tonne (175 ton) heats are
processed, the average ladle life is 45 heats.34 It should be noted that the ladle refractory con-
sumption in any given shop is strongly affected by the specific operating practice, as reflected by
the considerable scatter in the data in Fig. 11.13. As mentioned before, submerged arc heating in
the slag layer should result in lower refractory consumption.
11.3.2 Reheating by Oxygen Injection 
Liquid steel can be reheated by oxidizing aluminum and/or silicon by means of oxygen injection
through a lance. The heats generated for the reactions

are:2 27,000 kJ/kg Al for reaction 11.3.2 and 28,500 kJ/kg Si in Fe–75% Si for reaction 11.3.3.
The enthalpies are calculated from the thermodynamic data, taking into account that the reagents,
aluminum and oxygen, must be heated from room temperature (R.T.) to the temperature of the bath
(1630°C = 2966°F). On the basis of 100% thermal efficiency the bath temperature can be raised
by 50°C (90°F) when 1 Nm3O2/tonne of steel is injected together with 1.46 kg Al/tonne or by
injecting 1.2 Nm3O2/tonne together with 1.85 kg Fe–75% Si/tonne2.
Reheating of steel in the ladle with submerged oxygen injection is being practiced at the steel
plants of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Barbus et al.36 have published data on reheating by sub-
merged injection of oxygen into 270 tonne heats. From their data the temperature increase as a
function of the specific quantity of oxygen (Nm3/tonne of steel) injected can be obtained. This is
shown in Fig. 11.14, line b. A comparison of the presented data with the maximum attainable tem-
perature increase for 100% thermal efficiency (line a) indicates that reheating by means of sub-
merged oxygen injection is approximately 70% efficient.
Miyashita and Kikuchi37 presented data on the temperature increase in a 160 tonne RH-OB vessel.
Their data are indicated by line c in Fig. 11.14 and indicate an average thermal efficiency of
20–30%. (Fruehan68 quotes a reheating efficiency of approximately 80% for the RH-OB operation
at the Oita works of the Nippon Steel Corporation.) Data for a 245 tonne RH-KTB vessel38, in
which the oxygen is supplied via a top lance instead of through submerged tuyeres as in the RH-
OB, are indicated by line d in Fig. 11.14. The thermal efficiency for the RH-KTB process appears
to be similar to that for submerged oxygen injection into the ladle.

A comparison of total oxygen contents measured in slabs cast from oxygen-reheated heats and heats
that were not reheated showed no significant differences between the two sets of values.36 In addi-
tion, Griffing et al.39 compared the inclusion ratings in rail-grade steels produced from oxygen-
reheated steels and heats that were not reheated and found no significant differences between the
two. These authors recommend the addition of a synthetic ladle slag after reheating, followed by a
thorough argon rinse to float out the alumina inclusions so they may become dissolved in the slag.
Jung et al.52 studied the effect of reheating with aluminum and oxygen in the RH-OB process on the
cleanliness of the final product. An increase in the total oxygen content during and shortly after oxy-
gen blowing was observed. However, the total oxygen content in the final product was found to be
similar for steels treated with oxygen and aluminum compared with those treated without oxygen
blowing in the RH, provided the total bath circulation time in the RH-OB was sufficiently long.
11.4 Refining in the Ladle
The refining of steel in the ladle is broadly defined here as comprising the following operations:
deoxidation, desulfurization, dephosphorization, controlled additions of alloying elements and inclu-
sion modification. Each of these operations will be discussed in detail in the following sections.
11.4.1 Deoxidation
The first step in the refining sequence in the ladle is usually the deoxidation of the steel with fer-
romanganese, ferrosilicon, silicomanganese and aluminum. There are three categories of steel
deoxidation.
(a) Steel deoxidized with ferromanganese to yield 100–200 ppm dissolved oxygen;
these are usually resulfurized steel grades.
(b) Semi-killed steels deoxidized with:
(i)
Si/Mn to yield 50–70 ppm dissolved oxygen,
(ii)
Si/Mn/Al to yield 25–40 ppm dissolved oxygen,
(iii) Si/Mn/Ca to yield 15–20 ppm dissolved oxygen.
(c) Killed steels deoxidized with aluminum to yield 2–4 ppm dissolved oxygen.
The reaction equilibrium data for steel deoxidation are discussed in depth in Chapter 2, Section
2.10. In this section the focus will be on the practical aspects of deoxidation.
11.4.1.1 Deoxidation in the Presence of Synthetic Slags
The practice of refining steel in the ladle has made it possible to deoxidize the steel partially with
Fe/Mn and/or Fe/Si later followed by a final deoxidation with aluminum. Such a practice has sev-
eral advantages, including minimization of nitrogen pickup during tapping as discussed in Section
11.1.1, minimization of phosphorus reversion from the carried-over furnace slag, and minimiza-
tion of aluminum losses due to reaction with carried-over furnace slag.
Today the use of synthetic slags in the ladle is an integral part of ladle metallurgy because of the
requirements necessary to produce ultraclean steels, frequently combined with a demand for extra
low sulfur contents. The concept of using synthetic slags in ladles dates back to the 1930s when
the Perrin process was developed for the enhanced deoxidation of open hearth or Bessemer steel
with ferromanganese or ferrosilicon by tapping the steel on a molten calcium aluminosilicate slag
placed on the bottom of the tap ladle. The dissolution of the deoxidation products such as Mn(Fe)O
or manganese silicates in the calcium aluminosilicate slag lowers their thermodynamic activity,
thus increasing the extent of deoxidation.
11.4.1.1.1 Partial Deoxidation with Ferromanganese Turkdogan11 described the results obtained for deox-
idation with ferromanganese in several plant trials. When deoxidizing with ferromanganese the
deoxidation product is Mn(Fe)O, the activity of which is lowered in the presence of a calcium

aluminate slag. The change in dissolved oxygen and manganese contents during tapping of a 200
tonne heat of steel to which 1800 kg of lime-saturated calcium aluminate and ferromanganese was
added when the tap ladle was 1/8 full is shown schematically in Fig. 11.15. Upon addition of the
ferromanganese, the small amount of steel present in the ladle is almost completely deoxidized,
resulting in approximately 1.6% manganese in the steel. As the ladle is filled, the dissolved man-
ganese is consumed by the deoxidation reaction and decreases to approximately 0.32% when the
ladle is full and the residual dissolved oxygen content is reduced to approximately 300 ppm from
the original 650 ppm at the beginning of tap.
The results obtained using this deoxidation practice in EAF and OBM (Q-BOP) shops11 are
depicted in Fig. 11.16 for steels containing less than 0.003 wt.% of aluminum and silicon each.

Without calcium aluminate slag addition to the tap ladle, i.e. deoxidation with manganese and iron
only and pure Mn(Fe)O as the deoxidation product, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the
steel would follow the broken line in Fig. 11.16. In the EAF trial heats there was no argon stirring
in the ladle during furnace tapping. Yet, it was found that the slag-aided partial deoxidation of the
steel attained during tap was close to the levels determined by the slag–metal equilibrium. This
observation led Turkdogan11 to conclude that there was sufficient mixing of slag and metal to pro-
mote relatively rapid deoxidation in the ladle during tap.
11.4.1.1.2 Deoxidation with Silicomanganese It is well known that the deoxidation of steel with
manganese and silicon together leads to lower dissolved oxygen contents than the deoxidation
with either of these elements alone. This is because the activities of the oxides in the deoxida-
tion reaction
[Si] + 2(MnO) = 2[Mn] + (SiO2)
(11.4.1)
are less than unity. The symbols within the square brackets refer to species dissolved in the steel,
those within parentheses to species in the manganese silicate phase. By making use of the oxide
activity data in the MnO–SiO2 system together with the thermodynamic data for reaction 11.4.1,
Turkdogan40 computed the equilibrium state pertaining to the deoxidation with silicomanganese,
as shown in Fig. 2.127.
When the deoxidation with silicomanganese takes place in the presence of a small amount of alu-
minum dissolved in the steel the deoxidation product is molten manganese aluminosilicate and the
resulting dissolved oxygen content is approximately 50 ppm for a steel containing roughly 0.8%
manganese and 0.2% silicon.11 This is approximately half the value in a steel deoxidized with sili-
comanganese and not containing aluminum. This is because the activities of MnO and SiO2 are low-
ered further in the presence of the aluminosilicate phase. For example, it is possible to decrease the
dissolved oxygen content to approximately 20 ppm by means of deoxidation with silicomanganese
together with the addition of 1000 kg of prefused calcium aluminate to a 200 tonne heat of steel.11
For ladle slags containing a high percentage of alumina there will be some reduction of the alu-
mina by the silicon in the steel. The data for steel containing aluminum and silicon in equilibrium
with calcium aluminate slags containing approximately 5% silica are shown in Fig. 11.17.2 As
may be seen from this diagram, appreciable pickup of aluminum from the slag can be expected if
the steel is initially low in aluminum, e.g.
<0.01% Al, and contains approximately
0.2% silicon. The final stage of deoxida-
tion of the steel in the ladle is determined
by the amount of aluminum recovered
from the slag.
11.4.1.1.3
Deoxidation with Calcium/Silicon
Semi-killed steel deoxidized with silico-
manganese can be deoxidized further with
calcium/silicon, e.g. by injection of Cal-Sil
in the form of cored wire. Iyengar and
Duderstadt41 studied the deoxidation of 50
kg steel melts at 1620°C with silicoman-
ganese and varying amounts of CaSi. Some
of their results are shown in Fig. 11.18,
from which it is seen that the dissolved oxy-
gen content in a low carbon steel deoxi-
dized with silicomanganese can be lowered
from approximately 85 to approximately 55
ppm by adding 2.5 kg CaSi/tonne. Similar
observations were made in a series of plant

trials42 in which Cal-Sil cored wire
was injected into 60 tonne heats of
steel. The lower dissolved oxygen
content obtained after the addition of
Cal-Sil is a result of the formation of
calcium manganese silicate as the
deoxidation product, further decreas-
ing the activities of MnO and SiO2.
11.4.1.1.4
Deoxidation with Aluminum
Numerous experimental data, ob-
tained by the emf technique, exist on
the solubility product of Al2O3 in pure
liquid iron. The reported values for
1600°C are in the range43
[%Al]2.[%O]3 = 
9.77 3 10–15 to 1.2 3 10–13
(11.4.2)
The higher values are from older work
when the interference with the emf
readings caused by partial electronic
conduction in the electrolyte of the
emf cell was not well recognized. In
the most recent work by Dimitrov et
al.43 the emf readings were corrected
for electronic conduction, leading to
the value of 9.77 3 10–15 for the
Al2O3 solubility product at 1600°C
(2912°F).
In addition, Dimitrov et al.43 did a number of emf measurements in inductively stirred iron melts in
contact with CaO–Al2O3 slag mixtures in which the activity of alumina was less than unity. They
observed that the aluminum-oxygen relationship in these melts was indistinguishable from that in iron
melts in equilibrium with pure alumina. Similar observations were reported by Schuermann et al.44
These experimental findings indicate that even in the presence of a calcium aluminate slag the dis-
solved oxygen content in steel is controlled by the alumina inclusions always present in the inte-
rior of the bath. In ladle metallurgy operations where the steel is frequently covered with a calcium
aluminate slag containing minor amounts of magnesia and silica, it is therefore to be expected that
the final dissolved oxygen content is controlled by the alumina inclusions dispersed throughout the
bath. A measurable decrease in dissolved oxygen content as a result of treatment with calcium alu-
minate slag is not to be expected. A decrease in dissolved oxygen content can only be expected if
substantially all the alumina inclusions have been modified to calcium aluminates, e.g. by calcium
treatment; this will be discussed in more detail in Section 11.4.5.2
11.4.2 Desulfurization
In certain steel grades, such as those used in line pipe applications, a very low sulfur content is
required, e.g. 20 ppm or less. These low sulfur contents can only be achieved by steel desulfuriza-
tion in the ladle in the presence of a calcium aluminate slag when the steel is fully killed.
Desulfurization is also discussed in depth in Chapter 2. The governing reaction is

The change in free energy for reaction 11.4.3 based on the most recent data on the solubility prod-
uct of alumina in liquid iron43 is given by
DG° = –319,343 + 111.3T, J/mole
(11.4.4)
This gives for the equilibrium constant of reaction 11.4.3
The oxide and sulfide activities are relative to the respective pure solid phases and the activities of
aluminum and sulfur dissolved in liquid iron are defined such that for dilute solutions, below approx-
imately 0.5 wt.%, the activities may be replaced by their respective concentrations in weight percent.
For a given slag composition the activities of the oxides are fixed and may be incorporated in the
equilibrium constant while the sulfur content of the slag, (%S), is proportional to the sulfide activity,
aCaS. Thus, the equilibrium constant may be replaced by a pseudo-equilibrium constant as follows
(11.4.6)
For a given aluminum content of the steel the ratio LS = (%S) / [%S] is a function of the ladle slag
composition at a given temperature. This is shown in Fig. 11.19 where lines of equal LS-values are
projected on the Al2O3–CaO–SiO2 phase diagram for slags in equilibrium with steels containing
0.03% aluminum.45 For different aluminum contents the LS-values in Fig. 11.19 should be multi-
plied by the factor (%Al/0.03)2/3.

where

Depending on the specific operating condi-
tions, the range of compositions of ladle
slags commonly used is: 20–40% Al2O3,
35–55% CaO, 8–15% MgO and 10–15%
SiO2 together with minor amounts of FeO
and MnO. In some cases CaF2 is added to
the ladle slag.
11.4.2.1 Desulfurization Rate
For reaction 11.4.3 to proceed rapidly such
that the required degree of desulfurization
can take place within a practical time span,
good mixing of steel and slag is essential.
The rate at which sulfur can be removed is,
therefore, strongly affected by the gas
flowrate or the stirring power density. As
the capacity of typical ladle slags to absorb
sulfur is high, the rate of desulfurization is
controlled by mass transfer in the liquid
steel and the rate of desulfurization is
described by equation 2.10.19.
Riboud and Vasse45 calculated the relative
sulfur removal, R, for various conditions;
the results are shown in Fig. 11.20. This
diagram may be used to estimate the spe-
cific quantity of ladle slag, r, required to
give the desired degree of sulfur removal, as illustrated by the following example.
Consider a shop where hard stirring, equivalent to a stirring power density of 100 W/tonne, is prac-
ticed for desulfurization with a ladle slag with a composition equivalent to LS=500. From Fig.
11.10 the value kS ~ 0.13 min–1 is obtained for «. = 100 W/tonne. Assume that the total time to be
reserved for desulfurization is 15 min to achieve 80% desulfurization, e.g. from 0.01 to 0.002% S.
From Fig. 11.20 it is found that R = 0.80 can be achieved in the given time, provided rLS=10 or
r=0.02, equivalent with a specific quantity of ladle slag of 20 kg/tonne of steel (40 lb/ton). For a
stirring power density of approximately 50 W/tonne the value of kS is estimated to be approxi-
mately 0.03 min–1 (Fig. 11.10) and a treatment time of 65 min would be required to achieve 80%
desulfurization. This example illustrates the importance of hard stirring for effective desulfuriza-
tion to low sulfur levels.
The rate of desulfurization depends on stirring rate, slag chemistry which affects LS and Al con-
tent, which also effects LS. Application of equation 2.10.19 indicates desulfurization equilibrium in
a well-stirred ladle using 0.85–1.10 Nm3 (30–40 scfm)Ar occurs in approximately 10–15 min.
To achieve very low sulfur contents the injection of fluxes into the ladle is often practiced. Hara et
al.46 describe results obtained by injecting 70% CaO–30% CaF2 power mixtures into 150 tonne
heats of low-carbon Al-Si killed steels. Their results are shown in Fig. 11.21. It is noted that pow-
der injection results in a desulfurization rate that is, on average, approximately 15% faster than
desulfurization with a top slag only, combined with gas stirring. This implies that the contribution
of the so-called transitory reaction with the powder mixture as it ascends the bath is minor com-
pared with the reaction with the top slag, in general agreement with a mathematical model devel-
oped by Sawada et al.47
Desulfurization of steel in the ladle is accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the steel
bath. Today most steelmaking shops are equipped with facilities for reheating the steel, either by
electric arc or by injection of oxygen and aluminum. If no facilities for reheating are available an

arise. Also, ladle dephosphorization may be necessary in BOF shops in which hot metal with a high
phosphorus content is charged and where there is no capability of dephosphorizing the hot metal
prior to charging to the BOF.
Removal of phosphorus from the steel in the ladle is achieved by treating the steel with lime-based
oxidizing slags containing iron oxide. The fundamentals of the phosphorus reaction are discussed
in Chapter 2.
For a steel with a given dissolved oxygen content the ratio LP = (%P) / [%P] is a function only of
the slag composition and the temperature. This is shown in Fig. 11.22 where lines of equal LP-val-
ues are projected on the CaO–FeO–(SiO2 + P2O5) phase diagram49, the dissolved oxygen contents
being controlled by the Fe–FeO equilibrium.
Dephosphorization in the ladle during tapping of the BOF converter was studied by Becker et al.50
who used varying quantities of a mixture of 50% CaO, 30% iron oxide (FeOx) and 20% CaF2.
Approximately 30–40% of the mixture was placed on the bottom of the tap ladle while the remain-
der was added during tap. The phosphorus content of the steel tapped from the converter varied
between approximately 0.01 and 0.035%. The results of these plant trials are summarized in Fig.
11.23, reproduced from the data by Becker et al.50 It is seen from this diagram that approximately
75% of the phosphorus was removed when 12 kg/tonne of the aforementioned mixture was used.
In the practice described by Becker et al.50 the high-phosphorus slag was removed by reladling fol-
lowed by reheating in a ladle furnace.
Another example of steel dephosphorization in the ladle at tap is given by Bannenberg and
Lachmund.51 In this practice the steel was tapped open while, depending on the anticipated quantity
of converter slag carryover, varying amounts of lime, ore and sometimes fluorspar were added dur-
ing tap to produce a lime-saturated dephosphorizing slag high in iron oxide. The results of these
trials indicate 60–70% phosphorous removal.

Because of the oxidizing conditions prevailing during dephosphorization, manganese and
chromium losses are to be expected, as discussed by Bannenberg and Lachmund.51 The authors
derived the following relationship between the loss in chromium or manganese, hX, and the degree
of dephosphorization, hP

where
X

Cr or Mn and
hX
=
{[%X]i – [%X]f} / [%X]i

=
{[%P]i – [%P]f} / [%P]i
From the plant data Bannenberg and Lachmund51 derived the following values for KX: KCr = 6.6
and KMn = 2.2. For example, for 50% phosphorus removal (hP = 50) the chromium loss would be
13% (hCr = 13) while the manganese loss would be 31% (hMn = 31), as found from equation
11.4.7.
11.4.4 Alloy Additions
Metals and alloys can be added to liquid steel at various stages in the steelmaking process, e.g.
inside the furnace, during furnace tapping, in the ladle furnace, during vacuum treatment, etc. The
timing of the additions depends on the process route, the shop logistics and on certain characteris-
tics of the addition in question such as its melting point, volatility and its susceptibility to oxida-
tion. For example, nickel can be added to the EAF at any time as nickel oxide, which is easily
reduced. In the oxygen steelmaking process route alloying additions such as ferrosilicon and fer-
romanganese are made during furnace tapping while the other alloys are added in subsequent
stages of secondary steelmaking.
Argyropoulos and Guthrie53 were perhaps the first to undertake a systematic study on the dissolu-
tion kinetics of ferroalloys. They defined two broad categories of ferroalloys: class I ferroalloys
with melting points below the temperature of liquid steel, and class II ferroalloys with melting
points higher than the liquid steel temperature. The thermophysical properties of the class I and
class II ferroalloys are summarized in Tables 11.5 and 11.6, respectively.
When a ferroalloy is added to liquid steel a solidified shell of steel forms around the alloy particle
as a result of the local chilling effect. As time progresses, the shell melts while the ferroalloy inside
the shell is heated to its melting point. The complete dissolution is governed by convective heat
transfer processes in the bath as well as the size of the ferroalloy added.
The class II ferroalloys, listed in Table 11.6 all have melting points higher than the temperature of
the liquid steel. These alloys dissolve at a slower rate than the class I alloys, their dissolution rate
being controlled by mass transfer in the liquid steel, even in agitated baths. It is, therefore, impor-
tant to ensure that their size is within 3–10 mm in order to obtain good mixing, fast dissolution and
high recovery rates. Compacted powder mixtures of ferroalloys such as ferrovanadium, ferrotung-
sten and ferromolybdenum dissolve faster than solid pieces of similar size. Autoexothermic alloys,
which generate heat upon melting, can also be used for faster melting and dissolution as well as
improved recovery. Argyropoulos and Guthrie53 present a number of predicted dissolution times
for an assortment of ferroalloys of varying sizes under a number of different conditions such as
bath temperature and convection within the bath.
In a later investigation Lee et al.54 made an extensive study of the dissolution kinetics in liquid steel
as well as in slags of the most widely used ferroalloys such as ferrosilicon (75 FeSi), silicoman-
ganese (SiMn), high-carbon ferromanganese (HCFeMn) and high-carbon ferrochrome (HCFeCr).
Their findings corroborated the earlier results of Argyropoulos and Guthrie.53

Several methods of alloy addition are practiced. Examples are: throwing of filled bags, adding with
a shovel or via mechanized chutes, wire feeding, powder injection, bullet shooting, etc. A special
process for making alloy additions is the so-called CAS process (Composition Adjustment by Sealed
argon bubbling). In this process a refractory-lined snorkel is partially immersed in the steel bath in
such a manner that it envelopes the ascending gas plume created by the injection of argon through
the porous plug in the ladle bottom. Alloy additions are made onto the liquid steel surface within the
area covered by the snorkel. The plume eye within the snorkel is filled with argon, thus has a low
oxygen partial pressure preventing oxidation of the alloy addition. Melting and distribution rates are

high as a result of the agitation brought about by the ascending gas bubbles. Mazumdar and
Guthrie55 have made water model studies to investigate the subsurface motion of both buoyant and
sinking additions in the CAS process. The study showed that buoyant additions such as aluminum
and ferrosilicon dissolve more readily into the steel bath rather than react partially with the slag as
in conventional addition methods, thus giving improved recovery. The authors further recommend
that ferromanganese and ferroniobium be crushed to an average size of approximately 5 mm to
obtain better control.
Wirefeeding of alloys by means of the cored-wire techniques, developed primarily for the addition
of calcium to steel, is practiced for adding elements that are less dense than steel or have a limited
solubility, high vapor pressure and high affinity for oxygen. Wirefeeding is also used in cases
where the element to be added is toxic or when very small additions are required. The cored-wire
technique permits the quantity of alloy or elements being fed into the steel to be adjusted with high
precision and to trim the composition of the steel within narrow limits. For example, ferroboron or
tellurium additions can be made in precise and minute quantities by wirefeeding. Excessive addi-
tions of these elements may cause hot-shortness.
It is also possible to wirefeed aluminum with the same wirefeeding equipment used for cored-wire.
Advantages of aluminum wire additions include: higher recovery, better control of aluminum con-
tent, and improved cleanliness.56 Herbert et al.57 give examples of improved control of the steel
aluminum content by wirefeeding at the Lackenby plant of the British Steel Corporation.
Schade et al.58 studied the dissolution characteristics of cored-wire additions of ferromolybdenum,
ferroniobium and ferrochromium modified with minor quantities of silicon—so-called
microexothermic alloys—to achieve improved dissolution into liquid steels. The exothermicity
exhibited by these modified alloys is based on the formation of an intermetallic compound (a sili-
cide) which is accompanied by the release of heat. The enthalpy released is sufficient to melt the
compound, thus allowing rapid dissolution of the ferroalloy into the liquid steel. The enhanced dis-
solution rate of these modified ferroalloys makes them well-suited for tundish additions where the
relatively short residence time requires a rapid dissolution of additions.
11.4.5 Calcium Treatment and Inclusion Modification
The addition of calcium to steel goes back a long time, Watts59 being the first to add CaSi to a steel
melt. The widespread practice of calcium additions to steel melts did not start until the 1960s with
the development of improved addition methods and composite calcium-bearing alloys. Today calcium

treatment of steel is a common practice, with particular emphasis on the modification of alumina
inclusions in aluminum-killed steels to prevent nozzle clogging during continuous casting operations.
As a result of the treatment with calcium, the alumina and silica inclusions are converted to liquid
calcium aluminates or calcium silicates. These liquid inclusions are globular in shape because of
surface tension effects. This change in inclusion composition and shape is commonly known as
inclusion morphology control or modification. The effect of calcium treatment on inclusion mor-
phology is illustrated schematically in Fig. 11.24.
It is seen from Fig. 11.24 that few or no sulfide stringers are expected to be present after rolling
steel that was successfully treated with calcium. This phenomenon is known as sulfide shape con-
trol by calcium treatment, the underlying fundamental principles of which will be discussed later.
Examples of other metallurgical advantages brought about by the modification of oxide and sul-
fide inclusions by calcium treatment of steel are:2 improvement of castability in continuous cast-
ing operations through minimization or prevention of nozzle clogging; decreasing inclusion-related
surface defects in billet, bloom and slab castings; improving the machinability of the final product
at high cutting speeds; and minimization of the susceptibility of high-strength low-alloy (HSLA)
line pipe steels to hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) in sour gas or oil environments.
11.4.5.1 Addition of Calcium to Steel Melts
The boiling point of calcium is 1491°C (2716°F), accordingly calcium is a vapor at steelmaking
temperatures. Thus, when adding calcium to liquid steel special measures must be taken to ensure
its proper recovery in the steel bath. Recently developed processes for adding calcium to a liquid
steel bath are all based on the principle of introducing the calcium or calcium alloy into the bath at
the greatest possible depth so as to make use of the increased pressure from the ferrostatic head to
prevent the calcium from evaporating.
Ototani60 gives details regarding the TN (Thyssen Niederrhein) process for injecting calcium with
argon as a carrier gas as well as the SCAT process, also known as the bullet shooting method.
Today the majority of the steel producers add calcium by wirefeeding. The principle is similar to
wirefeeding of ferroalloys and aluminum, discussed in Section 11.4.4.
When wirefeeding calcium in the conventional manner, there is a possibility that the wire does not
travel in a straight downward line after
entering the bath, thus causing the calcium
to be released at a shallow bath depth and
decreasing the calcium recovery in the
steel. To prevent this, the so-called wire
lance (WL) method for adding calcium was
developed. A schematic illustration is
depicted in Fig. 11.25.
The wire lance method ensures that the
calcium wire travels in a straight down-
ward line after entering the bath while it is
claimed that the dispersion of calcium
throughout the bath is improved by the
argon which is injected simultaneously.
The calcium recovery or yield observed
for additions with the wire lance process is
compared with that observed for conven-
tional wirefeeding in Fig. 11.26. The better
recovery of calcium obtained with the wire
lance method is especially pronounced for
calcium addition rates less than approxi-
mately 0.2 kg/tonne (0.4 lb/ton).

(11.4.9)
while the efficiency of calcium retention in the steel is given by
(11.4.10)
Experience obtained in numerous plant trials has shown that the calcium retention efficiency
decreases with increasing quantity of calcium injected. The amount of calcium to be injected has
to be adjusted in accordance with the degree of cleanliness of the steel or its total oxygen content.
Obviously, injecting more calcium than can react with the available inclusions leads to a low cal-
cium retention efficiency. Furthermore, it is to be expected that the calcium retention efficiency in

11.4.5.2 Reactions of Calcium in Steel and Inclusion Modification
Regardless of the form in which calcium is added to liquid steel, e.g. as Cal-Sil, Ca-Al or as pure
calcium admixed with nickel or iron powder, the subsequent reactions taking place in the bath are
the same. The following series of reactions is expected to occur to varying extents in aluminum-
killed steels containing alumina inclusions and sulfur

ses are dissolved in the aluminate phase.
Observations by a number of investigators
have indicated that the extent to which reac-
tion 11.4.13 occurs is negligible. For steels
with sufficiently low sulfur contents reaction
11.4.15 will take place first, followed by reac-
tion 11.4.16. The critical question is for which
sulfur content reaction 11.4.14 predominates
such that, for a given quantity of calcium
added, there is insufficient calcium available
to modify the alumina inclusions according to
reaction 11.4.15. Adequate modification of
the solid alumina inclusions into liquid cal-
cium aluminates is essential in order to pre-
vent nozzle clogging during continuous
casting operations.
By combining the data for the activities of the
oxides in aluminate melts61,62 with the equilib-
rium constant for reaction 11.4.16 as given by
equation 11.4.5, the critical sulfur content for
the formation of liquid calcium aluminates can
be evaluated.63 The results are shown in Fig.
11.27 and Fig. 11.28 where the critical sulfur
and aluminum contents for the formation of
liquid alumina-saturated calcium aluminate
and liquid 12CaO•7Al2O3
are shown.

at the indicated temperatures; aCaS = 1. From Ref. 63.

Whenever the aluminum and sulfur contents
in the steel fall below a curve for a given
temperature, the formation of a liquid cal-
cium aluminate is favored.
The underlying assumption made in the cal-
culations of the diagrams in Fig. 11.27 and
Fig. 11.28 was that the activity of calcium
sulfide equals unity. However, the presence
of manganese in most steels causes the sul-
fur to precipitate as calcium manganese sul-
fides, Ca(Mn)S, in which the activity of
calcium sulfide in less than unity, thus
decreasing the critical sulfur content for the
formation of liquid calcium aluminate.
Kor63 has shown that the presence of up to
2% manganese in the steel has only a small
effect on the critical sulfur content. The rela-
tionship between aluminum and sulfur for
the formation of liquid calcium aluminates
for aCaS = 0.75 is shown in Fig. 2.139.
Larsen and Fruehan64 studied the modifica-
tion of oxide inclusions by calcium in a num-
ber of samples obtained from laboratory melts
as well as from steelmaking operations. The
results from this study are summarized in Fig. 11.29 from which it may be seen that the agreement
with the theoretical predictions, indicated by the curves labeled CA and C12A7, is generally good.

In general, it is difficult to assess whether the injection of calcium into the steel has resulted in the
desired degree of inclusion modification. Larsen and Fruehan64 have pointed out that, in theory,
the degree of inclusion modification can be determined by measuring the activity of oxygen in the
steel by means of an oxygen sensor. In general, the activity of alumina in calcium aluminate inclu-
sions is less than unity. Thus, the activity of oxygen in a steel in equilibrium with a calcium alu-
minate is less than that in a steel in equilibrium with alumina. As the inclusions are modified from
alumina to calcium-rich calcium aluminate, the activity of oxygen in the steel decreases, provided
the aluminum content of the steel is essentially constant. This is shown schematically in Fig. 11.30
from which it can be seen that the decrease in oxygen activity (in ppm) is significant whenever
complete modification to liquid calcium aluminate has occurred. Thus, an oxygen sensor mea-
surement before and after calcium treatment should, in principle, indicate how effective the treat-
ment was in terms of inclusion modification.
In many samples obtained from steelmaking operations the oxide inclusions contain varying
amounts of magnesia. Kor63 has estimated the effect of the presence of magnesia in the oxide inclu-
sions on the critical sulfur content for the formation of liquid calcium magnesium aluminate inclu-
sions for a given aluminum content of the steel. It was found that for inclusions containing less than
10% magnesia, the critical sulfur content is somewhat higher than that for inclusions not contain-
ing magnesia.

11.4.5.3 Sulfide Shape Control
In steels not treated with calcium, the sulfur precipitates as finely dispersed manganese sulfide par-
ticles in the interdendritic liquid that freezes last. The manganese sulfides delineate the prior
austenitic grain boundaries in the as-cast structure. During hot rolling the manganese sulfide par-
ticles are deformed, resulting in stringers in the rolled product. These stringers make the final prod-
uct susceptible to, for example, hydrogen-induced cracking in sour gas or oil environments.
In calcium-treated low-sulfur steels the grain boundary precipitation of MnS during solidification
is suppressed as a result of the precipitation of sulfur as a Ca(Mn)S complex on the calcium alu-
minate inclusions as indicated by the following reaction
(CaO) + 2[S] + [Mn] + 2/3[Al] ® (CaS•MnS) + 1/3(Al2O3)
(11.4.17)
The extent of sulfide shape control that can be achieved during solidification of calcium-treated
steel depends on the total oxygen, sulfur and calcium contents of the steel. This is described by a
model based on the reactions occurring in the impurity enriched interdendritic liquid during solid-
ification.65 On the basis of this model, the following criteria can be derived for the tundish com-
positions of aluminum-killed steels to give adequate sulfide shape control in the final product.2
In steels with a total oxygen content of 10 ppm or less and relatively high sulfur contents, e.g. >
100 ppm, sulfide shape control by means of calcium treatment is obviously not feasible. To mini-
mize the occurrence of sulfide stringers in such steels, the addition of tellurium or sometimes sele-
nium has been found to be beneficial. Due to the strong effect of both these elements on the
interfacial tension between sulfides and steel, the tendency of sulfide stringer formation during
rolling is decreased. The result is that after rolling the sulfides are ellipsoidal in shape with a
length-to-width ratio that depends on the Te/S-ratio in the steel.63 Tellurium is usually added to liq-
uid steel either by powder injection or by wirefeeding.
11.5 Vacuum Degassing
Vacuum degassing of steel has an even longer history than the treatment of steel with calcium,
Aitken66 possibly being the first to have proposed an arrangement for the ladle degassing of a heat
of steel. An overview of the various processes in use until 1965 was given by Flux.67 Since the
1950s and 1960s many new developments have taken place in regard to equipment for the vacuum
treatment of steel as well as the technology of steel refining in vacuum degassing facilities. A more
recent overview dealing with vacuum degassing was prepared by Fruehan.68
Initially, vacuum degassing was used primarily for hydrogen removal. However, during the last
twenty years or so there has been an increased use of vacuum degassing for the production of ultra-
low-carbon (ULC) steels with carbon contents of 30 ppm or less. Furthermore, a relatively new
family of steel grades, the so-called interstitial-free (IF) steels with carbon and nitrogen contents
of 30 ppm or less, has appeared on the scene. To achieve these low carbon and nitrogen contents,

a treatment under vacuum is mandatory. Presently, almost every high-quality steel producer has
installed a vacuum treatment facility.
11.5.1 General Process Descriptions
More detailed schematic illustrations of the most popular degassing systems are presented in
Section 11.6. For the purpose of the present discussion a brief description of the salient features is
given here. There are two principal types of degassers: recirculating systems such as RH, RH-OB,
RH-KTB and DH; and non-recirculating systems such as ladle or tank degassers, including VAD
(vacuum arc degassing) and VOD (vacuum oxygen decarburization), and stream degassers.
In both recirculating and non-recirculating systems argon is used as the lifting or stirring gas. In
recirculating systems the argon is used as the so-called lifting gas to lower the apparent density of
the liquid steel to be lifted up from the ladle into the vacuum vessel. In non-recirculating systems
argon is used as the stirring gas to promote the removal of hydrogen and/or nitrogen and to homog-
enize the bath.
The decision which degassing system, recirculating or non-recirculating, to install in a given shop
is largely determined by the product mix to be produced. If a relatively large number of heats has
to be decarburized to very low levels to produce ULC or IF steels, a recirculating system such as
the RH or one of its modifications is usually preferred. For example, a carbon content of 25 ppm
can easily be attained in an RH or RH-OB (KTB) degasser whereas in a tank degasser, such as a
VOD, such low carbon contents cannot be attained within a practical time span.
As will be discussed later, there is not much difference between recirculating and non-recirculat-
ing systems in terms of the effectiveness with which hydrogen or nitrogen can be removed. Thus,
if the primary function of the degasser is to remove hydrogen and sometimes nitrogen, the choice
of system will be determined primarily by the desired match between the steel melting vessel (BOF
or EAF) and the caster as well as by considerations in regard to capital and operating costs.
11.5.2 Vacuum Carbon Deoxidation
One of the purposes to treat steel in an RH or RH-OB (KTB) degasser is to lower the dissolved
oxygen content of the steel by means of carbon deoxidation before adding aluminum to kill the
steel completely. With such a carbon deoxidation practice there are considerable cost savings as a
result of the decreased usage of aluminum.
Vacuum carbon deoxidation is described by the following reaction
[C] + [O] ® CO (g)
(11.5.1)
where the carbon and oxygen are dissolved in the steel bath. The carbon-oxygen relationship dur-
ing the vacuum decarburization treatment is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.138. In the RH
process, decarburization proceeds nearly to the stoichiometrically related decrease in carbon and
oxygen contents:D ([O] = (16/12) D[C]. This is also called the self-decarburization process.
Because in the RH-OB (KTB) process oxygen is supplied from an outside source, decarburization
initially takes place without a simultaneous decrease in the steel oxygen content, the so-called
forced decarburization. In the later stages decarburization follows the path of self-decarburization.
One of the advantages of an RH-OB (KTB) over a conventional RH is that the steel can be tapped
at a higher carbon content, thus decreasing converter processing time and increasing the iron yield
(lower slag FeO).
Plant data obtained for the carbon and oxygen contents of the steel before and after RH treatment
are shown in Fig. 11.31, reproduced from data quoted by Turkdogan.2 Similar results are obtained
with the tank degasser.69 Although the pressure in the vacuum vessel was approximately 0.001 atm,
the final carbon and oxygen contents correspond to CO pressures varying from 0.06 to 0.08 atm,

After approximately 20 min treatment time, the final oxygen content of the steel is always high
when the initial content is high (low initial carbon content) in both the tank degasser and the RH,
Fig. 11.32.2
It can be seen from Fig. 11.32 that the decrease in oxygen content of the steel as a result of the vac-
uum decarburization treatment is less than that expected from the stoichiometry of reaction 11.5.1.
This is because there is oxygen transfer from the ladle slag to the steel during vacuum decarbur-
ization. Another source of oxygen is the iron oxide-rich skull which builds up on the inside of the
vacuum vessel as a result of previous operations. Thus, some decarburization via the following
reaction takes place also 
(FeO) + [C] ® Fe + CO (g)
(11.5.2)
From the stoichiometry of the reactions, the material balance gives the following relation for the
quantity of oxygen transferred to the steel from the ladle slag and the oxidized skull inside the vac-
uum vessel2
DO (slag) = (16/12) D([C] – D[O]
(11.5.3)
where
D[C] = [%C]i– [%C]f
D[O] = [ppm O]i – [ppm O]f
The values of DO (slag) derived from the plant data using equation 11.5.3 are shown in Fig. 11.33.2
It is seen that during decarburization the amount of oxygen transferred from slag to steel is higher
the higher the initial carbon content. For initial carbon contents of 200 ppm or less there is no more
oxygen pickup from the slag during vacuum decarburization and the carbon content decreases
according to the stoichiometry of reaction 11.5.1.

The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of decarburization, q, is proportional to the cross sec-

vations on 240 to 300 tonne RH vessels Kato et al.71 found the following approximate empirical
relationship for q:
(11.5.7)
valid for 0.0025 ² [%C] ² 0.01.
It should be noted that the actual rate is very complex. The reaction occurs at various sites
including the argon bubble surface, refractory surfaces, metal free surfaces, and homogeneously
in the melt. Therefore, equation 11.5.7 should only be used for similar conditions for which it
was developed.
According to the above equations, the rate of decarburization will increase with snorkel diameter
and vessel diameter, which was confirmed by actual plant data.71
In Fig. 11.34 the decarburization rate constant, kC, is shown as a function of the specific flowrate
(Nm3/min tonne) of the stirring gas for recirculating systems such as RH and DH and for non-recir-
culating systems such as VAD.69 Because of the lower specific flowrates for the stirring gas used
in non-recirculating systems, the time required to remove 50% of the carbon is approximately 7
min, whereas in the RH this time can be as short as 3 to 4 min, Fig. 11.34.
Several methods to enhance the decarburization rate in the RH have been reported.25 Kuwabara et
al.70 were able to increase the decarburization rate by injecting argon through nozzles installed in
the hearth of the RH vessel. By injecting argon at a rate of 400–500 Nl/min the carbon content in
a 100 tonne heat of steel was decreased from 200 to approximately 10 ppm in 20 min, corre-
sponding to kC < 0.15 min–1 as found from equation 11.5.4. This is approximately 50% higher
than kC for a conventional RH, Fig. 11.34.

Yamaguchi et al.72 co-injected hydrogen and argon into the up-leg of the RH to attain 6 ppm hydro-
gen in the steel. The vessel was then evacuated while the injection of hydrogen continued. The evo-
lution of hydrogen gas bubbles within the bath resulted in a final carbon content of 5–10 ppm.
Okada et al.73 reported that top blowing of powders onto the surface of the bath in the RH—the
so-called RH-PB (powder blowing) process—is effective for attaining ultra low carbon, nitrogen
and sulfur contents. For example, by blowing 20–60 kg/min of iron ore powder (–100 mesh)
through a top lance positioned 2–3m above the bath surface the final carbon content attained was
less than 5 ppm.
Whenever the initial carbon content of the steel is relatively high, the decarburization rate may be
limited by the supply of oxygen. To remedy this, the RH-OB (oxygen blowing) and RH-KTB
(Kawasaki Top Blowing) processes were developed. In the RH-OB process the oxygen is supplied
via tuyeres installed in the sidewalls in the lower part of the RH vessel.74 In the RH-KTB process
the oxygen is supplied via a lance situated in the RH vacuum vessel.25 In these configurations of
the RH process skull formation inside the vessel has been minimized by post combustion of the
CO by the injected oxygen.
Yamaguchi et al.75 developed a reaction model for decarburization in the RH and RH-KTB
processes which is based on a mixed control mechanism involving the mass transfer of carbon and
oxygen in the liquid steel present in the vacuum vessel as well as on the transport of carbon and
oxygen by the recirculating steel. The model satisfactorily takes into account the effect of the con-
centration of oxygen on the decarburization rate in the conventional RH as well as in the RH-KTB
process.

(11.5.9)
Bannenberg et al.76 developed a mathematical model for hydrogen removal in a 185 tonne tank
degasser. The agreement between the hydrogen content measured after degassing and that calcu-
lated from the model is excellent, as shown in Fig. 11.35.The model is based on fundamental prin-
ciples. The most critical parameter is the bubble size, which is extremely difficult to predict.
Therefore, the model should only be used to make comparisons for similar operating conditions.
Using the model, Bannenberg et al.76 calculated hydrogen removal rates for initial hydrogen con-
tents varying between 3 and 7 ppm and argon flowrates of 0.9 and 1.8 Nm3/min. The results are sum-
marized in Fig. 11.36 from which it can be seen that it takes 2 to 3 min longer to achieve a given
degree of hydrogen removal for steels initially containing 3 ppm hydrogen than for steels initially
containing 7 ppm hydrogen. Moreover, it is noted that doubling the flowrate of the argon stirring

gas results in a marginally shorter treatment time, e.g. approximately 2 min shorter to achieve 70%
hydrogen removal.
Hydrogen removal rates for tank pressures ranging from 1 to 1000 mbar (~10–1 atm) are shown as
a function of the total volume of argon stirring gas flowing at 1.8 Nm3/min in Fig. 11.37. It is seen
that the final hydrogen content of the steel is essentially unaffected by the tank pressure for pres-
sures up to 10 mbar (~10–2 atm).
From the data depicted in Fig. 11.36 it is found that the overall rate constant for hydrogen removal,
kH, increases from approximately 0.09 to 0.16 min–1, when the argon flowrate increases from 0.9
to 1.8 Nm3/min. The higher kH value is comparable to the value of 0.13 min –1 observed for a RH
vessel2 with a 600 mm diameter snorkel and a steel circulation rate of approximately 140
tonne/min. These values indicate that the efficiencies of recirculating and non-recirculating sys-
tems for the removal of hydrogen are similar.
11.5.3.1 Hydris Probe
In shops where hydrogen-sensitive steel grades such as, for example, large bars, are produced, it is
important to know the hydrogen content of the steel bath before it is delivered to the caster or the
teeming platform. Under such circumstances an in-site determination of the hydrogen content of
the bath in the ladle may be desirable.
Around ten years ago, Plessers et al.79 described an immersion system, the Hydris probe, for the
rapid in-situ determination of hydrogen in a bath of liquid steel. The principle of the measurement
is based on equilibrating a known volume of argon, being passed through the liquid steel, with the
hydrogen dissolved in the steel. Thus, the argon–hydrogen gas mixture leaving the steel after equi-
libration has a partial pressure of hydrogen that, via Sieverts’ law (equation 2.4.8), can be related
to the hydrogen content of the steel. The Hydris probe was tested extensively by Frigm et al.80 who
found that it gave reliable readings of the hydrogen content of the liquid steel with an uncertainty
of approximately ±5%.
The Hydris probe has been in regular use at the Faircrest steel plant of The Timken Company for
a number of years and has been found to be rugged and reliable. The cost associated with the use
of the probe has to be weighed against cost savings made possible by its use such as, for example,
a significant decrease in degassing time to attain the required hydrogen content in the steel.
11.5.4 Nitrogen Removal
Some nitrogen removal from liquid steel during vacuum degassing is possible, provided the steel
is fully killed and has a low sulfur content. Bannenberg et al.76 developed a rate equation for nitro-
gen removal in a 185 tonne tank degasser which was based on a mixed-control model, i.e. liquid-
phase mass transfer of nitrogen to the argon bubbles coupled with chemical reaction control at the
liquid-gas bubble interface. As shown in Fig. 11.38, the nitrogen contents after degassing calcu-
lated from the model and indicated by the solid lines, are in good agreement with the measured
nitrogen contents indicated by the different symbols. Equally good agreement between calculated
and measured values was found for steels containing between 20 and 200 ppm sulfur.77
The rate of nitrogen removal for various initial nitrogen contents as calculated from Bannenberg’s
model is shown in Fig. 11.39 for a killed steel containing 2 ppm dissolved oxygen and 10 ppm sul-
fur and a tank pressure of 1 mbar (~10–3 atm). It can be seen that under these conditions approxi-
mately 50% of the nitrogen can be removed in roughly 15 min, provided the initial nitrogen content
is 50 ppm or higher.
The effect of the steel sulfur content on the rate of nitrogen removal as calculated from
Bannenberg’s model is shown in Fig. 11.40. As with the hydrogen case, the model must be used
carefully due to the uncertainty in bubble size.

Fig. 11.39 Rates of nitrogen removal in a 185 tonne tank degasser calculated from a model. From Ref. 76.

A simplified form of the rate equation for nitrogen removal, equation 2.2.58 is:
(11.5.10)
where kN is the apparent rate constant for denitrogenization for the limiting case in which both
the oxygen and sulfur contents tend to zero. From the nitrogen removal rates shown in Fig. 11.40,
together with equation 2.2.56 for (1 – Q), the apparent rate constant is estimated to be kN <
0.0013 (ppm N min) –1 for 185
tonne heats in a tank degasser at
1 mbar (~10 –3 atm) pressure.
The overall rate constant for de-
nitrogenization 
in 
a 
RH
degasser81 is shown as a function
of the sulfur content of the steel
in Fig. 11.41. It is noted that the
value of kN for sulfur contents
approaching zero is very similar
to the aforementioned value for a
tank degasser. Thus, from these
values it is concluded that recir-
culating and non-recirculating
degassers are equally effective in
removing nitrogen as well as
hydrogen (Section 11.5.3).
Recently, an on-line method for
the determination of the nitro-
gen content of liquid steel has
been developed.89 The system,
called Nitris, is based on the

11.6 Description of Selected Processes
In this section a more detailed description of the most popular processes used in secondary steel-
making operations will be presented. Other, less popular, processes are described in several review
papers.1, 68, 82 This section is concluded with some general remarks concerning process selection.
11.6.1 Ladle Furnace
Ladle furnaces are among the most widely used pieces of equipment in secondary steelmaking
operations and range from relatively simple retrofitted installations83 to elaborately equipped facil-
ities. An example of the latter category is the ladle furnace as originally developed by Daido Steel
Co., shown schematically in Fig. 11.42.84
The ladle furnace illustrated in Fig. 11.42 is lined with a basic lining and covered with a water-
cooled roof. The bath in the ladle is heated with the aid of three electrodes which are supported by
current conducting arms. The process is usually operated with a slag cover on the bath, thus avoid-
ing excessive wear of the ladle lining due to arc radiation. Another advantage of this mode of oper-
ation is that a relatively long arc can be employed, resulting in increased energy efficiency and
lower specific electrode consumption. During reheating the bath is continually stirred by means of
inert gas supplied via a porous plug in the ladle bottom.
The efficiency of reheating a 45 tonne heat of steel in a ladle furnace is shown in Fig. 11.43.84 The
reheating efficiency is between 20 and 30%, depending on the specific energy input. For larger
heat sizes the efficiency can be expected to be higher.
An example of the use of a ladle furnace in conjunction with a degasser is given by Bieniosek.85
The installation and operation of a low budget ladle metallurgy facility at USS/Kobe Steel is dis-
cussed by Mobberly and Diederich.86
11.6.2 Tank Degasser
Steel can be treated in a tank degasser without arc reheating. This is shown schematically in Fig.
11.44 for two different stirring systems. An inductively stirred bath is shown in Fig. 11.44(a) while
in Fig. 11.44(b) the bath is stirred by bubbling argon through a porous plug located in the ladle bot-
tom.
11.6.3 Vacuum Arc Degasser
A vacuum arc degasser (VAD) is a tank degasser with electrodes added for the purpose of reheat-
ing the steel. A schematic illustration of a VAD unit is shown in Fig. 11.45.
Whittaker87 described a VAD process used at Atlas Specialty Steels in which two ladle covers are
used sequentially, shown schematically in Fig. 11.46. During reheating the ladle is placed under-
neath a water cooled steel roof fitted with three electrodes. The cover is not designed to operate
under vacuum. For degassing the ladle is placed underneath a roof fitted with a sight port, vacuum
offtake and a water-cooled O-ring seal. This seal makes the system gastight such that the final pres-
sure inside the ladle can be less than 1 torr (~0.0013 atm). For processing stainless steels the oxy-
gen lance is used and the unit is operated as a VOD.
Another VAD unit that operates with a gastight ladle cover is the Stein-Heurtey–S.A.F.E. System.88
Two such units are in operation at The Timken Company’s steel plants where heat sizes between
approximately 120 and 160 tonnes are processed.

Process control systems for the ladle metallurgy facilities at Dofasco and at LTV’s Indiana Harbor
plant were described by Brown et al.90 and by Rada and Clarkson91, respectively.
11.6.4 RH Degasser
A schematic illustration of the principle of the RH process is depicted in Fig. 11.4792 while a
sketch of a RH unit with ancillary equipment is shown in Fig. 11.48.93 The 145 tonne RH unit
shown in Fig. 11.48 was designed for a monthly steel production of 40,000 tonne, approximately
30% of which represents ULC-IF steel grades.
To increase the availability of the RH installation, many steel shops operate the facility with two
vessels, one of which will be in the operating position while the other is being repaired or relined.
The operation of such a two-vessel facility at Inland Steel Co. was discussed by Schlichting and
Dominik.94
Over the years the RH process was developed further with the aim to enhance the capabilities of
the process. One of the important developments was the addition of oxygen to the RH vessel, either
by injection through a tuyere mounted in the sidewall of the vessel (RH-OB) or via a top lance
inside the vessel (RH-KTB).
Because of the violent splashing occurring inside the RH vessel, skull formation on its inside walls
results. In the RH-KTB process the skull formation is minimized as a result of the heat generated
by the post combustion of CO to CO2, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 11.49.
To enhance the capabilities of the RH process even further, the RH-PB (powder blowing) process
was developed. The addition of powder and/or fluxes makes it possible to desulfurize or dephos-
phorize the steel during the RH operation. Kuwabara et al96 have reported on the injection of fluxes
into the lower part of the ladle during the operation of a RH unit.
Fujii et al.95 studied the effect of fluid flow on the decarburization rate in a RH degasser and related
this to design parameters such as the snorkel and vessel diameters as well as the circulation
flowrate. A control model for the RH degasser was discussed by Sewald92 with emphasis on the

11.6.5 CAS-OB Process
The CAS-OB process (Composition Adjustment by Sealed argon bubbling with Oxygen Blowing)
was developed by Nippon Steel Co. and was recently installed at the Steubenville plant of the
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Co.97 A schematic illustration of a CAS-OB unit is shown in Fig. 11.50.
The main feature of the process is the refractory snorkel or bell underneath which alloy additions to
the bath are made. The ladle is positioned such that the snorkel is situated right above the porous stir-
ring plug, Fig. 11.50. This ensures that the agitated surface of the steel bath is confined to the area
underneath the bell. Additional argon stirring, if necessary, is obtained via a specially shaped sub-
merged lance, Fig. 11.50. Reheating of the steel is accomplished by injecting oxygen through the top
lance in conjunction with aluminum additions. For low-carbon steel the rate of reheating in the

CAS-OB was found to be approximately 10°C/min97 (~20°F/min). This is in broad agreement with
data reported by Palchetti et al.98 who observed a similar reheating rate for an oxygen blowing rate
of approximately 70 Nm3/min (~2470 scfm) for 300 tonne heats.
11.6.6 Process Selection and Comparison
Fruehan68 has addressed the various issues that are involved in the selection of a process, particu-
larly a degassing unit, for a given steel plant. Some of the most important considerations are: future
and current product mix; requirements with respect to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur (phos-
phorus) content of the final product; reheating capability (e.g. does the shop have a ladle furnace);
effect on steelmaking facility (BOF or EAF); degassing time compatible with other operations, e.g.
with sequential continuous casting; and capital and operating costs.
An important issue is to match the time requirement of the degassing unit to the processing times
in the steelmaking furnace (BOF or EAF) and in the continuous caster. For example, to attain a car-
bon content of 0.005% or less requires 10–15 min in an RH-OB (KTB) compared with 15–20 min
in a tank degasser such as a VOD. When such low carbon contents are a frequent requirement, the
installation of an RH-OB (KTB) unit is usually warranted.

Another important issue is the demand on the steelmaking furnace. Ultra-low-carbon steels are eas-
ier to produce in an RH or tank degasser when the initial carbon content (the tap carbon content)
is less than 0.025%. At these low carbon levels the steel contains enough dissolved oxygen to
remove the required amount of carbon in a practical time span. However, having to tap the steel at
such low carbon contents puts an extra load on the BOF with detrimental ramifications in regard
to the vessel lining because of the higher temperature and FeO content of the slag. With an RH-OB
(KTB) or VOD it is possible to tap the steel at higher carbon contents because supplemental oxy-
gen is available for enhanced decarburization, as discussed in Section 11.5.2.1.
Table 11.8 may serve as a first approximation to a semi-quantitative comparison of the various vac-
uum degassing systems68.

12.1 Introduction
Stainless steels contain from 10 to 30% chromium. Varying amounts of nickel, molybdenum, cop-
per, sulfur, titanium, niobium, etc. may be added to obtain desired mechanical properties and ser-
vice life. Stainless steels are primarily classified as austenitic, ferritic, martensitic, duplex or
precipitation hardening grades. The first stainless steel grades that were commercially produced in
the United States were similar to 302, 410, 420, 430, and 446. These five alloys were produced
and marketed prior to 1930. In subsequent years, the grades similar to 303, 304, 316, 321, 347,
416, and 440 were brought to market.
In the early stages of their production, stainless steels were melted using an electric arc furnace.
Stainless steels were made to contain no more than 0.12% carbon. A large fraction of production
of stainless steels was melted to a maximum carbon content of 0.07 or 0.08%.
In those early days, carbon steel scrap, iron ore, and burnt lime were charged into an electric arc
furnace. After the scrap was molten, carbon was removed by adding ore until the carbon content
reached 0.02%. The electrodes were then raised and the slag removed as completely as possible.
Desired amounts of ferrosilicon, burnt lime, and fluorspar were added and the temperature of the
bath was raised so that a large amount of low carbon ferrochromium could be added to achieve the
aim chromium level. The desired amount of the low carbon ferrochromium was added in two or
three separate batches. The bath had to be mixed thoroughly by rabbling or reladling and slag had
to be kept fluid by continuous additions of ferrosilicon, lime and fluorspar. After all the desired
chromium was in the alloy, a sample was taken for preliminary analysis. Final additions were made
and the heat was brought to the desired tapping temperature and tapped.1
Until about 1970, the majority of stainless steel was produced in the arc furnace. With the advent
of tonnage oxygen production, the electric furnace stainless steel melting practice changed from
the above. Gaseous oxygen could be used to improve the rate of decarburization. This could be
achieved by injecting oxygen gas into the liquid steel using a water-cooled lance. The faster oxi-
dation of carbon with high oxygen potential was accompanied by the adverse reaction of extensive
oxidation of chromium to the slag. This necessitated a well-defined reduction period in which fer-
rosilicon was used to reduce the oxidized chromium from the furnace slags.
In the late 1960s, a number of laboratory studies were performed to understand the thermochem-
istry of the stainless steels.2 One of these studies was by Krivsky, who studied the carbon-
chromium-temperature relationships. His experiments involved blowing oxygen onto the surface

of the baths of molten chromium alloys. He was trying to perform the experiments under isother-
mal conditions but found it difficult because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation reactions.
Krivsky added argon to oxygen in order to control the temperature. He found that with argon dilu-
tion he could decarburize the melt to even lower levels of carbon without excessive oxidation of
chromium.3
Krivsky’s observations led to initial experiments where argon-oxygen mixtures were injected
through a lance into the bath in the arc furnace. It was found that argon injection in the wide and
shallow bath of an arc furnace did not influence the decarburization reaction completely as pre-
dicted. Hence, after many experiments, the developers decided that a separate refining vessel was
necessary to develop a commercial process. At Joslyn Steel (now Slater Steels), a 15-ton converter
with three tuyeres was built. The first successful heat was made in October 1967. These success-
ful trials led to patents for the argon-oxygen decarburization (AOD) process for the refining of
stainless steels and other specialty alloys4 by the industrial gases division (now Praxair, Inc.) of
the Union Carbide Corporation.
The AOD process revolutionized stainless steelmaking. It lowered the cost of production of 
stainless steels significantly. It allowed operators to use electric arc furnaces for melting down of

stainless and carbon steel scraps with desired
amounts of low cost high carbon ferrochromium.
The decarburization operation was moved out of
the electric furnace and into the newly designed
converter. The oxidation-reduction operation
could be conducted at very high productivity
rates. Additionally, the quality of the alloys pro-
duced was improved. The process was adopted
by major stainless producers at a very rapid rate.
As shown in Fig. 12.1, the AOD process is the
predominant method for making stainless steel
in the world.5 A schematic of a modern AOD
vessel is shown in Fig. 12.2.
Duplex processes are used for making stain-
less steels. There is an electric arc furnace or
similar melting unit that melts down scrap, fer-
roalloys and other raw materials to produce the
hot metal. The hot metal, which contains most

of the chromium and nickel as well as some other alloying elements, is the charge to the convert-
ers. The converters are used to achieve low carbon stainless steels which may be tapped into a
teeming ladle. The EAF-AOD process is one such duplex route. The versatility of the AOD process
led steelmakers to re-examine the use of different converters for melting of stainless steels. This
led to the development of several other converters for duplex processes. These include:  KCB-S6
process developed by Krupp Stahl, shown in Fig. 12.3; K-BOP7 process used by Kawasaki Steel
Corporation; K-OBM-S8 promoted by Voest Alpine; metal refining process (MRP)9 developed by
Mannesmann Demag; Creusot-Loire-Uddeholm

(TMBI)12 process used by Allegheny Ludlum
Corporation; VODC13 process tried by Thyssen
where vacuum is applied to the converter; and
AOD/VCR14 process developed by Daido,
shown in Fig. 12.5.
The development work to make stainless steels
using conventional BOF converters had begun
in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By the mid-
1960s, some steelmakers were using existing
BOF converters for a partial decarburization
followed by decarburization in a ladle under
vacuum to make the low carbon stainless
steels. These processes are known as triplex
processes because three process units, such as
electric arc furnace, a converter for pre-blow-
ing, and a vacuum decarburization unit for
final refining, are involved. The steels undergo

treatment for final decarburization, final trimming, homogenization and flotation of inclusions
before the ladle is taken to the teeming operation. In almost all of these triplex processes, vacuum
processing steels in the teeming ladle is the final step before casting. The vacuum oxygen decar-
burization (VOD) process was developed by Thyssen in West Germany.15 The other processes using
vacuum include the use of RH-OB for making stainless steels at Nippon Steel Corporation16 and the
use of an SS-VOD process17 by Kawasaki Steel Corporation. These processes are shown in Fig. 12.6.
With all these developments over several decades, now there are many different processes to make
stainless steels. The available processes can be divided into three groups: the converter processes,
converter with vacuum processes, and vacuum processes. Table 12.1 shows the variety of
processes.

In the following sections, the various processes for making stainless steels are discussed. First,
there is a brief discussion of the general principles of refining stainless steels, followed by an
examination of process routes. Then the melting of scrap and raw materials is described. Melting
methods are common to all the duplex and triplex routes for making stainless steels. Most steel
plants use electric arc furnaces for melting scrap and raw materials. Alternative technologies such
as a direct current furnace, a plasma furnace or a similar melting unit can serve the same purpose.
The balance of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of refining methods.

As discussed in Chapter 2, stainless steel decarburization must account for or minimize the oxida-
tion of chromium. It is generally accepted, that when oxygen is injected into stainless steel, a mix-
ture of chromium and iron is oxidized.18, 19 Decarburization occurs when dissolved carbon reduces
the chromium and iron oxides that form. The decarburization sequence is thus:
3/2O2(g) + 2Cr ® Cr2O3
(12.2.1)
Cr2O3 + 3C ® 2Cr + 3CO(g)
(12.2.2)
Decarburization occurs on the surface of rising bubbles that form from either the inert gas that is
injected or on the suface of chromium oxide particles that are being reduced and generating CO. 
The decarburization of stainless steel involves techniques to minimize chromium oxidation. There
are three basic techniques: temperature, dilution, and vacuum.

The temperature technique was used by electric arc furnace stainless steelmaking before the devel-
opment of duplex methods. As shown in Chapter 2, Section 2.9.1, as the temperature increases, the
equilibrium carbon content at a particular chromium content decreases. As discussed above, how-
ever, this leads to operational difficulties and high costs.
The dilution technique is that used by the AOD and all converter processes. The injection of inert
gas (argon or nitrogen) lowers the partial pressure of CO in the bath, thus allowing higher chromium
contents to be in equilibrium with lower carbon contents, as shown in Chapter 2, Section 2.9.1.
Applying a vacuum to the metal bath also removes CO, allowing high chromium contents to be in
equilibrium with low carbon contents. It is especially effective when the carbon content is low.
Careful manipulation of the slag, as it participates in the reaction, is important. Any chromium
oxide not reduced by carbon ends up in the slag, which can form a complex spinel. Subsequent pro-
cessing (called reduction) is required to recover oxidized elements such as chromium, iron, man-
ganese, etc. The effectiveness of the reduction step is dependent on many factors including slag
basicity and composition, temperature, mixing conditions in the vessel and solid addition dissolu-
tion kinetics.20 Chapter 2, Section 2.9.3 describes these reactions in more detail.
12.3 Selection of a Process Route
As outlined earlier, there are many different process routes available for stainless steel melting and
refining. The steelmaker has to choose from these routes based on many factors which determine
capital costs as well as operating costs. The choice of process route is influenced by raw material
availability, desired product, downstream processing, existing shop logistics, and capital economics.
In general, some degree of flexibility in process route is desirable, as these factors can change
rapidly. In general, stainless steelmaking process flow can be classified as duplex or triplex. The
comparison of these two processes is shown in Fig. 12.7. Duplex refining, where electric arc furnace

melting is followed by refining in a converter, tends to be flexible with respect to raw material
selection. Triplex refining, where electric arc furnace melting and converter refining is followed by
refining with a vacuum system, is often desirable when the final product has very low carbon and
nitrogen specifications.21 Triplex refining tends to have overall cycle times longer than duplex
refining because there is an extra transfer from refining converter to vacuum unit. It also tends to
have slightly higher refractory costs because there are two vessels performing decarburization.
Raw material availability affects the choice of process route. For example, high argon costs shift
the economics of stainless production away from dilution type processes in favor of vacuum
processes. A lack of scrap forces the use of more high carbon ferrochrome, increasing the carbon
load in the charge. In such a case, process routes that have high decarburization rates would be
favored. Lack of scrap, which can be used for cooling the bath, also can favor processes that are
not thermally efficient, as there is no economical addition for cooling the bath. Where scrap and
ferroalloys are expensive or unavailable, process routes have been developed that use chromium
ore and blast furnace or similar hot metal.22, 23 These processes typically incorporate a smelting
unit, often a converter, to reduce the ore, followed by decarburization in another converter, possi-
bly followed by vacuum processing.
The desired product mix affects the choice of process. High production levels of ultra low carbon
and nitrogen stainless steels tend to favor vacuum processes to avoid high argon consumption. For
typical levels of carbon and nitrogen in stainless steels, the processing cost are usually lower for
the converter processes than vacuum or triplex processes.
Downstream processing considerations also will affect the choice of process. Sequence continuous
casting requires a stainless steel refining route that will provide feed metal at the proper tempera-
ture, composition and time to sequence cast.
Availability of ladle furnaces and ladle stations can shift some of the non-decarburization time
from the refining vessel to the ladle furnace or station. Some high productivity shops tap the heat
out of the converter just after the reduction stage. The final additions are made to the ladle. This
frees up the refining vessel for the next heat.
If existing melting capacity is insufficient for desired production levels, the refining process may
need to melt large amounts of cold material. This would favor processes that are thermally efficient
or ones that can generate heat for melting. If melting is primarily by induction furnaces, raw mate-
rial choices may be limited. Blast furnace or hot metal availability would also influence the type
of refining process. Available vacuum or baghouse capacity may influence the choice between vac-
uum or dilution methods. Crane capacity may limit vessel size. Crane traffic and shop layout will
affect process flow. Existing ladle cars can help or hinder material movement. An existing contin-
uous caster also would affect process choice.
Cost of capital always affects process choices. Systems for making alloy additions can be very expen-
sive. Baghouse and vacuum capacity is also expensive. There is often a balance between capital and
operational cost. The process with the lower operating cost sometimes has the highest capital cost.
In some recent installations, capital spending considerations have eclipsed those of all other fac-
tors, including flexibility and operating costs, in the selection of process route. For major turnkey
installations, which may include steel melting, refining, casting, hot and cold rolling, anneal and
pickle lines, as well as the associated technology, the choice of equipment suppliers is limited to
three or four large firms. Each of these suppliers aggressively promotes its own secondary steel-
making process as superior relative to operating costs, quality, productivity, etc. However, several
of these suppliers will manufacture and install a version of any other type of secondary steelmak-
ing, if the customer insists. Depending on geographical location, order backlogs, previous equip-
ment sales, manpower availability, etc., any one of these suppliers may be in a better position to
manufacture and install equipment at a substantially lower price than the others.
For maximum flexibility, a shop should have a process flow that can incorporate a duplex or triplex
route. This offers the most flexibility in raw materials, production capability, and process flow. In

this case, only products that require vacuum refining for economic and/or quality reasons will use
a triplex route.
12.4 Raw Materials
Raw materials used in all stainless steel making operations can be divided into two main groups;
nonmetallic raw materials and metallic raw materials. The nonmetallic materials typically needed
are burnt lime, dolomitic lime and flurospar. The metallic raw materials needed are stainless steel
scrap, carbon steel scrap and a variety of alloying materials and deoxidizers. The major alloying
materials used are chromium, nickel, manganese and silicon additives.
Ferrochromium is the prime source of  chromium and it comes in a range of addition agents. The
common chromium alloying materials charged to the electric arc furnace and AOD are given in
Table 12.3.
Nickel is present in significant amounts in the AISI 200 and 300 series stainless steels. In addition
to austenitic stainless steel scrap, nickel is available as electrolytic nickel, nickel powder, nickel
oxide, briquetted nickel and ferronickel. Typical analyses of nickel containing raw materials are
given in Table 12.4.
Manganese is present in significant amounts in the AISI 200 series of alloys. Sources of manganese
are given in Table 12.5.

Silicon is used in all the stainless steel making processes to chemically reduce the chromium which
is present in the slag at the end of the decarburization period. For this purpose, silicon is added in
the reduction mix as ferrosilicon or ferrochromiumsilicon. Additional silicon would be needed to
meet any silicon specification on many of these stainless steels. The most common raw materials
used to supply the silicon are its ferroalloys which contain nominally either 50% silicon or 75%
silicon.
Molybdenum is added to some of the stainless steel grades. The materials which can be used to add
molybdenum include molybdenum oxide in powder or briquette form and ferromolybdenum.
Aluminum is a common deoxidant and high purity aluminum pig or bar is added for this purpose.
Titanium is a very frequent addition to many stainless steel grades for the purpose of stabilization
(see Chapter 11). The most commonly used alloys of titanium are 70%Ti–30%Fe and
90%Ti–4%V–5%%Al alloy. The other elements which are generally added in the ladle include car-
bon, sulfur, nitrogen, niobium (columbium), tungsten and copper. Selenium and tantalum are
added to a very limited number of grades.
In stainless steelmaking, most of the cost of the final product is due to raw materials. Over more
than the past two decades, computer programs, most of which use linear programming techniques,
have been developed and used to utilize the raw materials in such a way that the total raw material
cost of production is minimized. 
12.5 Melting
For the electric arc furnace, typical charges are scrap and ferroalloys. As there is further refining,
least cost charges incorporate high carbon ferroalloys for chromium and manganese units.
Usually, the least cost source of material is used; for scrap this may consist of oily turnings and
furnace skulls.
Sometimes, hot metal from the blast furnace or other iron source is available. In this case, the
electric arc furnace can be used to melt only ferroalloys with the resulting melt then mixed with
the molten iron in a converter process for refining.22 The electric arc furnace can also be bypassed
altogether.
When hot metal is the source and stainless scrap or ferroalloys are unavailable or too expensive,
then chromium, manganese and nickel ores can be used as sources of material.23, 24
12.5.1 Electric Arc Furnace Melting
The delivery of molten material for further processing requires melting facilities of some kind. The
electric arc furnace is by far the most popular choice due to its flexibility of raw material sources
and widespread use. Induction melting is popular in smaller shops and foundries; however, it is less
capable of handling some scrap sources, such as turnings and oily scrap.
The job of the melter, be it electric arc furnace or other method, is to melt down the basic raw mate-
rials as quickly and economically as possible. The potential of chromium oxidation places some
limits on the use of oxygen injection into the arc furnace. Carbon injection and foamy slag prac-
tices, while common in the carbon steel industry, are rarely employed in stainless steels. The slags
that form in the melting of stainless are high in chromium oxide and are not as fluid as carbon steel
slags. The stainless steel melt slags do not foam as easily.25 CO generation for formation of the
foamy slags also does not occur if the chromium content is high.
Stainless steel melt charges in the United States are primarily scrap based. Scrap stainless steel is
often a cheaper source of chromium and nickel units than virgin material such as ferrochromium
and nickel.
Melting of stainless steel is a choice of the least cost sources of metal units. There is usually some
consideration of impurities such as copper and phosphorus, which are not removed during subse-
quent processing.

For a 300 series stainless steel, a typical melt-in mixture might consist of:  50% 300 series scrap
(18%Cr, 8%Ni, 1%Mn); 30% carbon steel scrap;14% high carbon ferrochrome (7%C, 65%Cr); 4%
nickel (commercial purity); and 1% high carbon ferromanganese (7%C, 65%Mn).
At melt-in, this mixture would yield about 18%Cr, 8%Ni, 1%Mn and 1%C.
In the early stages of melting, some shops will use burners and oxygen lancing. The added energy
input increases the melt-in rate in the early stages of melting. After the second bucket however,
burner and oxygen use is limited to avoid chromium oxidation. At tap, ferrosilicon is often added
to recover oxidized chromium from the slag.
12.5.2 Converter Melting
Converter melting requires oxygen and carbon injection coupled with post-combustion to generate
heat. Converter melting is rarely economical but high electrical power costs or lack of electric melt-
ing capacity, combined with hot metal availability, may make this option viable.
In converter melting, molten hot metal is charged into a smelting converter and the ores added.
Carbon is also injected or charged as the reductant and as fuel. Oxygen is injected by a lance for
burning carbon and post-combustion. This generates the heat necessary for the smelting reaction.
Ores typically contain some amount of gangue, so appropriate slag conditioners are also added.
The slag is decanted and the metal, now close to the desired composition, is transferred to another
converter for refining.
12.6 Dilution Refining Processes
The melting processes supply the liquid stainless steel, which now contains desired amounts of
chromium, nickel and other alloying elements, to the next process step. The latter is directed at
decarburizing the stainless steel alloy to the desired carbon content. It is accompanied by oxidation
of chromium, iron, silicon, aluminum, titanium and manganese which are present in the charge. In
a converter, decarburization is carried out using the dilution principle. There are different convert-
ers based on the gases used. Another difference is whether the vessel is side or bottom-blown.
Proponents of side blowing argue that side blowing results in higher carbon removal efficiencies
(amount of oxygen reacting with carbon divided by the total amount of gases blown) in the range
of 0.1 to 0.005% carbon, due to longer inert gas bubble residence time, and improved desulfuriza-
tion in the range of 0.005% to less than 0.001% sulfur due to improved mixing.
The most popular converters for making stainless steels are AOD, KCB-S, K-BOP/K-OBM-S,
MRP and CLU. Each of these are discussed in the following sections.
12.6.1 Argon-Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) Converter Process
The AOD process, shown in Fig. 12.2, is used for the production of stainless steel in the second
step of a duplex process. The molten steel, which contains most of the chromium and nickel needed
to meet the final heat composition, is tapped from the electric arc furnace into a transfer ladle. The
transfer ladle is lifted with a crane and the liquid steel is poured into the AOD vessel. The vessel
can be rotated downwards so that the side mounted tuyeres are above the bath level during charg-
ing of the liquid steel. In the early days of the AOD process, the vessel was tilted for making raw
material additions as well as for taking samples and temperature measurements using immersion
thermocouples. The desire to increase the productivity has led to continuous charging of raw mate-
rials during the blow periods as well as reduction periods. Modern instrumentation has been devel-
oped which can take melt samples as well as steel temperatures using a specially designed
sub-lance with the vessel in the upright position.
Typical consumptions26 of an 80-ton AOD making AISI 304 are shown in the Table 12.6.

A major modification of the original AOD process involves the use of a top-blowing lance in addi-
tion to the side blowing tuyeres. The lance can be used to inject oxygen at desired flow rates to
increase decarburization and/or for post-combustion. The top lance can also be designed for blow-
ing mixed gases such as inert-oxygen gas mixtures. The installation of a lance and introduction of
oxygen in the early stages of decarburization can reduce the time for a heat. The technology can
be used to increase productivity, in tons per hour, of a melt shop.
Another modification of the AOD involves applying vacuum on the converter to reduce the argon
and silicon consumption as well as process time when making low carbon grades. This modifica-
tion is identified as AOD-VCR and is used by Daido Steel, Japan.
12.6.2 K-BOP and K-OBM-S
Kawasaki Steel Corporation’s K-BOP process began as a conventional top oxygen blown BOF. It was
modified to have seven bottom tuyeres of the OBM (Q-BOP) type. These tuyeres could blow oxygen
with propane for tuyere cooling. Powdered lime could also be injected through these tuyeres. 
In its initial development stage, an 85 ton ultra-high-powered electric arc furnace (UHP-EAF) was
used to supply the hot metal to the reactor. The top and bottom oxygen blowing was used to achieve
high decarburization rates.27
Kawasaki Steel Corporation continued the developmental work where chromium ore and coke
were added to the reactor. The reactor was thus used for reduction of chromium ore and after that
switched over to decarburization operation. Additional developmental work at Kawasaki Steel led
to a smelt reduction process for stainless steelmaking using separate reactors. Final decarburiza-
tion (below 0.10%C) was carried out in a top-blown RH degassing unit (the KTB process).
Eventually a process using separate converters and a VOD unit was developed. The later develop-
ment is discussed later in Section 12.8 on direct stainless steelmaking.
The K-OBM-S process developed by Voest Alpine Industrieanlagenbau (VAI) and evolved from
Kawasaki’s K-BOP process. The K-OBM-S process initiated with tuyeres installed in the con-
verter bottom. However, two recent installations, POSCO in Korea28 and Bolzano in Italy, are
side-blown reactors.29 Thus, a K-OBM-S converter is top-blown with a lance and bottom or side-
blown with tuyeres. It is very similar to a modern AOD. However, in the K-OBM-S process,
hydrocarbons, such as natural gas or propane, are used for tuyere protection and this can be

helpful in increasing the refractory life. Typical consumptions and conditions21 for making AISI
304 are given in Table 12.7.
12.6.3 Metal Refining Process (MRP) Converter
The metal refining process was developed by Mannesmann Demag Huttentechnik. It is also a
duplex process where scrap and raw materials are melted in an electric arc furnace or similar unit.
Molten metal, which contains chromium and nickel, is charged to the MRP converter.
Decarburization is carried out using oxygen and inert gases. In early stages of development, the
gases were alternately blown through the tuyeres in the bottom of the reactor.30, 31 The oxygen is
blown into the melt without dilution with any inert gas. The desired oxygen blow is followed by
blowing with inert gas only. The cycle of oxygen blow followed by inert blow is called cyclic refin-
ing or pulsing and the developers claim that the flushing with pure inert gases can lead to achiev-
ing low CO partial pressure and faster decarburization and thus lower chromium oxidation and
consumption of silicon for reduction. The original version of the converter has now evolved into
the MRP-L process in which all oxygen is top-blown and inert gas is injected through the porous
elements in the bottom.
The developers claim that the process can use higher blowing rates than those used in the AOD
process, which has sidewall tuyeres. The bottom tuyeres can be replaced easily through the use of
an exchangeable bottom. With bottom tuyeres, there is less likely to be erosion on the sidewalls of
the vessel.
In recent years, the MRP-L units have been coupled with a vacuum unit as part of the triplex
process for making stainless steels, especially those requiring lower carbon and nitrogen levels. In
these plants, the heats are tapped at an intermediate carbon level appropriate for subsequent vac-
uum decarburization.
12.6.4 Creusot-Loire-Uddeholm (CLU) Converter 
The CLU Process is similar to the AOD process for making stainless steels. It also uses liquid steel
from an electric arc furnace or similar melter. The major impetus for its development was the idea
to substitute steam as the diluting gas rather than argon. The process was developed by Uddeholm
of Belgium and Creusot-Loire of France. The converter is bottom-blown thus differentiating it from
the side-blown AOD converter. The first commercial plant using the CLU process was built in 1973
by Uddeholm, now a part of Avesta-Sheffield Stainless Co. The process is also used by Samancor
in South Africa for the production of medium carbon ferrochrome. Columbus Stainless in
Middleburg, South Africa chose this process, supplied by VAI, for their newest stainless plant,
which came on stream in 1996.32

The decarburization period consists of injecting an oxygen-steam mixture. The process is energy
inefficient as the reaction of steam with the molten steel bath is endothermic. Chromium oxidation
is higher than in the AOD process when decarburization is continued below about 0.18% carbon.
Although the original goal of reducing argon consumption can be met, the increased silicon
requirement for the reduction step does not necessarily lead to overall cost savings. Further, the use
of steam throughout the entire period was found to lead to undesirable hydrogen contents in the
refined steel. Therefore, practices have evolved which use various amounts of steam, argon, and
nitrogen in the process. Consumptions and conditions32 for two grades are given in Table 12.8.
12.6.5 Krupp Combined Blowing-Stainless (KCB-S) Process
The production of stainless steels in the BOF converter using the top lance was being practiced
prior to the advent of the AOD Process.33, 34 After introduction of the AOD process, Krupp Stahl
AG modified the converter at its Bochum Works so that combined blowing through the lance and
tuyeres could be practiced for refining stainless steels. The process was named Krupp combined
blowing-stainless or KCB-S. The simultaneous introduction of process gases helped them increase
the decarburization rate. The blowing through a top lance and through the tuyeres below the bath
surface helped achieve very high decarburization rates. The increased decarburization rate led to a
reduction of up to 30% in the refining times compared to a conventional AOD alone.28 The
schematic diagram of the KCB-S process is shown in Fig. 12.3.
Liquid steel from an electric arc furnace is charged to the converter. At the start of the blow, pure
oxygen is injected simultaneously through the lance and sidewall tuyeres. After a desired process
temperature is reached, various additions are made during the blow. The additions consist of lime,
ferroalloys, and scrap. After a critical carbon level is reached, the oxygen content of the process gas
is reduced by using inert gases such as nitrogen or argon. Oxygen to inert gas ratios of 4:1, 2:1, 1:1,
1:2 and 1:4 are used as decarburization to lower levels is pursued. When the carbon content of
0.15% is reached, the use of the lance is discontinued and the process gases are introduced only
through the tuyeres. When the desired aim carbon level is reached, the oxygen blow is discontin-
ued and silicon is added as ferrosilicon to reduce the chromium oxide in the slag and to achieve the
required silicon specification. The addition of lime and other fluxing agents with the ferrosilicon
leads to lowering of the dissolved oxygen content and enhances the desulfurization.
12.6.6 Argon Secondary Melting (ASM) Converter
This process was developed by MAN GHH in Germany.35 It is similar to the AOD process, except
that the tuyeres are in the bottom of the vessel. When using top-blown oxygen, it is identified as
the ASM-L process.

12.6.7 Sumitomo Top and Bottom Blowing Process (STB) Converter
Sumitomo Metal Industries developed the Sumitomo top and bottom blowing process (STB). It
was developed to overcome the disadvantages of a pure top or pure bottom blowing process by
combining the two concepts into one process.36, 37 It also tried to overcome two disadvantages of
the AOD process at the time:  tuyere erosion and limited oxygen flow rate. The additional supply
of oxygen rich gases from the top lance led to shorter decarburization times compared to the AOD
process as practiced in late 1970s. The process was developed in a 250-ton converter in the No.2
steelmaking shop at Kashima Works. The process was renamed Sumitomo metal refining (SMR)
and used for a short time in the 160 ton converter at Wakayama Works.
12.6.8 Top Mixed Bottom Inert (TMBI) Converter
Allegheny Ludlum Corporation used a BOF converter to make ferritic stainless steels whenever
incremental stainless steel capacity was necessary.38 In the early stage of development, oxygen,
and oxygen-argon mixtures were introduced through a supersonic top lance. However, the process
was less efficient than the AOD process. Consequently, one BOF converter was equipped with bot-
tom tuyeres to inject only inert gases such as argon or nitrogen. The majority of the process gas
was introduced through the top lance. The top lance could be used to introduce the desired mixture
of gases. The process was called top mixed bottom inert (TMBI). The process is similar to the other
processes that use combined gas blowing in a converter. The particular plant operated by Allegheny
Ludlum has coreless induction furnaces that melt carbon steel scrap and supply chromium-free hot
metal to the BOF converters.
12.6.9 Combined Converter and Vacuum Units
The converter processes discussed above have one disadvantage in that stainless steels with very
low carbon and nitrogen residuals become difficult to produce. The decarburization period
becomes longer while chromium oxidation and argon consumption increase as the desired carbon
and nitrogen levels decrease. Some steelmakers have tried to overcome this disadvantage by apply-
ing vacuum to the converter at the very late stages of the decarburization process. The concept was
tried in an evacuated BOF by Thyssen in the early 1970s. The concept was also promoted by
Leybould-Heraus as an alternative to AOD or VOD. The concept of applying vacuum to a converter
is being pursued by the installation of AOD/VCR by Daido at Shibukawa and Chita39 plants and
by Nippon Steel at its Hikari works.40 A schematic of the converter was shown earlier in Fig. 12.5.
The AOD-VCR operates as a conventional AOD down to 0.08–0.10%C. The process is stopped for
sampling and a vacuum lid is put into place. The lid is sealed to a flange located about half way up
the conical section of the converter. A vacuum is pulled and used for the remainder of decarbur-
ization and reduction. Desulfurization is carried out in the transfer ladle prior to AOD charge. The
major advantages of this process relative to converter processes are decreased argon and silicon
consumption. Disadvantages include higher refractory consumption, decreased ability to melt
scrap and added maintenance and costs associated with steam production.
When compared to separate converter and VOD units, the AOD-VCR has higher operating costs
(silicon, refractory, and argon), lower productivity and higher nitrogen contents. Capital costs may
be somewhat lower than having two separate units.
12.7 Vacuum Refining Processes
The use of vacuum for decarburization of steels was developed by different steelmakers in
Germany. The early processes included RH degassing, DH degassing, and the Allegheny vacuum
refining (AVR) as a second step in the duplex process. These processes involve lowering the pres-
sure above the steel bath to promote evolution of carbon monoxide gas. The liquid stainless steels
going into the vacuum process generally contain carbon of about 0.5% or lower. Most vacuum

processes are performed in a chamber with a ladle full of metal as opposed to a separate refining
vessel used in the dilution/converter processes.
In mid 1960s, the vacuum decarburization concept was used by Allegheny Ludlum Steel
Corporation to develop the Allegheny vacuum refining process. It was used to make the regular
grades of stainless steels and lowered the consumption of low carbon ferrochrome associated with
the oxidation-reduction practice used in the electric arc furnace. This process became non-com-
petitive with the introduction of the AOD process. In late 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum built a plant
with an AOD reactor and discontinued the use of the AVR process.
Early duplex processes where vacuum processing was used as the second step were too slow and
had very limited flexibility with respect to raw materials that could be used. The vacuum processes
could not keep up with the improving productivity of electric arc melting furnaces and the operat-
ing costs were very high. Hence, later developments focused on the use of converters to decarbur-
ize the molten metal from electric arc furnaces as a second stage followed by vacuum degassing
for the finishing stage. Such processes are known as triplex processes for making stainless steels
as they use three processes to achieve the desired finished chemistry.
Nippon Steel Corporation introduced the RH-OB process for making of stainless steels in the
Muroran Works.41 Hot metal from a blast furnace was fed to a BOF converter where the metal was
alloyed with chromium and blown down to a 0.5–0.6% carbon level. The final decarburization was
conducted using the RH-OB process. Nippon Steel converted an existing RH degasser, which was
used for carbon steels, so that oxygen could be injected under vacuum.
Edelstahlwerk Witten (now Thyssen) in Germany developed the vacuum oxygen decarburization
(VOD) process in the mid-1960s. In the early stages of its development, VOD was used to decar-
burize molten alloy from the electric arc furnace. Later, preliminary decarburization was done in a
BOF and the EAF-BOF-VOD triplex process became more productive. In early 1970s, Kawasaki
Steel Corporation modified the VOD process using multiple porous plug bubblers in the ladle.
They called this the SS-VOD (strong stirring VOD) process.42 In 1988, ALZ in Belgium modified
the facilities to make stainless steels by a triplex process consisting of electric arc furnace melting,
metal refining process-lance (MRP-L) converter, and vacuum oxygen decarburization (VOD)
process.43
The major advantages of the vacuum processes include low consumption of argon and low oxida-
tion of chromium during the final decarburization to low carbon levels. The latter leads to less con-
sumption of reduction elements for recovering chromium from slag. The teeming of steel from the
ladle used in the vacuum processes eliminates the pickup of nitrogen and oxygen from air that is
associated with tapping of the converters. The SS-VOD process, because of the strong stirring
achieved using multiple bubblers in the ladle, further enhanced the ability to produce even lower
levels of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen at higher chromium levels.
A major disadvantage of VOD processing is that it is less flexible than an AOD or other converter
process with respect to raw materials usage. Typical additions to the VOD are around 4–8% of tap
weight. Typical vacuum treatment times are 50 to 70 minutes with start carbon contents of 0.3%,
compared with 40 to 60 minutes with a converter starting at 1.5 to 2.5%C. This added time makes
it difficult to sequence continuous casting of heats.
Many steelmakers have also realized that vacuum processes often have high operating costs and
cannot compete with the ease of operating a converter process at atmospheric pressure. However,
the vacuum processes, especially the SS-VOD process, have the unique ability of achieving lower
carbon and nitrogen levels in stainless steels which cannot be easily achieved by the AOD process
or other converter processes.
12.8 Direct Stainless Steelmaking
In recent years, there have been efforts to use chromium and nickel ores for stainless steelmaking
in lieu of the ferroalloys. In Japan, a number of companies have developed and are using such

processes commercially. In particular, Kawasaki Steel Corporation (KSC) has developed a process
which smelts chromite ore (FeCr2O4 plus other oxides). Stainless steel is produced with two 160
ton converters, without any EAF operation, but using dephosphorized hot metal, chromite ore and
ferroalloys as the major charge materials. An outline of the KSC process is shown in Fig. 12.8. The
hot metal is desulfurized and then fed into a K-BOP/K-OBM vessel (SR-KCB) which is described
in Chapter 9. Chromite pellets, which are partially prereduced up to 60% chromium content by
rotary kiln, are charged to the first reactor. Coke is also charged and serves as a heat source in the
reactor. The charging rate of ore and coke and the oxygen blow rate are controlled to achieve suit-
able temperature for the melt.44, 45
The steel melt, which now contains about 11–16% Cr and 5–6% C is charged to the second K-
BOP/K-OBM vessel. Primary decarburization (DC-KCB) is carried out using oxygen, argon and
nitrogen gases in this vessel. Top and bottom oxygen blowing is used to lower the carbon content
of the melt to about the 1% level. This is followed by mixed gas blowing only from the bottom.
This is called the DC-KCB process and is similar to a modern AOD operation. The process reduces
the carbon to about 0.15%. Final decarburization and reduction is carried out in a VOD. The
process uses less amount of scraps than the EAF-AOD process route. However, it requires liquid
hot metal from a blast furnace and more process steps and more capital investment than the EAF-
AOD route.
NKK Corp. has developed and commercialized a similar process which also smelts both chromite
and nickel ore.46 After hot metal dephosphorization, the metal is transferred to a smelting furnace

and nickel ore is smelted. As a nickel ore typically contains 1–3% nickel, a considerable amount of
ore is added and the slag must be removed several times to achieve the desired nickel level. After
reaching the required nickel content, chromite or chromium ore is smelted. The smelting takes about
six hours; four for nickel and two for chromium. This is followed by the decarburization period.
Similar to the KSC process, the NKK process uses less scrap and only a small amount of nickel
metal and ferrochrome. However, the process requires hot metal and a very long process time.
These direct stainless steelmaking processes require less scrap and ferroalloys and may be consid-
ered when the stainless scrap and ferroalloys are not readily available in sufficient quantities.
However, chromium and nickel ores are needed and can be used in an integrated steel plant where
the hot metal is available. The processes are more capital intensive than the other processes.
Therefore, their implementation in other plants and locations is likely to be limited.
12.9 Equipment for EAF-AOD Process
The previous three sections outlined the concepts of different processes to make stainless steels.
The EAF-AOD, EAF-CLU and similar duplex process routes are the most popular for making
stainless steels. This section describes the equipment used in the EAF-AOD process route, which
is by far the most popular process in the world for making stainless steels.
For converter refining processes, the vessel consists of a refractory-lined steel shell. Several types
and qualities of basic refractory have been used in converter vessels. Refer to Chapter 4 for more
details of stainless steelmaking refractories.
Process gases are injected through submerged tuyeres that are installed in the sidewall or bottom
of the vessel. Sidewall injection imparts maximum stirring energy to the bath for greatest effi-
ciency of mixing. Bottom injection usually improves wear characteristics in the barrel section of
the vessel. The number and relative positioning of tuyeres is determined in part by vessel size,
range of heat sizes, process gas flow rates and the types of alloys refined. Process gases are oxy-
gen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, air, hydrocarbons and argon. Most recent converter installations
include the use of a top lance for blowing oxygen.
The gas control system supplies the process gases at nominal rates of 1.0–3.0 Nm3/min/ton
(2000–6000 scfh/ton). The system accurately controls the flowrates and monitors the amount of gas
injected into the bath to enable the operator to control the process and measure the total oxygen
injected. In contrast, vacuum processes typically use much lower total input rates, e.g., 0.02–0.6
Nm3/min/ton (typical top oxygen blow rate 0.3–0.4 Nm3/min/ton) and seldom use gases other than
oxygen, nitrogen and argon.
A high production shop will typically have three interchangeable vessels for 100% availability of
the process. At any given time, one of the vessels is in the tiltable trunnion ring refining steel, a
second newly lined vessel is at a preheating station, and the third vessel is at a reline station. The
vessel in the trunnion ring typically can be replaced with a preheated vessel in less than an hour.
Process gas control, vessel activities and ancillary equipment can range from manual to fully auto-
mated. Most installations are equipped with a computer for calculating oxygen requirements as
well as alloy additions. Some installations have computer controls capable of setting flow rates to
the gas control system.
12.9.1 Vessel Size and Shape
The converter vessel consists of a refractory-lined steel shell.47 With a removable, conical cover in
place, the vessel outline is sometimes described as pear-shaped. Modified BOF vessels have also
been used. As molten stainless steels do not generate foam, and most stainless steel refining
processes are side or bottom-blown, the dimensions of a stainless refining converter are  smaller
than a comparable tonnage BOF or OBM (Q-BOP). Typical internal volumes of stainless steel
refining converter vessels are in the range 0.4–0.8 m3/metric ton bath weight.

For vessels that tap into a ladle held by a crane, a sliced cone top section is often used. The slice
portion allows the crane to come close to the vessel mouth. Fig. 12.2 shows an AOD vessel with a
sliced cone top section. Vessels that tap into a ladle car usually have a BOF-type concentric cone
top section.
12.9.2 Refractories
High temperatures at the tuyere tip and high bath agitation place great demands on the vessel
refractory.48 While typical BOF refractory campaigns are months or years long, stainless converter
campaigns are several days or weeks long. Refractory costs are a significant fraction of total oper-
ating costs.
There are two basic choices of refractory type, magnesite-chromite, and dolomite. The choice of
refractory is dependent on the vessel operation pattern, final product specifications, and economics.
Magnesite-chromite refractories have high wear resistance but have a higher unit cost than
dolomitic refractories. Chromium pickup from the brick is possible. Magnesite-chromite bricks are
simultaneously acidic and basic and strict slag compositions must be maintained to prevent rapid
wear.49,50,51
Dolomitic refractories are usually less costly than magnesite-chromite refractories and chromium
pickup is not a factor. Desulfurization to very low levels is generally easier in dolomitic refracto-
ries because very basic slags can be used without detrimental effects to the brick.52 Most major
stainless producers in the United States and Europe use dolomitic refractories in the converter.
Vessels are typically zoned by thickness and brick quality to maximize lining life and minimize
costs. High wear areas of the vessel, usually the tuyere wall, slag line, and transfer pad (where the
metal stream strikes the vessel during transfer) are zoned thicker and with higher quality refractory
than other parts of the vessel.
For more analysis of stainless steelmaking refractories, see Section 4.4.
12.9.3 Tuyeres and Plugs
The AOD process and most other converter processes have tuyeres mounted in the sidewall or in
the bottom. These tuyeres typically consist of a copper tube with a stainless steel outer tube. An
annulus is formed between the copper and stainless tubes. Cooling gases blown through the outer
annulus (shroud) form a metal or oxide accretion (called a knurdle or a mushroom) at the tuyere
tip. This accretion protects the tuyere and surrounding refractory. Process gases of oxygen/inert
mixtures blow through the inner annulus. Special designs exist for normalizing the flow in the
annular gap.53 Tuyere size and number depend on specific process parameters. There are usually
between two and nine tuyeres in an AOD vessel.
Sidewall mounted tuyeres are submerged while processing. When the vessel is rotated, the tuyeres
are above the bath. At this point, the process gases can be shut off and a small cooling flow pro-
tects the tuyeres.
Bottom-blown vessels have a variety of tuyere configurations depending on flow rates required.
There are usually two to four tuyeres in the bottom. Most have some variation of OBM (Q-BOP)
tuyeres. Processes with low flow rates that use only inert gases, such as VOD, for the bottom-blown
gases can use a plug instead of a tuyere.
12.9.4 Top Lances
A lance, while not required, greatly improves converter processes. In the high carbon region, a lance
can increase the oxygen input rate, increasing the decarburization rate. A lance can be used for post-
combustion of carbon monoxide, increasing the scrap melting rate or temperature of the bath. For
small vessels, post-combustion lowers fueling requirements and increases process efficiency.

733

The amount of oxygen that reacts with the bath can range from 30 to 100% of the oxygen blown.
This amount depends on lance height, nozzle design and gas pressure used.
There are two basic lance types, sonic/subsonic and supersonic. Sonic/subsonic lances consist of
straight pipes, while supersonic lances use converging/diverging (Laval) nozzles. Supersonic
lances are always water cooled. Sonic/subsonic lances might be water cooled depending on lance
operating position. Smaller sonic/subsonic lances often are not water cooled. Many sonic/subsonic
lances are simple pipes with nickel or calorized tips to increase heat resistance.
A water-cooled lance is typically positioned one to four metres from the bath surface. Non-water-
cooled lances are positioned close to the vessel mouth.
Supersonic lances are used for high oxygen input rates where post-combustion is not required. A
great majority of the oxygen from a supersonic lance will react with the bath.54 As in BOF opera-
tion, the lance can have post-combustion ports.
With sonic lances, some of the oxygen will not react with the bath; some post-combustion is
inevitable.55 Heat balances indicate that 75 to 90% of available energy from post-combustion is
transferred to the molten bath. The simplicity of a non-water-cooled sonic lance makes it attractive
to smaller shops.
Inert gases are sometimes injected with the oxygen from the top lance to extend the period the top-
blown gases are used. Argon top blowing can reduce air infiltration into the vessel and improve car-
bon removal efficiency in the late stages of the decarburization blow. This is especially true for vessels
where high rate bottom argon blowing causes excessive splashing, vibration, or refractory wear.
A recent development in top lance technology is the development of top heating. An oxy-fuel
burner in the top of the vessel provides heat to the vessel during operation.56 This results in bene-
fits similar to post-combustion.
12.9.5 Gases
Pure argon, oxygen, and nitrogen are used by virtually all shops. In rare cases, nitrogen is not used
because the product mix or operation pattern does not warrant the extra cost of supplying nitrogen.
Some other gases used are crude argon, high-pressure air, non-cryogenic nitrogen and oxygen,
hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide. These other gas choices depend on operational pattern, relative
cost of supply and product mix.
Crude argon contains 95–97% argon, 1–3% oxygen, and 0.5–2% nitrogen. It can be used in the
middle to late stages of decarburization and reduction, depending on final product specifications.
The choice of using crude argon is dependent on availability, relative cost to pure argon, and prod-
uct specifications.
High-pressure air can be used to partially replace nitrogen, but the capital and maintenance cost of
compressors and associated equipment limit this option to larger melt shops. Non-cryogenic nitro-
gen and oxygen sources also require some compression for use in refining processes, and the
choice of this supply method again depends on pure versus non-cryogenic prices, duty cycle, power
costs and production rates compared to pure gases.57
Carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons can be used as process gases down to certain carbon levels. In
stainless production, increased chromium oxidation below 0.3%C by carbon dioxide58or hydrogen
and carbon pickup from hydrocarbons limits the use of these gases. The replacement of nitrogen
by these gases depends on the relative cost of the gases. Low nitrogen specification grades of stain-
less steel, which typically are made using only argon as an inert gas, can use carbon dioxide as a
replacement for argon in the early stages of decarburization.
12.9.6 Vessel Drive System
The drive system is similar to a BOF converter except that in most cases the vessel is removable
from the trunnion. Torque requirements and safety interlocks are an important design criteria.
Steelmaking and Refining Volume
734

Some vessels are designed to rotate 360°. Side-blown vessels generally have replaceable shells.
With removable vessels, crane access and capacity are considerations in the placement and size of
the operating unit.
The trunnion bearings and drive must be designed to handle the vibration and rocking motion of
the converter during processing.
12.9.7 Emissions Collection
Emissions collection strategies fall into two categories. Close capture hoods have a small gap, typ-
ically 0.2 to 0.4 metres, between the hood and vessel mouth. They are usually water cooled because
the hot gases cannot entrain enough dilution air to cool the gas. Alloy addition chutes and lance
positioning for alloy additions must be integrated with the hood. Other types of capture hoods are
further from the vessel mouth. These are usually refractory lined and not water cooled.
Canopy systems have a substantial distance from the vessel mouth to the collection duct that is
located in the roof of the shop. An accelerator stack is sometimes used as a chimney to direct the
smoke plume to the collection duct.
Baghouse fan capacity, crane location, emissions regulations and cost dictate the choice of emis-
sion collection system. Several systems use wet or dry precipitators in place of bags for dust col-
lection. Top lance placement can hamper optimal placement of the collection hood. The lance will
have to penetrate the collection hood at some point. Close capture systems require less baghouse
capacity and are likely to emit less smoke, but water cooling duct work can be expensive.
Canopy systems will not operate effectively if the crane must pass through the plume periodically.
Baghouse requirements are usually higher because the baghouse must also take in dilution air that is
entrained into the rising smoke plume. On the plus side, water cooling of the canopy is usually not
necessary. However, placement of a lance with an accelerator stack system can be problematical.
The gas evolved from the converter is primarily CO along with argon or nitrogen, unless substan-
tial post-combustion occurs. A major portion of the combustion and cooling takes place at the
mouth exit and/or at the hood intake. Further cooling takes place in the duct. By the time the gas
reaches the baghouse, the gas temperature is typically 120°C. The gas is composed primarily of
CO2 and inert gas. Solids emissions from the converter are primarily particulates of metallic (e.g.,
iron, chromium and manganese) and non-metallic oxides (e.g., lime and silica). Total solids emis-
sions average between 6 to 10 kg/ton of metal. Dust loading is about 50 grams/cubic metre. In the
United States, baghouse dust is normally handled by commercial processors.
For a new installation, the total cost of the fume system is typically about 40% of the total con-
verter installation cost. In vacuum processes, the fume collection system is an integral part of the
equipment and typically is used in conjunction with a water treatment plant.
12.10 Vessel Operation
No matter what converter-based process is used for refining stainless steel, there are several com-
mon steps during the refining process. Decarburization is the carbon removal step. As decarbur-
ization is not completely efficient, some metallic oxides are formed. Reduction recovers these
oxides from the slag phase. Refining of the metal occurs throughout processing. Each of these
steps will be described in more detail.
12.10.1 Decarburization
After the molten charge is in the vessel, an oxygen-inert gas (argon, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide)
mixture is injected into the vessel. The initial oxygen to inert ratio generally varies in the range
of 5:1 to 3:1 and is lowered with the progress of decarburization. The major benefit associated
with the dilution process comes into play when the oxygen to inert gas ratio is 1:1 and then fur-

735

ther reduced to 1:3 or lower. Oxidation of carbon continues, but oxidation of chromium is limited.
The latter is due to the very low oxygen potential of the gas mixture, which minimizes chromium
oxidation.
For a 300 series stainless, a typical stepped blow would be 1.5 Nm3/min/ton oxygen mixed with
0.5 Nm3/min/ton inert gas from the start carbon content to 0.35%C, then 0.5 Nm3/min/ton oxygen
mixed with 0.5 Nm3/min/ton inert gas to 0.15%C, followed by 0.25 Nm3/min/ton oxygen mixed
with 0.75 Nm3/min/ton inert gas to 0.05%C; and then 100% argon to final specification.
More recent blow programs consist of using a starting oxygen to inert gas ratio of higher than 3:1
and continuous adjustment of the oxygen to inert gas ratio during the blowing period. Depending
on the aim nitrogen content, nitrogen can be used as the inert gas for a period of the oxygen blow.
Beginning carbon levels in converter processing may range from 0.7–4.5%C, with a typical range
of 1.0–2.5%. Typical silicon levels range 0.2–0.4% before decarburization.
If a top lance is available, it is used during the high oxygen to inert gas periods. Some vessels use
a top lance to add heat. The top heating lance is a modified oxy-fuel burner.
During decarburization, additions are made for obtaining the proper final chemical composition.
These additions usually consist of desired amounts of high carbon ferrochromium, stainless steel
scrap, carbon steel scrap, nickel, iron, high carbon ferromanganese, and molybdenum oxide. These
additions serve to reduce the bath temperature as carbon and chromium oxidation are exothermic.
In general, the bath temperature is controlled to less than 1720°C. Total alloy addition weights are
in the range of 5–30% of tap weight.
Lime or dolomitic limes are usually added just before the oxygen blow to flux the transfer slag and
silicon in the metal. During the oxygen blow, silicon is oxidized before carbon. Lime and dolomitic
lime are sometimes added before the end of the blow to cool the bath and to reduce the volume of
reduction additions. Slag fluxing additions, such as lime, dolomitic lime and spar, are typically in
the range of 3–7% total bath weight.
It follows that the length of the blow period is determined by the starting carbon and silicon levels
of the hot metal charged to the AOD. Decarburization times range from 20 to 35 minutes in mod-
ern converters (start carbon 1.5 to 2.5% and aim carbon 0.04%). Usually, the vessel is turned down
to a horizontal position and a sample of the melt is taken for analyses at a carbon level of about
0.1%. Some high productivity shops can sample without rotating the vessel by using a sub-lance.
The steel sample is analyzed for carbon. The temperature of the steel bath is also measured.
The next step is the reduction step, in which the reduction additions are charged and stirred with
an inert gas for a desired time. The reduction mix consists of silicon alloys, such as ferrosilicon or
chromium-silicon, and/or aluminum, which are added for the reduction of metallic oxides from the
slag and fluxing agents such as limestone, lime, dolomitic lime, and fluorspar. The bath is then
stirred with inert gas, typically for only for five to eight minutes. An example of a reduction mix
is given in Chapter 2, Section 2.9.3.
The formation of a high basicity slag and the reduction of oxygen potential in the metal bath are
good conditions for sulfur removal. For example, with a start sulfur of 0.03%, a reduction treat-
ment of 2–3 kg aluminum/ton, 2–3 kg spar/ton, final slag basicity of about 1.7, and temperature of
1700°C, finish sulfur contents of 0.003–0.005% can be obtained.
If the grade to be produced requires an extra low sulfur level, the bath is deslagged after the reduc-
tion step and another basic slag is added. The liquid steel and the fluxes are then mixed to com-
plete the desulfurization reaction. In modern practices a sulfur level of 0.001% or less is easily
achieved with this double slag practice.
Ideally, at this stage of the process, the chemistry of the liquid steel should meet final specifica-
tions so that the heat can be tapped. If necessary, additional raw materials may need to be charged
for small chemistry adjustments. Depending on the grade, additional deoxidation or alloying addi-
tions maybe needed. Such final additions are stirred in the AOD just before tap or are added in
the tap ladle.

Following tap, the ladle is often stirred for composition homogenization and temperature unifor-
mity along with flotation of inclusions. This is done in a ladle equipped with stirring facilities with
or without the use of a ladle furnace. After the ladle treatment, the steel is ready to be cast.
12.10.2 Refining
The amount of stirring energy from the gas blown through the subsurface tuyeres and the forma-
tion of carbon monoxide deep within the metal bath results in the converter processes being among
the most intensely stirred metallurgical reactors. The intimate gas–metal contact and excellent
slag–metal mixing facilitate refining reactions.
Sulfur removal is a slag–metal reaction that occurs during the reduction phase of the process.
Phosphorus, which requires oxidizing conditions, cannot be removed in the converter processing.
Nitrogen control is a gas–metal reaction. Depending on final nitrogen specifications for the stain-
less grade, the inert gas during the initial stages of decarburization can be nitrogen. After a certain
carbon level is achieved, the nitrogen gas is replaced by argon. Such an approach is practiced by
all steelmakers to reduce argon usage and costs and still achieve a desired nitrogen specification.
After the change from nitrogen to argon, nitrogen is removed from the bath by both evolved car-
bon monoxide and argon.59,60 Volatile elements with high vapor pressures, such as lead, zinc, and
bismuth, are removed during the decarburization period.61
12.10.3 Process Control
The nature and number of reactions makes mathematical modeling and process control of stainless
steel refining more complicated than standard pneumatic steelmaking.
Static calculation (i.e. no feedback) methods were used in the early days of stainless processing.
These calculations were standardized on worksheets that allowed operators to estimate temperature
changes, oxygen to inert gas ratio changes and nitrogen to argon changes. Reduction materials cal-
culations were also performed. 
With the introduction of powerful and inexpensive computers, dynamic calculations with automated
or manual correction can be employed. These allow the incorporation of sophisticated models for
temperature, blow program, nitrogen, and alloy addition control. Coupled with automated additions
systems, process variability has been much reduced and process efficiency has steadily improved.
Process control computer models (static, dynamic or hybrid) may utilize artificial intelligence to
control endpoint carbon and temperature levels and may eventually eliminate the need for sub-
lances and/or offgas analyses. At a minimum, these programs advise the operator of blowing proce-
dures, alloy and flux addition requirements and nitrogen switch-points, as well as provide data
logging. Many operators integrate the process control computer model with the gas control system
(valve rack) and some with other vessel functions (vessel rotation, additions, and fume system inter-
faces, sampling, etc.). These programs can be integrated with automated sampling equipment and/or
equipment for offgas analyses. The degree of control and process algorithm sophistication varies.
12.10.4 Post-Vessel Treatments
Post-converter vessel treatments after converter processing are similar to treatments for other steel
grades. Post-treatment facilities have several benefits: reduced converter tap-to-tap time, improved
quality, and an inventory buffer of metal between the converter and the continuous caster. The use
of ladle metallurgy furnaces for post-vessel treatments is increasing, especially in shops with con-
tinuous casting facilities.
Ladle treatment stations normally include an automated additions system, an injection lance or
porous plug for stirring with inert gas, and wire feeding equipment. Some producers use lances
to inject lime, fluorspar, and calcium alloys for quality improvements such as reduced inclusion

content, inclusion shape control, improved weldability, and decreased dissolved oxygen levels.
Ladle additions of deoxidizing compounds are common. Wire feeding is used to add alloys of tita-
nium, aluminum, calcium, and sulfur to improve alloy recoveries and quality.
Some operators use ladle furnaces to provide additional heat to perform the above operations.
Carbon pickup from the electrode arcs can be minimized by close control of slag thickness, arc
length and stirring rates, even when treating ultra-low carbon grades.
Shops having vacuum refining units would normally use these for the last stage of decarburization
on ultra-low carbon (ULC) and ultra-low nitrogen (ULN) grades or as part of the triplex (EAF-
Converter-VOD) process.
12.11 Summary
Stainless steels were developed at the beginning of the 20th century. Their unique properties have
led to their use in many different applications. Fundamental research in the thermodynamics and
kinetics led to understanding of the phenomenon associated with chromium oxidation and how to
minimize it. The development of the argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) process revolutionized
stainless steelmaking. This process, based on the dilution principle, allowed steelmakers to use
lower cost raw materials and to shorten the steelmaking times compared to the other processes in
use at that time. This led to lowering the cost of producing stainless steels. This, in turn, led to dra-
matic increases in the applications for stainless steels. Over the years, other processes have been
developed for making stainless steels. Most of these use vessels or reactors in which gases are
introduced to carry out the necessary decarburization reactions. Some of these processes for mak-
ing stainless steels utilize decarburization under vacuum.
Of the many specific processes available for stainless steel refining, argon oxygen decarburization
and its converter-based variants are by far the most commercially popular. For maximum flexibil-
ity to produce a very wide range of stainless steel grades, a modern melt shop may have a source
of molten metal, a converter that can produce most grades economically (duplex processing) and
a vacuum unit for further processing of extra low carbon and nitrogen grades (triplex processing).

13.1 Introduction
Virtually all of the steel in the United States and the world is produced either in an oxygen steel-
making converter such as a BOF, LD, OBM (Q-BOP) etc. or an electric arc furnace (EAF). The
only exception are the few remaining open hearth shops and a negligible amount in other processes
such as the Energy Optimizing Furnace (EOF). This is understandable since much of the steel-
making capacity was built or rebuilt from 1955 to 1975; the BOF and EAF were the best tech-
nologies available at the time and were compatible with large blast furnace production and
relatively inexpensive scrap. However, these conditions are changing. It may be possible to produce
iron economically on a small scale, 0.5 million tons per year, in new processes such as COREX
and bath smelting. Steelmakers desire more flexibility to use scrap and hot metal and other forms
of iron such as direct reduced iron (DRI) and iron carbide. Therefore, it is of value to re-examine
steelmaking options.
There is currently a large amount of development work related to the electric arc furnace includ-
ing scrap preheating, continuous melting and the use of fossil fuels and hot metal. These are dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 10. In particular electric arc furnaces will use more oxygen to oxidize
carbon and for post-combusting CO to CO2. The EAF will act more like a BOF using fossil fuel
such as carbon in iron or in direct reduced (DRI) products. They will also use more virgin (non
scrap) iron such as DRI and liquid hot metal. The alternative steelmaking processes examined in
this chapter are those using no electrical energy.
Many alternative oxygen steelmaking processes were being developed in the 1970s such as IRSID
continuous steelmaking, WORCRA and the Bethlehem continuous process. However, these never
were commercialized, in part because most companies invested in conventional oxygen steelmak-
ing and no new capacity was required. In recent years, other processes have been developed or pro-
posed such as the EOF, the AISI continuous process, iron carbide continuous processes and
IFCON. In this chapter, the general principles of process types are examined, selected steelmaking
processes are technically evaluated and an economic analysis of selected processes is made. This
has been the subject of a 1998 publication and much of this chapter comes from that publication.1
13.2 General Principles and Process Types
The steelmaking processes considered in this chapter can be classified into two general types:
batch and continuous. The continuous processes can be classified as a continuous stirred tank reac-
tor (CSTR) or plug flow reactors (PFR). The process types are shown in Fig. 13.1 along with their
characteristics with regards to concentration and reaction rates.

By performing a simple mass balance in a reactor, one can see that the degree of dispersion in the
system defines the type of reactor where the process takes place. The contributions to backmixing
of fluid flowing in the x direction can be described by the following equation2:
(13.2.1)
where the parameter D is called the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, which characterizes the
degree of backmixing during flow. Equation 13.2.1 can be written in a dimensionless form where
z = (ut + x)/L and Q = t/t = tu/L
(13.2.2)
where the dimensionless group (D/uL) is the inverse of Peclet number, and measures the extent of
longitudinal dispersion. The Peclet number represents the ratio of material transferred by bulk flow
to material transport by Eddy diffusion. L is the length of the reactor and u is the velocity in the
direction of the flow. Therefore,
negligible dispersion, (PFR)
large dispersion, (CSTR)
It means that when the diffusion, plus convection inside the vessel, is small the reactor approaches
an ideal plug flow reactor. On the other hand, when the diffusion and convection are large, the reac-
tor approaches a continuous stirred tank reactor.
Szekely3 has shown that for values of (D/uL) greater than 0.2 there would be extensive dispersion.
He further concluded that furnaces of more than 100 meters in length may be required for minimal
dispersion. Measurements of the (D/uL) from an actual operation of the WORCRA furnace give
value of 0.1 indicating shorter furnaces may be satisfactory4. For plug flow Taylor8 has shown that
the length to width ratio, L/W, should be around 50 for this type of reactor to be a PFR. For highly

stirred steelmaking systems it is difficult to maintain a PFR. The closest such reactor in steelmaking
is a continuous casting tundish. Even for a tundish where turbulence is kept to a minimum it deviates
significantly from a perfect PFR. In some PFR steelmaking processes, such as WORCRA, the slag
runs counter-current to the metal. This has advantages when refining hot metal with high phospho-
rus contents. A further discussion of trough concurrent and counter-current steelmaking is given by
G. Brooks et al5.
The normal oxygen steelmaking processes, the EAF, and the EOF are batch processes. The AISI
and IRSID processes are CSTR while the WORCRA, Bethlehem and the initial Iron Carbide
processes should approach plug flow reactors; these processes are discussed later.
In steelmaking, the primary reaction is decarburization. At high carbon contents the rate is simply
controlled by the oxygen input rate6. Below a critical carbon content, typically about 0.3%C for
normal OSM, the rate is controlled by mass transfer of carbon, is first order with respect to car-
bon, and given by:

where %C and %Ce are the carbon content and the equilibrium content with the slag respectively
and k is the overall decarburization rate constant given by:

(13.2.4)
where

m = mass transfer coefficient
r = density of steel
W = weight of steel
It has been shown that for a CSTR the steady state or tap carbon content, %Ct, is given by7:
(13.2.5)
where, F is the specific feed or production rate which is the production rate divided by the weight
of steel in the vessel and %Co is the initial carbon content.
In attempting to partially convert a reactor with intense stirring into one with concentration differ-
ences like a PFR, barriers are sometimes installed with a small opening for metal flow as shown
schematically in Fig. 13.2. In this case, the tap carbon content is given by:
(13.2.6)
where b is the backmixing flow rate through the opening and %CI is the carbon content of steel in
Reactor I. In this case the W used in computing F is that of Reactor II.
13.3 Specific Alternative Steelmaking Processes
In this section, selected alternative steelmaking processes will be reviewed. A brief description,
current status and an evaluation of the processes is given. The technical evaluation addresses issues
such as productivity, yield and refining capability. First batch processes are discussed followed by
CSTR and PFR. The processes considered are summarized in Table 13.1 with respect to type, typ-
ical charge make-up and current status.

13.3.1 Energy Optimizing Furnace (EOF)
The EOF is essentially a batch oxygen steelmaking process with high post-combustion, with coal
additions and extensive scrap preheating; a schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 13.3.9 The process
theoretically can charge up to 100% scrap, but typically 40–60% scrap is used. Hot metal is
charged into the vessel followed by scrap from the lower preheating chamber. In some cases, a sec-
ond scrap charge is added about five minutes into the blow. The scrap is preheated in a series of
preheat chambers to about 800 to 1200°C. For a 50/50 scrap to hot metal mix about 70 m3/ton of

oxygen, with about one third into the metal and two thirds above the bath for post-combustion, and
about 20 kg/ton of coal is used. The post-combustion gas is used to preheat the scrap and, there-
fore, the energy from post-combustion does not have to be completely transferred to the bath. The
blowing time is about 27–32 minutes and tap-to-tap is less than one hour. Refractory consumption
increases with scrap usage and is approximately 2.5 kg per ton for a 50/50 mix.
An EOF furnace has been operating in Pains Brazil for over 10 years and has produced up to 0.5
mtpy from two 30 ton furnaces. There is an 80 ton furnace at Tata Steel in India and a 60 ton fur-
nace at AFS in Italy. The process has been reasonably well proven using a scrap charge up to 60%.
The productivity of an EOF is similar to that for a state of the art EAF and can produce a 100 ton
heat in an hour. The yield with a 50/50 charge mix is 92–94% which is similar to a BOF. Nitrogen
contents of 30–40 ppm can be achieved and phosphorus levels are similar to a BOF. Residuals
depend on the amount and type of scrap and can be computed from a simple mass balance. Sulfur
can be a significant problem as coal is used in the process. Hot metal desulfurization alone is not
effective because of the high scrap rates and the use of coal. For the following conditions, per ton
of steel, the final sulfur level is 0.07% for a 50/50 mix.

Therefore, significant steel desulfurization is required. If the hot metal is desulfurized to 0.02%,
the final sulfur is 0.033% which is still high for most quality applications.
The EOF is a proven technology which allows for higher scrap melting than a BOF and reasonable
flexibility with respect to the charge mix. With a 400,000 tpa COREX, or bath smelter, an 80 ton
EOF with a 50/50 mix could produce over 750,000 tpa of steel.
Mention should be made of a number of converter based processes which have been developed to
melt more scrap than conventional oxygen steelmaking. The first of these was developed by
Klockner.10 The KMS melted increased amounts of scrap by injecting coal into an OBM (Q-BOP)
converter while the KS process could melt 100% scrap using a liquid metal heel. Nippon Steel11
and Kawasaki Steel12 investigated similar types of processes. The Tula or Z-BOP process which
originated in Russia and used by ISCOR at its Newcastle plant and tested by Bethlehem Steel, uses
lump coal in a conventional top blown BOF to melt up to 100% scrap.13 When melting large
amounts of scrap there was excessive iron oxidation. However, none of these processes continued
on a commercial basis and do not appear as efficient as the EOF which maximizes post-combus-
tion and uses scrap preheating.
13.3.2 AISI Continuous Refining
As part of the AISI-DOE direct steelmaking project a continuous steelmaking process was evalu-
ated and a limited number of pilot scale tests were run. The process is described and evaluated in
detail by Abel et al7. A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 13.4. Hot metal and possibly scrap
along with the required fluxes are added continuously to the top of the converter, oxygen is blown
through the bottom using OBM (Q-BOP) type tuyeres and tapped continuously.
The AISI converter is essentially a CSTR and equation 13.2.5 can be used to relate the final carbon
to the production rate. For example, for a 100 ton reactor processing 80% hot metal and 20% scrap
producing 0.05%C could produce about 100 ton per hour. A value of 60 hr–1 (1.0 min.–1) was used
for k which is typical for bottom blowing processes. However, as discussed in detail elsewhere7 since
decarburization is carried out at low carbon contents a large percentage of the oxygen oxidizes iron
resulting in large yield losses (>25%). For this reason, the process development was terminated.

As part of the AISI project a two zone smelter was investigated both in the pilot plant and theoret-
ically. The basic concept is similar to that shown in Fig. 13.2. The concept is to reduce the carbon
content in Reactor I to approximately 1% followed by final decarburization in Reactor II with the
excess FeO in the slag flowing to Reactor I where it is reduced. A critical concern is the size of the
opening in the barrier to avoid excessive back mixing. As an example, consider a 300 t/hr furnace
consisting of two 100 ton CSTR separated by the barrier and the carbon content is reduced to 1%
in Reactor I. To produce steel with 0.05% C, backmixing according to equation 13.2.6 must be lim-
ited to 20 t/hr (b = 0.2) Pilot plant work and water modeling by Zhang et al(14) indicates the area
of the opening must be limited to about 0.1 m2 or for a square opening 31.6 cm on a side. To main-
tain the barrier with such a small opening would be extremely difficult to do in practice.
Another problem is that there is excessive iron oxidation in Reactor II. In theory it is reduced in
Reactor I supplying 75% of the oxygen required for decarburization. The reduction reaction 13.3.1
is endothermic and with the reduced oxygen gas requirement slag-metal mixing may be insuffi-
cient for rapid refining.
(FeO) + C = CO + Fe
(13.3.1)
Reactor I would be operating more like an open hearth type furnace. Based on the anticipated prob-
lems with the barrier, control and the nature of the reactions in Reactor I work on the development
of this process was also terminated.
13.3.3 IRSID Continuous Steelmaking
Of the existing continuous steelmaking processes the IRSID process was the most extensively
developed and is one of the most promising15. The process was tested on a 10–12 , ton per hour
scale at IRSID at Maizieres-Les-Metz and up to 25 tons per hour at Hagondange. A schematic dia-
gram of the process is shown in Fig. 13.5. The process is described elsewhere in detail.15 Briefly,
liquid hot metal is poured into the reactor at a controlled rate and an oxygen jet impinges onto the
stream forming an emulsion of gas, slag and metal. The emulsion overflows into a decanter in
which slag-metal separation takes place.

In normal batch oxygen steelmaking, such as the BOF, the oxygen jet and reaction gases cause an
extensive slag-metal emulsion with about 30–35% of the metal in the emulsion. The rate of decarbur-
ization at high carbon levels is limited simply by oxygen blowing rates. Below some critical carbon
content, about 0.3%, the rate is limited by liquid phase mass transfer of carbon in the metal. The
rate of mass transfer is first order with respect to carbon content. The metal drops in the emulsion
are decarburized to some extent and then enter the liquid metal pool in the bottom of the furnace.
The average carbon content of the metal drops is slightly less than in the bulk metal and, therefore,
the rate of decarburization can be related to the bulk metal concentration. The production rate for
a given furnace is limited by the rate of gas removal. That is, there is a free volume requirement
for a given rate of gas generation.
The reaction mechanism for the IRSID process is not known. As the metal enters the reactor it is
hit with an oxygen jet causing nearly all of the metal to be emulsified. Observations indicate there
is no liquid metal pool. In this case the metal drops remain in the emulsion during their entire
retention time in the reactor. The rate depends on how long the drops are in the reactor since their
carbon content is changing in time. The metal which overflows into the decanter is the average car-
bon content of the metal in the reactor. The retention time of the metal drops in the reactor depends
on the reactor size.
Obviously the IRSID process is more complex than a normal BOF and no model exists for the
process. In order to extrapolate the results obtained by IRSID and evaluate the process a reason-
able model is essential. The assumptions for the present model are given below:
1. The rate of decarburization of the metal drop is controlled by liquid phase mass
transfer of carbon.
2. There is always sufficient oxygen present as oxygen gas or FeO in the slag.
3. The metal drops react independently and do not combine.
4. It is recognized that there is a distribution of metal drops in the emulsion that are
decarburized at different rates due to differing area to volume ratios. However, it is
assumed that the average rate of decarburization for the weighted average size
droplets adequately describes the system. The Sauter diameter d32 should be used in
such an analysis.
(13.3.2)
5. The carbon content of the metal leaving the reactor is the average of all the drops in
the emulsion.
6. There is sufficient slag to hold all of the metal in the emulsion.
The rate of decarburization of a single droplet is controlled by mass transfer and the carbon con-
tent is given by:
(13.3.3)
where,
CD = carbon content of a drop after time t
Co is the initial carbon content

AD = area of drop
m = mass transfer coefficient
r = density of the metal
WD = weight of the drop
The reactor is not plug flow but rather a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). That is, some of
the particles only react for a short time and may have a high carbon content while others are very
low in carbon. For a CSTR the residence time distribution f(t) is given by:
(13.3.5)
where f(t) is the fraction of drops in the bath for time t and tr is the average residence time. The
average or final carbon content of the metal leaving the reactor is given by:
(13.3.6)
(13.3.7)
(13.3.8)
Equation 13.3.8 is a very simple but useful expression for evaluating the IRSID process. It is inter-
esting to note that the rate of decarburization is reasonably fast and most of the drops are fully
decarburized. The carbon in the final metal results primarily from the drops which only spend a
short time in the reactor.
For typical oxygen blowing rates and slag volumes in a BOF the value of k is about 0.017 s–1. In
comparison to the BOF in the IRSID process all of the metal is in the emulsion. This causes the
reaction area (A) to increase correspondingly. With all the metal rather than 30% in the emulsion
the value of k is estimated to be a factor of about 3.3 higher or about 0.55 s–1.
It is also necessary to estimate the retention time (tr). It has been found that there is a required
reactor volume to hold the slag metal emulsion in a BOF which depends on the rate of CO for-
mation. The reactor volume at any time is filled with slag, metal and gas. In a normal BOF, 70%
of the emulsion is gas. In the IRSID process, it may be even higher due to the faster rate of gas
generation. If the gas occupies 70% of the volume, the retention time of the metal and slag is
given by:
(13.3.9)
where,
VR = reactor volume
V.
s = volume flow rate of slag
V.
m = volume flow rate of metal
For example, consider a 10 m3 reactor producing 100 t/hr of steel and 75 kg of slag per ton, the
retention time is about 10.75 minutes (645 s). Using equation 13.3.7, and 0.055 s–1 for k and an
average initial carbon of the scrap plus metal of 4%, the predicted final carbon content is about
0.1%. It should be noted that this is only a crude estimate. However, it does agree with the pilot
plant results at IRSID in which in a smaller scale unit the final carbon content was about 0.08%.
The productivity of the IRSID process obviously depends on the reactor size but 200 t per hour
should be easily achieved. The yield and refining for sulfur phosphorus, etc., should be similar to

a BOF. Scrap can be melted but must be added continuously and sized so it melts rapidly. Metal
feeding rate is critical in order to match the oxygen input. IRSID used a fairly crude but effective
metal feeding system over 20 years ago. With the advent of slide gates and other metal flow con-
trol devices adequate metal flow control should be possible. Due to the high gas generation rate
there could be a large amount of dust generation. However, some of the dust should settle out in
the decanter. Refractory wear in the reactor may be a concern due to the violent reactions for the
emulsion overflow. Refractory consumption is expected to be significantly higher than for a BOF
with slag splashing.
13.3.4 Trough Process
From about 1970 to 1983 a number of continuous steelmaking processes were suggested or tested
on a pilot scale in which a long trough was used in which liquid hot metal was added to one end,
a series of oxygen lances or tuyeres, placed longitudinal, were used for decarburization and the
metal was tapped on the other end. The slag in some cases flows counter current to the metal. The
processes which were tested on a pilot scale included the Bethlehem process16, the NRIM (Japan)
process17, the WORCRA process18 and the COSMOS (U.S.Steel) process19. These processes all
reached the pilot scale at production rates generally of about 5 to 12 tons per hour.
The processes were all somewhat similar and a schematic of the WORCRA process is shown in
Fig. 13.6. The NRIM used a series of trough furnaces with desiliconization and partial dephos-
phorization carried out in the first reactor, decarburization and final dephosphorization in the sec-
ond and grading and alloying in the third reactor. The slag from each furnace is removed separately.
COSMOS used bottom OBM (Q-BOP) tuyeres instead of lances.
As noted earlier, to avoid backmixing the length to width ratio (L/W) should be around 50. None
of the pilot facilities had this ratio and, therefore, did not act as a perfect PFR, but had significant
backmixing. Even with modest values (L/W) there was excessive heat losses due to the large sur-
face to volume ratio and relatively low production rates. Calculations indicate that even at reason-
able production rates the heat losses for these processes would be significantly higher than for
other processes.

Other problems associated with these processes include metal feed control, the necessity to size
scrap and other coolants, lower phosphorus removal due to inadequate slag metal mixing and the
difficulty in producing low carbon steels (<0.06%).
It should be noted that these type processes had some success in nonferrous metallurgy. Noranda20
developed a process for copper using a 21 m long reactor with 16 tuyeres. An analysis of the process
indicates that the reactor worked as 6–7 CSTR reactors in series and was approaching a PFR. The
QSL process21 for lead has also been commercialized. These processes operate at lower tempera-
tures than for steelmaking and, therefore, the high heat losses and refractory with this geometry is
less critical. Also, the production rate is low compared to that required for steelmaking.
13.3.5 Other Steelmaking Alternatives
Several other alternative steelmaking processes have been proposed or reached a pilot stage. Two
iron carbide continuous steelmaking processes have been proposed. In the original conceptual
process, iron carbide is refined in a trough type reactor with extensive post-combustion supplying
much of the energy22. This process has not been tested on any scale. It would suffer from all of the
drawbacks of the other trough processes and the need for very high degrees of post-combustion
which have not been achieved in any other process. A second process based on iron carbide, “Car-
bide to Steel” has been proposed by G. Geiger23 in conjunction with U.S.Steel. They concluded that
the original concept of a QSL type trough reactor would not be feasible because the CO evolution,
from the unreacted FeO in the carbide and from decarburization, would be so great it would be
impossible to maintain a carbon concentration gradient. They concluded it was more attractive to
divide the process into two stages shown schematically in Fig. 13.7. In the first vessel, the Fe3C
would be injected and melted with carbon oxidation providing part of the energy. In the first reac-
tor, the carbon content is reduced to about 2% and then tapped into a second reactor which is a
trough reactor in which final decarburization takes place. The CO from the second reactor is trans-
ferred to the first and along with the CO from the first reactor is post-combusted to CO2 to pro-
vide most of the energy for reduction of the remaining FeO in the carbide and melting. They

concluded that in order to avoid excessive heat losses the smallest feasible plant would be 45
tons/hour. They invited Nucor to help design such a plant. Whereas the process is theoretically
attractive, it is only a concept and to date (1998) no steel has been produced. It requires higher lev-
els of post-combustion than have even been achieved in other processes and the availability of iron
carbide at a reasonable cost. If such a process was possible it could be used for other feeds such as
HBI or DRI plus carbon, granulated pig iron or liquid hot metal and DRI or HBI.
Another extremely interesting, and possibly revolutionary process, is the IFCON process under
development by ISCOR in South Africa. Little public information is available except for its patent.24
A schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 13.8. The process utilizes a channel type induction furnace
similar to that used in hot metal mixers. According to the patent, the process can use hot metal and
partially reduced sponge iron (direct reduced iron), sponge iron only and, even more interestingly,
iron ore and coal to produce steel directly. The latter version of the process would be truly revolu-
tionary and satisfy the long time dream of steelmakers to go from ore to steel in a single reactor.
According to the ISCOR patent24, when using ore, the ore and coal are added to the furnace con-
tinuously. Oxygen is added primarily for post-combustion of the CO from reduction and hydrogen
from the coal. Post-combustion supplies a significant amount of energy for reduction. Electrical
energy is supplied by the channel inductors for melting the reduced iron. ISCOR has operated a
pilot plant and is considering a commercial/demonstration plant. No operating information from the
pilot plant is available. However, a small pilot plant has been in operation at Pretoria and has run
continuously for several campaigns of over one month each and produced steel with 0.03–0.1%C.
A semi-commercial plant producing approximately 300,000 tpy is scheduled to begin operation in
1998 in South Africa. If such a process proves feasible it could drastically reduce the capital cost
associated with steelmaking by eliminating the coke and sinter plants and combining iron and steel-
making in one vessel.

13.4 Economic Evaluation
For a new process to be commercialized it not only must be technically feasible, it must have a clear
economic or strategic advantage over existing proven processes. Also, when comparing processes
using different input materials it is the only way a meaningful comparison can be made. All eco-
nomic evaluations for steelmaking processes are site specific. Furthermore, other considerations
beyond cost alone, such as the availability of coke, hot metal and electricity and the type or qual-
ity of steel for the market application are important. Nevertheless, an economic evaluation is valu-
able as long as the assumption and unit costs used are reasonable.
The processes which appear to be the most promising are the EOF and the IRSID continuous
process. All of the other processes considered have significant technical drawbacks. These two
processes are compared to a BOF and an EAF.
A major concern is capital costs which are also site specific and certain assumptions must be made.
The assumptions in the present case are:
1. Annual production of 800,000–1,000,000 tons.
2. The building exists.
3. Hot metal and steel ladles and cranes exist.
4. Oxygen and other utilities are at the battery boundary.
It is beyond the expertise of the authors to make accurate capital cost estimates. The capital costs for
the various processes given in Table 13.2 were made by experts for the American Iron and Steel Insti-
tute (AISI)1. There is a relatively large range of capital cost for the EOF and IRSID processes because
there is greater uncertainty since few or no units have been built. Whereas actual capital costs are very
site specific the values given in Table 13.2 are for a similar site. Therefore, whereas the actual capi-
tal costs may be significantly different, the relative cost for the processes should be reasonable.

(1)When using large quantities of hot metal the capital cost for the EAF will be about 10% higher due to the oxygen lances and gas
cleaning system.
Estimated cost of production was made for several cases. Production costs are sensitive to the unit
cost of the inputs including scrap, hot metal, labor, etc. The unit costs will be a function of plant
location and time and therefore can vary greatly. The analysis used was for the United States in
1998. However, as will be demonstrated, the major variables are the cost of scrap versus hot metal
and the cost of capital.
For the BOF and IRSID processes, which use primarily hot metal, the charge was assumed to be
80% hot metal and 20% scrap. The EOF is for 50% scrap and 50% hot metal. The EAF estimates
are for scrap plus 50% DRI/HBI or 50% hot metal. These charge balances are for the production
of medium to high quality flat rolled which would be a likely product for a new plant. Materials
consumption for the BOF was a typical state of the art process. For the EAF, the HBI/DRI was
assumed to be 92% total iron at 92% metallization, 2% gangue, and 2% carbon. The energy and
materials consumptions were calculated from a comprehensive energy and materials model for the
EAF. The EOF materials consumption were from an operating furnace which were verified with an
energy and materials balance. The desulfurization cost for the EOF are high because of the use of

coal or coke for energy to melt the scrap. The BOF refractory costs are lower due to slag splash-
ing which extends refractory life. Other costs include dust handling and electrodes which are
higher for an EAF. The BOF and IRSID processes have slightly higher labor costs due to the charg-
ing and tapping operations. The capital costs were computed assuming 8% depreciation and 8%
return on investment or a total of 16% of the figures given in Table 13.2.
The most sensitive input is the cost of scrap. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is done for the cost
and amount of scrap. In the past decade the price of scrap has varied by more than 50%. The price
of scrap given in Table 13.3 is the weighted average price of a typical charge mix for higher value
products. A sensitivity analysis was performed in which the price of scrap varied from $100 to
$160 per ton. The results are given in Fig. 13.9. As expected, the scrap based processes (EAF and
EOF) costs decrease with decreasing scrap prices and at $100 per ton of scrap their costs are equal
or less than those using less scrap.
The other major uncertainty is the cost of hot metal. Obviously an increase in hot metal costs will
adversely affect the economics of those processes using hot metal and its effect can be easily esti-
mated. Therefore, comparisons of processes which use differing amounts of hot metal and scrap
should be made only if precise information on the cost of the charge materials are known.
The IRSID process has lower capital cost. A BOF is actually only making steel about half the time
due to the time required for charging and tapping whereas the IRSID process is continuous and,
therefore, has a higher productivity to volume ratio. Also, the IRSID process requires less capital
because it has a permanent oxygen lance and does not require vessel rotation equipment. In the late
1970s, The United Nations25 examined continuous steelmaking processes studied up to that time.
They also concluded that the IRSID process was the most attractive alternative and potentially had
significantly lower capital cost than a conventional BOF.
The EOF has lower capital cost than the EAF because it does not require a transformer, electrode
mechanism, etc. It has a lower operating cost because of lower energy costs. However, it does
require a source of hot metal which is currently unavailable economically from a blast furnace. It
would require a COREX or new smelting ironmaking process which can produce iron economi-
cally at low production rates. The EAF could use hot metal reducing its energy cost.  However, hot
metal is more costly and not usually available for an EAF. In comparing an EOF and EAF with
50% hot metal, the EOF cost may be lower because of lower capital but the EOF is less flexible.

13.5 Summary and Conclusions
Economic and strategic considerations with regards to steelmaking have changed in the past decade
and will continue to change significantly. When one is considering steelmaking processes the EAF
and the BOF may not necessarily be the only options. In particular the EAF will use more oxygen and
virgin iron and resemble a hybrid process between the EAF and the BOF as discussed in Chapter 10.

In this chapter a technical evaluation of proposed and operating alternatives to a purely oxygen steel-
making process was conducted. The evaluation indicated that the IRSID continuous steelmaking
process may be an attractive alternative to a traditional BOF and the EOF could be an attractive option
when high scrap charge levels (50%) are required. The other processes considered, including the AISI
continuous process and the various trough processes, have significant technical problems.
An economic analysis was performed to compare the costs of the BOF, EAF, IRSID and EOF
processes. Whereas, any economic analysis is site specific and depends on the cost of the various
inputs, in particular scrap, the present analysis indicates that the IRSID and EOF processes are
competitive and may have an advantage over existing processes, the primary advantage being in
lower capital cost. The continuous nature of the IRSID process allows for greater productivity and
the fixed vessel and lance reduces its capital cost. The EOF is capable of melting scrap without the
cost of the electrical energy delivery system of the EAF and results in lower operating energy costs.
However, because of its high degree of development, optimization and capital investment it is
doubtful these will replace existing OSM plants.
In addition to the IRSID and EOF processes other processes under development should also be
considered. In particular, the IFCON process holds much promise as it purports to produce steel
directly from fine raw materials, thereby significantly reducing capital cost. More development
work may be required on the new processes but there is the potential of significant cost savings.

With the publication of the 10th edition of The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel in 1985, the
Association of Iron and Steel Engineers assumed total responsibility for the future of this presti-
gious document from the U.S. Steel Corporation. In 1998, the Association of Iron and Steel
Engineers transferred all rights to The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel to The AISE Steel
Foundation. Readers of the 11th edition will obviously note the most dramatic change in technol-
ogy and style of presentation since the book’s inception in 1919.
In 1995, The AISE Steel Foundation formed an MSTS Steering Committee to oversee the creation
of the 11th edition, and this committee looked out at a vastly different steel industry than that of
the 10th edition. Hence, a new publication concept was deemed necessary, and this concept had to
be consistent with the massive changes in steel industry economics that had occurred during the
1980s and early 1990s. These changes were occasioned by restructuring, downsizing, and whole-
sale implementation of new and improved technology. In turn, these changes produced major
increases in labor productivity, huge reductions in energy consumption, and vastly improved
yields. Concomitant with these improvements, the steel marketplace saw the introduction of a host
of new and improved products.
Given the backdrop of the industry’s transformation, the Steering Committee deemed a revision to
the 10th edition in its current format to be impractical, and therefore decided the 11th edition would
be a series of separate volumes dealing with specific subjects. These initial volumes, along with
their scheduled publication dates, are:
Ironmaking Volume (1999)
Steelmaking and Refining Volume (1998)
Casting Volume (2000)
Flat Products Volume (2001)
Long Products Volume (2002)
The separate volume concept was implemented by selecting Volume Chairpersons who were rec-
ognized as world leaders in their respective fields of technology. These leaders, in turn, recruited
a team of top-notch authors to create the individual chapters. The leaders and expert auhors, many
with backgrounds in the Association of Iron and Steel Engineers and the Iron and Steel Society,
came from individual steel companies, the steel industry supplier base, and several universities
with close associations with the steel industries. Thus, for the first time, the MSTS represents a
broad and diverse view of steel technology as seen from various vantage points within industry
and academe.

Despite all the changes to be found in the 11th edition, the MSTS Steering Committee has held on
to certain traditions. One such tradition has been to provide to a wide audience (or readership)
within the steel industry a basic reference containing the current practices and latest technology
used in the making, shaping, and treating of steel. The primary readership targets are university stu-
dents (technical knowledge), steel producers (training and technology implementation), and cus-
tomers and suppliers (technical orientation and reference). As noted by the author of the 1st edition
in 1919, “the book was written for . . . (those) . . . who are seeking self-instruction.” The 11th edi-
tion attempts to maintain that tradition by incorporating technical information at several different
levels of complexity and detail, thereby offering information of value to a wide-ranging readership.
The Ironmaking Volume and the Steelmaking and Refining Volume, both being published in the
same year, contain common information on physical chemistry and kinetics, refractories, industrial
gases, and fuels and water to make each book self-sufficient. The Ironmaking Volume includes
descriptions of the newly emerging field of alternative iron production, and the Steelmaking and
Refining Volume includes updated information on EAF technology and secondary refining, and
new information on alternatives to conventional steelmaking. The Casting Volume, to be published
in 1999, will include new information on near-net-shape and strip casting, as well as updated infor-
mation on ingot teeming and conventional continuous casting.
The AISE Steel Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement of the iron and steel industry
of North America through training, publications, research, electronic resources and other related
programs of benefit to the industry, receives the benefits of all sales of this publication.
In closing, the MSTS Steering Committee wants to personally thank all of the authors who have
contributed their time and expertise to make the 11th edition a reality.
