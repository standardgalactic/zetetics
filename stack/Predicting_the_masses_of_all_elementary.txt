Note: most of the calculations in this chapter are both independent from and compatible with 
SPD. This is not the case for the prediction of the mass of W- and Z-bosons, shown at the end of 
this chapter, which is predicted using the critical energy of elementary spaces in SPD. 
 
We have seen that gravity is a side-effect of charge and hypercharge. Could the same apply to 
inertia? When we look at the masses of particles, we do notice a rough correlation between the 
mass of a particle and the strength of the associated force. The mesons and the baryons, 
associated with the strong force, are heavier than electrons, which are associated with the 
electromagnetic force. Neutrinos, which are associated with the weak force, do have almost no 
mass at all.  
 
And then we have all the massless particles which happen to be chargeless.  
 
What could be the basis of such a correlation?  
 
Aside from kinetic energy and potential energy, there is another kind of energy that objects have, 
and that is ‘self-energy’. Self-energy is the energy associated with interactions of the field with 
the quantum vacuum. This energy was first conceived by J. J. Thomson in 1881,1 before the 
existence of the quantum vacuum was even known. He associated this energy with the 
interactions that charged objects have with the Aether. The Aether is essentially the pre-quantum 
version of the quantum vacuum.  
 
Electromagnetic mass theory 
 
There are various ways to demonstrate that the mass of the electron is entirely sourced from its 
self-energy. The following approach was introduced to me by the German physicist Klaus Lux 
(personal correspondence; 2018). In his words:  
 
“… For that I assumed the electron to be a small spherical charged object with a field that is 
oriented perpendicular to its surface and that reaches out into all directions and extends to 

infinity, corresponding to the field of a spherical capacitor whose inner sphere is filled with a 
charge and whose outer sphere has an infinite diameter …” 
 
[Disclaimer: The following calculation of the electron mass is the intellectual property of Klaus 
Lux who gave me permission to use it in my book (personal correspondence; 2018). ] 
 
The capacity of a spherical capacitor in a vacuum is given by:  
 
𝐶 = 4 π 𝜀0 𝑟 𝑅
𝑅−𝑟
 
 
With:  
 
𝜀0  = 
1
𝜇0 𝑐2  ≈ 107
4 π 𝑐2  =  8.854 187 817 × 10−12 F · m−1 
 
When 𝑅 → ∞, the capacity is given by:  
 
𝐶 = 107 𝑟
𝑐2  
 
The capacity of a condensator is given by 𝐶= 𝑄𝑈
⁄ , and the energy of a charged condensator by:  
 
𝑊= 1
2  𝐶 𝑈2 
 
Solving 𝐶= 𝑄𝑈
⁄  for 𝑈 yields 𝑈= 𝑄𝐶
⁄  and inserting that into the equation for W yields:  
 
𝑊 = 𝑄2
2 𝐶 
 
Now we insert the equation for 𝐶 and get:  
 
𝑊 = 
𝑄2 𝑐2
2 × 107 𝑟 
 
Inserting the electron charge 𝑒 for 𝑄, the classical electron radius 𝑟e for 𝑟 and dividing through 
𝑐2 yields:  
 
𝑚𝑒 = 
𝑒2
2 × 107 𝑟e
 
 
However, the true value for the electron mass is twice this value and thus given by this simpler 
equation:  
 

𝑚e  = 
𝑒2
107 𝑟e
 
 
Which yields:  
 
𝑚e  = 9.109382913 × 10−31 kg 
 
With the measured value being 9.109383561 × 10−31 kg. As we will see in a moment, the other 
half of the electron’s mass is likely explainable when we account for the movement of the 
electron.  
 
This doesn’t mean we have explained the exact value of the electron mass 𝑚e. This electron 
mass was already used in calculating the classical electron radius 𝑟e, which is given by:  
 
𝑟e  = 
𝑒2
4 π 𝜀0 𝑚e 𝑐2 
 
All we did here was show that we can safely identify the mass of the electron with the self-
energy of the electron.  
 
As already mentioned above, the idea of an electromagnetic explanation for inertial mass goes 
back to J. J. Tomson who first conceived it in 1881.1 Others worked it out in greater detail 
between 1882 and 1904. One of the most engaged among them was Hendrik Lorentz (1892; 
1904).2, 3 They calculated the electromagnetic energy and mass of the electron as:  
 
𝐸e  = 1
2 𝑒2
𝑟e
; 𝑚e  = 2
3 𝑒2
𝑟e 𝑐2 
 
Which implied:  
 
𝑚e  = 4
3 𝐸e
𝑐2 
 
Wilhelm Wien (1900)4 and Max Abraham (1902)5 then concluded that the total mass of bodies is 
identical to their electromagnetic mass.  
 
The 4 3
⁄  factor violates special relativity and over the years there were many physicists showing 
how it disappears in a strictly relativistic treatment of the matter.6, 7, 8 In 2011 Valery Morozov 
showed that a moving charged sphere has a flux of non-electromagnetic energy and this flux has 
an impulse that is exactly 1 3
⁄  of the sphere’s electromagnetic impulse.9, 10  
 
The remaining factor of 1 2
⁄  in Klaus Lux’s calculation can probably be explained in a similar 
way.  
 
For unclear reasons electromagnetic explanations of mass have been rejected in recent decades, 
giving way to the Higgs mechanism. Unlike the above explanations, the Higgs mechanism 

doesn’t provide us with any predictions on the masses of different particles. It is puzzling how 
the energy in the electromagnetic field can be ignored as a source of mass by so many.  
 
If the above considerations are correct, then the inertial mass of a particle is proportional to the 
energy stored in the polarized quantum vacuum around it.  
 
Now that we have seen that mass can be explained by the self-energy of particles, we should test 
this idea further by comparing particle masses with the associated coupling constants.  
 
Naïve approach 
 
We can compare charges associated to different forces by looking at the respective coupling 
constants. If mass is a side effect of charge, then the ratios between coupling constants should be 
equal to the ratios between the different particle masses. The following table lists the first-
generation fermions from the three fundamental forces together with their masses and the 
associated coupling constants:

The neutrino is 7,287,507 times lighter than the electron. This is quite a small mass and fits well 
with the weak charge of the neutrino, but the factors don’t really match: the difference in strength 
of force is merely a factor of 26,646.  
 
The quarks are a bit tricky: the rest mass values presented here are for isolated quarks, which do 
not exist in reality. They correspond to the self-energy of a single quark, which is the energy 
associated with the interactions of that quark with the surrounding quantum vacuum. This 
excludes the interactions the quark has with the other two quarks it normally appears together 
with, or its antiquark partner, in the case of mesons. It also excludes the interactions between 
gluons from different quarks.  
 
In reality, stable quarks are combined in pairs of three, assembled to protons and neutrons. Here 

the proton is 1,836 times heavier and the neutron 1,838 times heavier than an electron. A third of 
that is 612 and 612.6 respectively. This is very roughly close to the difference between the 
strength of the electromagnetic force (represented by the electron) and the strong force 
(represented by the up- and down-quarks), which is also 2 orders of magnitude – at a distance of 
10−15 m it is 137 times stronger than electromagnetism.  
 
For the neutrino, the comparison between charge and (inertial) mass seems to be off by a factor 
of 160, while for the proton it is a much smaller factor of 4.5.  
 
Finding the true coupling constant of the weak force 
 
The coupling constant of the weak force is defined by the squared ratio between the decay time 
of a particle that decays through the weak force and a particle that decays through the strong 
force, namely the Delta-boson ∆+ and the Sigma-boson Σ+ respectively. Strictly speaking it only 
gives us the ratio between the strong force and the weak force, and this ratio is only then truly the 
coupling constant of the weak force if the coupling constant of the strong force can be assumed 
to be ‘1’.  
 
In reality the value ‘1’ for the strong coupling is a simplification that only applies to the outer 
rim of the atomic nucleus. The running of coupling leads to very different values for the strong 
coupling at different energy levels.  
 
The running of coupling for the strong force can be calculated according to:  
 
𝛼S  = 
12 π
(33 −2 𝑛q) ln [𝐸2
𝛬2]
 
 
Here 𝑛q is the number of quarks involved, and since both ∆+ and Σ+ are baryons, and since we 
are looking at decay processes, and not interactions between baryons, we know that 𝑛q = 3. The 
term 𝛬 is determined experimentally and is known to be 𝛬 =  0.2 GeV. It shall also be noted that 
this equation only applies to energies greater than 0.2 GeV.  
 
It is ∆+ which decays through the strong force, and since the weak force is only defined through 
its relation with the strong force as manifesting in the decay of ∆+, we have to calculate the 
strong coupling of ∆+. The mass energy of this particle is 𝐸 =  1,232 MeV, and that leads to a 
strong coupling of:  
 
𝛼S∆ =  0.38 
 
Now we multiply this with the ratio between the strong and the weak coupling, and we obtain:   
 
𝛼W  = 𝛼SΔ  × √
𝜏Δ
𝜏Σ
 
 

𝛼W  =  1.0159543 × 10−7 
 
The true strong-weak coupling ratio 
 
We now have the true coupling constant of the weak force. However, in order to compare the 
ratio between strong and weak coupling with the mass ratio between quarks and neutrinos, we 
have to use the coupling constant associated with quarks for the strong coupling. For quarks, a 
coupling of ‘1’ is just as unrealistic as it is for delta particles.  
 
In proton-proton interactions that are energetic enough to produce Z-bosons, the strong coupling 
is 𝛼S(𝑚Z) =  0.1185 ±  0.0005.11 The weak force has a range of 10−18 m. This coincides with 
the effective size of quarks, which is also 10−18 m. This is a very fortunate coincidence, because 
it allows us to measure 𝛼S directly at the source. It might also turn out that it is not just a 
fortunate coincidence.  
 
The effective coupling for quark interactions is 𝛼S  =  0.1185 ±  0.0005. Using this value for 
the strong force results in a strong-weak coupling ratio of:  
 
𝛼W
𝛼S
 =  1.2039058455 × 10−8 
 
We want to calculate this with the quark-neutrino mass ratio. For doing that we have to use the 
average between the mass of the up- and the down quark, which is:  
 
q𝜇 =  6.4109290 × 10−30 kg 
 
Using this average, the quark-neutrino mass ratio12 turns out to be:  
 
𝑚νe
𝑚q𝜇
 =  1.9497954 × 10−8 
 
The two ratios agree to 62%. Of course, the mass for the electron-neutrino used here, namely 
1.25 × 10−37 kg, or 0.07 eV,12 is only the current best estimate. We can use our charge mass 
theory to predict a mass for the electron-neutrino. This yields:  
 
𝛼W
𝛼S
 = 
𝑚νe
𝑚q𝜇
 
 
𝑚νe  = 
𝛼W 𝑚q𝜇
𝛼S
 
 
𝑚νe  =  7.718 × 10−38 kg 
 
Measurements indicate that the upper limit for the effective mass of the neutrino is:12, 13, 14  
 

𝑚ν  <  1.78 × 10−36 kg =  0.8 eV 
 
And that the lower limit is:14 
 
𝑚ν  >  3.5653238 × 10−38 kg =  0.02 eV 
 
However, our above prediction is about the electron-neutrino specifically, and so we have to look 
at the upper and lower bound for the mass of electron-neutrinos. Beta-decay experiments 
published in 2022 have given an upper bound for the electron-neutrino, which is:13 
 
𝑚νe  <  1.25 × 10−36 kg =  0.7 eV 
 
And the lower bound is:15 
 
𝑚ν  >  1.7826619 × 10−38 kg =  0.01 eV 
 
The above predicted mass is correct within the margins of error:  
 
1.783 × 10−38 kg <  7.718 × 10−38 kg <  1.4 × 10−36 kg 
 
Quark-electron ratio and electro-strong ratio 
 
The electron is 6.65 times heaver than the average between the up- and down-quark mass:  
 
3.4 eV 0.510998950 eV
⁄
 =  6.65 
 
When we account for margins of error, then the average mass is:  
 
𝑚q𝜇= 3.45 ± 0.5 eV 
 
That means the quarks are 6.75 ±  0.98 times heavier than the electron.  
 
When using 𝛼S(𝑚Z) for the coupling constant of the strong force, then the strong force is about 
16 times stronger than the electromagnetic force:  
 
0.1185 0.00729927
⁄
 =  16.23 
 
Using the mean values, that is a 41% agreement. Using the marginal values, we get 36 –  48% 
agreement. For a more accurate prediction we might have to account for other types of self-
energy, stemming from the potential to decay, as is the case when quarks form neutrons, or the 
potential to form various mesons and baryons, which all interact with the quantum vacuum 
differently.  
 
It is also possible that quarks do not have unique masses, and that their masses are different in 
different configurations (mesons and baryons), just as the combined mass is different in every 
case. If there however are unique masses, then those masses would have to account for 

everything quarks can do in different configurations.  
 
The potential of neutrons to decay is likely introducing additional self-energy to the system, 
which is associated with virtual weak interactions with the quantum vacuum. Potential energy, 
which is negative, should also not be neglected, however small its contribution may be.  
 
Proton mass 
 
While it is true that the masses of quarks are, to some degree, connected to the mesons and 
baryons they can form when they are combined, the masses of those mesons and baryons can be 
predicted, or post-dicted, from the quark masses, by performing a large number of very 
complicated calculations using quantum chromodynamics.  
 
This has been done with high accuracy by a group of American Chinese physicists in 2018. This 
does not mean we don’t have to worry about mesons and baryons here. If we want to one day 
understand the differences in mass of particles that have exactly the same kind of charge or 
hypercharge, we have to look at all mesons and baryons collectively.  
 
These differences in mass do not arise from the potential of forming mesons and baryons. That 
would be potential energy, and that is usually small and therefore neglectable. Instead, they arise 
from all the virtual quarks in the quantum vacuum. The potential to decay, for example, implies 
constant virtual interactions with W- and Z-bosons.  
 
Why are neutrons heavier than protons? 
 
Down-quarks have more mass than up-quarks, and as a consequence, neutrons, which consist of 
two down-quarks and one up-quark, have more mass than protons. This imbalance of mass is 
likely related to the neutrons potential to decay, when existing outside of a nucleus.  
 
The fact that the neutron is only about 2.5 electron masses heavier than an electron, strongly 
suggests that this additional mass is connected to the additional two particles that emerge after a 
neutron becomes a proton.  
 
When the neutron is outside the nucleus, it decays with a half-life of 10.5 min, into a proton, an 
electron and an anti-neutrino. This is known as beta-decay, and while the opposite, namely a 
proton turning into a neutron, while emitting a positron and a neutrino, is possible too, it never 
happens under normal conditions. Only the extreme pressure present in neutron stars, or black 
holes, can make such a thing happen.  
 
When a neutron turns into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino, it needs to have more 
energy than the mass energy of a proton. It could draw that energy from its kinetic energy, but 
that would imply that neutrons that are at rest cannot decay. That is not the case, and it would 
certainly be strange for a decay process to only be possible when kinetic energy is provided. It 
would also imply that in many situations all kinetic energy would be used to generate the masses 
of the particles, rendering all of them nearly immobilized. This would turn beta decay into a 
means of rapid cooling, which is rather problematic from the perspective of thermodynamics. 

Also, the uncertainty principle states that a temperature of absolute zero is not possible, because 
certainty in position generates uncertainty in impulse. Particles with small charges and masses 
have very large Compton wavelengths when at rest. If a neutrino was at rest, it would lower the 
already very low probability of detection to practically zero.  
 
Generally, particles that interact must have comparable wavelengths to do so. This is not only 
true for particles that collide, but also true for particles that are input and output of decay 
processes.  
 
Although a neutrino has a very small rest mass, it usually has just as much total energy as the 
electron. If the available energy was very small, such an equal distribution of impulse among 
electron and anti-neutrino would be impossible.  
 
From the above it is clear that the electrons produced in beta decay need a bit more energy than 
just the energy associated with their rest mass, say 1.25 of it, and for allowing an equal 
distribution of impulse, the same amount of energy should be available for the neutrinos as well, 
adding up to about 2.5 𝑚e.  
 
This is not yet a rigorous and precise derivation of the neutron mass, but being just a small 
multiple of the electron mass heavier than the proton, shows that it is most likely related to the 
beta decay.  
 
Of course, a question remaining is, why is it the neutron which is heavier and not the proton?  
 
A possible explanation is that beta-decay increases the entropy, because one particle becomes 
three particles. The inverse beta-decay would require exactly the right three particle to come 
together all in one point. This is highly unlikely and therefore associated with a big reduction in 
entropy. Inverse beta-decay therefore only becomes likely when matter is crushed and 
compressed, like it is the case in a neutron star, or a black hole.  
 
The origin of the mass of the W- and Z-boson 
 
Something that remains unexplained in this model is the fact that the W- and Z-bosons have such 
huge masses, apparently regardless of their charge.  
 
The Higgs mechanism which is now regarded to be the explanation for the existence of rest mass 
by most physicists, was originally conceived as an explanation for the masses of the W- and Z-
bosons only.  
 
The calculations in this chapter should have made clear now, that the Higgs mechanism should 
not have been extended beyond its original purpose. Doing so means to both overcomplicate 
things and to introduce arbitrary parameters into the theory.  
 
After all, the Higgs mechanism involves a field too, similar to the force fields we discussed 
above. It might well be that the masses of the W- and Z-bosons are somehow related to the 
energy of this field. If they are the only particles receiving their mass through the Higgs 

mechanism, then they must be the only particles interacting with the Higgs-boson, and thus their 
mass should be related to that of the Higgs-boson. This raises the question where the Higgs-
boson itself receives its mass from.  
 
It is as if the weak force was some strange mutation of the electromagnetic force where all the 
mass or charge of the electrons went into the photons. And indeed, the heavier the W- and Z-
bosons are, the weaker is the mass and hypercharge of the neutrino. If the different forces are just 
variations of the same underlying geometrical structure, then such inversions are to be expected.  
 
If the weak force is such a variation of the electromagnetic force, then its inverse could be the 
strong force. The transmitter particles of the strong force, the gluons, different from the massless 
photons of the electromagnetic force, do have a charge, namely the strong hypercharge. The self-
interaction of gluons makes it very hard to figure out how much energy individual gluons carry, 
let alone know if they have any non-zero mass. If the strong force is some form of inverse 
analogy to the weak force, then we could expect the gluons to have a mass that stands in the 
same relation to the quarks as the mass of the neutrinos stand to the mass of the W- and Z-bosons.  
 
Using the mean mass of up- and down-quarks, as well as the mean mass of W- and Z-bosons, 
results to the following mass for gluons:  
 
𝑚g
𝑚q𝜇
 = 
𝑚νe
𝑚W&Z𝜇
 
 
𝑚g  = 
𝑚νe 𝑚q𝜇
𝑚W&Z𝜇
 
 
𝑚g  =  4.9527995 × 10−42 kg 
 
Obviously, such a small mass can’t slow down gluons much. Similar to neutrinos, which are 
estimated to have a mass of 2.14 × 10−37 kg (average of three flavors), gluons would move 
very close to the speed of light.  
 
Our above hypothesis established a mass relation between fermions and their corresponding 
gauge bosons. It wasn’t able to predict the mass of the W- and Z-bosons. Is there any clue as to 
how it could be derived?  
 
When we translate the critical photon energy from chapter 3.5 into a mass, we get 2.4540028 ×
 10−26 kg. This is somewhat close to the average between the mass of the W- and the Z-bosons, 
which is at about 1.536 × 10−25 kg.  
 
According to space particle dualism, elementary spaces can merge as soon as they exceed the 
critical energy; the energy which makes them grow larger than their wavelength. The 
discrepancy of about one order of magnitude could then possibly be due to the running of 
coupling.  
 
The running of coupling can be understood as the result of diving into the cloud of polarized 

vacuum, which exposes the ‘naked mass’, or the ‘naked charge’ of the particle. Since mass and 
charge are correlated, a running of coupling should also imply a ‘running of mass’. At large 
scales the strong coupling reaches ‘1’. At the scale where weak interactions take place, the strong 
coupling is 𝛼S(𝑚Z) =  0.1185 ±  0.0005.11 Merging photon elementary spaces to create rest 
mass requires two photons of the critical energy. We thus multiply twice the critical mass of 
elementary spaces with this Z-pole strong coupling 𝛼S(𝑚Z):  
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 = 2 𝑀crit
𝛼S(𝑚Z) 
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 =  4.1417769 × 10−25 kg 
 
That is in the same order of magnitude as the actual mean mass of the W- and Z-boson. It is a 
37% agreement. However, the agreement with the mass of the Higgs-boson, which has a mass of 
2.2375 × 10−25 kg, is greater: 54%.  
 
It is conceivable that a single critical energy photon can turn into a Z-boson without merging 
with another critical energy photon. The idea that merging photon elementary spaces could 
generate mass is a reincarnation of the GR-idea that merging photons could generate mass by 
meeting in one point. However, even in general relativity, there is still another and more widely 
known way of generating mass out of photons. There, photons turn into black holes once they 
reach the Planck energy. The critical energy of SPD is analogous to the Planck energy.  
 
The Planck energy is only significant if gravity is generated by energy, and if Schwarzschild radii 
are smaller than elementary space radii. That means there is no SPD-version of the Planck energy. 
Nevertheless, the critical energy of elementary spaces is a very close analogy to the Planck 
energy.  
 
The fact that photons with higher energy than the critical energy exist makes it a bit hard to 
justify the hypothesis that W- and Z-bosons can be derived from single photons. On the other 
hand, we have associated merging elementary spaces with the three different generations of 
elementary particles.  
 
If a single photon of the critical energy is sufficient, then we get:  
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 = 𝑀crit
𝛼S(𝑚Z) 
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 =  2.0708885 × 10−25 kg 
 
This agrees with the actual mean mass to 74%. If we interpret this to actually be the Higgs-
boson mass, then we get a 93%.   
 
In chapter 6.8 we will discuss if the factor of 2 in the formula for the radius of elementary spaces 
is justified or not. No definite conclusion is reached there, but test this idea here, by using a 

critical energy and mass that is calculated without this factor of 2.  
 
Without the factor of 2 in the elementary space radius formula, the critical energy formula 
becomes:  
 
𝐸crit  = √ℎ 𝑐5
2 𝐺𝐸
 
 
𝐸crit  =  3.1191156 × 10−9 J 
 
Which corresponds to a critical mass of:  
 
𝑀crit  =  3.4704842 × 10−26 kg 
 
This yields:  
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 = 𝑀crit
𝛼S(𝑚Z) 
 
𝑚W&Z𝜇 =  2.9286786 × 10−25 kg 
 
This agrees with the W-Z average to 52%, and to the Higgs boson 76%. With our conventional 
elementary space radius, we got a better result. For a detailed discussion on the issue of the 
factor-2 problem see chapter 6.8.
