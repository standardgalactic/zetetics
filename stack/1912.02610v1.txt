ABSTRACT
Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task and an im-
portant step towards more natural human-machine interac-
tion. We show that pre-trained language models can be ﬁne-
tuned for text emotion recognition, achieving an accuracy of
69.5 % on Task 4A of SemEval 2017, improving upon the pre-
vious state of the art by over 3 % absolute. We combine these
language models with speech emotion recognition, achieving
results of 73.5 % accuracy when using provided transcriptions
and speech data on a subset of four classes of the IEMOCAP
dataset. The use of noise-induced transcriptions and speech
data results in an accuracy of 71.4 %. For our experiments, we
created IEmoNet, a modular and adaptable bimodal frame-
work for speech emotion recognition based on pre-trained
language models. Lastly, we discuss the idea of using an emo-
tional classiﬁer as a reward for reinforcement learning as a
step towards more successful and convenient human-machine
interaction.

1. INTRODUCTION
Emotions are an important aspect of human behavior. They
do not only inﬂuence the reaction to our environment [1, 2],
but also actively change our perception of it [3] and some-
times even contribute to how well we remember speciﬁc
events [4]. As such, they inﬂuence both human-human and
human-machine interaction.
However, in human-machine
interaction, emotions are often not at all or only scarcely
considered. We propose to use automatically generated emo-
tional feedback as a reward in Reinforcement Learning (RL).
This could be used to improve human-machine interaction,
for example when used with dialogue systems. In this paper,
we will focus on the tasks of automatic Text Emotion Recog-
nition (TER) and automatic Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER).
∗equal contribution
It has been shown that combining textual features and a
SER model into a multimodal system improves the overall
classiﬁcation performance [5, 6, 7, 8]. Additionally, the tasks
of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and language mod-
elling have seen great improvements over the last year. This
leads to a steady improvement in the quality of both tran-
scripts and language models. Since most language models
have been shown to be able to solve a plethora of different
tasks [9, 10], the combination of ASR and TER can be used
to automatically transcribe a given utterance and use the lan-
guage model for an emotion classiﬁcation. To show the ef-
fectiveness of language models for TER, we ﬁne-tune both
BERT [11] and XLNet [12], two self-attentive language mod-
els, on Task 4A of SemEval 2017 [13].
Motivated by these two recent advancements, we present
IEmoNet (Interactive Emotion Network) which is a modular
and adaptable bimodal SER framework based on pre-trained
language models. IEmoNetconsist of independently trainable
ASR, SER and TER sub-modules. They can be combined by
ﬁne-tuning only a few layers, omitting time-consuming re-
training of the whole model. This allows us to utilize both tex-
tual and paralinguistic features for emotion classiﬁcation. We
test our model on the ‘Text+Speech’ subtask of the Interac-
tive Emotional dyadic MOtion CAPture (IEMOCAP) dataset
[14]. Using 10-fold cross validation, IEmoNet achieves re-
sults of 73.5 % when combining text and speech inputs. Using
speech and (simulated) automatically transcribed texts instead
of the provided transcriptions results in 71.4 % accuracy.
2. RELATED WORK
IEmoNet is an approach to bimodal SER, meaning that it uses
different modalities to extract richer and more varied features.
In general, bi- and multimodal models combine modalities
such as video recordings [15], more speciﬁc facial features
[16], movements [17] and even EEG signals [18]. In our case
text, transcribed speech and speech are used, closely follow-
ing [7, 8, 19]. Previous research focused on the Time Delay
Neural Network (TDNN) [20] and recurrent architectures like
the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [21].
arXiv:1912.02610v1  [eess.AS]  29 Nov 2019

Recently, ELMo [22], an LSTM-based pre-trained lan-
guage model, has been successfully used to generate textual
features for multimodal emotion recognition [5]. We use pre-
trained language models based on Transformer encoder stacks
[23] instead. These Transformer encoder stacks rely solely
on the self-attention mechanism [24] for contextualization.
They have shown great potential for ASR, SER and (emo-
tional) language modelling individually, as will be shown in
the following sections.
2.1. Speech Emotion Recognition
SER has been studied for several decades [25], with early
work consisting of the classiﬁcation of a given utterance to
one of usually four distinct emotions based on prosodic fea-
tures such as pitch, speech and intensity [26, 27]. While these
relatively simple features are still used today, deep neural ar-
chitectures have led researchers to shift towards either more
features such as the IS09 emotional feature set [28], or more
or less unprocessed audio/signal data as input [29, 30].
Training and evaluating SER models is challenging be-
cause most datasets only include a few hours of spoken data,
making it difﬁcult to train large neural networks without se-
vere overﬁtting. Research on SER utilizes Mel Frequency
Cepstral Coefﬁcients (MFCCs), spectrograms and raw wave-
forms as inputs, while the architectures vary from gated re-
current units [31] to a combination of LSTMs and Time De-
lay Neural Networks (TDNNs) [32, 33]. Recently, the Trans-
former has also been used in SER, either directly [34] or as
a means of richer representations via predictive coding [35],
achieving competitive results in both cases.
2.2. Automatic Speech Recognition
While ASR faces similar challenges as SER, research has
shown that transfer between ASR and SER models is only
possible in early layers of the respective models, meaning that
both tasks require their respective models to learn vastly dif-
ferent features [36].
As of today, a few architectures have shown to be well
suited for ASR, all of which make either direct or indirect
use of neural networks. Looking at the LibriSpeech corpus
[37] as an example, Hybrid Models [38], Convolutional net-
works [39] and LSTMs [40, 41, 42] all achieve Word Error
Rates (WER) between 2.5 % and 3 % on the ’test-clean’ sub-
task when combined with a language model. Additionally,
researchers found that models based on the Transformer are
also competitive and very promising, especially in regards to
more complicated tasks [43, 44].
2.3. Text Emotion Recognition
TER is similar to sentiment analysis. Given an emotional
model, usually Ekman’s Base Emotions [45], the task is to
ﬁnd the dominant emotion in a text. Common approaches are
either keyword based or end-to-end. Keyword based methods
operate on strong emotional words [46] or are based around
meta expressions like hashtags [47], emoticons [48], and
emojis [49]. End-to-end architectures are mostly based on
LSTMs and the attention mechanism [50, 51], allowing the
models to correctly model long-term dependencies.
However, with the introduction of attention-based models
like the Transformer [23] model and later BERT [11], gen-
eral language models are currently achieving great results on
most Natural Language Understanding tasks, including senti-
ment analysis. An example is the GLUE Benchmark [52], a
collection of various Natural Language Understanding tasks.
Since GLUE’s release in 2018, BERT [11] and similar models
[12, 53, 54, 55] gave way to over a dozen improvements over
the state of the art and eventually led to surpassing human
performance on this benchmark1.
Additionally, some of these language models are provided
with pre-trained models and weights, allowing for efﬁcient
use of resources via transfer learning. These models can be
ﬁne-tuned on a given task, which means that some or all of
the existing weights are trained on the new task for relatively
few iterations. This drastically reduces both training time and
the necessary amount of training samples, making it ideal for
the data-sparse ﬁeld of Emotion Recognition. Utilizing this,
researchers have achieved good results in both combining lan-
guage models with LSTM architectures [56] and ﬁne-tuning
them on sentiment analysis tasks [57], showing that they are
suitable for the task at hand.
2.4. Emotion in Reinforcement Learning
In the context of dialogue systems (and human-machine in-
teraction in general) it seems rather important to integrate
the emotional state of the speaker into the overall decision
making process of an agent. As of now, emotions have been
used in both task-oriented [58] and non task-oriented dialogue
[59], in both cases increasing the performance of the given
system. Additionally, there has been a lot of research regard-
ing emotionally intelligent systems which implement and op-
erate based on their own emotional state [60].
3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Using emotion recognition for reinforcement learning in di-
alogue systems has the potential to greatly improve both the
systems usefulness and the users overall experience. For ex-
ample, a call center could track a caller’s anger [61] and an-
noyance [62] levels to see how satisﬁed they are with their
current call. In the case of a unsatisfactory calling experience,
the emotional reaction can then be interpreted as a negative
reward and used to adjust the dialogue system, causing it to
1See https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard (accessed
2019-10-14)

slightly change its behaviour and react more appropriately in
future calls.
However, there is an important distinction between emo-
tion and mood [63, 64], the main difference being the
timescale of both concepts [65].
While emotion itself is
short-term, its effects on a person’s mood might persist for
a relatively long time. In the context of dialogue systems,
this means that a particularly good dialogue turn might be
enough to cheer a person up and make them sound happier
for the rest of the interaction.
This again generates more
‘happy’ features for the next turns, causing the SER system
to classify what would normally be ‘neutral’ as ‘happy’. To
counteract this effect of a ‘lingering’ mood, we propose to
use an approximated derivative of the emotional state instead
of the state itself. For an emotion e and a dialogue history
ht at dialogue turn t, the output of the emotion recognition
system can be seen as the posterior probability P(e|h). The
delta ∆P(e|ht) = P(e|ht) −P(e|ht−1) of each individual
probability can then be seen as the resulting change in its
corresponding emotion based on the last dialogue turn.
Additionally, certain messages are expected to have cer-
tain emotional responses. Being the proverbial bearer of bad
news, for example, a dialogue system should not perceive an
anticipated negative emotion as a negative reward. Mathemat-
ically, this can be seen as the difference between the probabil-
ities of the estimated emotional response P est(e|ht) and the
actual response P(e|ht) of the dialogue turn in question. Con-
sidering mood, the unexpected change becomes ∆P(e|ht) −
∆P est(e|ht).
Since a reward for reinforcement learning is usually
bounded by a ﬁxed interval, a mapping f : E →[p, q]
between the set of emotions E and their reward is necessary.
In our case, a negative emotion like ‘anger’ would be mapped
to a negative value, the simplest case being −1. Taking this
into account, the actual reward rt used for reinforcement
learning would be
rt =
X
e∈E
f(e) · (∆P(e|ht) −∆P est(e|ht)).
(1)
Given that it is easier to give an estimated reward rather than
a set of changes in emotions, this can be simpliﬁed to
rt =
X
e∈E
f(e) · ∆P(e|ht) −rest
t
,
(2)
where rest
t
is the estimated reward for dialogue turn t and
could be inferred from e.g. another neural network via re-
gression.
4. MODEL
The IEmoNet framework consists of ﬁve parts. A given ut-
terance is ﬁrst forwarded into a pre-processing block, where
both ASR and SER features are extracted from the same raw
signal. These features are then fed into an ASR and a (neu-
ral) SER System respectively. The ASR System automatically
generates a transcript of the utterance, which is then used as
an input for the (also neural) TER System. Both the spoken
and the TER system then provide their outputs as independent
features for the classiﬁcation block. Finally, the classiﬁcation
block outputs the detected emotion. An overview can be seen
in Figure 1.
Fig. 1.
The IEmoNet framework where each intermediate
system (ASR, SER, TER) can be chosen and optimized indi-
vidually.
This framework is very versatile and easily adaptable.
The intermediate systems, i.e. the ASR, SER and TER sys-
tems, can be chosen and optimized independently, the only
ﬁxed variables being the input and the output size. Training
IEmoNet is done in multiple steps. First the preprocessing
block extracts ASR and SER features.
Depending on the
used sub-systems, the ASR features can range from classic
MFCCs+Deltas to augmented waveforms as used in [42]. For
the SER features either classical features such as pitch and
prosody [26, 27], complex emotion recognition feature sets

(for example the IS09 set [28]) or augmented waveforms [32]
are plausible.
After this, the utterances need to be transcribed to pro-
vide textual data. We found that modern out-of-the-box ASR
systems generally provide high-quality transcriptions without
the need for additional ﬁne-tuning, allowing us to simply use
one of these systems to transcribe the given utterances. Note
that ﬁne-tuning an ASR system towards a given dataset would
probably provide slightly better transcriptions, leading to a
slightly better performance overall. However, this comes at
the cost of signiﬁcantly more training time.
The SER and TER systems are trained individually on
their parts of the given task, i.e. speech to emotion for SER
and (possibly previously transcribed/generated) text to emo-
tion for TER. For this, both models are extended by an aux-
iliary classiﬁcation block followed by a softmax layer, effec-
tively creating two independent recognition systems.
After this step is ﬁnished, we combine the SER and TER
systems by removing the classiﬁcation and softmax layers
and replacing them with the classiﬁcation block, leaving their
second-to-last layers as the next block’s input features. The
classiﬁcation block usually consists of a simple feedforward
network with a softmax classiﬁcation layer. However, more
sohpisticated approaches employing the attention mechanism
might be better suited at aligning the two sets of features. The
classiﬁcation block is then trained while keeping the interme-
diate systems (ASR, SER and TER) unchanged. This is done
to prevent potential overﬁtting due to huge relative differences
in model size and structure.
A big advantage of this modular setup is that any in-
termediate system can simply be replaced by one another,
requiring at worst the re-training of the classiﬁcation block
and the extraction of new/other features in the pre-processing
block. This proves to be especially useful considering the
ongoing rapid development in both emotion recognition and
deep learning in general. IEmoNet can adapt to these im-
provements by upgrading an outdated sub-system to a newer
one without re-training all of the model.
5. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS / RESULTS
5.1. Pre-trained Language Models
The performance of IEmoNet only relies on the ability of its
intermediate systems to process sequence data. We found that
using pre-trained language models for the TER part drasti-
cally improves performance while only taking very few train-
ing epochs to converge. For our experiments, we use BERT
[11] and XLNet [12], two popular transformer-based general
language model that are available with pre-trained weights.
They both consist of either 24 (Large) or 12 (Base) Encoder
Transformer blocks and are pre-trained on large resources of
textual data. For a detailed description of the Encoder Trans-
former block, see [23].
We use the case-sensitive (cased)

versions of both models. Training BERT and XLNet on all
tasks was conducted using the Adam-optimizer [66] with a
learning rate of 3e −5. We use the provided WordPiece em-
beddings for BERT and byte-pair encodings for XLNet. The
sequence length is set to 48. Longer/Shorter inputs are trun-
cated/padded. We add a fully-connected layer of 768 units
with Dropout [67] of 0.2 and L2-regularization of 0.03 be-
tween the pre-trained models and the softmax layer. We use
weighted cross-entropy as our loss function to counteract the
imbalanced datasets. These hyperparameters were chosen ex-
perimentally and work equally well on both SemEval and
IEMOCAP.
5.2. SemEval Experiments
We found that using pre-trained language models and ﬁne-
tuning them on emotional datasets achieves good results. In
addition, ﬁne-tuning instead of training from scratch signif-
icantly reduces training time and resource usage. To show
the effectiveness of pre-trained language models for TER, we
run some tests on Task 4A of the SemEval 2017 competition
[13], which is a 3-class sentiment analysis task. The input is a
tweet (a twitter post containing no more than 280 characters),
the output is the predicted sentiment, in this case either ‘pos-
itive’, ‘neutral’, or ‘negative’. We choose this task because of
its similarity to TER. The sentiments may be roughly mapped
to the emotions ‘happy’, ‘neutral’ and ‘sad’/‘angry’.
The dataset is hand-annotated and consists of about
50.000 training and 12.000 test samples consisting of tweets
from 2012 to 2017. In the training set, the data consists of
roughly 39.5/44.8/15.6 % positive/neutral/negative tweets
while the test set has a distribution of 19.3/48.3/32.3 % for
the respective classes. In both cases, neutral tweets are the
most common. However, the training data has a lot more pos-
itive tweets while the test set is more shifted towards negative
ones. This causes the task to be more challenging because
the models need to detect negative sentiments with relatively
little training data.

We experiment with both BERT and XLNet and ﬁnd XL-
Net to be slightly superior in performance. The tweets were
not pre-processed.
The results can be seen in Table 1. We train each model
ﬁve times with different initial weights and report the mean
and standard deviation for each model.
Our best model
(XLNet-Base) achieves an accuracy of 69.5 % after only one
epoch of training. This is an improvement of over 3% ab-
solute over previous models, showing the effectiveness of
pre-trained models for this task.
5.3. IEMOCAP Experiments
The IEMOCAP dataset provides 12 hours of emotional audio
dialogues, recorded with ﬁve pairs of professional actors in
both scripted and spontaneous sessions. At least three anno-
tators were asked to label each of the dialogues using Ekmans
Base Emotions [45] and a variation of Russells Circumplex
Model [70]. The inter-annotator agreement for the task was
74.6 % (66.0 % for scripted and 83.1 % for spontaneous utter-
ances) [14]. Because of the scarcity of other emotions, we
follow common research [8, 33, 7] and only classify the emo-
tions ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘anger’ and ‘neutral’. Our ﬁnal
dataset contains 38.04 % neutral, 24.57 % angry, 24.14 % sad
and 13.24 % happy samples. We split each dialogue into ut-
terances from 3 to 15 seconds, with one utterance holding
the information of one speaker (i.e. mono audio data and
the respective transcription). Each utterance is then classiﬁed
individually and without context information. We use both
scripted and spontaneous dialogues for all experiments.
We use 10-fold cross-validation with randomly shufﬂed
data with a ﬁxed random seed. Note that some researchers
(e.g. [33, 5]) test their models in a speaker-exclusive setting
instead. They split the dataset by speakers, training on most
speakers and testing exclusively on the remaining few. We
denote the respective papers with a ‘*’. We train each model
three times with different initial weights and report the mean
of all models and the mean of the three standard deviations.
We evaluate the models with respect to weighted and un-
weighted accuracy. The Weighted Accuracy (WA) is given by
the number of correctly classiﬁed samples divided by the total
number of samples. The Unweighted Accuracy (UA) corre-
sponds to ﬁrst calculating the accuracy for each emotion class
and then averaging by the number of samples per class.
5.3.1. IEMOCAP Text Experiments
As described in Section 4, we train IEmoNet’s modalities
independently at ﬁrst.
Motivated by their performance on
the SemEval task (see Section 5.2), we use both BERT and
XLNet as TER models. We use the Base versions (i.e. 12
Transformer Encoder Blocks) for all experiments because
they are roughly three times smaller than the large ones, mak-
ing them more feasible for real-time applications. To compare

the theoretical and the practical performance, we train on both
provided and artiﬁcial ASR transcriptions [71, 72] with 6 %
WER. The latter are used as an alternative to an ASR system
and are conﬁgured to simulate typical transcription errors as
described in [71]. This WER was chosen to match the one
reported in [8]. We use artiﬁcial noise instead of an ASR
system due to time constraints to integrate an ASR of high
quality.
For all text-related experiments, we omitted the use of a
validation split, instead training on a ﬁxed number of seven
epochs for all folds. The number seven was chosen because
the training loss usually stabilized after seven epochs. The re-
sults can be seen in Table 2. Here, BERT slightly outperforms
XLNet, achieving an accuracy of 70.9 % on the provided tran-
scripts and 68.5 % on the noisy ones. While our models’ per-
formances still drops signiﬁcantly when using noisy instead
of provided transcriptions, they seem to be more robust to this
noise than the one reported in [8]. We hypothesize that the ex-
tensive pre-training on large amounts of textual data leads to
this increase in stability.
5.3.2. IEMOCAP Speech Experiments
For the SER part, we train our models on the IS09 feature set
[28], following previous research [34, 73]. The features were
extracted using the openSMILE feature extraction tool [74]
with a frame size of 300 frames and a stride of 0.1, resulting in
an overlap of 0.9 between two frames. We then pad/truncate
the sequences to a ﬁxed length of 384 frames.
The results in Table 3 are achieved using simple Attention-
BiLSTM models. The models use a TDNN layer followed by
two BiLSTM layers and an attention layer. The TDNN layer
is used to map the inputs to the dimension of the BiLSTMs.
The output of the second BiLSTM layer is then fed into the at-
tention layer. Then, the outputs of the second BiLSTM layer
and the attention layer are concatenated and used as the input
for a softmax layer. Our best model, BiLSTM-128attDim,

It achieved an accuracy of 60.8 %. The second best model,
BiLSTM-64attDim, uses the same conﬁguration, except for
an attention dimension of 64, achieving 60.0 % weighted
accuracy.
Note that more sophisticated SER models have
been shown to yield far better performance and would thus be
better suited for a combined bimodal architecture. However,
we primarily want to showcase the capability of pre-trained
language models for bimodal Emotion Recognition, making
these basic models sufﬁcient for this purpose.
5.3.3. IEMOCAP Bimodal Experiments
We combine our best individual models as described in Sec-
tion 4.
Again, each model is trained for a ﬁxed number
of seven epochs.
The results can be found in Table 4.
IEmoNet(XL)
uses the best XLNet models from Table 2
as its text sub-system while IEmoNet(BE) uses the BERT
models instead. Both combine them with the best SER model
from Table 3.
We also tried ﬁne-tuning the whole model
(i.e.
the classiﬁcation block, the TER and the SER parts
together) after the seven epochs. However, the performance
was signiﬁcantly worse than the models that only trained the
classiﬁcation block. This is likely caused by the size of BERT
and XLNet allowing them to easily dominate the classiﬁca-
tion outcome. The best models achieve 73.5 % and 71.4 %
accuracy for provided and automatic transcripts respectively.
6. CONCLUSION / FUTURE WORK
Detecting emotions in speech is a challenging task that marks
an important step towards more natural and adaptive human-
computer interaction. We show that self-attentive pre-trained
language models are well suited for text emotion recogni-
tion and that the Transformer model in general works well
for bimodal Emotion Recognition. Our experiments result in
69.5 % accuracy on Task 4A of SemEval 2017. We achieve
73.5 % and on the ‘Text+Speech’ subtask of the IEMOCAP
dataset. Using speech and (simulated) automatic transcrip-
tions results in 71.4 % instead. The results on IEMOCAP
are achieved by ﬁne-tuning BERT and combining it with a
traditional speech emotion recognition system. This is done
using IEmoNet, a modular framework that classiﬁes both the
speech data and a textual transcription in independent sub-
modules that can be switched out without pre-training the
whole model.
We suggest using Speech Emotion Recognition as a re-
ward for Reinforcement Learning. It could be used to improve
the quality of dialogue systems by allowing them to adjust
their behaviour based on the emotional reactions of their di-
alogue partner. We mention possible problems that arise due
to different aspects of human emotion and propose a suitable
reward function to circumvent them.
Future work will involve the implementation of our
framework into a Reinforcement Learning agent as well as
more sophisticated combinations of Speech Emotion Recog-
nition sub-modules. We will also repeat our experiments with
an ASR system instead of artiﬁcial noise. Another possible
direction is to optimize pre-trained language models for emo-
tional context, for example by adding an additional training
step before ﬁne-tuning them on a given task.
