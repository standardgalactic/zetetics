Zeeman Eﬀect
The Zeeman eﬀect is the splitting of spectral lines observed in the
presence of a magnetic field (Figure Z.1). In the normal Zeeman eﬀect,
which is characteristic of atoms and ions with S ¼ 0, spectral lines are
split into three. It arises from the removal of the degeneracy of states

J
with diﬀerent values of MJ in conjunction with the selection
rules DMJ ¼ 0, 1. In the anomalous Zeeman eﬀect, splitting into more
than three lines are observed. The eﬀect arises on account of the
diﬀerent magnetic properties of terms as expressed by the Landé
g-factor in combination with the same selection rules. The two eﬀects
are illustrated below for the transitions 1P - 1S (normal) and 3P - 3S
(anomalous).

Zeroth-order Reaction
A zeroth-order reaction is one for which the rate is independent of the
concentration of the reactants and, provided some are present, the
rate law is v ¼ kr. The integrated form of the rate law for a reaction
A - P is
[A] ¼
[A]0  krt; 0rtr[A]0=kr
[A]0; t4[A]0=kr
(
The half-life is
t1=2 ¼ [A]0
2kr
Zeroth-order reactions are often encountered in surface chemistry
where the rate-determining step takes place after fast adsorption has
occurred. A pseudozeroth-order reaction is encountered in solution
when a reactant is in such great excess that its concentration remains
constant in the course of the reaction.
Zero-point Energy
The zero-point energy is the irremovable, lowest energy that a system
may possess as a result of quantum mechanical constraints. For a
particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L, the lowest
energy state has n ¼ 1 and
E1 ¼

For a harmonic oscillator of frequency o, the lowest energy state has
v ¼ 0 and
E0 ¼ 1

A rotor of any geometry has no zero-point energy. In general, the
magnitude of the zero-point energy, when it is nonzero, decreases
with increasing mass.
Zeroth Law
The Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if A is in thermal
equilibrium with B when they are in contact through diathermic

walls, and B is in thermal equilibrium with C when they are likewise
in contact, then C would be in thermal equilibrium with A when they
are brought into contact (Figure Z.2). The law establishes the concept
of temperature, for A, B, and C are all in mutual thermal equilibrium if
they have the same value of a property that is called ‘temperature’.
Moreover, the law establishes the concept of a thermometer, a device
for measuring temperature, with B playing that role; for if B displays
the same temperature as A when it is in thermal contact with it, and if
B also displays the same temperature when it is in contact with C,
then it is known that A and C have the same temperature and would
therefore be in thermal equilibrium if they were placed in thermal
contact.
Zone Refining
In the technique of zone refining, which is used to purify a solid, a
train of narrow molten bands is passed along a bar of the impure
material; impurities collect in the molten region and are carried to the
end of the sample. In the modification known as zone levelling, the
pure material is doped uniformly by dragging a molten zone con-
taining the dopant repeatedly in alternate directions through the
sample.
