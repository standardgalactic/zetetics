We compute the classical eﬀective action of color charges moving along worldlines by integrating
out the Yang-Mills gauge ﬁeld to next-to-leading order in the coupling. An adapted version of the
Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double-copy construction known from quantum scattering ampli-
tudes is then applied to the Feynman integrands, yielding the prediction for the classical eﬀective
action of point masses in dilaton gravity.
We check the validity of the result by independently
constructing the eﬀective action in dilaton gravity employing ﬁeld redeﬁnitions and gauge choices
that greatly simplify the perturbative construction. Complete agreement is found at next-to-leading
order. Finally, upon performing the post-Newtonian expansion of our result, we ﬁnd agreement with
the corresponding action of scalar-tensor theories known from the literature. Our results represent
a proof of concept for the classical double-copy construction of the gravitational eﬀective action and
provides another application of a BCJ-like double copy beyond scattering amplitudes.

INTRODUCTION
There is a growing body of evidence for a fascinat-
ing perturbative duality between Yang-Mills theory and
quantum gravity known as the double-copy construction
or color-kinematics duality due to Bern, Carrasco and Jo-
hansson (BCJ) [1–3]. It provides a concrete prescription
for transforming scattering amplitudes in non-Abelian
gauge theories into scattering amplitudes in gravitational
theories upon replacing the non-Abelian color degrees of
freedom by kinematical ones. In the simplest scenario
pure Yang-Mills theory double copies to dilaton gravity
coupled to an axion also termed as N = 0 supergrav-
ity (the massless sector of bosonic strings). This relation
was proven for tree-level amplitudes [2], where the double
copy is equivalent to the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations of
string theory [4], a precursor of the BCJ duality. It is also
manifest in the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulation of gluon
and graviton tree-level amplitudes [5]. While remaining
conjectural at the loop level, the double-copy procedure
is extremely eﬃcient in generating integrands for gravi-
tational theories at high-perturbative orders in theories
with and without supersymmetry [6–14] and as such has
passed many nontrivial checks. The present record being
at the four point ﬁve-loop level for maximal supergravity
[15]. Moreover, an elaborate web of theories connected
via color-kinematics duality exists that includes matter
couplings and various numbers of supersymmetries [16–
18]. All these results point towards the double copy being
a generic property of gravity alluding at a hidden kine-
matical algebra which has resisted discovery so far.
In light of these ﬁndings the natural question arises,
whether the double copy generalizes beyond the realm
of scattering amplitudes. In particular, does it also play

a role in classical general relativity? Here a number of
encouraging results have been obtained: Schwarzschild,
Kerr and Taub-NUT spacetimes were shown to be dou-
ble copies of classical gauge-theory solutions [19, 20],
were further extended to certain classes of perturbative
spacetimes [21], and a classical double-copy description of
the gravitational radiation from accelerating black holes
was developed in Ref. [22]. Following up the last direc-
tion, a very interesting setting is that of gravitational
radiation produced by binary sources, not the least due
to the spectacular observations of gravitational waves
and the need for high precision predictions to generate
waveform templates [23]. Pioneering work was done in
[24–26] where perturbative classical solutions for binary
color-charged point particles coupled via Yang-Mills the-
ory [27] were shown to double copy to their counter-
parts in dilaton-gravity radiation (see also [28, 29]). In
these works certain color-kinematics replacement rules
were employed which appear somewhat distinct to the
color factor/numerator replacement rules familiar from
scattering amplitudes.
Also the question of a double-
copy-respecting representation of the perturbative gauge-
theory solutions remained open.
This situation was
clariﬁed very recently in the work of Shen [30], which
pushed the perturbative approach of solving the equa-
tions of motions via double copy to the next-to-leading
order in the coupling constant expansion. In this process
a color-kinematics duality representation of the Yang-
Mills-radiation solution was found, which parallels the
color-kinematics duality rules of BCJ [1] and replaces
the nonstandard double-copy rules of [24]. An alterna-
tive route for ﬁnding the graviton radiation of binaries
via the double copy was taken in [31], where a tree scat-
tering amplitude in gauge theory coupled to scalar ﬁelds
was double copied to establish the leading order gravita-
tional radiation emitted from the scattering of two black
holes (modeled by two massive scalar ﬁelds).
In our present work, we generalize these approaches
to the double copy of gravitationally interacting bina-
ries by ascending from the level of equations of motion

to the classical eﬀective action.
This approach makes
direct contact to the post-Minkowskian (weak-ﬁeld) and
post-Newtonian (weak-ﬁeld and slow-motion) expansions
of the gravitational potential for which high-order re-
sults exist in the literature, namely at the fourth post-
Newtonian order (four loop) for nonspinning bodies: us-
ing a canonical formalism of general relativity [32], a
Fokker Lagrangian [33, 34], and partial results within
an eﬀective ﬁeld theory formalism [35]. The latter makes
use of Feynman diagrammatic methods and sophisticated
tools for eﬀective ﬁeld theories in the context of classi-
cal gravity [36].
The question how the classical gravi-
tational potential may be extracted from the quantum
scattering amplitude of massive scalars has in fact a long
history starting in the 1970s [37–39]. Recent works have
updated this by employing modern unitarity methods of
quantum ﬁeld theory [40–42]. Damour recently proposed
an alternative approach for converting scattering angles
and amplitudes to the eﬀective one-body Hamiltonian
[43, 44].
Hence, in order to perform the construction
of the interaction potential using the double copy, one
could study the scattering amplitude of a massive scalar
ﬁeld coupled to either Yang-Mills or dilaton-gravity the-
ory and relate to a potential using one of the mentioned
works. Representing the gauge-theory result in a color-
kinematics respecting fashion should then yield the eﬀec-
tive gravitational potential via a suitably deﬁned double
copy. Here we follow a more direct approach, where the
classical interaction potential is the direct outcome of a
path integral. For this purpose, we start out with color
charges moving along a worldline as in [24–26, 30]. This
may be viewed as a classical limit of the massive scalar
ﬁeld.
Our paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we give
an overview of the structure of a theory of classical color-
charged massive point particles moving along worldlines,
interacting via a Yang-Mills theory, in the ﬁrst-order for-
malism. In Sec. III three we propose a double-copy pre-
scription for the classical eﬀective action. We compute
the eﬀective action of the theory introduced in Sec. II up
to next-to-leading order in the gluon coupling.
Along
the way we introduce the notion of a trivalent repre-
sentation for graphs involving worldlines and at the end
of the section we perform the double copy. In Sec. IV
we repeat the computation of the eﬀective action in the
weak-ﬁeld/post-Minkowskian approximation for massive
point particles interacting in dilaton-gravity theory and
we compare the resulting expression to the double-copy
result. In Sec. V we reexpand our result for the post-
Minkowskian dilaton-gravity eﬀective action in velocities,
thus yielding the post-Newtonian approximation. After
solving the Feynman integrals, we compare the resulting
expression to known results in the literature. Our conclu-
sions are presented in Sec. VI. Finally, our conventions,
the Feynman rules and a discussion of self-interactions
can be found in the appendices.

YANG-MILLS INTERACTION OF
COLOR-CHARGED MASSIVE PARTICLES
We consider the worldline action of a massive, color-
charged (non-Abelian) point particle coupled to the
Yang-Mills gauge ﬁeld Aa
µ; see appendix A for notation
and conventions.
The action for the classical colored
point charge (pc) is given by [24, 25, 27]
Spc = −

(2)
which is invariant under reparametrization of τ.
Here
uµ = ˙xµ is the 4-velocity of the particle along the world-
line xµ(τ) and ψ(τ) an associated fundamental vector
carrying the color degrees of freedom of the particle –
often called the color wave function. Moreover
ca := ψ†T aψ ,
(3)
is the color charge carried by the particle. In this form,
there is only a single gluon coupling to the scalar world-
line. As the gravity counterpart also has higher graviton
couplings to the worldline of a massive particle, this poses
an immediate obstacle to a double-copy relation. Also a
massive scalar ﬁeld, for which a double copy of scattering
amplitudes exist [31], has linear and quadratic couplings
to gluons. However, in a ﬁrst-order formalism this situa-
tion is remedied. Deﬁning canonical momenta
pµ = ∂Lpc
∂uµ = m uµ

(6)
Here, Hcan is the “canonical” Hamiltonian and Hpc is
the “Dirac” Hamiltonian where the mass-shell constraint
was added using a Lagrange multiplier λ(τ).
Now we
have both a single and a double gluon coupling to the
worldline, similar to a massive scalar ﬁeld.
Note that
λ(τ)dτ is reparametrization invariant.
We now consider Yang-Mills gauge theory coupled to
a set of two scalar particles in the worldline descrip-
tion. Notationally we separate the worldlines by placing
a tilde on all variables associated to one of the worldlines.

Therefore the full action for classical Yang-Mills (cYM)
reads
ScYM = SYM + Sgf + Spc + ˜Spc ,
(7)
where a gauge ﬁxing part Sgf was added. With this, the
gluon propagator reads
⟨Aa

ν(y)⟩0 = ℏ
i ηµν δab D(x −y) ,
(8)
where D(x −y) is deﬁned via
□D(x −y) = −δ(x −y) .

EFFECTIVE ACTION OF COLORED
MASSIVE PARTICLES AND ITS DOUBLE COPY
A.
Principle of the double-copy construction
The double-copy scheme to be applied here is to ﬁrst
integrate out the gauge ﬁeld Aa
µ in order to obtain the
eﬀective action Seﬀ,YM for two colored, massive particles
with Yang-Mills interactions, i.e.
e

ℏSeff,YM = e

ℏSpc,freeMYM = const
Z

The (divergent) normalization constant on the right-hand
side is chosen such that MYM = 1 for g →0 and Spc,free
is given by Spc + ˜Spc for g →0. The perturbative expan-
sion in the coupling g of MYM can always be brought
into the schematic form

where Γn is the set of Nn−1LO trivalent graphs with two
external worldlines of the colored point particles, CI de-
notes the color factor associated with graph I, i.e. func-
tions of the c(τ)’s, NI the associated kinematic numera-
tor factors and DI the spacetime propagators appearing
in the graph I. The xI is deﬁned as the number of vertices
(bulk and worldline) minus the number of propagators in
the trivalent diagram and lI is the number of bulk ver-
tices. Note that the integral measure along the worldline
dτ always comes with a corresponding Lagrange multi-
plier λ(τ) in order to guarantee reparametrization invari-
ance. We collect this into a new density notation via
dˆτi := dτi λ(τi) .
(12)
The SI ﬁnally, denote the symmetry factor of the graph
I in the trivalent representation, i.e. the graph has to be
drawn in such a way that it reproduces the color structure
CI. We will explain our notion of a trivalent representa-
tion more precisely in the next section.
The double-copy prescription that we are adopting
here then amounts to representing the exponential of
the eﬀective action of two massive particles coupled to a
weak-ﬁeld (post-Minkowskian) expansion of dilaton grav-
ity (dg) as

ℏSpc,freeMdg. Only classical terms (ℏ→0)
are retained in Seﬀ,dg in our considerations. At higher
order, CI and NI are required to fulﬁll the usual BCJ
color-kinematics duality (Jacobi relations). We conclude
this section by stressing that our double-copy prescrip-
tion is proposed at the level of M and not at the level of
the eﬀective action.
B.
The trivalent representation of the eﬀective
action of colored particles to next-to-leading order
We now compute the eﬀective action for two color-
charged massive point particles moving on their world-
lines to next-to-leading order, O(g4). Furthermore, we
will clarify what we mean by a trivalent representation
of a diagram involving worldlines. We will use the short-
hand notation
ci := c(τi),
pi := p(τi),
Dij := D(x(τi) −x(τj)),
dˆτ1...n :=
n
Y
i=1
dτi λ(τi) . (14)
Additionally, we will use the tilde notation for the “right”
worldline in our diagrams.
At leading order we have the three graphs
τ1
˜τ2
= 4g2 i
ℏ
Z
dˆτ1˜2(c1 · ˜c2) (p1 · ˜p2) D1˜2 ,

(16)
τ1

dτ1D11 = 0
in dim. reg.
(17)
Since the last term vanishes in dimensional regulariza-
tion, we neglect any graph involving a bubble, as shown

4
above, or any other scaleless integral. Note that we do
not mention the mirrored counterparts to every graph
with an uneven number of untilded and tilded variables.
They can be trivially obtained by replacing untilded and
tilded and it is understood that we add them to our ﬁnal
results.
At the next-to-leading order we encounter the graphs

(19)
where we used a delta function in the last step in order to introduce a dummy τ3 integration. This can be understood
as pulling apart the gluon-gluon-worldline vertex into two gluon-worldline vertices, i.e. arriving at our deﬁnition of a
trivalent representation necessary for our proposed double-copy prescription (13).

We also have graphs that are not mirrored counterparts
of above mentioned graphs, i.e.

,
(26)
which we only include implicitly due to their very similar
analytic form as previously computed graphs. In addition
we neglect graphs that represent quantum corrections,
since they are suppressed in the classical eﬀective action.
In particular we neglect the following type of graphs
,
(27)
where the grey blob denotes loop topologies.
C.
The double copy of the gauge-theory eﬀective
action
In order to perform the double copy according to (11)
we ﬁrst need to investigate the independent color struc-
tures from the previous section. They are given by
LO: (c · ˜c), (c · c), (˜c · ˜c).
NLO: (c · ˜c)2, (c · ˜c) (˜c · ˜c), (˜c · c)(c · c), (c · c)2, (˜c · ˜c)2,
(28)
f abccacbcc, f abcca˜cb˜cc, f abc˜cacbcc, f abc˜ca˜cb˜cc,
yielding the backbone to write down the terms in (11).
We start with the H-graph

(29)
where
CH = (c1 · ˜c2),

Turning to next-to-leading order contributions, we have

(38)
Note that here we use the symmetry factor of the ﬁrst topology of the C-graph. This is consistent with our double-copy
prescription which states that the correct symmetry factor is the one attributed to the trivalent graph.
Next in line is the B-graph

Again, the symmetry factor is given by the ﬁrst topology of the B-graph.
The same constructions apply to the mirrored graphs and the graphs mentioned in (26). Performing the double copy
as discussed in Sec. III A yields our prediction for the exponential of the eﬀective action in dilaton gravity

this point it is necessary to comment on a subtle feature of the above result. An essential technicality in the previous
construction was the notion of pulling apart the gluon-gluon-worldline vertex using a delta function, i.e. obtaining a
trivalent representation. Doing so, our double-copy prescription introduces δ(0) terms in
¯
Mdg. This is a potential
hazard but since such terms are of O(ℏ0), they are quantum corrections to Seﬀ,dg and we neglect them for the time
being.
Another important property of Seﬀ,dg is that all negative powers of ℏexponentiate, which is a priori not obvious.
We check this by taking the logarithm of our double-copy result, obtaining a perturbative expansion of the eﬀective
action,

tion within dilaton gravity reproduces this prediction.

Weak-ﬁeld expansion

sion of the full metric around a ﬂat Minkowski back-
ground, i.e.

where κ is our weak-ﬁeld (or post-Minkowskian) pertur-
bation parameter and hµν is the graviton. In principle we
are ready to start the computation of the eﬀective action
by integrating out the graviton and dilaton ﬁeld. Nev-
ertheless, at this point one encounters large expressions
during intermediate steps, e.g. the three-graviton vertex
will have around 170 terms [47]. However, it is known
that one can achieve a high simpliﬁcation by perform-
ing ﬁeld redeﬁnitions and adding the appropriate gauge
ﬁxings [48]. Here, we aim at a ﬁeld redeﬁnition that re-
moves the coupling of the dilaton to the worldline and
also simpliﬁes the three-graviton vertex to the square of
the Yang-Mills one. Our procedure is given by:

Now that we have obtained all classical contributions
from integrating out the graviton and dilaton, we can

(73)
where the last term comes from the diﬀerence between
Spc,free and Spm,free. However, the dynamics of the auxil-

10
iary ﬁeld ψ is now decoupled and trivial such that it may
be dropped. Therefore we conclude that our double-copy
prescription (13) yields the correct classical eﬀective ac-
tion up to next-to-leading order in the weak-ﬁeld expan-
sion.
V.
POST-NEWTONIAN EVALUATION OF THE
EFFECTIVE ACTION
In this section, we evaluate the eﬀective action in the
post-Newtonian approximation. After adopting a gauge
for the worldline parameter, the equations of motion for
the Lagrange multipliers λ and the energies p0 of the
particles become algebraic and these variables can be
eliminated from the action. This leads to an action in
Hamiltonian form, which agrees with previous results in
scalar-tensor theory [49], that includes dilaton gravity as
a special case.
The post-Newtonian approximation is a reﬁnement of
the weak-ﬁeld approximation to bound binaries.
The
third Kepler law, or the virial theorem, then tells us that
(with equality in the circular orbit case)
v2
r
c2 ∼κ2(m + ˜m)
c232πr
,
(74)
where r = |x −˜x|, vr is the relative velocity of the two
particles, and we have restored the speed of light c. The
weak-ﬁeld approximation therefore implies small veloc-
ities in the case of bound binaries. It is convenient to
use c−1 as a formal post-Newtonian counting parameter,
such that κ = O(c−1) as well as
(uµ) = (1, v) = (O(c0), O(c−1)),
(75)
(pµ) = (E, −p) = (O(c0), O(c−1)),
(76)
λ = O(c0) and ∂t = O(c−1). The post-Newtonian ex-
pansion of the propagator then reads

Recall that the eﬀective action is invariant under
reparametrizations of the worldline parameters. We may
therefore pick a gauge for them. In the post-Newtonian
approximation, it is useful to ﬁx τ = t = coordinate time.
Then the eﬀective action is the sum of the free terms
Spm,free and the connected graphs shown in (72). Most
of these graphs are actually vanishing self-interactions,
see Appendix B. This leaves us with (stripping oﬀthe
overall factors i/ℏ)

Moreover in (78) we anticipated that λ = const +

Notice the extra factor of 2 in the Newtonian potential,
which is due to the dilaton.
Throughout this deriva-
tion, higher-order time derivatives (like accelerations)
are removed by inserting the respective equations of mo-
tion. This corresponds to a variable redeﬁnition at the
considered order [50].
[In particular, this justiﬁes the
dropping of time derivatives of λ, E and the use of
p = mv + O(c−3) above.] Further note that H is the
Hamiltonian describing the motion of the binary system
in dilaton gravity.
We may compare our result to scalar-tensor theory
[49].
Scalar-tensor theories (in the so-called Einstein
frame) are based on the same ﬁeld action as dilaton grav-
ity (43). However, the source part (45) is more generic
in scalar-tensor theories,

with the so-called sensitivities α0 and β0. Comparing to
(45) we ﬁnd that α0 = 1 and β0 = 0 for dilaton grav-
ity. The Hamiltonian for scalar-tensor gravity, following
via a Legendre transform from the Lagrangian stated in
Eq. (3.7) of Ref. [49], reads

where ˜G = G(1 + α0˜α0). This Hamiltonian agrees with
ours for α0 = 1 and β0 = 0, as expected. Note that for
α0 = 0 = β0 one obtains the result of general relativity.
In closing let us compare the complexities of establish-
ing the result above with the more traditional approach
of Ref. [49]. At this low order in perturbation theory it
is hard to claim a clear superiority of the double-copy
approach.
We regard our work as a proof of concept,
which we expect to simplify calculations at higher or-
ders dramatically, as it is the case in scattering ampli-
tudes. But already at the next-to-leading order estab-
lished here, our approach allows one to obtain the post-
Minkowskian Feynman integrals in a simple way, where
in a more traditional approach the three-graviton vertex
contains around 170 terms [47].
VI.
CONCLUSIONS
In the present paper, we proposed an adaption of the
BCJ double copy [1–3] to the classical eﬀective action
of binary systems and demonstrated its validity to next-
to-leading order in the weak-ﬁeld/post-Minkowskian ap-
proximation. This is another application for a BCJ-like
double copy beyond (quantum) scattering amplitudes,
next to classical solutions for the ﬁeld equations [19–
21] and weak-ﬁeld approximations for the radiation from
classical binary point-sources [24–26, 28–30].
The for-
mer application of the double copy operates at the level
of the gauge ﬁeld and metric which are gauge-covariant
quantities, unlike gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes.
Similarly, in the present work, we formulated a dou-
ble copy between eﬀective actions, which are not man-
ifestly gauge independent either: the actions depend on
gauge-dependent canonical momenta, and on the dilaton-
gravity side the positions are gauge dependent, too.2
This provides growing evidence that the BCJ double copy
can be adapted to gauge-covariant quantities, which, if
true, would liberate it to a considerably larger realm of
applications.
Furthermore, our work is an adaptation
of the BCJ double copy to classical gravity. This is an
important research direction due to the foreseeable im-
provements of gravitational wave observations over the
2 The (conservative) eﬀective actions encode the binding energy
(energy levels in a quantum mechanical analog), which are gauge
independent.
However, the variables (like momenta) that are
used when the double copy is performed are not gauge invariant.

next decade(s), demanding ever more accurate predic-
tions for the motion and radiation of compact astrophys-
ical binaries.
An improvable part of our double-copy procedure is the
split of worldline vertices with more than one gluon, us-
ing a delta distribution of the worldline parameter. This
leads to singular terms involving δ(0) in the quantum
corrections to the eﬀective action, which we boldly drop
in our classical consideration. While one cannot expect
a consistent treatment of all quantum corrections in an
approach based on classical worldlines, addressing this
problem might still lead to a crucial improvement of our
approach. An interesting solution is to integrate out the
auxiliary ﬁeld ψ along the worldline. Since its propaga-
tor is a step function, the delta distributions used to split
worldline vertices can be produced by derivatives in the
numerators acting on these worldline propagators. This
will avoid the terms δ(0). However, after the double-copy
step, this will produce an auxiliary ﬁeld ψ propagating
along the worldline in the dilaton gravity, too. But it
appears possible to surgically remove this unwanted fea-
ture from the result. Alternatively, one can possibly give
the auxiliary ﬁeld an additional property that one de-
sires of the theory, like a spin. It is interesting to note
that step-function propagators along the worldline basi-
cally introduce a time ordering. This time ordering is
also present in the Wilson loop, which can be used to
calculate the potential between a quark-antiquark pair.
We may also compare our work to a direct calculation
of radiation via equations of motion in [24–26, 30], which
is based on the same classical color charges (Yang-Mills)
and point-masses (dilaton gravity) as our work. If we de-
scend from the eﬀective action to the equations of motion
through a variation, then derivatives of the propagators
may appear. These derivatives are not part of the numer-
ators which take part in the double copy. Adapting the
double copy at the level of equations of motion then faces
the challenge of identifying numerators and (derivatives
of) propagators. This problem was elegantly solved by
Shen [30]: replacing the Yang-Mills numerators by a copy
of the color factor should lead to the corresponding result
in bi-adjoint scalar theory, thus providing a prescription
to separate numerator and propagator structures. Here
we avoided this complication by working at the action
level. On the other hand, it is straightforward to cal-
culate the (gauge independent) radiation emitted by a
binary system when working with equations of motion
[24–26, 30].
While maybe less straightforward, extending our work
to radiation from binaries will be an interesting future
direction. Note that the calculation of classical binary in-
teraction potentials presented here was an eﬀective ﬁeld
theory approach similar to [36]. Following this line of re-
search [51], the calculation of radiation aided by a double
copy (at the level of the action) could succeed. Past work
also suggests that an extension of our work to spinning
point particles [26] or a projection to pure general rela-
tivity [14, 31] will be possible. But the most important
future extension of our present paper will be to demon-
strate the double-copy prescription at higher orders. At
next-to-next-to-leading order in the eﬀective action, the
BCJ color-kinematics duality (Jacobi identity) will start
to play a crucial role in identifying suitable color fac-
tors and numerators for the double copy. As for all work
in the area of color-kinematics duality and double copy,
it will be highly interesting to see if our proposal (or a
modiﬁcation thereof) survives at the next order. For the
original BCJ case, the answer to this was so far always
positive.

double-copy structure, except for the vertex (A8).
Appendix B: Self-interactions in the post-Newtonian
approximation
In
this
appendix,
we
wish
to
discuss
the
self-
interactions, which vanish using the post-Newtonian ex-
pansion of the propagator (77). Using the gauge choice
τ = t, the simplest self-interaction at leading order reads
= −iκ2
2ℏ
Z
dtdt′ [p(t) · p(t′)]2D(x(t) −x(t′))
(B1)
= −iκ2
2ℏ

k2

+ . . .

δ(t −t′).
(B2)
After performing one of the time integrations, the times
are identiﬁed t = t′ and in the end eik·[x(t)−x(t′)] = 1.
The k-integral then turns into a scaleless one and van-
ishes in dimensional regularization.
Hence one gets a
vanishing result at each post-Newtonian order. This re-
sult is physically sensible. Indeed, a crucial property of
the propagator (in Minkowski signature) is that its sup-
port is on the light-cone. Now, the worldlines of mas-
sive particles can not intersect the light cones emanating
from them, so that these self-interaction should be zero.
Similar arguments apply to the other self-interactions at
next-to-leading order in the eﬀective action
,
,
,
which all vanish in dimensional regularization.
