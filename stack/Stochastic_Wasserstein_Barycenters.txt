Optimal Transport
A geometry for probability measures.
Intuition: moving piles of sand.

Wasserstein Distance
The 2-Wasserstein distance between 𝝁1 and 𝝁2 is
Intuition: coupling tells you where to shovel.

Often want to average distributions.

Euclidean averaging doesn’t contain geometric information.

The Wasserstein barycenter of measures 𝝁j is the measure 𝛎 
that minimizes
The standard Euclidean mean is the analog of this.

Why Wasserstein Barycenters?
Barycenters under the Wasserstein distance are more 
intuitive.

Pipeline
Approximate barycenter by a discrete uniform measure:
Solve for positions of the points 𝑥i.
Make use of duality and an alternating optimization scheme.
Only assume sample access to input measures.

Simplifying
Barycenter problem is additive.
Assume that we only have one input measure.
What is the best discrete approximation to a measure?

Kantorovich Dual Problem
The transport problem admits a dual formulation:
Dual problem has a supply/demand interpretation. 

Kantorovich Dual Problem
Can simplify when one measure is discrete:
weights
Voronoi regions

Optimization -- Weights
The dual problem is concave in the weights.
Can apply gradient ascent with gradient:
density of cell

Optimization -- Points
The dual is non-convex in the point positions.
Gradient yields a simple fixed point iteration scheme.
barycenter of cell

Map a continuous distribution to a discrete one.
 Semidiscrete Problem

Optimization -- Weights
Adjust weights

Optimization -- Points
Adjust weights
Move points

Algorithm
Extension to barycenter as simple as summing gradients.
●Sample seed points for the barycenter.
●Repeat until converged:
1. Solve for weights via gradient ascent.
2. Shift points via fixed point iteration.
