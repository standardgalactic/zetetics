TO THE MEMORY OF J¨URGEN MOSER
(1928–1999)

Preface
Daß ich erkenne, was die Welt im Innersten zusammenh¨alt.1
Faust
Concepts without intuition are empty, intuition without concepts is blind.
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)
The greatest mathematicians like Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss have
always been able to combine theory and applications into one.
Felix Klein (1849–1925)
The present comprehensive introduction to the mathematical and physical
aspects of quantum ﬁeld theory consists of the following six volumes:
Volume I: Basics in Mathematics and Physics
Volume II: Quantum Electrodynamics
Volume III: Gauge Theory
Volume IV: Quantum Mathematics
Volume V: The Physics of the Standard Model
Volume VI: Quantum Gravity and String Theory.
Since ancient times, both physicists and mathematicians have tried to under-
stand the forces acting in nature. Nowadays we know that there exist four
fundamental forces in nature:
• Newton’s gravitational force,
• Maxwell’s electromagnetic force,
• the strong force between elementary particles, and
• the weak force between elementary particles (e.g., the force responsible for
the radioactive decay of atoms).
In the 20th century, physicists established two basic models, namely,
• the Standard Model in cosmology based on Einstein’s theory of general
relativity, and
• the Standard Model in elementary particle physics based on gauge theory.
1 So that I may perceive whatever holds the world together in its inmost folds.
The alchemist Georg Faust (1480–1540) is the protagonist of Goethe’s drama
Faust written in 1808.

Preface
One of the greatest challenges of the human intellect is the discovery of
a uniﬁed theory for the four fundamental forces in nature based on ﬁrst
principles in physics and rigorous mathematics. For many years, I have been
fascinated by this challenge. When talking about this challenge to colleagues,
I have noticed that many of my colleagues in mathematics complain about the
fact that it is diﬃcult to understand the thinking of physicists and to follow
the pragmatic, but frequently non-rigorous arguments used by physicists. On
the other hand, my colleagues in physics complain about the abstract level
of the modern mathematical literature and the lack of explicitly formulated
connections to physics. This has motivated me to write the present book and
the volumes to follow.
It is my intention to build a bridge between mathematicians and
physicists.
The main ideas of this treatise are described in the Prologue to this book.
The six volumes address a broad audience of readers, including both under-
graduate students and graduate students as well as experienced scientists
who want to become familiar with the mathematical and physical aspects of
the fascinating ﬁeld of quantum ﬁeld theory. In some sense, we will start from
scratch:
• For students of mathematics, I would like to show that detailed knowledge
of the physical background helps to motivate the mathematical subjects
and to discover interesting interrelationships between quite diﬀerent math-
ematical questions.
• For students of physics, I would like to introduce fairly advanced mathe-
matics which is beyond the usual curriculum in physics.
For historical reasons, there exists a gap between the language of mathemati-
cians and the language of physicists. I want to bridge this gap.2 I will try to
minimize the preliminaries such that undergraduate students after two years
of studies should be able to understand the main body of the text. In writing
this monograph, it was my goal to follow the advise given by the poet Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832):
Textbooks should be attractive by showing the beauty of the subject.
Ariadne’s thread. In the author’s opinion, the most important prelude
to learning a new subject is strong motivation. Experience shows that highly
motivated students are willing to take great eﬀort to learn sophisticated sub-
jects.
I would like to put the beginning of Ariadne’s thread into the hands
of the reader.
2 On November 7th 1940, there was a famous accident in the U.S.A. which was
recorded on ﬁlm. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge broke down because of unexpected
nonlinear resonance eﬀects. I hope that my bridge between mathematicians and
physicists is not of Tacoma type.

Preface
IX
Remember the following myth. On the Greek island of Crete in ancient times,
there lived the monster Minotaur, half human and half bull, in a labyrinth.
Every nine years, seven virgins and seven young men had to be sacriﬁced to
the Minotaur. Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete and Pasipha¨e
fell in love with one of the seven young men – the Athenian Prince Theseus.
To save his life, Ariadne gave Theseus a thread of yarn, and he ﬁxed the
beginning of the thread at the entrance of the labyrinth. After a hard ﬁght,
Theseus killed the Minotaur, and he escaped from the labyrinth by the help
of Ariadne’s thread.3 For hard scientiﬁc work, it is nice to have a kind of
Ariadne’s thread at hand. The six volumes cover a fairly broad spectrum of
mathematics and physics. In particular, in the present ﬁrst volume the reader
gets information about
• the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics and
• the magic formulas in quantum ﬁeld theory,
and we touch the following mathematical subjects:
• ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and a rigorous approach to the basic ideas
of quantum ﬁeld theory,
• elements of functional diﬀerentiation and functional integration,
• elements of probability theory,
• calculus of variations and the principle of critical action,
• harmonic analysis and the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, and
the Mellin transform,
• Green’s functions, partial diﬀerential equations, and distributions (gener-
alized functions),
• Green’s functions, the Fourier method, and functional integrals (path in-
tegrals),
• the Lebesgue integral, general measure integrals, and Hilbert spaces,
• elements of functional analysis and perturbation theory,
• the Dirichlet principle as a paradigm for the modern Hilbert space approach
to partial diﬀerential equations,
• spectral theory and rigorous Dirac calculus,
• analyticity,
• calculus for Grassmann variables,
• many-particle systems and number theory,
• Lie groups and Lie algebras,
• basic ideas of diﬀerential and algebraic topology (homology, cohomology,
and homotopy; topological quantum numbers and quantum states).
We want to show the reader that many mathematical methods used in quan-
tum ﬁeld theory can be traced back to classical mathematical problems. In
3 Unfortunately, Theseus was not grateful to Ariadne. He deserted her on the Is-
land of Naxos, and she became the bride of Dionysus. Richard Strauss composed
the opera Ariadne on Naxos in 1912.

Preface
particular, we will thoroughly study the relation of the procedure of renor-
malization in physics to the following classical mathematical topics:
• singular perturbations, resonances, and bifurcation in oscillating systems
(renormalization in a nutshell on page 625),
• the regularization of divergent inﬁnite series, divergent inﬁnite products,
and divergent integrals,
• divergent integrals and distributions (Hadamard’s ﬁnite part of divergent
integrals),
• the passage from a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom to an inﬁnite number
of degrees of freedom and the method of counterterms in complex analysis
(the Weierstrass theorem and the Mittag–Leﬄer theorem),
• analytic continuation and the zeta function in number theory,
• Poincar´e’s asymptotic series and the Ritt theorem in complex analysis,
• the renormalization group and Lie’s theory of dynamical systems (one-
parameter Lie groups),
• rigorous theory of ﬁnite-dimensional functional integrals (path integrals).
The following volumes will provide the reader with important additional ma-
terial. A summary can be found in the Prologue on pages 11 through 15.
Additional material on the Internet. The interested reader may ﬁnd
additional material on my homepage:
Internet: www.mis.mpg.de/ezeidler/
This concerns a carefully structured panorama of important literature in
mathematics, physics, history of the sciences and philosophy, along with a
comprehensive bibliography. One may also ﬁnd a comprehensive list of math-
ematicians, physicists, and philosophers (from ancient until present time)
mentioned in the six volumes. My homepage also allows links to the lead-
ing centers in elementary particle physics: CERN (Geneva, Switzerland),
DESY (Hamburg, Germany), FERMILAB (Batavia, Illinois, U.S.A.), KEK
(Tsukuba, Japan), and SLAC (Stanford University, California, U.S.A.). One
may also ﬁnd links to the following Max Planck Institutes in Germany: As-
tronomy (Heidelberg), Astrophysics (Garching), Complex Systems in Physics
(Dresden), Albert Einstein Institute for Gravitational Physics (Golm), Math-
ematics (Bonn), Nuclear Physics (Heidelberg), Werner Heisenberg Institute
for Physics (Munich), and Plasmaphysics (Garching).
Apology. The author apologizes for his imperfect English style. In the
preface to his monograph The Classical Groups, Princeton University Press,
1946, Hermann Weyl writes the following:
The gods have imposed upon my writing the yoke of a foreign tongue that
was not sung at my cradle.
“Was das heissen will, weiss jeder,
Der im Traum pferdlos geritten ist,”4
4 Everyone who has dreamt of riding free, without the need of a horse, will know
what I mean.

I am tempted to say with the Swiss poet Gottfried Keller (1819–1890).
Nobody is more aware than myself of the attendant loss in vigor, ease and
lucidity of expression.
Acknowledgements. First of all I would like to thank the Max Planck So-
ciety in Germany for founding the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics
in the Sciences (MIS) in Leipzig in 1996 and for creating a superb scientiﬁc

Prologue
We begin with some quotations which exemplify the philosophical underpin-
nings of this work.
Theoria cum praxi.
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716)
It is very diﬃcult to write mathematics books today. If one does not take
pains with the ﬁne points of theorems, explanations, proofs and corollaries,
then it won’t be a mathematics book; but if one does these things, then
the reading of it will be extremely boring.
Johannes Kepler (1571–1630)
Astronomia Nova
The interaction between physics and mathematics has always played an
important role. The physicist who does not have the latest mathemati-
cal knowledge available to him is at a distinct disadvantage. The mathe-
matician who shies away from physical applications will most likely miss
important insights and motivations.
Marvin Schechter
Operator Methods in Quantum Mechanics5
In 1967 Lenard and I found a proof of the stability of matter. Our proof was
so complicated and so unilluminating that it stimulated Lieb and Thirring
to ﬁnd the ﬁrst decent proof. Why was our proof so bad and why was
theirs so good? The reason is simple. Lenard and I began with mathe-
matical tricks and hacked our way through a forest of inequalities without
any physical understanding. Lieb and Thirring began with physical under-
standing and went on to ﬁnd the appropriate mathematical language to
make their understanding rigorous. Our proof was a dead end. Theirs was
a gateway to the new world of ideas collected in this book.

Prologue
works at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.7 He characterizes
the state of the art in quantum ﬁeld theory in the following way:
All through its history, quantum ﬁeld theory has had two faces, one looking
outward, the other looking inward. The outward face looks at nature and
gives us numbers that we can calculate and compare with experiments.
The inward face looks at mathematical concepts and searches for a con-
sistent foundation on which to build the theory. The outward face shows
us brilliantly successful theory, bringing order to the chaos of particle in-
teractions, predicting experimental results with astonishing precision. The
inward face shows us a deep mystery. After seventy years of searching, we
have found no consistent mathematical basis for the theory. When we try
to impose the rigorous standards of pure mathematics, the theory becomes
undeﬁned or inconsistent. From the point of view of a pure mathematician,
the theory does not exist. This is the great unsolved paradox of quantum
ﬁeld theory.
To resolve the paradox, during the last twenty years, quantum ﬁeld theo-
rists have become string-theorists. String theory is a new version of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, exploring the mathematical foundations more deeply and
entering a new world of multidimensional geometry. String theory also
brings gravitation into the picture, and thereby uniﬁes quantum ﬁeld the-
ory with general relativity. String theory has already led to important
advances in pure mathematics. It has not led to any physical predictions
that can be tested by experiment. We do not know whether string theory
is a true description of nature. All we know is that it is a rich treasure
of new mathematics, with an enticing promise of new physics. During the
coming century, string theory will be intensively developed, and, if we are
lucky, tested by experiment.8
Five golden rules. When writing the latex ﬁle of this book on my com-
puter, I had in mind the following ﬁve quotations. Let me start with the
mathematician Hermann Weyl (1885–1930) who became a follower of Hilbert
in G¨ottingen in 1930 and who left Germany in 1933 when the Nazi regime
came to power. Together with Albert Einstein (1879–1955) and John von
Neumann (1903–1957), Weyl became a member of the newly founded Insti-
tute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A. in 1933. Hermann
Weyl wrote in 1938:9
The stringent precision attainable for mathematical thought has led many
authors to a mode of writing which must give the reader an impression
of being shut up in a brightly illuminated cell where every detail sticks
out with the same dazzling clarity, but without relief. I prefer the open
landscape under a clear sky with its depth of perspective, where the wealth
of sharply deﬁned nearby details gradually fades away towards the horizon.

For his fundamental contributions to electroweak interaction inside the Stan-
dard Model in particle physics, the physicist Steven Weinberg (born 1933) was
awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1979 together with Sheldon Glashow
(born 1932) and Abdus Salam (1926–1996). On the occasion of a conference
on the interrelations between mathematics and physics in 1986, Weinberg
pointed out the following: 10
I am not able to learn any mathematics unless I can see some problem I am
going to solve with mathematics, and I don’t understand how anyone can
teach mathematics without having a battery of problems that the student
is going to be inspired to want to solve and then see that he or she can
use the tools for solving them.
For his theoretical investigations on parity violation under weak interaction,
the physicist Cheng Ning Yang (born 1922) was awarded the Nobel prize in
physics in 1957 together with Tsung Dao Lee (born 1926). In an interview,
Yang remarked:11
In 1983 I gave a talk on physics in Seoul, South Korea. I joked “There
exist only two kinds of modern mathematics books: one which you cannot
read beyond the ﬁrst page and one which you cannot read beyond the ﬁrst
sentence. The Mathematical Intelligencer later reprinted this joke of mine.
But I suspect many mathematicians themselves agree with me.
The interrelations between mathematics and modern physics have been pro-
moted by Sir Michael Atiyah (born 1929) on a very deep level. In 1966, the
young Atiyah was awarded the Fields medal. In an interview, Atiyah empha-
sized the following: 12
The more I have learned about physics, the more convinced I am that
physics provides, in a sense, the deepest applications of mathematics. The
mathematical problems that have been solved, or techniques that have
arisen out of physics in the past, have been the lifeblood of mathematics. . .
The really deep questions are still in the physical sciences. For the health of
mathematics at its research level, I think it is very important to maintain
that link as much as possible.
The development of modern quantum ﬁeld theory has been strongly inﬂu-
enced by the pioneering ideas of the physicist Richard Feynman (1918–1988).
In 1965, for his contributions to the foundation of quantum electrodynam-
ics, Feynman was awarded the Nobel prize in physics together with Julian
Schwinger (1918–1994) and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (1906–1979). In the begin-
ning of the 1960s, Feynman held his famous Feynman lectures at the Califor-
nia Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In the preface to the printed version
of the lectures, Feynman told his students the following:
Finally, may I add that the main purpose of my teaching has not been
to prepare you for some examination – it was not even to prepare you to

serve industry or military. I wanted most to give you some appreciation
of the wonderful world and the physicist’s way of looking at it, which, I
believe, is a major part of the true culture of modern times.13
The fascination of quantum ﬁeld theory. As a typical example, let
us consider the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. This is given by
the following formula
Me = −e
2me
geS
with the so-called gyromagnetic factor
ge = 2(1 + a)
of the electron. Here, me is the mass of the electron, −e is the negative electric
charge of the electron. The spin vector S has the length ℏ/2, where h denotes

the value
aexp = 0.001 159 652 188 4 ± 0.000 000 000 004 3.
Quantum electrodynamics is able to predict this result with high accuracy.

The error is due to the uncertainty of the electromagnetic ﬁne structure
constant α. Observe that 9 digits coincide between the experimental value
aexp and the theoretical value a.
The theoretical result (0.1) represents a highlight in modern theoretical
physics. The single terms with respect to powers of the ﬁne structure constant
α have been obtained by using the method of perturbation theory. In order
to represent graphically the single terms appearing in perturbation theory,
Richard Feynman (1918–1988) invented the language of Feynman diagrams
in about 1945.14 For example, Fig. 0.1 shows some simple Feynman diagrams

for the Compton scattering between electrons and photons. In higher order of
perturbation theory, the Feynman diagrams become more and more complex.
In particular, in order to get the α3-term of (0.1), one has to use 72 Feynman
diagrams. The computation of the α3-term has taken 20 years. The α4-term
from (0.1) is based on 891 Feynman diagrams. The computation has been
done mainly by numerical approximation methods. This needed years of su-
percomputer time.15 The mathematical situation becomes horrible because
of the following fact.
Many of the Feynman diagrams correspond to divergent higher-
dimensional integrals called algebraic Feynman integrals.
Physicists invented the ingenious method of renormalization in order to give
the apparently meaningless integrals a precise interpretation. Renormaliza-
tion plays a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory. Physicists do not
expect that the perturbation series (0.1) is part of a convergent power series
expansion with respect to the variable α at the origin. Suppose that there
would exist such a convergent power series expansion

|α| ≤α0
near the origin α = 0. This series would then converge for small negative
values of α. However, such a negative coupling constant would correspond to
a repelling force which destroys the system. This argument is due to Dyson.16
Therefore, we do not expect that the series (0.1) is convergent.
In Sect. 15.5.2, we will show that each formal power series expansion is indeed
the asymptotic expansion of some analytic function in an angular domain,
by the famous 1916 Ritt theorem in mathematics.

Prologue
From the mathematical point of view, the best approach to renormaliza-
tion was created by Epstein and Glaser in 1973. The Epstein–Glaser theory
avoids the use of divergent integrals and their regularization, but relies on
the power of the modern theory of distributions (generalized functions).
Physicists have also computed the magnetic moment of the myon. As
for the electron, the coincidence between theory and experiment is of fan-
tastic accuracy. Here, the theory takes all of the contributions coming from
electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitative interaction into account.17
It is a challenge for the mathematics of the future to completely un-
derstand formula (0.1).
Let us now brieﬂy discuss the content of Volumes I through VI of this mono-
graph.

In particular, the heuristic magic formulas from Part III should help the
reader to understand quickly the language of physicists in quantum ﬁeld
theory. These magic formulas are non-rigorous from the mathematical point
of view, but they are extremely useful for computing physical eﬀects.
Modern elementary particle physics is based on the Standard Model in
particle physics introduced in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Before
studying thoroughly the Standard Model in the next volumes, we will discuss
the phenomenology of this model in the present volume. It is the goal of
quantum ﬁeld theory to compute
• the cross sections of scattering processes in particle accelerators which char-
acterize the behavior of the scattered particles,
• the masses of stable elementary particles (e.g., the proton mass as a bound
state of three quarks), and
• the lifetime of unstable elementary particles in particle accelerators.
To this end, physicists use the methods of perturbation theory. Fortunately
enough, the computations can be based on only a few basic formulas which
we call magic formulas. The magic formulas of quantum theory are extremely
useful for describing the experimental data observed in particle accelerators,
but they are only valid on a quite formal level.
This diﬃculty is typical for present quantum ﬁeld theory.
To help the reader in understanding the formal approach used in physics, we
consider the ﬁnite-dimensional situation in Chapter 6.
In the ﬁnite-dimensional case, we will rigorously prove all of the
magic formulas used by physicists in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Furthermore, we relate physics to the following ﬁelds of mathematics:
• causality and the analyticity of complex-valued functions,
• many-particle systems, the Casimir eﬀect in quantum ﬁeld theory, and
number theory,
• propagation of physical eﬀects, distributions (generalized functions), and
the Green’s function,
• rigorous justiﬁcation of the elegant Dirac calculus,
• duality in physics (time and energy, time and frequency, position and mo-
mentum) and harmonic analysis (Fourier series, Fourier transformation,
Laplace transformation, Mellin transformation, von Neumann’s general op-
erator calculus for self-adjoint operators, Gelfand triplets and generalized
eigenfunctions),
• the relation between renormalization, resonances, and bifurcation,
• dynamical systems, Lie groups, and the renormalization group,
• fundamental limits in physics,
• topology in physics (Chern numbers and topological quantum numbers),
• probability, Brownian motion, and the Wiener integral,

In fact, this covers a broad range of physical and mathematical subjects.

The ﬁnal goal of quantum ﬁeld theory is the foundation of a rigorous math-
ematical theory which contains the Standard Model as a special low-energy
approximation. At present we are far away from reaching this ﬁnal goal. From
the physical point of view, the most successful quantum ﬁeld theory is quan-
tum electrodynamics. This will be studied in Volume II along with some

Prologue

applications to important physical processes like Compton scattering be-
tween electrons and photons, the spontaneous emission of light by molecules,
Cherenkov radiation of fast electrons, the Lamb shift in the hydrogen spec-
trum, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, and the Hawking
radiation of black holes. We also study the physics and mathematics behind
the crucial phenomenon of renormalization and the change of scales in physics
culminating in the modern theory of the renormalization group. Generally, we
try to include both interesting mathematics and interesting physics. In partic-
ular, we will discuss the relation of renormalization in physics to the following
mathematical subjects: Euler’s gamma function, the Riemann–Liouville in-
tegral, and dimensional regularization; Borel summation of divergent series;
pseudo-convergence of iterative methods for ill-posed problems, Hopf alge-
bras and Rota–Baxter algebras; theory of categories; wave front sets and the
theory of distributions, Euler’s and Feynman’s mathemagics.
Volume III. The fundamental forces in the universe are described
by gauge ﬁeld theories which generalize both Gauss’ surface theory and
Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. The third volume entitled Gauge The-
ories is divided into the following parts.

Interestingly enough, it turns out that the Standard Model in particle physics
is related to many deep questions in both mathematics and physics. We will
see that the question about the structure of the fundamental forces in nature
has inﬂuenced implicitly or explicitly the development of a large part of
mathematics. One of our heros will be Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855),
one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. We will encounter his highly
inﬂuential work again and again. In the German Museum in Munich, one can
read the following inscription under Gauss’ impressive portrait:

10
Prologue
His spirit lifted the deepest secrets of numbers, space, and nature; he mea-
sured the orbits of the planets, the form and the forces of the earth; in his
mind he carried the mathematical science of a coming century.
On the occasion of Gauss’ death, Sartorius von Waltershausen wrote the
following in 1855:
From time to time in the past, certain brilliant, unusually gifted person-
alities have arisen from their environment, who by virtue of the creative
power of their thoughts and the energy of their actions have had such an
overall positive inﬂuence on the intellectual development of mankind, that
they at the same time stand tall as markers between the centuries. . . Such
epoch-making mental giants in the history of mathematics and the natural
sciences are Archimedes of Syracuse in ancient times, Newton toward the
end of the dark ages and Gauss in our present day, whose shining, glorious
career has come to an end after the cold hand of death touched his at one
time deeply-thinking head on February 23 of this year.
Another hero will be Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) – a pupil of Gauss.
Riemann’s legacy inﬂuenced strongly mathematics and physics of the 20th
century, as we will show in this treatise.18
The two Standard Models in modern physics concerning cosmology and
elementary particles are closely related to modern diﬀerential geometry. This
will be thoroughly studied in Volume III. We will show that both Einstein’s
general theory of relativity and the Standard Model in particle physics are
gauge theories. From the mathematical point of view, the fundamental forces
in nature are curvatures of appropriate ﬁber bundles. Historically, math-
ematicians have tried to understand the curvature of geometric objects. At
the very beginning, there was Gauss’ theorema egregium19 telling us that cur-
vature is an intrinsic property of a surface. On the other side, in the history
of physics, physicists have tried to understand the forces in nature. Nowadays
we know that both mathematicians and physicists have approached the same
goal coming from diﬀerent sides. We can summarize this by saying brieﬂy
that
force = curvature.
For the convenience of the reader, we will also discuss in Volume II that many
of the mathematical concepts arising in quantum ﬁeld theory are rooted in the
geometry of the Euclidean space (e.g., Lie groups and Lie algebras, operator
algebras, Grassmann algebras, Cliﬀord algebras, diﬀerential forms and coho-
mology, Hodge duality, projective structures, symplectic structures, contact
structures, conformal structures, Riemann surfaces, and supersymmetry).
Volume IV. Quantum physics diﬀers from classical relativistic ﬁeld the-
ories by adding the process of quantization. From the physical point of view,
18 We also recommend the beautiful monograph written by Krzysztof Maurin, Rie-
mann’s Legacy, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1997.
19 The Latin expression theorema egregium means the beautiful theorem.

there appear additional quantum eﬀects based on random quantum ﬂuctu-
ations. From the mathematical point of view, one has to deform classical
theories in an appropriate way. Volume IV is devoted to the mathematical
and physical methods of quantization. For this, we coin the term Quantum
Mathematics. Volume IV represents the ﬁrst systematic textbook on Quan-
tum Mathematics. This volume will be divided into the following parts.

try.

• Chapter 16: Progress in Mathematics by Using Ideas Originated in
Quantum Physics
• Chapter 17: Mathematics – a Cosmic Eye of Humanity.
Typically, quantum ﬁelds are interacting physical systems with an inﬁnite
number of degrees of freedom and very strong singularities. In mathematics,
• interactions lead to nonlinear terms, and
• inﬁnite-dimensional systems are described in terms of functional analysis.
Therefore, the right mathematical setting for quantum ﬁeld theory is nonlin-
ear functional analysis. This branch of mathematics has been very successful
in the rigorous treatment of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations concern-
ing elasticity and plasticity theory, hydrodynamics, and the theory of general
relativity. But the actual state of the art of nonlinear functional analysis
does not yet allow for the rigorous investigation of realistic models in quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, like the Standard Model in particle physics. Physicists say,
we cannot wait until mathematics is ready. Therefore, we have to develop our

12
Prologue
own non-rigorous methods, and we have to check the success of our methods
by comparing them with experimental data. In order to help mathematicians
to enter the world of physicists, we will proceed as follows.
(i) Rigorous methods: We ﬁrst develop quantum mathematics in ﬁnite-
dimensional spaces. In this case, we can use rigorous methods based on
the theory of Hilbert spaces, operator algebras, and discrete functional
integrals.
(ii) Formal methods. The formulas from (i) can be generalized in a straight-
forward, but formal way to inﬁnite-dimensional systems.
This way, the mathematician should learn where the formulas of the physicists
come from and how to handle these formulas in order to compute physical
eﬀects. What remains is to solve the open problem of rigorous justiﬁcation.
The point will be the investigation of limits and pseudo-limits if the
number of particles goes to inﬁnity.
By a pseudo-limit, we understand the extraction of maximal information
from an ill-deﬁned object, as in the method of renormalization. The experi-
ence of physicists and mathematicians shows that we cannot expect the limits
or pseudo-limits to exist for all possible quantities. The rule of thumb is as
follows: concentrate on quantities which can be measured in physical experi-
ments. This seriously complicates the subject. We will frequently encounter
the Feynman functional integral. From the mnemonic point of view, this is
a marvellous tool. But it lacks mathematical rigor. We will follow the advise
given by Evariste Galois (1811–1832):
Unfortunately what is little recognized is that the most worthwhile scien-
tiﬁc books are those in which the author clearly indicates what he does
not know; for an author most hurts his readers by concealing diﬃculties.
Volume V. The mathematician should notice that it is the ultimate goal
of a physicist to compute real numbers which can be measured in physical
experiments. For reaching this goal, the physicist mixes rigorous arguments
with heuristic ones in an ingenious way. In order to make mathematicians
familiar with this method of doing science, in Volume V we will study the
physics of the Standard Model in particle physics. In particular, we will show
how to compute a number of physical eﬀects. In this respect, symmetries will
play an important role. For example, this will concern the representation the-
ory of compact Lie groups (e.g., gauge groups in gauge theory), noncompact
Lie groups (the Poincar´e group and its universal covering group in relativis-
tic physics), inﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebras (e.g., the Virasoro algebra in
string theory), and supersymmetric generalizations.
Volume VI. The last volume will be devoted to combining the Standard
Model in particle physics with gravitation. We will study several possible
approaches to this fascinating, but still completely open problem. The leading
candidate is string theory. In connection with the string theory of physicists,

Prologue
13
a completely new way of thinking has emerged which we will call physical
mathematics, a term already used in Kishore Marathe’s nice survey article
on the role of knot theory in modern mathematics, physics, and biology.20
Distinguish the following:
• By mathematical physics, we traditionally understand a branch of mathe-
matics which answers questions coming from physics by applying rigorous
mathematical methods. The heart of mathematical physics are mathemat-
ical proofs (e.g., existence proofs for solutions of partial diﬀerential equa-
tions or operator equations).
• By physical mathematics, we understand a branch of physics which is mo-
tivated by the question about the fundamental forces in nature. Using
physical pictures, physicists are able to conjecture deep mathematical re-
sults (e.g., the existence and the properties of new topological invariants
for manifolds and knots). The heart of physical mathematics is physical
intuition, but not the mathematical proof.
The hero of physical mathematics is the physicist Edward Witten (born 1951)
from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. At the International
Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto (Japan) in 1990, Witten was awarded
the Fields medal. In the last 15 years, physical mathematics was very suc-
cessful in feeding fascinating new ideas into mathematics. The main method
of physical mathematics goes like this:
• start with a model in quantum ﬁeld theory based on an appropriate La-
grangian;
• quantize this model by means of the corresponding Feynman functional
integral;
• extract essential information from the functional integral by using the
method of stationary phase.
The point is that this method yields beautiful mathematical conjectures, but
it is not able to give rigorous proofs. Unfortunately, for getting proofs, math-
ematicians have to follow quite diﬀerent sophisticated routes. It is a challenge
to mathematicians to understand better the magic weapon of physical math-
ematics.
The magic weapon of physical mathematics will be called the Witten
functor. This functor translates physical structures into mathematical
structures.
With respect to the Witten functor, one observes the following general evo-
lution principle in mathematics.

Prologue
(i) From quantity to quality: In the 1920s, modern algebra was founded by
passing from concrete mathematical objects like numbers to abstract
mathematical structures like groups, rings, ﬁelds, and algebras. Here, one
only considers the relations between the objects, but not the individual
structure of the objects. For example, Emmy Noether emphasized in the
1920s that, in the setting of algebraic topology created by Poincar´e at the
end of the 19th century, it is very useful to pass from Betti numbers to
homology groups. In turn, it was discovered in the 1930s that cohomology
groups are in fact richer in structure than homology groups. The point is
that cohomology groups possess a natural multiplicative structure which
generates the cohomology ring of topological spaces. For example, the
product S2×S4 of a 2-dimensional sphere with a 4-dimensional sphere has
the same homology and cohomology groups as the 3-dimensional complex
projective space P3
C. However, these two manifolds are not topologically
equivalent, since their cohomology rings are diﬀerent.
(ii) Combining abstract structures with each other: For example, Lie groups
are obtained by combining the notion of manifold with the notion of
group. In turn, ﬁber bundles occur by combining manifolds with Lie
groups.
(iii) Functors between abstract structures: In the late 1940s, the theory of
categories emerged in the context of algebraic topology. For example, the
Galois functor simpliﬁes the study of ﬁeld extensions by mapping ﬁelds
to groups. The Lie functor simpliﬁes the investigation of Lie groups by
mapping Lie groups to Lie algebras. Moreover, the homology functor sim-
pliﬁes the structural analysis of topological spaces (geometric objects) by
mapping topological spaces to groups called homology groups. Combin-
ing the homology functor with the general concept of duality, we arrive
at the cohomology functor which maps topological spaces to cohomology
groups. Cohomology plays a fundamental role in modern physics.
(iv) Statistics of abstract structures: In physical mathematics, one considers
the statistics of physical states in terms of functional integrals. The point
is that the states are equivalence classes of mathematical structures. In
the language of mathematics, the physical state spaces are moduli spaces.
For example, in string theory the states of strings are Riemann surfaces
modulo conformal equivalence. Thus, the state space of all those strings
which possess a ﬁxed genus g is nothing other than Riemann’s famous
moduli space Mg which can be described by a universal covering space
of Mg called the Teichm¨uller space Tg. Mathematicians know that the
theory of moduli spaces is a challenge in algebraic geometry, since such
objects carry singularities, as a rule. Physicists expect that those singu-
larities are responsible for essential physical eﬀects.
Another typical feature of physical mathematics is the description of many-
particle systems by partition functions which encode essential information.
As we will show, the Feynman functional integral is nothing other than a

Prologue
15
partition function which encodes the essential properties of quantum ﬁelds.
From the physical point of view, the Riemann zeta function is a partition
function for the inﬁnite system of prime numbers. The notion of partition
function uniﬁes
• statistical physics,
• quantum mechanics,
• quantum ﬁeld theory, and
• number theory.
Summarizing, I dare say that
The most important notion of modern physics is the Feynman func-
tional integral as a partition function for the states of many-particle
systems.
It is a challenge of mathematics to understand this notion in a better way
than known today.
A panorama of mathematics. For the investigation of problems in
quantum ﬁeld theory, we need a broad spectrum of mathematical branches.
This concerns
(a) algebra, algebraic geometry, and number theory,
(b) analysis and functional analysis,
(c) geometry and topology,
(d) information theory, theory of probability, and stochastic processes,
(e) scientiﬁc computing.
In particular, we will deal with the following subjects:
• Lie groups and symmetry, Lie algebras, Kac–Moody algebras (gauge groups,
permutation groups, the Poincar´e group in relativistic physics, conformal
symmetry),
• graded Lie algebras (supersymmetry between bosons and fermions),
• calculus of variations and partial diﬀerential equations (the principle of
critical action),

tum ﬁeld theory via the S-matrix),

transformations, Poisson structures, Finsler geometry),

theory of general relativity, Hilbert space geometry and quantum states,

tion quantization, stochastic quantization, the Riemann–Hilbert problem,

relman theory, homology, cohomology, homotopy, characteristic classes, ho-
mological algebra, K-theory),

classes, and Chern numbers, Morse numbers, Floer homology),
• the Riemann–Roch–Hirzebruch theorem and the Atiyah–Singer index the-
orem,
• analytic continuation, functions of several complex variables (sheaf theory),
• string theory, conformal symmetry, moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces,
and K¨ahler manifolds.
The role of proofs. Mathematics relies on proofs based on perfect logic.
The reader should note that, in this treatise, the terms
• proposition,
• theorem (important proposition), and
• proof
are used in the rigorous sense of mathematics. In addition, for helping the
reader in understanding the basic ideas, we also use ‘motivations’, ‘formal
proofs’, ‘heuristic arguments’ and so on, which emphasize intuition, but lack
rigor. Because of the rich material to be studied, it is impossible to provide
the reader with full proofs for all the diﬀerent subjects. However, for missing

17
proofs we add references to carefully selected sources. Many of the missing
proofs can be found in the following monographs:
• E. Zeidler, Applied Functional Analysis, Vols. 1, 2, Springer, New York. 1995.
• E. Zeidler, Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications, Vols. 1–4, Sprin-

For getting an overview, the reader should also consult the following book:21

At the end of the Oxford Users’ Guide to Mathematics, the interested reader
may ﬁnd a chronology of mathematics and physics from ancient to present
times embedded in the cultural history of mankind.
Perspectives. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris
in 1900, Hilbert formulated 23 open problems for the mathematics of the
20th century. Many of them have been solved.22 Hilbert said the following to
the audience in 1900:
Each progress in mathematics is based on the discovery of stronger tools
and easier methods, which at the same time makes it easier to understand
earlier methods. By making these stronger tools and easier methods his
own, it is possible for the individual researcher to orientate himself in the
diﬀerent branches of mathematics. . .
When the answer to a mathematical problem cannot be found, then the
reason is frequently that we have not recognized the general idea from
which the given problem only appears as a link in a chain of related prob-
lems. . .
The organic unity of mathematics is inherent in the nature of this sci-
ence, for mathematics is the foundation of all exact knowledge of natural
phenomena.
For the 21th century, the open problem of quantum ﬁeld theory represents a
great challenge. It is completely unclear how long the solution of this prob-
lem will take. In fact, there are long-term problems in mathematics. As an
example, let us consider Fermat’s Last Theorem where the solution needed
more than 350 years. In ancient times, Pythagoras (508–500 B.C.) knew that
the equation
x2 + y2 = z2
has an inﬁnite number of integer solutions (e.g., x = 3, y = 4, z = 5). In 1637,
Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665), claimed that the equation
xn + yn = zn,
n = 3, 4, . . .

has no nontrivial integer solution. In his copy of the Arithmetica by Diophan-
tus (250 A.C.), Fermat wrote the following:
It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a biquadrate into
two biquadrates, or generally any power except a square into two powers
with the same exponent. I have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this,
which however the margin is not large enough to contain.
The history of this problem can be found in the bestseller by Simon Singh,
Fermat’s Last Theorem: The Story of a Riddle that Confounded the World’s
Greatest Minds for 358 Years, Fourth Estate, London, 1997. The ﬁnal proof
was given by Andrew Wiles (born 1953) in Princeton in 1994.23 The proof,
based on the Galois functor, is of extraordinary complexity, and it uses many
sophisticated tools from number theory and algebraic geometry developed
in the 19th and 20th century. However, in the sense of Hilbert’s philosophy
for hard problems quoted above, let us describe the basic idea behind the
solution. In this connection, it turns out that there is a beautiful geometric
result of general interest behind Fermat’s Last Theorem.24 The fundamental
geometric result tells us that25
(M) Each elliptic curve is modular.
Roughly speaking, the proof of Fermat’s last theorem proceeds now like this:
(i) Suppose that Fermat’s claim is wrong. Then, there exists a nontrivial
triplet x, y, z of integers such that xn + yn = zn for some ﬁxed natural
number n ≥3.
(ii) The triplet x, y, z can be used in order to construct a speciﬁc elliptic
curve (the Frey curve), which is not modular, a contradiction to (M).
It remains to sketch the meaning of the geometric principle (M). To begin
with, consider the equation of the complex unit circle
x2 + y2 = 1
where x and y are complex parameters. The unit circle allows a parametriza-
tion either by periodic functions,
x = cos ϕ,
y = sin ϕ,
ϕ ∈C,
or by rational functions,

2 . Recall that each compact Riemann surface
of genus zero is conformally and topologically equivalent to the real two-
dimensional sphere called the Riemann sphere. In particular, the complex
unit circle considered above is such a Riemann surface of genus zero. More-
over, compact Riemann surfaces of genus one are conformally and topologi-
cally equivalent to some real two-dimensional torus. Such Riemann surfaces
are also called elliptic curves. For example, given three pairwise diﬀerent
complex numbers e1, e2, e3, the equation
y2 = 4(x −e1)(x −e2)(x −e3)
with complex parameters x and y represents an elliptic curve which allows
the global parametrization
x = ℘(t),
y = ℘′(t),
t ∈C
by the Weierstrass ℘-function. This is an elliptic (i.e., double-periodic) func-
tion whose two complex periods depend on e1, e2, e3. The fundamental geo-
metric result reads now as follows:
(i) Each compact Riemann surface of genus zero (i.e., each complex curve of
circle type) allows two global parametrizations by either periodic func-
tions or rational functions.
(ii) Each compact Riemann surface of genus one (i.e., each elliptic curve)
allows two global parametrizations by either double-periodic functions
or modular functions.
(iii) Each compact Riemann surface of genus g ≥2 can be globally parame-
trized by automorphic functions.26
The global parametrization (i) of elliptic curves by elliptic functions is one of
the most famous results of 19th century mathematics due to Jacobi, Riemann,
and Weierstrass. The general result (ii) on the global parametrization of el-
liptic curves by modular functions was only proved in 1999, i.e., it was shown
that the full Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture is true. Statement (iii) rep-
resents the famous uniformization theorem for compact Riemann surfaces
which was proved independently by Koebe and Poincar´e in 1907 after strong
eﬀorts made by Poincar´e and Klein. The existence of double-periodic func-
tions was discovered by Gauss in 1797 while studying the geometric properties
of the lemniscate introduced by Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705). Therefore, the
innocent looking three statements (i), (ii), (iii) above are the result of 200
years of intense mathematical research. Summarizing, in the sense of Hilbert,

Prologue
the famous Fermat conjecture could ﬁnally be solved because it could be re-
duced to the general idea of modular curves. In a fascinating essay on the
future of mathematics, Arthur Jaﬀe (born 1937) from Harvard University
wrote the following:27
Mathematical research should be as broad and as original as possible, with
very long range-goals. We expect history to repeat itself: we expect that
the most profound and useful future applications of mathematics cannot
be predicted today, since they will arise from mathematics yet to be dis-
covered.
Studying the physics and mathematics of the fundamental forces in na-
ture, there arises the question about the philosophical background. Concern-
ing this, let me ﬁnish with two quotations. Erich Worbs writes in his Gauss
biography:
Sartorius von Waltershausen reports that Gauss once said there were ques-
tions of inﬁnitely higher value than the mathematical ones, namely, those
about our relation to God, our determination, and our future. Only, he con-
cluded, their solutions lie far beyond our comprehension, and completely
outside the ﬁeld of science.
In the Harnack Building of the Max-Planck Society in Berlin, one can read
the following words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe:
The greatest joy of a thinking man is to have explored the explorable and
just to admire the unexplorable.
27 Ordering the universe: the role of mathematics, Notices Amer. Math. Soc. 236
(1984), 589–608.

1. Historical Introduction
If we wish to foresee the future of mathematics our proper course is to
study the history and present condition of the science.
Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912)
It is not the knowledge but the learning, not the possessing, but the earn-
ing, not the being there but the getting there, which gives us the greatest
pleasure.
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
to his Hungarian friend Janos B´olyai
For me, as a young man, Hilbert (1858–1943) became the kind of math-
ematician which I admired, a man with an enormous power of abstract
thought, combined with a fully developed sense for the physical reality.
Norbert Wiener (1894–1964)
In the fall 1926, the young John von Neumann (1903–1957) arrived in
G¨ottingen to take up his duties as Hilbert’s assistant. These were the hec-
tic years during which quantum mechanics was developing with breakneck
speed, with a new idea popping up every few weeks from all over the hori-
zon. The theoretical physicists Born, Dirac, Heisenberg, Jordan, Pauli, and
Schr¨odinger who were developing the new theory were groping for adequate
mathematical tools. It ﬁnally dawned upon them that their ‘observables’
had properties which made them look like Hermitean operators in Hilbert
space, and that by an extraordinary coincidence, the ‘spectrum’ of Hilbert
(which he had chosen around 1900 from a superﬁcial analogy) was to be
the central conception in the explanation of the ‘spectra’ of atoms. It
was therefore natural that they should enlist Hilbert’s help to put some
mathematical sense in their formal computations. With the assistance of
Nordheim and von Neumann, Hilbert ﬁrst tried integral operators in the
space L2, but that needed the use of the Dirac delta function δ, a concept
which was for the mathematicians of that time self-contradictory. John
von Neumann therefore resolved to try another approach.
Jean Dieudonn´e (1906–1992)
History of Functional Analysis1
Stimulated by an interest in quantum mechanics, John von Neumann be-
gan the work in operator theory which he was to continue as long as he
lived. Most of the ideas essential for an abstract theory had already been

1. Historical Introduction
developed by the Hungarian mathematician Fryges Riesz, who had estab-
lished the spectral theory for bounded Hermitean operators in a form very
much like as regarded now standard. Von Neumann saw the need to ex-
tend Riesz’s treatment to unbounded operators and found a clue to doing
this in Carleman’s highly original work on integral operators with singular
kernels. . .
The result was a paper von Neumann submitted for publication to the
Mathematische Zeitschrift but later withdrew. The reason for this with-
drawal was that in 1928 Erhard Schmidt and myself, independently, saw
the role which could be played in the theory by the concept of the adjoint
operator, and the importance which should be attached to self-adjoint
operators. When von Neumann learned from Professor Schmidt of this ob-
servation, he was able to rewrite his paper in a much more satisfactory and
complete form. . . Incidentally, for permission to withdraw the paper, the
publisher exacted from Professor von Neumann a promise to write a book
on quantum mechanics. The book soon appeared and has become one of
the classics of modern physics.2
Marshall Harvey Stone (1903–1989)
1.1 The Revolution of Physics
At the beginning of the 20th century, Max Planck (1858–1947) and Albert
Einstein (1879–1955) completely revolutionized physics. In 1900, Max Planck
derived the universal radiation law for stars by postulating that
The action in our world is quantized.
Let us discuss this fundamental physical principle. The action is the most im-
portant physical quantity in nature. For any process, the action is the product
of energy × time for a small time interval. The total action during a ﬁxed
time interval is then given by an integral summing over small time intervals.
The fundamental principle of least (or more precisely, critical) action tells us
the following:
A process in nature proceeds in such a way that the action becomes
minimal under appropriate boundary conditions.
More precisely, the action is critical. This means that the ﬁrst variation of
the action S vanishes, δS = 0. In 1918 Emmy Noether (1882–1935) proved
a fundamental mathematical theorem. The famous Noether theorem tells us
that
Conservation laws in physics are caused by symmetries of physical
systems.

tation is taken from F. Browder (Ed.), Functional Analysis and Related Fields,

1.1 The Revolution of Physics
23
To explain this basic principle for describing nature in terms of mathemat-
ics, consider our solar system. The motion of the sun and the planets only
depends on the initial positions and initial velocities. Obviously, the motion
of the solar system is invariant under time translations, spatial translations,
and rotations. This is responsible for conservation of energy, momentum, and
angular momentum, respectively. For example, invariance under time trans-
lations means the following. If a process of the physical system is possible,
x = x(t), then each process is also possible which is obtained by time trans-
lation, x = x(t + const). According to Planck, the smallest amount of action
in nature is equal to
h = 6.260 0755 · 10−34Js
(1.1)
where 1 Joule = 1 kg · m2/s2. We also introduce ℏ:= h/2π. The universal
constant h is the famous Planck quantum of action (or the Planck constant).
Observe that the action of typical processes in daily life has the magnitude
of 1 Js. Therefore, the Planck constant is tiny. Nevertheless, the quantization
of action has enormous consequences. For example, consider a mass point on
the real line which moves periodically,
q(t) = const · sin(ωt)
where t denotes time, and ω is called the angular frequency of the harmonic
oscillator. Since the sine function has period 2π, the harmonic oscillator has
the time period T = 2π/ω. By deﬁnition, the frequency ν is the number
of oscillations per second. Hence T = 1/ν, and ω = 2πν. If E denotes the
energy of the harmonic oscillator, then the product ET is a typical action
value for the oscillations of the harmonic oscillator. Therefore, according to
Planck’s quantization of action, it seems to be quite natural to postulate
that ET = nh for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . This yields Planck’s quantization rule for
the energy of the harmonic oscillator,
E = nℏω,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
from the year 1900. About 25 years later, the young physicist Werner Heisen-
berg (1901–1976) invented the full quantization procedure of classical me-
chanics. Using implicitly the commutation rule
qp −pq = iℏ
(1.2)
for the position q and the momentum p of a quantum particle, Heisenberg
obtained the precise formula
E =

n + 1
2

ℏω,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(1.3)
for the quantized energy levels of a harmonic oscillator. Heisenberg’s quantum
mechanics changed completely the paradigm of physics. In classical physics,

24
1. Historical Introduction
observables are real numbers. In Heisenberg’s approach, observables are ab-
stract quantities which obey certain commutation rules. More than ﬁfty years
before Heisenberg’s discovery, the great Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie (1842–1899) found out that commutation rules of type (1.2) play a fun-
damental role when trying to study continuous symmetry groups by means
of linearization. In 1934, for this kind of algebraic structure, the term “Lie
algebra” was coined by Hermann Weyl (1885–1955). Lie algebras and their
generalizations to inﬁnite dimensions, like the Virasoro algebra and super-
symmetric algebras in string theory and conformal quantum ﬁeld theory, are
crucial for modern quantum physics. The Heisenberg formula (1.3) tells us
that the ground state of each harmonic oscillator has the non-vanishing en-
ergy
E = ℏω
2 .
(1.4)
This fact causes tremendous diﬃculties in quantum ﬁeld theories. Since a
quantum ﬁeld has an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, the ground state
has an inﬁnite energy. There are tricks to cure the situation a little bit, but
the inﬁnite ground state energy is the deeper reason for the appearance of
nasty divergent quantities in quantum ﬁeld theory. Physicists have developed
the ingenious method of renormalization in order to extract ﬁnite quanti-
ties that can be measured in physical experiments. Surprisingly enough, in
quantum electrodynamics there is an extremely precise coincidence with the
renormalized theoretical values and the values measured in particle acceler-
ator experiments. No one understands this. Nowadays many physicists are
convinced that this approach is not the ﬁnal word. There must be a deeper
theory behind. One promising candidate is string theory.
At the end of his life, Albert Einstein wrote the following about his ﬁrst
years.
Between the ages of 12–16, I familiarized myself with the elements of math-
ematics. In doing so I had the good fortune of discovering books which were
not too particular in their logical rigor.
In 1896, at the age of 17, I entered the Swiss Institute of Technology
(ETH) in Zurich. There I had excellent teachers, for example, Hurwitz
(1859–1919) and Minkowski (1864–1909), so that I really could get a sound
mathematical education. However, most of the time, I worked in the phys-
ical laboratory, fascinated by the direct contact with experience. The rest
of the time I used, in the main, to study at home the works of Kirchhoﬀ
(1824–1887), Helmholtz (1821–1894), Hertz (1857–1894), and so on. The
fact that I neglected mathematics to a certain extent had its cause not
merely in my stronger interest in the natural sciences than in mathemat-
ics, but also in the following strange experience. I saw that mathematics
was split up into numerous specialities, each of which could easily absorb
the short life granted to us. Consequently, I saw myself in the position
of Buridan’s ass which was unable to decide upon any speciﬁc bundle of
hay. This was obviously due to the fact that my intuition was not strong
enough in the ﬁeld of mathematics in order to diﬀerentiate clearly that

which was fundamentally important, and that which is really basic, from
the rest of the more or less dispensable erudition, and it was not clear to
me as a student that the approach to a more profound knowledge of the
basic principles of physics is tied up with the most intricate mathematical
methods. This only dawned upon me gradually after years of independent
scientiﬁc work. True enough, physics was also divided into separate ﬁelds.
In this ﬁeld, however, I soon learned to scent out that which was able to
lead to fundamentals.3
After his studies, Einstein got a position at the Swiss patent oﬃce in Bern.
In 1905 Einstein published four fundamental papers on the theory of special
relativity, the equivalence between mass and energy, the Brownian motion,
and the light particle hypothesis in Volume 17 of the journal Annalen der
Physik.
The theory of special relativity completely changed our philosophy
about space and time.
According to Einstein, there is no absolute time, but time changes from
observer to observer. This follows from the surprising fact that the velocity
of light has the same value in each inertial system, which was established
experimentally by Albert Michelson (1852–1931) in 1887. From his principle
of relativity, Einstein deduced that a point particle of rest mass m0 and
momentum vector p has a positive energy E given by
E2 = m2
0c4 + c2p2
(1.5)
where c denotes the velocity of light in a vacuum. If the particle moves with
sub-velocity of light, x = x(t), than it has the mass
m =
m0

1 −˙x(t)2/c2 .
(1.6)
If the particle rests, then we get
E = m0c2.
(1.7)
This magic energy formula governs the energy production in our sun by
helium synthesis. Thus, our life depends crucially on this formula. Unfortu-
nately, the atomic bomb is based on this formula, too.
Let us now discuss the historical background of Einstein’s light parti-
cle hypothesis. Maxwell (1831–1879) conjectured in 1862 that light is an
electromagnetic wave. In 1886 Heinrich Hertz established the existence of
electromagnetic waves by a famous experiment carried out at Kiel Univer-
sity (Germany). When electromagnetic radiation is incident on the surface

1. Historical Introduction
of a metal, it is observed that electrons may be ejected. This phenomenon
is called the photoelectric eﬀect. This eﬀect was ﬁrst observed by Heinrich
Hertz in 1887. Fifteen years later, Philipp Lenard (1862–1947) observed that
the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons does not depend on the intensity
of light. In order to explain the photoelectric eﬀect, Einstein postulated in
1905 that electromagnetic waves are quantized. That is, light consists of light
particles (or light quanta) which were coined photons in 1926 by the physical
chemist Gilbert Lewis. According to Einstein, a light particle (photon) has
the energy E given by Planck’s quantum hypothesis,
E = hν.
(1.8)
Here, ν is the frequency of light, which is related to the wave length λ by the
dispersion relation λν = c. Hence E = hc/λ. This means that a blue photon
has more energy than a red one. Since a photon moves with light speed, its
rest mass must be zero. Thus, from (1.5) we obtain |p| = E/c. If we introduce
the angular frequency ω = 2πν, then we obtain the ﬁnal expression
E = ℏω,
p = ℏk,
|k| = ω
c
(1.9)
for the energy E and the momentum vector p of a photon. Here, the wave
vector k of length k = ω/c is parallel to the vector p. Nowadays we know that
light particles are quanta, and that quantum particles are physical objects
which possess a strange structure. Quanta combine features of both waves
and particles. In the photoelectric eﬀect, a photon hits an electron such that
the electron leaves the metal. The energy of the electron is given by
E = ℏω −W
where the so-called work function W depends on the binding energy of the
electrons in the atoms of the metal. This energy formula suggests that for
small angular frequencies ω no electrons can leave the metal, since there
would be E < 0, a contradiction. In fact, this has been observed in experi-
ments. Careful experiments were performed by Millikan (1868–1953) in 1916.
He found out that a typical constant in his experiments coincided with the
Planck constant, as predicted by Einstein. In 1921 Einstein was awarded the
Nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric eﬀect. As a curiosity let us
mention, that Max Planck, while recommending Einstein enthusiastically for
a membership in the Prussian Academy in Berlin, wrote the following:
That sometimes, in his speculations, he went too far, such as, for example,
in his hypothesis of the light quanta, should not be held too much against
him.

1.2 Quantization in a Nutshell
27
1.2 Quantization in a Nutshell
In 1926 Born discovered the fundamental fact that quantum physics is intrin-
sically connected with random processes. Hence the mathematical theory of
probability plays a crucial role in quantum physics. Already Maxwell (1831–
1879) had emphasized:
The true logic of this world lies in probability theory.
Before discussing the randomness of quantum processes and the challenge
of quantization, let us mention that Maxwell strongly inﬂuenced the physics
of the 20th century. As we will show later on, Einstein’s theory of special
relativity follows from the invariance of the Maxwell equations in electro-
magnetism under Lorentz transformations. Moreover, the generalization of
the Maxwell equations from the commutative gauge group U(1) to the non-
commutative gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3) leads to the Standard Model in
particle physics. Finally, statistical physics can be traced back to Maxwell’s
statistical velocity distribution of molecules.
From the physical point of view, quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld
theory are described best by the Feynman approach via Feynman diagrams,
transition amplitudes, Feynman propagators (Green’s functions), and func-
tional integrals. In order to make the reader familiar with the fascinating
story of this approach, let us start with a quotation taken from Freeman
Dyson’s book Disturbing the Universe, Harper & Row, New York, 1979:4
Dick Feynman (1918–1988) was a profoundly original scientist. He refused
to take anybody’s word for anything. This meant that he was forced to
rediscover or reinvent for himself almost the whole physics. It took him
ﬁve years of concentrated work to reinvent quantum mechanics. He said
that he couldn’t understand the oﬃcial version of quantum mechanics
that was taught in the textbooks and so he had to begin afresh from the
beginning. This was a heroic enterprise. He worked harder during those
years than anybody else I ever knew. At the end he had his version of
quantum mechanics that he could understand. . .
The calculations that I did for Hans Bethe,5 using the orthodox method,
took me several months of work and several hundred sheets of paper.
Dick could get the same answer, calculating on a blackboard, in
half an hour. . .
In orthodox physics, it can be said: Suppose an electron is in this state
at a certain time, then you calculate what it will do next by solving the
Schr¨odinger equation introduced by Schr¨odinger in 1926. Instead of this,
Dick simply said:

tributions to nuclear reactions, especially his discoveries concerning the energy
production in stars. See H. Bethe, R. Bacher, and M. Livingstone, Basic Bethe:

1. Historical Introduction
The electron does whatever it likes.
A history of the electron is any possible path in space and time. The
behavior of the electron is just the result of adding together all the histories
according to some simple rules that Dick worked out. I had the enormous
luck to be at Cornell in 1948 when the idea was newborn, and to be for a
short time Dick’s sounding board. . .
Dick distrusted my mathematics and I distrusted his intuition.
Dick fought against my scepticism, arguing that Einstein had failed be-
cause he stopped thinking in concrete physical images and became a ma-
nipulator of equations. I had to admit that was true. The discoveries of
Einstein’s earlier years were all based on direct physical intuition. Ein-
stein’s later uniﬁed theories failed because they were only sets of equations
without physical meaning. . .
Nobody but Dick could use his theory. Without success I tried to under-
stand him. . . At the beginning of September after vacations it was time to
go back East. I got onto a Greyhound bus and travelled nonstop for three
days and nights as far as Chicago. This time I had nobody to talk to. The
roads were too bumpy for me to read, and so I sat and looked out of the
window and gradually fell into a comfortable stupor. As we were droning
across Nebraska on the third day, something suddenly happened. For two
weeks I had not thought about physics, and now it came bursting into
my consciousness like an explosion. Feynman’s pictures and Schwinger’s
equations began sorting themselves out in my head with a clarity they had
never had before. I had no pencil or paper, but everything was so clear I
did not need to write it down.
Feynman and Schwinger were just looking at the same set of ideas
from two diﬀerent sides.
Putting their methods together, you would have a theory of quantum elec-
trodynamics that combined the mathematical precision of Schwinger with
the practical ﬂexibility of Feynman. . .
During the rest of the day as we watched the sun go down over the prairie,
I was mapping out in my head the shape of the paper I would write when
I got to Princeton. The title of the paper would be The radiation theories
of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman.6

From the physical point of view, the following formulas are special cases of
more general formulas due to Heisenberg in 1925, Born and Jordan in 1926,
Schr¨odinger in 1926, Dirac in 1927, Feynman in 1942, Heisenberg in 1943,
Dyson in 1949, Lippmann and Schwinger in 1950. In fact, we will study the
following approaches to quantum mechanics:
• the 1925 Heisenberg particle picture via time-dependent operators as ob-
servables, and the Poisson–Lie operator equation of motion,
• the 1926 Schr¨odinger wave picture via time-dependent quantum states, and
the Schr¨odinger partial diﬀerential equation of motion,
• the 1927 Dirac interaction picture which describes the motion under an
interacting force as a perturbation of the interaction-free dynamics, and
• the 1942 Feynman picture based on a statistics for possible classical mo-
tions via the Feynman path integral, which generalizes the 1923 Wiener
integral for the mathematical description of Einstein’s Brownian motion in
diﬀusion processes from the year 1905.
The fact that it is possible to describe quantum particles in an equivalent way
by either Heisenberg’s particle picture or Schr¨odinger’s wave picture reﬂects
a general duality principle in quantum physics:
Quantum particles are more general objects than classical particles
and classical waves.
This has been discovered in the history of physics step by step. Note that,
for didactic reasons, in this section we will not follow the historical route,
but we will present the material in a manner which is most convenient from
the modern point of view.7 Nowadays most physicists prefer the Feynman

approach to quantum physics. In what follows we restrict ourselves to formal
considerations.
Hints for quick reading. After reading Sects. 1.2.1 through 1.2.4, the
reader may pass to Sects. 15.1 through 15.5 on the operator approach to
quantum ﬁeld theory. A rigorous approach to the basic ideas in quantum ﬁeld
theory in terms of a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space setting can be found in
Chap. 7. The true mathematical diﬃculties in quantum ﬁeld theory are re-
lated to the inﬁnite-dimensional setting. However, rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional
models help to understand the mathematical substance of the magic formulas
used by physicists in quantum ﬁeld theory in a formal way. These magic for-
mulas are due to Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann and Low, Faddeev
and Popov. They can be found in Chaps. 14 through 16. The reader who
wants to become familiar, as quickly as possible, with applications of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory to concrete physical processes in quantum electrodynamics
should pass to Volume II.
1.2.1 Basic Formulas
The classical principle of critical action. For the mathematical descrip-
tion of physics, it is crucial that the fundamental processes in nature are
governed by an optimality principle called the principle of least action. In
fact, the action is not always minimal in nature, but sometimes the action
is only critical (also called stationary). Therefore, we have to speak about
the principle of critical action. In the history of physics, the role of varia-
tional principles was underlined by Fermat (1601–1665), Maupertius (1698–
1759), Euler (1707–1783), Lagrange (1736–1813), Gauss (1777–1855), Hamil-
ton (1788–1856), and Jacobi (1804–1851). As the simplest example for the
principle of critical action, let us start with the following variational problem
 t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t)) dt = critical!
(1.10)
for the motion, q = q(t), of a classical particle with mass m on the real line
(Fig. 1.1). This is called the principle of critical action. Here, q(t) denotes
the position of the classical particle at time t. Following Newton, the dot, ˙q,
denotes the derivative with respect to time. We have to add the boundary
condition
q(t0) = x0,
q(t1) = x1
(1.11)
for given initial point x0 at the initial time t0, and given ﬁnal point x1 at
the ﬁnal time t1. The function L = L(q, ˙q) is called Lagrangian; it has the
physical dimension of energy. More important than energy is the action S of
the classical motion, q = q(t), during the time interval [t0, t1]. Explicitly,

q(t)
q
Fig. 1.1. Motion on the real line
S[q] :=
 t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t)) dt.
Here, the action S has the physical dimension of energy × time. Each
smooth solution of the variational problem (1.10) satisﬁes the following
Euler–Lagrange equation8
d
dtL ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t)) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t))
(1.12)
for all times t ∈[t0, t1]. Since the Lagrangian L = L(q, ˙q) does not depend
explicitly on time t, it is invariant under time translations t →t + const. By
the Noether theorem, each solution, q = q(t), of the Euler–Lagrange equation
satisﬁes the conservation law
dE(t)
dt
= 0
for all
t ∈[t0, t1]
(1.13)
with the momentum function p(t) := L ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t)), and the energy function
E(t) := p(t) ˙q(t) −L(q(t), ˙q(t)).
The relation (1.13) tells us that the energy E(t) does not depend on time
along the classical trajectory. This is called conservation of energy.9 Generally,
from the mathematical point of view, the fundamental notion of energy is
intimately related to symmetry properties of physical systems, namely, the
invariance under time translations.
The Feynman picture of quantum mechanics and the Feynman
path integral. We want to consider the motion of a quantum particle on the
real line. This motion is described by a complex-valued function ψ = ψ(x, t)
whose physical meaning will be explained below. From the physical point of
view, the best interpretation of the passage from the classical motion of the
particle to the corresponding quantum motion can be obtained by the famous
Feynman formula
8 The symbol L ˙q denotes the partial derivative of the function L = L(q, ˙q) with
respect to the variable ˙q.
9 Without referring to the general Noether theorem, energy conservation follows
directly from the Euler–Lagrange equation, ˙p = Lq. In fact, diﬀerentiation with
respect to time t yields
˙E = ˙p ˙q + p¨q −L ˙q ¨q −Lq ˙q = ( ˙p −Lq) ˙q = 0.

1. Historical Introduction
P(x1, t1; x0, t0) =

eiS[q]/ℏDq.
(1.14)
Formally, we sum over all possible classical trajectories q = q(t) which satisfy
the boundary condition (1.11). The integral from (1.14) is called a Feynman
path integral (or functional integral). It represents a statistic over the possible
trajectories of the classical particle. The statistical weight eiS[q]/ℏfor each
trajectory depends on the classical action S[q] of the trajectory. Since the
quantity S[q] has the physical dimension of energy × time, we have to divide
the action S[q] by a constant ℏof the same dimension in order to get a
dimensionless argument of the exponential function.
This way, Planck’s constant of action, ℏ, appears in a natural way.
It was noticed by Feynman that, because of the smallness of the Planck
constant ℏ, a formal application of Kelvin’s method of stationary phase in
optics tells us that, naturally enough, the main contribution to the integral
(1.14) comes from that classical trajectory which corresponds to the solution
of the principle of critical action (1.10).
Quantum motion is obtained from classical motion by adding random
quantum ﬂuctuations.
In particular, quantum mechanics passes over to classical mechanics if
ℏ→0.
This limit corresponds to the passage from wave optics to geometric optics
if the wave length of light goes to zero, λ →0.
In terms of mathematics, quantization of a classical theory corre-
sponds to a deformation of the classical theory which depends on the
Planck parameter ℏ.
It remains to discuss the physical meaning of the Feynman propagator ker-
nel P and of the function ψ. According to Feynman’s 1942 dissertation at
Princeton University, the dynamics of the function ψ is governed by the cru-
cial formula
ψ(x1, t1) =
 ∞
−∞
P(x1, t1; x0, t0)ψ(x0, t0) dx0
(1.15)
for all positions x1 and all times t1 ≥t0. We write this brieﬂy as
ψ(t1) = P(t1, t0)ψ(t0).
(1.16)
The operator P(t1, t0) is called the Feynman propagator.
The simplest example corresponds to the motion of a free particle on the
real line. In this case, the Lagrangian reads as

1.2 Quantization in a Nutshell
33
L(q, ˙q) := m ˙q2
2 .
The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation, m¨q = 0, has the general solu-
tion
q(t) = x0 + v(t −t0),
t ∈R.
This describes the motion of a point particle on the real line with the constant
velocity v. The corresponding Feynman propagator kernel is given by
P(x1, t1; x0, t0) =

m
2πiℏ(t1 −t0)
· e−m(x1−x0)2
2iℏ(t1−t0) .
Here, we choose the value
√
i := eiπ/4 for the square root of the imaginary
unit. Using the replacement it →t, the Feynman kernel, P, passes over to
Fourier’s heat kernel for both the propagation of heat and the diﬀusion of
particles (Brownian motion) on the real line. This will be studied in Sect.
11.1.3 on page 586.
Born’s interpretation of the Schr¨odinger ψ-function. In 1926
Schr¨odinger formulated his famous partial diﬀerential equation for some wave
function ψ which will be considered below. Surprisingly enough, Schr¨odinger
was very successful in computing the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen
atom, but he did not know the physical meaning of the function ψ. This was
discovered by Born a few months later by studying scattering processes for
electrons.
According to Born, the value |ψ(x, t)|2 plays the role of a probability
density.
This changes physics dramatically. In contrast to classical physics, quantum
processes are random processes. More precisely, we have to distinguish be-
tween the following two cases.
(i) Case 1: One single particle. Suppose that  ∞
−∞|ψ(x, t)|2dx < ∞. Then
the function ψ describes a single particle on the real line. The quotient
 b
a |ψ(x, t)|2 dx
 ∞
−∞|ψ(x, t)|2 dx
is equal to the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the interval [a, b]
of the real line at time t. In addition, let us introduce the momentum
operator P and the position operator Q,
(Pψ)(x) := −iℏd
dxψ(x),
(Qψ)(x) := xψ(x),
x ∈R,
along with the inner product
⟨χ|ψ⟩:=
 ∞
−∞
χ(x)†ψ(x) dx.

1. Historical Introduction
For a classical particle on the real line, position q and momentum p = mv
(mass × velocity) can be measured with arbitrarily high precision at the
same time. This is not true anymore for a quantum particle on the real
line. In fact, in the quantum state ψ = ψ(x) it is only possible to measure
the mean position q and the ﬂuctuation ∆q of the position. Explicitly,
q = ⟨ψ|Qψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩=
 ∞
−∞ψ(x)†xψ(x) dx
 ∞
−∞ψ(x)†ψ(x) dx
and
(∆q)2 = ⟨ψ|(Q −q )2ψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩
=
 ∞
−∞ψ(x)†(x −q)2ψ(x) dx
 ∞
−∞ψ(x)†ψ(x) dx
.
Similarly, for the measured mean momentum p and its ﬂuctuation ∆p,
we get
p = ⟨ψ|Pψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩,
(∆p)2 = ⟨ψ|(P −p )2ψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩
.
If the function ψ = ψ(x, t) also depends on time t, then so do the mea-
sured values. In 1927 Heisenberg showed that there holds the following
fundamental inequality for the ﬂuctuations:
∆p∆q ≥ℏ
2.
(1.17)
This famous uncertainty inequality tells us that, in contrast to classical
particles, it is not possible to measure precisely position and momentum
of a quantum particle at the same time. If the measurement of the po-
sition of a quantum particle is fairly precise (i.e., ∆q is small), then the
velocity of the particle is quite uncertain (i.e., ∆p is large). Conversely, if
the velocity is known fairly precisely (i.e., ∆p is small), then the position
of the quantum particle is quite uncertain (i.e., ∆q is large).
(ii) Case 2: Homogeneous stream of particles. Suppose that
 ∞
−∞
|ψ(x, t)|2dx = ∞.
Then the function ψ describes a ﬂow of identical particles on the real line
which has the current density vector
J(x, t) := ϱ(x, t)v(x, t)
with the particle density ϱ(x, t) := |ψ(x, t)|2 and the velocity vector
v(x, t) at the point x at time t. Explicitly,
J(x, t) = ℜ

The unit vector e points from left to right on the real line. For example,
choose the function
ψ(x, t) := √ϱ0 · ei(px−Ept)/ℏ
with ﬁxed real number p and Ep := p2/2m. This function describes a
homogeneous stream of particles with momentum p, energy Ep, and par-
ticle density ϱ(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2 = ϱ0. The particle momentum p is an
eigenvalue of the momentum operator P,
Pψ = pψ,
and the particle energy Ep is an eigenvalue of the energy operator,
iℏ∂
∂tψ = Epψ.
Moreover, we have J(x, t) = ϱ0v along with the velocity vector v = pe/m.
Observe that the measured values of a single particle are based on the inner
product ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩. This is the key to John von Neumann’s Hilbert space approach
to quantum mechanics from the late 1920s. However, the Hilbert space setting
is not suﬃcient, since states ψ with ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= ∞appear which do not lie in
the Hilbert space under consideration. To include such states, one has to use
Gelfand’s theory of rigged Hilbert spaces from the 1950s which is based on
the notion of generalized functions (distributions). This will be studied in
Sect. 12.2 on page 675.
The Schr¨odinger wave picture for quantum mechanics on the
real line. Consider the special case where the Lagrangian is given by
L(q, ˙q) := m ˙q2
2
−κU(q).
Here, the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion reads as
m¨q = −κU ′(q).
This is the Newtonian equation of motion with the force F(q) := −κU ′(q).
For the momentum, p(t) = m ˙q(t). The function U is called the potential,
and the real number κ is called coupling constant.10 For the motion q = q(t)
of the classical particle on the real line, we have conservation of energy, i.e.,
there exists a constant E such that
E = p(t)2
2m + κU(q(t))
(1.18)
10 In many cases, the coupling constant κ is small. Then, it is possible to apply the
methods of perturbation theory. This is of fundamental importance for quantum
ﬁeld theory.

(1.20)
Recall that the dot, ˙ψ, denotes the partial derivative with respect to time.
In the history of mathematics and physics, it was gradually discovered that
the solutions of partial diﬀerential equations can be represented by integral
formulas with appropriate kernels which are called Green’s functions. In par-
ticular, the corresponding solution formula for the initial-value problem to
the Schr¨odinger equation (1.20) reads as
ψ(x, t) =
 ∞
−∞
G(x, t; y, t0)ψ(y, t0)dy
(1.21)
for all positions x ∈R and all times t ≥t0. Comparing this with Feynman’s
formula (1.15), we see that
G(x, t; y, t0) ≡P(x, t; y, t0).
Consequently, the Feynman propagator kernel is nothing than the Green’s
function to the initial-value problem for the Schr¨odinger equation (1.20). In
fact, if we know the initial state ψ(x, t0) of the quantum particle at the initial
time t0, then formula (1.21) determines the state ψ = ψ(x, t) for all times
t ≥t0 in the future. This tells us that
The Feynman propagator kernel knows all about the motion of the
quantum particle on the real line.
By physical considerations, Feynman discovered that the Feynman kernel
can be represented by a path integral of the form (1.14). This discovery was
crucial for the further development of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Schr¨odinger’s method for computing quantized energies by solv-
ing eigenvalue problems. Motivated by the classical Fourier method,
Schr¨odinger made the separation ansatz

ψ(x, t) = ϕ(x)e−iEt/ℏ.
Then, the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (1.19) passes over to the
stationary Schr¨odinger equation
Eϕ(x) = −ℏ2
2m ϕ′′(x) + κ U(x)ϕ(x),
x ∈R.
This is an eigenvalue problem for the unknown energy E. Using this method,
Schr¨odinger computed the quantized energies of quantum particles. Inter-
estingly enough, Schr¨odinger did not know the precise physical meaning of
the complex wave function ψ. This problem was solved by Born in 1926;
Born discovered the statistical interpretation of |ψ(x, t)|2 discussed above.
Schr¨odinger and Born were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1933 and
1954, respectively.
Von Neumann’s solution of the Schr¨odinger equation. Let us in-
troduce the free Hamiltonian
H0 := P 2
2m = −ℏ2
2m

∂x2
along with the Hamiltonian
H := H0 + κU.
Then, the Schr¨odinger equation (1.19) can be written as an operator equation
of the form
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t)
(1.22)
for all times t ∈R. If we consider equation (1.22) as a classical ordinary
diﬀerential equation, then the solution reads as
ψ(t) = e−i(t−t0)H/ℏψ(t0)
for all
t ∈R.
(1.23)
Let us now discuss the mathematical meaning of the operator e−itH/ℏ.
Von Neumann’s operator calculus. In the late 1920s, von Neumann
developed a calculus for unbounded self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces
which gives the exponential function for operators a precise meaning un-
der appropriate assumptions on the Hamiltonian H.11 In the sense of von
Neumann’s operator calculus, formula (1.23) solves the Schr¨odinger equation
(1.19), and it describes completely the dynamics of the quantum particle on
the real line. Comparing this with equation (1.16), ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ(t0), we
see that the Feynman propagator is given by
11 The operator H has to be a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space L2(R).

1. Historical Introduction
P(t, t0) = e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ
for all
t, t0 ∈R.
Generalizing Hilbert’s spectral theory from 1904 for bounded symmetric op-
erators to unbounded self-adjoint operators in 1928, von Neumann justiﬁed
the formula
H =
 ∞
λ=−∞
λdEλ
where the operators Eλ : X →X are orthogonal projection operators on the
Hilbert space X = L2(R). Moreover, f(H) =
 ∞
λ=−∞f(λ)dEλ. In particular,
e−itH/ℏ=
 ∞
λ=−∞
e−itλ/ℏdEλ.
The family {Eλ} of operators Eλ with λ ∈R is called the spectral family of
the Hamiltonian H. In order to discuss the physical meaning of the spectral
family, choose a ﬁxed particle state on the real line, ψ ∈X, normalized by
⟨ψ|ψ⟩=
 ∞
−∞
|ψ(x, t)|2dx = 1.
Suppose we are measuring the energy E of the particle in the state ψ. Then,
the probability P of ﬁnding the measured value E in the interval J is given
by the integral
P :=

J
dF(λ).
Here, the function F(λ0) :=

]−∞,λ0[ dσ(λ) with σ(λ) := ⟨ψ|Eλψ⟩represents
the probability distribution of the energy of the quantum particle on the real
line in the given state ψ. By the theory of probability, for the mean value E
and the ﬂuctuation ∆E of the measured energy, we get
E =
 ∞
−∞
λdF(λ),
(∆E)2 =
 ∞
−∞
(λ −E)2dF(λ).
In particular, if the function F is smooth, then dF(λ) can be replaced by
F ′(λ)dλ where F ′(λ) = σ(λ).
According to von Neumann, the spectral family can be constructed for all
self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. Such operators represent observables
in quantum mechanics. Therefore, the theory of spectral families allows us to
describe the random measurements of observables in quantum mechanics.12
Heisenberg’s S-matrix for scattering processes. The most impor-
tant processes for elementary particles are scattering processes in particle

physics, we recommend Zeidler (1995), Vols. 1, 2.

accelerators. Therefore, physicists are mainly interested in computing scat-
tering processes. For this, the main tool is the S-matrix which was introduced
by Wheeler in 1937 and Heisenberg in 1943. The further development was
strongly inﬂuenced by Heisenberg’s paper from 1943.
The S-matrix is closely related to physical quantities which can be
measured in experiments.
This underlines the importance of the S-matrix. Let us discuss this in terms
of scattering processes on the real line. To this end, set
ψin(x, t) := √ϱin · ei(pinx−Eint)/ℏ
and
ψout(x, t) := √ϱout · ei(poutx−Eoutt)/ℏ.
We regard ψin as a stream of incoming free particles with
• momentum vector pin = pine of the incoming particles,
• velocity vector vin = pin/m of the incoming particles,
• energy Ein = p2
in/2m of the incoming particles, and
• particle density ϱin of the incoming particles.
The corresponding quantities of the outgoing particles are deﬁned similarly.
We assume that the potential U is concentrated in a neighborhood of the
origin. The incoming free particles are then scattered at the potential κU.
This means that some particles are reﬂected at the potential wall and some
of them penetrate the potential wall. We are interested in those particles
which penetrate the potential wall. This yields a stream of outgoing particles
described by the function ψout. Let us introduce the Feynman transition
amplitude
S(q, t1; p, t0) := ⟨ψout|P(t1, t0)ψin⟩.
In this connection, observe that the Feynman propagator P(t1, t0) sends the
incoming state ψin at time t0 to the state
ψ(t1) = P(t1, t0)ψ(t0)
at time t1, and we compare the actual state ψ(t1) with the possible outgoing
state ψout(t1) at time t1 by computing the inner product ⟨ψout(t1)|ψ(t1)⟩.
In terms of the Feynman propagator kernel P, the transition amplitude
S(q, t1; p, t0) is equal to

1. Historical Introduction
ψout(t1) at time t1. It turns out that this transition probability13 is given by
the expression
|S(q, t1; p, t0)|2.
To free ourselves from the arbitrary choice of the initial time t0 and the ﬁnal
time t1, we pass over to the formal limit t0 →−∞and t1 →+∞. This way,
we get
S(q, +∞; p, −∞) :=
lim
t1→+∞
lim
t0→−∞S(q, t1; p, t0).
Physicists call this the S-matrix element for particles with incoming momen-
tum p and outgoing momentum q. The set of all these S-matrix elements
forms the S-matrix S. The corresponding transition probability for the par-
ticle stream is then given by the key formula
|S(q, +∞; p, −∞)|2.
It turns out that these S-matrix elements vanish if q ̸= p, by energy conser-
vation.
The Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. It is possible to com-
pute the S-matrix elements by solving the following Lippmann–Schwinger
integral equation

(1.24)
with ϕ0(x) := eipx/ℏand the kernel

.
The function
ψin(x, t) := e−iEp(t−t0)/ℏϕ0(x)
describes the incoming particle stream with momentum p. If the function
ϕ = ϕ(x) is a solution of (1.24), then
ψ(x, t) := e−iEp(t−t0)/ℏϕ(x)
with Ep := p2/2m is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (1.19) which de-
scribes the scattering of the incoming particle stream ψin. Finally, we compare
the scattered particle stream with the outgoing particle stream
ψout(x, t) := e−iEp(t−t1)/ℏϕ0(x)
of momentum p. This implies
13 In mathematics, transition probability is called conditional probability.

The method of Feynman diagrams. The basic idea of Feynman di-
agrams is to represent graphically the approximations ϕ1, ϕ2, . . .. This tech-
nique is widely used in elementary particle physics; it helps to simplify the
computation of scattering processes, and gives physical insight. In the present
case, for small coupling constant κ, the ﬁrst approximation
ϕ1(x) = ϕ0(x) + κ

G(x, y)U(y)ϕ0(y)dy
is called the Born approximation; it was used by Born in 1926 in order to
compute scattering processes for electrons. The Feynman diagram for ϕ1 is
pictured in Fig. 1.2(a). Intuitively, the interaction between the “particle” ϕ0
and the potential U yields the “particle” ϕ1. The second approximation ϕ2
is given by
ϕ2(x) = ϕ0(x) + κ

G(x, y)U(y)ϕ1(y)dy.
The corresponding Feynman diagram is pictured in Fig. 1.2(b). Intuitively,
the interaction between the “particle” ϕ1 and the potential U yields the
“particle” ϕ2. Observe that

As a rule, each iterative method in mathematics and physics can be

The Heisenberg–Born–Jordan commutation relation. For the mo-
mentum operator P and the position operator Q,
QPψ −PQψ = −iℏ

xψ′(x) −(xψ(x))′
= iℏψ(x).
Letting [Q, P]−:= QP −PQ, we obtain
[Q, P]−= iℏI
where I denotes the identity operator. This is the commutation rule (1.2)
which appeared at the birth of modern quantum mechanics in 1925. The
interesting history of the commutation relation will be discussed in Sect. 1.3
on page 60.
The Heisenberg particle picture for quantum mechanics on the
real line. It was discovered in the 1920s that completely diﬀerent approaches
to quantum mechanics are in fact equivalent. Let us discuss the equivalence
between the Schr¨odinger picture and the Heisenberg picture which was in-
vented before the Schr¨odinger equation. In the Schr¨odinger picture, the dy-
namics of the time-dependent wave function ψ = ψ(t) is governed by the
equation
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0).
In the Heisenberg picture, we introduce the time-dependent momentum op-
erator
P(t) := eitH/ℏPe−itH/ℏ,
the time-dependent position operator
Q(t) := eitH/ℏQe−itH/ℏ,
and the time-independent state ψ(0). For the measured mean-value of mo-
mentum in the Schr¨odinger picture, we get
p = ⟨ψ(t)|Pψ(t)⟩
⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩.
Moreover, we get
p = ⟨ψ(0)|P(t)ψ(0)⟩
⟨ψ(0)|ψ(0)⟩
.
in the Heisenberg picture.15 Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields
15 Note that ⟨Aχ|ψ⟩= ⟨χ|A†ψ⟩. Since H† = H and (e−itH/ℏ)† = eitH/ℏ, we obtain
that the inner product ⟨ψ(t)|Pψ(t)⟩is equal to
⟨e−itH/ℏψ(0)|Pe−itH/ℏψ(0)⟩= ⟨ψ(0)|eitH/ℏPe−itH/ℏψ(0)⟩= ⟨ψ(0)|P(t)ψ(0)⟩.
As an introduction to the theory of Hilbert spaces, we recommend Zeidler (1995),
Vol. 1.

iℏ˙P(t) = P(t)H −HP(t).
This way, we obtain the equations of motion in the Heisenberg picture,
iℏ˙P(t) = [P(t), H]−,
iℏ˙Q(t) = [Q(t), H]−,
along with the commutation relations [Q(t), P(t)]−= iℏI for all times t ∈R.
The Dirac interaction picture for quantum mechanics on the real
line. In order to study the dynamics of perturbed systems, Dirac introduced
the so-called interaction picture which is crucial for quantum ﬁeld theory.
Let us discuss the basic idea of this approach. We start with the Schr¨odinger
equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = (H0 + κU(t))ψ(t).
(1.25)
Here, the potential U = U(t) is allowed to depend on time t. The following
arguments are well-known for classical ordinary diﬀerential equations. The
point is that we will apply formally these arguments to operator diﬀerential
equations, too. The ﬁrst trick is to introduce the new function
Ψ(t) := ei(t−t0)H0/ℏψ(t).
Then Ψ(t0) = ψ(t0). From the Schr¨odinger equation (1.25), we get the new
diﬀerential equation
iℏ˙Ψ(t) = κU(t)Ψ(t),
t ∈R
(1.26)
with the transformed potential16
U(t) := ei(t−t0)H0/ℏU(t) e−i(t−t0)H0/ℏ.
Diﬀerentiation of the function
F(t) = F(t0) +
 t
t0
f(τ)dτ
with respect to time t yields ˙F(t) = f(t). Therefore, the diﬀerential equation
(1.26) is equivalent to the Volterra integral equation
Ψ(t) = Ψ0 + κ
iℏ
 t
t0
U(τ)Ψ(τ)dτ
(1.27)
16 In fact, for simplifying notation, we set ℏ:= 1 and t0 := 0. Then
i ˙Ψ(t) = −H0eitH0ψ(t) + eitH0i ˙ψ(t).
Using i ˙ψ = (H0 + κU)ψ, we obtain the claim (1.26).

if

U(t2)U(t1)
if

commutes with U(t2). However, the chronological operator is crucial if one wants
a straightforward generalization of the argument above to ﬁnite-dimensional sys-
tems of classical ordinary diﬀerential equations and inﬁnite-dimensional operator
equations appearing in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Summarizing, in the Dirac interaction picture we pass from the Schr¨o-
dinger state function ψ = ψ(t) and the potential U = U(t) to the Dirac state
function Ψ and the Dirac potential U, respectively. Explicitly,
Ψ(t) := ei(t−t0)H0/ℏψ(t),
U(t) := ei(t−t0)H0/ℏU(t) e−i(t−t0)H0/ℏ
for all times t ∈R. Here, the Hamiltonian H0 describes the free dynamics
in the Schr¨odinger picture. The Dirac state function Ψ satisﬁes the modiﬁed
Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙Ψ(t) = κU(t)Ψ(t),
t ∈R
and the Dirac potential U satisﬁes the equation of motion
iℏ˙U(t) = [U(t), H0]−+ V (t),
t ∈R
with V (t) := ei(t−t0)H0/ℏ˙U(t)e−i(t−t0)H0/ℏ. If the potential U(t) is time-
independent, then
iℏ˙U(t) = [U(t), H0]−,
t ∈R.
This is the Heisenberg equation of motion with respect to the unperturbed
Hamiltonian H0.
In Chap. 15 we will use this type of argument in order to reduce the
investigation of interacting quantum ﬁelds to free quantum ﬁelds.

1.2.2 The Fundamental Role of the Harmonic Oscillator
in Quantum Field Theory
The present paper seeks to establish a basis for theoretical quantum me-
chanics founded exclusively upon relationships between quantities which
in principle are observable. . . We shall restrict ourselves to problems in-
volving one degree of freedom.18
Werner Heisenberg, 1925
Since the 1920s, the experience of physicists has shown that
Quantum ﬁelds can be treated as nonlinear perturbations of an inﬁnite
number of uncoupled quantized harmonic oscillators.
All the computations of physical eﬀects in quantum ﬁeld theory done by
physicists have been based on this general principle. It is the long-term de-
sire of physicists to replace this local approach by a more powerful global
approach. The harmonic oscillator and its relations to quantum ﬁeld theory
will be thoroughly studied in Volume II. At this point, let us only sketch the
basic ideas.
The classical harmonic oscillator and Poisson brackets. The New-
tonian equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator of mass m and coupling
constant κ > 0 on the real line reads as
m¨q(t) = −κq(t),
t ∈R.
(1.30)
This is the simplest oscillating system in physics. The equation of motion
(1.30) possesses the following general solution
q(t) =

ℏ
2mω (ae−iωt + a†eiωt),
t ∈R
(1.31)
along with the angular frequency ω :=

κ/m. The Fourier coeﬃcient a is
a complex number. Introducing the momentum p(t) := m ˙q(t) at time t, the
relations between the Fourier coeﬃcient a, the conjugate complex value a†,
and the initial values of the harmonic oscillator are given by
q(0) =

ℏ
2mω (a + a†),
p(0) = i

ℏmω
2
(a† −a).
(1.32)
The following three equivalent formulations were studied in the history of
classical mechanics.19
18 W. Heisenberg, Quantum-theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechan-
ical relations, Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik 33 (1925), 879–893. This paper founded
quantum mechanics. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1932.
19 A detailed investigation of the harmonic oscillator can be found in Volume II.

1.3 The Fundamental Role of the Harmonic Oscillator
47
(i) The Lagrangian approach: The function
L(q, ˙q) := 1
2m ˙q2 −1
2κq2
represents the Lagrangian of the harmonic oscillator. The Euler–Lagrange
equation ˙p = Lq is equivalent to the Newtonian equation (1.30). Along
each trajectory q = q(t) of the harmonic oscillator, we have energy con-
servation
E = p(t)2
2m + κq(t)2
2
for all
t ∈R.
(ii) The Hamiltonian approach: Introducing the Hamiltonian
H(q, p) := p2
2m + κq2
2 ,
the Newtonian equation (1.30) is equivalent to the following Hamiltonian
equations of motion
˙p = −Hq,
˙q = Hp.
(1.33)
This is also called canonical equation. Explicitly, ˙p(t) = −κq(t) and
˙q(t) = p(t)/m. We will show in Volume II that there is a symplectic
structure behind the Hamiltonian approach.
(iii) The Poissonian approach: Let us introduce the Poisson bracket
{A(q, p), B(q, p)} := AqBp −BqAp
where Aq denotes the partial derivative with respect to the variable q.
The Hamiltonian equations (1.33) of motion can then be written as
˙p = {p, H},
˙q = {q, H}.
(1.34)
This reveals the Poissonian structure behind classical mechanics. More-
over, we have
{q, p} = 1.
(1.35)
We will show below that the equations (1.34) and (1.35) are the key to the
quantization of the harmonic oscillator. This was discovered gradually by
Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, and Dirac in 1925/1926. Let us discuss this.
Heisenberg’s philosophical principle. In 1925 Heisenberg wanted to
understand atomic spectra. As a mathematical model, he considered the in-
ﬁnite scheme
q(t) = (qnmeiωnmt),
n, m = 1, 2, . . .

48
1. Historical Introduction
of angular frequencies ωnm and complex-valued amplitudes qnm. Following
Einstein and Bohr, Heisenberg postulated that the angular frequencies are
related to the possible energies of the system by the equation
ωnm = En −Em
ℏ
.
It was his goal to compute the energy levels E1, E2, . . . and the intensities of
the spectral lines which are proportional to the squares |qnm|2. To this end,
Heisenberg developed some simple rules for the scheme. Finally, he got the
crucial energy relation
En =
	
n + 1
2

ℏω,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
This was the birth of modern quantum mechanics. From the philosophical
point of view, Heisenberg did only use quantities which are directly related to
physical experiments in the spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. In particu-
lar, he did not use the notion of trajectory or velocity of a quantum particle.
In the same philosophical spirit, Heisenberg introduced the S-matrix in 1943;
this approach has been very successful in elementary particle physics.
Heisenberg did not know the mathematical notion of matrix. In fact, in his
1925 paper he invented matrix multiplication by using physical arguments.
When reading Heisenberg’s manuscript, Born remembered some course in
matrix calculus from the time of his studies; he conjectured that there should
hold the following commutation relation
q(t)p(t) −p(t)q(t) = iℏI
for all
t ∈R
(1.36)
with p(t) := m ˙q(t) = (imωnmqnmeiωnmt). Recall that the symbol I denotes
the identity operator. Born, himself, could prove (1.36) only for the diagonal
elements. The general proof was then obtained with the help of his young as-
sistant Pascual Jordan in G¨ottingen. For this historical reason, the commuta-
tion relation (1.36) will be called the Heisenberg–Born–Jordan commutation
relation in what follows.
The Heisenberg picture of the quantum harmonic oscillator and
Lie brackets. Let us now formulate Heisenberg’s approach to quantum me-
chanics in the manner polished by Born, Jordan, and Dirac. For the quantum
harmonic oscillator, the classical motion
q = q(t),
t ∈R
is replaced by the operator-valued function q = q(t). Moreover, in order
to obtain the equation of motion, we use the Poissonian approach, and we
replace the classical Poisson bracket by the Lie bracket. Explicitly,

iℏ[A, B]−
where [A, B]−:= AB −BA.20 From (1.34) and (1.35), we get the equations
of motion
iℏ˙p(t) = [p(t), H(t)]−,
iℏ˙q(t) = [q(t), H(t)]−,
(1.37)
and the commutation relation (1.36) along with the Hamiltonian
H(t) = p(t)2
2m + κq(t)2
2
.
It turns out that
This problem can be solved easily by using the classical solution (1.31)
and by replacing the Fourier coeﬃcient a by an operator. Here, we
have to assume that the operator a and its adjoint a† satisfy the
following commutation relation
[a, a†]−= I.
(1.38)
This method is called Fourier quantization. In Volume II, we will use this
method in order to obtain quantum electrodynamics as a quantum ﬁeld the-
ory which generalizes classical Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism.
The Schr¨odinger picture. The Schr¨odinger equation for the harmonic
oscillator reads as
iℏ˙ψ(x, t) = Hψ(x, t),
x, t ∈R
with the momentum operator (Pψ)(x, t) := −iℏψx(x, t), the position operator
(Qψ)(x, t) := xψ(x, t), and the Hamiltonian
H := P 2
2m + κQ2
2 .
Explicitly, the Schr¨odinger equation reads as
iℏ˙ψ(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m ψxx(x, t) + κ
2 x2ψ(x, t).
The ansatz ψ(x, t) = ϕ(x)e−iEt/ℏyields the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
Eϕ = Hϕ.
(1.39)
20 This general rule is due to Dirac. In 1928, Jordan and Wigner discovered that
one has to replace the commutator [A, B]−for bosons (e.g., photons) by the
anticommutator [A, B]+ := AB + BA in the case of fermions (e.g., electrons).

50
1. Historical Introduction
Explicitly, Eϕ(x) = −ℏ2
2mϕ′′(x) + κ
2 x2ϕ(x). This is an eigenvalue problem
for computing the unknown energy E. From classical analysis it is known
that the Hermite functions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . are eigenfunctions of (1.39). Let us use
the language of physicists in order to obtain these eigenfunctions in a very
elegant manner. Motivated by (1.32), we set p(0) := P, q(0) := Q, and hence
Q =

ℏ
2mω (a + a†),
P = i

ℏmω
2
(a† −a).
To simplify notation, let m = ω = ℏ= 1. This implies κ = 1. Then,
a =
1
√
2
(Q + iP),
a† =
1
√
2
(Q −iP).
It follows from the commutation relation [Q, P]−= iI that this choice of the
operator a satisﬁes the commutation relation (1.38). We will show in Volume
II, using only the commutation relations, that the functions
ϕn :=
1
√
n!
(a†)nϕ0,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with ϕ0(x) := c0e−x2/2 are eigensolutions of the equation
Enϕn = Hϕn,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with the eigenvalues En := (n + 1
2).21 If we choose the constant c0 := π−1/4,
then
⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩:=
 ∞
−∞
ϕn(x)†ϕm(x) dx = δnm,
n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .
In other words, the eigenfunctions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . form an orthonormal system in
the Hilbert space L2(R).22 For the original Schr¨odinger equation, we get the
solutions
ψn(x, t) = ϕn(x)e−iEnt/ℏ,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
which describe quantum oscillations of the quantum particle on the real line
with energy En = (n + 1
2)ℏω.
The Feynman picture. Using the eigenfunctions ψ0, ψ1, . . . , we can
construct the Feynman propagator kernel
P(x, t; y, t0) =
∞

n=0
ψn(x, t)ψn(y, t0)†.
21 This corresponds to En =
`
n + 1
2
´
ℏω when our simpliﬁcation ℏ= ω = m = 1
drops out.
22 In fact, it is shown in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 3.4 that this orthonormal
system is complete.

1.3 The Fundamental Role of the Harmonic Oscillator
51
This kernel knows all about the dynamics of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
In fact, suppose that we are given the wave function ψ(x, t0) := ϕ(x) at the
initial time t0. For arbitrary points x on the real line and arbitrary real time
t, the wave function is then given by the formula
ψ(x, t) =
 ∞
−∞
P(x, t; y, t0)ϕ(y)dy.
(1.40)
The fundamental role of Green’s functions in mathematics and
physics. In terms of physics, the Feynman propagator kernel P allows the
following intuitive interpretation. Choose the initial state
ϕ(x) := ϕ0δ(x −x0)
where ϕ0 is a ﬁxed complex number.23 Formally, this corresponds to an initial
state which is sharply concentrated at the point x0 at the initial time t0. By
(1.40), we get the solution
ψ(x, t) = ϕ0P(x, t; x0, t0)
for all positions x ∈R and all times t ≥t0. Thus, the Feynman propagator
describes the propagation of a sharply concentrated initial state. Formula
(1.40) tells us then that the general dynamics is the superposition of sharply
concentrated initial states ϕ(x0)δ(x −x0). This is the special case of a gen-
eral strategy in mathematics and physics called the strategy of the Green’s
function:
• Study ﬁrst the response of a given physical system under the action of
a sharply concentrated external force. This response corresponds to the
Green’s function of the system.
• The total response of the system under the action of a general external
force can then be described by the superposition of sharply concentrated
forces.
The response approach to quantum ﬁeld theory will be studied in Chap. 14.
The importance of Fock states in quantum ﬁeld theory. In the
example above, the states
ϕn :=
1
√
n!
(a†)nϕ0,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
span the Hilbert space L2(R). These states are called Fock states, and L2(R)
is called the corresponding Fock space. The state ϕ0 represents the ground
state, and we have
aϕ0 = 0.
23 The meaning of the Dirac delta function δ can be found on page 589.

52
1. Historical Introduction
Furthermore, for the operator N := a†a, we get
Nϕn = nϕn,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
In Chap. 15 we will generalize this model to quantum ﬁeld theory. Then, the
following will happen:
• The state ϕ0 passes over to the vacuum state |0⟩of a free quantum ﬁeld.
• The operator a† is called creation operator.
• The Fock state ϕn corresponds to a state which consists of n particles.
• Because aϕ0 = 0, the operator a is called annihilation operator.
• The Fock state ϕn is a common eigenstate of the energy operator H and
the particle number operator N with the eigenvalue n which counts the
number of particles of ϕn.
1.2.3 Quantum Fields and Second Quantization
Quantum ﬁeld theory was founded by Heisenberg and Pauli in 1929.24 From
the physical point of view the following is crucial:
A quantum ﬁeld can be treated as a system of an inﬁnite number
of quantum particles where creation and annihilation of particles are
possible.
In particular, for studying the radiation of atoms and molecules, one has
to consider the quantum ﬁeld of photons. In quantum electrodynamics, one
investigates the quantum ﬁeld of electrons, positrons, and photons.
The second quantization of the Schr¨odinger equation. As a pro-
totype, let us consider the quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the Schr¨odinger
equation. We will proceed in several steps.
• Step 1: Classical mechanics. We start with a classical particle on the real
line. The principle of critical action reads as
 t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t))dt = critical!
along with the boundary condition “q(t) = given” for t = t0, t1. This leads
to the Euler–Lagrange equation
d
dtL ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t)) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t))
which describes the motion, q = q(t), of the classical particle on the real
line.25 Let us consider the special case where
24 W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, On quantum ﬁeld theory (in German), Zeitschrift
f¨ur Physik 56 (1929), 1–61; 59 (1930), 108–190.
25 The derivation of the Euler–Lagrange equation in classical mechanics along with
symplectic and Poissonian geometry will be studied in Chaps. 4 and 5 of Vol. II.

1.3 The Fundamental Role of the Harmonic Oscillator
53
L(q, ˙q) := m ˙q2
2
−κU(q).
We deﬁne the momentum p := L ˙q and the Hamiltonian H := p ˙q−L. Hence
p = m ˙q, and
H = p2
2m + κU(q).
Set H(t) := p(t)2
2m + κU(q(t)). By energy conservation, we have
H(t) = H(0)
for all
t ∈R,
for each smooth solution q = q(t) of the Euler–Lagrange equation.
• Step 2: First quantization by using Heisenberg’s particle picture. We want
to describe a quantum particle on the real line.
To this end, we replace the classical trajectory q = q(t) by an operator-
valued function.
This implies the operators p(t) := m ˙q(t) and H(t) as given above. More
precisely, for each time t, we have the commutation relation
[q(t), p(t)]−= iℏI
and the following equations of motion26
iℏ˙q(t) = [q(t), H(t)]−,
iℏ˙p(t) = [p(t), H(t)]−.
We will show in Volume II that this implies the Newtonian equation of
motion m¨q(t) = −κU ′(q(t)). Furthermore, the energy operator H(t) does
not depend on time t. To simplify notation, this operator is denoted by the
symbol H.
• Step 3: First quantization by using Schr¨odinger’s wave picture. Here, the
quantum particle on the real line is described by the complex-valued wave
function ψ = ψ(x, t) which satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙ψ(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m ψxx(x, t) + κU(x)ψ(x, t).

First of all we want to derive the Schr¨odinger equation by the principle of
critical action of the form

along with the boundary condition “ψ(x, t) = given” on the boundary ∂Ω

tive with respect to time t. Each classical solution ψ = ψ(x, t) of (1.42)
satisﬁes the two Euler–Lagrange equations

Equation (1.43) is precisely the Schr¨odinger equation (1.41), whereas equa-
tion (1.44) is obtained from the Schr¨odinger equation by applying the op-
eration of complex conjugation, that is,
−iℏ˙ψ† = −ℏ2

Thus, equation (1.44) does not provide us any new information. Introduce
the momentum
π := L ˙ψ.
Explicitly, π(x, t) = iℏψ†(x, t). Moreover, we introduce the Hamiltonian
density
H := π ˙ψ −L
and the Hamiltonian H :=
 ∞
−∞Hdx. Explicitly,
H = ℏ2
2m ψ†
xψx + Uψ†ψ.
Here, H represents the energy of the classical ﬁeld ψ.
• Step 4: Second quantization of the Schr¨odinger equation and the quantum
ﬁeld. We now want to describe an inﬁnite number of quantum particles on
the real line including the creation and annihilation of particles.
To this end, we replace the classical wave function ψ = ψ(x, t) by an
operator-valued function.
More precisely, ψ(x, t) is an operator which, for all positions x, y ∈R and
all times t ∈R, satisﬁes the so-called canonical commutation relations
[ψ(x, t), π(y, t)]−= iℏδ(x −y),
[ψ(x, t), ψ(y, t)]−= [π(x, t), π(y, t)]−= 0
along with the equations of motion

iℏ˙ψ = [ψ, H]−,

It turns out that this implies the Schr¨odinger equation for the quantum
ﬁeld ψ = ψ(x, t).27

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

The classical ﬁeld ψ from (1.45) passes then over to a quantum ﬁeld which
consists of an inﬁnite number of particles having the energies E0, E1, . . . We
assume that there exists a state |0⟩which is free of particles. This state of
lowest energy E0 is called ground state (or vacuum).The symbol

represents a state at time t which is related to N free particles. Here, it is
important to distinguish between
• the ground state |0⟩of the free quantum ﬁeld ψfree without any interactions,
• and the ground state |0int⟩of the interacting quantum ﬁeld ψ.
The main trouble of quantum ﬁeld theories concerns the investigation of
interacting quantum ﬁelds in rigorous mathematical terms.

Commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators.
In elementary particle physics, we have to distinguish between bosons (parti-
cles of integer spin, e.g., photons) and fermions (particles of half-integer spin,
e.g., electrons). The prototype of commutation relations for annihilation op-
erators a(p) and creation operators a†(p) of bosonic particles of a momentum
vector p reads as 28

for all momentum vectors p, q which lie on a ﬁxed lattice of width ∆p in
3-dimensional momentum space. Here, we use the 3-dimensional Kronecker
symbol deﬁned by δpp := 1 and δpq = 0 if p ̸= q. Physicists pass to the
formal continuum limit. To consider this, let us rescale the annihilation and
creation operators by setting
a(p) :=
a(p)

(∆p)3 ,
a†(p) :=
a†(p)

(∆p)3 .

for all 3-dimensional momentum vectors p and q. The relation between the
discrete Dirac delta function and its continuum limit is studied on page 673.
The rigorous mathematical approach to creation and annihilation operators
for free quantum particles in terms of the so-called Fock space can be found
in Volume II.
The fundamental role of correlations of a quantum ﬁeld. The ex-
perience of physicists in quantum physics shows that one should prefer the
study of quantities which are related to measurements in physical experi-
ments. From the physical point of view, we can measure
• cross sections of scattering processes for elementary particles, and
• masses of bound particles (like the proton as a bound state of three quarks).
It turns out that these quantities are related to correlations between diﬀerent
space-time points of the quantum ﬁeld. According to Feynman, the basic
quantity is the correlation function
G2(x1, t1; x2, t2) := ⟨0int|T ψ(x1, t1)ψ†(x2, t2)|0int⟩
28 Recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA and [A, B]+ := AB + BA. For fermions, one
has to replace the Lie bracket [., .]−by the Jordan–Wigner bracket [., .]+.

1.3 The Fundamental Role of the Harmonic Oscillator
57
which is also called the 2-point Green’s function of the interacting quantum
ﬁeld ψ. This function describes the correlation between the quantum ﬁeld at
position x1 at time t1 and the quantum ﬁeld at position x2 and time t2. Here,
the symbol T denotes the chronological operator. Explicitly,
T (ψ(x1, t1)ψ†(x2, t2)) :=

ψ(x1, t1)ψ†(x2, t2)
if
t1 ≥t2,
ψ†(x2, t2)ψ(x1, t1)
if
t2 > t1.
It turns out that
The 2-point Green’s function G2 of a quantum ﬁeld is a highly sin-
gular mathematical object.
This fact causes serious mathematical diﬃculties. Similarly, the 2n-point
Green’s function is obtained by replacing the product ψ(x1, t1)ψ†(x2, t2) by
a product of 2n ﬁeld operators. For example, the 4-point Green’s function
G4 is given by
⟨0int|T ψ(x1, t1)ψ(x2, t2)ψ†(x3, t3)ψ†(x4, t4)|0int⟩.
The Green’s functions G2, G4, G6, . . . of a quantum ﬁeld are closely related
to the moments of the quantum ﬁeld which contain the information on the
probability structure of the quantum ﬁeld.
1.2.4 The Importance of Functional Integrals
The Feynman picture of quantum ﬁeld theory and the method of
moments. For quantum ﬁeld theory, it is crucial that the 2n-point Green’s
functions can be expressed by Feynman functional integrals (also called path
integrals). For example,
G2(x, t; y, s) =

ψ(x, t)ψ†(y, s)eiS[ψ,ψ†]/ℏDψ Dψ†
 eiS[ψ,ψ†]/ℏDψ Dψ†
where we integrate over all possible classical ﬁelds ψ, ψ†. In this connection,
we use the classical action
S[ψ, ψ†] :=

R2 L dxdt
where the Lagrangian density L depends on ψ, ψ†, and their ﬁrst-order partial
derivatives. The crucial point is that the formula for G2 makes also sense if
the Lagrangian L contains nonlinear terms in ψ and ψ† which describe self-
interactions of the quantum ﬁeld. For example, we may replace the potential
U by the ﬁeld product ψ†ψ. Then
L := iℏψ† ˙ψ −ℏ2
2mψ†
xψx −κ(ψ†)2ψ2.

The relation to the Gaussian distribution in the theory of prob-
ability. For k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the quantity
Mk :=

R xke−x2/2σ2dx

R e−x2/2σ2dx
is called the kth moment of the Gaussian distribution in the theory of proba-
bility. By the classical moment theorem, a probability distribution is uniquely
determined by its inﬁnite series M0, M1, M2, . . . of moments.29 There exists
the following simple trick for computing the moments. We introduce the
function
Z(J) := C

R
e−x2/2σ2 eJx dx
of the real variable J where the normalization constant C is chosen in such a
way that Z(0) = 1. Then, for k = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
Mk = dkZ(0)
dJk
.
Naturally enough, the function Z = Z(J) is called the generating function
of the moments. Physicists call this the Wick moment trick. It is quite re-
markable that the investigation of general interacting quantum ﬁelds can be
based on an inﬁnite-dimensional version of the Wick trick. The point is that
classical integrals have to be replaced by Feynman functional integrals. Here,
physicists start with the so-called generating functional integral
Z(J, J†) = C

eiS[ψ,ψ†]/ℏe
R
R2(ψJ+ψ†J†)dxdt Dψ Dψ†
where the normalization C is chosen in such a way that Z(0, 0) = 1. Then
G2(x, t; y, s) =
	ℏ
i

2
δ2Z(0, 0)
δJ(x, t)δJ†(y, s).
Analogously, one obtains the higher-order Green’s functions by applying func-
tional derivatives of higher order. The precise deﬁnition of functional deriva-
tives can be found in Sect. 7.20.1 on page 396. Note that
Functional derivatives and functional integrals are natural general-
izations of classical partial derivatives and classical multidimensional
integrals to inﬁnite dimensions, respectively.
They have been used systematically by physicists in the 20th century in order
to generalize the classical calculus due to Newton and Leibniz to an inﬁnite
number of degrees of freedom which appear typically in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Fig. 1.3. Virtual particles
The Feynman approach to interacting quantum ﬁelds can be based on
the moments of “inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian distributions”.
This will be thoroughly studied in the volumes of this treatise.
Virtual particles. It turns out that the Feynman diagrams from Fig.
1.2 on page 41 can be generalized to quantum ﬁelds. Fig. 1.3 displays some
Feynman diagrams which describe the scattering of one electron with one
photon (Compton eﬀect). The diagrams are nothing more than a graphical
representation of the analytic expressions of perturbation theory. If one gives
the diagrams a physical interpretation, then there occur, for example, photons
for which the physical relation
E2 = c2p2
between energy E and momentum vector p is violated. Such particles are
called virtual photons by physicists.30 Without using virtual particles, the
computation of scattering processes would give wrong results. This shows
that
The interactions between quantum ﬁelds are based on both real and
virtual particles.
The Bethe–Salpeter equation for bound states. The state
ψ†(x, t)ψ†(y, s)|0int⟩
of the quantum ﬁeld ψ describes the physics of systems consisting of two quan-
tum particles. In particular, we expect that this state also contains bound
states between two particles. Let |p⟩denote a one-particle state of momentum
p. In 1951 Bethe and Salpeter used the so-called Bethe amplitudes
χp(x, t; y, s) := ⟨0int|T ψ(x, t)ψ†(y, s)|p⟩
in order to derive an integral equation for χp which contains the unknown
energy E of the bound state as an eigenvalue parameter. This is the famous

quantum electrodynamics.

1.3 The Role of G¨ottingen
One cannot comprehend what it is one possesses if one has not understood
what one’s predecessors possessed.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832)
I am ill-mannered, for I take a lively interest in a mathematical object
only where I see a prospect of a clever connection of ideas or of results
recommended by elegance or generality.
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
In 1807, Carl Friedrich Gauss got the position as professor for astronomy and
director of the observatory in G¨ottingen. His successors were Lejeune Dirich-
let (1805–1859) and Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) in G¨ottingen. In 1871,
Felix Klein (1849–1925) ﬁnished his habilitation in G¨ottingen. After that he
received professorships in Erlangen, Munich, and Leipzig. In 1881 he founded
the Mathematical Institute of Leipzig University. After his move to G¨ottingen
in 1886, Sophus Lie (1842–1899) became Klein’s successor in Leipzig. Initi-
ated by Klein, Hilbert received a professorship at G¨ottingen University in
1895. Under Hilbert, G¨ottingen became an extremely active place in math-
ematics. In the 1920s, Emmy Noether (1882–1935) revolutionized algebra
in G¨ottingen. The young mathematician Bartel Leendert van der Waerden
(1903–1996) attended the lectures given by Emmy Noether and Emil Artin.
The result was his highly inﬂuential monograph Modern Algebra, Springer,
Berlin 1930.
The emergence of quantum mechanics. In the late 1920s, G¨ottingen
was the intellectual center for the development of the new quantum physics
by Heisenberg (1901–1976), Born (1882–1970), Jordan (1902–1980), Pauli
(1900–1958), and von Neumann (1903–1957). Students and scientists from all
over the world came to G¨ottingen in order to take part in this scientiﬁc rev-
olution. Among the visitors were the young physicists Vladimir Fock (1890–
1974), Lev Landau (1908–1968), and Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967). In
order to get an impression of the ﬂair of the early days of quantum me-
chanics, let us ﬁrst quote Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) and Paul Dirac
(1902–1984) who gave Evening Lectures at the International Center for The-
oretical Physics in Trieste (Italy) in 1968. They were invited by Abdus Salam
(1926–1996).32 Heisenberg pointed out the following:
31 See Bethe and Salpeter (1957), Itzykson and Zuber (1981), Sect. 10.2, and Gross
(1993), Sect. 12.5.
32 A. Salam (Ed.) (1968). The author would like to thank Professor Armin Uhlmann
(Leipzig) for drawing his attention to these beautiful “Evening Lectures”. The
history of quantum physics can be found in J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg (2002),

1.3 The Role of G¨ottingen
61
I had the impression from my conversation with Bohr (1885–1962) that
one should go away from all these classical concepts, one should not speak
of the orbit of an electron. . .
When I came back from Copenhagen to G¨ottingen I decided that I should
again try to do some kind of guess work there, namely, to guess the in-
tensities in the hydrogen spectrum. . . That was early in the summer 1925
and I failed completely. The formulae got too complicated. . . At the same
time I also felt, if the mechanical system would be simpler, then it might
be possible just to do the same thing as Kramers (1894–1952) and I had
done in Copenhagen and to guess the amplitudes. Therefore I turned from
the hydrogen atom to the anharmonic oscillator, which was a very sim-
ple model. Just then I became ill and went to the island of Heligoland
to recover. There I had plenty of time to do my calculations. It turned
out that it really was quite simple to translate classical mechanics into
quantum mechanics. But I should mention one important point. It was
not suﬃcient simply to say “let us take some frequencies and amplitudes
to replace orbit quantities” and use a kind of multiplication which we had
already used in Copenhagen and which later turned out to be equivalent
to matrix multiplication. . .
It turned out that one could replace the quantum conditions of Bohr’s
theory by a formula which was essentially equivalent to the sum-rule by
Thomas and Kuhn. . . I was however not able to get a neat mathematical
scheme out of it. Very soon afterwards both Born and Jordan in G¨ottingen
and Dirac in Cambridge were able to invent a perfectly closed mathemat-
ical scheme; Dirac with very ingenious new methods on q-numbers and
Born and Jordan with more conventional methods of matrices33. . .
When you try too much for rigorous mathematical methods you ﬁx your
attention on those points which are not important from the physics point
and thereby you get away from the experimental situation. If you try to
solve a problem by rather dirty mathematics, as I have mostly done, then
you are forced always to think of the experimental situation; and whatever
formulae you write down, you try to compare the formulae with reality and
thereby, somehow, you get closer to reality than by looking for the rigorous
methods. But this may, of course, be diﬀerent for diﬀerent people. . .
In 1926 Niels Bohr and I discussed the question on the physical interpre-
tation of quantum mechanics many, many nights and we were frequently
in a state of despair. Bohr tried more in the direction of duality between
waves and particles; I preferred to start from the mathematical formalism
and to look for a consistent interpretation. Finally Bohr went to Norway
to think alone about the problem and I remained in Copenhagen. Then I
remembered Einstein’s remark in our discussion. I remembered that Ein-
stein had said that “It is the theory which decides what can be observed.”
From there it was easy to turn around our question and not to ask “How
can I represent in quantum mechanics this orbit of an electron in a cloud
Vols. 1–6. As an introduction to the development of quantum mechanics in the
1920s, we recommend van der Waerden (1968). For the history of quantum ﬁeld
theory, we refer to Schweber (1994) and Weinberg (1995), Vol. 1, Chap. 1.
33 Dirac’s q-numbers (quantum numbers) are abstract operators in the sense of
modern functional analysis, whereas Born and Jordan used concrete realizations
of the operators in the form of inﬁnite-dimensional complex matrices.

1. Historical Introduction
chamber?”, but rather to ask “Is it not true that always only such situa-
tions occur in nature, even in a cloud chamber, which can be described by
the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics?” By turning around
I had to investigate what can be described in this formalism; and then it
was very easily seen, especially when one used the new mathematical dis-
coveries of Dirac and Jordan about transformation theory, that one could
not describe at the same time the exact position and the exact velocity of
an electron; one had these uncertainty relations. In this way things became
clear. When Bohr returned to Copenhagen, he had found an equivalent in-
terpretation with his concept of complementarity, so ﬁnally we all agreed
that now we had understood quantum theory. . .
Again we met a diﬃcult situation in 1927 when Einstein and Bohr dis-
cussed these matters at the Solvay Conference. Almost every day the se-
quence of events was the following. We all lived in the same hotel. In the
morning for breakfast Einstein would appear and tell Bohr a new ﬁcti-
tious experiment in which he could disprove the uncertainty relations and
thereby our interpretation of quantum theory. Then Bohr, Pauli and I
would be very worried, we would follow Bohr and Einstein to the meeting
and would discuss this problem all day. But at night for dinner usually
Bohr had solved the problem and he gave the answer to Einstein, so then
we felt that everything was alright and Einstein was a bit sorry about that
and said he would think about it. Next morning he would bring a new
ﬁctitious experiment, again we had to discuss, and so on. This went on for
quite a number of days and at the end of the conference the Copenhagen
physicists had the feeling that they had won the battle and that actually
Einstein could not make any real objection. . . Einstein never accepted the
probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. He said :“God does not
play at dice.”
Dirac emphasized the following in his Evening Lecture at Trieste:
I have the best of reasons for being an admirer of Werner Heisenberg.
He and I were young research students at the same time, about the same
age, working on the same problem. Heisenberg succeeded where I failed.
There was a large mass of spectroscopic data accumulated at that time
and Heisenberg found out the proper way of handling it. In doing so, he
started the golden age of theoretical physics. . .
One can distinguish between two main procedures for a theoretical physi-
cist. One of them is to work from the experimental basis. For this, one must
keep in close touch with the experimental physicists. One reads about all
the results they obtain and tries to ﬁt them into a comprehensive and
satisfying scheme.
The other procedure is to work from the mathematical basis. One examines
and criticizes the existing theory. One tries to pin-point the faults in it
and then tries to remove them. The diﬃculty here is to remove the faults
without destroying the very great success of the existing theory. . .
This is illustrated by the discovery of quantum mechanics. Two men are
involved, Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger. Heisenberg was working from the
experimental basis, using the results of spectroscopy, which by 1925 had
accumulated an enormous amount of data. . . It was Heisenberg’s genius
that he was able to pick out the important things from the great wealth

1.3 The Role of G¨ottingen
63
of information and arrange them in a natural scheme. He was thus led to
matrices. . .
Schr¨odinger’s approach was quite diﬀerent. He worked from the mathemat-
ical basis. He was not well informed about the latest spectroscopic results,
like Heisenberg was, but had the idea at the back of his mind that spectral
frequencies should be ﬁxed by eigenvalue equations, something like those
that ﬁx the frequencies of systems of vibrating strings. He had this idea
for a long time, and was eventually able to ﬁnd the right equation, in an
indirect way. . .
Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger gave us two forms of quantum mechanics,
which were soon found to be equivalent. They provided two pictures, with
a certain mathematical transformation connecting them. I joined in the
early work on quantum mechanics, following the procedure based on math-
ematics, with a very abstract point of view. I took the noncommutative
algebra which was suggested by Heisenberg’s matrices as the main feature
for a new dynamics. . .
The following quotation is taken from Max Born’s fascinating book Physics
in my Generation, Springer, New York, 1969:
In G¨ottingen we also took part in the attempts to distill the unknown
mechanics of the atom out of the experimental results. The logical diﬃ-
culty became ever more acute. Investigations on scattering and dispersions
of light showed that Einstein’s conception of transition probability as a
measure of the strength of an oscillation was not adequate. . . The art of
guessing correct formulas, which depart from the classical formulas but
pass over into them in the sense of Bohr’s correspondence principle, was
brought to considerable perfection. . .
This period was brought to a sudden end by Heisenberg, who was my
assistant at that time. He cut the Gordian knot by a philosophical principle
and replaced guesswork by a mathematical rule. The principle asserts that
concepts and pictures that do not correspond to physically observable facts
should not be used in theoretical description. When Einstein, in setting up
his theory of relativity, eliminated his concepts of the absolute velocity of
a body and of the absolute simultaneity of two events at diﬀerent places,
he was making use of the same principle. Heisenberg banished the picture
of electron orbits with deﬁnite radii and periods of rotation, because these
quantities are not observable; he demanded that the theory should be built
up by means of quadratic arrays. Instead of describing the motion by giving
a coordinate as a function of time x = x(t), one ought to determine an
array of transition probabilities (xij). To me the decisive part in his work
is the requirement that one must ﬁnd a rule whereby from a given array

the array for the square (x2)ij may be found (or, in general, the multipli-
cation law of such arrays).
By consideration of known examples discovered by guesswork, Heisenberg
found this rule and applied it with success to simple examples such as

the harmonic and anharmonic oscillator. This was in the summer 1925.
Heisenberg, suﬀering from a severe attack of hay fever, took leave of ab-
sence for a course of treatment at the seaside and handed over his paper
to me for publication, if I thought I could do anything about it.
The signiﬁcance of the idea was immediately clear to me, and I sent the
manuscript to the publisher.34 Heisenberg’s rule of multiplication left me
no peace, and after a week of intensive thought and trial, I suddenly
remembered an algebraic theory that I had learned from my teacher,
Rosanes, in Breslau. Such quadratic arrays are quite familiar to mathe-
maticians and are called matrices, in association with a deﬁnite rule of
multiplication. I applied this rule to Heisenberg’s quantum condition and
found that it agreed for the diagonal elements. It was easy to guess what
the remaining elements must be, namely, null; and immediately there stood
before me the strange formula
qp −pq = iℏ.
(1.46)
This meant that the coordinates q and momenta p are not to be represented
by the values of numbers but by symbols whose product depends on the
order of multiplication – which do not “commute”, as we say.
My excitement over this result was like that of the mariner who, after
long voyaging, sees the desired land from afar, and my only regret was
that Heisenberg was not with me. I was convinced from the ﬁrst that we
had stumbled on the truth. Yet again a large part was only guesswork, in
particular the vanishing of the non-diagonal elements in the foregoing ex-
pression. For this problem, I secured the collaboration of my pupil Pascual
Jordan, and in a few days we succeeded in showing that I had guessed
correctly. The joint paper written by Jordan and myself35 contains the
most important principles of quantum mechanics, including its extension
to electrodynamics. . .
There followed a hectic period of collaboration among the three of us,
rendered diﬃcult by Heisenberg’s absence. There was a lively interchange
of letters. . . The result was a three-man paper,36 which brought the formal
side of the investigation to a certain degree of completeness. Before this
paper appeared, the ﬁrst dramatic surprise occurred: Paul Dirac’s paper on
the same subject.37 The stimulus received through a lecture by Heisenberg
in Cambridge led him to results similar to ours in G¨ottingen, with the
diﬀerence that he did not have recourse to the known matrix theory of the
mathematicians but discovered for himself and elaborated the doctrine of
such non-commuting symbols.

1.3 The Role of G¨ottingen
65
The ﬁrst nontrivial and physically important application of quantum me-
chanics was made soon afterwards by Wolfgang Pauli,38 who calculated
the stationary energy values of the hydrogen atom by the matrix method
and found complete agreement with Bohr’s 1913 formulas. From this mo-
ment there was no longer any doubt about the correctness of the theory
among physicists. . .
What the real signiﬁcance of the formalism might be was, however, by
no means clear. Mathematics, as often happens, was wiser than interpre-
tative thought. While we were still discussing the point, there occurred
the second dramatic surprise: the appearance of Schr¨odinger’s celebrated
paper.39 He followed quite a diﬀerent line of thought, which derived from
Prince Louis de Broglie (1892–1987). The latter had a few years previ-
ously made the bold assertion, supported by brilliant theoretical consid-
erations, that wave-corpuscle dualism, familiar to physicists in the case of
light, must also be exhibited by electrons; to each freely movable electron
there belongs, according to these ideas, a plane wave of perfectly deﬁnite
wave length, determined by Planck’s constant and mass. . . Schr¨odinger
extended de Broglie’s wave equation, which applied to free motion, to the
case in which forces act. . . and he succeeded in deriving the stationary
states of the hydrogen atom as monochromatic solutions of his wave equa-
tion not extending to inﬁnity. For a short while, at the beginning of 1926,
it looked as if suddenly there were two self-contained but entirely distinct
systems of explanation in the ﬁeld – matrix mechanics and wave mechanics.
But Schr¨odinger himself soon demonstrated their complete equivalence.
Wave mechanics enjoyed much greater popularity than the G¨ottingen or
Cambridge version of quantum mechanics. Wave mechanics operates with
a wave function ψ, which – at least in the case of one particle – can be
pictured in space, and it employs the mathematical methods of partial
diﬀerential equations familiar to every physicist.
It appeared to me that it was not possible to arrive at a clear interpreta-
tion of the Schr¨odinger ψ-function by considering bound electrons. I had
therefore been at pains, as early as the end of 1925. . . I was at that time
the guest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S.A., and
there I found in Norbert Wiener (1894–1964) a distinguished collaborator.
In a joint 1926 paper we replaced the matrix by the general concept of an
operator and, in this way, made possible the description of aperiodic pro-
cesses. . . Once more an idea of Einstein’s gave the lead. He had thought
to make the duality of particles (light quanta or photons) and waves com-
prehensible by interpreting the square of the optical wave amplitudes as
probability density for the occurrence of photons. This idea could at once
be extended to Schr¨odinger’s ψ-function:
The square of the amplitude, |ψ|2, must represent the probability
density for electrons (or other particles).
To assert this was easy; but how could I prove this? For this purpose atomic
scattering processes suggested themselves. A shower of electrons coming
from an inﬁnite distance, represented by a wave of known intensity (that

is, |ψ|2) impinge on an obstacle say a heavy atom. . . In the same way
that the water wave caused by a steamer excites secondary circular waves
in striking a pile, the incident electron wave is partly transformed by the
atom into a secondary spherical wave, whose amplitude of oscillations ψ
is diﬀerent in diﬀerent directions. The square of the amplitude |ψ|2 of this
wave at a great distance from the scattering center then determines the
relative probability of scattering in its dependence of direction. . . Soon
Wentzel succeeded in deriving Rutherford’s celebrated 1911 formula for
the scattering of α-particles from my theory.
But the factor that contributed more than these successes to the speed of
acceptance of my statistical interpretation of the ψ-function was a 1927
paper by Heisenberg that contained his celebrated uncertainty relationship,
through which the revolutionary character of the new conception was ﬁrst
made clear.
In 1927 Heisenberg left G¨ottingen in order to get a professorship at Leipzig
University. Four years later, van der Waerden came to Leipzig as a professor
of mathematics. According to his own words, he liked very much to attend
Heisenberg’s seminars. In 1932 van der Waerden published his nicely written
book Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics about applications of group
theory to the spectra of non-relativistic molecules and Dirac’s relativistic
electron.
The challenge of quantum electrodynamics. Already in the early
days of quantum mechanics, physicists tried to understand the quantization
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Heisenberg and Pauli published two fundamental
papers in 1929 and 1930.40 Quantum electrodynamics was fully developed in
the late 1940s. In order to handle meaningless inﬁnite expressions, physicists
developed the method of renormalization in the 1930s and 1940s. This inge-
nious method allows physicists to extract the relevant physical information
from mathematically meaningless expressions. We will thoroughly study this
important point later on. From the physical point of view, the following is
crucial:
• The singularities of the Green’s functions reﬂect both the complicated
structure of the ground state of a quantum ﬁeld and the complex interac-
tions between the unobservable ground state and the real world, by means
of quantum ﬂuctuations.
• The renormalization procedure indicates that the present quantum ﬁeld
theory is not a basic theory, but only an eﬀective theory which averages a
deeper physical structure, at a fairly low energy scale.
In 1965, Julian Schwinger said in his Nobel prize speech:
The relativistic quantum theory of ﬁelds was born some thirty-ﬁve years
ago through the paternal eﬀorts of Dirac, Heisenberg, Pauli and others. It
was a somewhat retarded youngster, however, and ﬁrst reached adolescence
seventeen years later, an event we are gathered here to celebrate.

1.4 The G¨ottingen Tragedy

1.4 The G¨ottingen Tragedy
Wistfully I recall how, during the Nazi occupation of Poland (1939–1945),
Edward Marczewski introduced the arcana of analysis to me. In those dark
days these were for me bright moments, for which I am inﬁnitely grateful
to him.
Krysztof Maurin (born 1923)
In 1933 the Nazi regime reached the political power in Germany. Be-
cause of racist repression, the best scientists left Germany, among them
Emmy Noether (1882–1935), Emil Artin (1898–1972), Paul Bernays (1888–
1977), Max Born (1882–1970), Richard Courant (1882–1972), Albert Einstein
(1879–1955), Kurt-Otto Friedrichs (1901–1982), Leon Lichtenstein (1878–
1933), John von Neumann (1903–1957), and Hermann Weyl (1885–1955).
Furthermore, Edmund Landau (1877–1938) and the Nobel laureate James
Franck (1884–1964) lost their positions at G¨ottingen University. Hilbert’s
best friend, Otto Blumenthal (1876–1944), was murdered in the Nazi con-
centration camp Tere˘zin (Theresienstadt). In 1934 Hilbert was asked by the
Nazi minister of education about the ﬂourishing scientiﬁc life in G¨ottingen.
Hilbert answered:
There is no mathematics anymore in G¨ottingen.
The G¨ottingen tradition moved to the United States of America. Richard
Courant founded the famous Courant Institute at New York University
(NYU). In this context, we recommend reading the two beautiful biographies
about David Hilbert and Richard Courant written by Constance Reid.41
After working as professor in Zurich and Prague, Einstein was appointed
as director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin in 1914.
In 1933 Einstein emigrated to the United States of America where he got
a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.42
Einstein lived there until his death in 1955. As Einstein did, John von Neu-
mann left Germany in 1933 and moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, too. Von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematicians of the
20th century. His fundamental contributions concern game theory, mathemat-
ical economics, mathematical logic, lattice theory, operator theory in Hilbert
spaces, operator algebras, mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics,
theory of Lie groups, measure theory, statistical physics, ergodic theory, con-
struction of the ﬁrst computers ENIAC and MANIAC, and foundations of
computer science in the 1940s, shock waves, turbulence, meteorology, and

1. Historical Introduction
numerical mathematics. In the context with John von Neumann, let us quote
Peter Hilton.43
For a mentor of Ph.D. candidates it would be most easy to educate a poor
applied mathematician. The next simplest thing would be to educate a
poor pure mathematician. Then an entire quantum gap lies between the
education of a good pure mathematician, and ﬁnally, an enormous quan-
tum gap, the education of a good applied mathematician. For the latter
task, especially after the death of John von Neumann, I would consider no
one suﬃciently qualiﬁed.
The knowledge and abilities which are nowadays required of a really suc-
cessful applied mathematician, presume an extraordinary high intellectual
standard, and, even for the career of our present-day students, it is almost
impossible to predict which parts of mathematics will prove most suited
for applications.
Besides John von Neumann, another hero of the 20th century mathematics is
Hermann Weyl. He studied mathematics in G¨ottingen from 1903 until 1908.
He attended lectures given by Carath´eodory (1873–1950), Hilbert (1858–
1943), Klein (1849–1925), Koebe (1882–1945), and Zermelo (1871–1953). He
was Hilbert’s most gifted pupil. From 1913 until 1930, Weyl worked at the
Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. In 1930 he became Hilbert’s
successor at G¨ottingen University. Three years later, Hermann Weyl left Ger-
many and joined Einstein and von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton. Hermann Weyl inﬂuenced very strongly the relations be-
tween mathematics and physics. He wrote a number of classical monographs
about Riemann surfaces, theory of general relativity, group theory and quan-
tum mechanics, representation theory of the classical Lie groups, symmetry,
and philosophical questions. His books became bibles for both physicists and
mathematicians. In particular, the idea of gauge ﬁeld theory can be traced
back to Weyl’s monograph Space, Time, Matter from 1923 where he presented
Einstein’s theory of general relativity along with his own ideas about a gen-
eral theory of matter, based on scaling invariance and the conformal group.
In 1944 Hermann Weyl wrote the following in the Bulletin of the American
Mathematical Society:
A great master of mathematics passed away when Hilbert died in G¨ottingen
on February 14, 1943, at the age of eighty-one. In retrospect, it seems to
us that the era of mathematics upon which he impressed the seal of his
spirit, and which is now sinking below the horizon, achieved a more per-
fect balance than has prevailed before or since, between the mastering of
single concrete problems and the formation of general abstract concepts.
Hilbert’s own work contributed not a little to bringing about this happy
equilibrium, and the direction we have since proceeded can in many in-
stances be traced back to this impulse. No mathematician of equal stature
has arisen from our generation. . .
Hilbert was singularly free from national and racial prejudice; in all public
questions, be they political, social, or spiritual, he stood forever on the side

of freedom, frequently in isolated opposition against the compact majority
of his environment. . . It was not mere chance, when the Nazis “purged”
the universities in 1933 and their hand fell most heavily on the Hilbert
school that Hilbert’s most intimate collaborators left Germany voluntarily
or under the pressure of Nazi persecution. He himself was too old, and
stayed behind; but the years after 1933 became years of ever-deepening
tragic loneliness.

1.5.2 The Fields Medal in Mathematics
The International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) takes place every four
years. In 1924, a resolution was adopted that at each ICM, two gold medals
should be awarded to recognize outstanding mathematical achievement. Pro-
fessor J. C. Fields, a Canadian mathematician who was secretary of the 1924
Congress, later donated funds establishing the medals which were named in
his honor. Consistent with Field’s wish that the awards recognize both exist-
ing work and the promise of future achievement, it was agreed to restrict the
medal to mathematicians not over forty in the year of the congress. In 1966
it was agreed, because of great extension of mathematical research, up to
four medals could be awarded at each Congress. The following list of Fields

1.6 The Emergence of Physical Mathematics – a New
Dimension of Mathematics
At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto in 1990, the young
physicist Edward Witten (Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton) was
awarded the Fields medal in mathematics. In his laudation for Edward Wit-
ten, Sir Michael Atiyah emphasized the following:47
The past decade has seen a remarkable renaissance in the interaction be-
tween mathematics and physics. This has been mainly due to the increas-
ingly sophisticated mathematical models employed by elementary particle
physicists, and the consequent need to use the appropriate mathematical
machinery. In particular, because of the strongly non-linear nature of the
theories involved, topological ideas and methods have played a prominent
part.
The mathematical community has beneﬁted from this interaction in two
ways. First, and more conventionally, mathematicians have been spurred
into learning some of the relevant physics and collaborating with colleagues
in theoretical physics. Second, and more surprisingly, many of the ideas
emanating from physics have led to signiﬁcant new insights in purely math-
ematical problems, and remarkable discoveries have been made in conse-
quence. The main input from physics has come from quantum ﬁeld theory.
While the analytic foundations of quantum ﬁeld theory have been inten-
sively studied by mathematicians for many years, the new stimulus has
involved the more formal (algebraic, geometric, topological) aspects.
In all this large and exciting ﬁeld, which involves many of the leading physi-
cists and mathematicians in the world, Edward Witten stands clearly as
the most inﬂuential and dominating ﬁgure. Although he is deﬁnitely a
physicist his command of mathematics is rivalled by few mathematicians,
and his ability to interpret physical ideas in mathematical form is quite
unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community by
a brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathe-
matical theorems.

1. Historical Introduction
In 1986, the American Mathematical Society invited mathematicians and
physicists to a joined symposium devoted to Mathematics: the Unifying
Thread in Science. In his quite remarkable speech, the physicist Steven Wein-
berg pointed out the following.48
String theory is right now the hot topic of theoretical physics. According
to this picture, the fundamental constituents of nature are not, in fact,
particles, or even ﬁelds, but are instead little strings, little elementary
rubber bands that go zipping around, each in its own state of vibration.
In these theories what we call a particle is just a string in a particular
state of vibration, and what we call a reaction among particles, is just
the collision of two or more strings, each in its own state of vibration,
forming a single joined string which then later breaks up, forming several
independent strings, each again in its own mode of vibration.
It seems like a strange notion for physicists to have come to after all these
years of talking about particles and ﬁelds, and it would take too long to
explain why we think this is not an unreasonable picture of nature, but
perhaps I can summarize it in one sentence:
String theories incorporate gravitation.
In fact, not only do they incorporate it, you cannot have a string theory
without gravitation. The graviton, the quantum of gravitational radiation,
the particle which is transmitted when a gravitational force is exerted
between two masses, is just the lowest mode of vibration of a fundamental
closed string (closed meaning that it is a loop). Not only do they include
and necessitate gravitation, but these string theories for the ﬁrst time allow
a description of gravitation on a microscopic quantum level which is free
of mathematical inconsistencies.
All other descriptions of gravity broke down mathematically, gave nonsen-
sical results when carried to very small distances or very high energies.
String theory is our ﬁrst chance at a reasonable theory of gravity which
extends from the very large down to very small and as such, it is natural
that we are all agog over it. String theory itself has focused the attention
of physicists on branches of mathematics that most of us weren’t fortunate
enough to have learned when we were students. You can easily see that a
string (just think of a little bit of cord) travelling through space, sweeps
out a two-dimensional surface.
A very convenient description of string theory is to say that it is
the theory of these two-dimensional Riemann surfaces.
The theory of two-dimensional surfaces is remarkably beautiful. There are
ways of classifying all possible two-dimensional surfaces according to their
handles on them and the number of boundaries, which simply don’t exist in
any higher dimension. The theory of two-dimensional surfaces is a branch
of mathematics that when you get into it is one of the loveliest things you
can learn. It was developed in the 19th century, starting with Riemann,
48 Notices Amer. Math. Soc. 33 (1986), 716–733 (reprinted with permission). For
his fundamental contributions to the theory of the uniﬁed weak and electromag-
netic interaction between elementary particles, Steven Weinberg was awarded
the Nobel prize in physics in 1979. He wrote the standard textbook of modern
quantum ﬁeld theory, S. Weinberg, Quantum Field Theory, Vols. 1–3, Cambridge
University Press.

1.7 The Seven Millennium Prize Problems
77
and further developed by mathematicians working in the late 19th century
motivated by problems in complex analysis, and then continuing into the
20th century.
There are mathematicians who have spent their whole lives working on
this theory of two-dimensional surfaces, who have never heard of string
theory (or at least not until very recently). Yet when the physicists started
to ﬁgure out how to solve the dynamical problems of strings, and they
realized what they had to do was to perform sums49 over all possible two-
dimensional surfaces in order to add up all the ways that reactions could
occur, they found the mathematics just ready for their use, developed over
the past 100 years.
String theory involves another branch of mathematics which goes back to
group theory.
The equations which govern these surfaces have a very large group
of symmetries, known as the conformal group.
One description of these symmetries is in terms of an algebraic structure
representing all the possible group transformations, which is actually inﬁ-
nite dimensional. Mathematicians have been doing a lot of work developing
the theory of these inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras which underlie sym-
metry groups, again without a clear motivation in terms of physics, and
certainly without knowing anything about string theory. Yet when the
physicists started to work on it, there it was.
Speaking quite personally, I have found it exhilarating at my stage of life to
have to go back to school and learn all this wonderful mathematics. Some
of us physicists have enjoyed our conversations with mathematicians, in
which
We beg them to explain things to us in terms we can understand.
At the same time the mathematicians are pleased and somewhat bemused
that we are paying attention to them after all these years. The mathematics
department of the University of Texas at Austin now allows the physicists
to use one of their lounges – which would have been unlikely in previous
years.
Unfortunately, I must admit that there is no experimental evidence yet
for string theory, and so, if theoretical physicists are spending more time
talking to the mathematicians, they are spending less time talking to the
experimentalists, which is not good.
1.7 The Seven Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay

1. Historical Introduction
“Amphith´eatre” of the Coll`ege de France, on May 24, 2000. The Scientiﬁc
Advisory Board of the newly founded Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI)
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., selected seven Millennium prize prob-
lems. The Scientiﬁc Advisory Board consists of Arthur Jaﬀe (director of the
CMI, Harvard University, U.S.A), Alain Connes (Institut des Hautes ´Etudes
Scientiﬁques (IH´ES) and Coll`ege de France), Andrew Wiles (Princeton Uni-
versity, U.S.A.), and Edward Witten (Institute for Advanced Study, Prince-
ton, U.S.A.). The CMI explains its intention as follows:
Mathematics occupies a privileged place among the sciences. It embodies
the quintessence of human knowledge, reaching into every ﬁeld of human
endeavor. The frontiers of mathematical understanding evolve today in
deep and unfathomable ways. Fundamental advances go hand in hand with
discoveries in all ﬁelds of science. Technological applications of mathemat-
ics underpin our daily life, including our ability to communicate thanks
to cryptology and coding theory, our ability to navigate and to travel, our
health and well-being, our security, and they also play a central role in our
economy. The evolution of mathematics will remain a central tool to shap-
ing civilization. To appreciate the scope of mathematical truth challenges
the capabilities of the human mind.
In order to celebrate mathematics in the new millennium, the CMI has
named seven “Millennium prize problems”. The Scientiﬁc Advisory Board
of the CMI selected these problems, focusing on important classic questions
that have resisted solution over the years. The Board of Directors of CMI
designated a $ 7 million prize fund to these problems, with $ 1 million
allocated to each.
The seven Millennium prize problems read as follows:
(i) The Riemann conjecture in number theory on the zeros of the Riemann zeta
function and the asymptotics of prime numbers.
(ii) The Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture in number theory on the relation
between the size of the solution set of a Diophantine equation and the behavior
of an associated zeta function near the critical point s = 1.
(iii) The Poincar´e conjecture in topology on the exceptional topological structure
of the 3-dimensional sphere.
(iv) The Hodge conjecture in algebraic geometry on the nice structure of projective
algebraic varieties.
(v) The Cook problem in computer sciences of deciding whether an answer that
can be quickly checked with inside knowledge, may without such help require
much longer to solve, no matter how clever a program we write.
(vi) The solution of the turbulence problem for viscous ﬂuids modelled by the
Navier–Stokes partial diﬀerential equations.
(vii) The rigorous mathematical foundation of a uniﬁed quantum ﬁeld theory for
elementary particles.

vlin, The Millennium Problems: the Seven Greatest Unsolved Mathematical

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for
Elementary Particles
First Law of Progress in Theoretical Physics: You will get nowhere by
crunching equations.
Second Law: Do not trust arguments based on the lowest order of pertur-
bation theory.
Third Law: You may use any degrees of freedom you like to describe a
physical system, but if you use the wrong ones, you’ll be sorry.1
Steven Weinberg, 1983
For the motivation and convenience of the reader, let us sketch important
basic ideas of elementary particle physics in this chapter. It is our philosophy
that before studying a complex subject, one should know the main goals in
nontechnical terms. As an introduction to particle physics, we recommend the
textbooks by Nachtmann (1990), Coughlan and Dood (1991), Sibold (2001),
and Seiden (2005). For the history of elementary particle physics, see the
beautiful books by the two Nobel laureates Steven Weinberg (1983), (1995)
and Martinus Veltman (2003).
In the 1960s and early 1970s, Gell-Mann and Fritzsch, Glashow, Salam,
and Weinberg founded the so-called Standard Model of particle physics which
is of fundamental importance for modern physics.2 The Standard Model of
particle physics is based on
• the principle of critical action, and
• the principle of local symmetry (gauge theory).
The Lagrangian density of the Standard Model will be thoroughly studied
in Volume III. It turns out that the Standard Model of particle physics is
governed by the same mathematical approach as Einstein’s theory of general
relativity on gravitation from 1915. The common mathematical tool is the
theory of curvature in modern diﬀerential geometry (called gauge theory in
physics). A survey on the Standard Model in particle physics and its possible
generalizations along with a summary of the most important literature can
be found in

quarks and leptons, the Higgs mass, CP violation, strong CP problem and
massless axions, dynamics of heavy quarks, precision electroweak measure-
ments, neutrino oscillations and neutrino masses, grand uniﬁcation of inter-
actions and extended gauge groups, proton decay, baryon asymmetry of the
universe, supersymmetry, the riddle of dark matter and dark energy in the
present universe, and string theory. Up-dated particle data are summarized
by
Particle Data Group. Internet: http://pdg.lbl.gov
For the cosmic microwave background radiation and its information on the
early universe see
NASA home page, WMAP, Internet: http://www.nasa.gov/home/
The WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) satellite experiment
of NASA allows us to see the state of the universe at the age of 400 000
years after the Big Bang. In particular, the WMAP experiment shows that
our universe is 13.7 · 109 years old. The ﬁve ages of our expanding universe
starting from the Big Bang are studied in Adams and Laughlin (1997), (1999)
(inside the physics of eternity). The ﬁve ages of our universe read as follows:
• the primordial era (from the Big Bang until the age of 105 years),
• the stelliferous era of the present universe (106–1014 years),
• the degenerate era (1015–1039 years) (brown and white dwarfs, neutron stars and
black holes dominate the universe),
• the black hole era (1040–10100 years) (black holes dominate the universe), and
• the dark era (> 10101 years).
It turns out that the expansion of our universe is accelerated. In the ﬁnal dark
era, the energy density of the universe goes to zero after the vaporization of
the last black holes by Hawking radiation. However, it is possible that a new
Big Bang is generated by large quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state
(vacuum) of the universe. For modern astrophysics and cosmology, we refer
to Schutz (2003) (phenomenology), Shore (2003) (tapestry of astrophysics),
B¨orner (2003) (early universe), and Straumann (2004) (general relativity and
astrophysics).
2.1 The System of Units
In this monograph, if not stated explicitly the contrary, we will use the inter-
national system of physical units, SI. This system is based on meter (length),
second (time), kilogram (mass), Kelvin (temperature), and Coulomb (electric
charge). Systems of units in physics are thoroughly discussed in the Appendix

(e.g., the SI system, the dimensionless Planck system, and the energetic sys-
tem of units in particle physics based on powers of energy). In the Appendix,
the interested reader also ﬁnds the very useful method of dimensional analysis
along with tables about the values of the universal constants and the mag-
nitudes of important physical quantities in nature. The knowledge of this is
important for a deeper understanding of physical phenomena appearing in
the real world.
2.2 Waves in Physics
Waves play a crucial role in physics, since they allow us to describe the
transport of energy and information in nature.
2.2.1 Harmonic Waves
To begin with, let us explain the terminology used by physicists for describing
waves. We are given the positive numbers ν, λ, a and the real number α. The
real function
y = a sin 2π
x
λ −νt + α
2π

(2.1)
is called a sinusoidal or harmonic wave. Let us discuss this. For ﬁxed time
t, the function y = y(x) from (2.1) has the period λ with respect to the
position variable x (Fig. 2.1). For ﬁxed x, the function y = y(t) has the time
period T = 1/ν. In order to avoid the factor 2π, physicists introduce both
the angular frequency ω := 2πν and the wave number κ := 2π/λ. Then
y = a sin(κx −ωt + α).
(2.2)
If position x and time t are related by
κx −ωt = const,
then y = a sin(κx −ωt + α) remains constant during all times. This means
that the wave propagates with the speed v = ω/κ = νλ from left to right.
Physicists use the following terminology:

ν = 1/T
frequency (number of oscillations per second),
κ = 2π/λ
wave number,
ω = 2πν
angular frequency,
v = ω/κ = νλ
phase velocity of the wave.
The function3
y = a sin(kx −ωt + α)
(2.3)
describes a so-called sinusoidal plane wave with the wave vector k and the
wave number κ := |k|. Let n be a unit vector. If we set x = xn and k = κn,
we obtain the function (2.2). Thus, the expression (2.3) corresponds to a wave
propagating with speed v in direction of the vector k and angular frequency
ω = v|k|.
Using the famous Euler exponential formula
eiz = cos z + i sin z
for all
z ∈C,
(2.4)
and letting A := aeiα, the wave (2.3) can be written as
y = ℑ(Aei(kx−ωt)).
2.2.2 Wave Packets
Group velocity. Typically, there exists a so-called dispersion relation
ω = ω(κ)
between the wave number κ and the angular frequency ω of a wave. In con-
trast to the phase velocity, v := ω(κ0)/κ0, the number
vg := ω′(κ0)
is called the group velocity corresponding to the wave number κ0. We want
to show that the group velocity can be regarded as the propagation speed
of small wave packets (Fig. 2.2). In terms of physics, the group velocity is
3 The symbol kx denotes the inner product between the vectors k and x. Moreover,
we set x2 := xx.

2.2 Waves in Physics

decisive, since energy propagates with group velocity. By deﬁnition, a wave
packet is obtained by the superposition of harmonic waves,
y(x, t) :=
 ∞
−∞
a(κ)ei(κx−ω(κ)t)dκ,
x, t ∈R.
We assume that the amplitude function a = a(κ) is mainly concentrated on
a small interval centered at the wave number κ0. In order to understand the
typical behavior of a wave packet, let us choose the amplitude function
a(κ) := Ce−1
2(
κ−κ0
∆κ )
2
where the number ∆κ > 0 is ﬁxed, and C denotes a positive constant. Fur-
thermore, we assume that the function ω = ω(κ) is a quadratic polynomial,
ω(κ) = ω0 + vg(κ −κ0) + b
2(κ −κ0)2.
Then
ω(κ)t −κx = (ω0t −κ0x) + (κ −κ0)(vgt −x) + b
2(κ −κ0)2t.
An explicit computation yields
y(x, t) = A(x −vgt) · ei(ω0t−κ0x),
x, t ∈R.
(2.5)
Explicitly, we have
A(x) :=
C

2π∆(t)
· e−1
2(
x
∆(t))
2
where
∆(t) :=

(∆κ)2 −ibt.
Here, we take the principal part of the square root.4 The wave packet
y = y(x, t) from (2.5) can be regarded as a modiﬁed harmonic wave which
propagates with the phase velocity ω0/κ0, and the amplitude A propagates
with the group velocity vg.
4 Let z = |z| eiϕ where −π < ϕ ≤π. Then, the principal part of the square root is
given by √z :=
p
|z| · eiϕ/2.

• If b = 0, then ∆(t) = ∆κ for all times t. In this case, the amplitude is
mainly concentrated on the interval [κ0 −∆κ, κ0 + ∆κ].
• If b ̸= 0, then
|∆(t)|4 = (∆κ)4 + b2t2
for all
t ∈R.
Hence |∆(t)| →+∞as t →+∞. This means that the wave packet is
diﬀusing as times goes to inﬁnity.
2.2.3 Standing Waves
The following investigations on the number of standing waves in a box were
critically used by Planck in 1900 in order to derive his famous radiation law
from Boltzmann statistics (see Sect. 2.3.2). Our goal is formula (2.6) below.
Consider ﬁrst the function
y = a sin κx
where κ := nπ/L, n = 1, 2, . . . Since y(0) = y(L) = 0, this is called a
standing wave on the interval [0, L] (Fig. 2.3). Let N(R) denote the number
of standing waves on [0, L] with the restriction κ ≤R. Approximately,
N(R) =
R
π/L = RL
π .
Let us now pass to the 3-dimensional case. By deﬁnition, the function
y = A sin κ1x · sin κ2y · sin κ3z
with κj = njπ/L and nj = 1, 2, ..., j = 1, 2, 3 represents a 3-dimensional
standing wave in the box B := {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : 0 ≤x, y, z ≤L} of volume
V = L3. Set k := (κ1, κ2, κ3). Let N(R) denote the number of standing
waves in the box B with |k| ≤R, and let V denote the volume of the pos-
itive quadrant {k : |k| ≤R, κ1, κ2, κ3 ≥0} of a ball of radius R (Fig. 2.4).
Approximately,
N(R) =
V
(π/L)3 .

∆N = V ω2
2π2c3 ∆ω
(2.6)
is the number of standing waves in the box B of volume V corresponding to
the interval [ω, ω + ∆ω] of angular frequency.
2.2.4 Electromagnetic Waves
The Maxwell equations for the electric ﬁeld vector E = E(x, t) and the
magnetic ﬁeld vector B = B(x, t) in vacuum read as
div E = 0,
div B = 0,
curl E = −˙B,
c2 curl B = ˙E,
(2.7)
where c is the velocity of light in a vacuum. The dot denotes the partial time
derivative. Let i, j, n be a right-handed orthonormal vector basis. An explicit
computation shows that the harmonic waves
E = a cos(kx −ωt) · i + b sin(kx −ωt + α) · j,
B = n × E
c
along with k := κn and the dispersion relation ω = cκ represent a solution of
the Maxwell equations. This electromagnetic wave (light wave) propagates in
direction of the unit vector n. From cg = ω′(κ) = c we obtain that the group
velocity of light is equal to the phase velocity. Thus, the light is polarized.
This means that the amplitude of the harmonic wave E = E(x, t) is a vector.
Explicitly, we have the following possibilities:
• If a2 + b2 ̸= 0, the polarization is called elliptic.

86
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
• If a = b and a ̸= 0, the polarization is called circular.
• If a ̸= 0, b = 0 or a = 0, b ̸= 0, the polarization is called linear.

magnetic) ﬁeld constant of a vacuum. Moreover, c2 = 1/ε0µ0. In addition,
the energy current density vector is equal to S = E × H. For our light wave,
we get the energy density η = a2 +b2, and hence E = ηV as well as S = cηn.
This yields the crucial relation E2 = c2p2. Hence
E = c|p|
which corresponds to the Einstein relation E2 = m2
0c4 + c2p2 with vanishing
rest mass, m0 = 0.
2.2.5 Superposition of Waves and the Fourier Transform
The profound study of nature is the most fertile source of mathematics.
Joseph Fourier (1768–1830)
The Fourier transform represents a fundamental duality between time and
frequency (resp. time and energy).
The frequency space. Let a : R →C be a measurable (e.g., continuous)
function with

R |a(ω)|dω < ∞. Then, the integral
f(t) =
1
√
2π

R
a(ω) e−iωtdω
exists for all times t ∈R. The function f represents the superposition of har-
monic waves. The amplitude function a = a(ω) is called the Fourier transform
of the time-dependent function f with respect to angular frequency ω. Prop-
erties of the Fourier transform will be considered in Sect. 10.3.3 on page 535
by using the space S(R) of smooth complex-valued functions on the real line
which are rapidly decreasing at inﬁnity. For example, if f ∈S(R), then we
get a ∈S(R) along with the inverse transformation formula
a(ω) =
1
√
2π

R
f(t) eiωtdt
for all
ω ∈R.
In particular, if we choose the Gaussian function f(t) := e−t2
2 for all t ∈R,
then

a(ω) = f(ω)
for all
ω ∈R.
This means that the Gaussian function is distinguished by the fact that it is
invariant under the Fourier transform. This transform was extensively used
by Fourier in his treatise Th´eorie analytique de la chaleur (analytic heat
theory) from 1822.
The Fourier transform plays a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld
theory.
In particular, Feynman’s elegant approach to quantum physics via path in-
tegrals is closely related to Fourier’s heat kernel method for solving the heat
equation (see page 588). Furthermore,
• the Dirac calculus, and
• von Neumann’s spectral theory for self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space
represent far-reaching generalizations of the Fourier method to quantum ﬁeld
theory.
The energy space. Let us use the transformation
E = ℏω
in order to pass from the frequency space to the energy space. From the
physical point of view, E is the energy of a photon which has the frequency
ν = ω/2π. Setting b(E) := a(E/ℏ)/
√
ℏ, we get
f(t) =
 ∞

e−iEt/ℏ

along with the inverse transformation formula
b(E) =

eiEt/ℏ
√
2πℏ
f(t)dt
for all
E ∈R.
(2.9)
In terms of quantum physics, the time-dependent function t →f(t) is repre-
sented as a superposition of the functions
t →e−iEt/ℏ
√
2πℏ
which correspond to quantum states of energy E.
For historical reasons, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists use
diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the Fourier transform.
This will be discussed on page 538. Our deﬁnition (2.9) ﬁts the needs of quan-
tum physics. In particular, the normalization factor

√
2πℏguarantees that the
map f →b is a unitary operator on the Hilbert space L2(R). Furthermore, in

terms of the elegant Dirac calculus, formulas (2.8) and (2.9) can be written
symmetrically as
⟨t|f⟩=

⟨t|E⟩⟨E|f⟩dE
and
⟨E|f⟩=

R
⟨E|t⟩⟨t|f⟩dt,
respectively, where we set ⟨t|f⟩:= f(t) and ⟨E|f⟩:= b(E), as well as
⟨t|E⟩= ⟨E|t⟩† := e−iEt/ℏ

R
ei(E−E0)t/ℏdt = δ(E −E0)
for all E, E0 ∈R. Here, the symbol δ denotes the Dirac delta function. This
will be discussed in Sect. 12.1ﬀ.
The local inversion theorem. As a preparation for the Laplace trans-
form below, let us recall the classical main theorem on the inversion of the
Fourier transform. The key formulas are given by (2.9) and the following
modiﬁcation of the superposition formula (2.8):

We assume that this ﬁnite limit exists which is called Cauchy’s ‘principal
value’ of the integral.
Theorem 2.1 Suppose that the function f : R →C is continuous except
for a ﬁnite number of points and
 ∞
−∞|f(t)|dt < ∞. Then, the integral (2.9)
exists.
If, in addition, the function f is diﬀerentiable in an open neighborhood of
the point t0, then the inverse formula (2.10) holds true.
The classical proof can be found in Doetsch (1956), Vol. 1, Sect. 4.2.

2.2.6 Damped Waves, the Laplace Transform, and Dispersion
Relations
In his 1812 treatise Th´eorie analytique des probabilit´es, Pierre-Simon
Laplace (1749–1824) extensively used special integrals of the type
F(s) :=
Z ∞
0
f(t)e−stdt
in order to solve both diﬀerential equations and diﬀerence equations and
to obtain asymptotic expansions. In modern terminology, these integrals
correspond to the Laplace transform. Historically, in 1737 Euler was the
ﬁrst who applied such integrals for solving diﬀerential equations. However,
it seems that Laplace did not know Euler’s results.
Gustav Doetsch

Damped wave. In particle accelerators, physicists observe unstable particles
of ﬁnite lifetime. Such particles are also called resonances. Let us model this
by using the so-called damped wave
y(t) = Ae−γ0t · e−iω0t = Ae−i(ω0−iγ0)t,
t ∈R
(2.11)
where the real number ω0 and the positive number γ0 are called the angu-
lar frequency and the damping constant, respectively. The nonzero complex
number A is called the amplitude. Obviously,
lim
t→+∞y(t) = 0,
that is, the wave vanishes at large time. The number
tmean := 1
γ 0
is called the mean lifetime of the damped wave. Observe that during the time
interval [0, tmean] the damping function t →e−γ0t decreases from e0 = 1 to
e−1 ∼1
2. Explicitly, if A = aeiα with a > 0 and α ∈R, then
y(t) = ae−γ0t · (cos(ω0 −α) −i sin(ω0 −α)),
t ∈R.
Summarizing, we obtain that
Damped waves can be described by complex frequencies ω0−iγ0. Here,
the imaginary part is related to the mean lifetime of the wave by
tmean = 1/γ0.
Truncated damped wave. By deﬁnition, the Heaviside function θ
switches on physical processes at time t = 0. Explicitly, we set θ(t) := 1
if t ≥0 and θ(t) := 0 if t < 0. The function

90
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
y(t) = Aθ(t)e−γ0t · e−iω0t,
t ∈R
(2.12)
describes a damped wave which is switched on at time t = 0. Roughly speak-
ing, the notion of truncated damped wave is related to causality. We will show
below that this corresponds to analyticity properties of the Fourier transform.
Generally, there exists a deep relation between causality and analyt-
icity in physics.
The dispersion relation. The Fourier transform of the damped wave
(2.11) reads as5
a(ω) =
 ∞
−∞

Ae−γ0t e−iω0t
eiωt dt.
This integral does not exist in the classical sense because of e−γ0t →+∞as
t →−∞. The situation changes completely if we replace the damped wave
by a truncated damped wave. Then
a(ω) =
 ∞
−∞
(Aθ(t)e−γ0te−iω0t eiωt) dt =
 ∞
0
Ae−γ0t+i(ω−ω0)tdt.
Explicitly, for all ω ∈R,
a(ω) =
lim
T →+∞A · e−γ0T ei(ω−ω0)T −1
i(ω −ω0) −γ0
=
iA
ω −(ω0 −iγ0).
Analytic continuation yields the meromorphic function
a(ω) =
iA
ω −(ω0 −iγ0),
ω ∈C \ {ω0 −iγ0}
on the complex ω-plane which has precisely one singularity at the point
ω0 −iγ0 in the open lower half-plane. This singularity encodes both the an-
gular frequency of the damped wave, ω0, and the lifetime, tmean = 1/γ0. By
Theorem 2.1 on page 88, the inverse Fourier transform yields
Aθ(t)e−γ0te−iω0t = 1
2π PV
 ∞
−∞
a(ω)e−iωt dω,
t ∈R \ {0}.
In particular, the Laplace transform ω →a(ω) is holomorphic in the closed
upper half-plane. Moreover, the real and imaginary part of a(ω) satisfy the
relations
ℑ(a(ω)) = 1

with respect to the singularity of the integrand at the point ω ∈R. This has
the following important consequence. If we know, say, the real part ℜ(a(ω))
on the real line, then we get the imaginary part ℑ(a(ω)) on the real line, by
(2.13). Furthermore, the classical Cauchy residue formula
a(ω) =

2πi
lim
R→+∞
 R
−R

ξ −ω ,
ℑ(ω) > 0
yields the values of a(ω) on the open upper-half plane.6 Using analytic con-
tinuation, we then get the function a = a(ω) on the complex plane.
Summarizing, for a truncated damped wave, the imaginary part of
the Laplace transform a = a(ω) on the real line knows all about the
meromorphic function a on the complex plane.
In mathematics, the map ℑ(a) = Hℜ(a) given by (2.13) is called the Hilbert
transform (see Sect. 11.9.3 on page 663). In physics, the relations (2.13)
and (2.14) are called dispersion relations (see Sect. 12.4.5 on causality and
analyticity).
The basic trick of the Laplace transformation. Let us now consider
the critical case where γ0 ≤0. The trick is to introduce a damping factor
e−γt. In fact, in order to get a convergent integral, we change the Laplace
transform by setting
a(ω + iγ) :=
 ∞
0

Ae−(γ0+γ)t e−iω0
eiωt dt.
To get a damping factor, we choose the real number γ in such a way that
γ0 + γ > 0. This can be written as
a(ω + iγ) =
 ∞
0

Ae−γ0te−iω0t
ei(ω+iγ)t dt.
Explicitly,
a(ω + iγ) =
iA
ω + iγ −(ω0 −iγ0)
for all real numbers ω, γ with γ > −γ0. By the inverse Fourier transform,
6 This follows as in Problem 12.1 on page 732.

The energy space. Setting E = ℏω, let us pass over to the space of
complex energy E = E −iΓ. The damped wave (2.12) can be equivalently
written as
y(t) = Ae−iE0t/ℏ
t ∈R
where E0 = E0 −iΓ with E0 := ℏω0 and Γ0 := ℏγ0. The Laplace transform
(2.16) reads as
(Ly)(E) =
iℏA
E −E0
(2.15)
for all E ∈C with ℑ(E) > ℑ(E0).
The Laplace transform in the energetic space. The two key formulas
read as
(Lf)(E) :=
 ∞

eiEt/ℏf(t) dt
for all
E ∈Hγ0
(2.16)
and
f(t) =
1
2πℏPV

L
e−iEt/ℏ(Lf)(E) dE
for all
t > 0.
(2.17)
The function L is called the Laplace transform of the function f in the energy
space. Furthermore, for given real number γ0 we write f ∈Kγ0 iﬀ7 the
continuous function f : [0, ∞[→C satisﬁes the growth condition
|f(t)| ≤const · e−γ0t
for all
t ≥0.
Moreover, we introduce the open half-plane Hγ0 := {E ∈C : ℑ(E) > −ℏγ0}.
Theorem 2.2 Let f ∈Kγ0. Then, the Laplace transform Lf given by (2.16)
is a holomorphic function on the open half-plane Hγ0.
The inverse transform f = L−1F is given by (2.17). Here, we integrate
over a ﬁxed, but otherwise arbitrary line L in Hγ0 which is parallel to the real
axis.
7 In mathematics, ‘iﬀ’ stands for ‘if and only if’.

2.2 Waves in Physics
93
Using the same argument as for damped waves above, the inversion for-
mula (2.17) follows easily from the inversion formula for the Fourier transform
(2.10).8 It is crucial for physics that the Laplace transform Lf is holomorphic
in an open half-plane of the complex energy space. As we will show later on,
after carrying out an analytic continuation, the singularities of the Laplace
transform L are of great physical importance. They correspond to both the
energies of bound states and their lifetimes.
The Laplace transform in the frequency space. This is obtained
from (2.16) by using the replacement E ⇒ω and setting ℏ:= 1. In terms of
physics, this corresponds to using the energetic system of units.
Three basic rules. The following rules allow us to solve diﬀerential equa-
tions and to get information about the solutions in terms of superpositions
of harmonic waves or damped waves. Moreover, the resonance eﬀects become
transparent. To simplify notation, let us set ℏ:= 1 in (i)-(iii) below (i.e., we
work in the energetic system).
(i) Wave rule. Let k = 0, 1, . . . . For complex energy E0 = E0 −iΓ0, the
Laplace transform of the function
f(t) := tke−iE0t,
t ≥0
is equal to
(Lf)(E) =
ik+1k!
(E −E0)k+1
for all complex energies E with ℑ(E) > ℑ(E0).
(ii) Derivative rule. We are given the function f ∈Kγ0. Moreover, we assume
that the time derivatives ˙f, ¨f also lie in Kγ0. Then

L ˙f

(E) = −iE · L(f)(E) −f(+0)
and

L ¨f

(E) = (−iE)2L(f)(E) + iE · f(+0) −˙f(+0)
for all E ∈C with ℑ(E) > −γ0. This way, the Laplace transform converts
diﬀerentiation into multiplication.9
(iii) Convolution rule. Let f, g ∈Kγ0. Set

f ∗g

(t) :=
 t
0
f(t −τ)g(τ) dτ
for all
t ≥0.
The function f ∗g is called the causal convolution between the functions
f and g. Then
8 See the standard textbooks by Widder (1944) and Doetsch (1956). As an intro-
duction to the Laplace transform, we recommend Zeidler (2004).
9 As usual, the symbol g(+0) stands for the limit limt→+0 g(t).

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
L(f ∗g) = Lf · Lg
on
Hγ0.
This tells us that the product in the energy space corresponds to the
causal convolution in the original time space.
Proof. Ad (i). If k = 0, the claim follows from (2.15). For k = 1, 2, . . .,
diﬀerentiate successively equation (2.16) with respect to the parameter E0.

Finally, apply the limit T →+∞. Observe that
|eiET f(T )| ≤const · e−(ℑ(E)+γ0)T →0
as
T →+∞
if ℑ(E) > −γ0. The same argument applied to ˙f yields
L( ¨f) = −iE · L( ˙f) −˙f(+0).
Ad (iii). Set h := f ∗g. It follows from
 t

2.2.7 The Response Function, the Feynman Propagator, and
Causality
We want to use the Laplace transform in order to construct the prototype of
the Feynman propagator. The idea is to describe mathematically the response
of a physical system to an external force which is switched on at the initial
time t = 0.
The causal initial-value problem for the harmonic oscillator. As
a simple example, let us consider the following initial-value problem
m¨x(t) = −κ0x(t) + F(t),
t > 0,
x(+0) = x0,
˙x(+0) = v0
(2.18)
along with x(t) = 0 for all t < 0. Here, the function x = x(t) describes
the motion of a classical particle of mass m > 0 on the real line under the
inﬂuence of

2.2 Waves in Physics
95
• the repulsive force −κ0x with the coupling constant κ0 > 0, and
• the external force F which is switched on at the initial time t = 0, that is,
F(t) = 0 for all t < 0. We assume that the given function F : R →R is
continuous on the time interval [0, ∞[.
We are given the initial position x0 and the initial velocity v0 of the particle
at time t = 0. We are looking for a solution x : R →R which is diﬀerentiable
twice on the open time interval ]0, ∞[. In addition, we postulate that the
functions x and ˙x can be continuously extended to the closed time interval
[0, ∞[. We set ω0 :=

κ0/m.
Theorem 2.3 The initial-value problem (2.18) has the unique solution
x(t) = θ(t)
	
x0 cos ω0t + v0
ω0
· sin ω0t +
1
mω0
 t
0
sin ω0(t −τ) · F(τ) dτ

for all times t ∈R.
Proof. To simplify notation, set m := 1.
(I) Existence. Let t > 0. Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields
˙x(t) = −ω0x0 sin ω0t + v0 cos ω0t +
 t
0
cos ω0(t −τ) · F(τ) dτ.
Note that the diﬀerentiation of the integral yields the additional term
sin ω0(t −t) · F(t) which vanishes. Furthermore,
¨x(t) = −ω2
0x0 cos ω0t −ω0v0 sin ω0t −ω0
 t
0
sin ω0(t −τ) · F(τ)dτ + F(t).
Hence ¨x(t) = −ω2
0x(t) + F(t) if t > 0.
(II) Uniqueness. Suppose that the two functions x1, x2 : R →R are
solutions of (2.18). Deﬁne x(t) := x1(t) −x2(t). The function x : R →R
satisﬁes then problem (2.18) in the special case where x0 = v0 = 0 and
F(t) ≡0. By a standard result, this implies x(t) ≡0.
2
The retarded Green’s function. Set
G(t) :=

sin ω0t
mω0
if
t ≥0,
0
if
t < 0.
If x0 = v0 = 0, that is, the particle rests at time t = 0, then the solution
from Theorem 2.3 can be written as
x(t) =
 ∞
−∞
G(t −τ)F(τ) dτ
for all
t ∈R.
(2.19)
Synonymously, the function G is called

96
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
• the response function,
• the Feynman propagator, and
• the retarded Green’s function
of the causal initial-value problem (2.18) for the harmonic oscillator on the
real line. In terms of physics, the function G describes the response of the
harmonic oscillator to the action of the external force F which is switched
on at time t = 0. Here, the harmonic oscillator rests on the time interval
] −∞, 0]. Observe that the construction of the function G critically depends
on causality, that is, this function refers to the behavior of the harmonic
oscillator in the future.
Response functions play a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory.
We will study this in Chap. 14.
The Dirac delta function. Physicists like to use the Dirac delta func-
tion δ = δ(t) in order to introduce the Green’s function G in a formal, but
elegant way. To this end, they choose the external force
F(t) := δ(t)
for all
t ∈R
which only acts at the initial time t = 0. Using the characteristic property
(11.19) of the Dirac delta function on page 590, it follows from (2.19) that
x(t) =
 ∞
−∞
G(t −τ)δ(τ)dτ = G(t)
for all
t ∈R.
Intuitively, the retarded Green’s function t →G(t) describes the motion of a
harmonic oscillator on the real line
• which rests on the time interval ] −∞, 0], and
• which starts to move under the inﬂuence of a large external force that acts
precisely at the time point t = 0.
Observe that the Dirac delta function is not a classical function, but a gener-
alized function also called distribution. The rigorous theory of distributions
will be studied in Chap. 11.
Application of the Laplace transform to the harmonic oscillator.
We want to show how the solution from Theorem 2.3 can be obtained by using
the Laplace transform. To display the elegant basic idea as clearly as possible,
we restrict ourselves to a formal argument by ignoring the range of validity of
the following formulas. Moreover, in order to simplify notation we set m := 1
and ℏ:= 1. Then E = ω. We will use the basic rules (i), (ii), (iii) for the
Laplace transform considered on page 93.
To begin with, suppose that the function x = x(t) is a solution of the
causal initial-value problem (2.18) above. By the derivative rule (ii), the
Laplace transform Lx satisﬁes the equation

Hence

This means that the Laplace transform Lx of the motion possesses a very
simple structure in the frequency space. This solution depends critically on
the function
R(ω) :=
1
ω2
0 −ω2
which is called the response function of the harmonic oscillator in the fre-
quency space. The singularities of the function R at the points ω = ±ω0
correspond to the eigenoscillations t →e±iω0t of the harmonic oscillator. We
will see at the end of the proof that the function R is the Laplace transform
of the retarded Green’s function G. It remains to reconstruct the function
x = x(t) from its Laplace transform. Let us discuss this.
Using partial fractions and the wave rule (i), we get

The explicit statement that matter is composed of indivisible particles
called atoms (from the Greek ατoµoσ, atomos, “uncuttable”) we trace
to the ancient town of Abdera, on the seacoast of Thrace. There, in the
latter part of the ﬁfth century B.C., the Greek philosophers Leucippus

and Democritus10 taught that all matter is made up of atoms and empty
space. . . After the birth of modern science, the idea of atoms came to
be used as a basis of quantitative theories of matter. In the 17th century
Newton attempted to account for the expansion of gases in terms of the
outrush of their atoms into empty space. More inﬂuential, in the early
19th century Dalton explained the ﬁxed ratios of the weights of chemical
elements that make up common compounds in terms of the relative weights
of the atoms of these elements. . .
By the end of the 19th century the idea of the atom had become familiar
to most scientists – familiar but not yet universally accepted. . . All this
changed in the ﬁrst decades of the 20th century. . .
Just as ancient Abdera symbolizes for us the birth of atomism, there is
one place with which the discovery of constituents of the atom is espe-
cially associated: It is the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cam-
bridge (England) founded in 1874.11 There, in 1895, Thomson performed
the experiments on cathode rays that led him to conclude that there is a
particle – the electron – that is both the carrier of electricity and a ba-
sic constituent of all atoms. It was at the Cavendish in 1895–1898 that
Rutherford began his work on radioactivity, and to the Cavendish in 1919
that Rutherford returned, after his discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911,
to succeed Thomson as Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics and
to found what was long the preeminent center for nuclear physics. The
list of constituents of the atom was completed at the Cavendish Labo-
ratory in 1932, when Chadwick discovered the neutron . . . All ordinary
matter is composed of atoms which in turn consist of protons, neutrons,
and electrons. . .
The particle menu changed drastically in the 1950s when large accelerators
like the Betatron at Berkeley and new devices for detecting particles like
the bubble chamber began to become available. In the debris of collisions
of the high-energy protons from these accelerators were found a great va-
riety of new hadrons, labelled ρ, ω, η, φ, ∆, Ξ, Ω, and so on – so many that
the Greek alphabet was in danger of exhaustion. They were all unstable
with extremely short lifetimes, which is why they are absent in ordinary
matter. . . Soon an attempt was made to restore some economy to the
multitude of hadrons. In the early 1960s Murray Gell-Mann and George
Zweig of the California Institute of Technology, building on earlier work of
Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne’eman of Tel-Aviv, proposed independently that
the hadrons are all composites of a few types of really elementary building
blocks, called quarks by Gell-Mann.12

Quantum ﬁeld theory is a set of ideas and tools that combine three of the
major themes of modern physics: the quantum theory, the ﬁeld concept,
and the principle of relativity. Today, most working physicists need to know
some quantum ﬁeld theory, and many others are curious about it. The
theory underlies modern elementary particle physics, and supplies essential
tools to nuclear physics, atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and
astrophysics. In addition, quantum ﬁeld theory has led to new bridges
between physics and mathematics.
One might think that a subject of such power and widespread application
would be complex and diﬃcult. In fact, the central concepts and tech-
niques of quantum ﬁeld theory are quite simple and intuitive. This is espe-
cially true of the many pictorial tools (Feynman diagrams, renormalization
group ﬂows, and spaces of symmetry transformations) that are routinely
used by quantum ﬁeld theorists. Admittedly, these tools take time to learn,
and tying the subject together with rigorous proofs can become extremely
technical. Nevertheless, we feel that the basic concepts and tools of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory can be made accessible to all physicists, not just an elite
group of experts.

The gauge theories for the strong and electroweak interaction have become
the Standard Model of particle physics. They realize in a consistent way
the requirements of quantum theory, special relativity and symmetry prin-
ciples. For the ﬁrst time, we have a consistent theory of the fundamental
interactions that allows for precision calculations for many experiments.
The Standard Model has, up to now, successfully passed all experimental
tests. This success establishes the importance of gauge theories, despite
the fact that gravity is not included and that the Standard Model is most
likely an eﬀective theory resulting from the low-energy limit of a more
fundamental theory.

If supersymmetry plays the role in physics that we suspect it does, then it is
very likely to be discovered by the next generation of particle accelerators,
either at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, or at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
Edward Witten, 200016
If we are looking around, we see matter and light in the physical world. There
arises the question about the deeper structure of matter and light and the
ﬁnal causes for these structures. The causes are called forces (or interactions)
by physicists.
Classical gravitation. In the 17th century, Newton introduced the no-
tion of gravitational force. This way, Newton could justify Kepler’s empirical
laws on the motion of planets. The precision of Newton’s mechanics was so
high that, by using the methods of perturbation theory, astronomers could
successfully predict the existence of new planets, namely, Neptune and Pluto
in 1846 and 1930, respectively.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the 19th century, Faraday studied ex-
perimentally the electromagnetic force. In particular, he discovered the law of
induction on the relation between electricity and magnetism in 1821. Maxwell
formulated mathematically his celebrated theory of electromagnetism in 1864.
The point is that the Maxwell equations unify two apparently diﬀerent forces
in nature, namely, the electric and the magnetic force. To this end, Maxwell
used Faraday’s fundamental idea of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The existence
of electromagnetic waves was demonstrated experimentally by Hertz in 1886.
In the 20th century, classical physics was revolutionized by
• quantum physics based on Planck’s quantum hypothesis from the year
1900,
• Einstein’s 1905 theory of special relativity (e.g., electrodynamics of moving
bodies),
• Einstein’s 1905 theory of light quanta (photons), and
• Einstein’s 1915 theory of general relativity for gravitation.
Let us discuss some crucial points.

2.3.1 Planck’s Radiation Law
My new universal radiation formula was submitted to the Berlin Physi-
cal Society, at the meeting on October 19, 1900. On the very day when
I formulated this law by using purely formal arguments, I began to de-
vote myself to the task of investing it with a true physical meaning. This
quest let me to study the interrelation between entropy and probability.
Since the entropy S is an additive magnitude, but the probability W is a
multiplicative one, I simply postulated that
S = k ln W,
where k is a universal constant.17 I found that k represents the so-called
absolute gas constant. It is, understandably, often called Boltzmann’s con-
stant. However, this calls for the comment that Boltzmann (1844–1906)
never introduced this constant.
Now, as for the quantity W with respect to radiation in a cavity, I found
that in order to interpret it as a probability, it was necessary to introduce
a universal constant which I called h. Since it had the physical dimension
of action (energy times time), I gave it the name elementary quantum of
action. Thus the nature of entropy as a measure of probability, in the sense
indicated by Boltzmann, was established in the domain of radiation, too.
While the signiﬁcance of the quantum of action for the interrelation be-
tween entropy and probability was established, the part played by the
new constant in general physical processes still remained an open ques-
tion. I therefore tried immediately to weld the elementary quantum of
action into the framework of classical theory. But in the face of all such
attempts, which continued for a number of years, this constant showed
itself to be obdurate. For it heralded the advent of something entirely un-
precedented (namely, quantum physics), and was destined to remodel ba-
sically the physical outlook and thinking of man which, ever since Newton
(1643–1727) and Leibniz (1646–1716) laid the groundwork for inﬁnitesimal
calculus, were founded on the assumption that all causal interactions in
nature are continuous.18
Max Planck (1858–1947)
The birth of quantum physics in 1900. Consider a star with surface
temperature T . For example, the surface temperature of the sun is equal to
6000K. The famous Planck radiation law from 1900 describes the amount
EA of electromagnetic energy which is emitted from the surface area A of
the star during the time interval [0, t] with respect to the interval [ω1, ω2] of
angular frequency. Explicitly,
EA = ctA

cisely, the Planck radiation law refers to the radiation of a black body. By
deﬁnition, a body is called ‘black’ by physicists iﬀit absorbs all the incoming
electromagnetic radiation. In other words, there is no reﬂection of incoming
radiation. The radiation coming from stars can be described approximately
by black-body radiation. If we pass to the wave length λ, then we obtain

of the Planck radiation law.

and x := hc/(kTλ). The corresponding iteration scheme

Cavity radiation. Consider a box of volume V ﬁlled with electromag-

the interval [ω1, ω2] of angular frequency is given by
E = η(T )V

 ω2

The classical radiation argument. It was discovered by Kirchhoﬀ
(1824–1884) that there exists a close connection between the energy density
η(T ) of the electromagnetic radiation in a box and the energy EA radiated
by a black body. Explicitly,
EA = ctAη(T )
4
.
(2.26)
The basic idea is to equip the box with a small slot of surface area A. The ra-
diation coming from the slot then represents the black body radiation (2.26).
The complete argument can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, p. 410.

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
Consequently, in order to derive the Planck radiation law (2.20), it is suﬃ-
cient to justify (2.24), (2.25). This will be done in the following. We will use
two diﬀerent arguments based on phenomenological thermodynamics and the
Boltzmann statistics.
Planck’s ﬁrst justiﬁcation of the radiation law. Let us consider
the argument from phenomenological thermodynamics that was used ﬁrst by
Planck in 1899 to obtain the energy density (2.24). Later on Planck applied
Boltzmann’s method of statistical mechanics to the radiation law. In 1893
Wien published the radiation law
P(ω, T ) = Aω3e−Bω/T.
(2.27)
Tests showed, however, that this law failed for low frequencies. In 1899, Lord
Rayleigh formulated the law (2.23) for small frequencies. The idea of Planck
was to get the universal law for all frequencies by interpolating the Wien law
and the Rayleigh–Jeans law. To this end, he used the notion of entropy. To
explain this, let us start with a general thermodynamic system which has one
degree of freedom. Such a system is described by the fundamental equation
TdS = dE + pdV
(2.28)
between volume V , pressure p, temperature T , inner energy E, and entropy
S. Choose E and V as basic variables.19 Then
S = S(E, V ),
T = T (E, V ),
p = p(E, V ).
From (2.28) we get TSEdE + TSV dV = dE + pdV . Hence
SE = 1
T ,
SV = p
T .
Consider now the cavity radiation in a box of volume V with respect to
the interval [ω, ω + ∆ω] of angular frequency, where ∆ω is suﬃciently small.
Then
E = V P(ω, T )∆ω
with the unknown function P. To simplify notation, in what follows we will
denote diﬀerent constants by the same symbols C and D.
(i) The Rayleigh–Jeans law. From (2.23) we obtain
E = kTV ω2∆ω
π2c3
= CT.
Hence E′(T ) = C. Since SE = T −1, it follows from the chain rule that

with substantial applications can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, Chaps. 67

This implies

By (2.29),
SEE = −C

From (2.29) we get relation (2.30). This way, Planck obtained the desired
function
P =

eD/T −1
of the radiation law. This method, however, does not determine the constants
C and D. As we will show below, the stronger methods of the Boltzmann
statistics along with the quantum hypothesis allow us the determination of
the unknown constants.

2.3.2 The Boltzmann Statistics and Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
Entropy and Boltzmann’s partition function. Consider a system which
can attain the possible energy states E0, E1, . . . , Em. According to Boltzmann
statistics, the mean value E of energy and the energy ﬂuctuation ∆E at
temperature T are given by

The condition Lpn = 0 for all n yields

Hence pn = const · eλEn/k. Set λ = −1/T . Using 
n pn = 1, we get the
desired result (2.32). From a formal point of view, this argument shows that
temperature is nothing else than a Lagrange multiplier.

Relation (2.33) will be used now in order to obtain the Planck radiation law.
Planck’s quantum hypothesis. In 1900, Max Planck postulated that
the energy of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the walls of a cavity
is quantized. The energy quanta are given by the formula
∆E = ℏω.
(2.34)
Here, ω denotes the angular frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Recall
that ℏ:= h/2π where
h = 6.626 · 10−34Js
is a fundamental constant in nature called the Planck constant (or Planck’s
quantum of action). Note that actions have the physical dimension of “energy
times time”. This is the most important physical quantity in nature. In daily
life, the actions have themagnitude of 1 Js. Planck’s quantum hypothesis
marked a revolutionin physics. It paved the way to modern quantum physics.
Let us discuss how Planck obtained his radiation law from the quantum
hypothesis. Consider a cubic cavity of length L and volume V = L3 ﬁlled
with electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium. By (2.6) on
page 85, the number of standing electromagnetic waves with respect to the
interval [ω, ω + ∆ω] of angular frequencies is equal to
2∆N = V ω2∆ω
π2c3
.
The factor 2 can be motivated by the fact that plane electromagnetic waves
possess 2 linearly independent directions of polarization. Thus, the radiation
energy of the cavity with respect to [ω, ω + ∆ω] is
2∆N · E =
V ℏω3∆ω
π2c3(eℏω/kT −1)
by (2.33). According to (2.24) on page 103, this yields the Planck function
P(ω, T ) =
ℏω3
π2c3(eℏω/kT −1).
Heisenberg’s ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator.
Quantum mechanics was founded by Heisenberg in 1925. Born noticed that
Heisenberg’s ideas could be converted into a theory for inﬁnite-dimensional
matrices. Heisenberg showed that the quantized energy of a harmonic oscil-
lator of angular frequency ω is given by the key formula
E = ℏω
	
n + 1
2

,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(2.35)

2.3 Historical Background
109
This result justiﬁes Planck’s quantum hypothesis for the harmonic oscillator.
In particular, Heisenberg obtained the value E = 1
2ℏω for the energy of the
ground state corresponding to n = 0. The same argument as in (2.33) shows
that the mean energy of a large system of harmonic oscillators at temperature
T is given by
E =
ℏω
eℏω/kT −1 + ℏω
2 .
In 1926 Schr¨odinger formulated his wave quantum mechanics based on a par-
tial diﬀerential equation – the famous Schr¨odinger equation. We will show in
Volume II how the key formula (2.35) follows from the Schr¨odinger equation
for the harmonic oscillator.
2.3.3 Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity
In the year 1905, in the same volume of the journal Annalen der Physik,
Einstein published four seminal papers on
(i) special relativity (electrodynamics of moving bodies),
(ii) the relation E = m0c2 between the rest mass m0 of a particle and its
rest energy E,
(iii) the photoelectric eﬀect (light particle hypothesis), and
(iv) the Brownian motion.
Let us discuss a few basic ideas.
The fundamental role played by inertial systems. Each physical
theory has to be described by both
• fundamental equations of motion and
• the systems of reference in which the equations of motion are valid.
In addition, one has to know how to transform the equations of motion be-
tween diﬀerent systems of reference.
For example, the Newtonian equations of mechanics are valid in each
inertial system. By deﬁnition, a Cartesian coordinate system is an inertial
system iﬀthere exists a system time t for it such that each mass point, which is
far enough from other masses and shielded against ﬁelds (e.g., light pressure),
remains at rest or moves rectilinearly with constant velocity. For example, a
spaceship represents an inertial system if it is located at far distance from
stars and planets and it ﬂies without rocket propulsion. The experience of
astronomers shows that each Cartesian system Σsun is a good approximation
of an inertial system. Such a system is deﬁned as follows.
• The system has its origin at the center of gravity of our solar system, which
lies within the sun.
• The axes of Σsun point towards ﬁxed stars which can be chosen arbitrarily.

110
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
In addition, note that a Cartesian coordinate system represents an inertial
system if it is obtained from Σsun by a constant translatory motion. The
rotating earth is not an inertial system.
In 1905 Einstein derived his theory of special relativity from the postulate
that
Physical processes proceed the same way in all inertial systems.
This is called the principle of special relativity. We will show later on that this
principle implies that relativistic physics has to be described mathematically
in terms of invariants of the Poincar´e group. Around 1900 it was a famous
open problem in physics to determine the systems of reference in which the
Maxwell equations are valid and to understand how the electromagnetic ﬁeld
has to be transformed under a general change of the observer. Einstein solved
this problem by postulating that
The Maxwell equations are valid in each inertial system.
In particular, this implies the surprising fact that the velocity of light in a
vacuum, c, is the same in each inertial system. This forced Einstein to change
Newton’s classical mechanics and the classical thinking about space and time.
In Newton’s classical mechanics, the formula
x′ = x −vt,
y′ = y,
z′ = z
t′ = t
(2.36)
describes the transformation from a right-handed Cartesian (x, y, z)-system
to a right-handed Cartesian (x′, y′, z′)-system. Here, we assume that the ori-
gin of the (x′, y′, z′)-system moves with the constant positive velocity v along
the x-axis. At time t = 0, the two systems coincide. Einstein showed in 1905
that one has to replace the Galilei transformation (2.36) by the following
Lorentz transformation
x′ =
x −vt

,
y′ = y,
z′ = z,
t′ =

(2.37)
The point is that in contrast to classical mechanics, time is not an abso-
lute quantity in Einstein’s theory of special relativity, but it depends on the
choice of the inertial system used by the observer. If the velocity v is small
compared with the velocity c of light in vacuum, that is, v/c ≪1, then the
classical Galilei transformation (2.36) represents a good approximation of the
relativistic Lorentz transformation (2.37). Motivated by the singularity of the
Lorentz transformation (2.37) for v = c, Einstein postulated that
The maximal speed for the propagation of physical eﬀects is the speed
of light.
As a consequence of his new relativistic mechanics, Einstein obtained the
fundamental relation

E = m0c2
between the energy E and the rest mass m0 of a resting particle. This is
the most important law in physics, since it governs the energy production in
stars, for example, in the sun.
2.3.4 Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity
Newton’s theory of gravitation implies a propagation of gravitational eﬀects
with inﬁnite speed. This fact violates Einstein’s postulate on the existence
of a maximal signal velocity. To explain this, suppose that there occurs a
huge explosion at the center C of our Milky Way which changes the mass
of the center drastically. According to Newton, this explosion would change
immediately the orbit of the sun around C. Following Einstein, the light
needs 30 000 years from C to the sun, and hence the sun will notice the
explosion 30 000 years later. In the years from 1905 until 1915, Einstein made
strong eﬀorts to modify Newton’s theory of gravitation in such a way that
gravitational eﬀects propagate with the velocity of light in vacuum. In 1915
Einstein published his theory of general relativity. In this theory, Newton’s
gravitational force is replaced by the
Riemann curvature of the 4-dimensional space-time manifold.
This curvature is caused by the existing masses in the universe.
In Newton’s mechanics, the equations of motion for the planets are invari-
ant under 3-dimensional rotations (the group SO(3)). This leads to conser-
vation of angular momentum which implies that the orbits of planets lie in a
plane. In addition, the equations of motion possess an additional hidden sym-
metry which is related to 4-dimensional rotations (the group SO(4)). This
additional symmetry ﬁxes the axes of the elliptic orbits of the planets (Lenz
vector). In general relativity, the latter symmetry does not exist anymore.
Because of this symmetry breaking, the great semi-axis (perihelion) of Mer-
cury is not ﬁxed, but it rotates 43 arc seconds per century. This rotation was
discovered by Le Verrier (1811–1877). In contrast to Newtonian mechanics,
Einstein’s theory of general relativity yields precisely the observed motion of
the perihelion of Mercury. Moreover, Einstein’s theory of general relativity
implies
• the existence of black holes,
• the Big Bang,
• and the expansion of our universe.
As an introduction to Einstein’s theory of special and general relativity, we
recommend the author’s monograph Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV.

2.3.5 Einstein’s Light Particle Hypothesis
In his 1905 paper on the photoelectric eﬀect, Einstein postulated that
Electromagnetic waves possess particle properties, too.
Nowadays these light particles are called photons.21 According to Einstein, a
photon of frequency ν has the energy
E = hν
where h is Planck’s quantum of action. The perfect dualism between particles
and waves was postulated by de Broglie in 1924. In 1932 Tamm and Ivanenko
formulated the hypothesis that all fundamental forces in nature are related
to the exchange of ﬁeld quanta called messenger particles. The photon is
the messenger particle for the electromagnetic force. Einstein’s light particle
hypothesis was experimentally established by
• the photoelectric eﬀect (Millikan 1916), and
• the Compton eﬀect (Compton 1922).
For their contributions to the quantum physics of light particles, Einstein,
Millikan, and Compton were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1921,
1923, and 1927, respectively. Let us brieﬂy discuss the photoelectric eﬀect
ﬁrst investigated by Thomson and Lenard at the end of the 19th century. If
light hits a metal, then electrons are ejected.
(i) The classical picture. Each electron is bound in the metal by the average
binding energy U. In order to eject an electron, we need the light energy
E where
E > U.
The classical electromagnetic wave is able to eject electrons if the inten-
sity of the light is large enough. The frequency ν of light does not play
any role.
(ii) Einstein’s quantum picture. According to Einstein, light consists of light
particles (photons) of energy E = hν. Such a photon can only eject
an electron if its energy hν is larger than the binding energy U of the
electron. This means that
ν > νcrit
where νcrit := U/h. Consequently, the photoelectric eﬀect only occurs
above a threshold frequency, in contrast to (i).
The experiment veriﬁes case (ii).
Photons and gravitation. Photons do not have any rest mass. Never-
theless, they are aﬀected by gravitation. For example, light is deﬂected by the
21 The term ‘photon’ was introduced as the name for the particle of light, by the
physical chemist Gilbert Lewis, at Berkeley University (California) in 1926.

sun. In 1959, using the M¨oßbauer eﬀect (recoilless absorption of γ-quanta),
the red shift of light in the gravitational ﬁeld of earth was established in a
tower of height 22.5m at Harvard University in Boston, by Pound and Repka.
In 1928 Hubble discovered a red shift in the spectra of distant galaxies. This
red shift is caused by the expansion of our universe after the Big Bang. s
Photons and the early universe. In 1965 Penzias and Wilson dis-
covered a weak cosmic background microwave radiation which is a relict of
the Big Bang (Nobel prize in physics in 1978). In 1992, the ‘Cosmic Back-
ground Explorer (COBE)’ satellite sent data to earth which showed that the
background radiation is not perfectly anisotropic. This slightly anisotropic
structure of the background radiation is very important for understanding
the formation of galaxies in the early universe caused by energy ﬂuctuations.
More recent very precise measurements of the background radiation by the
WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropic Probe) experiment of NASA con-
tribute to a better understanding of the evolution of our universe after the
Big Bang (see page 80).
2.3.6 Rutherford’s Particle Scattering
Coulomb force. Consider a particle with positive electric charge Q, mass
m, and initial velocity vector v = ve1 which is scattered at a ﬁxed particle
with positive charge Q0, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Here, e1 is a ﬁxed unit vector.
The motion x = x(t) of the incoming particle is governed by the Newtonian
equation of motion
m¨x =
QQ0
4πε0||x||2 ·
x
||x||
with respect to the Coulomb force between the charges Q and Q0. The orbit
of the scattered particle is a hyperbola. Explicitly, if the distance between
the incoming particle and the x-axis is equal to d, then the scattering angle
ϑ is given by
d =
QQ0
4πε0mv2 cot ϑ
2 .
The proof of this classical result will be given in the chapter on the hydrogen
atom to be found in Volume II. The mathematics is the same as for the
motion of a comet scattered by the sun in celestial mechanics.22 The proof
is essentially based on conservation of energy and angular momentum. In
particular, if the scattering angle is equal to ϑ−∆ϑ, then the distance d+∆d
is given by
d + ∆d =
QQ0
4πε0mv2 cot ϑ −∆ϑ
2
.
22 Replace Q0, Q, and 1/4πε0 by the mass of the sun, the mass of the planet, and
the gravitational constant, respectively.

Diﬀerential cross section. Consider now a homogeneous current with
the velocity vector v = ve1 and particle number density ϱ. This corresponds
to the electric current density vector

of incoming particles. Let ∆N denote the number of incoming particles which,
during the time interval [0, t], are scattered about angles which lie in the
interval [ϑ, ϑ + ∆ϑ]. We then get the key formula for Coulomb scattering

To prove this, consider an annulus A perpendicular to the x-axis of radii d

interval [ϑ, ϑ + ∆ϑ].
The structure of atoms. Around 1910, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937)
performed scattering experiments in order to discover the structure of atoms.
He directed a beam of α-particles (generated by radioactive decay) to a thin
metal foil (e.g., gold), and he measured the distribution of the angle ϑ of the
scattered particles. This way, Rutherford discovered experimentally that an
atom consists of a nucleus and electrons. For his contributions to radioactive
chemistry, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1908.
In 1932, Chadwick discovered the neutron which has no electric charge. This
discovery clariﬁed the structure of the nucleus of atoms. The ﬁnal result reads
as follows.
• The nucleus of an atom consists of Z protons p and N neutrons n.
• The nucleus is surrounded by Z electrons e−.
Each electron e−has the negative electric charge −e, whereas each proton p
has the positive charge e. Here,
e = 1.602 · 10−19As.
The number Z of protons is called the atomic number. For example, the
hydrogen atom (Z = 1) consists of one proton and one electron. The helium
atom (Z = 2) consists of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. As
Rutherford discovered, α-particles are nuclei of the helium atom. For the rest
masses me, mp, mn of electron, proton, and neutron, respectively, we get
me = 9.108 · 10−31kg,
mp = 1 836 me,
mn = 1.009 mp .
Rutherford’s scattering experiments also proved that the radius of an atom
is about
r = 10−10m.
Nowadays we know the following:
• radius of the proton: 10−15m,
• radius of molecules: 10−9m −10−10m,
• radius of the nucleus: 10−14m −10−15m,
• radius of quarks and electrons: less than 10−18m.
2.3.7 The Cross Section for Compton Scattering
In order to investigate the properties of elementary particles, physicists per-
form scattering experiments. The most important quantity of a scattering
process is the cross section. There exist two important tasks for quantum
ﬁeld theory:

(ii) the computation of the rest energies of elementary particles (bound
states).
It turns out that the task (i) is much easier to handle than (ii), since we can
use the methods of perturbation theory pictured by Feynman diagrams. The
ultimate, extremely ambitious goal is the creation of a theory which predicts
the existence and properties (e.g., the masses and the magnetic moments) of
all fundamental particles and forces in nature.
Compton scattering. In each scattering process, physicists measure the
crucial cross section σ. In 1929, for the cross section of the Compton scattering
of light at crystals, Klein and Nishina computed the formula
σ =

with

(2.39)
where β := λin/λout. Here, we use the following notation:
• me mass of the electron, −e charge of the electron,
• λin (resp. λout) wave length of the incoming (resp. outgoing) photon,
• h Planck’s quantum of action,
• Compton wave length of the electron

Fig. 2.10. Cross section for the Compton scattering of light
We integrate over the unit sphere S2 with the scattering angle ϑ and the
surface element
dΩ= cos ϑ dϑdϕ
where the geographic latitude ϑ and the geographic longitude ϕ vary in the
interval [−π/2, π/2] and [−π, π], respectively. The diﬀerential
dσ := f(ϑ)dΩ
and the integral σ =

S2 dσ are called the diﬀerential cross section and the
total cross section, respectively.
The famous Klein–Nishina formula (2.39) shows that Compton scatter-
ing is a second-order eﬀect with respect to the ﬁne structure constant α.

which was obtained by Joseph John Thomson at the end of the 19th century.23
Observe that this classical approximation formula does not depend on the
scattering angle ϑ. Physicists measure cross sections in barns. By deﬁnition,
1 barn = 10−28m2.
Physical interpretation of the cross section. Let us now discuss the
physical meaning of the cross section σ. Consider the situation pictured in
Figure 2.10. We choose a suﬃciently large sphere S2
R of radius R about the
scattering center. Let n and ∆S be the outer normal unit vector and the
surface element of the sphere S2
R, respectively. The incoming photon stream
can be described by the energy current density vector
23 This can be found in the standard textbook on electrodynamics by Jackson
(1975).

118
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
jin = ϱinvin
where ϱin and vin denote the energy density and the velocity vector, respec-
tively. In a typical experiment, the incoming photon stream is homogeneous.
Therefore, we assume that the vector jin is constant. By the scattering pro-
cess, we obtain the outgoing energy current density vector ﬁeld
jout = ϱoutvout
which depends on the position vector x, but not on time. Now to the point.
The decisive quantity
E = (t1 −t0)

S2
R
joutn dS
(2.40)
is equal to the amount of outgoing energy that ﬂows through the sphere S2
R
during the time interval [t0, t1]. This amount of energy can be measured by
experiment. Naturally enough, E is proportional to ||jin|| (incoming energy
ﬂow). The coeﬃcient of proportionality σ deﬁned by
E = σ(t1 −t0) ||jin||
(2.41)
has the physical dimension of area (m2). Therefore, σ is called the total cross
section of the scattering process. We want to show that there exists a function
f such that
σ =

S2
R
f(ϕ, ϑ)dΩ.
(2.42)
In fact, from (2.40) and (2.41) we get
σ =

S2
R
joutn
||jin|| dS.
Naturally enough, the outgoing energy E does not depend on the choice of the
radius R if the radius is suﬃciently large. Because of the equality dS = R2dΩ,
we assume that the product R2jout does not depend on R, and hence
(joutn)(P)
||jin||
= f(ϕ, ϑ),
P ∈S2
R
where ϕ and ϑ are the geographic longitude and the geographic latitude of
the point P, respectively. This implies the desired formula (2.42).
Concerning Rutherford’s experiment on the scattering of α-particles at
protons (Fig. 2.8 on page 114), observe that it does not make any sense
to consider the total cross section in this case, since the integral

S2
R fdΩ

2.3 Historical Background
119
is divergent. Therefore, we need a localized version ∆σ of the cross section
called the diﬀerential cross section. The idea is to consider a regular subset
S of the sphere S2
R that surrounds the point P ∈S2
R. We now measure the
scattered energy ﬂow that passes through the part S of the sphere S2
R. The
quantity
E(S) := (t1 −t0)

S
joutn dS
is equal to the amount of outgoing energy that ﬂows through the part S of
the sphere S2
R during the time interval [t0, t1]. Similarly as above, we deﬁne
the cross section σ(S) with respect to S by the relation
E(S) = σ(S)(t1 −t0) ||jin||.
Hence σ(S) =

S f(ϕ, ϑ)dΩ. Contracting the set S to the point P ∈S2
R, we

Compton eﬀect and quantum electrodynamics. The Klein–Nishina
formula (2.39) for the cross section of the Compton eﬀect can be obtained
from quantum electrodynamics. This highlight of quantum electrodynamics
will be thoroughly studied in Volume II. Quantum electrodynamics represents
a quantum ﬁeld theory which describes the interactions between electrons,
positrons, and photons. This is a perturbation theory with respect to the ﬁne
structure constant
α =
1
137.04.
The smallness of the ﬁne structure constant is responsible for the great success
of perturbation theory in quantum electrodynamics. We will show in Volume
II that the Klein–Nishina formula follows from using second-order Feynman
diagrams along with time-consuming computations based on Dirac matrices.
Observe that the Klein–Nishina formula does not depend on the polarization
of the photons. In fact, this formula averages over the polarizations of the
incoming photons and sums over the polarizations of the outgoing photons.
General cross sections in elementary particle physics. The def-
inition of total cross section σ and diﬀerential cross section dσ introduced
in (2.41ﬀ) above applies to all types of scattering processes in physics. In
particle accelerators, one deﬁnes cross sections with respect to the particle
number. In this case, the incoming particle stream is described by the particle
number current density vector,

where ϱin and vin denote the particle density and the velocity vector, re-

particle number N.
2.3.8 Bohr’s Model of the Hydrogen Atom
In 1922 Sommerfeld asked me whether I would be willing to follow him
to a meeting in G¨ottingen at which Bohr would present his theory. These
days in G¨ottingen we now always refer to the “Bohr festival”. There for
the ﬁrst time I learned how a man like Bohr worked on problems of atomic
physics.24
Werner Heisenberg, 1968
Many properties of atoms, molecules, stars, and galaxies can be detected by
measuring the energy spectrum of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from
such objects. In 1884, the physicist Balmer tried to ﬁnd a mathematical rela-
tion between the measured wave lengths λ in the spectrum of the hydrogen
atom. By trial and guesswork, he found out that
λ = const ·
m2
m2 −4
for
m = 3, 4, 5.
This is a discrete sequence for the wave length. A few years later, Rydberg
and Ritz postulated that all the possible values of the wave length observed
in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom are given by the following empirical
formula
λnm = 2πc
ωnm
,
n < m,
n, m = 1, 2, . . .
where
ωnm := R
	 1
n2 −1
m2

.
(2.43)
The experiment yields the value R = 2.07·1016s−1; this is called the Rydberg
frequency. In 1911, based on scattering experiments, Rutherford formulated
the hypothesis that each atom consists of electrons which surround the nu-
cleus like the planets surround the sun. In 1913 Bohr postulated the following
for the hydrogen atom.
(i) The hydrogen atom consists of one electron which travels around the
nucleus (one proton) in a circular orbit (Fig. 2.11(a)).
24 Heisenberg’s lecture about the history of quantum mechanics can be found in
the collection of lectures edited by A. Salam (1968).

(ii) The angular momentum a of the electron is quantized, that is,
a = nℏ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
where h is Planck’s quantum of action and ℏ:= h/2π.
(iii) If the electron jumps from an orbit with energy En to an orbit with
lower energy Em, the energy diﬀerence
∆E = En −Em
is emitted by electromagnetic radiation. According to Einstein’s light
quanta hypothesis, the angular frequency ω of the emitted light quantum
(photon) is given by
∆E = ℏω.
This implies the fundamental energy-frequency relation
ωnm = En −Em
ℏ
.
(2.44)
From this we get the cocycle relation
ωnm + ωmk + ωkn = 0
for all
n, m, k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
From the mathematical point of view, the cocycle relation shows that the
emitted frequencies of the hydrogen atom have a cohomological structure.
This observation was the crucial starting point of Heisenberg’s ingenious ap-
proach to quantum mechanics in 1924. In fact, Heisenberg spoke about the
Ritz combination principle, but not on cohomology which was unknown at
that time. As a crucial topological tool, cohomology only emerged in the
1930s.
In order to discuss Bohr’s model, let En, rn, and vn denote energy, ra-
dius, and velocity of the nth orbit of the electron. We will show below that
postulates (i) through (iii) imply

and
vn = αc
n ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Recall the deﬁnition of both the ﬁne structure constant
α :=

4πε0ℏc =

137.04
and the Compton wave length of the electron, λe :=
h
mec. Here, we use the
following notations: e charge of the proton, −e charge of the electron, mp
mass of the proton, me mass of the electron, ε0 electric ﬁeld constant of
vacuum.
From (2.45) along with (iii) we obtain immediately the Rydberg–Ritz
formula (2.43). For the smallest orbit we get the energy
E1 = −13.6eV.
The electron is bound to the nucleus with this energy. Note that this energy
is needed in order to ionize the hydrogen atom, that is, to eject the electron.
Moreover, this gives the order of magnitude for the energies which occur in
chemical reactions per atom. The radius of the smallest orbit
r1 = 5 · 10−11m
is called the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom. Recall that 1 nm = 10−9m
(nanometer) and 1 fm = 10−15m (femtometer). The radius of the proton
rproton = 1.4 · 10−15m
is much less than the Bohr radius. If we represent the proton by a pea of
radius 5mm, then the electron would surround the pea at a distance of 30m.
In addition, the mass quotient
mp
me
= 1836
shows that the proton is much heavier than the electron. The speed
v1 = αc =
c
137.04
of the electron on the smallest orbit is much less than the velocity of light
c. Therefore, relativistic eﬀects do not play any role in Bohr’s atomic model.
Equivalently, formula (2.45) can be written as
En = −mec2α2
2n2
,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Here, mec2 is the rest energy of the electron.

2.3 Historical Background
123
Let us now prove the claim (2.45). The motion of the electron around the
proton on a circle of radius r is described by the equation
x = r(cos ωt i + sin ωt j)
where i, j are ﬁxed right-handed orthonormal vectors. Hence
˙x(t) = ωr(−sin ωt i + cos ωt j)
and
¨x(t) = −ω2r(cos ωt i + sin ωt j).
As usual, the dot denotes the time derivative. For the angular momentum of
the electron, we obtain
L = me(x × ˙x) = meωr2k
where k := i × j. There act two attractive forces between the proton and the
electron, namely, Newton’s gravitational force
FN = −Gmpme
r2
· x
r
and the electrostatic Coulomb force
FC = −
e2
4πε0r2 · x
r .
Here r := ||x||. Since ||FN||/||FC|| = 5 · 10−42, the gravitational force can
be neglected. Thus, the motion of the electron is governed by the Newton
equation
me¨x = FC.
Hence
meω2r =
e2
4πε0r2 .

E = me

Bohr postulated that the angular momentum only attains the following quan-
tized values
||L|| = nℏ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
This gives meωr2 = nℏfor n = 1, 2, . . . From (2.46) we obtain the orbit radii
rn = r1n2,
n = 1, 2, . . .
with r1 := 4πε0ℏ2/mee2 = λe/2πα. The energy is given by

and the orbital velocity is equal to vn = || ˙x|| = ωrn = αc/n.
The Bohr model described the observed spectrum of the hydrogen atom
in a perfect manner. However, physicists did not understand this model for
the following reason. In terms of classical electrodynamics, the rotating elec-
tron represents an accelerated electric charge. Such a charge steadily loses
energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, the electron cannot
move on stable orbits. In addition, classical physics cannot explain why the
electron jumps spontaneously from one orbit to another one. This fundamen-
tal problem was solved by Heisenberg in 1925 and Schr¨odinger in 1926, by
introducing quantum mechanics, namely, Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and
Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics, respectively. In terms of Schr¨odinger’s wave
mechanics, the wave function of the electron of the hydrogen atom performs
eigenoscillations which correspond to Bohr’s semiclassical circular orbits. In
1927 Heisenberg discovered the crucial quantum-mechanical uncertainty re-
lation which tells us that
The electron is a quantum particle for which the classical notions of
position and velocity do not make sense anymore.
2.3.9 Einstein’s Radiation Law and Laser Beams
In 1917 Einstein wrote a fundamental paper on the quantum theory of radia-
tion.25 Let us explain the basic ideas. Consider N atoms where each of them
can be in a state of energy E0, E1, E2, . . . There exist the following three
fundamental processes.
(i) Spontaneous emission: The atom passes spontaneously from the energy
En to the lower energy Em by emitting a photon of angular frequency
ω = En −Em
ℏ
.
(2.48)
Here, we assume that En > Em.
(ii) Stimulated absorption: Suppose that the atom is embedded into an ex-
ternal electromagnetic ﬁeld of energy density η(T ). This stimulates the
atom to jump from the energy Em to the higher energy En by absorbing
a photon of angular frequency (2.48).
(iii) Stimulated emission: The energy density η(T ) also stimulates jumps of
the atom from the energy En to the lower energy Em. In this case the
atom emits a photon of angular frequency (2.48).

(1917), 121–135. The English translation of this paper can be found in van der
Waerden (1968), pp. 63–68.

2.3 Historical Background
125
We assume that the energy density η(T ) refers to the absolute temperature
T and to electromagnetic waves whose angular frequencies lie in the small
interval [ω, ω + ∆ω]. In order to describe the situation quantitatively, con-
sider a large system of N atoms at absolute temperature T . According to
Boltzmann statistics, Einstein assumed that at each ﬁxed time t, the number
of atoms of energy En is equal to
Nn(t) = Ne−En/kT .
At the later time t + ∆t, we get
Nn(t + ∆t) = Nn(t) −Nn(t)(ωnm∆ω)∆t −
−Nn(t)(ωstim
nm η(T ))∆t + Nm(t)(Astim
nm η(T ))∆t,
up to higher-order terms of the form o(∆t) as ∆t →0. The coeﬃcient Enm
describes the spontaneous emission of photons whereas Estim
nm
and Astim
nm de-
scribe the stimulated emission and absorption of photons, respectively. In
thermodynamic equilibrium, Einstein assumed that the energy jumps of the
atom from En to Em and from Em to En do not change the number of atoms
at the energy level En. Hence
Nn(t + ∆t) = Nn(t).
This implies the Einstein relation
Nn(t)

Enm∆ω + η(T ) Estim

= Nm(t)η(T ) Astim

Hence
e−(En−Em)/kT

Introducing the angular frequency ω of the emitted photon, En −Em = ℏω,
we get
e−ℏω/kT
	Enm∆ω
η(T )
+ Estim

= Astim
nm .
(2.49)
Assuming that η(T ) →+∞as T →+∞, we obtain the Einstein relation
Estim

mn .
This tells us that the coeﬃcients of stimulated emission and stimulated ab-
sorption coincide. Moreover, for the energy density η(T ) of the external elec-
tromagnetic radiation, it follows from (2.49) that
η(T ) =
Enm∆ω

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
Let us compare this with the energy density of photons following from
Planck’s radiation law (2.24) on page 103,

(2.51)
From (2.50) and (2.51) we get
Enm = ℏω3
π2c3 · Estim

(2.52)
This equation shows the relation between spontaneous and stimulated emis-
sion of photons of angular frequency ω.
The term “laser” stands for “light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of
radiation.” The ﬁrst lasers were realized experimentally around 1960. In 1964
Basov, Prochorov, and Townes were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for
“fundamental work in the ﬁeld of quantum electronics, which has led to the
construction of oscillators and ampliﬁers based on the maser-laser principle.”
Theoretically, the laser is based on Einstein’s 1917 paper discussed above.
In 1927 Dirac wrote a fundamental paper on emission and absorption
of radiation where he showed that Einstein’s radiation law follows from the
new quantum theory due to Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger from 1925 and 1926,
respectively. Dirac’s paper is part of a collection edited by Schwinger (1958)
which contains the most important papers in quantum electrodynamics. See
also the classic textbooks by Dirac (1930) and Heitler (1936). The modern
quantum radiation theory can be found in Pike and Sarkar (1995) and Mandel
and Wolf (1995) (laser theory).
2.3.10 Quantum Computers
In order to speed up computers, physicists are thinking about the realization
of quantum computers based on the laws of quantum physics. The basic idea
is to use the fact that there exist superpositions of quantum states ϕ and ψ
given by
αϕ + βψ
where α and β are complex numbers. This leads to ‘quantum bits’ called
qbits
which transport an essentially higher amount of information than can be
done by using traditional ‘bits’. We will study this in Volume IV on quantum
mathematics. Many strange properties of quantum information are based on
the existence of composed entangled states
ϕ ⊗ψ ± ψ ⊗ϕ
where the single states ϕ and ψ lose their individuality. As an introduction
to quantum information, we recommend Boumeester, Ekert, and Zeilinger
(2000), Nielsen and Chuang (2001), and Heiss (2002).

2.4 The Standard Model in Particle Physics
I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to
have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself
now and then ﬁnding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary,
whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
Isaac Newton (1643–1727)
It is our goal to study the basic ideas of the Standard Model in terms of
physics.
2.4.1 The Four Fundamental Forces in Nature
In the 20th century, physicists used radioactive decay, cosmic rays, and more
and more powerful particle accelerators in order to get a fairly complete
picture of the structure of matter. Nowadays physicists assume that there
exist the following four fundamental forces in nature.
(i) Strong force (e.g., the proton as a bound state of three quarks).
(ii) Electromagnetic force (e.g., the chemical binding of molecules).
(iii) Weak force (e.g., the β-decay of the neutron).
(iv) Gravitational force (e.g., the motion of planets around the sun, the ex-
pansion of the universe, and black holes).
Some important properties of these forces are summarized in Table 2.1. As
we will see below, the electromagnetic force and the weak force are part of a
uniﬁed force called the electroweak force.
Strong force. The nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the
proton and for the relative stability of the neutron and the atomic nucleus,
which consists of protons and neutrons (nucleons). The range of the strong
force is equal to the diameter of the proton, namely, 1 fermi = 10−15m.

The proton consists of two u quarks and one d quark, whereas the neutron
consists of two d quarks and one u quark. The proton p is the nucleus of the
hydrogen atom. The neutron was discovered experimentally by Chadwick in
1932 (Nobel prize in physics in 1935). In 1932 Ivanenko predicted that the
nucleus consists of protons and neutrons.
Electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force is responsible for the
stability of atoms and molecules by acting on the protons and electrons of
the atoms. All physical and chemical properties of solid states, liquids, and
gases are based on the electromagnetic force. The range of the electromag-
netic force is inﬁnite. The electron was discovered by Thomson in 1895 who
investigated cathode rays (Nobel prize in physics in 1906). If electrons hit
a metal, electromagnetic rays of high energy are generated. These so-called
X-rays were discovered by R¨ontgen in 1895 (ﬁrst Nobel prize in physics in
1901). A semiclassical model of the atom was formulated by Bohr in 1913
(Nobel prize in physics in 1922). Bohr was strongly inﬂuenced by Ruther-
ford’s scattering experiments performed in the years 1909–1911. The ﬁnal
model of the atom was based on quantum mechanics invented by Heisenberg
in 1925 (Nobel prize in physics in 1932) and Schr¨odinger in 1926 (Nobel prize
in physics together with Dirac in 1933). The shell structure of the atom can
only be understood by using the electron spin and Pauli’s exclusion principle
for fermions (e.g., electrons) from 1926. Pauli was awarded the Nobel prize
in physics in 1945.
Weak force. This force is responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms
discovered by Bequerel in 1892 (Nobel prize in physics together with Marie
and Pierre Curie in 1903). The basic reaction is the β-decay of the neutron,
n →p + e−+ νe.
That is, the neutron n decays into one proton p, one electron e−, and one
anti-electron neutrino νe. The mean lifetime of the neutron is 15 minutes.
Experiments show that the mean lifetime of the proton is larger than 1032
years. This is an incredibly huge number.26 The existence of the neutrino was
26 Note that the age of our universe is 13.7·109 years.

2.4 The Standard Model in Particle Physics

predicted by Pauli in 1933 in order to guarantee momentum conservation in
the neutron decay. Radioactive decay and the chemical properties of radioac-
tive substances were studied around 1900 by Marie Curie (Nobel prizes in
physics and chemistry in 1903 and 1911, respectively), Pierre Curie (Nobel
prize in physics in 1903), and Rutherford (Nobel prize in physics in 1908).
These three scientists found out that radioactive decay generates three types
of rays:
• α-rays (helium nuclei 4
2He),
• β-rays (fast electrons),
• γ-rays (high-energy photons).
Visible light has a wave length between 4 · 10−7m and 8 · 10−7m. In contrast
to this, X-rays and γ-rays have a short wave length of 10−10m and 10−13m,
respectively. The energy of X-rays and γ-rays is much stronger than the
energy of light rays. Note that the energy of photons increases if the wave
length decreases. Cosmic rays were discovered by Hess in 1911 (Nobel prize
in physics in 1936). In 1928 Gamow explained the production of α-rays.
If α-particles would be classical particles, they could not leave the nucleus
because of the existence of a strong potential barrier. Therefore, it is crucial
that α-particles are quantum particles. They possess stochastic properties. In
particular, they can leave the nucleus by “tunnelling” the potential barrier. In
1934 Fermi used slow neutrons in order to produce new radioactive elements
containing a large number of nucleons. Fermi was awarded the Nobel prize
in physics in 1938.
The neutrino was experimentally discovered outside a nuclear reactor in
1956. At the Savannah River reactor (Georgia, U.S.A.), the number of neu-
trinos emerging per second was extremely high, and physicists waited with
their detector until they eventually detected some. Other neutrino sources
are our sun and outbursts of supernovae. Note that the energy production
of the sun is based on a series of nuclear reactions which converts hydrogen
into helium. These reactions start by the process
p + p →2
1D + e+ + νe.
Here, the fusion of two protons yields one deuteron 2
1D plus one positron e+
and one electron neutrino νe. This process is caused by the weak force.27 For
his theory of the energy production in stars, Bethe was awarded the Nobel
prize in physics in 1967. Neutrinos coming from the sun were detected by
Davies in 1970. In 1987, a supernova explosion took place about 160 000
27 The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons called nucleons. The
symbol N
Z A stands for the nucleus of an atom that consists of N nucleons and Z
protons. Hence the number of neutrons is equal to N −Z.
The symbol e−(resp. e+) tells us that the electron (resp. positron) has the
negative (resp. positive) elementary electric charge −e (resp. e). Similarly, Z0
tells us that the Z-boson has no electric charge.

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
light years away in the Magellanic Cloud next to our Milky Way galaxy. This
star had 8 sun masses. The released energy was enormous,
E = 1046J.
More then 99% of energy came out in invisible form – as neutrinos – based
on the reaction
e−+ p →n + νe.
Two experimental groups in the United States and Japan reported detect-
ing neutrinos at the time of the supernova. The experimental detection of
neutrinos is a highly nontrivial task, since their interaction with matter is
extremely weak.
Phase transitions of the fundamental forces in the early uni-
verse. Many physicists assume that there was only one fundamental force
at the time of the Big Bang. The cooling of the universe was responsible for
phase transitions of this fundamental force which led to a splitting into the
four fundamental forces observed in nature today.
2.4.2 The Fundamental Particles in Nature
Basic ideas of the Standard Model. The Standard Model in elementary
particle physics concerns the strong, weak, and electromagnetic force. The
main idea of the Standard Model is the following.
(a) Fundamental particles. There exist precisely 12 fundamental particles in
nature, namely, the 6 quarks u, d, c, s, t, b and the 6 leptons
e−(electron), µ−(muon), τ−(tauon), νe, νµ, ντ (3 neutrinos).
These 12 fundamental particles are fermions (i.e., they have half-integer
spin,
1
2ℏ.) For the six quarks u, d, c, s, t, b, physicists invented fancy
names. They call them up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom
quarks, respectively. The 12 fundamental particles are divided into three
generations:
First generation: u, d, e−, νe.
Second generation: c, s, µ−, νµ.
Third generation: t, b, τ −, ντ.
(b) Messenger particles. The 12 fundamental particles experience the three
fundamental forces (strong, electromagnetic, and weak) by the exchange
of 12 messenger particles, namely,
γ (the photon), W +, W −, Z0 (3 weak gauge bosons), and 8 gluons.
These 12 messenger particles are bosons (integer spin, 0, ℏ). The 8 gluons
provide the “glue” for keeping the quarks together.

(c) Antiparticles. To each fundamental particle, there exists an antiparticle
of same mass and opposite electric charge. The 12 antiparticles are de-
noted in the following way.
First generation: u, d (antiquarks), e+ (positron), νe (anti-electron neu-
trino).
Second generation: c, s (antiquarks), µ+ (antimuon), νµ (anti-muon neu-
trino).
Third generation: t, b (antiquarks), τ + (antitauon), ντ (anti-tau neu-
trino).
It is a typical property of our universe that matter highly dominates antimat-
ter. In 1928 Dirac used his relativistic equation for the electron in order to
predict the existence of the antiparticle e+ to the electron e−. This particle
(called positron) was experimentally discovered in a Wilson cloud chamber in
1932 by Anderson (Nobel prize in physics in 1936). The antiproton p was dis-
covered by Chamberlain and Segr´e in 1955 (Nobel prize in physics in 1959),
and the antineutron was found by Cook in 1956.
Let us now discuss some more details of the Standard Model in particle
physics. A thorough investigation of the physics of the Standard Model can
be found in Volume V.
Strong force and the eight gluons. As a typical example, the proton
p consists of two u quarks and one d quark. Symbolically, p = uud. The rest
mass m0 of a proton is equal to

m0 = 1.67 · 10−27 kg.
This corresponds to the rest energy E = m0c2 = 1.5 · 10−18J. Physicists like
to measure energies in eV (electron volt). In this energy scale, the rest energy
of the proton is equal to
E = 0.938 · 109 eV.
As a rule of thumb, the rest energy of a proton is equal to 1 GeV (giga
electron volt), and this equals the rest energy of 1836 electrons. Physi-
cists use the preﬁxes giga, mega, nano, femto for the corresponding factors
109, 106, 10−9, 10−15. For more information, see Table A.1 on page 935.
In 2008, the particle accelerator at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland)28 will
reach particle energies which equal the rest energy of 7 000 protons (7TeV).
The radius of the proton is equal to 10−15m = 1 fermi. Experiments show
that electrons and quarks have a radius which is less than 0.001 fermi. In
fact, nowadays the electron and the six quarks are considered to be point-like
particles. Observe that most space of the proton is ﬁlled with massless gluons.
Each quark has three charges called red, green, and blue by physicists. The
gluons see the color charge. The action of gluons onto the color charge causes
the strong force. There are 8 gluons. As we will see later on, this depends on
the fact that the dimension of the Lie algebra su(3) is equal to 8. Since the
strong force is based on the color charge, the theory of the strong force is
called quantum chromodynamics. An atom has a radius of 10−10m = 100 000
fermi. Therefore, the strong force does not play any role for the interaction
between the electrons and the nucleus of an atom.
28 CERN stands for Conseil Europ´een pour la Recherche Nucl´eaire (European Or-
ganization for Nuclear Research at Geneva); this was founded in 1953.

2.4 The Standard Model in Particle Physics
133
The total rest energy of the three quarks of the proton is equal to 30MeV.
Consider the rough form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation
∆x · ∆p ∼ℏ.
The quark moves in a proton of radius ∆x = 10−15m. Therefore, the quark
has the momentum ∆p = ℏ/∆x, and the total energy
E =

m2
0c4 + c2(∆p)2 = 200 MeV.
Hence the total energy of the three quarks of the proton is equal to 0.6 GeV.
The remaining energy 0.4 GeV of the proton corresponds to the motion of
gluons. This means that the proton has an extremely large binding energy of
quarks which cannot be computed with the usual methods of perturbation
theory. Physicists use highly specialized supercomputers in order to compute
the binding energy of the proton, the neutron, and mesons. Mathematically,
the computations are based on grid models in the framework of gauge lattice
theory. The results are in good agreement with experiments.
Baryons and mesons as composite particles. An elementary parti-
cle is called a hadron iﬀit experiences the strong force. Quarks are elemen-
tary hadrons. Concerning composite hadrons, one has to distinguish between
baryons and mesons.
• Each baryon consists of three quarks (e.g., the proton, the neutron, the
lambda, and the sigma). Baryons have half-integer spin.
• Each meson consists of quark-antiquark pairs (e.g., the three mesons
π+, π0, π−or the kaon K0). Mesons have integer spin.
The existence of mesons, which have about 250 electron masses (or 1/7 of
the proton mass), was predicted by Yukawa in 1935 (Nobel prize in physics
in 1949). Experimentally, mesons were discovered in cosmic rays by Powell
in 1947 (Nobel prize in physics in 1950). Baryons and mesons are white,
that is, the color charges red, green, and blue neutralize each other so that
we cannot see the color charges. Only the gluons can see the color charges.
The existence of gluons was experimentally veriﬁed at the DESY accelerator
PETRA (Hamburg, Germany) in 1979.
Electroweak force, the photon, and the three weak gauge bosons.
Maxwell’s classical theory of electromagnetism from 1864 uniﬁed the electric
force with the magnetic force into the electromagnetic force. In the Standard
Model of particle physics, the electromagnetic force is uniﬁed with the weak
force. This yields the so-called electroweak force. The corresponding messen-
ger particles are the photon γ and the three weak gauge bosons W −, W +,
and Z0. As we will show later on, the appearance of 4 bosons depends on
the fact that the dimension of the Lie algebra u(1)×su(2) is equal to 4. The

describes the decay of a d quark into a u quark, an electron, and an anti-
electron neutrino. This decay is caused by the exchange of a W −-boson (Fig.
2.12). Since we have n = ddu and p = uud for the neutron and proton,
respectively, the process (2.53) is responsible for the crucial beta decay of the
neutron n →p + e−+ νe.
Lifetime of elementary particles. As a rule of thumb, physicists use
the formula
∆t =
ℏ
m0c2
for the lifetime, ∆t, of an elementary particle. This is a consequence of the
energy-time uncertainty mentioned on page 142. Here, h, c, and m0 denote
Planck’s constant, the velocity of light in a vacuum, and the rest mass of the
particle, respectively. Recall that ℏ:= h/2π. In particular, massless particles
like the photon, the gluon, and the graviton have an inﬁnite lifetime. If a
messenger particle has the lifetime ∆t, then it can move the distance r during
its lifetime. This tells us that the range of the corresponding force is equal to
r = c · ∆t =
ℏ
m0c.
This is equal to the so-called reduced Compton wave length λC of the particle.
Since the weak gauge bosons W ± and Z0 have a rest mass of about 100
GeV/c2, their lifetime is 10−23s, and the range of the weak force is less than
0.01 fermi = 10−17m.
The quark conﬁnement. Note that there exists a fundamental diﬀer-
ence between the electromagnetic force and the strong force (Fig. 2.13).
• The electromagnetic force vanishes for large distances and it goes to inﬁnity
if the distance goes to zero.
• In contrast to this, the strong force vanishes if the distance between the
quarks goes to zero and it becomes inﬁnite if the distance between the
quarks goes to inﬁnity.
This implies the crucial fact that the quarks behave like free particles for
small distances less than 0.2 fermi = 0.2 · 10−15m (asymptotic freedom). For

large. This property of the strong force is responsible for the fact that free
quarks have never been observed. This is the so-called quark conﬁnement. A
complete theoretical understanding of the quark conﬁnement is still missing.
History of the Standard Model of particle physics. The quark hy-
pothesis was formulated by Gell-Mann in 1964 (Nobel prize in physics in
1969). A similar theory was independently proposed by Zweig in 1964. In
Zweig’s approach the quarks were called aces. In the very beginning of his
theory, Gell-Mann was not sure whether the quarks are merely mathematical
constructions (based on the representation theory of the group SU(3)) or
real physical objects. The breakthrough came from physical experiments. In
1968, deeply inelastic electron-proton scattering experiments were performed
at SLAC of Stanford University (California, U.S.A.). These experiments es-
tablished that the proton possesses an internal structure which corresponds
to a decomposition of the proton into three quarks.
The ﬁrst theory of the weak force (β-decay) dates back to Fermi in 1933.
This model worked successfully for fairly low energies. In particular, Fermi
was able to compute the cross sections for neutrino reactions. Since the in-
ﬁnities of Fermi’s quantum ﬁeld theory could not be renormalized, physicists
were looking for an improved theory. In 1967 and 1968, Weinberg and Salam,
respectively, formulated independently a model which uniﬁed the weak and
electromagnetic force. They based their models in part on work developed
by Glashow in 1961. Therefore, this model is called the Glashow–Salam–
Weinberg model (in 1979 Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg were awarded the
Nobel prize in physics). The sophisticated renormalization of this model was
shown by ’t Hooft in 1971 (Nobel prize in physics together with Veltman
in 1999). He used mathematical tools developed for Feynman integrals by
Faddeev and Popov in the 1960s (cancellation of ghosts by factorizing with
respect to gauge orbits). In 1974, the reaction
p + νµ →n + π+ + νµ
was observed at Argonne National Laboratory. This process is based on the

Salam–Weinberg model. This model was ﬁnally established experimentally
by the discovery of the three weak gauge bosons W ± and Z0 at the CERN
particle accelerator (Geneva, Switzerland) in 1983. This experiment needs
very high energies, since the W and Z bosons have a rest mass of approxi-
mately 100 proton masses. Rubbia and van der Meer were awarded the 1984
Nobel prize in physics for performing this fundamental experiment, together
with a large group of experimentalists at the CERN proton-antiproton col-
lider. The particles of the Standard Model were discovered in the following
years:
• Free leptons: electron (1895), muon (1937), electron neutrino (1956), muon
neutrino (1961), tauon (1975), tauon neutrino (1975).
• Bound quarks: u, d, s (1970), c (1974), b (1977), t (1994).
• Messenger particles: photon (1922), gluons (1979), three weak gauge bosons
(1983).
• Composite particles: proton (1914), neutron (1932), π-meson (1947), and
J/ϕ-meson (1974).
• Antiparticles: anti-electron (positron) (1932), antiproton (1955), antineu-
tron (1956).
These particles have the following lifetimes: photon and gluon (∞), u quark
and proton (> 1032 years), electron (> 1023 years), d quark and neutron
(887s), muon (10−6s), s quark (10−8s), c and b quark (10−12s), Z and W ±
bosons (10−25s), t quark (10−25s). Nowadays physicists know about 80 com-
posite particles.
Gravitational waves and the graviton. If we assume that all of the
fundamental forces in nature are based on the exchange of messenger par-
ticles, then we have to postulate the existence of an additional messenger
particle called graviton which is responsible for the gravitational force. This
is not a pure speculation. Let us discuss this. In 1974 Hulse and Taylor ob-
served the pulsar PSR 1913+16 which has a distance of 20 000 light years
from earth (Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in
1993). This pulsar consists of two neutron stars. Each of them has 1.4 sun
masses and a diameter of approximately 20 km. This means that the mass
density is very large. The pulsation period of 0.0590299952709 seconds un-
dergoes a periodic change because of the companion star. This is one of the
stablest clocks in the universe. The two stars slowly approach each other
because of a loss of gravitational energy due to gravitational radiation. On
the basis of a post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity, computa-
tions verify a number of predictions, including the formula for the energy loss
from a binary system due to gravitational radiation.29 Observe that Hulse
and Taylor established the existence of gravitational waves only in an indi-
rect manner. In the near future, physicists will perform highly sensitive laser
experiments in order to prove directly the existence of gravitational waves.
29 This can be found in Straumann (2004).

The idea is the following. If a gravitational wave hits a mirror, then the small
change of the mirror position can be observed by the small deﬂection of a
laser beam of length between 500 meters (in Germany) and some kilometers
(the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) project
in the United States of America). In the future, it is planned to use spacelabs
where the eﬀective distance is about ﬁve million kilometers (the LISA (Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna) project to be launched by NASA and ESA
in about 2011).30 Right now extensive computer simulations are being per-
formed in order to understand the pattern of the gravitational waves caused
by supernova explosions or the collision of two black holes (resp. two col-
lapsing binary neutron stars). Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts
that gravitational waves propagate with the speed of light and they have
two diﬀerent directions of polarization. Therefore, the hypothetical massless
graviton of spin 2 should propagate with the speed of light.
String theory and the graviton. In the 1970s a true revolution took
place in the thinking of theoretical physicists. Up to this time, it was assumed
that the fundamental constituents of matter are particles. In contrast to this,
modern string theory is based on the following fascinating hypothesis:
Elementary particles are not point-particles, but they are tiny strings
living below the Planck length l = 10−35m.
The motion of a point-particle (resp. string) corresponds to a 1-dimensional
world-line (resp. 2-dimensional world-sheet) (Fig. 2.14). There exists a very
rich mathematical theory of 2-dimensional surfaces called Riemann surfaces.
It is typical for Riemann surfaces that they possess a conformal structure.
This explains why conformal ﬁeld theory is closely related to string theory.
Note the following important fact:
The larger the symmetry of a physical system is, the more infor-
mation about the structure of the system can be obtained from the
mathematics of the relevant symmetry group.
In contrast to other dimensions, the two-dimensional (local) conformal group
is huge. This is reﬂected by the richness of the classical theory of analytic
functions on the complex plane. For example, in conformal ﬁeld theory, the
30 Details can be found in the monograph by Schutz (2003), Chap. 22.

138
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
structure of the fundamental Green’s function is mainly determined by the
conformal symmetry. Surprisingly enough, each string theory contains a par-
ticle of spin 2 which can be identiﬁed with the graviton. String theory is
the most promising candidate for a uniﬁed theory of all four interactions in
nature. However, one should also note that there is no experimental evidence
for strings so far. It is expected that typical string eﬀects can be only ob-
served at extremely high energies. Therefore, one is looking for indirect eﬀects
which can be observed at much lower energy ranges as virtual particles or
as a relic of the Big Bang (cosmic strings, magnetic monopoles, dark matter,
dark energy, and so on). As an introduction to string theory, we recommend
L¨ust and Theissen (1989) and Zwiebach (2004). Moreover, we refer to the
standard textbooks by Green, Schwarz and Witten (1987), Vols. 1, 2, and
Polchinski (1998), Vols. 1, 2. The history of string theory can be found in
Greene (1999).
Supersymmetry. Physicists assume that there exists a perfect symme-
try between fermions and bosons at extremely high energies. This means
that, for each fermion there exists precisely one boson called the supersym-
metric partner of the fermion. For example, the supersymmetric partners
of electrons, quarks, photons, and gravitons are called electrinos, quarkinos,
photinos, and gravitinos, respectively. Note that this so-called supersymme-
try is not observed in our real world today. Physicists assume that perfect
supersymmetry did exist only shortly after the Big Bang at extremely high
energies. However, physicists expect that the particle accelerators of the next
generation will be able to prove the existence of supersymmetric particles.
The relevant calculations have been already performed in the framework of
the so-called minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. For the renormaliza-
tion of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model see Hollik et al. (2002).
As an introduction to supersymmetry, we recommend Martin (1997) (a super-
symmetry primer), Bailin and Love (1997), Kalka (1997), and Kane (2000).
We also refer to Wess and Bagger (1991) and Weinberg (1995), Vol. 3.
The Higgs particles. In gauge theories, the messenger particles are
massless for mathematical reasons. In sharp contrast to this, the gauge bosons
W ± and Z0 possess a large mass of about 100 proton masses which corre-
sponds to a rest energy of 100GeV. In order to explain theoretically the par-
ticle masses of W ± and Z0, physicists invented a mathematical trick called
the Higgs mechanism, by using gauge invariance and adding appropriate mass
terms to the Lagrangian. In terms of physics, this means that the Standard
Model has to be supplemented by a number of hypothetical particles called
Higgs particles. Computations show that the mass of the lightest Higgs par-
ticle should be between 114 and 193 proton masses. In 2008, the energy of
the new CERN collider LHC31 will be large enough in order to establish the
31 The letters LHC stand for Large Hadron Collider. A detailed discussion of the
LHC can be found in the article by B. Mansouli´e, Physics at the large hadron
collider. In: Duplantier and Rivasseau (Eds.) (2003), pp. 311–331.

2.4 The Standard Model in Particle Physics

existence of Higgs particles on a sound experimental basis. Note that the
Standard Model of particle physics would break down if the Higgs particle
did not exist.
Noncommutative geometry and the Standard Model in particle
physics. It was discovered by Connes and Lott in 1990 that there is a new
kind of geometry behind the Standard Model of particle physics called non-
commutative geometry.32 As an introduction to noncommutative geometry,
we recommend the two monographs by Connes (1994) and Gracia-Bondia,
V`arilly, and Figueroa (2001).
Originally, the Higgs particle was inserted into the Standard Model by
hand. Noncommutative geometry implies the appearance of the Higgs particle
in a natural way. This will be studied in Volume V on the physics of the
Standard Model. Noncommutative geometry is a new branch of mathematics
which studies the generalization of geometric properties in terms of operator
algebras.
Quantum gravity. Most physicists assume that below the Planck length
lP = 10−35m and the Planck time tP = 10−44s, space and time lose their
classical geometric properties, and there appear new physical eﬀects com-
bining gravitation and quantum physics in a strange manner. This has been
coined as quantum gravity. Moreover, it is thinkable that space and time
did not exist at the very beginning of the universe. They were created later
on. In contrast to space and time, physical states always exist. They can be
described mathematically by operator algebras.
In the setting of noncommutative geometry, physical states are pri-
mary and space-time is secondary.
As an introduction to diﬀerent approaches to quantum gravity, we recom-
mend the collection of articles by Giulini, Kiefer, and L¨ammerzahl (2003)
(from theory to experimental search), the survey article by Ashtekhar and
Lewandowski (2004) (loop quantum gravity), and the monograph by Kiefer
(2004).
Most physicists expect that the creation of the ﬁnal theory of quantum
gravity will dramatically change our knowledge about space and time.
The main tasks of quantum ﬁeld theory. There exist two fundamen-
tal kinds of quantum states, namely, scattering states and bound states. In
terms of classical celestial mechanics, scattering states correspond to comets
and bound states correspond to closed orbits of planets (Fig. 2.15). Physicists
use quantum ﬁeld theory in order to compute
• the cross section of scattering processes,

2.5 Magic Formulas
Let us summarize the most important formulas which govern the world of
elementary particles.
(i) Planck’s quantization of the energy of the harmonic oscillator from 1900:
E = ℏω
	
n + 1
2

,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Here, we use the following notation: E energy of the harmonic oscillator,
ω angular frequency, h Planck’s quantum of action. Furthermore, the
symbol ℏ:= h/2π is called the reduced quantum of action. Forn = 0,
we get the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator, E0 = 1
2ℏω,
which was obtained by Heisenberg in 1925 in the framework of his new
quantum mechanics.
(ii) Planck’s mean energy of the harmonic oscillator from 1900:

1
eℏω/kT −1

along with the following notation: E mean energy, ω angular frequency,
T absolute temperature, k Boltzmann constant. For high temperatures,
kT ≫ℏω, we get approximately
E = kT.

2.5 Magic Formulas
141
According to Boltzmann, this is the mean energy of an oscillating degree
of freedom in a many-particle system at the suﬃciently high temperature
T. For low temperatures, kT ≪ℏω, we get
E = E0 + ℏωe−ℏω/kT
where E0 = 1
2ℏω is the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator.
In a hot universe of absolute temperature T , an elementary particle with
nonzero rest mass m0 can only exist if
T ≤Tcrit
where Tcrit := m0c2/k.
(iii) Einstein’s energy-mass relation for relativistic particles from 1905:
E2 = m2
0c4 + c2p2.
Here, we use the following notation: E energy of the particle, m0 rest
mass, p momentum vector, c velocity of light in vacuum. For a photon,
the rest mass vanishes, m0 = 0.
(iv) Einstein’s energy-frequency relation for photons from 1905:
E = ℏω.
Equivalently, E = hν. Here, we use the following notation: E energy of
the photon, ν frequency of the photon, ω = 2πν angular frequency.
(v) Bohr’s quantized energy of the hydrogen atom from 1913:
En = −mee4
8ε2
0h2 · 1
n2 ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Here, we use the following notation: En energy of the electron on the
nth orbit, −e electric charge of the electron, me mass of the electron, ε0
electric ﬁeld constant of the vacuum. The hydrogen atom consists of one
proton and one electron.
Equivalently, the Bohr energy can be written as
En = −

n = 1, 2, . . .
along with
r1 := λe
2πα,
λe :=

4πε0ℏc =

where r1, λe, α are called the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom, the
Compton wave length of the electron, and the ﬁne structure constant in
quantum electrodynamics, respectively.

(vi) The Schwarzschild radius of a star or a black hole from 1916:
r = GM
c2
where M denotes the mass of the star or the black hole, and G is Newton’s
gravitational constant.
(vii) De Broglie’s wave length of the matter wave corresponding to a relativis-
tic particle from 1924 (duality between particles and waves in quantum
physics):
λC =
h
m0c
along with the following notation: m0 rest mass of the particle, λC wave
length of the matter wave (Compton wave length). Note that the symbol
λC := λ/2π is called the reduced Compton wave length.
(viii) Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation for position and momentum from
1927:
∆q∆p ≥ℏ
2.
Here, ∆q and ∆p denote the mean error of the position coordinate q and
the momentum coordinate p of the quantum particle, respectively.
(ix) The energy-time uncertainty relation for unstable particles:
∆E∆t ≥ℏ
2
along with the following notation: ∆E mean energy and ∆t mean lifetime
of the particle.
(x) The golden Breit–Wigner lifetime rule from 1930: Consider the scattering
amplitude f = f(E) as an analytic function of the energy E. If this
function f has a pole at the complex energy value E = E0 + iΓ,
f(E) =
C
E −(E0 + iΓ) + regular terms,
then this corresponds to an unstable particle (resonance) of mean energy
E0 and mean lifetime,
∆tmean := ℏ
Γ .
The interval [E0 −1
2∆E, E0 + 1
2∆E] with ∆E := Γ contains the ﬂuctu-
ating energy values E of the particle. For the modulus of f, we have
|f(E)|2 =
|C|2
(E −E0)2 + Γ 2 + regular terms.

(xi) Yukawa’s meson mass formula from 1935:
m0 = ℏ
rc.
This equation relates the rest mass, m0, of the messenger particle (meson)
to the range, r, of the corresponding force (radius of the proton). The
typical length, r, is also called the reduced Compton wave length of the
messenger particle.
(xii) The Hawking temperature of a black hole from 1975:
T =

10kGM .
Here, T and M denote the temperature and the mass of the black hole,
respectively. Moreover, G denotes Newton’s gravitational constant.
(xiii) Hawking’s ﬁnite lifetime of a black hole caused by evaporation from
1975:
t = 5M 3G2
hc4
.
Here, t denotes the lifetime of the black hole.
(xiv) Friedman’s mean energy density of the early universe from 1922:
η =
3c2
32πt2 .
Here, η and t denote the energy density and the age of the universe,
respectively.
(xv) Hubble’s law for the red shift in the spectrum of distant galaxies from
1928:
∆λ
λ
= Ht.
Here, we use the following notation: H Hubble constant, λ wave length of
light, ∆λ red shift of wave length λ, t time needed by light for travelling
from the observed galaxy to earth. The red shift proves experimentally
the expansion of the universe. The Hubble law is only an approximation.
In fact, recent measurements of astronomers show that the expansion of
the universe is accelerated (see B¨orner (2003)).
2.6 Quantum Numbers of Elementary Particles
It is a typical feature of elementary particles that in contrast to classical
particles, important properties can be described by discrete numbers called
quantum numbers. The spin of an elementary particle serves as a typical
example.

2.6.1 The Spin
Orbital angular momentum, spin, and chirality of a planet. Let us
ﬁrst consider the spin in classical physics. Each planet of our solar system
travels around the sun in an elliptic orbit with position vector x = x(t) (Fig.
2.16). The vector
p(t) := m ˙x(t)
is called the momentum vector of the planet at time t, where m and the time
derivative ˙x(t) are the mass and the velocity vector of the planet, respectively.
The vector
a(t) := x(t) × p(t)
is called the orbital angular momentum vector of the planet at time t. The
length ||a|| of the vector a is called the orbital angular momentum of the
planet at time t. In the special case where the planet rotates counterclockwise
on a circle of radius r about the unit vector n with constant angular velocity
ω, the position vector x(t) of length r is orthogonal to the velocity vector
˙x(t) of length rω. Hence
a = (ωr2m)n.
In addition, the planet rotates counterclockwise about its own axis, given
by the unit vector ns, with constant angular velocity ωs. The corresponding
intrinsic angular momentum vector
S := χωs

r(P)2ϱ(P)dV

ns
is called the spin vector of the planet. Here, ϱ(P) is the mass density of the
planet at the point P, r(P) is the distance between the point P and the
rotation axis, and we take the volume integral over the points of the planet.
The length of the spin vector S is called the spin of the planet. The deﬁnition
of the spin vector S depends on the number χ = ±1 called chirality.
• If χ = 1, then the planet rotates counterclockwise about the vector S. The
planet is called right-handed (Fig. 2.17(a)).
• If χ = −1, then the planet rotates clockwise about the vector S. The planet
is called left-handed (Fig. 2.17(b)).

Fig. 2.18. Helicity ζ of a planet
For a planet, this is only a matter of convention. We agree to choose χ := 1.
Then the spin vector S points in the direction of the axis vector ns. The
situation changes completely in elementary particle physics. For an elemen-
tary particle, we can measure the spin vector S. The chirality χ = ±1 is
then an additional degree of freedom of an elementary particle which plays a
crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. Observe the following
peculiarity.
In the classical form of the Standard Model of particle physics, it is
assumed that neutrinos are massless and always left-handed.
However, this is only an approximation of reality. On the basis of recent
experiments, physicists assume that neutrinos possess a small mass and there
exist also right-handed neutrinos in nature. This is based on the following
experimental observation. In the burning sun, only electron neutrinos are
produced. The measurements of astrophysicists show that there appears a
shortage of sun neutrinos by a factor two. This neutrino defect problem in
the sun can be solved in the following way: If we assume that neutrinos have
a small mass, then this small neutrino mass makes it possible that neutrino
oscillations occur which convert the electron neutrino into other types of
neutrinos on its way from sun to earth; this changes the number of observed
neutrinos.33 As we will show later on, the Dirac equation allows us to deﬁne
the chirality of a fermion in an elegant way.
Helicity of a planet. The real number
ζ := S(t)p(t)
||p(t)|| = ||S(t)|| cos ϕ(t)
is called the helicity of a planet at time t, where ϕ(t) is the angle between
the spin vector S(t) and the direction of motion p(t) at time t (Fig. 2.18).
If ζ > 0 (resp. ζ < 0), then the spin vector S has the same (resp. opposite)
direction as the momentum vector p.
Fermions and bosons. Each elementary particle possesses an intrinsic
angular momentum called spin. The spin is characterized by a spin quantum
number

and Applications to Astrophysics, Springer, Berlin, 2003.

The particle is called a fermion iﬀj = 1
2, 3
2, 5
2, . . ., and the particle is called
a boson iﬀj = 0, 1, 2, . . . For example, the electron has the spin number
j = 1
2 (fermion), and the photon has the spin number j = 1 (boson). For the
quantity S2, we measure the mean value
ℏ2j(j + 1)
in each quantum state of the elementary particle. More precisely, we have the
following situation. Consider ﬁrst an electron which has spin quantum number
j =
1
2. Let the unit vector n be given. Choose a right-handed Cartesian
coordinate system such that the z-axis points in direction of n. Then there
exist two quantum states denoted by
| 1
2, n⟩
and
| −1
2, n⟩
such that we measure the spin vector
S = jzℏn
in the electron state
|jz, n⟩
where
jz = ± 1
2.
The number jz is called the spin projection number with respect to the unit
vector n.34 Consider now the general case where the elementary particle has
spin number j. Then there exist 2j+1 quantum states of the particle denoted
by |jz, j, n⟩where jz = j, j −1, j −2, . . . , −j. We measure the spin vector
S = jzℏn
in the particle state
|jz, j, n⟩.
It is possible that not all of these quantum states can be realized in nature.
In particular, for photons only the quantum states | ± 1, 1, n⟩are realized.
This corresponds to the classical fact that the polarization of electromagnetic
waves is always transversal. This means that both the electric and the mag-
netic ﬁeld are transversal to the direction of propagation of the wave. Since
the methods of statistical physics are based on the counting of quantum
states, the following holds true.
If certain quantum states are forbidden by a general principle, then
this has crucial consequences for the physical properties of quantum
systems.
For example, this concerns the Pauli exclusion principle below. The spin of
an elementary particle is related to the 3-dimensional rotation group SO(3).
This is only part of the truth. Since the group SO(3) is not simply connected,
it has a simply connected universal covering group given by the group SU(2)
which is also called Spin(3) (3-dimensional spin group).
34 Instead of jz, we also write j3.

2.6 Quantum Numbers of Elementary Particles
147
The spin of elementary particles results from the fact that the irre-
ducible representations of the group SU(2) can be characterized by a
number j which coincides with the spin quantum number.
Since the irreducible representations of the group SO(3) have integer spin
quantum numbers, j = 0, 1, . . ., one can say that
The existence of fermions is related to the nontrivial topological struc-
ture of the 3-dimensional rotation group.
For more details, we refer to Sect. 5.7.1.
The sum rule for spin quantum numbers. Consider two elementary
particles which have the spin numbers j1 and j2. Then the composite particle
has a spin number j which may attain precisely one of the following values:
j = j1 + j2, j1 + j2 −1, j1 + j2 −2, . . . , |j1 −j2|.
For example, a system of two protons with j1 = j2 = 1
2 may have the spin
number j = 1 or j = 0. A system of three protons may have the spin numbers
j = 1 ± 1
2 or j = 0 + 1
2, hence j =
3
2, 1
2. As we will show later on, this
sum rule can be based on the representations of the spin group SU(2) on
tensor products of linear spaces along with the decomposition into irreducible
representations.
Three general principles for elementary particles. The following
three principles play a fundamental role in quantum physics.
(i) The principle of indistinguishability. Quantum particles are not individ-
uals. They cannot be distinguished individually.
(ii) Pauli’s exclusion principle. In contrast to bosons, two fermions can never
be in the same quantum state of a given quantum system.
(iii) Pauli’s spin-statistics principle. Bosons (resp. fermions) obey Bose (resp.
Fermi) statistics.35
We will show later on that principle (i) is responsible for the fact that the
quantum states of bosons (resp. fermions) are symmetric (resp. antisymmet-
ric) under permutations of elementary particles. Many strange properties of
quantum systems are consequences of (ii) and (iii) (e.g., Bose–Einstein con-
densation – a group of bosons which are all in the same quantum state at
extremely low temperature, and which behave like a single entity36).
The color charge of quarks is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion
principle.
35 Bose (resp. Fermi) statistics is also called Bose–Einstein (resp. Fermi–Dirac)
statistics. These kinds of quantum statistical physics along with important ap-
plications can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV (e.g., Planck’s radiation law,
the critical Chandrasekhar mass of a white dwarf star (Nobel prize in physics in
1983), neutron stars, black holes, the death of a star, and the early universe).
36 For the experimental realization, Cornell, Ketterle, and Wiemann were awarded
the Nobel prize in physics in 2001.

148
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
In fact, we will show later on that quarks violate the Pauli exclusion principle
if we do not add additional degrees of freedom (called color). In the framework
of axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory created by G˚arding and Wightman in the
1960s, the spin-statistics principle is a rigorous mathematical theorem. This
can be found in Streater and Wightman (1968).
Historical remark. In 1922 Stern and Gerlach observed an unexpected
splitting of a ray of silver atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld (Stern–Gerlach eﬀect).
This splitting was explained by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck in 1925. They pos-
tulated that the electron has a spin, and hence a magnetic moment. More
precisely, if the electron is in the quantum state | ± 1
2, n⟩, then it has the
magnetic moment vector
m = −e
me
S,
S = ±ℏ
2n.
The vector m possesses the following physical meaning.
(i) An external magnetic ﬁeld B acts onto the electron by the force
F(x) = B′(x)m
(2.54)
and the torque T(x) = m × B(x).37
(ii) The constant magnetic ﬁeld B adds the energy E = −mB to the electron.
(iii) The electron induces a magnetic ﬁeld B0 given by
B0(x) =
µ0
4πr3
3(xm)x
r2
−m

where we set r := ||x||. Here, µ0 is the magnetic ﬁeld constant of a
vacuum.
The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld B is measured in Tesla, 1T = Vs/m2. The
magnetic ﬁeld of the earth has the strength of 0.5·10−4T. The force (2.54) is
responsible for the Stern–Gerlach eﬀect. Similarly, we expect that the proton
has the magnetic moment
m =
e
mp
S,
S = ±ℏ
2n
where e and mp denote the electric charge and mass of the proton, respec-
tively. The point is that these values are only approximations of the measured
values. Therefore, physicists say that both the electron and the proton have
an anomalous magnetic. For the magnetic moment µ := |m| of the electron
and the proton, experiments yield the values
µe =

B(x + εm) with respect to the real variable ε at the point ε = 0.

· 2.792 847 386 = 1.410 607 61(47) · 10−26J/T,
respectively. Thus, the magnetic moment of the electron is much stronger
than that of the proton. The relative error of the magnetic moment of the
electron and the proton is 3.4 · 10−7. The reason for these anomalous mag-
netic moments are typical eﬀects of quantum ﬁeld theory which are based
on vacuum ﬂuctuations (interactions with virtual electrons, virtual positrons
and virtual photons). The sophisticated renormalization methods of quantum
electrodynamics based on large computer programs yield a theoretical value
of the magnetic moment of the electron which is in fantastic coincidence with
the experiments. In 1949, Schwinger used his new theory of quantum elec-
trodynamics in order to compute the ﬁrst-order correction of the magnetic
moment of the electron. He obtained the formula
µe = eℏ

where α is the ﬁne structure constant. Precision experiments yield the value
α =

137.035 989 5(61).
Based on huge computer programs and the methods of perturbation theory
in quantum electrodynamics (Feynman diagrams and renormalization meth-
ods), physicists computed higher order corrections of the magnetic moment
of the electron which are in fantastic coincidence with experimental data.
The perturbation methods of quantum electrodynamics were invented
in the late 1940s by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga.
These methods along with Dyson’s renormalization approach allow the com-
putation of electromagnetic eﬀects in terms of powers of the ﬁne structure
constant α. Quantum electrodynamics investigates the interactions between
electrons, positrons, and photons. The extremely accurate coincidence be-
tween theory and experiment can still be improved by including physical
eﬀects that are caused by additional particles in the setting of the Standard
Model of particle physics. For example, the fourth-order approximation of
the magnetic moment of the electron also includes eﬀects which come from
the muon. For the ratio between the masses and the magnetic moments of
the muon and the electron, we get approximately
mµ

respectively. Similarly, for the ratio between the masses and magnetic mo-
ments of the neutron and proton, we obtain approximately

The exact values for the muon and the neutron are known with the same
high precision as for the electron and the proton. The magnetic moment
of the proton was measured by Stern in 1933 (Nobel prize in physics in
1943). Generally, both the experimental and the theoretical determination of
magnetic moments of elementary particles is a highly nontrivial task. The
magnetism of materials in nature is caused by both the intrinsic magnetic
moments of elementary particles (based on spin) and the motion of electrically
charged elementary particles.
In 1925 Heisenberg created quantum mechanics. Born and Jordan noticed
quickly that Heisenberg’s approach based on Fourier series could be reformu-
lated in the mathematical language of inﬁnite-dimensional matrices. There-
fore, Heisenberg’s quantum mechanics is also called matrix mechanics. In
1926 Schr¨odinger formulated an alternative approach to quantum mechanics
based on the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation for a wave function. In the
same year, Pauli generalized the Schr¨odinger equation to the non-relativistic
Pauli–Schr¨odinger equation by inserting the electron spin. Pauli noticed that
this approach, along with the exclusion principle, explains the structure of
atoms encoded in the periodic table of chemical elements.
The ﬁnal explanation for the existence of the electron spin was obtained
by Dirac in 1928. Dirac formulated a relativistic equation for the electron
by combining quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of special relativ-
ity (Nobel prize in physics together with Schr¨odinger in 1933). The Dirac
equation implies the existence of the electron spin, by using a simple group-
theoretical argument.
The electron spin represents a typical relativistic quantum eﬀect.
The same is true for the spin of all elementary particles. As we will see later
on, the Dirac equation is of fundamental importance for describing the 12
fundamental particles of the Standard Model of particle physics. From the
mathematical point of view, the Dirac equation is based on a Cliﬀord algebra.
Fundamentally, the spin of elementary particles is related to the transforma-
tion of quantum ﬁelds under the rotation of inertial systems. The general
approach was developed by Wigner in 1939 by classifying the irreducible
unitary representations of the Poincar´e group in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces (Nobel prize in physics in 1963).
The periodic table of chemical elements, Pauli’s exclusion prin-
ciple, and the shell structure of atoms. In 1869, great progress was made
in chemistry when Mendeleev (1834-1907) and Meyer (1830-1895) were able
to systematically order the chemical elements according to phenomenological
criteria. Table 2.5 shows the beginning of the periodic table. In the horizontal
direction the atomic number Z increases, while in the vertical direction ele-
ments behave similarly. In the late 1920s, Pauli discovered how the periodic

table of chemical elements can be understood in terms of quantum physics.
Let us discuss the main ideas.
(i) The atomic number Z is equal to the number of electrons and equal to
the number of protons in the nucleus.
(ii) The number of neutrons in the nucleus may vary for ﬁxed Z. Thereby
isotopes occur.
(iii) An electron state
|n, l, m, jz⟩
is characterized by the quantum numbers
• n = 1, 2, 3 . . . (orbit),
• l = 0, . . . , n −1 (orbital angular momentum),
• m = l, l −1, . . . , −l (orbital angular momentum projection),
• jz = ± 1
2 (spin projection).
In particular, the ground state is described by the quantum numbers
n = 1, l = m = 0, jz = ± 1
2. By Pauli’s exclusion principle, two electrons
cannot coincide in all four quantum numbers n, l, m, jz.
(iv) The energy of the electron depends on the quantum number n with
E1 < E2 < E3 < . . . For energetic reasons, the orbits with n = 1, 2, 3 . . .
are ﬁlled successively.
(v) The inner orbits are maximally ﬁlled. Such orbits are called closed shells
and denoted by K, L, M, . . . for n = 1, 2, 3 . . ., respectively. The electrons
of the incomplete outer orbit are responsible for the chemical behavior of
the element. The similarity of chemical elements is a consequence of the
same number of outer electrons. Table 2.5 shows the number of electrons
in diﬀerent orbits. In horizontal direction new electrons are added con-
tinuously. Here, the symbols s and p stand for electron states with the
quantum number l = 0 and l = 1, respectively. Furthermore, the symbol
nsk means that the number of s-electrons is equal to k in the nth orbit.
The maximal number of s-electrons in the nth orbit (n = 1, 2, 3 . . .) is
equal to 2 because of

2.
Similarly, the maximal number of p-electrons in the nth orbit is equal to
six since
n = 2, l = 1, m = 1, 0, −1, jz = ± 1
2.
In the vertical lines of Table 2.5 we have precisely the same number of
outer s- and p-electrons. This results in a similar behavior of the cor-
responding elements. The inert gases 2 He (helium), 10 Ne (neon), and
18 Ar (argon) have only closed shells K, L, M, respectively. This is the
reason for their chemical inactivity.
Spin-orbit coupling. The states from (iii) above neglect the interac-
tions between orbit and spin (called spin-orbit coupling) and the nonlinear
interaction between diﬀerent electrons. If we take the spin-orbit coupling
into account, then we cannot anymore distinguish between orbital angular
momentum and intrinsic spin of the electron. Only the total angular momen-
tum makes sense. By the sum rule for angular momenta, the electron states
|n, j, jz⟩are now described by the following quantum numbers:
• n = 1, 2, . . . (orbit),
• j = l + 1
2, l −1
2 (total angular momentum), l = 1, . . . , n −1,
• j = 1
2 if l = 0, and
• jz = j, j −1, . . . , −j (projection of total angular momentum).
The ground state corresponds to n = 1, j = 1
2, jz = ± 1
2. Starting with cal-
cium Z = 19, the irregularities of the ﬁlling of the orbits begin. This follows
from the fact that for a large number Z of electrons the interaction between
the electrons becomes stronger and the energetic situation becomes more
complicated.38
Symmetry breaking in atomic spectra. If an electron jumps from an
energy level En to a lower energy level Em, then a photon of energy
hν = En −Em
38 As an introduction to the application of group-theoretic methods to atomic spec-
tra, we recommend van der Waerden (1930) and Mizushima (1970).

2.6 Quantum Numbers of Elementary Particles

and frequency ν is emitted. In ﬁrst approximation, the electron energy En
only depends on the orbit quantum number n. This means that diﬀerent
electron states may have the same energy. This degeneracy of energy levels is
a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the electrostatic Coulomb force.
This symmetry can be broken by external magnetic (resp. electric) ﬁelds or by
internal forces between the electrons. As a rule, symmetry breaking reduces
the degeneracy of energy levels. In experiments, this leads to a splitting of
spectral lines. For example, in a constant magnetic ﬁeld, electron states with
diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers m possess diﬀerent energy levels. This
splitting of the spectrum is called the Zeeman eﬀect (in 1902 Zeeman was
awarded the Nobel prize in physics).
Quantum chemistry. Pauli’s approach to the periodic table of chem-
ical elements marked the emerging of quantum chemistry. Nowadays huge
computer programs (e.g., the “Gaussian” soft ware package) are used in or-
der to compute the properties of atoms and molecules. In 1998 Pople and
Kohn were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for the development of
computational methods in quantum chemistry and the development of the
density-functional theory, respectively. The density-functional method allows
us the approximate computation of ground state energies of large molecules.
• The ﬁrst task of quantum chemistry is to compute the energy levels of an
atom or molecule. This is done by the Ritz method for eigenvalue prob-
lems.39 The main point is to ﬁnd appropriate linear combinations of given
functions with unknown coeﬃcients for the computation of approximate
eigenfunctions.
• Furthermore, chemists want to get information on the geometry of the
molecules (distances and angles between atoms, symmetries).
• Finally, chemists want to compute the dynamics of a chemical reaction,
that is, the change of the structure of the molecules during a reaction
process (reaction path). In this connection, saddle points on the energy
surface of molecules are crucial. The points of the energy surface depend
on the geometric molecule parameters.
Heisenberg’s isospin. In 1932, motivated by the theory of the electron
spin and the fact that protons and neutrons have approximately the same rest
energy, Heisenberg regarded the proton p and the neutron n as two diﬀerent
states | 1
2⟩and | −1
2⟩of a quantum object (nucleon), and he called 1

the isospin number and the isospin projection of the nucleon, respectively.
The isospin and the so-called weak isospin play an important role in the
Standard Model.
The particle zoo. Beginning in the 1950’s, physicists used particle ac-
celerators of increasing power in order to discover a large zoo of unstable “el-
ementary particles” of extremely short lifetimes. These particles were called
resonances. The quite natural goal of physicists was to reduce this zoo to a
39 The Ritz method is thoroughly studied in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IIA.

154
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
small number of fundamental particles. They tried to understand the zoo of
elementary particles in the same way as the chemical elements can be under-
stood by means of the periodic table. To this end, physicists used quantum
numbers based on symmetries. Nowadays this goal is realized by the Standard
Model of elementary particle physics.
The mathematical formulation of the Standard Model in par-
ticle physics. In the next section, we will discuss the basic ideas of the
Standard Model in terms of quantum numbers. The detailed formulation of
the Standard Model in particle physics based on the full Lagrangian density
will be postponed to Volume III after a detailed study of quantum electro-
dynamics in Volume II. Quantum electrodynamics represents the Standard
Model in a nutshell. The Lagrangian density of the Standard Model contains
ﬁelds which describe
• the six quarks,
• the six leptons,
• the 12 messenger particles, and
• the Higgs particle.
The point is that the Lagrangian density of the Standard Model possesses
crucial symmetry properties, namely, the gauge symmetry
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3)
and the relativistic symmetry under Poincar´e transformations. Furthermore,
the Cliﬀord algebra of Dirac–Pauli matrices plays a crucial role. This Cliﬀord
algebra is closely related to the Minkowski metric of the 4-dimensional space-
time manifold. The interactions between elementary particles mediated by the
messenger particles are described by using the modern language of diﬀerential
geometry (curvature of ﬁber bundles) The prototype of this geometric concept
in physics will be discussed in Sect. 2.9.1 on page 183.
2.6.2 Conservation of Quantum Numbers
The Mendeleev of elementary particle physics is Murray Gell-Mann.
Folklore
The most important quantum numbers of elementary particles read as fol-
lows.

• j spin number (j3 third component of spin) (symmetry group SU(2) as
subgroup of the universal covering group SL(2, C) of the Poincar´e group
in special relativity),41
40 The group U(1) consists of all complex numbers z with |z| = 1.
41 The group SU(n) consists of all complex (n× n)-matrices A with A−1 = A† and
det A = 1.
The group SL(2, C) consists of all complex (2 × 2)-matrices A with det A = 1.

• Yw weak hypercharge (local gauge group U(1) of electroweak interaction).
Important examples can be found in Tables 2.6–2.9.
Antiparticles. If we pass from an elementary particle to its antiparticle,
then rest mass m0, spin j, strong isospin I, and weak isospin Iw remain
unchanged, whereas the quantum numbers
Q/e, B, L; Le, Lµ, Lτ; I3, I3
w, Y, Yw, S, B, C, T; χ, P
change their sign. The color charges r, g, b have to be replaced by anticolor
charges r, g, b, respectively. The values of the color charges change their sign.
Particles and antiparticles are described by mathematical objects
which are dual to each other (elements of a Hilbert space and of its
dual space).
42 I, I3, S, B, C, T, Y are based on the global symmetry group SU(6) of the six
quarks called the ﬂavor symmetry group of strong interaction.

Electric charge. The electric charge of an elementary particle is con-
served for all processes. For composed particles, the electric charge is an ad-
ditive quantity. Recall that baryons consist of three quarks, whereas mesons
consist of quark-antiquark pairs. The quantum number Q/e is an integer for
leptons, baryons, and mesons.
Lepton number. The lepton numbers are additive quantities. Using Ta-
ble 2.6 on page 155, we set
L := Le + Lµ + Lτ.
In particular, for leptons, L = 1. For quarks, baryons, and mesons, all of the
lepton numbers are deﬁned to be zero.
The lepton numbers L and Le, Lµ, Lτ are conserved for all processes.
For example, the beta decay of the neutron
n →p + e−+ νe

conserves the lepton numbers L and Le. In this case, the right-hand side has
the lepton number L = Le = 1−1 = 0, and the left-hand side has L = Le = 0
(see Table 2.6). Since the lepton number L of the electron neutrino, νe, is
equal to one, the process
n →p + e−+ νe
(2.56)
is impossible because it violates the conservation of L. In fact, in contrast to
(2.55), the right-hand (resp. left-hand) side of (2.56) has L = 0 + 1 + 1 (resp.
L = 0). This argument shows that the production of an electron must always
be accompanied by the production of an anti-electron neutrino. Similarly, the
process
n →p + µ−+ νe
is impossible because it violates the conservation of the electron lepton num-
ber Le. In fact, the right-hand (resp. left-hand) side has Le = 0 +0−1 (resp.
Le = 0).
Baryon number. The baryon number is an additive quantity. For each
quark, the baryon number is equal to 1
3. Since each baryon consists of three
quarks, the baryon number of baryons is equal to 1. For mesons and leptons,
the baryon number is equal to zero.

The baryon number B is conserved for all processes.
For example, one baryon can never decay into two leptons. Note that physi-
cists assume that the conservation of lepton number and baryon number was
violated shortly after the Big Bang. This way, the creation of leptons and
baryons was possible in the early universe. A similar asymmetry of the laws
of physics in the early universe is responsible for the dominance of particles
over antiparticles in the present universe.
Strong isospin, strangeness, and strong hypercharge. The relation
between electric charge Q and strong isospin I3 is given by
Q
e = I3 + Y
2
where the so-called strong hypercharge is deﬁned by Y := B +S +C +B +T.
The eight baryons (resp. eight mesons) pictured in Fig. 2.20 possess approx-
imately the same mass.43 They are distinguished by the “quantum number
hypercharge Y” and the “quantum number third component of isospin I3.”
The quark content can be found in Table 2.8 on page 156. For example, a
proton consists of two up quarks u and one down quark d. For the proton,
we get S = C = B = T = 0, and hence Y = 1. Moreover, the proton has the
isospin I = 1
2 and the third component of isospin I3 = 1
2. Thus, the electric
charge number of the proton is given by
Q
e = 1
2 + 1
2,
43 In contrast to strong hypercharge Y, weak hypercharge Yw is deﬁned by the
slightly modiﬁed relation
Q
e = I3
w + Yw
where Q and Iw denote electric charge and weak isospin, respectively. This con-
vention is used in order to simplify the notation in the Standard Model of particle
physics (see Table 2.9 on page 157).

2.6 Quantum Numbers of Elementary Particles

implying Q = e, as desired. For historical reasons, a baryon or meson is
called strange iﬀit contains a strange quark s or a strange antiquark s.
Such particles were discovered in the 1950s. All of the strange particles are
produced by strong interaction and often decay via weak interaction.
The quantum numbers I, I3, Y, S, C, B, T are conserved for processes
via strong interaction.
Chirality, weak isospin, and weak hypercharge. Table 2.9 on page
157 shows the classical Standard Model of electroweak interaction. This is
an approximation based on the assumption that neutrinos are massless and
there only exist left-handed neutrinos. Explicitly, the three left-handed pairs
are
(νe)L, e−
L;
(νµ)L, µ−
L;
(ντ)L, τ−
L .
Since these pairs possess speciﬁc transformation laws with respect to the
gauge group SU(2), they are called doublets. In addition, there exist right-

Here, d′
L replaces the quark d by a linear combination of quarks. The coeﬃ-
cients have to be determined by experiment. They are called CKM (Cabibbo–
Kobayashi–Maskawa) coeﬃcients. Moreover, we assign
• the weak isospin Iw = 0 (singlets), Iw = 1
2 (doublets), and
• the weak hypercharge Yw = 2Q/e (singlets), Yw = B −L (doublets).
The explicit values can be found in Table 2.9 on page 157.
Parity. To each lepton and quark, we assign the internal parity number
P = 1. For antileptons and antiquarks, P = −1. In addition, for the pho-
ton, P = −1. For composed particles, the internal parity is a multiplicative
quantity. Since mesons consist of quark-antiquark pairs, the internal parity
of mesons is equal to
P = 1(−1) = −1.
Baryons consist of three quarks. Thus, for baryons, P = 13 = 1. In addition,
let us introduce the orbital parity by letting
Porbital := (−1)l.
Here, l is the quantum number of angular momentum of the particle. Finally,
the total parity is deﬁned to be

Color of quarks. The electromagnetic interaction depends on the electric

The color charge is an additive quantity. We postulate that
The total color charge of baryons and mesons is equal to zero.
Since the superposition of red, green, and blue yields white, physicists also
say that baryons and mesons are white.
States of elementary particles and group theory. Mathematically,
states of elementary particles are described by unit vectors in complex Hilbert
spaces. The vectors depend on space and time. Let us consider the following
three examples. To simplify notation, we do not take the dependence on space
and time coordinates into account.
(i) Two electrons with spin. We are given a right-handed (x, y, z)-Cartesian
coordinate system. The symbol
|e−, j, j3⟩
denotes the state of an electron e−with spin numbers j = 1
2 and j3 = ± 1
2.
This means that, in this state, we measure the spin j3ℏin direction of
the z-axis. Assume that the two unit vectors

we measure the value

ψ2 represent the same physical state of the electron iﬀ
ψ1 = σψ2

value of the electron spin does not change. The antisymmetric tensor

the following two crucial facts.

the physical state. Thus, the two electrons are not distinguishable.
They lose their individuality (principle of indistinguishable elementary
particles).
• If j3

the same spin state (Pauli’s exclusion principle for fermions).
(ii) Two photons with spin. Electrons are fermions. In contrast to this, pho-
tons γ are bosons and hence Pauli’s exclusion principle is not valid for
photons. This motivates us to use the following symmetric tensor product

2.7 The Fundamental Role of Symmetry in Physics
Symmetries essentially simplify computations in mathematics and physics.

Symmetry, as wide or as narrow you may deﬁne its meaning, is one idea
by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order,
beauty, and perfection.

Symmetry45
Symmetry and invariance considerations have long played important roles
in physics. The 32 crystal classes – that is, groups of rotations in three-
dimensional space all the elements of which are of the order 2, 3, 4 or 6
– were determined 1830 by Hessel, in the same year as group theory was
born by Galois.

group which contain three non-coplanar translations) was a masterpiece of
analysis and so was the determination by Groth of the possible properties
of crystals with the symmetries of these space groups in 1926. . .
Symmetry transformations in pre-quantum theory were rather obvious
transformations of 3-dimensional space; in quantum theory they became
unitary transformations of Hilbert space. These form subgroups of all uni-
tary transformations which are essentially homomorphic to the symmetry
group in question, essentially homomorphic only because a unitary trans-
formation in quantum mechanics is equivalent to any of its multiples by
a numerical factor (of modulus 1). However, this essential homomorphy
could be reduced, particularly, as a result of Bargmann’s investigations in
most cases to a true homomorphy to an extended group which is called,
then, the quantum mechanical symmetry group.46 The quantum mechan-
ical operations of the symmetry group break up the Hilbert space of all
states into subspaces each of which is invariant under the operations in
question. . .
The unitary representations of the Poincar´e group were determined in the
late 30’s; except for the trivial one, they were all shown to be inﬁnite-
dimensional.47 This is equivalent with the statement that no system can
be relativistically invariant unless it can be in an inﬁnity of orthogonal
states. By calling attention to the properties of the unitary representations
of noncompact Lie groups, the physicists have stimulated the mathemati-
cians’ interest in this ﬁeld. The mathematicians are now very much ahead
of us in this ﬁeld, and it is not easy to catch up with the results of Gelfand,
Naimark, Harish-Chandra, and so many others.

Symmetry Principles in Old and New Physics
The most important lesson that we have learned in this century is that the
secret of nature is symmetry. Starting with relativity, proceeding through
the development of quantum mechanics, and culminating in the Standard
Model of particle physics, symmetry principles have assumed a central po-
sition in the fundamental theories of nature. Local gauge theories provide
the basis of the Standard Model and of Einstein’s theory of gravitation. . .
In recent years we have discovered a new and extremely powerful symmetry
– supersymmetry – which might explain many mysteries of the Standard
Model.
Another part of the lesson of symmetry is that much of the texture of the
world is due to mechanisms of symmetry breaking. In quantum mechanical
systems with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom global symmetries are
realized in only one way. The laws of physics are invariant and the ground
state of the theory is unique and symmetric. . . However, in systems with
an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom a second realization of symmetry
is possible, in which the ground state is asymmetric. This spontaneous

quantum physics.

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
symmetry breaking is responsible for magnetism, superconductivity, and
the structure of the uniﬁed electroweak theory in the Standard Model.
The second important lesson we have learned is the idea of renormalization
group and eﬀective dynamics. The decoupling of physical phenomena at
diﬀerent scales of energy is an essential characteristic of nature. It is this
feature of nature that makes it possible to understand the limited range
of physical phenomena without having to understand everything at once.
The characteristic behavior of the solutions of the renormalization equa-
tions is that they approach a ﬁnite dimensional submanifold in the inﬁ-
nite dimensional space of all theories. This deﬁnes an eﬀective low energy
theory. . . Thus, for example quantum chromodynamics is the theory of
quarks whose interactions are mediated by gluons. This is the appropriate
description at energies of billions of electron volts. However, if we want to
describe the properties of ordinary nuclei at energies of millions of elec-
tron volts, we employ instead an eﬀective theory of nucleons, composites of
the quarks, whose interactions are mediated by other quark composites –
mesons. . . There may be more than one, equally fundamental, formulation
of a particular quantum ﬁeld theory, each appropriate at a diﬀerent scale
of energy.
David Gross
The triumph and limitations of quantum ﬁeld theory.49
Symmetries have always played an important role in physics. With quan-
tum mechanics, however, the interplay between physics and symmetries
has reached a new dimension. The very structure of quantum mechanics
invites the application of group theoretical methods. . .
Symmetries are also a direct mediator between experimental facts and
the theoretical structure of a theory. This is the case because there is a
direct connection between symmetries and conservation laws. Space-time
symmetries are an obvious example. Conservation of energy, momentum
and angular momentum are linked to invariance under time translation,
space translation and rotation in space.
It was in atomic physics that space-time symmetries became signiﬁcant,
but they are also important in nuclear physics and in all the physics discov-
ered after that. In nuclear physics, however, a new concept of symmetries,
symmetries in an internal space, was discovered with isospin. All our so-
called fundamental models describing what we know about strong-weak
and electromagnetic interactions are built on symmetries in space-time
and internal spaces. These symmetries are not only used to extract in-
formation from a theory, they are also used to construct these theories,
and this for good reasons. It turned out that only theories possessing such
symmetries make sense as quantum ﬁeld theories. Thus symmetries are
not only a good tool to deal with quantum ﬁeld theoretical models, they
are necessary to deﬁne such models.
Following this line of thought, a new type symmetry, the so-called super-
symmetry, proved to be extremely successful. Quantum theory seems to
have a very deep relation to supersymmetry.50 Thus it is not surprising

that the most promising models of physics are based on supersymmetry,
even when they go beyond a local quantum ﬁeld theory, as string theory
does.51

For a deeper understanding of physical processes in nature, it is of funda-
mental importance to answer the following question.
Suppose that we observe a process in a physical system. Which trans-
formed versions of this process can also happen?
As we will show, this question is closely connected with the concept of sym-
metry which plays a fundamental role in modern physics. From the mathe-
matical point of view, symmetry is described by group theory which we will
encounter very frequently in this monograph. At this point, we only want
to discuss some basic ideas. First let us consider three important examples:
energy conservation, irreversible processes, and parity violation in weak in-
teraction.
(i) Time translation and energy conservation. Consider the motion q = q(t)
of a classical particle of mass m > 0 on the real line. The Newtonian
equation reads as
m¨q(t) = F(q(t)),
t ∈R.
(2.58)
Since the given smooth force F = F(q) only depends on position q, but
not on time t, the following hold true for each ﬁxed time t0:
If the smooth function q = q(t) is a solution of (2.58), then so is
the function q = q(t + t0).
We say that equation (2.58) is invariant under time translations. This
implies conservation of energy. To show this, choose a function U such
that F(q) = −U ′(q) for all q ∈R. Introduce the energy function
E(t) := m ˙q(t)2
2
+ U(q(t)).
For each solution q = q(t) of (2.58), we then get
E(t) = const
for all
t ∈R.
In fact, ˙E(t) = m¨q(t) ˙q(t) + U ′(q(t)) ˙q(t) = 0. Note that this argument
fails if the force F = F(q, t) depends on time t.

schaft on December 14, 1900. The Proceedings of the Symposia Quantum Theory

Vol. 9, 11/12 (2000) and Vol. 10, 1/2 (2001) (reprinted with permission). These
two volumes contain survey articles on the modern development of quantum
physics.

166
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
(ii) Irreversible processes. A process is called reversible iﬀit is invariant under
time-reversal. Otherwise, the process is called irreversible. In classical
mechanics, the motion of a mass point is reversible if the force is time-
independent. For example, if q = q(t) is a solution of (2.58), then so is
q = q(−t). The situation changes completely if there acts a friction force.
For example, consider the equation
m¨q(t) = −κ ˙q(t),
t ∈R
(2.59)
with the friction force F = −κ ˙q depending on velocity. Here, the real
number κ is positive. This problem has the solution
q(t) = e−κt/m,
t ∈R.
The motion is irreversible. To see this, observe that the time-reversed
process q = q(−t) = eκt/m is not a solution of (2.59). Since the equation
(2.59) is invariant under time translations, we expect energy conservation.
In fact, introducing the kinetic energy function
E(t) := m ˙q(t)2
2
along with the heat function Q(t) := κ
 t
0 ˙q(τ)2dτ, we get
E(t) −E(0) + Q(t) = const
for all
t ∈R.
This is the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, telling us that the loss of kinetic
energy E(t)−E(0) is compensated by the production of heat energy Q(t)
during the time interval [0, t]. In fact,
˙E(t) = m¨q(t) ˙q(t) = −κ ˙q(t)2 = −˙Q(t).
By friction, the real line is heated up. Let T (t) denote the temperature
of the real line at time t. Deﬁne the external entropy function Se by the
diﬀerential equation
˙Se(t) :=
˙Q(t)
T (t).
Explicitly,
Se(t) = Se(0) +
 t
0
κ ˙q(τ)2
T (τ) dτ
for all
t ∈R.
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that there exists a function
S = S(t) called total entropy such that
˙S(t) ≥
˙Q(t)
T (t)
for all
t ∈R.

Introducing the internal entropy Si by setting
S(t) = Se(t) + Si(t),
we get the inequality ˙Si(t) ≥0 or all times t ∈R. Diﬀerent choices of the
function Si lead to diﬀerent thermodynamic models. The model is called
reversible iﬀ
˙S(t) =
˙Q(t)
T (t)
for all
t ∈R.
This means that Si(t) = const for all t ∈R. For example, a simple
reversible model is obtained by setting κ = 0 along with Si(t) :≡0, and
S(t) = Se(t) := const
for all
t ∈R.
A detailed study of both phenomenological and statistical thermodynam-
ics can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV. We will show in Volume IV of
the present monograph concerning quantum mathematics that entropy is
equivalent to information. This explains why entropy plays such a crucial
role in nature.
The time-evolution of a living being is always irreversible. Indeed, one
never observes that an old man develops back in time into a baby. Since
past and future can be distinguished by observing living beings, physicists
say that time is directed, or, time is equipped with an arrow.
(iii) Parity violation in weak interaction. The Andromeda galaxy is 2 million
light years far away from the earth. Suppose that there exist intelligent
creatures on a star of the Andromeda galaxy. We want to tell them the
deﬁnition of right-handed orientation. On earth we only need the ﬁrst
three ﬁngers of our right hand. But how can we communicate this posi-
tive orientation to distant creatures which might not have a right hand?
The answer to this is an experiment that was performed by Mrs. Chien-
Shiung Wu and coworkers at Columbia University, New York in 1957.
The eﬀect is that the β-decay of 60
17Co-kernels results in the emission of
30 per cent more electrons antiparallel to the spin direction than parallel
(Fig. 2.21 on page 167). This shows that processes of weak interaction
are not always invariant under space reﬂections. Physicists call this the
violation of parity in weak interaction. Mrs. Wu starts her fundamental
paper (Phys. Rev. 105 (1957), 1431–1432) in the following way:

168
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
In a recent paper on the question of parity in weak interaction (Phys.
Rev. 104 (1956)), Lee and Yang critically surveyed the experimen-
tal information concerning this question and reached the conclusion
that there is no existing evidence either to support or to refuse par-
ity conservation in weak interactions. They proposed a number of
experiments on beta decays and hyperon and meson decays which
would provide the necessary evidence for parity conservation or non-
conservation. . .
In 1957 Chen Ning Yang and Tsung Dao Lee were awarded the Nobel
prize in physics for their theoretical contributions to parity laws in weak
interaction. Mrs. Wu was awarded the ﬁrst Wolf prize in physics in 1978.
Asymmetry under space reﬂections plays an important role in chemistry, too.
For example, amino acids existing on earth are left-handed.
2.7.1 Classical Symmetries
Consider the motion x = x(t), t ∈R, of a mass point in the 3-dimensional
Euclidean space. The following transformations play a fundamental role.
(i) Translation: x(t) + a.
(ii) Rotation: Rx(t).
(iii) Space reﬂection: −x(t).
(iv) Time translation: x(t + t0).
(v) Time reversal: x(−t).
(vi) Similarity transformation: λx(t).
(vii) Combined rescaling: λkx(λnt).
(viii) Rescaling of all physical units (choice of a new system of physical units).
(ix) Charge conjugation: Passage from a particle to its antiparticle. Replace
the charge Q by −Q.
If, in a physical system, the realization of the process x = x(t) implies that
the process x = x(t) + a is also possible, then we say that the physical
system is invariant under space translations. Similarly, we say that the system
is invariant under rotations, reﬂections, and so on. Such symmetries have
important consequences. For example,
Invariance under time translations, space translations, and rotations
imply conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum,
respectively.
This is a special case of the famous Noether theorem telling us that
Symmetries imply conservation laws.
This will be studied in Volume II.
Dimensional analysis. The very useful method (viii) above of dimen-
sional analysis in physics is based on the fact that physical quantities carry
a physical dimension. In this context, dimensionless physical quantities, like

prisingly enough,

• Kolmogorov’s law for turbulent ﬂow
can be obtained from general rescaling arguments without using the speciﬁcs
of the physical situation.

In contrast to this, the Maxwell equations are not invariant under Galileian
transformations, but under Lorentz transformations (2.37) on page 110. Ein-
stein postulated that one has to use Lorentz transformations instead of
Galileian transformations. This led him to his revolutionary theory of special
relativity in 1905 which did not change the Maxwell equations, but Newton’s
classical equation of motion.
Prediction of new elementary particles via symmetry. Important
symmetries appearing in modern physics are listed in Table 2.11 on page
169. The development of modern elementary particle physics has strongly
been inﬂuenced by the use of symmetries. The existence of new particles has
always been predicted in order to avoid lack of symmetry. For example, Gell-
Mann predicted the existence of quarks by using symmetry arguments based
on the representation theory of the Lie group SU(3).
Conformal ﬁeld theory. There holds the following rule of thumb:
The larger a symmetry group is, the stronger are its implications for
the structure of the physical system.
For example, in two dimensions, analytic functions generate conformal map-
pings. Therefore, the family of conformal mappings is huge in two dimensions.
Conformal ﬁeld theory studies physical systems that are invariant under con-
formal mappings (general rescaling). Typical examples are
• string theory,
• 2-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories, and
• 2-dimensional lattice models near phase transitions in statistical physics.
In these cases, conformal symmetry determines the Green’s functions in an
almost unique manner. Let us motivate why conformal symmetry might be
important for phase transitions. Typically, the physical system (e.g., the lat-
tice model) possesses a characteristic length scale given by the ﬁnite correla-
tion length. However, near a phase transition, the ﬂuctuations become large
and hence the correlation length becomes inﬁnite in the limit. In other words,
the system loses its ﬁnite characteristic length scale in a phase transition, and
it becomes invariant under rescaling (conformal transformations).
Observe that the Maxwell equations in electromagnetism do not distin-
guish a characteristic length scale. Therefore, we expect that the Maxwell
equations are invariant under 4-dimensional conformal transformations of
the Minkowski space. This is indeed true. We will study this in Volume III.

Here, we use the following notation: ϱ electric charge density, J electric cur-
rent density vector, ε0 electric ﬁeld constant of a vacuum, c velocity of light
in a vacuum, µ0 = 1/ε0c2 magnetic ﬁeld constant of a vacuum. The Maxwell
equations (2.60) are valid in each inertial system. If we pass from one inertial
system to another one, then we have to use the Lorentz transformation for
the space-time coordinates and the tensor transformation law for the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld tensor. The explicit transformation formulas for the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld will be considered in Volume III. Note that it may happen that
the electric ﬁeld is transformed into a magnetic ﬁeld and vice versa. Choosing
a right-handed Cartesian (x, y, z)-coordinate system with orthonormal basis
vectors i, j, k, we have
x = xi + yj + zk,
∂:= ∂
∂xi + ∂
∂y j + ∂
∂z k.
Let E = E1i + E2j + E3k. By classical vector calculus, recall that
grad U := ∂U = Uxi + Uyj + Uzk,
div E := ∂E = E1
x + E2

and
curl E := ∂× E = (E3

Let us introduce the following three operators C, P, T.
(i) Charge conjugation Q →−Q:
(Cϱ)(x, t) := −ϱ(x, t),
(CJ)(x, t) := −J(x, t),
(CE)(x, t) := −E(x, t),
(CB)(x, t) := −B(x, t).
(ii) Parity transformation x →−x:
(Pϱ)(x, t) := ϱ(−x, t),
(PJ)(x, t) := −J(−x, t),
(PE)(x, t) := −E(−x, t),
(PB)(x, t) := B(−x, t).
(iii) Time reversal t →−t:
(Tϱ)(x, t) := ϱ(x, −t),
(T J)(x, −t) := −J(x, −t),
(T E)(x, t) := E(x, −t),
(T B)(x, t) := −B(x, −t).

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
A simple computation shows that
The Maxwell equations (2.60) are invariant under the transforma-
tions C, P, and T .
For the transformation T , this means the following: If E, B, ϱ, J are solutions
of the Maxwell equations (2.60), then so are
T E, T B, Tϱ, T J.
The same is true, if we replace T by either C or P.
It was discovered by Maxwell that the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be rep-
resented in the form
E = −grad U −˙A,
B = curl A.
Here, U and A are called the scalar and the vector potential of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, respectively. As we will show on page 174, the potential
functions U and A are not uniquely determined by the electromagnetic ﬁeld
E, B. This is intimately related to the idea of gauge symmetry in elemen-
tary particle physics. In order to obtain crucial transformation laws for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, we introduce the operators C, P, T in the following way.
(i) Charge conjugation Q →−Q:
(CU)(x, t) := −U(x, t),
(CA)(x, t) := −A(x, t).
(ii) Parity transformation x →−x:
(PU)(x, t) := U(−x, t),
(PA)(x, t) := −A(−x, t).
(iii) Time reversal t →−t:
(TU)(x, t) := U(x, −t),
(T A)(x, t) := −A(x, −t).
Note that (cϱ, J) and (U/c, A) transform like (ct, x) under time reversal and
space reﬂections.53
The Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation. The equation for the wave func-
tion ψ = ψ(x, t) of a quantum particle of mass m and electric charge Q in an
electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B reads as
iℏ˙ψ = (P −QA)2
2m
ψ + QUψ
(2.61)
53 As we will show in Volume III, this remains true for arbitrary Lorentz transfor-
mations.

2.7 The Fundamental Role of Symmetry in Physics

along with the generalized momentum operator P = −iℏgrad and
E = −grad U −˙A,
B = curl A.
If we use the normalization condition

R3 |ψ(x, t)|2d3x = 1, then the integral

Ω
|ψ(x, t)|2d3x
tells us the probability for ﬁnding the particle in the region Ωof the Euclidean
space at time t. The operators C, P, and T for the wave function are deﬁned
as follows.
(i) Charge conjugation Q →−Q:
(Cψ)(x, t) := ψ(x, t).
(ii) Parity operation x →−x:
(Pψ)(x, t) := ψ(−x, t).
(iii) Time reversal t →−t:
(Tψ)(x, t) := ψ(x, −t)†.
Suppose that the potential U only depends on the modulus ||x|| of the posi-
tion vector x. By a simple computation, we obtain that
The Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation (2.61) is invariant under the
combined CPT transformation.
In addition, the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation is also invariant under gauge
symmetry. This will be considered in Sect. 2.7.3.
The basic symmetry of elementary particle processes. In contrast
to the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation, general processes for elementary par-
ticles are not always invariant under the single operations C, P, T. However,
the following holds true.
Elementary particle processes are invariant under the combined op-
eration CPT.
Intuitively, suppose that we observe a certain process for elementary particles.
Perform the following operations:
• reverse the time direction,
• replace particles by antiparticles and vice versa, and
• consider the process in a mirror.
This way, we get a new process which is also possible in nature.
In the 1950s, the fundamental CPT invariance principle was discovered by
Schwinger and L¨uders and perfected by Pauli. A rigorous proof was given by
Res Jost (1965) on the basis of the G˚arding–Whightman axiomatic quantum
ﬁeld theory introduced in the 1950s. Jost used sophisticated arguments based
on the analytic continuation of functions of several complex variables.54

Bogoliubov et al. (1990).

2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
2.7.3 Local Gauge Symmetry
Local gauge symmetry plays a crucial role in elementary particle physics. In
fact, the Standard Model of particle physics is based on local gauge symme-
try. At this point, let us only discuss the basic idea of gauge invariance by
considering the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation as a prototype.
The Maxwell equations. Let f = f(x, t) be a real-valued smooth func-
tion on R4. The transformation
U g := U −˙f,
Ag := A + grad f
is called a gauge transformation of the 4-potential U, A. Recall that the dot
denotes the time derivative. The point is that such a gauge transformation
leaves the electromagnetic ﬁeld invariant, that is,
Eg = E,
Bg = B.
This follows from
Eg = −grad U g −( ˙A)g = −grad U + grad ˙f −˙A −grad ˙f
= −grad U −˙A = E,
and Bg = curl Ag = curl A = B. In particular, the Maxwell equations
(2.60) are invariant under gauge transformations.
The Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation. Let α = α(x, t) be a smooth
real-valued function on R4. Consider the phase transformation
ψg(x, t) := eiα(x,t) ψ(x, t)
along with the transformation
U g := U −˙f,
Ag := A + grad f.
In addition, we assume that the phase function α is related to the transfor-
mation function f by
f(x, t) = ℏ
Q · α(x, t).
The transformation (ψ, U, A) →(ψg, U g, Ag) is called a gauge transformation
of the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation (2.61). Since the wave function ψ is
transformed by a phase factor eiα(x,t) which depends on space and time, the
gauge transformation is also called a local symmetry transformation.
Theorem 2.4 The Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation (2.61) is invariant under
gauge transformations.

2.7 The Fundamental Role of Symmetry in Physics
175
Explicitly, if ψ, U, A satisfy the equation (2.61) on page 172, then so do
ψg, U g, Ag. This tells us that the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation describes
the prototype of a gauge ﬁeld theory. In fact, we will show in Volume III that
the Standard Model of particle physics is of this type.
Proof. To simplify notation, choose the energetic system with ℏ= 1.
(I) Covariant derivative. In order to get insight, let us introduce the co-
variant derivatives
∇tψ := ∂ψ
∂t + iQUψ
(2.62)
and
∇ψ := grad ψ −iQAψ
(2.63)
which generalize the classical partial derivatives of the wave function ψ. For
the components in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems, we also write
∇jψ := ∂ψ
∂xj −iQAjψ,
j = 1, 2, 3
where A1, A2, A3 denote the components of the vector A. The point is that
In contrast to the classical partial derivatives, the covariant deriva-
tives transform like the wave function ψ under gauge transforma-
tions.
Explicitly, we will prove below that
(i) ∇g
t ψg = eiα∇tψ and
(ii) ∇gψg = eiα∇ψ.
Generally, transformation laws of this type are crucial for gauge ﬁeld theory,
as we will show in Volume III.
(II) Gauge invariance of the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation. Observe that
P −QA = −i(grad −iQA) = −i∇.
Therefore, using covariant derivatives, the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation
(2.61) on page 172 reads elegantly as
i∇tψ = −∇2ψ
2m .
By (i) and (ii), this implies
i∇g
t ψg = −(∇g)2ψg
2m
which is the desired invariance of the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation under
gauge transformations. In fact,

176
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
(∇g)2ψg = ∇g(∇gψg) = ∇g(eiα∇ψ) = eiα∇(∇ψ).
In addition, ∇g
t ψg = eiα∇tψ.
(III) Proof of (i). Observe that
∇g
t ψg = ∂
∂t(eiαψ) + iQU gψg
= (i ˙αψ + ˙ψ)eiα + iQUψeiα −i ˙αψeiα.
Hence ∇g
t ψg = eiα( ˙ψ + iQUψ) = eiα∇tψ.
(IV) Proof of (ii). By the product rule,
∇gψg = grad (eiαψ) −iQ
	
A + grad α
Q

eiαψ
= ψ grad eiα + eiα grad ψ −iQAeiαψ −ieiαψ grad α.
Since grad eiα = ieiα grad α, we get
∇gψg = eiα(grad ψ −iQAψ) = eiα∇ψ.

2.7.4 Permutations and Pauli’s Exclusion Principle
The states of an elementary particle system are invariant under permutations
of the particles (principle of indistinguishable particles). More precisely, we
use
• even permutations for bosons, and
• odd permutations for fermions.
This guarantees that, as in (2.57), two identical fermions can never stay to-
gether in the same state (Pauli’s exclusion principle). According to Hermann
Weyl, permutation groups also play a crucial role in order to determine the
irreducible representations of the Lie group SU(3) which are fundamental for
elementary particle physics.55
2.7.5 Crossing Symmetry
Suppose that a reaction of the form
A + B →C + D
55 This will be studied in Volume V on the physics of the Standard Model. See also
the classic monograph by Weyl (1938) on the representations of the classical Lie
groups.

2.7 The Fundamental Role of Symmetry in Physics
177
for elementary particles A, B, C, D is observed in an experiment. Replacing
the particle B by its antiparticle B and crossing it over to the other side of
the equation, we get
A →B + C + D.
Similarly,
A + C →B + D,
C + D →A + B.
The crossing symmetry principle tells us that all of these processes are possi-
ble if conservation of energy is not violated. The same is true for the reversed
process C + D →A + B.
2.7.6 Forbidden Spectral Lines in Molecules
The representation theory for groups is an extremely useful tool in order to
understand the structure of both molecule spectra and scattering processes
for elementary particles. The same concerns the structure of processes for
nuclei of molecules.
Folklore
Suppose that an electron of a molecule jumps from the nth orbit with energy
En to the mth orbit with lower energy Em. According to Heisenberg and
Schr¨odinger, the transition probability for this jump is equal to
γnm := e2ω3
nm
3πc3ℏ|⟨ψm|xψn⟩|2
with the dipol transition amplitude
⟨ψm|xψn⟩:=

R3 ψm(x, t)†xψn(x, t)d3x.
(2.64)
Here, e is the electric charge of the electron, and ωnm = (En −Em)/ℏis the
angular frequency of the emitted photon. Moreover,
ψn(x, t) = e−iEnt/ℏϕ(x)
is the Schr¨odinger wave function of the electron on the nth orbit. The jump
of the electron is impossible as dipole radiation iﬀ
⟨ψm|xψn⟩= 0.
(2.65)
For example, condition (2.65) is satisﬁed if ψn and ψm have the same par-
ity. In fact, in this case, ψn and ψm are both even (resp. odd) with respect
to x. Thus, the integrand from (2.64) is an odd function with respect to x,
and hence the integral vanishes. More generally, one can use the represen-
tation theory of the rotation group SO(3) in order to get (2.65) for special
values of angular momentum. In addition, the Wigner–Eckardt theorem tells

178
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
us the structure of the transition amplitude in terms of general values of an-
gular momentum. Similarly, symmetry properties of the S-matrix determine
the structure of transition probabilities for scattering processes of elementary
particles, including cross sections. This will be studied in later volumes. As an
introduction to the use of group theory in physics, we recommend the mono-
graphs by van der Waerden (1932), Novoshilov (1973), Fuchs and Schweigert
(1997).
2.8 Symmetry Breaking
Imperfection of matter sows the seed of death.
Thomas Mann (1875–1955)
Many phenomena in nature can be understood by using the fact that sym-
metries are disturbed under an external inﬂuence. We speak of symmetry
breaking which is frequently related to phase transition. As a typical process,
consider the cooling of water. At a critical temperature, water is transformed
into bizarre ﬂowers of ice by a phase transition. Obviously, the ice ﬂowers
possess a lower degree of symmetry than the homogeneous water. Mathemat-
ically, it is much easier to describe water than ice ﬂowers. Similarly, physicists
expect that shortly after the Big Bang, there existed only one fundamental
force. In the process of cooling the universe, the gravitational force, the strong
force, the weak force, and the electromagnetic force crystallized out step by
step.
2.8.1 Parity Violation and CP Violation
Recall that the violation of mirror symmetry (i.e., parity P) in weak interac-
tion was experimentally discovered by Mrs. Wu in 1955. After that discovery,
physicists hoped for some time that at least the combination of mirror sym-
metry and passage to antiparticles would be a universal symmetry in the
world of elementary particles (i.e., CP symmetry). For example, consider the
kaon decay
K0 →π+ + e−+ νe
(2.66)
caused by weak interaction. If CP symmetry would hold true, then the cor-
responding antiparticle reaction
K0 →π−+ e+ + νe
considered in a mirror would have the same decay rate as the original process
(2.66). But in 1964 it was established experimentally by Cronin and Fitch
that this is not true. In 1980, Cronin and Fitch were awarded the Noble prize
in physics for the discovery of CP violation in nature. However, note that
the eﬀect of CP violation is small.

2.8 Symmetry Breaking
179
2.8.2 Irreversibility
The time-evolution of living beings is not reversible. There arises the impor-
tant question whether processes for elementary particles are always reversible.
The answer is ‘no’. In fact, each process for elementary particles is invariant
under the combined CPT symmetry transformation. If time reversal T would
be a universal symmetry, then the CP symmetry would be universally real-
ized. However, this contradicts the CP violation observed in experiments.
2.8.3 Splitting of Spectral Lines in Molecules
Many eﬀects in quantum physics are based on the perturbation of degenerate
quantum states. For example, we speak of a degenerate energy E iﬀthere
exist n linearly independent states
|1⟩, |2⟩, . . . , |n⟩
in a Hilbert space which possess the same energy E. Under a small pertur-
bation, we obtain n slightly perturbed states
|1′⟩, |2′⟩, . . . , |n′⟩
with the n energies E′
1, E′
2, . . . , E′
n. This splitting of energy values leads to a
splitting of spectral lines which can be observed by physical experiment. As
a simple mathematical model, consider the eigenvalue problem
H(ε)|k⟩= Ek|k⟩,
k = 1, 2
with the matrices
H(ε) :=

1 + ε
0
0
1 −ε

,
|1⟩:=

1
0

,
|2⟩:=

0
1

.
For ε = 0, we get the degenerate eigenvalue E1 = E2 = 1, which splits into
the two eigenvalues E1 = 1 + ε and E2 = 1 −ε for ε ̸= 0.
The Zeeman eﬀect. For example, consider the electron of the hydrogen
atom on the nth orbit with angular momentum l. This electron can be in the
2l + 1 states
|l, m⟩,
m = l, l −1, . . . , −l
with energy En where l = 0, . . . , n −1, and n = 1, 2, . . .. The hydrogen atom
is invariant under rotations. If we put the hydrogen atom into a constant
magnetic ﬁeld B, then the full rotational symmetry is broken; it has to be
replaced by the rotational symmetry about the axis B. In 1926 Schr¨odinger
introduced his wave equation for the hydrogen atom, he computed the ener-
gies and wave functions for the hydrogen atom, and he developed stationary

perturbation theory.56 Using this, Schr¨odinger showed that, under the inﬂu-
ence of the magnetic ﬁeld B, the energy En of the unperturbed electron splits
into the 2l + 1 values
En + m∆E,
m = l, l −1, . . . , −l.
This energy splitting is observed in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom as
Zeeman eﬀect. For this experimental discovery, Pieter Zeeman was awarded
the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. The numbers l and m of the electron state
|l, m⟩are called angular quantum number and magnetic quantum number,
respectively.
The quark model. Similar group-theoretic arguments were used by
Gell-Mann in 1964. Organizing the mass spectrum of baryons and mesons
as pictured in Fig. 2.20 on page 158 and using the symmetry group SU(3),
Gell-Mann concluded that these particles (e.g., proton and neutron) are com-
posed particles. This led him to formulate the quark hypothesis which was
established experimentally a few years later by proton scattering experiments
at the Stanford linear accelerator SLAC.
2.8.4 Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Particles
If a physical process does not possess maximal symmetry, then we speak
of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, the gravitational ﬁeld of
the sun is invariant under rotations. Orbits of maximal symmetry are cir-
cles. In order to compute the orbit of the planet Mars on the basis of Tycho
Brahe’s experimental data, Kepler started with the ansatz of a circle. After
time-consuming computations,57 Kepler found out that the orbit of Mars is
an ellipse which was published in his Astronomia Nova from 1609. It was
discovered in the 1960s by Goldstone and Higgs that spontaneous symme-
try breaking of the ground state of a quantum ﬁeld enables us to model
mathematically the emergence of new particles called Goldstone and Higgs
particles. To explain the basic idea, consider the motion q = q(t) of a particle
of mass m in the complex plane
56 Perturbation theory for time-dependent processes was invented by Dirac in 1927.
As an introduction to perturbation theory, we recommend the classic monographs
by Kato (1966), Reed and Simon (1972), Vol. 4.
57 Note that Kepler could not use logarithms at this time, since logarithms were
introduced by John Napier only in 1614.

m¨q(t) = −U ′(|q(t)|),

(2.67)
under the inﬂuence of the Landau–Ginzburg potential
U(x) = (x2 −1)2,
x ∈R
as pictured in Fig. 2.22. Here, q(t) is a complex number.
(i) Symmetry of the vacuum. Observe that the potential U(|q|) is invariant
under the group U(1) of rotations
q →eiϕq
about the origin in the complex plane C. Here, the rotation angle ϕ is
a real number. The particle states q of lowest potential energy are given
by the equation
U(|q|) = 0,
q ∈C.
Hence |q| = 1, i.e., the set of ground states coincides with the unit circle.
This set is called the vacuum by physicists. Observe that the vacuum is
invariant under the rotation group U(1).
(ii) Spontaneous symmetry breaking. Fix some ground state, say, q0 = 1,
and set
q = q0 + h
where h is a small real quantity. In other words, we consider a pertur-
bation of the vacuum state q0. Since U ′(x) = 2x(x2 −1), the original
equation of motion (2.67) passes over to
m¨h = −2(1 + h)(2h + h2).
Setting κ0 := 4 and neglecting terms of order O(h2) as h →0, we get the
modiﬁed equation of motion
m¨h(t) + κ0h(t) = 0.
(2.68)
This describes the motion of a harmonic oscillator with the angular fre-
quency ω0 :=

κ0/m. Physicists say that problem (2.68) is obtained
from the original problem (2.67) by spontaneous symmetry breaking.
The Higgs particle. Note the crucial fact that the Standard Model of
particle physics represents a gauge ﬁeld theory. Such theories are generaliza-
tions of the Maxwell equations; they were considered ﬁrst by Yang and Mills
in 1954. Originally, the messenger particles of each gauge theory are mass-
less. However, if one introduces an additional massive particle called Higgs
particle, then it is possible to equip the massless messenger particle with a
mass. The procedure (ii) above represents an oversimpliﬁed version of the
so-called Higgs mechanism which will be studied in Volume III. This way, in

the Standard Model of particle physics, the messenger bosons W ±, Z0 obtain

ered experimentally at CERN in 1983 by a large group of experimentalists.
Rubbia and van der Meer were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1984
for their decisive contributions to this challenging project.
2.8.5 Bifurcation and Phase Transitions
Bifurcation is caused by a loss of stability; it is accompanied by an increase
of complexity, and hence a decrease of entropy.
Folklore
Bifurcation theory studies the change of the qualitative behavior of systems
under an external inﬂuence. For example, this is related to pattern formation.
As a typical example, consider a viscous ﬂuid between two parallel plates
heated from below. Let Tu and Tl denote the constant temperature of the
upper plate and the variable temperature of the lower plate, respectively. If
the temperature diﬀerence Tl −Tu reaches a critical value, then bifurcation
occurs. We observe the formation of hexagonal cells called B´enard cells ﬁrst
observed by B´enard in 1901. As a simple example, consider the diﬀerential
equation
˙q(t) = µq(t) −q(t)3,
t ∈R
for the motion of ﬂuid particles on the real line. The real parameter µ de-
scribes an external inﬂuence. The behavior of the trajectories is pictured in
Fig. 2.23.
• For µ < 0, the equation µq −q3 = 0 has the only solution q = 0. This
corresponds to an attractor at the point q = 0.
• For µ > 0, the equation µq −q3 = 0 has three solutions q = 0, q± := ±µ.
This corresponds to an repeller at the point q = 0 and two attractors at
the points q−and q+.
The bifurcation of this ﬂuid appears at the critical parameter value µ = 0.
There exists a rich arsenal of bifurcations for dynamical systems describing,
for example, ecological catastrophes in nature (e.g., the extinction of ani-
mals). Many results on bifurcation theory along with substantial applications
in the sciences can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vols. I–IV.

2.9 The Structure of Interactions in Nature

2.9 The Structure of Interactions in Nature
Force equals curvature in modern physics.
Folklore
2.9.1 The Electromagnetic Field as Generalized Curvature
Concerning the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation, it is a crucial observation that
the electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B can be obtained by the commutation relation
for covariant derivatives of the wave function ψ. Explicitly, with respect to a
right-handed Cartesian coordinate system,58 we have
∇t∇−∇∇t = iQE
(2.69)
and
∇1∇2 −∇2∇1 = −iQB3.
(2.70)
Using cyclic permutation, we also get
∇2∇3 −∇3∇2 = −iQB1,
∇3∇1 −∇1∇3 = −iQB2.
In modern diﬀerential geometry, curvature is deﬁned by the commutation
relations for covariant derivatives. According to (2.69) and (2.70), the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld E, B can be regarded as the curvature to the covariant
derivatives generated by the Schr¨odinger–Maxwell equation. In order to prove
(2.69) and (2.70), observe that
∇t = ∂
∂t + iQU,
∇= grad −iQA,
by (2.62) on page 175. Hence
∇t∇= ∂
∂t grad −iQAt
and
∇∇t = grad ∂
∂t + iQ grad U.
Since grad commutes with
∂
∂t, we get
∇t∇−∇∇t = −iQAt −iQ grad U = iQE.
This is (2.69). Similarly, it follows from
∇k = ∂k −iQAk,
k = 1, 2, 3
58 Recall that x = x1i + x2j + x3k, and ∂k := ∂/∂xk. Similarly, the components of
B are denoted by B1, B2, B3, and so on.

184
2. Phenomenology of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles
that
∇j∇k = ∂j∂k −iQ∂jAk.
Since ∂j∂k = ∂k∂j,
∇1∇2 −∇2∇1 = −iQ(∂1A2 −∂2A1) = −iQB3.
This proves (2.70).
2.9.2 Physics and Modern Diﬀerential Geometry
In modern diﬀerential geometry, one starts with the notion of parallel trans-
port, which corresponds to the transport of information in physics. Parallel
transport allows us the construction of covariant derivatives.59 Finally, com-
mutation relations between covariant derivatives lead us to the crucial notion
of curvature. This will be studied in Volume III by using the modern language
of ﬁber bundles, which ﬁts best the idea of parallel transport of mathematical
objects. This approach called gauge ﬁeld theory applies to
• the curvature of curves,
• the classical Gaussian curvature of 2-dimensional surfaces,
• the Riemann curvature of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds,
• Einstein’s theory of general relativity and the Standard Model of modern
cosmology,
• the Cartan–Ehresmann curvature of ﬁber bundles,
• the Maxwell theory of electromagnetism with respect to the gauge group
U(1),
• the Yang–Mills gauge ﬁeld theory with respect to the gauge group SU(n)

• string theory.
Historical remarks. In the 20th century, physicists discovered step by
step that the fundamental interactions in nature can be described mathe-
matically by so-called gauge ﬁeld theories. At this point let us only mention
the following. For example, in nature we observe electrons as basic particles.
Mathematically, electrons are governed by the 1928 Dirac equation which
combines Einstein’s 1905 theory of special relativity with Schr¨odinger’s 1926
quantum mechanics. Dirac noticed immediately that his equation predicts
the existence of an antiparticle to the electron which has the positive electric
charge e. In 1932 Anderson discovered the positron experimentally in cosmic
rays. Now to the point of gauge ﬁeld theory.
59 Parallel transport and covariant derivatives are closely related to the notion of
‘connection’ which is basic for modern diﬀerential geometry.

2.9 The Structure of Interactions in Nature
185
If we postulate that the Dirac equation is invariant under local sym-
metries (i.e., suitable phase transformations), then we have to intro-
duce mathematically an additional ﬁeld.
It turns out that this additional ﬁeld corresponds to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. According to Einstein, the electromagnetic ﬁeld consists of light quanta
(photons). Roughly speaking, we can say that
The existence of the electron implies the existence of its antiparticle
and of the photon which mediates the interaction between electrons
and positrons.
The same remains true for the other interactions described by the Standard
Model of particle physics. The existence of the 12 basic particles (quarks and
leptons) of the Standard Model implies the existence of their antiparticles
and of the 12 interacting particles (8 gluons, the photon, and the three vec-
tor bosons W +, W −, Z0.) The number of the interacting particles is closely
related to the fact that the gauge group U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3) of the Standard
Model of particle physics has 1 + 3 + 8 = 12 dimensions.
In his 1915 theory of general relativity, Einstein described Newton’s grav-
itational force by the curvature of the 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian
space-time manifold. ´Elie Cartan discovered in the 1920’s that one can assign
the notion of curvature to fairly general mathematical objects. This general-
izes Gauss’ famous theorema egregium. In the 1950s, Ehresmann formulated
the ﬁnal abstract mathematical theory of the curvature of ﬁber bundles. Yang
and Mills discovered in 1954 that it is possible to generalize Maxwell’s the-
ory of electromagnetism to more general noncommutative symmetry groups.
Nowadays we know that the curvature of ﬁber bundles is behind
• Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
• Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism,
• quantum electrodynamics,
• the Standard Model of particle physics as a generalization of quantum
electrodynamics,
• string theory,
• supergravity theory, and so on.
In the terminology of physicists, all of these theories are gauge theories.
Mnemonically,
force = curvature.
This is the most important principle of modern physics. Since ancient times,
physicists have made strong eﬀorts to understand the forces in nature. Math-
ematicians studied geometric objects and wanted to understand their cur-
vature. It turns out that physicists and mathematicians studied in fact the
same problem. This beautiful interaction between mathematics and physics
will be thoroughly studied in Volume II on quantum electrodynamics and in
Volume III on gauge theory.

3. The Challenge of Diﬀerent Scales in Nature
Between quantum length scales (atomic diameters of about 10−10m) and
the earth’s diameter (106m) there are about 16 length scales. Most of tech-
nology and much of science occurs in this range. Between the Planck length
(10−35m) and the diameter of the visible universe there are 70 length scales;
70, 16, or even 2 is a very large number. Most theories become intractable
when they require coupling between even two adjacent length scales. Com-
putational resources are generally not suﬃcient to resolve multiple length
scales in three-dimensional problems and even in many two-dimensional
problems. The problem is not merely one of presently available compu-
tational resources, which are growing at a rapid rate. To obtain an extra
factor of 10 in computational resolution requires in the most favorable
case a factor 104 in computational resources for time-dependent three-
dimensional problems. When multiple length scales are in question, the
under-resolution of computations performed with today’s algorithms will
be with us for some time to come, and the essential role which must be as-
signed to theory, and to the design of algorithms of a new nature, becomes
evident. It is for this reason that nonlinear and stochastic phenomena, of-
ten described by the theory of coherent and chaotic structures, coupling
adjacent and multiple length scales, is a vital topic.1

3.1 The Trouble with Scale Changes
In physics we frequently have to perform singular limits when passing from
one essential scale to another one. There are the following typical examples:
(i) the singular limit from Einstein’s theory of general relativity to Newtonian
mechanics,
(ii) the singular limit from the mesoscopic Boltzmann equation to the macro-
scopic Navier–Stokes equations in continuum mechanics,
(iii) phase transitions as a singular limit related to the Ginzburg–Landau
equation,
(iv) thin ﬁlms as singular limits,
(v) thin plates as singular limits of 3-dimensional elasticity theory,

In what follows, let us discuss some basic ideas.
Ad (i). Letting the velocity of light go to inﬁnity, c →∞, the wave
equation
Utt
c2 −Uxx −Uyy −Uzz = 0
passes over to the Laplace equation
−Uxx −Uyy −Uzz = 0.
Roughly speaking, this is the limit from Einstein’s theory of relativity to New-
tonian mechanics. The causal structure of the theory of relativity is described
by the light cone
x2 + y2 + z2
c2
−t2 = 0.
This cone degenerates into the plane t = 0 as c →∞. This is represented
schematically in Fig. 3.1. In terms of mathematics, this limit was studied ﬁrst
by Friedrichs (1927).
Note that this limit is highly nontrivial, since the type of the partial
diﬀerential equation changes completely from the hyperbolic wave equation
to the elliptic Laplace equation. Important recent results were obtained by
Rendall (1994).
Ad (ii). In 1913 Hilbert investigated the Boltzmann equation. He posed
the problem of justifying the limit from the Boltzmann equation for a vis-
cous ﬂuid to the Navier–Stokes equations in continuum mechanics. This cor-
responds to a passage
• from the mesoscopic length scale l = 10−5cm (the free path length of a
molecule)
• to the macroscopic length scale l = 1cm.
This famous, highly nontrivial problem was ﬁnally solved by Golse and Saint-
Raymond (2001).
Ad (iii). Phase transitions in superconductivity and superﬂuidity can be
modelled mathematically by the stationary Ginzburg–Landau equation. To
this end, one studies the singular limit ε →0 for the following variational
problem

where the boundary function g is given. This was done by Bethuel, Br´ezis,
and H´elein (1994) in a sophisticated manner. We refer to this monograph.
The basic ideas can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 2, p. 152.
Ad (iv). Thin ﬁlms play an important role in modern high technology.
From the mathematical point of view, the main task is to start with the
equations of continuum mechanics and to rigorously study the limit d →0,
that is, the thickness goes to zero (Fig. 3.2). Recent sophisticated results can
be found in DeSimone, Kohn, M¨uller, and Otto (2002).
Ad (v). To study the limit d →0 for thin plates of thickness d, it is possi-
ble to apply de Giorgi’s powerful technique of Γ-convergence for variational
integrals. For this, we refer to Friesecke, James, and M¨uller (2002). A brief
introduction to Γ-convergence can be found in Jost and Li-Jost (1998).
Ad (vi). The mathematical theory of microstructures tries to understand
the mathematical mechanisms which are responsible for the formation of mi-
crostructures. In this connection, singular scaling limits play a fundamental
role. As an introduction to this quite interesting, modern ﬁeld of mathemati-
cal analysis, we recommend the lecture notes by M¨uller (1998) and Dolzmann
(2003).
Summarizing, the transition from one essential scale to another one is a
highly nontrivial task for mathematics. The dream of physicists is to create
a ﬁnal theory for the four fundamental forces in the universe. However, the
experience of mathematicians in the past tells us that it will be extremely
diﬃcult to pass from the Planck length l = 10−33cm to the macroscopic scale
l = 1 cm, in a mathematically rigorous way.
3.2 Wilson’s Renormalization Group Theory in Physics
Each Lagrangian density represents a physical theory. The idea of ﬂows for
ordinary diﬀerential equations can be generalized to ﬂows (or semi-ﬂows) in
the space of physical theories. It turns out that appropriate ﬁxed points of
the semi-ﬂow correspond to phase transitions. The physical idea behind this
ﬁxed point is the observation that

3. The Challenge of Diﬀerent Scales in Nature
Physical systems are invariant under rescaling at phase transitions.
Intuitively, this is based on the following fact: Since the correlation length
becomes inﬁnite at a phase transition (large ﬂuctuations), the system loses its
typical length scale. We will study this in great detail in the later volumes. In
the collection of seminal papers that appeared in the journal Physical Review,
Joel Lebowitz writes the following:2
The Wilson renormalization group in statistical physics had antecedents in
quantum ﬁeld theory by Gell-Mann and Low.3 Following Wilson’s work,
the renormalization group method has spread and had enormous inﬂu-
ence on almost all ﬁelds of science. It provides a method for quantitative
analysis of the “essential” features of a large class of nonlinear phenom-
ena exhibiting self-similar structures. This includes not only scale invariant
critical systems (phase transitions) where ﬂuctuations are “inﬁnite” on the
microscopic spatial and temporal scale, but also fractals, dynamical sys-
tems exhibiting Feigenbaum period doubling, Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser
theory (KAM theory) on critical resonances in celestial mechanics, singu-
lar behavior in nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations, and “chaos”. Even
where not directly applicable, the renormalization group often provides a
paradigm for the analysis of complex phenomenas. . . A lot of mathemati-
cal work remains to be done to make it into a well-deﬁned theory of phase
transitions.
For his theory of critical phenomena in terms of the renormalization group,
Kenneth Wilson (born 1935) was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1982.
Wilson’s ideas changed the paradigm of theoretical physics.
(i) In the past, physicists studied speciﬁc theories like the motion of planets
around the sun or the motion of the electron around the nucleus of the
hydrogen atom.
(ii) Nowadays physicists want to study the behavior of physical phenomena
at quite diﬀerent scales. The idea of the renormalization group helps to
bridge the diﬀerent scales.
As a typical example for (ii), consider the cooling of the universe after the Big
Bang. To understand this, we have to study the behavior of elementary par-
ticles at completely diﬀerent energy scales. Let us mention two fundamental
phase transitions in the early universe:
• First phase transition: Using the method of running coupling constants
in renormalized quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists discovered that, 10−35
seconds after the Big Bang at a temperature of 1028K, strong interaction

and electroweak interaction decoupled. This phase transition corresponds
to a particle energy of 1015 GeV.
• Second phase transition: 10−12 seconds after the Big Bang at a tempera-
ture of 1016K, weak and electromagnetic interaction decoupled. This cor-
responds to a particle energy of 103 GeV.
Note that the most powerful particle accelerator in the world will begin to
work at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) in the year 2008. There, the particle
energy will be about 103 GeV. This means that we will be able in near future
to reach the energy scale of the second phase transition in a huge laboratory
on earth.
If we want to create a uniﬁed theory for all fundamental interactions in
the universe including gravitation, then we have to bridge 60 scales,
• from the radius of the visible universe, r = 1028cm,
• down to the Planck length, l = 10−33cm (see Table 3.1).
3.2.1 A New Paradigm in Physics
To emphasize the role of Wilson’s new paradigm in physics, let us quote from
the introduction to a series of lectures on the renormalization group given by
David Gross:4
Physics is scale dependent. For example, consider a ﬂuid. At each scale of
distances, we need a diﬀerent theory to describe its behavior:
• at ∼1 cm – classical continuum mechanics (Navier–Stokes equations),
• at ∼10−5cm – theory of granular structure,
• at 10−8 cm – theory of atom (nucleus plus electronic cloud),
• at 10−13cm – nuclear physics (nucleons),
• at ∼10−13cm – 10−18cm – quantum chromodynamics (quarks)
• at ∼10−33cm – string theory.
At each scale, we have diﬀerent degrees of freedom and diﬀerent dynamics.
Physics at a larger scale (largely) decouples from the physics at a smaller
scale. For example, to describe the behavior of a ﬂuid at the scale ∼1cm,
we do not need to know about the granular structure, nor about atoms
or nucleons. The only things we need to know are the viscosity and the
density of the ﬂuid. Of course, these values can be computed from the
physics of a smaller scale, but if we found them out in some way (for
example, measurement), we can do without smaller scale theories at all.
Similarly, if we want to describe atoms, we do not need to know anything
about the nucleus except its mass and electric charge.
Thus, a theory at a larger scale remembers only ﬁnitely many parameters
from the theories at smaller scales, and throws the rest of the details away.

Study in Princeton, New Jersey, devoted to the physics and mathematics of
quantum ﬁeld theories. See P. Deligne, E. Witten et al., Lectures on Quantum
Field Theory, Vol. 1, pp. 551–593, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, Rhode Island

More precisely, when we pass from a smaller scale to a larger scale, we
average over irrelevant degrees of freedom. Mathematically, this means
that they become integration variables and thus disappear in the answer.
This decoupling is the reason why we are able to do physics. If there was
no decoupling, it would be necessary for Newton to know string theory to
describe the motion of a viscous ﬂuid. . .
The general aim of the renormalization group method is to explain how
this decoupling takes place and why exactly information is transmitted
from scale to scale through ﬁnitely many parameters. In quantum theory,
decoupling of scales is not at all obvious. Indeed, because of the uncertainty
principle, we have to work at all scales at once. The renormalization group
describes why decoupling survives in quantum theory.

My text for today is a paper by Francis Low and Murray Gell-Mann.5 It is
“Quantum Electrodynamics at Small Distances” published in the Physical
Review in 1954. This paper is one of the most important ever published
in quantum ﬁeld theory. . . Gell-Mann and Low started by considering an
ancient problem, the Coulomb force between two charges and how this
force behaves at very short distances. . . The important thing about the
Gell-Mann–Low paper was the fact that they realized that quantum ﬁeld

theory has a scale invariance, that the scale invariance is broken by particle
masses but these are negligible at very high energy or very short distances
if you renormalize in an appropriate way, and that then the only things
that’s breaking scale invariance is the renormalization procedure, and that
one can take that into account by keeping track of the running coupling
constant a(r).
Steven Weinberg, 1983
It is typical for the coupling constants of the Standard Model of particle
physics that they depend on the physical situation, for example, the energy-
momentum transfer of a scattered particle. We speak of running coupling
constants. This has been established experimentally. In 1994, the Particle
Data Group reported that, for scattering processes of particles at an energy of
91 GeV,6 one does not have to use the classical electromagnetic ﬁne structure
constant α = 1/137.04, but rather the eﬀective ﬁne structure constant
a =
1
128.87 ± 0.12.
To begin with, we want to study the running coupling constant (i.e., the
running ﬁne structure constant) in the case of quantum electrodynamics. We
will work in the energetic system, that is, we set c = ℏ= ε0 := 1.
The renormalized electric charge. The classical electrostatic Coulomb
ﬁeld of an electron with electric charge −e and mass me is given by
E = −grad U
along with the Coulomb potential

(3.1)
where r := ||x||. Recall that the electric charge −e is related to the electro-
magnetic ﬁne structure constant α by

137.04.
We will also use the reduced Compton wave length 7 λe = 1/me. The force
F between two electrons is equal to
F = −grad V
with V = −eU. Hence
V (x) = α

6 This is the rest energy of the Z0 boson.

In 1935 Sperber and Uehling showed that quantum eﬀects change the electric
ﬁeld E = −grad U of a charged particle. For an electron, we have to replace

We call a(r) the running ﬁne structure constant, since it depends on the
distance, r. The eﬀective electron charge −e(r) is deﬁned by
e(r)2 := 4πa(r).
In quantum electrodynamics, the coupling constant between the Dirac ﬁeld
of the electron and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by κ = e. Therefore, we
call
8 In terms of modern quantum electrodynamics, the potential U is obtained by
using renormalized second-order perturbation theory. This will be studied in
Volume II. See also Landau and Lifshitz (1982), Vol. IV, Sect. 111, and Greiner,

the running coupling constant of quantum electrodynamics. In contrast to
the classical Coulomb law (3.1), the modiﬁed Coulomb law (3.2) contains
the distinguished length scale λe. This is an important consequence of the
renormalization procedure.
The basic ideas of the renormalization group in quantum elec-
trodynamics. In 1954 Gell-Mann and Low studied the Coulomb potential
for short distances in all orders of perturbation theory. They found out that
the approach can be substantially simpliﬁed by using general symmetry ar-
guments which correspond to the renormalization group. Let us discuss the
basic ideas by using some heuristic arguments. Choose the distance R > 0 as
a ﬁxed, suﬃciently small parameter. Suppose that the coupling constant a(R)
is known at the given distance R. It is our goal to determine the coupling
constant a(r) for distances r diﬀerent from the initial distance R. Below we
will obtain the following approximative formula
a(r) =
a(R)
1 −2a(R)

ln
 R

(3.4)
for all distances r > rcrit(R). Naturally enough, the critical distance rcrit(R)
is given by the zero of the denominator, that is,
1 −2a(R)
3π
ln
	
R
rcrit(R)

= 0.
In particular, it follows from (3.3) that a(R) = α, up to terms of order O(α2).
Hence
rcrit(R) = 10−293m.
This critical distance is extremely small. Finally, we obtain the crucial limit
lim
r→rcrit+0 a(r) = +∞.
Summarizing, we get the following in quantum electrodynamics.
There exists a tiny critical distance rcrit such that the eﬀective electric
charge of two electrons at distance r > rcrit becomes inﬁnite if the
distance r goes to rcrit.
We will not get any information about the behavior for distances r < rcrit.
The situation changes dramatically if we replace electrons by quarks. The
strong force between two quarks vanishes if the distance between two quarks
goes to zero. This will be discussed in Sect. 3.2.3 on page 201.
In order to get the crucial relation (3.4), we will use the elegant technique
of the renormalization group. The essential ingredients of this technique read
as follows:

• dimensional analysis,
• the algebraic renormalization-group equation (self-similarity),
• the equivalent renormalization-group diﬀerential equation (also called the
inﬁnitesimal renormalization-group equation), and
• the solution of the renormalization-group diﬀerential equation.
We will also show that the renormalization group represents a local 1-dimen-
sional group (also called local ﬂow), in the sense of the classical theory due
to Sophus Lie (1842–1899).
Dimensional analysis and the renormalization-group equation.
The quantities a(r), r/R, and r/λe = rme are dimensionless in the energetic
system. By dimensional analysis, we start with the ansatz
a(r) = G

a(R), r
R, rme

for the running coupling constant a(r). We now make the crucial assumption
that, for small distances r, the function G does not depend on the electron
mass me. Thus, we get the key equation
a(r) = G

a(R), r
R

.
(3.5)
We call this the renormalization-group equation. This equation tells us that
the running coupling constant a(r) at the distance r depends on both the run-
ning coupling constant a(R) at the distance R and the ratio r/R. Generally,
in physics, such a situation is characterized by the key word self-similarity.
The classical Lie theory can be used in order to analyze the general structure
of the solutions of equation (3.5). The idea is to pass over from (3.5) to an
equivalent diﬀerential equation which is called the renormalization-group dif-
ferential equation (or the inﬁnitesimal renormalization-group equation). As a
preparation for this, let us write G = G(a, x), and let us introduce the crucial
Gell–Mann–Low beta function
β(a) := −Gx(a, 1).
It follows from (3.5) that a = G(a, 1). By Taylor expansion,
G(a, x) = G(a, 1) + Gx(a, 1)(x −1) + o(x −1)
= a −β(a)(x −1) + o(x −1),
x →1.
Roughly speaking, the beta function a →β(a) knows all about the local
behavior of the function G.
The renormalization-group diﬀerential equation. Using the re-
placement R ⇒r and r ⇒r + ∆r, it follows from (3.5) that

function. To this end, we will use the additional information given by equation
(3.3) which follows from renormalized perturbation theory. By (3.3), we get
a(r) = α,
and
a′(r) = −2α2
3πr ,
up to terms of order O(α3). This motivates the diﬀerential equation
a′(r) = −2a(r)2
3πr .
(3.7)
This is the desired renormalization-group diﬀerential equation (3.6) with the
beta function β(a) := 2a2/3π. Summarizing,
• the general structure of the renormalization-group diﬀerential equation
(3.6) follows from dimensional analysis (Lie group theory);
• the speciﬁc form of this equation depends on the beta function which fol-
lows from renormalized perturbation theory.
The same method can be applied to the Standard Model of particle physics.
Rescaling. To simplify the approach, it is convenient to rescale the dis-
tance r by introducing the new variable
t := ln
 r


,
r > 0.
(3.8)
Setting b(t) := a(r), the diﬀerential equation (3.7) passes over to the rescaled
renormalization-group diﬀerential equation:
b′(t) = −2b(t)2
3π
(3.9)
along with the initial condition b(0) = a(R). This equation has the unique
solution
b(t) =
a(R)
1 +

3π a(R)t
for all t > −3π/2a(R), which proves the claim (3.4).

3.2 Wilson’s Renormalization Group Theory in Physics
199
Summarizing, the renormalization group approach adds a global as-
pect to local renormalized perturbation theory (3.3).
This is one of the crucial advantages of renormalization group theory. It
remains to show that there is indeed a symmetry and hence a group behind
(3.5). To this end, we will use the classical Lie theory for diﬀerential equations.
The relation to Lie’s theory of additive one-parameter groups.
The renormalization-group diﬀerential equation (3.9) can be written as
b′(t) = −β(b(t)),
along with the initial condition b(0) = a(R). Since the beta function does not
explicitly depend on time t, this diﬀerential equation describes a dynamical
system. Let b = b(t) be a solution. In terms of physics, we regard this as the
trajectory of a ﬂuid particle on the real line. Deﬁne
Ftb(0) := b(t).
The ﬂow operator Ft sends the initial position b(0) of the ﬂuid particle at time
t = 0 to the position b(t) of the particle at time t. Obviously, F0b(0) = b(0),
and
Fs(Ftb(0)) = Fsb(t) = b(t + s) = Ft+sb(0).
This implies that
(i) F0 = id, and
(ii) FtFs = Ft+s for all real numbers t, s in some open neighborhood of
t0 = 0.
Following Sophus Lie, we call the family {Ft} of operators Ft a local additive
one-parameter group (or a local ﬂow).
The multiplicative one-parameter group. Let us now reformulate
this in terms of the original parameter r. Consider the renormalization-group
diﬀerential equation
a′(r) = −β(a(r))
r
.
(3.10)
Let a = a(r) be a solution. Deﬁne
Gra(1) := a(r).
With respect to the variable t = ln r, the function a(r) := Fln r a0 is a solution
of (3.10) with a(1) = a0. Hence
Gra(1) = Fln r a(1).
This implies that

(i) G1 = id, and
(ii) GrGR = GrR for all real numbers r and R in some open neighborhood of
r0 = 1.
Deﬁne G(a, r) := Gra. We want to show that
G

= a(r).
This is the renormalization-group equation. In fact, GRG1/R = id implies
G1/R = G−1
R . Therefore,
Gr/R a(R) = GrG1/R a(R) = GrG−1
R a(R) = Gr a(1) = a(r).
The family {Gr} is called a local multiplicative one-parameter group.
Historical remarks. The idea of the renormalization group in quantum
electrodynamics can be traced back to a paper by St¨uckelberg, Petermann
(1953), and by Gell-Mann, Low (1954). Based on Lie’s theory of inﬁnitesimal
transformations and the Dyson transformation in renormalization theory, the
mathematical theory of the renormalization group in quantum ﬁeld theory
was developed by Bogoliubov and Shirkov (1956). Nine years later, Kadanoﬀ
(1965) applied the idea of renormalization group to studying the Ising model
for ferromagnets near the phase transition. As a powerful general tool for
modern physics, the theory of renormalization group was established by Wil-
son around 1970 (see Wilson and Kogut (1974)). For this, he was awarded
the Nobel prize in physics in 1982. In particular, Wilson used the idea of
renormalization group in order to compute
• critical exponents for the physical laws which govern phase transitions of
many-particle systems (e.g., ﬂuids, gases, materials), and
• the high-energy asymptotics of quantum ﬁelds via the method of the sin-
gularities of operator products on the light cone, and
• the structure functions for the cross sections of scattering processes via the
operator-product method.
In the 1980s, Polchinski (1984) developed a new approach to the renor-
malization of quantum ﬁeld theories by using a semi-ﬂow which approaches
the renormalized Lagrangian in a large number of steps. This revolutionized
renormalization theory in both quantum ﬁeld theory and statistical physics.
This can be found in the monograph by M. Salmhofer (1999). For a detailed
history of the renormalization group, we refer to L. Brown, Renormalization:
From Lorentz to Landau and Beyond, Springer, New York, 1993. See also
Rivasseau’s remark on the modern strategy in renormalization theory quoted
on page 849. This strategy has been strongly inﬂuenced by Wilson’s work on
the renormalization group. For recent progress in the theory of the renormal-
ization group due to Connes, Kreimer, and Marcolli, we refer to Sect. 15.4.6
on page 859.

3.2.3 The Running Coupling Constant and the Asymptotic
Freedom of Quarks
In 1973 Politzer, Gross, and Wilczek realized that the plus sign in the
logarithmic term (3.2) which prevented the use of perturbation theory in
quantum electrodynamics at short distances, for non-Abelian gauge the-
ories is a minus sign10. . . Politzer, Gross, and Wilczek instantly realized
that this explains an experimental fact which had been observed in a fa-
mous experiment on deep inelastic electron-proton scattering done by an
MIT-SLAC collaboration in 1968. This was that at very high momentum
transfer, in other words, at very short distances, the strong interactions
seem to turn oﬀand the formulas for the form factors in deep inelastic elec-
tron scattering seem to obey a kind of naive scaling,“Bjorken scaling”.11
Steven Weinberg
We say that some interaction between particles is asymptotically free iﬀthe
particles move freely for short distances (or high energies). In terms of the
running coupling constant κ(r), by asymptotic freedom we understand that
the function r →κ(r) is continuous on a reasonably large interval ]0, r0[, and
lim
r→+0 κ(r) = 0.
This means that the interaction vanishes for short distances. Typically, quarks
are free particles at short distances.
Lack of asymptotic freedom in quantum electrodynamics. By
(3.4),
a(r) =
a(R)
1 −2a(R)
3π
ln( R
r )
(3.11)
for all distances r > rcrit(R). The running coupling constant a = a(r) is
deﬁned on the interval ]rcrit(R), ∞[, and
lim
r→rcrit+0 a(r) = +∞.
Note that rcrit = 10−293m. This is an extremely small distance compared
with the radius of the proton, r = 10−15m. At the critical distance rcrit, the
electromagnetic interaction becomes inﬁnite, i.e., quantum electrodynamics
breaks down. Observe that physicists expect that already below the Planck
length, r = 10−35m, quantum ﬁeld theory breaks down. For such short dis-
tances, physicists believe that the structure of space and time change dramat-
ically, and quantum ﬁeld theory has to be replaced by quantum gravitation.
Nowadays, there exist several proposals for quantum gravitation. However,
10 See Politzer (1973), Gross and Wilzek (1973). The three physicists were awarded
the Nobel prize in physics in 2004.

a convincing and generally accepted theory of quantum gravitation is still
missing.

with the solution
a(r) =

Choose now the converse sign, σ := −1. Then, the situation changes com-
pletely compared with quantum electrodynamics. We now have a(r) > 0 for
all r ∈]0, R[, and
lim
r→+0 a(r) = 0.
This is a model for asymptotic freedom which resembles the situation in
strong interaction to be considered below.
Running coupling constants in gauge theories. The method de-
scribed above for quantum electrodynamics can be generalized to gauge ﬁeld
theories with the gauge groups U(1) and SU(n) where n = 2, 3, ..., along with
the coupling constant κ. Let us introduce the energy-momentum 4-vector
P := (E, p)
with the Minkowski square P 2 = E2−p2.Recall that we work in the energetic
system with c = ℏ= ε0 = 1. The coupling constant
κ(P)
depends on the energy-momentum 4-vector P of the physical experiment
under consideration. We speak of running coupling constant. Let us also
introduce the running ﬁne structure constant of the theory by letting
α(P) := κ(P)2
4π
.
In the special case of quantum electrodynamics, we have κ(P) = e(P), where
−e(P) is the running eﬀective electron charge which depends on P. Comput-
ing the renormalized radiative corrections in lowest order, one obtains the
following renormalization group diﬀerential equation

(3.14)
For ﬁxing the energy-momentum scale P0, the value α(P0) of the ﬁne struc-
ture constant has to be determined by the experiment. As typical examples,
let us consider both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynam-
ics.
(i) Quantum electrodynamics (electromagnetic interaction): In this case, we
have the gauge group U(1) and one fermion, namely, the electron. Hence

Let us pass from energy-momentum to distance r. High energies P 2 cor-
respond to small distances r. Therefore, it is reasonable to replace the
dimensionless quantity P 2/P 2

Writing a(r) instead of α(r) and choosing γ = 4, this is precisely formula
(3.11) which has been motivated in the preceding section.
(ii) Quantum chromodynamics (strong interaction): Here, we have six quarks
along with the gauge group SU(3). Hence βQCD = β3 = 11 −4 = 7. This

3. The Challenge of Diﬀerent Scales in Nature
Observe that the renormalization-group diﬀerential equation above is only
an approximation. If we pass to higher-order perturbation theory, then this
diﬀerential equation has to be reﬁned which leads to corrections of the basic
formula (3.14). Higher-order corrections can be found in the monograph by
B¨ohm, Denner, and Jost (2001), Sect. 2.6.
High-energy asymptotic freedom in strong interaction. For strong
interaction, equation (3.15) tells us that
lim
P 2→+∞αQCD(P) = 0.
This is the famous asymptotic freedom of strong interaction discovered in
1973 by Politzer, Gross, and Wilczek. From the physical point of view, this
means that quarks are free particles at very high energies or very small dis-
tances (e.g., in the early universe or inside the proton).
3.2.4 The Quark Conﬁnement
In 1964 Gell-Mann introduced quarks as a mathematical construction for
simplifying the classiﬁcation of elementary particles. But he hesitated to
consider them as real particles, since the experiments in particle accelera-
tor did not prove the existence of such particles. The situation changed in
1967 when electron-proton scattering experiments at SLAC (Stanford Uni-
versity) revealed an internal structure of the proton. Nowadays, we assume
that there exists a quark conﬁnement, which prevents quarks from living
outside of hadrons in our present world. A deep theoretical understanding
of quark conﬁnement is a true challenge for modern theoretical physics. In
1974 Wilson initiated a discrete version of the Standard Model called lattice
gauge ﬁeld theory. On the basis of this lattice approach, special supercom-
puters have been constructed which are able to compute, for example, the
proton mass as a bound state of three quarks.
In addition, there exist phenomenological models for explaining quark
conﬁnement. For example, bag models are based on the construction of ef-
fective potentials which do not allow the quarks to leave the bag. Other so-
called chromoelectric models use similar methods as in superconductivity by
replacing magnetic ﬁelds with electric ﬁelds. In this direction, a fundamental
approach was developed by Seiberg and Witten (1994). This led to the for-
mulation of the famous Seiberg–Witten equation which plays a fundamental
role in modern diﬀerential geometry and topology.12
12 As an introduction to the Seiberg–Witten equation, we recommend Moore (1996)
and Jost (2000a). See also the survey article by Donaldson (1996). The Seiberg–
Witten equation simpliﬁes dramatically the sophisticated Donaldson theory for
constructing topological invariants of 4-dimensional manifolds via the Yang–Mills
equation.

3.2.5 Proton Decay and Supersymmetric Grand Uniﬁcation
There may be all sorts of new physical eﬀects that come into play at particle
energies above 1015 GeV. For example, there’s no real reason to believe that
baryon number would be conserved at such energies. . . We might expect
a proton mean lifetime of the order of magnitude of (1015GeV)4/(α2m5
p),
essentially as estimated in a paper by Georgi, Quinn, and me (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 33, 451). This comes out to be about 1032 years.
Steven Weinberg13
Figure 3.3 shows the running coupling constants αQED, αEW , αQCD of quan-
tum electrodynamics, electroweak interaction and strong interaction (quan-
tum chromodynamics), respectively. Surprisingly enough, the curves of the
three coupling constants intersect each other at a typical particle energy of
1015 GeV. Therefore, physicists conjecture that above this critical particle
energy, there exists only one fundamental interaction which can be described
by a theory called Grand Uniﬁed Theory (GUT). In the framework of GUT,
the proton is not stable anymore. Experiments show that the mean lifetime
of a proton is more than 1032 years. This disqualiﬁes the original GUT based
on the gauge group SU(5). However, supersymmetric variants of GUT are
still possible, since they possess additional degrees of freedom. Interestingly
enough, the intersection of the running coupling constant curves in Fig. 3.3
is especially sharply concentrated at one point in the case of supersymmetric
GUT. This seems to underline the importance of superymmetric theories.
3.2.6 The Adler–Bell–Jackiw Anomaly
In 1969 Adler, Bell, and Jackiw pointed out that there exist special Feynman
diagrams in the theory of electroweak interaction which cause nasty divergent
expressions called Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomalies. Fortunately enough, these
anomalies disappear if one postulates the following lepton–quark symmetry:
The number of leptons is equal to the number of quarks.
This condition is fulﬁlled in the Standard Model of particle physics. Here, we
have six leptons and six quarks. For the theory of anomalies, we refer to the
monograph by Fujikawa and Suzuki (2004).

3.3 Stable and Unstable Manifolds
The method of Wilson’s renormalization group reduces the computation of
critical phenomena in physics to the study of dynamical systems near a sta-
tionary point. To explain the basic ideas concerning stability and instability,
let us consider discrete dynamical systems.
Iterative methods, stable manifolds, and unstable manifolds. For
given real parameters a and x0, the iterative method
xn+1 = axn,
n = 0, 1, . . .
is convergent (resp. divergent) for |a| < 1 (resp. |a| > 1). In the case of
convergence, we have
lim
n→∞xn = 0.
The limit x = 0 is the unique solution of the ﬁxed point equation
x = ax
if a ̸= 0. We say that this ﬁxed point is attracting (resp. repelling) if |a| < 1
(resp. |a| > 1) (Fig. 3.4). In terms of physics, we set x(n∆t) := xn. This can
be regarded as the position of a particle at the discrete time n∆t.
Let us now study the more general 2-dimensional iterative method
xn+1 = 1
2xn,
yn+1 = −2yn,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(3.16)
The corresponding equation
x = 1
2x,
y = −2y
has the unique ﬁxed point (x, y) = (0, 0). The behavior of the iterative
method (3.16) critically depends on the choice of the starting point.
• For the starting point (x0, 0), the iterative method (3.16) converges to the
ﬁxed point (0, 0) along the x-axis which is called a stable manifold.
• In contrast to this, for the starting point (0, y0) with y0 ̸= 0, the itera-
tive method (3.16) runs away along the y-axis which is called an unstable
manifold.

Fig. 3.5 shows the ﬂow of a ﬂuid which is a continuous version of the itera-
tive method (3.16). As an introduction to the theory of stable and unstable
manifolds for dynamical systems, we recommend the monograph by Amann
(1990).
In statistical mechanics, it turns out that the renormalization-group
ﬂow (or semi-ﬂow) corresponds to iterative methods which possess
a ﬁxed point along with the typical property that there exist stable
and unstable manifolds which are passing through the ﬁxed point. In
terms of physics, the ﬁxed point describes a phase transition.
We refer to the collection of survey articles by Duplantier and Rivasseau
(2003).
3.4 A Glance at Conformal Field Theories
In terms of mathematics, rescaling of a physical parameter corresponds to
a special conformal transformation. Therefore, it is quite natural that the
theory of conformal transformations plays an important role in statistical
mechanics in connection with phase transitions and in 2-dimensional quantum
ﬁeld theory. The point is that the conformal invariance in two dimensions
determines almost uniquely the structure of the Green’s functions (correlation
functions). Conformal ﬁeld theory was founded by Polyakov in 1970.14 For the
last 30 years, physicists have developed the so-called conformal ﬁeld theory.
We refer to Fuchs (1992) (introduction), Fradkin and Palchik (1996), De
Francesco et al. (1997) (general theory), and Polchinski (1998), Vols. 1, 2
(string theory).
For example, the conformal symmetry plays a fundamental role in string
theory, since string theories are conformally invariant. From the mathematical
point of view, the theory of conformal transformations was created by Gauss
in the 1820s and further developed by Riemann in the 1850s. The notion of
Riemann surfaces and their uniformization by Poincar´e and Koebe in 1907
is the mathematical background of conformal ﬁeld theory and string theory.
This will be studied in Volume VI.

4. Analyticity
Mathematicians and physicists like holomorphic and meromorphic func-
tions, since the local behavior of such functions determines completely
their global behavior.
Folklore
A complex number has the form
z = x + yi
where x and y are real numbers and i2 = −1. We write ℜ(z) := x and ℑ(z) := y and
call this the real and imaginary part of z, respectively. The set of all complex num-
bers is denoted by C; it is also called the complex plane. Using polar coordinates,
each complex number z = x + yi can be written uniquely as
x = r cos ϕ,
y = r sin ϕ,
−π < ϕ ≤π
where r :=
p
x2 + y2. The real numbers
|z| := r,
arg z := ϕ
are called the modulus and the principal argument of z, respectively (Fig. 4.1).
Using the Euler formula eiϕ = cos ϕ + i sin ϕ, each complex number z can also be
uniquely represented as
z = |z| · eiϕ,
−π < ϕ ≤π.
Sometimes it is useful to use the representation
z = |z|eiϕ∗
where ϕ∗= arg(z) + 2πk with k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . We call ϕ∗an argument of the
complex number, and we write arg∗(z) = ϕ+.
Convention. In what follows, the symbol U always denotes an open subset of
the complex plane.
The theory of complex-valued holomorphic functions is one of the most beau-
tiful parts of mathematics; it has played a key role in the development of modern
mathematics (analysis, topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory). As an in-
troduction to complex function theory, we recommend Hurwitz and Courant (1964)
(classic), Remmert (1991), (1998), and Zeidler (2004).

4.1 Power Series Expansion
Holomorphic functions. A function f : U →C is called holomorphic on the open
set U iﬀit is diﬀerentiable at each point z of U, that is, there exists the derivative
f ′(z) = lim
h→0

Theorem 4.1 A function f : U →C is holomorphic on the open set U iﬀ, for
each point z0 ∈U, there exists a power series such that
f(z) = a0 + a1(z −z0) + a2(z −z0)2 + . . .
for all points z in some open neighborhood of z0.
For example, polynomials are holomorphic. The power series expansion
ez :=

is convergent for all z ∈C. Thus, the exponential function z →ez is holomorphic
on the complex plane. The same is true for the functions z →sin z, cos z given by
sin z := eiz −e−iz
2i
,
cos z := eiz + e−iz
2
for all
z ∈C.
For all z, w ∈C, there holds the crucial addition theorem
ez+w = ezew.
The exponential function has the period 2πi. For all z ∈C, we have the Euler
relation
eiz = cos z + i sin z.
Entire functions. By deﬁnition, a function f : C →C is called entire iﬀit
is holomorphic on the complex plane. For example, polynomials, the exponential
function z →ez, and the trigonometric functions z →sin z and z →cos z are entire
functions.
Locally holomorphic functions. Let z0 be a point of the complex plane. A
complex-valued function f is called locally holomorphic at the point z0 iﬀthere
exists an open ball B(z0) centered at z0 such that the function f : B(z0) →C is
holomorphic.

4.1 Power Series Expansion

Biholomorphic functions. Let U and V be open subsets of the complex plane
C. A function
f : U →V
is called biholomorphic iﬀit is bijective and both f and f −1 are holomorphic. Bi-
holomorphic maps are always angle-preserving, that is, the oriented angles between
intersecting curves are preserved.
Conformal maps. Fix the point z0 of the complex plane and the complex
numbers a, b with b ̸= 0. The function
f(z) := a + b(z −z0),
z ∈C
is the superposition of a translation, a rotation around the center z0, and a similarity
transformation with respect to z0. Obviously, this map is angle-preserving and a
biholomorphic map f : C →C from the complex plane onto itself. Such a map is
called a conformal map of the complex plane onto itself. We want to generalize this
concept. To this end, let
f : U →C
(4.1)
be a holomorphic function on the nonempty open subset U of the complex plane.
This map is called a conformal map from U onto f(U) iﬀit is an angle-preserving
diﬀeomorphism1 from the set U onto the set f(U). For a function (4.1) on the
nonempty open subset U of the complex plane C, the following three properties are
equivalent.
(i) The map f is conformal from U onto f(U).
(ii) The function f : U →C is holomorphic, injective, and f ′(z0) ̸= 0 for all points
z0 in U.2
(ii) The set f(U) is open and the function f : U →f(U) is biholomorphic.
In the case (ii), the function f looks locally like
f(z) = f(z0) + f ′(z0)(z −z0) + . . . .
in a suﬃciently small open neighborhood of each point z0 ∈U. Because of the
condition f ′(z0) ̸= 0, the map f is not locally degenerate at z0.
Integrals. It turns out that integrals of holomorphic functions reﬂect topo-
logical properties of the domain of deﬁnition. Let the function f : U →C be
holomorphic, and let C : z = z(t), t0 ≤t ≤t1 be an oriented smooth curve in the
set U. Deﬁne

4.3 Cauchy’s Integral Formula
In recent years, progress in the theory of partial diﬀerential equations has
been tremendous, often in unexpected directions, while also solving classi-
cal problems in more general settings. New ﬁelds have been added, like the
study of variational inequalities, of solitons, of wave front sets, of pseudo-
diﬀerential operators, of diﬀerential forms on manifolds, and so on. Much
of the progress has been made by the use of functional analysis. However,
in the process much of the original simplicity of the theory has been lost.
This is perhaps connected with the emphasis of solving problems, which
often requires piling up mountains of a priori estimates and the skillful
juggling of function spaces to make ends meet. It is good to remember
that mathematics is not only concerned with solving problems, but also
with studying the structure and behavior of objects that it creates. One
of the best examples is classical theory of functions of a complex variable.
It, incidentally, does solve problems as in the Riemann mapping theorem.
But much of its beauty lies in statements that can hardly be considered
as “solving” anything, like the calculus of residues, or Cauchy’s integral

formula (4.3). The only “problem” solved by (4.3) is the improper one
of determining the function f from its boundary values, which generally
has no solution. Formula (4.3) is not only strikingly beautiful but also
extremely useful. It shows easily that each holomorphic function can be
diﬀerentiated inﬁnitely often and can be represented by convergent power
series.3

is called the principal part of the function f at the point z0.
The function f : U →C is called meromorphic on the open set U iﬀit is
holomorphic up to isolated poles. Rational functions (i.e., quotients of polynomials)
and the functions
tan z := sin z
cos z ,
cot z := cos z
sin z
are meromorphic on the complex plane. The poles correspond to the zeros of the
denominator. Meromorphic functions play a fundamental role in physics.
The poles of meromorphic functions describe essential physical properties
(e.g., the masses of elementary particles).
The following theorem is called Cauchy’s residue theorem.

if the following conditions are met: the circle C lies in the open set U, the function
f has precisely the poles z1, . . . , zm inside the circle C and no poles on C.
The integral is equal to zero if there are no poles on the closed disc bounded by
the circle C.
This is one of the most useful theorems in mathematics. For example, the function
f(z) :=
2iQ
1 + z2 =
Q
z −i −

has the residue resz=i(f) = 1 at the point z = i. If C1 is a counterclockwise oriented

We say that the function f has the topological charge Q at the point z = i.
The attribute ‘topological’ refers to the fact that this charge is invariant
under continuous deformations of the integration path.
Topological charges are also called topological quantum numbers.
4.5 The Winding Number
Let the functions f, g : U →R be meromorphic on the open set U, and let C be a
counterclockwise oriented circle lying in U. Suppose that no zeros or singularities
of f lie on C. Deﬁne

(E) Existence principle: If w(f) ̸= 0, then the equation f(z) = 0 has a solution
inside the circle C.

Let us apply the winding number to the fundamental theorem of algebra.
4.6 Gauss’ Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Finally, I note that it is not at all impossible that the proof, which I have
based on geometric principles here, be given in a purely analytic form; but
I believed the presentation which I developed here to be less abstract and
to expose better the essence of the proof than one could expect from an
analytic proof.
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
Thesis, 1799
Complex numbers were introduced by Bombelli in 1550; he used complex numbers
systematically in order to solve algebraic equations of third degree. The imaginary
unit, i, solves the equation z2 + 1 = 0, and we have the factorization
z2 + 1 = (z −i)(z + i).
The fundamental theorem of algebra tells us the following much more general result.
Theorem 4.3 Let n = 1, 2, . . . For each polynomial
p(z) := zn + an−1zn−1 + . . . + a1z + a0

216
4. Analyticity
with complex coeﬃcients a0, a1, . . . , there exist complex numbers z1, . . . , zn such
that
p(z) = (z −z1)(z −z2) · · · (z −zn)
for all
z ∈C.
Gauss proved this theorem for the ﬁrst time in his Ph.D. thesis7 in 1799. He reduced
this problem to the intersection problem for two real algebraic curves. To explain
the basic idea, consider the equation
z2 + 1 = 0,
z ∈C.
Letting z = x + yi, we get x2 −y2 + (2xy)i + 1 = 0. This problem is equivalent to
the system of equations
y2 −x2 = 1,
2xy = 0.
In terms of geometry, this system describes the intersection of a hyperbola with the
y-axis (Fig. 4.3). In the general case, Gauss had to study the intersection problem
for two algebraic curves of nth degree. The second and third proofs of this theorem,
given by Gauss in the years 1815 and 1816, were purely analytic, while the fourth
proof, on the 50th anniversary of his doctorate in 1849, was closely related to the
ﬁrst. In fact, the ﬁrst and the fourth proof contain a gap. Gauss assumed certain
properties of algebraic curves to be self-evident, which is not at all the case. This gap
was ﬁlled by Alexander Ostrowski in 1920 (see Ostrowski’s article in the Collected
Works of Gauss, Vol. 10). Let us give an elegant proof of the fundamental theorem
of algebra by using the winding number.
Proof. We proceed in two steps.
• Step 1: Existence of at least one zero. Set f(z) := zn, and p(z) = f(z) + g(z).
Choose a counterclockwise oriented circle C of radius R centered at the origin.
Then |f(z)| = Rn on C. Furthermore,
|g(z)| ≤
n−1
X
k=0
|ak| · |zk| ≤const · Rn−1
on C.
If we choose the radius R suﬃciently large, then the perturbation property (P)
of the winding number above tells us that
w(p) = w(f + g) = w(f) = n.
By the existence principle (E), p(z1) = 0 for some z1.
• Step 2: Factorization. By the Taylor theorem,
p(z) = p(z1) + (z −z1)
`
p′(z1) + 1
2p′′(z1)(z −z1)2 + . . .
´
.
Hence p(z) = (z −z1)q(z) where q is a polynomial of degree n −1. By induction,
we obtain the claim.
2
Intuition. The geometric idea behind the argument from step 1 is quite simple.
The map z →zn sends the circle C to a circle which winds n times around the
origin. If the radius R is suﬃciently large, then the map z →p(z) sends the circle
C to a curve which winds n times around the origin as well, by a perturbation
argument. By continuity, there must exist some point z1 inside the circle C which

is mapped to the origin, that is, p(z1) = 0. The point z1 is the desired zero of the
given polynomial p.
Gauss implicitly used this intuitive argument, but he had to argue in a more
sophisticated way, since he did not have the rigorous theory of the winding number
at hand.
4.7 Compactiﬁcation of the Complex Plane
Each bounded sequence (zn) in the complex plane contains a convergent subse-
quence. This important property is not always true for unbounded sequences. In
order to cure this defect, we add the symbol ∞to the complex plane C. The set
C := C ∪{∞}
is called the closed complex plane.
The Riemann sphere. The unit sphere
S2 := {(x, y, ζ) ∈R3 :
x2 + y2 + ζ2 = 1}
in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space is called the Riemann sphere. Naturally
enough, the point N := (0, 0, 1) is called the North Pole of S2. Using Fig. 4.4,
we set χ(z) := P. The map
χ : C →S2 \ {N}
can be extended to a map χ : C →S2 by setting χ(∞) := N. A sequence (zn) in
the closed complex plane is said to converge to the point z iﬀthis is true for the
corresponding points on the Riemann sphere. We now get the desired convergence
theorem:
Each sequence in the closed complex plane has a convergent subsequence.
We call the closed complex plane a compactiﬁcation of the complex plane. In modern
mathematics, the compactiﬁcation of mathematical objects is used very frequently.
Using the topological terminology introduced in Sect. 5.5 on page 239, the Rie-
mann sphere S2 is a compact topological space, and the closed complex plane C is
homeomorphic to the Riemann sphere. The inverse map χ−1 : S2 \ N →C is called
stereographic projection.
By deﬁnition, a function f is called locally holomorphic at the point z = ∞iﬀ
the function

4. Analyticity
is locally holomorphic at the point z = 0. For example, the functions
f(z) := 1
zn ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
are locally holomorphic at the point z = ∞.
Theorem 4.4 Each holomorphic function from the closed complex plane into itself
is constant.
This theorem is named after Liouville, but it was ﬁrst proved by Cauchy in 1844. We
want to use this theorem in order to give an alternative proof of the fundamental
theorem of algebra. By our argument above, it is suﬃcient to prove that each
polynomial of order n ≥1 has a zero.
Application to the fundamental theorem of algebra. Suppose that the
polynomial p has no zeros on the complex plane. Deﬁne
f(z) :=
1
p(z),
z ∈C,
and set f(∞) := 0. Since the function f behaves like 1/zn near the point ∞, it
is locally holomorphic at ∞. Thus, the function f is holomorphic on the closed
complex plane, and hence it is constant, a contradiction.
2
The Liouville Theorem 4.4 is the prototype of a mathematical theorem which
relates the structure of analytic objects to the topology of the space on which the
objects live. In terms of physics, this corresponds to the situation that the structure
of physical ﬁelds depends on the topological structure of the underlying space-time
manifold.
4.8 Analytic Continuation and the Local-Global
Principle
Let f, g : U →R be holomorphic functions on the open, arcwise connected set U
such that
f(zn) = g(zn)
for all
n = 1, 2, . . . ,
and the sequence (zn) with zn ̸= a for all n converges to some point a in U as
n →+∞. Then f = g on U.
Let U and V be open, arcwise connected sets in the complex plane such that
U ⊂V. If f : U →C and F : V →C are holomorphic and f = F on U, then F is
called the holomorphic (or analytic) extension of f. This holomorphic (or analytic)
continuation is uniquely determined. For example, the power series
f(z) = 1 + z + z2 + . . .
is convergent for all z ∈C with |z| < 1. Since f(z) =
1
1−z , the function f can be
uniquely extended to the holomorphic function F : C \ {1} →C given by
F(z) :=
1
1 −z
for all
z ∈C, z ̸= 1.
As a second example, consider the energy function

E > 0.

Counterexample. The fact that a function allows a holomorphic extension
represents important and highly nontrivial information, as the following simple
counterexample (ii) shows.
(i) Consider the real function f : [ 1
2, 1] →R deﬁned by f(x) := x. There exist
inﬁnitely many smooth functions g : R →R which are extensions of f, but
there is only one holomorphic extension, namely, f(z) := z for all z ∈C.
(ii) Modifying the preceding example, set
f(x) := |x|
if either x ∈[ 1
2, 1] or x ∈[−1, −1
2]. There exist inﬁnitely many smooth ex-
tensions g : R →R of the function f, but no holomorphic extension. To see
this, suppose that there exists such an extension. This extension would be
uniquely determined by the values of f on the interval [ 1
2, 1]. By (i), f(x) = x
on [−1, −1
2], a contradiction.
Generalization of terminology. Let D be an arbitrary subset of the complex
plane (e.g., the closed unit disc). The function
f : D →C
is called holomorphic iﬀthere exists a holomorphic function g : U →C such that D
is a subset of the open set U and f = g on D. A function is called locally holomorphic
at a point z0 iﬀit is deﬁned and holomorphic on some open neighborhood of the
point z0.
4.9 Integrals and Riemann Surfaces
Algebraic integrals. Let R = R(z, w) be a rational function with respect to the
complex variables z and w (i.e., R is the quotient of two polynomials with respect
to z and w). By an algebraic integral or Abelian integral, we mean an integral of
the form
Z
C
R(z, w(z))dz
where C is a curve, and the function w = w(z) is given by the equation
wn + pn−1(z)wn−1 + . . . + p1(z)w + p0(z) = 0,
z, w ∈C.
(4.5)

220
4. Analyticity
Here, p0, p1, . . . are polynomials. Such integrals were ﬁrst studied by Abel (1802–
1829). In an ingenious way, Riemann (1826–1866) discovered that algebraic integrals
can be understood best by using the topological concept of the Riemann surface.
Let us explain this by considering a simple example.
The Riemann surface of the logarithmic function. For each given complex
number z ̸= 0, the equation
z = ew,
w ∈C
has a set of solutions which we denote by w = ln z. Explicitly,
lnz = ln |z| + i arg z + 2πk,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
(4.6)
This function is many-valued on the punctured complex plane C \ {0}. It was
Riemann’s idea to construct a set R such that the function
ln : R →C
is single-valued on R. This can be done easily. To this end, set
Sk := C \ {0},
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
We cut each sheet Sk along the negative real axis, and we glue the sheets along the
cuts together in the following way.
• If we start from the point z = 1 on the sheet S0, and we move counterclockwise
along the unit circle, then we change from the sheet Sk to the sheet Sk+1 at the
point z = −1 where k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
• Similarly, if we start from the point z = 1 at the sheet S0 and we move clockwise
along the unit circle, then we change from Sk to Sk−1 at the point z = −1 where
k = 0, −1, −2, . . .
Furthermore, if z ∈Sk, then we deﬁne ln z := ln |z| + i arg z + 2πk. The set R is
called the Riemann surface of the function ln . This is an ‘inﬁnite round staircase’.
If we cut the sheet S0 along the negative real axis, then the restriction
ln : S0\ ] −∞, 0] →C
is called the principal branch of the logarithmic function; this function is single-
valued and holomorphic. Explicitly, for the principal branch,
ln z = ln |z| + i arg z,
−π < arg z < π.
For all complex numbers z with |z| < 1, the principal branch allows the power series
expansion
ln(1 + z) = z −z2
2 + z3
3 −. . .
Application to integrals. The idea of the Riemann surface is extremely useful
for computing curve integrals.
The point is that we have to choose curves on the Riemann surface of the
primitive function to the integrand.

4.9 Integrals and Riemann Surfaces
221
For example, consider the smooth curve C : z = z(t), t0 ≤t ≤t1. By the funda-
mental theorem of calculus,
Z
C
dz
z = ln z(t1) −ln z(t0).
However, this value is not well-deﬁned, since the logarithmic function is many-
valued. This defect can be cured completely if we regard C as a curve on the
Riemann surface R of the logarithmic function. For example, let C denote the
counterclockwise oriented unit circle on the complex plane. Now regard C as a
curve on the Riemann surface R of the logarithmic function. For example, let us
start at the point z = 1 on the sheet S0. Moving counterclockwise, we end up at
the point z = 1 on the sheet S1. Hence
Z
C
dz
z = lnS1 z(t1) −lnS0 z(t0) = lnS1 1 −lnS0 1 = 2πi.
The same result is obtained by using Cauchy’s residue theorem. The Riemann
surface R reveals the natural background of the residue theorem.
Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces. The real equation
w −z = 0,
z, w ∈R
represents a real curve, namely, a straight line through the origin. The complex
equation
w −z = 0,
z, w ∈C
represents a complex curve (also called 1-dimensional complex manifold). This com-
plex curve corresponds to the complex plane, C, which is equivalent to the two-
dimensional real plane,8 R2. If we compactify the complex plane, C, then we obtain
the closed complex plane, C, which is in one-to-one correspondence to the Riemann
sphere, S2. In terms of the theory of manifolds to be introduced in Sect. 5.4 on page
234, Riemann surfaces are deﬁned to be 1-dimensional, complex, arcwise connected
manifolds. Using this terminology, the following hold true:
The closed complex plane and the Riemann sphere are conformally equiv-
alent compact Riemann surfaces of genus zero.
Furthermore, the real equation
w2 −z = 0,
z, w ∈R
describes a parabola. The complex extension
w2 −z = 0,
z, w ∈C
describes the Riemann surface to the function w = √z. After compactiﬁcation,
this is a compact Riemann surface which is conformally equivalent to the Riemann
sphere. More generally, each of the algebraic equations (4.5) describes, after passing
to connected components and using compactiﬁcation, a compact Riemann surface
of genus g where g = 0, 1, 2, . . . In 1907, Poincar´e and Koebe proved independently
the famous uniformization theorem telling us that
Each algebraic curve (and hence each compact Riemann surface) possesses
a global smooth parametrization z = z(t), w = w(t) for all parameters
t ∈T
8 Traditionally, the notion complex curve (resp. plane or surface) corresponds to
a space of complex dimension one (resp. real dimension two).

where the parameter space T has to be chosen in an appropriate manner. This
way, many special functions of mathematical physics appear as parametrizations of
algebraic curves (trigonometric functions, elliptic functions, modular functions, and
automorphic functions). For example, the complex unit circle, that is, the complex
curve
z2 + w2 −1 = 0,
z, w ∈C
possesses the global parametrization z = cos t, w = sin t, t ∈C. Let e1, e2, e3 be
three pairwise diﬀerent complex numbers. Then, the algebraic curve
w2 −4(z −e1)(z −e2)(z −e3) = 0,
z, w ∈C
(4.7)
possesses the global parametrization z = ℘(t), w = ℘′(t), t ∈C where ℘denotes
the Weiererstrass elliptic function (i.e., ℘is double-periodic). The Riemann surface
of the algebraic curve (4.7) is conformally equivalent to a torus which has always
the genus g = 1. The Riemann surface to the complex curve
z −ew = 0,
z, w ∈C
is nothing other than the Riemann surface to the function w = ln z.
The space of string states. Riemann surfaces and their applications in string
theory will be studied in Volume VI. At this point let us only mention that
Compact Riemann surfaces correspond to string states; conformally equiv-
alent Riemann surfaces represent the same string state.
In this modern terminology, the space of string states corresponds to Riemann’s
classical moduli space. If g denotes the genus of the string state, then the following
are met:
(i) If g ≥2, then the space of string states can be parametrized by 3g −3 complex
parameters.
(ii) If g = 0, then there exists a unique string state which corresponds to the
Riemann sphere.
(ii) If g = 1, then the string states correspond to tori. The space of string states is
in one-to-one correspondence to the subset M1 of the complex upper half-plane
pictured in Fig. 4.5. Therefore, the string states can be parameterized by one
complex parameter. Explicitly, we start with the strip
{−1
2 < ℜ(z) ≤1
2, ℑ(z) > 0}.
We take away the points of the strip that lie in the closed unit disc, and we
add the arc {z ∈C : |z| = 1, ℜ(z) ≥0} of the unit circle.

4.10 Domains of Holomorphy

For genus g ≥1, the string state space is not a manifold, but has singularities.
The theory of Riemann surfaces and its generalizations has played a key role in the
development of modern algebraic geometry.

4.10 Domains of Holomorphy
Physically interpretable functions obtained by analytic continuation from
functions describing physical phenomena also describe physical phenom-
ena: they are not mere mathematical chimeras. . . It turns out that the
Wightman distributions9 are boundary values of holomorphic functions of
N variables, the Wightman functions, and these have proved to be a very
useful tool for investigating axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory.
Res Jost, 1965
The General Theory of Quantized Fields10
It turns out that there exists a crucial diﬀerence between holomorphic functions on
the complex plane and holomorphic functions on the higher-dimensional complex
spaces C2, C3, . . . This concerns analytic continuation. Let us discuss this. For an
open set U in CN, the function f : U →CN is called holomorphic on U iﬀthe
partial derivatives
∂f
∂zj ,
j = 1, . . . , N
exist on U. This is equivalent to the fact that the function f can be locally rep-
resented by a power series expansion which converges absolutely in some open
neighborhood of each point in U.
9 The Wightman distributions are the averaged vacuum expectation values of
products of quantum ﬁelds.

4. Analyticity
An open, arcwise connected subset U of
CN is called a domain of holo-
morphy iﬀthere exists a holomorphic function f : U →C which cannot
be extended to a holomorphic function on a larger open, arcwise connected
set.
On the complex plane C, each open, arcwise connected set U is a domain of holo-
morphy. This theorem does not remain true for C2, C3, . . . For example, consider
the set
W := {(z1, z2) ∈C2 : 1
2 < |z| < 1}
with |z| :=
p
|z1|2 + |z2|2. Then, each holomorphic function f : W →C can be
extended to a holomorphic function f : U →C on the open unit ball
U := {(z1, z2) ∈C2 : |z| < 1},
but a further extension to a larger open set is not always possible. This tells us that
the open set W is not a domain of holomorphy. In contrast to this, the open ball
U is a domain of holomorphy. This is a special case of the following more general
result:
Each convex open subset of CN is a domain of holomorphy.
The famous 1938 Bochner theorem on the analytic continuation of functions of
several variables tells us the following. Consider a so-called tube
RN + iΩ:= {(x + yi) : x ∈RN, y ∈Ω}
where Ωis a convex open subset of RN, N = 1, 2, . . . .
Theorem 4.5 If a function f is locally holomorphic at some point of the tube R +
iω, then it can be holomorphically extended to the tube. But a further holomorphic
extension to a larger open set in CN is not always possible.
This theorem tells us that the tube RN +iΩis a domain of holomorphy in CN. The
proofs can be found in Vladimirov (1966).
4.11 A Glance at Analytic S-Matrix Theory
In the 1950s and 1960s, physicists thoroughly studied scattering processes for ele-
mentary particles by using analytic continuation for the S-matrix and the Green’s
functions. If these functions have a singularity at the complex energy
E = E0 + i∆E,
then there exists an elementary particle with rest mass m0 = E0/c2 and mean
lifetime ∆t = ℏ/∆E. As an introduction to analytic S-matrix theory, we recommend

5. A Glance at Topology
Topology is precisely that mathematical discipline which allows a passage
from the local to the global.
Ren´e Thom (1923–2002)
Topology studies the qualitative behavior of mathematical and physical objects.
The following results discussed in the preceding chapter are related to topology:
• deformation invariance of the integral of holomorphic functions,
• Cauchy’s residue theorem,
• properties of the winding number,
• Liouville’s theorem,
• analytic continuation of holomorphic functions,
• Abelian integrals and Riemann surfaces.
Topology was created by Poincar´e (1854–1912) at the end of the 19th century
and was motivated by the investigation of Riemann surfaces and the qualitative
behavior of the orbits of planets, asteroids, and comets in celestial mechanics.1
Topology studies far-reaching generalizations of the results summarized above.
5.1 Local and Global Properties of the Universe
Since ancient times, scientists have made enormous eﬀorts to understand
• the macrocosmos – our universe – and
• the microcosmos – the world of elementary particles.
A uniﬁed theory for the four fundamental forces in nature (i.e., strong, weak, elec-
tromagnetic, and gravity) has the task to combine the macrocosmos with the micro-
cosmos. In Fig. 5.1, two 1-dimensional models of the universe are pictured. These
two models possess the same local structure near the earth, but the global struc-
tures are completely diﬀerent. To illustrate this, consider a spaceship starting on
earth and moving the same direction all the time. In a closed universe, the spaceship
may return to earth, whereas this is impossible in an open universe. Note that in
reality, the universe is expanding. This means that the radius of the closed universe
in Fig. 5.1(a) is expanding in time. At the time of the Big Bang, the universe was
concentrated at one point.
The study of the global behavior of geometric objects is the subject of topol-
ogy. We expect that the topology of the global universe inﬂuences the physics of
elementary particles. As an example, consider a photon of wave length λ. If the

radius of our universe r is ﬁnite, then we get the inequality λ ≤r. This implies that
there exists a lower bound (or cut-oﬀ) for the energy of photons,
E = hc
λ ≥hc
r .
In fact, the so-called infrared (or low-energy) catastrophe of quantum electrody-
namics concerns mathematical problems which arise at low energies (λ →+∞).
It is thinkable that our universe possesses a very strange global structure which
results from the cooling process after the Big Bang. For example, we know that the
freezing of water can produce bizarre ice ﬂowers. In Fig. 5.2(a), the earth E and a
distant galaxy G are connected by a wormhole W which allows fast travelling from
E to G by leaving the regular universe and entering the hyperspace.2
In Fig 5.2(b), we picture a singularity S which is observed in a 1-dimensional
universe. This singularity can be obtained by projecting a regular space curve with-
out singularities (e.g., without self-intersections) onto a plane. In algebraic geome-
try, this method is widely used for the so-called blowing-up of singularities.
It is thinkable that the complex structure of the observed 4-dimensional
space-time physics results from a much simpler physics in higher dimen-
sions.
This is one of the hopes of all the physicists who are working in the theory of
strings and d-dimensional branes.3 This explains why topology enters more and
more into modern physics. Of course, there is much room for fancy ideas and wild
speculations.
5.2 Bolzano’s Existence Principle
We are going to consider the prototype of a topological theorem on the intersection
of continuous curves which dates back to Bolzano (1781-1848).
The mapping degree. For a real continuous function f : [0, 1] →R with
f(0) ̸= 0 and f(1) ̸= 0, we deﬁne the mapping degree deg(f) by setting
deg(f) :=
8

<

:
1
if
f(0) < 0, f(1) > 0,
−1
if
f(0) > 0, f(1) < 0,
0
if
f(0)f(1) > 0.
2 The theory of wormholes was developed by Wheeler in the 1950s (see Thorne
(1993)).

If the function is smooth and has only a ﬁnite number of zeros x1, ..., xN along with
f ′(xj) ̸= 0 for all j, then
deg(f) = sgn f ′(x1) + ... + sgn f ′(xN).
In geometric terms, the mapping degree coincides with the intersection number
between the x-axis and the graph of f (Fig. 5.3).
In 1817 Bolzano published a fundamental paper. In the introduction, he wrote
the following.
There are two theorems of which it could be said that until recently a
completely correct proof of the same was unknown. One is the fundamental
theorem of algebra proved by Gauss in his 1799 dissertation; the other one
is the following theorem: That between two quantities of unknown size
which evince a result of opposite sign, there must lie at least one root of
the equation.
In modern language, Bolzano’s theorem reads as follows.
The continuous function f : [0, 1] →R has a zero if f(0)f(1) < 0.
Intuitively, the condition f(0)f(1) < 0 tells us that the function f has diﬀerent
signs at the two end points x = 0 and x = 1, and hence the graph of f has to

intersect the x-axis. In terms of the mapping degree, the Bolzano theorem reads as
follows. We are given a continuous function f : [0, 1] →R which does not vanish on
the boundary of the interval.
If deg(f) ̸= 0, then the function f has a zero.
Invariance of the mapping degree under deformations of the maps.
Consider a ﬁnite time interval [t0, t1]. Suppose that we are given two continuous
functions f, g : [0, 1] →R. Then, we get
deg(f) = deg(g)
if there exists a continuous map
H : [0, 1] × [t0, t1] →R
such that H(x, t0) = f(x) and H(x, t1) = g(x) for all x ∈[0, 1]. Furthermore, we
have to assume that H(x, t) ̸= 0 for the boundary points x = 0, 1 and all times
t ∈[t0, t1].
Perspectives. The Bolzano theorem represents one of the most fundamental
topological existence principles in mathematics. It allows far-reaching generaliza-
tions
• to the Euclidean spaces Rn, n = 1, 2, . . . (the Brouwer mapping degree introduced
in 1910)
• and to inﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces (the Leray–Schauder mapping degree
introduced in 1936)
• along with numerous applications to diﬀerential and integral equations.
This can be found in the author’s monographs Zeidler (1986), Vols. I–IV.

(resp.

iﬀthe curve c2 can be obtained from the curve c1 by a counterclockwise (resp.
clockwise) rotation about the point P with positive rotation angle 0 < ϕ < π
(Figs. 5.4(a), (b)).
• Global intersection number i(c1, c2) for two oriented plane curves: This is equal
to the sum of local intersection numbers provided this number is ﬁnite (Fig.
5.4(e)).
• Local intersection number of an oriented curve and an oriented 2-dimensional
surface: This is deﬁned as pictured in Figs. 5.4(c), (d).
• Global intersection number of an oriented curve and an oriented 2-dimensional
surface: This is deﬁned to be the sum of the local intersection numbers.
• Linking number for two closed curves in the 3-dimensional space: This is re-
duced to the intersection number between an oriented curve and an oriented
2-dimensional surface as pictured in Fig. 5.5.
• Winding number: For a given plane curve, the winding number w tells us how
many times the curve surrounds the origin, taking orientation into account, as
pictured in Figs. 5.6(b)-(g). Note that the winding number is equal to the inter-
section number between a ray L through the origin and the curve (Figs. 5.6(f),
(g)).

Fig. 5.7. Mapping degree
• Local mapping degree: Consider maps as pictured in Fig. 5.7. If f(P) = P ′ and f
preserves (resp. reverses) orientation in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the
point P, then we set
degP f := 1
(resp. degP f = −1).
• Global mapping degree: If a map f : A →B globally preserves (resp. reverses)
orientation, then we set
deg f := 1
(resp. deg f = −1).
If this is not the case, then we choose an image point P ′ and deﬁne
deg f := degP1 f + ... + degPn f
(5.1)
where the points P1, ..., Pn are precisely the preimage points of P ′. Mnemonically,
the global mapping degree is the sum of local mapping degrees with respect to
a ﬁxed image point P ′. It turns out that, roughly speaking, this deﬁnition does
not depend on the choice of the image point P ′. In the plane, winding number
and mapping degree coincide.
The strategy of putting in general position. The deﬁnition given above
for the intersection number of two curves refers tacitly to transversal intersection.
This excludes the degenerate case where the two curves touch each other (Fig.
5.8(c)). In the degenerate case, we proceed in the following quite natural manner:
We slightly perturb the curves such that
(a) either they intersect transversally each other (Fig. 5.8(a)) or
(b) they do not intersect at all (Fig. 5.8(b)).
It is now crucial that in both perturbed regular cases, we obtain the same well-
deﬁned intersection number, namely, zero. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the
intersection number zero to the degenerate situation of Fig. 5.8(c). This is part
of a general strategy used in modern diﬀerential topology. This strategy reads as
follows:

Fig. 5.8. General position
Put geometric objects in general position by suﬃciently small perturbations,
and assign integers to the general position conﬁguration.
It turns out that general position can always be formulated in terms of transver-
sality. The point is that
Transversality is generic.
This means that the transversal situation can always be obtained by suﬃciently
small perturbations. Finally, one has to show that the integer assigned to the
transversal situation is stable, that is, it does not depend on the speciﬁc form of
the small perturbation, as in Fig. 5.8. The prototype for the success of this strategy
is the following simple variant of the Sard theorem. Consider the equation
f(x) = y0,
x ∈R.
(5.2)
We are given the real number y0. Let f : R →R be a smooth function such that
lim
|x|→∞|f(x)| = ∞.
Then, there exist a sequence (εn) with εn →0 such that, for each index n, the
perturbed equation
f(x) = y0 + εn,
x ∈R
has at most a ﬁnite number of solutions x1, ..., xN, and each solution is nondegen-
erate, that is,
f ′(xj) ̸= 0
for all
j.
In terms of geometry, this means that the graph of f transversally intersects the

5.4 Manifolds and Diﬀeomorphisms
The theory of manifolds studies smooth maps between geometric objects. Roughly
speaking, manifolds are smooth curves and smooth surfaces along with higher-
dimensional generalizations (e.g., m-dimensional spheres or Lie groups).
Intuitive motivation. The prototype of a real 2-dimensional manifold is the
surface of earth, M. In geography, we describe parts of the earth locally by charts
(subsets of R2) of an atlas (Fig. 5.10). Here, the same city can be located on
diﬀerent charts. Therefore, we need transition maps between charts. The following
two properties are typical:
• the surface M is locally described by local coordinates living in open subsets of
the 2-dimensional Euclidean space R2, and
• the change of local coordinates is carried out by smooth functions.
Generally, a real m-dimensional manifold M looks locally like an open subset of
Rm, and the change of local coordinates is done by diﬀeomorphisms. To explain
this, let U and V be two open subsets of Rm. The map
f : U →V
(5.3)
is called smooth iﬀit is continuous and its components have continuous partial
derivatives of each order. The smooth map (5.3) is called a diﬀeomorphism iﬀit
is bijective and smooth, and the inverse map f −1 : V →U is smooth as well. For
example, set f(x) := ex. Then, the map
f : R →]0, ∞[
is a diﬀeomorphism. The inverse map reads as f −1(x) := ln x for all x ∈]0, ∞[.
The deﬁnitions can be immediately generalized to the situation where U and
V are open subsets of the complex plane, C, or more generally, open subsets of
the m-dimensional complex space, Cm. In particular, the map f : U →V is a
4 The proof along with far-reaching generalizations to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces
due to Smale can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, Sect. 4.18. As an introduc-
tion to diﬀerential topology based on the transversality strategy, we recommend
Guillemin and Pollack (1974).
5 In 1958 Thom was awarded the Fields medal for his pioneering contributions to
the global theory of manifolds (cobordism theory).

5.5 Topological Spaces, Homeomorphisms, and Deformations
235
diﬀeomorphism iﬀit is bijective and the maps f and f −1 are smooth. In the special
case where m = 1, diﬀeomorphisms coincide with conformal maps.
Deﬁnition of real manifolds. The precise deﬁnition of a manifold reads like
this (Fig. 5.10).
(M1) A real m-dimensional manifold is a set M along with a (ﬁnite or countable)
family of bijective maps6
ϕA : MA →UA.
(5.4)
Here, MA is a subset of M, and UA is a nonempty open subset of Rm. We call
xA = ϕA(x) the local coordinate of the point x ∈M, and ϕA is called a chart
map.
(M2) If the point x lies both in MA and MB, then there are assigned the two local
coordinates
xA = ϕA(x)
and
xB = ϕB(x)
to the point x. In this case, we assume that the transition map
xB = ϕBA(xA)
is a diﬀeomorphism on its natural domain of deﬁnition. Explicitly, we have
ϕBA = ϕB ◦ϕ−1
A
on the set ϕA(MA ∩MB).7
The manifold is called oriented iﬀall of the transition maps preserve orientation.
Morphisms. Let M and N be manifolds. By a manifold morphism, we under-
stand a smooth map
f : M →N,
that is, this map is smooth with respect to local coordinates. Furthermore, the
smooth map f : M →N is called a manifold isomorphism iﬀit is bijective and the
inverse map f −1 : N →M is also smooth. Manifold isomorphisms are also called
diﬀeomorphisms.
Complex manifolds. Similarly, the notion of complex m-dimensional manifold
is obtained by replacing open subsets of the real m-dimensional space Rm by open
subsets of the complex m-dimensional space Cm. Complex 1-dimensional manifolds
are also called regular complex curves. By a Riemann surface, we understand an
arcwise connected, regular complex curve. Diﬀeomorphic Riemann surfaces are also
called conformally equivalent.
Convention. If we do not explicitly state otherwise, by a manifold we always
understand a real ﬁnite-dimensional manifold.
5.5 Topological Spaces, Homeomorphisms, and
Deformations
Topology studies continuous maps between geometric objects. The notion of topo-
logical space was introduced by Hausdorﬀin 1914.8 Topological spaces generalize
manifolds. For example, the graph of the curve
6 The index A lies in the set A. We assume that the index set A is either ﬁnite or
equal to the set of natural numbers. Naturally enough, suppose that each point
of M lies in some set MA.
7 Naturally enough, we assume that the set ϕA(MA ∩MB) is an open subset of
the chart space Rm.

y = x2/3,
x ∈R
is a topological space, but not a manifold because of the singularity (cusp) at the
point (0, 0). For ﬁxed genus g ≥2, spaces of string states (i.e., the Riemann moduli
spaces) are topological spaces, but not manifolds because of the appearance of
singularities. The prototype of a topological space is a subset of Rn with n = 1, 2, . . .
or a point. Roughly speaking, we pass from manifolds to topological spaces by
replacing ‘smooth’ by ‘continuous.’
Deﬁnition. A set X is called a topological space iﬀcertain subsets S of X are
distinguished as open sets such that the following hold:
(T1) Both the set X and the empty set ∅are open.
(T2) The union of each arbitrary family of open sets is open.
(T3) The intersection of each ﬁnite family of open sets is open.
The family of all open sets is called a topology. By an open open neighborhood of
the point x in X, we understand an open subset of X which contains the point x.9
The topological space X is called separated iﬀfor any two diﬀerent points x, y ∈X,
there exist disjoint open neighborhoods of x and y. A subset C of the topological
space X is called closed iﬀthe complement X \ C is open.
Each subset M of a topological space X is also a topological space.
By deﬁnition, a subset V of M is called open iﬀthere exists an open subset U of
X such that
V = U ∩M.
The topology of M is called the topology induced by X.
Morphisms. Let X and Y be topological spaces. The map
f : X →Y
is called continuous (or a topological morphism) iﬀthe preimage of open sets is
again open. The continuous map f : X →Y is called a topological isomorphism
iﬀit is bijective and the inverse map f −1 : Y →X is continuous, too. Topological
isomorphisms are also called homeomorphisms.
Standard examples. In order to give the reader a feeling for the universality
of the notion of topological space, let us consider the following examples.
• For n = 0, 1, . . . , the sets Rn and Cn and their subsets are topological spaces.
• Every Hilbert space and Banach space and their subsets are topological spaces.
• Every real (resp. complex) ﬁnite-dimensional manifold is a topological space.
• For n = 1, 2, . . . , the n-dimensional unit sphere
Sn := {x ∈Rn+1 : x2
1 + x2
2 + . . . + x2
n+1 = 1}
is an n-dimensional real manifold.
• Deﬁne F(ϕ) := eiϕ for all ϕ ∈R. The continuous map
F : R →S1
sends the real line onto the unit circle S1. This is not a
homeomorphism. We say that the real line R is a covering space of the unit circle.
9 More generally, by a neighborhood of the point x, we understand an arbitrary
set which contains an open neighborhood of the point x.

• Consider the interval [−π, π] and identify the point −π with π. This way, we
obtain a topological space denoted by [−π, π]/{−π, π} which is homeomorphic
to the unit circle S1. Explicitly, the homeomorphism is given by the map
h : [−π, π]/{−π, π} →S1
where h(ϕ) := eiϕ for all ϕ ∈[−π, π].
• The n-dimensional real projective space Pn is an n-dimensional real manifold
obtained by considering antipodal pairs as one point. That is, the elements of Pn
are antipodal pairs {x, −x}.
• For n = 1, 2, . . . . the groups SU(n), U(n), SO(n) are manifolds. More general,
each Lie group is a real manifold.
• For the rotation group of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space,
SO(3) = {(n, ϕ) :
n ∈P2, ϕ ∈S1}.
Here, the unit vector n represents the rotation axis, and ϕ represents the rotation
angle. Note that each rotation about the axis n can also be described by a rotation
about the axis −n. We brieﬂy write
SO(3) = P2 × S1.
More precisely, the manifold SO(3) is diﬀeomorphic to the manifold P2×S1. This
shows that the Lie group SO(3) possesses a nontrivial topological structure. We
will show in Sect. 5.7.1 on page 265 that the topology of SO(3) is responsible for
the electron spin.
• Riemann surfaces are 2-dimensional real manifolds and 1-dimensional complex
manifolds.
Each diﬀeomorphism is a homeomorphism, but the converse is not true. To explain
this, consider the two maps
f(x) := x3,
g(x) := sinh x
for all
x ∈R
pictured in Fig. 5.11. Then, the map g : R →R is a diﬀeomorphism, whereas
f : R →R is a homeomorphism, but not a diﬀeomorphism. In fact, the inverse map
f −1(x) := x1/3 is not smooth at the point x = 0.
Deformations. We want to study the deformation of both geometric objects
(topological spaces) and continuous maps. We expect that
Crucial phenomena in nature should be invariant under continuous defor-
mations.
The prototypes of deformations are given by the following two maps

238
5. A Glance at Topology
(i) H(x, t) := (1 −t)x for all x ∈R, t ∈[0, 1], and
(ii) H(x, t) := (1 −t)f(x) + tg(t) for all x ∈R, t ∈[0, 1].
We regard the variable t as time. The map (i) contracts the real line into the origin
during the time interval [0, 1]. The trajectory
x(t) := (1 −t)x,
t ∈[0, 1]
sends the point x at the initial time t = 0 to the origin x = 0 at the ﬁnal time
t = 1. If the functions f, g : R →R are continuous, then the map (ii) continuously
deforms the function f into g. This motivates the following deﬁnitions.
• Homotopic continuous maps: Let X and Y be topologically spaces. Two con-
tinuous maps f, g : X →Y are called homotopic iﬀthere exists a continuous
map
H : X × [0, 1] →Y
such that H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x ∈X. Intuitively, the map
f is continuously deformed into the map g during the time interval [0, 1]. The
map f : X →Y is called homotopically trivial iﬀit is homotopic to a constant
map g : X →Y.
• Homotopically equivalent topological spaces: The two topological spaces X and
Y are called homotopically equivalent iﬀthere exists a map
f : X →Y
which is invertible up to deformations. We brieﬂy write X ∼Y. Explicitly, this
means the following. There exists a map
g : Y →X
such that f ◦g : Y →Y is homotopic to the identity map on Y , and g◦f : X →X
is homotopic to the identity map on X. We brieﬂy write
f ◦g ∼idY
and
g ◦f ∼idX.
If f : X →Y is a homeomorphism, then the topological space X is called topolog-
ically equivalent to the topological space Y . This implies that X is homotopically
equivalent to Y . To see this, choose g := f −1.
Standard examples. We want to consider contractible topological spaces and
deformation retracts.
• A topological space is called contractible iﬀit is homotopically equivalent to a
one-point space.10 Explicitly, this means the following. Let x0 be a point of the
topological space X. Suppose that there exists a continuous map
H : X × [0, 1] →X
such that H(x, 0) = x and H(x, 1) = x0 for all x ∈X. Then, the space X is
contractible to the point x0.
• Retract: Let Y be a subset of a the topological space X. The continuous map
r : X →Y
is called a retract iﬀit is continuous and it ﬁxes the points of Y , that is, r(y) = y
for all y ∈Y.
10 Contractible topological spaces are also called homotopically trivial.

• Deformation retract: If, in addition, the retraction r is homotopic to the identity
map on X, then Y is called a deformation retract of X. Explicitly, this means
that there exists a continuous map
H : X × [0, 1] →X
such that H(x, 0) = x for all x ∈X and H(y, 1) = y for all y ∈Y.
For example, the real line and each interval is contractible, but the unit sphere
S1 is not contractible. Furthermore, for n = 2, 3, . . . , each n-dimensional ball is
contractible. Let x, y ∈R2. Then, the map
(x, y) →(x, 0)
is a retraction, and the x-axis is a deformation retract of the (x, y)-plane.
Topological invariants. Suppose that we assign a mathematical object to a
class of topological spaces.
• This object is called a topological invariant iﬀit is invariant under homeomor-
phisms.
• This object is called a homotopy invariant iﬀit is the same for homotopically
equivalent topological spaces.
The most important topological invariant is the Euler characteristic to be intro-
duced below. Topological invariants play a fundamental role in mathematics and
physics (e.g., Betti numbers, Gauss’ linking number, genus of a Riemannian surface,
winding number, mapping degree, Morse index of a dynamical system, characteristic
classes, Stiefel–Whitney classes, Chern classes and Chern numbers, Atiyah–Singer
index, Gromov–Witten invariants, Donaldson invariants of 4-dimensional manifolds,
Seiberg–Witten invariants, Jones polynomials of knots, homology groups, cohomol-
ogy groups, homotopy groups, K-groups as generalized cohomology groups). We
will study this thoroughly in Volume IV on quantum mathematics. At this point,
we will only sketch same basic ideas.
As a rule, topological invariants are also homotopy invariants.
Compactness. A topological space X is called compact iﬀeach covering of X
by open sets contains a ﬁnite family of open subsets which already covers the space
X. For example, a subset of Rn, n = 1, 2, . . . is a compact topological space iﬀit is
closed and bounded (e.g., closed balls or spheres).
Connectedness. The topological space X is called arcwise connected iﬀfor
any two points x0, x1 in X there exists a continuous map
x : [0, 1] →X
such that x(0) = x0 and x(1) = x1. Intuitively, the continuous curve x = x(t) with
0 ≤t ≤1 connects the point x0 with the point x1. To each point x0 in X, there

240
5. A Glance at Topology
exists a maximal arcwise connected subset of X which contains the point x0. This
set is called the component of the point x0 in the topological space X. For example,
the component of the point x = 1 on the punctured real line R \ {0} is equal to the
interval ]0, ∞[.
By a loop in X, we understand a continuous map x : [0, 1] →X with the
property x(0) = x(1). The topological space X is called simply connected iﬀeach
loop in X can be continuously contracted into a point of X. Explicitly, there exists
a continuous map (t, s) →H(t, s),
H : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →X,
and a point x0 such that H(t, 0) = x(t) and H(t, 1) = x0 for all t ∈[0, 1]. The
unit circle S1 is not simply connected. Any disc in R2 is simply connected, but an
annulus is not simply connected (Fig. 5.12). The 2-dimensional sphere S2 is simply
connected, but a torus is not simply connected.
The Jordan curve theorem. A topological space is called a closed Jordan
curve iﬀit is homeomorphic to the unit circle S1. Obviously, the topological space
R2 \ S1
consists of two components, namely, the interior and the exterior of the unit circle.
In 1887 Camille Jordan (1838-1922) proved the much deeper result that for any
closed Jordan curve C living in R2, the topological space
R2 \ C
consists of two components; one component is bounded and the other component
is unbounded. These two components are called the interior and the exterior of the
curve C, respectively.11

Guillemin and Pollack (1974) on elementary diﬀerential topology, which empha-
sizes geometric intuition. We also refer to the beautiful modern textbook by Jost

5.6 Topological Quantum Numbers
In the 20th century, physicists learned that quantum phenomena in nature can be
classiﬁed by quantum numbers. There arises the question how to describe quan-
tum numbers in terms of mathematics. It turns out that there are two important
possibilities to obtain quantum numbers , namely,
(S) symmetry (the representation theory of compact Lie groups), and
(T) topology (topological invariants as topological charges or topological quantum
numbers).
In what follows, we will sketch some basic ideas by emphasizing the relations to
physical applications.
5.6.1 The Genus of a Surface
Classiﬁcation of real 1-dimensional manifolds. Let M be a real, 1-dimen-
sional, arcwise connected manifold.
• If M is compact, then it is diﬀeomorphic to the unit circle S1.
• If M is not compact, then it is diﬀeomorphic to the real line R.
The proof can be found in Milnor (1965) (appendix).
Classiﬁcation of real 2-dimensional manifolds. The following theorem was
one of the highlights of topology at the end of the 19th century:12
Each real, 2-dimensional, compact, oriented, arcwise connected manifold
is homeomorphic to a surface that is obtained by attaching a ﬁnite number
of handles to the 2-dimensional sphere S2.
The number of handles, g = 0, 1, 2, . . . , is called the genus of the manifold. For ex-
ample, the 2-dimensional sphere S2 has the genus g = 0. The torus is homeomorphic
to a sphere with one handle (Fig. 5.13(a)). Therefore, the genus of a torus is equal
to 1. Equivalently, the genus is the number of ‘holes’ (Fig. 5.13(b)). The genus is
a topological invariant. More precisely, two real, 2-dimensional, compact, oriented,
arcwise connected manifolds are homeomorphic iﬀthey have the same genus. This
means that the crucial qualitative structure of such manifolds only depends on the
genus of the manifold. Below we will illuminate this by considering
12 The proof of the more general result on the classiﬁcation of real, 2-dimensional,
oriented and non-orientable, compact, arcwise connected topological manifolds
can be found in W. Rinow, Topologie (in German), Sect. 50, Verlag der Wis-
senschaften, Berlin, 1975.
The complete proof was given ﬁrst by Dehn and Heegard in 1907 based on earlier
work by M¨obius, Riemann, Betti, Felix Klein, Poincar´e, and van Dyck in the 19th
century. We refer to E. Scholz, History of the Theory of Manifolds from Riemann
to Poincar´e (in German), Birkh¨auser, Basel, 1980.
The classiﬁcation of non-compact, real, 2-dimensional topological manifolds can
be found in B. von Ker´ekj´art´o, Vorlesungen ¨uber Topologie (Lectures on topol-
ogy) (in German), Springer, Berlin, 1923.

• the Poincar´e–Hopf index theorem on stationary points of dynamical systems,
• the Gauss–Bonnet theorem on the total curvature of surfaces, and
• the Morse theorem on critical points of energy functions on surfaces.
In addition, the crucial properties of Abelian integrals only depend on the genus g
of the Riemann surface of the corresponding algebraic function. In particular, the
number of additive periods of an Abelian integral is equal to 2g. In particular, the
Riemann surface of an elliptic integral is a torus with genus g = 1. This is respon-
sible for the fact that elliptic integrals possess two additive periods and the inverse
functions to elliptic integrals are double-periodic (i.e., they are elliptic functions).
5.6.2 The Euler Characteristic
We will decompose geometric objects into cells. This allows us to compute the Euler
characteristic as an alternating sum of the numbers of cells of increasing dimension.
Let us start with the following deﬁnitions.
• A 0-cell is a point.
• A 1-cell is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the open interval ]0, 1[.
• A 2-cell is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the open unit square
{(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 < x, y < 1}.
• For n = 1, 2, . . . , an n-cell is a topological space which is homeomorphic to the
open n-dimensional cube {x ∈Rn : 0 < x1, . . . , xn < 1}.
We deﬁne the Euler characteristic of the topological space X by
χ(X) := c0 −c1 + c2 −. . .
(5.5)
Here, c0, c1, . . . is the number of 0-cells, 1-cells, . . . , respectively. This deﬁnition
seems to depend on the decomposition of the space X into cells. The point is that
the Euler characteristic of X does not depend on the choice of the decomposition.
It turns out that the Euler characteristic of homotopically equivalent topo-
logical spaces is the same.
This is a deep result of modern topology.
Prototypes of the Euler characteristic χ. To get some feeling for the Euler
characteristic, let us consider a few simple examples.
(i) For a point, χ = c0 = 1.
(ii) Compact interval [a, b]. The interval [a, b] consists of the two boundary points
a, b and the open interval ]a, b[. Hence
χ = c0 −c1 = 2 −1 = 1.

(c)
χ = 6 −12 + 8 = 2
Fig. 5.15. Euler characteristic of a sphere
The point is that the Euler characteristic of [a, b] does not depend on the choice
of any decomposition of the interval. In fact, if we consider the decomposition
a < x1 < . . . < xn < b,
we have n + 2 points a, x1, . . . , b and n + 1 open intervals ]a, x1[, . . . , ]xn, b[.
Hence
χ = c0 −c1 = n + 2 −(n + 1) = 1.
(iii) Unit circle. For n = 2, 3, . . . , every decomposition of the unit sphere S1 consists
of n points and n 1-cells (Fig. 5.14). Hence
χ(S1) = c0 −c1 = n −n = 0.
(iv) 2-dimensional unit sphere. The sphere S2 can be decomposed into one point
(e.g., the North Pole) and the complement S2 \ {N} which is a 2-cell. Hence
χ(S2) = c0 −c1 + c2 = 1 −0 + 1 = 2.
Consider now a triangulation of S2 as pictured in Fig. 5.15(c). This triangula-
tion consists of six vertices, twelve 1-cells, and eight 2-cells. Hence
χ(S2) = c0 −c1 + c2 = 6 −12 + 8 = 2.
(v) Surface of a cube. By 5.15(b), there are eight vertices, twelve 1-cells, and six
2-cells. Hence
χ = c0 −c1 + c2 = 8 −12 + 6 = 2.
We expect this, since the surface of the cube is homeomorphic to the 2-
dimensional sphere. For the solid cube, we get
χ = c0 −c1 + c2 −c3 = 8 −12 + 6 −1 = 1.

The following are true.
• The Euler characteristic of a contractible space is equal to one.
• The Euler characteristic of a real, 2-dimensional, compact, oriented, arcwise con-
nected manifold of genus g = 0, 1, 2, . . . is equal to χ = 2 −2g. This generalizes
(iv). In particular, for the torus we have g = 1, and hence we get χ = 2 −2 = 0.
5.6.3 Platonic Solids and Fullerenes
In 387 B.C. Plato founded in Athens his Academy, which in most re-
spects was like a modern university. . . Though the main center shifted to
Alexandria around 300 B.C., the Academy remained preeminent in phi-
losophy throughout the Alexandrian period. It lasted nine hundred years
until it was closed by the Christian emperor Justinian in A.D. 529 be-
cause it taught “pagan and perverse learning”. . . Plato, one of the most
informed men of his day, was not a mathematician; but his enthusiasm
for the subject and his belief in its importance for philosophy and for the
understanding of the universe encouraged mathematicians to pursue it. It
is noteworthy that almost all of the important mathematical work of the
fourth century was done by Plato’s friends and pupils. Plato himself seems
to have been more concerned to improve and perfect what was known.
Morris Kline, 1972
Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times13
The Greeks were charmed by the fact that there exist precisely ﬁve regular polyhe-
dra called the Platonic solids: tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and
icosahedron (Fig. 5.16).
• The number of faces is equal to 4 (triangles), 6 (squares), 8 (triangles), 12 (pen-
tagons), 20 (triangles), respectively. These numbers are responsible for the des-
ignation of the Platonic solids.
• The number of vertices is equal to 4, 8, 6, 20, 12, respectively.
• The number of edges is equal to 6, 12, 12, 30, 30, respectively.
By deﬁnition, a regular polyhedron is a polyhedron whose faces all have the same
number of sides, and which also has the same number of faces meeting at each
vertex. It can be proven that the Platonic solids are the only regular polyhedra
homeomorphic to the 2-sphere. In 1750 Euler discovered that there holds
c0 −c1 + c2 = 2
13 Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press.

5.6 Topological Quantum Numbers
245
for the Platonic polyhedra. Here, c0 is the number of vertices, c1 is the number of
edges, and c2 is the number of faces. This formula follows from the fact that the
Euler characteristic of the 2-dimensional sphere is equal to 2, and the surfaces of
all the Platonic solids are homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional sphere. Felix Klein
wrote a beautiful book on the icosahedron14 and its symmetry group of order 60. He
used the symmetry group of the icosahedron in order to solve ﬁfth-order algebraic
equations by means of automorphic functions. If the polyhedron has g holes, then
χ = c0 −c1 + c2 = 2 −2g.
This was discovered by Simon l’Huilier in 1815. The number g is called the genus
of the polyhedron. In particular, for a torus-like polyhedron, we get g = 1.
In 1985, a new class of molecules was experimentally discovered. These molecules
of carbon have a roughly spherical shape. They are called fullerenes. For example,
the sixty carbon atoms of the C60-molecule form a polyhedron which has 60 vertices
and 32 faces (20 six-angles and 12 ﬁve-angles). By Euler’s polyhedron formula, the
number of edges is equal to
c1 = c0 + c2 −2 = 60 + 32 −2 = 90.
A soccer ball has the same shape. For the discovery of fullerenes, Sir Harold Kroto,
Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
These molecules are named after the American architect Robert Buckminster Fuller.
5.6.4 The Poincar´e–Hopf Theorem for Velocity Fields
We want to show that the topology of a manifold restricts the structure of velocity
vector ﬁelds on the manifold. Consider a velocity vector ﬁeld
v(x) = v(x, y)i + w(x, y)j
on the Euclidean plane. Suppose that v(x0) = 0 and that the stationary point x0
is regular, that is, we deﬁne
det v′(x0) :=
˛˛˛˛˛
vx(x0, y0) vy(x0, y0)
wx(x0, y0) wy(x0, y0)
˛˛˛˛˛ ,
and we assume that det v′(x0) ̸= 0. The number ind v(x0) := sgn det v′(x0) is
called the index of the stationary point x0. Some typical situations are pictured in
Fig. 5.17. For example, if
v(x, y) := λx,
w(x, y) := µy
with real nonzero numbers λ and µ, then ind v′(0) = sgn(λµ). In particular, the
index of a sink (or source) is equal to +1, whereas the index of a saddle is equal
to −1. Consider a smooth velocity vector ﬁeld on a real, 2-dimensional, compact,
arcwise connected manifold (e.g., a sphere) which has only a ﬁnite number of sta-
tionary points x1, ..., xN. In addition, suppose that all of the stationary points are
regular. Then, the Poincar´e–Hopf theorem tells us that

where χ is the Euler characteristic of the manifold.15 Let us consider some examples.
• The velocity ﬁeld pictured in Fig. 5.17(d) has one sink and one source, and the
Euler characteristic of a sphere is equal to 2.
• Since the Euler characteristic of a sphere is diﬀerent from zero, each smooth
velocity vector ﬁeld on a sphere has at least one stationary point (Poincar´e’s
hairy ball theorem).
• The velocity ﬁeld pictured in Fig. 5.17(e) has one source, one sink, and two
saddles, and the Euler characteristic of a torus is equal to zero.
Conversely, the Poincar´e–Hopf theorem can be used in order to compute the Euler
characteristic of a manifold easily. To this end, one has to construct a simple ﬂow
of ﬂuid particles on the manifold.
5.6.5 The Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Consider the triangle pictured in Fig. 5.18(a) on a sphere S2
R of radius R where the
sides are geodesics. For the sum of angles,
α + β + γ −F = π.
Here, F is the surface area of the triangle. Introducing the Gaussian curvature of
the sphere, K := 1/R2, we get the formula
15 The index refers to local coordinates. However, it turns out that this deﬁnition
is independent of the choice of local coordinates.

where χ(M) = 2 is the Euler characteristic (or the ﬁrst Chern number) of the

measure of the sphere. This Gauss–Bonnet formula is the prototype for a topological
quantum number. It tells us that a topological quantity – the Euler characteristic
– can be expressed by an analytical quantity – the Gaussian curvature. For a torus,
equation (5.18) is valid with K ≡0 and χ = 0.
The Gauss–Bonnet–Chern theorem. The Gauss–Bonnet theorem is one of
the most beautiful theorems in mathematics. In Volume IV on quantum mathe-
matics, we will consider far-reaching generalizations in the framework of the theory
of characteristic classes: the Gauss–Bonnet–Chern theorem for n-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifolds. In order to obtain such a generalization, one has to reformulate
the classical Gauss–Bonnet theorem in the modern language of vector bundles. At
this point, let us only sketch a few basic ideas.

us introduce spherical coordinates

following way:
x = R cos ϕ cos ϑ,
y = R sin ϕ cos ϑ,
z = R sin ϑ.
In fact, it follows from cos2 α + sin2 α = 1 that x2 + y2 + z2 = R2. Now consider a
smooth curve
C : ϕ = ϕ(t),
ϑ = ϑ(t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1
on the sphere. In Cartesian coordinates,
x(t) = R cos ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t),
y(t) = R sin ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t),
z(t) = R sin ϑ(t).
Diﬀerentiation with respect to time yields
˙x(t) = −R ˙ϕ(t) sin ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t) −R ˙ϑ(t) cos ϕ(t) sin ϑ(t).
Similarly, we get ˙y and ˙z. Using again cos2 α + sin2 α = 1,
˙s(t) :=
p
˙x2(t) + ˙y2(t) + ˙z2(t) = R
q
˙ϑ2(t) + ˙ϕ(t)2 cos2 ϑ(t).
This yields the arc length of the curve C,
s :=
Z t1
t0
˙s(t)dt =
Z t1

R
q
˙ϑ(t)2 + ˙ϕ(t)2 cos2 ϑ(t) dt.
Setting u1 := ϕ, u2 := ϑ, we get
˙s(t)2 = gij(u1(t), u2(t)) ˙ui(t) ˙uj(t)
where we sum over i, j = 1, 2. The functions
g11(ϕ, ϑ) := R2 cos2 ϑ(t),
g22(ϕ, ϑ) := R2,
g12 = g21 = 0
are called the components of the metric tensor of the sphere. Set g := det(gij). For
the sphere, g = g11g22 = R4 cos2 ϑ. The diﬀerential form
υ := √g dϕ ∧dϑ = R2 cos ϑ dϕ ∧dϑ
is called the volume form of the sphere S2
R. The integral

is equal to the surface area of the sphere.
In the 1820s, the importance of the metric tensor was ﬁrst noticed by Gauss in
the context of his surface theory. The theorema egregium (the beautiful theorem)
of Gauss tells us that the curvature of a surface can be computed by means of the
second partial derivatives of the functions gij (see Vol. III). In the 1850s, Riemann
introduced the components Rijkl of the Riemann curvature tensor for n-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds. In the special case of the sphere, there is only one essential
component of the Riemann curvature tensor, namely,
R1212 = Kg
where K = 1/R2 is the Gaussian curvature of the sphere S2
R. In 1915 Einstein crit-
ically used the Riemann curvature tensor of the 4-dimensional space-time manifold

in order to describe the gravitational force in our universe in the framework of the
theory of general relativity.
Velocity ﬁelds and the tangent bundle of the 2-dimensional sphere.
For each point x of the sphere S2
R, let TxS2
R denote the tangent space at x. In terms
of physics, this tangent space consists of all possible velocity vectors v at the point
x. In order to get a global object, let us introduce the tangent bundle TS2
R of the
sphere S2
R which consists of all possible pairs (x, v) where v is a velocity vector at
the point x. In other words,
TS2
R := {(x, v) : x ∈S2
R, v ∈TxS2
R}.
One can show that this is a real 4-dimensional manifold. It turns out that the
important geometric properties of the sphere like
• the parallel transport of velocity vectors and
• the curvature properties
can be formulated in terms of a connection on the tangent bundle. The basic idea
is to compute the curvature of the sphere at a point by measuring the parallel
transport of a velocity vector along a suﬃciently small loop around the point. This
concept is intrinsic, that is, it is independent of the surrounding space of the surface.
In order to best understand the geometry of the sphere S2
R, do not study
the sphere itself, but its tangent bundle TS2
R.
This strategy is crucial for modern diﬀerential geometry. Replacing the tangent
bundle by more general bundles, we get a mathematical approach to diﬀerential
geometry which is identical with gauge theory in physics. The two approaches were
created independently by mathematicians (Gauss, Riemann, Lie, Levi-Civita, ´Elie
Cartan, Ehresmann) and physicists (Yang, Mills) and completed in the 1950s.16 In
particular, the Standard Model in particle physics can be described this way. This
will be studied in great detail in Volume III on gauge theory. We will see that
• connection (resp. curvature) in mathematics
• corresponds to potential (resp. interacting force) in physics.
The ﬁrst Chern class of the tangent bundle of the sphere. By deﬁnition,
the diﬀerential form
ω = K
2π · υ
is a representative of the ﬁrst Chern class c1(S2
R) of the tangent bundle TS2
R. The
Gauss–Bonnet theorem (5.8) can equivalently be written as
Z
S2
R
ω = χ(S2
R).
As we will show in Volume IV, the ﬁrst Chern class is an element of the second de
Rham cohomology group H2(S2
R) of the sphere S2
R. In 1945 Chern discovered how
to generalize this to higher dimensions.17

5.6.6 The Morse Theorem on Critical Points of Energy Functions
The Morse index of an energy function. Suppose that the smooth real function
E : R →R has a regular critical point at x0, that is, E′(x0) = 0 and E′′(x0) ̸= 0.
Then, the Morse index of x0 is given by
i(x0) :=
(
0
if
E′′(x0) > 0,
1
if
E′′(x0) < 0.
This corresponds to a minimum (resp. maximum) of E at the point x0 (Fig. 5.19).
More generally, consider a smooth real function E : R2 →R. Then
E′(x, y) := (Ex(x, y), Ey(x, y)),
E′′(x, y) :=
 
Exx(x, y) Exy(x, y)
Exy(x, y) Eyy(x, y)
!
.
Let (x0, y0) be a regular critical point of E, that is, E′(x0, y0) = 0 and
det E′′(x0, y0) ̸= 0.
Then the Morse index i(x0, y0) of (x0, y0) is deﬁned to be the number of negative
eigenvalues of the matrix E′′(x0, y0). For example, the function
f(x, y) := λx2 + µy2
with the real nonzero numbers λ and µ has the origin (0, 0) as regular critical point
with the Morse index
i(0, 0) :=

<

:
0
if
λ > 0, µ > 0,
1
if
λµ < 0,
2
if
λ < 0, µ < 0.
This corresponds to a minimum (resp. saddle point, maximum) of the function E
at the point (0, 0).
The Morse theorem. Let E : M →R be a smooth function on the real,
2-dimensional, compact, oriented, arcwise connected manifold M of genus g (e.g., a
sphere or a torus). Suppose that the function E has only a ﬁnite number of critical

points, and all of them are regular. Let mi be the number of critical points of E
with Morse index i.18 Then
m0 −m1 + m2 = χ(M).
In addition, we have the famous Morse inequalities19
m0 ≥β0,
m1 ≥β1,
m2 ≥β2.
The lower bounds β0 := 1, β1 := 2g, β2 := 1 are the so-called Betti numbers of the
manifold M. For the Euler characteristic of the manifold M, we get
χ(M) = β0 −β1 + β2 = 2 −2g.
In particular, for a torus M, g = 1.20 Thus, on a torus, the function E has at least
one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points. In addition, from χ = 0 we
get m0 + m2 = m1, that is, the number of minima plus the number of maxima of
E is equal to the number of saddle points.
For example, consider the function z = h(x, y) on the torus where h(x, y) de-
notes the height of the point (x, y) (Fig. 5.19(c)). The function h has a mini-
mum (resp. maximum) at the point A (resp. D) with Morse index iA = 0 (resp.
iD = 2). Furthermore, the function h has saddles at the points B, C with Morse
index iB = iC = 1. For the Euler characteristic of the torus, we get
χ = m0 −m1 + m2 = 1 −2 + 1 = 0.

diﬀerent loops (also called fundamental 1-cycles) which cannot be continuously
deformed into each other. For example, think of the equator and some meridian.

5. A Glance at Topology
Of the geometria situs, which Leibniz (1646–1716) sensed, and of which
only a few geometers, Euler (1707–1783) and Vandermonde (1735–1796),
were granted an obscured view, we know and have, after a hundred and
ﬁfty years, still little more than nothing.
Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1833
It was the discovery by Gauss of this very integral expressing the work
done on a magnetic pole while describing a closed curve in presence of a
closed electric current and indicating the geometric connection between the
two closed curves, that led him to lament the small progress made in the
Geometry of Position since the time of Leibniz, Euler and Vandermonde.
We now have some progress to report, chieﬂy due to Riemann, Helmholtz
and Listing.
James Clerk Maxwell, 1873
A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism
In obtaining a topological invariant by using a physical ﬁeld theory, Gauss
had anticipated Topological Field Theory by almost 150 years. Even the
term topology was not used then. It was introduced by Johann Listing
(1806-1882), a student and proteg´e of Gauss, in his 1847 essay Preliminary
Studies on Topology. Gauss’ linking number formula can also be interpreted
as the equality of topological and analytical degree of a suitable function.
Starting with this a far-reaching generalization of the Gauss integral to
higher linking self-linking integrals can be obtained. This forms a small
part of a program initiated by Maxim Kontsevich to relate topology of
low-dimensional manifolds, homotopical algebras, and non-commutative
geometry with topological ﬁeld theories and Feynman diagrams in physics.

Historically, the Biot–Savart law was discovered in 1820. In the 1830s in
G¨ottingen, Gauss (1777–1855) experimentally studied the magnetic ﬁeld of the
earth with Wilhelm Weber (1804–1891). After Gauss’ death, the fragment of a 1833
note was found. In this note entitled “On Electrodynamics”, Gauss introduced his
linking integral. 22
5.6.8 Electric Fields, the Kronecker Integral, and the Mapping
Degree
Electric Fields. Parallel to the Biot–Savart law for magnetic ﬁelds and Gauss’
linking integral, let us now use the electric Coulomb ﬁeld in order to give the
Kronecker degree integral a physical motivation. In what follows, we will use the
elegant language of diﬀerential forms which generalizes the classical Newton–Leibniz
calculus to functions of several variables in a natural way. This calculus is basic
for modern physics and mathematics. We will thoroughly study this in Volume
III. As an introduction to diﬀerential forms and their applications to physics, we
recommend the author’s handbook Zeidler (2002a), Vols. 1, 2.
The localization principle. Let x1, . . . , xN be points in the interior of a closed
3-dimensional ball B. For j = 1, . . . , N, choose a small closed ball Bj centered at the
point xj such that Bj lies in the interior of B, and B1, . . . , BN are pairwise disjoint

In addition, we assume that the spheres ∂B and ∂B1, . . . , ∂BN are oriented in such

5.6.9 The Heat Kernel and the Atiyah–Singer Index Theorem
Like others, we came to the heat kernel via one direction of mathemat-
ics. However, as we progressed in that direction, we realized that the heat
kernel plays a central role in almost all directions we can think of. That
it bears a name related to physics only indicates that it was originally
discovered in direction with heat.25 But even in physics, its signiﬁcance
goes way beyond the giving a mathematical model for heat distribution.
The name cannot be changed – it’s too late for that – but the impression
some people may have that an occurrence of a certain kernel called the
heat kernel means one is necessarily doing physics is a false impression.
Maybe one is and maybe one isn’t. . . There is a universal gadget which is
a dominant factor practically everywhere in mathematics, also in physics,
and has very simple and powerful properties. We have no a priori explana-
tion (psychological, philosophical, mathematical) for the phenomenon of
the existence of such a universal gadget.
Jay Jorgenson and Serge Lang, 2001
The Ubiquitous Heat Kernel26
To explain the basic ideas of the far-reaching heat kernel approach to mathematics,
let us study the most simple example, namely, heat conduction on the unit circle.
To this end, let C∞(S1) denote the space of smooth complex-valued functions
f : S1 →C
on the unit circle S1. Alternatively, these functions can be regarded as smooth
functions f = f(ϕ) on the real line of period 2π, with respect to the angle ϕ. In
this case, we have the convergent Fourier series expansion
f(ϕ) =
∞

(5.13)
for all ϕ ∈R where an(f) :=

R π
−π f(ϕ)e−inϕ dϕ. We are given the function
g ∈C∞(S1). Let us ﬁrst study the following diﬀerential equation on the unit circle,
Df = g,
f ∈C∞(S1),
(5.14)
with the diﬀerential operator D := −i d
dϕ. We want to show that
ind D = χ(S1) = 0.
(5.15)
This tells us that an analytic quantity – the index of the diﬀerential operator D on
the unit circle S1 – equals a topological quantity – the Euler characteristic χ(S1) of
the unit circle.27

The classical Fourier method. Let us prove (5.15). Using Fourier series
expansion, it follows from
g(ϕ) = a0(g) + a1(g)eiϕ + a−1(g)e−iϕ + ...
and f ′(ϕ) = ia1(f)eiϕ −ia−1(f)e−iϕ + ... that the original problem (5.14) has a
solution iﬀa0(g) = 0. In other words, we have the solvability condition
Z π

g(ϕ)dϕ = 0.
The solution f is then given by (5.13) where
a0(f) = const,
an(f) = −an(g)
n
,
n = ±1, ±2, ...
By deﬁnition, the index of the equation (5.14) reads as
ind D := d −s
where d is the dimension of the solution space, and s is the number of linearly
independent solvability conditions. Since d = 1 and s = 1, ind D = 0. This proves
the claim.
The heat equation on the unit circle. Let us pass from the operator D to
the Laplacian ∆:= D2 on the unit circle. Explicitly,
∆= −d2
dϕ2 .
Following Fourier, we want to study the initial-value problem for the unit circle,
∂T(ϕ, t)
∂ϕ
= −D2T (ϕ, t),
ϕ ∈[−π, π], t > 0,
T(ϕ, 0) = T0(ϕ).
(5.16)
This equation describes the propagation of heat on the unit circle (e.g., heat con-
duction within a thin wire). Here, T denotes temperature. Alternatively, this can
be viewed as the propagation of heat on the real line where the temperature T
has the period 2π with respect to the position coordinate ϕ ∈R. We are given the
initial temperature T0 ∈C∞(S1) at the initial time t = 0. By using the classical
Fourier method, our goal is to describe the unique solution of (5.16) by the integral
formula
T(ϕ, t) =

In terms of Feynman’s approach to physics, the heat kernel is identical to
the Feynman propagator kernel for the heat equation.
Let us introduce the complex Hilbert space L2(S1) of all measurable functions
f : R →C of period 2π with the inner product
⟨f|h⟩:=

f(ϕ)†h(ϕ)dϕ.
The functions f0, f1, ... form a complete orthonormal system in the Hilbert space

determine the temperature distribution in the past.
Theorem 5.1 The initial-value problem (5.16) for heat conduction on the unit

The language of the Dirac calculus. For the convenience of the reader, we
want to reformulate the classical Fourier method above in terms of the elegant Dirac
calculus. We restrict ourselves to formal arguments. To begin with, let us denote
the function fk by |k⟩. Moreover, we set fk(ϕ) := ⟨ϕ|k⟩. We have the orthogonality
conditions
⟨k|l⟩= δkl,
k, l = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
and the two completeness relations

equations can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, Chap. 7.

Now to the point. Introducing the Feynman propagator P+(t) := θ(t)e−D2t for all
t ∈R, the solution of the initial-value problem (5.16) reads as
T (t) = P+(t)T0,
t ≥0.
Let us motivate this in a formal way. By the completeness relation,
⟨ϕ|T (t)⟩=
Z π

dψ⟨ϕ|P+(t)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|T0⟩.
Since D|k⟩= k|k⟩, we get the crucial eigensolutions

of the Feynman propagator. Introducing the Feynman propagator kernel
P+(ϕ, ψ, t) := ⟨ϕ|P+(t)|ψ⟩,
t ≥0,
the completeness relation yields

The zeta function of a compact manifold. Before continuing the study of
the heat equation on the unit circle, let us embed this problem into the general
context of real d-dimensional compact manifolds M.29 On such a manifold, the
Laplacian ∆has a countable set of eigenvalues 0 ≤λ0 < λ1 < ... which possesses
the following famous Weyl asymptotics

are investigated in Kirsten (2002).
30 Hermann Weyl’s ﬁrst investigations on (5.18) from 1911 were motivated by
Planck’s radiation law. In modern language, Weyl wanted to prove that the
properties of a photon gas in a box do not depend on the shape of the box, but
only on the volume.

This zeta function is closely related to the Dirichlet series
KM(t) :=

which is called the global heat kernel of the manifold M. Letting τ :=

KM(t) = c−d
τ d + c−d+1
τ d−1 + ... + c−1
τ

τ →+0.
The coeﬃcients c−d, c−d+1, ... are called heat kernel coeﬃcients. The normalized
Mellin transform of the heat kernel yields the zeta function,
ζM(s) =

along with the relations
c−d+k = Γ(s)Res ζM(s)|s=(d−k)/2,

In particular, the zeta function ζM is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the ori-
gin s = 0. In order to compute Feynman functional integrals, physicists need the
product

called the determinant of ∆(see page 658). Obviously, the derivative ζ′
M(0) is equal

The heat kernel method for computing the index. One of the deepest
results of modern mathematics is the 1963 Atiyah–Singer index theorem. This the-
orem generalizes the Riemann–Roch theorem for Riemann surfaces; it tells us that
the index of each elliptic operator (e.g., the Laplacian) on a compact manifold M
is a topological invariant of the manifold and can be computed by means of the
heat kernel coeﬃcients. In particular, the index does not change if both the mani-
fold and the diﬀerential operator are perturbed in a reasonable manner. Thus, the
Atiyah–Singer index theorem tells us that
There exists a deep relation between the topology (i.e., the qualitative be-
havior) of a manifold and the structure of analytic objects on the manifold.
This index theorem also applies to pseudo-diﬀerential operators including large
classes of diﬀerential and integral equations. The Atiyah–Singer theorem will be
studied in Volume IV; it is a crucial ingredient of quantum mathematics. Interest-
ingly enough, there exists a rigorous supersymmetric proof of the Atiyah–Singer

index theorem which was motivated by physical mathematics. This proof can be
found in Cycon et al. (1986). See also Berline, Getzler, and Vergne (1991).
At this point, let us consider the special case of the Atiyah–Singer theorem for
the operator D on the 1-dimensional unit circle S1 with d = 1. The eigenvalues of
the Laplacian ∆are given by
λn = n2,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
This corresponds to the Weyl asymptotics (5.18) where V = 2π denotes the volume
of the unit circle. This yields the zeta function

Hence ind D = 0, as obtained above in an explicit way.
there exists an orientation preserving diﬀeomorphism
F : f(S1) →R3
which maps the set f(S1) onto g(S1). The knot is called an unknot iﬀit is equivalent
to the unit circle.
By deﬁnition, a link is a ﬁnite collection of pairwise disjoint knots. Note that
knots are special links. Graphically, links are represented by projections onto a ﬁxed
plane with crossings marked as over and under (Fig. 5.23). There exists a complete
classiﬁcation of all knots having at most 16 crossing points. This list consists of
1, 701, 936 knots.31 Two links are called equivalent iﬀthey consist of equivalent
knots.

et al. (1998).

The main task of knot theory is to decide whether two knots or links are
equivalent.
For example, one wants to know whether a given knot is trivial, that is, it is equiv-
alent to the unknot. To this end, one introduces link
5.6.10 Knots and Topological Quantum Field Theory
In the last twenty years a body of mathematics has evolved with strong
direct input from theoretical physics, for example from classical and quan-
tum ﬁeld theories, statistical mechanics and string theory. In particular,
in the geometry and topology of low dimensional manifolds (i.e., mani-
folds of dimensions 2, 3 and 4) we have seen new results, some of them
quite surprising, as well as new ways of looking at old results. Donaldson’s
work based on his study of the solution space of the Yang–Mills equations,
monopole equations of Seiberg–Witten, Floer homology, quantum groups
and topological quantum ﬁeld theoretical interpretation of the Jones poly-
nomial and other knot invariants are some of the examples of this devel-
opment. Donaldson, Jones and Witten have received the Fields medal for
their work. We think the name “Physical Mathematics” is appropriate to
describe this new, exciting and fast growing area of mathematics. Recent
developments in knot theory make it an important chapter in “Physical
Mathematics.” Until the early 1980s it was an area in the backwaters of
topology. Now it is a very active area of research with its own journal.32
Kishore Marathe, 2001
A chapter in physical mathematics: theory of knots in the sciences
Intuitively, a knot is a closed curve in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space without
self-intersections; two knots are called equivalent iﬀthey can be deformed into each
other in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space, by avoiding self-intersections during the
deformation process. More precisely, by deﬁnition, a knot is a smooth embedding
f : S1 →R3
of the unit circle S1 into R3, that is, the image f(S1) of the smooth map f is a
submanifold of R3, and the induced map
f : S1 →f(S1)
is a diﬀeomorphism.33 Two knots f, g : S1 →R3 are called equivalent (or ambient
isotopic) iﬀ
invariants which possess the characteristic property that equivalent links have
the same link invariant. A crucial link invariant is the Jones polynomial
J(t) :=
n
X
k=−n
aktk/2
generated by t1/2 and t−1/2 with integer coeﬃcients ak, n = 0, 1, 2, .... The Jones
polynomials have the following properties:
(J1) Two oriented equivalent links have the same Jones polynomial.

Fig. 5.24. Crossing points
(J2) For the unknot, J(t) :≡1.
(J3) If the projective link diagrams of three links diﬀer exactly at one distinguished
crossing point, then the corresponding Jones polynomials satisfy the following
skein relation
t−1J+(t) −tJ−(t) = (t1/2 −t−1/2)J0(t)
where the Jones polynomials J+, J−, J0 correspond to the behavior of the link
diagrams L+, L−, L0, respectively, at the distinguished crossing point (Fig.
5.24).
(J4) For the mirror image of a link, the Jones polynomial is transformed by t →t−1.
For a given link, the idea of computing the Jones polynomial is to successively
change the link diagram at crossing points according to Fig. 5.24 in order to ﬁnally
obtain the unknot. The corresponding skein relations then yield recursive formulas
for the desired Jones polynomial. In particular, for the links L+, L−, L0 pictured in
Fig. 5.23, the skein relation with J± = 1 by (J2) yields
t−1 −t = (t1/2 −t−1/2)J0(t).
Hence the Jones polynomial J0 of the link L0 in Fig. 5.23(c) is equal to
J0(t) = −t1/2 −t−1/2.
Considering Fig. 5.23, the link L+ (resp. L−) is not equivalent to the link L0, since
the corresponding Jones polynomial J± = 1 is diﬀerent from J0.
The Jones polynomials were discovered by Jones in 1985 when studying the
structure of von Neumann operator algebras.34 A few years later, Witten (1989)
published a fundamental paper on a beautiful physical interpretation of the Jones
polynomials via a special model in quantum ﬁeld theory. The idea is to use
• the principle of critical action for the Chern–Simons Lagrangian on the 3-
dimensional sphere S3 with respect to the gauge group SU(2);
• quantization of this classical ﬁeld theory yields the corresponding Feynman func-
tional integral, as a formal partition function;
• to each knot on S3 one can assign a physical quantity called the Wilson loop;
• ﬁnally, the Jones polynomial of a knot or link is the vacuum expectation value
of the corresponding Wilson loop.
Roughly speaking, the Chern–Simons Lagrangians represent quite natural gauge
ﬁeld theories on 3-dimensional manifolds.
Topological quantum ﬁeld theory. This new branch of topology was
founded by E. Witten, Topological quantum ﬁeld theory, Commun. Math. Phys.
117 (1988), 353–386. The basic idea of topological quantum ﬁeld theory is to use
the Lagrangians of special gauge ﬁeld theories and the corresponding Feynman

functional integrals in order to construct sophisticated topological invariants for
low-dimensional manifolds. As an introduction to modern knot theory and its rela-
tions to physics, chemistry, and biology (DNA), we recommend the survey article
by Marathe (2001) and the monographs by Kaufman (2001) and Flappan (2000)
(molecular chirality in chemistry). For topological quantum ﬁeld theory, see the lec-
tures given by Atiyah (1990b) and Witten (1999c). We also refer to the monograph
by Jost (2002a) (geometric analysis and classical models in quantum ﬁeld theory).
For a wealth of material on the relation between topological charges and non-
linear partial diﬀerential equations arising in modern physics, we recommend the
monographs by Felsager (1997), Naber (1997), and Yang (2001).
5.7 Quantum States
In the next sections we want to show that the study of quantum states is closely
related to crucial topological concepts. We will consider
• the covering group of the rotation group and the electron spin,
• the space of spin states of an electron with the Hopf ﬁbration of the 3-dimensional
sphere (the U(1)-Hopf bundle), and
• the relation between the space of spin states, Grassmann manifolds, and projec-
tive geometry.
5.7.1 The Topological Character of the Electron Spin
Our 3-dimensional intuition sees rotations, but not the corresponding uni-
versal covering group Spin(3) which lives on the 4-dimensional unit sphere.
Nature sees this in terms of the electron spin.
Folklore
Let us sketch why the electron spin is a topological eﬀect.
The point is that the rotation group SO(3) of the 3-dimensional Euclidean
space of our intuition is not simply connected, whereas the multiplicative
group Spin(3) of unit quaternions is simply connected.
Let us start with the famous Cayley rotation formula35
x′ = QxQ†
(5.20)
where we use the following quaternions
Q := cos θ
2 + n sin θ
2,
Q† := cos θ
2 −n sin θ
2.
Formula (5.20) describes the rotation of the position vector x about an axis given
by the unit vector n and the rotation angle θ ∈[0, 2π[. Here, we use Hamilton’s
quaternions. A quaternion (α, a) is an ordered pair of a real number α and an vector
a in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We brieﬂy write α + a. The sum and the
product of two quaternions are deﬁned by
(α + a) + (β + b) = (α + β) + (a + b)
35 Hamilton (1805–1865), Cayley (1821–1895).

266
5. A Glance at Topology
and
(α + a)(β + b) = αβ + αb + βa + a × b −ab.
If we replace Q by −Q, then we get the same rotated vector x′. This corresponds to
a passage from n to −n and from θ to 2π−θ. Consequently, there are two additional
degrees of freedom hidden in the Cayley formula (5.20).
Nature sees these hidden degrees of freedom in terms of the electron spin.
Let us discuss this. The length of a quaternion is deﬁned by
||α + a|| :=
p
α2 + a2.
In particular, ||Q|| =
q
cos2 θ
2 + sin2 θ
2 n2 = 1. The set of all unit quaternions Q
forms a multiplicative group called the spin group Spin(3). The Cayley formula
(5.20) describes a group epimorphism
χ : Spin(3) →SO(3)
(5.21)
from the spin group Spin(3) onto the group SO(3) of rotations SO(3) in three-
dimensional space, that is, the surjective map χ respects products.
The group SO(3) is not simply connected, but the group Spin(3), which corre-
sponds to the 4-dimensional unit sphere, is simply connected. We call Spin(3) the
universal covering group of the group SO(3). Let us now study this in terms of Lie
groups and Lie algebras.
(i) The Lie group U(1) of rotations in the plane consists of all complex numbers A
with |A| = 1 Hence A = eiθ with real parameter θ. For all the complex numbers
z = x + yi, the transformation
z′ = eiθz
describes a rotation in the plane about the origin with rotation angle θ. Set
ϱ(θ) := eiθ. The map
ϱ : R →U(1)
is a group epimorphism from the additive group R onto the multiplicative group
U(1). Explicitly,
ϱ(θ + ϕ) = ϱ(θ)ϱ(ϕ)
for all
θ, ϕ ∈R.
The unit circle U(1) is not simply connected, whereas the real line R is simply
connected. The additive group R is called the universal covering group of U(1).
(ii) The Lie algebra u(1). By Taylor expansion,
eiθ = 1 + iθ + o(θ),
θ →0.
The set u(1) := {iθ :
θ ∈R} is called the Lie algebra to U(1).
(iii) The Lie group SO(3). Choose a right-handed Cartesian (x, y, z)-system in the
Euclidean space of our intuition. All possible rotations about the origin can be
described by the matrix transformations

where the real (3 × 3)-matrix has the properties det A = 1 and A−1 = Ad. All
of these matrices form the group SO(3).36
(iv) The Lie algebra so(3) of the group SO(3) consists of all real (3 × 3)-matrices
B with B = −Bd. The set so(3) is a real 3-dimensional linear space equipped
with the Lie product
[B, C]−:= BC −CB.
That is, B, C ∈so(3) implies [B, C]−∈so(3). The matrices in so(3) are called
inﬁnitesimal rotations. Set
ϱ(B) := eB.
The map ϱ : so(3) →SO(3) is surjective. In other words, each given matrix
A ∈SO(3) can be represented in the form A = eB with B ∈so(3). The relation
between the commutator of SO(3) and the Lie product of the corresponding
Lie algebra so(3) is given by
[A, B]−=
∂2
∂t∂s
“
etAesBe−tAe−sB”
|t,s=0
where t and s are real parameters.
(v) The Lie group SU(n), n ≥2 consists of all the complex (n × n)-matrices A
with det A = 1 and A−1 = A†.
(vi) The Lie algebra su(n) of the Lie group SU(n) consists of all the complex
(n × n)-matrices B with B† = −B and tr B = 0. If B, C ∈su(n), then we have
[B, C]−∈su(n). Set
ϱ(B) := eB.
The map ϱ : su(n) →SU(n) is surjective. The group SU(n) is simply connected
for n = 2, 3, . . . .
The group SU(2) is isomorphic to the group Spin(3), that is, there ex-
ists a bijective map from SU(2) onto Spin(3) which respects products.
The map (5.21) induces the group epimorphism
χ : SU(2) →SO(3).
The linearization of this map at the unit element,
χ′(I) : su(2) →so(3),
is a Lie algebra isomorphism, that is, χ′(I) is a linear isomorphism which
respects Lie products.37
(vii) Representations of SO(3) and integer angular momentum. For each natural
number l = 0, 1, 2, . . ., there exist both a complex Hilbert space Xl of dimension
2l + 1 and a group morphism
r : SO(3) →GL(Xl),
that is, the map r respects products. Here, GL(Xl) denotes the group of all
linear isomorphisms from Xl onto itself. The linearization at the unit element
r′(I) : so(3) →gl(Xl)
36 The symbol Ad = (bjk) denotes the dual (or transposed) matrix to the given
matrix A = (ajk). Explicitly, bjk := akj for j, k = 1, 2, 3. Instead of Ad, one also
uses the symbols AT , At, or tA in the literature.
37 The deﬁnition of the derivative χ′(I) can be found in Sect. 7.20.1 on page 396.

268
5. A Glance at Topology
is a Lie algebra morphism, that is, r′(I) is a linear operator which respects Lie
products. Here, gl(Xl) consists of all linear operators on Xl equipped with the
Lie product [A, B]−:= AB −BA.
(ix) Representations of SU(2) and half-integer spin. For each given rational number
s = 0, 1
2, 1, 3
2, 2, . . . , there exist both a complex Hilbert space Xs of dimension
2s + 1 and a group morphism
r : SU(2) →GL(Xs)
such that the linearization at the unit element,
r′(I) : su(2) →gl(Xs),
is a Lie algebra morphism. The elements of Xl (resp. Xs) represent quantum
states with the angular momentum quantum number l (resp. the spin quantum
number s.)
Summarizing, the Lie group SO(3) and its universal covering group
SU(2) are locally isomorphic near the unit element, but they are not
globally isomorphic.
This leads to diﬀerent representations of the groups SO(3) and SU(2) which
is responsible for the existence of the electron spin. The Lie algebras so(3) and
su(2) are isomorphic. Therefore, the operators for both angular momentum
and spin satisfy the same commutation rules in quantum physics. This will be
studied in Volume III on quantum mathematics.
5.7.2 The Hopf Fibration of the 3-Dimensional Sphere
The space of quantum states of a quantum system possesses a nontrivial
topology.
Folklore
In 1931, Heinz Hopf (1894–1971) proved the existence of a continuous map
h : S3 →S2
(5.22)
from the 3-dimensional unit sphere onto the 2-dimensional unit sphere which is not
homotopic to a constant map, that is, this map cannot be continuously deformed
into a constant map without leaving the spheres during the deformation process.38
This was a sensation in topology. The map h is called the Hopf map or the Hopf
U(1)-principal ﬁber bundle. Hopf did not refer to physics. We want to show that
the Hopf map possesses a quite natural physical interpretation in terms of the clas-
siﬁcation of quantum states of a non-relativistic electron. There arises the following
fundamental question:
What is a quantum state?
38 For n = 1, 2, ..., we deﬁne
Sn := {(x1, ..., xn+1) ∈Rn+1 : x2
1 + ... + x2
n+1 = 1}.
This is called the n-dimensional unit sphere in Rn+1. Moreover, the set
Bn+1 := {(x1, ..., xn+1) ∈Rn+1 : x2
1 + ... + x2
n+1 ≤1}
is called the (n + 1)-dimensional closed unit ball in Rn+1.

5.7 Quantum States
269
To answer this question, we will consider non-relativistic electrons. We will see that
quantum states are highly nonlinear mathematical objects.
Quantum states. Let C2 denote the linear space of all the complex 1-column
matrices
ψ =
 
ψ1
ψ2
!
where ψ1, ψ2 are complex numbers. We also introduce the inner product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
2
X
j=1
ψ†
jϕj
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈C2
along with the norm ||ψ|| :=
p
⟨ψ|ψ⟩. Consider the unit sphere
S(C2) := {ψ ∈C2 : ||ψ|| = 1}
of the complex 2-dimensional Hilbert space C2. By deﬁnition, each element ψ of
S(C2) is called the state of a non-relativistic electron. Writing ψj = αj + iβj with
real numbers αj, βj, we get
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2 = α2
1 + β2
1 + α2
2 + β2
2 = 1
for all ψ ∈S(C2). Hence S(C2) can be identiﬁed with the unit sphere,
S(C2) = S3.
Two states ϕ, ψ ∈S(C2) are called equivalent iﬀthere exists a complex number
λ ∈U(1) (i.e., |λ| = 1) such that ϕ = λψ. By a quantum state of the electron, we
understand the equivalence class
[ψ] := {λψ : λ ∈U(1)}
(5.23)
where ψ ∈S(C2) and |λ| = 1. We have the ﬁbration
S(C2) =
[
ψ∈S(C2)
[ψ],
that is, the sphere is decomposed into the sets [ψ] which are called U(1)-ﬁbers in
mathematics. Consequently, the set of all quantum states coincides with the set of
all U(1)-ﬁbers of the unit sphere S(C2). This set is denoted by
S(C2)/U(1).
In terms of orbits, this deﬁnition reads like this. Choose a point ψ ∈S(C2). For
each complex number λ ∈U(1), deﬁne a map
ϱλ : S(C2) →S(C2)
given by ϱλ(ψ) := λψ. We say that the group U(1) acts on the unit sphere S(C2).
Naturally enough, the set [ψ] from (5.23) is called an orbit through the point ψ. In
this setting, the space of quantum states coincides with the space of U(1)-orbits on
the unit sphere of the Hilbert space C2.

5. A Glance at Topology
The Hopf map. Our next goal is to understand the topological structure of
the space S(C2)/U(1) of quantum states. To this end, we choose the Pauli matrices
σ1 :=
 
0 1

,
σ2 :=
 
0 −i
i
0
!
,
σ3 :=

and we deﬁne the spin operators Sj := ℏ
2 σj, j = 1, 2, 3. For each state ψ ∈S(C2),
we deﬁne
¯Sj := ⟨ψ|Sjψ⟩,
j = 1, 2, 3.
Choose a Cartesian coordinate system with the right-handed orthonormal basis
vectors i, j, k. From the physical point of view, if the electron is in the state ψ, then
we measure the mean spin vector ¯S := ¯S1i + ¯S2j + ¯S3k. We now construct a map
h : S(C2) →S2
(5.24)
by setting
h(ψ) :=
¯S(ψ)
||¯S(ψ)||.
That is, we assign the measured normalized mean spin vector to each given state
ψ ∈S2(C2). This measured value does not change if we pass to an equivalent state
ϕ. Thus, the function h only depends on the equivalence class [ψ]. Setting
h([ψ]) :=
¯S(ψ)
||¯S(ψ)||,
we obtain a well-deﬁned induced map
h : S(C2)/U(1) →S2.
(5.25)
Now to the point. We claim that the following hold true.
Theorem 5.2 (i) The map h introduced in (5.24) is a continuous map from the unit
sphere S(C2) of the 2-dimensional complex Hilbert space C2 onto the 2-dimensional
unit sphere S2 of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.
(ii) The map h is essential, that is, it is not homotopic to a constant map.
(iii) There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the space of quantum
states S(C2)/U(1) and the 2-dimensional unit sphere which is given by the induced
map h from (5.25).
The proof will be given in Volume IV on quantum mathematics (see also Kn¨orrer
(1996)). In terms of physics, this result tells us that
Two normalized vectors ψ and χ represent the same quantum state iﬀthe
measured normalized spin vectors coincide.
This is a quite natural result. Using (5.24) and S2(C2) = S3, we get the desired
Hopf map (5.22).

5.7.3 The Homotopy Functor
Functors reduce the solution of topological problems to simpler algebraic
problems.
Folklore
The homotopy groups of a topological space. We are going to sketch how the
Hopf map is related to the classiﬁcation of continuous maps up to deformations.
Let X be a topological space. Consider the continuous map
f : Sk →X,
k = 1, 2, . . . .
(5.26)
By deﬁnition, the homotopy class [f] of the map f consists of all continuous maps
g : Sk →X that are homotopic to f. The symbol πk(X) denotes the set of all
homotopy classes [f] of maps of the form (5.26).
The set πk(X) can be equipped with the structure of a group.
This yields the kth homotopy group πk(X) of the topological space X. In particular,
the group π1(X) is Poincar´e’s fundamental group. Note the following.
(i) The topological space X is simply connected iﬀπ1(X) = 0.
(ii) If πk(X) = 0, then each continuous map f : Sk →X is homotopic to a constant
map. In this case, we say that the k-connectivity of the space X is trivial.
(iii) If πk(X) = Z, then it is possible to assign an integer to each continuous map
f : Sk →X which is called the mapping degree deg(f). Two continuous maps
f, g : Sk →X
have the same mapping degree iﬀthey are homotopic. In other words, the
mapping degree is a homotopy invariant.
(iv) Homotopically equivalent topological spaces have the same homotopy groups.
Let us consider the following examples.
• For the unit circle, π1(S1) = Z and πk(S1) = 0, k = 2, 3, . . . The mapping degree
of f : S1 →S1 is called the winding number.
• For the fundamental group of the 2-dimensional torus, π1(X) = Z ⊕Z.
• For the 2-dimensional unit sphere,
π1(S2) = 0,
π2(S2) = π3(S2) = Z.
• For the k-dimensional unit sphere with k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , we get πk(Sk) = Z.
The complete computation of all the homotopy groups of the spheres of arbitrary
dimension is an open problem in topology.39
The mapping degree for smooth mappings. Let k = 1, 2, . . . For a smooth
map f : Sk →Sk, the mapping degree deg(f) is given by the Kronecker integral
deg(f) =
Z
Sk f ∗υ
where υ denotes the volume form on Sk normalized by
R
Sk υ = 1. Let us consider
some examples.
39 A comprehensive list of known homotopy groups can be found in Dodson and
Parker (1997) (appendix).

5. A Glance at Topology
(a) Suppose that the smooth map f : S1 →S1 is given by the function Φ = Φ(ϕ)
where ϕ and Φ are angle coordinates. Then υ =
1
2π · dΦ. Hence
deg(f) =
Z
S1 f ∗υ = 1
2π
Z π
−π
Φ′(ϕ)dϕ = Φ(π) −Φ(−π)
2π
.
Since Φ is an angle variable on the unit circle, the mapping degree is an integer.
For example, if Φ(ϕ) = nϕ for some integer n, then deg(f) = n.
(b) Assume that the smooth map f : S2 →S2 is given by the functions
φ = Φ(ϕ, ϑ),
Θ = Θ(ϕ, ϑ)
with respect to spherical coordinates. Then υ =
1
4π cos Θ dΦ ∧dΘ. Hence
deg(f) =

Z π

Z π/2
−π/2
cos Θ(ϕ, ϑ) ∂(Φ, Θ)
∂(ϕ, ϑ) dϕdϑ.
Here, noting that dϕ ∧dϑ = −dϑ ∧dϕ, we use
dΦ ∧dΘ = (Φϕdϕ + Φϑdϑ) ∧(Θϕdϕ + Θϑdϑ)
= (ΦϕΘϑ −ΦϑΘϕ) dϕ ∧dϑ = ∂(Φ, Θ)
∂(ϕ, ϑ) dϕ ∧dϑ.
(c) Suppose that the smooth map f : S2 →S2 is described by the functions
X = X(ϕ, ϑ),
Y = Y (ϕ, ϑ),
Z = Z(ϕ, ϑ)
where X, Y, Z are Cartesian coordinates. Then
υ = XdY ∧dZ + Y dZ ∧dX + ZdX ∧dY
4π
.
For the mapping degree, this implies
deg(f) = 1

This follows from
ZdX ∧dY = Z(Xϕdϕ + Xϑdϑ) ∧(Yϕdϕ + Yϑdϑ)
= Z(XϕYϑ −YϕXϑ) dϕ ∧dϑ
along with the cyclic permutation X →Y →Z →X.
(d) For a smooth map f : S3 →S2, the mapping degree can be computed by using
the formula
deg(f) =
Z
S3 f ∗υ ∧ω
along with the normalized volume form υ on S2 and the 1-form
ω := 8ψ2 sin ϑ dψ
π(1 + ψ2)3 + 2ψ2 cos2 ϑ dϕ
π(1 + ψ2)2 .
Here, ϕ, ϑ, ψ denote spherical coordinates on S3 where −π < ϕ ≤π along with
−π
2 ≤ϑ ≤π
2 and 0 ≤ψ ≤π. The Hopf map has the mapping degree one.40
40 The proof can be found in Schwarz (1994), p. 164 and Spanier (1989), p. 489.

The homotopy functor and the mapping degree for continuous maps.
Let
f : X →Y
be a continuous map from the topological space X into the topological space Y . It
can be shown that for each k = 1, 2, . . . , the map f induces a group epimorphism
f ∗: πk(X) →πk(Y )
in a quite natural manner. The following crucial properties hold.
(C) Composition of maps: For continuous maps f : X →Y and g : Y →Z, the
composition g ◦f corresponds to the composition f ∗◦g∗.
(I) Identity map: The identity map on X corresponds to the identity map on πk(X)
for all k.
(H) Homeomorphism: If f : X →Y is a homeomorphism, then the induced map
f ∗: πk(X) →πk(Y ) is a group isomorphism for all k.
This homotopy functor allows us to deﬁne the mapping degree for continuous maps
f : Sk →Sk,
k = 1, 2, . . .
In fact, the homotopy functor generates the group epimorphism
f ∗: πk(Sk) →πk(Sk).
where πk(Sk) = Z. We now deﬁne deg(f) := f ∗(1).
Generalization of the mapping degree. Consider a continuous map
F : Sk →Rk+1 \ {0},
k = 1, 2, . . . .
This yields the normalized map
f : Sk →Sk,
k = 1, 2, . . .
by setting f(x) := F(x)/||F(x)||. We now deﬁne the mapping degree of the mapping
F by
deg(F) := deg(f).
Suppose that we are given the smooth map
F : Bk+1 →Rk+1,
k = 1, 2, . . .
on the closed (k + 1)-dimensional unit ball such that the following are met:
• F(x) ̸= 0 on the boundary Sk.
• The map F has precisely the zeros x1, . . . , xN on Bk+1.
• The zeros are regular, that is, det F ′(xj) ̸= 0 for all j.41
Then, the mapping degree can be computed by the simple formula
deg(F) = sgn det F ′(x1) + . . . + sgn det F ′(xN).
This shows that the mapping degree generalizes the 1-dimensional concept intro-
duced on page 228
The homotopy functor is the prototype of functors in algebraic topology. The
crucial homology and cohomology functors will be studied in Volume IV on quantum
mathematics.
41 The symbol det F ′(xj) denotes the Jacobian of the map F at the point xj; this
is the determinant of the ﬁrst partial derivatives of the components of F at the
point xj.

274
5. A Glance at Topology
These functors allow us to reduce the study of topological spaces and con-
tinuous maps to the study of groups and group morphisms.
To illustrate this, let us prove that there is no homeomorphism
f : B2 →S1
In fact, suppose that there exists such a homeomorphism. Then, the map
f ∗: π1(B2) →π1(S1)
(5.27)
is a group isomorphism. Since the unit ball is simply connected, π1(B2) = 0. How-
ever, π1(S1) = Z. Thus, there is no group isomorphism of the form (5.27). This is
the desired contradiction.
5.7.4 Grassmann Manifolds and Projective Geometry
Grassmann manifold. By a 1-dimensional linear subspace of the complex Hilbert
space C2, we understand a set of the form
L(ψ) := {λψ : λ ∈C}
where ψ is a ﬁxed nonzero element of C2. Without loss of generality, we can choose
ψ in such a way that ||ψ|| = 1. Then
C2 =
[
ψ∈S(C2)
L(ψ).
Obviously, the map L(ψ) →[ψ] is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of
linear 1-dimensional subspaces L(ψ) and the set of quantum states [ψ]. Therefore,
a quantum state can also be deﬁned as a linear 1-dimensional subspace of C2.
In mathematics, the space of all one-dimensional subspaces of C2 is called the 1-
Grassmann manifold G1(C2) of C2.
Rays and projective space. By a ray, we understand a set of the form
R(ψ) := {λψ : λ ∈C, λ ̸= 0}
where ψ ∈S(C2). The map
R(ψ) →[ψ]
yields a one-to-one correspondence between the set of rays P(C2) and the set of
quantum states. In mathematics, the set of rays L(ψ) is also called the complex
1-dimensional projective space P1
C.
Summarizing, there exist the following three equivalent possibilities for deﬁning
the space of quantum states of the Hilbert space C2, namely,
(i) the orbit space S(C2)/U(1) of the unit sphere S(C2) under the action of the
group U(1) on S(C2),
(ii) the 1-Grassmann manifold G1(C2) of C2 which consists of all complex one-
dimensional subspaces of C2,
(iii) the complex one-dimensional projective space P1
C of rays in C2.

5.8 Perspectives
275
These objects are well-known in algebraic geometry. In some sense, projective spaces
are the simplest geometric objects which possess a nontrivial topology. Explicitly,
we have the following homeomorphisms:
S(C2)/U(1) ∼= S2 ∼= G1(C2) ∼= P1
C.
The complex projective space P1
C is a K¨ahler manifold. This is proved in Jost
(2002a), Chap. 5. The Hopf bundle is an example for the following fascinating
development in sciences:
Physicists and mathematicians have studied completely diﬀerent deep ques-
tions posed by nature and by intrinsic mathematics, respectively. Finally,
they have arrived at the same highly nontrivial mathematical tools.
5.8 Perspectives
For further prototypes of important topological phenomena in physics, we refer to
the following sections of the present volume:
• cohomology and potentials of physical ﬁelds (Sect. 16.8.2);
• the cohomology of the unite circle, the unit sphere, and the torus (Sect. 16.8.3);
• cohomology and atomic spectra (Sect. 16.8.4);
• cohomology and BRST symmetry (the classiﬁcation of physical states and the
elimination of ghosts, and the cohomology of Lie groups) (Sect. 16.8.5).
Much material on topology can be found in Volume IV on quantum mathemat-
ics. In particular, we will investigate there homology groups, cohomology groups,
homotopy groups, and characteristic classes. In particular, we will show that the
fundamental concepts of homology and cohomology are rooted in the properties of
electric circuits.

6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and
Physics
Partition functions are the main tool for studying many-particle systems.
Folklore
Many-particle systems play a fundamental role in both mathematics and physics.
• In physics, we encounter systems of molecules (e.g., gases or liquids) or systems
of elementary particles in quantum ﬁeld theory.
• In mathematics, for example, we want to study the system of prime numbers.
In the 19th century, physicists developed the methods of statistical mechanics for
studying many-particle systems, whereas mathematicians proved the distribution
law for prime numbers. It turns out that the two apparently diﬀerent approaches
can be traced back to the same mathematical root, namely, the notion of partition
function. In modern quantum ﬁeld theory, the Feynman functional integral can be
viewed as a partition function, as we will discuss later on. The typical procedure
proceeds in the following two steps.
(i) Coding: The many-particle system is encoded into one single function called a
partition function (e.g., the Boltzmann partition function in statistical physics,
Riemann’s zeta function or Dirichlet’s L-function for describing prime numbers,
the Feynman functional integral in quantum ﬁeld theory). The idea goes back
to Euler; in 1737 he proved the identity
Y
p
„
1 −1
ps
«−1
=
∞
X
n=1
1
ns = ζ(s)
for all real numbers s > 1. The product refers to all prime numbers p.
(ii) Decoding: The task is to get crucial information about the many-particle system
by studying the properties of the partition function. The idea goes back to
Riemann. He recognized that the zeta function ζ extends holomorphically to
the punctured complex plane C \ {0}, and that the detailed knowledge on the
distribution of the zeros of the zeta function allows far-reaching statements
about the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers. This is related to the
famous Riemann hypothesis to be considered on page 296.
The complexity of justifying the Riemann hypothesis and the mathematical trouble
with the Feynman path integral prove that step (ii) is much more complex than
step (i). By analytic continuation, the series
∞
X
n=1

can be assigned the value ζ(s) for all complex numbers s with s ̸= 1. In particular,
for the uncritical value s = 0, we can assign the value

Interestingly enough, this formula is closely related to a physical experiment called

that this function enters the 1900 Planck radiation law on page 101. Explicitly,
B0 = 1, B1 = −1
2, B2 = 1
6, B4 = −1
30, B6 = 1

and Bn = 0 for n = 3, 5, 7, . . . This yields
ζ(0) = −1

ζ(−1) = −1

ζ(−3) =

More generally,
ζ(1 −2m) = −B2m

ζ(−2m) = 0,
m = 1, 2, 3, . . .
In 1734 Euler proved the famous formulas

More generally,
ζ(2m) = (−1)m−122m−1B2m

m = 1, 2, . . .
The properties of ζ(2m + 1) for m = 1, 2, 3, .. represent a famous open problem of
mathematics. In 1986 Roger Ap´ery created a sensation by proving the irrationality
of the number ζ(3) = 1.2020569 . . .3
1 The proof can be found in Zagier (1981), p. 26.
2 These numbers were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705).
3 See the survey article by M. Kontsevich and D. Zagier, Periods. In: B. Enquist
and W. Schmid (Eds.) (2001), pp. 771–808. This article contains a wealth of
sophisticated material on the values of integrals over rational integrands and
their properties. Such numbers are generally called periods. Prototypes are the
number π and the periods of elliptic integrals.

6.1 Partition Function in Statistical Physics
Statistical physics is based on the partition function
Z(T, µ, V ) :=
M
X
m=1
e(µNm−Em)/kT .
(6.2)
Here, we assume that the physical system under consideration can be located in
precisely M diﬀerent states S1, . . . , SM. Each state Sm is characterized by
• the energy Em, and
• the particle number Nm.
Energy and particle number depend on the volume V of the system. The positive
real parameter T is called absolute temperature, and the real parameter µ is called
chemical potential. Finally, k denotes the Boltzmann constant. In SI units, k =
1.380·10−23Joule/Kelvin. The point is that the knowledge of the partition function
allows us to compute all of the important thermodynamic quantities of the physical
system. Let us summarize this. The probability of ﬁnding the system in the state
Sm is given by
pm := e(µNm−Em)/kT
Z(T, µ, V )
,
m = 1, . . . , M.
This implies the mean energy
E :=
M

m=1
pmEm,
the square of the energy ﬂuctuation
(∆E)2 :=

and the square of the particle number ﬂuctuation
(∆N)2 :=
M

m=1
pm(Nm −N)2.
The fundamental quantity

280
6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
S := −k

is called the entropy of the physical system. We will show in Volume IV on quantum
mathematics that the entropy measures the disorder of the system.
• The entropy S is minimal if, say, p1 = 1, p2 = p3 = . . . = pM = 0 (maximal
order). Then S = 0.
• The entropy S is maximal if p1 = p2 = . . . = pM =
1
M (maximal disorder). Then
S = kM ln M.
In addition, we will show in Volume IV that the entropy S is equal to the mean
number of questions with yes-no answers which are necessary in order to determine
the state of the physical system. Thus, the entropy is equal to the mean information
gained after measuring the state of the physical system. In terms of biology, the
complexity of a biological system increases if its order increases, and hence its
entropy decreases.
The statistical potential. The function
Ω(T, µ, V ) := −kT ln Z(T, µ, V )
is called the statistical potential (or the Gibbs potential) of the physical system.
We get the partial derivatives
S = −ΩT ,
N = −Ωµ,
P = −ΩV
where P denotes the pressure of the system. Moreover, we obtain the mean free
energy
F := Ω+ µN,
and the mean inner energy E = F + ST. Physicists introduce the fugacity
z := eµ/kT .
Using this, the partition function can be written as
Z(T, µ, V ) =
Nmax
X
N=0
zNZN(T, µ, V )
where we set
ZN(T, µ, V ) :=
X
Nm=N
e−Em/kT .
Here, we sum over the energies Em of all the possible states which correspond to
N particles.
The extended statistical potential. Replacing the energy Em by the sum
Em + Jm, we introduce
Ω+(µ, T, V ; J) := −kT ln
M
X
m=1
e(µNm−Em−Jm)/kT .
The additional real parameters J1, . . . , JM are called source parameters by physi-
cists. For the probability, we then get

This formula is frequently used by physicists in order to compute the ground state
energy of non-degenerate ground states.
The Riemann zeta function represents a special partition function. To see this,
choose the chemical potential µ = 0 and the special energy levels

Historical remarks. Classical statistical physics was created by Maxwell
(1831–1879) and Boltzmann (1844–1906); it was completed by Gibbs (1839–1903)
who was professor for mathematical physics at Yale University (Connecticut,
U.S.A.). Gibbs used the following classical partition function
Zclass =
Z
R6 e−E(x,p)/kT d3x d3p
h3
for suﬃciently high temperature T . Here, x and p are the position vector and
the momentum vector of a particle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, respectively.
Since Zclass has to be a dimensionless physical quantity, we introduce an arbitrary

constant h3 where h has the physical dimension of action. In classical physics,
there is no such distinguished physical constant. However, the situation changes
completely in quantum physics. In 1900 Planck (1858–1947) introduced his quantum
of action, h. We now have the following heuristic principle which is successfully used
by physicists:
The high-temperature approximation of quantum statistics is obtained from
classical statistical physics by subdividing the phase space into cells of vol-
ume h3.
For example, we will use this principle of phase space quantization for computing
the cross section of scattering processes on page 838. Important contributions to the
development of quantum statistics were made by Einstein (1879–1955), Pauli (1900–
1958) (exclusion principle), Bose (1894–1974) (Bose–Einstein statistics for bosons),
Dirac (1902–1984), Fermi (1901–1954) (Dirac–Fermi statistics for fermions), von
Neumann (1903–1957) (density matrix), Lev Landau (1908–1968) (low tempera-
tures and liquid helium), and Schwinger (1918–1994) (Green’s function and KMS
states of thermodynamic equilibrium). In fact, high-technology is based on solid
state physics and quantum statistics (e.g., semiconductors, superconductors, and
lasers). Moreover, the structure of stars (e.g., white dwarfs, neutron stars, super-
novae, black holes), and the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang can only
be understood by using the methods of quantum statistics. This can be found in
Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV. We will come back to this fascinating topic in Volume III
of this treatise.
6.2 Euler’s Partition Function
Read Euler, he is the master of us all.
Marquis de Pierre Simon Laplace4
We want to study the decomposition of natural numbers into the sum of natural
numbers. This is a basic problem in additive number theory. To this end, let n be
a nonzero natural number. We deﬁne
p(n) := number of decompositions of n
into a sum of nonzero natural numbers.
For example, one has p(3) = 3, since
3 = 1 + 1 + 1,
3 = 2 + 1,
3 = 3.
We also set p(0) := 1. Following Euler, we deﬁne the partition function
P(q) :=
∞
X
n=0
p(n)qn.
This represents the generating function for p(0), p(1), p(2), . . .
Euler’s theorem. For all complex numbers q with |q| < 1, one has the con-
vergent product representation
4 Euler (1707–1783), Laplace (1749–1827), Fourier (1768–1830), Hardy (1877–
1947), Ramanujan (1887–1920), Hecke (1887–1947), Rademacher (1892–1969).

This theorem was obtained by Hardy and Ramanujan in 1918. Rademacher discov-
ered in 1937 that p(n) can be expanded in a convergent series in n. His proof used

The proof can be found in T. Apostol, Modular Functions and Dirichlet Series in
Number Theory, Springer, New York, 1990. Let C> := {τ ∈C : ℑ(τ) > 0} be the
open upper half-plane. The Dedekind eta function is holomorphic on C>, and it
has the symmetry property

(6.6)
and all modular transformations (i.e., for all integers a, b, c, d with ad −bc = 1).
Here, ε is a 24th root of unity (i.e., ε24 = 1).
Modular forms of weight k. Let k be an integer. By deﬁnition, a modular
form f of weight k has the following properties.
• The function f : C> →C is holomorphic.
• The function f satisﬁes the symmetry condition

and all modular transformations.
• The Fourier expansion f(τ) = P

n = −1, −2, . . .
Typically, modular forms satisfy sophisticated relations. Don Zagier writes in his
beautiful survey article on modular forms:5
The importance of modular forms stems from the conjunction of the fol-
lowing two facts.
(i) They arise naturally in a wide variety of contexts in mathematics and
physics and often encode the arithmetically interesting information
about a problem.

sion).

6.3 Discrete Laplace Transformation

(ii) The space Mk of modular forms of weight k is ﬁnite-dimensional for
each integer k.
The point is that if dim Mk = d and we have more than d situations
giving rise to modular forms in Mk, then we automatically have a linear
relation among these functions and hence get ‘for free’ information – often
highly nontrivial – relating these diﬀerent situations. . . What we meant
by (i) above is that nature – both physically and mathematically – often
produces situations described by numbers which turn out to be the Fourier
coeﬃcients of a modular form. These can be as disparate as multiplicities
of energy levels, numbers of vectors in a lattice of given length, sums over
the divisors of integers, special values of zeta functions, or numbers of
solutions of Diophantine equations. But the fact that all of these diﬀerent
objects land in the little space Mk forces the existence of relations among
them. . .
The key to the rich internal structure of the theory of modular forms is
the existence of a commutative algebra (Hecke algebra) of operators Tn
(n ∈N) acting on the space Mk. The space Mk has a canonical basis
of simultaneous eigenvectors of all the Hecke operators Tn; these special
modular forms have the property that their Fourier coeﬃcients a(n) are al-
gebraic integers and satisfy the multiplicative property a(nm) = a(n)a(m)
whenever n and m are relative prime.

sends each sequence (a0, a1, a2) of complex numbers to a formal power series ex-
pansion f. We want to study the properties of the map L.
The Tauberian theorem. If the function f is holomorphic on the open unit
disc {z ∈C : |z| < 1} and it has the power series expansion (6.7), then the function
f is called the generating function of the sequence (a0, a1, . . .). In this case, we have
the inverse transformation formula (6.8) for each real number r ∈]0, 1[. We now
want to investigate the formula

(6.9)
where ε is a positive real parameter. Mnemonically, this can be written as

(i) The 1826 Abelian theorem: Relation (6.9) is valid if the right-hand series is
convergent.

and
an = o

n →∞.
(6.10)
Theorem (i) describes a speciﬁc property of the map L, whereas theorem (ii) refers
to the inverse map L−1. These two theorems are due to Abel (1802–1829) and
Tauber (1866–1942).6 In 1911, Hardy (1877–1947) and Littlewood (1885–1977)
proved a sophisticated result saying that the condition (6.10) can be replaced by
the weaker condition
an = O
„ 1
n
«
,
n →∞.
The theorems (i) and (ii) are prototypes of numerous sophisticated mathematical
theorems about sums and integrals. This is summarized in the modern standard
text by Korevaar (2004). The transformation
z = eiE,
ℑ(E) > 0
maps the open upper half-plane conformally onto the open unit disc. In terms of
the variable E, the discrete Laplace transform looks like
F(E) =
∞
X
n=0
aneiEn,
ℑ(E) > 0.
The corresponding integral transform reads as
G(E) =
Z ∞
0
a(t)eiEt/ℏdt,
ℑ(E) > 0.
This is called the Laplace transform. In physics, the variable t (resp. E) has the
meaning of time (resp. energy). Engineers use the Laplace transform for computing
electric circuits. Then, we set E = ωℏwhere the variable ω corresponds to frequency.
The Laplace transform describes a crucial duality between time and energy (resp.
time and frequency).
The rabbit problem and Fibonacci numbers. The discrete Laplace trans-
form can be used in order to solve diﬀerence equations. Let us consider a classic
problem. The most accomplished mathematician of the Middle Ages was Leonardo
de Pisa (1175–1250) called Fibonacci who lived in Italy. Fibonacci is a shortened
form of Filius Bonaccio (son of Bonaccio). In his famous 1202 Liber Abaci (Book
of the Abacus), Fibonacci introduced the Arabic system of numbers to Europe.7
Fibonacci formulated and solved the rabbit problem which leads to the discrete
dynamical system
6 Alfred Tauber was murdered in the German concentration camp Theresienstadt
(Tereˇzin).
7 The decimal system was introduced much later on the European mainland by
the Dutch engineer Simon Stevin in 1585.

N((n + 2)∆t) = N((n + 1)∆t) + N(n∆t),
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(6.11)
Explicitly, the rabbit problem reads as follows:
• A pair of adult rabbits produces a pair of baby rabbits once each month.
• Each pair of baby rabbits requires one month to grow to be adults and subse-
quently produces one pair of baby rabbits each month thereafter.
• Determine the number N(n∆t) of adult rabbit pairs after n months. In this
model, Fibonacci assumed that rabbits are immortal.
Noting that the number of pairs of baby rabbits is equal to the number of adult
rabbit pairs in the previous month, we get the diﬀerence equation (6.11). For given
initial values N(0) = 0 and N(∆t) = 1, one checks explicitly that the solution is
given by the formula
N(n∆t) =

due to Binnet (1786-1856). The irrational number

is the positive solution of the equation
λ2 −λ −1 = 0.
(6.13)
which is called the characteristic equation to the original diﬀerence equation (6.11).
The nonnegative integers N(n∆t) are called the Fibonacci numbers. The ﬁrst Fi-
bonacci numbers read as
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610.
For example, after 15 months the number of adult rabbit pairs equals 610. For
the mathematicians in the 13th century, it was a great surprise that the integer
Fibonacci numbers are generated by the irrational numbers r and −1
r. Obviously,
we have the asymptotic law
lim
n→∞
N(n∆t + ∆t)
N(n∆t)
= r.
For large times, we get the asymptotic equation8
N(n∆t) ≃rn

as
n →∞.
Let us motivate the solution by using two diﬀerent methods.
(i) The ansatz method: Letting N(n∆T ) := λn, we get λ2+n = λ1+n +λn, implying
the characteristic equation (6.13) which has the two solutions λ± := 1
2(1±
√
5).
Hence λ+ = r and λ−= −1
r. By superposition,
N(n∆t) = aλn
+ + bλn
−.
8 Recall that f(n) ≃g(n) as n →∞means that f(n)
g(n) →1 as n →∞.

Fig. 6.1. The golden ratio
From the initial conditions N(0) = 0 and N(∆t) = 1, we get the constants a
and b, giving the solution (6.12). This solution method resembles the ansatz
N(t) := eλt for solving the ordinary diﬀerential equation
N ′′ = N ′ + N
which leads to the characteristic equation (6.13) as well.
(ii) Laplace’s method of generating function F: Set an := N(n∆t) and
F(z) := a0 + a1z + a2z2 + . . .
The original diﬀerence equation reads as an+2 = an+1 + an. Hence
F −a0 −a1z
z2
= F −a0
z
+ F.
Since a0 = 0 and a1 = 1,
F =
z
1 −z −z2 .
It remains to compute the coeﬃcients an of F. This can be done easily by
using the method of partial fractions. To begin with, note that the equation
1 −z −z2 = 0 has the zeros z =
1
λ± , since the substitution z =
1
λ yields
the characteristic equation λ2 −λ −1 = 0. Explicitly, we get the following
decomposition
F =

By applying the geometric series,

This way we obtain the desired solution an =

Note that the proof (ii) has a formal character, since we did not check the con-
vergence of the power series expansion. It turns out that it is not necessary to
check the convergence; in Volume II we will establish the Mikusi´nski calculus for
hyperfunctions which leads to expressions being always convergent, in a generalized
sense.
The golden ratio and the chaotic motion of asteroids. The number r
is one of the most famous irrational numbers. It is called the golden ratio for the
following reason. Subdivide the unit interval by the point r into two subintervals
such that
r
1 −r = 1
r .
Then r2−r−1 = 0 (Fig. 6.1) In ancient times, the golden ratio played an important
role in architecture for aesthetical reasons.9 The iterative method
9 Applications of the golden ratio in art and sciences including quasi-crystals and
biological objects can be found in Dunlap (1997) and Koshy (2001).

converges to the golden ratio r as n →∞. This is the most regular continued
fraction,

In this sense, the golden ratio is the “most irrational” real number. If one wants
to simulate chaotic motion of asteroids on computers in the framework of the
Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory (KAM theory), one uses the iterative method
(6.14) (see Scheck (2000), Vol. 1). Surprisingly enough, this method works perfectly
despite the rational character of the approximations.
Applications of discrete dynamical systems. In mathematics, the equa-
tions of motion of a discrete dynamical system are called diﬀerence equations. Nowa-
days such equations are used
• for solving partial diﬀerential equations on computers (see Knabner and Anger-
mann (2003)),
• for modelling deterministic chaos in physics (see Schuster (1994)),
• for studying mathematical models on both the origin of life, taking metabolism
into account (see Dyson (1999a)), and
• virus dynamics in immunology (see Noack and May (2000)). This concerns, for
example, the spread of aids.

which is called the Mellin transform. The Mellin transform (6.18) of the function

Γ(s) =

e−ττ s−1 dτ
for all
s ∈C, ℜ(s) > 0.
(6.19)
The gamma function can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function in
the complex plane which has poles only at the points s = 0, −1, −2, . . ., and these
poles are simple. The Laurent series at the pole s = −n with n = 0, 1, . . . reads as
Γ(s) =
(−1)n
n!(s + n) + a0 + a1(s + n) + . . .
The gamma function has the following characteristic properties:
(i) Γ(1) = 1.
(ii) Γ(n) = (n −1)! for n = 2, 3, . . .
(iii) Γ(z + 1) = zΓ(z) for all z ∈C with z ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . .
The integral transformation

after Robert Mellin (1854–1933) who wrote a fundamental paper about this trans-
formation in 1895. In particular, the Riemann zeta function can be represented by
the following normalized Mellin transform

discussed in Sect. 11.9.4 on page 665.

exists. This function is called Euler’s beta function. The relation between the beta
function and the gamma function reads as
B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)
Γ(p + q) .
The beta function played an important role in the history of string theory. In
the 1970s, the physicist Veneziano looked for a function that fulﬁlls a number of
natural postulates for the scattering amplitudes of elementary particles in strong
interaction. He found out that Euler’s beta function did the job. This observation
initiated string theory as a theory for strong interaction. Later on, the paradigm
changed completely. Nowadays string theory is a candidate for describing all of the
fundamental forces in the universe.

I feel that I am expressing my gratitude for the honor that the Berlin
Academy has endowed upon me by appointing me as one of its correspon-
dents, by making immediate use of my privileges thereof and presenting
the results of an investigation on the frequency of prime numbers; a subject
which, by the interest which Gauss (1777–1855) and Dirichlet (1805–1859)
have given it over a long period of time, seems to be worthy of renewed
mention.10

to the famous Casimir eﬀect in quantum ﬁeld physics will be studied on page 299.
6.5.1 The Prime Number Theorem – a Pearl of Mathematics
A natural number p is said to be a prime iﬀp ≥2 and the only divisors of p are 1
and p itself. The ﬁrst prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Euclid (300 B.C.)
knew that
10 This is the beginning of one of the most famous works in all of mathematics.
In this short paper Riemann develops his new ideas and presents the famous
“Riemann hypothesis”. The German title of this paper reads as “ ¨Uber die An-
zahl von Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr¨osse”, Berliner Monatsberichte
1859, pp. 671–680. The collected works of Riemann (1990) are all in all just one
volume. However, every single one of these papers is a jewel of mathematics. Rie-
mann (1826–1866) has profoundly inﬂuenced the mathematics and physics of the
twentieth century with his treasure of ideas. We refer to K. Maurin, Riemann’s
Legacy, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1997.

For more than hundred years, the proof of the prime number conjecture was a
famous open problem in mathematics. In 1896, Jacques Hadamard (1865–1963) and
Charles de la Vale´e-Poussin (1866–1962) proved independently the prime number
theorem. Their proofs were long and intricate. A simple analytic proof was given
by Newman (1980). Our proof follows Zagier (1996).
Proof. For complex numbers s with ℜ(s) > 1 and real numbers x, let us introduce
the two auxiliary functions
Φ(s) :=
X
p
ln p
ps ,
ϑ(x) :=
X
p≤x
ln p.
Here, we sum over all the primes p. The following proof uses analytic continuation of
the Riemann ζ function along with Newman’s adiabatic theorem based on Cauchy’s
integral formula. We will proceed in the following steps.
(i) For the Riemann zeta function, the series
ζ(s) =

s−1 extends holomorphically
to the set {s ∈C : ℜ(s) ≥1}.

Therefore, lim inf f(x) = lim sup f(x) = 1 as x →+∞. This implies

6.5.2 The Riemann Hypothesis
Billions of zeros cannot be wrong. Recent work by van de Lune has shown
that the ﬁrst 10 billion zeros of the zeta function are on the critical line. . .
The Riemann hypothesis tells us that the primes are distributed in as nice
a way as possible. If the Riemann hypothesis would be false, there would
be some strange irregularities in the distribution of primes. The ﬁrst zero
oﬀthe line would be a very important mathematical constant. It seems
unlikely that nature is that perverse!
Brian Conrey, 2003
The Riemann hypothesis12
In 1859 Riemann wrote a fundamental paper about the zeta function. For the ﬁrst
time, he studied this function for complex arguments. He proved that the zeta
function is well-deﬁned for all complex numbers s ̸= 1, in the sense of an analytic
continuation. To this end, Riemann used the following functional equation for the
zeta function,
2s−1πs
Γ(s)
ζ(1 −s) = ζ(s) cos πs
2
for all
s ∈C.
The zeta function has the trivial zeros s = −2, −4, −6, . . . The Riemann hypothesis
claims that all of the other zeros s satisfy the condition
ℜ(s) = 1
2.
This is the most famous open problem in mathematics. If the Riemann hypothesis
is right, then one has the following sharp inequality
|π(x) −Li(x)| ≤const · √x ln x
for all
x ≥2
(6.22)
where π(.) denotes the prime number distribution function.
6.5.3 Dirichlet’s L-Function
Over the years striking analogies have been observed between the Riemann
ζ-function and other L-functions. While these functions are seemingly in-
dependent of each other, there is growing evidence that they are all some-
how connected in a way that we do not fully understand. . . There is a
growing body of evidence that there is a conspiracy between L-functions –
a conspiracy which is preventing us from solving the Riemann hypothesis.
Brian Conrey, 2003
The Riemann hypothesis
In his famous 1801 treatise on number theory Disquisitiones arithmeticae, the young
Gauss studied the theory of quadratic number ﬁelds. Such ﬁelds are generated by
adding the solution of a quadratic algebraic equation to the ﬁeld of rational numbers
Q. For example, adding the solution of the quadratic equation
x2 −5 = 0
12 Notices of the American Mathematical Society 50 (3) (2003), pp. 341–353

6.5 The Riemann Zeta Function

to the ﬁeld Q we get the quadratic number ﬁeld Q(
√
5) consisting of all numbers
a+b
√
5 where a and b are rational numbers. In 1837 Dirichlet (1805–1859) founded
analytic number theory. He used L-functions in order to get his famous explicit
formulas for the class numbers of quadratic number ﬁelds. These formulas describe
deep structural properties of quadratic number ﬁelds. In 1855 Dirichlet became the
follower of Gauss in G¨ottingen. Dirichlet also used L-series in order to prove the
following crucial theorem:
If the integers n and d are positive, then the sequence
n, n + d, n + 2d, . . . contains inﬁnitely many primes.
For the proofs, we refer to Zagier (1981), and Stein, Shakarchi (2003), Vol. 1. In
order to explain the basic idea of Dirichlet’s L-function, let us consider a simple
example.
The ring Z/mod 4. Let Z denote the ring of integers. For n, m ∈Z, we write
n ≡m
mod 4
iﬀthe diﬀerence n −m is divisible by 4. The set
[n] := {m ∈Z : m ≡n
mod 4}
is called the rest class modulo 4, and the elements of [n] are called the representa-
tives of the rest class. For example,
[3] := {3, 3 ± 4, 3 ± 8, 3 ± 12, . . .}.
Addition and multiplication of rest classes are deﬁned by the corresponding oper-
ations for the representatives. Explicitly,
[n] + [m] := [n + m],
[n][m] := [nm].
These deﬁnitions do not depend on the choice of representatives. The rest classes
[0], [1], [2], [3] form the ring Z/mod 4 with the zero element [0] and the unit element
[1]. Since
[2][2] = [4] = [0],
[3][3] = [9] = [1],
precisely the elements [1], [3] are invertible.
Characters of the ring Z/mod 4. By a character of the ring Z/mod 4, we
understand a multiplicative map
χ : Z/mod 4 →C.
More precisely, for all elements a and b of Z/mod 4, we postulate that
χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b).
Furthermore, |χ(a)| = 1 for all invertible elements a, and χ(b) = 0 for all non-
invertible elements b. Explicitly, such a character is given by
χ([0]) := χ([2]) = 0,
χ([1]) := 1,
χ([3]) := −1.
The L-function of the ring Z/mod 4. Set χ(n) := χ([n]) for all integers n,
and deﬁne
Lχ(s) :=

for all complex numbers s with ℜ(s) > 1. Then

6.6 The Casimir Eﬀect in Quantum Field Theory and
the Epstein Zeta Function
How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human
thought independent of experience, is so admirably adapted to the objects
of reality.
Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
Let us study some physical eﬀect which allows us to prove experimentally the exis-
tence of the ground state energy of a quantum ﬁeld. This is the so-called Casimir
eﬀect. Consider two parallel, uncharged, perfectly conducting metallic plates (see
Fig. 6.2). From the classical point of view, there should not be any electromagnetic
force between the two plates. However, Casimir predicted in 1948 that the ﬂuctu-
ations of the ground state energy of the electromagnetic quantum ﬁeld cause an
attractive electromagnetic force between the two plates given by
F(d) = −π2ℏcL2
240d4
ex
where d is the distance between the two plates, and L2 is the surface area of each of
the two plates. Here, the unit vector ex points in direction of the x-axis. We write
F(d) = F(d)ex. Explicitly, in the SI system,
F(d) = −1.30 · 10−27 [L]2
[d]4 · N
where [L] and [d] are the numerical values of L and d, respectively, measured in
m (meter). Note that 1 N (Newton) = 1 kg m/s2. The tiny Casimir force F(d) can
be established experimentally. This eﬀect was ﬁrst studied by H. Casimir, On the

Proc. 51 (1948), 793–795.
Let us show how this Casimir force can be obtained by using both physical and
mathematical arguments. From the physical point of view, the two plates change
the situation of the ground state of the electromagnetic quantum ﬁeld. The ground
state is conﬁned by the two plates. We now postulate that the conﬁnement of the
ground state of a quantum ﬁelds causes a force. In the present case, we get
F(d) = −E′(d)
where E(d) is the ground state energy of the quantum ﬁeld between the two plates.13
The one-dimensional model. We ﬁrst consider a one-dimensional model. Let
A : [0, d] →R be a classical physical quantity which describes a standing wave with
A(0) = A(d) = 0. That is,
A(x) := A0 sin nπx
d ,
x ∈[0, d]
where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Here, we have the wave number
k(n) := nπ
d .
The corresponding travelling wave reads as
A(x, t) = A0 sin(k(n)x −ω(n)t),
x, t ∈R
(6.23)
with the propagation speed c = ω(n)
k(n) . In 1925 Heisenberg showed that the energy
levels of a harmonic quantum oscillator with angular frequency ω are given by
E = ℏω
„
N + 1
2
«
,
N = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The quantum number N = 0 describes the zero-point energy
E = ℏω
2 .
Furthermore, the quantum numbers N = 1, 2, . . . correspond to excited energy
states.
Let us now consider a quantum ﬁeld which is obtained by quantizing the clas-
sical ﬁeld (6.23). Heuristically, the quantum ﬁeld is given by an inﬁnite number of
harmonic quantum oscillators of frequencies ω(n) = ck(n) with n = 0, 1, . . . Nat-
urally enough, we assume that the ground state energy E(d) of the quantum ﬁeld
is given by the sum of the zero-point energies of the single harmonic oscillators.
Hence
E(d) =
∞
X
n=0
ℏω(n)

This implies
E(d) = πcℏ

13 Note that the derivative E′(d) of the energy E(d) with respect to the length
parameter d has the physical dimension of energy/length = force.

6.6 The Casimir Eﬀect in Quantum Field Theory and the Zeta Function
301
Obviously, this series is divergent. This diﬃculty is typical for quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries. In order to get a ﬁnite value as observed in the physical experiment, we will
argue as follows. To begin with, we choose a large cut-oﬀconstant R > 0, and we
introduce the truncated ground state energy
ER(d) := πcℏ
2d
∞
X
n=1
nθ(R −n)
where θ denotes the Heaviside function. Explicitly, θ(t) := 1 if t ≥0 and θ(t) := 0
if t < 0. Naturally enough, we postulate that
The true ground state energy does not depend on the arbitrarily chosen
cut-oﬀ.
In order to get such an energy expression, we introduce the truncated Riemann
zeta function
ζR(s) :=
∞
X
n=1
1
ns · θ(R −n)
for all complex numbers s. Obviously,
ER(d) = πcℏ
2d ζR(−1).
Let us now study the limit R →+∞.
• If ℜ(s) > 1, then the classical limit
lim
R→+∞ζR(s) =
∞
X
n=1
1
ns = ζ(s)
exists. The Riemann zeta function ζ is a meromorphic function on the complex
plane C with one simple pole at the point s = 1 and no other poles. Thus, ζ(s)
is well-deﬁned for all s ∈C \ {1}. In particular, ζ(−1) = −1
12.
• We now deﬁne the generalized limit
lim
R→+∞ζR(s) := ζ(s)
for all
s ∈C \ {1}
which is ﬁnite. We brieﬂy write this as
∞
X
n=1
1
ns = ζ(s)
for all
s ∈C \ {1}.
(6.24)
Now we deﬁne the ground state energy E(d) by setting
E(d) := πcℏ
2d ζ(−1) = −πcℏ
24d .
This method is called the zeta function regularization.
In what follows, we will show that a similar argument can be used in order
to get the energy expression (6.30) below for the Casimir eﬀect. The idea is to
replace the Riemann zeta function by the Epstein zeta function14 and to study the
14 P. Epstein, On the theory of general zeta functions I, II, Math. Ann. 56 (1903),
615–644; 63 (1907), 205–216 (in German).

(6.26)
Here, we only sum over lattice points (l, m, n) whose components are natural num-
bers, and we use the following weights:
• wlmn = 1 if the tupel (l, m, n) is non-degenerate, that is, none of the indices
l, m, n is equal to zero;
• wlmn := 1
2 if precisely one of the indices l, m, n is equal to zero;
• wlmn := 1
4 if precisely two of the indices l, m, n are equal to zero.
The expression (6.25) for the ground state energy of the electromagnetic quan-
tum ﬁeld will be thoroughly motivated in Volume II on quantum electrodynamics
by using the free photon ﬁeld. At this point let us only discuss the basic ideas.
Suppose that the functions A, U satisfy the wave equations
2A = 0,
2U = 0
and the Lorentz gauge condition div A +
˙U
c2 = 0. Then the electromagnetic ﬁeld
E = −˙A −grad U,
B = curl A
satisﬁes the Maxwell equations without electric charges and electric currents. Ac-
cording to the experimental situation pictured in Fig. 6.2 on page 299, we want to
construct standing electromagnetic waves on the parallelepiped
P :=
j
(x, y, z) ∈R3 :
0 ≤x ≤d, −L
2 ≤y, z ≤L
2
ﬀ
.
To this end, we set U := 0 and
A(x, t) := A0 sin(klmnx −ωlmnt)
(6.27)
with x = xex+yey +zez and klmn = kxex+kyey +kzez. The unit vectors ex, ey, ez
point into the direction of the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, respectively. Here, we choose
the wave numbers
kx := nπ
d ,
ky := lπ
L ,
kz := mπ
L ,
l, m, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
and the angular frequencies ωlmn := c||klmn|| along with
A0klmn = 0.
(6.28)

6.6 The Casimir Eﬀect in Quantum Field Theory and the Zeta Function
303
This transversality condition guarantees that the gauge condition div A = 0 is sat-
isﬁed. If klmn ̸= 0, then the equation (6.28) has two linearly independent vector
solutions A0 which correspond to two possible polarization directions of electro-
magnetic waves.
We now consider the corresponding quantum ﬁeld. Let us motivate that the
truncated ground state energy of the quantum ﬁeld is given by
ER(d) =
X
l,m,n∈N
wlmn · ℏωlmn · θ(R2 −l2 −m2 −n2).
Case 1: Non-degenerate oscillations. If the wave vector klmn is non-degenerate,
that is, all of the natural numbers l, m, n are diﬀerent from zero, then the oscillations
with angular frequency ωlmn contribute the amount of zero-point energy
2 · ℏωlmn
2
(6.29)
to the ground state energy of the quantum ﬁeld. The factor 2 corresponds to the two
polarization degrees of freedom of electromagnetic waves. The energy contribution
(6.29) is equal to
ℏωlmn = wlmn · ℏc||klmn|| = wlmn · πℏc
„ l2
L2 + m2
L2 + n2
d2
«1/2
with the weight wlmn := 1.
Case 2: Degenerate oscillations. If the wave vector klmn is degenerate (i.e.,
at least one of the natural numbers l, m, n is equal to zero), then the oscillation
(6.27) degenerates. This means that the oscillation is not 3-dimensional, but only
r-dimensional with r = 2, 1, 0. In this case, we use the weights wlmn :=
1
2, 1
4, 1
8,
respectively.15 This way we get the truncated ground state energy ER(d) from
(6.25) above. Setting λ := L
d , we obtain
ER(d) = πcℏ
8L
X
l,m,n∈Z
(l2 + m2 + λ2n2)1/2 · θ(R2 −l2 −m2 −n2).
Now deﬁne the Epstein zeta function

(l2 + m2 + λ2n2)s
for all λ > 0 and all complex numbers s with ℜ(s) > 3

sign means that the term (l, m, n) = (0, 0, 0) is to be omitted. This series converges.
For understanding the Casimir eﬀect, the following theorem is crucial.

meromorphic function on the complex plane with a simple pole at the point s = 3

In 1826, the ingenious young mathematician Niels Hendrik Abel (1802–1829) wrote
the following:
The divergent series are the invention of the devil, and it is a shame to
base on them any demonstration whatsoever. By using them, one may
draw any conclusion he pleases and that is why these series have produced
so many fallacies and so many paradoxes.
The experience of physicists shows that the deﬁnition of a convergent series is
too restrictive; sometimes nature also sees the information which is encoded in a
divergent series. In particular, one can say that
Nature sees analytic continuation.

6.7 Appendix: The Mellin Transformation and Other
Useful Analytic Techniques by Don Zagier
The Mellin transformation is a magic wand.
Folklore
The following material is not suﬃciently well known to a broad audience. The reader
should note that the tools to be described are extremely useful. These tools enlarge
the arsenal of weapons used in mathematical physics. They allow interesting appli-
cations concerning the asymptotic behavior of functions occurring in mathematics
and physics.
6.7.1 The Generalized Mellin Transformation
The Mellin transformation is a basic tool for analyzing the behavior of many impor-
tant functions in mathematics and mathematical physics, such as the zeta functions
occurring in number theory and in connection with various spectral problems in-
cluding the Casimir eﬀect. We describe it ﬁrst in its simplest form and then explain
how this basic deﬁnition can be extended to a much wider class of functions, im-
portant for many applications.
Let ϕ : ]0, ∞[→C be a function on the positive real axis which is reasonably
smooth (actually, continuous or even piecewise continuous would be enough) and
decays rapidly at both 0 and ∞, i.e., the function tAϕ(t) is bounded on ]0, ∞[ for
any A ∈R. Then the integral
˜ϕ(s) =
Z ∞
0
ϕ(t)ts−1dt
(6.31)
converges for any complex value s and deﬁnes a holomorphic function of s called the
Mellin transform of ϕ(t). The following small table, in which α denotes a complex
number and λ a positive real number shows how ˜ϕ(s) changes when ϕ(t) is modiﬁed
in various simple ways:
ϕ(λt)
tαϕ(t)
ϕ(tλ)
ϕ(t−1)
ϕ′(t)
λ−s ˜ϕ(s)
˜ϕ(s + α)
λ−s ˜ϕ(λ−1s)
˜ϕ(−s)
(1 −s) ˜ϕ(s −1)
(6.32)

6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
We also mention, although we will not use it in the sequel, that the function ϕ(t)
can be recovered from its Mellin transform by the inverse Mellin transformation
formula
ϕ(t) =
1
2πi
Z C+i∞
C−i∞
˜ϕ(s)t−sds
(0 < t < ∞),
where C is any real number. (That this is independent of C follows from Cauchy’s
formula (4.2) on page 212.)
The need for generalizing the Mellin transformation. In contrast to the
assumption formulated for the classical Mellin transformation above, most functions
which we encounter in practise are not very small at both zero and inﬁnity.
• If we assume that ϕ(t) is of rapid decay at inﬁnity but grows like t−A for some
real number A as t →+0, then the integral (6.31) converges and deﬁnes a
holomorphic function only in the right half-plane ℜ(s) > A.
• Similarly, if ϕ(t) is of rapid decay at zero but grows like t−B at inﬁnity for
some real number B, then ˜ϕ(s) makes sense and is holomorphic only in the left
half-plane ℜ(s) < B,
• while if ϕ(t) has polynomial growth at both ends, say like t−A at 0 and like t−B
at ∞with A < B, then ˜ϕ(s) is holomorphic only in the strip A < ℜ(s) < B.
But it turns out that in many cases the function ˜ϕ(s) has a meromorphic extension
to a larger half-plane or strip than the one in which the original integral (6.31)
converges, or even to the whole complex plane. Moreover, this extended Mellin
transform can sometimes be deﬁned even in cases where A > B, in which case the
integral (6.31) does not converge for any value of s at all.
Investigation of the generalized Mellin transform. We are going to con-
sider three diﬀerent cases.
Case 1: Let us start with the frequently occurring case where ϕ(t) is of rapid
decay at inﬁnity and is smooth in a neighborhood of zero, i.e., it has an asymptotic
expansion16
ϕ(t) ∼
∞
X
n=0
antn
(t →+0).
Then for s with ℜ(s) > 0 and any positive integer N, the integral (6.31) converges
and can be decomposed as follows:
˜ϕ(s) =
Z 1
0
ϕ(t)ts−1dt +
Z ∞

ϕ(t)ts−1dt

ϕ(t)ts−1dt.
The ﬁrst integral on the right converges in the larger half-plane ℜ(s) > −N and
the second for all s ∈C, so we deduce that ˜ϕ(s) has a meromorphic continuation
to ℜ(s) > −N with simple poles of residue an at s = −n (n = 0, . . . , N −1) and no
other singularities. Since this holds for every n, it follows that the Mellin transform
˜ϕ(s) in fact has a meromorphic continuation to all of C with simple poles of residue
an at s = −n (n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) and no other poles. The same argument shows that,
more generally, if ϕ(t) is of rapid decay at inﬁnity and has an asymptotic expansion
16 Recall that this means that the diﬀerence ϕ(t) −PN
n=0 antn is o(tN) as t →+0
for any integer N ≥1; it is not required that the series P∞
n=0 antn be convergent
for any positive t.

(6.33)
as t tends to zero, where the αj are real numbers tending to +∞as j →∞or
complex numbers with real parts tending to inﬁnity, then the function ˜ϕ(s) deﬁned
by the integral (6.31) for ℜ(s) > −minj ℜ(αj) has a meromorphic extension to
all of C with simple poles of residue aj at s = −αj (j = 1, 2, . . . ) and no other
poles. Yet more generally, we can allow terms of the form tα(ln t)m with λ ∈C
and m ∈Z≥0 in the asymptotic expansion of ϕ(t) at t = 0 and each such term
contributes a pole with principal part (−1)mm!/(s + α)m+1 at s = −α, because

∂m
∂αm
R 1
0 tα+s−1 dt = (−1)mm!/(α + s)m+1 for ℜ(s + α) > 0.
Case 2: By exactly the same considerations, or by replacing ϕ(t) by ϕ(t−1), we
ﬁnd that if ϕ(t) is of rapid decay (faster than any power of t) as t →+0 but has
an asymptotic expansion of the form
ϕ(t) ∼
∞
X
k=1
bk tβk
(t →∞)
(6.34)
at inﬁnity, where now the exponents βk are complex numbers whose real parts
tend to −∞, then the function ˜ϕ(s), originally deﬁned by (6.31) in a left half-plane
ℜ(s) < −maxk ℜ(βk), extends meromorphically to the whole complex s-plane with
simple poles of residue −bk at s = −βk and no other poles. (More generally, again
as before, we can allow terms bktβk(ln t)nk in (6.33) which then produce poles with
principal parts (−1)nk+1nk! bk/(s + βk)nk+1 at s = −βk.)
Case 3: Now we can use these ideas to deﬁne ˜ϕ(s) for functions which are not
small either at 0 or at ∞, even when the integral (6.31) does not converge for any
value of s. We simply assume that ϕ(t) is a smooth (or continuous) function on
]0, ∞[ which has asymptotic expansions of the forms (6.33) and (6.34) at zero and
inﬁnity, respectively. (Again, we could allow more general terms with powers of ln t
in the expansions, as already explained, but the corresponding modiﬁcations are
easy and for simplicity of expression we will assume expansions purely in powers of
t.) For convenience we assume that the numbering is such that ℜ(α1) ≤ℜ(α2) ≤· · ·
and ℜ(β1) ≥ℜ(β2) ≥· · · . Then, for any T > 0 (formerly we took T = 1, but the
extra freedom of being able to choose any value of T will be very useful later) we
deﬁne two “half-Mellin transforms” ˜ϕ≤T (s) and ˜ϕ≥T (s) by
˜ϕ≤T (s) =
Z T
0
ϕ(t) ts−1 dt
`
ℜ(s) > −ℜ(α1)
´
,
˜ϕ≥T (s) =
Z ∞
T
ϕ(t) ts−1 dt
`
ℜ(s) < −ℜ(β1)
´
.
Just as before, we see that for each integer J ≥1 the function ˜ϕ≤(s) extends by
the formula

to the half-plane ℜ(s) > −ℜ(αJ+1) and hence, letting J →∞, that ˜ϕ≤(s) is a
meromorphic function of s with simple poles of residue aj at s = −αj (j = 1, 2, . . . )
and no other poles. Similarly, ˜ϕ≥t(s) extends to a meromorphic function whose only
poles are simple ones of residue −bk at s = −βk. We now deﬁne

308
6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
˜ϕ(s) := ˜ϕ≤T (s) + ˜ϕ≥T (s).
(6.35)
This is a meromorphic function of s and is independent of the choice of T, since the
eﬀect of changing T to T ′ is simply to add the everywhere holomorphic function
R T ′
T
ϕ(t) ts−1 dt to ˜ϕ≤T (s) and subtract the same function from ˜ϕ≥(s), not aﬀecting
the sum of their analytic continuations.
In summary, if ϕ(t) is a function of t with asymptotic expansions as a sum of
powers of t (or of powers of t multiplied by integral powers of ln t) at both zero and
inﬁnity, then we can deﬁne in a canonical way a Mellin transform ˜ϕ(s) which is
meromorphic in the entire s-plane and whose poles reﬂect directly the coeﬃcients
in the asymptotic expansions of ϕ(t). This deﬁnition is consistent with and has the
same properties (6.32) as the original deﬁnition (6.31).
We end this section by giving two simple examples, while Sections 6.7.2 and
6.7.3 will give further applications of the method.
Example 1. Let ϕ(t) := tα, where α is a complex number. Then ϕ has an asymp-
totic expansion (6.33) at 0 with a single term α1 = α, a1 = 1, and an asymptotic
expansion (6.34) at ∞with a single term β1 = α, b1 = 1. We immediately ﬁnd that
˜ϕ≤T (s) = T s+α/(s + α) for ℜ(s + α) > 0 and
˜ϕ≥T (s) = −T s+α/(s + α)
for ℜ(s + α) < 0, so that, although the original Mellin transform integral (6.31)
does not converge for any value of s, the function ˜ϕ(s) deﬁned as the sum of the
meromorphic continuations of ˜ϕ≤T (s) and ˜ϕ≥T (s) makes sense, is independent of
T, and in fact is identically zero. More generally, we ﬁnd that
˜ϕ(s) ≡0
whenever ϕ(t) is a ﬁnite linear combination of functions of the form tα lnm t with
the exponents α ∈C and m ∈Z≥0. (These are exactly the functions whose images
ϕλ(t) := ϕ(λt) under the action of the multiplicative group R×
+ of positive real
numbers span a ﬁnite-dimensional space.) In particular, we see that the generalized
Mellin transformation is no longer injective.
Example 2. Let ϕ(t) := e−t. Here the integral (6.31) converges for ℜ(s) > 0 and
deﬁnes Euler’s gamma-function
Γ(s) =
Z ∞
0
e−tts−1dt
(ℜ(s) > 0).
(6.36)
From the fact that ϕ(t) is of rapid decay at inﬁnity and has the asymptotic (here
even convergent) expansion P∞
n=0(−t)n/n! at zero, we deduce that Γ(s) = ˜ϕ(s)
has a meromorphic continuation to all s with a simple pole of residue (−1)n/n! at
s = −n (n = 0, 1, . . . ) and no other poles.17 From the ﬁrst of the properties listed
in (6.32), we ﬁnd the following formula, which we will use many times:
ϕ(t) = e−λt
⇒
˜ϕ(s) = Γ(s) λ−s
(λ > 0).
(6.37)
17 Of course, in this special case these well-known properties can also be deduced
from the functional equation Γ(s+1) = sΓ(s) (proved for ℜ(s) > 0 by integration
by parts in the integral (6.36) deﬁning Γ(s)), N applications of which gives the
meromorphic extension Γ(s) = s−1(s + 1)−1 · · · (s + N −1)−1Γ(s + N) of Γ(s)
to the half-plane ℜ(s) > −N.

6.7.2 Dirichlet Series and their Special Values
In this section we look at functions ϕ(t) for which the Mellin transform deﬁned
in Sect. 6.7.1 is related to a Dirichlet series. The key formula is (6.37), because it
allows us to convert Dirichlet series into exponential series, which are much simpler.
Example 3. Deﬁne ϕ(t) for t > 0 by ϕ(t) = 1/(et −1). This function is of rapid
decay at inﬁnity and has an asymptotic expansion (actually convergent for t < 2π)

numbers. From the results of Sect. 6.7.1 we know that the Mellin transform ˜ϕ(s),
originally deﬁned for ℜ(s) > 1 by the integral (6.31) has a meromorphic contin-
uation to all s with simple poles of residue Br/r! at s = 1 −r (r = 0, 1, 2, . . . ).
On the other hand, since et > 1 for t > 0, we can expand ϕ(t) as a geometric
series e−t + e−2t + e−3t + · · · , so (6.37) gives (ﬁrst in the region of convergence)
˜ϕ(s) = Γ(s)ζ(s), where
ζ(s) =
∞
X
m=1
1

(ℜ(s) > 1)
(6.39)
is the Riemann zeta function. Since Γ(s), as we have seen is also meromorphic, with
simple poles of residue (−1)n/n! at non-positive integral arguments s = −n and
no other poles, and since Γ(s) (as is well-known and easily proved) never vanishes,
we deduce that ζ(s) has a meromorphic continuation to all s with a unique simple
pole of residue 1/Γ(1) = 1 at s = 1 and that its values at non-positive integral
arguments are rational numbers expressible in terms of the Bernoulli numbers:18
ζ(−n) = (−1)n Bn+1
n + 1
(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .).
(6.40)
Example 4. To approach ζ(s) in another way, we choose for ϕ(t) the theta function
ϑ(t) :=
∞
X
n=−∞
e−πn2t
(t > 0).
(6.41)
(The factor π in the exponent has been included for later convenience.) We can
write this out as
ϑ(t) = 1 + 2 e−πt + 2 e−4πt + · · · ,
(6.42)
and since the generalized Mellin transform of the function 1 is identically 0 by
Example 1, we deduce from (6.37) that ˜ϕ(s) = 2 ζ∗(2s), where
ζ∗(s) := π−s/2 Γ
“s
2
”
ζ(s).
(6.43)
To obtain the analytic properties of ζ(s) from the results of Sect. 6.7.1, we need the
asymptotics of ϑ(t) at zero and inﬁnity. They follow immediately from the following
famous result, due to Jacobi:
18 Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705), Maclaurin (1698–1746), Euler (1707–1783), Fourier
(1768–1830), Gauss (1777-1855), Poisson (1781–1840), Jacobi (1804–1851),
Dirichlet (1805–1859), Catalan (1814–1894), Riemann (1826–1866), Dedekind
(1831–1916), Mellin (1854–1933), Hurwitz (1859–1919), Epstein (1871–1939).

Proposition 6.3 The function ϑ(t) satisﬁes the functional equation
ϑ(t) = 1
√
t ϑ
„1
t
«
(t > 0).
(6.44)
Proof. Formula (6.44) is a special case of the Poisson summation formula, which
says that
X
n∈Z
f(n) =
X
n∈Z
ˆf(n)
(6.45)
for any suﬃciently well-behaved (i.e., smooth and small at inﬁnity) complex-valued
function f on the real line, where
ˆf(y) :=
Z ∞
−∞
f(x) e2πixy dx
is the Fourier transform of f, up to rescaling.19 Now let us consider the function
ft(x) := e−πtx2. Its Fourier transform is given by
ˆft(y) =
Z ∞
−∞
e−πtx2+2πixy dx = e−πy2/t
Z ∞
−∞
e−πt(x+iy/t)2 dx =
c
√
t f1/t(y),
where c > 0 is the constant c =
R ∞
−∞e−πx2dx. Applying (6.45) with f = ft therefore
gives ϑ(t) = ct−1/2ϑ(1/t), and taking t = 1 in this formula gives c = 1 and proves
equation (6.44).
2
Now we ﬁnd from (6.42) that ϑ(t) has the asymptotic expansions
ϑ(t) = 1 + O(t−N)
as t →∞
and ϑ(t) = t−1/2 + O(tN) as t →0, where N > 0 is arbitrary. It follows from the
results of Sect. 6.7.1 that its Mellin transform ˜ϑ(s) has a meromorphic extension
to all s with simple poles of residue 1 and −1 at s = 1/2 and s = 0, respectively,
and no other poles. From the formula ζ∗(s) = 1
2 ˜ϑ(s/2) we deduce that the function
ζ∗(s) deﬁned in (6.43) is meromorphic having simple poles of residue 1 and
0
at s = 1 and s = 0 and no other poles and hence (using once again that Γ(s)
has simple poles at non-positive integers and never vanishes) that ζ(s) itself is
holomorphic except for a single pole of residue 1 at s = 1 and vanishes at negative
even arguments s = −2, −4, . . . . This is weaker than (6.40), which gives a formula
for ζ(s) at all non-positive arguments (and also shows the vanishing at negative
even integers because it is an exercise to deduce from the deﬁnition (6.38) that
Br vanishes for odd r > 1). The advantage of the second approach to ζ(s) is that
from equation (6.44) and the properties of Mellin transforms listed in (6.32) we
immediately deduce the famous functional equation
ζ∗(s) = ζ∗(1 −s)
(6.46)
of the Riemann zeta-function which was discovered (for integer values ̸= 0, 1 of s)
by Euler in 1749 and proved (for all complex values ̸= 0, 1 of s) by Riemann in
1859 by just this argument.
19 To prove this, note that the function F(x) = P
n∈Z f(n + x) is periodic with
period 1, so has a Fourier expansion F(x) = P
m∈Z cme2πimx with the Fourier
coeﬃcients cm =
R 1
0 F(x)e−2πimxdx = ˆf(−m). Now set x = 0.

6.7 The Mellin Transformation and Other Useful Analytic Techniques
311
We next generalize the method of Example 3. Consider a generalized Dirichlet
series
L(s) =
∞
X
m=1
cm λ −s
m
(6.47)
where the λm are real numbers satisfying 0 < λ1 < λ2 < · · · and growing at least
as fast as some positive power of m. (This is an ordinary Dirichlet series if λm = m
for all m.) Assume that the series converges for at least one value s0 of s. Then
it automatically converges in a half-plane (for instance, if λm = m then the fact
that cm = O(ms0) implies convergence in the half-plane ℜ(s) > ℜ(s0) + 1) and the
associated exponential series
ϕ(t) =
∞
X
m=1
cm e−λmt
(t > 0)
(6.48)
converges for all positive values of t. We then have:
Proposition 6.4 Let L(s) be a generalized Dirichlet series as in (6.47), convergent
somewhere, and assume that the function ϕ(t) deﬁned by (6.48) has an asymptotic
expansion of the form
ϕ(t) ∼
∞
X
n=−1
an tn
(t →+0).
(6.49)
Then L(s) has a meromorphic continuation to all s, with a simple pole of residue
a−1 at s = 1 and no other singularities, and its values at non-positive integers are
given by
L(−n) = (−1)n n! an
(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) .
(6.50)
Proof. The function ϕ(t) is of rapid decay at inﬁnity and has the asymptotic
expansion (6.49) at zero, so by the results of Sect. 6.7.1 we know that its Mellin
transform ˜ϕ(s) extends meromorphically to all s, with simple poles of residue an
at s = −n (n = −1, 0, 1, . . . ). On the other hand, ˜ϕ(s) is equal to Γ(s)L(s) by
formula (6.37), and we know that Γ(s) has simple poles of residue (−1)nn! at
s = −n (n = 0, 1, . . . ), has no other zeros or poles, and equals 1 at s = 1. The
result follows.

L4(s) := 1
1s −1

et + e−t =

(geometric series). The asymptotic expansion of this function at t = 0 has the form

where the coeﬃcients E0 = 1, E1 = 0, E2 = −1, . . . are certain integers called
the Euler numbers. It follows from the proposition that the function L4(s) has a

312
6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
holomorphic continuation to all s and that L4(−n) = En/2 for all n ≥0. (We can
omit the factor (−1)n because En = 0 for n odd.) The same method works for
any Dirichlet series of the form P∞
m=1 χ(m)m−s with coeﬃcients χ(m) which are
periodic of some period (here 4), the most important case being that of Dirichlet
L-series, where the coeﬃcients χ(m) also satisfy χ(m1m2) = χ(m1)χ(m2) for all
m1 and m2.

6.7.3 Application: the Casimir Eﬀect
In the study of the Casimir eﬀect, described in Sect. 6.6, one encounters the “func-
tion” deﬁned by the series
F(λ) = −2π
X
l, m, n∈Z
p
l2 + m2 + λ2n2
(6.56)
where λ is a positive real variable. (Here the factor −2π has been included for
later convenience.) Of course this series is divergent. One would like to answer the
following questions:
A. How can F(λ) be deﬁned rigorously?
B. How can F(λ) be computed eﬀectively for a given λ > 0 ?
C. How does F(λ) behave asymptotically as λ →0 and as λ →∞?
(For the analysis of the Casimir eﬀect, it is the asymptotics at λ →∞which are
important.) Using the ideas explained in the previous two sections, we will show
that the answers are as follows:
A. Let λ > 0. For complex s with ℜ(s) > 3
2, deﬁne
Z(λ, s) :=
X′
l, m, n∈Z
1
(l2 + m2 + λ2n2)s
(6.57)
(the prime on the summation sign means that the term (l, m, n) = (0, 0, 0) is to
be omitted), a so-called Epstein zeta function. Then Z(λ, s) has a meromorphic

poles, and satisﬁes the functional equation

(6.58)
where
Z∗(λ, s) := π−s Γ(s) Z(λ, s) .
(6.59)
Then one makes sense of (6.56) by setting F(λ) = Z∗(λ, −1

respectively. Since both γ−1
2 (x) and γ2(x) are O(e−x) as x →∞, formula (6.60)
makes F(λ) rapidly computable. More precisely, if we choose T = λ−2/3 then there
are (uniformly in λ) only O(M 3/2) terms in the two sums in (6.60) for which the
arguments of γ−1
2
or γ2 are ≤M, so that a relatively small number of terms suﬃces
to compute F(λ) to high precision. Here are some sample values:

(6.63)
Each of these numbers was computed independently using (6.60) for several diﬀerent
values of T. The fact that the answers agreed to the precision given, even though
the individual terms of the sums are completely diﬀerent, gives a high degree of
conﬁdence in the correctness of the theoretical and numerical calculations.
20 Note that π1/2 Γ(−1
2) = −2π.

6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
Of course we could also use the functional equation (6.58) to give a much simpler
convergent series expansion for F(λ) than (6.60), namely

but this formula would be useless for practical purposes because of the slow con-
vergence: summing over |l|, |m|, |n| ≤N involves O(N 3) terms and gives an error
of the order of 1/N, so that we would need some 1010 terms to achieve even three
digits of precision.

F(λ) = 2C

the ﬁrst two terms in equations (6.65) or (6.66), respectively, are

extremely close to the exact values for these two numbers given above. Let us now
prove each of these assertions.
Proof of A. From (6.37) and the fact that the generalized Mellin transform of
the constant function 1 vanishes, we deduce that the function Z∗(λ, s) deﬁned by
(6.59) equals the Mellin transform ˜ϕλ(s) of the function
ϕλ(t) :=
X
l, m, n∈Z
e−π(l2+m2+λ2n2)t = ϑ(t)2 ϑ(λ2t)
(λ, t > 0) ,
where ϑ(t) is the theta series deﬁned in (6.41). The functional equation (6.44) of
ϑ(t) implies the functional equation ϕλ(t) = λ−1t−3/2ϕ1/λ(t−1) of ϕλ(t), and the
meromorphic continuation, description of poles and functional equation (6.58) of
Z∗(s) then follow as in Example 4 above.
Proof of B. Since the function ϕ(t) = ϕλ(t) equals 1 to all orders in t as t →∞
and (by virtue of its functional equation) equals λ−1t−3/2 to all orders in t as t →0,
the two pieces of the decomposition (6.35) of its Mellin transform are given by
˜ϕλ,≥T (s) =

respectively. Using the functional equation of ϕλ(t), we see that these are exchanged
when we replace λ, s and T by λ−1,

2 −s and T −1, respectively (again making

the functional equation of Z∗(λ, s) = ˜ϕλ(s) evident), so we only have to study
˜ϕλ,≥T (s). Substituting the deﬁnition of ϕλ(t) into (6.67), we ﬁnd
˜ϕλ,≥T (s) = T s X

The extra term −T s/s in this formula can be omitted if we drop the prime from
the summation signs and deﬁne the value of γs(0) as −1/s (which is indeed the
limiting value of γs(x) as x →0 if ℜ(s) < 1). The ﬁnal result, with this convention
for γs(0), is therefore
Z∗(λ, s) = T s X

The special case s = −1
2 gives the expansion (6.60).
Proof of C. The leading term in the expansion of F(λ) when λ is very big or very
small can be obtained from equation (6.64): if λ is small then the dominating terms
in (6.64) are those with n = 0, so F(λ) is asymptotically equal to
π−2λ−1X
l,m
′(l2 + m2)−2 = 4π−2ζ(2)L4(2)λ−1
(here we have used that
1
4
P′
l,m(l2 + m2)−s is the Dedekind zeta function of the
ﬁeld Q(i), which factors as ζ(s) times L4(s)), while for large λ the dominating terms
are those with l = m = 0 and we get F(λ) ∼2π−2ζ(4)λ3. To get a more precise
estimate, we use equation (6.60).
Consider ﬁrst the case λ →0, and choose T in (6.60) so that T →∞, λ2T →0.
(The best choice will turn out to be T = λ−1.) Then in view of the exponential
decay γs(x) = Os(x−1e−πx) of γs(x) when x →∞, we ﬁnd that the only terms in
(6.60) which are not exponentially small are those with (l, m) = (0, 0) in the ﬁrst
sum and those with n = 0 in the second one. Hence

(Note how the two non-exponentially small terms which depend on T cancel, as

for ε small, the non-exponentially small terms which depend on T again cancel,
and taking T = 1/λ to make the error as small as possible we obtain (6.66). The
details are left to the reader.
As a ﬁnal comment, we mention that the constants C and C′ occurring in (6.65)
and (6.66) can be evaluated rapidly by the same method as in B above, with ϑ(t)2
instead of ϑ(t)2ϑ(λt), using the fact that the Dirichlet series 4ζ(s)L4(s) is the Mellin
transform of ϑ(t)2. Their numerical values are

6.7.4 Asymptotics of Series of the Form  f(nt)
In this section we describe an extremely useful, and not suﬃciently well known,
asymptotic formula for functions given by expansions of the form
g(x) = f(x) + f(2x) + f(3x) + · · ·
(6.69)
where f : ]0, ∞[→C is a smooth function of suﬃciently rapid decay to ensure the
convergence of the series (say f(x) = O(x−1−ε) as x →∞) and having a known
asymptotic expansion at x = 0. In the simplest situation, we assume that f has a
power series expansion (which may be only asymptotic rather than convergent, i.e.
f need only be diﬀerentiable rather than analytic at the origin)
f(x) ∼
∞
X
n=0
bn xn
(x →0) .
(6.70)
First, let us try to guess what the answer should be. On the one hand we can
argue `a la Euler, simply substituting the expansion (6.70) into (6.69) and inter-
changing the order of summation, without worrying about convergence problems.
This gives
g(x) ∼

(6.71)
Of course this calculation is meaningless, since not only is the interchange of summa-
tion not permitted, but each of the interior sums P
m mn is divergent. Nevertheless,
we know from Sect. 6.7.2, and Euler knew non-rigorously in 1749, that the numbers
ζ(−n) do make sense and are certain rational numbers given by equation (6.40),
so that at least the ﬁnal expression in (6.71) makes sense as a formal power series.
Alternatively, we can proceed `a la Riemann and consider (6.69) for x small as 1/x
times an approximation to the integral
If =
Z ∞
0
f(t) dt .
(6.72)
This suggests instead that the correct asymptotic expansion of g(x) near 0 should
be given by

318
6. Many-Particle Systems in Mathematics and Physics
g(x) ∼If
x
(x →0) ,
(6.73)
and indeed this formula is true, by the very deﬁnition of Riemann integrals as limits
of sums, if we interpret the symbol of asymptotic equality “ ∼” in its weak sense,
as saying simply that the ratio of the expressions on its left and right tends to 1 as
x →0. However, we are using “ ∼” in its strong sense, where g(x) ∼P
λ aλxλ means
that the diﬀerence between g(x) and the ﬁnite sum P
λ<C aλxλ is O(xC) as x →0
for any value of C, no matter how large. In this stronger sense, neither (6.71) nor
(6.73) gives the correct asymptotic development of g. Remarkably enough, however,
their sum does give the right answer:
Proposition 6.5 Let f be a smooth function on the positive real line which has
the asymptotic development (6.70) at the origin and, together with all its deriva-
tives, is of rapid decay at inﬁnity. Then the function g(x) deﬁned by (6.69) has the
asymptotic development
g(x) ∼If
x +

n=0
bn Bn+1
n + 1 (−x)n
(6.74)
as x →0, where If is deﬁned by equation (6.72).
Proof. We begin by describing the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. To state
it, we need the Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x), which can be described by the gener-
ating function (6.54), by the explicit formula (6.55) in terms of Bernoulli numbers,
or, most beautiful, by the property that
Z a+1
a
Bn(x)dx = an
for every a.
(It is easy to see that there is only one polynomial Bn(x) with this property for each
n.) From any of these deﬁnitions we can deduce without diﬃculty that B′
n(x) =
nBn−1(x) and that Bn(x + 1) −Bn(x) = nxn−1.
Now let f be a smooth function on the positive reals. Integration by parts and
the fact that B1(0) = 1
2 = −B1(0) but Bn+1(1) = Bn+1(0) = Bn+1 for n ≥2 gives

the desired asymptotic formula (6.74).

where a > 0. Here the “Riemann Ansatz” and the “Euler Ansatz” predict Ifx−1

answer is the sum of these two:

(cf. equation (6.55)). The proof is similar to that of Prop. 6.5 and will be omitted.
By taking rational values of a in (6.76) and forming suitable linear combinations,
we can use this formula to give the asymptotic development of P
m≥1 χ(m)f(mx)
as x →0 for any periodic function χ(m), such as a Dirichlet character.
2. Next, we can allow non-integral exponents of x in (6.70). If the expansion
of f(x) at the origin contains terms bλxλ with arbitrary real numbers λ > −1 (or
complex numbers with real part greater than −1), then the formula for g need only
be modiﬁed by adding the corresponding terms bλζ(−λ)xλ. Terms with λ < −1

are not interesting since they can simply be subtracted from f(x), since the sum
P
m bm(mx)λ then converges absolutely. The limiting case λ = −1 is of interest
because it occurs in various applications. Here the answer (proved most easily by
taking one function, like x−1e−x, which has a 1/x singularity at the origin and for
which P f(mx) can be computed exactly) is

Here, we introduce the following integral I∗

3. Finally, we can also allow terms of the form xλ(ln x)n in the expansion of
f(x), the corresponding contribution to g(x) being simply the nth derivative with
respect to λ of ζ(−λ)xλ, e.g. a term xλ ln 1

We end by giving two easy and two harder examples to illustrate how these
asymptotic formulas work.
Example 1. Take f(x) := e−λx with λ > 0. This function is smooth, small at
inﬁnity, and has an expansion (6.70) at x = 0 with bn = (−λ)n/n! . The integral If
equals 1/λ. Hence (6.74) gives

deﬁnition (6.38) of the Bernoulli numbers.
Example 2. Now take f(x) := e−λx2 with λ > 0. This function is again smooth
and small at inﬁnity, and has an expansion (6.70) at x = 0 with b2n = (−λ)n/n!
and bn = 0 for n odd. Since all Bernoulli numbers with odd indices > 1 vanish, the
asymptotic expansion in (6.74) breaks oﬀafter two terms, and we ﬁnd
g(x) = If
x −1
2 + O(xN)
for all N, with If =
p
π/4λ. In this case, of course, we know much more, because
g(x) is simply

`
ϑ(πx2) −1
´
and therefore equation (6.44) gives the much more
precise statement
g(x) = If
x −1
2 + O
“
x−1e−π2/λx2”
.
The same applies to any function f(x) whose expansion at x = 0 has only even
powers of x. For such a function, the expansion (6.74) collapses to

as x →0, but this is always just a weakening of the Poisson summation formula
(6.45), because we can extend f(x) by f(−x) = f(x) to a smooth even function on
the real line and use (6.46) to get the exact formula
2g(x) + f(0) =

and the smoothness of f implies that the function ˆf(y) decays at inﬁnity more
rapidly than any negative power of y. The right way to think of Prop. 6.5 is therefore
as a replacement for the Poisson summation formula when one is confronted with
a sum over only positive integers rather than a sum over all of Z. Such sums are
very much harder to study than sums over all integers – just think of the special
values of the Riemann zeta function, where the numbers ζ(2k) can be obtained in
closed form because they can be written as
ζ(2k) = 1

X
n∈Z

while the numbers ζ(2k + 1), which cannot be reduced to sums over all of Z in this
way, are not known exactly.
Example 3. As our next example, we consider the function
gk(q) :=
∞
X
n=1
σk−1(n) qn
(0 < q < 1) ,
where k is an integer greater than 1 and σk−1(n) denotes the sum of the (k −1)st
powers of the divisors of a natural number n. In the theory of modular forms, it is
shown that if k is even and larger than 2, then gk satisﬁes the functional equation22

In particular, gk(e−2πx) has the terminating asymptotic expansion
gk(e−2πx) = −(−1)k/2 Bk

as x →0 in these cases. Let us see how Prop. 6.5 permits us to recover this
asymptotic formula without knowing the modularity, and at the same time tells us
why (6.79) fails for k = 2 or k odd and what replaces it in those cases.
We ﬁrst note that

since r and r + k −1 have opposite parity and all odd-index Bernoulli numbers
except B1 are zero. Therefore only two terms of (6.80) survive, and replacing x by
2πx and using the well-known formula for ζ(k) in terms of Bk, we recover (6.79).
If k = 2, then the argument is the same except that now the r = 0 term also gives
a non-zero contribution, so that we ﬁnd

Finally, if k is odd then we still get an explicit asymptotic formula with rational
coeﬃcients, but it now no longer terminates. Thus for k = 3 we ﬁnd the expansion

as x →0, even though gk has no modularity properties in this case. We leave it
as an exercise to the reader to calculate the corresponding expansion when k = 1,
where one has to use equation (6.77) instead of equation (6.74).
Example 4. As our ﬁnal example, consider the function
P(q) =

Y

the generating power series of the partition function. To study the behavior of the
partition function, we need to know how P(q) blows up as q approaches 1 from
below (or, more generally, any root of unity from within the unit circle). Here
again the known modularity properties of the function P(q) imply the non-trivial
functional equation

To obtain this formula without knowing anything about the modularity of P, we
observe that ln P
`

has the form P∞
m=1 f(mx) with f(x) = −ln(1 −e−x). This
function is small at inﬁnity, has integral If = ζ(2) (as one sees by integrating by
parts once and then calculating as in Example 2), and has an asymptotic develop-
ment

Again all terms except for the ﬁrst in the sum on the right vanish because n and
n+1 have opposite parity, and replacing x by 2πx and using ζ(2) = π2/6 we recover
(6.81). The same method using (6.76) with rational values of a lets us compute the
exact asymptotics of P(q) as q approaches any root of unity, recovering precisely
the same result as that given by the modularity. Moreover, just as in the case of
Example 2 for k odd, the method applies even when modularity fails. For example,
if we deﬁne
P2(q) =

Y

a generating function that occurs in connection with the theory of plane partitions,
then an analysis like the one just given for P(q), but now with f(x) = −x ln(1−e−x),
produces the complete asymptotic expansion

with c = eζ′(−1) = 0.847536694 · · · , and using (6.78) one can get the expansion of
P2(αe−x) for any root of unity α. Furthermore, for reasons similar to those which
applied to gk with k even, one ﬁnds that the corresponding expansions for the
logarithm of P3(q) = Q(1−qn)−n2 when q tends to a root of unity are terminating,
even though there are no modularity properties in this case.

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic
Formulas of Quantum Field Theory
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
The important things in the world appear as invariants. . . The things we
are immediately aware of are the relations of these invariants to a certain
frame of reference. . . The growth of the use of transformation theory, as
applied ﬁrst to relativity and later to the quantum theory, is the essence
of the new method in theoretical physics.
Paul Dirac, 19301
St. John’s College, Cambridge, England
This chapter is completely elementary, but it is very important for under-
standing both the basic ideas behind quantum ﬁeld theory and the language
used by physicists. Mathematicians should note that we introduce two crucial
tools which are not mentioned in the standard literature on ﬁnite-dimensional
linear algebra, namely,
• the Dirac calculus and
• discrete path integrals (functional integrals).
These tools are also very useful for mathematics itself.
7.1 Geometrization of Physics
In his 1915 theory of general relativity, Einstein described observers by local
coordinate systems. However, since physics has to be independent of the
choice of observers, physical quantities like the gravitational force have to
be described by geometric objects which do not depend on the choice of the
observer. In the late 1920s, Dirac tried to translate this general philosophy
to quantum mechanics. To this end, he invented his transformation theory
in the setting of Hilbert spaces. More precisely, as we will show in Sect.
12.2, one needs the concept of a rigged Hilbert space or Gelfand triplet.
This is intimately related to Laurent Schwartz’s theory of distributions which
generalizes the Newton–Leibniz calculus. Summarizing, modern theoretical
physics is based on the following concept:

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
physical quantities (observables) and states
⇒invariant geometric objects;
observers ⇒coordinate systems.
This underlines the importance of geometry for modern physics and the use-
fulness of abstract mathematical notions for describing physical quantities.
In quantum physics, one has to use the geometry of Hilbert spaces.
7.2 Ariadne’s Thread in Quantum Field Theory
Quantum ﬁeld theory is based on the following tools:
• Fourier series (7.17) and Dirac calculus (7.20);
• the Fourier representation of the Green’s operator (7.28);
• the Laplace transform of the Green’s operator (7.30);
• the Dyson series for the Feynman propagator (7.51).
The magic formulas of quantum ﬁeld theory. The following three
magic formulas lie at the heart of quantum ﬁeld theory:
(i) the magic Dyson perturbation formula for the S-matrix (Sect. 7.18);
(ii) the magic Feynman propagator formula and the Feynman kernel in terms
of discrete path integrals (Sect. 7.21.1);
(iii) the magic Gell-Mann–Low formula for perturbed causal correlation func-
tions (Sect. 7.22.2).
Furthermore, the magic Gell-Mann–Low formula is closely related to the
magic Feynman formula for time-ordered products (Sect. 7.21.2) and the
Wick rotation trick for vacuum expectation values (Sect. 7.22.1).
Basic strategy. These formulas are used by physicists in a formal manner
for inﬁnite-dimensional systems. There is a lack of rigorous justiﬁcation. Our
strategy is the following one:
(F) Rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional approach: We prove the magic formulas rig-
orously in ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, we introduce a
rigorous discrete Feynman path integral. This will be done in the present
chapter.
(I) Formal inﬁnite-dimensional approach: We translate straightforwardly the
rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional formulas to inﬁnite dimensions in a formal
manner. This will be done in
• Chapter 14 (response approach) and
• Chapter 15 (operator approach).
This way, a mathematician should learn quickly the background of the formu-
las used by physicists in quantum ﬁeld theory. The most important quantities
read as follows:

7.2 Ariadne’s Thread in Quantum Field Theory
327
• transition amplitude ⟨ϕ|Aψ⟩for the observable A;
• transition probability |⟨ϕ|Aψ⟩|2;
• transition amplitude for the propagator,
⟨ϕ|e−iHt/ℏϕ0⟩,
describing the dynamics of the quantum system in terms of the crucial
Hamiltonian H (energy operator);
• ground state expectation value ⟨0|A|0⟩(also called vacuum expectation
value for the observable A);2
• causal correlation coeﬃcient
⟨0|A(t)B(s)|0⟩
with the time ordering t > s (also called 2-point Green’s function) describ-
ing the correlations between two observables A and B at diﬀerent time
points t and s;
• higher causal correlation coeﬃcient
⟨0|A1(t1)A2(t2) · · · An(tn)|0⟩
with the time ordering t1 > t2 > · · · > tn (also called n-point Green’s
function);
• the singularities of the Green’s operator which correspond to the rest en-
ergies (and hence the rest masses) of the bound states.
The advantage of Feynman’s approach to quantum ﬁeld theory is the fact
that both the transition amplitudes and the causal correlation functions can
be represented by functional integrals which only depend on the classical
action that appears in the principle of critical action.
Resonances and renormalization. In quantum ﬁeld theory, a crucial
role is played by the methods of renormalization theory. In Sect. 8.1, we will
discuss the basic ideas of renormalization.
Using a simple rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional model, we will show that
the phenomenon of renormalization is related to resonances which
can be treated rigorously in terms of bifurcation theory.
The point is that in the resonance case, naive perturbation theory fails com-
pletely; it has to be replaced by a more sophisticated approach.
The challenge for mathematics. The reader should note that physi-
cists successfully use the formal inﬁnite-dimensional methods in order to pre-
dict experimental data with extremely high precision.
2 Note that the ground state |0⟩refers either to the state |E1⟩of least energy of
the full system described by the perturbed Hamiltonian H = H0 + V or to the
ground state |E0
1⟩of the unperturbed (or free) Hamiltonian H0. In the following,
we will clearly distinguish between the two cases.

328
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
From the mathematical point of view, the main problem is to justify
the passage from ﬁnite to inﬁnite dimensions for quantities which can
be measured in physical experiments.
The study of the appropriate limits represents an important mathematical
task for the future.
7.3 Linear Spaces
Functional analysis uses linear spaces and equips them with additional struc-
tures. This way, algebra, analysis, and geometry are combined with each
other. Physical systems with a ﬁnite (resp. inﬁnite) number of degrees of free-
dom are described by ﬁnite-dimensional (resp. inﬁnite-dimensional) spaces.
The real, N-dimensional, linear space RN. By deﬁnition, the space
RN consists of all the column matrices
x =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
x1
...
xN
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
(7.1)
where x1, . . . , xN are real numbers.
The complex, N-dimensional, linear space CN. By deﬁnition, the
space CN consists of all the column matrices
ψ =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ψ1
...
ψN
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
(7.2)
where ψ1, . . . , ψN are complex numbers. In particular, the zero vector 0 is
obtained by setting ψj = 0 for j = 1, . . . , N. The space CN is the prototype
of a complex linear space. Let us discuss this. To begin with, for all ϕ, ψ ∈CN
and all complex numbers α, β, we introduce the linear combination αϕ + βψ
by setting
α
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ϕ1
...
ϕN
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠+ β
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ψ1

ψN
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠:=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
αϕ1 + βψ1
...
αϕN + βψN
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠.
These linear combinations satisfy the following quite natural rules:
(L1) (ϕ + ψ) + χ = ϕ + (ψ + χ) (associative law);
(L2) ϕ + ψ = ψ + ϕ (commutative law);
(L3) ϕ + 0 = ϕ (zero element);

7.3 Linear Spaces
329
(L4) (α + β)ϕ = αϕ + βϕ and α(ϕ + ψ) = αϕ + αψ (distributive laws);
(L5) α(βϕ) = (αβ)ϕ (associative law);
(L6) αϕ = ϕ if α = 1 (normalization);
(L7) αϕ = 0 if α = 0.
For N = 2, the two elements
e1 :=

1
0

,
e2 :=

0


form a basis of the space C2. That is, for all ψ ∈C2,
ψ = ψ1e1 + ψ2e2.
A linear operator A : C2 →C2 is given by the matrix equation Aψ = ϕ which
reads explicitly as

a11 a12
a21 a22
 
ψ1
ψ2

=

ϕ1
ϕ2

with complex entries. Equivalently, this stands for the system
a11ψ1 + a12ψ2 = ϕ1,
a21ψ1 + a22ψ2 = ϕ2.
This can be generalized immediately to the spaces CN for N = 1, 2, 3, . . .
Complex linear space. A set X is called a complex linear space iﬀit
contains a distinguished element 0 and for all ϕ, ψ ∈X and all complex
numbers α, β, the linear combination
αϕ + βψ
is deﬁned in such a way that the rules (L1) through (L7) above are satisﬁed.3
A subset L of X is called a linear subspace of X iﬀϕ, ψ ∈L implies
αϕ + βψ ∈L for all complex numbers α, β.
Linear hull. Let S be a subset of the complex linear space X. By def-
inition, the linear hull, spanS, is the smallest linear subspace of X which
contains the set S. Explicitly, the set span S consists of all possible ﬁnite
linear combinations
α1ψ1 + . . . + αnψn,
n = 1, 2, . . .
where ψj ∈S and αj ∈C for all j = 1, . . . , n. Analogously, we deﬁne the
linear hull of a subset of a real linear space.
3 To simplify notation, in what follows we will write 0 instead of 0. This cannot
lead to any mistakes.

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Morphisms and isomorphisms in modern mathematics. In this
monograph, we will encounter many mathematical structures, for example,
linear spaces, Hilbert spaces, groups, algebras, topological spaces, manifolds,
and so on. Typical maps are called morphisms; they preserve the structure
under consideration. Isomorphic structures are always characterized by iso-
morphisms. Let us explain this for linear spaces. Note that
The deﬁnitions of the standard notions “surjective, injective, and
bijective” can be found in the Appendix on page 931.
Linear morphisms. Linear spaces are characterized by the linear struc-
ture based on linear combinations. Linear morphisms preserve linear struc-
ture. Explicitly, let X and Y be complex linear spaces. By a linear morphism
(or a linear operator) A : X →Y we understand a map which preserves
linear combinations, that is,
A(αϕ + βψ) = αAϕ + βAψ
for all ϕ, ψ ∈X and all complex numbers α, β.
Isomorphic linear spaces. By a linear isomorphism, we understand a
linear morphism A : X →Y which is bijective. Two complex linear spaces
X and Y are said to be isomorphic iﬀthere exists a linear isomorphism
A : X →Y.
Dimension. Let N = 1, 2, . . . By deﬁnition, the elements ϕ1, . . . , ϕN
form a basis of the complex linear space X iﬀeach element ψ in X can be
represented by the linear combination
ψ = c1ϕ1 + . . . + cNϕN
in such a way that the complex numbers c1, . . . , cN are uniquely determined
by ψ. The complex numbers c1, . . . , cN are called the coordinates of ψ with
respect to the basis ϕ1, . . . , ϕN. The main theorem on linear spaces reads as
follows.
Theorem 7.1 If a complex linear space has a ﬁnite basis, then every basis
has the same number of elements.
The number of basis elements is called the dimension of the linear space X;
the dimension is denoted by dim X. For the trivial linear space {0} which only
contains the zero element, we deﬁne dim{0} = 0. By an inﬁnite-dimensional
linear space X, we understand a nontrivial linear space which does not have
any ﬁnite basis. We write dim X = ∞.
The proof of Theorem 7.1 can be found in all textbooks on linear algebra.
We recommend A. Kostrikin and Yu. Manin, Linear Algebra and Geometry,
Springer, New York, 1989. This book emphasizes the relations to modern
physics.

7.3 Linear Spaces
331
Each complex linear space X of ﬁnite dimension N is linearly iso-
morphic to the space CN.
To prove this, choose a ﬁxed basis ϕ1, . . . , ϕN in X. For each element ϕ of
X, we have
ϕ = c1ϕ1 + . . . + cNϕN
where the complex numbers c1, . . . , cN are uniquely determined by ϕ. The
map
ϕ →(c1, . . . , cN)
is the desired linear isomorphism from the space X onto the space CN. This
shows that ﬁnite-dimensional complex linear spaces possess only one essential
invariant, namely, the dimension.
Two ﬁnite-dimensional complex linear spaces are isomorphic iﬀthey
have the same dimension.
Examples. The space C∞(R) of smooth functions ψ : R →C forms a
complex linear space. For ﬁxed n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the space Pn of all complex
polynomials
p(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . . + anxn,
x ∈R
with complex coeﬃcients a0, a1, . . . , an represents an n-dimensional linear
subspace of C∞(R). Set pj(x) := xj. Then, the polynomials p0, p1, . . . , pn
form a basis of Pn. Let −∞< a < b < ∞. Deﬁne
(Aψ)(x) := dψ(x)
dx
,
Bψ :=
 b
a
ψ(x)dx,
(Sψ)(x) := ψ(x)2
for all x ∈R and all ψ ∈C∞(R). Then, the operators
A : C∞(R) →C∞(R),
B : C∞(R) →C
are linear operators, whereas the operator S : C∞(R) →C∞(R) is not linear.
Nonlinear operators describe interactions in physics.
Therefore, nonlinear operators play a fundamental role in physics.
Real linear space. If we only consider real linear combinations αϕ+βψ
where α and β are real numbers, then we get the notion of a linear real
space. All of the notions and results discussed for complex linear spaces above
remain valid for real linear spaces if we restrict ourselves to real coeﬃcients.
For example, the space RN is a real, N-dimensional space. Moreover, every
real N- dimensional linear space is linear isomorphic to RN.
Terminology. In what follows, the symbol K denotes either R or C. By
a linear space over K we understand a real (resp. complex) linear space iﬀ
K = R (resp. K = C).

The linear space L(X, Y ). The symbol L(X, Y ) denotes the set of all
linear operators
A : X →Y
where X and Y are linear spaces over K. Let A, B ∈L(X, Y ) and α, β ∈K.
The linear combination αA + βB is deﬁned by setting
(αA + βB)ψ := αAψ + βBψ
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
This way, the set L(X, Y ) becomes a linear space over K. We now choose
Y = X.
The algebra L(X, X). For two linear operators A, B : X →X deﬁne
the product AB by setting
(AB)ψ := A(Bψ)
for all
ψ ∈X.
The set L(X, X) becomes an algebra. For all A, B, C ∈L(X, X) and all
α, β ∈K, this means the following.
• L(X, Y ) is a linear space over K.
• (αA + βB)C = αAC + βBC and C(αA + βB) = αCA + βCB (distribu-
tivity).
• (AB)C = A(BC) (associativity).
The following simple criterion is useful.
Proposition 7.2 The linear operator A : X →X is bijective iﬀthere exist
operators B, C ∈L(X, X) such that AB = CA = I. Then, A−1 = B = C.
Proof. It follows from ABϕ = ϕ that each element ϕ of X lies in the image
of A. Hence A is surjective (see page 931).
If Aϕ = Aψ, then ϕ = CAϕ = CAψ = ψ. Therefore, A is injective.
Consequently, the operator A is bijective, and hence the inverse operator
A−1 : X →X exists with AA−1 = A−1A = I. Hence A−1 = A−1AB = B
and A−1 = CAA−1 = C.

As we will show in Volume III on quantum mathematics, operator algebras
play a fundamental role in the algebraic approach to quantum physics (e.g.,
algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory). As an introduction to this, we recommend

Linear functionals and the dual space Xd. Let X be a linear space
over K. By a linear functional on X, we understand a linear map
F : X →K.
The set L(X, K) of all linear functionals on X forms a linear space over X
which is called the dual space to the linear X. This space is also denoted by
the symbol Xd.

7.3 Linear Spaces
333
For example, the most general linear functional F : C2 →C has the form
F(ψ) = c1ψ1 + c2ψ2
for all
ψ ∈C2
where c1, c2 are ﬁxed complex numbers. Setting
F(ψ) :=
 1
0
xψ(x)dx
for all
ψ ∈C∞(R),
we get a linear functional F : C∞(R) →C on the function space C∞(R).
Multilinear functionals. Again let X be a linear spaces over K. We
speak of a bilinear map
B : X × X →K
iﬀthis map is linear in each argument. Explicitly, for all ϕ, ψ, χ ∈X and all
α, β ∈K, we have
B(αϕ + βψ, χ) = αB(ϕ, χ) + βB(ψ, χ),
B(χ, αϕ + βψ) = αB(χ, ϕ) + βB(χ, ψ).
Furthermore, B is called symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) iﬀfor all ϕ, ψ ∈X,
B(ϕ, ψ) = B(ψ, ϕ)
(resp. B(ϕ, ψ) = −B(ψ, ϕ)). If B is antisymmetric, then B(ϕ, ϕ) = 0. Simi-
larly, the map
(ϕ1, . . . , ϕm) →M(ϕ1, . . . , ϕm)
from X ×· · ·×X (m factors) to K is called m-linear iﬀit is linear with respect
to each argument. Moreover, M is called symmetric (resp. antisymmetric)
iﬀit remains unchanged (resp. changes sign) under a transposition of two
arguments.
The determinant of a linear operator. Let X be an m-dimensional
linear space over K with m = 1, 2, . . .. Let A, B : X →X be linear operators.
One can show that there exists a uniquely determined number det(A) in K
such that
M(Aϕ1, . . . , Aϕm) = det(A) · M(ϕ1, . . . , ϕm)
for all m-linear antisymmetric functionals M on X and all ϕ1, . . . , ϕm ∈X.
The so-called determinant has the following properties.
(i) det(AB) = det(A) det(B),
(ii) det(I) = 1 (identity operator),
(iii) det(A) ̸= 0 iﬀA is a linear isomorphism.
(iv) If det(A) ̸= 0, then det A−1 = (det A)−1.

334
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
For example, if the linear operator A : C2 →C2 is given by the matrix
A =

a b
c d

,
then
det(A) = ad −bc.
In fact, if we choose the basis e1, e2 of C2 introduced above, then
Ae1 = ae1 + ce2,
Ae2 = be1 + de2.
For an antisymmetric bilinear functional B, we get B(e1, e1) = B(e2, e2) = 0
and B(e1, e2) = −B(e2, e1). Hence
B(Ae1, Ae2) = (ad −bc)B(e1, e2) = det(A) · B(e1, e2).
The determinant was introduced by Leibniz (1646–1716). The general formula
can be found in (7.3) below.
Matrix elements as coordinates of a linear operator. Consider an
arbitrary linear operator A : X →X on the N-dimensional linear space X
over K where K = R, C. Let ϕ, ψ ∈X. Choose any basis e1, . . . , eN of X.
The element Aek is then a linear combination of the basis vectors e1, . . . , eN.
Explicitly,
Aek =
N

k=1
ajkej,
k = 1, . . . , N.
Consequently, it follows from ψ = N
k=1 ψkek that
Aψ =
N

j,k=1
(ajkψk)ej.
This way, we assign the matrix A := (ajk) to the operator A. The matrix
elements akj are also called the coordinates of the operator A with respect to
the basis e1, . . . , eN. If we set ϕ = Aψ, then this corresponds to the equation
ϕj =
N

k=1
ajkψk,
j = 1, . . . , N
for the corresponding coordinates of ϕ, ψ, and A.
In physics, the choice of a basis corresponds to the choice of an ob-
server who measures coordinates.
Matrix calculus. There exists a perfect correspondence between oper-
ator algebra and matrix algebra. To explain this, let A, B : X →X be two
linear operators. Moreover, let A := (aij) and B := (bij) denote the matrices
corresponding to A and B with respect to a ﬁxed basis e1, . . . , eN of X. Then
the following are met.

7.4 Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
335
(i) Linear combination: The matrix C := (cij) corresponding to the linear
combination C := αA + βB is given by
cij = αaij + βbij,
i, j = 1, . . . N
for all numbers α, β ∈K. The sum of matrices is deﬁned in such a way
that the operator equation C = αA + βB passes over to the matrix
equation C = αA + βB.
(ii) Operator product: The matrix P := (pij) corresponding to P := AB
reads as
pij =
N

s=1
aisbsj,
i, j = N.
The product of matrices is deﬁned in such a way that the operator equa-
tion P = AB passes over to the matrix equation P = AB.
(iii) Determinant: We have det A = det A, that is, the determinant det A of
the operator A is equal to the determinant of the matrix A := (aij) given
by
det A :=
N

j1,...,jN =1
a1j1a2j2 · · · aNjN εj1...jN
(7.3)
where ε12...N := 1, and this symbol is antisymmetric with respect to the
indices. For example, ε12 = −ε21 = −1 and ε11 = ε22 = 0.
The advantage of the deﬁnition of the determinant det(A) of the linear oper-
ator A, in terms of multi-linear functionals above, is that it does not depend
on the choice of any basis of the space X.
The determinant is an invariant of linear operators on ﬁnite-dimen-
sional linear spaces.
7.4 Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
For quantum physics, it is crucial to use linear spaces which are equipped ad-
ditionally with an inner product. This leads us to the notion of Hilbert space.
In 1906 Hilbert (1862–1943) introduced the space l2 in order to generalize the
classical principal axis transformation for ﬁnite-dimensional quadratic forms
to inﬁnite dimensions. By deﬁnition, the elements of l2 are inﬁnite sequences
(ψ1, ψ2, . . .) of complex numbers ψ1, ψ2, . . . such that ∞
j=1 |ψj|2 < ∞. The
space l2 becomes a complex inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space equipped with
the inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
∞

j=1
(ϕj)†ψj.

336
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
This inner product converges for all ϕ, ψ ∈l2. Motivated by the needs of
quantum mechanics, the young John von Neumann (1903–1957) introduced
the notion of an abstract Hilbert space in 1929.4 At this time, von Neumann
was Hilbert’s assistant in G¨ottingen. Hilbert’s 1906 paper founded the spec-
tral theory for bounded self-adjoint operators. Von Neumann generalized this
to unbounded self-adjoint operators. Such operators are typical for quantum
mechanics. In particular, von Neumann found out that in inﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, the domain of deﬁnition of an operator plays a crucial role.
Since two diﬀerent operators may possess the same matrix elements,
inﬁnite-dimensional matrices are not suﬃcient for the mathematics
of quantum physics.
One has to use John von Neumann’s abstract language of operators.
The N-dimensional real linear Hilbert space RN. Using the Eu-
clidean inner product
⟨x|y⟩:=
N

j=1
xjyj,
x, y ∈RN,
the space RN becomes an N-dimensional real Hilbert space.
The N-dimensional complex Hilbert space CN. The space CN be-
comes a complex N-dimensional Hilbert space if we introduce the following
inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩:=
N

j=1
(ϕj)†ψj.
(7.4)
Here, the symbol z† denotes the conjugate complex number to z.5 We also
introduce the norm of the element ψ given by
||ψ|| :=

⟨ψ|ψ⟩=
⎛
⎝
N

j=1
|ψj|2
⎞
⎠
1/2
.

nalen 102 (1929), 49–131 (in German).
5 Recall that (α+βi)† = α−βi for real numbers α and β. As a rule, mathematicians
use the modiﬁed inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
N
X
j=1
ϕj(ψj)†.
However, as we will see below, this convention does not ﬁt the elegant Dirac
calculus which is very useful for mathematics as well. Therefore, we adopt the
convention (7.4) used by physicists.

7.4 Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
337
The elements
e1 :=

1


,
e2 :=



form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C2, that is,
⟨ej|ek⟩= δjk,
j, k = 1, 2.
Recall that δjk := 1 if j = k and δjk = 0 if j ̸= k. Traditionally, δjk is called
theKronecker symbol. For
ψ =

ψ1
ψ2

,
we get ⟨e1|ψ⟩= ψ1 and ⟨e2|ψ⟩= ψ2. Hence
ψ = ⟨e1|ψ⟩e1 + ⟨e2|ψ⟩e2.
This is the prototype of a Fourier series. For all ϕ, ψ, χ ∈CN and all complex
numbers α, β, the inner product satisﬁes the following conditions:
(P1) ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩is a complex number,
(P2) ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩† = ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩(antiduality),
(P3) ⟨ψ|ψ⟩> 0 if ψ ̸= 0, and ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 0 if ψ = 0 (deﬁniteness),
(P4) ⟨χ|αϕ + βψ⟩= α⟨χ|ϕ⟩+ β⟨χ|ψ⟩(linearity),
(P5) ⟨αϕ + βψ|χ⟩= α†⟨ϕ|χ⟩+ β†⟨ψ|χ⟩(antilinearity).
Pre-Hilbert space. By a complex pre-Hilbert X, we understand a com-
plex linear space equipped with an inner product which satisﬁes the condi-
tions (P1) through (P5) for all ϕ, ψ, χ ∈X and all complex numbers α, β.
The deﬁnition of the norm
||ψ|| :=

⟨ψ|ψ⟩
(7.6)
allows us to introduce the notion of convergence. Let ψn, ψ ∈X for the
indices n = 1, 2, . . . We write
lim
n→∞ψn = ψ
(7.7)
iﬀthe condition limn→∞||ψn −ψ|| = 0 is satisﬁed.
Hilbert space. A pre-Hilbert space is called a Hilbert space iﬀit is
complete. This means the following. A sequence (ψn) in X is called a Cauchy
sequence iﬀfor each number ε > 0, there exists an index n0(ε) such that
||ψm −ψn|| < ε
for all
m, n ≥n0(ε).
By deﬁnition, the pre-Hilbert space X is called complete iﬀeach Cauchy
sequence converges to an element of X. Summarizing, a complex Hilbert
space X is characterized by

338
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
• complex linear combinations αϕ + βψ,
• an inner product ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩, and
• the validity of the completeness condition.
Hilbert space morphism. Let X and Y be complex Hilbert spaces.
By a Hilbert space morphism (or an isometric operator) U : X →Y, we
understand a linear operator which preserves the inner product, that is,
⟨Uϕ|Uψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
(7.8)
Isomorphic Hilbert spaces. Bijective Hilbert space morphisms are
called Hilbert space isomorphisms. Explicitly, the operator U : X →Y is
called a Hilbert space isomorphism (or a unitary operator) iﬀit is linear,
bijective, and there holds relation (7.8). By deﬁnition, the Hilbert X is iso-
morphic (or unitarily equivalent) to the Hilbert space Y iﬀa Hilbert space
isomorphism U : X →Y exists. Intuitively, isomorphic Hilbert spaces de-
scribe the same physics.
Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It can be shown that every ﬁnite-
dimensional pre-Hilbert space is complete, and hence it is a Hilbert space.
This is not true anymore for inﬁnite-dimensional pre-Hilbert spaces, as we
will discuss in Sect. 10.2.
An N-dimensional complex (resp. real) Hilbert space is isomorphic
to the Hilbert space CN (resp. RN).
The Schwarz inequality. The most important inequality which is valid
in a Hilbert space is the Schwarz inequality.6 For example, we will show
in Sect. 10.1 that this inequality implies Heisenberg’s famous uncertainty
principle in quantum physics.
Theorem 7.3 For all elements ϕ and ψ of a pre-Hilbert space, we have the
Schwarz inequality
|⟨ϕ|ψ⟩| ≤||ϕ|| · ||ψ||.
Proof. Let ψ ̸= 0. For all complex numbers α, 0 ≤⟨ϕ −αψ|ϕ −αψ⟩. Hence
0 ≤⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩−α⟨ϕ|ψ⟩−α†{⟨ψ|ϕ⟩−α⟨ψ|ψ⟩}.
Finally, choose α := ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩.
2
The triangle inequality. For all elements ϕ, ψ, χ of a pre-Hilbert space,
| ||ϕ|| −||ψ|| | ≤||ϕ −ψ|| ≤||ϕ|| + ||ψ||.
(7.9)
6 In the 19th century, classical variants of this inequality were discovered by several
mathematicians including Victor Bunyakovski (1804–1889), Augustin Cauchy
(1775–1857), and Amandus Schwarz (1843–1921). In the standard literature on
functional analysis, one speaks usually of the Schwarz inequality.

7.4 Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
339
Proof. Since ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩†, it follows from the Schwarz inequality that
||ϕ + ψ||2 = ⟨ϕ + ψ|ϕ + ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩+ ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩+ ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩† + ⟨ψ|ψ⟩
= ||ϕ||2 + 2ℜ(⟨ϕ|ψ⟩) + ||ψ||2
≤||ϕ||2 + 2||ϕ|| · ||ψ|| + ||ψ||2 = (||ϕ|| + ||ψ||)2.
Hence ||ϕ + ψ|| ≤||ϕ|| + ||ψ||. This implies
||ϕ|| = ||ψ + (ϕ −ψ)|| ≤||ψ|| + ||ϕ −ψ||.
Thus, ||ϕ|| −||ψ|| ≤||ϕ −ψ||. Finally, interchanging ϕ with ψ, we obtain the
inequality ±(||ϕ|| −||ψ||) ≤||ϕ −ψ||.
2
Continuity of the inner product. Suppose that ϕn →ϕ and ψn →ψ
as n →∞in a pre-Hilbert space. Then
lim
n→∞⟨ϕn|ψn⟩→⟨ϕ|ψ⟩.
(7.10)
Proof. It follows from | ||ϕn|| −||ϕ|| | ≤||ϕ −ϕn|| →0 as n →∞that the
sequence (||ϕn||) converges to ||ϕ||, and hence it is bounded. Similarly, the
sequence (||ψn||) is bounded. By the Schwarz inequality,
|⟨ϕn|ψn⟩−⟨ϕ|ψ⟩| = |⟨ϕn −ϕ|ψn⟩+ ⟨ϕ|ψn −ψ⟩|
≤|⟨ϕn −ϕ|ψn⟩| + |⟨ϕ|ψn −ψ⟩|
≤||ϕn −ϕ|| · ||ψn|| + ||ϕ|| · ||ψn −ψ|| →0 as n →∞.
This ﬁnishes the proof.
2
The continuity of the inner product implies the continuity of the norm.
Explicitly, it follows from ϕn →ϕ as n →∞in a pre-Hilbert space that
lim
n→∞||ϕn|| = ||ϕ||.
The topology of a Hilbert space. A subset O of a Hilbert space X is
called open iﬀfor each point ψ0 ∈X, there exists a number ε > 0 such that
the open ball
{ψ ∈X : ||ψ −ψ0|| < ε}
is contained in the set O. It turns out that
Each Hilbert space is a topological space.
For a subset C of a Hilbert space X, the following two conditions are equiv-
alent.
(i) The set C is closed, that is, the complement X \ C is open.
(ii) The set C is sequentially closed, that is, if ψn ∈C for all n and ψn →ψ
in X as n →∞, then ψ ∈C.
The same is true for pre-Hilbert spaces.

7.5 Groups
Groups describe symmetries in physics, whereas the linearization of sym-
metries leads to Lie algebras.
Folklore
Let X be an n-dimensional real or complex linear space with n = 1, 2, . . ..
The set GL(X) of all linear isomorphisms A : X →X is the prototype of a
group; it is called the general linear group of the space X. Set G := GL(X).
Then, for all A, B, C ∈G, the following are met.
(G1) Consistency: AB ∈G.
(G2) Associativity: (AB)C = A(BC).
(G3) Unit element: There exists a uniquely determined element I in G such
that IA = AI = A for all A ∈G.
(G4) For each A ∈G, there exists a uniquely determined element B in G
such that AB = BA = I. We write A−1 instead of B.
A set G equipped with a uniquely deﬁned product AB for all A, B ∈G is
called a group iﬀthe conditions (G1) through (G4) are satisﬁed.
Group morphism. A map χ : G →H between two groups G and H is
called a group morphism iﬀit respects products, that is,
χ(AB) = χ(A)χ(B)
for all
A, B ∈G.
A bijective (resp. surjective) group morphism χ : G →H is called group
isomorphism (resp. group epimorphism).
Subgroup. A subset S of a group G is called a subgroup iﬀit is a group
with respect to the product on G. Again let X be a complex n-dimensional
Hilbert space with n = 1, 2, . . . Then the following are true.
• Unitary group U(X): The set U(X) of all unitary operators A : X →X
forms a subgroup of GL(X).
• Special unitary group SU(X): The set of all A ∈U(X) with det(A) = 1
forms a subgroup of U(X) denoted by SU(X).
Matrix algebra. Let A = (aij) be a real or complex (n×n)-matrix with
n = 1, 2, . . . .
• The dual matrix Ad = (bij) is deﬁned by bij := aji for i, j = 1, . . . n.
• The adjoint matrix A† = (cij) is deﬁned by cij := a†
ji for i, j = 1, . . . n.
• The conjugate complex matrix Ac = (dij) is deﬁned by dij := a†
ij for
i, j = 1, . . . , n.
• The number tr(A) := n
j=1 ajj is called the trace of the matrix A. The
expression for the determinant det(A) can be found in (7.3) on page 335.
For all complex linear (n × n)-matrices A, B and all complex numbers α, β,
the following ar true:

7.5 Groups
341
• (αA + βB)† = α†A† + β†B†,
• (AB)† = B†A† and (AB)d = BdAd,
• det I = 1 and det Ad = det A,
• det(AB) = det A · det B,
• det A−1 = (det A)−1 if det A ̸= 0.
• tr(αA + βB) = α tr A + β tr B,
• tr Ad = tr A and tr A† = (tr A)†,
• tr(AB) = tr(BA),
• tr I = n.
The proofs of all the matrix rules can be found in Hein (1990).
Multiplicative matrix groups. The following groups with respect to
multiplication AB of numbers A, B or matrices will be used quite often.
(i) The group GL(1, R) consists of all nonzero real numbers. This group is
also denoted by R×.
(ii) The group R×
+ consists of all positive numbers. This is a subgroup of R×.
(iii) The group U(1) consists of all complex numbers z with |z| = 1.
(iv) The real, general linear group GL(n, R) consists of all invertible real
(n × n)-matrices.
(v) The real, special linear group SL(n, R) consists of all matrices A in
GL(n, R) with det(A) = 1.
(vi) The complex, general linear group GL(n, C) consists of all invertible
complex (n × n)-matrices.
(vii) The complex, special linear group SL(n, C) consists of all matrices A
in GL(n, C) with det(A) = 1.
(viii) The unitary group U(n) consists of all complex (n × n)-matrices with
AA† = A†A = I. Such matrices are called unitary matrices. This is a
subgroup of GL(n, C).
(ix) The special unitary group SU(n) consists of all matrices A ∈U(n) with
det A = 1.
(x) The orthogonal group O(n) consists of all real (n × n)-matrices A with
AAd = AdA = I. Such matrices are called orthogonal matrices. This is a
subgroup of GL(n, R).
(xi) The special orthogonal group SO(n) consists of all matrices A ∈O(n)
with det(A) = 1. In particular, O(1) = {1, −1} and SO(1) = {1}.
If X is a complex n-dimensional Hilbert space with n = 1, 2, . . . , then we
have the following group isomorphisms:
• U(n) = U(X), SU(n) = SU(X), GL(n, C) = GL(X), SL(n, C) = SL(X).
Similarly, if X is a real n-dimensional Hilbert space, then we have the fol-
lowing group isomorphisms:
• O(n) = U(X), SO(n) = SU(X), GL(n, R) = GL(X), SL(n, R) = SL(X).
A group is called commutative (or Abelian) iﬀAB = BA for all A, B ∈G.

342
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
• The groups (i)–(iii) above are commutative.
• If n = 1, then the groups (iv)–(xi) are commutative.
• If n ≥2, then the groups (iv)–(xi) above are not commutative.
Additive groups. The prototype of an additive group is the real line R
equipped with addition. Set A := R. Then, for all a, b, c ∈A, the following
are met.
(A1) Consistency: a + b ∈A.
(A2) Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
(A3) Commutativity: a + b = b + a.
(A4) Zero element: There exists precisely one element 0 in the set A such
that a + 0 = a for all a ∈A.
(A5) Inverse element: For each a ∈A, there exists precisely one element b
such that a + b = 0. We write (−a) instead of b.
A set A is called an additive group iﬀit is equipped with a uniquely deter-
mined addition a + b for all a, b ∈A such that the conditions (A1) through
(A5) are met. A map
χ : A →B
between two additive groups A and B is called an additive group morphism
iﬀit respects addition, that is, χ(a + b) = χ(a) + χ(b) for all a, b ∈A.
7.6 Lie Algebras
Let X be a real linear space. The prototype of a Lie algebra is the set gl(X)
of all linear operators A : X →X. Deﬁne the Lie product
[A, B] := AB −BA.
Set L := gl(X). Then, for all A, B, C ∈L and all real numbers α, β the
following are met.
(L1) Linearity: L is a real linear space.
(L2) Consistency: [A, B] ∈L.
(L3) Anticommutativity: [B, A] = −[A, B].
(L4) Bilinearity: [αA + βB, C] = α[A, C] + β[B, C].
(L5) Jacobi identity: [[A, B], C] + [[B, C], A] + [[C, A], B] = 0.
A set L is called a real Lie algebra iﬀit is equipped with a uniquely determined
Lie product [A, B] for all elements A, B of L such that conditions (L1) through
(L5) are met.7 The Lie product [A, B] is also called the Lie bracket.
7 Similarly, we speak of a complex Lie algebra L iﬀa natural modiﬁcation of (L1)
through (L5) holds true. Explicitly, we postulate that L is a complex linear space,
and condition (L4) is valid for all complex numbers α, β.

7.6 Lie Algebras
343
Lie algebra morphism. A map χ : L →M between two real (resp. com-
plex) Lie algebras is called a Lie algebra morphism iﬀit is a linear morphism
and it respects Lie products, that is,
χ([A, B]) = [χ(A), χ(B)]
for all
A, B ∈L.
Lie subalgebra. A subset S of a Lie algebra L is called a Lie subalgebra
iﬀit is a Lie algebra with respect to the Lie product on L. For example,
let X be a complex n-dimensional Hilbert space with n = 1, 2, . . . Then the
following are true.8
• Skew-adjoint operators: The set u(X) of all linear operators A : X →X
with A† = −A forms a Lie subalgebra of gl(X).
• Traceless skew-adjoint operators: The set of all A ∈u(X) with tr(A) = 0
forms a Lie subalgebra of u(X) denoted by su(n).
Classiﬁcation of morphisms. The following terminology is used in
mathematics for all kind of morphisms:
• bijective morphisms are called isomorphisms if the inverse map is also a
morphism;9
Furthermore, for linear morphisms (or group morphisms, Lie algebra mor-
phisms), we use the following convention:10
• surjective morphisms are called epimorphisms;
• injective morphisms are called monomorphisms.
For example, two groups G and H are called isomorphic iﬀthere exists a
group isomorphism χ : G →H.
Isomorphic groups and isomorphic Lie algebras describe the same
mathematics and physics.
Matrix Lie algebras. The following real Lie algebras with respect to
the Lie product [A, B] := AB −BA are frequently used.11
(i) The Lie algebra gl(n, R) consists of all real (n × n)-matrices.
(ii) The Lie algebra sl(n, R) consists of all A ∈gl(n, R) with tr(A) = 0.
(iii) The Lie algebra gl(n, C) consists of all complex (n × n)-matrices.
(iv) The Lie algebra sl(n, C) consists of all matrices A ∈gl(n, C) with van-
ishing trace, tr(A) = 0.
8 The deﬁnition of the adjoint operator A† and the trace tr(A) of the linear oper-
ator A can be found on page 357 and 363, respectively.
9 For linear isomorphisms, group isomorphisms, and Lie algebra isomorphisms, the
latter condition is satisﬁed automatically.
10 For general morphisms, the deﬁnition of epimorphisms and monomorphisms will
be given in Volume II, Chap. 3, in the setting of category theory.
11 The Lie algebras gl(n, C), sl(n, C) are also complex Lie algebras, but u(n) and
su(n) are not complex Lie algebras.

(v) The Lie algebra u(n) consists of all A ∈gl(n, C) with A† = −A. These
matrices are called skew-adjoint.
(vi) The Lie algebra su(n) consists of all complex matrices A ∈u(n) with
tr(A) = 0.
(vii) The Lie algebra o(n) consists of all A ∈gl(n, R) with Ad = −A. These
matrices are called skew-symmetric.
(viii) The Lie algebra so(n) coincides with o(n).
For example, in order to prove that su(n) is a real Lie algebra, we have to
show that the following are true.
(a) If A, B ∈su(n) and α, β ∈R, then αA + βB ∈su(n).
(b) If A, B ∈su(n), then [A, B] ∈su(n).
in fact, the claim (a) follows from
(αA + βB)† = αA† + βB† = −αA −βB.
In order to prove (b), note that
[A, B]† = (AB −BA)† = B†A† −A†B† = BA −AB = −[A, B].
In addition, tr([A, B]) = tr(AB −BA) = tr(AB) −tr(BA) = 0.
If X is a complex n-dimensional Hilbert space with n = 1, 2, . . ., then we
have the following real Lie algebra isomorphisms:
u(n) = u(X),
su(n) = su(X),
gl(n, C) = gl(X),
sl(n, C) = sl(X).
Similarly, if X is a real n-dimensional Hilbert space, then we have the fol-
lowing real Lie algebra isomorphisms:
o(n) = so(n) = u(X),
gl(n, R) = gl(X),
sl(n, R) = sl(X).
The Hilbert space gl(n, C). This space is a complex Hilbert space of
dimension n2 with respect to the inner product
⟨A|B⟩:= tr(A†B).

7.7 Lie’s Logarithmic Trick for Matrix Groups
In 1614, John Napier (1550–1617) published his book “Miriﬁci logarithmorum
canonis descriptio” where he popularized the use of logarithms. His idea was
to simplify the computation of products by reducing this to the computation
of sums. The basic rule reads as
ln(ab) = ln a + ln b
for all
a, b ∈R.
Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) used this new mathematical tool for simplifying
substantially his huge computations in celestial mechanics.
Our goal is to simplify the products of matrices in a similar manner.
This approach was invented by Sophus Lie (1842–1899) in the 1870s and lies
at the heart of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.
The exponential function. For each matrix A ∈GL(n, C), we deﬁne
eA := I + A + A2
2! + . . . =
∞

k=0
Ak
k! .
This inﬁnite series converges in the Hilbert space gl(n, C). Observe that for
all matrices A, B ∈gl(n, C), the following useful formulas are valid.
• If AB = BA, then eA+B = eAeB.12
• det(eA) = etr(A).
•

eA† = eA† and

eAd = eAd.
•

eA−1 = e−A.
• etAesA = e(t+s)A (causality relation). In other words, the set {etA : t ∈R}
is a subgroup of GL(n, C), and the map t →etA is a group morphism from
the additive group R into the group GL(n, C).
• Let ψ0 ∈Cn. The function ψ(t) := etAψ0 for all times t ∈R is the unique
solution of the diﬀerential equation
dψ(t)
dt
= Aψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(0) = ψ0.
This equation and its inﬁnite-dimensional generalizations govern the dy-
namics of many physical systems (e.g., quantum systems). If we set
A := −iH/ℏwhere H† = H, then we get the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏdψ(t)
dt
= Hψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(0) = ψ0
for the Hamiltonian H (energy operator).
12 It is crucial for quantum physics that this formula is not valid, as a rule, if
AB ̸= BA. Then, one has to use the magic Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀformula
(see page 508).

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Finally, let us comment on the causality relation. To this end, introduce
the time-dependent operator Ttψ0 := ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ0. Then the causality
relation tells us that
Ts+tψ0 = Ts(Ttψ0)
for all
t, s ≥0.
In terms of physics, this means that the following two procedures yield the
same result.
(I) Start from the initial state ψ0 and compute the state ψ(s + t) = Ts+t of
the system at the later time s + t.
(II) Compute ﬁrst the state at time ψ(t) = Ttψ0. Use this as new initial state
for computing state Tsψ(t) of the system at the later time s.
Finally, it follows from
ψ0 = T−tψ(t), t ≥0
that the state of the system at the later time t uniquely determines the initial
state of the system at time t = 0.
Summarizing, the exponential function describes the causality of
physical processes.
The logarithmic function. For all matrices A ∈gl(n, C) with ||A|| < 1,
we deﬁne
ln(I + A) := A −A2
2 + . . . =
∞

k=1

This series converges in the Hilbert space gl(n, C). There exists a small num-
ber ε > 0 such that for all matrices B, C ∈gl(n, C) with ||B −I|| < ε and
||C −I|| < ε, the following are true.
• ln(BC) = ln B + ln C,
• ln I = 0,
• (ln B)† = ln B† and (ln B)d = ln Bd,
• tr(B) = ln(det eB),
• eln A = A if ||A −I|| < 1,
• ln eA = A if ||eA −I|| < 1.
The local parametrization of the group GL(n, C). We are given the
matrix A0 ∈GL(n, C) and the number ε > 0. By an ε-neighborhood of A0
in the group GL(n, C), we understand the set
Uε(A0) := {A ∈GL(n, C) : ||A −A0|| < ε}
where the norm refers to the Hilbert space gl(n, C). In addition, the subset
U(A0) of the group GL(n, C) is called a neighborhood of A0 iﬀit contains any
ε-neighborhood Uε(A0). If we replace the group GL(n, C) by the Lie algebra
gl(n, C), then we obtain the corresponding notions for gl(n, C). The following

7.8 Lie Groups
347
theorem tells us that the group GL(n, C) can be locally parametrized by the
elements of the Lie algebra gl(n, C). This main trick of the theory of Lie
groups simpliﬁes the computations with respect to the group GL(n, C).
Theorem 7.4 The map A →ln A sends the neighborhood
{A ∈GL(n, C) : ||A −I|| < I}
of the unit element I of the group GL(n, C) bijectively onto some neighborhood
of the origin in the Lie algebra gl(n, C). The inverse map is given by B →eA.
The matrix B := ln A is called the local coordinate of the group element A
near the unit element. For an arbitrary group element A0 in GL(n, C), we
write
A = A0eB
for all
B ∈gl(n, C).
If the matrix A lies in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of A0, then the local
coordinate of A is given by B := ln(A−1
0 A). Analogously, the groups
SL(n, C), GL(n, R), SL(n, R), U(n), SU(n), O(n), SO(n)
can be locally parametrized by the matrices of the Lie algebras
sl(n, C), gl(n, R), sl(n, R), u(n), su(n), o(n), so(n),
respectively. For example, consider the case of the group SU(n). Choose a
matrix A ∈SU(n) near the unit element. It follows from AA† = I that
0 = ln I = ln A + ln A† = ln A + (ln A)†.
(7.11)
In addition, det A = 1 implies tr(ln A) = ln(det A) = 0. Hence the local
coordinate ln A is a skew-adjoint and traceless matrix which lies in the Lie
algebra su(n).
7.8 Lie Groups
Lie groups. The notion of Lie group combines the notion of group with
the notion of manifold. By deﬁnition, a ﬁnite-dimensional real manifold is
called a Lie group iﬀit is equipped with a group structure such that both
the multiplication map
(A, B) →AB
and the inversion map A →A−1 are smooth. The following theorem is merely
a reformulation of Theorem 7.4.

348
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Theorem 7.5 For n = 1, 2, . . ., the classical groups
GL(n, C), SL(n, C), GL(n, R), SL(n, R), U(n), SU(n), O(n), SO(n)
are Lie groups. The tangent space of these Lie groups at the unit element are
the Lie algebras
gl(n, C), sl(n, C), gl(n, R), sl(n, R), u(n), su(n), o(n), so(n),
respectively. Here, so(n) = o(n). The Lie groups U(n), SU(n), O(n), SO(n)
are compact subsets of Cn2.
Observe that the 2-dimensional sphere (e.g., the surface of earth) cannot be
equipped with the structure of a Lie group. However, if we identify the points
of the 3-dimensional unit sphere S3 with the unit quaternions, then the sphere
S3 becomes a Lie group with respect to the multiplication of quaternions.
Lie’s linearization principle. The tangent space of a Lie group G at
the unit element can always be equipped with the structure of a Lie algebra
which is denoted by LG.
It is crucial for the theory of Lie groups that the Lie algebra LG
knows all about the local structure of the Lie group G.
This is the famous Lie linearization principle for Lie groups which we will
encounter quite often.
Lie group morphism. Let G and H be Lie groups. By a Lie group
morphism
f : G →H
we understand a map which is both a group morphism and a manifold mor-
phism. In other words, this is a smooth group morphism. The map f : G →H
is called a Lie group isomorphism iﬀit is both a group isomorphism and a
manifold isomorphism. In other words, this is a group isomorphism which is
a diﬀeomorphism, too.
The theory of manifolds is fundamental for modern physics, as we will
see at many diﬀerent places of the volumes of this treatise. In particular, the
theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras (and their representations) is basic for
the study of symmetry phenomena in physics and mathematics.
The physical meaning of the tangent space. If we consider the mo-
tion x = x(t) of a particle on a manifold M such that the particle is at the
point x0 at time t = 0, then the velocity vector ˙x(0) lies in the tangent space
Tx0M of the manifold M at the point x0. Generally, the space Tx0M consists
of all possible velocity vectors at the point x0. As an example, consider the
group SU(n) at the point I (unit element).
(a) We show that each velocity vector at the unit element lies in the Lie
algebra su(n). To this end, consider an arbitrary smooth curve
A = A(t),
t ∈U(0)

7.9 Basic Notions in Quantum Physics
349
on the manifold SU(n) with A(0) = I. Here, U(0) is a neighborhood of
the origin on the real line. Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t at the
point t = 0 yields the velocity vector ˙A(0). Set
B(t) := ln A(t),
t ∈U(0).
Hence ˙B(0) = A(0)−1 ˙A(0) = ˙A(0). By (7.11), B(t) ∈su(n) for all times
t ∈U(0). This implies ˙B(0) ∈su(n), noting that su(n) is a linear space.
(b) We show that each vector B in su(n) is the velocity vector of a smooth
curve on SU(n) which passes through the point I. Explicitly, we choose
the curve
A(t) := etB,
t ∈R.
Then ˙A(0) = B. It remains to show that A(t) ∈SU(n) for all t ∈R. In
fact, it follows from B + B† = 0 and tr B = 0 that
A(t)A(t)† = et(B+B†) = I,
det A(t) = et tr B = 1.
Inﬁnitesimal transformations. The elements B of the Lie algebra
su(n) are called the inﬁnitesimal transformations of the Lie group SU(n).
This is motivated by the approximation
etB = I + tB + O(t2),
t →0.
(7.12)
The use of inﬁnitesimal transformations substantially simpliﬁes the investi-
gation of Lie groups. Finally, let us motivate the Lie bracket. Suppose that
B, C ∈su(n). Then e±tB, esC ∈SU(n) for all t, s ∈R. For ﬁxed s ∈R, set
A(t) := esBetCe−sB,
t ∈R.
Since SU(n) is a group, the product A(t) lies in SU(n) for all t ∈R, and
A(0) = I. By (a) above, the velocity vector
˙A(0) lies in su(n). Explicitly,
˙A(0) = esBCe−sB. Therefore,
esBCe−sB ∈su(n)
for all
s ∈R.
Diﬀerentiating this with respect to s at the point s = 0, we obtain that
BC −CB ∈su(n). This argument shows that the group property of SU(n)
implies that the tangent space su(n) of SU(n) at the point I is invariant
under the Lie bracket [B, C] := BC −CB, that is,
B, C ∈su(n)
⇒
[B, C] ∈su(n).
7.9 Basic Notions in Quantum Physics
Quantum physics is based on the study of states, costates, and observables.
Folklore
Let X and Y be complex ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of dimension N
and M, respectively, N, M = 1, 2, . . .

350
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
7.9.1 States, Costates, and Observables
States. The nonzero elements ψ of the Hilbert space X are called states in
quantum physics. Two states ψ and ϕ are said to be equivalent iﬀthere exists
a nonzero complex number µ with
ψ = µϕ.
Intuitively, equivalent states represent the same physics. The notions like
mean value, mean ﬂuctuation, and transition probability to be introduced
below are the same for equivalent states. The state ψ is called normalized iﬀ
||ψ|| = 1.
Duality and costates. By a linear functional F on the space X, we
understand a linear map F : X →C, that is,
F(αψ + βϕ) = αF(ψ) + βF(ϕ)
for all ψ, ϕ ∈X and all complex numbers α, β. By deﬁnition, the set of all
linear functionals on X forms the dual space of X denoted by Xd. Linear
functionals are called costates in quantum physics.
Observables. The operator A : X →Y is called linear iﬀ
A(αψ + βϕ) = αAψ + βAϕ
for all ψ, ϕ ∈X and all complex numbers α and β. By an observable on the
Hilbert space X, we understand a linear self-adjoint operator A : X →X,
that is, we have the symmetry property
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
Intuitively, observables are physical quantities like energy, position, momen-
tum, angular momentum (spin). It follows from
⟨ψ|Aψ⟩† = ⟨Aψ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩
that ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩is a real number for all states ψ. The real number
¯A := ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩
||ψ||2
(7.13)
is called the mean value of the observable A in the state ψ. Intuitively, this
represents the mean value of the physical quantity A (for example, energy)
measured in the state ψ. Moreover, the nonnegative mean ﬂuctuation, ∆A,
of the observable A in the state ψ is deﬁned by13
13 To simplify notation, we write ¯A instead of ¯A · I where I denotes the identity
operator.

7.9 Basic Notions in Quantum Physics
351
(∆A)2 = (A −¯A)2.
Explicitly,
(∆A)2 = ⟨ψ|(A −¯A)2ψ⟩
||ψ||2
.
(7.14)
As in the theory of probability,
(∆A)2 = A2 −¯A2.
In fact, this follows from
A2 −2 ¯AA + ¯A2 = A2 −2 ¯A ¯A + ¯A2.
Furthermore, from ⟨ψ|(A −¯A)2ψ⟩= ⟨(A −¯A)ψ|(A −¯A)ψ⟩we get
∆A = ||(A −¯A)ψ||
||ψ||
.
Eigenstates as sharp states. A state ψ is called an eigenstate of the
observable A iﬀthere exists a complex number λ such that
Aψ = λψ.
In an eigenstate ψ, the mean value is equal to the eigenvalue λ, and the mean
ﬂuctuation is equal to zero,
¯A = λ,
∆A = 0.
In fact, ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩= ⟨ψ|λψ⟩= λ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, and ||(A −λI)ψ|| = 0. In particular,
the eigenvalues of an observable are always real. Because of ∆A = 0, the
eigenstate ψ of the observable A is called a sharp state with the sharp value
λ. Let us consider two examples:
• Molecule states are eigenstates of the energy operator (Hamiltonian). The
sharp energy values are responsible for the spectrum of molecules.
• Elementary particle are eigenstates of the mass operator and the spin op-
erator. The corresponding eigenvalues represent sharp values of mass and
spin.
Transition amplitude. The complex number
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩
is called the transition amplitude from the state ϕ to the state ψ with respect
to the observable A. The real number

352
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
τ :=
|⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩|2
||ψ||2 · ||ϕ||2
is called the transition probability from the state ϕ to the state ψ with
respect to the observable A. The great importance of transition amplitudes
for quantum physics was emphasized by Feynman in the 1940s. He based
his approach to quantum mechanics, quantum statistics, and quantum ﬁeld
theory on the notion of transition amplitude. In a natural way, this leads to
path integrals for the propagators, as we will discuss in Sect. 7.21.
Correlation coeﬃcient. Let A, B : X →X be two observables. The
complex number
γ := (A −¯A)(B −¯B)
∆A · ∆B
is called the (generalized) correlation coeﬃcient for the ordered pair of ob-
servables A, B in the state ψ. There holds
γ = AB −¯A ¯B
∆A · ∆B .
This follows from (A −¯A)(B −¯B) = AB −2 ¯A ¯B + ¯A ¯B. Explicitly,
γ = ⟨ψ|(A −¯A)(B −¯B)ψ⟩
∆A · ∆B · ||ψ||2
= ⟨(A −¯A)ψ|(B −¯B)ψ⟩
∆A · ∆B · ||ψ||2
.
By the Schwarz inequality,
|γ| ≤||(A −¯A)ψ|| · ||(B −¯B)ψ||
∆A · ∆B · ||ψ||2
= 1.
Hence |γ| ≤1.
Commuting observables and the Gauss method of least squares.
Let us now consider the special case of two observables A, B : X →X which
commute, that is, AB = BA. It follows then from
⟨ψ|ABϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|Bϕ⟩= ⟨BAψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ABψ|ϕ⟩
for all ψ, ϕ ∈X that AB is again an observable. Thus, AB is a real number,
and hence the correlation coeﬃcient γ for A and B (in each state ψ) is
also a real number. In addition, −1 ≤γ ≤1. In order to get an intuitive
interpretation of the correlation coeﬃcient, consider the following minimum
problem
(B −αA −β)2 = min!,
α, β ∈R.
(7.15)
That is, by Gauss’ method of least squares, we want to optimally ﬁt the
observable B by the real linear combination αA + β. Assume that ∆A and
∆B do not vanish.

7.9 Basic Notions in Quantum Physics
353
Theorem 7.6 For given observables A and B with AB = BA, the minimum
problem (7.15) has the solution
α := γ · ∆B
∆A ,
β := ¯B −α ¯A.
The minimal value is equal to (∆B)2(1 −γ2).
Intuitively, this theorem tells us that the correlation coeﬃcient γ measures
the dependence between the physical quantities A and B.
• This dependence is optimal iﬀ
(∆B)2 · (1 −γ2) = 0,
that is, |γ| = 1. We call this strong correlation.
• The coeﬃcient γ = 0 corresponds to weak correlation.
Proof. (I) Assume ﬁrst that ¯A = ¯B = 0 and ∆A = ∆B = 1. Then γ = AB
and A2 = (∆A)2 + ¯A2 = 1. Similarly, B2 = 1. Therefore,
(B −γA)2 = B2 −2γAB + γ2A2 = 1 −γ2.
Noting that (B −γA)A = BA −γ = 0, the trick is to set
(B −αA −β)2 = ((B −γA) −(α −γ)A −β)2.
This is equal to
(B −γA)2 + (α −γ)2A2 + β2 = 1 −γ2 + (α −γ)2 + β2.
This quadratic expression is minimal if α = γ and β = 0. The minimal value
is equal to 1 −γ2. This proves the theorem in the present special case.
(II) For general mean values ¯A, ¯B, assume that ∆A = ∆B = 1. Setting
A := A −¯A and B := B −¯B, we get
(B −αA −β)2 = (B −αA −β′)2 = min!
with β′ := β −¯B + α ¯A. By (I), this problem has the solution α = γ and
β′ = 0.
(III) For general nonzero mean ﬂuctuations ∆A, ∆B, the proof can be
easily reduced to (II) by using the rescaling A →A/∆A and B →B/∆B. 2
Causal correlation functions. Let A = A(t) and B = B(t) be functions
depending on time t such that A(t), B(t) : X →X are observables for each
t ∈R. Fix the state ψ ∈X. For t > s, we set
C(t, s) := ⟨ψ|A(t)B(s)ψ⟩.
The function C is called the causal correlation function. Motivated by the
correlation coeﬃcients introduced above, we expect that the value C(t, s) of

354
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
the causal correlation function contains information about the correlation
between the observable B at time s and the observable A at the later time t,
in the state ψ. The experience of physicists is that causal correlation functions
represent an important tool in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Quantum ﬁeld theory is mainly based on the computation of causal
correlations functions which describe the correlations of the quantum
ﬁeld between diﬀerent space points at diﬀerent time points.
The causal correlation functions of a quantum ﬁeld are also called 2-point
Green’s functions and higher-order Green’s functions.
7.9.2 Observers and Coordinates
Orthogonality. Two states ψ and ϕ of the Hilbert space X are called or-
thogonal iﬀ
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= 0.
This is the most important notion in Hilbert spaces.
The geometry of Hilbert spaces and hence quantum physics are gov-
erned by orthogonality.
For example, this concerns Fourier series and Dirac calculus, as we will show
below.
Proposition 7.7 Two eigenstates of an observable A with diﬀerent eigen-
values are orthogonal.
To prove this, let Aψ = λψ and Aϕ = µϕ wit λ ̸= µ. Since the eigenvalues λ
and µ are real, (λ −µ)⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩−⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= 0. Hence ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= 0.
Fourier coeﬃcients of states. If an observer measures the state ψ by
a measurement device, then this corresponds to the decomposition
ψ = c1ϕ1 + . . . + cNϕN
(7.16)
where ϕ1, . . . , ϕN is a basis of the Hilbert space X, and c1, . . . , cN are complex
numbers. In order to get a physical interpretation of this decomposition,
assume additionally that the basis ϕ1, . . . , ϕN forms an orthonormal system,
that is, ⟨ϕj|ϕk⟩= δjk for all j, k.14 Then
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= |c1|2 + . . . + |cN|2.
Finally, assume that the state ψ is normalized, that is, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1. Then
|c1|2 + . . . + |cN|2 = 1.
This allows us to give the following interpretation:
14 For the Kronecker symbol, recall that δjk := 1 if j = k, and δjk := 0 if j ̸= k.
Here, j, k = 1, . . . N.

7.10 Fourier Series
355
• Our measurement device is able to detect the states ϕ1, . . . , ϕN.
• If the particle is in the state ψ, then |cj|2 is the probability of measuring
the state ϕj.
We call c1, . . . , cN the coordinates of the state ψ with respect to the basis
ϕ1, . . . , ϕN. Explicitly,
cj = ⟨ϕj|ψ⟩,
j = 1, . . . N.
This follows from (7.16) by using ⟨ϕk|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕk|ckϕk⟩= ck. The complex
number ck is called the Fourier coeﬃcient of the state ψ.
Matrix elements of observables. The matrix elements
ajk := ⟨ϕj|Aϕk⟩,
j, k = 1, . . . , N
are called the coordinates of the observable A with respect to the basis
ϕ1, . . . , ϕN. The Dirac calculus was invented by Dirac in the late 1920s;
it allows us to pass elegantly from one coordinate system to another one.
Dirac called this transformation theory. The Dirac calculus translates well-
known notions from linear algebra into a convenient mnemonical language.
In this monograph, we will always use Dirac’s language. To begin with, let
us formulate the relevant notions in the traditional mathematical language.
7.10 Fourier Series
Theorem 7.8 Each nontrivial ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space possesses an

This so-called Parseval equation represents the inner product in terms of
Fourier coeﬃcients.16
(iv) Duality: For each state ϕ in X, set
Fϕ(χ) := ⟨ϕ|χ⟩
for all
χ ∈X.
This is a linear functional on the Hilbert space X called the costate, Fϕ,
corresponding to the state ϕ.
The Riesz theorem tells us that each linear functional on the Hilbert
space X is the costate to some state of X.17
(v) Two diﬀerent products: For the costate F ∈Xd and the state ψ ∈X, we
introduce the inner product
F · ψ := F(ψ),
and the tensor product ψ ⊗F. By deﬁnition, this is a linear operator
ψ ⊗F : X →X given by

(vii) Adjoint operator: For each linear operator A : X →X, there exists a
unique linear operator A† : X →X such that
⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|A†ψ⟩

(7.18)
The operator A† is called the adjoint operator to A. An observable A is
characterized by the condition A = A†. Such operators are called self-
adjoint.
(viii) Dual operator: For each linear operator A : X →X, the dual operator
Ad : Xd →Xd is deﬁned as follows. To each costate F ∈Xd, we assign
the costate AdF given by
(AdF)(ϕ) := F(Aϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈X.
Observe that the adjoint operator A† and the dual operator Ad act on diﬀer-
ent spaces. Let ϕ1, . . . , ϕN be an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space X.
Then, the matrix elements of the adjoint operator A† are given by
bjk := ⟨ϕj|A†ϕk⟩,
j, k = 1, . . . , N.
Hence
bjk = ⟨Aϕj|ϕk⟩= ⟨ϕk|Aϕj⟩† = a†

j, k = 1, . . . , N.
The (N × N)-matrix A† := (bjk) is called the adjoint matrix to the matrix
A := (ajk).
The main theorem on observables. The following theorem is called
the principal axis theorem in mathematics, since it guarantees the existence
of a principal axis for quadratic curves and surfaces (for example, ellipses
and ellipsoids). This theorem can be traced back to Euler (1707–1783) and
Cauchy (1789–1857).18
Theorem 7.9 Each observable A : X →X possesses a complete orthonor-
mal system of eigenstates ϕ1, . . . , ϕN.

generally, the deﬁnition of the operator F(A) makes sense if the function
F : σ(A) →C is only deﬁned on the spectrum σ(A) of the observable A, that
is, on the set of eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λN of A. For example, if the complex

Obviously, Rλ(A)(λI −A) = (λA−I)Rλ(A) = I. Hence Rλ(A) = (λI −A)−1.
This operator is called the resolvent of the observable A at the point λ ∈C.

Fourier transform. Let X be a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space
of dimension N = 1, 2, . . . . Recall that the Hilbert space CN is equipped with
the inner product

The operator F : X →CN is deﬁned by
(Fψ)(j) := ⟨ϕj|ψ⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.
That is, the operator F maps each state ψ to the sequence of its Fourier
coeﬃcients,
Fψ = (⟨ϕ1|ψ⟩, . . . , ⟨ϕN|ψ⟩).
The operator F is called the discrete Fourier transformation with respect to
the orthonormal basis ϕ1, . . . , ϕN. The Parseval equation tells us that
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨Fϕ|Fψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
Consequently, the operator F : X →CN is unitary, and the Hilbert space X
is isomorphic (or unitarily equivalent) to the Hilbert space CN.
Let A : X →X be an observable with the eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λN and the
eigenvectors ϕ1, . . . , ϕN, respectively. Then

F(Aψ) = (λ1⟨ϕj|ψ⟩, . . . , λN⟨ϕN|ψ⟩).
This means that the observable A corresponds to the multiplication operator
⟨ϕj|ψ⟩→λj⟨ϕj|ψ⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N
in the Fourier space CN. We will show later on that there exists a far-reaching
generalization to self-adjoint operators in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces
due to John von Neumann.
Reformulation in terms of some measure integral. When generaliz-
ing the notion of ﬁnite Fourier series to inﬁnite dimensions, we will encounter
inﬁnite series and integrals with appropriate weights which can be regarded
as continuous sums (Fourier–Stieltjes integral transformations). All of these
notions can be described in a unique manner by the basic notion of measure
integral to be considered later on. In particular, for an arbitrary function
f : R →C, we get

R
f(x)dµ(x) =

j=1
f(j).
Here, the measure µ corresponds to a mass distribution on the real line where
precisely the points x1 = 1, . . . , xN = N possess the mass one. Furthermore,
for an arbitrary subset Ωof the real line,

Ω
f(x)dµ(x) =

j∈Ω
f(j).
This reformulation of ﬁnite sums in terms of a measure integral serves as
preparation for generalizing the Dirac calculus to inﬁnite dimensions.
In what follows we will translate the relations above into Dirac’s language
which is used in physics textbooks.

Dirac’s bra and ket symbols. The inner product ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩represents a
bracket. Mnemonically, it was Dirac’s idea to introduce the bra symbol ⟨ϕ|
and the ket symbol |ψ⟩which possess the following meaning.
• States and costates: Let ϕ, ψ ∈X and F ∈Xd. We write
|ψ⟩:= ψ,
⟨ϕ| := Fϕ,
|ψ⟩⟨ϕ| := ψ ⊗Fϕ.
This yields the inner product ⟨ϕ| · |ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩, and the Dirac product

|ψ⟩⟨ϕ| · |χ⟩= |ψ⟩⟨ϕ|χ⟩.
• Adjointness: We set |ψ⟩† = ⟨ψ| and ⟨ϕ|† = |ϕ⟩, as well as
(ab)† = b†a†
for operators and states. It turns out that this convention implies the right
rules for both the inner product and the adjoint operator. In fact, we obtain
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩† = (⟨ϕ| · |ψ⟩)† = ⟨ψ| · |ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩
where the dot denotes the inner product. Furthermore,
⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩† = (⟨ψ|A · |ϕ⟩)† = ⟨ϕ| · A†|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|A†ψ⟩.

Costates. Let F and ψ be a costate and a state, respectively, that is,
F ∈Xd and ψ ∈X. According to Dirac, we write
⟨F| · |ψ⟩= ⟨F|ψ⟩:= F(ψ).

⟨F|ϕ1⟩, . . . , ⟨F|ϕN⟩
are called the coordinates (or the Fourier coeﬃcients) of the costate F.
Dual operator. We are given the linear operator A : X →X. According
to Sect. 7.10, the dual operator Ad : Xd →Xd is deﬁned by the relation
(AdF)(ϕ) = F(Aϕ). In the Dirac calculus, this can be written as
⟨AdF|ϕ⟩= ⟨F|Aϕ⟩
for all
F ∈Xd, ϕ ∈X.
For each F ∈Xd, let us formulate the equation

In fact, ⟨AdFϕk|ϕj⟩= ⟨Fϕk|Aϕj⟩= ⟨ϕk|Aϕj⟩= akj = bjk.
Finally, let us mention that for an observable A : X →X, we get
⟨AdFϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩
for all

This follows from ⟨AdFϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨Fϕ|Aψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩.
7.12 The Trace of a Linear Operator
As all roads lead to Rome so I ﬁnd in my own case at least that all algebraic
inquiries, sooner or later, end at the Capitol of Modern Algebra over whose
shining portal is inscribed the Theory of Invariants.21
James Sylvester (1814–1897)
The theory of invariants came into existence about the middle of the nine-
teenth century somewhat like Minerva: a grown-up virgin, mailed in the
shining armor of algebra, she sprang forth from Cayley’s Jovian head:22
Her Athens over which she ruled and which she served as a tutelary and
beneﬁcent goddess was projective geometry.23

Geometry is the invariant theory of groups of transformations.

Let A : X →X be a linear operator on the complex N-dimensional Hilbert

Proposition 7.10 The value tr(A) does not depend on the choice of the
complete orthonormal system.

For three linear operators A, B, C : X →X, it follows from the associative
law, ABC = A(BC) = (AB)C, that
tr(ABC) = tr(BCA) = tr(CAB).
This means that the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations. The same
argument shows that the trace of a ﬁnite product of operators is invariant
under cyclic permutations of the factors. For example,
tr(ABCD) = tr(BCDA).
Linear invariance. Let T : X →X be a linear invertible operator. Then,
T T −1 = I implies that
tr(TAT −1) = tr(AT −1T ) = tr(A).
This tells us that the trace of a linear operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
space is invariant under linear isomorphisms.

7.12 The Trace of a Linear Operator
365
The theory of invariants plays a fundamental role in physics.
We will encounter this quite often in this treatise. For example, the trace
of observables is fundamental for statistical physics and quantum physics.
This importance of the trace stems from the fact that tr(A) assigns a real
number to the observable A. This real number can be measured in a physical
experiment.
The characteristic equation. Let A : X →X be a linear operator on
the complex N-dimensional linear space X with N = 1, 2, . . .. The equation
det(λI −A) = 0,
λ ∈C
(7.22)
is called the characteristic equation (or the secular equation) of the linear
operator A. For example, this equation was used by Lagrange (1736–1813)
and Laplace (1749–1827) for computing the long-term (secular) perturbations
of the orbits of planets. The solutions of (7.22) are precisely the eigenvalues
λ1, . . . , λN of the linear operator A. The set
σ(A) := {λ1, . . . , λN}
is called the spectrum of A, whereas the complement ϱ(A) := C \ σ(A) is
called the resolvent set of A.
The inverse operator (λI −A)−1 exists iﬀλ ∈ϱ(A).
This operator is called the resolvent of the operator A at the point λ ∈C.
Equation (7.22) can be written as
λN + pN−1λN−1 + . . . + p1λ + p0 = 0.
Since the determinant of a linear operator is an invariant, the coeﬃcients
p0, p1, . . . are invariants of the linear operator A. They are called the principal
invariants of A. In particular,
p0 = (−1)N det A,
pN−1 = −tr(A).
In terms of the eigenvalues of A,
det(λI −A) = (λ −λ1)(λ −λ2) · · · (λ −λN) = 0.
This implies
det(A) = λ1λ2 · · · λN,
tr(A) = λ1 + λ2 + . . . + λN.
For example, the characteristic equation det(λI −A) = 0 of the (2×2)-matrix
A = (aij) reads as
(λ −a11)(λ −a22) −a12a21 = λ2 −(a11 + a22)λ + a11a22 −a12a21 = 0.
This is identical to λ2 −tr(A) λ + det(A) = 0.

7.13 Banach Spaces
Banach spaces are used in order to study the convergence of iterative
methods which play a fundamental role in perturbation theory.
Folklore
Let −∞< a < b < ∞. The prototype of a Banach space is the space C[a, b]
of all continuous functions f : [a, b] →C equipped with the norm
||f|| := max
a≤t≤b |f(t)|.
Normed space. Set X := C[a, b]. For all f, g ∈X and all complex
numbers α, the following are met:
(B0) X is a complex linear space.
(B1) To each element f of X, there is assigned a nonnegative real number
||f||. Moreover, ||f|| = 0 iﬀf = 0.
(B2) Triangle inequality: ||f + g|| ≤||f|| + ||g||.
(B3) ||αf|| = |α| · ||f||.
Generally, a space X is called a complex normed space iﬀthe conditions (B0)
through (B3) are satisﬁed. By deﬁnition, a subset M of a normed space is
bounded iﬀthere exists a positive number r such that ||f|| ≤r for all f ∈M.
Furthermore, let X and Y be normed spaces, and let M be a subset of X.
The operator A : M →Y is called bounded iﬀit transforms bounded sets
into bounded sets.
Completeness. The convergence limn→∞fn = f in a complex normed
space X is deﬁned by
lim
n→∞||f −fn|| = 0.
A sequence (fn) in X is called a Cauchy sequence iﬀfor each given ε > 0,
there exists an index n0(ε) such that
||fn −fm|| < ε
for all
n, m ≥n0(ε).
A complex normed space is called a Banach space iﬀit is complete, that
is, each Cauchy sequence is convergent. It can be shown that each ﬁnite-
dimensional complex normed space is a Banach space. For the proof, see
Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 1.12. Moreover, with respect to the norm

space).

We are given the complex number κ. We are looking for an element ϕ of the
complex Banach space X which lies in the ball B := {ϕ ∈X : ||ϕ|| ≤r} of

method

Theorem 7.12 Suppose that the operator A : B →X satisﬁes the Lipschitz
condition
||Aϕ −Aχ|| ≤const ||ϕ −χ||
for all
ϕ, χ ∈B.
Then, there exists a number κ0 > 0 such that, for each given complex number
κ with |κ| ≤κ0, equation (7.23) has a unique solution ϕ, and the iterative
method (7.24) converges to ϕ as n →∞.
The proof of this theorem along with applications to numerous problems can
be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I.
The Banach space L(X, Y ). Let X and Y be ﬁnite-dimensional complex
Banach spaces. By L(X, Y ), we denote the set of all linear operators
A : X →Y.
For all A, B ∈L(X, Y ) and all complex numbers α, β, the linear combination
αA + βB is deﬁned by
(αA + βB)ϕ := αAϕ + βBϕ
for all
ϕ ∈X.
This way, L(X, Y ) becomes a complex linear space. For each A ∈L(X, Y ),
the norm
||A|| := max
||ϕ||≤1 ||Aϕ||
is a well-deﬁned real number, and it can be shown that L(X, Y ) becomes a
ﬁnite-dimensional complex Banach space. For the proof, see Zeidler (1995),
Vol. 1, Sect. 1.20. In particular, if we choose Y := C then the dual space Xd
of all linear functionals F : X →C becomes a complex Banach space with
respect to the norm
||F|| := max
||ϕ||≤1 |F(ϕ)|.

7.14 Probability and Hilbert’s Spectral Family
of an Observable
We want to formulate basic notions in ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces in
such a language that it can be easily generalized to inﬁnite dimensions later
on, by using John von Neumann’s operator calculus. In this section, we use
the measure integral to be introduced in Sect. 10.2.1. The reader who is not
familiar with this notion of integral should only look at the ﬁnite sums below.
Hilbert’s spectral family. Let A : X →X be an observable on the
complex N-dimensional Hilbert space X. Furthermore, let ϕ1, . . . , ϕN be a
complete orthonormal system of eigenstates of the operator A with the eigen-
values λ1, . . . , λN, respectively. That is, Aϕj = λjϕj for j = 1, . . . , N. In 1904
Hilbert introduced the spectral operator Eλ : X →X given by
Eλ :=

λj<λ
|ϕj⟩⟨ϕj|,
λ ∈R.

The symbol 
λj<λ means that we sum over all indices j with the property
that λj < λ. We call {Eλ}λ∈R the spectral family of the observable A. Spec-
tral families play a crucial role in quantum physics for describing the energy
spectrum of atoms, molecules, and elementary particles.

Randomness of quantum processes. Suppose that we measure the

is deﬁned to be

Observe that if Ωis the real line, then P(R) = N

by the Parseval equation, as expected. In the language of measure integrals,
P(Ω) =

Ω
d⟨Eλψ|Eλψ⟩.
This integral refers to the variable λ. Since the operator Eλ is self-adjoint
and E2
λ = Eλ, we get ⟨Eλψ|Eλψ⟩= ⟨ψ|E2
λψ⟩= ⟨ψ|Eλψ⟩. Hence
P(Ω) =

probability distribution function

The function F is a step function which jumps at the points λ1, . . . , λN.

7.15 Transition Probabilities, S-Matrix, and Unitary
Operators
In elementary particle physics, the S-matrix plays a fundamental role for
describing scattering processes. In what follows, we want to describe the basic
ideas of this fundamental concept in terms of a complex ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space X which has the dimension N = 1, 2, . . . Suppose that the two
systems
ϕ1, . . . ϕN
and
ψ1, . . . , ψN
form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space X. By the Dirac calculus, we
get the following key relation:

S-matrix. By deﬁnition, the transition amplitude from the state ψk to
the state ϕj reads as
sjk := ⟨ϕj|ψk⟩,
j, k = 1, . . . , N.
(7.27)
The idea is to regard this system (sjk) of transition amplitudes as the el-
ements of a complex (N × N)-matrix called the S-matrix. From (7.26) we
obtain immediately the following crucial property.
Proposition 7.13 The S-matrix (sjk) is unitary. Explicitly,

This allows us the following interpretation. For given ﬁxed state ψk with
k = 1, . . . , N, the number

7.15 Transition Probabilities, S-Matrix, and Unitary Operators
371
|srk|2 = |⟨ϕr|ψk⟩|2,
r = 1, . . . , N
is the transition probability from the state ψk to the state ϕr. We now want
to show that precisely unitary operators are related to systems of transition
probabilities.
From transition probabilities to unitary operators. Let ϕ1, . . . , ϕN
and ψ1, . . . , ψN be chosen as above. Deﬁne a linear operator S : X →X by
setting
Sϕk := ψk,
k = 1, . . . , N.
Then, the operator S is unitary, that is,
⟨Sϕ|Sψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
Let us prove this. Note ﬁrst that
⟨Sϕj|Sϕl⟩= ⟨ψj|ψl⟩= δjl
j, l = 1, . . . , N.
Thus, it follows from ϕ = N
k=1⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk and ψ = N
l=1⟨ϕl|ψ⟩ϕl that
⟨Sϕ|Sψ⟩is equal to

From unitary operators to transition probabilities. Conversely,
suppose that we are given a linear unitary operator S : X →X. Let
ϕ1, . . . , ϕN be an orthonormal basis of X. Finally, set
ψk := Sϕk,
k = 1, . . . , N.
Then, the system ψ1, . . . , ψN is also an orthonormal basis. In fact,
⟨ψk|ψl⟩= ⟨Sϕk|Sϕl⟩= ⟨ϕk|ϕl⟩= δjk.
The matrix elements of the operator S are given by
sjk := ⟨ϕj|Sϕk⟩,
j, k = 1, . . . , N.
Hence sjk = ⟨ϕj|ψk⟩, showing us that sjk represents a transition probability,
as in (7.27) above.
Physical interpretation. Suppose that the following situation is met.
• The given quantum system is in one of the states ϕ1, . . . , ϕN at the initial
time tin.
• The initial state ϕk passes over to the state Sϕk at the ﬁnal time tout.

372
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Then, the real number
|sjk|2 = |⟨ϕj|Sϕk⟩|2
represents the transition probability of the quantum system from the initial
state ϕk to the ﬁnal state ϕj during the time interval [tin, tout]. It is cru-
cial that the operator S is unitary. Otherwise, an interpretation in terms of
transition probabilities is not possible.
Typically, the original S-matrix constructed in the Standard Model in
particle physics is not unitary. However, this shortcoming can be ﬁxed by
introducing ghosts and antighosts (see Chap. 16).
7.16 The Magic Formulas for the Green’s Operator
Let H : X →X be an observable on the complex Hilbert space X of ﬁnite
dimension N = 1, 2, , . . . The three magic formulas read as follows: 24
(i) Fourier representation formula in terms of energy eigenstates:
G(E) =
N

j=1

G(E) = i
ℏ
 ∞
0
P +(t, t0) ei(t−t0)E/ℏdt,
ℑ(E) > 0.

The retarded propagator P + is also called the Feynman propagator.
(iii) The inverse Laplace transform:
P +(t, t0) =
1
2πi
lim
R→+∞
 R+iγ
−R+iγ
e−i(t−t0)E/ℏG(E) dE.
(7.30)
This is true for all real times t ̸= t0. For ﬁxed parameter γ > 0, we
integrate over the line {E ∈C :
ℑ(E) = γ} parallel to the real axis.
These formulas reﬂect the duality between time t and energy E which is
crucial for quantum ﬁeld theory. We will use the following terminology:
• energy operator H (Hamiltonian);
• energy eigenvalues E1, . . . EN with H|Ej⟩= Ej|Ej⟩for j = 1, . . . , N;
• energy eigenstates |E1⟩, . . . , |EN⟩;
24 Fourier (1768–1830) and Laplace (1749–1827); John von Neumann (1903–1957)
founded far-reaching generalizations of these formulas in the framework of his
operator calculus for self-adjoint operators in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

• energy spectrum σ(H) := {E1, . . . , EN};
• Green’s operator G(E) := (H −EI)−1 deﬁned for complex energies E with
E /∈σ(H);
• Green’s matrix Gjk(E) := ⟨j|G(E)|k⟩for j, k = 1, . . . , N with respect to
the complete orthonormal system |1⟩, . . . , |N⟩;
• propagator P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏfor all real times, t ∈R, and ﬁxed real
initial time t0.
• Retarded propagator (or Feynman propagator)
P +(t, t0) :=

P(t, t0),
if t ≥t0
0
if t < t0.
In terms of the Heaviside function, P +(t, t0) = θ(t −t0)P(t, t0).25 The re-
tarded propagator is switched on at time t0. The eigenstates form a complete
orthonormal system in the Hilbert space X. In the physics textbooks, the
retarded propagator (resp. the Green’s operator) is closely related to insta-
tionary (resp. stationary) scattering theory. For physics it is crucial that
The singularities of the Green’s operator in (7.28) are precisely the
points in the energy spectrum.
Physicists developed methods for computing the Green’s operator and the
retarded propagator. For example,
Feynman’s approach to quantum physics is based on representing the
retarded propagator by a path integral.
In what follows, we will discuss this. We start with the instationary Schr¨odin-
ger equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t ∈R.
(7.31)
Here, the dot denotes the time derivative.
7.16.1 Non-Resonance and Resonance
Motivated by Fourier’s approach to eigenoscillations of the vibrating string,
we are looking for special solutions of the instationary Schr¨odinger equation
(7.31) which have the following form
ψ(t) = e−iEt/ℏϕ,
t ∈R.
This leads to the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
Hϕ = Eϕ,
ϕ ∈X.
(7.32)
25 By deﬁnition, θ(t) := 1 if t ≥0, and θ(t) := 0 if t < 0.

374
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
In mathematics, this is called an eigenvalue problem. The corresponding in-
homogeneous problem looks like
Hϕ −Eϕ = χ,
ϕ ∈X.
(7.33)
In terms of physics, the right-hand side χ describes an external force. In
Schwinger’s terminology, χ is called a source term.
Basic ideas. There is a duality between the two problems (7.33) and
(7.32). To explain this, ﬁx the complex number E. We are interested in the
operator
G(E) := (H −EI)−1
called the Green’s operator in physics.
(N) Non-resonance case: Suppose E /∈σ(H). Then, the Green’s operator
G(E) : X →X
exists.26 For each given χ ∈X, the inhomogeneous equation (7.33) has
the unique solution ϕ = G(E)χ. Explicitly, the Green’s operator looks
like
G(E) =

Ej −E .
In terms of physics, the energy parameter E is diﬀerent from the energies
|Ej⟩, . . . , |EN⟩of the eigenoscillations of the system.
(R) Resonance case: Suppose E ∈σ(H). Without any loss of generality, we
assume that E = E1. Moreover, assume that the energy eigenvalue E1
has the multiplicity m, that is, E1 = E2 = . . . = Em and Ej ̸= E1 if
j > m.27 Then, the inhomogeneous problem (7.33) has a solution iﬀthe
resonance condition
⟨Ej|χ⟩= 0,
j = m + 1, . . . , N
(7.34)
is satisﬁed. In this case, the general solution of (7.33) looks like
ϕ = Greg(E1)χ + c1|E1⟩+ . . . + cm|Em⟩
where c1, . . . , cm are arbitrary complex numbers, and the regularized
Green’s operator is given by
Greg(E1) :=

26 In mathematics, the operator −G(E) = (EI −H)−1 is called the resolvent of
the Hamiltonian H at the point E. The functional analytic theory of resolvents
can be found in Lax (2002).
27 Suppose that 1 ≤m < N in order to exclude the trivial case H = E1I.

7.16 The Magic Formulas for the Green’s Operator
375
In terms of physics, the resonance condition (7.34) tells us that the exter-
nal force χ has to be compatible with the eigenoscillations of the system.
If this compatibility is violated, then the physical process is impossible.
Furthermore, the external force χ never uniquely determines the state
of the system. This complicates the physics. In order to obtain a unique
state, one has to add a side condition (see Theorem 7.15 below).
In Sect. 8.1 we will show how the diﬃculties of the resonance case
are related to renormalization.
In quantum ﬁeld theory, the Epstein–Glaser approach to renormalization dis-
plays most clearly that there are additional degrees of freedom which have to
be determined by side conditions coming from physics. The Epstein–Glaser
approach is based on the theory of generalized functions. This will be inves-
tigated in Volume II.
Proof. We will use the Fourier method, that is, we will determine the solution
by computing its Fourier coeﬃcents.
Ad (N). By (7.33), ⟨Ej|(H −E)ϕ⟩= ⟨Ej|χ⟩for all j. If Hϕj = Ejϕj,
then ⟨ϕj|Hϕ⟩= ⟨Hϕj|ϕ⟩= Ej⟨ϕj|ϕ⟩. Hence
⟨Ej|Hϕ⟩= Ej⟨Ej|ϕ⟩.
Thus, we obtain
(Ej −E)⟨Ej|ϕ⟩= ⟨Ej|χ⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.

Note that the resonance condition (7.35) does not restrict the Fourier coeﬃ-

adding the linear combination m

It is our goal to describe the regularized Green’s operator Greg(E1) in terms
of the operator P. We will show that Greg(E1) = (H + P −E1I)−1.

have ϕ = N

|Ej⟩⟨Ej|ϕ⟩.
This implies the decomposition
ϕ = Pϕ + (I −P)ϕ
where Pϕ is orthogonal to (I −P)ϕ. We write this as X = PX ⊕(I −P)X.
The space PX is identical with the eigenspace of the Hamiltonian H with
respect to the eigenvalue E1. We call P the orthogonal projector onto the
eigenspace PX.
Proposition 7.14 (i) Pϕ = ϕ iﬀHϕ = E1ϕ.
(ii) P 2 = P and P † = P.
Proof. Ad (i). Note that Pϕ = ϕ iﬀ⟨Ej|ϕ⟩= 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , N.
Ad (ii). Since P|Ej⟩= |Ej⟩for j = 1, . . . , m, we get P 2 = P. Moreover,
for all ϕ, ψ ∈X,

Let us now use the operator P in order to study the operator equation
Hϕ −E1ϕ = χ,
ϕ ∈X
(7.36)
in the resonance case (R) above. We are given χ ∈X. Reformulating (R), we
obtain the following result.
Theorem 7.15 Equation (7.36) has a solution iﬀPχ = 0. Assume that
Pχ = 0. Then, ϕ = Gregχ is the unique solution of equation (7.36) along
with the side condition Pϕ = 0.

Consequently, the linear operator Greg : (I −P)X →(I −P)X is invertible.
The pseudo-resolvent in the resonance case. Consider now the mod-
iﬁed operator equation
Hϕ + Pϕ −E1ϕ = χ,

in the resonance case (R) above.
Theorem 7.16 For each χ ∈X, equation (7.37) has the unique solution
ϕ = (H + P −E1I)−1χ = Greg(E1)χ.
Therefore, the operator −Greg(E1) is called the pseudo-resolvent of the
Hamiltonian H at the eigenvalue E1.
Proof. (I) Uniqueness. Let ϕ1 and ϕ2 be solutions of (7.37). Set ϕ := ϕ1−ϕ2.
Then
Hϕ −E1ϕ = −Pϕ.
By Theorem 7.15, P 2ϕ = 0. Hence Pϕ = 0. Finally, Theorem 7.15 tells us
that ϕ = 0.
(II) Existence. Set
ϕ := Greg(E1)χ =

In Sect. 8.1, we will show how to use Theorem 7.16 in the nonlinear
resonance case which is related to the concept of renormalization.

Damped oscillations and complex energy. Let us introduce the complex
energy
E = ℏ(ω −Γi)
where ω and Γ > 0 are real numbers. For a ﬁxed nonzero complex number
x0, the function
x(t) = x0e−iEt/ℏ= x0e−iωte−Γt,
t ∈R
describes a damped wave of angular frequency ω. It is reasonable to call the

x = x(t) by introducing the Heaviside function θ. This yields the function
y(t) := θ(t)x(t) = x0θ(t)e−iωte−γt,
t ∈R.
Explicitly, y(t) = x(t) if t ≥0, and y(t) = 0 if t < 0. Set x0 := 1. For the

The role of negative energies. In classical mechanics, the energy E
is always nonnegative. However, in quantum physics, negative energies are
allowed. In 1928 Dirac predicted that negative energies correspond to positive
energies of antiparticles.
The importance of the retarded propagator. We now want to inves-
tigate the Laplace transform of the retarded propagator. By deﬁnition, the
retarded operator reads as
P +(t, t0) := θ(t −t0)e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ,

spectively. Observe that it is crucial to use the retarded propagator P +(t, t0)
instead of the propagator P(t, t0) = e−i(t−t0)E/ℏ. Indeed, the Fourier trans-

integrals for the eigenvalues, by (7.39). However, if we replace the operator

H by the eigenvalue Ej, then we get a divergent integral. As the following
theorem shows, the situation changes completely if we consider the integral

e−i(t−t0)H/ℏeiE(t−t0)/ℏdE,
and if we use the complex energy E = ℏ(ω + γi) with γ > 0. The passage
from the propagator P(t, t0) to the retarded propagator P +(t, t0) means that
the process is switched on at time t0, and we study the process in the future,
t ≥t0. Therefore, the retarded propagator reﬂects causality.
Theorem 7.17 The retarded propagator P + is related to the Green’s opera-
tor G by the magic Laplace transform (7.29) and the inverse Laplace trans-

The lifetime of particles. In particle accelerators, physicists frequently
observe particles which have only a ﬁnite lifetime. To mathematically model
this phenomenon, we have to modify the instationary Schr¨odinger equation,
iℏ˙ψ(t) = (H −iV )ψ(t),
t ∈R
by adding the complex perturbation −iV to the self-adjoint Hamiltonian
H. Making the Fourier ansatz ψ(t) = e−iEt/ℏϕ, we obtain the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation
(H −iV )ϕ = Eϕ.
Assume that this equation has the complex eigenvalues

can be regarded as a state which has the energy ℏωj and the mean lifetime
∆t = 1/Γj. From the functional analytic point of view, this important phe-
nomenon is studied in the monograph by Hislop and Sigal (1996).
7.17 The Magic Dyson Formula for the Retarded
Propagator
We want to study the initial value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H(t)ψ(t),
t ≥t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(7.41)
We make the following assumptions:
(A1) Let X be a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. We are given the
initial state ψ0 ∈X at the initial time t0.
(A2) The operator H(t) : X →X is linear for each time t ∈R.
(A3) The map t →H(t) is smooth from R to the space L(X, X).28
(A4) The operator H0 : X →X is linear, and it does not depend on time t.
(A5) The function f : R →X is smooth.
The assumptions (A4), (A5) refer to problems considered below. In the spe-
cial case where X = CN, all of the operators and states are matrices. By
choosing an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space X and passing to ma-
trices, our problem can be always reduced to the space CN. If we pass to
matrix elements, then problem (7.41) represents a linear system of ordinary
diﬀerential equations. The unique solution of (7.41) can be written as
ψ(t) = P +(t, t0)ψ0,
t ≥t0.
It is our goal to prove the magic Dyson formula

for the retarded propagator (Feynman propagator) P + and to derive the

28 This means that the matrix elements of H(t) are smooth functions of time t.
Similarly, we assume that the Fourier coeﬃcients of f(t) are smooth functions
with respect to time t. Naturally enough, these deﬁnitions of smoothness do not
depend on the choice of the basis vectors.

describes the causal structure of time-dependent processes. Explicitly, the
chronological operator T organizes the factors in such a way that time is
increasing from right to left:
T {H(τ1)H(τ2)} :=

H(τ1)H(τ2)
if
τ1 ≥τ2,
H(τ2)H(τ1)
if
τ2 ≥τ1.
More generally,
T {H(τ1)H(τ2) · · · H(τn)} := H(τ1′)H(τ2′) · · · H(τn′).
(7.43)
Here, τ1′, . . . , τn′ is a permutation of τ1, . . . , τn such that τ1′ ≥τ2′ ≥. . . ≥τn′.
The Dyson formula (7.42) is to be understood mnemonically. Using the power

This is the famous Dyson series. The convergence of the Dyson series will
be proved on page 388. At this point, let us only mention the following two
special cases.
• Let X = C. Then, H(t) is a complex number for each time t, and we are
looking for a complex-valued function ψ : R →C. The Dyson formula now
corresponds to the classical solution
ψ(t) = ψ0e−i
ℏ
R t
t0 H(τ)dτ
of equation (7.41). This formula was known to Euler (1707–1783) and La-
grange (1736–1813).
• Suppose that H(t) = H0 for all times t. For (7.41), we then get the solution
formula
ψ(t) = e−itH0/ℏψ0.
For understanding quantum ﬁeld theory, observe that
The inﬁnite-dimensional version of the Dyson series lies at the heart
of the operator approach to quantum ﬁeld theory.
This will be considered in Chap. 15. Applications to quantum electrody-
namics will be studied in Volume II. Alternatively, the retarded propagator
P +(t, t0) can be represented by a path integral. This will be investigated in
Sect. 7.21.1 on page 417. It is now our goal to prove the convergence of the
Dyson series. To begin with, we need some preparatory results.

7.17 The Magic Dyson Formula for the Retarded Propagator

7.17.1 Lagrange’s Variation of the Parameter
The inhomogeneous linear problem. Let us start our approach to the
Dyson series by considering the initial-value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0ψ(t) + f(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(7.44)
We are looking for a solution ψ : R →X. By the classical theory of linear
diﬀerential equations, the initial-value problem (7.44) has a unique solution
which exists for all times t ∈R. Explicitly, this solution is given by the
formula
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ0 + 1
iℏ
 t
t0
P(t, s)f(s)ds
(7.45)
for all times t ∈R with the propagator
P(t, s) := e−iH0(t−s)/ℏ.
Consider the special case where X = C. Then, diﬀerentiation with respect to
time t yields
iℏ˙ψ(t) = iℏPt(t, t0)ψ0 + P(t, t)f(t) +
 t
t0
Pt(t, s)f(s)ds.
The propagator satisﬁes the initial-value problem
iℏPt(t, t0) = H0P(t, t0),
t ∈R,
P(t0, t0) = 1.
In addition, P(t, t) = 1 for all t ∈R. Hence
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0P(t, t0)ψ0 + f(t) + H0
 t
t0
P(t, s)f(s)ds = H0ψ(t) + f(t).
The same argument applies to all ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces X.
Variation of the parameter. Let us explain how the basic formula
(7.45) is related to the method of the variation of parameters. Again set
X = C. Then H0 is a complex number. The diﬀerential equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0ψ(t)
with vanishing external inﬂuence, f(t) ≡0, has the general solution
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)C,
t ∈R
where C is an arbitrary constant. Following Lagrange, we make the ansatz
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)C(t),
t ∈R

384
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
for getting the solution of the initial-value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0ψ(t) + f(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = C(t0).
From the physical point of view, Lagrange’s idea was to describe the inﬂuence
of the external force f on the physical state ψ by a variation of the constant C
in time. It remains to determine the function C = C(t). In fact, diﬀerentiation
with respect to time yields
˙ψ(t) = Pt(t, t0)C(t) + P(t, t0) ˙C(t).
Hence
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0P(t, t0)C(t) + iℏP(t, t0) ˙C(t) = H0ψ(t) + iℏP(t, t0) ˙C(t).
Therefore,
iℏP(t, t0) ˙C(t) = f(t).
Observe that we have the crucial propagator equation
P(t, s)P(s, τ) = P(t, τ),
P(t, t) = 1,
t, s, τ ∈R.
Hence P(t, s) = P(s, t)−1. Thus, iℏ˙C(t) = P(t0, t)f(t). This diﬀerential equa-
tion has the solution
iℏC(t) = iℏC(t0) +
 t
t0
P(t0, s)f(s)ds.
Multiplying this by P(t, t0) and using the propagator equation, we get the
desired result
iℏψ(t) = iℏP(t, t0)C(t0) +
 t
t0
P(t, s)f(s)ds.
The propagator. We introduce the retarded propagator
P +(t, t0) := θ(t −t0)P(t, t0),
t ∈R
(7.46)
and the advanced propagator
P −(t, t0) := −θ(t0 −t)P(t, t0),
t ∈R.
For the propagator,
P(t, t0) = P +(t, t0) −P −(t, t0),
t ∈R.

7.17.2 Duhamel’s Principle
The solution formula from (7.45) tells us that
The solution of the special problem with vanishing external inﬂuence,
f(t) ≡0, knows the propagator P(t, s), and hence it knows all about
the general solution by superposition.
This is called Duhamel’s principle.29 More precisely, the general solution ψ
of the initial-value problem (7.44) can be obtained as follows.
(H1) General homogeneous problem: Consider ﬁrst the case where the exter-
nal inﬂuence vanishes, f(t) ≡0. Then, the initial-value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0ψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = ψ0
has the unique solution
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ0,
t ∈R.
This determines uniquely the propagator P(t, t0).
(H2) Special homogeneous problem: Consider the case where the external
inﬂuence vanishes, f(t) ≡0, but the initial condition depends on the
external inﬂuence f(s) at time s. Then, for each given initial time s ∈R,
the initial-value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H0ψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(s) = f(s)
has the unique solution ψ(t) = P(t, s)f(s), t ∈R.
(I1) Inhomogeneous problem with special initial condition: Consider the case
where the external inﬂuence is acting, but the system rests at the initial
time t0. Then, the initial-value problem
iℏψ(t) = H0ψ(t) + f(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = 0
has the unique solution
ψ(t) =
 t
t0
P(t, s)f(s)ds,
t ∈R
which is obtained as a superposition of the solutions from (H2).
(I2) General inhomogeneous problem: The solution (7.45) of the general
initial-value problem (7.44) is obtained by a superposition of the spe-
cial solutions from (H1) and (I1).

7.17.3 The Volterra Integral Equation
Let us replace equation (7.44) on page 383 by the more general equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = H(t)ψ(t) + f(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = ψ0
(7.47)
where the Hamiltonian, H = H(t), depends on time t. It turns out that the
initial-value problem (7.47) is equivalent to the following Volterra integral
equation30

(7.48)
where F(t) := 1

 t
t0 f(s)ds. In fact, integrating equation (7.47), we get (7.48).
Conversely, suppose that the integral equation (7.48) has a continuous solu-
tion ψ : R →X. Then, the function ψ is diﬀerentiable, and it is the solution of
the diﬀerential equation (7.47). The standard method for solving the Volterra
integral equation (7.48) is the following iterative method

iℏ

(7.49)
for all indices n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Theorem 7.18 The Volterra integral equation (7.48) has a unique continu-
ous solution ψ : R →X. As n →∞, the sequence (ψn) converges uniformly
on each compact interval to the solution ψ.
Proof. To simplify notation, set t0 := 0 and ℏ:= 1. Fix T > 0. Let C[−T, T ]
denote the space of all continuous functions ψ : [−T, T ] →X. Equipped with
the norm
||ψ|| :=

−T ≤t≤T ||ψ(t)||,
the space C[−T, T ] becomes a complex Banach space.31
(I) Existence on the time interval [−T, T ]. Set H := max−T ≤t≤T ||H(t)||.

Hence
30 Volterra (1860–1950)
31 In the special case where X = C, the norm ||ψ(t)|| coincides with the modulus
of the complex number ψ(t).

Similarly, for n = 1, 2, . . . we get

||ψ1 −ψ0||.
Since the series eT H = 1+T H+. . . is convergent, the triangle inequality tells
us that

for all n ≥n0(ε) and all m = 1, 2, . . . Thus, the sequence (ψn) is Cauchy, and
hence it converges to an element ψ of the Banach space C[−T, T ], that is,
lim
n→∞||ψn −ψ|| = 0.
Therefore, the sequence (ψn) converges uniformly on the interval [−T, T ] to
the function ψ. Letting n →∞, it follows from (7.49) that the function
ψ : [−T, T ] →X is a solution of (7.48) on the time interval [−T, T ].
(II) Uniqueness. Let ψ and ϕ be two solutions of (7.48). As in (I), it
follows from
ψ(t) −ϕ(t) = 1

that ||ψ−ϕ|| ≤(T H)n

||ψ−ϕ||. Letting n →∞, we see that ψ = ϕ on [−T, T ].
Since the choice of T > 0 is arbitrary, we get uniqueness for all times t ∈R.
(III) Continuation. By (I) and (II), there exists a unique solution of (7.48)
on each time interval [−T, T ]. Choosing T = 1, 2, . . ., the corresponding so-
lutions can be continued to a unique solution on the real line.

P(t0, t0) = I
(7.50)
is called the propagator of equation (7.47). This designation is motivated by
the following fact.

Physical motivation of the magic Dyson formula. Using a formal
argument, we want to show that
The magic Dyson formula (7.51) is quite natural from the physical
point of view; it follows from the superposition principle.
The point is that we have to apply the superposition principle to time-
dependent interactions. To this end, we decompose the time interval [t0, t]
into small pieces of equal length, i.e., we set tk := t0 + k∆t, k = 0, 1, . . ., n.
Then
t0 < t1 < . . . < tn = t.
The following formulas are valid up to terms of higher order with respect to
the time diﬀerence ∆t. From the key diﬀerential equation iℏ˙ψ(t) = H(t)ψ(t)
we get
iℏψ(t + ∆t) −ψ(t)
∆t
= H(t)ψ(t).
This implies
ψ(t + ∆t) =
	
1 −i
ℏH(t)∆t

ψ(t).
It is convenient to write this as
ψ(t + ∆t) = e−i
ℏH(t)∆tψ(t),

390
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
up to terms of order (∆t)2. Consider ﬁrst the special case where n = 2. Then
t = t2, and
ψ(t) = e−i
ℏH(t1)∆tψ(t1) = e−i
ℏH(t1)∆te−i
ℏH(t0)∆tψ(t0).
Since t1 > t0, we may add the chronological operator T . Hence
ψ(t) = T {e−i
ℏH(t1)∆te−i
ℏH(t0)∆t}ψ(t0).
By the addition theorem for the exponential function,
ψ(t) = T e−i
ℏ(H(t1)+H(t0))∆tψ(t0).
Similarly, for n = 2, 3, . . . ,
ψ(t) = T e−i

Letting n →∞, we formally get

Using the propagator, ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ(t0). This yields the Dyson propagator
formula (7.51).
7.18 The Magic Dyson Formula for the S-Matrix
It is our goal to reformulate the Dyson propagator formula (7.51) in terms
of perturbation theory. This way, we will obtain the magic Dyson formula
for the S-matrix. This formula is the key to computing all kind of scattering
processes for elementary particles in quantum ﬁeld theory. The following
perturbed Hamiltonian
H = H0 + κV
is typical for perturbation theory. Here, the operators H0, V : X →X are
linear and self-adjoint on the complex N-dimensional Hilbert space X where
1 ≤N < ∞. The real constant κ ≥0 is called the coupling constant. Recall
that the retarded propagator with respect to the perturbed Hamiltonian H
is given by
P +(t, s) := e−i(t−s)H/ℏ,
t ≥s.
The key formula reads as
P +(t, s) = e−itH0/ℏS(t, s)eisH0/ℏ,
t ≥s
(7.52)
along with the magic Dyson formula
S(t, s) = T e−iκ
ℏ
R t
s VI(η)dη,
t ≥s.
(7.53)
Here, we set VI := eitH0/ℏV e−itH0ℏ. In physics, the operator S(t, s) is called
the S-matrix operator with respect to the ﬁnite time-interval [s, t].

7.18 The Magic Dyson Formula for the S-Matrix
391
Theorem 7.21 For all real times t and s with t ≥s, the formulas (7.52)
and (7.53) are valid.
Let us ﬁrst discuss the physical interpretation of the S-matrix. The crucial
relation reads as
⟨e−itH0/ℏϕout|P +(t, s)e−isH0/ℏϕin⟩= ⟨ϕout|S(t, s)ϕin⟩.
(7.54)
In terms of physics, this means the following:
• The function ψin(s) = e−isH0/ℏϕin describes the dynamics of a free particle
at time s. We regard this particle as an incoming free particle running from
time s = −∞until time s = +∞. At time s = 0, the particle is in the
state ϕin.
• The function ψout(t) = e−itH0/ℏϕout describes the dynamics of a free par-
ticle at time t. We regard this particle as an outgoing free particle running
from time t = −∞until time t = +∞. At time t = 0, the particle is in the
state ϕout.
• The transition amplitude
a := ⟨ψout(t)|P +(t, s)ψin(s)⟩
corresponds to the transition probability
|a|2 = |⟨ψout(t)|P +(t, s)ψin(s)⟩|2
from the free incoming particle at time s to the free outgoing particle at
time t with t > s. By (7.54),
|a|2 = |⟨ϕout|S(t, s)ϕin⟩|2.
This way, the transition probability |a|2 is related to the S-matrix operator
S(t, s). Using the transition probability |a|2, one can compute the correspond-
ing cross sections which can be measured in particle accelerators. This justi-
ﬁes the terminology S-matrix (or scattering matrix). More precisely, using a
complete orthonormal system |1⟩, . . . , |N⟩of the Hilbert space X, the matrix
to the operator S(t, s) reads as (Sjk(t, s)) where we set
Sjk(t, s) := ⟨j|S(t, s)|k⟩,
j, k = 1, . . . , N.
In order to simplify terminology, we frequently use the two terms ‘S-matrix’
and ‘scattering operator’ synonymously.
Proof of Theorem 7.21. Set ℏ:= 1. Fix the initial time s ∈R. By
(7.50), the Feynman propagator satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
iPt(t, s) = HP(t, s),
t ≥s,
P(s, s) = I.
(7.55)
Note that P +(t, t0) = P(t, t0) for all t ≥t0. The trick is to introduce the
operator

S(t, s) := eitH0P +(t, s)e−isH0.
By (7.55), it follows from P +(t, s) = e−itH0S(t, s)eisH0 that
H0e−itH0S(t, s)eisH0 + ie−itH0St(t, s)eisH0 = (H0 + κV )e−itH0S(t, s)eisH0.
Hence
ie−itH0St(t, s)eisH0 = κV e−itH0S(t, s)eisH0.
Setting VI(t) := eitH0V e−itH0, we get the modiﬁed diﬀerential equation
iSt(t, s) = κVI(t)S(t, s),
t ≥s,
S(s, s) = I.

7.19 Canonical Transformations
Canonical transformations were introduced by Jacobi (1804–1851) in order
to simplify the solution of diﬃcult problems in celestial mechanics. It is a
typical property of canonical transformations that
• they do not change the physics and
• they preserve the mathematical structure.
In quantum physics, the typical mathematical structure is given by the
Hilbert space structure. This motivates the following deﬁnition:
Canonical transformations are Hilbert space isomorphisms.
Recall that by a Hilbert space isomorphism (or a unitary operator), we un-
derstand a linear bijective map U : X →Y from the complex Hilbert space
X onto the complex Hilbert space Y which preserves the inner product,
⟨Uϕ|Uψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
We want to study two important canonical transformations in quantum
physics, namely,
• the passage from the Schr¨odinger picture to the Heisenberg picture, and
• the passage from the Schr¨odinger picture to Dirac’s interaction picture.
7.19.1 The Schr¨odinger Picture
Let H : X →X be a linear self-adjoint operator on the complex N-dimen-
sional Hilbert space X where 1 ≤N < ∞. For given ψ0 ∈X, the Schr¨odinger
equation reads as
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t ≥0,
ψ(0) = ψ0.
(7.56)

7.19 Canonical Transformations
393
We are looking for the function ψ : [0, ∞[→X. The unique solution of (7.56)
is given by
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ0,
t ≥0.
Here, ψ(t) describes the state of the quantum system at time t. By an ob-
servable, we understand an arbitrary linear self-adjoint operator
A : X →X.
Suppose that the initial state ψ(0) is normalized. Then, the state ψ(t) is
normalized for all times t ∈R. The real number
¯A(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|Aψ(t)⟩
is the mean value of the observable A measured in the state ψ(t) at time t.
Obviously, we get
¯A(t) = ⟨ψ(0)|eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏψ(0)⟩.
This identity is the basis for the passage to the Heisenberg picture to be
considered now.
7.19.2 The Heisenberg Picture
Fix time t ∈R. To each observable A : X →X, we assign the operator
AH(t) := eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ.
In addition, to each state ϕ ∈X, we assign the element ϕH(t) of X where
ϕH(t) := eitH/ℏϕ.
We call AH(t) and ϕH(t) the Heisenberg picture of the observable A and the
state ϕ at time t, respectively. Set
U(t) := eitH/ℏ.
The operator U(t) : X →X is unitary, that is,
⟨ϕ|χ⟩= ⟨U(t)ϕ|U(t)χ⟩
(7.57)
for all ϕ, χ ∈X and all t ∈R. Therefore, the transformation ϕH(t) = U(t)ϕ
represents a canonical transformation at time t. Observe the following:
(i) Dynamics: For the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0),
t ∈R,
the Heisenberg picture is given by
ψ(t)H = eitH/ℏψ(t) = ψ(0),
t ∈R.
This state does not depend on time t.

394
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
(ii) Observable: The Heisenberg picture AH(t) of the observable A satisﬁes
the following equation of motion32
iℏ˙AH(t) = [AH(t), H]−,
t ∈R
which replaces the Schr¨odinger equation in the Heisenberg picture.
(iii) Transition amplitude: It follows from (7.57) and AH(t) = U(t)AU(t)−1
that
⟨ϕ|Aχ⟩= ⟨ϕH(t)|AH(t)χH(t)⟩
for all ϕ, χ ∈X and all t ∈R.
7.19.3 The Dirac Interaction Picture
Dirac modiﬁed the Heisenberg picture in terms of perturbation theory. To
explain this, consider the situation
H = H0 + κV
which is typical for perturbation theory. Let H0, V
: X →X be linear
self-adjoint operators on the complex N-dimensional Hilbert space X where
1 ≤N < ∞. The real constant κ ≥0 is called coupling constant. In physics,
the Hamiltonian H is called a perturbation of the free Hamiltonian H0. The
idea of Dirac’s interaction picture is to modify the passage to the Heisen-
berg picture by replacing the Hamiltonian H by the free Hamiltonian H0.
Explicitly, ﬁx time t ∈R. To each observable A : X →X, we assign the
operator
AI(t) := eitH0/ℏAe−itH0/ℏ.
Moreover, to each state ϕ ∈X, we assign the element ϕI(t) of X where
ϕI(t) := eitH0/ℏϕ.
We call AI(t) and ϕI(t) the Dirac interaction picture of the observable A and
the state ϕ at time t, respectively. Set
U0(t) := eitH0/ℏ.
The operator U0(t) : X →X is unitary, that is,
⟨ϕ|χ⟩= ⟨U0(t)ϕ|U0(t)χ⟩
for all ϕ, χ ∈X and all t ∈R. Thus, the transformation ϕI(t) = U0(t)ϕ
represents a canonical transformation at time t. Observe the following.
32 In fact, diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields
iℏ˙AH(t) = −HeitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ+ eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏH.
Moreover, recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA.

7.20 Functional Calculus
395
(i) Dynamics: Let
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0),
t ∈R
be a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t), t ∈R with
respect to the perturbed Hamiltonian H. Then, the interaction picture
ψI = ψI(t) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation33
iℏ˙ψI(t) = κVI(t)ψI(t),
t ∈R.
Here, VI(t) := eitH0/ℏV e−itH0/ℏ.
(ii) Observable: The Dirac interaction picture AI(t) of the observable A sat-
isﬁes the following equation of motion
iℏ˙AI(t) = [AI(t), H0]−,
t ∈R
which replaces the Schr¨odinger equation in the Dirac interaction picture.
This equation only depends on the free Hamiltonian H0.
(iii) Transition amplitude: For all ϕ, χ ∈X and all t ∈R,
⟨ϕ|Aχ⟩= ⟨ϕI(t)|AI(t)χI(t)⟩.
7.20 Functional Calculus
Functionals generalize classical functions to systems with a ﬁnite or inﬁnite
number of degrees of freedom.
Folklore
It was emphasized by Feynman (1918–1988) and Schwinger (1918–1994) in
the 1940s that it is very useful for quantum ﬁeld theory to extend the classical
calculus due to Newton (1643–1727) and Leibniz (1646–1716) to functionals.
In mathematics, the diﬀerentiation of functionals and operators was intro-
duced by Fr´echet (1878–1973), Gˆateaux (1889–1914), and Volterra (1860–
1950) in about 1900. The goal was to give the calculus of variations a rigor-
ous basis.34 In the 1920s, functional integrals (Euclidean path integrals) were
introduced by Wiener (1894–1964) in order to mathematically describe Ein-
stein’s 1905 approach to Brownian motion (theory of stochastic processes).
We are going to discuss the basic ideas.
33 In fact, ψI(t) = eitH0/ℏψ(t). Diﬀerentiation with respect to time yields
iℏ˙ψI(t) = −H0eitH0/ℏψ(t) + eitH0/ℏiℏ˙ψ(t).
This is equal to −H0eitH0/ℏψ(t) + eitH0/ℏ(H0 + κV )ψ(t) = κVI(t)ψI(t).
34 This modern version of calculus is thoroughly studied in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I,
Chap. 4.

7.20.1 Functional Derivatives
Classical derivatives are generalized to functional derivatives; diﬀerentials
are linear functionals in modern mathematics.
Folklore
Let Z : X →C be a functional on the complex Hilbert space X. We write
Z = Z(J).
That is, to each element J of X we assign the complex number Z(J). In
quantum ﬁeld theory, such functionals arise in a natural way. Prototypes are
the action, S(ψ), of a quantum ﬁeld ψ and the generating functional Z for the
correlation functions (see Chap. 13). Then, Z(J) is the value of the generating
functional at the point J. Intuitively, the source function J describes an
external force acting on the physical system. The functional derivative Z′(J)
tells us then the response of the physical system under a small change of the
source. It is our goal to investigate the following generalizations:
• derivative ⇒functional derivative;
• partial derivative ⇒partial functional derivative;
• integral ⇒functional integral.
Notation. In mathematics, the following notions possess a precise mean-
ing:
• functional derivative and partial functional derivative,
• directional derivative,
• variation,
• diﬀerential,
• inﬁnitesimal transformation.
The confusion caused by inﬁnitesimals. The idea of inﬁnitesimals
was introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. They used the
relation
(δx)2 = 0
(7.58)
for the ‘inﬁnitesimally small quantity’ δx. Obviously, the only real number
δx which satisﬁes the magic relation (7.58) is given by δx = 0, which does
not ﬁt the intention of Newton and Leibniz. Thus, there is a lot of confu-
sion concerning (7.58), which has survived in parts of the physical literature.
Nowadays, the notions are completely clariﬁed in mathematics. There exist
two approaches, namely,
• the standard approach, and
• the non-standard approach.

7.20 Functional Calculus
397
In the standard approach, one completely avoids the relation (7.58). This
approach will be applied in the present ﬁrst volume and in most parts of the
further volumes. In non-standard analysis, one also introduces the following
notions:
• inﬁnitesimally small number, and
• inﬁnitely large number.
In the non-standard setting, the relation (δx)2 = 0 takes on a precise meaning
for an inﬁnitesimally small non-standard number, δx.35 In the volumes of this
treatise, we will show that relations of the form
∂2 = 0,
d2 = 0,
δ2 = 0
Q2 = 0
play a fundamental role in modern mathematics and physics. In particular,
• the relation ∂2 = 0 for the boundary operator ∂is responsible for Poincar´e’s
homology theory in algebraic topology,
• the Poincar´e lemma d2 = 0 for diﬀerential forms (that is, d(dω) = 0) is the
basis for de Rham’s cohomology theory in diﬀerential topology,
• the relation δ2 = 0 allows us to introduce the Hodge homology on Rieman-
nian manifolds which is dual to the de Rham cohomology, and
• the operator relation Q2 = 0 is crucial for the BRST quantization (or
cohomological quantization) of gauge theories (e.g., the Standard Model in
particle physics and string theories).
There exists a branch of mathematics called homological algebra which stud-
ies the far-reaching consequences of the relation Q2 = 0 in terms of exact
sequences and homology groups (resp. the dual cohomology groups).36 In the
35 Non-standard analysis was rigorously founded in 1960 by the logician Abraham
Robinson (1918–1974). This will be considered in Volume II, by using ultraﬁlters.
The elegant basic idea of non-standard analysis is to construct a ﬁeld ∗R of
mathematical objects called non-standard numbers such that ∗R represents an
extension of the ﬁeld R of real numbers,
R ⊂∗R.
Besides the real numbers, the ﬁeld ∗R contains inﬁnitesimally small numbers and
inﬁnitely large numbers. For all the elements of ∗R, the operations of addition,
multiplication, and division (by nonzero elements) are well deﬁned. In terms of
algebra, the set ∗R is a ﬁeld which extends the ﬁeld R of classical real numbers.
For two positive elements x and y of R, there exists always a nonzero natural
number n such that x < ny. This so-called Archimedian property of the ﬁeld R
is not anymore valid for ∗R.
36 The classical book is H. Cartan and S. Eilenberg, Homological Algebra, Prince-
ton University Press. In terms of physics, we recommend M. Henneaux and C.
Teitelboim, Quantization of Gauge Systems, Princeton University Press, 1993.
We will show in Volume IV on quantum mathematics that the physical origin of
homology and cohomology is rooted in electric circuits and the Maxwell equations
in electrodynamics.

398
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
early 1950s, Jean Leray and Henri Cartan showed that the theory of holo-
morphic functions of several variables can be reformulated elegantly in the
language of sheaf cohomology37
The one-dimensional case. As starting point, consider the Taylor ex-
pansion of the smooth function f : R →R,38
f(x + ∆x) = f(x) + f ′(x)∆x + o(∆x),
∆x →0.
We deﬁne
δx := ∆x,
δf := f ′(x)δx,
and
df(x)(h) := f ′(x)h,
dx(h) := h
for all
h ∈R.
With a view to generalizations to be considered below, note that
• the variations δx and δf are real numbers,
• whereas the diﬀerentials dx, df(x) : R →R are linear mappings (function-
als) on the real line R.
Obviously, we have df(x)(h) = f ′(x)dx(h) for all h ∈R. This is equivalent to
the rigorous formula
df(x) = f ′(x)dx,
in the sense of mappings.
The language of physicists. In the physics literature, one proceeds
frequently as follows. By Taylor expansion,
δf = f(x + δx) −f(x) = f ′(x)δx + f ′′(x)δx2
2
+ . . .
(7.59)
Using (δx)2 = 0, we get
δf = f ′(x)δx.
(7.60)
This is formally the same result as above. In terms of mathematics, let us
write
f(x) = g(x)
mod o(x),
x →0
iﬀf(x) −g(x) = o(x) as x →0. In particular, (δx)2 = o(x) as x →0 means
that
(δx)2 = 0
mod o(x),
x →0.
In standard mathematics, this replaces the magic relation (7.58) due to New-
ton and Leibniz. The passage to the language of physicists consists then in
37 See K. Maurin, Methods of Hilbert Spaces, PWN, Warsaw, 1972.
38 The deﬁnition of the classical Landau symbols o(∆x) and O(∆x) can be found
on page 932. In particular, we write r(χ) = o(χ) as χ →0 iﬀlimχ→0
r(χ)
χ
= 0.

7.20 Functional Calculus
399
dropping out the symbol mod o(x) for simplifying notation. In this sense,
equation (7.59) implies (7.60).
The general case. Consider now the functional Z : X →C on the
complex Hilbert space X. Our starting point is the deﬁnition of the functional
derivatives
δZ(J)
δJ
,
δ2Z(J)
δJ2
.
Synonymously, we will write
Z′(J) = δZ(J)
δJ
,
Z′′(J) = δ2Z(J)
δJ2
.
Naturally enough, we will formulate the corresponding deﬁnitions in such a
way that, in the special case where Z = Z(J) is a complex-valued function
of the real variable J (i.e., X = R), the functional derivative coincides with
the classical derivative. That is,
Z′(J) = δZ(J)
δJ
= dZ(J)
dJ
,
Z′′(J) = δ2Z(J)
δJ2
= d2Z(J)
dJ2
.
Moreover, our notation will be chosen in such a way that in the classical case,
X = R, we get
δZ(J)
δJ
(h) = Z′(h)h,
δ2Z(J)
δJ2
(h, k) = Z′′(J)hk
for all real numbers h, k. In the volumes of this treatise, we will extensively
use the calculus of diﬀerential forms. In modern mathematics, diﬀerentials
are not inﬁnitesimally small quantities, but functionals. Explicitly,
dZ(J)(h) = Z′(J)(h),
d2Z(J)(h, k) = Z′′(J)(h, k).
In this sense, dZ(J) = Z′(J) and d2Z(J) = Z′′(J).
In the calculus of variations, one writes
δZ := δZ(J)
δJ
(h).
This is called the ﬁrst variation of the functional Z at the point J in direction
of the vector h. More precisely, one has to write
δZ(J; h) := δZ(J)
δJ
(h).
Similarly,
δ2Z := δ2Z(J)
δJ2
(h, k).
More precisely,

400
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
δ2Z(J; h, k) = δ2Z(J)
δJ2
(h, k).
Basic deﬁnition of the functional derivative. Fix the point J ∈X.
For given h ∈X, deﬁne
δZ(J)
δJ
(h) := lim
t→0
Z(J + th) −Z(J)
t
.
Here, t is a real parameter. If this limit exists, then it is called the directional
derivative of the functional Z at the point J in direction of the vector h.
Equivalently,
δZ(J)
δJ
(h) := d
dt (Z(J + th))|t=0 .
This allows us the following physical interpretation. Think of Z as temper-
ature and regard J as a point in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Starting at
the point J, we move along a straight line in direction of the vector h. At
time t we reach the point J + th and we observe the temperature
Z(J + th).
Diﬀerentiating this with respect to time t at the initial time, t = 0, we get
the directional derivative of temperature Z at the point J in direction of the
vector h. This quantity is also called the temperature gradient at the point
J in direction of h. For the change of temperature, we get
Z(J + th) = Z(J) + tδZ(J)
δJ
(h) + o(t),
t →0.
In the general case, the map h →δZ(J)
δJ (h) represents an operator of the form
δZ(J)
δJ
: X →C.
Parallel to classical calculus, this operator is also denoted by the symbol
Z′(J) := δZ(J)
δJ
.
We call Z′(J) the functional derivative39 of the functional Z at the point J.
Higher-order functional derivatives. Fix h, k ∈X. Naturally enough,
we deﬁne
δ2Z(J)
δJ
(h, k) := d
dt
	δZ(J + tk)
δJ
(h)

|t=0
.
The map (h, k) →δ2Z(J)
δJ2 (h, k) represents an operator of the form
39 As a rule, the map Z′(J) : X →C is linear, but this is not always the case.

7.20 Functional Calculus
401
δ2Z(J)
δJ2
: X × X →C.
We also introduce the notation
Z′′(J) := δ2Z(J)
δJ2
.
This operator is called the second functional derivative40 of the functional Z
at the point J. Summarizing, the ﬁrst and second functional derivatives of
the functional Z at the point J are operators of the form
Z′(J) : X →C,
Z′′(J) : X × X →C.
Higher-order functional derivatives are deﬁned analogously. For example, ﬁx
h, k, l ∈X. We then deﬁne
δ3Z(J)
δJ3
(h, k, l) := d
dt
	δ2Z(J + tl)
δJ2
(h, k)

|t=0
.
Example. Deﬁne F(ψ) := ⟨ψ|ψ⟩for all ψ ∈X where X is a complex
Hilbert space.41 Then, for all h, k ∈X,
F ′(ψ)(h) = δF(ψ)
δψ
(h) = ⟨ψ|h⟩+ ⟨ψ|h⟩†
and F ′′(ψ)(h, k) = ⟨h|k⟩+ ⟨h|k⟩†.
Proof. Set χ(t) := F(ψ + th) for all t ∈R. Explicitly,
χ(t) = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩+ t(⟨ψ|h⟩+ ⟨h|ψ⟩) + t2⟨h|h⟩.
This implies χ′(0) = F ′(ψ)(h) = ⟨ψ|h⟩+ ⟨h|ψ⟩. Moreover, let k ∈X. Set
ϱ(t) := F ′(ψ + kt)(h) = ⟨ψ + tk|h⟩+ ⟨h|ψ + tk⟩,
t ∈R.
Hence ϱ′(0) = F ′′(ψ)(h, k) = ⟨k|h⟩+ ⟨h|k⟩.

7.20.2 Partial Functional Derivatives
Here, one ﬁnds a method which requires only a simple use of the principles
of diﬀerential and integral calculus; above all I must call attention to the
fact that I have introduced in my calculations a new characteristic δ since
this method requires that the same quantities vary in two diﬀerent ways.
Comte de Joseph Louis Lagrange, 1762
40 As a rule, Z′′(J)(h, k) is linear with respect to h and k, and we have the symmetry
property Z′′(J)(h, k) = Z′′(J)(k, h), but this is not always the case.
41 In a real Hilbert space X, we have F ′(ψ)(h) = 2⟨ψ|h⟩and
F ′′(ψ)(h, k) = 2⟨h|k⟩
for all
h, k ∈X.

402
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
By generalizing Euler’s 1744 method, Lagrange (1736–1813) got the idea
for his remarkable formulas, where in a single line there is contained the
solution of all problems of analytic mechanics.
Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851)
It is our goal to generalize the classical partial derivatives
∂f(x, y)
∂x
,
∂2f(x, y)
∂x∂y
to the partial functional derivatives
δZ(J)
δJ(x) ,
δ2Z(J)
δJ(x)δJ(y),
respectively. In classical calculus, the problem
f(x1, x2) = critical!
is equivalent to
∂f(x1, x2)
∂xj
= 0
for all indices j.
In the calculus of variations, the solutions of the principle of critical action
S(ψ) = critical!,
ψ ∈X
satisfy the so-called variational equation
δS(ψ)
δψ
= 0.
This implies
δS(ψ)
δψ(x) = 0
for all indices x
(7.61)
which represents the desired equation of motion for the ﬁeld ψ. This equation
is also called the Euler–Lagrange equation.
We will show in this treatise that all of the fundamental ﬁeld equa-
tions in physics are of the type (7.61).
For example, this concerns the electromagnetic ﬁeld, non-relativistic and rel-
ativistic quantum mechanics, the Standard Model in particle physics, and the
theory of general relativity. The basic tool for introducing partial functional
derivatives is the notion of the density of a given functional; this generalizes
the classical mass density
Density of a functional. Consider a set M equipped with a measure µ.
Let X be an appropriate subspace of the space of all the functions h : M →C.
For given function ϱ ∈X, deﬁne

7.20 Functional Calculus
403
F(h) :=

C
ϱ(x)h(x)dµ(x)
for all
h ∈X.
The function ϱ is called the density function of the functional F. This def-
inition is well formulated if the function ϱ is uniquely determined by the
functional F. This uniqueness has to be checked in each case. Examples will
be considered below. Suppose now that the functional derivative δZ(J)
δJ
has a
density ϱ, that is,
δZ(J)
δJ
(h) =

M
ϱ(x)h(x)dµ(x)
for all
h ∈X.
We then deﬁne
δZ(J)
δJ(x) := ϱ(x).
This is called the partial functional derivative of the functional Z at the
point J with respect to the ‘index’ x. Summarizing, for all h ∈X, we get the
suggestive formula
δZ(J)
δJ
(h) =

M
δZ(J)
δJ(x) h(x)dµ(x).
The variational lemma. Let us now study a few examples which are
prototypes for general situations arising in quantum ﬁeld theory. For checking
the density property, we will use the following result. Let −∞< a < b < ∞,
and let C[a, b] denote the space of all continuous functions f : [a, b] →R.
Proposition 7.22 Suppose that for given two functions f, g ∈C[a, b], we
have
 b
a
f(x)h(x)dx =
 b
a
g(x)h(x)dx
for all
h ∈C[a, b].
(7.62)
Then f(x) = g(x) for all x ∈[a, b].
Proof. Set F(x) := f(x) −g(x). Then
 b
a F(x)h(x)dx = 0 for all functions
h ∈C[a, b]. Choosing h = F,
 b
a
F(x)2dx = 0.
Hence F(x) = 0 for all x ∈[a, b].
2
It is important for the calculus of variations that there exists a stronger
variant of the preceding proposition. To this end, let D(a, b) denote the set
of all smooth functions h : [a, b] →R which have compact support in the
open interval ]a, b[, that is, they vanish in some open neighborhoods of the
boundary points a and b.

404

Proposition 7.23 Suppose that for given two functions f, g ∈C[a, b], we
have
 b
a
f(x)h(x)dx =
 b
a
g(x)h(x)dx
for all
h ∈D(a, b).
(7.63)
Then f(x) = g(x) for all x ∈[a, b].
This is a special case of the variational lemma to be considered in Prop. 10.15
on page 543. The idea of proof is to use a limiting process in order to get the
identity (7.62) from (7.63).
Example. Set X := C[a, b]. Fix the function ϱ ∈X, and deﬁne
Z(J) :=

This is the second partial functional derivative of the functional Z.

Example. In the calculus of variations, the density functions of function-
als are obtained by using integration by parts. As a prototype, consider the
functional
S[q] := 1

 t1
t0
˙q(t)2dt
for all
q ∈X.
The dot denotes the time derivative. By deﬁnition, the symbol X represents
the space of all smooth functions q : [t0, t1] →R on the compact time interval
[t0, t1] which vanish on the boundary, that is, q(t0) = q(t1) = 0.
Proposition 7.26 Let q ∈X. The functional derivative is given by
δS[q]
δq (h) =
 t1
t0
−¨q(t)h(t)dt
for all
h ∈X.
This functional has the density −¨q.
Therefore, for each point t ∈[t0, t1], we deﬁne the partial functional derivative
δS[q]
δq(t) := −¨q(t).
Proof. (I) Functional derivative. Fix q, h ∈X. For each parameter τ ∈R,
deﬁne
χ(τ) := S[q + τh] = 1

Hence χ′(0) = S′[q](h) =

h(t0) = h(t1) = 0, integration by parts yields
S′[q](h) = −

¨q(t)h(t)dt

This proves the claim for the functional derivative.

is called the action of the particle. Here, κ is a positive number called coupling
constant, and the given function F : [t0, t1] →R is smooth. By deﬁnition,
the space X consists of all smooth functions q : [t0, t1] →R which satisfy the
following boundary condition
q(t0) = 0,
q(t1) = 0.
The principle of least action for the motion of the particle reads as
S[q] = min!,
q ∈X.
(7.65)
Let us ﬁrst compute the functional derivative. To this end, ﬁx q, h ∈X. Set
χ(τ) := S[q + τh],

yields
S′[q](h) =

(−m¨q(t) −κq(t) + F(t)) h(t)dt.
Hence, for all t ∈[t0, t1], we obtain the partial functional derivative

δq(t) = −m¨q(t) −κq(t) + F(t).
Theorem 7.27 Each solution q = q(t) of the principle of least action (7.65)
satisﬁes the Euler–Lagrange equation

for all
t ∈[t0, t1].
Explicitly, m¨q(t) = −κq(t) + F(t).

This is the equation of a so-called harmonic oscillator with the restoring force
−κq and the external force F. If the external force vanishes, F = 0, then we
get the special solution
q(t) = const · sin(ωt),
t ∈R.
This motion represents an oscillation on the real line with the positive angular
frequency ω given by the relation ω2 = κ/m.
Proof. Let q ∈X be a solution of the minimum problem (7.65). Fix the
function h ∈D(t0, t1). Introduce the function
χ(τ) := S[q + τh]
for all
τ ∈R.
Since h(t0) = h(t1) = 0, we get h ∈X. Consequently, the simpliﬁed problem
χ(τ) = min!,
τ ∈R
has the solution τ = 0. By classical calculus,
χ′(0) = 0.
This yields S′[q](h) = 0 for all h ∈D(t0, t1). Hence

δS[q]
δq(t) h(t)dt = δS[q]
δq (h) = 0
for all h ∈D(t0, t1). This implies
δS[q]
δq(t) = 0
for all
t ∈[t0, t1],
by the variational lemma (Prop. 7.23). This ﬁnishes the classical proof in-
vented by the young Lagrange in 1762.

The same argument applies to all kinds of variational problems in
mathematics and physics.
In the volumes of this treatise, we will encounter plenty of such variational
problems.
The principle of critical action. Consider ﬁrst the smooth real func-
tion f : R →R. By deﬁnition, the problem
f(x) = critical!,
x ∈R
is equivalent to f ′(x) = 0. The solutions are called the critical points of the
function f. This includes minimal points, maximal points, and horizontal
inﬂection points. Similarly, by deﬁnition, the following critical point problem
S[q] = critical!,
q ∈X
(7.66)

7.20 Functional Calculus
409
is equivalent to S′[q] = 0. The same argument as above shows that each
solution q of (7.66) satisﬁes the same Euler–Lagrange equation as obtained
in Theorem 7.27.
The principle of least action versus the principle of critical ac-
tion. Let us ﬁnish with the following remark. Consider ﬁrst the real function
f : R →R given by f(x) := x3. The minimum problem
f(x) = min!,
x ∈R
has no solution, but the critical point problem
f(x) = critical!,
x ∈R
has the solution x = 0. In fact, f ′(x) = 0 implies 3x2 = 0, and hence x = 0.
The same happens to more general variational problems. Therefore, we will
not use the principle of least action, but the more general principle of critical
action.
The language of physicists. In Sect. 11.2.3 on page 591, we will con-
sider a formal deﬁnition of partial functional derivatives based on the Dirac
delta function. This formal deﬁnition is used in most physics textbooks. The
experience shows that both our rigorous approach introduced above and the
formal approach based on the Dirac delta function lead to the same results.
7.20.3 Inﬁnitesimal Transformations
Inﬁnitesimal symmetry transformations know much, but not all about
global symmetry transformations.
Folklore
In order to investigate the invariance of physical processes under symmetries,
physicists simplify the considerations by using inﬁnitesimal transformations.
This theory was created by Sophus Lie (1849–1899) in about 1870. Let us
discuss some basic ideas in rigorous terms.
Roughly speaking, inﬁnitesimal transformations are obtained by ne-
glecting terms of higher order than one.
The prototype of inﬁnitesimal transformations are inﬁnitesimal rotations. Let
us study this ﬁrst.
Inﬁnitesimal rotations. The transformation
x′ = x cos θ −y sin θ,
y′ = x sin θ + y cos θ
(7.67)
represents a counterclockwise rotation about the origin in the plane, with
rotation angle θ (Fig. 7.2). For small rotation angle θ, we get
x′ = x −yθ + o(θ),
y′ = y + xθ + o(θ),
θ →0.

Thus, the linearization of the rotation (7.67) reads as
x′ = x −yθ,
y′ = y + xθ
(7.68)
where θ is a ﬁxed real number. This linear transformation is called an in-
ﬁnitesimal rotation with rotation angle θ. Physicists set
δθ := θ,
δx := x′ −x,
δy := y′ −y.
Therefore, the inﬁnitesimal rotation (7.68) reads as
δx = −yδθ,
δy = xδθ.
(7.69)
Invariant functions. The smooth function f : R2 →R is called invariant
under rotations iﬀfor all rotation angles θ and all x, y ∈R, we have
f(x′, y′) = f(x, y).
Moreover, the function f is called invariant under inﬁnitesimal rotations iﬀ
for all rotation angles δθ and all x, y ∈R, we get
f(x + δx, y + δy) = f(x, y) + o(δθ),
δθ →0
where δx and δy are given by (7.69). As the prototype of the classical Lie
theory on invariant functions, let us prove the following result. The point
is that global symmetry properties can be described by a local equation,
namely, a partial diﬀerential equation.
Proposition 7.28 For each smooth function f : R2 →R, the following three
conditions are equivalent.
(i) The function f is invariant under inﬁnitesimal rotations.
(ii) The function f satisﬁes the Lie partial diﬀerential equation
xfy(x, y) −yfx(x, y) = 0
for all
(x, y) ∈R2.
(7.70)
(iii) The function f is invariant under rotations.
(iv) In polar coordinates ϕ, r, the function f only depends on r.

7.20 Functional Calculus
411
Proof. (i) ⇔(ii). By Taylor expansion, as δθ →0,
f(x + δx, y + δy) −f(x, y) = fx(x, y)δx + fy(x, y)δy + o(θ)
= (−yfx(x, y) + xfy(x, y))δθ + o(δθ).
If (i) holds true, then as δθ →0,
o(δθ) = (−yfx(x, y) + xfy(x, y))δθ + o(δθ).
Dividing this by the real number δθ and letting δθ →0, we get (ii).
Conversely, if (ii) holds true, then f(x + δx, y + δy) −f(x, y) = o(δθ) as
δθ →0. This implies (i).
(ii) ⇔(iii). Introduce polar coordinates,
x = r cos ϕ,
y = r sin ϕ,
and set F(ϕ, r) := f(x, y). By the chain rule,
Fϕ(ϕ, r) = −fx(x, y)r sin ϕ + fy(x, y)r cos ϕ = −yfx(x, y) + xfx(x, y).
The function f is invariant under rotations iﬀthe function F does not depend
on the variable ϕ, that is, Fϕ(ϕ, r) = 0 for all ϕ, r. This is equivalent to (ii).
(iii) ⇔(iv). This is obvious.

Conservation laws. From the inﬁnitesimal transformation (7.69) we get
δx
δθ = −y,
δy
δθ = x.
Letting θ →0, we obtain the dynamical system
˙x(θ) = −y(θ),
˙y(θ) = x(θ)
(7.71)
which is called the characteristic system to the Lie equation (7.70). The
solutions of the characteristic system (7.71) read as
x(θ) = x0 cos θ −y0 sin θ,
y(θ) = x0 sin θ + y0 cos θ.
Regarding θ as time, θ := t, we get rotations around the origin with angular
velocity ω = 1. A smooth function f : R2 →R is a conservation law for this
dynamical system (i.e., the function is constant along the trajectories) iﬀf
is invariant under rotations. By Prop. 7.28, the function f satisﬁes the Lie
partial diﬀerential equation (7.70).
The language of complex numbers. Set
z := x + yi,
z′ := x′ + y′i.
Using the Euler equation eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ, the rotation formula (7.67) can
be elegantly written as

412
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
z′ = eiθz.
From the Taylor expansion eiθ = 1 + iθ + o(θ), we get
z′ = z + izθ + zo(θ),
θ →0.
This yields the linearization
z′ = z + izθ.
Setting δθ := θ and δz := z′ −z, we get z′ = z + δz along with
δz = izδθ.
This represents an inﬁnitesimal rotation. The addition theorem for the expo-
nential function yields the so-called group equation
ei(ϕ+θ) = eiϕeiθ
for all
ϕ, θ ∈R
(7.72)
which tells us that the composition of rotations corresponds to the addition
of the rotation angles ϕ and θ.
The language of matrices. Introducing the matrix
R(θ) :=

cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ

for all
θ ∈R
the rotation formula (7.67) can be written as

x′
y′

= R(θ)

x
y

.
The group equation (7.72) corresponds to
R(ϕ + θ) = R(ϕ)R(θ)
for all
ϕ, θ ∈R.
Explicitly,
R(ϕ + θ) =

cos(ϕ + θ)
−sin(ϕ + θ)
sin(ϕ + θ)
cos(ϕ + θ)

and
R(ϕ)R(θ) =

cos ϕ
−sin ϕ
sin ϕ
cos ϕ
 
cos θ
−sin θ

Hence

R(ϕ)R(θ) =

cos ϕ cos θ −sin ϕ sin θ
−cosϕ sin θ −sin ϕ cos θ
cos ϕ sin θ + sin ϕ cos θ
cos ϕ cos θ −sin ϕ sin θ

.
From R(ϕ+θ) = R(ϕ)R(θ) we obtain the addition theorem for trigonometric
functions. For example,
sin(ϕ + θ) = cos ϕ sin θ + sin ϕ cos θ
for all
ϕ, θ ∈R.
Diﬀerentiation of R(θ) with respect of θ at the point θ = 0 yields
R′(0) =

0 −1
1 0

.
Moreover, diﬀerentiating the group equation R(ϕ + θ) = R(ϕ)R(θ) with
respect to the angle ϕ at ϕ = 0, we obtain the diﬀerential equation
R′(θ) = AR(θ),
θ ∈R,
R(0) = I
by setting A := R′(0). This initial-value problem has the unique solution42
R(θ) = eθA
for all
θ ∈R.
By Taylor expansion,
R(θ) = I + θA + o(θ),
θ →0.
Inﬁnitesimal transformations correspond to the matrix θA. Explicitly, writing
δθ instead of θ, we get

δx
δy

= δθ · A

for all
δθ ∈R.
This is equivalent to the inﬁnitesimal rotation δx = −yδθ, δy = xδθ.
The inﬁnitesimal strategy for one-parameter Lie groups and con-
servation laws. We now want to generalize the results for rotations in the

For all parameters t, s ∈R, we have the so-called group equation (or causality
equation)
e(t+s)A = etAesA.
By Taylor expansion, etA = I + tA + o(t) as t →0. Thus, the linearization of
the transformation
x′ = etAx,
t ∈R
looks like
x′ = x + tAx,
t ∈R.
Writing δt instead of t and setting δ := x′ −x, we get x′ = x + δx along with
the so-called inﬁnitesimal transformation
δx = δt · Ax,
δt ∈R.
(7.73)
By deﬁnition, the function f : Kn →K is called invariant under the Lie group
G iﬀ
f(etAx) = f(x)
for all x ∈Kn and all t ∈R. Moreover, the function f is called invariant
under the inﬁnitesimal transformations (7.73) iﬀ
f(x + δx) −f(x) = o(δt),
δt →0
for all x ∈Kn and all real parameters δt.
Theorem 7.29 For a smooth function f : Kn →K, the following three
statements are equivalent.
(i) The function f is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal transformations of
the one-parameter Lie group G.
(ii) The function f satisﬁes the Lie equation
f ′(x)(Ax) = 0

From the physical point of view, the solutions of the Lie system (7.75) of ﬁrst-
order partial diﬀerential equations are the conservation laws to the dynamical
system x(t) = etAx(0), t ∈R described by the system
˙x(t) = Ax(t),
t ∈R
(7.76)
of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Equation (7.76) is called the characteristic
equation to (7.75); it follows from the inﬁnitesimal transformation (7.73) by
passing to the quotient δx
δt = Ax and letting δt →0.
Proof. By Taylor expansion,
f(x + th) = f(x) + f ′(x)(h) + o(t),

By the chain rule, γ′(0) = f ′(x)(Ax). Condition (i) is equivalent to
γ(t) −γ(0) = o(t),
t →0.
In turn, this is equivalent to γ′(0) = 0.
(ii) ⇔(ii). Now set g(t) := f(etAx) for all t ∈R. By the chain rule,
g′(t) = f ′(etAx)(AetAx)
for all
t ∈R.
Replacing x with etAx, condition (ii) is equivalent to
g′(t) = 0
for all
t ∈R.
In turn, this is equivalent to g(t) = const for all t ∈R, which corresponds to
condition (iii).

Lack of global information. The theory of Lie matrix groups is funda-
mental for elementary particle physics. This will be studied in the following
volumes. In Sect. 5.7.1 we have discussed the crucial fact that the two ma-
trix Lie groups SO(3) and SU(2) have isomorphic Lie algebras, and hence
they are locally isomorphic, but they are not globally isomorphic. In this
important case, the inﬁnitesimal transformations do not know all about the
global transformations. It is quite remarkable that nature sees this diﬀerence
in terms of the electron spin.

7.20.4 Functional Integration
We want to generalize the notion of classical integral to integrals over func-
tionals.
Finite measure integral. Let Q be a ﬁnite nonempty set. Suppose that
a nonnegative real number µ(q) is assigned to each point q of Q. We regard
this number as the mass of the point q. For each function F : Q →C, we
deﬁne the integral with respect to the measure µ by

Q
F(q)dµ(q) :=

q∈Q
F(q)µ(q).
Path integral. Let us now consider the special case where the set Q
consists of a ﬁnite number of curves. To this end, we divide the time interval
[s, t] into small equidistant time intervals
s = t0 < t1 < . . . < tm = t
where tj := t0 + j∆t for all j = 0, 1, . . ., m. Consider continuous, piecewise
linear curves
q : [s, t] →C
that attain some of the given discrete values q1, . . . , qN at the discrete time
points t0, . . . , tm (Fig. 7.3). Let Q∆t denote the set of all such curves. Suppose
that we are given the functional F : Q∆t →C which assigns a complex
number F(q) to each curve q ∈Q∆t (e.g., the curve length). Then, the
measure integral

Q∆t
F(q)dµ(q) :=

q∈Q∆t
F(q)µ(q)
(7.77)
is called a path integral. In what follows we will use the terms ‘functional
integral’ and ‘path integral’ synonymously.
7.21 The Discrete Feynman Path Integral
I found myself thinking of a large number of integrals, one after the other
in sequence. In the integrand was the product of the exponentials, which,
of course, was the exponential of the sum of the terms like ϵL. Now L is
the Lagrangian and ϵ is like the time interval dt, so that if you took a
sum of such terms, that’s exactly like an integral. That’s like Riemann’s
formula for the integral
R
Ldt; you just take the value at each point and
add them together. We are to take the limit as ϵ →0, of course. Therefore,
the connection between the wave function of one instant and and the wave

function of another instant a ﬁnite time later could be obtained by an inﬁ-
nite number of integrals of eiS/ℏ, where S is the action expression. . . This
led later on to the idea of the amplitude of the path; that for each possi-
ble way that the particle can go from one point to another in space-time,
there’s an amplitude eiS/ℏ, where S is the action along the path. Ampli-
tudes from various paths superpose by addition. This then is another, a
third way, of describing quantum mechanic, which looks quite diﬀerent
than that of Heisenberg or Schr¨odinger, but is equivalent to them.43
Richard Feynman (1918–1988)
Nobel Lecture in 1965
In modern textbooks in physics, the approach to quantum ﬁeld theory is
mainly based on functional integrals which can be viewed as generalized path
integrals. In the following we want to discuss the basic ideas.
7.21.1 The Magic Feynman Propagator Formula
The magic Feynman propagator formula is given by the following discrete
path integral
⟨Qout|P(tout, tin)Qin⟩=

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
(7.78)
In terms of physics, this is the transition amplitude of the propagator with re-
spect to the ﬁnite time interval [tin, tout]. This transition amplitudes describes
the dynamics of the quantum system. The real number
|⟨Qout|P(tout, tin)Qin⟩|2
is the transition probability from the initial state Qin at the initial time tin
to the ﬁnal state Qout at the ﬁnal time tout. The explicit form of
• the action S[q] along the curve q : [tin, tout] →R,
• and the measure µ[q] of the curve q = q(t)

ϱr.
The path integral (7.78) represents a ﬁnite sum of the form

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
eiS[q]/ℏµ[q].
The real number ∆Sr[q] is called the local action of the curve q on the time
interval [tr, tr+1]. By deﬁnition, the total action of the curve q is then obtained
by summing up the local actions. The precise formulation will be given in
(A1) through (A5) below.
The importance of the magic formula (7.78) relies on the fact that
it represents the crucial transition amplitude as the superposition of
simpler physical eﬀects given by ei∆Sr[q]/ℏwhich are acting on small
time intervals [tr, tr+1] of length ∆t.
This can be regarded as a generalization of Newton’s classical strategy of
describing the dynamics of mechanical systems by their behavior during in-
ﬁnitesimally small time intervals. We make the following assumptions.
(A1) Energy operator: We are given a linear self-adjoint operator
H : X →X
on the N-dimensional complex Hilbert space X, 1 ≤N < ∞. This op-
erator is called the energy operator (or the Hamiltonian). There exists a
complete orthonormal basis |E1⟩, . . . , |EN⟩of the Hilbert space X such
that
H|Ej⟩= Ej|Ej⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.
The real eigenvalues E1, . . . , EN of the operator H are the possible en-
ergy values of the system with the corresponding energy eigenstates
|E1⟩, . . . , |EN⟩.
44 Here, ∆Sr[q]/ℏand ϱr are the argument and the modulus of the complex num-
ber ⟨Q(tr+1)|e−i∆t·H/ℏQ(tr)⟩, respectively. Equation (7.79) determines the real
argument ∆Sr[q]/ℏonly up to a multiple of the number 2π. The same is true
for S[q]/ℏ. However, the point is that the factor eiS[q]/ℏarising in the magic
Feynman propagator formula (7.78) is uniquely determined.

(A2) Position operator: Let Q1, . . . , QN denote an arbitrary orthonormal ba-
sis of the Hilbert space X. In order to get some intuitive interpretation,
suppose that there exists a linear self-adjoint operator Q : X →X such
that
QQj = qjQj,
j = 1, . . . N.
We regard the operator Q as position operator, and the eigenvalues
q1, . . . , qN may be regarded as the positions of a quantum particle on
the real line. The position qj corresponds to the normalized state Qj. As
in the Dirac calculus, we will use the notation |Qj⟩instead of Qj.
(A3) Feynman propagator: Let us also introduce the propagator
P(t, s) := e−i(t−s)H/ℏ,
s, t ∈R.
(7.80)
The truncated operator
P +(t, s) := θ(t −s)P(t, s),
t, s ∈R
is called the retarded propagator (or the Feynman propagator).
(A4) Piecewise linear paths: Decompose the given time interval [tin, tout] into
m pieces of equal length,
tj = tin + j∆t,
j = 0, 1, . . . , m
where ∆t := (tout −tin)/m. As pictured in Fig. 7.3 on page 417, we
consider all possible curves q : [tin, tout] →R which have the following
properties:
• The curves are piecewise linear and continuous. In other words, they
are polygonal curves in the plane.
• At the node points t0 = tin, t1, . . . , tm−1, tm = tout, the curves attain
some of the real values q1, . . . , qN.
• Both the initial point and the ﬁnal point of the curves are ﬁxed, i.e.,
q(tin) := qin,
q(tout) := qout.
The space of these curves is denoted by Π∆t(qin, qout).
(A5) Transition amplitudes: Let q ∈Π∆t(qin, qout). Suppose that the curve
has the node points
q(tr) = qj,
q(tr+1) = qk
at time tr and tr+1, respectively. We set Q(tr) := Qj and Q(tr+1) := Qk.
Then
⟨Q(tr+1)|e−i∆tH/ℏQ(tr)⟩= ⟨Qk|e−i∆t·H/ℏQj⟩.
This complex number can be written as ϱrei∆Sr[q]/ℏwith the real argu-
ment ∆Sr[q]/ℏand the modulus ϱr.

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
By the Dirac calculus, 
k=1 |Ek⟩⟨Ek| = I. Hence ⟨Q(tr+1)|e−i∆t·H/ℏQ(tr)⟩
is equal to
N

j,k=1
⟨Q(tr+1)|Ej⟩⟨Ej|e−i∆t·H/ℏ|Ek⟩⟨Ek|Q(tr)⟩.
Since ⟨Ej|e−i∆t·H/ℏ|Ek⟩= e−iEk∆t/ℏ⟨Ej|Ek⟩= e−iEk∆t/ℏδjk, we get
ϱrei∆Sr[q]/ℏ=
N

j=1
e−iEj∆t/ℏ⟨Q(tr+1)|Ej⟩⟨Ej|Q(tr)⟩.
Theorem 7.30 The magic Feynman formula (7.78) holds true.
Proof. To simplify notation, set ℏ:= 1. To begin with, let m = 2, that is,
t0 < t1 < t2, and ∆t = t1 −t0 = t2 −t1. According to the Dirac calculus,
N

j=1
|Qj⟩⟨Qj| = I.
By (7.80), the propagator satisﬁes the relation
P(t2, t0) = P(t2, t1)P(t1, t0).
Thus, Dirac’s substitution trick (7.20) yields
⟨Qout|P(t2, t0)|Qin⟩=
N

j=1
⟨Qout|P(t2, t1)Qj⟩⟨Qj|P(t1, t0)Qin⟩.
An arbitrary curve q ∈Π∆t(qin, qout) has the form
q(t0) = qin,
q(t1) = qj,
q(t2) = qout.
Therefore, the transition amplitude ⟨Qout|P(t2, t0)|Qin⟩is equal to the sum

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
⟨Q(t2)|P(t2, t1)|Q(t1)⟩⟨Q(t1)|P(t1, t0)|Q(t0)⟩
over all possible curves. This is the basic trick. This tells us that the transition
amplitude ⟨Qout|P(t2, t0)|Qin⟩is equal to

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
⟨Q(t2)|e−i∆tH|Q(t1)⟩⟨Q(t1)|e−i∆tH|Q(t0)⟩
=

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
ei(∆S1[q]+∆S2[q])ϱ1ϱ2.

This ﬁnishes the proof for m = 2. Now let m = 3, that is, t0 < t1 < t2 < t3.
By Dirac’s substitution trick, the transition amplitude ⟨Qout|P(t3, t0)|Qin⟩is
equal to
N

j,k=1
⟨Qout|P(t3, t2)Qj⟩⟨Qj|P(t2, t1)Qk⟩⟨Qk|P(t1, t0)|Qin⟩.
The proof proceeds now as above. A similar argument can be applied in the
case where m = 4, 5, . . .
2
The Feynman propagator kernel. Let us now explain the basic trick
of Feynman’s approach to quantum physics. For a given Hamiltonian H, the
dynamics of the quantum system is described by the equation
ψ(tout) = P(tout, tin)ψ(tin),
tout > tin
(7.81)
where ψ(t) denotes the state of the system at time t. Introducing the Fourier
coeﬃcients
ψj(t) := ⟨Qj|ψ(t)⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N
and the so-called Feynman propagator kernel
K(Qj, tout; Qk, tin) := ⟨Qj|P(tout, tin)Qk⟩,
we get the Feynman propagator kernel equation
ψj(tout) =
N

k=1
K(Qj, tout; Qk, tin)ψk(tin),
tout > tin
(7.82)
for j = 1, . . . , N. This equation is equivalent to (7.81). In fact, by the Dirac
calculus,
⟨Qj|ψ(tout)⟩=
N

k=1
⟨Qj|P(tout, tin)Qk⟩⟨Qk|ψ(tin)⟩.
Using the magic Feynman propagator formula (7.78), the Feynman propaga-
tor kernel can be expressed by a path integral. Explicitly,
K(Qj, tout; Qk, tin) =

q∈Π∆t(qj,qk)
eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
(7.83)
Rescaling. For a given positive number ∆q, let us consider the special
case where
qj := q1 + (j −1)∆q,
j = 1, . . . , N.
Deﬁne the rescaled states
|qj⟩:= |Qj⟩
√∆q ,
j = 1, . . . N.

422
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Introducing the discrete Dirac delta function,
δ∆q(qj −qk) := δjk
∆q ,
j, k = 1, . . . , N,
(7.84)
we get the rescaled orthogonality condition
⟨qj|qk⟩= δ∆q(qj −qk),
j, k = 1, . . . , N
along with the rescaled completeness relation
N

j=1
|qj⟩⟨qj| ∆q = I.
The magic Feynman propagator formula (7.78) now reads as
⟨qout|P(tout, tin)|qin⟩=

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
eiS[q]/ℏµ(q)(∆q)m−1.
Perspective. Roughly speaking, physicists use the formal limits
N, m →+∞,
∆t →0,
∆q →0,
q1 →−∞,
qN →+∞
in order to investigate quantum particles on the real line in terms of path
integrals. In particular, the discrete Dirac delta function passes over to the
Dirac delta function in a formal manner,
δ∆q →δ
as
∆q →0.
7.21.2 The Magic Formula for Time-Ordered Products
We now modify the magic formula (7.78) by considering the following tran-
sition amplitude:
⟨Qout|P(tout, tr)QP(tr, tin)Qin⟩=

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
q(tr)eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q]. (7.85)
This means that the physical inﬂuence of the operator Q acting at time tr can
be described simply by inserting the value of the curve q(tr) at time tr into the
path integral. Here, we use again the decomposition t0 < t1 < . . . < tm with
tin := t0 and tout := tm. Moreover, we choose tr for ﬁxed r = 1, . . . , m −1.
Theorem 7.31 Formula (7.85) holds true.

7.21 The Discrete Feynman Path Integral
423
Proof. To explain the basic idea, choose t0 < t1 < t2, and set tr := t1. By
the Dirac calculus, N
j=1 |Qj⟩⟨Qj| = I. Hence the transition amplitude
⟨Qout|P(tout, t1)QP(t1, tin)Qin⟩
is equal to
N

j,k=1
⟨Qout|P(tout, t1)Qj⟩⟨Qj|QQk⟩⟨Qk|P(t1, tin)Qin⟩.
Since ⟨Qj|QQk⟩= qk⟨Qj|Qk⟩= qkδjk, this is equal to
N

j=1
qj⟨Qout|P(tout, t1)Qj⟩⟨Qj|P(t1, tin)Qin⟩,
which is the expression for the path integral from the proof of Theorem 7.30,
up to the additional factor qj which corresponds to the value q(t1) of the
curve q at time t1.
2
The same argument applies to transition amplitudes where the operator
Q acts at diﬀerent times tr1 < tr2 < . . . < trl. For example, let tin < t1 <
. . . < tm = tout, and choose tr1 < tr2 with 1 < r1 < r2 < m. Then, the
time-ordered transition amplitude
⟨Qout|P(tout, tr2)QP(tr2, tr1)QP(tr1, tin)Qin⟩
is equal to the path integral

q∈Π∆t(qin,qout)
q(tr2)q(tr1)eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
(7.86)
The proof proceeds similarly to the proof of Theorem 7.31 by inserting the
identity N
j=1 |Qj⟩⟨Qj| = I at time tr2 and time tr1.
7.21.3 The Trace Formula
The following formula plays an important role in quantum statistics. For the
trace of the propagator P(tout, tin) = e−i(tout−tin)H/ℏ, we get
tr P(tout, tin) =

q∈Π∆t,periodic
eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
(7.87)
Here, we sum over all of the curves q ∈Π∆t(qin, qout) with qin = qout.
Proof. Set Qin := Qj and Qout := Qj for ﬁxed j = 1, . . . , N. By (7.78),
⟨Qj|P(tout, tin)Qj⟩=

Π∆t(qj,qj)
eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
Finally, note that tr P(tout, tin) = N
j=1⟨Qj|P(tout, tin)Qj⟩.

7.22 Causal Correlation Functions
It is our goal to compute causal correlation functions which lie at the heart
of quantum ﬁeld theory. Assume that the energies are ordered by
E1 ≤E2 ≤. . . ≤EN.
The least energy value E1 is also called the ground state energy (or the vac-
uum energy) of the system. For the following, we make the crucial assumption
that the ground state energy is not degenerate. By deﬁnition, this means that
the eigenvalue E1 of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) H is simple, that is,
E1 < E2 ≤. . . ≤EN.
Thus, the normalized states of least energy are of the form ϱ|E1⟩where ϱ is
a complex number with |ϱ| = 1. For arbitrary real times s < t, the causal
correlation function is deﬁned by
C(t, s) := ⟨E1|eitH/ℏQe−itH/ℏ· eisH/ℏQe−isH/ℏ|E1⟩.
This function is also called the 2-point Green’s function. Using the propaga-
tor, this can be written as
C(t, s) := ⟨E1|P(0, t)QP(t, s)QP(s, 0)|E1⟩.
In terms of physics, C(t, s) describes the correlation between quantum ﬂuc-
tuations of the ground state |E1⟩at time s and the later time t. Because of
this time-ordering, we speak of causal correlation functions. The quantum
ﬂuctuations refer to the operator Q acting at time s and the later time t.
It is our goal to reduce the computation of causal correlation functions
to simpler expressions.
This will correspond to both the magic Wick rotation formula (7.89) below
and the magic Gell-Mann–Low perturbation formula from Theorem 7.33 on
page 427. To this end, we will use the trick of Wick rotation. This trick is
based on the time transformation
τ = t(1 −εi),
t ∈R
(7.88)
for ﬁxed real parameter ε > 0. The basic idea is to simplify computations by
passing from real time t to complex time τ. In addition, we will apply the
limits
tout →+∞,
tin →−∞,
ε →+0.
Introducing the modiﬁed correlation function
Cε(t, s) := C(t(1 −εi), s(1 −εi)),
s < t,

7.22 Causal Correlation Functions
425
we obtain the following limit relation
C(t, s) = lim
ε→+0 Cε(t, s),
s < t.
We will now show how to compute the modiﬁed correlation function Cε(t, s)
by applying the limits tout →+∞and tin →−∞to appropriate transition
amplitudes.
7.22.1 The Wick Rotation Trick for Vacuum Expectation Values
We are given the states Qout and Qin as eigenstates of the linear self-adjoint
operator Q : X →X on the N-dimensional complex Hilbert space X where
1 ≤N < ∞. Assume that ⟨Qout|E1⟩̸= 0 and ⟨E1|Qin⟩̸= 0. Fix the parameter
ε > 0, and choose the real times s and t with s < t. The following formula
(7.89) is called the magic Wick rotation formula.
Theorem 7.32 The modiﬁed causal correlation function is equal to the limit
Cε(t, s) =
lim
tout→+∞
lim
tin→−∞
A
B
(7.89)
where
A := ⟨Qout|P(τout, τ)QP(τ, σ)QP(σ, τin)|Qin⟩
along with τ := t(1 −εi) and σ := s(1 −εi), and
B := ⟨Qout|P(τout, τin)|Qin⟩.
Observe that the key formula (7.89) represents the vacuum expectation
value Cε(t, s) = ⟨E1| . . . |EN⟩by the transition amplitudes A and B extended
over an inﬁnite time interval. Before proving this, let us reformulate this in
terms of path integrals. In fact, we obtain
A =

q∈Π∆τ (qin,qout)
q(τ)q(σ)eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q]
and
B =

q∈Π∆τ (qin,qout)
eiS[q]/ℏdµ[q].
These discrete path integrals are obtained from the corresponding discrete
path integrals introduced in Sect. 7.21 by replacing real time t by the complex
time t(1 −εi) for ﬁxed parameter ε > 0. In particular, t = tr1 and s = tr2 ﬁt
the decomposition of the time interval, that is, r1 < r2, and
t0 := tin < t1 < . . . < tm := tout.

7.22.2 The Magic Gell-Mann–Low Reduction Formula
The magic Dyson formula for the S-matrix and the magic Gell-Mann–
Low formula for the causal correlation functions are the key to applying
perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
Consider the typical perturbation of the Hamiltonian,
H = H0 + κV,
where H0, V : X →X are linear self-adjoint operators on the given complex
N-dimensional Hilbert space X, N = 1, 2, . . . The real constant κ ≥0 is
called the coupling constant. It is our goal to reformulate the Wick rotation
trick from the preceding section in terms of the Dyson S-matrix operator,
S(t, s) = T e−iκ
ℏ
R t
s VI(η)dη,
(7.90)
introduced in Sect. 7.18. Here, VI(t) := eitH0/ℏV e−itH0/ℏ. Let

j = 1, . . . N,
that is, |E0

of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0. In addition, assume that the ground
state of the unperturbed Hamiltonian is not degenerate, that is, the lowest
eigenvalue E0

Similarly, let
H|Ej⟩= Ej|Ej⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N,
that is, |E1⟩, . . . , |EN⟩forms a complete orthonormal system of eigenvectors
of the perturbed Hamiltonian H. Furthermore, assume that E1 is simple and
that
⟨E1|E0
1⟩̸= 0.
By classical perturbation theory, these two conditions are always satisﬁed if
the coupling constant κ is suﬃciently small.45
Theorem 7.33 We are given the real times t and s with s < t. For ﬁxed
parameter ε > 0, set τ := t(1 −εi) and σ := s(1 −εi). Then, the modiﬁed
correlation function is given by the following limit
Cε(t, s) =
lim
tout→+∞

tin→−∞
⟨E0

⟨E0
1|S(τout, τin)|E0
1⟩
.
Here, we set Q0(τ) := eiτH0/ℏQe−iτH0/ℏ.
45 As an introduction to perturbation theory, we recommend the standard text-
books by Kato (1966) and Reed, Simon (1972), Vol. 4.

428
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Mnemonically, using the time-ordering operator T
from Sect. 7.17.4,
physicists write this brieﬂy as
Cε(t, s) =
lim
tout→+∞
lim
tin→−∞
⟨E0
1|T {S(τout, τin)Q0(τ)Q0(σ)}|E0
1⟩
⟨E0
1|S(τout, τin)|E0
1⟩
.
This is called the magic Gell-Mann–Low perturbation formula. Observe the
following. The causal correlation function is given by the limit
C(t, s) = lim
ε→+0 Cε(t, s).
By Sect. 7.22, C(t, s) = ⟨E1| . . . |E1⟩, that is, the causal correlation function
refers to the ground state |E1⟩of the perturbed quantum system. In contrast
to this, the Gell-Mann–Low formula refers to the ground state |E0
1⟩of the
unperturbed (free) quantum system. Moreover, the operator Q0 = Q0(τ) only
depends on the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0. The interaction is described
by the S-operator switched on at times τ = t(1 −εi) and σ = s(1 −εi).
Proof of Theorem 7.33. This follows from Theorem 7.32 by replacing
the states |Qin⟩and |Qout⟩by |E0
1⟩. In addition, for the propagator use the
following Dyson formula (7.52), namely, P(t, s) = e−itH0/ℏS(t, s)eisH0/ℏif
t ≥s.

In Chap. 15, we will consider the operator approach to quantum ﬁeld
theory. We will start there with the magic Dyson formula (7.90) in order to
elegantly compute the S-matrix. The causal correlation functions then fol-
low from the magic Gell-Mann–Low formula. In the following two sections,
as an alternative, we will consider the rigorous response approach based on
Gaussian integrals and discrete functional integrals. The corresponding ap-
plications to quantum ﬁeld theory will be studied in Chap. 14.
7.23 The Magic Gaussian Integral
The most important probability distribution is the Gaussian distribution.
Folklore
Quantum theory is a stochastic theory. Therefore, it is not a big surprise
that the Gaussian distribution plays a fundamental role in quantum physics.
The following formulas are frequently used by physicists when computing
Feynman functional integrals.

which is valid for all complex numbers p. This magic formula tells us that
the Gaussian function e−x2/2 is invariant under Fourier transformation. The
integral (7.91) exists in the classical sense because of the damping factor
e−x2/2. The proof will be given in Problem 7.1.
Use now the rescaling x →√a x and p →p/√a. Then, for all a > 0 and

The Dirac delta distribution. In what follows we will use the space
S(R) (resp. D(R)) of smooth test functions χ : R →C which go rapidly

Φ′(x0) = 0.

which follows from (7.94). This is the key to the method of stationary phase to
be studied in Sect. 12.5.3 in connection with geometric optics, by generalizing
Fresnel integrals. In particular, it turns out that formula (7.98) remains valid
if we replace h by ±ih. We then get

(7.99) is rapidly oscillating. Therefore, the contributions of the integrand to
the integral cancel each other, except at the position x = 0 where the rapid
oscillations do not appear.
Physicists use the method of stationary phase in order to compute semi-
classical approximations of quantum eﬀects where the Planck constant ℏis
assumed to be small. More precisely, we assume that S(x)/ℏis small, where
S(x) denotes the classical action. Applications of this so-called WKB method
for computing semiclassical approximations of the Feynman propagator ker-
nel can be found in both Kleinert (1996) and Grosche, Steiner (1996). It
turns out that the topology of the corresponding classical dynamical system
(focal points, closed orbits) plays a fundamental role in terms of the Maslov
index. Summarizing, for an important class of interactions, the method of
stationary phase allows us to compute the most important contributions to
the corresponding physical processes.

By (7.92),

the nth moment vanishes if n is odd. Physicists call this the moment trick or

Case 2: Let a > 0 and b ∈R. The integral G(a+ib) exists, and the function

fact, the derivative of G can be computed as in Problem 7.1. Formula (7.103)
follows now from (7.104) by means of analytic continuation.
Case 3: Let a ≤0 and b ̸= 0. Then, the integral G(a+bi) does not exist in
the classical sense. However, we can deﬁne it in a generalized sense by means

7.23.5 The Method of Stationary Phase
First prototype. For N = 1, 2, . . . and each ﬁxed real number η > 0, let us
consider the integral
W(J) :=

RN eΦ(ϕ,J) e−ηϕdϕdϕ1 · · · dϕN
with the phase function
Φ(ϕ, J) := 1
2iϕdAϕ + iϕdJ.
Here, ϕ and J are given by (7.106). We will show below that under suitable
assumptions, the functional Φ has a unique critical point ϕ0 depending on J,
and

436
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
W(J) = eΦ(ϕ0,J)W(0).
Explicitly,
W(J) = e−1
2 iJdA−1JW(0)
(7.110)
for all real numbers J1, . . . , JN.
Theorem 7.35 Let A be a complex symmetric invertible (N × N)-matrix
such that
sup
ϕ∈RN |eiϕdAϕ| < ∞.
(7.111)
Then, equation (7.110) holds true.
In particular, this implies
lim
η→+0
W(J)
W(0) = e−1
2 iJdA−1J.
(7.112)
For example, condition (7.111) is satisﬁed if A := D + iεI where the matrix
D is real and ε ≥0. In fact, then
|eiϕdAϕ| = |eiϕdAϕ| · e−εϕdϕ = e−εϕdϕ.
Proof. (I) The integral
W(J) =

RN e
1
2 iϕdAϕ eiϕdJ e−ηϕdϕ dϕ1 · · · dϕN
exists because of the damping factor e−ηϕdϕ.
(II) Critical point of the phase function Φ. For ﬁxed ϕ0, h and J, deﬁne
χ(τ) := Φ(ϕ0 + τh, J),
τ ∈R.
The function χ is quadratic. By Taylor expansion,
χ(1) = χ(0) + χ′(0) + 1
2χ′′(0).
(7.113)
Choose ϕ0 in such a way that it is a critical point of Φ, that is, χ′(0) = 0 for
all h. Since A is symmetric, we get
χ′(0) = 1
2ihdAϕ0 + 1
2iϕd
0Ah + ihdJ = ihd(A + J)ϕ0 = 0
for all h ∈RN. Hence Aϕ0 + J = 0. This so-called response equation has the
unique solution
ϕ0 = −A−1J.
(7.114)

7.23 The Magic Gaussian Integral
437
Since the matrix A−1 is symmetric, ϕd
0 = −JdA−1. Setting h := ϕ −ϕ0, it
follows from (7.113) that
Φ(ϕ) = Φ(ϕ0 + h) = Φ(ϕ0) + 1
2χ′′(0).
This implies
W(J) = eΦ(ϕ0,J)

RN e
1
2 χ′′(0) e−ηϕdϕdϕ1 · · · dϕN.
If J = 0, then Φ(ϕ0) = Φ(0) = 0. Since the J-term of the function Φ is linear
with respect to ϕ, the second derivative χ′′(0) does not depend on J. Thus,
W(0) =

RN e
1
2 χ′′(0) e−ηϕdϕdϕ1 · · · dϕN.

W(J, J) = e−iJA−1J W(0, 0)
for all real numbers J1, . . . , JN, J1, . . . , JN, and all η > 0.
In particular, this implies
lim
η→+0
W(J, J)
W(0, 0) = e−iJA−1J.
(7.116)
Proof. For ﬁxed ψ0, ψ0, h, h, J, J, set
χ(τ) := Φ(ψ0 + τh, ψ0 + τh, J, J),

Note that
χ′(0) = ih(Aψ0 + J) + i(ψ0A + J)h.
If we choose
ψ0 := −A−1J,
ψ0 := −JA−1,
then χ′(0) = 0. As in the proof of Theorem 7.35, we get
W(J, J) = eΦ(ψ0,ψ0,J,J) W(0, 0)
where W(0, 0) depends on η. Finally,
Φ(ψ0, ψ0, J, J) = iJA−1J −2iJA−1J = −iJA−1J.

7.24.1 Basic Ideas
Classical ﬁelds are described by the principle of critical action. The uni-
versal response approach to quantum ﬁeld theory combines the principle of
critical action with the random aspects of inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian in-
tegrals. The idea is to study the response of the quantum ﬁeld under the
inﬂuence of an external source. In this section, we will rigorously study a
ﬁnite-dimensional variant of the response approach. The notation will be
chosen in such a way that the formal continuum limit can be carried out
in a straightforward manner in Chap. 14. The basic idea is to introduce the
so-called extended quantum action functional Z(J, ϕ) which depends on both
the quantum ﬁeld ϕ and the external source J and to derive two magic for-
mulas, namely,
(QA) the quantum action reduction formula, and
(LSZ) the Lehmann–Szymanzik–Zimmermann reduction formula on the re-
lation between correlation functions
Cn(x1, . . . , xn)
and scattering functions Sn(x1, . . . , xn).
The main steps of our approach are the following ones.
(i) The principle of critical action. The point is that the classical action
functional
S[ϕ, J]
depends on both the classical quantum ﬁeld ϕ and the external source
J. This yields the Euler–Lagrange equation of the motion of the classical
quantum ﬁeld under the inﬂuence of the external source. See (7.122) on
page 446.
(ii) The response operator. The linearized (and regularized) Euler–Lagrange
equation determines the response operator Rε which describes the re-
sponse
ϕ = RεJ
of the interaction-free classical quantum ﬁeld ϕ to the external source
J. See (7.125) on page446. The small parameter ε > 0 regularizes the
response. It turns out that the response operator Rε knows all about the
full quantum ﬁeld. To this end, we will use the two magic formulas (QA)
and (LSZ).
(iii) The quantum action reduction formula (QA). The response operator Rε
determines the free generating functional
Zfree(J, ϕ).
The formula (QA) tells us how the corresponding generating functional

440
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Z(J, ϕ)
of the interacting quantum ﬁeld can be obtained from the free functional
Zfree(J, ϕ) by functional diﬀerentiation. See (7.127) on page 448. Note
that the key formula (QA) is valid in each order of perturbation theory
with respect to the coupling constant κ.
The magic formula (QA) describes the quantization of the clas-
sical quantum ﬁeld ϕ.
(iv) The n-point correlation function Cn. It is our philosophy that
The main properties of a quantum ﬁeld are described by the se-
quence of correlation functions C2, C4, . . .
These functions are obtained from Z(J, 0) by using functional diﬀerenti-
ation at the point J = 0. See (7.129) on page 448.
(v) The n-point scattering functions Sn. These functions are obtained by
applying functional diﬀerentiation to Z(0, ϕ) at the point ϕ = 0. See
(7.130) on page 449. The scattering functions know all about scattering
processes.
(vi) The LSZ reduction formula. This fundamental formula tells us how to
compute the n-point scattering function Sn by means of the n-point cor-
relation function Cn.
(vii) The local quantum action principle. The formula (QA) is the solution
formula to the Dyson–Schwinger equation (7.133) on page 452 which is
called the local quantum action principle.
We will use ﬁnite functional integrals in order to derive rigorously the magic
formulas (QA) and (LSZ) by using the quite natural global quantum action
principle.
The global quantum action principle is based on an averaging over
the classical ﬁelds where the statistical weight eiS[ϕ,J]/ℏdepends on
the classical action S[ϕ, J].
The explicit formulation can be found in Sect. 7.24.5 on page 447. However,
the response approach can also be formulated in such a way that functional in-
tegrals do not appear explicitly. This is important for the inﬁnite-dimensional
approach, since functional integrals are not well-deﬁned in inﬁnite dimen-
sions.
The basic idea is then to start with the deﬁnition of the extended
quantum action functional Z = Z(J, ϕ) and to deﬁne the correlation
functions Cn and the scattering functions Sn as functional derivatives
of Z(ϕ, J).
In what follows, we will investigate the basic ideas sketched in (i) through
(vii) above in a rigorous setting. The translation to quantum ﬁelds with an
inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom will be studied in Chap. 14 (response
approach) and Chap. 15 (operator approach).

7.24.2 Discrete Space-Time Manifold
According to Einstein, the physics in an inertial system depends on space-
time points
x = (x, ct)
where x and t denote position vector and time, respectively. Moreover, c is
the velocity of light in a vacuum. The set of all space-time points x forms
the 4-dimensional space-time manifold M4. In this section, we use a ﬁnite-
dimensional set
M = (1, 2, . . . , N)
as discrete space-time manifold where N = 1, 2, . . .. Furthermore, we ﬁx a
real number ∆x > 0, and we set ∆4x := (∆x)4. Each function
ϕ : M →R
is called a discrete quantum ﬁeld, and each function J : M →R is called an
external source. In the language of matrices, we write
ϕ =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ϕ1

J =

Discrete integral. For each function f : M →R, the sum

x∈M
f(x)∆4x
is called a ﬁnite integral on M. The space of all functions f : M →R becomes
a real N-dimensional Hilbert space with respect to the inner product
⟨f|g⟩:=

x∈M
f(x)g(x)∆4x.

The linear operator A : L2(M) →L2(M) is called a discrete integral operator
with the kernel A. Obviously, each linear operator A on L2(M) is a discrete
integral operator. This statement is not true anymore in inﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces. This fact causes trouble in inﬁnite dimensions.
Discrete Dirac delta function. Let δx,x := 1 and δx,y := 0 if x ̸= y.

Naturally enough, we assume that the classical integral exists on the right-

Terminology. Let us summarize the basic notions to be introduced be-
low. The starting point will be the classical action functional S[ϕ, J]. The
principle of critical action yields the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion for
the quantum ﬁeld ϕ under the inﬂuence of the external source J.
The fundamental quantum action principal deﬁnes the quantum ac-
tion functional
Z(J) :=

x∈M eiS[ϕ,J]/ℏe−η⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩Dϕ

x∈M eiS[ϕ,0]/ℏe−η⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩Dϕ
as a functional integral depending on the classical action functional
S[ϕ, J] and by averaging over all possible quantum ﬁelds ϕ.
Here, we introduce the ﬁxed small parameter η > 0 in order to force the
convergence of the integrals. The quantum action functional Z = Z(J) is
normalized by the condition Z(0) = 1. The quantum action functional Z(J)
is related to quantum ﬂuctuations that are added to the classical quantum
ﬁeld. These quantum ﬂuctuations are described by correlation functions. In
addition, we will introduce the extended quantum action functional
Z = Z(J, ϕ)
in (7.127) below. The relation between the function Z = Z(J) and the ex-
tended function Z = Z(J, ϕ) will be given by

444
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Z(J) = Z(J, 0)
Z(0, 0).
To simplify notation, we will use the same symbol Z for both Z(J) and
Z(J, ϕ). Using the extended function Z = Z(J, ϕ), we also introduce the
scattering functional
S(ϕ) := Z(0, ϕ)
Z(0, 0) .
This way, Z(J) and S(ϕ) are dual quantities along with the normalization
condition Z(0) = S(0) = 1. For describing the crucial properties of quantum
ﬁelds we will use the following functions:
(i) the n-point correlation function Cn = Cn(x1, . . . , xn);
(ii) the n-point scattering function Sn = Sn(x1, . . . , xn);
(iii) the causal n-point correlation function Cn = Cn(x1, . . . , xn), and
(iv) the n-point vertex function Vn = Vn(x1, . . . , xn).
By deﬁnition,
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) :=
	ℏ
i

n
δnZ(J)
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn)|J=0
and
Sn(x1, . . . , xn) :=
δnS(ϕ)
δϕ(x1) · · · δϕ(xn)| ϕ=0 .
Here, Z = Z(J) and S = S(ϕ) are called generating functionals. Switching oﬀ
the interaction by putting the coupling constant to zero, κ = 0, the correlation
function Cn passes over to the so-called free correlation function, Cn,free.
Quantum ﬁeld theory can be based on two magic formulas (QA) and (LSZ).
Let us brieﬂy discuss this.
(QA) The quantum action formula reduces the correlation function Cn to
the free correlation functions C02, C04, . . . In addition, the free correlation
functions are determined by the response function which describes the
solution ϕ = RεJ of the linearized (and regularized) equation of motion
with the regularization parameter ε > 0.
(LSZ) The Lehmann–Szymanzik–Zimmermann formula reduces the scatter-
ing function Sn to the correlation function Cn.
We will show in Sect. 14.2.5 that the scattering function Sm+n allows us to
compute the S-matrix elements. This yields the essential information about
scattering processes of m incoming particles and n outgoing particles.
The causal correlation function Cn was introduced in Sect. 7.22. We will
show in Chap. 15 on the operator approach to quantum ﬁeld theory that
Cn = Cn for all n.
The function Cn is also called the n-point Green’s function.

7.24 The Rigorous Response Approach to Finite Quantum Fields
445
In the literature, one uses the notations Gn or τn for Cn synonymously. The
n-point vertex function Vn is deﬁned in terms of the correlation function
Cn. The vertex functions extract important information from the correlation
functions. The local quantum action principle tells us that the functional
derivatives
δZ(J)
δJ(x) ,
x ∈M
satisfy an equation which is called the Dyson–Schwinger equation.
Warning. For historical reasons, the physical quantity ‘action’ is denoted
by the letter S. In 1943 Heisenberg introduced the S-matrix. Here, the letter
S refers to ‘scattering’. We will use the italic symbol S[ϕ] and the san-serif
symbol S(ϕ) in order to distinguish between the action functional and the
scattering functional, respectively.
7.24.3 The Principle of Critical Action
We are given the action
S[ϕ, J] :=

x∈M
L(ϕ)(x)∆4x
(7.119)
along with the Lagrangian density
L(ϕ)(x) := 1
2ϕ(x)(Dϕ)(x) + 1
2iεϕ(x)2 + κLint(ϕ)(x) + ϕ(x)J(x).
In terms of the inner product on L2(M), the action looks like
S[ϕ, J] = 1
2⟨ϕ|(D + iεI)ϕ⟩+ κ⟨1|Lint(ϕ)⟩+ ⟨ϕ|J⟩.
(7.120)
In the following sections, the response approach is essentially based on the ac-
tion S[ϕ, J] of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ. This action depends on the ﬁxed external
source J. We make the following assumptions:
• The functions ϕ and J lie in the space L2(M).
• The operator D : L2(M) →L2(M) is linear and self-adjoint.
• There exists a real number ε0 > 0 such that the inverse operator
(D + iεI)−1 : L2(M) →L2(M)
exists for all ε ∈]0, ε0[.
• We ﬁx the coupling constant κ ≥0, and we assume that the function
Lint : R →R is a polynomial with real coeﬃcients (e.g., Lint(χ) = −χ4).
The nonlinear term κLint with κ > 0 describes interactions.
Theorem 7.37 The problem of critical action,
S[ϕ, J] = critical!,
ϕ ∈L2(M),

is equivalent to the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion,
(Dϕ)(x) + iεϕ(x) + κL′
int(ϕ)(x) + J(x) = 0
(7.122)
for all x ∈M. This equation of motion is equivalent to
δS[ϕ, J]
δϕ(x)

for all x ∈M.
(7.123)
.
Proof. Fix h ∈L2(M). Introduce the function
χ(τ) := S[ϕ + τh, J]
for all
τ ∈R.
By deﬁnition, problem (7.121) is equivalent to
χ′(0) = 0
for all
h ∈L2(M).
Recall that
S[ϕ, J] = 1
2⟨ϕ|Dϕ⟩+ 1
2iε⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩+ ⟨ϕ|J⟩+ κ

x∈M
Lint(ϕ)(x)∆4x.
Therefore, the derivative χ′(0) is equal to

2⟨ϕ|Dh⟩+ iε⟨h|ϕ⟩+ ⟨h|J⟩+ κ

x∈M
L′
int(ϕ)(x)h(x)∆4x.
Since ⟨ϕ|Dh⟩= ⟨Dϕ|h⟩= ⟨h|Dϕ⟩,
⟨h|Dϕ + iεϕ + J + κL′
int(ϕ)⟩= 0
for all
h ∈L2(M).
This implies (7.122). Furthermore,
δS[ϕ, J]
δϕ(x) (h) = χ′(0) =

x∈M
δS[ϕ, J]
δϕ(x)
h(x)∆4x = 0

7.24.4 The Response Function
Set κ = 0. The linearized equation of motion
Dϕ + iεϕ = −J
(7.124)
is called the response equation. For a suﬃciently small parameter ε > 0,
equation (7.124) has the unique solution
ϕ = −(D + iεI)−1J.
We set Rε := −(D + iεI)−1. Then ϕ = RεJ. We write
ϕ(x) =

y∈M
Rε(x, y)J(y)∆4y,
x ∈M.

The kernel Rε of the response operator Rε is called the response function.

Z(J) :=

L2(M) eiS[ϕ,0]/ℏe−η⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩Dϕ .

2ℏ{ϕ(k)(Dϕ)(k) + 2κLint(ϕ)(k)} −ε
2ℏϕ(k)2.
These are classical integrals over the N real variables ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(N). The
damping factors e−εϕ(k)2/2ℏand e−ηϕ(k)2 with ε, η > 0 and k = 1, . . . , N
guarantee the existence of these integrals.47 Motivated by the theory of prob-
ability, we call Cn the n-moment function or the n-correlation function. In
particular, we get the following.
(i) Cn(x1, . . . , xN) ≡0 if n = 1, 3, 5, . . .
(ii) Cn(x1, . . . , xn) is symmetric with respect to the variables x1, . . . , xn if
n = 2, 4, 6, . . .
47 Since the matrix D is real, |eiϕ(k)(Dϕ)(k)| = 1.

Observe that, in contrast to the deﬁnition of Z(J) above, the extended func-
tional Z(J, ϕ) is formulated without using functional integrals. This func-
tional only depends on the response function Rε. In particular, for vanishing
coupling constant, κ = 0, we get Z(J, ϕ) = Zfree(J, ϕ).
Theorem 7.38 For each source J ∈L2(M), the quantum action functional
is given by
Z(J) = Z(J, 0)
Z(0, 0).
(7.128)
This so-called magic quantum action formula (QA) reduces the com-
putation of the quantum action functional Z(J) to the response function
Rε = Rε(x, y), by (7.127). Note that equation (7.127) is to be understood
in the sense of a formal power series expansion with respect to the coupling
constant κ. This means that the left-hand side and the right-hand side of
(7.127) are formal power series expansions with identical complex coeﬃcients.
Consequently, equation (7.127) represents a rigorous relation in each order
of perturbation theory with respect to κ. This follows from our assumption
that Lint(ζ) is a polynomial with respect to the variable ζ. Recall that the
correlation functions are given by the following functional derivatives

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Theorem 7.39 For all x1, . . . , xn ∈M and n = 1, 2, . . ., we have the fol-
lowing LSZ reduction formula:
Sn(x1, . . . , xn) =
1
(iℏ)n {(Dx1 + iεI) · · · (Dxn + iεI)Cn} (x1, . . . , xn).
This fundamental formula relates the scattering function Sn to the cor-
relation function Cn. Here, the symbol Dxk stands for the linear operator
D from the equation of motion (7.122) on page 446 which acts on the kth
variable of the correlation function Cn.
Proof. The proof is an elementary consequence of both the chain rule for
partial derivatives and the relation
Rε(D + iε)−1 = −I.
In order to simplify notation, we write D and R instead of D + iε and Rε,
respectively.
Step 1: To understand the simple idea of the proof, let us start with the
case where N = 1. Then
Zfree(J, ϕ) := eiRJ2/2ℏeiϕJ/ℏ,
ϕ, J ∈R.
Moreover, D and R are nonzero real numbers. Let us also introduce the

true for n = 2.
(iii) For n = 3, 4, . . . , the proof of (7.131) proceeds analogously, by induction.
Step 2: Let N = 2, 3, . . . In contrast to Step 1, we now have to use partial
derivatives with respect to the real variables J(1), . . . , J(N), ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(N).

(7.138)
This is a consequence of Step 3. The proof for matrices can be found in
Problem 7.4 on page 494. The proof of (7.138) proceeds analogously to the
proof for matrices. Note that (7.138) is to be understood in the sense of
formal power series expansions with respect to κ. Using Step 2 and Step 4,
we get the key relation (7.136).

7.24.9 Simplifying the Computation of Quantum Eﬀects
We have seen that correlation functions know all about quantum ﬁelds includ-
ing scattering processes via the LSZ reduction formula. However, as a rule,
the computation of concrete physical eﬀects is lengthy and time consuming.
Therefore, physicists have invented tools in order to simplify computations,
namely,
(i) the family of reduced correlation functions and
(ii) the mean ﬁeld approach (averaged quantum ﬂuctuations).
Reduced correlation functions. The basic idea is to start with so-
called reduced correlation functions which allow us the computation of the
correlation functions. Schematically,

7.24 The Rigorous Response Approach to Finite Quantum Fields
455
response function ⇒reduced correlation functions ⇒
⇒correlation functions ⇒scattering functions (S matrix).
The S matrix knows all about scattering processes.
Mean ﬁeld approach. In order to get typical information about the
inﬂuence of quantum ﬂuctuations, we average the quantum ﬂuctuations over
all possible classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Schematically,
• classical ﬁeld ϕ ⇒mean ﬁeld ϕmean;
• classical action S[ϕ, J] ⇒eﬀective quantum action Seﬀ;
• response function ⇒vertex functional V ⇒eﬀective quantum action
Seﬀ= V (ϕmean).
The eﬀective quantum action depends on the vertex functional V which
can be described by vertex functions V (x1, . . . , xn), n = 1, 2, . . .
From the computational point of view, note the following.
The computations concerning the reduced correlation functions and
the mean ﬁeld approach depend on the coupling constant κ, and they
can be carried out in each order of perturbation theory.
7.24.10 Reduced Correlation Functions
Since Z(0) = 1, it makes sense to deﬁne the reduced quantum action func-
tional by
Zred(J) := ln Z(J).
Hence
Z(J) = eZred(J).
Parallel to the n-correlation functions, we introduce the so-called n-correlation
functions
Cn,reduced(x1, . . . , xn) =
	ℏ
i

n
δnZred(J)
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn),
n = 1, 2, . . .
The reduced correlation functions simplify the computation of correlation
functions. Examples will be considered in Prop. 7.45 on page 472. Roughly
speaking, the reduced correlation functions have the advantage that they
do not contain contributions that arise trivially from the multiplication of
correlation functions of lower order.

7.24.11 The Mean Field Approximation
In physics, eﬀective quantities can be obtained by averaging.
Folklore
The classical ﬁeld. Fix the external source J. By the equation of motion
(7.122) on page 446, the classical ﬁeld ϕ satisﬁes the following (discrete)
integral equation:
ϕ(x) =

y∈M
Rε(x, y) {J(y) + κL′
int(ϕ)(y)} ∆4y.
(7.139)
The kernel of this integral equation is the response function Rε. Setting κ = 0,
we obtain the classical free ﬁeld
ϕfree(x) =

y∈M
Rε(x, y)J(y)∆4y.
We now compute the interacting ﬁeld by the following iterative method
ϕn+1(x) = ϕfree(x) + κ

y∈M
Rε(x, y)L′
int(ϕn)(y)∆4y,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with the free ﬁeld as initial approximation, that is, we set ϕ0 := ϕfree. This
yields the ﬁrst approximation
ϕ1(x) = ϕfree(x) + κ

y∈M
Rε(x, y)L′
int(ϕfree)(y)∆4y.
Quantum ﬁelds diﬀer from classical ﬁelds by adding quantum eﬀects. Intu-
itively, we have to add quantum ﬂuctuations. The complete theory is based
on the quantum action principle considered in Sect. 7.24.6 on page 448. At
this point, we want to discuss a simpliﬁed version of the complete theory
based on the averaging of quantum eﬀects.
Averaging quantum ﬂuctuations. Fix the external source J and deﬁne
ϕmean(x) :=
ℏ
iZ(J)
δZ(J)
δJ(x) ,
x ∈M.
This is called the mean ﬁeld approximation of the classical ﬁeld (7.139) cor-
responding to J. To justify this terminology, note that the global quantum
action principle (7.126) on page 447 implies that
ϕmean(x) =

L2(M) ϕ(x)eiS[ϕ,J]/ℏ· e−η⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩Dϕ

L2(M) eiS[ϕ,J]/ℏ· e−η⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩Dϕ
.
Thus, the mean ﬁeld ϕmean is obtained by averaging over all possible classical
ﬁelds ϕ. Note that the mean ﬁeld ϕmean depends on the choice of the external
source J and the small damping parameter η > 0.

7.24 The Rigorous Response Approach to Finite Quantum Fields
457
The relation between the mean ﬁeld and the reduced quantum
action functional. Using the reduced quantum action functional, the mean
ﬁeld is given by
ϕmean(x) = ℏ

δZred(J)
δJ(x) .
(7.140)
Switching oﬀthe coupling constant, κ = 0, we have

int(ϕ)(y)∆4y.
From the physical point of view, the quantum ﬁeld diﬀers from the classical
ﬁeld by quantum corrections.
The mean ﬁeld ϕmean can be regarded as a ﬁeld which diﬀers from
the classical ﬁeld by adding the average of quantum corrections.
In what follows we will use the Legendre transformation in order to introduce
vertex functions and the eﬀective action of a quantum ﬁeld.
7.24.12 Vertex Functions and the Eﬀective Action
The Legendre transformation. Equation (7.140) deﬁnes a map
(J(1), . . . , J(N)) →(ϕmean(1), . . . , ϕmean(N))
(7.141)
from the external sources to the mean ﬁelds. Let us assume that this map is a
diﬀeomorphism from RN onto RN. This means that there exists a one-to-one
relation between external sources and mean ﬁelds. Let us write this map as
ϕmean = ϕmean(J).

458
7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
Conversely, J = J(ϕmean). Our goal is to replace external sources, J, by
mean ﬁelds, ϕmean according to (7.141). In classical mechanics, one uses the
Legendre transformation in order to pass from velocity to momentum and
from the Lagrangian density to the Hamiltonian function. Parallel to this
classical tool, let us introduce the Legendre transformation
J →ϕmean,
Zred(J) →V (ϕmean)
given by (7.140) and
V (ϕmean) := ℏ
i Zred(J) −

x∈M
ϕmean(x)J(x)∆4x.
The functional V is called the vertex functional.
Proposition 7.41 We have
δV (ϕmean)
δϕmean(x) = −J(x)
where the source J is related to the mean ﬁeld ϕmean by the Legendre trans-
formation (7.141) above.
Proof. For the total diﬀerential,
dV =

x∈M
∂V (ϕmean)
∂ϕmean(x) dϕmean(x).
Furthermore,
dV =


x∈M
{J(x)dϕmean(x) + ϕmean(x)dJ(x)}∆4x.
By (7.140), the terms with dJ(x) compensate each other. Hence
dV = −

x∈M
J(x)dϕmean(x) ∆4x.
This implies
δV (ϕmean)
δϕmean(x) =
1
∆4x
∂V (ϕmean)
∂ϕmean(x) = −J(x).

Vertex functions. Let us deﬁne
Vn(x1, . . . , xn) :=
δnV (ϕ)
δϕ(x1) · · · δϕ(xn)| ϕ=0.

7.25 The Discrete ϕ4-Model and Feynman Diagrams
459
These functions are called vertex functions. The quantum action functional
Z(J) can be expressed by the vertex functional. Explicitly,
Z(J) = ei(V (ϕmean)+⟨ϕmean|J⟩)/ℏ.
(7.142)
Here, the source J is related to the mean ﬁeld ϕmean by the Legendre trans-
formation (7.141).
The eﬀective quantum action. Switching oﬀthe interaction, κ = 0,
we get ϕmean = ϕfree, and
V (ϕfree) =

x∈M
1
2ϕfree(x)(Dϕfree + iεϕfree)(x)∆4x.
(7.143)
This is the classical action functional with vanishing source term. To prove
(7.143), note that
V (ϕfree) = ℏ
i Zfree,red(J) −⟨ϕfree|J⟩= 1
2⟨J|RεJ⟩−⟨ϕfree|J⟩.
Since ϕfree = RεJ, we get V (ϕfree) = −1
2⟨J|RεJ⟩. Finally, it follows from
J = R−1
ε ϕfree that
V (ϕfree) = −1
2⟨R−1
ε ϕfree|ϕfree⟩= 1
2⟨(D + iεI)ϕfree|ϕfree⟩.
This proves (7.143). Now consider the case of general coupling constant,
κ ≥0. We deﬁne
Seﬀ[ϕmean] := V (ϕmean)
and call this the eﬀective action of the quantum ﬁeld. This deﬁnition is mo-
tivated by equation (7.143).
The eﬀective quantum action adds the average of quantum corrections
to the classical action.
7.25 The Discrete ϕ4-Model and Feynman Diagrams
It is our goal to apply the preceding response approach to a special discrete
model, which is obtained from the continuum ϕ4-model by replacing the
Fourier transform by the discrete Fourier transform.
The continuum ϕ4-model. Set x = (x, ct). Let
ϕ = ϕ(x)
be a real-valued function ϕ : R4 →R which depends on the position vector
x and time t. The solution ϕ of the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation

with the coupling constant κ ≥0 and the regularization parameter ε > 0.
The given smooth function J : R4 →R describes an external source. The

is called the wave operator. The action functional of the meson reads as
S[ϕ, J] :=

Ω
L(ϕ, ∂ϕ, J) d4x
with the Lagrangian density
L(ϕ, J) := 1
2ϕ(D + iε)ϕ + κLint(ϕ) + ϕJ
where we set D := −ℏ22 −m2
0c2. Because of
Lint(ϕ) := −ϕ4,
we speak of the ϕ4-model. Recall that the closure cl(Ω) of the open set Ω
is obtained from Ωby adding the boundary ∂Ω. The quantity S has the
physical dimension of action which equals the product of energy with time.
Theorem 7.42 Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of R4. Then, each
smooth solution ϕ : cl(Ω) →R of the variational problem
S[ϕ, J] = critical!
(7.145)
with the boundary condition ϕ = 0 on ∂Ωsatisﬁes equation (7.144) on Ω.
This is called the principle of critical action for the meson equation (7.144).
Proof. Let D(Ω) denote the space of all smooth functions h : Ω→R which
vanish outside a compact subset of Ω. In particular, if h ∈D(Ω), then h = 0
on ∂Ω. Let ϕ be a solution of (7.145). Fix h ∈D(Ω), and set
χ(τ) := S[ϕ + τh, J]
for all
τ ∈R.
By deﬁnition, problem (7.145) is equivalent to
χ′(0) = 0
for all
h ∈D(Ω).
This means that

Ω

2ϕDh + h(iεϕ −4κϕ3 + J) d4x = 0

for all h ∈D(Ω). Using integration by parts, we obtain

Ω
h(Dϕ + iεϕ −4κϕ3 + J) d4x = 0
for all
h ∈D(Ω).
This implies
Dϕ + iεϕ −4κϕ3 + J = 0
on Ω,
by the variational lemma on page 542.

Let ϕ ∈S(R4), that is, the smooth function ϕ : R4 →C goes rapidly to
zero at inﬁnity.48 Introducing the momentum vector p, the energy E, and
the 4-momentum vector p := (p, E/c) along with
px := Et −xp,
the Fourier–Minkowski transform of the function ϕ reads as
ˆϕ(p) :=
1
4π2ℏ2

R4 ϕ(x)eipx/ℏd4x.
The inverse transformation is given by
ϕ(x) :=
1
4π2ℏ2

R4 ϕ(x)e−ipx/ℏd4p.
Using the Fourier–Minkowski transform, the equation
(−ℏ22 −m2
0c2 + iε)ϕ(x) = f(x),
x ∈R4
passes over to
(p2 −m2
0c2 + iε) ˆϕ(p) = ˆf(p),

(7.146)
with c2p2 = E2 −c2p2. Hence

( ˆ
Dε ˆϕ)(p) = (p2 −m2

p ∈R4.
(7.148)
The set of all 4-momentum vectors p ∈R4 with
p2 −c2m2
0 = 0
is called the mass hyperboloid or the mass shell of the meson. Explicitly, this
means that
E2 = c2p2 + m2
0c4,
which is the relation between energy E and momentum vector p of a free
meson. Note that equation (7.148) makes sense, since ε > 0. However, in
the critical case where ε = 0, the operator ˆR0 is singular if p lives on the
mass shell. This is the reason for introducing the regularization term iεϕ
into the meson equation (7.144). The relation of the response operator to
the Feynman propagator for the Klein–Gordon equation will be considered
in Sect. 14.2.2 on page 775.
Discretization. It is our goal to introduce a lattice approximation of the
meson model above by discretizing space, time, momentum, and energy. To
this end, we choose real numbers ∆x > 0, ∆p > 0 and a natural number
nmax. We will introduce the notation in such a way that the limit
∆x →0,
∆p →0,
nmax →+∞
yields the continuum model. To this end, we choose a right-handed orthonor-
mal system e1, e2, e3. For integers nµ = 0, ±1, . . ., ±nmax with µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
we set
x = (n1e1 + n2e2 + n3e3)∆x,
ct = n0∆x.
This way, we obtain a ﬁnite number x(1), . . . , x(N) of space-time points living
in R4. To simplify notation, we write

x∈M
f(x)∆4x :=
N

k=1
f(k)∆4x,
that is, we identify x(1), . . . , x(N) with 1, . . . , N, respectively. Recall that
∆4x := (∆x)4. Similarly, we set
p = (n1e1 + n2e2 + n3e3)∆p,
E = n0c∆p.
This yields the ﬁnite number p(1), . . . , p(N) of 4-momentum vectors. We
write ∆4p := (∆p)4, and

By a discrete Fourier transform, we understand a linear transformation

Let D : L2(M) →L2(M) be a linear operator. The equation

The discrete ϕ4-model. As a discretization of the continuum ϕ4-model
above, we use the discrete model from Sect. 7.24.3 on page 445 along with
the following special choices.
(i) Interaction: We set Lint(χ) := −χ4. Then, L′
int(χ) = −4χ3.
(ii) The linear operator D: Let ε > 0. We deﬁne D + iεI := U −1( ˆD + iεI)U
along with the Fourier transform

ϕ4-model can be found in Table 7.1 on page 469.

Ad (i). Since Zfree,red is quadratic with respect to J, the functional
Zfree(J) = eZfree,red(J)
contains only terms of even degree with respect to J.

By (7.150), C2,free(x, y) = −iℏRε(x, y).

The function f is not symmetric with respect to the variables x1, x2, x3, x4.
Therefore, we have to symmetrize. Since C2,free(x, y) is symmetric with re-

C2,free(xi1, xi2) · · · C2,free(xin−1, xin).
Here, we sum over all permutations of x1, . . . , xn in such a restricted way that
the pairs are always ordered, that is il < il+1 for all l. The corresponding
Feynman diagrams are obtained by drawing n nodes and by connecting all
possible pairs. Since the node x1 can be connected with the other n−1 nodes,
it follows by induction that there are 1 × 3 × · · · × (n −1) Feynman diagrams

for n = 2, 4, . . . . The Feynman graph to C2,free is connected, whereas the
graphs to Cn,free with n = 4, 6, 8, . . . are not always connected.
Summary of properties of the free ﬁeld. For the convenience of the
reader, let us summarize typical quantities of the free ﬁeld. Below we will
generalize this to the case of interacting ﬁelds with κ > 0.
• Free reduced 2-point correlation function:
C2,free,red(x1, x2) = C2,free(x1, x2) = −iℏRε(x1, x2).
• Free reduced 4-point correlation function:
C4,free,red(x1, x2, x3, x4) = C2,free(x1, x4)C2,free(x2, x3).
This corresponds to the connected Feynman graph pictured in Fig. 7.5(b)
on page 465.49
• Free 2-point vertex function V2,free:

z∈M
V2,free(x, z)C2,free(z, y)∆4z = iℏδ(x, y).
• Free 4-point vertex function:
V4,free(x1, x2, x3, x4) = i
ℏ· V2,free(x1, x4)V2,free(x2, x3).
• Mean ﬁeld transformation (Legendre transformation):
ϕmean,free(x) = i
ℏ

y∈M
C2,free(x, y)J(y)∆4y.
The free mean ﬁeld ϕmean,free coincides with the free ﬁeld caused by the
external source J, that is, (D + iεI)ϕmean,free = −J.
• Inverse mean ﬁeld transformation:
J(x) = −

y∈M
V2,free(x, y)ϕmean,free(y) ∆4y.
Therefore, the inverse kernel to iC2,free(x, y)/ℏis equal to −V2,free(x, y).
• The eﬀective free action V (ϕmean,free) is equal to the free action
Sfree[ϕ] :=

can be shown that the corresponding Feynman graphs are always connected.

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
The formulas above show that the vertex functions are dual to the correlation
functions. If we switch on the interaction such that the coupling constant
κ > 0 is small, then the free functions summarized above are perturbed
slightly. Let us compute this in ﬁrst order with respect to κ, that is, we
neglect terms of order κ2.
Full correlation functions. The free correlation functions Cn,free refer
to vanishing coupling constant, κ = 0. In contrast to this, the full correla-
tion functions Cn describe the behavior of the meson under self-interactions
corresponding to the coupling constant κ > 0. The full n-point correlation
function Cn is deﬁned by
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) :=

cause of the normalization condition Z(0) = 1, the diﬀerence A(J) −A(0)
appears instead of A(J) in (7.156). This cancels the vacuum bubble. Similar
cancellations of vacuum eﬀects appear in higher order of perturbation theory.
The reduced correlation functions. The reduced quantum action
functional Zred is deﬁned by Zred(J) := ln Z(J). Hence
Z(J) = eZred(J).

Proposition 7.45 There exist the following relations between full correla-

(i) Cn,red(x1, . . . , xn) ≡0 if n = 1, 3, 5, . . .

−C2(x1, x3)C2(x2, x4) −C2(x1, x4)C2(x2, x3).
Up to terms of order κ2, the reduced 4-point function is given by the Feynman
diagram from Fig. 7.9. Explicitly,
C4,red(x1, x2, x3, x4) = C2,free(x1, x4)C2,free(x2, x4) + 24κB(x1, x2, x3, x4).
The deﬁnition of B(x1, x2, x3, x4) can be found in Theorem 7.44 on page
468. The Feynman graphs from Fig. 7.9 are precisely the connected graphs
from Fig. 7.5(b) and Fig. 7.7 on pages 465 and 470, respectively.

Vertex functions. The vertex functions are dual objects to the reduced
correlation functions. By the chain rule, there follows from (7.140) and (7.142)
on pages 457 and 459, respectively, that each correlation function can be
represented by vertex functions and 2-point correlation functions. In this
sense, vertex functions and 2-point correlation functions are the building
blocks of general correlation functions (see (7.158) on page 474). In fact,
vertex functions were introduced by physicists in order to simplify lengthy
computations in higher orders of perturbation theory.

nice duality between the reduced correlation function C4,red and the vertex
function V4. In the language of Feynman graphs for correlation functions (see

• the correlation function C2,free corresponding to the external lines
• by the vertex function V2,free, up to an additional factor.
Proof of Proposition 7.46. If κ = 0, then the map J →ϕmean is invert-

δϕmean(x1) · · · δϕmean(xn).
To simplify notation, replace ϕmean by ϕ, and set ℏ:= 1.

Using (7.160), there appears the factor −iδ∆4x(z1, x2) after summing over z2.

The eﬀective action. By deﬁnition, the eﬀective action is given by
Seﬀ[ϕmean] := V (ϕmean).

7.26 The Extended Response Approach
The following modiﬁcation of the response model from Sect. 7.24 is the proto-
type of models used in quantum electrodynamics and in the Standard Model
of particle physics (gauge ﬁeld theory). The basic idea is to replace the action
functional from (7.120) on page 445 by the following action functional
S[ψ, ψ, J, J] := ⟨ψ|(D + iεI)ψ⟩+ κ⟨1|Lint(ψ, ψ)⟩
+⟨J|ψ⟩+ ⟨ψ|J⟩.
(7.161)
In contrast to (7.120), two independent ﬁelds ψ, ψ and two independent source
functions J, J appear. Explicitly, the functional S[ψ, ψ, J, J] is equal to

x,y∈M
ψ(x)D(x, y)ψ(y)∆4x∆4y + κ

x∈M
Lint(ψ(x), ψ(x))∆4x
+

x∈M
{J(x)ψ(x) + ψ(x)J(x) + iεψ(x)ψ(x)}∆4x.
Here, we introduce the coupling constant κ ≥0 and the regularization pa-
rameter ε > 0. With a view to later applications, it is convenient to use the
column matrices
ψ :=
⎛

⎝
ψ(1)

along with the row matrices
ψ := (ψ(1), . . . , ψ(N)),
J := (J(1), . . . , J(N)).
We make the following assumptions:
• ψ(1), . . . , ψ(N), ψ(1), . . . , ψ(N) denote 2N independent real ﬁeld vari-
ables.50
• J(1), . . . J(N), J(1), . . . , J(N) denote 2N independent real source vari-
ables.
• The (N × N)-matrix D is real.
• There is a number ε0 > 0 such that the inverse matrix (D + iεI)−1 exists
for all ε ∈]0, ε0[.
• The function Lint : R2 →R is a real polynomial of the two real variables ζ
and ζ. For example, Lint(ζ, ζ) := (ζζ)2.
The proofs of the following statements proceed as in Sect. 7.24 on page 438.
The principle of critical action. We are given the source functions
J, J ∈L2(M).
Theorem 7.47 Each solution ψ, ψ ∈L2(M) of the variational problem
S[ψ, ψ, J, J] = critical!
(7.162)
satisﬁes the following Euler-Lagrange equations
δS
δψ(x) = 0,
δS
δψ(x) = 0
for all
x ∈M.
(7.163)
Explicitly, the Euler–Lagrange equations read as
(Dψ)(x) + iεψ(x) + κ∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x)) + J(x) = 0
and
(ψD)(x) + iεψ(x) + κ∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x)) + J(x) = 0.
Proof. (I) For ﬁxed h ∈L2(M), set
χ(τ) := S[ψ, ψ + τh, J, J],
τ ∈R.
From the variational problem (7.162), we get χ′(0) = 0. This yields
⟨h|(D + iεI)ψ⟩+ ⟨h|J⟩+ κ

x∈M
∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x))h(x) = 0.
50 The case of complex variables will be considered in Sect. 7.27 on page 483.

This can be written as

x∈M
δS
δψ(x)h(x) = 0
for all
h ∈L2(M)
(7.164)
along with
δS
δψ(x) = {(D + iεI)ψ}(x) + J(x) + κ∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x)).
From equation (7.164) we obtain
δS
δψ(x) = 0.
(II) Similarly, for ﬁxed h ∈L2(M), set
χ(τ) := S[ψ + τh, ψ, J, J],
τ ∈R.
From χ′(0) = 0 we get
⟨ψ|(D + iεI)h⟩+ ⟨J|h⟩+ κ

x∈M
∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x))h(x) = 0.
This implies

x∈M
δS
δψ(x)h(x) = 0
for all
h ∈L2(M)
along with
δS
δψ(x) = {ψ(D + iεI)}(x) + J(x) + κ∂Lint
∂ζ (ψ(x), ψ(x)).
Hence
δS
δψ(x) = 0.

The response function. The inverse operator Rε := −(D + iεI)−1 is
called response operator. Switching oﬀthe interaction by setting κ = 0, the
so-called response equations
(D + iεI)ψ = −J,
ψ(D + iεI) = −J
have the unique solution ψ = RεJ and ψ = JRε, respectively. Explicitly,
ψ(x) =

y∈M
Rε(x, y)J(y)∆4y,
ψ(y) =

The kernel (x, y) →Rε(x, y) is called response function. Equation (7.165)
tells us how the source function J inﬂuences the free ﬁeld ψ, and how the
second source function J inﬂuences the free ﬁeld ψ.

Z(0, 0) = 1. The local functional derivatives of the quantum action func-

The mean ﬁeld approximation. The reduced quantum action func-
tional is deﬁned by

Vertex functions and eﬀective action. Let us deﬁne the vertex func-

The map

is called Legendre transformation. Let us write ψ and ψ instead of ψmean and
ψmean, respectively. For n, m = 1, 2, . . ., the functions

is called the eﬀective action of the mean ﬁeld.

particular, the action functional reads as

Recall that ψ(x)† denotes the complex-conjugate of ψ(x). We are given the

• ψ(1), . . . , ψ(N) are complex ﬁeld variables.
• J(1), . . . J(N) denote complex source variables.
• The complex (N × N)-matrix D is self-adjoint.
• There is a number ε0 > 0 such that the inverse matrix (D + iεI)−1 exists
for all ε ∈]0, ε0[.
• The function Lint : C2 →R is a complex polynomial of the two variables
ζ and ζ†. For example, Lint(ζ, ζ†) := (ζ†ζ)2.
The special case where Lint := −(ψψ†)2 = −|ψ|4 is called the discrete com-

lemma. We are given f, g ∈L2(M). Suppose that
⟨h†|f⟩+ ⟨g|h⟩= 0
for all
h ∈L2(M).
(7.171)
Then f ≡0 and g ≡0. In fact, equation (7.171) reads explicitly as

x∈M
(h(x)†f(x) + g(x)h(x))∆4x = 0.
First use real values h(x). Then, f(x)+g(x) = 0 for all x ∈M. Secondly, use
purely imaginary values h(x). Then, −f(x) + g(x) = 0 for all x ∈M. Hence
f(x) = g(x) = 0 for all x ∈M.
(II) For ﬁxed h ∈L2(M), set
χ(τ) := S[ψ + τh, ψ† + τh†, J, J†],

Parallel to the (ψ, ψ)-model, it is also possible to obtain the quantum ac-

principle based on a ﬁnite functional integral.
7.28 The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
Reduce constrained extremal problems to free extremal problems by chang-
ing the Lagrangian.
Folklore
The Standard Model of particle physics is based on gauge ﬁeld theory. The
ﬁxing of a gauge corresponds to some constraint. Therefore, constrained vari-
ational problems will play a fundamental role in the Standard Model later on.
At this point, let us only summarize the basic ideas of the rigorous theory for
ﬁnite-dimensional constrained problems. The point is that the Lagrange mul-
tiplier rule only applies to regular solutions of constrained problems. From
the physical point of view, Lagrange multipliers correspond to
• constraining forces in classical mechanics,
• ghosts and antighosts (BRST symmetry) in non-commutative gauge ﬁeld
theories (e.g., electroweak and strong interaction in the Standard Model).51
51 In the author’s monograph, Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, the interested reader may ﬁnd
the general functional analytic theory of Lagrange multipliers along with many
applications to extremal problems in the calculus of variations, linear and non-
linear optimization (e.g., the Kuhn–Tucker theory for convex problems) and op-
timal control (e.g., the Pontryagin maximum principle applied to optimal moon
landing and the optimal return of a spaceship to earth).

Simple constrained problem. Consider the minimum problem

(7.174)
Obviously, the solution is x0 = 0, y0 = −1. The problem
y = critical!
(7.175)
under the constraint (7.174) means the following. Set F(x, y) := y. Consider
a smooth curve x = x(τ), y = y(τ) which satisﬁes the constraint (7.174) along
with x(0) = x0, y(0) = y0. Set
χ(τ) := F(x(τ), y(τ)),
τ ∈R.
By deﬁnition, the point (x0, y0) is a solution of problem (7.175) along with
the constraint (7.174) iﬀχ′(0) = 0. Explicitly, the solutions are x0 = 0 and
y0 = ±1 which correspond to a minimum and a maximum, respectively.

of (7.176), (7.177) is called regular iﬀfor each real number c, the linearized
constraint
Gx(x0, y0)a + Gy(x0, y0)b = c
has a solution (a, b) ∈R2. In other words,
(Gx(x0, y0), Gy(x0, y0)) ̸= (0, 0).
This means that the rank of this matrix is maximal (i.e., equal to 1).52 It
was the idea of Lagrange to replace the original constrained problem (7.176),
(7.177) by the free problem
F(x, y) + λG(x, y) = critical!
(7.178)
where λ is a ﬁxed, but unknown real parameter. This parameter is called
Lagrange multiplier.
52 In terms of geometry, we postulate that the constraint G(x, y) = 0, (x, y) ∈R2
represents a manifold (i.e., a curve which has a tangent line at each point).

7.28 The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
489
Proposition 7.51 If (x0, y0) is a regular solution of the constrained problem
(7.176), (7.177), then there exists a real number λ such that (x0, y0) is a
solution of the free problem (7.178), that is,
Fx(x0, y0) + λGx(x0, y0) = 0,
Fy(x0, y0) + λGy(x0, y0) = 0. (7.179)
As a rule, this equation along with the constraint G(x0, y0) = 0 determines
uniquely the Lagrange multiplier λ. In classical mechanics, the value of λ
describes the strength of the constraining force (see the spherical pendulum
below). The proof of the classical Proposition 7.51 can be found in Zeidler
(1986), Vol. III, Sect. 43.10.
In the case of problem (7.173), (7.174), we have F(x, y) := y and
G(x, y) := x2 + y2 −1.
The constraint G(x, y) = 0 describes the unit circle. Obviously, this is a
manifold. Equation (7.179) yields
2λx0 = 0,
1 + 2λy0 = 0.
Hence λ ̸= 0. This implies x0 = 0. From x2 + y2 = 1 we get y0 = ±1. Finally,
λ = ∓1/2.
The principle of critical action under constraints. Consider the
variational problem
S[ϕ] = critical!
(7.180)
under the constraints
Gk[ϕ] = 0,
k = 1, . . . , K.
(7.181)
Suppose that S, G1, . . . , GK : RN →R are smooth functions where K < N.
Let us also consider the system of linearized constraints:53

δϕ(x)
hk(x) = ck,
k = 1, . . . , K.
(7.182)
A solution ϕ0 of (7.180), (7.181) is called regular iﬀfor arbitrary real numbers
c1, . . . , cK, equation (7.182) has always a real solution h1, . . . hk.
Theorem 7.52 Let ϕ0 be a regular solution of the constrained problem
(7.180), (7.181). Then, there exist real numbers λk indexed by k = 1, . . . , K
such that

ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(N).

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
The proof of this ﬁnite-dimensional theorem along with inﬁnite-dimensional
generalizations and numerous applications can be found in Zeidler (1986),
Vol. III, Sect. 43.10.
The universal Gaussian principle of critical constraint. We want
to study the motion x = x(t) of a classical particle of mass m > 0 under the
constraints
f(x(t), t) = 0,
g(x(t), ˙x(t), t) = 0.
(7.183)
From this, we get the linearized constraints54
fx(X)¨x + ˙xfxx(X) ˙x + 2fxt(X) ˙x + ftt(X) = 0,
g ˙x(X)¨x + gx(X) ˙x + gt(X) = 0
(7.184)
where X := (x, ˙x, t). We assume that the functions f : R3 × R →R and
g : R3 × R3 × R →R are smooth, and the regularity condition
fx(X)2g ˙x(X)2 −fx(X)g ˙x(X) ̸= 0
(7.185)
is satisﬁed for all points X with f(X) = g(X) = 0. According to Gauss, the
equation of motion for the particle reads as
m¨x = F + λfx + µg ˙x.
(7.186)
The additional force Fc := λfx + µg ˙x is called constraining force. Explicitly,
m¨x = F(X) + λ(X)fx(X) + µ(X)g ˙x(X).
Here, λ(X) and µ(X) are uniquely determined by the linearized constraint
(7.184). In fact, it follows from (7.184) and (7.186) that
λf 2
x + µg ˙xfx = −Ffx −˙xfxx ˙x −2fxt ˙x −ftt,
λg ˙xfx + µg2
˙x = −Fg ˙x −gx ˙x −gt
at the point X := (x, ˙x, t). By the regularity condition (7.185), this linear
system has a unique solution (λ, µ). Let us now show that the equation of
motion follows from the Gaussian principle of critical constraint:
54 Equation (7.184) is obtained from (7.183) by diﬀerentiating with respect to time
t. In fact, it follows from f(x(t), t) = 0 that
fx(x(t), t) ˙x(t) + ft(x(t), t) = 0.
Again diﬀerentiating this with respect to t, we obtain
fx(x(t), t)¨x(t) + ˙x(t)fxx(x(t), t) ˙x(t) + 2fxt(x(t), t) ˙x(t) + ftt(x(t), t) = 0.

= critical!,
(7.187)
fx(X)¨x + ˙xfxx(X) ˙x + 2fxt(X) ˙x + ftt(X) = 0,
g ˙x(X)¨x + gx(X) ˙x + gt(X) = 0.
This represents a variant of the Gaussian least square method. We are looking
for a solution ¨x which depends on the ﬁxed parameter X := (x, ˙x, t). A
solution of (7.187) is called regular iﬀcondition (7.185) is satisﬁed.
Theorem 7.53 Every regular solution of the Gaussian principle of critical
constraint (7.187) satisﬁes the equation of motion (7.186).
Proof. (I) Regularity. By (7.185), the rank of the matrix
(fx(X), g ˙x(X))
is maximal (i.e., equal to 2). To show this suppose that λfx(X)+µg ˙x(X) = 0.
Hence
λfx(X)2 + µfx(X)g ˙x(X) = 0,
λg ˙x(X)fx(X) + µg ˙x(X)2 = 0.
By (7.185), λ = µ = 0.
(II) We are now able to use the general Lagrange multiplier rule on RN
whose proof can be found in Zeidler (1986), Sect. 43.10. By this rule, the
original constrained problem (7.187) is equivalent to the free problem

Diﬀerentiating this with respect to ¨x, we get the equation of motion (7.186).

Special case. Suppose that g ≡0. In this case, we have to replace the
regularity condition (7.185) by fx(x, t) ̸= 0 for all (x, t) with f(x, t) = 0. The
equation of motion reads now as
m¨x = F(x, ˙x, t) + λ(x, ˙x, t)fx(x, t).
The parameter λ follows uniquely from
fx(X)2λ = −F(X)fx(X) −˙xfxx(X) ˙x −2fxt(X) ˙x −ftt(X).
Application to the spherical pendulum. Let us investigate the mo-
tion of a point of mass m > 0 on a sphere of radius R under the action of
the gravitational force of earth. This corresponds to the constraint

7. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Magic Formulas
x2 −R2 = 0
and the force F := −mgk. Here, we use the outer normal unit vector k of
earth and the acceleration constant g = 9.81m/s2. Setting f(x) := 1
2(x2−R2),
we get the equation of motion
m¨x = −mgk + Fc.
The constraining force is given by Fc := λfx(x) = λx (normal force) along
with
f 2
xλ = mg · kfx −˙xfxx ˙x = mg · kx −˙x2.
Hence
λ = mg · kx −˙x2
R2
.
Here, z = kx is the height of the point x. For example, if the mass point
rests at the South Pole of the sphere, then ¨x = 0. As expected, this implies
Fc = −Fgravitation = mgk.
The Gaussian principle of critical constraint is the most general principle
for the motion of n particles under constraints in classical mechanics. The
general formulation of this principle can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV,
Sect. 58.10.
7.29 The Formal Continuum Limit
The passage from the discrete ϕ4-model to the corresponding continuum
model is based on the formal limit
N →+∞,
∆x →+0
(7.188)
Explicitly, this means the following:
• Space-time manifold: M →M4.
• Integral:

M4 f(x)d4x.
• Dirac’s delta function: δ∆4x(x, y) →δ4(x −y).

The point is that, as a rule, the formal limits above produce divergent expres-
sions. The idea of the method of counterterms is to change the Lagrangian
of the theory in such a way that
(i) new terms appear which regularize the divergent integrals, and
(ii) the original physical parameters are replaced by new ﬁnite parameters
which have to be determined by the physical experiment.
This is the procedure of renormalization to be discussed in Sect. 15.4. The
counterterms for the continuum ϕ4-model can be found in Sect. 15.4.2.

Solution: Ad (i). Argue as in the proof of Theorem 7.49.

(D + iεI)ψ = −J along with D† = D that
ψ†(D −iεI) = −J†.
By (7.196), 2iεψ† = 0. Hence ψ = 0. Again by (7.196), we get J = 0, a

Theory
Perturbation theory is the most important method in modern physics.
Folklore
8.1 Renormalization
In quantum ﬁeld theory, a crucial role is played by renormalization. Let us now
study this phenomenon in a very simpliﬁed manner.
• We want to show how mathematical diﬃculties arise if nonlinear equations are
linearized in the incorrect place.
• Furthermore, we will discuss how to overcome these diﬃculties by using the
methods of bifurcation theory.
The main trick is to replace the original problem by an equivalent one by introducing
so-called regularizing terms. We have to distinguish between
• the non-resonance case (N) (or regular case), and
• the resonance case (R) (or singular case).
In celestial mechanics, it is well-known that resonance may cause highly complicated
motions of asteroids.1
In rough terms, the complexity of phenomena in quantum ﬁeld theory is
caused by resonances.
In Sect. 7.16, the non-resonance case and the resonance case were studied for linear
operator equations. We now want to generalize this to nonlinear problems.
8.1.1 Non-Resonance
Consider the nonlinear operator equation
H0ϕ + κ(v0 + V (ϕ)) = Eϕ,
ϕ ∈X.
(8.1)
We make the following assumptions.
(A1) The complex Hilbert space X has the ﬁnite dimension N = 1, 2, . . .
1 This is described mathematically by KAM theory (Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser
theory). As an introduction, we recommend Scheck (2000), Vol. 1, and Thirring
(1997).

(A2) The operator H0 : X →X is linear and self-adjoint. Furthermore,
H0|E0
j ⟩= E0
j |E0
j ⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.
Here, the energy eigenstates |E0
1⟩, . . . , |E0
N⟩form a complete orthonormal sys-
tem of X.
(A3) We set V (ϕ) := W (ϕ, ϕ, ϕ) for all ϕ ∈X, where the given operator W :
X × X × X →X is linear in each argument. For example, we may choose
V (ϕ) := ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩ϕ.
(A4) We are given the complex constant κ called the coupling constant, and we
are given the ﬁxed element v0 of the space X.
We are looking for an element ϕ of X.
Theorem 8.1 Suppose that we are given the complex number E diﬀerent from the
energy values E0
1, . . . , E0
N. Then, there exist positive numbers κ0 and r0 such that,
for each given coupling constant κ with |κ| ≤κ0, equation (8.1) has precisely one
solution ϕ ∈X with ||ϕ|| ≤r0.
Proof. Equation (8.1) is equivalent to
ϕ = −κ(H0 −EI)−1(v0 + V (ϕ)),
ϕ ∈X.
The statement follows now from the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem in Sect. 7.13.
2
In particular, the solution ϕ can be computed by using the following iterative
method
ϕn+1 = −κ(H0 −EI)−1(v0 + V (ϕn)),
n = 0, 1, . . .
(8.2)
with ϕ0 := 0. This method converges to ϕ as n →∞in the Hilbert space X. For
the ﬁrst approximation, we get

(8.3)
Let us discuss this.
(N) The non-resonance case (regular case). The expression (8.3) makes sense, since
we assume that the parameter E is diﬀerent from the eigenvalues E0
1, . . . , E0
N.
We say that the value E is not in resonance with the eigenvalues E0
1, . . . , E0
N.
Then, the Green’s operator (H0 −EI)−1 is well-deﬁned. Explicitly,
(H0 −EI)−1 =

(R) The resonance case (singular case). The situation changes completely if we
choose
E := E0
1.
Here, we say that the value E is in resonance with the eigenvalue E0
1. Then,
the Green’s operator (H0 −E0
1I)−1 does not exist, and the iterative method
(8.2) above fails completely. As a rule, ϕ1 is an inﬁnite quantity. Furthermore,
if we set
E := E0
1 + ε,
ε ̸= 0,

ε = −∞,
some of the expressions arising from perturbation theory become very large if
the perturbation ε is very small.
Summarizing, it turns out that
Naive perturbation theory fails completely in the resonance case.
This situation is typical for the naive use of perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld
theory. In what follows, we will show how to obtain a rigorous result. To this
end, we will replace the naive iterative method (8.2) above by the rigorous, more
sophisticated iterative method (8.12) below.
8.1.2 Resonance, Regularizing Term, and Bifurcation
Set E := E0
1 + ε. Consider the nonlinear operator equation
H0ϕ + κV (ϕ) = Eϕ,
ϕ ∈X.
(8.4)
In addition to (A1) through (A4) above, we assume that the energy eigenvalue
E0
1 is simple, that is, the eigenvectors to E0
1 have the form ϱ|E0
1⟩where ϱ is an
arbitrary nonzero complex number. We are looking for a solution (ϕ, E) of (8.4)
with ϕ ∈X and E ∈C. The proof of the following theorem will be based on the
use of regularizing terms.
Theorem 8.2 There exist positive constants κ0, s0, η0 and r0 such that for given
complex parameters κ and s with
|κ| ≤κ0,
0 < |s| ≤s0,
equation (8.4) has precisely one solution ϕ, E which satisﬁes the normalization con-
dition
⟨E0
1|ϕ⟩= s
and the smallness conditions |E −E0
1| ≤η0 and ||ϕ|| ≤r0.
Before proving this, let us discuss the physical meaning of this result. We will
show below that the zeroth approximation of the solution looks like
ϕ = s|E0
1⟩,
E = E0
1.
The ﬁrst approximation of the energy is given by
E = E0
1 + κs2⟨GregV (ψ1)|ψ1⟩
where we set ψ1 := |E0
1⟩. Observe the following point which is crucial for under-
standing the phenomenon of renormalization in physics.
From the mathematical point of view, we obtain a branch of solutions which
depends on the parameter s.
The free parameter s has to be determined by physical experiments.

8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
Let us discuss this. Suppose that we measure the
• energy E and
• the running coupling constant κ.
We then obtain the approximation
κ =
E −E0
1
s2⟨GregV (ψ1)|ψ1⟩.
This tells us the value of the parameter s. This phenomenon is typical for renormal-
ization in quantum ﬁeld theory. The energy E0
1 is called the bare energy. However,
this bare energy is not a relevant physical quantity. In a physical experiment we
do not measure the bare energy E0
1, but the energy E and the running coupling
constant κ. In elementary particle physics, this corresponds to the fact that the rest
energy of an elementary particle (e.g., an electron) results from complex interac-
tion processes. Therefore, the rest energy E diﬀers from the bare energy E0
1. In the
present simple example, interactions are modelled by the nonlinear term κV (ϕ).
Proof of Theorem 8.2. (I) The resonance condition. To simplify notation, set
ψj := |E0
j ⟩, j = 1, . . . , N. For given χ ∈X, consider the linear operator equation
H0ϕ −E0
1ϕ = χ,
ϕ ∈X.

P : X →span(ψ1) projects the Hilbert space X orthogonally onto the 1-dimensional
eigenvector space to the energy eigenvalue E0
1. We now consider the modiﬁed equa-
tion
H0ϕ + Pϕ −E0
1ϕ = χ,
ϕ ∈X.
(8.7)
Theorem 7.16 on page 377 tells us that, for each given χ ∈X, equation (8.7) has
the unique solution
ϕ = (H0 + P −E0

We deﬁne Greg := (H0 + P −E0
1I)−1. Explicitly,2
ϕ = Gregχ = ⟨ψ1|χ⟩ψ1 +

In particular, Gregψ1 = ψ1. The term Pϕ = ⟨ψ1|ϕ⟩ψ1 in (8.7) is called regularizing
term.
(III) The trick of regularizing term. The original equation (8.4) on page 499 can
be written equivalently as
2 In fact, (H0 + P −E0
1I)ϕ is equal to ⟨ψ1|χ⟩ψ1 + PN
j=2⟨ψj|χ⟩ψj = χ.

8.1 Renormalization
501
H0ϕ −E0
1ϕ + κV (ϕ) + ⟨ψ1|ϕ⟩ψ1 = sψ1 + εϕ,
ϕ ∈X
(8.8)
along with the normalization condition
⟨ψ1|ϕ⟩= s.
(8.9)
By (II), this is equivalent to the operator equation
ϕ = Greg(sψ1 −κV (ϕ) + εϕ)
along with (8.9). Finally, since Gregψ1 = ψ1, we obtain the equivalent operator
equation
ϕ = sψ1 −κGregV (ϕ) + εGregϕ
(8.10)
along with (8.9). We have to solve the system (8.9), (8.10). To this end, we will use
both a rescaling and the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem.
(IV) Rescaling. Set ϕ := s(1 + ε)ψ1 + sχ. Equation (8.9) yields
s⟨ψ1|ψ1 + εψ1 + χ⟩= s.
Since s ̸= 0 and ⟨ψ1|ψ1⟩= 1, we get ε = −⟨ψ1|χ⟩. Furthermore, it follows from
(8.10) that
s(1 + ε)ψ1 + sχ = sψ1 −κs3GregV ((1 + ε)ψ1 + χ)
+sε(1 + ε)ψ1 + sεGregχ.
Consequently, the system (8.9), (8.10) corresponds to the following equivalent sys-
tem
χ = A(χ, ε, κ, s),
ε = −⟨ψ1|A(χ, ε, κ, s)⟩,
χ ∈X, ε ∈C
(8.11)
along with
A(χ, ε, κ, s) := −κs2GregV ((1 + ε)ψ1 + χ) + εGregχ + ε2ψ1.
(V) The Banach ﬁxed-point theorem. The system (8.11) represents an operator
equation on the Banach space X × C with the norm
||(χ, ε)|| := ||χ|| + |ε|.
We are given the complex parameters s and κ with 0 < |s| ≤s0 and |κ| ≤κ0
where s0 > 0 and κ0 > 0 are suﬃciently small numbers. By the Banach ﬁxed-point
theorem in Sect. 7.13 on page 366, there exists a small closed ball B about the origin
in the Banach space X × C such that the operator equation (8.11) has a unique
solution in the closed ball B.
(V) Iterative method. By the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem, the solution (χ, ε) of
(8.11) can be computed by using the following iterative method
χn+1 = A(χn, εn, κ, s),
εn+1 = −⟨ψ1|A(χn, εn, κ, s)⟩,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(8.12)
with χ0 := 0 and ε0 := 0. This method converges in the Banach space X × C. In
particular, we get
χ1 = −κs2GregV (ψ1),
ε1 = κs2⟨ψ1|GregV (ψ1)⟩.

Bifurcation. On the product space X ×C, the original nonlinear problem (8.4)
on page 499 has two diﬀerent solution curves, namely,

502
8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
• the trivial solution curve ϕ = 0, E = arbitrary complex number,
• and the nontrivial solution curve (ϕ = ϕ(s, κ), E = E(s, κ)) given by Theorem
8.2 on page 499.
The two curves intersect each other at the point ϕ = 0, E = E0
1. Therefore, we
speak of bifurcation. The nontrivial solution branch of equation (8.4) represents a
perturbation of the curve
ϕ = sψ1,
E = E0
1,
s ∈C
which corresponds to the linearized problem H0ϕ = E0
1ϕ. Bifurcation theory is part
of nonlinear functional analysis. A detailed study of the methods of bifurcation
theory along with many applications in mathematical physics and mathematical
biology can be found in Zeidler (1986).
8.1.3 The Renormalization Group
The method of renormalization group plays a crucial role in modern physics.
Roughly speaking, this method studies the behavior of physical eﬀects under
the rescaling of typical parameters.
We are going to study a very simpliﬁed model for this. Let (ϕ(s, κ), E(s, κ)) be the
solution of the original equation (8.4) on page 499, that is,
H0ϕ(s, κ) + κV [ϕ(s, κ)] = E(s, κ)ϕ(s, κ)
along with ⟨ψ1|ϕ(s, κ)⟩= s. Choose the ﬁxed real number λ > 0. Replacing s →λs
and κ →

ψ(s, κ) := 1
λ · ϕ
“

.
Noting that V (λψ) = λ3V (ψ), we obtain
H0ψ(s, κ) + κV [ψ(s, κ)] = E
“
λs, κ

”
ψ(s, κ)
along with ⟨ψ1|ψ(s, κ)⟩= s. By the uniqueness statement from Theorem 8.2 on
page 499, we get

“

(8.13)
along with
E
“

(8.14)
for all nonzero complex parameters s and κ in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of
the origin.

8.1 Renormalization
503
Summarizing, the homogeneity of the potential, V (λϕ) = λ3V (ϕ), implies
the symmetries (8.13), (8.14) of the solution branch.
Diﬀerentiating equation (8.13) with respect to the parameter λ, and setting λ = 1,
we obtain
ϕ(s, κ) −sϕs(s, κ) + 2κϕκ(s, κ) = 0.
(8.15)
In our model, the diﬀerential equation (8.15) can be regarded as a simpliﬁed version
of the Callan–Szymanzik equation in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Let R×
+ denote the set of all positive real numbers; that is, x ∈R×
+ iﬀx > 0.
For each parameter λ ∈R×
+, deﬁne the map Tλ : C2 →C2 given by
Tλ(s, κ) :=
“
λs, κ
λ2
”
.
For all parameters λ, µ ∈R×
+,
Tλµ = TλTµ.
Therefore, the family {Tλ}λ∈R×
+ of all operators Tλ forms a group. This group is
called the renormalization group of the original operator equation (8.4) on page
499.
8.1.4 The Main Bifurcation Theorem
Let us now study the general case of the nonlinear equation
H0ϕ + κV (ϕ) = Eϕ,
ϕ ∈X
(8.16)
where the eigenvalue E0
1 of the linearized problem
H0ϕ = E0
1ϕ
is not simple as in Sect. 8.1.2, but it has general multiplicity. To this end, we will
reduce the problem to the nonlinear system (8.17) below. We make the following
assumptions.
(A1) The complex Hilbert space X has the ﬁnite dimension N = 1, 2, . . .
(A2) Linear operator: The operator H0 : X →X is linear and self-adjoint. Fur-
thermore,
H0|E0
j ⟩= E0
j |E0
j ⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.
Here, the energy eigenstates |E0
1⟩, . . . , |E0
N⟩form a complete orthonormal sys-
tem of X.
(A3) Multiplicity: The eigenvalue E0
1 has the multiplicity m, that is, the eigenvec-
tors |E0
1⟩, . . . , |E0
m⟩form a basis of the eigenspace of H0 to the eigenvalue E0
1.
Let 1 ≤m < N. To simplify notation, set ψj := |E0
j ⟩. Deﬁne the orthogonal
projection operator P : X →X by setting
Pϕ :=
m
X
j=1
⟨ψj|ϕ⟩ψj
for all
ϕ ∈X.
(A4) Nonlinearity: We set V (ϕ) := W (ϕ, ϕ, ϕ) for all ϕ ∈X, where the given
operator W : X × X × X →X is linear in each argument. For example,
V (ϕ) := ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩ϕ.

504
8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
(A5) Resonance condition: The nonlinear equation3
σ = κPV (σ),
σ ∈PX, κ ∈C
(8.17)
has a solution (σ0, κ0) where σ0 ̸= 0 and κ0 ̸= 0. This solution is regular, that
is, the linearized equation
h = κ0P · V ′(σ0)h,
h ∈X
(8.18)
has only the trivial solution h = 0.
Theorem 8.3 There exists a number α0 > 0 such that for each given complex
number α with |α| ≤α0, the nonlinear problem (8.16) with the coupling constant
κ0 has a solution
ϕ = ασ0 + O(α2),
E = E0
1 + α2,
α →0.
Proof. (I) The regularized Green’s operator. For all χ ∈X, deﬁne

Suppose that we are given χ ∈X with Pχ = 0. By Theorem 7.16 on page 377, the
equation
H0ϱ −E0
1ϱ = χ
has precisely one solution ϱ ∈X with Pϱ = 0. This solution is given by
ϱ = Gregχ =

(II) Equivalent system. Set E := E0
1+ε, and introduce the orthogonal projection
operator Q := I −P. Explicitly,
Qϕ =
N
X
j=m+1
⟨ψj|ϕ⟩ψj
for all
ϕ ∈X.
Then, the original nonlinear problem (8.16) is equivalent to
Q(H0ϕ −(E0
1 + ε)ϕ + κV (ϕ)) = 0,
P(H0ϕ −(E0
1 + ε)ϕ + κV (ϕ)) = 0.
(8.19)
The idea of the following proof is
3 Set σ := s1ψ1 + . . . + smψm. Equation (8.17) is then equivalent to the system
gj(s1, . . . , sm; κ) = 0
j = 1, . . . , m,
s1, . . . , sm ∈C.
Here, gj(s1, . . . , sm; κ) := sj −κ · ⟨ψj|V (s1ψ1 + . . . + smψm)⟩. Condition (8.18)
means that

(i) to solve the ﬁrst equation from (8.19) by the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem,
(ii) to insert the solution from (i) into the second equation from (8.19), and
(iii) to solve the resulting equation by using the implicit function theorem near the
solution (σ0, κ0) of equation (8.17).
For each ϕ ∈X, deﬁne χ := Pϕ and ϱ := Qϕ. Then
ϕ = χ + ϱ,
χ ∈PX, ϱ ∈QX.
Therefore, system (8.19) is equivalent to
Q{H0(χ + ϱ) −(E0
1 + ε)(χ + ϱ) + κV (χ + ϱ)} = 0,
P{H0(χ + ϱ) −(E0
1 + ε)(χ + ϱ) + κV (χ + ϱ)} = 0.
(8.20)
Observe that ⟨ψj|H0ϕ −E0
1ϕ⟩= ⟨H0ψj −E0
1ψj|ϕ⟩= 0 for j = 1, . . . , m. Hence
P(H0 −E0
1I) = 0.
Furthermore, Pχ = χ, Qχ = 0 and Qϱ = ϱ, Pϱ = 0. Thus, choosing the coupling
constant κ := κ0 and recalling that Q := I −P, the system (8.20) is equivalent to
H0ϱ −E0
1ϱ = εϱ −κ0QV (χ + ϱ),
εχ = κ0PV (χ + ϱ).
(8.21)
Finally, using the regularized Green’s operator, this system is equivalent to the
equation
ϱ = εGregϱ −κ0GregQV (χ + ϱ)
(8.22)
along with
εχ = κ0PV (χ + ϱ).
(8.23)
(III) Rescaling. We set χ := ασ and ε := α2. Equation (8.22) passes then over
to
ϱ = α2Gregϱ −κ0GregQV (ασ + ϱ).
(8.24)
(IV) The Banach ﬁxed-point theorem. By Theorem 7.12 on page 367, there
exist positive parameters α0, β0 and r0 such that for given α ∈C and σ ∈PX with
|α| ≤α0,
||σ|| ≤β0,
equation (8.24) has precisely one solution ϱ ∈QX with ||ϱ|| ≤r0. This solution
will be denoted by
ϱ = ϱ(α, σ).
By the analytic form of the implicit function theorem,4 the components of ϱ(α, σ)
depend holomorphically on the complex parameter α. The iterative method
ϱn+1 = α2Gregϱn −κ0GregQV (ασ + ϱn),
n = 0, 1, . . .
with ϱ0 := 0 (or comparison of coeﬃcients) shows that
4 This can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, Sect. 8.3.

8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
ϱ(α, σ) = −α3κ0GregQV (σ) + O(α4),
α →0.
(V) The bifurcation equation. Inserting ϱ(α, σ) into equation (8.23), we get
α3σ = κ0PV (ασ + ϱ(α, σ)).
Dividing this by α3, we obtain the so-called bifurcation equation
σ = κ0PV (σ) + O(α),
α →0.
(8.25)
For α = 0, this equation has the solution σ = σ0, by assumption (A5). Choose
h ∈X. Diﬀerentiating the equation
σ0 + th = κ0PV (σ0 + th)
with respect to the real parameter t at t = 0, we get
h = κ0P · V ′(σ0)h.
(8.26)
This is the linearization of (8.25) at the point σ = σ0, α = 0. By assumption (A5),
equation (8.26) has only the trivial solution h = 0. By the implicit function theorem,
the bifurcation equation (8.25) has a solution of the form
σ = σ0 + O(α),
α →0.
2
Modiﬁcation. If the resonance condition (A5) above is satisﬁed for the modi-
ﬁed equation
σ = −κPV (σ),
σ ∈PX, κ ∈C,
then Theorem 8.3 remains true if we replace E = E0
1 + α2 by E = E0
1 −α2.
8.2 The Rellich Theorem
Let X be a complex Hilbert space of ﬁnite dimension N = 1, 2, . . . . Consider the
eigenvalue equation
Aϕ = λϕ,
λ ∈R, ϕ ∈X \ {0}
along with the perturbed problem
A(ε)ϕ(ε) = λ(ε)ϕ(ε),
λ(ε) ∈R, ϕ(ε) ∈X \ {0}
where ε is a small real perturbation parameter, and A(0) = A. We assume the
following.
(H1) The linear operator A : X →X is self-adjoint.
(H2) There exists an open neighborhood U(0) of the origin of the real line such
that for each ε ∈U(0), the operator A(ε) : X →X is linear and self-adjoint,
and it depends holomorphically on the parameter ε. Explicitly,
A(ε) = A + εA1 + ε2A2 + . . .
This means that for each arbitrary, but ﬁxed basis |1⟩, . . . , |N⟩of the space X,
all of the matrix elements ⟨m|A(ε)|n⟩are power series expansions which are
convergent for all real parameters ε ∈U(0).

8.3 The Trotter Product Formula
507
By the principal axis theorem, each operator A(ε) with ε ∈U(0) possesses a com-
plete orthonormal system of eigenvectors with real eigenvalues.
Theorem 8.4 There exists a small neighborhood of the origin V (0) of the real line
such that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A(ε) depend holomorphi-
cally on the real parameter ε ∈V (0).
Explicitly, this means the following. Let ϕ be an eigenvector of multiplicity m
of the operator A with eigenvalue λ ∈R. Then, there exist power series expansions
λj(ε) = λ + ελj1 + ε2λj2 + . . . ,
ϕj(ε) = ϕ + εϕj1 + ε2ϕj2 + . . . ,
j = 1, 2, . . . , m
which converge for all ε ∈V (0), and which are eigensolutions of A(ε).5 In addition,
there exists a number δ > 0 such that λ1(ε), . . . , λm(ε) are the only eigenvalues of
A(ε) which lie in the interval ]λ −δ, λ + δ[.
Theorem 8.4 is the special case of a general theorem due to Rellich which is
valid for a broad class of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces. The proof can be
found in Riesz and Nagy (1978), Sect. 136.
8.3 The Trotter Product Formula
Theorem 8.5 Let A, B : X →X be linear operators on the ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space X. Then
eA+B = lim
N→∞(eA/NeB/N)N.
Proof. Set C := e(A+B)/N and D := eA/NeB/N. Then

since the terms for m = 1 cancel each other. Using

8.4 The Magic Baker–Campbell–HausdorﬀFormula
Let A, B : X →X be linear operators on the complex ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
space X with AB = BA. Then
eAeB = eA+B.
However, the commutation relation AB = BA is frequently violated in mathematics
and physics. We then have to use the following Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀformula
eAeB = eA+B+ 1
2 [A,B]−+r(A,B)
(8.27)
if the operator norms ||A|| and ||B|| are suﬃciently small. Again, we see the Lie
product [A, B]−:= AB −BA. The remainder r(A, B) has the form
r(A, B) =
∞
X
k=3
pk(A, B)
(8.28)
where pk(A, B) is a polynomial of order k of the variables A, B with respect to the
Lie product [., .]−. The coeﬃcients of pk(A, B) are rational numbers. For example,
12p3(A, B) = A · (A · B) + B · (B · A),
24p4(A, B) = B · (A · (B · A))
where we write A · B instead of [A, B]−. The point is that the exponent
A + B + 1
2[A, B]−+ r(A, B)
lies in the Lie algebra generated by the operators A and B. Thus, the generalized
addition theorem (8.27) for the exponential function leads us in a natural way to
the concept of Lie algebra.
Theorem 8.6 Let A, B : X →X be linear operators on the ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space X. Then there exists a number r > 0 such that (8.27), (8.28) hold true
if ||A|| ≤r and ||B|| ≤r.
Formula (8.27) is named after contributions made independently by Campbell,
Baker, and Hausdorﬀaround 1900. In 1950 Dynkin discovered the following explicit
formula:
r(A, B) =

Here, we use the operator ad : L(X) →L(X) given on the space L(X) of linear
operators on X. Explicitly, for each C ∈L(X), the linear operator ad C : X →X
is given by
(ad C)D := [C, D]−
for all
D ∈L(X).
The sum P′ refers to all integers l1, . . . , lk ≥0 and m1, . . . , mk ≥0 with mj +lj > 0
for all j. The proof can be found in Duistermaat and Kolk (2000), p. 30.

8.5 Regularizing Terms

8.5 Regularizing Terms
The naive use of perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld theory leads to divergent
mathematical expressions. In order to extract ﬁnite physical information from this,
physicists use the method of renormalization. In Volume II we will study quan-
tum electrodynamics. In this setting, renormalization can be understood best by
proceeding as follows.
(i) Put the quantum system in a box of ﬁnite volume V .
(ii) Consider a ﬁnite lattice in momentum space of grid length ∆p and maximal
momentum Pmax.
The maximal momentum corresponds to the choice of a maximal energy, Emax. We
then have to carry out the limits
V →+∞,
Emax →+∞,
∆p →0.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the naive limits do not always exist. Sometimes
divergent expressions arise.
The idea of the method of regularizing terms is to force convergence of diver-
gent expressions by introducing additional terms. This technique is well-known in
mathematics. In what follows we will study three prototypes, namely,
• the construction of entire functions via regularizing factors (the Weierstrass prod-
uct theorem),
• the construction of meromorphic functions via regularizing summands (the
Mittag–Leﬄer theorem), and
• the regularization of divergent integrals by adding terms to the integrand via
Taylor expansion.
In this monograph, we distinguish between
• regularizing terms and
• counterterms.
By convention, regularizing terms are mathematical objects which give divergent
expressions a well-deﬁned rigorous meaning. Counterterms are added to Lagrangian
densities in order to construct regularizing terms. Roughly speaking, this allows
us a physical interpretation of the regularizing terms. In quantum ﬁeld theory,
renormalization theory is based on counterterms.
8.5.1 The Weierstrass Product Theorem
Recall that by an entire function, we mean a function f : C →C which is holomor-
phic on the complex plane. The entire function f has no zeros iﬀthere exists an
entire function g : C →C such that
f(z) = eg(z)
for all
z ∈C.
Suppose that the function f is a polynomial which has the zeros z0, z1, . . . zm with
the multiplicities n0, . . . , nm, respectively, where z0 := 0 and zj ̸= 0 if j = 1, . . . , m.
Then

8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
Here, a is a complex number. If z = 0 is not a zero of f, then the factor zn0 drops
out. Now consider the case where the function f has an inﬁnite number of zeros.
The key formula reads as
f(z) = eg(z)zn0

(8.30)
The point is that the naive generalization of (8.29) fails, but we have to add the
regularizing factors epk(z) which force the convergence of the product.
Theorem 8.7 Let f : C →C be an entire function which has an inﬁnite number
of zeros z0, z1, . . . ordered by modulus, |z0| < |z1| < . . . with z0 := 0. Let nk be
the multiplicity of the zero zk. Then, there exist polynomials p1, p2, .. and an entire
function g such that the product formula (8.30) holds true.
This classical theorem is due to Weierstrass (1815–1897). The proof can be found
in Remmert (1998), Sect. 3.1.
8.5.2 The Mittag–Leﬄer Theorem
We want to generalize the decomposition into partial fractions from rational func-
tions to meromorphic functions. As prototypes, let us consider the two functions
f(z) :=
2z
(z −i)(z + i) = A−
z −i + A+
z + i
with A± = limz→±i f(z)(z ± i) = 1, and
π cot πz = π cos πz
sin πz .
The function z →sin πz has precisely the zeros zk := k with k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
Since limz→zk π(z −zk) cot πz = 1, we get the representation
π cot πz =
1
z −zk
+ gk(z),
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
for all z diﬀerent from zk in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the point zk.
The function gk is locally holomorphic at the point zk. Thus, the given function
z →cot πz has a pole of ﬁrst order at each point zk with the principal part 1/(z−zk).
Motivated by the decomposition into partial fractions of the function f, we make
the ansatz6
π cot πz =
∞
X
k=−∞

z −zk
.
However, this ansatz does not work, since the series is not convergent. We have to
pass to the modiﬁed sum

with the so-called regularizing terms Ck := 1/k for k = ±1, ±2, . . . and C0 := 0.
These regularizing terms force the convergence of the series from (8.31) for all
complex points z diﬀerent from the critical points zk with k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . In
1748 Euler incorporated this formula in his Introductio.7 Interestingly enough, the
regularizing terms cancel if we combine the right terms with each other. Explicitly,

A similar cancellation was observed by Brown and Feynman in 1952 when com-
puting radiative corrections to Compton scattering.8 Generally, such cancellations
occur in renormalization theory for low energies if one takes the full set of possible
Feynman diagrams into account.
Theorem 8.8 Let f : C →C be a meromorphic function on the complex plane
which has an inﬁnite number of poles z0, z1, . . . ordered by modulus, |z0| < |z1| < . . .
Let fk denote the principal part of the function f at the pole zk. Then, there exist
polynomials p0, p1, .. and an entire function g such that
f(z) = g(z) +

X
k=0
fk(z) −pk(z)
for all complex numbers z diﬀerent from z0, z1, . . .
The polynomials pk are called regularizing terms. This classical theorem is due to
Mittag–Leﬄer (1846–1927). The proof can be found in Remmert (1998), Sect. 6.1.
8.5.3 Regularization of Divergent Integrals
Let f : R →R be a continuous function, and let ϱ be a real number. Consider the
integral
E(R) :=
Z R
ϱ
f(x)dx.
Suppose that
E(R) = a ln R + g(R)
(8.32)
for a ﬁxed nonzero real number number a and all suﬃciently large real real numbers
R. In addition, suppose that the ﬁnite limit limR→+∞g(R) exists. In the classical
sense,
Z ∞

The regularized integral is deﬁned by

8. Rigorous Finite-Dimensional Perturbation Theory
This value is well-deﬁned. In fact, suppose that there exists a second decomposition
Z R
ϱ
f(x)dx = a1 ln R + g1(R)
where a ̸= a1. Then, (a −a1) ln R + g(R) −g1(R) = 0. Letting R →+∞, we get a
contradiction. Therefore, a = a1 and g = g1.
Regularizing terms. Suppose that the function f behaves asymptotically like
f(x) = a
x + O

x →+∞
(8.34)
where a is a nonzero real number. Let ϱ > 0. Then

This implies

Z ∞

(8.35)
The second integral is ﬁnite. The term −a
x is called regularizing term.
Example. It follows from

Physical interpretation. Regard E(R) above as the energy of a quantum
system on the interval [ϱ, R]. This energy is very large if the size of the system is
very large. Such extremely large energies are not observed in physical experiments.
Physicists assume that we only measure relative energies with respect to the ground
state. In our model above, we measure E(R) −a ln R. In the limit R →+∞, we
get the regularized value reg E(∞).
The method of subtracting inﬁnities. Suppose that the integral
R ∞

f(x)dx
is ﬁnite. For given nonzero real number b,
Z ∞

(b + f(x))dx = (sgn b) ∞.
Since

This procedure helps to cancel inﬁnities in renormalization theory.

8.5.4 The Polchinski Equation
Suppose again that the function f has the asymptotic behavior given in (8.34).
Then
lim
R→+∞Rf(R) = a.
Consequently, the coeﬃcient a of the regularizing term can be uniquely determined
by using the equation

(8.36)
This is the prototype of the so-called Polchinski equation which plays an important
role in modern renormalization theory based on the renormalization group. We will
study this in a later volume. We also refer to J. Polchinski, Renormalization and
eﬀective Lagrangians, Nucl. Phys. B 231 (1984), 269–295.

9. Fermions and the Calculus for Grassmann
Variables
In 1844, Hermann Grassmann (1809–1877) emphasized the importance
of the wedge product (Grassmann product) for geometry in higher di-
mensions. But his contemporaries did not understand him. Nowadays the
wedge product is fundamental for modern mathematics (cohomology) and
physics (fermions and supersymmetry).
Folklore
Recall that we distinguish between bosons (elementary particles with integer spin
like photons or mesons) and fermions (elementary particles with half-integer spin
like electrons and quarks). The rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional approach from the pre-
ceding Chap. 7 refers to bosons. However, it is possible to extend this approach to
fermions by replacing complex numbers by Grassmann variables. In this chapter,
we are going to discuss this.
9.1 The Grassmann Product
Vectors. Let X be a complex linear space. For two elements ϕ and ψ of X, we
deﬁne the Grassmann product ϕ ∧ψ by setting
(ϕ ∧ψ)(f, g) := f(ϕ)g(ψ) −f(ψ)g(ϕ)
for all
f, g ∈Xd.
Recall that the dual space Xd consists of all linear functionals f : X →C. The map
ϕ ∧ψ : Xd × Xd →C
is bilinear and antisymmetric. Explicitly, for all f, g, h ∈Xd and all complex num-
bers α, β, we have
• (ϕ ∧ψ)(f, g) = −(ϕ ∧ψ)(g, f);
• (ϕ ∧ψ)(f, αg + βh) = α(ϕ ∧ψ)(f, g) + β(ϕ ∧ψ)(f, h).
The two crucial properties of the Grassmann product are
• ϕ ∧ψ = −ψ ∧ϕ (anticommutativity), and
• (αϕ + βχ) ∧ψ = αϕ ∧ψ + βχ ∧ψ (distributivity)
for all ϕ, ψ, χ ∈X and all complex numbers α, β. If we write brieﬂy ϕψ instead of
the wedge product ϕ ∧ψ, then
• ϕψ = −ψϕ, and
• (αϕ + βχ)ψ = αϕψ + βχψ.

516
9. Fermions and the Calculus for Grassmann Variables
This implies the key relation
ϕ2 = 0
for all
ϕ ∈X.
Functionals. Dually, for f, g ∈Xd, we deﬁne
(f ∧g)(ϕ, ψ) := f(ϕ)g(ψ) −f(ψ)g(ϕ)
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
The map f ∧g : X × X →C is bilinear and antisymmetric.
9.2 Diﬀerential Forms
Dual basis. Let b1, . . . , bn be a basis of the complex linear space X. We deﬁne the
linear functional bi : X →C by setting
bi(β1b1 + . . . + βnbn) := βi,
i = 1, . . . , n
for all complex numbers β1, . . . , βn. We call b1, . . . , bn the dual basis to b1, . . . , bn.
The expressions
n

i=1
αibi
and

i,j=1

(9.1)
are called 1-forms and 2-forms on X, respectively. Here, the coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn
and α12, . . . are complex numbers with αij = −αji for all i, j.
Terminology. In modern mathematics, one writes
dxi
instead of
bi.
Using this convention, the diﬀerential forms (9.1) are written as

9.3 Calculus for One Grassmann Variable
Consider the set of all formal power series expansions
α + βη + γη2 + . . .
(9.3)
with respect to the variable η and complex coeﬃcients α, β, . . . . Add the relations
η2 = 0
and αη = ηα for all complex numbers α. This way, the expansion (9.3) reduces to
α + βη. This procedure allows us to deﬁne functions of the Grassmann variable η.
For example, for each complex number α, we deﬁne
eαη := 1 + αη.
This is motivated by the formal power series expansion
eαη = 1 + αη + 1
2(αη)2 + . . . = 1 + αη.
For all complex numbers α, β, we deﬁne

9.4 Calculus for Several Grassmann Variables

• derivative:
d
dη (α + βη) := β;
• integral:
R
(α + βη)dη := β.
The reader should note that in the case of Grassmann variables, derivative and
integral coincide.
9.4 Calculus for Several Grassmann Variables
We now consider the set of all formal power series expansions
α0 + α1η1 + . . . + αnηn + α12η1η2 + . . .
with respect to the variables η1, . . . , ηn and complex coeﬃcients α1, α2, . . . . We add
the relations
ηiηj = −ηjηi,
αηi = ηiα,
i, j = 1, . . . , n,
α ∈C.
This implies η2
i = 0 for all i.
• The left partial derivative
∂l
∂ηk f(η1, . . . , ηn) is performed after moving the variable
ηk to the left. For example,
∂l
∂η2 (η2η1) = η1
and
∂l
∂η2 (η1η2) = ∂l
∂η2 (−η2η1) = −η1.
In general we have the anticommutativity property
∂2
l
∂η1∂η2 = −
∂2
l
∂η2∂η1 .
(9.4)
• Similarly, the right partial derivative
∂r
∂ηk f(η1, . . . , ηn) is performed after moving
the variable ηk to the right. For example,
∂r
∂η2 (η2η1) = ∂r
∂η2 (−η1η2) = −η1.
As for the left partial derivative, we have the anticommutativity property
∂2
r
∂η1∂η2 = −
∂2
r
∂η2∂η1 .
(9.5)
• By deﬁnition, the integral
Z
f(η1, . . . , ηn)dη1 · · · dηn := c
is equal to the coeﬃcient c of ηnηn−1 · · · η1 in the expansion of f,
f(η1, . . . , ηn) = c(ηnηn−1 · · · η1) + . . . .
For example, η1η2 = −η2η1 implies
Z
η1η2dη1dη2 = −1.

9.5 The Determinant Trick
Gaussian integrals play a fundamental role in the functional integral approach to
the Standard Model in particle physics. We want to generalize the formula
Z
eζαηdηdζ = α
for all
α ∈C
with respect to the Grassmann variables η, ζ to 2n variables. To this end, let
η1, . . . , ηn, ζ1, . . . , ζn variables which satisfy the following relations
ηiηj = −ηjηi,
ζiζj = −ζjζi,
ηiζj = −ζjηi + γδij
for all i, j = 1, . . . , n and ﬁxed complex number γ.

expansion of the integrand,

= c(η2ζ2η1ζ1) + . . .
The dots denote the remaining terms. It turns out that
c = a11a22 −a12a21 = det(A).
Let us show this. Since ζ2η2 = −η2ζ2 + γ, we get
ζ1η1ζ2η2 = −ζ1η1η2ζ2 + γζ1η1.
Furthermore, it follows from η1η2 = −η2η1 and ζ1η2 = −η2ζ1 that
ζ1η1ζ2η2 = −η2ζ1η1ζ2 + . . . = −η2ζ2ζ1η1 + . . . = η2ζ2η1ζ1 + . . . .
The dots denote terms that contain less than four factors. This implies
1
2(ζ1a11η1)(ζ2a22η2) = 1
2 a11a22(η2ζ2η1ζ1) + . . .
The same expression is obtained for 1
2(ζ2a22η2)(ζ1a11η1). Similarly, we get
1
2(ζ1a12η2)(ζ2a21η1) = −1
2 a12a21(η2ζ2η1ζ1) + . . . ,
and the same expression is obtained for 1
2(ζ2a21η1)(ζ1a12η2).
(II) For n = 3, 4, . . ., the proof proceeds analogously.

9.7 The Fermionic Response Model
519
The Grassmannian-Gaussian integral (9.6) has the advantage over the clas-
sical Gaussian integral (9.7) that the determinant det A appears in the nu-
merator.
This simpliﬁes computations in physics. As a typical application, we will introduce
the Faddeev–Popov trick in Sect. 16.6 on page 889. This trick introduces ghosts
into gauge ﬁeld theories in order to guarantee the crucial unitarity of the S-matrix.
9.6 The Method of Stationary Phase
We want to compute the following Grassmann integral
W (J, J) :=
Z
eΦ(ψ,ψ,J,J)
N
Y
k=1
dψ(k)dψ(k)
(9.8)
with the phase function
Φ(ψ, ψ, J, J) := iψAψ + iψJ + iJψ.
Let us ﬁrst explain the notation.
• For ﬁxed N = 1, 2, . . . , the complex (N × N)-matrix A is invertible.
• The quantities ψ(k), ψ(k), J(k), J(k) with k = 1, . . . N form a sequence χ1, . . . χ4N
of Grassmann variables, that is,
χiχj = −χjχi,
i, j = 1, . . . , 4N.
In particular, the symbol QN
k=1 dψ(k)dψ(k) stands for the ordered product
dψ(1)dψ(1) · · · dψ(N)dψ(N).
• We use the following matrices
ψ =

along with ψ = (ψ(1), . . . , ψ(N)) and J = (J(1), . . . , J(N)).
The proof of the following theorem proceeds analogously to the proof of Theorem
7.36 on page 438.
Theorem 9.2 W (J, J) = e−iJA−1J W (0, 0).
9.7 The Fermionic Response Model
The global quantum action principle. Parallel to Sect. 7.26 on page 477, we
study the generating functional
Z(J, J) = N

along with the action functional
S[ψ, ψ, J, J] := ⟨ψ|(D + iεI)ψ⟩+ κ⟨1|Lint(ψ, ψ)⟩+
+⟨J|ψ⟩+ ⟨ψ|J⟩.
The detailed notation can be found in (7.161) on page 477. In contrast to Sect.
7.26, we now assume that the quantities
ψ(x), ψ(x), J(x), J(x)
are not complex numbers, but independent Grassmann variables. Here, the index
x denotes an arbitrary discrete space-time point, that is, x ∈M. Explicitly, the
functional integral is to be understood as the following integral
Z(J, J) = N
Z
eiS[ψ,ψ,J,J]/ℏ
Y
x∈M
dψ(x)dψ(x)
with respect to Grassmann variables. The normalization factor N has to be chosen
in such a way that Z(0, 0) = 1. The symbol Q
x∈M dψ(x)dψ(x) stands for the
product
dψ(1)dψ(1) · · · dψ(N)dψ(N)
where the discrete space-time points x ∈M are numbered in a ﬁxed order.
The magic quantum action reduction formula. The point is that this
formula reads as in the case of the extended response model considered in Sect.
7.26. Explicitly,
Z(J, J) = exp

The proof proceeds analogously to the proof given in Sect. 7.24 on page 438. Observe
that, in the present case, we have to use the principle of stationary phase for
integrals with Grassmann variables from Sect. 9.6. The diﬀerent determinant tricks
for Gaussian and Grassmannian–Gaussian integrals do not matter, since the choice
of the normalization factor N always cancels the diﬀerent determinants.
The magic LSZ reduction formula. From the quantum action reduction
formula above, we get the LSZ reduction formula as in Sect. 7.26. We will come
back to this in connection with the Standard Model in particle physics. We also
refer to Faddeev and Slavnov (1980).

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Quantum ﬁelds possess an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. This
causes a lot of mathematical trouble.
Folklore
Smooth functions. Let Ωbe an open subset of RN, N = 1, 2, . . . The function
f : Ω→C is called smooth iﬀit is continuous and the partial derivatives of f
of arbitrary order are also continuous on Ω. For the theory of inﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces and its applications in physics, it is important to use not only smooth
functions, but also reasonable discontinuous functions which are limits of smooth
functions. Here, we use pointwise limits, limn→∞fn(x) = f(x) for all x ∈Ω, and
more general limits in the sense of the averaging over integrals, for example,
lim
n→∞
Z
Ω
|fn(x) −f(x)|2dNx = 0.
Furthermore, it is important to replace the classical Riemann integral by the modern
Lebesgue integral.
10.1 The Importance of Inﬁnite Dimensions in
Quantum Physics
We want to discuss why an inﬁnite number degrees of freedom for quantum physics
is inevitable. To this end, we will show that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
cannot be realized in a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space.
10.1.1 The Uncertainty Relation
Before you start to axiomatize things, be sure that you ﬁrst have something
of mathematical substance.
Hermann Weyl (1885–1955)
In 1927 Heisenberg (1901–1976) discovered that in contrast to Newton’s classical
mechanics, it is impossible to measure precisely position and momentum of a quan-
tum particle at the same time. Heisenberg based his mathematical argument on the
commutation relation
QP −PQ = iℏI
(10.1)
for the position operator Q and the momentum operator P, along with the Schwarz
inequality.

522
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces fail. Observe ﬁrst that the fundamental
commutation relation (10.1) cannot be realized for observables Q and P living in
a nontrivial ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space X if the Planck constant ℏis diﬀerent
from zero. 1 Indeed, suppose that there exist two self-adjoint linear operators
Q, P : X →X
such that (10.1) holds true. By Proposition 7.11 on page 364, tr(QP) = tr(PQ).
This implies
0 = tr(QP −PQ) = iℏ· tr I = iℏdim X.
Thus, relation (10.1) forces the vanishing of the Planck constant ℏin the setting of
a nontrivial ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space.
A nontrivial mathematical model. Our goal is to construct a nontrivial
model which realizes the commutation relation (10.1). To this end, we choose the
space C2(R) which consists of all continuous functions ψ : R →C with the property
R ∞
−∞|ψ(x)|2dx < ∞. Deﬁne ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩:=
R ∞
−∞ϕ(x)†ψ(x)dx.
Proposition 10.1 For all functions ϕ, ψ ∈C2(R), the integral ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩is ﬁnite.
Proof. Set
an :=
Z n
−n
ϕ(x)†ψ(x)dx,
n = 1, 2, . . .
By the classical Schwarz inequality for integrals,
|an|2 ≤
Z n
−n
|ϕ(x)|2dx
Z n
−n
|ψ(x)|2dx.
This implies
|an|2 ≤
Z ∞
−∞
|ϕ(x)|2 dx
Z ∞
−∞
|ψ(x)|2 dx,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Thus, the sequence a1, a2, . . . is increasing and bounded. Consequently, the ﬁnite
limit limn→∞an exists.
2
Proposition 10.2 The space C2(R) is a complex pre-Hilbert space.
Proof. It can be checked easily that ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩possesses the properties (P1) through
(P5) from page 337. In particular, for a given continuous function ψ : R →C, we
have ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 0, that is,
Z
R
|ψ(x)|2dx = 0
iﬀthe function ψ vanishes identically.
2
Consider now the Schwartz space D(R) which consists of all smooth functions
ψ : R →C that vanish outside some ﬁnite interval. For all functions ψ ∈D(R), we
deﬁne the so-called position operator Q,
(Qψ)(x) := xψ(x)
for all
x ∈R,
and the so-called momentum operator P,
1 In the trivial Hilbert space {0}, relation (10.1) is obviously true.

10.1 The Importance of Inﬁnite Dimensions in Quantum Physics
523
(Pψ)(x) := −iℏdψ(x)
dx
for all
x ∈R.
For every function ϕ ∈D(R), we have the commutation relation
QPϕ −PQϕ = iℏϕ
on R.
(10.2)
In fact, PQϕ = −iℏϕ + QPϕ follows from the product rule,
d
dx(xϕ(x)) = ϕ(x) + xϕ′(x).
Finally, for all ϕ ∈D(R) with ||ϕ|| = 1, set
Q := ⟨ϕ|Qϕ⟩,
P := ⟨ϕ|Pϕ⟩,
as well as ∆Q := ||(Q −QI)ϕ|| and ∆P := ||(P −PI)ϕ||. In terms of physics, if
the quantum particle is in the state ϕ on the real line, then Q is the mean position
and ∆Q is the mean ﬂuctuation of the particle position. Similarly, P is the mean
momentum and ∆P is the mean ﬂuctuation of the particle momentum.
Proposition 10.3 There holds the Heisenberg uncertainty inequality
∆Q · ∆P ≥ℏ
2.
Proof. This is a special case of Theorem 10.4 below with the pre-Hilbert space
X := C(R)2, the linear subspace D := D(R) of X, and the identity operator
C := I. Note that the operators Q, P : D(R) →D(R) are formally self-adjoint. In
fact, for all ϕ, ψ ∈D(R), integration by parts yields
⟨ϕ|Pψ⟩=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†(−iℏ)ψ′(x)dx =
Z
R
(−iℏϕ′(x))†ψ(x)dx = ⟨Pϕ|ψ⟩.
Moreover,
⟨ϕ|Qψ⟩=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†xψ(x)dx =
Z
R
(xϕ(x))†ψ(x)dx = ⟨Qϕ|ψ⟩.

The abstract uncertainty theorem. We make the following assumptions.
(H1) We are given a linear subspace D of the complex inﬁnite-dimensional pre-
Hilbert space X.
(H2) The linear operators Q, P : D →X are formally self-adjoint, that is, we have
⟨Qϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|Qψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D.
The analogous formula is true if we replace Q by P.
(H3) If ϕ ∈D, then Qϕ ∈D and Pϕ ∈D.
(H4) For all ϕ ∈D, there holds the commutation relation
QPϕ −PQϕ = iℏCϕ.
Furthermore, for each ϕ ∈D with ||ϕ|| = 1, set C := ⟨ϕ|Cϕ⟩. Similarly, we deﬁne
Q := ⟨ϕ|Qϕ⟩and P := ⟨ϕ|Pϕ⟩. Furthermore, deﬁne
∆Q := ||(Q −QI)ϕ||,
∆P := ||(P −PI)ϕ||.
The following theorem is called the abstract uncertainty theorem.

524
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Theorem 10.4 There holds the inequality ∆Q · ∆P ≥1
2ℏ|C|.
Proof. Set z := ⟨(Q −QI)ϕ|(P −PI)ϕ⟩. By the Schwarz inequality,
|z| ≤||(Q −QI)ϕ|| · ||(P −PI)ϕ|| = ∆Q∆P.
Since Q and P are real numbers,
z −z† = ⟨(Q −QI)ϕ|(P −PI)ϕ⟩−⟨(P −PI)ϕ|(Q −QI)ϕ⟩
= ⟨ϕ|(Q −QI)(P −PI)ϕ⟩−⟨ϕ|(P −PI)(Q −QI)ϕ⟩
= ⟨ϕ|(QP −PQ)ϕ⟩= iℏ⟨ϕ|Cϕ⟩.
Finally,
ℏ|C| = |ℏ⟨ϕ|Cϕ⟩| = |z −z†| = |2iℑ(z)| ≤2|z| ≤2∆Q∆P.

10.1.2 The Trouble with the Continuous Spectrum
Let H : X →X be a linear self-adjoint operator on the complex ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space X. Then, the inverse operator
(H −EI)−1 : X →X
exists for all complex energy parameters E ∈C \ σ(H) up to a ﬁnite set of real
energy values, σ(H) := {E1, . . . , EN}. The set σ(H) is called the energy spectrum of
the operator H. In the ﬁnite-dimensional case, there exists a complete orthonormal
system |E1⟩, . . . |EN⟩in the Hilbert space X such that
H|Ej⟩= Ej|Ej⟩,
j = 1, . . . , N.
The situation may change dramatically in an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space X.
In such a space it is possible that the energy spectrum σ(H) contains a contin-
uum of energy values. For example, consider the electron of the hydrogen atom.
Then, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the spectrum of the corresponding
Hamiltonian H has the form
σ(H) = {E1, E2, . . .} ∪[0, ∞[
where
En := −mec2α2
2n2
,
n = 1, 2, . . . .
Here, we use the following notation: me rest mass of the electron, c velocity of light
in a vacuum, α = 137.04 ﬁne structure constant. Note the following two crucial
facts:
• the energy values E1, E2, . . . correspond to bound states of the electron in the
hydrogen atom, and
• the energy values E ∈[0, ∞[ correspond to scattering states (scattering of an
electron at the nucleus (proton) of the hydrogen atom).

10.2 The Hilbert Space L2(Ω)
525
In terms of our solar system, the bound states correspond to planets moving on
ellipses, and the scattering states correspond to comets moving on hyperbolas and
leaving the solar system for ever (Fig. 2.11 on page 121). For the hydrogen atom,
the point is that the bound states correspond to eigenvectors |E1⟩, |E2⟩, . . . of the
Hamiltonian H in the Hilbert space X = L2(R3), that is,
H|En⟩= En|En⟩,
n = 1, 2, . . . .
In contrast to this, the energy values E which lie in the continuous spectrum σcont :=
[0, ∞[ do not correspond to eigenvectors in the Hilbert space X, but to more general
objects ⟨E|,
H⟨E| = E⟨E|,
⟨E| ∈Y.
Here, the costate ⟨E| does not lie in the original Hilbert space X, but in some larger
space Y . For the spectral theory in terms of costates, see Sect. 12.2 on page 675.
Historical remarks. In Sect. 7.4, we introduced the notion of a ﬁnite-dimen-
sional Hilbert space. For quantum physics, it is crucial that the situation of ﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces can be generalized to inﬁnite dimensions. This represents
a far-reaching generalization of the classical Fourier method for solving partial dif-
ferential equations. The main contributions are due to the following mathematicians
and physicists:
• Fourier (1786–1830) in 1822 (the Fourier method for solving the heat equation),
• Cauchy (1789–1857) in 1826 (principal axis transformation for ﬁnite-dimensional
quadratic forms),
• Hilbert (1862–1943) in 1904 (principal axis transformation for inﬁnite-dimensio-
nal symmetric quadratic forms (symmetric matrices)),
• Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) in 1926 (application of the Fourier method to the spec-
trum of the hydrogen atom),
• von Neumann (1903–1957) in 1928 (spectral theory for unbounded self-adjoint
operators and the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics),
• Dirac (1902–1984) in 1930 (transformation theory and Dirac calculus),
• Laurent Schwartz in 1945 (theory of distributions),
• Gelfand and Kostyuchenko in 1955 (generalized eigenfunctions and rigorous jus-
tiﬁcation of the Dirac calculus).
Nowadays this is part of functional analysis and harmonic analysis. The point is
that the classical Fourier transform is closely related to the translation group on
the real line. If we replace the translation group by more general groups, then we
get more general eigenfunction expansions and integral transformations for broad
classes of special functions in mathematical physics. This goes back to
• Sturm (1803–1855) and Liouville (1818–1882) in 1836 and 1837, respectively.
In the 20th century, important contributions were made by
• Hermann Weyl (1885–1955) (representation theory for compact Lie groups),
• and Eugene Wigner (1902–1995) (representation theory of the noncompact
Poincar´e group).
10.2 The Hilbert Space L2(Ω)
Counterexample. In a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space as deﬁned in Sect. 7.4
on page 335, the completeness condition is automatically satisﬁed. The situation
changes essentially in the inﬁnite-dimensional case. To illustrate this, consider the

526
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
space C2(R) of continuous functions ψ : R →C with
R
R |ψ(x)|2dx < ∞. It follows
from the classical Schwarz inequality that for all ϕ, ψ ∈C2(R), the integral
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx
is ﬁnite. Equipped with this inner product, the space C2(R) becomes a complex
pre-Hilbert space.
Unfortunately, the space C2(R) is not a Hilbert space, since the complete-
ness condition fails.
In fact, it can be shown that there exists a sequence (ψn) of continuous functions
ψn in the space C2(R) such that for each number ε > 0, there exists an index n0(ε)
with
||ψm −ψn|| =
„Z
R
|ψm(x) −ψn(x)|2dx
«1/2
< ε
for all m, n ≥n0(ε). But there does not exist any continuous function ψ in the
space C2(R) such that
lim
n→∞||ψn −ψ|| = lim
n→∞
„Z
R
|ψn(x) −ψ(x)|2dx
«1/2
= 0.
The point is that such a function ψ only exists if
• we allow the use of discontinuous functions, and
• we replace the classical Riemann integral by the more general Lebesgue integral.
This integral was introduced by Henri Lebesgue in his 1902 Paris dissertation. Using
the Lebesgue integral, the space C2(R) can be extended to some space L2(R), that
is,
C2(R) ⊂L2(R)
such that L2(R) is a complex Hilbert space. In particular, the space L2(R) contains
a class of reasonable discontinuous functions ψ : R →C. Moreover, the properties
of the Lebesgue integral force the validity of the completeness relation with respect
to the inner product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx.
Explicitly, the completeness condition means the following. Suppose that we are
given a sequence (ψn) of functions ψn in the space L2(R) such that for each number
ε > 0, there exists an index n0(ε) with
||ψm −ψn|| =
„Z
R
|ψm(x) −ψn(x)|2dx
«1/2
< ε
for all m, n ≥n0(ε). There exists then a function ψ ∈L2(R) such that ψn →ψ in
L2(R) as n →∞. This means that
lim
n→∞||ψn −ψ|| = lim
n→∞
„Z
R
|ψn(x) −ψ(x)|2dx
«1/2
= 0.
Let us discuss the main points. In what follows, we formulate the statements
for the N-dimensional space RN with N = 1, 2, . . . Note the following special cases.

10.2 The Hilbert Space L2(Ω)
527
• For N = 1, the space R1 coincides with the real line, and 1-dimensional cubes
are intervals.
• For N = 2, the space R2 coincides with the plane, and 2-dimensional cubes are
squares.
For x ∈RN, recall that ||x|| :=
p
x2
1 + . . . x2
N.
Using an intuitive picture, the incomplete space C2(R) and the complete
space L2(R) correspond to the incomplete space of rational numbers Q and
the complete space of real numbers R, respectively.
A Cauchy sequence (xn) of rational numbers x1, x2, . . . is does not always converge
to a rational number. However, if we complete the space of rational numbers to
the space of real numbers by introducing irrational numbers, then each Cauchy
sequence of real numbers converges to a real number. The term ‘irrational number’
indicates that in the history of mathematics, mathematicians had philosophical
trouble with understanding this notion.
10.2.1 Measure and Integral
Almost all concepts which relate to the modern measure and integration
theory, go back to the works of Lebesgue (1875–1941). The introduction of
these concepts was the turning point in the transition from mathematics
of the 19th century to mathematics of the 20th century.
Naum Vilenkin
Our goal is to introduce the integral
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) =
J
X
j=1
f(xj)mj
and to generalize it to the prototype
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) =
Z
RN f(x)ϱ(x)dNx +
∞
X
j=1
f(xj)mj.
Intuitively, the function ϱ represents a mass density on RN, and mj is the mass at
the point xj in RN. On the real line, the value
x =
R
R xdµ(x)
R
R dµ(x)
represents the center of gravity of the mass distribution. This measure integral
includes ﬁnite sums, inﬁnite series, and traditional integrals, as special cases. This
generality is needed for obtaining expansion formulas of the following form,
F(y) =
Z
RN K(y, x)dµ(x),
y ∈RN.
Such general expansions appear in von Neumann’s and Dirac’s operator calculus.
This plays a fundamental role in quantum physics. These expansion formulas gener-
alize the Fourier series of periodic functions and the Fourier transform. Furthermore,
the measure integral is the natural setting for the theory of probability. Mass has
then to be replaced by probability.

528
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Measure theory begins with Archimedes of Syracus (287–212 B.C.) who com-
puted the measure of the unit circle, S1. Using a polygon with 96 nodes, he obtained
the approximation µ(S1) = 6.28 which corresponds to π = 3.14. Around 1900, mod-
ern measure theory was founded by Borel (1871–1956) and Lebesgue (1875–1941).
In 1932 Kolmogorov (1903–1987) used general measure theory in order to found the
modern theory of probability. For example, the crucial mean value of the random
function f : RN →R is deﬁned by
¯f :=
R
RN f(x)dµ(x)
R
RN dµ(x)
.
Deﬁnition of measure. The notion of measure generalizes the intuitive notion
of volume, mass, positive electric charge, and probability. Suppose we are given an
arbitrary set S. To certain subsets A of the set S we want to assign a number, µ(A),
with
0 ≤µ(A) ≤∞.
The number µ(A) is called the measure of the set A.2 More precisely, by a measure
we understand a map µ : A →[0, ∞] which has the following properties:
(P1) σ-algebra: The members of A are subsets of S including the set S and the
empty set, ∅. If A, B, A1, A2, .. are members of A, then so are
A \ B,
A ∪B,
A ∩B,
∞
[
n=1
An,
∞
\
n=1
An.
(P2) Additivity: If A and B are disjoint members of A, then
µ(A ∪B) = µ(A) + µ(B).
(P3) σ-additivity: If (An) is a pairwise disjoint family of members from A, then
µ
 ∞
[
n=1
An
!
=
∞
X
n=1
µ(An).
The members of A are called measurable sets (with respect to µ). The measure is
called ﬁnite iﬀµ(S) < ∞. By a zero set, we understand a set whose measure is
zero. The measure is called complete iﬀsubsets of zero sets are always zero sets.
Measurable functions. The function f : S →C is called measurable iﬀthe
preimage of open sets is measurable.
Step functions. Let us start with the formula
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) =
J
X
j=1
fjµ(Aj).
for step functions. By deﬁnition, the function f : RN →C is called a step function
iﬀthere exists a ﬁnite number A1, . . . , Am of subsets of RN with ﬁnite measure
such that f is constant on Aj with value fj for all j, and f vanishes outside the
sets A1, . . . , AJ.
Measure integral. For a function f : RN →C, we deﬁne the integral by the
key formula
2 In the theory of probability, µ(S) := 1.

10.2 The Hilbert Space L2(Ω)
529
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) := lim
n→∞
Z
RN fn(x)dµ(x)
(10.3)
where fn : RN →C are step functions, n = 1, 2, . . . More precisely, assume that the
following hold true.
(H1) Convergence almost everywhere: There exists a sequence (fn) of step functions
such that
lim
n→∞fn(x) = f(x)
for all x ∈RN with the possible exception of a zero set.
(H2) Mean square approximation: The sequence (fn) is Cauchy with respect to the
mean square norm, that is, for each number ε > 0, there exists an index n0(ε)
with
Z
RN |fn(x) −fm(x)|2dµ(x) < ε
for all
n, m ≥n0(ε).
This integral is to be understood in the sense of step functions.
Theorem 10.5 The ﬁnite limit (10.3) exists and is independent of the choice of
the step functions.
Precisely in this case, we say that the integral
R
RN f(x)dµ(x) exists. This is equiv-
alent to the existence of the integral
R
RN |f(x)|dµ(x).3
The integral
R
S f(x)dµ(x) is deﬁned analogously by replacing the set RN by S.
The value of the integral
R
S f(x)dµ(x) remains invariant if we change the function
f on a zero set.
Majorant criterion. If f, g : S →C are measurable and
|f(x)| ≤g(x)
for all
x ∈S,
then the existence of the integral
R
S g(x)dµ(x) implies the existence of the integral
R
S f(x)dµ(x), and we have the inequalities
˛˛˛˛
Z
S

10.2.2 Dirac Measure and Dirac Integral
The Dirac measure. Fix a point x0 in RN. For an arbitrary subset A of RN,
deﬁne
µ(A) :=
(
1
if x0 ∈A,
0
if x0 ̸∈A.
Each subset A of RN and each function f : RN →C is measurable. For the integral,4
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) = f(x0).
3 For the function f(x)
≡
1, the integral
R
R f(x)dx does not exist. Since
limR→+∞
R R
−R dx = ∞, we say that the integral is divergent.
4 Physicists write formally
R
RN f(x)δ(x −x0)dNx = f(x0).

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Finite number of mass points. Assign the positive mass m1, . . . , mJ to
the points x1, . . . , xJ in RN, respectively. By deﬁnition, the measure µ(A) of an
arbitrary subset A of RN is equal to the total mass of this set. For example, if
x1, x2 ∈A and x2, . . . , xJ lie outside A, then µ(A) = m1 + m2. For an arbitrary
function f : RN →C,
Z
RN f(x)dµ(x) =

f(xj)mj.
10.2.3 Lebesgue Measure and Lebesgue Integral
Characterization of the Lebesgue measure by translation invariance. The
Lebesgue measure generalizes the classical volume of a set in RN.
Theorem 10.6 There exists precisely one complete measure on RN which general-
izes the elementary measure of open cubes and which is invariant under translations.
This measure is called the N-dimensional Lebesgue measure on RN. In particular,
open and closed subsets of RN are measurable. As a rule of thumb, non-measurable
sets and functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure are highly pathological.
Zero sets. A subset of RN is called a zero set iﬀit has the N-dimensional
Lebesgue measure zero. The set A is a zero set iﬀfor each ε > 0, there exists a
system J1, J2, . . . of open N-dimensional cubes which cover the set A and whose
total volume is less than ε. For example, the sets
{x1, . . . , xn},
n = 1, 2, . . .
or
{x1, x2, . . .}
of a ﬁnite or countable number of points in RN are zero sets. Roughly speaking, a
subset of RN is a zero set if its dimension is less than N. For example, the boundary
of a ball or a cube in RN is a zero set.
Almost everywhere continuous functions. By deﬁnition, the given func-
tion f : RN →C is almost everywhere continuous iﬀit is continuous for all points
of RN with possible exception of a zero set.5
The Lebesgue integral. The Lebesgue integral refers to the Lebesgue mea-
sure. Note the following:
If the classical Riemann integral
R
RN |f(x)|dNx is ﬁnite, then the Lebesgue
integral
R
RN f(x)dNx exists and is equal to the Riemann integral.
In this monograph, all the integrals
R
RN f(x)dNx are to be understood in the sense
of Lebesgue.
Example. If the function f : RN →C is almost every continuous and satisﬁes
the following growth condition
|f(x)| ≤
const
1 + ||x||N+1
for all
x ∈RN,
then the Lebesgue integral
R
RN f(x)dNx exists. In contrast to the Riemann integral,
the Lebesgue integral possesses the following nice property concerning limits. We
have
5 Generally, a property is true almost everywhere on RN iﬀit is true for all points
of RN with possible exception of a zero set.

10.2 The Hilbert Space L2(Ω)

if the following are met:
(H1) The integral

RN fn(x)dNx exists for each n.
(H2) The limit f(x) := limn→∞fn(x) exists almost everywhere on RN.
(H3) Majorant condition: There exists an integrable function g : RN →C such
that |fn(x)| ≤g(x) almost everywhere on RN for all n.
10.2.4 The Fischer–Riesz Theorem
By deﬁnition, the Lebesgue space L2(RN) consists of all complex-valued measurable
functions ψ : RN →C with
R
RN |ψ(x)|2dNx < ∞.
Theorem 10.7 The space L2(RN) is a complex inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space
with respect to the inner product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
Z
RN ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dNx.
This fundamental theorem of modern analysis was proven independently by Ernst
Fischer (1875–1954) and Fryges Riesz (1880–1956) in 1907. Note that, by deﬁnition,
two functions ψ and ϕ represent the same element of the Hilbert space L2(RN) iﬀ
they diﬀer on a zero set. In the Hilbert space L2(RN), the convergence
lim
n→∞ψn = ψ
means explicitly that
lim
n→∞||ψn −ψ|| =
„Z
RN |ψn(x) −ψ(x)|2dNx
«1/2
= 0.
This is called mean-square convergence.
If we replace RN by a measurable subset Ωof RN (e.g., Ωis open or closed),
then we obtain the Hilbert space L2(Ω) with the inner product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
Z
Ω
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dNx.

10.3.1 Gauss’ Method of Least Squares
Orthonormal system. Let X be a complex inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space.
By deﬁnition, the elements ϕ1, . . . , ϕn of X form an orthonormal system iﬀ
⟨ϕj|ϕk⟩= δjk,
j, k = 1, . . . , n.
For each given ψ ∈X, we deﬁne the Fourier coeﬃcients by setting
ak(ψ) := ⟨ϕk|ψ⟩,
k = 1, . . . , n.
As we will show below, this deﬁnition generalizes the classical Fourier coeﬃcients.
Theorem 10.8 The Fourier coeﬃcients a1(ψ), . . . , an(ψ) are the unique solution
of the minimum problem
||ψ −a1ϕ1 −. . . −anϕn||2 = min!,
a1, . . . , an ∈C
which is the abstract form of Gauss’ least square method.
Completeness. The orthonormal system ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . in the Hilbert space X is
called complete iﬀfor all ψ ∈X, the Fourier series is convergent,
ψ =

(10.4)
This means that limn→∞|| Pn

have the Parseval equation

The key observation is the following integral relation
Z π
−π
ϕp(x)†ϕq(x)dx = δpq,
p, q = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
To translate this classical identity into the language of Hilbert spaces, let L2(−π, π)
denote the space of all measurable6 functions ψ :] −π, π[→C with
Z π

|ψ(x)|2dx < ∞.
The space L2(−π, π) becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped with the inner

Then ⟨ϕp|ϕq⟩= δpq for all p, q = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
Theorem 10.9 The system ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ−1, . . . forms a complete orthonormal system

• Consistency: f ∗g : R →C is 2π-periodic and continuous.
• Commutativity: f ∗g = g ∗f.
• Associativity: (f ∗g) ∗h = f ∗(g ∗h).
• Linearity: (αf + βg) ∗h = αf ∗h + βg ∗h for all complex numbers α, β.

10.3.3 Continuous Fourier Transform
Let us ﬁrst summarize the key formulas which will be used frequently in this mono-
graph. The validity of these formulas will be discussed below.
Key formulas on the real line. For the Fourier transform Fψ : R →C of a
function ψ : R →C on the real line, the following are met.
(i) Fourier transform:
(Fψ)(p) :=

ψ(x)†χ(x)dx = ⟨Fψ|Fχ⟩.
(10.13)
Physical interpretation in quantum mechanics. In terms of physics, the
original function ψ acts in position space, whereas the Fourier transform Fψ acts
in momentum space. In quantum mechanics, the function ψ = ψ(x) is the wave
function of a quantum particle on the real line. The operator
(Pψ)(x) := −iℏd
dx ψ(x)
represents the momentum operator of the particle. Setting
ψp(x) := eipx/ℏ
√
2πℏ
,
we get Pψp = pψp for each real value p of momentum. To simplify notation, we set
ℏ= 1.
The Fourier transform represents an expansion with respect to the eigen-
functions of the momentum operator.
The normalization factor 1/
√
2π of the eigenfunction ψp is dictated by the Dirac
calculus (see Sect. 11.2 on page 589) and the fact that the operator F can be
uniquely extended to a unitary operator on the Hilbert space L2(R).
By (iii) above, the momentum operator P corresponds to the multiplication
operator
(Fψ)(p) →p(Fψ)(p)
in momentum space. This tells us that the Fourier transform is related to a diago-
nalization of the momentum operator, P = −iℏd

proved that each self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space can be realized as mul-
tiplication operator on a suitable function space (see the von Neumann spectral
theorem in Sect. 11.2.3 on page 678).
Key formulas on RN. For the Fourier transform Fψ : RN →C of a function
ψ : RN →C, the following hold true.
(i) Fourier transform:
(Fψ)(p) :=
1
(2π)N/2
Z
RN f(x) e−i⟨p|x⟩dNx,
p ∈RN.
(ii) Inverse Fourier transform:
ψ(x) =

Z
RN (Fψ)(p) ei⟨p|x⟩dNx,
x ∈RN.
(10.14)
(iii) Transformation of derivatives: For partial derivatives of arbitrary order,
∂αψ(x) =
1
(2π)N/2
Z
RN i|α|pα(Fψ)(p) ei⟨p|x⟩dNx,
x ∈RN.
(iv) The Parseval equation:
⟨ψ|χ⟩=
Z
RN ψ(x)†χ(x)dNx =
Z
RN (Fψ)(x)†(Fχ)(x)dNx = ⟨Fψ|Fχ⟩.
This implies the modiﬁed Parseval equation
Z
RN ψ(x)(Fχ)(x)dNx =
Z
RN (Fψ)(x)χ(x)dNx.
Here, we use the following notation
x = (x1, . . . , xN), p = (p1, . . . , pN), ⟨p|x⟩:=
N
X
j=1
pjxj,
along with the norm ||x|| :=
p
(x1)2 + . . . + (xN)2. Furthermore, we set
∂j :=
∂
∂xj ,
j = 1, . . . , N.
For partial derivatives of arbitrary order, we will use the symbol
∂αψ := ∂α1
1 ∂α2
2
· · · ∂αN
N
=
∂|α|ψ
(∂x1)α1(∂x2)α2 · · · (∂xN)αN .
(10.15)
Here, the multi-index α := (α1, . . . , αN) has nonnegative integers α1, . . . , αN as
components. Moreover, the order of the partial derivative ∂α is given by the integer
|α| := α1 + . . . + αN. Similarly,
pα := pα1
1 pα2
2 · · · pαN
N .
To simplify notation, we include the trivial multi-index α = (0, . . . , 0) which corre-
sponds to the function itself, ∂αψ = ψ.

10.3 Harmonic Analysis

The Schwartz space S(RN) of rapidly decreasing functions. In order
to guarantee the existence of the Fourier integral, we have to assume that the
functions ψ decrease rapidly at inﬁnity. For example, the Gaussian function, given
by ψ(x) := e−||x||2/2, has the Fourier transform
(Fψ)(p) =
1
(2π)N/2
Z
RN e−i⟨p|x⟩e−||x||2/2 dNx = e−||p||2/2
for all p ∈RN. This is a typical element of the space S(RN). By deﬁnition, the
space S(RN) consists of all the smooth functions ψ : RN →C which satisfy the
decay condition
|∂αψ(x)| = O
„
1
||x||M
«
,
||x|| →∞
for all positive integers M and all multi-indices α.
Theorem 10.12 The Fourier transform is a bijective map
F : S(RN) →S(RN)
from the space S(RN) onto itself. In addition, the inverse Fourier transform is given
by the classical formula above. For all ψ, χ ∈S(RN), both the Parseval equation
and the modiﬁed Parseval equation are valid.
In order to formulate continuity properties of the Fourier transform, we intro-
duce the semi-norms
|ψ|M,α := sup
x∈RN(1 + ||x||M)|Dαψ(x)|
for all integers M and all multi-indices α. We write
lim
n→∞ψn = ψ
in
S(RN)
(10.16)
iﬀlimn→+∞|ψn −ψ|M,α = 0 for all possible M, α. The convergence (10.16) implies
the convergence
lim
n→∞F(ψn) = F(ψ)
in
S(RN).
The same is true for the inverse operator F−1. We say brieﬂy that the operators
F, F−1 : S(RN) →S(RN) are sequentially continuous.
The convolution theorem. Let N = 1, 2, . . . . We are given the functions
ϕ, ψ, χ ∈S(RN). The function ϕ ∗ψ deﬁned by
(ϕ ∗ψ)(x) :=
Z
RN ϕ(x −y)ψ(y)dNy
for all
x ∈RN
is called the convolution of ϕ with ψ. We have the following properties:
• Consistency: ϕ ∗ψ ∈S(RN).
• Commutativity: ϕ ∗ψ = ψ ∗ϕ.
• Associativity: (ϕ ∗ψ) ∗χ = ϕ ∗(ψ ∗χ).
• Linearity: (αϕ + βψ) ∗χ = αϕ ∗χ + βψ ∗χ for all complex numbers α, β.
The proof of the following theorem can be found in the monograph by H¨ormander
(1983), Vol. 1, Sect. 7.1.

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Theorem 10.13 For the Fourier transform,
F(ϕ ∗ψ) = (2π)N/2(Fϕ)(Fψ).
Conversely, F(ϕψ) = (2π)−N/2(Fϕ) ∗(Fψ).
This theorem tells us that up to a real factor, the Fourier transform sends convo-
lutions to products and, conversely, products to convolutions.
Discussion of terminology.. In order to avoid confusion, the reader should
note that there exist diﬀerent variants of the Fourier transform in the literature.
To discuss this, let us start with the rescaled Fourier transformation formulas
ˆϕ(ξ) =
α
(2π)N/2
Z
RN ϕ(x)e−i⟨x|ξ⟩dNx,
ϕ(x) =
1
α(2π)N/2
Z
RN ˆϕ(ξ)ei⟨x|ξ⟩dNξ.
(10.17)
Here, x = (x1, . . . , xN) and ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξN) lie in RN, and
⟨x|ξ⟩:=
N
X
j=1
xjξj.
(10.18)
The normalization factor α is positive. Setting Fαϕ := ˆϕ, we obtain the following
convolution formulas
Fα(ϕ ∗ψ) = (2π)N/2
α
(Fαϕ)(Fαψ)
(10.19)
and
Fα(ϕψ) =
1
α(2π)N/2 (Fαϕ) ∗(Fαψ).
(10.20)
Note the following.
• The choice α = 1 yields symmetric transformation formulas (10.17) which we
have used in (10.14) above. This is called the Euclidean Fourier transform, since
⟨x|ξ⟩represents the inner product on the N-dimensional Euclidean space RN.
The choice α = 1 has the advantage that the Fourier transform Fϕ := ˆϕ is a
unitary operator F : L2(RN) →L2(RN) on the complex Hilbert space L2(RN).
This is important, since unitary operators between Hilbert spaces preserve the
structure of the corresponding quantum physics.
• However, the choice α = 1 has the disadvantage that there appears an additional
factor in the convolution rule (10.19). To avoid this factor, one has to choose
α = 1/(2π)N/2.
From the physical point of view, the variables x and ξ possess diﬀerent physical
meaning in diﬀerent situations. Let us discuss some typical examples.
(i) The Fourier transform from 1-dimensional position space to 1-dimensional mo-

(iv) The Fourier transform from time space to angular frequency space: Use (10.23)
and set ℏ:= 1 along with E := ω.

Set x := (x0, x1, x2, x3) with x0 := ct, as well as p = (p0, p1, p2, p3) with

This so-called Fourier–Minkowski transform generalizes the Fourier transform
from (ii) and (iii).
(vi) The Fourier–Laplace transform:

(10.25)
Here, the inner product ⟨x|ξ⟩is given by (10.18). The point is that in contrast
to the Fourier transform, the variable ξ does not live in the real space RN, but
in the complex space CN. The Fourier–Laplace transform can be regarded as
an analytic extension of the Fourier transform.
10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a
Paradigm
The Dirichlet principle is an exciting example for a problem that came
from physics and could be solved by mathematics; this famous problem
strongly inﬂuenced the development of far-reaching mathematical theories
in the 20th century.
Folklore
By the Dirichlet principle we understand a method for solving boundary
value problems via minimum problems for variational integrals. This prin-
ciple goes back to Green (1793–1841), Gauss (1777–1855), Lord Kelvin
(1824–1907), and Dirichlet (1805–1859). In 1870 Weierstrass (1815–1897)
was the ﬁrst to underline the shortcomings of this principle. He showed
that there are variational problems which do not have any solution. In 1900
I showed that it is possible to rigorously justify the Dirichlet principle.7
David Hilbert (1862–1943)
In order to understand the great achievement of Hilbert in the ﬁeld of
analysis, it is necessary to ﬁrst comment on the state of analysis at the
end of the nineteenth century. After Weierstrass had made sure of the
foundations of complex function theory, and it has reached an impressive
level, research switched to boundary-value problems, which ﬁrst arose in
7 D. Hilbert, On the Dirichlet principle (in German), Math. Ann. 59 (1904), 161–
186.

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
541
physics (e.g., electrostatics). The work of Riemann (1826–1866) on complex
function theory and conformal maps, however, had shown that boundary-
value problems have great importance for pure mathematics as well. Two
problems had to be solved:
(i) the problem of the existence of an electrostatic potential function for
given boundary values, and
(ii) the problem of eigenoscillations of elastic bodies, for example, string
and membrane.
The state of the theory was bad at the end of the nineteenth century. Rie-
mann had believed that, by using the Dirichlet principle, one could deal
with these problems in a simple and uniform way. After Weierstrass’ sub-
stantial criticism of the Dirichlet principle in 1870, special methods had
to be developed for these problems. These methods, by Carl Neumann,
Amandus Schwarz, and Henri Poincar´e, were very elaborate and still have
great aesthetic appeal today; but because of their variety they were confus-
ing, although at the end of the nineteenth century, Poincar´e (1854–1912),
in particular, endeavored with great astuteness to standardize the theory.
There was, however, a lack of “simple basic facts” from which one could
easily get complete results without sophisticated investigations of limiting
processes.
Hilbert ﬁrst looked for these “simple basic facts” in the calculus of vari-
ations. In 1900 he had an immediate and great success; he succeeded in
justifying the Dirichlet principle.
While Hilbert used variational methods, the Swedish mathematician Fred-
holm (1866–1927) approached the same goal by developing Poincar´e’s work
by using linear integral equations. In the winter semester 1900/01 Holm-
gren, who had come from Uppsala (Sweden) to study under Hilbert in
G¨ottingen (Germany), held a lecture in Hilbert’s seminar on Fredholm’s
work on linear integral equations which had been published the previous
year. This was a decisive day in Hilbert’s life. He took up Fredholm’s dis-
covery with great zeal, and combined it with his variational method. In
this way he succeeded in creating a uniform theory which solved problems
(i) and (ii) above.8
Hilbert believed that with this theory he had provided analysis with a great
general basis which corresponds to an axiomatics of limiting processes. The
further development of mathematics has proved him to be right.9
Otto Blumenthal, 1932
The creation of a rigorous mathematical quantum ﬁeld theory is a challenge for
modern mathematics. There is hope for solving this hard problem in the future. The
optimism is motivated by the success of mathematics in the past. As an example,
let us consider the Dirichlet principle in this section.
Physical motivation. Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open set in R3. We want
to study electric ﬁelds E = −grad U which are generated by a charge density ϱ.
The corresponding Maxwell equation in a vacuum, ε0 div E = ϱ, reads as
ε0∆U = ϱ on Ω,
U = U0 on ∂Ω

Works, Springer, Berlin, 1932, Vol. 3, pp. 388–429.

tration camp Theresienstadt (Tereˇzin).

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
with the Laplacian ∆U := −Uxx −Uyy −Uzz. The boundary-value problem (10.26)
is called the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation. The electric energy in the
region Ωis given by the following integral
E(U) :=
Z
Ω
ε0
2 (U 2
x + U 2
y + U 2
z ) −ϱU dxdydz.
In particular, if ϱ = 0, then E(U) =
ε0
2
R
ΩE2 dxdydz. The principle of minimal
energy reads as
E(U) = min!,
U = U0 on ∂Ω.
(10.27)
We are given the charge density ϱ and the boundary values U0 of the potential U.
We are looking for a potential U such that the electric energy is minimal.
From the physical point of view, it seems to be obvious that there exists a
solution for problem (10.27).
However, from the mathematical point of view, the existence proof is a highly non-
trivial task. In the ﬁrst half of the 19th century, mathematicians and physicists
studied gravitational, electric and magnetic forces in the setting of potential the-
ory.10 Green and Gauss independently published two fundamental papers on the
properties of gravitational and electrostatic forces in 1828 and 1840, respectively.
However, the full understanding of such problems was only completed in the 1960s
on the basis of functional analytic interpolation theory.11 For the history of the
Dirichlet principle, we refer to the following two beautiful articles:

System of units. To simplify notation, in this section we choose a system of
units where the electric ﬁeld constant of the vacuum is equal to one, ε0 = 1.
10.4.1 The Variational Lemma
The space D(Ω) of test functions. For the calculus of variations and the theory
of generalized functions (distributions), it is typical to use test functions. In order
to ﬁx the notation, let Ωbe a nonempty open subset of the N-dimensional space
RN where N = 1, 2, . . .
(i) The space C∞(Ω) of smooth functions: This space consists of all smooth func-
tions f : Ω→C. This means that f is continuous on Ωand has partial
derivatives of arbitrary order which are continuous on Ω, too.

543
(ii) The space D(Ω) of smooth functions which have compact support: By deﬁ-
nition, the smooth function f : Ω→C has compact support iﬀit vanishes
outside a compact subset of Ω. The set of these functions is denoted by the
symbol D(Ω). In other words, we have
f ∈D(Ω)
iﬀf ∈C∞(Ω) and the function f vanishes in some open neighborhood of the
boundary ∂Ω. Intuitively, these test functions do not see the boundary ∂Ω.
(iii) The space C∞(Ω) of functions which are smooth up to the boundary: Recall
that the closure Ωof the set Ωis obtained from Ωby adding the boundary,
Ω= Ω∪∂Ω.
By deﬁnition, the function f : Ω→C lives in the space C∞(Ω) iﬀf ∈C∞(Ω)
and the function f, together with all of its partial derivatives of arbitrary order,
can be continuously extended to the closure Ω.
Obviously, we have the inclusions
D(Ω) ⊆C∞(Ω) ⊆C∞(Ω).
The space D(Ω) was used by Laurent Schwartz in the 1940s in order to introduce the
space D′(Ω) of generalized functions (see Chap. 11). In the literature, one also uses
the symbol C∞
0 (Ω) instead of D(Ω). The following theorem describes the typical
property of test functions.
Theorem 10.14 The set of test functions D(Ω) is dense in the Hilbert space
L2(Ω).
Explicitly, this means the following. For each given function ϕ ∈L2(Ω), there exists
a sequence (ϕn) of test functions, ϕn ∈D(Ω) for all n, such that
lim
n→∞||ϕ −ϕn||2 = lim
n→∞
Z
Ω
|ϕ(x) −ϕn(x)|2dNx = 0.
The proof can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 2.2.3.
The real variational lemma. The following result is crucial for the calculus
of variations (i.e., the principle of critical action in physics).
Proposition 10.15 We are given the continuous function f : Ω→C. Suppose
that
Z
Ω
f(x)h(x)dNx = 0
for all smooth functions h : Ω→R which have compact support. Then, the function
f vanishes on Ω.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that the set Ωis bounded. Choosing h := ℜ(ϕ) and h := ℑ(ϕ),
we get
⟨ϕ|f⟩=
Z
Ω
ϕ(x)†f(x)dNx = 0
for all
ϕ ∈D(Ω).
Let g ∈L2(Ω). By Theorem 10.14, there exists a sequence (ϕn) of test functions
ϕn ∈D(Ω) for all n such that ϕn →g in L2(Ω) as n →∞. It follows from
⟨ϕn|f⟩= 0,
n = 1, 2, . . .

544
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
that ⟨g|f⟩= limn→∞⟨ϕn|f⟩= 0. Choosing g = f, we get f = 0 in L2(Ω). This
tells us that f(x) = 0 for almost all x ∈Ω. Since the function f is continuous, this
implies f(x) = 0 for all x ∈Ω.
If the set Ωis unbounded (e.g. Ω= RN), then we choose an open ball BR of
radius R, and we redeﬁne f(x) := 0 outside BR. Then, the argument above shows
that f = 0 on Ω∩BR. Choosing R = 1, 2, . . ., we obtain that f = 0 on Ω.

The complex variational lemma. Since the ﬁelds arising in quantum physics
are complex-valued, the following variant of the variational lemma is useful for the
principle of critical action.
Proposition 10.16 We are given the continuous functions f, g : Ω→C. Suppose
that
Z
Ω
(f(x)h(x) + g(x)h(x)†)dNx = 0
for all smooth functions h : Ω→C which have compact support. Then the functions
f and g vanish on Ω.
Proof. First let h be real. By the real variational lemma above,
f(x) + g(x) = 0
on Ω.
Secondly, if h(x) := ik(x) where k is real, then f(x) −g(x) = 0 on Ω. This implies
f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0 on Ω.

10.4.2 Integration by Parts
Integration by parts is the key to the calculus of variations and to the
modern theory of linear and nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations.
Folklore
Gauss (1777–1855) had very early been interested in the Laplace equation,
both in two variables in connection with his work on complex numbers,
and in three variables in relation with his astronomical studies. In his 1813
paper on the attraction of spheroids, he had proved particular cases of the
Green formula. After 1830, he devoted much of his time to the study of
magnetism, both experimentally and theoretically, and thus was led to new
research on potential theory which he published in 1839. In that paper, he
quotes no other work on the subject, and it is very unlikely that he ever
heard of Green (1793–1841) whose work was not widely known, even in
England.
Jean Dieudonn´e (1906–1992)

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm

in 1833 the problem of the gravitational potential of ellipsoids of variable
density. In this work Green showed that when the potential U is given on
the boundary of a body, there is just one function that satisﬁes ∆U = 0
throughout the body, has no singularities, and has the given boundary
values. To make his proof, Green assumed the existence of a function that
minimizes the integral
Z
U 2
x + U 2
y + U 2
z dxdydz.
This is the ﬁrst use of the Dirichlet principle. Green’s work strongly in-
spired the great Cambridge school of mathematical physicists which in-
cluded Sir Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903), Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), Lord
Rayleigh (1842–1919), and Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879).

Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times14
The 1-dimensional case. Let −∞< a < b < ∞. Newton (1643–1727) and
Leibniz (1646–1716) discovered the formula
Z b
a
f ′(x)dx = f|b
a
(10.28)
which is called the fundamental theorem of calculus. Here, we set
f|b
a := f(b) −f(a).
The idea is to reduce an integral over the interval Ω:=]a, b[ to an “integral over the
boundary” ∂Ω. For example, formula (10.28) is valid if the function f : [a, b] →R
is smooth up to the boundary. If the functions f, g : [a, b] →R are smooth up to
the boundary, then (fg)′ = f ′g + fg′. By (10.28),
Z b
a
f ′g + fg′ dx = fg|b
a.
This implies the following integration-by-parts formula
Z b
a
f ′gdx = −
Z b
a
fg′dx + fg|b
a.
(10.29)
In particular, the boundary term drops out if the function f has compact support
in the open interval Ω, that is, f ∈D(Ω). Conversely, the integration-by-parts
formula (10.29) implies (10.28) by setting g = 1.
The N-dimensional case. It is our goal to generalize the fundamental theorem
of calculus and hence the integration-by-parts formula to higher dimensions. To
this end, let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of RN with N = 2, 3 . . . Set
x := (x1, . . . , xN) and ∂j :=
∂
∂xj if x ∈RN.
(i) Suppose that f, g : Ω→R are smooth functions where f has compact support.
Then, for j = 1, . . . , N,

(ii) Suppose that the functions f, g : cl(Ω) →R are continuous. In addition, assume
that f and g are smooth on Ω, and their ﬁrst partial derivatives can be extended
to continuous functions on cl(Ω). Furthermore, suppose that the boundary of
Ωis suﬃciently regular (e.g., Ωis a ball or a cuboid). Then, for j = 1, . . . , N,

Here, n(x) = (n1(x), . . . , nN(x)) is the outer unit normal vector at the bound-
ary point x ∈∂Ω, and dS refers to the surface measure.
For the precise formulation one needs the precise deﬁnition of the admissible bound-
aries. We distinguish two cases.
(a) Smooth boundaries: Here, we assume that the closure cl(Ω) = Ω∪∂Ωis a man-
ifold with boundary. Roughly speaking, each boundary point x has a neighbor-
hood in cl (Ω) which, in suitable local coordinates, looks like the suﬃciently
small neighborhood of a boundary point y of the half-space
{(y1, . . . , yN) ∈RN : yN ≥0},
and the change of local coordinates is carried out by diﬀeomorphisms which
are smooth up to the boundary of the half-space. The precise deﬁnition of the
standard term “manifold with boundary” can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol.
4, p. 584. The prototype of a manifold with boundary is a closed ball in RN.
(b) Piecewise smooth boundaries: Note that a cuboid in R3 is not a “manifold with
boundary” because of the corners and edges. However, the integration-by-parts
formula is also valid for cuboids and a general class of bounded open sets in RN
with “piecewise smooth” boundaries (i.e., Lipschitz-continuous boundaries).
The precise formulation of the integration-by-parts formula in this case along
with the proof can be found in J. Neˇcas, Les m´ethodes directes en th´eorie des
equations elliptiques, Academia, Prague, p. 121.
The general Stokes theorem. The integration-by-parts formula dates back
to Lagrange (1736–1813) and Gauss (1777–1855). The formula
Z
Ω
div v d3x =
Z
∂Ω
vn dS
(10.32)
for velocity ﬁelds v is called the Gauss theorem. Here, n denotes the outer unit nor-
mal vector at boundary points. From (10.32) we immediately get the integration-by-
parts formula by choosing v := (fg, 0, 0). Then we obtain div v = fxg + gxf. Green
(1793–1848) based his fundamental 1828 paper, concerning the Green’s function in
potential theory, on the Green’s integral formula

In 1828 the Green’s integral formula (10.33) was obtained independently by
Ostrogradski (1801–1862).

in 1854. Here, N denotes the unit normal vector of the surface S in R3, and the
boundary curve ∂S is counterclockwise oriented with respect to N. For a region in
the Euclidean plane, the Stokes formula (10.34) coincides with the 2-dimensional
version of the Gauss formula (10.32). The modern variant of the Gauss formula
(10.32) and the Stokes formula (10.34), basically due to Poincar´e (1854–1912),
reads elegantly as

(10.35)
Here, ω is a smooth (N −1)-dimensional diﬀerential form on the N-dimensional
manifold M with boundary. For the proof of the general Stokes theorem (10.34)
and its numerous applications, we refer to the following monographs:

Springer, New York, 1982.
In Volume III on gauge ﬁeld theory, we will show that the formula (10.35) is crucial
for understanding the topological structure of general potentials in physics, and it
lies at the heart of cohomology theory which is crucial for modern topology and
quantum ﬁeld theory.
The general Stokes theorem is one of the most beautiful and most useful
theorems in mathematics and physics.
10.4.3 The Variational Problem
One needs to have delved but little into the principles of diﬀerential cal-
culus to know the method of how to determine the greatest and least
ordinates of curves. But there are maxima or minima problems of a higher
order, which in fact depend on the same method, which however can not
be subjected to this method. These are the problems where it is a matter
of ﬁnding the curves themselves.
The ﬁrst problem of this type, which the geometers solved, is that of the
brachistochrone or the curve of fastest fall, which Johann Bernoulli (1667–
1748) proposed toward the end of the preceding century. One attained this
only in special ways, and it was only some time later and on the occasion of
the investigations concerning isoperimetric problems that the geometer of
whom we just spoke and his excellent brother Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705)
gave some rules in order to solve several other problems of this type.
But since these rules were not of suﬃcient generality, the famous Euler
(1707–1783) undertook in 1744 to refer all investigations of this type to
a general method. But even as sophisticated and fruitful as his method
is, one must nevertheless confess that it is not suﬃciently simple. . . Now,
here one ﬁnds a method which requires only a simple use of the principles
of diﬀerential and integral calculus.

Euler in a letter to Lagrange
The Euler–Lagrange equation. Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open set in R2.
We are given the continuous function ϱ : Ω→R and the continuous boundary
function U0 : ∂Ω→R.16
Theorem 10.17 Each smooth solution U : Ω→R of the variational problem
Z
Ω
1
2(U 2
x + U 2
y ) −ϱU dxdy = min!
(10.36)
with the boundary condition U = U0 on ∂Ωsatisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
−Uxx −Uyy = ϱ
on
Ω
which is called the Euler–Lagrange equation to (10.36).
The following elegant proof is identical with Lagrange’s classical argument.
Proof. Let U ∈C∞(Ω) be a solution of the minimum problem. Choose a smooth
test function h : Ω→R which has compact support. Replacing U by U + τh, we
get
J (τ) :=
Z
Ω
1
2(Ux + τhx)2 + 1
2(Uy + τhy)2 −ϱ(U + τh) dxdy,
τ ∈R.
The test function h vanishes on the boundary ∂Ω. Therefore, the function U + τh
has the same boundary values on ∂Ωas the function U. Since U is a solution of
the minimum problem (10.36), the function τ →J (τ) has a minimum at the point
τ = 0. This implies that the derivative of the real function J vanishes at the point
τ = 0, that is, J ′(0) = 0. Hence
Z
Ω
Uxhx + Uyhy −ϱh dxdy = 0.
Integration by parts yields
Z
Ω
(−Uxx −Uyy −ϱ)h dxdy = 0
for all test functions h. By the variational lemma, −Uxx −Uyy −ϱ = 0 on Ω.
2
Many important variational problems related to the principle of critical action in
physics can be found in the problem section to Chap. 14 on page 805.
16 Recall that the symbol Ωdenotes the closure of the set Ω. The closure is also
denoted by cl(Ω).

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
549
10.4.4 Weierstrass’ Counterexample
Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) studied law in Bonn. In 1839 he decided
to study mathematics and therefore went to M¨unster, where he attended
a mathematical lecture by Gudermann (1798–1852) on elliptic functions.
This was the only mathematical lecture which he ever heard in his life.
After that Weierstrass worked from 1840 until 1855 as schoolteacher, to-
tally isolated, in small towns. During this time he published a series of
fundamental papers on the most diﬃcult problems of complex function
theory.17
In his academic inaugural speech in 1857 as a newly elected member of
the Berlin Academy, he described how the theory of elliptic functions had
tremendously attracted him, even before his studies, and that he regarded
it as one of the main tasks of mathematics to create a general theory on
periodic functions of several complex variables (Abelian functions).
To prepare himself for this diﬃcult task, he ﬁrst studied the available
tools and occupied himself with less diﬃcult problems. As a result of these
studies he published, during the years 1841–1843, papers on the theory
of power series and on the deﬁnition of analytic functions by means of
algebraic diﬀerential equations.
In 1854 Weierstrass ﬁrst succeeded in ﬁnding the solution to the famous
“inverse problem” posed by Jacobi (1804–1851) in 1832.18 The generaliza-
tion of this result to general Abelian integrals, which was later obtained
by Riemann and then by Weierstrass, is one of the greatest achievements
in analysis. Whereas Riemann based his theory on the imperfect Dirichlet
principle, Weierstrass’ theory is based on purely algebraic arguments.
From Hilbert’s obituary for Weierstrass
Riemann (1826–1866) is the man with glowing intuition. Through his over-
all genius he stands far above all his peers. Everywhere that his interest
was aroused, he started the theory from scratch without worrying about
tradition or constraints of existing systems.
Weierstrass (1815–1897) was above all a logician; he works slowly, system-
atically, step by step. Where he works, he heads for a ﬁnished form of the
theory.
Without new ideas and without the formulation of new objectives, mathe-
matics would soon amount to nothing more than the rigidity of its proofs
and would begin to stagnate, its fuel running out. So, in a certain sense,
17 In 1864 Weierstrass became professor in mathematics at the Berlin University.
18 Jacobi formulated the following hypothesis: Let p = p(z) be a polynomial of
degree six. Consider the two functions u = u(a, b) and v = v(a, b) of the two
complex arguments a, b given by the following system of hyperelliptic integrals
Z u
u0
dz
p
p(z)
+
Z v
v0
dz
p
p(z)
= a,
Z u
u1
dz
p
p(z)
+
Z v
v1
dz
p
p(z)
= b.
Then the two functions u+v and uv are univalent and they possess four diﬀerent
periods.

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
mathematics has been furthered most by those who distinguished them-
selves more through their intuition than through strong deduction.19
Felix Klein (1849–1925)
Riemann’s argument. Riemann based his seminal approach to complex function
theory (e.g., the Riemann mapping theorem) and to Abelian integrals on both the
notion of Riemann surface and on the following boundary-value problem for the
Laplace equation20
∆U = 0 on Ω,
U = U0 on ∂Ω
(10.37)
where Ωis a bounded region in R2. According to the Dirichlet principle, Riemann
reduced the boundary-value problem (10.37) to the following minimum problem
Z
Ω
U 2
x + U 2
y dxdy = min!,
U = U0 on ∂Ω.
(10.38)
He followed the opinion of his contemporaries that the existence of a solution for
(10.37) is evident, by physics. In fact, if we set E = −grad U, then problem (10.38)
concerns the determination of an electrostatic ﬁeld E of minimal energy under given
boundary values of the potential U. By physical intuition, such a ﬁeld always exists.
The counterexample. Let C1[−1, 1] be the space of all continuous functions
f : [−1, 1] →R which have a continuous ﬁrst derivative f ′ on the open interval
]−1, 1[, such that f ′ can be extended to a continuous function on the closed interval
[−1, 1]. In 1870 Weierstrass published the following variational problem
E(f) : =
Z 1
−1
(xf ′(x))2dx = min!, f ∈C1[−1, 1],
f(−1) = 1, f(1) = 0.
(10.39)
Obviously, E(f) ≥0 for all f ∈C1[−1, 1]. Choose
fn(x) := 1
2 −1
2 · arctan nx
arctan n ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Then, fn(−1) = 1 and fn(1) = 0 for all n. Moreover, limn→∞E(fn) = 0. Conse-
quently, we have
inf E(f) = 0
where the inﬁmum is taken over all admissible functions f ∈C1[−1, 1] which satisfy
the boundary conditions f(−1) = 1 and f(1) = 0.
Proposition 10.18 Problem (10.39) has no solution.

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
551
Proof. Suppose that f is a solution. Then E(f) = 0. This implies that xf ′(x) = 0
for all x ∈[−1, 1]. Hence f ′(x) = 0 for all x ∈[−1, 1] with x ̸= 0. Since f is
continuous on [−1, 1], we get f(x) = const for all x ∈[−1, 1]. This implies the
relation f(−1) = f(1), which contradicts the boundary condition f(−1) = 1 and
f(1) = 0.
2
If we replace the boundary condition from (10.39) by f(−1) = f(1) = 0, then
the modiﬁed problem has a solution, namely, f = 0.
The idea of completion. Let X be the set of all rational numbers living in
the interval [0, 2]. For the two minimum problems
f(x) = min!,
x ∈[0, 2],
(10.40)
and
f(x) = min!,
x ∈X,
(10.41)
the following two statements can be proved.
(i) The Weierstrass theorem: If f : [0, 2] →R is continuous, then problem (10.40)
has a solution.
(ii) If f : X →R is continuous, then problem (10.41) does not always have a
solution.
To prove (ii), choose f(x) := (x −
√
2)2. Problem (10.40) then has the unique
solution x =
√
2. Since this is an irrational number,
√
2 is not contained in the
set X. Therefore, problem (10.41) has no solution. If a mathematician knew only
rational numbers, but not irrational numbers, then he could not prove a general
existence theorem about minimal problems of the type (10.41). But if, one day, our
mathematician invented irrational numbers, thereby completing the set of rational
numbers Q to the set of real numbers R, then he could prove a general existence
theorem for problem (10.40). For the Dirichlet principle, we will encounter the same
situation in Sect. 10.4.6 on page 555 by using the following replacements:
• rational numbers ⇒smooth functions;
• irrational numbers ⇒distributions;
• completion of the set of rational numbers to the set of real numbers
⇒completion of the space of smooth functions to Sobolev spaces.
It is a general strategy of mathematics to simplify the solution of important prob-
lems by introducing ideal objects.
Weyl’s elegant presentation of Riemann’s theory. As a highlight in com-
plex analysis, the young Hermann Weyl (1885–1955) wrote a famous monograph
on Riemann’s theory:
H. Weyl, Die Idee der Riemannschen Fl¨ache (The concept of a Riemann
surface), Teubner, Leipzig, 1913 (in German).21
Recall that, by deﬁnition, a Riemann surface is a connected 2-dimensional complex
manifold.22 This means that the change of local coordinates is given by diﬀeomor-
phisms χ, that is, the bijective map χ and its inverse map χ−1 are holomorphic
functions with respect to local coordinates. We call such functions biholomorphic.
Two Riemann surfaces X and Y are called conformally equivalent iﬀthere exists a
biholomorphic map
f : X →Y,
21 A new edition of this classic with commentaries has been published in 1997.
22 Naturally enough, we exclude the trivial case where the manifold is empty.

552
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
that is, this map is bijective and both f and f −1 are holomorphic functions with
respect to local coordinates. The following theorems are basic for the theory of
Riemann surfaces:
(i) The Riemann mapping theorem:
Each nonempty, simply connected, open subset of the complex plane
which diﬀers from the plane is conformally equivalent to the open unit
disc.
An elegant proof of this theorem can be found in Remmert (1998), Sect. 8.2.
(ii) The uniformization theorem for simply connected Riemann surfaces:
Each simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to
one and only one of the following three normal forms: the open unit
disc, the complex plane, the Riemann sphere.
The proof can be found in Farkas and Kra (1992), Sect. 4.4. .
(iii) The uniformization theorem for compact Riemann surfaces: The classiﬁcation
of compact Riemann surfaces via conformal equivalence is crucial for string
theory.
The equivalence classes of compact Riemann surfaces with ﬁxed genus
g = 0, 1, 2, . . . form Riemann’s moduli space Mg of complex dimension
0, 1, 3g −3 if g = 0, 1, g ≥2, respectively.
The moduli spaces Mg are closely related to Teichm¨uller spaces. We will study
this in Volume VI. As an introduction to the theory of compact Riemann
surfaces, we recommend the Lecture Notes by Jost (1997). This monograph is
based on harmonic maps which are related to a generalization of the Dirichlet
principle to mappings between manifolds.
10.4.5 Typical Diﬃculties
We want to explain why the notion of classical solution fails for the Dirichlet prin-
ciple in reasonable situations.

refers to a curve of minimal length between the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). The
calculus of variations was founded by Euler (1707–1783) in his famous 1744 paper.
In 1779 Euler discovered that for appropriate boundary points, the solution of
(10.42) is only a polygon, but not a smooth curve. Euler called this the paradox of
the calculus of variations. It seems that Euler’s paradox was not known to the great
masters of mathematics in the ﬁrst half of the 19th century. In 1871 there appeared
the paper by L. Todhunter, Researches in the calculus of variations, principally of
discontinuous solutions, MacMillan, London.
The microstructure of materials and random ground states. Consider
the variational problem
E(u) :=

(u′(x)2 −1)dx = min!, u ∈C1[0, 1]
(10.43)
along with the boundary condition u(0) = u(1) = 0.

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
553
Proposition 10.19 This minimum problem has no solution.
Proof. The idea is to use an equipartition of the interval [0, 1] of mesh size ∆x
and piecewise linear continuous functions p : [0, 1] →R which attain the derivatives
p′(x) = ±1 outside the grid points. Smoothing these zig-zag functions a little bit
and letting ∆x →0, we get a sequence (un) of admissible functions such that
E(un) →0 as n →∞. Hence inf E(u) = 0 where the inﬁmum is taken over all
admissible functions.
Suppose now that u is a solution of the minimum problem. Then E(u) = 0.
Hence u′(x) = ±1 for all x ∈[0, 1]. By continuity, either u′(x) = 1 on [0, 1] or
u′(x) = −1 on [0, 1]. But this contradicts u(0) = u(1) = 0.
2
In terms of physics, problem (10.43) represents an oversimpliﬁed model of some
material which has the energy E(u) in the state u. Proposition 10.19 tells us that
there is no state of minimal energy, but only a sequence of states (i.e., zig-zag
functions with ∆x →0) which approach the inﬁmum of possible energies.
Therefore, it is meaningful to say that the generalized solution of problem
(10.43) is a random distribution of states where the derivatives +1 and −1
are attained with probability 1
2.
This situation is well-known in the modern mathematical theory for materials
equipped with microstructure. As an introduction into this new branch of anal-
ysis, we recommend the Lecture Notes by M¨uller (1999) (variational models for
microstructure and phase transitions) and Dolzmann (2003) (variational methods
for crystalline microstructure: analysis and computation).
Lack of smoothness of the ground state. The minimum problem
E(u) :=
Z 1
−1
u(x)2(2x −u′(x))2dx = min!, u ∈C1[−1, 1]
with the boundary condition u(−1) = 0, u(1) = 1 has the unique solution
u0(x) := 0 on [−1, 0],
u0(x) := x2 on ]0, 1].
The second derivative of this solution jumps at the point x = 0.
Proof. (I) Existence. Obviously, E(u0) = 0. Since E(u) ≥0 for all admissible
functions u, the function u0 is a solution.
(II) Uniqueness. Let v be a solution. Then E(v) = 0. Consequently, we obtain
v(x)2(2x −v′(x))2 = 0 for all x ∈[−1, 1]. Hence
v′(x) = 2x
or
v(x) = 0
for all
x ∈[−1, 1]
along with v(−1) = 0 and v(1) = 1. At the point x = 1, the boundary condition
v(1) = 1 implies v′(x) = 2x near x = 1. Let ]a, 1] be the largest subinterval of
[0, 1] such that v(x) ̸= 0. Then v′(x) = 2x on ]a, 1]. Hence v(x) = x2 on ]a, 1].
This implies a = 0. Similarly, we start at the boundary point x = −1 in order to
conclude that v(x) = 0 on [−1, 0]. Thus, v = u0.

This counterexample due to Hadamard (1865–1963) tells us that the solution of
the boundary-value problem (10.44) cannot be obtained by solving the variational
problem of minimal energy.
In other words, the Dirichlet principle fails completely for the special
boundary values g0 on the unit circle.
H¨older spaces. Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open set in RN with dimension
N = 1, 2, . . . . Fix the number α ∈]0, 1[. We say that the function f : Ω→R is
H¨older continuous with exponent α iﬀthe following supremum
Hα(f) :=
sup
x,y∈Ω,x̸=y
|f(x) −f(y)|
||x −y||α
is ﬁnite. We write f ∈Cα(Ω). This implies that
|f(x) −f(y)| ≤Hα(f)||x −y||α
for all
x, y ∈Ω.
(10.45)
Note that the given function f can be uniquely extended to a continuous function
f : cl(Ω) →R on the closure of Ω, and the inequality (10.45) remains valid for all
x, y ∈cl(Ω).
• The H¨older space Cα(Ω) becomes a real Banach space equipped with the norm
||f||α :=
max
x∈cl(Ω) |f(x)| + Hα(f).
• Let k = 1, 2, . . . The H¨older space Ck,α(Ω) consists of all the functions f ∈Cα(Ω)
whose partial derivatives up to order k lie in Cα(Ω). These partial derivatives
on Ωcan then be continuously extended to the closure cl(Ω). Equipped with the
norm
||f||k,α :=

the space Ck,α(Ω) becomes a real Banach space.
Lipschitz spaces. The function F : Ω→R is called Lipschitz continuous iﬀ
condition (10.45) is satisﬁed with α = 1. The set of all these functions is denoted
by C0,1(Ω). This is a real Banach space equipped with the norm
||f||0,1 := max
x∈cl(Ω) |f(x)| + H1(f).
Setting k = 1, 2, . . . and α = 1, we get the real Banach space Ck,1(Ω) as above.

If f ∈C0,1(Ω), then the function f is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere on
the set Ω.
Lack of smoothness of the Newtonian potential. Let Ωbe an open ball
in R3. The Newtonian potential
U(x) :=
Z
Ω
ϱ(y)d3y
4π||x −y||
(10.46)
describes the electrostatic potential generated by the charge density ϱ. The corre-
sponding electric ﬁeld is given by E := −grad U. The Newtonian potential is also
called volume potential.
(i) If the charge density ϱ : cl(Ω) →R is continuous, then the Newtonian potential
U is continuous and has continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives on the total space
R3. Hence the electric ﬁeld E is continuous on R3.
(ii) If ϱ : cl(Ω) →R is continuous, then it is not always true that the Newtonian
potential U has partial derivatives of second order on Ω. This means that the
electric ﬁeld E = −grad U is not always diﬀerentiable on the ball Ω.
(iii) However, if ϱ is H¨older continuous, that is, ϱ ∈Cα(Ω) with 0 < α < 1, and
if ϱ vanishes in an open neighborhood of the boundary of the ball Ω, then we
have U ∈C2,α(Ω) along with ∆U = ϱ on Ω.
For the proof of (i) and (iii), see Jost (2000b), p. 256. The classical counterexample
to (ii) is given by
ϱ(x) :=
„3z2
r2 −1
«

ln r
with r := ||x||. This is studied in the monograph by G¨unter (1957), Sect. 2.14. The
classical result (iii) was ﬁrst obtained by Otto H¨older (1859–1937) in his dissertation
at the University of T¨ubingen (Germany) in 1882. For further material, we refer to
the treatise on the calculus of variations by Giaquinta and Hildebrandt (1995).
Summarizing, the solvability theory for variational problems is complicated,
since there exist strange states in nature (e.g., discontinuous microstruc-
tures or concentrations of energy described by inﬁnities of energy.)
Similarly, the mathematical diﬃculties arising in quantum ﬁeld theory are caused
by the complexity of the fundamental interactions in nature. To overcome the math-
ematical diﬃculties, it is necessary to develop the right mathematical tools. Con-
cerning the Dirichlet principle, mathematics was successful in the 20th century in
the framework of functional analysis (Hilbert’s axiomatics of limiting processes). In
what follows we shall discuss the basic ideas.
Historical remark. In 1782 Laplace (1749–1827) remarked in a study on the
shape of the planets that the Newtonian potential (10.46) satisﬁes the equation
∆U = 0 outside the region Ωof the planet. Interestingly enough, Laplace found
this equation in the complex form of spherical coordinates. Five years later, Laplace
discovered the simpler expression in Cartesian coordinates, ∆U = Uxx + Uyy + Uzz.
In 1813 Poisson (1781–1840) found that for a ball Ωwith constant mass density,
there holds −∆U = ϱ on Ωwhich is now called the Poisson equation. Observe that
in modern diﬀerential geometry, the sign of ∆has been changed in order to obtain
an operator with positive eigenvalues of ∆. We follow this sign change.
10.4.6 The Functional Analytic Existence Theorem
The role of functional analysis has been decisive exactly in connection
with classical problems. Almost all problems are on the applications, where

lytical tasks and organize material in a clear and transparent form so that
you know what the diﬃculties are.

The generalized Dirichlet principle. Let Ωbe a nonempty open bounded subset

(10.48)
We are given the functions ϱ, U0 : Ω→R such that we have ϱ ∈L2(Ω) and
U0 ∈W 1
2 (Ω).
Theorem 10.20 The minimum problem (10.47) has a unique solution U. This
function satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential equation (10.48) in the sense of distribu-
tions.
If the boundary is smooth, that is, the closure cl(Ω) is a manifold with boundary,
then the solution U lies in the Sobolev space W 2
2 (Ω). The solution only depends on
the generalized boundary values of the given function U0
Roughly speaking, the solutions gain regularity if the boundary of the set Ωgains
regularity (e.g., Ωis a ball).
Basic notions. Let us explain the terminology used above. We will apply the
language of distributions to be introduced in Sect. 11.3 on page 607. As above, let
Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of RN.
(i) The Schwartz space D(Ω) of test functions: Recall that this space consists of
all smooth functions ϕ : Ω→R which vanish outside a compact subset of Ω.
In particular, we have
ϕ = 0 on ∂Ω.
(10.49)
This boundary condition will be generalized below.
(ii) Distributions: Each function U : Ω→R with U ∈L2(Ω) represents a distri-
bution, that is, U ∈D′(Ω).
Therefore, the function U has partial derivatives of all orders.
This is the decisive advantage of the theory of distributions. In particular, the
symbols ∂jU, j = 1, 2, . . . , and ∆U are well-deﬁned. If U, fj ∈L2(Ω), then the
equation ∂jU = fj is equivalent to

In the special case where f, fj, U, ϱ are smooth functions, formulas (10.50) and
(10.51) coincide with the classical integration-by-parts formulas.
(iii) The Sobolev space W 1

U : Ω→R with U, ∂1U, . . . , ∂NU ∈L2(Ω). The space W 1

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
(ix) Generalized boundary values: Suppose that the behavior of the closure cl(Ω)
is suﬃciently regular near the boundary. More precisely, we assume that cl(Ω)
is a manifold with boundary (e.g., a ball). The classical boundary operator
B : C(Ω) →C(∂Ω)
maps the continuous function U : cl(Ω) →R to its boundary values BU :
∂Ω→R. This map can be uniquely extended to a linear continuous operator
B : W 1
2 (Ω) →L2(∂Ω).
(10.52)
We call the function BU in L2(∂Ω) the generalized boundary values of the
function U ∈W 1
2 (Ω). Naturally enough, if U ∈
◦
W 1
2 (Ω), then BU = 0, that
is, U = 0 on ∂Ωin the generalized sense. Observe that the boundary operator
from (10.52) is not surjective. This means that there are boundary functions
g : ∂Ω→R with
R
∂Ωg2dS < ∞such that g is not the generalized boundary
value of a function U : Ω→R which lies in W 1
2 (Ω). However, the boundary
operator
B : W 1
2 (Ω) →W 1/2
2
(∂Ω)
is surjective, linear, and continuous. Observe that the fractional Sobolev space
W 1/2
2
(∂Ω) is deﬁned similarly to W 1/2
2
(Ω) above, by using a decomposition of
the boundary ∂Ωalong with local coordinates.
10.4.7 Regularity of the Solution
We want to show that the generalized solution U from Theorem 10.20 is indeed
a classical smooth solution if the given data (i.e., density ϱ, boundary ∂Ω, and
boundary values U0) are smooth.
The Sobolev embedding theorem. As above, let Ωbe a nonempty bounded
open subset of RN with N = 1, 2, . . . such that the closure cl(Ω) is a manifold with
boundary. If k is an integer with k > N/2, then the embedding
W k
2 (Ω) ⊆C(Ω)
is continuous. Explicitly this means that if U ∈W k
2 (Ω), then there exists a uniquely
determined continuous function V : cl(Ω) →R such that
U(x) = V (x)
for almost all x ∈Ω.
Moreover, if we have the convergence Un →U in W k
2 (Ω) as n →∞, then we get
the convergence Vn →V in C(Ω) for the corresponding continuous functions. In
the special case where N = 1 (resp. N = 2, 3), we need k ≥1 (resp. k ≥2). This
implies the following crucial theorem:
If U ∈W k
2 (Ω), k = 1, 2, . . . , then U ∈C∞(Ω),
after changing the values of U on a set of N-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero, if
necessary.27 In particular, in order to get smooth solutions of the Dirichlet problem,
27 The proof of the Sobolev embedding theorem can be found in Evans (1998),
p. 270. There, one also ﬁnds stronger results. For example, if N = 3, then the
embedding W 2
2 (Ω) ⊆C1/2(Ω) is continuous. The simple proof for a prototype
of the Sobolev embedding theorem will be given in Problem 10.3 based on the
fundamental theorem of calculus.

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
559
one has to show that the solution U from Theorem 10.20 lies in all the Sobolev
spaces W k
2 (Ω) with k = 1, 2, . . . This is the basic idea of regularity proofs in the
modern theory of partial diﬀerential equations.
Smooth solutions of the Dirichlet problem. Consider the classical bound-
ary value problem
∆U = ϱ on Ω,
U = U0 on ∂Ω.
(10.53)
The corresponding electrostatic energy reads as
E(U) =
Z
Ω
(
N
X
j=1
1
2(∂jU)2 −ϱU) dNx.
Let us make the following assumptions.
(A1) Smooth boundary: Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of RN with
N = 2, 3, . . . such that the closure cl(Ω) is a manifold with boundary (e.g., a
ball).
(A2) Smooth charge density function: We are given the function ϱ ∈C∞(Ω).
(A3) Smooth boundary values of the electrostatic potential: The given boundary
function U0 : ∂Ω→R is smooth (with respect to local coordinates of the
boundary manifold ∂Ω).
Theorem 10.21 The boundary-value problem (10.53) has a unique real solution
U ∈C∞(Ω). The function U is also the unique solution of the variational problem
E(U) = min!,
U ∈C∞(Ω),
U = U0 on ∂Ω.
More generally, the classical solution U from Theorem 10.21 coincides with the
generalized solution from Theorem 10.20. The proof can be found in Jost (2000b),
p. 226.
The extension of the classical Laplacian for zero boundary values. It
is convenient to reformulate the concept of generalized solution in the language of
operator theory in Hilbert spaces. Let us ﬁrst consider the homogeneous boundary
value problem
∆U = ϱ on Ω,
U = 0 on ∂Ω.
(10.54)
We start with the classical Laplacian
∆: D(Ω) →D(Ω)
(10.55)
given by ∆U = ϱ. Our goal is to construct function spaces X and Y such that there
exists an extension
∆: X →Y
of the Laplacian from (10.55) where the extended operator is a linear homeomor-
phism from X onto Y . Then there exists the linear continuous operator
∆−1 : Y →X.
This means that equation (10.54) has the unique solution U = ∆−1ϱ, and this
solution depends continuously on the charge density ϱ. The proof of Theorem 10.20
shows that one can choose the Sobolev spaces

and

(Ω).
The extension of the classical Laplacian for nonzero boundary values.
We now consider the more general inhomogeneous boundary-value problem
∆U = ϱ on Ω,
U = U0 on ∂Ω.
(10.56)
We assume that Ωis a nonempty bounded open set in RN such that cl(Ω) is a
manifold with boundary. Let us start with the classical operator
∆: C∞(Ω) →C∞(Ω) × C∞(∂Ω)
given by ∆U := (ϱ, U0). This operator can be uniquely extended to a linear home-
omorphism
∆: X →Y × Z
if we choose the following spaces.
(i) H¨older spaces: X = C2,α(Ω), Y = Cα(Ω), Z = C2,α(∂Ω).28
(ii) Sobolev spaces: X = W 2
2 (Ω), Y = L2(Ω), Z = W 3/2

(∂Ω).
The extension of linear diﬀerential operators in Hilbert spaces was ﬁrst studied by
Friedrichs (1901–1982) in the 1930s, by applying von Neumann’s spectral theory
for unbounded self-adjoint operators. The theory of the Friedrichs extension and
important applications to the partial diﬀerential equations of mathematical physics
can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Chap. 5.
Interpolation theory. In order to get operators of the form X, Y, Z above
in a systematic way, interpolation theory was developed in the 1960s. The most
important function spaces are the Besov spaces Bs
pq(Ω) and the Triebel–Lizorkin
spaces F s
pq(Ω). As special cases, we mention
Bk+α
∞,∞(Ω) = Ck,α(Ω),
F k
22(Ω) = W k
2 (Ω),
k = 0, 1, . . . , 0 < α < 1
and F 1/2
22 (Ω) = W 1/2
2
(Ω). Here, Ck,α(Ω) := Cα(Ω) and W k
2 (Ω) := L2(Ω) if k = 0.
As an elementary introduction to this subject, we recommend Zeidler (1995), Vol.
2, p. 360ﬀand Reed and Simon (1972), Vol. 2, Sect. IX.4 (interpolation theory in
Banach spaces). Much material can be found in Triebel, Theory of Function Spaces,
Birkh¨auser, Basel, 1992.
10.4.8 The Beauty of the Green’s Function
The Green’s function allows us to reduce the solution of general boundary
values to the solution of a special boundary value problem.

28 This approach was developed by Schauder (1899–1943) in the 1930s. A modern
version of the Schauder theory based on sophisticated a priori estimates can be
found in Jost (2002b).

Here, meas(SN−1) is the surface measure of the unit sphere in RN. Explicitly,
meas(S2M−1) =

(M −1)!,
meas(S2M) = 22M+1M! πM
(2M)!
,
M = 1, 2, . . .
In terms of physics, for N = 3, the function
Ux0(x) =
Q
4π ||x −x0||
is the electrostatic potential of the charge Q located at the point x0, along with the
electric ﬁeld E = −grad Ux0.
Proposition 10.22 For all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN) with N = 2, 3, . . .,
Z
Ω
Ux0(x)∆ϕ(x) dNx = Qϕ(x0).
The proof will be given in Problem 10.4. Let us translate this into the modern
language of distributions to be introduced in Sect. 12.6.1 on page 730. To this end,
for all ϕ ∈D(RN), we deﬁne the following notions.
• Dirac’s delta distribution: δx0(ϕ) := ϕ(x0);
• electrostatic potential as generalized function (distribution):
Ux0(ϕ) :=
Z
RN Ux0(x)ϕ(x) dNx;
• derivative ∂jUx0(ϕ) = −Ux0(∂jϕ), j = 1, . . . , N;
• Laplacian: ∆Ux0(ϕ) = Ux0(∆ϕ).
Therefore, it follows from Prop. 10.22 that
∆Ux0 = Qδx0.
(10.57)
The existence-and uniqueness theorem for the Green’s function. Let
Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of RN with N = 2, 3, . . . such that the
closure cl(Ω) is a manifold with boundary. Fix the point x0 ∈Ω, and consider the
following boundary-value problem:
∆Wx0 = 0 on Ω,
Wx0 = −Ux0 on ∂Ω.
(10.58)
The following theorem is a special case of Theorem 10.21.
Theorem 10.23 The boundary-value problem (10.58) has precisely one classical
solution Wx0 ∈C∞(Ω).
Using the function Wx0, we deﬁne the function
G(x, x0) := Ux0(x) + Wx0(x)
for all
x ∈Ω\ {x0}
which is called the Green’s function of the Poisson equation on the set Ω. We set
Gx0(x) := G(x, x0). By (10.57),
∆Gx0 = Qδx0 on Ω,
Gx0 = 0 on ∂Ω.
(10.59)
It turns out that G is symmetric, that is, G(x, x0) = G(x0, x) for all x, x0 ∈Ωwith
x ̸= x0.
The magic Green’s solution formula. In his 1828 paper, Green underlined
the importance of the following formula.

562
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Theorem 10.24 The solution U from Theorem 10.21 can be represented by the
magic Green formula
U(x0) =
Z
Ω
G(x, x0)ϱ(x) dNx −
Z
∂Ω
∂G(x, x0)
∂nx
U0(x) dS
where
∂
∂nx denotes the directional derivative with respect to the outer normal vector
at the boundary point x.
This is the prototype of representation formulas for the solutions of partial diﬀeren-
tial equations by using integral kernels. This formula shows how the charge density
and the boundary values inﬂuence the electrostatic potential U. For example, if the
charge density ϱ is only concentrated near the point x1 and the boundary values
of the potential are only concentrated near the point x2, then the solution looks
approximately like
U(x0) = G(x1, x0)ϱ(x1)(∆x)3 −∂G(x2, x0)
∂nx2
U0(x2)∆S.
Therefore, the Green’s function localizes physical eﬀects. This fact is crucial for
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Proof. Let BR be an open ball of suﬃciently small radius R centered at the point
x0. By Green’s formula (10.33) on page 546,

This formula can be simpliﬁed by observing the following.
• ∆Gx0 = 0 on Ω\ BR.
• Gx0 = 0 on ∂Ω.
• ∆U = ϱ on Ω.
Finally, let R →0 and observe the Green lemma proved in Problem 10.5.

The Green’s function for the unit ball. Let B be the open unit ball in
R3. In this case, the Green’s function for the Poisson equation is explicitly known,
namely, if x0 ∈B \ {0}, then
G(x, x0) :=
Q
4π||x −x0|| −
Q∗
4π||x −x∗
0||
for all
x ∈B \ {x0}.
Here, the point x∗
0 is obtained from x0 by inversion with respect to the unit sphere.
Explicitly,
x∗
0 :=
1
||x0|| ·
x0
||x0||
for all
x0 ∈B \ {0}.
Moreover, we choose the charges Q := 1 and Q∗:= Q||x∗
0||/||x0||. The conformal
map x0 →x∗
0 is called Kelvin transformation.. If x0 = 0, then we set
G(x, 0) :=
1
4π||x|| −1
4π
for all
x ∈B \ {0}.
In terms of physics, the Green’s function allows the following interpretation. Note
that in a metallic electric conductor, the electrostatic potential vanishes. Now con-
sider a metallic unit sphere which bounds the open unit ball B. Put an electric
charge at the point x0. The Green’s function x →G(x, x0) is then the corre-
sponding electrostatic potential. In fact, as the superposition of two potentials, the

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
563
function x →G(x, x0) satisﬁes the Laplace equation outside both the point x0 and
the mirror point x∗
0. Furthermore, we have chosen the point x∗
0 in such a way that
G(x, x0) = 0 on the unit sphere ∂B. In fact, if ||x|| = 1, then
||x −x∗
0||2
||x −x0||2 = 1 −xx∗
0 + ||x∗
0||2
1 −xx0 + ||x0||2 .
Set r := ||x0|| and r∗:= ||x∗

By Theorem 10.24, this is the unique solution of the boundary-value problem
∆U = 0 on B,

if the given boundary function U0 is smooth. The following classical proposition
shows that the continuity of the boundary function is suﬃcient.
Proposition 10.25 If the given boundary function U0 : ∂B →R is continuous,
then the Poisson formula (10.60) yields the unique solution of the Dirichlet problem
(10.61) which is smooth on the open ball B and can be continuously extended to the
closed unit ball cl(B).

The elegant formal language of physicists. In the late 1920s, Dirac refor-
mulated the classical 1828 approach due to Green by introducing the Dirac delta

Formal application of the variational lemma yields ∆Ux0(x) = Qδ(x −x0) on the
set Ω. Thus, for each ﬁxed x0 ∈Ω,
∆G(x, x0) = Qδ(x −x0) on Ω,
G(x, x0) = 0 on ∂Ω.

This equation is used by physicists in order to characterize the Green’s function
of the Poisson equation on Ω. Equations (10.62) and (10.59) reﬂect the diﬀerence
between the language of physicists and mathematicians, respectively.

10.4.9 The Method of Orthogonal Projection
I am convinced that it will be possible to get these existence proofs by a
general basic idea towards which the Dirichlet principle points. Perhaps it
will then also be possible to answer the question of whether or not every
regular variational problems possesses a solution if, with regard to bound-
ary conditions, certain assumptions are fulﬁlled and if, when necessary,
one sensibly generalizes the concept of solution.

The method of orthogonal projection. We consider the following minimum
problem
||U0 −U||2 = min!,
U ∈L.
(10.63)
We are given the element U0 of the real Hilbert space X and the closed linear sub-
space L of X. Explicitly, ||U0 −U||2 = ⟨U0 −U|U0 −U⟩. Therefore, problem (10.63)
is called a quadratic variational problem. Intuitively, if X is the 3-dimensional
Euclidean space, then we are looking for the minimal distance between the given
point U0 and the plane L. We expect that there exists a unique solution U which
is the orthogonal projection of the position vector U0 onto the plane L, and the
Pythagorean theorem from elementary geometry motivates the relation
||U0||2 = ||U||2 + ||U −U0||2.
(10.64)
Intuitively, the following theorem tells us that in a real Hilbert space, there exists
a perpendicular from a given point to the closed linear subspace L.
Theorem 10.26 Problem (10.63) has precisely one solution U.
The vector U0 −U is orthogonal to the plane L, and there holds the Pythagorean
relation (10.64).
Proof. (I) The parallelogram identity. For all U, V ∈X, we have
2||U||2 + 2||V ||2 = ||U −V ||2 + ||U + V ||2
which generalizes the Pythagorean theorem. To prove this, note that
⟨U ± V |U ± V ⟩= ⟨U|U⟩± ⟨U|V ⟩± ⟨V |U⟩+ ⟨V |V ⟩
implies ||U ± V ||2 = ||U||2 ± 2⟨U|V ⟩+ ||V ||2.
(II) Existence. Set κ := infU∈L ||U0 −U||2. Obviously, κ ≥0. There exists a
sequence (Vn) in the linear subspace L such that
lim
n→∞||U0 −Vn||2 = κ.
(10.65)
Applying the parallelogram identity,
2||U0 −Vn||2 + 2||U0 −Vm||2 = ||Vn −Vm||2 + 4||U0 −1
2(Vn + Vm)||2.
Since Vn, Vm ∈L, we get 1
2(Vn + Vm) ∈L. Hence

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm

2||U0 −Vn||2 + 2||U0 −Vm||2 ≥||Vn −Vm||2 + 4κ.
Letting n →∞and m →∞, the left-hand side goes to 4κ. Consequently, (Vn) is a
Cauchy sequence, and hence it is convergent, say, Vn →U as n →∞. By (10.65),
||U0 −U||2 = κ. Thus, U is a solution of (10.63).
(III) The abstract Euler–Lagrange equation. If U is a solution of (10.63), then
⟨U0 −U|V ⟩= 0
for all
V ∈L.
(10.66)
To show this, ﬁx the point V ∈L and set
J (t) := ||U0 −(U + tV )||2
for all
t ∈R.
Then the function J has a minimum at t = 0. Hence J ′(0) = 0. Since J (t) is equal
to
⟨U0 −(U + tV )|U0 −(U + tV )⟩= ⟨U0|U0⟩+ 2t⟨U0 −U|V ⟩+ t2⟨V |V ⟩,
we get J ′(0) = 2⟨U0 −U|V ⟩= 0.
(IV) The Pythagorean relation. It follows from ⟨U −U0|U⟩= 0 that
⟨U0|U0⟩= ⟨U + (U0 −U)|U + (U0 −U)⟩= ⟨U|U⟩+ ⟨U −U0|U −U0⟩.
(V) Uniqueness. If U and U1 are solutions of (10.63), then U and U1 satisfy
the Euler–Lagrange equation (10.66). Hence ⟨U −U1|V ⟩= 0 for all V ∈L. Letting
V := U −U1 = 0, we get U −U1 = 0.

The main theorem on quadratic minimum problems. For the minimum
problem
1
2a(U, U) −b(U) = min!,
U ∈L,
(10.67)
let us make the following assumptions.
(A1) The map b : L →R is linear on the real Hilbert space L. There exists a
constant β > 0 such that |b(U)| ≤β||U|| for all U ∈L.
(A2) The map a : L × L →R is linear in each argument and symmetric, that is,
a(U, V ) = a(V, U) for all U, V ∈L. There exist constants α > 0 and γ > 0 such
that
γ||U||2 ≤a(U, U) ≤α||U||2
for all
U ∈L.
Theorem 10.27 Problem (10.67) has a unique solution.
The proof proceeds analogously to the proof of Theorem 10.26 on orthogonal pro-
jection. This proof can be found in Problem 10.1. In the special case where L = R,
our problem reads as 1
2U 2 −bU = min!, U ∈R with the given real number b. The
unique solution reads as U = b. This follows from 1
2U 2 −bU = 1
2(U −b)2 −b2.

open set in R2. We consider the variational problem

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Theorem 10.28 For given function ϱ ∈L2(Ω), the problem (10.68) of minimal
energy has a unique solution.
Proof. We will use Theorem 10.27. To this end, we set L :=

Analogously, |a(U, V )|2 ≤||U||2 · ||V ||2 for all U ∈L. Finally, it follows from the

||U||2 ≤(1 + C)a(U, U)
for all

10.4.10 The Power of Ideas in Mathematics
A mathematician like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his
patterns are more permanent as theirs, it is because they are made with
ideas.
Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877–1947)
In a right triangle the side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The
theorem of Pythagoras says that
c2 = a2 + b2.
In words: the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
squares of the lengths of the other two legs. Mathematicians of the Pythagorean
school in ancient Greece attributed the Pythagorean theorem to the master of their
school, Pythagoras of Samos (circa 560 B.C.–480 B.C.). It is said that Pythagoras
sacriﬁced one hundred oxen to the gods in gratitude. In fact, this theorem was
already known in Babylon at the time of King Hammurabi (circa 1728 B.C.–1686
B.C.). Presumably, however, it was a mathematician of the Pythagorean school who
ﬁrst proved the Pythagorean theorem. This famous theorem appears as Proposition
47 in Book I of Euclid’s Elements (300 B.C.).
In 1940 Hermann Weyl wrote a fundamental paper where he emphasized that
the justiﬁcation of the Dirichlet principle can be based on the method of orthogonal
projection. In 1943 he applied this method to the Dirichlet prinicple for harmonic
diﬀerential forms. This way, Hodge theory obtained a sound analytic foundation.30
The notion of Hilbert space is the abstract realization of the idea of orthogonality.
To this end, one introduces the inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩
between the two elements ϕ and ψ of the Hilbert space. Recall that we say that ϕ
is orthogonal to ψ iﬀ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩= 0. The proofs of the essential theorems about Hilbert
spaces (e.g., spectral theory) are based on the notion of orthogonality. In the late
1920s, John von Neumann (1903–1955) discovered that the mathematical founda-
tion of quantum mechanics can be based on the theory of Hilbert spaces. Therefore,
the concept of orthogonality is crucial for quantum mechanics. In the early 1940s,
Feynman (1918–1988) developed a new approach to quantum mechanics. He called
the inner product ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩the transition amplitude between the two quantum states
ϕ and ψ, and he used this in order to construct his path integral.
There are ideas in mathematics, like the idea of orthogonality, which re-
main eternally young and which lose nothing of their intellectual freshness
after thousands of years.

10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
10.4.11 The Ritz Method
In order to solve the Dirichlet problem on computers, one uses the method of ﬁnite
elements in modern scientiﬁc computing. This is a special case of the Ritz method.31
The basic idea. To the original minimum problem
||U0 −U||2 = min!,
U ∈L,
(10.69)
we add the family of ﬁnite-dimensional problems
||U0 −Vn||2 = min!,
Vn ∈Ln,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(10.70)
and we make the following assumptions.
(A1) Let L be a closed linear inﬁnite-dimensional subspace of the real inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space X. We are given U0 ∈X.
(A2) We choose a sequence L1, L2, . . . of ﬁnite-dimensional linear subspaces of L
such that the union of these subspaces is dense in L.
Theorem 10.29 Each ﬁnite-dimensional problem from (10.70) has a unique so-
lution Vn, and the sequence (Vn) converges in the Hilbert space L to the unique
solution U of (10.69) as n →∞.
The method of ﬁnite elements corresponds to the special case where Ln consists of
piecewise linear (or piecewise polynomial) functions. Theorem 10.29 is the special
case of a general theorem on quadratic minimum problems in Hilbert spaces. In
order to get two-sided estimates for the minimal value of the original problem one
uses dual maximum problems. This can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect.
2.6ﬀ. In order to obtain optimal speed of convergence, one uses diﬀerent scales.

10.4 The Dirichlet Problem in Electrostatics as a Paradigm
569
In quantum chemistry, the huge software system “Gaussian” is used in order to
compute the energy levels of fairly large molecules by means of the Ritz method.
In this connection, the method of the density functional plays an important role.
This method was developed by Walter Kohn in 1965 who was awarded the Nobel
prize in chemistry in 1998. As an introduction to this topic, we refer to
H. Eschrig, The Fundamentals of Density Functional Theory, Teubner,
Leipzig, 2003.

ing.
10.4.12 The Main Existence Principle
Tonelli (1885–1946) very successfully introduced lower-semicontinuity ar-
guments into existence proofs by direct methods. He collected and pre-
sented his ideas, methods, and results in his treatise Fondamenti di Cal-
colo delle Variazioni the two volumes of which appeared in 1921 and 1923,
respectively.
Mariano Giaquinta and Stefan Hildebrandt33
We want to generalize the method of orthogonal projection for quadratic variational
problems to more general minimum problems. This way, we will obtain a universal
abstract existence principle in the calculus of variations.
The classical existence theorem. Let us make the following assumptions.
(A1) The real Hilbert space X is ﬁnite-dimensional.
(A2) Semicontinuity: The function F : X →R is lower semicontinuous. By deﬁni-
tion, this means that if Un →U in X as n →∞, then34
F(U) ≤lim inf
n→∞F(Un).
(A3) Coercivity: lim||U||→∞||F(U)|| = ∞(growth condition at inﬁnity).
Theorem 10.30 Each lower semicontinuous, coercive functional on a ﬁnite-dimen-
sional real Hilbert space has a minimum.
For example, the real function F : R →R given by
F(U)) := |U|
for all
U ∈R \ {0},
F(0) ≤0
is lower semicontinuous and coercive. This function attains the minimum at the
point U = 0.
Proof. By (A3), there exists a number R > 0 such that
||F(U)|| ≥||F(0)||
for all
U ∈X with ||U|| ≥R.
Thus, in order to compute the minimum of F on X, we can restrict ourselves to
the minimum problem
F(U) = min!,
U ∈X,
||U|| ≤R.
33 Calculus of Variations, Vols. 1, 2, Springer, Berlin, 1995.
34 Explicitly, if F(Un′) →κ as n′ →∞for any subsequence of (Un), then F(U) ≤κ.

570
10. Inﬁnite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
Set κ := inf||U||≤R F(U). Then there exists a sequence (Un) with ||Un|| ≤R for all
n such that
κ = lim
n→∞F(Un).
Since the sequence (Un) is bounded, there exists a convergent subsequence, Un′ →U
as n′ →∞. Hence ||U|| ≤R. By (A2),
F(U) ≤lim
n′→∞F(Un′) = κ.
This implies F(U) = κ.
2
Lack of compactness in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We now
want to generalize Theorem 10.30 to inﬁnite dimensions. There arises the following
diﬃculty.35
Proposition 10.31 For a Hilbert space X , the following three properties are equiv-
alent.
(i) The dimension of X is ﬁnite.
(ii) Each bounded sequence in X has a convergent subsequence.
(iii) The closed unit ball of X is compact.
Consequently, the proof of Theorem 10.30 fails in inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. However, it is possible to modify this proof by passing from convergence to
weak convergence.
The idea of weak convergence. By deﬁnition, a sequence (Un) in the Hilbert
space X is weakly convergent, denoted by
Un ⇀U as n →∞,
iﬀ⟨V |Un⟩→⟨V |U⟩as n →∞for all V ∈X.
Proposition 10.32 Each bounded sequence in a Hilbert space has a weakly con-
vergent subsequence.
If a closed ball contains a weakly convergent sequence, then it also contains the
weak limit.
On a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, convergence and weak convergence coin-
cide.
The main theorem. Let us modify the assumptions (A1)–(A3) of Theorem
10.30 above in the following way.
(B1) The dimension of the real Hilbert space X is ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
(B2) Weak semicontinuity: The function F : X →R is weakly lower semicontinu-
ous, that is, it follows from Un ⇀U in X as n →∞that
F(U) ≤lim inf
n→∞F(Un).
(B3) Coercivity: lim||U||→∞||F(U)|| = ∞.
Theorem 10.33 Each weakly lower semicontinuous, coercive functional on a real
Hilbert space has a minimum.
35 For the proofs of Propositions 10.31, 10.32, see Zeidler (1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 2.4.

Corollary 10.34 Each continuous convex coercive functional on a real Hilbert
space has a minimum.
For the proof of Theorem 10.33, replace convergence by weak convergence and ar-
gue as in the proof of Theorem 10.30. For the proof of Corollary 10.34, we refer
to Zeidler (1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 2.5. Generalizations of this theorem and many ap-
plications to variational problems and optimization problems can be found in the
author’s monograph Zeidler (1986), Vol. III. In particular, the violation of convex-
ity is responsible for the appearance of microstructures. This is studied in M¨uller
(1999) and Dolzmann (2003).
Problems
10.1 The main theorem on quadratic variational problems. Prove Theorem 10.27
analogously to Theorem 10.26 on orthogonal projection.
Solution: (I) Existence. Set F(U) := 1
2a(U, U) −b(U). Let κ := infu∈L F(U).
By (A3),
F(U) ≥γ
2 ||U||2 −β||U||.
Hence lim F||U||→∞F(U) = ∞. Furthermore, F(u) ≥−R if ||U|| ≤R. This im-
plies κ > −∞. Choose a sequence (Un) with limn→∞F(Un) = κ, and ||Un|| ≤R
for all n. From the identity
2a(Un, Un) + 2a(UmUm) = a(Un −Um, Un −Um) + a(Un + Um, Un + Um)
we get
F(Un) + F(Um) = 1
4a(Un −Um, Un −Um) + 2F
„Un + Um

«
≥γ
4 ||Un −Um||2 + 2κ.
Since F(Un)+ F(Um) →2κ as n, m →∞, the sequence (Un) is Cauchy. Hence
Un →U as n →∞. As on page 339 for the inner product, it follows that F is
continuous. Therefore, F(Un) →F(U) as n →∞. Hence F(U) = κ.
(II) The Euler–Lagrange equation. If U is a solution of the minimum problem
(10.67), then the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 10.26 shows that
a(U, V ) = b(V )
for all
V ∈L.
(III) Uniqueness. If U and U1 are solutions of (10.67), then a(U −U1, V ) = 0
for all V ∈L, by (II). Choosing V := U −U1, we get
γ||U −U1||2 ≤a(U −U1, U −U1) = 0,
and hence U −U1 = 0.

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
Whoever understands Green’s functions can understand forces in nature.
Folklore
The invention of the Green’s function brought about a tool-driven revo-
lution in mathematical physics, similar in character to the more famous
tool-driven revolution caused by the invention of electronic computers a
century and a half later. . . The Green’s function and the computer are
prime examples of intellectual tools. They are tools for clear thinking. . .
Invented in 1828 by George Green (1793–1841) and successfully applied to
classical electromagnetism, acoustics, and hydrodynamics, Green’s func-
tions were the essential link between the theories of quantum electrody-
namics by Schwinger, Feynman, and Tomonaga in 1948 and are still alive
and well today. . .
I began the application of the Green’s function to condensed matter physics
in 1956 with a study of spin-waves in ferromagnets. I found that all the
Green’s function tricks that had worked so well in quantum electrodynam-
ics worked even better in the theory of spin waves. . .
Meanwhile, the Green’s functions method was applied systematically by
Bogoliubov and other people to a whole range of problems in condensed
matter physics. The main novelty in condensed matter physics was the
appearance of temperature as an additional variable. . . A beautiful thing
happens when you make the transition from ordinary Green’s functions to
thermal Green’s functions. To make the transition, all you have to do is to
replace the real frequency of any oscillation by a complex number whose
real part is frequency and whose imaginary part is temperature1. . .
Soon after thermal Green’s functions were invented, they were applied to
solve the outstanding unsolved problem of condensed matter physics, the
problem of superconductivity. They allowed Cooper, Bardeen, and Schri-
eﬀer to understand superconductivity as an eﬀect of a particular thermal
Green’s functions expressing long-range phase-coherence between pairs of
electrons (called Cooper pairs). . .
In the 1960s, after Green’s functions had become established as the stan-
dard working tools of theoretical analysis in condensed matter physics,
the wheel of fashion in particle physics continued to turn. For a decade,
quantum ﬁeld theory and Green’s functions were unfashionable in particle

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
physics. The prevailing view was that quantum ﬁeld theory had failed in
the domain of strong interactions2. . .
Then in the 1970s, the wheel of fashion turned once more. Quantum
ﬁeld theory was back in the limelight with two enormous successes, the
Weinberg–Salam uniﬁed theory of electromagnetic and weak interactions,
and the gauge theory of strong interactions now known as quantum chro-
modynamics. Green’s functions were once again the working tools of cal-
culation, both in particle physics and in condensed matter physics. And
so they have remained up to the present day.
In the 1980’s, quantum ﬁeld theory moved oﬀin a new direction, to lattice
gauge theories in one direction and to superstring theory in another. . . The
Wilson loop is the reincarnation of a Green’s function in a lattice gauge
theory3 and there is a reincarnation of Green’s functions in superstring
theory.
Freeman Dyson
George Green and physics4
Between 1930 and 1940, several mathematicians began to investigate sys-
tematically the concept of a “weak” solution of a linear partial diﬀerential
equation, which appeared episodically (and without a name) in Poincar´e’s
work.
It was one of the main contributions of Laurent Schwartz when he saw,
in 1945, that the concept of distribution introduced by Sobolev in 1936
(which he had rediscovered independently) could give a satisfactory gen-
eralization of the Fourier transform including all the preceding ones. . . By
his own research and those of his numerous students, Laurent Schwartz
began to explore the potentialities of distributions (generalized functions)
and gradually succeeded in convincing the world of mathematicians that
this new concept should become central in all problems of mathematical
analysis, due to the greater freedom and generality it allowed in the funda-
mental operations of calculus, doing away with a great many unnecessary
restrictions and pathology.
The role of Laurent Schwartz (born 1915) in the theory of distributions is
very similar to the one played by Newton (1643–1727) and Leibniz (1646–
1716) in the history of Calculus. Contrary to popular belief, they of course
did not invent it, for derivation and integration were practiced by men such
as Cavalieri (1598–1647), Fermat (1601–1665) and Roberval (1602–1675)
when Newton and Leibniz were merely schoolboys. But they were able to
systematize the algorithms and notations of Calculus in such a way that it
became a versatile and powerful tool which we know, whereas before them
it could only be handled via complicated arguments and diagrams.

Fig. 11.1. Heaviside function
The local propagation of physical eﬀects is described mathematically by Green’s
functions. In quantum ﬁeld theory, special Green’s functions are
• n-point correlation functions of quantum ﬁelds (n-point Green’s functions).6
They are closely related to
• propagators,
• retarded propagators,
• advanced propagators.
The prototypes can be found in Sect. 11.1.2. In terms of physics, Green’s functions
describe physical processes under the inﬂuence of sharply concentrated external
forces described by the Dirac delta function. General external forces are then ob-
tained by the superposition principle. The Dirac delta function is not a classical
object, but a generalized function (also called distribution). Therefore, distribu-
tions play a crucial role in physics, in particular, in quantum ﬁeld theory. We do
not suppose that the reader is familiar with this fundamental mathematical tool.
Therefore, in this chapter, we will give an introduction to the mathematical theory
of distributions and its physical interpretation.
The theory of distributions was created by Laurent Schwartz in 1945; it was
motivated by Dirac’s approach to quantum mechanics. This was represented in
Dirac’s famous 1930 monograph Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.7 Distribu-
tions generalize a broad class of continuous and discontinuous functions. For a
classical function, one has always to worry about the existence of derivatives. The
situation changes completely for distributions.
Distributions possess derivatives of all orders.
Therefore, distributions are the right tool for the investigation of linear partial
diﬀerential equations. For example, let us introduce the discontinuous Heaviside
function
θ(t) :=
(
1
if t ≥0,
0
if t < 0
(11.1)
which jumps at the initial time t = 0 from zero to one (Fig. 11.1(a)). By convention,
the Heaviside function is continuous from the right. In the language of distributions
introduced in this chapter, the Heaviside function has the derivatives
θ′ = δ,
θ′′ = δ′,
θ′′′ = δ′′, . . .
where δ denotes the Dirac delta distribution, and δ′ denotes the ﬁrst derivative of
δ, and so on.8 We will introduce the following spaces of test functions:
6 The 2-point Green’s function is also called the Feynman propagator.
7 Laurent Schwartz was awarded the Fields medal in 1950.
8 Heaviside (1850–1925) founded the theory of telephoning in his 1892 treatise
Electrical Papers.

• the Schwartz space D(RN) of smooth functions ϕ : RN →C which have compact
support, and
• the Schwartz space S(RN) of smooth functions ϕ : R →C which are rapidly
decreasing at inﬁnity.
In addition, we will use
• the Hilbert space L2(RN) of square-integrable functions ϕ : RN →C,
Z
RN |ϕ(x)|2 dNx < ∞,
• the Schwartz space D′(RN) of distributions, and
• the Schwartz space S′(RN) of tempered distributions.
We have the following inclusions9
D(RN) ⊂S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′(RN) ⊂D′(RN).
In particular, each tempered distribution is also a distribution, but the converse
is not always true. Furthermore, the functions in the Hilbert space L2(RN) are
tempered distributions, too. Tempered distributions are crucial for the Fourier
transform. The N-dimensional Dirac delta distribution δ is characterized by the
equation
δ(ϕ) = ϕ(0)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(RN) (resp. all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN)). Therefore, δ is
both a tempered distribution and a distribution, i.e., δ ∈S′(RN) and δ ∈D′(RN).
If L a linear diﬀerential operator with constant coeﬃcients, then the solutions F of
the diﬀerential equation
LF = δ
are called fundamental solutions of the diﬀerential operator L. One of the deepest
theorems in the theory of distribution tells us that
Each nonzero linear diﬀerential operator L has a fundamental solution
which is a tempered distribution.
Green’s functions are special fundamental functions which satisfy additional bound-
ary conditions and initial conditions characterizing the speciﬁc physical situation.
The Hilbert space L2(RN) is equipped with the inner product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
Z
RN ψ(x)†ϕ(x) dNx.
This space plays a fundamental role in quantum physics. However, in order to
rigorously justify the elegant Dirac calculus used by physicists, one has to pass
from the Hilbert space L2(RN) to the larger space S′(RN) of tempered distributions.
More precisely, one has to use the triplet of spaces
S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′(RN)
called the Gelfand triplet (or rigged Hilbert space L2(RN)).

of B).

11.1 Rigorous Basic Ideas
The main goal of this chapter is to show how rigorous mathematics and the formal,
but very useful language of physicists ﬁt together. To begin with, we consider the
discrete Dirac delta function. This will serve as a preparation for introducing the
Dirac delta distribution below.

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
11.1.1 The Discrete Dirac Delta Function
The discrete Dirac delta function is the key to the Dirac delta distribution.
Folklore
For a ﬁxed number ∆t > 0, the discrete delta function is deﬁned by
δ∆t(t) :=
(
1
∆t
if 0 ≤t ≤∆t,
0
otherwise.
Intuitively, this is a force which acts on the small time interval [0, ∆t]. This force
goes to inﬁnity as ∆t →0. The Dirac delta function to be considered in Sect. 11.2
on page 589 refers to the limit of δ∆t as ∆t →+0.
Proposition 11.1 Fix time t0. For each continuous function ϕ : R →C,
lim
∆t→+0
Z
R
δ∆t(t −t0)ϕ(t)dt = ϕ(t0).
Proof. By the mean value theorem for integrals, there exists a real number τ ∈
[t0, t0 + ∆t] such that
Z
R
δ∆t(t −t0)ϕ(t)dt = 1

Z t0+∆t

ϕ(t)dt = ϕ(τ).
By continuity, ϕ(τ) goes to ϕ(t0) as ∆t →+0.

If ω = 0, then (Fδ∆t)(0) = 1/

Furthermore, for all real frequencies ω,

Approximation of white noise. In terms of physics, the discrete Dirac delta
function can be represented as a superposition of plane waves,
δ∆t(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
a∆t(ω)eiωtdω,
t ∈R
with the amplitude
a∆t(ω) := (Fδ∆t)(ω)
√
2π
,
ω ∈R.
Since lim∆t→+0 a∆t(ω) = 1/2π, the amplitudes do not depend on the frequency ω,
as ∆t →+0. Physicists say that
The discrete Dirac delta function δ∆t approximates white noise
as ∆t →+0.
The term ‘white’ comes from the fact that white light is a superposition of electro-
magnetic waves of all frequencies, and each frequency contributes approximately
the same amplitude.
11.1.2 Prototypes of Green’s Functions
The notion of Green’s function was introduced by George Green (1793–1841) in the
year 1828.10
The Green’s function describes the behavior of a physical system by kicking
it with a force which acts only during a very small time interval and which
is concentrated on a very small neighborhood of some point in the position
space.
This generalizes Newton’s inﬁnitesimal strategy from mechanics to ﬁeld theories.
Motion of a classical particle on the real line. Consider the following
initial-value problem
m¨x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(t0) = x0, ˙x(t0) = v0.
(11.2)
We are given the initial time t0, the initial position x0, the initial velocity v0, and the
smooth force function F : R →R. We are looking for the smooth position function
x : R →R. In terms of physics, problem (11.2) describes the motion x = x(t) of a
classical particle of mass m > 0 on the real line under the inﬂuence of the force F.
This force acts from left to right if it is positive. To simplify notation, set m := 1.
Proposition 11.3 The initial-value problem (11.2) has the unique solution
x(t) = x0 + P(t, t0)v0 +
Z t
t0
P(t, τ)F(τ)dτ,
t ∈R.
(11.3)
The function P(t, τ) := t −τ is called the propagator deﬁned for all t, τ ∈R.
This proposition tells us that the propagator knows all about the motion of the
mass point.
Proof. (I) Uniqueness. If there are two solutions x and x∗, then set y := x −x∗.
Thus, ¨y = 0 on R with y(0) = ˙y(0) = 0. Hence y(t) = a + bt with a = b = 0.
(II) Existence. Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields the equation

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
˙x(t) = v0 + P(t, t)F(t) +
Z t
t0
Pt(t, τ)F(τ)dτ = v0 +
Z t
t0
F(τ)dτ.
This implies ¨x(t) = F(t).
2
For t, t0 ∈R, the following two functions
Pret(t, t0) := θ(t −t0)P(t, t0)
and
Padv(t, t0) := −θ(t0 −t)P(t, t0)
are called the retarded and advanced propagator, respectively. Obviously,
P(t, t0) = Pret(t, t0) −Padv(t, t0)
for all
t, t0 ∈R.
The retarded propagator describes the motion of the mass point in the case where
the force F is switched on at time t0. That is, we replace F = F(t) by the function
Fret(t) := θ(t −t0)F(t). Explicitly, the function
x(t) := x0 + Pret(t, t0)v0 +
Z t
t0
Pret(t, τ)F(τ)dτ,
t ∈R
is a solution of problem (11.2) for t > t0. Furthermore, x(t) = x0 if t ≤t0 (i.e., the
particle rests until time t0 ).
The Green’s function. To simplify notation, set t0 = 0. The solution from
Prop. 11.3 can be written as
x(t) = x0 + P(t, 0)v0 +
Z ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)F(τ)dτ,
t ∈R.
(11.4)
The function G is called the Green’s function of the initial-value problem (11.2).
Explicitly, we set
G(t, τ) := Gret(t, τ) −Gadv(t, τ),
t, τ ∈R
along with the retarded Green’s function
Gret(t, τ) :=
(
P(t, τ)
if
0 ≤τ ≤t,
0
otherwise
and the advanced Green’s function
Gadv(t, τ) :=
(
P(t, τ)
if
t ≤τ < 0,
0
otherwise.
The equations (11.2) and (11.4) reﬂect the duality between diﬀerential- and integral
relations. In order to understand the physical meaning of the Green’s function,
choose the initial condition x(0) = ˙x(0) = 0, that is, the particle rests at time
t = 0. Furthermore, for small ∆t > 0 and ﬁxed time t1, we choose the force
F(t) := δ∆t(t −t1)
t ∈R.
The initial-value problem (11.2) has then the classical solution
x(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)δ∆t(τ −t1)dτ
for all times t ∈R diﬀerent from the points t1 and t1 + ∆t where the force jumps.
The position function x = x(t) is continuous for all times t ∈R.

Proposition 11.4 For all times t, t1 ∈R with t ̸= t1,
lim
∆t→+0
Z ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)δ∆t(τ −t1)dτ = G(t, t1).
This proposition tells us that the Green’s function describes the response of the
particle to a constant force F acting on the small time interval [t1, t1 + ∆t] nor-
malized by
R ∞
−∞F(t)dt = 1. In addition, we assume that the particle rests at the
initial time t = 0.
Proof. The Green’s function G = G(t, τ) is continuous for all (t, τ) ∈R2 with
t ̸= τ. Thus, for t ̸= t1,

One checks easily that
G(t, t1) = G(t −t1, 0)
for all
t, t1 ∈R.
This relation reﬂects causality.
The prototype of the Schr¨odinger equation. Let A be a ﬁxed complex
number. We want to study the initial-value problem
˙x(t) = Ax(t) + F(t),
t ∈R,
x(t0) = x0.
(11.5)
We are given the initial time t0, the initial position x0 ∈C, and the smooth external
source F : R →C. We are looking for a smooth function x : R →C.
Proposition 11.5 Problem (11.5) has the unique solution
x(t) = P(t, t0)x0 +
Z t
t0
P(t, τ)F(τ)dτ,
t ∈R
with the propagator P(t, τ) := eA(t−τ) for all t, τ ∈R.
The proof parallels the proof of Proposition 11.3. Replacing the propagator
P(t, τ) := t−τ by the new propagator P(t, τ) := eA(t−τ), we introduce the functions
Pret, Padv, G, Gret, Gadv as described above. In particular, Prop. 11.4 remains valid.

Consider the problem

where the Fourier coeﬃcients bk are complex numbers. Furthermore, we are given
the angular frequency ω > 0 such that ω ̸= ωk for all k = 1, 2, . . . We are looking
for the smooth T -periodic position function x : R →C. The real and imaginary
parts of the function x = x(t) describe the oscillation of a mass point on the real
line of time period T.

(II) Uniqueness. Let t →x1(t) and t →x2(t) be two solutions of (11.6). For the
diﬀerence x(t) := x1(t) −x2(t), we get ¨x + ω2x = 0. Since x : R →C is 2π-periodic
and smooth, we have the Fourier series

(ω2 −k2)akeikt = 0.
This implies (ω2 −k2)ak = 0 for all integers k. Hence ak = 0 for all k. Therefore,
x(t) ≡0.

The critical resonance case and the method of regularization. For ﬁxed
k0 = 1, 2, . . . , choose the critical angular frequency
ω = ωk0.
In this case, the homogeneous problem (11.6) with F(t) ≡0 has the general solution
x(t) = ak0e2πik0t/T + a−k0e−2πik0t/T ,
t ∈R
with arbitrary complex numbers a±k0. These solutions correspond to eigenoscilla-
tions with the angular frequency ωk0 = 2πk0/T.
Proposition 11.7 The inhomogeneous problem (11.6) has a solution iﬀthe ex-
ternal force F satisﬁes the non-resonance condition bk0 = b−k0 = 0. The general
solution of (11.6) is then given by

lowing peculiarity. Let T = 2π. If x = x(t) is a solution of (11.6), then
(−k2 + ω2
k0)ak = bk,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
Since ωk0 = k2

11.1.3 The Heat Equation and the Heat Kernel
We now want to study the prototype of the Green’s function for a classical ﬁeld
theory. This is Fourier’s famous heat kernel. Let ψ(x, t) be the temperature of a
homogeneous body at position x and time t. By Fourier’s law, variations of the
temperature generate a heat current density vector given by
J = −κ grad ψ
where the material constant κ > 0 is called the heat conductivity of the body. The
conservation law for heat,
∂ψ
∂t + div J = 0,
yields the heat conduction equation
∂ψ
∂t = −κ∆ψ.
(11.8)
In his 1822 treatise On the Theory of Heat, Fourier used the Fourier transform in
order to obtain the famous solution formula
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, s)ψ(y, s)d3y,
x ∈R3, t > s
(11.9)
with the so-called heat kernel
K(x, t; y, s) :=

−(x−y)2
4κ(t−s)
for all position vectors x, y ∈R3, and all times t, s ∈R with t > s. If we know the
temperature ψ(y, s) at the initial time s, then formula (11.9) yields the temperature
ψ(x, t) at each later time t > s. In order to get the physical interpretation of the heat
kernel, choose an initial temperature ψ(y, s) := δε(y) at time s which is localized
in a small neighborhood of the point y = 0. Explicitly,
δε(y) :=
(

if
||y|| ≤ε

where V (ε) = 4
3πε3 is the volume of a sphere of radius ε. Letting ε →0, we get the
temperature
K(x, t; 0, s) = lim
ε→0
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, s)δε(y)d3y
at the point x at time t > 0. Physicists say brieﬂy that the initial temperature
δ(y), which is sharply concentrated at the origin at time s, induces the temperature
K(x, t; 0, s) at each point x and each time t > s.
The classical approach. For the temperature function ψ = ψ(x, t), consider
the initial-value problem
∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= −κ∆ψ(x, t) + f(x, t),
x ∈R3, t ≥0,
ψ(x, 0) = ψ0(x),
x ∈R3.
(11.10)

11.1 Rigorous Basic Ideas
587
Here, κ > 0. We are given both the smooth initial temperature ψ0 ∈S(R3), and
the external heat source f = f(x, t) which is smooth on R3 ×[0, ∞[. In addition, we
assume that the function x →f(x, t) lies in the space S(R3) for each time t ≥0. We
are looking for a solution ψ = ψ(x, t) which is smooth on R3× ]0, ∞[, continuous
on R3 × [0, ∞[ , and bounded on R3 × [0, t1] for each t1 > 0.
Theorem 11.8 The initial-value problem (11.10) has a unique solution given by
ψ(x, t) =

Z t

dτ
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, τ) f(y, τ) d3y
(11.11)
for all position vectors x ∈R and all times t > 0.
The heat kernel is also called the Feynman propagator kernel of the heat equation.
The proof of this classical result can be found in Triebel (1989), Sect. 41. In fact,
careful diﬀerentiation of (11.11) shows that ψ is a solution of (11.10). Uniqueness
follows from the maximum principle.
Perturbation theory. Instead of (11.10), let us consider the modiﬁed initial-
value problem
∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= −κ∆ψ(x, t) −U(x)ψ(x, t),
x ∈R3, t ≥0,
ψ(x, 0) = ψ0(x),
x ∈R3.
(11.12)
By Theorem 11.8, we obtain the Volterra integral equation
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, 0) ψ0(y) d3y
−
Z t
0
dτ
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, τ)U(y) ψ(y, τ) d3y
which can be solved by an iterative method. As ﬁrst approximation, we get
ψ(x, t) =

R3 K(x, t; y, 0) ψ0(y) d3y
−
Z t

dτ
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, τ)U(y) ψ0(y) d3y.
11.1.4 The Diﬀusion Equation
The heat equation (11.8) also describes a diﬀusion process in 3-dimensional space.
In this case, ψ(x, t) describes the density of a ﬂuid at the point x at time t. The
number κ > 0 is called the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

Here, P = −iℏ∂. This Schr¨odinger equation describes the motion of a free quan-
tum particle of mass m (e.g., an electron) on the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.
Replacing time t by it and applying formal analytic continuation to the solution
formula (11.11), we get

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach

More precisely, as the domain of deﬁnition of the operator
H0 : D(H0) ⊆L2(R3) →L2(R3),
we choose the Sobolev space D(H0) := W 2
2 (R3). By deﬁnition, this space consists
of all functions ϕ ∈L2(R3) whose ﬁrst and second partial derivatives, in the sense
of generalized functions, lie in L2(R3), too (see page 611). Since the operator H0
is self-adjoint, the operator e−iH0t/ℏ: L2(R3) →L2(R3) is unitary, by the classical
Stone theorem. The Hilbert space function
ψ(t) := e−iH0t/ℏψ0,
t ∈R
(11.17)
represents the generalized solution of (11.15) for each given ψ0 ∈L2(R3).
Theorem 11.9 For each given function ψ0 ∈S(R3), the solution (11.17) coincides
with (11.16).
The proof can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 5.22.2.
11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
Our work led us to consider quantities involving a certain kind of inﬁnity.
To get a precise notation for dealing with these inﬁnities, we introduce a
quantity δ(t) depending on a parameter t satisfying a condition
Z ∞
−∞
δ(t)dt = 1
and
δ(t) = 0
for
t ̸= 0.
(11.18)
This is not a function according to the usual mathematical deﬁnition of
a function, but is something more general. . . Thus δ(t) is not a quantity
which can be generally used in mathematical analysis like an ordinary
function, but its use must be conﬁned to certain simple kinds of expressions
for which it is obvious that no inconsistency can arise.
Paul Dirac, 1930
Principles of Quantum Mechanics11
In order to understand the Dirac delta function δ, use the discrete Dirac
delta function δ∆t and carry out the limit ∆t →0 at the right place.
Folklore
In this section, let us discuss the Dirac delta function in the language used by
physicists. The following formal considerations will be given a rigorous meaning
later on. However, it is useful to know the language of physicists as a mnemonic
tool for the rigorous approach.

11.2.1 Dirac’s Delta Function
The use of the Dirac delta function in physics is based on the following formal
formulas:
(i) Limit: lim∆t→0 δ∆t(t) = δ(t) for all t ∈R.
(ii) Support: δ(t) = 0 for all t ∈R with t ̸= 0.
(iii) Characteristic property: Fix the real time t0. For each continuous function
ϕ : R →C,
Z
R
δ(t −t0)ϕ(t)dt = ϕ(t0).
(11.19)
Moreover, δ(t −t0) = δ(t0 −t) for all t, t0 ∈R.
(iv) Fourier transform: Fix the real time t0. For all real frequencies ω,
1

(t).
Motivation. The relations (ii) through (v) can be obtained from Sect. 11.1.1
by using the corresponding relations for the discrete Dirac delta function δ∆t and
formally carrying out the limit ∆t →0. Mnemonically, the Fourier transformation
formula (iv) follows immediately from the characteristic property (iii). This implies
(v) by using the inverse Fourier transform from Sect. 10.3.3 on page 535 in a formal
way.
The need for introducing generalized functions. There does not exist
any classical function δ which satisﬁes relations (i) through (v) above. In fact, if a
classical solution f : R →C has the property that f(t) = 0 for all t ∈R with t ̸= 0,
then
Z
R
f(t)ϕ(t)dt = 0
for all smooth functions ϕ : R →C. Therefore, relations (ii) and (iii) are contra-
dictory for a classical function. However, we will show below that there exists a
generalized function δ in the sense of Laurent Schwartz which has rigorous proper-
ties that resemble the formal properties (i) through (v) summarized above.

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach

11.2.2 Density of a Mass Distribution
The Dirac delta function allows us to handle continuous and discrete mass
distributions on equal footing by using mass density functions.
Folklore
Continuous mass distribution. Let ϱ : R →R be a continuous nonnegative
function. Physically, this function can be regarded as the mass density of a mass
distribution on the real line. The number
m =
Z b
a
ϱ(x)dx
then represents the mass on the ﬁnite interval [a, b].
Discrete mass distribution. Consider now a point of mass m > 0 at the
coordinate x0 on the real line. Formally, we assign the mass density function
ϱ(x) := m · δ(x −x0)
for all
x ∈R
to the mass point. To motivate this formal convention, note that ϱ(x) = 0 for all
points x on the real line diﬀerent from x0. This means that there is no mass at the
points diﬀerent from x0. Moreover,
Z
R
ϱ(x)dx = m,
that is, the total mass equals m.
Approximation of a mass point. For ﬁxed ∆x > 0, choose the mass density
ϱ∆x(x) := m · δ∆x(x −x0)
for all
x ∈R.
Then, we have ϱ∆x(x) = 0 for all points x on the real line outside the small interval
[x0, x0 + ∆x]. Furthermore,
Z
R
ϱ∆x(x)dx =
1
∆x
Z x0+∆x
x0
mdx = m.
Letting ∆x →0, the interval [x0, x0 + ∆x] shrinks to the point x0. Formally, we
write
lim
∆x→+0 ϱ∆x(x) = m · δ(x −x0)
for all
x ∈R.
11.2.3 Local Functional Derivative
Local functional derivatives are frequently used in quantum ﬁeld theory.
They generalize classical partial derivatives to an inﬁnite number of vari-
ables.
Folklore
The Dirac delta function as a generalized Kronecker symbol. Recall that
δkk := 1 and δkl = 0 if k ̸= l. For a given ﬁnite interval [a, b] on the real line,
consider the partition points
xk := a + k∆x,
k = 0, 1, . . . N
with ∆x := (b −a)/N. Then

∆x · ∆x = f(xk),
k = 1, . . . , N.
The formal limit yields
Z b
a
f(x)δ(x −y) · dx = f(y),
a < y < b.
Classical partial derivatives. Let f : Rn →R be a function of n real variables
x1, . . . , xn. The partial derivative is deﬁned by
∂f(x1, . . . , xn)
∂xk
= d
dtf(x1 + tδ1k, . . . , xn + tδkn)|t=0.
Therefore
∂xj
∂xk = δjk,
j, k = 1, . . . , n.
(11.20)
This corresponds to f(x1, . . . , xn) := xj for all x1, . . . , xn ∈R.
Local functional derivative. By a real functional on the real line, we mean
a map J →Z(J) which assigns a real number Z(J) to each function J : R →R.
If necessary, we restrict ourselves to continuous functions J, smooth functions,
integrable functions, and so on. Replacing the Kronecker symbol by the Dirac delta
function, we formally deﬁne the functional derivative by setting
δZ(J)
δJ(y) := d
dtZ(J + tδy)|t=0
(11.21)
where δy(x) := δ(x −y). Parallel to (11.20), we get
δJ(x)
δJ(y) = δ(x −y),
x, y ∈R.
This corresponds to (11.21) by choosing the functional Z(J) := J(x) for all func-
tions J : R →R and ﬁxed x ∈R. Let us consider some examples.
(i) Consider the functional
Z(J) :=
Z
R
ϱ(x)J(x)dx
for all continuous functions J : R →R and ﬁxed continuous function ϱ : R →R.
Formally diﬀerentiating the expression
Z(J + tδy) =
Z
R
ϱ(x)(J(x) + tδ(x −y)) dx
with respect to the variable t at the point t = 0, we get
δZ(J)
δJ(y) =
Z
R
ϱ(x)δ(x −y) dx = ϱ(y).

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach

(ii) Let ϱ(x, y) = ϱ(y, x) for all x, y ∈R. For the functional
Z(J) := 1
2
Z
R2 ϱ(x, y)J(x)J(y) dxdy
we obtain
δ2Z(J)
δJ(y0)δJ(x0) = ϱ(x0, y0)
for all
x0, y0 ∈R.
(11.22)
In fact, formally diﬀerentiating the function
Z(J + tδx0) = 1
2
Z
R2 ϱ(x, y)(J(x) + tδ(x −x0))(J(y) + tδ(y −x0)) dxdy
with respect to t at the point t = 0, we get that the local functional derivative
δZ(J)
δJ(x0)
is equal to

Z
R2 ϱ(x, y)δ(x −x0)J(y) dxdy + 1

δJ(x0)
=
Z
R
ϱ(x0, y)(J(y) + tδ(y −y0)) dy
with respect to t at t = 0, we get
R
R ϱ(x0, y)δ(y −y0)dy = ϱ(x0, y0). This is the
claim (11.22).
(iii) Let −∞< t1 < τ < t2 < ∞. For the functional
S[q] :=
Z t2
t1
{ 1
2 ˙q(t)2 −1
2q(t)2 + q(t)F(t)} dt,
we obtain
δS[q]
δq(τ) = −¨q(τ) −q(τ) + F(τ).
In fact, formally diﬀerentiating the function
S[q + sδτ)] =
Z t2
t1
{ 1
2( ˙q(t) + s ˙δ(t −τ))2
−1
2(q(t) + sδ(t −τ))2 + (q(t) + δ(t −τ))F(t)} dt
with respect to the variable s at the point s = 0, we get
δS[q]
δq(τ) =
Z t2
t1
{ ˙q(t) ˙δ(t −τ) −q(t)δ(t −τ) + F(t)δ(t −τ)} dt.
Finally, integration by parts yields
δS[q]
δq(τ) =
Z t2
t1
(−¨q(t) −q(t) + F(t))δ(t −τ) dt = −¨q(τ) −q(τ) + F(τ).

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
The relation to functional derivatives used in mathematics. Let us
consider a typical example which arises in the calculus of variations. To this end,
introduce the space C∞
b [t1, t2] of smooth functions q : [t1, t2] →R which satisfy the
boundary condition q(t1) = q(t2) = 0. Deﬁne the functional S : C∞
b [t1, t2] →R by
setting
S[q] :=
Z t2
t1
{ 1
2 ˙q(t)2 −1
2q(t)2 + q(t)F(t)} dt.
Here, the continuous function F : [t1, t2] →R is ﬁxed. For given functions q, h ∈
C∞
b [t1, t2], the functional derivative of the functional S at the point q in direction
of h is deﬁned by
δS[q]
δq (h) = d
dsS[q + sh]|s=0.
Explicitly, diﬀerentiating the function
S[q + sh] =
Z t2
t1
{( ˙q(t) + s˙h(t))2 −(q(t) + sh(t))2 + (q(t) + h(t))F(t)} dt
of the real variable s at the point s = 0, we obtain
δS[q]
δq (h) =
Z t2
t1
( ˙q(t)˙h(t) −q(t)h(t) + h(t)F(t)) dt.
Integration by parts yields
δS[q]
δq (h) =
Z t2
t1
(−¨q(t) −q(t) + F(t))h(t) dt.
Deﬁning
δS[q]
δq(t) := −¨q(t) −q(t) + F(t),
we obtain
δS[q]
δq (h) =
Z t2
t1
δS[q]
δq(t) · h(t) dt.
(11.23)
Naturally enough, the function
t →δS[q]
δq(t)
is called the density function of the functional derivative
δS[q]
δq
: C∞
b [t1, t2] →R.
Note that the density function coincides with the local functional derivative intro-
duced above in a formal way. Setting δq := h, let us write the key formula (11.23)
as
δS =
Z t2

δq(t) · δq(t) dt.
This formula resembles the classical formula

(11.24)
Here, the function q is a solution iﬀ
δS[q]
δq (h) = 0

By the variational lemma on page 542, this is equivalent to
δS[q]
δq(t) = 0
for all
t ∈[t1, t2].
Explicitly, this means that ¨q(t) + q(t) = F(t) for all t ∈[t1, t2]. This is the Euler–
Lagrange equation to the variational problem (11.24).
11.2.4 The Substitution Rule
In quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists use frequently the function x →δ(f(x)). We

δ(f(x)) :=

j=1
δ(x −xj)
|f ′(xj)|
for all

(11.25)
Here, we assume that the function f : R →R is smooth, and it has precisely the
zeros x1, . . . , xN. In addition, suppose that the zeros are non-degenerate, that is,
f ′(xj) ̸= 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N. For example, if a is a nonzero real number and
x0 ∈R, then
δ(a(x −x0)) := δ(x −x0)
|a|
for all
x ∈R.
Furthermore, if a > 0, then
δ(x2 −a2) = δ(x −a)

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
Let us now motivate the deﬁnition (11.25). Suppose ﬁrst that the smooth func-
tion f : R →R has the only zero x1. In addition, let f ′(x1) > 0. Set
J :=
Z x1+∆x
x1−∆x
δ(f(x))ϕ(x)dx.
For suﬃciently small ∆x > 0, the function f is monotone increasing on the interval
[x1 −∆x, x1 + ∆x]. Using the substitution y = f(x), we get
J =
Z f(x1+∆x)
f(x1−∆x)
δ(y)ϕ(x(y))dx(y)
dy
dy.
Since f(x1) = 0,
J = ϕ(x(0))dx(0)
dy
= ϕ(x1)
f ′(x1).
If f ′(x1) < 0, then we get an additional minus sign. Finally, the case of several
zeros can be reduced to the case of one zero, by localization.
11.2.5 Formal Dirac Calculus and the Fourier Transform
It is worth noting that notation facilitates discovery. This, in a most won-
derful way, reduces the mind’s labor.
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716)
We want to show that the Dirac calculus represents the most elegant mnemonic
method in order to memorize the Fourier transform and, more general, all kinds of
eigenfunction expansions appearing in mathematics and physics. In this section, we
are going to generalize the rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional Dirac calculus from Sect. 7.11
on page 359 to inﬁnite dimensions in a formal, but very useful way. In 1955 Gelfand
and Kostyuchenko published a rigorous justiﬁcation of the general Dirac calculus
in terms of an extension of von Neumann’s spectral theory to rigged Hilbert spaces;
they used distributions as generalized eigenfunctions (see Sect. 12.2 on page 675).
States, costates, and generalized states. Let x, p ∈R. It turns out that for
the complete description of a quantum particle on the real line, the notion of states
in a Hilbert space is not suﬃcient. One also needs costates and generalized states
which are related to the duality theory of Hilbert spaces in mathematics. Following
Dirac, we introduce the following symbols:
• state |ψ⟩of a quantum particle on the real line;
• costate ⟨F| of a quantum particle on the real line;
• generalized state |F⟩which is dual to the costate ⟨F|;
• position costate ⟨x|;12
• generalized position state |x⟩;
• momentum costate ⟨p|;
• generalized momentum state |p⟩;
12 Intuitively, ⟨x|ψ⟩is the value ψ(x) of the Schr¨odinger wave function ψ at the
point x.
The state |x⟩describes a quantum particle on the real line which is localized at
the point x. This is a highly idealized situation.
The state |p⟩describes a quantum particle on the real line which has the sharp
momentum p.

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
597
• to each state |ψ⟩we assign a uniquely determined costate which is denoted by
⟨ψ|.
Below we will use the following notation: |ϕ⟩, |ψ⟩, |χ⟩are states, ⟨F|, ⟨G| are
costates, and α, β are complex numbers. We ﬁrst postulate that the linear com-
binations
α|ϕ⟩+ β|ψ⟩
and
α⟨F| + β⟨G|
and
α|F⟩+ β|G⟩
make sense, that is, states, costates, and generalized states form a complex linear
space, respectively. Secondly, we postulate that the following products are deﬁned:
• ⟨F| · |ψ⟩(dual pairing);
• |ψ⟩⟨F| (tensor product);
• ⟨ψ| · |F⟩(antidual pairing).
Here, ⟨F| · |ψ⟩is a complex number which relates the abstract quantities ⟨F| and
|ψ⟩to physical measurement processes. We assume that the following properties
hold true:
• Distributivity: ⟨F| · (α|ϕ⟩+ β|ψ⟩) = α⟨F| · |ϕ⟩+ β⟨F| · |ψ⟩, and
(α⟨F| + β⟨G|) · |ψ⟩= α⟨F| · |ϕ⟩+ β⟨G| · |ψ⟩.
• Anticommutativity: ⟨ψ| · |ϕ⟩= (⟨ϕ| · ψ⟩)† and ⟨ψ| · |F⟩= (⟨F| · |ψ⟩)†.
• Associativity: (|ϕ⟩· ⟨F|) · |ψ⟩:= |ϕ⟩· (⟨F| · |ψ⟩).
To simplify notation, we write
⟨F|ψ⟩:= ⟨F| · |ψ⟩,
and ⟨ψ|F⟩:= ⟨ψ|·|F⟩, as well as |αϕ+βψ⟩:= α|ϕ⟩+β|ψ⟩. This yields the following
formulas:
(a) ⟨F|αϕ + βψ⟩= α⟨F|ϕ⟩+ β⟨F|ψ⟩;
(b) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩†;
(c) ⟨ψ|F⟩= ⟨F|ψ⟩†;
(d) |ϕ⟩⟨F| · |ψ⟩= |ϕ⟩⟨F|ψ⟩= ⟨F|ψ⟩|ϕ⟩.
(e) ⟨αϕ + βψ|χ⟩= α†⟨ϕ|χ⟩+ β†⟨ψ|χ⟩;
(f) ⟨αϕ + βψ|F⟩= α†⟨ϕ|F⟩+ β†⟨ψ|F⟩.
In fact, ⟨αϕ + βψ|χ⟩is equal to
⟨χ|αϕ + βψ⟩† = (α⟨χ|ϕ⟩+ β⟨χ|ψ⟩)† = α†⟨ϕ|χ⟩+ β†⟨ψ|χ⟩.
Similarly, we argue for motivating (f). In terms of mathematics, the following hold
true.
• By (a), costates ⟨F| are linear functionals, and ⟨F|ψ⟩is the value F(ψ) of the
functional F at the point ψ.
• By (f), generalized states |F⟩are antilinear functionals where ⟨ψ|F⟩is the value
F(ψ) of the functional at the point ψ.
• By (d), the product |ϕ⟩· ⟨F| corresponds to the tensor product ϕ ⊗F.
The key relations. In the late 1920’s, Dirac noticed that the classical Fourier
transform can be elegantly reformulated in terms of the following key relations for
states and costates. Let x, y, p, q ∈R.

598
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
(K1) Dual pairing between states and position costates:
⟨x|ψ⟩= ψ(x).
In terms of physics, the complex-valued function x →ψ(x) is the famous
Schr¨odinger wave function of the quantum particle on the real line. Further-
more,
⟨ψ|x⟩= ⟨x|ψ⟩† = ψ(x)†.
(K2) Dual pairing between position costates and generalized momentum states:
⟨x|p⟩= eipx/ℏ
√
2πℏ
.
The function x →⟨x|p⟩represents the Schr¨odinger wave function of a particle
on the real line which has the momentum p.13
(K3) Orthogonality relation for position states: ⟨x|y⟩= δ(x −y).
(K4) Completeness relation for position states:
Z
R
|x⟩⟨x| dx = I
where I denotes the identity operator.
(K5) Orthogonality relation for momentum states: ⟨p|q⟩= δ(p −q).
(K6) Completeness relation for momentum states:
Z
R
|p⟩⟨p| dp = I.
(K7) Matrix elements of the position operator X: For all x, y ∈X,
⟨x|X|y⟩:= xδ(x −y).
This implies ⟨x|X|y⟩† = ⟨y|X|x⟩.
(K8) Matrix elements of the momentum operator P: For all p, q ∈R,
⟨p|P|q⟩:= pδ(p −q).
Hence ⟨p|P|q⟩† = ⟨q|P|p⟩.
The Fourier transform. Let us now show that (K1) through (K8) summarize
all of the properties of both the Fourier transform and the Dirac delta function.
(i) Inner product: For all states |ψ⟩and |ϕ⟩,
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†ψ(x)dx.
(11.28)
To get this in a formal way, we start with the trivial identity
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|I|ψ⟩.
13 Note that
R
R |eipx/ℏ|2dx = ∞. Therefore, the function x →⟨x|p⟩does not lie in
the Hilbert space L2(R).

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
599
We now apply Dirac’s substitution trick. Explicitly, we replace the identity
operator I by the completeness relation (K4) for the position operator. Thus,
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ϕ|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩dx.
This is identical with (11.28).
(ii) Fourier transform: By Dirac’s substitution trick,
⟨p|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨p|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩dx.
Setting ˆψ(p) := ⟨p|x⟩, we obtain
ˆψ(p) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
e−ipx/ℏψ(x) dx.
This shows that ˆψ is the Fourier transform of ψ.
(iii) Inverse Fourier transform: By Dirac’s substitution trick and the completeness
relation (K6) for the momentum states,
⟨x|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|p⟩⟨p|ψ⟩dp.
Explicitly, this is the inverse Fourier transform,
ψ(x) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
eipx/ℏˆψ(p) dp.
(iv) The Parseval equation: By Dirac’s substitution trick,
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ϕ|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩dx =
Z
R
⟨ϕ|p⟩⟨p|ψ⟩dp.
Hence
Z
R
ϕ(x)†ψ(x) dx =
Z
R
ˆϕ(p)† ˆψ(p) dp.
This is the Parseval equation for the Fourier transform.
(v) The Dirac delta function in position space: By Dirac’s substitution trick,
⟨x|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|y⟩⟨y|ψ⟩dy.
This means that
ψ(x) =
Z
R
δ(x −y)ψ(y)dy
which is the characteristic property of the Dirac delta function. Using the
orthogonality relation for position states and Dirac’s substitution trick with
respect to the completeness relation for momentum states, we obtain

600
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
⟨x|y⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|p⟩⟨p|y⟩dp.
Hence
δ(x −y) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R
eip(x−y)/ℏdp.
(11.29)
This is the representation of the Dirac delta function by a Fourier integral.
(vi) The Dirac delta function in momentum space: Using the orthogonality rela-
tion for momentum states and Dirac’s substitution trick with respect to the
completeness relation for position states, we obtain
⟨p|q⟩=
Z
R
⟨p|x⟩⟨x|q⟩dx.
Hence
δ(p −q) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R
eix(q−p)/ℏdx.
Noting the invariance of the integral under the reﬂection x →−x, this formula
is equivalent to (11.29).
(vii) The position operator X in position space: For each state |ψ⟩and all x ∈R,
⟨x|X|ψ⟩= x⟨x|ψ⟩.
(11.30)
We say that ⟨x| is an eigencostate of the position operator X. In fact, by Dirac’s
substitution trick,
⟨x|X|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|X|y⟩⟨y|ψ⟩dy.
(11.31)
Hence
⟨x|X|ψ⟩=
Z
R
xδ(x −y)ψ(y)dy = xψ(x) = x⟨x|ψ⟩.
Equation (11.30) can be written as
(Xψ)(x) = xψ(x)
for all
x ∈R.
This means that the position operator X corresponds to the multiplication
operator with respect to Schr¨odinger’s wave function ψ of the quantum particle
in the position space. Introducing the kernel
KX(x, y) := ⟨x|X|y⟩,
x, y ∈R
of the position operator X, equation (11.31) corresponds to the so-called kernel
equation
(Xψ)(x) =
Z
R
KX(x, y)ψ(y)dy
for all
x ∈R
with KX(x, y) = xδ(x −y). By deﬁnition, the real number

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
601
x = ⟨ψ|X|ψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩
=
R
R ψ(x)†xψ(x)dx
R
R ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx
is the mean position of the quantum particle in the nonzero state |ψ⟩on the
real line. Finally, let us motivate the equality
X|x⟩= x|x⟩
for all
x ∈R.
This means that |x⟩is a generalized eigenstate of the position operator X with
the corresponding real eigenvalue x. In fact, by Dirac’s substitution trick,
X|x⟩=
Z
R
|y⟩⟨y|X|x⟩dy =
Z
R
|y⟩yδ(y −x) dy = x|x⟩.
(viii) The momentum operator P in momentum space: The operator P plays the
same role in the momentum space as the position operator in the position
space. Replacing X, |x⟩, ⟨x| by P, |p⟩, ⟨p|, respectively, we obtain that for all
states ψ and all p ∈R,
⟨p|Pψ⟩= p ⟨p|ψ⟩
(11.32)
and
P|p⟩= p|p⟩.
(11.33)
Equation (11.32) tells us that
F(Pψ)(p) = pF(ψ)(p)
for all
p ∈R.
This means that the momentum operator P represents the multiplication op-
erator after carrying out the Fourier transform. Instead of (11.33) and (11.32),
we say that ⟨p| and |p⟩are an eigencostate and a generalized eigenstate, re-
spectively, of the momentum operator P with the real eigenvalue p.
(ix) The momentum operator P in position space: It follows from
ψ(x) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
eipx/ℏˆψ(p)dp
that
−iℏd
dxψ(x) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
eipx/ℏp ˆψ(p)dp.
(11.34)
Consequently, the multiplication operator ˆψ(p) →p ˆψ(p) in the Fourier space
corresponds to the operator ψ(x) →−iℏψ′(x) in the position space. Explicitly,
(Pψ)(x) =
„
−iℏd
dxψ
«
(x)
for all
x ∈R.
In the language of the Dirac calculus, we have
⟨x|Pψ⟩= −iℏd
dx⟨x|ψ⟩.

602
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
This follows from (11.32) and (11.34) along with
⟨x|Pψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|p⟩⟨p|P|ψ⟩dp =
Z
R
⟨x|p⟩p⟨p|ψ⟩dp
= −iℏd
dxψ(x) = −iℏd
dx⟨x|ψ⟩.
The energy operator. In terms of the formal Dirac calculus, we now want to
study the energy of a quantum particle on the real line. To this end, we postulate
that there exists a measure µ on the real line along with the measure integral
Z
R
f(E)dµ(E).
By deﬁnition, the zero set, zero(µ), of the measure µ is the largest open subset
of the real line R such that the measure vanishes on this set. By deﬁnition, the
complement
supp(µ) := R \ zero(µ)
is called the support of the measure µ. For a reasonable subset S of the real line,
the number
µ(S) =
Z
S
dµ(E)
represents the measure of the set S. Moreover, we introduce the formal Dirac delta
function δµ with respect to the measure µ by postulating the characteristic property
Z
R
δµ(E, E0)f(E)dµ(E) = f(E0)
for all
E0 ∈R.
Furthermore, we postulate that
• δµ(E, E0) = 0 if E ̸= E0.
• δµ(E, E) = 0 if E /∈supp(µ).
• δµ(E, E)† = δµ(E, E).
To illustrate the notion of measure, let us consider two typical examples.
• Discrete mass distribution: Consider n points E1, . . . , En on the real line which
have the positive masses m1, . . . , mn, respectively. Then
Z
R
f(E)dµ(E) =
n
X
k=1
f(Ek)mk.
The support of the measure µ is equal to the ﬁnite set {E1, . . . , En}.
• Continuous mass distribution: Let ϱ : R →R be a nonnegative continuous func-
tion. In terms of physics, the function ϱ represents a mass density on the real
line. Then
Z
R
f(E)dµ(E) =
Z
R
f(E)ϱ(E)dE
if the right-hand integral exists. The set zero(ϱ) is the largest open subset of R
on which the density function ϱ vanishes.
Following Dirac, we introduce the following symbols for all E ∈R :
• the energetic costate ⟨E|;
• the generalized energetic state |E⟩.14
14 Intuitively, |E⟩corresponds to a quantum particle on the real line which has the
energy E. If the function x →⟨x|E⟩lies in the Hilbert space L2(R), then |E⟩
is called a classical quantum state. This is not always the case. Therefore, we
speak of the generalized energy state |E⟩.

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
603
We also set |E⟩= 0 and ⟨E| = 0 if E /∈supp(µ). Furthermore, we postulate that
the following key relations hold true for all E, E′ ∈R:
(E1) Orthogonality: ⟨E′|E⟩= δµ(E′, E).
(E2) Completeness:
Z
R
|E⟩⟨E| dµ(E) = I.
(E3) Matrix elements of the energy operator H:
⟨E′|H|E⟩= Eδµ(E′, E).
Furthermore, ⟨E′|H|E⟩† = ⟨E|H|E′⟩.
Instead of the symbol supp(µ) we synonymously write σ(H), and we call this the
spectrum of the energy operator (or Hamiltonian) H. Intuitively, the energy spec-
trum σ(H) is the set of all possible energy values E of quantum particles on the
real line which correspond to the physical situation described by the operator H
(e.g., a ﬁxed potential). Let us discuss some formal consequences of the conditions
(E1) through (E3).
(i) Energetic Fourier transform: By the completeness condition for position states,
⟨E|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨E|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩dx.
Setting ˆψ(E) := ⟨E|ψ⟩and χE(x) := ⟨x|E⟩, this reads as
ˆψ(E) =
Z
R
χE(x)†ψ(x)dx
for all
E ∈R.
The function E →
ˆψ(E) is called the energetic Fourier transform of the
Schr¨odinger wave function x →ψ(x) in the position space.
(ii) The inverse energetic Fourier transform: By the energetic completeness relation
(E2),
⟨x|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩dµ(E).
This means that
ψ(x) =
Z
R
χE(x) ˆψ(E)dµ(E)
for all
x ∈R.
(iii) The Parseval equation for the inner product: By the energetic completeness
relation (E2),
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ϕ|E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩dµ(E).
This tells us that for all states |ϕ⟩and |ψ⟩,
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†ψ(x)dx =
Z
R
ˆϕ(E)† ˆψ(E)dµ(E).

604
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
(iv) Energetic eigencostates: For all states ψ and all E ∈R,
⟨E|H|ψ⟩= E⟨E|ψ⟩.
We say that ⟨E| is an eigencostate of the energy operator H to the energy value
E. In fact, by the completeness relation (E2),
⟨E|H|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨E|H|E′⟩⟨E′|ψ⟩dµ(E′)
=
Z
R
Eδµ(E, E′)⟨E′|ψ⟩dµ(E′) = E⟨E|ψ⟩.
(v) Generalized energetic eigenstates: For all E ∈R, we get
H|E⟩= E|E⟩.
We say that |E⟩is a generalized energetic eigenstate with the eigenvalue E. To
motivate this, note that by the completeness relation (E2),
H|E⟩=
Z
R
|E′⟩⟨E′|H|E⟩dµ(E′) =
Z
R
E′δµ(E′, E)|E′⟩dµ(E′) = E|E⟩.
(vi) Functions of the energy operator: Let k = 1, 2, . . . . For all E ∈R, we have
Hk|E⟩= Ek|E⟩.
In fact, H2|E⟩= H(H|E⟩) = H(E|E⟩) = E(H|E⟩) = E2|E⟩, and so on.
This motivates the following deﬁnition. Let f : R →C be a polynomial or an
analytic function. For all E ∈R, we set
f(H)|E⟩:= f(E)|E⟩.
(iv) Transition amplitudes: For all states |ϕ⟩and |ψ⟩,
⟨ϕ|f(H)|ψ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ϕ|E⟩f(E)⟨E|ψ⟩dµ(E).
Equivalently,
⟨ϕ|f(H)|ψ⟩=
Z
R
ˆϕ(E)†f(E) ˆψ(E)dµ(E).
In fact, by the completeness relation (E2),
⟨ϕ|f(H)|ψ⟩=
Z
R
dµ(E′)
Z
R
dµ(E)⟨ϕ|E′⟩⟨E′|f(H)E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩
=
Z
R
dµ(E′)
Z
R
dµ(E)f(E)⟨ϕ|E′⟩⟨E′|E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩
=
Z
R
dµ(E)f(E)⟨ϕ|E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩.

11.2 Dirac’s Formal Approach
605
(v) Dynamics of a quantum particle: Let |ψ(t)⟩be the state of the quantum particle
on the real line at the time t. We postulate that
|ψ(t)⟩= e−itH/ℏ|ψ(0)⟩
for all
t ∈R.
(11.35)
Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏd
dt|ψ(t)⟩= H|ψ(t)⟩
for all
t ∈R.
By the completeness relation in the position state, it follows from (11.35) that
⟨x|ψ(t)⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|e−itH/ℏ|y⟩⟨y|ψ(0)⟩dy
(11.36)
for all positions x ∈R and all times t ∈R. Setting ψ(x, t) := ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩and
introducing the so-called propagator kernel,
P(x, y; t) := ⟨x|e−itH/ℏ|y⟩,
equation (11.36) reads as
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
P(x, y; t)ψ(y, 0)dy
for all
x, t ∈R.
Introducing the so-called retarded propagator kernel (or Feynman propagator
kernel)
P+(x, y; t) := θ(t)P(x, y; t),
x, y, t ∈R,
then
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
P+(x, y; t)ψ(y,0)dy
for all
x ∈R, t > 0.
Observables. Let A ∈R. If we replace H, |E⟩, ⟨E| by A, |A⟩, ⟨A|, respectively,
then we get the Dirac calculus with respect to the observable A. Special observables
are energy H, position X, and momentum P.
In terms of this general approach, the spectral measure of both the position
operator X and the momentum operator P is the Lebesgue measure on the real
line. This measure is characterized by the fact that it is invariant under translations.
In fact, the relation
„ d
dxψ
«
(x) = lim
ε→+0
ψ(x + ε) −ψ(x)
ε
shows that the diﬀerential operator
d
dx represents the inﬁnitesimal operator of the
group of all translations, x →x + ε, on the real line. For the momentum operator,
we obtain
P := −iℏd
dx
on the position state. Therefore, it is quite natural that the translation-invariant
Lebesgue measure represents the spectral measure of the momentum operator P.

11.2.6 Formal Construction of the Heat Kernel
We want to show how the Dirac calculus can be used in order to motivate the heat
kernel formulas discussed on page 586. Set P := −iℏ∂with ℏ= 1. Hence
P2 = −∂2 = ∆.
Generalizing the one-dimensional Dirac calculus above, we will use the following
key formulas:
• ⟨x|y⟩= δ3(x −y);
• ⟨x|p⟩= eipx/(2π)
3
2 ;
•
R
R3 |x⟩⟨x| d3x = I;
•

R3 |p⟩⟨p| d3p = I;
• P|p⟩= p |p⟩.
The homogeneous heat equation. Let us prove the solution formula (11.9)
for the homogeneous heat equation (11.8) on page 586. In fact, the initial-value
problem (11.8),
˙ψ(t) = −κP2ψ(t),
t > 0,
ψ(0) = ψ0
has the solution
ψ(t) = e−κtP2ψ0,
t > 0.
By the completeness relation
R
R3 |y⟩⟨y| d3y = I,
⟨x|ψ(t)⟩=
Z
R3⟨x|e−κtP2|y⟩⟨y|ψ0⟩d3y.
(11.37)
Since P|p⟩= p|p⟩, we get the crucial eigensolutions
e−κtP2|p⟩= e−κtp2|p⟩.
Let x, y ∈R3 and t > 0. Introducing the heat kernel
K(x, t; y, 0) := ⟨x|e−κtP2|y⟩,
the completeness relation
R
R3 |p⟩⟨p| d3p = I yields
K(x, t; y, 0) =

R3⟨x|e−κtP2|p⟩⟨p|y⟩d3p

11.3.1 Physical Measurements and the Idea of Averaging
Our measurement instruments measure only averages. The theory of distributions
is based on diﬀerent methods of averaging by using diﬀerent types of test functions.
For example, we can replace the mass density function ϱ = ϱ(x, t) by the average
ϱ[ϕ] =
Z
R3 ϱ(x, t)ϕ(x)d3x
(11.39)
where the test function ϕ : R3 →C is smooth and vanishes outside some ball. The
average ϱ[ϕ] depends on the choice of the function ϕ. Dirac’s relation
Z
R3 δ3(x −x0)ϕ(x)d3x = ϕ(x0)
(11.40)
does not make any sense in classical analysis. However, we can deﬁne
δx0(ϕ) := ϕ(x0)
for all test functions ϕ. The map ϕ →δx0(ϕ) describes a mass m = 1 at the point
x0. Formula (11.40) serves as a very useful mnemonic tool.
The strategy of the theory of distributions is to reformulate classical prop-
erties in terms of averages of type (11.39) and then to generalize this to
functionals ϕ →F(ϕ).
In quantum ﬁeld theory, the method of averaging allows us to handle strong singu-
larities in a reasonable way.

11.3.2 Distributions
Let N = 1, 2, . . .. We will study complex-valued functions
f : RN →C
and generalizations of such functions called generalized functions or distributions.
The real components of the point x in RN are denoted by x1, . . . , xN. We will use
the notation introduced on page 536. In particular we write
∂α := ∂α1
1 ∂α2
2
· · · ∂αN
N
along with the partial derivative ∂j := ∂/∂xj and α = (α1, . . . , αN).
The support of a function. Let f : RN →C be an arbitrary function. By
deﬁnition, the zero set, zero(f), is the maximal open subset of RN on which the
function f vanishes. The complement is called the support of f,
supp(f) := RN \ zero(f).
The support of a function is always a closed set. In particular, for the Heaviside
function θ : R →R,
supp(θ) = [0, ∞[.
The function, f(x) := sin x vanishes precisely at the points x = 0, ±π, ±2π, . . . .
The support of this function is a closed set, and hence it equals the real line.
The space D(RN) of test functions. Let N = 1, 2, . . . By deﬁnition, the
space D(RN) consists of all smooth functions
ϕ : RN →C
which have compact support.16 Let ϕn, ϕ ∈D(RN) for all n. We write
lim
n→∞ϕn = ϕ
in D(RN)
iﬀthere exists a compact subset B of RN such that
• supp(ϕn) ⊆B for all n;
• limn→∞supx∈B |ϕn(x) −ϕ(x)| = 0;
• limn→∞supx∈B |∂αϕn(x) −∂αϕ(x)| = 0 for all possible derivatives ∂α.
The space D′(RN) of distributions. By deﬁnition, a distribution is a linear,
sequentially continuous map
F : D(RN) →C.
Explicitly, we assign a complex number F(ϕ) to each test function ϕ in the space
D(RN). Moreover, for all ϕ, ψ ∈D(RN) and all complex numbers α, β,
F(αϕ + βψ) = αF(ϕ) + βF(ψ).
Finally, limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in D(RN) always implies
16 Recall that a subset of RN is compact iﬀit is bounded and closed (e.g., a closed
ball). For example, the smooth function ϕ : R →R lies in D(R) iﬀit vanishes
outside some ﬁnite interval.

11.3 Laurent Schwartz’s Rigorous Approach

lim
n→∞F(ϕn) = F(ϕ).
The space of all such distributions is denoted by D′(RN).
The Dirac delta distribution. Deﬁne
δ[ϕ] := ϕ(0)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Then, δ is a distribution living in D′(RN). In fact, for all ϕ, ψ ∈D(RN) and all
complex numbers α and β,
δ[αϕ + βψ] = αϕ(0) + βϕ(0) = αδ[ϕ] + βδ[ψ].
Moreover, limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in D(RN) implies limn→∞ϕn(0) = ϕ(0), and hence
lim
n→∞δ[ϕn] = δ[ϕ].
Furthermore, for each ﬁxed point x0 ∈RN, we deﬁne
δx0[ϕ] := ϕ(x0)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
This distribution, δx0 ∈D′(RN), is called the Dirac delta distribution at the point
x0.
Classical functions as distributions. The key formula reads as
f[ϕ] :=
Z
RN f(x)ϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Let Lloc(RN) be the space of all locally integrable functions f : RN →C, that is,
the Lebesgue integral
R
B f(x)dNx exists for all compact subsets B of RN.17 Then,
the map ϕ →f[ϕ] is a distribution which lies in the space D′(RN). We brieﬂy write
f ∈D′(RN).
In this sense, we also write Lloc(RN) ⊂D′(RN). Suppose that we are given functions
f, g ∈Lloc(RN) such that
f[ϕ] = g[ϕ]
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Then, f(x) = g(x) for almost all x ∈RN, in the sense of the N-dimensional
Lebesgue measure. In particular, if f, g : RN →C are continuous, then f = g on
RN. For example, the Heaviside function θ : R →R corresponds to the distribution
θ[ϕ] =
Z
R
θ(x)ϕ(x)dx =
Z ∞
0
ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ ∈D(R).
Convention. In what follows, we say that the distribution F ∈D′(RN) is a
classical function iﬀthere exists a function f : RN →C living in the space Lloc(RN)
such that
17 For example, the function f is continuous (or almost everywhere continuous and
bounded on bounded sets).

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
F(ϕ) =
Z
RN f(x)ϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
To simplify notation, we also write f instead of F.
The product between classical functions and distributions. Let the
function χ : RN →C be smooth. Then, for all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN), the prod-
uct function χϕ also lies in the space D(RN) of test functions. For given distribution
F ∈D′(RN), we deﬁne the product χF by setting
(χF)(ϕ) := F(χϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Then, χF is a distribution living in D′(RN). For example, χδ is given by
(χδ)(ϕ) = χ(0)ϕ(0)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
The support of a distribution. Let Ωbe an open subset of RN. For a
distribution F ∈D′(RN), we write
F = 0
on Ω
iﬀF(ϕ) = 0 for all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN) with supp(ϕ) ⊆Ω. By deﬁnition, the
set zero(F) is the maximal open subset of RN such that F = 0 on this set. The
complement
supp(F) := RN \ zero(F)
is called the support of the distribution F. For example, the Dirac delta distribution
δ has the origin as support, and
supp(δx0) = {x0}.
Derivative of a distribution. Let f : RN →C be a smooth function. Inte-
gration by parts yields
Z
RN ∂αf(x)ϕ(x)dNx = (−1)|α|
Z
RN f(x)∂αϕ(x)dNx
for all ϕ ∈D(RN). This motivates the following deﬁnition. We are given the distri-
bution F ∈D′(RN). The derivative ∂αF is deﬁned by
(∂αF)(ϕ) := (−1)|α|F(∂αϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
This is a distribution living in D′(RN). Note that
Each distribution has derivatives of all orders.
In particular, each function f ∈Lloc(RN) has derivatives of each order in the sense
of distributions. Explicitly,
∂αf[ϕ] = (−1)|α|
Z
RN f(x)∂αϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
For the Dirac delta distribution, the derivative ∂αδx0 is given by
(∂αδx0)(ϕ) = (−1)|α|∂αϕ(x0)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Typical examples. The following derivatives of distributions are used fre-
quently.

11.3 Laurent Schwartz’s Rigorous Approach

(i) For the Heaviside function θ : R →R,
θ′ = δ
on
R.
In fact, for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R), integration by parts yields
Z
R
−θ(t)ϕ′(t)dt =
Z ∞
0
−ϕ′(t)dt = ϕ(0).
Hence θ[−ϕ′] = ϕ(0) = δ[ϕ] for all ϕ ∈D(R).
(ii) Fix the complex number a and set f(t) := θ(t)eat for all t ∈R. Then
f ′ = af + δ

R.
To prove this, note that integration by parts yields
Z
R
θ(t)eat(−ϕ′(t))dt = −
Z ∞

eatϕ(t)dt + ϕ(0).
Hence f[−ϕ′] = af[ϕ] + δ[ϕ] for all ϕ ∈D(R).18
(iii) Set g(t) := θ(t)t for all t ∈R. Then
g′′ = δ
on
R.
(11.41)
In fact, integration by parts tells us that
g[−ϕ′] =
Z ∞
0
−tϕ′(t)dt =
Z ∞

ϕ(t)dt = θ[ϕ].
Hence g′ = θ on R. By (i), g′′ = θ′ = δ, as claimed above.19
(iv) Suppose that the distribution F ∈D′(RN) satisﬁes the equation20
∂jF = 0
on
RN,
j = 1, . . . , N.
Then, F is a constant classical function. Explicitly,
F(ϕ) = const
Z
RN ϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
(11.42)
(v) The Weyl lemma: Fix the complex number a. If the distribution F ∈D′(RN)
satisﬁes the equation
∆F + aF = 0
on
RN,
then F is a classical smooth function on RN.
The Sobolev space W k
2 (RN). Let k = 1, 2, . . . By deﬁnition, the space
W k
2 (RN) consists of all functions f ∈L2(RN) such that
∂αf ∈L2(RN)
for all α with |α| ≤k.
Explicitly, there exist functions gα living in L2(RN) such that
18 Formally, f ′(t) = θ′(t)eat + θ(t)aeat = δ(t)eat + af(t) = δ(t)e0 + af(t).
19 Formally, g′(t) = δ(t)t + θ(t) = θ(t). Hence g′′(t) = θ′(t) = δ(t).
20 The proof of (iv) and (v) can be found in H¨ormander (1983), Vol. 1, Sect. 3.1
and Zeidler (1986), Vol. IIA, Sect. 18.15, respectively.

Limit of distributions. Let Fn, F ∈D′(RN) for all n. We write

(11.43)
iﬀlimn→∞Fn(ϕ) = F(ϕ) for all ϕ ∈D(RN).
Proposition 11.10 For all derivatives ∂α, it follows from (11.43) that

n→∞∂αFn = ∂αF.
For each continuous function ψ : RN →C, there exists a sequence (pn) of

Consequently, limn→∞pn = ψ in D′(RN).
Application to the vibrating string. Fix c > 0. Let f, g : R →R be smooth
functions. Then, the function

x, t ∈R

ψtt(x, t)
c2
−ψxx(x, t) = 0,
(x, t) ∈R2.
(11.44)
If f, g : R →R are continuous, then the function ψ describes a vibrating string (su-
perposition of two waves propagating with the speed c to right and to left, respec-
tively). Thus, the function ψ possesses a well-deﬁned physical meaning. However,
as a rule, ψ is not a classical solution of the wave equation because of a lack of
smoothness. However, the following hold true.
Proposition 11.11 If f, g : R →R are continuous, then ψ solves the wave equa-
tion in the sense of distributions in D′(R2).

This proof shows that the theory of distributions can be used in order to con-

Propagation of singularities. The function
ψ(x, t) := θ(x −ct),
(x, t) ∈R2
(11.45)
is a solution of the wave equation (11.44) in the sense of distributions in the space
D′(R2).
Proof. For ﬁxed ∆t > 0, choose the continuous function θ∆t : R →R as pictured
in Fig. 11.1 on page 577. By Prop. 11.11, the function ψ∆t(x, t) := θ∆t(x −ct)
satisﬁes the wave equation, that is,
Z
R2 θ∆t(x −ct)

dxdt = 0.

The solution ψ from (11.45) can be regarded as the propagation of a mass
density ψ on the real line with velocity c. The jump of mass density at the point
x = ct at time t represents a simpliﬁed model for a shock wave in gas dynamics
(Fig. 11.3). For example, supersonic aircrafts generate strongly audible shock waves
in air. Shock waves are studied in the the standard textbook by Smoller (1994).
The propagation of singularities at the speed of light is typical for quantum
ﬁeld theory.

Nonlinear transformation of the Dirac delta distribution. We are given
the smooth function f : RN →RN which has precisely the zeros x1, . . . , xn. In
addition, we assume that the zeros are non-degenerate, that is, det f ′(xj) ̸= 0 for
j = 1, . . . , n. We deﬁne21
δ ◦f :=
n
X
j=1

| det f ′(xj)|.
Then, δ ◦f is a distribution living in D′(RN).
The space D′(Ω). Let Ωbe a nonempty open subset of RN. Replacing RN by
Ω, all of the considerations above can be generalized immediately to the set Ω. In
particular, the space D(Ω) of test functions consists of all smooth functions
ϕ : Ω→RN
which have compact support.22 Furthermore, the space of distributions D′(Ω) con-
sists of all linear, sequentially continuous maps
F : D(Ω) →C.
Such distributions generalize functions of the form f : Ω→C.
The Sobolev space W k
2 (RN) is replaced by W k
2 (Ω). Here, we have to replace
R
RN by
R
Ωabove.
The space E ′(RN). By deﬁnition, the space E(RN) consists of all smooth
functions ϕ : RN →C. Let ϕn, ϕ ∈E(RN) for all n. As n →∞, we write
ϕn →ϕ
in E(RN)
iﬀϕn (resp. every derivative ∂αϕn) converges uniformly to ϕ (resp. to ∂αϕ) on
each compact subset of RN. By deﬁnition, the space E ′(RN) consists of all linear,
sequentially continuous functionals
F : E(RN) →C.
One can show that the space E′(RN) coincides with a linear subspace of D(RN),
namely, the space of distributions with compact support. We have the inclusions
D(RN) ⊂S(RN) ⊂E(RN) ⊂E ′(RN) ⊂S′(RN) ⊂D′(RN).
11.3.3 Tempered Distributions
Let us now introduce a subclass of distributions which are called tempered distri-
butions and which play a crucial role for the Fourier transform. The deﬁnition of
the space S(RN) of rapidly decreasing functions
ϕ : RN →C
21 This deﬁnition is motivated by the heuristic formula (11.25) for δ(f(x)).
22 The symbol C∞(Ω) denotes the space of smooth functions ϕ : Ω→R. The space
D(Ω) is also denoted by C∞
0 (Ω) in the literature.

11.3 Laurent Schwartz’s Rigorous Approach
615
along with the appropriate notion of convergence can be found in Sect. 10.3.3
on page 535. By a tempered distribution on RN, we mean a linear, sequentially
continuous map
F : S(RN) →C.
Explicitly, we assign a complex number F(ϕ) to each test function ϕ in S(RN).
Moreover, for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(RN) and all complex numbers α, β,
F(αϕ + βψ) = αF(ϕ) + βF(ψ).
Finally, limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in S(RN) always implies
lim
n→∞F(ϕn) = F(ϕ).
The space of all such distributions is denoted by S′(RN). In particular, ﬁx the point
x0 in RN, and set
δx0(ϕ) := ϕ(x0)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
This tempered distribution is called the tempered Dirac distribution. Note that
D(RN) ⊂S(RN) and that the convergence in D(RN) implies the convergence in
S(RN). Consequently, each tempered distribution is also a distribution, that is,
S′(RN) ⊂D′(RN).
Let us now summarize some classes of functions which are tempered distributions.
To this end, set
f[ϕ] :=
Z
RN f(x)ϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN)
where the function f : RN →C is given.
Proposition 11.12 The functional ϕ →f[ϕ] is a tempered distribution on RN if
one of the following two conditions is satisﬁed.
(i) The function f is either a polynomial or f ∈L2(RN).
(ii) The function f ∈Lloc(RN) is of moderate growth at inﬁnity. Explicitly,
there exists a nonnegative integer m such that
|f(x)| = O(||x||m),
||x|| →∞.
The proof can be found in Problem 12.7. Finally, we deﬁne the product xαF by
setting
(xαF)(ϕ) := F(χϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN)
where we set χ(x) := xα = (x1)α1(x2)α2 · · · (xN)αN for all x ∈RN. If F is a
tempered distribution on RN, then so is xαF.
The tensor product of distributions. Let N, M = 1, 2, . . . . For given func-
tions ϕ ∈D(RN) and ψ ∈D(RM), we deﬁne the tensor product ϕ ⊗ψ by setting
(ϕ ⊗ψ)(x, y) := ϕ(x)ψ(y)
for all
x, y ∈RN+M.
If f ∈Lloc(RN) and g ∈Lloc(RM), then

Z
RM+N f(x)g(y)ϕ(x)ψ(y)dNxdMy =
Z
RN f(x)ϕ(x)dNx

Furthermore, for all test functions χ ∈D(RN+M),
Z
RM+N f(x)g(y)χ(x,y)dNxdMy =
Z
RM
„Z
RN f(x)χ(x, y)dNx
«
g(y)dMy.
This motivates the following deﬁnition of the tensor product of two distributions.
Proposition 11.13 For given distributions F ∈D′(RN) and G ∈D′(RM), there
exists precisely one distribution T ∈D′(RN+M) such that
T (ϕ ⊗ψ) = F(ϕ)G(ψ)
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN), ψ ∈D(RM).
If F and G are tempered distributions, then so is T.
We write T = F ⊗G and call this the tensor product between F and G. The
proof can be found in Triebel (1989), Sect. 13. Furthermore, for all test functions
χ ∈D(RN+M),
(F ⊗G)(χ) = G(F(χ)).
This means that, we ﬁrst apply F to the test function x →χ(x, y) for ﬁxed y ∈RM,
and we then apply G to the test function y →F(χ(., y)).
The convolution of distributions. Recall that the function f ∗g given by
(f ∗g)(x) :=
Z
RN f(x −y)g(y)dNy
for all
x ∈RN
is called the convolution between f and g. The convolution makes sense if one of
the following two conditions is satisﬁed:23
(a) The functions f, g : RN →C are continuous and g has compact support.
(b) f, g ∈S(RN).
Using the substitution z = x −y, for each test function χ ∈D(RN) we get
Z
RN (f ∗g)(x)χ(x)dNx =
Z
RN f(x)
„Z
RN g(y)χ(x + y)dNy
«
dNx.
This motivates the deﬁnition
(F ∗G)(χ) := F{G(χ(x + ...))}
for all
χ ∈D(RN).
This means that we ﬁrst apply G to the test function y →χ(x + y) for ﬁxed x ∈R,
and we then apply F to the test function24 x →G(χ(x + ...)). The proof of the
following theorem can be found in Triebel (1989), Sect. 13.
Theorem 11.14 We are given the distributions F, G ∈D′(RN) where G has com-
pact support. Then:
(i) F ∗G ∈D′(RN).
(ii) ∂α(F ∗G) = ∂αF ∗G = F ∗∂αG for all derivatives.
(iii) If F has compact support, then F ∗G = G ∗F. In particular, we obtain
F ∗δ = δ ∗F.
(iv) If F ∈S′(RN), then F ∗G ∈S′(RN).
23 Properties of the classical convolution can be found on page 537.
24 The symbol χ(x + ...) stands for the function y →χ(x + y).

11.3.4 The Fourier Transform
Recall from Sect. 10.3.3 on page 535 that the Fourier transform
F : S(RN) →S(RN)
is linear, bijective, and sequentially continuous. For all functions g, ϕ in S(RN), we
have the identity
Z
RN (Fg)(x)ϕ(x)dNx =
Z
RN g(x)(Fϕ)(x)dNx.
This motivates the following deﬁnition. For each tempered distribution G ∈S′(RN),
we deﬁne the Fourier transform FG by setting
(FG)(ϕ) := G(Fϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
(11.46)
It can be shown that FG is a tempered distribution. The map
F : S′(RN) →S′(RN)
is linear, bijective, and sequentially continuous.25 In addition, for the inverse map
F(G) →G, we get
G(ϕ) = (FG)(F−1ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
The Fourier transform has the following properties:
(P1) Fδ = (2π)−N/2.
(P2) Fδx0 = χx0 where χx0(x) := (2π)−N/2e−i⟨x0|x⟩for all x ∈RN.
(P3) F(∂αG) = i|α|xαFG for all derivatives.
To prove this, choose an arbitrary test function ϕ ∈S(RN). Obviously, (P1) is a
special case of (P2). In order to prove (P2), note that
(Fδx0)(ϕ) = δx0(Fϕ) = (Fϕ)(x0) =
Z
RN (2π)−N/2e−i⟨x0|x⟩ϕ(x)dNx.
The derivative rule (P3) follows from
∂α
Z
RN e−i⟨p|x⟩ϕ(p)dNp =
Z
RN e−i⟨p|x⟩(−i)|α|pαϕ(p) dNp
along with
F(∂αG)(ϕ) = ∂αG(Fϕ) = (−1)|α|G(∂αFϕ)
= G(F(i|α|xαϕ)) = (FG)(i|α|xαϕ) = i|α|(xαFG)(ϕ).
Let f ∈L2(RN). If we regard the function f as tempered distribution, then the
Fourier transform Ff is a well-deﬁned tempered distribution. It turns out that Ff
represents a function which lies in the space L2(RN). More generally, the following
hold true.
Theorem 11.15 The Fourier transform F : L2(RN) →L2(RN) is a unitary trans-
formation on the Hilbert space L2(RN).
For the proof, see Triebel (1989), p. 109.
25 The proof can be found in Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 3.8.

11.4 Hadamard’s Regularization of Integrals
As a rule, the Green’s functions for hyperbolic diﬀerential equations possess strong
singularities. In order to represent such Green’s functions by integral formulas,
Hadamard (1865–1963) introduced the notion of the ﬁnite part of a divergent inte-
gral.26
11.4.1 Regularization of Divergent Integrals
In order to discuss the basic idea, choose the function ϕ ∈D(R). The integral
J(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)dx
x
is convergent if ϕ(0) = 0 and divergent if ϕ(0) ̸= 0. By deﬁnition, the regularization
of this integral is given by
Jreg(ϕ) =
Z
R
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0)
x
dx
for all functions ϕ ∈D(R). The additional term −ϕ(0)
x
is called regularizing term.
We will also use the notation
Jreg = P
„ 1
x
«
.
The following are met:
(i) The regularized functional, Jreg, is a distribution on R.
(ii) For all test functions ϕ ∈D(R),
Jreg(ϕ) = PV
Z
R
ϕ(x)
x
dx.
As usual, the symbol PV stands for Cauchy’s principal value of the integral. This
is deﬁned by the following limit
PV
Z
R
ϕ(x)
x
dx = lim
ε→+0
„Z −ε
−∞
ϕ(x)
x
dx +
Z ∞

ϕ(x)
x
dx
«
.
Proof. Ad (i). If ϕn →ϕ in S(R) as n →∞, then Jreg(ϕn) →Jreg(ϕ).
Ad (ii). Choose ε > 0. Since the following integrand is odd,
Z −ε
−∞
ϕ(0)
x
dx +
Z ∞
ε
ϕ(0)
x
dx = 0.
Finally, choose the following decomposition
ϕ(x)
x
= ϕ(x) −ϕ(0)
x
+ ϕ(0)
x
.
2
Note that if the integral J(ϕ) is convergent, then Jreg(ϕ) = J(ϕ). However, if
the integral J(ϕ) is divergent, then the well-deﬁned integral Jreg(ϕ) is called the
ﬁnite part of J(ϕ), in the sense of Hadamard.

11.4.2 The Sokhotski Formula
The classical function
f(x) := 1
x
for all
x ∈R \ {0}
has a singularity at the point x = 0. There exist three diﬀerent distributions which
can be regarded as regularizations of this singular function, namely,
P
„ 1
x
«
,
1
x + 0+i,
1
x −0+i.
To discuss this, let z be a ﬁxed, but otherwise arbitrary complex number. For each
test function ϕ ∈D(R), deﬁne
P
„
1
x −z
«
(ϕ) := PV
Z
R
ϕ(x)dx
x −z .
This is a distribution living in D′(R). If the parameter z is not real, then the integral
exists in the classical sense. If z is a real number, then it follows as in the preceding
section that
P
„
1
x −z
«
(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(y + z) −ϕ(z)
y
dy.
Choose z := ∓εi with ε > 0.
Theorem 11.16 For every test function ϕ ∈D(R), we have the classical Sokhotski
formula
lim
ε→+0 P
„
1
x ± εi
«
(ϕ) = P
„ 1
x
«
∓iπϕ(0).
(11.47)
Proof. We have to show that for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R),
lim
ε→+0
Z ∞
−∞
ϕ(x)dx
x + εi = −iπϕ(0) +
Z ∞
−∞
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0)

The key to this limit is the identity
Z R
−R

x + εi =
Z R
−R
x −εi
x2 + ε2 dx
= −
Z R
−R
εi
x2 + ε2 dx = −2i arctan R
ε
which converges to −iπ as ε →+0. Since the test function ϕ has compact support,
there exists an interval [−R, R] such that ϕ vanishes outside this interval. Therefore,
it remains to use the decomposition
Z R
−R
ϕ(x)dx
x + εi =
Z R
−R
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0)
x + εi
dx + ϕ(0)
Z R
−R
dx
x + εi,
and to perform the limit ε →+0.
2
Let us translate this into the language of distributions. The Sokhotski formula
tells us that

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions

„

x ± εi

„ 1

∓iπδ,
in the sense of distributions. This is called an adiabatic limit. We now deﬁne the
distribution
1
x + 0+i := P
„ 1
x
«
−iπδ.
(11.48)
Similarly, we deﬁne the distribution
1
x −0+i := P
„ 1
x
«
+ iπδ.
If ℑ(z) ̸= 0, then
P
„
1
x −z
«
(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)dx
x −z
where the integral exists in the classical sense. According to the usual identiﬁcation
between functions and the corresponding distributions, we write
P
„
1
x −z
«
=
1
x −z
if ℑ(z) ̸= 0.
Thus, in the sense of distributions,
1
x ± 0+i = lim
ε→+0
1
x ± εi.
The considerations above remain valid if the test functions ϕ lie in the space
S(R). Thus,
1
x+0+i and
1
x−0+i are also tempered distributions.
11.4.3 Steinmann’s Renormalization Theorem
The quest for the existence of a non-trivial quantum ﬁeld in four space-
time dimensions is still without any conclusive result. Nonetheless, physi-
cists are working daily, with success, on concrete models which describe
very eﬃciently physics at wide energy scales. This description is based
on expansion of physical quantities like amplitudes of scattering processes
of power series of “physical” parameters, as coupling constants, masses,
charges. The higher order terms of these power series are usually ill-
deﬁned, in a naive approach, but physicists have soon learned how to make
sense of them through the procedure now known as renormalization. . . On
Minkowski space-time, Steinmann’s concept of the scaling degree of a gen-
eralized function at a point leads to a rather smooth and economic method
of renormalization. . .

The support theorem. Let c0, . . . , cm be complex numbers. Set
F = c0δ + c1δ′ + c2δ′′ + . . . + cmδ(m).
(11.49)
Then, the distribution F has the origin as support (or it vanishes identically).
Interestingly enough, the converse is also true. The proof of the following theorem
can be found in Triebel (1989), Sect. 4.
Theorem 11.17 If the distribution F ∈D′(RN) has the origin as support, then it
has the form (11.49).
The local degree of homogeneity of a distribution. Let σ0 be a real
number. The function f : RN →C is said to be homogeneous of order σ0 iﬀ
f(λx) = λσ0f(x)
for all
x ∈RN, x ̸= 0, λ > 0.
(11.50)
For example, if N = 1, then the functions f(x) := x, x2, x−1, x−2 are homogeneous
of order (or degree) σ0 = 1, 2, −1 −2, respectively. We write
degh f := σ0.
We want to generalize this notion to distributions. Let λ > 0. Suppose ﬁrst that the
function f is locally integrable along with (11.50). For all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN),
we then have the two identities
λ−σ
Z
RN f(λy)ϕ(y)dNy = λσ0−σ
Z
RN f(y)ϕ(y)dNy,
and
Z
RN f(λy)ϕ(y)dNy =
Z
RN f(x)λ−Nϕ(λ−1x)dNx,
by the substitution x := λy. Now consider a general distribution F ∈D′(RN). Set
(Sλϕ)(x) := λ−Nϕ(λ−1x)
for all
x ∈RN, λ > 0.
Suppose that there exists a real number σ such that
lim
λ→+0 λ−σF(Sλϕ) = 0
for all
ϕ ∈D(RN).
Let σ0 be the supremum of all such numbers σ. We then write σ0 = degh F, and we
call this the local degree of homogeneity of the distribution F. If there is no such
real number σ, we set degh F := −∞. Therefore, each distribution F ∈D′(RN) has
a local degree of homogeneity, and
−∞≤degh F ≤+∞.
Let us consider some typical examples.
(i) Homogeneous distribution: Suppose that there exists a real number σ0 such
that
F(Sλϕ) = λσ0F(ϕ)
for all
λ > 0
and all test functions ϕ ∈D(RN). Then σ0 = deg F.

622
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
(ii) Dirac’s delta distribution δ on RN: For all λ > 0 and ϕ ∈D(RN),
δ(Sλϕ) = (Sλϕ)(0) = λ−Nϕ(0) = λ−Nδ(ϕ).
Hence degh δ = −N.
Steinmann’s renormalization theorem for distributions. We are given a
distribution
F0 ∈D′(RN \ {0})
with ﬁnite local degree of homogeneity, degh F0. 28 By an admissible extension of
F0, we mean a distribution
F ∈D′(RN)
with F(ϕ) = F0(ϕ) for all ϕ ∈D(RN \ {0}), and degh F = degh F0. The following
theorem is basic for renormalization theory.
Theorem 11.18 Each distribution F0 above has an admissible extension F. If
degh F0 > −N, then the admissible extension of F0 is unique.
If degh F0 ≤−N, then the family of all admissible extensions of F0 depends on
a ﬁnite number of complex parameters.
More precisely, in the critical case where degh F0 ≤−N, suppose that the degree
degh F0 is an integer. Then the set of all admissible extensions of F0 is given by
F +
X
|α|≤m
cα∂αδ
where F is a ﬁxed admissible extension, and m = −N −degh F0. In addition, cα are
arbitrary complex numbers. The admissible extensions are also called Steinmann
extensions. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the free parameters cα have to be determined
by additional symmetry conditions (e.g., Ward–Takehashi identities). This is the
method of renormalization. The proof of Theorem 11.18 will be given in Volume II
in connection with the Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum ﬁeld theory.29 Let us
consider a typical application.
11.4.4 Regularization Terms
Modern functional analysis solves classical problems in a generalized set-
ting by extending function spaces, operators, and functionals to more gen-
eral objects. For example, this concerns variational problems, the partial
diﬀerential equations of mathematical physics, and optimization problems.
The key words for typical extensions are Sobolev spaces, the Friedrichs ex-
tension of a formally self-adjoint operator, the Hahn–Banach extension of
functionals, and the Steinmann extension of distributions.30

28 This degree is deﬁned as above by restricting the test functions ϕ to the space
D(RN \ {0}).
29 See also Steinmann (1971), and Brunetti, Fredenhagen (2000).

tional Analysis, Vols. 1, 2, Springer, New York, 1995.

11.4 Hadamard’s Regularization of Integrals
623
Consider the integral
F0(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)
x
dx.
If we restrict ourselves to smooth test functions ϕ : R \ {0} →C having compact
support, that is, these functions vanish outside a compact subset of the open set
R \ {0}, then ϕ vanishes in some open neighborhood of the origin and outside
some suﬃciently large interval. Consequently, the integral F0(ϕ) is well-deﬁned; it
represents a distribution in the space D′(R \ {0}) with local degree of homogeneity,
degh F0 = −1. By the Steinmann Renormalization Theorem 11.18, we obtain the
following.
Theorem 11.19 The most general extension of the distribution F0 to a distribu-
tion F ∈D′(R) with the same degree of homogeneity, degh F = −1, is given by
F = Jreg + c0δ
where c is an arbitrary complex number.
Explicitly, we obtain the following expression
F(ϕ) =
Z
R
„ϕ(x)
x
−ϕ(0)
x
«
dx + cϕ(0)
for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R).
As next example, consider the divergent integral
Z
R
dx
x2 .
(11.51)
In order to renormalize this integral, we proceed as follows.
(i) We introduce the functional
F0(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)
x
dx
for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R \ {0}). This is a distribution living in the space
D′(R \ {0}). By Taylor expansion,
ϕ(x) = ϕ(0) + ϕ′(0)x + O(x2),
x →0.
Therefore, we construct the regularized integral31
Freg(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0) −ϕ′(0)x
x2
dx
which exists for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R). The distribution Freg living in
D′(R) represents an extension of F0.
31 This integral represents the ﬁnite part of the integral F0(ϕ), in the sense of
Hadamard.

624
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
(iii) The distribution F0 has the local degree of homogeneity, degh F0 = −2. The
most general distribution F ∈D′(R) of local degree of homogeneity −2, which
is an extension of F0, reads as
F = Freg + c0δ + c1δ′
where c0 and c1 are arbitrary complex numbers. Explicitly,
F(ϕ) =
Z
R
ϕ(x) −ϕ(0) −ϕ′(0)x
x2
dx + c0ϕ(0) + c1ϕ′(0)
for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R). Note that also this makes sense for all test
functions ϕ ∈S(R). Consequently, F is not only a distribution on the real line,
but also a tempered distribution.
By deﬁnition, the tempered distribution F is called the regularization of
the divergent integral (11.51).
The philosophy of renormalization. Typically, the process of renormaliza-
tion in physics introduces additional parameters which have to be ﬁxed by addi-
tional considerations, frequently based on physical arguments.
The philosophy is that we extract relevant physical information from given,
possibly ill-deﬁned mathematical objects.
As a typical example, consider the Fourier series
∞
X
p=−∞
ap(ψ)ϕp(x)
with the basis functions ϕp(x) := eipx/
√
2π and the Fourier coeﬃcients
ap(ψ) :=
Z π
−π
ϕp(x)†ψ(x)dx,
p = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
If the 2π-periodic function ψ : R →C is measurable, and
R π
−π |ψ(x)|dx < ∞, then
the Fourier coeﬃcients are well-deﬁned. In contrast to this, the Fourier series is not
always well-deﬁned as a classical convergent series.
The task is to reconstruct the function ψ from its Fourier coeﬃcients.
A nice answer to a special case of this problem is given by the following Fej´er
theorem from 1904.32
Proposition 11.20 Let ψ : R →C be a continuous 2π-periodic function. Introduce
the partial sums
sn(x) :=
n
X
p=−n
ap(ψ)ϕp(x),
x ∈R, n = 0, 1, . . .
Then, the classical limit
ψ(x) = lim
n→∞sn(x)
does not always exist. However, for all x ∈R, we have the convergence
32 The proof can be found in Zorich (2003), Vol. I, p. 538.

625
ψ(x) = lim
N→∞
s0(x) + s1(x) + . . . + sN(x)
N + 1
for the mean averages of the partial sums. In addition, the convergence is uniform
on the real line.
Similarly, it is possible to extract important information from divergent inte-
grals. This fact is used critically in renormalization theory. For the regularization
of divergent integrals, we refer to
• Sect. 8.5.3 on page 511 (counterterms), and
• Sect. 11.6.2 on page 636 (dimensional regularization).
11.5 Renormalization of the Anharmonic Oscillator
Resonances are dangerous for the mathematics of physical systems.
Folklore
11.5.1 Renormalization in a Nutshell
This section should help the reader to understand the basic ideas of renormalization
theory from both the mathematical and physical point of view. We will use a simple
example in order to demonstrate the relation between the critical phenomenon of
resonance of an oscillating system and the renormalization of physical parameters.
Our rigorous approach will be based on the classical methods of bifurcation theory
in nonlinear functional analysis.33 This way, we will also clarify the role of renor-
malized Green’s functions which represent an important tool used by physicists in
renormalization theory.
11.5.2 The Linearized Problem
In nature, oscillating systems play a crucial role. As examples, consider electromag-
netic waves or the periodic motion of planets around the sun. As a rule, the motion
of coupled oscillating systems becomes complicated if resonance occurs, that is, the
diﬀerence between two frequencies becomes small. As a simple model, consider the
motion q = q(t),
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = F(t),
q(0) = q0,
˙q(0) = q1,
(11.52)
of a particle on the real line under the inﬂuence of the smooth external force F.
Here, the angular frequency ω is a ﬁxed positive number. The unique solution is
given by
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + q1
ω sin ωt +
Z t

G(t, τ)F(τ)dτ,

Chap. 8.

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
G(t, τ) := 1
ω sin ω(t −τ),
t, τ ∈R.
Now choose the periodic external force
F(t) := sin αt,
t ∈R
with the ﬁxed angular frequency α > 0. We have to distinguish between the follow-
ing two cases.
(i) Non-resonance. Let α ̸= ω. Then
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + q1
ω sin ωt + sin αt + sin ωt
2(α + ω)ω
−sin αt −sin ωt
2(α −ω)ω
.
If α is near ω, then we speak of the small divisor α −ω.
(ii) Resonance. Let α = ω. The limit α →ω yields
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + q1
ω sin ωt + sin ωt
2ω2
−t
2ω cos ωt.
This is the unique solution of (11.52).
The appearance of the term t cos ωt corresponds to a motion with increasing am-
plitude. In practice, such resonant motions may destroy bridges. From the phys-
ical point of view, for vanishing external force, the system (11.52) possesses the
eigenoscillations
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + q1
ω sin ωt.
Since the external force F(t) := sin ωt has the same angular frequency ω as the
eigenoscillations, the external force ampliﬁes the eigenoscillations. From the math-
ematical point of view, small divisors are responsible for resonance eﬀects.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser showed that resonance
eﬀects can cause chaotic motions of bodies in celestial mechanics (KAM theory).
Chaotic motions of asteroids have been observed by astronomers.34
The following material serves as preparation for renormalization. Let us consider
the boundary-value problem
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = F(t),
q(0) = q(π) = 0
(11.53)
where ω > 0. Let C−
π denote the space of continuous π-periodic odd functions
f : R →R with the norm
∥f∥π := max
0≤t≤π |f(t)|.
We are given the external force F ∈C−
π . We are looking for a solution q ∈C−
π
which is twice continuously diﬀerentiable on the interval [0, π]. Such a solution is
called a classical solution of (11.53).
Eigenoscillations. Consider ﬁrst the case where the external force vanishes,
F ≡0. Problem (11.53) possesses then a nontrivial solution iﬀwe choose ω = k for
some k = 1, 2, . . . . The solution reads as
q(t) = const · sin kt.
To each function q ∈C−
π , we assign the Fourier series

Thirring (1997).

If the function q is smooth, then the Fourier series (11.54) converges to q(t) uni-
formly on the real line. Moreover, all the derivatives q′, q′′, . . . can be computed by
diﬀerentiating the Fourier series (11.54) term by term, and these series converge
uniformly on the real line, by (10.8) on page 533.

Therefore, the series for G converges uniformly for all t, τ ∈R. Hence the Green’s

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
• Step 1: Classical solution: Our proof above shows that the function q = q(t) from
(11.57) is a classical solution of the original problem (11.53) if the given function
F is a ﬁnite Fourier series.
• Step 2: Generalized solution: If F ∈C−
π , then the integral (11.57) is still well-
deﬁned. Since the Green’s function G is continuous, the function q is at least
continuous. Therefore, the function q = q(t) from (11.57) can be regarded as
a generalized solution of the original problem (11.53). It can be shown that
this generalized solution q ∈C−
π satisﬁes the original problem (11.53) in the
sense of distribution theory, that is, the derivatives of q are to be understood as
distributional derivatives.
• Step 3: Regularity of the generalized solution: Standard arguments from the reg-
ularity theory for boundary-value problems of second-order ordinary diﬀerential
equations show that q is indeed a classical solution of (11.53) which has contin-
uous derivatives of second order.
For the functional analytic proof of the statement from step 3, see Problem 12.10.
The proof will be based on the theory of Fredholm operators of index zero in Banach
spaces and the approximation theorem of periodic continuous functions by ﬁnite
Fourier series (the Fej´er theorem).
The procedure from step 1 through step 3 is typical for the modern, func-
tional analytic theory of diﬀerential equations.
The resonance case. Let ω = 1. If problem (11.53) has a solution q, then it
follows from (11.56) that
b1(F) = (ω2 −1)b1(q) = 0.
(11.58)
In terms of physics, the external force F(t) = sin t is in resonance with the
eigenoscillation q(t) = sin t. In this case, the original boundary-value problem
(11.53) has no solution. Observe that the Green’s function G from Prop. 11.21
has a singularity at ω = 1. Suppose that the external force F satisﬁes the reso-
nance condition b1(F) = 0 and that q is a solution of (11.53). Then, by (11.56), the
Fourier coeﬃcients of q satisfy the equation
bk(q) = bk(F)
1 −k2 ,
k = 2, 3, . . .
(11.59)
By (11.58), the Fourier coeﬃcient b1(q) is undetermined.

The following investigations should help the reader to understand the phenomenon
of renormalization for nonlinear oscillations in the resonance case. We will use the
methods of bifurcation theory. Let us study the nonlinear oscillation problem
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = κ q(t)3 + µ sin t,
q(0) = q(π) = 0.
(11.62)
The term µ sin t describes an external periodic force, whereas the nonlinear term
κq(t)3 models self-interaction. We call κ the coupling constant.

positive numbers κ0, µ0 and r0 such that the following hold true.

with Fn(t) := κqn(t)3 + µ sin t. To begin with, let F0(t) = µ sin t. By (11.55),

11.5.4 The Nonlinear Problem, Resonance, and Bifurcation
The resonance case, bifurcation, and renormalization. The situation changes
substantially if we consider the resonance case ω = 1. To simplify notation, let us
set µ = 0, that is, we only study the crucial nonlinear self-interaction. The point is
that in contrast to the non-resonance case, the linearized problem
¨q(t) + q(t) = 0,
q(0) = q(π) = 0
has the nontrivial solution
q(t) = s · sin t
which we call ground state. Here, s is a real parameter. If we switch on the self-
interaction, then we have to study the perturbed solutions
q(t) = s · sin t + h(t)
(11.63)

11.5 Renormalization of the Anharmonic Oscillator
631
of the boundary-value problem
¨q + ω2q = κq3,
q(0) = q(π) = 0
(11.64)
along with
ω = 1 + δω.
Here, both the function h and the real parameter δω depend on the small parameters
s and κ. In terms of physics, the observed angular frequency ω depends not only
on the coupling constant κ, but also on the parameter s of the actual ground state
q = s · sin t + . . . of the system. This serves as a very simple model for the situation
encountered in quantum ﬁeld theory where physicists argue as follows.
• In an experiment, we measure both the coupling constant κ and the characteristic
quantity ω = 1 + δω (e.g., the eﬀective mass and the eﬀective electric charge of
an electron).
• The knowledge of κ and ω determines the parameter s. This way, we get the
ground state (11.63).
• Physicists call ω = 1 + δω the renormalization of the bare quantity ω = 1.
In terms of mathematics, we get a family of solutions q, 1 + δω depending on the
small coupling constant κ and an additional small parameter s. In fact, there exist
positive numbers κ0, s0, ε0 and r0 such that the following hold true.
Proposition 11.25 For given real parameters κ and s with |κ| ≤κ0 and |s| ≤s0,
there exists a unique solution q ∈C−
π , ω ∈R of (11.64) with
∥q∥π ≤r0,
b1(q) = s,
and |ω2 −1| ≤ε0.
Explicitly, the solution reads as
q(t) = s · sin t + . . . ,
ω2 = (1 + δω)2 = 1 + 3

The following proof of Prop. 11.25 is based on a special variant of the Lyapunov–
Schmidt method in bifurcation theory which was invented around 1900 (see Zeidler
(1986), Vol. 1).
Proof. Let ω2 = 1 + ε. Motivated by the resonance case (11.60), we pass to the
equivalent problem
¨q + q + b1(q) sin t = κq3 −εq + s · sin t,
q(0) = q(π) = 0
(11.65)
along with the additional equation
b1(q) = s
which is called the bifurcation equation in mathematics. First regard ε as a free
parameter. To solve (11.65), we will use the iterative method

632
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
¨qn+1 + qn+1 + b1(qn+1) sin t = Fn,
qn+1(0) = qn+1(π) = 0
for n = 0, 1, . . . with
Fn(t) := κqn(t)3 −εqn(t) + s · sin t,
and q0 ≡0. By F0(t) = s · sin t and (11.61),
q1(t) = s · sin t.
Furthermore, since F1(t) = 1

q2(t) = 1

−εs · sin t + s · sin t.
By the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem, the iterative method converges to the function
q = q1 + . . . . Observe the crucial fact that each term of q contains the parameter
s as a factor. Therefore, the bifurcation equation b1(q) = s yields
3
4κs3 −εs + s + . . . = s.
This ﬁxes the parameter ε, namely,
ε = 3
4κs2 + O(s3),
s →0.
Hence q(t) = s · sin t + O(s2), s →0.

11.5.5 The Importance of the Renormalized Green’s Function
Let κ ̸= 0 and s ̸= 0, and suppose that κ and s are suﬃciently small. The solution
q = q(t; κ, s) from Prop. 11.25 satisﬁes the boundary-value problem
¨q + ω(κ, s)2q = κq3,
q(0) = q(π) = 0.
By Prop. 11.21, this is equivalent to the integral equation
q(t; κ, s) =
Z π
0
Gren(t, τ; 1) κ q(τ; κ, s)3dτ
where Gren(t, τ; 1) := G

is called the renormalized Green’s function.

The function ω = ω(κ, s) is an absolutely convergent power series with respect to
the small parameters κ and s. The well-deﬁned renormalized Green’s function Gren

with the singularity at k = 1 because of ω = 1. The passage from G to Gren
corresponds to the passage
12 −k2 ⇒ω(κ, s)2 −k2.
We say that we add counterterms in order to force well-deﬁned expressions.
Roughly speaking, the ill-deﬁned Green’s function G from (11.66) is ob-
tained by linearizing at the wrong angular frequency ω = 1.
Our rigorous approach linearizes at the perturbed angular frequency 1+ δω and we
replace the ill-deﬁned Green’s function G at ω = 1 by the pseudo-Green’s function.
11.5.6 The Renormalization Group
In quantum ﬁeld theory, renormalized quantities depend on the energy E. The
method of the renormalization group studies the dependence of physical quantities
on the positive parameter E (or on other characteristic parameters). Let us explain
the basic idea by considering the following simple model. Consider the boundary-
value problem
d2Q(τ)
dτ 2
+ ω2
T Q(τ) = κT Q(τ)3,
Q(0) = Q(T) = 0.
(11.67)
Using the rescalings τ := πt/T and Q(τ) := q(t), we get
d2q(t)
dt2
+ ω2q(t) = κ q(t)3,
q(0) = q(π) = 0
where
ωT = πω
T ,
κT = π2κ
T 2 .
Introducing w(T ) := ωT
πω =
1
T and k(T) :=
κT
π2κ =

T 2 , we get the renormalization
group equation
w(T1T2) = w(T1)w(T2),
k(T1T2) = k(T1)k(T2)
for all positive numbers T1 and T2. This is a representation of the multiplicative
group R×
+ of positive real numbers. Diﬀerentiation yields the renormalization-group
diﬀerential equation

11.6 The Importance of Algebraic Feynman Integrals
At the beginning of the 19th century, Abel (1802–1829) studied algebraic integrals
of the form
J =
Z
R(z, w(z)) dz
where R is a rational function of the two complex variables z and w, and the
function w = w(z) satisﬁes an algebraic equation
P(z, w(z)) = 0,
z ∈C,
that is, P(z, w) denotes a polynomial with respect to z and w with complex coeﬃ-
cients. If P(w, z) := w2 −(z −e1)(z −e2)(z −e3) with pairwise diﬀerent complex
numbers e1, e2, e3, then J is an elliptic integral. For example,
J =
Z
dz
p
(z −e1)(z −e2)(z −e3)
.
Riemann (1826–1866) showed that algebraic integrals can be understood best by
studying the topology of the corresponding Riemann surface. In the 1940s, Feynman
systematically used higher-dimensional algebraic integrals.
11.6.1 Wick Rotation and Cut-Oﬀ
As a prototype, let us consider the algebraic Feynman integral
J(m) :=
Z ∞
−∞
dE
Z
R3
d3p
(E2 −c2p2 −m2c4)2 .
When computing cross sections for scattering processes of elementary particles via
the Feynman diagram technique, one encounters integrals of such type. These in-
tegrals correspond to the internal lines of the Feynman diagrams. Here, we use the
following notation: E energy, p momentum vector, and m > 0 bare mass of the
elementary particle. Note that the integral J(m) is divergent for the following two
reasons.
• First, the integrand has a singularity if
E2 = c2p2 + m2c4.
This is a hyperboloid in R4 called the mass shell with respect to the mass pa-
rameter m. From the physical point of view, the energy E and momentum vector
p of an elementary particle of rest mass m live on the mass shell, by Einstein’s
energy-momentum relation for a free particle.
• Second, the integrand decreases too slowly as |p| →∞and |E| →∞.
The following deﬁnition is basic. To simplify notation, we replace the SI system by
the energetic system, that is, we set c = 1. For given large cut-oﬀmass Mmax > 0,
we deﬁne the regularized form of the integral J(m) by
regMmaxJ(m) := 2π2i · ln
„Mmax
m
«
.
(11.68)

11.6 The Importance of Algebraic Feynman Integrals
635
In terms of physics, this means that we only consider such physical situations, say,
in a particle accelerator where energy E and momentum vector p satisfy the relation
E2 = p2 + M 2
along with 0 ≤M ≤Mmax. Under this mass restriction, we assign the value (11.68)
to the integral J(m) if Mmax/m ≫1. Let us motivate this deﬁnition.
• Step 1: Wick rotation. To eliminate the indeﬁnite metric of the Minkowski space,
we ﬁrst perform a Wick rotation. This means that we pass over to imaginary
energies by replacing the real axis by the imaginary axis.To this end, we deﬁne
JWick(m) :=
Z i∞
−i∞
dE
Z
R3
d3p
(E2 −p2 −m2)2 .
Use now the substitution
E = iq0,
p := q.
Here, q0 is a real parameter, and we set q2 = q2
0 + q2. We then get
JWick(m) := i
Z ∞
−∞
dq0
Z
R3
d3q
(q2
0 + q2 + m2)2 = i
Z
R4
d4q
(q2 + m2)2 .
This integral is inﬁnite.
• Step 2: Mass cut-oﬀ. Fix Mmax > 0. We deﬁne the cut-oﬀby setting
JWick(m, Mmax) := i
Z
q2≤M2
max
d4q
(q2 + m2)2 .
This is a well-deﬁned classical integral which can be computed easily. In fact,
introducing spherical coordinates,
JWick(m, Mmax) = i
Z Mmax
r=0
Z
S3
r3drdΩ
(r2 + m2)2 .
Using the measure meas(S3) = 2π2 of the 3-dimensional unit sphere S3 and the
rescaling r = mϱ,
JWick(m, Mmax) = 2π2i

Hence

Finally, we obtain the desired expression (11.68) by neglecting the term o(1) if

11.6.2 Dimensional Regularization
For given mass parameters m > 0 and Mmax > 0, we want to show that the
expression (11.68) can also be obtained by a completely diﬀerent approach called
dimensional regularization. Nowadays physicists prefer to use the method of dimen-
sional regularization in renormalization theory, since this method does not destroy
the gauge invariance.35
• Step 1: The classical integral. Let q := (q0, . . . , qD−1). Moreover, introduce the
sum of squares q2 := q2
0 + . . . + q2

where D = 1, 2, . . . and N > D/2. Recall that Euler’s gamma function Γ = Γ(z)
is holomorphic on the complex plane up to ﬁrst-order poles at the singular points
z = 0, −1, −2, . . . At the origin,
Γ(z) = 1
z −C + O(z),
z →0
where C := limn→∞(Pn
k=1

k −ln(n + 1)) = 0.5722 . . . is Euler’s constant.36

(11.70)
Furthermore, Γ(1) = Γ(2) = 1. In general
Γ(n) := (n −1)!,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
In formula (11.69), the pole of the function N →Γ(N −D/2) at the point
N = D/2 indicates that the integral is divergent in this situation. For example,
this is the case if D = 4 and N = 2.
• Step 2: Analytic continuation: Note that
The basic trick of dimensional regularization is to apply analytic continua-
tion to formula (11.69) with respect to the dimension D.
This way, we deﬁne the left-hand integral from (11.69) by the right-hand side of
(11.69) for all complex numbers D with
N −D
2 ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . .
For example, choose D := 4 −δ and N = 2 where 0 < δ < 1. This yields

also Peskin and Schroeder (1995), Kugo (1997), Ryder (1999), and Zinn-Justin
(2004).
36 The experience of physicists shows that this constant is cancelled when comput-
ing quantities that can be observed in physical experiments. A detailed investi-
gation of Euler’s constant can be found in Havil (2003).

by introducing the large ﬁctitious mass Mmax. Generally, the classic Pauli–Villars
method introduces additional physical ﬁelds which contain large ﬁctitious masses.
In contrast to the cut-oﬀmethod, Pauli–Villars regularization does not destroy
the relativistic invariance.38
• Step 4: The limit: Letting δ →+0, we get
lim
δ→+0(Jδ(m) −Jδ(Mmax)) = 2π2i · ln

This coincides with (11.68).
The same method can be applied to broad classes of algebraic Feynman integrals.

11.6.3 Weinberg’s Power-Counting Theorem
An attack is made on the problem of determing the asymptotic behavior
at high energies and momenta of the Green’s function, using new mathe-
matical methods from the theory of real variables. We deﬁne a class An of
functions of n real variables whose asymptotic behavior may be speciﬁed
in a certain manner by means of certain ”asymptotic coeﬃcients“. The
Feynman integrands of perturbation theory (with energies taken imag-
inary) belong to such classes. We then prove that if certain conditions
on the asymptotic coeﬃcients are satisﬁed then an integral over k of the
variables converges, and belongs to the class An−k with new asymptotic
coeﬃcients simply related to the old ones. When applied to perturbation
theory this theorem validates the renormalization procedure of Dyson and
Salam, proving that the renormalized integrals actually do always con-
verge, and provides a simple rule for calculating the asymptotic behavior
of any Green’s function to any order of perturbation theory.
I particularly wish to thank Professor Wightman for his many valuable
suggestions, and for enabling this paper to satisfy Salam’s criterion.

general assumptions, the asymptotics of the integrand implies both the existence
and the asymptotics of the integral for large momenta. The full formulation of this
theorem along with the sophisticated proof can be found in Volume V. The proof
starts with the one-dimensional case by using a compactness argument. One then
proceeds by induction. At this point, we will only consider a special case concerning

For N ≤2, the integral is divergent.
• The situation changes completely if a ≤0. The integral is then divergent for all
exponents N ≥0. In fact, for a = 0, the divergence of the integral is simply a
consequence of
Z ∞
−∞
dy = ∞.
If a < 0, then the denominator has zeros along the hyperbola |a|y2 −x2 = 1
which is responsible for the divergence of the integral.
• The integral
Z
R2
dxdy
(1 + x2)(1 + |y|N)
is convergent for N > 1, and it is divergent for N < 1. This follows from the fact
that the integral
Z ∞
−∞
dy
1 + |y|N
is convergent (resp. divergent) if N > 1 (resp. N < 1).
Observe that in these examples, the danger comes from divergent subintegrals ex-
tended over lower-dimensional domains of integration.

where bij, ci are real numbers for all i, j = 1, . . . , n. In addition, dVH denotes the
volume element of H. Now to the point. The superﬁcial degree of the integral Σ(q)
is deﬁned to be
degsup Σ(q) : = degree of the integrand
plus dimension of the domain of integration.
By deﬁnition, the degree of the integrand is equal to “degree of the numerator
minus degree of the denominator”. For example, the integrand from (11.73) has the
degree 1 −4 = −3. Therefore, the integral Σ(q) from (11.73) has the superﬁcial
degree
degsup = −3 + 1 = −2.
A very useful special case of the Weinberg theorem reads as follows.
Theorem 11.26 The integral (11.74) is absolutely convergent if its superﬁcial de-
gree is negative and the superﬁcial degrees of all of the subintegrals (11.75) are also
negative.
11.6.4 Integration Tricks
We want to summarize prototypes of integration tricks which are frequently used
by physicists in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Cauchy’s residue trick. Consider the rational function
f(x) := a(x)
b(x) ,
x ∈R
where a and b are polynomials of degree α and β, respectively, with complex coeﬃ-
cients. We assume that β −α ≥2, α ≥0, and b(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈R. Let z1, . . . , zK
be precisely the poles of the function f on the upper half-plane. Then

This integral exists in the classical sense.41 In addition, we have
R
R f(x)dx = 0
if the function f has no poles on the upper-half plane. The proof proceeds as in
Problem 12.1 on page 732.
Example. Let m > 0. Consider the integral
J(m) :=
Z
R
dE
m2 −E2 .
This integral does not exist in the classical sense because of the singularity of the
integrand at the points E = ±m. It is our goal to describe two diﬀerent methods
which motivate the deﬁnition
Z

dE
m2 −E2 := iπ

(11.77)
of the regularized value of the divergent integral.
(i) Mass perturbation. We start with the replacement
m ⇒m −µi,
µ > 0
(11.78)
where µ is small. In terms of physics, the choice of the sign of µ is motivated by
the argument (14.14) discussed on page 773 (damped oscillation of a quantum
particle of mass m). By deﬁnition, the regularized integral reads as
J(m −µi) =
Z
R
dE
(m −µi)2 −E2 ,
µ > 0.

(m −µi)2 −E2 =

tells us that the functionE →
1
(m−µi)2−E2 has a pole at the point −m + µi in
the upper half-plane. By (11.76),
J(m −µi) =
iπ
m −µi.
The limit
lim
µ→+0 J(m −µi) = iπ

coincides with (11.77). The same argument shows that the modiﬁed regular-
ization
Jε(m) :=

with J1(m) := iπ/m. For example, J2(m) = iπ/2m3.

11.7 Fundamental Solutions of Diﬀerential Equations
Let N = 1, 2, . . . We want to solve the diﬀerential equation
Lψ = f
on RN
(11.81)
in the sense of distributions. Here, L is a diﬀerential operator with constant complex
coeﬃcients of order m,
L :=
X
|α|≤m
aα∂α
where each aα is a complex number. Naturally enough, we assume that L is not
trivial, that is, there exists at least one nonzero coeﬃcient aα. We are given the
distribution f ∈D′(RN) with compact support. We are looking for a distribution
ψ ∈D′(RN). Motivated by the idea of the Green’s function, we want to reduce the
solution of (11.81) to the equation
LG = δ
on RN.
(11.82)

11.7 Fundamental Solutions of Diﬀerential Equations
645
Each solution G ∈D′(RN) of (11.82) is called a fundamental solution of the diﬀer-
ential operator L. Green’s functions are special fundamental solutions which satisfy
additional side conditions (e.g., initial conditions and boundary conditions).
Theorem 11.27 If G is a fundamental solution of the diﬀerential operator L, then
the convolution G ∗f is a solution of (11.81).
Proof. L(G ∗f) = LG ∗f = δ ∗f = f.
2
For many important diﬀerential equations in mathematical physics, fundamen-
tal solutions are explicitly known. A comprehensive summary can be found in Ort-
ner and Wagner (1997).
(i) For given distribution f ∈D′(R), consider the equation
ψ′ = f
on R.
(11.83)
We are looking for a solution ψ ∈D′(R). The fundamental solutions of (11.83)
have the form
G(t) = θ(t) + const
for all
t ∈R.
This means that G′ = δ. The general solution of (11.83) reads as
ψ = θ ∗f + const.
In particular, if f : R →C is continuous and has compact support, then
ψ(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
θ(t −τ)f(τ)dτ + const =
Z t
−∞
f(τ)dτ + const,
t ∈R.
(ii) Suppose we are given the distribution f as in (i) above. We are looking for a
distribution ψ ∈D′(R) such that
ψ′′ = f
on R.
(11.84)
The fundamental solutions of (11.83) have the form
G(t) = tθ(t) + const · t + const
for all
t ∈R.
This means that G′′ = δ. The general solution of (11.83) reads as
ψ = (gθ) ∗f + const · g + const
where g(t) := t. In particular, if f : R →C is continuous and has compact
support, then
ψ(t) =
Z t
−∞
(t −τ)f(τ)dτ + const · t + const,
t ∈R.
Proof. Ad (i). By (11.42) on page 611, each solution ψ ∈D′(R) of the homogeneous
equation ψ′ = 0 is constant. Thus, two solutions of (11.83) diﬀer by a constant.
Finally, θ′ = δ.
Ad (ii). By the Weyl lemma on page 611, each solution ψ ∈D′(R) of ψ′′ = 0
is a smooth function. Hence ψ(t) = const · t + const. Moreover, we have shown in
(11.41) on page 611 that (gθ)′′ = δ.

11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
11.7.1 The Newtonian Potential
Consider the Poisson equation
ε0∆V = ϱ
on R3.
(11.85)
We are given the distribution ϱ ∈R3 with compact support, and we are looking
for the distribution V ∈D′(R3). In terms of physics, the electric charge density ϱ
generates the electric ﬁeld E = −grad V. The equation
ε0∆G = δ
on R3
(11.86)
corresponds to a charge Q = 1 at the origin.
Proposition 11.28 The general solution of (11.85) is given by
V = G ∗ϱ + W
where W : R3 →C is an arbitrary smooth function with ∆W = 0 on R3, and
G(x) :=
1
4πε0||x||,
x ∈R3 \ {0}
is a fundamental solution satisfying (11.86). If ϱ : R3 →R is a continuous function
with compact support, then
(G ∗ϱ)(x) =
Z
R3
ϱ(y)
4πε0||x −y|| d3y,
x ∈R3.
Proof. By the Weyl lemma on page 611, each distribution V ∈D′(R3) with ∆V = 0
is a smooth function. By Prop. 10.22,
Z
R3 ε0G(x)∆ϕ(x)d3x = ϕ(0)
for all
ϕ ∈D(R3).
This tells us that ε0∆G = δ.

11.7.2 The Existence Theorem
Theorem 11.29 Each nontrivial linear diﬀerential operator with complex constant
coeﬃcients has a tempered distribution as fundamental solution.
In 1958, this crucial theorem was proved by H¨ormander in a sophisticated manner.
An alternative proof was given by Lojasiewicz in 1959. Atiyah showed in 1970 that
this theorem can be proved in an elegant way by using the deep Hironaka theorem.
Let us discuss the main diﬃculty of the proof. By Fourier transform, the original
equation LG = δ passes over to the equation
P ˆG = 1,
ˆG ∈S′(Rn)
(11.87)
where P is a polynomial with respect to the momentum variable p ∈Rn. Naively,
we get
ˆG = 1
P .
However, as a rule, this method does not work, since the zeros of P generate sin-
gularities. This complicates the proof substantially.

11.7.3 The Beauty of Hironaka’s Theorem
In this note I shall show how Hironaka’s theorem42 on the resolution of
singularities leads quickly to a new proof of the H¨ormander–Lojasiewicz
theorem on the division of distributions (generalized functions) and hence
to the existence of tempered fundamental solutions for constant-coeﬃcient
diﬀerential operators. Since most of the diﬃculties in the general theory of
partial diﬀerential operators arise from the singularities of the characteris-
tic variety, it is quite natural to expect Hironaka’s theorem to be relevant.
In fact, this note is primarily intended to draw the attention of analysts
to the power of this theorem.
Michael Atiyah, 197043
In this section, we want to have a look at some deep mathematical theorems which
are related to quantum ﬁeld theory. At the top is the highly sophisticated Hironaka
theorem. It turns out that
An appropriate mathematical tool for quantum ﬁeld theory is the theory of
tempered generalized functions based on the Fourier transform.
In fact, the basic objects of Feynman’s approach to quantum ﬁeld theory, namely,
• the Dirac delta function,
• the Feynman propagators (e.g., the photon propagator and the electron propa-
gator in quantum electrodynamics), and
• the algebraic Feynman integrals (corresponding to internal lines of Feynman
diagrams)
are not classical mathematical functions, but tempered distributions. Let us mention
the following fundamental results:
(i) the 1964 Hironaka theorem on the resolution of singularities in algebraic geom-
etry;
(ii) the 1968 Hironaka–Atiyah–Bernstein–Gelfand (HABG) theorem on meromor-
phic families of tempered distributions;
(iii) propagators of quantum ﬁelds and the 1958 H¨ormander–Lojasiewicz theorem
on the existence of tempered fundamental solutions; this can be based on the
HABG theorem;
(iv) dimensional regularization of Feynman integrals via the HABG theorem;
(v) the zero-mass limit as a tempered generalized function via the HABG theorem;
(vi) the multiplication of generalized functions by using H¨ormander’s wave front
sets, and causal products of propagators (the 1973 Epstein–Glaser approach
to quantum ﬁeld theory via constructing the S-matrix in terms of tempered
generalized functions);
(vii) H¨ormander’s 1971 theory of Fourier integral operators, microlocal analysis,
and Radzikowski’s 1996 theory for Hadamard states in quantum gravitation;
(viii) Analytic continuation of functions of many complex variables; analyticity
properties of the Fourier transform or Laplace transform of tempered gener-
alized functions (the Paley–Wiener theorem and Bogoliubov’s “edge-of-the-
wedge” theorem); proof of the fundamental CPT theorem in the setting of
axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory by Res Jost in 1957.

Mathematically, important contributions came from Laurent Schwartz (theory of

(general theory of linear partial diﬀerential operators). See H¨ormander (1983), Vols.
1–4.44
In terms of quantum ﬁeld theory, during the 1950s important impacts came
from Arthur Wightman in Princeton and Nikolai Bogoliubov in Moscow and from
their numerous collaborators. In what follows, let us sketch some of the main ideas.
The Hironaka theorem on the resolution of singularities. We want to
study the behavior of the equation
F(x) = 0,
x ∈Rn
(11.88)
near the origin, x = 0. The simplest case is the equation
y = 0,
(x, y) ∈R2
where the solutions are the points of the x-axis. However, we also allow singularities.
As a prototype, consider the equation
xy = 0,
(x, y) ∈R2.
Here, the solutions consist of the points of both the x-axis, y = 0, and the y-axis,
x = 0. We want to generalize this. To this end, we assume that the nonzero function
F : U(0) →R
is real analytic in a neighborhood U(0) of the origin.45 It is our goal to transform
the function F into the local normal form
F(ϕ(z)) = f(z)zα1
1 zα2

· · · zαn
n ,
z ∈V (0)
(11.89)
on a neighborhood V (0) of the origin in Rn (Fig. 11.4). For the real exponents,
α1 ≥0, . . . , αn ≥0. Furthermore,
f(z) ̸= 0
on
V (0),
44 Laurent Schwartz, Lars H¨ormander, Michael Atiyah, and Heisuke Hironaka were
awarded the Fields medal in 1950, 1962, 1966, and 1970, respectively.
45 This means that the function F can be represented as an absolutely convergent
power series expansion on U(0),
F(x) = a0 + a1x1 + . . . + anxn + a12x1x2 + . . .
with real coeﬃcients a0, a1, . . .

and the function f : V (0) →R is real analytic. The original equation (11.88) then
passes over to the equivalent equation
zα1
1 zα2
2
· · · zαn
n
= 0,
z ∈V (0)
which can be solved easily. Hironaka’s theorem (1964) tells us that
The local normal form (11.89) can be obtained by a regular local coordinate
transformation, x = ϕ(z).
More precisely, there exists a surjective, real analytic map
ϕ : V (0) →U(0)
on a neighborhood V (0) of the origin such that the following hold true:
• The map ϕ is proper, that is, the preimages of compact sets are again compact.
• Let Z denote the set of zeros of the original equation (11.88), that is,
Z := {x ∈U(0) :
F(x) = 0}.
Let Z be the preimage of the zero set Z under the coordinate transformation
x = ϕ(z), i.e.,
Z := {z ∈V (0) :
F(ϕ(z)) = 0}.
• The complementary map ϕ : V (0) \ Z →U(0) \ Z is a real analytic diﬀeomor-
phism.46
This is a special case of general results due to Hironaka (1964), pp. 109–326; the
local normal form quoted above is a consequence of the theorem on page 170 of
Hironaka’s paper applied to analytic local rings.
Note that Hironaka’s theorem represents a far-reaching generalization of the
implicit function theorem. This theorem corresponds to the special case where
F ′(0) ̸= 0. Then, the normal form looks like
F(ϕ(z)) = f(z)z1,
z ∈V (0)
with f(z) ̸= 0 on the neighborhood V (0). This means that the solutions of the
equation F(x) = 0 are given by the smooth hypersurface x = ϕ(z) near the origin.
The genesis of the implicit function theorem and the Hironaka theorem goes
back to Newton (1643-1727) who developed the method of Newton polygons in
order to study the zeros of polynomial equations in two variables. For example, the
two local solution branches of the equation
2x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y3 + y4 = 0
near the origin, x = 0, y = 0, read as
y = (−1 ± i)x + o(x)
and
y = ±ix1/2 + o(x1/2),
x →0.
The appearance of fractional powers is typical for “this type of problem”. This
means that besides power series expansions we also encounter Puiseux expansions as
solutions. See Zeidler (1986), Vol. 1, p. 431. In quantum ﬁeld theory, such expansions
are called singular Landau expansions.
46 Explicitly, the map ϕ : V (0) \ Z →U(0) \ Z is bijective and real analytic, and
the inverse map is also real analytic.

650
11. Distributions and Green’s Functions
Further important contributions to the implicit function theorem were made
by Lagrange (1736–1813), Cauchy (1789–1857), and Weierstrass (1815–1897) (the
Weierstrass preparation theorem is a forerunner of Hironaka’s theorem). A fairly
elementary discussion of the Hironaka approach to the blowing-up of singularities
in algebraic geometry can be found in the survey article by Hauser (2003).
Besides the Hironaka theorem, there exists another deep generalization of the
regular implicit function theorem called the hard implicit function theorem (or
the Nash–Moser theorem). This theorem allows applications to chaotic motions in
celestial mechanics (KAM theory) and to embedding theorems in the theory of
manifolds.47
The Hironaka–Atiyah–Bernstein–Gelfand theorem on meromorphic
families of generalized functions. Let us study the integral
Fs(ϕ) :=
Z
H≥
f(x)sϕ(x)dnx
(11.90)
for all test functions ϕ ∈D(Rn) and ﬁxed complex exponent s with ℜ(s) > 0. Our
goal is to extend the function s →Fs(ϕ) analytically to the complex plane. We
cannot expect that this extended function is holomorphic on the complex plane.
For physics, however, it is suﬃcient, that the extended function is meromorphic on
the complex plane. In fact, the theorem below tells us that this property is met. To
be precise, we assume that the nonzero function
f : Rn →R
is real analytic and nonnegative. We set x = (t, x1, . . . , xn−1), and deﬁne the closed
half-space
H≥:= {x ∈Rn :
t ≥0}.
In applications to physics, t plays the role of time. Then, for each complex number s
with ℜ(s) > 0, Fs is a generalized function which lies in the Schwartz space D′(Rn).
Theorem 11.30 For each test function ϕ ∈D(Rn), the function
s →Fs(ϕ)
can be extended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane.
This theorem can be generalized in the following way.
• We replace Rn by an n-dimensional, real analytic, paracompact, and connected
manifold X.
• We replace the closed half-space H≥by the set
H≥:= {x ∈X :
g1(x) ≥0, . . . , gp(x) ≥0}
where g1, . . . , gp : X →R are real analytic functions.
• The nonzero real analytic function f : X →R is nonnegative.
For further material, we refer to the lectures by Etinghoﬀ(1999).

including detailed historical comments, we recommend the monograph by Krantz
and Parks (2002). We also recommend Nirenberg (2001), Scheck (2000), Vol. 1

11.8 Functional Integrals
Feynman’s path integrals are both inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals
and continuous partition functions.
Folklore
By Theorem 11.8 on page 587, the initial-value problem for the heat equation is
completely determined by the knowledge of the heat kernel.
In terms of the heat equation, the Feynman functional integral approach
represents the heat kernel as an inﬁnite-dimensional integral.
This fundamental idea can be generalized to the time-evolution of general physical
systems. The Feynman approach can be viewed as a generalization of the classical
Fourier method via Fourier series or Fourier integral. Physicists like functional
integrals very much, since they allow elegant explicit computations based on the
following crucial methods:
• approximation by ﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals,
• the method of stationary phase,
• inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals and the method of zeta function regular-
ization, and
• (formal) analytic continuation.
From the mathematical point of view, functional integrals represent an extraordi-
narily useful mnemonic tool for conjecturing rigorous results. Unfortunately, the
rigorous proofs are frequently missing or they have to be based on sophisticated
methods. Let us sketch the main ideas for the heat kernel. We will restrict our-
selves to the elegant formal language used by physicists which can be immediately
translated
• to the Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics by replacing real time by
imaginary time, t ⇒it/ℏ,
• and to quantum ﬁeld theory.
11.8.1 The Feynman Path Integral for the Heat Equation
The heat kernel. Let κ > 0. For a given initial time s, consider the initial-value
problem
∂T
∂t (x, t) = −κ∆T (x, t) −U(x)T(x, t),
x ∈R3, t ≥s,
T (x, s) = T0(x),
x ∈R3.
(11.91)
The solution formula reads as
T(x, t) =
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, s) T0(y) d3y
for all x ∈R3 and t ≥s. For the heat kernel K, we get Feynman’s key formula
K(x, t; y, s) = lim

(11.93)
Here, we use the equidistant decomposition
t0 = s < t1 < t2 < . . . < tn+1 = t
of the time interval [s, t] where tj := s + j∆t. Equivalently, the key formula (11.92)
can be written as

Observe that the inﬁnitesimal heat kernel coincides with the free heat kernel if the
potential vanishes, U ≡0. Summarizing,
Feynman’s key formula (11.92) reduces the full heat kernel under the inﬂu-
ence of the potential U to an inﬁnite-dimensional integral which depends
on the simpler, explicitly known inﬁnitesimal heat kernel.
Let us give a formal proof via the elegant Dirac calculus.
Step 1: The heat kernel. Introduce the Hamiltonian
H := H0 + U
with the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 := κP2 = κ∆, and P := −i∂. The heat
equation (11.91) reads then as
˙T(t) = −HT(t),
t ≥0,
T (s) = T0.
This equation has the solution
T(t) = e−H(t−s)T0,
t ≥s.
Using Dirac’s completeness relation
R
R3 d3y |y⟩⟨y| = I,
⟨x|T (t)⟩=
Z
R3 d3y ⟨x|e−H(t−s)|y⟩⟨y|T0⟩.
This implies
T(x, t) =
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, s) T0(y) d3y
for all x ∈R3 and all t ≥s with the heat kernel
K(x, t; y, s) := ⟨x|e−H(t−s)|y⟩.
Step 2: Causality. The heat kernel satisﬁes the product formula
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
R3 d3z K(x, t; z, τ) K(z, τ; y, s)

11.8 Functional Integrals
653
if t > τ > s. This follows from the causality relation
e−H(t−s) = e−H(t−τ) e−H(τ−s)
along with the completeness relation
R
d3z |z⟩⟨z| = I. Hence
⟨x|e−H(t−s)|y⟩=
Z
R3 d3z ⟨x|e−H(t−τ)|z⟩⟨z|e−H(τ−s)|y⟩.
Analogously, K(x, t; y, s) is equal to the following multiple integral
Z
R3n d3xn d3xn−1 · · · d3x1×
×K(x, t; xn, tn) K(xn, tn; xn−1, tn−1) · · · K(x1, t1; y, s).
For small time intervals ∆t, the basic idea is now to replace the heat kernel
K(xj+1, tj+1 ; xj, tj) = ⟨xj+1|e−(H0+U)∆t|xj⟩
by the inﬁnitesimal heat kernel
K∆t(xj+1, tj+1 ; xj, tj) := ⟨xj+1|e−H0∆t e−U∆t|xj⟩
and to perform the limit n →∞, i.e., ∆t →+0. This will produce the claim (11.92).
Let us motivate this.
Step 3: The Trotter product formula. By the addition theorem for the exponen-
tial function,
e−H(t−s) = e−H(t−tn) e−H(tn−tn−1) · · · e−H(t1−s).
Noting that H = H0 + U, the Trotter product formula tells us that
e−H(t−s) = lim
n→∞e−H0(t−tn) e−U(t−tn) · · · e−H0(t1−s) e−U(t1−s).
(11.94)
This means that, for small time intervals ∆t, we can replace approximately
e−(H0+U)∆t by the product e−H0∆te−U∆t. This is motivated by
eA∆t = I + A∆t + o(∆t),
∆t →+0,
and hence
e(A+B)∆t = eA∆teB∆t + o(∆t),
∆t →+0.
By the completeness relation
R
d3x |x⟩⟨x| = I, it follows from (11.94) that the
transition amplitude ⟨x|e−H(t−s)|y⟩is equal to
lim
n→∞
Z
R3n d3xn · · · d3x1 K∆t(x, t; xn, tn) · · · K∆t(x1, t1; y, s).

show that

The integral

can be viewed approximately as a summation over all possible piecewise linear paths
q = q(t) from the point y at time s to the point x at time t along with the node
points
q(tj) = xj,
j = 0, . . . , n + 1.
Here, x0 := y and xn+1 := x. Then
S(q) =
Z t

Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to write the key formula (11.92) as
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z q(t)=x
q(s)=y
e−S(q) Dq.
(11.97)
Here, we sum over all paths q = q(t) connecting the starting point y with the point
ﬁnal x.
The point is that the famous Feynman–Kac formula (11.97) can be given a
rigorous meaning, in the sense of a classical measure integral with respect to the
Wiener measure on the space of continuous curves q : [s, t] →R3. This can be found
in Reed and Simon (1972), Vol. II, Sect. X.11. In terms of physics, we regard the

11.8 Functional Integrals
655
diﬀerential equation (11.91) as diﬀusion equation for the mass density function T.
Microscopically, diﬀusion corresponds to the stochastic motion of molecules (Brow-
nian motion). This stochastic process can be described by some probability measure
on the space of continuous paths. This measure was introduced by Norbert Wiener
in 1923. The path integral (11.97) represents the corresponding Wiener integral.48
11.8.3 The Method of Quantum Fluctuations
We want to discuss a formal method which is frequently used by physicists in order
to compute Feynman functional integrals in an elegant way. It is our goal
• to separate quantum ﬂuctuations from the classical motion, and
• to compute the Feynman functional integral corresponding to quantum ﬂuctua-
tions by the method of zeta function regularization.
We will apply this method to the heat kernel. However, the same method also
applies to the Feynman propagator kernel for the Schr¨odinger equation. Let us
consider the heat equation (11.91) with vanishing potential, U ≡0. Below we want
to show the following.
(i) Choose the action
S(q) :=

Then

(11.98)
Here, qclass is the solution to the action principle
S(q) = stationary ! ,
q(s) = y, q(t) = x.

The crucial point is the veriﬁcation of (11.101) below.
Step 1: Computation of qclass. The Euler–Lagrange equation to (11.99) reads
as

q(s) = y, q(t) = x

Step 2: Decomposition. For an arbitrary motion, we set
q(τ) := qclass(τ) + r(τ)
along with the boundary condition r(s) = r(t) = 0 for the remainder r. Hence
S(q) = S(qclass) + S(r) + R

This implies (11.98).
Step 3: Proof of (11.101). Let us ﬁrst consider the special case of the motion
q = q(τ) on the real line, that is, we want to show that
Z q(t)=0

49 Note the following nice fact. In applications of path integrals to quantum ﬁeld
theory, one wants to compute correlation functions. In this case, the explicit
knowledge of the normalization factor is not necessary, since the correlation
functions are given by quotients of functional integrals where the normalization
factors are cancelled.

11.8.5 The Euclidean Trick and the Feynman Path Integral for
the Schr¨odinger Equation
One of the main tricks used in physics is to reduce the Schr¨odinger equation to the
Fourier heat equation by passing to imaginary time. This is called the Euclidean
trick. Explicitly, replacing the time t by it/ℏand choosing the coupling constant
κ := ℏ2/2m, the initial problem (11.91) for the heat equation passes over to the
initial-value problem for the Schr¨odinger equation

and the equidistant decomposition t0 = s < t1 < t2 < . . . < tn+1 = t of the time
interval [s, t] where tj := s + j∆t. Explicitly, we start with the discrete action S for
the heat equation introduced in (11.93). We obtain the action S for the Schr¨odinger
equation by using the following replacements:
• ∆t ⇒i∆t/ℏ,
• −S ⇒iS/ℏ, and

Furthermore, after carrying out the formal limit ∆t →0, we get

ommend Zeidler (1995), Vol. 1, Chap. 5. Much material on path integrals can be
found in the following monographs: Schulmann (1981), Chaichian and Demichev
(2001), Vols. 1, 2, Kleinert (1990), and Roepstorﬀ(1996). In the handbook on path
integrals by Grosche and Steiner (1998), one ﬁnds an extensive list of about 200
pages which summarizes all of the explicitly known path integrals in quantum me-
chanics. This handbook also contains quite interesting comments on the history of

Glimm and Jaﬀe (1981), Klauder and Daubchies (1982), Klauder (1989), (2000).
We also refer to Freidlin (1985) and Johnson, Lapidus (2000).
For Brownian motion, stochastic processes and the Wiener integral, we refer to
Hida (1970), Yeh (1973), and Chung, Zha (1995) (from Brownian motion to the
Schr¨odinger equation).
The main trouble with Feynman integrals in quantum physics. The
typical mathematical diﬃculty is based on the fact that, in contrast to the Wiener
integral for the heat equation, the formal Feynman measures Dq and Dψ for the
Schr¨odinger equation and the equations of quantum ﬁeld theory, respectively, do
not exist as classical measures. Therefore, the Feynman path integral and its gen-
eralizations to quantum ﬁeld theory do not exist as standard measure integrals. We
refer to Cameron (1960) and Johnson, Lapidus (2000), Sect. 4.6.

If the frequency ω is real, then the integral does not exist. To overcome this diﬃculty,
the idea is to pass to complex frequencies ω living in the open lower half-plane

The function a = a(ω) is called the Fourier–Laplace transform of the Heaviside

The Paley–Wiener–Schwartz theorem. This famous theorem of analysis
shows that distributions with compact support and entire analytic functions with
appropriate growth conditions are indeed the same via Fourier–Laplace transform.
In what follows, let n = 1, 2, . . . , and R > 0. To ﬁx the terminology, recall that the
symbol D(Rn) denotes the set of all smooth functions f : Rn →C with compact
support. The symbol Bn
R is used for the closed ball {x ∈Rn : ||x|| ≤R}. Finally,
for each p ∈Cn, we set
ep(x) := e−i⟨x|p⟩,
x ∈Rn
where we use the convention ⟨x|p⟩:= Pn
j=1 xjpj.
(i) The Paley–Wiener theorem for smooth functions with compact support: For each
function f ∈D(Rn) with support in the ball Bn
R, the Fourier–Laplace transform
a(p) :=
1
(2π)n/2
Z
Rn f(x)ep(x)dnx,
p ∈Cn
is holomorphic on the complex momentum space Cn, and it satisﬁes the fol-
lowing decay condition at inﬁnity:
|a(p)| ≤const(N) · eR|ℑ(p)|
(1 + ||p||)N
(11.108)
for all p ∈Cn and all exponents N = 1, 2, . . . The crucial point is that the
converse is also true. Explicitly, if the function a : Cn →C is holomorphic and
satisﬁes the decay condition (11.108), then it is the Fourier–Laplace transform
of a function f ∈D(Rn) with support in the ball Bn
R.
(ii) The Schwartz theorem for distributions with compact support: For each distri-
bution F ∈D′(Rn) with support in the ball Bn
R, the Fourier–Laplace transform
a(p) := F(ep),
p ∈Cn
is holomorphic on the complex momentum space Cn, and it satisﬁes the fol-
lowing polynomial growth condition:
|a(p)| ≤const · (1 + ||p||)N eR|ℑ(p)|
(11.109)
for all p ∈Cn and some ﬁxed natural number N.51 The converse is also true.
Explicitly, if the function a : Cn →C is holomorphic and satisﬁes the growth
condition (11.109), then it is the Fourier–Laplace transform of a distribution
F ∈D′(Rn) with support in the ball Bn
R.
(iii) Polynomials: Suppose that the support of the distribution F ∈D′(Rn) consists
precisely of the origin. Then, there exists a natural number N such that
F =
X
|α|≤N
aα∂αδ,
51 Naturally enough, the restriction of a(p) to real momenta p coincides with the
usual Fourier transform for tempered distributions.

where aα denotes a complex number. This tells us that F is a ﬁnite sum of
partial derivatives of Dirac’s delta distribution. The Fourier–Laplace transform
reads then as
a(p) =

|α|≤N

(2π)n/2 · i|α|aαpα,
p ∈Cn.
Conversely, each polynomial a = a(p) on the complex momentum space Cn is
the Fourier–Laplace transform of a distribution which has precisely the origin
as support. This shows that the Dirac delta distribution and its partial deriva-
tives are quite natural objects, from the point of view of the Fourier–Laplace
transform. For example, the distribution
F = aδ + bδ′ + cδ′′
on the real line R with complex numbers a, b, c has the Fourier–Laplace trans-
form

The proofs of statements (i)-(iii) above can be found in H¨ormander (1983), Vol. 1,
Sect. 7.3. As we will show in Volume II, statement (iii) plays a crucial role in the
Epstein–Glaser approach to the renormalization of quantum ﬁeld theories.
11.9.2 The Riemann–Hilbert Problem
Let us decompose the complex plane C into the real line, the open upper half-plane
C> := {z ∈C : ℑ(z) > 0},
and the open lower half-plane C< := {z ∈C : ℑ(z) < 0}. We also set z = x+yi, that
is, x and y are the real and imaginary part of the complex number z, respectively.52
The prototype of the Riemann–Hilbert problem reads as follows. We are given the
function f ∈D(R). We are looking for a complex-valued function F which has the
following properties:
(i) F is holomorphic on both the open half-planes C> and C<.
(ii) For each point x on the real line, we have the following jump condition
lim
y→+0 F(x + yi) −lim
y→−0 F(x + yi) = f(x)
for the boundary values of F on the real line.53
Theorem 11.31 The Riemann–Hilbert problem has the solution
F = i
2 · H(f).
52 The closed upper half-plane is deﬁned by C≥:= {z ∈C : ℑ(z) ≥0}.
53 We tacitly assume that the limits exist.

11.9 A Glance at Harmonic Analysis

Explicitly, H(f) is given as follows. Fix the function f ∈D(R). For arbitrary
complex number z, deﬁne
H(f)(z) := 1
π · PV
Z
R
f(ξ)dξ
z −ξ .
If z lies on the real line (resp. not on the real line), then the integral is to be
understood in the sense of Cauchy’s principal value (resp. in the classical sense).
Theorem 11.31 follows now from the following two statements.
(P1) The function H(f) is holomorphic on C> and C<.
(P2) For all points on the real line, x ∈R, we have the Sokhotski formula
lim
y→±0 H(f)(x + iy) = H(f)(x) ∓if(x).
(11.110)
Proof. Ad (P1). This is a standard result for holomorphic functions. It follows from
the Weierstrass theorem on sequences of holomorphic functions which converge on
a compact set. See Remmert (1991), p. 249.
Ad (P2). This follows from Theorem 11.16 on page 619.

11.9.3 The Hilbert Transform
Let us restrict the operator H to the real line. That is, we consider the function
z →H(f)(z) on the real line. We then get the operator
H : D(R) →L2(R).
It turns out that this operator can be uniquely extended to a linear continuous
operator
H : L2(R) →L2(R)
which is called the Hilbert transform. This operator has the following crucial prop-
erty concerning the boundary values of holomorphic functions.
Theorem 11.32 Let F : C> →C be a holomorphic function on the open upper
half-plane such that we have the following growth restriction
sup
y>0
Z ∞
−∞
|F(x + yi)|2dx < ∞.
Then the limit u(x) + iv(x) := limy→+0 F(x + yi) exists for almost all x ∈R.
Moreover, the real part u and the imaginary part v of the boundary values of the
function F on the real line lie in the Hilbert space L2(R), and they are related to
each other by the Hilbert transform. Explicitly,
v = Hu
and
u = −Hv.
The proof can be found in Titchmarsh (1967). For the Hilbert transform in distri-
bution theory, we refer to Pandey (1996).
Example. The assumptions of Theorem 11.32 are satisﬁed if
F(z) :=
a
(z −b)n ,
z ∈C \ {b}
where a and b are complex numbers with ℑ(b) < 0, and n = 1, 2, . . .

11.9.4 Symmetry and Special Functions
The experience of mathematicians and physicists shows that
Behind special functions, there lurk symmetry groups.
Roughly speaking, all of the important special functions that appear in mathemati-
cal physics are governed by symmetries. For example, we have shown in Sect. 7.20.3
on page 409 that the addition theorem for the exponential function
ei(θ+ϕ) = eiθeiϕ
for all
θ, ϕ ∈R
(11.111)
is closely related to the group of rotations in the plane. By the Euler formula
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ
for all
θ ∈R,
we get the addition theorem
sin(θ + ϕ) = sin θ cos ϕ + sin ϕ cos θ
for all
θ, ϕ ∈R
for the sine function. Symmetry groups will be carefully studied in the later volumes.
At this point, let us only sketch the relation between the exponential function ez
(resp. the function zα) and the corresponding Haar measures. The existence of an
invariant measure for Lie groups was proven by Haar (1885–1933) in the year of his
death. This result had far-reaching consequences for harmonic analysis.
(i) The additive group R of real numbers: This group is isomorphic to the group
of translations on the real line. It follows from the addition theorem for the
exponential function ei(p+r)x = eipxeirx that for each ﬁxed x ∈R, the map
p →eixp
(11.112)
is a group morphism from the additive group R onto the multiplicative group
U(1). Superposition of these exponential functions,
f(x) =
Z
R
a(p)eipxdµ(p),
x ∈R,
generates the Fourier transform with the Haar measure
Z b
a
dµ(p) =
Z b
a
dp = b −a,
a, b ∈R.
This measure has the characteristic property that it is invariant under the
group action a →a + c, b →b + c for each ﬁxed c ∈R. Note that the Haar
measure of the additive group R coincides with the classical Lebesgue measure
on the real line.
(ii) The additive group Z of integers: The map (11.112) is a group morphism from
the additive group Z into the multiplicative group U(1). The superposition
f(x) =
Z
R
a(p)e2πipxdµ(p) =
∞
X
n=−∞
a(n)e2πinx
generates the discrete Fourier transform. Here, in contrast to (i), the Haar
measure µ of the group Z corresponds to a mass distribution on the real line
which assigns the unit mass to each point of Z.

(iii) The multiplicative group R×
+ of positive real numbers: Let p, r, x > 0. It follows
from the product rule (pr)x = pxrx that, for each ﬁxed x ∈R×
+, the map
p →px
is a group morphism from the multiplicative group R×
+ into itself. The Haar
measure µ of the group R×
+ is given by
Z b
a
dµ(p) =

d ln p = ln b

b > a > 0.
This measure has the characteristic property that it is invariant under the

f(x) =
Z ∞
0
a(p)pxd ln p =
Z ∞

a(p)px−1dp,
x > 0
generates the Mellin transform (6.18) on page 290.
The Laplace transform is obtained from (i) and (ii) by restricting the measure µ to
the interval [0, ∞[ and the set {0, 1, 2, . . .}, respectively.
This summary shows that the simplest groups R, Z and R×
+ already provide
us with a rich harmonic analysis. Observe that the group Z ⊗Z yields the large
class of double-periodic (i.e., elliptic) functions. Much material on the relations
between symmetry groups and special functions can be found in the four-volume
treatise by Vilenkin and Klimyk (1991). We also refer to Zagier (1995) (modular
functions), Ford (1972) (automorphic functions), Knapp (1986) and Gelfand (1989)
(non-compact groups).

1 −. . . −x2

is called the solid forward light cone (Fig. 11.5).

the solid forward light cone C+. Then there exists always a holomorphic function
T : Rn+1 −iC+ →C such that

11.10 The Trouble with the Euclidean Trick
The passage t →−it from real time t in quantum physics to imaginary time −it is
called the Euclidean trick. For example, this transformation sends the Schr¨odinger
equation to the diﬀusion equation (see (11.13) on page 588). The experience of
physicists shows that this trick is quite useful. From the mathematical point of
view, note that
The Euclidean trick has to be handled very carefully.
Let us discuss two typical diﬃculties.
(i) Oscillating kernels. If we apply the Euclidean trick to the free quantum particle,
then the heat kernel and the Feynman propagator kernel behave quite diﬀer-
ently. Typically, this diﬀerence can be reduced to the fact that the Gaussian
integral
Z ∞
−∞
e−x2
2 −iaxdx =
√

is convergent, whereas the oscillating Fourier integral
Z ∞
−∞
eixdx =
Z ∞
−∞
(cos x + i sin x)dx
is divergent. The heat kernel is of the ﬁrst type, whereas the Feynman propaga-
tor kernel corresponds to an oscillating integral. In the history of mathematics
and physics, the following two oscillating integrals
Z ∞

eix2 dx = (1 + i)
r

and
Z ∞

played an important role in geometric optics and the theory of the Fourier
integral, respectively. These two integrals are called the Fresnel integral and
the sDirichlet integral, respectively.54 The existence of these two integrals is
closely related to the method of stationary phase (see Sect. 12.5.3 on page 714)
which plays a crucial role for Feynman path integrals.

∂2ψ
∂x2 −1
c2
∂2ψ
∂t2 = 0
(11.113)
and changing the notation, y := ct, we get the Laplace equation
∂2ψ
∂x2 + ∂2ψ
∂y2 = 0.
(11.114)
Note that both equations describe completely diﬀerent physical processes,
namely,
• the wave propagation of a mass density ψ on the real line, and
• the stationary temperature distribution ψ on the Euclidean plane R2.
Whereas the wave equation (11.113) allows the propagation of discontinuities,
the solutions of the stationary heat equation (Laplace equation) (11.114) are
always smooth. More precisely, the following hold true.
• The function
ψ(x, t) := θ(x −ct)
is a solution of the wave equation (11.113) on R2 in the sense of distributions,
by the argument given on page 613. This solution describes the propagation
of a singularity located at the point x = ct at time t (see Fig. 11.3 on page
613).
• If the temperature function ψ : R2 →R is absolutely integrable over every
disk and satisﬁes the stationary heat equation (11.114) on R2 in the sense
of distributions, then ψ is smooth on R2. More generally, the Weyl lemma
on page 611 tells us that each distribution ψ ∈D′(R2) with ∆ψ = 0 is a
smooth function on R2.
Example (ii) above tells us that
The Euclidean trick can never be used for describing shock waves.
This fact limits the use of the Euclidean trick in quantum ﬁeld theory. In terms of
mathematics, it is not possible to reduce the theory of hyperbolic partial diﬀeren-
tial equations to the much simpler theory of elliptic partial diﬀerential equations.
Observe that quantum ﬁelds possess the typical character of hyperbolic partial
diﬀerential equations.
A far-reaching mathematical analysis of propagating singularities can be based
on the modern notion of the wave front set of a distribution (see Sect. 12.5.2 on
page 706). In this setting, the wave front set of the solution of a homogeneous
elliptic partial diﬀerential equation (e.g., the stationary heat equation) is empty,
whereas the solutions of hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations (e.g., the wave
equation) possess nontrivial wave front sets which are related to the intuitive notion
of propagating discontinuities.

12.1 The Discrete Dirac Calculus
For understanding the Dirac calculus used by physicists, it is useful to start with
a discrete variant of this calculus. This also helps to avoid divergent expressions,
say, in quantum electrodynamics. In this chapter, we will use the international SI
system of units.
12.1.1 Lattices
The basic idea is to use a truncated lattice in momentum space. To discuss this,
let
x = x1i + x2j + x3k
be the position vector with respect to a right-handed (x1, x2, x3)-Cartesian coordi-
nate system. Here, i, j, k is a right-handed orthonormal system of vectors. Consider
the cube
C(L) :=
˘
(x1, x2, x3) ∈R3 :
−L
2 ≤x1, x2, x3 ≤L
2
¯
of side length L > 0. It is our goal to put the given physical ﬁeld in the cube
C(L) and to assume that the ﬁeld has the period L with respect to the Cartesian
coordinates x1, x2, x3. The cube C(L) has the volume V = L3 which is called the
normalization volume in physics. Furthermore, let G be a lattice in momentum
space. Explicitly, let G be the set of all momentum vectors
p := 2πℏ
L
· m
(12.1)
with the lattice vectors m = m1i + m2j + m3k where m1, m2, m3 are integers.
The following terminology is chosen in such a way that it ﬁts well the Dirac
calculus to be introduced below.
Orthogonality relation. For each momentum vector p ∈G, the function
f(x) := eipx/ℏ
has the period L with respect to the Cartesian coordinates x1, x2, x3. Introducing

in Volume II on quantum electrodynamics that the ﬁnal cross sections computed
via Feynman diagrams do not depend on the choice of the normalization volume V
and the normalization time T.
In this context, let us mention that we will show on page 730 that the square
of the Dirac delta distribution does not exist as a reasonable mathematical object.
Therefore, we will use the strategy of discrete approximations in this treatise.

obtain the following relations.

Rigorous formulas. The formal relations (i)-(iv) above correspond to rigorous
formulas if we introduce the following notation:
• ⟨x|f⟩:= f(x) and ⟨f|x⟩= ⟨x|f⟩†,
• ⟨p|f⟩:= ap and ⟨f|p⟩= ⟨p|f⟩†,
• ⟨x|p⟩:= eixp/ℏ/(2πℏ)3/2 and ⟨p|x⟩= ⟨x|p⟩†,
• ⟨y|x⟩:= δC(L)(y −x),
• ⟨q|p⟩:= δG(N)(q −p).
Furthermore, the fact that ⟨y|x⟩∈R implies the symmetry property
⟨y|x⟩= ⟨y|x⟩† = ⟨x|y⟩.
Similarly, ⟨q|p⟩= ⟨q|p⟩† = ⟨p|q⟩.
12.1.4 The Formal Continuum Limit
Mnemonically, Dirac’s delta function is the formal lattice limit of the dis-
crete Dirac delta function.
Folklore
Later on we will carry out the following two limits.
(H) High-energy limit: N →+∞.
(L) Low-energy limit: L →+∞.
In terms of the momentum vector p, observe that the limits (H) and (L) correspond
to |p| →∞and ∆pj →0, respectively.
Our notation has to be chosen in such a way that these two limits lead to
the classical formulas for the Fourier integral.

In fact, from (12.3) and (12.4) we get the Fourier transform

Applying the limits N →+∞and L →+∞to (12.5) and (12.6), physicists write
formally

R3 ei(y−x)p/ℏd3p
(12.14)
and
f(y) =

(12.15)
Formula (12.7) in momentum space passes over to
δ(q −p) =

Z
R3 ei(p−q)x/ℏd3x.
Finally, from (12.8) we get
g(q) =
Z
R3 δ(q −p) g(p)d3p.
This coincides with (12.14) and (12.15), respectively, by using the substitution
x ⇒−x.
In a straightforward manner, the discrete Dirac calculus can be generalized to
the continuous case by carrying out the limits N →∞and L →+∞in a formal
way. In particular, discrete delta functions in position and momentum space pass
over to Dirac’s delta function. Formally,
δC(L)(x) →δ(x),
δG(N)(p) →δ(p).
The discrete completeness relations pass over to the following formal continuous
completeness relations:

R
R3 |x⟩⟨x| d3x = I,
(C2)
R
R3 |p⟩⟨p| d3p = I.
From these completeness relations, we formally obtain the following relations.

R3⟨x|p⟩⟨p|f⟩d3p.
(ii) Inverse Fourier transform: ⟨p|f⟩=
R
R3⟨p|x⟩⟨x|f⟩d3x.
(iii) Dirac’s delta function in position space:
⟨y|x⟩=

and ⟨y|f⟩=

⟨q|p⟩=

This corresponds to the classical formulas for the Fourier transform if we introduce
the following notation:
• ⟨x|f⟩:= f(x) and ⟨f|x⟩= ⟨x|f⟩†,
• ⟨p|f⟩:= ap and ⟨f|p⟩= ⟨p|f⟩†,
• ⟨x|p⟩:= eixp/ℏ/(2πℏ)3/2 and ⟨p|x⟩= ⟨x|p⟩†,
• ⟨y|x⟩:= δ(y −x),
• ⟨q|p⟩:= δ(q −p).
Moreover, ⟨y|x⟩= ⟨y|x⟩† = ⟨x|y⟩and ⟨q|p⟩= ⟨q|p⟩† = ⟨p|q⟩.
12.2 Rigorous General Dirac Calculus
We now want to show how the formal Dirac calculus introduced in Sect. 11.2 on
page 589 can be given a rigorous meaning by using the notion of a Gelfand triplet
(also called rigging of a Hilbert space).
12.2.1 Eigendistributions
The chain of inclusions
S(R) ⊂L2(R) ⊂S′(R)
is called a Gelfand triplet with respect to the Hilbert space L2(R) (or a rigging of
L2(R)). Let us introduce the momentum operator
P : S(R) →S(R)
given by (Pϕ)(x) := −iℏd
dxϕ(x) and the position operator
X : S(R) →S(R)
given by (Xϕ)(x) := xϕ(x) for all x ∈R and all functions ϕ ∈S(R). For a quantum
particle on the real line, the position operator X and the momentum operator P
do not possess eigenfunctions which lie in the Hilbert space L2(R). For example,
setting ϕp(x) := eipx/ℏ/
√
2πℏ, we get
Pϕp = pϕp
for all
p ∈R,
but
R
R |ϕp(x)|2dx = ∞. Hence ϕp /∈L2(R). However, we will show that there exists
a complete system of eigendistributions.
The momentum operator. Deﬁne Fp(ϕ) :=
R
R ϕp(x)†ϕ(x)dx for all test
functions ϕ ∈S(R). Then, Fp ∈S′(R).
The family {Fp}p∈R of tempered distributions Fp forms a complete system
of eigendistributions of the momentum operator P.
Explicitly, this means the following.

676
12. Distributions and Physics
(i) Eigenvalue relation: For each real number p, we have
Fp(Pϕ) = pFp(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
(12.16)
(ii) Completeness relation: If
Fp(ϕ) = 0
for all
p ∈R
and ﬁxed ϕ ∈S(R), then ϕ = 0.
Let us prove this. Integration by parts yields
Z
R
e−ipx/ℏ(−iℏϕ′(x))dx = p
Z
R
e−ipx/ℏϕ(x)dx.
This implies (i). Moreover, in order to prove (ii) let
Fp(ϕ) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
e−ipx/ℏϕ(x)dx = 0
for all
p ∈R.
For the Fourier transform, ˆϕ(p) = Fp(ϕ) = 0. Hence ϕ = 0. Using Dirac’s notation
to be thoroughly discussed on page 680, equation (12.16) is equivalent to
P|Fp⟩= p|Fp⟩
for all
p ∈R.
Physicists brieﬂy write |p⟩instead of |Fp⟩.
The position operator. Similarly, we obtain that
The family {δx}x∈R of tempered distributions δx forms a complete system
of eigendistributions of the position operator X.
Explicitly, this means the following.
(i) Eigenvalue relation: For each number x ∈R, we get
δx(Xϕ) = xδx(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
(12.17)
(ii) Completeness relation: If δx(ϕ) = 0 for all x ∈X and ﬁxed ϕ ∈S(R), then
ϕ = 0.
This follows from δx(ϕ) = ϕ(x) and δx(Xϕ) = xϕ(x). Using Dirac’s notation to be
introduced on page 680, equation (12.17) is equivalent to
X|δx⟩= x|δx⟩
for all
x ∈R.
Physicists brieﬂy write |x⟩instead of |δx⟩.
The energy operator. Deﬁne the Hamiltonian H : S(R) →S(R) by setting
H := P 2
2me .
This is the energy operator for the free motion of an electron of mass me on the
real line.
The family {Fp}p∈R represents a complete system of eigendistributions.
Explicitly, this means the following:

12.2 Rigorous General Dirac Calculus
677
(i) Eigenvalue relation: For each real number p, we have
Fp(Hϕ) = E(p)Fp(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
(12.18)
Here, the eigenvalue E(p) := p2/2me is the energy of a free particle of momen-
tum p.
(ii) Completeness relation: If
Fp(ϕ) = 0
for all
p ∈R
and ﬁxed ϕ ∈S(R), then ϕ = 0.
Using Dirac’s notation, equation (12.18) is equivalent to
H|p⟩= E(p)|p⟩
for all
p ∈R.
12.2.2 Self-Adjoint Operators
It was discovered by John von Neumann around 1928 that the notion of self-adjoint
operator on a Hilbert space plays a fundamental role in the mathematical approach
to quantum physics. Let X be a complex Hilbert space. The operator A : D(A) →X
is called self-adjoint iﬀ
• the domain of deﬁnition D(A) is a linear subspace of the Hilbert space X which
is dense, that is, for each ϕ ∈X, there exists a sequence (ϕn) in D(A) such that
limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in X;
• the operator A is linear and formally self-adjoint, that is,
⟨ϕ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D(A);
• the two operators (A ± iI) : D(A) →X are surjective.
The operator B : D(B) →X is called essentially self-adjoint iﬀthere exists precisely
one self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →X which is an extension of B, that is,
D(B) ⊆D(A) ⊆X and Aϕ = Bϕ for all ϕ ∈D(B).
Proposition 12.2 The three operators
P, X, H : S(R) →L2(R)
(12.19)
introduced in the preceding section are essentially self-adjoint on the Hilbert space
L2(R).
The idea of proof is the following.1 We ﬁrst consider the natural extensions
P, X, H : S′(R) →S′(R)
(12.20)
where derivative and multiplication are to be understood in the sense of tempered
distributions. We then introduce the restricted domains of deﬁnition:
• D(P) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Pϕ ∈L2(R)};
• D(X) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Xϕ ∈L2(R)};
• D(H) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Hϕ ∈L2(R)}.
The corresponding restrictions of the operators from (12.20), namely,
P : D(P) →L2(R),
X : D(X) →L2(R),
H : D(H) →L2(R)
are then the desired self-adjoint extensions of the operators from (12.19).

12.2.3 The von Neumann Spectral Theorem
The classical Fourier transform sends diﬀerentiation to multiplication. This nice
property is crucial for the investigation of diﬀerential equations. John von Neumann
showed around 1930 that the Fourier transform can be generalized to self-adjoint
operators in Hilbert spaces. The two key relations read as follows:
(i) Parseval equation:
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩=
Z
M
ˆϕ(m)† ˆψ(m)dµ(m)
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈X.
(ii) Multiplication operator:
( ˆA ˆϕ)(m) = λ(m) ˆϕ(m)
for all
m ∈M
where λ : M →R is a ﬁxed function. We also set
ˆϕ(m) := (Fϕ)(m)
for all
m ∈M.
The function ˆϕ : M →C is called the generalized Fourier transform of the
element ϕ in the Hilbert space X.
A Hilbert space X is called separable iﬀthere exists a sequence ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . in X
such that for each element ϕ of X, there exists a subsequence ϕ1′, ϕ2′, . . . which
converges to ϕ in X. For example, the Hilbert space L2(RN) is separable for all
N = 1, 2, . . . .
Theorem 12.3 Let A : D(A) →X be a linear self-adjoint operator deﬁned on the
dense subset D(A) of the complex separable Hilbert space X. Then there exist both
a Hilbert space L2(M, µ) and a unitary operator
F : X →L2(M, µ)
such that the operator A is transformed into the multiplication operator ˆA given by
(ii) above.
Let us explain the precise meaning of this theorem. We start with a measure µ on
the nonempty set M. By deﬁnition, the space L2(M, µ) consists of all µ-measurable
functions
ˆϕ : M →C
such that
R
M | ˆϕ(m)|2dµ(m) < ∞. The space L2(M, µ) becomes a complex Hilbert
space with respect to the inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩:=
Z
M
ϕ(m)†ψ(m)dµ(m).
Here, two functions ϕ and ψ represent the same element of the Hilbert space
L2(M, µ) iﬀthey diﬀer on a set of µ-measure zero. Equation (ii) above is to be
understood in the sense of the following commutative diagram:
D(A)
A

F

X
F

D( ˆA)
ˆ
A  L2(M, µ).

12.2 Rigorous General Dirac Calculus
679
By deﬁnition, the function ˆϕ belongs to the set D( ˆA) iﬀ
ˆϕ ∈L2(M, µ)
and
λ ˆϕ ∈L2(M, µ).
It turns out that D( ˆA) = F(D(A)). Moreover, ˆA = FAF−1.
For the proof of Theorem 12.3, we refer to Reed, Simon (1972), Vol. 1, Sect.
VIII.3 and Berezin, Shubin (1991), supplement 1. The latter proof is elegantly based
on the Riemann–Hilbert problem.
12.2.4 The Gelfand–Kostyuchenko Spectral Theorem
We now want to consider a reﬁnement of the von Neumann spectral theorem which
generalizes the results from Sect. 12.2.1 on eigendistributions. For the dimensions
N = 1, 2, . . . we will use the Gelfand triplet
S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′(RN).
The following theorem is a special case of a general result obtained by Gelfand and
Kostyuchenko in 1955. The proof can be found in Gelfand and Shilov (1964), Vol.
4, Sect. I.4.
Theorem 12.4 Let A : S(RN) →S(RN) be a linear, sequentially continuous oper-
ator which is essentially self-adjoint with respect to the Hilbert space L2(RN). Then,
this operator has a complete system {Fm}m∈M of eigendistributions.
Explicitly, this means the following. There exists a nonempty set M such that
Fm ∈S′(RN) for all indices m ∈M.
(i) Eigendistributions: There exists a function λ : M →R such that
Fm(Aϕ) = λ(m)Fm(ϕ)
for all indices m ∈M and all test functions ϕ ∈S(RN).
(ii) Completeness: If Fm(ϕ) = 0 for all m ∈M and ﬁxed ϕ ∈S(RN), then ϕ = 0.
The function ˆϕ : M →C deﬁned by
ˆϕ(m) := Fm(ϕ)
for all
m ∈M
is called the generalized Fourier transform of the function ϕ ∈S(RN), with respect
to the operator A.
12.2.5 The Duality Map
As a preparation for the formulation of the rigorous Dirac calculus in the next
section, let us discuss the two key inclusion chains
S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′(RN)
(12.21)
and
S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′
a(RN)
(12.22)
along with the duality map

680
12. Distributions and Physics
J : L2(RN) →S′(RN)
(12.23)
and the antiduality map
Ja : S′(RN) →S′
a(RN).
(12.24)
Here, N = 1, 2, . . . . Let us summarize the relevant deﬁnitions.
(i) The Hilbert space L2(RN). Recall that the inner product on L2(RN) is given
by
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩:=
Z
RN ϕ(x)†ψ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈L2(RN).
It is our goal below to extend this inner product to more general mathemat-
ical objects called costates and generalized states. The set S(RN) of rapidly
increasing functions is dense in L2(RN).
(ii) Duality map: For each function ψ ∈L2(RN), deﬁne
J(ψ)(ϕ) := ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
For all ψ, χ ∈L2(RN) and all complex numbers α, β,
J(αψ + βχ) = α†Jψ + β†Jχ.
Moreover, if Jψ = 0, then ψ = 0. These relations tell us that the duality map
J : L2(RN) →S′(RN) is antilinear and injective.
(iii) The antiduality map. By deﬁnition, the space of antidistributions S′
a(RN)
consists of all antilinear, sequentially continuous maps2 G : S(RN) →C. For
each tempered distribution F ∈S′(RN), deﬁne
(JaF)(ϕ) := F(ϕ)†
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
Then, JaF ∈S′
a(RN). For all F, H ∈S′(RN) and all α, β ∈C,
Ja(αF + βH) = α†JaF + β†JaH.
Thus, the antiduality map Ja : S′(RN) →S′
a(RN) is antilinear and bijective.
12.2.6 Dirac’s Notation
Concerning the Gelfand triplet S(RN) ⊂L2(RN) ⊂S′(RN), let us introduce the
following terminology.
• Each function ψ ∈L2(RN) is called a state. We write |ψ⟩instead of ψ.
• Each linear functional F ∈S′(RN) is called a costate. We write ⟨F| instead of
F.
• Each antilinear functional G ∈S′
a(RN) is called a generalized state. We write
|G⟩instead of G.
2 By deﬁnition, G is antilinear iﬀG(αϕ + βψ) = α†G(ϕ) + β†G(ψ) for all complex
numbers α, β and all ϕ, ψ ∈S(RN).

12.2 Rigorous General Dirac Calculus
681
To each state ψ ∈L2(RN), we assign the costate ⟨ψ| given by the linear functional
ϕ →⟨ψ|ϕ⟩. Thus, the map
|ψ⟩→⟨ψ|
is identical to the duality map ψ →Jψ. Furthermore, to each costate ⟨F| we assign
the generalized state |F⟩given by the antilinear functional ϕ →F(ϕ)†. Thus, the
map
⟨F| →|F⟩
is equal to the antiduality map F →JaF. Let the map A : S(RN) →S(RN) be
formally self-adjoint with respect to the Hilbert space L2(RN). This means that
⟨ϕ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(RN).
We extend this by setting
⟨ϕ|A|G⟩:= ⟨Aϕ|G⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN), G ∈S′
a(RN).
This deﬁnes the generalized state A|G⟩given by the antilinear functional
ϕ →⟨Aϕ|G⟩.
In particular, ﬁx F ∈S′(RN) and the real number λ. Then, the equation
F(Aϕ) = λF(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN)
(12.25)
is equivalent to the following three equations to be considered for all functions
ϕ ∈S(RN) :
• ⟨F|Aϕ⟩= λ⟨F|ϕ⟩;
• ⟨F|Aϕ⟩† = λ⟨F|ϕ⟩†;
• ⟨Aϕ|F⟩= λ⟨ϕ|F⟩.
Therefore, equation (12.25) is equivalent to A|F⟩= λ|F⟩.
12.2.7 The Schwartz Kernel Theorem
Consider the integral operator χ = Kϕ given by
χ(x) =
Z
R2 K(x, y)ϕ(y)dy,
x ∈R.
The function K is called the kernel of the operator K. More precisely, if the function
K : R2 →C is Lebesgue measurable and
R
R2 |K(x, y)|2dxdy < ∞, then the operator
K : L2(R) →L2(R) is linear and continuous. Setting
B(ψ, ϕ) :=
Z
R2 K(x, y)ψ(x)ϕ(y)dxdy,
we obtain a bilinear functional B : S(R) × S(R) →C. The following theorem is
a far-reaching generalization of this result. It shows that a broad class of bilin-
ear functionals have tempered distributions as their generalized kernels. The key
formula reads as follows:
B(ψ, ϕ) = F(ψ ⊗ϕ)
for all
ψ ∈S(RN), ϕ ∈S(RM).
(12.26)

682
12. Distributions and Physics
Theorem 12.5 Let N, M = 1, 2, . . . , and assume that the functional
B : S(RN) × S(RM) →C
is both linear and sequentially continuous with respect to each argument. Then,
there exists a tempered distribution F ∈S′(RN+M) such that B can be represented
by (12.26).
This theorem is the special case of a general kernel theorem valid in nuclear spaces.
See Gelfand and Shilov (1964), Vol. 3, Chap. 1.
12.3 Fundamental Limits in Physics
Limits play a crucial role in physics. The idea is to approximate complicated phe-
nomena by simpler ones. For example, we have the following limits:
• high-energy limit,
• low-energy-limit,
• thermodynamic limit and phase transitions,
• adiabatic limit and regularization,
• the limit from wave optics to geometric optics for short wavelengths of light,
• the limit from Einstein’s relativistic physics to Newton’s non-relativistic physics
for suﬃciently low velocities, and
• the limit from quantum physics to classical physics for suﬃciently large action.
Let us discuss some of the basic ideas.
12.3.1 High-Energy Limit
Experiments in particle accelerators are carried out at a ﬁxed energy scale E per
particle. The high-energy limit corresponds to E →+∞. Such extremely high
energies were present in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. However,
the high-energy limit and the low-energy limit E →+0 are also crucial in quantum
ﬁeld theory in order to pass from lattices to the continuum limit. This is related to
the procedure of renormalization. For example, quarks behave like free particles at
very high particle energies.
12.3.2 Thermodynamic Limit and Phase Transitions
The most spectacular phenomena of thermodynamic systems are phase transitions.
For example, the freezing of water to ice at the temperature 0◦Celsius represents
a phase transition. Mathematically, phase transitions can be studied by singulari-
ties (e.g. jumps) of thermodynamic quantities. As a rule, such singularities do not
appear in thermodynamic systems of ﬁnite volume. One has to perform the limit
V →∞,
i.e., the volume V of the system has to go to inﬁnity. This limit is called the
thermodynamic limit. The importance of this limit in mathematical physics was
emphasized by David Ruelle in his monograph Statistical Mechanics: Rigorous Re-
sults, New York, 1969. We also recommend the survey article by Griﬃth (1972)
(rigorous results) and the monograph by Minlos (2000) (mathematical statistical

The condensation of a gas.
If one increases the pressure of a real gas at
a ﬁxed, suﬃciently low temperature, then the gas condenses into a liquid. This is
pictured schematically in Fig. 12.2. Here, p denotes the pressure, and v denotes the
speciﬁc volume (i.e., volume per molecule).
The Yang–Lee condensation model. In order to understand Fig. 12.2 in
terms of statistical physics, let us consider a purely mathematical model which is
simple, but far from physical reality.3 Let us start with the partition function

mechanics, we get the pressure p and the mean particle number per volume, N/V ,
by the formulas

subset of the unit circle. This is the mechanism for getting a phase transition at
z = 1 in the thermodynamic limit V →∞. In fact, the pressure remains continuous
at z = 1, but the speciﬁc volume v jumps at z = 1, namely,
lim
z→1+0 v(z) = 2,
lim
z→1−0 v(z) = 2
3 .
This allows us to regard the region 1 < z < ∞as gas (resp. 0 < z < 1 as liquid).
The jump of v corresponds to the condensation of the gas. This reﬂects the obvious
fact that the speciﬁc volume of a gas is larger than that of a liquid. Moreover, the
equation of state p = f(v, T ) reads as

The importance of phase transitions in high technology processes.
Phase transitions play a crucial role in understanding strange properties of matter.
For example, at suﬃciently low temperatures one observes
• superconductivity,
• superﬂuidity (e.g., liquid helium), and
• condensation of Bose–Einstein gases.
For example, Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman were awarded the Nobel prize in
physics in 2001 for the achievement of Bose–Einstein condensation in dilute gases
of alkali atoms. As an introduction to the statistical physics of these phenomena,
we recommend the classical lectures given by Feynman (1998) (14th edition).
Phase transitions in the early universe. Physicists also assume that the
cooling of the universe after the Big Bang caused several phase transitions which
were responsible for the splitting of the original uniﬁed force into gravitational,
strong, weak, and electromagnetic interaction. In the setting of the inﬂationary
theory, it is assumed that shortly after the Big Bang, a phase transition caused
an enormous sudden expansion of the universe which is responsible for the almost
ﬂatness of the present universe. Moreover, the strange properties of the ground
state of Fermi gases lead to the existence of neutron stars and white dwarfs which
possess extreme mass densities. For this, we refer to Straumann (2004).

12.3.3 Adiabatic Limit
The basic idea is to compute integrals as limits of regularized integrals. The key
formula reads as
Z ∞
0
a(t)dt = lim
ε→+0
Z ∞
0
a(t)e−εtdt.
(12.29)
This means the following. In order to compute the integral
R ∞
0
a(t)dt, we consider
the regularized integral
A(ε) :=
Z ∞
0
a(t)e−εtdt,
ε > 0,
and we compute the limit (12.29). In terms of physics, we switch on the perturbation
a(t) ⇒a(t)e−εt. For each time t ≥0,
lim
ε→+0 a(t)e−εt = a(t).
In addition, for each parameter ε > 0, limt→+∞e−εt = 1. Physicists call this adia-
batic perturbation. The point is that the adiabatic limit (12.29) does not always ex-
ist. In terms of mathematics, the function A = A(ε) is called the Laplace transform
of the given time-dependent function a = a(t). The justiﬁcation of the limit (12.29)
corresponds to sophisticated Tauberian theorems for the Laplace transform.4 As a
typical example, consider the integral

Therefore, the integral A(0) is not absolutely convergent, and hence it does not
exist as a Lebesgue integral; it is a so-called improper integral.
Newman’s adiabatic limit theorem. The following theorem due to Newman
(1980) is a crucial ingredient in the proof of the prime number theorem on page
291.
Theorem 12.6 Let a : [0, ∞[→R be a continuous (or, more generally, locally
integrable) and bounded function. Suppose that the function
A(ε) :=
Z ∞
0
a(t)e−εt dt,
ℜ(ε) > 0
extends holomorphically to an open neighborhood of the closed upper half-plane given
by {ε ∈C : ℜ(ε) ≥0}. Then, the integral
Z ∞
0
a(t)dt
is convergent. Moreover, this integral is equal to A(0).
Since the extended function A is continuous at the origin, we get
Z ∞
0
a(t)dt = lim
ε→+0 A(ε).
Proof. Our proof follows Zagier (1996). For T > 0 set
AT (z) :=
Z T

a(t)e−ztdt,
z ∈C.
This function is clearly holomorphic on the complex plane. We must show that
limT →+∞AT (0) = A(0) where A(0) denotes the extended value of the original
function ε →A(ε).
Let the radius R be a large real number and let C be the boundary of the
compact set
D := {z ∈C :
|z| ≤R, ℜ(z) ≥−δ, }
where δ > 0 is small enough (depending on R) so that the extended function A is
holomorphic on an open neighborhood of D. Then

This key formula is a special case of Cauchy’s integral formula for the representation
of a holomorphic function by its boundary values (see (4.3) page 213). We now study
the integral (12.30) on diﬀerent parts of the curve C.
(I) On the semicircle C+ := C ∩{z ∈C : ℜ(z) > 0}, the integrand is bounded
by 2B/R2, where B := supt≥0 |a(t)|, because
|A(z) −AT (z)| =

Hence the contribution to A(0) −AT (0) from the integral over C+ is bounded in
absolute value by B/R.
(II) For the integral over C−:= C ∩{z ∈C : ℜ(z) < 0}, we look at A(z)
and AT (z) separately. Since AT is holomorphic on the complex plane, the path of
integration for the integral involving AT can be replaced by the semicircle
C′
−:= {z ∈C :
|z| = R, ℜ(z) < 0},
and the integral over C′

the same estimate as before since

ℜ(z) < 0.
(III) Finally, the remaining integral over C−tends to zero as T →+∞because
the integrand is the product of the function A(z)(1 + z2

z , which is independent
of T , and the function ezT , which goes to zero rapidly and uniformly on compact
sets as T →+∞in the half-plane {z ∈C : ℜ(z) < 0}. Hence

|A(0) −AT (0)| ≤2B

Since R is arbitrary, this proves the theorem.

for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R). This implies the existence of the Fourier transform
F(Θ) as a tempered distribution. To simplify notation, we will write F(θ) instead
of F(Θ). The basic trick of our approach is to replace the Heaviside function θ by
the adiabatic approximation
θε(t) := θ(t)e−εt,
t ∈R,
and to study the limit ε →+0. In mathematics, this is called Abelian regularization
due to Abel (1802–1829). Physicists speak of adiabatic regularization introduced

12.3.4 Singular Limit
There exist the following crucial limiting processes:
(i) λ →0 (the wave length of light goes to zero): the passage from Maxwell’s theory
of electromagnetism to Fermat’s geometric optics;
(ii) ℏ→0 (the Planck constant goes to zero): the passage from quantum mechanics
to classical mechanics;
(iii) c →∞(the velocity of light goes to inﬁnity): the passage from the theory of
relativity to classical mechanics.
Since the quantities λ, ℏ, c carry physical dimensions, they depend on the choice
of the unit system. Thus, more precisely, one has to use relative dimensionless
quantities. For example, consider a physical experiment with visible light. Let L be
a typical length scale of the experiment, and let λ be the wave length of light. The
limit (i) corresponds then to
λ
L →0.
In (ii) and (iii), we need a typical velocity V and a typical action S (energy times
time), respectively, and we have to study the limits
V
c →0,
ℏ
S →0.
In daily life, we have the following typical ratios
λ
L ∼10−6,
V
c ∼10−8,
ℏ
S ∼10−34.
Here, we use the length L = 1m, the velocity V = 1m/s, and the action
S = 1kg · m · s.
Consequently, relativistic eﬀects and quantum eﬀects can be neglected in daily life,
and we can approximately apply the methods of geometric optics. For radio waves,
X rays, γ-rays, and cosmic rays, we have
λ
L ∼l
with l = 103, 10−10, 10−12, 10−15, respectively. Again, L := 1m. The singular
limits (i)-(iii) play an important role in physics. We will study them later on. For
example, the short-wavelength limit for electromagnetic waves will be investigated
in Sect. 12.5.4 on page 718. This is the prototype of a singular limit.

12.4 Duality in Physics
The concept of duality is crucial in both mathematics and physics.
Folklore
The goal is to relate apparently diﬀerent problems to each other via duality in order
to simplify the mathematical treatment.6 There exist the following fundamental
dualities in quantum physics related to the Fourier transform and the Laplace
transform:
• particles and waves,
• time and frequency,
• time and energy,
• position and momentum,
• causality and analyticity,
• strong and weak interaction.
Let us sketch the basic ideas.
12.4.1 Particles and de Broglie’s Matter Waves
De Broglies fundamental duality principle. Particles and waves are funda-
mental objects in physics for describing the transport of energy.
For quantum particles, there exists a duality between particle properties
and wave properties.
In 1905 Einstein postulated that the frequency ν and the wave length λ of an
electromagnetic light wave are related to the energy E and the momentum vector
p of the corresponding light particle (photon) by
E = hν,
p = h
λ n
with the unit vector n. Equivalently,
E = ℏω,
p = ℏk.
(12.31)
In his famous 1924 dissertation at the Sorbonne in Paris, de Broglie postulated
that the duality principle (12.31) represents a universal law in quantum physics.
In particular, he claimed that each massive or massless quantum particle possesses
wave properties. For an electron of rest mass m0 and velocity vector v, Einstein’s
theory of special relativity tells us that
p =
m0v
p
1 −v2/c2 .
Suppose that the electron moves slowly compared with the velocity of light, that is,
|v|/c ≪1. Then we get the non-relativistic approximation p = m0v. Introducing
the Compton wave length of the electron, λC := h/m0c, we obtain
λ = c
|v| λC =
c
|v| · 2.43 · 10−12m
6 A general duality theory with many application to problems in mathematics and
physics can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vols. III and IV.

12.4 Duality in Physics
691
for the wave length λ of the electron. In 1927 Davisson, Germer, Thomson, and
Reid demonstrated de Broglie’s hypothesis on the wave character of the electron
by studying the diﬀraction of electrons at crystals experimentally.7 The powerful
electron microscope is based on the wave character of the electron. The smallest
wave length of visible light is about 400 · 10−9 m = 400 nanometers. The wave
length of the electron in an electron microscope is about 5·10−9m = 5 nanometers.
Therefore, an electron microscope is much more eﬀective than a light microscope.
The enlargement factor of an electron microscope is about 1 000 000.8
The Klein–Gordon equation for matter waves. De Broglie’s matter wave
can be formally described by a complex-valued wave function
ψ(x, t) = Aei(px−Et)/ℏ
(12.32)
along with E = ℏω, p = ℏk and the Einstein relation
E2 = m2
0c4 + c2p2.
(12.33)
The latter plays the role of a dispersion relation. Diﬀerentiation of ψ yields
iℏ∂ψ
∂t = Eψ,
−iℏ∂ψ = pψ.
Consequently, if we use the substitution
E ⇒iℏ∂
∂t,
p ⇒−iℏ∂,
(12.34)
then from the Einstein relation (12.33) we obtain the so-called Klein–Gordon equa-
tion
“ 1
c2
∂2
∂2t −∂2 + m2
0c2
ℏ2
”
ψ = 0.
(12.35)
This construction guarantees that the wave function ψ from (12.32) is a solution of
the Klein–Gordon equation. Explicitly, the Klein–Gordon equation can be written
as
1
c2 ψtt −ψxx −ψyy −ψzz + m2
0c2
ℏ2
ψ = 0.
The substitution (12.34) is of great importance for quantum physics. As we will
show later on, this elegant quantization rule also generates both the Schr¨odinger
equation for non-relativistic electrons and the Dirac equation for relativistic elec-
trons.
7 Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie was awarded the 1929 Nobel prize in physics for
his discovery of the wave nature of electrons; Clinton Davisson and Sir George
Thomson were awarded the 1937 Nobel prize in physics for their electron diﬀrac-
tion experiments.
8 Ernst Ruska was awarded the 1986 Nobel prize in physics for designing the
ﬁrst electron microscope in 1933, and Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer were
awarded the 1986 Nobel prize in physics for their design of the scanning tunneling
microscope in 1981, which is based on the quantum tunneling of particles.

Quantum particle on the real line. We want to show that the Fourier trans-
form represents a duality between position and momentum in quantum mechanics
which culminates in the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. To begin with, consider
the Hilbert space L2(R) with the inner product

χ(x)†ψ(x) dx
and the norm
∥ψ∥2 := ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=

describes the state of a quantum particle on the real line where

The Gaussian distribution. The most important distribution function in
the the theory of probability is the Gaussian distribution. The central limit theo-
rem due to Chebyshev (1821–1894) tells us that, roughly speaking, the Gaussian
probability distribution always appears if the random variable under consideration
is the superposition of many independent random eﬀects. Explicitly, consider the
quantum state

between harmonic analysis and Heisenberg’s uncertainty inequality is thoroughly
discussed in the article by Feﬀerman (1983).
12.4.5 Causality and Analyticity
Linear response and causality force analyticity, and hence the Kramers–
Kronig dispersion relations.
Folklore
In the 1940s, physicists discovered that the polarization of the ground state of the
quantum ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics is responsible for crucial physical eﬀects
(e.g., the Lamb shift of the hydrogen spectrum). In the late 1950s, physicists used
dispersion relations for describing scattering processes for elementary particles via
analyticity properties of the S-matrix. This led to the emergence of string theory
in the 1970s. Let us discuss the basic ideas going back to classical electrodynamics.
The key words are
• electric dipole and polarization,
• dielectricity of material media, and
• dispersion of light.
Our goal is to discuss the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations which play a crucial
role in all physical processes which are governed by linear response and causality.
This concerns a broad class of phenomena in physics and engineering. Heisenberg’s
foundation of quantum mechanics in 1925 was strongly inﬂuenced by his joint 1924
paper with Kramers on the dispersion of light and earlier papers by Kramers.9
Generally, dispersion means that processes depend on the energy spectrum. Singu-
larities arise in the energy space which are generated by resonances. For scattering

articles edited by van der Waerden (1968).

processes of elementary particles, resonance appears for the energies of stable or
unstable bound states of particles.
The Maxwell equations for material media. The basic equations read as
div D = ϱ,
div B = 0,
∂D
∂t = curl H −J,
∂B
∂t = −curl E
(12.41)
along with the constitutive laws
P = P(E),
M = M(B)
(12.42)
and
D = ε0E + P(E),
H = 1
µ0 (B −M(B)
´
.
(12.43)
Here, we use the following notation:
• E electric ﬁeld vector,,
• B magnetic ﬁeld vector,
• ϱ electric charge density,
• J electric current density vector,
• P polarization (electric dipole moment density),
• M magnetization (magnetic dipole moment density),
• D electric intensity,
• H magnetic intensity,
• ε0 electric ﬁeld constant of a vacuum, and
• µ0 magnetic ﬁeld constant of a vacuum.
For the velocity of light in a vacuum,
c =
1
√ε0µ0 .
In the SI system, µ0 = 4π · 10−7Vs/Am. Hence ε0 = 1/µ0c2. Naturally enough, in
a vacuum we have P ≡0 and M ≡0. Therefore,
D = ε0E,
B = µ0H.
In material media, the molecules generate additional dipole moments described by
P and M which depend on the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld B. Observe
that the four Maxwell equations (12.41) are divided into two pairs of equations.
The two Maxwell equations from (12.41) which contain sources (i.e., elec-
tric charge density ϱ and electric current density vector J) depend on the
ﬁeld intensities D and H; the remaining two Maxwell equations depend on
the ﬁelds E and B.
In Volume III on gauge ﬁeld theory, we will study the relativistic formulation of
the Maxwell equations (12.41). It turns out that E and B form the electric ﬁeld
tensor in Minkowski space, whereas D and H form the Weyl density tensor. The
constitutive law (12.43) is a map of the form (E, B) →(D, H).
Energy. The conservation laws of the Maxwell equations will be thoroughly
studied in Volume III, along with conservation laws for other important ﬁeld theo-
ries in physics (like the Standard Model in particle physics and the theory of general
relativity). At this point, let us only mention that

represents the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and the Poynting vector
E × H represents the energy current density vector.
Linear material media. If we have the constitutive laws
P = χeE,
M = χmB,
then we speak of linear material media. Here, the material constants χe and χm are
called the electric and magnetic susceptibility. From the constitutive law (12.43)
we obtain a relation between the electric ﬁeld E and the electric intensity D (resp.
the magnetic ﬁeld B and the magnetic intensity H). Explicitly,
D = εE,
H = 1
µ B.
Here, ε and µ are called the electric ﬁeld constant and the magnetic ﬁeld constant
of the material medium. It follows as in Sect. 2.2.4 on page 85 that the velocity of
light in the material medium is given by
c =
1
√εµ .
It is crucial that ε and µ often depend on the angular frequency ω of the incom-
ing electromagnetic wave. This way, the velocity of light in the material medium
depends on the angular frequency, that is,
c = c(ω).
This physical eﬀect is called dispersion. As an example, consider water. For a con-
stant ﬁeld E (i.e., ω = 0), we get χe = ε0, and hence
ε = ε0 + χe = 2ε0.
For visible light, we obtain χe = 80 ε0, and hence
ε = ε0 + χe = 81ε0.
In what follows, let us study the phenomenon of dispersion.

The Maxwell equation for the electric intensity. We want to motivate
the Maxwell equation (12.45) below. To this end, consider the electric potential

By the superposition principle, this potential corresponds to an electric charge
density ϱ(y) and a dipole distribution with the polarization P(y) (electric dipole
moment density) at the point y. Suppose that the functions ϱ and P are smooth,
and that they vanish outside some ball. By the methods of classical potential theory,
the smooth function U satisﬁes the Poisson equation10
ε0∆U = ϱ −div P.
Noting that E = −grad U and ∆U = −div grad U,
10 For example, the proof of this classical result can be found in Courant and Hilbert
(1989), Vol. II.

12.4 Duality in Physics

ε0 div E = ϱ −div P.
Finally, introducing D = ε0E + P, we obtain the desired Maxwell equation
div D = ϱ.
(12.45)
Let us now translate this argument from electric ﬁelds to magnetic ﬁelds.
The Maxwell equation for the magnetic intensity. Traditionally, the po-
tential
U(x) =
mx
4πµ0r3
describes the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H = −grad U. Now equation (12.44) passes
over to

ϱmagnetic(y)

M(y)(x −y)
4πµ0∥x −y∥3 d3y
where we use the following notation:
• ϱmagnetic(y) magnetic charge density at the point y, and
• M(y) magnetization (magnetic dipole moment density) at the point y.
As above for electric ﬁelds,
µ0∆U = ϱmagnetic −div M.
Electric and magnetic charges are called electric and magnetic monopoles, respec-
tively. The experience of physicists show that
There are no magnetic monopoles in classical electrodynamics.
Hence ϱmagnetic ≡0. Letting H = −grad U, we get
µ0 div H = −div M.
Introducing the magnetic ﬁeld B = µ0H + M, we obtain the Maxwell equation
div B = 0.
(12.46)
Magnetic monopoles. There exists the hypothesis that the high energy of the
early universe caused the production of magnetic monopoles. Mathematically, the
equations of gauge ﬁeld theory possess solutions which can be regarded as general-
ized magnetic monopoles. The existence of such particles was predicted mathemat-
ically by Dirac in 1931.11 We will study this in Volume III on gauge ﬁeld theory. It
turns out that the existence of monopoles is closely related to topology. We refer

Dispersion of light. The equation
me
`¨x + 2γ ˙x + ω2

´
= −eE
describes the classical motion x = x(t) of an electron of mass me and electric charge
−e in a molecule under the inﬂuence of an oscillating external electric ﬁeld
E(t) = E0e−iωt
(12.47)
which corresponds to an electric wave of angular frequency ω. For the friction
constant γ, we assume that 0 < γ < ω0. The solution
x(t) =
e
me ·
E0e−iωt
ω2 + 2γωi −ω2

is uniquely determined by the property that it vanishes if the external ﬁeld E
vanishes. The so-called characteristic equation
ω2 + 2γωi −ω2
0 = 0
has the zeros ω± = −γi ±
p
ω2
0 −γ2 which lie in the open lower half-plane. We
assign the dipole moment
p(t) = −eℜ(x(t))
to the oscillating electron. If there are N electrons in the volume V , then we get
the polarization P(t) = Np(t)/V . Using polar coordinates, we have
1
ω2 + 2iγω −ω2
0

e−iα(ω)
|ω2 + 2γωi −ω2

Thus, we obtain the key formula for the polarization

meV |ω2 + 2γi −ω2

.
Note that the singularities of the function P = P(t) lie in the open lower half-plane.
If the friction constant γ is suﬃciently small, then we can use the approximation
γ = 0 along with α(ω) ≡0. This yields
P(t) = χe(ω)ℜ(E(t))

12.4 Duality in Physics
701
with the electric susceptibility χe(ω) = Ne2/meV |ω2−ω2
0|. For the electric intensity,
we get
D(t) = ε0E(t) + P(t) = ε(ω)E(t)
with the electric ﬁeld constant ε(ω) = ε0 + χe(ω) of the material medium. Here, in
order to simplify notation we replace ℜ(E(t)) by E(t).
Linear response and causality. Let us now describe a more general approach
based on linear response theory. We assume that the relation between the electric
ﬁeld E and the induced polarization P is given by the equation
P(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
χ(t −τ)E(τ) dτ.
(12.48)
It is important that the linear response equation (12.48) between E and P has the
following crucial additional property.
It follows from causality that χ(t) = 0 for all times t < 0.
In fact, this implies
P(t) =
Z t
−∞
χ(t −τ)E(τ) dτ,
telling us that the polarization P(t) at time t only depends on the values of the
electric ﬁeld E(τ) at the earlier time points τ ≤t.
The Fourier–Laplace transform. In order to study the function χ = χ(t), we
will use the rescaled Fourier–Laplace transform from the time space to the angular
frequency space given by
χ(t) = 1
2π
Z ∞
−∞
ˆχ(ω)e−iωtdω
for all
t ∈R
and
ˆχ(ω) :=
Z ∞
−∞
χ(t)eiωtdt,
ℑ(ω) > 0.
Suppose that χ ∈S(R). The causality condition χ(t) = 0 if t < 0 implies that the
function
ˆχ(ω) =
Z ∞
0
χ(t)eiωt dt,
ℑ(ω) > 0
is holomorphic on the open upper half-plane, and ˆχ ∈S(R) on the real line. Anal-
ogously, we introduce the rescaled Fourier–Laplace transforms
ˆE(ω) :=
Z ∞
−∞
E(t)eiωt dt,
ˆP(ω) :=
Z ∞
−∞
P(t)eiωt dt
for all
ω ∈R.
The linear response equation (12.48) can be written as the convolution
P = χ ∗E.
By the convolution rule for the Fourier transform, we get the product relation
ˆP(ω) = ˆχ(ω)ˆE(ω)
for all
ω ∈R.
(12.49)
This implies that ˆD(ω) = ˆε(ω)ˆE(ω), where ˆε(ω) := ε0 + ˆχ(ω).
The Hilbert transform and the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations.

The importance of the so-called dispersion relations (12.50) and (12.51) for physics
was discovered independently by Kramers and Kronig in 1926. Let us mention the
following two points.
(i) Energy dissipation: As a rule, the imaginary part ℑ(ˆχ) is responsible for energy
dissipation. Therefore, the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations (12.50) and
(12.51) tell us that causality restricts possible energy dissipation.
(ii) Iterative method: Starting with a reasonable ﬁrst approximation ℜ(ˆχ)0, we get
ℑ(ˆχ)0 by (12.50). In turn, this yields ℜ(ˆχ)1 by (12.51), and so on.

12.4.6 Strong and Weak Interaction
We speak of strong or weak interaction if the coupling constant κ is large or small,
respectively. In the case of weak interaction, physicists successfully use the method
of perturbation theory. As a rule, this method fails for strong interaction.
In string theory, one studies models which are based on a duality between strong
and weak interaction by using, roughly speaking, the replacement

in the framework of so-called T-duality and mirror symmetry. Physicists hope that,
in the future, this will allow us to reduce diﬃcult problems in strong interaction
to the method of perturbation theory. We refer to Zwiebach (2004), Chap. 17, and
Polchinski (1998), Vol. 2, Chap. 19.
12.5 Microlocal Analysis
Classical wave optics culminates in microlocal analysis.
Folklore
Generalizing the eﬀorts made by physicists and mathematicians in the 19th and
20th century for understanding the propagation of physical eﬀects in terms of the
Fourier transform (e.g., in optics), microlocal analysis was founded by the following

tial geometry, which is fundamental for understanding the mathematical structure
of geometric optics, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics. This will be thor-
oughly studied in Volume II. We also refer to the following monographs:

12. Distributions and Physics
In terms of wave optics, singularities appear if light rays intersect each other (focal
points) or they form an envelope line or envelope surface (caustic). The mathemat-
ical classiﬁcation of singularities including caustics can be found in the monograph:
V. Arnold, S. Gusein-Zade, and A. Varchenko, Singularities of Diﬀeren-
tiable Maps, Vols. 1, 2, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 1985.
Singularities can be handled by using the notion of a wave front set for distributions,
which is of general importance for the theory of distributions. Two crucial results
concern
• the propagation of singularities of the solutions of linear partial diﬀerential equa-
tions with smooth coeﬃcients (Theorem 12.9 on page 711) and
• the multiplication of distributions (Theorem 12.11 on page 732).
These theorems play an important role in quantum ﬁeld theory for
• analyzing the singularities of the Feynman propagator and
• renormalizing the singularities in the framework of the Epstein–Glaser approach.
This will be studied in Volume II in the physical context of quantum electrody-
namics.
H¨ormander’s notion of wave front set introduced in 1970 ﬁts the needs of
physics in an optimal way. The wave front set describes a spectral analysis
of singularities.
In what follows, let us sketch the basic ideas. The proofs can be found in H¨ormander
(1983), Vol. 1. We speak of microlocal analysis, since we will study
• the local behavior of a distribution and
• the structure of its Fourier transform at inﬁnity (the asymptotics for short wave
lengths, high frequencies, and high energies).
In the sense of the terminology introduced below, microlocal analysis is local anal-
ysis in the cotangent bundle. The creation of microlocal analysis was one of the
major achievements of the development of analysis in the 20th century. Microlocal
analysis is also important for quantum ﬁeld theory:
• It was discovered by Radzikowski (1996) in his Princeton thesis supervised by
Arthur Wightman that the methods of microlocal analysis are very useful for
quantum ﬁeld theory for characterizing so-called Hadamard states which, roughly
speaking, represent stable quantum states on curved 4-dimensional space-time
manifolds (quantum gravity).
• This idea was further developed by Brunetti, Fredenhagen, and K¨ohler (1996),
and Brunetti, Fredenhagen (2000).
12.5.1 Singular Support of a Distribution
We are given a distribution G ∈D′(RN) where N = 1, 2, . . . Recall that G vanishes
locally at the point x0 ∈RN iﬀthere exists some open neighborhood U of x0 such
that12
G(ϕ) = 0
for all
ϕ ∈D(U).
Similarly, the distribution G is called locally smooth at the point x0 ∈RN iﬀthere
exists some smooth function g : U →C on some open neighborhood U of the point
x0 such that
12 Recall that the space D(U) consists of all smooth functions ϕ : U →C which
have compact support.

12.5 Microlocal Analysis
705
G(ϕ) =
Z
RN g(x)ϕ(x)dNx
for all
ϕ ∈D(U).
Naturally enough, this leads us to the following deﬁnitions.
(a) Support supp(G) : The point x0 lies in the support of the distribution G iﬀthe
distribution is not locally zero at x0.
(b) Singular support sing supp(G) : The point x0 lies in the singular support of
the distribution G iﬀx0 ∈supp(G) and G is not locally smooth at x0.
Examples. The following examples show the relation of classical wave propa-
gation to the singular support of distributions.
(a) The Heaviside function θ : R →R has a jump at the point x = 0 (see Fig. 11.1
on page 577). Hence
supp(θ) = [0, ∞[,
sing supp(θ) = {0}.
For the Dirac delta distribution δ ∈D′(RN),
supp(δ) = sing supp(δ) = {0}.
This reﬂects the fact that the singularity of the Dirac delta function is located
at the origin.
(b) Wave propagation on the real line: Deﬁne the function
f(x, t) := θ(x −ct)
for all
(x, t) ∈R2
which describes the propagation of a discontinuity with the speed c > 0. Ex-
plicitly, the discontinuity is at the position x = ct at time t. For the wave
function f,
sing supp(f) = {(x, t) ∈R2 : x −ct = 0}.
This is a straight line in R2.
(c) Wave propagation in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space: Deﬁne
g(x, t) := θ(nx −ct)
for all
(x, t) ∈R4.
This describes the propagation of a discontinuity in direction of the given unit
vector n with the speed c > 0. The equation
nx −ct = 0,
(x, t) ∈R4
(12.52)
is called the classical wave front equation in R4. This describes a hyperplane
in R4 which is orthogonal to the 4-dimensional vector (n, −c). Note that in the
3-dimensional space of our intuition, equation (12.52) describes a plane which
moves with the velocity c in direction of its unit normal vector n. If we regard
g as a physical quantity (e.g., one component of the electric ﬁeld vector), then
this quantity jumps at the points of the moving plane. For the singular support
of the function g, we have
sing supp(g) = {(x, t) ∈R4 : nx −ct = 0}.

12.5.2 Wave Front Set
The wave front set W F(G) of a given distribution G ∈D′(RN) represents a reﬁne-
ment of the notion of singular support. The deﬁnition below will be chosen in such
a way that the following statements hold true.
(i) The wave front set W F(G) is a subset of the product set
{(x, k) : x ∈sing supp(G), k ∈RN \ {0}}.
(12.53)
Intuitively, x ∈RN and k ∈RN can be regarded as N-dimensional position
point and wave vector, respectively. Roughly speaking, large values of ||k||
correspond to small wave lengths (high energies).
(ii) If (x, k) ∈W F(G), then (x, γk) ∈W F(G) for all γ > 0 (homogeneity).
(iii) If x ∈supp sing(G), then there exists a nonzero wave vector k ∈RN such that
(x, k) ∈W F(G).
The relation to the cotangent bundle. In modern mathematics, the set
T ∗RN := {(x, k) : x ∈RN, k ∈RN}
is called the cotangent bundle of the position space {x : x ∈RN}. We also introduce
the dual pairing13
⟨k|x⟩:= kjxj,
(x, k) ∈T ∗RN,
and the diﬀerential form
Ω(k) := −kjdxj,
k ∈RN
with its derivative
dΩ= dxj ∧dkj.
The diﬀerential form dΩequips the cotangent bundle T ∗RN with a natural sym-
plectic structure. By a change of coordinates of the cotangent bundle, we mean the
matrix transformation
x′ = Ax,
k′ = (A−1)dk
where A is a real invertible (N × N)-matrix, and (A−1)d denotes the dual (or
transposed) matrix to the inverse matrix A−1. The point is that ⟨k|x⟩and Ω, −dΩ
are invariant under coordinate changes of the cotangent bundle. This means that
⟨k′|x′⟩= ⟨k|x⟩,
Ω′(k′) = Ω(k),
dΩ′ = dΩ
for all x, k ∈RN. This invariance property follows immediately from a general
mathematical principle in tensor calculus called the principle of the right index
picture (see page 769). Alternatively, an explicit computation shows that
⟨k′|x′⟩= (k′)dx′ = kdA−1Ax = kdx = ⟨k|x⟩.
Similarly, we get Ω′(k′) = Ω(k). Finally, the Cartan derivative dΩis invariant
under coordinate transformations. Hence dΩ′ = dΩ.
For ﬁxed position x, the set Fx := {(x, k) : k ∈RN} is called the ﬁber of
the cotangent bundle T ∗RN at the base point x. Intuitively, this ﬁber describes all
possible wave vectors k at the position x.
13 In what follows, we sum over equal upper and lower indices from 1 to N.

Summarizing, the wave front set of a distribution is a subset of the cotan-
gent bundle of the position space.
In terms of ﬁbers, we can write
W F(G) ⊆∪x∈supp sing(G) Fx \ {0}.
The notion of cotangent bundle is important if one wants to generalize the
notion of wave front set to functions and distributions that are deﬁned on manifolds.
Fiber bundles play a fundamental role in modern mathematics and physics. This
will be thoroughly studied in Volume III on gauge ﬁeld theory.
Prototypes. For the convenience of the reader, before giving the precise deﬁ-
nition of the wave front set, let us present some examples.
(i) Smooth functions: The wave front set of a smooth function g : RN →C is
empty.
(ii) Heaviside function: The wave front set of the function θ = θ(x) reads as
W F(θ) = {(x, k) ∈R2 : x = 0, k ∈R \ {0}}.
(iii) Dirac’s delta distribution δ in D′(RN):
W F(δ) = {(x, k) ∈RN × RN : x = 0, k ∈RN \ {0}}.
(iv) Propagation of a discontinuity: We are given the unit vector n and the velocity
c > 0. The function
g(x, t) := θ(nx −ct),
x ∈R3, t ∈R
describes the propagation of a discontinuity in direction of the vector n with
the velocity c. Set x := (x0, x) and k := (k0, k) with x0 := ct. The hyperplane
W := {x ∈R4 : nx −ct = 0}
in the 4-dimensional space-time R4 is called the classical wave front. The jumps
of the function g correspond to the points of W. The set
NW := {(x, k) ∈R4 × R4 : x ∈W, k⊥W, k ̸= 0}
is called the normal bundle of the hyperplane W. Geometrically, NW consists
of all the pairs (x, k) where x lies on the hyperplane W, and k is a nonzero
normal vector of W at the point x. This means that
⟨k|x⟩= k0x0 + kx = 0.
Explicitly, k = γ(−1, n) for all nonzero real numbers γ. We now have
sing supp(g) = W,
W F(g) = NW.
Thus, the singular support of the function g is equal to the hyperplane W
(classical wave front plane), and the wave front set of g coincides with the
normal bundle of W.

12. Distributions and Physics
(v) Let P be a plane through the origin in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space with
the normal unit vector n. Deﬁne the distribution
G(ϕ) :=
Z
P
g(x)ϕ(x)dS
for all test functions ϕ ∈D(R3) where the function g : P →C is smooth, and
dS refers to the surface area on the plane P. The wave front set of G consists
of all pairs
(x, γn)
where x lies in the support of the function g, and γ is an arbitrary nonzero
real number.
(vi) Oscillating integral (superposition of plane waves): Deﬁne
g(x) :=
Z
RN ei⟨k|x⟩a(k)dNk,
x ∈R.
We assume that the amplitude function a : RN →C is measurable (e.g.,
continuous) and
R
RN |a(k)| dNk < ∞. Then
W F(g) = {(0, k) : x ∈RN, k ∈RN \ {0}}.
The function ϕ(x, y) := ⟨x|y⟩is called phase function. In particular ϕx(x, y) = y
and ϕy(x, y) = x. The following example generalizes this situation.
(vii) Oscillating integral (caustic): Deﬁne
f(x) :=
Z
RN eiϕ(x,y) a(y) dNy.
We make the following assumptions.
• The phase function ϕ : RN × RN →R is smooth. For all x, y ∈RN and
γ > 0, we have ϕ(x, γy) = γϕ(x, y).
• (ϕx(x, y), ϕy(x, y)) ̸= 0 for all x, y ∈RN with y ̸= 0.
• The amplitude function a : RN →C is measurable (e.g., continuous) and
R
RN |a(y)| dNy < ∞.
For ﬁxed y ∈RN, the surface
ϕ(x, y) = 0,
x ∈RN
(12.54)
is called the phase surface. The critical points x of this surface are given by
ϕy(x, y) = 0.
(12.55)
The vector k is called a critical wave vector iﬀ
k = ϕx(x, y),
ϕy(x, y) = 0.
(12.56)
Then the wave front set W F(f) of the function f is given by the set of all pairs
(x, k)
with
x, k ∈RN, k ̸= 0
where the wave vector k is critical, that is, condition (12.56) is satisﬁed for
some y ∈RN. Intuitively, this is related to the phenomenon of caustic surfaces.
In fact, equation (12.54) describes a family of phase surfaces. If it is possible
to solve the equation (12.55) by y = y(x), then the equation ϕ(x, y(x)) = 0
represents the envelope surface of the surface family (12.54). The points of this
envelope surface form the caustic surfaces in geometric optics.

(viii) If G ∈D′(R), then
W F(G′) = W F(G).
For example, θ′ = δ implies W F(δ) = W F(θ).
Note that if G ∈D′(RN) with N > 1 in (viii), then the situation changes essentially.
A general result will be formulated in Theorem 12.9 on page 711.
Galaxies as gravitational lenses. Geometric optics was founded by Fermat
(1601–1665). Recently, geometric optics has also played a crucial role in quasar
astronomy. In fact, if light rays coming from a distant quasar pass through a galaxy,
then the gravitational force of the galaxy acts like a lens. For example, astronomers
observe several quasars instead of the original single quasar. This is the famous
Einstein cross. Interestingly enough, caustic eﬀects are also observed. We refer to
the monograph:
J. Ehlers, E. Falco, and P. Schneider, Gravitational Lenses, Springer, New
York, 1992.
Motivation of the wave front set. As a motivation for the general deﬁnition
below, let us consider the Heaviside function θ. By Fourier transform,
χ(x)θ(x) =

F(χθ)(k) eikxdk,

and

k ∈R.
(12.58)
Choose the ﬁxed point x0 on the real line.
• Regular case: x0 ̸= 0. In order to localize the behavior of the function θ at the
point x0, we choose a suﬃciently small neighborhood U of x0 and a function
χ ∈D(U) such that χθ ∈D(U). By the Paley–Wiener–Schwartz theorem on
page 661,
|F(χθ)(k)| = O
„ 1
|k|r
«
,
|k| →∞,
r = 1, 2, . . . .
(12.59)
That is, the Fourier transform F(χθ) decreases rapidly as the wave number |k|
goes to inﬁnity. In particular, there exists a suﬃciently large number k∞such
that the function
θk∞(x) :=
1
√
2π
Z k∞
−k∞
F(χθ)(k)eikxdk
for all
x ∈U
(12.60)
represents a reasonable approximation of the localization χθ of the function θ
near the point x0. Since the wave number k is related to the wave length λ by the
equation k = 2π/λ, formula (12.60) also represents a cutoﬀfor the wave length
near zero. That is, suﬃciently small wavelengths can be neglected.
• Singular case: x0 = 0. Now choose an open neighborhood U =]−ε, ε[ of the point
x0 and a nonnegative function χ ∈D(U). Then
F(χθ)(k) = O
„ 1
|k|
«
,
|k| →∞.
This means that, as |k| →∞, the Fourier transform does not decrease as rapidly
as in (12.59). To prove this, observe that, by the mean theorem, there exists a
number η ∈U such that

Deﬁnition of the wave front set. By an open cone C in RN, we understand
an open subset of RN \ {0} which has the additional property that
k ∈C implies γk ∈C for all γ > 0.
Motivated by the preceding example, let us base the deﬁnition of the wave front
set W F(G) of a distribution G ∈D′(RN) on the violation of the following key
condition:
|F(χG)(k)| ≤
const(r)
(1 + ||k||)r ,
r = 1, 2, . . .
(12.61)
The pair (x0, k0) with x0, k0 ∈RN and k0 ̸= 0 is called a regular microlocal pair of
the distribution G iﬀ
• there exists a test function χ ∈D(RN) with χ(x0) ̸= 0 and
• an open cone C in RN with k0 ∈C
such that the condition (12.61) is valid for all k ∈C and all indices r. This means
that the localization χG of the distribution G near the point x0 has a Fourier
transform which decays rapidly with respect to wave numbers k that lie in the
open cone C near k0.
The wave front set W F(G) consists of all pairs (x0, k0) with x0, k0 ∈RN and
k0 ̸= 0 which are not regular microlocal pairs of the distribution G.
Propagation of singularities. Choose N = 1, 2, , . . . and m = 1, 2, . . . . Let
Lu(x) :=
X
|α|≤m
aα(x)∂αu(x)
be a linear diﬀerential operator of order m = 1, 2, . . . with smooth coeﬃcients
aα : RN →C for all multi-indices α. The replacement
∂
∂xj ⇒ikj,
j = 1, . . . , N
sends the diﬀerential operator L to its symbol
P(x, k) :=

|α|≤m
aαi|α|kα,
x, k ∈RN.
The principal symbol of L is deﬁned by
Pm(x, k) :=
X
|α|=m
aαi|α|kα,
x, k ∈RN.
If the coeﬃcients aα are constants, then P(x, k) is independent of x, and Fourier
transform tells us that
F(Lu)(k) = P(k)F(u)(k)
for all
k ∈RN
and all functions u ∈S(RN). The set

12.5 Microlocal Analysis
711
Char(L) := {(x, k) ∈RN × RN : Pm(x, k) = 0, k ̸= 0}
is called the characteristic set of the diﬀerential operator L. In particular, the
diﬀerential operator L is called elliptic iﬀChar(L) is empty. The following theorem
is one of the most important theorems in the theory of linear partial diﬀerential
equations.
Theorem 12.9 We are given the distribution f ∈D′(RN). Suppose that the dis-
tribution u ∈D′(RN) is a solution of the linear diﬀerential equation
Lu = f.
Then
W F(u) ⊆W F(f) ∪Char(L).
If L is elliptic, then W F(u) = W F(f) and sing supp(u) = sing supp(f).
If we choose f = δ, then the solution G of LG = δ is a fundamental solution of
L. In this special case,
W F(G) ⊆W F(δ) ∪Char(L).
Here, W F(δ) = {(0, k) : k ∈RN \ {0}}. Observe that Green’s functions are always
fundamental solutions. As two typical examples let us consider the elliptic Pois-
son equation and the hyperbolic Klein–Gordon equation which contains the wave
equation as a special case.
The elliptic Poisson equation. This equation reads as
ε0∆U = ϱ
on
R3.
(12.62)
Here, we use a Cartesian (x, y, z)-system, and we introduce the Laplacian
∆:= −∂2
∂x2 −∂2
∂y2 −∂2
∂z2 .
The distribution ϱ = ϱ(x, y, z) describes the electric charge density, and the dis-
tribution U = U(x, y, z) represents the electrostatic potential. An electric point
charge of strength Q at the origin corresponds to
ϱ = Qδ
where δ is the Dirac delta distribution. The symbol of the Laplacian is given by
P(k) = k2
for all
k ∈R3.
Consequently, the Laplacian is elliptic. For given distribution ϱ ∈D′(R3), let the
distribution U ∈D′(R3) be a solution of the Poisson equation (12.62). Then, for
the wave front sets,
W F(U) = W F(ϱ).
For the singular support,
sing supp(U) = sing supp(ϱ).
In particular, if the electric charge density ϱ : R3 →R is smooth, then so is the
electrostatic potential U, since the singular supports of ϱ and U are empty. In the

712
12. Distributions and Physics
special case of a point charge at the origin, ϱ = Qδ, the singular support of ϱ is
equal to the origin , and so is the singular support of the corresponding electrostatic
potential U. Explicitly,
U(x) =
Q
4πε0||x|| + V (x)
for all
x ∈R3, x ̸= 0.
Here, the function V is an arbitrary smooth solution of the homogeneous equation
∆V = 0 on R3.

Here, we use the following notation: ψ = ψ(x, y, z, t) is the wave function of the
Yukawa meson of rest mass m0 > 0, c is the velocity of light in vacuum, h is the
Planck constant, and ℏ:= h/2π. In the special case where m0 = 0, the Klein–
Gordon equation passes over to the wave equation

on

(12.64)
where the distributions ϱ = ϱ(x, y, z, t) and U = U(x, y, z, t) are the time-dependent
electric charge density and electric potential, respectively.
Set x := (x0, x) and k := (k0, k) where x0 := ct. Using the replacement
∂
∂xj ⇒ikj,
j = 0, 1, 2, 3,
we assign the symbol
P(x, k) := −k2

to the Klein–Gordon equation. By deﬁnition, the critical set Char(2+

Klein–Gordon operator is equal to the set of all the pairs
(x, k) ∈R4 × R4
with
P(x, k) = −k2

The solutions x = x(τ), k = k(τ) of the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
˙x = Pk(x, k),
˙k = Px(x, k)
are called the bicharacteristics of the Klein–Gordon equation. Explicitly,
˙x0 = −2k0,
˙xj = 2kj,
˙kl = 0,
j = 1, 2, 3, l = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Therefore, the bicharacteristics are straight lines of the form
k0, kj = const,
x0(τ) = −2k0τ + x0(0),
xj(τ) = 2kj(τ) + xj(0)

for all τ ∈R and j = 1, 2, 3. Using the energy E and the momentum vector
p := p1e1 + p2e2 + p3e3 with respect to the right-handed orthonormal system
e1, e2, e3, physicists introduce the 4-momentum
p = ℏk
along with p0 = p0 := E/c and pj = −pj if j = 1, 2, 3. Then, the point (x, k) lies
in the characteristic set of the Klein–Gordon equation iﬀwe satisfy the Einstein
energy-momentum equation
E2 = c2m2
0 + c2p2.
This equation describes the so-called mass shell in the energy-momentum space
corresponding to the mass parameter m0. For m0 = 0, the mass shell E2 = c2p2 is
the counterpart to the light cone
c2t2 = x2,
x ∈R3, t ∈R.
For a given distribution χ ∈D′(R4), let ψ ∈D′(R4) be a solution of the Klein–
Gordon equation. Then, for the wave front set, we have the following two properties:

(ii) Let f = 0. If the point (x, k) lies in the wave front set W F(u), then the same
is true for all points of the bicharacteristics through the point (x, k).
In terms of physics, the appearance of the critical set Char(2 +

to the propagation of discontinuous wave fronts. This phenomenon does not appear
for the Poisson equation, since this equation describes stationary processes.

and the backward light cone C−:= {(x, t) ∈R4 : t ≤0, ||x||2 = c2t2}. Observe
that the retarded (resp. advanced) distribution F+ (resp. F−) only depends on the
values of the test function ϕ on the forward (resp. backward) light cone.
Mnemonically, this is obtained as follows. For ﬁxed time t, the light-cone equa-
tion c2t2 −r2 = 0 has the zeros r = ±ct. By Sect. 11.2.4 on page 595,

12.5.3 The Method of Stationary Phase
The method of stationary phase has its roots in wave optics. Nowadays
it is a magic tool in the hands of Edward Witten for studying quantum-
ﬁeld models in terms of the Feynman functional integral and for producing
deep topological invariants. Here, the Feynman functional integral plays
the role of a generating functional.

Rapidly oscillating integrals. In physics, one frequently encounters integrals
which posses an integrand that oscillates with high frequency. The integral repre-
sents the mean value over a high-frequency process in nature or technology, and the
task is to compute such mean values. Alternatively, one has to compute integrals
which represent the mean value over short-wave processes. In quantum mechanics,
one encounters integrals of the type

eiS(x)/ℏa(x)dx
In the semiclassical case, the Planck constant h and hence ℏ:= h/2π can be assumed
to be small. The Feynman functional integral
Z

eiS(ψ)/ℏD(ψ)
is also of this type. Here X denotes the space of all quantum ﬁelds ψ, and the
symbol D stands for a formal measure on the space X.

Here, we use the following notation: t time, x space variable, E energy, and p
momentum. Small values of ε correspond to situations where the angular frequency
ω is high, the wave length λ is small, or the Planck’s constant of action h is small.

It is not obvious at ﬁrst that these integrals are convergent. In fact, each of the
integrands oscillates, and it turns out that many of the positive and negative con-
tributions to the integral cancel each other. For the computation of these integrals
via Cauchy’s famous residue method, see Problems 12.2 and 12.3.
The Dirichlet integral played a key role in the classical convergence theory for
both Fourier series and Fourier integrals due to Dirichlet (1805–1859).16 Dirichlet

{δε}ε>0 represents a forerunner of Dirac’s delta function introduced by Dirac around
1930. For small parameter ε > 0, the function δε is only concentrated near the
origin. The method of stationary phase below will allow us to construct many such
functions which possess the crucial property of concentration. Such function always
appear for physical processes which are focused. A typical example of focusing is
the patterns obtained by diﬀraction of light at a small slit.
The Fresnel integrals were used by Fresnel (1788–1827) in order to compute
sophisticated second-order diﬀraction eﬀects for light (see Sect. 12.5.5). Introducing

Our goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of this integral as ε →+0. The method
of stationary phase due to Lord Kelvin (1824–1907) tells us that the main contri-
butions come only from momenta p for which the phase function ϕ is stationary,
that is,
ϕ′(p) = 0.
We assume that both the amplitude function a : Rn →C and the phase function
ϕ : Rn →R are smooth, and that the amplitude function a has compact support.

12.5.4 Short-Wave Asymptotics for Electromagnetic Waves
Let us study the singular limit, λ →0, where the wave length of light goes to zero.
We want to explain the relations between the following diﬀerential equations:
• the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
• the wave front equation for the Maxwell system (characteristics),
• the characteristics of the wave front equation (bicharacteristics of the Maxwell
system which correspond to light rays),
• the wave front equation (characteristics) for the wave equation,
• short waves, the eikonal equation, and the transport equations,
• Fermat’s principle of shortest travelling time for light, the Euler–Lagrange equa-
tions for light rays, the Hamilton canonical equations along with the Hamilton–
Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation.
We start with the Maxwell equations
ε div E = ϱ,
div B = 0,
curl E = ˙B,
curl B = µJ + εµ ˙E.
(12.70)
These equations refer to homogeneous and isotropic material with electric ﬁeld
constant ε and magnetic ﬁeld constant µ. Moreover, the quantities possess the
following physical meaning: electric ﬁeld E, magnetic ﬁeld B, electric charge density
ϱ, electric current density vector J. Let c = 1/√ε0µ0 denote the velocity of light in
a vacuum. The velocity of light in the material is then given by
cmat =
1
√εµ = n
c .
Here, n is called the refractive index of the material. We are ﬁrst looking for wave
fronts given by the equation
χ(x, t) = const
such that discontinuities of the electric ﬁeld E or the magnetic ﬁeld B propagate
along this wave front. It turns out that the function χ has to satisfy the wave front
equation
c2
mat(grad χ)2 = ˙χ2
(12.71)
or ˙χ = 0. The dot denotes partial derivative with respect time t. This equation is
also called the characteristic equation to the Maxwell equations.18 Special solutions
of the wave front equation are
18 The characteristic equations for systems of partial diﬀerential equations and their
applications to basic problems in mathematical physics are considered in Zeidler
(2004), Sect. 1.13.3. See also Smirnov (1964), Vol. 4, Sect. III.3.

χ(x, t) := ex −cmatt
where e is a ﬁxed unit vector, and
χ(x, t) :=
p
x2 + y2 + z2 −cmatt.
The equation χ(x, t) = const describes then the propagation of both plane waves
(in direction of the vector e) and spherical waves with the velocity cmat.
(a) Plane waves: We are given the unit vector e. Suppose that ϱ ≡0, J ≡0 (no
external electric charges and no external electric currents). Then, the Maxwell
equations possess the following solutions:19
E(x, t) := E0eikex−iωt,
B(x, t) := B0eikex−iωt.
(12.72)
This electromagnetic wave propagates in direction of e with the velocity cmat.
The constant vector E0 cannot be prescribed completely arbitrarily; it has to
be perpendicular to the direction e of propagation (transversal wave). Further-
more,
B0 =
1
cmat (e × E0).
The plane wave has the wave length
λ = 2π

where k is called the wave number. For the relation between frequency ν,
angular frequency ω, and velocity of propagation cmat, we get the so-called
dispersion relation
ν = ω

(b) Spherical waves: Let r := ||x|| and er := x/r. The homogeneous wave equation

x ∈R3, t > 0,
and

called outgoing and incoming spherical waves, respectively. We are given the
smooth function w :]0, ∞[→R. In order to get such types of waves for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, we use the scalar potential U and the vector potential
potential A which satisfy the wave equations

is a solution of the Maxwell equations (12.70).
(c) The Hertz dipole (the electromagnetic ﬁeld of an antenna): Consider a negative
electric charge −Q at the origin and a positive electric charge Q at the position
x(t) near the origin at time t. Introduce the dipole moment
d(t) := Qx(t).
This situation generates an electromagnetic ﬁeld. At large distances from the
origin, this electromagnetic ﬁeld looks approximately like

the wave equations

mat∆B = 0.
However, the converse is not true. Making the ansatz
E(x, t) = eiωt E0(x),
B(x, t) = eiωt B0(x),
and using the the wave equations, we obtain the Helmholtz equations
∆E0 = k2E0,
∆B0 = k2B0
where k = ω/cmat. In order to study the short-wave asymptotics of the solutions of
the Maxwell equations, we now make the crucial ansatz

equation and equating coeﬃcients, we obtain the nonlinear ﬁrst-order eikonal equa-
tion

for the amplitude E0. The remaining amplitudes E1, E2, . . . follow recursively from
the linear ﬁrst-order transport equations
Er∆S −2 grad S grad Er = ∆Er−1,
r = 1, 2, . . .
Replacing the electric ﬁeld E by the magnetic ﬁeld B, we get analogous formu-
las. This way, we obtain approximate solutions of the Maxwell equations (12.70)
which describe short electromagnetic waves. The limit case λ →0 corresponds to
geometric optics founded by Fermat (1601–1665). We now want to discuss that
There exists a duality between wave fronts and light rays which can be
traced back to Huygens (1625–1695).
This duality was fully developed by the following authors:
• Cauchy (1789–1857) (solution theory for ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations
via characteristic curves),
• Hamilton (1805–1865) (canonical equations),
• Jacobi (1804–1851) (Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation),
• Lie (1842–1899) (contact transformations),
• Hilbert (1862–1943) (invariant integral),
• Poincar´e (1854–1912) and ´Elie Cartan (1859–1951) (integral invariants),
• Carath´eodory (1873–1950) (ﬁeld theory and the royal road to the calculus of
variations), and
• H¨older (1901–1990) (H¨older’s contact transformation and the Huygens principle).
We will study this in Volume II. It turns out that:
• Wave fronts are related to the Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation
(eikonal equation), whereas
• light rays are described by the Euler–Lagrange ordinary diﬀerential equations to
the Fermat variational principle (and, alternatively, by the Hamilton canonical
equations.) The eikonal is the minimal time that is need by light in order to pass
from a ﬁxed point (e.g., the origin) to all the other points.
• In the 1950s, this duality played a fundamental role in the foundations of op-
timal control for dynamical systems. Bellman (1920–1984) based his dynamic
programming on the notion of wave fronts (the Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equa-
tion), whereas Pontryagin (1908–1988) invented his maximum principle which is
related to light rays (the canonical Hamilton–Pontryagin equations).20
In terms of mathematics,
• the wave fronts of the Maxwell equations correspond to solutions of the charac-
teristic equation of the Maxwell system, and
20 These interrelationships between the calculus of variations and optimization the-
ory are thoroughly investigated in Zeidler (1986), Vol. 3.

light rays

Fig. 12.5. Light rays and wave fronts
• the light rays correspond to the solutions of the bicharacteristic system, which
is Cauchy’s characteristic system to the characteristic equation of the Maxwell
system.
Let us sketch some basic ideas. To simplify notation, we rescale time in such a way
that
cmat := 1.
The wave front equation (12.71) is a ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equation. Ac-
cording to Cauchy, to each such equation there exists a characteristic system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations.21 Explicitly, if χ is a solution of the wave front
equation (12.71), then the solutions of the following system
˙x(τ) = −grad χ(x(τ), t(τ)),
˙t(τ) = χt(x(τ), t(τ))
(12.77)
for all τ ∈R are called characteristics of the wave front equation or bicharacteristics
of the Maxwell system.22 Now consider a solution S = S(x) of the eikonal equation
(12.74). Then
χ(x, t) := t −S(x)
is a solution of the wavefront equation (12.71). Then χt = 1. Thus, t = τ, and the
corresponding bicharacteristics have the form
˙x(t) = −grad S(x(t)),
t ∈R.
21 Let x ∈Rn. Recall that for a solution ψ = ψ(x) of the ﬁrst-order partial diﬀer-
ential equation
F(x, ψ(x), ψ′(x)) = 0,
(12.75)
Cauchy’s characteristic curve system reads as
˙x = Fψ′,
˙p = −Fx −pFψ,
˙ψ = ψ′Fψ′.
(12.76)
Here, the symbol ψ′ stands for the tupel of ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of ψ and
the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the curve parameter. Explicitly,
˙x(τ) = Fψ′(x(τ), ψ(x(τ)), ψ′(x(τ))),
τ ∈R,
and so on. The characteristics can be used in order to construct solutions ψ(x)
of (12.75). See Zeidler (2004), Sect. 1.13.3.
22 Naturally enough, it turns out that the wave front equation (12.71) is also the
characteristic equation to the wave equation (12.73).

12.5 Microlocal Analysis
723
At ﬁxed time t, the wave front t −S(x) = const has the normal vector grad S(x)
at the point x. This tells us the crucial fact that
The bicharacteristics are orthogonal to the wave fronts (Fig. 12.5).
For a given wave front S(x) = 0, we construct the family of wave fronts
t −S(x) = 0
which move with velocity one. The corresponding light rays are perpendicular to
the wave fronts. They are straight lines. This simple construction is precisely the
special case of Cauchy’s general method of characteristics for solving the wave front
equation (12.71).
We now want to discuss the relation to both Fermat’s classical principle of
shortest travelling time for light and the Hamilton–Jacobi theory.
(i) Fermat’s principle: Consider the variational problem
Z x1
0
p
1 + y′(x)2dx = min!
(12.78)
with the boundary condition y(0) = 0, y(x1) = y1. We are looking for a curve
y = y(x) which connects the initial point (0, 0) with the end point (x1, y1) such
that the arc length is minimal. Since the velocity of light is assumed to be equal
to 1, we are looking for a light ray which connects the two points in shortest
time. This is Fermat’s principle. Intuitively, the solution must be a straight
line. Rigorously, let us apply the mathematical formalism of the calculus of
variations.
(ii) The Euler–Lagrange equation: Introducing the Lagrangian,
L(x, y, y′) :=
p
1 + y′2,
each solution of (12.78) satisﬁes the Euler–Lagrange equation
d
dxLy′ = Ly.
(12.79)
This means that y′′/
p
1 + y′2 = 0, and hence y′′ = 0. Thus, the solutions are
straight lines.
(iii) Hamilton’s canonical equations: Introducing the momentum p := Ly′ and the
Hamiltonian
H(x, y, p) := py′ −L(x, y, y′) = −
p
1 −p2,
the Euler–Lagrange equations are transformed into
˙p = −Hy,
˙y = −Hp.
(12.80)
The dot denotes the derivative with respect to the curve parameter x.
(iv) The Hamilton–Jacobi diﬀerential equation: Let us deﬁne the eikonal S(x1, y1).
This is the time needed by a light ray which travels from the point (0, 0) to
the point (x1, y1). Explicitly,
S(x, y) =
p
x2 + y2.
Thus, S is a solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi diﬀerential equation
Sx + H(x, S, Sy) = 0.
(12.81)
In fact, S2
x + S2
y = 1.

724
12. Distributions and Physics
Note that the canonical equations (12.80) correspond to Cauchy’s characteristic
curve equations (12.77) for the Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation.
The experience of physicists and mathematicians has been that this method
can be applied to a broad class of problems in classical mechanics and geometry.
We refer to Zeidler (1986), Vols. 3 and 4, Arnold (1978), Scheck (2000), Vol. 1,
Boccaletti and Pucacco (1998), Vols. 1, 2 (theory of orbits in celestial mechanics).
12.5.5 Diﬀraction of Light
Diﬀraction problems for light were studied by Fraunhofer (1787–1826),
Fresnel (1788–1827), Helmholtz (1821–1894), Kelvin (1824–1907), Kirch-
hoﬀ(1824–1887), Rayleigh (1842–1919), Poincar´e (1854–1912), and Som-
merfeld (1868–1951). In his famous lectures on light, Poincar´e used Kelvin’s
method of stationary phase. In the 20th century, the rigorous mathemat-
ical treatment of diﬀraction problems was a challenge for the theory of
integral equations. The Kirchhoﬀ–Green representation formula is closely
related to the Born approximation and the Lippmann–Schwinger integral
equation for scattering processes in quantum physics. The Feynman path
integral from the 1940s generalizes wave optics.
Folklore
We want to sketch some basic ideas in diﬀraction theory. In particular, we want to
show why rapidly oscillating integrals (e.g., Fresnel integrals) arise in connection
with the diﬀraction of light.
The Kirchhoﬀ–Green representation formula for the Helmholtz equa-
tion. Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open connected set in the 3-dimensional Eu-
clidean space such that cl(Ω) is a manifold with boundary. For a ﬁxed real wave
number k, let E be a solution of the Helmholtz equation
∆E −k2E = 0
on

(12.82)
which is smooth up to the boundary, E ∈C∞(Ω). Then the function E satisﬁes
the following Kirchhoﬀ–Green representation formula

∂n
−∂G(x1 −x)
∂n
E(x) dS
(12.83)
for all points x1 ∈Ω. We integrate over x. This equation is fundamental for ap-
proximatively solving diﬀraction problems for light and sound. Here, we use the
Helmholtz potential
G(x) := e−ikr
4πr
with r := ||x||, and k = 2π/λ. For k = 0, the Helmholtz potential passes over to
the Coulomb potential. Note that
∆G −k2G = δ,
in the sense of distributions (see Problem 10.8). In modern language,the Helmholtz
potential is a Yukawa potential with imaginary mass m := ik.The Kirchhoﬀ–Green
representation formula is a precise formulation of the Huygens principle: The value
of the component E(x1) of the electric ﬁeld at the point x1 is obtained by a super-
position of “waves” related to G which start at the boundary points x ∈∂Ω. For

is called Sommerfeld’s outgoing radiation condition. Mnemonically, the Helmholtz
potential G has precisely this asymptotic behavior at inﬁnity. This condition guar-
antees the uniqueness of the boundary-value problem for the Helmholtz equation.
To explain this, suppose that, for ﬁxed k ∈R, we are given a smooth function
E0 : ∂Ω→C. Then the following are met:
(i) Internal boundary-value problem: The Helmholtz equation (12.82) has precisely
one smooth solution E : Ω∪∂Ω→C which attains the given values E0 on the
boundary ∂Ω.
(ii) External boundary-value problem: The Helmholtz equation (12.82) has pre-
cisely one solution
E : R3 \ Ω→C
which attains the given values E0 on the boundary Ωand which satisﬁes Som-
merfeld’s outgoing radiation condition.
In the 20th century, mathematicians learned how to solve such elliptic problems
which generalize the corresponding problems for the Laplace equation. There exist
the following methods:
(a) Integral equations (see Kupradse (1956), Smirnov (1964), and Triebel (1989));
(b) Hilbert space methods, Sobolev spaces, and the regularity properties of gener-
alized solutions (see Zeidler (1986), Vols. IIA, IIB, Zeidler (1995), Vol. I, Chap.
2, Evans (1998), and Jost (2002b));
(c) Schauder estimates and the continuation method (see Zeidler (1986), Vol. I,
Chap. 6, and Jost (2002b)).
This program was initiated by Hilbert’s problem number twenty that he formulated
in his famous 1900 Paris lecture (see Hilbert (1900)).
The slit formula. We now want to apply the Kirchhoﬀ–Green representation
formula in order to approximately solve a diﬀraction problem for light as pictured

Electromagnetic light waves start at the source point x0; they pass through an
arbitrary point x of the slit, and they are observed at the point x1. We choose
x0 := −r0i,
x1 := x1i + y1x2 + z1k.
Furthermore, we introduce the unit vectors e0 := x0/r0 and e1 := x1/r1. We
want to compute the electromagnetic ﬁeld E(x1), B(x1) at the ﬁnal point x1. More
precisely, we are interested in the intensity of the light given by the energy density
I := 1
2ε(|E(x)|2 + c2
mat|B(x)|2)
at the point x. To simplify the approach, we restrict ourselves to a ﬁxed component
of the electric harmonic waves
E(x) = E0(x)e−iωt
with angular frequency ω. For the wave number and the wave length, we have
k =
ω
cmat ,
λ = 2π
k = cmat
ω .
Here, cmat is the velocity of light in the medium (e.g., air). For example, we set
E(x) := (E0)y(x),
that is, we study the y-component of the electric ﬁeld. Then, E is a solution of the
Helmholtz equation (12.82). Since E will be complex-valued, we will measure the
intensity of light I at the point x by the quantity
I = ε
2 |E(x)|2.
Physical experiments show that diﬀraction patterns may look rather complicated.
Our approximate approach is based on the following assumptions.
(a) The source point x0 sends a wave E(x) = G(x −x0) to the point x of the slit.
(b) The wave observed at the ﬁnal point x1 only depends on the light that comes
from the points x of the slit Σ. By the Kirchhoﬀ–Green representation formula,
E(x1) =

This is the desired formula for the electric ﬁeld component E(x1) at the point
x1 of the observer.
(c) To simplify the approximate computation of the integral for E(x1), we assume
that

that is, the width of the slit a, b is of the magnitude of the wave length λ, and

12.5.6 Pseudo-Diﬀerential Operators
To explain the basic idea, consider the linear diﬀerential operator
(Lu)(t) := a(t) dk
dtk u(t),
t ∈R
of order k = 1, 2, . . . with smooth coeﬃcient function a : R →R. For all functions
u ∈S(R), we have the Fourier transform
u(t) =
1
√
2π
Z
R
eiωtF(u)(ω)dω.
Hence
(Lu)(t) =

√
2π
Z
R
eiωts(t, ω)F(u)(ω)dω
where the smooth function
s(t, ω) := a(t)(iω)k,
t, ω ∈R
is called the symbol of the diﬀerential operator L. Generally, a pseudo-diﬀerential
operator P is given by an expression of the form
(Pu)(x) :=
1
p
(2π)n
Z
Rn ei⟨x|p⟩s(x, p)F(u)(p) dnp,
x ∈Rn.
The theory of pseudo-diﬀerential operators studies the properties of such operators
in terms of the properties of the symbol s(x, p). For example,
• linear partial diﬀerential operators with smooth coeﬃcient functions and
• important classes of regular and singular integral operators
are pseudo-diﬀerential operators. In the history of mathematics and physics, ef-
forts were made to reduce the solution of diﬀerential equations to the solution of
simpler algebraic problems. Such eﬀorts are due to Leibniz (1646–1716), Laplace
(1749–1827), Fourier (1768–1830), and the British engineer Heaviside (1850–1925)
to mention a few names. Nowadays this development has culminated in the theory
of pseudo-diﬀerential operators.
12.5.7 Fourier Integral Operators

Z
Rn eiϕ(x,p) s(x, p)F(u)(p) dnp,
x ∈Rn.
Here, we assume that the phase function ϕ : Rn × Rn →R has the following
properties:
(i) Homogeneity: ϕ(x, λp) = λϕ(x, p) for all λ > 0 and all x, p ∈Rn.
(ii) Smoothness: ϕ(x, p) is smooth for all x, p ∈Rn with p ̸= 0.
(iii) Nondegeneracy: ϕx(x, p) ̸= 0 for all x, p ∈Rn with p ̸= 0.

12.6 Multiplication of Distributions
729
Observe that the conditions (i)-(iii) are satisﬁed in the special case where the phase
function is given by ϕ(x, p) := ⟨x|p⟩.
Typical application. Consider the initial- value problem for the wave equa-
tion:
Utt(x, t) + ∆U(x, t) = 0,
x ∈R3, t ≥0
U(x, 0) = U0(x),
Ut(x, 0) = U1(x),
x ∈R3.
We are given the smooth functions U0, U1 : R3 →R with compact support. Then
there exists a unique smooth solution given by

where V0 and V1 are the Fourier transform of U0 and U1, respectively. Note that the
solution U is represented as the sum of two Fourier integral operators. To motivate
this formula, let us use the classical Fourier method. To begin with, we introduce
the Fourier transform of U with respect to the variable x,
V (x, t) =

The wave equation implies
Vtt(p, t) = −p2V (p, t)

V (p, t) = 1

It turns out that
Fourier integral operators play a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory
for describing the propagation of physical eﬀects.
Recommendations for further reading on both pseudo-diﬀerential operators and
Fourier integral operators can be found on page 703.
12.6 Multiplication of Distributions
In a naive setting of quantum ﬁeld theory, one encounters the square δ(x)2 of
Dirac’s delta function when computing cross sections of scattering processes. In
1954 Laurent Schwartz showed that it is not possible to construct a perfect theory
of products FG for distributions F, G ∈D′(R) without leaving the space D′(R) of
distributions.

12.6.1 Laurent Schwartz’s Counterexample
Intelligence consists of this; that we recognize the similarity of diﬀerent
things and the diﬀerence between similar ones.
Baron de la Br`ede et de Montesquieu (1689–1755)
Consider the space D(R) of smooth functions ϕ : R →C which have compact
support, and let D′(R) be the corresponding space of distributions. To each function
f ∈D(R), there can be assigned a unique distribution F given by
F(ϕ) :=
Z
R
f(x)ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ ∈D(R).
With respect to the usual product fg of functions, the space D(R) is a commutative
and associative algebra with Leibniz rule. Explicitly, this means the following:
(i) Linearity: D(R) is a complex linear space.
(ii)) Product: If f, g ∈D(R), then there exists a product fg ∈D(R).
(iii)) Distributivity: f(αg +βh) = αfg +βfh for all f, g, h ∈D(R) and all complex
numbers α, β.
(iv) Commutativity: fg = gf for all f, g ∈D(R).
(v) Associativity: (fg)h = f(gh) for all f, g, h ∈D(R).
(vi) Leibniz rule: The derivative D is a linear operator on D(R), and we have
D(fg) = (Df)g + f(Dg)
for all
f, g ∈D(R).
The following theorem was proved by Laurent Schwartz.23
Theorem 12.10 It is not possible to equip the complex linear space D′(R) of distri-
butions with a product such that it becomes a quite natural extension of the function
algebra D(R).
More precisely, the function algebra D(R) cannot be extended to a commutative
and associative algebra D′(R) with Leibniz rule
D(FG) = (DF)G + F(DG)
for all
F, G ∈D′(R),
where D denotes the usual derivative for distributions.
Proof. We will argue by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a product on
D′(R) which has the desired properties, that is, there hold true the distributive law,
the commutative law, the associative law, and the Leibniz rule.
(I) The Dirac delta functional. The basic trick is to consider the following func-
tions:
• f(x) := x and g(x) := |x| for all x ∈R.
• h(x) := ln |x| −1 for all x ∈R \ {0}.
Classically, the derivative (x|x|)′ = 2|x| exists for all x ∈R. Hence
Df = 1
and
D(fg) = 2g.
Using the Heaviside function θ, we get
Dg = −1 + 2θ
and hence
D2g = 2δ.

Rendus Acad. Sci. Paris 239 (1954), 847–848.

12.6 Multiplication of Distributions
731
To obtain the desired contradiction, we will show that our assumption implies
D2g = 0.
(12.85)
(II) By the presupposed Leibniz rule on D′(R),
D(fg) = (Df)g + fDg = g + fDg.
Thus, again by the Leibniz rule,
D2(fg) = 2Dg + fD2g.
(12.86)
On the other hand, from D(fg) = 2g we get D2(fg) = 2Dg. Combining this with
(12.86), we obtain the key relation
fD2g = 0.
This yields the desired equation (12.85) if the following claim is true for all distri-
butions G ∈D′(R) :
fG = 0
implies
G = 0.
(12.87)
It remains to prove (12.87).
(III) Observe that (12.87) follows from
fD2(fh) = 1.
(12.88)
In fact, if fG = 0, then Gf = 0, by commutativity. Associativity tells us that
0 = GfD2(fh) = G · 1,
and hence G = 0. It remains to prove (12.88).
(IV) Proof of (12.88). Classically, (x2(ln |x| −1))′ = 2x(ln |x| −1) + x for all
x ∈R. Equivalently,
D(f 2h) = 2fh + f.
(12.89)
By the presupposed Leibniz rule on D′(R) along with Df = 1, we obtain
D(f 2h) = D(f · fh) = fh + fD(fh).
Therefore, by the Leibniz rule, D2(f 2h) = 2D(fh) + fD2(fh), and hence
fD2(fh) = D2(f 2h) −2D(fh).
Finally, again by the Leibniz rule, it follows from (12.89) that
fD2(fh) = 2D(fh) + 1 −2D(fh) = 1.

12.6.2 H¨ormander’s Causal Product
Causality is crucial for quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
Based on his notion of the wave front set of a distribution, H¨ormander proved the
following theorem in 1970.
Theorem 12.11 It is possible to deﬁne the product GH of two given distributions
G, H ∈D′(RN) if the wave front sets W F(G) and W F(H) possess the following
crucial momentum property:
(x, k) ∈W F(G),
always implies
(x, −k) /∈W F(H).
(12.90)
It turns out that this condition is satisﬁed in the Epstein–Glaser approach to quan-
tum ﬁeld theory, because of the validity of the causality principle for the S-matrix.
This will be thoroughly studied in Volume II on quantum electrodynamics.
For two functions g, h ∈D(RN), we have the convolution rule for the Fourier
transform:
F(gh) =
1
(2π)N/2 · F(g) ∗F(h).
Naturally enough, the product GH is given in a similar way after localization.
Explicitly, for each point x ∈RN there exists a function χ ∈D(RN) such that χ = 1
in some open neighborhood of x, and for the Fourier transform of the localizations
we have the convolution rule
F(χ2GH) =
1
(2π)N/2 · F(χG) ∗F(χH).
(12.91)
As a counterexample, consider the Dirac delta distribution δ on R. For the wave
frontset
W F(δ) = {(0, k) : k ∈R, k ̸= 0}.
Therefore, condition (12.90) is violated for G = H := δ. In this case, it is not
possible to deﬁne the product δ2.
The theory of products for distributions can be found in Reed and Simon (1972),
Vol. II, Sect. IX.10, and in H¨ormander (1983), Vol. I, Sect. 8.2. In order to get a
general theory of products, one has to extend the class of Schwartz distributions
to a broader class of generalized functions. In this connection, we refer to the
monographs:
J. Colombeau, New Generalized Functions and Multiplication of Distribu-
tions, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1984.
M. Oberguggenberger, Multiplication of Distributions and Applications to
Partial Diﬀerential Equations, Longman, Harlow, 1992.

12.9 The jump trick for ordinary diﬀerential equations. Let a, b, c : R →C be given

on
R2
with the initial conditions g(0) = 0 and g′(0) = 1. Show that the function
q(t) := θ(t)g(t)
for all
t ∈R
satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
aq′′ + bq′ + cq = aδ
on
R2,
in the sense of distributions.
Solution: Let us start with a formal argument. Since q(0) = 0, qδ = 0. Thus,
by the product rule,
(i) q′ = θ′g + θg′ = gδ + θg′ = θg′, and
(ii) q′′ = θ′g′ + θg′′ = g′δ + θg′′ = δ + θg′′.
This yields the claim. To get a rigorous proof, we have to show that (i) and (ii)
are valid in the sense of distributions.

However, this follows from applying integration by parts twice. Note that

12.10 Proof of Proposition 11.21 on page 627. Complete the proof in the general
case where the given function F lies in the Banach space C−
π . Use the methods
of functional analysis.
Hint: Let us sketch the main ideas. We will use results from the author’s text-
books, Zeidler (1995), Vols. 1, 2. The notation is the same as introduced in
Sect. 11.5 on page 625. To begin with, we deﬁne the function space C−
2,π which

Problems
737
contains precisely the π-periodic functions f : R →C which are odd. In addi-
tion, we assume that f is twice continuously diﬀerentiable on the interval [0, π].
Equipped with the norm
||f||2,π := ||f||π + ||f ′||π + ||f ′′||π,
the space C−
2,π becomes a complex Banach space. For ﬁxed ω ≥0, deﬁne
Aωq := q′′ + ω2q,
q ∈C−
2,π.
This is a linear continuous operator
Aω : C−
2,π →C−
π .
(12.93)
To begin with, let ω = 0. For given F ∈C−
π , the equation
A0q = F,
q ∈C−
2,π
(12.94)
is equivalent to the boundary-value problem
q′′ = F,
q(0) = q(π) = 0.
This problem has a unique solution. Consequently, the operator A0 from (12.93)
is a Fredholm operator of index zero. Since the embedding C−
2,π ⊆C−
π is com-
pact, the operator Aω from (12.93) represents a compact perturbation of the
operator A0, and hence it is also a Fredholm operator of index zero (see Zeidler
(1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 5.8).
We are now given ω > 0 with ω ̸= k for all k = 1, 2, . . . Then
Aωq = 0,
q ∈C−
2,π
implies q = 0. Since Aω has index zero, the inverse operator
A−1
ω
: C−
π →C−
2,π
is linear and continuous. Let F ∈C−
π be given. By the Fej´er theorem on page
624, there exists a sequence (Fn) of ﬁnite Fourier series such that
lim
n→∞Fn = F
in C−
π .
Set qn := A−1
ω Fn and q := A−1
ω F. Then
Aωqn = Fn,
qn ∈C−
2,π.
This means that
q′′
n + ω2qn = Fn,
qn(0) = qn(π) = 0
along with q′′ + ω2q = F,
q(0) = q(π) = 0. Since qn is a ﬁnite Fourier series,
the argument used in the proof of Prop. 11.21 on page 627 shows that
qn(t) =
Z π

G(t, τ; ω)Fn(τ)dτ.

If one does not sometimes think the illogical, one will never discover new
ideas in science.
Max Planck (1858–1947)
Mathematics is not a deductive science – that’s a clich´e. When you try
to prove a theorem, you don’t just list the hypotheses, and then start to
reason. What you do is trial-and-error, experimentation, and guess work.
Paul Halmos (born 1916)
“I think, this is so”, says Cicha, “in the ﬁght for new insights, the breaking
brigades are marching in the front row. The vanguard that does not look
to left nor to right, but simply forges ahead – those are the physicists.
And behind them there are following the various canteen men, all kinds
of stretcher bearers, who clear the dead bodies away, or simply put, get
things in order. Well, those are the mathematicians.”
From the criminal novel Death Loves Poetry of the
Czech physicist Jan Klima (born in 1938)1
Whatever the future may bring, it is safe to assert that the theoretical ad-
vances made in the unravelling of the constitution of matter since World
War II (1939–1945) comprise one of the greatest intellectual achievements
of mankind. They were based on the ground secured by Tomonaga, Bethe,
Schwinger, Feynman, and Dyson to quantum ﬁeld theory and renormal-
ization theory in the period from 1946 to 1951.

QED and the Men Who Made it2
The mathematical language of physicists is formal, like a short-hand writ-
ing, but this is extremely useful for getting very quickly the desired results
that are related to the outcome of physical experiments. It is then the hard
task of mathematicians to give rigorous proofs for the heuristic arguments of
physicists. The ﬂow of ideas from physics to mathematics is an indispensable
source of inspiration for mathematicians.
Warning to the reader. In the following chapters, we will summarize
the most important heuristic formulas used in quantum ﬁeld theory.

13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
These heuristic formulas are not to be understood in the sense of
rigorous mathematics.
Nevertheless, this approach should help the reader to understand the lan-
guage of physicists and to ﬁnd his/her own way in the jungle of literature,
which is full of inconsistencies and pseudo-proofs.
In Chaps. 14 and 15, the heuristic formulas are motivated by ap-
plying the formal continuum limit to the rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional
approach from Chap. 7.
The elegance of the mnemonic language of physicists. Mathe-
maticians should note that the language of physicists is optimal from the
mnemonic point of view. Therefore, physicists are not willing to give up their
language despite the mathematical shortcomings.
In each order of perturbation theory, the heuristic formulas used by
physicists can be given a rigorous mathematical meaning.
This will be investigated in the following volumes of this monograph. Un-
fortunately, as a rule, the rigorous mathematical approach is equipped with
technical details which obscure the basic ideas, in contrast to the language
of physicists. Therefore, it is important for mathematicians to know the lan-
guage of physicists as a guide to the rigorous approach. We will use the fol-
lowing two approaches in order to pass from heuristic quantum ﬁeld theory
to rigorous quantum ﬁeld theory in each order of perturbation theory.
(D) Discretization: The idea is to pass from the heuristic continuum formu-
las to rigorous formulas by discretization of space, time, and momentum.
We then supplement the ﬁnite formulas by additional terms called coun-
terterms in order to guarantee the existence of the continuum limit. This
second step is called renormalization.
(G) Generalized functions: We avoid discretization by using tempered dis-
tributions from the very beginning. This is the so-called Epstein–Glaser
approach.
Survey on diﬀerent approaches. Roughly speaking, there exist the
following approaches to quantum ﬁeld theory:
(i) the response approach based on the generating functional for correlation
functions, the magic quantum action reduction formula, and the magic
LSZ reduction formula for the S-matrix (Sects. 14.2.4 and 14.2.5);
(ii) the response approach based on the global quantum action principle via
functional integrals, which implies (i) (Sect. 14.2.7);
(iii) the operator approach based on Dyson’s S-matrix along with creation
and annihilation operators for particles (Chap. 15);
(iv) gauge ﬁelds, functional integrals, Faddeev–Popov ghosts, and BRST
symmetry (Chap. 16);

13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
741
(v) functional integrals and quantum ﬁeld theory at ﬁnite temperature (Sect.
13.8);
(vi) the rigorous Epstein–Glaser approach via the S-matrix as a tempered
operator-valued distribution (Sect. 15.4.4);
(vii) the rigorous global approach of axiomatic and algebraic quantum ﬁeld
theory (Sect. 15.6);
(viii) the Ashtekar program based on the transport of quantum information
along loops and holonomy (loop quantum gravity).3
In (i) through (vi), we get formal power series expansions which can be re-
garded as asymptotic series, by the classical Ritt theorem (Sect. 15.5.2). In
higher-order perturbation theory, the expressions are rather involved from the
analytical point of view. These expressions can be represented graphically by
Feynman diagrams. This helps very much to get insight into the structure of
perturbation theory and its renormalization. In this context,
• Zimmermann’s forest formula and
• Kreimer’s Hopf algebra play a crucial role (see Sect. 15.4.6).
Surprisingly enough, as a rule of thumb, the experience of physicists shows
that the apparently diﬀerent approaches (i) through (vi) above yield the same
numerical results when applied to the measurements of concrete physical
eﬀects. It is the task for the future to understand this equivalence in the
framework of a general mathematical theory. Hints for further reading on
quantum ﬁeld theory can be found on page 907ﬀ.
Historical remarks. Originally, Heisenberg and Pauli started quantum
ﬁeld theory in 1929 by representing quantum ﬁelds as operator-valued func-
tions
ϕ = ϕ(x, t)
depending on the position vector x and time t. Here, the value ϕ(x, t) lies in
a Hilbert space. However, it turned out that this approach is full of contradic-
tions caused, for example, by not knowing the right commutation relations
for interacting quantum ﬁelds from the very beginning.
Therefore, Feynman and Schwinger moved to a pragmatic point of
view and tried to completely avoid the notion of operators in Hilbert
space.
The approaches (i) and (ii) above will be formulated independently of oper-
ator theory.
The idea is to relate the classical principle of critical action to corre-
lation functions which describe the correlations of the quantum ﬁeld
at diﬀerent space points and time points.
3 We will study this in Volume VI on quantum gravitation. We recommend the sur-
vey articles by Ashtekar, Lewandowski (2004) and Giulini, Kiefer, L¨ammerzahl
(2003). See also the ‘Living reviews’ quoted on page 929.

742
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
In Wightman’s axiomatic approach to quantum ﬁeld theory from 1956, quan-
tum ﬁelds are tempered distributions with values in a Hilbert space. In al-
gebraic quantum ﬁeld theory dating back to Segal in 1947, the fundamental
notions are
• observables (elements of an operator algebra), and
• states (positive functionals on the operator algebra).
This notion was generalized by Haag and Kastler in 1967, by passing to so-
called nets of local operator algebras. As the standard textbook, we recom-
mend R. Haag, Local Quantum Physics: Fields, Particles, Algebras, Springer,
New York, 1996. Roughly speaking, a local operator net assigns an operator
algebra to each open subset of the 4-dimensional space-time manifold. This
operator algebra represents physical observables. It is important that this
universal approach can be extended to many-particle systems in statistical
physics and to curved space-time manifolds in order to include quantum grav-
itation. In this setting, it is possible to mathematically introduce two types
of distinguished physical states, namely,
• Kubo–Martin–Schwinger (KMS) states which describe thermodynamic
equilibrium states of many-particle systems, and
• Hadamard states which play a fundamental role in curved space–time man-
ifolds.
For example, the theory of KMS states is equivalent to the Tomita–Takesaki
theory for von Neumann algebras. It is also possible to formulate Einstein’s
principle of general relativity (or the covariance principle) in terms of both
• algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory and
• the Ashtekar program.
In the framework of string theory, quantum ﬁeld theory is a low-energy ap-
proximation of
• vibrating strings and
• higher-dimensional vibrating membranes called D-branes.
This is closely related to the theory of minimal surfaces and Riemannian
geometry in mathematics. We will study this in Volume VI.
13.1 The Method of Moments and Correlation
Functions
The family of moments knows all about a given random phenomenon in
nature.
Folklore

13.1 The Method of Moments and Correlation Functions
743
We expect that a quantum ﬁeld possesses a random structure depending on
space and time with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. The idea of
physicists is to describe the quantum ﬁeld by its local moments which depend
on position and time. For the local moments, physicists use the following
notions synonymously:
• n-point correlation function,
• n-point Green’s function, and
• n-point Feynman propagator.
To be honest, the formal deﬁnitions of these notions diﬀer in the literature.
But, roughly speaking, the physics behind these notions is the same in each
order of perturbation theory. This follows from the nontrivial fact that the
computations based on Feynman diagrams and the corresponding Feynman
rules are the same. Observe the following. We have to carefully distinguish
between
• free quantum ﬁelds, and
• full quantum ﬁelds.
Here, free quantum ﬁelds are free of interactions, whereas full quantum ﬁelds
describe interactions. Naturally enough, the mathematics of free quantum
ﬁelds is much simpler than the mathematics of full quantum ﬁelds. From the
physical point of view, our main interest is to understand full quantum ﬁelds.
As with quantum ﬁelds, we distinguish between
• free correlation functions, and
• full correlation functions.
Correlation functions of free quantum ﬁelds. In terms of functional
integrals, the free n-point correlation function of a free quantum ﬁeld ϕfree is
formally deﬁned by
Cn,free(x1, x2, . . . , xn) :=
 ϕfree(x1)ϕfree(x2) · · · ϕfree(xn)eiSfree[ϕfree]/ℏDϕ

eiSfree[ϕfree]/ℏDϕ
.
Here, Sfree[ϕfree] is the classical action of the free quantum ﬁeld ϕfree. The
symbol
xj := (xj, tj),
j = 1, . . . , n
denotes a space-time point with the position vector xj and time tj, in an
inertial system. The free n-point Green’s function of ϕfree is deﬁned by
Gn,free(x1, x2, . . . , xn) := ⟨0|T {ϕfree(x1)ϕfree(x2) · · · ϕfree(xn)}|0⟩
where the symbol |0⟩denotes the ground state of the free quantum ﬁeld ϕfree.
Therefore, the free n-point Green’s function describes the vacuum expectation
value of time-ordered products of free ﬁeld operators. It turns out that on a
formal level,

744
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
Cn,free = Gn,free,
n = 1, 2, , . . . .
This relates the functional-integral approach to the operator approach in
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Observe that, by deﬁnition, the chronological operator T orders time.
Explicitly, for the quantum ﬁeld ϕ, the deﬁnition of the operator T reads as
T {ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)} := ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)
if
t1 ≥t2.
This has to be replaced by
T {ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)} := ηϕ(x2)ϕ(x1)
if
t2 > t1.
Here, we have to choose the sign η := 1 for bosonic ﬁelds (e.g., photons), and
η := −1 for fermionic ﬁelds (e.g., electrons). For example, the free 2-point
Green’s function (resp. correlation function) reads as
G2,free(x, t; y, s) := ⟨0|T {ϕfree(x, t)ϕfree(y, s)}|0⟩.
This function is also frequently called the Feynman propagator of the free
quantum ﬁeld ϕ. Similarly, we deﬁne the chronological operator for n-factors.
The chronological operator T takes causality into account.
Correlation functions of full quantum ﬁelds. Let us now consider
quantum ﬁelds under interactions. The full n-point correlation function of
the quantum ﬁeld ϕ is formally deﬁned by
Cn(x1, x2, . . . , xn) :=

ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2) · · · ϕ(xn)eiS[ϕ]/ℏDϕ

eiS[ϕ]/ℏDϕ
where S[ϕ] denotes the classical action of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ. In contrast
to the free action Sfree[ϕfree], the action S[ϕ] includes nonlinear terms with
respect to ϕ which describe the interactions. The full n-point Green’s function
of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ is formally deﬁned by
Gn(x1, x2, . . . , xn) := ⟨0int|T {ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2) · · · ϕ(xn)}|0int⟩.
Here, the symbol |0int⟩denotes the ground state of the full quantum ﬁeld
which, as a rule, diﬀers from the ground state |0⟩of the free quantum ﬁeld.
Note that the formulas for Cn and Gn are only mnemonic formulas. On a
formal level, we have
Cn = Gn,
n = 1, 2, , . . ..
Intuitively, the n-point Green’s functions (and hence the correlation func-
tions) describe vacuum ﬂuctuations of the quantum ﬁeld.

13.2 The Power of the S-Matrix
745
The philosophy is that vacuum ﬂuctuations know all about the quan-
tum ﬁeld.
Advantages and disadvantages of diﬀerent approaches. The ad-
vantage of the correlation functions C1, C2, . . . is that they only depend on the
classical action S, but not on operators in Hilbert space. The disadvantage is
that functional integrals are beautiful mnemonic tools, but not well-deﬁned
mathematical objects, as a rule.
The advantage of the Green’s functions G1, G2, . . . is that no ill-deﬁned
functional integrals appear, but operators in Hilbert space. The disadvan-
tage is that the operators ϕ(x) are highly singular objects. Furthermore, the
commutation (resp. anticommutation) relations are not known a priori for
interacting quantum ﬁelds, but they have to be determined. In particular,
the naive assumption that the commutation (resp. anticommutation) rela-
tions for interacting quantum ﬁelds are the same as for free quantum ﬁelds
does not hold.
The idea of local averaging over space and time. It turns out that,
as a rule, the correlation functions Cn are not well-deﬁned as classical local
functions of the space-time variables. Intuitively, however, averages of the
form

Cn(x1, . . . , ; xn)χ1(x1) · · · χn(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn
make sense where χ1, . . . , χn are suitable test functions. More precisely, the
n-point correlation functions are distributions. Note that distributions are
linear mathematical objects and the multiplicative structure of distributions
is subtle, according to Laurent Schwartz. Therefore, the case of nonlinear in-
teracting quantum ﬁelds has to be handled very carefully. In this connection,
the Epstein–Glaser approach works successfully.
The philosophy behind the use of averages is that physical experiments
are based on measurement devices which are only able to measure
mean values.
The discussion of the method of moments in quantum ﬁeld theory will be con-
tinued in Sect. 13.6 in terms of generating functions for moments, generating
functionals, and external physical sources.
13.2 The Power of the S-Matrix
In particle accelerators, physicists measure the following quantities:
• cross sections of scattering processes;
• masses of stable particles;
• lifetimes of unstable particles;
• magnetic moments of elementary particles.

746
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
The task is to theoretically predict the measured values. To this end, physi-
cists use two concepts, namely,
• the S-matrix and
• n-point correlation functions.
Roughly speaking, the two concepts are equivalent. The S-matrix encodes the
transition probabilities of scattering processes. In fact, the S-matrix knows
all about elementary particles.
• The S-matrix enables us to compute the cross sections of scattering pro-
cesses.
• The singularities of the S-matrix refer to the masses of stable particles.
• Analytic continuation of the S-matrix in momentum space tells us the
masses of unstable particles (also called resonances) and their lifetimes.
• The S-matrix allows us to compute the full correlation functions by the
magic Gell-Mann–Low formula. This way, for example, we get so-called
form factors which yield the magnetic moments of elementary particles
(e.g., the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the muon).
13.3 The Relation Between the S-Matrix and the
Correlation Functions
We expect that there exists a close connection between the S-matrix and the
full correlation functions. This is indeed the case. In the 1950s, physicists de-
veloped magic formulas in order to pass from the S-matrix to the correlation
functions and vice versa.
The response approach. This will be studied in Chap. 14. The two
magic formulas read as follows.
(QA) The quantum action reduction formula (14.38): computation of the full
correlation functions by means of the free correlation functions.
(LSZ) The Lehmann–Szymanzik–Zimmermann reduction formula (14.41):
computation of the S-matrix by using the full correlation functions ob-
tained by (QA).
The basic formulas (QA) and (LSZ) can be obtained from the global quan-
tum action principle which is based on Feynman’s magic functional-integral
formula (14.43). This functional integral describes quantum ﬂuctuations by
averaging over all possible classical ﬁelds. The statistical weight depends on
the classical action.
The operator approach. This approach will be studied in Chap. 15; it
will be based on the following two magic formulas.
(D) The Dyson formula (15.12): computation of the S-matrix by means of
free quantum ﬁelds and the interaction terms of the classical action.

(GL) The Gell-Mann–Low formula (15.28): computation of the full correla-
tion functions by using the S-matrix.
Roughly speaking, the response approach (QA), (LSZ) and the operator ap-
proach (D), (GL) are equivalent. This means that they lead to the same
physical results.
Full quantum ﬁelds. The question arises of how to compute full quan-
tum ﬁelds. In fact, this can be done by using Bogoliubov’s formula (15.35)
which allows us to compute the full quantum ﬁeld as a functional derivative
of the S-matrix formulated in the language of tempered distributions. In this
setting, the S-matrix is a primary object, whereas the quantum ﬁeld is a
derived object.
13.4 Perturbation Theory and Feynman Diagrams
The magic formulas from the preceding section allow us to elegantly compute
the S-matrix and the full correlation functions in terms of
• free correlation functions, and
• the wave functions of free particles.
To this end, we use the method of perturbation theory. The higher-order ap-
proximations yield rather complex analytic expressions. Fortunately enough,
these expressions are structured, and they can be represented graphically
by diagrams ﬁrst introduced by Feynman. In elementary particle physics,
physicists use
• Feynman diagrams and Feynman rules.

748
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
The Feynman rules yield analytic expressions for the S-matrix and the cor-
relation functions in a very eﬀective way. Figure 13.1 on page 747 shows
some Feynman diagrams for the Compton scattering where a photon hits an
electron. Observe the following:
• The number of nodes tells us the approximation order of perturbation
theory. This causes the increasing complexity of Feynman diagrams when
passing to higher-order approximations.
• The Feynman diagrams of the S-matrix contain external lines which cor-
respond to incoming and outgoing particles of the scattering process. The
internal lines can be regarded as virtual particles which are related to
quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state.
• The amputated S-matrix diagrams are independent of the incoming and
outgoing particles; these diagrams correspond to the magic LSZ formula
(14.41) which relates the S-matrix to the correlation functions.
13.5 The Trouble with Interacting Quantum Fields
Let us now discuss a crucial diﬃculty which arises for full quantum ﬁelds.
From the mathematical point of view, free quantum ﬁelds are well-understood
mathematical objects; they are tempered distributions with values in a
Hilbert space. In contrast to this, the experience of physicists and mathe-
maticians shows that the notion of a full quantum ﬁeld causes mathematical
trouble. The partial diﬀerential equations for full quantum ﬁelds can be easily
written down, as in the classical case. However, one has to add commutation
(resp. anticommutation) relations for the ﬁeld operators. The following ques-
tion arises:
What are the right commutation (resp. anticommutation) relations
for full quantum ﬁelds?
If one uses the same commutation (resp. anticommutation) relations as for
free ﬁelds, then one gets contradictions. In most physics textbooks, it is as-
sumed that the full quantum ﬁeld is unitarily equivalent to the free quan-
tum ﬁeld. This is used along with Dirac’s interaction picture in order to
get the S-matrix in the framework of perturbation theory. However, this as-
sumption is completely wrong. Unitarily equivalent Hilbert space theories
describe the same quantum physics. Intuitively, however, free quantum ﬁelds
and full quantum ﬁelds correspond to diﬀerent physical situations. In fact,
Haag proved in 1955 that under appropriate assumptions, such a unitary
equivalence along with Dirac’s interaction picture does not exist. This is the
famous Haag theorem.4

Theory, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1990, p. 388ﬀ.

13.6 External Sources and the Generating Functional
749
We have shown in Sect. 7.19.3 that the Dirac interaction picture exists
in ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The point is that this does not remain
true for inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Therefore, we will never use the
inﬁnite-dimensional Dirac interaction picture in this monograph. To overcome
this diﬃculty, one can apply the ﬁnite-dimensional Dirac interaction picture
as an approximation. One then has to study the limit of passing to inﬁnite
dimensions. One expects that this limit does not exist for quantum ﬁelds, but
the limit exists for those quantities that can be measured in physical exper-
iments (e.g., cross sections). We will show later on that this approximation
method works well.
Note that the right commutation (resp. anticommutation) relations for
full quantum ﬁelds are unknown at the very beginning. They have to be
determined at the end of the solution process. In the setting of the Epstein–
Glaser approach, the basic idea is to determine the S-matrix as an operator-
valued tempered distribution S = S(g) by an iterative process, in each order
of perturbation theory. The full quantum ﬁeld Φ = Φ(g) is then obtained from
the S-matrix by using the Bogoliubov formula (15.35) on page 857 based on
functional diﬀerentiation. This approach is rigorous on a perturbative level.
13.6 External Sources and the Generating Functional
Study the response of physical systems under the inﬂuence of external
sources.
Folklore
In the classical theory of probability, one studies generating functions for the
moments. These generating functions know all about the random situation
under consideration (see page 58).
The generating functional. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the classical gen-
erating function is replaced by the generating functional for the correlation
functions given by
Z(J) : = 1 + i

This functional depends on the function J. Following Schwinger, this function
is called an external source.5 It remains to compute the functional Z(J). This
will be done on page 753 by means of the magic Feynman formula (13.7).
This formula is based on a functional integral which depends on the classical
action. Similarly, we introduce the free generating functional,

Volterra’s diﬀerential calculus. Generalizing the classical Taylor ex-
pansion, functionals of the type Z(J) were investigated in mathematics by
Volterra (1860-1950) around 1900. Motivated by classical partial derivatives,
Volterra introduced partial functional derivatives in such a way that
δZ(J)

(13.2)
and

Similarly,
δnZfree(J)
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn)|J=0 := in
ℏn Cn,free(x1, . . . , xn),
n = 2, 3, . . .
The deﬁnition of partial functional derivatives can be found in Sect. 7.20.2
on page 401. Partial functional derivatives are also called local functional
derivatives. The formulas above are well-deﬁned, since we tacitly assume
that the correlation functions are symmetric with respect to the variables
x1, x2, . . .
Cumulants and reduced correlation functions. In order to simplify
computations, physicists introduce the so-called reduced generating func-
tional by setting
Zred(J) := ln Z(J).
In particular, Z(0) = 1 implies Zred(0) = 0. Conversely,
Z(J) = eZred(J).
The so-called reduced (or connected) correlation functions, Cn,red are given
by the following expansion
Zred(J) :=

R4n Cn,red(x1, · · · xn)J(x1) · · · J(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn.
Passing from Z(J) to Zred(J) eliminates redundant quantities and simpliﬁes
computations. In terms of Feynman graphs, connected correlation functions
correspond to connected Feynman graphs. Thus, the passage to connected
correlation functions avoids the use of redundant disconnected Feynman di-
agrams.
The method of connected correlation functions in physics corresponds
to the method of cumulants in mathematics. Classical moments can be ex-
pressed by cumulants (or semi-invariants) and vice versa. This simpliﬁes the

computation of moments. See Shiryaev (1996), Sect. II.12. We also recom-
mend the classic monograph on the problem of moments by Shohat and
Tamarkin (1950). The problem of moments concerns the reconstruction of a
mass (or probability) distribution from its moments. This classical problem
can be solved by using the Hahn–Banach theorem from functional analysis.
This can be found in both Zeidler (1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 1.4 and Lax (2002).
The mean ﬁeld approximation. The local functional derivative

vertex functions correspond to Feynman diagrams which have a minimal
redundance. We will study this in later volumes. We also refer to Greiner
and Reinhardt (1996b), Sect. 12.7.
Correlation functions represent a basic tool for studying physical processes
in both elementary particle physics and solid state physics. There exists a
wealth of physical phenomena which have to be explained. Physicists use
both
• the mean ﬁeld ϕmean and
• the eﬀective quantum action V (ϕmean)
as approximations for describing quantum corrections.
13.7 The Beauty of Functional Integrals
The action knows all about a quantum system via functional integrals.

In modern elementary particle physics, most physicists prefer the use of func-

13.7.1 The Principle of Critical Action
It is quite interesting that many physical phenomena in nature are governed
by the principle of critical action. As the prototype, consider a real ﬁeld
ϕ : R4 →R. We deﬁne the action S by setting
S[ϕ] :=

Ω
L(ϕ(x), ϕx(x), ˙ϕ(x)) d4x.
Here, x = (x, t). The derivative ϕx stands for the tupel (ϕx1, ϕx2, ϕx3) of
partial derivatives, and ˙ϕ denotes the partial time derivative ϕt. Moreover,
the domain of integration is given by the product set
Ω:= C × [t0, t1]
where C is a nonempty bounded open subset of R3 (e.g., a cube), and [t0, t1]
is a ﬁnite time interval. The function L is called the Lagrangian density. The
principle of critical action for the ﬁeld ϕ reads as
S[ϕ] = critical!
(13.3)
We have to add the boundary condition ϕ = ﬁxed on ∂Ω. Each smooth
solution ϕ of the variational problem (13.3) satisﬁes the following Euler–
Lagrange equation

The proof will be given in Problem 14.2 on page 805. This equation gener-
alizes Newton’s classical equation of motion in mechanics: time derivative of
momentum equals force. For example, if we choose the Lagrangian density

(13.6)
This is the so-called ϕ4-model (or the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation).
The nonnegative real number κ is called the coupling constant. If κ = 0,
then we get the linear Klein–Gordon equation. The nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equation is a model for an uncharged spinless particle of mass m0 (e.g., a
meson). The κ-term models the self-interaction of the particle. Introducing

This equation can be obtained in the following way. The energy E of a rela-
tivistic particle with rest mass m0 and momentum vector p is given by the
Einstein relation
E2 = m2
0c4 + c2p2.
Motivated by Schr¨odinger quantization, let us use the replacement
E ⇒iℏ∂
∂t,
p ⇒−iℏ∂.
Hence 2ϕ + m2
0c2
ℏ2 ϕ = 0. This is the linear Klein–Gordon equation.
13.7.2 The Magic Feynman Representation Formula
The fundamental generating functional Z(J) for the full correlation functions
is given by the magic Feynman formula
Z(J) = N

F
eiS[ϕ]/ℏeiJ[ϕ]/ℏDϕ.
(13.7)
This is also called the global quantum action principle. Here, we set
J[ϕ] :=

Ω
J(x)ϕ(x)d4x.
The normalization factor N is uniquely determined by the normalization con-
dition Z(0) = 1. Concerning the functional integral from (13.7), we integrate
over all possible classical ﬁelds ϕ which satisfy the same boundary condition
as in the principle of critical action (13.3). These classical ﬁelds ϕ form the
space F. Observe that the symbol Dϕ stands for a formal measure on the
function space F. Formula (13.7) is one of the most beautiful and most use-
ful formulas in theoretical physics. It relates the classical action of a physical
ﬁeld ϕ to the full generating functional Z(J) which describes the quantum
ﬂuctuations of the corresponding quantized ﬁeld. Therefore, we call formula
(13.7) the global quantum action principle (or the integral quantum action
principle).6
6 In mathematics, measure integrals are denoted by
Z(J) = N
Z
F
eiS[ϕ]/ℏeiJ[ϕ]/ℏdµ[ϕ].

754
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
13.7.3 Perturbation Theory
Let us assume that the Lagrangian density has the form
L = Lfree + κLint
where κ is a suﬃciently small nonnegative number called the coupling con-
stant. Here, Lfree and κLint describe the free ﬁeld and the interaction, respec-
tively. Assume that the function Lint only depends on the ﬁeld function ϕ,
but not on its partial derivatives. In the special case (13.5), the interaction
term κLint(ϕ) is equal to −κϕ4/4. Setting
Sfree[ϕ] :=

Ω
Lfree(ϕ(x), ϕx(x), ˙ϕ(x)) d4x
and Sint :=

ΩLint(ϕ(x)) d4x, we get
S[ϕ] := Sfree[ϕ] + κSint[ϕ].
By (13.7), the free generating functional reads as
Zfree(J) = Nfree

F
eiSfree[ϕ]/ℏeiJ[ϕ]/ℏDϕ.
The normalization factor Nfree is uniquely determined by the normalization
condition Zfree(0) = 1. The key formula reads as
Z(J) = N exp
!
−i
ℏ

Ω
d4x · κLint

Zfree(J).
(13.8)
This formula shows us how to reduce the full generating functional to the
free generating functional. This means that the full correlation functions can
be computed by means of the free correlation functions. The normalization
factor N is uniquely determined by the normalization condition Z(0) = 1.
Observe that formula (13.8) is independent of the use of functional integrals.
13.7.4 Renormalization
As we will show in Volume II on quantum electrodynamics, there are ap-
proximations obtained by perturbation theory which are in good agreement
To simplify notation, physicists use the symbol Dϕ instead of dµ[ϕ]. Mnemon-
ically, the symbol Dϕ resembles the Leibniz notation,
R
f(x)dx, for classical
integrals. It was shown by Cameron (1960) that the Feynman functional integral
does not exist as a measure integral, in the sense of mathematics. For the the-
ory of functional integrals, we recommend Roepstorﬀ(1996), Grosche and Steiner
(1998) (handbook), Johnson and Lapidus (2000), Klauder (2000), Chaichian and
Demichev (2001), Vols. 1, 2.

Fig. 13.2. Critical Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics
with physical experiments. For example, this concerns Compton scattering
(see the Feynman diagram in Fig. 13.1(a) on page 747.) However, there are
also processes which lead to divergent expressions in low-order perturbation
theory. Typical processes of this kind in quantum electrodynamics are pic-
tured in Fig. 13.2. In order to extract values from the divergent expression
which coincide with those values obtained in physical experiments, one has
to use the methods of renormalization theory (see Sect. 15.4).
13.7.5 Transition Amplitudes
Fix the ﬁnite time interval [s, t]. We are given the classical ﬁeld ϕ0 = ϕ0(x)
at the initial time s and the classical ﬁeld ϕ1 = ϕ1(x) at the ﬁnal time t. We
assume that there exists a Hamiltonian operator (energy operator) H to the
quantized version of the classical system with the action S. We are interested
in the transition probability
|⟨ϕ1|e−iH(t−s)/ℏ|ϕ0⟩|2
from the quantum state ϕ0 at time s to the quantum state ϕ1 at time t.
Feynman’s main hypothesis tells us that we have the key formula
⟨ϕ1|e−iH(t−s)/ℏ|ϕ0⟩=

F
eiS[ϕ]/ℏDϕ.
(13.9)
Here, the functional integral sums over all classical ﬁelds ϕ = ϕ(x, τ) which
satisfy the boundary conditions
ϕ(x, s) = ϕ0(x),
ϕ(x, t) = ϕ1(x)
for all
x ∈R3
at time s and t, respectively. The inner product ⟨ϕ1|e−i(t−s)H/ℏϕ0⟩is called
the transition amplitude. It turns out that transition amplitudes play a crucial
role in quantum ﬁeld theory. The importance of transition amplitudes for the
computation of quantum processes was emphasized by Feynman in the 1940s.

13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
13.7.6 The Magic Trace Formula
In statistical physics, the trace of operators plays a crucial role. Let us discuss
the key formulas.
Propagator. For the trace of the operator e−i(t−s)H/ℏ, we will use the
formula
tr e−iH(t−s)/ℏ=

Fperiodic
eiS[ϕ]/ℏDϕ.
(13.10)
Here, the functional integral sums over all classical ﬁelds ϕ which satisfy the
following periodicity condition:
ϕ(x, s) = ϕ(x, t)
for all
x ∈R3.
Formula (13.10) is motivated by applying a formal limit to the rigorous trace
formula (7.87).
Statistical physics. Replacing i/ℏby 1/ℏ, we get
tr e−H/kT =

Fperiodic
eS[ϕ]/ℏDϕ.
(13.11)
Here, the temperature T is equal to ℏ/k(t−s) where k denotes the Boltzmann
constant. In other words, the passage from the propagator to the partition
function corresponds to the replacement
i(t −s)
ℏ
⇒1
kT
(13.12)
which sends imaginary time to inverse temperature. Planck’s quantum of
action, ℏ, and the Boltzmann constant, k, guarantee that the quantities have
the correct physical dimensions.
The fundamental transformation (13.12) is responsible for the close
connection between quantum ﬁeld theory and statistical physics.
Summarizing, the three key formulas (13.9), (13.10), and (13.11) above relate
the action S of the classical ﬁeld ϕ to the Hamiltonian operator H of the
corresponding quantized ﬁeld. Observe that the key formulas do not give us
the Hamiltonian operator H itself, but only the transition probabilities as
an averaging over classical ﬁelds. However, this is very useful for computing
physical eﬀects. A special model will be considered in Sect. 13.8.3.
The reader should observe that in quantum ﬁeld theory, one has to dis-
tinguish between
(i) processes which are independent of temperature (e.g., scattering processes
in particle accelerators) and
(ii) processes which critically depend on the temperature (e.g., processes in
stars or in the early universe).
In case (ii), we speak of quantum ﬁelds at ﬁnite temperature.

13.8 Quantum Field Theory at Finite Temperature
In mathematics and physics, many-particle systems are described by gen-
erating functions. Physicists call them partition functions.
Folklore
What happens when ordinary matter is so greatly compressed that the
electrons form a relativistic degenerate gas, as in a white dwarf? What
happens when the matter is compressed even further so that atomic nuclei
overlap to form superdense nuclear matter, as in a neutron star? What
happens when nuclear matter is heated to such great temperatures that
the nucleons and pions melt into quarks and gluons, as in high-energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions? What happened to the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the uniﬁed theory of the weak and electromagnetic interactions
during the big bang? Questions such as these have been fascinated me for
the past ten years. One reason is that a study of such systems involves sta-
tistical physics, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics,
and cosmology, all of which I ﬁnd interesting.
Joseph Kapusta, 1993
Finite-Temperature Field Theory7
Quantum statistics concerns many-particle systems (e.g., gases, systems of
elementary particles, condensed matter). We want to show that the theory of
such systems is governed by a single function, namely, the partition function
Z. Both
• the generating functional Z(J) (see Sect. 13.7.2) and
• the partition function Z (see Sect. 13.8.3)
can be represented by functional integrals. This underlines the close relation
between quantum ﬁeld theory and statistical physics. In order to emphasize
this relationship, physicists use the same symbol Z.8 Therefore, generating
functionals Z(J) are also called partition functionals. Interesting physical
applications will be considered in the later volumes.
We have seen in Chap. 6 that the notion of partition function also plays
a fundamental role in mathematics, for example, in number theory. Edward
Witten uses partition functions in an ingenious manner in order to get deep
insight into mathematics by using models motivated by physics.
13.8.1 The Partition Function
The general scheme of quantum statistics. Many-particle quantum sys-
tems are described by two operators in a Hilbert space, namely,
• the energy operator H (also called Hamiltonian), and
• the particle number operator N.

8 Mnemonically, the symbol ‘Z’ refers to the German word ‘Zustandssumme’ which
means ‘partition function’.

758
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
In addition, we use the following three real parameters:
• the absolute temperature T ,
• the chemical potential µ, and
• the size (volume) V of the system.
More generally, we want to describe s species of particles (e.g., electrons,
photons, etc.) Therefore, we use s particle number operators
N1, N2, . . . , Ns
along with the chemical potentials µ1, . . . , µs. Here, Nj refers to the jth
species of particles. We start with the statistical operator
ˆϱ := eβ(Ps
j=1 µjNj−H).
(13.13)
Here, β := 1/kT, where k denotes the Boltzmann constant. This yields both
the partition sum
Z := tr ˆϱ
(13.14)
and von Neumann’s density operator ϱ := ˆϱ
Z .
Mean values of observables. The density operator ϱ is related to the
measurements of physical observables. Let A and B be observables (i.e., self-
adjoint operators on the Hilbert space X). Then the mean value of the ob-
servable A measured in an experiment is given by
A := tr(ϱA).
This allows us to introduce the nonnegative mean ﬂuctuation ∆A of the
observable A by setting
(∆A)2 = (A −A)2.
In addition, we introduce the correlation coeﬃcient
γ := (A −A)(B −B)
∆A · ∆B
of the two observables A and B. For a many-particle system related to the
operator-valued function ϕ = ϕ(x, t) of a quantum ﬁeld, we set
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) := tr(ˆϱT {ϕ(x1)ϕ2(x) · · · ϕ(xn)})
with xj := (xj, tj). The chronological operator T refers to time t1, . . . , tn.
This is called the n-point correlation function. Note that physicists use the
terms n-point correlation function, n-point Green’s function and n-point
Feynman propagator synonymously. We deﬁne

• the mean particle number, N j of the jth species,
• the entropy S = −k ln ϱ = −k tr(ϱ ln ϱ), and
• the free energy F := E −TS.
Physical quantities. We want to show that all of the interesting physical
quantities of a many-particle system can be computed if we know its partition
function Z. To this end, we introduce the statistical potential
Γ(T, µ1, . . . , µs, V ) := −kT ln Z(T, µ1, . . . , µs, V ).
The partition function Z, and hence Γ, depends on the variables T (temper-
ature), µ1, . . . , µs (chemical potentials) and V (volume). The corresponding
partial derivatives yield the following physical quantities:
• entropy: S = −ΓT ;
• mean particle numbers: N j = −Γµj, j = 1, . . . , s;
• pressure P = −ΓV ;
• free energy F = Γ + s
j=1 µjN j;
• mean (inner) energy E = F + TS;
• free enthalpy G = F + PV ;
• enthalpy: E + PV.
In the 19th century, these quantities were introduced ﬁrst in phenomeno-
logical thermodynamics. The relations between these quantities and their
physical interpretation are thoroughly discussed in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV,
p. 387.
Finite-dimensional prototype. Let |E1⟩, . . . , |Em⟩be an orthonormal
basis of the complex Hilbert space X. We set

k=1 Ek|Ek⟩;
• particle number operator Nj := m
k=1 njk|Ek⟩of the jth species where
j = 1, . . . , s;
• density operator: ϱ := m

particle of energy Ek. In this state, there are njk particles of the jth species.
The probability for realizing this situation is equal to pk. This will be studied
in greater detail along with physical applications in Volume IV on quantum
mathematics.
13.8.2 The Classical Hamiltonian Approach
As preparation for the magic Feynman formula in Sect. 13.8.3, let us sketch
the passage from the Lagrangian approach to the Hamiltonian approach.9
Special case. Choose the Lagrangian density L from the nonlinear Klein–
Gordon model (13.5). Explicitly,
L(ϕ, ϕx, ˙ϕ) :=
˙ϕ2
2c2 −ϕ2
x
2 −m2
0c2ϕ2
2ℏ2
−κϕ4
4 .
We proceed in the following steps:
(I) Legendre transformation: Deﬁne the generalized momentum density
π := ∂L
∂˙ϕ.
Explicitly, π = ˙ϕ/c2. This allows us to eliminate the time derivative ˙ϕ.
(II) The Hamiltonian density H: Deﬁne
H := π ˙ϕ −L(ϕ, ϕx, ˙ϕ)
9 We will show in Volume II that symplectic geometry plays a crucial role in the
Hamiltonian approach to physics.

13.8 Quantum Field Theory at Finite Temperature
761
where we eliminate ˙ϕ with the help of π. Hence H only depends on ϕ, ϕx,
and π. Explicitly,
H(ϕ, π) = c2π2
2
+ ϕ2
x
2 + m2
0c2ϕ2
2ℏ2
+ κϕ4
4 .
We set
H(t; ϕ, π) :=

C
H(ϕ(x, t), ϕx(x, t), π(x, t)) d3x.
This is the total energy of the ﬁeld in the 3-dimensional open bounded
set C at time t. Thus, H represents the energy density of the ﬁeld. The
energy density is positive, as expected.
(III) The Hamiltonian equations of motion reads as
˙π(x, t) = −δH(t; ϕ, π)
δϕ(x)
,
˙ϕ(x, t) = δH(t; ϕ, π)
δπ(x)
.
Here, we use the local functional derivative at the point x,
δH(t; ϕ, π)
δϕ(x)
:= ∂H(P)
∂ϕ
−∂
∂x
∂H(P)
∂ϕx
,
(13.15)
along with P := (ϕ(x), ϕx(x), π(x)) and x := (x, t). Replacing ϕ by π,
we get the corresponding local functional derivative with respect to π.
Explicitly,
˙π = −m2
0c2
ℏ2
−κϕ3 + ϕxx,
˙ϕ = c2π.
This is equivalent to the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation (13.6).
(iv) The local functional derivative of the Hamiltonian density H is obtained
as follows. Consider an arbitrary smooth test function h = h(x) which has
compact support on the 3-dimensional bounded open set C. Diﬀerentiate
the functional H(t; ϕ + εh, π) with respect to the real parameter ε at the
point ε = 0. Using integration by parts, we get
δH(t; ϕ, π)
δϕ
(h) =

C
δH(t; ϕ, π)
δϕ(x)
· h(x) d3x
where δH(t;ϕ,π)
δϕ(x)
coincides with (13.15).
13.8.3 The Magic Feynman Functional Integral for the Partition
Function
The partition function is given by the following magic formula
Z(T, µ) =

Pperiodic
eS[ϕ,π;T,µ] DϕDπ.
(13.16)

762
13. Basic Strategies in Quantum Field Theory
Here, T is the absolute temperature, µ is the chemical potential, and k is the
Boltzmann constant. Furthermore, we set
S[ϕ, π; T, µ] :=
 1/kT
0
dτ
	
C
π · i
ℏ
∂ϕ
∂τ −H(ϕ, ϕx, π) + µN(ϕ, π) d3x

.
Here, the arguments of the functions ϕ and π are (x, τ). The function N is
the particle number density, that is,
N[ϕ, π] :=

C
N(ϕ(x), π(x))d3x
is the number of particles in the 3-dimensional set C. The functional integral
from (13.16) refers to the function space Pperiodic which consists of all the
functions
ϕ, π : C × R →R
of the argument (x, τ). In addition, we assume that ϕ is periodic with respect
to the variable τ, that is,
ϕ(x, 0) = ϕ
	
x, 1
kT

for all
x ∈C.
Let us motivate the magic Feynman formula (13.16).
(a) The action functional for the classical ﬁeld: In terms of classical ﬁeld
theory, the action functional reads as follows:
S[ϕ, π] =
 t1
t0
dt
	
C
π ∂ϕ
∂t −H(ϕ, π) d3x.

To simplify notation, we set t0 := 0. This yields the magic Feynman
functional integral
Z =

P
eiS[ϕ,π]/ℏDϕDπ
(13.17)
where we sum over all functions ϕ and π which satisfy appropriate side
conditions to be speciﬁed in (d) below.
(b) The passage from time t to temperature T : Motivated by (13.12) on page
756, we use the replacement
it
ℏ⇒1
kT .
To this end, we set t := −iℏτ with τ := 1/kT. This yields
S[ϕ, π] = −iℏ

(c) The passage from ﬁxed particle number to variable particle number: Mo-
tivated by the basic formula (13.13) of statistical physics on page 758,
we use the replacement
energy ⇒energy −µ · particle number.
For the density functions, this means H ⇒H −µN.
(d) The trace formula and the periodicity condition for the ﬁeld ϕ : Accord-
ing to (13.14) on page 758, the partition function corresponds to some
trace. Motivated by the magic trace formula (13.10) on page 756, we use
periodic ﬁelds ϕ. Summarizing this, the desired magic formula (13.16) is
obtained from (13.17).
Applications of the magic partition function formula (13.16) will be consid-
ered in later volumes. We also refer to the textbooks by Feynman (1998)
(14th edition) and Kapusta (1989).
13.8.4 The Thermodynamic Limit
In order to investigate phase transitions, one has to study the so-called ther-
modynamic limit where the volume of the system goes to inﬁnity. Typical
thermodynamic quantities of the system then become singular, which indi-
cates the appearance of a phase transition.

14. The Response Approach
All dynamical information about a quantum system may be extracted by
studying the response of the ground state (vacuum state) of the ﬁeld to
an arbitrary external source J.
Julian Schwinger, 19701
The two magic formulas in quantum ﬁeld theory. It is fascinating that
the huge ﬁeld of quantum ﬁeld theory can be based on two magic formulas,
namely,
(QA) the quantum action reduction formula for full correlation functions,
(LSZ) and the Lehmann–Szymanzik–Zimmermann reduction formula for the
scattering matrix (also called S-matrix).
Since the 1950s, physicists have discovered diﬀerent ways of formulating these
two magic formulas.
In this chapter, our basic strategy is to generalize the rigorous ﬁnite-
dimensional results from Sect. 7.24 to inﬁnite dimensions by carrying
out a formal limit.
In Sect. 7.24 on page 438, we started with discrete functional integrals in
order to derive the two magic formulas (QA) and (LSZ) by means of the
principle of stationary phase.
In this chapter, we will start with the two magic formulas (QA) and
(LSZ) as basic principles.
The situation is similar to Newton’s equation of motion in mechanics and
to Maxwell’s equations in electrodynamics. It is possible to motivate these
equations by using physical and formal mathematical arguments; but one
can also postulate the validity of these equations as the starting point of the
theory. The prototypes of (QA) and (LSZ) can be found in the following two
basic papers:
M. Gell-Mann and F. Low, Bound states in quantum ﬁeld theory. Phys.
Rev. 84 (1951), 350–354.
1 The importance of the source approach to quantum ﬁeld theory is emphasized in
J. Schwinger, Sources, Particles, and Fields, Vols. 1–3, Addison–Wesley, Reading,
Massachusetts, 1970.

766
14. The Response Approach
H. Lehmann, K. Szymanzik, and W. Zimmermann, The formulation of
quantized ﬁeld theories, Nuovo Cimento 1 (1955), 205–225 and 6 (1957),
319–333.
In the ﬁrst paper, Gell-Mann and Low reduced the computation of the full
correlation functions to the free correlation functions. The paper by Lehmann,
Szymanzik, and Zimmermann showed how to reduce Heisenberg’s S-matrix to
the full correlation functions. In fact, this chapter combines several important
contributions made to quantum ﬁeld theory by Feynman, Schwinger, Dyson,
Gell-Mann and Low. We will proceed as follows.
(i) We start with the classical principle of critical action
S[ϕ] = critical!
Here, the action depends on an additional source term which describes the
inﬂuence of an external source on the quantum system. For our approach,
it is crucial that the action of the free ﬁeld is a quadratic form. This allows
us then to apply the methods of Gaussian integrals.
(ii) From (i) we get the classical ﬁeld equation (Euler–Lagrange equation)
Dϕ = −κLint(ϕ) −J
by using the classical calculus of variations.
(iii) Switching oﬀthe interaction by setting κ = 0, we get the so-called
response equation,
Dϕ = −J,
(14.1)
which tells us the response ϕ of the classical ﬁeld ϕ in the presence of an
arbitrary external source J. We replace this by the regularized equation
(D + iεI)ϕ = −J
(14.2)
with the small regularization parameter ε > 0, and we assume that the
inverse operator (D + iεI)−1 exists. Setting Rε := −(D + iεI)−1, the
unique solution of the response equation reads as ϕ = RεJ. In addition,
we assume that the response operator can be represented by the following
integral formula
ϕ(x) =

R4 Rε(x −y)J(y)d4y
for the space-time points x = (x, t). The kernel Rε is called the response
function. Up to some normalization factor, the response function coin-
cides with the Feynman propagator.2
2 In gauge ﬁeld theories, one has to modify the classical action by adding a
Lagrange-multiplier term in order to guarantee the existence of the inverse op-
erator (D + iεI)−1.

14. The Response Approach
767
(iv) Interestingly enough, the response function Rε knows all about the quan-
tized ﬁeld, which diﬀers from the classical ﬁeld by quantum ﬂuctuations.
In fact, from the response function Rε we get the free 2-point correlation
function
C2,free(x, y) := −iℏRε(x −y),
x, y ∈M4.
The magic quantum action reduction formula (QA) then tells us how to
obtain the full n-point correlation function, Cn, of the quantum ﬁeld from
the 2-point free correlation function, C2,free. Finally, the magic reduction
formula (LSZ) tells us how to reduce the S-matrix to the full correlation
functions, Cn, and the free particle functions which are solutions of the
classical free Euler–Lagrange equations.3
(v) From the S-matrix we will obtain the cross sections of scattering pro-
cesses.
(vi) In each order of perturbation theory with respect to powers of the cou-
pling constant κ, the analytic expressions of the magic formulas (QA)
and (LSZ) can be graphically represented by Feynman diagrams.
The physical idea behind this approach is the following one. The physics of a
quantum ﬁeld diﬀers from the physics of the corresponding classical ﬁeld by
additional quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state of the quantum ﬁeld.
Physicists use the following intuitive picture: quantum ﬂuctuations
are caused by virtual particles which jump from the ground state (also
called vacuum state) of the quantum ﬁeld to the real world and back
to the ground state. These particles are called virtual, since they vi-
olate energy-momentum conservation. In the language of Feynman
diagrams, the virtual particles correspond to internal lines.
By the method of moments, we have to compute the moments of the stochas-
tic quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state. To this end, we use perturbed
inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals where the Gaussian kernel depends
on the classical action and the external source. The perturbation of the ideal
Gaussian is governed by the interaction term of the Lagrangian density. This
yields the global quantum action principle. The moments are given by the
n-point correlation functions, Cn.
It is crucial that the magic formulas (QA) and (LSZ) have to be supple-
mented by the following procedures.
(a) Causality and response: The response function Rε refers not to the clas-
sical Euler–Lagrange equation for the motion of the ﬁeld, but to the
regularized Euler–Lagrange equation (14.2). This guarantees the validity
3 In Chap. 15, we will introduce the full n-point Green’s function Gn. It turns out
that Gn coincides with the full n-point correlation function Cn. Therefore, physi-
cists use the terms ‘n-point correlation function’ and ‘n-point Green’s function’
synonymously.

768
14. The Response Approach
of the causality principle and uniquely determines the response function
in Fourier space.
(b) Renormalization: As a rule, the magic formulas (QA) and (LSZ) in-
clude divergent integrals. The fundamental method of renormalization
extracts physical information from these divergent integrals. The idea of
the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) renormalization
method is to regularize the divergent integrals by adding counterterms
to the Lagrangian and by changing the original parameters4 into eﬀec-
tive parameters which can be measured in physical experiments (e.g.,
the eﬀective electron mass, the eﬀective electron charge, and the eﬀective
coupling constant in quantum electrodynamics). Eﬀective parameters are
also called renormalized parameters.
(c) The Faddeev–Popov–De Witt technique in gauge theory: The Standard
Model in particle physics represents a gauge theory. In the quantization
of gauge theories, the presence of the local symmetry group (gauge group)
causes diﬃculties. According to Faddeev and Popov, in order to overcome
the diﬃculties one has to modify the generating functional by taking the
side condition (gauge condition) into account. This leads to additional
ﬁelds called ghosts which will be discussed in Sect. 16.6.
Notation. In the last chapters of this book, we will use the energetic
system of units, that is, we simplify the formulas by setting c = ℏ= ε0 := 1.
Moreover, we will use the following terminology.
(i) Inertial system: We choose a ﬁxed inertial system with right-handed
Cartesian position coordinates x1, x2, x3, and time t. The Cartesian co-
ordinates refer to a ﬁxed right-handed orthonormal system e1, e2, e3. For
the position vector,
x = x1e1 + x2e2 + x3e3,
we brieﬂy write x = xkek. That is, we sum over the upper and lower
Latin index k from 1 to 3. This is a special case of the Einstein summation
convention described below.
(ii) Space-time point: Set x0 := t, and
x = (x0, x1, x2, x3).
Furthermore, introduce the partial derivative ∂µf :=
∂f
∂xµ .
(iii) The Minkowski metric: The ﬁnal goal is to formulate physics in such a
way that it respects Einstein’s principle of special relativity, that is, the
physical processes do not depend on the choice of the inertial system.
To this end, in terms of mathematics, one has to use the methods of the
theory of invariants applied to the Poincar´e group. This will be studied
in Volume III on general gauge theory. At this point, we only emphasize
4 The original parameters are also called bare parameters.

14. The Response Approach
769
that it is important to distinguish between upper and lower indices. For
example, we deﬁne
x1 := −x1,
x2 := −x2,
x3 := −x3,
x0 := x0.
(14.3)
To systemize this, we introduce the Minkowski symbol ηµν for the indices
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3. Explicitly,
η00 := 1,
η11 = η22 = η33 := −1,
along with ηµν = 0 if µ ̸= ν. Moreover, we set ηµν := ηµν for all µ, ν. The
space of all space-time points x coincides with R4. However, in order to
indicate that there is an additional structure induced by the Minkowski
symbol (ηµν), we will denote the space of space-time points x by the
symbol M4. This refers to Minkowski (1864–1909). In 1908 he emphasized
the role of non-classical geometry for describing the structure of the four-
dimensional space-time. Nowadays we use the terms Minkowski space and
Minkowski geometry.
(iv) The Einstein summation convention: We sum over equal upper and lower
Greek indices from 0 to 3. For example,
aµbµ :=
3

µ=0
aµbµ.
In particular, we will use the Minkowski symbol ηµν in order to lift and
to lower indices. For example, xµ := ηµνxν, and
∂µ := ηµν∂ν,
∂µ = ηµν∂ν,
F µν := ηµαηνβFαβ.
Furthermore, if not stated otherwise, we sum over equal upper and lower
Latin indices from 1 to 3. In particular, for the electric ﬁeld E and the
magnetic ﬁeld B, we write E = Ekek = 3
k=1 Ekek and B = Bkek.
(v) The principle of the right index picture: This very convenient principle
tells us that an expression represents an invariant under the transforma-
tions of the Poincar´e group if it has no free indices. For example, set
xy := xµyµ.
Here, we sum over the upper and lower index µ. There is no free index
anymore. Consequently, the inner product xy is an invariant under the
Poincar´e group. Such invariants are independent of the choice of the
inertial system, and hence they possess a physical meaning. As another
example, note that
FµνF µν
has no free index, and hence it is an invariant under the Poincar´e group.
We will show below that this is equal to B2 −E2. More generally, if an

770
14. The Response Approach
equation has the right index picture, that is, the free indices on both
sides of the equation are the same, then this equation is relativistically
invariant, that is, it possesses the right transformation behavior under a
change of inertial systems. For example, the equation
∂µ∂µAν = Jν
QED
(14.4)
has the right index picture because we have the free index ν on both
sides of the equation. Equation (14.4) is one of the equations of motion
in quantum electrodynamics to be considered in Sect. 14.3.
The principle of the right index picture exists for general transfor-
mations including transformations of tensors, spinors and ﬁber
bundles.
This principle is very useful for physics; it will be justiﬁed in Volume III
on gauge theory.
14.1 The Fourier–Minkowski Transform
In quantum ﬁeld theory, it is very useful to pass to momentum space via
Fourier–Minkowski transform.
Folklore
For the convenience of the reader, let us summarize the most important
properties of the Fourier–Minkowski transform in the energetic system of
units.
Deﬁnition. Recall that x = (x, t). Similarly, p = (p, E), and
px := Et −px.
For each function g ∈S(M4), the Fourier–Minkowski transform is deﬁned by
(FMg)(p) :=
α
(2π)2

M4 g(x)eipx d4x,
p ∈M4
(14.5)
along with the inverse transformation5
g(x) =
1
(2π)2α

M4(FMg)(p) e−ipx d4p,
x ∈M4.
The normalization factor α will be ﬁxed in (14.12) below. We also write the
symbol ˆf for the Fourier–Minkowski transform FMf of the function f. This
transformation has the following properties:
5 Recall that the spaces M4 and R4 coincide as linear spaces. Therefore, we have
S(M4) = S(R4) and L2(M4) = L2(R4).

14.1 The Fourier–Minkowski Transform
771
(i) The operator FM : S(M4) →S(M4) is linear, bijective, and sequentially
continuous.
(ii) Parseval equation: For all g, h ∈S(M4),
⟨FMg|FMh⟩L2(M4) = α2⟨g|h⟩L2(M4).
(14.6)
Here, we use the inner product ⟨g|h⟩L2(M4) :=

M4 g(x)†h(x)d4x.
(iii) Duality: For all g, h ∈S(M4),
⟨FMg|h⟩= ⟨g|FMh⟩.
(14.7)
Here, we introduce the duality pairing ⟨g|h⟩:=

M4 g(x)h(x)d4x. In other
words, the operator FM is self-dual with respect to the duality pairing
⟨.|.⟩. For all f, ϕ ∈S(M4), this implies

M4 f(x)ϕ(x)d4x =

M4(FMf)(p)(F−1
M ϕ)(p)d4p.
Equivalently,

M4 f(x)ϕ(x)d4x = 1
α2

M4
ˆf(p)ˆg(−p)d4p.
(14.8)
(iv) Partial derivatives: For all p ∈M4 and all µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
FM(i∂µg)(p) = pµ(FMg)(p).
Similarly, (F−1
M )(i∂µg)(p) = −pµ(F−1
M g)(p).
(v) Convolution: For all g, h ∈S(R4),
FM(g ∗h) = (2π)2
α
(FMg)(FMh).
(14.9)
(vi) Dirac’s delta distribution:
FMδ =
α
(2π)2 .
This means that for all test functions ϕ ∈S(M4), we have δ(ϕ) = ϕ(0)
along with
(FMδ)(ϕ) =

M4
α
(2π)2 ϕ(x) d4x
and
δ(ϕ) =

M4
α
(2π)2 (F−1
M ϕ)(p) d4p.
This is a special case of the general deﬁnition (14.10) below.

772
14. The Response Approach
Let us study the simple relation between the Euclidean Fourier transform, F,
and the Fourier–Minkowski transform, FM. By Sect. 10.3.3, the Euclidean
Fourier transform looks like
(Fg)(p) =
1
(2π)2

M4 g(x) e−iEte−ipxd4x.
Deﬁne the time reﬂection operator operator R(x, t) := (x, −t). Since
(FRg)(p) =
1
(2π)2

M4 g(x, −t)e−iEte−ipxd4x
=
1
(2π)2

M4 g(x, t)eiEte−ipxd4x,
we obtain
FMg = αFRg,
g ∈S(R4).
Therefore, the statements (i)-(vi) above are immediate consequences of the
properties of the Euclidean Fourier transform, F.
The Fourier–Minkowski transform, FMT, of a tempered distribution T ∈
S′(R4) is deﬁned by
(FMT )(ϕ) := T (FMϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R4).
(14.10)
As an example, ﬁx a continuous rational function ˆf : M4 →C. Deﬁne
T (ϕ) :=

M4
ˆf(p)(F−1
M ϕ)(p) d4p
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). Equivalently,
T (ϕ) := 1
α2

M4
ˆf(p) ˆϕ(−p) d4p.
(14.11)
Then, T is a tempered distribution, T ∈S′(R4), and the Fourier–Minkowski
transform of T corresponds to the function ˆf. Explicitly,
(FMT )(ϕ) = T (FMϕ) =

R4
ˆf(p)ϕ(p)d4p,
for all
ϕ ∈S(R4).
Convention. In this monograph, the normalization factor α of the
Fourier–Minkowski transform (14.5) is chosen as
α := 1.
(14.12)
By (i) above, this convention guarantees a simple form of the Parseval equa-
tion. This implies that the operator FM can be uniquely continued to a
unitary operator

14.2 The ϕ4-Model
773
FM : L2(M4) →L2(M4)
on the Hilbert space L2(M4). Let us note that physicists frequently use the
convention α = (2π)2. In this case, the convolution rule becomes simple, but
the unitarity of the Fourier transform is destroyed. In quantum theory, uni-
tary operators preserve the physics. In particular, probabilities, mean values,
and mean ﬂuctuations are preserved. This underlines the importance of uni-
tary operators in quantum theory. The disadvantage of our convention is that
the Feynman propagators get additional factors in momentum space.
14.2 The ϕ4-Model
We are going to study the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation
2ϕ + m2
0ϕ + 4κϕ3 = J
(14.13)
on an inertial system. Explicitly, 2ϕ := ϕtt + ∆ϕ = ϕtt −3
j=1 ϕxjxj. We
are looking for a function ϕ : M4 →R. This is a model for an uncharged
meson with spin zero and rest mass m0 > 0. The constant κ ≥0 is called the
coupling constant of the self-interaction of the particle. The given smooth
function J : R4 →R describes an external source. Let κ = 0. For a given
momentum vector p, deﬁne the energy
Ep :=

p2 + m2
0.
Then the function
up(x, t) := const · ei(px−Ept)
(14.14)
is a solution of equation (14.13) with κ = 0. This function describes a free
meson of rest mass m0, momentum vector p, and energy Ep. In particular,
if p = 0, then E0 = m0.
Now choose κ = 0, and let µ > 0. The damped oscillation
ϕ(t) = const · e−i(E0−iµ)t = const · e−iE0te−µt,
t ∈R
is a solution of the equation
2ϕ + (m0 −iµ)2ϕ = 0.
Setting ε := 2µm0 and assuming that ε is small, then we get the approxima-
tive equation
2ϕ + m2
0ϕ −iεϕ = 0.
This argument motivates the negative sign of the regularizing term −iεϕ.

14. The Response Approach
14.2.1 The Classical Principle of Critical Action
Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of R4. Choose ε > 0. The action
functional of the meson reads as
S[ϕ, J] :=

Ω
L(ϕ, ∂ϕ, J) d4x
with the Lagrangian density
L(ϕ, ∂ϕ, J) := 1
2ϕ(D + iε)ϕ + κLint(ϕ) + ϕJ.
Here, we set D := −2 −m2
0, and Lint(ϕ) := −ϕ4. The variational problem
S[ϕ, J] = critical!
(14.15)
with the boundary condition ϕ = 0 on ∂Ωis called the principle of critical
action for the meson. By Theorem 7.42 on page 460, each smooth solution of
(14.15) satisﬁes the following regularized meson equation
2ϕ + m2
0ϕ −iεϕ + 4κϕ3 = J.
(14.16)
Integration by parts yields

14.2.2 The Response Function and the Feynman Propagator
In physics, use the right approximations and the right limits.
The golden rule
Switching oﬀthe interaction by setting κ = 0, we get the so-called response
equation
2ϕ + m2
0ϕ −iεϕ = J.
(14.17)
It is our goal to study this equation in rigorous terms by using the theory of
tempered distributions and the Fourier–Minkowski transform. To motivate
this, let us ﬁrst apply formal arguments.
Formal response kernel function. We want to use the formal Fourier–
Minkowski transform in order to solve equation (14.17). We will show in a
formal manner that the solution of (14.17) can be written as
ϕ(x) =

M4 Rε(x −y)J(y)d4y,
x ∈M4

(14.19)
This function is also called the response function for mesons. The formal
proof goes like this. We will use the Fourier–Minkowski transform from Sect.
14.1. Deﬁne ˆϕ := FMϕ, ˆJ := FMJ, and ˆRε := FMRε Since
FM(−∂µ∂µϕ) = pµpµ ˆϕ(p) = p2 ˆϕ(p),
it follows from the response equation (14.17) that
(−p2 + m2
0 −iε) ˆϕ(p) = ˆJ(p).
Hence
ˆϕ(p) = −
ˆJ(p)
p2 −m2
0 + iε.
Applying the convolution formula (14.9) to (14.18), we obtain
ˆϕ(p) = (2π)2 ˆRε(p) ˆJ(p).
Therefore,
ˆRε(p) = −
1
(2π)2(p2 −m2
0 + iε).
(14.20)
This implies (14.19). Choosing J(x) := δ4(x), we get formally that
(2 + m2
0 −iε)Rε(x) = δ4(x).
(14.21)
The Feynman propagator and the free 2-point correlation func-
tion. Set
GF,m0,ε(x) := −iRε(x)
along with
C2,free,ε(x, y) := GF,m0,ε(x −y),
x, y ∈M4.
The function GF,m0,ε is called the Feynman propagator of the regularized
Klein–Gordon equation (or the meson propagator).6 Note that the deﬁnition
of the free 2-point correlation function C2,free,ε is motivated by the discrete
ϕ4-model on page 464. By (14.19),

man propagator in the literature which diﬀer by the factor i.

The Fourier–Minkowski transform of GF,m0,ε is given by
ˆGF,m0,ε(p) = −i ˆ
Rε(p) =
i
(2π)2(p2 −m2
0 + iε).
(14.23)
It follows formally from the duality relation (14.8) that

M4
i ˆϕ(−p)

for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4).
Warning to the reader. Observe that formulas (14.19), (14.22) look
very elegant, but they are meaningless, since the integrals do not exist in the
classical sense. In fact, the integrands decrease too slowly at inﬁnity.
In contrast to this bad behavior in position space, both Rε and GF,m0,ε
are well-deﬁned objects in momentum space, by (14.20).
This fact can be used in order to deﬁne Rε and GF,m0,ε as well-deﬁned tem-
pered distributions on position space. In particular, we will show that for-
mulas (14.19), (14.22) are valid in the theory of tempered distributions. In
order to ﬁnd the rigorous approach, we will use formulas (14.19), (14.22) as
mnemonic tools.
The rigorous response operator. Setting D := −2−m2
0, the response
equation (14.17) reads as
(D + iε)ϕ = −J.
If ϕ ∈S(R4), then (D + iεI)ϕ ∈S(R4).Therefore the linear operator
D + iεI : S(R4) →S(R4)
is well-deﬁned.
Proposition 14.1 The operator D + iεI is invertible.
Proof. We will use the Fourier–Minkowski transform along with the following

This corresponds to the operator −(D + iεI) in momentum space.

form, we deﬁne
Rε := F−1
M ˆRεFM.
Obviously, (D + iεI) = −R−1

The rigorous response distribution. We now want to show that the
response kernel function x →Rε(x) and hence the Feynman propagator
x →GF,m0,ε(x)
exist as tempered distributions, and the response integral relation (14.18) is
to be understood in the sense of the convolution of distributions. Motivated
by (14.24), we deﬁne
GF,m0,ε(ϕ) :=

M4
i ˆϕ(−p)
(2π)2(p2 −m2
0 + iε) d4p
(14.26)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). This is a tempered distribution. In addition,
we deﬁne the tempered response distribution by setting
Rε := iGF,m0.
According to (14.11), taking α = 1, the Fourier-Minkowski transforms of the
tempered distributions GF,m0,ε and Rε are given by (14.23).
Theorem 14.2 (i) The tempered distribution Rε is a fundamental solution
of the special response equation,
(2 + m2
0 −iε)Rε = δ.
(ii) For each source function J ∈D(R4), the distribution
ϕ := Rε ∗J

for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). This is the claim.
Ad (ii). This is a special case of Theorem 11.27 on page 645.

The rigorous Feynman propagator distribution. The distribution
GF,m0,ε depends on the regularizing parameter ε > 0. In order to obtain a
propagator distribution which is independent of ε, let us study the limit
GF,m0(ϕ) := lim
ε→+0 GF,m0,ε(ϕ)
(14.28)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). This is the limit in the space S′(R4) of
tempered distributions. The idea is to use Schwinger’s integration trick

The tempered distribution GF,m0 is called the Feynman propagator of the
Klein–Gordon equation (or the Feynman propagator for mesons). Note that
we deﬁne the square root by
√

√
l if l > 0. Moreover, according to
Sect. 11.2.4 on page 595, we use the following convention

GF,m0(ϕ) =

M4 GF,m0(x)ϕ(x)d4x

GF,m0(x) := δ(x2)
4πi + iA(x).
This shows that in the position space, the main singularities of the distribu-
tion GF are concentrated on the light cone given by the equation t2 −x2 = 0.
The Bessel and Neumann functions possess the following behavior near the

Finally, let us introduce some notation which is frequently used. For each
tempered distribution, there exists the Fourier–Minkowski transform. Moti-
vated by the investigations above, the Fourier–Minkowski transform of the
tempered distribution GF,m0 is denoted by

Furthermore, using the equality Rε = iGF,m0 along with Theorem 14.2, we

(14.31)
Singularities of the free 2-point correlation function. Motivated
by the limit ε →+0, we deﬁne the free 2-point correlation function of the
ϕ4-model by setting
C2,free(x, y) := GF,m0(x −y),
x, y ∈M4.
If (x −y)2 = (t −τ)2 −(x −y)2 is small, then there arise singularities given
by (14.29). Explicitly,

This is true for small values of (x −y)2 up to terms of higher order with
respect to (x −y)2. In other words, consider the quantum ﬁeld ϕ at the
position x at time t and at the position y at time τ. Then the correlation of
the quantum ﬁeld between these two events is very large if (t−τ)2 −(x−y)2
is very small. In the limit case where (t −τ)2 −(x −y)2 = 0, the two events
can be connected by a light signal.
The singularities of the correlation function C2,free are related to
causality.
The vertex distribution. We deﬁne the free 2-point vertex distribution
by
V2,free(ϕ) :=

M4(p2 −m2
0) ˆϕ(−p) d4p

14.2 The ϕ4-Model

for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). Let us motivate this deﬁnition by using a
formal argument. Recall ﬁrst the response equation
(2 + m2
0 −iε)ϕ = J
along with its formal solution
ϕ(x) =

M4 Rε(x −y)J(y)d4y,
x ∈M4.
(14.32)
Using the Fourier–Minkowski transform,
ˆϕ(p) = −
ˆJ(p)
(2π)2(p2 −m2
0 + iε).
Motivated by (7.157) on page 474, we introduce the vertex function V2,free
by writing
J(x) = −

M4 V2,free(x −y)ϕ(y)d4y,
x ∈M4.
(14.33)
Up to sign, this is the inverse transformation to (14.32). Using the Fourier–
Minkowski transform,
ˆJ(p) = −(2π)2 ˆV2,free(p) ˆϕ(p).
Hence ˆV2,free(p) = p2−m2
0, after letting ε →+0. We now deﬁne the tempered
distribution V2,free in such a way that its Fourier–Minkowski transform cor-
responds to ˆV2,free. This is the deﬁnition given above, by (14.11) with α = 1.
The Feynman propagator distribution for massless particles. The
deﬁnition of GF,m0 also makes sense if we set m0 = 0 (vanishing mass). Then,
all the formulas above remain valid by setting
m0 = 0,
m2
0 ln m0 := 0.
Instead of GF,m0=0, we brieﬂy write GF . In particular,

The normalization constant N has to be chosen in such a way that we get

functional derivatives
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) := 1
in
δnZ(J)
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn)| J=0.

spect to the variables x1, . . . , xn. This means that the quantum action func-
tional Z = Z(J) represents the generating functional for the family of full
correlation functions C1, C2, . . . . The operator

Switching oﬀthe interaction by setting κ = 0, we get Z(J) = Zfree(J). This
way we obtain the free correlation functions by
Cn,free(x1, . . . , xn) := 1

δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn)| J=0.
Formula (14.38) allows us to reduce the computation of the full correlation
functions C1, C2, . . . to the free correlation functions C1,free, C2,free, . . . In par-
ticular, we get Cn ≡0 for n = 1, 3, 5 . . .
The quantum action axiom. Formula (14.39) is called the magic quan-
tum action reduction formula for the correlation functions of the ϕ4-model.
In our approach above, we use this formula in order to deﬁne the correlation
functions. From the physical point of view, we postulate the validity of this

magic formula as an axiom called the quantum action axiom (or the QA
axiom) of the ϕ4-model.
Motivation. In Sect. 7.24.6 on page 448, we studied the discrete ϕ4-
model in rigorous terms. The formal passage to inﬁnite dimensions yields the
formulas for Z(ϕ, J) and Cn above.
Warning to the reader. Let ε > 0, and let Ωbe a ﬁxed nonempty

This is a convergent integral. More general, we replace all of the integrals

M4 . . . by

Ω. . . This implies that the magic formula (14.39) is well-deﬁned
as a formal power series expansion with respect to the coupling constant κ.
This means that, in each order of perturbation theory with respect to
the coupling κ, we get well-deﬁned correlation functions.
However, these functions depend on the regularization parameter ε and the
cut-oﬀset Ω.
It remains to study the two limits ε →+0 and Ω→R4.
It turns out that this limit leads to divergent expressions. Therefore, physi-
cists invented the method of renormalization. The idea is
• to add counterterms to the Lagrangian density κLint and
• to replace the bare mass m0 by an renormalized (or eﬀective) mass mren.
The goal is to get convergent expressions in each order of perturbation theory,
as ε →+0 and Ω→R4. We refer to Sects. 15.3ﬀon page 847ﬀ.
The experience of physicists shows that one only needs the quantum
action axiom and the LSZ axiom below, combined with the procedure
of renormalization, in order to successfully compute a large number
of physical processes for elementary particles such that the computed
values coincide with the values measured in experiments.
Applications to the computation of concrete physical eﬀects will be considered
in Volume II and the later volumes.

14.2.5 The Magic LSZ Reduction Formula for the S-Matrix
Scattering functions. Parallel to the generating functional Z(J) for the
correlation functions, let us deﬁne the so-called scattering functional
S(ϕ) := Z(0, ϕ)
Z(0, 0)
(14.40)
by using the extended quantum action functional Z = Z(J, ϕ) from Sect.
14.2.3. The scattering functional is normalized by S(0) = 1. Furthermore, for
n = 1, 2, . . ., let us deﬁne the scattering functions by setting
Sn(x1, . . . , xn) :=
δnS(ϕ)
δϕ(x1) · · · δϕ(xn)| ϕ=0.
The scattering functions Sn(x1, . . . , xn) are symmetric with respect to the
variables x1, . . . , xn. Equivalently, we get
S(ϕ) := 1 +


n=1

n!

M4n Sn(x1, . . . , xn)ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn.
This means that the scattering functional S is the generating functional for
the family of scattering functions S1, S2, . . . .
The LSZ axiom. The magic LSZ reduction formula for the ϕ4-model
allows us to compute the normalized scattering functions by means of the full
correlation functions. Explicitly, for n = 1, 2, . . . ,
Sn(x1, . . . , xn) = 1

Note that the wave operator 2xk acts on the variable xk of the full correlation
function Cn.
Motivation. The formula (14.41) is motivated by generalizing Theorem
7.39 on page 450 in a formal manner. We postulate the validity of (14.41) as
an axiom called the LSZ axiom.
S-matrix elements. Let us now brieﬂy discuss the physical meaning of
the scattering functions. By (14.14), the function
up(x, t) := ei(px−Ept)
√
V
is a solution of the free Klein–Gordon equation (2 + m2
0)ϕ = 0. Here, we set

786

Ep :=

0 + p2.
The normalization factor V > 0 is chosen in such a way that

C
|up(x, t))|2 d3x =

C
d3x = 1
where C is an arbitrary bounded open subset of R3. In terms of physics, the
function up describes a homogenous stream of free mesons of particle number
density 1/V. In other words, there is precisely one particle in the box C of
volume V. Each particle has the momentum vector p and the energy Ep.
Now consider a scattering process in the box C with
• n incoming particle streams of free mesons at remote past, t = −∞, de-
scribed by the functions
up1, . . . , upn
of momentum vectors p1, . . . , pn, respectively.
• After scattering, there appear n outgoing particle streams of free mesons
at remote future, t = +∞, described by the functions
upn+1, . . . , up2n
of momentum vectors pn+1, . . . , p2n, respectively.
We deﬁne

R2n S2n(x1, . . . , x2n)

upk(xk)

d4xk.
This is called the S-matrix element of the scattering process. The real number
|Sp1,...p2n|2
is the transition probability of the scattering process. This transition prob-
ability can be used in order to compute the cross section of the scattering
process. This is precisely the quantity which can be measured in scattering
experiments. Many applications to concrete physical processes will be con-
sidered in the following volumes.
Renormalization. The LSZ quantum action axiom (14.41) tells us how
to reduce the scattering functions to the correlation functions. By Sect. 14.2.4,
we have to pass to the renormalized correlation functions. Therefore, physi-
cists replace the correlation functions in the magic formula (14.41) by the
renormalized correlation functions.
This way, physicists get the renormalized scattering functions, and
hence the renormalized S-matrix elements.

Formally, this yields

0 −iε)
δZ
δJ(x) = iJ(x)Z(J) + 4κi δ3Z(J)
δJ(x)3 .
These two equations are motivated by Theorem 7.40 on page 452.
14.2.7 The Mnemonic Functional Integral
The global quantum action principle. The formula
Z(J) = N

S(R4)
eiS[ϕ,J] Dϕ
(14.43)
is called the global quantum action principle. The normalization factor N
is uniquely determined by the normalization condition Z(0) = 1. Here, we
integrate over all possible classical ﬁelds ϕ which lie in the function space
S(R4) of rapidly decreasing smooth functions. The action functional is given
by (14.15), that is,
S[ϕ, J] :=

M4
1
2ϕ(−2 −m2
0 + iε)ϕ −κϕ4 + ϕJ d4x.
Explicitly computing the normalization factor, the global quantum action
principle reads as
Z(J) =

S(R4) eiS[ϕ,J] Dϕ

S(R4) eiS[ϕ,0] Dϕ .
(14.44)
Let n = 1, 2, . . .. For the correlation functions,
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) :=
δnZ(J)
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn)| J=0,
we get
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) =

S(R4) ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn)eiS[ϕ,0] Dϕ

S(R4) eiS[ϕ,0] Dϕ
.
These integrals are to be understood as formal limits of ﬁnite-dimensional
integrals where the dimension of the integrals goes to inﬁnity. Symbolically,

Formal motivation of the magic formulas. In rigorous terms, we have
shown in Sect. 7.25 on page 459 that ﬁnite-dimensional functional integrals
can be used in order to justify both
• the magic quantum action reduction formula and
• the magic LSZ reduction formula.
In the case of the present continuum ϕ4-model, the same arguments can
be applied formally to (14.44) in order to get the magic formulas (14.38)
and (14.41) from Sects. 14.2.4 and 14.2.5, respectively. Observe that this
represents only a formal approach, since the inﬁnite-dimensional functional
integral (14.44) is not a well-deﬁned mathematical object.
14.2.8 Bose–Einstein Condensation of Dilute Gases
The ϕ4-model as a toy model in particle physics. From the modern
point of view of elementary particle physics, the ϕ4-model is only a toy model.
It describes the interactions of elementary particles in the wrong way. It was
discovered by physicists in the 1960s and in the early 1970s that
The Standard Model in particle physics has to be based on the idea
of gauge ﬁeld theory.
Here, in contrast to the ϕ4-model, the interactions between elementary par-
ticles are not described by self-interactions of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ itself, but
by additional gauge ﬁelds which correspond to particles called gauge bosons
(photons, vector bosons W +, W −, Z0, and eight gluons).
• The prototype of the Standard Model is quantum electrodynamics. In Sect.
14.3, we will sketch the basic ideas of quantum electrodynamics. In terms
of gauge ﬁeld theory, quantum electrodynamics refers to the commutative
gauge group U(1). A detailed study of quantum electrodynamics will be
carried out in Volume II.
• The Standard Model in particle physics refers to the product gauge group
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3). This has to be supplemented by the Higgs mecha-
nism which equips the vector bosons W +, W −, Z0 with large masses com-
pared with the proton mass. The point is that the gauge groups SU(2)
and SU(3) are not commutative, in contrast to U(1). The prototype of the
Standard Model in the form of a SU(N)-gauge ﬁeld theory will be stud-
ied in Sect. 16.2 on page 878. In particular, in the case where N = 3, we
get quantum chromodynamics which describes strong interactions based
on quarks and gluons. A detailed study of the Standard Model in particle
physics can be found in Volume III (gauge ﬁeld theory) and Volume V
(physics of the Standard Model).

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
789
Many physicists believe that the ϕ4-model in 4-dimensional space-time M4
describes only a trivial free quantum ﬁeld after renormalization. This means
that the inﬂuence of the interaction term κLint vanishes after renormaliza-
tion. In terms of physics, quantum ﬂuctuations destroy the interaction. Rec-
ommendations for further reading can be found on page 871 (triviality of
the ϕ4-model). It is thinkable that a variant of the ϕ4-model on a modiﬁed
4-dimensional space-time (in the setting of noncommutative geometry) cor-
responds to a nontrivial quantum ﬁeld. This is the subject of recent research.
The ϕ4-model as an eﬀective theory for Bose–Einstein conden-
sation. It was conjectured by Gross and Pitaevskii that the ϕ4-model can
be used in order to describe Bose–Einstein condensation of dilute gases, in
the sense of an eﬀective potential. This conjecture was rigorously proven in
the fundamental paper by
E. Lieb and R. Seiringer, Proof of Bose–Einstein condensation for dilute
trapped gases, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002), No. 170409.

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics studies the interactions between electrons, their
antiparticles (positrons), and photons (gauge bosons). Quantum electrody-
namics was created by Heisenberg and Pauli in 1929.7 The ﬁnal theory was es-
tablished by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga in the 1940s and completed
by Dyson in 1949.8 At this point, let us only sketch a few basic ideas. For
a detailed study of concrete physical processes between electrons, positrons
and photons, we refer to Volume II.

γµγν + γνγµ = 2ηµνI,
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
The symbol ηµν is deﬁned on page 769.
(ii) The four-potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by
A(x) = (A0(x), A1(x), A2(x), A3(x)).
Each component is a smooth real-valued function Aµ : M4 →R.
(iii) The electron ﬁeld ψ has the form of a column matrix
ψ(x) :=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
ψ1(x)
ψ2(x)
ψ3(x)
ψ4(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠.
Here, each component is a smooth complex-valued function ψk : M4 →C.
Furthermore, the adjoint matrix reads as
ψ(x)† = (ψ1(x)†, ψ2(x)†, ψ3(x)†, ψ4(x)†).
Following Dirac,9 we deﬁne ψ(x) := ψ(x)†γ0.
9 In mathematics, one frequently uses the symbol z for the conjugate complex
number to the complex number z. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the symbol ψ is ﬁxed
by the Dirac convention which is standard in the literature. Therefore, we use
the symbol z† for the conjugate complex of z.

14.3.1 The Equations of Motion
In quantum electrodynamics, the classical ﬁeld equations with respect to a
ﬁxed inertial system read as follows.
(E1) The Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fαβ : For
all α, β, γ = 0, 1, 2, 3, we have the Bianchi identity
∂αFβγ + ∂βFγα + ∂γFαβ = 0.
(14.47)
Moreover, for all β = 0, 1, 2, 3, the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor is related
to the electric current generated by the electron ﬁeld according to
∂αF αβ = Jβ
QED.
(14.48)
Explicitly, the electric 4-current density vector is given by
Jβ
QED(x) := −eψ(x)γβψ(x).
Here, −e is the negative electric charge of the electron, and me denotes
the rest mass of the electron.
(E2) Dirac equation:
iγα∂αψ −meψ = −eAαγαψ.
(14.49)
Here, the four-potential Aα, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, is related to the electromag-
netic ﬁeld tensor by the equation
Fαβ = ∂αAβ −∂βAα,
α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3.
We assume that the equations (i) and (ii) above are valid on M4. If we
introduce the covariant derivative
∇α := ∂α −ieAα,
and the Feynman dagger symbol ̸∇:= γα∇α, then the Dirac equation (E2)
can be elegantly written as
(i̸∇−me)ψ = 0.
The language of vector calculus. For the electric ﬁeld vector E and
the magnetic ﬁeld vector B, set
E := Ekek,
B := Bkek.
In addition, let U := A0, A := Akek, as well as

792
14. The Response Approach
ϱ := J0
QED,
JQED := Jk
QEDek.
Here, ϱ is the electric charge density, and JQED is the electric current density
vector. The equation Fαβ = ∂αAβ −∂βAα corresponds to10
B := curl A,
E := −grad U −˙A
along with
F01 = −E1 = E1,
F12 = B3 = −B3.
(14.50)
The remaining expressions are obtained by the cyclic permutation 1 →2 →
3 →1. The Maxwell equations (14.47) and (14.48) read as
div E = ϱ,
div B = 0
curl E = −˙B,
curl B = JQED + ˙E.
In addition, this implies the continuity equation ˙ϱ + div JQED = 0.
The importance of quantum ﬂuctuations. The reader should observe
that
The classical equations of motion in quantum electrodynamics do not
know all about the quantum system. It is crucial to include additional
quantum ﬂuctuations.
This is the highly nontrivial process of quantizing the classical theory. This
will be studied below. The mathematical diﬃculties of quantum ﬁeld theory
refer precisely to the quantization of the Standard Model in particle physics.
14.3.2 The Principle of Critical Action
Our goal is to obtain the equations of motion in quantum electrodynamics
from a variational principle. Let Ωbe a nonempty bounded open subset of
the 4-dimensional space-time M4 (e.g., a 4-dimensional cube). Set
S[A, ψ] :=

Ω
L d4x
along with the Lagrangian density
L = −1
4FαβF αβ + ψ(i∇αγα −me)ψ.
This can be written as
L = −1
4FαβF αβ + ψ(i∂αγα −me)ψ + eLint.
10 The dot denotes the partial derivative with respect to time t.

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
793
The crucial term
eLint := −Jα
QEDAα
(14.51)
describes the interaction between the electromagnetic ﬁeld A and the electron
ﬁeld ψ. The principle of critical action in quantum electrodynamics reads as
follows:
S[A, ψ] = critical!
(14.52)
along with the boundary condition A = ﬁxed on ∂Ωand ψ = ﬁxed on ∂Ω.
The proof of the following theorem will be given in Problem 14.12.
Theorem 14.4 Each smooth solution of (14.52) satisﬁes the equations of
motion (E1), (E2) in quantum electrodynamics given above.
Relativistic invariance. According to Einstein’s principle of special rel-
ativity, quantum electrodynamics has to be independent of the choice of the
inertial system. This is indeed the case for the equations of motion (E1), (E2)
from Sect. 14.3.1. More precisely, for a change of inertial systems, note the
following:
• in 1905 Einstein discovered the correct transformation law for space-time
coordinates and the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fαβ;
• in 1928 Dirac discovered the correct transformation law for the electron
ﬁeld spinor ψ.
The transformation law for space-time coordinates is given by the Poincar´e
group, whereas the transformations laws for Fαβ and ψ refer to represen-
tations of the Poincar´e group. This will be studied in Volume III on gauge
theory.
Discrete symmetries. The equations of motion (E1), (E2) are invariant
under space reﬂection, time reﬂection, and charge conjugation. This will be
studied in Volume III in connection with the Standard Model in particle
physics.
Gauge symmetry. Finally, note that the equations of motion (E1), (E2)
are invariant under the gauge transformation
ψg(x) = eiθ(x)ψ(x),
Ag
α(x) := Aα(x) + 1
e ∂αθ(x)
for all space-time points x ∈M4, and all α = 0, 1, 2, 3. Here, the phase
function
θ : M4 →R
is assumed to be smooth. In fact, the covariant derivative ∇αψ transforms in
the same way as the electron ﬁeld ψ. Explicitly,

794
14. The Response Approach
∇g
αψg(x) = eiθ(x)∇αψ(x).
(14.53)
This follows from the product rule ∂αψg = ieiθ∂αθ · ψ + eiθ∂αψ, and hence
∇g
αψg = (∂α −ieAg)ψg = eiθ(∂α −ieAα)ψ.
In terms of physics, the gauge transformation (14.53) corresponds to a change
of the phase of the electron ﬁeld ψ.
It is typical for gauge ﬁeld theory that the phase change of the electron
ﬁeld, ψ(x) →eiθ(x)ψ(x), given by the function θ = θ(x) depends on
space and time.
14.3.3 The Gauge Field Approach
In quantum ﬁeld theory, try to ﬁx gauge potentials by using convenient
gauge conditions.
Folklore
It turns out that the computation of physical eﬀects in quantum electrody-
namics is easier to handle if we pass to a special variant of the equations of
motion based on a special choice of the four-potential (also called gauge po-
tential) A0, A1, A2, A3. This procedure will allow us to use the classical wave
equation and to reduce the study of photons, electrons, and positrons to in-
teracting harmonic oscillators (see Vol. II). The Lorentz condition (14.54)
below is the prototype of a gauge condition.
Special variant of the equations of motion in quantum electrody-
namics. Our goal is to modify the equations of motion (E1), (E2) in quantum
electrodynamics on page 791. To this end, recall the 4-current density vector
Jα
QED(x) := −eψ(x)γαψ(x)
and the wave operator 2 := ∂α∂α = ∂2
0 −∂2
1 −∂2
2 −∂2
3. Now choose a ﬁxed
function λ : R →R, and consider the following equations.
(M1) Wave equations for the gauge potential (photon ﬁeld):
2Aα(x) + (λ(x) −1)∂α∂βAβ(x) = Jα
QED(x),
α = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(M2) Dirac equation for the electron ﬁeld:
iγα∂αψ(x) −meψ(x) = −eAα(x)γαψ(x).
Furthermore, we deﬁne Fαβ := ∂αAβ −∂βAα. The equations above refer to
all space-time points x ∈M4.

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
795
Proposition 14.5 Each smooth solution of the system (M1), (M2) which
satisﬁes the Lorentz condition
∂αAα(x) = 0
on
M4
(14.54)
is a solution of the equations of motion (E1), (E2) in quantum electrodynam-
ics.
Proof. The Bianchi identity (14.47) follows immediately from the deﬁnition
of Fαβ, by antisymmetry. Furthermore, by the Lorentz condition,
∂αF αβ = ∂α(∂αAβ −∂βAα) = 2Aβ = Jβ
QED.
This is the Maxwell system (14.48).
2
In order to simplify the approach as much as possible, physicists prefer
to use the gauge function λ(x) := 1. This is called the Feynman gauge.
Generally, we expect that
Physical processes in quantum electrodynamics are invariant under
gauge transformations.
This fundamental principle is called the gauge invariance principle. In partic-
ular, we expect that the ﬁxing of the gauge potential by some gauge condition
does not inﬂuence the ﬁnal physical results that can be measured in physi-
cal experiments (e.g., cross sections in scattering processes or the energies of
bound states.)
Special variant of the principle of critical action. Again let Ωbe a
nonempty bounded open subset of the 4-dimensional space-time M4. Set
SQED[A, ψ] :=

Ω
LQED d4x
along with the Lagrangian density
LQED := Lfree + eLint
where eLint := −Jα
QEDAα, and
Lfree := 1
2Aα2Aα + 1
2(1 −λ(x))(∂βAβ)2 + ψ(iγα∂α −me)ψ.
Here, the smooth function λ : R →R is ﬁxed. Now consider the variational
problem
SQED[ψ, A, ψ] = critical!
(14.55)
along with ﬁxed boundary values of A and ψ on ∂Ω.
Theorem 14.6 (i) Each smooth solution A, ψ of (14.55) satisﬁes both the
wave equation (M1) and the Dirac equation (M2) on Ω.
(ii) If, in addition, the Lorentz condition ∂βAβ = 0 on Ωis fulﬁlled, then
A, ψ satisﬁes the equations of motion (E1), (E2) in quantum electrodynamics.

796
14. The Response Approach
Proof. Ad (i). Choose smooth test functions hα : Ω→R, α = 0, 1, 2, 3,
which have compact support, that is, hα ∈D(Ω). Deﬁne the function
J (τ) := SQED[A + τh, ψ],
τ ∈R.
The variational problem (14.55) is equivalent to ˙J (0) = 0 for all test functions
hα ∈D(Ω), α = 0, 1, 2, 3. Explicitly,

2hα2Aα + 1
2Aα2hα + (1 −λ(x))∂βAβ · ∂αhα −Jα

Integration by parts yields

(2Aα)hα d4x.
Since (2Aα)hα = (2Aα)hα,

Ω

2Aα −(1 −λ(x))∂α∂βAβ −JQED

hα d4x = 0.
By the real variational lemma from Sect. 10.4.1 on page 542,
2Aα −(1 −λ(x))∂α∂βAβ −Jα
QED = 0.
This is the wave equation (M1). In order to get the Dirac equation (M2), we
set
J (τ) := SQED[A, ψ + τh],
τ ∈R
where hj ∈D(Ω) for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. We now argue as in Problem 14.11.
Ad (ii). Use Proposition 14.5.

Motivation of the action functional in quantum electrodynamics.
Let Ωbe a bounded open subset of M4. Choose the Lagrangian density
L := −1
4FαβF αβ + ψ(iγα∇α −me)ψ,
and consider the principle of critical action

Ω
L d4x = critical!
(14.56)
along with given boundary values of A and ψ on ∂Ωand the side condition
∂αAα(x) = 0
on
Ω.
(14.57)
This problem is obtained from the original problem (14.52) by adding the
Lorentz condition (14.57). Motivated by the Lagrange multiplier rule, we
introduce the modiﬁed Lagrangian density
Lλ := L −1
2λ(x)(∂βAβ(x))2,

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
797
and we study the modiﬁed unconstrained variational problem

Ω
Lλ d4x = critical!
(14.58)
along with given boundary values of A and ψ on ∂Ω.
Proposition 14.7 For given smooth function λ : R →R, the variational
problem (14.58) is equivalent to the principle of critical action (14.55) in
quantum electrodynamics.
Proof. We have to show that

Ω
Lλd4x =

Ω
LQED d4x + const
for ﬁxed boundary values of A and ψ on ∂Ω. Here, the constant depends
on the boundary values. In other words, we have to prove that the two La-
grangian densities Lλ and LQED only diﬀer by a null Lagrangian density (see
Problem 14.5). In fact,
FαβF αβ = (∂αAβ −∂βAα)(∂αAβ −∂βAα)
= 2∂αAβ · ∂αAβ −2∂αAβ · ∂βAα.
Integration by parts yields

Ω
FαβF αβ d4x = −2

Ω
Aβ∂α∂αAβ + ∂αAα · ∂βAβ d4x + const
where the constant corresponds to the boundary terms. Hence

Ω
−1
4FαβF αβ d4x =

Ω

2Aβ2Aβ + 1
2(∂βAβ)2 d4x + const.
The other terms of Lλ and LQED remain unchanged.

14.3.4 The Extended Action Functional with Source Term
We now want to apply the response approach to quantum electrodynamics.
In fact, we will use a combination of
• the bosonic model from Sect. 7.24 for photons and
• the fermionic model from Sect. 9.7 for electrons and positrons.
To this end, we replace the principle of critical action (14.52) by the extended
principle of critical action
SQED,ext[A, ψ] = critical!
(14.59)

798
14. The Response Approach
by adding source terms. We are looking for smooth functions A and ψ whose
components lie in the space S(R4). Here, we set
SQED,ext := SQED + Ssource
(14.60)
with
SQED :=

M4(Lfree + eLint)d4x,
Ssource :=

M4 Lsource d4x.
The corresponding Lagrangian densities are given by
Lfree : = 1
2Aαηαβ2Aβ + ψ(iγα∂α −me)ψ,
eLint : = −Jα
QEDAα = eψAαγαψ,
Lsource : = Aα(x)Jα
A(x) + J (x)ψ(x) + ψ(x)J(x).
Observe that we use the Feynman gauge, λ(x) ≡1. The source terms are
given by
J(x) :=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
J1(x)
J2(x)
J3(x)
J4(x)
⎞
⎟

⎠,
J (x) :=

⎜
⎜
⎝
J 1(x)
J 2(x)
J 3(x)
J 4(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠.
Moreover, we set ψ := ψ†γ0 and J := J †γ0. The modulus e of the electric
charge of the electron plays the role of the coupling constant. In our energetic
system of units introduced on page 768, we have
e2 = 4πα =
4π
137.04
where α is the ﬁne structure constant. This means that the dimensionless
coupling constant κ = e is small in quantum electrodynamics.
Theorem 14.8 Each smooth solution of the extended principle of critical
action (14.59) satisﬁes the following equations.
(i) Photon ﬁeld:
ηαβ2Aβ = −Jα
A −eψγαψ,
α = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(ii) Electron ﬁeld:
(iγα∂α −me)ψ = −J −eAαγαψ.
(iii) Positron ﬁeld:
ψ(iγα∂α + me) = J + eψAαγα.
By convention, the diﬀerential operator ∂α acts on the function ψ in (iii).
The proof proceeds similarly to the proof of Theorem 14.6.

14.3.5 The Response Function for Photons
Let us switch oﬀthe interaction between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the
electron ﬁeld by setting the coupling constant equal to zero, that is, e = 0.
From the photon ﬁeld equation of Theorem 14.8(i) we obtain the following
regularized response equation
ηαβ(2 −iε)Aβ = −Jα
A,
α = 0, 1, 2, 3
along with the regularizing parameter ε > 0. For the solution, we formally
write
Aα(x) =

M4 Rαβ,ε(x −y)Jβ
A(y)d4y,
x ∈M4, α = 0, 1, 2, 3.
The matrix function (Rαβ,ε) is called the response function for photons.
Explicitly,
Rαβ,ε(x) := −ηαβRε(x).
(14.61)
Recall that
Rε(x) := −

(2π)4

M4
e−ipx
p2 + iε d4p,
x ∈M4.
We also deﬁne Dαβ,ε(x) := −iRαβ,ε(x). Hence
Dαβ,ε(x) = −iηαβ
(2π)4

M4
e−ipx
p2 + iε d4p,
x ∈M4.
(14.62)
Formal motivation for the response function. It follows from
(2 −iε)Aα = −Jα
A
along with (14.18) on page 774 that
Aα(x) = −

M4 Rε(x −y)Jα
A(y)d4p.
This yields (14.61).
Rigorous deﬁnition of the Feynman propagator for photons. Mo-
tivated by the formal considerations above, for α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3, we deﬁne the
tempered distributions
Dαβ
F
:= −ηαβGF .
The matrix DF := (Dαβ
F ) is called the Feynman propagator for photons. By
(14.34) and (14.35) on page 781, we get

(14.64)
Finally, we deﬁne the tempered distributions Rαβ := iDαβ
F . As desired by the
formal motivation (14.62), this deﬁnition yields
Rαβ = ηαβ
(2π)4

M4
e−ipx
p2 + 0+i d4p.
14.3.6 The Response Function for Electrons
Set e = 0. From Theorem 14.8(ii) we get the following linearized response
equation for the electron:
(iγα∂α −me)ψ = −J.
We will show below that the formal solution looks like
ψ(x) =

M4 Rel(x −y)J(y)d4y,
x ∈M4
along with the deﬁnition of the response function for electrons:
Rel(x) := (iγα∂α + me)Rε(x),
x ∈M4.
(14.65)
We also deﬁne SF (x) := −iRel(x). Formally, this yields
SF (x) =
i
(2π)4 · (iγα∂α + me)

M4
e−ipx
p2 −m2e + iε d4p.
Here, we choose the regularization parameter ε > 0. Hence
SF (x) =
i
(2π)4

M4
iγαpα + meI
p2 −m2e + iε · e−ipx d4p.
Formal motivation of the response function for electrons. First
set ε = 0. By (14.21) on page 775,
(2 + m2
e)R(x) = δ(4)(x),
x ∈M4.
For the Dirac–Pauli matrices, γαγβ + γβγα = 2ηαβI. This implies Dirac’s
magic formula
(iγα∂α −me)(iγβ∂β + me) = −2 −m2
e.
(14.66)

14.3 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
801
In fact, the product (iγα∂α −me)(iγβ∂β + me) is equal to
−1
2(γαγβ + γβγλ)∂α∂β −m2
e = −ηαβ∂α∂β −m2
e = −2 −m2
e.
Hence
(iγα∂α −me)Rel(x) = −(2 + m2
e)R(x) = −δ(4)(x).
Secondly, the formal deﬁnition (14.65) represents a regularization of the ex-
pression obtained by the formal proof.
Rigorous deﬁnition of the Feynman propagator for electrons.
Motivated by the formal considerations above, we deﬁne the tempered dis-

SF := (iγα∂α + me)GF,me.
(14.67)
By (14.30) and (14.31) on page 780, this implies
(iγα∂α −me)SF = iIδ

SF =

By deﬁnition, the correlation functions are the functional derivatives of the
generating functional (J , JA, J) →Z(J , JA, J) at vanishing source terms,
J = 0 and JA = 0, J = 0. In other words, the functional Z = Z(J , JA, J) is
the generating functional for the correlation functions in quantum electrody-
namics. For example, switching oﬀthe interaction by setting e = 0, we get
the Feynman propagators for photons and electrons. Explicitly, by (14.70)

14.3.9 The Magic LSZ Reduction Formula
Using the extended quantum action functional Z(J ; JA, J; ψ, A, ψ) from Sect.
14.3.7, the scattering functional S(ψ, A, ψ) for electrons, positrons, and pho-
tons in quantum electrodynamics is deﬁned by
S(ψ, A, ψ) := Z(0, 0, 0; ψ, A, ψ)
Z(0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0) .
The scattering function
Sn,m,l(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym, z1, . . . , zl)
is deﬁned by the functional derivative
δn+m+lS(ψ, A, ψ)
δψ(x1) · · · δψ(xn)δA(y1) · · · δA(ym)δψ(z1) · · · δψ(zl)
at the point ψ = ψ = 0, A = 0. Parallel to Sect. 14.2.5, the S-matrix elements
can be constructed by using the scattering functions and the free particle
functions. Moreover, as in Theorem 7.48 on page 482, it is possible to relate
the scattering functional S(ψ, A, ψ) to the generating functional Z(J , JA, J)
of the correlation functions by the magic LSZ reduction formula. A detailed
study of the S-matrix in quantum electrodynamics along with interesting
physical applications can be found in Volume II.

14.3.10 The Mnemonic Functional Integral
The basic functional integral of quantum electrodynamics reads as follows:
Z(J , JA, J) = N

eiSQED,ext Dψ DA Dψ.
(14.72)
The explicit form of the extended action functional
SQED,ext[ψ, A, ψ; J , JA, J]
can be found in (14.60) on page 797. The factor N has to be chosen in such
a way that
Z(0, 0, 0) = 1.
Concerning the functional integral (14.72), the components of the photon
ﬁeld A have to be integrated over the space S(R4). Furthermore, the com-
ponents of ψ, ψ, J, J represent independent Grassmann variables. Extending
the rigorous arguments from Sect. 7.26 on page 477 and Sect. 9.7 on page
519 in a formal manner to inﬁnite dimensions, we obtain
• the magic quantum action formula from Sect. 14.3.8 and
• the magic LSZ formula on the S-matrix in quantum electrodynamics from
Sect. 14.3.9.
Therefore, the functional integral (14.72) is called the global quantum action
principle of quantum electrodynamics.
Let us emphasize again that the functional integral (14.72) is only
to be understood as a very convenient mnemonic tool, but not as a
rigorous mathematical object.
For a detailed study of the approach to quantum ﬁeld theory via functional
integrals, we refer to Faddeev and Slavnov (1980). In particular, Faddeev and
Slavnov compute the S-matrix as the limit of evolution operators by using an
operator calculus based on the so-called holomorphic representation, which
diagonalizes creation and annihilation operators.
In the next chapter, we will study the operator approach to quantum
ﬁeld theory. We will show there how the S-matrix arises as a quite natural
consequence of the Dyson series which is closely related to Lagrange’s classical
variation-of-the-parameter method.
Problems
The principle of critical action is the most important method in physics in order
to derive basic equations in a very eﬀective way.11 The following problems concern

is not stated explicitly. In addition, the set Ωis tacitly assumed to be nonempty.
First recall the following classical deﬁnition. For a smooth function J : R →R, the
point τ0 is called a critical point of J iﬀ
˙J (τ0) = 0. By deﬁnition, the solutions of
the problem
J (τ) = critical!,
τ ∈R
are precisely the critical points of J . For example, the function J (τ) := τ 3 has the
unique critical point τ0 = 0. Let us now generalize this to variational problems. In
what follows, we will use the real and the complex variational lemma from Sect.

the function
L0 := Ax(x, y, u) + Au(x, y, u)ux + By(x, y, u) + Bu(x, y, u)uy

15. The Operator Approach
Dyson’s magic formula for the S-matrix represents a far-reaching gener-
alization of Lagrange’s variation-of-the-parameter method in celestial me-
chanics.
Folklore
In Chap. 14, we have described the approach to quantum ﬁeld theory which
can be traced back to Feynman’s approach in the 1940s based on the Feynman
rules for Feynman diagrams and the representation of propagators by func-
tional integrals. Typically, this approach does not use operators in Hilbert
spaces, that is, the methods of functional analysis do not play any role. His-
torically, in the 1920s quantum mechanics was ﬁrst based on operator theory
by Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Dirac, Pauli, and von Neumann. In order to
understand Feynman’s very eﬀective approach, Dyson related this to opera-
tor theory via the magic Dyson formula for the S-matrix.1 Conceptually, the
advantage of operator theory is that the duality between particles and waves
is formulated in a very transparent manner.
• The waves appear as solutions of classical wave equations. These equations
arise as equations of motion from the classical principle of critical action.
• The particles appear after introducing creation and annihilation operators.
• The free quantum ﬁeld is a linear combination of creation and annihila-
tion operators where the coeﬃcients are classical wave functions (that is,
solutions of the free equations of motion).
The disadvantage of operator theory is the fact that there arise serious math-
ematical diﬃculties in applying the rigorous theory of functional analysis to
quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model in particle physics. These
diﬃculties are caused by the interactions which are related to nonlinearities.
Basic strategy. Let us describe the main steps of the approach in this
chapter. In what follows, we will use

15. The Operator Approach
• a ﬁnite number of creation and annihilation operators,
• the quantized ﬁnite Fourier series for the free quantum ﬁeld (Fourier quan-
tization),
• the computation of the 2-point Green’s function of the free quantum ﬁeld
via Cauchy’s residue theorem,
• the magic Dyson formula for the S-matrix as an axiom,
• the Wick theorem in order to compute S-matrix elements and to represent
them as Feynman diagrams which are very close to physical intuition.
Finally, we will show how one can compute cross sections of scattering pro-
cesses by means of S-matrix elements. In order to get rigorous formulas in
each order of perturbation theory, we put the system in a box of ﬁnite volume,
we consider a ﬁnite time interval, and we use a ﬁnite lattice in 4-dimensional
space (i.e., energy space and 3-dimensional momentum space).
This is the best approach to scattering processes in quantum ﬁeld
theory from the point of view of physical intuition.
This approach has to be complemented by the method of renormalization.
This means that we have to study the limit where
• the box goes to R3,
• the ﬁnite time interval goes to R,
• the ﬁnite energy interval goes to R, and
• the ﬁnite lattice in 4-dimensional momentum space goes to R4.
Explicitly, we have to add counterterms in order force the existence of this
limit.

units with ℏ= c = 1.

• We put the quantum ﬁeld in a box C(L) in 3-dimensional Euclidean position
space. The box has side length L and volume V = L3; the position vectors
of C(L) have the form
x = x1i + x2j + x3k,
x1, x2, x3 ∈[−L

where i, j, k is a right-handed orthonormal system of vectors.
• We observe the quantum ﬁeld during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] of length
T > 0.
• The set C(L) × [−T
2 , T
2 ] lies in the 4-dimensional space-time M4.
• The truncated lattice G(N) in the 3-dimensional momentum space consists
of all the momentum vectors
p = (m1i + m2j + m3k) · ∆p
where m1, m2, m3 are integers with |m1|, |m2|, |m3| ≤N and ∆p := 2π/L.
Finally, recall that the discrete Dirac delta function of the lattice G(N) is
given by2
δG(N)(p) := δp,0

p ∈G(N)

15. The Operator Approach

all 4-vectors p,
δdis(p)2 =

T →+∞.
(15.5)
Thus, for large time T , we can use the approximation
δdis(p)2 =
VT
(2π)4 · δdis(p).
We will frequently use this formula when computing cross sections of scat-
tering processes. Mnemonically, physicists write
(δ4(p))2 =
VT
(2π)4 · δ4(p).
Action functional. The action functional on the cube C(L) is given by
S[ϕ] :=

2ϕ(2 + m2
0)ϕ + κLint(ϕ) d3x
for all smooth functions ϕ : C(L) →C which have the period L with respect
to the three position variables x1, x2, x3. Here, Lint(ϕ) := −ϕ4.
Energy. By Sect. 13.8.2 on page 760, the energy of the ﬁeld ϕ in the cube
C(L) at time t is equal to

Truncation of energy. For the length of the momentum vectors of the

15.1.2 Fourier Quantization
The idea of Fourier quantization is to consider solutions of the Klein–Gordon
equation in the form of ﬁnite Fourier series and to replace the Fourier coeﬃ-
cients by creation and annihilation operators. This way we obtain free quan-
tum ﬁelds. Later on, we will use the free quantum ﬁeld in order to construct
the S-matrix operator S(T ) by using Dyson’s magic formula. The operator S
allows us to compute transition probabilities for scattering processes.

that our choice of the normalization constant Np yields the right energy
operator of the quantized ﬁeld.

ﬁcients ap, a†

(15.7)
along with
[ap, aq]−= 0,
[a†

for all

Recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA. Explicitly, we get

apaq = aqap,

(15.8)
We also postulate the existence of a state Φ0 such that ⟨Φ0|Φ0⟩= 1 and
apΦ0 = 0
for all
p ∈G(N).
(15.9)
After this replacement, the operator-valued function ϕfree from (15.6) de-
scribes a free quantum ﬁeld of meson particles. As we will motivate below,
3 Recall that the symbol I denotes the identity operator.

818
15. The Operator Approach
• the state Φ0 is called ground state (or vacuum state) of the free quantum
ﬁeld,
• the operator ap is called annihilation operator, and
• the adjoint operator a†
p is called creation operator.
The properties of these operators will be studied thoroughly in Volume II.
Such operators arose in the early days of quantum mechanics in connection
with the quantization of systems of uncoupled harmonic oscillators. It follows
from (15.8) and (15.9) that
⟨a†
pΦ0|a†
pΦ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|apa†
pΦ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|(I + a†
pap)Φ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|Φ0⟩= 1.
The energy operator. Motivated by Sect. 15.1.1, the energy operator
of the free quantum ﬁeld ϕfree is given by
H :=

C(L)
1
2 ˙ϕfree(x, t)2 + 1
2(∂ϕfree(x, t))2 + 1
2m2
0ϕfree(x, t)2 d3x.
Let us show that
H =

In fact, for the time derivative,
˙ϕfree(x, t) = i

p∈G(N)

pe−ipx eiEpt)Np.
Similarly, for the derivative with respect to the position vector x,
∂ϕfree(x, t) = i

p∈G(N)
p(apeipx e−iEpt −a†
pe−ipx eiEpt)Np.
By the orthogonality relation (15.3),

Since E2

p = a†

The vacuum energy. For the mean energy of the quantum ﬁeld in a
vacuum, it follows from apΦ0 = 0 that
Evacuum = ⟨Φ0|HΦ0⟩= 1

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
819
Observe that the mean vacuum energy Evacuum becomes inﬁnite if N →+∞.
That is, if the number of grid points in momentum space goes to inﬁnity.
This fact is one of the reasons for the appearance of inﬁnities in quantum
ﬁeld theory.
The Stone–von Neumann theorem. Note the following crucial fact.
It is dangerous to postulate the existence of mathematical objects
which have prescribed properties.
The point is that such objects may not exist. To illustrate this, let us ﬁrst
show that the commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators
postulated above cannot be realized in a ﬁnite-dimensional4 Hilbert space
X. To this end, assume that there are linear operators apj : X →X which
satisfy the commutation relations
apja†
pk −a†
pkapj = αδjkI,
j, k = 1, . . . , n
where α is a nonzero complex number. Computing the trace,
αδjk tr(I) = tr(apja†
pk) −tr(a†
pkapj) = 0.
This implies α = 0, a contradiction.
However, we will show in Volume II that there exists a realization of
the ﬁnite number of creation and annihilation operators ap, a†
p indexed by
p ∈G(N) which satisﬁes the commutation relations postulated above. These
operators are linear and unbounded operators on some inﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space, and they are uniquely determined up to unitary equivalence.
This is the content of the famous Stone–von Neumann theorem.5
It was shown by G˚arding and Wightman in 1954 that the uniqueness
result fails for an inﬁnite number of creation and annihilation operators.6
This is one of the typical mathematical diﬃculties in quantum ﬁeld theory.
To circumvent this diﬃculty, we will use
• the lattice approximation with a ﬁnite number of creation and annihilation
operators
• combined with a passage to the continuum limit (see Sect. 15.1.8).
If, in contrast to the lattice approach, one starts with the continuum model,
then one has to ﬁx the representation of the inﬁnite family of creation and
annihilation operators. However, since there exist unitarily inequivalent rep-
resentations of the commutation relations, there is an element of arbitrariness.
4 We exclude the trivial space X = {0}.

15. The Operator Approach
15.1.3 The Free 2-Point Green’s Function
Using the free meson quantum ﬁeld ϕ from (15.6), we deﬁne
G2,G(N),free(x, t; y, s) := ⟨0|T (ϕfree(x, t)ϕfree(y, s))|0⟩.
This function is called the free 2-point Green’s function of the meson quantum
ﬁeld ϕfree with respect to the lattice G(N) in momentum space. Let us set
p = (p, p0). The deﬁnition of the chronological operator T can be found on
page 744.
Theorem 15.1 For all space-time points x = (x, t) and y = (y, s) in M4

Proof. (I) Commutation relation. First let t > s. Then
G2,G(N),free(x, y) = ⟨Φ0|ϕfree(x, t)ϕfree(y, s)Φ0⟩.
Since apΦ0 = 0, we get ⟨Φ0|a†
pΦ⟩= ⟨apΦ0|Φ⟩= 0. Hence
⟨Φ0|apaqΦ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|a†
paqΦ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|a†
pa†
qΦ0⟩= 0.
Furthermore, it follows from apa†
q = δp,qI + a†
qap and ⟨Φ0|Φ0⟩= 1 that
⟨Φ0|apa†
qΦ0⟩= δp,q.
Thus, by (15.6) along with ∆3p = (2π)3/V,

(II) Secondly, let t < s. Then
G2,G(N),free(x, y) = ⟨Φ0|ϕfree(y, s)ϕfree(x, t)Φ0⟩.

G2,G(N),free(x, y) =

Here, the decisive role is played by the pole at the point p0 = −Ep. Finally,
letting R →+∞, the contribution coming from the semicircle of radius R in
the upper half-plane goes to zero. In this connection, note that
|e−ip0(t−s)| = e−(s−t)ℑ(p0)
where s −t > 0 and ℑ(p0) > 0 in the open upper half-plane.
If t > s, then we replace the upper semi-circle by a lower semi-circle. This

(15.12)
Here, we set
Lint(ϕfree)(t) :=

C(L)
Lint(ϕfree(x, t)) d3x
where Lint(ϕ) = −ϕ4. For the deﬁnition of the chronological operator T , we
refer to page 744. The free quantum ﬁeld ϕfree can be found in (15.6) on
page 817. In particular, Lint is a polynomial with respect to creation and
annihilation operators. The symbol
: Lint(ϕfree)(t) :
denotes the normal product of Lint(ϕfree)(t). By deﬁnition, the normal prod-
uct is obtained by reordering the terms in such a way that all of the annihi-
lation operators stand on the right of the creation operators. For example,
: apa†
q : = a†
qap,
: a†
qap : = a†
qap,
(15.13)
and : apa†
qar : = a†
qapar. Normal products will be studied in Sect. 15.1.5
below. Observe the following crucial fact.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
823
The S-matrix operator describes interactions of the quantum ﬁeld
in powers of the coupling constant by using nonlinear terms which
depend on the known free quantum ﬁeld.
This way, in the setting of perturbation theory, interactions can be reduced
to the interaction-free situation. Formula (15.12) is motivated by the rigorous
ﬁnite-dimensional formula (7.53) on page 390 which follows from Lagrange’s
variation-of-the-parameter method.
In the present case, we will use formula (15.12) as the deﬁnition for
the crucial S-matrix operator S(T ).

Transition probabilities. Let Φ and Ψ be two normalized states. This
means that ⟨Φ|Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩= 1. The complex number
⟨Ψ| S(T )Φ⟩
is called the transition amplitude from the state Φ to the state Ψ during the
time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. Furthermore, the nonnegative number
|⟨Ψ| S(T )Φ⟩|2
is called the transition probability from the state Φ to the state Ψ during the
time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. In what follows, we will discuss
• how to compute transition amplitudes, and hence
• transition probabilities.
We will reduce this to the computation of vacuum expectation values.
Basic tricks for computing vacuum expectation values. The fol-
lowing relations are crucial.

15. The Operator Approach
Let B1, . . . , Bn be creation or annihilation operators. For computing the vac-
uum expectation value
⟨Φ0|B1B2 · · · BnΦ0⟩,
we will use (R3) along with (R4) in order to achieve (R1) or (R2).
Example 15.2 For all p, q, r ∈G(N), we have ⟨Φ0|apa†

15.1.5 The Main Wick Theorem
The main Wick theorem is the basis for computing scattering processes
via Feynman diagrams.
Folklore
Recall that, by deﬁnition, the normal product
: A1A2 · · · An :
of creation and annihilation operators is obtained by moving the annihilation
operators from left to right. For example,
: a†
sapaqa†
r : = a†
sa†
rapaq.
Normal products have the following two properties.
(P1) Normal product principle: The vacuum expectation value of a normal
product vanishes,
⟨Φ0| : A1A2 · · · An : Φ0⟩= 0.
This follows from (R2) above.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
825
(P2) Normal products are invariant under permutations of the factors.
The last statement follows from the commutation relations
apaq = aqap,
a†
pa†
q = a†
qa†
p.
Contractions. Let A, B be creation or annihilation operators. The con-
traction C(AB) of A with B is deﬁned by
C(AB) := ⟨Φ0|ABΦ0⟩.
Explicitly, by (R2) above,
C(apa†
q) = ⟨Φ0|(apa†
q −a†
qap)Φ0⟩= δp,q.
Furthermore, again by (R2),
C(a†
paq) = C(a†
pa†
q) = C(apaq) = 0.
Paired normal products. It is useful to consider normal products where
pairs of factors are replaced by contractions. Generally, we deﬁne
Ckl : A1A2 · · · An : = C(AkAl) : A1 · · · Ak−1Ak+1 . . . Al−1Al+1 · · · An : .
For example, C12 : AB : = C(AB)I, and
C34 : ABCD : = C(CD) : AB : .
We will also consider iterations of this procedure. For example,
C12C35 : ABCDE : = C(AB)C(CE) : D : .
Trivially, : D := D. As we will show below,
BC = : BC : +C12 : BC :
(15.16)
and
ABC = : ABC : +C12 : ABC : +C13 : ABC : +C23 : ABC : . (15.17)
Furthermore,
ABCD = : ABCD : +C12 : ABCD : +C13 : ABCD :
(15.18)
+C14 : ABCD : +C23 : ABCD : +C24 : ABCD : +C34 : ABCD :
+C12C34 : ABCD : +C13C24 : ABCD : +C14C23 : ABCD : .
These are special cases of the following ﬁrst Wick theorem.

826
15. The Operator Approach
Proposition 15.4 Each product of creation and annihilation operators is
the sum of all possible paired normal products.
Proof. Ad (15.16). Note that [ap, a†
q]−= C(apa†
q) I. Hence
apa†
q = a†
qap + [ap, a†
q]−= : apa†
q : +C(apa†
q) I.
If BC is any one of a†
paq, apaq or a†
pa†
q, then BC = : BC : and C(BC) = 0.
Ad (15.17). (I) Let A := a†
p. By (15.16),
ABC = A : BC : +AC12 : BC :
Moreover, A : BC : = : ABC : and C(AB) = C(AC) = 0.
(II) Let A := ap. Then : ABC : = : BC : A. By (15.16),
: ABC : = BCA −C12 : BC : A.
Hence
BCA = : ABC : +C12 : BC : A.
Using the commutator, BCA = B [C, A]−+ BAC. Hence
BCA = B [C, A]−+ [B, A]−C + ABC
= −C(AC) : B : −C(AB) : C : +ABC.
This yields (15.17). For n factors, we proceed by induction.
2
By the normal product principle (P1) on page 824, the vacuum expecta-
tion value of a normal product vanishes. Therefore, it follows from (15.18)
that
⟨Φ0|ABCDΦ0⟩= C(AB)C(CD) + C(AC)C(BD) + C(AD)C(BD).
This is the sum of all possible total pairings. Moreover, it follows from (15.17)
that
⟨Φ0|ABCΦ0⟩= 0.
This means that the ﬁrst Wick theorem substantially simpliﬁes the compu-
tation of vacuum expectation values by cancelling redundant terms. For the
general situation
τ := ⟨Φ0| : A1A2 · · · An : Φ0⟩,
n = 1, 2, . . .,
the same argument yields the following second Wick theorem.
Proposition 15.5 If n is odd, then τ = 0. If n is even, then τ is equal to
the sum of all possible products
⟨Φ0|Ai1Ai2Φ0⟩⟨Φ0|Ai3Ai4Φ0⟩· · · ⟨Φ0|Ain−1AinΦ0⟩
where i1, i2, . . . in is a permutation of 1, 2, . . . , n. Moreover, ij < ij+1 for odd
indices j = 1, 3, . . .n −1 and i1 < i3 < i5 < . . . < in−1.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
827
This corresponds to all possible total contractions of the normal product.
Total contractions are also called total pairings.
Time-ordered products. Our next goal is the main Wick theorem below
which refers to the vacuum expectation values of time-ordered products. We
assume the following.
(A) The functions A, B, C, D and Aj, j = 1, . . . , n, are ﬁnite linear combi-
nations of creation and annihilation operators where the coeﬃcients are
complex-valued functions depending on space and time.
For example, the function A(x) := ϕfree(x) satisﬁes this assumption. Deﬁne
the time-ordered contraction between A and B by
C(AB)(x, y) := ⟨Φ0|T (A(x)B(y))Φ0⟩.
For example,
C(ϕfree(x)φfree(y)) = G2,free,G(N)(x, y).
Moreover, deﬁne time-ordered paired normal products by setting
Ckl : A1A2 · · · An : = C(AkAl) : A1 · · · Ak−1Ak+1 . . . Al−1Al+1 · · · An : .
For time-ordered contractions, there holds the relation
T (BC) =
: BC : +C12 : BC :
(15.19)
along with
T (ABC) =
: ABC : +C12 : ABC : +C13 : ABC : +C23 : ABC :
and
T (ABCD) =
: ABCD : +C12 : ABCD : +C13 : ABCD : +C14 : ABCD :
+ C23 : ABCD : +C24 : ABCD : +C34 : ABCD :
+ C12C34 : ABCD : +C13C24 : ABCD : +C14C23 : ABCD : .
Let us prove (15.19). In fact, by (15.16),
B(x, t)C(y, s) = : B(x, t)C(y, s) : +C12 : B(x, t)C(y, s) :
along with
C(y, s)B(x, t) = : C(y, s)B(x, t) : +C12 : C(y, s)B(x, t) : .
Since normal products are invariant under permutations of the factors, we
get
C(y, s)B(x, t) = : B(x, t)C(y, s) : +C12 : C(y, s)B(x, t) : .
By the deﬁnition of the chronological operator T on page 744, we obtain
(15.19). Similarly, we get the expressions above for T (ABC) and T (ABCD).

15. The Operator Approach
In general, the ﬁrst and second Wick theorem remain valid if we replace
products (resp. contractions) by time-ordered products (resp. time-ordered
contractions). In particular, we obtain the following result.
The main Wick theorem. Consider the vacuum expectation value of
the following time-ordered product
τ := ⟨Φ0|T (A1A2 · · · An)Φ0⟩,
n = 1, 2, . . .
where Aj = Aj(x), j = 1, 2, . . ., n, are operator-valued functions which sat-
isfy assumption (A) above.
Theorem 15.6 If n is odd, then τ = 0. If n is even, then τ is equal to the
sum of all possible products
⟨Φ0|T (Ai1Ai2)Φ0⟩⟨Φ0|T (Ai3Ai4)Φ0⟩· · · ⟨Φ0|T (Ain−1Ain)Φ0⟩
where i1, i2, . . . in is a permutation of 1, 2, . . .n. Moreover, ij < ij+1 for odd
indices j = 1, 3, . . .n −1 and i1 < i3 < i5 < . . . < in−1.
Special notation. In order to best understand the language of Feynman
diagrams to be introduced below, let us change the notation. We write
AB := C(AB) = ⟨Φ0|T (AB)Φ0⟩
and
⟨Φ0|T (A1 · · · Aj · · · Ak · · · An)Φ0⟩
= AjAk⟨Φ0|T (A1 · · · Aj−1Aj+1 · · · Ak−1Ak+1 · · · An)Φ0⟩.
For example, the main Wick theorem (Theorem 15.6 ) tells us that
⟨Φ0|T (ABCD)Φ0⟩
is equal to the sum of all possible total pairings:
⟨Φ0|T (ABCD)Φ0⟩+ ⟨Φ0|T (ABCD)Φ0⟩+ ⟨Φ0|T (ABCD)Φ0⟩
= AB · CD + AC · BD + AD · BC.
Such total pairings will be used systematically in the proof of Prop. 15.8
below.
We now want to investigate the fundamental relation of the Wick theo-
rem to transition amplitudes, transition probabilities, and cross sections of
scattering processes.

15.1.6 Transition Amplitude
Let us study the following scattering process (Fig. 15.2(a)).
• There are two ingoing particles with momentum vectors pin and qin and
• two outgoing particles with momentum vectors pout and qout.
We introduce the ingoing particle state
Φin := αa†
pina†
qinΦ0
and the outgoing particle state
Φout := βa†
pouta†
qoutΦ0.
Here, the unit vector Φ0 denotes the ground state (vacuum state). Moreover,
we set α := 1 if pin ̸= qin. Otherwise, α := 1/2. Similarly, we choose β := 1
if pout ̸= qout. Otherwise, β := 1/2.
Proposition 15.7 (i) ⟨Φin|Φin⟩= 1 and ⟨Φout|Φout⟩= 1.
(ii) ⟨Φout|Φin⟩= 0 if the momentum vectors of the incoming particles are
diﬀerent from the momentum vectors of the outgoing particles.
Proof. By Prop. 15.5 on page 826,
⟨a†
pa†
qΦ0|a†
ra†
sΦ0⟩= ⟨Φ0|aqapa†
ra†
sΦ0⟩= δq,rδp,s + δq,sδp,r.
For example, if p = r and q = s along with r ̸= s, then we get the value 1. 2
Let us now study the transition amplitude
τ := ⟨Φout| S(T )Φin⟩.
By the Dyson series (15.14), we obtain
τ = τ0 + κτ1 + κ2τ2 + . . .
with τ0 := ⟨Φout|Φin⟩. Explicitly,

Proof of Theorem 15.8. To simplify notation, we write the symbol ϕ
instead of ϕfree. The basic ideas of the proof are the following ones.
• We apply the main Wick theorem to the S-matrix elements.
• This way, vacuum expectation values of time-ordered products are reduced
to products of time-ordered contractions.
• The time-ordered contractions can be represented graphically as the basic
elements of Feynman diagrams (see Table 15.1).
• The products of time-ordered contractions can be represented graphically
by Feynman diagrams (see Figs. 15.3-15.5 on page 835).
Ad (i). By the main Wick theorem (Theorem 15.6) on page 828,
f(x) = ⟨Φ0|apoutaqout : ϕ(x)ϕ(x)ϕ(x)ϕ(x) : a†
pina†
qinΦ0⟩+ . . .

832
15. The Operator Approach
We have to sum over all possible total pairings. The dots stand for the re-
maining total pairings. Note the crucial fact that pairings between operators
of a normal product vanish. Therefore,
⟨Φ0| . . . : ϕ(x)ϕ(x)ϕ(x)ϕ(x) : . . . Φ0⟩= 0.
Consequently, such pairings drop out. Hence
f(x) = apoutϕ(x) · aqoutϕ(x) · ϕ(x)a†
pin · ϕ(x)a†
qin + . . .
Using the expression for the free ﬁeld ϕ from (15.6) on page 817,
apϕ(x) = apa†
peipxNp = eipxNp.
Similarly, we obtain the remaining formulas of Table 15.1 on page 831. Hence
f(x) =

This is the claim (i) up to the factor 24. In order to understand the appearance
of the symmetry factor 24, we will use the following graphical language which
is the prototype of the method of Feynman diagrams.
• Draw a vertex along with four free arms (Fig. 15.2(a) on page 829).
• Equip one of the arms with both the symbol pin and an incoming arrow.
Mathematically, this corresponds to the contraction7
ϕ(x)a†
pin
Physically, this represents an incoming particle with momentum vector pin.
• Similarly, we equip the remaining arms with the symbols
qin,
pout,
qout
and one incoming arrow and two outgoing arrows, respectively. Mathemat-
ically, this corresponds to the contractions
7 See Table 15.1 on page 831. Recall that we write ϕ instead of ϕfree.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
833
ϕ(x)a†
qin,
apoutϕ(x),
aqoutϕ(x),
respectively. Physically, this represents an incoming particle and two out-
going particles with momentum vectors qin, pout, qout, respectively. For
example, the Feynman diagram from Fig. 15.2(a) on page 829 corresponds
to the product
apoutϕ(x) · aqoutϕ(x) · ϕ(x)a†
pin · ϕ(x)a†
qin.
All of the remaining total pairings are obtained by using all possible permu-
tations of the arms. Finally, each of these 4! = 24 total pairings yields the
same contribution to τ1.
Ad (ii). We obtain
g(x1, x2) = a(x1, x2) + b(x1, x2) + . . .
(15.20)
By deﬁnition, a(x1, x2) is equal to the total pairing
⟨Φ0|T (apoutaqout : ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1) :: ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)
× ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2) : a†
pina†
qin)Φ0⟩.
Therefore, a(x1, x2) is equal to the following product of time-ordered con-
tractions:
apoutϕ(x1)aqoutϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)a†
pinϕ(x2)a†
qin.
This corresponds to the left-hand diagram of Fig. 15.2(b) on page 829. Fur-
thermore, by deﬁnition, b(x1, x2) is equal to
apoutϕ(x1)aqoutϕ(x2)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)a†
pinϕ(x1)a†
qin.
This corresponds to the right-hand diagram of Fig. 15.2(b). The dots from
(15.20) stand for the sum of the remaining total pairings. As in the proof
of (i) above, all of the terms vanish which contain pairings inside a normal
product. For example,
⟨Φ0|T (. . . : ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1) :: ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2) : . . .)Φ0⟩= 0.
and
⟨Φ0|T (. . . : ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1)ϕ(x1) :: ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x2) : . . .)Φ0⟩= 0.
Such pairings drop out in (15.20).

This is the claim of Theorem 15.8(ii) for j = 1, up to the symmetry factor 4

Fig. 15.5. Equivalent Feynman diagrams
(III) Symmetry factors and Feynman diagrams. In Theorem 15.8 (ii) on
page 830, we claim that
τ2 = 4τ21 + 4τ22.
The symmetry factor comes from the remaining total pairings. In order to
compute the remaining total pairings from (15.20), we will use the elegant and
highly eﬀective graphical language of Feynman diagrams which is pictured
in Figs. 15.3–15.5. This language is the key to modern elementary particle
physics.

836
15. The Operator Approach
Now to the point. All the possible total pairings can be obtained in the
following way.
• Draw two vertices equipped with the symbols x1 and x2. Each vertex has
four arms.
• Select four arms and equip them with the symbols pin, pout, qin, and qout.
This way we get the external lines (Fig. 15.3 on page 835).
• Consider all possible pairs of free arms which belong to diﬀerent vertices
and connect them. This way we get the internal lines. There are two pos-
sibilities in Fig. 15.4(b), (c) on page 835.
• Equip the two internal lines with the 4-momentum symbols p and q.
• Introduce arrows. We attribute ingoing (resp. outgoing) arrows to pin, qin
(resp. pout, qout). The arrows of the internal lines point from x2 to x1.
• Finally, draw all diagrams that can be constructed by the method described
above. Totally, we get 8 diagrams which correspond to all total pairings
from (15.20).
The external lines correspond to real particles. The internal lines are called
virtual particles, by physicists. Similarly, as in (I) above, we assign the tran-
sition amplitude

and virtual particles at the vertex xr. Ingoing (resp. outgoing) particles are
equipped with the positive (resp. negative) sign.
Let us now study the phenomenon of equivalent Feynman diagrams.
The point is that diﬀerent Feynman diagrams may generate the same transi-
tion amplitude. For example, one checks easily that each of the eight possible
Feynman diagrams yields the same transition amplitude as one of the two
diagrams from Fig. 15.2(b) on page 829. This produces the symmetry factor

The two diagrams (a) and (b) from Fig. 15.5 on page 835 are called equivalent.
They diﬀer by a permutation of the vertices x1 and x2.

15.1.7 Transition Probability
We want to discuss how one passes from transition amplitudes to transition
probabilities, which are crucial for the computation of cross sections.
To this end, we will use the quantization of the classical phase space.
Let us consider the scattering process from Sect. 15.1.6 pictured in Fig.
15.2(a) on page 829. In terms of classical mechanics, we have conservation of
momentum vectors,
pout + qout = pin + qin,
(15.21)
and conservation of energy,
Epout + Eqout = Epin + Eqin
(15.22)
where Ep :=

m2
0 + p2. Let us consider a proper scattering process. This
means that pout ̸= pin. This implies qout ̸= qin.
The key formula for the transition probability. Consider the mo-
mentum vector p = p1i + p2j + p3k, and set
pout + ∆3p := {p : pj
out ≤pj ≤pj
out + ∆p, j = 1, 2, 3}.
By deﬁnition, the number

is the probability for the following event that happens in the large cell C(L)
of volume V during the large time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] :
• Two ingoing particles P and Q having momentum vectors pin and qin,
respectively, are scattered such that
• the momentum vectors of the outgoing particles P and Q are living in the
cell pout + ∆3p and qout + ∆3p, respectively.
Motivation of the key formula. In ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
the square of the modulus of the transition amplitude yields the correspond-
ing transition probability. However, in the present case, there arises a contin-
uum of states. Therefore, we have to modify the deﬁnition of the transition
probability. To this end, let x = xout(t) and y = yout(t), t ∈[−T
2 , T
2 ] be
the classical trajectories of the outgoing particles P and Q in position space,
respectively. The corresponding trajectory of the particle pair in phase space
reads as
x = xout(t), p = pout(t), y = yout(t), q = qout(t),
t ∈[−T
2 , T
2 ].
This trajectory lives in the subset
P := (C(L) × pout + ∆3p) × (C(L) × qout + ∆3p)
of the 12-dimensional phase space. The set P has the volume
meas P = V∆3p · V∆3p.
Now to the point. In the SI system, the quantity length × momentum has
the physical dimension of action. Therefore, the volume meas P has the same
physical dimension as h6 where h denotes the Planck constant. According to
semi-classical quantum statistics, the dimensionless quantity
meas P
h6
= V∆3p
(2πℏ)3 · V∆3p
(2πℏ)3
is the number of quantum states, which corresponds to the phase volume of
the set P. By convention, we use the energetic system in this chapter. Here,
ℏ= 1. This motivates the deﬁnition of W(T, V) from (15.23).

are scattered. The symbol ′ indicates that the trivial non-scattering case
given by pout = pin, qout = qin is excluded.
The goal. The total probability Wtot(T, V) depends on the large length
T of the time interval [−T
2 , −T
2 ], the large volume V of the box C(L), and
the small length ∆p of the lattice in momentum space. We are looking for a
quantity which describes the asymptotic behavior of Wtot(T, V) as T →∞
and V →∞. We will show in the next section that in the center-of-mass
system, there exists the limit
σtot :=
lim
T →∞, V→∞
Wtot(T, V)V
vrelT
where vrel is the relativistic relative velocity of the two ingoing particles. Since
the probability Wtot(T, V) is dimensionless, the so-called total cross section
σtot has the physical dimension of area.
15.1.8 Scattering Cross Section
Consider a scattering process where a homogeneous stream of ingoing parti-
cles P hits a homogeneous stream of ingoing particles Q. Physicists measure
the number Nin of ingoing particles P and the number Nout of outgoing (scat-
tered) particles P. These numbers refer to a box C(L) of large volume V and
a time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] of large length T . We will work in the center-of-mass
system which will be discussed below (Fig. 15.6).

15. The Operator Approach
For a small coupling constant κ, we will get M = 24κ in ﬁrst order of
perturbation theory. The general deﬁnition of M(ϑ) will be given below.
Formula (15.25) represents an approximation which is valid for large vol-
ume V, large length T of the time interval[−T
2 , T
2 ], and small coupling con-
stant κ.
The diﬀerential cross section is crucial in physics, since it does not
depend on the volume V of the box, the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ], and
the relative velocity vrel.
Using the diﬀerential dΩ= 2π cos ϑ · dϑ of the solid angle, physicists also
write
dσ =

Terminology. Let us explain the notation used above. The ﬁrst (resp.
second) homogeneous incoming particle beam consists of particles P (resp.
Q) of mass m0 and momentum vector pin (resp. qin). After scattering, the
particle P (resp. Q) has the momentum vector pout (resp. qout). In the center-
of-mass system, classical conservation of momentum and energy yields
pout + qout = pin + qin = 0
and Epout + Eqout = Epin + Eqin with Ep :=

m2
0 + p2. This implies
pin = −qin,
pout = −qout
along with Epout = Eqout = Epin = Eqin. Hence,
|pin| = |qin| = |pout| = |qout|.
Let ϑ denote the scattering angle (see Fig. 15.6 on page 839). Explicitly,
pinpout = |pin| · |pout| cos ϑ = |pin|2 · cos ϑ.
Furthermore, let us use the following notation for particle numbers.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
841
• Let Nin be the number of incoming particle pairs P, Q in the box C(L) of
volume V = L3 during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. For the particle density
of P (resp. Q), we get ϱP = ϱQ = Nin/V.
• Let Nout be the number of scattered particle pairs P, Q in the box C(L)
during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ].
• Let Nout([ϑ1, ϑ2]) be the number of scattered particle pairs P, Q, in the
box C(L) during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ], whose scattering angle lies in
the interval [ϑ1, ϑ2].
By deﬁnition, the relativistic relative velocity between the incoming particles
P and Q is equal to

Equivalently, vrel = 2|pin|/

proximation vrel = 2|pin|/m0, which is the non-relativistic relative velocity.
If we introduce the current density
jin := vrelϱP = vrelNin

then it follows from (15.25) that the total cross section is given by
σtot = Nout

Here, we use the normalization factor Np := 1/

2VEp. For example, it
follows from Theorem 15.8(i) on page 830 that M = 24κ, in ﬁrst-order per-
turbation theory. In the general case, M depends on qout and pout. We write
M = M(pout, qout).

15.1.9 General Feynman Rules for Particle Scattering
Feynman diagrams represent graphically the Wick theorem.
Folklore
The arguments used in the proof of Theorem 15.8 on page 830 can be im-
mediately generalized to an arbitrary order of perturbation theory. Let us
discuss this. We are given
• k ingoing particles of mass m0 with pairewise disjoint momentum vectors
p1,in, . . . , pk,in and
• l outgoing particles of mass m0 with pairewise disjoint momentum vectors
p1,out, . . . , pl,out. Let k + l be even.
We want to compute the transition amplitude

p1,ina†
p2,in · · · a†

Φout := a†

pl,outΦ0.
We want to study a proper scattering process. That is, we assume that
Φin ̸= Φout. For ﬁxed n = 1, 2, . . ., it is our goal to determine the coeﬃ-
cient τn. Parallel to Sect. 15.1.8, the transition probability can be obtained
by multiplying |⟨Φout|S(T )Φin⟩|2 with the number of cells in the phase space.
Feynman diagrams. We will use Feynman diagrams with k ingoing
particles, l outgoing particles, and m internal lines such that 4n = k+l+2m.
Proceed as follows.

844
15. The Operator Approach
• Draw n vertices equipped with the symbols x1, . . . , xn. Each vertex has
four arms.
• Select k + l arms and equip them with the symbols
p1,in, . . . , pk,in, p1,out, . . . , pl,out.
This yields the external lines corresponding to external particles.
• Consider all possible pairs of free arms which belong to diﬀerent vertices
and connect them. This yields the internal lines. To diﬀerent internal lines,
we assign diﬀerent 4-momentum vectors p, q, . . . In contrast to the external
particles, the components of the 4-momentum vectors p, q, . . . are not cou-
pled by the energy relation. For example, p0 is independent of p. Therefore,
we say that the internal lines correspond to virtual particles which violate
the usual relation Ep =

m2
0 + p2 between energy and momentum of real
particles.
• Introduce arrows. We attribute ingoing arrows (resp. outgoing arrows) to
the momentum vectors p1,in, . . . , pk,in (resp. p1,out, . . . , pl,out). The arrows
of internal lines point from xi to xj where i > j.
• Finally, draw all possible diagrams that can be constructed by the method
described above.
Feynman rules. To each Feynman diagram with n vertices we assign a
product function
α := (−i)n(2π)4n
n!
abc · · ·
(15.27)
where the factors a, b, . . . depend on the vertices and the internal lines. Inte-
gration over the internal lines then yields a complex number β. Finally, the
desired coeﬃcient τn is the sum of all possible numbers β. The number β is
obtained in the following way. Let us ﬁrst describe the factors a, b, c, . . . from
(15.27).
• An ingoing particle with momentum vector pin corresponds to the factor
Npin :=
1

2VEpin
where Epin :=

m2
0 + p2
in.
• An outgoing particle with momentum vector pout corresponds to the factor
Npout.
• Each vertex xk generates the factor
δdis
⎛
⎝


j=1
±pj
⎞
⎠
where p1, p2, p3, p4 are the 4-momentum vectors of the particles at the
vertex xk. The positive (resp. negative) sign belongs to ingoing (resp. out-
going) particles.

15.1 The ϕ4-Model
845
• Each internal line with 4-momentum vector p corresponds to the factor
1
p2 −m2
0 + iε
with the small regularization parameter ε > 0.
• Finally, we integrate the product function α. Explicitly, to each internal
line with 4-momentum vector p = (p0, p), we assign the 4-dimensional
integration
 Emax
−Emax
dp0

p∈G(N)
∆3p . . .
Summarizing, concerning the m internal lines, we get an integration of
dimension 4m.
Symmetry factors. Two Feynman diagrams are called equivalent iﬀ
they only diﬀer by a permutation of the vertices. Equivalent Feynman dia-
grams make the same contribution to the transition amplitude. To simplify
the approach, we only consider one representative of each class of equiva-
lent Feynman diagrams. We compensate this by cancelling the factor n! from
(15.27).
It is possible that additional symmetries of the Feynman diagrams are
responsible for the fact that further Feynman diagrams make the same con-
tribution to the transition amplitude. This simpliﬁes the computation by
taking additional symmetry factors into account. For example, the 4! = 24
permutations of the four arms of Fig. 15.2(a) on page 829 generate the sym-
metry factor 24.
Formal continuum limit. To simplify the approach, physicists pass over
to the formal continuum limit. To this end, they use the Feynman rules above
by applying the replacements
δdis(p) ⇒δ(p)
and

15.1.10 The Magic Gell-Mann–Low Reduction Formula for
Green’s Functions
The Dyson formula (15.12) on page 822 for the S-matrix operator S can be
used in order to construct the full n-point Green’s function for n = 1, 2, . . ..
Explicitly,

846
15. The Operator Approach
Gn(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ⟨0|T {ϕfree(x1)ϕfree(x2) · · · ϕfree(xn)S}|0⟩
⟨0|S|0⟩
.
(15.28)
Here, the symbols ϕfree and |0⟩denote the free quantum ﬁeld and the ground
state of the free quantum ﬁeld, respectively. In addition, T {. . .} represents the
chronological operator. Formula (15.28) is motivated by the rigorous discrete
formula from Theorem 7.33 on page 427, which is a consequence of Wick
rotation. Generalizing this theorem in a formal sense, we write
Gn(x1, . . . , xn) = lim
ε→+0
lim
T →+∞Gn(x1, . . . , xn; T, ε)
(15.29)
along with the regularized full n-point Green’s function
Gn(x1, . . . , xn; T, ε) := ⟨0|T {ϕfree(x1) · · · ϕfree(xn)S(T (1 −iε))}|0⟩
⟨0|S(T (1 −iε))|0⟩
.
Formula (15.29) is called the Gell-Mann–Low reduction formula for Green’s
functions. In the sense of Sect. 7.22 on page 424, we will also write
Gn(x1, . . . , xn) = ⟨0int|T (ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn))|0int⟩
where the symbols ϕ and |0int⟩formally denote the interacting quantum ﬁeld
and the ground state of the interacting quantum ﬁeld, respectively. A critical
discussion of these notions can be found in Sect. 13.5 on page 748.
15.2 A Glance at Quantum Electrodynamics
The application of the operator approach to quantum electrodynamics in-
cluding Feynman rules and renormalization will be studied in Volume II.
We will use creation and annihilation operators for electrons,
positrons, and photons.
Let us only mention the following points concerning renormalization. In quan-
tum electrodynamics, the original bare mass me and the bare charge −e of
the electron are replaced by the renormalized electron mass mren and the
renormalized electron charge −eren which coincide with the values measured
in physical experiments. The bare quantities me and −e only appear at the
very beginning of the renormalization process, but they are eliminated after
renormalization. We call this mass and charge renormalization. The physical
philosophy behind this reads as follows:
• The original Lagrangian density does not include quantum ﬂuctuations.
• In contrast to the classical theory, mass and electric charge of the electron
are the result of complicated quantum interaction processes. This yields
the values mren and eren which are observed in physical experiments.

15.3 The Role of Eﬀective Quantities in Physics
847
• The method of renormalization allows us to introduce renormalized param-
eters mren and −eren along with so-called radiative corrections to Feynman
diagrams. This way, we get close agreement with physical experiments. For
example, this allows us to compute the ﬁne structure of the spectrum of
the hydrogen atom (the Lamb shift) and the anomalous magnetic moment
of both the electron and the muon.
The renormalized parameters mren and −eren are also called eﬀective param-
eters.
15.3 The Role of Eﬀective Quantities in Physics
An important task of physics is to compute eﬀective physical constants
which average microphysical eﬀects on a macroscopic scale.
Folklore
There is a fundamental phenomenon which appears in all ﬁelds of physics:
Physical constants change under interactions.
This means that the interactions are of such a nice type that the typical
feature of the theory remains unchanged, but only a few physical constants
change their values. We use the term eﬀective (or renormalized) physical con-
stants. As a classical example, consider the propagation of light in a vacuum.
The speed of light is given by
c =
1
√ε0µ0
where ε0 and µ0 are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld constants of vacuum,
respectively. There are many materials where the interaction between light
and the molecules of the material is of such a type that the speed of light in
the material is given by
cmaterial =
1
√εµ.
Here, ε = εrelε0 and µ = µrelµ0 are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld constants
of the material, respectively. More precisely, the Maxwell equations do not
change their structure. On a microscopic level, there are complicated inter-
actions between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the molecules of the material.
Fortunately enough, on a macroscopic level, this can be described by the
simple replacement
ε0 ⇒ε,
µ0 ⇒µ
in the Maxwell equations. The ﬁnite factors
εrel = 1 + χel,
µrel = 1 + χmagn

848
15. The Operator Approach
are called renormalization factors. Moreover, χel and χmagn are called electric
and magnetic susceptibility, respectively.8
The point is that the renormalization factors are inﬁnite in quantum
ﬁeld theory.
This dramatically complicates the situation and calls for a very careful math-
ematical approach.
15.4 A Glance at Renormalization
The subject of interacting quantum ﬁelds is full of nonsense.9
Paul Dirac, 1981
Renormalization theory is a notoriously complicated and technical sub-
ject. . . I want to tell stories with a moral for the earnest student: Renor-
malization theory has a history of egregious errors by distinguished sa-
vants. It has a justiﬁed reputation for perversity; a method that works up
to 13th order in the perturbation theory fails in the 14th order. Arguments
that sound plausible often dissolve into mush when examined closely. The
worst that can happen often happens. The prudent student would do well
to distinguish sharply between what has been proved and what has been
plausible, and in general he should watch out!10
Artur Wightman, 1976
In 1951 Matthews and Salam11 formulated a requirement for renormaliza-
tion procedures that has become popularly known as the Salam criterion:
“The diﬃculty, as in all this work, is to ﬁnd a notation which is both concise
and intelligible to at least two persons, of whom one may be an author.”
Possibly there are many proofs of the renormalizability of quantum elec-
trodynamics which satisfy the Salam criterion. But we must confess that
none of us has yet qualiﬁed as that other person who is the guarantor of
the criterion. While there are today many standard texts which discuss
the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics, we are not aware of
any which represents a complete proof and in particular justiﬁes the claim
that only gauge invariant counterterms are required. We here submit to
you a direct and complete proof and we invite you to judge whether you
can vouch for the Salam criterion.12

15.4 A Glance at Renormalization
849
I shall roughly divide the history of renormalization theory into two main
chapters.
First the structure of the inﬁnities or “divergences” in physical quantum
ﬁeld theory such as electrodynamics was elucidated. A recursive process,
due to Bogoliubov and his followers,13 was found to hide these inﬁnities
into unobservable “bare ” parameters that describe the fundamental laws
of physics at experimentally inaccessible extremely short distances. Al-
though technically very ingenious, this solution left many physicists and
probably most mathematicians under the impression that a real diﬃculty
had been “pulled under the rug”.
It would be unfortunate however to remain under this impression. Indeed
the second chapter of the story, known under the curious and slightly
inaccurate name of the “renormalization group”, truly solved the diﬃculty.
It was correctly recognized by Wilson and followers that in a quantum
theory with many scales involved, the change of parameters from bare to
renormalized values is a phenomenon too complex to be described in a
single step.
Just like the trajectory of a complicated dynamical system, it must be
instead studied step by step through a local evolution rule. The change of
scale in the renormalization group plays the role of time in dynamical sys-
tems. This analogy is deep. There is a natural arrow of time, related to the
second principle of thermodynamics, and there is similarly a natural arrow
for the renormalization group evolution: microscopic laws are expected to
determine macroscopic laws, not the converse. The renormalization group
erases unnecessary detailed short scale information. . .
If we consider the universal character of the action principle both at the
classical and quantum level, and observe that the relation between micro-
scopic and macroscopic laws is perhaps the most central of all physical
questions, it is probably not an exaggeration to conclude that the renor-
malization group is in some deep sense the “soul” of physics.14
Vincent Rivasseau, 2002
Renormalization theory will play a crucial role in the following volumes.
At this point, we only want to discuss a few basic ideas. As an introduc-
tion into renormalization theory formulated in the language of physicists, we
recommend the textbooks by Nash (1978), Collins (1984), Veltman (1995),
Kugo (1997), Ryder (1999), and Zinn–Justin (2004). Renormalization theory
in terms of mathematics can be found in Manoukian (1983) and Rivasseau
(1991).
13 This is called the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) approach
to renormalization based on the introduction of counterterms which regularize
the divergent integrals by subtracting suitable integrands.

15. The Operator Approach
15.4.1 The Trouble with the Continuum Limit
To illustrate the typical situation, let us consider the lattice ϕ4-model from
Sect. 15.1.2 on page 817. In order to get the continuum model, we have to
carry out the following limits.15
(i) High energy limit: N →+∞. This implies Emax →+∞.
(ii) Low-energy limit: V →+∞. This implies ∆p →+0.
(iii) Large-time limit: T →+∞.
(iv) Regularization limit: ε →+0.
This corresponds to a passage from a ﬁnite number to an inﬁnite number
of degrees of freedom. Since light of low (resp. high) energy is violet (resp.
red), the high-energy (resp. the low-energy) limit is also called the ultraviolet
(resp. infrared) limit by physicists. The trouble is that, as a rule, these limits
do not exist.
To overcome this trouble, the main idea is to change the classical
Lagrangian by adding counterterms.
The mathematical prototypes of this technique are the Weierstrass theorem
and the Mittag–Leﬄer theorem considered in Sect. 8.5.1 on page 509. From
the physical point of view, the philosophy is that there arise additional quan-
tum ﬂuctuations in a quantum ﬁeld theory. Such quantum ﬂuctuations can
be described by the counterterms of the classical Lagrangian density.
15.4.2 Basic Ideas of Renormalization
The crucial point is that from the physical point of view, renormalization the-
ory allows us to pass from microscopic quantities to macroscopic quantities.
In contrast to the microscopic quantities, the macroscopic quantities can be
measured in physical experiments which depend on the available scale (e.g.,
the energy scale). In this context, the following two ideas play the decisive
role:
(i) The idea of counterterms.
(ii) The idea of essential and inessential scales.
Let us brieﬂy discuss this.
Counterterms. As a prototype, consider the ϕ4-model. Here, we replace
the classical Lagrangian density
L(ϕ, ∂ϕ) := 1
2ϕ(−2 −m2
0 + iε)ϕ −κϕ4
(15.30)
by the renormalized Lagrangian density
15 Recall that N is the number of lattice points, V is the volume of the box, and
∆p = 2π/L with V = L3. Moreover, we use the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ].

In order to motivate this, we want to sketch the method of dimensional
renormalization. This method was introduced by ’t Hooft and Veltman in
order to renormalize the electroweak Standard Model in particle physics.16
We start with the classical Lagrangian density L in 4-dimensional space-
time (Minkowski space M4) given in (15.30). In each order of perturbation
theory, we use the Feynman rules for the S-matrix elements. This way, we
get discrete integrals over the lattice in momentum space. Furthermore, the
formal continuum limit
N →+∞,
V →+∞,
∆p →+0
sends the discrete integrals to integrals over the 4-dimensional Minkowski
space. The point is that some of these integrals are divergent. This is caused
by the fact that the integrands decrease too slowly at inﬁnity. To overcome
this diﬃculty, physicists proceed in the following two steps.
Step 1: Dimensional regularization of integrals. We pass to the n-dimen-
sional Minkowski space Mn. To this end, we modify the Lagrangian density
by setting
Ln(ϕ, ∂ϕ) := 1
2ϕ(−2 −m2
0 + iε)ϕ −κλ4−nϕ4
(15.32)
with the parameter λ > 0 and n < 4. It is convenient to work in the mo-
mentum space (Fourier space). For low dimension n = 1, the integrals are
convergent. The point is that the integrals I(n) lead to functions which can
be continued analytically with respect to the complex variable n. For
n = 4 −δ,
we get analytic expressions with respect to δ which posses singularities at
δ = 0; this corresponds to the physically relevant dimension n = 4. A simple
example for dimensional regularization of algebraic Feynman integrals can be
found in Sect. 11.6.2 on page 636.
Step 2: Compensation for singularities by introducing counterterms into
the Lagrangian density. Explicitly, we start with the bare Lagrangian density
Ln from (15.32), and we set
mren := (m0 + ∆m)

Zϕ,
κren = (κ + ∆κ)Z2
ϕ,
ϕren =
ϕ

Zϕ
.

15. The Operator Approach
Here, ∆m and ∆κ are real parameters which correct the bare mass m0 and
the bare coupling constant κ, respectively. We call mren, κren, and ϕren the
renormalized mass, the renormalized coupling constant, and the renormalized
quantum ﬁeld, respectively. Using multipliers, we write
mren = m0
Zϕ
√Zm
,
κren = κZ2
ϕ
Zκ
.
Hence
ϕ = ϕren

Zϕ,
m2
0 = m2
ren
Zm
Zϕ
,
κ = κren
Zκ
Z2ϕ
.
Using this substitution, the original Lagrangian density Ln(ϕ, ∂ϕ, m0) is
transformed into the renormalized Lagrangian density
Lren(ϕren, ∂ϕren, mren)
from (15.31) above. The point is that the counterterms can be chosen in such
a way that the divergent terms can be cancelled after carrying out the limits
δ →0 and ε →0. The ﬁnal result only depends on
• the renormalized meson mass mren and
• the renormalized coupling constant κren.
The renormalized mass mren and the renormalized coupling constant κren are
unknown ﬁnite quantities. They have to be determined by physical experi-
ments.17
Observe the following peculiarity. The multiplicative renormalization con-
stant Zm depends on δ, and we have the limit Zm →+∞as δ →+0. This
means that m0 →+∞. Consequently, it is impossible to determine the pa-
rameter m0 from the renormalized mass mren measured in a physical experi-
ment. This means that the original bare mass parameter m0 has no physical
meaning at all. The following remarks are in order:
• The counterterms lead to additional Feynman diagrams.
• The procedure of renormalization is not uniquely determined. However,
the experience of physicists shows that diﬀerent renormalization methods
yield the same physics.
• There exist rescalings of the renormalized Lagrangian density which corre-
spond to the same S-matrix. Such rescalings form the so-called renormal-
ization group, which is extremely useful.
The method of dimensional renormalizaton method is widely used by physi-
cists in elementary particle physics. Interestingly enough, this method also
works extremely well for computing higher-order post-Newtonian approxima-
tions in gravitational physics (Einstein’s theory of general relativity). Such
computations are necessary in order to compute the collision of binary neu-
tron stars or binary black holes. This can be found in the paper by
17 Explicit computations can be found in Ryder (1999), pp. 308–329.

Essential and inessential scales. If one wants to pass from microscopic
quantities to macroscopic quantities, one has to distinguish between the es-
sential scale and the inessential scale. The behavior of the physical system on
the inessential scale can be replaced by suitable averages. This idea is used
systematically in the method of the renormalization group.18
Methods of renormalization theory. The most important methods
in renormalization theory read as follows:

(g) The Zimmermann forest formula and the importance of Hopf algebras.
(h) Gauge symmetries of functional integrals and the Ward–Takehashi iden-
tities and the Taylor–Slavnov identities for Green’s functions.
In what follows, we will discuss some basic ideas.
15.4.3 The BPHZ Renormalization
The important BPHZ renormalization method due to Bogoliubov, Parasiuk,
Hepp, and Zimmermann proceeds in the following steps.
(i) Feynman rules: We start with our lattice approach. In each order of
perturbation theory, we get well-deﬁned discrete integrals for the S-
matrix elements. Carrying out the formal continuum limit, we obtain
multi-dimensional integrals over products of the 4-dimensional momen-
tum space. The point is that some of the integrals are divergent, because
the integrands decrease too slowly at inﬁnity.
(ii) Regularization of divergent integrals: We subtract regularization terms
from the integrands of the divergent integrals. These regularization terms
correspond to suitable ﬁrst terms of the Taylor expansion of the inte-
grands. Prototypes can be found in Sect. 8.5.3 on page 511. The con-
vergence of the regularized integrals is guaranteed by Weinberg’s power-
counting theorem.
(iii) Renormalization: Add counterterms to the classical Lagrangian density
in order to compensate for the regularization terms. This leads to renor-
malized macroscopic physical parameters.
18 We recommend Duplantier and Rivasseau (2003).

15.4.4 The Epstein–Glaser Approach
In the BPHZ approach, there arise divergent integrals which have to be reg-
ularized. In 1973 Epstein and Glaser developed an alternative approach to
quantum ﬁeld theory which completely avoids divergent integrals for high en-
ergies.19 In terms of mathematics, this is an advantage of the Epstein–Glaser
approach.
By using the mathematical theory of tempered generalized functions,
ill-deﬁned quantities never appear.
We will study this in Volume II. The basic ideas read as follows.
(i) The iterative method for the generalized S-matrix: As the fundamental
object, we choose the generalized S-matrix,
S = S(g)
for all
g ∈S(R4).
This is an operator-valued tempered generalized function. That is, to
each test function g ∈S(R4), we assign a linear operator

15.4 A Glance at Renormalization
855
S(g) : X →X
on the complex Hilbert space X. Using ﬁrst physical principles (e.g.,
causality and pseudo-unitarity), we get an iterative method for comput-
ing the S-matrix,
S(g) = I + κS1(g) + κ2S2(g) + ...,
(15.33)
in each order of perturbation theory. Here, κ denotes the coupling con-
stant which measures the strength of the interaction. The ﬁrst-order
approximation S1(g) is determined by the interaction term of the La-
grangian density of the corresponding classical ﬁeld theory. It is crucial
that
All of the higher-order terms S2(g), S3(g), ... depend on the
ﬁrst-order term S1(g) by using the iterative method mentioned
above.
It turns out that the generalized S-matrix S = S(g) contains all the in-
formation about the interacting quantum ﬁeld under consideration. Ex-
plicitly, this concerns the computation of the following quantities:
• cross sections for scattering processes of elementary particles,
• decay rates of elementary particles,
• energies of bound states of elementary particles, and
• interacting quantum ﬁelds Ψ.
Therefore, it remains to compute the components S2, S3, ... of the gener-
alized S-matrix.
(ii) Regularization of tempered distributions: The following observation is
crucial for understanding renormalization theory. To emphasize the basic
idea, let us simplify the following considerations by dropping out details.
Roughly speaking, in each order of perturbation theory, the iterative
method determines the generalized S-matrix only up to a ﬁnite linear
combination of Dirac’s delta distribution and its derivatives, that is, we
obtain
Sn = (Sn)reg + cn0δ + cn1δ′ + ... + cnmδ(m).
(15.34)
In other words, ﬁrst physical principles do not determine the general-
ized scattering matrix S in a unique manner, but only up to certain
generalized functions which are not classical functions. Equivalently, this
means that, after Fourier transformation, the S-matrix component Sn is
determined up to a polynomial of order m in momentum space. 20 The
20 In contrast to the classical 1949 Dyson approach, the Epstein–Glaser approach
avoids the ill-deﬁned time-ordered product based on the crucial chronological
operator T . The singular part of (15.34) is caused by the singularities of the
Green’s functions.

856
15. The Operator Approach
expression (15.34) is obtained in the following way. We ﬁrst restrict our-
selves to test functions g which vanish outside a small disc Dr of radius
r about the origin. This choice of test functions allows us to perform the
iterative method in a natural way. We then study the limit r →0 by
using the sophisticated Steinmann renormalization theorem from Sect.
11.4.3 on page 620.
(iii) High-energy (ultraviolet) renormalization: The generalized S-matrix
S(g) depends on the free constants cn0, cn1, ... along with physical pa-
rameters, e.g., the bare electron mass me and the bare electron charge −e
in quantum electrodynamics. Our goal is to replace cn0, ..., cnm, me, −e
by eﬀective quantities that can be measured in a physical experiment,
e.g., the renormalized electron mass mren and the renormalized electron
charge −eren. To this end, we need additional physical information. In
this connection, the Ward identities and their generalizations play a cru-
cial role. These identities follow from additional quantum symmetries
(gauge symmetries).
(iv) Low-energy (infrared) renormalization: Note that the constant function
g ≡1 does not lie in the space S(R4) of test functions. In terms of
physics, this means that the approach (i) above corresponds to quantum
ﬁelds which are contained in a box of ﬁnite volume V. It remains to study
the limit V →+∞. In terms of test functions, this corresponds to the
limit
lim
k→∞gk(x) = 1
for all
x ∈R4
where the test functions g1, g2, ... lie in the space S(R4). Finally, we have
to study the limit limk→∞S(gk). For example, in quantum electrody-
namics, infrared renormalization corresponds to the limit
λ →+∞
where λ denotes the photon wave length. Such a limit is not always
reasonable from the physical point of view. In particular, if the universe
has a ﬁnite volume, then there exists a natural bound R for the photon
wave length,
λ ≤R,
where R denotes the maximal distance within the universe. Here, R is
a natural cut-oﬀfor the photon wave length λ. In this case, infrared
inﬁnities do not appear. It is thinkable that the infrared problem will
be settled in the framework of a uniﬁed theory for all four fundamental
interactions which relates the global structure of the universe to local
quantum physics. For concrete physical situations in quantum electro-
dynamics, infrared divergences do not arise, since they are compensated
for by so-called braking radiation (bremsstrahlung) caused by low-energy
photons. More precisely, the divergences only vanish after summing over
all of the Feynman diagrams which are related to this process.

15.4 A Glance at Renormalization
857
(v) Computation of quantum ﬁelds: Suppose that we know the generalized
S-matrix
S = S(g, J)
as a functional of the test function g and the external source J. Then,
the corresponding interacting quantum ﬁeld Φ can be obtained by means
of the following functional derivative,
Φ(χ, J) := S(0, J)−1 δS(0, J)
δg
(χ).
(15.35)
This deﬁnition dates back to Bogoliubov. In this setting, the interacting
quantum ﬁeld Φ is an operator-valued generalized function. That is, to
each test function χ ∈S(R4) and each external source J, we assign the
linear operator
Φ(χ, J) : X →X
on the Hilbert space X.
(vi) The convergence problem in perturbation theory: In 1951 Dyson in-
vented a heuristic physical argument which suggested that the pertur-
bation series (15.33) does not converge for small values of the coupling
constant κ. However, the classical 1916 Ritt theorem in complex function
theory tells us that each formal power series of the form (15.33) can be
viewed as an asymptotic series of some function f = f(κ) which is ana-
lytic on a circular sector in the complex plane. Here, the sector contains
suﬃciently small values κ > 0 of the coupling constant κ. This will be
discussed in Sect. 15.5 on page 860.
A detailed application of the Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum electro-
dynamics including Bogoliubov’s formula (15.35) can be found in the mono-
graph by
G. Scharf, Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: the Causal Approach,
Springer, New York, 1995.
Summarizing, the Epstein–Glaser approach tells us that renormalization the-
ory is related in a quite natural way to the theory of tempered distributions.
Historical remarks. Concerning the Bogoliubov formula (15.35) for
deﬁning full quantum ﬁelds in the Epstein–Glaser approach, let us make
the following comment. To simplify notation, set J = 0 in what follows. In
1929, Heisenberg and Pauli based quantum ﬁeld theory on the notion of a
local operator-valued quantum ﬁeld ϕ = ϕ(x). Here, to each space-time point
x = (x, t) they assigned an operator
ϕ(x) : X →X
on the Hilbert space X. In the framework of canonical quantization, the
quantum ﬁeld ϕ has to satisfy additional commutation (resp. anticommuta-
tion) rules. However, it turns out that such a notion is contradictory from

858
15. The Operator Approach
the mathematical point of view. In 1943 Heisenberg introduced the S-matrix
as a substitute for the quantum ﬁeld ϕ. In the Epstein–Glaser approach, the
quantum ﬁeld Φ is not a primary object, but it can be derived from the
generalized S-matrix. Formally, the relation between ϕ and Φ is given by
Φ(χ) =

R4 ϕ(x)χ(x)d4x
for all
χ ∈S(R4).
Intuitively, the quantum ﬁeld ϕ is a highly singular object. By forming mean
values over test functions χ, we arrive at a less singular mathematical object
denoted by Φ. The functional
χ →Φ(χ)
on the space S(R4) of test functions with values in a Hilbert space is called
a Hilbert space-valued generalized function (or a Wightman functional). The
representation of quantum ﬁelds by such functionals was studied ﬁrst by
Arthur Wightman21 in 1956.
15.4.5 Algebraic Renormalization
In 1974 it was recognized by Becchi, Rouet, and Stora, in their work on the
BRST symmetry invariance of gauge theories, that the use of the quan-
tum action principle leads to the possibility of a fully algebraic proof of
renormalizability of a theory characterized by a set of local rigid invari-
ances. . . The quantum action principle allows one to control the breaking
of a symmetry induced by a noninvariant subtraction scheme, helping then
to give an algebraic answer of restoring the symmetry through the addi-
tion of compensating noninvariant local counterterms. It is worthwhile to
emphasize that such algebraic proofs do not rely on the existence of a
regularization preserving of symmetries.
Olivier Piguet and Silvio Sorella, 1995
Algebraic Renormalization:
Perturbative Renormalization, Symmetries, and Anomalies22
As a rule of thumb, quantum ﬁeld theories related to elementary particles are
renormalizable, but the quantized gravitational force is not renormalizable in
the usual setting. This is one of the fundamental problems in the foundation
of a uniﬁed theory for all four fundamental forces in nature. A detailed proof
of the renormalizability of the electroweak Standard Model can be found in
the following paper:

15.4 A Glance at Renormalization
859
This paper uses the elegant and very eﬀective method of algebraic renor-
malization. This method combines the quantum action principle (that is,
the Dyson–Schwinger equation for the full generating functional) with the
method of BRST symmetry to be discussed in Sect. 16.7 on page 890.23
The method of algebraic renormalization can also be used in order to prove
the renormalizability of the simplest supersymmetric variant of the Stan-
dard Model in particle physics, called the minimal supersymmetric standard
model. We refer to the basic paper by
W. Hollik, E. Kraus, M. Roth, C. Rupp, K. Sibold, and D. St¨ockinger,

Physics B639 (2002), 3–65.

volved. For the renomalization of quantum electrodynamics in a Euclidean
setting, we recommend

malizability, Springer, Berlin, 1988.
15.4.6 The Importance of Hopf Algebras
Behind renormalization there lurks a monster called the motivic Galois
group. This monster is responsible for the rich mathematical structure of
renormalization theory.
Folklore
It was discovered by Kreimer in 1994 that behind renormalization theory
there exists a symmetry encoded into some Hopf algebra.24 As an introduc-
tion, we recommend
D. Kreimer, Knots and Feynman Diagrams, Cambridge University Press,
2000.
The crucial point is as follows. In the BPHZ renormalization method, it was
discovered by Zimmermann that Bogoliubov’s iterative method for determing
the regularized integrals can be formulated in terms of some global forest
formula which elegantly describes the structure of the additional Feynman
diagrams.25 Kreimer discovered that Zimmermann’s forest formula can be un-
derstood best by using the coinverse (also called the antipode) of a suitable
Hopf algebra which is related to Feynman diagrams. Furthermore, Connes
23 We recommend O. Piguet and S. Sorella, Algebraic Renormalization, Springer,
Berlin, 1995.
24 Note that, roughly speaking, Hopf algebras are dual constructions to algebras.
They appear at several places in mathematics (e.g., combinatorics, diﬀerential
operators, power series expansions, representation theory of groups, and algebraic
topology). See Chap. 3 of Vol. II.

ization theory is closely related to the famous Riemann–Hilbert problem. We

The basic philosophy is the following one. The experience of physicists shows
that renormalization theory is full of symmetries reﬂected by marvellous re-
lations. The experience of mathematicians shows that symmetries are always
governed by an appropriate symmetry group. In terms of renormalization
theory, the symmetry group was discovered by Connes and Marcolli in an
abstract way by using the theory of categories. This huge group is called the
motivic Galois group of renormalization. The renormalization groups used by
physicists in speciﬁc situations are representations of one-dimensional sub-
groups of the motivic Galois group.
15.5 The Convergence Problem in Quantum Field
Theory
15.5.1 Dyson’s No-Go Argument
In 1951 Dyson discovered a simple argument which suggested that the
S-matrix series diverges. His reasoning was the following: Suppose one
were to calculate a physical observable in a power series in the coupling
constant, κ. If this series is convergent for some positive value of κ, it
must converge in some circle of radius κ. The series must therefore also
converge on some interval of the negative real axis. Now a negative coupling
constant κ corresponds to a world in which like charges would attract

15.5 The Convergence Problem in Quantum Field Theory
861
one another and opposite charges would repel each other. However, if κ
is negative, then a state which contains a large number N, of electron-
positron pairs in which the electrons are clustered together in a region
Ω1 and the positrons are clustered together in another region Ω2 of space
far from Ω1, would have an energy lower than that of the ground state
(vacuum) for N large enough. . . The ground state is therefore unstable
relative to such states. Since the larger the number of pairs, the more
pronounced the eﬀect becomes, the higher order terms in the power series
expansion must become more and more important so that the series cannot
converge. . . Quantum electrodynamics was over for Dyson in 1951, when
he found this heuristic argument that the perturbation theory diverges.

15.5.2 The Power of the Classical Ritt Theorem in Quantum
Field Theory
The question of what conditions a formal power series must satisfy in order
to occur as an asymptotic development has a surprisingly simple answer
for circular sectors at the origin: there are no such conditions.
Reinhold Remmert, 1991
Theory of Complex Functions27
Let a0, a1, ... be a sequence of complex numbers. The convergent or divergent
power series expansion
a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + ...
is called a formal power series expansion. The following Ritt theorem shows
that each formal power series expansion is the asymptotic series of an ap-
propriate analytic function f = f(κ). Observe that the function f is not
determined uniquely by the formal power series expansion. In physical ap-
plications, the variable κ represents the coupling constant. We are given the
circular sector
C := {κ ∈C : 0 < |κ| < r, −η < arg κ < η}
where the radius r is a ﬁxed positive number, and the positive angle η is less
than π (Fig. 15.7 on page 862).

Explicitly, this means that we have
f(κ) = a0 + a1κ + . . . + anκn + rn(κ)
for all
κ ∈S
and each n = 0, 1, 2, . . . where the remainder is of the form rn(κ) = εn(κ)κn
with εn(κ) →0 as κ →0 on S. This theorem was obtained by Ritt in 1916.28

proof is to construct the function
f(κ) :=

with convergence factors of the form cn(κ) := 1 −e−bn/√κ. Observe that the
function f is not holomorphic in a small neighborhood of the origin κ = 0,
but only on a circular sector. The 1916 Ritt theorem is closely related to
Dyson’s ‘no go’ argument from Sect. 15.5.1.29

Minkowskian versus Euclidean models. First we are going to ﬁx
the terminology. Let us choose D = 2, 3, . . . (dimension of the space-time
manifold), and let N = 3, 4, . . . (order of nonlinearity). We will distinguish
between the
• Minkowskian case (indeﬁnite metric on the D-dimensional space-time), and
• the Euclidean space (deﬁnite metric on the D-dimensional space-time).
The Euclidean case is much simpler to treat mathematically than the
Minkowskian case. The Euclidean case allows us to apply the well-elaborated
machinery of stochastic processes and probabilistic calculus. The passage
from the Minkowskian case to the Euclidean case corresponds to the passage
t →−it
(15.36)
from real time to imaginary time.
(M) The Minkowskian ϕN
D-model: Choose σ := 1 and α := 1. This model is
based on the following action functional
S[ϕ] := α(Sfree[ϕ] + κSint[ϕ])

Here, the coupling constant κ ≥0 and the real potential parameter λ
are ﬁxed. The Euler–Lagrange equation corresponding to the principle of
critical action,

This is a nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation (meson model).
(E) The Euclidean ϕN
D-model: We use the action functional S[ϕ] along with
equation (15.38) by setting σ := −1. According to the time transforma-
tion (15.36), the diﬀerential dDx passes over to −idDx. Therefore, we
choose now α := −i.
In the general case, the correlation functions read as
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) :=

S(RD) ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn) eiακSint[ϕ] · eiαSfree[ϕ] Dϕ

S(RD) eiακSint[ϕ] · eiαSfree[ϕ] Dϕ
where n = 1, 2, . . . Setting dµ := eiαSfree[ϕ]Dϕ, we get
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) :=

S(RD)
n
k=1 ϕ(xk) · eiακSint[ϕ] dµ(ϕ)

S(RD) eiακSint[ϕ] dµ(ϕ)

In the Euclidean case (E), we obtain
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) =

In this case, the formula for the correlation function Cn(x1, . . . , xn) (also
called Schwinger function) is well-deﬁned if we use a probabilistic measure µ
on the function space S(RD) (or, more generally, on the space S′(RD) of tem-
pered distributions). Such measures generalize the Wiener measure which was
introduced by Wiener in 1923 in order to rigorously describe the probabilis-
tic structure of the Brownian motion.30 Multiplying the function Cn by test

a probabilistic measure on the space S′(RD) of tempered distributions, which
is an extension of the measure
dν(ϕ) := eκSfree(ϕ)dµ(ϕ)
on the space S(RD) of test functions. Concerning (15.39), we integrate over
all tempered distributions ϕ ∈S′(RD).
15.6.1 Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory
In 1965, G˚arding and Wightman formulated axioms for relativistic quantum
ﬁelds.31 We will study the axiomatic approach to quantum ﬁeld theory in
Volume IV on quantum mathematics. Essential ingredients of the axiomatic
approach to quantum ﬁeld theory concern
• the 1956 Wightman axioms for vacuum expectation values,
• the Wightman reconstruction theorem for quantum ﬁelds,
• the 1965 G˚arding–Wightman axioms,
• the 1973 Osterwalder–Schrader axioms on Schwinger distributions,
• the Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction theorem for quantum ﬁelds in the
Euclidean setting, and
• the 1964 Haag–Kastler axioms formulated in the language of nets of local
C∗-algebras (algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory).

tivistic quantum ﬁeld theory, Arkiv f¨or Fysik 28 (1965), 128–184.

15.6 Rigorous Perspectives
867
The Haag–Kastler approach elaborates the frame of local quantum theory in
Minkowski space. We refer to the monographs by Res Jost (1965), Streater
and Wightman (1968), Emch (1972), Reed and Simon (1972), Vols. 2, 3,
Simon (1974), Glimm and Jaﬀe (1981), Bogoliubov et al. (1975), (1990),
Baumg¨artel and Wollenberg (1992), Iagolnitzer (1993), Baumg¨artel (1995),
Haag (1996), and Araki (1999).
At this point, let us only sketch a few basic ideas. We will start with the
notion of Poincar´e transformation
x′ = Ax + a
between the space-time coordinates x := (x1, x2, x3, x0 = t) and x′ of two
arbitrary inertial systems. Here, the real invertible (4 × 4)-matrix A is the
superposition of a rotation of the space coordinates, a Lorentz boost,
x′1 = x1 −vt
√
1 −v2 ,
x′2 = x2,
x′3 = x3,
t′ = t −vx1
√
1 −v2 ,
and space or time reﬂections. The reﬂections may drop out. The parameter
v with 0 ≤v < 1 describes the relative velocity between the two inertial
systems. Moreover, the map x →x+a represents a space translation or time
translation. Such a Poincar´e transformation will be denoted by the symbol
(A, a). All of the Poincar´e transformations form a group called the Poincar´e
group.32 The G˚arding–Wightman axioms in the four-dimensional space-time
M4 read as follows.33
(GW1) Relativistic symmetry. There exists both a complex Hilbert space X
called state space and a unit vector Ω0 called ground state (or vacuum).
Moreover, the relativistic Poincar´e group acts as symmetry group on the
Hilbert space X. More precisely, there exists a map
(A, a) →U(A, a)
(15.40)
which assigns a unitary operator U(A, a) : X →X to each element
(A, a) of the Poincar´e group. The map (15.40) is a group morphism, that
is, it sends products of Poincar´e transformations to products of unitary
operators.
(GW2) Spectral property. By the Stone theorem on one-parameter unitary
groups in Hilbert spaces, there exist self-adjoint operators
Pµ : dom(Pµ) ⊆X →X,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3
such that
32 This fundamental non-compact group and its representations will be studied in
Volume III on gauge ﬁeld theory.
33 We use basic notions from functional analysis which can be found in Zeidler
(1995), Vol. 1.

868
15. The Operator Approach
U(I, a) = ei P3
µ=0 aµPµ
for all a = (a0, a1, a2, a3)d in R4. The operator H := P0 is called the
Hamiltonian (or energy operator) of the quantum ﬁeld. Moreover, the
operators P1, P2, P3 are called the momentum operators of the quantum
ﬁeld. We postulate that the spectral points p0, p1, p2, p3 of the operators
P0, P1, P2, P3, respectively, lie in the following forward cone:
p2
0 −
3

j=1
p2
j ≥0,
p0 ≥0.
We also postulate that the energy of the ground state is equal to zero,
that is,
HΩ0 = 0.
Intuitively, the spectral points p0, p1, p2, p3 describe the possible energy
values E = p0 and the possible momentum vectors
p = p1e1 + p2e2 + p3e3
of the quantum ﬁeld. Here, pj := −pj for j = 1, 2, 3, and e1, e2, e3 is a
right-handed orthonormal system of vectors.
(GW3) The generalized quantum ﬁeld. There exists a linear map
f →ϕ[f]
(15.41)
which assigns a linear self-adjoint operator ϕ[f] on the Hilbert space
X to each test function f ∈S(RD). There exists a dense subset D of
the Hilbert space X such that the domain of deﬁnition of each operator
ϕ[f] contains the set D. The generalized quantum ﬁeld is relativistically
invariant. That is,
U(A, a)−1ϕ[f] U(A, a) = ϕ[f(A,a)]
for all elements (A, a) of the Poincar´e group. By deﬁnition, f(A,a)(x) is
equal to f(Ax + a) for all x ∈M4. Intuitively, think of
ϕ[f] :=

M4 ϕ(x)f(x) d4x
(15.42)
for all test function f ∈S(R4). Let us brieﬂy discuss this as a key point
to quantum ﬁeld theory. Naively, a quantum ﬁeld is an operator-valued
function
x →ϕ(x)
which assigns a self-adjoint operator ϕ(x) to each space-time point
x = (x, t). Unfortunately, this is a highly singular and ill-deﬁned mathe-
matical object. Therefore, we consider ﬁrst the integral ϕ[f] from (15.42)

15.6 Rigorous Perspectives
869
which is obtained by averaging over test functions f. This motivates the
more general deﬁnition where the generalized quantum ﬁeld (15.41) is a
tempered operator-valued distribution; the values ϕ[f] are operators on
the Hilbert space X.
(GW4) Density of standard states. The ground state Ω0 lies in D, and the
set of standard states
 N

k=1
ϕ[fk]

Ω0
for all N = 1, 2, . . . and all test functions f1, . . . , fN ∈S(R4) is dense in
the Hilbert space X. We say that the ground state Ω0 is a cyclic vector
of the Hilbert space X. Intuitively, the standard states correspond to
particle creation and particle annihilation.
(GW5) Locality of the generalized quantum ﬁeld. If the supports of the two
test functions f, g ∈S(R4) are space-like separated,34 then we have the
commutation property

ϕ[f] · ϕ[g] −ϕ[g] · ϕ[f]

θ = 0
for all
θ ∈D.
Intuitively, the events belonging to the supports of f and g cannot inﬂu-
ence each other by physical eﬀects. This locality property is a weak form
of causality.
In addition, we distinguish between the following two cases which are impor-
tant from the physical point of view.
• Uniqueness of the ground state: Up to a complex factor, the ground state
Ω0 is unique. Furthermore, the ground state Ω0 is relativistically invariant,
that is, for each element (A, a) of the Poincar´e group, there exists a complex
number λ with |λ| = 1 such that U(A, a)Ω0 = λΩ0.
• A phase transition of the quantum ﬁeld is possible: There are at least
two linearly independent ground states Ω0 and Ω1. Intuitively, by a phase
transition, we understand a passage from Ω0 to Ω1.
The model is called trivial if it behaves like a free model. Finally, the model
is called asymptotically free if it behaves like a free model as energy goes to
inﬁnity.
In what follows, we will also consider quantum ﬁelds on a D-dimensional
space-time where D = 2, 3, 4, . . . In this case, one has to modify the axioms
(GW1) through (GW5) above in a natural way. In particular, it is necessary
to use the D-dimensional Poincar´e group which consists of all the transfor-
mations
34 This means that if x ∈supp f and y ∈supp g, then

15. The Operator Approach
x′ = Ax + a,
x ∈RD
with arbitrary, but ﬁxed element a of RD, and a ﬁxed invertible (D × D)-
matrix A with the property
(Ax) · (Ax) = x · x
for all
x ∈Rd.
Here, we write x · y := x0y0 −D−1
k=1 xkyk.
15.6.2 The Euclidean Strategy in Constructive Quantum Field
Theory
The highly sophisticated mathematical task of constructive quantum ﬁeld
theory is to construct models which satisfy the G˚arding–Wightman axioms
and which are related to given classical action functionals. The Euclidean
strategy reads as follows.
Step 1: Start with a classical action functional. Pass over to the Euclidean
version of the action. Discretize the Euclidean action. Study the dis-
cretized model with the methods of statistical physics (e.g., study the
Ising model which is related to random walks).
Step 2: Carry out the continuum limit of the lattice model, by using estimates
based on correlation inequalities. Show that the continuum limit satisﬁes
the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms for the Euclidean correlation functions
C1, C2, . . . Use the Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction theorem in order
to construct the Wightman functions Wn, by analytic continuation with
respect to imaginary time. Intuitively,
Cn(x1, t1; . . . , xn, tn) = Wn(x1, it1; . . . , xn, itn)
for n = 2, 3, 4, . . .
Step 3: Prove that the Wightman functions (more precisely, the tempered
Wightman distributions) satisfy the Wightman axioms, and use the
Wightman reconstruction theorem in order to construct a model which
satisﬁes the G˚arding–Wightman axioms mentioned above. Intuitively, the
Wightman functions are given by
Wn(x1, t1; . . . ; xn, tn) := ⟨Ω0|ϕ(x1, t1) · · · ϕ(xn, tn)Ω0⟩.
That is, the Wightman functions are vacuum expectation values of prod-
ucts of quantum ﬁeld operators.
Step 4: Study the uniqueness of the ground state or the existence of phase
transitions between diﬀerent ground states.
Step 5 : Study the existence of bound states (e.g., by using the Bethe–
Salpeter equation), and the existence of scattering processes (e.g., by
using the Haag–Ruelle theory for the S-matrix).

15.6 Rigorous Perspectives
871
Examples. Let us consider some important examples which were studied
in fundamental papers by Glimm and Jaﬀe around 1970 and by their follow-
ers. As an introduction, we recommend the monographs by Simon (1974),
Glimm, Jaﬀe (1981), Grosse (1988), and Fern´andez, Fr¨ohlich, Sokal (1992).
In what follows suppose that the coupling constant κ > 0 is suﬃciently small.
Furthermore, we assume that the additional potential parameter vanishes,
λ := 0.
(i) The Minkowskian ϕ4
2-model: The G˚arding–Wightman axioms are ful-
ﬁlled.35
(ii) The Minkowskian ϕ4
3-model: The G˚arding–Wightman axioms are ful-
ﬁlled.
(iii) Triviality of the Euclidean ϕ4
D model with D > 4 : Roughly speaking,
the model behaves like a free model. This crucial fact was proven in-
dependently by Aizenman and Fr¨ohlich in 1982. Intuitively, this trivial
behavior depends on the fact that random walks do not intersect if the
dimension is larger than four.36
(iv) Triviality of the Euclidean ϕ4
4-model: Based on computer experiments
and partial rigorous results, most physicists expect that the ϕ4-model in
four-dimensional space-time has the surprising property of behaving like
a free model (after renormalization).

15.6.3 The Renormalization Group Method
In very rough terms, this modern method in renormalization theory goes as
follows. Let us consider the Euclidean ϕ4
4-model. Our goal is to construct the
Fourier transform of the renormalized Euclidean correlation functions
Cn,ren(p1, . . . , pn) =
∞

m=0
C(m)
n,ren(p1, . . . , pn)κm,
n = 1, 2, . . .
as a formal power series expansion with respect to the coupling constant κ.
Here, the momenta p1, . . . , pn lie in R4. Moreover, p1 +. . .+pn = 0. The idea
is to use a limit of the form
C(m)
n,ren(p1, . . . , pn) = lim C(m)
n,Pmax,Pmin(p1, . . . , pn)
(15.43)
where
• Pmax →+∞(high-energy limit or ultraviolet limit), and
• Pmin →+0 (low-energy limit or infrared limit).
To this end, we ﬁx two positive numbers Pmax and Pmin, and we only consider
momenta p1, . . . , pn−1 ∈R4 which satisfy the following inequality
0 < P 2

15.6 Rigorous Perspectives

We call this a cut-oﬀin momentum space. Naively, correlation functions
are given by functional integrals. Motivated by this, we use the following
ingredients.
(i) Finite functional integrals: We construct the approximation
C(m)
n,Pmax,Pmin(p1, . . . , pn)
by using suitable functional integrals on a lattice. The deﬁnition of the
approximate functional integrals is motivated by physical arguments: in
terms of the language of Feynman diagrams, the internal lines correspond
to the truncated Euclidean propagator


e−(p2+m2
0)/P 2

min

,
whereas the vertices of the Feynman diagrams are determined by the
Lagrangian density of the interaction potential including counterterms.
(ii) The renormalization group equation: We postulate the validity of a ﬁrst-
order partial diﬀerential equation for
∂C(m)
n,Pmax,Pmin
∂Pmax
.
This is the so-called renormalization group equation which determines
a semi-ﬂow with respect to the ﬂow parameter Pmax. Intuitively, this
diﬀerential equation describes natural rescaling properties of correlation
functions under multiplicative renormalization.
(iii) Boundary conditions: We add boundary conditions to equation (ii) at the
points Pmin = 0 and Pmax. For example, these boundary conditions help
to ﬁx the counterterms. Therefore, they are also called renormalization
conditions.
The idea is to prove the convergence of (15.43) by using estimates coming
from an induction argument based on (ii) and (iii). An elegant proof can be
found in
C. Kopper, Renormalization with Flow Equations (in German), Shaker,
Aachen, 1998, pp. 18–21.
This proof avoids the use of huge, but redundant Feynman diagrams. For the
dimensions D = 2, 3, 4, a detailed study of the ϕ4
D-model is contained in the
book by
M. Salmhofer, Renormalization: An Introduction, Springer, Berlin, 1999,
along with a discussion of the relation to Feynman diagrams.
The Polchinski equation. Finally, let us mention that the approach
sketched above dates back to the fundamental paper by

J. Polchinski, Renormalization and eﬀective Lagrangians, Nucl. Phys. B
231 (1984), 269–295.
The idea of Polchinski is to consider the space of Lagrangian densities of
the ϕ4
4-model including counterterms and cut-oﬀs in the momentum space.
The goal is to construct a semi-ﬂow in this space which starts with the bare
Lagrangian density and ends up with the renormalized Lagrangian density.
The ﬂow parameter is equal to Pmax, along with the high-energy limit
Pmax →+∞.
The basic trick is to obtain a partial diﬀerential equation called the semi-ﬂow
equation (or renormalization group equation) which governs the semi-ﬂow.
To this end, Polchinski uses the generating functional
Z(J; Pmax, Pmin)
for the correlation functions in the form of a functional integral, and he
postulates the validity of the so-called Polchinski equation
∂Z(J; Pmax, Pmin)
∂Pmax
= 0.
This elegantly yields the desired semi-ﬂow equation.37 Finally, Polchinski
simpliﬁes the semi-ﬂow equation by assuming that the low-energy behavior,
Pmin →+0, has a simple structure. The Polchinski approach avoids the
trouble with overlapping divergences in the integrals of the BPHZ approach
to renormalization. The ingenious idea of considering semi-ﬂows in the space
of physical theories (i.e., the space of Lagrangian densities) is due to Wilson.

16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
The interactions between elementary particles in the Standard Model are
described by gauge ﬁeld theories.
Folklore
16.1 Basic Diﬃculties
Observe the crucial fact that both quantum electrodynamics and the Stan-
dard Model in particle physics are gauge ﬁeld theories. This means that
• the interacting particles (photons, gluons, and vector bosons) are described
by gauge potentials which are only determined up to local gauge transfor-
mations, and
• the Lagrangian density is invariant under local gauge transformations.
The typical diﬃculty is that the original response equations are not uniquely
solvable because of the local gauge invariance.
In order to get uniquely solvable response equations, one has to ﬁx
the choice of the gauge potentials by adding side conditions.
This leads to additional terms in the Lagrangian density which enter the re-
sponse equations. This is called gauge ﬁxing. The response equations depend
on the gauge ﬁxing. We now proceed as follows.
• We ﬁx the response equations by ﬁxing the side conditions (gauge ﬁxing),
• and we apply the universal approach to this special situation.
However, this approach only works well if the following two conditions are
fulﬁlled:
(G) Gauge invariance: The physics does not depend on the choice of the
gauge ﬁxing.
(S) Unitarity condition: The S-matrix is unitary.
If the unitarity condition is violated, then the elements of the S-matrix cannot
be interpreted as transition probabilities. To guarantee condition (S) in gen-
eral gauge ﬁeld theories, one has to introduce additional ghost and antighost
ﬁelds (see Sect. 16.6).

878
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
The general strategy. In the classical calculus of variations, constrained
problems are treated by means of Lagrange multipliers (see Sect. 7.28). Physi-
cists have developed several methods in order to generalize the method of
Lagrange multipliers to gauge ﬁeld theories. The main idea is to introduce
additional quantities called Lagrange multipliers in mathematics; in physics
one speaks of ghosts, antighosts, and antiﬁelds. In the next sections, we will
sketch the basic ideas related to
• the Faddeev–Popov–De Witt ghost formalism,
• the Becchi–Rouet–Stora–Tyutin (BRST) ghost formalism, and
• the Batalin–Vilkovisky antiﬁeld formalism based on a master equation.
Summarizing, the basic ideas behind all of these formalisms read as follows:
• In order to compute physical processes in gauge ﬁeld theories, the simplest
way is to ﬁx the gauge potential by specifying a special gauge condition.
Then, one has to show that all of the computations including renormaliza-
tion via counterterms are independent of the choice of the gauge.
• To guarantee the unitarity of the S-matrix and hence the consistency of
transition probabilities for scattering processes, one has to introduce ad-
ditional ﬁelds (Lagrangian multipliers) that are called ghosts, antighosts,
or antiﬁelds. It is crucial that these additional ﬁelds do not appear as
real incoming or outgoing particles in scattering processes. This is a con-
sequence of cancellations governed by an additional symmetry related to
BRST symmetry or its generalizations.
We will discuss below that
Ghosts are closely related to the fundamental concept of cohomology
in mathematics.
As we will show in Volume II on the Gupta–Bleuler formalism in quantum
electrodynamics, real physical photons are polarized transversally; in contrast
to this, ghosts correspond to photons which possess an unphysical longitudi-
nal polarization. The formalisms mentioned above represent generalizations
of the Gupta–Bleuler formalism.
System of units. In this chapter, we use the energetic system of units
with ℏ= c = 1.
16.2 The Principle of Critical Action
We want to discuss the basic ideas of generalizing quantum electrodynam-
ics to gauge theories having non-commutative gauge groups. The Standard
Model in particle physics is of this type. In what follows, let x ∈M4, and
choose µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 along with the notation introduced on page 768. We
will use

• a matter ﬁeld ψ (fundamental particles), and
• a gauge ﬁeld F (gauge bosons).
The fundamental particles are fermions (e.g., electrons or quarks). The gauge
bosons are responsible for the interaction between the fundamental particles
(e.g., photons or gluons). The gauge ﬁeld F has a potential A called gauge
potential. Diﬀerent choices of the potential A correspond to gauge transfor-
mations.
The theory has to be designed in such a way that it is invariant under
gauge transformations.
This is called the gauge invariance principle
Prototype 1: Quantum electrodynamics with the commutative gauge
group G = U(1) and the gauge Lie algebra u(1). In quantum electrodynamics,
the matter ﬁeld ψ describes electrons, whereas the gauge ﬁeld F corresponds
to photons (electromagnetic ﬁeld).1 The covariant derivative reads as
∇µ := ∂µ −ieAµ,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3
where the real valued functions A0, A1, A2, A3 represent the 4-potential of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld which is given by
Fµν := ∂µAν −∂νAµ,
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
If we set
Aµ := −ieAµ,
Fµν = −ieFµ,ν,
then the following hold true for all µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
• Aµ ∈u(1),
• ∇µ = ∂µ + Aµ,
• Fµν = ∇µ∇ν −∇ν∇µ,
• κ = e (coupling constant),
• Dirac equation: iγµ∇µψ = meψ (me bare rest mass of the electron).
Here, −e is the bare electric charge of the electron. Note that the bare mass
and the bare charge of the electron are used in order to construct the crucial
renormalized (eﬀective) masses and charges of the electron which can be
measured in physical experiments. To this end, one uses the sophisticated
methods of renormalization theory. The complex (4×4)-matrices γ0, γ1, γ2, γ3
1 Recall that the Lie group U(1) consists of all complex numbers z with |z| = 1,
and the Lie algebra u(1) consists of all purely imaginary numbers αi where α is
a real number.
For N = 2, 3, . . ., the Lie group SU(N) consists of all complex (N × N)-matrices
U with det U = 1 and U −1 = U † (special unitary group). Moreover, the corre-
sponding Lie algebra su(N) consists of all complex (N × N)-matrices A with
A = −A† and vanishing trace, tr(A) = 0.

are the Dirac–Pauli matrices from page 789. Our goal is to replace U(1) by
more general gauge groups.
Prototype 2: Quantum chromodynamics with the non-commutative
gauge group G = SU(3) and the gauge Lie algebra su(3). The reader should
have in mind the matter ﬁeld
ψ(x) =
⎛
⎜
⎝
ψ1(x)
ψ2(x)
ψ3(x)
⎞
⎟
⎠
of a quark. The components ψ1(x), ψ2(x), ψ3(x) are Dirac 4-spinors as in
Sect. 14.3 on page 789. They describe the three diﬀerent color charges of
the quark (red, green, and blue). The gauge bosons correspond to the ﬁeld
Fµν below. Parallel to quantum electrodynamics above, let us introduce the
following notions for all µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
• Aµ ∈su(3) (gluon potential)
• ∇µ = ∂µ + Aµ (covariant derivative),
• Fµν = ∇µ∇ν −∇ν∇µ (gluon ﬁeld tensor),
• Dirac equation: iγµ∇µψ = mψ (m bare rest mass of the quark).
Explicitly,
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + [Aµ, Aν]−,
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Recall that [Aµ, Aν]−:= AµAν −AνAµ. In contrast to quantum electrody-
namics, there arises the additional nonlinear term [Aµ, Aν]−which describes
self-interaction of the gluon ﬁeld. In order to get connect with the terminology
used in quantum electrodynamics, we introduce the rescaled gluon potential
Aµ and the rescaled gluon ﬁeld tensor Fµν by setting
Aµ = −iκAµ,
Fµν = −iκFµν
where κ > 0 is the coupling constant for the interaction between quarks and
gluons. This way, the Dirac equation reads as
iγµ(∂µ −iκAµ(x))ψ(x) = mψ(x),
x ∈M4.
(16.1)
Here, we set
Aµ(x)
⎛

ψ1(x)
ψ2(x)
ψ3(x)
⎞
⎟
⎠=
⎛

⎛
⎜
⎝
γµϕ1(x)
γµϕ2(x)
γµϕ3(x)
⎞

⎠.
Introducing Feynman’s dagger symbol ̸∇:= γµ∇µ, the Dirac equation (16.1)
can elegantly be written as

16.2 The Principle of Critical Action
881
(i ̸∇−m)ψ = 0.
The real Lie algebra su(3) possesses an 8-dimensional basis B1, . . . , B8. There-
fore,
Aµ(x) = κ(A1
µ(x)B1 + . . . + A8
µ(x)B8).
Set Bs := iBs. Then
Aµ(x) = A1
µ(x)B1 + . . . + A8
µ(x)B8.
Consequently, the gluon potential can be described by the following eight real
four-potentials
As
0(x), As
1(x), As
2(x), As
3(x),
s = 1, . . . , 8,
in contrast to one real four-potential for the photon in quantum electrody-
namics.
This explains why there are eight gluons in quantum chromodynam-
ics.
Equation (16.1) does not fully describe the self-interactions of the quark-
gluon ﬁeld (ψ, A). For formulating the ﬁnal theory, we will use the principle
of critical action along with the Lagrangian density (16.2) below. Let us now
discuss this.
The SU(N)-gauge ﬁeld model. We will proceed in the following steps.
Let N = 2, 3, . . . and µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(i) Gauge Lie group G. We choose the Lie group G := SU(N) as our gauge
group.
(ii) Gauge Lie algebra LG. The real Lie algebra su(N) to the Lie group
SU(N) is called the gauge Lie algebra LG corresponding to the gauge
group G. The dimension of su(N) is equal to S := N 2 −1.
(iii) Gauge potential A of gauge bosons (e.g., gluons):
A(x) = (A0(x), A1(x), A2(x), A3(x)).
The components Aµ(x) lie in the gauge Lie algebra su(N). In particular,
they are complex (N × N)-matrices, but not complex numbers of the
form Aµ(x) = −ieAµ(x), as in quantum electrodynamics.
(iv) Covariant derivative: ∇µ := ∂µ + Aµ.
(v) Field tensor F of gauge bosons: Fµν := ∇µ∇ν −∇ν∇µ. Hence,
Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ + [Aµ, Aν]−.

882
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
(vi) Rescaling: In order to get connect with the notation used in quantum
electrodynamics, we introduce the rescaled gauge potential Aµ and the
rescaled ﬁeld tensor Fµν by setting
Aµ = −iκAµ,
Fµν = −iκFµν.
This implies ∇µ = ∂µ −iκAµ and
Fµν(x) := ∂µAν(x) −∂νAµ(x) −iκ [Aµ(x), Aν(x)]−.
The constant κ > 0 is called the coupling constant. The rescaled ﬁeld
tensor Fµν describes particles which are responsible for the interaction
between fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons).
(vii) Gauge transformation: For all x ∈M4 and µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
Ag
µ(x) = G(x)Aµ(x)G(x)−1 −∂µG(x) · G(x)−1,
where G(x) ∈G. Explicitly,
G(x) = exp
 S

s=1
θs(x)Bs

.
Here, B1, . . . , BS is a basis of su(N), and we set θ = (θ1, . . . , θS) with
real components θs. In order to indicate the dependence of the gauge
transformation on the function θ, we also write Aθ instead of Ag. For the
rescaled gauge potential, the gauge transformation reads as
Ag
µ(x) = G(x)Aµ(x)G(x)−1 −i
κ ∂µG(x) · G(x)−1.
(viii) Matter ﬁeld ψ: The ﬁeld
ψ(x) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ψ1(x)
...
ψN(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
has N so-called color components. The index c = 1, . . . , N of ψc is called
color index. Each color component ψc is a Dirac 4-spinor, that is,
ψc(x) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
ψ1
c(x)
...
ψ4
c(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠,
c = 1, . . . , N
where each ψk
c (x) is a complex number. Using the complex (4×4)-Dirac–
Pauli matrices γ0, γ1, γ2, γ3 from Sect. 14.3, we set ψc(x) := ψc(x)†γ0
along with ψ(x) := (ψ1(x), . . . , ψN(x)).

16.2 The Principle of Critical Action

(ix) Source functional:
J[A, ψ] :=

M4 {tr(Aµ(x)Jµ(x)) + J (x)ψ(x) + ψ(x)J (x)} d4x.
Here, we assume that iJµ(x) ∈su(N) for all µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and x ∈M4.
(x) Total action:
S[A, ψ] :=

M4 L(A(x), ∂A(x), ψ(x), ∂ψ(x)) d4x.
Here we use the Lagrangian density
L := Lgauge boson + Lmatter + Lgauge ﬁxing + Lghost
(16.2)
along with the following expressions:2
• Lgauge boson := −1
4 tr(FµνF µν),
• Lmatter := ψ(i ̸∇−m)ψ,
• Lgauge ﬁxing :=
1
2ξ tr(∂µAµ · ∂νAν),
• Lghost := −ζd∂µ∇µη.
Fix the gauge parameter ξ > 0. Both the components of the ghost ﬁeld
η(x) =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
η1(x)
...
ηS(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
and the components of the antighost ﬁeld ζ(x)d = (ζ1(x), . . . , ζS(x)) are
Grassmann variables which satisfy the anticommuation relations (16.4)
on page 890.
Relation to modern diﬀerential geometry. In Volume III on gauge
theory, we will relate this gauge ﬁeld approach to the language of modern
diﬀerential geometry. In this geometric setting, the following hold true.
• The gauge ﬁeld tensor F represents the curvature of a principal ﬁber bundle
P = M4 × G over the space-time manifold M4 with structure group G.
• The gauge potential A is the corresponding connection which describes the
parallel transport in the principal ﬁber bundle P, and which generates the
covariant derivative ∇.
• The matter ﬁeld ψ is the section of a vector bundle V which is associated
to the principal ﬁber bundle P.
• The gauge transformations correspond to the changing of bundle charts.

Coordinates. We want to reformulate the theory above in terms of a basis
B1, . . . , BS of the real gauge Lie algebra su(N). For the gauge potential,
Aµ = κ
S

s=1
As
µ(x)Bs,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
In order to simplify notation, we will use the following Einstein summation
convention: We sum over Latin (resp. Greek) indices from 1 to S (resp. from
0 to 3). For example, we will brieﬂy write
Aµ(x) = κAs
µ(x)Bs,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
The components As
µ(x) are real numbers for all indices µ, s and all space-time
points x ∈M4. Therefore, the theory corresponds to S real four-potentials
As
0(x), As
1(x), As
2(x), As
3(x),
s = 1, . . . , S
which describe S gauge bosons. The commutation relations for the basis
elements B1, . . . , BS of the Lie algebra su(N) read as
[Ba, Bb]−= cs
abBs,
a, b = 1, . . . , S.
The real numbers cs
ab are called the structure constants of the Lie algebra
su(N). In particular, cs
ab = −cs
ba for a, b, s = 1, . . . S. It turns out that the
structure constants know all about the Lie algebra and about the local struc-
ture of the corresponding Lie group.
Observe that most physicists do not use Lie algebras in the sense of
mathematics, but they use a slight modiﬁcation.
The reason for this is the fact that the elements B of the Lie algebra su(N)
are skew-adjoint matrices. However, observables in quantum theory are self-
adjoint matrices. Therefore, physicists pass from B to B := iB. Motivated by
this, physicists do not use the basis B1, . . . BS of the Lie algebra su(N), but
they introduce the self-adjoint matrices
Bs := iBs,
s = 1, . . . , S.
We then get the commutation relations
[Ba, Bb]−= ics
abBs,
a, b = 1, . . . , S.
Here, [Ba, Bb]−= BaBb −BbBa is a modiﬁed Lie product, since Ba, Bb do
not lie in the Lie algebra su(N), but in i ⊗su(N).

16.3 The Language of Physicists
885
To simplify computations, it is important that the matrices B1, . . . , BS
can be chosen in such a way that3
tr(BsBr) = δrs,
s, r = 1, . . . , S.
We will also write δrs instead of δrs, and we will use the Kronecker symbols
δrs and δrs in order to lower and lift Latin indices, respectively. For example,
Bs := δsrBr. Using the matrices B1, . . . , BS, we write the rescaled gauge
potential as
Aµ(x) = As
µ(x)Bs,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
For the rescaled gauge ﬁeld tensor Fµν(x) = F s
µν(x)Bs, we get
F s
µν(x) = ∂µAν(x) −∂νAµ(x) + κcs
abAa
µAb
ν(x),
s = 1, . . . , S.
This means that the strength of the ﬁeld tensor components F s
µν depends on
the structure constants cs
ab of the gauge Lie algebra su(N). Setting ψ = 0,
the source functional reads as
J[A, 0] :=

M4 Jµ
s (x)As
µ(x)d4x
where Jµ(x) = Js
µ(x)Bs, and Jµ
s (x) := ηµνδsrJr
ν(x). The Lagrangian density
reads as
• Lgauge boson := −1

3 This follows from a general theorem telling us that the negative Killing form of
the Lie algebra LG to a compact semisimple Lie group G represents an inner
product on the Lie algebra LG. For the proof, see Simon (1996), p. 171. In the
special case of the Lie algebra su(2), note that the Pauli matrices σ1, σ2, σ3 from
page 789 satisfy the commutation relations
[σ1, σ2]−= 2iσ3,
[σ2, σ3]−= 2iσ1,
[σ3, σ1]−= 2iσ2.
Furthermore, we have the following anticommutation relations
σrσs + σsσr = 2δrs,
r, s = 1, 2, 3
which imply tr(σrσs) = 2δrs. Therefore, we choose Bs = Bs :=
1
√
2 σs, s = 1, 2, 3.

886
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
The choice ξ := 1 (resp. ξ := 0) is called the Feynman gauge (resp. the
Landau gauge). An elegant approach to the response function can be based
on computing a functional integral.
In terms of the operator approach to quantum ﬁeld theory, the quantized
ﬁelds As
µ(x) are operators, and we get the following vacuum expectation
values for time-ordered products of interacting quantum ﬁelds:
⟨0int|T {Ar
µ(x)As
ν(y)}|0int⟩= Grs
µν(x −y).
These functions are also called the full 2-point correlation functions of the
gauge bosons (or the full 2-point Green’s functions/or the gauge boson prop-
agators). A detailed study along with interesting applications to elementary
particles can be found in Volume V on the physics of the Standard Model.
For a list of standard references, we refer to page 908.
If we replace the gauge Lie group SU(N) (resp. the gauge Lie algebra
su(N) by U(1) (resp. u(1)), then our model passes over to quantum electro-
dynamics.
16.4 The Importance of the Higgs Particle
The Lagrangian density L above does not contain a quadratic term with
respect to the gauge potential A. Such a missing term tells us that the gauge
bosons are massless. However, this contradicts experimental experience. In
1967 Weinberg solved this problem by introducing an additional ﬁeld called
Higgs ﬁeld.4 This ﬁeld is responsible for the huge masses of the three gauge
bosons W +, W −, Z0 in electroweak interaction (nearly 90 proton masses).
The Higgs mechanism will be studied in Volume III on gauge theory. This
mechanism is closely related to the theory of phase transitions in solid state
physics.
16.5 Integration over Orbit Spaces
Count equivalent physical states only once.
Folklore
The Feynman functional integral sums over all possible physical states. Here,
it is crucial that equivalent physical states are counted only once. Therefore,
in the case where symmetries are present, one has to sum over the orbits of
the symmetry group, but not on the single points of the orbit. This is the
basic idea behind the Faddeev–Popov–De Witt ghost approach. To explain
this, let us start with a simple example from classical calculus.

Prototype of orbit summation. Using rotation symmetry, we want to

to a one-dimensional integral. Observe that the integrand is invariant under
the rotation
x′ = x cos θ + y sin θ,
y′ = y cos θ −x sin θ
of the (x, y)-coordinate system pictured in Fig. 16.1(a). These rotations about
the origin are called gauge transformations; they form the group SO(2). If
we apply all possible rotations to a given point, say (x, 0), then we obtain
the orbit Ox. We regard the points of each orbit as equivalent points.
It is our goal to simplify the given integral J by eliminating the con-
tributions coming from equivalent points.
To this end, we will proceed in two steps.

(ii) General gauge ﬁxing (Fig. 16.1(b)): Now ﬁx the angle θ. Introduce the
function
y′ = f(x, y, θ) := y cos θ −x sin θ.
The equation
f(x, y, θ) = 0
is called the gauge condition; it determines the x′-axis. We claim that
J = π

R2 e−x2−y2 δ(f(x, y, θ)) |fθ(x, y, θ)| dxdy.
(16.3)
This is the prototype of the magic Faddeev–Popov formula. Let us justify
this in a formal way. Observe ﬁrst that the partial derivative reads as
fθ(x, y, θ) = −y sin θ −x cos θ = −x′. By (i),
J = π

R2 e−x′2−y′2δ(y′)|x′| dx′dy′.
Transforming this into the variables x, y and observing that
x′2 + y′2 = x2 + y2,
∂(x′, y′)
∂(x, y) = 1,
we get J = π

R2 e−x2−y2 δ(y′)|x′| dxdy. This is the claim (16.3).
16.6 The Magic Faddeev–Popov Formula and Ghosts
Gauge theory. We now consider the generating functional of a gauge theory
model
Z(J) :=

eiS[A]+iJ[A] DA
with the action functional
S[A] :=

M4 L(A(x), ∂A(x))d4x
and the source functional J[A] :=

M4 Jµ
s (x)As
µ(x)d4x. We use the same no-
tation as in Sect. 16.2. In particular, the gauge ﬁeld A = A(x) has four
components A0(x), A1(x), A2(x), A3(x) depending on the space-time point
x ∈M4. Each component Aµ(x) lies in the S-dimensional real Lie matrix
algebra LG which is related to the Lie matrix group6 G. The gauge transfor-
mations look like
6 For example, G = SU(N) and LG = su(N) with N = 2, 3, . . .. Then S = N 2 −1.

for all µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and x ∈M4. Here, G(x) ∈G for all x. Explicitly,
G(x) = exp

s=1
θs(x)Bs

where B1, . . . , BS is a basis of the gauge Lie algebra LG. Since the gauge
group element G(x) depends on the real functions θ1(x), . . . , θS(x), we write
Aθ instead of Ag. We regard the gauge potential A(x) and the transformed
gauge potential Aθ(x) as physically equivalent quantities. It is crucial that
The generating functional has to count equivalent gauge ﬁeld quanti-
ties only once. Therefore, we have to modify the generating functional
Z(J).
In 1967 Faddeev and Popov proposed the following modiﬁcation. The key
formulas read as follows:7
(i) Gauge condition:8 f(A(x)) = 0 for all x ∈M4.
(ii) The magic Faddeev–Popov formula:
ZFP(J) :=

eiS[A]+iJ[A] δ(f(A)) det
	δf(Aθ)
δθ

|θ=0
DA.
We replace the original generating functional Z(J) by the Faddeev–Popov
generating functional ZFP(J). The functional integral ZFP(J) is to be
understood as an inﬁnite-dimensional integral of the form
ZFP(J) =

eiS[A]+iJ[A] 
x∈M4
δ(f(A(x)) det
	δf(Aθ)
δθ(x)

|θ=0
dA(x)
with the continuum of integration variables A(x) indexed by the space-
time points x.
(iii) Ghosts: Motivated by the determinant trick for Grassmann variables
from Sect. 9.5 on page 518, Faddeev and Popov deﬁned the formal de-
terminant appearing in (ii) above by the formula
det
	δf(Aθ)
δθ(x)

|θ=0

7 As an introduction, we recommend Faddeev and Slavnov (1980), Peskin and
Schroeder (1995), and Ryder (1999). We will study this in Volume V on the
physics of the Standard Model in particle physics.
8 For example, f(A) := ∂µAµ. This is the so-called Lorentz gauge condition.

890
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
This determinant is called the Faddeev–Popov determinant. Here, we set
ζ(x)d := (ζ1(x), . . . , ζS(x)),
η(x) :=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
η1(x)
...
ηS(x)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
where η1(x), . . . , ηS(x) and ζ1(x), . . . , ζS(x) are Grassmann variables de-
pending on the parameter x. For all r, s = 1, . . . , S and all x ∈M4, we
postulate the following anticommutation relations:
ηr(x)ηs(x) = −ηs(x)ηr(x),
ζr(x)ζs(x) = −ζs(x)ζr(x),
ηr(x)ζs(x) + ζs(x)ηr(x) = δr
s.
(16.4)
This way, the additional ﬁelds η = η(x) and ζ = ζ(x) are introduced,
which are called ghost ﬁelds and antighost ﬁelds, respectively. The point
is that the additional ghost and antighost ﬁelds force the unitarity of the
S-matrix.
16.7 The BRST Symmetry
Historically, the Lagrangian density (16.2) above was obtained by Faddeev
and Popov in 1967. They used the Feynman functional integral in order to
derive the Feynman rules for scattering processes in gauge theory. 9 They in-
troduced ghosts and antighosts in order to cancel meaningless inﬁnite factors
in the generating functional written as functional integral. We will discuss this
in Sect. 16.6. From the physical point of view, the most important quantity
is the S-matrix.
The S-matrix has to be unitary.
Otherwise, the entries of the S-matrix cannot be interpreted as transition
probabilities (see Sect. 7.15 on page 370). The introduction of the Faddeev–
Popov ghosts and antighosts is a formal mathematical trick in order to change
the S-matrix in such a way that it becomes a unitary operator.
In 1974 Becchi, Rouet, Stora and independently Tyutin noticed that
ghosts and antighosts are related to a new kind of symmetry in quantum
ﬁeld theory that nowadays is called BRST symmetry.10 The idea is to re-
place the gauge ﬁxing Lagrangian density Lgaugeﬁxing from (16.2) by
LBRST := 1
2ξ tr(χ2) + tr(χ∂µAµ)

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
891
where the additional ﬁeld χ(x) = χs(x)Bs lives in the Lie algebra LG for each
space-time point x in M4. Therefore, the complete Lagrangian density reads
as
L = Lgaugeboson + Lmatter + LBRST + Lghost.
The point is that this Lagrangian density is invariant under the following
inﬁnitesimal transformations:
δAµ = εdAµ,
δψ = εdψ,
δη = εdη,
δζ = εdζ,
δχ = εdχ.
Explicitly, the BRST operator d is deﬁned in the following way:
dAµ : = ∇µη,
dψ := iκ(ηsBs)ψ,
dηs : = iκcs
abηaηb,
dζ := χ,
dχ := 0.
The precise meaning of inﬁnitesimal transformations is discussed in (7.69)
on page 410. The non-classical parameter ε anticommutes with all of the
ghost ﬁelds, antighost ﬁelds and fermionic matter ﬁelds. The point is that
the BRST operator d satisﬁes the relation11
d2 = 0.
The BRST symmetry will be studied in Volume V on the physics of the
Standard Model for elementary particles.
16.8 The Power of Cohomology
We want to show that the BRST symmetry is not an exotic mathematical
trick discovered by chance, but it is closely related to one of the deepest tools
in modern analysis, geometry, and topology called cohomology. Intuitively,
cohomology is rooted in
• the existence of potentials for physical ﬁelds,
• the integral theorems of Gauss, Green, and Stokes for physical ﬁelds,
• the Gauss–Bonnet theorem on the total curvature of two-dimensional sur-
faces and its generalization to higher dimensions by Chern,
• the theory of Abelian integrals and their Riemann surfaces,
• Poincar´e’s dual triangulations of polyhedra, the Betti numbers, and the
Euler characteristic,
• the theory of diﬀerential forms developed by ´Elie Cartan and Poincar´e at
the end of the 19th century and completed by de Rham in the 1930s (de
Rham cohomology),
11 We use the symbol d in order to emphasize the relation to cohomology theory in
mathematics. For historical reasons, physicists write Q instead of d.

892
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
• the Hodge theory for higher-dimensional Riemann manifolds from the
1930s,
• the Riemann–Roch–Hirzebruch theorem from the 1950s,
• the Atiyah–Singer index theorem from the 1960s,
• and the Ritz combination principle for atomic spectra.
This will be studied in Volume IV on quantum mathematics. In particular,
we will show there that cohomology is intimately related to electric circuits
(the Kirchhoﬀrules), the Maxwell equations in electrodynamics, and Dirac’s
magnetic monopoles. Indeed, the integration of the Maxwell equations via
four-potentials is cohomology in action. At this point, we restrict ourselves
to sketching a few basic ideas.
Poincar´e’s boundary operator ∂. In order to study the qualitative
(i.e., the topological) properties of geometric objects, Poincar´e considered
the equation
S = ∂B.
(16.5)
The set S is called the boundary of the set B. Moreover, a set C is called a
cycle iﬀit has no boundary. We write ∂C = 0. Typical cycles are circles and
spheres.
Poincar´e studied cycles modulo boundaries. That is, he studied cycles
by putting boundaries equal to zero.
This leads to the concept of homology group which was introduced by Emmy
Noether in the 1920s.12 For example, if B is a ball in 3-dimensional space,
then S = ∂B is a sphere, and S is a cycle, that is, ∂S = 0. Therefore, we get
the crucial relation
∂2B = 0.
It turns out that operators D with the typical property D2 = 0 appear quite
often in mathematics and physics. In such cases, one can apply the methods
of homological algebra which lead to deep results.13
´Elie Cartan’s coboundary operator d. As a further example, let us
consider the equation
ω = dµ
(16.6)
for diﬀerential forms ω and µ. We are given the ﬁeld ω, and we are looking
for a potential µ.14 The crucial Poincar´e lemma tells us that
12 Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912), Emmy Noether (1882–1935).
13 The classical standard text on homological algebra is the monograph by H. Car-
tan and S. Eilenberg, Homological Algebra, Princeton University Press, 1956.
We also recommend G. Bredon, Topology and Geometry, Springer, New York,
1993.
14 For a simple example, see equation (16.7) on page 895.

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
893
d2 = 0.
Motivated by the boundary operator above, the ﬁeld ω is called a cocycle iﬀ
dω = 0. Moreover, the cocycle ﬁeld ω is called trivial iﬀit is a coboundary,
that is, ω = dµ.
Cohomology theory studies cocycles modulo coboundaries. That is, it
studies cocycles by putting coboundaries equal to zero.
It turns out that there exists a crucial duality between homology and coho-
mology. In terms of physics, this duality relates the geometry of manifolds
(e.g., space-time manifolds) to the analytic structure of the physical ﬁelds on
manifolds (see Volume IV on quantum mathematics).
The BRST operator Q. In the BRST approach, physicists write Q
instead of d, and they use the operator Q in order to eliminate ghosts. Let
us discuss this.
16.8.1 Physical States, Unphysical States, and Cohomology
Use only essential physical states.
Folklore
Consider a linear space X over K = R (real space) or K = C (complex space).
Let Q : X →X be a linear operator which has the characteristic property
Q2 = 0.
The elements ω, µ, ϱ, . . . of X are called states. The operator Q allows us to
classify states in the following way:
(i) Physical state ω: The state ω is called a physical state iﬀQω = 0. Simi-
larly, a state ω is called an unphysical state (or a ghost) iﬀQω ̸= 0.
(ii) Trivial physical states ω: Each state of the form ω = Qµ for some state
µ is a physical state.15 Such states are called trivial physical states.
(iii) Equivalent physical states: Two physical states ω and ϱ are called equiv-
alent iﬀthe diﬀerence ω −ϱ is a trivial physical state. In other words,
ω ∼ϱ
iﬀ
ω = ϱ + Qµ
for some state µ.
This equivalence relation respects linear combinations. Explicitly, for
physical states ω, ω′, ϱ, ϱ′ and numbers α, β ∈K,16
ω ∼ω′, ϱ ∼ϱ′
implies
αω + βϱ ∼αω′ + βϱ′.
15 Note that Qω = Q2µ = 0.
16 In fact, if ω = ω′ +Qµ and ϱ = ϱ′ +Qσ, then αω +βϱ = αω′ +βϱ′ +Q(αµ+βσ).

894
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
(iv) Essential physical states [ω] : For each physical state ω, the symbol [ω]
denotes the set of all physical states which are equivalent to ω. In other
words,
[ω] := {ω + Qϱ : ϱ ∈X.}
The equivalence classes [ω] are called essential physical states.
(v) The essential state space X/Q : The space of all essential physical states
[ω] forms a linear space over K. This space is denoted by X/Q. The linear
combinations on X/Q are deﬁned by
α[ω] + β[ϱ] := [αω + βϱ]
for all physical states ω, ϱ and all α, β ∈K. This deﬁnition does not
depend on the choice of the representatives.17
In order to eliminate ghosts, we replace the original state space X by the
essential state space X/Q which is also called the cohomology space of X
with respect to the BRST operator Q. From the practical point of view, we
work with physical states by simply putting trivial physical states equal to
zero. For example, if ω, ϱ, σ are physical states and σ is a trivial physical
state, then
αω + βϱ + γσ = αω + βϱ
for all
α, β ∈K.
16.8.2 Forces and Potentials
The calculus of diﬀerential forms was introduced by ´Elie Cartan (1869–1951)
at the end of the 19th century. This is the most important tool in modern
analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. Let us discuss the basic ideas.
To this end, introduce the potential function U = U(x, y) and the force 1-form
F = a(x, y)dx + b(x, y)dy
on the Euclidean (x, y)-plane R2. Using the wedge product
dx ∧dx = dy ∧dy = 0,
dx ∧dy = −dy ∧dx,
we deﬁne the derivative of diﬀerential forms:
• dU := Uxdx + Uydy,
• da = axdx + aydy and db = bxdx + bydy;
• dF = da ∧dx + db ∧dy = cdx ∧dy where we set c := bx −ay;
• d(dU) = dUx ∧dy + dUy ∧dx = (Uyx −Uxy)dx ∧dy = 0;
• d(dF) = dc ∧dx ∧dy = cxdx ∧dx ∧dy + cydy ∧dx ∧dy = 0.
17 By (iii), if ω ∼ω′ and ϱ ∼ϱ′, then α[ω] + β[ϱ] = α[ω′] + β[ϱ′].

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
895
Hence d2 = 0. This is called the Poincar´e lemma. The key equation reads as
F = −dU
on Ω
(16.7)
where Ωis an open subset of R2. Explicitly,
a = −Ux,
b = −Uy
on Ω.
We are given the smooth force components a, b : Ω→R, and we are looking
for the smooth function U : Ω→R. Introducing the classical force vector
ﬁeld F(x, y) := a(x, y)i + b(x, y)j, equation (16.7) reads as
F = −grad U
on Ω.
In classical mechanics, the function U is called a potential of the given force
ﬁeld F.
Necessary solution condition. If equation (16.7) has a smooth solution
U : Ω→R, then dF = −d(dU) = 0. This means that curl F = 0 on Ω, in
the language of vector analysis.
Suﬃcient solution condition. The point is that the necessary solution
condition is not always a suﬃcient condition. Let us discuss two diﬀerent
situations.
(i) Choose Ω:= R2. Equation (16.7) has a smooth solution U : R2 →R iﬀ
curl F = 0 on R2. The general solution then reads as
U(x) = const −
 x
x0
F(y)dy,
x ∈R2.
(16.8)
This integral does not depend on the choice of the smooth path in Ω
from the ﬁxed initial point x0 to the ﬁnal point x. In terms of physics,
the integral
 x
x0 F(y)dy is the work done by the force ﬁeld F when moving
a particle from x0 to the point x.
(ii) Choose Ω:= R2 \ {0}. Since the force ﬁeld F may have a singularity
at the origin, the curve integral (16.8) may depend on the choice of the
path from x0 to x in Ω. In terms of physics, this means that the work
done by the force ﬁeld may be path-dependent. The precise result reads
as follows: Equation (16.7) has a smooth solution U : Ω→R iﬀboth the
local condition curl F = 0 on Ωand the global condition

S1 F(y)dy = 0
are satisﬁed. The general solution is then given by the path-independent
integral (16.8).
Let us reformulate this in terms of cocycles and coboundaries. First consider
the case where Ω:= R2 \ {0}.

896
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
• The force ﬁeld F is a cocycle iﬀdF = 0 on Ω. In terms of polar coordinates
ϕ, r, each cocycle can be represented as
F = dU + γdϕ
on Ω
where γ is a real number. Explicitly, 2πγ =

S1 F.
• The cocycle F is a coboundary iﬀγ = 0.
• The essential physical ﬁelds are cocycles by putting coboundaries equal to
zero. This yields
F = γdϕ,
γ ∈R.
Thus, the space H1(Ω) of essential 1-forms is isomorphic to R; we call
H1(Ω) the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group of Ω.
The situation changes completely for Ω= R2. Then, each cocycle F, that is,
dF = 0 on R2, can be represented as
F = dU
on R2.
The essential physical ﬁelds are cocycles by putting coboundaries equal to
zero. Hence F = 0. This corresponds to the trivial ﬁrst cohomology group,
H1(R2) = 0. Roughly speaking, cohomology theory yields the following gen-
eral result:
The topological complexity of a manifold Ωcan be measured by the
increasing number of independent physical ﬁelds on Ωthat have no
potential.
16.8.3 The Cohomology of Geometric Objects
Diﬀerential topology studies the qualitative structure of smooth geometric
objects by considering diﬀerential forms (physical ﬁelds) on manifolds. The
idea is to assign real linear spaces
Hk(M),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
to a compact manifold M. The space Hk(M) is called the kth cohomology
group of M. Furthermore, the dimension of Hk(M),
βk := dim Hk(M),
is called the kth Betti number of M. Finally, the number
χ(M) = β0 −β1 + β2 −. . .
is called the Euler characteristic of M.
The cohomology of the unit circle. We want to use the general scheme
from Sect. 16.8.1 in order to compute the de Rham cohomology algebra of

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
897
the unit circle. As usual in mathematics, we will write the symbol d instead
of Q. The points of the unit circle
S1 := {z ∈C : |z| = 1}
can be uniquely parametrized by the angle ϕ. Explicitly, we have z = eiϕ
where −π < ϕ ≤π. Let C∞
2π(R) denote the set of all smooth functions
f : R →R
which possess the period 2π. The smooth functions f : S1 →R can be
identiﬁed with the functions from C∞
2π(R).
(i) 0-cochains: The functions f from C∞
2π(R) are called the 0-chains of the
unit circle S1. We deﬁne df := f ′(ϕ)dϕ.
(ii) 1-cochains: The 1-forms g(ϕ)dϕ with g ∈C∞
2π(R) are called 1-cochains.
Using dϕ ∧dϕ = 0, we deﬁne d(gdϕ) := g′dϕ ∧dϕ = 0.
(iii) The Cartan algebra: The set of all diﬀerential forms
f + gdϕ,
f, g ∈C∞
2π(R).
forms the so-called Cartan algebra of the unit circle S1. There exist two
operations, namely, the sum and the wedge product. For example,
(f1 + g1dϕ) ∧(f2 + g2dϕ) = f1f2 + (f1g2 + g1f2)dϕ.
(iv) The de Rham cohomology algebra H(S1) of the unit circle: This algebra
consists of all the diﬀerential forms
α + βdϕ,
α, β ∈R.
This will be computed below.
(v) Betti numbers and the Euler characteristic of the unit circle: Let Hk(S1)
denote the linear subspace of all the diﬀerential forms of H(S1) of order
k = 0, 1, This is called the kth cohomology group of S1. Explicitly, the
ﬁrst cohomology group H1(S1) consists of all βdϕ with β ∈R, and H0(S1)
consists of all real numbers α. For the Betti numbers of the unit circle,
we get
βk := dim Hk(S1),
k = 0, 1.
Explicitly, β0 = β1 = 1. For the Euler characteristic of the unit circle,
we have
χ(S1) = β0 −β1 = 0.
Finally, let us compute H(S1). The key to this is the diﬀerential equation
f ′ = g,
f ∈C∞
2π(R)
(16.9)

898
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
for a given function g ∈C∞
2π(R). Integration of (16.9) yields
f(ϕ) = const +
 ϕ
0
g(θ)dθ.
(16.10)
This is a 2π-periodic function iﬀ
 2π
0
g(θ)dθ = 0.
(16.11)
Therefore, problem (16.9) has a solution iﬀcondition (16.11) is satisﬁed.
Then, the general solution is given by (16.10).
• The 0-form f is called a cocycle iﬀdf = 0. This means that f is constant.
• Each 1-form gdϕ is a cocycle, since d(gdϕ) = 0.
• The 1-form gdϕ is a coboundary iﬀthe equation
gdϕ = df,
f ∈C∞
2π(R)
has a solution. By (16.9), this is equivalent to (16.11).
• By deﬁnition, the cohomology algebra H(S1) consists of all cocycles
α + gdϕ
by putting coboundaries equal to zero. Let us write
α + gdϕ = α + (g −β)dϕ + βdϕ
with β :=
1
2π
 2π
0
g(θ)dθ. Hence
 2π
0
(g(θ) −β)dθ = 0.
Thus, (g −β)dϕ is a coboundary. Setting (g −β)dϕ = 0, we obtain that
α + gdϕ is equal to α + βdϕ. This is the claim from (iv) above.
The cohomology of the 2-dimensional unit sphere S2. It can be
shown that the de Rham cohomology algebra H(S2) of the unit sphere S2
consists of all the diﬀerential forms
α + γdϕ ∧dϑ,
α, γ ∈R
where ϕ and ϑ represent the geographic length and the geographic latitude
of the sphere, respectively. For example, the kth cohomology groups Hk(S2)
with k = 0, 1, 2 consist of
α with α ∈R;
0;
γdϕ ∧dϑ with γ ∈R,
respectively. This yields the Betti numbers βk := dim Hk(S2). Explicitly,
β0 = β2 = 1 and β1 = 0. For the Euler characteristic of the unit sphere, we
obtain

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
899
χ(S2) = β0 −β1 + β2 = 2.
Intuitive meaning of the Euler characteristic. We have computed
the Euler characteristic in terms of diﬀerential forms. An important result
of topology tells us that for compact ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds, the Euler
characteristic can be computed by means of triangulations or cell decompo-
sitions as in Sect. 5.6.2ﬀon page 242.
The cohomology of the 2-dimensional torus T2 := S1×S1. It can be
shown that the de Rham cohomology algebra H(T2) of the torus T2 consists
of all diﬀerential forms
α + β1dϕ + β2dϑ + γdϕ ∧dϑ,
α, β1, β2, γ ∈R.
Here, ϕ and ϑ represent the geographic length and the geographic latitude
of the torus, respectively. For example, the kth cohomology groups Hk(T2)
with k = 0, 1, 2 consist of
α with α ∈R;
β1dϕ + β2dϑ, β1, β2 ∈R;
γdϕ ∧dϑ, γ ∈R,
respectively. This yields the Betti numbers β0 = β2 = 1 and β1 = 2 along
with the Euler characteristic
χ(T2) := β0 −β1 −β2 = 0.
The following fact is crucial.
If we replace the unit circle, the unit sphere, and the torus above by
diﬀeomorphic manifolds, then the Betti numbers, and hence the Euler
characteristic remain unchanged.
16.8.4 The Spectra of Atoms and Cohomology
As a prototype, consider the hydrogen atom. By Bohr’s model, the electron
of the hydrogen atom attains the energy levels E1 < E2 < E3 < . . . If the
electron jumps from the upper level Em to the lower level En with m > n,
then a photon of energy
ℏωmn = Em −En
(16.12)
is emitted.18 Using
• the energy 0-cochain E := {E1, E2, . . .} and
• the frequency 1-cochain ω := {ωmn},
18 Recall that we are using the energetic system in this chapter. Thus, ℏ= 1.

900
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
the energy-frequency relation (16.12) can elegantly be written as
ℏω = dE.
This so-called Ritz combination principle tells us that the frequencies of a
radiating atom are not arbitrary, but there is a cohomological structure be-
hind them. Interestingly enough, this structure was used by Heisenberg in
order to establish quantum mechanics in 1925. This is one of the reasons why
cohomology plays a crucial role in quantum physics.
16.8.5 BRST Symmetry and the Cohomology of Lie Groups
As a further example, we want to show that the classical cohomology of Lie
groups is a special model of BRST symmetry. To this end, as in Sect. 16.2,
let us choose the gauge Lie group SU(N) with N = 2, 3, . . . and the corre-
sponding Lie algebra LG := su(N). In this setting, the following geometric
picture is behind BRST symmetry:
• antighosts are left-invariant velocity ﬁelds on the gauge group G;
• ghosts are dual objects to antighosts, that is, they are left-invariant cove-
locity ﬁelds on G;
• states are diﬀerential forms on G;
• the BRST operator Q coincides with the Cartan derivative d of states; this
implies d2 = 0;
• physical states are cocycles with respect to d;
• trivial physical states are coboundaries with respect to d;
• essential physical states are physical states by putting coboundaries equal
to zero; the essential physical states are also called the cohomology classes
with respect to d.
Let us sketch the basic ideas.19 Choose a ﬁxed basis B1, . . . , BS of the Lie
algebra LG. In what follows we will use the following Einstein summation
convention: We sum over equal upper and lower Latin indices from 1 to S.
For example, the equation
[Br, Bs]−= ck
rsBk,
r, s = 1, . . . , S
uniquely determines the real structure constants ck
rs of the Lie algebra LG.
(i) Temperature ﬁeld on the Lie group G. The symbol C∞(G, R) denotes the
set of all smooth functions
T : G →R.
For example, think of a temperature ﬁeld on the Lie group G.
19 A detailed study of the analysis on manifolds and Lie groups can be found in
Choquet–Bruhat et al. (1996), Vol. 1. We also refer to Zeidler (2000a), Vol. 2,
Chap. 16 (diﬀerential calculus on manifolds) and Chap. 17 (Lie groups and Lie
algebras).

16.8 The Power of Cohomology
901
(ii) Antighosts: For s = 1, . . . , S, deﬁne
vs(G) := GBs
for all
G ∈G.
Since t →GetBs is a curve on the Lie group G, and we have the time
derivative
vs(G) = d
dtGetBs|t=0,
the vector vs(G) is a velocity vector (or tangent vector) of the Lie group
G at the point G. Let I denote the unit element of G. Since
vs(G) = Gvs(I)
for all
G ∈G,
s = 1, . . . , S,
the velocity ﬁeld vs is called left-invariant. The left-invariant velocity
ﬁelds v1, . . . , vS are called antighosts.
Let the symbol V(G) denote the set of all smooth, left-invariant velocity
ﬁelds on the Lie group G. Each vector ﬁeld v ∈V(G) can be uniquely
represented as
v(G) = vs(G)vs(G)
for all points G ∈G. Here, the velocity components v1, . . . , vS lie in
the space C∞(G, R). The directional derivative of the temperature ﬁeld
T ∈C∞(G, R) at the point G with respect to the velocity ﬁeld vs is
deﬁned by
δT
δvs
(G) := d
dtT (GetBs)|t=0.
As usual, we write vs(T ) instead of the functional derivative
δT
δvs .
(iii) Ghosts: Fix v ∈V(G). For s = 1, . . . , S, deﬁne
θs(v1v1 + . . . + vSvS) := vs.
The linear mappings θ1, . . . , θS : V(G) →C∞(G, R) are called ghosts. In
particular, θs(vr) = δs
r for all r, s = 1, . . . , S.
(iv) Key relations for ghosts and antighosts: For all r, s = 1, . . . , S,
θrθs = −θsθr,
vrvs = −vsvr,
θsvr + vrθs = δr
s.
(16.13)
Let us explain this notation. For antighosts, we have the Lie product
[vr, vs](G) := G(v(I)w(I) −w(I)v(I)),
r, s = 1, . . . , S.
To simplify notation, we write vrvs instead of [vr, vs]. For ghosts, there
exists the wedge product
(θr ∧θs)(v, w) := θr(v)θs(w) −θr(w)θs(v)

902
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
for all v, w ∈V(G). We write brieﬂy θrθs instead of θr ∧θs. Finally, set
θrvs := θr(vs) = δr
s, and let vrθs denote the Lie derivative of θs with
respect to the velocity ﬁeld vr. Since θs is constant along the velocity
ﬁeld vr, we get
vrθs = 0,
s, r = 1, . . . , S.
This yields the last formula from (16.13).
(v) States: By deﬁnition, a state is a diﬀerential form
α + βsθs + γrsθrθs + µrstθrθsθt . . .
(16.14)
on the Lie group G. This is a polynomial in the variables θ1, θ2, . . . with
coeﬃcients α, βs, . . . in C∞(G, R). The products θrθs, θrθsθt, . . . are anti-
symmetric; that is, they change sign under a transposition of two factors.
(vi) The BRST operator d for ghosts: For each state θ, there exists the Cartan
derivative dθ, which can be computed in the following way:
• df := vs(f)θs if f ∈C∞(G, R).
• Maurer–Cartan structure equation:
dθs := −1
2cs
klθkθl.
(16.15)
• By the product rule, d(θrθs) = dθr · θs −dθs · θr. Similarly,
d(θrθsθk) = dθr · θsθk −dθs · θrθk + dθk · θrθs,
and so on.
• Again by the product rule, d(βsθs) = dβs · θs + βsdθs. Similarly,
d(γrsθrθs) = dγrs · θrθs + γrsd(θrθs),
and so on. It turns out that d(dθ) = 0 for all states θ. Brieﬂy,
d2 = 0.
(vii) The BRST operator d for antighosts: We deﬁne
dvs := vs −ck
srθrvk.
(16.16)
The point of this deﬁnition is that the operator d mixes ghosts and
antighosts.
(viii) Physical states: A state θ is called a physical state iﬀ
dθ = 0,
that is, θ is a cocycle. By (16.15), ghosts are not physical states.

16.9 The Batalin–Vilkovisky Formalism
903
(ix) The BRST transformation: Choose a parameter ε with ε2 = 0 and the
property that it anticommutes with ghosts and antighosts. By deﬁnition,
the inﬁnitesimal BRST transformation for ghosts and antighosts is given
by
δθs := εdθs,
δvs := εdvs,
s = 1, . . . , S.
Explicitly, δθs := −1
2εcs
klθkθl and δvs := ε(vs −ck
srθrvk).
(x) Cohomology groups Hk(G): By a physical k-state we mean a k-form θ
with dθ = 0. The physical k-states form the kth cohomology group of
the Lie group G by putting coboundaries equal to zero, that is, if µ = dϱ,
then µ = 0.
Generalization via representation of the Lie algebra LG. The ap-
proach considered above can easily be generalized by passing to states with
values in the Lie algebra LG or, more generally, with values in a representa-
tion of LG.
(i) By a state with values in the Lie algebra LG, we mean a symbol of the
form
ωs ⊗Bs
where ω1, . . . ωS are diﬀerential forms on the Lie group G as introduced
in (16.14) above. The BRST operator d is deﬁned by
d(ωs ⊗Bs) := dωs ⊗Bs.
The Lie product of such states is deﬁned by
[ωs ⊗Bs, µr ⊗Br] := (ωs ∧µr) ⊗[Br, Bs].
(ii) Let ϱ : LG →L be a Lie algebra morphism into the Lie algebra L. By
a state with values in the Lie algebra ϱ(LG), we mean a symbol of the
form
ωs ⊗ϱ(Bs).
In general, we replace Bs in (i) by ϱ(Bs).
The goal of each BRST theory is to show that the S-matrix is unitary and the
theory is ghost-free; that is, ghosts are never physical states. Applications of
the BRST quantization method to quantum ﬁeld theory and bosonic strings
can be found in Weinberg (1995), Vol. 2 and Jost (2001), respectively.
16.9 The Batalin–Vilkovisky Formalism
There exists a powerful general formalism for quantizing gauge ﬁeld theories
which is called the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism.20 This can be viewed as a

dent generators, Phys. Rev. 28D (1983), 2567–2582.
For a review, see J. Gomis, J. Paris, and S. Samuel, Phys. Rep. 295 (1995).

904
16. Peculiarities of Gauge Theories
far-reaching generalization of the Lagrange multiplier method. The idea is to
introduce additional ghost ﬁelds, antighost ﬁelds, and antiﬁelds to all kind of
ﬁelds. Furthermore, the original classical action functional S is replaced by
the modiﬁed action functional
S + S1.
Here, the additional term S1 depends on all kind of ﬁelds and antiﬁelds.
The key of the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism is the formulation of a master
equation for S + S1. This is a functional diﬀerential equation which is the
consequence of a generalized BRST symmetry. The functional derivatives of
S + S1 in the master equation refer to both ﬁelds and antiﬁelds. Roughly
speaking, the master equation encodes crucial relations between ﬁelds and
antiﬁelds. These relations are important for
• an eﬀective renormalization procedure and
• for analyzing the violations of the symmetries of the action by quantum
eﬀects (anomalies).
As an introduction to this, we recommend Weinberg (1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 15.9.
The geometric meaning of the master equation was clariﬁed in the paper by
M. Aleksandrov, M. Kontsevich, A. Schwarz, and O. Zaboronsky, Geome-
try of the master equation, Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 12 (1997), 1405–1430.
In modern literature, one calls this the AKSZ master equation.
16.10 A Glance at Quantum Symmetries
Symmetries play a crucial role in the process of quantizing classical theories.
For example, the symmetry properties of functional integrals are very useful
for studying quantum ﬁelds:
• The invariance of functional integrals under gauge transformations leads
to identities for the Green’s functions called the Ward–Takehashi identities
and the Taylor–Slavnov identities.
• It is possible that the functional integral related to the action of a classical
ﬁeld theory does not possess all the symmetry properties of the classical
theory. This leads to the so-called anomalies.
We will study this in Volume V on the physics of the Standard Model. We
recommend the following monographs:

and algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory are:

• the theory of complex-valued analytic functions of several variables, and

17.5 The Monster Group, Vertex Algebras, and Physics
The ﬁnite Monster group brings together modern algebra and conformal
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore

920
17. A Panorama of the Literature
The study of scattering processes for strings leads to fascinating mathemat-
ical structures like moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, K¨ahler manifolds,
Calabi–Yau manifolds, spectral geometry, zeta functions, Fock spaces, su-
per Lie algebras, Kac–Moody algebras, Heisenberg algebras, Virasoro al-
gebras, vertex operator algebras, modular forms, Hodge invariants and
mirror symmetry. This culminates in conformal quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
The ﬁnite Monster group. As an example of the interplay between mathe-
matics and modern physics, let us brieﬂy discuss the monster group. Symme-
tries in nature are described by groups. There arises the problem of classifying
all possible symmetries (i.e., all possible groups). This problem is solved for
(i) all crystal symmetries,
(ii) all simple, simply connected, compact Lie groups,2 and
(iii) all ﬁnite simple groups.
A group G is called simple iﬀit has only trivial realizations. This means that
each group epimorphism χ : G →H is an isomorphism or H consists only of
the unit element. The study of ﬁnite groups dates back to
• the work of Gauss (1777–1855) on cyclotomic ﬁelds in 1796 (the construction of
the regular 17-polygon with ruler and compass)
• and the work of Galois (1811–1832) on the solvability of algebraic equations in
1831.
Around 1980, problem (iii) above was ﬁnally solved by a large group of math-
ematicians. The full proof contains about ten thousand pages. See the survey
article by
• D. Gorenstein, Classifying the ﬁnite simple groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 14
(1986), 1–98.
It turns out that there exist
(a) 16 inﬁnite families of groups of Lie type (matrix groups over ﬁnite ﬁelds),
(b) the alternating groups of n letters with n ≥5, and
(c) 26 sporadic simple groups.
The largest ﬁnite simple sporadic group is called Monster; its number of
elements is equal to

The existence of the Monster was conjectured by Fischer and Griess in 1973.
Nine years later, Griess constructed the Monster group: .

The monstrous moonshine module. There arises the following ques-
tion:

particle physics are of this type. The classiﬁcation can be found in Simon (1996).

17.5 The Monster Group, Vertex Algebras, and Physics
921
Does the Monster group describe the symmetry of some mathematical
object?
This object is called monstrous moonshine. It turns out that the positive
answer to this question is closely related to appropriate models in string
theory of physicists. The highly sophisticated construction of the monstrous
moonshine module V as a vertex algebra can be found in
• I. Frenkel, J. Lepowski, and A. Meurman, Vertex Operator Algebras and the
Monster, Academic Press, New York, 1988.
The ﬁnal, very detailed answer about the action of the Monster group on V
was given by
• R. Borcherds, Monstrous moonshine and monstrous Lie super algebras, Invent.
Math. 109 (1992), 405–444.
Borcherds was awarded the Fields medal in 1998. Let us sketch the basic
ideas.
(M) The monstrous moonshine module V : There exists an inﬁnite direct sum
V =
∞
$
n=−1
Vn
of ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces V−1, V0, V1, ... such that the Monster
group M acts as symmetry group on V . This means that, for each element
g of the Monster group, there exists a linear isomorphism
L(g) : V →V
which respects multiplication; that is, L(gh) = L(g)L(h) for all g, h ∈
M. In addition, each operator L(g) leaves invariant all of the subspaces
V−1, V0, V1, ....
(D) The dimension of the invariant subspaces: If we introduce the generating
function
dim(q) :=
∞

n=−1
(dim Vn)qn,
then
dim(q) = j(τ) −744 = q−1 + 196 884q + 21 492 760q2 + ...
For example, this yields dim V−1 = 1, dim V0 = 0, and
dim V1 = 196 884.
The famous classical modular function j = j(τ) is deﬁned by

922
17. A Panorama of the Literature
j(τ) := (1 + 240 ∞
n=1 σ3(n))3
qΠ∞
n=1(1 −qn)24
for all complex numbers τ with ℑ(τ) > 0. Here, we set q := e2πτ, and
the function σ3(n) = 
d|n d3 is the sum of the cubes of the divisors of n.
As an introduction to the theory of modular forms, we recommend the
survey article by Zagier (1995).
(R) Irreducible representation: There exists a nonzero element v ∈V and a
decomposition
V1 = span{v} ⊕W
such that the monster group leaves the two linear subspaces span{v}
and W invariant. In addition, there does not exist any nontrivial linear
subspace of W which is invariant under the monster group. In other
words, the group of linear isomorphisms of W represents an irreducible
representation of the Monster group with dim W = 196 883.
(d) The characters of the monster representation: Let us introduce the Thom-
son series
Tg(q) :=
∞

n=−1
tr(L(g)|Vn)
where the symbol tr(L(g)|Vn) denotes the trace of the linear operator
L(g) on the linear space Vn. The numbers tr(L(g)|Vn) are called charac-
ters of the representation of the Monster group on Vn.3 In 1992 Borcherds
showed that, for any element g of the Monster group, the Thomson series
Tg(q) is a so-called Hauptmodule for a genus zero subgroup of the Lie
group SL(2, R).
Borcherds calculated this Thomson series by using the monster Lie algebra.
This Lie algebra is constructed as the space of physical states of a bosonic
string moving in a Z2-orbifold M/Z2 of a 26-dimensional torus M.
Vertex operator algebras. For the investigation of the monstrous
moonshine module V, it is crucial that this module carries an additional
structure: V is a vertex operator algebra (brieﬂy called vertex algebra). In
conformal quantum ﬁeld theory, vertex algebras are called chiral algebras by
physicists. This is related to superstring theory. As an introduction to vertex
algebras, we recommend:
• V. Kac, Vertex Algebras for Beginners, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, Rhode
Island, 1996.
• Xiaoping Xu, Introduction to Vertex Operator Superalgebras and Their Modules,
Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1998.
• I. Frenkel and D. Ben-Zvi, Vertex Algebras and Algebraic Curves, Amer. Math.
Soc., Providence, Rhode Island, 2001.
3 It is shown in representation theory that the irreducible representations of a
ﬁnite group are determined by the characters. See Simon (1996).

17.5 The Monster Group, Vertex Algebras, and Physics
923
A look at the history of string theory. In 1968, in an axiomatic way,
Veneziano formulated typical properties of the four-point scattering ampli-
tude of elementary particles in strong interaction.
• G. Veneziano, Construction of a crossing-symmetric, Regge-behaved amplitude
for linearly rising trajectories, Nuovo Cimento 57A (1968), 190–197.
He was looking for a function which satisﬁes his axioms, and he discovered
that the Euler beta function
B(x, y) =
 1
0
tx−1(1 −t)y−1dt,
x, y > 0
ﬁts the axioms well. He also introduced vertex operators as a technical tool
for describing scattering amplitudes at a vertex of the Feynman diagrams.
He used this in order to prove factorization properties of the amplitudes for
n scattered particles. In 1970 Nambu and other physicists realized that the
scattering amplitudes could be understood in terms of quantized relativistic
strings. Around 1973 it was discovered that string theory can incorporate
gravitation:
• T. Yoneya, Quantum gravity and the zero-slope limit of the generalized Virasoro
model, Nuovo Cimento Lett. 8 (1973), 951–955.
• J. Scherk and J. Schwarz, Dual models for non-hadrons, Nucl. Phys. B 81, 118–
144.
This was the birth of string theory as a candidate for a theory of all fun-
damental interactions in nature. In 1981 Polyakov applied the idea of the
Feynman functional integral to string theory.
• A. Polyakov, Quantum geometry of bosonic strings, Phys. Lett 103B (1981),
207–211.
He constructed a bridge to the classical mathematical theory of Riemann sur-
faces. In this setting, the states of a bosonic string are described by Riemann
surfaces. Since the Lagrangian of string theory is invariant under conformal
transformations, we have to assume that two Riemann surfaces represent the
same string state iﬀthey are conformally equivalent. Thus, the Feynman
functional integral has to be computed with respect to the conformal equiv-
alence classes of Riemann surfaces. In other words, one has to integrate over
Riemann’s classical moduli space. In 1984 Belevanin, Polyakov, and Zamolod-
chikov abstracted from string theory a general setting in terms of conformal
invariance.
• A. Belevanin, A. Polyakov, and A. Zamolodchikov, Inﬁnite conformal symmetries
in two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory, Nucl. Phys. B 241 (1984), 333–380.
This was the birth of conformal quantum ﬁeld theory. The nice properties
of conformal quantum ﬁeld theory rely on the rich structure of conformal
transformations in two dimensions, which lies at the heart of the classical

924
17. A Panorama of the Literature
theory of complex analytic functions. Nowadays string theory is a rich source
for getting beautiful new ideas in mathematics. The questions and conjec-
tures formulated by physicists are very stimulating for recent mathematical
research. Important contributions are due to Edward Witten, who says that
String theory is twenty-ﬁrst century physics that fell incidentially into
the twentieth century.
For the history of string theory, we recommend both the book by Brian
Greene (1999) (the two string revolutions) and the collection of important
papers in string theory edited by John Schwarz (1985).

topics:

• physical units, the Planck system, and the energetic system of units,
• the Gaussian system of units and the Heaviside system, and
• the method of dimensional analysis – a magic wand of physicists.
A comprehensive table on the units of the most important physical quantities can
be found at the end of the Appendix on page 951.
A.1 Notation
Sets and mappings. The abbreviation ‘iﬀ’ stands for ‘if and only if’. To formulate
deﬁnitions, we use the symbol ‘:=’. For example, we write
f(x) := x2
iﬀthe value f(x) of the function f at the point x is equal to x2, by deﬁnition.
The symbol U ⊆V (resp. U ⊂V ) means that U is a subset (resp. a proper
subset) of V . This convention resembles the symbols x ≤y (resp. x < y) for real
numbers. A map
f : X →Y
sends each point x living in the set X to an image point f(x) living in the set Y . The
set X is also called the domain of deﬁnition, dom(f), of the map f. By deﬁnition,
the image, im(f), of the map f is the set of all image points f(x). Furthermore,
the set
f(U) := {f(x) :
x ∈U}
is called the image of the set U by the map f. In other words, by deﬁnition, the set
f(U) contains precisely all the points f(x) with the property that x is an element
of the set U. The set
f −1(V ) := {x ∈X : f(x) ∈V }
is called the pre-image of the set V by the map f.
• The map f is called surjective iﬀeach point of the set Y is an image point. In
this case, we also say that f maps the set X ‘onto’ the set Y . The French word
‘sur’ means ‘onto’.
• The map f is called injective iﬀx1 ̸= x2 always implies f(x1) ̸= f(x2). Such
maps are also called ‘one-to-one’.

932
Appendix
• The map f is called bijective iﬀit is both surjective and injective. Precisely in
this case, the inverse map f −1 : Y →X exists.
For each given point y in the set Y , consider the equation
f(x) = y,
x ∈X,
(A.1)
that is, we are looking for a solution x in the set X. Observe that the map f
is surjective (resp. bijective) iﬀthe equation (A.1) has always at least one (resp.
precisely one) solution. The map f is injective iﬀthe equation has always at most
one solution.
Inverse map. If the map f : X →Y is bijective, then the inverse map
f −1 : Y →X
is deﬁned by f −1(y) := x iﬀf(x) = y.
Sets of numbers. The symbol K always stands either for the set R of real
numbers or the set C of complex numbers. The real number x is called positive,
negative , nonnegative, non-positive iﬀ
x > 0,
x < 0,
x ≥0,
x ≤0,
respectively. The symbols
R×,
R>,
R<,
R≥,
R≤
denote the set of nonzero real numbers, positive real numbers, negative real num-
bers, nonnegative real numbers, non-positive real numbers, respectively.5 Concern-
ing the sign of a real number, we write sgn(x) := 1, −1, 0 if x > 0, x < 0, x = 0,
respectively.
For a given complex number z = x+yi, we introduce both the conjugate complex
number z† := x −yi and the modulus
|z| :=
√
zz† =
p
x2 + y2.
The real (resp. imaginary) part of z is denoted by ℜ(z) := x (resp. ℑ(z) := y). The
deﬁnition of the principal argument, arg(z), of the complex number z can be found
on page 209. Traditionally,
• the symbol Z denotes the set of integers 0, ±1, ±2, . . . ,
• the symbol N denotes the set of nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, . . . (also called natural
numbers),6
• the symbol N× denotes the set of positive integers 1, 2, . . ., and
• the symbol Q denotes the set of rational numbers.
For closed, open, and half-open intervals, we use the notation
[a, b] := {x ∈R : a ≤x ≤b},
]a, b[:= {x ∈R : a < x < b},
and ]a, b] := {x ∈R : a < x ≤b}, as well as [a, b[:= {x ∈R : a ≤x < b}.
The Landau symbols. Around 1900 the following symbols were introduced
by the number theorist Edmund Landau (1877–1938). We write
5 For the closed half-line R≥, one also uses the symbol R+.
6 For the set N, one also uses the symbol Z≥.

A.1 Notation
933
f(x) = o(g(x))
as
x →a
iﬀf(x)/g(x) →0 as x →a. For example, x2 = o(x) as x →0. The symbol
f(x) = O(g(x))
as
x →a
(A.2)
tells us that |f(x)| ≤const |g(x)| in a suﬃciently small, open neighborhood of the
point x = a. For example, 2x = O(x) as x →0. We write
f(x) ≃g(x),
x →a
iﬀf(x)/g(x) →1 as x →a. For example,
sin x ≃x,
x →0.
Relativistic physics. In an inertial system, we set
x1 := x,
x2 := y,
x3 := z,
x0 := ct
where x, y, z are right-handed Cartesian coordinates, t is time, and c is the velocity
of light in a vacuum. Generally,
• Latin indices run from 1 to 3 (e.g., i, j = 1, 2, 3), and
• Greek indices run from 0 to 3 (e.g., µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3).
In particular, we use the Kronecker symbols
δij = δij = δi
j :=
(

if
i = j,
0
if
i ̸= j,
(A.3)

Einstein’s summation convention. In the Minkowski space-time, we always
sum over equal upper and lower Greek (resp. Latin) indices from 0 to 3 (resp. from
1 to 3). For example, for the position vector, we have
x = xjej :=
3
X
j=1
xjej,
where e1, e2, e3 are orthonormal basis vectors of a right-handed orthonormal sys-
tem. Moreover,
ηµνxν :=
3
X
ν=0
ηµνxν.
Greek indices are lowered and lifted with the help of the Minkowski symbols. That
is,
xµ := ηµνxν,
xµ = ηµνxν.
Hence
x0 = x0,
xj = −xj,
j = 1, 2, 3.

Appendix
For the indices α, β, γ, δ = 0, 1, 2, 3, we introduce the antisymmetric symbol ϵαβγδ
which is normalized by
ϵ0123 := 1,
(A.5)
and which changes sign if two indices are transposed. In particular, ϵαβγδ = 0 if
two indices coincide. For example, ϵ0213 = −1 and ϵ0113 = 0. Lowering of indices
yields ϵαβγδ := −ϵαβγδ. For example, ϵ0123 := −1.
The Minkowski metric. Unfortunately, there exist two diﬀerent conventions
in the literature, namely, the so-called west coast convention (W) which uses the
following Minkowski metric,
ηµνxµxν = c2t2 −x2 −y2 −z2,
(A.6)
and the east coast convention (E) based on −c2t2 + x2 + y2 + z2. (This refers to the
east and west coast of the United States of America.) From the mathematical point
of view, the east coast convention has the advantage that there does not occur any
sign change when passing from the Euclidean metric
x2 + y2 + z2
to the Minkowski metric. From the physical point of view, the west coast convention
has the advantage that the Minkowski square of the momentum-energy 4-vector
(p, E/c) is positive,
ηµνpµpν = E2
c2 −p2 = m2
0c2.
(A.7)
Here, m0 denotes the rest mass of the particle. Since most physicists and physics
textbooks use the west coast convention, we will follow this tradition, which dates
back to Einstein’s papers, Dirac’s 1930 monograph Foundations of Quantum Me-
chanics and Feynman’s papers. Concerning elementary particles, we use the same
terminology as in the standard textbook by Peskin and Schroeder (1995). One can
easily pass from our convention to the east coast convention by using the replace-
ments
ηµν →−ηµν,
γµ →−iγµ
for the Minkowski metric and the Dirac-Pauli matrices, γµ, from the Dirac equation
(A.20), respectively.7
A.2 The International System of Units
The ultimate goal of physicists is to measure physical quantities in physical exper-
iments. To this end, physicists have to compare the quantity under consideration
with appropriate standard quantities. For example, the measurement of the length
of a distance can be obtained by comparing the length with the standard length m
(meter). This procedure leads to systems of physical units.
The SI system. In the international system of units, SI (for Syst`eme Interna-
tional in French), the following basic units are used:
7 For example, the east coast convention is used in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
(1973) and in Weinberg (1995).

• length: m (meter),
• time: s (second),
• energy: J (Joule),
• electric charge: C (Coulomb),
• temperature: K (Kelvin).
Each physical quantity q can be uniquely represented as
q = qSI · mαsβJγCµKν.
(A.8)
Here, qSI is a real number, and the exponents α, β, γ, µ, ν are rational numbers.
Physicists say that the physical quantity q has the dimension
(length)α(time)β(energy)γ(electric charge)µ(temperature)ν.
Let us consider a few examples.
• The unit of mass is the kilogram, kg := Js2m−2.
• The unit of force is the Newton, N = Jm−1.
• The unit of electric current strength is the ampere, A := Cs−1.
The physical dimensions of the most important physical quantities in the SI system
can be found in Table A.4 on page 951. Instead of meter one also uses kilometer,
nanometer, femtometer, and so on, which corresponds to
1000m,
10−9m,
10−15m,
respectively (see Table A.1).
The universal character of the SI system. Unfortunately, for historical
reasons, there exist many diﬀerent systems of units used by physicists. In what
follows we want to help the reader to understand the relations between the diﬀerent
systems. Let us explain the following.
If one knows the physical dimension of some quantity in the SI system,
then one can easily pass to every other system used in physics.
In particular, we will discuss
• the natural SI system,
• the Planck system, and
• the energetic system.

936
Appendix
The Planck system has the advantage that the fundamental physical constants
G, ℏ, c, ε0, µ0, k do not appear explicitly in the basic equations (e.g., in elementary
particle physics and cosmology). In this system, all the physical quantities are
dimensionless.
The energetic system is mainly used in elementary particle physics. In this
system, all of the physical quantities are measured in powers of energy, and the
physical constants ℏ, c, ε0, µ0, k do not appear explicitly.
A.3 The Planck System
All the systems of units which have hitherto been employed owe their origin
to the coincidence of accidental circumstances, inasmuch as the choice of
the units lying at the base of every system has been made, not according to
general points of view, but essentially with reference to the special needs
of our terrestrial civilization. . .
In contrast with this it might be of interest to note that we have the means
of establishing units which are independent of special bodies or substances.
The means of determining the units of length, mass, and time are given
by the action constant h, together with the magnitude of the velocity of
propagation of light in a vacuum c, and that of the constant of gravitation
G. . . These quantities must be found always the same, when measured
by the most widely diﬀering intelligences according to the most widely
diﬀering methods.

Fundamental constants. There exist the following universal constants in nature:
• G (gravitational constant),
• c (velocity of light in a vacuum),
• h (Planck’s quantum of action),
• ε0 (electric ﬁeld constant of a vacuum),
• k (Boltzmann constant).
The explicit numerical values of these fundamental constants can be found in Table
A.3 on page 949. We also use the constants
• ℏ:= h/2π (reduced Planck’s quantum of action), and
• µ0 := 1/ε0c2 (magnetic ﬁeld constant of vacuum).
Basic laws in physics. These universal constants enter the following six basic
laws of physics.
(i) Einstein’s equivalence between rest mass m0 and rest energy E of a particle:
E = m0c2.
(ii) Energy E of a photon with frequency ν: E = hν.
(iii) Gravitational force F between two masses M1 and M2 at distance r:
F = GM1M2

By Table A.1 on preﬁxes, 1 MeV =106eV (mega electron volt).
Natural SI units. The ﬁve natural constants G, c, ℏ, ε0, and k can be used to
systematically replace the SI units m, s, J, C, K by the following so-called natural
SI units:
• Planck length: m := l :=
p
ℏG/c3,
• Planck time: s := l/c,
• Planck energy: J := ℏc/l,
• Planck charge: C := √cℏε0,
• Planck temperature: K := ℏc/kl.
Parallel to kg = Js2/m2, let us introduce the Planck mass
kg := Js2/m2 = ℏ/cl.
The numerical values can be found in Table A.2. From (A.8) we obtain the repre-
sentation
q = qPl · mαsβJγCµKν
(A.9)
of the physical quantity q in natural SI units. Hence

q = qPl · lα

Explicitly,
A = α + β −γ −ν,
B = γ + ν −β + µ/2,
C = γ + ν + µ/2,
and D = µ/2, E = −ν.
The Planck system of units. In this system, we set
l = c = ℏ= ε0 = k := 1.
In particular, for the gravitational constant, this implies G = 1. By (A.10), q = qPl.
The Planck system is characterized by the fact that all the physical quan-
tities are dimensionless and their numerical values coincide with the nu-
merical values in natural SI units.
In order to go back from the Planck system to the SI system, one has to replace
each physical quantity q by
q

(A.11)
according to (A.10). The corresponding exponents A, B, ... follow from (A.9) and
(A.10). These exponents can be found in Table A.4 on page 951.
Example 1. For the proton, we get
E = 0.77 · 10−19J = 1.5 · 10−10J = 0.938 GeV
(rest energy)
along with
M = E/c2 = 0.77 · 10−19kg = 1.67 · 10−27kg
(rest mass)
and
e =
√
4πα C = 0.30C = 1.6 · 10−19C
(electric charge).
Therefore, EPl = MPl = 0.77 · 10−19, and ePl = 0.30. In the Planck system, this
implies
E = M = 0.77 · 10−19
and
e = 0.30.
Example 2. Consider the Einstein relation
E = m0c2
(A.12)
between the rest mass m0 and the rest energy E of a free relativistic particle in the
SI system. Letting c := 1, we obtain the corresponding equation
E = m0
(A.13)
in the Planck system. Here, E = EPl and m0 = MPl. In order to go back from
(A.13) to the SI system, one has to observe that
E = EPl · J,
m0 = MPl · Js2m−2

A.3 The Planck System
939
in natural SI units, by Table A.4 on page 951. Hence
E = EPl ℏc
l ,
m0 = MPl ℏ
lc.
Thus, we have to replace E and m0 by
El
ℏc
and
m0lc
ℏ
,
respectively. This way, we pass over from (A.13) to (A.12).
Example 3. In the SI system, the Maxwell equations in a vacuum are given by
div D = ϱ,
div B = 0,
curl E = −˙B,
curl H = ˙D + j
(A.14)
along with D = ε0E and B = µ0H. Moreover, c2 = 1/ε0µ0. Alternatively,
ε0 div E = ϱ,
div B = 0,
curl E = −˙B,
c2 curl B = ˙E + µ0c2j.
(A.15)
Letting ε0 = µ0 = c := 1, we obtain the corresponding Maxwell equations in the
Planck system:
div E = ϱ,
div B = 0,
curl E = −˙B,
curl B = ˙E + j.
(A.16)
In order to transform equation (A.16) back to the SI system, we replace the quan-
tities x, t, E, B, ϱ, j by
x
m,
t
s,
E · mC
J ,
B · m2
sJ ,
ϱ · m3
C ,
j · m2
Cs ,
(A.17)
respectively, according to Table A.4 on page 951. In addition, the partial derivatives
∂/∂xj, ∂/∂t have to be replaced by
m ·
∂
∂xj ,
s · ∂
∂t,
respectively. Finally, we set
m := l,
s := l
c,
C := (cℏε0)1/2,
J := ℏc
l .
This way, we get (A.14). In fact, for example, the ﬁrst Maxwell equation div E = ϱ
from (A.16) means explicitly
∂jEj = ϱ,
in Cartesian coordinates. Here, ∂j = ∂/∂xj, and we sum over j = 1, 2, 3. By (A.17),
this is transformed into the equation
β · ∂jEj = ϱ,
where β := C2/Jm. Since β = cℏε0/cℏ= ε0, we obtain ε0 div E = ϱ. This is the
ﬁrst Maxwell equation from (A.15).
Example 4. In the SI system, the Schr¨odinger equation reads as

940
Appendix
iℏ∂ψ
∂t =
ℏ2
2m0 ∆ψ + Uψ.
(A.18)
Here, m0 and U denote the mass of the particle and the potential energy, respec-
tively. Letting ℏ= 1, we arrive at the Schr¨odinger equation
i∂ψ
∂t = ∆ψ
2m0 + Uψ
(A.19)
in the Planck system. In a Cartesian (x, y, z)-system, the Laplacian is deﬁned by
∆:= −∂2
∂x2 −∂2
∂y2 −∂2
∂z2 .
Note that our sign convention coincides with the use of the Laplacian in modern
diﬀerential geometry (Riemannian geometry) and string theory.9
In order to go back from the Planck system to the SI system10, we replace the
quantities x, t, U, m0, ψ by
x
m,
t
s,
U
J ,
m0 · m2
Js2 ,
ψ · m3/2,
respectively. The Laplacian contains spatial derivatives of second order. Thus, the
Laplacian ∆and the partial time derivative ∂/∂t have to be replaced by
m2 · ∆,
s · ∂
∂t.
Consequently, equation (A.19) is transformed into
iJsψt = (Js)2
2m0 ∆ψ + Uψ.
Since Js = ℏ, we get (A.18).
Example 5. Let us start with the Dirac equation
iγµ∂µψ = m0ψ
(A.20)
for the relativistic electron of rest mass m0 formulated in the Planck system. Here,
∂µ = ∂/∂xµ. Recall that we sum over µ from 0 to 3, by Einstein’s summation
convention. The deﬁnition of the Dirac–Pauli matrices γ0, γ1, γ2, γ3 can be found
on page 789. In order to pass over to the SI system, we replace the quantities
xµ, m0, ψ by
xµ
m ,
m0 · m2
Js2 ,
m3/2 · ψ,
respectively, according to Table A.4 on page 951. Note that the dimension of the
wave function ψ in the SI system is the same as in the case of the Schr¨odinger
equation. Hence
iγµ∂µψ = σm0ψ
9 In classic textbooks, one has to replace ∆by −∆.
10 The normalization condition
R
R3 ψψ†d3x = 1 implies that the wave function ψ
has the dimension m−3/2 in the SI system.

A.3 The Planck System
941
where σ := m/s2J. Since σ = c/ℏ, in the SI system the Dirac equation reads as
iℏγµ∂µψ = m0cψ.
(A.21)
The quantity λe := h/cm0 is called the Compton wave length of the electron.
Classical systems of units. In the context of the Maxwell equations, physi-
cists frequently use the Gaussian system or the Heaviside system, for historical
reasons. Let us explain the relation of these two systems to the SI system. The idea
is to measure all of the physical quantities by meter, second, kilogram, and Kelvin.
That is, we do not introduce a speciﬁc unit for electric charge. In the Gaussian
system, the electric force F between two electric charges Q1 and Q2 at distance r
(Coulomb law) is given by
F = Q1Q2
r2
.
Moreover, we use the Gaussian deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld
HG := cB.
This deﬁnition is motivated by the fact that the electric ﬁeld E and the Gaussian
magnetic ﬁeld HG possess the same physical dimension. In the Heaviside system,
we use the Coulomb law
F = Q1Q2
4πr2 .
In contrast to the Gaussian system from the 1830s, the Heaviside system from
the 1880s has the advantage that the factor 4π does not appear in the Maxwell
equations.
The Heaviside system of units. We use the SI system and set
ε0 := 1.
In the SI system, each physical quantity q can be written as
q = qPl · lAcBℏCεD
0 kE,
by (A.10) on page 938. Letting ε0 := 1, we get
q = qPl · lAcBℏCkE,
in the Heaviside system. Consequently,
q = qH · masbkgcKd.
That is, each physical quantity can be described by powers of meter, second, kilo-
gram, and Kelvin. In the Heaviside system, the Maxwell equations read as follows:
div E = ϱ,
div HG = 0,
curl E = −1
c
∂HG
∂t ,
curl HG = 1
c
∂E
∂t + j
c.
(A.22)
To obtain this, start with the Maxwell equations in the SI system. By (A.15) along
with c2 = 1/ε0µ0,
ε0 div E = ϱ,
div(cB) = 0,
curl E = −1
c
∂(cB)

Appendix
Letting ε0 := 1 and HG := cB, we get (A.22).
The Gaussian system of units. Using the rescaling
E ⇒E
4π ,
HG ⇒HG
4π ,
the Heaviside system passes over to the Gaussian system. In particular, the Maxwell
equations in the Gaussian system read as follows:
div E = 4πϱ,
div HG = 0,
curl E = −1
c
∂HG
∂t ,
curl HG = 1
c

∂t + 4πj
c .
(A.23)
Observe that the variants (A.22) and (A.23) of the Maxwell equations diﬀer by
the factor 4π. The Gaussian system is used in the 10-volume standard textbook on
theoretical physics by Landau and Lifshitz (1982).
A.4 The Energetic System
The most important physical quantity in elementary particle physics is given by
the energy of a particle accelerator. Therefore, particle physicists like to use energy
as basic unit. Let us discuss this. In the SI system, an arbitrary physical quantity
can be written as
q = qPl · lAcBℏCεD
0 kE,
by (A.10). In the energetic system, we set11
c = ℏ= ε0 = k := 1.
Hence
q = qPl · lA.
Consequently, each physical quantity has the physical dimension of some power of
length. In particular, for energy E we get
E = EPl · l−1ℏc,
in the SI system. Hence
E = EPl · l−1,
in the energetic system. That is, energy has the physical dimension of inverse length.
Conversely, length has the physical dimension of inverse energy in the
energetic system of units.
In terms of natural SI units, each physical quantity can be written as
q = qPl · mαsβJγCµKν.
It follows from c = ℏ= ε0 = k := 1 that
11 In particular, this implies µ0 = 1.

A.4 The Energetic System
943
s = m = J−1,
K = J,
C = 1.
(A.24)
This implies
q = qPl · JA,
where A = −α −β + γ + ν. This way, each physical quantity can be expressed by
powers of the Planck energy J. Using Table A.4 on page 951 along with (A.24),
we immediately obtain all the dimensions of important physical quantities in the
energetic system. For example, velocity has the dimension
v = vSI · ms−1,
in the SI system. Thus, in natural SI units,
v = vPl · ms−1.
In the energetic system m = s, by (A.24). Hence
v = vPl,
that is, velocity is dimensionless. Note that this follows more simply from the fact
that c := 1 in the energetic system; that is, the velocity of light is dimensionless.
Similarly, using the dimensionless quantities ℏ= ε0 = µ0 = k := 1 along with
the basic physical laws (i)-(vi) on page 936, we encounter the following physical
dimensions in the energetic system:
• [mass] = [momentum] = [temperature] = [energy],
• [length] = [time] = [energy]−1,
• [cross section] = [area] = [length]2 = [energy]
−2,
• [electric charge] = [velocity] = [action] = dimensionless,
• [force] = [electric ﬁeld] = [magnetic ﬁeld] = [energy]2,
• [potential] = [vector potential] = [energy],
• the coupling constants of quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics,
and electroweak interaction are dimensionless.
Since the electric charge and the coupling constants of the Standard Model in
particle physics are dimensionless in the energetic system, these quantities are in-
dependent of the rescaling of energy.
Examples. The Einstein relation E = m0c2 reads as
E = m0
in the energetic system, since c := 1.
The Maxwell equations (A.16), the Schr¨odinger equation (A.19), and the
Dirac equation (A.20) coincide in the Planck system and in the energetic
system.
In elementary particle physics, physicists like to use GeV (giga electron volt), where
J = 1.98 · 1019 GeV.
Consequently, from Table A.2 on page 937, we obtain the following conversion
formulas between the SI system and the energetic system:

944
Appendix
1 m .= 5 · 1016 (GeV)−1,
1 s .= 1.5 · 1024 (GeV)−1,
1 J .= 6.3 · 109 GeV,
1 K .= 1.4 · 10−13 GeV,
1 C .= 1.9 · 1018.
Depending on the energy scale, physicists also use mega electron volt, MeV. Here,
1 GeV = 103 MeV.
The physical dimension of cross sections. Observe that
ℏc = 1.97327 · 10−13 MeV · m.
This implies
m2 =
(ℏc)2
(1.97327)2 · 1026(MeV)−2.
In the SI system, the cross section σ is measured in m2. Setting
ℏ= c := 1,
we get the cross section in the energetic system measured in (MeV)−2. Conversely,
the passage from the energetic system to the SI system can be easily obtained by
using the replacement
σ
⇒
σ
(ℏc)2 .
In fact, if σ = a in the energetic system, then σ = (ℏc)2a in the SI system.
A.5 The Beauty of Dimensional Analysis
Physicists use the dimensionality of physical quantities in order to get important
information. Let us illustrate this by considering three examples: the pendulum,
Newton’s gravitational law, and Kolmogorov’s law for turbulence.
The pendulum. Consider a pendulum of length l and mass m. We are looking
for a formula for the period of oscillation, T, of the pendulum. We expect that
T depends on l, m, and the gravitational acceleration g. Thus, we begin with the
ansatz
T = C · lαmβgγ
where C is a dimensionless constant. Passing to dimensions we get
s = mαkgβmγs−2γ.
This implies β = 0, γ = −1
2, and α = −γ = 1
2, that is,
T = C
s
l
g .
(A.25)
The constant C has to be determined from experiment. The explicit solution of
the problem via elliptic integrals shows that, for small pendulum motions, equation
(A.25) is valid with C = 2π.

A.5 The Beauty of Dimensional Analysis
945
Newton’s gravitational law. In 1619 Kepler discovered empirically that the
motion of a planet satisﬁes the law
T 2
a3 = const
where T is the period of revolution, and a is the great semi-axis of the elliptic orbit.
In order to guess Newton’s gravitational law from this information, let us make the
ansatz
m¨x = C|x|µx
for the motion x = x(t) of the planet. Here, m is the mass of the planet, and C is
a constant. We want to show that µ = −3 is the only natural choice. To this end,
consider the rescaled motion y(t) := αx(βt). Then
m¨y = β2α−µC|y|µy.
We postulate that the equation of motion and the third Kepler law are independent
of the rescaling. This means that β2α−µ = 1 and
(T β)2/(αa)3 = T 2/a3.
Hence µ = −3. Summarizing, we obtain Newton’s gravitational law
m¨x =
C
|x|2 · x
|x|.
The Kolmogorov law for energy dissipation in turbulent ﬂows. It is
a typical property of turbulent ﬂow that there exist eddies of diﬀerent diameters
λ, where λmin ≤λ ≤λmax. One may think, for example, of clouds in the air
or of nebulas in astronomy. One ﬁnds that the large eddies tend to break down
into smaller eddies. This way, energy from large eddies ﬂows to smaller eddies.
Here, physicists assume that the energy of the smallest eddies with λ = λmin is
transformed into heat by friction (energy dissipation). Viscosity is of signiﬁcance
only for small eddies. We deﬁne
ε := loss of energy by dissipation
mass · time
.
This is the crucial physical quantity. Note that ε can be measured in experiments;
it is equal to the produced heat. Using the method of dimensional analysis, Kol-
mogorov obtained the law
ε =
Z λmax
λmin

Here, η and ϱ are viscosity and mass density, respectively. The function C is di-

found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, p. 514.
It turns out that dimensional analysis represents a magic wand of physicists. In
this setting, a minimum of hypotheses provides us a maximum of information.

A.6 The Similarity Principle in Physics
Rescaled SI units. Let us replace the SI units m, s, J, C, K with the rescaled
units
m∗, s∗, J∗, C∗, K∗,
where m∗= m+ · m, s∗= s+ · s, . . . with the real numbers m+, s+, . . . Then, each
physical quantity q can be represented as
q = q∗· mα
∗sβ
∗Jγ
∗Cµ
∗Kν
∗= q∗· [q].
The real number q∗is called the numerical value of q, and [q] is called the dimension
of q with respect to this system of units. In practice, one chooses m∗, s∗, ... in such
a way that the numerical values of the physical quantities are neither too large nor
too small. For example, if we want to study thin layers, then it is convenient to use
m∗:= 10−9m = 1nm (nanometer). In astronomy, one uses light years for measuring
distances, and so on.
The role of small quantities in physics. It is impossible to speak of a small
length L in physics. In fact, if
L = 1 meter,
then passing to a new length scale, we get
L = 1015 femtometer.
Therefore, it makes sense to speak about smallness only for dimensionless quantities.
For example, choose the radius rE of earth and the radius rp of a proton. Then the
dimensionless ratio
rp
rE = 6 · 10−21
is a small quantity compared with 1.
The experience of physicists shows that two diﬀerent theories are good approxi-
mations of each other if suitable dimensionless quantities are small. Let us consider
two crucial examples.
(i) Relativistic physics: Let v and c be the velocity of some particle and the velocity
of light, respectively. If the dimensionless quotient
v
c
is suﬃciently small, then the relativistic motion of the particle can be described
approximately by Newton’s classical mechanics. For example, the relativistic
mass
m =
m0
p
1 −v2/c2 = m0
„
1 −v2
2c2 + o
„v2
c2
««
,
v2
c2 →0
is approximately equal to the rest mass m0 if the quotient v/c is suﬃciently
small.
(ii) Quantum mechanics: Let S = E(t1 −t2) be the action for the motion of some
particle with constant energy E during a ﬁxed reasonable time interval [t1, t2],
say, one hour. If the dimensionless ratio
S
ℏ
is small, then the quantum motion of the particle can be approximately de-
scribed by Newton’s classical mechanics.

A.6 The Similarity Principle in Physics
947
In (i) and (ii), corrections to classical mechanics can be obtained by perturbation
theory if v/c and S/ℏare small. These are the post-Newtonian approximation and
the WKB approximation, respectively.
The fundamental similarity principle in physics. We postulate that
Physical processes are described by equations which are invariant under
rescaling of units. Explicitly, we demand that the laws of physics can be
written in such a way that, in a ﬁxed system of units, they only depend on
the dimensionless quotients
q
[q],
r
[r],
. . .
of all the physical quantities q, r, . . .
A special role is played by those physical quantities which are dimensionless in the
SI system. We expect that such quantities are related to important physical eﬀects.
The experience of physicists conﬁrms this. For example, the so-called ﬁne structure
constant
α :=
e2
4πε0ℏc =
1
137.04
represents the most important dimensionless quantity that can be constructed from
the universal constants. This constant measures the strength of the interaction be-
tween electrons, positrons, and photons in quantum electrodynamics. The smallness
of α is responsible for the fact that perturbation theory can be successfully applied
to quantum electrodynamics.
Example. Consider the Einstein relation
E = m0c2
between rest mass m0 and rest energy E of a particle. In any rescaled SI system,
E = E∗· J∗,
m0 = (m0)∗· J∗s2
∗m−2
∗,
c = c∗· m∗s−1
∗.
Hence E∗= (m0)∗c2
∗. Moreover, [E] = J∗, and
[m0][c]2 = J∗s2
∗m−2
∗
· m2
∗s−2
∗
= J∗.
This means that
E
[E] =
m0c2
[m0][c]2 .
Physicists frequently use such dimension tests in order to check the correctness of
formulas.
Counterexample. Let x and t denote position and time, respectively. The
equation
x = sin t
is not allowed in the SI system, since it is not invariant under the rescaling x ⇒αx
and t ⇒βt for nonzero constants α and β. In contrast to this, the equation
x
x0 = sin
„ t
t0
«
is admissible in any system of units if x and x0 as well as t and t0 possess the same
dimensions.

Appendix
Application to Reynolds numbers in turbulence. The motion of a viscous
ﬂuid in a 3-dimensional bounded domain G is governed by the so-called Navier–
Stokes equations12
ϱvt −ν∆x v + ϱ(v∇x) v = f −∇x p
on G,
∇xv = 0
on G,
v = 0
on ∂G.
The symbols possess the following physical meaning: v velocity vector, ϱ mass
density, f force density vector, p pressure, ν viscosity constant, x position vector,
and t time. Set
x = X · m∗,
t = T · s∗,
v = u · m∗s−1
∗,
ϱ = Ω· J∗s2
∗m−5
∗
and
f = F · J∗m−4
∗,
p = P · J∗m−3
∗,
ν = N · J∗m−3
∗,
where the coeﬃcients X, T, . . . are dimensionless. Furthermore, let d and v denote
the diameter of the domain G and a typical velocity of the ﬂuid, respectively. Nat-
urally enough, we choose
m∗:= d,
s∗:= dv−1,
J∗:= ϱv2d−3.
This way, we obtain the rescaled dimensionless Navier–Stokes equations
ut −Re−1∆X u + (u∇X) u = F −∇X P
on H,
∇Xu = 0
on H,
u = 0
on ∂H
with the dimensionless Reynolds number
Re := ϱvd
ν .
The rescaled domain H is obtained from the original domain G by replacing the
points x of G by d−1x. Physical experiments show that if the Reynolds number Re
is suﬃciently large, then turbulence occurs.
The rescaled dimensionless Navier–Stokes equations reﬂect an important simi-
larity principle in hydrodynamics. Explicitly, if two physical situations in diﬀerent
regions are governed by the same rescaled dimensionless Navier–Stokes equations,
then the physics is the same up to suitable similarity transformations.
Discovery of errors in physical computations. Physicists use physical
dimensions in order to detect errors in their computations. To explain this with a
simple example, suppose that we arrive at the equation
p = c3m0
(A.26)
after ﬁnishing some computation. Here, we use the following notation: p momentum,
m0 particle mass, c velocity of light. We want to check this. In the SI system, we
have the following dimensions:
[p] = kg · ms−1,
[m0] = kg,
[c] = ms−1.
Hence [p] = [c] · [m0]. It follows from (A.26) that [p] = [c]3[m0]. This implies
[c]2 = 1, which is a contradiction. Consequently, our result (A.26) is wrong. The
same argument can be used in the energetic system. However, we now have [c] = 1,
which does not lead to any contradiction. In other words, the energetic system of
units is too weak in order to detect that equation (A.26) is wrong, by checking
physical dimensions.

also be found in the Appendix to Zeidler, Oxford User’s Guide to Mathematics,
Oxford University Press, 2004. In the following Table A.4, observe that the two
quantities E and cB, possess the same physical dimension in the SI system. The
same is true for cD and H. Here, we use the notation:
• E electric ﬁeld vector,
• B magnetic ﬁeld vector,
• D electric ﬁeld intensity vector,
• H magnetic ﬁeld intensity vector.
In the literature, the terminology with respect to E, B, D, H is not uniform, for
historical reasons. Since E and B generate the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor (see
(14.50) on page 792), it follows from Einstein’s theory of special relativity that the
vector ﬁelds E and B (resp. D and H) form a unit. The mean magnetic ﬁeld of
earth has the strength Bearth = 0.5 Gauss = 0.5 · 10−4 Tesla.

A truly realistic mathematics should be conceived, in line with physics, as

Hermann Weyl (1885–1955)
The interplay between generality and individuality, deduction and con-
struction, logic and imagination – this is the profound essence of live math-
ematics.
Any one or another of the aspects can be at the center of a given achieve-
ment. In a far-reaching development all of them will be involved. Generally
speaking, such a development will start from the “concrete ground,” then
discard ballast by abstraction and rise to the lofty layers of thin air where
navigation and observations are easy; after this ﬂight comes the crucial
test of landing and reaching speciﬁc goals in the newly surveyed low plains
of individual “reality.”
In brief, the ﬂight into abstract generality must start from and return to
the concrete and speciﬁc.13

Epilogue
There are mathematicians who reject a binding of mathematics to physics,
and who justify mathematical work solely by aesthetical satisfaction which,
besides all the diﬃculty of the material, mathematics is able to oﬀer. Such
mathematicians are more likely to regard mathematics as a form of art
than science, and this point of view of mathematical unselﬁshness can be
characterized by the slogan “l’art pour l’art”.
On the other hand, there are physicists who regret that their science is so
much related to mathematics. They fear a loss of intuition in the natural
sciences. They consider the intimate relation with nature, the ﬁnding of
ideas in nature itself, which was given to Goethe (1749–1832) in such a
high degree, as being destroyed by mathematics, and their anger or sorrow
is the more serious the more they are forced to realize the inevitability of
mathematics.
Both points of view deserve serious consideration; because not only people
with narrow minds have expressed such opinions. Yes, one can say that
such a radical inclination to one side or the other, if not caused by a lack
of talent, is sometimes evidence of a deeper perception of science, as if
someone is interested in both sciences, but at the same time is satisﬁed
with obvious connections between mathematics and physics. . .
Mathematics is an organ of knowledge and an inﬁnite reﬁnement of lan-
guage. It grows from the usual language and world of intuitions as does
a plant from the soil, and its roots are the numbers and simple geomet-
rical intuitions. We do not know which kind of content mathematics (as
the only adequate language) requires; we cannot imagine into what depths
and distances this spiritual eye will lead us.14
Erich K¨ahler (1906–2000)
The most vitally characteristic fact about mathematics, in my opinion, is
its quite peculiar relationship to the natural sciences, or more generally, to
any science which interprets experience on a higher than purely descriptive
level. . .
I think that this is a relatively good approximation to truth – which is much
too complicated to allow anything but approximations – that mathematical
ideas originate in empirical facts, although the genealogy is sometimes long
and obscure. But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a
peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed
by almost entirely aesthetic motivations, than to anything else and, in
particular, to an empirical science.
But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of
least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into
a multitude of insigniﬁcant tributaries, and that the discipline will become
a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great
distance from its empirical sources or after much abstract inbreeding, a
mathematical object is in danger of degeneration. At the inception, the
style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then
the danger signal is up. . .
Whenever this stage is reached, then the only remedy seems to be a re-
juvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly
empirical ideas. I am convinced that this is a necessary condition to con-

serve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that this will remain
equally true in the future.15
John von Neumann (1903–1957)
I want to say a word about the communication between mathematicians
and physicists.
It has been very bad in the past, and some of the blame is doubtless to be
laid on the physicist’s shoulders. We tend to be very vague, and we don’t
know what the problem is until we have already seen how to solve it. We
drive mathematicians crazy when we try to explain what our problems are.
When we write articles we don’t do a good enough job of specifying how
certain we are about our statements; we do not distinguish guesses from
theorems.
On the other hand, since I have said a lot of nice things about mathematics,
I have to say that the mathematicians carry an even greater burden of guilt
for this communication problem, largely because of their elitism. They
often have, it seems to me, as their ideal the savant who is understandable
only to a few co-specialists and who writes articles that one has to spend
years to try to fathom.
When physicists write articles, they generally start them with a paragraph
saying, “Up until now, this has been thought to be the case. Now, so –
and – so has pointed out this problem. In this article, we are going to
try to suggest a resolution of this diﬃculty.” On the other hand, I have
seen books of mathematics, not just articles but books, in which the ﬁrst
sentence in the preface was, “Let H be a nilpotent subgroup of. . . ” These
books are written in what I would call a lapidary style. The idea seems
to be that there should be no word in the book that is not absolutely
necessary, that is inserted merely to help the reader to understand what
is going on.
I think this is getting much better. I ﬁnd it is wonderful how mathemati-
cians these days are willing to explain their ﬁeld to interested physicists.
This situation is improving, partly because as Iz Singer mentioned, we re-
alize now that in certain areas we have much more in common than we
had thought, but I think a lot more has to be done. There is still too much
mathematics written which is not only not understandable to experimental
or theoretical physicists, but is not even understandable to mathematicians
who are not the graduate students of the author.16
Steven Weinberg (born 1933)
Relations between mathematics and physics vary with time. Right now,
and for the past few years, harmony reigns and a honeymoon blossoms.
However, I have seen other times, times of divorce and bitter battles, when
the sister sciences declared each other as useless – or worse. The following
exchange between a famous theoretical physicist and an equally famous
mathematician might have been typical, some ﬁfteen or twenty years ago:
Says the physicist: “I have no use for mathematics. All the mathematics I
ever need, I invent in one week.”

Epilogue
Answers the mathematician: “You must mean the seven days it took the
Lord to create the world.”
A slightly more reliable document is found in the preface of the ﬁrst edi-
tion of Hermann Weyl’s book on group theory and quantum mechanics
from 1928. He writes: “I cannot abstain from playing the role of an (often
unwelcome) intermediary in this drama between mathematics and physics,
which fertilize each other in the dark, and deny and misconstrue one an-
other when face to face.”
This dramatic situation, described here by one of the great masters in both
sciences, is a result of recent times. At the time of Newton (1643–1727)
disharmony between mathematics and physics seemed unthinkable and un-
natural, since both were his brainchildren; and close symbiosis persisted
through the whole of the eighteenth century. The rift arose around 1800
and was caused by the development of pure mathematics (represented by
number theory) on the one hand, and of a new kind of physics, indepen-
dent of mathematics, which developed out of chemistry, electricity and
magnetism on the other. This rift was widened in Germany under the in-
ﬂuence of Goethe (1749–1832) and his followers, Schelling (1775–1854) and
Hegel (1770–1831) and their “Naturphilosophie”.
Our protagonists are Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), as the creator of
modern number theory, and Michael Faraday (1791-1867) as the inventor
of physics without mathematics (in the strict sense of the word).
It would be foolish, of course, to claim the nonexistence of number theory
before Gauss. An amusing document may illustrate the historical develop-
ment. Erich Hecke’s famous Lectures on the Theory of Algebraic Numbers
has on its last page a “timetable”, which chronologically lists the names
and dates of the great number theoreticians, starting with Euclid (300
B.C.) and ending with Hermann Minkowski (1864–1909). As a physicist, I
am impressed to ﬁnd so many familiar names in this Hall of Fame: Fermat
(1601–1665), Euler (1707–1783), Lagrange (1736–1813), Legendre (1752–
1833), Fourier (1768–1830), and Gauss. In fact, we cannot ﬁnd a single
great number theoretician before Gauss, whom we would not count among
the great physicists, provided we disregard antiquity. Specialization starts
after 1800 with names like Kummer (1810–1891), Galois (1811–1832), and
Eisenstein (1823–1852); who were all under the great inﬂuence of Gauss’
Disquisitiones arithmeticae from 1801. In this speciﬁc sense, Gauss’ book
marks the dividing line between mathematics as a universal science and
mathematics as a union of special disciplines, and between the “g´eom`etre”
as a universal “savant” in the sense of the eighteenth century and the
specialized “math´ematicien” of modern times. As is typical for a man of
transition, Gauss does not belong to either category, he was universal and
specialized. The struggle raged within him – and made him suﬀer.
Res Jost (1918–1990)
Mathematics and physics since 1800: discord and sympathy17
By a particular prerogative, not only does each man advance day by day in
the sciences, but all men together make continual progress as the universe
ages. . . Thus, the entire body of mankind as a whole, over many centuries,
must be considered as a single man, who lives forever and continues to
learn.
Blaise Pascal (1623–1662)
