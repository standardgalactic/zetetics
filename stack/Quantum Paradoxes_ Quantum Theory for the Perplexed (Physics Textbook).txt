Preface
Quantum Paradoxes is a series of studies in quantum theory. Each chapter begins with a
paradox motivating the study, in the rest of the chapter, of a fundamental aspect of the theory.
We hope that this style in physics – progress through paradox – will rub off on readers. The
studies, taken together, set out a new interpretation of quantum theory.
Elements of this interpretation include topological phases (the Aharonov-Bohm effect and
its generalizations), “modular” variables, nonlocal measurements and relativistic causality,
time-symmetric boundary conditions, measurement of the quantum wave, “weak” measure-
ments and “weak” values, and new axioms for quantum theory. A treatment of “quantum
measurements”, starting in Chap. 7, plays an important role in the book. Indeed, measurement
is so important that many of the works cited in the book can be found in the anthology Quantum
Theory and Measurement, edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek (Princeton: Princeton U.
Press), 1983; these citations include a note “reprinted in WZ” with page numbers.
For whom is this book written? It is designed for physics students, physicists and philoso-
phers of science with an interest in fundamental aspects of quantum theory. The ﬁrst two chap-
ters of Quantum Paradoxes do not require prior knowledge of quantum theory, and Chaps. 3–4
introduce basic notions of states, observables and quantum phases, so students can use the
book even during a ﬁrst course in quantum mechanics. It is not, however, a substitute for such
a course.
Each chapter ends with a problem set. Problems marked with an asterisk (*) are, in general,
less straightforward than others.
It is a pleasure to thank those who have helped us write this book. We are indebted to col-
leagues (including students) who read parts of the book at one stage or another, most especially
Philip Pearle and Fritz Rohrlich, and to Elisabeth Warschawski for much encouragement and
technical support. We thank Shula Volk for opening her ceramics studio to us at odd hours
of the day and night, as reported in Sect. 2.1. We also acknowledge support from the Giladi
Program of the Israeli Ministry of Absorption and from the Ticho Fund.

1 The Uses of Paradox
On November 9, 1919, The New York Times reported solar eclipse observations conﬁrming a
prediction of Einstein’s general theory of relativity: rays of starlight bend near the sun. It also
reported that when Einstein sent his theory to the publishers, “he warned them that there were
not more than twelve persons in the world who would understand it . . . .” Was there a time
when only “twelve wise men” understood the general theory of relativity? “I do not believe
there ever was such a time,” commented Feynman. “There might have been a time when only
one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after
people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other,
certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands
quantum mechanics.” [1]
What is the problem with quantum mechanics? It is a spectacularly successful theory.
It governs the structure of all matter. Measurements of Planck’s constant are accurate to
better than a part in a million, and still more accurate measurements conﬁrm predictions of
quantum electrodynamics. But along with the spectacular successes of quantum mechanics
come spectacular difﬁculties of interpretation. “Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can
possibly avoid it, ‘But how can it be like that?”’ Feynman continued, “because you will get
‘down the drain’, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how
it can be like that.”
We can stop asking ourselves, “But how can it be like that?” We may indeed despair of
asking a question that Einstein, Schr¨odinger and Feynman could not answer. But we cannot
stop using quantum mechanics. So the problem is that everybody uses quantum mechanics
and nobody knows how it can be like that. Our relationship with quantum mechanics recalls a
Woody Allen joke:
This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, “Doc, my brother’s crazy – he thinks he’s a
chicken! And, uh, the doctor says, “Well, why don’t you turn him in?” And the guy
says, “I would, but I need the eggs!”
We say, “Quantum mechanics is crazy – but we need the eggs!”
Such a relationship with quantum mechanics is paradoxical. In this book, we will not be
satisﬁed to have a paradoxical relationship with quantum mechanics. We will not stop asking,
“How can it be like that?” But we will use paradox repeatedly in order to understand quantum
mechanics better.

The Uses of Paradox
1.1
Paradox in Physics
We will use paradox to probe quantum mechanics. Can paradox be useful? The history of
physics shows how useful. As Wheeler [2] put it, “No progress without a paradox!” In this
section, we deﬁne and classify physics paradoxes; the next sections present examples of each
class.
A paradox is an argument that starts with apparently acceptable assumptions and leads by
apparently valid deductions to an apparent contradiction. Since logic admits no contradictions,
either the apparently acceptable assumptions are not acceptable, or the apparently valid deduc-
tions are not valid, or the apparent contradiction is not a contradiction. A paradox is useful
because it can show that something is wrong even when everything appears to be right. It does
not show what is wrong. But something is wrong – something we thought we understood –
and a paradox moves us to reexamine the argument until we ﬁnd out what is wrong.
We can classify physics paradoxes according to what is wrong. There are three broad
classes: “errors”, “gaps” and “contradictions”.
Many paradoxes arise from errors. An error in logic or in our understanding of the laws
of physics easily leads us to an apparent contradiction. Our error may be simple or it may
be subtle, but it is just an error; once we recognize it, we have resolved the paradox. What
distinguishes the ﬁrst class is that these paradoxes do not arise from any ﬂaw in the theory. In
the special theory of relativity, for example, erroneous assumptions about simultaneity lead us
to paradox. (See Sect. 1.2.) Resolving the paradox, we improve our understanding of special
relativity, but we do not improve the theory. Another example of a paradox arising from an error
is Einstein’s clock-in-the-box paradox. (See Sect. 2.4.) Einstein made an error and arrived at
an apparent contradiction in quantum theory. The resolution of the paradox came as a surprise,
but it did not show quantum theory to be ﬂawed in any way.
Other paradoxes do show a physical theory to be ﬂawed. A gap in physical theory is a ﬂaw.
As an example of a gap, consider Wheeler’s paradox of black hole entropy. According to the
general theory of relativity, nothing can escape a black hole. We, as outside observers, can
measure the electric and gravitational ﬁelds of a black hole, and hence its charge and mass (and
angular momentum); but we have no other access to a black hole. So a black hole at rest has
only three properties: charge, mass and angular momentum. Such a simple physical system
can hardly have much entropy. Now suppose a complicated physical system, containing a
lot of entropy, falls into a black hole. What happens to the entropy? Apparently it vanishes.
But vanishing entropy violates the second law of thermodynamics. Wheeler told his student
Bekenstein about this paradox:
The idea that a black hole had no entropy troubled me, but I didn’t see any escape
from this conclusion. In a joking mood one day in my ofﬁce, I remarked to Jacob
Bekenstein that I always feel like a criminal when I put a cup of hot tea next to a
glass of iced tea and then let the two come to a common temperature, conserving the
world’s energy but increasing the world’s entropy. My crime, I said to Jacob, echoes
down to the end of time, for there is no way to erase or undo it. But let a black hole
swim by and let me drop the hot tea and the cold tea into it. Then is not all evidence
of my crime erased forever? This remark was all that Jacob needed [3].

Bekenstein [4] proposed that a black hole has entropy proportional to the square of its mass.
If any physical system falls into a black hole, the mass of the black hole increases – and hence
the entropy. He demonstrated that the increase in entropy is at least as great as the entropy of
the infalling system, thus corroborating the second law and resolving Wheeler’s paradox.
Wheeler’s paradox indicated a ﬂaw – but not a fatal ﬂaw – in general relativity and ther-
modynamics. The resolution of the paradox did not invalidate either theory. The apparent
contradiction between the theories arose from a gap in thermodynamics – we didn’t know how
to extend the concept of entropy to black holes – and Bekenstein’s proposal ﬁlled the concep-
tual gap. Another paradox in the second class came, in turn, from Bekenstein’s proposal: if
thermodynamics extends to black holes, then black holes must emit as well as absorb heat. But
nothing can escape a black hole! This paradox, too, arose from a conceptual gap, as Hawking
discovered: one consequence of the uncertainty principle is that black holes radiate [5]. Many
such paradoxes appear in this book.
A contradiction in physical theory is a fatal ﬂaw. Paradoxes in the third class are associated
with revolutions in physics, because they indicate that the physical theory behind the paradox
is wrong. Bohr faced such a paradox in 1911. In that year, Rutherford reported experiments
on neutral atoms, showing that the positive charges in atoms – but not the negative charges
(electrons) – are concentrated in nuclei. According to classical theory, such atoms should be
unstable: like all accelerating charges, the electrons should radiate energy, and fall into the
nuclei. Matter should collapse in a split second. So why is matter stable? Bohr realized that
this paradox had no resolution in classical physics. Only a new physical theory – quantum
theory – could resolve it. The only resolution was a revolution.
The paradox arose for Bohr as a contradiction between physical theory and experiment.
Especially useful are paradoxes that arise as contradictions within physical theory. Such a
paradox can show that a physical theory is wrong even when no experiment contradicts it. The
paradox then starts us searching for a new theory. (See Sects. 1.4 and 2.2.)

Errors
Every student of special relativity encounters the Twin Paradox [6]. Here is a Triplet Paradox.
Dumpy, Grumpy and Jump – identical triplets wearing synchronized wristwatches – once lived
together happily at home. But Grumpy got mad at Dumpy and decided to move to another
city. When he arrived, his watch was still synchronized with his brothers’ watches, because he
travelled very slowly compared to the speed of light. (In this paradox we set the speed of light
to 1000 m/s.)
A month later, Jump decided to visit Grumpy. Dumpy accompanied Jump to the train
station, and Jump took a seat in the train. Then the train accelerated, within a second, to 100
m/s. At the end of this second, Jump’s cabin passed Dumpy on the platform. Jump and Dumpy
glanced at each other through a cabin window and noticed that their watches still showed the
same time (to within a second). Hence Jump did not age appreciably during the acceleration.
For the rest of the trip, the train’s speed and direction were constant. When it arrived, it stopped
within a second.
Dumpy and Grumpy expected that Jump would be slightly younger than them when he
arrived, and that his watch would lag behind their watches, for Jump had been moving fast

relative to them. But Jump expected the opposite: Dumpy and Grumpy would be slightly
younger, and their watches would lag behind his. He told himself, “After one second of
acceleration, Dumpy’swatchandmineshowedthesametime(towithinasecond); andDumpy’s
and Grumpy’s watches were still synchronized. Afterwards, the inertial reference frame of
Dumpy and Grumpy moved fast relative to mine; so time passed more slowly for them, and
their watches now lag behind mine.” When he arrived, he discovered that his watch lagged
Grumpy’s by about half a minute! On the one hand, Jump’s expectation should be just as
correct as that of his brothers; there can be no preferred frame in special relativity. On the other
hand, Jump and his brothers cannot all be correct. So special relativity contradicts itself!
The Triplet Paradox belongs to the class of errors in that it does not arise from any ﬂaw or
misconception in the special theory of relativity. It arises, rather, from incorrect intuition. We
can often use paradoxes in this class to improve our intuition.
1.3
Gaps
In 1856, Clausius stated the second law of thermodynamics as follows: heat cannot ﬂow from a
colder body to a hotter body without an accompanying process (i.e. work). Clausius regarded
the second law as exact, and tried to derive it from the laws of mechanics. In 1871 he published
a paper [7] in which he offered a mechanical explanation of the second law. He did not know
that Boltzmann had published much the same explanation ﬁve years earlier [8]. Boltzmann
(who, like Clausius, regarded the second law as exact) was quick to claim priority [9]. Yet
Clausius did not wholly concede [10]. Maxwell was amused. “But it is rare sport to see those
learned Germans contending for the priority of the discovery that the 2nd law of θ∆cs is the
Hamiltonische Princip . . . .” he wrote. “The Hamiltonische Princip, the while, soars along in
a region unvexed by statistical considerations . . . .” [11]. Boltzmann and Clausius were both
wrong. The second law has no mechanical explanation; it is statistical.
What made Maxwell so sure that the second law is statistical? In 1859 he had calculated
that the distribution of molecular speeds in any gas, hot or cold, would range from zero to
inﬁnity. (Molecules were still an untested hypothesis at the time.) In 1867 he had considered
the following thought experiment. Gas ﬁlls a sealed, insulated box, divided by a diaphragm.
The gas is hot on one side of the diaphragm and cold on the other side; yet there are fast
molecules in the cold gas and slow molecules in the hot gas. “Now conceive a ﬁnite being who
knows the paths and velocities of all the molecules by simple inspection but who can do no
work except open and close a hole in the diaphragm by means of a slide without mass.” The
being opens and closes the hole in such a way that fast molecules in the cold gas enter the hot
gas and slow molecules in the hot gas enter the cold gas. Energy gradually ﬂows from the cold
gas to the hot gas. After many molecules have crossed through the hole, “the hot system has
got hotter and the cold colder and yet no work has been done, only the intelligence of a very
observant and neat-ﬁngered being has been employed” [12]. The “neat-ﬁngered being” soon
had a name: “Maxwell’s demon”.
Maxwell’s demon violates the second law of thermodynamics, as formulated by Clausius:
it does no work, yet it causes heat to ﬂow from a cold gas to a hot gas. It does not, however,
violate the laws of mechanics. Hence the second law cannot be a mechanical law. Maxwell’s

thought experiment was a paradox for Clausius’s formulation; it does not disprove the second
law, but it shows that the second law can only be a statistical law.
Another formulation of the second law states that the entropy of a closed system always
tends to increase to thermal equilibrium. But this formulation, too, leads to a paradox. It
assumes an arrow of time, relative to which entropy tends to increase. But what if there is
no arrow of time? What if the “arrow of time” is no more intrinsic than the “arrow of space”
deﬁned by gravity? (See Fig. 1.1.) Suppose that two sealed, insulated boxes are ﬁlled with
gas, e.g. helium in one box and neon in the other, and at time t = 0, neither gas is at thermal
equilibrium. Now on the one hand, if the boxes are perfectly insulated, they could contain two
opposite arrows of time. Assume that the gases have contrary evolutions: the entropy of the
neon increases in time while the entropy of the helium decreases in (the same) time. Such an
assumption is plausible since the laws of mechanics are invariant under time reversal and the

boxes do not interact. On the other hand, suppose the boxes do interact, with an interaction
that is independent of time; assume that the position and momentum of each atom at t = 0
is the same as before. According to the second law, the combined entropy of the two gases
always tends to increase; that is, any perturbation of the helium atoms, however small, will
destroy the precise coordination of their positions and momenta that allows their entropy to
decrease. So in the evolution of the two gases after t = 0, their total entropy increases. But the
same reasoning applies in reverse to the evolution of the gases before t = 0: their total entropy
must decrease until t = 0. Extrapolation forwards from t = 0 implies that the neon (with its
increasing entropy) overwhelms the helium; extrapolation backwards from t = 0 implies that
the helium overwhelms the neon. This paradox shows that the second law contains no arrow
of time. (See also Chap. 10.)
The second law is almost exact, i.e. the probability of a signiﬁcant violation is very small.
Maxwell’s demon can violate the second law, yet the probability of a signiﬁcant violation
is very small. Still, after Maxwell, the demon turned up in new paradoxes. The demon kept
turning up, because it is easier to imagine a demon that can violate the second law signiﬁcantly,
than to prove that it can’t. For example, in Fig. 1.2 the demon is a trapdoor that apparently
allows only fast molecules of the cold gas to enter the hot gas.
In 1914, Smoluchowski
showed that this demon fails to violate the second law signiﬁcantly because the trapdoor
itself thermalizes, eventually opening and closing in random ﬂuctuations [13]. More recent
paradoxes allow Maxwell’s demon to measure and compute. Their resolution involves an
application of information theory to thermodynamics [14].
All the paradoxes in this section belong to the class of gaps; they show up ﬂaws or gaps in
how we understand the second law, but do not invalidate it. The resolutions of these paradoxes
correct our formulation of the second law and extend the concepts we use to apply it, but do
not contradict the formalism of thermodynamics.

1.4
Contradictions

1.4
Contradictions
Maxwell’s equations imply that a changing electromagnetic ﬁeld in empty space propagates
as a wave with constant speed c. On the face of it, this implication contradicts Newton’s
mechanics. According to Newton, if we run after a light wave, its speed (relative to us)
decreases. Velocities add as vectors: if the velocity of a light ray with respect to Alice is vA
and the (nonzero) velocity of Alice with respect to Bob is vAB, then the velocity of the ray
with respect to Bob is vA + vAB. The ray cannot have the same speed for Alice and for Bob.
What, then, corresponds to c? Physicists of Maxwell’s time assumed that electromagnetic
waves propagate through a medium, the “aether”, and what corresponds to c is the speed of
the wave relative to the aether.
At ﬁrst, the aether was a plausible assumption. Even before Maxwell, physicists assumed
that light propagates through an aether. Every wave known to them, from ripples in water
to sound in air, propagated through some medium. Fresnel showed in 1818 that an aether
at absolute rest, unaffected by the earth’s motion through it, would be consistent with the
“aberration effect”, a seasonal shift in the apparent positions of stars in the sky. Over the rest
of nineteenth century, however, the aether became less and less plausible. In 1887, Michelson
and Morley measured the speed of light parallel and perpendicular to the earth’s motion, and
found no difference.1 Hence the aether and the earth must move together. Or else the earth is
at absolute rest – Copernicus was wrong after all!
Aether was a paradox. But since an aether at absolute rest made sense of c (and deﬁned
the “absolute space” that Newton had postulated), most physicists chose tacitly to live with it.
They then had to explain the contradictory experiments.
For Einstein, the paradox was different. He concluded early on (even without the Michel-
son–Morley experiment) that there is no aether. He was then left with the contradiction between
Newton’s mechanics and electromagnetism. At age 16, Einstein formulated the paradox as
follows:
If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum),
I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic ﬁeld at rest though
spatially oscillating. There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis
of experience nor according to Maxwell’s equations. From the very beginning it
appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer,
everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who,
relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the ﬁrst observer know, or be able
to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion? [15]
Newton proved that his laws of mechanics are the same for all observers in uniform (rectilinear)
motion; and Maxwell [16] realized that – apart from the aether – electromagnetism is the same
for all observers in uniform motion. If there is no aether, then the laws of mechanics and
electromagnetism must be the same for all observers in uniform motion. The paradox was that
in Newton’s mechanics, which relates such observers by Galilean transformations, the speed of
light is not a constant; in Maxwell’s electromagnetism, which relates such observers by Lorentz
1To show that the basement laboratory of Michelson and Morley did not trap aether, Morley and Miller later
repeated the measurements on a hilltop.

The Uses of Paradox
transformations, the speed of light is a constant, as it is in experiment. Years later, Einstein
resolved the paradox by modifying Newton’s mechanics so that Lorentz transformations, rather
than Galilean transformations, relate observers in uniform motion.
Indeed, paradox can be useful but, as this example shows, the paradox has to be the right
paradox. Where other physicists saw a contradiction between physical theory and experiment,
Einstein (and to an extent Poincar´e) saw a contradiction within physical theory. What is striking
in this example is how ready Einstein was to discard the aether assumption when it had become
implausible (but still accepted by all other physicists) and to face a fundamental contradiction
in physical theory. He was thus able to identify the right paradox behind the wrong paradox,
and later to resolve it.
1.5
Overview of the Book
In this book we have two goals. Our primary goal is a deeper understanding of all funda-
mental aspects of quantum mechanics. The ﬁrst chapters do not assume prior knowledge
of quantum mechanics. Chapter 2 discusses uncertainty and consistency in quantum theory,
without the formalism, and Chap. 3 introduces the notion of a quantum state, while discussing
the completeness of quantum theory. Chapter 4 introduces the quantum phase and probes its
unique role in the theory with the help of Schr¨odinger’s equation. Chapters 5 and 6 apply
the phase in unconventional ways and raise unconventional questions about quantum mechan-
ics. Chapters 7–11 present a theory of quantum measurements, a powerful tool for probing
quantum mechanics. Chapters 12–13 explore connections among the Feynman path integral,
Berry’s phase and the Aharonov–Bohm and Aharonov–Casher effects. Quantum mechan-
ics is nonrelativistic throughout Chaps. 1–13, but Chaps. 14–17 discuss relativistic quantum
measurements, measurements of the quantum wave, and “weak” measurements within a new
formalism adapted to relativity. Chapter 18 proposes simple physical axioms for quantum
theory.
Our secondary goal is to encourage physicists to use paradoxes creatively, both in teaching
and in research. We use paradoxes all through the book. Each chapter (except this one) begins
with a paradox that motivates the rest of the chapter. Try to resolve the paradoxes as you read!
Chapter 2 begins with a paradox from the class of contradictions; Chapter 10 begins with a
paradox from the class of errors. Chapters 3–8 and Chaps. 11–18 all begin with paradoxes
from the class of gaps; and it is an open question to which class the paradox in Chap. 9 belongs.

2 How to Weigh a Quantum
Now we start to use paradoxes to investigate quantum theory and its mathematical formalism,
quantum mechanics. We need the mathematical formalism, but we do not need it yet. We ﬁrst
take up the question: Is quantum theory consistent? From 1927 to 1930, Bohr and Einstein
debated this question [1]. Both were familiar with the formalism, yet they hardly referred
to it. They did not need to. With thought experiments, Einstein would argue that quantum
theory is inconsistent; and Bohr would refute Einstein’s arguments, one by one. After these
refutations, Einstein conceded that quantum theory is consistent. So we can gain insight into
quantum theory without the mathematical formalism. This chapter takes us to the climax of
the Bohr-Einstein debate.
2.1
Why does the Color of the Light Change?
Let’s visit a potter’s studio. In the studio we see boxes of clay, jars of powdered glaze, spoons,
brushes and rolling pins, and a potter’s wheel; but what stands out is the kiln, sitting on metal
posts, with its thick ceramic walls covered in metal. The huge, hot kiln dominates the studio.
We peep into the hot kiln through a peephole in the door of the kiln. What do we see?
As the kiln’s temperature reaches 1200 ◦C, the potter turns off the heating element. We then
see the glow of matter heated to this temperature. The temperature of the kiln drops slowly,
despite the peephole – roughly a degree per minute. So, to a good approximation, the kiln
remains at thermal equilibrium. At 1200 ◦C (1473 K), the light we see through the peephole
is orange mixed with yellow, and so bright it hurts the eyes. Almost everything in the kiln is
the same color, though objects close to the peephole look darker than the background. In a
few hours, the temperature of the kiln drops to 1000 ◦C (1273 K); the light is orange and less
bright than before. We can see the outlines of some objects in the kiln. In a few more hours
the temperature drops to 800 ◦C (1073 K) and the light is less intense; the color of the light
is a mixture of orange and red. When, a few hours later, the temperature falls below 600 ◦C
(873 K), we see only a dull red glow.
The correlation between temperature and the color of light is familiar and we take it for
granted. We use such expressions as “red hot” and “white hot”. A potter can judge the
temperature of a kiln by the color of its glow. All the same, the correlation is mysterious. We
understand why the intensity of the light changes: light has energy and the energy of the kiln
decreases with the decreasing temperature. But why does the color of the light change?
Let us discuss in more detail how it changes. The electromagnetic radiation from a kiln is
a mixture of light frequencies and other frequencies. The total energy in the radiation depends

on the size of the kiln, but the density of energy in the radiation does not; it depends only on
the temperature of the kiln. Let u(ν, T) denote the density of energy in radiation of frequency
ν coming from a kiln at absolute temperature T. That is, for small dν, the density of energy
in radiation with frequencies between ν and ν + dν is u(ν, T)dν. In 1860, Kirchhoff proved
that u(ν, T) is the same for any black body in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. (By
deﬁnition, a black body does not reﬂect radiation; but it emits radiation, so, despite the name,
black bodies can have color. A kiln emits black-body radiation.) But Kirchhoff did not have
sufﬁcient data to determine u(ν, T). In 1896 Wien proposed a law to ﬁt the data that had
gradually accumulated:
u(ν, T) = bν3e−aν/T ,
where a and b are empirical constants. Then in 1900, when new data contradicted Wien’s law,
Planck proposed
u(ν, T) = 8πhν3
c3
1
ehν/kT −1 ,
(2.1)
where k is Boltzmann’s constant, c is the speed of light, and h is Planck’s constant. (Planck’s
value for his constant was h = 6.55 × 10−27 erg sec; as of 2004, the accepted value is
h = [6.6260693 ± 0.0000011] × 10−27 erg sec. We note ℏ≡h/2π ≈1.054572 × 10−27 erg
sec.) Both Wien’s law and Planck’s law imply that the color of the light from a black body
changes with its temperature, because the shape of u(ν, T) changes with T. And indeed the
color changes, not only at temperatures that a kiln can reach, but also at higher temperatures.
(See Fig. 2.1(a).)
We have deﬁned the energy density u(ν, T) as a function of the frequency of radiation.
We can just as well deﬁne energy density as a function of the wavelength λ of radiation. For
small λ, let uλ(λ, T)dλ be the density of energy in radiation with wavelengths between λ and
λ + dλ. For any two wavelengths λ1 = c/ν1 and λ2 = c/ν2, we must have

so Eq. (2.1) implies

ehc/λkT −1 .
Figure 2.1(b) shows that the light from a kiln at 1473 K is mainly red, orange, yellow and
green, mixing to a yellowish orange; at 1273 K the light is mainly red, orange and yellow; at
1073 K the light is a mixture of red and orange; and at 873 K the light is dark red. (See also
Prob. 2.1.) But why does the color of the light change?
Can we derive u(ν, T)? Boltzmann and Gibbs had already invented statistical mechanics
when Planck proposed his law. A principle of statistical mechanics, the equipartition theorem,
states that the average kinetic energy of a system with n degrees of freedom at temperature
T is nkT/2. Between 1900 and 1905, Rayleigh, Einstein and Jeans applied the equipartition
theorem to Maxwell’s electromagnetism to obtain
u(ν, T) = 8πν2
c3 kT .

of differences between light emission (from a computer screen) and reﬂection (from a printed page), the
colors here differ slightly from those in his web site www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color.html.]
Each frequency ν of electromagnetic radiation corresponds to two degrees of freedom (two
independent polarizations) and the density of frequencies is 4πν2/c3. (See Prob. 2.2.) So
Eq. (2.2) is simply kT times1 the density of degrees of freedom, 8πν2/c3. Note that Planck’s
law (unlike Wien’s law) approaches Eq. (2.2) for ν →0, but both laws contradict Eq. (2.2) for
large ν.
Equation (2.2), in which T appears as an overall factor, implies that only the intensity of
the light from a kiln changes with temperature, not the color. But Eq. (2.2) is wrong: if we
integrate Eq. (2.2) to obtain the overall energy U(T) in the radiation ﬁeld,
U(T) =

radiation as they are for harmonic oscillators.

we ﬁnd that the integral diverges. Since statistical mechanics and electromagnetism together
imply this divergence, statistical mechanics and electromagnetism together contain a contra-
diction. We must modify one or both of these two theories to make them compatible.
So why does the color of the light change? We can guess that it changes to avoid the
divergence. The integral of Eq. (2.1) does not diverge. And Eq. (2.1) – Planck’s law – implies
that the color of the light changes with temperature. (See Prob. 2.3.)

Planck’s own derivation of Eq. (2.1) was “an act of desperation . . . I had to obtain a positive
result, under any circumstance and at whatever cost”, as he put it [2]. Oddly, Planck was not
aware of Eq. (2.2); but he was aware that he could not derive Eq. (2.1) in any reasonable way. To
derive his law, he assumed that matter is composed of harmonic oscillators that exchange energy
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This assumption was reasonable enough. He also assumed that
a harmonic oscillator of frequency ν could not exchange energy in arbitrary amounts, but only
in quanta of energy hν. This assumption was completely unreasonable. According to classical
theory, h should vanish; and as h vanishes, Planck’s law reduces to Eq. (2.2).
Five years later, Einstein extended Planck’s assumption. He assumed that electromagnetic
radiation itself consists of quanta; radiation of frequency ν consists of quanta of energy E with
E = hν .
(2.3)
Einstein applied Eq. (2.3) to the photoelectric effect. Metals exposed to ultraviolet light emit
electrons. The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency, but not on the in-
tensity, of the light. Einstein predicted a linear relation between the light frequency and the
energy of the electrons, with a slope, independent of the type of metal, equal to Planck’s con-
stant. Experiments veriﬁed these predictions by 1916. Yet almost no one accepted Einstein’s
hypothesis of light quanta [3]. Light is a wave; how could light quanta produce interference?
Then in 1923, Compton showed that light, scattering off electrons at rest, imparts momen-
tum in an amount that depends on the wavelength of the light, but not on its intensity. He found
a clear relationship between θ, the angle through which the light scattered, and the change in
its wavelength:
λf −λi = h
mc(1 −cos θ) ,
where λf and λi are the ﬁnal and initial wavelengths of the light, respectively, and m is the
mass of the electron. The Compton effect strongly suggests that light quanta – photons – of
wavelength λ carry momentum h/λ as well as energy hν, for then the relationship follows from
conservation of energy and momentum. (See Prob. 2.4.) In the same year, de Broglie proposed
that if light waves could behave like particles, then particles could behave like waves. Four
years later, Davisson and Germer observed electron diffraction and conﬁrmed de Broglie’s
relation between the momentum p and the wavelength λ of a particle:
p = h/λ .

Uncertainty Relations

Quanta had arrived.
Section 1.4 notes that relativity theory resolves a paradox: electromagnetism and New-
ton’s mechanics are incompatible. The theory of relativity resolves this paradox by modifying
Newton’s mechanics. In retrospect, we see that quantum theory, too, resolves a paradox. Sta-
tistical mechanics and electromagnetism are incompatible; together, they imply the Rayleigh–
Einstein–Jeanslaw, Eq.(2.2), andaninﬁniteenergydensityU(T)forelectromagneticradiation.
This is a paradox of the third class, the class of contradictions. (See Chap. 1.) Quantum theory
resolves the paradox by modifying electromagnetism: electromagnetic radiation of frequency
ν cannot carry energy in arbitrary amounts, but only in quanta of energy hν. Together, statisti-
cal mechanics and the modiﬁed electromagnetism imply the Planck law, Eq. (2.1), and a ﬁnite
U(T). (See Prob. 2.5.)
2.3
Uncertainty Relations
Quanta behave like waves and like particles. Are they waves or particles? Whatever they are,
quanta confront us with a paradox each time we make a measurement. If quanta behave like
waves, how can we measure their position? If they behave like particles, how can we measure
their wavelength? We can live with the paradox, but it implies fundamental limits to what we
measure. Here we derive these limits informally; for a formal derivation, see Prob. 3.10 and
Sects. 5.3 and 7.3.
Consider a measurement with a microscope. A light microscope can resolve features of
small objects, up to a limit. The limit depends on the wavelength of the light. The smallest
separation ∆x that a lens can resolve in its object plane (the x-axis in Fig. 2.2) is approximately
∆x ≈λ/2 sin θ ,
where λ is the wavelength of the light and θ is half the angle subtended by the lens at the
object. (See Prob. 2.6.) So if we want to determine the position of a small object with an
accuracy ∆x, we need light of wavelength λ ≤2(∆x) sin θ. In both classical and quantum
physics, we have light of such short wavelengths. But in quantum physics, short wavelengths
correspond to quanta carrying high momenta, as Eq. (2.4) shows. A high momentum photon
scatters off the measured object and alters its momentum. Suppose we illuminate the object
from the side with light of wavelength λ = 2(∆x) sin θ. The light consists of photons of
momentum pγ = h/λ = h/2(∆x) sin θ in the x-direction. When a photon scatters off the
object we do not know in which direction it scatters, only that it reaches the lens (if it is at all
relevant to the measurement); thus all that we know about its ﬁnal momentum in the x-direction
is that it lies between −pγ sin θ and pγ sin θ, i.e. between −h/2∆x and h/2∆x. The photon
alters the momentum of the object by this uncertain amount, hence the measurement of the
object’s position along the x-axis leaves us uncertain about its momentum in the x-direction;
the uncertainty ∆px in its momentum is at least ∆px ≥h/∆x. In particular, we cannot rely
on a prior measurement of momentum for predicting the future position of the object. This is
the meaning of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation [4]:
∆x∆px ≥h .

Equation (2.5) is revolutionary. Consider, for example, an atom of hydrogen. Its radius is
roughly the Bohr radius a0 = 0.53 ˚A (that is, 5.3 ×10−9 cm); its ionization energy is 13.6
electron volts (eV). Suppose we measure the position of the electron to better than the Bohr
radius, i.e. ∆x < 5.3 × 10−9 cm. According to Eq. (2.5), our position measurement entails
uncertainty in the electron’s momentum of at least
∆p > h/∆x ≈1.25 × 10−18g cm/sec .
We might estimate the kinetic energy of the electron after the position measurement to be
(∆p/2)2/2m ≈(6 × 10−19g cm/sec)2/2 × (9.1 × 10−28g)
(2.6)
≈2 × 10−10erg ≈130eV ,
where m≈9.1 × 10−28 g is the mass of the electron. This kinetic energy is greater than
the ionization energy, so the attempt to locate the electron within the atom ionizes the atom!
Actually, we have overestimated the kinetic energy,2 but any attempt to localize the electron
to a well deﬁned orbit within the hydrogen atom will indeed ionize the atom.
We obtained Eq. (2.5) from an experiment with a microscope, but Eq. (2.5) holds for any
measurement of position and momentum. We always ﬁnd that conditions for a precise mea-
surement of x conﬂict with conditions for a precise measurement of p. The conﬂict illustrates
2A good estimate of the kinetic energy is (ℏ/∆x)2/2m ≈14 eV.

trons enter from the left in the direction of the arrow.
Magniﬁcation shows dots making up the interference

Bohr’s principle of complementarity: measurements of canonically conjugate variables (such
as x and p) impose conﬂicting conditions. The more an experiment fulﬁlls the conditions for
measuring one variable, the less it fulﬁlls the conditions for measuring the conjugate variable.
When we quantify the complementarity between the measurements, we obtain Eq. (2.5) (and
analogous uncertainty relations for other pairs of conjugate variables).
Complementarity allows us to live with paradox, but the paradox remains. Particles and
waves are complementary pictures of quanta. Each picture contains a part of the truth; but
there is no picture uniting the wave and particle pictures. Indeed, they contradict each other.
Consider a beam of electrons impinging on three screens. (See Fig. 2.3.) The ﬁrst screen has
only one slit. The second screen has two slits, separated by a distance d. The distance between
the two screens is much larger than d, so waves passing through the ﬁrst screen and arriving
at the two slits of the second screen have effectively parallel wave vectors. The waves passing
through the two slits interfere, producing a pattern of alternating light and dark bands on the
third screen, a distance L from the second. The spacing between adjacent dark bands is D.
This is the familiar phenomenon of wave interference, with
D ≈λL/d ,
(2.7)
if the wavelength is λ. What is new is that the electrons are not simply waves. They also
behave like particles. If the beam intensity drops until only one electron passes through the
apparatus at a time, the pattern of light and dark bands still appears. The light and dark bands
emerge from marks that appear one by one on the screen, even when the time interval between
successive marks is longer than the time of ﬂight of an electron through the apparatus [5].
2.4
The Clock-in-the-Box Paradox
The double-slit experiment ﬁgured in the Bohr-Einstein debate on whether quantum theory
is consistent. Einstein saw in it a paradox. Suppose we prepare the middle screen with no
transverse momentum, and measure its transverse momentum after an electron passes through
it. (See Fig. 2.4(a).) By measuring the recoil of the screen after the electron passes, we can
infer through which slit it passed. Let us denote the electron’s ﬁnal transverse momentum by
p(L)
⊥
if the electron passes through the left slit and by p(R)
⊥
if it passes through the right slit.
(See Fig. 2.4(b).) If the electron passes through the left slit and arrives at point P, the middle
screen must acquire momentum −p(L)
⊥
to conserve momentum; if it passes through the right

slit on its way to P, the middle screen acquires momentum −p(R)
⊥. Thus we can determine
through which slit the particle passed by measuring the ﬁnal momentum of the middle screen.
How can there be an interference pattern? This is a paradox of the ﬁrst class, an error. Bohr
resolved the paradox by applying the uncertainty relations consistently. If we measure the
momentum ps of the screen with an accuracy ∆ps, then any simultaneous measurement of the
position xs of the screen entails an uncertainty ∆xs such that
∆xs ≥h/∆ps .
(2.8)
How well do we need to measure ps? We want to detect whether a particle that arrives at P
came via the left slit or the right one. In order to determine through which slit the electron
passes, we must measure ps to accuracy ∆ps better than p(R)

large compared to the transverse momentum). Thus
∆ps < d
L(h/λ) .
(2.9)

2.4
The Clock-in-the-Box Paradox
19
From Eqs. (2.7–9) we obtain ∆ps < h/D and thus ∆xs > D.
The uncertainty in the
transverse position xs of the screen, arising from an accurate enough measurement of its
transverse momentum ps, is the distance D between successive dark bands in the interference
pattern. We cannot position the slits themselves more precisely than D, so the interference
pattern is completely washed out. So when we can determine the electron path, no interference
pattern remains. According to Bohr, this resolution saves us from the paradoxical conclusion
that the behavior of an electron depends on the presence of a slit through which it did not pass.
Einstein posed a more subtle paradox during the sixth Solvay conference in 1930: his
“clock-in-the-box paradox” seemed to violate the uncertainty relation for energy and time,
∆E∆t ≥h .
(2.10)
(See Prob. 2.8.) Imagine a box that emits a photon; a clock in the box determines the emission
time. (See Fig. 2.5.) The box hangs from a spring scale which measures its weight. Its weight
is proportional to its rest mass m, hence to its energy E, according to Einstein’s formula
E = mc2. Einstein argued as follows: Suppose we wait for the box to settle down and make
an accurate initial reading of the scale. This reading can be as slow and accurate as we like.
After the photon leaves the box, we make a ﬁnal reading of the scale, again as accurate as we
like, and from the difference between the two readings we get an accurate measurement of the
energy of the emitted photon. On the other hand, the clock in the box tells exactly when the
photon was released, so we violate Eq. (2.10). Rosenfeld, who was soon to become Bohr’s
assistant, described Bohr’s reaction to this argument: “It was quite a shock for Bohr to be
faced with this problem; he did not see the solution at once. During the whole evening he was
extremely unhappy, going from one to the other and trying to persuade them that it couldn’t
be true, that it would be the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn’t produce any
refutation . . . The next morning came Bohr’s triumph and the salvation of physics . . . .” [6].

How to Weigh a Quantum
Bohr triumphed as follows. Let x denote the position of the pointer on the scale and
p its momentum, with ∆x and ∆p the corresponding uncertainties. Once we choose ∆x,
Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation bounds ∆p from below:
h
∆x ≤∆p .
(2.11)
Bohr assumed a standard procedure for weighing the photon: After the photon emission, the
pointer moves (higher on the scale). By hanging little weights on the box, we lower it to its
original position. When it has returned to its original height, the total weight hanging from it
equals the weight of the emitted photon. However, the accuracy of this weighing is no better
than the smallest added weight g∆m that has an observable effect. If we add a mass ∆m and
wait a time t, the impulse delivered to the box cannot be greater than (g∆m)t, which must be
greater than ∆p to be observable. Thus we have
∆p < gt∆m .
(2.12)
From Eqs. (2.11–12) we obtain h ≤∆x∆p < gt∆x∆m. Using ∆E = c2∆m (because
we infer the energy of the photon from the change in mass of the box) we obtain
h < gt∆x∆E
c2
.
(2.13)
Still, Eq. (2.13) does not resolve Einstein’s paradox, for ∆E is paired with ∆x instead of ∆t.
Einstein assumed that the reading of the pointer could take unlimited time. But Bohr applied
a result from Einstein’s own theory of general relativity. According to the time-dilation formula
of general relativity, a clock in a gravitational ﬁeld ticks more slowly than a clock in free fall.
Two clocks at different heights above the Earth will run at different rates, because of their
gravitational potential difference. If the difference in height is ∆x, the fractional difference
∆t/t in their measured times will be
∆t
t
= g∆x
c2
.
(2.14)
We can also let ∆x and ∆t in Eq. (2.14) denote uncertainties; if ∆x is the uncertainty in the
vertical position of a clock, then ∆t is the uncertainty in the clock time due to the uncertain
gravitational potential. Over a period t, the uncertainty in the time of the clock amounts to
∆t = tg∆x/c2 .
Combining this result with Eq. (2.13) we obtain
∆t∆E > h ,
as required by quantum theory. Bohr’s triumph is impressive – and also, at ﬁrst glance, spooky.
How does quantum theory know about general relativity? The answer is simple. To measure
the mass of the box and its contents, we weigh it. But energy is equivalent to inertial mass. We
weigh the gravitational mass. By assuming them to be equal, we have assumed the principle
of equivalence, one of the axioms of general relativity. This axiom and the equivalence of mass
and energy imply the time-dilation relation of general relativity, Eq. (2.14). (See Prob. 2.9.)

From Inconsistency to Incompleteness
The clock-in-the-box paradox was a turning point in Einstein’s criticism of quantum theory.
Before, he invested his efforts in proving that quantum theory is inconsistent. These efforts
failed; the clock-in-the-box paradox, too, belongs to the class of errors. After the Solvay con-
ference, Einstein stopped trying to prove the inconsistency of quantum theory, and instead tried
to prove that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Einstein’s efforts to prove the incompleteness
of quantum theory led him to a paradox, the paradox of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR),
which opens the next chapter. Unlike the clock-in-the-box paradox, the EPR paradox was not
resolved overnight; it has taken decades to unravel.

the box emits a photon at a time t determined by a clock in the box. If m is the mass
of the box and its contents, then the energy E of the photon equals the change in mc2.
Suppose we measure p, the momentum of the box on the horizontal part of the track,
and y, its height at rest on the inclined part, before and after the emission. Then we can
determine m by equating the kinetic energy p2/2m and potential energy mgy of the
box:
m = p/(2gy)1/2
Show how the uncertainty relation ∆E∆t ≥h applies to this experiment.

3 Is Quantum Theory Complete?
In quantum theory, every measurement entails a choice. If we choose to measure one observable
(physical variable), we choose not to measure some other observable. In confronting us with
thesechoicesquantumtheoryisconsistent, butdoesquantumtheoryprovideacompleteaccount
of all that we observe? Is quantum theory perhaps incomplete?
The title of a paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [1] (EPR) asks this question. So
does the title of a reply by Bohr [2]. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen considered the possibility
of a complete theory. Such a theory, they claimed, must represent both the position and the
momentum of a particle at any time, with arbitrary accuracy. Quantum theory does not; hence,
quantum theory is incomplete.
The next section presents the EPR claim that quantum theory is incomplete. Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen believed a complete theory to be possible, although they did not show
how to complete the theory. Is there such a complete theory? This question has a remarkable
answer – one which Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Bohr did not anticipate.
3.1
The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen Paradox
Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used quantum mechanics in their paper. But the mathematical
formalism is not necessary. Here we present the EPR paradox without the formalism, just as
Bohr did in his reply to the EPR paper.
Suppose two particles that once interacted are now apart and no longer interact. Since they
do not interact, a measurement on one particle does not affect the other particle. But since they
interacted in the past, a measurement on one particle may be an indirect measurement on the
other particle. For example, we can measure the position of a particle indirectly. In Fig. 3.1, a
pair of massive particles approaches a board with two slots in it, a distance L apart. Suppose
that the particles pass through the board through different slots, at the same time. (It may be
unlikely that they pass through the two slots, but we can try many times until two particles do
pass through the two slots simultaneously.) In this way we establish that the vertical distance
between two particles, as they pass through the board, is L. Now we measure the height of
one of the particles right after they pass through the board. We indirectly measure the height
of the other particle, too, without affecting it.
We can combine the position measurement with a momentum measurement. Consider
measurements of position and momentum along the vertical axis (x-axis) in Fig. 3.2. Particles
arrive at the board in pairs, as in Fig. 3.1; let x1 and p1 denote the position and momentum
components of one particle, and x2 and p2 the position and momentum components of the

other. We arrange that initially, p1 = p2 = 0; the initial momenta are horizontal. Also, before
and after each pair arrives at the board, we accurately measure the momentum component of
the board itself. Since the total momentum of the particles and the board remains constant
during the passage, this experiment yields the total momentum p1 + p2 of the particles after
they pass through the board (even if they knock against the slots as they pass through). It also
yields the vertical distance x2 −x1 between the particles as they pass through the board (if
they pass through the two slots). Right after they pass through the board, we can indirectly
measure either the position or momentum of one particle in a pair without affecting it. For
example, from a direct measurement of x1 we can infer x2 and from a direct measurement of
p1 we can infer p2.

The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen Paradox

The measurements in this thought experiment do not contradict the uncertainty relations.1
We measure the momentum of the board, but we never have to measure the position of the
board. We prepare pairs of particles for which p1 and p2 vanish initially, but we assume nothing
about x1 and x2 initially. Bohr showed, however, that the EPR experiment confronts us with
a choice between complementary measurements. We can measure x1 and infer x2 from the
result. However, measuring x1 may affect p1. After measuring x1, we cannot measure p1
and infer p2 from the result. Alternatively, we can measure p1 and infer p2 from the result.
However, measuring p1 may affect x1; after measuring p1, we cannot measure x1 and infer x2
from the result. We could also measure p2 indirectly and x2 directly. But the x2 measurement
affects p2 just as it does when we measure p2 and x2 directly. Thus ∆x2 and ∆p2 satisfy the
same uncertainty relation whether we measure x2 or p2 directly or indirectly.
So once again, Bohr showed that quantum theory is consistent. But is quantum theory
complete? Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen did not claim that quantum theory is, or is not,
consistent; they claimed that quantum theory is not complete. Let us consider the EPR claim.
We return to the thought experiment. Suppose we prepare a pair of particles with x2−x1 =
L. If the board does not recoil up or down, then we also have p1 + p2 = 0. Next we measure
p2 and either x1 or p1. By assumption, the particles do not interact, so the result of the p2
measurement cannot depend on whether we measure x1 or p1. What is p2? If we measure p1
and obtain p1 = p, we also obtain p2 = −p because p1 + p2 = 0. If we measure x1 we cannot
measure p1, and quantum theory does not predict the result of the p2 measurement. But the
result of the p2 measurement cannot depend on whether we measure x1 or p1, by assumption.
Hence we must still obtain p2 = −p, i.e. some predetermined result independent of what we
measure on the other particle (and which particle we measure ﬁrst). Since quantum theory
does not predict this result, quantum theory is incomplete. This is the EPR claim.
The EPR claim is a paradox for quantum uncertainty. Let two observers, Alice and Bob,
prepare a pair of particles with x2 −x1 = L and p1 + p2 = 0 where L is very large. Next
Alice, located near one particle, measures either x1 or p1; Bob, located near the other particle,
measuresp2. Theychooseindependentlywhattomeasureandtheirmeasurementsarespacelike
separated. Later they may meet and compare their results, but the experiment is over once they
complete their measurements. In some inertial reference frame, Alice measures ﬁrst. She
measures either the position or the momentum of her particle. If Alice measures momentum,
Bob’s uncertainty about the momentum of his particle (before he measures it) is subjective,
according to Alice. If Alice measures position, Bob’s uncertainty about the momentum of
his particle (before he measures it) is objective, according to the uncertainty relations. But
in another frame, Bob measures ﬁrst, and we cannot distinguish subjective from objective
uncertainty.
Does the EPR claim have implications for experiment? We might well wonder. Pauli,
writing to Born in 1954, expressed doubt: “As O. Stern said recently, one should no more rack
one’s brain about the problem of whether something one cannot know anything about exists
all the same, than about the ancient question of how many angels are able to sit on the point of
a needle. But it seems to me that Einstein’s questions are ultimately always of this kind” [3].
1Formally, we have [x2 −x1, p1 + p2] = 0, so the uncertainty relations do not constrain simultaneous measure-
ments of x2 −x1 and p1 + p2. (See Prob. 3.10.)

Yet Pauli was wrong; the EPR claim is testable! Ten years later, Bell discovered that the EPR
claim implicitly contradicts predictions of quantum mechanics.
3.2
Polarized Photons
If we replace the position and momentum measurements in the EPR thought experiment with
spin or polarization measurements, it becomes a practical experiment. Bohm reformulated the
EPR paradox for such an experiment [4]. At one stroke he confronted the EPR claim with
experiment and with quantum theory. In this section we discuss polarization in classical and
quantum theory; in Sect. 3.4 we present Bohm’s formulation and apply it – as Bell did – to
show that the EPR claim contradicts predictions of quantum mechanics.
Figure 3.3 shows two polarizers – disks of polaroid or another polarizing material – with
a common axis of rotation. Light from a lamp or the sun shines on the ﬁrst polarizer, through
a pinhole on the axis; some of this light passes through the polarizers. What happens if we
rotate one polarizer with respect to the other? Experiment shows a change in the intensity of
light passing through the polarizers. Each polarizer has a pass axis, and the second polarizer
passes a fraction cos2(θ−θ′) of the light that passes the ﬁrst polarizer, where θ−θ′ is the angle
between their pass axes. What accounts for this effect? Let us ﬁrst consider the classical, and
then the quantum, account.
In classical theory, light is an electromagnetic wave. Like any electromagnetic wave, light
is either monochromatic or a superposition of monochromatic waves; a monochromatic wave
has a propagation vector k (which ﬁxes the angular frequency ω = c|k| of the wave) and
a polarization (which ﬁxes the direction of the electric ﬁeld E(x, t)). Since there are two
independent directions for E – which must be perpendicular to k – there are two independent
polarizations. Let unit vectors ϵ1 and ϵ2, with ϵ1 · ϵ2 = ϵ1 · k = ϵ2 · k = 0, represent the two
(linear) polarizations. Then the electric ﬁeld of a monochromatic wave is a superposition
E(x, t) = E1ϵ1 cos(k · x −ωt + φ1) + E2ϵ2 cos(k · x −ωt + φ2)
(3.1)
with real phases φ1, φ2 and coefﬁcients E1, E2. Without loss of generality we can take
|φ2 −φ1| ≤π/2.

Figure 3.4: The electric ﬁeld E(x, t) of Eqs. (3.1–2)
traces out an ellipse at each point x.
If φ1 = φ2, the polarization is linear. Otherwise, the polarization is elliptic. A special
case of elliptic polarization is circular polarization: |E1| = |E2| and φ1 −φ2 = ±π/2. (See
Fig. 3.4.) Now a polarizer passes only the component of E that is parallel to its pass axis; hence
light that passes through a polarizer is linearly polarized. Let us represent the polarization of the
light passing through the ﬁrst polarizer as a unit vector P = P1ϵ1 +P2ϵ2 = cos θ ϵ1 +sin θ ϵ2
parallel2 to E. Of this light, only the component parallel to P′ = P ′
1ϵ1 + P ′
2ϵ2 = cos θ′ϵ1 +
sin θ′ϵ2 passes through the second polarizer. So the second polarizer reduces the amplitude of
E by P · P′ = P1P ′
1 + P2P ′
2 = cos(θ −θ′) and reduces the intensity (which is proportional to
the amplitude squared) by cos2(θ −θ′). The experiment in Fig. 3.3 shows the effect of linear
polarization.
Now what happens if we reduce the incident light intensity? Classical theory predicts, and
experiment conﬁrms, that the same fraction of light, cos2(θ −θ′), passes the second polarizer,
whatever the incident light intensity. But what if we reduce the incident light intensity until the
energy of the light passing through the polarizers is roughly ℏω = hν? According to quantum
theory, the incident light consists of photons of energy ℏω. (See Eq. (2.3).) Hence only one
photon passes through a polarizer at a time. This photon either does or does not pass the second
polarizer. It cannot split into a part that passes the polarizer and a part that does not, because
its angular frequency ω, and therefore its energy ℏω, cannot change as it passes through the
polarizer. So cos2(θ −θ′) must be the probability that a photon arriving at the second polarizer
will pass through it.
We can generalize this experiment by using birefringent panes [5]. It is convenient to
express E(x, t) as the real part of a complex wave [6]:

Because electric ﬁelds add as vectors, the polarizations E1eiφ1ϵ1 and E2eiφ2ϵ2 add as vectors,
even when they are complex. Equation (3.2) allows us to represent the polarization of an

where E = (E2

of polarizations, while P, ϵ1, ϵ2, denote vectors in the real vector space of directions perpen-
dicular to k. Now a birefringent pane has an optic axis, and it shifts the relative phase between
polarization components (i.e. between the component parallel to the optic axis and the com-
ponent perpendicular to it) by an amount that depends on the thickness of the pane. By placing
birefringent panes on either side of a polarizer, we can make it select (pass) monochromatic
light with arbitrary polarization. We have a selector for arbitrary polarizations, not just linear
polarizations. Figure 3.5 shows two such selectors. Suppose the ﬁrst selector selects light of
polarization |P⟩and the second selector selects light of polarization |P′⟩. What fraction of
light passing the ﬁrst selector also passes the second selector? Prob. 3.2 shows that the fraction
is
|⟨P|P′⟩|2 ,

ton will certainly pass through the selector. If |P⟩is orthogonal to |P′⟩, i.e. ⟨P|P′⟩= 0,
the photon will certainly not pass. In general, |P⟩is a complex superposition of |P′⟩and
the orthogonal polarization, and a fraction |⟨P|P′⟩|2 of the photons that pass through the ﬁrst
selector also pass through the second selector. When the polarizations |P⟩and |P′⟩are linear,
Eq. (3.3) reduces to cos2(θ −θ′).

pane then converts the linear polarization back to the original elliptical
polarization by restoring the relative phase φ2 −φ1.

Quantum States and Observables

Quantum States and Observables
Photon polarization illustrates a correspondence between quantum states and measurements.
The polarization |P⟩is an example of a quantum state in a two-dimensional complex vector
space – Hilbert space. The Hilbert space is two-dimensional, because if a photon arrives at a
polarizer, there are two possible outcomes: the photon either does or does not pass through the
polarizer. A measurement may have more than two possible outcomes. Section 3.4 considers
measurements on pairs of photons. Each photon in a pair arrives at a polarizer and either does
or does not pass through. There are four mutually exclusive answers to the question, “Do the
two photons pass through the polarizers?” Thus polarization states of two photons are vectors
in a four-dimensional Hilbert space; a basis for this space is |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩, |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩, |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩
and |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩, where the ﬁrst state in each product represents one photon and the second state
represents the other. The Hilbert space of a quantum system has dimension N if a complete
measurement on the system has N possible outcomes.
This correspondence between quantum states and measurements follows the principle of
complementarity. There are only two basis vectors for the polarization state of a photon,
because an experiment can select only one (and reject only one) polarization at a time. There
are inﬁnitely many basis vectors for the position of a particle, because an experiment that selects
one position rejects inﬁnitely many other positions. (See Prob. 3.9.) But there are no additional
basis vectors for the momentum of the particle, because the principle of complementarity allows
us to measure either the position or the momentum of a particle accurately. There are basis
vectors for momentum, but they are superpositions of the basis vectors for position (and vice
versa). Incompatible measurements on a system correspond to incompatible bases for the
Hilbert space of the system.
By measuring an observable A on a system, we choose a basis of states. Let us denote the
basis states |i⟩, where i = 1, . . . , N for an N-dimensional Hilbert space, and take ⟨i|j⟩= δij
– the basis is orthonormal. (See Prob. 3.5.) The correspondence with A is that if the system
is in a state |i⟩, a measurement of A yields an outcome ai with certainty. 3 All other possible
states |ψ⟩of the system are linear combinations of the |i⟩with complex coefﬁcients ci,
|ψ⟩=

i
ci|i⟩,
with the constraint 
i c∗
i ci = 1, just as any polarization vector is a linear combination of |ϵ1⟩
and |ϵ2⟩with complex coefﬁcients satisfying the same constraint. The scalar product of two
states |ψ⟩and |ψ′⟩, denoted ⟨ψ|ψ′⟩, is the generalization of ⟨P|P′⟩to Hilbert spaces of more
than two dimensions. That is, if |ψ′⟩is
|ψ′⟩=

i
c′
i|i⟩,
then the scalar (or inner) product of |ψ⟩and |ψ′⟩is
⟨ψ|ψ′⟩=

3If A is degenerate, i.e. if ai = aj for some i ̸= j, we also measure a nondegenerate observable on |i⟩and |j⟩
for a complete measurement.

32

Is Quantum Theory Complete?
The square of the absolute value of ⟨ψ|ψ′⟩is the probability that a measurement on a system
in the state |ψ⟩will show it to be in the state |ψ′⟩(or vice versa), just as |⟨P|P′⟩|2 represents
the probability that a measurement on a photon with polarization |P⟩will show it to have
polarization |P′⟩(or vice versa).
Now consider an experiment in which we prepare a system in a state |ψ⟩and measure A.
With probability |⟨ψ|i⟩|2 the measurement leaves the system in a state |i⟩and the measured
value of A is ai. (The constraint 
i c∗
i ci = 1 insures that the probabilities |⟨ψ|i⟩|2 sum to 1.)
If we repeat this experiment (the preparation and the measurement) many times, the average
measured value of A will be

ai|⟨ψ|i⟩|2 ,
which we can write ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩by deﬁning a linear Hermitian operator A:
A =

i
ai|i⟩⟨i| .
(3.4)
All observables of quantum theory are linear Hermitian operators. (See Probs. 3.3–4.) We
call ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩the expectation value of A in the state |ψ⟩, letting A denote both the physical
variable and its operator. Applying A to the state |j⟩we ﬁnd
A|j⟩= aj|j⟩;
|j⟩is an eigenstate (or eigenvector) of A with eigenvalue aj.

Bell’s Inequality
A pion at rest decays into two photons. The photons ﬂy off in opposite directions, with equal
and opposite momenta. What is their polarization state? It must be a linear combination of
the four basis vectors |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩, |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩, |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩and |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩, but which linear
combination? The same question arises for the annihilation of a positron and an electron into
two photons in the decay of positronium, and for the emission of photon pairs in an atomic
cascade. Experiment shows that the polarization state of photons from pion or positronium
decay is

Wechoose|Ψ1⟩, |Ψ2⟩, |Ψ3⟩and|Ψ4⟩asanorthonormalbasis(ratherthan |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩, |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩,
|ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩and |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩) for two reasons. First, |Ψ1⟩and |Ψ3⟩, but not |Ψ2⟩or |Ψ4⟩, are
invariant under rotations around the axis of symmetry – the axis along which the photons
propagate. (See Prob. 3.7.) Therefore, the polarization state of the photons must be either
|Ψ1⟩or |Ψ3⟩. Second, the parity of the state |Ψ1⟩is odd, while the parity of the states |Ψ2⟩,
|Ψ3⟩and |Ψ4⟩is even. (See Prob. 3.8.) Pions and positronium have odd parity and decay by
emitting photons in the polarization state |Ψ1⟩.
The scalar product of |Ψ1⟩with |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩or |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩vanishes; hence in the state
|Ψ1⟩, the photons have opposite polarizations. In the state |Ψ3⟩, which could arise from an
atomic cascade, the photons have the same polarization, because the scalar product of |Ψ3⟩with
|ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩or |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩vanishes. These correlations hold even if we rotate the polarization
axes from ϵ1, ϵ2 to ϵ1′, ϵ2′,

Equations (3.8–9) are just what rotational symmetry demands. An experiment in 1949 ﬁrst
checked and conﬁrmed the anticorrelated polarizations of photons pairs from pion or positro-
nium decay [7]. The experiment ruled out a model, suggested by Einstein, in which the state
|Ψ1⟩decays spontaneously to |ϵ1⟩⊗|ϵ2⟩or |ϵ2⟩⊗|ϵ1⟩(with equal probability) as the photons
ﬂy off [8]. Later experiments checked and conﬁrmed the correlated polarizations of photon
pairs emitted in an atomic cascade. How does the EPR claim apply to these experiments?
Let Alice and Bob help us with the measurements again. Pairs of photons ﬂy off from an
atomic cascade, with one photon in each pair arriving at Alice’s polarizer and the other arriving
at Bob’s polarizer. After each arrival, Alice and Bob reset the pass axes of their polarizers.
They may reset the pass axes at random, from a ﬁnite list of settings, or according to a common
plan. Either way, they ﬁnd that when the pass axes of their polarizers are parallel, both photons
in each pair pass the polarizers, or both do not; when the pass axes are at right angles, only one
photon in each pair passes a polarizer. Suppose that Bob sets the pass axis of his polarizer to
ϵ1. If Alice sets the pass axis of her polarizer to ϵ1, and a photon passes through, the photon
arriving at Bob’s polarizer also passes through. If Alice does not set the pass axis of her
polarizer to either ϵ1 or ϵ2, quantum theory does not predict whether the photon that arrives
at Bob’s polarizer passes through. What would Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen say? The result
of Bob’s measurement cannot depend on what Alice measures. Hence the photon arriving at
Bob’s polarizer must pass through anyway. Quantum theory is incomplete, because quantum
theory fails to predict that the photon must pass through.

34

Is Quantum Theory Complete?
Indeed, EPR would claim that quantum theory is hopelessly incomplete. The conclusion
that holds when the pass axis of Bob’s polarizer is ϵ1 holds for any setting of his polarizer.
Similarly, it holds for any setting of Alice’s polarizer. Hence a complete theory must predict
the result of any polarization measurement by either Alice or Bob. But the photons cannot
anticipate what Alice and Bob will measure, so the EPR claim implies that every pair of
photons arrives at Alice’s and Bob’s respective laboratories with a complete – i.e. inﬁnite –
list of results, one for each measurement that Alice and Bob might make. Still, the EPR claim
seems as untestable as Bishop Berkeley’s claim that a tree does not fall if no one sees it fall.
In 1964, however, Bell published a remarkable paper that showed, in effect, how to test
whether unseen trees fall [9]. He showed that the EPR claim implies an inequality that some
quantum correlations do not satisfy. Bell’s paper appeared in the ﬁrst volume of a journal that
folded almost immediately. Moreover his test, involving electron spin, was not practical at the
time. But ﬁve years later, Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt [10] (CHSH) generalized Bell’s
inequality; the CHSH inequality, applied to photon polarization, allows a practical test of the
EPR claim. Let us derive the CHSH inequality.
We return to Alice and Bob and their measurements. According to EPR, every pair of
photons represents a complete list of answers (results) for each pair of questions (observables)
that Alice and Bob might ask (measure). We refer to such lists as local plans; let λ denote a local
plan. Each local plan must list results for the observables that Alice and Bob may measure,
and the set of observables is inﬁnite. But let us consider just two possible observables, A and
A′, that Alice may measure, and two observables, B and B′, that Bob may measure. Let ρ(λ)
denote the relative probability that a photon pair carries a local plan λ. We normalize ρ(λ):

dλρ(λ) = 1 ,
where the integration is over all λ. Given a local plan λ, let P(A; a; λ) be the probability that
a measurement A yields the result a. Similarly, let P(A, B; a, b; λ) be the probability that
measurements A and B (on two photons) yield results a and b, respectively. The plan λ is
local, hence P(A, B; a, b; λ) factorizes:
P(A, B; a, b; λ) = P(A; a; λ)P(B; b; λ) .
(3.10)
Now let P(A, B; a, b) be the probability that measurements of A and B on a photon pair yield
a and b, respectively. It is the average of P(A, B; a, b; λ) weighted by ρ(λ), i.e.
P(A, B; a, b) =

dλρ(λ)P(A, B; a, b; λ) .
We deﬁne the correlation between measurements A and B to be
C(A, B) =

ij
aibjP(A, B; ai, bj) ,
(3.11)
where the ai and bj are possible results of measurements A and B, respectively. If A and B
are photon polarization or electron spin measurements, each has two possible results; but in

3.4
Bell’s Inequality
35
general, we let A and B have any ﬁnite number of possible results. Without loss of generality,
we assume −1 ≤ai, bj ≤1. We will prove that a combination SCHSH of correlations,
SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′) = C(A, B) + C(A′, B) + C(A, B′) −C(A′, B′) ,
is bounded above and below:
−2 ≤SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′) ≤2 .
(3.12)
To prove Eq. (3.12), we ﬁx λ and look at the sum of products

The absolute values of 
i aiP(A; ai; λ) and 
j bjP(B; bj; λ) etc. are bounded by 1. Hence
each line in Eq. (13.3) is bounded in absolute magnitude by 2. The sum of the two lines is also
bounded by 2, because (for example) if 
j bjP(B; bj; λ)+
j b′
jP(B′; b′
j; λ) has magnitude
2, then 
j bjP(B; bj; λ) −

Multiplying by ρ(λ) and integrating over λ, we obtain the CHSH inequality, Eq. (3.12):
−2 ≤C(A, B) + C(A′, B) + C(A, B′) −C(A′, B′) ≤2 .
The CHSH inequality follows from the very assumption that local results exist, whether or not
anyone measures them – that a tree falls whether or not anyone sees it fall. This reasonable
ontological assumption underlies the EPR claim.
But some quantum correlations violate the CHSH inequality. To demonstrate a violation,
we deﬁne the quantum correlation CQ(A, B) by replacing P(A, B; ai, bj) in Eq. (3.11) with
the quantum probability PQ(A, B; ai, bj):
CQ(A, B) =

Alice and Bob measure linear polarizations in the plane of ϵ1 and ϵ2, with an angle θAB
between the pass axes of A and B; let the values 1 and −1 correspond to a photon passing
or not passing, respectively. We can obtain CQ(A, B) as follows. Suppose Bob’s measure-
ment yields 1, i.e.
his photon passes his polarizer.
The photons in each pair are corre-
lated, hence Alice’s photon is polarized parallel to Bob’s. Then from Sect. 3.2 we infer that
the probability that Alice’s photon passes her polarizer is cos2 θAB. By rotational symme-
try, we have PQ(A, B, 1, 1) = (cos2 θAB)/2 = PQ(A, B, −1, −1) and PQ(A, B, −1, 1) =
(sin2 θAB)/2 = PQ(A, B, 1, −1). Then CQ(A, B) = cos2 θAB −sin2 θAB = cos 2θAB. In

violates the CHSH inequality, as we set out to demonstrate. Quantum correlations are nonlocal;
they cannot arise from local plans.
An experimental test of the CHSH inequality, by Aspect, Dalibard, and Roger [11], mea-
sured correlations along the polarization axes of Fig. 3.6. The source of the photon pairs was
an atomic cascade. In this experiment, the measurement settings switched pseudorandomly
between A and A′ and between B and B′ in a time short compared to the time of ﬂight of
the photons. The correlations in this experiment were consistent with quantum correlations
and violated the CHSH inequality by ﬁve standard deviations. In a more recent experiment
by Wiehs et al. [12] the switching between these measurement settings was truly random and
spacelike separated; the measured correlations violated the CSHS inequality by 30 standard
deviations.
There are many extensions of Bell’s inequality. Greenberg, Horne, and Zeilinger [13]
(GHZ) found a remarkable extension involving three particles. (See Prob. 3.13.) The EPR
paradox arises generically for any entangled state – any state of macroscopically separated
systems that is not a product of states of each system. Any entangled state yields quantum
correlations that violate a generalization of Bell’s inequality [14].
3.5
Paradox and Beyond
The EPR claim assumes that Bob and Alice measure independent physical variables. Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen never anticipated that this reasonable assumption would prove inconsistent
with experiment, that we cannot quite isolate systems in an entangled state from each other.
But we cannot. As Bell put it, “The reasonable thing just doesn’t work” [15].

Ironically, the claim that quantum theory is incomplete may well be correct, though not in
the EPR sense. Quantum theory does not explain how we go from probability to observation,
from possibility to actuality, as a complete theory would. There is such a complete theory,
due to Bohm [16]. (See Prob. 9.3.) Bohm’s theory is equivalent to quantum mechanics in
its experimental predictions, but contains additional “hidden” variables that account for the
results of every measurement. In keeping with Bell’s inequality, these hidden variables are not
local; so Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen would not have accepted them. But Bohm’s theory is a
complete quantum theory. Section 18.3 proposes ﬁnal boundary conditions on the universe as
a way to complete quantum theory. The hidden variables of this complete theory are nonlocal
in time.

3.1 Consider the EPR paradox of Sect. 3.1. Does a measurement of x1 affect a subsequent
measurement of p2? A measurement of x1 affects the momentum component P of the
measuring device according to the uncertainty relation ∆x1∆P ≥h. Let m2 and M
denote the masses of particle 2 and of the measuring device, respectively. Let v2 and
V = P/M denote the velocity components of particle 2 and of the measuring device,
relative to a reference frame that does not accelerate during the measurement. Relative
to the measuring device, the momentum of particle 2 is p2 = m2(v2 −V ). Show that

|Ψ3⟩and |Ψ4⟩in Eq. (3.6) are even under parity. (Parity reverses the direction of the
propagation vector k of each photon, as well as the polarization direction.)
(b) Show that Eq. (3.15) (in Prob. 3.6) is odd under parity. (Parity reverses the propa-

i, j = 1, 2, . . . . The basis states of a continuous basis satisfy an analogous condition,
but with a δ-function in place of δij. For example, δ(x −x0) represents the state of a
particle, in one space dimension, with position x = x0. We denote it |x0⟩. We think
of δ(x −x0) as vanishing everywhere outside an arbitrarily small neighborhood of x0.
Formally, we deﬁne δ(x −x0) via the integral

we have |⟨ψ|x0⟩|2 = |ψ(x0)|2 as the probability density, in the state |ψ⟩, to ﬁnd the

4 Phases and Gauges
Chapter 2 presents thought experiments in which electrons, after passing through a screen
with two slits, display an interference pattern. Einstein claimed that, if we closely observe the
recoil of the screen after each electron passes, we can determine through which slit the electron
passed, and the interference pattern will remain. Bohr, however, insisted that quantum me-
chanics is consistent only if any procedure that reveals through which slit each electron passes
also destroys the interference pattern. Bohr showed that Einstein’s procedure for observing
the recoil of the screen does, indeed, destroy the interference pattern. Since we claim that
quantum mechanics is consistent, we must be able to show that any reﬁnement or modiﬁcation
of Einstein’s procedure would also destroy the interference pattern. We now describe two
procedures, more sophisticated than Einstein’s, to reveal through which of two slits an electron
passes. Neither seems to destroy the interference pattern.
4.1
Two Paradoxical Procedures
In the ﬁrst procedure, we put a capacitor next to the screen, halfway between the two slits.
(See Fig. 4.1.) The ﬂat plates of the capacitor are perpendicular to the screen and we assume
that they are initially at rest. The plates, when charged, carry equal and opposite charges; each
plate produces a constant electric ﬁeld, perpendicular to the plates, but on either side of the
capacitor these ﬁelds cancel. Thus, on either side of the capacitor, a passing electron feels no
force. The electric ﬁeld does fringe at the edges of the plates, but if we charge the capacitor
only during the short time that the electron is on one side or the other of the capacitor, the
electron never encounters this fringe ﬁeld and never feels any force. However, the electron

pacitor between the slits. An insulated spring keeps
the plates apart.

exerts a force on the plates of the capacitor: it repels the negatively charged plate, and attracts
the positively charged plate. So it pulls the plates of the capacitor apart when it passes through
one slit, and presses them together when it passes through the other slit. The behavior of the
plates reveals through which slit the electron passed! But the plates exert no force either on
the electron1 or the screen (which is neutral). How can they affect the interference pattern?
In the second procedure a long cylinder, with a wire along its axis, takes the place of the
ﬂat plates. (See Fig. 4.2.) The wire is ﬁxed in space and the cylinder is free to rotate about
it. The wire and cylinder carry equal and opposite charges, distributed uniformly; outside the
cylinder their electric ﬁelds cancel, and once again the electron feels no electric force. The
cylinder, if it rotates, produces a magnetic ﬁeld that vanishes outside it (like the magnetic ﬁeld
of a solenoid). So the electron also feels no magnetic force. However, the electron acts upon
the cylinder. The passing electron generates a magnetic ﬁeld, and the changing magnetic ﬂux
through the cylinder induces an electric ﬁeld curling around it (by Faraday’s law). This electric
ﬁeld changes the angular speed of the cylinder, but only brieﬂy: the cylinder rotates freely with
the same angular speed ω before and after the electron passes.
Can we detect the action of the electron? The cylinder has an arrow pointing out from its
axis of rotation; it deﬁnes an angular position φ. Suppose we observe the arrow repeatedly
before the electron passes, at times t = 0, T, 2T, . . . , and ﬁnd it pointing the same direction
each time.2 After the electron passes, we again observe the arrow at a time t = nT, where n is
an integer, and ﬁnd that the arrow has shifted direction slightly by an angle δφ. A calculation
(Prob. 4.1) shows that δφ is
δφ = ±πrc2Qe
c2Il
,
(4.1)
where rc is the radius of the cylinder, Q is its charge, I is its moment of inertia and l its length.
Equation (4.1) is valid when the minimum distance of the electron from the cylinder is small
compared to l but large compared to rc. The sign of δφ depends on whether the electron passes
to the right or to the left of the cylinder. By Lenz’s law, the angular speed of the cylinder
1The plates of a capacitor conduct, so an image charge in the nearest plate attracts the electron. The attraction is
of order e2 (the electron and its image have charge ±e) hence negligible compared to the force on the plates. We
can remove this attraction by replacing the capacitor with oppositely charged, nonconducting plates; then there is no
image charge. We separate the plates only when the electron is on one side or the other of the plates, so the electron
also never encounters a fringe ﬁeld.
2We do not thereby measure the angular speed ω, for we do not know how many times the cylinder rotates during
a time T; we only know that ω must be a multiple of 2π/T. In quantum theory, the angular momentum of a freely
rotating cylinder must be a multiple of ℏ; hence ω must be a multiple of ℏ/I, where I is the moment of inertia of the
cylinder.

changes so as to cancel the magnetic ﬂux due to the electron. The behavior of the cylinder
reveals through which slit the electron passed! Yet the cylinder hardly exerts a force on the
electron or on the screen (if I is large): the electric ﬁeld due to the changing angular speed of
the cylinder is proportional to 1/I. How can the cylinder affect the interference pattern?
These two thought experiments challenge our claim that quantum mechanics is consistent.
If we cannot show that the procedures destroy the electron’s interference pattern, we must
conclude that quantum mechanics is inconsistent. We have noted the fringing of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. However, in the ﬁrst procedure we could charge the capacitor plates for a short
time only, while the electron passes near the center of the plates and is far from the edges. In
the second procedure, we can make the cylinder and wire as long as we like. Thus, we really
can neglect fringing. The resolution of this paradox is more subtle and remarkable, requiring
insight into the role of electromagnetic potentials in quantum mechanics.
4.2
Classical and Quantum Phases
Interference is familiar from the classical physics of waves, but there is a fundamental difference
between classical and quantum waves. Typical classical waves are water waves, sound waves
and light waves. Each is deﬁned by variation in space and time of a measurable quantity: the
water level, the density of a gas, the strengths of electric and magnetic ﬁelds. These quantities
deﬁne not only the length and frequency of a wave, but also its phase. By contrast, nothing that
we can measure deﬁnes the phase of a quantum wave. We can measure only phase differences.
When a light wave passes through a screen with two slits, we can determine the phase of each
partial wave emerging from the slits. When an electron passes through a screen with two slits,
we can only determine the relative phase of the two parts of the wave function emerging from
the slits. Mathematically, the quantum wave Ψ(x, t) consists of a modulus n(x, t) and a phase
ϕ(x, t), both real functions of x and t:
Ψ(x, t) = n(x, t)eiϕ(x,t) .
The probability density ρ(x, t) to ﬁnd the particle at a point x at time t is
ρ(x, t) = |Ψ(x, t)|2 = [n(x, t)]2 .
(See Prob. 3.9(b).) In interference phenomena, two partial quantum waves sum,
Ψ(x, t) = Ψ1(x, t) + Ψ2(x, t) = n1(x, t)eiϕ1(x,t) + n2(x, t)eiϕ2(x,t) ,
and the probability density depends on the relative phase ϕ1(x, t) −ϕ2(x, t):
ρ(x, t) = |n1(x, t)eiϕ1(x,t) + n2(x, t)eiϕ2(x,t)|2
= n2
1 + n2
2 + 2n1n2 cos [ϕ1(x, t) −ϕ2(x, t)] .
Thus the phase of Ψ2(x, t) relative to the phase of Ψ1(x, t) appears directly in the electron’s
interference pattern; it is not arbitrary. On the other hand, the absolute phase of the quantum
wave is arbitrary, in the following sense: if we multiply Ψ(x, t) by an overall complex phase
factor eiλ (with λ real and constant), the probability density does not change:
ρ(x, t) = |eiλΨ(x, t)|2 = |Ψ(x, t)|2 .

46
4
Phases and Gauges
Indeed, in this sense, the absolute phase of a quantum wave at each spacetime point is
arbitrary: if we multiply Ψ(x, t) by an overall complex phase factor eiλ(x,t) (with λ a real
function of x and t) the probability density does not change:
ρ(x, t) = |eiλ(x,t)Ψ(x, t)|2 = |Ψ(x, t)|2 .
We call the transformation
Ψ(x, t) →Ψ′(x, t) = eiλΨ(x, t)
(4.2)
with λ constant a global phase transformation and the transformation
Ψ(x, t) →Ψ′(x, t) = eiλ(x,t)Ψ(x, t)
(4.3)
a local phase transformation. The probability density is invariant under both. The interference
pattern is invariant under both because, at a given spacetime point (x, t), the same factor
eiλ(x,t) multiplies Ψ1(x, t) and Ψ2(x, t). But some expectation values are not invariant under
local phase transformations. For example, the components of momentum p are represented
by linear (differential) operators −iℏ∂/∂x, −iℏ∂/∂y and −iℏ∂/∂z. (See Prob. 3.9(d).) The
expectation value ⟨Ψ|p|Ψ⟩is not invariant under local phase transformations. On the other
hand, all expectation values are invariant under global phase transformations.
4.3
Phase Meets Gauge
The apparent conclusion of the previous section is that a global phase transformation, applied
to a quantum wave, yields an equivalent wave; but a local phase transformation, applied to a
quantum wave, yields (in general) an inequivalent wave. At any one point in spacetime we
can choose the phase of the wave function, but that choice ﬁxes the phase of the wave function
at every other point. Nevertheless, this conclusion is not valid if we include electromagnetic
interactions in quantum mechanics. We will now see that, at least for charged particles, the
quantum phase is arbitrary at every point in spacetime, so two quantum waves related by a
local phase transformation are indeed equivalent.
In classical physics, the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld B obey four equations –
Maxwell’s equations – which describe how each ﬁeld depends on the other and on charges
(including moving charges). A ﬁfth equation – the Lorentz force equation – describes how a
charged particle reacts to electric and magnetic ﬁelds. All the quantities appearing in these ﬁve
equations are measurable, and there are no other measurable electromagnetic quantities. Even
so, two auxiliary quantities are in common use: a scalar ﬁeld V (x, t) and a vector ﬁeld A(x, t),
which together form a four-vector. V and A completely determine E and B according to the
equations3

E and B, however, do not determine V and A. Suppose we modify V and A as follows:
V →V −1
c
∂
∂tΛ ,
A →A + ∇Λ ,
(4.5)
where Λ(x, t) is any scalar function of space and time. This modiﬁcation of V and A does
nothing to E and B, according to Eq. (4.4). Since only E and B are directly measurable, the
transformation Eq. (4.5) has no observable consequences, and V and A are to some extent
arbitrary. They are arbitrary in the same way that the quantum phase ϕ(x, t) is arbitrary: at
any spacetime point (x, t), we cannot measure their values. We can only measure (to an extent)
their spacetime dependence. For example, only the difference in V from one point in space to
another has observable consequences; V alone does not. Thus, the transformation Eq. (4.5) is
analogous to a change in the initial reading on a gauge (where the difference between ﬁnal and
initial readings yields a measurement) and is called a gauge transformation.
If V and A are somewhat arbitrary, why bother with them? One reason is that it may be
simpler to solve Maxwell’s equations for the four auxiliary quantities V and A than for the six
physical quantities E and B. An additional reason is that we may want to obtain the Lorentz
force equation (for a particle of mass m and charge e)

from a Hamiltonian. E and B cannot appear in the Hamiltonian, for a Hamiltonian containing
E and B would yield an equation of motion containing their derivatives. However, Hamilton’s
equations for a Hamiltonian in which V and A appear,

yield the Lorentz force equation, Eq. (4.6). The strongest reason for introducing V and A is
the Hamiltonian itself. The Hamiltonian – the sum of the kinetic and potential energies – is
a conserved quantity. Without the electromagnetic potentials we could not arrive at a notion
of conservation. Still, in classical mechanics we can choose either Eq. (4.7) or Eq. (4.6) as a
starting point.
In quantum mechanics we cannot choose; we must start with a Hamiltonian.4 Any quantum
state |Ψ⟩of a system satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation iℏ∂|Ψ⟩/∂t = H|Ψ⟩, where H is the
Hamiltonian operator for the system. The Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to Eq. (4.7) is

4The Hamiltonian is the starting point for both Schr¨odinger’s equation and Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. Feyn-
man’s path integral is based on the Lagrangian (in which V and A also appear); but in general the Hamiltonian is
essential for obtaining the correct path integral. (See Sect. 12.3.) Regarding a gauge-invariant form of the Schr¨odinger
equation, see Prob. 4.2.

We have written Ψ(x, t) as the solution of Eq. (4.8) and Ψ′(x, t) as the solution of Eq. (4.9)
because they are not the same wave function. Indeed,
Ψ′(x, t) = eieΛ/ℏcΨ(x, t) ;
(4.10)
we see by substitution that if Ψ(x, t) is a solution of Eq. (4.8), then Ψ′(x, t) is a solution
of Eq. (4.9). Equation (4.10) is a local phase transformation as deﬁned in Eq. (4.3), with
λ(x, t) = eΛ(x, t)/ℏc. Since Ψ(x, t) and Ψ′(x, t) have the same physical signiﬁcance, it is
apparent that the local phase transformation Eq. (4.10) does lead to an equivalent wave function,
and that the phase of a quantum wave at any point is arbitrary, since Λ(x, t) is arbitrary.
Thus, what we have called local phase transformations and gauge transformations (also
called gauge transformations of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively) go hand in hand. As
noted above, gauge transformations do not affect either probability densities or interference.
What about expectation values? We ﬁnd that all measurable quantities are gauge invariant;
gauge transformations do not affect their expectation values. For example, the velocity of a
particle with Eq. (4.7) as its Hamiltonian is

and is gauge invariant. (See Prob. 4.4.)
4.4
The Aharonov–Bohm Effect
Quantum mechanics needs V and A in a way that classical physics does not. The scalar
and vector potentials appear in Schr¨odinger’s equation, in which gauge transformations (of the
potentials) combine with local phase transformations (of the quantum wave). The fact that these
transformations go hand in hand gives the electromagnetic potentials greater signiﬁcance in
quantum physics than in classical physics. We began this chapter with two thought experiments
involving electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We now return to the two experiments and consider the
role of the electromagnetic potentials. We will ﬁnd that V and A seem to inﬂuence the electron
even where the electric and magnetic ﬁelds vanish! The ﬁrst to realize the importance of this
purely quantum effect of electromagnetic potentials, in 1959, were Aharonov and Bohm [1].
In the ﬁrst experiment, a capacitor lies midway between two passing wave packets of a
single electron.5 Brieﬂy, as they pass, we apply a potential difference to the capacitor. Let the
potential vanish on the left plate of the capacitor and equal V (t) on the right plate, and let V (t)
be zero except when the wave packets pass near the center of the plates. Thus neither wave
packet ever encounters an electric ﬁeld. (We could just as well let the potential equal −V (t) on
the left plate and vanish on the right plate; all that matters is the potential difference across the

passing to the left of the capacitor satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation

L(x, t) = −ℏ2

equation
iℏ∂
∂tΨR(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m∇2ΨR(x, t) + eV (t)ΨR(x, t) .
(4.12)
Although there is no electric ﬁeld on either side of the capacitor, we cannot eliminate the scalar
potential from both Eq. (4.11) and Eq. (4.12) because it does not vanish everywhere. We can,
however, write V (t) in Eq. (4.12) as a gauge transform of the zero potential by deﬁning
Λ = −c
 t
V (t′)dt′ ,
so that V (t) = −(1/c)∂Λ/∂t. Now suppose Ψ0
R represents the solution of Eq. (4.12) with
V (t) = 0. Then from Eq. (4.10) we obtain immediately
ΨR(x, t) = Ψ0
R(x, t)eieΛ/ℏc = Ψ0
R(x, t)e−i(e/ℏ)
 t V (t′)dt′ .
Thus the potential difference between the plates induces a phase difference between the two
wave packets. If the two wave packets arrive at the capacitor in a superposition (Ψ0

and the phase difference between the two wave packets will be observable as a shift in the
lines of the interference pattern from their position when there is no potential difference. Note,
however, that a relative phase of 2π is unobservable because one line merely takes the place
of its neighbor in the interference pattern. (See Prob. 4.7.)
Thus the capacitor shifts the electron’s interference pattern! This remarkable effect depends
on the topology of space. The space available to the electron is not simply connected. The
electron’s paths from the two slits lie on one side or the other of a region where the potential
is not constant in space. Yet along each path, the potential is constant.
In the second experiment, too, the region where the electron can go, where both electric
and magnetic ﬁelds vanish, is not simply connected. The electron is forbidden to go into the
cylinder. Although we can choose the scalar potential to vanish outside the cylinder, we cannot,
in general, choose the vector potential A to vanish everywhere outside the cylinder. If it did,

would vanish. But the integral equals the enclosed magnetic ﬂux ΦB, which is nonzero if the
cylinder rotates.
The topology common to the two experiments leads us to consider, as before, the Schr¨odin-
ger equation satisﬁed by two wave packets, ΨL(x, t) and ΨR(x, t), passing through the left and
right slits, respectively. ΨL(x, t) passes the cylinder on the left and satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger

in the region to the right of the cylinder. The left and right regions overlap where the wave
packets separate and where they recombine. (See Fig. 4.3.) To specify A, it is convenient to
use cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) with the axis of the charged cylinder deﬁning the z-axis.6
A possible choice for A in the region outside the cylinder is A = ΦBˆθ/2πr, where ˆθ is a unit
vector is the θ-direction.
For this choice of vector potential, we can write A(x, t) = (ΦB/2π)∇θ, or A = ∇Λ with
Λ = ΦBθ/2π. The coordinate θ increases by 2π with every full turn about the z-axis, and so
Λ must be multivalued in the region outside the cylinder. In this region, then, A = ∇Λ is not
a gauge transform of zero vector potential, because Λ is not a single-valued function of space
and time everywhere outside the cylinder. But the region to the left of the cylinder is simply
connected, and also the region to the right. Within each region, Λ is a single-valued function of
space and time, and A = ∇Λ is a gauge transform of zero. Thus if Ψ0
L represents the solution
to Eq. (4.13) when A = 0, we know from Eqs. (4.8–10) that the solution to Eq. (4.13) for
nonzero A is
ΨL = Ψ0
LeieΛ/ℏc = Ψ0
LeieΦBθ/2πℏc .
Similarly, if Ψ0
R represents the solution to Eq. (4.14) when A = 0, then the solution to Eq. (4.14)
for nonzero A is
ΨR = Ψ0
ReieΛ/ℏc = Ψ0
ReieΦBθ/2πℏc .
6Here for cylindrical coordinates we deﬁne r = (x2 + y2)1/2 and θ = arctan(y/x) whereas for spherical
coordinates we deﬁne r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2, θ = arccos(z/r) and φ = arctan(y/x).

(up to an overall phase), since the difference in θ between the two partial waves is 2π. The
vector potential induces a relative phase of magnitude eΦB/ℏc between the partial waves.
This relative phase shifts the interference pattern by an amount proportional to the ﬂux ΦB.
Again, only the modular part of the phase, eΦB/ℏc mod 2π, is observable. (See Prob. 4.7.)
A magnetic ﬂux inﬂuences the electron’s interference pattern even though the electron does
not pass through any magnetic ﬁeld! Experiments have conﬁrmed this shift in the interference
pattern [2].
4.5
Quantum Consistency and the Aharonov–Bohm Effect
The Aharonov–Bohm effect is the key to resolving the paradoxes presented at the beginning
of this chapter. It shows us that a capacitor or a solenoid placed between two slits can affect
the interference pattern of an electron diffracting through the two slits. We will now see how
this effect preserves the consistency of quantum mechanics.
In the ﬁrst paradoxical procedure described in Sect. 4.1, the electron’s path inﬂuences
the relative momentum of the two capacitor plates. To detect through which slit the electron
passes, we must be able to measure the relative momentum of the plates to good accuracy. But
the scalar potential between the capacitor plates is proportional to their separation. The more
accurately we measure the relative momentum of the plates, the less accurately we can measure
their relative position, and the more uncertain is the scalar potential between the plates. The
Aharonov–Bohm effect implies that an uncertain scalar potential induces an uncertain relative
phase between two paths passing on opposite sides of the capacitor, washing out the interference
pattern.
This resolution of the paradoxes is qualitatively correct. Is it quantitatively correct, too?
Let us consider how accurately we need to measure the relative momentum of the plates. If pL
and pR represent the momentum of the left and right plates, respectively, we must determine
whether the passing electron increases or decreases their relative momentum pR −pL. (The
charged plates in any case attract one another, but let us assume that we can isolate the change
in pR −pL due to the electron.) The absolute value of the change in pR −pL, then, must be
large compared to ∆(pR −pL), the accuracy with which we can measure pR −pL. It must be
large if we are to be fairly certain about which way the electron went. The change in pR −pL
is the time integral of the force, eE(t), so
|e

dtE(t)| ≫∆(pR −pL) .

52

Phases and Gauges
The relative phase between paths of the electron is (e/ℏ)

dtV (t), where V (t) is the potential
difference between the two plates at time t; V (t) is proportional to the separation xR −xL of
the plates:
V (t) = E(t)(xR −xL) .
The uncertainty in V (t) is at least |E(t)|∆(xR −xL), so the phase uncertainty is at least
∆(phase) = (e/ℏ)|

dtE(t)|∆(xR −xL) ≫∆(pR −pL)∆(xR −xL)/ℏ.
We now apply a form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation. (See Sect. 2.3.) Prob. 3.10 presents
the following theorem:
∆A∆B ≥1
2 |⟨[A, B]⟩| ,
(4.15)
where A and B are any two Hermitian operators. Since [xR −xL, pR −pL] = [xR, pR] +
[xL, pL] = 2iℏ, we have ∆(phase) ≫∆(pR −pL)∆(xR −xL)/ℏ≥1. Thus the uncertainty
in the phase is large compared to 1 and washes out the interference pattern.
The Aharonov–Bohm effect applies in a similar way to the second paradoxical procedure.
To detect which way the electron went, we must measure δφ, the change in the angular position
of the cylinder. The sign of δφ tells us which way the electron went; hence the uncertainty in
φ must not be greater than δφ. Equation (4.1) then implies
∆φ ≪πrc2Qe
c2Il
.
(4.16)
On the other hand, the rotating cylinder produces a ﬂux ΦB
ΦB = 2πrc
2QLz/Ilc ,
(4.17)
where Lz is the angular momentum of the cylinder. In accord with the Aharonov–Bohm effect,
it yields an electron phase of (e/ℏc)(2πrc2QLz/Ilc). The uncertainty in this phase is at least
∆(phase) ≥2πrc
2eQ(∆Lz)/ℏIlc2 .
(4.18)
The commutator of φ and Lz is [φ, Lz] = iℏ. (See Prob. 4.8.) Then Prob. 3.10 implies that
∆Lz∆φ ≥ℏ/2, and from Eqs. (4.16) and (4.18) we again obtain ∆(phase) ≫1. So here,
too, detecting though which slit the electron went destroys the electron interference.7
We see that the Aharonov–Bohm effect is crucial to the consistency of quantum mechanics.
Indeed, after Aharonov and Bohm predicted the effect, and while their prediction was still
controversial, Furry and Ramsey [3] formulated paradoxes similar to those of Sect. 4.1 and
applied the Aharonov–Bohm effect to resolve them, to show that the effect was not only correct,
but necessary for consistency.
7An application of modular variables shows that the phase uncertainty in both procedures is actually 2π. See
Prob. 5.3.

4.6
Flux Quantization
53
We close this section with a comment on the interpretation of the AB effect. Electromag-
netic potentials have a signiﬁcance in quantum theory that they lack in classical theory. We
might conclude that in classical theory, E and B are the only physical variables, whereas in
quantum theory, A and V are physical variables as well. But in quantum theory, as in classical
theory, only gauge-invariant quantities (such as the total ﬂux enclosed by two paths, or a dif-
ference in scalar potential) have physical meaning. Measurable quantities are gauge-invariant.
We cannot measure V and A themselves. To deﬁne them to be physical variables contradicts
the demand (in Chap. 7) for the closest possible correspondence between what theory describes
and what we can measure. (Of course, V and A are physical in that they appear in physical
equations, but they are not measurable.) Thus, instead of concluding that A and V are physical
variables in quantum mechanics, we state a conclusion that later chapters develop: Only E and
B are physical quantities, but they act nonlocally – a magnetic ﬁeld here has physical effects
on electrons there, and so on. Such action at a distance by a ﬁeld is completely nonclassical.
4.6
Flux Quantization
As a simple application of the Aharonov–Bohm effect, let us consider the energy of a particle
of charge q and mass M moving on a unit circle, when the circle encloses a solenoid. The
particle has a single degree of freedom, its angular position on the circle, which we denote θ.
The solenoid contains a magnetic ﬂux ΦB, but the particle never encounters a magnetic ﬁeld;
the ﬁeld vanishes on the circle. We obtain the energies En and corresponding basis states |ψn⟩
of the particle from the eigenvalue equation
H|ψn⟩= En|ψn⟩,
where the Hamiltonian, Eq. (4.7), reduces to
H =

in the gauge and cylindrical coordinates of Sect. 4.4. The solutions are
ψn(θ) =
1
√
2π einθ
where n is an integer; the eigenstates |ψn⟩form an orthonormal basis. The corresponding
eigenvalues are En = (nℏ−qΦB/2πc)2/2M. Any other state of the particle is a linear
combination of these basis states.8
What is striking is that the energies En = (nℏ−qΦB/2πc)2/2M depend on the magnetic
ﬂux through the circle, even though the particle on the circle never encounters the ﬂux. The
ground-state (lowest) energy of the particle is (n0ℏ−qΦB/2πc)2/2M, where n0 is the integer
nearest to qΦB/hc; it is positive unless ΦB is a multiple of hc/q.
A more realistic Hamiltonian for a charged particle contains additional degrees of freedom,
and potential as well as kinetic energy operators; hence the eigenstates are more complicated,
8The states |ψn⟩are also eigenstates of angular momentum pθ with eigenvalues nℏ.

54

Phases and Gauges
and the corresponding eigenvalues contain additional kinetic and potential energy terms. But
the eigenvalues still depend periodically on the ﬂux, and this dependence has experimental
consequences. One consequence is the quantization of ﬂux in a superconducting ring [4].
Experiments show that the ﬂux through a cylindrical superconductor is quantized in multiples
of ΦB = hc/2e. At ﬁrst, these experiments seem to contradict our assumption that we can
impose an arbitrary ﬂux ΦB in the region inaccessible to the charged particle. But what happens
is that the imposed ﬂux induces surface currents in the superconductor, circulating around the
inaccessible region. These currents round off the imposed ﬂux to a multiple of hc/2e and
thereby lower the average ground-state energy of all the particles. (The ﬂux is quantized in
multiples of hc/2e because in a superconductor the effective particles are pairs of electrons,
with charge q = 2e.)
4.7
Magnetoresistance
Figure 4.4 shows two wires, of resistances R+ and R−, connected in parallel. The familiar
formula 1/R = 1/R+ + 1/R−implies that the resistance R between the two leads in Fig. 4.4
depends only on R+ and R−. Yet the topology of Fig. 4.4 is the topology of the two-slit
experiment of Fig. 2.3: two electron paths make a closed loop. Could electrons in the two
wires interfere, like electrons in the two slits? Perhaps the resistance between the leads depends
on interference – destructive interference increases, and constructive interference decreases,
the resistance.
To answer this question, we must consider more than topology. Electrons pass through the
thought experiment of Fig. 2.3 one at a time, while the electrons in Fig. 4.4 scatter off each other
and off atoms in the conductor. Inelastic scattering changes the energy, and thus the wavelength,
of electrons in a conductor; then the spread in the wavelengths of the electrons washes out
interference. Elastic scattering, however, does not change the energy of the electrons. It may
change the phase of the electrons, but the change is the same for all electrons in the same state.
(See Prob. 6.1 for an example of elastic scattering off a wall.) If scattering of at least some
electrons in the wires is elastic, the interference should not all wash out.
The pattern of constructive and destructive interference in the two-slit experiment is pre-
dictable. It is not so easy to predict how the resistance of the loop in Fig. 4.4 should depend on
the interference of the electrons in the two wires; we can, however, predict that the resistance
must be periodic in the relative phase of the electrons. In particular, if the resistance depends
on the magnetic ﬂux through the loop, the dependence must be periodic with period hc/e, just
as the dependence of the Aharonov–Bohm phase on ﬂux is periodic with period hc/e. This

prediction is exact if the ﬂux does not touch the wires; and if the ﬂux touches the wires, but
the loop is much wider than the wires, we can still predict approximate periodicity.
The ﬁrst demonstration of electron interference in a conducting loop was a 1985 experiment
[5] on tiny gold loops (less than 1 micron in diameter) cooled to a temperature of 0.01 K (to
minimize inelastic scattering). Figure 4.5(a) shows a photograph of one of the gold loops, and
Fig. 4.5(b) shows the resistance of the loop as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The amplitude of
the oscillations was only 0.1% of the total resistance, but the period of the oscillations times the
area of the loop yielded hc/e to within the accuracy of the area measurement. This landmark
demonstration of quantum phases at “mesoscopic” distances (some 10,000 times larger than
atomic distances) was an application of the Aharonov–Bohm effect.

Non-Abelian Phases
In 1954, Yang and Mills [6] generalized the way gauges and phases transform together in the
Schr¨odinger equation. Their generalization is an important part of elementary particle physics
and other branches of physics. In the Yang-Mills construction, a wave function is a complex
vector deﬁned at each point in spacetime (rather than a complex number). We can write the

wave function as a column vector with N entries, each a complex function of x and t:

(4.19)
While before we considered multiplying Ψ(x, t) by an arbitrary phase, now we may consider
multiplying Ψ(x, t) by an arbitrary unitary matrix. Why unitary? The modulus of the complex
wave function, |Ψ(x, t)|, is invariant under a change of phase. The norm of the complex vector
Eq. (4.19), namely the square root of
|Ψ(x, t)|2 ≡|Ψ1(x, t)|2 + |Ψ2(x, t)|2 + · · · + |ΨN(x, t)|2 ,
is invariant under multiplication of Ψ(x, t) by an arbitrary unitary matrix U: |UΨ(x, t)| =
|Ψ(x, t)|.
The vector and scalar potentials appearing in the Schr¨odinger equation will now be matrices
rather than complex numbers. Like all operators representing quantum observables, they will
be Hermitian matrices. Let the transformed wave function be Ψ′(x, t) = UΨ(x, t), where
Ψ(x, t) satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation

The gauge transformations Eqs. (4.5) and (4.20) are similar, since every unitary matrix U can
be written as the exponential of a Hermitian matrix λ times i:
U = eiλ .

Problems
57
Written this way, U is the direct generalization of the phase transformation eiλ(x,t) in Eq. (4.3).
Indeed, λ(x, t) in Eq. (4.3) can be regarded as a 1-dimensional Hermitian matrix, so that the
transformations Eq. (4.5) are the simplest version of Eq. (4.20).
The ﬁeld A and others
constructed from them are known as Yang-Mills ﬁelds. Since Hermitian matrices do not
commute, in general, ﬁelds that transform according to the generalized gauge transformations
Eq. (4.20) are also called non-abelian gauge ﬁelds, after the mathematician Abel, who studied
commutative algebras. Now two wave packets of a particle can differ by a relative non-abelian
phase, even if the non-abelian gauge ﬁeld vanishes everywhere the wave packets are nonzero;
that is, a non-abelian gauge ﬁeld can produce a non-abelian Aharonov–Bohm effect [7]. Non-
abelian gauge ﬁelds appear in nature; ﬁelds transforming according to Eq. (4.20) and built out
of 2×2 and 3×3 matrices describe, respectively, the electroweak and the strong nuclear forces.
And Sect. 12.2 shows how non-abelian phases can arise even in simple quantum systems.

for all x outside two disjoint regions. Show that ρ(x, 0), J(x, 0) and Eqs. (4.21–22) do
not determine Ψ(x, t) for all times t > 0.

z-axis, and that canonical momentum p = mv−eA/c depends on the choice of gauge.
(b) Show that Hamilton’s equation of motion for Eq. (4.7) imply Eq. (4.6), and that the

4.6 Find a Lorentz-invariant expression for the Aharonov–Bohm phase that reduces to the

Previous chapters show a close relationship between quantum interference and the uncertainty
principle. The uncertainty principle implies loss of quantum interference whenever we can de-
tect through which slit a particle passes. (See Sects. 2.4 and 4.5.) Nevertheless, the relationship
between interference and the uncertainty principle remains obscure. For example, consider
partial quantum waves (of a single particle) emerging from two slits. The partial waves do not
yet overlap as they emerge from the slits. If we detect through which slit the particle passes,
we decrease the uncertainty in the particle’s transverse position. A natural guess, based on the
uncertainty relation, Eq. (2.5), is that we increase the uncertainty in the particle’s transverse
momentum. But a simple calculation (Prob. 5.1) shows that the uncertainty in the transverse
momentum does not change. Why, then, does the interference pattern disappear? We have
analyzed several detection schemes and each time applied the uncertainty principle to the de-
tector to explain the loss of interference; but applying the uncertainty principle to the particle
tells us nothing about loss of interference.
Another example of the obscure relation between interference and the uncertainty principle
is the Heisenberg formulation of quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg formalism (in which
operators evolve in time and states do not) is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger formalism; the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle falls naturally out of both formulations. Yet how can we
think about interference in the Heisenberg formalism? Without wave packets that evolve in
time, it seems impossible.
These examples suggest that we have not learned to think intuitively about interference.
Relativity theory introduced an intuitive language for describing space and time, but in quantum
theory we still describe interference as if the interfering waves were classical. This chapter
introduces a new language for describing quantum interference. We begin with a paradox
involving a lattice of solenoids. The solution to this paradox will give us new intuition about
both interference and quantum nonlocality.
5.1
A Lattice of Solenoids
Consider electrons of wavelength λ diffracting through a heavy grating, as shown in Fig. 5.1;
the grating consists of narrow slits, spaced a distance L apart, formed by parallel slats. The
electrons scatter into discrete directions deﬁned by angles θn (n an integer):
sin θn = nλ/L ;
in these directions the partial electron waves interfere constructively. Because the grating is
heavy, the energy of the electrons is practically the same before and after diffraction; hence their

momentum p = h/λ and wavelength remain the same, according to the de Broglie relation,
Eq. (2.4). If the incident electrons move parallel to the y-axis and diffract in the xy-plane, the
transverse momentum px of an electron scattered through an angle θn is
px = p sin θn = nh/L .
(5.1)
Assuming the grating is free to move in the x-direction, the x-component of momentum is
conserved during diffraction, and the grating acquires momentum nh/L in the x-direction
from the electron. Note that the electron and grating exchange transverse momentum only in
multiples of h/L. We can derive this constraint also from a perturbative calculation. Let Ψ
and Ψ′ be initial and ﬁnal electron states of momenta ℏkx and ℏk′
x, respectively. To ﬁrst order
in the perturbation, the transition probability from Ψ to Ψ′ is proportional to
⟨Ψ′|V |Ψ⟩≃
 ∞
−∞
ei(kx−k′
x)xV (x)dx ,
where V (x) is the perturbing potential. This integral is just the Fourier transform of V (x) with
respect to x. If (like the grating) V (x) is periodic in x with period L, the integral vanishes
unless ℏ(k′
x −kx) = nh/L.
Let us now modify the experiment [1]. Suppose that each slat in the grating is hollow,
and inside each slat we place a solenoid. The solenoids are rigidly connected to one another,
forming a lattice. (See Fig. 5.2.) Imagine the ends of each slat open and all the solenoids
connected above and below by a rod, while short plates connect the slats above and below. Yet
the solenoids are not connected to the grating, so the lattice of solenoids moves independently
of the grating (except for the constraint that the solenoids must stay inside the slats). As we
saw in Sect. 4.4, a solenoid carrying a ﬂux ΦB contributes eΦB/ℏc to the relative phase of
partial waves passing on either side of it. If all the solenoids carry the same ﬂux ΦB, then
electrons, after passing the grating, will scatter into a new set of angles θ′
n deﬁned by
sin θ′
n =
	
n + eΦB
2πℏc

λ/L .
(5.2)
For example, if the extra phase due to the solenoids is eΦB/ℏc = π, then the pattern of lines
of constructive interference will be shifted by half the separation between neighboring lines.

Constructive interference now corresponds to a change in the electrons’ transverse momentum

h/L .
(See Fig. 5.3.) Since diffraction of the electrons conserves total transverse momentum, we
might assume that the grating, again, picks up the transverse momentum lost by the electrons.
But, once again, the electrons and grating exchange transverse momentum only in multiples
of h/L. We obtained this constraint from a perturbative calculation with the same interaction
between the electrons and the grating. Therefore, the solenoids must absorb ±h/2L of the
transverse momentum carried by the electrons, even though there is never any contact between
the solenoids and the electrons. We can be sure that there is no contact between the solenoids
and the electrons, because we have placed the solenoids within the hollow slats of the grating.
Here, as in Sect. 4.1, we can arrange for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of each solenoid to
vanish wherever the electrons go. Thus the electrons and solenoids must exchange momentum
nonlocally. A startling effect! But could we ever observe this effect? The fact that the solenoids

must remain inside the slats implies that the uncertainty in their transverse position is less than
L. For ∆x strictly less than or equal to L, the uncertainty in px is ∆px ≥h/L. (See Prob.
5.3.) Consequently, the uncertainty in their transverse momentum cannot be less than h/L, and
there is no possibility of detecting a change in the solenoid momentum of ±h/2L. Nonlocal
exchange of momentum is apparently an unobservable (hence less than startling) effect.
Yet there is something wrong with this argument. If we send one electron through the
grating, the transverse momentum of the solenoids must change by at least h/2L in absolute
magnitude; suppose it does not change by more than that. So the solenoids pick up transverse
momentum ±h/2L. We cannot detect such a small exchange. But let us send another electron
through the grating. This electron interacts with the grating and the solenoids in the same way;
once again, the solenoids pick up transverse momentum ±h/2L. We send in a third electron;
the solenoids pick up another ±h/2L of transverse momentum. There is no reason why all
these contributions to the transverse momentum of the solenoids should add with the same
sign. But there is no reason why they should all exactly cancel. Indeed, the contributions of
the electrons to the transverse momentum should be like steps in a one-dimensional random
walk: each step is equal in size but random in direction, like the steps of a drunk who has
forgotten where he is going. After N such steps the net displacement will most likely be ±
√
N
times the step size. Thus, after we send N electrons through the grating, the solenoids are likely
to pick up ±
√
Nh/2L (or more) in transverse momentum! The uncertainty principle cannot
prevent us from observing this nonlocal exchange of momentum, which can be arbitrarily large.
The effect is not only startling, it is paradoxical. It contradicts both experiment and theory.
It is paradoxical for solenoids to accelerate without any forces acting on them; if such an
effect exists in quantum physics, then the correspondence principle implies it should exist in
classical physics as well.1 We can ignore this paradox if we cannot observe nonlocal exchanges
of momentum, but we cannot ignore what we can observe. If nonlocal exchanges of momentum
between electrons and solenoids accumulate like steps in a random walk, then they must be
observable, because a random walk diverges. We might question whether the electrons and
grating can indeed exchange transverse momentum only in multiples of h/L, since we obtained
this constraint by treating the grating to ﬁrst order as a perturbation. However, there is a simple,
exact proof of the constraint. (See Prob. 5.5.)
We close this section with a hint towards solving this paradox. A random walk on a line
diverges. A random walk on a circle does not. No point on a circle is farther than half the
circumference from any other point. This observation may seem irrelevant, because electrons
and solenoids exchange momentum, an unbounded quantity, while a circle corresponds to a
bounded and periodic quantity, such as an angle. Yet (from Sect. 4.4) what counts in the
Aharonov–Bohm effect is the modular part of the phase, e.g. eΦB/ℏc mod 2π. (See Prob.
4.7.) If the solenoids in the lattice all carry ﬂux ΦB, the transverse momentum of an electron
scattered through an angle θ′
n is (from Eq. (5.2))
px = p sin θ′
n =
	
n + eΦB
2πℏc

h/L .
1According to Bohr’s correspondence principle, the predictions of quantum physics and classical physics must
correspond in the limit of many quanta.

5.2
Non-overlapping Wave Packets
65
Since the grating can pick up transverse momentum in multiples of h/L only, the lattice of
solenoids must absorb some transverse momentum, too. All we can determine, however, is
the modular part of the transverse momentum they absorb, i.e. (n + eΦB/2πℏc) (h/L) mod
h/L. How does this quantity accumulate as the electrons diffract?
5.2
Non-overlapping Wave Packets
Section 4.2 discusses interference between two partial quantum waves Ψ1(x, t) and Ψ2(x, t).
It states that the interference pattern is invariant under a local phase transformation eiλ(x,t)
because, at a given spacetime point (x, t), the same factor eiλ(x,t) multiplies Ψ1(x, t) and
Ψ2(x, t). This statement assumes (implicitly) that interference requires the two partial waves
to meet or overlap at a spacetime point. Let us look closer at this assumption.
A partial wave emerging from a slit is localized in space. We can describe such a localized
wave as a wave packet, i.e. a superposition of waves of different wavelengths. Two kinds of
wave packets are of special interest. One is the standard minimal uncertainty wave packet (in
one space dimension), the gaussian function
ψg(x) = e−x2/2a2eikx
(πa2)1/4
,
(5.3)
peaked at x = 0, for which ∆x = a/
√
2 and ∆p = ℏ/
√
2a. (See Prob. 3.10 for the deﬁnition
of ∆x and ∆p.) This wave packet does not vanish for any x, but it decays exponentially in x.
It is relatively easy to handle mathematically; the Schr¨odinger equation for a free particle of
mass m on a line,
iℏ∂
∂tΨ(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂x2 Ψ(x, t)
has an exact solution coinciding with ψg(x) at t = 0:
Ψ(x, t) = e−iℏk2t/2m+ikxe−(x−ℏkt/m)2/2(a2+iℏt/m)
π1/4 (a + iℏt/ma)1/2
.
(5.4)
Equation (5.4) describes a wave packet peaked at x = ℏkt/m; i.e. the wave travels at average
speed p/m = ℏk/m. Another kind of wave packet is the test function ψt(x); it equals
ψt(x) =

e−1/(a2−x2)
if |x| ≤a;
0
if |x| ≥a,
(5.5)
up to normalization. (See Fig. 5.4.)
Like the minimal uncertainty wave packet, the test function is continuous, and has con-
tinuous derivatives of all orders. It has a well-deﬁned Fourier transform. However, since its
derivatives vanish for |x| ≥a, it does not have a Taylor expansion there; unlike the mini-
mal uncertainty wave packet, it is not analytic. (As a function of complex x, it has essential
singularities.) Non-analytic functions are worth considering. Indeed, we cannot describe the

world without them. Relativistic causality states that a cause at one spacetime point can have
no measurable effect at another spacetime point, until a time equal to their spatial separation
divided by the speed of light c has elapsed. If we change a quantum wave at one spacetime
point, the rest of the wave cannot change instantly, so the entire wave function cannot have a
Taylor expansion. Thus relativistic causality is incompatible with complete analyticity.
Now consider two wave packets, ψ1 and ψ2, on the x-axis. With these two wave packets
let us deﬁne (up to normalization) a class of wave functions Ψα,
Ψα = ψ1 + eiαψ2 ,
where α is a constant. The overall phase is unmeasurable, thus ψ1+eiαψ2 and e−iαψ1+ψ2 are
equivalent. But if two phase factors eiα and eiβ are different, then Ψα and Ψβ are physically
different. If ψ1 and ψ2 overlap and interfere (and they will as Ψα evolves) the resulting
interference pattern depends on the relative phase α. Nevertheless, as long as they do not
overlap, the relative phase α affects neither the probability density nor the current density. Of
course, if ψ1 and ψ2 are minimal uncertainty wave packets, they always overlap to some extent.
Strictly speaking, two wave packets ψ1 and ψ2 do not overlap only if they have no common
support. For example, let ψ1 be the test function of Eq. (5.5) centered at x = 0 and let ψ2 be
the test function centered at x = L with L > 2a. (See Fig. 5.5.) Then ψ1 and ψ2 are strictly
non-overlapping.
We now prove a fundamental theorem about interference: If Ψα(x, 0) = ψ1 + eiαψ2

Ψα(x, t) = U(t)Ψα(x, 0) = e−ip2t/2mℏΨα(x, 0) ;
then Ψα(x, t) solves the free Schr¨odinger equation and the integrand is

Modular Momentum
Interference of two wave packets ψ1 and ψ2 reveals their relative phase α, but the wave packets
must overlap to interfere, as Sect. 4.2 assumes. And from the theorem in the last section, we
learn that the expectation values of operators of the form xjpk depend on the relative phase
only if the wave packets overlap. It looks as if no physical observable reveals the relative phase,
as long as the wave packets ψ1 and ψ2 do not overlap. Yet consider the operator eipL/ℏ. In
general,
eipL/ℏf(x) = f(x + L)
(5.7)
for any function f(x) with a Fourier transform. If Ψα consists of two wave packets separated
by a distance L, then eipL/ℏbrings them together. For example, if Ψα is the normalized sum of
ψt(x) and eiαψt(x −L), then the expectation value ⟨Ψα|eipL/ℏ|Ψα⟩is simply eiα/2. While
eipL/ℏis not a self-adjoint operator, eipL/ℏ+ e−ipL/ℏis; its expectation value is cos α.
Clearly, cos α depends on α. But suppose we expand eipL/ℏ+ e−ipL/ℏ= 2 cos(pL/ℏ) in
powers of p: we have
cos(pL/ℏ) = 1 −(pL/ℏ)2

but each term in this series is independent of α, so the sum should be independent of α. Try to

we get a series which sums to f(x + L) if and only if f(x) is analytic, i.e. if the second
line in Eq. (5.8) is the Taylor series expansion of f(x + L). Equation (5.8) holds only for
analytic functions, but Eq. (5.7) holds for all functions having a Fourier transform. Not all
quantum wave functions are analytic, but all quantum wave functions have a Fourier transform
(momentum representation).
The operator eipL/ℏreveals the relative phase α, a nonlocal aspect of Ψα, because it
translates the wave function. By contrast, operators of the form xjpk reveal nothing about
α until the wave packets overlap and interfere. We see now that the usual statement of the
uncertainty principle, ∆x∆p ≥ℏ/2 with (∆x)2 = ⟨x2⟩−⟨x⟩2 and (∆p)2 = ⟨p2⟩−⟨p⟩2,
could tell us nothing about interference, because ⟨x⟩, ⟨p⟩, ∆x and ∆p are all independent of the
relative phase. The fact that ⟨cos(pL/ℏ)⟩and other observables do depend on the relative phase
suggests that we can ﬁnd uncertainty relations that apply directly to quantum interference. To
ﬁnd them, we start by asking what information eipL/ℏcontains. If we replace p by p −nh/L
in eipL/ℏ, the operator remains invariant, since ein2π = 1. So eipL/ℏdoes not depend on all of
p; it depends only on p mod nh/L. We call this quantity the modular momentum and denote it
pmod. Thus pmod is deﬁned relative to L and takes values in the interval [0, h/L). If we know
something about pmod, then some of these values are more probable than others; if we know
nothing about pmod, then all the values are equally probable and the expectation value
⟨eipmodL/ℏ⟩= ⟨eipL/ℏ⟩= 0
vanishes because the values of pmodL/ℏare distributed with equal probability in the interval
[0, 2π). The converse is not true; for example, ⟨eipL/ℏ⟩vanishes if pmod = 0 and pmod = h/2L
both have probability 1/2. But if ⟨einpL/ℏ⟩vanishes for every positive integer n, then all the
values of pmod are equally probable.2 We state this result as the complete uncertainty principle:
2We can think of pmodL/ℏas an angle, since it takes values in the interval [0, 2π). Then ⟨einpL/ℏ⟩is the n-th
Fourier component of the distribution of this angle. If ⟨eipL/ℏ⟩vanishes for all positive n, then it vanishes for all
negative n (since the distribution is real) and the distribution is ﬂat.

5.4
The xmod, pmod Representation
69
pmod is completely uncertain if and only if ⟨einpL/ℏ⟩vanishes for every positive integer n.
Note that ⟨einpL/ℏ⟩vanishes in any state Ψ(x) conﬁned to an interval of length L, for then
Ψ(x) and einpL/ℏΨ(x) have no common support.
This result directly explains the connection between uncertainty and the breakdown of
interference. Let ψ1 and ψ2 represent wave packets emerging from two slits separated by a
distance L, with relative phase α. In the state Ψα the expectation value of eipL/ℏdoes not
vanish; in either of the states ψ1 or ψ2 it does. Thus what is lost when we detect though which
slit a particle passes (and reduce the state Ψα to either ψ1 or ψ2) is all knowledge of the modular
momentum pmod.
5.4
The xmod, pmod Representation
Having deﬁned pmod, we may look for an analogous quantity for x. For a grating of slits
spaced a distance L apart, the modular momentum of an electron is pmod = p mod h/L
because the electron and grating can exchange transverse momentum only in multiples of h/L.
The electron passes this grating via the slits, but we do not know which slit. What we know is
the electron’s transverse position modulo L. So we deﬁne the modular position to be xmod = x
mod L. We have the identity
ei2πxmod/L = ei2πx/L
analogous to the identity eipmodL/ℏ= eipL/ℏ. We could, of course, deﬁne xmod = x mod
L′ for arbitrary L′, but L′ = L ﬁts the physical conditions. The fact that pmod and xmod
are mutually deﬁned makes them satisfy a particularly simple commutation relation. We can
calculate the commutator of eipmodL/ℏand ei2πxmod/L′ for arbitrary L′ by applying Eq. (5.7).
We have
eipL/ℏei2πx/L′f(x) = ei2π(x+L)/L′f(x + L) = ei2πx/L′+i2πL/L′eipL/ℏf(x) ,
for any function f(x) with a Fourier transform; therefore pmod and xmod commute,

(5.9)
if and only if L/L′ is an integer [2]. In general, two operators f(x) and g(p) commute only
if both are periodic and the product of their periods is a multiple of h. Figure 5.6 shows that
xmod is periodic in x with period L and pmod is periodic in p with period h/L; the product of
the periods is h. Unlike x and p, xmod and pmod commute.
Since xmod and pmod commute, no uncertainty principle keeps us from measuring them at
the same time. We can represent our knowledge of x and p by dividing phase space into cells of
area h as in Fig. 5.7. Figure 5.7 shows the case of xmod = L/4 and pmod = h/2L. They could
represent, for example, the modular position and momentum (along the x-axis) of the electrons
in the paradox of Sect. 5.1 (with solenoids shifting the phase by eΦB/ℏc = π). The electrons
must pass through the slits in the grating; we only know each electron’s transverse position
modulo L, since we do not know through which slit it passed. The lattice of solenoids shifts
the angles, and thus the transverse momenta, of the diffracted electrons; we only know their

transverse momenta modulo h/L, since we do not know through which angle each electron
diffracts.
The fact that xmod and pmod commute has great signiﬁcance. Quantum mechanics limits
our knowledge in a way that classical physics does not, but not in the way we might expect.
If f(x) represents our knowledge of a particle’s position x and g(p) our knowledge of its
momentum p, they are compatible only if [f(x), g(p)] = 0. Since x and p do not commute, we
might conclude that knowing a particle’s position is incompatible with knowing whether, say,
its momentum is conserved. However, xmod and pmod provide a representation in which we
can have exact information about both position and momentum. This representation is unique
and exists for any conjugate pair of physical variables, including energy and time, allowing
partial but exact information about both variables.
The paradox in Sect. 5.1 arises from the fact that the interaction among the electrons, the
grating and the solenoids conserves momentum, and momentum is an unbounded quantity.
Exchanges of momentum between the electrons and the solenoids, no matter how small, must
eventually amount to a measurable effect. But now that we have deﬁned modular momentum,
we see that the interaction between the electrons and the solenoids separately conserves pmod.
If the sum of the momenta pe of the electrons, pgr of the grating and psol of the lattice of
solenoids is conserved, we have
cos([pe + pgr + psol]L/ℏ) = constant .
(5.10)

5.5
Intimations of Nonlocality
71
Since pgr changes in multiples of h/L, the modular momentum of the grating does not change.
Equation (5.10) then deﬁnes a relation between the modular momenta of the electrons and
solenoids.3 The electrons and solenoids exchange modular momentum via nonlocal phases;
but from the theorem of Sect. 5.2 we infer that the expectation values ⟨p2
e⟩and ⟨p2
sol⟩do
not depend on nonlocal phases. Hence the changes in momentum do not accumulate to a
measurable effect. The changes in the modular momentum of the solenoids are like a random
walk on a circle.
After deﬁning xmod and pmod we deﬁne also Nx and Np according to
x = NxL + xmod ,
p = Np(h/L) + pmod .
Applying Eq. (5.9), we obtain the relations

which recall the relation


= ℏeiφ; that is, xmod and pmod are analogous to angles. In
the same way that Lz, φ form a conjugate pair, so do ℏNx and (L/ℏ)pmod, and also ℏNp and
(2π/L)xmod; their uncertainties are related approximately by
∆Nx∆pmod ≥h/L ,
∆Np∆xmod ≥L .
(5.12)
The usual uncertainty principle states that if we try to localize a particle in phase space, the
best we can do is localize it in a cell of area h. As Eq. (5.12) and Fig. 5.7 show, if we don’t ask
in which cell it is, we can know exactly where it is in a cell. When do we need xmod and pmod?
The observables x and p and their uncertainty relation are adequate for analyzing a single wave
packet. For a single wave packet we know Nx and Np very well, so xmod and pmod are almost
completely unknown. But to analyze interference and other phenomena involving more than
one wave packet, we need modular variables.
Note the contrast between Eq. (5.9) and its classical counterpart, the Poisson bracket. If
we require the Poisson bracket of two functions f(x) and g(p) to vanish, we have
0 = {f(x), g(p)} = df
dx
dg
dp .
(5.13)
Equation (5.13) implies that either f(x) or g(p) is a constant, so the only solutions are trivial.
So what happens to xmod and pmod in the classical limit? Taking ℏ→0 we ﬁnd that xmod and
pmod cannot both have any deﬁnite value; thus nonlocal interference effects must disappear in
the classical limit.

evolves a state |Ψ⟩forward in time:
|Ψ(t)⟩= U(t)|Ψ(0)⟩.
(5.15)
Schr¨odinger’s equation is the time derivative of Eq. (5.15). For simplicity, we have taken H to
be time independent in Eq. (5.14). In the Schr¨odinger formalism any operator Ωs, including H,
is unchanging unless it depends explicitly on time. In the Heisenberg formalism, by contrast,
states are unchanging and the operator Ωh corresponding to Ωs evolves in time according to
Ωh(t) = U −1(t)ΩsU(t) .
(5.16)
Thus expectation values and eigenvalues come out the same in the two formulations. The time
derivative of Eq. (5.16) gives us the equation of motion for Ωh:
dΩh
dt
= i
ℏ[H, Ωh] + U −1(t)∂Ωs
∂t U(t) .
(5.17)
Consider the Heisenberg equation of motion for the operator eipL/ℏwhen the Hamiltonian
is H = p2/2m + V (x). Equation (5.17) yields
d
dteipL/ℏ= i
ℏ[V (x) −V (x + L)]eipL/ℏ,
(5.18)
since eipL/ℏgenerates displacements. This difference equation involves the potential evaluated
at x and at x + L. How does it compare with the classical equation of motion? The limit of
eipL/ℏas ℏ→0 does not exist if L is constant; so let us rewrite eipL/ℏas ei2πp/p0 with
p0 = h/L, and keep p0 constant. Then both L and ℏgo to 0 in the classical limit. The classical
equation of motion for ei2πp/p0 is

and contains a derivative rather than a difference.
Still, the two equations of motion are
consistent: [V (x) −V (x + L)]/ℏin Eq. (5.18) equals (2π/p0L)[V (x) −V (x + L)] and
approaches −(2π/p0)dV/dx as L →0.
Yet there is a fundamental difference between the classical and quantum equations of
motion. The classical equation of motion, Eq. (5.19), is local; ei2πp/p0 changes only if dV/dx
is nonzero, i.e. if a force acts directly at x. The quantum equation of motion, Eq. (5.18),
is nonlocal: ei2πp/p0 can change even if dV/dx is zero at the particle’s position, but V (x +
L) −V (x) ̸= 0. Figure 5.8 shows a wave packet in a staircase potential V (x) = V0Nx. The
wave packet, on the step in the interval (L, 2L), is nonzero only where V (x) is constant and
there is no force. We don’t expect the momentum of the particle to change. But the modular
momentum does change: V (x + L) −V (x) = V0 for all x, and so the modular momentum
behaves as pmod(t) = [pmod(0) −V0t/ℏ] mod h/L, whatever the particle’s state.
Because it obeys a nonlocal equation of motion, modular momentum is the key to describing
interferenceinHeisenberg’sformulation. Let’sanalyze, ﬁrstofall, theinteractionofanelectron
and a grating. The electron passes the grating, so we have precise information about xmod (in

the transverse direction); xmod and pmod commute, so we have precise information about pmod.
But xmod and Np do not commute (see Eqs. (5.11–12)) so we have no information about Np.
The interaction of the electron with the grating conserves pmod (see Prob. 5.5) so these facts
determine the interference pattern completely: pmod ﬁxes the position of the fringes relative
to the grating; Np is completely uncertain and therefore the fringes are equally dense. Now
consider the effect of a lattice of solenoids. The solenoids affect the modular momentum in the
same way as the stair potential V (x) of Fig. 5.8. The nonlocal interaction of the electrons with
the solenoids changes pmod of the diffracting electrons; hence the diffraction pattern shifts.
Thus we have a new description of interference. Instead of a quantum wave that passes
through all the slits of a grating, we have a quantum particle that obeys a nonlocal equation
of motion. This equation of motion is exact if the grating is inﬁnite and the incoming beam
is an eigenstate of momentum. And even if V (x + L) −V (x) depends on x, e.g. for the
case of only two slits, the expectation value of eip0L/ℏobeys a nonlocal equation of motion.
Modular variables provide intuition for the behavior of quantum particles, and they lead us to
ask new questions. Here is one: Consider a particle approaching a screen with a single open
slit. As it reaches the slit, we open a second slit. By opening the second slit, we change the
particle’s modular momentum. Don’t we act at a distance by changing the particle’s modular
momentum? The answer is that if we can be sure that the particle passes through the ﬁrst
slit, then its initial modular momentum is completely uncertain and there is no way to detect
action at a distance. This is one example of the remarkable way in which quantum mechanics
reconciles causality and nonlocality. We will see others.

6 Nonlocality and Causality
Newton suspected the apparent nonlocality of gravity. “That gravity should be innate, inherent
and essential to matter so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum
without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action or force may be
conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in
philosophical matters any competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it” [1]. More than
two centuries years later, Einstein conﬁrmed Newton’s suspicions: gravitational interactions
are local. Einstein’s theory of gravity is free of the “absurdity” of action at a distance.
But quantum mechanics is nonlocal, in at least two ways. There are nonlocal quantum
correlations. And there are nonlocal quantum equations of motion: modular momentum,
for example, obeys a nonlocal equation of motion. (See Sects. 3.4 and 5.5.) Still, nonlocal
quantum correlations do not manifest action at a distance; they manifest “passion at a distance”
(in Shimony’s apt phrase [2]): there is no cause and no effect in quantum correlations. (See
Prob. 3.11.) What about nonlocal equations of motion? Quantum equations of motion may
be nonlocal, but quantum uncertainty hides action at a distance. In the example of Sect. 5.5,
a particle is about to pass through a screen with a single slit. By opening a second slit some
distance away, we change how the modular momentum of the particle evolves. Now modular
momentum is an observable; we measure it to observe quantum interference. But in this
example, the initial modular momentum of the particle is completely uncertain, so we never
see action at a distance. Quantum nonlocality has a logic of its own. Modular variables expose
this logic, leading us into paradox but not into contradiction.
6.1
Causality and a Piston
Figure 6.1 shows a long cylinder with a particle in it. The cylinder has a seal at one end, and
a piston, initially at rest, at the other end. There is no friction between the piston and the
cylinder, but the piston is much heavier than the particle and hardly moves if the particle hits
it. Attached to the outer end of the piston is a box with two open sides. Suppose that a little
ball strikes the box on the piston while the particle inside the cylinder is as far as possible (a
distance L) from the piston. The ball bounces through the box on the piston in two completely
elastic collisions that move the piston inward a distance |δL|. (See Fig. 6.2.) Does the particle
in the cylinder affect the trajectory of the ball?
Let us ﬁrst answer this question within classical mechanics. The ball bounces once off the
piston, and the piston moves inward. If the ball bounces off the piston a second time before
the particle reaches the piston, it regains all its energy and momentum and leaves the piston

at rest. But if the particle reaches the piston between the two bounces, it carries energy and
momentum away from the piston; and when the ball bounces off the piston a second time, it
does not regain all the energy and momentum it lost to the piston, and leaves with reduced
energy and momentum.
Do we get the same answer in quantum mechanics? Let us take a close look. Again we
compare time scales. Suppose the particle is fast and bounces from one end of the cylinder to
the other many times between the two collisions of the ball. Its energy increases between the
collisions.1 This increase in energy must come out of the energy of the ball, so the ball loses
energy to the piston. But what if the particle is too slow to reach the piston before the second
collision? We may assume that the energy of the ball does not change.
Yet the following argument [3] shows that our assumption is incorrect. Let us prepare the
particle in an initial state |ψ(0)⟩, at time t = 0; the initial state is a wave packet with very large
uncertainty ∆x in position and very small uncertainty ∆p in momentum. Suppose ∆x is very
large compared with |δL| (but small compared with L) and |ψ(0)⟩is localized near the sealed
end of the cylinder, as far as possible from the piston. In the absence of the ball, the particle
traverses the cylinder back and forth in a time T = 2L/|⟨v⟩| where ⟨v⟩is the expectation value
of the velocity of the particle. In time T, the wave packet returns to its initial position and
momentum, keeping its shape. (See Prob. 6.1.) It spreads out, as Eq. (5.4) shows, but spreads
out very little if v is large. We can neglect the spreading if

The particle is in a

the energies En increase. If the decrease in L is adiabatic, the coefﬁcients of the states |n⟩remain the same. Hence
the expectation value of the energy increases.

with H the Hamiltonian of the particle. On the one hand, Eq. (6.2) is the expectation value of
e−iHT/ℏat time t = 0. (Although e−iHT/ℏis not an observable, its real and imaginary parts
are observables.) On the other hand, Eq. (6.2) contains the state of the particle at time t = T,
|ψ(T)⟩= e−iHT/ℏ|ψ(0)⟩,
so here the present (t = 0) contains the future (t = T).
Let us evaluate Eq. (6.2) in two cases. In the ﬁrst case, the ball does not strike the piston
any time before t = T. In the approximation that the wave packet does not spread, we can
immediately compute Eq. (6.2): e−iHT/ℏevolves the state |ψ(0)⟩forward a time T, and |ψ(0)⟩
and |ψ(T)⟩are the same up to an overall phase. By adjusting L, we can set this phase to 1.
(See Prob. 6.3.) Thus
|ψ(T)⟩= |ψ(0)⟩
(6.3)
and the expectation value is 1. In the second case, the ball strikes the piston at time t = 0,
moving it inwards, and again at some time t ≪T/2. These two bounces hardly affect |ψ(0)⟩,
which vanishes at the piston. However, they change the potential term in the Hamiltonian
H. The operator e−iHT/ℏstill evolves the state |ψ(0)⟩forward a time T, but now |ψ(T)⟩
is displaced a distance 2|δL| from |ψ(0)⟩, because the cylinder has become shorter inside.
We can express this displacement as the action of the translation operator ei2p|δL|/ℏ; then we
obtain, instead of Eq. (6.3),
|ψ(T)⟩= ei2p|δL|/ℏ|ψ(0)⟩.
For ∆x ≫|δL| the overlap |⟨ψ(T)|ψ(0)⟩| remains close to 1; but the phase of |ψ(T)⟩has
changed. The change in phase is approximately ei2⟨p⟩|δL|/ℏ, where ⟨p⟩is the expectation value
⟨ψ(0)|p|ψ(0)⟩. (See Prob. 6.4.) So the ball changes the expectation value of e−iHT/ℏalready
at time t = 0. From the change in this expectation value we infer a small change in the energy
of the particle, of roughly −2⟨p⟩|δL|/T. It does not matter that we did not compute the change
exactly. What matters is that the ball has changed the energy of the particle in the cylinder,
even while the particle is far from the piston. By conservation of energy, the energy of the ball
has changed, too. Thus a change in the energy of the ball immediately shows that there is a
particle in the cylinder, even if the particle is nowhere near the piston!
Now that is action at a distance. Suppose that Alice stands at the sealed end of the cylinder
and Bob stands near the piston. They agree that, at time t = 0, Alice may or may not insert a
particle into the cylinder, in the state |ψ(0)⟩. Then Alice sends one bit of information to Bob.
By inserting a particle into the cylinder, Alice says Yes to Bob; by leaving the cylinder empty,
she says No. Bob measures the energy of the ball just before and just after its two collisions
with the piston. A change in the energy means Yes; no change means No. But since the time
between the collisions is less than T/2, Alice’s message reaches Bob before the particle does!
6.2
Quantum Effects Without Classical Analogues
This section presents three quantum effects without classical analogues. Each is likely to
surprise us. We see that quantum mechanics implies the effect, and we try to understand the

80

Nonlocality and Causality
effect intuitively; yet each new effect surprises us anew. Indeed, we have not understood; once
we really understand the effects, we see that they are almost the same.
The ﬁrst effect concerns a particle in a sealed cylinder with a piston (again). Initially, the
inner length of the cylinder is L and the particle is in an eigenstate of energy with wavelength
λ = 2L/N, with N large. If we suddenly pull the piston out a distance δL, the wave function
of the particle has no time to adjust. What happens to the kinetic energy E of the particle?
Speciﬁcally, what happens if δL = λ/2, and what happens if δL is slightly less than λ/2?
If δL = λ/2, the energy is overwhelmingly likely to remain the same. The energy depends
on the wavelength, and the wavelength will most likely remain the same – the eigenstate of the
new Hamiltonian will resemble the initial eigenstate, but with one additional node. The inner
product between these states is L1/2(L + λ/2)−1/2, so the probability that the energy stays
the same is
L
L + λ/2 =
N
N + 1 ,
which is nearly 1. Now suppose δL = (λ/2)(1−ϵ), where ϵ is small and positive. Once again,
the most probable new eigenstate is the one with just one more node; however, the wavelength
λ′ in the new eigenstate is slightly shorter than λ. Since
(N + 1)(λ′/2) = N(λ/2) + (λ/2)(1 −ϵ) ,
we have
λ′ = λ
	
1 −
ϵ
N + 1

.
The kinetic energy E′ of the new eigenstate is therefore
E′ ≈E + π2ℏ2ϵN
mL2
,
and the energy of the particle in the cylinder has increased! There are other ﬁnal states with
kinetic energy less than E; indeed, the expectation value of the energy does not change if we
suddenly pull out the piston. But the probability that the particle has ﬁnal energy E′ > E is
substantial. (See Prob. 6.6.) This effect has no classical analogue; classically, the energy of
the particle can only decrease if we pull out the piston. (Since E′ −E is proportional to ℏ2,
the increase in energy vanishes in the classical limit.)
The second effect involves noninteracting one-dimensional particles in a momentum eigen-
state. The particles are free except for a very brief time T when they are subject to the potential
V (x) shown in Fig. 6.3. The corresponding force ﬁeld is periodic in the position x: it equals
a constant F for nL ≤x ≤nL + a, with n any integer, and vanishes elsewhere. According
to classical mechanics, the force affects only the fraction a/L of particles that happen to be in
the regions where it is nonzero; each of these particles gets an impulse FT in the direction of
increasing x. If a/L is small and there are not many particles, the force may not affect any of
them.

According to quantum mechanics, something quite different happens. Let us compute the
effect of the potential on an initial state Ψin(x) of zero momentum, Ψin(x) = 1/
√
2π. The
ﬁnal state Ψfin(x) after a time T is
Ψfin(x) = e−iHT/ℏΨin(x) ,
where H is the sum of the kinetic term p2/2m and the potential term V (x). These terms do
not commute. However, if we ﬁx the product α = aFT and take the limit T →0, we can
neglect the kinetic term. (See Prob. 6.8.) The ﬁnal state Ψfin(x) is
Ψfin(x) = e−iV (x)T/ℏΨin(x) =
1
√
2π e−iV (x)T/ℏ,
where V (x)T does not depend on T since α = aFT does not. To see what Ψfin(x) represents,
we compute its Fourier transform ˜Ψfin(p). For simplicity, we take a/Lto be small and compute
the Fourier transform in the limit a/L →0. (See also Prob. 6.9.) We obtain
˜Ψfin(p) =

For α = 0, ˜Ψfin(p) reduces to δ(p/ℏ), the initial state. But for α nonzero, there is a shift
in the momentum. The possible values of p are p = α/L −nh/L, where n is any integer.
These values are not equally probable. The probability of p in the ﬁnal state is proportional to
sin2(pL/2ℏ)/p2. Now let us take α = (2π −ϵ)ℏ, where ϵ is small and positive. Fig. 6.4 shows
the probability distribution for p in the ﬁnal state. The most likely value of p is p = −ϵℏ/L.

Thus, a force to the right at points x = nL most likely moves quantum particles to the left!
This is a purely quantum effect, vanishing in the limit ℏ→0.
The third effect involves a spin-1/2 particle of magnetic moment µ in a magnetic ﬁeld. The
Hamiltonian for the particle is
H = µℏ
2 [σzBz + σzB′
z(t) + σxBx(t)] ,
where Bz (pointing in the z-direction) is constant while B′
z(t) (also pointing in the z-direction)
and Bx(t) (pointing in the x-direction) are periodic in time. If B′
z(t) and Bx(t) are zero, the
particle simply precesses in the constant magnetic ﬁeld with angular frequency ω = µBz, and
Sz = ℏσz/2 is a constant of the motion. Suppose B′
z(t) = 0 but Bx(t) pulses with period T.
(See Fig. 6.5(a).) Will the spin ﬂip? It will ﬂip if T is any multiple of the precession time. The
particle makes a full precession in a time 2π/ω = 2π/µBz. If T is a multiple of this time, i.e.
if
T = 2nπ/µBz
(6.7)
for integer n, then the effect of Bx(t) is cumulative and the spin ﬂips. Otherwise, the effect
of Bx(t) averages to zero. Suppose that both B′
z(t) and Bx(t) pulse with period T, but never
at the same time, as in Fig. 6.5(b). Even if T does not satisfy Eq. (6.7), we can still ﬂip the
spin by choosing B′
z(t) appropriately. This effect has a simple classical explanation. The ﬁeld
B′
z(t) adjusts the particle’s precession so that the particle makes one or more full precessions

between every Bx(t) pulse, even if T does not satisfy Eq. (6.7); then the effect of Bx(t) is still
cumulative. The same explanation applies to the quantum particle. So where is the quantum
effect without a classical analogue?
The answer is that the effect has a classical analogue if we look at precession, but not
if we look at energy. The change of energy in a ﬂip between | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩(eigenstates of
σz) is ±µℏBz. What accounts for this energy change? The B′
z(t) ﬁeld brieﬂy changes the
particle’s energy, but the change averages to zero. The proof is that [σzBz +σxBx(t), σzB′
z(t)]
vanishes (since Bx(t)B′
z(t) vanishes) so the average values of σzBz + σxBx(t) and σzB′
z(t)
are constant in time. Thus, the particle can exchange energy only with the Bx(t) ﬁeld.
But if B′
z(t) vanishes, the particle and the Bx(t) ﬁeld (i.e. the terms µℏσzBz/2 and
µℏσxBx(t)/2 in H) can exchange energy only in multiples of h/T. This fact follows from a
perturbative calculation. Suppose we subject the particle to a perturbation g0V sin ωt lasting
a time T/g0, where g0 is a constant, the operator V is time independent, and ω ≈µBz. The
probability of a spin ﬂip is approximately
⟨↑|V | ↓⟩g0
sin(µBzT/g0 −ωT/g0)

.
(6.8)
(See Prob. 6.11.) Now we consider the limit g0 →0; we ﬁnd that the spin ﬂips only if
µBz = ω. The limit g0 →0 is pertinent because the perturbation can be arbitrarily long
and weak; as long as Bx(t) has a cumulative effect on the spin, the spin will eventually ﬂip.
The Fourier components of Bx(t) have angular frequencies that are multiples of 2π/T, so by
applying Eq. (6.8) (or Eq. (2.3)) we ﬁnd that Bx(t) supplies energy in quanta hν = h/T, i.e.
the spin ﬂips only if µℏBz = nh/T. So we are back to Eq. (6.7).
To summarize:
i) If the B′
z(t) ﬁeld is zero, the particle and the Bx(t) ﬁeld exchange energy only in quanta
h/T. The spin does not ﬂip unless the spin energy gap is a multiple of h/T.
ii) If the B′
z(t) ﬁeld is nonzero, it exchanges no energy with the particle and the Bx(t)
ﬁeld. But the spin ﬂips even if the spin energy gap is not a multiple of h/T.
Apparently, the B′
z(t) ﬁeld modiﬁes the exchange of energy between the particle and the
Bx(t) ﬁeld, while making no net contribution to their energy! This effect is nonlocal in time
since B′
z(t) vanishes whenever the particle and the Bx(t) ﬁeld interact.

Nonlocality and Causality
6.3
Modular Energy
The last two sections describe quantum effects without classical analogues. The Aharonov–
Bohm effect (Sect. 4.4) is another such effect. What do all these effects have in common? They
are all nonlocal. Even the ﬁrst effect in Sect. 6.2 (where pulling back a piston in a cylinder
increases the energy of a particle inside) is nonlocal in that local interactions (collisions between
the particle and the pulled piston) can only decrease the energy of the particle. What else do
the effects have in common?
Let’s return to the Aharonov–Bohm effect and consider an electron in a long, narrow box.
Figure 6.6(a) shows the initial state of the electron. The wave function is symmetric around
the vertical axis in Fig. 6.6(a) and vanishes in a central region. A long, thin solenoid carrying
a ﬂux hc/2e – half a ﬂux quantum – crosses the box through the central region in a short
time T. It leaves the box before the electron wave function can spread to the central region,
hence the electron never touches the solenoid. However, the solenoid induces a relative phase
of −1 between the two halves of the wave function on either side of the central region. (The
Aharonov–Bohm phase depends only on the relative motion of the solenoid and the electron.)
Once the solenoid passes, the state of the electron is antisymmetric in the vertical axis of
Fig. 6.6(b). The symmetric and antisymmetric states have different energies. Thus the passage
of the solenoid has changed the distribution of energy of the electron. Yet the energy distribution
of the solenoid does not change, because the solenoid never encounters the electron.
We can analyze this nonlocal effect as follows. Let ρe and ρs denote the probability distri-
butions for the energies of the electron and the solenoid, respectively, and ρes the probability
distribution for their combined energy; ρes is a convolution of ρe and ρs:
ρes(E) =

ρe(E −E′)ρs(E′)dE′ .
(6.9)
If total energy is conserved, ρes(E) does not change with time. Also, ρs(E′) does not change.
But ρe(E −E′) changes. From Eq. (6.9) we do not see just how ρe(E −E′) can change while
ρes(E) and ρs(E′) do not, but from the Fourier transform of Eq. (6.9) we do. By deﬁnition,


eiEt/ℏρs(E)dE
= (2π)−1/2⟨ψs|eiHst/ℏ|ψs⟩,
(6.10)
where ψs is the initial wave function of the solenoid and Hs is its Hamiltonian. The Fourier
transform of Eq. (6.9) is
˜ρes(t) = ˜ρe(t)˜ρs(t) .
Now ρe can change without ρs and ρes changing only if ˜ρe changes without ˜ρs and ˜ρes
changing. That is, ˜ρs(t) and ˜ρes(t) must vanish over some interval in t. The term ⟨ψs|eiHst/ℏ
in the second line of Eq. (6.10) represents the wave function of the solenoid after a time t. If
˜ρs(t) = 0, then after a time t the solenoid has evolved to an orthogonal state. The solenoid
does indeed evolve to an orthogonal state: it crosses the box in a time T. Hence if t ≥T, then
˜ρs(t) vanishes.
We can interpret ⟨ψs|eiHst/ℏ|ψs⟩in Eq. (6.10) as the expectation value of eiHst/ℏ=
ei(Hs)modt/ℏ, where we deﬁne the modular energy (Hs)mod or (Es)mod of the solenoid to
be its energy modulo h/t, in analogy with the deﬁnitions of pmod and xmod (Sects. 5.3–4).
Equation (6.10) shows that the modular energy of the solenoid is completely uncertain if t ≥T.
What does it mean for the modular energy to be completely uncertain? Suppose the modular
energy of the electron changes. Then so does the modular energy of the solenoid: the sum of
energies Ee +Es does not change, hence the modular energies of the solenoid and the electron
satisfy
cos(Ee + Es)t/ℏ= constant .
(6.11)
Equation (6.11) deﬁnes an ellipse. (See Fig. 6.7 and Prob. 5.10.) By measuring the modular
energy of the solenoid immediately before and after it crosses the box, we could determine
any change in the modular energy of the electron. But since the solenoid never encounters the
electron, any measurable change in (Es)mod would be action at a distance. Can we observe
action at a distance? We cannot, because the modular energy of the solenoid is completely
uncertain.

Nonlocality and Causality
Here is the logic of quantum nonlocality. The electron and the solenoid interact nonlocally,
exchanging modular energy. The nonlocal interaction is well deﬁned only after the solenoid
crosses the box; but after the solenoid has crossed the box, its modular energy is completely
uncertain. Indeed Es mod h/T is completely uncertain at all times, since the solenoid moves
to an orthogonal state in a time T. Hence the nonlocal exchange of modular energy has no
observable effect on the solenoid.
Modular energy and momentum are the key to the effects in Sects. 6.1–2. In Sect. 6.1, the
presence of a particle in the cylinder shows up as a change in the energy of the ball. Speciﬁcally,
Eq. (6.2) implies that it is the modular energy – the energy modulo h/T – of the the ball that
changes, if and only if Alice puts a particle in the cylinder. Bob must measure the change in
the modular energy of the ball in order to detect the presence of the particle. He must measure
the modular energy of the ball before and after its two collisions with the piston, and he must
do so within a time less than T to demonstrate action at a distance. It follows that in a time
less than T the ball must have bounced twice and evolved to an orthogonal state, i.e. that
⟨Ψ(0)|e−iHballT/ℏ|Ψ(0)⟩= 0 ,
where |Ψ(0)⟩is the state of the ball at the ﬁrst bounce and Hball is the Hamiltonian of the ball.
Thus Eball mod h/T is completely uncertain2 and Bob cannot detect the particle that Alice
may or may not have put in the cylinder. Hence Alice cannot send a message to Bob by action
at a distance. In Sect. 6.2, the ﬁrst effect involves an exchange of modular energy Emod ≈E
mod ℏ2π2N/mL2; increases in energy are due to exchange of modular energy, while decreases
in energy are due to local interactions between the particle and the piston. In the second effect,
the unexpected motion of particles is due to exchanges of modular momentum, and in the third
effect the particle acquires modular energy from B′
z(t). (See Probs. 6.7 and 6.12.)
6.4
Reconciling the Irreconcilable
Quantum theory is implicitly nonlocal. Nonlocality is a wonder, but we may also wonder
why quantum nonlocality is implicit rather than explicit. Why do we have to work so hard to
demonstrate quantum nonlocality? Why isn’t quantum mechanics more nonlocal than it is? For
example, why can’t we exploit quantum nonlocality to send messages? Chapters 3–6 contain
many examples of quantum nonlocality. But in each example, we encounter a constraint. What
constraints does quantum nonlocality obey?
Let us try to guess a constraint: quantum nonlocality does not allow action at a distance.
Nonlocal correlations, we know, obey this constraint. (See Prob. 3.11). As for modular
variables, they behave nonlocally – by opening one slit, we change the modular momentum of
a particle passing through another slit – but in the example of Sect. 5.5, quantum uncertainty
prevents us from measuring the change, so we cannot exploit the change in modular momentum
to act at a distance. The examples of this chapter expose the same logic: quantum uncertainty
hides changes in modular variables that would otherwise manifest action at a distance. This
logic hints at a fundamental constraint.
2According to the complete uncertainty principle; see Sect. 5.3.

6.4
Reconciling the Irreconcilable
87
Nevertheless, the constraint we guessed is not right.
To see what is wrong, consider
the scalar Aharonov–Bohm effect. (See Sect. 4.4.) Electrons interfere along two paths on
either side of a capacitor. By charging the capacitor brieﬂy as the electrons pass, we change
their interference pattern. We can interpret this effect as the local effect of a scalar potential
V (x, t). However, the potential V (x, t) is not measurable; we can only measure the gradient
of V (x, t) (which vanishes along the two paths). To make the correspondence between theory
and measurement as close as possible, we choose the interpretation of Sect. 4.5: the change in
the electrons’ interference pattern is a nonlocal effect of the electric ﬁeld in the capacitor. This
nonlocal effect is action at a distance! The electric ﬁeld, acting at a distance on the electrons,
yields a measurable effect (the change in the electrons’ interference pattern). So quantum
nonlocality does permit action at a distance.
There is a constraint similar to the one we guessed. It is called (relativistic) causality. The
principle of causality states that there is no way to send a message faster than light. We do
not expect nonrelativistic quantum mechanics to obey this principle, because in nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics there is no maximum speed. However, nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
obeys the principle of causality more than we might expect. Nonlocal quantum correlations
obey causality, because they are useless for sending messages. The Aharonov–Bohm effect,
too, obeys causality: even if an electric or magnetic ﬁeld acts at a distance on electrons as they
pass, the only measurable effect – the change in the electrons’ interference pattern – lies within
the future light cone of the ﬁeld. (See Prob. 6.14.) In each example we ﬁnd that quantum
nonlocality obeys causality.
As Sect. 6.3 shows, the paradox of Sect. 6.1 respects causality because the modular energy
of the ball that moves the piston, Eball mod h/T, is completely uncertain. But Eball mod h/T
may not be completely uncertain, and then the paradox respects causality in a different way.
Let the ball move along its trajectory in a superposition of two identical wave packets, with
a time lag T between the wave packets. Then ⟨Ψ(0)|e−iHballT/ℏ|Ψ(0)⟩does not vanish and
Eball mod h/T is measurable. But then the uncertainty about when the ball struck the piston
is greater than T and the particle inside the cylinder could have reached the piston before the
ball.
It is remarkable that quantum theory reconciles nonlocality and causality. They seem
incompatible. Is quantum theory the only theory that reconciles causality and nonlocality? A
positive answer to this question would transform our understanding of quantum theory, for
then we could deduce quantum theory from causality and nonlocality. Quantum theory would
follow from two axioms:
i) All physical interactions respect causality.
ii) Some physical interactions are nonlocal.
Quantum theory would then be as logically simple as the special theory of relativity, which
follows from two axioms:
i′) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
ii′) The speed of light in vacuum is c.
Each of the axioms i′) and ii′) has a clear physical meaning. Axiom i′) states a fundamental
invariance; axiom ii′) deﬁnes a physical constant. These axioms are the starting point of the
special theory of relativity. If we chose another starting point, such as the dependence of
length and time on motion, the theory would look quite bizarre and meaningless. Why should
objects contract in the direction of their motion? Only after discovering the axioms i′) and ii′)

88

Nonlocality and Causality
would we understand the theory. Perhaps the problem of understanding quantum mechanics is
analogous. Quantum mechanics looks bizarre, because our axioms – statements about Hilbert
space and Hermitian operators – lack clear physical meaning. But axioms i) and ii) have clear
physical meaning.
Do axioms i) and ii) imply quantum theory? We return to this question in the last chapter
of the book. Here, we pose the question and suggest how quantum mechanics might plausibly
follow from these axioms. From i) and ii) we can deduce uncertainty: physical variables
that interact nonlocally cannot all have deﬁnite values at all times. Otherwise there would
be observable violations of causality. For example, any quantity that is exchanged nonlocally
must be unmeasurable. Causality requires modular momentum and modular energy to be
completely uncertain at times. Alice, by inserting a particle into the cylinder of Sect. 6.1,
changes the modular energy of the piston nonlocally – action at a distance. But the modular
energy of the piston is completely uncertain. We have action at a distance with no observable
results.
Yet action at a distance can have observable results. The “interaction-free” measurement of
Elitzur and Vaidman [4] is an example. To dramatize the interaction-free measurement, let us
imagine a “bomb” or “mine” so sensitive that any interaction makes it explode. Is there any way
we could detect such a bomb without exploding it? To detect a bomb in a region S, we build a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one of its arms crossing the region S. Figure 6.8(a) shows
the interferometer with no bomb in the region S. A half-silvered mirror splits the incident
photon beam into two equal parts. The parts recombine at another half-silvered mirror. By
adjusting the length of each arm (and taking into account the π/2 phase difference between
reﬂection and transmission), we can make the parts of the beam interfere constructively in one
direction and destructively in the other. Then all the photons leave the interferometer in the
same direction. If, however, a detector records which path the photon actually takes through
the interferometer, interference disappears (according to the complementarity principle) and
the photon may leave the interferometer in either direction. If there is a bomb in the region
S and it does not explode, it records the fact that the photon did not pass through S. The
photon went through the other arm of the interferometer. Then interference disappears and the
photon may come out either way. (See Fig. 6.8(b).) So if we see a single photon leave the
interferometer in the direction of destructive interference, we have detected the bomb without
exploding it.

This bafﬂing quantum effect nicely illustrates how modular variables work. The two possi-
ble ﬁnal states of the photon – the possible directions in which it may leave the interferometer
– correspond to different values of a modular variable. Which modular variable? Consider a
plane passing through the two half-silvered mirrors; let an operator P reﬂect the photon wave
function through this plane. (See Prob. 6.15.) The expectation value of P is cos α, where
α is the relative phase between the two parts of the photon wave function in the two arms of
the interferometer. The operator corresponding to α is a modular variable: it is nonlocal and
has the topology of an angle. The possible ﬁnal states of the photon correspond to different
distributions of α. When both arms of the interferometer are clear, the value of α is deﬁned and
the photon leaves the interferometer in the direction of Fig. 6.8(a). When one arm is obstructed,
α is completely uncertain and the photon leaves the interferometer in either direction. The
“bomb” acts at a distance on the photon by changing the expectation value of P.

7 Quantum Measurements
In physics, we expect a theory to correspond with experiments in two ways. One correspon-
dence is obvious: the theory should correctly predict the results of experiments. But there is
another, more subtle correspondence. The theory should predict not less and not more than the
results of possible experiments. That is, the theory should predict anything that experiments
can ever test, but it should not predict anything that experiments can never test. Does a theory
describe too little? Too much? These simple questions are among the most powerful we can
ask in criticizing a theory. They have led to great progress in physics. For example, Newton, in
his mechanics, made assertions about “absolute space” and “absolute time”. Mach questioned
these and other assertions of Newton’s mechanics. How do we deﬁne motion if there is nothing
else in the universe? We must deﬁne it relative to some reference frame such as the stars in
the sky, or whatever else we take to be motionless. In empty space we could never deﬁne
motion, so absolute space and time have no meaning. Mach’s critique helped Einstein arrive
at the special and general theories of relativity. Newton’s mechanics describes too much. A
theory that describes too little is thermodynamics; it accounts only for the bulk properties of
gases. (To account for the microscopic properties of molecules in gases, we need statistical
mechanics.) The special theory of relativity comes the closest to the ideal correspondence
between theory and experiment.
Thus, we can deepen our understanding of quantum mechanics by asking how well the
physical statements of the theory apply to experiments. The discussions of Bohr and Einstein
on quantum theory, from 1927 onwards, were devoted to this question. Einstein kept trying to
show that experiments can measure more than quantum mechanics allows, i.e. that quantum
mechanics describes too little. The fact that he did not succeed does not prove that he was
wrong. For example, the two thought experiments of Chap. 4 present a new challenge to
quantum mechanics, unknown to Einstein. We also encounter (in Chap. 11) the claim that
quantum mechanics describes too much, that there is no experiment that can distinguish among
certain quantum states. (Too much is better than too little.)
We begin this chapter with a paradox concerning a measurement of the velocity of a
quantum particle. This paradox apparently implies that the Heisenberg uncertainty relations
do not completely account for what we can and cannot measure in quantum mechanics. We
resolve this paradox by treating the device for measuring velocity as a quantum system. But
can we treat a measuring device as a quantum system? Bohr treated measurements via an ad
hoc division of the world into quantum and classical parts, with measuring devices residing in
the classical part. This description served him in his discussions with Einstein, allowing him to
resolve the clock-in-the-box paradox and others. (See Sect. 2.4.) However, the division of the
world into classical and quantum parts is not well deﬁned. Bohr never prescribed how to divide

the world into classical and quantum parts; the division arises in practice, not in principle.1 If
so, why not let the measuring device reside in the quantum part of the world? Such a treatment
does not resolve the question of where in the world is the dividing line (a question Chap. 9
addresses) but it has an outstanding advantage: if we treat the measuring device as a quantum
system, we automatically endow it with all the limitations and possibilities of a quantum system.
We need not, as Bohr and Einstein did, face each new question of measurement by asking what
limitations quantum mechanics imposes on a classical measuring device. Moreover, a quantum
measuring device may respond in ways we never anticipated. Treating the measuring device
as a quantum system allows us to consider (in Chaps. 14–17) quantum measurements that are
unlike any classical measurements.
7.1
The Velocity Paradox
Quantum systems present much more difﬁcult and interesting problems of measurement than
classical systems. We can make any measurement on a classical system and not disturb it, in
principle. But as Chap. 2 relates, some measurements on a quantum system must disturb it.
This fact led Heisenberg to the uncertainty relations. (See Sect. 2.3.)
What does measuring a quantum system disturb? According to the uncertainty relations,
the measured observable need not change. What changes is an observable conjugate to the
measured observable. When we measure the momentum of a particle, we assume that its
position, but not its momentum, changes. Since the momentum of a free, massive particle is
the product of its velocity and its mass, we expect that we can measure its velocity, too, without
changing it. We can measure its momentum as quickly as we like (in nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics2) so we expect that we can measure its velocity as quickly as we like, too.
However, let us consider an experiment on a free particle moving in one dimension. At
time t = 0 we know the position x(0) of the particle to an accuracy ∆x(0), from a prior
measurement. We also know its velocity v(0) to an accuracy ∆v(0) = ℏ/2m∆x(0), consistent
with the uncertainty relations. At t = 0 we begin a more accurate measurement of the particle’s
velocity. This measurement lasts a time T. At time T we know the particle’s velocity v(T)
with an accuracy ∆v(T) ≪∆v(0). (Fig. 7.1 is a graph of v(t) and ∆v(t) versus time.) We
assume that measuring the velocity does not change it, and that T can be as short as we like.
The position and velocity of the particle are related by the Heisenberg equation of motion,
Eq. (5.17):
v(t) = dx(t)
dt
= i
ℏ[H, x] .
(7.1)
We can integrate Eq. (7.1) to get
x(T) −x(0) =

(7.2)
1Such phenomena as the Josephson junction, superconductivity, and magnetoresistance in metal loops show that
quantum effects are not restricted to microscopic systems. See Sects. 4.6–7.

Figure 7.1: Graph of v(t) and ∆v(t) in the thought experiment
of Sect. 7.1.
Note that Eq. (7.2) is an operator equation. During the measurement the particle is not free,
so we cannot replace v(t) by p/m. However, if measuring the velocity does not change it, we
can replace v(t) by v(0) to get
x(T) = x(0) + v(0)T .
We can estimate the uncertainty in x(T) from the uncertainties in x(0) and v(0):
[∆x(T)]2 = [∆x(0)]2 + [∆v(0)]2T 2 .
(7.3)
For T arbitrarily small, the uncertainty in x hardly increases as a result of the measurement;
yet the measurement decreases the uncertainty in the velocity. So once the measurement is
complete and the particle moves freely again, the product of uncertainties ∆x(T) · ∆v(T)
violates the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. Either the Heisenberg uncertainty relations are
wrong, or we were wrong in assuming that we can measure velocity in an arbitrarily short time
without changing it. Either way, we conclude that the Heisenberg uncertainty relations do not
fully account for what we can and cannot measure in quantum mechanics.
What about the time-energy uncertainty relation? Doesn’t it apply to the velocity paradox?
According to one interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relation, a measurement of
energy to an accuracy ∆E takes a time at least T ≥ℏ/∆E. Before the velocity measurement
began, the particle was free, hence a measurement of its velocity also measured its kinetic
energy. If so, we cannot assume that T is arbitrarily short or that ∆v(T) ≪∆v(0), and there
is no paradox.
However, we must be careful how we interpret the time-energy uncertainty relation. (See
Chap.8.) EnergyisaHermitianoperator, butthetimetinSchr¨odinger’sequationisaparameter,
not an operator. There is no Hermitian operator T such that [T, H] = iℏ(the analogue of
[x, p] = iℏ). The proof is that [T, H] = iℏimplies that H has no lower bound; but H = p2/2m
cannot be negative. (See Prob. 7.1.) We can derive a time-energy uncertainty relation from the
position-momentum uncertainty relation, as in Prob. 2.8, but we cannot then use it to prove
the latter relation.
7.2
A Quantum Measurement Paradigm
As a step towards treating quantum measurements, let us review a standard experiment for
measuring a quantum observable – spin. We can extract, from this experiment, a paradigm for
all quantum measurements.

Figure 7.2: An atom passes between two large
magnets in a Stern-Gerlach apparatus to measure
the spin component Sz of the atom.
A standard experimental setup to measure spin is the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Figure 7.2
depicts this setup schematically. An atom with z-component of spin Sz enters from the left,
along the x-axis. It encounters an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B near the origin. The
Hamiltonian for the interaction of the spin with the ﬁeld is [1]
Hint = −µS · B ;
it is the potential energy of a magnetic dipole of moment µS in a magnetic ﬁeld B. As the
atom passes through the ﬁeld, its momentum changes in accord with the Heisenberg equation
of motion:
dp
dt = i
ℏ[Hint, p] = µ∇(S · B) .
Assume that B is parallel to the z-axis, with z-component Bz = Bz, for simplicity.3 Then if the
atom crosses the magnetic ﬁeld in a time T, it acquires transverse momentum µ(∂Bz/∂z)SzT,
proportional to the spin component Sz. A beam of atoms entering the Stern-Gerlach apparatus
splits into beams for each spin component Sz.
What, in this experiment, is essential to quantum measurement?
i) The measurement interaction lasts a limited time T. At all other times the atom and
Stern-Gerlach apparatus are distinct, independent systems.
ii) It produces a change (the deﬂection of the atom) that corresponds to the value of the
observable (Sz).
iii) It does not change the measured observable.
iv) In principle, the interaction time T can be very small (if ∂Bz/∂z is very large). Some-
times a fast measurement is preferable. For example, a measurement of a particle’s position
3Since the ﬁeld depends on z, it cannot be exactly parallel to the z-axis – it would not satisfy Maxwell’s equation
∇· B = 0. So the ﬁeld must fringe away from the z-axis.

97
may change its momentum and thus, in time, its position; then, if the measurement is not fast,
it measures a changed position.
v) The measurement is a quantum process. We treat the atom as a wave packet evolving
along a trajectory through the magnetic ﬁeld and beyond. We can do so only because we wrote
down a Hamiltonian, Hint, for the measurement interaction.
If we accept i)–v) as criteria for quantum measurement, they lead us to a model (due to von
Neumann [2]) for the measurement of an observable As. To satisfy v), we treat the measurement
via an interaction Hamiltonian Hint. According to iii), Hint and As must commute. According
to ii), Hint must couple As to something that yields an observable change, like the deﬂection
of the atom in the measurement of Sz. The simplest coupling we can write down is AsPd,
where Pd is an otherwise independent observable. Since i) requires Hint to be effective only
during the measurement, we multiply AsPd by a coupling g(t) that is different from zero only
in an interval 0 ≤t ≤T, with
 ∞
−∞
g(t)dt =
 T

g(t)dt = g0 .
(7.4)
(See Fig. 7.3.) Finally, iv) implies the limit T →0. In this limit the measurement is termed
impulsive. Our interaction Hamiltonian is
Hint(t) = g(t)AsPd ,
(7.5)
and the total Hamiltonian is
H = Hd + Hs + Hint(t) .
(7.6)
It includes the separate Hamiltonians of the measuring device (Hd) and of the measured system
(Hs).
How does the model work? Because Pd is a quantum operator, some other quantum
operator does not commute with it. Let the operator Qd be conjugate to Pd:
[Qd, Pd] = iℏ.

Quantum Measurements
We prepare the measuring device in an initial state with well deﬁned Qd, say Qd(0) = 0, and
the measured system in a state with well deﬁned As. According to the Heisenberg equation of
motion, the change in Qd during the measurement is

While [Qd, Hd] need not vanish, in the limit of small T the only term remaining in Qd(T)
will be g0As. At the end of the measurement, we ﬁnd the measuring device in a state with
Qd = g0As. (Note that Qd, and not Pd, registers the result of the measurement, although it
is Pd that appears with As in Hint.) We can choose g0 large to get a macroscopic change
in Qd. It is convenient to identify Qd with a pointer on a measuring device, indicating the
measurement result on a dial.
So far, we have discussed quantum measurements in the Heisenberg formalism, in which
an operator As evolves according to Heisenberg’s equation of motion. An advantage of this
formalism is that the classical and quantum equations of motion for As coincide, and we
understand quantum evolution by analogy with classical evolution. We have so far assumed
that the measured system is in an eigenstate of As, so we can replace the operator As by one
of its eigenvalues. What if the measured system is not in an eigenstate of As? Chapter 9
addresses this question. (See also Prob. 7.2.)
As an application of the model, consider measuring the position of a particle via a local
interaction with a probe particle. The interaction Hamiltonian is
Hint(t) = −g(t)x · X ,
where x is the position of the particle we want to locate (corresponding to As in Eq. (7.5)) and
X is the position of our probe (corresponding to Pd). Aside from the measurement interaction,
the particles are free; their Hamiltonians are
Hs = p2
2m
Hd = P 2
2M ,
where p and P are the momenta conjugate to x and X, respectively. Let g(t) equal g0/T for
0 ≤t ≤T, and 0 otherwise, as in Fig. 7.4. Applying the Heisenberg equation of motion, we
get
˙x = p/m
˙p = g(t)X
˙X = P/M
˙P = g(t)x .
(7.7)
All the dynamical quantities change during the measurement. (See Prob. 7.3.) However, the
dynamics simpliﬁes in the limit T →0. The change in the position coordinates becomes

and if P and p remain ﬁnite for T →0, X and x remain constant in the same limit. We ﬁnd
then that P and p change by a ﬁnite amount,
P(T) −P(0) = g0x ,
p(T) −p(0) = g0X ,
(7.8)
and the change in the momentum of the probe, P(T) −P(0), yields the position x(0).
7.3
Quantum Measurements and Uncertainty Relations
Quantum measurements automatically obey the complementarity principle. Since the interac-
tion Hamiltonian for measuring As contains As, measuring As disturbs any observable that
does not commute with As. Quantum measurements also preserve the Heisenberg uncertainty
relations. We can apply the von Neumann model to show that the uncertainty relations are
consistent, i.e. no measurement can evade them.
Let us start with a special case: the uncertainty relation for position and momentum.
Consider the position measurement of the last section. It is sufﬁcient to consider one component
of position, say x1, and its conjugate momentum p1. Since p(T) = p(0) + g0X, the position
measurement increases the uncertainty in p1(T); even if ∆p1(0) vanishes, we have
∆p1(T) ≥g0∆X1(0) .
(7.9)
We measure x1 from the change in P1/g0, so the uncertainty in the measurement of x1 cannot
be less than the uncertainty in P1/g0; and P1(0) cannot be certain because the measuring
device initially has a well deﬁned pointer position, X1(0). Thus
∆x1(T) ≥∆P1(0)/g0 .
(7.10)

100
7
Quantum Measurements
By multiplying Eqs. (7.9–10) we ﬁnd
∆x1(T)∆p1(T) ≥∆X1(0)∆P1(0) .
(7.11)
If the measuring device were classical, Eq. (7.11) would imply a violation of the uncertainty
relation. But the measuring device is itself a quantum system and ∆X1, ∆P1 satisfy the
uncertainty relation
∆X1(0)∆P1(0) ≥ℏ/2 .
(7.12)
It follows that
∆x1(T)∆p1(T) ≥ℏ/2 .
(7.13)
We assumed the uncertainty relation Eq. (7.12) for X1 and P1; however, we did not assume
Eq. (7.13) for x1 and p1, we derived it from Eq. (7.12). Hence any measuring device satisfying
Eq. (7.12) conﬁrms Eq. (7.13).
We now generalize this proof to the case of two arbitrary observables As and Bs. We
assume an interaction Hamiltonian for a measurement of As,
Hint = g(t)PdAs ,
where g(t) satisﬁes Eq. (7.4). During the measurement, the conjugate variable Qd evolves
from Qd(0) = 0 initially to Qd(T) = g0As at the end of the measurement. If we infer the
value of As from the change in Qd we have, for the uncertainty ∆As,
∆As = ∆Qd/g0 .
We compute uncertainties with respect to the overall state of the measuring device and the
measured system. Let us denote this state as |Ψs, Φd⟩,
|Ψs, Φd⟩= |Ψs⟩⊗|Φd⟩,
where |Ψs⟩completely speciﬁes the state of the measured system and |Φd⟩completely speciﬁes
the state of the measuring device. It is a product state because the measuring device and
measured system are uncorrelated initially. We deﬁne the expectation value of an operator O
to be ⟨Ψs, Φd|O|Ψs, Φd⟩and denote it ⟨O⟩.
During the measurement, any observable Bs of the measured system that does not commute
with As also evolves. The Heisenberg equation of motion for Bs is
dBs
dt
= g(t) i
ℏ[As, Bs]Pd .
We take the expectation value of both sides of the equation. Since the expectation value
of Pd vanishes (the pointer has no momentum initially, and Pd does not change during the
measurement), there is no change in the expectation value of Bs or of [As, Bs]; however, the
uncertainty in ⟨Bs⟩is now at least
∆Bs = g0|⟨[As, Bs]⟩|∆Pd/ℏ,

7.4
Paradox Lost
101
and by multiplying ∆As and ∆Bs we obtain
∆As∆Bs ≥∆Qd|⟨[As, Bs]⟩|∆Pd/ℏ≥1
2|⟨[As, Bs]|⟩,
since ∆Qd∆Pd ≥ℏ/2 by assumption. (Compare Prob. 3.10(b).) Quantum measurements
preserve the uncertainty relations.
7.4
Paradox Lost
In Sects. 7.2–7.3 we have constructed quantum measuring devices to measure an observable
(e.g. position or momentum) instantaneously, without changing it, and shown that they preserve
the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. Let us now revisit the paradox of Sect. 7.1. What about
a measurement of velocity?
A free particle moving in one dimension, with momentum p and mass m, has velocity
v = p/m. We know how to measure p/m. If we apply a measurement interaction Hint =
g(t)Pdp/m to measure the velocity, however, the particle is no longer free, and the velocity is
no longer p/m. The velocity is
v = dx
dt = i
ℏ[H, x] ;
if H = p2/2m + g(t)Pdp/m, then v = p/m + g(t)Pd/m. Clearly, it does not help if we
substitute p/m + g(t)Pd/m for p/m in Hint; we merely ﬁnd that velocity has again changed
from what it was, and that our measuring device no longer measures velocity.
We arrived at a model of quantum measurement by assuming, with von Neumann, that
coupling a measurement to an observable As does not change As. We now discover that we
cannot couple a measurement to the velocity v without changing v. Must we discard the von
Neumann model? No, the von Neumann model is correct as it applies to x and p and all other
canonical quantities.4 But, in general, it does not apply to noncanonical physical observables
such as velocity and other time derivatives of canonical observables. A measurement of a
noncanonical observable ˙As in general changes ˙As. (See Probs. 7.8–7.9.)
The von Neumann model has no place for noncanonical observables because the Hamil-
tonian has no place for them. There is no direct way to write down a Hamiltonian with a
coupling to a noncanonical observable such as v. However, the problem with measuring non-
canonical observables extends beyond Hamiltonian mechanics. In Lagrangian mechanics it is
straightforward to write down a coupling to v:
L = m
2 ˙x2 + M
2
˙Q2
d + g(t) ˙xQd .
(7.14)
The term g(t) ˙xQd deﬁnes a measurement coupling directly to v = ˙x. If g(t) = g0/T for a time
T, the change in M ˙Qd measures v. But again, v during the measurement is not what it would be
if there were no measurement; the Lagrange equations of motion yield v = v(0) −g(t)Qd/m,
4Canonical quantities are the generalized coordinates qi and momenta pi satisfying ˙qi = ∂H/∂pi, ˙pi =
−∂H/∂qi for some function H(qi, pi, t).

and the change in Pd indeed measures v, but v during the measurement is not p/m but
[p −g(t)Qd] /m.
The problem with the extra term −g(t)Qd/m in v is not that it prevents us from measuring
velocity. The problem is that it contributes to the uncertainty in v. Let ∆Qd(0) and ∆Pd(0)
denote the uncertainties in Qd and Pd, respectively, at the beginning of the measurement. If
∆Qd(0) is small, then ∆Pd(0) is large. But the measured value of v is [Pd(T) −Pd(0)]/g0;
the uncertainty in the velocity measurement depends both on Pd(0) and, through Pd(T), on
Qd(0). Minimizing ∆Qd(0) conﬂicts with minimizing ∆Pd(0), and so there is a minimum
uncertainty in the measured value of v:
∆v ≥

ℏ/mT .
(7.15)
(See Prob. 7.10.) Equation (7.15) resolves the velocity paradox of Sect. 7.1. Now the un-
certainty in x at time T is at least T∆v while the uncertainty in p at time T is at least m∆v,
i.e.
∆x(T) · ∆p(T) ≥(T∆v)(m∆v) ≥ℏ,
consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty relation. However, Eq. (7.15) can be misleading. Be-
ware! Our discussion of quantum measurements is not complete.5 The next chapter completes
the treatment of noncanonical observables.

8 Measurement and Compensation
The last chapter presents von Neumann’s model for measurements of canonical quantities.
The model has many applications, and Sect. 7.4 applies it to resolve the velocity paradox of
Sect. 7.1. However, we may not be comfortable with the resolution of the paradox. Velocity is
not a canonical quantity, but it is gauge invariant: mv = p−eA/c. (See Prob. 4.3.) The model
implies that a velocity measurement lasting a time T yields v with uncertainty ∆v ≥

ℏ/mT.
(See Prob. 7.10.) Yet the same model implies that we can measure momentum instantaneously,
with no minimum uncertainty, and without changing it. We can also measure p −eA/c
instantaneously, with no minimum certainty, and without changing it; A is a canonical variable.
But p −eA/c equals mv (except during the measurement) so why can’t we measure velocity
instantaneously? Likewise, in the laboratory we measure electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and
B, not the potentials A and V that appear in the Hamiltonian, Eq. (4.7). The magnetic ﬁeld
B = ∇× A is a canonical quantity, but the electric ﬁeld is not (although it is gauge invariant),
because it depends on the derivative of A with respect to time: E = −(1/c)(∂A/∂t) −∇V .
Why can’t we measure E instantaneously?
The question of measuring E troubled such physicists as Landau, Peierls, Bohr and Rosen-
feld. Rosenfeld arrived at Bohr’s institute in early 1931 just as the question had come to a
head. He ran into Gamow and asked what was new. Gamow answered with a drawing he had
just made. It showed Landau, tightly bound to a chair and gagged, while Bohr stood before
him with upraised ﬁnger, saying “Please, please, Landau, can I just get a word in!” Landau
and Peierls had come a few days before with a new paper to show Bohr, “but he does not seem
to agree,” said Gamow airily, “and this is the kind of discussion which has been going on all
the time.” Peierls had left the previous day, “in a state of complete exhaustion,” added Gamow.
Landau stayed on for a few weeks, and Rosenfeld discovered that “Gamow’s representation
of the situation was only exaggerated to the extent usually conceded to artistic fantasy” [1].
Landau and Peierls had considered measuring the electric ﬁeld by sending a charged test par-
ticle through it [2]. The electric ﬁeld deﬂects the test charge; the change in the momentum
of the charge indicates the ﬁeld strength. But an accelerated charge radiates and loses an un-
known part of its momentum to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. (See Prob. 8.1.) We can suppress
the radiation by reducing the charge on the test particle; then the momentum of the particle
changes more slowly, but the measurement lasts longer. An impulsive, accurate measurement
of the electric ﬁeld is impossible. Bohr felt uneasy, but could not refute the claim of Landau
and Peierls.
Ultimately, Bohr and Rosenfeld did refute the claim; it took them nearly three years [3],
but they showed how to measure electric and magnetic ﬁelds instantaneously [4]. Bohr and
Rosenfeld did not treat noncanonical observables in general. We will see that in the von

Measurement and Compensation
Neumann model it is straightforward to measure any noncanonical observable instantaneously;
we only have to apply the model differently to noncanonical observables. In the next section
we consider measuring energy, including kinetic energy, in von Neumann’s model. Kinetic
energy is a noncanonical observable, since it depends on the velocity v. An application of the
uncertainty relation for energy and time indicates that we cannot measure E instantaneously.
The paradox is that we can!
8.1
Paradox Regained
Numerous papers and books claim that a measurement of energy cannot take an arbitrarily
short time. They interpret the energy-time uncertainty relation, Eq. (2.10), as follows: the
faster the energy measurement, the more uncertain the result. Let us examine some arguments
for this interpretation.
i)AsimpleargumentstartswithEinstein’sequationrelatingenergyandfrequency, Eq.(2.3):
E = hν. Suppose a quantum wave takes a time T to pass through a measuring device. Since
the wave lasts a time T, its Fourier transform is large for frequencies in a range that includes
0 ≤ν ≤1/T. Then ∆E = h∆ν ≥h/T.
ii) Suppose we have a system in its ground state of energy E0. We want to prepare it in a
ﬁnal state of energy E, with E in its continuous energy spectrum. We apply a perturbation that
oscillates in time with angular frequency ω = (E −E0)/ℏ, lasting a time T. That is, it takes
us time T to measure (prepare) the ﬁnal state of energy E. But the perturbation might excite
the system to a state of a different energy E′ instead. The relative probability of a transition to
a ﬁnal state of energy E′ is approximately
sin2 [(E′ −E0)T/2ℏ−ωT/2]
[(E′ −E0) −ℏω]2
= sin2 [(E′ −E)T/2ℏ]
(E′ −E)2
.
(8.1)
(See Prob. 6.11.) Figure 8.1 shows a graph of Eq. (8.1) as a function of E′ −E. The dominant
peak, lying between −h/T and h/T, contains over 90% of the area, so with probability 90%
the ﬁnal energy of the system will lie between E −h/T and E + h/T, i.e. ∆E ≥h/T again.
iii) We may measure the kinetic energy of a particle by hitting it with a probe particle.
Consider a particle of initial energy ei and momentum pi in an elastic collision with a probe
particle of initial energy Ei and momentum Pi. For simplicity, let the particles have equal
masses m and move on a line. Since the collision conserves total energy and momentum, the
ﬁnal kinetic energies of the probe particle and measured particle are Ef = ei and ef = Ei,
respectively. And since Ef = P 2
f /2m and Ei = P 2
i /2m, we measure ei or ef by measuring
Pf or Pi, respectively. Hence a measurement of either ei or ef can be impulsive and accurate.
But the more accurately we measure Pf or Pi, the greater the uncertainty in Xf or Xi, the
respective position of the probe. Without knowing where the probe particle is, we cannot know
the time of the collision. Then how long does the measurement take? If we measure Pi, we
prepare a state of energy ef = P 2
i /2m after the collision; but we must await the collision a
time T not less than ∆Xi divided by the initial speed of the probe:
T ≥∆Xi
Pi/m ≥

(See Prob. 3.10.) Thus, to measure (prepare) the state of energy ef takes a time T ≥ℏ/2∆ef.
What if we measure Pf? We must measure Pf after the collision to obtain ei before the
collision. Even if ∆Xi vanishes, ∆xi does not, and we must wait a time
T ≥∆xi
pi/m ≥

2pi∆pi/m =

for the collision. Thus a measurement of ei lasts a time T ≥ℏ/2∆ei.
iv) We can apply Eq. (7.15), which states that if a measurement of velocity v takes a time
T, the uncertainty in v during the measurement is ∆v ≥

ℏ/mT. The uncertainty in the
kinetic energy, E = mv2/2, during the measurement is ∆E = mv∆v. Thus
(∆E)2 = m2v2(∆v)2 ≥m2v2(ℏ/mT) = 2Eℏ/T .
(8.4)
To measure E (and not just bound E from above) we need ∆E ≤E. Thus Eq. (8.4) implies
∆E ≥2ℏ/T .
(8.5)
Arguments i) – iv) suggest that there is no way to measure energy impulsively. From
Eqs. (8.2–3) and (8.5) we conclude
T∆E ≥ℏ/2 ,
(8.6)
with the interpretation that T is the time it takes to measure E (whether E is the energy before,
during, or after the measurement).
Nevertheless, there are arguments against this interpretation. The Heisenberg uncertainty
relations for two operators A, B follow directly from Eq. (4.15), ∆A∆B ≥1
2|⟨[A, B]⟩|. But
time is not an operator in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics; there is no operator T such
that [T, E] = iℏ. (See Sect. 7.1 and Prob. 7.1.) Hence Eq. (8.6) remains unproved. The
measurements in i) – iv) obey Eq. (8.6), but other measurements may not. Also, Eq. (8.6) is an
odd exception to the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. The other uncertainty relations refer to

108
8
Measurement and Compensation
two properties of a measured system – position and momentum, etc. Eq. (8.6) refers, instead, to
a property of the measured system (energy) and a property of the measuring device (how long
the measurement lasts). An analogous interpretation of ∆p∆x ≥ℏ/2 would be the following:
a device to measure momentum with accuracy ∆p can be no smaller than ∆x ≥ℏ/2∆p.
This interpretation is false! For example, a very heavy atom in its ground state is a device
to measure photon momentum. If a photon excites the atom to a state with lifetime T, the
uncertainty in the photon energy is ∆E ≥ℏ/T; hence the uncertainty in its momentum is
∆p = ∆E/c ≥ℏ/cT. The time the photon leaves the atom is uncertain, with uncertainty T,
so ∆x ≈cT and ∆x∆p ≥ℏ. But the size of the atom may be much less than cT.
Now consider the following interaction Hamiltonian for measuring energy:
Hint(t) = g(t)HsPd ,
where the coupling g(t) obeys
 T
0 g(t)dt = g0. As in Eq. (7.6), the total Hamiltonian for the
measuring device and the measured system is
H = Hd + Hs + Hint(t) .
As long as Hint is nonzero, we cannot identify Hs with the energy of the measured system.
But the equation of motion for Qd,
dQd
dt
= i
ℏ[H, Qd] = i
ℏ[Hd, Qd] + g(t)Hs ,
implies that the total change in Qd during the measurement is
Qd(T) −Qd(0) = i
ℏ
 T
0
dt[Hd, Qd] + g0Hs ;
(8.7)
the second term on the right side of Eq. (8.7), divided by g0, is the energy of the system before
and after the measurement. Moreover, the time T is arbitrary; even if [Qd, Hd] is nonzero, for
T small we obtain g0Hs as the change in Qd during the measurement. We measure the energy
of the system in an arbitrarily short time, and the ﬁnal energy is unchanged from the initial
energy!
This conclusion [5] contradicts Eq. (8.6) and its interpretation. If it is correct, then Hint
must represent a measurement we have so far not considered. What is this measurement?
8.2
Compensating Forces
Section 7.4 describes a measurement of velocity v according to the interaction Hamiltonian
Hint = g(t) p

(8.8)
and shows that measuring v changes v. Yet if we calculate Qd(T)−Qd(0) with this interaction

Compensating Forces

Even if [Hd, Qd] ̸= 0, for T small we can neglect the integral; then Qd measures p/m, a
constant of the motion equal to v before and after the measurement. This velocity measurement
is analogous to the energy measurement at the end of the last section. What measurement does
it represent?
We sometimes gain insight into a quantum problem by considering – with great care –
the corresponding classical problem. The classical problem of measuring velocity (unlike the
quantum problem) allows us to start with a Lagrangian, in which velocities appear explicitly.
Suppose we try to measure the velocity v of a particle of mass m via a probe particle of mass
M. A possible Lagrangian is
L = 1
2MV 2 + 1
2mv2 + g(t)v · X .
(Compare Eq. (7.14).) L contains, besides the kinetic energies of the two particles, an inter-
action term that couples v to the position X of the probe. This term resembles the interaction
Hamiltonian of Eq. (8.8). L leads to the following equations of motion:
d
dt(MV) = g(t)v
(8.9a)
d
dt [mv + g(t)X] = 0 .
(8.9b)
According to Eq. (8.9a), the change in MV during the measurement is exactly v. If v were a
constant of the motion, Eq. (8.9a) would represent a measurement of v. However, Eq. (8.9b)
tells us that v is not a constant of the motion – it changes drastically, although it returns
to its original value at the end of the measurement. Even so, we have solved the classical
problem, because classical physics allows us to measure g(t)X/m, the change in v during the
measurement, as well as MV. But we have not solved the quantum problem, because quantum
physics does not allow us to measure both X and MV, and we need both to obtain v.
We might try to change Eq. (8.9b) to make v a constant of the motion. But v cannot be
a constant of the motion if it couples to anything. On the other hand, we can try changing
Eq. (8.9a) so that dMV/dt equals v+g(t)X/m, which is a constant of the motion. By adding
a term to L we get a Lagrangian L′
L′ = L + 1
2m [Xg(t)]2
= 1
2MV 2 + 1
2mv2 + g(t)v · X + 1
2m [Xg(t)]2 ,
leading to the equations of motion
d
dt(MV) = g(t) [v + g(t)X/m]
(8.10a)
d
dt [mv + g(t)X] = 0 .
(8.10b)
Now dMV/dt equals v + g(t)X/m, still a constant of the motion since Eqs. (8.9b) and
(8.10b) are identical. The total change in MV during the measurement equals the velocity v
before and after the measurement. Thus, we can measure v by arranging for an additional force
[g(t)]2X/m to act on the probe; this force compensates for the uncontrolled change in v during
the measurement by inducing the same change in MV, so the total change in MV equals v.

110
8
Measurement and Compensation
The force is like a time-dependent spring acting on the probe particle. Since it depends on X
it is totally uncertain; however, we don’t need to know what it is in order to measure v.
The Hamiltonian corresponding to L′ is
H =
1
2M P 2 + 1
2m [p −g(t)X]2 −1
2m [Xg(t)]2
= P 2
2M + p2
2m −g(t) p
m · X ;
(8.11)
it is identical to the Hamiltonian for measuring position in Sect. 7.2 except that p/m has taken
the place of x in the interaction term. The two equivalent expressions for H in Eq. (8.11)
show that a measurement of v, including the compensating force on the probe, is identical to
a measurement of p/m. The change in P during the measurement yields p/m, which is the
velocity before and after the measurement. (See also Prob. 8.4.) So measuring velocity is
indeed as simple as measuring momentum.
8.3
Quantum Measurements of Noncanonical Observables
It is straightforward to generalize this velocity measurement; once we know how to measure
velocity, we know how to measure any noncanonical variable. Let A denote a noncanonical
observable of a system before, during and after a measurement. In general, the deﬁnition of A
involves H, the total Hamiltonian of the system and measuring device, including an interaction
Hamiltonian, as well as canonical observables of the system and their commutators with H.
Because A is a noncanonical observable, it changes during the measurement. Let As denote
the same observable before and after a measurement. The difference in the deﬁnition of As and
A is the following: everywhere that H appears in the deﬁnition of A, Hs takes its place in the
deﬁnition of As. For example, if A = [H, O] for some operator O, then As = [Hs, O]. Yet the
prescription for measuring a noncanonical variable is to put As, and not A, in the interaction
Hamiltonian:
Hint(t) = g(t)AsPd .
Although As differs from A during the measurement, at the beginning and end of the mea-
surement A = As. We now summarize the general treatment of noncanonical observables as
follows:
i) The total Hamiltonian for the measurement is H = Hs + Hd + g(t)AsPd. In general, H
entails compensating forces on the measuring device.
ii) The value of the noncanonical observable is the same before and after the measurement,
although its deﬁnition changes during the measurement.
iii) The measurement yields the value of the noncanonical observable before and after, not
during, the measurement.
So, if we only interpret it properly, von Neumann’s model extends to measurements of
noncanonical variables. In the next section we apply the model to the problem of measuring
the electric ﬁeld impulsively (one of the problems that Bohr and Rosenfeld solved).

8.4
Measuring the Electric Field
111
For any noncanonical observable, Hint entails compensating forces on the measuring de-
vice. The Hamiltonian often hides these compensating forces, but they appear in the equations
of motion for the noncanonical observables. There may also be compensating forces in mea-
surements of canonical observables. For example, Sect. 7.2 discusses a measurement of the
position of a particle using a probe particle and the interaction Hamiltonian Hint = −g(t)x·X.
This measurement yields x in the limit of an impulsive measurement. However, we can obtain
the average value of x during a time T from a measurement that is not impulsive. The Hamilto-
nian for such a measurement contains, in addition to Hint(t), a term representing compensating
forces on the probe particle. The compensating forces depend on Hs. (See Probs. 8.6 and
8.7.)
How do we know when a nonimpulsive measurement of As, a canonical variable, requires
compensating forces? Consider the commutator [[As, H], As]. It contains the commutator
[As, H], whichisproportionalto ˙As. If ˙As doesnotcommutewith As, i.e. if[[As, H], As] ̸= 0,
then ˙As does not commute with the measurement interaction Hint(t) = g(t)AsPd; thus the
measurement changes the evolution of As(t) from what it would have been in the absence of
the measurement, and the measurement requires compensating forces.
8.4
Measuring the Electric Field
In this treatment of noncanonical observables, we do not have to invent compensating forces for
each new measurement; the compensating forces come out automatically. Thus the derivation
of measurement interactions is simpler. To illustrate the treatment, we can show how to measure
the electric ﬁeld impulsively [6], as did Bohr and Rosenfeld.
Suppose we want to measure Ex. Following Bohr and Rosenfeld, we measure Ex(x)
folded with a rigid charge distribution: our measuring device is a heavy, charged sphere, of
diameter D, in the electric ﬁeld. The sphere is free to move only in the x-direction; let X
denote the coordinate of its center of mass. The Hamiltonian for the measuring device is
Hd = P 2
2M ,
with [X, P] = iℏ. We treat the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge ∇· A = 0. In
this gauge, the scalar potential A0 = V is the instantaneous Coulomb potential arising from
any charges; it decouples from the radiation ﬁeld [7]. (See Probs. 8.8–9.) The Hamiltonian
for the radiation ﬁeld is a sum over modes with propagation vectors k and angular frequencies

iℏ(δij −kikj/k2)δk,k′. (See Prob. 8.11.) The commutation relations are unusual because
Ak,1, Ak,2 and Ak,3 are not all independent degrees of freedom: the gauge condition implies
k · Ak = 0, so for each wave vector k there are only two degrees of freedom, ϵ1 · Ak and
ϵ2 · Ak, where ϵ1 and ϵ2 are unit vectors orthogonal to k. Equivalently, we can write
[ϵi · Ak, ϵj · Πk′] = iℏδijδk,k′ .

Measurement and Compensation
For simplicity, we assume that there are no charges aside from the test charge. Then V = 0
and the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the canonical momentum; we have1
Π(x) =

4πc2
d
dtA(x) = −1
4πcE(x) .
Then for measuring Ex(x) our prescription tells us to couple the measuring device to the
momentum Πx(x). The coupling includes the charge distribution ρ(x) of the sphere, since we
measure Ex folded with this rigid charge distribution. So the interaction Hamiltonian is
Hint = −g(t)X

where ϵ1,x and ϵ2,x are the x-components of ϵ1 and ϵ2, respectively. (See also Prob. 8.12.) In
the impulsive limit, X and Πk,x do not change (since P and A−k,x remain ﬁnite). Thus the
change in P over the course of the measurement is g0

k ρkΠk,x. Now Ex changes during
the measurement (although Πx does not) but before and afterwards it is proportional to Πx, so
the change in P measures

To ﬁnd out what compensating forces act on the charge, we can compute the Lagrangian

Energy and Time

Then the change in P measures what the average value of

d3xEx(x)ρ(x) would have been
in the absence of a measurement. (See Prob. 8.13.) From Eq. (8.16) we learn what impulsive
means for this measurement. We assume that Πk does not change during the measurement
(since T is short and A−k is ﬁnite). But this assumption is not consistent with Eq. (8.14) if ω
is arbitrarily large. It is consistent with Eq. (8.14) for ωT ≪1 (as we see by combining the
equations of motion for Πk and A−k) and, indeed, the condition ωT ≪1 reduces Eq. (8.16)
to Eq. (8.15). When does this condition hold? The measuring device cannot couple to modes
with wavelengths that are much smaller than the size D of the rigid charge distribution, i.e.
to frequencies that are much larger than c/D. The decoupling of frequencies greater than
about c/D implies the condition ωT ≪1 if D ≫cT. Thus if D ≫cT, the measurement is
impulsive.
As noted in the last section, measurements of canonical quantities, too, may require com-
pensating forces. In particular, measurements of canonical ﬁelds – including the magnetic
ﬁeld – may require compensating forces. Every measurement, even an impulsive measure-
ment, lasts a time T > 0. But for any T, there are modes with periods much shorter than
T. If the measurement couples to these modes, it will yield time-averaged values and require
compensating forces.
8.5
Energy and Time
Section 8.2 indicates that it is an error to interpret ∆T in
∆E∆T ≥ℏ/2
(8.17)
as the time it takes to measure energy with uncertainty ∆E. Sect. 8.2 also suggests the source
of the error: If a measurement lasts a time ∆T, then the uncertainty in the energy during the
measurement satisﬁes Eq. (8.17). However, the uncertainty in the energy before and after the
measurement need not satisfy Eq. (8.17). On the other hand, an uncertainty relation for energy
and time is at the heart of the clock-in-the-box paradox of Sect. 2.4. How do we interpret it?
As noted in Sect. 8.1, the other Heisenberg uncertainty relations refer to two properties of a
measured system, such as position and momentum. To conform to them, Eq. (8.17) must refer
to the time of the measured system, not of the measuring device. What deﬁnes the time of the
measured system? An event – for example, a quantum jump – deﬁnes a time of the system. So
does an observable that changes smoothly in time – its evolution measures time. We call this
time the internal time of the system to distinguish it from the external time of the measuring
device. If we review the clock-in-the-box paradox as well as arguments i)–iv) for Eq. (8.6) and
its interpretation, we ﬁnd they are compatible with Eq. (8.17) if T refers to internal time.
It is not hard to show rigorously that this interpretation is correct. Let As be some observable
of a system that changes in time. For example, As could be the position of a particle. We
deﬁne the internal time of the system to be the operator
T =
As
⟨dAs/dt⟩= ℏ
As
|⟨[As, Hs]⟩| ,

114

Measurement and Compensation
where Hs is the Hamiltonian of the system. The uncertainty in this time is
∆T = ℏ
∆As
|⟨[As, Hs]⟩| .
(8.18)
For example, if a particle moves at constant speed v, the uncertainty in the time it deﬁnes by
its motion is ∆x/v. If we multiply Eq. (8.18) on both sides by the uncertainty in the energy of
the system, ∆E = ∆Hs, we have
∆T∆E = ℏ∆As∆Hs
|⟨[As, Hs]⟩| .
Equation (4.15) implies that ∆As∆Hs ≥|⟨[As, Hs]⟩|/2, so Eq. (8.17) follows.
Sections 8.1–2 show how to measure the energy of a system accurately in arbitrarily
short external time. These sections tacitly assume that the Hamiltonian Hs of the system
is already known. If the Hamiltonian is not known, neither is the interaction Hamiltonian
Hint = g(t)HsPd assumed for the energy measurement; then the conclusions of Sects. 8.1–2
do not apply, and a measurement of energy to accuracy ∆E does require [8] a minimum time
∆T, where ∆E∆T ≈ℏ. Indeed, even if we think we know the Hamiltonian Hs, we may
be mistaken; then an arbitrarily short measurement would not yield the correct energy and we
would also not discover our mistake.
This minimum time ∆T is internal time. The internal time T, unlike the external time,
depends on Hs. A measurement of energy requires a minimum time ∆T because a system with
Hamiltonian Hs evolves in time ∆T according to the unitary transformation e−iHs∆T/ℏ≈
1 −iHs∆T/ℏ. If Hs is unknown, we estimate it from the second term in this expansion,
which is proportional to ∆T. So again, it is the system’s internal time – the time deﬁned by
its evolution – that appears in the uncertainty relation for energy and time.
Problems
8.1 (a) Suppose we measure the electric ﬁeld E inside a capacitor by sending a charged test

that the uncertainty in the measured value of the ﬁeld strength is ∆p/eT, where p is the
transverse momentum of the particle, e its charge and T the time it takes to pass through
the capacitor. (Neglect fringing of the electric ﬁeld outside the capacitor.) Thus for
large enough e, an accurate measurement of the electric ﬁeld could be arbitrarily short.
(b) The uncertainty ∆x in the transverse position of the particle cannot be greater
than the separation of the the capacitor plates; the particle must not touch the plates.
Show that ∆p ≤m∆x/T and that the transverse acceleration a of the particle satisﬁes
a ≤∆x/T 2.
(c) According to Larmor’s nonrelativistic formula [9], the rate at which a particle of
charge e and acceleration a radiates energy is 2e2a2/3c2 (where c is the speed of
light). Show that this rate implies a transverse momentum loss, over time T, of about
2e2∆x/3c3T 2. Since the momentum loss is uncertain, the uncertainty in the measure-

8.2 The neutral kaons (K-mesons) KL and KS have slightly different masses mL and mS
and very different lifetimes τL and τS:

here, |KL⟩and |KS⟩are also eigenstates of CP. But experiments show that neutral
kaon interactions are not quite invariant under CP, so |KL⟩and |KS⟩are not quite these
linear combinations. It follows from the spin-statistics theorem [12] that the interactions
are also not invariant under time reversal.

Initially, two heavy capacitors of length L move with speed V up the y-axis. The
particle, of charge e, moves parallel to the x-axis with speed vx (to be measured). The
capacitors exert a force of magnitude eE on the particle, either to the right (inside the
ﬁrst capacitor) or to the left (inside the second capacitor).

the measurement. Thus, in this limit, H′ and H lead to equivalent measurements with
compensation. Why are the measurements equivalent only in the limit of an impulsive
measurement?

for a free particle of mass m. Here x is the coordinate of the free particle and X is
the coordinate of a probe particle. Assume that X is nearly constant during the interval
0 ≤t ≤T. Show that the momentum P conjugate to X yields a measurement of the
velocity, and hence the energy, of the measured particle, and that the second interaction
at time t = T restores to the measured particle its original velocity. Thus we can evade
the conclusion of this argument (Eq. (8.6) and its interpretation).

9 Quantum Cats
Following von Neumann, we have deﬁned a general quantum measurement by treating the
measuring device as a quantum system. Quantum measurements are an essential tool for
investigating quantum mechanics, but they lead to a paradox. We have avoided this paradox
by discussing quantum measurements in the Heisenberg formalism. Heisenberg’s equations
of motion are convenient because they are identical to the corresponding classical equations
of motion, but the identity is only formal and obscures the paradox. In this chapter, we look at
quantum measurements in the Schr¨odinger formalism, and the paradox hits us over the head.
The paradox is not a mere artifact of the von Neumann model. It arises from the division of
the world into quantum and classical parts, with measuring devices residing in the classical part.
But even if the measuring devices reside in the quantum part – as in quantum measurements
– the division remains, for observers reside in the classical part; observations are actual, not
just possible. The division of the world into classical and quantum parts is paradoxical. A
revolution replaces an old system with a new one; but in quantum mechanics, the new system
depends on the old one, classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics is an unﬁnished revolution.
9.1
Schr¨odinger’s Cat
The paradox can arise in any quantum measurement. For example, consider an atom with
spin ℏ/2. An interaction Hamiltonian for measuring the z-component of the spin of the atom,
Sz = ℏσz/2, is
Hint(t) = g(t)PdSz .
(9.1)
The momentum Pd is conjugate to the coordinate Qd of the measuring device. The measuring
device could be a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, as in Sect. 7.2; then Qd would correspond to the
transverse deﬂection of the atom. However, we are not concerned here with the apparatus; we
simply identify Qd with the position of a pointer on a measuring device. As in Eq. (7.4), g(t)
is nonzero only for 0 ≤t ≤T and satisﬁes
 T
0
dt g(t) = g0 .
We assume that the measurement is impulsive (T →0) so that we can regard Hint as the total
Hamiltonian during the measurement. Then in the Heisenberg formalism, Qd(T) −Qd(0) =
 T
0 dt ˙Qd(t) = g0Sz.

In the Schr¨odinger formalism, quantum states evolve in time. Suppose the initial spin state
of the atom is | ↑⟩, where | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩represent spin up and down the z-axis, respectively. Let
the initial state of the measuring device be sharply peaked around Qd = 0, and denote it |0⟩.
The combined initial state is
|Ψ(0)⟩= | ↑, 0⟩≡| ↑⟩⊗|0⟩.
The time evolution operator during the measurement (when Hint dominates the rest of the
Hamiltonian) is
U(T, 0) = e−i
 T
0 dt Hint(t)/ℏ= e−ig0Pdσz/2 ,
(9.2)
When U(T, 0) acts on the initial state |Ψ(0)⟩, the operator σz reduces to 1 because |Ψ(0)⟩is
an eigenstate of σz with eigenvalue 1. Then
|Ψ(T)⟩= U(T, 0) |Ψ(0)⟩
= e−ig0Pdσz/2 | ↑, 0⟩
= e−ig0Pd/2 | ↑, 0⟩
= | ↑, g0ℏ/2⟩,
i.e. the pointer is displaced by g0ℏ/2. (See Eq. (5.7).) Likewise, if the initial spin state of the
atom is | ↓⟩, the combined initial state is | ↓, 0⟩≡| ↓⟩⊗|0⟩and evolves during the measurement
to the state | ↓, −g0ℏ/2⟩. The spin Sz does not change, while the pointer on the measuring
device shifts in proportion to Sz, whatever it is – just as in the Heisenberg formalism.
Now what if the initial spin state of the atom is neither | ↑⟩nor | ↓⟩but a superposi-
tion of the two? For example, the initial spin state of an atom polarized along the x-axis
is (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩) /
√

combined initial state is

2 [| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩] ⊗|0⟩=
1
√
2 [| ↑, 0⟩+ | ↓, 0⟩] .
(9.3)
The time evolution operator U(T, 0) is linear, so the state at the end of the measurement is
|Ψ(T)⟩=
1
√
2 [ | ↑, g0ℏ/2⟩+ | ↓, −g0ℏ/2⟩] .
(9.4)
What does this state represent? It represents nothing that we have ever encountered: a measur-
ing device in a superposition of two orthogonal states, corresponding to two different values
of Sz. We are used to superpositions of quantum systems, but not of pointers – we expect the
pointer of a measuring device to be in a deﬁnite position.
Clearly, our treatment of quantum measurements is incomplete; we cannot leave the mea-
suring device in a superposition of states. But clearly, quantum mechanics offers no way to
reduce a superposition of pointer positions to a deﬁnite position. The Schr¨odinger equation
implies that the time evolution operator U(T, 0) is unitary and linear. (See Sect. 5.5.) Since it
is linear, it preserves superpositions, as we just saw. Since it is unitary, it preserves the scalar
product between any two states. If U(T, 0) could evolve the initial state |Ψ(0)⟩in Eq. (9.3)

9.1
Schr¨odinger’s Cat
123
sometimes to |Ψ(T)⟩= | ↑, g0ℏ/2⟩and sometimes to |Ψ(T)⟩= | ↓, −g0ℏ/2⟩, then U(T, 0)
could evolve the same initial state |Ψ(0)⟩to two ﬁnal states that are orthogonal to each other.
Unitarity forbids such evolution.
Unitary evolution cannot reduce the superposition of pointer positions, so von Neumann
postulated a second kind of time evolution: when a measurement is complete, the superposi-
tion of positions collapses to a deﬁnite position. According to this “collapse postulate”, the
superposition |Ψ(T)⟩in Eq. (9.4) then collapses into one of the two product states, | ↑, g0ℏ/2⟩
or | ↓, −g0ℏ/2⟩, with equal probability. The collapse postulate states that if a measurement
leaves the measuring device and measured system in a superposition of product states, the su-
perposition automatically collapses. The probability of each product state equals the absolute
value squared of its coefﬁcient in the superposition. Thus quantum measurements conﬁrm the
statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.
But when is a measurement complete? What is a measuring device? The collapse postulate
leaves these questions open. For example, could the measuring device be another spin? Let
us apply Hint in Eq. (9.1) as follows: alongside Sz = σz/2 which represents the atomic spin,
we deﬁne σd
y and σd
z as Pauli spin matrices for the “measuring device”. We set Pd = σd
y and
g0 = π/2; the initial state of the “measuring device” will be |0⟩d = (| ↑⟩d + | ↓⟩d)/
√
2. The
time evolution operator U(T, 0) in Eq. (9.2) is now
U(T, 0) = e−iπσzσd
y/4 ,
(9.5)
and rotates the “measuring device” in the xz-plane by ±π/2. If the atomic spin state is | ↑⟩,
then U(T, 0) is
U(T, 0) = e−iπσd
y/4 ,
and the ﬁnal state of the two spins is | ↑, ↓⟩≡| ↑⟩⊗| ↓⟩d. If the atomic spin state is | ↓⟩, the
ﬁnal state is | ↓, ↑⟩≡| ↓⟩⊗| ↑⟩d; and if the initial atomic spin state is (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩)/
√
2, the
ﬁnal state of the two spins is
|Ψ(T)⟩=
1
√
2 (| ↑, ↓⟩+ | ↓, ↑⟩) .
(9.6)
The state |Ψ(T)⟩in Eq. (9.6) is entangled. We can experimentally verify that the collapse
postulate does not apply to |Ψ(T)⟩. (See Prob. 9.1.) The collapse postulate does not apply
to this “measuring device”, but it conceivably applies to more complicated systems. How
complicated? Where is the dividing line between unitary time evolution and collapse? The
same questions arise in regard to Bohr’s description of the measurement process.
Schr¨odinger dramatized the question with a thought experiment [1]: “A cat is placed in
a steel chamber, together with the following hellish contraption (which must be protected
against direct interference by the cat): In a Geiger counter there is a tiny amount of radioactive
substance, so tiny that maybe within an hour one of the atoms decays, but equally probably
none of them decays. If one decays then the counter triggers and via a relay activates a little
hammer which breaks a container of cyanide.” (See Fig. 9.1.) So after an hour there is an
equal chance of ﬁnding the cat alive or dead. Schr¨odinger’s initial state |Ψ(0)⟩,
|Ψ(0)⟩= |undecayed⟩⊗|untriggered⟩⊗|unactivated⟩⊗|unbroken⟩⊗|live⟩,

Does the collapse postulate apply to |Ψ(T)⟩or doesn’t it? This question has moral conse-
quences (if the cat dies). If |Ψ(T)⟩collapses before we look into the steel chamber, then
whoever set up the “hellish contraption” is the murderer. But if the state remains |Ψ(T)⟩up to
the time we look into the chamber, we are the murderers – the cat was in a superposition until
we looked.
9.2
A Quantum Catalyst
Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen claimed that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Their claim
may be correct – in a way they did not anticipate, as Sect. 3.5 notes. Quantum mechanics is
incomplete because it does not account for the actual results of measurements. As the paradox
of Schr¨odinger’s cat shows, unitary evolution cannot turn possible results into actual results.
Aware of this paradox, von Neumann postulated collapse. But von Neumann’s collapse is at
best an effective model; it does not resolve the paradox.
Attempts to resolve the paradox fall into three classes, corresponding to three statements:
i) Quantum mechanics is incomplete and there is collapse.
ii) Quantum mechanics is incomplete and there is no collapse.
iii) Quantum mechanics is complete.
Explicit proposals for von Neumann’s collapse are consistent with statement i). A proposal
consistent with statement ii) is Bohm’s theory of hidden variables. (See Sect. 3.5 and Prob. 9.3.)

9.2
A Quantum Catalyst
125
In Bohm’s theory there is no need for collapse, because hidden variables account for the results
of all measurements. Section 9.3 presents a surprising proposal consistent with statement
iii), namely the Everett–Wheeler interpretation of quantum mechanics. How can quantum
mechanics be complete, when unitary evolution cannot turn possible results into actual results?
The answer to this question is surprising indeed.
Proposals to resolve the paradox according to statement i) are radical, in that they all
modify quantum mechanics. They all modify unitary time evolution by postulating some form
of collapse. Here we consider three such proposals.
The ﬁrst proposal is due to Wigner, who noted that we never ﬁnd ourselves in a superposition
of states. If we look at the pointer on a measuring device, we always ﬁnd the pointer in a deﬁnite
position. But according to Eq. (9.4), a pointer may be in a superposition of two positions.
According to Eq. (9.4), if we look at the pointer after a measurement, we too should evolve
into a superposition of two states, one state for each deﬁnite position of the pointer. But we are
not in a superposition! About cats we may have doubts, but not about ourselves. Since Eq. (9.4)
holds for unitary evolution, our evolution cannot be unitary. Wigner [2] suggested that collapse
occurs whenever a conscious human being observes a measuring device in a superposed state.
But this suggestion reduces something that is not well deﬁned (collapse) to something else that
is not well deﬁned (consciousness). The phenomena of science are public while consciousness
is private.
Another proposal, due to Penrose [3], starts with the assumption that there is no way to
quantize gravity without modifying quantum mechanics. Penrose proposed that the superposed
states of any system (not just of measuring devices) collapse under the inﬂuence of gravitational
ﬁelds. Weak gravitational ﬁelds, such as the gravitational ﬁeld of a molecule, do not interfere
with unitary evolution; but strong gravitational ﬁelds modify the evolution by inducing collapse.
The transition from “weak” to “strong” gravity should occur at a scale of about one Planck
mass;1 systems much more massive than the Planck mass would behave classically. So far this
suggestion, too, is not well deﬁned, since quantum gravity is not well deﬁned. Diosi, however,
made a similar and concrete suggestion [4].
The most concrete proposals for collapse are the “Spontaneous Localization” (SL) model
of Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber and the “Continuous Spontaneous Localization” (CSL) model
of Pearle [5]. In both models, extended states of matter spontaneously collapse to localized
states of size a ≈10−5 cm. In the SL model, an extended state ψ(x) can spontaneously
localize to ψ(x)g(x −¯x), where g(x −¯x) is a gaussian of width a centered at x = ¯x. The
probability of such a localization is proportional to

d3x|ψ(x)g(x −¯x)|2 .
Thus the SL model is consistent with Born’s statistical interpretation of the wave function. But
what happens to quantum interference if ψ(x) spontaneously localizes? The answer of the
SL model is that ψ(x) spontaneously collapses, but each second the probability of a “hit” – a
collapse – is about λ = 10−16, i.e. it happens once in about 300 million years on average. For
all practical purposes, the wave function of a given particle never collapses, and so we see such

quantum interference effects as electron diffraction. But a macroscopic object, such as the
pointer on a measuring device, contains many particles. Imagine a pointer in a superposition
of two positions separated by a distance L ≫a. We might represent the initial state |Ψ(0)⟩as
|Ψ(0)⟩=
1
√
2 [|0⟩+ |L⟩] ,
where |0⟩and |L⟩denote wave functions of the pointer position that are sharply peaked at 0 and
at L, respectively. But the pointer contains some 1022 particles, each with degrees of freedom
of its own. Let i index the particles and let |ψ(i)
0 ⟩and |ψ(i)
L ⟩represent the complete wave
function of the i-th particle in the pointer when the pointer position is 0 and L, respectively;
assume |ψ(i)
0 ⟩and |ψ(i)
L ⟩do not overlap. Let us take the terms |0⟩and |L⟩to be tensor products
of these one-particle wave functions:2

The index i runs over N values, with N of order 1022. Suppose that just one of the particles,
say the n-th, spontaneously localizes. That is, its wave function collapses to a new wave
function localized in a region of size a ≪L. The new wave function for the n-th particle
could overlap with either |ψ(n)
0
⟩or |ψ(n)
L ⟩but not both. Thus either |ψ(n)
0
⟩or |ψ(n)
L ⟩would
vanish – and along with it, the corresponding tensor product term in Eq. (9.9). The rate
for this spontaneous localization would be about 1022 × 10−16 sec−1 = 106 sec−1, so the
pointer would have a deﬁnite position after approximately 10−6 seconds; the collapse of any
macroscopic superposition would be extremely rapid.
In the CSL model, the time evolution is continuous rather than sudden. An operator ρ(x, t)
represents the number of particles in a sphere of radius a ≈10−5 cm, centered at x at time t.
(The operator ρ(x, t) could represent the mass, rather than the number, of the particles in the
sphere; if so the CSL model, like Diosi’s model, is a concrete form of Penrose’s suggestion.)
The evolution of a state vector depends on ρ(x, t) and also on a classical ﬁeld w(x, t) with a
measure, i.e. a probability density for each spacetime conﬁguration of w(x, t). (See Prob. 9.4.)
Since the evolution depends on w(x, t), we let |Ψw(t)⟩rather than |Ψ(t)⟩denote the state vector
for t > 0. The evolution equation for |Ψw(t)⟩(which by deﬁnition is a multiparticle wave
function) is

dx [w(x, t) −2λρ(x, t)]2 |Ψw(t)⟩,
(9.10)
where H is the Hamiltonian for the particle. Equation (9.10) assigns a unique nonunitary
evolution |Ψw(t)⟩to each conﬁguration of w(x, t). (It is nonunitary because the norm of
|Ψw(t)⟩may change.) Now the probability density that the initial state vector actually evolves
according to |Ψw(t)⟩during an interval 0 ≤t ≤T is equal to ⟨Ψw(T)|Ψw(T)⟩times the
probability density for the conﬁguration of w(x, t).
2There could be entanglement within |0⟩and |L⟩, but for simplicity (to keep the sum to two terms) we take the
terms to be tensor products.

As a simple application of the CSL model, let us take H = 0 and consider a measuring
device with a pointer consisting of a steel needle, 1 cm long, with cross section 2 × 10−3 cm2.
The initial state is |Ψ(0)⟩of Eq. (9.9); as before, |ψ(i)
0 ⟩and |ψ(i)
L ⟩represent the complete wave
function of the i-th particle in the pointer when the pointer is displaced a distance 0 and L,
respectively. Without representing the operator ρ(x, t) explicitly, we assume that it acts on
each term in the superposition to yield N at any point on the pointer and zero elsewhere, where
N is the number of particles in a steel ball of radius a = 10−5 cm. Since the coefﬁcient of the
integral in Eq. (9.10) is negative, the norm of |Ψw(t)⟩tends to decrease over time; it remains
unchanged only if w(x, t) precisely cancels 2λρ(x, t). Thus of all possible conﬁgurations of
w(x, t), two classes are important for the evolution of |Ψ(0)⟩. One has w(x, t) on average equal
to 2λN at the position of the undisplaced pointer, and zero elsewhere. The other has w(x, t)
on average equal to 2λN at the position of the pointer displaced by L, and zero elsewhere. In
the ﬁrst case |Ψ(0)⟩evolves to the state |0⟩= #
i |ψ(i)
0 ⟩, and in the second case it evolves to
the state |L⟩= #
i |ψ(i)
L ⟩; the collapse takes a time T of order 6 × 10−18 sec. (See Prob. 9.4.)
The CSL model is (so far) consistent with experiment. Unlike the SL model, it preserves
the symmetry or antisymmetry of multiparticle states, because the operator ρ(x, t) commutes
with particle exchange. Pearle has proposed relativistic CSL models for free particles [6]. A
defect of these models, so far, is that the random classical ﬁeld induces production of particles
out of the vacuum.

Quantum Concatenations
The proposals in the previous section, as well as Bohm’s theory, all assume that quantum me-
chanics is incomplete. In 1957 Everett, a student of Wheeler, challenged this assumption. Ev-
erett interpreted quantum mechanics as a theory without collapse. He called his interpretation
the “relative states” formulation of quantum mechanics; it is also known as the Everett-Wheeler
or Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics [7]. Everett and Wheeler proposed that
quantum mechanics, with unitary time evolution, is a complete theory. In this respect only,
the proposal of Everett and Wheeler is conservative where the proposals of the last section are
radical. Quantum mechanics is complete – if we can believe it!
How do Everett and Wheeler resolve the paradox of Schr¨odinger’s cat? Recall the chain
of events. First, an atom may or may not decay. All the other events in the chain involve
macroscopic systems: a Geiger counter, a hammer, a container of cyanide, a cat. The state of
the “hellish contraption” after a hour of time evolution is given by Eq. (9.8). Equation (9.8)
does not tell us whether the cat is dead or alive; it merely offers two possible accounts. If an
atom decayed, all the events involving the macroscopic systems occurred: the Geiger counter
clicked and activated the hammer and the hammer broke the bottle of cyanide, killing the cat.
If no atom decayed, none of the other events took place. Each state represents a completely
self-consistent account. According to Everett and Wheeler, both these accounts are real. In a
single world, only one account can be real. But in many worlds, they can both be real. Many
accounts imply many worlds, hence the name “Many Worlds interpretation”.
To formalize this proposal, let us deﬁne |si⟩to be a set of normalized states of a system
S and |dj⟩a set of normalized states of a system D. Suppose the combined state of the two

128

systems is

ij
cij|si, dj⟩.
In general, the states of S and D are correlated and we cannot deﬁne the state of D alone. The
most we can do is choose a state |sn⟩of the system S and deﬁne the relative state of D (relative
to this state of S) to be
N

j
cnj|dj⟩,
where N is a constant that normalizes the state. The relative state of the system D is simply
the state of D if we project the combined state of S and D onto |sn⟩and normalize. Similarly,
we can deﬁne the state of S relative to a state of D.
We are interested in measurements, so let D be a measuring device acting on the system S.
Let the states |si⟩be eigenstates of some observable and let the measuring device D measure
that observable. It is convenient to let |di⟩be the state of the measuring device indicating that
the system S is in the state |si⟩; that is, at the end of a measurement on S in the state |si⟩, D
is in the state |di⟩. Let the initial state of the measuring device be |d0⟩; the evolution
|si, d0⟩→|si, di⟩,
for any i, deﬁnes the measurement. In general, the initial state of the system S is not one of the
states |si⟩but a superposition 
i ci|si⟩. If the initial combined state is 
i ci|si, d0⟩, unitary
time evolution during the measurement takes this initial state to

i
ci|si, d0⟩→

i
ci|si, di⟩.
The ﬁnal state is a superposition and we cannot deﬁne a state for either S or D alone; at most
we can say that if S is in the state |si⟩, then D is in the relative state |di⟩, and vice versa.
We can generalize this notation and let D(1), D(2), D(3), . . . represent identical measuring
devices (or observers) and S(1), S(2), S(3), . . . represent identical systems on which they may
act. All the measuring devices measure an operator which has normalized eigenstates |s(1)
i ⟩
on system S(1), normalized eigenstates |s(2)
i ⟩on system S(2), and so on. The initial state of
D(1) is |d(1)
0 ⟩, the initial state of D(2) is |d(2)
0 ⟩, and so on. For any system S(m) in an initial
state |s(m)
i
⟩, and for any measuring device D(n), a measurement corresponds to the evolution
|s(m)
i
, d(n)
0 ⟩→|s(m)
i

Now consider a possible measurement scenario:
i) Two measuring devices, D(1) and D(2), measure the same observable on a system S.
D(1) measures ﬁrst, then D(2). The evolution can be described by the sequence

i
ci|si, d(1)
0 , d(2)
0 ⟩→

i
ci|si, d(1)
i , d(2)


i
ci|si, d(1)
i , d(2)
i ⟩.
(9.11)

9.3
Quantum Concatenations
129
Each value of i in the sums of Eq. (9.11) corresponds to a different state of the system S.
Relative to a state |si⟩of S, the combined state of the measuring devices is |d(1)
i , d(2)
i ⟩, so the
two measuring devices always agree. Any number of measuring devices measuring the same
observable on the system S would always agree, relative to the state |si⟩, that S is in the state
|si⟩. Relative to the state |si⟩, measuring devices agree on an account – for each i! According
to the Many Worlds interpretation, each of these accounts is real.
The Many Worlds interpretation boggles the mind, but could it be right? Does it yield
quantum probabilities? Consider measurements on a system S in the initial state c1|s1⟩+c2|s2⟩
with |c1|2 ̸= |c2|2. They yield two different accounts, S in the state |s1⟩and S in the state
|s2⟩. If each of these accounts corresponds to one world, then what do the coefﬁcients c1 and
c2 have to do with probabilities? Why are we more likely to ﬁnd S in one state than in the
other? To answer these questions, we consider two more measurement scenarios:
ii) Let a measuring device D act on identical systems S(1) and S(2), prepared in the same
initial states 
i ci|s(1)
i ⟩and 
j cj|s(2)
j ⟩, respectively. Extending our notation slightly, we
denote by |dij⟩a state of the measuring device that indicates that the system S(1) is in the state
|s(1)
i ⟩and the system S(2) is in the state |s(2)
j ⟩. The initial state of the measuring device is still
|d0⟩. During the measurement the evolution is

ij
cicj|s(1)
i , s(2)
j , d0⟩→

ij
cicj|s(1)
i , s(2)
j , dij⟩.
(iii) Let a measuring device D measure the same observable on many identical systems
S(j), prepared in the same initial state 
i ci|s(j)
i ⟩. During the measurement, the evolution is

ij...
cicj . . . |s(1)
i , s(2)
j , . . . , d0⟩→

ij...
cicj . . . |s(1)
i , s(2)
j , . . . , dij...⟩,
(9.12)
where |dij...⟩extends the notation |dij⟩to measurements on an arbitrary number of identical
systems. The right side of Eq. (9.12) is a superposition of terms representing all the systems
S(1), S(2), . . . in deﬁnite states with the measuring device indicating those states. Thus each
term corresponds to a deﬁnite account of the measurement and each account is incompatible
with all the other accounts.3 Furthermore, each term in the sum in Eq. (9.12) appears with a
coefﬁcient. The term that represents system S(1) in the state |s(1)
i ⟩, system S(2) in the state
|s(2)
j ⟩, system S(3) in the state |s(3)
k ⟩, and so on, appears with coefﬁcient cicjck . . . . The square
of the absolute value of this coefﬁcient is
|cicjck . . . |2 = |ci|2 · |cj|2 · |ck|2 · . . . .
(9.13)
In the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics, Eq. (9.13) represents the probability
that system S(1) is in the state |s(1)
i ⟩, system S(2) is in the state |s(2)
j ⟩, system S(3) is in the
state |s(3)
k ⟩, and so on. What does Eq. (9.13) represent if there is no collapse?
3There could be additional measuring devices besides D in this scenario. However, we have already seen in
scenario i) that all measuring devices agree, relative to states chosen for all the systems. So we can let D stand for all
measuring devices acting on all the systems to measure the same observable.

Everett interpreted Eq. (9.13) as a measure of the account that has S(1) in the state |s(1)
i ⟩,
S(2) in the state |s(2)
j ⟩, S(3) in the state |s(3)
k ⟩, and so on. That is, the correspondence between
worlds and accounts is not one-to-one but many-to-one. To paraphrase Orwell [8], all accounts
are real, but some are more real than others. The measure is what maps coefﬁcients c1 and c2
in an initial state S = c1|s1⟩+ c2|s2⟩to probabilities |c1|2 and |c2|2 of ﬁnal states |s1⟩and
|s2⟩, respectively.
For example, suppose c1 =

1/3 and c2 =

2/3. The measure implies that for every
world in which a measurement yields the ﬁnal state |s1⟩, there are two worlds in which a
measurement yields the ﬁnal state |s2⟩. Let us choose a world at random. How do we choose
a world at random? We measure the ﬁnal state. From the result of our measurement, we know
if we are in the world with ﬁnal state |s1⟩or in one of the two worlds with ﬁnal state |s2⟩.
What is the probability that the ﬁnal state is |s2⟩in the world we choose? The measure insures
that it is 2/3, the quantum probability of the ﬁnal state |s2⟩. In this example, the probabilities
are rational; but even if they are not rational, the measure maps coefﬁcients ci to probabilities
|ci|2.
The mapping arises as follows. Suppose that the probabilities of events E1, E2, E3, . . .
are p1, p2, p3, . . . respectively. Then the probability of a sequence of uncorrelated events
Ei, Ej, Ek, . . . is pi · pj · pk · . . . . The converse is also true: if the probability of a se-
quence of uncorrelated events Ei, Ej, Ek, . . . is pi · pj · pk · . . . , then the probabilities of
events E1, E2, E3, . . . are p1, p2, p3, . . . respectively. In scenario (iii) the sequence of events
i, j, k, . . . (i.e. the sequence of measurements leaving S(1) in the state |s(1)
i ⟩, S(2) in the state
|s(2)
j ⟩, S(3) in the state |s(3)
k ⟩, etc.) has measure |ci|2 ·|cj|2 ·|ck|2 ·. . . . If we choose a world at
random (by making these measurements), the probability of this sequence equals its measure,
|ci|2 · |cj|2 · |ck|2 · . . . . Therefore, the probability that a measurement on a system S(m) will
yield |s(m)
i
⟩in that world is |ci|2, just as quantum mechanics predicts.
Thus in the Many Worlds interpretation, quantum mechanics – with unitary time evolution
– is a complete theory. Quantum mechanics is causal and deterministic, yet it implies the same
experimental predictions as other interpretations of quantum mechanics. Only experimental
predictions about collapse itself would not be the same. If there could be an experiment to
test for collapse, the experiment would test the Many Worlds interpretation. It would also test
Bohm’s theory of hidden variables, in which there is no collapse. (See Sect. 3.4.) But it would
not distinguish between the Many Worlds interpretation and Bohm’s theory.

A Quantum Catalog
This chapter opens with a paradox involving a quantum cat, Schr¨odinger’s cat. The resolution
of this paradox seems to involve more quantum cats. According to Wigner, consciousness
resolves the paradox, so his resolution is a “quantum catharsis”. Penrose’s resolution is a
“quantum catapult” – he throws a large mass at the paradox. The CSL model contains a
“quantum catalyst” – a random ﬁeld that induces collapse but does not itself change. Bohm’s
theory contains “quantum catacombs”, hidden connections across space and time. And in the
Many Worlds interpretation, “quantum concatenations” – unending chains of measurements –
deﬁne the worlds.

All these cats are alive insofar as nothing in experiment or theory kills them; we have not
proved or disproved any of these resolutions.4 Hence the resolution of the paradox remains
a matter of taste. The CSL model is testable, but so far there is no evidence for collapse. To
falsify collapse, on the other hand, we must verify that no superposition ever collapses. For
example, we must show that Schr¨odinger’s cat remains in an entangled state – and in practice,
we have no hope of showing that the state remains entangled. The entangled state is a sum of
two terms, corresponding to the live and dead cat. In Eq. (9.8), each term appears as a tensor
product of ﬁve states. But actually each is a tensor product of countless states representing
every observable inside the steel chamber, such as the position of every atom on the tip of the
cat’s tail. If we lose track of some observables – e.g. if even a few molecules of gas leak out
of the steel chamber – we have lost track of the relative phase between terms, and we cannot
verify the entangled state of Schr¨odinger’s cat. (See Prob. 9.7.)
Hence in practice, we cannot verify the entangled state of Schr¨odinger’s cat. Can we verify
the state in principle? If so, in what sense? In principle, any quantum operator is measurable.
Suppose we measure an operator O having two eigenstates: one is Eq. (9.8) and the other is
1
√
2|undecayed⟩⊗|untriggered⟩⊗|unactivated⟩⊗|unbroken⟩⊗|live⟩
−1
√
2|decayed⟩⊗|triggered⟩⊗|activated⟩⊗|broken⟩⊗|dead⟩.
We prepare the entangled state Eq. (9.8). If repeated measurements of O always yield Eq. (9.8),
there is no collapse. So we can in principle verify the entangled state Eq. (9.8). However, we
can then in principle play the following trick. After verifying the entangled state, we check
whether the cat is alive or dead. If we ﬁnd it dead, i.e. in the state
|decayed⟩⊗|triggered⟩⊗|activated⟩⊗|broken⟩⊗|dead⟩,
we again measure the operator O. A measurement of O leaves the cat in an eigenstate of O.
The eigenstates of O are not orthogonal to the state in which the cat is alive, Eq. (9.7); so if we
now check again whether the cat is alive or dead, we may ﬁnd the cat alive. Hence if we can
measure O, we can revive a dead cat.
That is, we can in principle verify an entangled state in the same sense that we can in
principle reverse an irreversible process. Bohr took measurement to be an irreversible process
[9]. For example, if a radium nucleus decays and marks a blank photographic ﬁlm, that is an
irreversible process. Suppose a blank ﬁlm evolves by unitary evolution into a superposition of
a blank ﬁlm and a marked ﬁlm. Can we verify the superposition? If so, then we can also turn
marked ﬁlm into blank ﬁlm. Since we cannot in practice reverse this measurement, we cannot
in practice verify the superposition. This statement holds not only for Schr¨odinger’s cat and
for photographic ﬁlm, it holds for any measurement. If we cannot monitor the quantum phases
of a superposition of states of a measuring device, the measuring device is in practice classical,
as Bohr insisted, and the measurement is irreversible.
Today we can show, more explicitly than Bohr, why measurements are irreversible. Mea-
surements are irreversible because they involve pointers and other macroscopic objects that
4Even direct measurements of the quantum wave (described in Chap. 15) would not prove or disprove any of these
resolutions.

interact with the environment. Consider an entangled state of a measuring device and a mea-
sured system. The measuring device interacts with the environment and the relative phases of
the entangled state come to depend on the environment. We can minimize this interaction, but
we cannot eliminate it; consequently we lose track of the relative phases and cannot verify the
entangled state. This form of irreversibility is called decoherence. In practice, decoherence
happens so quickly that we cannot verify an entangled state of a measuring device and a mea-
sured system [10]. For all practical purposes, decoherence makes entanglement of a measuring
device and a measured system unobservable; but decoherence cannot select the actual result
of a measurement from the possible results.
If the paradox of Schr¨odinger’s cat never arises in practice, why modify quantum mechan-
ics? Perhaps some other theory accounts for the results of measurements. Perhaps boundary
conditions account for them. The Many Worlds interpretation assumes initial boundary con-
ditions on the universe (the initial state) but not ﬁnal boundary conditions. In Sects. 10.5 and
18.3 we consider ﬁnal boundary conditions as well. Can they account for the actual results of
measurements?

since the two wave packets ψT (x, t) and ψR(x, t) separate, their overlap – and thus their

suppressed.
∗9.5 In the “Many Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory, consider measurements of a
nondegenerate operator A, with eigenstates |a1⟩, . . . , |an⟩, on an ensemble of N systems
prepared in the identical state 
i ci|ai⟩. These measurements yield nN incompatible
accounts, each corresponding to a “world” with a certain measure. Within any world,
let Ni denote the number of systems left in the state |ai⟩by the measurement of A;
by deﬁnition 
i Ni = N. Consider the combined measure of all the worlds in which
Ni/N = |ci|2 to order 1/

measure approaches 1.
∗9.6 Consider an ensemble of identical systems in which the probability that a system is in

(The states |ψi⟩need not be orthogonal.) Prove the following:
(a) On the ensemble, the expectation value of any operator O is the trace of ρO, tr(ρO) =

i pi⟨ψi|O|ψi⟩.
(b) For every ρ, tr ρ = 1; but tr (ρ2) = 1 only if ρ = |ψi⟩⟨ψi| for some i.
(c) Suppose we measure O on one system in the ensemble. By the deﬁnition of an
ensemble, the density matrix of the other systems in the ensemble should remain ρ.
Show that if tr (ρ2) = 1 then the density matrix remains ρ, whether the number N of
systems in the ensemble is ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Show that the same is true if ρ represents
Alice’s systems when she and Bob share pairs of systems in an entangled state. (See
Sect. 3.4.) Show that if ρ is a mixture of N1 systems in the state |ψ1⟩, N2 systems in
the state |ψ2⟩, and so on, with Ni/N = pi for all i, then a measurement on one system
changes the density matrix of the other systems unless N is inﬁnite [11].

10 A Quantum Arrow of Time?
An arrow of time ﬂies through our experience. We remember the past but not the future. We
see balloons deﬂate – but never inﬂate – spontaneously; we scramble eggs and we cannot
unscramble scrambled eggs. Many physical processes are not reversible. But almost all ele-
mentary physical processes are reversible. Certain exotic processes1 involving the weak force
are not [1], but there is no known connection between the irreversibility of these microscopic
processes and the macroscopic irreversibility of our experience. So why is there an arrow of
time?
One explanation of macroscopic irreversibility follows from a common formulation of the
second law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a closed system never decreases over time
– disorder never decreases. (See Sect. 1.3.) A macroscopic process that increases entropy
is practically irreversible, and so irreversible macroscopic processes emerge from reversible
microscopic processes. However, this explanation does not satisfy us completely. At the very
least, it doesn’t account for the order we ﬁnd in the world. Without order, entropy could not
increase, and there would be no irreversible processes.
We can explain the order by assuming an ordered initial state of the universe. But why
assume an initial state? Why not assume a ﬁnal state? By imposing an initial but not a ﬁnal
boundary condition, we have already sent the arrow of time ﬂying. Suppose, instead, that we
impose an intermediate condition: physical laws are time symmetric, and we specify the state
of the universe at an intermediate time. If there is any uncertainty in the evolution of the state
– due either to indeterminism in physical laws or to an incomplete speciﬁcation of the state
– there is no arrow of time. Whether we run time forwards or backwards, entropy ultimately
increases. This argument (like the helium/neon paradox in Sect. 1.3) indicates that entropy
does not deﬁne the arrow of time – it follows the arrow of time.
Irreversibility is at the heart of the paradox of Schr¨odinger’s cat. (See Sect. 9.4.) Does
entropy account for this irreversibility? What, indeed, is irreversible in a quantum measure-
ment? Collapse is irreversible. Consider a quantum system S with orthonormal states |si⟩and
a measuring device D in the initial state |d0⟩. As in Sect. 9.3, we let |di⟩represent the state of
the measuring device when it indicates that S is in the state |si⟩. The evolution
|si, d0⟩→|si, di⟩,
for any i, deﬁnes the measurement. Now, if S is initially in a superposition 
i ci|si⟩, unitary
evolution takes S and D to an entangled state:

i
ci|si, d0⟩→

i
ci|si, di⟩.


i
ci|si, di⟩→|sj, dj⟩,
(10.2)
for some j with cj ̸= 0. The system and measuring device evolve to the state |sj, dj⟩. Suppose
now that S is initially in a different state 
i c′
i|si⟩, with c′
j ̸= 0. Assuming collapse, the system
and measuring device could evolve to the same ﬁnal state |sj, dj⟩:

i
c′
i|si, d0⟩→

i
c′
i|si, di⟩→|sj, dj⟩.
Since collapse can take two different initial states to the same ﬁnal state, collapse is irreversible.
If collapse is irreversible, what is the relation of collapse to thermodynamic irreversibil-
ity? Does Eq. (10.2) entail an increase in entropy? If there is no increase in entropy, does
quantum mechanics contain its own arrow of time? One way to approach these questions is to
consider possible boundary conditions on quantum processes. We have so far imposed only
an initial boundary condition on the measurement process. Why not impose a ﬁnal boundary
condition as well? This proposal may sound strange, but in practice, experiments often involve
successive measurements of noncommuting observables. For example, if we measure the spin
component of an atom successively along three distinct axes, the intermediate spin measure-
ment is sandwiched between initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions. Here classical and quantum
mechanics differ fundamentally. The initial state of a classical system determines its ﬁnal state
(via its equations of motion). But in quantum mechanics, the initial state of a system does not
determine its ﬁnal state, and we can impose almost any combination of initial and ﬁnal bound-
ary conditions. So before concluding that quantum mechanics contains an arrow of time, let’s
check whether our boundary conditions contain an arrow of time – whether initial boundary
conditions without ﬁnal boundary conditions make reversible processes look irreversible.
10.1
A Quantum Card Trick
In a typical (classical) card trick, a magician offers a deck of cards to a volunteer. The volunteer
picks a card at random, looks at it, and returns it at random to the deck, without showing it to
the magician. Then the magician (call her Madge) identiﬁes the card. How does she do it?
She may, for example, prepare the cards in a certain order, and then identify the volunteer’s
card as the one that is out of order. Thus the protocol of the card trick is as follows: First,
Madge prepares a state (the deck of cards). Second, the volunteer performs a measurement
(picks a card, looks at it and returns it) without informing Madge of the result. Finally, Madge
performs her own measurement (she gets back the deck and looks at it) and infers the result of
the volunteer’s measurement.
And now for a quantum card trick. A volunteer, please?
The protocol of the quantum card trick [2] is as follows: First, Madge prepares a state of a
spin-1/2 particle. Next, you (the volunteer) perform a measurement on the particle. You may
measure the spin component of the particle along the x-axis, the y-axis, or the z-axis – you
choose which axis. You don’t tell Madge which axis you chose, and you don’t tell her the

10.2

139
result of your measurement. Finally, Madge performs a measurement of her own, and hands
you a little list announcing the result of your measurement. Actually, the list announces three
results, one for each allowed measurement. For example, Madge may hand you the following
list:
If you measured σx, the result was 1.
If you measured σy, the result was −1.
If you measured σz, the result was −1.
⋆Have a nice day. ⋆
You may not believe it, but Madge is always right. Her list always includes the result of your
measurement. How does she do it?
According to the principle of complementarity, measurements of σx, σy and σz on a particle
at a given time are mutually exclusive. If Madge prepared the particle in an eigenstate of σx,
she could predict your result if you chose to measure σx. Moreover, don’t forget that Madge
makes a ﬁnal measurement, after yours. Suppose she measures σy. Then if you chose to
measure σx, she could identify your result from the state she prepared; if you chose to measure
σy, she could identify your result from her ﬁnal measurement. But how could she identify
your result if you chose to measure σz?
We leave this question as Prob. 10.1, with a hint: Madge could have an extra particle up
her sleeve. No, she is not allowed to swap the particles; it is not an identical particle. But the
initial state she prepares could be an entangled state of two particles.
10.2
Time Reversal
What is time reversal in quantum mechanics? Let’s try to answer the question via an analogy
with classical mechanics. Suppose x(t) represents the motion of a free classical particle, with
x(t) the particle position at time t. The time reverse of the motion is Tx(t) = x(−t). The
sequence of events is reversed in Tx(t): if in x(t) the particle moves from x(ta) to x(tb) in
time tb −ta, in Tx(t) the particle moves from x(tb) to x(ta) in the same time.
By analogy, the time reverse of an evolving quantum state ψ(x, t) should be ψ(x, −t).
But a simple example shows that this analogy cannot be correct: it would imply that the time
reverse of a free particle in a momentum eigenstate,
ψ(x, t) = eip·x/ℏ−ip2t/2m/ℏ,
is
ψ(x, −t) = eip·x/ℏ+ip2t/2m/ℏ;
but both ψ(x, t) and ψ(x, −t) represent a particle with momentum p, whereas time reversal
should reverse the momentum. Furthermore, ψ(x, t) is a solution to the Schr¨odinger equation
for a free particle,
iℏ∂
∂tψ(x, t) = p2
2mψ(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m∇2ψ(x, t) ,
but ψ(x, −t) is not, and both ψ(x, t) and Tψ(x, t) should be solutions to the Schr¨odinger
equation for a free particle, just as both x(t) and Tx(t) could be motions of a free classical

140
10
A Quantum Arrow of Time?
particle. The analogy fails because the classical and quantum descriptions of a free particle
are so different. All that x(t0) tells us is the position of the particle at time t0; the momentum
depends on dx(t)/dt evaluated at t = t0. By contrast, ψ(x, t0) yields both the position and
momentum distributions of a particle at a time t0.
The position distribution depends on ψ(x, t0) through the norm squared, and |ψ(x, t0)|2
resembles x(t0) in giving information only about the position distribution. For |Tψ(x, t)|2
to represent the time reverse of |ψ(x, t)|2, it must equal |ψ(x, −t)|2. Hence Tψ(x, t) and
ψ(x, −t) can differ only in phase, for every (x, t). What is the phase? Let us write ψ(x, t) as
a Fourier transform:
ψ(x, t) =
1
(2π)3/2
 ∞
−∞
d3p ˜ψ(p, t)eip·x/ℏ.
(10.3)
Taking the complex conjugate of Eq. (10.3), we see that the distribution of p in ψ(x, t) is
identical to the distribution of −p in ψ∗(x, t); that is, taking the complex conjugate of ψ(x, t)
reverses the direction of momentum, but leaves position unchanged. Thus, we may deﬁne the
time reversal operator T by
Tψ(x, t) = ψ∗(x, −t) .
(10.4)
While this operator T acts appropriately on x and p, we have not yet proved that T is the
correct time reversal operator. (See Prob. 10.2.) However, we obtain the same time reversal
operator T from the Schr¨odinger equation. Consider the Schr¨odinger equation for a single
charged particle:
iℏ∂
∂tψ(x, t) = H(t)ψ(x, t) ,
(10.5)
where the Hamiltonian H(t) depends explicitly on time:
H(t) =
1
2m [−iℏ∇−eA(x, t)]2 + V (x, t) .
Here A(x, t) is the electromagnetic vector potential and V (x, t) includes the electric scalar
potential. The state ψ(x, t) obeys Eq. (10.5) and evolves forward in time. Now assume that
the state Tψ(x, t), too, evolves forward in time, but represents the reverse sequence of events.
Then Tψ(x, t) must obey the Schr¨odinger equation, Eq. (10.5), with HT (t), the time reverse
of H(t), in the place of H(t). What is HT (t)? The time reverse of H(t) must contain −t
wherever H(t) contains t. In addition, it must contain −A instead of A, because the vector
potential A is a pseudovector. The sign of V , however, is unchanged under time reversal.2 We
obtain
HT (t) =
1
2m [−iℏ∇+ eA(x, −t)]2 + V (x, −t)
2The transformation of A and V follows from the transformation of E and B, since E = ∂A/∂t −∇V and
B = ∇× A. Electric ﬁelds are produced by charges and thus remain the same under time reversal. Magnetic ﬁelds
are produced by currents; since currents change sign under time reversal, so do magnetic ﬁelds. Thus E is a true
vector while B is a pseudovector, i.e. B changes sign under time reversal.

The Aharonov–Bergmann–Lebowitz Formula
141
and
iℏ∂
∂tTψ(x, t) = HT (t)Tψ(x, t) .
(10.6)
If we now replace t by −t everywhere in the original Schr¨odinger equation, Eq. (10.5), and
also take the complex conjugate of both sides, we ﬁnd
iℏ∂
∂tψ∗(x, −t) =
1
2m [iℏ∇−eA(x, −t)]2 ψ∗(x, −t) + V (x, −t)ψ∗(x, −t)
= HT (t)ψ∗(x, −t) .
(10.7)
Comparing Eqs. (10.6–7), we ﬁnd Tψ(x, t) = ψ∗(x, −t), as above in Eq. (10.4).
Wigner, who ﬁrst derived T, proved that T is an antilinear operator [3]. That is, if ψ(x, t) =
α1ψ1(x, t) + α2ψ2(x, t), then
T [α1ψ1(x, t) + α2ψ2(x, t)] = Tψ(x, t)
= ψ∗(x, −t)
= α∗

1(x, −t) + α∗
2ψ∗
2(x, −t)
= α∗
1Tψ1(x, t) + α∗
2Tψ2(x, t) .
But the proof that T is antilinear does not require assuming Tψ(x, t) = ψ∗(x, −t). (See
Prob. 10.4.) The deﬁnition of T in Eq. (10.4) is not always correct. Note that we can multiply
T by an arbitrary phase factor to get an equivalent time reversal operator. In Eq. (10.4) we
have set this phase factor to 1. However, we cannot always do so when T acts on states with
spin. (See Sect. 11.2.)
10.3
The Aharonov–Bergmann–Lebowitz Formula
We know how to compute the probability of an outcome, given an initial boundary condition.
Let the initial state at time ta be |a⟩; let U(t, ta) be the operator that evolves the state |a⟩forward
in time from ta to t. If at time t we measure a nondegenerate operator C having eigenvalues
and eigenvectors cj and |cj⟩, respectively, then P(cj/a), the conditional probability of the
result cj, is |⟨cj|U(t, ta)|a⟩|2. However, our discussion of collapse and reversibility suggests
that we need a formula for computing the probability of an outcome, given both initial and
ﬁnal boundary conditions. So does the quantum card trick.
Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebowitz derived such a formula [4]:
P(cj/a, b) =
|⟨b|U(tb, t)|cj⟩⟨cj|U(t, ta)|a⟩|2

i |⟨b|U(tb, t)|ci⟩⟨ci|U(t, ta)|a⟩|2 .
(10.8)
Here |b⟩is the ﬁnal boundary condition at time tb; U(tb, t) is the operator that evolves a
state from t to time tb; and P(cj/a, b) is the probability that a measurement of C at time t
yields cj, given the boundary conditions |a⟩at time ta and |b⟩at time tb. The numerator of the
Aharonov–Bergmann–Lebowitz (ABL) formula is the product of two conditional probabilities,
the probability P(cj/a) that a measurement of C at time t yields cj, given that the state at time
ta is |a⟩, and the probability P(b/cj) that the state at time tb is |b⟩, given that a measurement

142
10
A Quantum Arrow of Time?
of C at time t yields cj. To normalize the numerator, we divide it by the total probability

j P(b, cj)P(cj, a) that the state at time tb is |b⟩, given that the state at time ta is |a⟩, and
assuming a measurement of C at time t. This total probability is the denominator of Eq. (10.8).
The ABL formula allows us to compute the probabilities of results of any measurement between
initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions. For example, if |a⟩is an eigenstate of σx with eigenvalue
1, and |b⟩is an eigenstate of σy with eigenvalue −1, Eq. (10.8) shows that a measurement of
σx at time t must yield 1, and a measurement of σy at time t must yield −1. A measurement
of σz at time t is equally likely to yield 1 and −1.
Is the ABL formula invariant under time reversal? To answer this question, let us start with
a Hamiltonian that is invariant under time reversal:
H = p2/2m + V (x) .
The amplitude for a state |a⟩to evolve to a state |b⟩in a time tb −ta is equal to
⟨b|U(tb −ta)|a⟩,
while the amplitude for the time-reversed process – for the state |b⟩∗to evolve to the state |a⟩∗
in a time tb −ta, with the same Hamiltonian – equals
(⟨a|∗)U(tb −ta)(|b⟩∗) = (⟨a|U ∗(tb −ta)|b⟩)∗
= (⟨a|U ∗(tb −ta)|b⟩)†
= ⟨b|U ∗(ta −tb)|a⟩.
Now U(tb −ta) = e−iH(tb−ta)/ℏ, so U ∗(ta −tb) = eiH∗(ta−tb)/ℏ= U(tb −ta) since H is
real. Hence the amplitudes are the same. In general, the ABL formula is invariant under time
reversal if the relevant Hamiltonian is. (See Prob. 10.5.)
TheABLformuladoesnotlooktimereversalinvariant, onlybecausetheevolutionoperators
U(tb, t) and U(t, ta) indicate the arrow of time. However, we can rewrite Eq. (10.8) to make
it look time reversal invariant. From Eq. (5.14), we have
U †(tj, ti) = U(ti, tj) ,
Then Eq. (10.8) becomes
P(cj) =
|⟨b|U †(t, tb)|cj⟩⟨cj|U(t, ta)|a⟩|2

i |⟨b|U †(t, tb)|ci⟩⟨ci|U(t, ta)|a⟩|2 .
(10.9)
Since ⟨b|U †(t, tb) = [U(t, tb)|b⟩]† we can regard U †(t, tb) in Eq. (10.10) as evolving ⟨b|
backwards in time from tb to t. Then the time evolution operators in Eq. (10.10) evolve the
ﬁnal state ⟨b| backward and the initial state |a⟩forward to the same intermediate time t, and
no explicit arrow of time appears in Eq. (10.10). Actually, Eq. (10.8) can always be rewritten
as Eq. (10.10), whether or not the relevant Hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal. What
makes the ABL formula time reversal invariant (or not) is the Hamiltonian, and not the form of
Eq. (10.8) or Eq. (10.10). However, Eq. (10.10) is convenient for problems with given initial
and ﬁnal boundary conditions, for it is simpler to evolve a ﬁnal state ⟨b| backwards in time
than to evolve several intermediate states |ci⟩forwards in time.

10.4
The Arrow of Time Revisited
143
Equation (10.8) and Eq. (10.10) assume one intermediate measurement, but there may
be many such measurements.
Let us consider a series of n intermediate measurements,
at times t1, t2, . . . , tn, of nondegenerate operators C(1), C(2), . . . , C(n), with eigenvalues
c(1)
i1 , c(2)
i2 , , . . . , c(n)
in
respectively.
(For degenerate operators, see Prob.
10.6.)
We obtain
the conditional probability P(c(1)
j1 , c(2)
j2 , . . . , c(n)
jn /a, b) to ﬁnd the values c(1)
j1 , c(2)
j2 , . . . , c(n)
jn ,
respectively, for these operators:
P(c(1)
j1 , c(2)
j2 , . . . , c(n)
jn /a, b)
(10.10)
=
|⟨b|U(tb, tn)|c(n)

in ⟩. . . ⟨c(2)
i2 |U(t2, t1)|c(1)
i1 ⟩⟨c(1)
i1 |U(t1, ta)|a⟩|2 .
This expression is invariant under time reversal if the relevant Hamiltonian is. What about col-
lapse in the ABL formula? Collapse appears explicitly in Eq. (10.11) at arbitrarily many times
t1, t2, . . . , tn, since Eq. (10.11) is the conditional probability – not the probability amplitude
– of the intermediate results c(1)
j1 , c(2)
j2 , . . . , c(n)
jn . Hence, given both initial and ﬁnal boundary
conditions, collapse does not imply irreversibility; there is no “quantum arrow of time”.
10.4
The Arrow of Time Revisited
The ABL formula, Eq. (10.8), assumes a ﬁnal boundary condition, but how do we impose
ﬁnal boundary conditions? Final boundary conditions are no different from initial boundary
conditions. We impose either initial or ﬁnal boundary conditions by selecting for them. For
example, to prepare an ensemble of particles with the initial boundary condition Sx = ℏ/2, we
take a larger ensemble of the particles, measure Sx on each, and select particles with Sx = ℏ/2.
If initial conditions alone deﬁne the ensemble, it is a preselected ensemble. To impose the ﬁnal
boundary condition Sy = −ℏ/2, we measure Sy on each particle – at the end of the experiment
– and select only those with Sy = −ℏ/2. Together, initial and ﬁnal conditions deﬁne a pre-
and postselected ensemble. Pre- and postselected (PPS) ensembles often turn up in sequences
of laboratory measurements.
The ABL formula applied to pre- and postselected ensembles (with Hamiltonians that are
invariant under time reversal) provides a formulation of quantum mechanics that has no “arrow
of time”: all quantum processes are reversible. Is this formulation of quantum mechanics
equivalent to the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics? We can (and did) derive
this formulation from the conventional formulation; can we derive the conventional formulation
fromit? Thatis, canwederivetheprobabilityofaresult, giveninitialboundaryconditionsalone
(as in the conventional formulation)? At ﬁrst it seems we cannot, because (by construction)
the ABL formula yields the probability of a result given initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions.
However, we will now discover how to compute both kinds of probability.
To simplify, we drop all the time evolution operators in Eq. (10.11), i.e. we set them all to 1.
(There is no loss of generality in doing so, since we can absorb them into the deﬁnitions of the
states |a⟩, |c(1)j1⟩, . . . , |b⟩.) Now let C and C′ be two noncommuting observables, and suppose
a measurement of C yields the result cj. What is the probability a measurement of C′ will
now yield the result c′
k? According to the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics, the

144

probability is P(c′
k/cj) = |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2. To obtain P(c′
k/cj) = |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2 from the ABL formula,
we assume that C and C′ are two successive intermediate measurements in Eq. (10.11), i.e.
c′
k and cj correspond to c(m)
k
and c(m−1)
j
for some m. We begin by applying Eq. (10.11) to
calculate P(c′
k/a, cj, b). Here P(c′
k/a, cj, b) is the probability that a measurement of C′ yields
c′
k, given that the initial state is |a⟩, the ﬁnal state is |b⟩, and that a measurement of C just prior
to the measurement of C′ yields cj. (The intermediate measurements C(1), . . . , C(m−2) and
C(m+2), . . . , C(n) are also given, although they are not explicit in the notation P(c′
k/a, cj, b).)
We apply Eq. (10.11) as follows: In the denominator, we sum over intermediate measurements
of all operators except C alone. In the numerator, we sum over intermediate measurements
of all operators except C and C′. We ﬁnd that Eq. (10.11) no longer depends on any of the
measurements that preceded C. We have
P(c′
k/a, cj, b) =

jm+1,jm+2,...,jn |⟨b|c(n)
jn ⟩. . . ⟨c(m+1)
jm+1 |c′

k⟩|2

im,im+1,...,in |⟨b|c(n)
in ⟩. . . ⟨c(m)
im |cj⟩|2
.
(10.11)
P(c′
k/a, cj, b) does not depend on any measurements prior to the measurement of C, but still
depends on the measurements that follow C′. We might guess, however, that if the subsequent
observables are sufﬁciently different from one another, they will tend to screen the inﬂuence
of the ﬁnal boundary condition; then the ratio of sums will not depend on the following
measurements, and P(c′
k/a, cj, b) will reduce to |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2, as in the conventional formulation.
Actually, our guess turns out to be correct, if we choose at least two of the observables
correctly. Consider a sum that is part of both the numerator and the denominator of Eq. (10.12):

jn−1,jn
|c(n−1)
jn−1 ⟩⟨c(n−1)
jn−1 |c(n)
jn ⟩⟨c(n)
jn |b⟩⟨b|c(n)
jn ⟩⟨c(n)
jn |c(n−1)
jn−1 ⟩⟨c(n−1)
jn−1 | .
(10.12)
If the states |c(n−1)
jn−1 ⟩and |c(n)
jn ⟩satisfy the condition that for all jn−1 and jn,
|⟨c(n)
jn |c(n−1)
jn−1 ⟩|2 = constant ,
then the sum in Eq. (10.13) is a multiple of the identity matrix. (See Prob. 10.8.) Then the
numerator and denominator of Eq. (10.12) both reduce to 1, and we obtain P(c′
k/a, cj, b) =
|⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2.
We can therefore obtain the conventional formula from the ABL formula by including suit-
able measurements in the sequence of measurements preceding the ﬁnal boundary condition.
If so, do we conclude that the ABL formula implies the conventional formulation? No, for if
we can screen the effects of the ﬁnal boundary conditions, we can also screen the effects of
the initial boundary conditions. We obtained the result that if a measurement of C yields cj,
the subsequent measurement of C′ will yield c′
k with probability |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2. This statement is
a prediction. But the ABL formula has no arrow of time; we can just as well obtain from it the
result that if a measurement of C′ yields c′
k, the prior measurement of C yielded cj with the
same probability |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2. This statement is a retrodiction. In our experience, the prediction

10.5
Boundary Conditions on the Universe
145
is true but the retrodiction is false. Suppose, for example, we localize a photon in space. The
subsequent momentum of the photon is uncertain, so we cannot say in what direction the photon
will propagate; all directions are equally likely. But what about the direction of the photon’s
motion before the position measurement? Were all directions equally likely? No, the photon
arrived from a lamp, a star, or from some other source of photons. This source of asymmetry
in the direction of time is thermodynamic and cosmological; thermodynamics prescribes that
physical systems that are not in thermal equilibrium tend towards equilibrium. If macroscopic
physics did not provide this irreversibility, quantum mechanics could not itself generate it.
To conclude, the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics reﬂects the fact that
predictions (as described above) are valid, while retrodictions are not. The ABL formula does
not account for this fact and therefore does not imply the conventional formulation. By adding
to the ABL formula the postulate that P(c′
k/a, cj, b) = |⟨c′
k|cj⟩|2 is valid for predictions, but
not retrodictions, we do obtain the conventional formulation, which therefore contains an arrow
of time. The ABL formula, however, suggests that this arrow of time is not a quantum arrow
of time; its origin is macroscopic rather than microscopic.
10.5
Boundary Conditions on the Universe
According to the ABL formula, Eq. (10.8), all quantum processes are reversible if the rele-
vant Hamiltonian is reversible. Irreversibility is due to boundary conditions. What boundary
questions? Are they symmetric under time reversal?
Cocke, Schulman, and Hartle and Gell-Mann [5] have considered boundary conditions on
the universe that are symmetric in time. For example, let us consider a toy model universe
consisting of a box ﬁlled with a nearly ideal gas. In the equilibrium state, the gas ﬁlls the
box at constant density. But the initial state, at time t = 0, is far from equilibrium: all the
molecules in the gas occupy one corner of the box, and are completely absent from the rest of
the box. In the subsequent evolution, according to statistical mechanics, the gas approaches
the equilibrium state. However, suppose we impose a ﬁnal boundary condition at time t = 2T:
we restrict the possible evolutions to those which lead, after a time 2T, to a ﬁnal state identical
to the initial state. What is the evolution in this model?
With overwhelming probability the gas, with all the molecules initially in one corner, will
diffuse more and more evenly throughout the box. After a time not less than T, however, we
will see a strange phenomenon: the gas will begin to collect into the same corner of the box
where it originally clustered, until ﬁnally at time 2T the gas is back in its initial state. We can
distinguish three types of evolution, depending on T and the relaxation time. Let T0 be the
relaxation time of the initial state of the gas in the box; that is, without any special constraints
on the ﬁnal state, the gas would evolve from its initial conﬁguration to equilibrium in a time
T0. For T < T0, the gas will not reach equilibrium before it starts its reverse evolution towards
the ﬁnal state. For T = T0, the gas will reach equilibrium but not remain there, whereas
for T > T0 the gas will reach equilibrium and remain there for a time 2(T −T0) before
evolving towards the ﬁnal state. In each case, since the initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions
are identical, the evolution is invariant under time reversal. The three cases are depicted in
Fig. 10.1, which shows results of a simulation of a ﬁnite number of particles and intermediate
states. Figure 10.1 reveals an important difference between the two cases T < T0 and T ≥T0.

Figure 10.1: Simulations of a version of the Ehrenfest urn model, with four distinct balls distributed
between two urns. At each time step either one ball or no ball (with equal probability) may jump from one
urn to the other. The number of balls in each urn deﬁnes the macrostate, and the entropy of the macrostate
is the logarithm of the number of arrangements of balls consistent with that macrostate. In the initial
state, all the balls are in the same urn, and the ﬁnal state is identical to the initial state. The graph shows
entropy S divided by maximum entropy Smax as a function of time, averaged over many evolutions, for
2T ranging from 4 to 20 steps. The averages over many evolutions manifest time symmetry although
individual evolutions do not. The relaxation time T0 is approximately 8 steps. For 2T = 4 to 12 steps
(T < T0), the evolution never reaches equilibrium (maximum entropy), while for 2T = 18 to 20 steps
(T > T0), the evolution stays at equilibrium for a time and the ﬁnal boundary condition is not evident in
the evolution to equilibrium.
If T is less than T0, the ﬁrst half of the evolution is different from the evolution with no ﬁnal
boundary condition. If T ≥T0, however, the ﬁrst half of the evolution is indistinguishable
from evolution with no ﬁnal boundary condition. Only in the case T ≤T0 could we detect,
before the time T, evolution towards a ﬁnal boundary condition.
Our discussion of ﬁnal boundary conditions on the universe continues in Sect. 18.3, but
without the assumption of time symmetry between initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions. This
assumption seems unwarranted. As far as we know, the universe initially had minimal entropy,
and entropy has been increasing ever since. This increase in entropy is consistent with quantum
mechanics. Under unitary time evolution, pure states remain pure states; but product states
do not generally remain product states. Even if the state of the universe was initially a pure
product state, and evolved according to unitary time evolution, it is today highly entangled;
subsystems that once interacted locally have since separated to great distances. Locally, the
state of each subsystem is not a pure state, but a mixture, and has entropy. Thus quantum
mechanics offers an objective account of entropy increase, unrelated to “coarse graining”:
quantum entropy measures the entanglement of systems [6].
In particular, measurements
leave measuring devices and measured systems entangled. On the one hand, systems that
have interacted separate, increasing local entropy. On the other hand, unitary time evolution
insures that no measurement result ever disappears without a trace. Measured values, carefully

11 Superselection Rules
Our claim, throughout Chaps. 7–10, is that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics corresponds
completely with experiment: not only does the theory correctly predict the results of exper-
iments, it predicts just the results of possible experiments, neither more nor less. But many
physicists claim the contrary. Wick, Wightman and Wigner claimed, in 1952, that some Her-
mitian operators of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can never be measured; thus theory
and experiment do not correspond completely [1]. They introduced the term superselection
rule; each superselection rule asserts that some Hermitian operator of quantum theory is not
an observable. Such a rule would invalidate our treatment of quantum measurements, because
we assume (following von Neumann) that any Hermitian operator is measurable. Since the
treatment of quantum measurements is central to this book, we must show that there are no
superselection rules in nonrelativistic quantum theory. (But in relativistic quantum theory,
there certainly are superselection rules; see Prob. 11.1 and Chap. 14.)

Additional properties of T appear in Sect. 11.2, and Sect. 11.3 presents the Wick–Wightman–
Wigner argument. But ﬁrst, Sect 11.1 presents a paradox concerning a measurement of angular
momentum. According to this paradox, angular momentum is not measurable. Yet there is no
superselection rule for angular momentum! After resolving this paradox, in Sect. 11.4, we can
resolve the argument about superselection rules.
11.1
Superselection Rule for Angular Momentum?
Imagine a closed, free-ﬂoating and isolated laboratory, with a Stern-Gerlach apparatus rigidly
mounted in it. The laboratory contains an isolated atom and we would like to measure the spin
component of the atom along the z-axis of Fig. 11.1. We measure Sz with the Stern-Gerlach
apparatus: the atom enters the apparatus perpendicular to the ﬁeld gradient, and if it deﬂects
up, we say Sz is positive; if the atom deﬂects down, we say Sz is negative. Although this
is the standard way to measure the spin component of an atom, someone might criticize our
measurement as follows:
You cannot possibly measure the spin component of the atom. You and your labora-
tory and everything in it, including the atom, do not interact with anything else in the
universe during the experiment. Thus, the total angular momentum of the laboratory
and its contents is a conserved quantity. In particular, the total angular momentum
along the x-axis is a conserved quantity throughout the experiment. Now, the total

angular momentum along the x-axis is
Jx = Sx + Lx + Jlab
x
,
where Sx is the x-component of the spin of the atom, Lx is the x-component of
the orbital angular momentum of the atom and Jlab
x
is the angular momentum of
everything else in the laboratory. Clearly Sz, the z-component of the spin of the
atom, does not commute with Jx, because it does not commute with Sx. So you
could not have measured it!
We might not accept this argument but there is something reasonable in it. According to
von Neumann, we can measure Sz with an interaction Hamiltonian of the form
Hint = g(t)SzPd ,
where Pd is conjugate to a “pointer” displacement Qd that shows the result of the measurement.
(See Sect. 7.2.) The total Hamiltonian H is then
H = Hint + Hatom + Hlab ,
where Hint = g(t)SzPd applies to the measurement, Hatom applies to the atom and Hlab
applies to everything else in the laboratory. Now H and Jx do not commute, because [H, Jx]
contains the term [Hint, Sx] = iℏg(t)SyPd and nothing else in [H, Jx] can cancel this term.
If H contains Hint, then Sx is uncertain and so Jx is conserved only approximately. But Jx
is exactly conserved!
This paradox is not limited to angular momentum. If von Neumann’s approach is wrong
for this measurement, it is wrong for many other measurements, as well. Any measurement
interaction that does not commute with each additive conserved quantity of the total system
(the measured system and measuring device) will lead to a paradox. For example, suppose we
want to measure the position of a particle in one space dimension. Let x denote the position
of the particle and p its momentum, and let P denote the momentum of the measuring device.

11.2
T and Spin
151
If the particle and measuring device are free and isolated, apart from their mutual interaction,
then the total momentum p+P is a conserved quantity. But x does not commute with the total
momentum:
[p + P, x] = [p, x] = −iℏ.
Apparently, either we cannot measure the position of the particle, or else p + P cannot be
a conserved quantity. A measurement of x makes p uncertain, and then there is no sense in
saying that p + P does not change during the measurement.
11.2
T and Spin
The argument of Wick, Wightman and Wigner involves the time reversal operator T acting on
quantum spin states. Section 10.2 introduces T as an antilinear operator, and Eq. (10.4) deﬁnes
its action:
Tψ(x, t) = ψ∗(x, −t) .
However, Eq. (10.4) does not deﬁne the action of T on states with spin. What does time reversal
do to spin?
Spin is a form of angular momentum, so we can infer the action of T on spin states from
its action on orbital angular momentum states [2]. Time reversal makes a spinning object spin
in the opposite sense, with the same angular speed. So the time reverse of a state of angular
momentum mℏalong the z-axis, for example, should be a state with angular momentum −mℏ
along the z-axis. Is it? Eigenstates of Lz, the z-component of orbital angular momentum, are
proportional to eimφ, where φ is the azimuthal angle about the z-axis and mℏis the angular
momentum. According to Eq. (10.4), T sends eimφ to e−imφ, so indeed T replaces mℏwith
−mℏ. Writing the eigenstates of Lz as kets |m⟩, we have
T|m⟩= | −m⟩.
(11.1)
Here, as in Eq. (10.4), T could include an arbitrary overall phase factor. We have set it to 1 for
convenience.
We soon discover, however, that we cannot always set the phase to 1. Consider a spin-1/2
particle. The eigenvalues of Sz = ℏσz/2 are ℏ/2 and −ℏ/2. The corresponding eigenstates
are |1/2⟩and | −1/2⟩in the notation of Eq. (11.1), or | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩in our usual notation.
Applied to | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩, Eq. (11.1) yields
T| ↑⟩= | ↓⟩,
T| ↓⟩= | ↑⟩.
(11.2)
But Eq. (11.2) implies that
T 1

2 is an eigenstate of Sx with eigenvalue ℏ/2; according to Eq. (11.3),
T does nothing to Sx. But T must reverse the direction of Sx just as it reverses the direction

152

Superselection Rules
of Sz. Thus Eq. (11.1) cannot deﬁne the action of T correctly. Note that it does not help to
include in T a phase factor that is the same for all spin states; T cannot reverse the direction
of Sx unless it multiplies | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩by different phases.
Once we realize that T must include a phase that depends on the spin state, it is not hard
to discover the action of T. We write
T| ↑⟩= eiα↑| ↓⟩,
T| ↓⟩= eiα↓| ↑⟩.
(11.4)
Then T reverses the direction of Sx if and only if
ei(α↑−α↓) = −1 .
(11.5)
If T satisﬁes Eq. (11.5), and if T is an antilinear operator, then it also reverses the direction of
Sy. Indeed, T reverses the spin of any spin-1/2 state. (See Prob. 11.2.)
Now comes a little surprise. Suppose we act on the state | ↑⟩twice with T. We ﬁnd
T 2| ↑⟩= Teiα↑| ↓⟩
= e−iα↑T| ↓⟩
= e−iα↑eiα↓| ↑⟩
= −| ↑⟩,
(11.6)
applying Eq. (11.5). Acting on the state, T 2 reverses the direction of time and then reverses it
again – so it should leave the state unchanged. We might have expected T 2 = 1, but actually
T 2 could equal any phase factor, since an overall phase does not change a physical state. (See
also Prob. 10.3.) What matters is that T 2 should equal the same phase factor for all physical
states – otherwise T 2 would change some superpositions of states. Computing T 2| ↓⟩as in
Eq. (11.6), we ﬁnd that T 2| ↓⟩= −| ↓⟩; hence T 2 = −1 for all spin-1/2 states, and two time
reversals leave any state unchanged.
And now comes a big surprise. For states |m⟩with Sz = mℏ, where m is an integer,
we assumed Eq. (11.1). But since T may include an m-dependent phase, we must modify
Eq. (11.1):
T|m⟩= eiαm| −m⟩.
In particular, T|0⟩= eiα0|0⟩. If we ask how T 2 acts on |0⟩, we ﬁnd T 2|0⟩= T(eiα0|0⟩) =
e−iα0T|0⟩= |0⟩. So T 2 = 1 here! Of course if T 2|0⟩= |0⟩, we must have T 2|m⟩= |m⟩for
all m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , otherwise T 2 would change some linear combinations of these states.
We can insure T 2 = 1 for all the |m⟩with integer m by assuming eiα−m = eiαm for all integer
m. However, we cannot deﬁne T 2 so that it acts uniformly on all spin states, both when m is
an integer and when it is not; T 2 does not act uniformly even on |0⟩and | ↑⟩.

2 are physically distinct. But according to the Wick–Wightman–Wigner argu-
ment, they are not. If |Ψ+⟩and |Ψ−⟩are not physically distinct, then any operator connecting
|0⟩and | ↑⟩must be unmeasurable. For example, deﬁne an operator A:
A = |0⟩⟨↑| + | ↑⟩⟨0| .
(11.7)
The expectation values of A in the states |Ψ+⟩and |Ψ−⟩are not the same. Indeed, |Ψ+⟩and
|Ψ−⟩are eigenstates of A with eigenvalues 1 and -1, respectively. If A is measurable, then
|Ψ+⟩and |Ψ−⟩are physically distinct. Thus A must be unmeasurable, and a relative phase
between |0⟩and | ↑⟩has no physical meaning.
We have seen that T 2 = 1 for any state |m⟩with integer m, while T 2 = −1 for any
state |m⟩with m = ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2, . . . .
We refer to states with T 2 = 1 as boson
states, and states with T 2 = −1 as fermion states, in accordance with the spin-statistics
theorem [3]. (This theorem shows an intimate connection among rotation, time reversal and
interchange of particles in quantum theory.) Thus T 2 = 1 for bosons and T 2 = −1 for
fermions. According to Wick, Wightman and Wigner, any operator connecting boson and
fermion states is unmeasurable.
There is another argument in favor of this superselection rule. A rotation of 2π leaves
boson states unchanged, but gives fermion states a phase of -1. We can obtain the phase from
the operator for rotations. Let a unit vector n deﬁne the direction of an axis passing through
a particle, and let S be the spin operator for the particle. The operator e−iS·nθ/ℏrotates the
state of the particle an angle θ about the axis. Since the eigenvalues of S · n are mℏ, where
m = ±1/2, ±3/2, . . . for fermions and m is an integer for bosons, a rotation of 2π gives
any fermion state a phase of −1 but leaves boson states unchanged. Suppose we prepare the
state |Ψ+⟩. It is an eigenstate of the operator A deﬁned in Eq. (11.7), and A|Ψ+⟩= |Ψ+⟩. A
2π rotation transforms |Ψ+⟩into |Ψ−⟩, and A|Ψ−⟩= −|Ψ−⟩. Wick, Wightman and Wigner
claimed that A is unmeasurable since a rotation through 2π should not change the value of any
observable.
11.4
Everything is Relative
The paradoxes of Sect. 11.1 force us to think about what we actually measure. One paradox
states that if the total momentum of a particle and a measuring device, p + P, is a conserved
quantity, then we cannot measure x, the position of the particle, because it does not commute
with the total momentum. But what is x? The absolute position of the particle? We cannot

154

Superselection Rules
measure the absolute position of the particle any more than we can measure the absolute position
of the universe. What we actually measure is the position of the particle relative to the position
X of the measuring device, i.e. we measure x −X; the relative position does commute with
the total momentum p + P,
[p + P, x −X] = 0 ,
so we can measure position despite conservation of momentum.
The solution of the paradox of angular momentum is just as simple. We cannot measure
absolute quantities. Do we really measure Sz? What deﬁnes the z-axis? We measure the
component of angular momentum of the particle along an axis attached to the laboratory, not
along an axis external to the laboratory. The Stern-Gerlach device measures S·ez, where ez is
a unit vector along the axis of magnet in the device. (See Fig. 11.2.) The question is whether
S · ez, the angular momentum component along the axis of the magnet, commutes with Jx.
To see that it does, we deﬁne ez with respect to an external frame, in spherical coordinates:
ez = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) .
In the same spherical coordinates, Lx is
Lx = iℏ
	
sin φ ∂
∂θ + cot θ cos φ ∂
∂φ

,
and we require
0 = [Jx , S · ez] =

Lx + ℏ
2σx , ℏ
2σ · ez

.
(11.8)
It is straightforward to check that Eq. (11.8) holds. The lesson is that all measurements refer
to relative quantities. Even the time in a coupling g(t) is relative time; to be explicit, we can
write t −td instead of t, where td is a reference time.
If we now return to the Wick, Wightman and Wigner argument for a boson-fermion su-
perselection rule, we ﬁnd it resembles these paradoxes. A rotation of 2π introduces a relative
phase of -1 between boson and fermion states; thus it takes a state such as (|0⟩+| ↑⟩)/
√
2 to an
orthogonal state. Yet a 2π rotation should leave physical states unchanged. Now we stop and
ask: a 2π rotation with respect to what? On the one hand, a 2π rotation of the whole universe
leaves physical states unchanged. Indeed, a rotation of the universe through any angle leaves
physical states unchanged, because there is no meaning to rotation unless it is rotation with
respect to something that does not rotate. On the other hand, a relative rotation through 2π
could in principle change physical states. True, in classical physics a relative rotation through
2π does not change any physical state, but quantum physics is not classical physics.1 Thus,
we claim that the argument for a boson-fermion superselection rule confuses absolute and
relative. The rule only forbids measuring operators that we anyway cannot measure, because
they represent absolute quantities.
1Even in classical physics, a 2π rotation of one object with respect to another can change their physical state, if the
two objects are linked. For example, ﬁx one end of a long ribbon and hold the free end near the ﬁxed end. A complete
rotation of the free end twists the ribbon. But another complete rotation removes the twist: just loop the middle of the
ribbon around the free end.

Figure 11.2: The Stern-Gerlach measurement as in Fig. 11.1
showing the axes of the spin and of the magnet.
We can see the effect of a relative 2π rotation in a thought experiment on a neutron [4].
Consider two identical boxes, with a constant magnetic ﬁeld inside each. (See Fig. 11.3.) The
magnetic ﬁelds are equally strong, and initially parallel. We will call one box the “nonrotating”
(NR) box and the other the “rotating” (R) box; the latter is free to rotate around an axis
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. We can also separate the boxes or bring
them into contact; when they are in contact, we can open a small window in their common side.
Suppose that when the boxes are apart, the neutron Hamiltonian is H0 and the neutron ground
states |NR⟩and |R⟩have the same energy E, i.e. H0 is degenerate; but when the two boxes
are in contact with the window open, a small interaction term Hint allows the neutron to pass
from one box to the other and breaks the degeneracy. Then in addition to H0|NR⟩= E|NR⟩
and H0|R⟩= E|R⟩when the boxes are apart, we have Hint|R⟩= −ϵ|NR⟩and Hint|NR⟩=
−ϵ|R⟩when the boxes are in contact and the window open. The eigenstates of H0 + Hint are
not |NR⟩and |R⟩but rather the superpositions

which equals (|+⟩+ |−⟩)/

,
and the probability to ﬁnd the neutron in the state |NR⟩at time t is [1 + cos(2ϵt/ℏ)]/2 =
cos2(ϵt/ℏ). That is, the neutron is certainly in the state |NR⟩at times t = nh/2ϵ and certainly
in the state |R⟩at times t = nh/2ϵ + h/4ϵ. The tunnelling current is
d
dt cos2(ϵt/ℏ) = −ϵ
ℏsin(2ϵt/ℏ) ,
and its magnitude is maximal at times t = nh/2ϵ ± h/8ϵ, changing direction every h/4ϵ.
So far we have not rotated the “rotating” box. To demonstrate the effect of a relative 2π
rotation, we wait until the tunnelling into the state |R⟩is maximal, e.g. until time t = h/8ϵ,
then close the window and separate the boxes. Assume that we cut off the interaction instantly,
so the tunnelling stops just when the neutron is equally likely to be in either box. We now
effect a slow 2π rotation of the rotating box. During the rotation, the Hamiltonian for the state
|R⟩is
HR(t) = e−i(L+S)·nωt/ℏH0ei(L+S)·nωt/ℏ,
(11.10)
where L is the angular momentum of the neutron, S is its spin, n is a unit vector along the axis
of rotation, and ω is the angular frequency of rotation. The instantaneous ground state of HR
is
e−i(L+S)·nωt/ℏ|R⟩,
(11.11)
and a 2π rotation (which lasts a time t = 2π/ω) turns the state |R⟩into −|R⟩, since the
eigenvalues of L · n/ℏare integers and the eigenvalues of S · n/ℏare ±1/2. Only the state
|R⟩changes sign; thus the relative phase between |NR⟩and |R⟩changes by π. In addition,
there is a contribution to the relative phase due to the different energies of the neutron in the
two boxes (when one box is rotating). However, this contribution vanishes in the limit ω →0.
Since we can make the rotation arbitrarily slow, we neglect this contribution.
Wick, Wigner and Wightman did not consider rotating |R⟩relative to |NR⟩. The rotation
sends |+⟩to |−⟩and vice versa. If we now bring the boxes into contact and open the window,
we will ﬁnd that the tunnelling into the state |NR⟩(and not |R⟩) is maximal, because we have
reversed the relative phase between |+⟩and |−⟩. This change in the tunnelling current would
(in principle) be observable.
Hence a relative 2π rotation yields an observable phase. We can express either |NR⟩or |R⟩
as a superposition of a fermion and a boson – a fermion if the neutron is in the corresponding
box, a boson if it is not. (See Prob. 11.6.) A 2π rotation changes the relative phase of the
fermion and boson; but to observe this phase we must rotate one box relative to the other box. A
relative double time reversal would produce the same observable phase, except that we cannot
effect a relative double time reversal as we can effect a relative 2π rotation.

Superposing Charge States

11.5
Superposing Charge States
Wick, Wightman and Wigner also proposed a superselection rule for charge. A charge super-
selection rule asserts that, in a superposition of states |n⟩of different charges,

n
cn|n⟩,
(11.12)
only the absolute values of the coefﬁcients cn, and not their phases, are measurable. The
argument for this rule draws on quantum ﬁeld theory. The terms appearing in a quantum
ﬁeld theory Lagrangian are products of ﬁelds Φj, one ﬁeld for each particle. Each term must
conserve charge; an interaction term may create and destroy charged particles but must not
alter the net charge. As a consequence, each term has the following property: if we multiply
every ﬁeld Φj by eiθQj, where Qj is the charge of the ﬁeld (i.e. of the particles associated with
the ﬁeld) and θ is a constant, then these phases cancel in each term; the terms do not acquire
phases. Thus every quantum ﬁeld theory is invariant under eiθQ, where
eiθQΦj = eiθQjΦj .
It is plausible that the operator eiθQ leaves physical states invariant, too. However, it does not
leave Eq. (11.12) invariant. If eiθQ leaves physical states invariant, then the relative phases in
Eq. (11.12) cannot be measurable.
Here, too, we must ask what we expect to measure. Applied to the state of the whole
universe, eiθQ induces an absolute change in phase that we cannot expect to measure. However,
we can expect to measure changes of phase in one state relative to a reference state that does
not change. The challenge, then, is to build a suitable reference state. Let us build a reference
state |z⟩from a coherent superposition of mesons [5]:
|z⟩=

n
zn
(n!)1/2 |n⟩.
(11.13)
Here |n⟩is a state with n mesons, and z is a complex number. The mesons are positively
charged; a neutron absorbs one to become a proton, or a proton emits one to become a neutron.
We prepare the state |z⟩inside a cavity through which neutrons and protons pass. For the
interaction Hamiltonian, we take
Hint = g(t)(σ+a + σ−a†) ,
where σ+ turns a neutron into a proton, σ−turns a proton into a neutron, and a†, a are meson
creation and destruction operators. (The state |z⟩is an eigenstate of a with eigenvalue z.) Note
that Hint conserves charge. The coupling g(t) is 1/T during the short time T the nucleon
passes through the cavity containing the coherent state of mesons; at all other times it is zero.
(We neglect the separate Hamiltonians of the nucleon and the mesons for this short time.)
Consider an initial state

We could even prepare several meson cavities, which would deﬁne different reference phases;
to compare the phases, we could send nucleons in the same state through the different cavities.
Our conclusion from this chapter is that, contrary to the claim of Wick, Wightman and
Wigner, there are no superselection rules in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Any physically
meaningful Hermitian operator is measurable, and we ﬁnd a satisfying agreement between
quantum measurement theory and what experiments can measure. (What Hermitian operator
is not physically meaningful? An example is the vector potential A. We cannot measure A, not
because of a superselection rule, but because A lacks physical meaning.) This agreement fails
when we impose the constraints of relativity on quantum mechanics. Then we ﬁnd that some
Hermitian operators are not observables. This disagreement between quantum measurement
theory and what we can actually measure may underlie many unsatisfactory features of quantum
ﬁeld theory. (See Chap. 14.)

whenever the x and y are spacelike separated. Equation (11.16) expresses relativistic
causality: since x and y are spacelike separated, the two points cannot be causally
related; hence any operator deﬁned at x must commute with any operator deﬁned at y.

12 Quantum Slow Dance
An elegant and useful tool in quantum mechanics is the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (a
form of the adiabatic approximation) The Born–Oppenheimer approximation applies to any
system with coupled degrees of freedom, when some of them (the “fast” variables) change
quickly and all the others (the “slow” variables) change slowly. We treat the motion in two
steps. First we “freeze” the slow variables and follow the motion of the fast variables. Anyone
speeding on a bicycle past pedestrians understands this step; the pedestrians seem almost
stationary. We then compute how the slow variables respond to the average fast motion, just
as the pedestrians avoid the passing bicycle. In this approximation, the fast and slow motions
couple asymmetrically. The fast motion depends on the conﬁguration of the slow variables;
the slow motion does not depend on the conﬁguration of the fast variables, but only on their
average motion.
Another elegant and useful tool in quantum mechanics is the Feynman path integral. The
Feynman path integral and the adiabatic approximation are related. We begin this chapter
with a paradox that leads right to the adiabatic approximation and the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation, to Berry’s phase and the Feynman path integral.

Quantum Slow Dance
no time does a measurement of σx yield a value other than 1 and −1; the spin jumps from
σx = 1 to σx = −1 without passing through any intermediate value. Here is the “damned
quantum jumping around” of quantum spin. But nature jumps or not, according to which
measurements we make. Equation (12.1) represents a spin precessing with period 2π/µB. At
any time t, |ψ(t)⟩is an eigenstate of σx cos(µBt) −σy sin(µBt), so repeated measurements
of this observable do not show any damned jumping.
When does the spin jump? We do not know when it will jump, although we know when it
is likely to jump, and that it must jump between t = 0 and t = π/µB. The probability P(t)
that a measurement of σx at time t yields the result 1 is
P(t) = |⟨ψ(0)|ψ(t)⟩|2 = cos2(µBt/2) .
A measurement of σx at times close to t = 0 will likely yield 1, and a measurement of σx
at times close to t = π/µB will likely yield -1. The spin ﬂip most likely occurs around
t = π/2µB. Can we observe when the spin jumps? We can make very many measurements
of σx between t = 0 and t = π/µB – a dense set of measurements. The jump in σx must
occur between two successive measurements. When it does, we will know when the jump
occurred, to an accuracy ∆t equal to the time between the measurements. Since we can make
the measurements as dense as we like, we can make ∆t as small as we like.
But now we seem to contradict the uncertainty relation for energy and time. Section 8.5
derives the uncertainty relation
∆E∆t ≥ℏ/2
with the interpretation that ∆E is the uncertainty in the energy of a system and ∆t is the
uncertainty in the time deﬁned by the system. Here, the spin deﬁnes a moment in time by
jumping. We measure the time of the jump to an accuracy ∆t. Over a period of time ∆t the
energy is uncertain because we don’t know when the spin ﬂips. But ∆E cannot be larger than
µℏB, the energy gap between the states | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩. Hence we cannot make ∆t arbitrarily
small. Yet we can make the measurements of σx as dense as we like!
So we arrive at a paradox. The spin must ﬂip, because (by assumption) at some time we
ﬁnd the spin ﬂipped. We can certainly make measurements of σx as dense as we like, and thus
measure the time of the jump in σx as precisely as we like. Yet the uncertainty principle states
that we cannot measure the time of the jump as precisely as we like. This paradox is the quantum
Zeno paradox [2], named after the ancient Greek philosopher who tried to understand motion
by dividing time into shorter and shorter intervals, and found himself proving that motion is
impossible. The quantum Zeno paradox arises whether we consider a spin, an excited atom
decaying to its ground state, or a particle tunnelling through a potential barrier. The question
is always the same: Can we ﬁnd out when the system changes by continuously observing it?
12.2
The Adiabatic Approximation
There are no quantum jumps in this section. With no quantum jumps, this section may seem
unconnected with the last. Actually, it is closely related to the quantum Zeno paradox, but the
relation is explicit only in the next section. In this section, we eliminate quantum jumps.

12.2
The Adiabatic Approximation
163
How do we eliminate quantum jumping? Consider a closed system in an eigenstate of Hf,
a Hamiltonian with discrete, nondegenerate eigenvalues. If Hf does not depend on time, the
system never jumps to another state. What if Hf does depend on time? It can depend on time.
If we prepare the system in an eigenstate of Hf, and Hf changes quickly, the system may
jump to another state. But let Hf change adiabatically (slowly); if Hf changes slowly enough,
the system never jumps to another state. Instead of jumping, it adjusts itself to the changing
Hamiltonian. The system behaves like a heavy weight hanging on a thin string. Pull the string
quickly – it snaps and the weight falls. Pull the string slowly – the weight comes up with it.
“Slowly enough” has the following formal sense. Let Hf depend on time only through
a changing vector R. The components of R could be quantum observables, but for now let
us treat them as slowly changing (classical) parameters. The eigenvalues and eigenstates of
H depend on R, so we write H(R)|Ψi(R)⟩= Ei(R)|Ψi(R)⟩. Let a function r(t/T), for
0 ≤t ≤T, deﬁne a path in the space of parameters, and let R[t] ≡r[t/T]. That is, R[t]
evolves from the beginning to the end of the path over the time interval 0 ≤t ≤T; the larger
T, the slower the evolution. At time t = 0 we prepare the system in the state |Ψi(R[0])⟩.
According to the quantum adiabatic theorem [3], the state of the system at time t = T is
|Ψi(R[T])⟩, with probability tending to 1 as T tends to inﬁnity. At time t the state of the
system is |Ψi(R[t])⟩.
The system also acquires a phase φi(t). Thus the state of the system at time t, in the
adiabatic approximation, is
eiφi(t)|Ψi(R[t])⟩.
(12.2)
To determine φi(t), we substitute Eq. (12.2) into the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation and
take the inner product of both sides with Eq. (12.2):

The integral −

Why compute the phase? The overall phase of a quantum state has no physical meaning.
But a quantum system may be in a superposition of states, each with its own phase. The relative
phase of these states is observable. Consider two paths R[t] and R′[t] with the same endpoints
R[0] = R′[0] and R[T] = R′[T], and suppose that the system evolves in a superposition
of states |Ψ(R[t])⟩and |Ψ(R′[t])⟩. At time t = T, the relative phase of this superposition
contains two parts. One part is the relative dynamical phase (which vanishes if the states
acquire the same dynamical phase). The other part of the relative phase, Berry’s phase, is the
difference between AB integrated along R and AB integrated along R′, i.e. it is the circular
integral of AB along the closed path comprising R and R′ with opposite senses.

The relative phase is observable, hence Berry’s phase must be well deﬁned. Let’s check –

well deﬁned? Is the connection AB = ⟨Ψi(R)|i∇R|Ψi(R)⟩well deﬁned? Actually, AB
is somewhat arbitrary, because |Ψi(R)⟩is somewhat arbitrary: if we multiply |Ψi(R)⟩by a
phase factor eiΛ(R), it remains the same instantaneous eigenstate of Hf(R); but AB changes
by −∇RΛ(R). If AB is not well deﬁned, how can its integral, Berry’s phase, be well deﬁned?
This question has an elegant answer. Multiplying |Ψi(R)⟩by the phase factor eiΛ(R) is a
local phase transformation – local in R-space. It is analogous to the local phase transformation
(in x-space) of Eq. (4.3). And AB is analogous to the electromagnetic vector potential A.
Since a local phase transformation of |Ψi(R)⟩induces a gauge transformation of AB, these
two transformations go hand in hand, just as they do in Sect. 4.3. Now Berry’s phase is the
integral of AB along a closed loop; so it is gauge invariant and well deﬁned, just as the integral
of the electromagnetic vector potential along a closed loop is gauge invariant and well deﬁned
and equal to the magnetic ﬂux through the loop.
The thought experiment of Sect. 11.4 illustrates Berry’s phase. A magnetic ﬁeld slowly
rotates, and a neutron polarized along the magnetic ﬁeld rotates with it. For each complete
rotation, the neutron acquires a phase π (Berry’s phase) in addition to its dynamical phase.
This phase is observable.
Berry’s connection and Berry’s phase appear in several contexts in this chapter. In this
section, the context is the Born–Oppenheimer approximation [5]. In the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation, the components of R are not classical; they are quantum observables and may
not even commute. They evolve according to their own “slow” Hamiltonian Hs, and the
overall Hamiltonian is the sum H = Hf + Hs. By itself, the “fast” Hamiltonian Hf does not
induce quantum jumps; it does not change R, and its eigenvalues are (by assumption) discrete
and nondegenerate. The slow Hamiltonian changes R and can induce quantum jumps, which
complicate the overall evolution. Yet there is still a limit – the adiabatic limit – in which the
evolution simpliﬁes. In the adiabatic limit, we treat Hs as an arbitrarily weak perturbation on
Hf. The weaker the perturbation, the smaller the probability of transitions (quantum jumps)
among the eigenstates of Hf. The unperturbed Hilbert space for H divides into subspaces,
one for each eigenvalue Ei of Hf. In the adiabatic limit, Hs does not cause transitions among
the subspaces; the “fast” variables remain in an eigenstate |Ψi(R)⟩of Hf, with i ﬁxed, while
dynamical and Berry phases of |Ψi(R)⟩show up in H as induced scalar and vector potentials.
Let Πi denote the projector onto the subspace corresponding to Ei. These subspaces are
disjoint and form a complete set; hence [6]

i
Πi = 1 .
If the adiabatic limit is a good approximation, we can replace Hs by 
i ΠiHsΠi (no quantum
jumps) to obtain the effective Hamiltonian of Born and Oppenheimer:

12.2
The Adiabatic Approximation
165
In Heff there are induced potentials. To exhibit them, we consider [7] a generic Hamiltonian
for R and its conjugate momentum P:
Hs = P 2
2M + V (R) ,
where M is large. The sum 
i ΠiHsΠi in Heff contains products of the form
ΠiP 2Πi =

j
ΠiPΠjPΠi .
(12.4)
We can simplify Eq. (12.4) if we decompose P into two parts, P = (P −A) + A. The ﬁrst
part acts only within each subspace; that is,
[P −A, Πi] = 0 ,
(12.5)
for every i. Only the second part, A, causes transitions among the subspaces. However, A
(like a vector potential) is somewhat arbitrary: if we add to A any term that commutes with
the Πi, then A still satisﬁes Eq. (12.5). We remove this arbitrariness by requiring
ΠiAΠi = 0
(12.6)
for each i. Equations (12.5–6) deﬁne A completely. In fact,
A = P −

i
ΠiPΠi = 1

[Πi, [Πi, P]] .
(12.7)
Applying Eqs. (12.5–6) to Eq. (12.4), we get
ΠiP 2Πi =

j
Πi(P −A + A)Πj(P −A + A)Πi
= (P −A)2Πi + ΠiA2Πi .
The effective Hamiltonian for the R, then, is
Heff = Hf +

ΠiA2Πi + V (R) .
(12.8)
The sum in i is an induced scalar potential, while A is an induced vector potential.1 Indeed,
A is Berry’s connection AB in a non-abelian gauge.
As an example of an effective Hamiltonian, consider a very long, straight solenoid with all
its mass M concentrated at one end. The massive end moves freely, with coordinate R, while
the rest of the solenoid slews around in such a way as to always include the point R = 0.
The magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid is BR/R. At R = 0 sits a spin-1/2 particle with fast
Hamiltonian
Hf = µBℏ

i ΠiP 2Πi/2M is proportional to the velocity (P −A)/M of the
“slow” variables. Hence the slow variables must be slow, for the Born–Oppenheimer approximation to be applicable;
the limit M →∞is not sufﬁcient.

where µ is constant. Hf induces two subspaces, with projectors
Π± = 1 ± R · σ/R

.
(12.10)
Inserting Eq. (12.10) into Eq. (12.7), we obtain
A = [R · σ/2R, [R · σ/2R, P]] = ℏR × σ
2R2
(12.11)
as the induced vector potential for this problem. This A is guaranteed to satisfy the two
conditions (12.5–6). If we consider the subspace deﬁned by Π+, the effective Hamiltonian for
the massive end of the solenoid is
Heff = µBℏ

Thus the mass moves in a scalar potential µBℏ/2 + ℏ2/4MR2 + V (R) and an SU(2) vector
potential for an effective ﬁeld
Bi = 1
2ϵijkFjk = 1
2ϵijk(∂jAk −∂kAj −i[Aj, Ak]) = −ℏRi
2R4 (R · σ) .
(See Sect. 4.8 and Prob. 4.10.) Since σ · R/R = 1 in this subspace, we have B = −ℏR/2R3.
The solution to Eqs. (12.5–6) yields an effective magnetic monopole at R = 0 – the mass at R
behaves like a charge in the ﬁeld of a monopole at the origin! The induced ﬁeld B is abelian,
although the abelian monopole appears in a non-abelian representation: it has no string.
We can generalize this result to arbitrary spin; if we write Eqs. (12.5–6) as algebraic
equations, the result holds for any representation of the algebra. So instead of Eq. (12.5) we
write
[P −A, Hf] = 0 .
(12.5′)
Equation (12.5′) is equivalent to Eq. (12.5) if the eigenvalues of Hf are independent of R, as
they are in Eq. (12.9). Instead of Eq. (12.6) we write
A = [Hf, Λ] ,
(12.6′)
for some Λ. Equation (12.6′) implies Eq. (12.6) because if A satisﬁes Eq. (12.6′) then, for
every i,
ΠiAΠi = Πi[Hf, Λ]Πi
= Πi [

j
ΠjHfΠj, Λ] Πi = 0 .
For Hf = µBR · S/R we have A = [Hf, iS/µBℏR] = R × S/R2 as the solution to
Eqs. (12.5′-6′), thus the induced ﬁeld is B = −(R · S)R/R4 for arbitrary spin S.
So far we have assumed the eigenvalues of Hf to be discrete and nondegenerate. If Hf has
a discrete and degenerate eigenvalue, Berry’s phase (and the induced ﬁeld) may be non-abelian

[8]. The eigenstates belonging to this eigenvalue do not (in the adiabatic approximation) jump
to eigenstates belonging to other eigenvalues, but they may mix among themselves.
The
mixing amounts to multiplication by a non-abelian phase (i.e., a unitary matrix). Consider, for
example, the Hamiltonian
H = P 2
2M + V (R) + g(R · S/R)2 ,
with S representing a spin-3/2 particle. The fast Hamiltonian Hf = g(R · S/R)2 has two
degenerate eigenvalues, gℏ2/4 and 9gℏ2/4. What potential A satisﬁes the equations for the
vector potential? Applying Eq. (12.7) we ﬁnd
A =

The induced ﬁeld is
B = (R · S)R

R2 (R · S)2] .
For the states with R·S/R = ±3ℏ/2, B reduces to −(R·S)R/R4 as in the abelian example; it
just happens that these two degenerate states do not mix. For the states with R·S/R = ±ℏ/2,
however, we ﬁnd B = 3(R · S)R/R4, which is −3 times the abelian example; for these states
B contains a truly non-abelian contribution.
12.3
Feynman Paths
Alongside the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg formulations of quantum mechanics is the Feynman
path integral formulation [9]. Feynman considered all possible paths of a particle from an initial
spacetime point (xi, ti) to a ﬁnal spacetime point (xf, tf). To each path x(t) he assigned a
phase
ei
 tf
ti Ldt/ℏ,
where L is the classical Lagrangian evaluated along the path. Feynman’s path integral is a
normalized sum of the phases of all these paths, and equals the value of the wave function of
the particle at the point xf at time tf, if at time ti the particle was at xi.
We may object that quantum particles do not move along paths. A path that deﬁnes the
position and velocity of a particle at each moment violates the uncertainty principle. How
can the path integral be consistent with the “quantum jumping around” of an electron in an
atom? To answer this objection, let us return to the quantum Zeno paradox of Sect. 12.1.
Once we resolve the paradox, we will appreciate the physical meaning of a Feynman path, and
will see how the path integral formulation follows from the formulations of Schr¨odinger and
Heisenberg.
A direct way to resolve the quantum Zeno paradox is to calculate what happens. The state
of the spin is |ψ(0)⟩= (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩)/
√
2 at time t = 0. Suppose we measure σx a total of N

168
12
Quantum Slow Dance
times, at equal time intervals, over a period of time T. The interval between measurements
is T/N. What is the probability of ﬁnding the spin unchanged after the ﬁrst measurement?
According to Eq. (12.1), the state at time t = T/N is
1
√
2

eiµBT/2N| ↑⟩+ e−iµBT/2N| ↓⟩

,
so the probability of ﬁnding the spin unchanged is cos2(µBT/2N). Hence the probability
of ﬁnding the spin unchanged at time T, after N measurements, is cos2N(µBT/2N). As N
approaches inﬁnity, cos2N(µBT/2N) approaches 1. (See Prob. 12.8.) So the spin never ﬂips!
In particular, consider the spin between the times t = 0 and t = T = π/µB. If we measure σx
only at time t = T, we will certainly ﬁnd the spin ﬂipped; if we measure σx densely between
t = 0 and t = T, we will not ﬁnd the spin ﬂipped at any time. If we continuously observe a
quantum jump, it never occurs. A watched pot never boils.
Shades of Zeno! We have proved that motion is impossible. But motion is not always
impossible. At any time t, the state |ψ(t)⟩in Eq. (12.1) is an eigenstate of σx cos(µBt) −
σy sin(µBt), so repeated measurements of this operator shows the spin to be precessing as
in Eq. (12.1).
Motion is possible.
Yet the resolution of the quantum Zeno paradox is a
surprise. Consider an experiment that is dual to the previous one, in the following sense:
instead of continuously observing σx on a spin that is precessing, we continuously observe
σx cos(µBt) −σy sin(µBt) on a spin that is not precessing. The Hamiltonian vanishes; there
is no magnetic ﬁeld. But now we measure σx cos(µBt)−σy sin(µBt) at times t = nπ/µBN,
where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N. In the limit N →∞, we ﬁnd the spin precessing just as it did before;
each measurement of σx cos(µBt) −σy sin(µBt) yields 1. Here continuous observation –
rather than a magnetic ﬁeld – causes the spin to precess. A watched pot boils – without a stove!
We can continuously observe any quantum state. If we continuously observe a decaying
atom, it never decays; if we continuously check whether a particle has crossed a barrier, it
never crosses. We can make a free particle scatter off a force-free region just by constantly
checking whether the particle has entered the region. Indeed, we can induce any evolution we
want in a quantum system.
Here is a general proof that continuous observation dictates the evolution of a quantum
system. Let |Ψ(R)⟩, the state of a quantum system, depend parametrically on a vector R; R
could represent e.g. the polarization direction of a spin as in Prob. 12.4, or the displacement of
a localized state as in Prob. 12.7. The vector R changes in time along a smooth path R[t]. We
check whether the system evolves along the path R[t] by making a dense set of measurements.
Deﬁne tn ≡nT/N, where n = 1, . . . , N. At times t = tn we check whether the system
is in the state |Ψ(R[tn])⟩. Assuming we ﬁnd it in the state |Ψ(R[tn])⟩at time t = tn, what
is the probability we will ﬁnd the system in the state |Ψ(R[tn+1])⟩at time t = tn+1? It is
|K(tn+1, tn)|2, where
K(tn+1, tn) ≡⟨Ψ(R[tn+1])|e−iHT/Nℏ|Ψ(R[tn])⟩
and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. Now we evaluate K(tn+1, tn) to order T/N. To this
order, K(tn+1, tn) reduces to two factors. One is a phase factor,
e−i⟨H⟩T/Nℏ,
(12.12)

12.3
Feynman Paths
169
arising from the Hamiltonian: ⟨H⟩is the expectation value of H in the state |Ψ(R[tn])⟩. The
second factor in K(tn+1, tn) is
⟨Ψ(R[tn+1])|Ψ(R[tn])⟩.
(12.13)
To order T/N, it, too, is a phase factor. We can write it
1 −T
N ⟨Ψ(R[tn])| d
dtn
|Ψ(R[tn])⟩.
(12.14)
Since K(tn+1, tn) reduces to a phase factor, to order T/N, the probability |K(tn+1, tn)|2
equals 1 to order T/N. It then follows from Prob. 12.8 that the probability for the system to
be in the state |Ψ(R[tn])⟩at time t = tn for all n approaches 1 as N approaches inﬁnity – the
limit of continuous observation. The quantum world fulﬁlls our every expectation; it conﬁrms
all our hopes, and also all our fears. Hence, be an optimist!
At time t = tN = T, we ﬁnd the system in the state |Ψ(R[T])⟩, up to a phase factor.
An overall phase is not measurable. All the same, we will compute it; we will discover in it
the relative phase of a Feynman path, and then derive the path integral. The phase is the sum
of the phases in Eq. (12.12) and Eq. (12.14) for all n. The product over all n of Eq. (12.12)
approaches eiΦD, where the dynamical phase ΦD is
ΦD = −
 T
0
⟨Ψ(R[t])|H|Ψ(R[t])⟩dt/ℏ;
(12.15)
ΦD generalizes the dynamical phase of Sect. 12.2. (In Sect. 12.2, |Ψ(R)⟩is an eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian with eigenvalue Ei and ΦD reduces to −
 T
0 Eidt/ℏ.) The product over all n
of Eq. (12.14) approaches eiΦB, where ΦB is the integral of Berry’s connection:
ΦB =
 R[T ]
R[0]
⟨Ψ(R)|i∇R|Ψ(R)⟩· dR .
(12.16)
Although this integral is not invariant under a change in the phase of |Ψ(R)⟩, the path integral
depends only on relative phases among paths, and the relative phase is invariant. The evolution
of |Ψ(R)⟩is not adiabatic here – |Ψ(R)⟩evolves according to continuous observation – but
we can still deﬁne (and measure) ΦB for any R[t] that deﬁnes a closed path in Hilbert space
[10]. (See Prob. 12.10.)
Let us now show that the sum of phases ΦB +ΦD equals the time integral of the Lagrangian
of the system, divided by ℏ. We assume a generic Hamiltonian H = p2/2m + V (x) for a
three-dimensional particle. For |Ψ(R)⟩we take the normalized wave packet
|X, P⟩= (π∆2)−3/4e−(x−X)2/2∆2eiP·x/ℏ,
(12.17)
a coherent state in the six-dimensional phase space of the particle. The parameters X, P
represent displacements in phase space. Consider a smooth path X[t], P[t] in phase space and
a sequence of measurements to check whether the particle is in the state |X[t], P[t]⟩at time t.
As the measurements become denser (the limit of continuous observation), the probability to

ﬁnd the particle evolving along this path approaches 1. What is its phase? To obtain ΦD we
compute
⟨X, P|H|X, P⟩= ⟨X, P|[ p2

2m|0, 0⟩.
(12.18)
The term ⟨0, 0|(p2/2m)|0, 0⟩in Eq. (12.18) is the same for all the paths and we drop it,
integrating the other terms to obtain ΦD. To obtain ΦB we compute the Berry connection:
⟨X, P|i∇X|X, P⟩= 0 ,
⟨X, P|i∇P|X, P⟩= −X/ℏ.
(12.19)
Integrating the connection by parts we have ΦB = −

As N tends to inﬁnity, the paths in the Feynman path integral become inﬁnitely kinky; only a
subset of the paths, of measure zero, are smooth as we have assumed in deriving Eq. (12.20).
Yet Eq. (12.23) remains valid in the limit N →∞. (See Prob. 12.14.) The square of the
absolute value of Eq. (12.23) is the probability density for a particle at X0 at time t = 0 to be
at XN at time t = T.
12.4
Classical Analogues
Section 12.2 presents Berry’s phase as a quantum effect, which, of course, it is. But Berry’s
phase has a classical analogue: Hannay’s angle [12]. (See Prob. 12.15.) It is not surprising
that Berry’s phase, which shows up in the classical action of a path integral, has a classical
analogue. The Born–Oppenheimer approximation, too, has a classical analogue. But some
quantum effects do not have classical analogues. (See Chap. 6.) What does it mean for a
quantum effect to have – or not have – a classical analogue?
Both Berry’s phase and the Aharonov–Bohm effect can affect electron interference. Con-
sider an example of a two-slit experiment in which polarized electrons pass through a magnetic
ﬁeld, constant in magnitude but not in direction. (See Fig. 12.1.) Suppose that the electrons are
initially polarized along the magnetic ﬁeld. Then, if the change in the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld is sufﬁciently gradual, the electrons will remain polarized along the ﬁeld, and rotate with
it. If the amount of rotation depends on the path of the electron, a Berry phase will appear as a
Figure 12.1: A two-slit interference experiment with a
magnetic ﬁeld. The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld is
constant, but its direction is not: in the region of the lower
wave packet the direction is constant, while in the region
of the upper wave packet the direction gradually sweeps
out a cone, in such a way that the initial and ﬁnal directions
in the upper region coincide with the direction in the lower
region.
2The reduction leaves behind the end terms [X0P0 −XNPN]/ℏthat appear in Eq. (12.20); they are arbitrary in
the limit ∆→0 and we drop them.

shift in the pattern of interference between the two paths, just as if the paths went either side of
a shielded solenoid. But the Berry phase has a classical analogue; the Aharonov–Bohm effect
does not.
There is another difference between the Berry phase and the Aharonov–Bohm effect. The
Berry phase, unlike the Aharonov–Bohm effect, arises locally. Suppose that many physicists
probe the region where the electrons go – and only this region; each physicist, working alone,
checks a small, simply connected part of the region. The physicists then organize a conference
and compare their results. If they measured the magnetic ﬁeld everywhere in the region where
the electrons pass, they can predict the shift in the electron interference due to Berry’s phase.
They do not have to do the interference experiment. But whatever they measure, they cannot
predict the shift due to the Aharonov–Bohm effect; the vector potential is not measurable. They
have to do the interference experiment to see the nonlocal exchange of modular momentum.
Nonlocal dynamical quantum effects have no classical analogues.

∗12.15 A classical adiabatic theorem [14] applies to certain classical systems that depend on

φ variables that are canonically conjugate. In the adiabatic limit, I is a constant of
the motion, the analogue of the energy quantum number. Hannay’s angle is an extra
shift in φ that a system acquires during a complete circuit in R, relative to the time
integral of the instantaneous angular frequency. The classical analogue of the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation applies to coupled fast and slow motion, where the fast
motion is periodic up to gradual changes due to the adiabatic change in R. For a
slow classical Hamiltonian Hs = P 2/2M + V (R), the condition corresponding to
Eq. (12.5) is [15]
{P −A, I} = 0 .
To ﬁx A we need a condition analogous to Eq. (12.6). Eq. (12.6) requires that the

13 Charges and Fluxons
Previous chapters of this book treat quantum measurements within nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics, where they correspond well with what experiments can measure. In the next
chapter, quantum measurements go relativistic – and the correspondence breaks down. Here,
however, we take a break from quantum measurements. This chapter is exceptional in another
respect, too. While other chapters begin with quantum paradoxes, this one begins with a
classical (relativistic) paradox [1]. Although the paradox is entirely classical, its discussion and
resolution came as late as 1967. No one seems to have noticed it before. The paradox is crucial
for clarifying the entirely quantum interactions of “ﬂuxons” and charges – the generalized
Aharonov–Bohm effect of this chapter.

Hidden Momentum?
Consider two inﬁnitely long, concentric cylinders. One ﬁts inside the other, but the cylinders
have nearly the same radius rc. (See Fig. 13.1.) The cylinders carry equal and opposite charge,
uniformly distributed, and have the same mass. They rotate in opposite senses, with equal

angular speeds; hence they have zero total angular momentum. At a distance x0 > rc from
the common axis of the cylinders, there is a heavy particle with charge Q. It does not move
relative to this axis. Now suppose that the cylinders gradually stop rotating, because of slight
friction between them. What happens?
Initially, the rotating cylinders enclose a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. This magnetic ﬁeld
slowly drops to zero as the cylinders stop rotating. Maxwell’s equations imply that the changing
magnetic ﬂux generates an electric ﬁeld that circulates around the cylinders; this circulating
electric ﬁeld makes the charged particle accelerate. Now that is odd: the linear momentum of
the particle was zero, and it is no longer zero; the total linear momentum of the cylinders was
zero and it remains zero. Yet no external forces act on the charged particle and the cylinders.
What happened to conservation of momentum?
Are we perhaps missing something? According to Poynting’s theorem, there is momentum
in the electromagnetic ﬁeld, too. The ﬁeld momentum Pfield is
Pfield =
1
4πc

(E × B)d3x .
(13.1)
To calculate Pfield, let the z-axis be the common axis of the cylinders and let the charged
particle lie initially on the x-axis. If the charge is far from the cylinders – i.e., if x0 ≫rc
– then inside the cylinders, the electric ﬁeld E due to the charge is essentially independent
of x and y (though dependent on z). The initial electromagnetic momentum points along the
y-axis, as does the induced momentum of the charged particle. Do the electromagnetic and
mechanical momenta have the same magnitude, too? The only component of the electric ﬁeld
contributing to Pfield is Ex, and at a point on the z-axis it has magnitude
Ex =
Qx0
(x2
0 + z2)3/2 ;
hence the magnitude of Pfield is
Pfield = πrc2Qx0B
4πc
 ∞
−∞

(x2
0 + z2)3/2 = QBrc2

(13.2)
On the other hand, Maxwell’s equations yield the magnitude of the transient electric ﬁeld at
the position of the charge:
2πx0Ey = −1
c
dΦ
dt ,
where Φ is the magnetic ﬂux in the cylinders. The force on the charged particle is QEy, so the
momentum of the charge, after the cylinders have stopped rotating, has magnitude
Py =
 ∞
−∞
dtQEy = QBrc2
2x0c
,
(13.3)
and equals Pfield. Thus we have conﬁrmed the conservation of momentum. Odd or not, the
charged particle has to accelerate in order to conserve the initial momentum in the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, as the cylinders stop rotating. Indeed, this example shows why there must be
momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld [2].

13.1
Hidden Momentum?
179
However, the closer we look at this resolution of the paradox, the less satisfactory it appears.
Initially, the cylinders rotate and the charge is a distance x0 from the axis of the cylinders, and
stationary. We calculated that the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is QBrc2/2x0c and
points along the y-axis. Now let us move the charge along the x-axis to a new position a distance
x′
0 from the axis of the cylinders. We move it as slowly as we like, so that the charge scarcely
induces a magnetic ﬁeld; meanwhile, the magnetic ﬂux in the cylinders does not change (if
we neglect the friction between the cylinders). Then, when the charge has reached its new
position, the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has changed to QBrc2/2x′
0c (along the
y-axis). But the charge has not acquired any momentum along the y-axis. What happened to
conservation of momentum?
We have assumed that the cylinders are inﬁnitely long. Could the paradox be due to
this unphysical assumption? Prob. 13.1 implies that it is not. Moreover, this paradox has
another formulation, based on the following theorem: The total momentum in any stationary,
localized distribution of matter is zero. For example, Fig. 13.2 shows a toroidal solenoid with
a positively charged particle at its center; the charged particle does not move, and the current
in the solenoid is constant, so this matter distribution is stationary and localized. There are no
inﬁnitely long cylinders here. But the momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld need not vanish.
If the electromagnetic momentum does not vanish, how can the total momentum vanish?
To prove the theorem, we deﬁne the stress (or energy-momentum) tensor T µν, a function
of space and time. The components of T µν represent local densities of energy and momentum
and their ﬂuxes: T 00/c2 is the local density of mass, T 0i/c is the local density of the i-
th component of momentum, and T ij is the local ﬂux density in the direction j of the i-th
component of momentum. (Here 1 ≤i, j ≤3.) The total stress tensor includes the energy
and momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld as well as any mechanical energy and momentum.
From local conservation of energy and momentum, we infer that T µν satisﬁes the equation

∂µT µν = 0 ,
(13.4)
where ∂0 ≡∂t/c ≡(1/c)∂/∂t and ∂i ≡∂/∂xi. Equation (13.4) is analogous to the continuity
equation for electric charge and current. (See Prob. 13.2.)

Charges and Fluxons
Since the matter distribution is localized, mechanical energy and momentum vanish beyond
a certain distance. Also, electric and magnetic ﬁelds of localized charges and currents fall
off according to the square of the distance, or faster, at large distances; hence T µν falls off
according to the fourth power of the distance, or faster. We now compute the total mechanical
and electromagnetic momentum of the matter distribution. It is the integral over all space of
the momentum density:

The second line of Eq. (13.5) contains two integrals. The ﬁrst integral reduces (by the diver-
gence theorem) to a surface integral:

where dSj is an oriented area element for the surface bounding the volume of integration. This
integral must vanish because, at large distances, the area of the surface grows as the square of
the distance, while the integrand falls off as the third power of the distance or faster. The second
integral vanishes because the matter distribution is stationary, i.e. ∂0T µν = 0; then Eq. (13.4)
implies that 
j ∂jT 0j = 0. Hence from Eq. (13.5) we infer that the total momentum P i is
zero.
Now back to Fig. 13.2. Let us suppose that the coils of the solenoid are not conducting
wires; rather, they are neutral glass tubes through which a gas of electrons ﬂows. The tubes
are covered on the outside with a positive surface charge that cancels the electric ﬁeld of the
electrons. A dilute gas of electrons does not screen the electric ﬁeld of the positive charge
at the center of the solenoid. Hence the electromagnetic momentum of this conﬁguration is
not zero; the crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds within the solenoid yield an electromagnetic
momentum parallel to the axis of symmetry of the solenoid. According to our theorem, then,
the total mechanical momentum cannot be zero. But where is this mechanical momentum?
13.2
Duality of the Aharonov–Bohm Effect
Let’s try out a model Lagrangian for an electron and an inﬁnitely thin solenoid or idealized
ﬂux line – a “ﬂuxon”. For simplicity, let space be two-dimensional; then we can represent both
the ﬂuxon and the electron as points on a plane, with the magnetic ﬁeld vanishing everywhere
except at the location of the ﬂuxon. (We have not changed the topology – a closed electron
path has the same winding number whether it winds around a line in three dimensions or a
point in two dimensions.) Let R represent the position of the ﬂuxon, and r the position of the
electron. If position of the ﬂuxon is ﬁxed, a Lagrangian for the electron is
L = m
2 ˙r2 + e
cA(r −R) · ˙r ,
(13.6)

13.2
Duality of the Aharonov–Bohm Effect
181
where ˙r = dr/dt and A(r −R) is a vector potential, a function of the relative distance r −R.
This Lagrangian leads to the correct equation of motion for the electron,
m¨rj = m d
dt ˙rj = e
c

i
˙ri(∂jAi −∂iAj) ,
with m¨r equal to the Lorentz force. What if the ﬂuxon moves, too? We can modify Eq. (13.6)
by adding a kinetic term for the ﬂuxon,
L = m
2 ˙r2 + M
2
˙R2 + e
cA(r −R) · ˙r ,
(13.7)
but we obtain an incorrect equation of motion for the electron:
m¨rj = e
c

i
˙ri(∂jAi −∂iAj) + e
c

i
˙Ri∂iAj .
It contains, in addition to the Lorentz force, a force that is not gauge invariant, acting on the
electron even where the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes. We can see what is wrong directly from the
Lagrangian. Suppose that for A in Eq. (13.7) we substitute A = ∇rΛ for some single-valued
scalar function Λ(r −R), so the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes everywhere (even at the location of
the ﬂuxon); then there is no interaction, and the interaction term in Eq. (13.7) should reduce
to a total time derivative. But ∇rΛ(r −R)˙r is not a total time derivative. On the other hand,
∇rΛ(r −R)(˙r −˙R) is a total time derivative. If we replace ˙r by ˙r −˙R in this term we obtain
L = m
2 ˙r2 + M
2
˙R2 + e
cA(r −R) · (˙r −˙R) .
(13.8)
Now Eq. (13.8) implies a gauge-invariant force that vanishes along with the magnetic ﬁeld:
m¨r = e
c(˙r −˙R) × B = −M ¨R ,
(13.9)
where B = ∇r × A(r −R). If Eq. (13.9) is valid, the electron and the ﬂuxon exert a force on
each other only when they touch, and their total momentum is a constant of the motion.
Is Eq. (13.9) valid? As an equation of motion for a classical model, it is certainly valid.
A subtler question is whether Eqs. (13.8–9) yield a valid quantum model. Equations (13.8–9)
treat the electron and ﬂuxon on an equal footing. We know that an electron diffracting around
a ﬂuxon acquires a topological phase. This model therefore implies that a ﬂuxon diffracting
around an electron acquires a topological phase. Does it?
Consider an electron passing a stationary ﬂuxon. If the electron is a quantum particle, it
can divide into two wave packets as it passes the ﬂuxon. Let the ﬂuxon, too, divide into two
wave packets, before the electron passes, such that only one of the two ﬂuxon wave packets lies
betweenthetwoelectronwavepacketsastheypass. (SeeFig.13.3.) Nowlettwoexperimenters,
Alice and Bob, observe the electron and the ﬂuxon, respectively. After the electron passes,
they each perform one of two measurements. Alice can perform a measurement that reveals
which path the electron took, or a measurement that reveals the relative phase between the
electron wave packets. These complementary measurements are analogous to measurements

in a double-slit experiment. Similarly, Bob can measure either the position of the ﬂuxon or
the relative phase of the ﬂuxon wave packets, after the electron goes by. Let us anticipate the
results of their measurements.
At the beginning of the experiment, the state |Ψin⟩of the ﬂuxon and the electron is a
product state:
|Ψin⟩= 1
2(|f1⟩+ |f2⟩) ⊗(|e1⟩+ |e2⟩) ,
where |f1⟩and |f2⟩represent the two ﬂuxon wave packets and |e1⟩and |e2⟩represent the two
electron wave packets. The state |Ψfin⟩, after the electron has passed the ﬂuxon, is no longer
a product state; the relative phase between |e1⟩and |e2⟩depends on the ﬂuxon position:
|Ψfin⟩= 1
2|f1⟩⊗(|e1⟩+ |e2⟩) + 1
2|f2⟩⊗(|e1⟩+ eiφAB|e2⟩) .
Here φAB is the Aharonov–Bohm phase, and |f2⟩represents the ﬂuxon positioned between
the two electron wave packets. Now suppose that Bob measures the position of the ﬂuxon and
Alice measures the relative phase of the electron. By repeating this experiment many times
and comparing their results, Alice and Bob conﬁrm the Aharonov–Bohm effect: Alice ﬁnds
the relative phase φAB if and only if Bob ﬁnds the ﬂuxon between the two electron paths.
However, we can rewrite |Ψfin⟩as follows:
|Ψfin⟩= 1
2(|f1⟩+ |f2⟩) ⊗|e1⟩+ 1
2(|f1⟩+ eiφAB|f2⟩) ⊗|e2⟩.
This simple rewriting has a profound consequence. Now suppose that Bob measures the relative
phase of the ﬂuxon and Alice measures the position of the electron. They will discover an
effect that is dual to the Aharonov–Bohm effect: the ﬂuxon acquires the phase φAB if and only
if the electron passes between the two ﬂuxon wave packets. To complete the duality, we can
choose a reference frame in which the ﬂuxon passes by the stationary electron. (The relative
phase between two wave packets cannot depend on the reference frame.) Then we ﬁnd the
same relative phase whether the electron paths enclose the ﬂuxon or the ﬂuxon paths enclose
the electron.
This duality is just what Eqs. (13.8–9) imply. If an electron acquires a phase by encircling
a stationary ﬂuxon, a ﬂuxon acquires the same phase by encircling a stationary electron.
Equations (13.8–9) are just a two-dimensional model, but Eq. (13.9) is gauge invariant, and it

13.3
The Aharonov–Bohm Effect and Berry’s Phase
183
implies (correctly) that the electron and the ﬂuxon, when they do not touch, share a phase. These
features make Eqs. (13.8–9) a model worth studying, a model combining the Aharonov–Bohm
effect with Berry’s phase.
13.3
The Aharonov–Bohm Effect and Berry’s Phase
An electron winding around a solenoid acquires an Aharonov–Bohm phase. This phase is
topological: it is proportional to the winding number of the electron path around the solenoid.
If the enclosed ﬂux is Φ and the path winds n times around the solenoid, the Aharonov–Bohm
phase is φAB = neΦ/ℏc. But what if the solenoid is neither inside the closed electron path
nor outside it, but on it? The question makes no sense if the electron is a classical point
charge, because – assuming that the electron does not penetrate the solenoid – it must pass
the solenoid on one side or the other. But the Aharonov–Bohm effect is a quantum effect, and
a quantum electron propagates as a wave packet. This electron “cloud” could pass on both
sides of a well shielded solenoid without ever penetrating it. Suppose it does; what would the
Aharonov–Bohm phase be?
We can apply the model of the last section, Eq. (13.8), to this question. Treat the solenoid
as a ﬂuxon that moves while remaining perpendicular to a ﬁxed plane, and an electron that
moves in the plane. The effective Hamiltonian in two dimensions is
H = (p −eA/c)2
2m
+ V (r) + (P + eA/c)2
2M
,
(13.10)
where p and m are the momentum and mass of the electron, respectively, and P and M are
the momentum and mass of the ﬂuxon. For the vector potential A we take
A = Φ
2π ∇rθ(r −R) ,
(13.11)
where θ(r −R) is the (multivalued) angle of the vector r −R relative to a ﬁxed vector in
the plane, and Φ is the ﬂux of the ﬂuxon. Equation (13.10) includes a binding potential V (r)
for the electron; it is convenient to bind the electron in a ﬁxed potential. What happens if the
ﬂuxon passes through the electron cloud? We cannot give a general answer, but if the ﬂuxon
moves slowly, we can study this model in the adiabatic approximation. (See Sect. 12.2.) If,
in addition, the ﬂuxon carries ﬂux Φ = hc/2e – i.e., if it is a semiﬂuxon – the analysis of the
model becomes simple and elegant.
Why a semiﬂuxon? To see what makes a semiﬂuxon special, let us deﬁne a rather artiﬁcial
time-reversal operation T sending p →−p, P →−P. (It is artiﬁcial because a true time-
reversal operation would send A →−A, as well. See Sect. 10.2.) In general, T is not a
symmetry of Eq. (13.10), because A ̸= −A. But in the special case of a semiﬂuxon, the
difference between A and −A is A −(−A) = 2A = (ℏc/e)∇rθ(r −R); it has the same
form as Eq. (13.11) but corresponds to Φ = hc/e – one ﬂux quantum – at r = R. Any multiple
of the ﬂux quantum is physically indistinguishable from no ﬂux, hence A →−A is a pure
gauge transformation. (See also Prob. 13.5.)

184
13
Charges and Fluxons
It follows that T is a symmetry of H, in some gauge.1 Now let the semiﬂuxon slowly
move along a closed loop C. The adiabatic motion alters the state of the electron by an overall
phase factor, which in general includes a Berry phase ΦB(C) as well as a dynamical phase
ΦD. Time-reversal symmetry implies that the state acquires the same overall phase factor
eiΦDeiΦB(C) if the semiﬂuxon moves along C in the opposite direction. (See Eq. (10.4).) The
dynamical phase is the same in the two cases, but the Berry phase changes sign. (See Eq. 12.3.)
Since the overall phase factor is the same, we have
eiΦDeiΦB(C) = eiΦDe−iΦB(C) ;
hence the Berry phase ΦB(C) can only be 0 or π (up to a multiple of 2π).
Now that is a surprise. What becomes of the phase ΦB(C) as we deform the path C?
Suppose the electron cloud lies entirely within a ﬁnite region S. Figure 13.4 shows a closed
ﬂuxon path C1 outside the region S without enclosing it. For this path, both the Aharonov–
Bohm phase and Berry’s phase vanish. Now let us deform the path C1 into a large loop C2
that encloses the region S without touching it. For this path Berry’s phase equals π and it is
entirely the Aharonov–Bohm phase, since the path encloses all the charge.2 We can distort C1
into C2 in many steps, enlarging the loop by an inﬁnitesimal region at each step. We might
have expected the phase ΦB of the loop to rise gradually from 0 to π – but we have discovered
that ΦB can only be 0 or π. It follows that some inﬁnitesimal region contains a “singular point”
P such that ΦB jumps when we annex this inﬁnitesimal region. But only degeneracy between
states of the electron can cause such a jump in Berry’s phase. (See Prob. 13.8.) Hence for any
binding potential V (r) there exists a point P such that, if a semiﬂuxon is introduced there, the
state of the electron becomes degenerate with another state.
We see that, in the adiabatic limit, the Aharonov–Bohm phase and Berry’s phase combine is
a subtle way. We referred to ΦB(C) as Berry’s phase; but when the loop C encloses the entire
electron cloud without touching it, ΦB(C) is simply the Aharonov–Bohm phase. When C is
an inﬁnitesimal loop about a point of degeneracy, ΦB(C) appears as Berry’s adiabatic phase;
but even for an inﬁnitesimal loop, we can interpret ΦB(C) as the Aharonov–Bohm phase.
(See Prob. 13.6.) What is striking is that the Aharonov–Bohm and Berry phases combine in
a topological phase that depends only on the winding number of the ﬂuxon path around the
point P in the electron cloud.

1Explicitly, the gauge transformation that makes T a symmetry of H is A →A −∇r(ℏc/2e)¯θ(r −R), where
¯θ(r −R) is the single-valued form of θ(r −R) and jumps by 2π along a half-line of constant (r −R)/|r −R|.
(See Prob. 13.6.) In this gauge A vanishes except along the half-line.
2The Aharonov–Bohm phase, unlike Berry’s phase, is deﬁned even when the motion is not adiabatic; here, however,
the motion is adiabatic and Berry’s phase includes the Aharonov–Bohm phase.

The Aharonov–Casher Effect

13.4
The Aharonov–Casher Effect
The topology of the Aharonov–Bohm effect is the same in two dimensions as in three: a closed
electron path has the same winding number whether it winds around a point in two dimensions
or a line in three dimensions. So a problem involving electrons and ﬂuxons in three dimensions
often reduces to an effective problem in two dimensions. However, although there is just one
way to go from three dimensions to two, there are two inequivalent ways to go back. The
familiar way is to turn ﬂuxons back into lines; but we could also turn electrons into lines of
charge, leaving the ﬂuxons as points. Both ways preserve the topology. What happens if we
go the unfamiliar way?
In two dimensions, an electron and a (neutral) ﬂuxon are dual.
(See Sect. 13.2.)
A
closed ﬂuxon path around the electron, and a closed electron path around the ﬂuxon, yield
the same phase φAB. If we go the unfamiliar way back to three dimensions, we arrive at
a new topological effect, dual to the Aharonov–Bohm effect in three dimensions: a neutral
“ﬂuxon particle”, diffracting around a charged wire, should acquire a topological phase, just
like a charged particle diffracting around a line of ﬂux [3]. The neutron, with its intrinsic
magnetic moment, is an example of a ﬂuxon particle. (But unlike a solenoid, a neutron has
a nonvanishing ﬁeld around it.) Hence a neutron should acquire a topological phase when it
diffracts around a line of charge. This effect, the Aharonov–Casher effect, has been observed
experimentally [4].
Topology aside, are the two effects truly dual? What is so striking about the Aharonov–
Bohm effect is that, even if the magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid vanishes all along the path of
the electron, the electron acquires an observable phase. In the Aharonov–Casher effect, the
neutron plows right through the electric ﬁeld of the line of charge. The two effects are not
similar in this respect. The question, however, is whether the electric ﬁeld acts on the neutron.
Does the line of charge exert a force on the neutron? If – and only if – it exerts no force on the
neutron are the Aharonov–Bohm and Aharonov–Casher effects truly dual.
To address this question, consider an inﬁnitely long, straight solenoid that passes an in-
ﬁnitely long, straight line of charge; the solenoid and the line of charge remain parallel at all
times. (See Fig. 13.5.) We know that the solenoid and the line of charge exert no force on each
other. (See Sect. 13.2.) Now, a solenoid is equivalent to an inﬁnite stack of identical current

loops; each current loop is a magnetic dipole, like a neutron. Suppose the line of charge exerts
a force on one of the current loops in the stack. By symmetry, it exerts the same force on all
the current loops in the stack. But the sum of these forces vanishes: the line of charge exerts
no force on the solenoid itself. We conclude, therefore, that an inﬁnitely long, straight line of
charge exerts no force on a current loop with polarization parallel to the line of charge.3
This conclusion seems, at ﬁrst, paradoxical. The line of charge is the source for an electric
ﬁeld E, while the magnetic ﬁeld B vanishes. But since the neutron moves relative to the line
of charge, the neutron encounters a magnetic ﬁeld B′; B′ is the Lorentz transform of E to the
rest frame of the neutron. The Lorentz transformation for B′ is [5]
B′ = γ(B −v
c × E) −
γ2
c2(γ + 1)v(v · B) = −γ v
c × E ,
where v is the velocity of the neutron with respect to the line of charge and γ = (1−v2/c2)−1/2.
For the force F on a current loop with magnetic dipole moment µ in a magnetic ﬁeld B we
have a familiar formula:
F = ∇(µ · B) ,
(13.12)
so the force on the current loop does not vanish – µ · B′ is not constant in space.
We conclude that there is no force on a moving current loop – and also that there is a force!
Which conclusion is right? In trying to resolve this paradox, we might recall the paradox of
Sect. 13.1. Both versions of the paradox of Sect. 13.1 imply that there can be mechanical
momentum that is hidden from us – so far, at least. If hidden momentum resolves the paradox
of Sect. 13.1, perhaps hidden momentum resolves the paradox here, as well. So let us return
to the toroidal solenoid with the positive charge at its center, in Fig. 13.2. Where could the
mechanical momentum be hidden? For mechanical momentum, there must be moving parts.
The positive charge does not move, but the solenoid has moving parts: there are electrons
ﬂowing in the tubes of the solenoid. The electrons have momentum, and they respond to the
positive charge by speeding up on their way in (towards the axis of symmetry of the solenoid)
and slowing down on their way out. Hence, their momentum on the inner side of the torus
exceeds their momentum on the outer side of the torus, and there is net mechanical momentum
along the axis of the torus.
Eureka! This must be the resolution of the paradox. The only problem with this resolution
is that a simple calculation disproves it. Consider a single tube in the solenoid. The linear
momentum density of the electrons in the tube is mvρ/e, where m is the electron mass, ρ is the
linear charge density and v is the velocity of the electrons. But ρv equals the current I in the
tube. The current I must be the same all along the tube. (If it were not, charge would build up
somewhere in the tube; but the charge density everywhere is constant in time, by assumption.)
Since ρv is the same all along the tube, so is the magnitude of the momentum density. Hence
the total mechanical momentum of the particles vanishes.
As Einstein remarked, God is subtle but not malicious. Our simple calculation was too
simple: we used the nonrelativistic formula for mechanical momentum, yet the momentum
3This conclusion holds only if the line of charge is straight. By contrast, even a kinky solenoid exerts no force on
a passing electron.

13.4
The Aharonov–Casher Effect
187
in the electromagnetic ﬁeld vanishes in the limit c →∞. Let us try the relativistic formula.
The current I = ρv is still the same all along the tube, but now the momentum density is not
mvρ/e. The momentum p of each particle is related to its energy E according to the equation
p = E
c2 v .
Hence the momentum density of the particles is equal to Evρ/c2e; and E, unlike ρv, is not
constant all along the tube. The total mechanical momentum of the particles does not vanish!
As a test of this resolution of the paradox, we roughly calculate the mechanical momentum
and the momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. (For an exact calculation, see Prob. 13.9.)
Suppose that the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the solenoid are constant and that the
solenoid cross section is a square of area L2. Let N denote the number of current loops in
the solenoid, and V the volume of the solenoid. The magnitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
momentum is
Pfield = |E||B|V/4πc ,
(13.13)
where the magnetic ﬁeld strength |B| equals
|B| = 4πINL2/V c .
(13.14)
Combining Eqs (13.13–14), we obtain IL2|E|N/c2 for the momentum in the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. On the other hand, each electron in the solenoid has e|E|L more energy when it moves
along the inner side (inner radius) of the solenoid than when it moves along the outer side
(outer radius). Hence from the outer side of the solenoid to the inner side, its momentum
increases by ev|E|L/c2. The density of particles in each tube is ρ/e, and there are N tubes in
the solenoid, so the magnitude of the mechanical momentum is IL2|E|N/c2, which coincides
with the magnitude of the electromagnetic momentum. The momenta have opposite signs,
however, and sum to zero.
So there is hidden mechanical momentum in the charged gas. Likewise, there is hidden
mechanical momentum in the rotating charged cylinders of Sect. 13.1. (See Prob. 13.11.) For
a current loop in a conductor the resolution differs qualitatively (since a conductor screens the
electric ﬁeld of an external charge) but not quantitatively [?]. As regards a magnetic dipole we
can summarize the resolution as follows: the force on a magnetic dipole µ at rest in ﬁelds E
and B is
F = ∇(µ · B) −1
c
d
dt(µ × E) .
(13.15)
For any model of a magnetic dipole involving current loops (but no magnetic monopoles),
Eq. (13.15) – and not Eq. (13.12) – is correct, in general. Equation (13.15) assumes that E and
B are constant over the magnetic dipole, i.e. that the magnetic dipole is small. In Eq. (13.15),
the term −µ × E/c represents the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum arising from the magnetic
dipole and the ﬁeld E. (See Prob. 13.13.) For a magnetic dipole moving past a line of charge,
with µ parallel to the line of charge, the two terms in Eq. (13.15) cancel, so the force on the
dipole vanishes. (See Prob. 13.14.) Hence the Aharonov–Casher effect is indeed dual to the
Aharonov–Bohm effect [7].

in the electromagnetic ﬁeld vanishes. However (if the tube is not a superconductor)
the current in the tube quickly decays, inducing a circulating electric ﬁeld that acts
on the line of charge. The line of charge acquires momentum. What happened to

Show that the force F in Eq. (13.15) vanishes.

not Eq. (13.15)) implies that the current loop feels a force ∇(µ · B′) in its rest frame.
Such a force, if it existed, could account for the Aharonov–Casher effect [8]. Assume
this force exists and show how to violate energy conservation by placing reﬂectors in
the path of the current loop.

14 Quantum Measurements and Relativity
Previous chapters discuss nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Is there a relativistic quantum
mechanics? In this chapter we assume that there is – and arrive at a paradox. The para-
dox concerns Lorentz transformations of quantum measurements. At the end of a quantum
measurement, an entangled state of the measured system and measuring device collapses to a
product state, according to von Neumann. (See Chap. 9.) The collapse is not Lorentz invariant,
so we try to make it Lorentz invariant. The paradox is that there seems to be no way to make
collapse Lorentz invariant.
The paradox concerns the collapse, not the correlations, of entangled states. If Alice and
Bob make local measurements, their results are Lorentz invariant, and the correlations in their
results are Lorentz invariant, as well. Bell’s inequality and Eq. (3.12) do not depend on how we
resolve the paradox of Sect. 14.1; nonlocal quantum correlations are nonlocal in any inertial
reference frame.
14.1
Collapse and Relativity
In 1927, at the ﬁfth Solvay congress, Einstein presented “a very simple objection to the prob-
ability interpretation” of quantum mechanics [1]. Consider a beam of electrons incident on
a screen with a single slit. Some of the electrons pass through the slit and form a diffraction
pattern on a photographic plate on the other side. According to quantum mechanics, the state
of the electrons approaching the photographic plate is an extended object, and the probabil-
ity density for an electron to hit varies smoothly over the plate. Once the electron hits the
plate, however, the probability for the electron to hit anywhere else on the plate drops to zero.
Apparently, then, the state changes instantaneously when the electron hits the plate. But the
instantaneous collapse of an extended object is incompatible with relativity. So how can the
electron state collapse instantaneously?
Similarly, suppose we measure the momentum of a particle very carefully, taking as much
time as we need for the measurement. By the end of the measurement, the particle is in a
momentum eigenstate. At time t = 0 we turn on a particle detector at the origin and ﬁnd
the particle there. According to von Neumann’s collapse postulate, the state of the particle
changes instantaneously, along the t = 0 hyperplane, from a momentum eigenstate to a position
eigenstate. (See Fig. 14.1 and Sect. 9.1.) The problem is that collapse along the t = 0
hyperplane will not be instantaneous for observers in other frames. Thus Fig. 14.2, the Lorentz
transformation of Fig. 14.1, makes no sense: the detector has found the particle at the origin,
yet the wave function of the particle does not vanish everywhere else.

ment.
Indeed, even Fig. 14.1 makes no sense. For according to Fig. 14.1, the wave function of
the particle did not vanish anywhere until t = 0. But since the particle cannot move faster than
light, it could not have been outside the past light cone of its detection at the origin at t = 0; the
wave function should vanish outside the past light cone. Could collapse perhaps occur along
the past light cone, as in Fig. 14.3? Collapse along the past light cone [2] would be Lorentz
invariant because light cones are Lorentz invariant. But for t < 0, Fig. 14.3 is not compatible
with any momentum eigenstate.
Another version of this paradox involves two distinguishable particles in an entangled state,
the singlet state |Ψ−⟩:
|Ψ−⟩=
1
√
2 (| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩) .
(14.1)
(In Eq. (14.1), as in Eqs. (3.5–6), we let the order of the states in each tensor product index
the particles.) Equation (14.1) represents only the spin states of the particles, not their spatial
wave functions, but we assume that the two particles are localized to regions that are far from
each other. Figure 14.4 shows the spacetime history of the two particles. They emerge from
O in the entangled state |Ψ−⟩and ﬂy off at nearly the speed of light in opposite directions.

One particle reaches Alice, who (at a) measures its spin component along some axis, and the
other particle reaches Bob, who (at b) measures its spin component along a (possibly different)
axis. Alice’s measurement is spacelike separated from Bob’s. In Fig. 14.4, a is earlier than
b, so by the time Bob makes a measurement, his particle is no longer entangled with Alice’s;
from the result of her measurement, Alice can anticipate the spin state of Bob’s particle. So
according to Fig 14.4, Alice’s measurement collapses the entangled state of the two particles.
But to an observer in another inertial reference frame, Bob’s measurement could come earlier.
Figure 14.5 shows the spacetime diagram for such an observer; the same events appear, but in
Fig. 14.5, b precedes a. For this observer, Bob’s measurement – not Alice’s – collapses the
entangled state. The two observers cannot agree on who collapsed the state. Even if we assume
that collapse occurs along the past light cone of a measurement, we cannot say whether it was
Alice’s or Bob’s measurement.
Let us ﬁx a and put b at any point spacelike separated from a. In Fig. 14.5, b precedes
a, but the time order of a and b is relative since their separation is spacelike. As long as b is
outside the past light cone of a, there is always a frame in which a precedes b. There is a frame
in which Alice has already measured when Bob makes his measurements. Thus the collapse
cannot occur outside the past light cone of a. Hence it cannot occur outside the past light cone
of b either. It seems that collapse has not occurred only in the intersection of the past light
cones of a and b. Perhaps, then, collapse occurs on the (Lorentz invariant) boundary of this
intersection. (See Fig. 14.6.) If so, then the particles are in a product state when Alice and
Bob make their measurements. But now suppose many pairs of particles emerge from O in
the state |Ψ−⟩. As in Fig. 14.4, one particle in each pair goes to Alice, the other to Bob. At

a, Alice measures the spin components of all her particles, along various axes. Bob does the
same with his particles at b. If the pairs of particles are in a product state when they reach a and
b, the correlations in these measurements must be local, i.e. they must satisfy Bell’s inequality.
(See Sect. 3.4.) But the quantum correlations of |Ψ−⟩do not satisfy Bell’s inequality. So the
particles cannot be in a product state when Alice and Bob make their measurements.
14.2
Relativistic Constraints on Measurements
In 1931, Landau and Peierls [3] claimed that the theory of relativity imposes constraints on
quantum measurements, beyond the constraints of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations.1 They
based their claim on a paradox. Suppose that at an initial time t < 0, we localize a particle
in a small region of space; then at t = 0, we measure its momentum. Our measurement
leaves the particle in some eigenstate of momentum. For any eigenstate of momentum, the
probability density in space is uniform. So – whatever the result of our measurement – if we
look for the particle again at any time t > 0, we may ﬁnd it anywhere. We may ﬁnd it at a
spacelike separation from its initial position. Thus quantum mechanics contradicts relativity
theory. Landau and Peierls resolved this paradox by claiming that a measurement of momentum
cannot be instantaneous: a momentum measurement of accuracy ∆p cannot take time less than
∆t, where ∆t satisﬁes a relativistic uncertainty relation
∆p∆t ≥ℏ/c .
(14.2)
Equation (14.2) follows from Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation ∆p∆x ≥ℏif we assume
∆x ≤c∆t. More generally, Landau and Peierls claimed that a measurement of any nonlocal
operator on a system cannot be instantaneous.
Let us apply their claim to a measurement of the total spin of two localized spin-1/2 particles
that are remote from one another [4]. As before, our friends Alice and Bob help us with the
measurement. Alice and Bob have prepared two spin-1/2 particles in the spin state
|Ψαβ⟩= α| ↑↓⟩+ β| ↓↑⟩,
(14.3)
with |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Alice and Bob each take one of the particles; in the tensor products
of Eq. (14.3), the ﬁrst spin state refers to Alice’s particle and the second to Bob’s. Let S(A)
and S(B) represent the spins of Alice’s and Bob’s particles, respectively. Let us assume that
1They also claimed that a measurement of the electric ﬁeld cannot be impulsive. See Chap. 8.

14.2
Relativistic Constraints on Measurements
197
Alice and Bob can measure the operator S2 on |Ψαβ⟩, where S = S(A) + S(B), and that their
measurements are impulsive and simultaneous (in some inertial reference frame). According
to the claim of Landau and Peierls, such a measurement contradicts relativistic causality. Does
it?
In general, |Ψαβ⟩is not an eigenstate of S2, but |Ψαβ⟩can be written as a sum of eigenstates
of S2:
|Ψαβ⟩= α + β
√
2 |2, 0⟩+ α −β
√
2 |0, 0⟩,
where
|2, 0⟩≡
1
√
2 (| ↑↓⟩+ | ↓↑⟩)
is the eigenstate of S2 with S2 = 2ℏ2 and Sz ≡S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
= 0, and
|0, 0⟩≡
1
√
2 (| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩)
is the eigenstate of S2 with S2 = 0 = Sz. Thus a measurement of S2 on |Ψαβ⟩must yield
2ℏ2 with probability |α + β|2/2 and 0 with probability |α −β|2/2.
A special case of |Ψαβ⟩is the state | ↑↓⟩, i.e. β = 0. Suppose that the two systems are
initially in the state | ↑↓⟩, and consider two possible sequences of measurements on this state.
In one sequence, Alice and Bob measure S2 on the particles at time t1. The initial state is a
superposition of eigenstates of S2
| ↑↓⟩=
1
√
2(|2, 0⟩+ |0, 0⟩) .
A measurement of S2 must leave the particles either in the state |2, 0⟩or in the state |0, 0⟩, with
equal probability. Now at a time t2 > t1 Alice measures the operator S(A)
z
on her system. No
matter what the result of the S2 measurement, there is an equal probability for Alice to ﬁnd
S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 and S(A)
z
= −ℏ/2.
The second sequence of measurements is the same as the ﬁrst, except that just before t1
– just before the measurement of S2 – Bob ﬂips the spin of his particle from | ↓⟩B to | ↑⟩B.
(The subscript B refers to Bob.) He thereby changes the state of the two particles from | ↑↓⟩
to | ↑↑⟩. The state | ↑↑⟩is an eigenstate |2, 1⟩of S2 with eigenvalue 2ℏ2 and of Sz with
eigenvalue ℏ. The measurement of S2 at t = t1 therefore yields 2ℏ2. As in the sequence
above, at t2 > t1 Alice measures the operator S(A)
z
on her particle. But now Alice obtains
the result S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 with certainty! She is certain to obtain S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 just because Bob
ﬂipped the spin of his particle before t1. By assumption, the time interval from t1 to t2 can be
arbitrarily short (since the S2 measurement is impulsive). Thus Bob’s local measurement can
affect the result of Alice’s measurement over a spacelike distance, in violation of relativistic
causality. Bob could transmit a superluminal signal to Alice if they repeated the experiment on
many pairs of spin. If Bob ﬂips none of his spins, Alice obtains S(A)
z
= −ℏ/2 and S(A)
z
= ℏ/2
with equal probability; if Bob ﬂips all his spins, Alice obtains S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 only.

Quantum Measurements and Relativity
We arrive at this violation of relativistic causality by assuming that a measurement of S2
on the state | ↑↓⟩could be practically instantaneous. So Landau and Peierls were right when
they claimed that an instantaneous measurement of certain nonlocal operators would violate
relativistic causality. However, we have not shown that the instantaneous measurement of every
nonlocal operator on every state would violate relativistic causality. Let us consider a more
general measurement. We return to the entangled state |Ψαβ⟩in Eq. (14.3) – without assuming
β = 0 – and apply the two measurement sequences to this state. In the ﬁrst sequence, Alice
and Bob measure S2 and then Alice measures S(A)
z
on her particle. The outcome of the S2
measurement leaves the particles either in the state |0, 0⟩or in the state |2, 0⟩. In either |0, 0⟩
or |2, 0⟩, the results S(A)
z
= ±ℏ/2 for Alice’s measurement are equally likely. The second
sequence is the same as the ﬁrst, except that Bob ﬁrst ﬂips the spin of his particle. He thereby
changes the state from |Ψαβ⟩to
|Ψ′
αβ⟩= α| ↑↑⟩+ β| ↓↓⟩,
and |Ψ′
αβ⟩is an eigenstate of S2 with eigenvalue 2ℏ2. Hence the S2 measurement does not
change the state of the two particles. Now if Alice measures S(A)
z
on her particle, the probability
of the result S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 is |α|2 while the probability of the result S(A)
z
= −ℏ/2 is |β|2. So if
|α|2 ̸= |β|2, such sequences of measurements would allow Alice and Bob to violate causality.
This analysis shows that an instantaneous measurement of S2 on any state |Ψαβ⟩with
|α|2 ̸= |β|2 would be incompatible with relativistic causality. While it supports the general
claim of Landau and Peierls, it also suggests a loophole: perhaps a measurement of S2 on
|Ψαβ⟩could be instantaneous, only in the case |α|2 = |β|2. The next section shows that this
suggestion is correct.
14.3
Nonlocal Measurements
In this section we encounter a new kind of measurement. We will see how Alice and Bob
can verify that their spin-1/2 particles are in the singlet state |0, 0⟩, with an instantaneous
measurement [5]. The state |0, 0⟩is the eigenstate of S2 with eigenvalue 0, so we will see
how Alice and Bob can measure S2 on this state, although – as the last section shows – they
cannot measure S2 on the state | ↑↓⟩. Thus Alice and Bob ﬁnd themselves verifying a state
instead of measuring an operator; unlike nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which allows
an instantaneous measurement of any observable on any state, relativistic causality allows an
instantaneous measurement of S2 on some states but not on others!
To construct a quantum measurement that veriﬁes S2 = 0, we apply the formalism of
Chap. 7. The ﬁrst step in the construction is to show that Alice and Bob can measure Sz
without measuring either S(A)
z
or S(B)
z
. They do so with a Hamiltonian

(14.4)
after preparing their measuring devices in a state with

(14.5)

14.3
Nonlocal Measurements
199
Here QA
z and QB
z represent the positions of pointers on the measuring devices of Alice and Bob,
respectively; P A
z and P B
z are conjugate to QA
z and QB
z , respectively. The coupling g(t) is zero
except during the interval 0 ≤t ≤T, when g(t) = 1/T; we assume that T approaches 0, so the
measurement is impulsive. The twist in this measurement is that Alice and Bob prepare their
measuring devices in an entangled state, Eq. (14.5); it is, in fact, the entangled state of Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen. (See Sect. 3.1.) Now applying the Heisenberg equations of motion, we
ﬁnd that P A
z and P B
z do not change during the measurement, while QA
z + QB
z changes from
0 to the value S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
. So Alice and Bob have measured Sz on their entangled state. But
they have not measured S(A)
z
or S(B)
z
, because neither QA
z nor QB
z is deﬁned initially.
How much time does this procedure take? It takes some time to prepare the measuring
devices in the state of Eq. (14.5) and to bring them to where Alice and Bob use them. After
the impulsive measurement, it again takes some time for Alice and Bob to meet and compare
their results (the ﬁnal values QA
z (T) and QB
z (T) that they have recorded in their notebooks).
But the interaction between the measuring device and the entangled particles is impulsive; the
measurement is instantaneous, because it ﬁxes the result immediately. Alice and Bob read the
result only later, but the measurement is over when the interaction is over. Thus – contrary to
the claim of Landau and Peierls – there can indeed be instantaneous measurements of nonlocal
properties.
Now the state |0, 0⟩is the unique state for which the operators Sx, Sy and Sz all vanish.
Thus, if Alice and Bob measure these three operators on a pair of particles and obtain 0 for all
three, they have veriﬁed that the state is |0, 0⟩. Such a measurement is plausible, because Alice
and Bob can measure Sx, Sy and Sz separately and instantaneously, as we have just seen. An
interaction Hamiltonian that includes these three measurements is

Thus the procedure for verifying the entangled state |0, 0⟩is the following: at a time
t = 0 the measuring devices, in the entangled state of Eq. (14.7), are ready and in place in
the laboratories of Alice and Bob. Between times t = 0 and t = T, the coupling g(t) and
the Hamiltonian Hint of Eq. (14.6) are nonzero. At time t = T the interaction is complete,
and Alice and Bob check and record the pointer positions on their measuring devices. It still
takes them time to compare their records, but the measurement is complete. If Alice and Bob
obtain QA

x = QA
y + QB
y = QA
y + QB
y = 0 after the measurement, they have veriﬁed
that Sx = Sy = Sz = S2 = 0.
14.4
Which Nonlocal Operators are Measurable?
The difference between local and nonlocal measurements of S2 is striking. If Alice and Bob
bring their particles together into one laboratory, they can measure the operator S2 on any spin
state; we can call their measurement an operator-speciﬁc measurement. By contrast, when
Alice and Bob (with their respective laboratories and particles) are far from each other, they
can at best verify eigenstates of S2. The previous section shows how Alice and Bob can verify
the state |0, 0⟩, in what we can call a state-speciﬁc measurement; a modiﬁcation of this mea-
surement would allow them to verify the state |2, 0⟩. They could also verify the states |2, 1⟩
and |2, −1⟩by local measurements of S(A)
z
and S(B)
z
, but these local measurements are incom-
patible with nonlocal measurements to verify |0, 0⟩and |2, 0⟩. Thus Alice and Bob can verify
any eigenstate of S2, yet they cannot measure S2 in an instantaneous operator-speciﬁc mea-
surement. The distinction between operator-speciﬁc and state-speciﬁc measurements arises
only when we consider relativistic causality.
Now we ask, is there any nonlocal operator – any operator with entangled eigenstates – that
relativistic causality allows Alice and Bob to measure instantaneously? This section shows
that almost any such measurement would contradict relativistic causality. But (like Sect. 14.2)
it suggests a loophole; and as the next section shows, relativistic causality does allow Alice
and Bob to measure at least one nonlocal operator instantaneously [6].
As before, we consider spin operators. Consider pairs of distinguishable spin-1/2 particles,
with one particle of each pair in Alice’s laboratory and the other in Bob’s laboratory. Let W
be a nondegenerate operator on the Hilbert space of the two spins, and let W have, as one of

14.4
Which Nonlocal Operators are Measurable?
201
its eigenstates, the spin state |Ψαβ⟩of Eq. (14.3):
|Ψαβ⟩= α| ↑↓⟩+ β| ↓↑⟩.
For simplicity, we take α and β real. Can Alice and Bob instantaneously measure W on their
spins? Let us suppose they can. Assume that Alice and Bob can measure W by means of
measuring devices that interact impulsively (and locally) with the spins, such that if the spins are
in the initial state |Ψαβ⟩, the measuring devices verify this state without changing it, and record
the result; if the initial state of the spins is orthogonal to |Ψαβ⟩, the measuring devices record
a different result, and leave the spins in an eigenstate orthogonal to |Ψαβ⟩. (This assumption
holds for quantum measurements of any local observable.) The operator W has three additional
eigenstates, which we denote |W1⟩, |W2⟩, |W3⟩. They span the subspace orthogonal to |Ψαβ⟩.
We need not deﬁne |W1⟩, |W2⟩and |W3⟩, but we deﬁne three orthonormal vectors that span
the same subspace: they are |Ψ⊥
αβ⟩, | ↑↑⟩and | ↓↓⟩, with
|Ψ⊥
αβ⟩= β| ↑↓⟩−α| ↓↑⟩.
Now Alice and Bob try the following experiment. First, they prepare an ensemble of pairs
in the singlet state |0, 0⟩:
|0, 0⟩=
1
√
2 [| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩]
= α −β
√
2 |Ψαβ⟩+ α + β
√
2 |Ψ⊥
αβ⟩.
Second, they measure W instantaneously on each pair of spins. With probability (α−β)2/2 =
(1 −2αβ)/2, their measuring devices record a result corresponding to the state |Ψαβ⟩, and
leave the pair of spins in the state |Ψαβ⟩. However, the measuring devices may record a result
corresponding to another eigenstate |Wi⟩, and leave the pair of spins in the state |Wi⟩. The
probability of this result is

Finally, Alice measures S(A)
z
and Bob measures S(B)
z
.
What is the probability that Alice obtains S(A)
z
= ℏ/2? If the pair is in the state |Ψαβ⟩,
the probability is |⟨Ψαβ| ↑⟩A|2 = α2, where | ↑⟩A represents the state of Alice’s spin with
S(A)
z
= ℏ/2. What if the pair is in the state |Wi⟩? Then the probability that Alice obtains
S(A)
z
= ℏ/2 is |⟨Wi| ↑⟩A|2. Since
⟨Wi| = ⟨Wi| ↑↑⟩⟨↑↑| + ⟨Wi| ↓↓⟩⟨↓↓| + ⟨Wi|Ψ⊥

we have
|⟨Wi| ↑⟩A|2 = |⟨Wi| ↑↑⟩|2|⟨↑↑| ↑⟩A|2 + |⟨Wi|Ψ⊥

= |⟨Wi| ↑↑⟩|2 + |⟨Wi|Ψ⊥

Thus, the probability P(↑A) that Alice obtains S(A)

(14.11)
Here relativistic causality imposes a constraint. After Alice and Bob prepare the ensemble
of pairs in the state |0, 0⟩but before they measure W, either Alice or Bob could change the state
of the pairs from |0, 0⟩to |2, 0⟩. For example, by brieﬂy subjecting her spins to a magnetic
ﬁeld in the z-direction, Alice could change the relative phase between the terms | ↑↓⟩and | ↓↑⟩
in |0, 0⟩as she likes, in an arbitrarily short time. So could Bob. These actions belong to a
general class of local operations, local unitary transformations. Local unitary transformations
are unitary transformations that apply only to Alice’s system or only to Bob’s (or products of
these). If Alice can affect P(↑B) or Bob can affect P(↑A) by such local actions, one can send a
superluminal signal to the other. So relativistic causality implies that if Alice and Bob prepare
their spins in the state |2, 0⟩,
|2, 0⟩=

(14.12)
Equating P(↑A) −P(↑B) across Eqs. (14.10–11) and Eq. (14.12), we ﬁnd that αβ = 0 or
α = ±β.
This conclusion holds for any nondegenerate operator W, on the Hilbert space of the two
spins, having |Ψαβ⟩as an eigenstate. But actually, local unitary transformations can reduce
any state in the Hilbert space of the two spins to the state |Ψαβ⟩for some α and β real. (See

14.5
Measuring a Nonlocal Operator
203
Prob. 14.4.) Just as Alice and Bob can change a relative phase by local actions, Alice can ﬂip
or rotate her spin (without knowing what it is), or Bob can ﬂip his; these actions, too, are local
unitary transformations. If Alice and Bob share a pair of spins in any state, they can reduce the
state to the form |Ψαβ⟩by local unitary operations. They cannot, however, change |α| and |β|.
Thus relativistic causality imposes the following condition: Alice and Bob cannot measure
W instantaneously unless each eigenstate of W equals |Ψαβ⟩– for some α and β satisfying
αβ = 0 or |α| = |β| – up to local unitary transformations.
This condition is necessary but not sufﬁcient; S2 satisﬁes it, yet Alice and Bob cannot
measure S2 (or any nondegenerate operator with the same eigenstates) instantaneously. Does
W exist?
14.5
Measuring a Nonlocal Operator
Can Alice and Bob measure even one nonlocal operator instantaneously? Actually, they can.
To show how they can, we ﬁrst consider a variation of the nonlocal measurements of Sect. 14.3.
Suppose Alice and Bob share a pair of spin-1/2 particles and wish to determine not S(A)
z
+
S(B)
z
but [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏ. If the state of their spins is | ↑↑⟩or | ↓↓⟩, they can simply
measure S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
to determine (S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
) mod 2ℏ. But what if the state of their spins is
(| ↑↑⟩+| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2? This state is an eigenstate of [S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏbut not of S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
.
Alice and Bob cannot determine [S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏby measuring S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
. They have
to measure [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏdirectly. Can they?
Indeed, Alice and Bob can measure [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏand S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
with the same
Hamiltonian, Hint, of Eq. (14.4). But the initial (entangled) state of their measuring devices
must be different. To measure S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
, Alice and Bob prepare their measuring devices in
the state QA
z + QB
z = 0. (Here, as in Sect. 14.3, QA
z and QB
z represent pointer positions, P A
z
and P B
z their respective conjugate momenta.) To measure [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏ, Alice and
Bob must prepare their measuring devices in the state QA
z +QB
z = 0 mod 2ℏ. As in Sect. 14.3,
Hint evolves QA
z (0) + QB
z (0) to
QA
z (T) + QB
z (T) = QA
z (0) + QB
z (0) + S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
,
but now a ﬁnal measurement of QA
z (T) + QB
z (T) ﬁxes S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
only up to a multiple of
2ℏ, so Alice and Bob have measured [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏbut not S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
.
How does this measurement affect the eigenstates of [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏ? We want
a measurement of [S(A)
z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏon one of its eigenstates to leave the eigenstate
unchanged (up to an overall phase). Since

So the requirement that the measurement not change the eigenstates implies

i.e. P A
z and P B
z must be multiples of π and P A

is compatible with the assumption QA

z = 0 mod 2ℏ, hence Alice and Bob can measure

z
+ S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏinstantaneously. (See Prob. 14.6.)
Now consider an operator W with eigenstates |0, 0⟩, |2, 0⟩, (| ↑↑⟩+ | ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 and (| ↑↑⟩
−| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2. Alice and Bob can measure W instantaneously in four steps. In the ﬁrst step,
Alice and Bob measure [S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏon their spins. This measurement distinguishes
|0, 0⟩and |2, 0⟩, on the one hand, from (| ↑↑⟩+| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 and (| ↑↑⟩−| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2, on the other.
Next, they must distinguish |0, 0⟩from |2, 0⟩or (| ↑↑⟩+ | ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 from (| ↑↑⟩−| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2.
To do so, Alice rotates her spin as follows:
| ↑⟩A →(| ↑⟩A −| ↓⟩A)/
√
2 ,
| ↓⟩A →(| ↑⟩A + | ↓⟩A)/
√
2 .
(14.13)
Bob does the same to his spin. Equation (14.13) deﬁnes a local unitary operation. By applying
Eq. (14.13) to their respective spins, Alice and Bob interchange |2, 0⟩and (| ↑↑⟩−| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2
while leaving |0, 0⟩and (| ↑↑⟩+| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 unchanged. In the third step, Alice and Bob measure
[S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏagain. From the results of the two [S(A)
z
+S(B)
z
] mod 2ℏmeasurements
they can positively identify each of the four eigenstates |0, 0⟩, |2, 0⟩, (| ↑↑⟩+ | ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 and
(| ↑↑⟩−| ↓↓⟩)/
√
2 of W. Finally, Alice and Bob apply the inverse of Eq. (14.13) so that the
measurement of W returns the spins to their initial state.
Indeed, W is a nonlocal operator that Alice and Bob can measure. Each eigenstate of W is
equivalent (up to local unitary transformations) to |Ψαβ⟩with α = ±β; we say it is maximally
entangled [7]. What about an operator with an eigenstate that is not entangled (αβ = 0)?
Can Alice and Bob instantaneously measure such an operator? A nonlocal operator must have
αβ ̸= 0 for at least one eigenstate. So consider an operator having at least one maximally
entangled eigenstate and at least one product eigenstate. We can take these two eigenstates to
be2 | ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩/
√
2 and | ↑↑⟩. Could Alice and Bob instantaneously measure an operator
with these two states as eigenstates? If they could, they could also do the following. Let Alice
and Bob prepare their spins in the state | ↑↑⟩. Next, they measure the operator instantaneously.
Finally, Alice measures σz on her spin. She is certain to obtain σz = 1. But what if, just before
they measure the nonlocal operator, Bob ﬂips his spin? He changes the initial state from | ↑↑⟩
to | ↑↓⟩, and now the measurement of the nonlocal operator has a chance of leaving the spins
in the state (| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩)/
√
2 and Alice has a chance of obtaining −1 when she measures σz
on her spin. If so, Bob could send a superluminal signal to Alice. We conclude that Alice and
Bob cannot measure such an operator instantaneously.
To summarize, Alice and Bob can measure W instantaneously (although they cannot obtain
the result of their measurement instantaneously). However, W is essentially the only nonde-
generate nonlocal operator that Alice and Bob can measure instantaneously on their two spins.
2First, any maximally entangled spin state of the two particles is equivalent, up to local unitary transformations,local
unitary transformations to the singlet state |0, 0⟩= (| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩)/
√
2. (See Prob. 14.4.) Second, the singlet state is
invariant under any overall rotation – a rotation of Alice’s spin, and the same rotation of Bob’s spin – hence Alice and
Bob can bring the product eigenstate to the form | ↑↑′⟩where | ↑′⟩B represents Bob’s spin polarized along some axis,
not necessarily the same as Alice’s z-axis. But nondegenerate eigenstates must be orthogonal. Hence | ↑′⟩B = | ↑⟩B.

Collapse and Relativity Revisited
205
That is, Alice and Bob can measure only those operators related to W by local unitary trans-
formations. To measure any such operator – any nondegenerate operator with four maximally
entangled eigenstates – they can apply the local unitary transformations that transform it to W,
measure W, and then apply the inverse transformations. The proof that suitable local unitary
transformations exist, for every such operator, is Prob. 14.8.
14.6
Collapse and Relativity Revisited
The paradoxes of Sect. 14.1 suggest that there is no Lorentz invariant account of collapse, and
the nonlocal measurements of Sects. 14.2–14.5 reinforce this suggestion. Suppose Alice and
Bob prepare a pair of distinguishable spin-1/2 particles in the entangled state |0, 0⟩. Each has
a particle and, at time t = 0, measures its spin along some axis. Figure 14.7 shows Alice’s
measurement at a and Bob’s measurement at b. In addition, before a and b, at time t = −ϵ,
Alice and Bob verify that the state of the spins is |0, 0⟩. For the veriﬁcation measurement,
Alice has a device that interacts with her spin at aV and Bob has a device that interacts with
his spin at bV . Since the veriﬁcation is instantaneous, ϵ can be arbitrarily small. (Alice and
Bob could even verify the state |0, 0⟩many times before t = 0, but in Fig. 14.7 there is just
one veriﬁcation measurement.) So, without a doubt, the state of the spins up to t = 0 is |0, 0⟩;
and without a doubt, after t = 0, the spins are in a product state. Thus, Alice and Bob directly
verify that the collapse of |0, 0⟩occurs on the t = 0 hyperplane, as the von Neumann collapse
postulate assumes. But then collapse is not Lorentz invariant.
Thus observers in different frames disagree about collapse. Their disagreement, however,
is not a contradiction. It would be a contradiction only if observers in different frames could
verify incompatible accounts of collapse; but they cannot. Figure 14.8 illustrates this point.
Alice and Bob verify the state |0, 0⟩at aV and bV ; in the frame of Figs. 14.7–8, aV and bV
are simultaneous. Then at a, Alice measures the spin of her particle along some axis.3 Now
suppose two more observers, Alex and Barb, decide to verify the state |0, 0⟩on the same pair
of particles. Alex has a device that interacts with his particle (which is also Alice’s particle) at
a′
V , and Barb has a device that interacts with her particle (which is also Bob’s particle) at b′
V .
Then at b′, Barb measures the spin of her particle along some axis. But Alex and Barb cannot
verify the state |0, 0⟩because the events aV and bV disturb the state of the spins. Likewise,
Alice and Bob cannot verify the state |0, 0⟩because, following the event a′
V , the spins are no

Figure 14.7: Alice and Bob verify the state |0, 0⟩
at time t = −ϵ and immediately afterwards, at
t = 0, collapse the state with local measurements.
3How does the sequence of events look in another frame? In another frame, the veriﬁcation of the entangled state
|0, 0⟩is not instantaneous. Since aV and bV are not simultaneous, the veriﬁcation of |0, 0⟩starts with one of the
events aV , bV and continues until the other.

longer in this state. The two state-speciﬁc measurements disturb one another. If they did not
disturb one another, Alice and Bob could verify that collapse occurs just after aV and bV , and
Alex and Barb could verify that collapse occurs just after a′
V and b′
V . But they disturb each
other, saving us from this contradiction.
Indeed, observers in different frames disagree not only about collapse. They also disagree
about temporal order, length, energy, and all other physical quantities that are covariant but
not invariant. The paradoxes of Sect. 14.1 prove only that collapse is not Lorentz invariant.
In a Lorentz covariant collapse, observers in different frames could have different accounts
of collapse. In any frame, each passing moment deﬁnes an equal-time hyperplane. If we
reconsider the events in Figs. 14.4–6 we observe that, relative to any given frame, the singlet
state |Ψ−⟩always collapses on an equal-time hyperplane of that frame, i.e. on the equal-time
hyperplane4 that contains either a or b (whichever event is earliest). This observation is itself
a covariant statement about collapse [8]. There is even a concrete model that corresponds to
this statement of covariant collapse: it is the relativistic CSL model [9]. (See Sect. 9.2.) The
classical ﬁeld w(x, t) in the CSL model transforms as a Lorentz scalar (just as the probability
of any measurement result is a Lorentz scalar), and the evolution equation for the state vector
|ψw(t)⟩(a generalization of Eq. (9.10)) insures that collapse happens almost instantaneously,
for a large enough measuring device, on an equal-time hyperplane in a given inertial reference
frame. Covariant collapse resolves the paradoxes of Sect. 14.1.
All the same, relativity poses a problem for quantum measurements. We have seen that
relativistic causality forbids an instantaneous measurement of almost all nonlocal operators
and states.
Hence the Hermitian operators, and the states, of relativistic quantum theory
do not, in general, correspond to what experiments can measure. Ideally, a theory should
predict what experiments can measure, neither more nor less. Relativistic constraints spoil
the correspondence between quantum theory and what experiments can measure. This lack of
correspondence may account for some of the pathology of relativistic quantum theory.
4More generally, we can state that collapse happens separately on every spacelike hypersurface containing the
measurement event.

15 How to Observe a Quantum Wave
In 1926, Schr¨odinger postulated “material waves” in an analogy with light waves. Rays of
light – which obey the principle of least time – are an approximation to light waves. In
Schr¨odinger’s analogy, paths of material objects – which obey the principle of least action
– are an approximation to material waves. The paths of material objects are as ﬁctitious as
rays of light, while material waves are as real (and as measurable) as light waves [1]. But
within months, Born had discarded “the physical pictures of Schr¨odinger, which aim at a
revitalization of the classical continuum theory” [2], and given the “material wave” Ψ(x, t)
a new interpretation: |Ψ(x, t)|2 is the probability density to ﬁnd a particle at x at time t.
Born’s interpretation suggests that for a single object, Ψ(x, t) is not measurable – to measure
a probability density, we need to prepare Ψ(x, t) many times.
We claim, throughout this book, that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics corresponds com-
pletely with experiment (whenever we can treat the speed of light as inﬁnite). If so, what
corresponds to the quantum wave? That is, what corresponds to “the wave function of a single
electron” if no experiment on a single electron can measure Ψ(x, t) (or even |Ψ(x, t)|2)? Our
answer to this question would have surprised both Schr¨odinger and Born: experiments can
measure the wave function of a single electron! This chapter explains how (and in what sense)
“protective” measurements on a single electron yield both the norm and the relative phase
of Ψ(x, t).
Protective measurements belong to, and extend, nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Are
they consistent with relativistic causality? Two paradoxes in Sect. 15.1 hint that, in general,
quantum measurements are not consistent with relativistic causality. And in particular, how can
a measurement of Ψ(x, t) – an extended object that collapses instantaneously – be consistent
with relativistic causality? (See Sect. 14.1.)
15.1
Dipole Paradox
Einstein, in his debate with Bohr, used a version of the two-slit interference experiment to
argue that quantum mechanics is inconsistent. Bohr pointed out a ﬂaw in Einstein’s argument.
(See Sect. 2.4.) A more sophisticated version of Einstein’s argument, in Sect. 4.1, is ﬂawed, as
well; but let us now try a still more sophisticated version. Figure 15.1 shows the experiment.
Electrons in an eigenstate of momentum pass through a screen with two slits and strike a row of
detectors, which record an interference pattern. There is at most one electron in the apparatus
at a time – the time of ﬂight t0 of an electron through the apparatus is much less than the time T
between successive clicks of the detectors. Standing a distance L > ct0/2 from the apparatus

is a physicist, Prof. Nu, with a device for measuring electric ﬁeld strength. Nu stands closer
to the right slit than to the left slit. Thus her measuring device detects a stronger electric ﬁeld
if the electron passes through the right slit than if it passes through the left slit, and she can
check through which slit the electron passes.
In the other versions of the two-slit interference experiment, attempts to check which way
the electrons go spoil the interference pattern. But Nu’s measurements of the electric ﬁeld
cannot spoil the interference pattern. Consider one such measurement: At time t = 0, an
electron reaches the two slits. To ﬁnd out through which slit the electron passes, Nu measures
the electric ﬁeld at time t = L/c; she must wait that long for the ﬁeld of the electron passing
through the apparatus to reach her. Does Nu’s measurement of the electric ﬁeld affect the
electron? Whatever Nu does at time t = L/c cannot affect the electron before the time
t = 2L/c, according to relativistic causality. But by the time t = 2L/c > t0, the electron has
already reached the row of detectors and made one of them click, so Nu’s measurement cannot
possibly affect the detection of the electron.
We have treated Nu’s measurement as a single spacetime event. Can we? The answer
depends on her measuring device. If her measuring device is a large, charged sphere, as in
Sect. 8.4, then we cannot: the ﬁeld of the sphere might affect the two-slit apparatus long before
the electron passes through it. But suppose her measuring device is a collapsible dipole – two
equal and opposite charges that separate to form a dipole and then rejoin. At time t = L/c,
Nu opens the dipole, measures the electric ﬁeld via its effect on each charge, and closes the
dipole. Except for a short time around t = L/c, the measuring device is electrically neutral
and cannot affect the electron passing through the apparatus.
At time t = T, another electron passes through the apparatus. We can choose T large
enough such that any ﬁelds due to Nu’s ﬁrst measurement have dissipated. Once again, Nu
checks through which slit the electron passes, with no effect on the electron before its detection.
A third electron passes through at t = 2T, a fourth at t = 3T, and so on. After many electrons,
the detectors show a diffraction pattern. Yet Nu can tell us through which slit each electron
went, can’t she? Nu? Relativistic causality allows Nu to violate Bohr’s complementarity
principle.
Here is a related paradox, in which Prof. Nu violates Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations. At
time t = 0, a particle with charge Q is located somewhere inside Prof. Nu’s large laboratory.
Her students have just made very accurate measurements of the particle’s momentum, but all
they know about its position is that the particle is still somewhere in the laboratory. Nu herself

15.2

213
is standing a distance L from the laboratory, where she measures the local electric ﬁeld by
opening a dipole for a short time around t = L/c. From this measurement she infers the
particle’s position at t = 0. At time t = L/c she also receives a report from her students
regarding the particle’s momentum at t = 0. Nu’s position measurement can have no effect on
the particle until time t = 2L/c. Thus, during the time interval L/c < t < 2L/c, Nu knows
the position and momentum of the particle more accurately than the uncertainty relations allow.
How do we resolve these paradoxes? We may wonder whether we have treated the electric
ﬁeld correctly. Is it a classical or a quantum ﬁeld? We have to ask, because it is inconsistent to
couple a quantum particle to a classical electromagnetic ﬁeld. An electron passing through the
apparatus generates an electric ﬁeld. If this electric ﬁeld is classical, it cannot be in a quantum
superposition. But the electron passing the two slits is in a quantum superposition – it has a
nonzero amplitude to pass through each slit. If the electric ﬁeld coupled to the electron were
classical, it would instantly collapse the quantum superposition of the electron, and there could
be no interference pattern. So the electric ﬁeld, too, must be in a quantum superposition. It
must be a quantum ﬁeld. (See Sect. 8.4.) This argument applies to any ﬁeld coupled to the
electron, including the gravitational ﬁeld [3]. But does a quantum electric ﬁeld help us resolve
the paradoxes?
15.2
How not to Observe a Quantum Wave
Born’s probability interpretation of Ψ(x, t) suggests that Ψ(x, t) is measurable only if we
prepare it many times. We do not know that Ψ(x, t) is measurable only if we prepare it many
times; we only know that if we do prepare it many times, we can measure |Ψ(x, t)|2. However,
there are at least four good arguments why Ψ(x, t) is not measurable if we prepare it only once.
Let us review them.
The ﬁrst argument comes from experience. Born’s interpretation ﬁts what experiments
show us. Cathode rays leave tracks of tiny water droplets as they cross a Wilson cloud chamber –
straight tracks or (in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds) curved tracks. As Schr¨odinger [4] himself
put it many years later, “We cannot but interpret them as traces of the paths of single electrons”.
And although the quantum wave of an electron spreads out in space, we never see the electron
itself spread out in space; we never detect it in two or more places simultaneously.
Unitarity provides a second argument. Imagine a device that couples to a single electron
wave function Ψ(x, t) and, let us assume, measures |Ψ(x, t)|2. The device need not measure
|Ψ(x, t)|2 all over spacetime; let us assume only that it measures the wave function at x = 0,
t = 0. Suppose the device has a pointer that, at the beginning of the experiment, points to the
value 0 on a dial; at the end of the measurement, it points to the value |Ψ(0, 0)|2. If the wave
function of the electron is Ψ1(x, t), the pointer points to |Ψ1(0, 0)|2, while if the wave function
of the electron is Ψ2(x, t), the pointer points to |Ψ2(0, 0)|2. Now, these two states of the pointer
are orthogonal, but the wave functions Ψ1(x, t) and Ψ2(x, t) need not be orthogonal; and if
they are not orthogonal, the device violates unitarity – it transforms nonorthogonal states into
orthogonal states.
Indeed, linearity alone provides an argument. Suppose the device interacts with an electron
in a superposition [Ψ1(x, t) + Ψ2(x, t)] /
√
2. Linear time evolution would evolve the pointer
to a superposition of pointing to |Ψ1(0, 0)|2 and to |Ψ2(0, 0)|2. But if the quantum wave is

214
15
How to Observe a Quantum Wave
measurable, the pointer should not be in a superposition at the end of the measurement; it
should point to the value
1
2|Ψ1(0, 0) + Ψ2(0, 0)|2 ,
which is the probability density of the superposition [Ψ1(x, t) + Ψ2(x, t)] /
√
2 at x = 0,
t = 0. Thus, by assuming that an arbitrary quantum wave is measurable, we contradict the
linearity of quantum evolution.
The fourth argument comes from relativistic causality (and the paradoxes of Sect. 14.1).
Consider a quantum wave that extends over a macroscopic domain. For example, let our friends
Alice and Bob each have a box, and let them come together to prepare an electron in a quantum

√
2; here ΨA(x, t) is a normalized state with support
only in Alice’s box, and ΨB(x, t) is a normalized state with support only in Bob’s box. Alice
and Bob then go off in opposite directions, with their boxes, to a very great distance. Alice also
takes with her a device for measuring the quantum wave, while Bob takes with him a Geiger
counter. At time t = 0, Alice (at x = 0) measures the quantum wave (or the corresponding
probability density) inside her box. Just before t = 0 (in some reference frame) Bob may
switch on the Geiger counter and look for the electron in his box, or he may do nothing. If he
does nothing, Alice’s measurement will yield the value |ΨA(0, 0)|2/2. But if Bob chooses to
switch on the counter, he may ﬁnd the electron in his box, and then Alice’s measurement will
yield a zero result; or he may not ﬁnd the electron in his box, and then Alice’s measurement
will yield the result |ΨA(0, 0)|2 (assuming perfect efﬁciency for the Geiger counter). Either
way, Bob can send a message to Alice – and violate relativistic causality – by choosing whether
or not to look for the electron.
With such weighty arguments – unitarity, linearity, relativistic causality and decades of
experience – to show that Ψ(x, t) is not measurable, it would seem a waste of time to try to
show that it is. But that is what we do next. Only afterward – after showing that Ψ(x, t) is
measurable – do we look for loopholes in these four arguments.

Protective Measurements
Section 7.2 sets out the paradigm for a quantum measurement. We postulate a measurement
interaction
Hint(t) = g(t)AsPd ,
in which As is the measured observable; Pd is canonically conjugate to an observable Qd
representing the pointer position on the measuring device. The coupling g(t) is different from
zero only for times 0 ≤t ≤T and normalized according to
 T
0
g(t) dt = g0 .
Thus, the whole measurement lasts no longer than T. Often, it is convenient to take the
impulsive limit T →0. But let us consider the opposite limit, in which T is very large, and
g(t) is always near 0, changing slowly. What does the measurement yield in this limit?

15.3
Protective Measurements

Suppose that Hs (the Hamiltonian of the system when it is not measured) has discrete and
nondegenerate energy eigenvalues Ei, and the system is in one of the corresponding energy
eigenstates |Ψi⟩. If |Ψi⟩is in an eigenstate of As, the measurement (however long it takes)
yields the corresponding eigenvalue of As. If |Ψi⟩is not an eigenstate of As, let us treat Hint(t)
as a perturbation g0AsPd/T, lasting a time T, on Hs. To ﬁrst order [5] in 1/T, the state of the
system remains |Ψi⟩; the corresponding eigenvalue of Hs + Hint is Ei + ⟨Ψi|Hint|Ψi⟩. The
shift in the energy is ⟨Ψi|Hint|Ψi⟩and equals g0Pd/T times the expectation value ⟨Ψi|As|Ψi⟩.
So the pointer on the measuring device shifts by g0⟨Ψi|As|Ψi⟩during the measurement – a
measurement on a single system can yield an expectation value!
Can it? Let us apply the adiabatic theorem to the measurement. The combination Hs +
Hint(t) is the slowly changing Hamiltonian of the system; it depends on time only through the
small coupling g(t). Applying the formalism of Sect. 12.2, we obtain an effective Hamiltonian
Heff for the pointer of the measuring device:
Heff = Hs + g(t)Pd

i
ΠiAsΠi ,
where Πi = |Ψi⟩⟨Ψi| projects onto |Ψi⟩. (For simplicity, we take the Hamiltonian Hd of the
measuring device to vanish when there is no measurement.) The equation of motion for Qd is
d
dtQd = g(t)

i
ΠiAsΠi ,
which we integrate to obtain
Qd(T) −Qd(0) = g0

i
ΠiAsΠi .
If the system is in the i-th energy eigenstate, the change in the pointer reading is g0 times the
expectation value ⟨Ψi|As|Ψi⟩. Thus we can measure the expectation value of As on a single
system.
We call such a measurement [6] protective because it protects the quantum wave Ψi(x)
from the measurement. Non-adiabatic measurements of As cause the measured system to jump
to an eigenstate of As; but here, in the adiabatic limit, the system does not jump. As long as the
measurement interaction is weak enough, the system remains in the same energy eigenstate.
Before, we knew how to measure an expectation value ⟨Ψ|As|Ψ⟩only by preparing the
quantum state |Ψ⟩many times and measuring As each time. We assumed that we could not
prepare |Ψ⟩once and measure ⟨Ψ|As|Ψ⟩, just as we assumed that we cannot prepare |Ψi⟩once
and measure |Ψi(0)|2. But if we can prepare |Ψ⟩once and measure ⟨Ψ|As|Ψ⟩, perhaps we
can also measure |Ψi(0)|2, for |Ψi(0)|2 is itself an expectation value – the expectation value of
δ(x). That is, we can measure the average value of |Ψi(x)|2 in an arbitrary neighborhood as
an expectation value. For example, we can measure the value of |Ψi(x0)|2 as the expectation
value of ρD(x −x0), where ρD(x −x0) is
ρD(x −x0) = e−|x−x0|2/D2
π3/2D3

216

How to Observe a Quantum Wave
and D is arbitrary. The distribution ρD(x−x0) approaches δ(x−x0) as D →0. (As D →0,
the interaction Hint(t) grows stronger, so the duration T of the measurement must also grow.)
We can generalize the measurement of Ψi(x) in several ways. We are not limited to
measuring Ψi(x) in the neighborhood of one point. A measurement interaction with several
terms,
g(t)

i
ρD(x −xi)P (i)
d
,
allows us to measure the value of |Ψi(x)|2 at several points xi simultaneously. Again, the
duration of the measurement must grow but, given enough time, we can map the quantum
wave as completely and as precisely as we wish.1 We can also measure the average current
density in a neighborhood of a point x0 by a protective measurement of an operator JD(x0):
JD(x0) =
ℏ
2im [ρD(x −x0)∇+ ∇ρD(x −x0)] .
(15.1)
A measurement of this operator yields the probability current Ji(x),
Ji(x) =
ℏ
2im [Ψ∗
i (x)∇Ψi(x) −Ψi(x)∇Ψ∗
i (x)] ,
(15.2)
averaged over the distribution ρD(x −x0). In the notation of Sect. 4.2, a quantum wave
comprises a modulus n(x, t) and a phase ϕ(x, t),
Ψ(x, t) = n(x, t)eiϕ(x,t) ;
a stationary state depends on t only through a global phase, so n = |Ψi(x)| and ∇ϕ =
mJi(x)/|Ψi(x)|2. Thus by measuring the expectation values of |Ψi(x)|2 and Ji(x), we can
obtain ∇ϕ and reconstruct the relative phase ϕ as precisely as we wish.
A Hamiltonian Hs with a discrete, nondegenerate spectrum naturally protects its eigen-
states during a measurement; but even without such a Hamiltonian, we can protect an arbitrary
quantum wave Ψ(x, t). Chapter 12 shows that both the adiabatic limit and the limit of contin-
uous measurement suppress quantum jumps. Thus, we can protect Ψ(x, t) by continuous (i.e.
dense) measurements of any operator that, at time t, has |Ψ(t)⟩as a nondegenerate eigenstate
with an isolated eigenvalue, e.g. the projection operator |Ψ(t)⟩⟨Ψ(t)|. With continuous mea-
surement we can obtain an arbitrary evolution of the quantum wave, including the evolution
that Ψ(x, t) would have had in the absence of any measurement.

SAGREDO. These protective measurements are a great revelation to me; yet, when I try
to grasp the revelation, it slips through my ﬁngers like sand. I want to perform a protective
1Instead of increasing the duration of the measurement, we can increase the gap between the energy of |Ψi⟩and
other eigenvalues of Hs. Indeed, the larger we make the gap, the more we can speed up a protective measurement; in
principle, there is no maximum size for the gap, hence no minimum time for a protective measurement.

measurement on an unknown quantum wave Ψi(x). But in fact, I cannot perform this protective
measurement, because I cannot protect Ψi(x). To protect Ψi(x) I must know that Ψi(x) is an
eigenstate of a Hamiltonian Hs, that the corresponding eigenvalue is nondegenerate, and that
a sufﬁciently large gap separates it from other eigenvalues of Hs. Then I can protect Ψi(x)
with an adiabatic measurement. But if I know all these things, I can just as well measure the
observable Hs and identify Ψi(x) from its eigenvalue. I could then calculate the modulus and
phase of Ψi(x), and even calculate ⟨Ψi|As|Ψi⟩for any operator As. Why do we gain from
protective measurements?
SALVIATI. I appreciate your question, Sagredo; it’s a question that I asked myself, as well.
Let me point out that you can, in a sense, perform a protective measurement on an unknown
quantum wave. For example, you could leave the protection to me. If I know the Hamiltonian
Hs, I can protect Ψi(x). You can then measure the modulus and phase of Ψi(x) without even
knowing that Ψi(x) is an energy eigenstate. I only have to tell you how adiabatic to make
your measurement. Think about this example, and you will agree with me that protective
measurements are unlike any familiar measurements.
SAGR. I don’t doubt that protective measurements are unlike any familiar measurements.
But I doubt that we need them. In your example, you and I play a measurement game. But to me,
measurement is a game that we physicists play with Nature. What do protective measurements
tell us about Nature?
SALV. Well, I see your point. And I can answer your question: Protective measurements
allow us to test, for the ﬁrst time, whether the quantum wave Ψi(x) and the “expectation value”
⟨Ψi|As|Ψi⟩describe a single system in the state |Ψi⟩, or only an ensemble of systems in the
state |Ψi⟩. Consider a single particle in a square well trapped in, say, the ground state |Ψ0⟩.
If we look for the particle in the left half of the box, we either ﬁnd it or we don’t. We never
obtain 1/2, which is the expectation value of the operator ΠL that projects onto the left half of
the box. Only by measuring ΠL many times on the state |Ψ0⟩and averaging do we approach
1/2. By contrast, a single protective measurement of ΠL on a particle prepared once in the
state |Ψ0⟩yields ⟨Ψ0|ΠL|Ψ0⟩= 1/2.
Nature protects, too. Consider a system in its ground state |Ψ0⟩. If the ground state energy
is nondegenerate and discrete, then |Ψ0⟩is naturally protected. Anything in the system’s
environment that couples to an observable As of the system measures, in effect, ⟨Ψ0|As|Ψ0⟩.
SAGR. Your answer convinces me.
SIMPLICIO. But not me! Salviati, you say that by measuring ΠL many times on the state
|Ψ0⟩and averaging, we obtain the expectation value ⟨Ψ0|ΠL|Ψ0⟩. My intuition is hopelessly
classical, but isn’t a protective measurement of ΠL equivalent to a repeated measurement of
ΠL on the state |Ψ0⟩? The adiabatic limit keeps the particle in the ground state, while the device
measuring ΠL obtains 0 at some times, 1 at other times; what it ultimately, and automatically,
registers is the time average of ΠL, i.e. the expectation value of ΠL.
SALV. In quantum mechanics, a measurement of ΠL cannot yield 0 or 1 and still leave the
particle in the state |Ψ0⟩.
Now, you could assume a theory of hidden variables But let me show you how strange such
a theory would be. Let us prepare the particle, not in |Ψ0⟩, but in the ﬁrst excited state |Ψ1⟩.
As you know, |Ψ1⟩has a node in the middle of the box, and the probability density vanishes
there. Since the probability density does not vanish on either side of the node, the particle must
spend time on both sides of the node; in fact, it must always be crossing the node to spend

218
15
How to Observe a Quantum Wave
time on the other side. However, the probability density vanishes at the node, so the particle
would have to travel with inﬁnite speed at the node, in order to cross from one side of the box
to the other without spending time there. If the particle is an electron, it would radiate as it
accelerated near the node. Yet the potential is ﬂat; no force acts on the particle.
SAGR. That is strange, I agree.
SIMP. And so do I; but I would still prefer a measurement allowing me to observe a
completely unknown quantum wave. Indeed, using your method I think I can design such a
measurement. I can probe the energy levels of an unknown system spectroscopically. Once I
know its energy levels, I can design a protective measurement on it, even if I do not know its
Hamiltonian. And if the system is a particle with a Hamiltonian of the form Hs = p2/2m +
V (x), I can reconstruct V (x) from protective measurements of its charge distribution.
SALV. Such a measurement is indeed possible, Simplicio. But it would not allow us to
observe every unknown quantum wave. Alas, unitarity does not allow us to observe an arbitrary
unknown quantum wave.
15.5
Protective Measurements and Causality
Now we have some explaining to do. How do protective measurements get around the four
arguments of Sect. 15.2? What is wrong with the arguments?
The argument from experience merely shows the limitations of our experience. We must
broaden our experience! By protecting the state of the measured system, protective measure-
ments succeed where other measurements fail.
The second argument – from unitarity – is correct as far as it goes. (Salviati refers to it
at the end of the last section.) But it does not prevent us from distinguishing a state |Ψi⟩
from states orthogonal to |Ψi⟩. Any form of protection selects a set of orthogonal states. A
nondegenerate Hamiltonian selects its own (orthogonal) eigenstates; continuous observation
of a nondegenerate observable selects the (orthogonal) eigenstates of the observable. If the
selected states are |Ψn⟩, a protective measurement must ﬁnd the system in one of the states
|Ψn⟩, hence it only distinguishes the state of the system from orthogonal states.
But if we can protect any one of the states |Ψn⟩, why can’t we protect a superposition of
the states |Ψn⟩? Let us prepare a system in a superposition |Ψαβ⟩of orthogonal states:
|Ψαβ⟩= α|Ψ1⟩+ β|Ψ2⟩,
with |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Why can’t we protect |Ψαβ⟩? A measurement that protects |Ψ1⟩and
|Ψ2⟩cannot change |α| and |β| (because it suppresses quantum jumps). However, a protective
measurement on the system leaves the measuring device entangled with the measured system.
Let Φ(Qd, 0) denote the initial wave function of the measuring device, and let Φ(Qd, 0) be
peaked at Qd = 0. The combined initial wave function is Ψαβ(x, 0)Φ(Qd, 0), which evolves
to
αΨ1(x, T)Φ (Qd −g0⟨Ψ1|As|Ψ1⟩, T)
+ βΨ2(x, T)Φ (Qd −g0⟨Ψ2|As|Ψ2⟩, T)
(15.3)
over time T. Each of the states |Ψ1⟩and |Ψ2⟩is protected, but there is nothing that protects the
entangled state of the measured system and the measuring device, and it collapses. The measur-

15.5
Protective Measurements and Causality
219
ing device does not remain in a macroscopic superposition but points to Qd = g0⟨Ψ1|As|Ψ1⟩
with probability |α|2, or to Qd = g0⟨Ψ2|As|Ψ2⟩with probability |β|2.
The third argument – from linearity – is correct as far as it goes, too. The evolution of
Ψαβ(x, 0)Φ(Qd, 0) is indeed linear, yielding the superposition in Eq. (15.3). Thus the measur-
ing device points either to g0⟨Ψ1|As|Ψ1⟩or to g0⟨Ψ2|As|Ψ2⟩at the end of the measurement.
It does not point to g0⟨Ψαβ|As|Ψαβ⟩and we do not expect it to point to g0⟨Ψαβ|As|Ψαβ⟩;
the quantum wave Ψαβ(x, t) is not protected, so we cannot measure it.
The fourth argument invokes relativistic causality. If Alice and Bob can protect the state
[|ΨA⟩+ |ΨB⟩] /
√
2, then Bob can instantly change the result of Alice’s measurement. How-
ever, the normalized wave functions ΨA(x, t) and ΨB(x, t) are disjoint, by assumption. If
the Hamiltonian Hs of their shared electron is local, then ⟨ΨA|Hs|ΨB⟩vanishes. It follows
that [|ΨA⟩+ |ΨB⟩] /
√
2 is degenerate with [|ΨA⟩−|ΨB⟩] /
√
2, and the Hamiltonian of the
electron does not protect the state [|ΨA⟩+ |ΨB⟩] /
√
2. Alice and Bob must protect their state
some other way. But the other ways involve explicitly nonlocal interactions. For example, Al-
ice and Bob can remove the degeneracy between [|ΨA⟩+ |ΨB⟩] /
√
2 and [|ΨA⟩−|ΨB⟩] /
√
2
by introducing an interaction between |ΨA⟩and |ΨB⟩in Hs. But such a nonlocal interaction
violates relativistic causality.
Here is a related, and subtler, argument. For simplicity, we conﬁne the electron to the x-
axis. Alice’s box is a one-dimensional potential well, and we assume that outside the box the
potential vanishes, but the electron wave function does not. Alice prepares the electron in the
ground state |Ψ0⟩of the well, with energy −E. She measures |Ψ0(0)|2, the expectation value
of |Ψ0(x)|2 in the center of the well, and ﬁnds a nonzero value. If she repeats the measurement,
she ﬁnds the same value. Now suppose that Bob decides to look for the electron a distance L
along the x-axis from the potential well. It is very unlikely that Bob will ﬁnd the electron, for
the probability density |Ψ0(L)|2 is exponentially small; we have
|Ψ0(L)|2 ≈1
ℏ(2mE)1/2e−2L(2mE)1/2/ℏ,
(15.4)
where m is the mass of the electron. But |Ψ0(L)|2 is not zero, so Bob might ﬁnd the electron.
If he does, Alice will obtain zero for her measurement of |Ψ0(0)|2. Thus Bill can send a
superluminal message to Alice. Bob has only a small chance of transmitting the message, but
Alice and Bob can improve the chance of transmission by preparing an ensemble of electrons
in the state |Ψ0⟩.
This thought experiment is a paradox if the duration T of Alice’s protective measurement
is smaller than the time it takes for a light signal to reach her from Bob, i.e. if we assume
T < L/c. But we applied the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in our treatment of protective
measurements; we have taken large T for granted. What does the upper bound T < L/c
do to protective measurements? If T is too short, the protective measurement may not be
adiabatic; then Alice’s measurement may kick the electron out of the well.
That is, she
may obtain |Ψ0(0)|2 = 0 not because Bob found the electron but because her measurement
was not adiabatic, and excited the electron to a state with positive energy. So we ask, what
is the minimum probability that Alice’s measurement kicks the particle out of well, if the
measurement lasts a time T < L/c? If this probability is larger than the probability of Bob’s
ﬁnding the particle a distance L from the well, we have no paradox; Alice cannot conclude

220
15
How to Observe a Quantum Wave
that Bob is sending her a message when her measurement of |Ψ0(0)|2 yields zero. It is more
likely that the measurement itself kicked the particle out of the well.
What is the minimum probability that a measurement lasting a time T will cause a quan-
tum jump in energy of at least E? Let us try to estimate the minimum probability. (See also
Probs. 15.4–5.) It is sufﬁcient to consider a system with two nondegenerate energy eigen-
states; additional states could only increase the probability of a transition. Hence we assume
a measurement interaction of the form
Hint = g(t)AsPd ,
where As is a 2-by-2 matrix. If g(t) is an analytic function of t there are general methods to
calculate the probability of a transition, and a few exact results [7]. Here g(t) cannot be an
analytic function, because an analytic function of t cannot vanish over any interval in t, and
Hint is nonzero for a time interval not longer than T. However, if g(t) is analytic and changes
gradually enough, Hint is less likely to induce quantum jumps than if g(t) has ﬁnite support.
Suppose the coupling is
g(t) = g0
T sechπt
T ,
(15.5)
which is exponentially small except during a period of time of order T, and normalized ac-
cording to
 ∞
−∞
g(t) dt = g0 .
(See Fig.
15.2.)
Let Hs = Eσz/2 be the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the model, with
eigenstates | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩, and let Hint = g(t)σxPd. At time t = −∞the combined state of
the measured system and the measuring device is | ↓⟩⊗|Φd⟩= | ↓, Φd⟩, where Φd(Qd) is the
wave function of the pointer position Qd. The probability of a transition is
Pjump = |⟨↑|e−i
 ∞
−∞dt[Hs+Hint(t)]/ℏ| ↓, Φd⟩|2 .
We apply the exact calculation of N. Rosen and C. Zener [8], who assumed the coupling of
Eq. (15.5), to obtain
Pjump = ⟨Φd| sin2(g0Pd/ℏ)sech2(ET/2ℏ)|Φd⟩.
The state |Φd⟩is not an eigenstate of Pd; but the exponential factor in Pjump does not depend
on the expectation value of sin2(g0Pd/ℏ); we have
Pjump ≈e−ET/ℏ
(15.6)
as an estimate of the minimum probability of a transition due to Alice’s protective measure-
ment.2
2Although the probability of | ↑⟩in the ﬁnal state is exponentially small, at intermediate times the coefﬁcient of
| ↑⟩in the state of the measured system may not be exponentially small. (See Prob. 15.8.) Yet at time T the coefﬁcient
is exponentially small and Alice’s measuring device is not entangled with the measured system.

Now we compare the exponents in Eqs. (15.4) and (15.6). The probability that Alice’s
measurement kicks the electron out of the well, assuming that her measurement is as adiabatic
as possible in the time T, is of order e−ET/ℏ. For a paradox, this probability must be smaller
than the probability that Bob ﬁnds the electron a distance L from the well, i.e.
e−ET/ℏ< e−2L(2mE)1/2/ℏ,
or
ET > 2L(2mE)1/2 .
(15.7)
To satisfy these inequalities, we need only choose E large enough, for given T, L and m. A
paradox, indeed!
We know that the Schr¨odinger equation allows arbitrary speeds; we cannot impose rel-
ativistic causality on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. But this paradox does not involve
superluminal speeds, or any speeds; like Bell’s inequality, it involves only measurements at
spacelike separations. Why isn’t it consistent with relativistic causality?
Let us consider how large E has to be for the paradox to arise. Squaring both sides of
Eq. (15.7), we have ET 2 > 8L2m > 8c2T 2m or E > 8mc2. We conclude that Bob can send
Alice a superluminal signal if the binding energy of Alice’s electron is several times mc2.
The paradox, then, has a remarkable resolution. The quantum mechanics of a single particle
in an arbitrary potential is inconsistent with the constraint of relativistic causality. Bob can send
Alice a superluminal signal, unless we impose a (quite artiﬁcial) limit on the depth of Alice’s
potential well. But in relativistic quantum theory, particles multiply; a potential step greater
than 2mc2 creates electron-positron pairs (as Klein’s paradox [9] demonstrates). A potential
step of E > 2mc2 in Alice’s well would create electron-positron pairs, and these would
inﬂuence Alice’s measurement much more than Bob’s Geiger counter. Since, in relativistic
quantum theory, Alice cannot bind a lone electron with a binding energy greater than 2mc2,
Bob cannot send Alice a superluminal signal [10]. Indeed, this paradox belongs to the class of
contradictions (or would if it had preceded the development of quantum ﬁeld theory): it shows

222
15
How to Observe a Quantum Wave
that quantum mechanics with arbitrary potentials and ﬁxed particle number is incompatible
with relativistic causality. Only a new theory can resolve the paradox.
15.6
Towards Quantum Field Theory
For Schr¨odinger, Ψ(x, t) was a classical wave, analogous to a classical light wave. But for
us, Ψ(x, t) is a quantum wave, and the analogy with classical light is not so relevant. More
relevant is the analogy between Ψ(x, t) and quantum light. Like Ψ(x, t), quantum light waves
are measurable. The quantum wave Ψ(x, t) describes a particle, and a quantum light wave
describes particles – photons.
A ﬂaw in the analogy is that Ψ(x, t) corresponds to only one particle, while a quantum
light wave corresponds, in general, to many. But as the previous section indicates, this ﬂaw
disappears when Ψ(x, t) goes relativistic.
Relativistic quantum theory is a many-particle
theory. A nonrelativistic quantum wave can describe one particle; a relativistic quantum wave
must describe many particles. Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is self-consistent, but it
is inconsistent with relativistic causality, because protective measurements – unlike quantum
correlations, and unlike modular variables – allow Bob to send a superluminal signal to Alice.
(See Chaps. 5–6.) But relativistic quantum theory must be consistent with relativistic causality;
it cannot allow superluminal signalling. As the last section shows, there are two ways to prevent
superluminal signalling: we can forbid any potential step that is several times mc2, or we can
allow the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. There is no natural way to
forbid deep potential wells; it would be unrealistic to forbid them. Thus, we must allow pair
creation – which takes us to relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory.

– and thus send Alice a superluminal message – by looking for particles a distance L
away!” However, there is a ﬂaw in Sagredo’s argument. Sagredo states that if Bob
ﬁnds the particle, Alice’s measurement yields |Ψ0(0)| = 0. This statement is consistent
with relativistic causality – the particle cannot reach Alice during her measurement if
L > cT. Show, however, that the statement implies that Alice’s measurement yields
|Ψ0(0)| = 0 with the same probability whether or not Bob looks for the particle a
distance L away.
15.7 Let A, with eigenstates |ai⟩, be an observable of one system, and let |ψi⟩be states of

Thus a protective measurement on a single system can yield tr (ρA). (See also Prob. 9.6.)

How to Observe a Quantum Wave

have eigenvalues E+ and E−, respectively.
Let ψ(t) be the exact solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation iℏ(d/dt)ψ(t) = Hψ(t); we can write ψ(t) as
ψ(t) = α+(t)e−iE+t/ℏψ+(t) + α−(t)e−iE−t/ℏψ−(t) .
At t = 0, α−(t) vanishes; at t = T, it can be chosen exponentially small in T (i.e.
suppressed by e−ϵT where ϵ is a constant).
Show, however, that α−(t) cannot be
exponentially small at all intermediate times.

16 Weak Values
What is the problem with quantum mechanics? The problem is not just that quantum mechanics
contradicts our everyday intuitions. So does the special theory of relativity! But special
relativity offers us new and powerful intuitions about space and time, mass and energy, and
causality. By contrast, quantum mechanics seems to offer only negatives: no determinism, no
complete description, no objective reality. What about the positive in quantum mechanics?
In these last three chapters, we emphasize the positive; and we emphasize that the positive in
quantum mechanics often hides behind the negative.
For example, the word “quantum” entered physics in 1900 as a constraint on classically al-
lowed values of observables. Planck’s quantum postulate constrains the energies of a resonator
to discrete values. And in quantum mechanics, it is axiomatic that the only allowed values of an
observable are its eigenvalues. Yet in many ways, quantum mechanics is freer from constraints
than classical mechanics. Take quantum tunnelling as an example. In classical mechanics, a
particle cannot cross a potential barrier greater than its total energy; it cannot have negative
kinetic energy. In quantum mechanics, it can cross such a barrier. Can it have negative kinetic
energy? The axiomatic answer is “No! The eigenvalues of kinetic energy are all positive!”
(See Prob. 16.1.) But Sect. 16.4 goes beyond this answer to deﬁne the weak value of an
observable. The weak value of an observable need not be an eigenvalue; indeed, it need not be
any classically allowed value. Weak values offer intuition about a quantum world that is freer
than we imagined – a world in which particles travel faster than light, carry unbounded spin,
and have negative kinetic energy.

A Weak Measurement
Here is a thought experiment that seems to disobey the uncertainty relations. It disobeys very,
very infrequently. But even if it disobeys only once, quantum mechanics is inconsistent. So
this thought experiment, like the thought experiments of Sects. 2.4, 4.1 and 15.1, challenges
the consistency of quantum mechanics.

For a measurement of Sz, we take the interaction Hamiltonian
Hint = g(t)PdSz/

as usual, Pd is conjugate to the position Qd of a pointer, and

dtg(t) = g0. The factor 1/

weakens the effectivecouplingtoeachspin. Weassumethatthemeasurementisimpulsive; then
the change in Qd during the measurement is g0Sz/
√
N. The uncertainty in this measurement
of Sz is ∆Sz = (
√
N/g0)∆Qd, where ∆Qd is the uncertainty in Qd.
The expectation value of Sz in the state |Ψin⟩vanishes, while the expectation value of S2
z
is Nℏ2/4. Hence most measured values of Sz are of order
√
Nℏ/2. Such a value may well
be an error, since ∆Sz is itself proportional to
√
N. But suppose a measured value of Sz is
Nℏ/2. Is it an error?
We expect a measurement of Sz to change |Ψin⟩, which is not an eigenstate of Sz. How
does |Ψin⟩change? An individual spin state (| ↑⟩i + | ↓⟩i)/
√
2 evolves to
[e−ig0Pd/2
√
N| ↑⟩i + eig0Pd/2
√
N| ↓⟩i]/

Hence the probability that the measurement leaves the i-th spin in the initial state (| ↑⟩i+
| ↓⟩i)/
√
2 is
⟨Φd| cos2(g0Pd/2
√
N)|Φd⟩,
where Φd(Qd) represents the initial wave function of the pointer. The probability that the
measurement leaves all the spins in the initial state |Ψin⟩is ⟨Φd| cos2N(g0Pd/2
√
N)|Φd⟩,
which approaches ⟨Φd|e−g2
0P 2
d /4|Φd⟩for large N. We can estimate the expectation value of
P 2
d from (∆Pd)2 ≈ℏ2/4(∆Qd)2. (The expectation value of Pd vanishes for the stationary
pointer.) Thus for large N, the measurement leaves the initial state |Ψin⟩unchanged with
probability
e−g2
0ℏ2/16(∆Qd)2
which can be arbitrarily close to 1.
So it seems that a measurement could yield Sz = Nℏ/2 without changing the initial state
|Ψin⟩at all. But |Ψin⟩is an eigenstate of Sx, not of Sz. Can we know both Sz and Sx at the
same time? How can we explain this measurement?
These formulas apply also to a two-slit interference experiment with N particles. Let
the states | ↑⟩i and | ↓⟩i represent the i-th particle passing through the left and right slits,
respectively. (See Fig. 16.1.) Then measuring Sz shows the number of particles passing
through the left slit minus the number passing through the right slit. For large enough N, a
measurement of Sz on the state |Ψin⟩could show all the particles passing through the left slit,
with no change in |Ψin⟩. But with no change in |Ψin⟩, the measurement does not destroy the
interference!

A Paradox of Errors

16.2
A Paradox of Errors
In this book, measurements are quantum measurements, i.e. we treat measuring devices as
quantum systems. Chapter 7 deﬁnes an interaction Hamiltonian for measuring an observable
As:
Hint = g(t)AsPd .
(16.1)
It is convenient to take g(t) impulsive and g0 =

g(t)dt = 1. The measuring device is a
quantum system, hence it has a quantum state. But Chaps. 7 and 8, which discuss quantum
measurements in the Heisenberg formalism, do not refer to the state of the measuring device;
and even Chap. 9, which discusses quantum measurements in the Schr¨odinger formalism, refers
to the state of the measuring device only formally. For example, Eq. (9.3) refers to the initial
state |0⟩of a pointer without further deﬁning |0⟩. In this respect, our treatment of quantum
measurements is not yet complete. When we discuss the state of the measuring device, we see
how the model of von Neumann accounts for errors in quantum measurements.
Let us deﬁne an initial state Φin(Qd) of the measuring device:
Φin(Qd) = (ϵ2π)−1/4e−Q2
d/2ϵ2 .
(16.2)
The width of the peak in Φin(Qd) depends on ϵ according to ∆Qd = ϵ/
√
2. Small ϵ corre-
sponds to small uncertainty in Qd and in As. But it also corresponds to a strong measurement
interaction: since ∆Pd is large, we cannot take the range of Pd in Eq. (16.1) to be small. Con-
versely, large ϵ corresponds to large uncertainty in Qd and As, and also to a weak measurement
interaction. The limit ϵ →0 deﬁnes an ideal measurement; in this limit ∆Qd vanishes, and the
change in the pointer position equals an eigenvalue of As with no error. Real measurements,
however, can yield errors; and Φin(Qd) is a source of errors. Note that a quantum measure-
ment of As obeying Eqs. (16.1–2) could yield any value, although large errors are exponentially
suppressed. There is no mystery in these errors; since ∆Qd does not vanish, we expect them.
Measurements of a nonnegative observable such as kinetic energy could even yield unphysical
negative values. Of course, the Qd dial could have a pin to prevent the pointer from turning to
negative values, but let us assume it does not. It should not. For even if a measured value of

228
16
Weak Values
As is unphysical, it belongs to a physical distribution of measured values. It helps us estimate
the width and peak value of the distribution, and we should not throw it out.
So just by deﬁning the initial state of the measuring device, we obtain a model for measure-
ment errors. In this model, errors have a natural interpretation: they represent scatter around
the true value of an observable, which can only be an eigenvalue of that observable. They are
due not to the measured system, but to uncertainty in the measuring device. If a measured
system is in an eigenstate of As, then ∆As depends only on ∆Qd, and the model implies (as
it should) that more accurate measurements (smaller ∆Qd) yield fewer errors (smaller ∆As).
Indeed, since ∆As depends only on ∆Qd, errors tell us nothing about the measured system.
For the example of kinetic energy measurements, the model implies that measured values may
be negative, but also that negative values are unphysical – errors due to the uncertainty in Qd.
At the risk ofbelaboringtheobvious, westressthatthisinterpretationofmeasurementerrors
is natural and consistent. Yet we now present a thought experiment [1] with an incompatible
interpretation. Here is the experiment in brief: We prepare a large number of particles bound in
a potential well, in an eigenstate of energy. Next, we measure the kinetic energy of each particle,
with an accuracy that depends on the measuring device. Finally, we look for particles far from
the potential well. That is, after the kinetic energy measurement is complete, we measure the
positions of all the particles, and select particles found “far enough” from the potential well
– with “far enough” depending on the accuracy of the kinetic energy measurement. We ﬁnd
very few particles “far enough” from the potential well, but for these particles, we ﬁnd that the
kinetic energy measurements gave negative values. Even more remarkable is the distribution
of the values: the peak value equals the negative kinetic energy (total energy minus potential
energy) of a bound particle outside its potential well; also, the width of the peak is the expected
width for measurements with this measuring device. So are these values errors?
Here is the thought experiment in detail: The Hamiltonian for a bound particle in one
dimension is
Hs = p2
2m + V (x) .
(16.3)
For simplicity, we choose V (x) to be a negative δ-function potential, vanishing for x ̸= 0.
Then Hs has a single bound state,
Ψin(x) = √αe−α|x| ,
with eigenvalue −ℏ2α2/2m. Let Ψin(x) be the initial state of the particle. The initial state of
the measuring device is the gaussian Φin(Qd) of Eq. (16.2), and the interaction Hamiltonian
for the measurement is Hint of Eq. (16.1) with p2/2m for As. (Nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics is consistent with such a nonlocal interaction.) For simplicity, again, we assume that
the measurement is impulsive, so that we can neglect Hs for the duration of the measurement.
Then the combined state of the particle and measuring device evolves from Ψin(x)Φin(Qd)
at the beginning of the measurement to
e−(i/ℏ)Pdp2/2mΨin(x)Φin(Qd)
(16.4)
at the end. At the end of the measurement, we look for the particle far from the origin. Let the
ﬁnal state of the particle be

16.2
A Paradox of Errors
229
Ψfin(x) = (δ2π)−1/4e−(x−x0)2/2δ2 ,
where δ and x0 satisfy two conditions:
δ > αℏ2/mϵ
(16.5)
and
x0 ≫δ3mϵ/ℏ2 .
(16.6)
In words, for a more accurate (smaller ϵ) measurement of kinetic energy, the ﬁnal state of the
particle must be broader (larger δ) and farther from the well (larger x0). (Together, Eqs. (16.5–
6) imply x0 ≫α3ℏ4/m2ϵ2.) Of course, there is no assurance that we will ﬁnd the particle
in this ﬁnal state; on the contrary, the probability is small. But we assume that we can repeat
the experiment as many times as we like, until a sufﬁcient number of particles satisfy these
conditions.
Now for these particles only, we look at the values of kinetic energy that the measuring de-
vice recorded before we checked the ﬁnal position of each particle. What do the measurements
show? We obtain the ﬁnal state Φfin(Qd) of the measuring device by projecting Eq. (16.4)
onto Ψfin(x):
Φfin(Qd) = N⟨Ψfin|e−(i/ℏ)Pdp2/2m|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd) .
(16.7)
Here N is a normalization factor. Equation (16.7) entails an integration over x. Since Ψfin(x)
is localized far from the origin, it is plausible that the operator p in Eq. (16.7) takes the value
−iℏα when applied to Ψin(x). If so, the ﬁnal, normalized state of the measuring device is
Φfin(Qd) = Φin(Qd + α2ℏ2/2m) ,
(16.8)
and represents the measuring device with its pointer shifted to the “unphysical” negative value
−α2ℏ2/2m.
To derive Eq. (16.8) rigorously, we express Ψin(x) as a Fourier transform,
Ψin(x) =
 ∞
−∞
dp e−ipx/ℏ
α2ℏ2 + p2
up to a normalization factor, and replace the operator p with its eigenvalues. The exponential of
−(i/ℏ)Pdp2/2m translates Qd to Qd −p2/2m, and after the x-integration Eq. (16.7) becomes

where N ′ is for normalization. The integrand in Eq. (16.9) has poles at p = ±iαℏ, and we can
regard the integral as part of a contour integral. (See Fig. 16.2.) The contour includes the line
ℑp = −p0 with p0 > αℏ. Then the integral reduces to two terms: a pole term proportional to

(16.10)
The absolute value of Eq. (16.10) depends on x0 only through the exponential of (α −
p0/ℏ)x0. The rest of Eq. (16.10) is ﬁnite. Then, since α −p0/ℏis negative, the correction
vanishes in the limit x0 →∞. The correction is small if x0 and δ satisfy Eqs. (16.5–6). (See
Prob. 16.4.)
So we arrive at a paradox. On the one hand, negative measured values of kinetic energy
arise from uncertainty in the initial position of the pointer, and not from the measured system.
Therefore they are unphysical. On the other hand, the negative measured values of kinetic
energy in our thought experiment are uncannily physical. Does a particle with total energy
−α2ℏ2/2m, in a region of vanishing potential energy, have kinetic energy equal to −α2ℏ2/2m?
Indeed, kinetic energy measurements of such particles, found far from the potential well that
binds them, yield a distribution peaked at −α2ℏ2/2m; and the width of the peak corresponds
to the accuracy of the measuring device. We ﬁnd this peak for any realistic measurements, i.e.
for any ϵ greater than zero.
Freud found hidden meaning in slips of the tongue; here, we ﬁnd hidden meaning in
measurement errors. But now measurement errors have two incompatible interpretations!
16.3
Pre- and Postselected Ensembles
In classical mechanics, the initial state of a closed system determines its ﬁnal state, and vice
versa. For a complete description of a classical system, we can impose a complete set of
initial or ﬁnal boundary conditions; complete sets of initial and ﬁnal conditions would be
either redundant or inconsistent. Not so in quantum mechanics; the initial state of a closed
system does not determine its ﬁnal state, and we can impose complete initial and ﬁnal boundary
conditions. The contrast between classical and quantum boundary conditions suggests that,
for the most complete description of a quantum system, we not only can, we must impose
complete sets of initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions.

16.3
Pre- and Postselected Ensembles
231
How do we impose ﬁnal boundary conditions? The same way we impose initial boundary
conditions: we select for them. (See Sect. 10.4.) For example, we impose the initial boundary
condition Sx = ℏ/2 by measuring Sx on spin-1/2 particles and selecting those for which
Sx = ℏ/2. Similarly, we can impose the ﬁnal boundary condition Sz = ℏ/2 by measuring
Sz on spin-1/2 particles and selecting those for which Sz = ℏ/2. Either way we select,
but for an initial boundary condition we preselect (before other measurements), while for a
ﬁnal boundary condition we postselect (after other measurements). Together, initial and ﬁnal
boundary conditions deﬁne a pre- and postselected (PPS) ensemble. PPS ensembles arise
naturally in sequences of measurements. Given a sequence of measurements, we deﬁne a PPS
ensemble by preselecting a result of the initial measurement and postselecting a result of the
ﬁnal measurement. Intermediate measurements are measurements on the PPS ensemble.
If these intermediate measurements are ideal – if the measuring devices do not introduce
errors – then we can apply the ABL formula to them. (See Sect. 10.3.) But in any realistic
measurement there is a chance of errors arising from the measuring device. Can we neglect
the chance of errors? If not, we cannot apply the ABL formula. The thought experiment of the
last section is an example of a realistic measurement on a PPS ensemble. Here we encounter
another example, and the next section treats such measurements in general.
The example [2] concerns a PPS ensemble of spin-1/2 particles. The initial boundary
condition Sx = ℏ/2 and ﬁnal boundary condition (Sz −Sx)/
√
2 = ℏ/2 together deﬁne the
ensemble. Suppose we measure Sz on this ensemble. The interaction Hamiltonian for each
particle is Eq. (16.1) with Sz in place of As:
Hint(t) = g(t)SzPd .
We assume, for simplicity, that there are no other terms in the Hamiltonian; then Sz does not
change during the measurement. We deﬁne the initial state Φin(Qd) of the measuring device
as in Eq. (16.2). Thus the initial state of one spin-1/2 particle and a measuring device is
1
√
2 (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩) Φin(Qd)
and it evolves during the Sz-measurement to

Wait! We made an error!
But we made no error. The distribution really peaks at the value (1 +

2)ℏ/2, more than
twice the largest eigenvalue of Sz. Moreover, the width of the peak corresponds to the accuracy
of the measuring devices. The measuring devices “err” so consistently, they seem to be trying
to err.
In Hilbert space no one can hear you scream; but these mute measuring devices are trying
to tell a story. What is their story?
16.4
Weak Measurements and Weak Values
We can generalize the example of the last section. For a pre- and postselected ensemble, we
preselect an initial state |Ψin⟩and postselect a ﬁnal state |Ψfin⟩, with ⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩̸= 0. In
between the pre- and postselection, we measure a nondegenerate Hermitian operator. The
initial state of the measuring device is Φin(Qd) in Eq. (16.2), and the interaction Hamiltonian
for the measurement is Hint in Eq. (16.1). (We now drop the subscript on As.) Again, we
choose g(t) impulsive and assume that, during the measurement, the time evolution operator
for the measured system and measuring device is
e−(i/ℏ)APd .
Then after the postselection, the (unnormalized) state of the measuring device is
⟨Ψfin|e−(i/ℏ)APd|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd) =

i
⟨Ψfin|ai⟩⟨ai|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd −ai) .
Here the ai are eigenvalues of A and the |ai⟩are corresponding eigenstates.
In the limit ϵ →0, Φin(Qd −ai) and Φin(Qd −aj) are orthogonal for i ̸= j. So
for ideal measurements, the probability of an outcome ai is proportional to the norm of
⟨Ψfin|ai⟩⟨ai|Ψin⟩squared, as the ABL formula states. (See Eq. (10.8).) In the opposite
limit, ϵ is large and so is the uncertainty in Qd. On the other hand, ∆Pd is small,
∆Pd = ℏ/
√
2ϵ ,
and the expectation value of Pd vanishes for a stationary pointer. Thus we take Pd to be small
and expand the time evolution operator:
⟨Ψfin|e−(i/ℏ)APd|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd) ≈⟨Ψfin|1 −(i/ℏ)APd|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd)
= ⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩[1 −(i/ℏ)⟨A⟩wPd] Φin(Qd)

Here ⟨A⟩w (also denoted Aw) is the weak value of A on the PPS ensemble [3]:

Weak Values
The notation ⟨A⟩w recalls ⟨A⟩; weak values indeed reduce to expectation values when |Ψfin⟩=
|Ψin⟩. Eq. (16.13) shows that the displacement of the pointer is ⟨A⟩w:
Φfin(Qd) ≈e−(i/ℏ)⟨A⟩wPdΦin(Qd) = Φin(Qd −⟨A⟩w) .
Thus for large ϵ, the measured values of A cluster around ⟨A⟩w.

into Eq. (16.14). So is the negative value of kinetic energy of Sect. 16.2; we have
⟨p2/2m⟩w = ⟨Ψfin|(p2/2m)|Ψin⟩
⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩
,
where |Ψin⟩represents a particle bound by the δ-function potential well, and |Ψfin⟩represents
a particle far from the well. Equation (16.3) implies
p2/2m = Hs −V (x)
as an operator equation, and Eq. (16.14) implies, in general,
⟨A + B⟩w = ⟨A⟩w + ⟨B⟩w ;
and in particular,
⟨p2/2m⟩w = ⟨Hs⟩w −⟨V (x)⟩w .
Now ⟨Hs⟩w = −α2ℏ2/2m because |Ψin⟩is an eigenstate of Hs,
Hs|Ψin⟩= −(α2ℏ2/2m)|Ψin⟩,
and ⟨V (x)⟩w = 0 because V (x) vanishes in the ﬁnal state, V (x)|Ψfin⟩≈0. We have
⟨p2/2m⟩w = −α2ℏ2/2m, the “unphysical” negative kinetic energy of Sect. 16.2.
A measurement of A that yields ⟨A⟩w consistently is a weak measurement. As Eq. (16.13)
shows, a measurement of A on the PPS ensemble always yields ⟨A⟩w if ϵ is sufﬁciently
large. (See also Prob. 16.6.) But from the example of negative kinetic energy we see that
a measurement may be weak even if ϵ is not large.
For any given ϵ, the kinetic energy
measurement is weak if |Ψfin⟩satisﬁes Eqs. (16.5–6).
In the other example, |Ψfin⟩is given and the measurement yields ⟨Sz⟩w = (1 +

Experiments on an optical version of this example demonstrated weak values [4]. Other ap-
plications of weak values include measurements of arrival times of particles tunnelling through
potential barriers [5], loss of interference in two-slit interferometers [6], and measurements of
superluminal and subluminal photon speeds [7].
16.5
A Quantum Shell Game
Place three walnut shells on a table, and let’s play a “shell game”.1 One player – call him
Shelly – shifts a small coin quickly among the three shells, while the rest of us guess (and bet)
where it is. In a (ho hum) classical shell game, the coin is certainly under one of the shells,
and Shelly, at least, knows which one. What about a quantum shell game?
A quantum coin can be in a superposition of three states |A⟩, |B⟩, |C⟩– one state for each
shell. For example, Shelly could prepare the coin in the initial state
|Ψin⟩=
1
√
3(|A⟩+ |B⟩+ |C⟩) .
(16.17)
By looking under one of the shells, we measure one of the projection operators ΠA = |A⟩⟨A|,
ΠB = |B⟩⟨B|, ΠC = |C⟩⟨C|. The result of the measurement is either 1 or 0: the coin is either
there or not there; it is never partly there. To model a quantum measurement of a projection
operator, let’s suppose that the coin carries a positive charge. We send an electron past a shell,
and if the coin is in the shell, its charge deﬂects the electron. A model interaction Hamiltonian
for a measurement of ΠC is
Hint = −g(t)ΠCX ,
(16.18)
where X is the transverse position of the electron. Again, it is convenient to assume g0 =

g(t)dt = 1. Let the initial state of the electron be
Φ(P) = (ϵ2ℏ2π)−1/4e−P 2/2ϵ2ℏ2 ,
(16.19)
where P is the transverse momentum; for simplicity, we neglect the other components of the
electron momentum. The transverse momentum of the electron changes according to
dP
dt = g(t)ΠC ,
so it changes by ΠC during the measurement. If the coin is in shell C (in state |C⟩) the
electron deﬂects to the right; if it is not in shell C, the electron continues in a straight line. (See
Fig. 16.4.)
1Also called “thimblerig”.

So far, the quantum game resembles the classical game. But Shelly plays the game with
pre- and postselection. So if our measurement is ideal, we can apply the ABL formula; if our
measurement is weak, we can calculate weak values of ΠA, ΠB and ΠC. Suppose the ﬁnal
state is
|Ψfin⟩=
1
√
3(|A⟩+ |B⟩−|C⟩) .
The ABL formula shows that the coin is certainly in shell A if we look there:
|⟨Ψfin|ΠA|Ψin⟩|2
|⟨Ψfin|ΠA|Ψin⟩|2 + |⟨Ψfin|(ΠB + ΠC)|Ψin⟩|2 = 1 .
(See Prob. 10.6.) Similarly, the coin is certainly in shell B if we look there. Only if we look
in shell C do we have a chance (equal to 4/5) of not ﬁnding the coin. So – if Shelly postselects
this ﬁnal state – the quantum shell game pays better than the classical game!
Similarly, the weak values of ΠA and ΠB are both 1. But the weak value of ΠC is −1.
What is the meaning of ⟨ΠC⟩w = −1? Measurement supplies the meaning: Eqs. (16.13) and
(16.18) imply that the electron we send past shell C deﬂects to the left instead of to the right,
as if the coin carried a negative charge. (See Fig. 16.5.) But ΠC has no negative eigenvalue!
An optical version of this experiment, in which the three “shells” were three interfering photon
paths in a modiﬁed Mach-Zehnder interferometer, indeed yielded these weak values [8].

The Quantum Walk
237
The weak value of ΠC might not even be real. In general, Eq. (16.14) is complex. Suppose
the initial state is still |Ψin⟩of Eq. (16.17) but Shelly postselects the ﬁnal state
|Ψfin⟩=
1
√
3(i|A⟩−|B⟩−i|C⟩) .
For this PPS ensemble the weak value of ΠB is 1, while ⟨ΠA⟩w = −i and ⟨ΠC⟩w = i.
Negative charge is familiar, but what about imaginary charge? How do we measure – and
interpret – an imaginary weak value?
Imaginary weak values have a general effect on the size of PPS ensembles [9]. Con-
sider a weak measurement of an observable A on an ensemble of systems preselected in the
state |Ψin⟩and postselected in the state |Ψfin⟩. What fraction of the preselected systems
pass the postselection? Equation (16.13) shows that, as long as ⟨A⟩w is real, the fraction is
|⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩|2. That is, the size of the PPS ensemble depends on |Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩– but not on
A. But if ⟨A⟩w is not real, then e−(i/ℏ)⟨A⟩wPd is not unitary, and the size of the PPS ensemble
depends on the imaginary part of ⟨A⟩w. That is, the measurement creates or destroys systems
in the pre- and postselected states. So ⟨A⟩wPd imitates a nonunitary Hamiltonian, i.e. an
effective Hamiltonian for a process that creates or destroys systems. (See Prob. 16.9.) In our
example, when ⟨ΠC⟩w is imaginary ⟨ΠC⟩wX imitates an effective Hamiltonian that couples
an imaginary charge to the passing electron.2
16.6
The Quantum Walk
A weak value depends on pre- and postselected states of a system. Hence a measured weak
value depends on the pre- and postselected states of a system. A measured value depends on
the state of a system after the measurement? Can we say that? The most complete description
of a quantum system, we claim, involves two state vectors, past and future boundary conditions
on the system. The contrary claim is that the most complete description of a quantum system
involves only one state, and we are just playing a game of errors: Weak measurements yield
errors, from which we postselect weak values.
A game – even a game of errors – has rules. Consider a system with a Hamiltonian H
and two observables, A and B, that commute with H but not with each other. The initial state
of the system is |Ψin⟩, with A|Ψin⟩= a|Ψin⟩; the ﬁnal state of the system is |Ψfin⟩, with
B|Ψfin⟩= b|Ψfin⟩. What can we say about possible intermediate measurements? We can
say that a measurement of A at an intermediate time would yield a, or even that a measurement
of A and then B would yield a and then b. We cannot say that a measurement of B and then A
would yield b and then a, since a measurement of B may disturb A. But weak measurements
disturb less. Consider a PPS ensemble with the initial and ﬁnal states |Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩. A
weak measurement of A on this PPS ensemble would yield a distribution peaked at a, even
after a weak measurement of B. A weak measurement of, say, A+B would yield a distribution
2Note that if ⟨ΠC⟩w is real, then ⟨P⟩shifts by ⟨ΠC⟩w during the measurement. But if ⟨ΠC⟩w is imaginary,
⟨P⟩does not shift at all. Rather, it is the conjugate variable ⟨X⟩that shifts: the imaginary charge shifts ⟨X⟩by
i⟨ΠC⟩w/ℏϵ2 during the measurement. The conjugate variable X shifts when the initial state Φ(P) is a gaussian in
P. In general, the vacuum state of the electric ﬁeld is a gaussian in E and an imaginary weak charge could shift the
vector potential A conjugate to the electric ﬁeld E, changing the magnetic ﬁeld B. See Prob. 16.10 and Sect. 17.5.

238

Weak Values
peaked at a + b, the weak value of A + B, even if a + b is not an eigenvalue of A + B. This
game works because weak measurements obey two rules. First, weak measurements of A and
B disturb each other only slightly. Second, weak measurements are inaccurate and can yield,
“by error”, the weak value ⟨A + B⟩w = ⟨A⟩w + ⟨B⟩w.
These two rules are intimately related. The second concerns the uncertainty ∆Qd in the
position of a pointer; the ﬁrst concerns the conjugate momentum Pd and its uncertainty ∆Pd.
A measurement of A with interaction Hamiltonian Hint,
Hint = g(t)APd ,
implies a change in B that is proportional to Pd:
dB
dt = i
ℏg(t)[B, A]Pd .
If the measurement is ideal, the initial wave function Φin(Qd) of the pointer is a δ-function;
then Pd and dB/dt are unbounded. Conversely if we bound dB/dt, the measurement cannot
be ideal and there will be errors. For example, if we bound Pd to a ﬁnite interval, then Φin(Qd)
will be analytic and extend over the complex Qd plane.3 Then the expansion of the exponential
in Eq. (16.13) will be valid and the measured value will be the weak value. Moreover, the shift
in Qd will not change the shape of Φ(Qd). (See Eq. (5.8).) The game of errors is consistent.
Because the game is consistent, we can play it two different ways. We now do so and
arrive at the “quantum walk”. Consider a set of N spin-1/2 degrees of freedom with zero
Hamiltonian. Let Sx, Sy and Sz be components of total spin, as in Eq. (16.15), and let the
initial state |Ψin⟩be an eigenstate of Sx:
|Ψin⟩= 2−N/2
N
"
i=1
(| ↑⟩i + | ↓⟩i) .
The initial wave function of the measuring device is the gaussian Φin(Qd) in Eq. (16.2). Thus
the overall initial state is |Ψin⟩Φin(Qd). Let the ﬁnal state |Ψfin⟩of the spins be
|Ψfin⟩=
N
"
i=1
(α↑| ↑⟩i + α↓| ↓⟩i) ,
where |α↑|2 + |α↓|2 = 1. On the PPS ensemble with these initial and ﬁnal spin states, we
measure the observable C = 2Sz/Nℏ. Then the ﬁnal state of the measuring device is, up to
normalization,
⟨Ψfin|e−i2SzPd/Nℏ2|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd) .
(16.20)
Now on the one hand, we can calculate the ﬁnal state by immediately expanding the
exponential in Eq. (16.20). Applying Eq. (16.13), we ﬁnd that the pointer moves to the weak
value
⟨C⟩w = ⟨Ψfin|C|Ψin⟩
⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩
= α↑−α↓
α↑+ α↓
.
3For Φin(Qd) to be analytic it is sufﬁcient, but not necessary, to bound Pd to a ﬁnite interval. Equation (16.2) is
analytic and its Fourier transform is nonzero for all Pd, vanishing exponentially in |Pd|2.

16.6
The Quantum Walk

Note ⟨C⟩w can be any complex number, while the eigenvalues of C range from −1 to 1. On
the other hand, we can calculate the ﬁnal state of the pointer by ﬁrst applying e−i2SzPd/Nℏ2 to
the initial state |Ψin⟩Φin(Qd):
e−i2SzPd/Nℏ2|Ψin⟩Φin(Qd) = 2−N/2

the pointer:

Φin(Qd) .
(16.22)
Equation (16.22) represents a superposition of many pointer states. Expanding the expression
in brackets according to the binomial theorem, we see that it is a superposition of pointer states
displaced by at most 1 in either direction. So how can Eq. (16.22) represent a pointer displaced
by ⟨C⟩w if ⟨C⟩w is out of this range?
Apparently the pointer states interfere, constructively for Qd ≈⟨C⟩w and destructively for
other values of Qd. Indeed, we can verify this interference. Since
α↑e−iPd/Nℏ+ α↓eiPd/Nℏ≈α↑(1 −iPd/Nℏ) + α↓(1 + iPd/Nℏ)
= (α↑+ α↓) −(α↑−α↓)iPd/Nℏ
= (α↑+ α↓)(1 −i⟨C⟩wPd/Nℏ)
(16.23)
and
lim
N→∞(1 −i⟨C⟩wPd/Nℏ)N = e−i⟨C⟩wPd/ℏ,
(16.24)
we ﬁnd that, for large enough N, Eq. (16.22) does indeed imply the ﬁnal pointer state Φfin(Qd)
= Φin(Qd −⟨C⟩w).
Mathematically speaking, Eq. (16.22) does not look like e−i⟨C⟩wPd/ℏΦin(Qd). Eq. (16.22)
corresponds to a superposition of waves eikPd/ℏwhere k = −1, −1 + 2/N, −1 + 4/N, . . . , 1.
If e−i⟨C⟩wPd/ℏis not one of these waves, how can we obtain it by superposing them? Sur-
prisingly, we can: this superposition, called a superoscillation, is consistent with Fourier’s
theorem [10]. Physically, Eq. (16.22) is analogous to a random walk. We can generate a ran-
dom walk in one dimension by tossing a coin at each step. In Eq. (16.22), we toss a quantum
coin – a spin – to generate a quantum random walk [11]. If the coefﬁcients α↑and α↓in
Eq. (16.22) were probabilities, each term in the expansion of Eq. (16.22) would represent a
random walk, with a coefﬁcient equal to its probability. A classical random walk of N steps
yields a typical displacement of
√
N, and never more than N. But the coefﬁcients α↑and α↓
are probability amplitudes; the quantum walk superposes classical random walks and yields
arbitrary displacements.
Section 16.2 presents a paradox of two incompatible interpretations. Each interpretation
is self-consistent, and the calculations to which they correspond are equivalent. We have a
paradox, but no contradiction. We just have to choose an interpretation. But each interpretation

240

rests on an assumption. If we say that kinetic energy can be negative, we say that values
measured as kinetic energy, clustering as expected for kinetic energy, around a predicted
negative value of kinetic energy, are negative kinetic energy. This interpretation rests on the
assumption that physical theories should be simple. If we say that kinetic energy cannot be
negative, we say that a measured value cannot depend on what follows the measurement. This
interpretation rests on the assumption that quantum mechanics contains an arrow of time – an
assumption that Chap. 10 challenges.
16.7
Faster than Light
Negative kinetic energy and imaginary charge are just two among many surprising weak values.
We now apply the quantum walk to show that the weak speed of a charged particle can exceed
the speed of light in vacuo. Next we calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the particle and ﬁnd
that it emits Cherenkov radiation: like any charged particle moving faster than light through
a medium, a superluminal particle emits Cherenkov radiation [12]. Weak superluminal speed
illustrates the consistency among weak measurements on a PPS ensemble.
We start with a Hamiltonian for a particle moving at constant speed: H = pzvz, where
pz = −iℏ∂/∂z and vz operates on an internal Hilbert space of the particle:
vz = c
N
N

i=1
σ(i)
z
.
(The Pauli matrices represent speed, not spin; the particle has no magnetic moment.) The
eigenvalues of vz are −c, −c + 2c/N, . . . , c −2c/N, c, where c is the speed of light. The
particle moves with speed vz in the z-direction,
˙x = [x, H]/iℏ= 0 ,
˙y = [y, H]/iℏ= 0 ,
˙z = [z, H]/iℏ= vz ,
hence the change in position z measures vz.
If the only allowed values of vz are its eigenvalues, the speed of the particle cannot exceed
the speed of light. But consider the following weak measurement of vz. At t = 0, we preselect
an initial state |Ψin⟩Φ(x, 0), where Φ(x, 0) represents the particle approximately localized at
x = (x, y, z) = 0,
Φ(x, 0) = (ϵ2π)−3/4e−x2/2ϵ2 ,
(16.25)
and |Ψin⟩is the particle’s internal state. At time t we postselect the internal state |Ψfin⟩. For
|Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩we choose, as in the last section,
|Ψin⟩= 2−N/2

241
with |α↑|2 +|α↓|2 = 1. Our chances of postselecting the state |Ψfin⟩may be very small, but if
we repeat the experiment again and again, eventually we will postselect |Ψfin⟩. Then Φ(x, t)
is
Φ(x, t) = ⟨Ψfin|e−ipzvzt/ℏ|Ψin⟩Φ(x, 0) ,
(16.27)
up to normalization. Evaluating Eq. (16.27) exactly, we obtain
Φ(x, t) = 2−N/2 
α↑e−ipzct/Nℏ+ α↓eipzct/NℏN
Φ(x, 0) .
(16.28)
Just as in Eqs. (16.23–24) we expand
α↑e−ipzct/Nℏ+ α↓eipzct/Nℏ≈α↑(1 −ipzct/Nℏ) + α↓(1 + ipzct/Nℏ)
= (α↑+ α↓) −(α↑−α↓)ipzct/Nℏ
= (α↑+ α↓)(1 −ipz⟨vz⟩wt/Nℏ) ,
(16.29)
and since
lim
N→∞(1 −ipz⟨vz⟩wt/Nℏ)N = e−ipz⟨vz⟩wt/ℏ
(16.30)
we ﬁnd that, for large N, Φ(x, t) ≈Φ(x, y, z −⟨vz⟩wt, 0). At time t the particle is displaced
by ⟨vz⟩wt along the z-axis. Now if α↑and α↓are real and α↑α↓is negative, then the weak
value of vz,
⟨vz⟩w = ⟨Ψfin|vz|Ψin⟩
⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩
= α↑−α↓
α↑+ α↓
c ,
exceeds c in magnitude. Thus the weak speed of the particle could be superluminal.
Weak superluminal speed could be an error, since the width ϵ of Φ(x, 0) must be nonzero.
(Otherwise there would be no tails in Φ(x, t) to interfere constructively near z = ⟨vz⟩wt.) Yet
the weak value does not seem to be an error, because whenever our pre- and postselections
(which are independent of Φ(x, 0)) yield |Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩, respectively, measured values of
the displacement of the particle over a time t cluster about ⟨vz⟩wt.
For measurements of vz to to cluster about the weak value, the probability of postselecting
|Ψfin⟩must be smaller than the probability of obtaining the weak value by error (without post-
selection). Otherwise, when we postselect |Ψfin⟩, we would most likely not get superluminal
speed. Now consider repeated weak measurements of the particle’s position. Since weak
measurements do not interfere with one another, the measured values will be uncorrelated;
there will be no trend towards superluminal speed, even if one of the measurements shows the
particle travelling with superluminal speed. Or consider the measured value Sz = Nℏ/2 of
Sect. 16.1. The value is irrelevant to subsequent measurements of Sz, which are just as unlikely
as before to yield Sz = Nℏ/2; it is just an error. Without postselection, there is no consistency
in measurement errors. Unless and until we postselect, they are just errors. With pre- and
postselection, however, measured values in this thought experiment consistently exceed c.
The charged particle has an electromagnetic ﬁeld. What is the ﬁeld when ⟨vz⟩w is superlu-
minal? Suppose ﬁrst that vz equals one of its eigenvalues, and let V (x′, t; vz) denote the scalar

potential at x′, t of a particle of charge q moving along the z-axis with z = vzt. We obtain
V (x′, t; vz) via a Lorentz boost, by vz in the z-direction, of the Coulomb potential V (x′, t; 0):
V (x′, t; vz) = q

(16.31)
We obtain the vector potential A(x′, t; vz) in the same way; it has only one nonzero component,
Az(x′, t; vz) = vz
c V (x′, t; vz) .
These are the classical potentials of a point charge moving along the axis with z = vzt. But
our moving charge is a quantum particle, and its potentials are quantum potentials. To treat
these potentials, we simply postulate an effective two-particle interaction between the moving
charge and a test particle. That is, to the Hamiltonian H = pzvz of the moving charge we add
the Hamiltonian H′ of a (nonrelativistic) test particle:
H′ =
1
2m (p′ −q′A)2 + q′V .
(16.32)
In H′, the test particle has mass m and charge q′, and the potentials are

(16.33)
The equations of motion obtained from H + H′ yield (x, y, z) = (0, 0, vzt) together with the
correct motion of the test particle in the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the moving charge.4 Now
we treat V and Az as quantum operators and calculate their effect on the test particle. We
will see that if the moving charge has weak speed ⟨vz⟩w, then ⟨vz⟩w takes the place of vz in
Eqs. (16.33).
We preselect the state |Ψin⟩Φ(x, 0) of the moving charge and, after a time T, postselect
the state |Ψfin⟩. (See Eqs. (16.25–26).) We also prepare the test particle in a localized state
Ω(x′, 0), where Ω(x′, 0) is analytic in x′. Since we want the test particle to measure the
instantaneous values of V and Az at the end of this evolution (and not their average values
during or after the evolution), we “turn on” H′ instantaneously at time T. (Formally, we
multiply H′ by δ(t −T).) The state of the moving charge and the test particle after the
postselection is then
Φ(x, T)Ω(x′, T) = ⟨Ψfin|e−i[(p′−q′A)2/2m+q′V ]/ℏe−ipzvzT/ℏ|Ψin⟩Φ(x, 0)Ω(x′, 0) .
(16.34)
The potentials V and A in Eq. (16.34), as deﬁned by Eqs. (16.33), contain vz. But we can
show that the weak speed ⟨vz⟩w should replace vz in Eq. (16.34). We begin with the right-hand
side of Eq. (16.34). We can expand the ﬁrst exponential,
e−i[(p′−q′A)2/2m+q′V ]/ℏ,
4The equation of motion (x, y, z) = (0, 0, vzt) implies V (x′) = V (x′, t; vz) and Az(x′) = Az(x′, t; vz). The
equation of motion for the momentum p of the moving charge is unphysical, but it has no measurable consequences.

in the power series. We drop the factor ⟨Ψfin|Ψin⟩(to normalize) and obtain
Φ(x, T)Ω(x′, T) = e−i[(p′−q′A)2/2m+q′V ]/ℏΦ(x, y, z −⟨vz⟩wT, 0)Ω(x′, 0) ,
where
Az = ⟨vz⟩w
c
V = ⟨vz⟩w
c
V (x′ −x, 0; ⟨vz⟩w) .
Since V (x′ −x, 0; ⟨vz⟩w) equals V (x′) as deﬁned in Eqs. (16.33) with ⟨vz⟩w taking the place
of vz, the scalar and vector potentials are exactly the potentials of a charge moving with weak
speed ⟨vz⟩w (folded with the width of the localized state Φ) and have the corresponding effect
on the test particle. Now if ⟨vz⟩w exceeds the speed of light, V and Az correspond to Cherenkov
radiation, the shock wave of a charged particle moving faster than light through a medium.5

Galilean Dialogue
[Simplicio, Salviati and Sagredo stop at the Kinneret beach.]
SAGREDO. Frankly, Salviati, I again feel the sand slipping through my ﬁngers. You want
two states – a past state evolving forwards in time and a future state evolving backwards in time
– to describe a quantum system. Negative kinetic energy is remarkable – even irresistable –
but how far can we control future states? The world we live in does contain an arrow of time,
even if quantum theory does not, so these measurements on pre- and post-selected ensembles
are artiﬁcial.
SIMPLICIO. As for me, I was unable to follow all the mathematics, and it is still quite
unclear to me when to call a measured value an error and when to call it a weak value. But I
was struck by your remark that a measured negative value of kinetic energy – even if it exactly
coincides with the predicted negative value – is not yet a measured weak value, unless and until
we postselect.
5For ⟨vz⟩w superluminal, V (x′ −x, 0, ⟨vz⟩w) vanishes outside a cone trailing the source. For imaginary weak
speed see Sects. 16.5 and 17.5.

Weak Values
SALVIATI. Otherwise we would deny the very possibility of errors in measurements, which
of course we do not. The correlation between weak measurements and postselection is – must
be – a one-way correlation. Postselecting |Ψfin⟩after weak measurements of A on |Ψin⟩, we
ﬁnd that the measured values cluster around ⟨A⟩w, however strange ⟨A⟩w may be. But unless
we postselect |Ψfin⟩, the weak measurements rarely yield ⟨A⟩w, and those that do, do not
improve our chances of postselecting |Ψfin⟩. Therefore, the probability that the measurement
yields ⟨A⟩w by error, small as it is, must exceed the probability of postselecting |Ψfin⟩.
SAGR. That is what bothers me – the miniscule probability of postselecting |Ψfin⟩and
the conditions on |Ψfin⟩.
SALV. Sagredo, the examples may seem artiﬁcial, but pre- and postselected states describe
the quantum world more completely than do preselected states alone. Shouldn’t a more com-
plete description come at higher price? Small probabilities and conditions on the postselected
state are the price we pay for a more complete description.
Postselection turns measurement errors into superluminal speed and ﬂuctuations of the
vacuum into Cherenkov radiation. The description is complete and consistent: a measured
weak value may strike us as madness, but then we look at other weak values measured on the
same PPS ensemble and see method in the madness.
SIMP. Superluminal speed is not consistent with relativistic causality!
SAGR. Oh, but it is, Simplicio. We assumed that Φ(x, 0), the wave function of the moving
charge, is analytic, just as the wave function Φin(Qd) of a pointer must always be analytic.
The pointer shows the weak value only if Φin(Qd) is analytic, because then Φin(Qd) does not
vanish for any interval in Qd and can show, “by error”, the weak value. Likewise Φ(x, 0) is
analytic in z, so Φ(x, 0) and its derivatives at a given z determine Φ(x, 0) for all z. Hence
Φ(x, t) = Φ(x, y, z −⟨vz⟩wt, 0) does not transmit any message, for the message is the same
for all z and t. Since it does not transmit any message, it does not transmit any superluminal
message, and weak superluminal speed is consistent with relativistic causality.
SIMP. Where is free will in this “complete description”?
SALV. Weak values are compatible with free will! Following a measurement of A we
can either postselect, or measure A again. If we postselect, we may interpret the result of the
measurement of A as a weak value ⟨A⟩w; if we remeasure A, we may interpret the same result
as an error. These two interpretations are consistent, for they apply to different ensembles –
the former to a pre- and postselected ensemble and the latter to a preselected ensemble. How
we interpret a measured value depends on what else we choose to measure, but no one tells us
what to measure.

a weak measurement. But let an observer a distance D from the charge measure its
position at t = 0 with uncertainty ∆z ≪ϵ. Then the width of Φ(x, 0) will not satisfy
the condition. If D ≤ct the observer may have causally disturbed the charge, but
if D > ct there cannot be any causal inﬂuence of the observer on the charge. So do
we conclude that the measurement cannot be weak? Derive

17 Weak Values and Entanglement
Chapter 1 declares that we will not stop asking about quantum mechanics, “But how can it
be like that?” Here and there, the declaration is hard to uphold, and nowhere harder than in
Chap. 3. Chapter 3 sets out the only reasonable explanation of quantum entanglement – and
shows that it doesn’t work; as Bell put it, “The reasonable thing just doesn’t work.” Still we
ask, “But how can entanglement be like that?”
In this chapter, we study entanglement using weak values. We consider weak measurements
between a preselected state |Ψin⟩and a postselected state |Ψfin⟩, where |Ψin⟩is entangled.
For example, the paradox in the next section involves an electron and a positron between pre-
and postselected states, where the preselected state is entangled. Weak measurements show
these particles to be entangled in unexpected ways.
17.1
Interaction-free Paradox
Section 6.4 describes the interaction-free measurement of Elitzur and Vaidman. The measuring
device is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. (See Fig. 6.8.) If both paths through the interferom-
eter are clear, a photon passing through it exits in the direction of constructive interference. But
assume that a “bomb” (a detector) blocks one of the paths, and the bomb is certain to explode
if a photon hits it (the detector is perfectly efﬁcient). Even so, the bomb may not explode, and
the photon may exit the interferometer in the direction of destructive interference. The bomb,
by not exploding, reveals which path the photon took, and thus eliminates the interference
between the two paths. Or, as Sect. 6.4 puts it, the bomb acts at a distance on the photon by
changing the expectation value of a modular operator.
Consider now sending electrons or positrons, instead of photons, through such an inter-
ferometer. Hardy [1] invented a paradox with two interferometers, one for electrons and the
other for positrons. The interferometers overlap in a corner where a path in one interferometer
crosses a path in the other. (See Fig. 17.1.) The momenta of the particles and the dimensions of
the interferometers are such that electrons passing through the electron interferometer always
arrive at detector C−if no positron enters their interferometer, and positrons passing through
the positron interferometer always arrive at detector C+ if no electron enters their interferome-
ter. (The C in C−and C+ denotes constructive interference.) But if an electron and a positron
pass through the interferometers simultaneously, they may annihilate each other in the over-
lapping corner. Let us assume that an electron and a positron passing through simultaneously
always annihilate each other whenever their paths cross. If the particles annihilate each other,
no detector clicks. What if they do not annihilate each other?

Figure 17.1: Two Mach-Zehnder interferometers with over-
lapping paths.
If the paths of the particles do not cross, there are three possibilities. The positron may
take its overlapping path while the electron takes its nonoverlapping path. We will denote this
state |o⟩+ ⊗|no⟩−. Or the electron may take its overlapping path while the positron takes
its nonoverlapping path; then their state is |no⟩+ ⊗|o⟩−. Finally, both particles may take
nonoverlapping paths. Then the state is |no⟩+ ⊗|no⟩−. All three states are equally probable,
and if we absorb their phases into the deﬁnitions of the states |o⟩+, |o⟩−, |no⟩+ and |no⟩−, the
state of the particles as they exit the interferometers (before they arrive at the detectors) is
|Ψin⟩=
1
√
3 [|o⟩+ ⊗|no⟩−+ |no⟩+ ⊗|o⟩−+ |no⟩+ ⊗|no⟩−] .
If we project |Ψin⟩onto the positron’s nonoverlapping path |no⟩+, we leave the electron in the
state +⟨no|Ψin⟩= [|o⟩−+ |no⟩−]/
√
2. We have assumed that in this case detector C−clicks.
Hence detector D−must click for the orthogonal state [|o⟩−−|no⟩−]/
√
2. Similarly, detector
C+ clicks for the positron state −⟨no|Ψin⟩= [|o⟩+ + |no⟩+]/
√
2 and detector D+ clicks for
the orthogonal state [|o⟩+ −|no⟩+]/
√
2. Now if we compute joint probabilities for electrons
and positrons, we ﬁnd that detectors C−and C+ click together with probability 3/4, and each
other pair of detectors (C−and D+, D−and C+, D−and D+) clicks with probability 1/12, if
the particles do not annihilate each other.
What do these clicks tell us? If the detector D+ clicks, it tells us that the electron crossed
into the positron interferometer; for, by assumption, positrons always arrive at detector C+ if
no electron enters their interferometer. Thus we conclude that the electron took its overlapping
path (and the positron took its nonoverlapping path). Similarly, if the detector D−clicks, it
tells us that the positron crossed into the electron interferometer; for, by assumption, electrons
always arrive at detector C−if no positron enters their interferometer. Thus we conclude that
the positron took its overlapping path (and the electron took its nonoverlapping path).
But what if detectors D−and D+ click together? We may conclude from the clicking
of detector D+ that the electron took its overlapping path, and we may conclude from the
clicking of detector D−that the positron took its overlapping path. But if both particles took
their overlapping paths, they must have annihilated each other! The simultaneous clicking of
D−and D+ leads to the paradoxical conclusion that neither D−nor D+ could have clicked.

A Grin Without a Cat
251
Thus the logic that explains the Elitzur-Vaidman experiment does not explain Hardy’s
experiment; it produces a paradox, not an explanation. We can describe the electron and the
positron via modular variables, but they do not resolve the paradox. (See Prob. 17.1.)
17.2
A Grin Without a Cat
Cats come and go, but not as the grinning Cheshire Cat would come and go:
“Did you say ‘pig,’ or ‘ﬁg’?” said the Cat.
“I said ‘pig,’ ” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy!”
“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with
the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest
of it had gone.
“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a
cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!” [2]
Indeed, it is curious; but like many curious things, it has a quantum explanation. This section
explains how the Cheshire Cat could disappear while leaving its grin behind.
Cats are complicated systems. (See Chap. 9.) To simplify, we approximate the Cheshire
Cat as a particle with two grin states, | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩; in the state | ↑⟩the Cat grins. (In the state
| ↓⟩it frowns.) Two states, |1⟩and |2⟩, represent locations of the Cat in two cozy boxes. We
assume that the Hamiltonian of the Cat commutes with the projection operators for the grin
state
Π↑≡| ↑⟩⟨↑| ,
Π↓≡| ↓⟩⟨↓|
and the location
Π1 ≡|1⟩⟨1| ,
Π2 ≡|2⟩⟨2|
of the Cat. At time t = 0, we preselect the Cat in the state
|Ψin⟩= 1
2 [| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩] |1⟩+ 1
2 [| ↑⟩−| ↓⟩] |2⟩,
and we postselect it at time t = T in the state
|Ψfin⟩= 1
2[| ↑⟩−| ↓⟩] [|1⟩+ |2⟩] .
Where is the Cat at intermediate times? To locate the Cat, we calculate the weak values of
Π1 and Π2. At times 0 ≤t ≤T we have ⟨Π1⟩w = 0 and ⟨Π2⟩w = 1. So, clearly, the
Cat passes its time in box 2. Is it grinning during this time? It sure is! We calculate that
⟨σz⟩w = ⟨Π↑−Π↓⟩w = 1, so at all intermediate times, the Cat is grinning.
The Cat is grinning, and the Cat is in box 2. Hence it is obvious, dear Alice, that the Cat
is grinning in box 2. Obvious, but false: the weak value of σzΠ2 vanishes. There is no net

252
17
Weak Values and Entanglement
grin in box 2! We can measure the Cat’s grin and location simultaneously (since σz commutes
with the projectors Π1 and Π2); but the weak value of the product ⟨σzΠi⟩w does not equal
the product of the weak values ⟨σz⟩w and ⟨Πi⟩w. Thus, although the Cat grins and the Cat is
in box 2, we cannot conclude that the grin is in box 2! On the contrary, the grin is in box 1 –
the weak value of σzΠ1 is 1. The Cheshire Cat is in box 2 but its grin is in box 1.
A grin without a cat! Although the preselected state |Ψin⟩entangles the location of the
Cat and its grin state, we seem to have quite disentangled the grin and the Cat. To analyze this
effect, let us calculate the weak values of products of the projectors Π1, Π2, Π↑and Π↓. We
have
⟨Π1Π↑⟩w = 1/2 ,
⟨Π1Π↓⟩w = −1/2 ,
⟨Π2Π↑⟩w = 1/2 ,
⟨Π2Π↓⟩w = 1/2 .
(17.1)
These four weak values add up to 1, as they must since Π↑+ Π↓= 1 = Π1 + Π2. The four
products Π1Π↑, Π1Π↓, Π2Π↑and Π2Π↓sum to 1 and ordinarily represent occupation; e.g.
Π1Π↑represents the occupation of box 1 by the grinning Cat. But while the eigenvalues of a
projector can be only 0 or 1, and the expectation value of a projector in any state must lie in
the interval [0, 1], the weak value of Π1Π↓is negative.
“Curiouser and curiouser!” as Alice might say. Yet if we interpret these weak values
carefully, they give a consistent account of the Cheshire Cat. The weak location of the Cat is
in box 2, because ⟨Π2⟩w is the sum of ⟨Π2Π↑⟩w and ⟨Π2Π↓⟩w, both of which equal 1/2; it
could not be in box 1, because the sum of ⟨Π1Π↑⟩w and ⟨Π1Π↓⟩w vanishes. The net weak
grin in box 2 vanishes, because ⟨Π2Π↑⟩w represents a grinning Cat and ⟨Π2Π↓⟩w represents
a frowning Cat. But a frown is an inverted grin, i.e. it is a grin with respect to an inverted
axis. (See Fig. 17.2.) Since the weak values of the grin and the frown in box 2 are equal, they
cancel one another. Most curious is the grin in box 1. The weak value of the frown in box 1 is
=
=

grin with respect to the inverted axis.

−1/2; but a negative weak value for a frown counts as a positive weak value for a grin, hence
⟨Π1Π↑⟩w and ⟨Π1Π↓⟩w combine to yield a grin without a cat.
As noted, cats are complicated systems. We cannot yet separate a cat from its grin, but
we could try separating a simpler system from its internal degrees of freedom. For example,
we could try separating a neutron from its magnetic moment; the equations of this section
apply to a neutron and its magnetic moment just as they apply to the Cat and its grin. We
preselect neutrons in a neutron interferometer [3] in the state |Ψin⟩and postselect them in the
state |Ψfin⟩, where now | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩refer to neutron spin states and |1⟩and |2⟩refer to the
two arms of the interferometer. Any measurement, weak or strong, of the neutron’s location
will ﬁnd the neutron in state |2⟩, i.e. will locate the neutron in arm 2 of the interferometer.
Any measurement will also show the neutron to have σz = 1. (See Prob. 17.2.) A weak
measurement of σzΠ2 will show that ⟨σzΠ2⟩w vanishes, while a weak measurement of σzΠ1
will show that ⟨σzΠ1⟩w equals 1. What does it mean to measure σzΠ1 and σzΠ2 weakly?
We could, for example, weakly measure the magnetic ﬁeld in both arms of the interferometer;
the measurements would show that the magnetic moment of the neutron takes arm 1 of the
interferometer. The magnetic moment takes one arm of the interferometer but the neutron itself
takes the other arm!
17.3
Alice and Bob in Wonderland
Let us apply weak values to the EPR-Bohm experiment. (See Sect. 3.4.) Alice and Bob share
many pairs of spin-1/2 systems prepared in an initial singlet state
|Ψin⟩= [| ↑⟩A ⊗| ↓⟩B −| ↓⟩A ⊗| ↑⟩B] /
√
2 .
Alice measures the spin component of each of her systems along an axis that she chooses at
random from a ﬁnite list of axes; Bob does likewise for his systems, from the same list. For
example, on some pairs Alice may measure the spin component along the x-axis while Bob
measures the spin component along the y-axis. Let us assume that they do, and we consider
only those pairs for which σA
x = 1 and σB
y = 1; that is, we postselect the state
|Ψfin⟩= [| ↑⟩A + | ↓⟩A] ⊗[| ↑⟩B + i| ↓⟩B] /2 .
(17.2)
Here is a formulation of the EPR paradox: we assume, with EPR, that the results of Alice’s
measurements cannot depend on Bob’s choice of axis, and vice versa. Hence the systems,
before reaching Alice’s and Bob’s respective laboratories, must carry (at least) deﬁnite values
of σA
x , σA
y , σB
x and σB
y , all independent of what axes Alice and Bob will choose. Now note
that |Ψin⟩is an eigenvalue of the three operators σA

From these eigenvalue equations we can draw conclusions about observables that Alice and Bob
did not measure on these postselected pairs. From Eq. (17.3) we conclude that σB
x = σA
y = −1,
while from Eq. (17.4) we conclude that σA
y σB
x = −1. But these are incompatible conclusions!
How can it be like that? Let us proceed, as we did in the last section, by calculating weak
values of projectors. We deﬁne four projectors, ΠA
↑y and ΠA
↓y projecting onto states with
σA
y = ±1 and ΠB
↑x and ΠB
↓x projecting onto states with σB
x = ±1. Explicitly, they are
ΠA
↑y = (| ↑⟩A + i| ↓⟩A) (A⟨↑| −iA⟨↓|) /2 ,
ΠA
↓y = (| ↑⟩A −i| ↓⟩A) (A⟨↑| + iA⟨↓|) /2 ,
ΠB
↑x = (| ↑⟩B + | ↓⟩B) (B⟨↑| + B⟨↓|) /2 ,
ΠB
↓x = (| ↑⟩B −| ↓⟩B) (B⟨↑| −B⟨↓|) /2 .
The weak values of the products ΠA
↑yΠB
↑x, ΠA
↑yΠB
↓x, ΠA
↓yΠB
↑x and ΠA
↓yΠB
↓x are
⟨ΠA

↑x⟩w = −1/2 ,
⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↓x⟩w = 1/2 ,
⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↑x⟩w = 1/2 ,
⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↓x⟩w = 1/2 .
(17.5)
Hence for Alice’s systems, we have
⟨ΠA
↑y⟩w = ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↑x⟩w + ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↓x⟩w = 0 ,
⟨ΠA
↓y⟩w = ⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↑x⟩w + ⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↓x⟩w = 1 ,
and so the weak values conform to the constraint σA
y = −1. Similarly, for Bob’s systems we
have
⟨ΠB
↑x⟩w = ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↑x⟩w + ⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↑x⟩w = 0 ,
⟨ΠB
↓x⟩w = ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↓x⟩w + ⟨ΠA
↓yΠB
↓x⟩w = 1 ,
and so the weak values conform to the constraint σB
x = −1. Finally, we compute the weak
value of σA
y σB
x to get
⟨σA

x ⟩w =

so this weak value conforms to the constraint σA
y σB
x = −1. Note that the projectors ΠA

and ΠA
↓yΠB
↓x correspond to σA
y σB
x = 1, but the negative weak value ⟨ΠA

values in Eq. (17.5) from |Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩, we could have obtained them as the solutions of
the three constraints ⟨σA
y ⟩w = −1, ⟨σB
x ⟩w = −1 and ⟨σA
y σB
x ⟩w = −1.
In our calculations, we took |Ψfin⟩of Eq. (17.2) to be the postselected state. But we could
have chosen any product state as the postselected state. In particular, we could take |Ψfin⟩to

17.4

255
be any state postselected from Alice’s measurements of σA
x or σA
y and Bob’s measurements of
σB
x or σB
y . Then, by folding the weak values between |Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩with the probability of
postselecting |Ψfin⟩, we would obtain “probabilities” for all four observables that Alice and
Bob might measure, whether or not they in fact measure them. The probabilities would not be
limited to the interval [0, 1] however. (See Prob. 17.6.)
Negative probabilities are not new; Wigner was the ﬁrst to apply them to quantum theory
[4]. However, negative probabilities have never had implications for measurements. Here
they arise in weak values, measurable in weak measurements. Still, we must interpret these
negative weak values with care.
Negative probabilities do not make quantum mechanics
more reasonable. So we do not interpret ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↑x⟩w = −1/2 as a negative probability.
Our (minimal) interpretation is that pairs of spin systems can have opposite physical effects,
according to the sign of ⟨ΠA
↑yΠB
↑x⟩w. In general, physical systems can have opposite physical
effects, in weak measurements, according to the signs of the weak values.
Consider the shell game of Sect. 16.5, for example. In the classical shell game, a single
coin lurks under one of three shells; the occupation is 1 for one shell and 0 for the two others.
In the quantum shell game (with pre- and postselection), the weak “occupation” is −1 for one
shell and 1 for the two others. In both the classical and the quantum games, the total occupation
is 1. But in the quantum game, a positively charged coin with weak value ⟨ΠC⟩w = −1 repels
passing electrons as if it were a negatively charged coin in shell C. How many coins are there
in the quantum game – one, or three? There is only one coin, since the weak negative charge
in shell C repels passing electrons, but does not attract the other two shells (which themselves
attract passing electrons). Yet this one coin can attract and repel electrons.

SIMPLICIO. So this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, “Doc, my brother’s crazy – he
thinks he’s a chicken!” And, uh, the doctor says –
SALVIATI. We all know the joke, Simplicio.1
SIMP. Well, when you say that a negative charge can masquerade as a positive charge, or
is negative with negative probability, aren’t you saying that quantum mechanics is crazy?
SALV. Negative probabilities are unreasonable, I agree. But I can reasonably interpret
weak values – even unexpected weak values – according to their effects on measuring devices.
SIMP. You only show how unreasonable quantum mechanics is.
SALV. I show how quantum mechanics is unreasonable.
SAGREDO. Perhaps, Simplicio, I can help you understand what Salviati is saying. The
guy in the joke is certainly crazy, yet it’s not certain that the guy’s brother is crazy. Likewise,
the fact that quantum mechanics drives us crazy does not prove that quantum mechanics is
crazy.
SALV. It drives us crazy because we still think classically, and it is not classical. We have to

We cannot change the laws of probability either – logic and probability are too closely related.

Weak Values and Entanglement
But weak values can help us stop thinking classically about quantum mechanics. There is a
paradox about an electron and a positron in overlapping interferometers –
SAGR. We talked about it.2
SALV. Well, the paradox has the following conventional explanation. “We can talk only
about what we measure. For example, we can demonstrate that the positron took its overlap-
ping path by placing a sensor on its overlapping path (outside the electron interferometer). The
electron can arrive at detector D−because the positron, by crossing into the electron interfer-
ometer, destroys the interference between the overlapping and nonoverlapping electron paths.
The positron can arrive at detector D+ because our sensor destroys the interference between
the overlapping and nonoverlapping positron paths. There is no paradox!”
SAGR. And if we don’t place any sensor?
SIMP. “We can talk only about what we measure.”
SALV. If we think classically, we can talk only about what we measure. But consider the
weak values of Π−
no, Π−
o , Π+
no and Π−
o and their products, where Π−
no projects onto the state
|no⟩−, etc. The simultaneous clicking of D−and D+ deﬁnes the postselected state, and we
obtain ⟨Π−
noΠ+
no⟩w = −1, ⟨Π−
noΠ+
o ⟩w = 1, and ⟨Π−
o Π+
no⟩w = 1. Also ⟨Π−
o Π+
o ⟩w vanishes,
thus the electron and positron never take their overlapping paths together. Yet each particle
takes its overlapping path separately, because ⟨Π−
o ⟩w = ⟨Π−
o Π+
no⟩w + ⟨Π−
o Π+
o ⟩w = 1 and
⟨Π+
o ⟩w = ⟨Π−
noΠ+
o ⟩w + ⟨Π−
o Π+
o ⟩w = 1.
SIMP. What are you saying, that one electron-positron pair can show up simultaneously,
in various guises, on three different pairs of paths? I can’t accept that.
SALV. Can’t you? Well, then, can you accept that one positively charged coin can show
up simultaneously, in various guises, under three shells?3
SIMP. Yes, I can. But now I see no reason to accept one and not the other.
17.5
Complex Weak Values
Weak values need not be real. So far, in applying weak values to entanglement, we have
encountered real weak values. But Sect. 16.5 gives an example of an imaginary weak projector
in the quantum shell game. Here we present an example of how imaginary weak values and
entanglement can go together. The example – a calculation of the vector potential of a dipole
of imaginary strength – is at ﬁrst puzzling and even seems to contradict relativistic causality.
Yet there is no contradiction.
Suppose two equal and opposite charges separate only at time t = 0, making an instanta-
neous dipole. We can write the charge and current densities of the dipole as follows [5]:
ρ(x, t) = eσzδ(x)δ(y)δ′(z)δ(t) ,
Jx(x, t) = 0 ,
Jy(x, t) = 0 ,
Jz(x, t) = −eσzδ(x)δ(y)δ(z)δ′(t) .
(17.6)
The spin operator σz governs the direction of the dipole (which charge moves up the z-axis and
which moves down) and e is the magnitude of the charge. Equation (17.6) obeys the continuity

equation,4 ∇· J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0. We can pre- and postselect the states of the spin to get real
and imaginary weak values ⟨σz⟩w. Then, since this weak value multiplies the charge e, we
effectively couple the electromagnetic ﬁeld to a dipole of real or imaginary strength.
What is the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the dipole? The Hamiltonian H for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld coupled to localized charge and current densities is (in the Coulomb gauge)

with ω = ck; we neglect the ground state energy of the modes. (See Eq. (8.19) and Prob.
8.10.) In the Coulomb gauge, V is not a degree of freedom; it is the instantaneous Coulomb
potential of the charge distribution ρ(x, t). The degrees of freedom are the modes ak. From
Eqs. (17.6–7) we obtain the Heisenberg equation of motion for ak:

k · k = 0), and the transverse part of ˆz is ˆz −ˆk · ˆz ˆk. Hence the
appearance of ˆz −ˆk · ˆz ˆk instead of ˆz in Eq. (17.8). If we assume that ak vanishes for times
t < 0, the solution of Eq. (17.8) is
ak(t) = [−iδ(t) −ωe−iωtΘ(t)]eσz(2π/ℏωL3)1/2(ˆz −ˆk · ˆz ˆk) ,
where Θ(t) is the Heaviside function Θ(t) = 1/2+t/2|t| and dΘ/dt = δ(t). (See Prob. 17.7.)

The minor change from cos(ωt) to i sin(ωt) implies a major change in A(x, t): Eq. (17.12)
shows that A(x, t) is noncausal, i.e. it is nonzero both inside and outside the light cone of
the dipole. The same is true of E(x, t) and B(x, t). For t < 0 the ﬁeld of the imaginary
dipole vanishes everywhere, but for t > 0, it does not vanish anywhere. The imaginary dipole
violates relativistic causality!
This violation is a paradox. We used simple quantum electrodynamics to calculate the
dipole ﬁeld. Quantum electrodynamics is relativistic and causal, so how could the calculation
violate relativistic causality? Perhaps the violation disappears when we average over post-
selections. For example, let the initial spin state be (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩)/
√
2. If the ﬁnal state is
(| ↑⟩+ i| ↓⟩)/
√
2, the weak value of σz is ⟨σz⟩w = i. If the ﬁnal state is (i| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩)/
√
2,
then ⟨σz⟩w = −i and A(x, t) is the negative of Eq. (17.12). Since the probability of both ﬁnal
states is 1/2, the ﬁeld A(x, t) vanishes when we average over them. Yet averaging does not
resolve the paradox of a single imaginary dipole.

17.5
Complex Weak Values

Relativistic causality forbids superluminal messages. Suppose that Alice, in her laboratory,
creates an imaginary dipole via pre- and postselection. Bob, in his laboratory, can measure the
ﬁeld A(x, t) at a spacelike separation from the dipole. Can Alice send a superluminal message
to Bob? She cannot, and the reason is similar to the reason that the Cherenkov radiation of a
charge moving with weak superluminal speed is consistent with causality. (See Sect. 16.7 and
Prob. 16.16.) Alice obtains the weak value ⟨σz⟩w = i only if any measurement that couples to
σz is also weak. If e, the magnitude of the charge, is too large, the Hamiltonian H in Eq. (17.7)
will not contain ⟨σz⟩w in the current Jz(x, t), but rather one of the eigenvalues of σz. Then
any noncausal ﬁeld that Bob measures must be a ﬂuctuation of the vacuum. Indeed, the ﬁeld
and the vacuum are not orthogonal, when both are restricted to the ﬁnite spacetime region that
Bob measures [7]. If e is not too large, then H contains ⟨σz⟩w = i and Bob measures the
noncausal ﬁeld A(x, t) in Eq. (17.12). But Bob cannot tell from his measurements what Alice
did in her laboratory; as far as he knows, the ﬁeld he measures could be a ﬂuctuation of the
vacuum. The nonlocal correlations in A(x, t) show up only when he and Alice compare their
measurements.
Is this resolution complete? The ﬁeld A(x, t) of an imaginary dipole is noncausal, while
the ﬁeld of a real dipole is causal. If noncausal ﬁelds are useless for sending superluminal
messages, why are the ﬁelds of real dipoles causal? The complete resolution of the paradox
takes unitarity into account [8]. In Eq. (17.7), H becomes an effective Hamiltonian Heff
when we substitute ⟨σz⟩w for σz. If ⟨σz⟩w is real, Heff generates unitary evolution. If
⟨σz⟩w is not real, Heff generates nonunitary evolution, which can alter nonlocal correlations.
(See Sect. 16.5 and Probs. 16.9–10.) A simple example involves two photons on a line, with
coordinates x1 and x2, in an entangled state
[ψ(x1)ψ(x2 −L) + ψ(x1 −a)ψ(x2 −L −a)] /
√
2 ,
where 0 < a ≪L; assume ψ(x) vanishes unless x ≈0. Measurements on this state show
x1 ≈0, x2 ≈L or, with equal probability, x1 ≈a, x2 ≈L + a. Suppose the effective
Hamiltonian for the two photons is Heff = ⟨σz⟩wx1, where x1 is the position operator for the
ﬁrst photon. Then the state of the photons at time t is
ei⟨σz⟩wx1t [ψ(x1)ψ(x2 −L) + ψ(x1 −a)ψ(x2 −L −a)] /
√
2 ,
(17.13)
If ⟨σz⟩w is real, the relative phase of the terms in Eq. (17.13) changes over time, but measure-
ments still show x1 ≈0, x2 ≈L or x1 ≈a, x2 ≈L + a with equal probability. But if ⟨σz⟩w
is not real, Eq. (17.13) approaches either ψ(x1)ψ(x2 −L) or ψ(x1 −a)ψ(x2 −L −a). Thus
a complex effective Hamiltonian can change probabilities nonlocally, just as a measurement
on one photon can change probabilities for the other. Neither the complex Hamiltonian nor
the photon measurement violates causality; but applied to entangled states, both can change
probabilities nonlocally. (See also Prob. 3.11.)
This explanation might not seem to apply to the imaginary dipole. The vacuum state |0⟩
is a product state: it is the product of the ground states of all the modes ak,i. But these
ground states are nonlocal (momentum) states, extending over all of space. In a basis of local
(position) states, the vacuum is a highly entangled state. To check that the vacuum is entangled
in position, we can calculate the spatial correlations of A. We deﬁne
A(x1) = π−3/2D−3

e−(x−x1)2/D2A(x)d3x ,
(17.14)

Weak Values and Entanglement
and calculate the vacuum correlation of A(x1) and A(x2). (The vacuum correlation of A(x1)
and A(x2) diverges, hence we consider the correlation of A(x1) and A(x2) instead.) Since
⟨0|A(x1)|0⟩= 0 = ⟨0|A(x2)|0⟩, the vacuum correlation is
⟨0|A(x1)A(x2)|0⟩,
and this vacuum correlation does not vanish as it would if the vacuum were a product of local
position states. (See Prob. 17.10.)

18 The Quantum World
Planck’s 1900 discovery of quanta opened a “quantum century” of fundamental discoveries in
quantum mechanics. Now a second “quantum century” has opened:
In the nineteenth century, life was transformed by the conscious application of clas-
sical mechanics, in the form of Newton’s equations (and, later, thermodynamics), to
the engines of the industrial revolution. In this century, a similar transformation has
been wrought by electromagnetism, in generating and distributing electric power
and communicating words and pictures across the world at the speed of light, in
what should be seen as a conscious application of Maxwell’s equations. It is easy to
predict that in the twenty-ﬁrst century it will be quantum mechanics that inﬂuences
all our lives [1].
This ﬁnal chapter looks back on the ﬁrst quantum century and looks forward, not to applications,
but to fundamental discoveries in the second quantum century.
One fundamental discovery was that many measurements necessarily disturb the measured
system. But measurements of an “eigenoperator” of the system do not; and other measure-
ments that do not disturb the measured system include protective measurements and weak
measurements. (See Chaps. 15–17). One theme of this book is that it is particularly these
measurements – measurements that do not disturb the measured system – that develop our
intuition of quantum mechanics. The weak measurements in the next two sections develop this
intuition further.
A second theme of the book is its demand for simple and physical axioms for quantum
mechanics. Chapter 6 suggests two axioms: causality and nonlocality. Quantum mechanics
may not follow from these two axioms alone. But, starting with Sect. 18.2, this chapter suggests
simple, physical axioms for quantum theory.
18.1
Weak Measurements and Interference
Sections 2.4, 4.1, 15.1 and 16.1 present thought experiments – variations on the two-slit inter-
ference experiment – that challenge complementarity. They get more and more sophisticated,
but they all fail: whenever they show which way the particles go, they fail to show an interfer-
ence pattern, and vice versa. This section presents our most sophisticated thought experiment
yet – and it does not fail! It shows through which slit each particle goes, and it shows an
interference pattern.
The thought experiment includes a weak measurement of an expectation value on a PPS
ensemble. What is the connection between a weak value and an expectation value? Suppose

we have an ensemble of N identical systems in the same initial state |ψ⟩. On this ensemble
we measure ¯A, the average value of an operator A. If A(i) represents the observable A on the
i-th system, then ¯A is
¯A = 1
N
N

i=1
A(i) .
The measurement of ¯A is naturally weak when N is large, for it is a measurement of A/N on
each system. For a weak measurement of ¯A on a PPS ensemble, we postselect the states of
the N systems. We could postselect improbable states. But this time, after the measurement
of ¯A, we merely measure the state of each system in an orthonormal basis |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, . . .
and “postselect” whatever basis state we get. Then, since the pre- and postselected states are
product states, the weak value of ¯A is the average of the weak values of the A(i),
⟨¯A⟩w = 1
N
N

i=1
⟨A(i)⟩w ,
and the weak value ⟨A(i)⟩w depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states of the i-th system. For
some coefﬁcients ck the preselected state of the systems is
|ψ⟩=

k
ck|k⟩,
and we postselect N1 of the systems in the state |1⟩, N2 of the systems in the state |2⟩, and so
on, for some N1 + N2 + · · · = N. The weak value of ¯A is then

Now, the most probable postselected state will have N1 = |c1|2N systems in the state |1⟩,
N2 = |c2|2N systems in the state |2⟩, and so on.1 So from Eq. (18.1) we obtain

as the most probable outcome of the measurement of ¯A; and the larger N, the smaller are the
expected corrections to Eq. (18.2). That is, the weak value of ¯A approaches the expectation
value of A in the initial state |ψ⟩.
This connection between a weak value and an expectation value seems straightforward.
But now consider electrons in a two-slit experiment. The state of each electron at time t = 0,
just as it passes through the screen with the two slits, is cL|L⟩+ cR|R⟩, where |L⟩and |R⟩are
quantum waves emerging from the left and right slits, respectively. At time t = T, the electron

A does not change this probability distribution. For large N, the probability that a
measurement of A(i)/N changes the state of the i-th system is proportional to 1/N2; the probability that it changes
the state of any system is therefore proportional to 1/N, which vanishes in the limit N →∞.

experiment. The row of detectors at the top reveals through

strikes a detector that measures its transverse momentum, thus showing through which slit it
passed. (See Fig. 18.1.) That is, the detector projects the state of each electron onto U(T)|L⟩
or U(T)|R⟩, where U(T) represents time evolution from t = 0 to t = T. At an intermediate
time 0 < t < T we measure weakly an operator ¯A that shows the electron interference pattern.
For example, let A(i) project the transverse position of the i-th electron onto a narrow interval.
Then ¯A = 
i A(i)/N is the fraction of the N electrons passing through that transverse interval.
Applying Eq. (18.2) to this experiment, we ﬁnd that the weak value of ¯A is the expectation value
of A in the state cLU(t)|L⟩+cRU(t)|R⟩; and if the interval is narrow enough, this expectation
value will correspond to a dark or light strip in the two-slit interference pattern. We could map
out the whole interference pattern by transversely moving the interval onto which A projects,
or (for ﬁxed A) by changing the relative phase between U(t)|L⟩and U(t)|R⟩. Either way, we
obtain the interference pattern that corresponds to the state cLU(t)|L⟩+ cRU(t)|R⟩, and we
also observe through which slit each electron passed.
We can simplify the experiment by restricting it to a line (i.e. to the transverse coordinate).
We prepare the ﬁrst electron on a line in the initial state cL|L⟩+ cR|R⟩, where |L⟩is a wave
packet coming from the left, and |R⟩is a wave packet coming from the right with the opposite
momentum. When the two wave packets meet and overlap, we measure their interference
pattern via a weak measurement of A(1)/N, where A(1) projects the state of the ﬁrst electron
to an interval within the overlap region. After the wave packets separate, we check whether the
electron is in the state |L⟩or |R⟩(which way it is moving). We then send in the second electron
in the same initial state, measure A(2)/N, and check whether it is in the state |L⟩or |R⟩; and so
on with the other electrons, until we have measured ⟨¯A⟩on N electrons. We thus measure the
ﬁnal direction of each electron and also the intensity of the superposition cL|L⟩+cR|R⟩in the
interval onto which ¯A projects. By moving this interval and measuring again, we eventually
map out the entire interference pattern.
Is this thought experiment a paradox? On the one hand, the previous thought experiments
conﬁrmed the intuition that “it is impossible to design an apparatus to determine which hole
the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to
destroy the interference pattern” [2]. On the other hand, we have developed the intuition that a
weak measurement on a PPS ensemble tells us about both the pre- and the postselected states

The Quantum World
– here, about the interference pattern and about the ﬁnal direction of motion of each electron.
The thought experiment (which does not contradict any uncertainty relations, either for the
electrons or for the screen) bears out this intuition.
But it is a paradox. Bohr argued that Einstein’s thought experiments in Sect. 2.4 must fail –
and we argued that the thought experiments of Sects. 4.1, 15.1 and 16.1 must fail – if quantum
theory is consistent. How can quantum mechanics be consistent if this experiment succeeds
where the others fail? If each electron passes through one slit, how can there be an interference
pattern? Suppose we insert a line of magnetic ﬂux between the slits. The magnetic ﬂux shifts
the interference pattern. But how can it, if each electron passes only on one side of the ﬂux line?
We might suspect that the weak measurement changes the direction of some of the electrons
but, as noted above, the probability that the state of any electron changes vanishes in the limit
N →∞.
18.2
From Amplitudes to Probabilities
One of the axioms of quantum theory is the Born [3] probability rule: Let A be a Hermitian
operator with eigenvalues ak and corresponding orthonormal eigenstates |k⟩. The probability
that a measurement of A on a system in the state |ψ⟩yields the eigenvalue ak is |⟨k|ψ⟩|2.
(For simplicity we take A nondegenerate.) A number of physicists [4] claim to have derived
this axiom from a weaker axiom, the axiom of collapse: the measurement of A collapses the
state to one of the eigenstates of A. The axiom of collapse is weaker in that it assumes that a
measurement of A on N identical systems prepared in the state |ψ⟩leaves N1 of them in the
state |1⟩, N2 of them in the state |2⟩, and so on; but it does not assume anything else about the
Nk except that N1 + N2 + · · · = N. Other physicists [5] dispute this claim. To test this claim
we analyze [6] here a weak measurement of A.
As in the previous section, we consider an ensemble of N identical systems preselected in
an initial state |ψ⟩, where
|ψ⟩=

k
ck|k⟩
and the |k⟩are an orthonormal basis of states. The only change is that here we assume that the
basis states |k⟩are eigenstates of A:
A|k⟩= ak|k⟩.
The eigenvalues ak are still arbitrary. On these N systems we measure ¯A, which is naturally
weak when N is large:
¯A = 1
N
N

i=1
A(i) ;
again A(i) represents the observable A on the i-th system. For the weak measurement of ¯A we
prepare a measuring device in an initial state |Φd⟩and couple it to the measured systems via
an interaction Hamiltonian Hint,
Hint = g(t)Pd ¯A ,

where [Qd, Pd] = iℏand Qd is the displacement of a pointer on the measuring device. It is
convenient to let g(t) be impulsive and

g(t)dt = 1. After the weak measurement of ¯A we
conclude the experiment with a strong (precise) measurement of A on each system. Again we
postselect whatever we get, so that the postselected state of the systems is a product state with
N1 systems in the state |1⟩, N2 systems in the state |2⟩, and so on, where N1 + N2 + · · · = N.
Immediately after the weak measurement, the state of the measuring device and systems is

the measurement disturbs |Ψin⟩.

The Quantum World
After the weak measurement, the state of the systems collapses to a direct product of
eigenstates of A; the ﬁnal state |Ψfin⟩is a product state of N1 systems in the state |1⟩, N2
systems in the state |2⟩, and so on, where N1 + N2 + · · · = N. What is the state of the
measuring device? On the one hand, Eq. (18.7) implies that the position of the pointer has
changed by ⟨A⟩(if we can neglect the corrections to e−iPd ¯
A/ℏ|Ψin⟩). On the other hand, we
can calculate the shift in the pointer directly from the inner product of |Ψfin⟩and Eq. (18.3)
by applying eiPd ¯
A/ℏto |Ψfin⟩. Since A takes the value a1 on N1 of the systems, the value a2
in N2 of the systems, and so on, the pointer shifts by (N1a1 + N2a2 + . . . )/N. These two
calculations of the shift must agree, hence
N1
N a1 + N2
N a2 + · · · = |c1|2a1 + |c2|2a2 + . . . ;
and since the eigenvalues a1, a2, . . . of A are arbitrary, we conclude that N1/N = |c1|2,
N2/N = |c2|2, and so on. The fraction Nk/N of systems on which a measurement of A yields
ak approaches |ck|2 in the limit N →∞, and we recover the Born probability rule.
But can we neglect of the corrections to e−iPd ¯
A/ℏ|Ψ⟩? If, for example, N1 = N in the
ﬁnal state, we do not recover the Born probability rule. The inner product of this ﬁnal state
with the corrections does not vanish. On the contrary: for ﬁnal states |Ψfin⟩that violate the
Born rule, the inner product
N

i=1
⟨Ψfin|Ψ⊥

N
(18.8)
does not vanish for large N; instead of cancelling one another, the terms in the sum add
coherently and Eq. (18.8) is proportional to
√
N. (See Prob. 18.1.)
Thus the axiom of collapse is not sufﬁcient. What we require is an axiom of stable collapse.
Our thought experiment proceeds from an initial state |Ψin⟩⊗|Φd⟩via a weak measurement
of ¯A to projection onto |Ψfin⟩. An arbitrarily small perturbation of the initial state should not
induce a measurable change in ¯A. (If it did, we could never measure ¯A, for an arbitrarily small
perturbation of the initial state would change the result of the measurement.) Thus we must
assume that the variation in the measured value of ¯A due to the variation
|Ψin⟩→(1 + ϵ2)−1/2 
|Ψin⟩+ ϵ|Ψ⊥
in⟩

vanishes as ϵ vanishes, for any normalized |Ψ⊥
in⟩orthogonal to |Ψin⟩.
Now consider the initial state |Ψin⟩= |ψ⟩1 ⊗· · · ⊗|ψ⟩N expanded in an orthonormal
basis of eigenstates of A(1), A(2), . . . , A(N) i.e. in an orthonormal basis of such states as
|3⟩1 ⊗|5⟩2 ⊗· · ·⊗|2⟩N, etc. For every such basis state there is a set of values for N1, N2, . . . .
Let |ΨT
in⟩be a truncation of |Ψin⟩to basis states which have Ni = c∗
i ciN + O(
√
N) for all
i. For N large enough, |ΨT
in⟩is an arbitrarily small perturbation of |Ψin⟩, yet |ΨT
in⟩projects
onto only those ﬁnal states |Ψfin⟩that are consistent with the Born rule. (See Prob. 9.5.) The
axiom of stable collapse then implies that also in our thought experiment, with |Ψin⟩and not
|ΨT
in⟩as the initial state, the ﬁnal state |Ψfin⟩must be consistent with the Born rule. Thus we
obtain the Born rule from a weaker axiom, the axiom of stable collapse.

The Fate of the Universe
Chapter 9 presents the paradox of Schr¨odinger’s cat, and some proposed resolutions. These
resolutions, while consistent with experiment, are overgrown with redundant physical quanti-
ties. Can we apply Occam’s razor to the overgrowth? The most overgrown resolution is the
Many Worlds interpretation, with its inﬁnity of worlds. Other resolutions add assumptions to
quantum theory without adding anything to its predictions. Collapse and hidden variables re-
solve the paradox by completing quantum theory (if quantum theory is incomplete) but no one
has observed collapse,2 and hidden variables are in principle unobservable. These additional
assumptions are reminiscent of the aether assumption; like the aether, collapse and hidden
variables seem to have a place in theory, but no place in experiment. (See Sect. 1.4.)
A different way to resolve the paradox is to impose ﬁnal boundary conditions on the
universe. (See Sects. 9.4 and 10.5.) In effect, we impose ﬁnal boundary conditions on the
Many Worlds interpretation, to postselect just one world. In the Many Worlds interpretation,
a world is a macroscopic state of all measuring devices, relative to a state of all measured
systems; now we impose a ﬁnal boundary condition by postselecting a macroscopic state.
Why postselect a single macroscopic state? We could postselect a superposition of macroscopic
states. For example, we could postselect a superposition of two macroscopic states, and get a
“Two Worlds” interpretation of quantum theory. However, we have no reason to select such a
superposition, for it would decohere. (See Sect. 9.4.) Recall the role that decoherence plays
– what it can do and what it cannot do. Decoherence reduces an entangled state of measuring
devices, measured systems, and their environment to a mixture of macroscopic states, i.e. to
a mixture of states in which pointers all have well deﬁned positions. Decoherence can thus
determine the basis in which an entangled state reduces to a mixture. Decoherence cannot
select a state (an actual measurement outcome) from the mixture (of possible measurement
outcomes). But ﬁnal boundary conditions can do that.
The paradoxes of Sect. 14.1, as well, motivate ﬁnal boundary conditions. Figure 14.4
shows two particles in a singlet state |Ψ−⟩= (| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩)/
√
2. Alice, at spacetime point
a, measures the spin component of one of them along some axis. In the Lorentz frame of
Fig. 14.4, Alice’s measurement ﬁxes the spin component of the other particle at b. But in the
Lorentz frame of Fig. 14.5, b precedes a; hence the spin component of the particle at b ﬁxes the
spin component of Alice’s particle before she measures it. This paradox suggests that Alice’s
measurement at a is a future boundary condition on her particle before a.
So let two states describe the universe [7]. Formally, we have an initial or history state
|Ψhis⟩at time tin and a ﬁnal or destiny state |Ψdes⟩at time tfin as the initial and ﬁnal boundary
conditions on the universe. The times tin and tfin need not be the initial and ﬁnal times of
cosmology. Since the time evolution of |Ψhis⟩and |Ψdes⟩is unitary, tin can be any time before
the ﬁrst measurement and tfin can be any time after the last measurement. Let us choose, as
an example of a history state at time tin, a product of a single spin-1/2 state a| ↑⟩+ b| ↓⟩, an
initial state |0⟩d of a measuring device, and an initial state |0⟩env of their environment. At time
2The SL and CSL models make testable predictions that differ from the predictions of quantum mechanics. (See
Sect. 9.2.) Experiments have not conﬁrmed these predictions; but if future experiments do so, the conclusion of this
paragraph will be invalid.

t1 the measuring device measures the spin state; the history state becomes
|Ψhis(t1)⟩= a| ↑⟩⊗| ↑⟩d ⊗|0⟩env + b| ↓⟩⊗| ↓⟩d ⊗|0⟩env ,
where the states | ↑⟩d and | ↓⟩d of the measuring device correspond to the outcome of the
measurement. (To simplify the example, we suppose that the only nonzero terms in the Hamil-
tonian are the terms for the interaction of the measuring device with the spin and with the
environment.) The measuring device, which is macroscopic, is not isolated from the environ-
ment; after a short decoherence time it becomes entangled with the environment, so that at
some later time t2, the history state is
|Ψhis(t2)⟩= a| ↑⟩⊗| ↑⟩d ⊗| ↑⟩env + b| ↓⟩⊗| ↓⟩d ⊗| ↓⟩env ,
where now the states | ↑⟩env and | ↓⟩env of the environment show the dependence of the
environment on the outcome of the measurement. The states | ↑⟩env and | ↓⟩env represent
the degrees of freedom of the environment, which are beyond experimental control.
All
informatiom about the relative phase of | ↑⟩d and | ↓⟩d is lost via decoherence of these degrees
of freedom. Thus decoherence determines the basis of macroscopic states | ↑⟩d and | ↓⟩d of
the mixture that evolves from the measurement. For the destiny state at time tfin > t2 we
deﬁne
|Ψdes⟩= | ↑⟩d ⊗| ↑⟩env .
The destiny state determines the states of the measuring device and the environment, i.e. the
statesthatrecordtheoutcomeofthemeasurementattimet2. (Forsimplicity, wecanassumethat
the measuring device is not used again after time t2.) The destiny state selects from the history
state at time t2 just the state | ↑⟩d ⊗| ↑⟩env of the measuring device and the environment. (The
ﬁnal state of the spin may depend on subsequent interactions with other measuring devices.)
In this way, ﬁnal boundary conditions on the universe complete the account of the measuring
process.
The previous section discusses the axiom of stable collapse. If this axiom holds, quantum
measurements will follow the Born rule. If it does not hold, measurements will not always
follow the Born rule. (See Prob. 18.2.) So a failure of the Born rule would be evidence for
unstable collapse and “improbable” ﬁnal boundary conditions. Also, if weak measurements
on a preselected, but not postselected, ensemble yield weak values, we would interpret them
as evidence for “improbable” ﬁnal boundary conditions.
The two-state formalism is a minimal resolution of the paradox of Schr¨odinger’s cat. It does
not require a collapse mechanism. It simply equalizes the status of initial and ﬁnal boundary
conditions on the universe. We conclude from the discussion in Sect. 10.5, however, that
the ﬁnal boundary conditions are qualitatively different from the initial boundary conditions.
The state |Ψdes(tfin)⟩records, in one fashion or another, the result of every measurement
ever made. The record could include pointers on measuring devices, notations in a laboratory
notebook, and memories. The records could even be lost; but under unitary time evolution, no
information is lost. Thus in |Ψdes(tfin)⟩, systems that once interacted and have since separated
remain entangled. By contrast, initial boundary conditions do not record anything; the initial
state |Ψhis(tin)⟩is not entangled. The evolution is reversible, but not symmetric, in time.

18.4
The Role of ℏ
273
Final boundary conditions resolve also the paradox of Lorentz invariance and collapse.
(See Chap. 14.) In the two-state formalism, uncertainty about the outcome of a measurement
is due to our ignorance of ﬁnal boundary conditions. Hence our ignorance about the outcome
of a measurement is like our ignorance about how a coin falls – “heads” or “tails” – before we
look at it. There is no nonlocal collapse, because there is no collapse (only a ﬁnal boundary
condition); consequently, there is also no conﬂict with Lorentz invariance. This resolution of
the paradoxes of Chaps. 9 and 14 extends automatically to relativistic quantum theory.
This resolution is consistent with causality only because most of |Ψdes⟩is unknown, most
of the time. In this respect, the two-state formalism is similar to Bohm’s theory of hidden
variables. Bohm’s hidden variables must be hidden because otherwise we could use them to
send superluminal signals. Similarly, if the destiny state were not partly hidden, we could
send superluminal signals. For example, let Alice and Bob share a pair of spins in the state
(| ↑⟩A ⊗| ↑⟩B +| ↓⟩A ⊗| ↓⟩B)/
√
2, where | ↑⟩A, | ↓⟩A are states of a spin in Alice’s
laboratory and | ↑⟩B, | ↓⟩B are states of a spin in Bob’s. Alice and Bob adopt the following
protocol: at time t = 0 (as they measure time) Alice may or may not ﬂip her spin. Next, Bob
checks whether his spin is in the state | ↑⟩B or | ↓⟩B. Suppose that the destiny state shows the
subsequent state of their spins to be | ↑⟩A ⊗(| ↑⟩B + | ↓⟩B)/
√
2. If Alice could anticipate this
part of the destiny state, she could deliberately change the outcome of Bob’s measurement by
ﬂipping her spin; thus she could send Bob a superluminal signal. From this example we see
that causality requires the destiny state to be at least partly hidden.
The two-state formalism and Bohm’s theory of hidden variables share another property:
determinism. But the determinism of the two-state formalism is radically different from de-
terminism as usually understood, for while |Ψhis⟩evolves deterministically forward in time,
|Ψdes⟩evolves deterministically backward in time. Neither |Ψhis⟩nor |Ψdes⟩alone has any
effect; an effect is the product of causal chains that extend from both the future and the past.
In this formalism, old paradoxes of free will and determinism have a new solution. On the one
hand, free will has to mean that our choices are not determined by our past. What is free will,
if not freedom from the past? Such freedom has a place in the two-state formalism, because
the history state |Ψhis⟩by itself indeed does not determine the present. On the other hand, no
one can expect to be free of the future. In the two-state formalism the past does not determine
the future, yet the future is determined. This juxtaposition of free will and determinism recalls
the classic Hebrew aphorism, “All is foreseen, yet choice is given” [8]; see also the work of
Price [9].
18.4
The Role of h--
In searching for simple, physical axioms for quantum theory, we work from within quantum
theory and from without. From within quantum theory, we seek a mechanics that directly
expresses its physical content; and from without, we seek axioms that imply, directly or indi-
rectly, just this physical content. In this section we work from within, formulating a mechanics
in which modular variables play a role; in Sect. 18.6 we work from without, ﬁnding axioms
that imply modular variables in this role.
Can there be a quantum theory without quantum states? Every quantum state is the eigen-
state of some operators; we can therefore map a state to a set of operators. Now consider the

274
18
The Quantum World
set of all Hermitian eigenoperators of a state |ψ⟩, i.e. all Hermitian operators having |ψ⟩as an
eigenstate. The set is algebraically closed in the sense that if Aψ and A′
ψ are eigenoperators
of the state |ψ⟩, then so are Aψ + A′
ψ and AψA′
ψ. The unique eigenstate of all the operators in
this set is |ψ⟩. (See Prob. 18.3.) In this sense, we can replace |ψ⟩with the set of all Aψ. We
can also deﬁne the set of all operators that transform |ψ⟩to a state orthogonal to |ψ⟩. These
two sets span the space of all operators.
The equation of motion for Aψ is the Heisenberg equation of motion
dAψ
dt
= i
ℏ[H, Aψ] + ∂Aψ
∂t
,
(18.9)
so the value of Aψ at one time determines its value at all times. Once measured, the Aψ are
known at all times; the operators in the second set are unknown at all times, because they all
transform |ψ⟩into some state orthogonal to |ψ⟩and so their expectation values in the state
|ψ⟩all vanish. The set of completely known operators is maximal in that any operator that
commutes with all the Aψ is already in the set.
Suppose now that the only observables that we measure, on a system in the state |ψ⟩, are
the eigenoperators Aψ, i.e. those for which the eigenvalues are (or will be) completely known.
If we restrict ourselves to observables in this set, we never disturb the measured system and
there is no uncertainty in our measurements. The evolution of the operators is completely
deterministic. The boundary conditions on this evolution are just the eigenvalues of the Aψ,
so there is no longer any need for the state of the system. Thus, by restricting measurements
to the maximal set of Aψ, we eliminate states, uncertainties and probabilities from quantum
theory. The restriction to measurements of the Aψ is, of course, artiﬁcial. We might guess
that there is no quantum theory left in this restricted theory; there is no collapse, and all that
remains of the dynamics is the equation of motion, Eq. (18.9), which is the formal analogue of
the classical equation of motion. Yet this restricted theory will surprise us: it is still quantum
theory!
To see how the restricted theory works, consider a Hamiltonian H for a spinning particle
constrained to the z-axis:
H = p2
z/2m −g(t)µSzBz .
For simplicity we take g(t) to be impulsive: g(t) vanishes except for a brief time interval
0 ≤t ≤T when it equals 1/T. During this interval the magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis equals
Bz, where B (like µ) is a constant.3 The equations of motion obtained from H are
dz/dt = pz/m ,
dpz/dt = g(t)µSzB ,
and
dSx/dt = g(t)µBzSy ,
dSy/dt = −g(t)µBzSx ,
dSz/dt = 0 .
If T is small, we can neglect the change in z during the interval 0 ≤t ≤T and calculate
pz(T) = µSzB + pz(0)
(18.10)
3As in Sect. 7.2, the magnetic ﬁeld must fringe away from the z-axis so as to satisfy Maxwell’s equation ∇· B = 0.

18.4
The Role of ℏ
275
and
Sx(T) = Sx(0) cos(µBz) + Sy(0) sin(µBz) ,
Sy(T) = Sy(0) cos(µBz) −Sx(0) sin(µBz) ;
(18.11)
Sz does not change. Suppose that pz(0) is an approximate eigenoperator with eigenvalue 0,
and ∆pz(0) is small. Consider two possible initial boundary conditions for the spin. On one
hand, if Sz(T) = Sz(0) is one of the known observables, then from Eq. (18.10) we conclude
that the particle accelerates in the direction of its spin, like atoms in a Stern-Gerlach apparatus.
Equations (18.11) say nothing since Sx(0) and Sy(0) are completely unknown. On the other
hand, if Sx(0) is a known observable, we solve Eqs. (18.11) for Sx(0) to obtain
Sx(0) = Sx(T) cos(µBz) −Sy(T) sin(µBz) .
(18.12)
Equation (18.12) indicates correlations between the modular position zmod = z mod 2π/µB
and the spin components Sx(T) and Sy(T). For example, if at time T we ﬁnd the particle
at one of the points zmod = 0, we are sure to ﬁnd Sx(T) = Sx(0). If at time T we ﬁnd the
particle at one of the points zmod = π/4µB, we are sure to ﬁnd Sx(T) −Sy(T) =
√
2Sx(0).
But so far the motion is classical, whether we choose Sz(0) or Sx(0) as the known observable.
The surprise comes when we consider modular angular momentum. The operator
eiπ(Lx+Sx)/ℏ
(18.13)
effects a rotation of π around the x-axis. This rotation, which sends z →−z, pz →−pz
and Sz →−Sz, commutes with H and is thus a constant of the motion. It does not commute
with Sz, so if Sz(0) is one of the known observables, then the modular angular momentum
(Lx + Sx) mod 2ℏis completely unknown. But it does commute with Sx, so if Sx(0) is one
of the known observables, then the modular angular momentum is known at all times.
Modular angular momentum is an observable with no classical analogue; it reveals nonlocal
relative phases. For example, we know from Eq. (18.10) that pz(T) and Sz are correlated in
sign, for pz(T) = pz(T) −pz(0) = µSzB. But how do we know, if we measure Sx(0) and
not Sz, about the relative phase between terms with different values of Sz and pz? We can
rephrasethequestionbyreturningforamomenttotheSchr¨odingerformulationandspecializing
to spin-1/2. The initial state of the particle (up to normalization) is
ψ+(z, 0) = e−z2/2(∆z)2 (| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩) ,
where ∆z is large. It evolves in time T to a superposition of two waves:
ψ+(z, T) = e−z2/2(∆z)2+iµBz/ℏ| ↑⟩+ e−z2/2(∆z)2−iµBz/ℏ| ↓⟩.
The superposed waves separate for t > T. How do we know, in our restricted theory, that the
relative phase between the two terms in ψ+(z, T) is + and not −as in the orthogonal state
ψ−(z, T) = e−z2/2(∆z)2+iµBz/ℏ| ↑⟩−e−z2/2(∆z)2−iµBz/ℏ| ↓⟩
?
The answer is that the rotation operator of Eq. (18.13), which depends on the modular angular
momentum (Lx + Sx) mod 2ℏ, reveals the relative phase. For all t, the modular angular

276
18
The Quantum World
momentum of ψ+(z, t) equals ℏ/2, while the modular angular momentum of ψ−(z, T) equals
−ℏ/2. Thus even this restricted theory, with its deterministic measurements, contains nonlocal
quantum phases!
As long as ℏis nonzero, the theory contains nonlocal quantum phases. In the limit ℏ→
0, modular angular momentum becomes undeﬁned; the limit of Eq. (18.13) is undeﬁned.
No matter what boundary conditions we impose, modular angular momentum is completely
unknown in this limit. The limit, then, gives us a new way to look at ℏ. The role of ℏis
not quantitative (to measure uncertainty) but qualitative: ℏshows which observables become
undeﬁned in the classical limit.
18.5
Causality and Nonlocality as Axioms
Chapter 6 suggests two simple, physical axioms for quantum theory: relativistic causality and
nonlocality. Does quantum theory follow from just these two axioms? This question gets
us into a difﬁculty. The difﬁculty is that in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, c cannot be
a bound on the speed of signalling. We could try to derive relativistic quantum mechanics
from these two axioms, but we get into another difﬁculty: relativistic quantum theory does not
correspond satisfactorily to what experiments can measure. (See Sect. 11.5 and Chap. 14.) It
makes more sense to try ﬁrst to derive nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, as Chap. 6 suggests.
But if we take the c →∞limit of relativistic causality, we seem to be left with nothing – no
limit on the speed of signalling.
Actually, the nonrelativistic theory itself shows the way out of the difﬁculty. Nonlocal
quantum correlations are useless for signalling. (See Prob. 3.11.) Indeed, they must be useless
for signalling. Consider two systems entangled in their internal degrees of freedom. The
nonlocal correlations between the systems do not depend on their spatial separation; hence if
the correlations were useful for signalling, they would be useful for superluminal signalling,
too. So the causality constraint is more severe in the nonrelativistic limit: all signalling, not just
superluminal signalling, is forbidden. Of course, signalling via local interactions (e.g. causal
propagation of a ﬁeld) is allowed, but signalling via any nonlocal interactions is forbidden. We
can therefore reformulate the two axioms of Chap. 6 as follows:
i) Any nonlocal interactions are useless for signalling.
ii) Some interactions are nonlocal.
We must still deﬁne nonlocal interactions. What nonlocal interactions ﬁt the second axiom
best: Nonlocal correlations? Nonlocal equations of motion?
Suppose ﬁrst that nonlocality means nonlocal correlations. Local correlations obey the
CHSH inequality, Eq. (3.12). Namely, the sum of correlations
SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′) = C(A, B) + C(A′, B) + C(A, B′) −C(A′, B′)
satisﬁes |SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′)| ≤2 if the correlations C(A, B), etc. are local. The sum can
be as large as 2
√
2 if the correlations are quantum correlations [10]. Yet arbitrary correlations
could yield a sum |SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′)| as large as 4. Why does quantum mechanics limit
the sum to 2
√
2? Let’s make a conjecture: the only way that |SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′)| can

18.5
Causality and Nonlocality as Axioms
277
exceed 2
√
2 is if the correlations violate causality. This conjecture, if true, would allow us
to derive at least a part of quantum mechanics. We could deduce that, in order to satisfy the
axiom of nonlocality (in the sense of nonlocal correlations), the sum |SCHSH(A, B; A′, B′)|
would have to exceed 2 for some A, B, A′ and B′; but in order to satisfy the axiom of causality,
|SCHSH(A, A′; B, B′)| could not exceed 2
√
2. But a simple counterexample disproves the
conjecture [11]. (See Prob. 18.5.) Deriving the 2
√
2 limit from causality requires additional
axioms [12].
Suppose now that nonlocality means nonlocal equations of motion. Are quantum equations
of motion the only nonlocal equations of motion consistent with relativistic causality? Here,
too, there is a counterexample, called jamming. In jamming, Alice and Bob jointly measure
nonlocal correlations between two spacetime points a and b, respectively. But Jim (the jammer)
can act at a spacetime point j to change their nonlocal correlations into local correlations.
Jamming is nonlocal, but it is consistent with relativistic causality if a, b and j obey certain
conditions [13]. (See Prob. 18.6.) So quantum mechanics is not the only theory combining
causality with action at a distance.
Still, we continue the search for simple, physical axioms for quantum mechanics. So far
we have discussed nonlocality in space. Bohm’s theory of hidden variables, for example,
is nonlocal across the spacelike separation between Bob’s measurements and Alice’s; the
variables must be hidden to obey causality. The next section postulates a special form of action
at a distance as the axiom of nonlocality. However, the ﬁnal boundary conditions of Sect. 18.3
are hidden variables that are nonlocal in time. Section 18.3 shows that these nonlocal variables,
as well, obey causality only if they are hidden. How does a theory combine causality with
nonlocality in time?
Section 16.2 presents a thought experiment in which weak measurements of the kinetic
energy of a particle consistently yield negative values. The thought experiment includes a ﬁnal
boundary condition – postselection of the particle far from the potential well in which it is
initially bound. Instead of a postselection, we can follow the weak measurement of kinetic
energy with a new and more precise measurement of kinetic energy (as Salviati points out in
Sect. 16.8). If we do, the measured values are very likely to be positive. The fact that we may
conclude the experiment with either a postselection or a new measurement of kinetic energy
implies that there must be uncertainty in the measuring device and the measured system. That
is, suppose the measuring device does not introduce uncertainty into the measured values.
Then the scatter in (positive and negative) measured values must arise from uncertainty in the
measured system. But even if the measuring device introduces uncertainty, there must also be
uncertainty in the measured system. Otherwise, postselection on the measured system could
not change the distribution of values measured by the device. Thus nonlocality in time implies
fundamental uncertainty.
This derivation of uncertainty is qualitative, but a quantitative derivation may be possible as
well. How much uncertainty is needed for nonlocality in time to be consistent with causality?
The question remains open. We see again, however, that the positive in quantum mechanics
hides behind the negative. Quantum uncertainty is not pointless “playing with dice”, as Einstein
put it; quantum uncertainty is the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for time symmetry and
causality to coexist.

The Quantum World
18.6
Causality, Nonlocality and Scaling
Section 6.1 describes a piston in a long, closed cylinder with a particle in it. A little ball
collides twice with the piston from the outside, pushing the piston inward. According to
classical mechanics, only if the particle inside hits the piston does the ball affect it. But
according to quantum mechanics, the ball affects the particle, even when there is no explicit
interaction between them: it changes the modular energy of the particle. The particle does
not, however, affect the ball. For our axiom of nonlocality, let us construct a model with the
same nonlocal interaction. Let us assume that the ball changes the probability distribution of
the energy of the particle, although there is no explicit interaction between the ball and the
particle; we do not assume anything about how the distribution changes, just that it changes.
The probability distribution of the energy of the ball, however, does not change.
According to our axiom of causality, the nonlocal interaction must be useless for signalling.
But if the ball can affect the particle, why can’t two observers, Alice and Bob, use it to send
signals? If Bob, standing near the piston, scatters a ball off the piston, can’t Alice, standing at
the other end of the cylinder, observe a change in the probability distribution of the energy of
the particle? Section 6.4 hints how to avoid a violation of causality: the axioms are compatible
if and only if uncertainty keeps Alice from detecting the effect of the ball on the particle.
Let us apply a mathematical statement proved in Sect. 6.3. Let ρb and ρp denote the
probability distributions for the energies of the ball and the particle, respectively, and ρbp the
probability distribution for their total energy. The distribution of total energy is a convolution
of ρb and ρp:
ρbp(E) =

ρp(E −E′)ρb(E′)dE′ .
(18.14)
We assume conservation of total energy, hence ρbp(E) never changes. We also assume that
the ball affects ρp(E −E′) without the particle affecting ρb(E′), so ρp(E′) is the only energy
distribution thatchanges. ThesamemustbetrueoftheFouriertransformsofthesedistributions:
˜ρp(t) changes, but not ˜ρbp(t) or ˜ρb(t). From the Fourier transform of Eq. (18.14),
˜ρbp(t) = ˜ρp(t)˜ρb(t) ,
(18.15)
we see that for ˜ρp(t) alone to change, without any change in ˜ρb(t) and ˜ρbp(t), both ˜ρb(t) and
˜ρbp(t) must vanish over some interval in t. From Eq. (18.15) we then conclude, ﬁrst, that the
ball changes the modular energy of the particle (since the Fourier transform ˜ρp(t) represents the
distribution of modular energy); and second, that the modular energy of the ball is completely
unknown (since the Fourier transform ˜ρb(t) vanishes). If the modular energy of the ball is
completely unknown, the change in modular energy of the particle does not correspond to any
measurable change in the modular energy of the ball. Then the ball can affect the particle
without the particle affecting the ball.
In quantum mechanics, the t in ˜ρp(t), ˜ρb(t) and ˜ρbp(t) necessarily represents time. (See
Eq. 6.10.) Here t has (so far) nothing to do with time. Can we deduce that t represents time?
We need an additional axiom. Ideally, we would like an axiom that connects energy and
time and holds both in classical and quantum mechanics. We note the following: Let H be
a Hamiltonian for a system and O be any dynamical variable of the system. If we scale the

18.6
Causality, Nonlocality and Scaling
279
Hamiltonian by a factor λ, so that H →λH, then – whether the equation of motion for O
follows from a Poisson bracket or a commutator – the corresponding scaling for dO/dt is
dO/dt →λdO/dt. Let this be our third axiom: for any system, time derivatives of dynamical
variables scale the same way as the Hamiltonian.
As an application of this axiom, let us compare two cases. In the ﬁrst case, the probability
distribution of the ball is ρb(E). In the second case, the probability distribution is ρ′
b(E), scaled
by a factor λ relative to the ﬁrst case:4
ρ′
b(E) = 1
λρb (E/λ) .
(18.16)
If, in the ﬁrst case, the time between the two collisions of the ball with the piston is T, what
is the time between the two collisions in the second case? In the second case it is T ′ = T/λ,
because the time evolution is faster by a factor λ.
Now let us compare the Fourier transforms of these probability distributions. The Fourier
transform of ρb(E) is
˜ρb(t) = (2π)−1/2

ρb(E)eiEtdE .
The Fourier transform 0of ρ′
b(E) is
˜ρ′
b(t) = (2π)−1/2

ρ′
b(E)eiEtdE
= (2π)−1/2

ρb(E/λ)ei(E/λ)λt/kdE/λ
= ˜ρb(λt) .
(18.17)
What does Eq. (18.17) tell us? It tells us how to compare modular energy scales. The scale
for ˜ρ′
b(t) is compressed by a factor λ compared to the scale for ˜ρb(t). In particular, suppose
that ˜ρb(t) vanishes for all t > t0. Equation (18.17) then implies that ˜ρ′
b(t) vanishes for all
t > t0/λ. In terms of modular energy, if in the case of ρb(E) the modular energy E mod E0
is completely uncertain for all E0 < 2π/t0, then in the case of ρ′
b(E) the modular energy E
mod E0 is completely uncertain for all E0 < 2πλ/t0 = 2π(T/t0)/T ′ (since λ = T/T ′). If
we ﬁx T and deﬁne a constant k = T/t0, then the modular energy E mod E0 is completely
uncertain for all E0 < 2πk/T ′.
We thus obtain an uncertainty relation for energy and time. For if E mod E0 is completely
uncertain, then the uncertainty ∆E in energy cannot be less than E0. Thus the minimum
uncertainty in the energy is related to the time T ′ between the two collisions of the ball by
∆E ≥2πk/T ′, or
T ′∆E ≥2πk .
(18.18)
Equation (18.18) has the form of the uncertainty relation for energy and time in quantum
theory. (See Sects. 8.1 and 8.5.) But is the constant k universal? This question takes us back
to Sects. 2.3–4 and the Bohr-Einstein debate. It might seem that Eq. (18.18) holds only when
4The normalization is the same:

ρb(E)dE.

The Quantum World
the energy distribution of the ball has the special form ρ′
b(E), deﬁned in Eq. (18.16), for some
value of λ. But Eq. (18.18) is a consequence of the axiom of causality: it prevents signalling
between systems that do not interact locally. It must therefore hold for all possible energy
distributions of the ball; otherwise we could defeat the axiom of causality, as it applies to
one distribution, with another distribution. The Bohr-Einstein debate shows that uncertainty
relations hold consistently only if they hold universally. The theory that follows from our three
axioms can be consistent only if the constant k is the same for all energy distributions. Since
the ball could arrive at the piston after colliding with any other system, the constant k in the
uncertainty relation Eq. (18.18) must be universal, and we can identify k with ℏ. Our three
axioms thus imply at least a part of quantum theory.
18.7
What is the Quantum World?
The title of this chapter is “The Quantum World”. If Bohr could have reviewed the book,
he might [14] (or might not [15]) have objected, “There is no quantum world. There is only
an abstract quantum physical description.” There is no quantum world independent of our
measurements.
But – to paraphrase Maslow [16] – if our only tool is a hammer, we tend to treat everything
as if it were a nail. If our only tool were a hammer, not even the classical world would be
independent of our measurements. This book proposes measurements that do not hammer at
the quantum world, and claims that the quantum world is independent of them. Let us brieﬂy
review these measurements.
If a system is in an eigenstate |ψ⟩of an observable A, a measurement of A on the sys-
tem yields an eigenvalue of A and the measurement does not disturb the measured system.
Section 18.4 makes the most of such measurements by deﬁning the set of all observables Aψ
having |ψ⟩as an eigenstate, and considering measurements of the Aψ only. If we measure only
eigenoperators of |ψ⟩, there is no uncertainty in our measurements and we never disturb the
measured system. We might expect that nothing quantum could come out of these measure-
ments. Yet among the operators Aψ are modular variables; as Chaps. 5 and 6 show, modular
variables represent nonlocal quantum phases. In the limit ℏ→0 modular variables are com-
pletely undeﬁned. Hence the classical limit ℏ→0 is not a limit in which all observables are
well deﬁned, although conjugate variables are well deﬁned. For ℏ̸= 0, conjugate variables do
not commute but modular variables are well deﬁned; and measurements of modular variables
exhibit quantum nonlocality, part of the quantum world that other measurements miss.
If |ψ⟩is not an eigenstate of an operator A, we can still measure A in a protective measure-
ment. In such a measurement, the coupling between A and the measured system is weak and |ψ⟩
is protected from any disturbance due to this weak coupling. The protection may, for example,
consist of many measurements of |ψ⟩⟨ψ| during the measurement of A. As Sect. 15.3 shows,
the measurement yields ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, the average of A measured on an ensemble of systems in the
state |ψ⟩. Indeed, a protective measurement on a single system yields ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. The operator
A is arbitrary; hence we can measure every relevant observable on a single system. Quantum
theory is not merely a set of rules for calculating probabilities. Protective measurements show
that the magnitude and phase of quantum waves, and expectation values such as ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩and

|⟨a|b⟩|2 (i.e. the expectation value of |b⟩⟨b| in the state |a⟩) have physical meaning independent
of probabilities.
Weak measurements generalize protective measurements.
In weak measurements, the
coupling is weak; but a weak measurement of A involves preselection of a state |ψin⟩and
postselection of a state |ψfin⟩. These states deﬁne a pre- and postselected (PPS) ensemble,
and the measured value, the weak value ⟨A⟩w, has the form ⟨ψfin|A|ψin⟩/⟨ψfin|ψin⟩. Weak
values lead us to reinterpret the role of time in quantum mechanics. For if a weak value
describes a quantum system between two times, then the future of a quantum system must
contain information about its present that is not available in its past. We come to describe
quantum systems via two states, one evolving forwards from the past and the other evolving
backwards from the future, as in Sect. 18.3.
The time symmetry in this new formalism is elegant, but it is not only elegant: time
symmetry is crucial for the deﬁnition of the quantum world. It is time symmetry that allows
us to couple a measuring device to an independent quantum system, as the “quantum walk” of
Sect. 16.6 shows. During a weak measurement, the measured system and measuring device
evolve together to a highly entangled state, Eq. (16.21). Without postselection there is no way to
disentangle the entanglement of the measured system and measuring device, hence no quantum
world. With postselection, however, the measuring device measures a single value – the weak
value – that depends only on the measured system and not on the measuring device. (See
Eqs. (16.22–24).) With postselection, there is no superposition of pointer positions; there is
no need to monitor quantum phases in the measuring device. The measuring device decouples
from the measured system, and we can, with Bohr, treat it as classical.
•
Such is the world to which quantum paradoxes have led us. And after all, we look forward
to an application: may this book inspire readers to confront paradox creatively, “to think for
themselves, to unmask false arguments and ambiguous phrases” [17] in the world, and to grasp
the world more fully by grasping it gently.

The Quantum World
Consider a weak measurement of ¯A = 
i A(i)/N on this initial state (where A(i)
represents the operator A on the i-th system) assuming that the time evolution operator
for the systems, over the duration of the measurement, is e−iPd ¯
A/ℏ. (As usual, Pd is
conjugate to the position Qd of the pointer on a measuring device.) Show that the state
of the systems immediately after the weak measurement, up to terms of order 1/N 2,
is

the state |ψ⟩.
(c) Now assume that, immediately following the weak measurement, an exact mea-
surement of A on each system yields N1 of the systems in the state |1⟩and N2 in
the state |2⟩. Show that if N1 = N or N2 = N, then all the terms in the sum in
Eq. (18.19) add constructively and the time evolution operator moves the pointer by 1
or -1, respectively. Show that the terms in the sum cancel out in the limit N →∞if
and only if N1/N = c∗
1c1 in the same limit.
18.2 Consider an ensemble of N identical systems in the pre- and postselected states
|Ψin⟩= | ↑⟩,
|Ψfin⟩=

The Hamiltonian of these systems does not depend on spin. On each system in this
PPS ensemble we measure the operator

,
each time choosing the unit vector n at random. In the limit N →∞, what probability
distribution describes these measurements? Show that the probability of obtaining spin
parallel to n is not cos2(θ/2) (as it would be without postselection) but
cos2(θ/2)
1 + cos φ sin θ
1 + cos φ sin θ cos θ .
18.3 Let |ψ⟩be a state in an n-dimensional complex vector space with n > 2. Show that
every Hermitian eigenoperator Aψ of |ψ⟩is a real linear combination of (n −1)2 + 1
linearly independent operators, and ﬁnd an explicit representation for the (n −1)2 + 1
operators. Show that the set of all these eigenoperators of |ψ⟩uniquely deﬁnes |ψ⟩.
Why is n = 2 a special case?
18.4 Consider two lines in the xy-plane, parallel to the x-axis. One line (the “high road”)
has y = L, while the other (the “low road”) has y = −L. Two particles, A and B, move
along these lines, in the direction of increasing x. On the y-axis, at the points (0, L)
and (0, −L), sit two two-state “atoms”. (See Fig. 18.2.) Let | ↑⟩+ and | ↓⟩+ denote

states of the atom at (0, L) and | ↑⟩−and | ↓⟩−denote states of the atom at (0, −L).
(The atoms really have zero angular momentum, but this notation is convenient.) If
particle A encounters one of these two-state atoms, it acts upon it as σz (multiplies
| ↓⟩+ or | ↓⟩−by -1); if particle B encounters one of the atoms, it acts upon it as σx
(interchanges | ↑⟩+ and | ↓⟩+ or | ↑⟩−and | ↓⟩−).
(a) Suppose the initial states of particles A and B are [|+⟩A + |−⟩A]/
√
2 and [|+⟩B +
|−⟩B]/

the ﬁnal state of the atoms is [| ↑⟩+ ⊗| ↓⟩−−| ↓⟩+ ⊗| ↑⟩−]/

particles A and B depends on which particle ﬁrst encounters the atoms.
(b) Show that the atoms and the trailing particle exchange Lx mod 2ℏ(modular angular
momentum) nonlocally. (The operator eiLxπ/ℏinterchanges |+⟩A and |−⟩A, |+⟩B and
|−⟩B, | ↑⟩+ and | ↑⟩−, and | ↓⟩+ and | ↓⟩−.)
(c) Assume that the initial states of particles A and B are |+⟩A and |−⟩B, respectively,
so the order in which the particles arrive at the atoms is not Lorentz-invariant. How can
the atoms and the trailing particle exchange modular angular momentum nonlocally,
when the trailing particle is different in different Lorentz frames? Resolve this paradox.
18.5 InanexperimenttotestBell’sinequality, AliceandBobsharepairsofspin-1/2particles;
Alice measures either a · σ or a′ · σ on her particles while Bob measures either b · σ
or b′ · σ on his, where a, a′, b and b′ are unit vectors in space. (See Sect. 3.4.) For
pairs in a singlet state, the quantum correlation between a measurement of a · σ by
Alice and b · σ by Bob is CQ(a, b) = −a · b. Consider a “superquantum” correlation
CSQ(a, b) for pairs of spin-1/2 particles such that
CSQ(a, b) = −sgn(a · b) ;
the measured correlations (and probabilities) depend only on the sign of a · b.
(a) Show that CSQ(a, b) is consistent with relativistic causality and that a suitable

(b) Find a superquantum correlation CSQ(a, b) that is continuous and differentiable
for all a and b, consistent with relativistic causality, and yields Eq. (18.20) for a suitable
choice of a, a′, b and b′.

but the effect of jamming at the spacetime point j is to turn these correlations into the
correlations of an equal mixture of the states | ↑⟩A ⊗| ↑⟩B and | ↓⟩A ⊗| ↓⟩B. Show
that jamming is consistent with relativistic causality if and only if the intersection of
the forward light cones of a and b lies entirely within the forward light cone of j.
18.7 Find a generalized density matrix ρ(t) with the following property: tr [ρ(t)A] is the
weak value of A at time t, for any observable A of a system preselected in the state
|Ψin⟩at time tin and postselected in the state |Ψfin⟩at time tfin. (See Prob. 9.6.)
Show that ρ(t) evolves in time as an ordinary density matrix:
ρ(t′) = U(t′ −t)ρ(t)U †(t′ −t) ,
where U(t′ −t) evolves the system over a time t′ −t. (Assume that the Hamiltonian
of the system does not depend on time.)

Assume P and Pd are conjugate to pointer positions Q and Qd, respectively. The

particles passing through a screen with two slits, as in Fig. 16.1. If they represent
particles passing through a screen, these measurements recall the two-slit experiment
of Sect. 18.1. In either case, the ﬁrst, third and fourth steps alone deﬁne a weak
measurement on a PPS ensemble, with the weak value of 

interference between | ↑⟩n and | ↓⟩n in |Ψin⟩even though there is no interference in
the postselected state |Ψfin⟩. Is it a paradox that we can exhibit interference without
interferenceintheﬁnalstate? Weknowthatweakvaluesdependonboththepreselected
state and the postselected state. (See Sect. 16.6.) Yet this measurement sequence,
including all four steps, leads to a paradox.
(a) Show that
⟨Ψfin|UdU|Ψin⟩= e−(i/ℏ)g0Pd cos P
exactly in the limit N →∞.
(b) Let Φd(Qd)Φ(Q) be the initial state of the pointers, with Φd(Qd)
=
(ϵ2π)−1/4e−Q2
d/2ϵ2. Suppose ﬁrst that Φ(Q) is an eigenstate of P. That is, U is
not a measurement but an operation that changes the relative phase between | ↑⟩n and
| ↓⟩n in the preselected state |Ψin⟩. The pointer Qd measures this change in relative
phase; it moves by g0 cos P. For example, if P = π, then U changes the relative
sign between | ↑⟩n and | ↓⟩n from + to −, and Qd moves by −g0 instead of g0. The
effect of U is paradoxical, because ⟨Ψfin|U = ⟨Ψfin|. It is true Ud comes between
⟨Ψfin| and U, but Ud represents a weak measurement; it should not affect the ﬁnal
state. Show, indeed, that ⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψfin⟩= 1 in the limit N →∞; there are no spin
ﬂips | ↑⟩n ↔| ↓⟩n in this limit.
(c) But for this PPS ensemble, the relevant calculation is not ⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψfin⟩but
⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψin⟩. Show that if |Ψin⟩were a typical state in which about half the spins
pointed up, and about half down, the x-axis, then 2N/2⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψin⟩would equal 1
in the limit N →∞; but |Ψin⟩is not a typical state and 2N/2⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψin⟩equals
e−ig0Pd/ℏ.
(d) Calculate ⟨Ψfin|Ud|Ψin⟩as a power series in g0 by expanding the exponential in
Ud. In this power series, terms of k-th order typically represent k spin ﬂips between
|Ψin⟩and |Ψfin⟩. For each k, estimate the contribution of all terms of k-th order.
(Approximate k! ≈kk, etc.) Show that in the limit N →∞, the largest contribution
comes from terms of order k ≈g0. Thus in the limit N →∞, the fraction of spins
ﬂipped vanishes but the number does not. If | ↑⟩n and | ↓⟩n represent states of a
particle passing through a screen with two slits, the weak measurement changes the
ﬁnal direction of approximately g0Pd/ℏof the particles.

286
18
The Quantum World
(e) Suppose now that U is a measurement; let Φ(Q) be a gaussian state in which the
expectation value of P vanishes, and ∆P is small. Then U does not change the relative
phases in |Ψin⟩, and during the Ud measurement, Qd moves by g0 (to order ∆P). Show
that Q does not move at all, but the uncertainty in Q increases from ∆Q in the initial
state to [(∆Q)2 + ℏ2(g0∆Pd)2/4(∆Q)2]1/2 ≥√ℏg0∆Pd. Show that the uncertainty
in the measured value of P due to the uncertainty in Qd is approximately

∆Qd/g0.
Thus the Ud measurement decreases the uncertainty in P, but the uncertainty in Q
increases such that the product of the uncertainties is not less than ℏ/2.
