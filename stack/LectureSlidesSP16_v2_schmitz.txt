Voltage and Energy
• Energy is the ability to do work, measured in joules (ܬ), BTUs, 
calories, kWh, mAh, etc.
• Voltage is the work done per unit charge (eg. ܬȀܥ) against a 
static electric field to move charge between two points
• Also, 1 volt (ͳ ܸ) is the electric potential difference between two 
points that will impart ͳ ܬof energy per coulomb (ͳ ܥ) of charge

L2Q5: For how long can such battery power an LED if it draws 50 mA of current?

Ohm’s law models the current and voltage 
relationship in conductors
Motivated by long-distance telegraphy, Georg Ohm conducted careful 
experimentation to find this widely-used approximate mathematical model:
ܫൌ
௏
ோ
where ܴൌߩ
௟
஺is resistance of a conductor (e.g. wire)
with length, ݈, and area ܣ, and where ߩis resistivity - a material parameter

L2Q7: If the resistance of one wire is ͳͲ ȳ, what is the resistance of two such wires in parallel?

Resistors are devices that obey Ohm’s Law 
• Resistors are used to set current when voltage is given
• Resistors are used to set voltage when current is given
• Power is always dissipated in resistors, and they heat up

• Code-based

What is professional responsibility?
Engineering professional responsibility encompasses the 
ethical obligations of engineers in their professional 
relationships with clients, employers, other engineers, 
and the public; these obligations include honesty and 
competence in technical work, confidentiality of 
proprietary information, collegiality in mentoring and 
peer review, and above all, the safety and welfare of the 
public, because engineers’ decisions can significantly 
affect society and the environment. –Prof. M. Loui
L4Q4: What ethical viewpoint is represented above?

Taking care of labeling
• Labeling of current direction and voltage polarity is important!
• For any element, we label current ܫflowing through it from the 
positive side of ܸto the negative side of ܸor vice-versa
Preferable for resistors
Here, V=IR
Can be conveniently used for sources
(If it’s a resistor, V = -IR)
L7Q4: In what direction does a positive current flow through a resistor?
L7Q5: In what direction does a positive current flow through a battery?

The sign of power is important

About Noise
Noise is random voltage fluctuation
• Thermal movement of electrons is circuit noise
• Power supplies often introduce noise to circuits
• Noise limits the precision of measurements
• Noise limits ability to collect or transfer information
• It is important to limit sources of noise
• Additive noise can be reduced by averaging (filtering)
• Noise can be reduced by advanced signal processing

A Noisy DC Measurement
Thermal noise in a sensor circuit can be dominant
• Noise power increases with temperature and resistance
• The average value of the noise is zero
L23Q2: How can we improve the precision of this VDR measurement?
Consider a voltage divider with a flex sensor.

Analog systems suffer from noise
Have you ever heard a noisy radio broadcast?

Lossy and Lossless Compression
• Lossy Compression
– Usually leads to larger DCR and savings
– Sometimes creates noticeable “artifacts”
– Examples: mp3, mpeg, jpeg
• Lossless Compression (keeping all information)
– Uses repetition or other data statistics
– Usually leads to smaller compression ratios (~2)
– Examples: PNG, run-length codes, Huffman codes…
L27Q3. Why was the cartoon samurai picture highly compressible?
L27Q4: Can we expect to achieve such DCR with the photograph?

Huffman Codes use bits efficiently
Use fewer bits for more common symbols. Here’s how:
1.
Order the symbols from most frequent on left to least frequent on right.
2.
From the two least frequent symbols, create two “branches” that 
connect them into a single end nodes of a tree graph.
3.
Mark the least frequent branch with a “0” and the most frequent a “1”
4.
Consider these two symbols be one new symbol with the combined 
frequency. Record this new frequency of the new node and return to 
step 1 (or step 2), considering nodes as new symbols.

you can separate the symbols without confusion.)

Light consists of (Energetic) Photons
• Photons are sometimes called wave packets
• Each photon carries an amount of energy given by
E(eV) = 1240/λ(nm) where ͳ ܸ݁ൌͳǤ͸ ൈͳͲିଵଽJ

Creating electron-hole pairs in 
Semiconductors
• An electron in a material can absorb a photon’s energy
• An electron can sometimes lose energy to emit a photon
• Semiconductor electrons have a gap in allowed energy, Eg
• Photons with energy bigger than the gap are absorbed
• Absorbed photons can create usable electrical energy

by GaN (Eg= 3.4 eV), and by diamond carbon (Eg= 5.5 eV)?
